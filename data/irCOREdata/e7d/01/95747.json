Amongst these \nare discourses that, in the last decade, frequently invoke a dichotomy between so-called \n'tradition' and supposed 'modernity' only to subsume the latter within the former.  These \ndiscourses on tradition work by depicting, for instance, heroes and especially heroines \nwhose life-styles are westernised, consumerist and urban but whose hearts, rooted in \ntraditional (read 'Indian') values, push them to sacrifice, for the sake of their families, \ntheir individual desires.  In this context, theorists have focused on the ways in \ncommercial Indian cinema appeals to the public imagination: firstly, by intermingling \nrecognisable emotional concerns with diffuse anxieties concerning family values and \npublic morality and secondly, by offering what appear to be personal solutions to \nbroader social or national tensions (Dickey 1993: 134, 141; Nandy 1998:3-12; \nChakravarthy 1998: 99-101; Uberoi 1999, 2001).  Madhava Prasad (1998:4) believes \nthat Hindi cinema has functioned as a site for the 'production and exploration of \nnational identity and ideology' while Fareed Kazmi argues that in India where so many \n \n 2 \npeople live below the poverty-line, Hindi cinema plays a crucial role in ideological \n'image-building' (1999:16).  If such claims are accurate, then an analysis of audience \nresponses to specific aspects of Hindi film texts becomes crucial to an understanding of \nthe culture at large.   \n \nAccordingly, I have spent fifteen months interviewing South Asian viewers in their late \nteens and early twenties about their feelings towards and understandings of Hindi films.  \nWhile I have conducted over a hundred brief interviews in a public context outside \ncinema theatres in Bombay and London, or during film showings, the bulk of my data \nhas been gathered in private one-on-one interviews with a sample drawn from diverse \nreligious, class and caste backgrounds; these interviews included extended discussions \nabout family and community as well as personal beliefs and attitudes regarding gender \nand sexuality.   \n \nDharmesh Darshan's Raja Hindustani, which won a series of 'Filmfare' and 'Screen \nVideocon' awards and became a massive box-office success in 1996-7, has received \nbarely any critical attention compared to giant 'family' romances like Dilwale \nDulhaniya Le Jayenge\/ (Lit.) The One with the Heart Takes the Bride (Aditya Chopra, \nIndia, 1995) and Hum Aapke Hain Koun \u2026!\/What am I to You \u2026!  (Sooraj Barjatya, \nIndia, 1994).1  This film, however, was one that was brought up repeatedly in \ninterviews, by young people keen to express their views about issues as diverse as \nwomen's attire, community policing of adolescent sexuality and the 'censorship' of \nkissing in Indian commercial films. Here, I will be enquiring what narrative and visual \n \n 3 \nstrategies on the part of the director can account for the pleasure provided by the film \nand exploring the ways in which discourses of gender and sexuality in the film might \nbe understood by young viewers.  Crucially, the apparently coherent textual readings \noffered in each of the following sections are not being provided as absolute or \nconclusive and only gain relevance when interrogated alongside the film's surrounding \nsociocultural context and the multitude of audience responses available. \n \nII: Establishing oppositions: duality as a primary lens \n \nIn order to recognise the complexities of Raja Hindustani's narrative it is important to \nmap out the basics of the plot, which follows a time honoured structure of rich-girl \nmeets poor-boy, rich-girl marries poor-boy, couple are parted, couple are reunited. \n \nThe wealthy Aarti Sehgal (Karishma Kapoor) and her father (Suresh Oberoi) are united \nby affection and a shared birthday; Aarti's stepmother, Shaalu Sehgal (Archana Puran \nSingh) is jealous of the bond between father and daughter; she plots with her brother to \ndispossess Aarti. While her father is on a foreign business trip, Aarti chooses to spend \nher vacation at an Indian hill-station called Palankhet. She is accompanied on her \njourney by a duo of minders, the 'macho' Kamal and her 'effeminate' brother Gulab.  At \nthe airport serving Palanketh, the orphan hero, Raja Hindustani (Aamir Khan), a rural \ntaxi-driver, is introduced. Aarti agrees to stay with Raja's aunt (Farida Jalal) and uncle, \nwho are, interestingly, not blood relatives. Romance blossoms between Raja and Aarti. \nWhen a thunderstorm sends them into an intimate embrace, the youngsters \n \n 4 \nacknowledge their passion.  Soon after, Mr Sehgal arrives to convey Aarti back to \nBombay.  Distraught, Aarti publicly acknowledges her love for the penniless Raja and, \nmarrying him against her father's will, she is outcast from her family but happy.  When \nher father initiates reconciliation, Raja and Aarti are subjected to the malicious \nmachinations of Aarti's stepfamily.  Parted by Raja's suspicious pride and Aarti's na\u00efve \ntrust, the couple are only reunited by love for their baby, which has been born in the \ninterim.  After a violent fight, the villains are vanquished and the non-traditional \n'Indian' family is once more whole. \n \nRaja Hindustani opens on a close up of a birthday cake, childishly decorated and, \nalthough the camera swiftly cuts to a more traditional establishing shot of a spacious \ndrawing-room in which clusters of elegant guests sip drinks or chat softly, the 'scene' \nhas already been set and an attempt made to position the audience. This is done via the \nconnotative significance of the birthday cake, which joins a whole ensemble of Hindi \nfilm confectionary to conjure up a chain of symbolic associations: in commercial films, \nbirthdays \u2013 with their emphasis on an individual's uniqueness \u2013 tend to be celebrated by \nwealthy, urban, westernised families or couples (Saari 1985: 54 in Dern\u00e9 2000: 93), \nwhereas families presented as more 'traditionally Indian' might be depicted celebrating \nthe birth of a child, a 'sagai'  (engagement) or another religious festival.  In this context, \nMr Sehgal is introduced as a dignified man looking affectionately for his now grown-\nup daughter who descends the main staircase to a soundtrack of saxophone music and a \nlingering tracking shot which displays her bright colours, feminine curves and artless \nexpression for the inspection of guests and viewers alike. Mrs Sehgal, in stark contrast, \n \n 5 \nis portrayed as a pretentious, affected woman, whose halter-top blouse and flimsy sari \ntestify to her expensive tastes and lack of 'moral judgement', just as her westernised \naccent is suggestive of her ambiguous national identity.  She is thus set up, from the \noutset, as an acceptable object of revulsion: her snobbery is un-Indian, her concern with \nappearance, immodest or unfeminine, and her stepmother status unnatural. Aarti, by \ncomparison, is approved as not only a loving and faithful daughter but also, despite her \nwestern garments and her father's riches, a true-hearted Indian girl who values the rural \nsimplicity of an Indian hill town like Palankhet over the 'glamour' of Switzerland.   \n \nIf the oppositions birth-mother\/step-mother and western\/Indian have been established \nduring the opening sequence, the contrast of sophistication and simplicity is firmly \nposited in the series of scenes leading up to and immediately succeeding the 'heroine \nmeets hero' moment. On the journey to Palankhet, the audience's initial sympathy for \nAarti is eroded by her portrayal as a spoilt rich kid.  Her values \u2013 wishing to stay at the \nTaj Hotel, imperious directions to the bumbling minders, impatience at the non-\nappearance of her taxi \u2013 are linked to those of a whole host of other capricious film \nheroines2. Her independence is thus construed as a negative by-product of her wealthy \nupbringing and subtly undermined. In amusing contrast, the first shot of the hero, Raja \n(Aamir Khan), is a close-up of his boots, which are rough and unpolished but strong.  \nComedy \u2013 in the form of the mistaken gender identity of the 'butch' Kamal and her \n'camp' brother Gulab \u2013 only serves to highlight the 'genuine' masculine attributes of the \ntaxi-driver hero, Raja, and Aarti's unalloyed femininity, which is offered up to us, the \nspectators, via a series of disjointed and fragmented close-ups focused on parts of her \n \n 6 \nface and body as well as on Raja's face as he surveys her. His instant recognition of \nAarti as an 'object of desire' is naturalised and purged of guilty connotations by the \nintervention of his side-kick, a little boy, whose droll remarks draw attention to the \nonset of romance by mildly ridiculing it.   \n \nThe deep-seated belief that a young man and woman thrown together in any context \nwill be unable to resist falling in love and\/ or having sex with each other is, obviously, \nnot just a construct of Hindi commercial cinema3, although the notion of platonic cross-\ngender friendships is less common in Hindi films than in, say, Hollywood movies. The \npresence of a child, and of two sexually ambiguous 'others' in the scene that unites the \nhero and heroine for the first time is not accidental. The iconic display of a wedding \ngroup with a bride and groom during Raja's song 'Aye ho mere zindagi mein, tum bahar \nbanke' (You've come into my life as the spring) \u2013 which is sung during an interlude in \ntheir car journey to Palankhet \u2013 connotes the as yet unacknowledged longing of the two \nprotagonists to be united by a traditional bond.  Furthermore, the displaying of the \nheroine\/actress as an object of desire during this first song sequence deserves some \ncomment in the light of long-running debates over the gendered nature of the \nfilmic\/spectatorial 'gaze'.   \n \nMuch of what Laura Mulvey argues in her constantly discussed essay 'Visual Pleasure \nand Narrative Cinema' (1975) is relevant for a study of Hindi films.4  According to \nMulvey, \n \n \n 7 \n[i]n their traditional exhibitionist role women are simultaneously looked at and \ndisplayed, with their appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact \u2026 \nwoman displayed as sexual object is the leitmotif of erotic spectacle \u2026. \nMainstream film neatly combines spectacle and narrative. (Note, however, how in \nthe musical song and dance numbers interrupt the flow of the diegesis). (1975) \n \nAlthough clearly open to challenge at a variety of levels5, Mulvey's argument offers \ninsights when charted against scenes from commercial Hindi films.  In this instance, as \nRaja sings \u2013 in obedience to a request from Aarti \u2013 the journey to Plankhet and hence \nthe linear narrative is put on hold: instead, what we are offered is a series of striking \npictorial clips in which aspects of Aarti's face and body are subjected to scrutiny.  The \ncamera cuts jerkily between Raja, singing or playing with his young companion, and \nAarti, sitting under a tree, zooming in to capture her lips as they tentatively sip hot tea \nand her lips again, as she sucks on a piece of sugar cane, her innocent gestures all the \nmore erotic for their seeming homeliness.  While money \u2013 in the form of 'tips', \npayments and repayments6  \u2013 mediates external relations between Aarti and Raja in the \nearly scenes of their acquaintance and is critiqued for its corrupting potential, Raja's \nright to look at and consume Aarti with his eyes is never questioned.  A number of \nIndian film theorists have written about the ways in which atypical Hindi film heroines \nare represented7.  In contrast, invoking the notion of 'scopophilic pleasure' Fareed \nKazmi writes that most typical Hindi films open with \n \n \n 8 \nthe women as objects of the combined gaze of the spectator and all the male \nprotagonists in the film. She is isolated, glamorous, on display, sexualised [as \nin] \u2026 Raja Hindustani, \u2026 but as the narrative progresses, she falls in love with \nthe main (male) protagonist and becomes his 'property', losing her outward \nglamorous characteristics, her generalised sexuality, her show-girl connotations; \nher eroticism is subject to the male star alone. (1999:188) \n \nIn line with these observations, initial shots of Aarti depict her stillness and passivity, \nas opposed to Raja's movement and vitality. This pattern is echoed a few scenes later \nwhen she is shown awaking from her first night in Palankhet, wearing a skimpy satin \nnightdress, and stretching sensuously to the stylised and crooning saxophone while \nRaja does vigorous physical exercises in the garden outside.  Based on audience \nresearch with young female viewers, however, it is obvious that pleasure is achievable \nthrough contemplation of Raja's watching face and his active body: young women and \ngirls I spoke to indicated that they found something satisfyingly suggestive and even \npowerful in the notion of watching the watcher without his knowledge and commenting \non his physique to each other. There appears to be no necessary connection between \nsuch (voyeuristic) visual pleasure and the identification with the male, which Mulvey's \nessay posits as essential to our experience of the hero. By presenting my reading of two \ncrucial sequences in this film, as well as of some youth responses to these sequences, I \nhope to illuminate, at least partially, both the allure and, if there is one, the agenda of \nHindi films such as Raja Hindustani. \n \n \n 9 \nIII: Policing attire: women's virtue; men's violence \n \nThe juxtaposition of imagery at the beginning of the film sets up a series of oppositions \nthat imply a certain way of viewing the social world both on and off-screen.  The \nloveless 'modernity' and (implicitly) un-Indian pomp of Aarti's family home is \ndistinguished from the simple dignity of Raja's rural existence and his 'traditional' \n'Indian' beliefs; her father's and step-mother's strained relationship is displayed more \nstarkly by the mutual love and understanding of Raja's aunt and uncle.  Raja's \nmasculinity and Aarti's femininity are humorously foregrounded by Gulab's effeminate \nwhining and Kamal's aggressive demeanour just as Raja's 'active' gaze, his subject-\nstatus, is enhanced by Aarti's 'passive' gratification at being gazed at. These supposed \noppositions form no mere introductory schema that is eroded as the movie progresses \nbut are intimately linked to the narrative, and function to structure what might \notherwise seem random plot incidents or character 'types' into a seemingly coherent \npsychological universe. This hypothesis was confirmed during in-depth interviews with \nyoung spectators in Bombay and London who demonstrated and emphasised their \nknowledgeable stance vis-\u00e0-vis the roles, attitudes and actions of the characters. \n \nIn the 'red dress' sequence and its aftermath, we are presented by the director, \nDharmesh Darshan, with what can be seen as either an elaborate set-piece of moralising \nor an invitation to take sides in a debate over a significant aspect of women's autonomy: \ntheir right to dress as they please. Aarti's minders \u2013 whose taste is as questionable as \ntheir gender status \u2013 persuade Aarti to purchase a skimpy dress that she sees in a shop \n \n 10 \nwindow in Palankhet town. A quick series of shot-reverse-shots depicting the minders' \nexpressions, Raja's face, and Aarti's body in the dress, are a dramatic precursor to the \nscene's violent d\u00e9nouement. Raja, at one and the same time a 'prude' with regards to \nwestern fashion and a protector of women's honour, is positioned through his \ndisapproval of the dress in direct contrast to us, the admiring audience, and to the \nscreen 'others' implied, but at first not shown, by the camera. The camera's extended \njourney, from Karishma\/Aarti's shoes, up her smooth legs, to the risqu\u00e9 hem of the \ndress and then to the coy expression on her face, is again accompanied by a clich\u00e9d riff, \nthe musical equivalent to a wolf whistle. Her assumption of a stereotypically 'sexy' \nvoice and her deliberate parody of a model's catwalk journey are inserted as the basis \nfor Raja's squirming discomfort. His confusion as he turns away from her is contrasted \nimplicitly with our voyeuristic wish to see more of her; his frown of displeasure is both \na warning to Aarti and to her audience; the na\u00efve applause of the minders and the little \nboy's quizzical amusement are undercut repeatedly by Raja's fixed disapproval.  In \ncontrast to Aarti's amused but tolerant acceptance of his absurd efforts at 'dressing up' \nin the previous sequence, this scene displays the relative importance of men's opinions \nvis-\u00e0-vis those of women. When Aarti approaches Raja saying, 'it seems that Raja \ndoesn't like my dress', his expression intimates his embarrassment and he comments \nthat he will tell her the 'truth', the dress is 'not good', she should change at once: her \nown estimation of him in the previous sequence as a 'sachche dil wale' (true-hearted \nman) returns here to haunt her, setting him up as the arbiter of her 'honour' and virtue.  \n \n \n 11 \nIf one is in any doubt over the relevance of popular-cultural contributions to debates \nover women's dress and conduct in contemporary India, one has only to pick up a \nnewspaper and read about young people of differing castes murdered by their families \nfor being seen together, women stripped and paraded naked through the streets for \nsupposedly aiding illicit romance and others, beaten to death for allegedly giving birth \noutside of wedlock8.  In Raja Hindustani, however, the bitter conflict between \nindividual freedom and 'public' morality is construed not as one between Aarti's right to \nselect her own apparel and Raja's right to legislate what she wears but as one of \n'practical knowledge': his discourse, which invokes the dress's transgressive\/come-\nhither connotations, is placed in opposition to that of the minders when they ask, 'What \ndoes he know about \"fashion\"?'  Responding to such divergent discourses on women's \nclothing, Meeta, a seventeen year-old Bombay viewer from a lower middle-class family \nconflates comments she has overheard in cinemas with those she witnesses on the \nscreen and asserts, 'wear sleeveless dresses, wear short skirts, but not the stuff that will \nmake boys whistle on the streets like in Raja Hindustani when the girl wears the red \ndress, and the boys hanging around shout \u2018higher, higher\u2019[\u2026] boys also get spoiled like \nthat'.  She thus places not only the invitation of harassment but also the corruption of \n'boys' (both on and off screen) firmly on female shoulders.  \n \nMeeta is not alone in holding this view. Eight out of ten male viewers in their late teens \nand early twenties responded that dresses like the one in the scene under consideration \ncould be 'dangerous' to young women and could make girls the target of 'eve-teasing' \nand hence should not be worn.  One stressed that he would view the wearing of that red \n \n 12 \ndress as a clear 'invitation' to himself and those he termed 'road-side Romeos' to harass \nand 'tease' the wearer.  The director, it would appear, represents aspects of this debate \nbetween alternative discourses on clothing: as Aarti approaches the camera laughing \ngaily and bantering with Gulab and Kamal at a roadside stall, the camera inter-cuts \nback and forth between a group of men drinking beer and staring at her, and Raja, \nhovering uncertainly at some distance and hiding his face in 'shame' at her \u2013 \npresumably 'shameful' \u2013 display.   \n \nAarti bends and is shown from behind, with the skirt of her dress rising as the group of \nlounging men leer, drink and become the focal point of the camera's (and the viewer's) \nattention. In the next shot Aarti is peripheral; danger and threat \u2013 signified by a huge \nfore-grounded knee and a bottle of beer belonging to one of the louts who is flagrantly \ndressed in western designer jeans, base-ball cap and shades \u2013 takes centre stage as a \nmale voice shouts: 'Hey sweetheart!  What a dress! It's so small!  If you weren't \nwearing it you'd look even better!'9  I was told by interviewees that in the theatres at \nwhich they viewed Raja Hindustani, the dress sequence evoked enormous audience \nparticipation, men cat-calling and whistling, shouting 'Higher! Higher!' and 'Take it \noff!', young women yelling 'Oh no!' or shouting back at the men in their audience. \nCritiquing the modality of the scene, and also, implicitly, an imputed ideological \nstance, twenty-two year old Jasmine, a graduate in Bombay, commented that the red \ndress sequence highlighted the 'fear' in the eyes of the actress, Karishma, and made her \nseem like a 'useless, helpless object, waiting to be rescued', while Sonali, a college \nstudent there, was adamant that '[e]ven if you go around totally veiled from top to toe \n \n 13 \nthe men will whistle and make comments. So why not show heroines in short clothes?' \nSuch responses to the question 'How did you feel about the scene?' suggest the complex \ninterweaving of text and context in the minds of many young female viewers. \n \nThe rest of this sequence is charged with menace by the emphatic drumbeat, repeated \njuddering pauses and fragmented shots of Aarti's face. The situation escalates, \nironically, to the tune of a Hindi film song from the Akshay Kumar-Raveena Tandon \nhit Mohra: 'Tu cheez badi hai mast, mast' (what a gorgeous thing you are!)10 Raja's \nsubsequent violent intervention may be viewed at several levels: within the narrative it \nserves to bring him back into the frame of action again after a period of silence and \npassivity; symbolically, having been shown to be in thrall to the confident sensuality of \nAarti in the preceding scenes \u2013 his authority as a man undermined by his burgeoning \npassion for her \u2013 he is placed firmly back in control as the violent defender of her 'izzat' \n(honour); in addition, the physicality of his violence serves as a reminder of the \nsexuality he has been suppressing. When he has taken on and vanquished the villainous \nlouts \u2013 almost killing in the process \u2013 his transformation from tame youth to heroic man \nis complete: his disproportionate violence and anger are the markers of his \nrighteousness as well as of his masculinity.  Such a reading can be detected in the \ncomments of viewers like Jasmine, who notes that such scenes 'show men reacting \nphysically when their masculinity is challenged. Men are constantly forced, \nsubconsciously, to take themselves too seriously \u2013 anything that challenges their image \nis supposed to be destroyed, most often with violence.'  In rebuttal of Aarti's vexed \nquestion 'Why did you make such a scene for such a small thing?', Raja says, 'this is not \n \n 14 \nthe city; daughters and daughters-in-law are treated with respect here; those who don't \nknow how to respect them should be [\u2026] given a kicking', suggesting that his \nunderstanding of the ways of the village is intimately bound up with his 'image', his \nnotion of himself and his view of masculinity.    \n \nThe spectre of rape hovers at the margins of our consciousness, making Raja's \nvigilantism all the more acceptable and undermining Aarti's rejection of his violence \nand his advice when she shouts, 'How dare you! Who are you to tell me what to wear \nand what not to?' Her question is itself ambiguous, signalling as it does not her right to \nchoose what to wear but merely her refusal of his claim on her \u2013 his claim to be a \nperson who has the right to tell her what to wear and what not to wear \u2013 in India, a \nparent, uncle, brother or fianc\u00e9\/husband. Rather than supporting Aarti's autonomy as a \nwoman, the narrative further undermines her position by inspiring sympathy for Raja's \nworking-class status when he replies despondently, 'Yes, who am I to tell you \nanything?' In the situations that follow, Aarti\/Karishma is represented in traditional \nIndian costumes, salwar-kurtas that cover her entirely, and directed to use playful, \nchildlike gestures (clutching her ears to imply contrition, smiling, sidling up to him) to \ndistance her from the vampish connotations of the red dress, while Raja is presented as \ndignified and forgiving.   \n \nEschewing continuity in favour of a non-diegetic song sequence (Kithna pyaara tumhe, \nRabne banayaa\/How lovely God has made you), the growing intimacy between Raja \nand Aarti is conveyed via lyrics, temporal shifts and fantasy images intercut with \n \n 15 \npicturesque views of scenery in 'Palankhet'11.  It is interesting to note that the few lyrics \nwhich fall to Aarti praise all Raja's non-physical qualities while those awarded to him \nfocus principally on her physical beauty: coincident with the perspective of the fantasy \nwhich follows \u2013 Raja sees images of his 'dream-girl'\/'show-girl' Aarti in various \nclassical dance outfits \u2013 this reinforces the male point of view within the narrative.  \nWith this aspect of the film in mind, I now turn to the second major sequence in Raja \nHindustani to occasion controversy, the 'smooch' scene, which neatly ends the mock-\ninnocent romanticism of the first hour.  It is in and around this scene that powerful \ndiscourses about sexuality are invoked both by the director and by the audience.  \n \nIV: A kiss is never just a kiss: various responses to on-screen passion  \n \nDirectly after the song in which Raja fantasises his beloved, in a use of the weather \nridiculed as typically clich\u00e9d by several young viewers, rain sends the young people to \nshelter beneath a tree.  All around them the verdant landscape is suffused by thunderous \nclouds.  The camera cuts back and forth between their faces, framing them in medium \nclose-up two-shots where we can see his bemused countenance but only her profile; \nthus her emotions are held away from us, less transparent than his, which allows the \ndirector to imply that she is still 'innocent' of sexual intentions right until the very act of \nkissing itself.  Her laughter, the rain and the tinkling sound-track act as a foil to his \nconfusion as he \u2013 presumably recognising his desire for what it is \u2013 moves away from \nher out of the frame. His turmoil and guilt are picked up in a subsequent close-up; the \nunrelenting rain and her friendly, 'thoughtless' physicality \u2013 she laughs repeatedly, \n \n 16 \nthrows her head back, takes his hand \u2013 as she calls to him to take shelter beside her are \nartfully constructed by the director to enhance both her sex appeal and her aura of \ninnocence.  As a 'good'  woman she is shown to be unaware of sexual impulses, equally \nunable to recognise the effect she has on him as she is to identify her own burgeoning \ndesire. A perfect visual metonym for a temptress, Aarti's glistening and ornamented \nhand and wrist become the focal point for Raja's crumbling self-control: his move \ntowards her is presented as not of his volition. It takes a thunderbolt and a flash of \nlightening to send her into his arms.  Another bolt of thunder and drum roll on the \nsound track signal her sexual awakening. \n \nThe camera captures Raja and Aarti's first tentative and then passionate kiss \u2013 which \nlasts roughly forty seconds12\u2013 in a way that is unusual for contemporary Hindi \ncommercial cinema, which normally censors lip to lip contact in favour of the \nkissing of female waists, hands, shoulders, necks and abdomens. While the director, \nspeaking of Raja Hindustani, called it 'the perfect combination of body and soul, of \nthe heart and the mind', based 'solely on [his] convictions and beliefs',13 one \ngenerally positive reviewer writes, 'The kiss that Karishma Kapoor and Aamir Khan \nshared \u2026 was a bit too much for Bollywood'.14  In line with this view, my interview \ndata indicates that some young women felt threatened by the direct breaking of the \n'no-kissing' code. For instance, Sunita (19) and Munni (19), both students, felt \n'shown up' and 'embarrassed' in front of their families by the length of the kiss \u2013 'we \ndidn't know where to look', 'I didn't want father to see me watching that', 'it was a \nshock' \u2013 and Meeta was quick to condemn the scene: \n \n 17 \n \nMeeta: Raja Hindustani when they are under the tree, that five minute \nscene of Karishma and Aamir Khan standing [pause] it's been made way \ntoo long and unnecessary because it didn\u2019t have to be longer than a minute \nand it has a really bad effect on girls and boys. [\u2026] I thought [the censors] \nshouldn\u2019t have shown that; I felt nothing was good in that scene[\u2026] I liked \nthe film as a whole but [\u2026] it has very bad, shameful effects.   \n \nIn the world of the film too, moral condemnation is anticipated: the beginning of the \nheroine's 'punishment' is signalled when Raja, the man, breaks off the kiss. As she \nremains, face uptilted, lost in her sexual daze for some seconds longer, he mutters \nthe word 'No!' indicating his greater masculine awareness of their transgression and \nhis ability to 'control' himself where she is in the throes of a controlling passion.  She \nremains smiling and touching her lips in sensual pleasure until she sees his \nexpression, at which point her 'horror' surfaces and she flees the scene of her 'crime'.  \nHer motivation for running is ambiguous, consistent with a wish for escape either \nfrom her own 'shameless' arousal or from Raja's condemnation.  After the thunder of \ndrums and choral music, which accompanies her run through the wet forests and \nfields, Aarti's father arrives to convey her back to the city. This could be viewed as a \nreminder of the familial control and ties which await young people who are so \nfoolish as to fall in love; several of the young people I spoke with outside cinemas \ndescribed it as such, either pejoratively \u2013 Nimesh (21), an Art student, thought that \nthe director got cold feet ('woh dar gaya, yaar') \u2013 or approvingly \u2013 Hitesh (19), \n \n 18 \nwhose father runs a shop, was pleased that 'the girl remembered her heritage and felt \nsome shame'.  \n \nMeeta's vehement dislike of the kiss and her belief that it lasts 'five minutes' are \nrevealing of the kinds of sentiments provoked by even a brief transgression of \nexpectations in a Hindi film; the reasons she gives for her disapproval \u2013 'if there \nwere families there then they would have felt shame and if a boy and a girl had come \ntogether to the cinema to watch the film then it might give them ideas' \u2013 clearly \nreflect moral conservatism, amongst certain strata of youth, around issues relating to \nsexuality as well as a tendency to condemn Hindi films on the grounds of  'effects'.  \nInterestingly, all three negative responses quoted show a keen awareness of how the \nscreen kiss or the watching of it would be perceived by others, and do not rule out \nthe pleasure provided by the sequence if viewed in privacy. Amina (21), a \nhousewife, was eager to explain that she enjoyed the way the actress touched the \nactor's head during the kiss, 'just as I do when I get him [her husband] to myself; it \nmade me remember him and I wanted to be beside him at that moment.'    \n \nAmina's more intimate associations with the kiss may well be linked to a sense that, \nas a married woman, an acknowledging of erotic desire for her husband would be \nconsidered legitimate. Her willingness to express enjoyment was echoed by Sunil \n(20), an electrician's apprentice whom I spoke to outside a film theatre, who said that \nhe was 'asleep for most of the film' but 'woke up and stayed awake after that sexy \nkiss'.  However, not all young viewers who felt comfortable with the kiss sequence's \n \n 19 \nlack of vulgarity15, responded emotionally to it. Sonali insisted that it didn't move \nher at all because of its inability of portray a 'love' which she found realistic or \nbelievable: '[T]hey're outside getting wet in the rain [\u2026] God knows what happens \nto them but suddenly she comes close to him and they smooch [English] and they are \nall wet and it's all seen and the men in the theatre where I saw it were so happy they \nwere whistling.'  What this comment highlights, perhaps unwittingly, is the way in \nwhich Raja Hindustani's efforts to remain within the Hindi film tradition of \neroticism robs it of psychological coherence for some young female viewers.  \nNevertheless, argues Lalitha Gopalan, the state-imposed obscenity code governing \nsexual displays on screen has been a boon rather than a hindrance to the film \nindustry through its ability to inflame desire and enhance spectatorial pleasure. She \nexamines the ways in which the fragmentation of the female form via camera \n'withdrawal' at crucial moments can be equated with the sexual practice of 'coitus \ninterruptus' (1998:126).  Viewed through such a lens, the kiss sequence tentatively \ntransgresses several codes: first, by refusing a large section of the audience its \nexpectation of perennial teasing anticipation (and providing some of them, like \nSunil, with unexpected pleasure) and second, by showing the actress as an equal \nparticipant in an extended and unambiguous sexual event (thus causing more \nconstrained and\/or conservative youth to feel disturbed and embarrassed or morally \njudgmental, at least in retrospect, about vicarious participation in the kiss). Having \nexemplified some of the ways in which young viewers (choose to) answer questions \nabout filmic representations of gender\/sexuality alongside more 'ideological' \nanalyses \u2013 which assume the director's intention to direct viewers towards a given \n \n 20 \nmoral schema \u2013 the difficulty of asserting that any single reading of a Hindi film is \nthe most 'valid' or likely to be shared by young viewers can be better understood.   \n \nV: The allure of suffering: emotional identification and audience pleasure \n \nAt no point in the film is emotion so clearly presented to the audience as a basis for \nidentification as in the aftermath to the kiss sequence.  When Raja sings his \nimpassioned plea to his beloved asking her not to leave him, he has tears in his eyes and \nthe rage of the drunken performing woman lends his pain mythic proportions.  Thus the \npractical preposterousness of Aarti's presence in dark-glasses and leopard print outfit is \nmasked and suppressed by the pathos of the events.  Similarly, the absurdity of the \nmotley collection of people at Raja and Aarti's wedding \u2013 cross dressing minders, slap-\nstick Sikh friend \u2013 is concealed by Aarti's grief at her father's absence and anger. Where \nlittle in the rich-girl meets poor-boy plot is original for an experienced Hindi film \naudience16, and even less in his idyllic poverty and her pampered town life fits the \nconventions of na\u00efve realism which would allow a majority of viewers to make \nsustained connections between their own modalities and those of the film, the \nsentiments of two young lovers being torn apart first by convention and later by the \nmachinations of evil relatives appeal directly to the audience's experience in a manner \nsimilar to that of popular soap operas. Analysing the responses of a number of Dallas \nviewers to the programme, Ien Ang (1985: 44) uses the term 'emotional realism' to \nexplain the connections forged by viewers between their relatively mundane existences \nand the glamorous ones of the characters on the programme. This type of realism, she \n \n 21 \nsuggests, inheres not in the day-to-day circumstances of viewers and characters but \nrather in a more symbolic or connotative realm in which domestic arguments, betrayals, \njoy and sorrow form bridges between on and off-screen life.  \n \nInterviewing young Bombay viewers, I was told repeatedly of their undeclared or \nthwarted romances, secret liaisons and precarious flirtations: many invoked Hindi films \nas both the physical (the theatres provide space for being together) and the \npsychological (a particular moment in a film was transformatory) locations for turning \npoints in their consciousness about relationships with families and lovers. Using Ang's \nparadigm of 'emotional realism', the subplot of treachery and familial deceit which \ngains significance in the latter half of Raja Hindustani could be said to hold pleasure \nfor this section of the audience primarily through its evocation of the fraught \npsychological world in which a couple are not allowed to experience marital bliss \nwithout the interference and manipulation of their families.  In the absence of Raja's \nfamily, Aarti's ties to her natal home are utilised as reasons for conflict. The scene \nduring which Raja castigates Aarti for accepting a gift from her father is notable for its \nimplicit acceptance of his controlling aggression and for its endorsement of her \nabsolute capitulation. Young viewers interviewed were divided between those who \nridiculed Aarti's abdication of subjectivity and those who praised it as a key attribute of \na wife.  Predictably, perhaps, younger unmarried women (17-19), from conservative \nfamilies, did not or did not feel able to criticise Aarti's submissiveness, while \nmarried\/working women aged over twenty, and men, were less anxious about the \nimplications of the positions they took up, asserting confidently that 'she should go \n \n 22 \nback to her family if he treats her badly', and later, that 'divorce happens: that's modern \nlife.'  \n \nIn this context, Fareed Kazmi correctly argues that the disagreeable behaviour of natal \nfamily members or outsiders which 'traps' the heroines, 'reinforces their dependence on \nthe heroes who are the only ones who have the potential of liberating them from their \nvulnerable and oppressed states.'  He continues by pointing out that 'even the foreign-\neducated, extremely well to do Aarti \u2026 confesses her helplessness and total \ndependence on her non-literate, cab driver husband' (1999:189).  Her statement, 'You \nare a man and can go wherever you want to, but where can I go, Rajaji? Ever since I \nentered your life, I have closed all other roads for myself. Never leave me and go' is \nboth, as Kazmi suggests, a reminder of the film's ideological subtext about gender roles \nand, perhaps, a direct appeal to the feelings of Indian women who have chosen love \nover arranged marriages and feel rightly or wrongly that their individual identity is \ndefined by the success or failure of their relationships with their husbands.  Read in this \nway, Aarti's statement is not simply a pathetic confession of practical inability to live \nwithout her husband (she does, after-all, survive for several months without him after \ntheir angry break) but an appeal to the perceived 'emotional reality' that a section of the \naudience inhabits.  There is little doubt, then, that audience members will have diverse \ninterpretations and even contradictory responses to each scene, moving from \nidentification to irony or critique depending on the emotional connection they feel with \nparticular characters at particular times and the centrality of emotion within their \nexperience of the film as a whole. \n \n 23 \n \nRaja Hindustani embeds normative discourses on gender and sexuality in spectacular \nvisual set pieces, uniting these with 'emotional realism' to provide the audience with a \npleasurable mixture that takes some unravelling. Thus, despite its benign invocation of \n(homo)sexuality through the stereotypically cross-dressed Gulab and Kamal, and its \npositing of 'bonds of the heart' as superior to or at least on par with those of 'blood', it is \na typical commercial Hindi film. Aiming, perhaps, to capture the growing number of \nmiddle-class female students who frequent cinema theatres, several commercial Hindi \n'romances' have, in the last decade, moved towards a more balanced eroticisation of \nhero and heroine, and Raja Hindustani, with its interest in issues of dress\/role playing \nand social status is no exception. However, one of the most interesting aspects of the \n'red dress' sequence is the fact that the apparently public space we are shown is \nbounded by men who make judgements about Aarti's status based only on what she \nwears; the space depicted thus becomes a 'male space' into which the heroine intrudes, \nboth by the physical act of walking and by breaking a code which insists that women \nhave to remain covered or else be considered to be sexually available and inviting. Her \nsubsequent rescue by the hero and the punishment of the 'deviant' men can, in this \ncontext, be viewed as entirely consonant with the film's dominant ideological stance: \nreal\/Indian men protect women regardless of the folly displayed by the women; \nreal\/Indian women understand the error of their ways and alter their behaviour to suit \naccepted patriarchal dictates.   \n \n \n 24 \nThe build up to 'the smooch' sequence serves to remind the audience that sexuality is \ndangerous in ways beyond individual choice\/moral control and that adolescents thrown \ntogether might not set out to do anything 'wrong' but that their (hetero)sexual desire is \npredestined and unavoidable. In the absence of a clear controlling patriarchal figure \u2013 \nAarti's father, the only contender for this role, is deceived by his second wife and hence \npartially 'emasculated' \u2013 Raja, the hero, is identified as the locus of patriarchal and \n'traditional' values through his dialogues on propriety, dignity and nationalism. It is he \nwho polices his own sexuality at the beginning of the film17 and ultimately expresses \nthe director's belief in the popularity of patriarchal values when he says '[m]arriage in \nyour [rich, urban, westernised] society might be a game dissolved by a signature on a \npiece of paper but marriage in my [poor, rural, Indian] society is a religious bond of the \nheart \u2026 and cannot be broken even if we do not see each other for the rest of our lives'. \nHere, authoritarian attitudes sit comfortably astride a retrograde and self-righteous \nmoralism which passes, in various Hindi films, for 'tradition'. It would be fanciful to \ndeny that such statements contribute to already potent conservative discourses on \ngender and sexuality within Indian society. While it is clear from urban youth responses \nthat such film messages are neither cut and dried nor always passively accepted, it is \nvital to comprehend the profound impact of the wider cultural context on any \ninterpretation of Hindi films.   \n \nMost of the young people I interviewed in Bombay inhabit a precarious world bounded \nby economic and social barriers of various types. Although in some ways youth and \nparental taste might appear to be increasingly at odds18, many young film viewers from \n \n 25 \nboth working and middle-class backgrounds live with the knowledge that their control \nover choices about work, domicile and sexual or life partners is highly limited. At the \nsame time in the public sphere, along with the dominance in many states of rightwing \nHindu 'fundamentalist' politicians and ideologies, spaces within which young men and \nwomen might explore their identities or interact with each other are being policed in \nincreasingly hostile and violent ways19. Explorations of sex or sexual identity are at \nbest taboo; at worst they are distorted, demonised and destroyed. The widespread \nvilification of those who are deemed to have flouted 'public morality' creates a climate \nof repression and anxiety so intense that, in some instances, being seen speaking in \npublic to a member of the opposite sex is punishable in the most shocking ways20. In an \nenvironment such as the one currently in existence across vast areas of India, Hindi \nfilms may act to shore up dominant conservative morality, to warn of the dangers of \nnon-conformity and to encourage compliance with accepted gender behaviour; \nhowever, in addition, they can offer not only legitimate physical spaces for interaction, \ncontemplation or sexual exploration but also fantasy spaces for playful and\/or serious \nengagement with sexuality and other aspects of identity. Finally, then, readings of \nHindi films texts \u2013 such as the ones offered here \u2013 should not in any way be conceived \nas 'correct' or 'conclusive'. In fact, it is only by adequately exploring both the specific \nsociopolitical contexts and the multiple pleasures of Hindi commercial films that one \ncan begin to make sense of meanings their messages may have for the gender and \nsexual choices, attitudes and behaviour of young viewers.\n \n 26 \n \n                                                          \n1 See notably, Bharucha, 1995; Inden, 1999; Uberoi 1999 and 2001; Dwyer 2000. \n2 See Sara Dickey's discussion of the same phenomenon in Tamil cinema. (Dickey, 1993) \n3 Such a belief is expressed time and again both in 'classical' and popular fiction as well as media texts \nacross the globe.  Hollywood has a similar genre of teenage romances, some loosely based on \nShakespeare and others supposedly 'original'!   \n4 In her essay 'To Be a Woman' (1995) included in Aruna Vasudev's collection, Frames of Mind: \nReflections on Indian Cinema, Maithili Rao takes Mulvey's theory as given. \n5 Mulvey has critiqued her initial work for its exclusion of the female spectator's perspective, notably in \nthe essay, 'Afterthoughts on \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" inspired by King Vidor's Duel in \nthe Sun (1946)'; Mulvey, L. (1981) Frameworks 15-16-17, pp12-15.  \n6 Raja's first anger is incited by Aarti's commodification of his services to her when he is falling in love \nand wishing to give his labour as a gift.  It is only when he is able to pay her back the cash she gave him \nthat he can begin to regain his dignity and his view of himself as her equal.  He is also construed, through \nmonetary relations, as honest and incorruptible; Raja's disinterest in cash and his stubborn insistence on \nearning his keep is only another indication of his masculine virtue. \n7 See Lalitha Gopalan, (1997); Jyotika Virdi (1999) and Nikhat Kazmi (1998). \n8 'Listen to Your Heart and You Die' by Sakina Yusuf Khan, The Sunday Times of India, New Delhi, \nSeptember 2nd, 2001; 'Panchayat nod for murder?'

The Hindu, August 22nd, 2001. \n9 Such comments are mild versions of the ones that are in currency in most urban centres in India: my \nfemale interviewees spoke of constant references to their breasts and bottoms, often invoking their cow-\nlike milk-giving properties; they explained that whatever they wore, they were subjected to such (or \nmuch worse physical) harassment which made them feel degraded and dirty. (Audience research, \nBombay: 2000-2001) \n10 Emphasis mine \u2013 the word 'thing' appears to speak for itself in a debate about objectification!  Whereas \nit was used in the original song as a bestowal of praise \u2013 you gorgeous thing \u2013 its sinister possibilities are \nmyriad and Darmesh Darshan uses them, bizarrely enough, to point to the dangerous 'effects' that film \nlyrics supposedly have on the lumpen elements in society.   \n11 Nadeem Shravan's sound-track was tremendously successful, emphasising the position of music in \nmaking a film popular, just as the visuals of nature scenes are common-places of romantic Hindi cinema. \n12 Dern\u00e9 too calls it the 'longest kiss in Hindi movie history' (2000: 131) \n13 Rediff On the NeT, Movies: The Darmesh Darshan Interview, 2000 \n14 11th Feb 2001, Internet Movie Database, user comments. \n15 In the 1989 Sooraj Barjatya romance Maine Pyaar Kiya, the heroine is never reveals her body to the \ncamera and in only one scene is she supposedly revealed to her lover, Prem.  Similarly, in the 1995 \nAditya Chopra film Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Kajol remains a whole night in the fields with her \nlover but we are never shown what happens; she remains covered throughout the film.  However, many \nwet scenes in Hindi films eschew subtlety in favour of a buttock-wobbling, hip swinging dance routine \nthat shows off the heroine's 'assets' from every available angle.  \n16 This theme is amply explored by Hindi films, for instance in Jab Jab Phool Khile (1965) \n17 As does Shah Rukh Khan, Aditya Chopra's hero in the 1995 hit Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge (The \nOne with the Heart Wins the Bride), when he spends a night with the drunk heroine without molesting \nher. \n18 MTV, Channel V and several other satellite stations beam increasingly risqu\u00e9 scenes and topics into \nmiddle-class households. \n19 See 'Courting Death' by Vijaya Pushkarna September 9 2001, The Week: India Cover Story \n20 One 18 year-old interviewee told how she was beaten and put under 'house arrest' for a month by her \nparents for being seen speaking to a neighbour's son outside the local temple.
