GrlA is a LEE-encoded transcription regulator that has been proposed to be \ninvolved in the regulation of expression of the LEE1 operon. We describe a simple \nplasmid-based system to investigate the LEE1 operon regulatory region and to study \nGrlA-dependent effects. We report that GrlA can activate transcription initiation at the \nLEE1 P1 promoter by binding to a target located within the 18 base pair spacer between \nthe promoter -10 and -35 elements, which were defined by mutational analysis. \nShortening this spacer to 17 base pairs increases P1 promoter activity and short-circuits \nGrlA-dependent activation. Hence, at the P1 promoter, the action of GrlA resembles \nthat of many MerR family transcription activators at their target promoters.  \n \n \nIntroduction \nEnterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O157:H7 causes haemorrhagic colitis \nand haemolytic uremic syndrome in humans, exploiting virulence determinants that include a \ntype III secretion system. Effector molecules are translocated through the type III secretion \nsystem, and this causes the formation of attaching and effacing lesions in intestinal epithelial \ncells (Nataro and Kaper, 1998; Bhavsar et al., 2007). The genes responsible for this \nphenotype are contained in a pathogenicity island termed the locus of enterocyte effacement \n(LEE) (McDaniel et al., 1995; Perna et al., 1998). The LEE genes are shared by many \nbacterial strains including enteropathogenic E. coli (Elliott et al., 1998) and Citrobacter \nrodentium (Schauer and Falkow, 1993). The LEE contains approximately 40 protein coding \nsequences that are transcribed in five major polycistronic operons (designated LEE1-5) and \nseveral smaller transcriptional units (Mellies et al., 1999). LEE gene expression is controlled \nby a complex network of signals and transcription factors (reviewed by Mellies et al., 2007; \nTree et al., 2009). The \u201emaster\u201f regulator of the system is the Ler protein (the LEE-encoded \nregulator encoded by the ler gene) that acts as the central activator for expression of most of \nthe LEE genes (Mellies et al., 1999; Bustamante et al., 2001; Umanski et al., 2002; Haack et \nal., 2003; Stoebel et al., 2008).  \n \nThe ler gene is the first cistron of the LEE1 operon, and the LEE1 regulatory region, located \nimmediately upstream, is crucial in controlling expression of the LEE. In EHEC, this region \n3 \n \nhas been reported to contain two promoters, P1 and P2, respectively distal and proximal with \nrespect to the ler translation start site (Figure 1) (Sperandio et al., 2002). Expression from the \nLEE1 regulatory region is controlled directly or indirectly by a multitude of regulators, \nincluding IHF, Fis, H-NS, QseA, BipA GadX, Pch, DksA, Hha, EtrA, EivF and small RNAs \ntogether with Ler itself (Mellies et al., 2007; Tree et al., 2009; Hansen and Kaper, 2009; a \nrecent overview summary can be found in the introduction to Kendall et al., 2010). In \naddition, GrlR and GrlA, encoded by a bicistronic operon grlRA located within the LEE, \nbetween the LEE1 and the LEE2 operons (Figure 1), appear to play a role (Deng et al., 2004; \nBarba et al., 2005; Jimenez et al., 2010). GrlA (global regulator of LEE activator) is a \ntranscription activator, whilst GrlR (global regulator of LEE repressor) acts as a repressor by \nbinding to GrlA and preventing its activity (Jobichen et al., 2007). GrlA is homologous to the \nenterobacterial CaiF proteins (Mellies et al., 2007), which positively regulate expression of \nthe carnitine pathway (Buchet et al., 1999), and a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif has \nbeen predicted (Deng et al., 2004). \n \nMany aspects of the action of GrlA at the EHEC LEE1 regulatory region are still open to \nquestion. For example, both Huang and Syu (2008) and Jimenez et al. (2010) reported that \npurified GrlA fusion proteins could bind to the LEE1 regulatory region but did not define its \nbinding target, whilst Russell et al. (2007) suggested that GrlA may modulate LEE1 \nexpression via the action of another factor. Hence our aim in this work was to improve our \nunderstanding of the action of GrlA at the EHEC LEE1 regulatory region. In our previous \nwork with very complex bacterial promoters we had noted that individual regulatory \ncomponents were often able to function in isolation (Barnard et al., 2004) and, thus, we chose \nto use a laboratory strain of E. coli K-12 as a \u201etest-tube\u201f to reconstruct GrlA-dependent \nactivation at the LEE1 regulatory region. We have exploited this background to investigate \nthe activity of the P1 and P2 promoters, to find the target for GrlA-dependent activation at the \nP1 promoter, and to identify functional determinants in GrlA.  \n \nAt most E. coli promoters, the key sequences required for activity are the -10 and -35 \nhexamer elements, which are recognised by different domains of the RNA polymerase \u03c3 \nfactor, and the optimal length of the spacer region between these elements is 17 base pairs \n(McClure, 1985). Most transcription activators function by binding to targets located \nupstream from or overlapping with the -35 element (Browning and Busby, 2004). Here we \nreport that the functional -10 and -35 elements at the LEE1 regulatory region P1 promoter are \n4 \n \nseparated by a non-optimal 18 base pair spacer and that GrlA activates expression from P1 by \nbinding to a target within this spacer. \n \nResults  \nActivity of the LEE1 promoters and nested deletion analysis \nThe regulatory region of the E. coli O157:H7 LEE1 operon is located upstream from the ler \ngene. Thus, the start point of this work was to create a construct in which lacZ expression is \ncontrolled by the LEE10-568 fragment, which carries the base sequence from position -568 to \nposition -19 upstream of the functional ATG start codon of the ler gene (Figure 1). Figure 2A \nillustrates a series of eight nested deletions of this fragment, showing the location of the \nupstream end of each fragment with respect to the two proposed LEE1 promoters, P1 and P2. \nEach fragment was cloned into the lac expression vector, pRW224, and the resulting \nrecombinants were transformed into the \u0394lac E. coli K-12 laboratory strain, M182, and into \ntwo EHEC serotype O157:H7 strains (Sakai and EDL933). Measurements of \u03b2-galactosidase \nexpression illustrated in Figure 2B show the effects of the deletions on the activity of the \nLEE1 promoters. The overall patterns of activity in all three E. coli strains resemble each \nother in both LB medium and DMEM medium (see supplementary material, Figure S2). \nExpression increases ~2-4 fold as upstream sequences are removed and optimal expression is \nfound with the LE10-275 and LEE10-215 fragments, that carry DNA sequence up to positions \n-275 and -215 upstream from the ler start codon. Longer deletions to positions -203, -195 \nand -155 result in a large decrease in expression. Since the region from positions -215 to -155 \ncontains the proposed sequence elements for the P1 promoter (Sperandio et al., 2002), we \nconclude that, in our conditions, P1 is the major functional promoter for the LEE1 operon. \nWith the LEE10-155 and LEE10-115 fragments, which lack all P1 elements, expression is 10-\n15% of the maximum. This expression is most likely due to the P2 promoter, since the longer \ndeletion in the LEE10-75 fragment, which cuts into P2, causes a reduction in expression to \nbasal levels. \n \nIn a complementary experiment, the LEE10-568, LEE10-315, LEE10-275 and LEE10-203 \nfragments were shortened to move the downstream HindIII site to position -158, rather than \nposition -19, thereby deleting the downstream P2 promoter, and generating the LEE20-568, \nLEE20-315, LEE20-275 and LEE20-203 fragments (Figure 2A). After cloning these \nfragments into pRW224, the observed patterns of \u03b2-galactosidase expression in both the \nO157:H7 and M182 strains were similar to with the LEE10 fragment series (Figure 2B). The \n5 \n \ndata are consistent with the conclusion that the P2 promoter makes but a minor contribution to \nthe activity measured here. Note that the increased expression seen with the LEE20 fragments \nis probably due to the shorter untranslated leader sequence upstream of the reporter lacZ gene.  \n \nIdentification of functional elements at the LEE1 regulatory region P1 promoter \nIn the experiment illustrated in Figure 2, the shortest fragment that shows maximum promoter \nactivity is the LEE20-275 fragment. This fragment carries the DNA sequence from \npositions -275 to -158 upstream of the ler start codon and includes the P1 promoter. The \ncomplete sequence of this fragment is shown in Figure 3, where the sequence has been \nrenumbered 1-118, starting immediately downstream of the EcoRI linker. We adopted this \nsimpler numbering system to describe the ensuing mutational analysis of the LEE20-275 \nfragment and the shorter LEE20-203 fragment.  \n \nTo identify elements essential for promoter activity, error-prone PCR was used to generate ten \nindependent preparations of the LEE20-275 fragment carrying random point mutations. The \nfragments were then cloned into the pRW224 lac reporter plasmid, the resulting recombinant \nplasmids were transformed into E. coli strain M182, and transformants were grown on \nMacConkey indicator plates. As expected, the majority of colonies scored as Lac\n+\n (red), but, \nafter screening over 100,000 transformants, we identified ~100 Lac\n-\n (pale pink) colonies. \nSequence analysis showed that 43 of these carried single mutations in the LEE20-275 \nfragment cloned in pRW224.  \n \nThe locations of the different single point mutations that reduced lac expression from the \nLEE20-275 promoter fragment are illustrated in Figure 3. Strikingly, 25 of the 43 point \nmutations fall in the TTGACA motif at positions 73-77 that was predicted by Sperandio et al. \n(2002) to be the LEE1 P1 promoter -35 hexamer, and which corresponds exactly to the \nconsensus hexamer -35 element for E. coli promoters. The effects of the different \nsubstitutions in this element were quantified and the data are shown in Table 1. The results \nare consistent with this being the functional -35 element controlling expression from the \nLEE20-275 fragment. Another of the point mutations (71A) falls just upstream of the -35 \nelement, and its effects are consistent with the lower promoter activity of the LEE20-203 \nfragment compared to the LEE20-275 fragment (Figure 2B). \n \n6 \n \nA second cluster accounts for 15 of the 43 point mutations and appears to identify the \npromoter -10 hexamer (Figure 3). Recall that base pairs at positions 1 and 2 of promoter -10 \nhexamers in E. coli are most crucial for promoter activity (McClure, 1985), so this suggests \nthat the motif TACACA at positions 97-102 is the likely functional -10 hexamer element. \nSince the consensus -10 element for E. coli promoters is TATAAT, we used site-directed \nmutagenesis to create complementary mutations to check this suggestion. Data presented in \nTable 1 show that the 97C, 98C, 98G, 98T and 100G substitutions cause >90% reductions in \nexpression, whilst the 99A, 99G, 101G, 102C and 102G substitutions have lesser effects. \nThese results are consistent with our assignation of TACACA as the -10 element. However, \nthis would mean that the spacer between the proposed -35 and -10 hexamer elements is 18 \nbase pairs rather than the optimal 17 base pairs. We therefore constructed a LEE20-275 \nfragment derivative in which a T in the spacer was deleted (\u039494T), thus shortening the spacer \nto the optimal 17 base pairs. Data presented in Table 1 show that the measured promoter \nactivity is doubled by the \u039494T mutation. Note that one of the Lac- mutants, selected after \nrandom mutagenesis, carried the LEE20-275 fragment with an extra T between position 93 \nand 94. This insertion extended the spacer to 19 base pairs, and caused a sharp reduction in \nlac expression (Table 1), suggesting that P1 promoter activity tails off as the spacer length \nincreases from the optimal 17 base pairs. \n \nTo confirm the location of the functional promoter in the LEE20-275 fragment, we studied \ncomplexes between purified DNA fragments and purified E. coli RNA polymerase \nholoenzyme. In these experiments, we compared the starting \u201ewild-type\u201f DNA fragment with \na corresponding fragment carrying the 98C substitution at position 2 of the -10 hexamer \nelement. An experiment in which binary RNA polymerase-DNA complexes were probed with \npotassium permanganate, a reagent that modifies T residues in the single stranded \u201ebubble\u201f \nproduced after local unwinding of promoter DNA around the transcription start, is illustrated \nin Figure 4 (Savery et al., 1996; Browning et al., 2009). The experiment reveals extensive \nunwinding just downstream of the promoter -10 hexamer and, crucially, this unwinding is \ngreatly reduced with the 98C mutant. We then analysed the labelled transcripts formed after \nlabelled nucleoside triphosphates were added to the binary complexes. In this experiment, \nRNA polymerase runs to a terminator in the DNA fragment synthesising labelled RNA \nmolecules that are detected by gel electrophoresis (Figure 4B). The major transcript starting in \nthe LEE20-275 fragment is ~102 bases and this corresponds to a transcript starting at position \n7 \n \n107A, 5 bases downstream from the proposed -10 element (Figure 3). This RNA species is \ncompletely absent when the DNA fragment carrying the 98C substitution is used (Figure 4B). \n \nActivation by GrlA \nA major aim of this study was to investigate the action of GrlA at the LEE1 operon regulatory \nregion. To do this, we used a series of pACYC184 derivatives carrying the grlRA operon \n(pSI01), grlA alone (pSI02), grlR alone (pSI03) or empty vector (Figure 1), pRW224 \nderivatives carrying different LEE1 regulatory region fragments (Figure 2), and the E. coli \nK-12 M182 \u0394lac strain as a \u201etest tube\u201f. In a preliminary experiment, M182 was \nco-transformed with pRW224 carrying the LEE10-568 fragment and the different pACYC184 \nderivatives, and \u03b2-galactosidase expression was measured. The results show ~6-fold \nactivation in the presence of GrlA (Figure 5). As expected (Jobichen et al., 2007), the \nactivation found with GrlA alone (pSI02) was suppressed by the presence of GrlR (pSI01).  \n \nGrlA-dependent activation at the LEE1 regulatory region carried by fragments with the two \nseries of nested deletions described earlier (Figure 2) was measured. Activation is observed \nwith the LEE20 series of fragments that lack the P2 promoter, but is lost with the LEE10-195, \nLEE10-155, LEE10-115 and LEE10-75 fragments in which segments of the P1 promoter are \ndeleted (Figure 6). From this, we deduce that the LEE1 P1 promoter is the target for activation \nby GrlA, and this can be measured even with the 52 base pair LEE20-203 fragment. Note that \nGrlA-dependent activation at the LEE1 P1 promoter carried by LEE20-203 fragment can also \nbe measured in the Sakai EHEC serotype O157:H7 strain (see supplementary material, Figure \nS3). \n \nJimenez et al. (2010) recently reported that GrlA primarily activates LEE1 expression by \ncounteracting repression by the global repressor, H-NS, but also reported GrlA-dependent \nactivation of LEE1 in the absence of H-NS. To investigate this, we measured expression from \nthe  LEE1 regulatory region and activation by GrlA in E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 and its \nisogenic hns derivative.  With the full-length LEE10-568 fragment, LEE1 promoter activity \nis clearly repressed by H-NS, and, as expected, the repression is overcome by GrlA which \nactivates to higher levels in both the hns\n+\n and hns backgrounds (Figure 7). In contrast, with \nthe short LEE20-203 fragment, LEE1 promoter activity is not repressed by H-NS and a \nsimilar level of GrlA-dependent activation is observed in both genetic backgrounds. Hence, \nGrlA can activate the LEE1 P1 promoter independently of H-NS. \n8 \n \n \nEvidence that GrlA binds to the spacer region at the LEE1 P1 promoter \nMost bacterial transcription activators function by binding to specific sites upstream of \nthe -35 hexamer at target promoters (Browning and Busby, 2004). However, this cannot be \nthe case for GrlA at the LEE1 P1 promoter since GrlA-dependent activation was observed \nwith both the LEE10-203 and LEE20-203 fragments, which begin immediately upstream of \nthe -35 TTGACA hexamer element (Figure 8A). To identify essential promoter determinants \nfor activation, we constructed a series of mutations throughout the LEE20-203 fragment and \nmeasured GrlA-dependent activation. The effects of 23 point mutations throughout this \nfragment, which carries only 46 base pairs of the LEE1 regulatory region sequence, were \nmeasured. The results (Figure 8) show that GrlA-dependent activation is completely \nsuppressed by the 89G, 90C, 91C, 92A and 98C substitutions (note that the numbering is as in \nFigure 3 and Table 1). As noted, the 98C substitution falls at the second position of the -10 \nhexamer and completely knocks out P1 activity (Figure 4). In contrast, positions 89-92 fall \nwithin the 18 base pair promoter spacer region. A simple explanation for the effects of \nchanges at these positions would be that they fall within the binding site for GrlA and hence \nsuppress GrlA binding and ensuing activation.  \n \nIn a complementary set of experiments, effects of altering the length of the spacer length on \nGrlA-dependent activation at the LEE1 P1 promoter were measured, using derivatives of the \nLEE20-203 fragment carrying insertions or deletions in the spacer either upstream or \ndownstream of, but not within positions 89-92. The results, presented in Table 2, show that \nGrlA-independent expression from the LEE20-203 fragment is increased by single base \ndeletions at positions 79 or 94, but decreased by two-base deletions at positions 79 and 80, or \nby single base insertions between positions 78 and 79 or between positions 93 and 94. Hence, \nas expected, in the absence of GrlA, optimal LEE1 P1 activity is found with a 17 base pair \nspacer. However, GrlA-dependent activation of the LEE1 P1 promoter is found only with the \nstarting 18 base pair non-optimal spacer, and it is suppressed by all of the deletions and \ninsertions that were tested. Note that, in this experiment, we selected locations for insertions \nand deletions that did not appear to be involved in GrlA binding. \n \nWe sought to use the well-established in vitro band shift and footprinting techniques (Minchin \nand Busby, 2009) to identify the binding target for GrlA at the LEE1 P1 promoter. However \nour efforts were unsuccessful as we failed to purify soluble functional GrlA. Thus, we turned \n9 \n \nto genetic approaches and, first, used suppression genetics. Error-prone PCR was used to \ncreate random mutations in the grlA coding sequence within pSI02. Mutated pSI02 DNA was \nthen transformed into E. coli strain M182 containing pRW224 carrying the LEE20-203 \nfragment with the 92A substitution that reduces lac expression (Figure 8), resulting in Lac\n-\n \ncolonies on MacConkey indicator plates. After screening over 75,000 transformants, from 10 \nindependent preparations of mutated pSI02, we identified 11 Lac\n+\n colonies containing pSI02 \nwith single-base substitutions leading to the RK53, IT59 or IV59 substitutions in GrlA. These \nsubstitutions fall in the predicted helix-turn-helix motif of GrlA (Figure 9A). We found that \nthe RK53, IT59 and IV59 substitutions partially restore GrlA-dependent activation with the \nLEE20-203 fragment carrying the 92A mutation but not with other mutations (Figure 9B). \nThis implies that, when bound at the LEE1 P1 promoter, residues 53 and 59 may be \nsufficiently close to make contact with the base pair at position 92 and suggests that the \npredicted helix-turn-helix in GrlA is functional in binding the target operator site. To \ninvestigate this further, a set of pSI02 derivatives encoding GrlA with alanine substitutions at \nsequential residues from L52 to S63 was constructed and GrlA-dependent activation of \nexpression from the starting and mutant LEE20-203 fragments was measured. We found that \nthe RA54 substitution causes the largest activation defect (Figure 10A). Taken together with \nthe suppression genetics experiment, this suggests that the R54 side chain makes a contact \nwith the GrlA binding target somewhere in its target from positions 89 to 92, and that the \nRK53 substitution in the neighbouring side chain makes a contact that compensates for the \n92A substitution.  \n \nIn a complementary experiment, we investigated whether any of the alanine substitutions \ncould relieve the \u201edown\u201f effects of specific base substitutions in the putative GrlA operator \ntarget in the LEE20-203 promoter fragment. Results in panels B and C of Figure 10 show that \nthe FA57 substitution partially reverses the effects of the 89G and 90C substitutions. The \nsimplest explanation is that residue F57 clashes with the base pairs at positions 89-90 in the \nmutated LEE20-203 89G or 90C fragments, probably because residue F57 is close to \npositions 89 and 90 in the GrlA-target DNA complex. A similar relationship was found \nbetween residue R53 and position 91 (Figure 10D).  \n \nDiscussion \nIn pathogenic E. coli and related bacteria, the LEE plays a key role during infection and the \nexpression of the different LEE genes must be carefully orchestrated in time and space. This \n10 \n \nis likely to account for the complexity of LEE1 regulation. Here, we have focussed on one \nsingle aspect, namely activation by GrlA, and studied it in the context of a simplified system, \nusing a non-pathogenic E. coli K-12 strain as a host.   \n \nThe first issue that we addressed was the relative activity of the two promoters, P1 and P2. \nOur conclusion, that P1 is the major promoter is in agreement with Porter et al. (2005). Other \ngroups have reported a bigger role for P2 (e.g., Sperandio et al., 2002; Sharp and Sperandio, \n2007) but differences are likely due to the precise fusions, genetic backgrounds and \nconditions used for the measurements. These differences underscore the point that any set of \nresults applies only to the conditions in which the experiments are performed. Our \nexperimental setup allowed us to make a detailed mutational analysis of the key P1 elements \n(Figure 3 and Table 1) and this identified TTGACA and TACACA as the functional -35 \nand -10 hexamer elements, respectively. The -35 element, which was predicted by Sperandio \net al. (2002) and other groups, corresponds exactly to the established consensus for E. coli \npromoters (McClure, 1985). The -10 element was originally identified by Sperandio et al. \n(2002) as TACACA but, due to uncertainty in the location of the P1 transcript start, was later \nreassigned to a sequence 2 base pairs upstream, TTTACA (Porter et al., 2005; Russell et al., \n2007; Sharp and Sperandio, 2007). Our mutational analysis argues unambiguously for \nTACACA, as originally assigned, and a key consequence of this is that the spacer region \nbetween the -10 and -35 elements is 18 base pairs, one above the optimal 17 base pairs for \npromoter activity (McClure, 1985). An important point to note is that there is considerable \nflexibility in the location of the 5\u201f end of transcripts with respect to -10 hexamer regions at \nbacterial promoters and the structural basis for this is now understood (Darst, 2009). Indeed, \nthe AT-rich nature downstream of the -10 element may confer unusual flexibility at the LEE1 \nP1 promoter and this may be reflected in the greater than usual unwinding (>20 base pairs) \nseen in the open complex probed by permanganate (Figure 4A; compare with Browning et al., \n2009). The consequence of this is that the different start points reported in different \nexperiments could all be correct. For many bacterial promoters, the upstream end of the -10 \nhexamer provides the major anchoring point for RNA polymerase and the location of the first \ntemplated base is not fixed (Sclavi, 2009). For this reason, rather than referencing LEE1 P1 \npromoter locations with the transcript start as +1, we used an arbitrary numbering system \nfrom an upstream fixed point to describe our experiments (Figure 3). \n \n11 \n \nMost summaries of transcriptional regulation in the LEE (e.g. Kendall et al., 2010) show \nGrlA as a positive regulator of expression from the LEE1 regulatory region and yet the \ncurrent literature is not completely unambiguous. We were able to show significant activation \nat LEE1 by GrlA in our K-12 system (Figure 5) and this activation was suppressed by GrlR, \nwhich suggests that our set-up is reporting physiologically relevant effects. Our most striking \nobservations were GrlA-dependent activation from a 52-base pair promoter fragment \n(LEE20-203) that lacks LEE1 sequence upstream of the P1 -35 hexamer, and the localisation \nof the DNA target for GrlA to the spacer region between the P1 -10 and -35 hexamer \nelements. In agreement with Jimenez et al. (2010), our results (Figure 7) confirm that GrlA \nplays a dual role at the LEE1 regulatory region by counteracting repression by the global \nrepressor, H-NS, and activating the P1 promoter. Our observation that expression from the \n52-base pair LEE20-203 promoter fragment is activated by GrlA, but not subject to repression \nby H-NS, argues that GrlA can function as a true transcription activator, most likely by \ndirectly accelerating one of the transactions between RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the \nLEE1 P1 promoter.  \n \nTo date, it has proven impossible to reconstitute GrlA-dependent transcription activation at \nthe LEE1 regulatory region in vitro. Indeed, we were unable to purify functional GrlA, in \norder to reproduce the in vitro binding reported by Huang and Syu (2008) and Jimenez et al. \n(2010). However, we were able to exploit different genetic approaches to confirm the \nproposed DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif in GrlA, and to identify its target in the spacer \nregion. Our conclusion that GrlA binds to the LEE1 P1 promoter spacer region was surprising, \nsince most bacterial transcription activators bind sites that are upstream of or overlapping \nthe -35 element of the target promoter (Browning and Busby, 2004). However several \nmembers of the MerR family of transcription factors provide interesting exceptions to this \nrule since they also bind to sites located between the -10 and -35 hexamers at target promoters \n(reviewed by Brown et al., 2003). Furthermore, they activate transcription at target promoters \nwhere the spacing between the -10 and -35 hexamer elements is greater than the optimum 17 \nbase pairs. Current models for activation by MerR family members suggest that their binding \nin the spacer bends or twists the target DNA, resulting in juxtaposition of the target \npromoter -10 and -35 elements that facilitates RNA polymerase binding (reviewed by Brown \net al., 2003). The existence of an 18 base pair spacer in the LEE1 P1 promoter, which, when \nchanged to 17 base pairs, increases promoter activity and stops GrlA-dependent activation, \nargues that a similar activation mechanism may be occurring here (Figure 11), even though \n12 \n \nthere is no significant sequence similarity between GrlA and any member of the MerR family. \nNote that our conclusions are consistent with Jimenez et al (2010) who reported that the DNA \nsite for GrlA is downstream of position -54 at its target promoter in the LEE1 regulatory \nregion of enteropathogenic E. coli. \n \nIn conclusion, it is clear that the interaction between GrlA and the LEE1 P1 promoter \nrepresents an intriguing case study in the complexity of bacterial gene regulation, of interest, \nnot just to researchers studying bacterial pathogenesis, but also to those interested in promoter \norganisation. Further insights into the action of GrlA may emerge from studying its other \ntargets and its interactions with other proteins. To date, the full extent of the GrlA regulon is \nunknown, though it has been reported to activate the expression of the Ehx enterohemolysin \n(Saitoh et al., 2008) and repress genes responsible for the formation of flagella (Iyoda et al., \n2006).  \n \nExperimental procedures \nStrains, plasmids and oligonucleotides \nIn this work we used E. coli K-12 strain M182 (Casadaban, 1976), MG1655 and a hns \nderivative (Grainger et al., 2008), and two EHEC O157:H7 strains lacking the stx toxin, Sakai \n813, obtained from Chihiro Sasakawa and EDL933, given by Arthur Donohue-Rolfe. The \nvector plasmids used were pRW224 (Lodge et al., 1992), pSR (Kolb et al., 1995) and \npACYC184 (Chang and Cohen, 1978). Plasmid pRW224 is an RK2-based low copy number \nlac expression vector, encoding resistance to tetracycline, designed to facilitate the cloning of \nEcoRI-HindIII fragments carrying a promoter directed towards the HindIII end of the \nfragment but without a translation start. Thus, a translation initiation signal for lacZ is located \nin the vector immediately adjacent to the HindIII site as described by Bingham and Busby \n(1987) and supplementary Figure S1. Plasmid pSR is a colE1-based general cloning vector, \nencoding resistance to ampicillin. Promoters that are cloned into pSR on EcoRI-HindIII \nfragments run into the bacteriophage \u03bb oop terminator downstream of the HindIII site \n(Browning et al., 2009). Plasmid pACYC184 is a P15A-based general cloning vector, \nencoding resistance to tetracycline and chloroamphenicol. We routinely cloned DNA \nsegments so as to disrupt resistance to tetracycline. Hence, for use as an empty vector, we \nconstructed the pACYC184\u0394HN derivative by deleting intervening sequences between the \nHindIII and NruI sites. This derivative encodes resistance to chloramphenicol but not to \ntetracycline. Standard techniques for recombinant DNA manipulations were used throughout \n13 \n \nthis work using PCR with synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide primers made by Alta \nBiosciences (University of Birmingham) that are listed in the supplementary material (Table \nS1). All cloned sequences were checked using the University of Birmingham Functional \nGenomics Facility (http:\/\/www.genomics.bham.ac.uk\/sequencing.htm). \n \nCloning of LEE1 regulatory region fragments and mutational analysis \nPCR was used to amplify the LEE10-568 fragment using the D61221 and D61222 oligos and \ngenomic DNA from the O157:H7 Sakai 813 strain. The fragment was designed with flanking \nEcoRI and HindIII sites respectively located upstream and downstream of the LEE1 \nregulatory region, with the HindIII site positioned such that the fragment excluded the ler \ngene Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Figure 1). The resulting product was restricted with EcoRI \nand HindIII and cloned into pRW224. The different fragments in the LEE10 and LEE20 sets \nof nested deletions, illustrated in Figure 2, were made using primers listed in the \nsupplementary material (Table S1). Each fragment is described by the location of its upstream \nend, in terms of the number of bases upstream from the functional ler ATG codon defined by \nYerushalmi et al. (2008). Different mutations were introduced into the LEE20-275 and \nLEE20-203 fragments cloned in pRW224 by using error prone PCR (Leung et al., 1989) with \nflanking primers D10520 and D53463, or by using megaprimer PCR (Perrin and Gilliland, \n1990) as in Chismon et al. (2010). The different bases at the LEE1 P1 promoter in the \nLEE20-275 fragment are numbered 1-118, as shown in Figure 3. We used this numbering \nsystem to describe different P1 promoter mutations, in both the LEE20-275 and LEE20-203 \nfragments. Note that we did not adopt the customary convention of numbering bases with \nrespect to the transcript start point because of uncertainty about its location. \n \nCloning of grlRA and mutational analysis \nPCR was used to amplify a HindIII-SalI fragment carrying the grlRA operon using the \nD62895 and D62897 oligos and genomic DNA from the O157:H7 Sakai 813 strain. The \nresulting product was restricted with HindIII and SalI and cloned into pACYC184 to give \npSI01. To construct pSI02, which is a derivative of pSI01 carrying a large in-frame deletion \nin grlR, we used PCR with primers D63209 and D63210 and pSI01 as a template. The \nresulting product was cut with BamHI and circularised by ligation to give pSI02. To construct \npSI03, which is a derivative of pSI01 deleted for grlA, we used primers D62895 and D63698 \nand pSI01 as a template. The resulting product was restricted with HindIII and SalI and \ncloned into pACYC184 to give pSI03.  Different mutations were introduced into pSI02 by \n14 \n \nusing error prone PCR (Leung et al., 1989) with flanking primers D63048 and D63049, or by \nusing megaprimer PCR (Perrin and Gilliland, 1990). \n \n-Galactosidase assays \nTo assay promoter activity in the LEE1 regulatory region we used the different LEE10 and \nLEE20 fragments (Figure 2) cloned in pRW224. E. coli strains carrying different pRW224 \nrecombinants were grown aerobically with shaking at 37\u00b0C in LB medium or Dulbecco\u201fs \nmodified Eagle\u201fs medium (DMEM) containing 35 g ml-1 tetracycline. In experiments to \nmeasure the effects of grlR and grlA, encoded by pACYC184 derivatives, 35 g ml\n-1\n \nchloramphenicol was also included. -galactosidase levels were measured by the Miller (1972) \nmethod. Recorded activities are shown in Miller units and are the average of at least three \nindependent experiments.  \n \nPermanganate footprinting and run-off transcription assays \nPurified PstI\u2013BamHI DNA fragments were derived from caesium chloride preparations of \nplasmid pSR carrying the LEE20-275 fragment. Fragments were labelled at the BamHI end \nusing [\u03b3-32P]-ATP and polynucleotide kinase. Permanganate footprints were performed \nfollowing the protocol of Savery et al. (1996) using holo E. coli RNA polymerase, which was \npurchased from Epicenter (Madison). Each reaction contained approximately 3 nM labelled \nDNA fragment in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 1 mM \nDTT and 0.5 mg ml\n-1 \nBSA and 50 nM holo RNA polymerase as required. Products of \nfootprinting reactions were analysed on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels, \ncalibrated with Maxam Gilbert \u201cG+A\u201d sequencing reactions.   \n \nThe in vitro transcription experiments were performed as described by Browning et al. (2009) \nusing PstI\u2013BamHI DNA fragments purified from caesium chloride preparations of pSR \ncarrying the LEE20-275 fragment. These fragments served as a template for multiple round in \nvitro transcription assays in which 20 ng fragment was incubated in transcription buffer \ncontaining 40 mM Tris pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM KCl, 100 \u00b5g ml\n-1 \nbovine \nserum albumin, 200 \u00b5M GTP, 200 \u00b5M ATP, 200 \u00b5M CTP, 10 \u00b5M UTP and 5 \u00b5Ci [\n32\nP]-\nUTP. Reactions were started by adding holo E. coli RNA polymerase purchased from \nEpicenter (Madison). RNA products were analysed on a denaturing 5.5 % polyacrylamide gel \n15 \n \nand visualised using a Fuji phosphor screen and BioRad Molecular Imager FX. Gels were \ncalibrated with Maxam Gilbert \u201cG+A\u201d sequencing reactions.  \n \nHelix-turn-helix prediction for GrlA \nThe DNA-binding helix-turn-helix of GrlA, suggested by Deng et al. (2004), was confirmed \ncomputationally by the Dodd and Egan (1990) method, http:\/\/npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr\/cgi-\nbin\/npsa_automat.pl?page=\/NPSA\/npsa_hth.html, the GYM2.0 method, \nhttp:\/\/users.cis.fiu.edu\/~giri\/bioinf\/GYM2\/prog.html (Narasimhan et al., 2002), and the Jpred \nstructure prediction tool, http:\/\/www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk\/www-jpred\/index.html (Cole et \nal., 2008). \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by a BBSRC project grant and by a Commonwealth PhD \nstudentship to M.S.I.

Schematic representation of the LEE region. \nThe upper line shows the organisation of the different LEE transcription units. The lower left \npart of the figure shows an expanded sketch of the LEE1 regulatory region and illustrates the \nLEE10-568 fragment and how it was cloned into the pRW224 lac expression vector. The \nlocations of the two LEE1 regulatory region promoters P1 and P2 are indicated, together with \nthe translation initiation region (TIR that contains the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the \ntranslation initiation codon, see supplementary Figure S1). The lower right part of the figure \nshows an expanded sketch of the grlRA transcription unit and illustrates how it was cloned \ninto vector plasmid pACYC184 to give pSI01, together with two deletion derivatives to give \npSI02 and pSI03. E, H, B and S indicate the location of the EcoRI, HindIII, BamHI and SalI \nsites that were used in cloning (see experimental procedures). \n \nFig. 2. Nested deletions of the LEE1 regulatory region.  \nA. Schematic representation of a set of EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragments covering the LEE1 \nregulatory region. The coordinates of the upstream and downstream end of each fragment \nrefer to the number of base pairs upstream from the functional ATG start codon of the ler \ngene reported by Yerushalmi et al. (2008). The P1 and P2 promoters are indicated by bent \narrows and the shaded black boxes represent the cognate -10 and -35 hexamer elements.   \nB. Bar chart to illustrate measured \u03b2-galactosidase activities in E. coli K-12, EHEC Sakai and \nEHEC EDL933 cells carrying pRW224 with each of the different fragments. Vector refers to \nempty pRW224 with a short linker between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. Activities were \nmeasured after growing the cells in LB medium to an optical density at 650 nm of ~0.5 at \n37\u00b0C. The values are the average of three independent assays. Standard errors are shown with \nerror bars. \n \nFig. 3. Mutational analysis of the LEE20-275 fragment.  \nThe figure shows the nucleotide sequence of the upper strand of LEE20-275 fragment. The \nbase sequences are numbered 1-118, starting with the first cloned LEE1 regulatory region \nbase (that is 275 base pairs upstream from the ler translation start codon). The positions of \nrandomly generated single mutations that reduced expression from this fragment are \nillustrated by showing the substituted base and, in each case, the adjacent number records the \nnumber of times that the particular substitution was obtained. The locations of the P1 \npromoter -35 and -10 hexamer elements, deduced from this study, are shown by grey shading \n22 \n \nand the transcript start, at position 107A, determined from data in Figure 4B is indicated. The \nupstream end of the smaller LEE20-203 fragment is indicated by a bent solid\/dotted line. \n \nFig. 4. In vitro permanganate footprinting and transcription assays. \nA. The figure shows an autoradiogram that identifies the potassium permanganate sensitive \nsites in complexes of holo RNA polymerase with a DNA fragment that includes the \nLEE20-275 sequence (WT) or a derivative carrying the 98C mutation (98C). Lanes 1 and 3 \nshow the result after control incubations without RNA polymerase, whilst lanes 2 and 4 show \nthe analysis of samples with 50 nM RNA polymerase. The gel was calibrated using a Maxam-\nGilbert sequence reaction (GA) and relevant positions are indicated. The location of the LEE1 \nP1 promoter -10 and -35 elements are indicated by black boxes and the asterisks identify 6 \nconsecutive residues just downstream of the -10 element that display RNA polymerase-\ndependent reactivity to permanganate.  \nB. Autoradiogram of an analysis by gel electrophoresis of \n32\nP-labelled RNA transcripts made \nby RNA polymerase holoenzyme from PstI-BamHI fragments carrying wild type LEE20-275 \nsequences (lanes 1-3) and the 98C derivative (lanes 4-6). The RNA polymerase concentration \nwas: lanes 1 and 4, no enzyme; lanes 2 and 5, 200 nM; lane 3 and 6, 400 nM. The gel was \ncalibrated with the pSR plasmid-encoded 108 base RNA-I transcript (lane 7) and a Maxam-\nGilbert sequence reaction (GA). The proposed LEE1 P1 transcript is indicated by an asterisk. \n \nFig. 5.

Measurements were made in cells containing either \npSI02 (+GrlA: shaded bars) or empty vector, pACYC184\u0394HN (-GrlA: open bars).  \n \nFig. 9.  Analysis of GrlA-dependent activation using suppression genetics. \nA. The figure shows the GrlA amino acid sequence. The helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif \npredicted by Deng et al. (2004), and confirmed by the Dodd & Egan, GYM2.0 and Jpred \nprediction tools (see experimental procedures), is indicated by gray shading. Substitutions at \nR53 and I59, identified after random mutagenesis and selection for suppressors of the 92A \nmutation in the LEE1 P1 promoter, are indicated. The number adjacent to each substitution is \nnumber of times that it was isolated. \nB. The figures show the effect of GrlA substitutions on the activity of LEE1 P1 promoter \nmutants. The bar charts illustrate \u03b2-galactosidase activities in M182 cells carrying pRW224 \ncontaining the LEE20-203 fragment with single base substitutions, indicated on the X-axis. \nMeasurements were made in cells containing either pSI02 encoding wild type GrlA (WT, \nopen bars) or GrlA with the RK53, IT59 or IV59 substitutions, as indicated (grey bars).  \n \n24 \n \nFig. 10.  Epistasis analysis of GrlA interactions. \nThe figure shows bar charts that illustrate measured \u03b2-galactosidase activities in M182 cells \ncarrying pRW224 containing the LEE20-203 fragment with the starting LEE1 P1 promoter \nsequence (panel A), and with the 89G (panel B), 90C (panel C) or 91C (panel D) mutations. \nMeasurements were made as in Figure 5 with cells carrying pSI02 encoding wild type GrlA \n(WT) or the different alanine substitutions indicated on the X-axis. For each promoter, the \ndata are expressed as a percentage of the activity with wild type, the values are the average of \nthree independent assays, and standard errors are shown with error bars. \n \nFig. 11.
