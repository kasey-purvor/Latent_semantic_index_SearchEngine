Detrital zircon ages presented here show 39 \nthat some of the amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks previously mapped as 40 \nbasement have a Jurassic protolith. Overall the detrital zircon age patterns for 41 \n 2\nsamples of the Cordillera Darwin basement differ from those of the Madre de Dios 42 \nTerrane of the western Patagonian Andes with which they had been correlated; 43 \ninstead they are more comparable to those from the Eastern Andes Metamorphic 44 \nComplex, which apparently developed in a passive margin setting. The paucity of 45 \nCambrian detrital zircons indicates that the meta-igneous basement of the 46 \nMagallanes foreland basin of central and northern Tierra del Fuego was not the 47 \nmain source of detritus for the protolith of the Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic 48 \nComplex. The possibility is envisaged that the Magallanes Fagnano transform fault 49 \nboundary between the Scotia and South America plates resulted from reactivation 50 \nof an older, pre-Jurassic suture zone between the basement terranes of north-51 \ncentral Tierra del Fuego and Cordillera Darwin. 52 \n 53 \n 54 \n 55 \n 56 \nCordillera Darwin (Fig. 1) is the topographic culmination of the Fuegian Andes. Its 57 \ncore is occupied by the Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic Complex (CDMC, Kohn et 58 \nal. 1995), which includes a \u201cbasement unit\u201d formed by metapelitic and 59 \nmetapsammitic rocks together with previously undated meta-igneous rocks, a 60 \ncover of mainly rhyolitic volcanic rocks of the Upper Jurassic Tob\u00edfera Formation, 61 \nand intrusive plutonic bodies of different ages. The main structural, metamorphic, 62 \nintrusive and uplift history of Cordillera Darwin was revealed in a programme of 63 \npioneering field-work based research (Dalziel & Cort\u00e9s 1972; Nelson et al. 1980; 64 \nDalziel 1981, 1986; Nelson 1982, among others). It was shown that both 65 \nbasement and cover were involved in deformation and metamorphism that also 66 \naffected Late Jurassic granitoids of the Cordillera Darwin suite (Herv\u00e9 et al. 1981; 67 \nMukasa & Dalziel 1986).  68 \nThe CDMC is unique among the metamorphic complexes of the southern 69 \nAndes in having a high metamorphic grade, resulting in kyanite- and sillimanite-70 \nbearing amphibolite facies rocks, notwithstanding the occurrence of amphibolite-71 \nfacies metamorphic rocks containing staurolite and sillimanite elsewhere in 72 \nsouthern Patagonia, at Puerto Eden (Watters 1964; Calder\u00f3n et al. 2007a). The 73 \nCDMC basement rocks may contain relicts of a pre-Andean fabric (Dalziel and 74 \nCortes 1972; Nelson et al., 1980; Dalziel & Brown 1989), but according to Kohn et 75 \nal. (1995) metamorphic conditions \u201cevidently did not exceed lower greenschist 76 \ngrade prior to the Cretaceous\u201d; these authors also established that peak high-77 \ngrade metamorphism in the CDMC occurred between 90 and 100\u2013120 Ma, based 78 \non stratigraphical relationships, K\u2013Ar and Ar\u2013Ar metamorphic mineral ages, and 79 \nthe ages of cross-cutting plutons. 80 \nThe main deformation and high-grade metamorphism of the CDMC has been 81 \nassociated with the closure of the Rocas Verdes Basin (RVB) (Dalziel et al. 1974; 82 \nCalder\u00f3n et al. 2007b). Development of this quasi-oceanic extensional basin was 83 \nsynchronous with the initial stages of Gondwana break-up (Dalziel & Cortes 1972). 84 \nThe RVB was the depositional locus for the thick succession of Lower Cretaceous 85 \nvolcaniclastic sedimentary rocks of the Yaghan Formation (Katz & Watters 1966). 86 \nStudies carried in the Ultima Esperanza region indicate that  final closure of the 87 \n 3\nnorthern RVB  uplift, ophiolite obduction, and flexural loading of the South 88 \nAmerican margin occurred after the Cenomanian (93 Ma) as shown by the age of 89 \ndetrital zircons in the first turbidites infilling the subsequent Magallanes foreland 90 \nbasin (Fildani et al. 2003). 91 \n 92 \n 93 \n 94 \nPrevious constraints on the age of the CDMC protolith  95 \n 96 \nThe age and nature of the protolith of the CDMC basement is largely unknown. A 97 \ndepositional age can be constrained by regional stratigraphical relations with 98 \nMesozoic cover rocks. At Peninsula Staines, 350 km to the northwest of Cordillera 99 \nDarwin, metamorphic rocks are unconformably overlain by the Middle to Upper 100 \nJurassic siliceous volcanic strata of the Tob\u00edfera Formation (Allen et al. 1980). The 101 \nsame stratigraphical relationship is seen in the northern slope of the Cordillera 102 \nDarwin at Seno Almirantazgo (Dalziel & Cort\u00e9s 1972), where Johnson (1990) 103 \ndescribed a succession of conglomerate and sandstone up to 80 m thick (Basal 104 \nClastic Complex, BCC), which overlies the basement with an erosional 105 \nunconformity, and concordantly underlies Tob\u00edfera Formation volcanic rocks. A 106 \nRb\u2013Sr whole rock errorchron of 240 \u00b1 40 (2\u03c3) Ma was obtained for metamorphic 107 \nrocks from Bah\u00eda Pluschow belonging to the basement unit by Herv\u00e9 et al. (1981). 108 \nKohn et al. (1995) suggested that the CDMC basement corresponds to a 109 \nPalaeozoic to lower Mesozoic (?) metasedimentary and metavolcanic unit, 110 \nbelieved to have been originally deposited as an accretionary wedge on the pre-111 \nMid Jurassic Pacific margin of South America (Dalziel & Cort\u00e9s 1972; Nelson et al. 112 \n1980; Dalziel 1981, 1986). An alternative possibility has been suggested recently 113 \n(Herv\u00e9 et al. 2008), that it might be correlative with the Eastern Andes 114 \nMetamorphic Complex, deposited in a passive margin environment and cropping 115 \nout in the Patagonian Andes inboard of the Patagonian Batholith.  116 \n Barbeau et al. (2009) analysed detrital zircons from a sample (SONIA 1) 117 \n\u201cfrom the Cordillera Darwin complex\u201d, for which the youngest significant age peak 118 \nspans 260\u2013370 Ma. A statistically preferred calculated age of 289.3 \u00b1 2.7 Ma was 119 \ninterpreted as the best maximum depositional age; one grain gave a younger age 120 \nof 163 \u00b1 8 Ma, which is \u201csignificantly younger than the other estimates and 121 \nbiostratigraphic and detrital-zircon maximum depositional ages for broadly 122 \nequivalent metasedimentary units in the Patagonian Andes (Herv\u00e9 & Fanning 123 \n2003; Herv\u00e9 et al. 2003)\u201d. Nevertheless, part of the protolith of the CDMC includes 124 \nTob\u00edfera Formation rhyolites, particularly on the southern slope of Cordillera 125 \nDarwin (along the Beagle Channel), where strongly deformed and metamorphosed 126 \nrhyolite lenses appear to be tectonically interleaved with the metasedimentary 127 \nbasement units (Nelson et al. 1980).  128 \n The basement rocks of the CDMC are intruded by granitoid plutons, which 129 \nNelson (1981) grouped into two suites, confirmed by various dating methods: the 130 \nfoliated Mid Jurassic Darwin Suite (157 \u00b1 7 Ma, Herv\u00e9 et al. 1981; 164 \u00b1 4 Ma, 131 \nMukasa & Dalziel 1996) and the essentially post-metamorphic Cretaceous Beagle 132 \nSuite (70\u201390 Ma; Kohn et al. 1995; Mukasa & Dalziel 1996). The former suite was 133 \n 4\nmetamorphosed together with the CDMC basement in Late Cretaceous times 134 \n(Kohn et al. 1995), the granites being transformed into orthogneisses and the 135 \nmafic dykes that intrude them (considered as lateral equivalents of the mafic rocks 136 \nof the Rocas Verdes Basin) into amphibolites. The protolith of the high-grade 137 \n(staurolite and kyanite\u2013sillimanite) metamorphic rocks of Cordillera Darwin could 138 \nthus have been the Palaeozoic basement rocks, the Mesozoic cover rocks, or 139 \nboth.  140 \nNorth of Cordillera Darwin, U\u2013Pb dating of basement samples from the 141 \nbottom of oil-well boreholes drilled through the Cretaceous\u2013Cenozoic sedimentary 142 \nfill of the Magallanes foreland basin (Fig.1) establishes that the local basement 143 \nincludes Cambrian igneous and metamorphic rocks (S\u00f6llner et al. 2000; Pankhurst 144 \net al. 2003) below an erosional unconformity at the base of the Tob\u00edfera 145 \nFormation. Thus, the basement complexes of the Magallanes Basin and of 146 \nCordillera Darwin appear to differ significantly in their ages and lithology; they 147 \nwere the depositional surface for the Tob\u00edfera Formation in both areas, but their 148 \nmutual contact relationships are not exposed. 149 \nWe have determined U\u2013Pb SHRIMP ages on detrital zircons from 150 \nmetasedimentary rocks from the CDMC in an attempt to resolve their depositional 151 \nages and to examine their possible provenance from the adjacent Ediacaran to 152 \nearliest Cambrian basement of eastern Tierra del Fuego. Detrital zircon ages were 153 \nalso obtained from three low-grade metasedimentary rocks from the basal unit of 154 \nthe unconformably overlying Tob\u00edfera Formation, and from a granitic clast included 155 \nin them, as further constraints on the age of the CDMC from which they were 156 \nderived. Magmatic protolith ages were also determined on two metamorphic 157 \nborehole samples from Lago Mercedes (see Fig. 1). 158 \n  159 \nMethodology 160 \n  161 \nField work was carried out during four seasons of boat cruises in the area. After 162 \npetrographical inspection of over 100 samples, 20 were selected for isotopic 163 \nanalysis. Zircon concentrates were prepared at the Departamento de Geolog\u00eda, 164 \nUniversidad de Chile. The U\u2013Pb ages determined during this investigation were 165 \nobtained using SHRIMPs I, II and RG at the Research School of Earth Sciences, 166 \nThe Australian National University, Canberra. The measurement techniques are 167 \nsimilar to those of Williams (1998) and Herv\u00e9 et al. (2003). Cathodoluminescence 168 \n(CL) images were used throughout to select areas for analysis. In the case of the 169 \ndetrital zircon analyses, CL images were used to locate the youngest component 170 \nwithin any single zircon grain. Representative CL images of zircon grains analysed 171 \nare given with the electronic supplementary material. The Temora reference zircon 172 \n(Black et al. 2003) was used to calibrate the U\/Pb ratios, except for samples 173 \nFO0508, FO0524 and FO0545 where the Duluth Gabbro FC1 zircon was used 174 \n(Paces & Miller 1993).The data were processed using SQUID Excel Macro of 175 \nLudwig (2001), plots and age calculations have been made using ISOPLOT 176 \n(Ludwig 2003) incorporating the mixture modelling algorithm of Sambridge & 177 \nCompston (1994). The number of grains analysed varied depending on whether 178 \nthe sample was for age determination or for provenance (see figures and the 179 \n 5\nsupplementary material for the number of grains analysed for individual samples). 180 \nFor grains that were obviously older than 1000 Ma, 204Pb-corrected 207Pb\/206Pb 181 \nages were preferred, whereas for the younger grains 207Pb-corrected 238U-206Pb 182 \nages were considered more meaningful. Uncertainties are given as 1\u03c3 on the 183 \nanalytical measurements in the supplementary material and as 95% confidence 184 \nlimits on all calculated weighted mean ages reported in this paper. The initial 185 \nanalyses of samples FO0508, FO0539 gave unexpected and anomalous Jurassic 186 \ndates. Additional SHRIMP sessions were carried out to check these anomalies 187 \nand carry out further analyses; for sample FO0508 a second piece of the same 188 \nrock was separated at ANU. Results are summarized in Table 1 and plotted in 189 \nFigs. 2 to 7 (the full U-Th-Pb data tabulation is given in the supplementary 190 \nmaterial). The geological time-scale used is that of IUGS-ICS 2009 191 \n(www.stratigraphy.org). 192 \n  193 \nAnalysed samples 194 \n 195 \nBasal Clastic Complex of the Tob\u00edfera Formation 196 \n 197 \nRocks of this complex, assigned to the base of the Tob\u00edfera Formation by Johnson 198 \n(1990), crop out in the northern slope of Cordillera Darwin (Fig.1); they show only 199 \na faint foliation and weak metamorphism. Three arenite samples were collected at 200 \nSeno Almirantazgo. FO0524 is a feldspathic litharenite cropping out at Puerto 201 \nDemonio, Bah\u00eda Ainsworth, with quartz, plagioclase, slate\/phyllite, quartzite and 202 \nmarble clasts. It is part of a succession in which clast-supported conglomerates 203 \ncontaining 1\u201310 cm pebbles of quartz, micaschist and volcanic rocks predominate. 204 \nFO0531 is a sub-litharenite with phyllite, quartz and quartzite clasts from Bah\u00eda 205 \nAinsworth; it is part of a succession where conglomeratic sandstones and quartz 206 \nconglomerates predominate. The sandstones have shale laminae, cross-bedding, 207 \nand 1\u20132 m thick conglomerate beds with channelized bases. FO0539 is a foliated 208 \nquartzose phyllite from a conglomeratic succession at Puerto Hern\u00e1ndez, Fiordo 209 \nBrookes, which conformably underlies an ignimbrite bed dated at 168.7 \u00b1 1.4 Ma 210 \n(unpublished data by the authors). Finally, FO0516 is a 10 cm diameter granitic 211 \nclast from a matrix-supported foliated conglomerate bed at Fiordo Parry, with 212 \nmainly aphanitic siliceous volcanic rock clasts. 213 \n 214 \nCordillera Darwin Metamorphic Complex 215 \n 216 \nWe analysed three sets of samples from our Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic 217 \nComplex collections. The first set (samples FO0508, FO0518, FO0622, FO0533) 218 \ncame from the northern flank of the cordillera around Seno Almirantazgo. The 219 \nsecond set (FO0635 and FO0642) consists of samples from the Seno Searle 220 \nregion, to the southwest of the highest peaks of the cordillera. Finally, samples 221 \nPIA1, PIA7C, GA17 and GA26 were collected from the fjords north of the Beagle 222 \nChannel, along the southern flank of Cordillera Darwin. All locations are shown in 223 \nFig. 1 (GPS coordinates are given in the supplementary material). 224 \n 225 \n 6\nNorthern flank of Cordillera Darwin: FO0508 is a quartz-rich amphibole-bearing 226 \nfoliated rock with seams rich in biotite, from Fiordo Parry. FO0518 is a schist with 227 \nfine-grained bands consisting of quartz, biotite (including zircon with metamict 228 \nhalos), chlorite, traces of titanite and tourmaline, and quartz veinlets; it has a well 229 \ndeveloped crenulation cleavage. Ortiz (2007) determined the peak metamorphic 230 \nconditions for rocks in this area, which include biotite-garnet bearing schists, at 231 \n550\u2013580\u00baC and 5.0\u20135.4 kbar. A lower-temperature post-foliation metamorphic 232 \nimprint can also be observed, mainly transforming biotite to chlorite. FO0622 is a 233 \nmica-schist with small-scale folds, cropping out on the northern shore of Seno 234 \nKeats, just below the unconformity with the Tob\u00edfera Formation. Nelson (1981) 235 \ndescribed the structure here as a major synclinal fold that allowed the preservation 236 \nof the Tob\u00edfera. The sample contains detrital white micas and intensely folded 237 \nquartz veins. FO0533 is a poly-deformed banded phyllite from Seno Ainsworth. 238 \nThe bands consist of granoblastic quartz, finer-grained plagioclase, coarser 239 \namphibole and epidote intergrowths, with minor biotite and garnet. 240 \n 241 \nSouthern flank of Cordillera Darwin: Samples labelled PIA were collected at Bah\u00eda 242 \nPia, in the garnet\u2013staurolite zone of the amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks of 243 \nthe CDMC. PIA1 is a staurolite-bearing quartz-biotite schist and PIA7C is a 244 \nkyanite-bearing schist (Alvarez 2007). Samples labelled GA were collected from 245 \nSeno Garibaldi from biotite-grade metamorphic rocks (Alvarez 2007): GA17 is a 246 \nrhyolitic dyke intruding the metamorphic basement in the Schists Unit (Alvarez 247 \n2007), and GA26 a poly-deformed silicic volcanic rock.  248 \n 249 \nSouth-western Cordillera Darwin (Seno Searle): FO0635 is a weakly foliated white 250 \nmica\u2013biotite metapelite from Seno Searle. It is interlayered with greenschist and 251 \nrocks interpreted in the field as silicic tuffs. FO0642 is a poorly foliated hornfelsic 252 \nquartzite, consisting of an aggregate of fine-grained quartz, plagioclase and 253 \nchloritized biotite, with epidote-bearing veinlets, from the northern shore of Seno 254 \nSearle. The outcrop displays small-scale shear zones and is intruded by mafic 255 \ndykes and a Jurassic diorite. Their locations are shown in Fig. 1. 256 \n 257 \nNorthwest of Cordillera Darwin  258 \n 259 \nThe basement rocks in this area are low-grade metasedimentary rocks. FO0545 is 260 \na grey banded phyllite with complexly folded bands rich in quartz, white mica and 261 \nbiotite, from a small island at the entrance of Seno Inman. FO0751 is a micaschist 262 \nwith abundant granoblastic quartz veins and aggregates, in bands of fine-grained 263 \nquartz, white mica, chlorite, titanite with crenulation cleavage, and some coarser-264 \ngrained white mica aggregates. FO0718 is a foliated carbonaceous metapelite 265 \nwith decussate biotite, white mica and quartz bands, with accessory tourmaline 266 \ncrystals and secondary white mica-bearing veins. FO0701, from the northern 267 \nshore of the Strait of Magellan, is a quartzite with relict detrital texture, with quartz 268 \nand plagioclase clasts in a foliated fine-grained quartz, white mica, chlorite, and 269 \nepidote matrix; there are pressure-solution seams of opaque minerals, and 270 \npressure shadows around some of the clasts. 271 \n 7\n 272 \nBasement of the Magallanes foreland basin 273 \n 274 \nSamples LM1 and LM2 were provided by Empresa Nacional del Petr\u00f3leo (ENAP) 275 \nand came from the bottom of two deep exploration boreholes at Lago Mercedes, 276 \nTierra del Fuego, 60 km north of Seno Almirantazgo (Fig. 1). LM1 is a foliated 277 \namphibolite and LM2 a banded orthogneiss. 278 \n 279 \nResults 280 \n 281 \nThe analytical data are presented in Table 1 (supplementary material), and in 282 \nFigures 2 to 7. All calculated ages are reported with 95% confidence limit 283 \nuncertainties. For close comparison, ages reported from previous literature are 284 \nquoted with 2\u03c3 uncertainties.  285 \n 286 \nBasal Clastic Complex of the Tob\u00edfera Formation 287 \n 288 \nThe detrital age distribution of sandstone FO0524 exhibits a predominant broad 289 \npeak which can be unmixed into two components, c. 530 and c. 550 Ma, both 290 \nCambrian in age (see relative probability plots, Fig.2). Scattered ages in the range 291 \n350\u2013470 Ma are subordinate to Permian ages, with a more prominent group at c. 292 \n270 Ma and a smaller one at c. 245 Ma. Neoproterozoic grains are scarce. 293 \nSandstone FO0531 has a predominant and well defined younger peak at 163.0 \u00b1 294 \n1.7 Ma (8 analyses, MSWD = 1.02), with subdued Permian (c. 280 Ma), 295 \nCarboniferous (c. 345 Ma) and Cambrian (c. 545 Ma) peaks. A very minor group of 296 \n1.0\u20131.2 Ga is seen within a wide dispersion of Proterozoic ages. The quartzose 297 \nphyllite FO0539 records a wide range of detrital zircon ages, but with dominant 298 \nCarboniferous peaks at 337.2 \u00b1 3.9 Ma (11 grains, MSWD = 0.84) and c. 360 Ma 299 \n(5 grains). Also present are Grenville-age peaks (c. 1030 Ma and c. 1100 Ma, 6 300 \ngrains in each case), and a smaller late Neoproterozoic one (c. 615 Ma, 4 grains), 301 \nwith scattered Late Cambrian\u2013Early Ordovician and Early Devonian ages also 302 \nrecorded. Two grains record Jurassic dates; a second analysis of the original 303 \nsingle grain is reproduced and another also recorded during follow-up analyses in 304 \nsecond SHRIMP analytical session. Lastly, the granite clast FO0516 has a single 305 \npopulation of zoned igneous zircon. Two of the analysed grains appear to have 306 \nlost radiogenic Pb, but the remaining 18 give a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 307 \n465.6 \u00b1 3.2 Ma (MSWD= 1.08), which is interpreted as the Mid Ordovician age of 308 \ngranite crystallization. 309 \n 310 \nCordillera Darwin Metamorphic Complex 311 \n 312 \nNorthern flank of Cordillera Darwin (Fig. 3). Amphibole-bearing schist FO0508 is 313 \ndominated by detrital zircons at around 400 Ma; 43 analyses from the 122 grains 314 \nanalysed are within uncertainty of a weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 404.1 \u00b1 5.2 315 \nMa (MSWD =1.7). There are 8 analyses (from 6 grains) that are within uncertainty 316 \nof a younger peak at 166 \u00b1 2 Ma (MSWD = 1.14) \u2013 these ages come from grains 317 \n 8\nthat are predominantly igneous in origin. A second separation of this sample was 318 \nmade, but no Jurassic ages were identified from the 50 grains analysed. Some 319 \nscattered early Palaeozoic ages are recorded, but the main pre-Devonian 320 \nprovenance is from 600\u2013680 Ma sources.  321 \nSample FO0518 shows two ill-defined main groupings around 600 Ma (500 322 \nto 750 Ma) and around 1000 Ma (800 to 1200 Ma) with a tail to 2600 Ma of 323 \nMesoproterozoic to Archaean grains.  324 \nMicaschist FO0622 shows a zircon age spectrum (ignoring spot #28.1, c. 110 325 \nMa) that is characterized by numerous peaks or groupings, but with no stand-326 \nalone significant age grouping. There are two peaks at c. 385 and c. 405 Ma, an 327 \nage gap, then a series of approximately equal, closely-spaced peaks at c. 510, c. 328 \n530, c. 565, c. 600 and c. 620 Ma. A broad Meso-Neoproterozoic range of ages is 329 \nobserved with a more prominent peak at about 1040 Ma, as well as some 330 \nPalaeoproterozoic grains (1880\u20132000 Ma). 331 \nThe data for phyllite FO0533 show a dominant concentration at 440\u2013480 Ma, 332 \nwith a dominant age defined by 12 grains at 450.2 \u00b1 4.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.76) and a 333 \nsubordinate group at 473.1 \u00b1 5.3 Ma (10 analyses, MSWD = 0.92). Eight grains 334 \nhave ages between 560 and 670 Ma, and further nine between 985 and 1150 Ma. 335 \nThere is a significant presence of earliest Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean grains, 336 \nwith 13 having ages between 2460 and 2660 Ma, and a sub-peak at about 2620 337 \nMa.  338 \n 339 \nSouthern flank of Cordillera Darwin (Fig. 4). The staurolite-bearing schist sample 340 \nPIA1 yielded relatively few zircons; they range up to 100\u00b5m in length though many 341 \nare less than 50 \u00b5m. They are round to sub-round, elongate to equant in shape, 342 \nand exhibit both zoned igneous and more homogeneous CL structure, the latter 343 \ninterpreted as metamorphic. The relative probability plot is characterized by a 344 \nnumber of closely spaced age peaks, seemingly a continuum from c. 300 Ma to c. 345 \n700 Ma, with other groupings at 880 to 900 Ma and c. 975 to c. 1180 Ma. There 346 \nare some scattered older Palaeoproterozoic ages. For the 300\u2013700 Ma age range, 347 \nsmall but significant peaks occur at c. 330, c. 430, c. 465, c. 520 and c. 560 Ma, 348 \nwith subordinate clusters of Brasiliano ages (approximately 650\u2013700 Ma). No 349 \nzircon grains younger than c. 300 Ma were recorded. 350 \nThe relative probability distribution of ages for kyanite schist PIA7C also 351 \nshows a range of peaks, mainly between c. 480 Ma and c. 630 Ma. The most 352 \nprominent peaks are at c. 480 Ma and c. 520 Ma, and lesser ones at c. 550 Ma, c. 353 \n590 Ma and c. 630 Ma. There are scattered older grains, some with Brasiliano 354 \nages between c. 630 and c. 710 Ma, as well as a spread of \u2018Grenvillian\u2019 ages, and 355 \nthree grains with Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean ages. 356 \nThe rhyolite dyke GA17 contains a relatively uniform population of euhedral, 357 \nprismatic zircons that have a simple zoned igneous internal structure under CL 358 \nimaging. The relative probability plot of 206Pb\/238U ages is skewed slightly to the 359 \nolder side; there also appears to have been some radiogenic Pb loss. A weighted 360 \nmean of 16 of the 20 analyses gives 159.1 \u00b1 1.4 Ma (MSWD =1.7) and this is 361 \ninterpreted as the time of zoned igneous zircon crystallization in the rhyolite dyke. 362 \nGA26, a silicic volcanic rock, has a disparate population of zircons that range from 363 \n 9\nlow-U (100\u2013350 ppm) euhedral and oscillatory-zoned igneous zircon to extremely 364 \nhigh-U (up to 13,850 ppm), dark to opaque, metamict zircon. The latter constitute 365 \nthe majority of the grains in the heavy mineral concentrate and were mostly not 366 \nsuitable for analysis; moreover, the SHRIMP U\/Pb ratio calibration does not hold 367 \nwell for such extreme U contents (Williams & Hergt 2000), so that the variable 368 \nages obtained from the few analysed high-U grains are not considered reliable. 369 \nThe low-U grains tend to group at about 155 Ma and this is the likely time of zoned 370 \nigneous zircon formation. 371 \n 372 \nSouth-western Cordillera Darwin (Seno Searle)(Fig. 5). Metapelite FO0635, from 373 \nwhich 70 zircon grains were analysed, displays a predominant peak at c. 130 Ma 374 \n(Early Cretaceous), a Permian peak at c. 270 Ma, a smaller peak at c. 370 Ma; 375 \nthere are dispersed grains in the interval 430 to 555 Ma (Silurian to latest 376 \nProterozoic), a small peak at 460 Ma (Ordovician), and a few scattered 377 \nProterozoic grains.  378 \nPermian zircons were also found in quartzite FO0642, with 26 of 60 analysed 379 \ngrains recording ages between 255 and 300 Ma; these can be sub-divided, a 380 \ngroup of 9 grains yielding a mean age of c. 260 Ma, a second group of 11 grains 381 \nyielding c. 275 Ma and a third group of 6 grains yielding c. 290 Ma. Among the 382 \nolder ages, there is a minor Carboniferous group at about 320 Ma and then a 383 \ncontinuum from c. 385 to 520 Ma, albeit with 6 ages concentrated around c. 485 384 \nMa (Early Ordovician). Some scattered Neoproterozoic ages are also present. 385 \n 386 \nNorthwest of Cordillera Darwin  387 \n 388 \nGrey banded phyllite FO0545 shows a very wide range of detrital zircon ages, with 389 \nmany between 490 and 700 Ma (Fig. 6). Isolated grains younger than 490 Ma are 390 \ninterpreted as having lost radiogenic Pb and are not considered further in this 391 \ndiscussion. There is a prominent group of 11 analyses within uncertainty of 596 \u00b1 392 \n6 Ma and a subordinate group of 6 analyses at 504 \u00b1 6 Ma, with lesser groupings 393 \naround c. 540 and c. 630 Ma. A significant group of 15 grains with ages between 394 \n950 and 1150 Ma indicates a component of Grenville-age provenance, with an 395 \napparent peak at c. 1045 Ma. Some Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean grains are 396 \nalso present, but in isolation their significance is difficult to interpret. 397 \n The areas analysed from the quartz-rich micaschist FO0751 from Bahia Morris 398 \nare enriched in common Pb and this seems to be a mount-related problem and 399 \nleads to a scattered Tera-Wasserburg plot (not shown). However, the 204Pb-400 \ncorrected Grenville-age and older grains are within uncertainty of concordia, so the 401 \ncorrected 206Pb\/238U ratios are probably reasonable, at least for the main peaks. 402 \nThe peaks include a predominant latest Proterozoic one, with minor groupings and 403 \nindividual ages from Late Proterozoic to Archaean.  404 \nThe areas analysed from FO0718 on the same mount as FO0751 are 405 \nsimilarly enriched in common Pb. The 204Pb-corrected Grenville-age and older 406 \ngrains are within uncertainty of concordia, and for the younger grains the corrected 407 \n206Pb\/238U ratios are probably reasonable. The latter dominantly give Permian 408 \n 10\ndates and the weighted mean for 26 grains is 277 \u00b1 3 Ma, with a subordinate 409 \nslightly older grouping close to 290\u2013295 Ma. 410 \nSample FO0701 is dominated by Carboniferous zircons. There is a broad 411 \nconcentration of data at around 300\u2013360 Ma, with two possible peaks unmixed at 412 \nabout 330 and 345 Ma, but it is not possible to identify any specific major events. 413 \n 414 \nBasement of the Magallanes foreland basin  415 \n 416 \nBanded amphibolite sample LM1 has a population of relatively coarse-grained, 417 \nhomogeneous glassy zircon, with broad internal CL zoning commonly seen in 418 \nigneous zircons from gabbroic rocks (see supplementary material). A large 419 \nnumber of grains were analysed and the relative probability plot shows a dominant 420 \nsingle age peak, with a significant tail on the younger side, interpreted as due to 421 \nloss of radiogenic Pb during metamorphism of this basic igneous rock. The well-422 \ndefined Cambrian weighted mean 206Pb\/238U age of 527.2 \u00b1 5.2 Ma (MSWD = 1.5, 423 \n60 grains out of 72; Fig. 7) is interpreted as the time of igneous zircon 424 \ncrystallization in the pre-metamorphic protolith. Sample LM2 (granitic orthogneiss) 425 \nis also dominated by igneous zircon occurring as elongate grains up to 100\u2013426 \n200\u00b5m in length with oscillatory-zoned interiors. The relative probability plot shows 427 \na dominant age peak with a tail on the younger side and a series of younger U-Pb 428 \nages. From the Tera-Wasserburg plot, these younger analyses are interpreted as 429 \nareas that have lost radiogenic Pb (grain 4 has 5,300 ppm U and has clearly lost 430 \nradiogenic Pb). The main group yields a well-defined weighted mean 206Pb\/238U 431 \nage of 536.8 \u00b1 3.3 Ma (MSWD = 1.4, 39 grains out of 60; Fig.6), giving the time of 432 \nzoned igneous zircon crystallization. 433 \n 434 \nDiscussion 435 \n 436 \nIdentifying basement and cover in the CDMC 437 \n 438 \nSince one of the main goals of this contribution was to investigate the nature, age 439 \nand provenance of the CDMC, it was first necessary to establish reliable criteria to 440 \nseparate the basement and cover, as metamorphosed \u201ccover\u201d (of Jurassic\u2013Lower 441 \nCretaceous rocks) is an important component of the CDMC. Clearly, those 442 \nmetamorphic rocks analysed that contain Jurassic and\/or Cretaceous zircons were 443 \nmost probably part of the cover sequences. This obviously applies to the BCC 444 \nsample FO0531, but could also include sample FO0508, which was collected from 445 \nan area mapped as basement but which contains rare grains of zoned igneous 446 \nzircon, clearly not related to a post-depositional in situ metamorphic event. The 447 \ninterpretation that best matches the data is that this amphibolite-grade rock is a 448 \nmetamorphosed age-equivalent of the BCC. A similar situation may be 449 \nrepresented by sample SONIA1 analysed by Barbeau et al. (2009), which was 450 \ncollected from an area shown as basement on their Figure 1 but as Tob\u00edfera 451 \nFormation on our map (based on SERNAGEOMIN 2002). The possibility that 452 \nrocks such as these are equivalents of the BCC rather than part of the CDMC 453 \nbasement unit proper illustrates the difficulty of distinguishing the two where 454 \n 11\ndeformation is high. It also emphasizes that in such widespread metamorphic 455 \nterrains it is not always possible to confidently assign outcrops to specific mapped 456 \nunits; in some ways better insight may be obtained through detailed isotope 457 \nstudies such as herein. The mid-to-Late Cretaceous high-grade metamorphism 458 \nmight well have affected these Jurassic (early Cretaceous?) rocks and erased the 459 \noriginal structural fabric of the protolith, although this has remained recognisable, 460 \nfor example, in the Jurassic rhyolites and dyke (samples GA17, GA26) at Seno 461 \nGaribaldi, where metamorphic grade is lower. In the south-western part of the 462 \nCordillera Darwin, at Seno Searle, metapelites with zircons of Cretaceous ages 463 \n(FO0635) have been deformed, metamorphosed and incorporated in the CDMC, 464 \nbut their metamorphic grade is, once more, lower than in most of the CDMC. 465 \nThese rocks probably are metamorphosed equivalents of the Yaghan Formation, 466 \nand thus belong to the cover of the CDMC. 467 \nThe presence of Jurassic zircon grains cannot be considered the only 468 \ntrustworthy distinguishing criterion, since such grains are not recorded in all BCC 469 \nsamples. However, the analysed BCC samples (except FO0539) consistently 470 \nrecord Permian detrital zircon age peaks, whereas in most of the samples clearly 471 \nassigned to the CDMC basement the youngest detrital zircon population is 472 \nCarboniferous in age. We thus consider, as a working principle, that CDMC rocks 473 \nwith Permian and younger zircon populations represent part of the Cordillera 474 \nDarwin cover sequence and samples with older zircon age spectra are part of the 475 \nCDMC basement.  476 \nIt was not possible during this research to identify and date basement 477 \nigneous rocks, whose existence has been previously indicated (e.g., Herv\u00e9 et al. 478 \n1981) 479 \n 480 \nThe basements of the CDMC and of the Magallanes foreland basin: two 481 \ndistinct terranes?  482 \n 483 \nDetrital zircon age spectra from metasedimentary rocks considered as part of the 484 \nCDMC basement, according to the above mentioned criteria, show mainly early 485 \nPalaeozoic, Proterozoic and even Archaean peaks. The dominant Palaeozoic 486 \npeaks differ between individual samples: 500 Ma (Late Cambrian) in FO0545, 480 487 \nMa (Early Ordovician) in PIA7C, 450 Ma (Late Ordovician) in FO0533, and 400\u2013488 \n405 Ma (Early Devonian) in FO0508 and FO0622. Together with the Precambrian 489 \ndetritus, these spectra indicate a mixture of igneous sources derived from different 490 \nparts of Gondwana. It is possible that detrital zircons in this area had a source in 491 \nLaurentia, and we cannot rule out the idea that there was a collision between 492 \nGondwana and Laurentia near the Proterozoic\u2013Phanerozoic boundary (e.g., 493 \nDalziel 1997, Dalla Salda et al. 1992). 494 \nCambrian detrital zircons are not very abundant in the three samples from 495 \nthe northern CDMC, but significant in those from the south. Additionally, the latter 496 \nalso have sizeable Ordovician peaks of c. 470\u2013480 Ma, an age usually associated 497 \nwith the Famatinian orogenic belt that extends from north-western Argentina as far 498 \nsouth as the North Patagonian Massif, but hitherto unknown from southern 499 \nPatagonia. Yet, the 465.6 \u00b1 3.2 Ma age for the FO0516 granite clast from the 500 \n 12\nBasal Clastic Complex implies that igneous rocks of this age were exposed 501 \nreasonably close to the Cordillera Darwin region during the Jurassic.  502 \nThe youngest significant zircon grains in each sample give maximum early 503 \nPalaeozoic (Ordovician to Devonian) ages for their deposition. These ages vary 504 \nconsiderably between different samples. Despite some uncertainties over possible 505 \nradiogenic Pb-loss, maximum sedimentation ages may be assigned as Early 506 \nDevonian for FO0508, Late Ordovician for FO0533, Early Ordovician (ca. 490 Ma) 507 \nfor FO0545, and mid-Ordovician for the host rock of FO0516. In the first two cases 508 \nthe dominance of the younger peaks over older ages could be taken to suggest 509 \nerosion of a penecontemporaneous magmatic arc. On the southern flank of the 510 \nCDMC, sample PIA7C has minimum zircon ages of 405 Ma (Early Devonian), but 511 \nalso has single-grain ages extending into the Carboniferous (ca. 365 and 340 Ma). 512 \nPIA1 has a significant Early Carboniferous peak at c. 330 Ma. Since the 513 \nsignificance of single-grain based ages may not be reliable, we suggest that the 514 \npatterns presented indicate deposition mainly during the Early Palaeozoic in the 515 \nnorth and Late Palaeozoic in the southern slope of Cordillera Darwin. 516 \nThe SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age spectra of rocks from the basement of the 517 \nMagallanes foreland basin collected from the oil wells at Lago Mercedes differ 518 \nsignificantly from those of the Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic Complex. The well-519 \ndefined Early Cambrian ages of the former are interpreted here as crystallization 520 \nages of igneous rocks, i.e., the protoliths of the present-day foliated gneiss and 521 \namphibolites. Foliated granitoids of c. 530 Ma have previously been demonstrated 522 \nto underlie the Tob\u00edfera Formation of northern Tierra del Fuego (S\u00f6llner et al. 523 \n2000; Pankhurst et al. 2003) and are part of the Tierra del Fuego Igneous and 524 \nMetamorphic Complex (TFIMC; Herv\u00e9 et al. in revision); together with our new 525 \ndata, this suggests that such Cambrian igneous rocks are widespread in the 526 \nbasement of the Magallanes Basin. The scarcity of Cambrian detrital zircons in the 527 \nCDMC is at odds with the occurrence of extensive Cambrian orthogneisses and 528 \namphibolites in the basement of central and northern Tierra del Fuego. It might be 529 \nexpected that these Cambrian rocks should be one the most likely candidates to 530 \nprovide detrital zircons for CDMC protolith in the early Palaeozoic, as is the case 531 \nwith samples FO0545 and FO0751. However, significant Cambrian detrital zircon 532 \npopulations appeared in sedimentary rock of the Cordillera Darwin region only in 533 \nthe Jurassic, when the \u201cBasal Clastic Complex\u201d was deposited unconformably 534 \nover the CDMC at Seno Almirantazgo.  535 \nThus, according to standard definitions (Howell 1989), the basements of the 536 \nMagallanes foreland basin and the CDMC constitute two separate and distinct 537 \ntectonostratigraphic terranes. The basement of the Magallanes foreland basin is 538 \ncurrently found 4 km below sea level, whereas that of the CDMC crops out at up to 539 \n2 km above sea level. These two basement terranes lie respectively to the north 540 \nand south of the left-lateral Magallanes\u2013Fagnano transform fault system (MFFS, 541 \nFig. 1), which forms the boundary between the Scotia and South American plates; 542 \nthe CDMC is located within the Scotia plate and the Fuegian foreland in the South 543 \nAmerican plate. Although strike-slip motion along the Magallanes Fagnano 544 \ntransform during the Cenozoic may explain the juxtaposition of the two terranes, 545 \nestimated displacement along the transform boundary seems to be rather modest 546 \n 13\n(55 km according to Rossello 2005). This, together with the fact that the 547 \ndistribution of Jurassic and younger units and early Cenozoic structures can be 548 \nmatched across the fault regardless of displacement, leads us to suggest that the 549 \nMFFS possibly resulted from the reactivation of and old, pre-Jurassic suture 550 \nbetween the Cordillera Darwin and Tierra del Fuego basement terranes. The two 551 \nterranes amalgamated before the deposition of the Basal Clastic Complex. 552 \n 553 \nRegional correlations of the CDMC basement 554 \n 555 \nThe data presented here can be interpreted as indicating that the clastic protolith 556 \nof the CDMC basement was not mainly derived from the presently adjacent, 557 \nthough buried, igneous\/metamorphic basement of the Magallanes foreland basin. 558 \nFurthermore, the zircon age spectra for most of the CDMC basement samples 559 \nmake untenable earlier correlations with the Madre de Dios Terrane that forms 560 \npart of the western Patagonian archipelagos, north of the Strait of Magellan, as the 561 \nlatter includes clastic metasediments (Duque de York Complex; Forsythe & 562 \nMpodozis 1979, 1983; Sep\u00falveda et al. 2007) characterized by prominent Permian 563 \ndetrital zircons (Herv\u00e9 et al. 2003). However, one sample (FO0642) from the 564 \nstrongly tectonized Seno Searle region, the south-westernmost locality sampled, 565 \nand sample FO0718, northwest of Cordillera Darwin have a youngest prominent 566 \nPermian peak, so that these samples might represent either fragments of the 567 \nDuque de York Complex or younger sediments tectonically interleaved with the 568 \nCDMC basement, and deformed and metamorphosed together during the 569 \nCretaceous. Despite this, most CDMC basement samples are more comparable in 570 \ntheir detrital zircon age spectra to some samples of the Eastern Andes 571 \nMetamorphic Complex. This complex crops out along the eastern Andean foothills 572 \nnorth of 50\u00baS (Herv\u00e9 et al. 2003; Augustsson & Bahlburg 2007; Herv\u00e9 et al. 2008), 573 \nand was considered by Herv\u00e9 and Mpodozis (2005) as an exotic terrane (Fitz Roy 574 \nterrane) accreted against southern Patagonia in, probably, early Jurassic times. 575 \nNotwithstanding these similarities, at present the Cordillera Darwin basement 576 \ncannot be considered an integral part of the former as the intervening Cambrian 577 \nmeta-igneous terrane of Tierra del Fuego disrupts the geographic continuity of 578 \nthese two separate tectonic domains. 579 \n 580 \nConclusions  581 \n 582 \nThe metasedimentary basement unit present in the Cordillera Darwin Metamorphic 583 \nComplex, characterized by mainly Early Palaeozoic detrital zircons as the 584 \nyoungest components, differs from the Cambrian meta-igneous basement of the 585 \nMagallanes foreland basin. It also differs from the Duque de York Complex, part of 586 \nthe Madre de Dios Terrane, in that samples of the latter have a prominent Early 587 \nPermian detrital zircon component. The detrital zircon patterns of the CDMC are 588 \nmore comparable to those of the Eastern Andes Metamorphic Complex further 589 \nnorth in the Patagonian Andes, interpreted as having been deposited in a passive 590 \nmargin setting. However, at present, both areas are spatially separated by the 591 \nCambrian meta-igneous basement of the Magallanes foreland basin in Tierra del 592 \n 14\nFuego, and they cannot be considered to form a continuous rock body. The 593 \npresence of Ordovician detrital zircons and granitic clasts complicates the 594 \nidentification of the source areas, as granites of such ages are not known in 595 \nsouthern Patagonia. 596 \nThe CDMC lies in the Scotia Plate, whose Cenozoic boundary with the South 597 \nAmerica plate is the left lateral wrench Magallanes\u2013Fagnano fault system (MFFS). 598 \nThe detrital zircon patterns of the CDMC basement unit are more complex than if 599 \nthey had the exclusively Cambrian igneous source of the presently adjacent 600 \nMagallanes foreland basin basement. This suggests that the two areas were not 601 \nside-by-side during the Early Palaeozoic, but that their amalgamation occurred 602 \nprior to the Middle Jurassic, as indicated by Jurassic Tob\u00edfera volcanic rocks 603 \nunconformably deposited over both basements. The MFFS was thus probably 604 \ndeveloped along the site of an older suture, located in the contact between the 605 \nCDMC and the meta-igneous Cambrian Magallanes foreland basin basement.  606 \nJurassic detrital zircons are present in some samples of the CDMC, including 607 \nsome from outcrops assigned to the basement in some maps; their zircon age 608 \npatterns resemble those in the sedimentary rocks that lie unconformably over the 609 \nbasement unit of the CDMC and concordantly below the Tob\u00edfera Formation. Thus 610 \nzircon data and field relationships are consistent in showing that the CDMC cover 611 \nunits were deposited in Jurassic times and were deformed and metamorphosed to 612 \nhigh grades along with the CDMC basement during Cretaceous times.   613 \n 614 \nAcknowledgements 615 \n  616 \nField trips were undertaken in the yachts Penguin and Foam, with captains 617 \nConrado Alvarez and David Lleufo.
