INTRODUCTION\nDifferent carbon and hydrocarbon sources have been\nused as precursors for the growth of diamond-like amor-\nphous carbon ~DAC! and hydrogenated carbon nitride\n(CxNyHz) films with the ultimate aim of synthesizing wear\nresistant films which offer good chemical, optical, mechani-\ncal, and tribological properties.1 Traditionally, graphite and\nlow molecular weight hydrocarbons ~C1Hx and C2Hx! have\nbeen the main carbon sources used for the deposition of dia-\nmond, DAC and CxNyHz films deposited using various\nplasma regimes. In this context, higher molar mass mol-\necules such as adamantane, C10H16 ~136.24 MW!, are of in-\nterest in that these offer the possibility of deposition via\nCxHy clusters of significant size,2 where x53 \u2013 10. An im-\nportant potential benefit in this case is that carbon clusters\nare reported3 to play a significant role in the growth of dia-\nmond, DAC, and related CN films.

The present work addresses the\nfragmentation, in an inductively coupled rf plasma, of the\ntricyclic hydrocarbon adamantane and the significance of this\nwith respect to film deposition.\nThe hydrocarbon, adamantane, and its triaza-analogue,\nhexamethylenetetramine as precursors are known2 to involve\nmolecular fragmentations giving substantial abundances of\nrelatively stable polyatomic clusters. As a result, faster depo-\nsition, different, or even better DAC-type films may result\nfrom such precursors under appropriately selected running\nconditions. In the course of the study of the mass-energy\nprofile of the contents of an inductively coupled rf plasma,\nderived from the Ar\/C10H16 system, differently sized clusters\nof significant abundances were observed in the power range\nused ~50\u2013200 W at 13.56 MHz!. These clusters, demonstra-\nbly, had reasonable stability\/lifetimes, i.e., the abundances of\nvarious clusters observed change as the applied power, in the\nfirst instance, was switched manually, up or down in the\nindicated operating power range. For better control and con-\nvenience, a switchable power supply, offering a selected\n\u2018\u2018ON\/OFF\u2019\u2019 duty cycle at a given power level was designed\nand implemented.

In conse-\nquence, films can be deposited, using a selected cluster or\nfrom a mixed- cluster regime where one or two clusters are\ndominant, without sophisticated mass-selected filtering. As\ndescribed, successful selection of clusters has been achieved,\nusing a pulsed rf inductively coupled plasma ~ICP! under the\ndeposition conditions outlined in Sec. II. The plasma con-\ntents were characterized by mass spectroscopy and Langmuir\nprobe plasma diagnostics, while the deposited films were\ncharacterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, contact\nangle, and optical measurements.\nII. EXPERIMENT\nAdamantane, C10H16 , as a precursor, fragments in the\nplasma to give clusters of significant size with reasonable\nstability\/lifetimes in the user-defined running regime of the\nICP source. The abundances of the various clusters generated\nare found2 to change as the applied power is switched up or\ndown in the 50\u2013200 W rf power level range. Running the\npower supply in the switched mode, for a chosen power\nlevel, gas pressure, and flow, a power \u2018\u2018on\/off\u2019\u2019 ratio can be\nset so as to favor the presence of particular clusters in the\nplasmas. The pulse unit was designed and engineered in-\nhouse, then integrated with the processing system. A simpli-\nfied schematic explaining the operating mode of the pulse\nunit is shown in Fig. 1.

Blank, unbiased\nsurface-oxidized silicon coupons ~1\u20133 cm2!, typified by D00\n~;2 cm2!, cleaned ultrasonically in redistilled iso-propanol\njust prior to deposition, were used as substrates.

Reliable control of the deposition regime\nrequires a constant flow and a constant pressure of the pre-\ncursors for running with the chosen fixed argon or fixed ni-\ntrogen flow, over an extended and controllable period of\ntime.

The self-compensating\nLangmuir probe13 used consisted in this case of a thin tung-\nsten wire appropriately positioned in the plasma. In practice,\nthis probe, driven by a programmable dc voltage, is used to\noutput the electrical characteristics of the plasma, i.e., bulk\nelectron temperature kTe , plasma potential Vp , floating\nvoltage V f , electron energy distribution ~eed!, and ion\/\nelectron density (Ni , Ne), etc. The current I drawn by the\nprobe is measured as a function of the driving voltage V to\nextract an I\u2013V characteristic which is governed by the com-\nposition and the thermodynamic state of the plasma.\nThe CxHy films ~D01\u2013D02 , D06\u2013D07! and those contain-\ning nitrogen CxNyHz ~D03\u2013D05 , and D08\u2013D13!, were pre-\npared using the rf ~13.56 MHz!

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Cluster selection\nPrior to the current work reporting on the cluster depo-\nsition of DAC and its nitrogen-containing analoguesloaded 19 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP l(CxNyHz), a systematic study was carried out to determine\nhow the selected deposition regime affects the plasma. The\npower level of the rf plasma and the operating pressure play\na dominant role in the fragmentation of adamantane in the\ninductively coupled source used, consequently on the plasma\ncomposition ~and therefrom, the deposited films!. The ob-\nserved abundances of clusters of a particular size resulting\nfrom the fragmentation of adamantane molecule, is found to\nbe a function of the power level and the processing gas\nmakeup and pressure. For instance, at a low gas pressure\n;1 mTorr, a higher power level will be favorable to the\npresence of low mass clusters ~mass ;26! whereas, a lower\npower level will provide a larger cluster mass range, includ-\ning clusters in significant numbers at high masses. Similarly,\nfor a chosen power level, a low gas pressure will show low\nmass clusters in contrast to the behavior at higher pressures,\ngiving cluster masses in the range of 12\u2013136. This is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 3~a! where the abundance and size of the clus-\nters are related directly to the power level and gas pressure,\ne.g., at 150 W at 1mTorr, the mass 26 cluster, C2H2 , is\ndominant @Fig. 3~a1!# whereas additional species appear in a\ncomparable proportion at 80 W and 1.3 mTorr @Fig. 3~a2!#.\nIn turn, an increase of the pressure to 23 mTorr for 80 W\n@Fig. 3~a3!#, induces a change in the cluster population, in\nthe sense that a much higher abundance ~intensity! appear for\nC7H9\n1 clusters ~mass 93!.\nA significant operational factor, resulting from the ob-\nserved stability of the cluster species in the plasma, is the\nswitchable on\/off ratio chosen to drive the plasma at a se-\nlected power level. For a chosen deposition regime, in terms\nof power level and operating pressure, flow etc., if the\nplasma is switched \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018off\u2019\u2019 to give a particular on\/\noff ratio, clusters of particular size appear preferentially un-\nder diagnostic mass analysis of the plasma contents. It\nshould be noted that the plasma itself is not switched ON and\nOFF as the supply is driven, rather the cluster composition of\nthe plasma changes because of the differing stabilities of the\nclusters present as the applied power is pulsed on and off.\nFigure 3~b! shows typical examples of how the on\/off ratio\ninfluences the plasma contents, and Fig. 3~b3! gives the full\nmass spectrum of the adamantane molecule fragmented un-\nder 70 eV electron energy impact, exhibiting clusters over\nthe fragmentation range scanned. In this particular case, the\nFIG. 2.

Figures 3~b1! and 3~b2!, in\nturn, show the diagnostic mass spectra obtained running the\nplasma in the pulse mode, with 150\/50 and 50\/150 \u2018\u2018on\/off\u2019\u2019\nduty cycles, respectively. It is clear that the 150\/50 ratio\ngives predominantly low mass clusters, notably 26 ~and the\nargon ion at mass 40!. The shorter the plasma \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 period,\nfor example 50 ms \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 and 150 ms \u2018\u2018off,\u2019\u2019 the higher cluster\nmasses appear. This is illustrated in Fig. 3~b2!, with masses\nat 26, 41, 53, 67, 79, 93 and, now mostly, at 136. Higher\nmasses are clearly more abundant in Fig. 3~b2!, as opposed\nto their relatively low abundances in Fig. 3~b1!.\nIn addition, Fig. 4 shows the fragmentation ratio on\nN2\n1\/N1 as a function of the duty cycle where the \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 time\nvaries from 20 to 200 ms. Note that above 40 ms the N2\n1\/N1\nratio increases with the \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 time, whereas below 40 ms the\nrelative intensity of the N1 fragment is greater than that of\nFIG. 3.

By controlling the duty cycle of the plasma, we\nnow have a means of fixing the N2\n1\/N1 ratio during growth\nof DAC films and thereby allowing a better understanding of\nthe growth mechanism.\nB. Plasma diagnostics\nAll the electrical data extracted using the Langmuir\nprobe were measured under 100 ms duty cycles ~a! from a\nnitrogen plasma ~30 mTorr, 200 W, and on\/off 5 50\/50 ms!\nfor the eed only and ~b! from an argon plasma ~50 mTorr, 50\nW with the \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 time varying from 20 to 80 ms! for kTe ,\nVp , V f , Ne , and Ni . The latter parameters were measured at\n20 ms into the rf \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 time because the rf power supply\ntakes ;10 ms to stabilize to the set. The eed functions were\ncollected at 52 ms ~just before the power switched off! and at\n57 ms ~after the plasma has stabilized post rf switch off!, in\na 50\/50 ms on\/off sequence. The results of the plasma diag-\nnostics are given in Fig. 5, showing that kTe , Vp , and V f are\nfunctions of the on\/off ratio. It also indicates that as the \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019\nincreases, more energy is coupled into the plasma which\ntransforms itself into plasma temperature @Fig. 5~a!#. Similar\nbehavior is observed for Ne and Ni with Ni.Ne , @Fig. 5~b!#\nsuggesting that the electrons are lost in the plasma faster than\nions at the end of each \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 time.12 The eed measured at 52\nand 57 ms trigger positions also exhibit clear differences, as\nexpected @Fig. 5~c!#. Finally, the electrical characteristics of\nthe plasma, under given conditions, such as power level, gas\npressure, and makeup, can be monitored by pulsing the\nplasma at user-defined on\/off regimes and data sampling po-\nsitions.

However, small differences\nare present. For instance, 150\/50 ratio films show a slightly\nbroader band with a nominal width at half maximum of 1.8\neV against 1.7 eV for that from the 50\/150 regime. Addition-\nally, the amount of oxygen present ~via XPS survey scans! at\nthe surface of these films is relatively higher in the 150\/50\nregime at ;12 at. % against ;2 at. % for the 50\/150 case.\nThis is probably related to the difference in the energy gen-\nerated by the two regimes, whereby higher energy in the\nplasma generates relatively porous structures.

Redistribution subject to AIP lThe second set ~D03\u2013D05 and D08\u2013 D13! of specimens\nrefers to the samples containing nitrogen deposited under the\nvaried duty cycles above in Table I. Initially, samples depos-\nited under switched on\/off regimes of 50\/150 and 150\/50 ms\nare considered. XPS analysis of the specimens deposited un-\nder these regimes now show significant differences, as listed\nin Table I. Generally, these are identified in terms of atomic\nconcentration, envelope shapes, and chemical shifts resulting\nsolely from the change of the on\/off ratio. Specimens depos-\nited under a 50\/150 on\/off ratio show very little oxygen at\nthe surface ~2\u20136 at. %!, whereas those deposited at 150\/50\ncontain more oxygen ~3\u201314 at. %! as in the previous non-\nnitrogenated samples. Assuming the oxygen level is due to\nsuperficial contamination and since the experiments were\ncarried out under similar quality vacuum conditions ~cham-\nber base pressure 1029 Torr!, these oxygen levels in the films\nsuggest that samples deposited at 150\/50 are apparently more\nlikely to absorb or accept oxygen at the outmost layers than\nare the 50\/150 films. Comparison of Table I~a! and ~b! also\nshows differences in terms of the carbon and nitrogen\npresent in these films. Very little nitrogen is found in the\nsamples deposited at a 50\/150 ratio @7\u201310 at. %, Table I~a!#,\nwhereas, in those grown under 150\/50 significantly more ni-\ntrogen is found @17\u201330 at. %, Table I~b!#. These differences\nin both N and O may probably be due to a similar reason and\nrelated to the uptake of \u2018\u2018impurities\u2019\u2019 by DAC films by virtue\nof its porous microstructure controlled by the energy of the\ndepositing species.\nTable I~a! and ~b! also summarizes the nominal width at\nhalf maximum of the XPS C 1s envelopes as a function of\nthe atomic concentration. The specimens grown at a 50\/150\non\/off ratio present narrower, more symmetrical, regular\nband profiles, with the peak positions remaining identical\n@Fig. 6~a!#. The width of C 1s envelope varies from 1.7 eV\nfor the DAC-type samples to 2.0 eV for the nitrogen contain-\ning specimens @Table I~b!#. In turn, samples deposited under\na 150\/50 regime give widths of 1.7\u20131.8 eV for the DAC-type\nfilms ~similar to the previous set! and of 2.5\u20133.0 eV, as func-\ntion of nitrogen level for the nitrogen containing samples. As\nexpected, the latter set of samples show broader and non-\nsymmetrical band shapes as the nitrogen level increases in\nthe films @Fig. 6~a!, Table I~b!#. The superposition of Figs.\n6~a! and 6~b! indicate identical band positions for the DAC-\ntype sample regardless of the on\/off ratio used. In turn, a\nslight chemical shift ~;0\u20131 eV! appears in the nitrogen-\ncontaining films when the on\/off ratio is varied from 50\/150\nto 150\/50 ms. This shift increases with an increasing nitrogen\nlevel in the films, likewise associated with the increasing\nband asymmetry.18 This suggests the presence of C\u2013N,\nC5N, and C[N components but also a possible formation\nof polymeric structures.19\nGiven the role of the on\/off ratio in determining the\nplasma contents, Fig. 6, as well as the deposition process,\nanother set of experiments was carried out to confirm and\nqualify the earlier results presented above, i.e., that the\natomic abundance is a function of the on\/off ratio. Three\nseries of samples were deposited under 180\/20, 20\/180, and\n100\/100 ms on\/off ratios. Representative results are summa-\nrized in Table I~c! and Fig. 6~c!.

The oxygen contents remain at\na contamination level ;3 at. % in this set but the nitrogen\nconcentration rises to ;38 at. % for the highest \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 period\n~180\/20 ms! and is the lowest at ;4 at. % for the reverse\nregime ~20\/180 ms!, with the C 1s envelope widths at half\nmaximum 3.3 and 1.9 eV, respectively. The 100\/100 regime\ndata further confirm expectation, with the nitrogen present in\nthe resulting films at ;25 at. %, with 2.7 eV for the C 1s\nbandwidth at half maximum showing a regular and sym-\nmetrical shape. It can be concluded, therefore, that the longer\nthe power pulse stays on the more nitrogen is present in the\nfilms derived from a N2\/C10H16 mixture. The opposite is also\ntrue in the sense that the nitrogen level in the films is lower\nif the power is switched on for a significantly shorter period\nFIG. 6.

Referring to the data presented in Fig.\n4, showing a high abundance of N2\n1 at the longer \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 pe-\nriods, one can assume that N2\n1 plays a significant role in the\nformation of CxNyHz compounds, although additional data\nmay be required before a final conclusion is drawn on the\nincorporation of nitrogen in hydrogenated amorphous carbon\nmatrix.

Clearly, the operating duty cycle\nand the on\/off ratio are significant factors unequivocally in-\nfluencing the contribution of sp\/sp2\/sp3 fractions to the\nC 1s and N 1s envelope. Figures 7~a! and 7~b! show that the\nintensity of the band at 284.5 eV increases as the \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 pe-\nriod decreases, giving C 1s centered at 285 eV and N 1s cen-\ntered at 398 eV, indicative of amorphouslike-films. It is\ntherefore reasonable to argue in agreement with those\nreports20,21 that establish a direct link between carbon clus-\nters and the properties of the corresponding deposited films.\nIn order to obtain additional structural information, contact\nangle measurements again were carried out.\nD. Contact angle measurements\nContact angle ~u! measurements were performed on the\nsame specimens in order to investigate possible structural or\ncompositional differences on the film surfaces, reflected in\nchanges in their surface energies as a result of the changes in\nthe on\/off ratio. A blank silicon wafer giving u549\u00b0 ~distilled\nwater, 18 \u00b0C! is taken as a reference. The results are listed in\nTable I. Again DAC-type and nitrogen-containing samples\nare considered. The DAC-type specimens give a very high\ncontact angle ~u.70\u00b0! regardless of the on\/off ratio used for\ndeposition. In turn, nitrogen-containing samples show vary-\ning contact angle data depending on the duty cycle. Although\nDAC-type specimens all show high measured contact angles,\nsome differences do occur. Indeed, comparison of the contact\nangles associated with the on\/off ratios used indicates that\nclear differences exist. For instance, DAC-type films grown\nunder a 150\/50 ratio give u570\u00b0, whereas those grown un-\nder a 50\/150 on\/off regime give u580\u00b0, suggesting en-\nhanced tribological properties22 may be present in these\ncases, i.e., a low surface energy improves lubrication of an\novercoat layer and reduces friction when used as a hard disk\ncoating. Indeed, surface energy, contact angle, and lubrica-\ntion are linked together 23,24 and are of importance in\nmagnetic storage technology. One aspect of pulsing the\nplasma in the context of film growth which is of interest is to\ncontrol the resultant contact angle of the surfaces produced,\nleading for example to the use of much thinner lubricant\nlayers when the film surface energy is very low. However, it\nshould be noted that such high values in the contact angle\nmay be indicative of smoother, flatter, and pin hole free films\nbut could also suggest the presence of either a more amor-\nphous or polymer-like with low hardness.\nThe XPS data shows that all samples deposited under a\n50\/150 ms on\/off ratio contain relatively little nitrogen. The\ncorresponding contact angles are relatively high ~u.70\u00b0!,\nsimilar to those shown by the hydrogenated DAC-type speci-\nmens. The contact angles resulting from samples grown un-\nder a 150\/50 ratio appear to depend on the nitrogen content,\ngiving the highest value at 67\u00b0, with ;17 at. % nitrogen and\n;13 at. % oxygen present in the film. As the nitrogen content\nincreases a significant decrease in the contact angle takes\nplace. For instance, the contact angle decreases to 41\u00b0 when\nthe nitrogen content increases to ;30 at. %, with ;3 at. %loaded 19 Oct 2010 to 131.227.178.158. Redistribution subject to AIP loxygen. Note that the contact angles for samples D09\u2013 10 sta-\nbilize at a relatively low value although the initial value is\nhigh. Figure 8 illustrates a typical example with the water\ndroplet spreading across the surface. 40 different frames\nwere recorded at 1 s intervals. The contact angle is observed\nto decrease rapidly in the first few seconds then more slowly\nuntil a stable value is reached. The droplet ~5 ml! was found\nto stabilize after ;15 s to give u in the 65\u00b0\u201340\u00b0 range for\nnitrogenated specimens grown under a 150\/50 on\/off regime.\nIn contrast, those grown under a 50\/150 ratio conditions gave\na near stable droplet behavior almost immediately, enabling\nrepeated and near identical contact angle measurements to be\nmade over extended periods of time ~evaporation effects are\ndiscounted!. These differences may be indicative of the sur-\nface stability or short-term instability, surface polarity of the\nfilms concerned but at some extent strongly suggest the pres-\nence of porous structures in the films.\nOn the basis of the XPS results obtained and the contact\nangle measurements, further measurements were performed\non samples D11\u2013 12 grown under the conditions described ear-\nlier. As the nitrogen level increases to ;38.5 at. % ~D11 ,\n180\/20 on\/off ratio!, the contact angle decreases significantly\nto 34\u00b0, following the trend already illustrated in Fig. 8. As\nexpected, specimen D12 gave straightforward and stable con-\ntact angle data at ;77\u00b0, consistent with the results presented\nin Table I~a!. Specimen D13 , grown under a 100\/100 ms duty\ncycle, gives a stable contact angle ~64\u00b0! which was measured\nover an extended period. Additionally, this sample contains\n;25 at. % nitrogen and ;3 at. % oxygen, suggesting that a\nstable surface sample, offering good tribological properties,\ncan be prepared by controlling the growth parameters care-\nfully. The decrease in the contact angle cannot be attributed\nonly to the presence of nitrogen since a high contact angle\nsurface can be produced, providing an appropriate on\/off re-\ngime is used for film deposition, i.e., structural, as well as\ncompositional effects need to be considered.\nE. Optical data\nOptical refractive index measurements performed on the\nsamples are shown in Table II. Specimens in Table II were\nselected to be a consistent representation of the various on\/\noff regimes used.

Generally, the thickness should\nnot affect the refractive index unless ultrathin films are con-\nsidered. However, films with low refractive index exhibit a\nwider band gap while a narrow band gap is associated with a\nhigher refractive index.25 The films are transparent and there-\nfore we expect them to exhibit a relatively high refractive\nindex ~1.9\u20132.6! as shown in Table II. It is believed that ni-\ntrogen incorporation in amorphous carbon films helps to pro-\nmote the formation of sp2 bonds followed by an increase in\nthe refractive index and a decrease of the optical band gap as\nthe film becomes more graphiticlike. The results presented\nhere agree with those reported in the literature,26 which show\na clear decrease of the optical band gap as the nitrogen con-\ncentration increases, suggesting an increase of refractive in-\ndex as seen in Table II. These results once again indicate that\noptical properties of the amorphous carbon films can be con-\ntrolled using appropriate pulse regimes, consistent with our\nearlier results regarding the surface chemistry, the structural,\nelectrical, and tribological properties.\nF. General discussion\nBadyal et al.27 recently underlined the interest in the\n\u2018\u2018smart surfaces\u2019\u201928 by control of the deposition plasma. Puls-\ning a plasma has proved to be an efficient technique in sur-\nface polymerization29 processes and for enhancing adhesive\ntreatment, appearing to allow better control of the desired\nsurface properties. In a number of ways, the results presented\nin this article are in agreement with the work of Badyal,27\nHutton et al.,28 and Ryan et al.29 while opening new applica-\ntion potential in thin film deposition for control of surface\nstructure, morphology, and properties via a pulsed plasma.\nBy adjusting the sp2\/sp3 ratio, optical, electronic,30 and tri-\nbological properties31 of DAC-type carbons can be modified\nat will.

Redistribution subject to AIP lIV. CONCLUSION\nIt has been demonstrated that hydrocarbon clusters, de-\nrived from the hydrocarbon C10H16 , can be produced in an\ninductively coupled plasma and their size and relative abun-\ndances controlled, by choosing carefully the power on\/off\nratios for a fixed duty cycle generated by an adjustable\nswitching unit in the driving rf supply. Mass-energy diagnos-\ntics show that smaller-sized clusters are produced when the\nplasma is switched on longer for the chosen duty cycle ~200\nms in the current study!, whereas the opposite on\/off regime\nwill produce larger-sized clusters preferentially. Langmuir\nprobe diagnostic data from the plasmas indicate that the elec-\ntrical characteristics observed are affected strongly by the\nexperimental conditions, notably by the on\/off switching re-\ngime and by the position of the trigger signal initiating data\ncollection.\nPostdeposition XPS data of the specimens grown under\nthe duty cycles ~50\/150, 150\/50, 20\/180, 180\/20, and 100\/\n100 ms! clearly indicate that the samples grown at shorter on\nperiods contain very little nitrogen ~up to 10 at. %! and the\noxygen remains at a superficial contamination level ~2\u20136\nat. %!. The C 1s envelopes of these specimens show a regular\nshape and narrow envelope widths at half maximum ~1.7\u2013\n2.0 eV!. In turn, specimens grown under longer \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 periods\ngive broader envelopes ~widths at half maximum51.8\u20133.3\neV, depending on the gas mixtures used for deposition! with\nasymmetrical band shapes. The latter regimes are favorable\nto a higher incorporation of nitrogen in the films ~;38.5\nat. % for samples deposited under a 180\/20 ms on\/off ratio!\nwhile the oxygen content is slightly higher ~;3\u201312 at. %!,\nalthough still at the contamination level. Specimens grown\nunder 50\/150, 20\/180 ms regimes gave high contact angles\n~u570\u00b0\u201384\u00b0!, suggesting low surface energy with possibly\nbetter lubricant properties and low friction, as a result. In\ncontrast, specimens deposited under the reverse ratios\n~150\/50 and 180\/20 ms! showed low contact angles, suggest-\ning poorer tribological properties for such films. The signifi-\ncant decrease of the contact angle may be affected by any\nsurface texture present. In these circumstances the possible\nporosity of the surface should be also considered. Finally, the\ncombination of data derived from both XPS and contact\nangle measurements are consistent and suggest clear differ-\nences in the morphology ~now under investigation!, the sta-\nbility, porosity, and polarity of such surfaces. Deposition de-\npendent differences in the surface features of the processed\nfilms were further confirmed by the optical data showing\nlower refractive index and faster growth rate in the condi-\ntions described. The methodology used is now being refined\nand extended to other molecular precursors.icense or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/about\/rights_and_permissions\n1827J. Appl.
