INTRODUCTION \nLet C be a linear q-ary code of dimension k and length n. \nThe weight u(S)  of a subcode S & C, is the number of posi- \ntions where at least one word in S differs from zero. The r th  \ngeneralised Hamming weight d,  of C is the least weight of an \nr-dimensional subcode of c. The sequence ( d l ,  dz, . . . , dk) is \ncalled the weight hierarchy of C [SI. \nbk-2 5 2k-361 - 2 - 2k-3. \nTheorem 3 (Total Value) If (&I,&,. . . ,&-I), k 2 3 Es an \nENDS, then . 11.

By permuting \ncolumns of G or by multiplying certain columns by non-zero \nscalars, we get an equivalent code. Equivalent codes have the \nsame weight hierarchy. \nLet PG(k-1, q )  be the projective (k-1)-space over the finite \nfield with 9 elements. The code C is determined up to equiv- \nalence by giving the map y : PG(k - l ,9 )  -+ {0,1,. . .}, saying \nhow many times each projective point occurs as a column in \nG. Such a map is called a projective multiset [2], a projective \nsystem [5], or a value assignment (1, 41. The definition of y is \nextended by y(S) = C s E S - y ( ~ )  for all S C PG(k - 1,9). The \nWe know [3 ,5]  that a subcode Dr of dimension r and weight \nw ,  corresponds to a subspace S, PG(k - 1, q)  of dimension \nk - T - 1 and value -y(S,) = n - w. Hence a subcode Dr \nof minimum value corresponds to a projective subspace S, of \nmaximum value. Also if Dr C D,), then S, 2 S,.,. \nThe difference sequence (60, 61,. . . , & - I )  is defined by 6, = \nd k - 1  - d k - l - % .  The difference sequence is easily computed \nfrom the weight hierarchy and vice versa. If S is an i-space \nof maximum value, then y(S) = 60 + 61 + . . . + 6,. A differ- \nence sequence corresponding to  an extremal non-chain code is \ncalled an ENDS (Extrema1 Nonchain Difference Sequence). \nPI \n121 \n131 \nnumber y(S) is called the value of S.
