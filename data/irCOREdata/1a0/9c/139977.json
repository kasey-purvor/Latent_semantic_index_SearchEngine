The version of Z-Fiber\u00ae used here is a cured \npultruded carbon fibre\/bismaleimide rod.  Initially the pins inserted in the foam extend \nbeyond each surface of the foam, for a so called \u201creveal length\u201d. The core at this stage is \ncalled a X-CorTM preform (see Fig.1a).  For the X-CorTM sandwich construction this \npreform is then pressed between two uncured composite skins, the pins enter into the \nsurfacing prepreg plies and create a mechanical fastening between the core and the skin, \nwithout the need for any adhesive (see Fig.1b).  \nIn the case of the K-Cor\u2122 preforms, the Z-pins which extend beyond the foam surface \nare only partially cured. They can therefore be folded back under the action of moderate \nheat and pressure, flush with the foam surface (see Fig.2). The required sandwich panel \nskins, which can be pre-cured composite or metallic plates, are then usually adhesively \nbonded onto the core. The additional heat supplied in the bonding process serves to \ncomplete the cure of the Z-pins. Further detail of the manufacturing processes involved \nin the production of the preforms can be found in a recent review [1]. The possibility of \nproducing these preforms to net shapes and required pinning densities is attractive \nwhere complex sandwich construction is required [2]. The Rohacell\u00ae foam is a \u2018closed \ncell\u2019 type and is highly resistant to ingress by water.  This confers a clear advantage to \nthese sandwich panels in situations where water absorption and freeze-thaw cycles may \notherwise present a problem.   \n \nOut-of-plane properties of sandwich panels  \nRelatively little experimental work has been carried out so far on the above described \nnovel sandwich materials. The earliest published work by Vaidya and colleagues was \nprompted by considerations of whether these new materials could completely replace \ntraditional honeycomb sandwich materials in aerospace applications and consequently it \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 3\nconcentrated on their resistance to impact loading and compression after impact [3 - 6]. \nThe basic conclusion was that the mechanical properties studied were strongly \ninfluenced by the angle at which the pins had been inserted into the foam core, with an \nangle of 10\u00b0 exhibiting better in out-of-plane indentation resistance than equivalent \nsamples with insertion angle of 20\u00b0.  In a later study O\u2019Brien and Paris found the \nstrength of the bond between the core and the skins to be the limiting factor under \nuniaxial tension, three-point bending and combined tension and bending loading \nconditions [7]. The work reported here was carried out in the context of considering a \nwide spectrum of applications for these sandwich structures; automotive and naval as \nwell as aerospace.  For this reason the emphasis was placed on obtaining basic quasi-\nstatic properties in the first instance and on their comparison to the response of Nomex \nhoneycomb panels under equivalent modes of loading. \nData on the out-of-plane properties of a sandwich construction or of a type of core are \nrequired for design purposes. A sandwich structure is usually designed to bear out-of-\nplane shear stresses caused by bending moments acting on the skins. The overall \nbending deformation is dominated by the deformation of the skins while the core \nstabilises the faces against global and local buckling. \nThe out-of-plane tension test characterises primarily the strength of the core-skin \ninterface. The out-of-plane shear test characterises the core behaviour as a part of the \nwhole sandwich structure, as the skins play a minor part under this loading condition. \nThe out-of-plane compression test determines the compression stiffness and strength of \nthe core.  It would be expected that the mechanical properties of the X\/K-Cor\u2122 \nproducts are mainly influenced by the Z-pin densities used, the pin insertion angle and \nthe pin lay-out in the core. The angle of the pins in the truss will alter the balance \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 4\nbetween the shear and compression properties [1-2]. The testing reported here was \ncarried out to explore and quantify this balance. \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nTable 1 summarises the types of cores used in the study, together with their relevant \nattributes. The \u2018hollow\u2019 X-Cor and K-Cor were obtained by chemically removing the \nRohacell foam, by a process which does not affect the Z-pins.  These hollow cores were \nthen combined with 6-ply skins of IM7 tape, prepregged with 8552 resin, in quasi-\nisotropic lay-up configuration, and cured to a nominal final skin thickness of 0.75mm. \nThe film adhesive used to co-cure the prepreg skins onto K-Cor preform was Redux 322 \nand a 180\u00b0 C cure with a 120\u00b0 C dwell was used. \nIn the tests in which the sandwich specimen facings were required to be bonded to other \nmetal parts the adhesive used was Redux 420A Araldite and the best performance was \nobtained for 150 minute cure at 70\u00b0C under slight pressure. The surfaces to be glued \nwere abraded with sandpaper and cleaned with acetone. \n \nOut-of-plane tension test  \nThe test was carried out according to ASTM C297 standard, the load being transmitted \nto the sandwich through thick loading blocks bonded to the sandwich skins. These \nloading blocks must be sufficiently stiff to keep the bonded facings flat under load. \nAccurate alignment of the specimen and of the fixtures is critical. The schematic of the \ntest setup is shown in Fig.3. The tests were carried out at a constant crosshead speed of \n0.5mm\/min.  Failure of the bond between the loading blocks and the facings is not \nconsidered a valid failure for the purpose of this test.  \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 5\nThe out-of-plane tensile stress \u03c3  is calculated by dividing the load P  by the effective \narea of the specimen Aeff  for the pinned cores (see Results and Discussion section) or by \nthe original cross-sectional area for the Nomex.  The elastic modulus is determined from \nthe slope of the linear elastic portion of the load-extension curve.  All the results \npresented here have been corrected for the compliance of the test machine and of the \nfixtures. \n \nOut-of-plane shear test \nThe test method used, ASTM C 273, allows the determination of shear properties of \nsandwich constructions or cores, associated with shear distortion of planes parallel to \nthe facings. As for other shear tests developed in recent years the objective is to \nmaximise shear stress and minimise extraneous induced stresses in the specimen [8]. \nThe test configuration does not produce a pure shear stress state in the specimen, but the \nspecimen geometry is prescribed so as to minimise secondary stresses [9]. The test can \nbe conducted on a core bonded directly to the loading plates or on the sandwich with its \nskins bonded to the plates. For the pinned cores the presence of the skins is necessary to \nguarantee representative constraint at pin ends.  Fig.4 shows the fixture with all the \nmain parts labelled. According to the test protocol the specimen should have a thickness \nequal to the thickness of the sandwich and a width not less than 50mm. The requirement \non the length in order to minimize secondary stresses is to be at least 12 times the \nthickness and having the line of action of the direct tensile force passing through the \ndiagonally opposite corners of the sandwich, as shown in Fig.4. The nominal \ndimensions chosen for the specimen are listed in Table 2.  \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 6\nThe load is applied at the ends of the rigid plates so as to distribute the load uniformly \nacross the width of the specimen. According to reference [11], the shear strain is \napproximately uniform in the central part of the specimen, but it starts to decrease at a \nlength of about one half of the core thickness from the free edges, where it becomes \nzero.   The constant rate of movement of the cross head was set at 0.5mm\/min. The \ntensile shear plates are attached to the loading fixture with bolts. The relative \ndisplacements between the steel plates in both the longitudinal and the transversal \ndirections were measured by two LVDTs positioned as close as possible to the centre \nlines of the specimen in order to limit the influence of the plate bending on the results \n[9]. \n \nThe shear stress \u03c4 is calculated by dividing the load P by the effective area Aeff.  For the \nNomex specimens the effective area is simply the product of the length and the width of \nthe specimen. The shear strain \u03b3  and the shear modulus CG  of the sandwich are \ncalculated through: \n \nCt\n\u03b4\u03b3 =   \n \nC\nC\neff\nPtG\nA\n\u03c4\n\u03b3 \u03b4= =  \n \n \nwhere \u03b4  is the displacement or movement of one loading plate of the specimen with \nrespect to the other, measured with an LVDT (see Fig. 4), Ct  the thickness of the \nspecimen and CG  is evaluated as the slope of the initial linear elastic portion of the \n\u03c4 \u03b3\u2212  curve. \n \n(1)\n(2)\nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 7\nOut-of-plane compression test  \nThis test, performed according to the ASTM C365 standard, is used to determine the \nout-of-plane compressive strength and modulus and to investigate the failure \nmechanisms under this loading condition for a sandwich core. The quasi-static \ncompression tests were conducted at a constant cross head speed of 0.5mm\/min \n(corresponding to a nominal strain rate of 10-4s-1) on sandwich specimens of nominal \ndimensions 40 x 40 mm. \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \nData analysis method for Z-pinned cores: load-bearing pin approach \nThe determination of the effective cross-section area of the specimen Aeff, which is used \nin the calculations of the out-of-plane stresses and moduli, is based on the actual \nnumber of load-bearing pins in each sample. A similar approach discounts any pins \nwhich are damaged and not correctly fastened to both skins from the calculation [12]. \nSuch pins are usually found at the edges of the specimens (see Fig.5). The theoretical \nareal pin density \u03c1th represents the theoretical number of load-bearing pins in a unit area \nand is determined as follows: \nth\nth\nnom\nN\nA\n\u03c1 =   \n \nHere Nth is the number of Z-pins expected to be present in a given area Anom of perfect \ncore, based on the manufacturer\u2019s specification.  The effective pin areal density \u03c1eff is \ndetermined experimentally by identifying the effective load bearing pins Neff contained \nwithin the same nominal area Anom:  \n \n(3)\nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 8\neff\neff\nnom\nN\nA\n\u03c1 =   \n \n(NB. The value of Neff is determined by visual inspection of the specimen, discounting \nthose pins not spanning across the two faces).   \nThe effective area is then determined as follows: \nnom eff\neff\nth\nA\nA\n\u03c1\n\u03c1=  \n \n \nThe theoretical and effective pin densities for the specimens used are summarised in \nTable 2, indicating the extent of the edge effect in the different cases.  Any edge effects \nin Nomex specimens are expected to be low enough to be neglected. \n \nAll the stress-strain curves presented, together with the values for strength and moduli, \nrepresent the material response based on a five test average, for each case considered. \nThe tests were all displacement controlled. \n \nOut-of plane tension test results  \nFigure 6 shows examples of stress-strain curves for Nomex, K-Cor (30\u00b0 pin angle) and \nX-Cor (22\u00b0 pin angle) samples. The values for tensile strength and modulus obtained for \nthe different types of sandwich are summarised in Table 3. There is relatively little \ndifference between the modulus values of the K-Cor and X-Cor samples; both cases are \nabove those measured for the Nomex samples. Measurements of the tensile strength, \nhowever, provide a much greater differentiation between the different materials. As \nmight be expected, the strength of the X-Cor with the 22\u00b0 pin angle is higher than that \n(4)\n(5)\nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 9\nof 30\u00b0 pin angle X-Cor. For a fixed inclination of the pins (30\u00b0), the K-Cor exhibits \nsuperior performance to X-Cor under this mode of loading.   \n \nThe observed differences in the absolute values of strength are accompanied by \ndifferences in the mechanisms of failure. In the case of Nomex the failure takes place \nonly in the core as the cell walls of the honeycomb fail in tension (Fig 7a).  For the \npinned cores the skin-core interface is the critical part where the specimen fails. The \nstrength of the X-Cor structures depends primarily on the ability of the pin to resist pull-\nout from the skin (Fig.7b). In the case of the K-Cor structures, there are two principal \nskin-core bond mechanisms: - foam to skin bond and separate multiple bonds between \nthe flattened pin surface and the skin (Fig.7c).  It seems that this combination enhances \nthe strength of K-Cor compared to X-Cor, nearly to the value obtained from the Nomex \nsamples.  \n \nOut-of-plane shear test results  \nExamples of representative stress-strain curves obtained from shear loaded X-Cor, K-\nCor and Nomex panels are shown in Fig.8 and the averaged test results are summarised \nin Table 4. Direct comparison of X-Cor and K-Cor specimens containing pins inclined \nat 30\u00b0 shows that the main difference between the two core systems is the shear \nmodulus: - for the same core and skin attributes the X-Cor is nearly twice as stiff as the \nK-Cor.  Both are considerably stiffer that the Nomex panels. The K-Cor also exhibits a \nhigher value of shear strength than the X-Cor, but the shear strength of the Nomex panel \nis almost double the best performance available from the Z-pinned core panels.  The \nsuperior energy absorbing characteristics of the Nomex are evident from the stress-\nstrain curves. \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 10\nThe failure mechanisms of these different samples under shear loading are illustrated in \nFigs. 9a-c. For the pinned cores the dominant mode of failure is that of the core-skin \ninterface, while for the Nomex specimens the failure is determined by the shear \nbuckling of the honeycomb cell walls. For both X-Cor and K-Cor samples some Z-pin \ntip rotation is observed during the shear loading, accompanied by an incremental \nopening of the specimen.  The other coexistent failure mechanism is pin pull out from \nthe skin for the X-Cor and pin de-bond from the skin for the K-Cor specimen. However, \nin the case of the K-Cor, a shear failure of the foam is reached before the final failure. \nShear cracks in the foam are clearly visible in Fig. 9a. This would suggest that the \nseparate multiple bonds between the flattened pin surfaces and the skin in the K-Cor are \nstronger than the embedded pins, under shear loading.  \n The role of the foam in the X-Cor was investigated by out-of-plane shear tests on both \nstandard X-Cor and hollow X-Cor characterised by a 22\u00b0 pin angle and 0.5mm Z-pin \ndiameter (see Tables 1 and 4 and Fig.10) and proved to be negligible.  The shear \nstrength of the foam alone was found to be about 0.4MPa.  This value corresponds to \nthe post-failure plateau in the stress-strain curve of the K-Cor, shown in Fig.8. \n \nOut-of-plane compression test results  \nThe role of the foam was investigated further, by subjecting hollow K-Cor and hollow \nX-Cor samples to compression. Unlike in shear, the role of the foam in now non-\nnegligible, especially in the K-Cor (see Fig. 11 and Table 5).  This is not particularly \nsurprising [13], as the foam is likely to act by delaying the pin buckling failure which \nwould otherwise occur in unsupported pins subjected to compression \u2013 see Fig.12. The \nbehaviour exhibited by both the X\/K-Cor and by the X\/K-Cor without foam is \nindicative of a buckling failure mechanism, observed in the testing and confirmed by \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 11\nthe stress-strains diagrams. After an initial linear increase in the stress, there is a fairly \nsharp drop, followed by a collapse regime.  As with the other modes of mechanical \nloading, Nomex exhibits higher strength but lower stiffness than the pin core sandwich \npanels.   \n \nCONCLUSIONS  \nFor the set of materials used in this early study, manufacturing procedures and the range \nof test configurations employed, Nomex honeycomb sandwich panels outperformed the \npinned-core sandwich panels in terms of ultimate strength. However, when the \nsandwich panel stiffness is the key design parameter, the choice of a pinned core would \nbe appropriate.  In a real application, the choice of core may also be influenced by the \npossible advantage of having a water ingress resistant foam core instead of a \nhoneycomb core.  If the absolute weight is the overriding issue, for the configuration of \nthe X-Cor sandwich panels tested, the Rohacell foam may be removed without a \nsignificant performance penalty, except for situations where compressive loads are \nlikely to occur.  The potential weight saving by foam removal can be close to 50%. \n \nFrom the above presented mechanical property data and failure investigations it would \nappear that the way in which the Z-pins anchor into the sandwich skins and how these \npins tips react to applied stresses, is the critical failure determining factor.   The failure \nprocesses are characterised by pin pull-out (in X-Cor), pin end debond (K-Cor) and, in \nshear, rotation of those pins which are opposed to the loading direction. It is the \nmovement of these pin tips which determines the extent of the opening of the specimen \nduring shear loading. \n \nSubmitted to Composites Part A \u2013 revision March 2005  \n \n 12\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe work was carried out through an EPSRC grant (GR\/ R94305), aided by gift of raw \nmaterials from Aztex Inc.
