High levels of power efficiency can be achieved with the use of the IEEE 802.15.4\nprotocol for communication between the motes, allowing long-term periods of operation for motes and reducing the power\nrequirements of a spacecraft. The article examines the feasibility of using sensors for harness reduction between satellite\nsubsystems, and for inter-satellite networking capabilities between satellite swarms.\nKeywords: Satellite communication onboard systems; satellite communication; satellite vehicle power systems;\ninterconnections; wireless LAN; sensors\n1. Introduction\nSpacecraft manufacturing is largely a manual operation, with\nhigh costs and long lead times. Hamessing or electrical inter-\nconnections form a large part of the spacecraft, contributing mass\nand requiring more assembly, integration, and testing as spacecraft\ncomplexity increases. Having hamessing account for more than\n10% of the platform cost and up to 15% of the dry mass are com-\nmon fractions in spacecraft manufacturing and design. Small\nspacecraft use a plug-and-play CAN bus data architecture, offering\nIEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, Vol. 48, No. 5, October 2006\ncost savings through standardized cards and interfacing, against\nhigher-mass point-to-point connections used in large spacecraft.\nSensor networks developed for the terrestrial industry can be\nphysically arranged or arranged in an ad hoc fashion using new\nwireless protocols, such as the ZigBee, which can self-organize\ninto a communicating network [1].\nSpacecraft platforms are highly complex systems. Hamess\nand electrical interconnections of spacecraft components require a\nhigh level of assembly integration and testing. The use of wireless\nmonitoring nodes can potentially minimize the use of wires, with\n175\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Several industries use wireless sensor devices (motes) to\nmonitor automotive subsystems, control lighting, and monitor\nmovement for security systems. Such sensors can form a mesh, or\ncan form point-to-point ad-hoc networks [ 1, 2].\nMotes are wireless micro-sensors that combine a low-power\nmicro controller, an RF transceiver, and power supply with one or\nmore attached or embedded sensors. They often use eight-bit\nmicrocontrollers, and have a few kilobytes of onboard flash mem-\nory to store the program used from the mote.\nMotes are being researched for intra-spacecraft communica-\ntion, to replace wires between spacecraft subsystems, and for inter-\nspacecraft communication, offering communication among space-\ncraft flying in formation or as an ad-hoc swarm. Onboard computer\nfunctions, such as housekeeping sensor readings, could be replaced\nby mote networks, which can also support data routing from other\nsubsystems.\nLow-cost small satellites use the CAN (Control Area Net-\nwork) protocol to provide a communication link among different\nsubsystems. Although CAN has been tested on previous satellite\nmissions and is proven to perform very well, it has a limited data\nrate and comes with a hamess overhead. Hamess reduction can\nresult in a reduction in complexity for construction of a spacecraft,\nas well as in a sizeable reduction in the total mass, especially for\nsmall spacecraft. Further mass reduction can occur due to elimina-\ntion of electronic interference boards on subsystem electronics. For\nexample, a CAN interface for a star tracker or a battery-charge\nregulator has a mass of 100-200 g. By using a MICA2DOT [3]\nwireless micro-sensor, the mass could be reduced to 10 g, includ-\ning the battery cell (Figure 1). The data rate of CAN is limited to\n32 kbps, but the MICA2DOT has a higher baud rate of 38.4 kbps,\nwith a fraction of the mass. Motes using directional antennas have\nthe capability to transmit up to 250 kbps and have a mass of less\nthan 30 g, excluding the battery. Using a mesh topology of motes\ninside a satellite, we could create a robust network with almost\nzero hamess.\nFor power- and mass-limited satellites - such as the Surrey\n1 kg Palmsat spacecraft [4] - cooperative clusters of the spacecraft\ncan form a low-power, low-cost, robust data-handling solution. In\nthe case of several satellites flying in formation, a \"communication\nweb\" will be formed, which offers efficient communication among\nthe satellites.\n2. Small Satellite Requirements\nSuch networks have specific requirements in order to be suit-\nable for space applications, which are summarized below:\nMinimum mass and power consumption. Small mass\nresults in a total spacecraft mass reduction, lowering the\noverall cost of the mission. The power consumption\nneeds to be kept to a minimum to minimize additional\nneeds for batteries, solar cells, battery-charge regula-\ntors, and other power subsystems.\n* Minimum complexity. During spacecraft assembly,\nextended tests need to be carried out to confirm correct\noperation and connectivity of the different subsystems,\nresulting in increased cost and assembly time for the\nspacecraft. By minimizing complexity, the overall cost\nof the mission can be substantially decreased.\n*Minimum cost. By using mass-produced miniature com-\nmercial off-the-shelf motes, and thus replacing expen-\nsive custom space hardware, cost can be minimized.\n* Maximum reliability and lifetime. Using a larger num-\nber of micro-sensors to form a self-healing robust net-\nwork, instead of increasing the networks' reliability\nitself, increases reliability, redundancy, and lifetime.\n* Maximum performance. Miniature commercial off-the-\nshelf motes are being developed with more-capable data\nrates than the current CAN networks (32 kbps).\n* Radiation tolerance. Especially for long-distance deep-\nspace missions, radiation hardening of the electronic\ncomponents needs to be tested.\nAdditional features of the wireless network include embedded data\nsecurity, built-in routing\/networking, and long lifetime of opera-\ntion.\nThe intra-spacecraft network requirements are influenced by\nthe distribution of the motes inside the spacecraft. For a small\nspacecraft (Palmsat or a nanosatellite), due to its small size the\ndistance between each individual mote is small, resulting in mini-\nmum loss of signal strength (Figure 2a). For larger spacecraft, it is\nlikely that additional power will be required from the motes in\norder to transmit at higher power, as the motes will be positioned\nfurther apart, in different, separated compartments (Figure 2b). The\ncase for intra-spacecraft communication networks is similar.\nFor inter-spacecraft networks, network requirements are\ninfluenced by the distribution of the spacecraft within the swarm.\nThe distance between the spacecraft is the main network-design\nfactor. The range between the motes is influenced by the power\navailable for transmission, the technology used, and the antenna.\nHigher power can result in longer range, but from a spacecraft per-\nspective, it is required that the network be as power efficient as\npossible. Mesh networking as offered by ZigBee provides a solu-\ntion, by routing data from satellite to satellite with several data\nhops, decreasing the required range of transmission between satel-\nlites, as depicted in Figure 2 [1].\nFigure 3 shows an example with six satellites flying in forma-\ntion. The distance between satellites 1 and 3 is dl, which is consid-\nerably larger than d2 (the distance between satellites 1 and 2).\nUsing mesh networking, satellite 1 can transmit to satellite 3\nthrough satellite 2, decreasing the required range from d, (large) to\nd2 (small).\n3. Wireless Motes for Small Satellites\nThe wireless sensor nodes have specific requirements, which\nare limited by the wireless technology used and available power.\nWireless nodes are likely to be powered either from battery cells or\nfrom the spacecraft itself. Several wireless standards exist, each\none for a certain application field. For example, Wi-Fi, based on\nthe IEEE 802.1 in standard, is mainly for laptop and desktop com-\nputer networking, while Bluetooth, based on IEEE 802.15.1, is\nIEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, Vol. 48, No. 5, October 2006176\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The multi-data-hop mesh routing for a spacecraft\nformation.\nused for low-speed, short-range communications, e.g., between\nmobile phones and hands-free headsets. WiMAX, based on IEEE\n802.16, is field tested to provide the last mile for broadband con-\nnectivity where cable and DSL are too expensive to be installed.\nWiMedia, based on IEEE 802.15.3, uses Ultra-wideband (UWB),\naiming to replace cables between set-top boxes and display moni-\ntors. Although covering most of today's market needs, all of these\ntechnologies require a lot of power, making them unfavorable for\nspace applications, were power consumption is important.\nConsidering the spacecraft requirements for intra-spacecraft\nand inter-spacecraft networking, a low-power, low-cost solution\nwas proposed. ZigBee, based on the newly developed IEEE\n802.15.4 standard, offers a simple networking solution. Nodes\noperating under ZigBee will self-organize to form a communica-\ntion network inside and outside of the satellite. Each individual\nnode will communicate with its neighboring nodes, forming a\nmesh network topology capable of accommodating up to 65,000\nnodes on the same network [5]. Creating this mesh network, nodes\nwhich are not in range can communicate with each other by\nallowing packets to multi-hop to their final destination through\ninternediate nodes. This can theoretically extend the range of Zig-\nBee networks to infinity, provided that nodes exist in between, not\nmore than 100 m from each other. The packets will then hop from\nnode to node until they reach their final destination. ZigBee does\nnot require more processing power than an eight-bit microcontrol-\nler with onboard flash. ZigBee requires a low-duty cycle, and\noffers the ability to put 802.15.4 radios to sleep, which is the key to\nsmall power consumption. For example, consider the MICA2DOT\n(MPR5 1OCA) [3] mote, which requires 24 mW active power and\n3 gW standby power, with a duty cycle of 0.10%, supplied by a 3 V\n750 mAh battery cell. This will have a lifecycle of 27,780 hours,\nwhich is equivalent to three years and two months. Comparing this\nto the power requirements of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, which can\noperate from a few hours up to a few days at the maximum, ZigBee\nhas a clear advantage over these technologies.\nZigBee has a low data rate compared to other technologies,\nwith maximum rate of 250 kbps when operating at 2.4 GHz with\nthe use of directional antennas, making ZigBee suitable for intra-\nspacecraft communications. The MICA2DOT (MPR51OCA) [3]\nmote has four channels and operates at 433 MHz with a maximum\nbaud rate of 38.4 Kbaud, but it is expected that for a mesh network,\nthe rate can be decreased by a factor of 10. Comparing with the\nexisting CAN hardware, which offers a maximum rate of 32 kbps,\nthe performance of ZigBee for intra-spacecraft communications is\nacceptable. ZigBee is a low-cost and long-lifetime standard for\nwireless communication, fully complying with the requirements of\na low-cost low-mass solution. Table 1 shows different wireless\ntechnologies under consideration for space-mission applications.\n4. Formation Flying Application\nFormation-flying (FF) technology enables many small, inex-\npensive spacecraft to fly in formation and gather scientific data by\noperating as a \"virtual satellite.\" This \"virtual satellite\" concept\nlowers total mission risk, increases science data collection, and\nadds considerable flexibility to the missions. Satellites flying in\nformation will autonomously react to each other's attitude changes,\nrequiring minimum intervention from the ground. Formation-flying\nsatellites have the ability to collect data that was not feasible to\ncollect from a single satellite, such as stereo images, or data from\nthe same location from different angles.\nSpacecraft payloads often have competing and conflicting\nrequirements on a satellite's design. To achieve the highest rate of\nsuccess, several additional redundant systems are included onboard\nthe satellite, which impose additional overhead on the design and\nmanufacturing processes. By separating the scientific instruments\namong the satellites of the formation, we can minimize the risk of\nthe mission from total mission failure to instrument failure. Further\nto a mission failure, there is the potential for replacing the failed\nsatellite with a new one.\nEach satellite of the formation will be considerably smaller,\nlighter, simpler, simpler to manufacture, and mass produced to\ndecrease the mission cost to a minimum. Formation-flying algo-\nrithms are primarily concemed with the maintenance of the relative\nlocation of the satellites in the formation. Each satellite will have\nits own attitude-determination and control system (ADCS), and all\nthe usual subsystems, such as power and onboard computer (OBC),\nbut the scientific payloads required for the mission will be distrib-\nuted among the satellites. Each satellite needs to communicate with\nevery other satellite to combine data readings from the instruments\nand the sensors, and to transmit that data to the Earth ground sta-\ntion.\nA satellite cluster operating as a \"virtual satellite\" is a group\nof satellites within very close range of each other (100 m). Using\ndistributed architectures for the different payloads among the sat-\nellites of the formation, and by using one satellite as the executive\ncontroller for transmitting data to the ground, we require a wireless\nbus among the satellites for data transmission, with higher data\nrates compared with CAN (Control Area Network). The required\ndata rate of a nanosatellite like SNAP-1 [4] for a bi-directional\nCAN bus is 32 kbps, while the motes based on IEEE 802.15.4 used\nfor testing offer a rate of 38.4 Kbaud at 433 MHz, with the capa-\nbility to increase this rate to 250 Kbps with directional antennas at\nhigher operating frequencies. The satellite having the executive\ncontroller on board will be responsible for transmitting the data\ncaptured from the formation to the ground station with an S-band\nRF downlink. Assuming a formation of several SNAP-1 satellites,\nthe downlink data rate would be 38.4 kbps, or 76.8 kbps maxi-\nmum.\nApart from ZigBee, WiMAX was examined for inter-satellite\ncommunication. WiMAX offers a much larger range, and its\nbandwidth requires excessive amounts of power, compared with\nZigBee. For satellite-cluster missions, where distances between\nsatellites are small and data-rate requirements do not exceed the\nrequirements of a CAN bus, ZigBee was preferred for simplicity\nIEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine, Vol. 48, No. 5, October 2006178\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Conclusion\nWireless motes are currently being used for many intelligent,\nlow-power applications in many areas of the electronics industry,\nsuch as the automotive industry. Wireless links can prove to be\nuseful for spacecraft applications, particularity for small satellites.\nSavings in hamess mass and the capability of employing motes for\nboth intra- and inter-spacecraft applications makes the use of this\ntechnology very attractive. The advantages and challenges of using\nwireless motes for small satellites have been examined. Practical\nwork currently in progress indicates the promise of near-term\nimplementation of wireless motes on small satellite missions.\n2. V. Gupta, M. Wurm, M. Zhu, M. Millard, S. Fung, N.
