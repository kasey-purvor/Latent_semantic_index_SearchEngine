Introduction\nCarbon nanotubes (CNT) have been the focus of extensive research efforts in the\ncontext of multifunctional composite materials [1, 2]. The discovery of electrically\nconductive behaviour dominated by percolation at low filler loadings [3] has led to\nwide interest in the interplay between the processing and the electrical response of\ncarbon nanotube based nanocomposites. Thermosetting epoxies have been consid-\nered as the most promising candidate matrix polymers, as early results reported\nconductive behaviour by the addition of less than 0.1 wt. % of multi-walled nan-\notubes (MWNT) [4]. Few works have investigated the addition of carbon nanotubes\nin unsaturated polyester resin systems [5, 6, 7, 8]; the observed percolation thresholds\nare about 1 wt. % for entangled CNT and about 0.1 wt. % for non-entangled CNT.\nVinyl ester based nanocomposites, similarly to epoxy, follow conductive behaviour\nat concentrations of nanofiller below 0.1 wt. % [9]. The electrical percolation and\nconductivity of CNT nanocomposites is the topic of a large number of publications,\nwhich have been recently reviewed in [10]. As the authors point out, nanocomposites\nbased on non-entangled MWNT are about 50 times more conductive than industrial\nMWNT.\nThe electrical properties of heterogeneous systems of conductive fillers in insu-\nlating matrices above the percolation threshold can be described by the statistical\npercolation model as follows [11]:\n\u03c3 = \u03c3\u00af0(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8c)\nt\u00af , \u03c8 > \u03c8c (1)\nwhere \u03c3 is the conductivity of the nanocomposite , \u03c8 denotes the volume fraction of\nthe filler, t\u00af is a critical exponent that depends on the geometry of the network, \u03c3\u00af0\nis the proportionality coefficient and \u03c8c is the percolation threshold, i.e. the volume\n2\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nfraction of filler necessary to form a network of contacting particles, at which the\nsystem behaviour changes from electrically insulating to conductive. The percolation\nthreshold can be calculated analytically using the excluded volume theory [12, 13],\nwhich for a filler of cylindrical shape and high aspect ratio yields:\n\u03c8c = 1\u2212 e\n(\n\u2212\n1.4[(pi\/4)W2L+(pi\/6)W3]\n[(4pi\/3)W3+2piW2L+(pi\/2)WL2]\n)\n(2)\nwhere W is the diameter and L is the length of the nanotubes. This result assumes\nstraight and randomly oriented filler rods. It is expected that waviness alone, assum-\ning ideal dispersion, leads to an increase of percolation threshold of up to a factor of\ntwo [14]. The concentrations used for the percolation model described by Eq. 1 are\nexpressed in terms of volume fractions. Since the density of nanotubes is not known\nwith high accuracy it is more convenient to use an expression that involves weight\nfractions when referring to CNT based nanocomposites. The low loading fractions\nallow Eq. 1 to be modified as follows:\n\u03c3 = \u03c30(\u03c6\u2212 \u03c6c)\nt , \u03c6 > \u03c6c (3)\nHere \u03c6 is the weight fraction, \u03c6c is the weight fraction percolation threshold and \u03c30\nand t denote the proportionality coefficient and the exponent of the weight fractions\npercolation model respectively.\nThe quality of filler dispersion is a critical factor in the preparation of nanocom-\nposites based on nanotubes, governing the effectiveness of electrical conductivity en-\nhancement [15]. Materials characterised by non-homogeneous dispersion of nanofiller\nhave improved electrical properties compared to the neat resin; however the loading\nrequired to form a percolating network is significantly higher than that predicted by\nEq. 2 [10]. Commercial multi-walled nanotubes are typically wavy and mechani-\n3\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \ncally entangled in microscopic clusters, which must be dispersed in the resin matrix\nwithout excessively damaging their structure and without decreasing their length.\nAligned multi-walled and single-walled nanotubes are easier to disperse due to the\npartial elimination of both waviness and entanglement. Several techniques have been\nused successfully to disperse nanotubes in thermosetting resins including high shear\nmixing, triple-roll milling and ultrasonication [16], with the route used usually being\nspecific to the type of the matrix.\nWhen homogeneous dispersions of filler particles are allowed to partially reag-\ngregate during cure, the resulting electrical conductivity can be higher than that of\nthe non reaggregated material [17]. The fractal structure of the filler network results\nin more contacts between nanotubes than that predicted by statistical percolation\ntheory, leading to increased conductivity. This phenomenon has been observed ini-\ntially in the preparation of carbon black reinforced epoxy composites [18] and has\nbeen confirmed in carbon nanotube reinforced epoxy nanocomposites [19, 17, 20].\nDuring the process of dispersion the filler particles become electrostatically charged,\nstabilising the suspension and preventing spontaneous agglomeration. The forma-\ntion and the morphology of the structure of aggregates can be influenced by the\napplication of electric field [21] and shear [22]. However, well-dispersed suspensions\nof nanotubes in epoxy have been reported to reaggregate spontaneously as a con-\nsequence of hardener addition [17]. The lowest percolation thresholds reported in\nthe literature are 0.0021 wt. % for composites based on non-entangled multi-walled\nnanotubes [21, 22, 19], 0.005 wt. % for single-walled nanotubes [17] and 0.011 wt. %\nfor entangled multi-walled nanotubes [4, 20], all of which have been obtained using\nepoxy matrices. As Bauhofer and Kovacs point out in their review [10], with opti-\nmised dispersion a percolation threshold in the range of 0.1 wt. % might be possible\nfor nearly any CNT\/polymer system.\n4\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nThis work reports on the development of an unsaturated polyester\/nanotube\nnanocomposite with low percolation threshold. The process of dispersion based on\nhigh shear mixing is monitored on-line by measuring the electrical resistivity of the\nliquid suspension. Microscopy is utilised to study the spatial structure of the nan-\notubes network formed by reaggregation during the cure of the matrix. The electrical\nbehaviour of the cured material is investigated and its dependence on the content\nof nanotubes is used to evaluate the percolation threshold of the nanocomposite.\nThis paper demonstrates that well dispersed suspensions of entangled MWNTs in\nunsaturated polyesters produce nanocomposites with the same levels of conductivity\nas these observed in epoxy\/entangled-MWNTs systems.\n2. Experimental\nThe carbon nanotubes used in this work are a commercial grade of entangled\nmultiwalled nanotubes, prepared by carbon vapour deposition, with a carbon pu-\nrity of 90%, nominal diameter and length of 9.5 nm and 1.5 \u00b5m respectively. The\npercolation threshold, calculated by equation 2 without accounting for waviness, is\n0.43 vol%, which can be related to a value of gravimetric percolation threshold of\napproximately 0.96 wt. % [10, 23].\nThe matrix used for the preparation of nanocomposites is an unsaturated polyester\nresin (UPE, from Scott Bader), with styrene content of 30 wt. %. Neat resin and\nnanocomposites were cured following a standard industrial procedure, by the addi-\ntion of 0.02 wt. % of cobalt octanoate and 0.3 wt. % of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide.\nAfter the addition of cobalt and peroxide the samples were placed in an oven at 40\u00b0C\nfor 6 hours, followed by 3 hours at 120\u00b0C to obtain full cure.\n5\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n2.1. Sample Preparation\nA masterbatch of pre-dispersed carbon nanotubes has been prepared using the\nprocedure described by other authors [9, 24]. Appropriate amounts of unsaturated\npolyester resin and masterbatch were compounded to obtain mixtures with CNT\nloading ranging from 0.05 to 0.3 wt. %. The dispersion in the UPE resin was\ncarried out by high shear mixing using a lab-scale setup described in [25]. The\napparatus comprises an overhang stirrer, a flow-through cell and a condenser to limit\nstyrene evaporation. Each sample was mixed for 420 minutes at 1000 rpm, whilst\nthe temperature was kept between 30 and 35\u00b0C. The extent of styrene evaporation\nhas been investigated measuring the matrix-dominated high-shear viscosity of the\nsuspensions prepared [26]. At all the filler loadings the analysis showed no measurable\neffect of styrene evaporation during processing.\nDuring processing a peristaltic pump fed the material to a coaxial flow-through\ncell designed to measure the resistivity of the liquid [25]. The deviations of resistance\ndue to temperature variations were corrected by assuming an Arrhenius dependence\nof conductivity on temperature and calculating the values of resistivity at a reference\ntemperature of 34\u00b0C, following the procedure described in [25]. The procedure for\non-line measurement of suspension conductivity is reported in [27].\n2.2. Microscopic analysis\nThe quality of dispersion after mixing was assessed by transmission optical mi-\ncroscopy of the liquid suspension [28]. A sample of 20\u00b11 mg of mixed material\nwas placed onto a microscope slide and a 16 mm cover slip was positioned on top.\nThe liquid was uniformly spread over the whole area under the slip. The resulting\nthickness of liquid nanocomposite is 90\u00b110 \u00b5m. All the samples were analysed with\nidentical sub-stage illumination.\n6\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nTransmission optical microscopy and SEM charge contrast imaging were used to\ninvestigate the morphology of the nanotubes in the cured composites. The samples\nfor optical microscopy were 100\u00b120 \u00b5m thick slices of cured material, cut from the\nsurface of the sample. The slices were cut using a Buehler Isomet precision sectioning\nsaw with a diamond wafering blade. The samples for charge contrast imaging were\nprepared by painting a thin layer of the suspension, after the addition of cobalt and\nperoxide, onto an aluminium stub and oven-curing as described before. Micrographs\nof the surface of the samples were taken using a FEI SFEG-SEM at acceleration\nvoltage 15 kV, working distance 5 mm and TLD detector.\n2.3. Electrical measurements\nAC impedance spectroscopy was carried out after cure using a Solartron SI 1260\nfrequency response analyser. An interdigitated copper sensor (GIA sensors, Pear-\nson Panke) was embedded in the material by immersion in a glass tube containing\nthe liquid resin, previously mixed with cobalt and peroxide. The glass tube was\nplaced in a heated cell and cured using the thermal profile described previously. The\nmeasurements were performed after cure completion, at temperature of 40\u00b0C, in the\nfrequency range between 1 Hz and 1 MHz measuring five frequencies per decade on\na logarithmic scale. The AC conductivity \u03c3 of the sample was calculated from the\nreal and imaginary parts of complex impedance (Z\u22c6) as follows:\n\u03c3(\u03c9) =\nl\n|Z\u22c6(\u03c9)|\n(4)\nwhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency and l = 3.93 m\u22121 is the geometric constant of the\nsensor [29].\nThe DC electrical conductivity of the cured materials was determined by a two-\npoint measurement. The two parallel faces of a cylinder of cured material (diameter\n8 mm, height 4 mm) were painted with a suspension of silver in methyl isobutyl\n7\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nketone (Acheson Electrodag 1415M). After complete evaporation of the solvent, the\nvalue of resistance was measured at 20\u00b0C. High resistance samples, i.e. the neat resin,\nwere characterised with a Keithley 6517A electrometer. Low resistance samples, i.e.\nnanocomposites, were characterised with a DC precision current source (Keithley\n6220) and a nanovoltmeter (Keithley 2182A) using the three-point delta current\nreversal technique [30]. The DC conductivity of each sample has been measured four\ntimes on four different cylinders at each level of loading, calculating the corresponding\nstandard deviations. The process of dispersion and cure has been replicated for\ntwo levels of loading, randomly chosen, namely 0.25 wt. % and 0.3 wt. %. The\nreplicability of the process of preparation of the nanocomposite has been confirmed by\nthe absence of statistically significant difference betweeen the mean DC conductivity\nof replications.\n3.

The evolution of resistivity for the 0.05 wt. % suspension is similar to\nthe 0.1 wt. % loading, but the inclusion of air bubbles during mixing caused a high\nnoise-to-signal ratio. The mixing at 0.05 wt. % has been excluded from the graph\nfor better clarity.\nAt the beginning of the process the resistivity is in the order of several M\u2126m,\nand decreases slowly with mixing. After an incubation period, whose duration varies\nwith the filler content (e.g. about 50 minutes in the sample containing 0.2 wt. %\nCNT), the resistivity falls. The magnitude of the decrease is correlated with the filler\nloading of each mixture. This is followed by a steady decrease until the end of the\nprocess. The value of liquid resistivity at the end of processing varies between 4.2\nM\u2126 and 24.7 k\u2126 at 0.1 and 0.3 wt. %, respectively.\nThe incubation period corresponds to the time necessary for individually dis-\npersed CNTs to reach the onset of percolation. The amount of individually dispersed\nnanotubes at a certain time of processing is higher for suspensions with higher filler\nloading. The interpretation of the liquid suspensions in terms of percolation explains\nthe sharp fall of resistivity observed for loadings 0.2 wt. % and above, which is typical\nof such systems at percolation. The downward trend in the final part of processing\nsuggests that dispersion is not complete after 420 minutes of mixing.\nFigure 2 illustrates the filler dispersion during the mixing of the 0.15 wt. %\nsuspension. Clusters of undispersed nanotubes appear as isolated dark particles.\nThe dimension of these particles decreases with mixing. Dark areas with size of\nseveral tens of micrometres are observed after 160 minutes. At the end of processing\nthe suspension appears homogeneous and optically dispersed [28], with dimension\nof residual clusters of undispersed nanotubes below 5 micrometres. The total area\ncovered by the residual clusters appears small compared to the samples before shear\n9\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nFigure 2: Optical micrographs of 0.15 wt. % suspension before, during and after\nmixing.\nmixing (not shown here) and the residual area is similar between all loadings. The\nexistence of undispersed nanotube clusters corroborates the suggestion of incomplete\ndispersion based on the continuous drop of liquid resistivity.\n3.2. Morphology of CNT in cured nanocomposites\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3: Nanocomposite containing 0.15 wt. % of carbon nanotubes: (a) transmis-\nsion light micrograph (b) charge contrast imaging.\nFigure 3a shows the microstructure of the cured nanocomposite containing 0.15\nwt. % . This loading has been selected to show and to compare reaggregation at mi-\ncroscale and nanoscale, as the best compromise between high conductivity required\n10\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nfor contrast charge imaging and optical transmission required for optical microscopy.\nThe existence of an heterogeneous structure comprising areas of high and low nan-\notube content is observed with optical microscopy. The low brightness regions, cor-\nresponding to relatively higher nanotube content, cover a significant percentage of\nthe sample area indicating the existence of aggregates of a different nature to those\noriginally mixed with the resin. These aggregates, which are formed during the cure\nof the material, are not as tightly packed as the original clusters. Charge contrast\nimaging can be used to visualise the morphology of the reaggregated nanotubes em-\nbedded in the resin in the proximity of the sample surface [31, 32]. Figure 3b is\na representative example of the structure of such secondary agglomerate. Its size\nis about 10 \u00b5m and it comprises an assembly of loosely packed nanotubes. Since\nthe tubes are wavy and entangled, a precise evaluation of their length is not possi-\nble. However, most of the visible nanotubes appear to be longer than the nominal\nlength of 1.5 \u00b5m, suggesting that carbon nanotubes have not been damaged during\nprocessing.\n3.3. Electrical behaviour\nImpedance spectroscopy has been used to evaluate the AC conductivity of com-\nposites at the end of cure, as shown in figure 4. The neat cured resin follows a purely\ncapacitive behaviour at all frequencies. The nanocomposite with loading of 0.05 wt.\n% exhibits a frequency independent conductivity up to 104 Hz, which changes to a\ncapacitive response at high frequencies. The nanocomposites with nanotubes load-\ning greater than 0.1 wt. % show a predominantly resistive electrical behaviour, with\nconstant conductivity over the whole range of frequencies investigated.\nThe effect of filler loading on the DC conductivity of the solid composites is\nshown in figure 5a. The neat resin is an insulating material, with an electrical\n11\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n10-9\n10-8\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n100 101 102 103 104 105 106\n\u03c3\n \n[S\n\/m\n]\nFrequency [Hz]\n0.30 wt%\n0.25 wt%\n0.20 wt%\n0.15 wt%\n0.10 wt%\n0.05 wt%\nneat resin\nFigure 4: AC conductivity at the end of curing as a function of frequency for different\nfiller loadings.\nconductivity in the order of 10\u221212 S\/m. Addition of 0.05 wt. % of filler increases the\nelectrical conductivity by eight orders of magnitude, to the value of 2.7 \u00b7 10\u22124 S\/m.\nConductivity increases further with higher loading, up to 1.3\u00b710\u22121 S\/m at the highest\nloading tested. The values of DC conductivity are in agreement with the values of\nAC conductivity measured by impedance spectroscopy. The conductivity of the\nliquid suspensions at the end of processing is compared with the conductivity of the\nnanocomposite in figure 5a. The values in the two cases differ by a factor of about 104.\nIt is interesting to note that the two trends imply a positive correlation between liquid\nand solid conductivity. This specific subject has not been developed within this study\nand will be the subject of further investigation . However, the experimental data\nsuggest that the electric behaviour of liquid suspensions and solid nanocomposites\nare controlled by percolation in similar manners. Liquid conductivity measurements\nduring processing might potentially be exploited to predict the final conductivity of\n12\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \n10-12\n10-10\n10-8\n10-6\n10-4\n10-2\n100\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35\nCo\nnd\nuc\ntiv\nity\n [S\n\/m\n]\nCNT loading [wt%]\nNeat Resin\nSolid\nLiquid\n(a)\n10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n10-4 10-3 10-2\n\u03c3\n \n[S\n\/m\n] \n\u03a6-\u03a6c\n\u03c30 = 4.6\u22c510\n5\n S\/m\n\u03a6c = 0.026 wt%\nt    = 2.55\nR2 = 0.990\n(b)\nFigure 5: (a) DC conductivity as a function of filler loading.

The solid nanocomposites show the characteristics\nof a percolating system. Conductivity at various loading has been fitted to the model\nof statistical percolation described by equation 3, resulting in a percolation threshold\nof 0.026 wt. % and a critical exponent of 2.55. The value of percolation threshold\nis significantly lower that the value predicted by statistical percolation theory (0.96\nwt. %). This suggest that the electrical properties of the CNT-unsaturated polyester\ncomposite are enhanced by the spontaneous reaggregation of filler particles during\ncure, as previously reported for CNT\/epoxy systems.\nThe electrical properties of the material described in this study have been com-\npared with the data published in literature. The percolation threshold observed\ncompares well with the best results obtained with entangled MWNT in different\npolymers, i.e. epoxy, polyurethane and vinyl esters [9, 10]. The value is forty\ntimes lower than the 1 wt. % previously observed for entangled MWNT\/unsaturated\n13\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \npolyester systems and four times lower than the 0.1 wt. % observed for non-entangled\nMWNT\/unsaturated polyester systems [8]. Given the simple preparation process,\nthe low cost of the resin and the electrical conductivity achieved, CNT\/unsaturated\npolyester nanocomposites hold potential for the production of electrically conductive\ncomposites.\n4. Conclusion\nThe preparation of microscopically uniform unsaturated polyester nanocompos-\nites based on industrial grade multi-walled nanotubes has been carried out success-\nfully using a combination of triple roll milling and shear mixing. The resistivity\nof the liquid composite has been measured to monitor the evolution of dispersion\nduring processing. The on-line data showed that, after an incubation period that\nis correlated to the filler loading, the resistivity of the suspension decreases steadily\nuntil the end of the process. The magnitude of the drop is also positively correlated\nto the filler loading. This is followed by a gradual decrease which is attributed to the\nexistence of residual undispersed clusters of nanotubes. The value of conductivity of\nthe liquid suspension at the end of mixing is directly correlated to the filler loading\nand the final value of conductivity of the nanocomposites.\nThe final level of dispersion achieved was adequate to create a conductive network\nwhilst preserving the high aspect ratio of filler particles. Well dispersed suspensions\nof nanotubes in unsaturated polyester form a spatial structure of agglomerates during\ncure which results in a percolation threshold of 0.026 wt. %. The cured nanocom-\nposite has maximum conductivity of 0.13 S\/m for 0.3 wt. % CNT loading.\n14\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nAcknowledgements\nFinancial support from EPSRC (EP\/E001874 and EP\/C509730), donation of\nmaterials and financial support from Scott Bader Ltd are gratefully acknowledged.\nReferences\n[1] M.
