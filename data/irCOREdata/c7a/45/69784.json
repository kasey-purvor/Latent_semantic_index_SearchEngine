It underpins understanding of geochemistry and of the uptake of nutrients and toxicants by\nbiota. Great strides have been made in the last two decades in appreciating trace metal complexation,\nparticularly through the application of the techniques of anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) [1] and\ncompetitive ligand exchange, including cathodic stripping voltammetry [2,3]. Yet, as understanding has\nadvanced and the true complexity of the distribution of ligand binding strengths has been recognized,\nour ability to quantify fully the chemistry of natural waters has apparently receded [4].\nAnother feature of the chemistry of natural waters that is increasingly being recognized is the\ndynamics of the interactions [5]. Changes in chemical forms occur both continuously and episodically\nthrough many processes, including colloidal pumping [6], release from or uptake by biota [7], and\ngaseous exchange [8]. Collecting and storing samples may disrupt these processes and can introduce\nother perturbations, such as pH changes, that can alter the chemistry of the sample from its natural state.\nBuffle et al. [9] have argued strongly that, ultimately, fully reliable information on the distribution of\nchemical species in a natural water can only be achieved if measurements are made in situ so that the\n*Lecture presented at the 11th European Conference on Analytical Chemistry (EUROANALYSIS XI), Lisbon, Portugal, 3\u20139\nSeptember 2000. Other presentations are published in this issue, pp. 1\u201354.\n\u2020Corresponding author\nproblems of sampling are bypassed. Competitive ligand exchange techniques cannot be used without\nperturbing the sample because the measurement involves adding a ligand (and often a buffering reagent)\nand reestablishing a new equilibrium situation. Colombo et al. [10] have accomplished this procedure\non-line in pumped water samples on board ship to provide virtually continuous measurements.\nHowever, as reagents are still added and the samples degassed, composition is inevitably changed from\nthe in situ condition in the 2\u20133 min that elapses from sample removal to measurement. While ion-selec-\ntive electrodes are in principle an ideal tool for in situ measurement and have been used in certain spe-\ncial conditions as microelectrodes [11], they generally lack the required sensitivity for trace metals.\nVoltammetry, however, has the correct attributes for in situ measurement of metals, as it minimally per-\nturbs the sample and in stripping mode is extremely sensitive. ASV has been used in situ to measure\ntrace metals directly in water columns [12] and direct voltammetry to measure iron and manganese in\nthe pore waters of sediments [13].\nOne of the difficulties encountered in using voltammetry directly is defining exactly what it meas-\nures. Generally, free metal ions are regarded as electroactive. However, all those chemical species that\ncan dissociate rapidly, to yield the free metal ion as it is removed at the electrode, will also be meas-\nured [14]. This usually embraces all inorganic species and many organic complexes, including most\nmetal complexes with humic and fulvic substances. Very strong complexes are not measured, as their\nkinetics of dissociation are too slow. This mixture of complexes that contribute to the signal leads to\ninterpretation difficulties, as complexes of different sizes have different sensitivities and calibration\ncurves due to their different diffusion coefficients. In their titrations of natural waters with metal ions\nwhile measuring the ASV response, Donat et al. [2] have elegantly solved this problem by carefully\nselecting the conditions to ensure that only labile inorganic species are measured. Complexed metals\ngenerally require more negative deposition potentials than simple metal ions. By choosing an optimum\npotential, metal can be accumulated from simple labile complexes while effectively excluding labile,\norganically complexed metal. The distinction is further enhanced by using a thin-film rotating disc elec-\ntrode to ensure a very thin diffusion layer, which allows less time for metal-organic complexes to dis-\nsociate as they are transported to the electrode. This commendable procedure would be difficult to use\nin situ, however. Pei et al. [15] have chosen instead to use mercury-coated microelectrodes which have\na thin spherical diffusion layer that is not influenced by solution flow. They have demonstrated that nat-\nural surfactants can bias in situ measurements and have overcome the problem by encasing the elec-\ntrode in a layer of gel. Use of a gel has potential for further discriminating the measured species on the\nbasis of size as well as lability.\nAn analogous technique for measuring labile metals has been created by backing a well-defined\nlayer of gel with a binding agent, such as Chelex [16]. The technique is known as diffusive gradients in\nthin films (DGT), as it relies on establishing a linear diffusion gradient through the gel while it is\ndeployed. The accumulated mass of metal, M, is measured after deployment by eluting the metal with\nacid, and eq. 1 used to calculate the concentration, C, in the deployed solution. \nC = M\u2206g\/(DtA) (1)\nDg is the thickness of the diffusion layer, D is the diffusion coefficient, t is the deployment time and A\nis the area of the exposed gel. As the device can be configured as a simple disc in a plastic holder, it is\nreadily deployed in situ [17]. Like ASV, DGT measures both labile inorganic and organic species [18].\nQuantitative determination of these two groups of species has been achieved for Cu by making parallel\nmeasurements using devices equipped with gels of different pore sizes [19]. The method relies on most\nlabile metal-organic complexes being fairly large molecules, and small, labile metal-organic complex-\nes being negligible compared to the total inorganic metal species. Here we report the measurement by\nDGT of both labile inorganic and labile organic Cu species in solutions containing humic substances\nextracted from peat.\nH. ZHANG AND W. DAVISON\n\u00a9 2001 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 73, 9\u201315\n10\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nDGT preparation and procedures\nProcedures for gel preparation have been given in detail previously [20]. The diffusional properties,\nwith respect to simple metal ions, fulvic substances, and humic substances extracted from both water\nand peat, of the three gels used in this work have been reported previously [19,20]. The three gels are\nmade of the following: (a) 1.5% pure agarose (AGE), (b) an acrylamide monomer cross-linked with a\npatented agarose derivative (DGT Research) (APA), and (c) an acrylamide monomer cross-linked with\nbis-acrylamide (RG). Both the AGE and APA gels have open structures that allow free diffusion of sim-\nple metal ions, with diffusion coefficients equivalent to those in water. They retard the diffusion of\nhumic substances slightly, with the effect being more pronounced for the APA gel. Restricted gel (RG)\nhas a much smaller pore size. It retards the diffusion of humic substances much more markedly and\nslightly retards the diffusion of simple metal ions.\nThe Chelex resin was cast into a separate layer of the APA gel, known as the resin-gel. It com-\nprised 2g of Chelex 100 (Na form, 200\u2013400 mesh) set in 10 ml of gel solution. All gels were hydrated\nin ultra-pure water, MilliQ (MQ), for at least 24 h before use, to allow them to establish a new stable\ndimension. Diffusive gels were soaked for a further 24 h in 0.1 M NaNO3 solution to eliminate diffu-\nsional artefacts present at low ionic strengths [20].\nGel holders based on a simple, tight-fitting, piston design with a 2-cm diameter window were\nused for all measurements [21]. They were assembled with wet components to prevent entrapping air\nbubbles. A 0.8-mm-thick diffusive gel was placed on top of a 0.4-mm-thick resin gel, resting on the pis-\nton surface with the side packed with resin beads facing upwards. After adding a 135-\u00b5m-thick, \n0.45-\u00b5m pore size, cellulose nitrate membrane on top of the diffusive gel, the front cap was pressed\ndown lightly to form a good seal. The membrane behaves as an extension of the diffusion layer [20].\nAnalysis\nAfter deployment, the resin gel layers were carefully removed from the DGT assemblies and placed in\n1.5-mL vials. One milliliter of 1 M HNO3 was added and left for a day. Electrothermal atomic absorp-\ntion spectroscopy (ETAAS) was used to measure the concentration of Cu in the eluent, from which the\naccumulated mass could be calculated [19]. Total concentrations of metals were measured by ETAAS\ndirectly. ASV used an Ecochimie Autolab PSTAT 10, DAC 124 coupled to a Metrohm VA electrode\nstand. Cu was deposited at a mercury drop electrode at \u20130.4V (Ag\/AgCl) for 60 s. After a 5-s rest peri-\nod, differential pulse scans were performed from \u20130.35 to 0 V.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nPrinciples of measurement\nThe theoretical background to the use of DGT with different gel compositions to measure inorganic and\norganic species separately has been elaborated [19]. For any DGT device, the mass of metal accumu-\nlated (MDGT) is the sum of the contributions from both labile inorganic (Minorg) and organic (Morg)\nspecies (eq. 2)\nMDGT = Minorg + Morg (2)\nAccording to DGT, theory based on Fick\u2019s laws of diffusion [18]\nMinorg = (Dinorg Cinorg At)\/\u2206g (3)\nMorg = (Dorg Corg At)\/\u2206g (4)\n\u00a9 2001 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 73, 9\u201315\nIn situ speciation measurements 11\nCinorg and Corg are the concentrations of labile inorganic species and labile organic species that can be\nmeasured by DGT. It is assumed that all simple inorganic species have the same effective diffusion coef-\nficient in the gel, Dinorg, and that all metal organic complexes can be represented by a mean diffusion\ncoefficient in the gel, Dorg. In fresh waters, humic substances dominate the organic ligands. Their dif-\nfusion coefficients have been shown to be similar irrespective of their original source [22]. Combining\neqs. 2, 3, and 4 results in eq. 5.\nMDGT = (Dinorg Cinorg + Dorg Corg) At\/\u2206g (5)\nIf several devices with different gel compositions, but with the same surface area and diffusion layer\nthickness, are deployed for the same time, the term At\/\u2206g is a constant, denoted by K. Equation 5 can\nthen be rearranged to eq. 6.\nMDGT\/KDinorg = Cinorg + (Dorg\/Dinorg) Corg (6)\nPlots of MDGT\/KDinorg versus Dorg\/Dinorg have been shown to be linear for Cu at various concentrations\nin solutions of both fulvic and humic acids extracted from natural waters [19].\nThree different types of DGT devices, with AGE, APA, and RG gels were deployed for from 2 to 8\nh, depending on the copper concentration, in solutions containing 0.1 M NaNO3, 2mM tris and humic\nacid extracted from peat. This extract, supplied by J. Lead, had been previously well characterized, and\nthe molecular weight of 16 500 determined by ultra centrifugation [23]. The 4 L of well-stirred solu-\ntion were maintained at a known temperature in the range 15\u201322 \u00b0C. The diffusion coefficient of the\nhumic substances at 20 \u00b0C in the AGE gel immersed in 0.1 M NaNO3 with tris buffer (pH 7.8) was \n7.4 10\u20137 cm2 s\u20131 and in the APA gel was 3.5 10\u20137 cm2 s\u20131. Values were not available for the restricted\ngel, as they were too low to measure in the timescale of the experiment. Copper was added to create\nthree solutions used in experiments A, B, and C, with total copper contents of 410, 1105, and 1910 nM.\nWith only two data points for the APA and AGE gels, eq. 6 can be rearranged to calculate Cinorg and\nCorg directly (eqs. 7 and 8) rather than plotting a line.\nCinorg = (AGEM\/AGEDorg \u2013 APAM\/APADorg) \/ [K(AGEDinorg\/AGEDorg \u2013 APADinorg\/APADorg)] (7)\nCorg = (AGEM\/AGEDinorg \u2013 APAM\/APADinorg) \/ [K(AGEDorg\/AGEDinorg \u2013 APADorg\/APADinorg)] (8)\nAGEM, AGEDinorg, and AGEDorg represent mass of metal accumulated on the DGT device with the AGE\ngel and the diffusion coefficients of the inorganic and organic species in this gel. The APA and RG\nsuperscripts indicate the equivalent terms for the other gels. From previous measurements [20] it is\nknown that AGEDinorg = 6.20 10\u20136, APADinorg = 6.28 10\u20136 and RGDinorg = 4.50 10\u20136 (all cm2 s\u20131).\nMeasurement of Cinorg and Corg\nThe measured values of Cinorg and Corg are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1, along with the total dissolved\nCu measured by ETAAS, the ASV measured Cu, Cinorg measured by a single restricted gel, Csinorg (see\nbelow), and the distribution of Cu species calculated using the speciation code WHAM [24) from the\ntotal concentrations of dissolved copper and humic substances. The sum of the inorganic and organic\nspecies measured by DGT agrees very well with the total concentration measured by AAS, confirming\nthe accuracy of the DGT measurement. The ASV result lies between the concentration of inorganic\nspecies and the total dissolved concentration. As ASV was calibrated by standard addition of Cu2+ to\nthe solution, the measurement effectively assumes that all species have this same high diffusion coeffi-\ncient. In fact, the metal complexes of these relatively large peat-derived humic substances can be\nexpected to have a diffusion coefficient in water approximately one fifth of that of the free metal ion\n[20]. The most conservative estimate is that they would diffuse more slowly than the free metal ion by\na factor of 3 [22]. Therefore, the ASV signal would be expected to be equivalent to the DGT measure-\nment of inorganic species plus 0.2\u20130.3 times the organic species measurement. For the two higher cop-\nH. ZHANG AND W. DAVISON\n\u00a9 2001 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 73, 9\u201315\n12\nper concentrations, the ASV signal is higher than this, as found previously [19]. There are several pos-\nsibilities for this discrepancy, including: (a) a problem with the ASV measurement or calibration, (b)\noverestimation of the inorganic species by DGT, and (c) there being a greater proportion of Cu-humic\ncomplexes with molecular weights and diffusion coefficients less than those assumed.\n\u00a9 2001 IUPAC, Pure and Applied Chemistry 73, 9\u201315\nIn situ speciation measurements 13\nTable 1 Results from experiments, A, B, and C, at three different total Cu\nconcentrations in solutions of 0.1 M NaNO3, 2 mM tris and 1 mg\/l humic\nacid. The measured masses, M, accumulated by DGT assemblies with RG,\nAPA, and AGE gels are shown. Concentrations of total Cu-inorganic species\nfor each solution are calculated from the two DGT-measured masses with\nAPA and AGE gels (Cinorg), from the DGT mass from the RG gel (Csinorg)\nand using the WHAM speciation code (Winorg). Concentrations of total \ncopper-organic complexes for each solution are calculated from the two APA\nand AGE gels (Corg) and from the WHAM speciation code (Worg).\nExperiment A B C\n[Cu]T 410 \u00b1 28 1105 \u00b1 64 1910 \u00b1 56\nMRG (nmoles) 483 1006 1476\nMAPA (nmoles) 1069 1600 2305\nMAGE (nmoles) 1598 1966 2659\nCinorg (nM) 31 228 618\nCsinorg (nM) 34 232 638\nWinorg (nM) 2.5 166 716\nCorg (nM) 372 817 1252\nWorg (nM) 408 939 1194\nFig. 1 Measurements, for each experiment A, B, and C, of total dissolved Cu (TD), labile Cu by ASV (ASV),\ninorganic and inorganic Cu by two DGT gels (2DGT), inorganic Cu by one restricted gel (RG), and the distribution\nof inorganic and organic Cu calculated using WHAM (WHAM).\nDGT can be used, like ASV, to calculate concentration from a single measurement assuming that\nonly the diffusion coefficient for the free metal ion applies. However, for the most restricted gel, RG,\nthe diffusion coefficient of peat humic substances is extremely low. Judging from the diffusion of aquat-\nic humic substances in different gels and the relationship of the known diffusion coefficients of peat and\naquatic humic substances, it is probably about 0.02 times the diffusion coefficient of inorganic copper\nspecies [20]. Therefore, this direct measurement by DGT would be expected to differ very little from\nthe measurement of inorganic species using two different gels. This is exactly what is found in practice,\nwith excellent agreement between Csinorg and Cinorg (Table 1, Fig. 1). Arguably, Csinorg measured with a\nsingle restricted gel is more accurate than Cinorg obtained using of two separate gels, as it is more direct\nand does not involve the subtraction of potentially quite similar terms (eq. 7), with consequent summa-\ntion of errors.\nFor the two higher concentrations of Cu, there was good agreement between the predicted distri-\nbution of species using the WHAM model and the measured values (Fig. 1). The effective binding con-\nstants used in the WHAM model were derived by fitting the model to numerous reported data sets from\nlaboratory experiments on the binding of metals to humic substances [24]. Therefore, assuming that the\nmechanistic base of the model adequately describes the effects of changes in solution composition, such\nas ionic strength and pH, the model effectively acts as a conduit for comparing the past data on copper-\nmetal binding with the results and conditions of this work. Clearly, agreement between DGT and other\nmeasurements is good. This is not the case, however, for the lower concentration of total copper where\nWHAM (and therefore previous data) would suggest more complexation of copper with organic matter\n(99.4%) than measured by DGT (92.3%). There is a possibility that the DGT procedure may overesti-\nmate inorganic copper species when they represent a small proportion of the total dissolved copper. For\nthe experiment with the AGE and APA gels, this could occur if a small fraction of the organic com-\nplexes has a sufficiently low molecular weight to diffuse appreciably more rapidly in the gels than\nexpected from the measured mean diffusion coefficient. However, the good agreement with the meas-\nurement using only the restricted gel argues against this idea. Humic substances diffuse much less freely\nin this more restricted gel, and, therefore, any tailing of the diffusion coefficient to higher values would\nhave affected the measurement with the RG gel much less than that with the AGE and APA gels. It may\nbe that previous measurements used to parametize WHAM did not cover these low concentrations of\nCu and humic substances or that those that did were inaccurate. Further detailed measurements, focus-\ning on higher ratios of humic substances to copper ions than those used in this work are clearly required\nto examine further the performance of DGT compared to other techniques.\nDGT should work particularly well as a speciation technique with peat-derived humic substances,\nas their relatively large molecular weight ensures a good distinction in diffusion coefficients from inor-\nganic species. Use of the restricted gel in a single measurement then works well to give an accurate dis-\ncrimination of inorganic and organic species. With lower-molecular-weight species, greater reliance has\nto be placed on parallel deployments with at least two gels. For the same concentration of Cu (e.g., 1.1\nmM), DGT has shown increasing complexation with higher-molecular-weight humic substances, as\nfound previously [24]. \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Jamie Lead for supplying the humic substances and NERC for funding a Fellowship for \nHao Zhang.\nREFERENCES\n1.
