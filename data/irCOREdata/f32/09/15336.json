INTRODUCTION\nInterest in the properties of disordered photonic crystals\n\u00031,2\u0004 has arisen for various reasons, including the necessity\nto produce photonic crystals for technical applications,\nwhose photonic band gap \u0001PBG\u0002 will not be significantly\ndegraded \u0001filled with photonic states\u0002 due to disorder, and\nalso because of the possibility of light localization in such\nstructures \u00033\u0004. Despite the continual enhancement in the tech-\nnology of photonic crystal fabrication, samples are inevitably\ndisordered to a greater or lesser extent. For example, in self-\norganized photonic crystals, such as opals, the size of the\nspheres tends to vary, and photonic crystals produced by li-\nthography are not ideal due to the roughness of the walls and\nthe nonuniformity in the depth of the etched elements.\nIt has been known for a long time that disorder in semi-\nconductors can lead to the localization of carriers, which is\nmanifested in a decrease of electric conductivity \u00034,5\u0004. For\nexample, the impurity band of a lightly doped, nearly com-\npensated n-type semiconductor at low temperature is disor-\ndered due to the random locations of the impurities and is\noccupied by electrons at a density small compared to that of\nthe impurity centers because of the compensation. In such a\nsystem, the relatively low density of electrons means that\nelectron-electron interactions can be neglected and the low\ntemperature results in a low level of phonon scattering, and\nlocalization of electrons due to disorder can be observed.\nAlthough not directly applicable to the semiconductor im-\npurity band, the Anderson model provides an elegant picture\nof how electron localization can occur in a disordered elec-\ntronic system. According to the one-dimensional Anderson\nmodel, an electron placed in a sequence of quantum wells is\nlocalized even for a small disorder. In mathematical language\nthe latter means that even for small fluctuations of the energy\nlevels of the individual quantum wells in an infinite one-\ndimensional system, the wave function of the electron decays\nexponentially with distance from a certain bounded domain\nin space.\nMore recently it has been proposed, that a related\nphenomenon\u2014localization of photons\u2014can be observed in\ndisordered dielectric structures \u00036\u0004. To describe photon local-\nization it initially seemed natural to use analogies with the\ntheory of electrons in solids, since the electromagnetic field\nand the quantum mechanics of electrons are both governed\nby wave equations and the theory of electron localization\nwas already well developed \u00037,8\u0004 and provided a good de-\nscription of experimentally observed phenomena.\nHowever, there are important differences between the\nwave equation for the electric field of light of angular fre-\nquency \u0001,\n\u0001\u0001 \u0002 \u0001\u0001 \u0002 E\u0001r\u0002 = \u0003\u0001r\u0002\n\u00012\nc2\nE\u0001r\u0002 \u00011\u0002\nor\n\u0001\u0001 \u0002 \u0001\u0001 \u0002 E\u0001r\u0002 + \u0003\u0003\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 1\u0004\n\u00012\nc2\nE\u0001r\u0002 =\n\u00012\nc2\nE\u0001r\u0002 \u00012\u0002\nspatial dependence of the dielectric constant \u0003\u0001r\u0002=\u0003per\u0001r\u0002\n+\u0003 fluct\u0001r\u0002 includes periodic \u0003per\u0001r\u0002 and random parts \u0003 fluct\u0001r\u0002,\nand the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for electrons of energy U\n*Corresponding author.

The potential V\u0001r\u0002 can be positive or negative,\nand V\u0001r\u0002 in \u00013\u0002 is independent of U. In contrast, the dielectric\nconstant \u0003\u0001r\u0002 in nonabsorbing media has a real positive value\nand enters in \u00011\u0002 as a product with \u00012. It follows that for an\nelectron of energy U, a potential can exist where in the local\nsurrounding region V\u0001r\u0002\u0006U. Furthermore, states with values\nof an energy less than the mean potential of the system can\noccur. For photons the analogous situation is not possible. In\nparticular, the Anderson model is not a suitable analog of a\ndisordered photonic system since it starts from the existence\nof localized electron states in individual quantum wells. Nev-\nertheless, coherent backscattering \u0001weak localization of pho-\ntons\u0002 \u00039\u201311\u0004, which is assumed to be a precursor of \u201creal\nlocalization,\u201d has been observed experimentally, which sup-\nports the hypothesis that light localization in dielectric disor-\ndered structures is possible.\nFrom the fundamental point of view another important\ndifference between disordered photonic and electronic sys-\ntems is that the former are in many ways easier to study\nexperimentally. The behavior of the electrical conductivity\ncan be used to detect and probe electron localization but the\neffects of the phenomenon in many systems are obscured by\nthe electron-electron interaction, phonon scattering, the con-\ntacts, and the fact that the current measured is usually the\nresultant effect of many electrons. In contrast, photon-photon\nscattering does not occur in linear optical media and scatter-\ning by phonons is negligible. Further, the coherence of the\nphotonic states is conserved across a typical photonic micro-\nstructure and it is possible to detect photons in a single or\nsmall number of modes. However, optical measurements on\nphotonic structures do raise the question of what is meant by\na localized state in a finite system, and also how do we know\nwhen we have observed one \u000312\u0004. For example transmission\nexperiments can produce what at first sight are counterintui-\ntive results, such as near 100% transmission, independent of\nsample length, that occur at frequencies close to localized\nphotonic states.\nLocalization of photons can be achieved in microcavities\n\u000313\u0004, which are isolated defects \u0001for example, a half-wave\nlayer\u0002 in a photonic crystal \u0001such as a Bragg reflector, which\nis a periodic sequence of pairs of quarter-wave layers\u0002, where\nthe density of electromagnetic energy of an eigenmode \u0007\ndecays with position z relative to the microcavity as\n\u0007\u0001z\u0002 \b exp\u0001\u2212 \u0005z\u0005\/\t\u0002 , \u00014\u0002\nwhere \t is an attenuation length. As noted above, such a\nlocalized state manifests itself as a sharp peak in the trans-\nmission spectrum irrespective of sample thickness. On the\nother hand, the exponential decay of light transmission with\nsample thickness does occur when the frequency coincides\nwith the band gap of a photonic crystal, where there are in\nfact no states. Electrons exhibit analogous effects in semi-\nconductor superlattices, as long as extraneous scattering can\nbe avoided, but experimental observation is much more dif-\nficult. Obviously it is useful to carry out theoretical interpre-\ntation of the results of light transmission \u0001and reflection\u0002 ex-\nperiments and this can be done using standard\nelectromagnetic theory \u00036,14\u201318\u0004. However, it is also valu-\nable to consider more directly the properties of the states of a\nphotonic microstructure in a way which is dependent on the\nproperties of the system rather than any external stimulus.\nThis can be done by considering the states that exist when\noutgoing wave boundary conditions are applied. In this way\nwe can directly calculate the lifetimes of the states as well as\ntheir energies and electromagnetic field profiles. Further, the\noutgoing wave boundary conditions provide in principle an\nappropriate description of truly localized states in an infinite\nsystem, including their finite lifetime and the decaying pro-\nfile of the electromagnetic field.\nExperimental studies of light transmission in photonic\ncrystals have shown, that there is a dip in the transmission\nspectrum within the PBG. At the frequency of the dip, light\ndecays exponentially with distance and, hence, the transmis-\nsion decreases with increasing sample thickness, but the ef-\nfective attenuation length measured experimentally is gener-\nally larger than it should be for an ideal \u0001nondisordered\u0002\nstructure \u000319\u201323\u0004. However, it has been shown theoretically\nfor a one-dimensional disordered photonic crystal \u000324\u0004 that,\nif the level of disorder does not exceed a certain threshold\nvalue, a significant increase of the attenuation length with\nincrease of disorder does not occur. Similar results have also\nbeen obtained more recently for the two-dimensional case\n\u000325,26\u0004. On the basis of these results, a hypothesis was pro-\nposed that the PBG is filled by localized states only when the\ndisorder is above a certain threshold.\nThe aim of the present work is further investigation of the\nspectrum of optical eigenmodes in a one-dimensional disor-\ndered photonic crystal in the frequency region corresponding\nto the PBG, and the establishment of a relationship between\nthe transmission properties and the associated modifications\nto the eigenmode spectrum.\nII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nConsider the one-dimensional infinite periodic structure,\nshown in Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002, which is a sequence of pairs of layers A\nand B of the same thicknesses D \/2, whose refractive indices\nare\nnA,B\n\u00010\u0002\n= n0 \u00b1 g , \u00015\u0002\nwhere g is the modulation of the refractive index and n0 is\nthe average refractive index.

For the Fabry-P\u00e9rot modes of the\nuniform structure, the inverse lifetime is comparable to the\ninterval between modes, and hence, such states are delocal-\nized according to the Thouless criterion.

At the same time, the\ndensity of electromagnetic energy decays to the edges of the\nstructure more slowly than an exponential.\nIt is interesting to consider whether there is an upper limit\nfor the lifetime of the modes in such a structure. For an\nisolated defect \u0001microcavity\u0002 in the center of the ideal struc-\nture \u0001for example a layer of thickness D and refractive index\nnA\u0002, the profile of the density of electromagnetic energy of\nthe cavity eigenmodes would decay exponentially, as shown\nin Fig. 3, and such a mode would possess the maximum\nlifetime of around 19 000\/\u00010. In the transmission spectrum\nof such a structure there is a sharp spike at the center of the\nPBG, corresponding to the cavity eigenmodes, as shown in\nFig. 3.\nOn the right in Figs. 2\u0001b\u0002\u20132\u0001e\u0002, the solutions of Eq. \u00017\u0002 are\nplotted as (Re\u0001\u0001i\u0002 ,1 \/ Im\u0001\u0001i\u0002) for 103 disordered structures\nwith different configurations of the disorder characterized\n\r=0.035 \u0001b\u0002, 0.07 \u0001c\u0002, 0.1 \u0001d\u0002, and 0.15 \u0001e\u0002. The left-hand\nside of Figs. 2\u0001b\u0002\u20132\u0001e\u0002 show the density of states averaged\nover an ensemble of 104 structures for the three different\nmodels of disorder considered. The frequency separation of\nthe levels in the structures is about 0.004\u00010. Strictly\nspeaking, the density of states diagrams are histograms, but\nthe bin widths are sufficiently small \u0001less than the interval\nbetween eigenmodes\u0002 so that the histograms are close ap-\nproximations of the density of states curves. The only excep-\ntion is the ideal structure, where the density of states is ac-\ntually a set of Dirac delta functions. The densities of states\nfor \u201crefractive index\u201d and \u201cthickness\u201d disorder with a top-hat\ndistribution of Di are practically identical for a given value\nof \r, and very close to the case of \u201cGaussian\u201d distribution for\nall values of \r considered. Thus we conclude that the density\nof modes within the PBG of a one-dimensional disordered\nphotonic crystal is defined by the relative fluctuation of the\noptical length of one period of the structure.\nFor \r=0.035 the eigenfrequencies Re\u0001\u0001i\u0002 and their life-\ntimes \fi fluctuate near the values corresponding to the eigen-\nmodes of the ideal structure, but the fluctuations of the life-\ntime of the edge states near the PBG are larger than for those\nfurther away. It is apparent in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 that the profile of the\nenergy density \u0007 for a mode of the disordered structure is\nsimilar to the profile of the corresponding edge states of the\nideal structure. The delta functions in the density of states of\nthe perfect crystal are replaced by Gaussian peaks in Fig.\n2\u0001b\u0002, and the tails of the peaks penetrate beyond the edges of\nthe PBG. The shape of the tails within the PBG are described\nto a very high accuracy by the formula\n\u000f\t exp\n\u2212 \u0001\u0001 \u2212 \u0001e\u00022\n\u000e2\n\u000b , \u000111\u0002\nwhere \u0001e is the angular frequency of the relevant band edge\nin the crystal and \u000e is a penetration depth parameter deter-\nmined by the level of disorder. The tails of the density of\nmodes have the same form at higher levels of disorder, even\nwhen the width of the peaks exceeds the separation between\nmodes. Fits to the numerical results using Eq. \u000111\u0002 are shown\nin Fig. 2 for the various levels of disorder, along with the\nvalues of \u000e used. The penetration depth \u000e is found to be\nlinearly proportional to \r but does not depend on the length\nof the structure \u0001as is to be expected since the density of\nstates is a self-averaging quantity\u0002. When \u000e is much less\nthan half the PBG width, the probability of the appearance of\nmodes in the center of the PBG remains virtually negligible.\nWhen \r is increased to 0.07, Figs. 2 and 3 show that the\nedge states penetrate further into the PBG, the fluctuations of\nthe lifetime of the modes increase, and the profile of the\nstates differ markedly from the profiles of the edge states in\nthe ideal structure. The width of the PBG is significantly\nreduced but nevertheless remains substantial. Eventually,\nwhen \r is increased to 0.1 the probability of the appearance\nof eigenmodes in any part of the original PBG becomes con-\nsiderable and the fluctuations in the lifetimes of the eigen-\nstates are greater. For some of the states, the lifetime is com-\nparable to the lifetime of the microcavity mode and the\nprofile of one such mode is shown in Fig. 3. One can see,\nthat the profile of this mode is similar to that of the micro-\ncavity mode, in particular there is exponential decay, despite\nthe fact that the fluctuations in refractive index do not appear\nto provide isolated defects where light can be localized. Nev-\nertheless, at this level of disorder, it is apparent that not only\ndo shifted edge states appear in the PBG, but there are also\n\u201cstates localized in random microcavities\u201d characterized by\nlarge lifetimes.\nAn increase of \r to 0.15 leads to a decrease in the dip of\nthe density of states, an increase of the fluctuations of the\nlifetime, and a slight decrease of the mean value of the life-\ntime. Further increase of \r leads to the disappearance of the\neffects associated with the periodic modulation of the refrac-\ntive index, and the system becomes completely disordered.\nIn this regime the values of the lifetimes suggest that the\nmajority \u0001but not all\u0002 of these states are localized.\nIn the transmission spectra of Fig. 3, the eigenstates mani-\nfest themselves as spikes in the region of the PBG, and the\ngreater the lifetime, the sharper the spikes. In the PBG region\nthere is a dip in the transmission spectra averaged over an\nensemble of the structures, but with increasing \r the dip\nbecomes shallower, and its shape varies.\nBy modeling structures with different values of relative\nband width \u000b\u0001 \/\u00010 ranged in the interval from 0.004 to 0.16\n\u0001which corresponds to high refractive index contrast struc-\nture of experimental interest\u0002, we have found that the pen-\netration depth \u000e is proportional to the square root of the\nrelative gap width. However, \u000e is actually a function of the\nthree independent parameters \u000b\u0001, \u00010, and \r. In Fig. 4 the\ndimensionless quantity \u0001\u000e \/\r\u00010\u0002\f\u00010 \/\u000b\u0001 is plotted as a func-\ntion of the average refractive index in the structure n0, which\nis related to the frequency of the center of the PBG by the\nformula \u00010=\nc \/ \u0001n0D\u0002.

Note that the square root of the logarithm\nin Eq. \u000113\u0002 varies very slowly with the change of the argu-\nment, and the above estimate can be considered as an almost\nuniversal criterion for the stability of the PBG in one-\ndimensional photonic crystals in the presence of disorder.\nFigure 5 shows how the frequencies of the edges of the\nPBG \u0001determined by the penetration depth \u000e\u0002 vary with the\nvalue of the disorder parameter \r, for structures with differ-\nent levels of modulation of the refractive index \u0001g=0.025,\ng=0.05, and g=0.1\u0002.

At the edge\nof the PBG, \rT\u000e demonstrates more complicated behavior\nwhen \r is small; in this case \rT\u000e is determined by the fre-\nquency of an edge state, which depends on the thickness of\nsample L, but when \r is large enough \rT\u000e decays exponen-\ntially with increasing L.\nThe existence of a threshold level of disorder is illustrated\nin Fig. 7, where the dependences on the disorder parameter \r\nof the transmission coefficient \rT\u000e and its standard deviation\nat the center of the band gap for structures, characterized by\ndifferent refractive index modulation g are shown for the\nthree models of disorder. For all the cases considered the\ndependences are characterized by a threshold; when \r\u0010\rth,\n\rT\u000e grows slowly with increasing \r, and the attenuation\nlength \t virtually does not change. When \r reaches \rth, \rT\u000e\ngrows much faster with increasing \r. The threshold in the\ndependence of \rT\u000e on \r is accompanied by a crossing of \rT\u000e\nand its standard deviation; below threshold \rT\u000e is larger than\nits standard deviation, but smaller for \r\u0006\rth.

CONCLUSIONS\nFor the one-dimensional photonic crystals of finite size\nconsidered, the states closest to the band gap have frequen-\ncies and lifetimes which are defined by the periodic dielectric\nstructure and its length. The introduction of a small level of\ndisorder results in small perturbations of the frequencies and\nlifetimes of those states which depend on the particular con-\nfiguration of the disorder. As the disorder is increased, the\nfluctuations of the frequencies in an ensemble of systems\nincreases and eventually it is no longer possible to associate\na particular state with a counterpart in the crystalline system.\nThe tail of the density of states in the band gap is charac-\nterized by a certain penetration depth. As a result, there is a\nthreshold level of disorder, below which the probability of\nthe appearance of photonic eigenstates at the center of pho-\ntonic band gap essentially vanishes. The relation between the\nrelative penetration depth, relative gap width, and the param-\neter defining the level of disorder has been found.\nThe transmission spectrum of any individual disordered\nsample has a spiky appearance with substantial transmission\nat frequencies corresponding to states induced into band gap\nby the disorder. However, the attenuation length of the\nensemble-averaged transmission of radiation at the gap-\ncenter frequency does not grow significantly with increasing\ndisorder, and the standard deviation of the transmission is\nsmaller than its mean value until the threshold value of dis-\norder is reached. Beyond the threshold there is a fast growth\nof the attenuation length with increasing disorder reflecting\nthe increasing probability of a state being found at the gap\ncenter, and the standard deviation of the transmission ex-\nceeds its mean value.\nFinally, the results demonstrate how a simple formula re-\nlates the logarithm of the transmission to the level of peri-\nodic refractive index modulation and the disorder.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe work was supported by an EPSRC grant.
