The three arenas, their architecture and location within the city structure \nwere explicitly designed to contribute to revitalisation of their economically deprived \nneighbourhoods. We employ a difference-in-differences approach to check for \nstructural breaks in development of land values within areas of potential impact. Our \nresults suggest that arenas emanate positive externalities that improve location \ndesirability in their neighbourhoods. However, evidence also supports concerns that \nnegative external effects of arenas may adversely affect neighbourhoods, when not \naddressed appropriately during planning.  \nKeywords: Stadium Impact, Stadium Architecture, Location Desirability, Berlin \nJEL classification: R53, R58 \n1  Introduction \nInnovative architecture has long been associated with buildings designed to host \ncultural institutions like museums or theatres. Some of the most prominent \nexamples are the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the Centre Pompidou in Paris \nor the Sydney Opera House. However, more recently, architecture has also \nbegun to play an increasingly important role in construction of sports facilities. \nFor instance, some of the most recognised architects have been chosen to design \nthe Palau Sant Jordi Sports Palace in Barcelona (Arata Isozaki), the new \nWembley Stadium in London (Foster and Partners), Durban\u2019s Kingspark \nStadium (Gerkan Marg and Partners), Munich\u2019s Allianz-Arena and the Beijing \nNational Stadium (both Herzog and de Meuron). While these stadiums have \nobviously been designed with respect to appearance and aimed at creating new \nvisiting cards for their hometowns, scholarly debate on new stadium \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 2 \n 2\nconstruction still focuses on more traditional arguments. Accordingly, subsidies \nfor new stadiums are justified by potential increases in business and tourism, \nand the creation of construction jobs, which lead to increasing tax revenue and \neconomic stimulation of the host community. This reasoning, however, has been \ncriticised for unrealistic assumptions about multiplier effects, underestimation \nof substitution effects and neglecting opportunity costs (Baade, 1996; Noll and \nZimbalist, 1997; Rosentraub, 1997; Coates and Humphreys, 2000; Zaretsky, \n2001; Matheson, 2007). Siegfried and Zimbalist (2000) provide a good \noverview of this research. This criticism has been supported by numerous \neconometric ex-post studies (Baade, 1988; Baade and Dye, 1990; Baade and \nSanderson, 1997; Coates and Humphreys, 1999, 2003; Siegfried and Zimbalist, \n2006) and only few studies have found positive effects on MSA (Metropolitan \nStatistical Area) level (Baim, 1990; Carlino and Coulson, 2004). \nGenerally, neighbourhood activists oppose stadium construction, since they \nexpect property values to be adversely affected by emerging congestion \nproblems and annoying fan-crowds. Recently, stadium construction has been \nempirically investigated from the homeowners\u2019 perspective. Tu (2005) used \nproperty-transaction data and found a positive impact on property prices around \nFedEx Field in Prince Georges County, Maryland. Coates and Humphreys \n(2006) showed that voters in close proximity to facilities tend to favour \nsubsidies more than voters living farther from the facilities, indicating that \nbenefits from stadiums might exhibit an unequal spatial distribution. \nThese findings further inform the debate about impacts of stadium construction. \nNot only may stadium projects have been inadequately designed to improve \nneighbourhood quality and stimulate local economies, empirical studies have \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 3 \n 3\nprobably investigated impact at an unreasonable scale. With the exception of Tu \n(2005) the aforementioned studies all make use of aggregated data on MSA \nlevel although it had been recognised early in the debate that stadiums and \ncorresponding franchises might be too small as \u201cbusinesses\u201d to have effects at a \nhighly aggregated level (Rosentraub, 1997). \nMoreover, only empirical analysis on a neighbourhood-scale can assess whether \nnew stadiums are key-determinants in processes of urban renewal, particularly \nin economically deprived neighbourhoods. With few exceptions (Melaniphy, \n1996; Davies, 2006) this question has rarely been addressed in scholarly \ndiscussion. \nThis paper addresses the detail of how new sports facilities affect their \nneighbourhoods from an urban economic perspective. Real estate markets being \nin equilibrium, any increase in location desirability caused by development of \nsports facilities and surrounding urban spaces will thus be reflected in positive \nprice differentials. We conduct differences-in-differences analysis on a set of \nhighly disaggregated data, to assess impact of three sport arena projects \ndeveloped within an area of urban renewal. These projects were explicitly \ndesigned to contribute to a process of revitalisation, and realised during the \n1990s in downtown Berlin, Germany. Our results support positive expectations \nof stadium impacts, and also confirm that some concerns about congestion \nproblems are well-founded, when not appropriately addressed by planning \nauthorities.  \nThe article is organised as follows: Section 2 presents both projects in more \ndetail and emphasises their architectonical particulars. In section 3 and 4 the \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 4 \n 4\ndata and empirical strategy are discussed. In section 5 empirical results and \ninterpretation are presented. Section 6 contains the conclusion. \n2 Velodrom and Max-Schmeling-Arena \nWe investigate two sports complexes in the district of Prenzlauer-Berg, within \nthe boundaries of former East Berlin.2 Max-Schmeling-Arena and \nVelodrom\/Swimming-Arena were initially designed to fulfil all standards for \ninternational competitions, since they were an integral component of the \nunsuccessful bid of Berlin for the 2000 Olympics, commenced in the late 1980s. \nMax-Schmeling-Arena was intended for boxing competitions, while Velodrom \nand Swimming-Arena were intended for Olympic track cycling and aquatics, \nrespectively. To simplify matters hereafter Velodrom signifies Velodrom and \nSwimming-Arena, since Velodrom is the much larger of the two arenas, which \nare grouped together. \nThe ideas of the arenas need to be understood in the context of aspirations in \nBerlin of the early 1990s, shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The German \nParliament decided that Berlin would become the capital city of unified \nGermany and economic prospects were positive. Building activity was high and \nlarge residential areas formerly belonging to East Berlin started to be \nrevitalised. Many projects of this period, such as the government district and the \nlarge office and retail areas around Potsdamer Platz and Friedrichstrasse have \nbecome internationally prominent. It was a time of extraordinary projects. \nAn international competition awarded the Velodrom project to the design of \nDominique Perrault, an architect who had just become an international \n\u201cshooting-star\u201d due to his spectacular design for the new French National \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 5 \n 5\nLibrary. In contrast, the group of young architects around J\u00f6rg Joppien and \nAlbert Dietz was still internationally unknown when entrusted with the design \nof Max-Schmeling-Arena. Nevertheless, both architectural designs share the \nsame basic idea. Instead of placing monolithic blocks into densely populated \nresidential areas and threatening the fragile urban equilibrium, they decided for \na sensitive approach. They reduced the visible building volumes by sinking the \nfacilities into the earth and embedding the visible parts into park landscapes as \nrecreational spaces. Nonetheless, the architectonical quality of the remaining \nvisible parts and their appealing designs fitted well with the ambitions of \noriginality in Berlin at that time (Mandrelli, 1994; Adam, 1997; Meyer, 1997; \nArgenti, 2000; Myerson and Hudson, 2000; Perrault and Ferr\u00e9, 2002). \nThe arenas had been under construction for several months in 1993 when the \nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the 2000 Olympic \nGames would be in Sydney. Subsequently, building costs were reduced and \narchitects and engineers redesigned the arenas to be multi-purpose. \nNotwithstanding, the arenas were of extraordinary dimensions. The Velodrom \nroof has a diameter of 142 m and a clear span of 115.2 m, and is one of the \nlargest of its kind. It contains more than 3500 tonnes of steel, a similar quantity \nto the famous Eiffel Tower in Paris (Mandrelli, 1994; Cycling Stadium, 1997). \nSince Velodrom was sunk up to 17 m, it is virtually invisible from street level. \nAfter accessing a plateau, however, it is an impressive sight. Within a park of \n450 apple trees, the visitor suddenly catches sight of Velodrom and Swimming \nArena which protrudes above the surface by less than one metre.  \nAlthough smaller, the architectural concept of Max-Schmeling-Arena is special \nas well. Deutz and Joppien convinced the jury of the desirability of a green \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 6 \n 6\nbridge from Wedding to Prenzlauer Berg, providing additional green spaces for \na very densely populated area, and symbolically linking the two districts \nformerly divided by the Berlin Wall. The complex is embedded in a heap of \nWorld War II rubble with two thirds of its volume below street level. The \nbuilding has a tripartite structure consisting of a major arena in the centre, \nflanked by two aisles hosting additional sports facilities. A conventional steel \nroof covers only the middle part, while the tops of the two aisles are covered \nwith greenery. Being walkable and smoothly descending to street level, they fit \ninto the surrounding park landscape of the Mauerpark, one of Berlin\u2019s larger \ninner-city recreational spaces.  \nBoth projects have received important architectural awards. In 1999 the Jury of \nthe German Architectural Award gave the second prize to Dominique \nPerreault\u2019s plans for the Velodrom. The first prize went to no one less than \nDaniel Liebeskind with his plans for the Jewish Museum Berlin. Two years later \nthe exemplary design and function of Max-Schmeling-Arena received an \nIOC\/IAKS Gold medal. This prize, sponsored by the IOC and the International \nAssociation for Sports and Leisure Facilities is the only international \narchitectural prize explicitly awarded to operating sports and leisure facilities. \nVelodrom and Max-Schmeling-Arena are comparable in terms of \narchitectonical quality and concept, which also includes a radical low-energy \nphilosophy, and also in size. Velodrom has a capacity for 11500 spectators \nwhile Max-Schmeling-Arena accommodates up to 10000 in the main arena. \nBoth complexes also host a wide range of sports facilities for non-professional \nsports. Accessibility by public transport was an important determinant for both \nlocations. Velodrom is immediately accessible by tram and the circular line of \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 7 \n 7\nthe suburban railway network (S-Bahn). Another S-Bahn station is within 800 \nm of Max-Schmeling-Arena, as well as four underground and various tram \nstations. No further improvement of transport infrastructure was needed. \nMax-Schmeling-Arena was finished in 1997 and Velodrom in 1999. They were \nfinanced by state funds and planned and carried out by a building-property \ncompany founded by the Senate and Chamber of Deputies of Berlin. Overall \nexpenditure was $118 Million (205 Million DM, current prices) for Max-\nSchmeling-Arena, and for Velodrom a total of over $295 Million (545 Million \nDM) (Myerson and Hudson, 2000; Perrault and Ferr\u00e9, 2002).3 Projects of this \nsize would not have occurred if ordered by club owners or managers purely \naiming at private profitability. There was a clear attempt to generate positive \nexternal effects by providing valuable recreational spaces and sports facilities \nfor the residents, by creating landmarks which signalled a clear new direction in \nthat urban area and to attract tourists.  \n3 Data \nFor reasons discussed below, we restrict our study area to the area of Prenzlauer \nBerg, which on 31 December 2005 had 141 210 inhabitants and an area of only \n11 km2, one of Berlin\u2019s highest population densities. We use standard land \nvalues that reveal market values for undeveloped properties as the primary \nendogenous variable. Standard land values are aggregated market values for \nproperties lying within block boundaries and are provided for zones of similar \nuse and valuation, assessed on the basis of statistical evaluation (including \noutlier elimination) of all transactions during the reporting period. Property \ntransactions where extreme prices are realised due to unrepresentative \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 8 \n 8\nparticularities are excluded to avoid bias. Following aggregation, standard land \nvalues are traditionally smoothed. For the purpose of identifying an amenity \neffect related to the presence of arenas, standard land values are appropriate to \nidentify changes in location desirability over time, since their application \nguarantees that any positive impact is driven by an increase in overall location \ndesirability, rather than by transactions of individual properties that might \nexhibit a particularly strong price reaction be particularly due to special use. \nStandard land values provided by committees of valuation experts are highly \nregarded among Germany\u2019s real estate community. These committees were \nestablished in the late 1950s and their expertise has enjoyed an unquestioned \nreputation since that time. Standard land values have an increasingly important \nrole within the German taxation system, e.g. for the determination of inheritance \nand land taxes. Due to the widely recognized reliability of standard land values, \nthere are recommendations in the property management literature to replace the \npresent combined tax on land and buildings by a simple model based \nexclusively on standard land values (Weiss, 2004). Floor-space-index (FSI) \nvalues give information on the legal density of development for all zones. To \naccount for individual zoning regulations, adjustment coefficients allow \nrevaluation of particular plot\u2019s FSIs.4  \nThe study period was from 31 December 1992 (the first year of available data \nfor districts in former East Berlin) to 1 January 2006, when the most recent data \nwas available. Analysis is on the basis of the official block structure of Berlin, \nin December 2005, this is the highest level of data disaggregation from the \nStatistical Office of Berlin. Thus Prenzlauer Berg consists of 376 blocks with a \nmedian surface area of less than 14 000 m2, corresponding to a typical \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 9 \n 9\ndowntown block of houses. The mean population of 258 populated blocks was \n545 (median 457) at the end of 2005. Use of GIS-tools and a projected GIS-map \nof the official block structure bring in the geographic dimension.5 Data on motor \nvehicle registrations and population demographic characteristics data at block-\nlevel were obtained from the Statistical Office of Berlin. Based on the City and \nEnvironmental Information System of the Senate Department a set of variables \nrepresenting typical residential building structure at block level is created using \nGIS tools.  \nWe collect data for 1992, 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2005.6 This is a reasonable \nchoice since it allows comparison of trends during pre- and post-completion \nperiods and consideration of novelty effects limited to the period immediately \nfollowing arena inauguration. \n4 Empirical Strategy \nIf arena construction significantly contributed to an improvement in \nneighbourhood quality one might expect increased land values in close \nproximity, relative to those at greater distances. Our empirical strategy consists \nof comparing growth rates of land values before and after arena completion. We \nemploy a differences-in-differences approach (Galster, Tatian, and Smith, 1999; \nEllen, Schill, Susin, and Schwartz, 2001; Galster, Tatian, and Pettit, 2004; \nRedding and Sturm, 2005; Tu, 2005) to assess whether impact areas \nsystematically experienced increased relative growth rates following arenas\u2019 \ninaugurations. Stated simply, we estimate differences-in-differences as we \ndifferentiate both across space (treatment areas and control areas) and time (pre-\ncompletion, inauguration and post-completion). Galster, Tatian and Pettit (2004) \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 10 \n 10\nprovide a survey about the appropriate application of differences-in-differences \nestimations. Three interesting differences-in-differences specifications are \nbriefly discussed and applied by Ellen, Schill, Susin and Schwartz (2001).  \nOne crucial part of any differences-in-differences study is defining treatment \nand control areas. Since reunification, Berlin has experienced overwhelming \nchanges in spatial structure and distinct socioeconomic developments. Processes \nof gentrification and catch-up, particularly within selected eastern districts and \nareas close to the old border, are matched by segregation and ongoing decline in \nother parts. The functional reactivation of the traditional eastern CBD, extensive \nmigration and immigration of people of distinct social milieus from and into \nparticular boroughs all complicate assessing feasible counterfactuals. These \nprocesses are of special importance for this analysis since both arenas are in \nPrenzlauer Berg, one of 23 boroughs according to pre-2001 legal definition,7 \nand a borough not representative of Berlin in population composition. Figures \n2a and 2b show how demographic structure changed after reunification, and \nhow this differs to the rest of Berlin. The figures reflect a major process of \nurban renewal in Prenzlauer Berg with the influx of relatively young \nprofessionals, usually in search of the particular urban lifestyle and scenic spirit \nfor which Prenzlauer Berg is now recognised. \nAs a consequence we restrict our analysis to the area of Prenzlauer Berg that has \nbeen similarly affected by overall socioeconomic shocks. Moreover, since \nPrenzlauer Berg lies more-or-less along a concentric distance ring around CBD-\nEast there is no concern of potential bias caused by control and treatment areas \nbeing affected asymmetrically by re-emergence of the CBD-East. \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 11 \n 11\nAs noted above, the basic idea behind our differences-in-differences approach is \nto test for structural breaks in relative growth of land values within impact-\nareas. Compound annual growth rates of standard land values within areas in \nimmediate proximity of Max-Schmeling-Arena and Velodrom are compared to \nthose of the control area within a comparable neighbourhood of Prenzlauer \nBerg. We use a similar specification to Redding and Sturm (2005). In our \nbaseline differences-in-differences specification, compound annual block \ngrowth rates of land values are pooled over 1992\u20131996, 1996\u20131998, 1998\u20132000 \nand 2000\u20132005, where 1996\u20131998 and 1998\u20132000 are the respective periods of \ninauguration for Max-Schmeling-Arena and Velodrom, which are denoted by \ndummy variables In_MAt and In_Velot., Similarly post-completion periods from \n1996-2005 and 1998-2005 are denoted by Post_MSt and Post_Velot. We regress \nannualised growth rates (Growthit) on a full set of time dummies (dt), two area \nimpact dummies (Veloi, MSi) denoting blocks that lie within impact areas of \nVelodrom and Max-Schmeling-Arena, two post-area and two inauguration-area \ninteractive terms between the arena-impact dummies (Veloi, MSi) and the \ndummies representing post-completion periods and inauguration periods, \nrespectively. \nittitit\nititiiit\ndMSMSPostVeloVeloPost\nMSMSInVeloVeloInMSVeloGrowth\n\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\n\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b1\n++\u00d7+\u00d7+\n\u00d7+\u00d7++=\n)_()_(\n)_()_(\n21\n2121 (1) \nTime dummies control for common overall impacts at district level. Coefficients \n\u03b11 and \u03b12 on impact area dummies represent differences in growth rates for \ntreatment blocks before arenas\u2019 inaugurations. Post-area interactive terms \ncapture impacts on relative growth rates following completion. Coefficients \u03b31 \nand \u03b32 represent persistent changes in differences between growth rates of \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 12 \n 12\nimpact relative to control areas after completion. For instance, positive values \nfor \u03b31 and \u03b32 would strongly indicate a positive impact on average growth rates \nof land values in close arena proximity during the post-completion period. \nCoefficients \u03b21 and \u03b22 on inauguration-area interactive terms capture any \nadditional impact within periods immediately following inauguration. Positive \nvalues for \u03b21 or \u03b22 indicate that arenas, regardless of possible effects on long-\nterm trends, have persistent level effects on property prices. \nOur specification allows for unobserved block fixed effects in standard land \nvalue levels, thereby implicitly controlling for neighbourhood characteristics \nthat remained unchanged over the period of observation. In contrast to most \ncomparable projects, improvement in land values cannot be attributed to \nimprovements in public transportation infrastructure following stadium \nconstruction. Both sites were chosen due to their extraordinary transport \nlinkages, making subsequent improvements unnecessary. Robustness checks are \nprovided to account for changes in location characteristics, such as changes in \nlegal density of development and changing preferences towards building \nstructure. Alternative treatment groups are also considered to control for barriers \npreventing external effects from spilling over. Treatment effects are reflected by \nsignificant coefficients on interactive terms \u03b2x and \u03b3x. Model alterations \nexplaining treatment effects will lead to insignificant \u03b2x and \u03b3x.  \n5 Empirical Results \nOur baseline differences-in-differences specification compares relative growth \ntrends of land values for the two study areas before and after arena completion, \nwhile controlling for common changes affecting all of Prenzlauer Berg. If \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 13 \n 13\nVelodrom and Max-Schmeling-Arena had a positive impact on location \ndesirability, this would be reflected in a post-completion increased growth of \nblocks within impact areas, relative to the control group. As previously \ndiscussed we restrict our study area to Prenzlauer Berg to maintain \nhomogeneity. We split Prenzlauer Berg into three parts: two treatment areas \neach defined by 1000 m distance rings surrounding arenas, and the control \ngroup consisting of the remaining area. The locations of Velodrom and Max-\nSchmeling-Arena and the surrounding distance rings are in Figure 3. Blocks are \nassigned to areas according to the location of their geographic centroids. There \nis evidence in the literature that stadiums may have an impact on the \nsurrounding area at distances of up to of 5000 m (Tu, 2005). However, beside \nthe fact that our study arenas are much smaller and expected to have a more \nlimited economic impact, our main concern is the contribution of sophisticated \narchitecture and urban design to location desirability. The new urban spaces \nrepresent an amenity that is basically enjoyed by residents within walking \ndistance. Therefore, as discussed below, the 1000 m distance ring corresponds \napproximately to a 1500 m effective road distance and, hence, represents a \nfeasible region of influence. \nTable 1 presents our baseline differences-in-differences results. Column (1) \nrefers to equation (1). Estimation is repeated with reduced sets of variables \nreferring either to Max-Schmeling Arena (2) or Velodrom (3). The general \npattern of results remains unchanged, indicating robustness of estimates.  \nAs initially noted, both Max-Schmeling-Arena and Velodrom were initiated in \nthe post-unification state of euphoria, when Berlin was still expected to rapidly \nregain economic strength. This short period was accompanied by a boom in real \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 14 \n 14\nestate markets, the following disillusionment regarding the general economic \nprospects of Berlin led to easing of markets towards a lower equilibrium. The \nsignificantly negative coefficients on time dummies after 1996 reveal that, \ndespite ongoing modernisation, Prenzlauer Berg was affected by this overall \ndepreciation. \nThe negative coefficient on Velo demonstrates that the Velodrom treatment area \nperformed poorly relative to the control group before the arena\u2019s completion. \nAfter completion there is a positive impact on relative growth rates of land \nvalues, represented by the positive coefficient on Post_Velo \u00d7 Velo interactive \ndummy. The implication is that after completion the Velodrom impact area \nexperienced average growth rates approximately 2% higher than pre-completion \ntrends would have predicted. In contrast, for Max-Schmeling-Arena we only \nobserve a short-run impact of about 1.3% represented by the coefficient on \nIn_MS \u00d7 MS. Coefficients on MS and Post_MS \u00d7 MS are not significant at \nconventional levels, indicating that the treatment area of Max-Schmeling-Arena \nperformed inline with the control area before completion and that there is no \npersistent impact on growth trend after inauguration. Based on column (1) \nestimates of Table 1, Figure 4 represents indices of land value development for \ntreatment areas relative to control group. Counterfactuals I indicate how indices \nwould have developed if pre-completion trends had continued. Similarly, \ncounterfactual II for Max-Schmeling-Arena represents the scenario where short-\nterm impact on growth rates remains persistent during long run. \nStandard land values refer to typical legal densities of development represented \nby FSI-values. To ensure that changes in legal building densities do not bias \nestimates, we repeat our baseline estimation employing land values normalised \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 15 \n 15\nto a FSI of 1.5, the approximate average density of development within the area. \nResults are presented in column (2) of Table 2. The process of normalisation is \ndescribed in more detail in the data appendix. \nTable 1 estimates correspond to treatment areas MS and Velo defined on the \nbasis of straight-line distances. However, natural and unnatural barriers may \nprevent arenas\u2019 external effects from spreading concentrically, as some \nproperties at similar straight-line distance may be characterised by distinct \neffective road distances. For instance, the suburban railway line passing close to \nboth facilities can only be crossed at designated bridges, although crossovers are \nprovided at relatively short intervals. Thus, in Table 2, column (2), we define \nalternative treatment areas relying on effective road distances. As blocks\u2019 road \ndistances to arenas on average were approximately 1.5 times the straight-line \nlengths, MS_Road and Velo_Road denote blocks lying within 1500 m of \neffective road distance to the respective arena. \nIn column (3) of Table 2, we focus on the \u201cold\u201d urban fabric of Wilhelminian \nperiod tenement blocks, which deserves special attention for two reasons: \nFirstly, as suggested by Figure 2b, Prenzlauer Berg, since the early 1990s \nexperienced an overwhelming change in resident composition. Secondly, the old \nbuildings, which had been desolate after unification, have largely been \nmodernized during our observation period. Both effects may have led to \nincreasing desirability of this particular building structure. If attractiveness \nsubstantially increased during our observation period and arena\u2019s \nneighbourhoods are characterized by a particularly old building structure, then \nincreased location desirability may be erroneously attributed to arenas\u2019 \nappealing architecture and challenging design of urban recreational spaces \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 16 \n 16\ninstead of changing preferences towards the surrounding developments. In \ncolumn (3) of Table 2, we introduce a set of interactive terms between time \ndummies and a dummy variable denoting all blocks, that according to the Urban \nand Environmental Information System (Senatsverwaltung f\u00fcr Stadtentwicklung \nBerlin 2006) of the Senate Department are characterised by a predominantly \npre-1920s building structure. These terms pick up effects of increased \ndesirability capitalising into differences in growth of property prices. However, \nresults represented in column (3) of Table 2 suggest that old housing blocks \nconsiderably outperformed their newer counterparts only during the early period \nafter unification from 1992 to 1996, when annualised growth rates were 1.3% \nlarger. During the following periods differences are, if significant, much lower. \nMoreover, column (3) results reveal the pattern of estimated impact coefficients \nremains virtually unchanged, providing evidence for treatment effects not being \ncaused by preexisting building structure. The only considerable change \nfollowing the introduction of time-building-structure interactive terms is the \ncoefficient on MS becoming weakly statistically significant and negative. This \nreveals that, accounting for surrounding building structure, relative growth rates \nwithin impact area of Max-Schmeling-Arena were slightly smaller than the \ncontrol area before the arena\u2019s inauguration. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 2 tell \nthe same story as column (3), indicating robustness of estimates. \nBefore arenas\u2019 completions, Velodrom treatment area performed poorly \ncompared to that of Max-Schmeling-Arena and the control area. After \ninauguration, our results suggest a larger impact of Velodrom on property prices \ncompared to Max-Schmeling-Arena. These effects may be conclusive when \nconsidering that before development of Velodrom the site was occupied by \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 17 \n 17\nWerner-Seelenbinder-Arena, a multifunctional sports-arena comparable to \nVelodrom in size and utilisation, but not architectural quality. If the removal of \nWerner-Seelenbinder-Arena has led to a decline in location desirability, then the \nfunctional reactivation of a traditional local amenity could have additional \nimpact.  \nBesides apparently having smaller short-run impact compared to Velodrom, the \nimpact of Max-Schmeling-Arena is found to have no significant long-term \nimpact on growth rates. This indicates considerable disillusionment following a \nshort period of relatively increased demand. Counterfactual II in Figure 4 \nillustrates how property prices would have developed if short-term impact on \ngrowth rates had endured. Considering that no comparable decline was found \nfor Velodrom and assuming positive externalities of both arenas to be \ncomparable, this disillusionment might be explained by negative externalities \n(Galster, Tatian, and Pettit, 2004) surrounding Max-Schmeling-Arena. There \nare at least two potential sources: the presence of highly involved fan-groups8 \nand problems related to congestion, particularly parking scarcity.  \nSince Prenzlauer Berg is in the most densely populated area of Berlin, much \nattention was paid to avoiding increased traffic volume. One of the main \nplanning objectives was to have close to 100% of spectators arriving by public \ntransport. To increase attractiveness of public transport and to minimise \nincentives for spectators to arrive by car, planning authorities did not provide \nadditional parking facilities.9 Despite reasonably low attractiveness of \nindividual transportation, a considerable amount of visitors still arrive by car. \nFor Max-Schmeling-Arena, local district authorities contracted an expert who \ncame to the conclusion that 20\u201360% of spectators arrived by car, depending on \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 18 \n 18\nthe event.10 As a consequence, an undeveloped plot of land close to Velodrom \nwas transformed into a car-park to address any future congestion. Since no \ncomparable reserve spaces were available in close proximity to Max-\nSchmeling-Arena, the increasing scarcity of parking soon led to anger among \nresidents. Construction of multi-storey car parks was considered, but projects \nwere not financially viable. The lack of solutions produced some curious \nattempts to deal with the problem. To keep spectators from arriving by car, the \nSenate Department unsuccessfully tried to confuse drivers by not installing \ntraffic signs indicating the way to Max-Schmeling-Arena (Meyer, 1997). No \nsolution to the problem is expected in the near future. A more detailed \ndiscussion of residents\u2019 complaints is provided by the local tenants association \n(Schuster, 2004). These negative experiences have already led to a rethink of \nplanning authorities. O2 World, a new multipurpose arena under construction \non the riverbank of the Friedrichshain district is intended to serve as an anchor \nstructure for presently the largest project of urban renewal in Berlin. O2 World, \nwith a capacity of 17,000 seats, will be the largest multipurpose area in Berlin \nwhen inaugurated by the end of 2008. Although, very optimistically, 83% of \nspectators are expected to arrive by means of public transport, the traffic \nplanners of FSG City and Traffic Research and Planning have foreseen the need \nfor at least 1200 parking spaces to avoid a negative impact on the attractiveness \nof the new district (Schmidt, 2004). \nAhlfeldt and Maennig (2008) have shown that there is a positive and highly \nsignificant relationship between car registrations per capita and property prices \nin Berlin. The parking scarcity within the neighborhood of the Max Schmeling \nArena potentially affected land values by keeping away car-owning households, \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 19 \n 19\nwhich potentially belong to relatively higher income groups and, hence, led to \nan adverse impact on land values. Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics for \nper capita car registrations at block level for the years 2000 and 2005. Mean car \nnumbers of the control group increased significantly between 2000 and 2005. In \n2000, car numbers in the impact area of the Max Schmeling Arena were \ncomparable to the control area, but by 2005 they had declined by approximately \none-third in comparison to the control area. At the same time car numbers close \nto Velodrom had increased relative to the control group.11 No records on car \nregistrations are available before 2000, therefore we were unable to check for \npre-completion trends, which could have provided additional valuable insights. \nHowever, the results support that owning cars has become considerably less \nattractive in close proximity to Max-Schmeling-Arena during the period of \nrelatively lower growth rates. Inadequate parking may not only affect the \nresident population. Baade (2000) found that in the case of Seattle\u2019s Kingdome, \nsurrounding ethnic restaurants, art galleries, professional services, legal services \nand most retailers reported declines in their business due to difficulties in \nmeeting clients on game days. \nAfter all, our results might be interpreted in a way that inauguration of Max-\nSchmeling-Arena and Velodrom has led to residents and business perceiving \nsubstantial improvements in location desirability, which capitalised into \nproperty prices. Velodrom apparently has a persistent effect counteracting the \nnegative pre-completion trend possibly caused by removal of a pre-existent \nsports arena. In the case of Max-Schmeling-Arena, after a significantly positive \nimpact following inauguration, residents appear to have become aware of \nproblems related to congestion. By becoming less attractive for car-owners, \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 20 \n 20\nhouseholds of potentially relatively higher income might be kept away, leading \nto a negative impact on property prices and neutralising positive externalities \nemanated by Max-Schmeling-Arena. \nAll three arenas were planned with a quality of the architectural design that \nshould enhance positive spillovers to their neighbourhoods. In our model, we \ncould not isolate the effects of the architectural design from the effects of the \narenas per se. We nevertheless can conclude that\u2014if such effects of \u201ciconic \nbuildings\u201d exists\u2014the three Berlin arenas did not have adequate architectural \ndesign quality or the effects of the architecture are not large enough to assure an \neffect on the development of the neighbourhoods, which differs significantly \nfrom arenas with no special architectural design. In the case of Max-Schmeling- \nArena, effects are low anyway. In the case of Velodrom, effects are not very \ndifferent from the Washington FedEx Field which has no special architectural \nfeatures and which was examined by Tu (2005). However, the maximum \ncapacities of Max-Schmeling-Arena and Velodrom of around 10000 spectators \nare small compared to FedEx field with almost 80000.  \n6 Conclusion \nThis paper contributes to the debate on stadium impact by providing an \nempirical analysis on how three arenas of sophisticated design improved \nlocation desirability within a formerly deprived inner-city area. Two \nmultifunctional sports complexes in Prenzlauer Berg were chosen for their \noutstanding architecture and potential to improve neighbourhood quality. In \naddition to being comparable in size, architectural concept and utilisation, \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 21 \n 21\nVelodrom and Max-Schmeling-Arena were developed at almost the same time \nand within the same general neighbourhood. \nApplication of highly disaggregated data allows comparisons of relative land \nvalue trends within impact-neighbourhoods, before and after completion, with a \ndetermined control-area while capturing short-run novelty effects. Results \nsuggest that with appropriate choice of location and adequate arena design and \nsurrounding urban spaces, positive effects on neighbourhoods are to be \nexpected. The restoration of a pre-existent equilibrium by developing Velodrom \non an area formerly occupied by a multifunctional sports arena, has led to a \nstronger reaction than construction of Max-Schmeling-Arena, where no similar \nfacility previously existed. Moreover, Max-Schmeling-Arena\u2019s construction is \nfound to have impacts limited to a short period after inauguration with no \nsignificant impact on long-term growth trend. However, this is not necessarily \nattributable to noisy fans, or to inadequate or unappealing appearance. Indeed, \npositive effects on location desirability appear to have been neutralised by \ncongestion problems, which could have been avoided by providing an \nunderground car park.  \nThese results bring a new dimension into the discussion on stadium impact at \nneighbourhood scale. Stadium impact is typically regarded with skepticism both \nby neighborhood activists opposing stadium construction in proximity to their \nproperties and scholars who rarely find positive economic impacts. Previous \nresearch (Baade, Nikolova, and Matheson, 2006) found that even those stadiums \nwell integrated into the local urban grid may have an ambivalent economic \nimpact, since they induce economic development which might not be in the best \ninterest of the neighbourhood. Considering this skepticism, the dimension of \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 22 \n 22\nquality of architecture and urban design of sports arenas has to be emphasised. \nEven Max-Schmeling-Arena, although causing typical problems of congestion, \ndoes have a significantly positive impact that is not removed in the long-run. \nMoreover, Figure 4 suggests that impact could have been even stronger if \ncongestion problems had been addressed. Thus, our results indicate that well \ndesigned sports arenas may substantially improve location desirability. This \nmight well be an objective on its own for planning authorities, justifying public \nexpenditures even if econometric ex-post studies so far have tended to find no \ntraditional economic impact in terms of income, employment and taxes (Baade, \n1988; Baade and Dye, 1990; Baade and Sanderson, 1997; Coates and \nHumphreys, 1999, 2003; Siegfried and Zimbalist, 2006).  \nOur empirical model attributes land value variation spatially and temporally to \nthe construction of arenas. Thus, we conclude that our results indicate that the \nobjective to contribute to an increase in a neighbourhood\u2019s location desirability \nwas achieved. However, we cannot state definitively whether it was the \ninvestment in sophisticated architecture that generated the positive effects, as \nwe cannot separate effects of architecture from those of the original functions of \nsports facilities. Nevertheless, due to the limited size of the study arenas, it is \nunlikely that positive impacts are caused mainly by an increase in economic \nactivity within the neighborhood, as argued by Tu (2005). More empirical \nevidence is needed to gain useful insights from comparing the results of \ndifferent case studies. We therefore recommend that future analyses of stadium \nconstruction impacts are conducted with an emphasis on architectural quality \nand urban design of the venues under consideration. After all, our results should \nencourage authorities following a strategy of supporting redevelopment of \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 23 \n 23\ndeprived urban areas with sports facilities\u2019 construction as attempted for the \nforthcoming Olympic Games 2012 in London. However, to address whether \ncities should pay for sports facilities or not (Zaretsky, 2001), we emphasise that \nthis depends largely on the kind of proposed stadium. Is it within a \nneighborhood that is in need of revitalization? Have potential negative \nexternalities been dealt with satisfactorily? Most importantly, is the project \nlikely to be perceived as a location amenity due to a comprehensive urban \ndesign?  \nA Data Appendix \nWe collected data on standard land values and FSI-values from atlases of \nstandard land valuation (Bodenrichtwertatlanten) (Senatsverwaltung 1993, \n2001, 2006). The Committee of Valuation Experts in Berlin has been publishing \nthese atlases at intervals of one to four years, since 1967. \nLocal Committees of Valuation Experts were established throughout Germany \nto provide market transparency in real estate markets, which returned to a \nsystem of market economies during the late 1950s. Previously, German real \nestate markets had undergone a period of intense regulation begun in WWI with \nthe first rental fee regulation and culminating in 1936, during the period of the \n\u201cThird Reich\u201d, in a general price stop for all real estate assets. After WWII, \nregulation initially continued, since scarcity of living spaces made public \nprovision and allocation necessary. The Committee of Valuation Experts in \nBerlin was established in 1960 when the major price restrictions implemented in \n1936 were finally abolished. Apart from providing market transparency in \nderegulated markets, standard land values provided by the Committees of \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 24 \n 24\nValuation Experts play a role in determining tax burdens related to property \nownership. \nData collection was conducted by assigning values represented in atlases of \nstandard land valuation to a block-ID-key-variable determined by the official \nblock structure as defined in December 2005. If more than one value was \nprovided by an atlas of standard land valuation for one particular block, then an \naverage of the highest and lowest values was used. The Committee of Valuation \nExperts assesses standard land values with respect to area-typical densities of \ndevelopment, represented by FSI-values. To make sure that changes in values \nare not attributable to modified zoning regulation, but reflect changes in \nlocation desirability we normalised all standard land values to a FSI-value of \n1.5, a value that approximates the average for Prenzlauer Berg. To normalise \nvalues we used FSI adjustment coefficients (GFZ Umrechnungskoeffizienten) \nprovided in the respective atlases of standard land valuation. We used \ncoefficients given for areas of mixed use, which, according to the \nrecommendation of the Committee of Valuation Experts, are to be obtained by \naveraging coefficients given for residential areas and those provided for office \nand retail areas. Division of a given standard land value by an adjustment \ncoefficient, corresponding to the given area-typical FSI, yields the value that a \nplot of land had if the legal density of development corresponded to the FSI \nbase value in the Table of adjustment coefficients. Such a Table may easily be \nadjusted to any base value, which we chose to be 1.5. \nThe Committee of Valuation Experts was neither willing to offer information on \nthe underlying function of adjustment coefficients nor on the corresponding \nprocess of assessment. However, we were able to estimate the functional \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 25 \n 25\nrelationship between given FSI-values and coefficients in the adjustment table \nwith an R2 = 1.0. Estimation results suggest a concave impact of FSI on land \nvaluation, inline with theory. Having found the underlying functional form, \nadjustment coefficients could be determined and applied individually for all \nblocks and all years, thereby eliminating potential impact of changing FSI-\nvalues \nThe Role of Architecture on Urban Revitalization 26 \n 26\nLiterature \nAdam, H.

Although officially \nreferring the January 1 of 2001 and 2006, standard land values provided in these atlases are \nbased on data collected during reporting periods 2000 and 2005. \n7 End of 2001, 23 boroughs have been merged to 12 boroughs of approximately same \npopulation size. \n8 In contrast to Velodrom, Max-Schmeling-Arena is the home of two sports clubs of supra-\nregional importance. Resident teams are the basketball team of \u201cAlba Berlin\u201d and the handball \nteam of \u201cF\u00fcchse Berlin\u201d. \n9 The original plans for Max-Schmeling-Arena included an underground car park. These \nplans were abandoned after Berlin\u2019s bid for the 2000 Olympics was rejected by the IOC (Meyer, \n1997).  \n10 Quoted according to URL: http:\/\/www.bmp.de\/vorort\/9711\/s08.html (07.02.2007). \n11 It must be noted that this increase, as well as the relatively high level of per capita \nregistrations, may be at least partially attributable to the presence of single block showing an \nextremely high number of registrations in relation to the resident population. However, \ncomparing median values, which are less sensitive to extreme values, yields basically the \nsame results. This indicates that car numbers around Velodrom have remained virtually \nunchanged in relation to the control group, while the impact area of Max-Schmeling-Arena \nshows a considerable decline. \n \n \n \n \n"}
