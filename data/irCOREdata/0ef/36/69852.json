CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\n1. Introduction\nLet G be a finite group and k be a field of characteristic p > 0. An endotrivial\nkG-module is a finitely generated kG-module M whose k-endomorphism ring is\nisomorphic to a trivial module in the stable module category. That is, M is an\nendotrivial module provided Homk(M,M) \u223c= k \u2295 P where P is a projective kG-\nmodule. Now recall that as kG-modules, Homk(M,M) \u223c= M\u2217 \u2297k M where M\u2217 =\nHomk(M,k) is the k-dual ofM . Hence, the functor \u201c\u2297kM\u201d induces an equivalence\non the stable module category and the collection of all endotrivial modules makes up\na part of the Picard group of all stable equivalences of kG-modules. In particular,\nequivalence classes of endotrivial modules modulo projective summands form a group\nthat is an essential part of the group of stable self-equivalences.\nEndotrivial modules were first defined by Dade in [Da]. He demonstrated that for\np-groups, the endotrivial modules formed the building blocks of the endo-permutation\nmodules which he proved are the sources for the irreducible modules in finite p-\nnilpotent groups. Later, Puig proved that in fact, the source of a simple module\nof a finite p-solvable group is an endo-permutation module. Dade also showed that\nif G is an abelian p-group, then any endotrivial kG-module is the direct sum of\na syzygy of the trivial module (\u2126n(k) for some n, see Section 2 for a definition)\nand a projective module. More recently, the first author and The\u00b4venaz have given\ncomplete classification of the endotrivial modules for p-groups. The group T (G) of\nendotrivial modules is torsion-free except in the cases that the group G is cyclic,\nquaternion or semi-dihedral [CaTh2]. The torsion-free rank of T (G) was determined\nby Alperin [A]. The rank depends on the number of conjugacy classes of maximal\nelementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank 2. A complete set of generators for the\ngroup of endotrivial modules was given in [CaTh3, Ca2].\nThe purpose of this paper is to determine the group of endotrivial modules in the\ndefining characteristic for all finite groups of Lie type, including those of twisted type.\nIt is well understood that if G is an arbitrary finite group and M is an endotrivial\nkG-module, then both the Green correspondent and the source of M are endotrivial\nmodules. For this reason we first consider the endotrivial modules for a Sylow p-\nsubgroup U and its normalizer B, a Borel subgroup, of a given finite group G of Lie\ntype. For the unipotent and Borel subgroups we present a complete classification of\nthe endotrivial modules. For the finite groups G of Lie type, T (G) has rank one and\nis generated by the class of \u2126(k) except in cases where the Lie rank is small and the\nDate: February 10, 2007.\nResearch of the first author was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0401431.\nResearch of the third author was supported in part by NSF grant DMS-0400548.\n1\n2 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nfield of the group is close to the prime field. In these exceptional cases, we find the\nrank of T (G). It would seem that finding a complete set of generators for the group\nof endotrivial modules would require a more detailed knowledge of the cohomology\nring H\u2217(G, k) than is currently available.\nWe end this introduction with a specific guide to the results of the paper. The\ndefinitions and preliminaries are in Section 2. In the process of classifying the\nendotrivial modules for finite groups of Lie type, many of the results for p-groups are\nextended to arbitrary finite groups. We first introduce the group T (G) of endotrivial\nkG-modules and show that it is a finitely generated abelian group. Hence it is the\ndirect sum of its torsion subgroup TT (G) and a torsion-free subgroup TF (G) which\nwe identify with the image of the product of the restriction maps onto the groups of\nendotrivial modules of elementary abelian p-subgroups of G of p-rank at least 2 (cf.\nTheorems 2.2, 2.3). In Section 3, using methods as in [Ca2], we prove that Alperin\u2019s\ntheorem on the rank of T (G) holds also for all finite groups, not just p-groups.\nStarting in Section 4, we focus on the finite groups of Lie type. In Section 5, the\ncase where the Sylow p-subgroups are trivial intersection subgroups is considered.\nThe next two sections handle the larger groups, where it turns out that T (G) is\ncyclic. The torsion subgroup of the group of endotrivial modules is handled in\nSection 6, and the torsion-free rank of T (G) is dealt with in Section 7. In the last\nsection we look at the remaining cases, namely the three Chevalley groups of Lie\nrank 2.\nThe following statements summarize the results of our investigations.\nTheorem A:\n(a) If G is not of type A1(p) (p > 2),\n2A2(p), or\n2B2(2\n1\n2 ), then the torsion\nsubgroup TT (U) of T (U) is trivial, by the classification of endotrival modules\nover p-groups.\n(b) The torsion subgroup TT (B) of T (B) is isomorphic to the direct sum of\nTT (U) and the character group of the torus T \u223c= B\/U .\n(c) If G is not of type A1(p) (p > 2),\n2A2(p), or\n2B2(2\n1\n2 ), then the torsion\nsubgroup TT (G) of T (G) is trivial.\nThe exceptional cases mentioned in Theorem A are examined in detail in Proposi-\ntion 5.2. Part (b) of the theorem actually follows from general principles developed\nin Corollary 2.7. The torsion-free group TF (G) is described as follows.\nTheorem B: The ranks of TF (U), TF (B) and TF (G) are determined entirely\nby the number of conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of\np-rank 2 in the groups U, B and respectively G.\n(a) If G has type A1(p) (p > 2), or\n2B2(2\n1\n2 ), then TF (U), TF (B) and TF (G)\nare all trivial.\n(b) If G is one of the of the following, then the rank of TF (G) is explored in\ndetail in the designated statement:\n(i) for type A2(p), cf. 8.1,\n(ii) for type B2(p), cf. 8.2,\n(iii) for type G2(p), cf. 8.4,\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 3\n(iv) for type 2A2(p), cf. 5.4,\n(v) for type 2B2(2\na+ 1\n2 ) (for a \u2265 1), cf. Theorem 5.5,\n(vi) for type 2G2(3\na+ 1\n2 ) (for a \u2265 0), cf. Theorem 5.6.\n(c) In all the other cases, the ranks of TF (U), TF (B) and TF (G) are one.\n(Theorem 7.5).\n(d) A complete set of generators for TF (U) and TF (B) can be specified using\nTheorem 3.4.\nIt is worth stating that in the process of proving part (b) of Theorem B we\nenumerate the conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of G.\nThese conjugacy classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the components of\nthe maximal ideal spectrum VG(k) of the cohomology ring H\n\u2217(G, k) (cf. Section 3).\nHence the results are of some interest, independent of the structure of endotrivial\nmodules.\n2. Definitions and Preliminaries\nThroughout the paper we assume that k is an algebraically closed field of char-\nacteristic p > 0. The algebraic closure assumption is not really necessary, but it\nmakes the geometry easier and there is no loss in generality. For G a finite group,\nwe consider only finitely generated kG-modules. We begin with some general no-\ntation. Let mod(kG) denote the category of finitely generated kG-modules, and\nlet stmod(kG) denote the stable module category. That is, the category where the\nobjects are finitely generated kG-modules. The set of morphisms between objects\nM and N in the stable category is given as\nHomkG(M,N) = HomkG(M,N)\/PHomkG(M,N)\nwhere PHomkG(M,N) is the set of all homomorphisms that factor through some\nprojective module.\nSuppose thatM is a kG-module. If \u03d5 : P \u2192M is a projective cover ofM then we\nlet \u2126(M) denote the kernel of \u03d5. Similarly, we let \u2126\u22121(M) denote the cokernel of the\ninjection \u03d1 :M \u2192 Q where Q is the injective hull ofM . Both of these operators can\nbe iterated so that for n > 1, \u2126n(M) = \u2126(\u2126n\u22121(M)) and \u2126\u2212n(M) = \u2126\u22121(\u21261\u2212n(M)).\nThese modules are called the syzygies of M , and satisfy the following properties\n\u2126m(M)\u2297 \u2126n(N) \u223c= \u2126m+n(M \u2297N)\u2295 (proj) and (\u2126n(M))\u2217 \u223c= \u2126\u2212n(M\u2217)\nfor all kG-modules M and N and all integers m and n. Here, \u201c\u2297\u201d means tensor\nover the base field k, and \u201c( )\u2217\u201d indicates the k-dual. Also \u201c(proj)\u201d denotes some\nprojective module. The first statement is a consequence of the fact that the tensor\nproduct of any module with a projective module is a projective module.\nSuppose that H is a subgroup of G. IfM is a kG-module, then its restriction to a\nkH-module is denoted ResG,H(M). Likewise, if N is a kH-module then the induced\nmodule is IndGH(N)\n\u223c= kG\u2297kH N . When there is no chance of confusion we denote\nthe restriction of M to H by the simple notation MH .\nThe definition of an endotrivial module is as follows.\n4 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nDefinition 2.1. A kG-module M is endotrivial provided we have an isomorphism\nof kG-modules Homk(M,M) \u223c= k \u2295 (proj).\nSo M is an endotrivial module if its k-endomorphism ring is isomorphic to the\ntrivial module in stmod(kG). Recall that Homk(M,M) \u223c= M\u2217 \u2297M . Hence, we\nhave that if M is an endotrivial module then so are M\u2217 and \u2126n(M) for all integers\nn. In particular, any kG-module of dimension one and any \u2126n(k) is an endotrivial\nmodule.\nBy the Krull-Schmidt Theorem it can be seen that any endotrivial module is\nthe direct sum of an indecomposable endotrivial module and a projective module.\nThus, we may define an equivalence relation on endotrivial modules, by saying that\ntwo endotrivial modules M, N \u2208 mod(kG) are equivalent if and only if M and N\nare isomorphic in stmod(kG). Let T (G) denote the set of equivalence classes of\nendotrivial kG-modules, and write [M ] for the element in T (G) that is the class of\nan endotrivial module M . Hence, if M and N are endotrivial, then [M ] = [N ] if\nand only if there exist projective kG-modules P and Q such that M \u2295 P \u223c= N \u2295Q.\nThis is equivalent to the statement that M\u2217 \u2297 N \u223c= k \u2295 (proj). Furthermore, the\ntensor product induces an abelian group structure on T (G):\n[M ] + [N ] = [M \u2297N ].\nSome results of this section, such as the finite generation of T (G), have been\nknown for many years and, likely, by several people (cf. [Be1, p. 132]).\nThe term \u201cendotrivial\u201d was coined by Dade [Da], though he originally meant it\nonly to apply to modules over p-groups. The classification of endotrivial modules\nover p-groups can be expressed roughly as follows [Da, A, CaTh2, CaTh3].\nTheorem 2.2. Suppose that G is a p-group.\n(a) The group T (G) is finitely generated and hence\nT (G) = TT (G)\u2295 TF (G)\nwhere TT (G) is the torsion subgroup and TF (G) is a torsion-free subgroup.\n(b) If G is abelian then T (G) is cyclic and is generated by the class [\u2126(k)].\n(c) TT (G) = {0} except in the cases that G is cyclic of order at least 3, quater-\nnion or semi-dihedral. In all cases TT (G) is a finite abelian 2-group.\n(d) Let n be the number of conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian\nsubgroups of p-rank 2 in G. Then, the rank of the group TF (G) is\nRank(TF (G)) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3 n if the p-rank of G is 2n+ 1 if the p-rank of G is at least 30 otherwise.\nIf G is cyclic, then T (G) is cyclic of order 1 or 2. For G quaternion, T (G) \u223c=\nZ\/4Z \u2295 Z\/2Z while if G is semi-dihedral, TT (G) \u223c= Z\/2Z (cf. [CaTh1]). A set of\ngenerators for a torsion-free subgroup of T (G) of maximal rank was constructed by\nAlperin in [A] using relative syzygies corresponding to noncentral subgroups that\nare contained in maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank 2. In [CaTh3] it\nwas first shown that these elements generate all of TF (G) and not just a subgroup\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 5\nof finite index. For the purposes of this paper, it is much more convenient to use the\nconstruction of the generators in [Ca2]. That is, the homological methods seem to\nbe more easily generalized to non-p-groups. A thorough discussion of the generators\nof TF (G) is in the next section.\nSome of the following results will be more relevant to us later, for the classification\nin the case of the finite groups of Lie type. Note that the next proposition does not\nassume that G is a p-group.\nProposition 2.3. Let G be any finite group.\n(a) Suppose that E and F are elementary abelian p-subgroups of G such that\nboth E and F have p-rank at least three. Let M be an endotrivial kG-module\nand suppose that there exist integers a and b such that\nResG,E(M) \u223c= \u2126a(kE)\u2295 (proj) and ResG,F (M) \u223c= \u2126b(kF )\u2295 (proj) .\nThen a = b (cf. [A, Thm. 4]).\n(b) A kG-module is endotrivial if and only if its restriction to every elementary\nabelian p-subgroup is endotrivial (cf. [CaTh1]).\n(c) Let E denote the set of all elementary abelian p-subgroups of G that have\np-rank at least 2. Then the product of the restriction maps\u220f\nE\u2208E\nResG,E : T (G)\u2192\n\u220f\nE\u2208E\nT (E)\nhas the properties that its kernel is the torsion subgroup TT (G) while its\nimage is isomorphic to TF (G).\nProof. The proofs of the first two statements follow from the given references. Only\nthe third statement needs some explanation. We should first note that part (c) is\ntrue if G is a p-group by the classification. In particular, the image of the map\u220f\nE\u2208E ResG,E is a torsion-free group. So suppose that M is an indecomposable\nendotrivial module such that [M ] is in the kernel of the product of the restriction\nmaps. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Then MP \u223c= L \u2295 (proj) where L is\nan indecomposable endotrivial kP -module. Moreover M is a direct summand of\nIndGP (L). The result is proved by noting that up to isomorphism, there are only\nfinitely many indecomposable endotrivial kP -modules like L, whose restrictions to\nevery elementary abelian subgroup of p-rank at least 2 are trivial. In addition, the\ninduced module IndGP (L), has only a finite number of direct summands. So the\nkernel of the product of the restrictions is a finite group. \u00a4\nRemark 2.4. In what follows we often identify TF (G) with its image under the\nproduct of the restriction maps as in statement (c) of the previous proposition. We\nsee in the next section that the image can be made more specific by choosing a\nminimal collection of elementary abelian p-subgroups such that the restrictions to\nthose subgroups detect TF (G).\nCorollary 2.5. The group T (G) is finitely generated.\nProof. By Proposition 2.3 the torsion-free subgroup TF (G) of T (G) is isomorphic\nto the image of the restriction maps to the elementary abelian p-subgroups of G of\n6 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\np-rank at least 2. There is only a finite number of such maps, and hence TF (G) is\nfinitely generated. A proof that TT (G) is finite is part of the proof of part (c) of\nthe proposition. \u00a4\nThe reader should keep in mind that the restriction to any subgroup of an en-\ndotrivial module is an endotrivial module. Hence the restriction map induces a\nhomomorphism on groups of endotrivial modules. Moreover, if E is an elementary\nabelian p-group then any endotrivial kE-module has the form \u2126a(k) \u2295 (proj) for\nsome integer a.\nIn this paper we concentrate on the study of endotrivial modules over finite groups\nthat are not p-groups. For this we need the following.\nProposition 2.6. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G, and let H = NG(P ), the\nnormalizer of P in G. Then we have the following.\n(a) The restriction map ResG,H : T (G)\u2192 T (H) is injective.\n(b) If M is an endotrivial kG-module, then M is a direct summand of IndGP (N)\nfor some endotrivial kP -module N .\n(c) Suppose that M is a kG-module whose restriction to P is an endotrivial\nmodule. Then M is an endotrivial module.\n(d) In the case that G = H (i.e. that P is normal in G), an indecomposable\nkG-module M is endotrivial if and only if its restriction to P is an indecom-\nposable endotrivial module.\nProof. For part (a), we observe that ifM is an endotrivial module, thenMH \u223c= N\u2295Q\nwhere N is the Green correspondent of M . Also, the dimension of M is relatively\nprime to p, since p does not divide the dimension of M\u2217 \u2297M . So M and hence\nN have vertex P . Since MH is an endotrivial module, Q is a projective module.\nHowever, because N is the Green correspondent, it is uniquely defined by M . So\nthe restriction map is injective.\nPart (b) is an application of the theory of vertices and sources. In particular, M\nis a direct summand of IndGP (MP ). Since MP is endotrivial, we are done.\nFor statement (c), let U denote the kernel of the trace map Homk(M,M) \u2192 k.\nThen we have an exact sequence\n0\u2192 U \u2192 Homk(M,M)\u2192 k \u2192 0.\nWe know thatMP is an endotrivial module. Hence, on restriction to P , the sequence\nsplits and UP is a projective module (actually, the sequence splits only because the\ndimension ofM is relatively prime to p). This implies that U is a projective module,\nand Homk(M,M) \u223c= k \u2295 U . So M is endotrivial.\n(d) Let M be an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module. Suppose that MP \u223c=\nN1 \u2295 N2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Nt where each Ni is indecomposable, and N1 is a source for M .\nThen M is a direct summand of the induced module IndGP (N1). On the other hand,\nbecause P is normal in G, the restriction of IndGP (N1) to P is direct sum of G-\nconjugates of N1. That is, every Ni must be a G-conjugate of N1. Now MP is a\nsum of an indecomposable endotrivial module and a projective. The only way that\nthis can happen is if MP is indecomposable. This proves one half of part (d). The\nconverse follows from statement (c). \u00a4\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 7\nCorollary 2.7. Suppose that the Sylow p-subgroup P of G is normal in G and that\nG\/P is abelian. If P is not cyclic, quaternion or semi-dihedral, then TT (G) is\nisomorphic to the character group of G\/P .\nProof. If M is an endotrivial kG-module such that [M ] is in TT (G), then MP is\nisomorphic to k \u2295 (proj), by Theorem 2.2(c). However, this means that [M ] = [N ]\nfor N some indecomposable summand of IndGP (k). Because G\/P is abelian, Ind\nG\nP (k)\nis a direct sum of all of the irreducible kG modules, which have dimension one.\nTherefore, N affords a one-dimensional character of G. \u00a4\nWe end this section with a characterization of T (G) in a special case.\nProposition 2.8. Suppose that the Sylow p-subgroup P of G is a trivial intersection\nsubgroup. Then the restriction map induces an isomorphism T (G) \u223c= T (NG(P )).\nProof. Set H = NG(P ). Recall that P is a trivial intersection subgroup of G means\nthat if x \u2208 G and x \/\u2208 H then P \u2229 xPx\u22121 = {1}. Suppose that N is an endotrivial\nkH-module. Then the Mackey formula implies that\nResG,H Ind\nG\nH(N)\n\u223c=\n\u2295\nHxH\nIndHH\u2229xHx\u22121 ResH,H\u2229xHx\u22121(x\u2297N) \u223c= N \u2295 (proj),\nwhere the sum is over a set of representatives of the H-H double cosets in G. The\npoint is that if x \/\u2208 H, then H \u2229 xHx\u22121 is a p\u2032-subgroup and any module induced\nfrom such a subgroup is projective. It follows that IndGH(N) is an endotrivial module.\nOn the other hand, suppose thatM is an indecomposable endotrivial kG-module.\nThen its Green correspondent N is an endotrivial kH-module and M is a direct\nsummand of IndGH(N). Consequently, restriction and induction induce inverse ho-\nmomorphisms between T (G) and T (H). \u00a4\nRemark 2.9. Proposition 2.8 holds in a more general case. Indeed, the claim still\nholds when the normalizer of the Sylow p-subgroup is a strongly p-embedded sub-\ngroup. However, we emphasize the statement of the result for a trivial intersection\nSylow p-subgroup, since we need it thereafter.\nRemark 2.10. Note that in general, the Green correspondent M of an endotrivial\nkH-module N is not an endotrivial kG-module. However, its restriction MP to P\nis an endo-permutation module that belongs to the class of an endotrivial module\n(namely NP ).\nThe methods of the proof actually show that the stable categories stmod(kG)\nand stmod(kH) are equivalent and the equivalence is induced by the restriction\nand induction maps. Of course, the equivalence induces an isomorphism of groups\nof endotrivial modules.\n3. The torsion-free rank of T (G)\nAlperin [A] determined the rank of TF (G) in the case that G is a finite p-group.\nOur purpose here is to show, using homological methods, that the same theorem\nholds for any finite group.\n8 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nNote that Proposition 2.3 proves that if the p-rank of G is one, then TF (G) = {0}.\nSo, in this section, we will assume that the p-rank of G is at least 2. The methods\nthat we employ follow those in [Ca2]. We record the details here for the sake of\ncompleteness. In the case that the Sylow p-subgroup of G is normal, we can also\nspecify the generators of TF (G), by a result of [Ca2].\nFor notation, let C be the collection of all maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups\nof G. Then we write\nC = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Cn\nwhere we have one of the following\n(i) If the p-rank of G is two, then C1, . . . , Cn are the conjugacy classes of maximal\nelementary abelian p-subgroups of G, all of which are of order p2.\n(ii) If the p-rank of G is greater than two, then the sets C1, . . . , Cn\u22121 are the\nconjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank two,\nand Cn is the collection of all maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of\np-rank larger than two.\nNote that if there are no maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank two\nin G, then n = 1 and C = C1. For each i, choose a maximal elementary abelian\np-subgroup Ei \u2208 Ci.\nTheorem 3.1. Assume that the p-rank of G is at least 2. Then the torsion-free\nrank of the group T (G) is the number n.\nProof. Recall that if E is an elementary abelian p-subgroup of order pe for e > 1 then\nT (E) \u223c= Z, where the class of an endotrivial module M corresponds to the number\naE(M) = a such that ME \u223c= \u2126a(k)\u2295 (proj). We know that if aE(M) = 0 for all E,\nthen the class of M is a torsion element in T (G). Moreover, if E and F both have\np-rank at least three, then aE(M) = aF (M) (cf. Proposition 2.3). Consequently,\na torsion-free subgroup of T (G) of maximal rank is isomorphic to the image of the\nmap\n\u03a8 =\nn\u220f\ni=1\nResG,Ei : T (G)\u2192\nn\u220f\ni=1\nT (Ei) ,\nwhere for each i, we choose Ei \u2208 Ci as above. In particular, the torsion-free rank\nof T (G) is at most n. If n = 1, then there is nothing more to prove. So for the\nremainder of the proof assume that n > 1.\nBy Quillen\u2019s Dimension Theorem (cf. [Be2, Thm. 5.1.1]), we know that\nVG(k) =\n\u22c3\nE\u2208C\nRes\u2217G,E(VE(k)),\nwhere Res\u2217G,E : VE(k) \u2212\u2192 VG(k) is the restriction map induced on the varieties by\nthe inclusion of E in G. If E and F are conjugate then Res\u2217G,E(VE(k)) is the same as\nRes\u2217G,F (VF (k)). If E \u2208 C has p-rank two, then VE(k) is a plane, and the intersection\nof Res\u2217G,E(VE(k)) with Res\n\u2217\nG,F (VF (k)), for F not conjugate to E, is a subvarietyW of\ndimension one. In fact, the intersection W is precisely the subvariety Res\u2217G,Z(VZ(k))\nwhere Z is a subgroup of order p in the center of some Sylow p-subgroup of G. It\nfollows that for some m > 0 there exists an element \u03b6 \u2208 Hm(G, k) with the property\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 9\nthat VG(\u03b6), the set of all maximal ideals containing \u03b6, intersects W transversely.\nIt is sufficient here to choose the element \u03b6 so that ResG,Z(\u03b6) is not nilpotent, or\nequivalently, so that ResG,Z(\u03b6) 6= 0 and that m is even if p > 2. Assume that such\nan element has been chosen.\nLet \u03b6 \u2032 : \u2126m(k) \u2192 k be a cocycle that represents \u03b6. The kernel of \u03b6 \u2032, L\u03b6 , is a\nmodule having support variety VG(L\u03b6) = VG(\u03b6) (cf. [Be2, Prop. 5.9.1]). Then, the\nsupport variety is disconnected. That is, we have that\nVG(L\u03b6) = V1 \u222a V2 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Vn\nwhere\nVi =\n\u22c3\nE\u2208Ci\nRes\u2217G,E(VE(L\u03b6)).\nNotice here that when i < n and in any case that Ci is the conjugacy class of a single\nmaximal elementary abelian group of rank 2, we have that Vi = Res\n\u2217\nG,Ei\n(VEi(L\u03b6)) =\nRes\u2217G,Ei(VEi(ResG,Ei(\u03b6))) for some element Ei in Ci. Moreover, because VG(L\u03b6) is\ntransverse to W , it is necessary that Vi \u2229 Vj = {0}, for i 6= j. Consequently, L\u03b6\ndecomposes as\nL\u03b6 = L1 \u2295 L2 \u2295 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2295 Ln\nwhere VG(Li) = Vi (cf. [Be2, Thm. 5.12.1]).\nFor any i < n, let V \u2032i = \u222aj 6=iVj and let L\u2032i = \u2295j 6=iLj. Then we have a diagram\n0\n\u00b2\u00b2\n0\n\u00b2\u00b2\nL\u2032i\n\u00b2\u00b2\nL\u2032i\n\u00b2\u00b2\n0 \/\/ L\u03b6 \/\/\n\u00b2\u00b2\n\u2126m(k)\n\u03b6\u2032 \/\/\n\u00b2\u00b2\nk \/\/ 0\n0 \/\/ Li \/\/\n\u00b2\u00b2\nNi \/\/\n\u00b2\u00b2\nk \/\/ 0\n0 0\nwhere Ni is the pushout.\nWe claim that Ni is an endotrivial module. To prove the claim it is only necessary\nto show that the restriction of Ni to any maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup\nE of G is an endotrivial module. Suppose that E is in Ci. Then because V \u2032i , which\nis the support variety of L\u2032i, intersects Res\n\u2217\nG,E(VE(k)) in the set {0} we conclude\nthat ResG,E(L\n\u2032\ni) is a projective kE-module. Hence on restriction to the subgroup E,\nthe middle column splits, and ResG,E Ni \u223c= \u2126m(k)\u2295 (proj). Thus, ResG,E(Ni) is an\nendotrivial module. On the other hand, suppose that E \u2208 Cj for j 6= i. Then by a\nsimilar argument, Li is projective on restriction to E. So this time the bottom row\nin the diagram splits on restriction to E, and we have that ResG,E Ni \u223c= k \u2295 (proj).\n10 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nHence, we have constructed a collection N1, . . . , Nn\u22121 of endotrivial modules.\nMoreover, we know the restriction of any Ni to any maximal elementary abelian\np-subgroup of G. Therefore, considering the map \u03a8 defined at the beginning of\nthe proof, we have that the classes of the modules \u2126(k), N1, . . . , Nn\u22121 generate a\ntorsion-free subgroup of T (G) that has rank n. This proves the theorem. \u00a4\nTheorem 3.1 leads us directly to the following observations.\nCorollary 3.2. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G and let H = NG(P ).\n(a) If P is a dihedral group of order 8, the torsion-free ranks of T (G) and T (H)\nequal 2.\n(b) If H controls the p-fusion in G, then the image of the restriction map ResG,H\nis a subgroup of TF (H) of finite index.\nProof. (a) In this case, P has 2 maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank 2,\nand they are never conjugate inside any finite group having P as a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n(b) If H controls the p-fusion, then the H- and G-conjugacy classes of subgroups\nof P are the same, and so T (G) and T (H) have the same torsion-free rank. Thus,\nthe assertion follows, since the restriction map ResG,H is an injective group homo-\nmorphism. \u00a4\nWe end this section with some notes on the generators of TF (G). If the group G\nis a p-group, then there is a well defined formula for the generators [Ca2, CaTh3].\nThe generators can be constructed by carving up the syzygies of the trivial module\nor by taking relative syzygies as in [A]. Furthermore, the methods of [Ca2] can be\nextended to the case that G is a finite group that has a normal Sylow p-subgroup.\nTo state the theorem we need some additional notation. Assume that G has a\nnormal Sylow p-subgroup P . We assume also that the rank of TF (G) is at least two,\nbecause otherwise, we know that TF (G) is generated by \u2126(k). This means that the\nnumber n of conjugacy classes of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of G is\nat least 2. It follows also from the last assumption that P has a cyclic center and a\nunique central subgroup Z = \u3008z\u3009 of order p. Note that Z is also normal in G. Let\nP = P\/Z and G = G\/Z. For any kG-module M let M =M\/M0 where\nM0 = {m \u2208M | (z \u2212 1)p\u22121m = 0}.\nNotice that M is a kG-module.\nThe following is a rephrasing of [Ca2, Thm. 4.2, Cor. 4.3] in the special case that\nM \u223c= \u2126m(k). The proof of the theorem is even more technical than its statement. It\nultimately relies on a theorem of the first author and Benson on the partial inflations\nof cohomology of the quotient group G onto the pages of the Lyndon-Hochschild-\nSerre spectral sequence of the group extension. Cf. [Ca2] for details.\nTheorem 3.3. Suppose that for some m, VG(\u2126\nm(k)) = V1\u222aV2, where V1\u2229V2 = {0}.\nAssume further that for any elementary abelian p-subgroup E of G, we have that\nRes\u2217\nG,E\n(VE(k)) \u2286 Vi for either i = 1 or for i = 2. Then there exists an endotrivial\nkG-module U with the property that one of the following happens.\n(i) If Res\u2217\nG,E\n(VE(k)) \u2286 V1, then UE \u223c= \u2126m(kE)\u2295 (proj).\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 11\n(ii) If Res\u2217\nG,E\n(VE(k)) \u2286 V2, then UE \u223c= k \u2295 (proj).\nTo state the theorem on generators we first introduce the following notation. For\ni = 1, . . . , n\u2212 1, let ai be defined by the following rule.\n(a) If p > 2, then let ai = 2p.\n(b) If p = 2, then let ai = |F |\/2 where F is an elementary abelian p-subgroup\nof P which has maximal order subject to the condition that Ei \u2286 F .\nTheorem 3.4. Suppose that G has a normal Sylow p-subgroup. For any i =\n1, . . . n\u2212 1 there is an endotrivial module Ni such that\n(Ni)Ei = \u2126\nai(k)\u2295 (proj) and (Ni)Ej \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) for j 6= i.\nThe classes [\u2126(k)] and [Ni] for i = 1, . . . , n\u22121 are a free set of generators for TF (G).\nIn particular, the restriction map induces an isomorphism TF (G) \u223c= TF (P )G\/P ,\nwhere TF (P )G\/P denotes the G\/P -fixed points of TF (P ), for the action of G\/P\ninduced by the conjugacy on the subgroups of P .\nProof. We know that the theorem is true in the case that G = P by [Ca2, Thm.\n7.2]. We fix i such that 1 \u2264 i < n and let a = ai. Recall that Ci is the G-conjugacy\nclass of Ei. We write Ci = U1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222a Ur where each Uj is a P -conjugacy class of\nmaximal elementary abelian subgroups of p-rank 2. The argument in the proof of\n[Ca2, Thm. 7.2] shows that for each j, VP (\u2126\na(k)) = Wj \u222aW \u2032j where Wj \u2229W \u2032j = {0},\nand also for any elementary abelian p-subgroup E of P , Res\u2217\nP ,E\n(VE(k)) \u2286 Wj if and\nonly if E \u2208 Uj.\nThe implication is that VG(\u2126\na(k)) = Res\u2217\nG,P\n(VP (\u2126\na(k))) = Vi \u222a V \u2032i where Vi =\n\u222aj Res\u2217G,P (Wj). That is, we have that\nVP (\u2126\na(k)) = (W1 \u222a \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u222aWr) \u222a W\u02c6\nwhere W\u02c6 = \u2229jW \u2032j . The group G\/P acts on the variety VP (\u2126a(k)) by permuting\nthe components W1, . . . ,Wr since they correspond to conjugate subgroups. The\nsubvariety W\u02c6 is fixed (setwise) by the action of G\/P . The variety VG(\u2126\na(k)) is the\norbit space of this action. Now Theorem 3.3 guarantees that there is a module Ni,\nwhich satisfies\n(Ni)Ei = \u2126\nai(k)\u2295 (proj) and (Ni)Ej \u223c= k \u2295 (proj) for j 6= i.\nLet T be the subgroup of TF (G) generated by the classes [\u2126(k)] and [N1], . . . , [Nn\u22121].\nBy [Ca2, Thm. 7.2], the restriction map ResG,P takes T surjectively onto TF (P )G\/P .\nThat is, the generators for TF (P )G\/P are the orbit sums of the action of G\/P on\nTF (P ). On the other hand, the restriction from TF (G) to TF (P ) is injective, by\nProposition 2.3(c). It follows that the restriction map is an isomorphism on the\ntorsion-free subgroups and that T \u223c= TF (G) as asserted. \u00a4\n4. Finite groups of Lie type. Generalities\nFor the remainder of the paper, we will consider the following setting. Let G\u0302 be a\nconnected semisimple algebraic group (of adjoint type), defined over an algebraically\nclosed field k of characteristic p > 0. Fix a maximal torus T\u0302 and let \u03a6 be the root\n12 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nsystem associated to (G\u0302, T\u0302 ). The positive (resp. negative) roots are \u03a6+ (resp. \u03a6\u2212),\nand \u2206 is a base consisting of simple roots. Let h denote the Coxeter number of\nthe root system \u03a6. Let B\u0302 be a Borel subgroup containing T\u0302 corresponding to the\npositive roots, and let U\u0302 be the unipotent radical of B\u0302. Note that B\u0302 = T\u0302 n U\u0302 and\nB\u0302 = N bG(U\u0302) = N bG(B\u0302). For a given root system \u03a6 of Lie rank n, the simple roots will\nbe denoted by \u03b11, \u03b12, . . . , \u03b1n. We will adhere to the ordering of the simple roots as\ngiven in [BMP] (following Dynkin). For each root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ write U\u0302\u03b1 = \u3008x\u03b1(t) | t \u2208 k\u3009\nfor the corresponding root subgroup. Then U\u0302 =\n\u220f\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6+ U\u0302\u03b1. Any root \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+ can\nbe uniquely written as a linear combination\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206 n\u03b1\u03b1, for non-negative integers\nn\u03b1. Define the height h(\u03b2) of \u03b2 to be the positive integer\n\u2211\n\u03b1\u2208\u2206 n\u03b1.\nConsider a Steinberg endomorphism \u03c3 : G\u0302 \u2212\u2192 G\u0302. That is, \u03c3 is an endomorphism\nof algebraic groups whose subgroup of fixed points G\u0302\u03c3 is finite. The finite groups\nG\u0302\u03c3 are the finite groups of Lie type, and they are defined over a finite field of\ncharacteristic p. They have been classified as follows (cf. [GLS, 2.2.3]). Namely, we\ndistinguish three kinds of finite groups, according to the type of \u03c3:\n(i) If \u03c3 is induced by the Frobenius map on Fq, for a positive power q = pa of\np, then \u03c3(x\u03b1(t)) = x\u03b1(t\nq), \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+. The resulting finite groups are the\nChevalley groups, or untwisted groups, usually denoted by the corresponding\nroot system: An(q), n \u2265 1, Bn(q), Cn(q), n \u2265 2 and Dn(q), n \u2265 4 are called\nclassical, and E6(q), E7(q), E8(q), F4(q) and G2(q) are called exceptional.\n(ii) If all the roots have the same length and if \u03c3 involves a non trivial isometry\n\u03c4 of order d of the underlying Dynkin diagram, as well as the Frobenius\nmap on Fqd , then we get the twisted groups of Lie type (or Steinberg groups).\nThey are usually denoted by 2An(q),\n2Dn(q),\n3D4(q) and\n2E6(q), where the\nsuperscript indicates the order d of \u03c4 . They are defined over the field Fqd .\n(iii) Suppose that \u03a6 is of type B2 (resp. F4, G2) with p = 2 (resp. 2, 3), and\nthat \u03c3 involves the Frobenius map on Fq2 and a non trivial permutation of\nthe roots. These groups are defined over a finite field Fq, where q is an odd\npower of p. Hence, the resulting groups are the Suzuki groups 2B2(2\na+ 1\n2 ),\nand the Ree groups 2F4(2\na+ 1\n2 ) and 2G2(3\na+ 1\n2 ), defined respectively on the\nfields F22a+1 , F22a+1 and F32a+1 , for a non negative integer a.\nFor our purposes, the reference material and the notation concerning these groups\ncan be found in [GLS].\nLet us denote by G = G\u0302\u03c3 one of these finite groups and the subgroups obtained\nfrom B\u0302, T\u0302 and U\u0302 , by B, T and U respectively. Write also X(T ) for the character\ngroup of T .\nThe isometry \u03c4 induces a map from \u03a6 to the twisted root system \u03a6\u02dc of G, defined as\nfollows. Let V be the Euclidian space spanned by \u03a6 and let V\u02dc = {v \u2208 V | \u03c4(v) = v}\nbe the set of fixed points. Then, \u03a6\u02dc consists of the projections of the roots of \u03a6 onto\nV\u02dc , and the map induced by \u03c4 sends a root \u03b1 on its projection \u03b1\u02dc in V\u02dc .\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 13\nFurthermore, we can define an equivalence relation on \u03a6\u02dc by identifying positive\ncolinear roots. Let \u03a6\u0302 = {\u03b1\u0302 | \u03b1\u02dc \u2208 \u03a6\u02dc} be the set of equivalence classes, where\n\u03b1\u0302 = {\u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6 | \u2203 c > 0 : \u03b1\u02dc = c\u03b2\u02dc} .\nSo we have mappings \u03a6\u2192 \u03a6\u02dc\u2192 \u03a6\u0302. Let \u2206\u0302 be the image of \u2206 under this composition\nof maps and \u2206\u02dc be the image of \u2206 under \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6\u02dc. The root subgroups of G are\nindexed by the elements of \u03a6\u0302. In particular, if G is untwisted then \u03a6 = \u03a6\u02dc = \u03a6\u0302. In\ncase G is a Steinberg but not 2A2m(q) we have \u03a6\u02dc = \u03a6\u0302. We refer the reader to [GLS,\n\u00a72.3] for more details.\n5. The case |\u2206\u0302| = 1\nThe finite groups of Lie type for which |\u2206\u0302| = 1 are A1(q), 2A2(q), 2B2(2a+ 12 ),\nand 2G2(3\na+ 1\n2 ), according to the notation introduced above. Let us first point out\na general fact concerning these groups.\nLemma 5.1. Let G be such that |\u2206\u0302| = 1. Then the Sylow p-subgroups of G are TI\nsubgroups.\nProof. By [GLS, Thm. 2.3.5], the Bruhat Decomposition holds in G. That is, for\nany w \u2208 N\/T and for any g \u2208 G, there exist unique u \u2208 U, n \u2208 N and v \u2208 U \u2229Uw0w\nsuch that g = unv, and the canonical projection N \u2212\u2192 N\/T maps n onto w. Here,\nN = NG(T ), and w0 \u2208 N\/T is the unique element of N\/T satisfying U \u2229Uw0 = {1}.\nNow, if G is such that |\u2206\u0302| = 1, then N\/T = \u3008w0\u3009 \u223c= Z\/2Z. Hence, if g \u2208 G, and\ng = unv is its Bruhat Decomposition, then we have\ngU \u2229 U = u( wU \u2229 U) =\n{ {1} if w = w0 \u21d0\u21d2 n 6\u2208 B\nU if w = 1 \u21d0\u21d2 n \u2208 B\nThat is U is a TI subgroup of G. \u00a4\nProposition 5.2. Suppose that G is isomorphic to one of A1(q),\n2A2(q),\n2B2(2\na+ 1\n2 ),\nor 2G2(3\na+ 1\n2 ).\n(a) If G \u223c= A1(2), then TT (U) = T (U) = {0}\n(b) If G \u223c= A1(p), and p > 2, or if G \u223c= 2B2(2 12 ), then TT (U) = T (U) \u223c= Z\/2Z.\n(c) If G \u223c= 2A2(2), then TT (U) = T (U) \u223c= Z\/2Z\u2295 Z\/4Z.\n(d) In the other cases, we have TT (U) = {0}.\nMoreover, for each group, the restriction map induces an isomorphism of T (G)\nto T (B).\nProof. (a), (b) If G \u223c= A1(p), then U is cyclic of order p and \u21262(k) \u223c= k, whereas\n\u21261(k) is trivial if and only if p = 2 (cf. [Da]). If G \u223c= 2B2(2 12 ), then we used a\ncomputer calculation to check that the Sylow 2-subgroup is cyclic of order 4.\n(c) If G \u223c= 2A2(2) then U is a quaternion group of order 8, and so we conclude\n(cf. [CaTh1, Thm. 6.3]) that TT (U) = T (U) \u223c= Z\/2Z\u2295 Z\/4Z (since F4 has a cubic\nroot of unity).\n(d) In all the other cases, U is neither cyclic, nor quaternion, and so TT (U) = {0},\nby the classification of endotrivial modules for finite p-groups.\n14 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nThe final statement is a consequence of Proposition 2.8 and Lemma 5.1, since in\nall the cases we consider, we have |\u2206\u0302| = 1. \u00a4\nIn particular, if G \u223c= A1(q), then U is abelian and so T (U) is cyclic, generated by\nthe class of \u2126(k), and B controls the p-fusion in G.\nCorollary 5.3. Let G \u223c= A1(q).\n(a) If q = 2, then U = B, and T (U), T (B), and T (G) are all trivial.\n(b) If q = p > 2, then T (G) \u223c= T (B) \u223c= Z\/(p \u2212 1)Z is generated by the class of\nthe syzygy \u2126(k).\n(c) In all the other cases, T (G) \u223c= T (B) \u223c= T (U)\u2295X(T ), and T (U) \u223c= Z.\nProof. Write \u2126H(k) for the syzygy of the trivial kH-module for a finite group H, and\n[\u2126H(k)] for its class in T (H). Consider the restriction maps ResG,U : T (G)\u2192 T (U)\nand ResB,U : T (B) \u2192 T (U). Since U is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and B, we have\nResG,U([\u2126G(k)]) = [\u2126U(k)], and ResB,U([\u2126B(k)]) = [\u2126U(k)]. This implies that if\nT (U) = \u3008[\u2126U(k)]\u3009 then both restriction maps are surjective, and so statements (a)\nand (c) follow from Corollary 3.2 and Proposition 5.2. In the case (b), the group G\nis PSL(2, p), and the Borel group B consists of cosets modulo the center of upper\ntriangular matrices of determinant one (elements of SL(2, p)). The group X(T ) has\norder (p\u2212 1)\/2. The group B is generated by two elements x and y of order p and\n(p\u22121)\/2. Here x is represented in SL(2, p) by a nonidentity upper triangular matrix\nwith ones on the diagonal and y is represented by a diagonal matrix with entries\na and a\u22121 where a is a generator for the multiplicative group of nonzero elements\nin the prime field Fp. Thus we have the relation that yxy\u22121 = xa\n2\nIt can be easily\nseen that the projective cover P of the trivial kB-module is uniserial with successive\nradical quotients Radi P\/(Radi+1 P ) = Mi, such that Mi has dimension one and y\nacts on Mi by multiplication by a\n2i. Then a straightforward computation of the\nprojective resolution of k shows that \u21262(k) \u223c= M1 is a generator for X(T ). \u00a4\nLet us now consider the other groups for which |\u2206\u0302| = 1. In these cases, Propo-\nsition 5.2 answers the question regarding T (U) and the torsion subgroups of the\ngroups of endotrivial modules for B and G.\nWe handle now these groups case by case and we determine the torsion-free ranks\nof T (G), T (B) and T (U). As mentioned previously, whenever TF (G) is not cyclic,\nthen our results allow us only to recover the torsion-free rank of T (G), but we do\nnot get a set of generators, except in the case where G has type 2A2(2), since the\ngroup is 2-nilpotent. For T (B) and T (U), a minimal set of generators for TF (B)\nand TF (U) can be computed using Theorem 3.4.\nFor brevity, for the remainder of the paper, we will write G = dXn(q) instead of\n\u201ca finite group G of Lie type dXn(q)\u201d, where X \u2208 {A, B, C, D, E, F, G} and\nd = 1, 2, or 3.\nG = 2A2(q) : In this case, according to [GLS, Table 2.4, p.46], the group G\nis defined over Fp2 and a Sylow p-subgroup of 2A2(p) is an extraspecial p-group.\nNamely, it is a quaternion group of order 8, if p = 2, and it is an extraspecial p-group\nof order p3 and exponent p otherwise.\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 15\nLet us consider first the case p > 2. We present the structure of U and its\nnormalizer B in some detail, as they are found in [C1, \u00a713.7] (cf. pages 239-243).\nWe may assume that the center of U is generated by\nz =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed1 0 00 1 0\nu 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 where u \u2208 Fp2 satisfies u+ up = 0.\nThen z has order p.\nLet t be a generator of F\u2217p2 . Then, the set {ti | 1 \u2264 i \u2264 p + 1} is a set of\ncosets representatives for F\u2217p in F\u2217p2 . Moreover, there are p + 1 elementary abelian\np-subgroups of p-rank 2 given by Ei = \u3008xi , z\u3009, where\nxi =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed1 0 0ti 1 0\nbi t\nip 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 with bi + bpi = ti(p+1) .\nAlso, the group T \u223c= B\/U is generated by\n\u03c4 =\n\uf8eb\uf8edt\u2212p 0 00 tp\u22121 0\n0 0 t\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 \u2208 T,\nA straightforward computation gives us\n\u03c4xi =\n\uf8eb\uf8ed 1 0 0ti+2p\u22121 1 0\nt(p+1)bi t\nip+2\u2212p 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f8 \u2208 Ei+2p\u22121 ,\nwhere the index i+ 2p\u2212 1 is taken modulo p+ 1. Therefore,\n{ \u03c4 jE1 | 0 \u2264 j \u2264 p\u2212 1} = {Ei | i = 1, . . . p\u2212 1} \u21d0\u21d2 2p\u2212 1 6\u2261 0 mod (p+ 1) .\nThat is, all the Ei\u2019s are conjugate in B if and only if 3 does not divide p+1. If this\nis the case, then we have a unique conjugacy class of maximal elementary abelian p-\nsubgroups of p-rank 2. Otherwise, we have 3 classes of such subgroups (cf. also [Hu,\nSatz II.10.12]). Consequently, we have the following.\nTheorem 5.4. Suppose that G = 2A2(p) for p \u2265 3. The torsion-free ranks of\nT (U), T (B) and T (G) are given in the table\nT (U) T (B) T (G)\np+ 1 \u2261 0 mod 3 p+ 1 3 3\np+ 1 6\u2261 0 mod 3 p+ 1 1 1\nConsider now the case p = 2. Then, G = 2A2(2) is defined over F4 and it is a\n2-nilpotent group of order 72 (cf. [GLS, Thm. 2.2.7], or also [Hu, Satz II.10.14]).\nHence T (G) and T (B) are isomorphic, since their module categories mod(kG) and\nmod(kB) are equivalent. We conclude then that the restriction maps induce iso-\nmorphisms between T (G) and T (B) and both are isomorphic to T (U) \u2295 X(T ),\nwhere T (U) = TT (U) \u223c= Z\/2Z\u2295 Z\/4Z, since F4 contains a cubed root of unity (cf.\nProposition 5.2).\n16 JON F.

These groups are very specific and a computer\ncalculation has been used to check that there are no maximal elementary abelian\np-subgroups of p-rank 2. In case a = 0, as mentioned previously, the Sylow 2-\nsubgroup is cyclic of order 4. For larger values of a the maximal elementary abelian\n2-subgroups all have 2-rank at least 3.

As with the Suzuki groups, the Ree groups are\nvery specific, and so a computer calculation was used to determine whether there\nare maximal elementary abelian 3-subgroups of order 9 in G.\nIf a = 0, then a Sylow 3-subgroup has order 27 and is extraspecial with exponent 9.\nIt has a unique elementary abelian 3-subgroup of order 9 which is normal. For\na > 0, there are no maximal elementary abelian 3-subgroups of order less than 27.\nConsequently we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.6. Suppose that G = 2G2(3\na+ 1\n2 ). Then T (G) \u223c= T (B) \u223c= T (U)\u2295X(T )\nand T (U) \u223c= Z is generated by the class of \u2126(k).\n6. The case |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2 : Torsion subgroups\nIn this section we consider the torsion groups TT (G), TT (B), and TT (U) for\nG = G\u0302(q), q = pa when |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2. First we should recall that because U is a p-group\nwe know TT (U) from Theorem 2.2. In particular, TT (U) = {0} except in the case\nthat U is cyclic, quaternion or semi-dihedral. This only happens when G is A1(p)\nor 2A2(2) (both cases having |\u2206\u0302| = 1). Hence we have the following.\nProposition 6.1. Suppose that |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2. Then TT (U) = {0} and TT (B) is iso-\nmorphic to the character group X(T ) of the torus T .\nThe isomorphism is a consequence of Corollary 2.7. By Proposition 2.6, the\nrestriction map from TT (G) to TT (B) is injective. Consequently, to determine\nTT (G) we need only decide which kB-modules of dimension one can have a Green\ncorrespondent which is endotrivial.\nTheorem 6.2. Suppose that |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2. Then TT (G) = {0}. In particular, the Green\ncorrespondent of a kB-module \u03bb of dimension one, is an endotrivial module if and\nonly if \u03bb \u223c= k.\nProof. LetM be the Green correspondent of \u03bb. It follows thatM is the unique inde-\ncomposable summand of IndGB \u03bb which has vertex U , and we can write ResG,B(M) =\n\u03bb\u2295 L, for some kB-module L.\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 17\nLet n = |\u2206\u0302| and choose \u03b1\u0302i \u2208 \u2206\u0302 with corresponding parabolic subgroup Pi.

Then N\nis the kPi-module which is the Green correspondent of \u03bb. Hence, N is isomorphic\nto direct summand of MPi , and N is also isomorphic to a direct summand of the\ninduced module IndPiB \u03bb.\nThe Mackey formula gives us an isomorphism of kB-modules\nResPi,B Ind\nPi\nB \u03bb\n\u223c=\n\u2295\nBwB\n(\nIndBBw\u2229B \u03bb\nw\n)\n= \u03bb\u2295 IndBBw\u2229B \u03bbw ,\nwhere the sum is over the B-B-double cosets in Pi. The last equality follows because\nthere are only two such double cosets.\nNote that w 6= w0 since Pi is a proper parabolic subgroup of G. This forces T to\nbe a proper subgroup of Bw \u2229B (containing T and the unipotent radical of Pi) and\nso we get an inequality\nDim(IndBBw\u2229B \u03bb\nw) = |B : (Bw \u2229B)| < |U |\nHence, the module ResB,U Ind\nB\nBw\u2229B \u03bb\nw has no projective summands. It follows that\nif M is an endotrivial module, then N also and this forces ResPi,B N\n\u223c= \u03bb. But the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for\n\u03bb = (\u03bb1, \u03bb2, . . . , \u03bbn) \u2208 X(T )\nto be liftable to Pi is that \u03bbi = 0 (i.e. \u03bb when restricted to the derived subgroup of\nthe Levi subgroup corresponding to Pi yields the trivial module).\nIt follows that if the Green correspondent M of \u03bb is endotrivial then \u03bbi = 0, for\nall 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, which is equivalent to saying that \u03bb = k and hence M = k. \u00a4\n7. The case |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2 : Torsion-free ranks\nThe goal of this subsection is to show that, most of the time, the group of en-\ndotrivial modules T (G) is cyclic, generated by the class of \u2126(k). This will reduce\nthe problem of determining T (G) for group of Lie type to a few special cases which\nare treated in the next section.\nAssume throughout the section that G = G\u0302(q) for q = pa defined over Fqd , where\nd is the order of the Steinberg automorphism acting on G\u0302 . Assume also that for\nG we have |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2.\nTheorem 7.1. Suppose that |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2 and q = pa where a \u2265 2.

CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nProof. The center of U has p-rank at least a. Hence if a \u2265 2 then U can not have\na maximal elementary abelian subgroup of p-rank 2. Consequently T (U) \u223c= Z by\nTheorem 2.2. The remainder follows from Corollary 2.7 and Theorem 6.2. \u00a4\nWe now consider the case when q = p (i.e. a = 1) with |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2. Our analysis\nof this case starts by investigating the elementary abelian subgroups in the Sylow\np-subgroups of the untwisted groups and the Steinberg groups which are not iso-\nmorphic to 2A2m(p). That is, we consider all the situations when \u03a6\u02dc = \u03a6\u0302. Then, we\ncan prove the following.\nLemma 7.2. Suppose that |\u2206\u02dc| \u2265 3.

The proof is by a case by case analysis using the tables of positive roots\nin [BMP]. We let the set of simple roots \u2206 = {\u03b11, . . . , \u03b1n} is ordered according\nthe Dynkin ordering (as in [BMP]).

In either case the root subgroups are elementary abelian p-groups. Let m\u03b2 be\nthe p-rank of Ub\u03b2. Assume that we have the same hypothesis and notation as in the\nabove proposition. Then we can prove the following.\nProposition 7.3. Let G be an untwisted group or a Steinberg group which is not\n2A2m(q). Let H be the subgroup of U generated by the subgroups U b\u03b2i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s\nand let u \u2208 U . Set m(j) =\u2211ji=1m\u03b2i for j = s, t. Then\n(a) H is an elementary abelian p-subgroup of order pm(s) and H is normal in U ,\n(b) |CH(u)| \u2265 pm(t), and\n(c) CU(u) has an elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank at least m(t) + 1.\nProof. Let us recall that our assumption on G implies that \u03a6\u02dc = \u03a6\u0302, and so \u03a6\u0302 is also\na root system.\nFor (a), let xi \u2208 U b\u03b2i for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 s. Then, for any 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 s we have that xpi = 1\nand [xi, xj] = 1, since there are no roots in \u03a6\u0302 of the form a\u03b2\u0302i + b\u03b2\u0302j for any integers\na, b \u2265 1. So H is elementary abelian of order pm(s).\nSuppose that \u03b3\u0302 \u2208 \u03a6\u0302 is any positive root and consider the commutator of the\nelements x b\u03b2i(c) \u2208 U b\u03b2i and xb\u03b3(d) \u2208 Ub\u03b3, for constants c and d in the appropriate field.\nThe Chevalley Commutator Formula [GLS, Thm. 2.4.5] gives us\n[x b\u03b2i(c), xb\u03b3(d)] =\n\u220f\na,b>0\nxa b\u03b2i+bb\u03b3(cab) ,\nwhere the product is over all positive a and b such that a\u03b2\u0302i + b\u03b3\u0302 \u2208 \u03a6\u0302, and where\nthe coefficients cab depend on a, b, c, \u03b2\u0302i and \u03b3\u0302. But then, a\u03b2\u0302i + b\u03b3\u0302 = \u03b2\u0302j for some\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 s because the height of a\u03b2\u0302i + b\u03b3\u0302 is greater than d. So [x b\u03b2i(c), xb\u03b3(d)] \u2208 H,\nHence, H is normal in U .\nFor (b), let J be the subgroup generated by all the subgroups U b\u03b2i , with t+1 \u2264 i \u2264\ns. Then J has order pm(s)\u2212m(t). From the proof of (b), we deduce that [x b\u03b2i(c), u] \u2208 J\n20 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nfor any x b\u03b2i(c) \u2208 H, and for any u \u2208 U . Thus for any xi \u2208 H, xiux\u22121i = uw, for some\nw \u2208 J . So the H-conjugacy class H \u00b7 u contains at most |J | = pm(s)\u2212m(t) elements.\nHence, the Class Equation gives\n|CH(u)| = |H||H \u00b7 u| \u2265\npm(s)\npm(s)\u2212m(t)\n= pm(t) .\nIf u \u2208 H then H \u2286 CU(u), since H is elementary abelian. Now, |H| = pm(s) \u2265\npm(t)+1, and so the part (c) holds in this case. On the other hand, suppose that\nu 6\u2208 H. Then\nCH(u) \u00d7 \u3008u\u3009 \u2264 CU(u) and |CH(u) \u00d7 \u3008u\u3009| = |CH(u)| \u00b7 |\u3008u\u3009| \u2265 pm(t)+1\nby part (b). \u00a4\nConsider now the case G = 2A2m(p) where m \u2265 2. If m = 1 then |\u2206\u0302| = 1. The\nnext result proves that when m \u2265 2 the conclusion of previous proposition applies.\nProposition 7.4. Let G = 2A2m(p) where m \u2265 2. Then for any u \u2208 U of order\np, its centralizer CU(u) in U contains an elementary abelian subgroup of p-rank at\nleast 3.\nProof. By the results in [GLS, \u00a72.4], we know that \u03a6\u0302 is the union of root systems\n\u03a6b\u03b1 of type A1 \u00d7 A1 or A2. More precisely, we have\n\u03a6b\u03b1 =\n{ { \u03b1 , \u03c4(\u03b1) } if \u03b1 + \u03c4(\u03b1) 6\u2208 \u03a6\n{ \u03b1 , \u03c4(\u03b1) , \u03b1 + \u03c4(\u03b1) } if \u03b1 + \u03c4(\u03b1) \u2208 \u03a6\nIn the first case, \u03a6b\u03b1 is of type A1 \u00d7 A1 and in the second case, \u03a6b\u03b1 is of type A2 .\nSet \u03b2i,j =\n\u2211i+j\u22121\nl=i \u03b1l , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2m+ 1\u2212 i, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2m . Hence,\n\u03a6+ = { \u03b2i,j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2m+ 1\u2212 i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2m },\nand also h(\u03b2i,j) = j , for all i, j . Let \u03c4 denote the symmetry (of order 2) acting on\nthe Dynkin Diagram. Since \u03c4(\u03b2i,j) = \u03b22m+2\u2212i\u2212j,j, exactly one of i or 2m+ 2\u2212 i\u2212 j\nis less than m for any given i. Thus, we may take\n\u03a6\u0302+ = {\u03a6d\u03b2i,j | 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2m+ 1\u2212 i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 m} ,\nNotice that \u03a6d\u03b2i,j has type A2 if and only if \u03b2i,j + \u03c4(\u03b2i,j) \u2208 \u03a6, that is, if and only if\n\u03b2i,j + \u03b22m+2\u2212i\u2212j,j =\ni+j\u22121\u2211\nl=i\n\u03b1l +\n2m+1\u2212i\u2211\nl=2m+2\u2212i\u2212j\n\u03b1l \u2208 \u03a6 .\nBut this is a root precisely when i+ j = 2m+2\u2212 i\u2212 j , by the structure of roots in\nAn. By the definition of the \u03b2i,j\u2019s, this corresponds to the case when the last index\nof the \u03b1l\u2019s appearing in the decomposition of \u03b2i,j is equal to m.\nKeeping this in mind, let us now consider the following elements of U :\nxj(t) = x\u03b21,j(t)x\u03b22m+1\u2212j,j(t\np)\nfor t \u2208 Fp2 , m+ 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2m\u2212 1 and\nx2m(t) = x\u03b21,2m(t) ,\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 21\nfor t \u2208 Fp . Let H be the subgroup of U generated by all these elements xj(t), and\nlet J be the subgroup of H generated by all the xj(t) with j \u2265 m + 2. Then, by\nthe Chevalley Commutator Formula, and [GLS, Thm. 2.4.5], the groups H and J\nare elementary abelian, of order p \u00b7 (p2)m\u22121 and p \u00b7 (p2)m\u22122, respectively. Moreover,\nby the Chevalley Commutator Formula we deduce as in the proof of Proposition 7.3\nthat H is a normal subgroup of U , and that the H-conjugacy class of any element\nof order p of U lies in J . Hence the conclusion of Proposition 7.3 still holds for\nG = 2A2m(p) , m \u2265 2, since for m \u2265 2 the index |H : J | is at least p2. \u00a4\nThe above propositions lead directly to the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.5. Let G = G\u0302(pa) be a finite group of Lie type, (as introduced at the\nbeginning of Section 4) with |\u2206\u0302| \u2265 2. Assume that G is not one of the following\ngroups\n(i) A2(p),\n(ii) B2(p),\n(iii) G2(p).\nThen any maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of U has p-rank at least 3. More-\nover, we have\n(a) T (U) \u223c= Z.\n(b) T (B) \u223c= Z\u2295X(T ).\n(c) T (G) \u223c= Z.\nIn each statement, the class of \u2126(k) generates a torsion-free subgroup of the group\nof endotrivial modules.\nProof. By Theorem 7.1, we need only consider the case when q = p. So, let us\nconsider G = G(p). First, suppose that G is an untwisted group or a Steinberg\ngroup which is not 2A2m(p). Let E be an elementary abelian p-subgroup of U of\norder p2 and consider its intersection with the unique cyclic subgroup Z of order\np in the center of U . Then E \u2229 Z has order 1 or p. In the first case, then EZ is\nelementary abelian of p-rank 3 and contains (strictly) E. In the second case, let u be\na non central element of E, and consider its centralizer CU(u). By Proposition 7.3,\nCU(u) contains an elementary abelian p-subgroup H of order at least p\nm(t)+1. Now,\nsince H and E = \u3008u\u3009 \u00d7 Z are subgroups of CU(u), and Z is central, we have that\nEH is elementary abelian of p-rank at least m(t)+1 and it contains E. In the case\nof the untwisted groups when q = p, we have m(t) + 1 \u2265 3 as long as |\u2206| \u2265 3, by\nLemma 7.2. Hence there are no maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank\n2 in U , and the result follows in the untwisted case.\nNext assume that G is a Steinberg group which is not 2A2m(p). Since \u03a6\u02dc = \u03a6\u0302,\nwe can use the same reasoning as above with the root systems given in [GLS, Prop.\n2.3.2] to deduce that all maximal elementary subgroups of U have p-rank at least 3\nin all cases except possibly 2A3(p) (\u03a6\u0302 has type C2) and\n3D4(p) (\u03a6\u0302 = G2). In the\ncase when G = 2A3(p) consider the roots \u03b21 = \u03b11 + \u03b12 and \u03b22 = 2\u03b11 + \u03b12. These\nroots satisfy the properties of Lemma 7.2 for t = 1 and s = 2. One can now apply\nProposition 7.3 with H generated by U\u03b21 and U\u03b22 to conclude that u is contained in\n22 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nan elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank at least m(t)+1 = m\u03b21+1 = 2+1 = 3.\nA similar argument holds for G = 3D4(p). Now assume that G is\n2A2m(p). For\nm > 1, the results follows by Proposition 7.4.\nFinally consider the Ree group 2F4(2\n1\n2 ). A computer run using MAGMA (cf. [BoCan])\nchecks that a Sylow 2-subgroup has order 212 = 4096 and it has two maximal ele-\nmentary abelian 2-subgroups both having order 25 = 32.\nThe second part of the theorem is a direct consequence Proposition 6.1, and\nTheorem 6.2. \u00a4\n8. Torsion-free ranks for untwisted groups\nAt this point we are left with computing the groups of endotrivial modules for\nthe finite groups G = G\u0302(q) of Lie type that are excluded from Theorem 7.5. That\nis when G is one of A2(q), B2(q), or G2(q). Notice also that Proposition 6.1\nand Theorem 6.2 handle the torsion subgroups of the groups of endotrivial mod-\nules TT (U), TT (B), and TT (G). Hence, now, we are only concerned with the\ntorsion-free groups TF (G), TF (B), and TF (U). Moreover, Theorem 7.1 reduces\nthe question to the case q = p.\nRecall that the generators of TF (U) and TF (B) can be computed from Theorem\n3.4. Our investigations enable us to exhibit only the torsion-free rank of TF (G).\nAs before, for elements in the finite groups G we follow the notation of [GLS]\n(which is the same as in [St]). For brevity, we write x\u03b1 = x\u03b1(1).\nG = A2(p): In this case, G is isomorphic to the group PSL(3, p) (cf. [GLS, \u00a72.7]).\nThe Sylow p-subgroup U of G is an extraspecial p-group of order p3 and exponent\np, if p > 2, and U is a dihedral group of order 8, in case that p = 2.\nIf p = 2, then U has two maximal elementary abelian 2-subgroups which are not\nconjugate in U or in G. Consequently, the groups TF (U), TF (B) and TF (G) have\n2-rank 2 (cf. Corollary 3.2).\nIf p > 2, then all the elements of U have order p and there are p + 1 maximal\nelementary abelian p-subgroups which are normal in U . Suppose that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\nsimple roots so that U is generated by x\u03b1, and x\u03b2. Then the elementary abelian\np-subgroups in U consist of the subgroups E0 = \u3008x\u03b1, x\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009 and Ep = \u3008x\u03b2, x\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009,\nand the subgroups Ei = \u3008x\u03b1xi\u03b2, x\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009 for i = 1, . . . , p\u22121. It is easy to check that the\nsubgroups E0, Ep, and E1 are in distinct G-conjugacy classes. On the other hand,\nthe set {Ei | i = 1, . . . , p\u2212 1} is a single B-conjugacy class. Consequently, we have\nthe following.\nTheorem 8.1. Suppose that G = A2(p). The torsion-free ranks of T (U), T (B) and\nT (G) are given in the table.\nT (U) T (B) T (G)\np = 2 2 2 2\np \u2265 3 p+ 1 3 3\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 23\nG = B2(p): Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 denote the roots with \u03b1 a short root. The cases in which\np = 2 or p = 3 can be handled by computer calculations. The computer algebra\nsystem MAGMA (cf. [BoCan]) was used to check our answers.\nIn case p = 2, we know by [Hu, Hauptsatz II.9.22] that G \u223c= \u03a36, the symmetric\ngroup on 6 letters. The Sylow 2-subgroup U has order 16 and its center is elementary\nabelian of order 4. It can be checked directly from the standard relations (cf. [St],\npage 30) that both x\u03b1 and x\u03b1+\u03b2 are in the center. Hence, there are no maximal\nelementary abelian 2-subgroups of 2-rank 2.\nIf p = 3, then U has exponent 9, since any regular element (i.e. any element of\nthe form xa\u03b1x\nb\n\u03b2x\nc\n\u03b1+\u03b2x\nd\n2\u03b1+\u03b2 with a and b both not multiples of 3) has order 9. This is\na consequence of the calculation of the unipotent variety in [CLNP]. Consequently,\nevery element of order 3 is contained in one of the subgroups\nU1 = \u3008x\u03b1, x\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009 or U2 = \u3008x\u03b2, x\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009.\nNote that U1 is elementary abelian of order 27. The subgroup U2 is an extraspecial\ngroup or order 27 and exponent 3. It has elementary abelian subgroups\nEi = \u3008x\u03b1xi\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009\nfor i = 0, 1, 2 and E3 = \u3008x\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009. The groups E0, E1, E2 are maximal ele-\nmentary abelian 3-subgroups of U , and they are conjugate in U by the powers of\nthe element x\u03b2. Also, E3 is not maximal since it is contained in U1. Consequently,\nwe have one conjugacy class of maximal elementary abelian 3-subgroup of 3-rank 2\nrepresented by the subgroup E0. Notice that, the group U has 3-rank 3. Finally, we\nshould note that E0 is not a maximal elementary abelian subgroup in G, since it is\ncontained in the elementary abelian 3-subgroup \u3008x2\u03b1+\u03b2, x\u03b1, x\u2212\u03b2\u3009 of G.\nWhen p > 3, every element of U has order p. Consider the groups\nE0 and Fr = \u3008x\u03b1xr\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009 , for 1 \u2264 r \u2264 p\u2212 1.\nA direct computation shows that the Fr\u2019s are self centralizing in U and hence are\nmaximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank 2. If y is an element of U that is\nnot in U1 or U2, then some power of y has the form y\nt = x\u03b1x\nr\n\u03b2w for some w \u2208 U1\u2229U2\nand some r. But then yt is U -conjugate to x\u03b1x\nr\n\u03b2. It follows that there are p conjugacy\nclasses of maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups of p-rank 2 of U , represented by\nthe groups F1, . . . , Fp\u22121 and by E0.\nNext we observe that all of the Fr\u2019s are conjugate in B, and thus also in G.\nFinally, the subgroup E0 is not a maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup in G,\nwhereas the Fr\u2019s remain maximal elementary abelian p-subgroups in G. Indeed,\nthese are precisely the centralizers of the unique G-conjugacy class of the regular\nelements (all conjugate to x\u03b1x\u03b2), and thus their centralizers are abelian p-groups of\np-rank equal to the Lie rank of G, since G is simple (cf. [Se]).\nWe summarize our results in the following theorem.\n24 JON F. CARLSON, NADIA MAZZA, AND DANIEL K. NAKANO\nTheorem 8.2. Let G = B2(p). The torsion-free ranks of T (U), T (B) and T (G) are\ngiven in the table.\nT (U) T (B) T (G)\np = 2 1 1 1\np = 3 2 2 1\np \u2265 5 p+ 1 3 2.\nG = G2(p): For this group, we adopt the notation in [St], and we use the relations\nfor the generators of the unipotent subgroup U as written out completely on [St, p.\n151]. Let \u03b1 and \u03b2 be the simple roots with \u03b1 a short root. Set\nU1 = \u3008x\u03b1, x\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2, x3\u03b1+\u03b2, x3\u03b1+2\u03b2\u3009 and U2 = \u3008x\u03b2, x\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2, x3\u03b1+\u03b2, x3\u03b1+2\u03b2\u3009.\nAs in the B2-case, we must handle the low primes 2, 3 and 5 separately from the\nlarger ones. Let W = U1 \u2229 U2. We have the following.\nLemma 8.3. If p = 2, 3 or 5, then the unipotent group U has no maximal elementary\nabelian p-subgroups of p-rank smaller than 3.\nProof. First notice that if p = 3, then x2\u03b1+\u03b2 and x3\u03b1+2\u03b2 are in the center of U .\nHence maximal elementary abelian 3-subgroups have 3-rank at least 3.\nFor p = 2 and p = 5, we notice that every element of order p in U is either in U1\nor in U2. This follows from the computation of the restricted unipotent variety in\n[CLNP]. The center of U1 is generated by the elements x3\u03b1+\u03b2 and x3\u03b1+2\u03b2. Therefore,\nU1 has no maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank 2. The group U2 is a\ncentral product\nU2 = \u3008x\u03b2, x3\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009 \u2217 \u3008x\u03b1+\u03b2, x2\u03b1+\u03b2\u3009\nwhere the factors are dihedral groups when p = 2 and are extraspecial 5-groups of\norder 125 and exponent 5 when p = 5. Consequently, U2 is an extraspecial group of\norder p5, and thus it has no maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank 2.\nThe lemma now follows from the fact that a maximal elementary abelian p-\nsubgroup of p-rank 2 in U would have to be contained in either U1 or in U2. \u00a4\nAssume now that p \u2265 7. Then, all the nontrivial elements in U have order p.\nAs in the previous argument, we have that U1 and U2 have no maximal elementary\nabelian p-subgroup of p-rank less than 3. So any elementary abelian p-subgroup of\np-rank 2 must be contained in the centralizer of an element of order p that is not in\neither U1 or U2. Hence any maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank 2 must\nbe in the centralizer of an element of the form x\u03b1x\nr\n\u03b2w for w \u2208W and 1 \u2264 r \u2264 p\u2212 1.\nNotice that conjugating by an appropriate element of U we can assume that w = 1.\nIn addition, we know that x\u03b1x\nr\n\u03b2 is a regular element and so, by the same argument\nas in the B2-case (cf. [Se]), we have that\nEr = \u3008x\u03b1xr\u03b2, x3\u03b1+2\u03b2\u3009\nis a maximal elementary abelian p-subgroup of p-rank 2 in both U and in G. It is\neasy to see that for all 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 p \u2212 1, Ei is conjugate to Ej in B but not in U .\nTherefore, we have proved the following.\nENDOTRIVIAL MODULES FOR FINITE GROUPS OF LIE TYPE 25\nTheorem 8.4.
