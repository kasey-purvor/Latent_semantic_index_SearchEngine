Broadly \nreflecting the \u201einterpretive turn in consumer research\u201f (Sherry, 1991) and a relational \naccount of marketing (e.g. Baron, 1996; Gummerson, 1993), the paper concerns both \nthe ontological status and the interpersonal ambivalence of service encounters in an \nera supposedly marked by widespread expectations of excellence and exceptionality \n(Peters & Waterman, 1994). We intend to contribute to what has recently been \ndubbed \u201econsumer culture theory\u201f (Arnould & Thompson, 2005), but seek to question \na concern with the human subject as prime object of investigation.  We do this in part \nby refusing to split the processes of production and consumption (Firat & Venkatash, \n1995) and instead focusing on service encounters as sites for the mutual constitution \nof identities. We argue that they can do this by constructing the image of a phantom \nthat we call \u201eThe Guest\u201f which has an ontology which challenges conventional \nclassifications of reality and fantasy. In order to argue this, we employ the work of \n 4 \nG\u00fcnther Anders, a German critical theorist who has not figured in consumer research, \nbut whose analytical thrust provides important insights and extends considerations \nabout the fundamentally relational and political ontology of the service relationship \n(Bagozzi, 1995; Hochschild, 1983). \n \nIn the Grand Seaside Hotel, the staff claimed to be attempting to meet (or even \nexceed) customer expectations, but it appeared that this was a matter that could not \nmerely be confined to the management of technical parameters (Price et al., 1995). \nFor example, when consumers seek mythical, fantastic, or extraordinary experiences, \nthe affective content of service encounters becomes critical.  Thus, when experiencing \n\u201eRiver Magic\u201f during river rafting trips (Arnould & Price, 1993); when consuming \n\u201eThe American West\u201f at Rodeos (Peneloza, 2001); or when re-creating \u201ethe Mountain \nMan Myth\u201f with fellow mountain men and women in the \u201eRockies\u201f (Belk & Costa, \n1998), consumers playfully, imaginatively, and collectively connect to nature, \nmythology or fantasy.  In fact, such experience is socially constructed in direct \nopposition to the profane world of daily routines and role definitions. Importantly, the \nconstruction of a shared exceptionality is a collective endeavour (Greissman & \nMayes, 1977) but its evaluation is a subjective matter (Denzin, 1983).  Triggered by \nunusual events, \u201eextraordinary experience is characterized by high levels of emotional \nintensity and experience \u2026 [and] \u2026 implies neither superior levels of effort nor an \nindependent relational mode.\u201f(Arnould & Price, 1993: 25).  This means that \n\u201esatisfaction may have little to do with whether the experience unfolds as expected\u201f; \nrather, it results from an entire \u201enarrative of experience\u201f in relation to \u201ean array of \nculturally informed, preconscious scripts\u201f (Arnould & Price, 1993: 42). In other \n 5 \nwords, to experience exceptionality personally, the subject requires a prior relation \nwith a wide range of objects and narratives.  \n \nThe fact that the experience and evaluation of extraordinary experience can not be \nentirely determined through bureaucratic mechanisms which ensure predictability \nconstitutes a formidable challenge to service providers (Alba & Hutchinson, 2000). \nCustomers who \u201eexpect the unexpected\u201f could only have a vague understanding of \nwhat it is that they desire, and are presumably not capable of articulating these \nexpectations.  This would then seem to demand high levels of sensitivity, empathy, \nand creativity as well as social and emotional competence from those who design or \nparticipate in the conduct of service encounters. Yet when it comes to actually \nproducing the extraordinary, it is not only service providers\u201f ingenuity and \nimagination that is put to the test when seeking to \u201egive their customers something \nthey do not know how to ask for\u201f (Arnould & Price, 1993: 25).  In addition, \u201eto be \neffective, it must transcend the purposive, task oriented, and commercial nature of the \nordinary service interaction\u201f (ibid: 27).  Spontaneity and the breaching of scripts are \nindispensable and hence the responsible autonomy of service providers is vital. At the \nsame time, however, their imagination must be tamed and directed at goals and \nactions that contribute to customer satisfaction and sustain corporate norms and \nvalues \u2013 something that, as we claim, that ultimately amounts to a \u201ecorporate \ncolonization of fantasy\u201f (Bunzel, 2007).  Thus, there is a fundamental tension between \nthe supposed indeterminacy of service encounters aimed at providing extraordinary \nexperiences, and the corporate prerogative to manage such encounters. The participant \n(provider or customer) must believe they are acting as an autonomous human, even if \nnon-human structures are shaping their action. \n 6 \n \nDrawing on vignettes selected from data collected during fourteen months of \nethnography by the first author (2), we will describe the strategies and practices \nemployed to manage such encounters and to provide service \u201ebeyond customers\u201f \nexpectations\u201f. We will see how staff at the hotel use meetings and training sessions to \nsimulate service scenarios based on hypothesised customer wants.  In order to do this \nthey devise the image of an ideal guest that is recurrently evoked to both inform and \nshape conduct. Drawing on a small selection of the data, the first part of the paper \nelaborates the processes by which hotel guests are constituted as objects of \nknowledge. We try to show how information routinely gathered about guests\u201f \nperceptions and preferences is practically enhanced by simulated service scenarios \nintended to improve service provision.  The knowledge thus established is then fed \nback into the actual conduct of \u201ereal\u201f service encounters, where staff are asked \u201eto \nexpect the unexpected\u201f in an attempt to \u201eexceed customers\u201f expectations\u201f. It is this \nideal guest, or imaginary customer, that provides the mediation between autonomy \nand constraint. A non-human fiction, with endless potential demands, solicits conduct \nthat can be understood to be authentically human. \n \nWithin this continuing simulation of service encounters there is a blurring of the lines \nbetween the \u201eactual\u201f and the \u201ehypothetical\u201f, between \u201epresence\u201f and \u201eabsence\u201f. As a \nresult the (ontological) status of the object constructed is not obvious. Using the work \nof the German social theorist G\u00fcnther Anders we will identify the simulation of \ncustomer service as implying a de-materialization of service encounters and will term \nthe product of this process \u201eThe Guest\u201f. We, and Anders, argue that The Guest is \nneither real nor imaginary, but a non-human \u201ePhantom\u201f which has real consequences \n 7 \n(Anders 1956\/2002). We go on to address in more depth the process of producing \nPhantoms and scrutinise the relationship between producers and (their) product.  We \nwill see that Phantoms emerge from a process of simulation which is marked by a \nfundamental reversibility of subject and object.  Contrary to the idea that it is the \nsubject who is in charge of production \u2013 shaping, forming, and possessing the object \naccording to its will \u2013 The Guest allows us to see this process in a different light. The \nobject might well be submissive, but it is certainly not passive. Simulations grant the \nobject a special power; one that allows it to overthrow the apparent dominance of the \nsubject and to direct the relationship in its own favour. \n \nHaving established the seductive power of the (imaginary) object, we will move to \ninvestigating that power in more detail.  Can (imaginary) objects dominate subjects?  \nWe shall see that, in part, any power that they have is grounded in the condition of the \ncontemporary subject.  Its feeling of insufficiency in the face of the objects it has \nproduced induces a sense of what Anders calls \u201ePromethean shame\u201f.  At the societal \nlevel, this leads to a mass-individuation \u2013 a detachment of modern people from their \nvarious social worlds. For both Anders, objects play a pivotal role in this \nindividuation. As the encounter with a mirror might trigger identity-formation in early \nchildhood, contemporary objects (as quasi-mirrors) provide a reference for the \ncreation of (collective) identity. So the image of The Guest contributes to the \ngeneration of a Grand Seaside Family. We conclude that it is The Guest, rather than \nthe subjects, that appears to be sovereign.  According to Anders, such a development \nis to be expected. He argues that we have moved from a modern society rooted in the \nideas and values of enlightenment \u2013 with a sovereign subject at its centre and \n 8 \nproduction as the foundation of society \u2013 to a stage that is governed by objects and \ncodes.  \n \nOf course, these are speculative concepts. We are not suggesting that there is no \nresistance to Phantoms, because in the Grand Seaside there was (Bunzel et al 2002). \nNeither are we suggesting that that this is an inexorable development, because that \nvery much remains to be seen. And we are certainly not suggesting that this is a \nneutral process that is in some way independent of the management and organization \nof capitalism (Parker 2002). But these issues lie in the background here, because what \nwe are trying to do is to use some empirical data, and some theory, in order to begin a \nrethinking of the ontology of the customer. Like the \u201eimplicit reader\u201f (Iser, 1972) that \nany author conjures as they write, so is the figure of the imagined \u201ecustomer\u201f \nbecoming more important in organizational life. When something becomes important, \neven if its ontological status is unclear, it begins to shape the trajectories of the \nsubjects who surround it. We will begin by looking at the birth of The Guest. \n \nMaking Little Things Count \n \nLet us visit the Grand Seaside Hotel \u2013 a five-star luxury hotel, located in a small town \non the Australian East Coast.  At the time of our arrival, the hotel has just undergone a \nchange in ownership that instigated a comprehensive reorganization (3). Its aim was \nto streamline operations and turn the hotel into a more profitable organization. Tim \nChang, the newly appointed General Manager, focussed on improving the provision \nof customer service within the hotel.  Tim\u201fs concern with service excellence derived \nfrom his conviction that: \n 9 \n\u201eNowadays, customer service is the key to survival in an ever more competitive \nmarket.  I have to do more than the other competitors; I have to provide service-\nexcellence, really outstanding service.  I can only do that by listening to what \nthe customer says and by listening to my staff.  But, actually, it\u201fs about more.  \nIt\u201fs not just meeting customers\u201f expectations; that\u201fs what all do.  It means \nexceeding them, providing service beyond the customer\u201fs expectation, that\u201fs my \nphilosophy.  And you can only do that by training your people properly.\u201f \nTim did everything to get his philosophy across to management and staff.  In addition \nto the regular management meetings (the \u201eMorning Briefings\u201f) and events such as the \nannual All-Staff-Meeting, he used the monthly hotel newsletter, the notice board, and \neven the walls of the staff canteen.  Moreover, he introduced a customer service \nprogram that was designed and run by Di and Leo, two members of the management \nteam. This programme was called \u201eMake the Little Things Count\u201f and the trainers \nused their sessions to raise staff awareness of \u201elittle things\u201f in service delivery.  These \ndays, they told their audience, merely meeting customers\u201f demands was no longer \nenough.  Top-class companies have to go beyond that stage, and must deliver \u201eservice \nthat exceeds customer expectations!\u201f  It is precisely those little things, the trainers \nexplained, the anticipation of customers\u201f needs and wants, that determine the quality \nof service delivery and which ultimately define service excellence. \n \nTo make their message clearer Di, Leo, and another employee performed a short role-\nplay at the beginning of their opening training session.  In this scene \u2013 based on an \nencounter that had taken place just a few days ago \u2013 a room cleaner on duty \ndiscovered a young mother trying to feed her baby with a bottle. The baby was crying \nand the cleaner suspected that the milk in the bottle was too cold.  With the mother \n 10 \nappearing rather inexperienced and needing help, the cleaner offered to warm up the \nbottle.  The mother agreed, and when the cleaner returned with the warm milk, the \nbaby calmed down and drank his bottle. The trainers explained to staff that the mother \nwas \u201eover the moon\u201f and went to the General Manager to thank the cleaner for her \neffort.  This was precisely the sort of proactive approach that is expected and that \nwould be appreciated and rewarded. That is why management had introduced the \n\u201eMake the Little Things Count\u201f reward programme. Each employee was eligible to \nnominate other staff for a reward and management would decide the winners (4). The \ntrainers concluded the session stressing that winners would be announced on a \nmonthly basis. They would receive a gift-voucher, one hundred Australian dollars and \na T-shirt carrying the newly designed logo of the programme on the front and the \nsentence \u201eI Made a Little Thing Count\u201f on the back. \n \nImaginary Service Encounters \n \nThe customer service training program was partly informed by results from \nquestionnaires left in guests\u201f rooms.  Elsa, Tim\u201fs secretary, entered the information \ngathered from the questionnaires into a database and announced the latest responses at \nthe Morning Briefings.  Managers would also commonly report on their own \nexperiences, acting as a surrogate for guests\u201f evaluation of the service. These latter \nimaginary service encounters rested on the projection of hypothetical wants of equally \nhypothetical guests and constituted a sort of climax in Tim\u201fs efforts to create a culture \nof service excellence.  Effectively, staff were being encouraged to employ the gaze of \nan imaginary customer and point out deficiencies in the provision of customer service.  \nThe following sequence, taken from one of the Morning Briefings, is illustrative: \n 11 \nTim: \u201eJust a reminder to you that the front-desk is a public area for customer \nservice and not for socializing of staff; even if they are not busy with a guest at \nthat moment.  Sometimes when you pass by there, the guys from concierge are \nchatting with each other or hanging around.  This does not lead to a good \nimpression, if guests are passing by.  This morning I saw even Celine [an \nadministrative assistant] standing around there having a chat with some of the \nguys.  I mean, she is not even from reservations; so what does she have to do \nthere?  So, please inform your staff: The front-desk is not a staff room!  It\u201fs not \na chatting area!\u201f \n \nOften, Tim would also point at the aesthetic dimension of the service experience, \nsometimes rather bluntly. \nTim: \u201eWhere is Housekeeping?\u201f  (He gazes around the table.) \nElsa: \u201eShe\u201fs not in today.\u201f \nTim: \u201eOkay. Then tell her that the area around the hotel looks like (he hesitates \nfor a moment.) well, it really looks like shit!  So, they have to clean it regularly!\u201f \nOn another occasion, Tim criticized Amanda, a cleaning staff supervisor. \nTim: \u201eI just wanted to remind you that you have to put the slippery sign away.  \nIt\u201fs such a nice gangway from The Garden Terrace to the pool and then you \nhave this ugly sign there.\u201f \nThe reference to imaginary service encounters was by no means Tim\u201fs prerogative.  \nOther managers also adopted this formulation in order to more or less explicitly \nremind their colleagues of certain responsibilities.  One of the Security Managers, for \ninstance, claimed that the car park \u201ehas become the most messy place in the whole \nhotel  an insult to our guests\u201f. As far as we know, no guest had complained. On other \n 12 \noccasions, participants in the meeting reminded Bill, the maintenance Engineer, that \nsome light bulbs had to be changed or that one of the toilet flushes was not working \nproperly.  Others informed the meeting about dirty carpets, empty bottles around the \npool area, or the inappropriate dress code of staff members.  Although such comments \nwere mainly uttered in a rather helpful voice, dropped in as a \u201eby the way, I just \nwanted to let you know that...\u201f, the people addressed often seemed embarrassed and \nusually responded apologetically. \n \nThe Grand Seaside Family \n \nThe simulation of imaginary service encounters was complemented by another \nelement: the simulation of \u201ecommunity\u201f as the Grand Seaside Family (see Parker \n2002: 66 passim). This was most impressively invoked during the annual All-Staff-\nMeeting which marked the end of the financial year and was usually the occasion for \ncommunicating achievements and honouring exceptional performance. On this \noccasion staff were assured of their value to the hotel, somewhat concealing the recent \nhistory of dismissals during the re-organization. Tim was keen to stress that the recent \nincrease in profits ultimately resulted from the extraordinary performance of the staff. \nHannah, the Director of Marketing, even suggested that there was a communal bond \nbetween management and staff that was also visible to guests. \nHannah: \u201eWe had some focus groups throughout the year, which is basically a \nget-together with our guests, and it\u201fs a very useful marketing tool.  So we talked \nto some of our return guests about what they like and why they come back.  And \nguess what they said why they are coming back?  It\u201fs not because of the location \nor the beach or whatsoever.  It's because of you!  It's because of the staff and the \n 13 \nservice they experience here!  And, do you know what else they want?  They \nlike to be informed about us, about what's going on here.  They like to be in \ntouch.  They want to be part of the family: The Grand Seaside Hotel Family!\u201f \n \nThe cosy image evoked was visualized by a slide that Matilda, the Director of Human \nResources, presented at the end of her presentation.  The slide showed a cartoon in \nwhich two groups of three people were engaging in a tug of war.  The whole scene is \nlocated on a tiny island, which provides just enough space for the six people to stand.  \nThis small island appears like a platform above the water; a platform surrounded by \nhuge crocodiles with widely opened mouths.  The rope on which both groups are \npulling is already tearing apart, so that each group is about to fall into the sea and get \ncaught by the crocodiles. \nMatilda: \u201eYes, this makes it clear. We are a great team here, and only by \nworking together will we succeed.\u201f \nThese sequences were symptomatic of the powerfully \u201estaged\u201f character of collective \nlife at the Grand Seaside. For example, consider the way that the Human Resource \nDepartment handled its work. Apart from turning the Human Resource Office into an \ninformal meeting place for staff and for the general exchange of hotel gossip, the \nHuman Resource managers sent out cards for birthdays or anniversaries, organized \nsocial events, and made inquiries into the well-being of people on sick leave. Tim \nclaimed that all staff were considered members of the same family. Hence, he and \nother senior mangers usually took their meals in the staff canteen surrounded by \nreceptionists, waitresses, and cleaners. Tim founded the Hotel\u201fs Social Club, which \norganized events such as outdoor activities or theatre visits. Even the supply of free \n 14 \nmeals to staff and the provision of training were seen to be part of that sense of \nfamilial care and understood to underline management\u201fs dedication to staff. \n \nAnders: Industrial Platonism and De-Materialization \n \n\u201eThe subjects of freedom and un-freedom have been exchanged.  Things are \nfree: men are un-free.\u201f (Anders, 1956\/2002: 33) (5) \n \nAt first sight, the object constituted within this discourse of customer service at the \nGrand Seaside, \u201eThe Guest\u201f, seems somewhat elusive. It does not seem to have \nparticularly corporeal or specific qualities because in most cases The Guest does not \nrefer to any particular guest, or time, or place. The Guest could be virtually anyone, \nanywhere, at any time.  In fact, its elusive omnipresence grants The Guest a somewhat \nPanoptic quality. Constant submission to the gaze of The Guest structures life at the \nGrand Seaside.  In their desire to please this ghostly spectator, staff subjugate \nthemselves to virtually limitless demands, as stipulated by the doctrine of service \nexcellence (Bunzel et al, 2002).  So while The Guest seems more than a passing idea, \nor a turn of phrase, we would probably hesitate to call it a thing. And, while our Guest \nis not corporeal, it is certainly the manifestation of a certain strategy. It is an object of \nhuman intervention and manipulation. Further, while seemingly a product of human \nimagination, it is nonetheless quite \u201ereal\u201f in its consequences, having a profound \nimpact upon organizational life. The chocolate you found on your pillow in the hotel \nroom is the end result of the demands of The Guest. It thus assumes a certain form of \nagency \u2013 being something like a \u201esubjectified object\u201f. In other word, this imaginary \n 15 \nbut subject-like object is, what G\u00fcnther Anders would call, a Phantom, as we shall \nnow see. \n \nAnders\u201f writings have gone virtually unnoticed outside the German-speaking \nacademic community, despite his close intellectual relations with the Frankfurt School \n(6).  Born in 1902 in Breslau to the famous child-psychologists William and Clara \nStern; he was a student of Cassirer, Panofsky, Heidegger and Husserl, and was briefly \nmarried to Hannah Arendt (7). A self-proclaimed \u201eoccasional philosopher\u201f \n(Gelegenheitsphilosoph) and winner of the Adorno prize; he was also a vigorous \npeace-activist, particularly involved in anti-Vietnam protests, and an icon of the anti-\nnuclear movement in Germany. He died in 1992, and was arguably among the most \noriginal and certainly the politically most outspoken and significant theorists in post-\nWW II Austria and Germany.  Based on his philosophical studies and inspired by \nvarious jobs he held as an emigrant from Nazi-Germany to the U.S., he aspired to \nprovide a theory of the human condition in an era of Fordist production and mass \nconsumption.  His concern with the social consequences of technology and mass-\nmedia has produced a considerable body of writings containing a rich reservoir of \ningenious insights and prefiguring (almost literally) Baudrillard\u201fs concept of \nhyperreality by two decades.  Perhaps it is the somewhat fragmented, thematically and \nstylistically diverse character of his writings \u2013 comprising of philosophical essays, \ncollections of aphorisms, novels, and even poems \u2013 that has contributed to his neglect. \nHence, without being able to do any justice to his work, we will introduce some of the \nconcepts that we think are relevant for this paper. \n \n 16 \nAnders saw the emergence of Fordist mass-production and consumption \u2013 most \nnotably the emergence of modern mass media \u2013 as hallmarks of an era in which \nreproduction has become the central value of society. The ever-increasing complexity \nand efficiency of modern technology provoke very ambiguous consequences.  The \npower that humankind derives from the technologies it has produced, including its \npotential to destroy the earth, turns against it culturally, economically and \npsychologically. Culturally and economically, our relationship to the object world has \nbeen turned on its head with the emergence of technologically induced mass-\nproduction and consumption.  For Anders, technological artefacts become the true \nsubjects of history, while humankind becomes a supplement to the world of objects. \nPsychologically, the speed of technological development induces a fundamental \nimbalance between the human capacity to produce technological artefacts and our \ncapability to master or even imagine the consequences of their application. As a \nresult, human existence becomes rather outdated, and humans become characterised \nby a certain sort of inadequacy, or shame. \n \nWith the advent of Fordism, our affiliation with objects has gained prominence over \nour relationships with human beings. The status of these objects, however, is in doubt, \nas the prevalence of serial reproduction and mass consumption renders the idea or \nblueprint more important than the thing itself.  Planning and simulation have become \npervasive to the extent that any enactment amounts to a mere replication of whatever \nwas already designed for that purpose. Modern warfare, with its meticulously planned \nand its computer simulated and orchestrated forms of \u201eengagement\u201f, seems the most \ndramatic example of this general tendency. Today \n 17 \n\u201e... ideas are primary and real, because effective, these minutely drawn and \ncalculated blueprints and ideals [Vorbilder] (8). These ideals will then be \nreplicated with the material of reality.\u201f (Anders, 1970\/1994: 115) \nIn other words, we are witnessing an ontological shift, with ideas beginning to \noutweigh their incarnation. For example, as many people have suggested, intellectual \nproperty and the ownership of knowledge have become a crucial form of capital \nwithin the economic sphere. Anders here identifies the advent of what he calls a \nsecond Platonic age, where \u201ethe idea\u201f becomes pivotal to (what we would call today) \nthe knowledge economy. \n \nCorresponding to this new Platonism, serial existence becomes the credo and the \ncriterion of modernity, as reproduction turns into the ultimate purpose of production, \nand the objects thus (re)produced \u2013 e.g. TV images, newspaper reports or photographs \n\u2013 render the ultimate proof of truth and reality. \u201eToday, the only objective statements \nare those made by objects\u201f (Anders, 1956\/2002: 60). Faced with the ontological and \nsocial authority granted to objects, the human condition becomes problematic. For \nAnders, human beings suffer from a double inferiority when compared to the serial \nproduct. Humans cannot be preserved nor can they be reproduced as clones. Serial \nproduction, in this sense, is no less than \u201eindustrial reincarnation\u201f, a claim to \nimmortality, the attempt to prevent decay and death by being (infinitely) reproduced.  \nConsequently, Anders suggests, humans begin to desire to emulate mass-products, to \nhave a serial existence just like all the other products.  The object can not die until the \nidea of it dies (Anders, 1956\/2002: 52).  Industrial Platonism, as Anders puts it, \ngrants immortality precisely because of the primacy and endurance of ideas. \n \n 18 \nIndustrial Platonism also implies a de-materialization of social relationships \u2013 ideas or \nimages replace substance and matter.  This is exemplified in widespread iconomania: \nan obsessive desire for the production, consumption and adoration of images (Anders, \n1956\/2002).  Today, most people derive their knowledge about the world from media \nthat pretend to give us virtually instant access to information about events in places \nunfamiliar and remote to us.  This pseudo presence that TV bestows upon us \u2013 Anders \nuses the example of the live-coverage of a football-match \u2013 passes for a \u201efirst-hand \nimpression\u201f when it is just a series of images, an electronic reproduction of the real \nevent.  Our access to the world (reality) has become so mediated that Anders \nsuggests: \n\u201eOnce, there were images in the world; today there is the world-in-image; more \ncorrectly: the world as image (1980\/2002: 250 emphasis in original). \nIn other words, \u201ereality turns into an image of the representations made of it\u201f \n(1956\/2002: 179).   \n \nWhat is presented to us, Anders claims, is a Phantom. This is an image of real events \nthat is no longer a mere representation but has instead gained supremacy over reality, \ngradually but persistently supplanting it. Using the example of the football match, a \ngoal that is broadcasted around the globe in the form of its various replications \u2013 first, \nas a \u201elive\u201f TV picture; then, again and again, from various angles; yet again, zoomed \nin and out; eventually decelerated in slow motion and frozen \u2013 assumes a reality of its \nown that seems, indeed, superior to what the spectators saw in the stadium.  Hence, \nPhantoms are neither real nor (entirely) fictitious. They represent reality as much as \nthey shape it.  They are \u201emoulds\u201f that shape the world (9), and this is a world in which \nreality and the reproductions made of it are indistinguishable. \n 19 \n\u201eReality is produced only through reproduction; only in its plural form, as series, \ndoes \u201eBeing\u201f exist\u201f (ibid. 180). \nAgainst the alleged materialism of our time, Anders suggests that we are witnessing \nthe dawning of a new sort of idealism. We are facing the menace of a de-materialized \nworld comprising of images and ideas and where substance and matter have become \nghostly. \n \nAnders at the Grand Seaside \n \nIf we think about what Anders might make of the Grand Seaside, we find that the \norganizational world might have partly become de-materialized in the way he \nsuggests.  The omnipresent image of The Guest seems as ontologically elusive as one \nof Anders\u201f Phantoms. The Guest, as staff and management imagine it, carries a strong \nclaim to represent the reality of service provision.  If this was built upon the \ncharacteristics of \u201ereal\u201f hotel-guests, such as complaints about the dirty towels or \nunfriendly staff, it might not surprise us. However, the claim to represent reality also \napplies in instances when \u2013 as in the case of the slippery floor sign or the dirty \nparking lot \u2013 the service scenarios established are purely fictitious. Even though no \nguest has actually complained, The Guest\u201fs view is accepted as authentic and valid, as \nrepresenting the reality of service provision at the hotel (10). \n \nYet, the image of The Guest does is not confined to representing reality, to being \nmerely a depiction of events at the hotel.  By being presented at the Morning \nBriefings, the claims of The Guest are incorporated into the strategies and conduct of \nservice provision at the hotel. Organizational life at the Grand Seaside carries a strong \n 20 \nimaginary element.  This image, or imaginary, both reflects and shapes organizational \nlife, a Phantom with the power to mould everyday life. This represents a de-\nmaterialization, a tendency to ground conduct in an idea of service provision, of what \ncustomers may or may not want, need or desire. The peak of this organizational \nPlatonism could be imagined to happen when the hypothetical demands of The Guest \nbecome more important than the wants, needs, or desires of real guests. After all, one \ncould argue that The Guest does not authentically represent the wishes or demands of \nreal guests. If no guest actually complains about the slippery sign, it might be because \nno guest perceives it as a problem. Yet the representational claim becomes even more \nforceful, dramatic, and perhaps absurd when staff are congratulated or admonished \nbased on hypothetical service scenarios \u2013 as it is common practice during the Morning \nBriefings. The Guest and its imaginary demands are granted a level of authority that \neven outweighs the real. In a Hegelian twist, the subjects that created this object have \nnow been subjected to its demands (11).  The power of the (imaginary) object has \nturned these subjects from Master into Servant.  The object has become liberated \n(Anders, 1956\/2002). \n \nManufactured Needs and Tamed Fantasy \n \nYet the very idealism that characterizes the second Platonic age has another, socio-\neconomic, dimension; one that is equally relevant to the Grand Seaside. In a historical \nexcursus in his later work (1980\/2002), Anders identifies the first industrial revolution \nas evolving around the production of commodities (products of a first degree), while \nthe second stage concerns the manufacturing of needs (as second-degree products) \ncorresponding to these commodities.  It does this with the help of an industry, \n 21 \nadvertising, deliberately designed for that purpose.  In fact, Anders envisages the \nemergence of advertising as a hallmark of the condition of the modern person: \n\u201eOur present day finitude is not constituted by the fact that we are, animalia \nindigenia, needy beings; but, as we actually need too little, (\u2026) by our lack of \nlack\u201f (Anders, 1980\/2002: 17) \nBut he does not stop here. The third industrial revolution, he claims, is marked by a \ntendency to constitute the possible in the form of an individual and social obligation \nto assume \u201ethat we always must (do) what we can (do)\u201f (Anders, 1980\/2002: 17). This \ntendency includes even the possibility of human self-destruction through the \nproduction of atomic weapons.  Thus, nuclear energy is the symbol of the third and, to \nAnders, the final stage of industrial revolution.   \n \nHowever, this tendency to render everything that is possible desirable, or even \nmandatory, implies that the whole world is turned into a resource.  This applies \nequally to humankind, which is rendered into a resource for the creation of new \nmeans of production.  Hence, for Anders, the whole world turns into an asset to be \nexploited and is no longer a \u201eworld-in-itself\u201f but a \u201eworld-for-us\u201f.  This is a world in \nwhich: \n\u201e\u2026we chase products that we actually do not need.  In fact, we know neither \ntheir use nor the corresponding need \u2013 both have still to be invented and created\u201f \n(ibid.: 33). \nAt the same time, all \u201ebeings become correlates of their usefulness\u201f \u2013 a tendency that \nAnders treats with hostility, warning that \u201e[a]nalogous to the Nazi-term \u201clife unworthy \nof living\u201d we have created \u201cbeings unworthy of existing\u201d\u201f (ibid.: 33).  Effectively, \n 22 \n\u201ebeing a resource has become criterium existendi\u201f, unless you are useful you should \nnot be (ibid.: 33). \n \nThe third industrial revolution is therefore a contradictory era. The incessant \n(re)production and satisfaction of infinite needs thrives on a ruthless and relentless \nexploitation of the very conditions of their reproduction.  This is what grants this third \nrevolution its, ultimately, self-destructive quality. For Anders, (capitalist) \nreproduction implies destruction, as any product we produce must be destroyed (i.e. \nconsumed) as quickly as possible to generate a need for yet another product.  From \nthe perspective of industry, he claims, \u201ethere should be no usage, only relentless \nconsumption\u201f whilst everything must be turned into a consumer good (Anders, \n1980\/2002: 44). This is what grants consumer goods \u2013 and we may want to add, \nservices too \u2013 their ephemeral quality. They can only exist when being consumed. \nThe ontology of the third industrial revolution is then a negative ontology (ibid. 46), a \nform of being that is continually searching for its own annihilation. \n \nSuch a negative ontology also constitutes life at the Grand Seaside Hotel.  Incessantly, \nnew needs and wants \u2013 even those suspected of hypothetical guests \u2013 are invented and \ncreated to fuel the process of service (re)production.  Any potential need, want or \ndesire; any physiological or mental condition is subjected to this cycle of production \nand consumption by the very ambition to \u201eexceed customer expectations\u201f.  Neither \nstaff nor guest are allowed to be complacent, as both are asked \u201eto expect the \nunexpected\u201f within the imaginary of service excellence. Nevertheless, not every want \nand need is equally met; not every possibility to please the guest is realized.  Guest \ncomplaints about the weather, about the opening hours of the hotel bar, or about \n 23 \nprices for food or beverages are regularly rejected.  Further, not all guests carry equal \nweight when expressing their wants or needs.  Children, for example, are commonly \nperceived as \u201etrouble makers\u201f.  Their desire to stroll around the hotel, to play in the \nlobby or to sing and shout in the hotel restaurant are seen as illegitimate, as they \nimpact upon the service experience of other guests and thus threaten the smooth flow \nof service (re)production (12). Hence, limits to the creation of wants and needs are \ndefined by what can be controlled by the system of service reproduction itself.  This is \nalso where the general obligation to anticipate, meet, and exceed guest expectations \nstops; where the \u201ecult of the customer\u201f (du Gay & Salaman, 1992) loses its spell. \n \nTo Anders, such limits results from an imagination that is encapsulated into an closed \nsystem. Within the logic of the service encounter, the demands are potentially \nlimitless, yet at the same time are entirely bound to the principles of reproduction. \nBut, echoing Foucault, this not a form of power that actors perceive as simply \npreventing them from being free. \n\u201eAs the gates are wide open, as the walls between us and the system have been \nremoved, as we live in congruence with its content, it has become self-evident to \nus what we are allowed to imagine [and] to keep alive the illusion of freedom to \nus and all others \u2013 to what extent we may transgress the limits of the system\u201f \n(Anders, 1980\/2002: 186). \nThus tamed, our imagination loses much of its transgressive quality, its possibility for \nescape.  Today, the \u201erole of fantasy is reduced to that of a cadence. Cadences are \nembedded into fixed note-textures and are placed at fixed positions. The tones that \nthey modify are always pre-given, although we do not experience this fact as a \nlimitation.\u201f (Anders, 1980\/2002: 186). \n 24 \n \nSo, as grammar structures language, the logic of service excellence, as routinely \noutlined at the Morning Briefings, has shaped staff imagination to the degree that they \ndo no longer recognize its limitations.  The image of The Guest, and the authority \ngranted to his desires, wants, and needs conceals the disciplinary character of his \nmight.  As Anders puts it: \n\u201eWe obey all the more willingly, as we do not perceive the rules to which we \nhave become subjected, as the latter are disguised through our inability to even \nconceive of any alternative to what we are supposed to wish \u2026 This conformist \nsystem \u2026 has conditioned us avant la lettre, so it can be generous and maintain \nits liberal outlook. Yet it is liberal (not in spite of but) because it is an integral \nsystem.  It is terrorist (not in spite of but) because it is gentle.  And, we are its \nvictims (not in spite of but) because we do not realize our serfdom.  If this \nsystem gives us authority for our doings, it does this because our authority is its \ndoing.\u201f (Anders, 1980\/2002: 186f.). \nIt could be argued that the discourse of service excellence at the Grand Seaside Hotel \nhas assumed a totalitarian quality, rather like a form of corporate culturalism that \nenhances behavioural controls with ideological ones.  Staff, management, and guests \nare moulded into a system of service (re)production that passes \u201eslavery as freedom\u201f \n(Willmott, 1993, Parker 2000). The Guest always wants something more, sparkling \nwater in the room, free peanuts at the bar. Their demands must be imagined, and \nobeyed, even if no actual guest has asked for their toilet rolls to be folded into a point \nand sealed with a silver sticker. Effectively, service provision at the Grand Seaside \nHotel thrives upon a corporate colonization of fantasy. \n \n 25 \nThe Mirror of Collective Identity \n \nSo we might suggest that The Guest moulds staff, management, and customers\n \n(13) at \nthe Grand Seaside, but we have not yet established where the power of that image \nderives from.  Tentatively, we might suggest that The Guest is an example of an \nimage that overwhelms with its sheer perfection. It is \u201e\u00fcberschwellig\u201f (14), as Anders \n(1970\/1994) puts it - it fills our senses, and inspires a sort of awe. \n \nTo appreciate this definition and grasp what Anders hints at with the term \n\u201e\u00fcberschwellig\u201f, we shall briefly explore some of the tenets of his \u201enegative \nanthropology\u201f.  With this designation Anders \u2013 inspired by German philosophical \nanthropologists Arnold Gehlen and Helmut Plessner \u2013 wishes to convey that \u201ethe \nessence of a person is precisely in not having any\u201f (van Dyjk, 2000: 29).  In contrast \nto animals, humans are a \u201eMangelwesen\u201f, a species characterized by a lack of instincts \nand inborn traits, ill equipped for survival and adaptation to the world (Gehlen, 1986).  \nIn that respect, a (wo)man is a stranger in this world. Yet, this primary deficiency also \ngives rise to human freedom, and not the dominance of instinct that we find in other \nanimals. Consequently, human \u201enature\u201f develops through encounters with the object-\nworld.  This is the human condition: both being in the world and being detached from \nit. Being \u201efree from the world in the world\u201f (Anders, 1956\/2002). \n \nWith the second and third industrial revolutions, and the massive and speedy advance \nof science, technology, and (capitalist) production, human products are now so much \nfaster, stronger, and more accurate than humans that we cannot possibly hope to \nmatch them.  In the face of the sheer perfection of its objects, the subject diminishes. \n 26 \nIt marvels at its objects while at the same time is thrown back upon its own \ndeficiencies. From that results a sense of insufficiency \u2013 a \u201ePromethean shame\u201f for \nAnders. This is the shame of not being like the things that we have made (15), the \nshame of being born flawed and not being produced perfect. For Anders, human \nbeings attempt to eradicate their deficiencies by \u201edeserting into the camp of the \nobjects\u201f, by using clothing, make-up, plastic surgery, genetic manipulation and so on. \nSo human beings inhabit the world, but only vis-\u00e0-vis the object-world.  Their \n\u201enature\u201f, their identity, thus develops in uneasy relation with this object-world, \nmarked by the \u00dcberschwelligkeit perfection of that which we have made and the \nPromethean shame that they cause in us.  \n \nFor Anders, our partial separation from the world of objects is an inescapable part of \nthe human condition.  Individuation results from \u201edividuation\u201f; or vision from division \nas Cooper puts it (1997). Identity requires detachment from the world, an initial \nseparation from that which grounds our sense of who \u201ewe\u201f are. For example, in his \ncollection of essays titled Glance from the Moon (1970\/1994), Anders \u2013 drawing on \nselected notes from his diary during the period of manned space-travel and the first \nmoon landing - identifies a form of dividuation as constituting the implicit but most \nimportant aspect of modern space travel. \n\u201eFor the first time \u2013 and this is a historical development of a new kind \u2013 the \nearth, standing in front of a mirror, has become reflexive, has gained self-\nconsciousness or at least self-recognition.  Since it saw itself from the outside, as \nan object, as it would appear to someone from afar, this first act of self-\nrecognition found the thing perceived as utterly alien.\u201f (Anders, 1970\/1994: 90). \n 27 \nThe interpretation Anders offers, which follows Lacan\u201fs description of the mirror-\nstage in early childhood, sees space travel as triggering the formation of collective \nidentity within human kind (16).  The earth gains self-consciousness by seeing itself \nfrom the outside, as an object.  Within the images broadcast and published, human \nkind \u2013 after initial bewilderment \u2013 recognizes itself.  The moon (as a separate place to \nstand) provides the mirror for the reflection of the image of the earth.  In a more \nspecific sense, with Anders we can envisage individuation, the birth of the individual, \nthe development of the subject, as originating from an object. Or, more precisely, \nfrom the image of the subject as seen from the outside, from somewhere or something \nthat is not the subject. \n \nReturning to the Grand Seaside we can, once more, draw on Anders\u201f interpretation to \nidentify the image of The Guest as constitutive of a process of dividuation which \ncreates The Grand Seaside Family. The Guest encourages staff, management, and \ncustomers to reflect upon themselves, to look upon themselves from the outside, so to \nspeak. Members of the Grand Seaside Family recognize within The Guest their own \nimage. When evoking The Guest, they also evoke their own desires, their own habits, \ntheir own values. After all, it is them who have gradually constituted this image, who \nhave \u2013 in an act of Promethean creation \u2013 made this Phantom. But The Guest is \ndemanding, since it reflects members of the family as they want to be \u201eseen\u201f.  The \nGuest has been ascribed all those features that management, staff, and guest would \ndisplay in an ideal world of customer service.  In that respect, The Guest is less a \nmirror-image than a perfect golem, a creature born out of management\u201fs imagination. \nThe Guest is always raising new demands to be met; it requires continual attention; it \nis omnipresent and constantly expects higher levels of customer satisfaction and \n 28 \nservice quality.  The Guest seems to \u201eincarnate\u201f desires that are insatiable and \ndemands that are unlimited. The cry, \u201eIt\u201fs not enough!\u201f, produces a situation in which \nthe ambiguity of what The Guest wants leads to endless and fruitless attempts at \nsatisfaction that are always doomed to fail. In this sense, the very idea of service \nexcellence appears like a form of (organizational) sublimation that directs \norganizational members towards a compulsive game; a game that implies the \nrecurrent invention of new demands and the endless failure to exceed them (see \nMunro 1995). \n \nWe will not speculate about the psychoanalytic interpretation of (imaginary) objects \nany further (17), but we have perhaps gained a sense of the possible relevance of such \n(mirror-) objects in the process of identity formation. The Guest has a double role to \nplay. Firstly, it overwhelms us with its perfection and as such it is an icon, an ideal \nshaped by the management imaginary, as it reflects the limitless demands of capital.  \nBut it also raises the voice of authority, simultaneously asking members of the Grand \nSeaside family to achieve the impossible and to understand the impossibility of \nachievement. The Guest brings members of the Grand Seaside family together by \npresenting them with an image of what they \u201eshould\u201f be like. The Guest offers a \ngrounding for a sense of identity, inviting members to play the role of a hero in the \norganizational saga that sustains the family. But, crucially, it is precisely the \nindeterminacy and elusiveness of this image that grants it its \u201eseductive\u201f power.  Here, \nAnders meets \u2013 actually anticipates \u2013 Baudrillard. \n\u201eIt [the object] is not divided with itself \u2013 which is the destiny of the subject \u2013 \nand it knows nothing of the mirror phase, where it would come to be caught by \nits own imaginary. It is the mirror. It is that which returns the subject to its \n 29 \nmortal transparency.  So if it can fascinate or seduce the subject, it is because it \nradiates no substance or meaning of its own\u201f (Baudrillard 1983\/1999: 114f). \n \nThe Revenge of The Guest \n  \nThis paper began with some vignettes from a much larger piece of ethnographic work. \nUsing them as speculative inspiration, we have argued that The Guest is an imaginary \nobject that incarnates the principles of service excellence and that is recurrently \ninvoked to steer the conduct of service encounters and to reward or sanction staff for \ntheir performance. This is the imaginary addressee of the Accor Hotels \u201eGuest \nNomination Card\u201f that we used as our epigraph. Employing some ideas from G\u00fcnther \nAnders we have identified the imaginary object as being a Phantom.  The image of \nThe Guest is neither real nor entirely fictitious.  It has assumed a sense of ontological \nand social authority, even supremacy, and has blurred and perhaps even reversed the \norder of simulation and actual conduct. The Guest is thus the icon of a new \norganizational Platonism that inverts creator and created, subject and object, and that \nde-materializes organizing. The seductive power of the imaginary object derives from \nits aura of perfection and elusiveness.  It is precisely its indeterminacy, the fact that it \nprojects limitless and insatiable wants, that gives it its power over staff, management \nand \u201ereal\u201f guests. Caught in its mirror, the subjects of the Grand Seaside find \nthemselves, both individually and collectively as projections of The Guest. The object \nhas become subject, and we have become objects. \n \nWhilst Anders\u201f work can be compared to that of critical theorists such as Foucault or \nBaudrillard, we think there is something else here that deserves to be brought to the \n 30 \nattention of marketing theorists. Much of the emphasis on the fundamental \nrelationality of service encounters is entirely justified, particularly since it then \nembeds questions of satisfaction and exceptionality in a social context (Arnould & \nPrice, 1993). However, such a reframing still stays within a largely humanist, or \nsocial constructionist, account of agency and subjectivity. But what if the results of \nsuch a relationality were systems and structures that constrain agency and shape \nsubjectivity? Both Foucault and Baudrillard provide us with a sense in which \npractices of surveillance and simulation can become ends in themselves, but Anders \ngoes further. He suggests that there is a sort of teleology here, a movement towards \nhumans being dominated by their creations. Yet, unlike the Sorcerer\u201fs Apprentice or \nDr Frankenstein, here the creations are ideas, not things. W. I. Thomas famously said \nthat \u201eIf men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences\u201f. This is the \nhumanist view. For Anders, the consequences, the objects, are now defining what it \nmeans to be human. This is because the very emptiness of human beings makes us \nceaselessly produce a world that dominates us. \n \nThe implications of this diagnosis are profound. We could ask whether we have really \nbecome slaves to our creations, be they assembly lines, computers, or images? \nParadoxically, individual creativity, ingenuity, and imagination are often said to be \nkey to service and knowledge economies, but (following Anders) what if this is just \nanother form of object-domination? The attempt to colonise the imagination in the \nname of service excellence, quality or whatever, appears not to result in liberty, but \nthe subtle shaping of individuals\u201f identity and their possibility of community. After \nall, only those members of the Grand Seaside Family who perform well are good \nmembers. Both identity and community are only possible if The Guest permits, if The \n 31 \nGuest\u201fs demands are translated into individual and collective conduct. So this sort of \ncollective identity is provisional and contingent upon the expressed dedication to and \nthe demonstrated mastery of a particular practice, in this case \u201eservice excellence\u201f for \ncustomers, patients, citizens, students and so on (Munro, 1999). Anders\u201f philosophical \nanthropology suggests a paradox. The more that an empty species like ours \nexternalises itself, the more it becomes emptied of self, and subjected to corporate \nfantasy. \n \nFor Anders this is a state of alienation, an estrangement from being. In marketing \ntheory terms, it moves us from a social constructionist view of service encounters, to a \ncritical theory of the subjects and objects produced by encounters within consumer \ncapitalism. Anders shares with Foucault and Baudrillard a bleak view of industrial \nsociety. However, though he is sceptical about an easy liberation from our object-\nworld - from TV images, atomic-bombs, and branding - he is not despairing. His life-\nlong political engagement in the anti-nuclear and peace movements were not \npredicated upon resignation.  Anders certainly denounces our desire to desert into the \ncamp of objects; our relentless yet fruitless attempts to denying mortality through \nindustrial reincarnation; our shame about being incomplete, impure, imperfect; and \nour compliance with the world we have created. But this does not mean that we \nshould simply renounce our own agency in these matters. Anders, the stubborn \nactivist, espoused an obstinate credo \u201eIf I am desperate; why should it bother me?\u201f  He \nreminds us that: \n\u201eIt is not enough to change the world.  That, we do anyway.  And most of the \ntime it happens without our direct intervention.  We also have to interpret these \nchanges.  In order to change them. In order that the world does not change \n 32 \nwithout us.  And eventually turns into a world without us\u201f (Anders, 1980\/2002: \n5). \nPerhaps it is an increased awareness, a sense of responsibility for our objects \u2013 be they \nmaterial or imaginary \u2013 that Anders is calling for. Most of the time The Guest is not \nvisible to us. We only see its traces in the smile at the reception desk and in the \ncarefully folded bedsheets in our room. All too often, we mistake these signs for signs \nof ourselves, and not of the dominance of the discourse of \u201eservice excellence\u201f as a \ncorporate colonization of fantasy. Anders wants to remind us that we, customers or \nworkers, are not the same kind of beings as The Guest. Further, The Guest is a \ndangerous object because we begin to mistake its demands for our own. Our fantasies, \nour demands for the unexpected, become reduced to customer service management, \nand the impossibility of expecting the unexpected. Perhaps we should make The \nGuest less welcome. \n \nEndnotes \n \n(1) An earlier version of this paper by the first author was presented within theme 43 \n(The power of objects in shaping workplace practices) of the 2004 EGOS Colloquium \nin Ljubljana, Slovenia.  Many thanks to the participants \u2013 in particular to Silvia \nGheradhi \u2013 for their helpful comments. Grateful thanks also to this journal\u201fs referees \nand editors. \n(2) During the fourteen-month research period, the first author conducted formal and \ninformal interviews with management and staff in the hotel and worked together with, \nor followed, managers in the conduct of their daily routines. He also regularly \nattended formal meetings, training courses run as part of the hotel\u201fs customer service \n 33 \nprogramme, and several social events.  Most relevant for the context of this paper, he \nobserved regular management meetings, \u201eThe Morning Briefings\u201f, and recorded \nobservation notes of thirty-seven of these meetings.  These notes were subsequently \ncoded and entered into a NUD-IST database. \n(3) During the restructuring, several parts of the hotel business were outsourced or \nsubcontracted.  Other departments were merged and the restaurants were reorganized \ninto profit centers.  Most managers, if not made redundant, found themselves in \nunfamiliar situations, often having to cope with increased levels of responsibility and \nwork intensity.  The restructuring was also accompanied by the dismissal of numerous \nstaff, which induced an atmosphere of underlying anxiety and distrust among \nemployees. All the details of the study are pseudonyms, but see Bunzel (2000) for full \ndetails. \n(4) Of course, such nominations were a double-edged sword. For a discussion of peer-\nsurveillance and Panopticism at the Grand Seaside see Bunzel et al. (2002). \n(5) All translations from Anders are by the first author. \n(6) To our knowledge, the only systematic discussion of Anders\u201f thought that is \navailable in English is van Dijk (2000). \n(7) He changed his name to Anders after being told by the editor of a Berlin \nnewspaper that he must change his name because there were already too many people \ncalled Stern on his staff. Anders responded by saying \u201ethen call me \u201edifferent\u201f \n(anders). \n(8) Anders plays here with the connotation of the German word Vorbild (literally: \npre-image), translated as \u201eideal\u201f, but that effectively precedes the actual enactment. \n(9) Anders uses the German word Matrize; a term that does not easily lend itself to \ntranslation and that carries the connotation of a form that is both shaped and capable \n 34 \nof shaping.  Perhaps the term corresponds most closely to the English \u201emould\u201f or \n\u201ematrix\u201f. \n(10) This is not always the case.  There were instances when such claims were \nrejected. The grounds for these rejections are outside the scope of this paper and are \ndiscussed in Bunzel et. al. (2002). \n(11) For a Sadistic twist on this idea, see Fitchett (2004). \n(12) For a more comprehensive discussion of legitimate and illegitimate needs and \nwants see Bunzel et al. 2002. \n(13) Though not all three groups in the same way, and with the same consequences. \n(14) \u00dcberschwellig is a neologism which means the opposite of unterschwellig, or \nsubliminal. That is to say, something that fills the senses. \n(15) In the case of Prometheus, his creation was mankind. \n(16) In Glance from the Moon (see page 102 ff.), Anders establishes this process of \nindividuation based on his interpretation of Freud (particularly Totem and Taboo).  \nHowever, his overall argument that space-travel (the moon) represents the mirror-\nstage of humanity clearly derives from Lacan. \n(17) For that you might want to refer to Anders (1970\/1994) or Baudrillard \n(1983\/1999). \n \nReferences \n \nAlba, J.W. & Hutchinson, W.
