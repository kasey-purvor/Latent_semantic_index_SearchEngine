Introduction\nIn the last decade or so, foreign investors\u2019 interest in the emerging Indian equity market has\nbeen growing because of the continuation of the economic liberalisation process and impressive\nperformance of the Indian economy. India\u2019s economic growth has been fuelled by strong macro-\neconomic outcomes, improving infrastructure, growing outsourcing activities by western\ncompanies in India and increasing consumption appetite of India\u2019s fast-growing, large middle\nclass population. The surge in the level of foreign investors\u2019 interest in more recent past is\nlargely attributed to the consistent GDP growth of around 8.5 percent. According to latest\nestimates, India\u2019s GDP has exceeded the US$ one trillion mark and in terms of growth, it is the\nsecond fastest growing economy in the world after China (Adhikari, 2007). Further, India\u2019s\ncompetitive position in the Switzerland based International Institute of Management\nDevelopment (IIMD) ranking has also remarkably improved by ten places to 29th position in\n2006 from 39th in 2005. These rankings of IIMD are based on 312 criteria, which include\ngovernment efficiency, business efficiency, infrastructure, and economic performance (Chaze,\n2006). Thus, as a result of excellent economic growth coupled with further easing of foreign\ninvestment regulations and the impressive performance of the Indian stock market since 2001,\nforeign portfolio investments have been increasing and had reached a record level of US$49\nbillion by the end of December 2006.\nThe growth in foreign equity portfolio investments in emerging markets like India has\nsignificant implications. Historically, one of the main motivations for investing in emerging\nmarkets like India was significant diversification benefits it offered to international investors\nbecause it was viewed as a segmented market (Chatrath et al., 1996). However, if the present\nmagnitude and pace of foreign investments are sustained over time then emerging markets like\nIndia may not remain segmented. This will not only reduce international portfolio diversification\nbenefits but will also make the Indian market more vulnerable to the global shocks. There is\nevidence which suggests that foreign investors have short-term investment interest and at the\nsign of slightest trouble, the foreign capital tends to leave at a much greater pace than the pace at\nwhich it arrives in emerging markets (Bekaert, Harvey and Lumsdaine, 2002). Further, the\nmassive losses experienced by investors following the sub-prime crisis since August 2007 makes\nit all the more critical that the globalisation paradigm is re-examined using a case study of India\nsince it is one of the few emerging markets at the forefront of the global economic growth. Thus\nit is both topical as well as critical for academics and policy makers to have a greater\nunderstanding of the role and influence of foreign investors\u2019 activities. This paper addresses this\nkey issue by providing empirical evidence on the impact of foreign portfolio flows on the short-\nrun and long-run behaviour of the Indian stock market.\nThere is extant literature that has shown that equity markets around the world have become\nmore integrated and globally, stock price movements show greater degree of comovements (see\nfor example, Hamao et al., 1990, Becker et al 1990, Lin et al.1994, Lognin and Solnik, 2001,\nHsin, 2004, Chelley-Steeley, 2005, and Syriopoulos, 2007). One of the common conclusions of\nthe aforementioned studies is that the US and UK stock markets lead market comovements\nbecause they transmit shocks not only to their developed counterparts but also to the emerging\nequity markets in developing countries. Dungey et al. (2004) reports that equity markets in\nAustralia are affected by shocks common to all other markets around the world. They find that\n2the US market plays a significant role in explaining the Australian equity market\u2019s movement\nand Australia\u2019s domestic output has a very small impact on its own equity market which seems\nto diminish in the long run. Richards (2005) finds similar and conclude that foreign investors and\nconditions external to the local markets have impact greater than those reported in the earlier\nstudies. In another study involving stock markets of the US, Europe, and Asia-Pacific region,\nHsin (2004) reports evidence consistent with previous findings of strong linkages and\ntransmission effects among the regional participants in Europe, such as Germany, Britain and\nFrance and Asia-Pacific markets of Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. On the other\nhand, Soydemir (2000) investigates the pattern of comovements between developed and\nemerging market economies using economic fundamentals and trade linkages. He concludes that\nMexico and USA show stronger linkages whereas Argentina and Brazil reveal a weaker\nassociation and attributes this variation to trade flow differences. However, Soydemir does not\nexamine the direct influence of trading activities of foreign investors.\nThus there is little or no research that empirically examines the impact that foreign investors\nare exerting on the integration of emerging equity markets since Errunza (2001) suggests that an\nincrease in foreign investment augments market integration further supplementing information to\nexplain equity market integration. Further, Bekaert et al. (2002) have shown that consistent with\nthe price pressure hypothesis, information incorporated in foreign equity flows increases\nemerging market returns. In another related study on the long run equilibrium relationship\namongst four central European emerging markets and developed markets of Germany and the\nUK, Syriopoulos (2007) conjunctures that increase in inflow of foreign portfolio investments\nmay have been a significant factor for the observed long run equilibrium relationship amongst\nemerging and developed markets. However, he does not explicitly examine this relationship.\nSimilarly, though Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2003) have investigated the impact of foreign\nportfolio and direct investments on financial integration for a sample of industrialized countries,\nthere are relatively fewer studies involving emerging markets and even fewer on the emerging\nIndian equity market. For example, Sharma (2003) investigates the impact of foreign investment\non India\u2019s export performance and finds that foreign investment does not statistically affect the\nexport performance. Lamba (2005) using data from July 1997 to December 2003 reports that the\nIndian market is becoming increasingly influenced by the US and UK equity markets and their\nimpact have been persistent since the September 11 attack in the US. However, research that\ninvestigates the direct influence of trading activities of foreign investors on the integration of the\nemerging Indian equity market with global equity market is lacking.\nThis paper fulfils an important gap in the literature by examining the influence of foreign\nportfolio investments in explaining the short and long-run relationship of the emerging Indian\nequity market with global equity markets. Using daily return series and net foreign portfolio\ninvestments data, we find that the growing trading activities of foreign investors contain\nsignificant information in explaining short-run dynamics and long-run comovements. We\nconclude that the rapid growth in the flow of foreign equity portfolio investments is leading to\ngreater integration of the Indian equity market with global markets. Analysis of the short-term\ndynamics suggests that in future, the Indian market may become more vulnerable to global\n3shocks and, as a consequence, changes in global economic conditions and\/or events may have a\ndestabilizing effect on the Indian equity market.1\nThe paper is organized as follows. The following section provides the data and methodology.\nSection 3 documents empirical findings, and Section 4 concludes the paper.\n2. Data and Methodology\n2.1 Data\nThe significant increase in foreign investments has followed an impressive economic growth\nand performance of the Indian economy (see, Panel A of Table 1). The, most notable fact is that\nmore than half of the investment, approximately US$28 billion has been received in 2004 and\n2005. The Mumbai Stock Exchange, which is considered as the barometer of the stock markets\nin India has shown significant increase in capitalisation and turnover (see, Panel B of Table 1).\nThis is also reflected in the strong performance of the Indian equity market. In particular,\nsignificant growth in the Indian stock market has occurred since 2004. Also, the MSCI Indian\nindex has outperformed the MSCI World index which represents 23 developed markets (see\nFigure 1).\nInsert Table 1 here\nInsert Figure 1 here\nWe use daily data in our analysis for a sample period of six years beginning 1 January 2001\nto 15 January 2007. Daily returns are calculated from the MSCI Indian index denominated in\nUS$ and the MSCI world total return index which is a composite index of 23 developed markets.\nSince Net Foreign Equity Investment (NFEI) data represents total of foreign portfolio\ninvestments from all countries, we use MSCI world index as proxy for global equity returns. The\nMSCI indexes have been obtained from DataStream International. Net daily foreign equity\nportfolio investment data is obtained from the Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) as\navailable on the CNBC\u2019s Moneycontrol.com website. We split the total sample into two sub-\nperiods because the trading activities of foreign institutional investors in the Indian equity market\nhave substantially increased since early 2004.2 This is evident from Figure 2 which shows a\n1 In hindsight, this has turned out be true. At the time of writing, the Indian equity markets had been extremely volatile and as result of large\nscale withdrawal of investments by foreign institutional investors following the sub-prime crisis, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)\nSensex index suffered biggest weekly fall in 18 years on October 12, 2008.\n2 We also test for any structural break in the series of cumulative NFEI. One of the most appropriate tests for\nidentifying the structural break in the single series is the unit root test developed by Zivot and Andrews (1992).\nTheir unit root test involves three different models, the first allows one time change in level (intercept) of the\nseries, the second, allows for a one time change in the slope of the series and finally the third combines changes\nin the level and the slope of the trend function (see, Zivot and Andrews, 1992 for more details). Since our\nobjective is to test the structural break in the mean value (intercept), we test for the structural break using the\nfirst model and identify the date for structural break as 17 May 2004. As such, our selection of sub samples also\njustifies Zivot and Andrews\u2019 structural break test. We would like to thank the anonymous referee for this\nvaluable comment.\n4significant rise in the net daily foreign equity investment from 2004 onwards. The average daily\nnet foreign equity investment rose to US$34.29 millions during the period 2004-07 from\nUS$13.26 millions for the period 2001-03.\nInsert Figure 2 here\n2.2 Methodology\nWe take a non-structural approach for investigating the impact of foreign investment on the\nshort and long-run dynamics of Indian equity market with the global markets. Use of a non-\nstructural approach is advocated by Bekaert and Harvey (2000) who suggest that due to lack of\ntheoretical basis, non-structural approach should be preferred in conducting portfolio flow\nstudies.3\n2.2.1 Cointegration\nWe examine the long-run relationship between Indian and global equity markets using VAR\nanalysis proposed by Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990). We follow Johansen-\nJuselius (JJ) because their approach is considered superior to the regression-based approach\nsuggested by Engle and Granger in 1987 (Cheung and Lai, 1993)4. Another reason for using the\nJJ approach is that it utilizes the maximum likelihood estimates and allows testing and estimation\nof more than one cointegrating vector in the multivariate system without requiring a specific\nvariable to be normalized. This way, the JJ tests overcome the problem of carrying over the\nerrors from the first step into the second step commonly encountered in Engle and Granger\u2019s\n(1987) approach to cointegration. Further, Johansen\u2019s method is independent of the choice of the\nendogenous variable within a vector autoregression (VAR) framework.\nThe general VAR equation can be rewritten as,\n\uf0e5\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf02d\n\uf02b\uf02b\uf044\uf047\uf02b\uf050\uf03d\uf044\n1\n1\n1\np\ni\nttititt Bxyyy \uf065\n(1)\nWhere:\n\uf0e5\n\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf050\np\ni\ni IA\n1\n, and (2)\n\uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf03d\uf047\np\nij\nji A\n1\n(3)\n3 A non structural approach is also supported by Tesar and Werner (1995) who find that even in the relatively\nopen markets, the substantial increase in cross-border flows do not comply with theoretical foundations of optimal\nportfolio theory due to home bias effects.\n4 The Johansen-Juselius procedure resolves the problem of endogeneity in that we do not need to normalise the\ncointegrating vector on one of the variables as required in the Engle and Granger (EG) test.\n5Since our objective is to investigate the long-run relationship, we will focus on the elements of\nmatrix \uf050. If vector y contains m variables, matrix \uf050 will be of the order m x m, with a maximum\npossible rank of m (or full rank). Equation (1), except for the \uf050yt-k term, is in the form of the\ntraditional VAR with first difference. The \uf050 term determines whether the system of equations is\ncointegrated, i.e., whether a long-run equilibrium relationship exists. The feature to note is that\nthe rank of matrix \uf050 is equal to the number of independent cointegrating vectors. If rank of\nmatrix \uf050 = 0, the matrix is null, i.e., all the elements in this matrix are zero, which implies no\ncointegration and the error correction mechanism, \uf050yt-k, therefore, does not exist. In determining\nthe rank of matrix \uf050 (number of cointegrating vectors), we calculate the characteristic roots or\neigenvalues, i\uf06c\u02c6 of \uf050. Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) propose trace (\uf06ctrace) and\nmaximum eigenvalue (\uf06cmax) test statistics to establish whether the characteristic roots are\nsignificantly different from zero. The likelihood ratio statistic for the trace test (\uf06ctrace) is:\n\uf028 \uf029\uf0e5\n\uf02b\uf03d\n\uf02d\uf02d\uf03d\nm\nri\nitrace Tr\n1\n\u02c61ln)( \uf06c\uf06c (4)\nWhere i\uf06c\u02c6 = the estimated values of the characteristic roots (also known as\neigenvalues) obtained from the estimated \uf050 matrix. The null hypothesis to be tested is that the\nnumber of cointegrating vectors is less than or equal to r against the alternative hypothesis that\nthe number of cointegrating vectors is more than r. For example the null hypothesis r \uf0a3 0 against\nalternative r = 1, r \uf0a3 1 against alternative r = 2, and so forth. The computed values of \uf06ctrace\nstatistics are evaluated using the critical values provided by Osterwarld-Lenum (1992). The\noptimal system lag length is determined by using the Schwarz Information Criteria (SIC).\nSpecifically, the appropriate number of lags for each variable is obtained by computing the SIC\nover different lag schemes in the range from 1 to 20 and by choosing the number of lags that\nyields the lowest value for the SIC.\n2.2.2 Error Correction Representations\nIn cases where we find cointegration, we employ the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM).\nVECM provides an effective way for analysing the speed with which the error is corrected in the\nobserved long-run relationship. If variables are cointegrated, they converge in the long run\ndespite showing deviations in the short run. VECM examines this equilibrium relationship and\nshows the feedback mechanism via the error correction term. VECM also provides a mechanism\nto identify the magnitude and length of information being transmitted from one series to another\nthrough the system, referred as the Variance Decomposition (VD) and the Impulse Response\nFunction (IRF) respectively. The VECM is employed on first difference of I(1) variables as\nshown below.\nitt xy \uf02d\uf02d \uf044\uf03d\uf044 11 \uf062 + itw \uf02d\uf0442\uf062 + 13 \uf02dtz\uf062 + t\uf06d (5)\nThe above is a three variables model with y and x being return series and w being the\ncumulative net equity investment series. The cointegrating vector zt-1 is the error correction term\nwhich will be I (0) if the series in their level form have long-run relationship. This term corrects\n6the short-run deviations and facilitates long-run convergence. 3\uf062 measures the speed of\nadjustment of the short term deviations back into long run equilibrium. The other two\ncoefficients ( 1\uf062 , 2\uf062 ) exhibit short-run relationship.\n2.2.2.1 Granger Causality\nThe short-run dynamics are examined using the Granger causality between the endogenous\nvariables in the following way:\nRy,t = a + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b2i Ry,t-i + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b3i Rx,t-i + \u03b5 t (6)\nRx,t = a + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b4i R x,t-i + \uf0e5\n\uf03d\nn\ni 1\n\u03b6i Ry,t-\u03b9 + u t (7)\nWhere Ry,t and Rx,t are the returns of index y and x at time t accordingly.\nIn the above regressions we examine whether the coefficients \u03b3i and \u03b6i are equal to zero using\nthe standard F test. If \u03b3i, and \u03b6i coefficients are different from zero then we conclude that there is a\nbi-directional causality between and Ry,t and Rx,t. Alternatively, if both coefficients are found to\nbe equal to zero, then we conclude that there is no causality. Finally, in equation (6) Ry,t Granger\ncauses Rx,t if \u03b3i =0 for i=1,2,\u2026n. Similarly, in (7) causality implies that Rx,t Granger causes Ry,t ,\nprovided that \u03b6i \uf0b9 0 for i=1,2,\u2026n. Our test uses daily foreign equity investment data to test the\ncausality with returns.\n2.2.2.2 Impulse Response Function\nImpulse Response Function (IRF) explains how a unit shock in one variable in isolation of the\nothers, affects the movement in other variables. In each of the equation one unit shock is applied\nto detect changes in the VAR system over time by representing the VAR as VMA (Vector\nMoving Average):\ntRi, = 011b ti ,\uf065 +\n1\n11b 1,1 \uf02dt\uf065 +\n1\n12b 1,2 \uf02dt\uf065 +\u2026\u2026.. (8)\nWhere, bij are unit normalized innovation coefficients of impulse response function following\nthe normalization by the Cholesky factor (see Diebold, 2004) and 011b is the simultaneous effect\nof a unit shock to ti ,\uf065 . The contemporaneous innovation is stated in standard deviation form and\nhave non-unit coefficient in contrast to its unit coefficient in equation.\n2.2.2.3 Variance Decomposition\nPrevious research has shown that variance decomposition analysis is an effective way to\nexamine the dynamic interactions amongst economic time series (Sims, 1980). Whilst impulse\nresponse function traces the effects of shocks amongst the endogenous variables, variance\ndecomposition enables further analysis by separating the h-step error variations. The variance\ndecomposition thus offers greater insights about the relative significance of each random\n7innovation that affects the variables in VAR. Decomposing the variance offers slightly different\nperspective on the relationship of the identified variables since it shows what proportion of the\nvariance is due to a shock in its own lags against the shocks in other variables. A shock to\nvariable i will not only affect its own future outcomes but will also be transmitted to other\nvariables.\n3. Empirical Results\nThe descriptive statistics for the whole sample as well as two sub-periods are given in Table\n2. Average daily returns from the Indian equity market (0.097) are significantly higher than the\nMSCI world equity index (0.024) for the full sample period. The average returns are also higher\nfor the two sub-periods. However, higher returns from the Indian market are associated with\nhigher volatility. The standard deviation for the Indian market returns is higher (1.430) as\ncompared to the standard deviation of global equity market returns (0.863) for the full sample\nperiod. We will expect the volatility to be higher in the second sub-period given that the previous\nliterature has shown that foreign portfolio investments tend to be volatile. Our findings confirm\nthis as the reported standard deviation for second sub-period (1.498) is higher than the standard\ndeviation in the first sub-period (1.357). The average Net Foreign Equity Investment (NFEI)\naverage is substantially higher in the second sub-period rising by over 150%.\nInsert Table 2 here\n3.1 Long Run Relationship\nThe Augmented Dickey-Fuller Statistics presented in Table 3 confirm that all series in their\nlevel form are non-stationery since the ADF statistics are not statistically significant. However,\nthe series in their first difference are stationery with I(0). The JJ cointegration model (equation 1)\nis then applied on the log of the level series for the sub sample periods. The findings are\npresented in Table 4. Panel A reports results of cointegration analysis involving the Indian and\nWorld indexes for the first sub-period (2001-2003). Figures in Panel A show that both Trace as\nwell as the Eigenvalue statistics are lower than their critical values suggesting lack of a long term\nrelationship between the Indian and the world equity markets. However for the second sample\nperiod, the Trace and Eigenvalue statistics are highly significant confirming that at least one\ncointegrating vector exists. The results are consistent with the increased foreign investment\nactivity in the second sub-period, 2004-2007. This is further corroborated by the results\npresented in Panel C and Panel E where we find that by including NFEI series in the\ncointegration analysis at least one cointegrating vector is found for the first sample period and at\nleast two cointegrating vectors are found in the second sample period. However, presence of a\ncointegrating vector in the first sample period (Panel C) is attributed to long-run equilibrium\nrelationship between the world equity markets and portfolio investments as reported in Panel D.\nThus identification of an additional cointegrating vector in the second sample period (Panel E)\nsuggests that increasing trading activity of foreign investors (NFEI) appears to be playing a role\nin the integration of the Indian equity market with the global equity markets. Consistent with the\nevidence reported in the previous literature, we find that that the Indian equity market shows\ngreater degree of integration in the second sub-period when the foreign portfolio investments\nwere significantly higher. The growing global integration will make the Indian market more\n8susceptible to global shocks, as has been witnessed by significant losses suffered by investors in\nthe Indian market following sub-prime crisis.\nInsert Table 3 here\nInsert Table 4 here\n3.2 VEC Estimation\nSince as expected, cointegrating relationships are found only in the second sample, the error\ncorrection model is employed on the first differenced data for sub-period 2004-2007. The error\ncorrection model is employed for three primary purposes. The first is to detect the causality\nrunning from one series to another through the system, second is to analyze the speed of\nadjustment, and the final one is to detect the magnitude and length of the impact of shocks in one\nvariable as a consequence of the shocks in another variable. Results of the VEC estimations are\nreported in Tables 5 & 6. The findings show that world market returns not only influence NFEI\nbut also equity returns from the Indian market. This is consistent with the existing literature\nwhich reports that the developed markets transmit information to other markets (Dungey 2004).\nThe significant Error Correction Term (ECT) statistic of -8.73 indicates that response from the\ndeveloped market adjusts to the deviations observed in the equilibrium relationship with the\nIndian equity markets as reported in Table 4. The F-test statistic for NFEI is also statistically\nsignificant and confirms that foreign investors play a significant part in explaining Indian equity\nmarket returns. This is consistent with findings reported by Richards (2005) for other Asian\nemerging markets. The statistically significant ECM results further support the evidence of\ncointegration results reported earlier.\nInsert Table 5 here\n3.2.1 Variance Decomposition\nVariance decomposition helps in investigating the short-run magnitude of shocks transmitted\nthrough the system. We use a three variables future error variance decomposition analysis to\ndetect the short-run dynamics. The ordering of the series is based on the market value of series in\nUS$ terms and therefore it stands as World, India and NFEI. The innovation account analysis is\npresented for day 1, day 5 to day 40. We expect that with greater levels of foreign portfolio\ninvestments, we will find greater transmission of shocks from global markets to Indian markets.\nResults in Table 6 show that the forecast variance of world equity market returns is mainly\nexplained by the shocks in its own variance and by innovations in the Indian market. Innovations\nin NFEI has relatively little impact. On the other hand, we find that innovations in variance of\nworld equity returns significantly account for the future error variance in Indian returns and its\ninfluence increases with increase in number of lags. As expected, the Indian market is\nsignificantly influenced by the information and shocks arising in the global equity markets. The\ninnovations in the variance of NFEI have relatively smaller influence on the forecast variance of\nIndian market returns. Finally, in case of NFEI, innovations in variance are mainly explained by\nits own previous shocks.\nInsert Table 6 here\n93.2.2 Impulse Response Function\nThe impulse response function (IRF) aids in examining the responsiveness of a variable to\none unit of standard deviation innovation in another variable. If the response is permanent then\nthe impact reverts back in the equilibrium system but if it\u2019s just transitory, then the effect fades\naway quickly. Figure 3, provides IRF for innovations in world equity returns. Once again, as\nbefore, we expect that Indian equity markets will show greater responsiveness to global\ninformation following the increased global integration of the Indian market. The result shows\nthat the response of returns in the world equity markets is primarily explained by its own shocks\nwith a very short time horizon. There is some evidence of information being transmitted from the\nIndian market to the world markets for a couple days, however the effect is short lived. The\neffect of NFEI on world equity markets returns is negligible. The response in the Indian market\nto innovations in global market returns, as reported in Figure 4 shows that Indian market returns\nsignificantly respond to innovations in global equity market returns. Although the impact is short\nterm, it seems to have a permanent effect lending support to the reported equilibrium relationship\nin Table 4. Further, the Indian equity market returns also respond to innovations in NFEIs\nsuggesting the growing influence of foreign investors. The innovations in NFEI in Figure 5 show\nthat NFEI responds instantaneously to the innovations in world and Indian returns. More\nsignificantly, NFEI tends to react more to its own innovations confirming the positive feedback\neffects in investment activities of foreign institutional investors documented by previous research\n(see, Froot, et al., 2001).\nInsert Fig 3 here\nInsert Fig 4 here\nInsert Fig 5 here\n4. Conclusions\nA significant increase in foreign portfolio investments in emerging markets in general in\nIndian equity markets in particular is a matter of concern to the policy makers in developing\ncountries. Indian stock market\u2019s excellent performance since 2001 together with impressive\neconomic growth and easing of foreign investment regulations economy has attracted significant\nforeign portfolio investments. It is expected that increased foreign portfolio investments will\nincrease the global linkages and, as a consequence, exposing the Indian equity market to become\nmore vulnerable to global shocks.\nThis paper provides empirical evidence of role and the influence of foreign institutional\nportfolio investments in explaining short and long-run behaviour of the emerging Indian equity\nmarket. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides evidence on the\ninfluence of foreign investors in the Indian equity market. Using daily returns from the MSCI\nIndian equity index, MSCI global equity index, and portfolio investments made by foreign\ninstitutional investors and employing a variety of econometric tests, we find that the growing\ntrading activities of foreign investors contain significant information in explaining short-run\ndynamics and long-run comovements of the Indian equity market with global equity markets.\nThe findings of this paper have significant theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically,\n10\nthe significant response of the Indian equity market returns to global shocks suggests that in\npricing Indian assets, an appropriate asset pricing model would need to include global factors.\nPractically, increased global integration of the Indian market would not only reduce\ndiversification benefits but will also make the Indian market more susceptible to global shocks,\nas has been witnessed by significant losses suffered by investors in the Indian market following\nthe sub-prime crisis.\n11\nReferences\nAdhirkari, A (2007).
