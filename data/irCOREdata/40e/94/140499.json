APPENDIX: Note on the Kruskal-Wallis test The Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test is a one-way analysis of variance by ranks to determine whether k independent samples come from different populations. It is a non-parametric equivalent of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The K-W test assumes that the variable being studied has an underlying continuous distribution, therefore any survey instrument should use at least ordinally scaled items. The computation of the K-W test involves the replacement of each of the N observations. For example the lowest score is replaced by rank 1, the second lowest by rank 2 and the highest by rank N. When this has been performed the sum of the ranks in each sample is computed with the K-W test determining whether the sums of ranks are disparate according to a chi-square distribution. About the authors Andrew White Dr. Andrew White is a Fellow in Strategic Innovation at Said Business School, University of Oxford. His research focuses on understanding how organizations can successfully manage innovation, particularly discontinuous innovation. He has published in several international academic and practitioner journals, such as the European Journal of Information Systems and Technovation, and presented at numerous international conferences. He acts as a consultant to a number of global organizations, and has recently co-authored a review of how information technology will create intelligent infrastructure systems over the next few decades for the UK Government\u2019s Department of Trade and Industry. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers & Commerce and has recently been appointed as a Scholar with the Advanced Institute of Management Research, a UK government initiative that22 aims to exemplify how collaborative management research and development can contribute to academic, business, public service and policy audiences.

This understanding is put in the context of the wider literatures on supply\nchain management and the adoption of information systems and technology.\n1INTRODUCTION\nEffective supply chain management is increasingly being seen as a key determinant of an\norganization\u2019s competitive advantage. Unacceptable levels of on-shelf availability in\nretail stores (Fisher, 1997), reports of poor customer service by manufacturers and\nlogistics companies (Lee, 2002) and excessively high inventory levels (Lee and\nBillington, 1992) are all manifestations of less then optimized levels of supply chain\nperformance. This need for improved performance is being exacerbated by the increased\nglobalization of sources of supply, the outsourcing of business processes such as\nmanufacturing and logistics, and the increased service orientation of many manufacturing\norganizations (Feenstra, 1998; Wise and Baumgartner, 1999; Christopher, 2004). These\nfactors, coupled with the estimate that more than 50% of the waste in extended supply\nchain processes occurs between enterprises or beyond the edge of the enterprise (Dominy,\n2003), is causing many to believe that competition can be between supply chains as well\nas individual organizations (Christopher, 1998).\nUntil recently, the role of information systems in improving supply chain management\nwas constrained by geographical and temporal boundaries and by the separation of\nmaterial and information flows across a supply chain (Breu and White, 2004). These\nconstraints inhibited \u201cany where, any time\u201d access to data and applications, and\nprevented human agents within an organization from responding in real time to supply\nchain events (McFarlane and Sheffi, 2003). The separation of physical and information\nassets created what has been termed \u2018dumb\u2019 physical assets (White, et al. 2004). Some\ncommentators have suggested that the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)\ntechnology promises to mitigate this structural deficiency, and hence to improve\nmanagement of the supply chain (Sheffi, 2004). As adoption increases, there is a need to\nbegin to complement this speculation with empirical evidence, and fulfil an important\npart of the research agenda into e-business logistics (Auramo, et al . 2002, Cavinato,\n2005).\nThis paper therefore reports on a survey conducted with 616 European supply chain\nmanagers, and specifically focuses on the experiences of the 128 respondents who are\nearly RFID adopters, exploring the factors that determine successful perceived outcomes.\nThese results contribute to both theory and practice, with the aim of moving the debate\nbeyond some of the hyperbole that surrounds this technology and towards a clearer\nunderstanding of its role in the management of supply chains. First, we will review the\nprevious literature which hypothesizes what this role is.\nIS AND RFID IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN\nThe important role that information systems play in the management of supply chains has\nbeen repeatedly highlighted in the literature. Previous research has indicated, for\nexample, the impact of information systems in increasing the efficiency of supply chains\n(Alkadi et al., 2003), in aligning supply chain strategy and business strategy (Williams et\nal., 1997), and in contributing to overall organizational growth and profitability (Kotha\nand Swamidass, 2000; Byrd and Davidson, 2003). On an operational level, the adoption\nof information systems has been linked to an increase in product offerings and customer\nservice levels (Kincade et al., 2001), and to improved quality and timeliness of\n2production information (Brandyberry et al., 1999), while Kent and Mentzner (2003)\nfound that the extent of trading partners\u2019 technology adoption positively impacted the\nsupply chain relationship between the two parties.\nIn order to consider the potential contribution of RFID to this picture, we will first\ndescribe the technology briefly. The main components of RFID technology are tags and\nreaders: electronic tags which contain memory and an antenna, and readers that can read\nthe data stored on the tag. If a tag is attached to a product, and an Electronic Product\nCode (EPC) - a unique product identifier based on standards developed by the EPCglobal\nNetwork - is stored on it, then the product takes on a unique electronic identity. With\nRFID, physical and information flows can therefore converge to create intelligent\nphysical assets. So no longer are assets such as plasma televisions, pallets or shipping\ncontainers \u201cdumb\u201d, unable to understand who they are or where they are, and lacking the\nability to communicate this information to a third party. Instead, when they pass into (for\nexample) a retail store or distribution centre, they can communicate their identity and\nhistory to the readers located by the loading bays, and hence to the systems into which\nthese readers are integrated.\nRetailers such as Wal-Mart, Metro, Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Carrefour have\nannounced initiatives to use the technology, and some have mandated that their suppliers\nshould use tagged reusable assets for the products that they supply (Sullivan, 2004).\nManufacturing companies such as Airbus have started to use RFID to track spare parts\n(LogicaCMG, 2004), and BMW is tracking cars as they move through the production line\n(Maselli, 2004). Many of the major IT vendors, such as IBM, SAP and Oracle, have\nannounced strategies to adapt existing solutions to exploit RFID, and the technology has\nalso been the focus of attention by national and international bodies, with the EU funding\na number of research projects in this area. When viewed collectively, it is apparent that\nthere are major developments being undertaken by various categories of powerful actors.\nThis is creating an expectation that there will be widespread adoption of this technology,\nand that it will have a noticeable impact on the performance of supply chains.\nFrom a supply chain management and operations perspective, this is a field of research\nand practice where the latter has very much led the former. Extensive literatures exist\nconcerning the technical aspects of RFID technology (e.g. Frisk et al. 2002; Knospe and\nPohl 2004; Rasul 2004; Yagi et al. 2005) but little is known about the current state of\nadoption of RFID technology in a supply chain management context. That which has\nbeen published is largely anecdotal and case based (Angeles 2005; Jones et al, 2004; Ault\n2004; Atkinson 2004). The time seems ripe, therefore, to explore the experience of early\nadopters.\nCONCEPTUAL MODEL\nOur conceptual model is presented as Figure 1. The model considers the case of an\norganization which has made at least initial steps towards RFID adoption, typically\nthrough an RFID trial, and is concerned with factors influencing the perceived success of\nthis adoption. It consists of two key components: factors that determine the outcomes of\nRFID adoption; and the outcomes themselves, which we will consider first.\n3OutcomesCustomer Mandate\nIndustry Sector\nPerceived\nOrganisational\nInnovativeness\nLevel of Integration\nEmbedded vs. slap\n& ship\n(c) Operational Deployment\n(y\/n)\n(a) Anticipated benefits\n(b) Anticipated ROI\nH1\nH2\nH3\nH4\nDetermining Factors\nFigure 1 RFID adoption conceptual model\nThe need for IT investments to generate a return on investment is well established\n(Tiernan and Peppard, 2004). Many researchers also examine the specific benefits that\ncan be attributed to a technology (Lee, 2001; Kearns, 2004). Research from practitioner\norganizations such as consultancies, investment banks and analysts has suggested what\nthese benefits might be in the case of RFID. For example, Accenture (2004) suggests that\nbenefits will come from improved finished goods inventory, production visibility and\nsupply chain planning activities, while analyst Juniper (2005) anticipates benefits\nincluding reduced counterfeiting, process improvements in areas such as track and trace,\nand reduced theft or shrinkage. We therefore include in the conceptual model each of\nROI (labeled (b) in Figure I), anticipated benefits (labeled (a)) and operational\ndeployment (labeled (c)). The use of anticipated as opposed to achieved perceived\nbenefits reflects the early stage of adoption in most organizations. The perceived benefits\nin the model, which are shown as column headings in Table III, have been developed\nfrom extant literature and are presented below.\nThe issuing of mandates by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target means that \u2018many\nof these suppliers have no choice\u2019 but to adopt this technology if they are to win new or\nkeep existing business (Vijayaraman and Osyk, 2006). The structuring of these mandates\nis reported to vary by issuing organisation. For example, The US Department of Defence\nis paying for the costs incurred in complying with the mandate, whereas it is estimated to\ncost Wal-Mart's top 125 vendors $500m to do so (Twist, 2005). Other examples of how\nmandates differ include the type of tag and the type of asset (for example, a pallet or an\nactual product) or stock-keeping unit to be tagged. The second perceived benefit,\nimproved customer service, is linked to the concept of mandates. Parasuraman et al.\n(1984) define customer service as a comparison of customer expectations with the\nperformance of the organization as perceived by the customer. Operations that are\nenabled with RFID may enable suppliers to meet existing and\/or raised expectations of\ncustomers in areas such as baggage handling by airlines (Wyld, et al. 2005) and product\nauthenticity (Jones, et al. 2005).\n4The challenge of holding enough inventories to meet demand, but not incur excess cost,\nis a perennial supply chain management problem (Forrester, 1961; Lee, et al. 1997).\nChow, et al. (2007) found (on a single case study basis) that by applying RFID to a\nsupply chain, along with other enabling technologies, significant reductions in inventory\nlevels (without a corresponding drop in out-of-stocks) were found. Hence the next\nhypothesized benefit of reduced inventory. However, the ability to supply (i.e. holding\ninventory) is not sufficient to fulfill a customer order. The next perceived benefit of\nhaving a faster sales cycle is also necessary (Ellram, et al. 1989). With increased visibility\nof stock enabled by RFID leading to possible availability of it in the right place, we\npostulate that adopting organizations can produce faster sales cycle times (from order to\nfulfillment).\nReducing supply chain costs by applying RFID has been suggested as one of the main\nbenefits of this technology (Attaran, 2007). The types of costs that can be reduced\ninclude: redirecting products originally intended for one location to another; using\nalternative transportation modes; changing the product mix in production; reallocating\nproducts to different supply chains; and using pricing and rebates to affect product\ndemand and product substitution (Lin, et al. 2006). RFID has not just been positioned as a\ntechnology to lower the cost of supply chain operations, though, but also to improve the\nvalue that is produced for customers. Nagumo (2003) identifies a number of prototype\nproducts and services in areas such as healthcare, concierge and road pricing that are\nbeing transformed by the use of RFID. It is arguable that the perceived benefit of higher\nprices being charged could result from this value-adding activity.\nIt seems plausible that any of these perceived benefits of RFID may be order winners or\norder qualifiers: over time those benefits that had been considered winners would be\nexpected to migrate to becoming \u2018hygiene factors\u2019. Therefore, as a further benefits\nmeasure, we add perceived impact on competitive advantage. Finally, we have already\ndiscussed how the management of supply chains has been constrained by geographical\nand temporal boundaries and by the separation of material and information flows across a\nsupply chain (Breu and White, 2004), preventing human agents from responding in real\ntime to supply chain events (McFarlane and Sheffi, 2003). The integration of RFID of\ninformation systems integration, due to one intelligent asset being able to talk to two\ninformation systems within and across organisations, may provide a further benefit to\nsupply chain management.\nOne of the major challenges that adopters of RFID have been faced with is whether or not\ntheir investments in the technology will generate a positive return on investment (Miller,\n2007). This is a critical benefit for adopters of the technology to realise in itself, but also\nif the final type of outcome, that of operational deployment, is to be realized. Given that\ntrialability is a key factor determining the eventual adoption of an innovation (Rogers,\n2003), an adopting organization progressing beyond a trial to where the technology is\ndeployed as part of its everyday operations is a primary indicator as to its perceived\nvalue. Therefore, whether or not RFID has been operationally deployed is the third\noutcome measure in this study.\n5Determining Factors\nCustomer Mandates\nThe optionality or otherwise of an innovation has unsurprisingly been shown to be an\ninstrumental factor in the diffusion of a range of innovations (Rogers, 2003). In the case\nof RFID, several major buyers of both consumer and non-consumer goods have mandated\nthat their major suppliers adopt the technology as a necessary component, or \u201corder\nqualifier\u201d, of their commercial relationship. In the US, these mandating organizations\ninclude Wal-Mart and the Department of Defense (Asif and Mandiwalla, 2005), while in\nthe EU, retailers such as Tesco in the UK and Metro in Germany (Juniper, 2005) have\nannounced similar initiatives. We conceptualize RFID adoption in response to these\nmandates as driven by customer service, which can be defined as a comparison of\ncustomer expectations with the performance of the organization as perceived by the\ncustomer (Parasuraman et al., 1984). Any RFID adoption in response to such a mandate\nmay mean an increase in the cost to serve the mandating customer, and may have limited\nplanned benefits other than maintaining revenue levels derived from current customers,\nwhich may result in a limited expectation of such additional benefits in the future. In\naddition, those responding to the mandate will have less discretion to decide not to\nproceed with full operational deployment of the technology than those whose decision\ndepends on results from the trial alone. The leads to the following set of hypotheses:\nH1a \u2013 Organizations who have adopted RFID technology in response to a mandate from their customers will\nhave lower anticipated benefits than those who have not received a mandate.\nH1b \u2013 Organizations who have adopted RFID technology in response to a mandate from their customers\nwill have a lower anticipated return on investment than those who have not received a mandate.\nH1c \u2013 Responding to a mandate from customers will positively determine whether organizations have\nprogressed beyond a trial to operational deployment of RFID.\nIndustry Sector\nIndustry sectors are known to possess different characteristics such as the bargaining\npower of suppliers and buyers, and barriers to entry (Porter, 1980). In the context of the\nadoption of information technology, factors such as typical organization size, position in\nthe value chain, country of location and IT infrastructure of an industry (Clarke, 1992),\nand the nature of products and how they are purchased (Malone et al. 1987) have all been\nsuggested to be determining factors. Therefore we conceptualize that the industry in\nwhich an organization resides has a determining role in the level of RFID adoption. The\nleads to the following set of hypotheses:\nH2a \u2013 The anticipated benefits derived from adopting RFID technology will be determined by the industry\nsector in which the organization resides.\nH2b \u2013 The anticipated return on investment derived from adopting RFID technology will be determined by\nthe industry sector in which the organization resides.\nH2c \u2013 The decision to adopt RFID operationally will be determined by the industry sector in which the\norganization resides.\n6Perceived Organizational Innovativeness\nThe ability of an organization to assimilate new technology into its operations has been\nshown to be dependent on its innovative capability (Avlonitis et al. 1994; Tang 1999;\nHult et al. 2004). Organizations that possess these capabilities are often referred to as\n\u201cearly adopters\u201d, and are seen as a source of advice and information about innovations\n(Rogers, 2003). In the context of RFID, understanding whether these early adopters are\nderiving greater benefits from the technology is essential in understanding the\ncharacteristics of its diffusion. This rationale suggests the following hypotheses:\nH3a \u2013 The anticipated benefits from adopting RFID technology will be dependent on the perceived\ninnovativeness of the adopting organization.\nH3b \u2013 The anticipated return on investment of RFID technology will be dependent on the perceived\ninnovativeness of the adopting organization.\nH3c \u2013 The decision to adopt RFID operationally will be dependent on the perceived innovativeness of the\nadopting organization.\nLevel of Integration\nThe use of RFID to track individual products, pallets or containers allows data to be\ncollected on such issues as movements across specific geographic boundaries, and when\nand by whom an asset was last serviced. In order to make sense of the data generated by\nthe tags and readers, integration must be in place with the wider enterprise information\nsystems and the business processes that these systems enable. For example, if a tagged\npallet is loaded onto a truck, a RFID reader located on the loading bay could inform both\nthe warehouse management system that the goods have been dispatched, and also the\nfinancial system that a transaction has occurred and that an invoice needs to be issued.\nThis need for integration between different systems is reflected in the wider literature\nconcerning the use of intra- and inter-organizational information systems. Integration of\nsystems with the wider IS infrastructure has been found to affect the return on investment\ngenerated from ERP system implementation (Themistocleous et al. 2001), time-based\nperformance of the supply chain (Jayaram et al. 2000), and the ability of \u201dreal-time\ninformation to travel immediately backwards\u201d so that \u201cinventory flows swiftly forwards\u201d\n(Frohlich, 2002). IS integration can be regarded as encompassing processes, programs\nand data repositories (Yang and Papazoglou, 2000). However, the ease with which this\nintegration can be accomplished should not be underestimated in terms of cost,\nmanagement time and complexity (Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2004). This point suggests\nthat it may be easier to adopt information technologies when their integration into the\nwider information system infrastructure is not an explicit part of this adoption process,\nalthough this approach may not deliver the same degree of benefits.\nThese discussions of IS integration are also apparent in literature to date on RFID\nspecifically. It has been suggested that two principal types of RFID adoption strategy are\nbeing employed (Aberdeen Group, 2004), with a third which is positioned part way\nbetween these two extremes. At one extreme is \u2018slap and ship\u2019, which involves placing an\nRFID tag on an asset and then shipping it to a third party for it to use in its own\ninformation systems. At the other is the integration of RFID with the wider enterprise\nsystems of the adopting organization. This is referred to as \u2018embedded\u2019, and means that\n7data from the tags is being analyzed in supply chain, enterprise resource and CRM\nsystems, and decisions made as a result of this analysis at multiple points of the\norganization. There may be some organizations, for example those serving multiple\nretailers and therefore under multiple mandates, who are using a combination of the two\napproaches. This is referred to as \u2018hybrid\u2019, and could also be due to where the adopting\norganization perceives that an ROI could be generated from the use of the technology\nwith specific products. The leads to the following set of hypotheses:\nH4a \u2013 Organizations employing a slap and ship adoption strategy will have lower anticipated benefits than\nthose integrating the RFID technology with their existing information systems.\nH4b Organizations employing a slap and ship adoption strategy will have lower anticipated return on\ninvestment than those integrating the RFID technology with their existing information systems.\nH4c \u2013 A greater proportion of organizations that have adopted a slap and ship adoption strategy will have\nprogressed beyond a trial to operational deployment than those organizations that have an integrated\napproach.\nMETHOD\nFollowing adoption studies in other domains (Ellram, 1996), a cross-sectional survey\napproach to hypothesis testing was used. Telephone interviews were used in order to\nreach a large number of senior management respondents (Biemer and Lybergy, 2003).\nMeasures\nCustomer mandating was measured through an item with four categories: those already\nusing a mandate; those currently required to fulfil a mandate at a specified future date; a\ncustomer mandate being anticipated but not yet in force; and no customer mandate being\nanticipated. The industry sector classification used was retailing; transport, distribution\nand logistics; manufacturers of consumer goods including food and drink; and industrial\nmanufacturers. Organizational innovativeness was assessed by the respondent\u2019s\nperception, and measured by a five-point item whose categories are described in Table\nIII. The terms used in the study to define an organization\u2019s approach to adopting\ninnovative technologies\/approaches are: \u2018early adopter\u2019, an organization that seeks to be\namong the first to adopt new technology; \u2018fast follower\u2019 organizations that are\ndeliberately not first, but recognize the value of new technology and seek to learn from\nthe mistakes of the early adopters and quickly exploit the technology; \u2018cautious\nfollowers\u2019, those who need plenty of reassurance of the benefits of the technology from\nadopters similar to themselves; and finally, the \u2018cautiously agnostic\u2019 who have little\nexplicit or implicit strategy to adopt new technology and wait until a substantial majority\nof similar organizations have adopted the technology (Rogers, 2003; O\u2019Neill et al., 1998).\nThe respondent was asked to self-assess which of these labels best described their\norganisation\u2019s approach to the adoption of technology.\nThe level of integration was measured by a categorical variable with three values: full\nintegration; \u2018slap and ship\u2019; and hybrid, or partial integration. The respondent was asked\nwhich of three categories best described their organisation\u2019s RFID adoption, with the\ncategories briefly defined to the respondent as: \u201cA fully integrated and embedded system\nwhich placed RFID at the heart of the company\u2019s systems and processes\u201d; \u201cA \u2018slap and\n8ship\u2019 solution fulfilling the mandate but lacking an internal role\u201d; and \u201cSomewhere\nbetween embedded RFID and \u2018slap and ship\u2019 \u201d.\nThe outcome variables were measured as follows. Operational deployment was measured\nby a seven-category item ranging from operational deployment (1) to no plans for a trial\n(7), as shown in Table I. Anticipated return on investment was measured by a three-point\nitem ranging from skepticism to optimism about the anticipated ROI. Anticipated benefits\nwere measured by ordinal variables consisting of 1 (\u2018major reason\u2019); 2 (\u2018minor reason\u2019);\nand 3 (\u2018not applicable\u2019) for each of 10 potential benefits synthesized from the available\nacademic and practitioner literatures (Jayaram, et al. 2000, King, 2002, Accenture 2004;\nJuniper 2005), and listed in Table III.\nSample frame\nThe population for the survey was supply chain managers within European organizations\nfrom four industrial sectors: retailing; transport, distribution and logistics; manufacturers\nof consumer goods including food and drink; and industrial manufacturers. The survey\norganizations were selected randomly from Supply Chain Europe and Dun and Bradstreet\ndatabases and the survey was administered anonymously by telephone by native\nspeakers. Table I displays the responses, stratified according to country of response and\nstatus of RFID technology usage within the respondent\u2019s organization. There were 612\nresponses to the survey, with the 128 organizations having exposure to the use of RFID\ntechnology within their organization (trial under way or higher for the operational\ndeployment scale) being classified as the \u2018early adopters\u2019 and focused on in this paper. It\nshould be noted that whilst Table I indicates that there is a significant weighting towards\nthe UK in the sample, many of the organizations surveyed operated in multiple countries.\nAdministration of data collection was carried out by a market research agency, and\ninformation is not available on the number of managers contacted by telephone who\ndeclined to participate; furthermore, assessing non-response bias by comparing late\nrespondents to early ones (Li and Calantone 1998) cannot be carried out with this method\nof data collection. For this reason and also due to the sampling from the subscribers to a\npractitioner publication Supply Chain Europe, the achieved sample should be regarded as\na convenience sample with the possibility of bias relative to the population.\nRFID adoption status UK France Germany Italy Spain Sweden TOTAL\nDeployed 27 16 5 7 27 5 87\nSuccessful trial but no\ndeployment 4 1 3 0 2 0 10\nPartly successful trial\nwith no deployment 1 1 0 0 3 0 5\nUnsuccessful trial with no\ndeployment 2 0 0 0 1 1 4\nTrial currently underway 9 1 3 2 6 1 22\nPlanning a trial 32 13 10 6 9 8 78\nNo plans for a trial 226 28 43 44 21 44 406\nTOTAL 301 60 64 59 69 59 612\nTable I: RFID adoption status by country\n9Table II provides similar descriptive data on the sample\u2019s status of RFID usage but\ncategorized by industry sector rather than by country.

Hypotheses were tested\nusing the Kruskal-Wallis test, the nonparametric equivalent of one-way ANOVA, as it\nhas high statistical power (Dewberry, 2004) and is more suitable for smaller samples than\nparametric tests (Siegel, 1956). Item responses were coded so that responses that\nreported an increase in usage or benefit would result in a lower value for the mean ranks\nreturned from the Kruskal-Wallis test. For example, the scale for anticipated return on\ninvestment (ROI) is ranked from optimistic (1) to don\u2019t know (4). A brief explanation of\nthe interpretation of the Kruskal-Wallis test is included in the \u2018Notes\u2019 section at the end\nof this research paper.\nRESULTS\nTable III shows the results of the Kruskal-Wallis tests.\n10\nPERCEIVED BENEFITS\nC\nom\npl\nia\nnc\ne\nw\nith\nm\nan\nda\nte\n(s\n)\nIm\npr\nov\ned\ncu\nst\nom\ner\nse\nrv\nic\ne\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nin\nve\nnt\nor\ny\nFa\nst\ner\nsa\nle\ns\ncy\ncl\ne\nR\ned\nuc\ned\nco\nst\ns\nIn\ncr\nea\nse\npr\nic\nes\nC\nom\npe\ntit\niv\ne\nad\nva\nnt\nag\ne\nIn\nte\ngr\nat\nio\nn\nof\nsy\nst\nem\ns\nA\nnt\nic\nip\nat\ned\nR\nO\nI\nO\npe\nra\ntio\nna\nl\nde\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt\nCUSTOMER MANDATES\nAlready using 60.6 60.0 63.0 71.5 66.4 61.8 64.1 64.3 55.2 52.8\nNow required to fulfil 51.0 66.0 48.4 45.7 51.8 66.2 54.0 48.8 62.8 61.3\nExpecting to receive 52.2 59.2 62.9 50.6 61.1 56.8 61.2 50.8 61.6 78.0\nNot anticipating 71.8 65.1 65.3 65.9 62.9 65.0 64.0 70.3 62.0 67.3\nSignificance 0.009** 0.627 0.419 0.023* 0.574 0.769 0.727 0.014* 0.761\n0.01\n0**\nINDUSTRY SECTOR\nRetail 80.1 63.5 57.1 56.9 77.0 65.1 64.0 51.3 51.6 62.2\nConsumer goods 54.3 59.7 58.5 60.0 75.5 53.3 69.8 57.2 65.7 63.8\nIndustrial goods 63.2 64.1 59.5 62.6 57.6 64.5 59.1 61.9 58.2 61.7\nLogistics 63.3 63.5 70.9 65.3 58.3 66.3 63.2 70.5 57.9 65.6\nSignificance 0.087 0.900 0.253 0.859 0.044* 0.489 0.543 0.126 0.628\n0.94\n0\nORGANIZATIONAL INNOVATIVENESS\nEarly adopter 69.7 65.3 69.7 70.9 75.0 52.9 62.8 66.7 43.7 79.5\nFast follower 59.6 65.7 57.9 54.3 63.1 65.8 61.8 57.4 59.4 67.4\nCautious follower 59.7 59.6 64.1 62.2 58.1 66.8 57.4 63.2 63.2 56.3\nSelectively agnostic 62.7 61.8 49.2 57.8 56.2 44.4 56.4 59.2 56.9 63.5\nNone\/other 61.5 50.5 85.4 70.9 87.6 84.8 98.8 64.5 87.8 61.0\nSignificance 0.805 0.519 0.033* 0.489 0.060 0.012* 0.004** 0.836 0.018*\n0.12\n7\nLEVEL OF INTEGRATION\nEmbedded 55.8 55.8 57.1 52.8 54.8 47.2 56.0 55.6 55.9 62.3\nSlap and ship 54.9 58.2 55.6 55.6 51.4 61.9 54.9 59.9 51.8 57.3\nHybrid 40.8 52.4 47.0 53.8 63.0 45.1 41.3 45.8 50.2 58.7\nDon't know 68.1 62.3 62.8 64.1 63.0 64.9 65.0 62.0 63.3 62.7\nSignificance 0.026* 0.657 0.457 0.439 0.423 0.034* 0.119 0.383 0.422\n0.89\n5\n**: Significant at the 0.01 level (Asymptotic 2-tailed).\n*: Significant at the 0.05 level (Asymptotic 2-tailed)\nTable III: Relationships between the perceived outcomes of RFID adoption and hypothesised determining factors\n11\nCompliance with Customer Mandates\nThe status of the responding organization with respect to their customer mandated use of RFID is\nshown in Table IV.

Regarding the speed of the sales cycle, organizations that\nwere now required to fulfil customer mandates had the highest Kruskal-Wallis rank (i.e. the\nlowest number within Table III), indicating as hypothesized, that the presence of customer\nmandates is negatively associated with the anticipation of other benefits. A similar phenomenon\nis evident with benefits relating to the integration of systems: systems integration was more\nlikely to be anticipated as a benefit by organizations that were expected to fulfill or were\nexpecting to receive mandates as compared to those who were already using RFID in response to\ncustomer mandates. Similarly, the association between customer mandating and anticipated cost\nreduction is not statistically significant suggesting that this hypothesized benefit is not (as yet, at\nleast) carried over into practice.\nThe variation in anticipated ROI according to mandate status was not statistically significant (p=\n0.761) between groups. Organizations that were using RFID in response to mandates from\ncustomers were more likely, with statistical significance between groups, to have deployed RFID\nthan those who had received or were expecting to receive mandates. This result is as\nhypothesised.\nWith respect to the hypotheses that were proposed: H1a (lower anticipated benefits for mandated\nRFID adopters) was partially confirmed. The anticipated benefits were viewed differently (with\nstatistical significance between groups) for mandate compliance, speed of sales cycle and systems\nintegration. Organizations using RFID perceived these benefits as being lower than those that\nhad not operationalized the technology. H1b was not confirmed, due to there being no\nstatistically significant difference between groups. H1c was confirmed: organizations with\nmandates are more likely to deploy RFID following trial.\nIndustry Sector\nThe only perceived benefit with a statistically significant difference between industry sectors is\nreduced costs (p= 0.044), with providers of industrial goods and logistics anticipating a greater\nbenefit. Whilst not statistically significant \u2013 at a cutoff of 5% - between sectors, organizations in\nthe retail sector seem to view compliance with mandates as a lesser benefit. This is due to only\n12\n4.4% of organizations in the sample that were mandated being classified within the retail sector.\nBy comparison the consumer goods (24.4%), industrial goods (37.8%) and logistics providers\n(33.4%) all had higher levels of usage due to customer mandates. Views of the different sectors\non ROI did not vary, and the operational deployment of RFID did not differ significantly between\nindustry sectors. When this last finding is coupled to the difference between sectors with respect\nto the application of mandates it can be inferred that whilst the level of mandates is low, use of\nRFID is similar Thus, the retail sector are being more proactive about the use of RFID and are\nnot simply waiting for mandates from customers.\nH2a was only partially confirmed. Manufacturers of industrial goods and logistics providers\nviewed a reduction in costs to be the greatest anticipated benefit. H2b and H2c were not\nconfirmed, indicating that the views upon ROI are consistent across sectors with operational\ndeployment also being similar across sectors.\nPerceived organizational innovativeness\nOrganizations with different perceived innovativeness have statistically significant differences in\nviews on benefits created through inventory reduction (p= 0.033) and price increases (p= 0.012).\nOrganizations perceiving themselves as early adopters view inventory reduction to be a lesser\nbenefit compared to organizations that perceive themselves to be followers. An increase in prices\nis perceived by early adopters to be of greater benefit when compared to both fast and cautious\nfollowers. Fast followers viewed the purported competitive advantage created through\ndeployment of RFID to be a lesser benefit, albeit marginally but with strong statistical\nsignificance (p= 0.004), when compared to organizations with alternative perceptions of\ninnovativeness. Early adopters anticipated greater ROI than all other organizations, with\nstatistically significant differences between the perceptions of the organizations. There was not a\nsignificant association between innovativeness and operational deployment.\nHence, hypothesis H3a was only partially confirmed. Fast followers were not as likely to\nanticipate reduced inventory or competitive advantage as a benefit when compared to cautious\nfollowers. They were also more likely to view an increase in prices as a benefit. H3b was\nconfirmed, fast followers having a more optimistic view of ROI. H3c was not confirmed as there\nwas not a statistically significant difference between organizations of differing perceptions of\ninnovativeness although fast followers were less likely to have deployed RFID based on the\nresults of the Kruskal-Wallis test.\nLevel of integration\nThe level of integration between RFID technology and the existing information systems is\nsignificantly associated with the anticipated benefits of mandate compliance (p= 0.026) and price\nincrease (p= 0.034). Organizations utilizing the hybrid solution viewed mandate compliance as a\ngreater benefit than organizations using alternative solutions, whilst organizations using the\nembedded and hybrid solutions viewed an anticipated increase in prices as a greater anticipated\nbenefit. This suggests that organizations that view mandate compliance as a great benefit are\npartially integrating RFID into their systems, possibly to achieve some of the other benefits.\nOrganizations utilizing slap and ship were less likely to view an increase in prices as an\nanticipated benefit. Views upon the ROI of RFID and level of operational deployment did not\n13\nvary at a significant level between organizations with different levels of integration, suggesting\nthat there is not (as yet, at least) one favored solution to the integration dilemma.\nHence, H4a was only partially confirmed due to non-significant differences in the responses for\nthe anticipated benefits, although organizations using slap and ship viewed price increase at a\nstatistically significant lower benefit level compared to counterparts using different solutions.\nH4b and H4c were not confirmed as significant variance between organizations was not detected.\nSummary of hypotheses\nTable V summarises whether the posited hypotheses were accepted or rejected.\nHypothesis Description Accept?\nH1a\nOrganizations adopting RFID in response to a customer mandate will have lower anticipated\nbenefits than those who have not received a mandate.

This suggests that for certain\nbenefits a \u201cgo it alone strategy\u201d will not be sufficient and the RFID implementations require a\ncollaborative approach. This has a broader implication for how the whole supply chain is\nmanaged, and in particular for the relationship dynamic that is in operation. Moreover, the\nrelationship between customer mandates and integration of RFID technology with the wider\ninformation system infrastructure suggests that decisions about RFID cannot be made in isolation\nfrom other functions and their information systems any more than from customers.\n14\nThe second finding that the presence of mandates leads to greater level of deployment reveals a\nkey characteristic of the adoption of RFID. These findings suggest that without outside pressure,\nfewer organizations will move from a trial to full operational deployment of RFID. It is clear as\nto why mandated organizations move to operational deployment \u2013 a necessary order qualifier.\nHowever, concerning those without a mandate, the findings from hypothesis H1b conclude that\nthe presence of a mandate does not have a role in determining whether or not a return on an\ninvestment is anticipated. Why is this so? Simply having a mandate does not mean an ROI will\nbe generated. Hence the ROI may be related to other factors found in previous research into the\nadoption of new technologies: size of the company (Galbraith, 1956; Bajwa and Lewis, 2003) top\nmanagement support (Teo, et al., 1997; Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Mitropoulos and Tatum,\n1999; O\u2019Niell, et al, 1998) existence of a champion (Hoffman et. al., 1996; Maxwell and\nWesterfield, 2002), internal needs (Chen, 2003; Rogers, 2003) and so on. We suggest that these\nfactors need to be taken into account when other scholars conduct research into the adoption of\nthis technology.\nThe study identified that industrial manufacturers and logistics and transportation organisations\nexpect to reduce costs more than retailers and consumer goods manufacturers. This focus on cost\nmay be explained by the absence of mandates in these sectors and a more internally motivated\nrationale for RFID adoption. Apart from costs, this study finds no difference across the sectors in\nthe ROI that is anticipated or in the extent of operational deployment. It appears that benefits are\npossible for organizations from all sectors, and that what determines whether or not a ROI can be\ngenerated, and consequently whether a trial can progress to full scale deployment, may be other\nfactors such as the type of application.\nFinally, there is no relationship of perceived organisational innovativeness on whether RFID\nbenefits are accrued, whether ROI is generated or whether trials progress to operational\ndeployment. This could be due to organizations perceiving the technology to be a continuous\ntechnology - an evolution of bar codes - as opposed to a discontinuous one (Christensen, 1997,\nUtterback, 1996). It seems that the capability to undertake a successful RFID implementation is\nnot dependent on internal innovativeness and the lack of this is not a barrier to deriving benefits\nfrom the technology and progressing beyond a trial to operational deployment.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have presented the results of a survey conducted with 612 European supply chain managers,\nanalyzing responses from 128 of these managers who had experience of adopting RFID\ntechnology. This paper sought to ascertain the impact on RFID trial success of four determining\nfactors: the presence of customer mandates; the organization\u2019s industry sector; the self-perceived\nlevel of organizational innovativeness; and the level of integration between RFID and the\norganizations other information systems. The results show that the presence of mandates from\ncustomers leads to adopting organizations moving from a trial to operational deployment. Given\nthat many retailers have made the use of RFID an \u201corder qualifier\u201d this result is to be expected.\nFurther, faster sales cycles appear to be linked to the presence of mandates, indicating that RFID\nmay provide some competitive benefit for adopting suppliers, though the link seems a complex\none.\n15\nThe second major finding is that logistics and transportation companies and industrial\nmanufacturers expect RFID to result in cost reductions for them. This could reflect the different\nmotivational drivers for these two sectors. Not being subject to mandates from their customers,\nthese early adopters may have been motivated by internal needs, including cost reduction, more\nthan external factors such as customer service. The challenge for these two groups now is to\nconsider whether or not they could achieve the benefits accrued by the other groups as a\nsecondary benefit.\nWe found no relationship between perceived organizational innovativeness and RFID adoption,\nwhich could be due to the perception of RFID only being an evolutionary progression from\nbarcode technology, rather than a radical or discontinuous technology, at least as it is being\napplied in a supply chain context. Finally, the level of IS integration employed by adopting\norganizations did not have an effect on the outcomes achieved. This may indicate that there are\ncertain conditions under which all three IS integration strategies \u2013 full integration, \u2018slap and ship\u2019\nand a hybrid of the two - are appropriate.\nThis study has a number of limitations, the first of which are the geographic and industry sector\nfoci. Secondly, this is a fast moving field of research, where practice often moves faster than\ntheory is able to keep up: further qualitative research to explore emergent benefits and factors\ninfluencing adoption would help to frame future survey work. Specifically, we believe further\nexploratory research is needed into the specific RFID applications that are being employed in the\ncontext of supply chains, and specifically, what benefits are they accruing, what levels of ROI are\nbeing generated and which applications are becoming assimilated into everyday operations.\nAnother specific topic we hope future researchers will consider is exploration of the factors\nwhich determine whether a slap and ship or fully integrated approach is required. Future survey\nwork will be aided by the greater rates of adoption that can be expected with time, and hence by\ngreater sample sizes of early adopters, which would increase the statistical power of tests and\ntherefore the likelihood of identifying adoption factors which are, in fact, present. And finally,\nthis paper has not investigated those that have not adopted this technology at all and their reasons\nfor not having as yet planned RFID trials: this is an important area for future research, which\nmight draw on such precedents as Shih and Venkatesh (2004) who examined factors influencing\nadoption and factors influencing the success of that adoption in a single, integrated model.\nREFERENCES\nAberdeen Group (2004).

It is a non-parametric equivalent of\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA). The K-W test assumes that the variable being studied has an\nunderlying continuous distribution, therefore any survey instrument should use at least ordinally\nscaled items. The computation of the K-W test involves the replacement of each of the N\nobservations. For example the lowest score is replaced by rank 1, the second lowest by rank 2\nand the highest by rank N. When this has been performed the sum of the ranks in each sample is\ncomputed with the K-W test determining whether the sums of ranks are disparate according to a\nchi-square distribution.\nAbout the authors\nAndrew White\nDr. Andrew White is a Fellow in Strategic Innovation at Said Business School, University of\nOxford.
