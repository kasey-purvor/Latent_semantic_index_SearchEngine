It is surprising, therefore, that relatively little time \nhas been devoted to the study of business travel, both as a facet of contemporary \nmobility and as an economic practice. In this paper we review how existing literatures \nprovide insights that can be used to understand the role of business travel as \ninternational labour mobility in the contemporary professional service economy. In \ndoing so, we reach the conclusion that there seems to be at least two significant \nvoids preventing a more sophisticated understanding from emerging. First, we \nsuggest that international business travel needs to be studied not in isolation but \ninstead as one component in a wider ecology of mobility that \u201eproduces\u201f the global \nfirm. Second, we argue that it is important to know more about the time-space \ndynamics of international business travel in terms of how spatial relations are \nproduced and reproduced by different forms and geographies of travel. We make \nthese arguments and explore their implications using data collected through \ninterviews in advertising, architecture and legal professional service firms. We \nconclude by identifying a research agenda designed to allow a better understanding \nof business travel to emerge in corporate and mobility discourses.  \n \nKey words  \nbusiness travel; mobility; professional services; Europe \n \n \n \n3 \nIntroduction \n \nInternational business travel has always been an important labour process in \nthe accumulation of capital for the firm, facilitating the enactment of business \nthrough face-to-face meetings with clients and subcontractors and, in \ninternational firms, also allowing collaboration between employees in cross-\nborder projects and management control of overseas subsidiaries. However, \nspurred on by processes of globalization, de-regulation in the airline industry \nand the opening of new markets in regions such as the former-Soviet Union, \ncentral Europe and China, international business travel within, from and to \nEurope has become an even more important practice of global work in the late \ntwentieth and early twenty-first century (Davidson and Cope, 2003; Jones, \n2007, 2008).  Partly acting as a substitute for secondments and expatriation \non cost grounds, and partly providing a new means to increase levels and the \nspeed of cross-border business (Beaverstock, 2007; Millar and Salt, 2008), \ngrowth in international business travel has been charted in official statistics. \nFor example, the number of United Kingdom (U.K.) residents leaving the \ncountry for business purpose visits reached 8.56 million in 2005, a 40 percent \nincrease from ten years earlier, with Europe (EU15) accounting for an average \nof 72% of overseas business visits by UK citizens between 1993 and 2005 \n(Office for National Statistics, 2006; 1996).    \n \nFurther evidence of the proliferation of business travel journeys is provided by \nthe rapid expansion of an industry which exists entirely to service the \neveryday requirements of the business traveller. From airline lounges to \n4 \nbusiness class only airlines, hotels with business centres and an array of \nintelligence services offering real time information for the business traveller \n(e.g. Business Travel Solutions www.biztrip.co.uk), the international traveller\u201fs \nneeds are now comprehensively catered for.   \n \nWhat is not in doubt, then, is that business travel is being produced on a \nglobal scale by \u201eobligations of proximity\u201f and \u201eface-to-face\u201f (f2f) contact with \nclients, suppliers or corporate colleagues (Beaverstock, 2007; Faulconbridge \n2006; Jones, 2007) as the need for \u201emeetingness\u201f remains (Urry, 2003).  It is \nsurprising, therefore, that relatively little time has been devoted specifically to \nthe study of business travel, both as an economic practice and facet of \ncontemporary mobility.  As of December 2008, we discover only 740 \npublished outputs on \u201ebusiness travel\u201f identified by the Thomson ISI Web of \nKnowledge Social Science database. This compares poorly with other forms \nof mobility such as \u201etemporary migration\u201f (1,469 papers) and pilgrimage \n(2,136).  \n \nDespite this apparent paucity of academic research, existing literatures do still \nprovide some important insights that can be used to understand the role of \nbusiness travel as labour mobility in the contemporary service economy. In \nthis paper we analyse a number of these literatures, use them to explain the \nimportance of business travel in the contemporary global economy and, by \ncoupling them to empirical analysis, highlight important future avenues for \nresearch. Indeed, we suggest that our empirical material provides insights into \nat least two significant sets of research questions that are currently \n5 \nunanswered, thus preventing the emergence of a more sophisticated \nunderstanding of the role of business travel in the global economy.  \n \nFirst, we suggest that business travel should not be studied in isolation, but \ninstead should be seen as one of many forms of mobility that \u201eproduce\u201f the \nglobal firm (see Jones, 2005). In this guise business travel is one part of an \necology of mobility in which spatially dispersed organizations are brought to \nlife by the movement of people, but also objects, ideas, texts and images \n(Urry, 2000; 2007). The recent \u201emobilities turn\u201f in the social sciences (Sheller \nand Urry, 2006) is associated with a proliferation of studies of different forms \nof business mobility from train travel (Holley, Jain and Lyons, 2008), to airline \nnetworks (Derudder et al., 2008) and the car (Laurier, 2004). We, therefore, \nuse insights from such studies to highlight the way business travel in \ninternational professional service firms (PSFs) operates as part of an ecology \nof mobility in which the interdependent use of different forms of mobility allow \nthe completion of business and the management of spatially distributed \nsubsidiaries. We use PSFs as a case study to illustrate our arguments \nbecause travel, face-to-face meetings and the social cues embodied \nencounters allow have been shown in the existing literature to be even more \nimportant in professional services work than in other sectors of the economy. \nAs most business services are knowledge-rich, bespoke and often hard to \nassess, meetings allow relationships based on trust to be developed between \nservice providers and clients (Daniels, 1993; L\u00f8wendahl, 2001). Meanwhile, \nthe increasing use of project teams that encompass individuals from several \nnational and international offices has been shown to require meetings both to \n6 \ncreate bonds between team members, but also engage in brainstorming and \ninnovation which requires the development of reciprocity in relationships \n(Beaverstock, 2004; Faulconbridge, 2006; Grabher, 2001, 2004 Jones, 2005, \n2007).  This means our analysis of ecologies of mobility in PSFs reveals a \nnumber of significant questions about the effects and futures of business \ntravel that cannot be understood through existing work. This forms the basis \nfor a research agenda developed towards the end of the paper.   \n \nSecond, and related, we use the analytical tools of work on transnational \ncorporations (TNCs) (Dicken, 2007), their relational forms (Yeung, 2005), \nproduction networks (Dicken et al., 2001; Coe, Dicken and Hess, 2008) and \nthe resultant spatial divisions of labour (Massey, 1994, 2004) to explore the \ntime-space dynamics of business travel and the geographical implications of \nconnection and disconnection produced by mobile workers. In particular we \nanalyse our empirical material by developing recent work on global PSFs \n(Beaverstock, 2006; Faulconbridge 2007a; Jones, 2007) which provides \ninsights into how spatial relations are produced and reproduced differently by \ntravel depending on travel\u201fs function, place of origin and destination. As we \nshow, this again raises a number of important questions about business \ntravel, this time in terms of its impacts and its relationship to power relations \nwithin firms.  \n \nAccordingly, the rest of this paper is organised into three main parts.  First, we \ndraw on existing literature that helps us theorise business travel and identify \npressing research questions.  Second, we use our empirical material to \n7 \nexplore these research questions with particular focus on the role of business \ntravel in ecologies of corporate mobility and the time-space dimensions of \ninternational business travel.  We finish the paper by positing several \nconclusions and agendas which re-emphasises our argument that \ninternational business travel is now so significant as a form of mobility that it \ndeserves more sustained academic scrutiny.   \n \n \nConceptualising international business travel \n \nThe study of international business travel as a mode of cross-border mobility \nhas, until recently, been treated as an incidental process of knowledge \ntransfer that is much the same as skilled international migration and inter-\ncompany personnel transfers (see for example see Ewers, 2007; Koser and \nSalt, 1997; Williams, 2006).  Bucking this theoretical and empirical focus has \nbeen the recent work of Millar and Salt (2008) on portfolios of mobility \nsystems in transnational corporations in which they use aerospace and \nextractive industries as examples of different uses of business travel.   Millar \nand Salt (2008) show that long-term assignments (over a year) tend to be \nused for the development of an individual\u201fs career or to locate a skilled \nemployee where their expertise is needed. Meanwhile short-term assignments \n(up to a year) are used to fulfil a particular business need, such as to provide \na labour force for a particular job. Business travel, which Millar and Salt (2008) \ndefine as travel where presence in another office is for less than 30 days, was \nfound in their study to be used for project meetings or when an individual is \n8 \nrequired to train someone in another office or use their expertise to solve a \nparticular problem in a project.  Throughout, though,, the common \ndenominator which necessitated travel was the requirement of a physical \npresence in an international location.   \n \nIn the guise of the mobilities paradigm, such questions about the compulsions \nof physical co-presence have received increasing scrutiny over the past \ndecade. The seminal work of Urry (see 2000, 2007; Sheller and Urry, 2006), \nhas perhaps been most important, developing a sophisticated argument about \nhow mobility defines contemporary social life.  This is not the place to unpack \nthe emergent mobilities paradigm in detail; others have done that elsewhere \n(Cresswell, 2001; Urry, 2007). Instead, we consider the main learnings from \nthis work that can help us interpret the role of ecologies of business travel in \nPSFs. In particular we develop two of the main debates in recent literature: \nthe role of face-to-face (f2f) contact and the emergence of ecologies of \nmobility in organizations.  \n \n \nFace-to-face contact, PSFs and ecologies of mobility  \n \nAs recent work on mobility in investment banking noted:  \n\u201cthe key process by which professional services interact with clients \n\u2026 is through face-to-face contact, with clients, competitors, \nsuppliers and colleagues \u2026 Face-to-face relationships are \nreciprocal processes which not only share and disseminate tailor-\n9 \nmade, non-routine and often \u201eone-off\u201f solutions to clients, but also as \nthe medium for interaction with teams of actors where deal-making \noften requires specialist input from a range of professional services \n\u2026 International mobility, therefore, is a key factor of production in \nthe professional service firm\u201d (Beaverstock, 2006, 54-55)  \n \nSuch debates about face-to-face contact have a long history. Back to the work \nof Goffman (1967) on the interaction order there has been fascination with the \nrituals of embodied encounter and the value-added gained from the sensory \nrichness of physical co-presence. In the context of firms, Boden and Molotoch \n(1994) developed a convincing account of the role of f2f talk in business and \nemphasised how: \n\u201c[m]odernity is made possible not by the substitution of new \ntechnologies of copresence, but by a tensely adjusted distribution of \ncopresence\u201d (Boden and Molotoch, 1994, p. 258, original \nemphasis).  \n \nSuch debates have continued in the Twenty-First century, in particular in \nrelation to innovation in the contemporary \u201eknowledge economy\u201f. The \nimportance of \u201ebeing there\u201f in the city has been emphasised (Storper and \nVenables, 2002) whilst occasional co-presence with colleagues in globally \ndistributed offices of TNCs has been shown to lead to the emergence of \ntransnational communities of practice (see Amin and Cohendet, 2004). This \ninvolves developing relational spaces of learning (Faulconbridge, 2007a-b), \nteamwork within projects (Grabher 2001, 2004) and collaboration and \ncooperation (Bathelt and Gl\u00fccker, 2005), all of which rely on occasional f2f \n10 \ncontact for the development of trust, reciprocity and mutual understanding. \nIndeed, Jones (2007, p.229-230, original emphasis) summarises insights in \nexisting work and suggests f2f interactions, \u201cconstitute many of the key \npractices and events that shape the development of corporate globality\u201d. In \nglobalizing law firms, as in other PSFs, Jones suggests f2f encounter has five \nfunctions: \n1. The operation of the firm \u2013 face-to-face meetings allow the securing of \nnew business (when meeting clients) and the completion of projects \nwith colleagues in spatially distributed offices. \n2. The control of the firm \u2013 face-to-face meetings between employees of \nthe same firm allow management to convince workers in different \noffices to implement strategic plans (see also Faulconbridge, 2008). \n3. Knowledge practices \u2013 face-to-face meeting allow the production, \nsharing and deployment of the knowledge employees in PSFs need to \nbe effective. \n4. Innovation \u2013 face-to-face meetings allow new ways of working and new \ntypes of service to be developed. \n5. Coherence \u2013 face-to-face meetings allow the creation of a shared \norganisational culture as interactions between employees allow \nunderstanding to be developed of how their behaviour differs from that \nof the firm\u201fs role-model employees. \n \nExisting studies suggests that f2f contact is vital is such situations because \nICTs are unable to deliver the type of interaction needed. The \u201esocial cues\u201f \ngained from embodied encounter are said to be vital but missing in the narrow \n11 \nsocial \u201ebandwidth\u201f environment of virtual communication technologies (see \nLassen, 2006; Hildrum, 2007; Orlikowski, 2002).  \n \nImportant as such work is, it does, however, fail to consider mobility systems \nin their entirety and fails to position business travel and f2f encounter as \ncooperating and reliant on the existence of other mobility practices (see Urry, \n2007). Perhaps one of the main insights that can be taken from recent work \ncompleted as part of the mobilities turn is the importance of recognising travel \nas one component of a wider ecology of mobility made-up of \u201cthe movement \nof people, objects, capital and information across the world\u201d (Hannam, Sheller \nand Urry, 2006, p.1). Indeed, as Jones (2007, p.232) goes on to argue in his \ndiscussion of f2f contact, \n\u201c\u2026it is dangerous to demarcate face-to-face interaction as \nontologically distinct from other firms of interaction. Whilst \napparently purely social interaction, face-to-face is better \nconceptualized through an actor-network informed approach that \ntraces the distant and non-human associations that shape it as an \nevent\u201d.  \n \nIn most existing studies of business travel (e.g. Lassen, 2006; Millar and Salt, \n2008) we either hear about the use of technology, or the use of travel and f2f \ncontact, but not the cooperation between the two.  As \u201cvirtual travel has to be \nunderstood in relationship with corporeal travel\u201d (Urry, 2000, p.75), it would \nseem that the emphasis of research should not, therefore, be on just how \ndecision making might be influenced by f2f encounter and\/or the mobility of \n12 \nideas and documents, but how an increasing preponderance to the use of \ntelephone, email and videoconferencing to convey words, images and \ndocuments is related to the production of ecologies of mobility in which the \ncooperation and interdependence of different forms of mobility is related to the \nneed for and use of travel itself. This means looking at how virtual \ncommunication might create a need for as well as prevent travel, how different \nforms of travel in the mobility portfolios Millar and Salt (2008) identify are \ninterdependent, and how firms manage business travel not as an isolated \nbusiness practice but as one tool in their communications toolkit. We develop \nthis argument about the importance of studying entire ecologies of mobility \nbelow. In doing this we also consider how an explicit focus on business \ntravel\u201fs role in ecologies of mobility might help us understand the creation and \nreproduction of spatial relations and politics in organizations, something that \ncan yield important insights for geographical debates about mobility.  \n \nEcologies of mobility and geometries of power \n \nWork on relation economic geography (Yeung, 2005) and global production \nnetworks (Dicken et al., 2001; Coe, Dicken and Hess, 2008) has revealed that \nthere are important \u201epower geometries\u201f that underlie the creation of, and that \nare caused by, the activities of TNCs. Both in relation to firm-supplier relations \nbut also place-place relations, the forms of transnational connection that are \nmanufactured by TNCs can influence both the flow of goods and services but \nalso the forms of dominance, reliance or subordination that exist between \ndifferent individuals, groups, countries or regions.  \n13 \n \nThrough the concept of \u201egeometries of power\u201f, Massey (1994) was one of the \nfirst to highlight the importance of recognising the power and political effects \nof processes of time-space compression. Indeed, the mobilities paradigm has \nalso taken a cue from Massey\u201fs work to develop a number of concepts that \nrecognise the importance of inclusion in, and the significance of exclusion \nfrom, contemporary mobile worlds. Urry (2007, p.197) uses the concept of \n\u201enetwork capital\u201f to signify, \u201cthe capacity to engender and sustain social \nrelations with those people who are not necessarily proximate and which \ngenerates emotional, financial and practical benefit\u201d. Developing Putnam\u201fs \n(2000) work on social capital, Urry shows how certain social groups benefit \ndisproportionately from mobility and are better equipped to realize its potential \nfor developing social relations that stretch beyond the physically proximate. \nKaufmann, Bergman and Joye (2004, p.750) make a similar point with the \nconcept of motility. For them, \u201cMotility can be defined as the capacity of \nentities (e.g. goods, information or persons) to be mobile in social and \ngeographical space, or as the way in which entities access and appropriate \nthe capacity for socio-spatial mobility according to their circumstances\u201d. \nAccess, competence and appropriation define an individual or group\u201fs motility \ncapacity and, according to Kaufmann and colleagues, it is therefore necessary \nto study in more detail the factors influencing potential mobility and the \nbenefits it might bring.  \n \nFrom a geographical perspective exploring selectivity in the enactment of \nbusiness travel -who travels and whether it occurs \u2013 and where people travel \n14 \nfrom and to and the implications of such geographies is important if we are to \nbetter understand the impacts of mobility capital on individuals and the \nconsequences for places and spatial relations. For example, Faulconbridge \n(2007a) shows how in global legal PSFs who gets to travel is defined both by \nthe identity of employees (seniority, gender etc.) but also by the strategic role \nof a subsidiary, with those senior (often male) employees in the most powerful \noffices of global firms often travelling more frequently as part of the \n\u201emanagement control\u201f and \u201ecultural coherence\u201f strategies Jones (2007) \ndescribes. This reproduces the power and control of certain subsidiaries.     \nIn the next section we, therefore, also consider questions about the way \nbusiness travel, as part of a broader ecology of mobility, is involved in the \nproduction of organizational politics and power relations and the implications \nof this. Using extensive studies of advertising, architecture and law firms, we \nshow that if we consider business travel explicitly and its geographies and \nrelationships to other forms of mobility, we develop rich, process-led \nunderstandings of the role of f2f encounters and their geographical \nimplications that have relevance to debates about TNCs and the globalization \nof PSFs, as well as much wider questions about spatial divisions of labour, \npower relations in the global economy and sustainability.  \n \nThe empirical material analysed below was collected from 120 interviews with \nprofessionals in three types of global professional services: advertising \n(quotations marked A); architecture (AR); and law (L). Our aim here is not to \nhighlight industry specificities, but to use data collected to develop an \nempirical and theoretical framework for analysing business travel\u201fs role in \n15 \ncorporate ecologies of mobility. Interviews were all with practitioners in firms \nwith multiple international offices. Interviewees were selected to represent the \nrange of specialisms within each industry (e.g. in law mergers and \nacquisitions, litigation etc.) and held positions ranging from the most senior in \nan office (e.g. office managing partner) to the most junior (trainee or new \nrecruit). Interviews were recorded, transcribed and coded and analysed using \nthe logics of grounded theory. Interviewees were asked to respond to \nquestions about a range of issues including processes of knowledge \nmanagement and learning, management control in global PSFs, teamwork \ninvolving individuals in spatially distributed offices and the development of \nglobal corporate cultures. As a result, business travel was not the explicit \nfocus on interviews. However, it quickly became clear that travel had a role, \nalongside other forms of mobility, in all of these facets of work in PSFs. In the \ndiscussion below the identity of interviewees and their firms have been \nremoved to ensure anonymity is maintained. \n \nEcologies of business travel mobility in global professional service \nfirms \n \nAn advertising executive captures succinctly the benefits of business travel for \nproducing the glue that holds the firm together:  \n\u201c\u2026 at our conferences, so say for example the recent European \nconference, the chatting, exchanging ideas over coffee, lunch etc is \nmore important than the actual speakers.  Getting to know these \n16 \npeople socially, having a drink with them is really important.  Then \nyou\u201fve got someone to call in the future\u201d (A4). \n \nYet this description of the moment of f2f encounter tells only part of the story. \nPartly travel occurs out of necessity in global PSFs. But as one lawyer \ncommented, \n \u201c\u2026in the ideal world it would always be nice to meet face-to-face \nand to be able to work together\u2026but the reality is that it costs \nmoney because someone\u201fs going to have to get on a plane\u2026That\u201fs \nthe ideal scenario but in reality people are often going to try and \navoid doing that so you\u201fll use the other most effective ways so \ninevitably you will talk to each other on the phone\u201d (L3). \n \nConsequently, business travel has to be managed and used as part of a \nbroader socio-technical system designed to allow both the completion of \nbusiness (providing advice to a client; working with a colleague to brainstorm \nand develop a solution to a particular project problem) but also the \nmanufacturing of social relationships between colleagues, clients and, in \nsome cases, competitors when travel is to trade fairs or conferences (see \nMaskell, Bathelt and Malmberg, 2006).1 As a result, the many forms of \n                                            \n1\n It is important to recognise that not all business travel is intra-firm (i.e. between offices of the \nsame firm). Travel to meet clients at their offices, suppliers or sub-contractors and travel to \nconferences and trade shows are all relevant forms of business travel (see Davidson and \nCope, 2003). Here, however, we solely focus upon intra-firm travel because, according to our \nresearch, it is the most frequent and critical form of travel for the production of professional \nservices.  \n17 \ntechnical device that allow what Urry (2007) calls \u201evirtual mobility\u201f are \nfrequently used alongside and during business travel in all of the sectors \nstudied. For example, architects rely on corporate intranets for the \nmanagement of \u201cwho\u201fs who\u201d lists, for providing colleagues with updates on a \nproject or for gaining insights into a past project through \u201clessons learned\u201d \nreports. Video-conferencing and instant messaging technologies also facilitate \nforms of daily social interaction between colleagues in spatially separated \noffices. Alongside these technologies, carefully managed business travel is \nused. From the outset, though, strategies seek to minimise the frequency at \nwhich f2f contact is needed and maximise the value of virtual mobilities. In \nparticular, the global conference, where key (sometimes all) members of the \nfirm are invited to attend an annual get-together and networking event, is a \ncommon way of allowing the benefits of f2f contact to be maximised with \nminimum (both in terms of frequency but also duration) levels of travel. As an \ninterviewee described: \n\u201cThere are formal comings together, there\u201fs a global conference \ncoming next month where literally representatives from all the \nworldwide offices will be there.  There\u201fs presentations about the \nbusiness but there is a social side to that so that we are gelling as a \nnetwork rather than just being pins in the map\u201d (AD5). \n \nSuch structured events don\u201ft prevent corporeal mobility becoming important at \nother times. But the \u201enetwork gelling\u201f process the interviewee described \nwhereby individuals get to know their colleagues in other offices does lead to \nthe opportunity to establish, consolidate and re-confirm relationships that \n18 \nminimise the future need for travel (see also Faulconbridge 2007a-b). Indeed, \nit was common for interviewees to express their concerns about their hyper-\nmobility (in terms of financial, personal and environmental cost) and suggests \nthat thinking carefully about when to travel was vital.  Consequently, an \nintangible, hard to define, instinctive decision about whether to travel has to \nbe made on a regular basis. As one architect described the dilemma he faced \nin his managerial role: \n\u201cMy day starts with a call to Ohio, I go to Utah on Friday, we were in \nSeattle last week, so yes email, video conferencing. The really \ninteresting thing that I have noticed is that 2 or 3 years ago \neverybody wanted to travel, they wanted to work in far flung areas, \nnow people who came out of school in last 5 years aren\u201ft so \nbothered about doing a job in South Korea and being away for a \nweek in 4, like I do, so there is an interesting generation thing going \nin now, so I\u201fm not sure if we will have to rely more on video \nconferencing and not go, personally I think that will be a downfall for \nme nothing beats making eye contact with that other person, you \ncant get that over a video conference and that to me will be an \ninteresting cultural development over the coming years. I think \ncommunication will be interesting, I get text messages from people 3 \ndesks away, those coming out of college now think in a different \nway, so my mind is on what we are doing now but I\u201fm also looking at \nthe future and thinking how can we as a firm get to grips with \ncommunicating in way that the next generation does\u201d (AR 34). \n \n19 \nWhilst there are many interesting issues highlighted by this quote in relation to \ngenerational shifts in communication, most significant for our argument is the \nway the discussion places the question of when to travel at the forefront of \nconsiderations. This suggests that the study of business travel has to be \ncouched alongside studies of other forms of mobilities that are part of \ncorporate ecologies and which may well influence when travel, rather than \nvirtual mobility, is used to allow interaction with a colleague or client. Indeed, \nfollowing Millar and Salt (2008), it also seems important to consider how \noptions in terms of the duration of travel also play a role in developing \ncorporate ecologies of mobility, with a mix of virtual interactions, short, \nmedium and longer term travel all cooperating to allow global PSFs to \noperate.  We return to the significance of this in the discussion section of the \npaper. First though, it is important to recognise other factors that determine \nwhether travel occurs and the outcome of business travel.      \n  \nTime and space in ecologies of business travel mobility \n \nPutting time and space at the centre of discussions of business travel reveals, \nfuirstly, that metric forms of space - i.e. distance in kilometres between places \n\u2013 continues to influence the activities of globalizing firms. In the case of \nbusiness travel, metric space determines if and how often business travel \noccurs. At its simplest, as Sheppard (2002) reminds us, this is because time \ndoesn\u201ft completely trump space and metric distance continues to determine \nthe degrees of connectivity between places. Most fundamentally, long \nduration journeys are often impractical because of their expense financially \n20 \nand in terms of time (see also Nowica, 2006).  Indeed, Millar and Salt (2008) \nreport that business managers often seek to reduce the amount of long-haul \ntravel employees complete because of the physical and mental toll it takes on \nthe body. Consequently, places both metrically and temporally distant from \nthe Western European (London in particular) homes of many globalizing PSFs \nare often more isolated in global organizational networks. As one lawyer \nsuggested, \n\u201c\u2026our Asia offices, because they are a long way away, have a \nhigher degree of autonomy.  Not withstanding the developments in \ninformation technology and communications, they are a long way \naway\u201d (L2). \n \nSecondly, and complicating this ideas, as Zook and Brun (2006) note, the way \nthe airline industry organises itself means certain places are \u201ecloser together\u201f \nthan others. As a result, it is not just metric distance that matters. Relational, \ntopological spaces also determines if and how often travel occurs. Distant \ndirect city-pairs (cities such as London and Moscow with direct connecting \nflights) are often closer in travel time that more proximate city pairs without a \ndirect connecting flight (e.g. Manchester and Seville). Consequently, the \noccurrence and frequency of business travel is often associated with a \ncombination of metric distance but also flight time with the two not necessarily \nrelated. Firms, therefore, often give significant amounts of autonomy to local \nmanagers in offices that are \u201edistant\u201f (temporally and\/or spatially) from \nheadquarters or \u201elead\u201f offices. As a result, such offices operate more like \noutposts that serve clients \u201elocal\u201f needs, being significantly less integrated into \n21 \nthe firms global production network that other parts of the organization. As the \nsame lawyer quoted above went onto say: \n\u201cIt\u201fs the 80\/20 rule.  Given that you can\u201ft do everything you choose \nwhere you\u201fre going to put your money and your efforts into building \nrelationships.  That doesn\u201ft mean we\u201fve abandoned say Bangkok \nbut you can\u201ft give equal weight to every place we\u201fve got.  If Thai \nlawyers are primarily doing Thai law, for example, they\u201fre not really \ndoing cross border work, the need for them to communicate is much \nless\u201d (L2). \n \nThe reduced levels of business travel and ultimately organizational integration \ncaused by such \u201eperipherality\u201f raises a number of important questions. Do \nthose working in \u201edistant\u201f outposts suffer from a lack of network capital and \nmotility and with what consequences? Does reduced mobility bring benefits or \ncosts in terms of the effective operation of such offices, the career \ndevelopment of individuals and the production of organizational globality? \nDoes it mean there are very different types of power relation between distant \noffices compared to those in the organizational core of Western Europe and \nNorth America where more regular inter-office travel might occur?  \n \nTo answer these questions recognition is needed that it is not only the \noccurrence of travel that is significant in terms of connectivity, dis-connectivity \nand power relation in global PSFs (and the global economy more widely). \nWhen travel does occur, who gets to travel, from where and for what purpose \nis also highly significant.  \n \n22 \nPower and politics in ecologies of business travel mobility \n \nThe nature of intra-firms spatial relationships and the politics of those \nrelationships can have a significant influence on the nature of business travel \nin PSFs. Three different uses of business travel exemplify this and show how \nthe traveller and her\/his purpose affects the outcomes of mobility. \n \nFirst, and at one extreme, business travel can be used as part of command \nand control tactics. In advertising the work of global mega-agencies like Ogilvy \nand Mather often involves certain offices being given the task of fulfilling low-\nlevel, often deskilled roles in the advertising production process with strategic \nactivities concentrated in the centre \u2013 often leading world cities like London, \nFrankfurt or Paris. This is most obviously the case when so-called \u201epost-box\u201f \noffices have responsibility for implementing an advert in their host-country (i.e. \narranging for a local language voice over; negotiating with local television \ncompanies), but have no responsibility for the strategic work involved in \nproducing an advert (account planning, creative production etc). Such a \nstrategy is becoming less and less common as increasingly reflexive and \nfragmented consumer markets emerge (Grein and DuCoffe, 2001), but \ncontinues to be important when major global, one advert worldwide \ncampaigns are run. Business travel in such an approach principally involves \naccount managers from lead offices travelling infrequently to ensure \nsubsidiaries are following the instructions sent to them, or advertising \nexecutives travelling from the \u201epost-box\u201f to the lead office to receive \n23 \ninstructions and guidance. As a result one advertiser described the following \nsituation, \n\u201cWhat happens more is that there is a lead office that has \nresponsibility for generating much of the work, but sometimes you\u201fd \nget together.  So [client x], we run that globally, and last year we had \nhub meetings where we\u201fd get together with offices from Eastern \nEurope etc and ensure they\u201fre clear on their role\u201d (AD6).       \n \nHence the role of business travellers from lead offices in the most advanced \nadvertising markets \u2013 e.g. London, Munich for example \u2013 to emerging \nadvertising markets \u2013 Baku, Ljubljana or Riga \u2013 invokes and reproduces \ncertain forms of spatial power relation between places and people.  \n \nSecond, business travel can have a role in forms of negotiated compromise in \nwhich \u201eheadquarters\u201f controls the firm but not through command and control \ntactics. As Jones (2007) has shown, f2f contact and business travel has an \nimportant role in aligning offices with the strategies of and visions of the \nleaders of the firm. Whilst not having formal headquarters, most professional \nservice firms are heavily influenced by the ideals and practice of the firm\u201fs \nhome-country. Indeed, it is from the home-country of the firm that managing \npartners and influential leaders often emerge. Business travel by both these \nleaders but also their representatives (senior executives, practice group \nleaders) is, as a result, often used to facilitate f2f negotiations, allow leaders to \nunderstand the national variations in practice and socialise members of \noverseas offices into the norms of the firm (see Faulconbridge, 2008). Indeed, \n24 \nlawyers described the role of business travel for training lawyers in offices \noutside of leading financial centres to follow \u201efirm\u201f, usually Anglo-American \nbest practice. As one noted: \n\u201cthere are only certain offices in the network that are allowed to run \nmulti-jurisdictional deals.  They tend to be the money markets, so \nChicago, New York, London and Frankfurt.  So we tend to find that \nthere the offices that go off and train other offices on what the \npractices are for doing a multijurisdictional deal.  So once a year, \npeople from the London office go off and train all of Latin America \nassociates on global M&A\u201d (L1). \n \nAs a result, in many ways this socializing role for business travel can be \nassociated with the \u201eAmericanization\u201f process that others have described (see \nDjelic, 1998). At the European level such business travel in PSFs is \nparticularly intense between the London offices of firms \u2013 which are frequently \nthe home-country offices of the firm or the European headquarters for US \nfirms \u2013 and other European cities as attempts are made to socialize workers \ninto Anglo-American business practices. This is especially important in the \ncases of finance and law (see Beaverstock, 2006; Faulconbridge, 2008). \nConsequently wider structural changes that have been examined under the \nrubrics of dynamics varieties if capitalism and the dynamics of institutional \nsystems (Katz and Darbishire, 2000) might be better understood in terms of \ncauses, trajectories and geographies through an examination of the integral \nrole of business travel within organizations in the negotiation of change. Again \nquestions of who travels, from where and to where and with what purpose and \noutcome are important.  \n25 \n \nAt the opposite end of the spectrum to the command and control tactics \ndescribed in advertising, global architecture firms often create a spatial \ndivision of labour based on expertise in their projects. This can involve the off-\nshoring of processes to locations that can provide services more cheaply \n(Tombesi et. al., 2003) but also the fragmentation of project work to tap into \nthe expertise of architects located in different offices or to collaborate with \ncolleagues in other offices with relevant expertise. For example, a firm may \nhave a group of computer scripting experts located in London who manage \nthe refinement of designs produced by a group of stadium design experts in \nParis. As one architect described the collaborative arrangement between two \noffices in his firm: \n\u201cWe had never done a research building before\u2026But there people in \nthe firm who had\u2026So as soon as we started pursuing the research \nbuilding we started calling people we knew who had pursued labs, \nwe called lab consultants and picked their brains, but that is the \nculture and it is one of the assets of (name of firm). I think the \naverage architecture firm is 12 people, here there are 190 people \nthat are all pretty much at the top of their game, and then there is \nthe other 800 people in the firm\u201d (AR33). \n \nIn this \u201etransnational\u201f setup mobility has very different geographies. It involves \nindividuals moving in both directions between offices because of (and \nreproducing) organizational globality premised on very different power \nrelations in which collaboration leads to values of mutual support and respect.  \n26 \nWe could develop a similar argument in relation to the role of business travel \nin project ecologies (Grabher, 2001, 2004). Indeed, PSFs frequently operate \nusing intra- and inter-firm project teams and all of the discussions so far about \ntrust and the cooperation between virtual and corporeal mobility could have \nbeen couched in the context of project work. In projects it has been noted that \npower relations have an important role in facilitating work (stopping \ncontinuous negotiation), but can also prohibit effective collaboration \n(command and control tactics) (Bernuth and Bathelt, 2007). When projects are \nspatially distributed, business travel, is therefore, influenced by and becomes \nan essential part of reproducing these power relations.     \n \nThe discussions above of geography and its significance highlights, then, the \ninequalities that business travel can (re)produce or, if used appropriately \ndismantle. Sheppard (2002) has shown that the geography of the global \neconomy is reinforced by present day practices that create \u201eworm holes\u201f which \nact as short cuts for economic flows or \u201crelational inequalities within, \nnetworked spaces\u201d (Sheppard, 2002, p.308). Understanding the diverse way \necologies of mobility are constructed and used in global firms provides one \nway to better understand these inequalities and power relations. \n \nDiscussion \n \nSo far we have argued that developing more nuanced understanding of how \nvirtual and corporeal mobility \u2013 technically mediated communication and \nbusiness travel - cooperate in the operation of global PSFs is an essential \n27 \nresearch task. We have also suggested that understanding the spatiality of \nbusiness travel is significant for studying power relations within global PSFs \nand the global economy more widely. But what are the implications of these \nsuggestions for future research within the social sciences? \n \nIn terms of the need and cues for travel, Urry\u201fs (2003) discussions of the \n\u201eobligations of proximity\u201f can help us begin to frame future discussions of the \ncauses of business travel. Legal obligations (being present in a courtroom), \nobject obligations (being present to sign a contract), obligations to place \n(going to visit a building) and event obligations (presence to attend a meeting \nor watch a presentation) are clear definers of travel when corporeal presence \nis demanded. Yet the point when corporeal mobility rather than virtual mobility \nbecomes essential in relation to such obligations is less clear cut. Returning to \nJones\u201f (2007) typology of when f2f contact is important in PSFs, we might, \ntherefore, ask the following questions:  \n\uf0b7 In relation to knowledge and innovation, how does the use of virtual \nmobility in a project lead to a point when corporeal mobility is \ndemanded?  \n\uf0b7 In relation to the completion of cross-border business, which \npresentations need to be observed and responded to in person and at \nwhich point in a project is such presence essential an video-\nconferencing not enough ?  \n\uf0b7 In relation to organizational control, how does the circulation of memos \nand telephone conference calls lead to the moments when senior and \nmanaging partners feel the need to move to be co-present with their \n28 \ncolleagues, and how does virtual mobility then consolidates any \nbenefits gained from f2f encounter?  \n\uf0b7 How do different forms of business travel, such as that identified by \nMillar and Salt (2008) cooperate in relation to all of the above and get \nused differently depending on the business challenge and with different \neffects on the operation of the firm? \n \nThe question is not, then, what f2f contact does as an isolated event, but how \nf2f contact and business travel fit into and result from the emergence of \nbroader organizational ecologies made up of cooperation between virtual and \ncorporeal mobility? Put another way, where does business travel fit into a \nsequence in which both virtual and corporeal mobility are used? Whilst much \ncan be learned from discussions of f2f encounters and the role of visual cues \nand embodied interactions and the trust this produces (see Urry, 2003), \nexisting theoretical framings don\u201ft allow us to fully identify the point at which \ntravel is invoked and virtual mobility temporarily abandoned. In effect they \ndon\u201ft help us explain how the increasing preponderance to a cooperation \nbetween virtual and corporeal mobility defines the contemporary role of the f2f \nencounter. After all, existing conceptualisations of trust and f2f encounter, the \nwork of Goffman (1967), Boden and Molotoch (1994) and Storper and \nVenables (2004) amongst others, are based on studies f2f encounters in \nisolation, and not as part of a broader ecology of mobility. They tell us what f2f \ncontact does, but not what virtual mobility does to make f2f contact necessary \nor change its role and at which point in a project\u201fs or a relationship\u201fs lifecycle \ncorporeal mobility becomes necessary. So in global PSFs, colleagues in a \n29 \nfirm who have met and worked together before may already trust one-another, \nyet regular virtual co-presences lead to certain moments when they feel the \nneed for further corporeal co-presence outside of legal, object or place \nobligations. Examples of such occasions include annual conferences, away \ndays or weeks, mid-project meetings. Is this a result of the hybrid, socio-\ntechnical organizational spaces that now exist inside global firms?  \n \nThis is not just an issue of academic interest. Better theorising the way the \ncooperation of virtual and corporeal mobility is used in PSFs is becoming \nincreasingly policy relevant as the environmental costs of travel cause more \nand more concern. Worries about corporate carbon footprints figure highly on \nthe agenda of both corporations but also politicians and developing a better \nunderstanding of what spurs corporeal mobility and how the socio-technical \nspace that is the global firm can be better managed to minimise travel would \nseem valuable. The comments of the UK Chairman and Senior Partner of \nKPMG the accounting firm exemplify this dilemma well. He noted that, \u201chalf of \nour carbon footprint is now accounted for by air travel and we can\u201ft quite see \nhow we can deliver services to our international clients without it\u201d (Financial \nTimes, 2007). The questions identified here, whilst advancing understanding \nassociated with the mobilities paradigm more generally, could contribute to \naddressing such important issues as sustainable business travel becomes a \nwatchword for all global firms. \n \nExplicit focus on who travels, from where, to where and how often also have \nbroad implications for future discussions of mobility and its effects. Our sketch \n30 \nof the geographical implications of international business travel (the \nreproduction of power relations in the economy), but also the geographical \ninfluences on travel itself (time and distance as two continually important \nfactors) reveal the importance of studying business travel not as an abstract \ncorporate process, but as a socio-spatial formation. This means it is vital to \ndevelop detailed case studies that compare and contrast the role of short and \nlong-haul international business travel, travel between and within developed \nand developing countries, Western Europe and European Accession States, \nand Asia and North America and Europe. Findings from such research may \nwell be of significance in relation to concerns about uneven development and \nthe power relations associated with the work of TNCs (Dicken et al., 2001; \nCoe, Dicken and Hess, 2008). More widely, increasingly important debates \nabout work-life balance and the tyranny of the travel often viewed as essential \nfor securing promotion in TNCs (Gufstason, 2006) might be enriched by \ndetailed empirical study of business travel and the varying pressure of travel \non different groups in an organization. The concepts of \u201enetwork capital\u201f and \n\u201emotility\u201f might also be further used to draw attention to the significance of who \ntravels in terms of the way gender, race and age affect who gets to travel and \nthe implications of this for individual careers and equality with firms more \ngenerally. In particular, such discussions have implications for equality in that \nthe ability and willingness of workers to travel may have significant impacts on \nthe promotion prospects of certain groups within an organization.  \n \nOf course, the key challenge is to couple ideas about the ecology of mobility \nthat lies behind the operation of global PSFs to questions about how socio-\n31 \nspatial power relations are created, changed and reproduced by the use of \nvirtual mobility and business travel in different sequences and with different \nfrequencies. It is possible to imagine a situation in which greater reliance on \none form of mobility changes the nature of relationships between individuals, \noffices and places. When this means a predominant reliance on virtual forms \nof mobility (email, videoconference, the circulation of documents etc.) this \nseems likely to result in a changed meaning for business travel and differential \npower relations as a result of the format of the ecology of mobility. Such \nquestions clearly need further attention so that we can better understand their \nimplications for the operation of global PSFs.  \n \n \nConclusions: working towards a research agenda \n \nIn this paper we have examined the practice of business travel as \ninternational mobility head-on, considered its role in ecologies of mobility in \nfirms, highlighted the significance of the geography of international business \ntravel flows within and between Europe, and intimated several questions for \nfuture research. In sum, we have made a number of interrelated claims about \nthe necessity (and urgency) of placing the study of international business \ntravel on the geographical agenda.  \n \nFirst, we have suggested that business travel itself deserves more detailed \nattention from academics through in-depth qualitative studies. Further \nresearch on the hyper-mobility and geographies of international business \n32 \ntravel are likely to enhance future work on the mobilities paradigm (Sheller \nand Urry, 2006), knowledge and transient migration studies (Williams, 2007); \nrelational economic geography (Yeung, 2005), the firm (Beaverstock, 2004; \nFaulconbridge, 2007a) and transport studies (Derudder and Witlox, 2005). \nImportantly, though, we have argued that this should be as part of studies of \nthe whole ecology of mobility in firms because business travel and f2f \nmeetings cannot be understood in isolation from other forms of mobility. \n \nIn addition, second, we have suggested that further research would allow \nissues that preoccupy both business and government to be better addressed. \nIndeed, one of our main arguments has been that there is a rich body of work \nthat can help us understand the role of international business travel, yet \nimportant empirical gaps that allow us to fully apply existing theoretical \nframeworks. By highlighting the need to know when people travel, why, where \nthey travel from and to, how this relates to virtual forms of mobility (information \ncommunication technologies etc.) and mobilties\u201f \u201epolitical\u201f impacts more \nbroadly we have attempted to identify a rich research agenda in which further \nstudies can be used to both answer academic questions about business travel \nin the global economy, but also policy questions about strategies for making \nbusiness travel \u201esustainable\u201f.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nJames Faulconbridge acknowledges the support of the British Academy \nthrough grant SG-43996 which funded the collection of data relating to \n33 \narchitecture reported in this paper, the Sloan Foundation, grant B2006-31, \nwhich supported the collection of the advertising data reported and Lancaster \nUniversity which funded collection of the data reported relating to law firms.
