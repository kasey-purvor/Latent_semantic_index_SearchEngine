INTRODUCTION\nTHE EARTH is constantly being bombarded by cosmicradiation of both galactic and solar origin. These particles\nrange in energy up to 10 eV (galactic) with the majority being\nvery high-energy protons [1], [2]. The surface of the earth is\nshielded from these high-energy particles by approximately\n1000 g.cm of air and, as such, this radiation contributes\nless than 10% to the total radiation exposure at sea level [3].\nHowever, this radiation interacts with nitrogen, oxygen and\nother constituent atoms in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere to produce a\nvariety of secondary particles which are often of greater relative\nbiological effectiveness than the primary particles, such as\nneutrons, for example. This phenomenon results in a maximum\nintensity at an altitude of approximately 20 km, known as the\nPfotzer maximum. The cosmic neutron component is assuming\ngreater importance at these altitudes due to the previous\nunderestimation of its relative biological effectiveness [4], [5],\nthe revised recommendations of the International Commission\non Radiological Protection (ICRP) [6], [7] and the European\nUnion requirements for the radiation protection of aircraft\ncrew [8]. These aspects are of specific concern to the air\ntransport industry since longer periods of time are being spent\nin aircraft at ever increasing altitudes. The use of air travel has\nbeen steadily growing for the past 30 years and is currently\nexperiencing 5% growth per year; it is expected that in 20 years\ntime, three times as much traffic will be using air travel [9].\nConsequently, aircraft may spend longer periods of time at\nManuscript received July 25, 2000.

It\nis clear, therefore, that improved radiation monitoring of the\ncosmic environment is of considerable technological interest,\nfrom both academic and commercial perspectives.\nSeveral dosimetry techniques have been recommended [6] for\nuse in the cosmic environment associated with commercial avi-\nation. These include; passive personal devices, such as thermo-\nluminescence dosemeters and etched-track devices; active per-\nsonal devices, including solid-state devices and there is also a\ncomplementary variety of approaches to the improved charac-\nterization of the radiation field. Radiation monitoring on-board\naircraft is well established for research purposes [10]\u2013[15] and\nmonitoring on-board commercial supersonic aircraft has been\nongoing successfully for more than 20 years [16], [17]. How-\never, the equipment used in the latter is antiquated in compar-\nison with current design approaches.\nIn this paper, we report on a selection of new measurements\nconcerning electronic dosimetry systems in the cosmic neutron\nenvironment associated with high-altitude air travel. These\nsystems span the sensitivity extremes possible with modern\ndosimetry approaches and comprise:\n\u2022 boron-implanted large-geometry MOSFET devices, sup-\nplemented by a variety of hydrogenous layers;\n\u2022 a pair of polythene-moderated proportional counters aug-\nmented by copper\/lead shells.\nWe present the first measurements of the response of high-\nsensitivity MOSFETs to a cosmic neutron reference field, which\nis compared to the more familiar response of two proportional\ncounter designs.\nII. BACKGROUND\nThe sensitivity of MOS transistors to radiation is well-estab-\nlished and is manifest as the change in threshold ( ), or flat-\nband voltage ( ), in response to radiation exposure [18]. In the\npast, MOS transistors have been referred to as the Space-Charge\ntransducer, the MOS dosimeter [19] and, most often, as the\nRadFET (RADiation Field Effect Transistor) [20]. The mecha-\nnism by which MOS transistors respond to radiation is through\ncharge- and interface-state build-up in the gate oxide (SiO ).\nDevices based on the pMOS process exhibit greater change in\nthreshold or flatband voltage characteristics, as the contribution\nof both interface states and charge build-up is in the same, neg-\native direction. It has been observed that nMOS devices can ex-\nhibit rebound where the two contributing factors cancel each\nother out with either no overall change, or with a positive change\n(increase) being observed [21].\n0018\u20139499\/00$10.00 \u00a9 2000 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Greatly\nimproved -ray sensitivity has been reported on MOS devices\nsince these measurements, due to process optimization [23],\ntemperature compensation [24] and multidevice stacking [25],\n[26].\nThe response of MOS devices to mixed fields has been\nstudied comparatively little, with reported neutron sensitivities\nfor bare devices of 65 mV\/Gy(Si) [27]. Indeed, the neutron\ninsensitivity has often been the basis for the use of these devices\nin discriminating the -component of a mixed field [28]. More\nrecently, hydrogenous material has been used to sensitize\nMOS devices to neutrons [29], heralding the devices as suitable\nsolid-state bases for mixed-field personal dose measurement for\nmilitary personnel. Complementary measurements have been\nundertaken for medical applications that compare the potential\nof MOSFETs for combined macro- and micro-dosimetry,\nexploiting water to produce secondary protons [30]. We are\nnot aware of any previous attempts to measure neutron dose\nwith the high-sensitivity MOSFETs used in this work, nor are\nwe aware of any attempts to assess the rationale of using hy-\ndrogenous converters to sensitize any MOSFET devices to the\ncosmic environment where the sensitivity of these is likely to\nbe different. Conversely, neutron field characterization has long\nbeen undertaken with systems based on proportional counters\n[31] in combination with hydrogenous moderators. The energy\nresponse of these instruments can be extended for the cosmic\nenvironment by the incorporation of high- materials into\nthe moderator [32], [35] to promote reactions of fast\nneutrons. Bonner sphere sets have been developed and mod-\neled on this basis for the spectroscopy of cosmic fields [36].\nThus, design optimization remains the focus of much research\nregarding the inevitable compromise of detection sensitivity,\nphysical size\/mass and manufacturing simplicity demanded by\ncommercial instruments based on this technology.\nIII. EXPERIMENTAL\nIn total, eighteen MOS devices were irradiated at the CERN\nReference Field Facility (CERF). Seven of these devices were\nion-implanted with boron, in order to adjust the threshold\nvoltage therefore minimizing power source requirements and,\nfurther, to optimize radiation sensitivity. This latter optimiza-\ntion is due to an increase in hole-traps introduced to the oxide\nby the ion-implantation process. A number of the devices tested\nhad the surface of the silicon wafer covered with layers of\npolyethene of different thicknesses to promote reactions\nwith the high-energy neutrons and thus enhance the device\nresponse to the neutron component of the radiation field. The\nthickness of the layers applied was based upon stopping-power\ndata for protons in polyethene [37]. Layers of 1\u20133 mm were\nchosen to suit the proton energies expected following elastic\ninteractions with the very high-energy neutrons involved [38].\nThe MOS devices used in this work were fabricated by\nthe National Microelectronics Research Centre (NMRC) in\nCork, Ireland. The NMRC devices are pMOS transistors with\na thermal 400 nm silicon dioxide layer grown at 1000 C\nFig. 1. Cross-sectional view of both polythene-moderated proportional\ncounters.\n[39]. The devices tested have a gate geometry of 300\/50 m\n(width\/length). The processing of these devices has been\noptimized to provide radiation softness and so represents the\nbest case for a radiation dosimeter or, alternatively, the worst\ncase for an operational MOS device used in cosmic fields as an\navionic component.\nThe devices were all irradiated with a gate bias of 5 V\nand all other connections grounded; this creates a 1.25 MV\/cm\nfield across the gate oxide. This field reduces hole-electron\nrecombination in SiO and enhances hole-trapping within the\noxide, thereby providing a greater threshold voltage shift. The\nthreshold voltage of these devices was recorded pre-, mid- and\npost-irradiation in the user area at CERF. The time incurred\nbetween exposure and reading of the devices was a maximum\nof a few minutes.\nThe extended rem counter system, also tested at CERF,\nconsisted of two, 208 mm diameter polyethylene moderating\nspheres with a central shell of either i) an inner layer of lead\nsurrounded by a shell of cadmium or ii) an inner layer of copper.\nBoth of these designs were undertaken to exploit the\nreaction of fast neutrons. Copper was chosen as an alternative\nto lead because it is easier to machine and generally less\nhazardous. In this case, the cadmium surround was removed\nin order to adjust the fenestration ratio which was judged to\nbe potentially detrimental due to the exclusion of thermalized\ncosmic neutrons from the central counter. The central detectors\nin these effectively-modified Leake [31] arrangements are\nSP9 He counters at 2 atm. pressure. The instruments have\nintegrated electronic support, comprising high-voltage supply\nand pre-amplification. Data were taken, via bespoke DC-2\ndata-logger devices developed and supplied by John Caunt\nScientific, Oxford, UK. Data were downloaded and processed\nvia RS-232 interface to a PC after the tests. The cross section\nof both detectors is given in Fig. 1.\nSince 1993, high-energy stray radiation fields have been\navailable at CERN [40], Geneva. The Reference Field Facility,\ninstalled at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerator,\ncan provide reference fields similar to those found at flying\naltitudes of 10\u201315 km. The reference field is created by bom-\nbarding a copper target, 7 cm in diameter and 50 cm in length\nwith a beam of positive or negative hadrons with a momentum\nof either 120 GeV\/c or 205 GeV\/c. The reference field is\nlocated at 90 to the beam of hadrons, behind an 80 cm shield\nof concrete. The areal mass similarity between the atmospheric\nair layer above 10\u201315 km and the concrete shield reproduces\nthe cosmic neutron energy distribution, as shown by Fig. 2.

This creates\na near-uniform radiation field over a 4 m area above the\nconcrete shield, which is sub-divided into sixteen numbered\nsub-areas, 0.25 m in size. A precision ion chamber (PIC)\npresent at the facility is used to count the number of particles\nper pulse, which can be converted to dose based on a known\ncalibration, according to both ICRP 21 and 60 [42], [43].\nIV. RESULTS\nThe MOSFETs and the extended rem counters were placed\nin the field for three, eight-hour periods. The total dose received\nby each of the locations over the twenty-four hours is detailed in\nTable I. These data were obtained from reference values mea-\nsured previously with the HANDI TEPC [43] for each of the\nsub-areas.\nThe threshold voltages ( ) before, during and after irradia-\ntion for the nonimplanted MOSFETs are shown in Fig. 3 and\nfor the implanted devices in Fig. 4. The count response of the\nspherical detectors is compared in Fig. 5, in terms of cumula-\ntive counts versus time for an eight-hour shift. There are a few\nflat spots in these data due to occasional beam down-time of the\nbeam during this particular shift. In Fig. 6, the time scale is ex-\npanded to show the detector response to the short-period pulsed\ncharacter of the field at CERF. From these data, the count sen-\nsitivity has been determined, as given in Table II.\nV. DISCUSSION\nThe data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 demonstrate that a\nchange in threshold voltage has not been observed for the MOS\ndevices. It is however noted that there appears to be slight\ninconsistency between the readings for MOSFETs 58\u201361,\nwhich is not exhibited by the ion-implanted devices, for which\nFig. 3. Threshold voltage measurements for nonimplanted MOSFETs.\nFig. 4. Threshold voltage measurements for ion implanted MOSFETs.\nFig. 5. Response of proportional counters during 8-h exposure.\nfurther investigation is required. Some of the devices, such\nas MOS176, MOS177 and MOS181, exhibit trends that are\nconsistent with the small threshold change expected. However,\nother devices contradict this observation and the data are\ntherefore inconclusive.\nIt is clearly ambitious to expect a large MOSFET response\nfor such low doses whilst previous investigations of neutron\nfields with MOSFET dosimeters [28], [29] have often used\nmuch higher-dose, lower-energy sources than those attempted\nin this work. In this respect, fading might be expected to\nbe comparable with any low-level response. Fading of the\nradiation response in MOSFETs is well-known to be smallest\nfor devices in which the oxide is thickest and decreases with\nincrease in gate voltage [44]\u2013[46].

Response of proportional counters over a short duration.\nTABLE II\nCOUNT SENSITIVITY FOR THE EXTENDED REM COUNTERS\nwork were of average thickness and the gate voltage used is\ntypical of that used for similar studies of higher-dose -ray\nenvironments. However, the duration over which annealing is\noften observed is much longer (several hours) than the time\ndelay incurred between exposure and reading in this work,\nespecially at ambient temperatures. The fading phenomenon\nis due to the conflicting effect of increases in interface trap\ndensity and decreases in gate-oxide charge density [47], [48].\nThese often cancel each other in the early stages of annealing,\nsuggesting minimal fading of the response over the time-scales\nand ambient temperatures involved in this work.\nDevice sensitivity for the MOSFETs used in this paper is\nin the 100 mV\/Sv range for -radiation. This indicates a mea-\nsurement requirement of V resolution for the doses adminis-\ntered in this research. This is feasible with the equipment used\nfor current measurement but is smaller than the fluctuations\ncaused by drift. Compensation of the temperature-based com-\nponent of this drift is unlikely to result in the large increase\nin signal-to-noise ratio necessary to decipher a small effect. A\nmuch more attractive route is to increase the gate bias and em-\nploy the on-chip multi-MOSFET stacking approach which has\nbeen shown to increase sensitivity by factors in excess of two\nhundred [25], [26], [39] over that of a single device.\nThe data for the spherical detectors indicate that copper has\npotential as a replacement for lead as the high- con-\nverter. The data in this work exhibit a greater sensitivity for\nthe copper-based design. However, it must be emphasized that\nthis design was tested without the cadmium thermal shield and\nsuch increased sensitivity could be indicative of the character-\nistic thermal over-response to which this type of detector is often\nprone. This is especially relevant because of the large thermal\ncomponent of the CERF field above the concrete shield. To de-\ntermine whether this is the case, a complete energy response\nstudy is necessary as has been demonstrated comprehensively\nfor the lead design [34]. Greater insight into the dose-response\ncharacteristic of this detector design is possible via Monte Carlo\nmodeling in order to optimize the detector dimensions.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we have reported the first attempt at cosmic\nneutron detection in large-geometry MOSFET devices; both\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

These data have been contrasted\nto the responses of two designs of the extended-range neutron\nrem counter. In summary, the MOSFET devices have been\nshown to be too insensitive for cosmic neutron dosimetry in\ntheir present form despite the enhancements described above.\nMore research is necessary to investigate alternative methods\nof sensitivity increase in these devices.\nThe measurements with the extended rem counters demon-\nstrate a good count response, consistent with the considerable\nprior-art in this aspect of the study. They demonstrate that\ncopper has potential as a replacement for lead with the consid-\nerable benefits this has for detector manufacturing practices.\nHowever, more research is necessary to elucidate the energy\nresponse and degree of likely over-response in the thermal\nregion for these counters.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank B.
