INTRODUCTION\nNuclei in the A \u2248 180 region exhibit axially symmetric\nprolate deformations in their ground state. The low-lying\nexcited states of these nuclei are therefore characterized by\ncollective rotational bands. Furthermore, near their respective\nFermi levels, both protons and neutrons have available high-j\norbitals with large projections (\u0003) along the symmetry axis.\nThis stimulates competition along the yrast line between\ncollective angular momentum perpendicular to the symmetry\naxis and particle angular momentum aligned along the sym-\nmetry axis. The interplay and changing dominance between\ncollective and noncollective modes of excitations as a function\n*Present address: Department of Physics and Astronomy,\nMississippi State University, Mississippi State, Mississippi 39762,\nUSA.\n\u2020Present address: Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Kolkata\n700064, India.\n\u2021Corresponding author: partha chowdhury@uml.edu.\n\u00a7Present address: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,\nLivermore, California 94551, USA.\n\u2016Present address: Hahn-Meitner-Institute, Glienicker Strasse 100,\nD-14109 Berlin, Germany\nof angular momentum remains a key focus of nuclear structure\ninvestigations.\nHafnium (Z = 72) nuclei have long been considered to be\nprototypical systems for the observation of these competing\neffects. The motivation for the present study of neutron-rich\nhafnium nuclei is twofold. Our recent investigations of these\nnuclei [1,2] have focused on the population and decay of\nhigh-K isomers (K = \u0004i\u0003i), corroborating earlier theoretical\npredictions [3] that multiquasiparticle excitations would be\nincreasingly favored in neutron-rich isotopes. Interestingly,\nother theoretical calculations predict a transition from prolate\nto oblate shapes along the yrast line at higher spins [4,5]\nfor these same neutron-rich hafnium nuclei. Since the only\ndata collected in our earlier experiments were between beam\npulses, all collective excitations observed were those that were\nfed via isomer decays and not those directly populated in\nthe reactions. An additional motivation was to complement\nour earlier work on multiquasiparticle isomers by a careful\ncharacterization of previously bypassed two-quasiparticle\nlow-K rotational structures, which form the building blocks of\nthe high-K excitations. The present work focuses specifically\non the experimental identification and characterization of\ncollective structures in 180,182Hf. The new results extend the\nexperimental information in these nuclei to significantly higher\n0556-2813\/2007\/75(3)\/034305(14) 034305-1 \u00a92007 The American Physical Society\nE.

Both rotational and vibrational structures exhibit\nunusual characteristics at high spin. A detailed analysis of\nthe extended systematics of quasiparticle alignments in these\nneutron-rich systems has been performed, and results are\ndiscussed within the framework of cranked Woods-Saxon\ncalculations.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nPopulating high-spin states in neutron-rich nuclei in this\nmass region is experimentally challenging. Fusion-evaporation\ntechniques fail, since stable beam-target combinations tend\nto preferentially form fused systems on the neutron-deficient\nside of the valley of stability. The relatively new technique of\nutilizing inelastic and transfer reactions with heavy beams\n[6] has proved to be quite effective in our recent studies\n[1,2]. In the present work, excited states in 180,182Hf were\npopulated with a 750 MeV 136Xe beam, incident on a thin\n180Hf target (410 \u00b5g\/cm2, isotopic purity > 94%) backed by a\n40 \u00b5g\/cm2 carbon foil. The beam (\u2248 15% above the Coulomb\nbarrier) was provided by the 88-in. cyclotron at the Lawrence\nBerkeley National Laboratory. Emitted \u03b3 rays were detected\nby the GAMMASPHERE (GS) array consisting of 100 large-\nvolume Compton-suppressed high-purity germanium (HPGe)\ndetectors. The excited nuclei were allowed to recoil out of the\nthin target into vacuum, with a well-defined velocity measured\nby their time of flight. The beamlike and targetlike fragments\nwere detected and identified with CHICO, a position-sensitive\nparallel-plate avalanche counter [7]. The master trigger was\nthe coincident detection of at least two \u03b3 rays in GS and\ntwo correlated particles in CHICO. With a beam intensity\naveraging 2.5 pnA, approximately 5.3 \u00d7 108 raw events were\ncollected.\nThe measurements of position and time-of-flight difference\nwith CHICO were used to distinguish between beamlike and\ntargetlike fragments following inelastic excitation or transfer.\nThe measured velocity and angle were used to reconstruct the\nparticle kinematics event by event, and the prompt transitions\nemitted by nuclei decaying in flight were corrected for\nDoppler shifts (Fig. 1). The events were sorted with the TSCAN\nsoftware package [8] into coincident two-dimensional matrices\nand three-dimensional cubes. The matrices and cubes were\nanalyzed, and level schemes constructed using the ESCL8R and\nLEVIT8R programs in the RADWARE package [9].\nThe method of directional angular correlations from ori-\nented states (DCO) [10,11] was applied to establish the\nmultipolarity of transitions and assign level spins for the\ncollective bands observed in the inelastic channel 180Hf. A\nmatrix was constructed with \u03b3 rays detected at 90\u25e6 \u00b1 10\u25e6 with\nrespect to the direction of the emitting recoils on one axis and\nthose detected at 30\u25e6\/150\u25e6 \u00b1 10\u25e6 with respect to the particle\ndirections on the other. The experimental DCO ratio RDCO(\u03b3 )\nof a \u03b3 transition was calculated as\nRDCO(\u03b3 ) = I\u03b3 (30\n\u25e6\/150\u25e6, 90\u25e6)\nI\u03b3 (90\u25e6, 30\u25e6\/150\u25e6)\n, (1)\nwhere I\u03b3 (\u03b81, \u03b82) is the intensity of the \u03b3 transition observed\nat an angle \u03b81, in coincidence with a stretched E2 transition\n0 500 1000 1500\n0\n2\n4\n(c)73164\n354\n74\n43\n33\n221\n5\n93\nCorrection for Hf\nE\u03b3 (keV)\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\nx 106\n13\n13\nCorrection for Xe\nC\nou\nnt\ns\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n(b)\n(a)\nNo Doppler Correction\nFIG. 1.

RESULTS\nA. Band structures in 180Hf\nThe level scheme of 180Hf deduced from the present work\nis shown in Fig. 2. Energies, relative \u03b3 -ray intensities, and the\nproposed multipolarity assignments for the observed \u03b3 rays\nare presented in Table I. Intensities were normalized to 1000\nfor the 332-keV 6+ \u2192 4+ transition. The spin alignment of\na nucleus excited through a binary reaction above Coulomb\nbarrier energies is complex, and systematic variations in the\nDCO ratios were observed for nonsuccessive transitions in\na cascade. For successive transitions in a cascade, with a\nstretched E2 transition in the ground state band as one of\nthe gating transitions, values of RDCO are observed to cluster\naround the expected values of 1.0 and 0.5 for stretched\nquadrupole and dipole transitions, respectively. Measured\nDCO ratios, using this prescription, are included in the table\nfor all clean \u03b3 rays that are statistically significant and help\nin assigning spins and parities to observed band structures.\nWhile the statistical uncertainties are small, measuring angles\nwith respect to the recoil direction leads to different Doppler\nbroadening at the two chosen angle bins, as well as event-\nby-event variations in the detection efficiencies, depending\non how many detectors make the particular angle bin. These\nnormalization uncertainties limited the DCO ratios that could\nbe extracted from the data. For nonstretched and mixed-\nmultipolarity transitions, other complementary information\nneeded to be also considered for final spin assignments.\n034305-2\nCOLLECTIVE ROTATION AND VIBRATION IN NEUTRON- . . .

This band was known only up to I\u03c0 = 12+\nprior to this work [12] and has been extended to 18+. The\n869-keV \u03b3 ray, the highest transition placed in the GSB, is\nclearly observed in the spectrum double-gated on the 731- and\n808-keV transitions. The rapid drop in the transition intensities\nprevented the observation of any higher-lying excited state.\nThe measured DCO ratios of the stretched quadrupole GSB\ntransitions range between 0.98 and 1.16.\n2. Bands 1 and 2\nBands 1 and 2 are signature partners built on the\n1141-keV I\u03c0 = 8\u2212 isomeric state (t1\/2 = 5.5 hr). Low-lying\nstates of bands 1 and 2 were known from previous out-of-beam\ndecay spectroscopy [1]. These have been extended from 12\u2212\nto 16\u2212 and from 11\u2212 to 17\u2212, respectively, with six new \u0007I =\n1 transitions between the signature partners (Fig. 4). The band\nintensities were \u223c1.5% of the strongest GSB transition.\n3. Bands 3 and 4\nBands 3 and 4, signature partners built on a 1702-keV\nbandhead, were observed previously [13,14] and assigned\na tentative spin-parity of 6+ for the bandhead. The bands\nwere identified in the present study without extension. The\npreviously observed dominance of the \u0007I = 1 transition\nintensities over the \u0007I = 2 transition intensities in the band\nis corroborated (Fig. 5). The overall \u03b3 -ray intensity of these\nbands is less than 0.5% of the strongest GSB transition.\nWhile the bandhead had been determined previously to be\nisomeric, no noticeable difference in coincident intensities\nacross the bandhead was observed on varying the width\nof the coincidence time window. This suggests an upper\nlimit of \u223c5 ns (the time resolution of the detectors) for the\nhalf-life of the bandhead. It was not possible to extract reliable\nDCO ratios for the 1062- and 1394-keV transitions from\nthe isomeric bandhead to the 6+ and 4+ states of the GSB.\nNevertheless, the absence of a decay branch to the 2+ state of\nthe GSB limits the possible spin of the bandhead to 5 or 6.\nFurthermore, the isomeric nature of the low-lying bandhead,\nwhich necessarily implies a two-quasiparticle configuration\n61702\n82112\n102616\n123193\n41374\n61612\n81937\n102349\n122847\n00\n81141\n101652\n122262\n5 1482\n7 1764\n9 2133\n11 2587\n13 3122\n7 1894\n9 2353\n11 2898\n9 1384\n11 1945\n143431\n164090\n15 3733\n17 4412\n5 1557\n13 2603\n15 3350\n142965\n(6 ) 1901\n6 1658\n4 1408\n293\n4308\n6640\n81083\n101630\n122273\n143004\n163812\n184681\n7 1928\n9 2398\n11 2959\n13 3605\n6 1723\n8 2132\n10 2612\n(8 ) 2272\n(10 ) 2729\n(12 ) 3299\n(14 ) 3970\n8 2046\n10 2531\n12 3109\n14 3780\n3 1291\n2 1199\n4 1370\n2 1183\n0 1102\n163755\n17 4180\n12 3128\n14 3676\n1903\n2300\n2795\n3383\n16 4268\n410\n504\n498\n412\n325\n238\n610\n511\n577\n282\n369\n454\n535\n459\n545\n295\n282\n263\n241\n218\n561\n317\n293\n268\n243\n584\n659\n611\n679\n658\n747\n703\n385\n362\n341\n93\n215\n332\n443\n547\n643\n731\n808\n869\n371\n470\n562\n646\n315\n409\n371\n457\n570\n671\n388\n485\n578\n671\n58\n209\n288\n187\n790\n830\n425\n405\n515\n548\n480\n266\n192\n1065\n1062\n1394\n501\n776\n836\n902\n963\n1018\n1350\n1498\n983\n1530\n1050\n1493\n1083\n1415\n1100\n1315\n1106\n1332\n1330\n1315\n845\n1288\n916\n1249\n983\n1198\n966\n1026\n1098\n1189\n1261\n397\n495\n588\n1263\n1217\n1165\n(1110)597\n687\n767\n1669\n1404\n592\n216\n196\n173\n152\n130\n108\n5.5h\n0.57 s\n180Hf\n1 2 3 4 5 6 GSB 7 8 9 10 11\n< 5ns\nFIG. 2.

Bands 7 and 8\nBands 7 and 8 were previously reported as signature\npartners of a K\u03c0 = 2+, \u03b3 -vibrational band [12,16,17]. Only\nthe two lowest levels of each band (2+ at 1199 keV and\n4+ at 1408 keV for band 7, and 3+ at 1291 keV and 5+\nat 1557 keV for band 8) were known prior to this study. In\nthis work, these bands were observed up to I\u03c0 = 13+ and\n14+, respectively.

Clean coincidence\nconditions, however, can simplify the spectra even in the\npresence of such unusual background features. For example,\ndifferences of spectra double-gated on consecutive ground\nstate band members are able to separate out specific subsets\nof \u03b3 rays which directly feed the different levels in the ground\nstate band (Fig. 7).\nFor band 7, the DCO ratios of 1.01\u20131.07 for the 1415-,\n1493-, 1530-, and 1498-keV transitions, which depopulate\nthe newly observed higher-lying members of the band to the\n4+, 6+, and 8+ members of the GSB, are consistent with \u0007I =\n2 assignments. Together with \u0007I = 1 transitions depopulating\nthe band 7 members (1083 and 1050 keV, with DCO ratios of\n0.72 and 0.69, respectively), the even-spin and positive-parity\nassignment for the bandhead is robust and consistent with\nprevious firm spin-parity assignments to the low-spin members\nof this band from different measurement techniques [12,17].\nFor band 8, DCO ratios for the transitions depopulating the\nhigher band members to corresponding GSB members indicate\n\u0007I = 1 stretched dipole character (0.62 for both the 1288- and\n1315-keV transitions depopulating the 1928- and 2398-keV\nlevels, respectively). These values are consistent with odd-spin\nassignments for the band members, and agree with previous\nspin-parity assignments of 3+ and 5+, respectively, for the\n1291- and 1557-keV levels. The low intensity of the in-band\nE2 transitions in both bands 7 and 8 preclude DCO ratio\nmeasurements.\nFIG. 8. Excitation energy as a function of I (I + 1) for K\u03c0 =\n0+, 2+ bands.\n6. Band 9\nThe assignments of spin and parity for band 9 are based\non a measured DCO ratio of 1.05 for the 1018-keV transition\nto the 4+ member of the GSB, which suggests either an E2\nmultipolarity or an unstretched I \u2192 I transition. The latter is\npreferred, since the E2 choice would make the 1658-keV level\nan I\u03c0 = 8+ state, forcing the 1350-keV branch from this state\nto the 4+ state of the GSB to be an improbable E4 transition.\nThe five other transitions from this band to other members\nof the GSB were too weak for any complementary DCO\ninformation. With the 1018-keV transition as an unstretched\ndipole, the 1658-keV level is assigned a spin-parity of 6+,\nwith stretched quadrupole character for the higher in-band\ntransitions. With this assignment, the excitation energies as\na function of I (I + 1) for this band fit smoothly to those of\na band previously reported [12] up to a 1370-keV I\u03c0 = 4+\nlevel, built on the first excited (I\u03c0 ,K) = (0+, 0) state (Fig. 8).\nBand 9, therefore, is considered to be an extension of the earlier\nband built on an excited 0+ state, which has been observed up\nto I\u03c0 = 14+ in this work.\n7. Band 10\nBand 10 is reported for the first time. DCO ratios were\ndifficult to measure for the transitions in this weak band.\nThe strongest decay out from the bottom of the band is a\n1261-keV \u03b3 ray, the energy of which is within 2 keV of a\nsimilar decay out from the bottom of band 11. The decay\nfrom the lowest observed 1901-keV level of this band to\nthe 6+ member of the GSB, together with similar decays\nfrom the higher members of the band to the corresponding\nhigher members of the GSB, suggests a typical E2 sequence\nconnecting members of the band. The 3299-keV level of this\nband is seen to have three decay branches, two to the 12+ and\n10+ levels of the GSB and one to the 10+ level of band 7, the\neven-spin sequence of the \u03b3 -vibrational band. This narrows\nthe possible spin of the 3299-keV level to either 11 or 12,\nwith a consequent spin of either 9 or 10 for the immediately\nlower 2729-keV level of this band. A spin assignment of 10\nfor the 2729-keV level is arrived at from the observation of\n034305-7\nE. NGIJOI-YOGO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 034305 (2007)\na 597-keV decay branch to the 2132-keV 8+ level of band\n7. The only measurable DCO ratio of 0.91 for the 1098-keV\ntransition connecting the 2729-keV level of this band to the 10+\nlevel of the GSB is consistent with that expected for an I \u2192\nI transition. While the above information may seem inad-\nequate for firm spin-parity assignments for this band, the\ninteractions of this band with band 7, the even-spin signature\nbranch of the \u03b3 -vibrational band, as discussed in the following\nsection, strongly supports the tentative assignments of even\nspins and positive parity for this band. The strong depopulation\nof the band to the GSB makes it difficult to ascertain if\nthe bandhead is reached at the lowest levels observed in the\nsequence, but it is suggestive of a low-K vibrational character.\n8. Band 11\nBand 11 is also observed for the first time. Strong out-of-\nband transitions to the GSB, similar to band 10, are again\nsuggestive of low-K vibrational character. As mentioned\nabove, DCO ratios were difficult to measure for bands 10 and\n11, especially since the strongest decays from the bottom of\ntheir respective sequences consist of a closely spaced doublet\nwith energies of 1261 and 1263 keV, populating the 6+ state\nof the GSB. The 1263-keV transition depopulating the lowest\nobserved 1903-keV level of band 11 is stronger than the\n1261-keV transition depopulating band 10. The absence of\ntwo decay branches from any of the levels in this band to\nconsecutive even-spin members of the GSB suggests odd spins\nfor the members of band 11, but the experimental information\nis inadequate for further discussion of this band.\nB. Band structures in 182Hf\nThe level scheme of 182Hf deduced from the present\nwork is shown in Fig. 9, where eight new transitions have\nbeen assigned. Figure 10 shows a spectrum of the GSB,\nobtained from the sum of double-gated coincidences. The\nGSB, previously known up to I\u03c0 = 8+ [1], has been extended\nto I\u03c0 = 18+ at 4733 keV. The rotational band built on the\n1173-keV I\u03c0 = 8\u2212 isomeric state (t1\/2 = 61.5 min) has been\nextended from 12\u2212 to 14\u2212.

Bands 3 and 4\nBands 3 and 4 are built on the 1702-keV I\u03c0 = 6+ level.\nThere are two possible low-lying configurations for an I\u03c0 =\n6+ state, \u03c02[404] 72\n+ \u2297 [402] 52\n+\nand \u03bd2[514] 72\n\u2212 \u2297 [512] 52\n\u2212\n.\nThe excitation energies for the two configurations are very\nsimilar. The experimental alignments lie in between the values\nexpected for the two configurations at the lower rotational\nfrequencies (Fig. 11). The experimental M1\/E2 branching\nratios (Fig. 12), however, result in a | gK\u2212gR\nQ0\n| value of 0.09(1)\n(Table III). The corresponding calculated values are 0.04 and\n0.10 for \u03bd2[514] 72\n\u2212 \u2297 [512] 52\n\u2212\nand \u03c02[404] 72\n+ \u2297 [402] 52\n+\n,\nrespectively. It should be noted that alignment information\non proton orbitals was only available from the higher-Z\nTa neighbor, since very little band structure information is\nknown in the lower-Z Lu neighbor. The alignment values\nare also somewhat sensitive to the Harris parameters. More\nemphasis is placed on the g-factor measurements, which\nfavor the \u03c02[404] 72\n+ \u2297 [402] 52\n+\nconfiguration assignment, in\nagreement with earlier work [13], where the assignment is\nshown to fit the energy and alignment systematics of this\ntwo-quasiproton excitation in the neighboring lighter hafnium\nisotopes very well. Nevertheless, the possibility of admixtures\nof the neutron configuration mentioned above cannot be\nentirely ruled out.\n3. Bands 5 and 6\nBands 5 and 6, built on the 1374-keV I\u03c0 = 4\u2212 level, were\npreviously assigned as signature partners of the configuration\n\u03bd2[624] 92\n+\u2297 [510] 12\n\u2212 [13]. This is the configuration with the\nhighest alignment observed in 180Hf (Fig. 11). Again, the\nexperimental alignments agree well with values expected for\nthis configuration. The extracted | gK\u2212gR\nQ0\n| value of 0.3(1) from\nthe measured in-band branching ratios (Fig. 12) agrees very\nwell with the expected value of 0.4 for this configuration\n(Table III). Although the maximum spin for this configuration\nis I\u03c0 = 5\u2212, residual spin-spin interactions are estimated to\nfavor the Imax \u2212 1 state by \u223c300 keV. Multiquasiparticle cal-\nculations including spin-spin residual interactions reproduce\nthe excitation energy of this state within \u223c30 keV. Energy\nconsiderations exclude the choice of a [521] 12\n\u2212\norbital over the\n[510] 12\n\u2212\norbital, both of which result in an identical g factor.\nThe latter is expected to be the lower energy configuration in\nthis nucleus, since it lies \u223c240 keV lower in 179Hf and is the\nground state in the 181Hf nucleus. The spin-spin interactions\ninvolving the [521] 12\n\u2212\norbital leading to a 4\u2212 level would also\nbe energetically unfavorable.\nC. Quadrupole vibrational bands and low-K structures in 180Hf\nBands 7, 8, and 9 have the characteristics of one-phonon\nvibrational excitations. Multiple decays are observed in 180Hf\nfrom higher-lying states in bands 7, 8, and 9 to levels in the\nground state band (Fig. 2) over an extended range of spin.\nIn addition, the locus of level energies of these bands as a\nfunction of I (I + 1) is approximately parallel to that of the\nGSB, demonstrating very similar effective moments of inertia\n(Fig. 8). These are characteristic signatures of vibrational\nexcitations. Bands 7 and 8, built on a 2+ state, are signature\npartners and have the characteristics of a \u03b3 -vibrational band,\nwhile band 9, built on a 0+2 state, is characterized as a quasi-\u03b2\nband, since an accurate characterization of \u03b2 bands is difficult\n[26].\nThe robustness of the \u03b3 -vibrational band up to spin 10 was\ninvestigated by comparing measured branching ratios of the\ntransitions linking the \u03b3 band to the GSB with Alaga intensity\nrules [27,28].

As shown in Table IV,\nthe experimental branching ratios for bands 7 and 8 are in\nfair agreement with the Alaga predictions, supporting their\nassignment as signature partners of the \u03b3 band.\nAbove spin 10, a strong odd-even staggering or signature\nsplitting for the \u03b3 band in 180Hf is observed. This is highlighted\nin Fig. 13(a), in which the staggering index S(I ), defined\nas [29]\nS(I, I \u2212 1, I \u2212 2) = 2(EI \u2212 EI\u22121) \u2212 (EI \u2212 EI\u22122)\nE(2+1 )\n(6)\n(where EI is the excitation energy of the \u03b3 -band level with\nangular momentum I), is plotted as a function of I . A\ndramatic increase in the staggering is observed as a function\nof increasing spin in 180Hf. This behavior is contrasted with\nthe neighboring 178Hf nucleus, in which the \u03b3 band has\nalso been recently extended to high spins [30], and a small\nodd-even staggering is observed to stay fairly constant up to\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\nx 103 (b) -band mixing and signature splitting\n Band 7 ( -even)\n Band 8 ( -odd)\n Band 10\nE\nI -\n (\n11\n.5\n) \nI(\nI+\n1)\n (\nke\nV\n)\nI(I+1)\n4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4 (a) Odd-even staggering \nin -vibrational bands\nS\n(I\n,I\n-1\n,I\n-2\n)\nI( )\n180Hf\n178Hf\nFIG. 13.

While typical discussions of odd-even staggering in\n\u03b3 -vibrational bands revolve around possibilities of \u03b3 softness\nor triaxiality, there seems to be a rather straightforward\nexplanation in this particular case, arising from the mixing of\nthe even-spin signature of the band with another at intermediate\nspins, with an interchange of character at the highest spins\nobserved. This is illustrated in Fig. 13(b), where the energies\nof bands 7 and 8 (the \u03b3 -band members of even and odd spin,\nrespectively) are compared with those of band 10 as a function\nof I (I + 1) with an arbitrary rigid-rotor reference subtracted.\nSuch plots highlight deviations from smooth behavior that\nare typically indicative of band interactions. The interaction\nbetween bands 7 and 10 is evident from this plot. The\nobservation of two transitions from consecutive members of\nband 10 to the 8+ and 10+ levels of the \u03b3 -vibrational band\nsolidifies the evidence for the mixing scenario and provides\nadditional support and consistency to the tentative spin and\nparity assignments for this band. The observation of the\n1669-keV transition from the 3299-keV level of band 10\nto the 10+ level of the GSB lends further credence to this\ninterpretation. The proposed explanation of the \u201capparent\u201d\nsignature splitting of the \u03b3 -vibrational band, therefore, is that\nthe even-spin signature of the band crosses, interacts, and\nchanges character with a low-K two-quasiparticle band around\nspin 10. Microscopic analyses can point to the dominance of\nspecific two-quasiparticle components in the structure of the \u03b3 -\nvibrational wave function. Early calculations for this nucleus\nwithin the framework of the Nilsson model [31] ascribe 81%\nof the \u03b3 -vibrational wave function to neutrons, with contribu-\ntions from the \u03bd2[514] 72\n\u2212 \u2297 [512] 32\n\u2212\n, \u03bd2[510] 12\n\u2212 \u2297 [512] 32\n\u2212\n,\nand \u03bd2[510] 12\n\u2212 \u2297 [512] 52\n\u2212\nconfigurations dominating with\n27%, 27%, and 23%, respectively.\nD. Crossing frequencies and shape evolution in 180,182Hf\nOne of the more interesting results from the present data of\nrotational excitations in 180Hf and 182Hf is the observation of\na significantly higher alignment frequency of the first nucleon\npairs in both nuclei, compared with the lighter even-N isotopes\n[Fig. 14(a)]. While the N = 90\u2013106 isotopes exhibit a first\ncrossing at a frequency h\u00af\u03c9<\u223c0.3 MeV, almost no gain in\nalignment is observed for 180,182Hf up to h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.43 MeV.\nDelayed alignments have experimentally been observed in the\ncorresponding W (Z = 74) [32,33] and Os (Z = 76) isotones\n[Figs. 14(b) and 14(c)]. In W nuclei, while N < 106 isotopes\nalign at h\u00af\u03c9<\u223c0.3 MeV, a sharp alignment is observed at\nh\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.38 MeV in 182W (N = 108) [33]. In 184W (N =\n110), the ground state band has been observed up to h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248\n0.4 MeV, where an onset of alignment is seen. For the isotones\nin Os, the first alignment has been completely mapped and\nreveals a strong backbending behavior. The alignments in\n184,186Os (N = 108, 110) are seen at h\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.35 MeV, which\nis considerably higher than lighter isotopes which align at\nh\u00af\u03c9 \u2248 0.25 MeV. The experimental crossing frequencies in the\nosmium isotopes are lower than those in the corresponding\nhafnium and tungsten isotones by \u223c0.05 MeV, but the\n\u03b3 softness inherent in the Os isotopes complicates a direct\ncomparison with the Hf and W nuclei.

The same Harris parameters, J0(30 h\u00af2 MeV\u22121)\nand J1(40 h\u00af4 MeV\u22123), have been used for all plots.\nnucleon alignment in the ground state bands for both 180Hf and\n182Hf up to rotational frequencies of h\u00af\u03c9 \u223c 0.43 MeV suggests\nthat either the nucleons align at a higher frequency or sharp\nbackbends are imminent, which would effectively reduce the\ncrossing frequency to below 0.43 MeV.\nPrevious calculations with a modified harmonic oscillator\npotential [34] predict that the first i13\/2 neutron alignment\nis considerably delayed for the N = 108 isotones compared\nwith that for the lighter ones. Cranked Woods-Saxon cal-\nculations have been performed to investigate the predicted\ncrossing frequencies and shape evolution with increasing\nrotational frequency and spin [35], which were compared with\nexperimental results. The universal Woods-Saxon potential\nparameters [36], with the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)\nformalism and Strutinsky shell correction were used. The\npairing interaction was taken to be of the monopole form.\nTo calculate the total Routhian surfaces (TRS), the pair gap\n\u00070 was determined self-consistently at \u03c9 = 0 using the BCS\nformalism and was allowed to decrease gradually to half its\nvalue at \u03c9 = \u03c9c. The value of \u03c9c was chosen to be 0.7 MeV,\nwhich is typical for the rare-earth region. For determining\ncrossing frequencies, an empirical value of the pair gap\nenergy was obtained from odd-even mass differences using\na five-point expression [37].\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n-1.8\n-1.2\n-0.6\n0.0\n0.6\n1.2\n1.8\nZ = 72,\n2\n = 0.263,\n4\n = -0.061,  = 0\ne p\nro\nt (\nM\neV\n)\n(MeV)\n (+, +1\/2)\n (+, -1\/2)\n (-, +1\/2)\n (-, -1\/2)\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n-0.9\n-0.6\n-0.3\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\nN = 108,\n2\n = 0.263,\n4\n = -0.061,  = 0\ne n\neu\nt (\nM\neV\n)\n(MeV)\n (+, +1\/2)\n (+, -1\/2)\n (-, +1\/2)\n (-, -1\/2)\nFIG. 15. Calculated neutron and proton quasiparticle energy\nlevels for 180Hf [35].\nThe calculated quasiparticle levels for 180Hf (N = 108) are\nshown in Fig. 15. The first crossing, corresponding to the\nfirst i13\/2 neutron alignment, is seen to occur, with very weak\ninteraction, at h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.33 MeV, a small jump over the crossing\nfrequencies of \u223c0.26 MeV calculated for the N = 100 to N =\n106 even-N Hf isotopes [35]. For 182Hf (N = 110), the first\ncalculated crossing is at 0.38 MeV (Fig. 16). The calculations\nindicate that the interaction matrix element at the crossing, as\na function of N , is the smallest for N = 108. The observed\nalignment is, therefore, expected to be most pronounced for\nthe N = 108 isotones, as is indeed observed [33] in 182W\n[Fig. 14(b)]. The calculations for 182W predict the crossing\nat h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.34 MeV. The experimentally observed value for\n182W is h\u00af\u03c9 = 0.38 MeV, while the first crossing is observed at\n0.29 MeV for 180W. The increase in the crossing frequencies\nfor N = 108 isotones in this region is generally attributed\nto an increased gap near the Fermi level, a consequence of\na neutron subshell closure at N = 108 [32].

Calculated neutron and proton quasiparticle energy\nlevels for 182Hf [35].\nis also evident from an increase in the experimental odd-even\nmass differences [38]. The modified oscillator calculations\nreproduce the subshell gap at N = 108 better than the Woods-\nSaxon calculations. Therefore, the crossing frequency, which\nincreases in the vicinity of a shell gap, is predicted to be higher\nby the modified oscillator calculations.\nAnother intriguing possibility is whether the discrepancies\nbetween expected and observed crossing frequencies for\n180,182Hf are related to the predicted collective prolate-to-\noblate shape transitions at high spin for the N \u0001 108 even-N\nisotones [4,5,39]. The spin values at which the shape transition\nis predicted is \u223c26 h\u00af for 180Hf [4] and \u223c22 h\u00af for 182Hf [5].\nTRS calculations [35] for the global energy minima in even-N\nHf isotopes indicate that the oblate minimum appears at\nprogressively lower energy with increasing neutron number\nand becomes yrast for N \u0001 108 nuclei at higher frequencies\n(Fig. 17). These results are in good agreement with those\nof Xu et al. [5]. The present work extends the ground\nstate band of 182Hf up to 18 h\u00af and rotational frequencies of\nFIG. 17.

Energy minima show a drift from prolate (A) to\noblate (B) shapes as a function of rotational frequency. For the same\nrotational frequency, the oblate energy minimum in 182Hf is better\ndefined than in 180Hf.\n\u223c0.4 MeV, in the vicinity of the predicted prolate-to-oblate\nshape transition. It is suggested that the collective oblate shapes\nresult mainly from the rotational alignments of the i13\/2 neutron\nand h11\/2 proton pairs [5]. The weak band that interacts with\nthe even signature of the \u03b3 -vibrational band seems headed\ntoward a crossing with the ground state band in the vicinity\nof the first nucleon alignment. Since these alignments have\nyet to be experimentally mapped, a detailed discussion on the\npossible effects of a shape change on nucleon alignments and\nvice versa seems premature.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nThe present work has significantly expanded our knowledge\nof high-spin collective structures in neutron-rich hafnium\n034305-13\nE. NGIJOI-YOGO et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 034305 (2007)\nnuclei, using recent advances in experimental techniques and\nthe combination of powerful detector systems. The ground\nstate bands of 180Hf and 182Hf have been extended close\nto their respective first nucleon alignments. Configurations\nfor observed two-quasiparticle, high-K structures have been\nfirmly established. A notable result is the absence of alignment\nin either nucleus up to the highest spins achieved in this\nwork, which constitutes a significant increase in the frequency\nof the first crossing compared to the lower-A even-even\nisotopes. Similar behavior observed in the N = 108 and\nN = 110 isotones of W and Os nuclei is attributed to a\nsubshell closure leading to an increased pair gap. Increasing\nodd-even staggering in \u03b3 -vibrational excitations mapped to\nmoderately high angular momenta in 180Hf is understood via\nthe interaction of the even-spin signature of the band with\na low-K two-quasiparticle band. Systematic cranked shell\nmodel calculations have been performed to understand the\npossible parameters which might affect nucleon alignment\ncharacteristics in these nuclei which lie at the edge of\ncurrent experimental techniques. The exercise highlights the\ninadequacy of multipoint smoothing algorithms used to extract\npair gap parameters near subshell closures. The determination\nof any possible connection between the delayed alignment\nand predicted prolate-to-oblate shape transitions at higher spin\nmust await further data. A recent experiment with a heavier\nreaction partner for hafnium at a higher bombarding energy\nshould be able to map the high-spin structures of these nuclei\nbeyond the first nucleon alignments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy\nunder Grants DE-FG02-94ER40848, W-31-109-ENG-38, and\nthe National Science Foundation.\n[1] R.
