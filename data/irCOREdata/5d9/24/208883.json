However, patterns of use of economics methods alongside systematic review remain unclear. Reviews of evidence on the effects of interventions are published by both the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations. Although it is not a requirement that Cochrane or Campbell Reviews should consider economic aspects of interventions, many do. This study aims to explore and describe approaches to incorporating economics methods in a selection of Cochrane systematic reviews in the area of health promotion and public health, to help inform development of methodological guidance on economics for reviewers.\\ud\nMethods\\ud\n\\ud\nThe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched using a search strategy for potential economic evaluation studies. We included current Cochrane reviews and review protocols retrieved using the search that are also identified as relevant to health promotion or public health topics. A reviewer extracted data which describe the economics components of included reviews. Extracted data were summarised in tables and analysed qualitatively.\\ud\nResults\\ud\n\\ud\nTwenty-one completed Cochrane reviews and seven review protocols met inclusion criteria. None incorporate formal economic evaluation methods. Ten completed reviews explicitly aim to incorporate economics studies and data.

High quality systematic\nreviews can provide robust and comparatively inexpen-\nsive evidence of what is known about intervention effec-\ntiveness, which may often be more likely to convince\ndecision-makers than evidence from single studies [1,2].\nThe Cochrane Collaboration and Campbell Collabora-\ntion are parallel international organisations committed to\nsummarising and providing access to evidence on the\neffects and other aspects of interventions using systematic\nreview methods. This involves the systematic identifica-\ntion, critical review and synthesis (typically using a meta-\nanalysis) of evidence on main clinical effectiveness (incor-\nporating adverse events and complications) \u2013 evidence\nprimarily extracted from randomised controlled trials.\nThe aim is to maximise the precision of estimates of effec-\ntiveness (or, alternatively, to minimise bias in such esti-\nmates) by selecting studies based on predetermined\ncriteria, including study quality. Cochrane focuses on\nhealth care interventions, whilst Campbell focuses on\neducation, criminal justice and social welfare interven-\ntions. There is nevertheless some overlap in focus of inter-\nest between the Collaborations where interventions,\nclient groups, important outcomes, or aspects of review\nmethodology cross these policy areas.\nCochrane and Campbell reviews are not currently\nrequired to incorporate an economics component. How-\never, it is increasingly accepted that provision of evidence\non intervention costs alongside evidence on effectiveness\ncan significantly enhance the relevance and usefulness of\nCochrane and other systematic reviews as a component of\nthe basis for decision-making by managers and policy\nmakers [3]. Evidence regarding the economics of interven-\ntions is useful at various stages of knowledge about their\neffectiveness. The relationship between expected changes\nin effects and costs determines the type and degree of\nadded value from the intervention. Clearly if outcomes\nare improved or not changed and costs are reduced, a\ntechnology will be economically efficient. However,\nwhere there is likely to be a high overall cost of improving\noutcomes, decision makers will need to consider if this is\nthe best use of resources. Finally, where outcomes are\nactually worse as a result of a form of care, the cost of\nchanging practice to avoid that form of care also needs to\nbe considered. Cochrane and Campbell reviewers increas-\ningly encounter economics studies conducted alongside\nthe randomised controlled trials and other studies\nincluded in their reviews. These factors have led to\nincreased numbers of Cochrane reviews, and a small\nnumber of Campbell Reviews, incorporating some eco-\nnomics aspects.\nEconomic evaluation is the comparative analysis of alter-\nnative courses of action in terms of both their costs\n(resource use) and consequences (effectiveness) [4]. We\nuse the term 'evidence-based economic evaluation' to dis-\ntinguish forms of full economic evaluation based on sys-\ntematic review and research synthesis methods from those\nbased on a single primary study, such as economic evalu-\nations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials.\nAlthough the latter can clearly be of high research quality,\nthey may not include all available and relevant evidence\nin their analyses for policy decisions. Evidence-based eco-\nnomic evaluation is increasingly used to inform policy\ndecisions falling under the auspices of organisations with\nnational responsibilities for health technology assessment\nand guidance on the prevention and treatment of ill\nhealth (e.g. National Institute for Health and Clinical\nExcellence (NICE); US Center for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC); Canadian Agency for Drugs and Tech-\nnology in Health (CADTH, formerly CCHOTA); Austral-\nian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee\n(PBAC)).\nWhilst the details of methodological requirements for\nsuch studies vary across these agencies [5], evidence-based\neconomic evaluation essentially sets out to estimate, or\nmodel, the joint distribution of costs and effects resulting\nfrom a health care intervention or programme, compared\nto its alternatives, within a defined population, by system-\natically identifying and synthesising the best available\nsources of data on five key parameters: main clinical effec-\ntiveness, adverse events and complications; baseline clin-\nical events; resource use and unit costs; and utilities (or\nother measures of preferences for health states) [6]. The\naim is to maximise the precision of estimates of these\nparameters (or, alternatively, to minimise bias in their\nestimation), so that residual uncertainty associated with\nestimates of incremental cost-effectiveness (joint costs\nand effects) is minimised. A useful decision-aid, in the\nform of graphical presentation of costs and effectiveness\noutcomes, is a 'cost-effectiveness plane' (or 'cost-effective-\nness matrix') [7].\nA well-conducted meta-analysis of randomised controlled\ntrials, with direct comparison between alternative inter-\nventions, has been proposed as the least-biased source of\nevidence to inform ranges of values for the main clinical\neffectiveness parameter in an evidence-based economic\nevaluation [6,8]. Indeed, for this reason, companion sys-\ntematic reviews of effectiveness studies (or 'effectiveness\nreviews') often provide a natural vehicle for evidence-\nbased economic evaluations, such as those undertaken for\nNICE. Similarly, Cochrane (or Campbell) reviews incor-\nporating a meta-analysis can provide an unbiased source\nfor the effectiveness parameter in an economic evaluation\n(for a full economic evaluation, the effectiveness reviewPage 2 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2006, 6:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/6\/55will need to be supplemented by additional searches to\ninform ranges of values for the other key parameters in the\neconomic model).\nAs such, the interfaces between evidence-based economic\nevaluation and Cochrane and Campbell review methods\nare bilateral and multifaceted. Whilst on one hand a\nCochrane or Campbell review can provide useful and\napplicable data for an evidence-based economic evalua-\ntion, full economic evaluation studies and other econom-\nics studies (e.g. costing studies) can also be included in a\ncritical review of the extant economics literature that may\nbe undertaken as an integrated component of a Cochrane\n(or Campbell) review. Some methodological research has\nalready been undertaken to examine the use of Cochrane\nand other effectiveness reviews and the Cochrane Library\nin evidence-based economic evaluations [6,9]. However,\npatterns of use of economics methods within Cochrane\nreviews remain unclear.\nThe Campbell & Cochrane Economics Methods Group\n(CCEMG) was formally approved and registered as a\nmethods group for The Cochrane Collaboration in 1998,\nand as a joint methods group with The Campbell Collab-\noration since 2004. CCEMG's aims and scope, reported\nelsewhere, encompass development of evidence-based\neconomic evaluation methods and economics advice for\nreviewers [10].\nThis paper reports a rapid review of existing Cochrane\nreviews which focus on the effectiveness of health promo-\ntion and public health interventions. The main aim of the\nstudy, undertaken on behalf of CCEMG, was to examine\napproaches to incorporating economics studies and data\nthat have been utilised in such reviews to date. A better\nunderstanding of these issues can help to inform the\ndevelopment of evidence-based guidance for reviewers on\nmethods for making reviews more useful to economic\ndecisions.\nThe reason for choosing to look at Cochrane reviews was\nbecause, being a much newer collaboration, fewer Camp-\nbell reviews are yet published. The topic area 'health pro-\nmotion and public health' was chosen because many\nhealth promotion and public health interventions, whilst\naiming to influence health outcomes and resources, are\norganised across sectors (e.g. health, education, social\ncare, criminal justice) and are likely to have important\nimpacts on outcomes and resource use beyond the health\nsector, and because a key aim of the study was to pilot a\nreview methodology in preparation for a systematic\nreview of economics methods in both Cochrane Collabo-\nration and Campbell Collaboration systematic reviews,\nencompassing reviews of complex and multi-sector inter-\nventions, as well as interventions in health care, health\npromotion and public health, mental health, education,\ncriminal justice and social welfare.\nMethods\nThe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane\nLibrary (2005, Issue 3) was searched using a search strat-\negy for economic studies. This was adapted from an estab-\nlished search strategy used by the UK Centre for Reviews\nand Dissemination to identify potential economic evalu-\nations within Ovid CD-ROM versions of Current Con-\ntents \u2013 Clinical Medicine, Medline and CINAHL databases\nas part of the process of maintaining the NHS Economic\nEvaluation Database [11], published as part of the\nCochrane Library. The strategy was used to search the title,\nabstract and keyword fields within records of both com-\npleted reviews and review protocols held in the Cochrane\nDatabase of Systematic Reviews [12]. The search was con-\nducted on 4th August 2005. The full search strategy was as\nfollows:\n(econom*, cost*, pric*, pharmacoecon*, cost NEXT\n(effectiveness, utili*, benefit, minimi*, energy, oxygen,\nmetabolic), (expenditure NOT energy), (value NEAR\/2\nmoney), budget*, preference, qaly, (quality NEXT\nadjusted), utility, utilities, financ* NEXT (management,\nsupport, organized))\nThe Cochrane Health Promotion and Public Health Field\nmaintains an online list of Cochrane reviews and review\nprotocols identified as relevant to health promotion and\npublic health [13]. Reviews and review protocols were\nincluded if they appeared on both the latter list and the\nlist of record titles retrieved by the search. Full reports of\nincluded reviews and review protocols were assessed to\nestablish details of the economics component of each\nreview. Data describing the economics component of\nreviews were extracted, coded, tabulated, analysed quali-\ntatively and summarised by one researcher, working inde-\npendently.\nFor those reviews which aim to incorporate economics\nstudies, initial focussed searches for additional, relevant\nfull economic evaluation studies (not included in the\nreview) were conducted in the NHS Economic Evaluation\nDatabase, using search strategies that were developed by\ncombining search terms used in the corresponding review\nwith MeSH terms used to index the corresponding review.\nResults\nA 'Quorum Statement' flow-diagram is included as Figure\n1. The initial search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic\nReviews, to identify economic references in existing\nreviews and protocols, identified 483 records out of 4041\nrecords held in the database. One record was excluded at\nthis stage since the corresponding review has been with-Page 3 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2006, 6:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/6\/55drawn. Four hundred and five records contained current,\ncompleted Cochrane reviews. Seventy-seven records con-\ntained protocols for Cochrane reviews \u2013 reviews which are\nregistered but not yet completed.\nTwenty-one of the 405 completed reviews retrieved by the\ninitial search are also listed as relevant to health promo-\ntion and public health [[22-42] in Table 1]. As such,\napproximately 11% of the total number of completed\nreviews identified as relevant to health promotion and\npublic health contain economics references (21 of 186).\nThese 21 reviews spanned a wide range of health promo-\ntion and public health topics (e.g. mental and social\nhealth; population screening; prevention of infectious dis-\nease; prevention of injuries; sexual health; cardiovascular\nhealth). Additionally, 7 of the 77 review protocols\nretrieved by the initial search are also listed as relevant to\nhealth promotion and public health [[43-49] in Table 1].\nThis represents approximately 4% of the total number of\nreview protocols identified as relevant to health promo-\ntion and public health (7 of 162).\nApproaches to incorporating economics studies or data\nThe principal findings from this rapid review are summa-\nrised in Table 1. It is evident that none of these 21 com-\npleted reviews, or 7 review protocols, incorporates formal\neconomic evaluation methods (i.e. a cost-consequences,\ncost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost benefit analysis).\nThat is, none of the reviews includes an aim to model the\njoint distribution of incremental costs and effects result-\ning from the interventions studied, compared to relevant\nalternatives, based on a synthesis of the results of studies\nincluded in the review.\nTen of 21 completed reviews do aim explicitly to incorpo-\nrate economics studies and\/or data into the review (4 of 7\nprotocols include this explicit aim). However, none of\nthese ten reviews describe either a specific methodological\napproach (e.g. a systematic review of economic evaluation\nstudies) or specific methods (e.g. search strategies, critical\nappraisal, inclusion criteria, analytic methods) underpin-\nning incorporation of such studies and data.\nOne review protocol does include a clear description of\nthe specific methodological approach that will underpin\nincorporation of economics studies and data. Ilic et al\ninclude, as a secondary objective, to \"conduct a systematic\nreview of studies regarding the economic evaluation of\nscreening for prostate cancer. This will aim to identify the\ncost effectiveness, cost utility and cost-benefit of mass\nscreening for prostatic cancer\" [48].\nIt is, however, possible to establish some details of the\napproaches pursued in the ten completed reviews that\nexplicitly aim to incorporate economics studies and data.\nFour of these ten reviews include a specific economic\nquestion or objective to be addressed in the systematic\nreview (alongside the main focus on intervention effec-\ntiveness) [22,23,27,42]. For example, Hey and Perrera\n[23] ask, \"What are the cost implications of providing\nincentives and competitions for smoking cessation?\",\nwhilst Ashworth et al [27] ask, \"Which exercise pro-\ngrammes are the most cost-effective?\" Note that the eco-\nnomic question formulated by Hey and Perrera [23]\nimplies a concern with evidence related to the distribution\nof costs associated with the interventions being studied,\nwhilst the question formulated by Ashworth et al [27]\nimplies a concern with evidence related the joint distribu-\ntion of costs and effects associated with the interventions,\nor cost-effectiveness (as did the objective in the Ilic et al\nprotocol [48]).\nSeven of the ten reviews aiming to incorporate economics\nstudies and data [25,27,30,33,35,39,40] include one or\nmore economic variables \u2013 measures of cost, resource use\nor service utilisation \u2013 as outcomes of interest in the\nreview, alongside other 'effectiveness' outcomes.

Similarly, Chilvers et al [40] include\n\"capital expenditure\", \"total cost of care per tenant or\nrespondent\" and \"total health costs per tenant or respond-\nent\" in a set of secondary 'economic outcomes'. It is of\nnote that in this second example [40], specific compo-\nnents of intervention 'costs' are clearly described, whilst in\nthe first [39], it is comparatively unclear which elements\nof 'costs' will be considered. All economic variables speci-\nfied as outcomes in these Cochrane reviews imply a con-\ncern with evidence related to the distribution of costs (or\nresource use) associated with the interventions being\nstudied, as opposed to evidence on cost-effectiveness.\nNone of the ten completed reviews aiming to incorporate\neconomics studies and data appears to include use of sup-\nplementary search strategies designed specifically to cap-\nture economics studies and data other than those\nconducted alongside those studies captured in searches\nspecified for the effectiveness review. Also, only one of\nthese ten reviews explicitly includes a search of one or\nmore specialist electronic databases of economics studies\n[33] (one protocol, incorporating plans for a systematic\nreview of relevant economic evaluation studies, signals an\nintention to include such a search [48]). The extent to\nwhich search strategies for relevant economics studies and\ndata extended beyond those studies identified and\nretrieved for the effectiveness review is therefore unclear.\nAnalysis of economics studies and data\nFive of the 10 completed reviews aiming to incorporate\neconomics studies and data (plus one other review which\ndid not explicitly seek such studies or data [26]) indicate\nthat no such relevant studies or data are identified\n[22,26,27,30,39,40]. This would clearly preclude any\nform of analysis intending to utilise such studies or data.\nHowever, some reviews \u2013 including at least one review\nwhich sought, but did not identify any such studies or\ndata [30] \u2013 are likely to have missed potentially relevant\neconomics studies that could have been identified\nthrough searches using the NHS Economic Evaluation\nDatabase (NHS EED) [14] and\/or other specialist elec-\ntronic databases of economics studies.\nFor example, our own searches of NHS EED, conducted to\ninform this rapid review, identified a small number of\nadditional potentially relevant economic evaluation stud-\nies that had not been identified in the corresponding\nCochrane review. One or more additional, potentially rel-\nevant economic evaluation studies were identified for 5 of\nthe 10 reviews that include an aim to incorporate eco-\nnomics studies and data [23,30,35,40,42] (although in\ntwo of these five cases, a single additional economic eval-\nuation has been published since the last substantive\nupdate of the corresponding Cochrane review [23,40]).\nThese additional economics evaluation studies were\nbased either on a review and synthesis of primary studies,\nor on effectiveness data from sources other than the types\nof studies (primarily randomised trials) targeted for the\nCochrane effectiveness review. It is also worth highlight-\ning that a majority (although not all) relevant economic\nevaluation studies which had been identified across these\n21 Cochrane reviews have a corresponding full abstract\nrecord in the NHS Economic Evaluation Database.\nThe other 5 completed reviews aiming to incorporate eco-\nnomics studies and data (with the addition of one other\nreview which did not explicitly seek such studies or data\n[31]) include a narrative summary of relevant findings in\neconomics studies identified in the review\n[23,25,31,33,35,42]. For example, Forbes et al [33]\ninclude a summary of cost data reported alongside two\nincluded randomised controlled trials \u2013 one appears to be\na costing study which presents data on total estimated\ncosts of the interventions for each intervention group;\nanother appears to be an economic evaluation which\npresents data on the estimated incremental costs of the\ninterventions per additional diagnostic test (cervical\nsmear test) performed, compared with usual care. Lees et\nal [35] include a narrative summary of the general conclu-\nsions of three economic evaluations of neonatal screening\nprogrammes, whilst Gillespie et al [31] include a narrative\nsummary of cost-effectiveness estimates (cost per fall pre-\nvented) extracted from five included randomised control-\nled trials that had incorporated economic evaluations.\nNone of the reviews incorporating a narrative summary\nwhich focuses on the costs of the interventions (e.g. pre-\nsenting data on the incremental costs of resource inputs\nrequired for an intervention) includes adjustment of such\ndata for currency and inflation, and only one presents\ndata in such a way that would allow such adjustments to\nbe undertaken subsequently [31]. Also, none of these nar-\nrative summaries include critical appraisal of the method-\nological quality of included economics studies, or\ncommentary on the economic questions, costing methods\nand analytic viewpoints adopted in such studies. None of\nthe completed reviews incorporates a quantitative synthe-\nsis of measures of cost or resource use, extracted from\nincluded primary studies (e.g. meta-analysis).\nOther issues relevant to economics methods\nThree completed reviews draw attention to the point that\neconomic analyses of the interventions are not currently\nappropriate, due to inconclusive or methodologically\nweak evidence, or a lack of evidence of intervention effec-Page 7 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2006, 6:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/6\/55tiveness (in terms of primary review outcomes)\n[23,26,40]. More generally, only 6 of the 21 Cochrane\nreviews considered in this rapid review find that the inter-\nvention(s) studied show evidence of 'effectiveness', or 'a\npositive effect' (including those which show 'good evi-\ndence', or 'strong evidence' of effectiveness) [24-\n26,30,38,42]. Three of these 6 reviews aim to include eco-\nnomics studies or data [25,30,42], of which one [42] has\nbeen found to have missed a small number of potentially\nrelevant economic evaluation studies. The other 15\nreviews either conclude that there is: no evidence\n[22,29,32,35,39,40]; no clear evidence of effectiveness\n[23,26,27]; weak evidence of effectiveness [37,41]; evi-\ndence of mixed effectiveness (i.e. the intervention was\nfound to be effective in some groups but not necessarily in\nothers) [31,33,34]; or some evidence of ineffectiveness\n[36].\nEleven of 21 completed reviews highlight a need for future\nprimary research incorporating economic evaluation\nmethods in order to establish evidence on intervention\ncost-effectiveness [22,25,27,29-34,38,42]. This included\ntwo reviews for which additional, potentially relevant eco-\nnomic evaluations have been identified through initial\nsearches of the NHS economic evaluation database (con-\nducted to inform this rapid review) [30,42].\nFinally, three other reviews amongst the 21 considered in\nthis rapid review were retrieved by the initial search of the\nCochrane Library because the review covers discussion of\none or more relevant economic aspects of the populations\nor interventions being studied [24,28,37]. In most cases\nthe scope of this discussion relates to economic factors as\ndeterminants of epidemiology, patterns of intervention\nprovision or uptake, or potential economic consequences\nof interventions. For example, Shepherd et al highlight the\nhigher incidence of cervical cancer amongst women of\nlower socio-economic class than amongst middle class\nwomen in Britain [28], whilst Zoritch et al highlight that\ndifferent levels of day-care provision in part reflect cul-\ntural and economic interests concerning the welfare of\nchildren and the need to promote mothers' participation\nin paid work [24].\nDiscussion\nThis rapid review has shown that relatively few Cochrane\nsystematic reviews relevant to health promotion and pub-\nlic health incorporate an economics dimension. It is also\nclear however that a sizable minority of Cochrane review-\ners are aware that their topic of review has economic\nimplications and wish to report this aspect. The review has\nfurther shown that where such reviews do incorporate\neconomics studies and data, methodological approaches\nvary considerably, and the methods used are not consist-\nently reported. The extent to which these principal find-\nings are reflected across all Cochrane reviews may usefully\nbe explored further.\nIt was not anticipated that the Cochrane reviews included\nin this study would widely incorporate formal economic\nevaluation methods. The Cochrane Collaboration has\nalways aimed to produce high quality reviews of effects of\nhealth care interventions in order to support decisions\nwhich also need information from other sources. How-\never, since Cochrane reviews aim to have international\napplicability, it is not currently clear how incorporation of\nfull economic evaluation methods could be constructively\nachieved within such reviews [15]. This is because full eco-\nnomic evaluation involves estimation of the joint distri-\nbution of incremental costs and effects (cost-\neffectiveness) accruing from an intervention, compared to\nrelevant alternatives, for specific populations, jurisdic-\ntions, or settings. Such estimates are sensitive to variability\nacross settings in local prices (cost), the organisation of\ncare (resource use) and values attached to specific health\nrelated outcomes (e.g. utilities) [16-18] and this may limit\nthe generalisability or transferability of such estimates\nacross settings (e.g. across different nations). Conversely,\nthere is a general belief that relative clinical effectiveness\n(or 'relative risk reduction') is not influenced by jurisdic-\ntion and setting (although absolute risk reduction is\ndependent on baseline levels of risk in a given population,\nwhich is variable across settings). Whilst this naturally\nmilitates against the incorporation of formal economic\nevaluation methods into Cochrane reviews, it does not\npreclude the use of data from Cochrane reviews in paral-\nlel, or subsequent jurisdiction specific economic evalua-\ntion studies. It should also be noted that for the same\nreasons, there are currently no agreed upon methods for\ncombining incremental cost-effectiveness, cost-utility or\ncost-benefit ratios from multiple studies.\nThe results also indicate that this set of Cochrane reviews\nrarely select studies on the basis that they meet criteria for\nbeing classified as full economic evaluations, such as\nthose defined by Drummond et al [4,19]. Rather, studies\nare selected based on inclusion criteria set for the effective-\nness review (with a focus on randomised trials). As such,\nthis set of Cochrane reviews considers only those econom-\nics studies conducted alongside studies eligible for inclu-\nsion in the effectiveness review. This may exclude relevant\ndata contained in full economic evaluations based on\nreviews of existing trials, those based on effectiveness data\nfrom sources other than randomised controlled trials, and\nother economics studies, or partial economic evaluations\n(e.g. costing studies).\nUse of searches specifically tailored to the retrieval of rel-\nevant economics studies, and searches of specialist data-\nbases, such as NHS EED, would help to address thisPage 8 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2006, 6:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/6\/55situation. It has been shown in this study that incorpora-\ntion of such searches can prove fruitful. Additionally,\nreviewers considering the economic perspective should\nconsider undertaking classification of the economics stud-\nies encountered in a review, and critical appraisal of their\nmethodological quality, using a purpose-specific, estab-\nlished checklist prior to the final decision to include or\nexclude such studies [19,20].\nAlthough the CCEMG has existed for nearly a decade, evi-\ndence-based guidance on handling economic issues in\nCochrane Reviews has not been covered specifically in the\nCochrane Reviewers' Handbook. Reviewers have had\naccess to workshops at annual meetings and to informal\nadvice from the members of the economics methods\ngroup. Perhaps linked to this lack of agreed approach, the\nmethods used to derive cost and resource use, or cost-\neffectiveness estimates in primary studies are not consist-\nently critiqued in this set of Cochrane reviews.\nSome of the reviews report economic outcomes that were\nmeasured within one or more trials. Economics studies\nwill vary in their results because the economic question\nand analytic viewpoint varies between studies, and so the\nvariables included and the values given to them are spe-\ncific to the study [15]. Formal critique of included eco-\nnomics studies is required to clarify, for the users of\nreviews, whether such estimates consist of comparable, or\nhomogeneous, cost, or resource use components.\nEven where it is not appropriate to combine cost or\nresource use data, cost or resource use estimates from sev-\neral primary studies can provide a range of values for cost\nand resource use parameters in a sensitivity analysis that\nmay be conducted as part of a parallel or subsequent eco-\nnomic evaluation based on the review. Allied to this, esti-\nmates of monetary cost could be adjusted for currency and\ninflation, in order to facilitate comparison of estimates\nacross several included studies.\nMore generally, the intended scope of overall analytic\napproaches to economics studies and data is often unclear\nin this set of Cochrane reviews. Although we found none\nin this study, other Cochrane reviews include measures of\ncost and\/or resource use as review outcomes with the\nintention of extracting these data from relevant economics\nstudies and producing pooled estimates of incremental\ncosts or incremental resource use using meta-analysis [e.g.\n[21]], including a test for heterogeneity (this is the same\nbasic approach as that taken to the meta-analysis of effect-\nsize and adverse effects data in Cochrane and other effec-\ntiveness reviews). When presented alongside the pooled\nestimates of effect-size (i.e. separate estimation of the dis-\ntribution of costs and the distribution of effects), these\ndata can provide an indication of the quadrant of the\n'cost-effectiveness plane' that an intervention is likely to\nfall within. This is potentially useful information that can\nhelp determine whether further economic evaluation is\nwarranted.\nHowever, it is not clear in this set of Cochrane reviews\nhow those including economic variables originally\nintended to analyse them. It is therefore not possible to\njudge whether intended aims were fulfilled with respect to\nthe economics components of the reviews. This situation\ncould be improved with more consistent reporting of\nintended methods.\nFinally, it could be argued that economic decisions should\nonly be made on the basis of strong evidence of interven-\ntion effectiveness and that, by implication, Cochrane\nreviews should concentrate on establishing evidence of\neffectiveness before any decision to include an economics\ndimension. However, at the point of planning a Cochrane\nreview, it is likely that economic decisions are being, or\nhave already been taken about the technology being stud-\nied. It therefore seems to the authors that there is likely to\nbe additional value to end-users in a systematic review\nwhich refers to the existing economics evidence, whatever\nthe current status of the effectiveness evidence. This may\nallow decision makers using the review to place the tech-\nnology on the cost-effectiveness plane [7]. For example, if\na review concludes that there is evidence of no statistically\nsignificant difference between comparator interventions\n(clinical effectiveness), then critical review of existing eco-\nnomics evidence can help to establish, given similar clin-\nical effectiveness, which intervention is less costly?\nConclusion\nCochrane reviews of the effects of health care interven-\ntions are used in economic decisions in a wide range of\nsettings, and many review groups are aware of this. Within\nthe Cochrane Collaboration, diverse methods for address-\ning economics issues have evolved, and we are convinced,\nfrom the results of this review, of the value of developing\nguidance for reviewers wishing to incorporate economics\naspects in their review.\nEvident variability across approaches to economics stud-\nies and data in Cochrane reviews, all within a single,\nbroad topic area, indicates a clear need for evidence-based\nguidance for Cochrane reviewers on whether and how to\nincorporate economics methods into the systematic\nreview process, at different levels. Such guidance will need\nto promote a consistent approach to the reporting of the\neconomics components of such reviews. There is a also\nneed for increased dialogue between Cochrane reviewers\nand economists to develop the capacity for economic\nanalyses alongside Cochrane reviews, for example to\ndecide on the need to consider economic aspects, to setPage 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Research Methodology 2006, 6:55 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2288\/6\/55their economic findings within a discussion of the eco-\nnomic issues around a technology, and to refer to other\nstudies of the economics of the technology being evalu-\nated.\nThe current study has also indicated that Cochrane\nreviews may require a specific approach to guidance on\nmethods, distinct from generally available advice on eco-\nnomic evaluation and Health Technology Assessment,\ngiven the aim of the Cochrane Collaboration to provide\nan international source of evidence on effects of health\nrelated interventions. However, whilst economics meth-\nods in a global context. are likely to be distinct from those\nunderpinning evidence-based full economic evaluations,\nthey nevertheless feature on the same methodological\ncontinuum.\nThat is, the analytic framework provided by economic\nevaluation can help Cochrane reviewers to formulate an\nintegrated systematic review of relevant economics stud-\nies, alongside the review of effectiveness studies, but\nwhich need not necessarily be restricted to the economics\ncomponents of included effectiveness studies. This type of\nfull critical review, including coverage of all the economic\nanalyses of the economics of interventions, can provide\nusers of the review with the international context within\nwhich economics data can be interpreted and assessed as\na preliminary to use of evidence-based economic evalua-\ntion methods.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nIS conceived of and designed the study, conducted the\nstudy, interpreted the findings and drafted the manu-\nscript.
