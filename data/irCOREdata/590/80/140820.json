Introduction25\nMany studies in the research literature describe how agricultural production in Africa will be26\none of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change and variability (Challinor et al., 2005).27\n2This is because a significant proportion of the African economy is dependent on agriculture,28\nmost of Africa\u2019s water (85%) is used for agriculture (Downing et al., 1997), farming29\ntechniques are relatively primitive and the majority of the continent is already hot and dry30\n(Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn, 2008). Spatial and temporal changes in precipitation and31\ntemperature patterns will thus have major impacts on the viability of both dryland and32\nirrigated farming (Benhin, 2008). For an important commodity crop such as sugarcane where33\nwater is a limiting factor in production, the priorities are to assess the impacts of climate34\nchange on both resource availability (for irrigation abstraction) and water demand (for crop35\nproduction). However, most studies to date have focussed on agriculture and rural livelihoods,36\nwith limited attention to impacts on sugarcane in southern Africa (Deressa et al., 2005).37\nIn many African countries, including Nigeria (Binbol et al., 2006), South Africa (Hassan and38\nOlbrich, 2000), Zambia and Zimbabwe, sugarcane forms the mainstay of the economy. In39\nSwaziland, production dates back to the mid-1950s, with the establishment of mills at Big40\nBend, Mhlume and Simunye. Sugarcane production has grown steadily, and in 200741\naccounted for 59% of Swaziland\u2019s agricultural output and 24% of gross domestic product42\n(GDP). In 2008 production was reported to be 5,100,456 tonnes with an average annual yield43\nof 102 t ha-1 (SSA, 2009). Most cultivation is concentrated on large plantations in the44\nLowveld and Lower Middleveld regions, where fertile soils and high temperatures provide45\nideal conditions for production, although all are dependant on irrigation to supplement low46\nrainfall during the growing season. In this context, Swaziland is unique, as sugarcane cannot47\nbe grown without irrigation, in contrast to neighbouring countries such as South Africa where48\n40% of the total cropped area is irrigated (Inman-Bamber and Smith, 2005). As a49\nconsequence, the majority of water abstracted for agriculture (96%) in Swaziland is used for50\nsugarcane production (Matondo et al., 2005).51\nThe total cane cropped area is currently 52,071 ha (SSA, 2009) having increased from 14,50052\nha in the late 1960s (Murdoch, 1968); further irrigation developments are underway which53\n3will result in an additional 19,000 ha being cultivated. This will add pressure on already54\nstrained water resources, and is likely to lead to increased tensions with neighbouring riparian55\nstates regarding water allocations for agriculture (Nkomo and van der Zaag, 2004). At present,56\nsugarcane irrigation needs vary between 10,000 to 14,000 m3 ha-1 depending on variety, soil57\nand agroclimate conditions. Although traditional methods such as furrow are still popular (39%58\nof the total area), sprinklers (54%), centre pivots (3%) and drip (3%) are gaining favour59\n(Nkomo and van der Zaag, 2004) as estates switch technology to improve water efficiency60\n(more \u2018crop per drop\u2019), coupled with concerns regarding labour availability (Merry, 2003).61\nDeressa et al (2005) assessed the economic impacts of climate change on sugarcane in South62\nAfrica using a Ricadian approach. By combining critical damage point analyses with63\ninformation on agroclimate variability their analyses showed that sugarcane revenue is more64\nsensitive to predicted increases in temperature, rather than rainfall. Their analysis excluded65\nthe impacts of CO2 fertilisation on productivity. Previous studies have investigated the66\nimpacts of climate change on water resources in Swaziland but have not considered sugarcane67\nproduction (Matondo et al., 2004). Other studies have assessed agronomic impacts and the68\npotential for using spatial (GIS) modelling for yield prediction (Kiker, 2000). The objective of69\nthis study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of climate change impacts on sugarcane70\nproduction in Swaziland.71\n2. Methodology72\nIn summary, the outputs from a general circulation model (GCM), a sugarcane crop growth73\nmodel and a geographical information system (GIS) have been combined to assess the spatial74\nand temporal impacts of climate change on cane yield and irrigation needs. Using selected75\nIPCC SRES scenarios for the 2050s (Nakicenovic et al., 2000), future climate datasets were76\nderived for a reference site using outputs from the HadCM3 model. The net annual irrigation77\nwater requirements (IRnet) and crop productivity (t ha-1) for the baseline and selected IPCC78\n4scenario were then simulated using the CANEGRO model embedded within the DSSAT79\n(Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) program (Jones et al., 2003). The80\ncrop simulations considered future emissions scenarios both with and without CO281\nfertilisation effects. Using potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD) as an aridity index, maps82\nshowing future changes in agroclimate were produced. Finally, a linear regression analysis83\nbetween agroclimate variability and irrigation need was used to estimate current and future84\nvolumetric water demand for sugarcane. A brief description of the study site, the climate85\nchange scenarios and datasets, crop modelling and GIS mapping, is provided below.86\n2.1 Study site87\nThe study site was Mhlume (Lon: 26:03:02S; Lat: 31:50:05E), in the eastern Lowveld, an area88\nin which nearly half the total area of irrigated sugarcane in Swaziland is located. The89\nCommonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) established a sugar mill at Mhlume in the90\n1950s, now owned by the Royal Swaziland Sugar Corporation (RSSC) who manage91\napproximately 20,000 ha of sugarcane which is milled at Mhlume and Simunye factories.92\nRSSC is one of the largest companies in Swaziland, producing two-thirds of the country\u2019s93\nsugar. Mhlume has a sub-tropical steppe climate and compared to other parts of the country,94\nthe Lowveld region is characterised by low rainfall and high temperatures. For this study,95\ndaily weather records for 1969-1996 for the site were available. In January, the mean monthly96\ntemperature is 31\u00b0C, but with daily maximum temperatures as high as 39\u00b0C. The minimum97\nmonthly mean temperature (9\u00b0C) occurs in winter (June to July), but on some days can be as98\nlow as 3\u00b0C. Nearly 80% of annual rainfall occurs between October and March. Reference99\nevapotranspiration (ETo) (Allen et al., 1998) exceeds rainfall in all months, with the greatest100\nmoisture deficits occurring between May and September (Figure 1). A cropping database for101\nRSSC provided detailed field records on planting and harvest dates, varieties grown, soil102\ntypes, ratoon periods, irrigation methods, and yields (harvested cane and sucrose) from 1980103\nto 2007. This database was used for validating the CANEGRO simulation outputs.104\n52.2 Climate change scenarios and datasets105\nClimate projections were based on the HadCM3, a third generation coupled atmosphere-ocean106\ngeneral circulation model developed at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and107\nResearch (Johns et al., 1997). It was developed from the earlier HadCM2 model, used to108\ngenerate predictions of climate change for the IPCC 3rd and 4th Assessment Reports, and has109\nbeen widely used in Africa for impact assessments. For example, Tanser et al (2003) studied110\nthe effects of climate change on malaria transmission in Africa using HadCM3 and three111\nclimate scenarios. Thomas et al (2005) studied the mobilization of southern African desert112\ndune systems using outputs from three GCMs (HadCM3, HadCM2 and CGCM1). They113\nshowed that for the HadCM3 model, index values for dune activity bore a very close114\nrelationship to those derived from observed data for the 1961\u201390 period.115\nThe HadCM3 has a higher spatial resolution than previous versions (2.5\u00b0 x 3.75\u00b0, latitude by116\nlongitude) and allows the radiative effects of CO2 and other minor greenhouse gases,117\nincluding water vapour and ozone to be represented. In order to provide information on118\npossible changes in global climate, the model is forced to consider future scenarios where119\nchanges in atmospheric CO2 concentration are assumed depending on anthropogenic activity120\nfor three 30-year mean periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s). The scenarios reflect different121\n\u2018storylines\u2019 based on differing rates of demographic change, industrial activity, dependence122\non fossil fuels, and other socio-economic indicators. These represent mutually consistent123\ncharacterisations of future states of the world during the 21st century, and are neither124\npredictions nor forecasts of future conditions. Rather, they describe alternative plausible125\nfutures that conform to sets of circumstances or constraints within which they arise. The true126\npurpose of scenarios is thus to determine the possible ramifications of climate change along127\none or more plausible (but indeterminate) paths.128\n6The emissions are based on those developed by the IPCC (Nakicenovic et al., 2000) and129\nknown as SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios). In simple terms, there are four130\n\u2018marker scenarios\u2019 that combine two sets of divergent tendencies. One set varying between131\nstrong economic values and strong environmental values, the other set varying between132\nincreasing globalisation and increasing regionalisation (IPCC-TGCIA, 1999). The scenarios133\nare commonly referred to as A1 (economic-global), B1 (environmental-global), A2134\n(economic-regional), and B2 (environmental \u2013regional). For this research, the A2 and B2135\nscenarios for the 2050s were chosen. The A2 scenario has the higher atmospheric CO2136\nconcentration and temperature increase with the highest population increase, the B2 is less137\nextreme, assuming greater efforts to control global CO2 emissions (de Silva et al., 2007)138\n(Table 1). Strzepek and McCluskey (2006) assessed the impacts of climate change on regional139\nwater resources and agriculture in Africa using five different models (CSIRO2, HadCM3,140\nCGCM2, ECHAM and PCM) using the same emission scenarios. An approach involving141\ndownscaling the HadCM3 outputs for each scenario was chosen in preference to using a142\nregional climate model (RCM) as previously used in South Africa (Hudson and Jones, 2002;143\nTadross et al., 2005) since these studies considered only one socioeconomic scenario (SRES144\nA2) for 2100. The challenges of choosing an appropriate GCM, a representative number of145\nemissions scenarios and time slices and the downscaling approach in order to capture an146\nappropriate degree of uncertainty in the modelling are considered under the methodological147\nlimitations section.148\nWhen downscaling, changes in climate need to be considered relative to a \u2018baseline\u2019. In this149\nstudy, a baseline climatology developed by the International Water Management Institute150\n(IWMI) was used (New et al., 2002). This 10\u2019 resolution dataset includes gridded mean151\nmonthly surface climate data, derived from observed data for 1961 to 1990, to match the152\nWorld Meteorological Organisation (WMO) standard. However, it is important to check that153\nthe baseline (historical) climate for a study site is consistent with the equivalent gridded154\n7baseline climatology data. For Mhlume, the historical baseline referred to 1969 to 1996. A155\ncomparison between Mhlume and the equivalent IWMI grid pixel (1961-90) using mean156\nmonthly data for rainfall and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is shown in Figure 2.157\nAlthough the time series are different, linear regression analyses showed a very high158\ncorrelation between the two datasets (Rainfall R2 = 0.96 and ETo R2 = 0.98) confirming that159\nthe IWMI baseline climatology was appropriate for the downscaling process.160\nIt is acknowledged that GCMs do not simulate the present climate perfectly, and that model161\nchanges predicted from the present to the future are generally more reliable than the present or162\nthe future climate predicted alone (Carter et al., 1994). Downscaling GCM outputs for the163\nstudy site was undertaken using a well established procedure using \u2018change factors\u2019 (Diaz-164\nNieto and Wilby, 2005). A baseline climatology for the site was first established. Changes in165\nthe equivalent climate variables for the GCM grid box closest to the target site (Mhlume)166\nwere calculated by taking the difference between the transient HadCM3 GCM runs with the167\nIWMI observed climate data from the 30 year baseline period (Table 2). Finally, these168\n\u2018change factors\u2019 (CF) were applied to the historical baseline \u2013 adding the changes in169\ntemperature to the observed temperature, and multiplying ratio changes for precipitation and170\nother variables (e.g. solar radiation, wind, ETo) by their observed daily values during the171\nperiod 1961-90 (Alexandrov and Hoogenboom, 2000). Two new datasets were generated, to172\nrepresent the future climate at Mhlume under each SRES scenario (2050_A2 and 2050_B2).173\nUsing this approach, all the daily climate values in each month are altered by the same174\npercentage, each day and in each year of record. This approach has the virtue of simplicity175\nand maintains a realistic temporal structure of climate data. It also assumes that the relative176\nvariability in climate from day to day and year to year (the shape of the frequency distribution)177\nremains constant. Whilst it is recognised that this is not necessarily true of future climate, it178\navoids introducing additional uncertainty into the analysis. Similar CF approaches for179\ndownscaling have been applied in the UK (Pilling and Jones, 1999), Bulgaria (Alexandrov180\n8and Hoogenboom, 2000), Spain (Rodriguez Diaz et al., 2007) and Sri Lanka (de Silva et al.,181\n2007). The historical baseline and perturbed future climate datasets for Mhlume were used as182\ninputs for the sugarcane crop modelling.183\n2.3 Modelling sugarcane yield and water use184\nFor simulating baseline and future sugarcane yield and irrigation needs, the CANEGRO185\nmodel was used; this is one of 16 crop models embedded within the DSSAT (v4.0) program186\n(Jones et al., 2003). A brief description of the CANEGRO model is given below, but readers187\ninterested in a detailed description are referred to Inman-Bamber (1991; 1995) and O\u2019Leary188\n(2000). The CANEGRO model was originally developed by the South African Sugar189\nAssociation Experiment Station (SASEX) to determine optimal harvest age because of risks190\nfrom the stalk borer Eldana sacchararina (Inman-Bamber, 1995). It has since been embedded191\ninto DSSAT and used in Africa (Inman-Bamber and Kiker, 1997), Asia (Jintrawet and192\nPrammanee, 2005) and America. The model contains carbon simulation, crop development,193\nenergy and water simulation components. Although it was coupled to a soil and plant nitrogen194\nmodel from the CERES-Maize model (Jones and Kiniry, 1986) in the DSSAT program this195\nhas not yet been validated, and hence CANEGRO remains a radiation-water-temperature196\nlimited model that takes no account of nutrient status (O\u2019Leary, 2000). The model has,197\nhowever, been extensively tested for simulating above ground biomass and water status for198\nNCo376, a popular cultivar grown in Swaziland. Keating et al (1995) has shown CANEGRO199\nto be robust for simulating biomass with water or nitrogen stress and Inman-Bamber (1994,200\n1995) reported on its application at two different locations. The model requires input data201\nrelating to the local weather, crop and soil characteristics, and management practices202\n(fertilizer and irrigation regimes) and runs on a daily time-step to calculate crop phasic and203\nmorphological development using temperature, day length and genetic characteristics. The204\nweather, crop and soil datasets and assumptions used for parameterising CANEGRO are205\noutlined below.206\n9Three weather datasets were used. A historical baseline dataset containing daily maximum207\nand minimum temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, rainfall, and relative humidity for208\nMhlume for 1969-1996, and two equivalent perturbed datasets for the SRES 2050_A2 and209\n2050_B2 scenario, respectively, as described previously. Crop modelling was based on210\nNCo376, a cultivar which is grown extensively in Swaziland. An analysis of RSSC field data211\nfor 1980-2007 showed that on average this variety accounts for 66% of the total cropped area.212\nThe study assumed a plant cane crop; however, in reality, sugarcane is ratooned and only a213\nsmall proportion (typically 10%) is plant cane. At Mhlume, over three-quarters (77%) of the214\nannual cropped area is ratooned cane aged 1 and 6 years (Figure 3). This was acknowledged215\nto be a methodological limitation as plant cane yields are higher than ratooned cane. However,216\nanalysis of RSSC field data actually showed that the average yield for plant cane was not217\nsignificantly different from ratooned cane aged 1-6 years (Figure 3). It was therefore assumed218\nthat simulating plant cane yield would provide a reasonable indication of \u2018typical\u2019 yield for219\ncane under both current and future climates.220\nPlanting and emergence dates were assumed to be identical. This is because in ratoon cane the221\nstems are cut to ground level and the stumps appear above ground, as in emergence. Normal222\npractice is to stagger planting in order to optimise cane supplies to the factory. For the223\nmodelling exercise, November planting was chosen as this coincides with higher temperatures224\nand rainfall (Figure 1) which is the ideal condition for germination and filleting (Doorenbos225\nand Kassam, 1979). The assumed irrigation method was furrow as this represented 52% of the226\nirrigated area in the region. An automatic irrigation schedule (defining the timing and amount227\nof irrigation) was chosen, with irrigation scheduled to return the soil back to field capacity228\nwhen the profile soil water content dropped below 65% of total available water. This is229\nassumed typical of current irrigation management practices in the region. Irrigation efficiency230\nwas assumed to be 100%, as net irrigation water requirements were being modelled, although231\nin practice surface irrigation efficiencies are considerably lower.232\n10\nAt RSSC, the soils are grouped into three classes ranging from good (1) to poor (3) in terms233\nof sugarcane suitability. For modelling, the fields were assumed to have \u2018R-set\u2019 soils. These234\nare Class 1 soils, equivalent to heavy textured Shortlands and Hutton Forms in the South235\nAfrican Binomial Soil Classification, with an effective rooting depth of 1 m and an available236\nwater capacity (AWC) of 140-180 mm m-1 (SASEX, 1999). They are defined as moderate to237\nwell structured red or reddish brown clay loam to clay soils with moderate organic matter238\ncontent, and usually occur in mid-slope positions on well draining gentle slopes (Nixon,239\n2006). They are one of the best soils, giving higher cane yields than other local soils240\n(Murdoch, 1968). An analysis of RSSC field data showed that 65% of the cropped area were241\non Class 1 soils, and 76% of all fields contained R-set soils.242\nThe CANEGRO model was parameterised and used to simulate annual sugarcane yield and243\nirrigation needs for a baseline \u2018scenario\u2019 using data from 1980-96. The model was then re-run244\nfor each SRES scenario (with and without CO2 fertilisation effects) using the same crop and245\nsoil files, but with the future climate datasets. For each year of simulation, model outputs246\nincluded biomass yield (t ha-1), sucrose yield (t ha-1), irrigation needs (mm), and water use247\nefficiency (WUE) defined as kilograms of sucrose production per cubic metre of irrigation248\nwater usefully applied (kg-1 m-3).249\n2.4 Model validation250\nIt is important to have confidence that a crop model can predict with reasonable accuracy251\nhistorical variations in yield, before imposing further uncertainty through climate change. The252\nCANEGRO model was used to simulate yields for 1980-96. For validation purposes, RSSC253\nfield data for the same period were obtained. These contained information on cane yield,254\nincluding variety, ratoon year, planting and harvest dates, and soil type (18,000 records in255\ntotal) on a field by field basis. From this, a validation dataset was produced (based on 1549256\nfields) containing yields for all fields growing plant cane (variety NCo376) on R-set soils. A257\n11\ncomparison between the CANEGRO modelled and RSSC observed cane yields was258\ncompleted (Figure 4). Visually, for most years, the modelled yield compared well to the259\naverage observed yield and within \u00b11 SD (as shown by the error bars). In some years, the260\nmodelled and observed average yields were very similar. To assess whether bias of modelled261\nyields versus observed yields were statistically significant, the model outputs were analysed262\nfor lack of fit (LOFIT) with the observed data using a method described by Whitmore (1991).263\nThis test was chosen in preference to more widely used goodness-of-fit statistics such as the264\ncorrelation coefficient (r) and root mean squared error (RMSE) because rather than265\ncomparing a single modelled value against a single observed value, it considers multiple266\nobserved values and differing numbers of observed values in a temporal series. The calculated267\nF value (1.50) was not significant, confirming there was no evidence to suggest that the268\nmodelled and observed data were statistically different.269\n2.5 Modelling agroclimate and irrigation demand270\nThe variables that directly influence soil moisture and hence irrigation are rainfall and271\nreference evapotranspiration (ETo). To assess the spatial impacts of climate variability on272\nsugarcane irrigation needs, an approach was needed to extrapolate the CANEGRO modelled273\noutputs for a single site (Mhlume) across Swaziland. Previous research has shown that a274\nstrong relationship exists between irrigation need and potential soil moisture deficit (PSMD)275\nfor a range of crops and climates, including rice in Sri Lanka (de Silva et al., 2007) and276\nhorticulture in Spain (Rodriguez Diaz et al., 2007). The advantage of this index over others277\nsuch as the Wetness Index (ratio of total annual rainfall and total annual evapotranspiration) is278\nthat the distribution of rainfall and ET throughout the year is taken into account. Furthermore,279\nin many African countries where spatial information is sparse or non-existent, the PSMD280\nagroclimate index is more appropriate than the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) which281\nrequires detailed spatial soils information (Narasimhan and Srinivasan, 2005). To assess282\nagroclimate (PSMD) variability across Swaziland a water balance model was used, working283\n12\nfrom mean monthly rainfall and ETo gridded data from the IWMI baseline climatology. The284\nPSMD for each grid pixel at the end of each month is calculated from:285\niiii PETPSMDPSMD \uf02d\uf02b\uf03d \uf02d1 [1]286\nWhere287\nPSMDi = potential soil moisture deficit in month i, mm288\nETi = reference evapotranspiration in month i, mm289\nPi = rainfall in month i, mm290\nAt the start of the sugarcane irrigation season the PSMD is assumed to be zero. In months291\nwhere Pi > (PSMDi-1 + ETi), no soil moisture deficit is assumed to occur and PSMDi = 0. In292\nSwaziland, soil moisture deficits start to build up each month as ET > P, peak in late summer293\n(August) and then continue through the autumn and winter. Therefore in Swaziland, the294\nestimation of PSMD starts with January as month i = 1. The maximum PSMD of the 12295\nmonths of the year is the PSMDmax for that grid pixel. A gridded dataset containing the296\nPSMDmax for each grid pixel at a resolution of 10 min latitude\/longitude (16 km x 16 km) for297\nSwaziland was produced.298\nA modified approach was required to generate an equivalent PSMDmax dataset for each SRES299\nscenario. This involved using a GIS to first downscale the HadCM3 GCM data from a grid300\nmesh of 2.5\u00b0 x 3.75\u00b0 (latitude by longitude) down to a 10 minute grid to match the IWMI301\nbaseline climatology (New et al., 2002) using a krigging interpolation technique. Tanser et al302\n(2003) used a similar approach to interpolate the future climate scenario surfaces to the303\nresolution of their long-term mean data using bilinear interpolation. The relative change304\nbetween the baseline and future for each scenario, grid pixel and climate variable was then305\ncalculated:306\njmbasHadCM\njmfutHadCM\njmv V\nV\nCF\n,__3\n,__3\n,_ \uf03d [2]307\n13\nWhere:308\nCFv_m,j is the change factor for variable v in month m for pixel j from the HadCM3 model;309\nVHadCM3_fut_m,j is the predicted value for a climate variable from the HadCM3 model, and;310\nVHadCM3_bas_m,j is the baseline value for a climate variable in the HadCM3 model.311\nUsing krigging interpolation techniques, the change factors calculated in Equation 2, were312\nthen interpolated to the grid pixels in the IWMI baseline climatology. The relative change313\nbetween the IWMI baseline climatology and the HadCM3 future scenario for each climate314\nvariable (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed and relative humidity) for315\neach month and grid pixel was then calculated. These \u2018change factors\u2019 were then applied to316\nthe IWMI baseline climatology to derive two future climate datasets at 10\u2019 resolution:317\nimbasimvimfut VCFV ,__'10,_,__'10 \uf0d7\uf03d [3]318\nWhere:319\nCFv_m,i is the interpolated change factor for variable v in month m and pixel i;320\nV10\u2019_bas is the pixel value for a climate variable in the IWMI baseline climatology, and;321\nV10\u2019_fut is the predicted value for a climate variable in the IWMI baseline climatology.322\nTwo datasets containing gridded PSMDmax values for each SRES scenario at 10\u2019 resolution323\nwere produced. Using a GIS, the PSMDmax data were classified and mapped to show the324\nspatial variability in agroclimate across Swaziland for the baseline and each SRES scenario.325\nTo assess the impacts of climate change on volumetric irrigation demand, a correlation326\nbetween irrigation need and agroclimate is necessary. One of the outputs from the327\nCANEGRO model is annual irrigation need (mm). Using Equation 1 and the climate data for328\nMhlume, the PSMDmax in each simulated year (1980-96) was calculated. A correlation329\nbetween annual PSMDmax and annual irrigation need was derived by linear regression analysis330\n14\n(Figure 5). Using a GIS, the PSMDmax dataset for Swaziland was combined with the331\nregression equation (Figure 5) to estimate the irrigation need (mm) in each grid pixel. Data on332\nthe location and cropped area (ha) of sugarcane in Swaziland was obtained and imported into333\nthe GIS. The volumetric irrigation demand (m3) was then calculated by multiplying the334\nreported sugarcane cropped area (ha) with the estimated irrigation need (mm) in each grid335\npixel. The total volumetric irrigation demand for sugarcane grown in Swaziland taking into336\naccount the agroclimate variability across the country, for the baseline and each SRES337\nscenario, was estimated.338\n3. Results and Discussion339\n3.1 Impacts on sugarcane yield and water use efficiency340\nThe estimated changes in sucrose, biomass yield and WUE from the baseline for each SRES341\nscenario (with CO2 fertilisation for the 2050_A2 SRES scenario) are summarised in Table 3.342\nWith climate change, relatively minor increases in productivity are estimated, principally due343\nto increased radiation levels and higher temperatures (1-6% and 10-29% above the baseline,344\nrespectively). This is consistent with Batchelor (1992) who observed trends of increasing345\ngrowth with increasing temperature. Whilst predicted increases in sucrose yield are small (2-346\n3%), ET was estimated to increase by between 11-14%. This results in a reduction in WUE by347\n10% for both SRES scenarios. However, when the CO2 concentration for the baseline (330348\nppmv) was increased (600 ppmv) for the 2050s, there was a noticeable increase in biomass349\nand sucrose yield. This is consistent with Watson et al. (1996) who reported that a doubling of350\nCO2 concentration from present levels would increase biomass by 10-30%. CO2 enrichment351\nof the atmosphere increases the rate of photosynthesis, and thus yields, and is expected to352\nreduce water use. In this study, the crop modelling suggests that sucrose yield under the SRES353\n2050_A2 scenario, with CO2 fertilisation would be 15% higher than the baseline yield. There354\nseems to be only a minor effect of CO2 fertilisation on WUE. According to Downing et al.355\n15\n(1997) a doubling of CO2 concentration may increase WUE by up to 50%, with stronger356\neffects for plants with C3 pathways. The 5% WUE increase in this study is low, and possibly357\ndue to sugarcane having a C4 pathway, which is less water-efficient.358\nThe beneficial effects of climate change on yield due to increased CO2 concentration might359\noffset the potentially negative impacts of increased irrigation need, particularly in countries360\nwhere water resources are scarce. Defining any increase in irrigation need is thus important,361\nbecause if the increase in irrigation need is accompanied by an increase in yield, then in362\nproducing a unit weight of economic yield, the same amount of water may still be used, or363\neven less. Therefore a net increase in irrigation will be when more irrigation water is required364\nfor the same unit weight of yield (defined as a standard yield). Figure 6 shows the ranked365\nannual irrigation needs for the baseline and each future scenario for a \u2018standard\u2019 yield. The366\n\u2018standard\u2019 yield is defined as one obtained when the crop has no limitations of water. The367\nresults show that for all scenarios, there is an average increase in irrigation need from the368\nbaseline of between 19-21%. However, with CO2 fertilisation, the increase in irrigation need369\nis nearly halved (9%).370\n3.2 Impacts on sugarcane irrigation water requirements371\nThe predicted changes in seasonal irrigation need (depths applied, mm) from the baseline for372\neach SRES scenario are summarised in Figure 6. The crop modelling suggested an increase in373\ncrop water requirement (ETcrop) of between 11-14% (Table 3). With climate change, the374\ncombined effect of reduced summer rainfall and increased evapotranspiration rates, results in375\nan increase in average irrigation need of 22-26%, depending on scenario. This could have376\nmajor implications for both existing sugarcane plantations and new developments because377\nirrigation schemes (pipe distribution and canal networks, and application equipment) are378\ndesigned to meet a certain \u2018peak\u2019 daily and seasonal need. Designing for an \u2018average\u2019 year379\nwould result in under-capacity in dry years when returns from irrigation are highest. Similarly,380\n16\ndesigning for the driest year would lead to unnecessarily large pipes and canals and would be381\nuneconomical. Hence most irrigation schemes are designed to meet peak need for a \u2018design\u2019382\ndry usually defined as a return period equivalent to an 80% probability of non-exceedance.383\nHowever, with increasing reliance on irrigation to attain high quality production (rather than384\njust yield increment), combined with concerns regarding the increased likelihood of future dry385\nyears, many new irrigation schemes are now being designed to cope with more extreme386\nevents (greater than the 80% probability of non-exceedance). Figure 6 shows the potential387\nincrease in \u2018design\u2019 dry year need from the baseline for each scenario. The important point is388\nthat a future \u2018average\u2019 year in irrigation terms could well be more akin to a current \u2018design\u2019389\ndry year, meaning that with climate change future peak irrigation needs could well exceed390\ncurrent design criteria for existing irrigation schemes, and in approximately 50% of years.391\n3.3 Impacts on agroclimate and irrigation demand392\nThe spatial variability in agroclimate for the baseline and each SRES scenario are shown in393\nFigure 7. For the baseline, the agroclimate zones show a strong north-south delineation, with394\nthe highest aridity values observed in the west around Big Bend (700-800 mm) then declining395\nwestwards towards Malkerns (300-400 mm). The highest aridity values correspond to where396\nirrigation needs are highest. With climate change, the zones of highest aridity are predicted to397\nincrease in area and magnitude, moving further north towards the sugarcane growing areas of398\nMhlume and Simunye. Under both SRES scenarios, major changes in the spatial variability in399\nagroclimate are predicted, with large regions of the country predicted to experience conditions400\nmore arid than those currently experienced anywhere in the country.401\nFor the baseline, the total theoretical volumetric irrigation water demand is estimated to be402\n24138 x 106 m3 year-1, with nearly three quarters (72%) concentrated within three production403\nareas of Mhlume, Simunye, and Big Bend. With climate change, the volumetric irrigation404\ndemand in these areas is projected to increase by 18-21%. This could have major405\n17\nrepercussions on other abstractors, particularly in water scarce and trans-boundary catchments.406\nFor example, Nkomo and van der Berg (2004) investigated water availability and abstraction407\nin the Komati river basin, which is shared by Swaziland, South Africa and Mozambique, and408\nwhere irrigated sugarcane constitutes the dominant land use. They investigated the impacts of409\ntwo new dams on water reliability, and found that improved water supply for irrigation in410\nSwaziland and South Africa had been achieved. However, they reported that future water411\ndemands in 2015 even without climate change would result in appreciable shortages for412\nirrigation. The preferred adaptation options included increasing irrigation efficiency (from413\nsurface to micro-irrigation) and reducing the sugarcane cropped area in favour of other less414\nwater demanding higher value crops, including horticulture and flowers.415\n5. Methodological limitations416\nInevitably, the approaches developed in this study which have linked climate, crop and GIS417\nmodelling have numerous limitations. The crop and agroclimate modelling were based on one418\nGCM, two scenarios and one time-slice. Although the HadCM3 and SRES scenarios (A2, B2)419\nhave previously been used in various African studies (Hulme et al., 2001) a more detailed420\nassessment would need to consider a range of GCM outputs (to account for individual model421\nerror), additional time slices (2030s, 2080s) and the full ensemble of SRES scenarios (to422\nconsider alternative demographic, socio-economic and technological changes). By423\nconsidering only one GCM the level of uncertainty in the model outputs cannot be easily424\nquantified. For example, the ECHAM4 GCM has been shown to significantly increase425\npredicted changes in irrigation demand for some regions compared to the HadCM3 GCM426\n(Doll, 2002).427\nArnell et al (2003) analysed different ways of constructing climate change scenarios using428\noutput from three climate models (HadRM3H, HadCM3, HadAM3H). Sixteen scenarios were429\nconstructed, representing different combinations of model scale (GCM, RCM), whether the430\n18\nsimulations were used directly or changes were applied to an observed baseline, and whether431\nobserved or simulated variations from year-to-year were used. The different ways of deriving432\nclimate scenarios resulted in a range in change in average annual runoff of between 10-20%433\nby 2071-2100, depending on the model and approach used. Using a regional climate model434\nover-estimated rainfall across much of southern Africa and resulted in excessive simulated435\nrunoff. This led to smaller estimates of change in future runoff than when changes in climate436\nwere applied to an observed climate baseline. Arnell et al (2003) concluded that it was437\npreferable to apply modelled changes in climate to observed data to construct climate438\nscenarios (as used in this study) rather than derive these directly from the regional climate439\nmodel (RCM) simulations.440\nAlthough there has been a marked increase in the number of RCM simulations, very few441\nstudies have been conducted over southern Africa as most research institutions in this region442\nlack access to the necessary technology. Regional models, such as HadRM3 are also able to443\nresolve tropical cyclones, which affect eastern tropical regions of southern Africa in summer.444\nThe hydrological cycle is stronger in the RCM, with consequent increases in the intensity of445\nrainfall, in the magnitude of the moisture fluxes and in soil moisture compared to the driving446\nGCM (Hudson and Jones, 2002). Further studies should therefore investigate the differences447\nin climate change signal derived from using a suitable RCM compared against using448\nestablished GCM outputs to provide a better assessment of the uncertainty associated with the449\nclimate change modelling aspects of this work. Linked to this, is the method of downscaling.450\nIn this study, a popular approach using change factors (CF) was used, but this has limitations451\ncompared to statistical downscaling (SD) using transfer functions and stochastic weather452\ngenerators (Diaz-Nieto and Wilby, 2005). The problem is that the future temporal pattern of453\nwet and dry days remains unchanged, and so changes in the intensity and frequency of rainfall454\nevents can not be investigated. Further studies should consider using an alternative SD455\napproach which would allow more detailed analysis of climate change uncertainty and456\n19\nexploration of temporal sequencing of meteorological events (e.g. droughts, rainfall). The457\neffect of different resolution between the HadCM3 model (2.5 x 3.75 degrees) and the IWMI458\nbaseline climatology (10' latitude\/longitude) datasets, and choice of interpolation may also459\nhave introduced some distortion. Finally, the GCM outputs were used to generate future460\ndatasets based on predicted \u2018average\u2019 changes in climate. However, in agricultural irrigation,461\na statistically defined \u2018design\u2019 dry year with a defined probability of non-exceedance is used,462\nrather than an \u2018average\u2019 year. The predicted future \u2018average\u2019 irrigation needs presented in this463\nstudy are thus likely to significantly under-estimate future \u2018dry\u2019 year irrigation demand.464\nThe crop model outputs are of course sensitive to model parameterisation. Further modelling465\nwould benefit from a sensitivity analysis of the key variables known to influence water use466\nand cane yield, including modifying crop characteristics to capture the effects of varying467\nplanting dates for different ratooned cane, simulating different soil types (textures and depths),468\nassessing the proportion of effective rainfall, and assessing the impacts of different irrigation469\nscheduling strategies to reflect either traditional (furrow) or more efficient (micro) application470\nmethods. Modelling could also investigate the impacts of future changes in reliability of water471\nsupply; this study assumed unconstrained demand, but reducing the availability of water for472\nirrigation at differing times during the season (for example, due to low flows or seasonal473\ndroughts) would impact on cane development and yield.474\n6. Conclusions475\nTo produce a unit weight of sucrose equivalent to current optimum levels of production,476\nfuture irrigation needs were predicted to increase by 20-22%. With CO2-fertilisation, the477\nimpacts of climate change are offset by higher crop yields, such that IRnet is predicted to478\nincrease by 9%. The study showed that with climate change, the current peak capacity of479\nexisting irrigation schemes could fail to meet the predicted increases in irrigation demand in480\nnearly 50% of years assuming unconstrained water availability.481\n20\nGIS modelling confirmed that climate change will impact strongly on the spatial variability in482\nagroclimate and hence demand for irrigation. Although the study was based on only one483\nGCM, and considered a limited number of scenarios, these preliminary findings do highlight484\nsome of the potential risks that climate change could impose on sugarcane production in485\nSouthern Africa. The approaches developed in this paper and results serve to provide a useful486\nbaseline from which more detailed investigations should be undertaken, from which more487\nstrategic interventions, including adaptations could then be planned.488\nAcknowledgements489\nThe authors acknowledge the financial support of the Marshal Papworth Fund, the Royal490\nSwaziland Sugar Corporation (RSSC) for provision of extensive field datasets for model491\nvalidation, and guidance from by Dr. Tim Hess and Mrs. Pat Belamy regarding statistical492\nanalysis.493\nReferences494\nAllen, R.G., Pereira, L.S., Raes, D., and Smith, M.
