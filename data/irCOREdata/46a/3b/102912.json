One of the key parameters in the FN model is \nthe local extraction field, which is usually very difficult \nto determine for real experimental setups.  \nConsequently the field enhancement (i.e. the ration \nbetween the extraction and the macroscopic applied \nfield) emerged as a necessary fitting parameter.  The \ndiscovery of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and other high \naspect ratio structures introduced important \nsupplementary difficulties when implementing the FN \nformalism.  One such problem is the influence of the \nelectronic structure on the FE process [1-4].  Other \nunique situations arise when the anode is moved very \nclose to the emitter\u2019s tip, at distances comparable to its \nradius [5, 6] when structural changes to the potential energy barrier to the vacuum are likely \nto appear.  In order to account for all these effects, a detailed model of the electron transfer \nfrom a CNT into the vacuum is needed. \n In the present work, we consider a system of a grounded CNT of length L and radius \nr0 (the emitter) facing a spherical anode of radius Ra (Ra>>r0).  The anode is placed at some \ndistance away from the emitter\u2019s \ntip.  The CNT is modelled as a \ntwo-dimensional (2D) manifold \nwhere electrons behave as quasi-\nfree and independent particles [3, \n4].  The electrons are bound on \nthe CNT surface by a one-\ndimensional (1D) potential well, \ndue to the restriction imposed by \nthe cylindrical symmetry.  The \npotential energy of the quasi-free \nelectrons takes an overall \nposition independent value of \u2013\nW0 (the origin of the energy scale \nis taken at the Fermi level).

To this \npurpose, the CNT cap is simplified as a grounded conducting sphere of radius r0, facing the \nanode on the same symmetry axis (Fig. 1).  As the emitter-anode distance, d and the anode \nradius, Ra are much greater than r0, the electric field in vacuum may be computed using the \nmethod of electrostatic images.  The electric potential follows then by integrating the field \nalong convenient paths connecting the grounded cathode to any arbitrary point in space.  The \nnon-electrostatic energy jump, \u03c7, at r=r0 is taken into account as a separate parameter.  Using \nthis potential energy scheme, the solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the 2D CNT \nmanifold [3, 4] are connected to the 3D ones in vacuum, which obey the radiating boundary \ncondition.  Having found the electronic \nwave function, the radial component of the \nprobability current density in vacuum can be \ncomputed and from there the emission \ncurrent follows allowing for a comparison to \nexperimental current-voltage (I-V) \ndiagrams.  A set of data measured for \nseveral anode-to-cathode separations was \nused in the present analysis. The first \napproach was to keep a fixed vacuum \nbarrier height and fit the experimental data \nwith the enhancement factor only.  As no \nconsistent results have been obtained a \nsecond approach was tried: allowing the \nvacuum barrier height to vary with the \nanode-to-cathode separation as a fitting \nparameter in the aforementioned electrostatic model.  The fitting results are presented in Fig. \n2.  The best fit values of the barrier height for different anode-to-cathode separations are \npresented in Fig. 3.  It may be concluded that when the anode gets closer to the emitter its \nelectronic behaviour is perturbed and the barrier height tends to decrease.  This may be an \neffect of local transitory ionizations of atoms at the CNT tip. Obviously, the change in the \nlocal field enhancement may also play an important role in this phenomenon, but the purpose \nof the present analysis is to emphasize the possibility of variation of the barrier height in such \ncircumstances, an aspect which is usually overlooked in current FN approaches. \n \nReferences \n[1] K.
