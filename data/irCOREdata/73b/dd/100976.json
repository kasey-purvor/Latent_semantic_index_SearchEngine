These scaling properties\nindicate on what scale local temperatures may be meaningfully de\ufb01ned as intensive variables.\nThis question is particularly relevant for non-equilibrium scenarios such as heat conduction, etc.\nIntroduction. \u2013 Thermodynamics has successfully been applied to the description of\nmacroscopic systems since more than a century. For that reason this theory enjoys widespread\nacceptance. Nevertheless, its microscopic foundation is, in most cases, not well understood.\nThe theory of thermodynamics is based on the notions of extensive and conjugate intensive\nthermodynamic variables. The existence of the thermodynamical limit in a mathematical\nsense has been shown for many fundamental cases [1\u20133]. The standard proofs are based\non the idea that, as the spatial extension increases, the surface of a region in space grows\nslower than its volume. If the interaction potential is short-ranged enough, one can show that\nthe \u201ce\ufb00ective\u201d interactions between one region and another become negligible in the limit of\nin\ufb01nite size, implying extensivity.\nHowever, the scaling behavior of the interactions with the size of those regions has, to our\nknowledge, not been studied in any detail yet. While it has been shown that they vanish in\nthe thermodynamical limit, it remains unclear what happens in situations that are in some\nsense only close to this limit. There is not even a precise understanding of what \u201cclose\u201d means\nin that case.\nc\u00a9 EDP Sciences\n614 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\nFor standard applications of thermodynamics, this might not pose any serious problem\nsince the number of particles within any region is so large that deviations from in\ufb01nite systems\nmay safely be neglected. Nevertheless, the di\ufb00erences should become important when the\nconsidered regions are signi\ufb01cantly smaller. It is here where a quantum approach becomes\nimperative [4].\nThe applicability of thermodynamical concepts to mesoscopic or even microscopic systems\nhas intensively been discussed in recent years [5], since nano-scale physics has attracted in-\ncreased attention [6]. Due to the advance of experimental techniques, the measurement of\nthermodynamic quantities like temperature with a spatial resolution on the nanometer scale\nseems within reach [6\u20139]. These techniques have already been applied for a new type of scan-\nning microscopy, using a temperature sensor [10, 11], that shows resolutions below 100 nm.\nAn important question thus arises [6]: Down to what spatial scale does a meaningful notion\nof temperature exist at all?\nIn this paper we consider a quantum system of \ufb01xed Hilbert-space dimension dim, com-\nposed of identical elementary n-level subsystems. We form nG identical groups of N subsys-\ntems each (dim = nnGN ) and show that the interaction strength between the groups scales\ninversely proportional to\n\u221a\nN . Based on this scaling relation and assuming the total system to\nbe in a thermal state, we analyse for what group size N a thermodynamical description of the\nindividual group is appropriate. The results are con\ufb01rmed by numerical studies for a chain of\n8 spins. For this chain, partitions into two 4-spin-groups, four 2-spin-groups and eight single\nspins are considered.\nScaling law. \u2013 We consider a chain of identical n-level systems with identical nearest-\nneighbour interactions. The Hamiltonian of such a linear chain may be written as\nH =\n\u2211\nj\nhloc(j) + hint(j, j + 1), (1)\nwhere the index j labels the elementary subsystems. The local terms hloc(j) and the nearest-\nneighbour interactions hint(j, j + 1) have the form [12]:\nhloc(j) =\nn\n2\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nA\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1(j),\nhint(j, j + 1) =\nn2\n4\n\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2\nC\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3\u03b1(j)\u03c3\u03b2(j + 1). (2)\nHere, the \u03c3\u03b1(j) are SU(n) generators with \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, 2, . . . , n2 \u2212 1, n being the dimension of\none subsystem. For the SU(n) generators we adopt the trace relations [12]:\nTr[\u03c3\u03b1(i)] = 0,\nTr\n[\n\u03c3\u03b1(i)\u03c3\u03b2(j)\n]\n= 2\ndim\nn\n\u03b4ij\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 , (3)\nwhere the trace (Tr) has to be taken over the whole system of dimension dim. As a conse-\nquence, the trace over one elementary subsystem reads: Trj [\u03c3\u03b1(j)\u03c3\u03b2(j)] = 2\u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 . The coe\ufb03-\ncients in eq. (2) are then given by A\u03b1 = Tr(H\u03c3\u03b1(i))\/dim and C\u03b1\u03b2 = Tr(H\u03c3\u03b1(i)\u03c3\u03b2(i+1))\/dim,\nrespectively, and taken to be independent of i. We assume periodic boundary conditions and\nH to be traceless.\nIf we now form nG groups of N subsystems each, we can split the Hamiltonian H into\ntwo parts,\nH = H(0)N + IN , (4)\nM. Hartmann et al.: Scaling behavior of interactions etc. 615\nwhere H(0)N is the sum of the Hamiltonians of the individual groups and IN describes the\ninteraction between each group and its nearest neighbour,\nIN =\n\u2211\ni\nhint(iN, iN + 1). (5)\nWe label the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian H and its energies by Greek indices and\neigenstates and energies of the group Hamiltonian H(0)N by Latin indices, i.e.\nH|\u00b5\u3009 = E\u00b5|\u00b5\u3009 and H(0)N |jN \u3009 = EjN |jN \u3009. (6)\nObviously, the |jN \u3009 are simply products of group eigenstates. We now proceed to compare\ntwo characteristic quantities of the system according to eq. (4).\nFirst, consider the identity\u2211\n\u00b5\n(\nE\u00b5 \u2212 EjN\n)2|\u3008jN |\u00b5\u3009|2 = \u3008jN |I2N |jN \u3009, (7)\nwhere the left-hand side can be interpreted as the mean-squared energy distance between a\nlevel E\u00b5 and the energy EjN . The average of eq. (7) over all jN is identical with I\n2\nN , where\nIN \u2261\n\u221a\nTr\n(\nI2N\n)\ndim\n=\nn\n2\n\u221a\nnG\n\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2\nC2\u03b1\u03b2 . (8)\nHere we have used eq. (3).\nThe second quantity of interest is the width of the distribution of the energy levels of the\ntotal system \u03b4E around the mean energy E = Tr(H)\/dim = 0:\n\u03b4E \u2261\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u2211\n\u03bd\n(\nE\u03bd \u2212 E\n)2\ndim\n=\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221aTr [(H \u2212 E )2]\ndim\n=\n\u221a\nN\nn\n2\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221anG\n(\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2\nC2\u03b1\u03b2 +\n2\nn\n\u2211\n\u03b1\nA2\u03b1\n)\n. (9)\nHere we have again used eq. (3). Combining eqs. (8) and (9), we get the following scaling law:\nIN \u2264 1\u221a\nN\n\u03b4E. (10)\nNote that this law is a property of the Hamiltonian (1) and does not depend on the state of the\nsystem. The equality sign applies, if the local terms vanish, A\u03b1 = 0. Equation (10) does not\ndepend on the convention used in eq. (3), since normalisations cancel. It is straightforward to\nsee that the same scaling law holds for a three-dimensional lattice with cubes of N3 subsystems\nas the subgroups.\nRelation (10) has been derived here for a perfectly homogenous system. However, it\nis evident by means of stationary perturbation theory that it still holds approximately for\nsystems with small disorder.\nDistributions. \u2013 We now use the scaling law (10) to estimate the density matrix elements\nof the groups of N subsystems assuming that the total system is in a thermal state with the\ndensity matrix\n\u3008\u00b5|\u03c1\u02c6|\u03bd\u3009 = e\n\u2212\u03b2E\u00b5\nZ\n\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd (11)\n616 EUROPHYSICS LETTERS\nin the eigenbasis of H. Here, Z is the partition sum and \u03b2 = (kBT )\u22121 the inverse temperature.\nTransforming the density matrix (11) into the eigenbasis of H(0)N , we obtain\n\u3008j|\u03c1\u02c6|j\u3009 =\n\u2211\n\u00b5\n|\u3008j|\u00b5\u3009|2 e\n\u2212\u03b2E\u00b5\nZ\n=\ne\u2212\u03b2Ej\nZ\n\u2211\n\u00b5\n|\u3008j|\u00b5\u3009|2 exp [\u2212 \u03b2(E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej)] (12)\n(for simplicity we skip the index N from now on).\nA thermodynamical description of the groups of N subsystems by canonical density ma-\ntrices with the same inverse temperature \u03b2 is appropriate, if \u3008j|\u03c1\u02c6|j\u3009 was approximately pro-\nportional to exp[\u2212\u03b2Ej ]. Truncating the sum to terms with \u03b2|E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej | \b 1 (which will be\nmotivated below), we can expand the second exponential in the rhs of eq. (12) into a Taylor\nseries around Ej up to second order,\n\u3008j|\u03c1\u02c6|j\u3009 \u2248 e\n\u2212\u03b2Ej\nZ\n(\n1\u2212 \u03b2\u3008j|I|j\u3009+ \u03b2\n2\n2\n\u3008j|I2|j\u3009\n)\n, (13)\nwhere we have used\n\u2211\n\u00b5E\u00b5|\u3008j|\u00b5\u3009|2 = Ej + \u3008j|I|j\u3009 and eq. (7). The second-order term has to\nbe taken into account, since the sum over all energies E\u00b5 adds up positive and negative\ncontributions for the \ufb01rst-order terms but only positive ones for the second-order terms.\nSince \u3008j|I|j\u30092 \u2264 \u3008j|I2|j\u3009, both correction terms are small if\n\u03b2\n\u221a\n\u3008j|I2|j\u3009 \b 1. (14)\nEquation (14) justi\ufb01es the above truncation if the distribution wj(\u00b5) = |\u3008j|\u00b5\u3009|2 times the\ndensity of states \u03b7(E\u00b5 \u2212Ej) decayed faster than exp[\u2212\u03b2|E\u00b5 \u2212Ej |] for |E\u00b5 \u2212Ej | >\n\u221a\u3008j|I2|j\u3009\nand \ufb01xed j. We numerically veri\ufb01ed this behavior for a class of systems as shown in \ufb01g. 2\nbelow. If, on the other hand, the truncation of the sum was not possible, the rhs of eq. (13)\nwould contain additional correction terms invalidating a local thermodynamical description.\nIn the basis |j\u3009, the o\ufb00-diagonal elements of the density matrix \u2211\u00b5\u3008j|\u00b5\u3009\u3008\u00b5|j\u2032\u3009 exp[\u2212\u03b2E\u00b5]\nvanish for |Ej \u2212 Ej\u2032 | > 2I because |\u3008j|\u00b5\u3009\u3008\u00b5|j\u2032\u3009| \u2248 0. When |Ej \u2212 Ej\u2032 | < 2I, one can use the\nsame approximation as for the diagonal terms, where now the zeroth-order term is zero. In\nthe \ufb01rst- and second-order corrections each term of the sum carries a phase and thus these\ncorrections are smaller than for diagonal elements.\nCombining eqs. (10) and (14) we thus conclude that the condition\n\u221a\nN \n \u03b2\u03b4E (15)\nis su\ufb03cient to allow for an approximate local thermodynamical description for a group size N .\nIn eq. (15) we have used that I\n2\nis the arithmetic mean of all \u3008j|I2|j\u3009: these are positive quan-\ntities and therefore \u03b2I \b 1 implies \u03b2\u221a\u3008j|I2|j\u3009 \b 1 for almost all states |j\u3009. Equation (15) is\nthe main result of our paper.\nNumerical results. \u2013 To test the condition (15) and the approximations involved, we\ninvestigate a chain of 8 spins with a Hamiltonian of the form (1) rewritten as\nH =\n\u2206E\n2\n8\u2211\nj=1\n\u03c3z(j) + \u03bb\n8\u2211\nj=1\n3\u2211\n\u03b1,\u03b2=1\nc\u03b1\u03b2\u03c3\u03b1(j)\u03c3\u03b2(j + 1). (16)\nWithout loss of generality, we restrict the local part to terms in \u03c3z only; di\ufb00erent local terms\nwould merely imply a rotation of the coordinate system. Periodic boundary conditions are\nM.

In the following all energies (i.e. \u03bb, \u03b2\u22121) will be taken to be in terms of \u2206E.\nFor each realisation the matrix elements c\u03b1\u03b2 are randomly chosen from the interval [\u22121, 1]\nwith equal weight. Based on 100 such realisations, we \ufb01nd the average of \u03b4E to be \u2248 5\u03bb.\nTherefore, from eq. (15), a local thermodynamical description is expected to be appropriate\nfor\n\u221a\nN\/(\u03b2\u03bb)\n 5.\nWe consider three di\ufb00erent partitions of this system into groups of adjoining subsystems\nas described in eq. (4). The partitions are: two 4-spin-chains, four 2-spin-chains and eight\nsingle spins. For the inverse temperature of the total system \u03b2 and the interaction strength \u03bb\nwe consider the values \u03b2\u03bb = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 which implies 2.5 \u2264 \u221aN\/(\u03b2\u03bb) \u2264 20.\nFirst, we test the scaling behavior of the interaction, eq. (10). In \ufb01g. 1 we have plotted\nthe ratio I\/\u03b4E (see eqs. (8) and (9)) for the three partitions and 1\/\n\u221a\nN for comparison.\nThe result con\ufb01rms eq. (10). The values are slightly smaller than 1\/\n\u221a\nN , which is due to the\nneglect of the local terms of the Hamiltonian.\nThen, we calculate wj(\u00b5)\u03b7(E\u00b5\u2212Ej) for all three partitions. For each j we have plotted the\ndistribution wj(\u00b5)\u03b7(E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej) vs. x = (E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej)\/\n\u221a\u3008j|I2|j\u3009 thus rescaling its width to unity.\nFigure 2 shows a superposition of all these plots for one realisation. For comparison we have\nplotted in the range where |E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej | >\n\u221a\u3008j|I2|j\u3009, the functions 0.25 exp[\u2212\u03b2|E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej |] =\n0.25 exp[\u22120.5|x|], taking \u03b2\u221a\u3008j|I2|j\u3009 = 0.5 < 1. The normalisation 0.25 was deliberately\nchosen to show that the distribution wj(\u00b5)\u03b7(E\u00b5 \u2212 Ej) indeed decays fast enough in that\nrange. All numerical tests we made showed such a behavior.\nLet us now assume the whole system to be in a thermal state with a reciprocal temper-\nature \u03b2 and a density matrix according to eq. (11).

(15).\nFinally, to further con\ufb01rm our \ufb01ndings, we calculate a \u201cspectral temperature\u201d of each\nsubgroup in the following way [13]: The canonical density matrix of the whole system is\ntransformed into the product basis (6). To each pair of states formed by an excited energy\nlevel Ei and the ground level E0 of a subgroup, one can then assign a Boltzmann factor with\nan inverse temperature \u03b2\u2032. The spectral temperature is the sum of all these \u03b2\u2032 weighted by\nthe occupation probability pi of the excited level Ei:\n\u03b2spec \u2261 \u2212\n\u2211\ni>0\npi\n1\u2212 p0\nln(pi)\u2212 ln(p0)\nEi \u2212 E0 . (19)\nSuch a \u03b2spec can be de\ufb01ned for any state and coincides with the thermodynamical \u03b2 for a\ncanonical state. Since periodic boundary conditions were assumed, all subgroups of the same\nsize N have the same temperature. In \ufb01g. 4 the ratios between \u03b2spec de\ufb01ned by eq. (19) and the\ninverse temperature of the total system \u03b2 are plotted vs. group size N . Here the points, which\nful\ufb01ll our criteria, lie above 0.9, which again con\ufb01rms our results. The spectral temperatures of\nthe subgroups are, in general, higher than the temperature of the total system. This indicates\nthat the state of a subgroup is more mixed than the state of the whole system, which may be\ndue to the entanglement of the subgroups caused by their mutual interaction [14].\nConclusion. \u2013 We have studied a modular system of \ufb01xed size composed of elementary\nsubsytems with a \ufb01nite energy spectrum and nearest-neighbour interactions. We have shown\nthat if one forms groups of N subsystems each, the interaction between neighbouring groups\nscales as N\u22121\/2. We have then considered a chain of such interacting subsystems in a global\nthermal state with canonical density matrix. We have argued that due to the scaling property\nM. Hartmann et al.: Scaling behavior of interactions etc. 619\nof the interaction, the reduced density matrix of each group may be approximated by a\ncanonical one with the same temperature as that of the total density matrix, if\n\u221a\nN \n \u03b2\u03b4E:\nThe temperature becomes an intensive quantity on a coarse-grained size and length-scale only.\nIn the same way, energy becomes more and more extensive as the group size increases.\nWe have tested this assertion numerically with a chain of 8 interacting spins and \ufb01nd that\nour predictions are met in spite of the still small size of the total system.\nOur studies should be extended to the total system being in a local thermodynamical\nequilibrium only. Here, heat conduction [6, 15] becomes an interesting problem. For strong\ncoupling, meaningful temperature pro\ufb01les can be de\ufb01ned with limited resolution only [16].\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nWe thank M. Michel, H. Schmidt, M. Stollsteimer, and F.
