For animal-pollinated spe-\ncies with granular pollen, typically !1% of the pollen that\npollinators remove from flowers reaches conspecific stig-\nmas (Harder and Johnson 2008). In addition, pollen ex-\nport and import vary extensively among plants and among\nflowers within plants (Waser and Price 1984; Thomson\n1986). For example, Herrera (2002) estimated that roughly\n* Corresponding author; e-mail: s.a.richards@durham.ac.uk.\n\u2020 Present address: Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis,\nCalifornia 95616.\nAm.

All rights reserved.\nDOI: 10.1086\/603626\nhalf of the variance in the number of pollen tubes in\nHelleborus foetidus pistils sampled from 29 populations in\nthree regions of the Iberian Peninsula arose from differ-\nences among flowers on individual plants. In general, var-\niation in pollen dispersal by animals arises from three\nsources: differences in pollinator visitation, differences\namong pollinators, and stochastic variation during dis-\npersal by individual pollinators. Visitation differences arise\nfrom both intrinsic differences in a plant\u2019s or flower\u2019s at-\ntractiveness, such as flower and display size, and variation\nin the local density of conspecifics and other plant species\nthat compete for pollinators or facilitate their attraction\n(e.g., Ohashi and Yahara 2001; Bell et al. 2005; Grindeland\net al. 2005; Ghazoul 2006; Hegland and Boeke 2006; Ishii\nand Harder 2006). Relevant differences among pollinators\nof the same or different species include average pollen\nremoval and deposition per visit, the average incidence\nand intensity of processes that cause pollen loss during\ntransport (e.g., grooming), and the frequency and distance\nof movement within and among plants (e.g., Wilson and\nThomson 1991; Stone 1996; Castellanos et al. 2003;\nFumero-Caba\u00b4n and Mele\u00b4ndez-Ackerman 2007). Finally,\nstochastic variation in pollen removal, loss, and deposition\nas individual pollinators carry pollen from one flower or\nplant to others can arise from differing pollinator position\nand visit duration and from variation in stigma and anther\npositions (Lertzman and Gass 1983; Waser and Price 1984;\nThomson 1986; Morris et al. 1994; Cresswell 1999). Cu-\nriously, although the causes of variation in pollen dispersal\nare widely recognized, its ecological and evolutionary con-\nsequences have received little attention (although see\nLertzman and Gass 1983; Galen and Rotenberry 1988;\nBurd 1995; Harder and Wilson 1998).\nVariation in pollen dispersal can affect the expected fe-\nmale and male success of plants if seed production and\nsiring success vary nonlinearly with pollen deposition on\nstigmas (e.g., Wilson and Harder 2003). This association\narises because of Jensen\u2019s inequality (Jensen 1906; also see\nSmallwood 1996; Ruel and Ayres 1999; Pa\u00b4sztor et al. 2000),\naccording to which the mean outcome of a nonlinear func-\nConsequences of Pollination Variation 383\nFigure 1: Effect of variation in pollen receipt (X-axis) on the number\nof pollen tubes at the base of the style (Y-axis) for Chamerion angusti-\nfolium and the consequences for Jensen\u2019s inequality. The solid regression\nline represents the maximum likelihood fit of ,\u00010.00164xy\u02c6p 216.6(1\u0001 e )\nassuming a negative binomial error distribution. The straight solid line\nmaps the number of pollen tubes expected given average pollen receipt,\nwhereas the straight dashed lines map expected pollen tube numbers of\nflowers that received 700 fewer or more pollen grains than the mean.\nThe tick inside the Y-axis indicates the average of the latter two expec-\ntations, which is lower than the expected number of pollen tubes, as-\nsuming average pollen receipt (Jensen\u2019s inequality).\ntion with a variable input does not equal the value of the\nfunction for the mean input. For example, consider figure\n1, which depicts the relation of the number of pollen tubes\nat the base of Chamerion angustifolium styles to the num-\nber of pollen grains deposited on their stigmas (A. S. Nixon\nand L. D. Harder, unpublished data). Because this relation\ndecelerates strongly, the average number of pollen tubes\nfor two flowers that differ in pollen receipt by 700 grains\nabove and below the mean (midpoint between the two\ndashed horizontal lines) is 8% smaller than the number of\npollen tubes expected for the average pollen receipt (solid\nhorizontal line). More generally, the average number of\npollen tubes in all pistils is 13.2% smaller than expected\nfor the average pollen receipt. According to Jensen\u2019s in-\nequality, reduction in the average output of a nonlinear\nprocess owing to variation in input arises whenever the\noutput is a decelerating function of the input. Such re-\nlations probably commonly affect average reproductive\nperformance in plant populations because of nonlinear\n(decelerating) processes during pollen tube development\nin the style (fig. 1), competition among pollen tubes to\nfertilize limited ovules, competition among developing\nseeds for maternal resources, and competition among\nseeds for establishment sites (e.g., Waser and Price 1991;\nMitchell 1997; Aizen and Basilio 1998; Aizen and Harder\n2007; Harder et al. 2008). Together, such nonlinearities\nwill accentuate the effect of variation in pollen dispersal\non expected female and male performance. For example,\nWilson and Harder (2003) demonstrated theoretically that\nseparation of the sexes increases the spatial variance in\npollen dispersal compared with that experienced by her-\nmaphrodites, so Jensen\u2019s inequality greatly restricts the\nconditions under which a dioecious species can outcom-\npete a hermaphroditic species with otherwise similar re-\nproductive characteristics. Such effects bear consequences\nfor both the dynamics of plant populations and selection\non floral traits and sexual systems.\nDispersal variance arises as the aggregate outcome of\npollen transport by individual pollinators. During disper-\nsal of granular pollen, some pollen removed by a pollinator\nfrom a specific donor flower remains on the pollinator as\nit subsequently visits a series of recipient flowers. Depletion\nof donor pollen on the pollinator by loss during transport\nand deposition on recipient stigmas produces a generally\ndeclining trend in dispersal of donor pollen to successive\nrecipients (Harder and Barrett 1996). Bateman (1947) first\nmodeled this trend as a geometric decay process:\nv\u00011E[d ]p Dp(1\u0001 p) , (1)v\nwhere D is the total number of donor pollen grains even-\ntually deposited on recipient stigmas by a single pollinator,\nis the expected number of donor grains depositedE[d ]v\non the stigma of recipient flower in the visit sequence,v\nand p is the expected proportion of pollen remaining on\nthe pollinator that is deposited during each visit (depo-\nsition fraction; also the ratio of grains deposited on a\nstigma relative to those deposited on the stigma of the\nprevious recipient). Consequently, represents the av-1\u0001 p\nerage proportion of ultimately deposited pollen that is\ncarried over on the pollinator between flower visits (car-\nryover fraction; Morris et al. 1994). Subsequent analysis\nof pollen dispersal by bumblebees and hummingbirds sug-\ngested that average deposition commonly declined faster\nthan expected for geometric decay among the initial re-\ncipient flowers in a sequence but then persisted for more\nrecipients than expected (Morris et al. 1994; Harder and\nBarrett 1996). For analyses that consider the average num-\nber of pollen grains deposited on the first, second, and\nsubsequent recipients visited by a sample of pollinators\n(e.g., Harder and Barrett 1996), such apparently \u201clong-\ntailed\u201d dispersal could arise simply as an artifact of av-\neraging geometric decay processes governed by different\nparameters for each pollinator (Harder and Wilson 1998;\nappendix). Given this potential impact of between-\npollinator variation, analysis of pollen dispersal must con-\nsider individual rather than averaged sequences. Never-\ntheless, dispersal by individual pollinators could be more\ncomplicated than simple geometric decay because of pol-\n384 The American Naturalist\nlinator contact with stigmas of some flowers but not others\n(Lertzman and Gass 1983; Morris et al. 1995), pollinator\ngrooming during flights between flowers (Harder and Wil-\nson 1998), and the accumulation of pollen in layers on\npollinators\u2019 bodies (Morris et al. 1995; Harder and Wilson\n1998).\nIn this article, we consider three sources of variation in\npollen dispersal and their general consequences for plant\nmating: differences among pollinator types, differences\namong individual pollinators of the same type, and sto-\nchastic pollen deposition on flowers visited by individual\npollinators. This study is based on observations of pollen\ndispersal between donor and recipient plants of Brassica\nnapus L. cv. Westar by worker bumblebees (Bombus me-\nlanopygus Nylander) and male butterflies (Pieris rapae\n[L.]). We first derive a series of pollen dispersal models\nthat extend Bateman\u2019s model by explicitly depicting each\nof the three sources of variation. We then fit these models\nto our data and use model selection to identify which\nsources of variation contribute most to patterns of pollen\ndispersal. Pollen loss during transport could not be mea-\nsured, so after presenting the empirical results, we present\nsimulation results that assess the effects of loss on model\nfitting. On the basis of the empirical results, we then ex-\namine the implications of variation among and within\npollinators on plant mating with a numerical model. To-\ngether, our empirical and theoretical results provide guid-\nance on the analysis of pollen dispersal and, more im-\nportantly, expose new perspectives on the extent and\ncauses of dispersal variance, its consequences for average\nreproductive output in plant populations, and its potential\nroles in the evolution of floral characteristics.\nMaterial and Methods\nPlants and Pollinators\nTo study dispersal of Brassica napus pollen, we used in-\ndividual transgenic plants as pollen donors and wild-type\nplants as pollen recipients. Transgenic plants were selfed\nprogeny from a T1 transgenic line (Sta-44) containing a\ngenetic construct of the b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter\ngene (Jefferson et al. 1987) linked to a pollen-specific pro-\nmoter element (Hong et al. 1997). The construct, which\nis expressed in mature male gametophytes (pollen grains\nand pollen tubes), codes for b-glucuronidase, which\ncleaves b-d-glucuronide substrate, producing a blue pre-\ncipitate in the area of gene expression\u2014in our case, within\nthe pollen grain. All transgenic plants used in our exper-\niments contained multiple insertions of the GUS gene and\nwere screened to select only plants with strong and con-\nsistent blue color in all assayed pollen grains. Other than\nthe expression of blue color in pollen grains treated with\nsubstrate-containing reagent, the transgenic plants used in\nour experiments could not be distinguished from wild-\ntype plants.\nThe bumblebees used in our experiments were from a\nsingle colony initiated by a wild queen in a domicile\n(Hobbs et al. 1960). When the colony had about 30 work-\ners, we moved it to the laboratory and marked each worker\nby gluing a numbered plastic tag to its thorax. The bees\u2019\nnest box was placed inside a -m flight2# 2.75# 2.25\ncage, where workers had access to wild-type B. napus plants\nbetween experimental trials. We also provided the colony\nwith supplemental pollen and 50% sucrose solution.\nThe butterflies were from a captive colony maintained\nas described by Webb and Shelton (1988). Butterflies were\nmarked uniquely on their forewings with a felt-tipped pen.\nIndividuals used in experimental trials were first exposed\nto wild-type B. napus plants in a -m flight2# 1.5# 1.5\ncage. We used only male butterflies to eliminate interrup-\ntion of experimental trials due to oviposition.\nExperimental Protocol\nWe quantified pollen removal and dispersal in an indoor\nflight cage, illuminated brightly by 40-W, full-spectrum\nflorescent tubes, using zigzag arrays of potted B. napus\nplants, with one transgenic donor and a series of up to 10\nwild-type recipient plants. We ensured that the plants used\nduring our experiment had similar characteristics, except\nfor some experimental differences between trials with bees.\nBefore a trial, we trimmed plants so that they presented\none inflorescence with about eight flowers with fully de-\nhisced anthers. Before each butterfly trial, we both de-\nprived butterflies of nectar for at least 2 h and depleted\nnectar from potential recipient flowers by allowing 10 but-\nterflies to visit the wild-type plants, because butterflies\nseldom visited more than one flower with accumulated\nnectar per hour. After this preexposure, flowers retained\nmost of their pollen. To avoid disturbing pollen on flowers\nof the donor plant, we extracted their nectar with filter\npaper wicks. Unlike butterflies, bumblebees would not visit\ndepleted flowers consistently, so we used previously un-\nvisited donor and recipient plants for their trials. To ex-\namine the effects of pollen transport loss caused when bees\ngroom their bodies after removing abundant pollen from\nflowers (Harder 1990) on pollen dispersal characteristics,\nwe brushed anthers on all recipient plants for 13 of the\n46 trials involving bumblebees (see Thomson 1986).\nDuring each trial, an individual pollinator visited three\ntypes of plants in sequence. First, the pollinator had access\nto only wild-type plants to allow it to accumulate pollen\non its body. These plants were removed once the pollinator\nmoved to the single, transgenic donor plant. Similarly,\nwhile the pollinator subsequently visited flowers on recip-\nConsequences of Pollination Variation 385\nTable 1: Description of the eight models fit to the pollen dispersal data\nModel Free parameters Model description\nBinomial:\nB(\u0001) p\u00af1 Constant probability of deposition\nB(c) c, p\u00af1 Constant deposition plus possible noncontact\nB( )v , , l\u00af \u00afp p1 \u0002 Visit-dependent probability of deposition\nB( )v\u0003 c c, , , l\u00af \u00afp p1 \u0002 Noncontact and visit-dependent deposition\nBeta-binomial:\nBB(\u0001) , fp\u00af1 Variable, visit-independent probability of deposition\nBB(c) c, , fp\u00af1 Variable deposition plus possible noncontact\nBB( )v , , l, f\u00af \u00afp p1 \u0002 Variable and visit-dependent probability of deposition\nBB( )v\u0003 c c, , , l, f\u00af \u00afp p1 \u0002 Noncontact and variable, visit-dependent deposition\nient plants, we removed the donor plant. To limit the\npollinator from revisiting flowers, we replaced visited\nplants with unvisited plants while the insect was on a\ndistant plant in the array. Trials usually ended when the\npollinator ceased foraging (bee returned to nest, butterfly\nalighted for a protracted period). We videotaped each trial\nto record the visit sequence. Each butterfly was used for\na single trial, whereas five bees were used twice among the\n21 dispersal trials reported here.\nPollen dispersal was quantified by counting stained do-\nnor pollen grains on the stigmas of each visited flower.\nWe excised a flower\u2019s stigma with the distal 2 mm of style\nand mounted it upright on water agar in the well of a\ntissue culture plate. After covering the plate, we left the\nstigmas at room temperature for 2 h to allow pollen to\ngerminate and pollen tubes to anchor grains to the stigma.\nWe then added 0.5 mL of fresh reagent containing the b-\nd-glucuronide substrate to each well, covering the stigma\ncompletely, and incubated the stigmas at 37\u0002C for 50 min,\nby which time blue color had developed fully in transgenic\ngrains. We counted the transgenic and wild-type pollen\ngrains on each mounted stigma using a dissecting micro-\nscope. We also digitally photographed stigmas that had\nreceived many donor pollen grains so that they could be\nrecounted later.\nModels of Pollen Dispersal\nOur theoretical and statistical analyses consider the fol-\nlowing model, or variants of it (see table 1), that follow\nthe R pollen grains carried away from a specific donor\nflower by a single pollinator as it subsequently visits a\nsequence of recipient flowers. Suppose that while moving\nbetween flowers, both donor and nondonor pollen grains\nbecome unavailable for transfer to stigmas with probability\nu because they actively or passively fall off the pollinator\nor are moved to sites on the pollinator that do not contact\nstigmas. Also, suppose that while visiting a flower, each\nremaining pollen grain on the pollinator is deposited on\nthe stigma with probability t. If the probabilities of loss\nand deposition are constant among flower visits, then the\npollinator will carry an average of vR p R(1\u0001 u) (1\u0001v\ndonor pollen grains immediately before visiting thev\u00011t)\nth recipient beyond the donor. If pollen grains move in-v\ndependently of each other, then both loss and deposition\nare binomial processes.

A more\npractical approach recognizes that these biological pro-\ncesses generate specific probability density distributions for\nthe probabilities that govern the binomial processes of\npollen loss and deposition. The beta distribution is well\nsuited to this purpose. For example, according to this dis-\ntribution, the probability of pollen grains being transferred\nfrom a pollinator to a stigma during visit , , is distributedv tv\nas\nG(a\u0003 b)\na\u00011 b\u00011\u00afbeta(t Ft , f )p t (1\u0001 t ) , (3)tv v v v\nG(a)G(b)\nwhere is the average transfer probability, is thet\u00af G(x)v\ncomplete gamma function (see appendix), ,\u00afap t \/ftv\n, and is a positive parameter that char-\u00afbp (1\u0001 t )\/f ft tv\nacterizes the variance of , such that \u00aft Var [t ]p t (1\u0001v v v\n.

Figure 2A clarifies that as\nincreases, deposition of zero pollen grains on a givenft\nrecipient stigma becomes increasingly probable, even if the\npollinator carries many pollen grains. Pollen loss between\nflower visits can be modeled similarly.\nObservations of pollen dispersal by individual pollina-\ntors often include stigmas from visited flowers that receive\nno donor pollen, even though stigmas of subsequently\nvisited flowers receive many. Such null visits could arise\neither because the pollinator does not contact the stigma\nwhile visiting a flower or because contact occurred but\ndid not result in pollen transfer. To account for these two\npossibilities, we also considered zero-inflated models\n(Martin et al. 2005) that included a probability c of no\nstigma contact, so that the probability of pollen grainsdv\nbeing deposited on the stigma of the th flower visitedv\nafter the donor is\n\u00afPr (d FR , c, t , f )ptv v v\n\u00afc\u0003 (1\u0001 c)betabin(d FR , t , f ) if d p 0tv v v v .

Models with\nwere initially selected, and to avoid selecting overlyD ! 6\ncomplex models, we then excluded models that were more\ncomplex versions of the best AIC model (i.e., the model\nassociated with ; Richards 2008). Thus, a model wasDp 0\nselected only if each of its free parameters increased the\nmaximum log likelihood by at least 1.\nTwo requirements of model fitting caused us to use only\na subset of the dispersal trials for parameter estimation.\nEstimates will be biased for data from a visitation sequence\nthat did not include enough recipients to deplete the donor\npollen carried by the pollinator. To reduce this bias, we\nchose only dispersal sequences for which at least 20 donor\ngrains were dispersed to recipient stigmas and 95% of the\ndispersed donor pollen was deposited in the first 75% of\nrecipient flowers. In addition, deposition sequences in-\nvolving revisits to recipient flowers complicate parameter\nestimation, because the number of donor pollen grains\ntransferred to a stigma during its first visit and subsequent\nrevisit(s) are unknown, and our models require knowledge\nof the number of grains remaining to be deposited im-\nmediately before each visit (eq. [6]). As a result, we con-\nsidered dispersal sequences with revisits only if the most\nlikely situation was that all donor pollen was transferred\nduring the first visit to the revisited recipient flower and\nother possible combinations of pollen transfer to the\nstigma neither affected which model was selected nor\nstrongly influenced parameter estimates. Pollen sequences\nfor 21 Bombus melanopygus (including six trials using re-\ncipients with brushed anthers) and 13 Pieris rapae trials\nsatisfied all these criteria.\nWe performed subsequent AIC analyses to test for dif-\nferences in dispersal characteristics between pollinator spe-\ncies and among individuals of the same species and to\nassess whether pollen dispersal by bumblebees was affected\nby the brushing of anthers on recipient plants. To simplify\nthe analysis, we considered only individual trials for which\nmodel BB(\u0001) was selected in the initial AIC analysis (i.e.,\n12 of 13 butterfly runs and 18 of 21 bumblebee runs; see\ntable 2, row 5). Models were constructed by assuming that\neach pollinator dispersed pollen according to BB(\u0001), and\nwe compared seven models that differed in their assump-\ntions regarding whether and f differed between bees andp\u00af\nbutterflies, whether anther brushing affected and f, andp\u00af\nwhether the and f varied among individuals of the samep\u00af\npollinator type or could be better characterized by assum-\ning they were drawn from probability distributions (table\n3).

Hence, the ratio of pollen lost be-0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16\ntween flower visits to pollen transferred to stigmas ranged\nfrom 0 to 4. Scenarios also differed in the degree of over-\ndispersion, with equal overdispersion parameters for pol-\nlen transfer and loss (i.e., ). Three overdis-f p f p ft u\npersion scenarios were investigated ( ),fp 0.01, 0.1, 0.5\nwhich depicted pollen transfer and loss ranging from being\nan approximately binomial processes to being highly var-\niable from one flower visit to the next (see fig. 2A). For\nsimplicity, we assumed that pollinators always contacted\nthe stigma during a flower visit (i.e., ). The numberscp 0\nof pollen grains transferred to each stigma and lost be-\ntween flower visits were randomly drawn according to\nequation (4). In all cases, pollinators were simulated to\nvisit 250 flowers to ensure that all R grains had been de-\nposited.

Considering\njust the GUS pollen deposited on the first flower in the\nsequence of flowers visited by pollinators after they left\nthe transgenic plant, individual bumblebees dispersed al-\nmost 10-fold more pollen (mean p 126.2 pollen grains,\nvariance p16,151 grains2, lower 95% confidence limit\n[LCL] p 96.3, upper confidence limit [UCL] p 169.8;\nfig. 3B) than butterflies (meanp 15.1 grains, variancep\n1,052 grains2, LCL p 7.7, UCL p 35.8; fig. 3A). If these\ndistributions resulted from a Poisson process, the variance\nshould have equaled the mean, which is clearly not the\ncase. Instead, both samples are consistent with negative\nbinomial distributions (randomization test; butterflies,\n; bees, ), indicating much greater variationPp .45 Pp .43\nthan expected for a Poisson process. Overdispersion could\nhave arisen because pollinators picked up differing num-\nbers of pollen grains, grains did not disperse independently\nof each other, and\/or individual butterflies and bees had\ndifferent dispersal characteristics.\nSequences of dispersal of transgenic pollen by individual\npollinators also varied extensively around a generally de-\nclining trend (fig. 3C, 3D). Features of variation of par-\nticular interest include (1) considerable variation in de-\nposition during visits to initial recipients, when pollinators\ncarry the most donor pollen; (2) sporadic null visits, even\nrelatively early in dispersal sequences; and (3) occasional\npeaks of deposition late in sequences, when pollinators\ncarried relatively little donor pollen.

This result reveals that the prob-\nability of deposition varied extensively among flower visits\nfor individuals of both pollinator species (fig. 3E, 3F), in\ncontrast to the expectations for a binomial process. The\nbeta-binomial distribution allows for a high incidence of\nnull visits, especially with large f (e.g., fig. 2A), so it is\nnot surprising that explicit allowance for noncontact be-\ntween pollinators and stigmas seldom fit the data better\nthan beta-binomial models (table 2).\nFor both bumblebees and butterflies, model BB(\u0001) was\nselected most often (table 2), indicating that the mean\nprobability of pollen deposition onto stigmas varied in-\ndependently of the number of flowers visited since donor\nConsequences of Pollination Variation 391\nFigure 3: Examples of sources of variation in the dispersal of Brassica napus pollen.

Despite numerical differences in the es-\ntimates of and f within butterflies and bumblebees withp\u00af\nand without brushed anthers (fig. 5A), the interindividual\nvariation was consistent with sampling error (i.e., the data\nare explained well by very low and ). Both pollinator2d jp\u00af f\ntypes had similar , but all butterflies had larger f thanp\u00af\nthe bumblebees (fig. 5A). Consequently, differences be-\ntween butterflies and bumblebees in dispersal character-\nistics per pollen grain arise almost entirely from the greater\ndispersal variance of butterflies. Among trials for bum-\nblebees, those involving recipient flowers with brushed\nanthers had slightly reduced and significantly smaller fp\u00af\nthan those with intact recipient flowers (compare confi-\ndence intervals in fig. 5A), so again the main difference\namong classes of trials involved dispersal variance, rather\nthan the average dispersal pattern. Beta distributions cor-\nresponding to the maximum-likelihood parameter esti-\nmates for these three groups of trials (fig. 5B) illustrate\nthe much greater among-flower variation in deposition\nprobability for butterflies than for either type of trials with\nbumblebees.\nSimulation of the Effects of Pollen Loss\non Parameter Estimates\nThe fits of simulated data generated by model BB(\u0001) re-\nvealed that the mean probability of deposition per flower\nfor pollen that will eventually reach stigmas, , dependsp\u00af\non the mean probabilities that a pollen grain on a polli-\nnator is deposited on a stigma, , or lost during transitt\u00af\nbetween flowers, (fig. 6A).

Similarly,\nin the absence of pollen loss, the maximum likelihood\nestimate of the overdispersion parameter f was an un-\nbiased estimator of (fig. 6B). The estimated f increasedft\nlinearly with the probability of pollen loss, , and the rateu\u00af\nof increase was proportional to the overdispersion of sim-\nulated pollen loss and deposition. In summary, fitted val-\nues for both and f characterize combined effects ofp\u00af\npollen transfer and pollen loss. Consequently, estimates of\nthese parameters need to be interpreted in terms of the\njoint effects of both processes rather than with respect to\ndeposition alone (also see Morris et al. 1994; Rademaker\net al. 1997). Developing pollen dispersal experiments that\nwould allow these two loss processes to be estimated in-\ndependently remains a challenge because it requires esti-\nmating the pollen load on the pollinator before and after\nflower visitation.\nEffects of Pollination Variation on Mating Success\nOur model of pollen dispersal and mating revealed strong\nnegative effects of variation on mean seed production per\nflower (fig. 7). For the examples depicted in figure 7, we\n394 The American Naturalist\nassumed parameter values describing pollen transfer and\nloss that were consistent with our bumblebee fits (for de-\ntails, see legend of fig. 7), which resulted in an average of\n34.7 pollen grains being deposited on a stigma per flower\nvisit. Figure 7A depicts cases in which ovaries contain 50\nseeds, so flowers experiencing one pollinator visit suffered\npollen limitation in part because of insufficient average\npollen import, whereas for flowers visited more than once,\nthe average pollen limitation resulted solely from the con-\nsequences of Jensen\u2019s inequality for variation in pollen\nimport. In these examples, binomial variation in pollen\ndeposition ( ) reduced mean seed production veryf \u2248 0\nlittle because most flowers that were visited more than\nonce received sufficient pollen for complete ovule fertili-\nzation. However, as the magnitude of between-flower var-\niation in increased so that f was in the range observedp\u00af\nfor bumblebees ( to 0.4 and to 0.15; see\u00affp 0.1 pp 0.1\nfig. 5A), mean seed production fell by up to 80% of ca-\npacity. Reductions in seed set were most dramatic when\nflowers were visited infrequently. However, even when\nmean pollen deposition per flower exceeded ovule number\nby 100% ( visits, ), seed production was\u00afvp 3 d \/Op 23\nreduced by more than 40%. The much greater overdis-\npersion observed for butterflies (fig. 5A) would further\naggravate this depression in average reproductive success.\nNot surprisingly, variance limitation was less severe for a\ngiven f if flowers contained few ovules (fig. 7B) than if\nthey contained many ovules (fig. 7B). However, even with\nuniovulate flowers, variance limitation caused a 15% av-\nerage reduction in average seed production for values of\nf in the range observed for bee pollination, because a\nlarge fraction of flowers received no pollen during single\npollinator visits (fig. 2A, dark gray distribution).\nThis model also revealed two additional aspects of the\nrole of dispersal variance in mating success. Although the\nvariance in pollen deposition on stigmas, , affected meanft\nfertilization success, variance in transport loss, , did not,fu\nsince virtually identical results were obtained when we set\nrather than (not shown). In addition, ovulef \u2248 0 f p fu u t\nnumber and average pollen receipt did not have interacting\neffects on seed production, so average seed set varied pos-\nitively with the ratio of expected pollen import to ovule\nnumber, . For example, for a given , when average\u00afO\/d ftv\npollen receipt was twice the number of ovules in the as-\nsociated ovary, the expected fraction of ovules fertilized\nwas relatively insensitive to ovary size, O.\nDiscussion\nAnimal pollination generates extensive variation in pollen\ndispersal (e.g., fig. 3), which should severely reduce average\nreproductive performance in plant populations (fig. 7).\nGiven this potential impact, the causes of dispersal vari-\nance become topics of interest because they could depend\non ecological circumstances and govern the opportunity\nfor selection on reproductive traits. Interestingly, not all\nof the three potential sources of dispersal variance that we\nassessed contributed strongly to variation in the deposition\nof Brassica napus pollen. On the one hand, differences\nbetween pollinator types (e.g., nonoverlapping ranges of\nf for butterflies and bumblebees in fig. 5A) and among\nvisits by individual pollinators (e.g., dominance of beta-\nbinomial models as explanations of the data; table 2) both\nrepresent major components of dispersal variance. These\ndifferences exist even though the mean probability of ul-\ntimately dispersed pollen being deposited on a stigma per\nflower visit, , was about 0.12 for both pollinator typesp\u00af\n(fig. 5A). On the other hand, we found no evidence that\ndifferences among individuals of the same pollinator type\ncontribute significantly to dispersal variance (table 3). In\naddition, our results provide little evidence that butterflies\nand bumblebees visiting B. napus failed to contact stigmas\nwith sufficient frequency to be distinguished from the rel-\natively high frequency of null visits expected with stigma\ncontact for values of f in the range observed for bees and,\nespecially, butterflies (fig. 2A, dark gray distribution).\nOur findings for bumblebees are consistent with those\nof Cresswell (1999), who measured pollen import during\nsingle visits by Bombus lapidarius workers to B. napus flow-\ners with intact or brushed anthers. Cresswell did not track\nmarked pollen from a specific donor, so his data for flowers\nwith brushed anthers (which could receive only outcross\npollen) are most comparable to our results for the first\nflower that bees visited after leaving donor plants. Cres-\nswell\u2019s mean of 141 pollen grains for flowers with brushed\nanthers falls well within the confidence interval for our\nmean of 126 grains, indicating equivalent pollen dispersal.\nIn addition, the variance : mean ratio for Cresswell\u2019s data\nwas 36, indicating much more variation than expected\nfrom a Poisson distribution, and it is consistent with the\nnegative binomial distribution that characterized our\nbumblebee data.\nOur results are largely inconsistent with a strong sys-\ntematic decline in the mean probability of deposition of\ndonor pollen as pollinators move away from donor plants.\nThis conclusion differs from that of some previous studies\n(e.g., Morris et al. 1994; Harder and Barrett 1996), which\ncould occur because dispersal of B. napus pollen differs\nfrom dispersal for other species and\/or the application of\ndifferent statistical methods led to contrasting conclusions.\nThese alternatives cannot be distinguished without ana-\nlyzing data for various species with our methods; however,\nseveral aspects of the effect of dispersal variance on model\nfitting raise the possibility that this contrast has a statistical\nbasis. Therefore, before considering the biological impli-\ncations of our results, we address the importance of ac-\nConsequences of Pollination Variation 395\ncounting correctly for variance during statistical analysis\nof pollen dispersal.\nConsiderations for Fitting Pollen Dispersal Models\nFitting nonlinear, process-based models requires both the\nformulation of models that characterize relevant biological\nmechanisms and the inclusion of the appropriate sampling\ndistribution to represent the mean, variance, and higher\nmoments adequately as well as their interdependence, if\nany (Bolker 2008). Mechanistic models of expected pollen\ndispersal from individual donor plants have been the sub-\nject of considerable discussion (e.g., Bateman 1947; Lertz-\nman and Gass 1983; Morris et al. 1995; Rademaker et al.\n1997; Harder and Wilson 1998), but the nature of variation\naround the expectation has not been considered. Fur-\nthermore, although the proposed mechanistic models are\nconceptually useful, some include parameters that cannot\nbe estimated with confidence with only counts of pollen\nloads on stigmas (e.g., Harder and Wilson\u2019s [1998] models\nof the effects of pollinator grooming and layering on pol-\nlinators\u2019 bodies). This problem required us to develop the\nset of more phenomenological models considered in this\narticle (see also Morris et al. 1994) and to use simulation\nto assess the likely effects on model fitting of processes\nthat could not be measured directly (e.g., transport loss).\nThe most common method of fitting dispersal data uses\nstandard linear regression techniques after log transfor-\nmation of the stigmatic pollen counts to fit Bateman\u2019s\nmodel (eq. [1]) or its exponential equivalent (e.g., Waser\nand Price 1984; Thomson 1986; Rademaker et al. 1997).\nThis approach assumes a lognormal distribution of de-\nposition around the mean for each recipient position. In\ncontrast, the example distributions in fig. 3A and B are\ninconsistent with a lognormal distribution, because receipt\nof no pollen is the most common outcome and the var-\niance is too large, so that log transformation (or any mono-\ntonic transformation) would not produce the normal error\ndistribution required by standard regression analysis. Al-\nternatively, data from separate trials could be averaged for\neach recipient position, which, according to the central\nlimit theorem, should result in a normal distribution of\nmeans for a reasonable number of trials (e.g., Harder and\nBarrett 1996); however, averaging can lead to the impres-\nsion that the deposition fraction declines systematically\nwith recipient position, even though it is constant for in-\ndividual trials (Harder and Wilson 1998). Furthermore,\nthe variance arises from the processes responsible for the\ndispersal pattern, so that analysis of averages ignores as-\npects of the data that might be informative. Therefore,\nanalysis of pollen dispersal should use individual rather\nthan averaged observations and incorporate the distri-\nbution that reflects the nature of the observations, which\nwill usually require the application of techniques other\nthan regression based on the normal distribution.\nPollen counts on stigmas are nonnegative integers, so\nonly discrete distributions are formally appropriate. We\nmodeled pollen deposition as though the number of (ul-\ntimately dispersed) pollen grains on the pollinator awaiting\ndeposition was known (known total approach), in which\ncase the binomial or beta-binomial distributions are rea-\nsonable options, depending on the observed variance. Al-\nternatively, deposition could be modeled as though the\nnumber of pollen grains awaiting deposition is unknown\n(unknown total approach), in which case the Poisson or\nnegative binomial distributions are appropriate (e.g., Mor-\nris et al. 1994), again depending on the variance (see \u201cDis-\ntribution of Pollen Deposition\u201d). We compared known\ntotal and unknown total approaches (results not shown)\nand found the former to be much superior, on the basis\nof AIC, because it uses available information about the\nnumber of pollen grains that will eventually be dispersed\nbefore each visit to a recipient flower. Regardless of which\napproach is used, choosing a sampling distribution that\ncorrectly characterizes the magnitude of variation is im-\nportant, because an incorrect choice can lead to selection\nof an incorrect model for the average dispersal pattern.\nFor example, if we ignore the overdispersion of the de-\nposition data compared with a binomial distribution and\nperform AIC analysis considering only binomial models\nB(\u0001), B(c), B( ) and B( ), then the most complexv c\u0003 v\nmodel, B( ), is selected exclusively for eight 8 of thec\u0003 v\n13 butterfly trials, and model B(\u0001) is not selected for any\ntrial. This mistake arises when overdispersion is ignored\nbecause overly complex models allow more flexibility in\nthe mean to accommodate small or large observations\n(including frequent null visits) that are too extreme to be\nconsistent with typical variation for the assumed variance\nmodel (for general discussion of this problem, see Richards\n2008). Similar biased selection of overly complex models\nmay also have contributed to Morris et al.\u2019s (1994) report\nof declining deposition fractions, if negative binomial dis-\ntributions (e.g., fig. 3A, 3B) were more appropriate than\nthe Poisson distributions that they considered.\nConsequences of Variation in Pollen Dispersal\nNonlinear conversion of pollen receipt into seed produc-\ntion and variation in pollen dispersal may combine to limit\nseed production. This limit may occur even when flowers\nreceive sufficient pollen to fertilize all ovules if it had been\ndistributed more evenly among flowers (fig. 7). In our\nmating model, all pollen grains on stigmas fertilized ovules\nwhen total pollen receipt (i) was less than or equal to\novule availability (O), so that the probability that at least\none ovule in an ovary is not fertilized equals the cumu-\n396 The American Naturalist\nlative probability that grains were deposited,i ! O Fp\n. When the expected number of fertilizations was\nO\u00011\u0002 d (i)vip0\ngreater than the number of ovules ( ) and pollend\u00af 1 Ov\ndeposition exhibited binomial variation, this cumulative\nprobability was always effectively 0, because average pollen\nimport greatly exceeded ovule number and realized import\nvaried relatively little (see fig. 2B), so that variance limi-\ntation did not occur (left edge of fig. 7A when ). Inv 1 1\ncontrast, the greater variance of beta-binomial distribu-\ntions increased the chance that for the same averagei ! O\npollen import, increasing the probability of variance lim-\nitation (remainder of fig. 7A). Ovule limitation varies pos-\nitively with ovule number; however, variance limitation is\nevident even for uniovulate flowers for f less than that\nobserved for pollination by bumblebees and butterflies\n(fig. 7B). Thus, variance limitation probably occurs com-\nmonly and so acts as a pervasive influence on reproductive\nperformance in plant populations and floral evolution.\nThe general consequences of variance limitation differ\nbetween female and male function. From the female per-\nspective, variance limitation would decline or be elimi-\nnated if individual flowers received multiple visits (fig. 7A).\nIn contrast, multiple visits cannot mitigate the conse-\nquences of variance limitation for male success, because\nsiring opportunities lost when a donor contributes pollen\nto stigmas that receive more pollen than needed to fertilize\nall ovules cannot be shifted to stigmas that receive too few\ngrains for complete fertilization. Thus, for ecological per-\nformance, which depends primarily on seed production,\nvariance limitation will be most important when flowers\ntypically receive few pollinator visits and so could aggra-\nvate pollen limitation. From an evolutionary perspective,\neffects of variance limitation on female function should\narise in populations with limited pollinator service,\nwhereas its evolutionary effects on male function should\noccur more generally. Such asymmetric relations between\nthe sex roles are the essential aspect of Bateman\u2019s (1948)\nprinciple that drives sexual selection.\nVariance limitation could select for three types of char-\nacteristics: floral traits that increase pollinator visitation,\nreduce dispersal variance, or reduce the nonlinearities in\npostpollination processes that cause Jensen\u2019s inequality.\nTraits that could reduce dispersal variance include polli-\nnator specialization and\/or floral mechanisms that en-\nhance the precision of interactions between pollinators and\nfloral sex organs. Dispersal variance caused by a diverse\nfauna of pollinators that differ in the variance they create\nshould promote specialization for pollination by the low-\nvariance pollinators. For example, our empirical results\nindicate that butterflies are high-variance pollinators of B.\nnapus (fig. 5A), so that in B. napus populations served by\nboth butterflies and bumblebees, selection should favor\nspecialization on bee pollination. In contrast to Stebbins\u2019\n(1970) hypothesis that selection favors specialization on\nthe most effective pollinator (i.e., that providing the high-\nest average pollination), specialization could evolve in re-\nsponse to differences in the variance in dispersal among\npollinators, even if the low-variance type provided some-\nwhat lower average pollen dispersal. The variance-reducing\nadvantages of increased pollinator attraction arise largely\nfrom the considerations outlined in the preceding para-\ngraph, which emphasized that such advantages arise pri-\nmarily through female function when seed production is\nsusceptible to variance limitation. In contrast, selection\nfavoring precise pollinator-flower interactions could act\nthrough both sex roles. Such selection should lead to the\norigin and refinement of traits such as zygomorphy, con-\ncealed nectar, buzz pollination, heterostyly, and enantio-\nstyly. Furthermore, selection for precise pollinator-flower\ninteractions may commonly accompany pollinator spe-\ncialization (see Muchhala 2007), synergistically reducing\ntwo components of dispersal variance. Strangely, although\nselection for precision has long been recognized as a re-\ncurring theme in angiosperm evolution (see Neal et al.\n1998) and precision specifically denotes \u201clow variance,\u201d\nvariation in pollen export and import has seldom been a\ntopic of explicit interest (although see Waser and Price\n1984).\nThe second class of adaptations that reduce Jensen\u2019s\ninequality affect the postpollination processes that cause\nnonlinear conversion of pollen dispersal into fitness. In\ncontrast to variance reduction adaptations, most of the\ncauses of diminishing returns after pollination involve fe-\nmale traits, including limited stigma capacity for pollen\nreceipt, limited style capacity for transmission of pollen\ntubes, and limited ovule number. For example, Burd\n(1995) demonstrated theoretically that stochastic polli-\nnation may affect the evolution of production of \u201cexcess\u201d\novules as a bet-hedging strategy to take advantage of oc-\ncasional receipt of many pollen grains. In contrast, we\nfound that greater ovule numbers generally aggravated var-\niance limitation of seed production (compare curves in\nfig. 7B for a given f), although our model did not in-\ncorporate the allocation trade-offs between ovule and\nflower size and number that Burd considered. Regardless,\nthis example emphasizes that selection on sex allocation\nmay interact with selection on floral traits that influence\ndispersal variance, again revealing the importance of con-\nsidering variance during pollen dispersal.\nFrom both female and male perspectives, pollen grains\non stigmas do not represent reproductive success; instead,\nthey are means to that end. Because pollination is a high-\nvariance process (e.g., figs. 3A, 3B, 5A) and postpollination\nprocesses typically impose nonlinear conversion of pollen\ngrains on stigmas into genetic contributions to seeds (e.g.,\nfig. 1), Jensen\u2019s inequality must commonly reduce average\nConsequences of Pollination Variation 397\nreproductive success below that expected from average\npollen dispersal. Given the likely ecological and evolu-\ntionary implications of this effect outlined above, dispersal\nvariance cannot be considered simply noise that is an in-\nevitable consequence of relying on pollen vectors that are\ndisinterested in promoting plant reproduction. Instead,\ndispersal variance is a characteristic of pollination with\nunique consequences and so deserves to be recognized\nas a pervasive and significant factor in angiosperm\nreproduction.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank L.
