Small water bodies \nform in the resulting hollows and are used for fisheries, livestock management, irrigation, \nbathing and washing clothes. Despite their importance to everyday life, there is no up-to-\ndate inventory or monitoring.

It concludes that there has been an expansion in their numbers but no \nsystematic planning of their use.   \n \nKeywords:  Bangladesh; small water bodies; fish farming; remote sensing; GIS; mixed \nmethods \n  \n3 \nSmall  Water  Bodies in Bangladesh \n \nIntroduction \n \nWhat image does water conjure up for you in the context of Bangladesh?  Most people \nwould probably say floods and social dislocation, some might refer to the \nextraordinarily dynamic hydro-geomorphological systems, and a few would no doubt \nraise the issue of the future havoc that may be wrought in low-lying coastal areas by \nrising sea-levels.  Far less prominent in the popular consciousness of the global North is \nany thought of water shortages in Bangladesh or her need to manage scarce water \nresources; yet consideration of these issues is crucial to the long-term success of the \ngovernment\u2019s National Water Management Plan (approved in March 2004).  Even the \nwaters of the Ganges are no longer guaranteed to be a limitless source of raw material \nfor irrigation and industrial processes.  India\u2019s inauguration in 1975 of the Farakka \nBarrage only 18 km upstream of the border has substantially reduced dry season flow, \ncausing a level of hardship that the Bangladesh-India Treaty on Sharing of the Ganges \nWaters signed in 1996 has failed to mitigate (Brichieri-Colombi and Bradnock 2003).  \nAs a result, water has become an issue of geopolitical importance between these riparian \nneighbours. \nWater quality is another practical and policy issue in Bangladesh.  Water-borne \ndiseases are a common source of morbidity and a substantial portion of the high rate of \ninfant mortality is thought to be water-related (WHO 2000).  The use of oral rehydration \ntherapy has been a help with the latter problem but the need for clean water supplies of \nbetter bacteriological quality has been acknowledged for three decades or more.  In \n1972 the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund decided to invest in drilling for cleaner \ngroundwater and their initiative has since been taken up privately by millions of \nfamilies around the country (Smith et al. 2000).  There are now 12 million or more \ntubewells in Bangladesh tapping aquifers in the Quaternary sediments composing the \ndelta.  This groundwater source represents about 80 per cent of drinking water \nnationwide (Ahmed 2002).   \nSince the water now available is of a better bacteriological quality than ever \nbefore, one might be forgiven for thinking that the problem is solved.  However, in 1995 \nit was announced that this new, underground source is extensively contaminated with a \nlife-threatening toxin \u2013 arsenic.  Extensive screening of tubewells has shown that 27 per \ncent are poisoned and unsafe for drinking purposes at the government\u2019s declared \n  \n4 \nthreshold of 0.05 mg of arsenic per litre (BGS and DPHE 2001; Atkins et al. 2007).  As \na result, a debate has begun about a possible reversion to the use of surface waters if \nthese can be managed in such a way as to minimize the bacteriological load.  Some \ncommentators are sceptical and instead prefer measures that include the chemical \nremoval of arsenic from groundwater, but others insist that properly sealed dug wells \nare suitable (Smith et al. 2003).  Another option might be the use of the many ponds, \nlakes and other surface water bodies that are abundant in Bangladesh (Kr\u00e4nzlin 2000).  \nIt is these water bodies that concern us here. \nOne of the problems in the debate about supplies from water bodies in rural \nareas has been a lack of information.  We actually know very little, especially for small \nwater bodies (SWBs), about the traditional patterns of usage and management that were \nin place before the 1970s or 1980s, and their potential for the future.  Our fieldwork was \ntherefore in essence a detailed exploration of SWBs in a typical region, Shahjadpur \nthana, in the floodplain of the River Jamuna (Brahmaputra) (Figure 1).  Within that we \nselected four mouzas, the lowest administrative unit, and looked at all their 287 SWBs \n(Huda 2004; Huda and Atkins 2005).  In addition to fieldwork in all of the local \nvillages, the research had a laboratory-based element that involved the analysis of maps, \naerial photographs and satellite images.  This paper will describe the methods used and \nthe results achieved.  First, after a brief introduction to Shahjadpur thana, we describe \nthe range of SWBs found in the study area and their use by local people.  Next, we look \nat their change through time, employing a number of source materials.  The objective \nhere is to understand the place of SWBs in the shifting patterns of water use in rural \nBangladesh.  Finally, we reflect upon the mixed methods used in this research and their \npotential for replication in other parts of the country, and possibly further afield.  \nAlthough it is not possible for the present paper to pursue this point in depth, it is \npossible that SWBs could play an increasingly important role in the sustainable use of \nnatural resources in Bangladesh and that a combination of remote sensing and \nqualitative survey techniques could add a great deal to resource management through \nunderstanding popular perceptions and uses of surface water bodies.   \n< Figure 1 here > \n \nShahjadpur thana \n \nShahjadpur thana, in Sirajganj district, is located on the western bank of the Jamuna just \nnorth of its confluence with the Padma (Ganges).  This is a poor, rural area, densely \n  \n5 \npopulated at 1,296 people per sq. km in 1991 and reliant upon agriculture.  The average \nliteracy rate is 31 per cent for males, but a meagre 18 per cent for females (BBS 1996). \nOnly 13 per cent of households have an electricity connection and other physical \ninfrastructure is weakly developed.  For instance, Narayandaha, one of our study \nmouzas, although less than a kilometre from the centre of Shahjadpur town, has no \ndirect road access.  This may be explained by its ghetto status, first as a home for \nHindus, and more recently for the minority Shia muslim community.  Daya mouza is \nequally close to the paurashava (municipality) but has, in contrast, benefited from its \ngrowth, more than doubling in population from 163 in 1972 to 395 in 2002.  Paschim \nKharua mouza has also expanded rapidly, as a dairy farming area serving a cooperative \nfactory, Milk Vita, and our fourth mouza, Baoikhola, specializes in high yielding \nvarieties of rice, cultivated in the early kharif (April-July) and rabi (dry) seasons using \nirrigation from its large beel.  Baoikhola is the only one of our study areas to have none \nof the modern conveniences of electricity, gas, land line telephones, sewers or piped \nwater.   \nRoughly 70 per cent of the thana is cultivated and the remainder is made up of \nhomesteads, roads, and permanent water bodies like rivers, khals\/jola and beels. Much \nof the land is inundated by rainfall and river water during the monsoon season; the \nextent of flooding is normally defined by topographic features within the flood plain. \nThe flooding of low-lying areas begins with pre-monsoon rainfall in May and June and \nreaches a peak with over-bank river discharge in July and August.   \nPeople in the region have long since abandoned the use of SWBs for drinking \nwater.  Instead this comes almost wholly from tubewells, with SWBs now being used \nfor irrigation and fisheries, along with household uses such as water for cooking, \nbathing, and the washing of clothes and utensils.  In addition, they are important in the \nraising of livestock, and for the common kachuripana or water-hyacinth (Eichhornia \ncrassipes) that grows profusely and is used as a green manure, cattle fodder, and a \npacking material (for instance to stop spillages from full milk vessels on their way to \nmarket).  SWBs are also associated with a wide diversity of useful plants through the \nuse of their water in the irrigation of house gardens. Wealthier families grow tree fruit \nand the poor concentrate on vegetable crops like bottle gourd and beans, which during \nlean periods supplement their staple foods (Stokoe 2000; Wallace et al. 1987).  The \nSWB use of greatest concern is as cess pools. In 2002 in Daya and Paschim Kharua, for \ninstance, over 90 per cent of households used kacha latrines, small huts with thatched \n  \n6 \nwalls from which the effluent drained directly to a SWB.  Our survey showed that there \nwere some people bathing in and eating fish from these polluted water bodies. \nMost of our key informants suggested the need of a proper inventory of all the \nSWBs for the identification of issues. They also expressed concern regarding the khas \nSWBs, which are state-owned but often leased to influential people or just occupied \nillegally. There is a customary expectation that the poor will benefit from khas \nresources, which are thought of as common property, but the enforcement of both \ntraditional and legal rights is weak. Our focus groups and participant observation raised \ndifferent points on SWB management for women and men.  Domestic benefits were \narticulated strongly by the women\u2019s groups, for instance the issue of drinking water, \nparticularly for those households who do not have direct access to a tube well or in \nareas, such as Paschim Kharua, where there are few alternative sources to SWBs.  In \naddition, they emphasised the washing of clothes, the drawing of water for cooking \npurposes, crockery washing and bathing.  Women were also concerned about the \nrelative scarcity of water in the dry season and of hygienic water during the monsoon.  \nIn contrast, the men mentioned the economic benefits of SWB use for agricultural and \nfishery production. The one point mentioned in common by both men and women was \nirrigation.   \nThe use of SWBs for fish farming has fluctuated over the last 30 years but \nremains high at 75 per cent.  Usually there is natural recharge during the annual floods \ndue to the migration of fingerlings. According to the Master Plan Organization (MPO \n1984), SWBs can be categorized according to the intensity of their fishery management:  \n(i) extensive: stocked with carp, no fertilization and feeding; (ii) semi-intensive: carp, \nmulti-species culture with fertilization but without feeding; (iii) semi-intensive: carp, \nmulti-species culture with fertilization and low quality feeding; (iv) super-intensive: \nstocked with carp or tilapia, multi-species culture, increased water use and aeration, \nheavy and regular fertilization and use of high quality feed. Almost all of the SWBs in \nthe study area fall into the first two categories. Of the five reasons suggested by Wood \n(1994) for a decline of stocks of fish, three are observable locally. First, there are few \ncommercial operators, with dominance by small, domestic operations. Second, \nmarketed fish are consumed mainly by wealthier groups and the economy is generally \none of use rather than exchange.  Third, co-ownership of SWBs is often mentioned as a \nconstraint, although there is a clear potential for cooperation between co-owning joint \nfamilies. \n \n  \n7 \nTypes of small water bodies  \n \nSeveral types of SWBs may be recognised in this part of Bangladesh (Figure 2).  First, \nthere is the human-made pit or ditch known as a \u2018doba\u2019 or \u2018pagar\u2019, which is \napproximately 25-400 sq. m in extent, like the vernal pools mapped in a similar exercise \nto ours by Lathrop et al. 2005.  Dobas retain water only in the wet season and then dry \nout.  Most are located close to homesteads, as is the larger \u2018pukur\u2019, which at 150-1,000 \nsq. m is a perennial water source and is often used for fish farming.  Both dobas and \npukurs are the result of the need to excavate earth to build house mounds up high \nenough to avoid floods.  Most houses on the flood plains of Bangladesh are elevated in \nthis way and there are therefore millions of excavated ponds. Second, a \u2018dighi\u2019 is a \nsmall tank or reservoir, of over 750 sq. m, and a \u2018jola\u2019 or \u2018khal\u2019 is a linear watercourse \nmade for transport or irrigation purposes and to provide means for excess water to drain \naway during floods.  Both of these are artificial but our third and final SWB, the \u2018beel\u2019, \n\u2018baor\u2019 or \u2018haor\u2019, is natural.  A beel is a saucer-shaped depression, often an ox-bow lake, \nfound in association with a river that has altered its course, a common phenomenon in \nthe ever-changing geomorphology of lowland Bangladesh.  This may be the result of \nriver meandering due to siltation, or the aggressive riverbank erosion that is often found \nalong this portion of the Jamuna.  Beels vary in size from 1,000 sq. m to several square \nkilometres and they are valuable resources for local people wanting water for irrigation \nor for aquaculture.   \n< Figure 2 here > \nIn 1982 the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, through the Non-Crops Statistics \nSection of its Agricultural Statistics Wing, estimated a total of 1.86 million SWBs, \nmostly managed ponds, through a field survey conducted in 420 thanas (sub-districts) \nout of 493 (BBS, 1984).  At the same time another survey was undertaken by the Space \nResearch and Remote Sensing Organization, using satellite imagery and aerial \nphotographs, at the request of the Bangladesh Fisheries Department (SPARRSO 1984). \nThis classified water bodies suitable for fish production as either \u2018small\u2019 or \u2018large\u2019. The \nSWBs included ponds and tanks with surface areas of less than 25 ha. Colour infrared \naerial photographs taken in 1983 and 1984 were used to identify and locate 122,000 \nponds in 40 selected thanas, covering an area of 13,900 ha. The total number of ponds \nin Bangladesh was then estimated by extrapolation to be 1.3 million, covering an area \nnationally of 164,000 ha. The survey showed the pond density to be 2 to 35 ponds per \nsq. km, with an average water area of 0.13-2.9 per cent. \n  \n8 \nThe Second Phase Agricultural Census Project (1985-90) carried out a survey of \nSWBs in 1989 to obtain a comparison with the earlier surveys, and had the objective for \nthe first time of establishing comprehensive statistics on inland fisheries resources. The \nresult was published in 1994, the estimated total number of ponds this time being 1.95 \nmillion (BBS 1994).  SWBs were also the focus of research carried out in the Tangail \narea by the Compartmentalization Pilot Project (CPP 1996) and for South Hatia Island \nin the Bay of Bengal (MES 1998). These studies found similar numbers in their areas as \nhad the BBS, and they pioneered a classification using the terms \u2018cultured\u2019, \u2018culturable\u2019 \nand \u2018derelict\u2019 ponds, finding 15 per cent in the last category. \nAlthough these studies are of interest for their estimates, it was not an objective \nof our study to provide similar scaled-up calculations of SWBs at the national level. In \nour view this would not have been helpful without comparative studies of a sample of \nthe various hydrological landscape regions of Bangladesh. \n  \nDetecting the changing numbers of small water bodies in Shahjadpur thana \n \nOur study was partly historically-oriented, using a number of sources to estimate the \nchanging number and use of SWBs.  We were particularly interested in the scope for \ncombining remote sensing with field techniques in order to maximize our knowledge of \nthe historical geography of SWBs over the thirty years since their change in use away \nfrom drinking water.  Our expectation was that this shifting use pattern might have \nreduced people\u2019s enthusiasm for excavating silt and renewing the dobas, pukurs and \ndighis after the annual floods, and therefore that the number might have diminished.   \nWe used multi-spectral and panchromatic satellite data with the highest available \nresolution and were fortunate to be able to access all of the available imagery for the \nstudy area and use it to evaluate change over the period 1972 to 2003. Previous studies \n(Vonders and Clevers 1999) had identified the need for high spatial resolution sensors \nin SWB detection and Table I shows that we were able to fulfil this requirement from \nthe earliest date. Such rich and detailed sources are unusual for work on Bangladesh but \nit was nevertheless important for us to prove an added value in interpretation.  It is \narguable that consistency and analytical depth might have been gained from the use of \njust one source, Landsat for instance, through time or that further triangulation might \nhave been possible from the use of several different sensors at key cross-sectional \nmoments, but limited resources and access meant that we were pleased with the data \navailable to us. \n  \n9 \nOur earliest source (1972) was declassified data from the American spy satellite \ncode-named CORONA. These came as filmstrips and were processed using a \nphotogrammetric optical scanner at 7.5 micron resolution, giving a very high quality of \nimage that is equivalent to a two metre ground resolution.  Since we were fortunate also \nto have access to black and white aerial photography for this period, our early baseline \nin the early 1970s was solid.  This was supplemented by optical satellite images of a \ngood radiometric and geometric quality from the well-known French satellite, SPOT, \nthe American Landsat, and the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) platforms.  Because these \nimages were captured at a series of dates from 1972 to 2003, we were able to engage in \nland-use change detection. Because optical sensors are restricted by cloud cover, a \nmajor problem for Bangladesh in the monsoon season, we also experimented with \nRADAR, which has the additional advantage of collecting data day and night and, at \nmicrowave frequencies, of penetrating the vegetation canopy.  The European Resource \nSatellite (ERS), Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-C), and X SAR (also Shuttle-based) were \nevaluated, although for technical reasons the results were disappointing. Other studies \nhave shown that the consistent tone and smooth texture of small inland water bodies are \noften well delineated by higher resolution RADAR sensors. We think that there may be \npotential here for future work with SWBs in Bangladesh. \nBefore outlining our methodology, it is worth noting that, to the best of our \nknowledge, no-one has previously performed a comparative assessment of the visibility \nof different types of water bodies on images of different spatial and spectral resolution. \n< Table I here > \nFirst, a visual analysis was performed using manual on-screen digitizing \nmethods for identification and mapping, and the images were digitally classified, using \nvarious methods, to identify the water bodies in the area. The classified images were \nthen verified using GIS data derived from mouza maps, which enabled the identification \nof land use features, plot boundaries, and the location and identification of individual \nSWBs.  Each plot thought to have an SWB present was then visited during the \nfieldwork to measure the spatial extent of that particular feature and to get an idea of the \nsurrounding land use. All of the SWBs were checked by a participatory fieldwork \ntechnique that involved showing the relevant CORONA image and aerial photographs \nto local people who, once they had orientated themselves with known landmarks, were \nvery helpful in providing commentaries on past changes and present uses.  Finally, GPS \ndata were used to ground truth the remotely sensed data, which were then geocorrected \nand registered to a base map using GIS software, and matched to the image using image \n  \n10 \nanalysis software (Figure 3). Rather than describe the full technical detail in this paper, \nwe will instead focus on the results from analyzing the best available images and from \nthe ground survey.  \n< Figure 3 here > \nThe first field survey (winter 2001\/2) of the four mouzas found 287 SWBs \n(Table II; Figure 4). The largest was measured at 34,812.8 sq. m using a hand-held GPS \nand, at the lowest end, the minimum doba size is about 40 sq. m. 20 SWBs were \nreported as dry during the field survey. The distribution pattern for the different class \nsizes follows more or less the pattern as observed for the whole study area; in other \nwords, there is no spatial concentration of large or small water bodies.   \n<Table II here> \n< Figure 4 here > \nAn important technical issue for the inventory of SWBs is the smallest size \nthreshold at which they can confidently be identified by remote sensing (Lathrop et al. \n2005).  This is important for future use of that technique wherever fieldwork is not \nfeasible; we therefore employed imagery with the best resolution in order to provide \nmeaningful results.  One problem with the preliminary assessment of the images was \noccasional confusion in the separate identification of vegetation in the house \ncompounds and the water of a SWB. It is common, for instance, for people to have \nmango, jackfruit, coconut, guava, papaya, banana and other fruit trees or bamboo stands \nthat overhang the water\u2019s edge.  Second, haze also significantly influences the spectral \nproperties of the image and affects the classification results. Third, the months from \nDecember to March are normally the middle stage of irrigated paddy cultivation and \nlow and medium-high lands are covered with paddy. These irrigated paddy fields add \nbig clusters of scattered water pixels to the croplands and, again, cause uncertainties of \nclassification. \nTable III summarises the results of the remote sensing interpretation in terms of \nthe smallest SWB that was detected, in square metres.\n1\n The reader will immediately \nnotice the inconsistency of the results. This is due to the different resolutions of the \nvarious sensors and their ability to distinguish SWBs from surrounding noise. The \nsmallest SWBs were detected by the IRS-ID for 1999 and 2003, although we must \nremember that SWBs are continually being created or re-excavated and the surrounding \nvegetation grows or is cut, and comparing sensors through time therefore has the \ndisadvantage that the set of targets is not stable. The other sensors detected larger SWBs \nsuch as beels and jolas but were less successful with dighis, dobas and pukurs. The \n  \n11 \nresolution of SPOT images has now improved (5 m Pan) and they will therefore become \nmore useful for this kind of study, not least because the unit price of a SPOT image is \nless than other high resolution equivalents.  \n< Table III here > \nTable III excludes synthetic aperture RADAR imagery: ERS-I 1993 and NASA \nSIR-C 1994. We found that these low resolution sensors cannot identify all of the types \nreliably. However, they may in future be helpful for understanding changes, especially \nthe larger water bodies above 1000 sq. m., and it is worth remembering that RADAR \ndata can be acquired during the day or night and through cloud.  \nFigure 5 uses a series of miniature histograms to depict the size range of each \ntype of SWB.  These sizes were determined by ground survey using a hand-held GPS \nand they are presented here on the horizontal axis in square metres on a logarithmic \nscale. The vertical bars represent the number of SWBs in each size category but we will \nnot delve further into that in the present paper, other than to point out the concentration \n(dobas and pukurs) at the lower end of the size range.  The small triangular symbols \nunder each histogram show the median size for each SWB type and provide a means of \nvisualising the observation data in Table IV.   \n< Figure 5 here > \n< Table IV here > \nThe integration of GIS, remote sensing and fieldwork was the basis of our \nresearch.  Our experience shows that the most successful visual interpretation requires \nfamiliarity with feature types on the ground and we were particularly fortunate to be \nable to draw upon our detailed prior knowledge of the field area. This is by no means \nalways possible for researchers.  Table IV is a summary of the results, showing a \ncomparison between estimates of the average size of SWBs derived from remote \nsensing platforms, and those gathered through two ground-based methodologies.  First, \nwe used questionnaires, focus groups and interviews with key informants to reconstruct \nthe changing number and size of SWBs through time.  To aid their deliberations, \ninformants were shown copies of satellite images to orientate themselves.  We were \nsurprised at how visually literate people were and, generally speaking, they had no \ndifficulty in identifying landmarks and in describing the SWBs under discussion.  The \nolder respondents in particular remember the details of past SWB excavation, extension \nand extinction as clearly as they do the construction of their houses. This is because \nthese water resources play a key part in their daily lives and are important features in the \nlocal landscape. Second, we walked the villages and fields, using a GPS to measure the \n  \n12 \nlocation and dimensions of present-day water features, and recording a range of \ncharacteristics such as depth.  The table shows inconsistent variation between the three \napproaches but, comfortingly, the high resolution remote sensing estimates were \ngenerally close to those from the most accurate method, observation.  Because SWBs \nare, by definition, at the limit of present remote detection technologies, it has been \nhighly instructive to test the images currently available. \nAbout two-thirds of our SWBs have a surface area of less than 800 sq. m. We \nfound that remote sensing methods are not suitable for the inventory of SWBs with a \nsize of less than 200 sq. m and are not capable of detecting more than a portion of \nSWBs with a size of less than 80 sq. m. SWB signatures have a tendency for confusion \nwith other land surface features. Surrounding homestead vegetation is the noisiest \nelement for detection. The date and season when the remote sensing data are obtained is \nalso important. In the early dry season (November) most SWBs are full of water and \nsome are dry. We found more SWBs to be dry on a revisit in February\/March 2002. \nFigure 6 summarises our results for the number of different types of SWBs \nthrough time. As far as we are aware, this resource chronology is a first for Bangladesh. \nContrary to our expectations, the number of SWBs has increased rapidly over that \nperiod, mainly as a result of house building, and our best guess is that this will continue. \n< Figure 6 here > \nSince the completion of the field work and image analyses for this study, a new \nera of very high resolution, commercially available satellite images has begun. The \nIKONOS  and Quickbird satellites have been launched and are transmitting high-quality \nimagery with 1 m and 61 cm panchromatic resolution and 4 m and 2.4 m multispectral \nresolution respectively. Using merging techniques with such very high-resolution \nimagery should in future provide an even better means to identify most of the SWBs in \nBangladesh.  \n \nConclusion \n \nWe have described a research programme based on the novel combination of technical \nremote sensing and GIS with qualitative human geography fieldwork methods such as \nfocus groups and interviews with key informants.  Although not covered here, we also \nused participant observation and video methods to enhance our understanding of SWB \nuse and management.  From the point of view of the planners and policy-makers, we \nassert that it is possible to relate present government water policies to a dynamic of \n  \n13 \nwater resource management over three decades and to make some predictions for the \nfuture.  As we saw in Table V, it was possible to reconstruct the history of SWBs in \nfour rather different mouzas, showing a surprising increase in dobas and pukurs.  Many \nof these new SWBs are under-used, for instance for fisheries, or misused.  Better \nprovision of sanitary facilities would remove the need to use SWBs as cess pools and \nreduce the contamination that is threatening those who wish to use them for fish \nfarming, bathing or other domestic purposes.  The restoration of the strict usage codes \nthat were in place until the 1970s might even allow the allocation of some to drinking \nwater, a necessary step in view of the extensive problem of arsenic in groundwater.  But \nthe microbial loading of such surface waters that may have been acceptable in the 1970s \nis certainly not acceptable at present, and so water treatment measures will still be \nneeded, which raises the issue of expense.   \n \nNote \n1  We have kept the technical aspect of image interpretation to a minimum in this short \npaper but it is worth noting at this point that the ability to identify water bodies is often \nenhanced or inhibited by image tonal variations. \n \n \n  \n14 \nCAPTIONS \n \nTable I.
