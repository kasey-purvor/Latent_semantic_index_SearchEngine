Its cause is unknown but as many as 30% of patients have \ncontinuing facial disfigurement, psychological difficulties and occasionally facial \npain. We present a RCT based economic evaluation of the early administration of \nsteroids (prednisolone) and\/or antivirals (acyclovir) compared to placebo, for \ntreatment of BP. \nMethods \nThe RCT was not powered to detect differences in the cost-effectiveness (CEA); \ntherefore, we adopted a decision analytic model approach as a way of gaining \nprecision in our CEA comparisons (e.g. prednisolone only (PO) vs. acyclovir only \nvs. prednisolone and acyclovir vs. placebo; prednisolone vs. no prednisolone \n(NP) and acyclovir vs. no acyclovir (NA)). We assumed that trial interventions \naffect the probability of being cured\/not cured but their consequences are \nindependent of the initial therapy. We used the percentage of individuals with a \ncomplete recovery (based on House-Brackmann grade=1) at 9 months and \nQALYs (e.g. derived on responses to the Health Utilities Index 3) as measures of \neffectiveness. Other parameter estimates were obtained from trial data.  \nResults  \nPO dominated -i.e. was less costly and more effective- all other therapy strategies \nin the four arms model (77% probability of CE). Moreover, Prednisolone \ndominated  NP (77% probability of being cost effective (CE) at \u00a330,000 threshold) \nwhile NA dominated aciclovir (85% chance of CE), in the two arms models, \nrespectively.   \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n4 \nConclusions \nTreatment of BP with prednisolone is likely to be considered cost-effective while \ntreatment with aciclovir is highly unlikely to be considered cost-effective.  \nFurther data on costs and utilities would be useful to confirm findings. \nKEYWORDS  \nEconomic evaluation, Bell\u2019s Palsy, Prednisolone, Acyclovir, cost effectiveness \nanalysis, cost utility analysis.  \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n5 \nConflicts of interest \nNone \nSource of funding \nThe paper was developed from a Health Technology Assessment on the early \ntreatment with prednisolone or acyclovir in Bell\u2019s Palsy, funded by the National \nInstitute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme (project \nnumber HTA 02\/09\/04).  \nAcknowledgements  \nWe thank members of the BELLS Trial Group: Jillian M Morrison, PhD: Division \nof Community Based Sciences, University of Glasgow, Blair H Smith, MD: \nDepartment of General Practice and Primary Care, University of Aberdeen, Brian \nMcKinstry, MD: Community Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Richard J \nDavenport, DM: Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Edinburgh, \nJanet E Clarkson, PhD: Dental Health Services Research Unit, University of \nDundee, Ken Stewart, MD: St John\u2019s Hospital, NHS Lothian, Victoria \nHammersley, BSc: Community Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Sima \nHayavi, PhD: Division of Community Based Sciences, University of Glasgow, \nAnne McAteer, MSc: Department of General Practice and Primary Care, \nUniversity of Aberdeen, Denise Gray, MSc: Department of General Practice and \nPrimary Care, University of Aberdeen, Fergus Daly, PhD: Community Health \nSciences, University of Dundee.

Although most recover, as many as 30% of \npeople have a poor recovery with continuing facial disfigurement, psychological \ndifficulties and sometimes facial pain.(2-4) In the absence of an established \naetiology, treatment continues to be based upon the established pathophysiology: \nswelling and entrapment of the nerve. \n \nTwo Cochrane reviews have examined the effectiveness of oral prednisolone and \naciclovir for the treatment of Bell's palsy (5, 6) and both report insuffient evidence \non the effectiveness.  In addition, high dose steroid therapy has numerous \npotential side effects including peptic ulceration, hypertension and confusional \nstates.(7) Antiviral therapy is expensive and it has been argued should be \nreserved for circumstances where definite benefits are likely to be obtained.  \n \nGiven this lack of evidence the UK NHS R&D Health Technology Assessment \nProgramme commissioned a RCT to determine whether prednisolone or \naciclovir, used separately or in combination and used early in the course of Bell\u2019s \npalsy, is an effective and efficient treatment.  The aim of this paper is to report \nevidence on the relative efficiency of these therapies.   \n \n3 Methods \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n8 \n \nDetails of the RCT have been reported elsewhere.(8)  Briefly, this was a multi-\ncentre, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomised, factorial trial involving \npatients with Bell\u2019s palsy who were recruited within 72 hours after onset of \nsymptoms.  Five hundred and fifty one patients were recruited from primary \ncare settings and referred to 17 hospitals in Scotland between June 2004 and June \n2006, where eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 days of \ntreatment of: 25mg twice daily with prednisolone (n=138), or 400mg five times \ndaily with acyclovir (n=138), both agents (n=134), or placebo (n=141). Follow-up \nwas 9 months. The primary outcome was complete recovery of facial function as \nrated on the House-Brackmann scale. Secondary outcomes included quality of \nlife, appearance, pain, costs and relative efficiency.  The study included adults of \n16 years or older with unilateral facial weakness of no identifiable cause who \npresented to primary care or emergency department and could be referred to a \ncollaborating otorhinolaryngologist within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms. \nExclusion criteria were pregnancy, breast-feeding, diabetes, peptic ulcer disease, \nsuppurative otitis media, herpes zoster, multiple sclerosis, systemic infection, \nsarcoidosis and other rare conditions, and an inability to provide informed \nconsent. All participants gave written informed consent. The study was \napproved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee for Scotland. \n \nThe economic evaluation conducted as part of this trial adopted a modelling \napproach as a means of gaining precision in cost-effectiveness estimates. Decision \nanalytic models were constructed to compare the relative efficiency of the four \nrandomised arms and also for the 2 randomised comparisons from the 2x2 \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n9 \nfactorial design: prednisolone against no prednisolone and aciclovir against no \naciclovir.  As the time horizon of the economic analyses mirrors that of the \noriginal study, we believe this type of model gives a well representation of the \ndecision problem.  An example of the model structure is shown in Figure 1a. \nWithin these models it is assumed that the different trial interventions affect the \nprobability of being cured or not cured and the consequences are assumed to be \nindependent of the assigned therapy.   \n \n3.1 Parameter estimates used in the model \nParameter estimates for probabilities, costs and effectiveness required to \npopulate the model were developed from trial data. These data related to risk of \nbeing cured or not cured at different time points, health services resource use and \ncosts and health state utilities. \n \n3.1.1 Probability of cure and not cure \nTable 1 shows the proportion of subjects cured and not cured at three and nine \nmonths, used as probabilities within the model.  Normal probability distributions \nwere attached to the difference in proportions between groups to allow for \nparameter uncertainty.   \n \n3.1.2 Health care resource use and costs \nThe costs estimates used in the model were based on the cost of the initial \ntreatments and follow-up costs.  Follow-up costs included the use of resources in \nprimary and secondary care, and the subsequent use of other medications.  These \nresources were costed using readily available unit costs.  \n \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n10 \nTreatment costs \nThe doses and length of treatment for trial medications were defined by the trial \nprotocol. The unit costs were obtained from British National Formulary (BNF)(9), \n(Table 2a). \n \nFollow-up costs \nPrimary and secondary care resource use \nHealth Care resources used were collected from primary care case notes in a \nconvenience sample of 74 study subjects on any contacts made with health \nservices or resources used by trial participants. This sub-sample appears \nrepresentative of the whole study sample (see website Suplementary Data for \ndetails of baseline characteristics). The number of contacts are described in Table \n2b split by whether the data referred to cured or not cured patients (see website \nSupplementary Data for further details on Resource Use). Hospital based services \n(inpatient days, day cases, and outpatient visits) were costed using data from the \nInformation Services Department (ISD) for Scotland(10) after deducting \noverheads allocated to the particular cost category (see website Supplementary \nData).  Unit cost for primary care based services were obtained from Curtis & \nNetten 2006 (11) and from the BNF for medications.(9)  \n \nTotal Costs \nUsing all the data described above estimates of the total mean costs for those \ncured and not cured were estimated (Table 2b).  A simple ordinary least squared \n(OLS) regression was fitted to the data obtained from those people for whom \ndata were able to be collected (n=74).  The total mean values used within the \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n11 \nmodel were \u00a3210 (s.e. 58) for cured with not cured being \u00a3105 (s.e. 112) more \ncostly at three months.  Normal distributions were added to the total cost of \nbeing cured and not cured with the total cost of not cured bounded at zero \nwithin the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. \n \n3.1.3 Estimation of utilities \nThe RCT (8) collected data on Health Utilities Index mark III (HUI III) (12) at \nbaseline, three months and, if trial participants were not cured at three months, \nalso at nine months.  Two analyses of covariance adjusting for baseline HUI III \nscores were used to obtain utility weights for participants who were cured and \nnot cured at three and nine months (Table 3). In order to reflect the statistical \nimprecision surrounding these estimates when used in the model, normal \ndistributions were attached to the mean difference in values based upon the \nresults of a regression analysis.  \n \nBase case analysis \nBase case analysis was conducted for all four randomised arms (e.g. four arms \nmodel).  Secondary analyses comparing prednisolone vs. no prednisolone and \naciclovir vs. no aciclovir were also conducted.  For all analyses cumulative mean \ncosts were estimated for the nine months follow-up period of the trial.  All costs \nwere expressed in 2006\/07 pounds Sterling.  The perspective of the analyses was \nthat of the British National Health Service.  Effectiveness was measured in terms \nof number of cases cured (e.g. House-Brackmann score = 1), and mean QALYs \nfor the nine month time horizon.  As the time horizon for the analyses was less \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n12 \nthan a year, neither cost nor effectiveness outcomes were discounted.  \nIncremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated.   \n \nSensitivity analysis \nDeterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The latter \ninvolved attaching probability distributions to the model parameters and \nconducting Monte Carlo simulations (MCS). One thousand iterations were \nobtained for each MCS conducted.  These MCS were used to produce cost-\neffectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) \u2013Figure 2a- from which the likelihood \nof an intervention being considered cost-effective for society\u2019s willingness to pay \nat threshold values of \u00a310,000, \u00a320,000, \u00a330,000 and \u00a350,000 were calculated \n(Table 4) and cost-effectiveness scatterplots (Figure 2b & 2c).  CEACs for the two \narms models are reported as website Supplementary Data. \n \nFurther sensitivity analyses related to changes in key parameters used in the \nmodel e.g. unit cost values or to changes in model assumptions relating to the \nderivation of cost and the definition of cure.  Cost data are typically skewed to \nthe right as there are usually a few trial participants for which costs are extremely \nhigh. A sensitivity analysis was conducted taking these potential outliers out of \nthe analysis.   \n \nPotential drivers in these models are the probability of being cured or not cured \nat three months; therefore, threshold analysis was also used to explore the effect \nof the probability of being cured or not cured on the model results.  In addition, \nsubgroup analyses by age and sex were also performed.  Finally, structural \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n13 \nuncertainty was explored by assuming an exponential regression and gamma \nregression (together with gamma distributions for Monte Carlo simulations) \nanalyses for total costs instead of the original ordinary least squared regression. \n \n4 Results  \n4.1 Comparison of all four randomised groups \nOn average, prednisolone only is the least costly and most effective of the four \nalternative interventions (Table 4). Furthermore, it has approximately an 80% \nchance of being considered cost-effective compared with the other treatments \n(Figure 2a & Table 4).  \n \n4.2 Prednisolone vs. no prednisolone model \nWhen the proportion of cases cured (Cost-effectiveness analysis) or QALYs \n(Cost-utility analysis) are used as the measure of effectiveness prednisolone has a \nlower mean cost and is more effective than the no prednisolone alternative (Table \n4).  Thus, prednisolone dominates the \u2018no prednisolone intervention.  Table 4 also \nshows that prednisolone is likely to be considered a cost-effective treatment at all \nvalues for society\u2019s willingness to pay for a QALY. Figure 2b shows the cost-\neffectiveness scatterplot. The majority of the Monte Carlo simulation cost \neffectiveness result dots lay within the sout east quadrant and for these \nprednisolone treatment is more effective and less costly than no prednisolone \ntreatment. \n \n4.3 Aciclovir vs. no aciclovir model \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n14 \nTable 4 shows the incremental cost per case cured and per QALY for the \ncomparison of aciclovir with no aciclovir.  The no aciclovir alternative has on \naverage lower costs and a higher proportion of individuals recovered.  Therefore, \non average no aciclovir dominates aciclovir treatment. The probabilistic analysis \nreinforces this finding (Table 4 and Figure 2c). \n \n4.4 Sensitivity analysis \nA wide range of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results were not sensitive \nto the exclusion of the higher cost participants from the analysis, to halving or \ndoubling the unit costs, or when an exponential regression was used to estimate \ntotal cost for cured or not cured participants to allow the right skew for the cost \ndata. Prednisolone only appeared less likely to be considered cost-effective when \ngamma regression and gamma distributions were used. \n \nOne-way sensitivity analyses were conducted on the difference in the probability \nof being cured at three months. The 95%CI upper and lower limits for the \ndifference in cure rates were used for this (Table 1). Cost-effectiveness or cost-\nutility analyses results were not sensitive to these changes for prednisolone vs. \nno prednisone model.  \n \nHowever, results were sensitive to the probability of being cured at three months \nwithin the aciclovir vs. no aciclovir model. When the difference in the probability \nof being cured at three months between the aciclovir arm and no aciclovir arm \nwas 3.3% (the upper limit of the 95%CI), the ICER was \u00a39,576.  Further threshold \nanalyses were conducted and ICERs of about \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 were obtained \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n15 \nfor 2% and 1.5% differences in the absolute probability of cure, respectively.  \nTherefore, the confidence interval surrounding the difference in cure rates \nbetween aciclovir arm and no aciclovir arm is sufficiently wide to contain \nclinically and economically important differences.   \n \nAge group and gender \nRegression analyses for total cost and for utility weights show age group \nvariables as well as gender were statistically non-significant. Given these data no \nestimates of incremental cost per QALY were estimated for different age groups \nor by gender. \n \n4 Discussion \nThe results of the economic evaluation suggest that the use of prednisolone is \nlikely to be considered cost-effective.  Aciclovir, in contrast, appears to be on \naverage no more effective but more costly than no treatment or treatment with \nprednisolone.  Thus, it is unlikely to be considered cost-effective.  The time \nhorizon of the model was only nine months.  Therefore, an implicit assumption is \nthat there are no further benefits and cost savings from the use of prednisolone \nafter the end of the time horizon.  Given the difference in cure rates that existed \nat nine months it is possible that should the time horizon be extended treatment \nof Bell\u2019s palsy with prednisolone would be associated with further gains in \nquality of life.  Furthermore, it is likely that those who did not receive \nprednisolone would make more use of health services; thus, increasing their cost \nrelative to those who received prednisolone. \n \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n16 \nThe economic analysis used a modelling framework to estimate relative \nefficiency.  This approach has the advantage of making the best use of the limited \ndata available but it made the assumption that the main determinant of relative \nefficiency is whether or not the Bell\u2019s palsy was cured or not.   If a standard trial \nbased cost-effectiveness analysis had been conducted it is likely that, on average, \nsimilar but less precised results would have been obtained.  Furthermore, the \nlack of data on costs and the decision not to follow-up those deemed cured at \nthree months would have necessitated similar assumptions being made in order \nto handle the missing cost and utilities data(13).   \n \nThe data on costs used within the model came from a sample of only 74 of the \ntrial participants.  This led to a reduction in the precision of the estimates.   \nEfforts were made to obtain data from more trial participants but these efforts \nwere hampered by the fact that some general practices refused permission to \nview notes even though the participant had granted permission for their records \nto be reviewed.  This appeared to be caused by uncertainty over whether the \nprior consent to view notes would still apply several months after initial \nrecruitment of the participant and also the inconvenience of allowing \ninvestigators access to the practice Despite this limitation these data appear \nrepresentative of the whole sample and the reasons for non-response were \nunconnected to the therapy the participant received or their outcomes (see \nadditional web tables 1a & 1b).  With respect to the estimation of QALYs \nmeasurements of health state utilities were censored for those trial participants \nwho were judged to be cured at the three month follow-up.  Therefore an \nassumption was made within the modelling exercise that was tantamount to \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n17 \nimputing utility data using the \u2018last value carried forward\u2019 method.  Ordinarily \nthis approach while simple is normally considered to be a limited method of \nimputation.(14, 15)  However, in this situation it may not be wholly unrealistic as \nthese trial participants were judged to be cured at the time of censoring.  \nNevertheless, it assumes that there is no possible further improvement in health \nstatus for these people nor is there any possibility of relapse.  This latter situation \nis clinically implausible unless there is an unrelated new episode of Bell\u2019s palsy.  \nThe results of the economic evaluation would have been strengthened by further \ndata on both costs and health state utilities.   \n \nWithin the model the results are driven by the probability of being cured at three \nmonths and to a lesser extent, the probability of being cured at nine months.  \nBoth probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted.  The \nprobabilistic sensitivity analysis focused on the statistical imprecision \nsurrounding the model parameters using parameter distributions that were \nplausible and based upon the available data.  Further deterministic sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted to address uncertainty in the model structure or \nuncertainty surrounding model parameters that were obtained from outwit the \nRCT.  The results of these sensitivity analyses indicate that conclusions are only \nsensitive to assumptions on the probability of being cured for the aciclovir vs. no \naciclovir model. \n \nConclusions  \nOverall, based on the data available it appears that treatment of Bell\u2019s palsy with \nprednisolone is likely to be considered cost-effective while treatment with \nHern\u00e1ndez et al. \n18 \naciclovir is highly unlikely to be considered cost-effective.  Given the limited data \navailable on costs and utilities further data would be useful to confirm findings.  \nSimilarly even though it is unlikely to change conclusion further data on costs \nand outcomes in the longer term (i.e. for a follow-up greater than nine months) \nwould also serve to confirm the findings of the study.  \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n19 \nReferences  \n1.

Therefore, for those cases, \nEconomic Evaluation of Bell\u2019s Palsy early treatment \n 27 \nprednisolone produced more QALYs and was less costly than no prednisolone and \nprednisolone is cost-effective for these iterations.  The opposite argument applies to those \ncases that fall within the NW quadrant (e.g. no prednisolone option is cost-effective).  \nFinally, for those iterations that fall within the NE and SW quadrants the decision for or \nagainst prednisolone will depend on threshold value of WTP for an extra QALY.  \n \nFigure 2c Incremental cost effectiveness scatterplot.
