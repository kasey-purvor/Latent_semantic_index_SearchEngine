Semi-solid processing involves forming metallic alloys between the \nsolidus and the liquidus. For the process to operate, the microstructure must \nconsist of solid spheroids in the liquid matrix, rather than dendrites. The \nmaterial then flows when it is sheared but thickens again when allowed to \nstand, i.e. it behaves thixotropically. This type of behaviour was first discovered \nby Flemings and co-workers in the 1970s and is utilized in a family of \nprocesses, some now applied commercially. Here the current status of semi-\nsolid processing, both technologically and from a research point of view, will \nbe reviewed.  \nKeywords: semi-solid processing; thixoforming; rheoforming; thixocasting; \nthixoforging. \n1   Introduction \nIn the early 1970s, a PhD student at MIT in the US was studying hot tearing of \ncasting alloys by using a rheometer to measure the viscosity as he cooled into the \nsemi-solid state. He found that if he was stirring the material continuously during \ncooling it showed less resistance to shear than if the material was cooled into the \nsemi-solid state and then stirred.1 The student and his supervisor identified that the \nmicrostructure of the continuously stirred materials was spheroidal (i.e. consisted of \nspheroids of solid in the liquid matrix), whereas the material which was cooled into \nthe semi-solid state without stirring was dendritic (Fig. 1). The material with the \nspheroidal microstructure in the semi-solid state was thixotropic i.e. when it is \nsheared it thins and flows, when it is allowed to stand it thickens again.2 This property \ncan be exploited in semi-solid processing where the material is forced to fill a die. In \ncomparison with die casting, where the flow is turbulent, here the flow is smooth and \nlaminar and hence the resulting mechanical properties are enhanced. Consequently, \nparts can be made with thinner sections and hence lighter weight. As the material does \nnot have to cool all the way from the liquid state there is less solidification shrinkage \nand therefore parts can be made closer to net shape. The lower temperatures than die \ncasting mean less die attrition. In addition, parts can be heat treated and the surface \nfinish is improved. In comparison with forging, complex shapes can be made in one \nshot, including undercuts, and less force is needed, hence the machinery can be on a \nsmaller scale. \n \nThe discovery of the thixotropic behaviour of semi-solid metallic alloys has led to the \ndevelopment of a family of processing routes. Initially, a spheroidal microstructure \nhas to be obtained. Sometimes this is a prior step (as in thixoforming, thixoforging and \nthixocasting) and sometimes it is integral to the forming process itself (as in \nrheocasting, thixomolding and rheodiecasting). \n    \nIn Fig. 2, one route to the spheroidal microstructure is shown as stirring. There are, \nhowever, a range of potential feedstock production routes and these will be discussed \nfurther in section 2. After stirring, the material can be solidified and cut into billet. It \nis then reheated. If the reheated billet is placed into the shot chamber of a die casting \nmachine and forced into the die, this is termed thixocasting and usually the fraction of \nliquid is around 60% or more. If the semi-solid billet is placed between closed dies \nthen it is thixoforging and the fraction solid will be quite high (around 60% or more). \nThixoforming, as a term, is sometimes used to cover both thixocasting and \nthixoforging, or to cover a hybrid process where the billet is placed on a ram (rather \nthan in a shot sleeve) and forced into a die. In the diagram, \u2018deformed billet\u2019 means \nthat the route to a spheroidal microstructure involves deformation in the solid state. \nOn reheating into the semi-solid state, the material recrystallises and liquid is formed \naround the new grains, which are fine and equiaxed. In rheocasting, (and in the \nrelated routes rheodiecasting and thixomolding\u00ae), the feedstock is not solidified after \nstirring but rather taken straight from the semi-solid state into the die casting machine. \nIn section 2, feedstock production routes will be discussed in more detail and in \nsection 3 the semi-solid processing routes. Section 4 will cover industrial applications, \nsection 5 rheology of semi-solid material, section 6 modelling and section 7 the \ncurrent status with respect to which alloys can be semi-solid processed. The field has \nbeen reviewed4-9 and two books have been published recently.10,11 \n \n2   Routes to Spheroidal Feedstock  \n \n2.1   Mechanisms of Spheroid Formation \n \nFrom the liquid state, spheroids can form by dendrite fragmentation with the arms \nbreaking off at their roots due to shear forces, or the dendrite arms melting at their \nroots, or dendrite arm bending causing dislocation generation followed by the \nformation of grain boundaries and grain boundary wetting.5 Alternatively, the \nconditions for dendrite formation may not be met. For example, constitutive \nsupercooling will not occur if liquid is stirred to homogenise solute concentrations or \nif the material is held isothermally. The solid state routes to spheroidal feedstock are \nessentially based around the fact that deformed material will recrystallise as it is \nheated and the liquid will tend to form at the recrystallised boundaries.6 \n \n2.2 Liquid Metal Routes \n \nLiquid metal routes can be divided into those which involve agitation and those \nwhich do not. Semi-solid material can be vigorously stirred with a mechanical stirrer \nbut this tends to lead to unacceptable erosion of the stirrer and contamination. In the \nshear cooling roll technique,12 liquid metal is poured between a rotating roll and a \nstationary cooling shoe. Passive stirring involves the liquid being forced through a \nstatic mixing device (such as a column containing glass spheres) where the geometry \nensures high mixing without turbulence.13-16  Sprayforming is the atomisation of melt \ninto a spray followed by collection of droplets on a substrate. This gives a very fine \nspheroidal microstructure when remelted and allows alloys which cannot be made by \nother routes to be fabricated.17 However, it is relatively expensive. The \u2018new MIT \nprocess\u2019 (Fig. 3) is a hybrid of stirring and near liquidus casting.18 The melt is held \njust above the liquidus and a cooling finger, which also acts as a stirrer, is inserted. \nThe melt is cooled to just below the liquidus and the finger withdrawn. This generates \na cloud of nuclei. This process is very interesting from a commercial point of view. \nThe most important agitation route to date industrially has been \nmagnetohydrodynamic stirring (MHD).4 High local shear is generated by rotating, \nlinear or helicoidal electromagnetic fields (thereby avoiding contamination, gas \nentrapment and stirrer erosion), with stirring deep in the sump of the liquid. The alloy \nis filtered and degassed before treatment and a fine spheroidal size of about 30\u00b5m \nresults. There is some lack of uniformity and spheroids may retain some \u2018rosette\u2019 \ncharacter, a factor which influences flow. The majority of material which has been \nthixoformed commercially in the last twenty years has been produced by the MHD \nroute. \nThere have been significant new developments more recently, including the SEED \n(Swirled Enthalpy Equilibration Device) by Alcan. This involves, firstly, the rapid \nextraction of a controlled quantity of heat from the molten metal charge in order to \ngenerate a semi-solid slurry and, then, draining away the excess liquid leaving behind \na compact self-supporting slug which can then be handled and formed under pressure. \nThe \u2018new rheocasting (NRC) process\u2019 patented by UBE,19,20 is an example of a \nroute which does not involve agitation. Molten metal at near-liquidus temperature is \npoured into a tilted crucible. Grain nucleation occurs on the side of the crucible and \nthe grain size is fine because the temperature is near-liquidus. To date this has been \nthe most important of the rheocasting-type routes from a commercial point of view. \nOther non-agitation routes include the Direct Thermal Method (DTM),21 where \nliquid alloy with a low superheat is poured into a cylindrical metallic mould of very \nlow thermal mass but high thermal conductivity. Heat matching between the alloy and \nthe mould results in a pseudo-isothermal hold within the solidification range. This is a \nlow cost method ideal for the laboratory environment but with a strong limitation on \nthe size of the billet that can be produced.  \nIn the Cooling Slope method,e.g. 22 liquid metal is poured down a cooled slope and \ncollects in a mould. Nucleation on the slope ensures the spheroid size is fine. This \nshows considerable potential for combination with rolling (Fig. 4) but there issues of \ngas entrapment and oxide formation on the slope.  \nA number of manufacturers have aimed to use grain refinement to suppress \ndendrite growth eg. titanium diboride in aluminium alloys. It has proved difficult to \nobtain uniform grain sizes less than 100\u00b5m and the volume of liquid entrapped in \nspheroids tends to be high (entrapped liquid does not contribute to flow). \nA new route has recently been developed which is gaining considerable \ncommercial interest.24 It involves bringing two precursor alloys of precisely \ncontrolled composition, temperature and quantity into intimate contact and then \ncasting the resultant alloy using a conventional casting process. This yields a \ncomponent of a predetermined composition with a spheroidal microstructure.  \n \n2.3   Solid State Routes \n \nThe main solid state routes are Strain induced Melt Activated (SIMA)25 and \n(RAP),26 both of which have been used commercially. These are compared in Fig. 5. \nEssentially, as stated earlier, the material is deformed for example by extrusion and \nthen reheated into the semi-solid state. Recrystallisation occurs and the liquid forms \naround the grains which are fine and equiaxed. The distinction between SIMA and \nRAP is that the former involves hot working (above the recrystallisation temperature) \nand the latter warm working. SIMA, therefore, requires an intermediate additional \ncold work step. RAP is, however, more limited in the billet size because it is difficult \nto introduce deformation uniformly across the section (and for successful \nthixoforming a  uniform spheroidal microstructure is required). The advantages of \nthese routes are that many alloys are supplied in the extruded (or rolled) state anyway \nand the spheroids tend to be more rounded, giving better flow than the \u2018rosette-type\u2019 \nstructures sometimes found, for example, with the MHD route.  \n \nIt has become clear that some materials are readily thixoformable when reheated \nfrom the state which they are usually supplied in e.g. high performance steels.27 \n \n3.   Semi-Solid Processing Routes \n \n3.1   Rheocasting \n \n   In rheocasting, alloy is cooled into the semisolid state and injected into a die \nwithout intermediate solidification. The non-dendritic microstructure can be obtained \nby (see section 2): mechanical stirring; stimulated nucleation of solid particles (as in \nthe NRC process); electromagnetic stirring in the shot sleeve (the Hitachi process28); \nor by sub-liquidus casting (the THT process).29 The NRC process is shown in figure \n6. The inversion of the billet causes the oxide skin to run into the biscuit and runner. \nWith the NRC process, there is no need for specially treated thixoformable feedstock \nand scrap can be readily recycled within the plant. However, there is a lack of \nflexibility; the crucible size and heating\/cooling arrangements are specific to that \nvolume of metal.  \nIn sub-liquidus casting (Fig. 7),29 no processing equipment other than a die casting \nmachine with a large shot diameter and a short stroke is required. The product \nemerges free of gates so no trimming is needed. The melt is chemical grain refined. \n \n \n3.2.   Rheomoulding \n \nRheomoulding is allied to polymer injection moulding. It employs either a single \nscrew30,31 or a twin screw.32,33 Liquid metal is fed into a barrel where it is cooled \nwhile being mechanically stirred by a rotating screw. The semisolid is then injected \ninto a die cavity. This allows the continuous production of large quantities of \ncomponents and no specially produced feedstock material is needed. Workers at \nBrunel University are in commercial trials of what they call the Rheodiecasting \n(RDC) process34 (Fig. 8) having found a solution to the challenge of what material to \nuse for the screw and the barrel to avoid interaction with aluminium alloys. \n \n3.3   Thixomoulding \n \nThixomolding\u00ae is licensed by a firm called Thixomat. Many firms in Japan, the US \nand the Far East use the process to produce components from magnesium alloys. \nMagnesium alloy pellets are fed into a continuously rotating screw. The process is \ntherefore similar to rheodiecasting but the starting material is solid pellets rather than \nliquid. The energy generated by shearing contributes to heating the pellets into the \nsemisolid state (but some additional heating is applied). The screw action produces \nthe spheroidal microstructure and the material is fed into a die. One of the advantages \nof the process is that it allows forming with a range of solid fractions from 5% to 60% \n(although typically it tends to be relatively low). \n \n \n3.4   Thixoprocesses \n \nIn thixocasting, the material is solid initially and the alloy has been treated in such \na way that when it is reheated into the semisolid state a spheroidal microstructure is \nobtained. The liquid content is relatively high (>50vol.%). Reheating can be in a \nradiant furnace or an induction heating furnace. The high liquid fractions mean that \nthe billet tends to collapse and is therefore tipped into the shot sleeve from a \ncontainer. This process has been used commercially for making fuel rails for cars. \nThixoforging35,36 involves heating the feedstock into the semisolid state and \nplacing it between die halves. The parts of the die are then brought together. Material \nis used efficiently because of the lack of runners, gates and press discard. The liquid \nvolume fraction is generally less than 50 vol.% so that the billet can be handled. The \nprocess has not been used commercially, perhaps because of the difficulty in \nobtaining repeatability.  \nIn thixoforming,e.g. 17 the billet is heated as a vertical cylinder (in contrast with \nthixocasting) and then injected into the die, either horizontally or vertically. The \nliquid content is between 30 and 50 vol.%. A range of automotive and other \ncomponents have been produced by this route in industry. Billets are heated on a \ncarousel with induction. Process control is demanding but cycle times are very \ncomparable with those in die casting, and indeed may be faster because full \nsolidification is not required. \n \n \n4   Industrial Practice and Applications \n \n4.1   Process Issues \n \nFor the rheocasting routes heating of the feedstock billet is not required. However, \nfor the thixoprocesses the general method is to use induction heating in a carousel \narrangement so that a billet is always ready for processing. The induction heating \nsequence may be step-wise in order to obtain as uniform a temperature profile across \nthe billet as possible (given that induction heating works through the skin effect). \nProcess control is demanding because the spheroidal microstructure must be as \nuniform as possible across the cross-section with a consistent liquid\/solid fraction. \nThe viscous slug must retain its shape until the shear force is applied. Experience \nshows that it is difficult to obtain satisfactory thixoprocessing unless the equipment \nhas real-time and closed loop control. For example, feedback must occur so that, as \nthe ram makes its stroke, the velocity is constantly monitored and controlled to given \nvalues. Otherwise, as the ram forces material into the die and encounters increasing \nresistance, it will slow down. In practice, successful semi-solid processing is based \naround optimised profiles for pressure and velocity versus time. \n \n4.2   Examples of Commercial Components \n \nComponents made by thixoforming because of the near net shape requirement \ninclude: computer heat sinks (see figure 9); industrial bolt connectors; racing bike \nswing arms; computer disk drive motor bases and mountain bike suspension parts. For \nother parts, it is the capability to achieve enhanced mechanical properties which is \nsignificant eg. motorcycle chassis frame arms and mountain bike forks. In some cases, \nthixoforming can produce a component which is pressure tight where die casting \ncannot, for example, intricately shaped gas control valves. One of the problems with \ndie casting is the incorporation of oxide films because of the turbulent flow; this does \nnot occur with semi-solid processing where the flow into the die is smooth and \nlaminar. Other examples of leak-tight, pressurized applications include: master brake \ncylinders; ABS system valves; missile connector supports and airbag canisters. All \nthese are made from aluminium alloys, usually A356 or A357 in the heat treated \ncondition. \nMany components for mobile phones, laptops and automotive applications are \nmade from magnesium alloys by thixomoulding (Figs. 10 and 11). \n \n \n5   Experimental Determination of the Parameters for Semi-Solid \nProcessing \n \n5.1   Background Rheology \n \nFig. 12 shows different potential types of fluid behavior. In a Newtonian fluid, the \nshear stress is proportional to the shear rate, and the constant of proportionality is the \nviscosity \u03b7. Thixotropic fluids are non-Newtonian i.e. the shear stress is not \nproportional to the shear rate. The viscosity is then termed the apparent viscosity and \nis dependent on shear rate, pressure, temperature and time. Some non-linear fluids \nalso show viscoelasticity i.e. they store some of the mechanical energy as elastic \nenergy. Thixotropic materials are generally thought not to store energy elastically and \nshow no elastic recovery when the stress is removed. However, Favier and Atkinson37  \nhave recently shown that to accurately model the initial stages of the rapid \ncompression response of thixotropic billets, an assumption of elastic behavior by the \ninterconnected solid skeleton prior to deformation is required.  \nIf a fluid exhibits a yield stress and then gives a linear relationship between shear \nstress and shear rate, it is termed a Bingham material.                                                                                   \nThe Herschel-Bulkley model is where behaviour is non-linear after yield.                                                                                                          \nThere is dispute over whether thixotropic semi-solid alloys display yield and \nwhether they should be modelled as such. Barnes38 concluded, in a review of \nthixotropy which did not include semisolid metallic alloy materials as such, that the \npresence of a yield stress as reported by some workers for thixotropic materials is \nprobably due to the limitations of their experimental apparatus in not being able to \nmeasure shear stresses at very low shear rates. Koke and Modigell39 have, however, \nused a shear stress controlled rheometer to measure yield stress directly on Sn15%Pb. \nThey distinguish between a static yield stress where the fluid is at rest prior to the \napplication of a shear stress, and a dynamic yield stress where the fluid is being \ncontinuously sheared.  The yield stress increases with rest time prior to deformation \nbecause of the increasing degree of agglomeration of the spheroids of solid. In terms \nof modelling semi-solid alloy die fill, the use of a yield stress may be appropriate \nbecause a vertical billet does not collapse under its own weight unless the liquid \nfraction is too high. In addition, in rapid compression experiments (to be described \nlater) an initial peak in the load versus displacement curve is detected.  \nThe Ostwald de Waele relationship ( nk\u03b3\u03c4 \uf026= ) is used to describe fluids which do \nnot have a yield point and where there is a power law relationship between the shear \nstress \u03c4 and the shear rate. If the exponent n is 1, this reduces to the expression for a \nNewtonian fluid with the constant k equal to the viscosity \u03b7. A shear thinning material \n(whose viscosity decreases as the shear rate increases) would have a value of n of less \nthan 1 and a shear thickening material would have n greater than one. Thixotropic \nmaterials are essentially shear thinning but also thicken again when allowed to rest \n(i.e. all thixotropic materials are shear thinning but not all shear thinning fluids are \nthixotropic).  \nFor a thixotropic material at rest, when a step increase in shear rate is imposed, the \nshear stress will peak and then gradually decrease until it reaches an equilibrium value \nfor the shear rate over time (Fig. 13). The higher the shear rate after the step, the \nlower the equilibrium viscosity. The peak viscosity encountered will increase with \nincreasing rest time before it recovers back to the equilibrium viscosity of the shear \nrate specified. \nIn semi-solid metallic alloys (as in other thixotropic materials such as clays, \nmousses, emulsions and flocs), the thixotropic behaviour is associated with \nagglomeration and disagglomeration. When the material is allowed to stand, or stirred \nat a low shear rate, spheroids link together to form agglomerates (figure 14). With a \nstep change up in shear rate, the agglomerates are broken down and the viscosity \ndecreases towards a new equilibrium level. \nThe higher the shear rate (faster stirring) then the lower the viscosity. The higher \nthe fraction solid the higher the viscosity. If the shear rate is changed, then over a \nperiod of time the viscosity will reach a new equilibrium value (steady state). The \nviscosity in the steady state depends on the balance between agglomeration and \ndisagglomeration and also on particle morphology; pure spheres give the lowest \nviscosity. Liquid entrapped within the spheres does not contribute to shear flow. \n \n \n5.2   Transient Versus Steady State Behaviour \n \n \nIn semi-solid processing, the injection into the die takes less than one second. If the \nmaterial is initially at rest (as in thixoforming), in that fraction of a second the \nviscosity is changing by orders of magnitude from 106 Pas to 103 Pas (equivalent to \nthat of heavy machine oil). (The viscosity change will be less in rheocasting type \nprocesses where there has been insufficient time in a rest state for the agglomeration \nto occur to a great extent). For modelling, we need to use computational fluid \ndynamics (or for high solid fractions a \u2018soft forging\u2019 type of approach), but the issue \nis essentially where to derive the material parameters from. Several workers have \ncarried out rheological experiments to obtain data on the steady state,2,3,41-44 but there \nis little information on transients. \nAfter a shear rate increase, there is a characteristic time for the slurry to achieve the \nsteady state. Quaak3 deduced that in fact there are at least two processes occurring \n(figure 15) and therefore the breakdown should be represented with a double \nexponential. At the instant after a jump up in shear rate, Quaak argues that the \nstructure is the same (\u2018isostructure\u2019). Very quickly deagglomeration occurs and then \nover a slower time scale the fragments spheroidise and coarsen by diffusion. It is the \nvery fast process which is most relevant to transient behaviour in thixoforming and \nhence we must design experiments to investigate that. \n \nRheometry. \n \nA rheometer can be used to carry out rapid changes in shear rate.3,39,40,45-51 The \nadvantage of a rheometer is that the shear rate in the gap between the bob and the cup \ncan essentially be treated as uniform (but note some concerns which are now \nemerging52]. A typical experiment would involve stirring the alloy (usually Sn15%Pb \nas a model because few rheometers will operate at semisolid aluminium temperatures) \nwhile cooling from above the liquidus point to the required semisolid temperature (to \nwithin 1C) to obtain a non-dendritic microstructure. Stirring continues until an \napparent steady state is obtained with the specimen protected from oxidation by \npassing inert gas over the material. Shear rate jumps for several different rest times \nand initial and final shear rates can be obtained. Typical results are shown in figure \n16.40 The challenge experimentally is to collect data very rapidly during the shear rate \njump (1 Hz in this case) and to separate out the behaviour of the rheometer from the \nbehaviour of the material. It is important to correct for the inertia of the measuring \nhead (by subtracting from the data the results for the same test but in air) and to allow \nfor any electronic switching that occurs during the shear rate change by only using \ndata from after when 90% of the final shear rate is achieved. \nBreakdown times can be obtained by fitting an exponential to the data obtained in \nthe second after 90% of the specified final shear rate has been achieved. The longer \nthe rest time prior to the shear rate jump, the lower (ie. slower) the breakdown time \ndue to increased solid particle sizes and degree of agglomeration. These increases \nwould impede the movement of particles when the shear stress is imposed. The peak \nviscosity increases with rest time because of the greater degree of agglomeration. The \n\u2018first steady state viscosity\u2019 increases with rest time. The \u2018first steady state viscosity\u2019 \nis a pseudo steady\u2013state between the fast disagglomeration process and the slower \ndiffusion process (figure 15). It is not a full steady state. The breakdown time for the \nfast disagglomeration process is about 0.15s.40 The ease with which the particles flow \npast each other depends on the particle size, the fraction liquid and the degree of \nagglomeration. The breakdown time is independent of the initial shear rate but \ncontrolled by the final specified shear rate. Breakdown is faster for higher final shear \nrates and faster than recovery. \nThe challenge now for rheometry is to obtain data for steels, e.g.53 despite the \ndifficulties with operating rheometers at these higher temperatures.  \n \nRapid Compression Experiments. \n \n \nThe difficulty with rheometers is that there are few that can operate above about \n50% solid (because the torque that is required is too high). However, thixoprocessing \noften takes place with around 60%. One possibility is then to use the thixoformer \nitself (or a hydraulic press) to carry out rapid compression experiments.54-57 The shear \nrates and temperatures are then akin to those in the process itself. However, in \ncontrast with a rheometer, the shear rate varies from point to point within the volume \nof the material. There are two ways of approaching this. One is to assume an average \nshear rate applies across the material volume. The other is to model the compression \nprocess with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), which, in itself, requires the \nmaterial parameters one is aiming to measure. Those material parameters then have to \nbe obtained by an iterative process, fitting the CFD results to the experiment. \nFigure 17 shows a typical signal response to rapid compression.57 The peak load is \nthought to represent the resistance to flow of the skeletal structure connecting \nagglomerates. There is rapid breakdown under shear (within 10ms). The peak \ndecreases with increase in temperature (and hence fraction liquid). It increases with \nincreasing soaking time prior to compression as the skeletal structure is built up. \nThe load versus displacement response can be obtained by using a load cell \narrangement.57 Recent experiments have shown that the load can also be obtained \nfrom data from the ram operation without the need for a load cell.58 Typical results \nobtained using the averaging approach (and assuming Newtonian behaviour in the \nanalysis; a shortcoming) are shown in figure 18. Shear thinning occurs with an \nincrease in shear rate. With increase in temperature, the viscosity decreases. The CFD \ntype of approach has not been fully developed and is discussed further below because \nit is inherently a modelling approach. \n \n \n6   Modelling \n \nThere have been a variety of approaches to modeling.e.g.9 Illustrative highlights are \ngiven here. CFD approaches include finite difference, both one and two phase, and \nfinite element, again both one and two phase. Micro-macro modelling is also under \ninvestigation.59 The power of modelling is illustrated in figure 19. \nIn the interrupted filling with the original die design there are defects where the \nmaterial is flowing back on itself, with the flow front having been disrupted by the \nbolt holes and the central boss. The simulation mimics this well. An improved die \ndesign widens the ingate, removing the constriction typical of a die casting ingate. \nThe flow front is then relatively smooth. In practice, the improved die design gave \nexcellent results. \nMuch of the modelling work in the literature is based around the model of Brown \nand co-workers60-2 where a structure coefficient \u03bb is introduced which varies between \n0 for a structure which is fully broken down (disagglomerated) to 1 for a structure \nwhich is fully built up (agglomerated). The flow resistance is due to the \nhydrodynamic flow of agglomerates and the deformation of solid particles within \nagglomerates. The rate of change of \u03bb is a balance between agglomeration and \ndisagglomeration, with the latter dependent on shear rate because the rupture of \nparticle-particle bonds is shear induced. \n \n6.1   Finite Difference One Phase Modelling \nModigell and Koke50 have used a one phase finite difference model (based on \nFLOW3D from FLOWSCIENCE Inc) to examine flow around an obstacle. Figure 20 \nillustrates the startling difference in behaviour between a Newtonian fluid and a \nthixotropic one. \nIt is important to check that the model can predict not only the flow front but also \nthe rheometer results.63 Results from FLOW3D are shown in figure 21, this time \nusing an ADI solver developed by FLOWSCIENCE to cope with the fact that in \nthixoforming the viscosity and shear rate change by orders of magnitude over very \nshort distances and times. \nA number of workers have used the MAGMAsoft package with the thixotropic \nmodule (finite difference, one phase) and obtained reasonable agreement between \ninterrupted filling tests and the simulation.e.g.64,65 \n \n6.2   Finite Element One Phase Modelling \n \nAlexandrou and co-workers52, 66-70 have carried out important work with a finite \nelement one phase model, with a continuous Bingham law to avoid the discontinuity \nat the yield stress. The work has explored the relative importance of the inertial, yield \nstress and viscous flow effects. \nAlexandrou and co-workers have been able to predict the regimes under which \nvarious flow patterns occur (figures 22 and 23) and in particular the conditions where \ndefects such as the \u2018toothpaste instability\u2019 are found.  \nOrgeas et al.71 use a Power Law Cut-Off model in the PROCAST package (figure \n24). Shear thinning only occurs if a cut-off value is exceeded. This can be set at \ndifferent values in different parts of the component. The behaviour is, therefore, \nratchet-type i.e. an increase of the shear rate beyond the largest shear rate experienced \nso far will lead to decrease in viscosity. Otherwise the viscosity is unchanged. Orgeas \net al. also observe that, under certain conditions, flow leads to the concentration of \nliquid in veins in the structure.  \n \n \n6.3   Finite Element Two Phase Modelling \n \nTwo phase models can predict phase separation.72-80 However, the determination of \nthe rheological parameters required is not straightforward. Modigell and co-workers80 \nhave used a finite element two phase model to predict regimes of behaviour (figure \n25) and validated the results with Sn15%Pb by filming die filling (figure 26).81  \n \n \n6.4   Micro-Macro Modelling \n \n   Favier et al.59 proposed a constitutive equation accounting for the mechanical role of \nfour phases within the material: the solid globules; the solid bonds; the entrapped \nliquid; and the free liquid. An internal variable which modifies the liquid-solid spatial \ndistribution captures the evolution of the microstructure with the shear rate. The \nmodel was originally established in a viscoplastic framework and has been shown to \npredict the characteristics of the transient response for shear rate jumps for solid \nfraction lower than 0.5.59 It is now being extended to include elastic behavior because \nthe initial sharp rise to a peak in rapid compression tests is not consistent with \nviscoplastic behavior.37 In the latest results this sharp rise can be modeled (figure 27).   \n \n \n6.5   Experimental Validation \n \nApparatus for filming die filling has been reported.81,82 One of the challenges \nwhich has been overcome is the need for an effective arrangement with the window, \nwhich is also inexpensive, for use with aluminium alloys, where the high \ntemperatures are problematic. There are advantages to observing the flow in situ. \nInterrupted filling tests have disadvantages as the material can continue to travel, \nbecause of inertia, after the ram is stopped. Results are shown in figures 28. Note that \nwith a broader obstacle the flow fronts meet when the die is more full.  \nOverall, for modelling, there are few examples of direct comparison between \nmodels, few examples of quantitative comparison between flow fronts and \npredictions, and few examples of in situ observation of die filling. \n \n7   Alloys for Semi-Solid Processing \n \nThe range of alloys available for semi-solid processing and the research to widen \nthe range of applicability has been reviewed.83 More recently there has been \nsignificant work on steel alloys for thixoforming.84,85 \n \nVirtually all the existing commercial activity is with aluminium casting alloys, \nparticularly A356 and A357, and with magnesium alloys (in the case of \nthixomolding). Typical properties for aluminium alloys from Vforge (one of the main \nsuppliers of semi-solid processed aluminium alloys) are  241 MPa yield strength for \nA356 in the T6 condition (with 10-12% elongation) and 262 MPa for A357, again in \nthe T6  condition, (elongation 8-10%). \n \nThere is extensive interest in semi-solid processing higher strength aluminium \nalloys, which are normally wrought, and higher temperature materials such as copper \nbased alloys, cast irons and steels. In addition, there is increasing interest in \ncomposites. Some results for the normally wrought Al alloys are shown in figure 29. \nThe results here show that it is ductility which is the major challenge; the yield \nstrengths are close to target (although the target is exceeded with the high strength \ncasting alloy 201) and, for ductility, with 6082. The difficulty here is separating out \nthe processing defects which are inherent to the composition of the alloy and those \nwhich are due to laboratory scale methods of making spheroidal microstructure \nmaterial. For example, some of these results have been obtained with material from a \ncooling slope and there are questions as to whether oxide has been incorporated as the \nmaterial has flowed down the slope. However, wrought composition alloys are \ninherently vulnerable to hot tearing, and, at least in part, the ductility problems are \nassociated with that. This is because the freezing range tends to be relatively wide \nwith a long \u2018tail\u2019 during the final stages of solidification. There has been extensive \ndiscussion in the literature about the design of high strength alloys specifically for  \nsemi-solid processing,83, 87-95 with consideration of the freezing range and the rate of \nliquid formation within the semi-solid processing range. Thermodynamic prediction is \npotentially a useful tool in this. There is no commercial production of high strength \nalloys yet. \nThere has been some exploration of copper alloys, particularly in the context of motor \nsquirrel cages (where the alloying element can, in fact, be oxygen, to obtain a freezing \nrange, whilst maintaining a relatively high electrical conductivity. However, currently \nthere is not known to be any commercial application. \nConsiderable attention is being focussed on steels,e.g.84,85 and has included the \ndevelopment of steel compositions specifically designed for thixoforming (figure 30). \n \nThe modified alloy gives a relatively low melting temperature and temperature for \n50% liquid (a critical consideration for thixoforming) in comparison with the non-\nmodified compositions. The slope at 50% liquid and at the end of solidification are \nalso relatively low. The latter is a key criterion for avoiding hot tearing according to \nKazakov.89 \n The highly alloyed steels (such as tool steels) are the most amenable and show good \nresults for short runs. However, to some extent, the lack of availability of commercial \nequipment suitable for such production (eg. with the facility to avoid oxidation during \nthe high temperature heating) has limited the exploration of long run production \nissues. Tool materials need development. These issues have been recently reviewed.96  \nOther high temperature materials under investigation include ductile irons,97 \nstellites98 and high performance steels.27 Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) are also \nof interest.e.g.17  \n \n \n8   Concluding Remarks \n \nThe current status of semi-solid processing has been reviewed. The discovery of \nthixotropic behaviour in semi-solid alloys with spheroidal rather than dendritic \nmicrostructures has been described. The terminology has been introduced and the \norigin of the behaviour identified. Routes to feedstock material, and the continuing \nfertility of ideas in this area, have been described. The distinctions between process \nroutes have been highlighted and the continuing developments in improving routes so \nthat the economics become increasingly competitive are of note. Some examples of \nindustrial applications have been given. Background rheology has been summarised \nso that efforts to obtain experimental parameters for modelling can be understood. \nThe variety of models has been discussed and future challenges identified. Finally the \nrange of alloys which are currently semi-solid processed is described. There are \nchallenges in widening the range of applicability but significant progress has been \nmade. The technology is gaining increasing industrial application. \n \nAcknowledgements  \nThe author would like to acknowledge her co-workers over 20 years of working in \nthis area, particularly A. R.
