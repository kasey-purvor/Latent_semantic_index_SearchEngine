These evidences become even stronger when the SNO data are combined\nwith the data obtained in the other solar neutrino experiments, Homestake, Kamiokande, SAGE,\nGALLEX\/GNO and Super-Kamiokande [4, 5]. As the two-neutrino oscillation analyzes of the\nsolar neutrino data show (see, e.g., [1]), the latter favor the large mixing angle (LMA) MSW\n\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u00b5(\u03c4) transition solution with \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\n\u22125 eV2 and tan2 \u03b8\u2299 \u223c 0.33, tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 < 1,\nwhere \u2206m2\u2299 and \u03b8\u2299 are the neutrino mass squared difference and mixing angle which control the\nsolar neutrino transitions. Strong evidences for oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos have been\nobtained in the Super-Kamiokande experiment [6]. The atmospheric neutrino data, as is well\nknown, is best described in terms of dominant \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 (\u03bd\u00af\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u00af\u03c4 ) oscillations with |\u2206m\n2\natm| \u223c\n(2.5\u2212 3.0) \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2.\nThe explanation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data in terms of neutrino oscillations\nrequires the existence of 3-neutrino mixing in the weak charged lepton current (see, e.g., [7, 8]):\n\u03bdlL =\n3\u2211\nj=1\nUlj \u03bdjL . (1)\nHere \u03bdlL, l = e, \u00b5, \u03c4 , are the three left-handed flavor neutrino fields, \u03bdjL is the left-handed field\nof the neutrino \u03bdj having a mass mj and U is the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)\nneutrino mixing matrix [9, 10]. If the neutrinos with definite mass \u03bdj are Majorana particles, the\nprocess of neutrinoless double-beta ((\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -) decay, (A,Z) \u2192 (A,Z + 2) + e\n\u2212 + e\u2212, (A,Z) and\n(A,Z + 2) being initial and final state nuclei, will be allowed (for reviews see, e.g., [11, 12]). For\nMajorana neutrinos \u03bdj with masses not exceeding few MeV, the dependence of the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay\namplitude on the neutrino mass and mixing parameters is confined to one factor \u2014 the effective\nMajorana mass |<m>|, which can be written in the form (see, e.g., [11]):\n|<m>| =\n\u2223\u2223m1|Ue1|2 +m2|Ue2|2 ei\u03b121 +m3|Ue3|2 ei\u03b131 \u2223\u2223 (2)\nwhere \u03b121 and \u03b131 are the two Majorana CP-violating phases\n2 [13, 14]. If CP-invariance holds,\none has [15, 16] \u03b121 = kpi, \u03b131 = k\n\u2032pi, where k, k\u2032 = 0, 1, 2, .... In this case\n\u03b721 \u2261 e\ni\u03b121 = \u00b11, \u03b731 \u2261 e\ni\u03b131 = \u00b11, (3)\nrepresent the relative CP-parities of the neutrinos \u03bd1 and \u03bd2, and \u03bd1 and \u03bd3, respectively.\nOne can express [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] the masses m2 and m3 entering into eq. (2) for |<m>| in\nterms of \u2206m2\u2299 and \u2206m\n2\natm, measured in the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments, and m1,\nwhile |Uej |\n2, j = 1, 2, 3, are related to the mixing angle which controls the solar \u03bde transitions \u03b8\u2299,\nand to the lepton mixing parameter sin2 \u03b8 limited by the data from the CHOOZ and Palo Verde\nexperiments [22, 23]. Within the convention m1 < m2 < m3 we are going to use in what follows, one\nhas \u2206m2atm \u2261 \u2206m\n2\n31, where \u2206m\n2\njk \u2261 m\n2\nj \u2212m\n2\nk, and m3 =\n\u221a\nm21 +\u2206m\n2\natm. For \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 there are two\npossibilities, \u2206m2\u2299 \u2261 \u2206m\n2\n21 and \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 \u2261 \u2206m\n2\n32, corresponding respectively to two different types of\nneutrino mass spectrum \u2014 with normal and with inverted hierarchy. In the first case one has m2 =\u221a\nm21 +\u2206m\n2\n\u2299, |Ue1|\n2 = cos2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212|Ue3|\n2), |Ue2|\n2 = sin2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212|Ue3|\n2), and |Ue3|\n2 \u2261 sin2 \u03b8, while in\nthe second m2 =\n\u221a\nm21 +\u2206m\n2\natm \u2212\u2206m\n2\n\u2299, |Ue2|\n2 = cos2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212 |Ue1|\n2), |Ue3|\n2 = sin2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212 |Ue1|\n2),\nand |Ue1|\n2 \u2261 sin2 \u03b8. Thus, given \u2206m2\u2299, \u2206m\n2\natm, \u03b8\u2299 and sin\n2 \u03b8, |<m>| depends, in general, on\n2We assume that mj > 0 and that the fields of the Majorana neutrinos \u03bdj satisfy the Majorana condition:\nC(\u03bd\u00afj)\nT = \u03bdj , j = 1, 2, 3, where C is the charge conjugation matrix.\n2\nthe lightest neutrino mass m1, on the two Majorana CP-violating phases \u03b121 and \u03b131 and on\nthe \u201cdiscrete ambiguity\u201d related to the two possible types of neutrino mass spectrum. In the\ncase of quasi-degenerate (QD) neutrino mass spectrum, m1 \u223c= m2 \u223c= m3, m\n2\n1 \u226b \u2206m\n2\natm,\u2206m\n2\n\u2299,\n|<m>| essentially does not depend on \u2206m2atm and \u2206m\n2\n\u2299, and the two possibilities, \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 \u2261 \u2206m\n2\n21\nand \u2206m2\u2299 \u2261 \u2206m\n2\n32, lead to the same predictions for\n3 |<m>|.\nThe observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay will have fundamental implications for our understanding of\nthe elementary particle interactions. It would imply, in particular, that the electron lepton charge\nLe and the total lepton charge L are not conserved and can change by two units in the latter, and\nwould suggest that the massive neutrinos are Majorana particles. Under the general and plausible\nassumptions of 3-\u03bd mixing and massive Majorana neutrinos, (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay generated only by the\n(V-A) charged current weak interaction via the exchange of the three Majorana neutrinos, and\nneutrino oscillation explanation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino data, which will be assumed\nto hold throughout this study, the observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay\n4 can give unique information on the\ntype of the neutrino mass spectrum and on the lightest neutrino mass, i.e., on the absolute scale\nof neutrino masses [19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. One of the important implications of the\nlatest results of the solar neutrino experiments, notably of SNO, which show that tan2 \u03b8\u2299 < 1 and,\ne.g., cos 2\u03b8\u2299 >\u223c 0.26 at 99.73% C.L. [1], regard the predictions for |<m>|. The fact that cos 2\u03b8\u2299\nis significantly different from zero leads to [30] (see also [20, 28, 29]) the existence of significant\nlower bounds on |<m>| (exceeding 0.01 eV) in the cases of neutrino mass spectrum with inverted\nhierarchy (IH) and of the quasi-degenerate (QD) type, and of a stringent upper bound (smaller\nthan 0.01 eV) if the neutrino mass spectrum is with normal hierarchy (NH). Using, e.g., the best fit\nvalues of \u2206m2\u2299, \u2206m\n2\natm, cos 2\u03b8\u2299 and sin\n2 \u03b8, obtained in the analyzes of the solar and atmospheric\nneutrino, and CHOOZ data in [1, 33], one finds respectively for the three types of spectra [30]:\n|<m>| >\u223c 2.8 \u00d7 10\n\u22122 eV (IH), |<m>| >\u223c 0.06 eV (QD) and |<m>| <\u223c 2.0 \u00d7 10\n\u22123 eV (NH). At\n90% C.L. the indicated lower and upper bounds read, respectively: |<m>| >\u223c 1.5 \u00d7 10\n\u22122 eV (IH),\n|<m>| >\u223c 0.25 eV (QD) and |<m>| <\u223c 6.0 \u00d7 10\n\u22123 eV (NH). The quoted lower bounds are in the\nrange of the sensitivity of currently operating and planned (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments (see further).\nThese results imply, in particular, that a measured value of |<m>| 6= 0 (or an experimental upper\nlimit on |<m>|) of the order of few\u00d710\u22122 eV can provide unique constraints on, or even can allow\none to determine, the type of the neutrino mass spectrum in the case the massive neutrinos are\nMajorana particles; it can provide also a significant upper limit on the mass of the lightest neutrino\nm1 [28, 29, 30]. Information on absolute values of neutrino masses in the range of interest can also\nbe obtained in the 3H \u03b2-decay neutrino mass experiment KATRIN [34] and from cosmological and\nastrophysical data (see, e.g., refs. [32, 35]).\nRather stringent upper bounds on |<m>| have been obtained in the 76Ge experiments by the\nHeidelberg-Moscow collaboration [36], |<m>| < 0.35 eV (90% C.L.), and by the IGEX collabora-\ntion [37], |<m>| < (0.33 \u00f7 1.35) eV (90% C.L.). Taking into account a factor of 3 uncertainty in\nthe calculated value of the corresponding nuclear matrix element, we get for the upper limit found\nin [36]: |<m>| < 1.05 eV. Considerably higher sensitivity to the value of |<m>| is planned to be\nreached in several (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments of a new generation. The NEMO3 experiment [38],\nwhich began to take data in July of 2002, and the cryogenics detector CUORICINO [39] to be op-\nerative in the second half of 2002, are expected to reach a sensitivity to values of |<m>| \u223c 0.2 eV.\nUp to an order of magnitude better sensitivity, i.e., to |<m>| \u223c= 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV, 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV,\n5.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV, 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV and 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV is planned to be achieved in the CUORE [39],\nGENIUS [40], EXO [41], MAJORANA [42] and MOON [43] experiments 5, respectively.\n3This statement is valid as long as there are no independent constraints on the CP-violating phases \u03b121 and \u03b131\nwhich enter into the expression for |<m>|.\n4Evidences for (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay taking place with a rate corresponding to 0.11 eV \u2264 |<m>| \u2264 0.56 eV (95% C.L.)\nare claimed to have been obtained in [24]. The results announced in [24] have been criticized in [25].\n5The quoted sensitivities correspond to values of the relevant nuclear matrix elements taken from ref. [44].\n3\nIn what regards the 3H \u03b2-decay experiments, the currently existing most stringent upper bounds\non the electron (anti-)neutrino mass m\u03bd\u00afe were obtained in the Troitzk [45] and Mainz [46] exper-\niments and read m\u03bd\u00afe < 2.2 eV. The KATRIN\n3H \u03b2-decay experiment [34] is planned to reach a\nsensitivity to m\u03bd\u00afe \u223c 0.35 eV.\nIn the present article we discuss the possibility of establishing the existence of CP-violation in\nthe lepton sector due to the Majorana CP-violating phases by measuring |<m>|. The fundamental\nproblem of CP-violation in the lepton sector is one of the most challenging future frontiers in the\nstudies of neutrino mixing. It was noticed in [18] (see also [19]) that in the case of a large mixing\nangle solution of the solar neutrino problem, the observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay combined with data on\nthe neutrino masses from 3H \u03b2-decay experiments could provide, in principle, unique information\non the CP-violation due to the Majorana CP-violating phases. As a more detailed study showed\n[20], information on the CP-violation of interest, and if CP-invariance holds \u2014 on the relative\nCP-parities of the massive Majorana neutrinos, could be obtained as well from a measurement of\n|<m>| supplemented by information on the type of the neutrino mass spectrum (or the lightest\nneutrino massm1). The problem of interest was studied in detail for the QD neutrino mass spectrum\n(taking into account the relevant nuclear matrix element uncertainties) in [26]. Further analysis 6\nshowed [28] that a measurement of |<m>| alone could exclude the possibility of both Majorana\nCP-violating phases \u03b121 and \u03b131 being equal to zero. However, such a measurement cannot rule out\nwithout additional input that the two phases take different CP-conserving values. The additional\ninput needed for establishing CP-violation could be, e.g., the measurement of neutrino mass m\u03bd\u00afe\nin 3H \u03b2-decay experiment KATRIN [34], or the cosmological determination of the sum of the three\nneutrino masses [35], \u03a3 = m1 +m2 +m3, or a derivation of a sufficiently stringent upper limit on\nm1 (or \u03a3). It was also pointed out in [28] that the possibility of finding CP-violation \u201crequires\nquite accurate measurements\u201d of |<m>| and, say, of m\u03bd\u00afe , \u201cand holds only for a limited range of\nvalues of the relevant parameters\u201d. The aim of the present paper is to quantify these requirements,\nand to better determine the ranges of values of the parameters in question, which could allow to\ndetect CP-violation due to the Majorana CP-violating phases. We discuss also the requirement the\npossibility of establishing CP-violation imposes on the uncertainty in the values of the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay\nnuclear matrix elements. Let us add that at present no viable alternative to the measurement of\n|<m>| for getting information about the Majorana CP-violating phases \u03b121 and \u03b131 exists (see,\ne.g., [49]), or can be foreseen to exist in the next \u223c 8 years.\nThe problem of detecting CP-violation associated with Majorana neutrinos by measuring |<m>|\nand m\u03bd\u00afe (or \u03a3) was discussed recently also in ref. [48]. The authors of [48], after making a certain\nnumber of assumptions about the experimental and theoretical developments in the field of interest\nthat might occur by 2020 7, claim to have shown \u201conce and for all that it is impossible to detect\nCP-violation from (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay in the foreseeable future.\u201d We have strong doubts that it is possible\nto foresee with certainty all the scientific and technological developments relevant to the problem\nof interest, which will take place in the next \u223c (10 \u2212 18) years. Correspondingly, the approach\nwe follow in the present work is \u201corthogonal\u201d to that adopted in [48]: here we make an attempt\nto determine the conditions under which CP-violation might be detected from a measurement of\n|<m>| and m\u03bd\u00afe (or \u03a3), or of |<m>| and a sufficiently stringent upper limit on m1 or \u03a3.\n2 The Neutrino Mass and Oscillation Data and the Predictions\nfor the Effective Majorana Mass |<m>|\nAs we have seen, the predicted value of |<m>| depends in the case of 3-neutrino mixing of\ninterest on: i) the value of the lightest neutrino mass m1, ii) \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 and \u03b8\u2299, iii) \u2206m\n2\natm, and iv) the\nlepton mixing angle \u03b8 which is limited by the CHOOZ and Palo Verde experiments [22, 23]. Given\n6Aspects of the phenomenology of the effects of CP-violation in (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay were discussed also, e.g., in [47].\n7It is supposed in [48], in particular, that |<m>| will be measured with a 25% (1 s.d.) error and that the\nuncertainty in the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay nuclear matrix elements will be reduced to a factor of 2.\n4\nthe indicated parameters, the value of |<m>| depends strongly on the type of the neutrino mass\nspectrum, as well as on the values of the two Majorana CP-violating phases, \u03b121 and \u03b131 (see eq.\n(2)), present in the lepton mixing matrix.\nThe possibility of detecting of CP-violation due to the Majorana CP-violating phases \u03b121 and\n\u03b131 if |<m>| is found to be nonzero in the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments of the next generation,\ndepends crucially on the precision with which m1 (or \u03a3), \u2206m\n2\n\u2299, \u03b8\u2299, \u2206m\n2\natm, sin\n2 \u03b8 and |<m>| will\nbe measured. It depends also crucially, as we shall see, on the values of m1 or \u03a3, of \u03b8\u2299 and\nof |<m>|. Actually, the accuracy of measurement of |<m>| in the next generation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -\ndecay experiments, given their sensitivity limits of \u223c (1.5\u22125.0)\u00d710\u22122 eV, depends on the value of\n|<m>|. If only an upper limit on m1 will be obtained, the possibility we are discussing will depend\non how stringent this upper limit is. In what regards the dependence of |<m>| on the type of the\nneutrino mass spectrum (normal versus inverted hierarchy), if the latter will not be determined in\nneutrino oscillation experiments (see, e.g., [50, 51]), the measurement of |<m>| 6= 0 itself in the\nnext generation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments could provide this information through the value of\n|<m>| found [30].\nThe value ofm1 can be measured by the KATRIN experiment [34] if the neutrino mass spectrum\nis of the QD type. In this case m1 \u223c= m2 \u223c= m3 \u223c= m\u03bd\u00afe . Given the currently allowed regions of\nvalues of \u2206m2\u2299 and \u2206m\n2\natm (see further), we have QD spectrum for m1,2,3\n\u223c= m\u03bd\u00afe > 0.20 eV. The\nKATRIN detector is designed to have a 1 s.d. error of 0.08 eV2 on a measured value of m2\u03bd\u00afe . The\nmost stringent upper limit on m\u03bd\u00afe\n\u223c= m1, which can be reached in this experiment, is 0.35 eV. The\nKATRIN experiment is expected to start in 2007.\nThe sum of neutrino masses \u03a3 can be determined by using data on the weak lensing of galaxies\nby large scale structure, and data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the MAP\nand PLANCK experiments, with an estimated (1 s.d.) error of 0.04 eV [35]. The latter represents\nthe estimated best precision that can possibly be achieved in the cosmological determination of \u03a3.\nIf only an upper limit of \u223c (0.10 \u2212 0.15) eV on \u03a3 will be obtained, that would strongly disfavor\n(if not rule out) the QD spectrum, while a measured value of |<m>| >\u223c 0.03 eV would rule out\nthe NH spectrum [30]. Given \u2206m2\u2299 and \u2206m\n2\natm, the indicated upper limit on \u03a3 could be used to\nderive a rather stringent upper limit on m1: using \u03a3 < 0.15 (0.12) eV and the current best fit\nvalues of \u2206m2\u2299\n\u223c= 5.0\u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 and \u2206m2atm\n\u223c= 3.0\u00d7 10\u22123 eV2, we get in the case of IH spectrum:\nm1 < 0.03 (0.01) eV. An upper limit on m1 of the order of (0.010 \u2013 0.025) eV might be of crucial\nimportance for establishing CP-violation due to the Majorana CP-violating phases [20, 28, 29].\nThe analysis of the solar neutrino data [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], including the latest SNO results, in terms of\nthe hypothesis of \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u00b5(\u03c4) oscillations\/transitions of the solar \u03bde shows [1] (see also, e.g., [52, 53])\nthat the data favor the LMA MSW solution with \u2206m2\u2299 > 0 and tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 < 1. The LOW solution of\nthe solar neutrino problem with transitions into active neutrinos is only allowed at approximately\n99.73% C.L. [1]; there do not exist other solutions at the indicated confidence level. In the case of\nthe LMA solution, the range of values of \u2206m2\u2299 found in [1] at 99.73% C.L. reads:\nLMA MSW : 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 <\u223c \u2206m\n2\n\u2299\n<\u223c 2.0 \u00d7 10\n\u22124 eV2 (99.73% C.L.). (4)\nThe best fit value of \u2206m2\u2299 obtained in [1] is (\u2206m\n2\n\u2299)BF = 5.0\u00d7 10\n\u22125 eV2. The mixing angle \u03b8\u2299 was\nfound in the case of the LMA solution to lie in an interval which at 99.73% C.L. is given by [1]\nLMA MSW : 0.26 <\u223c cos 2\u03b8\u2299 <\u223c 0.64 (99.73% C.L.). (5)\nThe best fit value of cos 2\u03b8\u2299 in the LMA solution region is given by (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)BF = 0.50.\nSimilar results have been obtained, e.g., in [52, 53]; in particular, the minimal allowed values\nof cos 2\u03b8\u2299 in the LMA solution region found in [1] and in [52] at 99.73% C.L. practically coincide.\nThe minimal allowed value of cos 2\u03b8\u2299 obtained in [53] at 99.73% C.L. is 0.10. The best fit values of\ncos 2\u03b8\u2299 found in [1, 52, 53] coincide, while that of \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 obtained in [53], (\u2206m\n2\n\u2299)BF\n\u223c= 5.5\u00d710\u22125 eV2\nis only slightly larger than the value found in [1, 52].\n5\nIn the two-neutrino \u03bd\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 (\u03bd\u00af\u00b5 \u2192 \u03bd\u00af\u03c4 ) oscillation analysis of the atmospheric neutrino data\nperformed in [6] the following best fit value of \u2206m2atm was obtained: (\u2206m\n2\natm)BF\n\u223c= 2.5\u00d7 10\u22123 eV2.\nAt 99.73% C.L. \u2206m2atm was found to lie in the interval: (1.5 \u2212 5.0) \u00d7 10\n\u22123 eV2.\nA 3-\u03bd oscillation analysis of the CHOOZ data showed [54], e.g., that for \u2206m2\u2299 <\u223c 10\n\u22124 eV2, the\nlimits on sin2 \u03b8 practically coincide with those derived in the 2-\u03bd oscillation analysis in ref. [22].\nCombined 3-\u03bd oscillation analyzes of the solar neutrino, Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino\nand CHOOZ data were performed in [33, 55] under the assumption of \u2206m2\u2299 \u226a \u2206m\n2\natm (see, e.g.,\n[7, 8, 56]). For the best fit values of \u2206m2atm and sin\n2 \u03b8 the authors of [33] and [55] obtained,\n(\u2206m2atm)BF\n\u223c= 3.1\u00d710\u22123 eV2, (sin2 \u03b8)BF \u223c= 0.005, and (\u2206m\n2\natm)BF\n\u223c= 2.7\u00d710\u22123 eV2, (sin2 \u03b8)BF \u223c= 0,\nrespectively. It was found in [55], in particular, that sin2 \u03b8 < 0.05 at 99.73% C.L.\nIf \u2206m2\u2299\n\u223c= (2.5\u2212 10.0)\u00d7 10\u22125 eV2, which is favored by the solar neutrino data, the KamLAND\nexperiment taking data at present will be able to measure \u2206m2\u2299 with an 1 s.d. error of \u223c (3\u2212 5)%\n(see, e.g., refs. [57] and [55, 58] and the articles quoted therein). Combining the data from the\nsolar neutrino experiments and from KamLAND would permit to determine tan2 \u03b8\u2299 with a high\nprecision as well: the estimated (1 s.d.) error on tan2 \u03b8\u2299 is\n8 \u223c 5% [57].\nSimilarly, if \u2206m2atm lies in the interval \u2206m\n2\natm\n\u223c= (2.0 \u2212 5.0) \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2, as is suggested by\nthe current atmospheric neutrino data [6], its value will be determined with a \u223c 10% error (1\ns.d.) by the MINOS experiment [59] which is scheduled to start in December of 2004. Somewhat\nbetter limits on sin2 \u03b8 than the existing one can be obtained in the MINOS experiment [59] as well.\nVarious options are being currently discussed (experiments with off-axis neutrino beams, more\nprecise reactor antineutrino and long base-line experiments, etc., see, e.g., [61]) of how to improve\nby at least an order of magnitude, i.e., to values of \u223c 0.005 or smaller, the sensitivity to sin2 \u03b8.\nAll the indicated developments are expected to take place within the next \u223c (7\u2212 8) years, i.e.,\nby 2010. We will assume in what follows that the problem of measuring or tightly constraining\nsin2 \u03b8 will also be resolved within the indicated period. We will also assume that by 2010 one\nor more (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments of the next generation will be operative, and that at least the\nphysical range of variation of the values of the relevant (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay nuclear matrix elements will\nbe unambiguously determined. Since all discussed future experiments (except the 10 ton version\nof GENIUS [40]) have a sensitivity to |<m>| > 0.01 eV, while in the case of NH neutrino mass\nspectrum |<m>| is predicted to be smaller than 0.01 eV, we will not consider the possibility of\nfinding CP-violation for the NH spectrum (for a discussion of this possibility see, e.g., [28, 29]).\nWe begin with a general analysis the aim of which is to determine what is the maximal uncer-\ntainty in the value of |<m>| due to the imprecise knowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix\nelements, which might still allow one to find CP-violation associated with Majorana neutrinos.\nThis is followed by results on the problem of finding the CP-violation of interest, derived by a\nsimplified error analysis of prospective input data on m\u03bd\u00afe or \u03a3, tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299, |<m>|, etc. The effects of\nthe nuclear matrix element uncertainty on the results of the statistical analysis are also considered.\n3 Finding CP-Violation Associated with Majorana Neutrinos\n3.1 General Constraints on the Nuclear Matrix Element Uncertainty\n3.1.1 Inverted Neutrino Mass Hierarchy: \u2206m2\u2299 \u2261 \u2206m\n2\n32 , m1 < 0.02 eV\nIf \u2206m2\u2299 = \u2206m\n2\n32, one has [19, 20]:\n|<m>| =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223m1|Ue1|2 +\u221am21 +\u2206m2atm\u2212\u2206m2\u2299 cos2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212 |Ue1|2)ei\u03b121\n+\n\u221a\nm21 +\u2206m\n2\natm sin\n2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212 |Ue1|\n2)ei\u03b131\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 (6)\n\u2243\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u221a\u2206m2atm( cos2 \u03b8\u2299 + sin2 \u03b8\u2299ei\u03b132)\u2223\u2223\u2223 =\u221a\u2206m2atm\u221a1\u2212 sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 sin2 \u03b1322 , (7)\n8We thank C. Pen\u02dca-Garay for clarifications on this point.\n6\nwhere \u03b132 = \u03b131 \u2212 \u03b121. In eq. (7) we have neglected \u2206m\n2\n\u2299 and m\n2\n1 with respect to \u2206m\n2\natm as well\nas the terms proportional to |Ue1|\n2 which is limited by the CHOOZ data. For the best fit value of\n\u2206m2atm\n\u223c= 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2, m1 < 0.01 eV and the best fit value of \u2206m\n2\n\u2299\n\u223c= (5.0 \u2212 5.5) \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2,\nthe corrections due to the \u2206m2\u2299 and m\n2\n1 do not exceed 1%. The same conclusion is valid for the\ncorrections due to the terms \u223c |Ue1|\n2 as long as |Ue1|\n2 <\u223c 0.01. For, e.g, \u2206m\n2\n\u2299\n\u223c= 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV2,\n|Ue1|\n2 \u223c= 0.04 andm1 \u223c= 0.02 eV, the corrections due to the terms neglected in eq. (7) can reach \u223c(5-\n6)%. These terms, obviously, should be taken into account if they turn out to have the indicated (or\nlarger) values and |<m>| is measured with a comparable to the corrections, or somewhat larger,\nexperimental error. In the latter case it will be necessary to use the exact formula for |<m>|,\neq. (6), in order not to introduce avoidable sources of uncertainties. We are interested here only i)\nin analyzing the impact for the searches of CP-violation associated with the Majorana CP-violating\nphases of the uncertainty in |<m>|, caused by the uncertainty in the evaluation of the relevant\n(\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay nuclear matrix elements, and ii) in deriving limits on the nuclear matrix element\nuncertainty, which, if satisfied, could permit one to draw conclusions concerning the CP-violation\nof interest. Therefore in what follows we will use the approximate expression for |<m>|, eq. (7),\nbut our results can be easily generalized using the exact formula, eq. (6).\nA positive signal for (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay in the future experiments with\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN \u2264\n|<m>| \u2264\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX , where (\u2206m\n2\natm)MIN , (\u2206m\n2\natm)MAX and (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN are determined from\nthe experimentally measured values taking a given C.L. interval, combined with an upper bound on\nm1, m1 < 0.02 eV, would lead to the conclusion that the neutrino mass spectrum is of the IH type.\nA \u201cjust-CP-violating\u201d region [20] \u2014 a value of |<m>| in this region would signal unambiguously\nCP-violation in the lepton sector due to Majorana CP-violating phases, would be present if\n(|<m>|exp)MAX <\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN (8)\n(|<m>|exp)MIN >\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX , (9)\nwhere (|<m>|exp)MAX(MIN) is the largest (smallest) experimentally allowed value of |<m>|, taking\ninto account both the experimental error on the measured (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay half life-time and the\nuncertainty due to the evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements. Condition (9) depends crucially\non the value of (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX and it is less stringent for smaller values of (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX [28].\nWe can parametrize the uncertainty in |<m>| due to the poor knowledge of the relevant nuclear\nmatrix elements \u2014 we will use the term \u201ctheoretical uncertainty\u201d for the latter, through a parameter\n\u03b6, \u03b6 \u2265 1, defined as:\n|<m>| = \u03b6\n(\n(|<m>|exp)MIN \u00b1\u2206\n)\n(10)\nwhere (|<m>|exp)MIN is the value of |<m>| obtained from the measured (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay half life-\ntime of a given nucleus using the largest nuclear matrix element and \u2206 is the experimental error.\nThe necessary condition permitting to establish, in principle, that the CP-symmetry is violated\ndue to the Majorana CP-violating phases is:\n1 \u2264 \u03b6 <\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX + 2\u2206\n. (11)\nObviously, the smaller (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX and \u2206 the larger the \u201ctheoretical uncertainty\u201d which might\nallow one to make conclusions concerning the CP-violation of interest.\nFrom here on, for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the \u201ctheoretical uncertainty\u201d dominates\nover the experimental one and we neglect \u2206. If the computation of the nuclear matrix elements\nbecomes sufficiently accurate and\/or if \u2206 is relatively large, it would be necessary to take into\naccount also the uncertainty due to the experimental error in the analysis which follows.\n7\nFor the best fit value of \u2206m2atm [33], (\u2206m\n2\natm)BF = 3.1 \u00d7 10\n\u22123 eV, taking (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)BF =\n0.5, 0.4, 0.3 and allowing for 10% (20%) uncertainty in the values of both parameters 9, condition\n(11) (with negligible \u2206) implies \u03b6 < 1.65, 2.05, 2.73 (1.33, 1.67, 2.22), respectively.\nCondition (11) is obtained for the most favorable case in which the minimal allowed value\nof |<m>|, (|<m>|exp)MIN , is very close to the upper bound of the allowed range of values for\n|<m>| in the CP-conserving case and opposite CP-parities for the two relevant neutrinos, e.g.,\nfor (|<m>|exp)MIN =\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX . In the general case this condition might not\nbe satisfied. Let us parametrize the experimental value of |<m>|, (|<m>|exp)MIN , obtained using\nthe largest nuclear matrix element, as follows:\n(|<m>|exp)MIN = y\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN , y \u2265 1. (12)\nUsing eq. (10) we get:\n|<m>| = \u03b6y\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN . (13)\nThe requirement that |<m>| takes values in the region allowed in the case of neutrino mass\nspectrum with inverted hierarchy, translates into an interval of allowed values of y:\n1 \u2264 y \u2264\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN\n1\n(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN\n. (14)\nThe necessary conditions for establishing CP-violation due to the Majorana CP-violating phases,\neqs. (8) and (9), lead to the following constraints on the parameters y and \u03b6:\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN\n(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX\n(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN\n< y <\n1\n(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN\n(15)\n1 \u2264 \u03b6 <\n1\ny(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN\n. (16)\nThe necessary condition for CP- violation (11) (for negligible \u2206) can be obtained from eq. (16) by\ntaking y =\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX\/(\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN).\nIn order to exclude the case of CP-conservation and equal CP-parities of the two relevant\nneutrinos \u03bd2 and \u03bd3, the following relation has to be satisfied:\n(|<m>|)\nMAX\n<\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN , (17)\nor, in terms of the parameters y and \u03b6,\n\u03b6y <\n1\n(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN\n. (18)\nFor (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN = 0.40 (0.30) and y = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, \u03b6 needs to satisfy \u03b6 < 2.2, 1.8, 1.2 (3.3, 2.2, 1.67).\nThe case of CP-conservation with \u03bd2 and \u03bd3 having opposite CP-parities, \u03b721 = \u2212\u03b731 = \u00b11, can\nbe excluded if\n(|<m>|)\nMIN\n>\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX , (19)\nor, equivalently\ny >\n\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MAX (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX\u221a\n(\u2206m2atm)MIN (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN\n. (20)\n9In order for \u2206 to be negligible in eq. (11) for \u2206m2atm = 3.1\u00d710\n\u22123 eV, cos 2\u03b8\u2299 = 0.4 and an experimental error of\n20% on both these parameters, one must have \u2206\u226a 0.01 eV. Such a precision in the measurement of |<m>| cannot be\nachieved in the planned next generation (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments, except possibly in the 10 ton version of GENIUS.\nSufficiently small values of \u2206 can be achieved in practically all (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments of the next generation if\n|<m>| >\u223c 0.20 eV.\n8\nFor an uncertainty of 10% in the values of \u2206m2atm and cos 2\u03b8\u2299, this inequality reads y > 1.34.\nIf the neutrino mass spectrum is of the inverted hierarchy type, a sufficiently precise determi-\nnation of \u2206m2atm, \u03b8\u2299 and |Ue1|\n2 (or a better upper limit on |Ue1|\n2), combined with a measurement\nof |<m>| in the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments, could allow one to get information on the difference of\nthe Majorana CP-violating phases (\u03b131\u2212\u03b121) [18]. The value of sin\n2(\u03b131\u2212\u03b121)\/2 is related to the\nexperimentally measurable quantities as follows [18, 19, 20]:\nsin2\n\u03b131\u2212\u03b121\n2\n\u2243\n(\n1\u2212\n|<m>|2\n(\u2206m2atm +m\n2\n1)(1\u2212 |Ue1|\n2)2\n) 1\nsin2 2\u03b8\u2299\n\u2243\n(\n1\u2212\n|<m>|2\n\u2206m2atm\n) 1\nsin2 2\u03b8\u2299\n, (21)\nwhere in writing the second simplified expression we have assumed that |Ue1|\n2 <\u223c 0.01 and m1 <\u223c\n0.01 eV. The constraints on sin2(\u03b131 \u2212 \u03b121)\/2 6= 0, 1, which correspond to CP-violation, are\nequivalent to eqs. (8) and (9). Given the fact that the atmospheric neutrino data implies\n\u221a\n\u2206m2atm >\u223c\n0.04 eV, obtaining, e.g., an experimental upper limit on |<m>| of the order of 0.03 eV would\npermit, in particular, to get [30] a lower bound on the value of sin2(\u03b131 \u2212 \u03b121)\/2 and possibly\nexclude the CP-conserving case corresponding to \u03b131 \u2212 \u03b121 = 0 (i.e., \u03b721 = \u03b731 = \u00b11). Note that\none of the two CP-violating phases, \u03b121 or \u03b131, will not be constrained in the case under discussion.\nThus, even if it is found that \u03b131 \u2212 \u03b121 = 0,\u00b1pi, at least one of the phases \u03b121 and \u03b131 can be a\nsource of CP-violation in \u2206L = 2 processes other than (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay. Let us note also that in the\nlimit of negligible (zero) |Ue1|\n2 and m1, there is practically only one physical CP-violating phase in\nthe lepton sector in the case under discussion - the Majorana CP-violating phase \u03b132 = \u03b131\u2212\u03b121.\n3.1.2 Quasi-Degenerate Mass Spectrum (m1 > 0.2 eV, m1 \u2243 m2 \u2243 m3 \u2243 m\u03bd\u00afe)\nFor the QD neutrino mass spectrum, the effective Majorana mass |<m>| is given in terms\nof m\u03bd\u00afe\n\u223c= m1,2,3, \u03b8\u2299 and |Ue3|\n2 which is constrained by the CHOOZ data, as follows (see, e.g.,\n[20, 26]):\n|<m>| = m\u03bd\u00afe\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 cos2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212 |Ue3|2) + sin2 \u03b8\u2299(1\u2212 |Ue3|2)ei\u03b121 + |Ue3|2ei\u03b131 \u2223\u2223\u2223 (22)\n\u2243 m\u03bd\u00afe\n\u2223\u2223\u2223 cos2 \u03b8\u2299 + sin2 \u03b8\u2299ei\u03b121 \u2223\u2223\u2223 = m\u03bd\u00afe\u221a1\u2212 sin2 2\u03b8\u2299 sin2 \u03b1212 . (23)\nIn eq. (23) we have neglected \u2206m2\u2299 and \u2206m\n2\natm since in the case under consideration m\n2\n1 \u226b\n\u2206m2atm \u226b \u2206m\n2\n\u2299. We have furthermore neglected |Ue3|\n2, which leads to an uncertainty on |<m>| not\nexceeding 2% if |Ue3|\n2 < 0.01. If |Ue3|\n2 turns out to have a value, e.g, close to its current upper\nlimit, |Ue3|\n2 \u223c= 0.04, the correction due to |Ue3|\n2 in |<m>| can be as large as O(8% \u00f7 12%) and\n|Ue3|\n2 should be kept in the expression for |<m>|.\nThe effective Majorana mass |<m>| in the case of QD spectrum is limited from below since\ncos 2\u03b8\u2299 > 0 and the inequality m\n2\n1 \u226b \u2206m\n2\natm implies m1\n\u223c= m\u03bd\u00afe> 0.2 eV. The lower limit on\n|<m>| is reached in the case of CP-conservation and \u03b721 = \u03b731 = \u22121. Using the best fit, the\n90% C.L. and the 99.73% C.L., allowed values, of cos 2\u03b8\u2299 from [1], we obtain [30], respectively,\n|<m>| >\u223c 0.10 eV, |<m>| >\u223c 0.06 eV and |<m>| >\u223c 0.035 eV.\nThe indicated values of |<m>| are in the range of sensitivity of some current (NEMO3, CUORI-\nCINO) and of most future (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments of the next generation. A measurement of\n|<m>|, |<m>| > 0.10 eV, would allow one to conclude that the neutrino mass spectrum is of\nthe QD type. If, however, |<m>| is found to lie in the interval 0.035 eV \u2264 |<m>| \u2264 0.10 eV,\none would need additional information to establish that the neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate.\nFor instance, the inequality m21\n\u223c= m\u03bd\u00afe\n2 \u226b \u2206m2atm, which for the current best fit value of \u2206m\n2\natm\ncorresponds to m1,m\u03bd\u00afe > 0.2 eV, should be fulfilled.\nFor the values of |<m>| in the range of sensitivity of the discussed current and future (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -\ndecay experiments, a \u201cjust-CP-violation\u201d region can exist. In order to establish whether CP-\nviolation due to the Majorana CP-violating phases takes place, the uncertainty on the measured\n9\nvalue of m\u03bd\u00afe should be sufficiently small. More specifically, the maximal value of |<m>| for the\nallowed range of values of m\u03bd\u00afe in the case of CP-conservation and \u03b721 = \u2212\u03b731 = \u22121 (see eq. (22))\nmust be smaller than the minimal value of |<m>| for the same range of m\u03bd\u00afe and \u03b721 = \u2212\u03b731 = 1.\nThis leads to the following constraint on the allowed range of (or twice the relative error on) m\u03bd\u00afe :\n(m\u03bd\u00afe)MAX \u2212 (m\u03bd\u00afe)MIN\n(m\u03bd\u00afe)MAX\n< 1\u2212 (1 + |Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n)(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX \u2212 |Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n, (24)\nwhere we have neglected the terms \u223c O(|Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n)2. Obviously, condition (24) is less constraining\nfor smaller values of (cos 2\u03b8)\nMAX\n.\nIf condition (24) is satisfied, the \u201cjust-CP-violation\u201d interval of values of |<m>| is given by:\n(|<m>|exp)MIN >\n(\n(cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX(1\u2212 |Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n) + |Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n)\n(m\u03bd\u00afe)MAX , (25)\n(|<m>|exp)MAX <\n(\n1\u2212 2|Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n)\n(m\u03bd\u00afe)MIN . (26)\nThe necessary condition for CP-violation, eq. (25), is strongly dependent on (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX : the\nsmaller the value of (cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX , the larger the \u201cjust-CP-violation\u201d region [28].\nAssuming that |Ue3|\n2 <\u223c 0.01, we can neglect |Ue3|\n2 in eqs. (25) and (26). Similarly to the case of\nIH neutrino mass spectrum, one can parametrize the uncertainty in the value of |<m>| associated\nwith the theoretical uncertainty in the value of the relevant nuclear matrix element(s) by introducing\ntwo real parameters, \u03b6 and y: \u03b6 is determined by eq. (10), while the definition of y in the case under\nstudy can formally be obtained from eq. (13) by replacing\n\u221a\n\u2206m2atm withm\u03bd\u00afe . The parametrization\nof |<m>|, the necessary conditions for CP-violation due to Majorana CP-violating phases, the\nconstraints on \u03b6 and y, etc., can formally be obtained from those derived for the case of IH neutrino\nmass spectrum in Subsection 3.1.1 by substituting\n\u221a\n\u2206m2atm with m\u03bd\u00afe , and we are not going to give\nthem here. Let us note only that, in general, the uncertainty in the measured value of m\u03bd\u00afe (or \u03a3) is\nexpected to be larger than that in \u2206m2atm of O(10%) we have assumed. Correspondingly, the former\nplays a more important role as limiting factor for the possibility of detecting the CP-violation under\ndiscussion (see Section 3.2).\nA rather precise determination of |<m>|, m1 \u223c= m\u03bd\u00afe , \u03b8\u2299 and |Ue3|\n2 would imply an interde-\npendent constraint on the two CP-violating phases \u03b121 and \u03b131 [20, 26] (see Fig. 16 in [20]). For\nm1 \u2261 m\u03bd\u00afe > 0.2 eV, the phase \u03b121 could be tightly constrained if |Ue3|\n2 is sufficiently small and\nthe term in |<m>| containing it can be neglected, as is suggested by the current limits on |Ue3|\n2:\nsin2\n\u03b121\n2\n\u2243\n(\n1\u2212\n|<m>|2\nm2\u03bd\u00afe\n) 1\nsin2 2\u03b8\u2299\n. (27)\nThe term which depends on the CP-violating phase \u03b131 in the expression for |<m>|, is suppressed\nby the factor |Ue3|\n2. Therefore the constraint one could possibly obtain on cos\u03b131 is trivial, unless\n|Ue3|\n2 \u223c O(sin2 \u03b8\u2299). The constraints sin\n2(\u03b121\/2) 6= 0, 1 implying CP-violation, are satisfied if the\nnecessary conditions for CP-violation, eqs. (25) and (26), hold.\nIf \u03b721 and \u03b731 take the CP-conserving values \u03b721 = \u00b1\u03b731 = \u22121, there are both an upper and a\nlower bounds on |<m>|,m\u03bd\u00afe((cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MIN(1\u2212|Ue3|\n2\nMIN\n)+|Ue3|\n2\nMIN\n) \u2264 |<m>| \u2264 m\u03bd\u00afe((cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX(1\u2212\n|Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n)+ |Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n), where we have used eq. (22). Given the range of allowed values of cos 2\u03b8\u2299, the\nobservation of the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay in the present and\/or future (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments, combined\nwith a sufficiently stringent upper limit on m\u03bd\u00afe \u2243 m1,2,3, m\u03bd\u00afe < |<m>|exp\/((cos 2\u03b8\u2299)MAX(1 \u2212\n|Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n)+ |Ue3|\n2\nMAX\n), would permit, e.g., to exclude the case of CP-conservation with \u03b721 = \u00b1\u03b731 =\n\u22121 [30].\n3.2 Example of Simplified Error Analysis\nIn this subsection we give an example of simplified error analysis of prospective data on m\u03bd\u00afe\nor \u03a3, tan2 \u03b8\u2299, |<m>|, etc., performed with the aim of establishing at a given C.L. that the phases\n10\n\u03b121 and\/or \u03b131, or \u03b132 = \u03b131 \u2212 \u03b121, take CP-violating values. For simplicity we use eq. (23) (eq.\n(7)), assuming that sin2 \u03b8 \u2261 |Ue3|\n2 (|Ue1|\n2) is sufficiently small, sin2 \u03b8 <\u223c 0.01. In this case we get\nfor the CP-violating phase of interest either eq. (27) (QD spectrum) or eq. (21) (IH spectrum).\nIn the analysis which follows we use the following 4 representative values of tan2 \u03b8\u2299 from the\nregion of the LMA solution: tan2 \u03b8\u2299 = 0.25; 0.40; 0.55; 0.70. The 1 s.d. error of the experimentally\nmeasured value of tan2 \u03b8\u2299 is assumed to be \u03c3(tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299)\/ tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 = 5%. Considering the case of\nQD neutrino mass spectrum, we take the following illustrative values of m20 \u2261 m\u03bd\u00afe\n2 \u223c= m21,2,3 (to\nbe measured in the 3H \u03b2-decay experiment KATRIN) and \u03a3 (which could be determined from\ncosmological and astrophysical data): m20 = (1.0)\n2; (0.70)2; (0.50)2 eV2 and \u03a3 = 3.0; 1.5; 0.60\neV, with m0 = \u03a3\/3. The error on the value of m\n2\n0 used in the analysis is \u03c3(m\n2\n0) = 0.08 eV\n2 [34],\nwhile that on the value of \u03a3 is assumed to be \u03c3(\u03a3) = 0.04 eV [35]. The latter implies for the QD\nspectrum that \u03c3(m0) = \u03c3(\u03a3)\/3 \u223c= 0.013 eV. We represent the error of the experimentally measured\nvalue of |<m>| in the standard form:\n\u03c3(|<m>|)\n|<m>|\n=\n\u221a\n(E1)2 + (E2)2 , (28)\nwhere E1 and E2 are the statistical and systematic errors. We choose E2 = const = 0.05.\nWe take E1 = f\/|<m>|, where we assume f = 0.028 eV. This gives a total relative error\n\u03c3(|<m>|)\/|<m>| \u223c= 15% at |<m>| = 0.20 eV. The above choices are motivated by the fact\nthat the sensitivities of the next generation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay experiments (CUORE, GENIUS,\nEXO, MAJORANA, MOON) in the measurement of |<m>| are estimated to be in the range\nof \u223c (1.5 \u2212 5.0) \u00d7 10\u22122 eV and if, e.g, |<m>| >\u223c 0.20 eV, a precision in the determination of\n|<m>| corresponding to an error of \u223c 15% could be reached in these experiments. Moreover,\nfor values of |<m>| which are sufficiently bigger than the quoted sensitivity limits of the future\nexperiments, the statistical error scales as |<m>| increases like E1 \u223c const\/|<m>|.\nThe measurement of |<m>| and m20 and the more accurate determination of tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 would\nallow one to determine sin2 \u03b1, where \u03b1 \u2261 \u03b121\/2 for the QD case, using eq. (27). Using error\nmultiplication, the error on sin2 \u03b1 is:\n\u03c3(sin2 \u03b1) =\n(1 + tan2 \u03b8\u2299)\n2\n4 tan2 \u03b8\u2299\n[\n4\n(\n|<m>|2\nm20\n)2 (\n\u03c3(|<m>|)\n|<m>|\n)2\n+\n(\n|<m>|2\nm20\n)2 (\n\u03c3(m20)\nm20\n)2\n+\n(\n1\u2212 tan2 \u03b8\u2299\n1 + tan2 \u03b8\u2299\n)2(\n1\u2212\n|<m>|2\nm20\n)2(\n\u03c3(tan2 \u03b8\u2299)\ntan2 \u03b8\u2299\n)2]1\/2\n. (29)\nIf the sum \u03a3 = 3m0 is cosmologically determined, one has \u03c3(\u03a3)\/\u03a3 = \u03c3(m0)\/m0 and the error on\nsin2 \u03b1 can be obtained from the above equation by using \u03c3(m20)\/m\n2\n0 = 2\u03c3(m0)\/m0.\nIn deriving eq. (29) we have assumed that there are no correlations between the errors on m20\n(or m0), tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 and |<m>|. Let us note that the first two terms in the expression for \u03c3(sin\n2 \u03b1)\nare suppressed for m20 \u226b |<m>|\n2, i.e., for \u03b1 \u223c pi\/2. The third is small for |<m>| \u2243 m0, i.e., for\n\u03b1 \u223c 0, pi, when the first two dominate, and\/or for tan2 \u03b8\u2299 \u2243 1. The common factor in eq. (29) is\nminimized for tan2 \u03b8\u2299 = 1.\nWith the help of eq. (29) one can study the dependence of the error of sin2 \u03b1 on the values\nof the neutrino mass and mixing parameters and their errors. Figures 1 and 2 show results for a\npossible determination of a neutrino mass from the tritium spectrum and cosmology, respectively.\nAs Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrate, establishing under the assumptions made that CP-violation takes\nplace, i.e., that sin2(\u03b121\/2) 6= 0, 1, at 99.73% C.L. requires typically tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 >\u223c 0.40, m\n2\n0\n>\u223c 0.70\n2 eV2,\nor \u03a3 >\u223c 1.0 eV. Further, the value of the CP-violating phase \u03b121 should lie approximately within\nthe intervals \u223c (pi\/2\u2212 3pi\/4) and \u223c (5pi\/4\u2212 3pi\/2). The larger the values of tan2 \u03b8\u2299, and\/or m\n2\n0 or\n\u03a3, the larger the interval of values of \u03b121 for which CP-violation could be established.\n11\nNext we include the effect of the uncertainty in the relevant (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay nuclear matrix el-\nements in the analysis by assuming that the value of |<m>| which enters into the expression\nfor \u03c3(sin2 \u03b1), eq. (29), is obtained from a measurement of the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay lifetime of given\nnucleus by using the maximal allowed value of the nuclear matrix element, i.e., that |<m>| =\n\u03b6\n(\n(|<m>|exp)MIN\n)\n, where \u03b6 \u2265 1 parametrizes the uncertainty under discussion (see subsection\n3.1.1). Figures 1 and 2 correspond then to \u03b6 = 1. In Figures 3 \u2013 6 we exhibit results for\n\u03b6 = 1.5; 2.0; 3.0, including in each sub-figure also the results for \u03b6 = 1. As Figs. 3 \u2013 6 show,\nit would be impossible to make a definite conclusion concerning the CP-violation for values of the\nparameters considered, m20 \u2261 m\n2\n\u03bd\u00afe = (0.5\n2\u22121.02) eV2, \u03a3 = (0.60\u22123.0) eV, tan2 \u03b8\u2299 = (0.25\u22120.70),\nif \u03b6 >\u223c 3. Actually, for tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299 \u223c 0.25, m\n2\n0 \u223c (0.8\n2 \u2212 1.02) eV2 or \u03a3 \u223c (1.5 \u2212 3.0) eV, one might\neven exclude the possibility of \u03b6 >\u223c 3 at 99.73% C.L. Establishing at 3\u03c3 that the phase \u03b121 takes a\nCP-violating value is possible provided \u03b6 < 2, tan2 \u03b8\u2299 >\u223c 0.55, m\n2\n0\n>\u223c 0.70\n2 eV2, or \u03a3 >\u223c 1.5 eV, and\nif \u03b121 \u223c (pi\/2\u2212 3pi\/4) or \u03b121 \u223c (5pi\/4\u2212 3pi\/2). The precise sub-intervals of values of \u03b121 for which\nCP-violation could be established depend of the precise values of tan2 \u03b8\u2299, m\n2\n0, or \u03a3. For \u03b6 = 2 this\nmight be done as well, but for a rather limited range of values of \u03b121 from the indicated intervals\nand if tan2 \u03b8\u2299 >\u223c 0.65, m\n2\n0\n>\u223c 0.80\n2 eV2, or \u03a3 >\u223c 2.0 eV. Obtaining an evidence for CP-violation at\n2\u03c3 level for a given \u03b6 <\u223c 2 is possible for wider ranges of values of \u03b121, tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299, m\n2\n0, or \u03a3, than those\npermitting a 3\u03c3 \u201cproof\u201d.\nSimilar results are valid for neutrino mass spectrum with inverted hierarchy. In this case the\nrole of m20 is played by \u2206m\n2\natm (see eq. (7)), which is expected to be measured with a relative error\nof \u223c 10%. Reaching a definite conclusion concerning the CP-violation, as the preceding discussion\nindicates, requires, in particular, |<m>| to be measured with an error not exceeding \u223c (15\u221220)%.\nOnce |<m>|, \u03b8\u2299 and m\u03bd\u00afe are measured in present and future experiments, constraints at a\ngiven C.L. on the allowed values of \u03b6 and sin2 \u03b121\/2 can be obtained performing a joined \u03c7\n2 analysis\nof the data on |<m>|, \u03b8\u2299 and m\u03bd\u00afe .\n4 Conclusions\nAssuming 3-\u03bd mixing and massive Majorana neutrinos, (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay generated only by the\n(V-A) charged current weak interaction via the exchange of the three Majorana neutrinos, LMA\nMSW solution of the \u03bd\u2299-problem and neutrino oscillation explanation of the atmospheric neutrino\ndata, we have discussed in the present article the possibility of detecting CP-violation in the lepton\nsector, associated with Majorana neutrinos, from a measurement of the effective Majorana mass in\n(\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay, |<m>|. The problem of detection of CP-violation in the lepton sector is one of the\nmost formidable and challenging problems in the studies of neutrino mixing. As was noticed in [28],\nthe measurement of |<m>| alone could exclude the possibility of the two Majorana CP-violating\nphases \u03b121 and \u03b131, present in the lepton mixing matrix in the case of interest, being equal to zero.\nHowever, such a measurement cannot rule out without additional input that the two phases take\ndifferent CP-conserving values. The additional input needed for establishing CP-violation could\nbe, e.g., the measurement of neutrino mass m\u03bd\u00afe in\n3H \u03b2-decay experiment KATRIN [34], or the\ncosmological determination of the sum of the three neutrino masses [35], \u03a3 = m1 +m2 +m3, or\na derivation of a sufficiently stringent upper limit on \u03a3 or on the lightest neutrino mass m1. At\npresent no viable alternative to the measurement of |<m>| for getting information on the Majorana\nCP-violating phases \u03b121 and \u03b131 exists, or can be foreseen to exist in the next \u223c 8 years. Thus, the\npresent work represents an attempt to determine the conditions under which CP-violation might\nbe detected from a measurement of |<m>| and of m\u03bd\u00afe (or \u03a3), or of |<m>| and by obtaining a\nsufficiently stringent upper limit on \u03a3 or m1.\nWe have discussed in detail the prospective data on the neutrino mass, mixing and oscillation\nparameters on which |<m>| depends: m\u03bd\u00afe , \u03a3, \u2206m\n2\natm, tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299, \u2206m\n2\n\u2299, |Ue3|\n2 or |Ue1|\n2. Consid-\nering neutrino mass spectrum with inverted hierarchy and of quasi-degenerate type, we performed\n12\na general analysis, the aim of which was to determine what is the maximal uncertainty in the\nvalue of |<m>| due to the imprecise knowledge of the corresponding (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd -decay nuclear matrix\nelements, which might still allow one to find CP-violation associated with Majorana neutrinos.\nThis was followed by an example of simplified error analysis of the possibility to establish that the\nphysical Majorana phases take CP-non-conserving values. The analysis is based on prospective\ninput data on |<m>|, m\u03bd\u00afe , \u03a3, tan\n2 \u03b8\u2299, etc. The effect of the nuclear matrix element uncertainty\nwas included in the analysis. The results thus obtained are illustrated in Figs. 1 \u2013 6.\nThe possibility of finding the CP-violation of interest requires quite accurate measurements\nof |<m>| and, say, of m\u03bd\u00afe or \u03a3, and holds only for a limited range of values of the relevant\nparameters. More specifically, proving that CP-violation associated with Majorana neutrinos takes\nplace requires, in particular, a relative experimental error on the measured value of |<m>| not\nbigger than (15 \u2013 20)%, a \u201ctheoretical uncertainty\u201d in the value of |<m>| due to an imprecise\nknowledge of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements smaller than a factor of 2, a value of\ntan2 \u03b8\u2299 >\u223c 0.55, and values of the relevant Majorana CP-violating phases (\u03b121, \u03b132) typically\nwithin the ranges of \u223c (pi\/2 \u2212 3pi\/4) and \u223c (5pi\/4 \u2212 3pi\/2).\nAcknowledgments.
