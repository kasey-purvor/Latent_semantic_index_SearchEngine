Interesting quantum phenomena such as Coulomb\nblockade1 and resonant tunneling \u0001RT\u0002 have been observed\nin FE. RT solid-state semiconductor devices have important\napplications in high frequency oscillators and mixers and in\nRT diodes.2 However, RT in FE has not been widely ob-\nserved. In 1996, Kryuchenko and Litovchenko3 performed a\ncomputer simulation of FE from multilayer cathodes, result-\ning in negative differential resistance caused by RT of elec-\ntrons through quantum well subbands. The same group later\nobserved experimentally RT in FE from similar multilayered\nstructures.4 Similarly, negative differential resistance has\nbeen observed in FE from amorphous carbon based\nmultilayer structures.5\nCarbon nanotubes \u0001CNTs\u0002 were first observed in 1952\nas an industrial contaminant6 and recognized in context in\n1991 as molecular microtubules of graphitic carbon.7 Their\nhigh strength,8 great length,9 and ability to be spun into\nfibers could lead to applications in materials science.10 They\nhave high electrical and thermal conductivity, making them\nideal candidates for use in electrical devices11,12 such as\nsensors.\n13,14 CNTs can be grown over large areas15 and at\nlow temperatures,16 making them perfect for large area ap-\nplications on temperature-sensitive substrates. Of interest in\nthis work are the FE properties of CNTs. A vast international\nbody of work has been published on their application in FE\ndisplays.17\u201320 CNTs can be solubilized by an acid oxidative\nchemical treatment, resulting in the formation of carboxylic\nacid groups attached to the CNT ends and sidewalls,21 which\nreadily interact with water molecules via hydrogen bonding.\nAcid treatment also purifies CNTs, dissolving catalytic par-\nticles and amorphous carbon.22 Solubilization opens the door\nto a variety of cost effective, scalable, room temperature\ndeposition techniques, such as spin-coating and ink-jet print-\ning; thus CNT inks can be deposited onto a plethora of dif-\nferent substrates. The excellent FE properties of CNT ink on\npaper substrates have recently been explored.23\nIn previous work by the authors, the surface of multiwall\nCNTs \u0001MWNTs\u0002 was chemically modified, resulting in a\nchange in work function24 and thereby a change in the FE\nproperties.25 Subsequently, close analysis of the FE charac-\nteristics of acid-oxidized MWNTs \u0001o-MWNTs\u0002 revealed un-\nexpected staircaselike increases in the current-field curves.\nHere, these atypical curves are analyzed, and the results are\ndiscussed in terms of RT through localized surface states.\nHigh purity, 10 nm diameter MWNTs were purchased\nfrom Nanocyl. Acid oxidization was performed as previously\ndescribed.25 Carbon fiber fabric \u0001Ballard\u0002 was used as a sub-\nstrate due to its high conductivity and good FE properties,\nand it was rendered hydrophilic via a 10 s oxygen plasma\nmicrowave treatment. This results in the formation of oxygen\ncontaining moieties,26 promoting wetting between the\no-MWNT ink and the carbon fiber. Hydrogen bonding is also\nexpected to provide strong adhesion between the carbon fiber\nand the o-MWNTs. After plasma treatment, the carbon fabric\nwas dip-coated in o-MWNT ink and then baked at 100 \u00b0C\nfor 20 min. FE characterization was conducted as previously\ndescribed.25\nFigures 1\u0001a\u0002\u20131\u0001d\u0002 show scanning electron microscope\n\u0001SEM\u0002 images of the samples.

The\nred line in each shows the averaged, smoothed data. The\nstandard deviation in emission current is around 25%, aver-\naged over the whole emitting range. The current curves and\nthe FN curves show staircaselike current-field characteristics,\nwhich are repeatable over the five successive voltage cycles.\nThe current rises in steps of around one order of magnitude\nwith a roughly constant step-width of \u00050.05 V \/\u0001m. These\nsteps are highlighted in the derivative plot \u0003Fig. 2\u0001c\u0002\u0004. Figure\n3 shows \u0001a\u0002 the FE and \u0001b\u0002 the FN characteristics for the\ndownward part of the five cycles. These curves also have an\natypical nonlinear shape. However, as opposed to the four\nregular steps of the upward part, these downward cycles have\njust two larger steps of unequal width.\nA probable source of this nonlinearity is RT through\nquantized subbands at the MWNT surface. Nonlinearity can\narise in the FE current due to resonance when the electronic\nsublevels in quantum wells are aligned and negative differ-\nential resistance when misaligned. Theoretical FN plots of\nFE from Si\u2013SiO2\u2013Si\u2013SiO2 cathodes have been attributed to\nRT \u0001Ref. 3\u0002 and are strikingly similar to our experimental\ndata, albeit with resonances at different field strengths. It is\npostulated that the nonlinearity in our experimental data is a\nresult of a similar RT effect, with differences in the quantum\nwell dimensions accounting for the disparity in resonance\nmagnitudes. For RT to occur, quantum well structures must\nexist at the o-MWNT surface, the justification of which is\noutlined below.\nIt is suggested that the o-MWNT carboxylic moiety\ngives rise to a quantum well structure, providing the local-\nized surface states necessary for RT to occur. Adsorbed water\nmolecules may also contribute to this effect. For many years\nFE has been known to be strongly influenced by the exis-\ntence of adsorbates; RT through the energy levels of atoms\nand molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces plays a major role\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 Current-field curves for o-MWNTs on carbon\nfiber substrates \u0001upward cycle only\u0002 and \u0001b\u0002 the same data plotted in FN\ncoordinates. \u0001c\u0002 Derivative plot of the current-field data, highlighting the\nstaircaselike nature of the data.

In this\ncase, electrons are more likely to tunnel from metal to\nvacuum through the energy levels of the adsorbate due to a\nreduction in the effective thickness of the triangular barrier.\nDuke and Alferieff27 illustrated this by performing a one-\ndimensional exact wave matching integral to evaluate FE\ntransmission for a triangular barrier with various combina-\ntions of square wells and delta functions representing the\nadsorbate. They showed that adsorbates lead to wide reso-\nnances in the emission probability, an additional peak in the\nelectron energy distribution at the resonant energy, large en-\nhancement in the FE current, and reductions in the FN slope.\nThe first experimental observation of RT through adsorbates\nwas made by Plummer et al.28 in 1969, as peaks in the en-\nergy distribution of electrons emitted from zirconium ad-\nsorbed on tungsten. This work led to the development of\natomic spectroscopy for adsorbed atoms. Furthermore, in FE\nmicroscopy the emitted current will increase if an atom or\nmolecule is adsorbed onto the local probe area due to RT\nenhancement.29 More recently, RT through localized surface\nstates in chemisorbed molecules has been used to explain the\nlobed patterns observed in FE microscopy from CNT caps.29\nAs the temperature of the emitter increases, the lobes disap-\npear and the emission current is reduced due to thermal re-\nmoval of the adsorbates. RT through surface states is also\nwidely observed and utilized in scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy.30\u201332\nThese RT effects have traditionally been observed via\nfine structure in the electron energy distribution of emitted\nelectrons, whereby energy peaks visible in the energy spectra\nrepresent resonances. Otherwise, lobed patterns observed in\nFE microscopy have been explained by RT and scattering of\nelectrons through adsorbates.33 However, fine structure in the\nFE current caused by localized surface states has rarely been\nreported, possibly due to the high field resolution necessary\nto resolve the individual resonances.\nGiven the theoretical predictions of RT in FE and the\nexperimental observations of RT effects from surface adsor-\nbates, it is likely that the experimental results presented here\ndo indeed represent RT through the localized electronic en-\nergy levels of a chemisorbed molecule \u0001i.e., the carboxyl\nmoiety and\/or adsorbed water molecules\u0002. The steps ob-\nserved in the current-field data represent multiple electronic\nenergy levels confined in the carboxylic potential well. As\neach energy level aligns with the Fermi level of the MWNT,\nan increase in the FE current is expected, as observed experi-\nmentally. The disparity between the up and down cycles can\nbe explained by slow decharging due to trapped states in the\nquantum wells. These staircaselike characteristics have not\nbeen previously observed in the literature due to the very\nhigh field resolution necessary to resolve individual current\nsteps \u0001each being around 0.05 V \/\u0001m wide\u0002. This was only\nachievable in these samples due to very low threshold fields.\nThis work provides an insight into the underlying mecha-\nnisms of FE and as such could lead to applications in FE\ndevices, for example, by tailoring chemisorbed and adsorbed\natoms or molecules on surfaces to enhance the tunneling\nefficiency of electrons into vacuum, thereby improving FE\nefficiency.\nIn summary, staircaselike current-field characteristics\nwere observed in FE from o-MWNTs. RT was explored as an\nexplanation for this behavior, and published theory compared\nwell with experiment. The carboxyl surface moiety is as-\nsumed to form a quantum well structure with multiple reso-\nnant energy levels. RT through these electronic subbands\nleads to quantized increases in the FE current with increasing\nfield strength.\nThe authors would like to thank Lucian Dragos Filip and\nWei-Mong Tsang for useful discussions and EPSRC \u0001U.K.\u0002\nfor funding the research via the CBE and Portfolio Partner-\nship awards.\n1O.
