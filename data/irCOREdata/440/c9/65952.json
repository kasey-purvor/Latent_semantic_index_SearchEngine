Khok Phanom Di was a sedentary\ncoastal community that apparently relied on hunting, gath-\nering, and fishing in the midst of a transition to rice agri-\nculture in the interior. The results of the isotope analyses\nindicate female immigration and then a marked shift to local\nstrontium isotope signatures among females accompanied by\na clear increase in the prestige of female burials. A possible\nexplanation is a shift in the pattern of exogamy with a con-\ncomitant change in gender relations. Observation of a very\nsimilar transition at Ban Chiang, in northeastern Thailand,\nsuggests the possibility of a regionwide social transition. In\nthe case of Khok Phanom Di, the increasing role of females\nin producing high-quality ceramic vessels may have contrib-\nuted to the change.\nIn contrast to the rapid and complete spread of agriculture\ninto central Europe about 7,500 years ago in only a century\nor two, hunting and gathering persisted in parts of prehistoric\nSoutheast Asia for many centuries after agriculture arrived\nabout 4,000 years ago (Bellwood 2005). In fact, hunter-gath-\nerer populations have persisted in parts of Southeast Asia until\nthe present, including the \u201cPeople of the Yellow Leaves\u201d or\nPhi Tong Luang in northern Thailand (Pookajorn and Staff\n1992). There is every reason to believe that farmers would\nhave continued to hunt and gather alongside their cultivation\n\u0001 2007 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.\nAll rights reserved. 0011-3204\/2007\/4802-0006$10.00\n(Morrison 2006). Rural people in Thailand still hunt and\ngather as much as they can where the wildlife (small animals,\nsnakes, insects, plants) has survived predation, and foraging\ncontinues to contribute to the diet.\nIn the case of Southeast Asia, there is still much to be\nlearned about the nature of the prehistoric intensification of\nfarming during and after the third millennium BC. A major\nquestion concerns who was involved\u2014that is, to what degree\nagriculture spread with the migration of farmers from south-\nern China as opposed to being gradually adopted by indig-\nenous hunter-gatherers. Another question is, given some de-\ngree of farmer colonization, how much intermarriage there\nwas between migrant farmers and native hunter-gatherers.\nThe answers undoubtedly varied from one region to another.\nOther questions center around how it happened and what\nthe consequences were\u2014for example, whether individual\nspecializations such as cultivators, livestock herders, fisher\nfolk, and\/or hunter-gatherers emerged. These questions are\nabout social changes as much as they are about environ-\nmental adaptations. In small-scale societies, individual de-\ncisions about subsistence activity are never far from the\nbonds of kinship, and in almost all prehistoric settings we\ncan expect strong relationships between prehistoric subsis-\ntence, specialized occupations, and kinship systems. For ex-\nample, the spread of pastoralism into sub-Saharan Africa\nhas been shown to have caused a regionwide shift from\nmatriliny to patriliny, probably because male control of live-\nstock made matriliny unsustainable (Holden and Mace\n2003). In Island Southeast Asia and Melanesia, matrilineal\nkinship and matrilocality have been more common in the\npast, especially among coastal groups and hunter-gatherers,\npossibly because the absence of men on fishing or hunting\nexpeditions leaves the women to manage the interests of the\nkin group (Hage and Marck 2003). In fact, since gene dis-\ntributions suggest a prehistory of matrilocality in parts of\nThailand (Oota et al. 2001), as opposed to prehistoric pa-\ntrilocality in Europe (Bentley et al. 2002; Seielstad, Minch,\nand Cavalli-Sforza 1998), the comparatively long persistence\nof hunting-gathering in Thailand leads to an interesting\nquestion: Did matrilocal residence correspond to the pre-\nhistoric intensification of agriculture? Isotopic evidence\nfrom Ban Chiang, in northeastern Thailand, suggests a pos-\nsible transition to matrilocality during the second millen-\nnium BC (Bentley et al. 2005). Perhaps the prolonged tran-\nsition to agriculture in Thailand is associated with a\nmatrilocal marriage custom that existed during the same\ntime period. With anthropological reasons to suggest that\nforager societies are less virilocal (Fox 1983; Hage and Marck\n2003; Marlowe 2004) and that the reckoning of descent can\nshift in response to changes in subsistence (Holden and\nMace 2003, 2005), we propose to characterize human mo-\nbility and residence at Khok Phanom Di during this crucial\nprehistoric period.\n302 Current Anthropology Volume 48, Number 2, April 2007\nFigure 1. Geographic setting, showing sites mentioned in text: 1, Khok\nPhanom Di; 2, Non Pa Wai; 3, Khok Charoen; 4, Ban Tha Kae; 5, Ban\nChiang. Inset, area of Khok Phanom Di, showing probable sources of\nstone artifacts.\nKhok Phanom Di\nIn this study, our objective was to acquire direct evidence\nregarding human mobility during the period when agriculture\nwas being adopted from the prehistoric individuals involved\nby measuring isotopes of strontium, carbon, and oxygen in\nthe tooth enamel of human skeletons from the archaeological\ncommunity of Khok Phanom Di (ca. 2100\u20131500 BC). The\nsite (Higham and Thosarat 1994, 2004), which lies on a\nmound in the lower valley of the Bang Pakong, was located\nadjacent to a mangrove-fringed shore of a major estuary (fig.\n1). Over the period of occupation, which lasted for at least\nhalf a millennium, the environment underwent a series of\nchanges. One of these, pinpointed to a brief period during\nthe third and fourth of seven mortuary phases, witnessed a\nfall in sea level and the establishment of freshwater conditions\nin the vicinity of the settlement. A reversion to saline con-\nditions deleterious to rice cultivation ensued during the final\nthree mortuary phases.\nAlthough domesticated rice is present from the earliest levels\nat Khok Phanom Di, it is never found in great quantities, and\nit is still uncertain whether rice was cultivated locally or im-\nported from surrounding agricultural communities (Thomp-\nson 1996). The few rice-tempered potsherds from the earliest\ncontexts were all exotic to the site (Vincent 2004). In fact, the\ndiet of the occupants of the site during mortuary phases 1,\n2, and 3A centred on gathered marine and estuarine resources,\nparticularly fish, shellfish, and crabs (table 1). The biological\nremains from these three phases are dominated by the marine\nbivalve Anadara granosa, the marine and estuarine fish Lates\ncalcarifer and Plotosus canius, and the mangrove crab Scylla\nserrata (Cassaidy 1991; Kijngam 1991).\nWith mortuary phases 3B and 4, however, there is un-\n303\nTable 1. The Mortuary Sequence at Khok Phanom Di\nMortuary\nPhase Date (cal BC)\nNumber\nof Burials Diet Environmental Conditions\n1 1900\u20131850 6 Marine fish, shellfish, crabs Estuarine-coastal mangrove\n2 1850\u20131800 55 Marine fish, shellfish, crabs Estuarine-coastal mangrove\n3A 1800\u20131750 23 Marine fish, shellfish, crabs Estuarine-coastal mangrove\n3B 1750\u20131700 20 Increasing freshwater fish, rice Freshwater ponds, lakes\n4 1700\u20131650 29 Increasing freshwater fish, rice Freshwater ponds, lakes\n5 1650\u20131600 4 Marine Estuarine-coastal mangrove\n6 1600\u20131500 12 Marine Estuarine-coastal mangrove\n7 ca.1500 5 Marine Estuarine-coastal mangrove\ndoubted evidence for the consumption of cultivated rice in\nthe form of rice husk remains in human faeces and stomach\ncontents. At this juncture, the relative frequency of freshwater\nindicators increases at the expense of mangrove and marine\nspecies. There is no evidence for the domestication of any\nanimal other than the dog during the course of the seven\nmortuary phases. Dog remains are also so few that even if\nconsumed they would have contributed a minute part of the\nhuman diet. Other mammals found during the currency of\nthe mortuary phases include three species of deer, bovids,\nmonkeys, and pigs, but they too were always rare throughout\nthe mortuary sequence. This contrasts with inland sites, such\nas Ban Chiang in northeastern Thailand (Pietrusewsky and\nDouglas 2002), where initial settlement witnessed rice culti-\nvation and the presence of domestic cattle, pigs, and dogs.\nAs in all sites from the Neolithic period to the present, how-\never, hunting, gathering, and fishing continued unabated\n(Higham 2002).\nThe 154 graves found at the site fall into seven successive\nmortuary phases, each distinguished not only stratigraphically\nbut also by changes in ritual and the type and quantity of\nofferings (Higham and Thosarat 2004). Six burials represent\nthe first phase (MP 1). They were scattered across the site\nand interred at a time when marine shell middens were ac-\ncumulating. Numerous hearths were encountered, while bone\nawls and clay net weights were added to the artefact assem-\nblage. Changes in ceramics compared with those found in the\ninitial occupation layers at the base of the site have been noted\nby Vincent (2004), changes that might reflect settlement by\na new group of people.\nThere is an increase in fishhooks and net weights in MP\n2, stressing the importance of fishing to this community. It\nwas during this period that the first one or two dog bones\nwere found. There is no discernible difference in grave goods\nplaced with men and women in the MP 2 burials, which\nincluded red ochre, intricately decorated pottery vessels, shell\nbeads, stone adzes, cowrie shells, and animal teeth.\nAn increase in freshwater shellfish species and a corre-\nsponding decrease in intertidal species indicates a transition\nto a non-estuarine environment during late MP 3 (3B) and\nMP 4. During MP 3B there is evidence suggestive of an influx\nof immigrants\u2014new ceramic decorations and different\nsources of clay and temper, possibly introduced by immigrant\nwomen with new potting traditions (Vincent 2004).\nA series of changes in mortuary behaviour took place with\nMP 4. Burials were now more evenly spaced, and men and\nwomen were distinguished by different sets of grave offerings.\nMen were interred with large turtle-carapace ornaments, while\nwomen were associated with the anvils used in the forming\nof ceramic vessels. Rice was cultivated locally during MP\n3B\u2013MP 4, seen not only in the presence of shell reaping knives\nand granite hoes but also in the remains of rice in stomach\ncontents and human faeces. Compared with previous phases,\ninfant mortality was lower, and men had weaker musculature\n(Tayles 1999). As conditions reverted back to a coastal man-\ngrove swamp during MP 5, status differences became more\npronounced, particularly in the most prominent burial from\nKhok Phanom Di (B15), dubbed the \u201cPrincess,\u201d who was\ninterred with over 120,000 beads, an anvil, burnishing stones,\nclay preforms, and pottery with exotic trace-element com-\nposition (Vincent 2004). An infant interred adjacent to this\nrich woman was accorded precisely the same ritual in death,\nincluding a miniature clay anvil and clay preforms over the\nbody. Social conditions appear to have become more complex\nwith the return to marine fishing and gathering during this\nphase, as exotic ivory and shale appeared and females were\nburied with specialist potting equipment. Mortuary practices\nwere further elaborated during MP 6, with substantial mor-\ntuary structures, one of which contained three distinctively\nrich burials: a woman in her mid-twenties with bracelets and\n1,600 thin shell beads (B19), a woman over 40 with almost\n10,000 shell disc beads (B18), and, on top of her, a child with\nover 17,000 beads (B6).\nMethods\nIn order to characterize the variation in human geographic\norigins and diets, we analyzed isotopes of strontium, carbon,\nand oxygen in archaeological tooth enamel sampled from the\nKhok Phanom Di individuals.\nStrontium Isotopes\nStrontium isotope signatures (87Sr\/86Sr) are conveyed, without\nmeasurably fractionating, from eroded rocks through soils\n304 Current Anthropology Volume 48, Number 2, April 2007\ninto the food chain and thus serve as geologic\/geographic\nsignatures in the mineral of mammalian tooth enamel (e.g.,\nEricson 1985; Bentley 2006). The strontium isotope signature\nin tooth enamel derives from the biologically available stron-\ntium of the region, which at least partly reflects the geologic\nmaterial where the diet was obtained during childhood (when\nthe enamel was forming). For settled communities, a parsi-\nmonious interpretation of a \u201cnon-local\u201d ratio in87 86Sr\/ Sr\ntooth enamel is that the person was an immigrant, but often\nanother possibility is that the person spent substantial child-\nhood time elsewhere. Also, isotopic \u201clocals\u201d may actually have\nmigrated between geochemical provinces with similar\nratios, such as coastal areas.87 86Sr\/ Sr\nGeology provides a general basis for what we expect the\nbiologically available to be in different areas. Khok87 86Sr\/ Sr\nPhanom Di is located on the lower Chao Phraya Plain, which\nis a fault-bounded basin that formed during the Plio-Pleis-\ntocene and has since filled with almost 2,000 m of Quaternary\nsediments (Sinsakul 2000). These sediments reflect both the\ndeposits of the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries and 15\nm of tide-dominated delta deposits of soft marine clay in the\narea of modern Bangkok (Aitken 2004; Sinsakul 2000). Given\nalso its coastal position, we expect the local strontium isotope\nsignature at the site to be dominated by marine sources, since\nsea spray or precipitation can be major strontium sources in\nenvironments that are more extremely weathered and coastal\n(e.g., Chadwick et al. 1999; Whipkey et al. 2000). Because of\nthe long residence time of strontium in the oceans,\nin sea water is essentially a worldwide constant of87 86Sr\/ Sr\n0.7092, which applies throughout the Holocene (McArthur,\nHowarth, and Bailey 2001), with very slight deviations (!\n) associated with local inputs of discharging rivers (La-0.0001\nvelle and Armstrong 1993). Therefore we expect the biolog-\nically available at the site to be within about87 86Sr\/ Sr \u0002\nof the sea-water value of 0.7092 for residents eating0.0001\nseafood and possibly even for those eating foods raised on\nlocal land. Although this means that immigrants from other\nmaritime communities may be indistinguishable from locals\nby alone, we gain added resolution by measuring87 86Sr\/ Sr\ncarbon and oxygen isotopes in the same samples. Certainly\nalso, values significantly different from 0.7092 can be easily\nidentified as non-local. In particular, we expect much higher\nratios from the granitoid belts distributed throughout87 86Sr\/ Sr\nThailand (Charusiri et al. 1993), including areas within\n60\u2013100 km southeast of Khok Phanom Di (fig. 1), with typical\nstrontium concentrations in these granites on the order of\n50\u2013200 ppm (Wu and Ishihara 1994). These north\u2013south-\ntrending granite belts generally originated during the Late\nTriassic to early Jurassic (220\u2014180 million years ago) from\npartial melting of crustal rocks, and the isotopic data available\nindicate that they would be a source of much higher\nratios (Charusiri et al. 1993; Beckinsale et al. 1979).87 86Sr\/ Sr\nThe Khao Daen granites, for example, which outcrop near\nthe western coast of Thailand, have whole rock ratios87 86Sr\/ Sr\nranging between 0.749 and 0.820, while the Hub Kapong\nTriassic granite complex, southwest of Khok Phanom Di in\nthe northern Thai Peninsula, has whole-rock ratios87 86Sr\/ Sr\nof 0.775\u20130.789 (Beckinsale et al. 1979). Furthermore, these\nuplands were the likely sources for stone tools such as adzes\nand burnishing stones at Khok Phanom Di and may have\nbeen traded in by communities occupying these areas\n(Higham and Thosarat 1994, 96\u201399).\nGiven the local variability in soils, rocks, and plants (e.g.,\nSillen et al. 1998; Capo, Stewart, and Chadwick 1998), the\nbest way to \u201cmap\u201d the prehistoric, biologically available\nratios is to sample it directly in the tooth enamel of87 86Sr\/ Sr\nlocal animals from archaeological sites around the study area\n(Bentley, Price, and Stephan 2004). Local animals do a won-\nderful job of averaging the in their feeding area87 86Sr\/ Sr\n(Burton, Price, and Middleton 1999). As in southern Ger-\nmany (Bentley and Knipper 2005), regional analysis is a long-\nterm endeavour the expense of which is warranted by its value\nin explaining the ongoing isotopic results from human and\ndomestic animal skeletons. For this region of Thailand, map-\nping of the biologically available signatures is a work87 86Sr\/ Sr\nin progress (cf. Bentley et al. 2005).\nCarbon Isotopes\nCarbon isotopes 12C and 13C fractionate during primary pro-\nduction of organic matter in such a way that plants (e.g.,C3\nrice) have (relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite [PDB]13d C\ncarbonate standard) values between \u000123 and \u000134\u2030\n(O\u2019Leary 1988). Fortuitously, King (2006, table 6.2) recently\nmeasured a significant number of samples of mod-(np 34)\nern rice (both wild and domestic) from northeastern Thailand\nwhose average we calculate to be (including13d C \u000124.8\u0002 0.6\nKing\u2019s correction of 1.5\u2030 for the fossil-fuel effect). For ma-\nrine foods at Khok Phanom Di, we can offer an approximate\nestimate of \u000114.0\u2030 based on analyses from the Marianas\nIslands by Ambrose et al. (1997).\nFor reasons of sample availability, we measured in13d C\ntooth enamel (rather than bone collagen), which is enriched\nin humans (non-ruminant species) by about 9.4\u2030 relative\nto the whole diet (Ambrose and Norr 1993; Koch, Fogel, and\nTuross 1994; Tieszen and Fagre 1993; Ambrose et al. 1997).\nWe thus expect that in tooth-enamel carbonate should13d C\nbe about \u000115.4\u2030 (\u000124.8\u2030 \u0002 9.4\u2030 ) for a pure dietC3\n(rice) and about\u00014.6\u2030 (\u000114\u2030\u0002 9.4\u2030 ) for a pure marine\ndiet (Ambrose et al. 1997).\nUsing these end-members for a linear mixing model, we\ncan use to estimate percentages of marine foods in the13d C\ndiet, but, considering the uncertainties regarding in13d C\ncoastal food webs (Schoeninger and DeNiro 1984) and in\napatite (e.g., Prowse et al. 2004), we treat these estimates only\nas approximations. Given similar levels of temperature, hu-\nmidity, and insolation, all of which have secondary effects on\nin plants (Van Klinken, van der Plicht, and Hedges 1994;13d C\nHeaton 1999), the important possible causes of variations13d C\ninclude (a) consumption of marine resources, which are gen-\n305\nerally several per mil richer in than terrestrial plant13C C3\nfoods, (b) altitude, with high-altitude plants (above 1,000 m,\nadapted to lower partial pressure of ) being enriched inCO2\nby a few per mil (Ko\u00a8rner, Farquhar, and Wong 1991), (c)13C\nforest density, with plants growing beneath a dense forest\ncanopy having values several per mil more negative than13d C\nsimilar plants in cleared areas (Heaton 1999), and (d) meat\nconsumption, with increasing by about one per mil per13d C\ntrophic level (DeNiro and Epstein 1978; Post 2002).\nOxygen Isotopes\nOxygen isotope compositions ( , relative to standard mean18d O\nocean water [SMOW]) in the environment depend upon the\nfractionation of versus during evaporation, conden-18 16O O\nsation, and precipitation in the hydrologic cycle, with 18O\npreferentially retained in the liquid phase. Geographic origins\nare reflected in enamel values measured in species, in-18d O\ncluding humans, that take in much of their oxygen through\ningested water (e.g., Balasse et al. 2002; Budd et al. 2004;\nD\u2019Angela and Longinelli 1990; Kohn 1996). Determined\nlargely by temperature, the mean annual in precipitation18d O\ndepends on latitude and altitude (Bowen and Wilkinson 2002)\nbut also on topographic relief, distance from large bodies of\nwater, and relative humidity. Because of the time-averaging\neffect of enamel formation, variations in mammal tooth18d O\nenamel are less than the seasonal variations in precipi-18d O\ntation (e.g., Balasse et al. 2002; Passey et al. 2005). In humans\nfrom settled communities, whose water supply is more con-\nsistent, the variations are smaller, with tooth enamel 18d O\npotentially varying as little as 1\u2030 among prehistoric people\nfrom one place (Budd et al. 2004). Unfortunately, in this\ntropical region of the world, there does not appear to be much\nsystematic geographic variation of in prehistoric human18d O\nenamel (cf. Krigbaum 2003; Bentley et al. 2005). Nevertheless,\nin theory we expect that may be depleted in enamel from18O\npeople who lived inland; tends to decrease with distance18d O\nfrom the sea, as is preferentially condensed in clouds18O\ncarrying rain from the sea.\nProcedures\nIn order to characterize patterns of human mobility at Khok\nPhanom Di, we measured strontium, carbon, and oxygen\nisotopes in tooth enamel from selected human skeletons, with\nsampling preference for the premolar (crown complete be-\ntween ages 3 and 6 years [Hillson 1997, 123]) second molar\n(ages 7\u20138), or third molar (ages 12\u201316) wherever possible.\nMany studies indicate that buried prehistoric bone tends to\nbe contaminated by groundwater strontium (Bentley, Price\nand Stephan 2004; Horn and Mu\u00a8ller-Sohnius 1999), so while\nhuman bone may help identify the local ratio at the87 86Sr\/ Sr\nsite, we focus our analyses on the tooth enamel, which ro-\nbustly resists isotopic contamination (e.g., Chiaradia, Gallay,\nand Todt 2003; Hoppe, Koch, and Furutani 2003; Horn, Ho\u00a8lzl,\nand Storzer 1994; Koch, Tuross, and Fogel 1997; Trickett et\nal. 2003; Bentley 2006). The Khok Phanom Di sample includes\na tooth fragment each from 30 adult females, 23 adult males,\nand 19 children.\nUsing our regular procedure (e.g., Bentley et al. 2004, 2005;\nBentley and Knipper 2005), we mechanically cleaned about\n5\u201320 mg of tooth enamel from each individual and removed\nits dentine with a surgical steel scalpel and then soaked it for\neight hours in weak (5%) acetic acid. After the strontium was\npurified through columns of Sr-spec resin, the was87 86Sr\/ Sr\nanalyzed using a VG-MicroMass Sector 54 thermal ionization\nmass spectrometer at the Southampton Oceanography Centre.\nDuring the time period of the analyses, four measurements\nof the NBS SRM-987 standard yielded an average 87 86Sr\/ Sr\nratio of 0.710245 0.000010 (1 s.d.).\u0002\nWe also measured and in the carbonate ( )18 13d O d C CO3\ncomponent of the tooth enamel, following a tested procedure\n(Balasse et al. 2002; Koch, Tuross, and Fogel 1997) that we\nhave used successfully at the Ban Chiang site in Thailand\n(Bentley et al. 2005). About 5 mg of tooth enamel (sampled\nfrom the cervix end whenever possible) was mechanically\ncleaned of all dentine, powdered and soaked overnight in 5%\nacetic acid to remove post-burial carbonate contamination,\nand then analysed via a Kiel III automated cryogenic distil-\nlation system interfaced with a ThermoFinnigan Mat 253 gas-\nsource mass spectrometer at the Bloomsbury Environmental\nIsotope Facility, University College London. Repeated analyses\nof the NBS 19 standard yielded a precision better than 0.1\u2030\n(1 s.d.) for and 0.05\u2030 for .18 13d O d C\nResults\nThe results of strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotope analyses\nof human tooth enamel samples are shown in table 2. An\nestimate of the local comes from tooth samples from87 86Sr\/ Sr\n17 of the children,1 which yielded an average of87 86Sr\/ Sr\n0.70933 0.00005 over the seven mortuary phases. The re-\u0002\nmarkably low variance in these values and their closeness to\nthe expected sea-water value (0.7092) indicates that these chil-\ndren were raised locally. To double-check the local range (see\nBentley, Price, and Stephan 2004; Bentley and Knipper 2005),\nwe analysed enamel samples from seven pigs from Khok\nPhanom Di and found that they yielded a mean of87 86Sr\/ Sr\n0.70924 0.00005 (table 3), whereas a single rat tooth had\u0002\na value of 0.70926. The mean pig ratio was within87 86Sr\/ Sr\n0.0001 of the average in the human children\u2019s teeth, rein-\n1. Two outliers were not included. A deciduous tooth from Burial 96,\na four-year old child, yielded a vastly lower value (0.70753) than87 86Sr\/ Sr\nany other sample and unlike any other (\u00016.1). We view this cau-13d C\ntiously, as Burial 96 was heavily disturbed in prehistory. The second\noutlier is an anomalously low value (0.70914) from Burial 2, a87 86Sr\/ Sr\nnine-month-old infant from MP 6 that was found crushed and\nfragmented.\n306 Current Anthropology Volume 48, Number 2, April 2007\nTable 2.

Inter-\nestingly, the pigs ranged in from about\u000115\u2030 to\u000113\u203013d C\n(table 3), indicating that while two pigs had very little marine\nfood in their diet, as we might have expected, some pigs\napparently ate a significant amount ( ) of marine-based! 25%\nfoods, presumably as scraps from people or perhaps feeding\nthemselves on the shore.\nPartially digested domesticated rice remains associated with\nan adult female (B56) and an adult male (B67) in MP 3 burials\nprovided a special opportunity to test the result from rice\neaters. These individuals yielded ratios (0.70947 and87 86Sr\/ Sr\n0.70943) above the sea-water value, suggesting that this ter-\nrestrial input may be the reason the mean for all87 86Sr\/ Sr\nKhok Phanom Di adults is slightly above the sea-water value:\n0.70946 0.00018 for all adult females ( ) and 0.70934\u0002 np 30\n0.00009 for all adult males ( ). The values of18\u0002 np 23 d O\nthe female (25.0\u2030 ) and the male (24.5\u2030 ) are on the low\nend of the range, and the comparatively negative value13d C\n(\u000113.7\u2030 ) for the female suggests that seafood was only a\nminor ( %) component of the diet.! 20\nFigures 2\u20134 show the detailed results by chronological mor-\ntuary phase. The two adult males from MP 1 (B147, B152)\nhave virtually the same (0.70921) and (\u000113\u2030)87 86 13Sr\/ Sr d C\nvalues, so if they were immigrants they probably came from\nthe same place. One of these men (B147) was the tallest person\nin the sample (Tayles 1999, 338). The MP 1 female (B154)\nhad the highest ratio (0.70998) in the study, clearly87 86Sr\/ Sr\n2. Interestingly, the mean for the pigs is actually significantly87 86Sr\/ Sr\nlower than for the children ( ), probably because of the lack ofp ! 0.002\nany seafood in the pig diet, as the pigs have a comparatively negative\nmean (\u000113.7 0.8).13d C \u0002\nnon-local and also quite different from the males. This 25-\nyear-old woman was also one of the tallest females in the\ngroup.\nFor MP 2, we find that the in three females (B109,87 86Sr\/ Sr\nB110, B122) is distinctly higher than in the males or the six\nother MP 2 females (figure 5,a). Looking at MP 1 and MP\n2 combined, the individuals form a diagonal array in which\nand are positively correlated along what appears87 86 13Sr\/ Sr d C\nto be a continuum with males at one end and females at the\nother. Since the ratio in seafood is 0.7092, the source87 86Sr\/ Sr\nof the higher ratios must be inland. Curiously, how-87 86Sr\/ Sr\never, the sea-water ratios correspond to more negative87 86Sr\/ Sr\nvalues, which is the opposite of what we would expect13d C\nwith a seafood diet. Seafood should push the values13d C\ntowards \u00014.6\u2030 (pure-seafood end-member) in enamel car-\nbonate. Thus the positive correlation in figure 5, a, between\nand suggests other possibilities for the en-87 86 13 13Sr\/ Sr d C C\nrichment, including altitude, forest clearance, and plantsC4\nin the diet. Altitude seems unlikely, since there no areas over\n1,000 m in this region, but forest clearance and a small portion\nof plants are entirely possible with inland agricultural set-C4\ntlements. Although millets are not commonly discussedC4\nfor this period, it is possible that they were consumed in\nlimited quantities (Mudar 1995). An alternative explanation\nis that, as we move towards the upper right in the diagonal\narray of figure 5, a, the marine portion of the diet includes\nmore higher-trophic-level marine foods, which have less\nstrontium than lower-level marine organisms such as shellfish\n(Burton and Price 1999). In this setting, a mixing profile could\nreflect relative dependence on shellfish (marine ,87 86Sr\/ Sr\nlower ) versus higher-trophic-level marine fauna (less ma-13d C\nrine-looking , higher ).

In any case, given the indications of\nimported rice in MP 1-2, it seems likely that these women\n(B109, B110, B122, B154) ate inland foods as children and,\ngiven their taller statures (Tayles 1999), were probably im-\nmigrants to the Khok Phanom Di community.\nBy early MP 3, the mean for females87 86Sr\/ Sr\n( ) is still higher than for males (0.709350.70942\u0002 0.00008\n0.00010) but not significantly so ( ), and there is\u0002 p ! 0.16\nless variation in or than in the previous phases. In13 18d C d O\nfact, with the exception of an 18-year-old male (B92) and a\nchild, the early MP 3 individuals cluster on a plot of 18d O\nversus , suggestive of a localized group (fig. 6, b),87 86Sr\/ Sr\nwhile the values (fig. 5, b) between \u000114\u2030 and \u000112\u203013d C\nwould indicate diets of perhaps 10%\u201330% marine foods.\nThe three females from MP 3B (the latter half of MP 3)\nshow a wider spread of ratios than females from MP87 86Sr\/ Sr\n3A ( -test). One of these females (B58) has a near-p ! 0.005, F\nsea-water value (0.70917), whereas another (B64), in her early\ntwenties, has the second-highest value (0.70990) of87 86Sr\/ Sr\nour sample. The values further suggest that B58 (13d C \u223c\nmarine diet) came from a coastal location, whereas B6440%\n( marine diet) came from inland (fig. 5, b). Immigra-\u223c 15%\ntion of females would be consistent with the archaeology in\nthat Vincent\u2019s (2004) identification of new sources of clay and\ntemper from MP 3B \u201cmight mean that people with potting\nskills, almost certainly women, were entering the community\nfrom other settlements which shared the same basic ceramic\ntradition\u201d (Higham 2002, 65). Identifying the possible origin\nof these putative immigrants will require considerably more\nresearch in the hinterland of Khok Phanom Di. Fieldwork in\nthe Khao Wong Prachan Valley north of Lopburi has led to\nthe recognition of a Neolithic settlement at Non Pa Wai, which\nis a possible source (Mudar and Vincent 2003), while Ban\nTha Kae has yielded Neolithic burials and ceramic vessels\nresembling those from Khok Phanom Di (Siripanith 1985).\nKhok Charoen in the Pa Sak Valley (fig. 1) is a Neolithic\ncemetery that has yielded shell ornaments very similar to those\nfrom Khok Phanom Di, indicating a probable trade link (Ho\n1984). These sites must rank as the most likely sources for\nwomen moving south to coastal centers such as Khok Phanom\nDi.\nA change occurs in MP 4 (fig. 2), where the mean\n( , ) for females is signifi-87 86Sr\/ Sr 0.70939\u0002 0.00008 np 8\ncantly ( ) less variable than for MP 1\u2013MP 3 and sta-p ! 0.005\ntistically indistinguishable from the mean among MP 4 males\n( , ). This abrupt reduction in the var-0.70936\u0002 0.00008 np 8\niance of among females is accompanied by a reduc-87 86Sr\/ Sr\ntion in the range of for both sexes (fig. 4). At the same18d O\ntime, the values from both sexes in MP 4 show a broader13d C\nrange of (from \u000114\u2030 to \u000111\u2030 ) than in any of the13d C\npreceding periods (fig. 3). MP 4 carries the first isotopic sign\nof a possible dietary difference between sexes in that the mean\nmay be higher among males ( , two-tailed t test);13d C p ! 0.10\nthe lowest three values are from females and the highest13d C\nthree values are from males. This should be viewed cau-13d C\ntiously, however, as the similarity of tooth wear among males\nand females and the stratigraphic association of hoes and\nharvesting knives suggest that rice was being cultivated locally\nby this time (Higham 2002, 72\u201380). The difference between\nmales and females in and possibly again accords87 86 13Sr\/ Sr d C\nwith the independent archaeological evidence, particularly\nnew mortuary treatments, in which men were buried with\nlarge turtle-carapace ornaments and women were often as-\nsociated with the clay anvils used to make pottery (Higham\n2002, 73).\nDuring MP 5, the ratios for both sexes appear87 86Sr\/ Sr\nmostly within the local range (fig. 2). Burial 15 (the \u201cPrin-\ncess\u201d) yielded a thoroughly average ratio of 0.70939,87 86Sr\/ Sr\nwhich was repeated (0.70942) by a remeasurement of a sep-\narate piece of enamel from the same tooth (upper right ).P1\nHer value (\u000112.1\u2030) is in the range expected for marine13d C\nfoods, and so while our null hypothesis of local residence\nremains valid, migration from another coastal community\n(similar marine ) cannot be ruled out for her (or,87 86Sr\/ Sr\nindeed, for any of the burials in MP 5). In any case, the rich\nburial of a woman, potentially local, suggests a new level of\n309\nFigure 3. in human enamel from Khok Phanom Di by chro-13d C\nnological phase. \u0003, female; , male; \u0002, child.\u0001\nFigure 4. in human enamel from Khok Phanom Di by18d O\nchronological phase. \u0003, female; , male; \u0002, child.\u0001\nveneration for at least certain females. Burial 43, a 30-year-\nold male with over 56,000 beads and a turtle carapace, among\nother items, also yielded the same (0.70942) and87 86Sr\/ Sr\n(\u000112.1\u2030) as Burial 15. It appears probable that these13d C\nrich individuals had the same childhood origins and diets.\nAs in MP 5, the elaborate burials in MP 6 yielded similar,\nlocal ratios (fig. 2). For MP 5\u2013MP 6, the and87 86 13Sr\/ Sr d C\ncluster fairly closely, suggestive of local origins (figs. 5,18d O\nd, and 6, d). The single outlier in figure 6,d, is from one18d O\nof the two exceptionally rich burials from MP 6, a 42-year-\nold woman (B18). The other rich burial, a 25-year-old woman\n(B19), had isotopic values within the local ranges.\nConclusion\nThree significant patterns emerge from the isotope data at\nKhok Phanom Di:\n1. Over all chronological phases, the for males87 86Sr\/ Sr\nfalls within a narrow range (0.70934 0.00009, )\u0002 np 23\nthat is consistent with artefact evidence for fishing supple-\nmented by some terrestrial foods. Whereas these near-sea-\nwater ratios cannot distinguish local men from fish-87 86Sr\/ Sr\nermen from other coastal communities, the spread of 18d O\nvalues would allow for a variety of coastal origins or travel\nduring these men\u2019s childhoods.\n2. During the early phases (MP 1 and MP 2), several adult\nfemales appear at the high end of a diagonal array of\nversus that, together with their greater stature,87 86 13Sr\/ Sr d C\nstrongly suggests that these women migrated from inland to\nthe Khok Phanom Di community.\n3. Of the three individuals from MP 3B, two females appear\nto be immigrants from different locations (one coastal, one\ninland). It was previously surmised from the presence of ex-\notic pottery decoration and the use of a different clay source\nthat female potters may have immigrated during this phase\n(Vincent 2004). While we can identify further design motifs\nwith inland parallels in MP 5\u20137 vessels, these were not as-\nsociated with a different clay source and hence more likely\nadopted through exchange and social contact rather than rep-\nresenting a further influx of women potters.\n4. In MP 4, the variance in female ratios is sig-87 86Sr\/ Sr\nnificantly reduced, such that the female ratios are87 86Sr\/ Sr\nrestricted within the narrow range that characterizes males.\nThe mean values suggest that diets might have been13d C\nsubtly different between the sexes ( ), which wouldpp 0.10\nnot be surprising given the differentiation in burial treatments\nfor males and females that began during this phase (Higham\n2002, 72\u201381).\n5. During and after MP 4, the rich female burials (B15,\nB18, B19) show local ratios. One rich male burial87 86Sr\/ Sr\n(B43) yielded the same strontium and carbon isotope values\nas the \u201cPrincess\u201d (B15).\nIn this sequence, the most significant pattern is that certain\nfemales from MP 1 to MP 3 exhibit the only substantially\nnon-local strontium isotope signatures, with an abrupt tran-\nsition to local signatures in MP 4. Since Khok Phanom Di is\na 5-ha site and the burials are from a 10 m by 10 m excavation\nsquare, one might argue that this is simply a sampling issue\u2014\nthat during MP 4 a certain segment of the Khok Phanom Di\ncommunity was buried here. However, coincidences of sam-\npling are all but ruled out by (a) the spatial contiguity of the\nburial clusters, enough even to suggest kin relatedness\n(Higham and Thosarat 1994, 39\u201349), (b) the logical agree-\nment between the isotopic and the archaeological evidence\nfor the change at MP 4, and (c) the similar transition observed\nat Ban Chiang (Bentley et al. 2005). This was a change in\nsociety, and we offer three hypotheses for interpreting it:\nOne hypothesis is that the kinship system in the Khok\nPhanom Di community was initially patrilocal, as suggested\nby the female immigration in MP 1-2, but then became mat-\nrilocal as MP 4 began, when all female strontium isotope\nsignatures fell tightly into the local range. Unfortunately, the\n310 Current Anthropology Volume 48, Number 2, April 2007\nFigure 5. versus in human enamel from Khok Phanom87 86 13Sr\/ Sr d CPDB\nDi by chronological phase. \u0003, female; , male; \u0002, child.\u0001\nstrontium isotope evidence from males, consistently marine\nthroughout the sequence, cannot confirm or reject this hy-\npothesis, since seafaring males would have had similar stron-\ntium values isotope whether local or immigrant. What is com-\npelling, however, is that Higham and Thorsarat (1994,\n103\u201310) have independently made a case for an \u201cincreasing\nmatrilocal aspect to the later people at Khok Phanom Di\u201d\nbased on the mortuary evidence for female craft specialists\nand venerated women in the community.\nA second hypothesis is that women were immigrating\u2014\npossibly for marriage\u2014all along but from inland communities\nin MP 1\u20133 and from coastal groups during and after MP 4.\nThis would accord with the interpretation of Higham and\nThosarat (1994, 103\u201313) of increasing economic value of spe-\ncialist female potters, including the increasing association of\nclay anvils with women (and some with girls) indicative of\nthe transmission of potting skills from one generation of\nwomen to the next. Given increasing indications for maritime\ntrade during and after MP 4, new marriage links may have\ndeveloped along with new maritime contacts.\nThe third hypothesis involves the archaeological evidence\nfor an increase in locally grown rice during MP 4, which\nwould imply less mobility for both sexes. This, however, does\nnot easily explain why only females show the transition at\nMP 4, unless in MP 1\u20133 females had been eating a lot of\nfoods gathered from inland and males a lot of fish and other\nmarine foods. Although possible, this would require that cer-\ntain (but not all) MP 1\u20133 girls were given a special diet as\ntheir enamel formed, which would seem contrary to the in-\ncreased gender differentiation in burial goods from MP 4\nonwards.\nIn considering these hypotheses it should be recognized\nthat the isotopic changes have been observed in human tooth\nenamel, which forms during childhood. In any case, the fact\nthat the dramatic change in female mobility at MP 4 at Khok\nPhanom Di is not observed among males suggests an abrupt\nchange in marriage patterns and\/or the status and roles of\nwomen. During MP 5 and MP 6, the women who were clearly\nvenerated through rich burial also exhibit coastal isotope sig-\nnatures. Whether these are truly local as opposed to distantly\n311\nFigure 6. versus in human enamel from Khok Phanom87 86 18Sr\/ Sr d OSMOW\nDi by chronological phase. \u0003, female; , male; \u0002, child.\u0001\ncoastal signatures remains the subject of further investiga-\ntion\u2014the increased value of women in this society may have\nled to more female migration rather than less (matrilineal but\nnot matrilocal). If Khok Phanom Di was a coastal trading\ncommunity, women producing exchangeable pottery could\nhave become increasingly wealthy and prestigious, which\ntends to reinforce the matriline, especially in Melanesian ex-\nchange systems (Lepowsky 1983). Ethnographic and linguistic\nevidence indicates that Proto-Oceanic societies were predom-\ninantly matrilineal (Hage and Marck 2003), and many soci-\neties, such as the famous Trobrianders, remain matrilineal\ntoday (Allen 1984).\nIn regional context, the change in MP 4 at Khok Phanom\nDi is strikingly similar to that at Ban Chiang (ca. 2100 BC\u2013AD\n200) in northeastern Thailand, where during and after EP V\nthe range of among females is considerably reduced87 86Sr\/ Sr\n(fig. 7). Bentley et al (2005) have suggested that this change\nat Ban Chiang reflects a transition to matrilocality, while con-\nsidering an alternative hypothesis of a sexual division of la-\nbour such that males ranged over a wide area while hunting\nand gathering and females remained closer to the settlement.\nIn any case, it is remarkable to observe, at two distant sites,\nan abrupt reduction in the variance of strontium isotope sig-\nnatures among women, whereas the male signatures do not\nchange, remaining within a narrow range at Khok Phanom\nDi and continuing to be variable at Ban Chiang. The change\nat Khok Phanom Di is dated to about 1600\u20131700 BC and\nthat at Ban Chiang to about a millennium later. The reasons\nin each case must be sought in the context of site-specific\nevidence. At Khok Phanom Di, the importance of women\nwho manufactured ceramic vessels in a site that was clearly\na major pottery-making center is cited as one possible con-\ntributory factor.\nRegarding the emergence of agriculture in Neolithic South-\neast Asia, the dramatic nature of the change in female mobility\nat Khok Phanom Di could reflect the influence of another\nculture. The change at MP 4 coincides with increasing evi-\ndence for local rice cultivation, and if the two are causally\n312 Current Anthropology Volume 48, Number 2, April 2007\nFigure 7. in human enamel from Ban Chiang by chro-87 86Sr\/ Sr\nnological phase. \u0003, female; , male. Adapted from Bentley et\u0001\nal. (2005, fig. 2).\nlinked we still have the age-old question of whether the change\nwas prompted by the movement of people or the spread of\nideas. On one hand, the phase immediately preceding\u2014MP\n3B\u2014yields hints of an influx of immigrant women, who may\nhave introduced new agricultural (and potting) skills. On the\nother hand, the community of Khok Phanom Di, with its\ncomplex hunter-gatherer heritage, may have distinguished it-\nself with respect to the demographic changes that were oc-\ncurring in the region, with its women specializing in pottery\nexchange with new neighbours and new kinship and gender\nrelations following suit. In any case, the fact that a significant\nsocial transition took place at Khok Phanom Di and perhaps\nregionally over time (cf. Bentley et al. 2005) leads to new\nhypotheses to be investigated in the prehistory of the tran-\nsition to agriculture in this exciting and unique region.\nAcknowledgments\nFor providing access to a clean lab and a thermal ionization\nmass spectrometer for the strontium isotope analyses, we\nthank Rex Taylor, Matthew Cooper, and especially Tina Hayes\nof Southampton Oceanography Centre.
