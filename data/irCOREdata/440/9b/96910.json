Tissue interaction plays a major role in many morphogenetic pro- \ncesses, particularly those associated with skin organ primordia. We examine \ntravelling wave solutions in a tissue interaction model for skin pattern forma- \ntion which is firmly based on the known biology. From a phase space analysis \nwe conjecture the existence of travelling waves with specific wave speeds. \nSubsequently, analytical approximations to the wave profiles are derived \nusing perturbation methods. We then show numerically that such travelling \nwave solutions do exist and that they are in good agreement with our \nanalytical results. Finally, the biological implications of our analysis are \ndiscussed. \nKey words: Travelling waves - Tissue interaction - Perturbation procedure - \nWavespeed \nI Introduction \nTravelling wavefronts are the precursors to a vast range of developmental \nprocesses seen in embryonic tissue. For example, both chemical and mechan- \nical waves propagate on the surface of many vertebrate ggs shortly after \nfertilization. Furthermore, during morphogenesis, regular patterns often de- \nvelop behind a frontier of pattern which travels across tissue. \nCheer et al. (1987) proposed a reaction-diffusion system to model the \nprogression of calcium waves on the egg of the teleost fish Medaka. This \nmodel was extended by Lane et al. (1987) to account for cortical contraction \nwaves which accompany the calcium waves. They coupled the mechano- \nchemical system for epithelial cell movements, as proposed by Murray and \nOster (1984), to a calcium conservation equation. \n194 G.C. Cruywagen et al.\nRecently, Cruywagen and Murray (1992) proposed a novel model to \naccount for the tissue interaction that leads to feather germ patterning in chick \nskin. In this paper we show that their model can similarly produce a contrac- \ntion wave propagating through the epithelial ayer. At this stage we only \nconsider the one-dimensional version of the model. Waves in two-dimensions \nare quite different. \nIn Sect. 2 we present a brief review of the tissue interaction model and \nreduce it to an ordinary differential equation system by transforming into \ntravelling wave coordinates. In Sect. 3 we carry out a linear analysis of this \nordinary differential equation system and find conditions on the model \nparameters under which travelling wave solutions may be possible. A regular \nperturbation approximation to the travelling wave solutions i  obtained in \nSect. 4 while, in Sect. 5, these perturbation solutions are compared with the \nnumerical solutions of the system of ordinary differential equations and also \nto the system of partial differential equations. From the perturbation analysis \nand numerical results we make some biological interpretations and predic- \ntions; these are discussed in Sect. 6. \n2. The model \nHere we briefly describe the tissue interaction model and refer the reader to \nCruywagen and Murray (1992) for full details. (For more details about \nmodelling tissue interaction in general see Murray et al., 1993). The model \nassumes that tissue interaction between the epithelial and dermal skin layers is \nmediated by two signal chemicals which are secreted, respectively, in each \nlayer and diffuse across the basal amina which separates the layers. It consists \nof seven equations: four to describe the production, degradation, and diffusion \nof the chemicals within and between layers; two conservation equations for \nthe dermal and epidermal cell densities, and finally, a force balance quation \nfor modelling stresses in the epithelium. As the chemical equations are stan- \ndard, we shall not describe them here but will, instead, focus on the force \nbalance and cell density equations. \nThe epithelium is modelled as a visco-elastic continuum at low Reynolds \nnumber in which active traction forces exerted by the epidermal cells are \nbalanced by elastic restoring forces and external elastic tethering to the basal \nlamina. The force balance quations then has the form \nV'~-  -f11V2,1~-[-~2(O-f12V20 ) + Ul~ + #2~-~I+ v = pu,  (2.1) \nwhere u (x, t) is the displacement a time t of a material point in the epithelium \nwhich was initially at position x, 0 = V.u is the dilation, e = \u00bd(Vu + Vu r) is \nthe strain tensor, where T denotes the transpose, and s (x, t) is the concentra- \ntion of the signal chemical produced in the dermis. The parameters E and v are \nYoung's modulus and Poisson's ratio respectively, while #1 and ]~2 are the \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 195 \nepidermis \nbasal lamina \ndermis \nFig. 1. A schematic diagram of the tissue interaction model of Cruywagen and Murray \n1992. Dermal cells, n, secrete asignal chemical s, which diffuses into the epithelial layer. This \nchemical increases the traction produced by the epithelial cells N. The chemical eis secreted \nby epithelial cells and diffuses into the dermis, where it acts as a chemoattractant fordermal \ncells \nshear and bulk viscosities respectively, I is the unit tensor, and fl, and f12 \nreflect long-range lastic stresses (see Murray 1989). For algebraic simplicity \nonly, we have assumed here that the traction z is a linear function of the \ndermal signal chemical, rather than the more complicated non-linear form \nused in Cruywagen and Murray (1992). \nWe assume that the epidermal cells move only due to convection, hence \nthe epidermal cell density, N(x ,  t), satisfies the conservation equation \n0N t3u \n- V .  N - -  (2.2) \n~t ~t \" \nThe conservation equation for dermal cell density, n (x, t), accounts for diffu- \nsion, mitosis, and chemotaxis towards the signal chemical produced in the \nepithelium. Hence, the dermal chemotaxis equation is \n0n \n- -  = DV2n - ~V\" nVe+ rn (h - n) , (2.3) \nOt \nwhere D is the coefficient of diffusion, e the chemotaxis coefficient, e(x, t) the \nconcentration of the signal chemical produced in the epithelium, and r and \nfi are positive constants (see Fig. 1 for a schematic diagram of the interaction \nmechanism). \nWe can linearise about the uniform steady state of N, say ]V, and integrate \n(2.2) to obtain a linear relationship between N and 0, namely N = N(1 - 0). \nUsing this and assuming that the cell kinetics occur on afast timescale one can \nfind actual algebraic expressions for the signal chemicals. From these expres- \nsions, in particular s = n\/(1 + v(1 - 0)) and e = (1 - 0)\/(1 + 7\"), we observe \nthat the active traction stress in the epidermis is induced by high concentra- \ntions of dermal cells, but inhibited by high concentrations of epithelial cells. \nSimilarly, dermal chemotaxis occurs towards high concentrations of epithelial \ncells, but is inhibited by high concentrations of dermal cells. \n196 G.C. Cruywagen et al. \nWhen nondimensionalised, the system takes the form, in one-dimension, \nO30 ~20 fl ~40 92 { \"~l'l } \nP&---~x 2+~x 2 -  ~x  4+~x 2 l+v( l - -O)  =PO'  (2.4a) \nOn \nt?t - ~?x 2 e~xx[ ~xx \\1~-~]  J + n(1 -- n), (2.4b) \nwhere #, fl, z, v, p, e and 7 are positive parameters. \nThe tissue interaction in these caricature quations is represented in (2.4a) \nby the fourth term on the left-hand side, in which cell traction in the epidermis \nis a function of dermal cell density, and in (2.4b) by the second term on the \nright-hand side in which dermal cell chemotaxis  a function of the dilation in \nthe epidermis. \nTo analyse the system for travelling waves we look for solutions in the usual \nway by setting z = x + ct, where the constant c is the positive wavespeed. We \nare thus concerned with waves moving in the negative z-direction. With this \nchange of variables (2.4) converts to the following system of ordinary differen- \ntial equations in z, where n and 0 are now functions of z, \ndaO d20 - d40 d2 { n } \n+ - + + 1 v(1 -0 )  =P0 '  (2.5a) \nC-~z dZn ~-~z n-~z ~ + n(1 - n) (2.5b) \nNote that if we set c~ = 0, which is equivalent to ignoring epidermal to dermal \ninteraction, (2.5b) decouples from (2.5a) and is, in fact, the well studied Fisher \nequation which exhibits travelling wave solutions with wavespeed c __> 2 (see, \nfor example, Fife 1979, Murray 1989). \n3 Linear analysis : \nTo prove the existence of travelling wave solutions for the two-way tissue \ninteraction system (2.5) is a non-trivial task, since one has to deal with \na six-dimensional phase space. However, using a linear analysis about the \nsteady states, we can conjecture under which conditions a trajectory corres- \nponding to a travelling wave solution will be possible. \nThe tissue interaction system (2.5) has the steady states 0 = 0, n = 0 and \n0 = 0, n = 1. Realistic waves require a heteroclinic orbit in n, connecting the \nsteady state n = 0 to n = 1, and a homoclinic orbit in 0, connecting the steady \nstate 0 = 0 to itself. By setting \n0o=0, 01=0', 02=0\", 03=0'\", no=n, nl=n', \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 197 \nwe can rewrite the coupled pair of ordinary differential equations (2.5) as \na sixth order system, namely \n0~ = 01 , (3.6a) \n01 = 02, (3.6b) \n0~ = 03 , (3.6c) \nOr3 = cO 3 \"~ 02 - -  t000 ~- ~ [cr(anx + Vno02) + 2zvOt(anl + vnoOa)] , (3.6d) \n' (3.6e) gl 0 ~ n 1 , \n1 \n{~2[cnl + no(no - 1)] - c~7n1(1 - 0o) - c~((01nl + \nn'x = (2 + ~Tno(1 - 0o) no02)  \n2~Tnonl } \n[(0x + 7na(1 - 0o)] , (3.6f) + \nwhere \ntr = 1 + v(1 - 0o), ( = 1 + yno,  \nand the expression (3.6f) for n'l must be substituted into (3.6d). \nWe now investigate whether a trajectory connecting the steady state \nSo = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) to the steady state $1 -- (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0) is possible. As in \nthe simpler Fisher case, we will show that the steady state So has an unstable \nmanifold and the steady state $1 has a stable manifold. \nFirst, we linearise about the trivial steady state So and, in the usual way, \nlook for solutions of the form Ae ~z, where the vector A is a constant and the \nsign of N2 determines the stability of the steady state. Substituting this into \nthe linearized system leads to a system of six simultaneous homogeneous \nequations. A non-trivial solution for this system exists only if2 satisfies a sixth \norder polynomial, which includes as solution, the complex conjugate pair \nc _+ x \/cS -  4 \n4o+ - 2 ' (3.7) \nwith the eigenvectors of the form \n[to, t\u00a22o _+, t\u00a22o 2 +, X2o 3+, 1, 4o _+ ] (3.8) \nwhere \nz(CRo + - 1) \nK= \n(1 + .)(B2o'_+ -  c2o - 22 + + p)  \nThe four other eigenvalues 2 ,  i = 1, 2, 3, 4 satisfy \nf12 4 - -  ~C2 3 - -  2 2 \"q- p = 0 , \nwith eigenvectors of the form \n[a, 2.  0, 0] .  \n(3.9) \n(3.1o) \n198 G.C. Cruywagen et al.\nBy integrating (2.5b) with respect o z and imposing appropriate boundary \nconditions (see Sect. 4), we can easily show that c > 0. Hence the steady state \nSo will always have a linearly unstable manifold (from (3.7)) spanned by the \neigenvectors corresponding to the positive eigenvalues in (3.7) and (3.9). \nBiologically the dermal cell density no is non-negative. Since the eigen- \nvector (3.8), corresponding to the eigenvalue with the positive real part in (3.7), \nhas an imaginary ni-component if c < 2, such unrealistic trajectories are \npossible. However, ifc > 2 then no > 0 on all trajectories originating from So, \nsince the eigenvectors (3.8) will have real nl-components. Thus, similar to the \nFisher equation, for realistic travelling wave solutions for the reduced tissue \ninteraction model there is a lower bound on the wavespeed. \nWe can also derive a linearly valid condition on the model parameters for \ndetermining when the epithelial cell dilation solution will exhibit oscillatory \nbehaviour in the vicinity of So. Using Descartes' rule of signs, since all the \nmodel parameters, as well as the wavespeed c are positive, it follows that the \npolynomial (3.9) has either two or zero positive and either two or zero \nnegative roots. To determine the three turning points (3.9) we set its first \nderivative qual to zero and solve for 2 to obtain \n2\" = 3\/~c + x\/9\/.t2c 2 - 32fl and 2* = 0. \n88 \nBy substituting 2* into the polynomial (3.9), we find the condition under \nwhich it will have two real positive roots, that is \n3 \n512pfl 3 -- 27\/,4c 4 -- 144fl#2c 2 -- 16fl - -  #c(9122c 2 q- 32fl)~ < 0.  (3.11) \nUnder this condition the eigenvalues in (3.9) with positive real part are real \nand therefore oscillatory behaviour in the model variable about So will not \noccur. However, if condition (3.11) is not satisfied then the imaginary eigen- \nvalues in (3.9) have positive real parts. In this case oscillatory trajectories in \n0 could shoot from the steady state So. \nLinearising about the steady state $1 we find eigenvalues \n(1 + 7)cw +_ ~\/(1 + \u2022)2C2W2 \"q- 4(1 + 7)W \n2+ = 2 , (3.12) \nas well as the four roots satisfying \nwhere \nand \nf12 4 -  pc2 3 - (2 2 + p = O, \n1+7 \nw (1 +7) 2+c~7 >0 '  \n\"rv \n= 1 + (1 + v) - - - - -~  \n(3.13) \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 199 \nIt is easy to see from (3.12) that $1 always has a stable manifold for positive \nvalues of c. Since the eigenvalues (3.12) have no imaginary parts there will be \nno oscillation in cell density n, in the vicinity of the steady state. \nFurthermore, as the polynomial (3.13), according to Descartes' rule of \nsigns, has two or zero negative roots we can again find a linearly valid \ncondition under which the dilation solution 0, would not approach the zero \nsteady state solution in an oscillatory manner. Using a similar method as \nbefore we can find the condition as \n3 \n512pfl 3 -- 27~4c 4 -- 144fl(p2c 2 -- 16fl~ 2 -t- #c(9~2c 2 + 32(fl)g < 0.  (3.14) \nIf this condition is violated oscillatory trajectories in 0 in the vicinity of $1 are \npossible. \nFrom the above analysis we conjecture that a biologically realistic travel- \nling wave, connecting the steady states So and S~ for all parameter ranges \ncould exist if c > 2. In the following sections we shall examine by analytical \nand numerical means whether such travelling wave solutions actually do exist. \n4 Regular perturbation solution \nIn this section we find a regular perturbation solution for the travelling wave \nsolutions of the tissue interaction system (2.5). For the purpose of our per- \nturbation method we assume that there does indeed exist a travelling wave \nsolution for (2.5) satisfying the boundary conditions \nlim n(z) =1, lim n(z) =0, lira O(z) =O'(z) =O\"(z) =O\"'(z) =n'(z) =0.(4.15) \nZ --~ oO z~- -oo  z~ +o0 \nWe begin by rescaling the system of ordinary differential equations (2.5). To \nfind the appropriate scalings we rescale the dependent and independent \nvariables in (2.5) by setting \nO = 2;-10, N = ~bn, ~ = fiz, (4.16) \nwhere O, N and ~ are the rescaled variables, 6 is an appropriate scale for the \nindependent variable and Z and q~ are appropriate scales for the dependent \nvariables. \nSince we have no a priori reason for favouring one term above another we \ntry to employ a scaling which simplifies (4.15) the least, that is, which makes as \nmany terms as possible in the relevant differential equation have the same \norder of magnitude. \nUsing (4.16) gives, for (2.5a), after multiplying by 2;, \n3Z d30 2Z d20 4- d40 +.r~2~) d2 ~'ld~Z( N ZO)~=p~O \" j  \n+v(1- \n(4.1\"1) \n200 G.C .  Cruywagen et al. \nWe find here that it is impossible to make all the terms the same order of \nmagnitude, since there are five terms but only three free parameters (X, q~ \nand 6), and we are forced to favour some terms above others. \nTo ensure that we have a non-zero solution for this equation at the lowest \norder we must assume that the interaction term, in which n(z) appears, is in \nthe lowest order equations. Biological considerations suggest that the viscous \nand long range elastic terms, the first and third terms in (4.17), respectively are \nnot as important as the short range lastic term and the epithelial tethering \nterm, the second term and the term on the right hand side of (4.17), respectively. \nWe therefore assume that the interaction and the tethering terms are of the \nsame order of magnitude, thus setting 62\"~(~ = p\u2022. This determines a unique \nrelationship between 6 and Z which would be violated if we assume other \nterms in the equation are also of the same order. Alternatively, one could \nassume that the elastic and the interaction terms are of the same order of \nmagnitude. However, by using a similar procedure as we do below, exactly the \nsame perturbation solutions for n and 0 result. \nBy using the scaling (4.16), where ~b = 1, (2.5b) becomes \nc6~ 2 d2N 2 d ( d \/ 1 - SO \\ )  \nwhich is the Fisher equation with an interaction term included. Here again we \nhave to favour some terms above others. Murray (1977) gives a perturbation \nsolution for the normal Fisher equation in terms of the small parameter 1\/e z, \nby assuming that ~b = 1 and that the term on the left hand side of the equation \nis the same order of magnitude as the logistic growth term on the right hand \nside. We make the same assumption for our interaction system, thus setting \nca = 1. From now on we shall again use n instead of N. \nSo, if we assume that \n1 z \n8=- ,  X -  C pc 2 ' \nand set e = 6 2 we obtain the rescaled system \nd30 d20 g4 d40 d2 { n } \n\" -dU +  -dU - \/ -aU + 1 + v(1 - = pO.

Hence, we use a regular perturbation method to obtain approximate \nsolutions to this system with e as our small parameter. Although e is relatively \nlarge when the wavespeed has minimum value c = 2, a similar method gives \nvery good perturbation solutions to the Fisher equation (see Murray 1977). \nWe therefore assume that the solution of (4.18), satisfying the boundary \nconditions (4.19) and (4.20), can be written as a series expansion of the form \no(\u00a2 ,e )  = 00(4) + ~o, (\u00a2 )  + . . .  (4.21a) \nn(~,~) = no( i)  + ~nl(~) + . . . .  (4.21b) \nSubstituting (4.21) into (4.18) reduces the system of nonlinear equations (4.18) \nto a hierarchy of linear equations. The boundary conditions at ~ = _+ oo and \nthe choice of n(0) = 1\/2, which requires that n(0, e) = 1\/2 for all e, lead to the \nfollowing conditions on Oi(~) and rti(~) ,\nlim Oi (~)=0,  lim O'i(~)=0, fori=0,1,2,... \nlira no(~) = 0, lim no(i) = 1, no(0) = 1\/2, \n~--, -oo ~oo \nlim ni(~)=0, n~(0)=0, fo r \/= 1,2,3 . . . . .  (4.22) \nBefore carrying out the perturbation procedure we must decide on the \nmagnitude of the physical model parameters \/~,\/~, ~, v, p, c~ and 7. As these \nparameters are difficult to measure, we scale them so that the most significant \nbiological terms have the same order of magnitude in the relevant equations. \nThis way we keep as much flexibility as possible. \nWe assume that p is O(1). If we assume that c~, y or v is O(1\/e) or larger, it \nbecomes analytically intractable to find perturbation solutions for the system. \nThus we assume that they are all 0(1). Biologically we expect he long range \nelasticity, reflected by\/~, and the viscous effects, measured by the parameter #, \nto be small and so, to insure that these effects do not dominate the short range \nelastic forces, we choose both\/ \/and\/~ to be O(1) or smaller. We also do not \nexpect he chemically induced traction force, measured by the parameter z, to \nbe larger than the restoring forces of the adhesion tethers, reflected by p, thus \np\/z is O(1) or larger. Later we shall discuss how the order of magnitude of \nthese parameters may influence the solutions. \nAt O(1) the equations are \n1 dano \n6)0 - 1 +~ d~ 2 (4.23a) \ndno \n- no(1 -- no) \u2022 (4.23b) \nd~ \n202 G.C.

Besides, the \nadditional correction provided by, say, the O(e 2) term, is too small to be \nsignificant. \nBiologically it is very difficult to measure the dilation 0, of the epithelial \nlayer. However,  since the relationship between the dilation and the displace- \nment u for the case of small strains is \ntu(x, t) \n- -  - O(x ,  t ) ,  \ngx \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 203 \nwe can find the perturbation solution in terms of the displacement u by \nintegrating the dilation function. In terms of the variable 4, we have that \ndu(4) \"r \n- -  = - - o ( 4 )  . \nd4 pc \nThe constant of integration can be set to zero if we assume that the displace- \nment at infinity is zero. Assuming that we can integrate the perturbation \nsolution for 0(4) we find that \n72 (~ 1\/2U0(4) ~- \/~ 3\/2 Ul (4) \"~- ) (4.28) u(4) p \nwhere \ne ~ \nUo(4) = \n(1 + V)(I + e\u00a2) 2 ' \n,[~ vOon'o(4) u1(4) =-~o; '  + Oo + vno(4) ~ + n'1(4) + _ _ .  \np (1 +v)2 J  1 +v  ( l+v)  2 \nFrom these expressions we see that u( - oe ) = 0, at least to 0(53\/2). Extensive \nnumerical simulation suggests that u is zero as z tends to - oo. \nHence we have found a regular perturbation solution for the system of \nordinary differential equations (2.5) when all the parameters are 0(1). The \nsolution, however, changes if the parameter values do not satisfy this condi- \ntion. We discuss this in the following two sections. \n5 Numerical solutions \nHere we solve the ordinary differential equation system (2.5) numerically and \ncompare the results with the perturbation solutions obtained in the previous \nsection. We solved (2.5) with NAG FORTRAN routine D02RAF which uses \na finite difference technique for solving boundary value problems. An initial \nestimate is corrected using Newton iteration and deferred correction. We \nspecified as initial condition the first order perturbation solutions (4.24) and \n(4.25) as obtained in the previous ection. \nThe equations were solved on the spatial domain [ -  20, 20], which is \nlarge in comparison with the part of the domain where the solution rapidly \nchanges hape. So as to satisfy the uniqueness criteria used in the previous \nsection, the numerical solutions were shifted so that n(0) = 1\/2. \nOur numerical simulations howed that biologically realistic waves occur \nonly when the wavespeed satisfied c > 2.0. In all the cases we computed with \nc < 2, the dermal cell density dropped below zero in the region of the boundary \nz = - 20. This confirms the predictions of the linear analysis of Sect. 3. \nTo find the displacement u(z), we numerically solved u'(z) = O(z) by using \nNAG FORTRAN routine D02CBF which integrates a first order, variable \nstep, Adams routine. Since we require the displacement tobe zero at _+ oe we \n204 G.C.  Cruywagen et al. \nassume as initial condition that u( - 20) = 0.0 and integrated to z = 20. The \nnumerical solution of O(z) was calculated at discrete mesh points by the finite \ndifference routine. Since the Adams routine requires the value for O(z) at \nintermediate points we used NAG FORTRAN routine E01AAF to interpo- \nlate the value of O(z) at the z-values required by the Adams routine, using the \nfour closest mesh values of 0. This routine uses Aitken's technique of success- \nive linear interpolations. \nWe illustrate our numerical results with two examples for different values \nof the wavespeed c.\nExample 1. We assumed that all our parameters are O(1) so that we can \ncompare our numerical solution with the regular perturbation solution. We \ntherefore set\/~, fl, z, v, p, ~ and 7 all equal to 1.0. It was further assumed that \nthe wave travels at minimum speed, c = 2.0, as predicted by the linear analysis \nof Sect. 3. For such a low value of the wavespeed c, the value of the small \nparameter e in our perturbation expansions (4.21) is relatively large. \nThe numerical solution is compared with the zero and first order analyti- \ncal approximations in Fig. 2.

The parameters are as in Example 1 \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 205 \nslightly by adding the 0(5) term. The bend appearing in the solution at z = 0 is \ndue to the O\" and O'\" terms in our perturbation solution which are relatively \nlarge at the origin, see Fig. 3. \nExample 2. Here we used the same parameter set as in Example 1, but we \nincreased the wavespeed to c = 3 so that e = 1\/9. With the first order terms \nincluded the perturbation solution and numerical solution are almost iden- \ntical, see Fig. 4. \nIn both examples considered above, the linear non-oscillatory conditions on \n0 in the vicinity of the steady states, (3.11) and (3.14), were satisfied. As \nexpected the dilation solution approached the steady states smoothly. How- \never, we also considered some examples with parameter sets so that conditions \n(3.11) and (3.14) were violated. In these cases the dilation solution 0 changed \nsign as it approached the steady states, suggesting a possible oscillatory \nbehaviour. \nThe full partial differential equation system (2.4) was solved numerically \nusing NAG FORTRAN routine D03PGF, which discretises the spatial deriv- \natives and solves the resulting system of ordinary differential equations using \nGear's Method. We imposed zero flux boundary conditions. For the initial \nconditions we refer again to the Fisher case. The velocity of the travelling \nwavefront for the classical Fisher equation depends on the initial conditions. \nKolgomoroff et al. (1937) proved that if the initial conditions atisfy \n{loifX>x2 (5.29, \nn(x, O) = i f x<x l '  \nwhere xl < x2 and n(x, 0) is continuous in the domain (xl, x2), then the \nsolution of the Fisher equation evolves to a travelling wavefront solution with \nminimum speed c = 2.0. We conjecture that this result also holds for our \nsystem. \n\u00b0'18~ \u00b0\"11 eo OolOo,1\/  eo \n\u00b0'\u00b0'l\/\\ , \u00b0'\u00b0l] \n-~0 -i5 -i0 ~ 15 2\"o -i0 -is -z0 \nZ \n-o .~]a  -o.le \n\"-\"~015 20 \nZ \nb \nFig. 3a, b.

The parameters are as in Example 2 \nIt is also known that for initial data other than the above, the wavespeed of \nthe Fisher equation depends critically on the behaviour of n(x, 0) as \nx ~ _+ oo. To find the dependence of the wavespeed of our system on the \ninitial conditions at infinity, analysis similar to that proposed by Mollison \n(1977) for the Fisher equation is used. \nWe consider the leading edge of the evolving wave. Here, since n and 0 are \nsmall, we linearize the dermal cell equation to \nOn ~32n \n& c3x2 + n ,  (5.30) \nwhich is similar to the linearized version of the Fisher equation at the leading \nedge. Assume that the initial condition in dermal cell density is \nn(x ,O)=Ae \"x as x--, -oo  , \nwhere A and a are positive arbitrary constants. We look for travelling wave \nsolutions atisfying (5.30) and of the form \nn(x,  t) = Ae  a~x +c') , \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 207 \nwhich represents the leading edge of the wavefront solution of the nonlinear \nequation. Substituting this expression into the linear equation (5.30) gives the \ndispersion relation \n1 \nc = a +- .  (5.31) \nG \nSo, for a = 1, the wavespeed c takes the minimum value 2. For all other \npositive values of a, c is larger than 2. \nNow consider min[e \"x, e x] for x large and negative. I fa  < 1 then e \"x > e x \nfor x < 0 and therefore the velocity of propagation will depend on the leading \nedge of the wave and the value of c is given by (5.31). On the other hand if \na > 1 then e ax is bounded from above by e x and thus the wavefront with speed \nc=2.

Time evolution of the travelling front at intervals of unit time when parameters \nare as in Example 3and initial conditions as in (5.29). The wave velocity, c = 2.0, is as \npredicted by the linear analysis \n208 G.C. Cruywagen et al. \nWe now use this result to construct initial conditions for the numerical \nsimulations. \nSolving the partial differential equation system with parameter values as in \nExample 1 and initial conditions (5.29), excellent agreement was obtained with \nthe solution of the system of ordinary differential equations (2.5). As expected, \nwe found that the wave solution did indeed travel at minimum speed c = 2.0. \nExample 3. Here we solve the partial differential equation system with the \nmost realistic parameter set \n1 1 # = 0.1, fl = 0.01, z = 1.0, v = g, p = 15.0, ~ = 1.0, 7 = g \u2022 \nWe have chosen fl to be very small since we expect he long range elastic forces \nin the mechanical balance equation to be small. As before we assumed that \nn(x, 0) satisfies (5.29). As expected, a wavespeed c = 2.0, was obtained (see \nFig. 5). This confirms the predictions made from the analysis of Sect. 3. \nExample 4. We use the same parameter set as in the previous example, but set \nour initial conditions o that a wavespeed c = 5.2 is expected. According to \n(5.32) this means that the initial conditions at the leading edge must be of the \nform n(x, 0) = e sx. To simulate this numerically the dermal eading edge was \nperturbed accordingly after each numerical iteration. (We assumed the lead- \ning edge to be the region where the dermal cell density is less than 0.1). \nA wavespeed c = 5.2 was indeed obtained. \n6 Discussion \nFrom a biological point of view it is important to examine the roles which the \nvarious parameters play in determining the shape and size of the respective \nwaves. The regular perturbation solution obtained in the previous section \nlends itself particularly well to such an exercise as it is possible to predict he \nqualitative role of some of the model parameters from the perturbation \nsolution. It is also relatively easy to confirm these predictions by numerical \nstudies. \nWe begin by investigating how the epidermal contraction wave is in- \nfluenced by the adhesion tethers with which the epidermal sheet is connected \nthrough the basal amina to the dermal layer. For large values of p, the sheet is \nfirmly attached and the dermal travelling wave causes a very small disturb- \nance in the epithelial layer. This is apparent from the scaling (4.16) we used, \nsince by increasing p the value of Z decreases. On the other hand, decreasing \nthe value of p has the opposite effect - the amplitude of the epithelial \ncontraction wave increases. \nIt is interesting to note that when we do not have epithelial tethering, \nthat is, p is zero, two constants appear when we integrate the epidermal \nequation, (2.4a), \n60 \n~-~ + 0 + 1 + v(1 - 0 ) -  ko(t)x + k~(t). \nTravelling waves in a tissue interaction 209 \nThis equation does not possess travelling wavefront solutions with constant \nspeed and shape. Due to the terms on the right hand side, the equation does \nnot convert into an ordinary differential equation in terms of z after the usual \nsubstitution z = x + yr. \nChanging the traction parameter, z  has a similar effect as changing p. For \nexample, by decreasing the epithelial traction parameter z, the value of the \nscaling parameter r in (4.16) decreases and so does the size of the epithelial \ncontraction wave. \nThe value of the viscosity parameter, p similarly influences the amplitude \nof the epithelial contraction wave. When \/~ is very large, say O(1\/e2), the \nviscous nature of the epithelial sheet dominates the elastic properties. The size \nof the contraction wave decreases accordingly, since now our 0(1) perturba- \ntion solution is Oo = 0. On the other hand, by decreasing the viscous para- \nmeter, #, to say 0(~), the #O~' term, see Fig. 3b, in our 0(~) solution (4.26) \ndisappears. The disturbance in the leading edge of the dilation wave therefore \nincreases while that in the trailing edge decreases. The change in the solution, \nhowever, would be very small, since decreasing p only effects the first and \nhigher order terms in our perturbation solution. \nHence the results obtained here lead to several biological predictions. To \nsummarize: a change in epithelial viscosity, traction and\/or adhesion influen- \nces the amplitude of the contraction wave. \nThese predictions could be tested experimentally. For example, by induc- \ning a travelling wave in the dermal ayer one could then examine the epider- \nmal layer for a disturbance wave as seen in the solutions considered above. \nA dermal cell density wave could, for example, be initiated by injecting \na mitotic promoter at one end of the developing skin. One could then \ninvestigate whether the amplitude of the epithelial wave increases if, say, the \ntethers, with which the epithelial layer is attached to the dermal ayer, are \nsevered. Such an experiment could also indicate whether the dermal- \nepidermal interaction is chemical or mechanical. \nBiologically it is believed that the whole pattern formation process in \nmorphogenesis is the result of a few simple mechanisms. In Cruywagen et al. \n(1992) we showed that this tissue interaction mechanism could generate \nsynchronous and sequential spatial patterns in one- and two-dimensional \ndomains. (See also Cruywagen et al. 1993, where the pattern is shown to \ndepend on initial conditions.) Here, we have illustrated that tissue interaction \nmodels can exhibit travelling wave solutions in one-dimension. Our simula- \ntions also show that the model can exhibit travelling wave solutions which \nleave behind a spatial pattern (Cruywagen et al. 1994). The versatility of this \nmechanism thus lends additional support o the key role of tissue interaction \nin morphogenesis. \nAcknowledgements .
