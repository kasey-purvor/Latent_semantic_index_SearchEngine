Fizeau configurations therefore offer \nthe combined advantages of optimised SNR and down-lead insensitivity, indicating their \nsuitability for use in relatively poorly-controlled environments such as in-vivo \nmeasurements. \n 1. Introduction \nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is a low-coherence scanning technique used to \ndetermine the sub-surface refractive-index structure of transparent [1],[2] or turbid [3],[4] \nmaterials with a resolution, dependent upon source coherence length, of between about 1 \nand a few tens of m\u03bc  [5],[6]. In biological tissue samples the penetration depth of the \nilluminating radiation is typically 1-2 mm [7], and the technique is therefore of interest in \nstudying changes in surface tissue layers, e.g identification of pre-cancerous changes in \nthe tissue layers of the skin [8] or oesophagus [9]. \n[insert figure 1 about here] \nThe most widely used configuration for fibre-optic based OCT is a Michelson \ninterferometer formed from a directional coupler (figure 1), in which either an external \nmirror or the polished (and sometimes coated) end of one coupler output fibre generates \nthe reference reflection [10],[11]. This is mixed, using appropriate lenses at the fibre \noutput, with light backscattered from a sample positioned close to the other coupler \noutput arm. The path length difference between the interferometer arms is scanned \nlinearly with time. \nWhen a source of low temporal coherence is used to illuminate the system, interference \nfringes are observed only when the path length difference at any point in time is less than \nthe coherence length of the source. Thus a plot of the variation in fringe magnitude seen \nduring a scan represents the variation of the backscattered signal from different depths \nwithin the sample. The spatial resolution perpendicular to the sample surface is of the \norder of the coherence length. A single scan produces a one-dimensional map of \nrefractive-index variation as a function of sample depth. By repeating the depth scan over \na grid of positions on the sample surface, a two- or three-dimensional map of subsurface \nstructure is obtained [12]. Various types of rapid scanning techniques have been \ninvestigated to reduce the time taken for acquisition of a three-dimensional image \n[13],[14].  \nThe Michelson arrangement for OCT is widely used. Other configurations based on \nMach-Zehnder interferometers have been suggested, all resulting in very similar values of \nSNR to the Michelson configuration, when used with balanced detection [15]. However, \nboth the Michelson and Mach-Zehnder configurations have disadvantages. The signal and \nreference beams travel in different arms of the directional coupler. They therefore \nexperience differential polarisation state changes as a result of physical perturbation of \nthe fibre introducing birefringence, and differential phase changes caused by variations in \nambient temperature around the fibre arms. Periodic fading or loss of the interference \nsignal is experienced if the states of polarisation are mismatched in the region where \ninterference occurs [16]. Under laboratory conditions, such changes are typically slow \nand can be reduced by the inclusion of polarisation-state controllers in the system [17], \nalthough regular adjustment of the relative polarisation states is likely to be necessary. \nWhen an OCT system is required to make clinical measurements including internal \ninvestigations, control over ambient conditions is much more difficult and polarisation \nmismatches can become more troublesome. Several approaches to reducing the problem \nare possible: it is possible under favourable circumstances simply to make measurements \nonly when the polarisation states are well matched. However, this can lead to \nmeasurement artefacts being missed if ambient conditions change significantly during the \ncourse of a measurement. \nAnother alternative is to construct the interferometer using polarisation-preserving fibres \nand fibre components [18]. This is a satisfactory solution when the sample is non-\nbirefringent. For linearly polarised light, coupled into an eigenmode of the interferometer \nfibre, the state of polarisation (SOP) is preserved throughout. However, if the sample \nitself causes depolarisation, then the SOP of the backscattered light will no longer be \npreserved within the fibres and, once again, signal fading will occur. \nA more robust solution, and the one proposed in this paper, is to employ a completely \ndifferent interferometer configuration, which is insensitive to changes in ambient \nconditions. A Fizeau-based configuration [19] is considered here which, in its most basic \nform, makes use of a single arm of the same type of directional coupler used for the \nMichelson system. The sample is now positioned close to the output arm and, again using \nappropriate optics, light is focused into the sample and the backscattered light is \nrecoupled into the illuminating fibre. The reference beam, however, is now formed from \nthe reflection at the glass\/air interface corresponding to the termination of the distal end \nof the same fibre arm, in a Fizeau interferometer arrangment (figure 2). \n[insert figure 2 about here] \nThe advantage of this system is that, apart from the section of path length within the \nsample itself, the interferometer, which is formed between the fibre end and the sample, \nis entirely free-space. The delivery fibre provides a common path for the reference and \nsignal beams, so that any polarisation changes that occur are the same for both interfering \nbeams. This gives the system immunity to polarisation variation caused by ambient \nchanges, and is known as \u2018down-lead insensitivity\u2019.  \nFor a birefringent sample, variations in signal intensity will occur, but these are now a \nfunction only of the sample birefringence, and are no longer connected with random \npolarisation drifting in the fibres as in the Michelson configuration. They can be made \nuse of to extract information about the magnitude and orientation of sample birefringence \n[20]. \nThe basic form of the Fizeau\u2013based OCT system shown in figure 2 makes poor use of the \navailable light; it can be seen from the figure that 75% of the power from the source is \nlost in the system. This configuration also suffers from the severe drawback that the \nmaximum theoretical signal-to-noise ratio for a given source and detector is much lower \nthan that for the Michelson\u2013based system [21]. This may be the reason why Fizeau-based \nOCT has not previously been investigated. However, as discussed below, the use of \noptical circulators and novel processing configurations can restore the theoretical SNR to \na value comparable with that for the Michelson configuration, with the added advantage \nof down-lead insensitive operation. \n \n2. Theory of signal-to-noise-ratio calculation \nThe received optical power in an OCT system is usually low. Broadband, infra-red solid-\nstate sources are generally used because they allow good tissue penetration and depth \nresolution. However, the output powers available from these devices are typically no \nmore than a few tens of milliwatts, and reflectivity values at tissue interfaces are small. \nThus optical power levels at the detector fall typically in the nanowatt to microwatt range. \nIdeally, systems are operated at high bandwidth to enable fast scanning and rapid \nacquisition of images. The combination of low power and high bandwidth means that the \nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in OCT is likely to be relatively low for standard detection \ntechniques, and that careful consideration will have to be given to system design. The \nvalue of SNR must exceed that required to resolve the small refractive index variations \n(around 0.01-0.1) typical of biological tissue [22] . \nThe maximum SNR of an OCT system [15] is defined as the ratio of the mean square \nsignal photocurrent 2sI from the detector, under path-matched conditions, to the total \nphotocurrent variance 2i\u03c3 . The SNR calculations in section 3 make use of the optical \npower Pr in the reference beam, power Ps in the sample beam and the optical power Px of \nstray incoherent light at the detector. Corresponding power reflectivities Rr, Rs and Rx are \nalso used and the responsivity \u03c1 of the detector is required. For maximum fringe \nvisibility, the states of polarisation of interfering beams must be identical, or reductions in \nSNR will occur. This paper assumes unpolarised light from the source.  Although this is \nnot always the case experimentally, it is a valid assumption for the purpose of comparing \nthe maximum expected SNR for a range of proposed interferometer configurations. \nThe mean square signal photocurrent is a function of the optical powers in the reference \nand signal beams and of the detector responsivity.  \nThere are three sources of noise to be considered in calculating the SNR of any OCT \nsystem. The first is receiver noise, which arises due to the random thermal motion of \nelectrons within the detection\/amplification components. For commercial photodetectors, \nthe receiver noise is usually specified by the manufacturer. \nThe two other sources of noise are both dependent upon the average photocurrent Idc at \nthe detector or, in the case of balanced detection, detectors. Shot noise arises as a result of \nthe random distribution in arrival times of photons at the detector from a monochromatic \nlight source. The shot noise photocurrent variance 2sh\u03c3 that results from this Poisson \nprocess is given by \nBqIdcsh 2\n2 =\u03c3 , (1)\nwhere q is the electronic charge and B the detection bandwidth [23] . \nThe final source of noise to be considered is excess photon noise, which arises due to the \nrandom arrival of photons from a broad band light source. This is a Bose-Einstein \nprocess, with different statistics from shot noise, and the photocurrent variance for the \nexcess noise [24] is given by \n\u03bd\u03c3 \u0394= \/22 BIdcex . (2)\nHere, \u0394\u03bd is the frequency linewidth of the source. \nWhen a balanced receiver can be used, much of the excess noise has identical time \ndependence in both detectors, and is therefore cancelled. The dominant remaining noise \ncontribution at moderate optical powers is often shot noise, and the resulting \nimprovement in SNR can be as much as 40 dB. However, in some configurations there \ncan be a phase difference between the beams arriving at the two detectors for stray, \nincoherent beams arising from unwanted reflections [25]. In this situation, the beating \nthat occurs between non-coherent spectral components of the broadband source gives rise \nto a form of noise called beat noise. The beat noise is given by \n\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u0394= \/22 BPP rxbe . (3)\n \n3. Calculated SNR for selected OCT configurations \nThe SNR 22 \/ isI \u03c3 is calculated for selected optical fibre OCT configurations, using a \nconstant set of assumed values for the required parameters as follows: Rx= 0.0005, Rr= \n0.1, \u03c1 = 0.95 A\/W, receiver noise = 2pA\/\u221aHz, source power P0 = 20 mW, wavelength \u03bb= \n1300 nm and source bandwidth = 50 nm. The electrical bandwidth, B=1 MHz. These \nparameters have been selected to be identical to those chosen by Rollins and Izatt [15], to \nallow comparison with the SNR analysis they use for their interferometer configurations. \nHowever, in calculating the average photocurrent, Rollins and Izatt assume the power \nbackscattered from the sample Ps to be negligible compared with the reference power, \neven though the sample reflectivity of Rs= 1 is an order of magnitude higher than the \nreference reflectivity of Rr= 0.1. The additional term makes a significant contribution in \nthe calculations of shot noise and excess noise. We assert, therefore, that it should be \nincluded, and we therefore obtain lower theoretical values of SNR than Rollins and Izatt \nfor the same configurations. However, the general conclusions about the benefits of \nbalanced detection are unaffected, as can be seen from the analysis below. \nIn each case, we calculate the SNR under the assumption Rs=1, which corresponds to a \n100% mirror as the sample. This is not intended to represent a realistic biological sample \nreflectivity, but gives a basis for comparison of the various configurations. For \ncompleteness, the SNR is also calculated in each case using a more realistic sample \nreflectivity value. As an example, values of relative permittivity have been published for \nbovine bronchus tissue, giving 1.96 for the submucosa and 2.1025 for the epithelium at \n1550 nm [22], leading to a reflectivity of 0.00031 [19]. For simplicity, a value of \nRs=0.001 is used here in the sample calculations. The reference reflectivity of Rr= 0.1, \nchosen to match that in the set of parameters used by Rollins and Izatt, is higher than the \nvalue of 0.04 expected for the glass\/air interface at a cleaved fibre end. However, it is \npossible to obtain values of reflectivity up to about 0.3 at a fibre end by the application of \na titanium dioxide coating to the cleaved face [26], so the value of Rr= 0.1 used is readily \nachievable. \n \n3.1 Michelson interferometer with a single detector \nThe most widely used optical-fibre configuration for OCT measurements is still the \nMichelson interferometer. The sample is positioned at the output of one interferometer \npath, and the reference surface at the output of the other. Consider first a system using a \nsingle detector, as shown in figure 1. The calculation here assumes that the splitting \nelement is a directional coupler with a split ratio of \u03b1. Ignoring losses in the system, the \npowers received at the detector from the sample arm, reference arm and unwanted \nreflections respectively are: \n2\n0 )1))(1(( xss RRPP \u2212\u2212= \u03b1\u03b1  , (4a)\n))1(( 0 \u03b1\u03b1 rr RPP \u2212= , (4b)\n)1(0 \u03b1\u03b1 \u2212= xx RPP . (4c)\nThe interference term produces a periodic signal photocurrent sI , which varies  \ncosinusoidally as the interferometer phase \u03b8  is scanned linearly. \n[ ] \u03b8\u03b1\u03b1\u03c1 cos)1()1(2 2\/122220 xsrs RRRPI \u2212\u2212= , (5)\nand the average photocurrent is given by dcI , where \n)( xsrdc PPPI ++= \u03c1  \n      = [ ]xrxs RRRRP ++\u2212\u2212 20 )1(())1(( \u03b1\u03b1\u03c1 . \n \n(6)\nCalculating the shot noise and excess noise from these expressions, a value of SNR is \nobtained which turns out to be almost independent of the split ratio \u03b1 over a very wide \nrange, for values of \u03b1 between about 0.05-0.95. A graphical representation of the results \nis shown by line (a) in figure 3(i). The maximum SNR is obtained for \u03b1=0.5. This is a \ntypical result; it turns out that for all configurations examined below, the optimum split \nratio is 0.5 and there is generally a rather weak dependence of SNR on the split ratio. \n[insert figure 3 about here] \nA graph of the SNR as a function of Rs for this configuration is shown as line (a) in figure \n3(ii). Assuming Rs = 1 results in a SNR of 62 dB, while assuming Rs = 0.001 gives a \nreduced SNR of 52 dB. A maximum value of 67 dB occurs for a sample reflectivity of \n0.1. This is to be expected intuitively since the reference and signal intensities are \nmatched at this value, and all signal light contributes to the generation of interference \nfringes. \n \n3.2 Michelson interferometer with balanced detection \nConsider now the modified configuration shown in figure 4, with an optical circulator \nincluded to allow balanced detection [15]. This is a process whereby the signals from two \nmatched detectors, positioned to monitor both outputs of the Michelson interferometer, \nare subtracted; a scheme which doubles the magnitude of the interference signal while \nsuppressing much of the noise. \n[insert figure 4 about here] \nThe use of balanced detection in this configuration has three important effects: \n(a) The magnitude of 2sI  increases by a factor of 4. \n(b) The total noise variance is doubled, as the noise appears on each of the two detectors. \n(c) The excess noise is cancelled, though this term must be replaced in the calculations by \nthe beat noise term, which corresponds to the component of excess noise not removed by \nthe balanced detector. \nWhen these modifications are introduced, the calculated values of SNR increase \nsignificantly, as shown by lines (b) in figures 3(i) and 3(ii). This is largely due to the \ncancellation of the excess noise. Shot noise now makes the dominant contribution to the \noverall noise variance, although the beat noise component also becomes more important \nfor values of Rs lower than about 0.01. \nThere is some dependence of SNR upon the chosen value of \u03b1 in this configuration, \nthrough the beat noise term, and a maximum value of 94dB is obtained for Rs= 1, at \u03b1 = \n0.5. The SNR remains above 90dB for values of \u03b1 between 0.1 and 0.9. \nWhen the lower value of Rs= 0.001 is taken, a maximum SNR of 73 dB is obtained, again \nfor \u03b1 = 0.5. Varying the reference reflectivity now has little effect; the balanced detection \narrangement reduces the sensitivity of the system to differences between signal and \nreference power. \n \n 3.3 Fizeau configuration using directional coupler, with Michelson processing \ninterferometer and a single detector \nThe simplest form of Fizeau-based OCT system, shown in figure 2, uses a single \ndirectional coupler [9],[21] . In this arrangement, there is no advantage in a variable \nsplitting ratio, so we assume a 50\/50 split ratio. Calculation of the interference term is \nnow more complicated, as interference can only occur between beams that are path-\nmatched (to within the source coherence length) after their passage through both Fizeau \nand processing interferometers. \nAssuming a lossless 50\/50 beam splitter in the Michelson interferometer, we denote the \nlonger beam path in the Michelson by the suffix a, and the shorter path by the suffix b. \nThe powers at the detector are then given by the equations: \n16\/))1(( 0 srsbsa RRPPP \u2212== , (7a)\n16\/)( 0 rrbra RPPP == . (7b)\nOnly two of these four components, Psb and Pra, are path-matched at the detector, \ntherefore the interference term is given by \n[ ] [ ] \u03b8\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1 cos)1(\n16\n2cos2\n2\/12\n0\n2\/1\nrrsrasbs RRRPPPI \u2212== . (8)\nThe average photocurrent is  \n[ ]rrsdc RRRPI +\u2212= 20 )1(()8(\u03c1 . (9)\nCalculation of the SNR for this configuration leads to values of 56 dB when Rs= 1 and 46 \ndB when Rs= 0.001. The dependence of SNR on Rs is very similar to the single-detector \nMichelson case, as seen from the graph in figure 5(a). Calculated SNR values  are about 6 \ndB lower than the values obtained for the single-detector Michelson configuration. The \nsignal reflectivity for which the maximum SNR is obtained will depend on the conditions \nassumed. In this case, the maximum SNR of 61 dB is obtained when Rs= 0.1. \n[insert figure 5 about here] \n 3.4 Fizeau configuration using optical circulator, with Michelson processing \ninterferometer and a single detector \n \nThis is very similar to case 3.3 above, the only difference being improved use of optical \npower. The use of an optical circulator, as shown in figure 6, allows all the light from the \nsource to be transmitted to the sample and all backscattered light from the sample to be \ntransmitted to the processing interferometer. \n[insert figure 6 about here] \nIf losses in the circulator are ignored, then: \n[ ] \u03b8\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1 cos\n16\n)1(2cos2\n2\/12\n02\/1 \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1 \u2212== rrsrasbs RRRPPPI , \n \n(10)\n[ ]rrsdc RRRPI +\u2212= 20 )1(()2(\u03c1  (11)\nand the SNR values are unchanged from case 3.3 since the dominant excess noise term is \nproportional to the mean square signal. Line (a) in figure 5 therefore again represents the \nvariation of SNR for this configuration. Varying the split ratio of the beam splitter in the \nreceiving interferometer of this configuration has an insignificant effect upon the values \nof SNR obtained. \n \n3.5 Fizeau configuration using a 4-port optical circulator, with Michelson processing \ninterferometer and balanced detection \n \nAs with the Michelson configuration, the use of balanced detection in this configuration, \nshown in figure 7, has three main effects: \n(a) The magnitude of 2sI  increases by a factor of 4. \n(b) The total noise variance is doubled, as the noise appears on each of the two detectors. \n(c) The excess noise is cancelled. Although the contribution of any remaining beat noise \nto the total photocurrent variance must be considered, there are in this configuration no \nfibre ends within the Michelson processing interferometer to give rise to significant \nspurious reflections. The fibre end reflection within the Fizeau interferometer is in this \ncase used as the system reference beam and therefore no longer contributes as a source of \nunwanted noise. \n[insert figure 7 about here] \nIf we can simply set the beat noise term to zero, the SNR is very straightforward to \ncalculate, resulting in values of 94 dB for Rs=1 and 74 dB for Rs=0.001. The form of the \nSNR dependence on Rs, shown as line (b) in figure 5, is now identical to that for the \nbalanced Michelson configuration. The maximum SNR is obtained when Rs=1, and \ndeclines rapidly when this reflectivity falls below 0.1. These values demonstrate that the \ninclusion of an optical circulator and balanced detection in the system design raise the \nmaximum theoretical SNR of the Fizeau-based OCT system to a level identical to that for \nthe more widely used Michelson configuration. \n \nIn practice, the configuration of figure 7 is not easy to align. Because both beams from \nthe interferometer must be re-coupled into the fibre output port of the circulator, there \ntends to be a large loss factor at this point in the system, which degrades the SNR \nseverely. The substitution of a Mach-Zehnder processing interferometer, as discussed in \nthe set of configurations below, eases the practical alignment problem and provides \nimmediate access to the complementary interferometer outputs for balanced detection. \n \n3.6 Fizeau configuration using optical circulator, with Mach-Zehnder processing \ninterferometer and single detector \n \nThe SNR is calculated for both single- and balanced-detection versions of the system \nshown in figure 8, using paired mirrors at 90o as the scanning element in the processing \ninterferometer. A single scanning mirror normal to the beam direction, together with a \nbulk-optic circulator at this corner of the Mach-Zehnder interferometer could replace the \nmirror pair. \n[insert figure 8 about here] \nIf the split ratio of the first beamsplitter in the system is \u03b1\/(1-\u03b1) and the two possible \nbeam paths through the Mach Zehnder are denoted by the suffices 1 and 2, we obtain four \nexpressions for optical power at the detector. \nFor a single detector: \n2\/))1(( 01 \u03b1srs RRPP \u2212= , (12a)\n2\/)1)()1(( 02 \u03b1\u2212\u2212= srs RRPP , (12b)\n2\/01 \u03b1rr RPP = , (12c)\n2\/)1(02 \u03b1\u2212= rr RPP .

(14)\nThe calculated SNR in this situation (figure 5(a)) is identical to that for the comparable \nidealised Michelson processing system, at 56 dB when Rs=1 and 46 dB when Rs=0.001, \nwith a maximum value of SNR=60 dB when Rs=0.1. There is a slight falling off of the \nSNR for an asymmetric split ratio of the beam splitter, but for \u03b1 between 0.1 and 0.9, the \nvalue does not fall by more than 4 dB. \nWith balanced detection, the usual differences in the terms are seen, and the SNR values \nare much higher, at 94 dB for Rs=1 and 74 dB for Rs=0.001. Once again, these are \nidentical to the values obtained using a Michelson processing interferometer (figure 5(b)). \nAs for the single detector, a slight falloff in SNR occurs if the beamsplitter has an \nasymmetric splitting ratio. \nThe calculated SNR values for all the above configurations are collected together in table \n1, for ease of comparison. \n[insert table 1 about here] \nFrom inspection of the table, it is clear that the theoretical SNR of the ideal standard \nMichelson and Fizeau configurations, using balanced detection, turns out to be identical. \nThe practical difficulties associated with constructing the Fizeau\/Michelson combination \nare, however, likely to reduce the experimental value found for this configuration \nsignificantly. \n \n4. Discussion \nThe theoretical SNR values for the basic forms of both Michelson- and Fizeau-based \nOCT systems, using a directional coupler and a single detector, are similar, though the \nvalue for the Michelson-based system is slightly higher. The experimental difficulty in \nrecoupling beams from the processing interferometer into fibre for the Fizeau \nconfiguration tends to reduce the SNR still further in practice, and the Michelson \nconfiguration is therefore to be preferred when polarisation problems are not severe. \nIt is interesting that the use of a circulator alone does not, for moderate source power, \nimprove the SNR of the Fizeau configuration, since the mean square signal photocurrent \nand the noise variance are approximately proportional. For very low source powers it is \nlikely that the use of the circulator would result in some improvement. \nIn both cases, the use of balanced detection (with, in the Fizeau configuration, an optical \ncirculator), results in an increase of 30-40 dB in the expected SNR. However, the \nexperimental problem with the Fizeau configuration persists, and the calculated SNR is \nlikely to be an overestimate in this case. \nThe use of a Mach-Zehnder processing interferometer in the Fizeau configuration greatly \neases alignment. The two complementary outputs are automatically available from this \ntype of interferometer, facilitating the use of balanced detection and avoiding the \nrequirement to recouple from the interferometer into fibre. The theoretical SNR for this \nconfiguration is in fact identical to that for the Michelson configuration with balanced \ndetection, at 94 dB for Rs=1 and 74 dB for Rs=0.001. Since alignment of the \nFizeau\/Mach-Zehnder configuration is relatively straightforward, we suggest that the \nadditional advantage of down-lead insensitivity obtained with this version of the Fizeau \nOCT system makes it a good candidate for measurements when polarisation variation \nmight otherwise be a problem. \n \n5. Conclusions \nA number of optical-fibre Fizeau-based OCT configurations have been proposed and the \ntheoretical maximum SNR value for each configuration has been calculated under a \nstandard set of assumed illumination and detection conditions. Comparison of the various \ndesigns shows that, although the basic Fizeau OCT system has poor SNR compared with \nthe more usual Michelson configuration, the use of optical circulators and balanced \ndetection can ensure an SNR comparable with that of the corresponding Michelson \ninterferometer. \nThe possibility of constructing a Fizeau-based system with good SNR is relevant in \nclinical OCT, since this configuration offers the advantage of down-lead sensitivity, \ngiving it immunity to environmental perturbations, which are likely to occur during in-\nvivo measurements. The widely used Michelson configuration, conversely, can suffer \nfrom polarisation-induced signal fading under similar conditions. \nThe Fizeau configurations outlined above use relatively slow mechanical scanning of a \nmirror to vary the optical path difference. However, it would be possible in any of the \nsystems shown to replace the scanning mirror with a fast-scan element e.g. a grating- \nbased phase control delay line [14]. \n \nAcknowledgments \nHelen Ford acknowledges a Daphne Jackson Research Fellowship, funded by the Royal \nAcademy of Engineering.
