In contrast to\nthe work of Berger @S. D. Berger and D. R. McKenzie, Philos. Mag. Lett. 57, 285 ~1988!#, C60 fullerite is used\nin this work as the standard since highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ~HOPG! is highly anisotropic, and can\ntherefore lead to preferential orientation effects in EELS. It was found that C60 had a shoulder on the high-\nenergy side of the 1s\u2192p* peak, which was centered at 287 eV. In theory, many Gaussian peaks can be fitted\nto the near edge structure ~NES! of the energy-loss spectrum. In practice, we show that only three, centered at\nenergies of 285, 287, and 293 eV, are necessary for semiquantitative analysis. The 285 eV peak is indicative\nof the sp2 bonding fraction; the second peak at 287 eV is attributed to molecular structure within the sample;\nthe third at 293 eV is determined by sp3 bonding contributions in the sample. We show that by fitting these\nthree peaks to C60 fullerite and evaporated amorphous carbon ~a-C!, that the a-C has a 0.99 sp2 bonding\nfraction compared with the C60 fullerite standard. The importance of considering the 287 eV peak in highly sp2\nbonded amorphous carbon is further illustrated by analysis of a-C:H:N thin films.INTRODUCTION\nAmorphous carbon films often comprise a combination of\ntwo types of bonding: namely, sp2 and sp3 type hybridiza-\ntions. The bonding can be analyzed by studying the K ion-\nization edge in an electron-energy-loss spectrum ~EELS!. A\nmethod for quantifying the sp2 bonding fraction in an amor-\nphous carbon film is described by Berger and McKenzie,1\nwhere the area of the 1s\u2192p* peak of the film is compared\nto that of graphite. The mathematical principle of quantifying\nthe edge is to obtain a ratio of the two areas, one of which is\nthe standard as shown in the following formula:\nf p*5\nIp*\nu DEs\nIp*\ns DEu\n, ~1!\nwhere f p* is the ratio between the two p* peaks, Ip* is the\nintegral of the 1s\u2192p* transition, and DE is the integrated\ncounts for the normalizing energy window. The superscripts\ns and u denote the standard and unknown spectra, respec-\ntively.\nUnfortunately, there are two ambiguities in the Berger\nmethod. First, what form of carbon should be used as the\nstandard? Secondly, what sort of fit can be applied to the p*\npeak ~i.e., Gaussian, Lorentzian, or a mixture of the two!? In\nthis paper, we address both of these issues.\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nAll the carbon samples in this study were analyzed on a\nVG HB601UX FEGSTEM operating at 100 keV, with a 3.4PRB 620163-1829\/2000\/62~19!\/12628~4!\/$15.00\u00c5 diameter probe. A 70 mm objective aperture having a con-\nvergence angle of 21.3 mrads and a 500 mm collector aper-\nture having a collection angle of 3.4 mrads were used in the\nmicroscope alignment. The FEGSTEM was equipped with\nthe Gatan model 666 parallel EELS spectrometer, with the\nphotodiode array operating at 0.3 eV\/channel for the collec-\ntion of K ionization edge spectra. This gives a spectral en-\nergy resolution of 0.7\u20130.8 eV when considering the spread in\nthe data of the zero loss peak. Data processing was carried\nout using Gatan EL\/P 3.0 software, where each spectrum had\nthe background and plural scattering removed, and then the\nenergy resolution was enhanced by a zero loss peak decon-\nvolution routine. The HOPG and C60 fullerite samples were\nprepared for EELS analysis by ultrasonic vibration in pure\nethanol for ten minutes. A drop of the graphite flake suspen-\nsion was then placed on a lacey carbon grid and the ethanol\nallowed to evaporate. This TEM specimen preparation\nmethod produced 10 nm thick flakes of HOPG in random\norientations, thus allowing the HOPG to be analyzed both\nperpendicular and parallel to the basal plane. The C60 sus-\npension was also placed on a lacey carbon grid, allowing the\nanalysis to be performed on C60 fullerite crystals that were\noverhanging a void. The lacey carbon film on the grid was\nanalyzed as an example of a highly sp2 bonded a-C sample\n~as it is obtained from evaporation of graphite!.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe method of quantification1 of the near edge structure\n~NES! requires a standard, as it is based on using the ratio of\nthe normalized 1s\u2192p* to 1s\u2192s* peak integral of the12 628 \u00a92000 The American Physical Society\nPRB 62 12 629BRIEF REPORTSsample to that of the standard. Therefore, the standard should\nusually be 100% sp2 bonded. There are only two realistic\ncontenders which satisfy this criteria. Namely, highly ori-\nented pyrolytic graphite ~HOPG! or C60 fullerite. Figure 1\nshows the orientation effects of HOPG of the EELS spec-\ntrum. It can be seen in Fig. 1~a! which is an EELS spectrum\nobtained parallel to the graphite layers, that there is a signifi-\ncant amount of peak overlap with the two Gaussians that are\nfitted to the p* and s* peaks at 285 and 292 eV, respec-\ntively. This overlap does not occur when the sample orien-\ntation is such that the c axis of HOPG is parallel to the\nelectron beam, as shown in Fig. 1~b!. This is due to the much\nsharper features in the spectrum and a much reduced p*\npeak. These effects make HOPG less than ideal for use as a\nstandard for K-edge EELS characterization of amorphous\ncarbon.\nC60 fullerite, on the other hand, does not suffer from these\npreferential orientation effects and is close to 100% sp2\nbonded due to its nearly pure p character.2 C60 is not exactly\n100% sp2 due to the bowing introduced into its structure by\nthe pentagonal carbon rings, which changes the s bonding\ncharacter compared to that of a graphite sheet structure.\nHowever, it does not influence the nature of the p bonding in\nthe C60 compared to that of graphite, as confirmed by Mar-\ntins, Troullier, and Weaver.2 In the case of amorphous car-\nbon films we believe this to have minimal effect on the cal-\nculated sp2 fractions calculated by analysis of the 1s2p*\nenergy loss feature taking C60 as the standard. This is be-\ncause the s bonding within the amorphous carbon film too\nwould be three-dimensional ~instead of planar as in graph-\nite!, and therefore a similar change in \u2018\u2018s\u2019\u2019 like nature of the\ns bonding would be expected. Therefore, we believe that the\nerror in the EELS analysis due to any additional influence of\nthe 1s2s* energy loss peak on the 1s2p* due to pentago-\nFIG. 1. The C K-ionization edge spectra of HOPG, ~a! normal\nand ~b! parallel to the c axis.nal rings in the C60 standard compared to that of a-C, with\nclose to 100% randomly oriented sp2 bonds is minimal. It is\nperhaps worth noting again that it is the relative intensities\nand areas of the p peaks which are important in calculating\nthe sp2 fraction using Eq. ~1!.\nModel calculations3 of the bond hybridization in C60 con-\nfirm that the p bonds remain largely unaffected by their di-\nrectional \u2018\u2018randomization\u2019\u2019 in the sphere geometry. There is\nonly a very small amount of s-character introduced into the\np bonds. The s bonds however, were found on average to be\nsp2.5 hybridized in C60 compared to the sp2 hybridization in\ngraphite. In the EELS measurements this difference in the\nhybridization of sigma bonds will not be evident in the rela-\ntive intensity of the 1s2s* peak compared to that of the\n1s2p* peak. The fractions of s bonding per carbon atom\nand pi bonding per carbon atom remain the same in C60 as in\na \u2018\u2018randomized\u2019\u2019 graphitic structure. The position of the 1s\n2s* on the energy axis may of course be shifted in C60\ncompared to that of graphite due to the differences in hybrid-\nization. But, the important parameter in our use of C60 for\ncalibration of the relative fraction of p bonding per carbon\natom in amorphous carbon is the relative intensity of the two\npeaks.\nThe computer fitting of a Gaussian or Lorentzian or a\nmixture of the two to energy loss spectra ~see for instance,\nWan and Egerton4! can be carried out according to a stan-\ndard procedure. The Gaussian peak fitted to the p* peak of\nHOPG in Fig. 1~b! shows that there is no overlap between\nthe p* and s* peaks, i.e., the p* peak has no contribution\nfrom the s* peak. HOPG can therefore be a very good base\nfor a sp2 bonded carbon system with a Gaussian fitted to the\np* peak centered at 285 eV. However, this is only strictly\napplicable when there is an orientation effect within the car-\nbon, which is the same as that of the HOPG standard film\nbeing analyzed.5 Figure 2~a! is the K edge spectrum of C60\nfullerite. A Gaussian or Lorentzian peak fitted at 285 eV will\nnot model correctly the shape of the edge due to a shoulder\non the high-energy side of the p* peak. This problem is not\nnew since Silva et al.6 reported that the peak fitting to the\nspectra from a-C:H films could be improved if a third Gauss-\nian peak was introduced at 287 eV. The physical origin of\nthis third Gaussian peak was thought to be associated with\nthe shift of the 1s\u2192p* peak due to hydrogen bonding to\nsp2 carbon.6 By adding a third peak at 287 eV, a good fit to\nthe C60 spectrum edge @shown in Fig. 2~a!# can also be ob-\ntained. The problem here is that C60, in common with\nHOPG, is purely sp2 bonded carbon without any bonded H.\nAlso, HOPG does not require a third peak @Fig. 1~b!#, there-\nfore, an explanation as to why C60 should need a third peak\nat 287 eV is required. Figure 2~b! shows the K edge spec-\ntrum of hydrogen free evaporated a-C, which also requires a\nthird peak to be fitted at 287 eV. Unlike Silva,6 who attrib-\nuted this peak to hydrogen bonding within the film, in our\ncase it occurs in pure sp2 carbon films, which have no ori-\nentation effects. It is plausible to postulate that this third\npeak at 287 eV may be due to indirect transition from the 1s\nto p* state. The work of Pickard et al.7 on ab initio calcu-\nlations of the near edge structure ~NES! for the graphite K\nedge suggests that as the angle of incidence of the fast elec-\ntron changes in relation with the graphite c axis, the 1s\n12 630 PRB 62BRIEF REPORTS\u2192p* peak decreases in size and simultaneously gains a\nshoulder on the high-energy side of the peak. Pickard pro-\nposed that a family of peaks should be considered until the\nonset of the 1s\u2192s* transition at 289 eV. Further calcula-\ntions by Pickard and Payne8 on the NES of diamond shows\nthat the 1s\u2192s* transition is also made up from a large\nnumber of such peaks. Therefore, the size and shape of the\n1s\u2192s* edge will influence the size and shape of the 1s\n\u2192p* peak if there is some residual overlap between them.\nThe 1s\u2192p* peak will also change with the angle of the p\nbonds in relationship to the incident direction of the fast\nelectron. It is therefore clear that the NES of the carbon\nionization edge is determined by a number of factors, and to\nmodel the NES satisfactorily a number of Gaussian peaks\nhave to be considered. Figure 1~a! shows that the 1s\u2192p*\npeak has a slight shoulder on the high-energy side. This\nshoulder is due to the angle of the incident electron beam.\nThe angular effect however, is not enough to cause the\nshoulder seen in the C60 fullerite spectrum @Fig. 2~a!#. C60 is\na molecule in which the character of the p bonding is the\nsame as that of graphite, but with random orientation, for this\nreason we can discount mixing of the p and s states giving\nrise to the 287 eV peak. The 287 eV feature is also required\nto fit the spectrum obtained from a-C. Electron energy loss\nspectroscopy of cyclic hydrocarbons, fluoroethenes, and 1,3\nperfluorobutadiene9\u201311 have shown that all these molecules\nhave a peak with varying strengths at around 287 eV. It was\nconcluded that this peak was due to a molecular transition,\nwhich varied in intensity, depending upon the intramolecular\nbond length.\nThere is much work reported in the literature on the NES\nof C60 based on x-ray absorption spectroscopy ~XAS,\nNEXAFS! and dedicated high resolution EELS without any\nFIG. 2.

Interestingly, they too\nreport the observation of a peak approximately 2 eV above\ntheir 1s\u2192p* peak ~but in their case the 1s\u2192p* peak is at\n;284 eV!. We believe the peak we observe on our C60\nsample at 287 eV on the STEM-EELS with its superior\nnanometer scale spatial resolution, which allows for chemi-\ncal mapping, is a \u2018\u2018smudged\u2019\u2019 reproduction of the fine struc-\nture reported in these papers.\nAdditionally, Treacy and Gibson15 has shown that\nparacrystalline domains exist in group IV amorphous mate-\nrials. It is therefore possible that within the a-C film there are\nsmall paracrystalline domains which give it some heteroge-\nneous properties. These small domains in turn could be\nviewed as being pseudomolecules within an amorphous ma-\ntrix. If this were the case, then we could expect that the 287\neV peak would be higher for C60 than for a-C, as C60 fullerite\nis a truly molecular crystal, whereas a-C is only paracrystal-\nline.\nUsing Eq. ~1! with C60 as the standard, and defining the\npeaks at 285 and 287 eV as shown in Fig. 2, values of f p*\n50.99 and f 28750.86 are obtained for a-C. This indicates\nthat while the a-C analyzed is almost entirely sp2 bonded,\nthe relative influence of transitions to molecular-like states\nascribed to the 287 eV feature is significantly reduced. The\nassociation of the 287 eV peak being with a molecular tran-\nsition is further reinforced by the fact that it is not present in\nthe EELS K-edge NES of diamond or graphite.\nFurther evidence of the importance of properly account-\ning for the influence of the 287 eV peak when determining\nthe sp2 bonding fraction, was seen in the EELS analysis of\nhydrogenated and nitrogenated amorphous carbon ~a-C:H:N!\nfilms. These films were obtained using the capacitively\ncoupled radiofrequency plasma enhanced chemical vapor\nFIG. 3.

Details of the particular deposition pa-\nrameters used can be found in the literature.16 They were\nprepared for EELS by releasing thin electron transparent\nfilms from a Si substrate using an HF etching procedure. The\nsp2 bonding fraction determined without taking into account\nthe 287 eV peak is plotted as a function of nitrogen ~N! flow\nin Fig. 3. The sp2 bonding fraction appears to start at a\nfraction close to 100% for films with a low nitrogen content,\nand then monotonically reduces to around 60% as the N\ncontent increases. This is clearly in error, as it is known that\nwith increasing N content a-C:H:N films graphitize, and\nthereby increase the proportion of sp2 bonding within the\nfilms.17 The results obtained by also taking into account the\nrelative influence of the 287 eV peak from the same EELS\ndata is shown in Fig. 3. It is now observed that the sp2\nbonded fraction starts at 70% for low N content, and then\nrises to a maximum of 94% for high N content. This is much\nmore in keeping with data obtained from this class of\nmaterial.18 These results show clearly the importance of con-\nsidering the 287 eV peak when analyzing amorphous carbon\nfilms with high sp2 bonding fractions using EELS K-edge\nNES.\nThe relative strength of the 287 eV peak in these films,\ncompared to that of C60 fullerite, shows a distinct drop at\nhigher N contents ~Fig. 3!. On the basis of the molecular\ntransition origin of the 287 eV peak, this would be expected.\nThe presence of small graphitic domains in a-C is predicted\nfrom the sp2 cluster model developed from tight-binding cal-\nculations by Robertson.19 As the films become more gra-\nphitic in character, clusters with molecularlike properties be-\n*Author to whom correspondence should be sent.\n1 S.

The loss in intensity of the 287 eV peak at high N\ncontents would then be in keeping with this model for the\nstructure of a-C.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is generally not possible to fit just one Gaussian or\nLorentzian peak to the 1s\u2192p* transition in the NES of the\ncarbon K ionization edge electron energy loss spectrum. The\nexception to this is for HOPG and CVD diamond forms of\ncarbon. When considering C60 fullerite and amorphous forms\nof carbon, a peak centred on 287 eV must be included to take\ninto account the molecular crystalline nature of C60 and\nparacrystalline nature of a-C films. It has been shown that\nthe 1s\u2192p* ~285 eV!, the molecular crystalline ~287 eV!,\nand the 1s\u2192s* ~293 eV! transitions all contribute to the\nedge shape. Therefore, all three transitions have to be fitted\nwith Gaussian peaks for the determination of the sp2 bond-\ning content within a carbon film. C60 fullerite has been\nshown to be a more suitable standard than HOPG for obtain-\ning the sp2 bonding fraction. We propose the use of the 287\neV peak to measure the relative fraction of molecular nature\nwithin carbon films.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors acknowledge EPSRC for financial support.\n~1984!.\n11 R.
