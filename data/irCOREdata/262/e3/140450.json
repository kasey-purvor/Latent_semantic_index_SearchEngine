Introduction\nContext During the last five decades, interest in High Speed Marine Vehicles\n(HSMV) has been increasing for both commercial and military use, leading to new\nconfigurations and further development of already existing configurations (Clark\net al. 2004). To create vehicles capable of carrying more payload both farther and\nfaster, many concepts have been proposed, and they can be classified analysing\nthe force that can be employed to sustain the weight of a HSMV: hydrostatic lift\n(buoyancy), powered aerostatic lift, hydrodynamic lift.\nBuoyancy is the lift force most commonly used by ships. Marine vehicles that\nexploit only buoyancy to sustain their weight are usually called displacement vessels.\nFor high speed marine vehicles it is not feasible to use only buoyancy, as in this\ncase the buoyancy force is proportional to the displaced water volume, and at high\nspeed it is better to minimize this parameter, since as more vehicle volume (and\nthe wetted surface) is immersed in the water the higher the hydrodynamic drag will\nbe.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society TEX Paper\n2 M. Collu et al.\nThe Air Cushion Vehicles (ACV) class use a cushion of air at a pressure higher\nthan atmospheric to minimize contact with the water, thus minimizing hydrody-\nnamic drag. The air cushion is not closed, and an air flux keeps the pressure in the\ncushion high. This system is called \u2018powered aerostatic lift\u2019.\nAt high speeds a marine vehicle experiences \u2018hydrodynamic lift\u2019, due to the fact\nthat the vehicle is planing over the water surface. This hydrodynamic lift supports\nthe weight otherwise sustained by buoyancy or, through increasing the speed, can\nalso replace in part or wholly the buoyancy force. Planing craft, high speed cata-\nmarans and other similar configurations use this principle to attain high speeds. If,\ninstead of a simple planing hull, a surface similar to an aerofoil is used underwater,\na hydrofoil is obtained. Basically, while in planing mode the hydrodynamic lift is\ngenerated by only one surface, the wetted surface of the hull, hydrofoils experience\nan effect similar to aerofoils, since the hydrodynamic lift is the difference between\nthe pressure acting on the lower surface and the pressure on the upper surface.\nA high speed marine vehicle can use two or all these three kinds of forces to\nsustain its weight. For example, a SES (Surface Effect Ship) consists of a catamaran\nhull configuration plus a powered air cushion with a front and a rear skirt in the\nspace between the hulls. Therefore it experiences both hydrostatic and powered\naerostatic lift.\nThere is another lift force that can be exploited to \u2018alleviate\u2019 the weight of the\nvehicle, leading to reduced buoyancy and therefore to decreased hydrodynamic drag:\nthis is aerodynamic lift. There is an extreme case where the aerodynamic forces are\nsustaining 100% of the weight of the vehicle: WIG (Wing In Ground effect) vehicles.\nA WIG vehicle is a vehicle designed to exploit the aerodynamic effect called\n\u201cwing in ground effect\u201d. Extensive literature can be found on this effect and the\nvehicles exploiting it (Rozhdestvensky 2006), and only a brief introduction is given\nhere. Given a conventional aerodynamic surface of fixed geometry, aerodynamic\nforces (lift, drag, and moment) acting on it depend on two variables: the speed of\nthe surface relative to the air, and the angle of attack, defined as the angle between\nthe chord of the wing and the speed direction. When this aerodynamic surface\noperates at a height above the surface, equal or lower than, roughly, one third of\nits span length, the aerodynamic forces experienced start to be dependent not only\non the aforementioned parameters, but also on the height above the surface. The\nquality (plus or minus) and the quantity of these changes depend on the geometry\nof the wing, but in general it can be said that, reducing the height above the surface,\nwith other parameters fixed, increases lift and decreases drag, leading to enhanced\naerodynamic efficiency.\n\u2018Aerodynamically Alleviated Marine Vehicles\u2019 (AAMV)\nAn Aerodynamically Alleviated Marine Vehicle (AAMV) is a high speed marine\nvehicle designed to exploit, in its cruise phase, aerodynamic lift force, using one or\nmore aerodynamic surfaces.\n2. Problem Statement\nThis work illustrates a mathematical method to study the dynamics of an AAMV; a\nvehicle designed to exploit hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces of the same order\nof magnitude, to sustain its weight. Methodologies for aircraft and marine craft exist\nand are well documented, but air and marine vehicles have always been investigated\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nLongitudinal Static Stability of an AAMV 3\nwith a rather different approach. Marine vehicles have been studied analyzing very\naccurately hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, approximating very roughly the\naerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle. On the contrary, the dynamics of Wing In\nGround effect (WIG) vehicles has been modelled focusing mainly on aerodynamic\nforces, paying much less attention to hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces.\nAn AAMV experiences aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces of the same or-\nder of magnitude, therefore neither the high speed marine vehicles nor the airborne\nvehicles models of dynamics can cover and fully explain the AAMV dynamics. The\nmain objective of this work is to bridge this gap by developing a new model of dy-\nnamics, in the small disturbances framework, consisting of a system of equations of\nmotion that take into account the equal importance of aerodynamic and hydrody-\nnamic forces. This mathematical model is further developed to estimate the static\nand dynamic stability of an AAMV.\n3. Literature review\nThe hybrid nature of the model developed, hybrid between model of dynamics used\nfor WIG vehicles and for planing craft, is mirrored by the literature review below.\nFurthermore, a section on literature review studying vehicles that can be classified\nas AAMV is presented.\nWing In Ground (WIG) vehicles Research onWIG vehicles has mainly been\ncarried out in the former Soviet Union, where they were known as \u2018Ekranoplans\u2019.\nThe Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau, under the guidance of R. E. Alekseev, de-\nveloped several test craft and the first production ekranoplans: Orlyonok and Lun\ntypes (Kolyzaev et al. 2000).\nIn the meantime, several research programs were undertaken in the west to\nbetter understand the peculiar dynamics of vehicles flying in ground effect (IGE).\nIrodov (1970) and Rozhdestvensky (1996) made important contributions to the\ndevelopment of WIG vehicles dynamic models.\nIn the 60\u2019s and the 70\u2019s Kumar (1968a, 1968b) started research in this area\nat Cranfield University. He carried out several experiments with a small test craft\nand provided the equations of motion, the dimensionless stability derivatives and\nstudied the stability issues of a vehicle flying IGE.\nStaufenbiel & Bao-Tzang (1977) in the 70\u2019s carried out extensive work on the\ninfluence of aerodynamic surface characteristics on the longitudinal stability in wing\nin ground effect. Several considerations about the aerofoil shape, the wing planform\nand other aerodynamic elements were presented, in comparison with the experi-\nmental data obtained with the experimental WIG vehicle X-114 built by Rhein-\nFlugzeugbau in Germany in the 70\u2019s. The equations of motion for a vehicle flying\nIGE were defined, including non linear effects.\nHall, in 1994, extended the work of Kumar, modifying the equations of motion\nof the vehicle flying IGE, taking into account the influence of perturbations in pitch\non the height above the surface.\nMore recently Chun & Chang (2002) evaluated the stability derivatives for a 20\npassenger WIG vehicle, based on wind tunnel results together with a vortex lattice\nmethod code. Using the work of Kumar and Staufenbiel, the static and dynamic\nstability characteristics were investigated.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n4 M. Collu et al.\nPlaning craft Research on high speed planing started in the early twenti-\neth century for the design of seaplanes (Perring & Glauert 1932). Later research\nfocused on applications to design planing boats and hydrofoil craft. During the pe-\nriod between 60\u2019s and 90\u2019s, many experiments were carried out and new theoretical\nformulations proposed.\nSavitsky (1964) carried out an extensive experimental program on prismatic\nplaning hulls and obtained some empirical equations to calculate forces and mo-\nments acting on planing vessels. He also provided simple computational procedures\nto calculate the running attitude of the planing craft (trim angle, draught), power\nrequirements and also the stability characteristics of the vehicle.\nMartin (1978) derived a set of equations of motion for the surge, pitch and heave\ndegrees of freedom and demonstrated that surge can be decoupled from heave and\npitch motion.\nTroesch and Falzarano (Troesch 1992, Troesch & Falzarano 1993) studied the\nnonlinear integro-differential equations of motion and carried out several exper-\niments to develop a set of coupled ordinary differential equations with constant\ncoefficients, suitable for modern methods of dynamical systems analysis.\nHicks et al. (1995) later extended their previous work and expanded the nonlin-\near hydrodynamic force equations of Zarnick (1978) using Taylor series up to the\nthird order, obtaining a form of equation of motion suitable for path following or\ncontinuation methods.\nAerodynamically Alleviated Marine Vehicles (AAMV) In 1976, Shipps\nanalysed a new kind of tunnel hull race boat. The advantages of this new configu-\nration come from the aerodynamic lift. In 1978, Ward et al. published an article on\nthe design and performance of a ram wing planing craft: the KUDU II. This vehi-\ncle, which consists in two planing sponsons separated by a wing section, was able\nto run at 78 kts (almost 145 km\/h), thanks to the aerodynamic lift alleviation. In\n1978, Kallio performed comparative tests between the KUDU II and the KAAMA.\nThe KAAMA is a conventional mono hull planing craft. The data obtained during\ncomparative trials showed that the KUDU II pitch motion, in sea state 2, at about\n40 to 60 knots, was about 30% to 60% lower than the conventional planing hull\nKAAMA.\nIn 1997, Doctors proposed a new configuration called \u2018Ekranocat\u2019 for which he\nmentioned the \u2018aerodynamic alleviation concept\u2019. The weight of the catamaran was\nalleviated by aerodynamic lift, thanks to a more streamlined superstructure than in\ntraditional catamarans. The theoretical analysis and computed results showed that\na reduction in the total drag of around 50% can be obtained at very high speed,\nabove 50 knots (93 km\/h).\nIn these references some experimental data, theoretical and computed results\non vehicles which can be classified as AAMV are presented, but none of them\npresent an analysis of the static stability of a vehicle having both hydrodynamic\nand aerodynamic surfaces. This is the gap the present work is aimed to bridge.\n4. The model\nIn order to develop a mathematical model for the dynamics of an \u2018Aerodynami-\ncally Alleviated Marine Vehicle (AAMV)\u2019, a kinematics framework is proposed to\ndescribe the motion of the AAMV and the forces acting on it.

AAMV axis system\nframework is established, it is necessary to narrow down possible configurations of\nthe AAMV, since the qualitative and quantitative nature of the forces and moments\nacting on the AAMV depend on the elements that comprise its configuration.\n(a) Kinematics\nThe study of kinematics requires a definition of coordinate frames, a notation\nto represent vehicle motion and a technique for a transformation between fixed and\nmoving frames. To describe the motion of an AAMV and the forces acting on it,\na number of different axis systems are used. Starting from the axis systems used\nfor planing craft (Savitsky 1964, Martin 1978) and for WIG vehicles (Irodov 1970,\nStaufenbiel & Bao-Tzang 1977), an earth-axis system and two body-axis system are\npresented below. They are all right-handed and orthogonal, as shown in figure 1.\nDashed lines represent the vehicle in a disturbed state (rotation and displacements\nhave been emphasized for clarity).\nFor body-axis systems, the origin O is taken to be coincident with the centre of\ngravity (CG) position of the AAMV in equilibrium state. The x and z axis lie in the\nlongitudinal plane of symmetry, x positive forward and z positive downward. The\ndirection of the x -axis depends on the body-axis system. Two are considered: aero-\nhydrodynamic axes (\u03b71O\u03b73), the direction of the x -axis \u03b71 being parallel to the\nsteady forward velocity V0, and geometric axes (\u03beO\u03c2), the direction of the x -axis\n\u03be being parallel to a convenient geometric longitudinal datum (as the keel of the\nhull). Aero-hydrodynamic axes are used here as the counterpart of aerodynamic\naxes (called wind or wind-body axes in UK and stability axes in USA) used for\nairplanes. Usually the stability derivatives are calculated in this axis system.\nThe direction of the earth-axis systems (xOz) are fixed in space. The z-axis is\ndirected vertically downward, the x-axis is directed forwards and parallel to the\nundisturbed waterline and the origin at the undisturbed waterline level.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n6 M.

This approach can be applied also to the choice of the AAMV configura-\ntion. A WIG vehicle\u2019s fundamental elements are the aerodynamic surfaces and the\naero-propulsion system, while on a high speed marine vehicle the elements would\nbe hydrostatic surfaces, hydrodynamic surfaces and a hydro-propulsion system.\nDuring the course of the work, it was decided to limit the type of hydro-surfaces\nto only a prismatic planing hull (figure 2). Therefore the possible configurations\nwas narrowed down, as shown in table 1.\nThe main difference is that, with the first class of configurations, hydrofoils could\nbe represented. With the latter, only planing surfaces can be taken into account.\nAuthors considered that the AAMV should also have the capability of free flight (or\nwing in ground flight), therefore the configuration with hydrofoils as hydrodynamic\nsurfaces was not considered suitable.\nAmong all the other possible hydrostatic\/hydrodynamic surfaces, a prismatic\nplaning hull has been chosen, and the Savitsky planing hull model is used for this\nconfiguration (Savitsky 1964). The available literature on planing craft dynamics is\nextensive (Blake & Wilson 2001) and the approaches used are somewhat similar to\nthe approach used for WIG vehicles: this aspect makes the coupling of the airborne\nand waterborne dynamics simpler. Also if the majority of planing hulls used are non-\nprismatic, it has been demonstrated that the Savitsky approach is suitable also for\nnon-prismatic hulls (Savitsky et al. 2007), and in particular in the preliminary phase\nof design. To estimate the equilibrium state, the starting point of the static and\ndynamic stability analysis presented in this work, the Savitsky method is chosen,\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nLongitudinal Static Stability of an AAMV 7\nWATERLINE\n\u03be\n\u03b6\nCG \u03c4\nHC\nAC\nL\nD M\nT\nN\nD\nL\n\u03b5\nW\na1\nD\nF\nD\nws\na1 a1\na2\nM\na2\na2\nAC\n1\n2\nD\nah\naerodynamic\nhydrodynamic\nFigure 3.

The equilibrium state estimation method has been previously\ndeveloped by the authors (Collu et al. 2008, Collu 2008).\n(c) Forces and Moments acting on the AAMV\nThe forces and moments acting on the vehicle, after an external disturbance,\nare listed in table 2 and illustrated in figure 3.\nDecoupling of Equations of Motion The AAMV, represented as a rigid body\nin space, and with control surfaces fixed, has 6 degrees of freedom. To describe its\nmotion a set of six simultaneous differential equations of motion is needed. However,\na decoupled system of equations of motion can be derived. For airplanes, in the\nframe of small perturbations approach, the lateral-longitudinal coupling is usually\nnegligible. This is still valid for WIG vehicle (Chun & Chang 2002). For planing\ncraft, as demonstrated by Martin (1978), not only the lateral-longitudinal coupling\nis usually negligible, but also the surge motion can be decoupled from the heave and\npitch motion. Therefore it is assumed that the AAMV has a negligible longitudinal-\nlateral coupling. In this work, the longitudinal motion of the AAMV is analysed,\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n8 M. Collu et al.\nthus only the forces and moments acting in the longitudinal plane xOz are taken\ninto account: surge, heave forces and pitch moments. Following the nomenclature\nused for ships and airplanes, the force in the x direction is X, in the z direction is\nZ and the moment about the y axis is M.\n(d) Forces and moments expressions\nThe total force vector acting on the AAMV can be expressed as:\nF = Fg + Fa + Fh + Fc + Fp + Fd (4.1)\nwhere the components of each force are\nFi = [ Xi Zi M i ]T\nThe total force is the sum of gravitational (g) force, aerodynamic (a) and hydrody-\nnamic (h) forces, control (c) systems forces, propulsion (p) force and environment\ndisturbances (d) forces.\nWhen considering the motion of an airplane or a marine vehicle, after a small\nperturbation from a datum motion condition, it is usual to express aerodynamic\nand hydrodynamic forces and moments in Taylor expansions about their values at\nthe datum motion state. The expansion can be nonlinear and expanded up to the\nn-th order, but in this work a linear expansion will be used. The linear approach\nhas some limitations, but it is the result of a trade off. To study the dynamics\nof modern airborne vehicles, a non linear approach is used, but not in the early\ndesign phases (see, for example, Roskam 1989). In fact, in these phases a basic\nbut solid understanding of the physics underpinning the static stability of a new\nconcept vehicles is needed, and the linear approach is perfect for this task. The non\nlinear approach would unnecessarily complicate the approach, hiding important\naspects, and giving information too detailed at this stage. As regard hydrodynamic\nderivatives, linear methods are generally considered good enough to estimate the\nstatic stability boundaries (Troesch & Falzarano 1993, Hicks et al. 1995).\nAs for airplanes and planing craft, forces and moments are assumed to depend\non the values of the state variables and their derivatives with respect to time. Then,\neach force and moment is the sum of its value during the equilibrium state plus its\nexpansion to take into account the variation after a small disturbance, which is:\nF = F0 + F\u2032\nF0 = [ X0 Z0 M0 ]\nT\nF\u2032 = [ X \u2032 Z \u2032 M \u2032 ]T\n(4.2)\nwhere the subscript (0) denotes starting equilibrium state and superscript (\u2032) de-\nnotes perturbation from the datum. Initially, the AAMV is assumed to maintain\na Rectilinear Uniform Level Motion (RULM) with zero roll, pitch and yaw angles.\nIn this particular motion, the steady forward velocity of the AAMV is V0 and its\ncomponents in the aero-hydrodynamic axis system are [\u03b7\u02d91,0, \u03b7\u02d93,0], with \u03b7\u02d91,0 = V0\nand \u03b7\u02d93,0 = 0, since this is a level motion (constant height above the surface).\nControl, power and disturbances forces In this analysis, it is assumed\nthat the controls are fixed (similar to the \u201cfixed stick analysis\u201d for airplanes). Then\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nLongitudinal Static Stability of an AAMV 9\ncontrols\u2019 forces and moments variations are equal to zero. The thrust is assumed\nnot to vary during the small perturbation motion and it is equal to the total drag\nof the vehicle. The effects of environmental disturbances, like waves, are beyond the\nscope of this work; so a stable undisturbed environment is assumed.\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\nFc = Fc0\nFp = Fp0\nFd = 0\n(4.3)\nGravitational force The gravitational contribution to the total force can be\nobtained by resolving the AAMV weight into the body axis system. Since the origin\nof the axis system is coincident with the CG of the AAMV, there is no weight\nmoment about the y axis. Remembering that the equilibrium state pitch angle\nis equal to zero and the pitch angular perturbation \u03b8\u2032 is small, the gravitational\ncontribution is\nFg = Fg0 + F\ng\u2032\nFg0 = [ 0 mg 0 ]\nT\nFg\n\u2032\n= [ \u2212mg\u03b8\u2032 0 0 ]T\n(4.4)\nAerodynamic forces Usually, to evaluate aerodynamic forces and moments,\nthe state variables taken into account in their Taylor linear expansion are the veloc-\nity along the x and z axes (\u03b7\u02d91 and \u03b7\u02d93) and the angular velocity about the y axis (\u03b7\u02d95).\nAmong the accelerations, only the vertical acceleration (\u03b7\u00a83) is taken into account\nin the linear expansion. Since the dynamics of a vehicle flying IGE depends also on\nthe height above the surface, Kumar (1968, 1968b), Irodov (1970) and Staufenbiel\n& Bao-Tzang (1977) introduced for WIG vehicles the derivatives with respect to\nheight (h).\nThese derivatives can be evaluated knowing the geometrical and aerodynamics\ncharacteristics of the aerodynamic surfaces of the AAMV (Hall 1994). As shown by\nChun and Chang (2002), the Taylor expansion to 1st order (linear model) is a good\napproach to have a first evaluation of the static and dynamic stability characteristics\nof the WIG vehicle.\nThe expansion of the generic aerodynamic force (moment) in the aero- hydro-\ndynamic axis system (\u03b71O\u03b73) for a AAMV with a longitudinal plane of symmetry\nis\nFa = Fa0 + F\na\u2032\nFa0 = [ X\na\n0 Z\na\n0 M\na\n0 ]\nT (4.5)\nFa\n\u2032\n=\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 XahZah\nMah\n\uf8f9\uf8fb h\u2032 +\n+\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 Xa\u03b7\u02d91 Xa\u03b7\u02d93 Xa\u03b7\u02d95Za\u03b7\u02d91 Za\u03b7\u02d93 Za\u03b7\u02d95\nMa\u03b7\u02d91 M\na\n\u03b7\u02d93\nMa\u03b7\u02d95\n\uf8f9\uf8fb \uf8ee\uf8f0 \u03b7\u02d91\u03b7\u02d93\n\u03b7\u02d95\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\u2032+\n+\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 0 Xa\u03b7\u00a83 00 Za\u03b7\u00a83 0\n0 Ma\u03b7\u00a83 0\n\uf8f9\uf8fb \uf8ee\uf8f0 \u03b7\u00a81\u03b7\u00a83\n\u03b7\u00a85\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\u2032\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n10 M.

Fj denotes the derivative of the\nforce (or moment) F with respect to the state variable j, it corresponds to the\npartial differential \u2202F\/\u2202j.\nHydrodynamic forces In Hicks et al. (1995), the nonlinear integro-differential\nexpressions to calculate hydrodynamic forces and moments are expanded in a Tay-\nlor series, to third order. Therefore, equations of motion can be written as a set of\nordinary differential equations with constant coefficients. The planing craft dynam-\nics are highly non-linear, but the first step is to linearize the non-linear system of\nequations of motion and to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors, where variations\nare monitored with quasi-static changes of physical parameters, such as the position\nof the CG. This approach seems reasonable as a first step for the analysis of the\nAAMV dynamics too, for which a linear system of equations is developed.\nThe derivatives are usually divided into restoring coefficients (derivatives with\nrespect to heave displacement and pitch rotation), damping coefficients (derivatives\nwith respect to linear and angular velocities) and added mass coefficients (deriva-\ntives with respect to linear and angular accelerations). Martin (1978) and Troesch &\nFalzarano (1993) showed that the added mass and damping coefficients are nonlin-\near functions of the motion but also that their nonlinearities are small compared to\nthe restoring forces nonlinearities : therefore added mass and damping coefficients\nare assumed to be constant at a given equilibrium motion. Their value can be ex-\ntrapolated from experimental results obtained by Troesch (1992). For the restoring\ncoefficients, the linear approximation presented in Troesch and Falzarano (1993)\nwill be followed:\nFh, restoring \u2212 Fh, restoring0 \u223c= \u2212[C] \u03b7 (4.6)\nThe coefficients of [C] can be determined using Savitsky\u2019s method for prismatic\nplaning hull (Savitsky 1964) or the approach presented by Faltinsen (2005).\nAn approach to estimate added mass, damping and restoring coefficients is pre-\nsented by Martin (1978). Furthermore, an alternative approach is to compute the\nadded mass and damping coefficients as presented in Faltinsen (2005).\nThen the expansion of the generic hydrodynamic force (moment) with respect\nto the aero-hydrodynamic axis system \u03b71O\u03b73 is:\nFh = Fh0 + F\nh\u2032\nFh0 = [ X\nh\n0 Z\nh\n0 M\nh\n0 ]\nT (4.7)\nFh\n\u2032\n=\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 0 Xh\u03b73 Xh\u03b750 Zh\u03b73 Zh\u03b75\n0 Mh\u03b73 M\nh\n\u03b75\n\uf8f9\uf8fb \uf8ee\uf8f0 \u03b71\u03b73\n\u03b75\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\u2032+\n+\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 Xh\u03b7\u02d91 Xh\u03b7\u02d93 Xh\u03b7\u02d95Zh\u03b7\u02d91 Zh\u03b7\u02d93 Zh\u03b7\u02d95\nMh\u03b7\u02d91 M\nh\n\u03b7\u02d93\nMh\u03b7\u02d95\n\uf8f9\uf8fb \uf8ee\uf8f0 \u03b7\u02d91\u03b7\u02d93\n\u03b7\u02d95\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\u2032+\n+\n\uf8ee\uf8f0 Xh\u03b7\u00a81 Xh\u03b7\u00a83 Xh\u03b7\u00a85Zh\u03b7\u00a81 Zh\u03b7\u00a83 Zh\u03b7\u00a85\nMh\u03b7\u00a81 M\nh\n\u03b7\u00a83\nMh\u03b7\u00a85\n\uf8f9\uf8fb \uf8ee\uf8f0 \u03b7\u00a81\u03b7\u00a83\n\u03b7\u00a85\n\uf8f9\uf8fb\u2032\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nLongitudinal Static Stability of an AAMV 11\nThe superscript h denotes \u201chydrodynamic forces\u201d.

Static stability\nAnalyzing the forces and moments under the small disturbances hypothesis, the\nstatic stability of an AAMV is derived using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.\nIn particular, Staufenbiel & Bao-Tzang (1977) showed how the last coefficient\nA0 of the characteristic polynomial of a WIG vehicle can be used to estimate its\nstatic stability. In general, given the characteristic polynomial of a system:\nAn s\nn +An\u22121 sn\u22121 + . . .+A1 s1 +A0 = 0 (5.1)\nif the condition\nA0\nAn\n> 0 (5.2)\nwith An > 0, is fulfilled, the system is statically stable.\n(a) AAMV characteristic polynomial and static stability condition\nIn \u00a7 4 the mathematical model is developed to study the longitudinal dynamics\nof an AAMV. A system of ordinary differential equations of motion is derived for\nthe longitudinal plane in the frame of small-disturbance stability theory. Starting\nfrom this model, the Routh-Hurwitz condition is used to derive a mathematical\nexpression to estimate the AAMV static stability.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n14 M.

Unfortunately, no experimental data on static stability of a\nAAMV configuration is available in the public domain.\nTo plan experiments to obtain these data, it is necessary to have a physical\ninsight of the condition stated in eq. 5.2. This condition, applied to the complete\norder system in eq. 5.5, is relatively complex. Assuming that the surge degree of\nfreedom (\u03b71) can be decoupled from heave (\u03b73) and (\u03b75) pitch degrees of freedom,\na simplified version of the condition in eq. 5.5 can be obtained, leading to a better\nphysical insight.\nThe mathematical model of the dynamics here developed starts from the sys-\ntems of equations of motion for WIG vehicles and planing craft. As regards the\ndynamics of a planing craft, Martin (1978) demonstrated that the surge motion\ncan be decoupled from the heave and pitch motion. For the dynamics of WIG ve-\nhicles, Rozhdestvensky (1996) proposed a reduced order system where the surge\nmotion is decoupled from heave and pitch motion.\nBy defining the reduced order state space vector \u03bd as\n\u03bd =\n[\n\u03b7\u02d93 \u03b7\u02d95 \u03b73 \u03b75 \u03b70\n]T (5.8)\nthe Cauchy standard form (or state-space form) of the reduced order system is\nobtained.

Referring to \u00a7 4.11, remembering that\nthe superscript \u2018a\u2019 stands for aerodynamic and \u2018h\u2019 for hydrodynamic, and that Z is\nthe heave force (positive downward) and M the pitch moment (positive bow up),\nthe coefficients are equal to:\nA33 = Aa33 +A\nh\n33 = \u2212Za\u03b7\u00a83 \u2212 Zh\u03b7\u00a83\nA35 = Aa35 +A\nh\n35 = \u2212Za\u03b7\u00a85 \u2212 Zh\u03b7\u00a85\nA53 = Aa53 +A\nh\n53 = \u2212Ma\u03b7\u00a83 \u2212Mh\u03b7\u00a83\nA55 = Aa55 +A\nh\n55 = \u2212Ma\u03b7\u00a85 \u2212Mh\u03b7\u00a85\n(5.11)\nC33 = Ch33 = \u2212Zh\u03b73 , Ca33 = 0\nC53 = Ch53 = \u2212Mh\u03b73 , Ca53 = 0\nD30 = Da30 = \u2212Za\u03b70 , Dh30 = 0\nD50 = Da53 = \u2212Ma\u03b70 , Dh50 = 0\n(5.12)\nThe aerodynamic derivatives can be estimated with the approach presented in Hall\n(1994) and the hydrodynamic derivatives with expressions presented by Martin\n(1978) and by Faltinsen (2005). Using these expressions for the configuration pre-\nsented in \u00a7 4b we have\n(A55 + I55) (m+A33)\u2212A53 A35 > 0 (5.13)\ntherefore, since the denominator of eq. 5.10 is greater than zero, the static stability\ncondition of the reduced order becomes\nD50\nD30\n\u2212 C53\nC33\n> 0 (5.14)\nSimilarity with WIG vehicles To better understand the condition expressed\nin eq. 5.14, a parallel with WIG vehicles static stability criteria is illustrated.

Remembering that\npositive abscissa means ahead of the CG, the condition in eq. 5.15 and 5.16 can be\nexpressed as (Rozhdestvensky 2006):\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n16 M.

Author propose for the second term the name \u2018hydrodynamic centre\nin heave\u2019, so that eq. 5.17 can be also expressed as:\n\u201cthe hydrodynamic centre in heave should be located downstream of\nthe aerodynamic centre in height.\u201d\nAs before, dividing the hydrodynamic lift due to a heave variation (\u2206Lhyd) from\nthe lift due to a variation of the height above the surface (\u2206Lheight), it needs to be\nchecked that the point of action of \u2206Lhyd is located upstream the point of action\nof \u2206Lhyd.\n(c) Reduced order system static stability: graphical insight\nTo better understand conditions expressed in eq. 5.17, a graphical representa-\ntion of the aerodynamic centre in height, the aerodynamic centre in pitch and the\nhydrodynamic centre in heave is given in figure 4.\nFor a conventional aircraft the longitudinal static stability, without considering\nthe influence causing a change in the aerodynamic control surfaces (the so called\n\u2018fixed stick analysis\u2019), is determined only by the position of the \u2018neutral point 1\u2019,\ncalled the \u2019aerodynamic centre in pitch\u2019. This point can be imagined as the point\nwhere the aerodynamic forces, due to an external disturbance of the pitch angle,\nact. To have an airplane statically stable, the aerodynamic centre in pitch should\nbe located rearward with respect to the CG, and the distance between the neutral\npoint 1 and the CG is called static stability margin (ssm1), since it is a measure of\nhow statically stable the airplane is.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nLongitudinal Static Stability of an AAMV 17\nFor wing in ground effect vehicles there is an additional neutral point, designated\n\u2018neutral point 2\u2019, due to the fact that aerodynamic forces depend also on the height\nof the vehicle above the surface. As stated by Staufenbiel & Bao-Tzang, Irodov and\nothers, to have a statically stable WIG vehicle, it should fulfill the condition \u2018neutral\npoint 1 rearward of the CG\u2019 plus another condition: the neutral point 2 should be\nlocated upstream with respect to the neutral point 1. The distance between the\ntwo neutral points can be assumed as a second static stability margin, indicated as\nssm2.\nFor an aerodynamically alleviated marine vehicle a third neutral point exists,\ndue to the fact that the forces depend on: (a) the pitch angle as for airplane and\nWIG vehicles, (b) the height above the surface as in WIG vehicles, and (c) on the\nheave position. In fact hydrodynamic forces depend heavily on the heave position of\nthe AAMV. Furthermore, the condition expressed in eq. 5.17 is represented here by\nthe fact that \u2018neutral point 3\u2019, also called \u2018hydrodynamic centre in heave\u2019, is located\ndownstream with respect to the \u2018neutral point 2\u2019, also called aerodynamic centre\nin height. As for previous cases, the distance between the neutral point 2 and the\nneutral point 3 can be assumed as a measure of the static stability margin in heave\n(ssm3). The condition for the AAMV static stability is derived using the reduced\norder system of equations of motion, following an approach already used for WIG\nvehicles. It should be noted that it is useful for the preliminary design phase of the\nvehicle and to have a quick physical insight of the static stability of a AAMV.\n6. Conclusions\nIn the last few decades, interest in high speed marine vehicles (HSMV) has been\nincreasing, leading to several new configuration concepts. Among these, the \u2018aerody-\nnamic alleviation concept\u2019 (Doctors 1997) consists of using one or more aerodynamic\nsurfaces to alleviate the weight of the marine vehicle. Basically, the advantages are:\n(a) a total drag, at high speed, up to 20-30 % lower than the same marine vehicle\nwithout aerodynamic surfaces (Collu 2008), (b) vertical and angular pitch accelera-\ntions, at high speed, 30-60% lower than conventional HSMV (Kallio 1978), and (c)\na vehicle bridging the speed gap and payload gap between conventional high speed\nmarine vehicles and airplanes.\nTo classify this configuration concept, the new abbreviation AAMV, \u2018Aerody-\nnamically Alleviated Marine Vehicle\u2019 is used. Being a relatively recent configuration\nconcept, it lacks a specifically developed mathematical framework to study its dy-\nnamics. The AAMV experiences aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces of the same\norder of magnitude, therefore the mathematical frameworks developed separately so\nfar for high speed marine vehicles and airplanes are not suitable. This paper presents\nan integrated mathematical framework specifically for an AAMV configuration.\nAAMV System of Equations of Motion A mathematical model of the lon-\ngitudinal dynamics of a AAMV configuration, developed in the small disturbances\nframework, is presented. Coupling the systems of equations of motion, available in\nliterature, used for Wing in Ground effect (WIG) vehicles and for high speed plan-\ning craft, authors derived a new system of equations of motion. This mathematical\nmodel takes into account aerodynamic, hydrodynamic and hydrostatic stability\nderivatives, leading to a new dynamics. In fact, also if this AAMV mathematical\nmodel is obtained by combining the WIG vehicles and the planing craft dynamics,\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n18 M.

Comparison between the dynamics characteristics of conventional configurations\nand the AAMV dynamics\nthe resultant dynamics is not simply the sum of these dynamics. As shown in table\n3, the system of equations of motion developed by authors proposes a new dynamic\nfeature, with a potential new mode of oscillation and a more complex dynamics\nwith respect to WIG vehicles, planing craft and conventional airplanes.\nAAMV static stability criterion The AAMV dynamics differ substantially\nfrom planing craft dynamics and from airplanes and WIG vehicles dynamics, and\nthe static stability of a AAMV configuration is analysed, and a new static stability\ncriterion is proposed.\nBriefly, in the longitudinal plane, airplanes possess one neutral point, called aero-\ndynamic neutral point in pitch (or also neutral point): if this point is rearward with\nrespect to the CG of the vehicle, the airplane is statically stable. By contrast, WIG\nvehicles have an additional neutral point, the aerodynamic neutral point in height,\ndue to the fact that aerodynamic forces depend also on the vehicle\u2019s height above\nthe surface. To have a WIG vehicle statically stable in height, this second neutral\npoint should be upstream with respect to the first neutral point, as investigated\nby Staufenbiel & Bao-Tzang (1977), Irodov (1970), and Rozhdestvensky (1996).\nFor a aerodynamically alleviated marine vehicles (AAMV), a third neutral point\nexists, due to the fact that the forces depend on: the pitch angle, as for an airplane\nand WIG vehicles, the height above the surface, as in WIG vehicles, and the heave\nposition. In fact the hydrodynamic forces depend heavily on the heave position of\nthe AAMV. The condition expressed by eq. 5.17 can be expressed saying that the\nthird neutral point, also called the hydrodynamic centre in heave, should be located\ndownstream with respect to the neutral point 2, to have an AAMV that is statically\nstable in heave. The relative position of each point is shown in figure 4. In airplane\ndynamics, the distance between the CG and the (aerodynamic) neutral point (in\npitch) is called \u2018static stability margin\u2019 (ssm1). Following the same approach, the\ndistance between the second neutral point and the first neutral point can be called\n\u2018static stability margin in height\u2019 (ssm2). As already said, for a AAMV configura-\ntion a third neutral point exists, and the distance between the second and the third\nneutral point can be called \u2018hydrodynamic static stability margin in heave\u2019 (ssm3).\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\nLongitudinal Static Stability of an AAMV 19\nReferences\nBlake, J.
