In the glycine-buffered system, interactions between iron and glycine may 21 \ninfluence the concentration of arsenic in solution, which may not be consistent with human 22 \n  2 \ngastrointestinal conditions. The choice of a physiologically-based method may be more 1 \nappropriate to achieve representative arsenic bioaccessibility values toward estimating 2 \nrisks to human health.  3 \n 4 \nKeywords: bioaccessibility; arsenic; glycine; contaminated soil; tailings 5 \n 6 \nINTRODUCTION 7 \n 8 \nTraditional human health risk estimates are based on the total concentration of 9 \ncontaminants in soils,[1, 2] but several regulatory bodies worldwide now recognize that this 10 \nmay overestimate the actual risk.[3-5] Instead, using the bioavailable fraction, or the fraction 11 \nof a substance that can be absorbed and reach systemic circulation,[6] may provide a more 12 \nrepresentative estimation. This is especially important when the bioavailable fraction is 13 \npotentially much smaller than the total concentration of a contaminant. Such is the case for 14 \narsenic in soils, which is considered only one-fifth as bioavailable as soluble (aqueous) 15 \ninorganic arsenic.[7]  16 \n 17 \nArsenic bioavailability data may be obtained by measuring arsenic concentrations in the 18 \nblood and tissues of animals following their ingestion of arsenic-contaminated substrates. 19 \nSeveral in vivo ingestion studies have indicated that arsenic soil bioavailability depends on 20 \nsoil type and contaminant source, and varies from 2 to 48%.[8-12] Because bioavailability 21 \nvaries greatly, site and soil-specific measurements are required.  22 \n  3 \n 1 \nAlthough the use of in vivo models may provide representative bioavailability data for 2 \nestimating risks, the costs and ethics of using these models has led to the development of 3 \nlaboratory-based in vitro extraction tests that simulate human in vivo conditions. Results 4 \nfrom these tests provide an estimation of bioaccessibility, which is defined as the fraction 5 \nof a substance that is soluble in the gastrointestinal environment and is available for 6 \nabsorption.[13] Several methods have been developed to assess the bioaccessibility of soil 7 \ncontaminants but the results vary between methods, and concerns remain regarding the 8 \nreliability of such measurements.  9 \n 10 \nRuby et al.[11, 14] published one of the first studies examining a physiologically-based 11 \nextraction test (PBET). This test was based on rabbit gastrointestinal conditions and is 12 \nsimilar to paediatric conditions. It takes into consideration gastric and intestinal chemistry, 13 \nextraction pH, soil mass and fluid volume, stomach mixing and emptying rate, and small 14 \nintestinal transit time. This test is considered to be a valid predictor of oral lead 15 \nbioaccessibility.[15, 16] Rodriguez et al.[17] indicated that the arsenic bioaccessibility data 16 \nobtained by such an in vitro gastric method is strongly correlated with in vivo 17 \nbioavailability results, although the test slightly underestimated bioavailability. Several 18 \nadditional studies have used variations of this physiologically-based method to measure the 19 \nbioaccessibility of metals, or to simplify the method.[17-19]  20 \n 21 \n  4 \nParallel method development has been carried out by various agencies including the 1 \nSolubility\/Bioavailability Research Consortium (SBRC), which has established a simple in 2 \nvitro test using glycine as a buffer.[20] The SBRC calls for 0.4 M glycine, which is a much 3 \nhigher concentration than the < 1 mM concentrations of glycine typically found in 4 \nbiological fluids.[21] Although not physiologically representative, the gastric phase of the 5 \nSBRC method \u2013 also entitled the Relative Bioaccessibility Leaching Procedure \u2013 has been 6 \nvalidated against in vivo lead bioavailability data.[22] The USEPA recommends this method 7 \nto determine the relative bioavailability of lead for the purposes of risk assessment in 8 \nRegion 8 (Colorado Area).[23] The in vivo database for arsenic is not as extensive as that 9 \nfor lead,[20] and a glycine-buffered test has yet to be validated for estimating arsenic 10 \nbioavailability.[24]  11 \n 12 \nIn addition to the inherent variability introduced by any chosen method and their related 13 \nparameters (e.g. extraction pH, liquid-to-solid ratios), the bioaccessibility of arsenic may 14 \nbe affected by arsenic speciation[25] and soil physicochemical properties. Specifically, 15 \nhigher soil iron oxide content and lower soil pH both tend to yield lower 16 \nbioaccessibility.[26-28] In some cases, the bioaccessibility is negatively correlated with 17 \narsenic concentration in soil,[25, 29] but other studies have found the bioaccessibility of 18 \narsenic to be independent of soil arsenic concentration.[19] The negative dependence of 19 \nbioaccessibility on soil arsenic concentration may be an indication of solubility saturation, 20 \nand Richardson et al.[30] recommend carrying out tests at various liquid-to-solid ratios to 21 \nrule out this possibility. In some cases (where glycine was used as a buffer), the arsenic 22 \n  5 \nbioaccessibility increased with an increased ratio,[31] whereas other studies (that did not use 1 \nglycine) have shown arsenic bioaccessibility to be independent of liquid-to-solid ratio.[25] 2 \nThus the choice of buffer in estimating arsenic bioaccessibility may influence the results. 3 \n 4 \nIn this study, arsenic-contaminated tailings, soils and reference materials representing a 5 \nrange of iron to arsenic molar ratios were subjected to bioaccessibility tests using both a 6 \nphysiologically-based test (Method P) and a glycine-buffered test (Method G) under 7 \nsimulated gastric and gastric followed by intestinal conditions. The results were examined 8 \nto determine the effects of extraction pH, liquid-to-solid ratio, buffer choice and 9 \nconcentration, and arsenic and iron concentrations on the bioaccessibility of arsenic. The 10 \nobjective was to evaluate the variability introduced by the methods and sample 11 \ncharacteristics in measuring the bioaccessibility of arsenic.  12 \n 13 \nMATERIALS AND METHODS 14 \n 15 \nSample Description and Preparation 16 \n 17 \nThe test materials consisted of soils and tailings samples, reference materials, and solid 18 \nmatrices. The soils and tailings samples were taken from arsenic-contaminated abandoned 19 \ngold mine sites in Nova Scotia, Canada,[32] and are described by Meunier et al.[25] The 20 \nstandard reference materials selected were NIST2710[33] and NIST2711[34], and a reference 21 \nsoil from the British Geological Survey (BGS 102) was also tested.[35] Two more samples 22 \n  6 \nconsisted primarily of arsenic minerals: a mine tailings sample rich in scorodite 1 \n(FeAsO4\u20222H2O) collected at Lower Seal Harbour (LSH), Nova Scotia, Canada,[32] and a 2 \nsample of arsenopyrite (FeAsS) from Ni\u00f1as de Panasqueira, Portugal (Ward\u2019s Natural 3 \nScience). Ironite\u00ae (Mineral Supplement 1-0-0), a commercial fertilizer that contains high 4 \nconcentrations of arsenic and iron from mine waste was also tested. All tailings samples 5 \nwere dried and sieved to a <150 \u03bcm particle size. The arsenopyrite and LSH tailings 6 \nsamples were ground and homogenized, using a mortar and pestle, to a <150 \u03bcm particle 7 \nsize. Ironite\u00ae was sieved to <150 \u03bcm. Reference materials and soil were used as received 8 \n(the particle size for NIST2710 and NIST2711 is <74 \u03bcm, and the BGS102 particle size is 9 \n<50\u03bcm).  10 \n 11 \nSample Elemental Composition 12 \n 13 \nThe certified arsenic and iron concentrations of the standard reference materials NIST2710 14 \nand 2711 were used.[33, 34] All other samples were analyzed for major and trace elements by 15 \naqua regia digestion. Analytical results for the Nova Scotia samples are described in detail 16 \nby Parsons et al.[32] Digestions of the remaining samples were performed according to 17 \nMethod 200.7[36] and analyzed by the Analytical Services Unit, Queen\u2019s university, 18 \nKingston, ON using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (Varian 19 \nAX-Vista Pro). The results for the total arsenic concentration in BGS102 (94 mg\u2022kg-1) is 20 \ncomparable to unpublished data for this sample (102 mg\u2022kg-1).[37]  21 \n 22 \n  7 \nBioaccessibility Extractions 1 \n 2 \nFor each sample, the bioaccessibility of arsenic and iron was measured using two different 3 \nmethods and two liquid-to-solid ratios (i.e. 100:1 and 2000:1). The glycine-buffered 4 \nMethod G was based on a SBRC method modified from Kelley et al.[20] The 5 \nphysiologically-based Method P was modified from Ruby et al.[11] and Rodriguez et al.,[17] 6 \nand is similar to tests carried out by Cave et al.[38] and Koch et al.[39] These in vitro 7 \nexperiments consisted of a gastric phase (phase 1, denoted P1), and a gastric followed by 8 \nan intestinal phase (phase 2, denoted P2).  9 \n 10 \nExperiments were carried out in batches of 8 to 12 samples, along with two duplicate pairs, 11 \none blank and one reference material (NIST2710 or NIST2711) for each phase. All 12 \nchemicals and reagents used in the bioaccessibility tests were analytical grade or better, 13 \nand all solutions were prepared with distilled deionised water (DDW, Barnstead E-pure 14 \nreverse osmosis\/ion exchange apparatus Water Purification System, minimum resistance 15 \n18 M\u2126\u2022cm).  16 \n 17 \nGastric solution compositions are described in detail by Koch et al.[39]. Briefly, the gastric 18 \nsolution of Method G contained 0.4 M glycine (Sigma) in DDW acidified with 19 \nhydrochloric acid (HCl Fisher) to a pH of 1.5 \u00b1 0.05 (Acumet Excel XL15). For Method G, 20 \nan additional series of tests was performed at the 2000:1 liquid-to-solid ratio using a more 21 \ndilute (0.02 M) glycine solution. In Method P, the gastric solution includes porcine pepsin 22 \n  8 \n(Sigma-Aldrich), sodium citrate (Caledon), malic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), glacial acetic acid 1 \n(Fisher), and sodium chloride (Fluka) in DDW (concentrations can be found in Koch et 2 \nal.[39] The solution was similarly acidified to a pH of 1.80 \u00b1 0.05.  3 \n 4 \nTest procedures are identical for both methods. In the 100:1 liquid-to-solid ratio tests, two 5 \nsubsamples were tested for each sample (representing P1 and P2). Measured amounts of 6 \ngastric solution (20 ml) were poured into 50-ml polyethylene specimen containers and 7 \nheated to 37 \u00b0C. A previously measured quantity of solid sample (0.2 g) was added to this 8 \nprepared solution and the test containers were secured in a temperature-controlled flatbed 9 \nrotation incubator (New Brunswick Scientific Innova 4230) at 37 \u00b0C and 150 rpm under 10 \naerobic conditions. The pH was measured after 30 minutes (and acidified as required), and 11 \nagain at the end of the one-hour gastric phase. Samples were stirred over a hot plate (37 12 \n\u00b0C) while pH measurement took place, and the time taken to measure pH (less than six 13 \nminutes per sample) was included in the overall incubation time. At the end of the gastric 14 \nstage of the test, samples used in the gastric phase only (P1) were removed from the 15 \nsample set.  16 \n 17 \nThe remaining samples were retained for the gastric followed by intestinal phase of the test 18 \n(denoted P2). At the beginning of P2, the solutions were modified to simulate intestinal 19 \nconditions by raising the pH to 7.0 \uf0b1 0.2 using a saturated NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich) solution 20 \nfor Method G,[20] and a 10 M solution of Na2CO3 (Fluka) for Method P. Porcine bile 21 \n(Sigma) and porcine pancreatin (Sigma-Aldrich) was also added to all intestinal solutions. 22 \n  9 \nTest containers were returned to the incubator. The pH was measured after two hours (and 1 \nadjusted as required), and again at the end of the four-hour intestinal stage of the test. The 2 \ntime taken to measure pH (less than 12 minutes during the intestinal stage of the test) was 3 \nincluded in the overall incubation time. 4 \n 5 \nIn the 2000:1 liquid-to-solid ratios tests, a single subsample was prepared for each solid 6 \nsample (to be used for both P1 and P2). Measured amounts of gastric solution (300 ml) 7 \nwere poured into 1-L polyethylene specimen containers and heated to 37 \u00baC. A previously 8 \nmeasured quantity of solid sample (0.15 g) was added to this prepared solution. Test 9 \ncontainers were heated and shaken, and the pH was measured and adjusted as described 10 \nabove. At the end of the gastric portion of the test, a solution aliquot (representing the P1 11 \nextract) was removed by syringe and filter (0.45 \u00b5m, PVDF membrane, Milipore), and 12 \nreplaced with fresh gastric solution. The intestinal stage of the test was conducted as 13 \ndescribed above.  14 \n 15 \nAt the end of each experiment, extracts were transferred to centrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 16 \n3800 rpm (2970\u2022g) for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was filtered (0.45 \u00b5m, PVDF 17 \nmembrane, Milipore).  18 \n 19 \nAll collected extracts from Method G and Method P were stored frozen (to -18 \u00b0C) and 20 \nreserved for analysis. Thawed aliquots of each extract were diluted with 2% nitric acid 21 \n(HNO3 Fisher) solution and analyzed for total arsenic and iron concentrations by 22 \n  10 \ninductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry (Thermo Electron Corporation X-SeriesII) 1 \nin collision cell mode as described by Smith et al.[40] Bioaccessibility results are expressed 2 \nas a concentration or as a percentage. The quantity of a substance (mg\u2022kg-1 dry weight) 3 \nextracted during a bioaccessibility test is defined as the bioaccessible concentration. 4 \nDividing this quantity by the total concentration in a given sample and multiplying by 100 5 \ngives the percent bioaccessibility.  6 \n 7 \nQuality Assurance and Quality Control 8 \n 9 \nQuality control tests and results are summarized in Table 1. Tests include blanks, 10 \nduplicates and a standard reference material (SRM), NIST2710, used in bioaccessibility 11 \nextractions, as well as matrix spikes and a calibration check solution for ICP-MS analysis. 12 \nThe ICP-MS instrument detection limit was based on three standard deviations of eight 13 \nreplicate measurements of a low concentration solution (1 and 10 \u00b5g\u2022L-1 for arsenic and 14 \niron respectively); 88 of the 101 blanks returned numbers below the arsenic and iron 15 \ninstrument detection limit (1 \u00b5g\u2022L-1 for arsenic; 10 \u00b5g\u2022L-1 for iron). All blanks were below 16 \nthe limit of quantification (3 \u00b5g\u2022L-1 for arsenic; 20 \u00b5g\u2022L-1 for iron). All SRM arsenic and 17 \niron results were within laboratory control limits (Table 1). Given the low variability in 18 \nSRM iron bioaccessibility between all methods and all liquid-to-solid ratios, these results 19 \nwere combined and are shown as a single entry in Table 1. The average of the relative 20 \npercent difference (RPD) between extraction duplicates was less than 17%. However, RPD 21 \nvalues as high as 76% were recorded for duplicates associated with one sample (MG6), 22 \n  11 \nand may be attributed to heterogeneity of this particular sample for reasons unknown at 1 \nthis time. 2 \n 3 \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION 4 \n 5 \nThe 19 samples used in this study cover a wide range of arsenic concentrations (from 94 to 6 \n420 000 mg\u2022kg-1) and iron to arsenic molar ratios (from 1.2 to 2600). Of these, the 13 7 \nNova Scotia tailings samples (identified by the prefixes CAR-, GD-, MG-, and NB-) were 8 \nincluded in a previous study investigating the effects of soil composition and mineralogy 9 \non arsenic bioaccessibility from a suite of 29 tailings and soil samples.[25] These 13 10 \nsamples represent the wide range of arsenic concentrations and physical characteristics 11 \nencountered throughout the Nova Scotia gold mining districts. They were selected for 12 \nfurther experiments in the present study to compare the results previously obtained using 13 \nMethod P (at the 100:1 and 2000:1 liquid-to-solid ratios) with the arsenic bioaccessibility 14 \nvalues obtained by Method G. The results of both methods are presented in Table 2 15 \n(arsenic bioaccessibility), and Table 3 (iron bioaccessibility). The percent arsenic 16 \nbioaccessibility ranges from near zero to 79%. The range of iron bioaccessibility results is 17 \nmuch smaller, varying from near zero to a maximum of 19%.  18 \n 19 \nAs previously indicated, physicochemical soil properties and arsenic speciation may result 20 \nin large variations within methods. Furthermore, variations between methods may be 21 \nattributed to a number of parameters including extraction pH, liquid-to-solid ratio, method, 22 \n  12 \nand buffer concentration. First, the results are examined with respect to the extraction pH 1 \nto determine if the choice of buffer affects pH stability, how the bioaccessibility pH 2 \nconditions affect the bioaccessibility. The discussion then addresses the effects of liquid-3 \nto-solid ratio, buffer concentration, and iron on the bioaccessibility.  4 \n 5 \nEffect of Buffer on the Stability of Method pH 6 \n 7 \nThe ease with which pH is measured and maintained throughout a bioaccessibility test can 8 \nbe an important factor in designing a test that is simple and economical, while providing a 9 \nrepresentative measure of the soluble fraction of a contaminant.[41] Buffers that are 10 \neffective at gastric (pH < 2) and intestinal (pH ~ 7) pH are desirable. Glycine (used in 11 \nMethod G, pKas 2.3 and 9.6), as well as the combination of citrate, malate and acetate 12 \n(used in Method P, pKas 3-3.4, 5-6.4) meet this requirement, since the solutions are 13 \ndiprotic with pKas near the appropriate pHs.  14 \n 15 \nDuring the gastric stage of the test, pH measurements (before adjustment) varied by \u00b10.07 16 \nfor Method G (using the 0.4 M glycine concentration), which was a smaller variation than 17 \nthat observed for Method P (\u00b10.15). Under intestinal conditions, greater variations in pH 18 \nmeasurements were recorded, and Method G (0.4 M glycine) once again demonstrated 19 \nmore stability (\u00b10.17) than Method P (\u00b10.87). However, when the dilute 0.02M glycine 20 \nconcentration was used, wider variations were recorded under gastric and intestinal 21 \nconditions (\u00b10.16 and \u00b11.1 respectively). Therefore, at its higher 0.4 M concentration, the 22 \n  13 \nglycine buffer provides a more effective buffering capacity than both Method G at the 1 \ndilute 0.02 M glycine and Method P. This suggests that the higher buffer concentration 2 \nprovides useful pH control, but the rest of the study examines other associated effects. The 3 \nnext section outlines how the pH in each buffer mixture affects the bioaccessibility results. 4 \n 5 \nEffect of Gastric and Intestinal Extraction Conditions on the Bioaccessibility of Arsenic 6 \n 7 \nBioaccessibility tests are intended to represent a worst-case scenario for the solubility of a 8 \ncontaminant in a simulated gastro-intestinal tract.[41] These tests thereby provide more 9 \nconservative (protective) adjustments in human health risk assessments. Since the 10 \nbioaccessibility of arsenic may be influenced by the extraction pH,[11] bioaccessibility tests 11 \nwere carried out under both gastric (acidic pH) and intestinal (neutral pH) conditions. In 12 \nmore than 70 percent of the results (all methods tested), the bioaccessibility of arsenic is 13 \ngreater in P2 compared to P1 (Table 2). Inspection of the results in Table 2 reveals that 14 \nseveral tailings samples (NB11A, NB6B, GD2, LSH Tailings, CAR 1, and GD1) returned 15 \na higher arsenic bioaccessibility result in P2 for all 5 treatments. The Ironite\u00ae and 16 \nNIST2710 sample exhibited the reverse trend of having a higher P1 arsenic 17 \nbioaccessibility in all cases. For the lower 100:1 liquid-to-solid ratios, variations between 18 \nP1 and P2 were relatively small (paired t-tests, loge transformed data, p > 0.52), but these 19 \nvariations were statistically significant when the higher 2000:1 liquid-to-solid ratio was 20 \nused (paired t-tests, loge transformed data, p < 0.011) for both Methods G and P (Table 2). 21 \nVariations between P1 and P2 were not as apparent in the iron bioaccessibility results 22 \n  14 \n(Table 3). In four of the five treatments, statistical analysis reveals that the extraction pH 1 \ndid not significantly affect the bioaccessibility of iron (paired t-tests, loge transformed data, 2 \np > 0.064). The only exception is for Method G at the 100:1 liquid-to-solid ratio, where the 3 \nP1 results were greater than the P2 iron bioaccessibility for all but one sample (paired t-4 \ntests, loge transformed data, p = 0.009).  5 \n 6 \nFor this type of experiment, we have determined that the acceptable within-laboratory 7 \nrepeatability is \u00b130%, which is consistent with the uncertainty estimated for total arsenic 8 \nconcentration results from accredited laboratories[42] for such environmental samples. 9 \nTherefore, two results that are within 30% of each other are no more distinguishable than 10 \ntwo replicate analyses. The 30% uncertainty was used as a benchmark for comparison of 11 \nP1 and P2 values in Tables 2 and 3, where the higher result of either P1 or P2 is indicated 12 \nin bold only where the relative percent difference (RPD) between the two results is greater 13 \nthan the 30%. The RPD varied by more than 30% in 53 of the 95 arsenic bioaccessibility 14 \nmeasurements, and in 62 of the 90 iron bioaccessibility measurements.  15 \n 16 \nThe predominance of higher P2 results for arsenic, illustrates that carrying out 17 \nbioaccessibility measurements in one phase only, as is typically done when the gastric 18 \nphase (P1) is assumed to represent worst-case conditions, would not necessarily provide 19 \nthe most conservative estimates, especially in the case of arsenic-contaminated mine 20 \ntailings. In the next sections, the higher value of P1 or P2 (typically chosen as a worst-case 21 \n  15 \nscenario in risk assessments) for each sample was used in the comparisons between 1 \nmethods.  2 \n 3 \nEffect of Liquid-to-Solid Ratios 4 \n 5 \nPrevious arsenic bioaccessibility results reveal that, for the 13 Nova Scotia mine tailings 6 \nsamples included in the present study, Method P was insensitive to liquid-to-solid ratios 7 \nranging from 100:1 to 5000:1.[25] To test the effects of this variable, bioaccessibility 8 \nextractions were carried out on an additional six samples (Table 2). There were no 9 \nsignificant differences between the two liquid-to-solid ratios tested by Method P (paired t-10 \ntests, loge transformed data, p = 0.74 for the entire set of 19 samples, and p = 0.37 when 11 \ncomparing only the six additional samples). This finding is consistent with other results 12 \nfrom physiologically-based bioaccessibility tests.[43, 44] The results are illustrated Figure 1, 13 \nwhere similarities between the two liquid-to-solid ratios are apparent for Method P, with 14 \nexceptions noted only for samples BGS102 and NIST2710 (higher arsenic bioaccessibility 15 \nat the higher liquid-to-solid ratio) and GD5 (higher arsenic bioaccessibility at the lower 16 \nliquid-to-solid ratio). In such a case, the bioaccessibility results obtained at the 100:1 17 \nliquid-to-solid ratio with Method P would be used for risk assessment purposes.[30] 18 \nConversely, large variations were observed in the case of Method G (Figure 1). Compared 19 \nwith the 100:1 liquid-to-solid ratio, the arsenic bioaccessibility results were significantly 20 \nhigher when the higher 2000:1H (0.4 M glycine) ratio was used (paired t-tests, loge 21 \ntransformed data, p < 0.0010). In such a case, the values obtained using the higher liquid-22 \n  16 \nto-solid ratio should be retained.[30] However at this 2000:1 H liquid-to-solid ratio, a 1 \ngreater amount of buffer is available, and we hypothesize that the buffer concentration may 2 \naffect arsenic bioaccessibility.  3 \n 4 \nEffect of Buffer Concentration 5 \n 6 \nFurther experiments were conducted to determine whether the bioaccessibility of arsenic 7 \nwas influenced by the liquid-to-solid ratio, or by the amount of glycine present. An 8 \nadditional series of tests was therefore performed using 0.02 M glycine at the 2000:1 9 \nliquid-to-solid ratio. At this dilute glycine concentration, the ratio of glycine to solid 10 \nsample is the same as in the 100:1 (0.4 M glycine) liquid-to-solid ratio test. In other words, 11 \nfor this experiment, the amount of glycine used in the 100:1 ratio was diluted to a 2000:1 12 \nratio. This test is denoted 2000:1L to differentiate it from the higher 0.4 M glycine 13 \nconcentration test identified as 2000:1H.  14 \n 15 \nThe results for Method G at 2000:1H (0.4 M glycine) generally give higher 16 \nbioaccessibility results than the other two method G treatments, for which the results are 17 \nsimilar, as shown in Figure 1. This trend is observed for a large majority of samples (15 of 18 \nthe 19 samples), and suggests that a higher amount of glycine increases arsenic 19 \nbioaccessibility, even though statistical analysis did not reveal significant differences (1-20 \nway ANOVA with Bonferroni adjustment for the three Method G treatments, p = 0.17; and 21 \n1-way ANOVA of all five treatments with Bonferroni adjustment, p = 0.45). A larger data 22 \n  17 \nset may reveal statistically significant differences, which are only apparent in pair-wise 1 \ncomparisons of the results for individual samples. In paired t-tests, results for Method G at 2 \n0.4 M glycine and the 2000:1H ratio are significantly different from the results obtained in 3 \nthe other four treatments (paired t-tests, loge transformed data, p < 0.0010). The higher 4 \nbioaccessibility may result from glycine stabilizing cationic species in solution, including 5 \niron (as described by Castillo and Ramirez),[45] and arsenic associated with this iron may 6 \nbe released (i.e. when iron remains in solution, so does arsenic). Therefore, in the Method 7 \nG experiments, it is likely the amount of glycine present and the influence of a glycine-iron 8 \ncomplex that affects the arsenic bioaccessibility, rather than variations in the liquid-to-solid 9 \nratios. In the following section, the relationship between iron and arsenic is further 10 \nexamined by comparing bioaccessibility results and iron to arsenic concentrations. 11 \n 12 \nEffect of Iron Concentration on the Bioaccessibility of Arsenic 13 \n 14 \nThe arsenic bioaccessibility results presented in Figure 1 are shown in decreasing order of 15 \niron to arsenic molar ratio for each sample, and the results appear generally lower as this 16 \nratio decreases, although this trend is not statistically significant (linear regression, r < 17 \n0.23, p > 0.19). However, for all five treatments, the percent arsenic bioaccessibility is 18 \nnegatively correlated with the total arsenic concentration (linear regression, r > 0.50, p < 19 \n0.033) and with the total iron concentration (linear regression, r > 0.49, p < 0.035). This is 20 \nconsistent with previous findings for similar tailings samples.[25, 29] As demonstrated in the 21 \nprevious sections, this negative relationship is not associated with solution saturation. 22 \n  18 \nPrevious findings have established that the highest arsenic concentrations in the tailings 1 \nsamples are associated with sparingly soluble arsenic minerals,[25] and the decreased 2 \nbioaccessibility is likely associated with an increased proportion of these minerals.  3 \n 4 \nWhen the percent arsenic and iron bioaccessibilities are compared, the only method that 5 \ndiffers slightly from the others is Method G at the higher 0.4 M glycine and 2000:1H ratio, 6 \nfor which the results show a weak positive correlation (linear regression, r = 0.22) (Figure 7 \n2). While this slope (0.13) is not significantly different from zero (p = 0.36), it is higher 8 \nthan that for the other four treatments (slopes < 0.073, r < 0.32, p > 0.51). Thus, when a 9 \nhigher liquid-to-solid ratio is used with a 0.4 M glycine concentration, higher bioaccessible 10 \narsenic concentrations appear to be associated to the greatest extent with higher 11 \nbioaccessible iron concentrations. This result supports the hypothesis that extraction in the 12 \npresence of greater amounts of glycine is conducive to solubilising more iron (and 13 \nassociated arsenic) than amounts that would be extracted under more physiologically 14 \nrepresentative conditions.  15 \n 16 \nCONCLUSION 17 \n 18 \nFor the series of soils and tailings studied, the bioaccessibility of arsenic estimated by 19 \nMethod P is not significantly affected by varying solid-to-liquid ratios and changes in pH, 20 \nwhereas differences in bioaccessibility results were observed for the glycine-buffered 21 \nMethod G. The bioaccessible arsenic concentration was also higher when a greater amount 22 \n  19 \nof glycine was available in solution, which may be influenced by the interaction between 1 \nglycine and iron. The consequence is that using a glycine buffer in arsenic bioaccessibility 2 \nextractions may unduly influence the results by introducing methodological artefacts that 3 \ndo not mimic the human gastro-intestinal conditions. At this time, neither Method P nor 4 \nMethod G has been accepted by any regulatory agency as a validated method for arsenic 5 \n(against in vivo bioavailability data),[46] although some comparisons between Method G 6 \nand modified Method P arsenic bioaccessibility results with bioavailability results are 7 \navailable[47, 48 and other references therein, 49]. In vivo hamster arsenic data[50] are also available for 8 \none of the samples in the present study (Ironite\u00ae). For this sample, results from all 9 \nmethods tested (28-32% for Method P; 25-39% for Method G) compared equally well with 10 \narsenic bioavailability values (31 \u00b1 6%) and did not vary significantly between methods. 11 \nFor this reason, it is not possible to unambiguously distinguish between methods based on 12 \nin vivo data; clearly more bioavailability data are required to compare and validate 13 \nbioaccessibility methods.  14 \n 15 \nThe present study demonstrates that the practicality of a method and the potential for 16 \nartefacts resulting from that same method must be balanced. Method G has been accepted 17 \nas a useful method to estimate lead bioaccessibility, and hence bioavailability, but its 18 \napplication to other elements and soil samples may require careful consideration and study.  19 \nThe choice of a bioaccessibility method that is both physiologically based and robust with 20 \nrespect to changes in method variables, such as Method P, may provide more 21 \n  20 \nrepresentative arsenic bioaccessibility results for the purpose of estimating risks to human 1 \nhealth.  2 \n 3 \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 4 \n 5 \nThe authors wish to thank A.
