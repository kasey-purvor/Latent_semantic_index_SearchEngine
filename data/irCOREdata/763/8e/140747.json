In contrast to monoclonal antibodies, the regeneration of MIP chip\n2did not affect its recognition properties and continuous measurement was possible over a period of\nat least two months.\nKeywords: Domoic Acid, MIP, thin films, SPR, AFM.\nIntroduction\nDomoic acid (DA) is a water-soluble, natural excitatory and neurotoxic amino acid, previously\nisolated from two red algae: Chondria armata and Alsidium coralliu. This toxin can also originate\nfrom marine diatoms (such as Nitzchia pungens) and accumulate in mussels (such as Mytilus\nedulis), crabs or anchovies. On ingestion by humans, DA contaminated shellfish may cause an\nintoxication syndrome known as amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). The ASP syndrome is\ncharacterised by gastro-intestinal symptoms such as vomiting, cramps, and diarrhoea and by\nneurological symptoms including severe headache, seizures and either temporary or permanent\nmemory loss (Falconer, 1993).\nSeveral analytical methods have been developed for the quantitative determination of domoic acid\nin shellfish and marine phytoplankton. The original method used for the detection of this toxin was\nthe mouse bioassay, involving intra-peritoneal injection of mice with an acidic extract of whole\nmussels. A positive effect produces a characteristic syndrome in mice, that is distinct from other\nmarine toxins (Iverson, et al., 1989). A sensitive liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry (LC-\nMS) method has also been developed for the determination of DA in various marine biological\nsamples (Furey, et al., 2001). Applications of the assay to analyse domoic acid in seawater and\nshellfish has been also reported both based on antibodies (Kania and Hock, 2002, Smith and Kitts,\n1994) and cloned glutamate receptor.\nNevertheless, problems of high cost of measurement and poor stability of biological materials used\nin assays remains a major obstacle. The ideal systems for the measurement of such toxins should be\n3sensitive, robust and relatively inexpensive. Molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) technology is an\nalternative to natural material, where the cost of imprinting is dictated only by the cost of the\ntemplate. Since many toxins, including domoic acid, are very expensive, it was necessary to find a\nway to minimise the amounts of the polymer used in sensor fabrication. Another issue in the\nfabrication of sensitive evanescent wave-based optical biosensors is related specifically to the extent\nof the evanescent field, which is only capable of detecting events taking place 100s of nm above the\nsurface.\nIn this work we combine recognition elements based on stable and inexpensive ultra-thin MIP films\nwith a sensitive transducer based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to develop an optical MIP-\nbased biosensor selective towards domoic acid. By immobilising a photo-labile radical initiator to\nthe gold surface prior to the introduction of the pre-polymerisation mixture, the polymerisation\nreaction could be confined to the vicinity of the gold surface, resulting in a covalently attached MIP\nnano-film.\nA similar approach was used in a recent work where the technique of grafting polymerization has\nbeen used for preparation of thin films of molecularly imprinting polymers on the surface of\npolypropylene membranes and on hydrophobised gold electrodes for the herbicide desmetryn\n(Panasyuk-Delaney, et al., 2001). Using another approach Schweitz reported on a novel preparation\nprotocol for MIP film coatings in capillary columns (Schweitz, 2002). The MIP coatings were\nsynthesised \u2018in situ\u2019 under conditions that allow a wide variability of the MIP composition. By\nimmobilising a photo-labile radical initiator to the capillary surface prior to the introduction of the\npre-polymerisation mixture, the polymerisation reaction was confined to the vicinity of the capillary\nsurface, resulting in a covalently attached MIP coating. The use of different porogens during the\npolymerisation reaction facilitates control of the MIP coating in term of morphology and\nappearance. The MIP coatings synthesised using solvents such as toluene, dichloromethane, and\n4acetonitrile, all provided enantiomer separation of the amino alcohol propranolol. In addition,\nPiletsky et al. (Piletsky, et al., 2000) developed a general method for grafting MIPs to the surface of\na stable synthetic polymer. Microfiltration membranes made of polypropylene were used as matrix.\nSurface photografted copolymerisation using benzophenone as photoinitiator in the presence of\ntemplate desmetryn introduces specific binding sites into porous membrane without damaging its\npore structure and thus preserving its transport properties.\nThe above approaches require small amounts of polymer and this makes sensor fabrication feasible\neven for expensive target molecules such as toxins.\nExperimental section\nMaterials\nAll reagents and solvents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). Domoic acid was\npurchased from Affinity Research Product Ltd. (Exeter, UK) and the anti-domoic acid antibody was\nprovided by the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Glass slides are from BDH (Poole,\nDorset, UK). All solvents were HPLC grade.\nVacuum deposition of gold on glass surface\nIn order to optimise the photo-grafting procedure the different steps involved were studied by\nworking on a gold-coated glass slide before transferring the MIP film procedure onto the BIAcore\nchip. To obtain flat gold surfaces, a 1 cm2 glass slide was firstly cleaned of organic contaminants\nusing the following procedure: (i) ultrasonication in deionised (DI) water for 10 minutes, (ii)\nimmersion in HCl 5M for 10 minutes followed by (iii) rinsing in DI water with swirling and\nsubsequent ultrasonication in fresh DI water for 15 min, (iv) ultrasonication in isopropanol for 15\nmin and finally drying in the stream of argon. The slide were then placed in an Edwards coating\n5system E306A (Crawley, UK) and coated under high vacuum (1.5\uf0b410-6mbar) by evaporation of (i) a\n1 nm thick adhesive chromium layer and (ii) a 50 nm thick gold layer, which mimics the conditions\nnecessary for the creation of surface plasmon. The sensor chip (Pioneer J1, BIAcore AB, Uppsala,\nSweden) consisted of a glass slide mounted in a plastic frame. On one side of the glass, a thin film,\napproximately 50 nm, of gold had been deposited. Before use, the BIAcore gold chips used for the\ngrafting experiments were cleaned by ultrasonication in ethanol for 30 minutes.\nPolymerisation procedure.\nThe gold chips were then coated with a self-assembled monolayer of 2-mercaptoethylamine by\nsoaking in 1 mM 2-mercaptoethylamine in ethanol for 24 hours at room temperature. Following a\nbrief washing with water and ethanol, the gold surface was again ultrasonicated for 2 minutes in\nethanol and dried in argon. The gold chip was coated for 18 hours (in the dark at room temperature)\nwith 1 ml of a solution comprising: 20 mM 4,4\u2019-azo-bis (cyanovaleric acid) photo-initiator, 20 mM\nwater-soluble carbodiimmide and 20 mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in ethanol. After another washing\nstep with ethanol, ultrasonication for 2 minutes and drying with argon, 50 \uf06dl of polymerisation\nsolution in water (0.25 mmol of 2-(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate, 0.5 mmol of N,N\u2019-\nmethylenebisacrylamide and 16 nmol of template DA) was purged with argon for five minutes and\ndeposited on top of the gold chip. The mixture on the chip was irradiated with ultraviolet light (UV-\nlamp model N\u00b0 LX300F, Cermax collimated xenon arc lamp, ILC Technology, Inc., USA) for 30\nminutes. After polymerisation, the grafted gold chip was incubated in methanol for two hours in\norder to remove some homopolymer, residual chemicals and template. Two control chips were\ngrafted following the same procedure described above but without the template domoic acid. A\nschematic representation of the grafting procedure is presented in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Scheme of the grafting procedure.\n6Characterisation of Photo-Grafted MIP by static contact angle measurements\nPhoto-grafting of the MIP thin films onto the treated gold surfaces (for SPR studies) was first\ninvestigated using contact angle measurements. Contact angle measurements were made using a\nCCD camera purchased from Spectra Source Equipment (model MCD400S, Westlake Village,\nCalifornia, USA) together with the software provided. Calculations and image processing were\nmade using Paint Shop Pro 5 (Jasc Software). To follow the different changes in surface\ncharacteristics due to the various chemical treatments, static contact angle measurements were\nperformed. A 10 \u03bcL drop of DI water was carefully deposited onto the substrate and images were\nacquired using the CCD camera.\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) Imaging\nAtomic Force Microscopy images were obtained using the PicoScanTM instrument (Molecular\nImaging Corporation, Tempe, AZ, USA). AFM images were taken by scanning the sample relative\nto a sharp probing tip (which is attached to a cantilever spring) and measuring the deflection of the\ncantilever as a function of lateral position. The area studied was continuously scanned for one hour\n(approximately 50 scans). After the additional force was removed, the tip of the cantilever was\nslightly lifted and moved to scan a larger area (6 \uf06dm by 6 \uf06dm). The tip was re-engaged with the\nsurface and the feed back loop re-set. From the topographical image it was possible to evaluate the\nMIP layer thickness using the software controlling the microscope, which allowed such calculation.\nMIP Characterisation by BIAcore Analysis\nThe BIAcore 3000TM (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used for grafted polymer testing and\ncomparison with monoclonal anti-domoic acid antibody, provided by Prof. Hock from the\nTechnical University of Munich (Germany). The grafted MIP sensor was inserted into the\ninstrument with the gold side in contact with the flow cell. Running buffer (HBS buffer, 10mM\n7HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA and 0.005% (v\/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) was constantly\npassed through the chip at a flow rate of 15 \uf06dl.min-1 and the temperature was maintained at 25 \u00b0C.\nA steady baseline in the sensorgram curves was achieved (average time 30 minutes to1 hour).\nThe interaction analysis using BIAcore 3000TM was carried out by injecting 80 \uf06dl of the conjugate\nDA-HRP (conjugation ratio 1:1) or native HRP (both provided by Prof. Hock from Technical\nUniversity of Munich), at concentrations ranging from 6 to 400 mg.l-1 and at a flow rate of 30 \uf06dl.\nmin-1. The competitive reaction was performed by injecting 150 \uf06dl of a solution containing an equal\nvolume of HRP-DA conjugate (200 mg.l-1) and the target analytes at different concentration (0-100\n\uf06dg l-1) at flow rate of 30 \uf06dl.min-1. Each injection was followed by a washing phase with HBS-EP\nbuffer (two injections of 50 \uf06dl at flow rate of 50 \u00b5l.min-1) and one regeneration step comprising one\ninjection of 10 \uf06dl 0.2 % SDS in 10 mM HCl, pH 2.5 and at flow rate of 5 \uf06dl.min-1. Response units\nwere calculated as the difference in response between two sequential data points in the sensorgram.\nCross reactivity (CR) for the grafted polymer was also evaluated for the DA analogues kainic acid\n(KA), glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp). The values of % CR are summarised and\ncompared to anti-domoic acid monoclonal antibody performance (Table 2).\nBiacore Analysis of Anti-Domoic Acid Antibody\nThe carboxylated dextran matrix of a gold chip CM5 (research grade CM5, Biacore AB, Uppsala,\nSweden) was activated by mixing equal volumes of 0.2 M N-ethyl-N\u2019-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)\ncarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (amine coupling kit, Biacore\nAB, Uppsala, Sweden). The mixture was injected (35 \uf06dl) onto the sensor surface for 7 minutes at a\nflow rate of 5 \uf06dl.min-1. The anti-domoic acid antibodies, were firstly immobilised on the chip, in 10\nmM acetate buffer pH 5. The immobilisation injection flow rate was 5 \uf06dl.min-1 with a total volume\nof 35 \uf06dl for each sample at 25 \u00b0C. The procedure was completed by a 7-min injection of 1 M\n8ethanolamine hydrochloride (35 \uf06dl), in order to block any remaining ester groups. One channel was\nused as a control with bound non-specific antibody (Hock, et al., 2002). Since the immobilised\nantibody lost a significant amount of its functionality when the regeneration steps were performed,\na format with the conjugate immobilised was also investigated. Three different concentrations of the\nconjugate HRP-DA (150, 300, 500 mg.l-1) were immobilised by injecting a total volume of 35 \uf06dl of\neach sample at flow rate was of 5 \uf06dl.min-1 and temperature of 25 \u00b0C. The conjugate surface was\nnormally regenerated with a 1 min injection of regeneration buffer (SDS 0.2 %-HCl 10 mM, pH\n2.5). To avoid the problem of regenerating the antibody bound to the sensor chip, an assay format\nwith the bound conjugate DA-HRP was investigated. The conjugate (150 mg.l-1) was covalently\nimmobilised to the dextran matrix and served as an affinity surface. Free protein ovalbumin was\nimmobilised onto a separate channel and was used as a control surface. The anti-domoic acid\nantibody (6.6 \uf06dg.ml-1), together with different concentrations of free domoic acid, was injected in a\nvolume of 35 \uf06dl and at a flow rate 5 \uf06dl.min-1. Binding and regeneration conditions were optimised\nin a separate set of experiments (data not shown).\nResults and discussion\nAlthough molecular recognition sensors based on molecularly imprinted polymer as recognition\nelements have been described in the past, they often rely on bulk polymers ground to desired\nparticle sizes and subsequently immobilised on the transducer surface by different means.\nUnfortunately, this approach cannot be used if the cost of the template is too high (as in the case of\ndomoic acid). The problem can be overcome by using a grafting procedure, which requires minimal\nquantities of the analyte to synthesise a thin polymer film in the surface of the transducing element.\nThe grafting procedure also aids in solving problems related to integrating MIPs with transducer as\nhomogenous ultra-thin films, especially for SPR detection. The photo-grafting procedure in\nprinciple is ideally suited for this task since it provides the possibility to control the deposition rate\nby controlling the time and intensity of UV exposure.\n9Polymer Grafting\nThe various steps involved in the grafting of a thin MIP layer were inspired by the techniques used\nin peptide coupling and protein synthesis. Having found a potential photo-initiator with symmetrical\ncarboxylic acid groups at each arm, it was possible to envisage a covalent attachment of the\npolymerisation initiator to the amino-functionalised gold surface through carbodiimide chemistry.\nOver the past decade, design of the optimal solvent mixture for peptide coupling and protein\nsynthesis has been extensively studied. Nozaki (Nozaki, 1999, Nozaki, 1997) showed that the\ncoupling yield of Boc-Ala-OH and H-Gly-Obz-L in equimolar quantity of HOBt and EDC was\n100% after 16 hours in pure DMF. This approach was therefore adjusted and employed successfully\nin this work where a mixture of EDC, HOBt, and 4,4\u2019-azo-bis (cyanovaleric acid) in DMF were\nallowed to stand-alone for one hour in order to activate the carboxylic groups of the photo-initiator.\nAfter this activation step, the amino-functionalised gold surface was introduced into the \u201ccoupling\u201d\nreaction mixture. After 16 hours in the dark, the covalent attachment of the photo-initiator to the\nsurface had taken place. The ultrasonication did not remove the covalently attached initiator and did\nnot reduce the quality of the final polymer coating obtained.\nCharacterisation of Grafting Technique by Static Contact Angle measurements and AFM Imaging\nTwo techniques were used for the characterisation of grafted films: contact angle\nmeasurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Table 1 presents the results of the contact\nangle measurements. Each step in the chemical derivatisation of the surface induced a change in the\nhydrophobic\/hydrophilic properties of the surface. The clean bare gold substrate was very\nhydrophilic and showed angles less than 20o, whereas once derivatised with 2-mercaptoethylamine\nthe angle changed radically to 43o. These values were in agreement with the published data on\nperformance of similar systems (Tsukruk, et al., 1998). The ensuing grafting of the MIP layer\nshowed another variation in the contact angle at 56o.\n10\nTable 1: Static contact angle measurements\nAFM images were obtained using contact mode scanning. These measurements provided a method\nof following the chemical modification step. Figures 2 A and B show the topographical\ncharacteristics of a 2 \u03bcm by 2 \u03bcm area of the MIP layer deposited. The general features have a\nmaximum differential height of 13 nm, which confirm the homogeneity of MIP films photo-grafted\nonto gold. The \u201cscrapping\u201d experiment was performed as described in Experimental section.\nFigure 2A and 2B: Planar (a) and 3D (b) topographic image of a gold chip with grafted MIP.\nFigure 3 presents the topographic (also called Z-image) on the left and the deflection images of a\nlarger area (right). The horizontal line allows a horizontal cross section profile to be drawn of the\nsurface as is depicted below each image. From the topographical image, it is possible to evaluate the\nMIP layer thickness.\nFigure 3: 6 \u00b5m x 6 \u00b5m AFM image of a 2 \u00b5m x 2 \u00b5m scraped area of a MIP grafted chip and the\ncross section analysis (below).\nThe left image in Figure 3 shows a neat \u201ccuvette\u201d corresponding to the scrapped area. The\ndifference between the two levels could be calculated from the Z position of the two cursors 1 and\n2, representing the levels of the un-scrapped and scrapped areas, respectively. In order to evaluate\nthe overall height difference between the two levels, we plotted the colour histogram in Figure 4,\nwhich give us a better evaluation of the polymer thickness. The low and high peaks represent the\nscrapped and un-scrapped areas respectively. The deflection image (right image on Figure 3) shows\nalso how the texture of the scrapped area has completely changed, revealing the bare gold\n11\nunderneath, when compared to the surrounding area covered by polymer. The thickness calculated\nfrom the topographic image is representative of the layer deposited.\nFigure 4: AFM histogram.\nSPR Study of Polymer-Domoic Acid Interactions\nGold chips coated with MIP and blank polymers were prepared and tested for their capability to\nrecognise domoic acid. Since domoic acid is a small molecule (FW= 311), which does not\nsignificantly change refractive index, a conjugate of domoic acid and HRP was used for analysis of\npolymer specificity. Either the conjugate DA-HRP or HRP were injected into the BIAcore 3000TM\n(80 \uf06dl) with a flow rate of 5 \uf06dl.min-1 (Figure 5).\nFigure 5: Specific binding of DA-HRP conjugate to grafted MIP compared to non-specific binding\nof native HRP. Error bars = \uf0b1SD, n=3.\nThe coated MIP chip displayed a specific binding of domoic acid-HRP conjugate, shown by the\nincrease in the response unit (RU) of the chip (RUmax > 450), whereas a much lower signal was\nobserved for native HRP enzyme (RUmax < 100). At a concentration of 200 mg.l-1 of conjugate, the\nmaximum difference (signal\/control) with the same concentration of free HRP was equal to 4.7. The\nconcentration of 200 mg.l-1 was subsequently used for the competitive reaction with the MIP optical\nsensor.\nThe regeneration was optimised by changing the volume and the flow of the injection as well as the\ncomposition of the regeneration solutions. Since the solution used for regeneration differs\nsignificantly in refractive index from running buffer, it gives a high positive bulk response.\n12\nA complete regeneration of MIP receptor was obtained after injecting 10 \uf06dl of 0.2% sodium dodecil\nsulphate (SDS) in 10mM HCl at a flow rate of 5 \uf06dl min-1. A faster flow rate did not give a complete\nregeneration even using larger volume. The regeneration solution did not appear to harm the\npolymer receptor sites since after more than 30 regenerations steps with SDS 0.2 % in HCl 10 mM,\na competition reaction was still observed on the coated MIP and no loss of signal was observed\n(Figure 6).\nFigure 6: Two consecutive regeneration phases alternated with one injection of the analyte.\nThe baseline level after regeneration should ideally be identical to that before the sample injection.\nProvided that the baseline is restored to the correct level when the response has stabilized, this did\nnot affect the kinetic determinations. A constant flow system running the PBS buffer containing\n0.05 % Tween 20 at 30 \uf06dl.min-1 facilitated washing away of the weak non-specific interactions. The\ncompetitive reaction was carried out by injecting into the flow cell of the BIAcore 3000TM system\nan equal volume of conjugate DA- HRP (200 mg.l-1) and a broad range of domoic acid\nconcentrations over a range of 1-100 \uf06dg.l-1. A regeneration step followed each of the analyte\ninjections; a space of approximately 5 minutes was left between injections. A calibration curve for\nthe competitive reaction on the MIP sensor is shown in Figure 7.\nFigure 7: Competitive calibration curve for the domoic acid MIP sensor.\nThe limit of detection calculated as an LLD80 corresponding to 5 \uf06dg.l-1 and the EC50 value was 58\n\uf06dg.l-1. The response curve is highly reproducible, as indicated by the relatively low standard\ndeviations and the mean % CV for the assay.\n13\nThe cross reactivity (CR) of the grafted polymer for the DA analogues kainic acid (KA), glutamic\nacid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) was also evaluated. Injections of equal volumes (150 \uf06dl) of HRP-\nDA conjugate and the target analytes (0 and 5 \uf06dg l-1) were introduced to the MIP sensor at flow rate\nof 30 \uf06dl min-1. The values of % cross-reactivity are summarised and compared to anti-domoic acid\nmonoclonal antibody performance in Table 2.\nThe stability of the polymer coating was analysed by storing gold chips at 4 \u00b0C for a period of up to\nthree months and by regular measurement of the sensor signal. A summary of the two receptor\u2019s\nperformances for DA detection is presented in Table 2.\nTable 2: Comparison between MIP and anti-DA antibody.\nConclusions\nArtificial MIP receptors represent an attractive alternative to antibodies since they can perform\nsimilarly to natural macromolecules, but provide better stability and in general are inexpensive to\nprepare. In the present paper, a new MIP receptor was designed for domoic acid and used for\ndevelopment of an evanescent (SPR) sensor for this compound. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nanalysis and contact angle analysis showed the resultant grafted MIP layer to be approximately 40\nnm thick and deposited homogeneously; it was thus suitable for SPR-based analyses. In term of\nsensitivity, the MIP had approximately three times higher detection limit (LLD80) compared to that\nof monoclonal antibody (5 \uf06dg l-1 versus 1.8 \uf06dg l-1 of domoic acid respectively). The calibration\ncurve for the MIP sensor showed a maximum value of approximately 400 RU, which was half of\nthe maximum RU value observed for the antibody. However, the detection range of the MIP sensor\nwas considerably improved (5-100 \uf06dg l-1) compared to the immunosensor. This was due to the\nvaried distribution of the polymer binding sites, which presented a variety of different affinities for\nthe target molecule, as previously discussed by Mosbach (Mosbach and Ramstrom, 1996).\n14\nWhen directly immobilised on the gold surface, the antibodies lost much of their activity after a few\nregeneration cycles. In contrast to the antibodies, MIPs appeared to be robust enough to withstand\nharsh treatment and multiple regeneration cycles.\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the European Union, Environmental and\nClimate programme (EN V4-CT98-0784).\nSergey Piletsky would like to acknowledge with gratitude receiving the Royal Society-Wolfson\nResearch Merit Award.\nReferences\nFalconer, I.
