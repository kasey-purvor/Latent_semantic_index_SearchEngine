Shiokawa,1 Y. Otsuka,1 T. Ogawa,1 S. Kawamura,2,4 M. Yamamoto,2 S. Fukao,2\nT. Nakamura,2 T. Tsuda,2 N. Balan,3 K. Igarashi,4 G. Lu,5 A. Saito,6 and K. Yumoto7\nReceived 24 April 2003; revised 11 July 2003; accepted 17 September 2003; published 4 December 2003.\n[1] A prominent large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbance (LSTID) was observed in\nJapan during the major magnetic storm (Dst \u0001 \u0002358 nT) of 31 March 2001. It was\ndetected as enhancements of the 630-nm airglow and foF2, GPS-TEC variations, and a\ndecrease in F-layer virtual height at 1700\u20131900 UT (0200\u20130400 LT). It moved\nequatorward with a speed of \u0001600 m\/s. The decrease in the F-layer height was also\ndetected by the MU radar at Shigaraki. Thermospheric wind variations were observed by\nthe MU radar through ion drift measurement and by a Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)\nthrough a Doppler shift of the 630-nm airglow line at Shigaraki. The wind data show a\nturn of the meridional wind from \u000294 m\/s (equatorward) to +44 m\/s (poleward) during the\nLSTID, indicating that an intense poleward wind in the thermosphere passed over\nShigaraki as an atmospheric gravity wave and caused the observed ionospheric features of\nthe LSTID. Intense poleward wind was also detected at mesospheric altitudes (95\u2013\n100 km) by the MU radar (through meteor echoes) and by the FPI (through the 558-nm\nairglow) with a delay of \u00012 hours from the thermospheric wind, indicating downward\nphase progression of the wave. Generation of the observed poleward wind in the auroral\nzone was investigated using magnetic field data and auroral energy input estimated by\nthe assimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics (AMIE) technique. We suggest\nthat simple atmospheric heating and\/or the Lorentz force in the auroral zone do not explain\nthe observed poleward wind enhancement.

Introduction\n[2] Large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances\n(LSTIDs) are characteristic disturbances in the storm-time\nionosphere at midlatitudes. They have a horizontal scale of\nmore than 1000 km and propagate equatorward with a\nvelocity of 400\u20131000 m\/s [Hunsucker, 1982; Hocke and\nSchlegel, 1996]. These disturbances are probably caused by\nthermospheric waves generated by the auroral-zone energy\ninput [e.g., Hooke, 1968; Francis, 1975; Reddy et al., 1990;\nRice et al., 1988; Pi et al., 2000; Oyama et al., 2001]. Ho et\nal. [1996, 1998] obtained a two-dimensional image of the\nLSTIDs as global total electron content (TEC) maps using\nthe multipoint GPS network.\n[3] Model calculations of LSTIDs also show equatorward\npropagation of thermospheric waves from the auroral-zone\nenergy input [e.g., Richmond, 1978; Millward et al., 1993;\nFuller-Rowell et al., 1994; Fujiwara et al., 1996; Balthazor\nand Moffett, 1999]. Richmond [1978] predicted that the\nwaves propagating equatorward at higher altitudes of the\nthermosphere precede those at lower altitudes. However,\nthere have been few observations of the vertical structure of\nLSTIDs. Emery et al. [1996, 1999], Buonsanto et al. [1997],\nand Lu et al. [2001] combined empirical models of auroral\nenergy input [e.g., Kamide et al., 1981; Richmond and\nKamide, 1988] with the thermosphere-ionosphere electro-\ndynamics general circulation model (TIEGCM) to describe\nstorm-time thermospheric disturbances and LSTID genera-\ntion. Most of these calculations show dominant enhance-\nment of \u2018\u2018equatorward wind\u2019\u2019 and associated upward motion\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 108, NO.

[2002] investigated a storm-\ntime LSTID event of 15 September 1999, using airglow\nimages, two-dimensional GPS-TEC maps, multipoint ion-\nosondes, a midlatitude ionospheric model, and an empirical\nmodel of auroral energy input. They concluded that the\ndrastic increases in airglow, TEC, and ionospheric peak\ndensity, and the decrease in ionospheric height, can be\nexplained by the passage of \u2018\u2018poleward\u2019\u2019 wind enhancement\n(250\u2013300 m\/s) associated with the LSTID. However, direct\nmeasurements of thermospheric wind were not available for\nthe previous observations of LSTIDs.\n[5] In this paper, we report a prominent LSTID event\nobserved in Japan during the magnetic storm of 31 March\n2001. Enhancements of airglow, TEC, and ionospheric peak\ndensity, and a decrease in ionospheric height, which were\nsimilar to those reported by Shiokawa et al. [2002], were\nobserved. Moreover, drastic enhancement of poleward wind\nwas measured by the Middle and Upper Atmosphere (MU)\nradar and a two-channel Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)\nfor two altitude ranges in the thermosphere and in the\nmesopause region, associated with the special MU radar\noperation for the Mesosphere-Thermosphere Experiments\nfor Coupling Studies (MTEC-S) campaign for 23 March to\n2 April 2001. The full description of the campaign is given\nby N. Balan (Simultaneous MLT and thermospheric F\nregion observations during geomagnetic storms, submitted\nto Journal of Geophysical Research, 2003). Temporal\nvariations of wind indicate a delay in the LSTID propaga-\ntion at lower altitudes. To discuss the generation of the\nobserved LSTIDs, we compare these midlatitude data with\nhigh-latitude data from ground magnetometers and from the\nassimilative mapping of ionospheric electrodynamics\n(AMIE) technique.\n2. Observations\n[6] Figure 1 shows the locations of the ground-based\nstations used in this paper. The airglow enhancement was\nobserved at Shigaraki (34.8\u0001N, 136.1\u0001E, geomagnetic lati-\ntude (MLAT) = 25.4\u0001N) and Sata (31.0\u0001N, 130.7\u0001E, 21.2\u0001\nMLAT). The MU radar and a Fabry-Perot interferometer\nwere also located at Shigaraki. Ionosonde measurements\nwere made at Wakkanai (45.4\u0001N, 141.7\u0001E, 36.5\u0001 MLAT),\nKokubunji (35.7\u0001N, 139.5\u0001E, 26.5\u0001 MLAT), and Okinawa\n(26.3\u0001N, 127.8\u0001E, 16.3\u0001 MLAT).\n[7] Figure 2 shows Dst indices (provisional) during the\nmagnetic storm of 30 March to 1 April 2001. The minimum\nDst was \u0002358 nT at 0900 UT on 31 March. The LSTID\nevent (as shown by the vertical dashed line) to be reported\nhere was observed during the main phase of the storm.\n2.1. Midlatitude Airglow\n[8] Three all-sky airglow imagers were used in this study.\nThey were developed in the Solar-Terrestrial Environment\nLaboratory, Nagoya University, as part of the Optical\nMesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs) [Shiokawa et\nal., 1999, 2000]. Imagers 1 and 4 were set at Shigaraki, and\nimager 2 was set at Sata. They obtained airglow images at\nwavelengths of 630 nm (emission altitude: 200\u2013300 km),\n558 nm (90\u2013100 km), and 777 nm (300\u2013400 km) with time\nresolutions of 5.5\u20136.5 min.\n[9] Figures 3b\u20133e show north-south cross sections (keo-\ngrams) of airglow images at these airglow lines on\n31 March 2001, at Shigaraki (Figures 3b and 3d) and Sata\nFigure 1. Map showing the locations of stations. The\nairglow data shown in Figures 3 and 4 were obtained at\nShigaraki (magnetic latitude (MLAT) = 25.4\u0001) and Sata\n(21.2\u0001 MLAT), where the fields of view of the airglow\nimaging (radius of 500 km) are shown. The ionogram data\nshown in Figure 7 were obtained at Wakkanai (36.5\u0001\nMLAT), Kokubunji (26.5\u0001 MLAT), and Okinawa (16.3\u0001\nMLAT).\nFigure 2. Three-day provisional Dst indices during the\nmagnetic storm of 30 March to 1 April 2001. The vertical\ndashed line indicates the time when the large-scale traveling\nionospheric disturbance (LSTID) was observed in Japan.\nSIA 3 - 2 SHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE\n(Figures 3c and 3e). The 630-nm images at Shigaraki are\nshown in Figure 3a. The intense 630-nm emission around\nthe northern horizon of Shigaraki (Figures 3a and 3b) was\nprobably from a stable auroral red (SAR) arc associated\nwith low-energy electron precipitation from the inner mag-\nnetosphere. The SAR arc was also detected by an all-sky\nimager and photometers at Rikubetsu (43.5\u0001N, 143.8\u0001E,\nHokkaido, Japan, near Wakkanai in Figure 1), though the\nsky at Rikubetsu was mostly cloudy. The 630-nm emission\nwas drastically enhanced at 1700\u20131830 UT (0200\u2013\n0330 LT) at Shigaraki and Sata, as shown in Figures 3b\nand 3c. The enhancement propagated southward at both\nstations. The southward propagation can be seen in the all-\nsky images in Figure 3a, though the emission around the\nedge of the images was high due to the line-of-sight\nintegration (van Rhijn effect). The enhancement was also\nseen in the 558-nm emission, particularly at Sata (Figures 3d\nand 3e). The 558-nm emission was unusually intense in the\nsouthern part of Japan (south of Shigaraki and around Sata)\nthroughout the night.\n[10] Figure 4 shows zenith airglow intensities extracted\nfrom Figure 3. The 630-nm enhancement was larger at\nSata (\u0001550 R) than at Shigaraki (\u0001300 R). It is note-\nworthy that the 777-nm airglow slightly decreased at\nShigaraki at this time. The 558-nm airglow intensity\nwas unusually intense (more than 500 R) even before\nthe LSTID passage over Sata. From the time difference of\nthe 630-nm airglow peak between Shigaraki and Sata, we\nestimate the southward component of LSTID velocity to\nbe \u0001640 m\/s.\n2.2. Total Electron Content (TEC)\n[11] To show large-scale features of the LSTID, we made\nmaps of TEC variations (Figure 5) during the 630-nm\nairglow enhancement of 31 March 2001. The GPS-TEC\nmeasurements were conducted by the Geographical Survey\nFigure 3. (a) All-sky airglow images at 630 nm and north-south cross sections (keograms) of all-sky\nimages for airglow emissions at (b) 630 nm at Shigaraki, (c) 630 nm at Sata, (d) 558 nm at Shigaraki, and\n(e) 558 nm at Sata. The Van Rhijn effect (effect of oblique line-of-sight integration of airglow layer) is not\ncorrected in the plotted data. These data were obtained by three all-sky imagers (imagers 1 and 4 at\nShigaraki and imager 2 at Sata) on 31 March 2001. The LSTID passed over Shigaraki and Sata from\nnorth to south at 1700\u20131830 UT (0200\u20130330 LT).\nSHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE SIA 3 - 3\nInstitute of Japan, using more than 1000 GPS receivers over\nJapan (GEONET) [Saito et al., 1998] with a time resolution\nof 30 s. A running average of TEC over 1 hour was\nsubtracted from the raw TEC values in order to avoid\ninstrumental biases [Saito et al., 1998]. The TEC variations\nestimated along the line-of-sight between the GPS satellites\nand the ground receivers are plotted at the location at an\naltitude of 300 km in Figure 5. The 30-s resolution maps are\nshown every 5 min in Figure 5.\n[12] In all the TEC maps, a continuous high-TEC region\ncan be seen at the northern edge of Japan at \u000144\u0001N. Apart\nfrom this, an enhanced region of TEC gradually appeared\naround 38\u0001N at 1705\u20131710 UT. It was significantly\nenhanced around 1720 UT (\u00011 TECU = 1 \u0003 1016 m\u00022)\nand moved equatorward continuously with a velocity of\n\u0001370\u2013560 m\/s (=2\u20133\u0001 latitude\/10 min). The latitudinal\nscale size of the TEC enhancement was \u0001600\u2013800 km, and\nthe peak of the enhancement was \u00011\u20132 TECU.\n[13] As stated above, the TEC map shown in Figure 5\nwas obtained by subtracting 1-hour running averages of\nTEC variation from the raw TEC data in order to avoid\ninstrumental biases. The instrumental biases vary signifi-\ncantly depending on the GPS receivers. The absolute TEC\nand TEC perturbations obtained at the location of Shigaraki\nare shown in Figures 6a and 6b, respectively. The TEC\nvariations in Figure 6b are the same as those plotted in\nFigure 5. The absolute TEC in Figure 6a was estimated by\ncorrecting the instrumental bias for each receiver using TEC\ndata from several GPS satellites at different elevation angles\n[Otsuka et al., 2002].\n[14] The TEC variations in Figure 6b show an enhance-\nment of TEC with an amplitude of \u00012 TECU at around\n1725 UT associated with the LSTID passage. The absolute\nTEC in Figure 6a shows a slight increase at 1700\u20131720 UT\nand a significant decrease from 32 TECU to 25 TECU at\n1720\u20131800 UT. Thus the actual TEC variations associated\nwith the LSTID were not only the enhancement but also a\nsubsequent significant decrease. The TEC enhancement of\n\u00012 TECU is \u00016% of the background (absolute) TEC value\n(\u000132 TECU) at Shigaraki. From the latitudinal profile of the\nabsolute TEC values (not shown), the TEC enhancement of\n1\u20132 TECU over Japan (Figure 5) was \u00012\u20136% from the\nbackground TEC values.\n2.3. Multipoint Ionosonde Observations\n[15] The ionospheric features during the LSTID were\ninvestigated using ionograms (every 15 min) obtained\nwith the three routine ionosondes, whose locations are\nshown in Figure 1. Figure 7 shows virtual heights at\n2 MHz and foF2 obtained at Wakkanai, Kokubunji, and\nOkinawa during the LSTID event of 31 March 2001. The\nvirtual height at 2 MHz and foF2 correspond to the\nrepresentative height of the nighttime bottomside F layer\nand the square root of the peak electron density of the F\nlayer, respectively.\n[16] The virtual height gradually increased and foF2\ngradually decreased for 0900\u20131400 UT (1800\u20132300 LT),\nwhich was expected from the recombination of F-region\ndensity after sunset. Then, the virtual height started to\ndecrease after 1500\u20131600 UT (0000\u20130100) LT at all\nthree stations. Note that the minimum of the virtual height\nat 1700\u20131900 UT came earlier at higher latitudes. After\nthe minimum, the virtual height suddenly increased to\nmore than 350 km at all stations. Just before the virtual\nheight minimum, foF2 showed a local peak at each station,\nwhich also came from higher latitudes to lower latitudes\nbetween 1600 and 1800 UT. The time of the virtual\nheight minimum corresponds to the time when the drastic\nenhancement of 630-nm airglow was observed. During\nthese drastic variations of the ionosphere after midnight,\nspread-F signatures were observed at Wakkanai. From\nthe time difference between the virtual height minimum\nat Wakkanai (1715 UT) and Okinawa (1815 UT), the\nequatorward velocity of the LSTID is estimated to be\n580 m\/s.\n2.4. F-Region Density Profile Obtained by the\nMU Radar\n[17] A more detailed view of the ionospheric F-layer was\nobtained from the incoherent scattering measurement using\nthe MU radar. Figure 8 shows contours of the electron\ndensity profile with a time resolution of 15 min observed by\nthe MU radar at Shigaraki on 31 March 2001. At this time,\nthe MU radar measurement had a 1.5 hour cycle, with 1 hour\nfor F-layer electron density and 0.5 hour for mesospheric\nmeteor echoes. In Figure 8, the no-observation interval of\n0.5 hour is linearly interpolated.\nFigure 4. Variations in 630-nm, 777-nm, and 558-nm\nairglow intensities at zenith obtained by all-sky airglow\nimagers at Shigaraki and Sata on 31 March 2001.\nSIA 3 - 4 SHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE\n[18] The F-layer height around sunset was 400\u2013450 km,\nwhich is rather high compared with the normal F-layer peak\nheight during magnetically quiet intervals [e.g., Kawamura\net al., 2000]. The F-layer electron density gradually\ndecreased and the peak height gradually increased after\nsunset from 1000 UT to 1300 UT, probably because of\nthe recombination loss of F-layer electrons. Between 1300\u2013\n1530 UT, the velocity of the height increase becomes\ngreater. At 1530 UT, the F layer started to descend to the\nlocal minimum at 1745 UT, when the 630-nm airglow\nenhancement was observed. The peak density temporally\nincreased at around 1645 UT. After 1745 UT, the F layer\nalmost disappeared, causing a sudden increase in peak\nheight. These variations of electron density in Figure 8 are\nconsistent with the variations of virtual height and foF2\nshown in Figure 7.\n3. Wind Measurements\n[19] For the LSTID event of 31 March 2001, several\nneutral wind data in the upper atmosphere were available.\nThey were obtained by the MU radar and by a two-channel\nFPI. Both instruments are located at Shigaraki. The MU\nradar measured electron density and ion drift velocity in the\nF layer, and neutral wind velocities in the mesosphere,\nalternatively, with a cycle time of 1.5 hours during the\nFigure 5. Two-dimensional maps of the total electron content (TEC) variations obtained by more than\n1000 GPS receivers (GEONET) in Japan during the passage of the large-scale traveling ionospheric\ndisturbance (LSTID) of 31 March 2001. A running average of TEC over 1 hour was subtracted from the\nraw TEC values, in order to avoid instrumental biases. The TEC values were mapped at an altitude of\n300 km along the line-of-sight between the satellite and the ground receivers.\nSHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE SIA 3 - 5\nMTEC-S campaign for 23 March to 2 April 2001. The\nobservation intervals were 1 hour and 0.5 hour for the F\nlayer and mesospheric wind measurements, respectively.\nThe procedure for deriving F-layer neutral wind velocity\nfrom the ion drift measurement is described by Oliver et al.\n[1998]. The mesospheric wind measurement obtained\nthrough meteor echoes is described by Nakamura et al.\n[1991]. The two-channel azimuth-scan FPI measured wind\nvelocities in the thermosphere and the mesopause region\nsimultaneously with a time resolution of 1 hour through the\nDoppler shift of the 630-nm and 558-nm airglow lines\n[Shiokawa et al., 2003]. The emission altitudes of these\nairglow lines are 200\u2013300 km (630 nm) and 90\u2013100 km\n(558 nm).\n3.1. Thermospheric Winds\n[20] Figure 9 shows northward wind velocities estimated\nfrom the F-layer ion drift measurement by the MU radar\n(thin and thick solid curves) and those measured by the FPI\nthrough the 630-nm airglow (thick dashed curve). The\noriginal time resolution of the MU radar data was 1.5 hours,\nwhile we took a running average of 4.5 hours (3 data points)\nthroughout the observation interval to reduce statistical\nnoise. The time resolution of the FPI was 1 hour. Because\nthe moon was in the sky before midnight, the FPI measure-\nment was started only after midnight.\n[21] In Figure 9, the wind variations on 31 March were\ndifferent from those seen on other days of the MTEC-S\ncampaign. The average wind variation for 23 March to\n1 April (thin solid curve with vertical bars indicating standard\ndeviations) shows a typical tidal variation (southward wind\naround midnight), though there was another magnetic storm\non 28 March (minimum Dst \u0001 \u0002100 nT). During the storm\nof 31 March, the MU wind (thick solid curve, 4.5-hour\nrunning average) shows large-amplitude wavelike variations,\ni.e., northward at 1200\u20131300 UT, highly southward at\n14\u201316 UT, and northward at 1900\u20132100 UT. Considering\nthat the northward (southward) wind pushes the F-layer\nupward (downward), these variations of meridional wind\nare fairly consistent with the observed height variations of\nthe F layer in Figure 8 (a rapid rise of the F layer at 1300\u2013\n1530 UT and a descent at 1530\u20131800 UT).\n[22] During the LSTID event of 1700\u20131900 UT, the MU\nwind shows a turn from southward to northward at 1600\u2013\n1900 UT. The FPI wind (thick dashed curve) shows a\nsteeper increase in the northward (poleward) wind for\n1546\u20131746 UT (from \u000294 m\/s to +44 m\/s) with a higher\ntime resolution of 1 hour. This sudden increase in poleward\nwind is consistent with the generation of LSTID signatures\nseen in the airglow, TEC, and height and peak density of the\nF layer, as discussed in section 5.1.\nFigure 6. (a) Absolute total electron content (TEC) and\n(b) perturbations of TEC obtained by the GPS receivers of\nGEONET above Shigaraki (34.8\u0001N, 136.1\u0001E), Japan on\n31 March 2001 (1 TECU = 1 \u0003 1016 m\u00022). The absolute\nTEC was estimated by correcting instrumental biases using\nthe method of Otsuka et al. [2002]. The TEC perturbations\nwere obtained by subtracting 1-hour running average from\nthe raw TEC data (same as those in Figure 5). The multiple\nvalues per each time correspond to different GPS satellites.\nFigure 7. Variations in the F-region virtual height at\n2 MHz and foF2 values obtained at three ionosonde stations\nin Japan during the large-scale traveling ionospheric\ndisturbance (LSTID) of 31 March 2001. The station\nlocations are shown in Figure 1.\nSIA 3 - 6 SHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE\n[23] The zonal wind measured by the FPI (not shown) on\n31 March was generally \u000140 m\/s westward after midnight,\nwith an enhancement of about another 30 m\/s westward\nonly at 1746 UT. The zonal ion drift measured by the MU\nradar also shows an enhancement of the westward drift\nvelocity at this time. The prevailing westward neutral wind\nwas explained as the ionospheric disturbance dynamo\ndescribed by Blanc and Richmond [1980]. Average storm-\ntime neutral winds were recently reported by Fejer et al.\n[2002] on the basis of the FPI measurements made at\nMillstone Hill (42.6\u0001N, 288.5\u0001E, 54\u0001 MLAT).\n3.2. Mesospheric Winds\n[24] Figure 10 shows the meridional wind profiles in the\nmesosphere obtained by the MU radar at Shigaraki through\nthe meteor echoes on 30 March to 1 April 2001. The time\nresolution of the MU radar data was 1.5 hours (a 0.5 hour\nmeasurement every 1.5 hours). Diurnal tide variations with\na downward phase progression were seen in this plot.\nEmbedded in this diurnal variation was an unusually strong\nnorthward wind, observed at altitudes higher than 95 km\n(shown by the black arrow) at 1945 UT on 31 March which\nis just after the LSTID passage of 1700\u20131900 UT. The wind\nvelocity increases with increasing altitude, and it exceeds\n80 m\/s at altitudes above 98 km.\n[25] Figure 11 shows northward wind velocities measured\nby the MU radar at an altitude of 96 km and those measured\nby the FPI through the 558-nm airglow, in the same format\nas that in Figure 9. Just after the LSTID passage of 1700\u2013\n1900 UT, the MU wind (thick solid curve) drastically\nincreased up to 74 m\/s (poleward) at 1945 UT. This increase\nin wind was also seen in the FPI data, though the FPI\nmeasurement stopped after 1900 UT because of sunrise.\nFigure 8. Nighttime electron density profile (15-min resolution) in the ionospheric F layer measured by\nthe MU radar at Shigaraki, Japan, during the magnetic storm of 31 March 2001. The solid curve indicates\nthe peak heights of the electron density. The MU radar measurement was a 1.5 hour cycle, with 1 hour for\nthe density profile and 0.5 hour for mesospheric meteor echoes. In this figure, the no-observation interval\nof 0.5 hour was linearly interpolated.\nFigure 9.

High-Latitude Disturbances\n[26] To show geomagnetic activity during the LSTID\nevent, we plotted the H-component magnetic field varia-\ntions of 31 March 2001 in Figure 12.

[1996]\nfor details) were obtained mostly in the Japanese meridian\nof 0200\u20130300 magnetic local times (MLTs) in Siberia\n(auroral zone, TIX, and CHD), southern Siberia (ZYK\nand MGD), Japan (MSR, RIK, and KAG), and Australia\n(BSV). Low-latitude data in the morning sector at Hawaii\n(EWA, 6.9 MLT) are also shown.\n[27] The LSTID passage over Japan was 1700\u20131900 UT.\nAt 1540\u20131700 UT, an intense substorm was observed with\na negative H bay at TIX, CHD, ZTK, and MGD. Positive H\nexcursions, which are usually seen in the low-latitude\nmagnetograms associated with substorms, were observed\nat the low-latitude stations (MSR, RIK, KAG, EWA, and\nBSV) at this time. Note that the negative H bay was also\nobserved at MGD (53.8\u0001 MLAT), indicating that the auroral\nelectrojet current came down to lower latitudes during the\nmain phase of the large magnetic storm.\n[28] In order to see the energy input in the auroral zone, we\nshow the Northern Hemisphere auroral Joule heating rate,\ncross polar-cap potential, and AU\/AL indices calculated by\nthe AMIE technique [Richmond and Kamide, 1988] in\nFigure 13. The AMIE procedure calculates these parameters\nfrom ground magnetometer data using the inversion tech-\nnique by considering ionospheric conductivity. The high-\nlatitude magnetometer data shown in Figure 12 are also used\nin this empirical model.\n[29] The polar-cap potential and auroral Joule heating\ngenerally show high values of more than 100 kV and\n500 GW during the plotted interval, because of the main\nphase of the large magnetic storm. The AU\/AL indices in\nthe top panel show an intense substorm that started at\n1540 UT. This substorm causes the enhancements of auroral\nJoule heating from 500 GW to 1000 GW and the polar-cap\npotential drop from 120 kV to 150 kV, with even higher\nvalues around 1820 UT.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Wind Measurement\n[30] Figure 14 is a summary plot of the observed features\nof the LSTID of 31 March 2001. The LSTID at 1700\u2013\n1900 UT (0200\u20130400 LT) observed in Japan was charac-\nterized by enhancements of 630-nm airglow and foF2,\nFigure 10. Northward wind velocities in the mesopause region measured by the MU radar through\nmeteor echoes at Shigaraki on 30 March to 1 April 2001. The arrow indicates the time when intense\nnorthward wind was observed at high altitudes associated with the LSTID passage.\nFigure 11. Northward wind velocities in the mesopause\nregion measured by the MU radar and by the Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer (FPI) at Shigaraki. The MU radar wind at an\naltitude of 96 km is measured through meteor echoes. The\nthin solid curve is averages of MU radar winds for 24 March\nto 1 April 2001 (except for 31 March), where the vertical\nbars indicate standard deviations. The thick solid curve with\ncircles is the MU radar wind of 31 March 2001. The thick\ndashed curve with Xs is the FPI wind measured through\nthe Doppler shift of 558-nm airglow emission (emission\naltitude: \u000190\u2013100 km).\nSIA 3 - 8 SHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE\nGPS-TEC variations, and a decrease in F-layer virtual\nheight. These characteristics are similar to those seen in the\nLSTID event of 15 September 1999, reported by Shiokawa et\nal. [2002]. We also measured F-layer electron density\nprofiles observed by the MU radar for the present event.\nThe profiles show a sudden descent of the F layer during the\npassage of the LSTID. During the descent of the F layer,\npoleward wind enhancement (from \u000294 m\/s to +44 m\/s)\nwas observed in the thermosphere by the MU radar and the\nFPI. To our knowledge, they are the first combined measure-\nments of LSTID images and neutral wind at midlatitudes.\n[31] As illustrated in Figure 9 of Shiokawa et al. [2002],\nthe poleward wind pushes the ionosphere down along the\nfield line at midlatitudes. This F-layer descent causes\nairglow enhancement by supplying the high-density plasma\nat the F-layer peak (\u0001400 km) to the airglow emission layer\nat \u0001250 km. The F-layer peak electron density ( foF2)\ntemporally increases to keep the pressure balance along\nthe field line (\u2018\u2018compression\u2019\u2019 of the F layer). Such en-\nhancement of the F-layer peak was also detected by the MU\nradar (Figure 8, around 1645 UT). The F-layer descent\ncauses a pressure decrease at the high-altitude ionosphere,\nwhich results in the observed slight TEC enhancement by\nthe supply of electrons from the higher altitudes and from\nthe other hemisphere along the field line. The F-layer peak\nelectron density and TEC are then significantly decreased\nbecause of the severe recombination at lower altitudes.\n[32] We detected the poleward wind enhancement not\nonly in the thermosphere but also in the mesopause region,\nwhere it was delayed \u00012 h from that in the thermosphere.\nSuch a delay at lower altitudes was predicted by Richmond\n[1978], who used numerical simulation of large-scale grav-\nity waves in the thermosphere. He showed that the phase\nfront of the equatorward moving waves at a 100-km altitude\nwas delayed \u000120\u0001 in latitude from that at a 250-km altitude\nat midlatitudes (see Figure 7 of Richmond [1978]). This\ndelay was because an upward propagating gravity wave\n(generated at an auroral-zone heat source at altitudes of\n100\u2013160 km in his simulation) has a downward propagat-\ning phase front [Hines, 1960]. The phase delay of \u000120\u0001 in\nlatitude in his simulation causes a time delay of \u00011 h at\naltitudes between 401 and 209 km at 46\u0001N. For the present\nevent, the phase delay from a 250-km altitude to a 96-km\naltitude was \u00012 h at 35\u0001N (Shigaraki). The amplitude of\npoleward wind enhancement at 209-km altitude is 1\/6 of\nthat at 401 km in the work of Richmond [1978]. For the\npresent event, the wind enhancement at a 250-km altitude\nwas 138 m\/s (FPI measurement at 630 nm). The enhance-\nment at the mesospheric altitudes would be well less than\nFigure 13.

[1990] reported similar variations\nof the midlatitude ionosphere during the magnetic storm\nof 20\u201321 January 1989. They showed a rapid increase in\nthe F-layer height from 1400 UT (370 km) to 1600 UT\n(600 km) and a sudden decrease in the height from\n1600 UT (600 km) to 1730 UT (less than 350 km)\nobserved by the MU radar (their Figure 4). These features\nare quite similar to those of the present event. Using the\ndensity variations obtained from the MU radar, Reddy et\nal. [1990] estimated the meridional wind velocity (by\nassuming that the east-west electric field = 0 mV\/m) and\nthe east-west electric field (by assuming that the merid-\nional wind = 0 m\/s). In the present paper, we show the\nmeridional wind velocities from the direct measurements\nmade by the MU radar and the FPI. Their result (Figure 9\nof Reddy et al. [1990]) shows variation of meridional\nwind quite similar to our Figure 9, but the amplitude\nwas much larger (\u00b1200 m\/s). For the present event, we\ncan safely conclude that the LSTID was not caused by\nthe global east-west electric field imposed on the iono-\nsphere from magnetospheric disturbances, because of the\nclear southward propagation of the observed ionospheric\ndisturbances.\n[34] The slight decrease in the 777-nm airglow at the\npassage of the LSTID (Figure 4) can also be explained by\nthe F-layer decrease, because the 777-nm emission intensity\nis proportional to the square of the F-layer peak electron\ndensity [e.g., Sahai et al., 1981]. However, the 777-nm\nintensity recovers and further increases after the LSTID\npassage, though the F-layer density does not recover in\nFigure 8. At midlatitudes, the 777-nm intensity is relatively\nweak compared with that at equatorial latitudes. Because the\nOH(9\u20134) P2(2) line (wavelength: 778.2 nm) falls into the\npass band of our 777.4-nm filter, the observed 777-nm\nintensity is probably highly contaminated by the OH air-\nglow emission from the mesopause region. The recovery of\nthe 777-nm intensity after the LSTID passage may be\nbecause of this contamination.\n[35] The 558-nm airglow intensity was unusually intense\non this night, particularly in the southern part of Japan\n(maximum 870 R at Sata). This intense 558-nm airglow\ncannot be explained by the F-region contribution of the\n558-nm airglow in the equatorial anomaly region because\nthe F-region contribution of 558-nm airglow is usually 20\u2013\n30% of the 630-nm airglow. There seems to be some\nunknown mechanism that causes further excitation of\nO(1S) at midlatitudes during this storm.\n[36] It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the TEC\nvariations in Figure 5 becomes larger at lower latitudes.\nThis may correspond to the latitudinal gradient of back-\nground TEC because if the TEC variation is caused by\nmeridional wind variations, it would become larger under\nthe large-background TEC. However, there is no discernible\nTEC enhancement in the northern part of Japan before\n1705 UT. In addition, the 630-nm airglow enhancement is\nlarger at lower latitudes (Sata), as shown in Figure 4. The\nobserved increase of the amplitudes in TEC and airglow at\nlower latitudes may suggest enhancement of the meridional\nwind variation, which may correspond to the nonlinear\nFigure 14.

Source in the Auroral Zone\n[37] The atmospheric wave that caused the observed\nLSTID was probably generated by the auroral-zone energy\ninput. From the UV auroral images obtained by the POLAR\nsatellite (not shown), the auroral oval expanded down to the\ngeographic latitude of \u000160\u0001 (\u000150\u0001 MLAT) in the Japanese\nmeridian at 1600 UT. This was confirmed by the fact that an\nintense auroral electrojet was observed at MGD (59.9\u0001\nGLAT, 53.8\u0001 MLAT), as shown in Figure 12. If we take\nthe equatorward velocity of the LSTID to be 600 m\/s, it\ntakes \u00011.3 hours to propagate from 60\u0001 GLAT to 35\u0001 GLAT\n(Shigaraki). Since the LSTID was observed at Shigaraki at\n1730\u20131800 UT, it was probably generated in the auroral\noval around 1600\u20131630 UT, when an intense storm-time\nsubstorm took place.\n[38] LSTID simulations with auroral energy input gener-\nally predict \u2018\u2018equatorward\u2019\u2019 wind enhancement during the\nauroral energy input because of the expansion of the heated\natmosphere. Some have predicted poleward wind enhance-\nment at midlatitudes after passage of the initial equatorward\nwind, due to rarefaction [e.g., Richmond, 1978; Millward et\nal., 1993]. In the thermospheric wind data in Figure 14c, the\nequatorward wind enhancement was seen at 1300\u20131600 UT,\nbefore the poleward wind enhancement at 1700\u20131800 UT.\nHowever, it is impossible to connect this equatorward wind\nat 1300\u20131600 UT to the intense substorm starting at\n1540 UT. The Joule heating estimated by AMIE shows a\nsmall enhancement at 1300\u20131400 UT in the auroral zone\n(Figure 14b), which may correspond to the equatorward\nwind enhancement observed in Japan at 1300\u20131600 UT\n(Figure 14c). However, it is not likely that this small\nauroral-zone heating at 1300\u20131400 UT caused the intense\npoleward wind enhancement observed in Japan at 1700\u2013\n1800 UT through the rarefaction.\n[39] The other mechanism that can cause \u2018\u2018poleward\u2019\u2019\nwind during auroral energy input is the Lorentz force in the\nauroral zone. As discussed by Hunsucker [1982], the\nLorentz force (J \u0003 B), where J is the auroral current density\nand B is the magnetic field intensity, can be transferred to\nthe neutral gas via collisions. This force can be imposed in\nthe auroral zone to cause LSTIDs, which propagate equa-\ntorward as traveling atmospheric waves. For the present\nevent, however, the auroral-zone current J associated with\nthe storm-time substorm around 1600\u20131630 UT is clearly\nwestward, as shown by negative-bay variations in the\nH-component (northward component) magnetic field in\nFigure 12. The westward electrojet current causes an\n\u2018\u2018equatorward\u2019\u2019 J \u0003 B force in the northern hemisphere.\n[40] From the timing and the propagation velocity, it is\nquite conceivable that the LSTID observed in Japan at\n1700\u20131800 UT is related to the intense storm-time sub-\nstorm at 1600\u20131630 UT. However, neither Joule heating\nnor the Lorentz force explains the generation of the\nobserved LSTID (poleward wind enhancement) in the\nauroral zone. There may be some wave-wave coupling\nand modulation of gravity waves due to complicated spatial\nand temporal structures of auroral energy input, as discussed\nby Rice et al. [1988] and Jing and Hunsucker [1993]. To\ninvestigate this missing link between the middle and high\nlatitudes, we need to compare our observations with global\ncirculation models of the upper atmosphere using observed\nparameters of auroral energy input, as was done by Emery et\nal. [1996, 1999], Buonsanto et al. [1997], and Lu et al.\n[2001].\n6. Conclusions\n[41] We have reported a prominent LSTID event with\nneutral wind data in the midlatitude thermosphere and the\nmesopause region during the magnetic storm of 31 March\n2001. The observed features of the LSTID and related\nphenomena are summarized as follows.\n[42] 1. Drastic airglow enhancements of 100 ! 400 R\n(Shigaraki) and 200 ! 750 R (Sata) propagating equator-\nward (\u0001640 m\/s) were observed by all-sky imagers at 1700\u2013\n1900 UT (0200\u20130400 LT). The 558-nm airglow increased\nin association with the LSTID, while the 777-nm airglow\nslightly decreased. Intense 558-nm airglow (870 R) was\nobserved in the southern part of Japan.\n[43] 2. The GPS-TEC maps over Japan showed a slight\nenhancement and subsequent decrease in TEC with a\nmeridional scale size of \u0001600\u2013800 km, propagating equa-\ntorward with a velocity of \u0001370\u2013560 m\/s at 1710\u2013\n1740 UT. The TEC variations were \u00011\u20132 \u0003 1016 m\u00022\n(\u00012\u20136% of background TEC).\n[44] 3. The F-layer virtual height at 2 MHz decreased\nfrom \u0001400 km to \u0001200 km at 1700\u20131900 UT at three\nionosonde stations in Japan. The minimum of the virtual\nheight moved equatorward with a velocity of \u0001580 m\/s.\nThe foF2 values increased just before the virtual height\nminimum.\n[45] 4. The descent of the F layer associated with the\nLSTID was clearly observed at 1530\u20131745 UT (0030\u2013\n0245 LT) by the MU radar at Shigaraki. Before the LSTID,\nthe F-layer height rapidly increased at 1300\u20131530 UT.\n[46] 5. The thermospheric neutral wind was estimated\nfrom the ion drift measurement by the MU radar and was\nmeasured by the FPI through the 630-nm airglow. The data\nindicated a sudden enhancement of the poleward neutral\nwind of \u0001140 m\/s at 1700\u20131800 UT during the LSTID\npassage. The meridional wind showed large-amplitude\nwavelike variations throughout the night (northward at\n1200\u20131300 UT, highly southward at 1400\u20131600 UT, and\nnorthward at 1900\u20132100 UT).\n[47] 6. The mesospheric neutral wind (around an altitude\nof \u000196 km) was measured by the MU radar through meteor\nechoes and by the FPI through the 558-nm airglow. The data\nalso showed sudden enhancement of the poleward wind at\n2000 UT, \u00012 hours after the poleward wind enhancement in\nthe thermosphere.\n[48] 7. Ground magnetic field data and AMIE outputs\nshowed that an intense substorm took place at 1540\u2013\n1700 UT, which corresponds to the onset time of the LSTID\nestimated by backtracing the LSTID propagation observed\nin Japan to the auroral zone.\n[49] These observed features of the LSTID are similar to\nthose reported by Reddy et al. [1990] and Shiokawa et al.\n[2002]. In addition, this work reports the first simultaneous\nmeasurement of the neutral wind and LSTID images at\nmidlatitudes. The 630-nm airglow enhancement, 777-nm\nairglow decrease, F-layer descent, TEC variations, and\nSHIOKAWA ET AL.: TRAVELING IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE SIA 3 - 11\ntemporal increase of foF2 are probably caused by the\nobserved poleward wind enhancement in the thermosphere,\nas suggested by Shiokawa et al. [2002] (their Figure 9). The\nobserved time delay of the mesospheric wind enhancement\nis consistent with the vertical phase front distribution of\nthe upward propagating gravity wave, as predicted by\nRichmond [1978]. However, simple atmospheric heating\nand\/or the Lorentz force in the auroral zone do not explain\nthe observed poleward wind enhancement at midlatitudes.\nA comparison with global thermospheric models will be\nneeded for further investigation.\n[50] Acknowledgments.
