Circuit technologies \noften need the antenna to be of small scale whilst offering high performance. In \nthis paper, we propose a novel antenna structure capable of high radiation \nefficiency suitable for use in multilayer microwave circuits. The traveling wave \nfeed system offers high quality circular polarization which is a key feature of \nmany existing and developing mobile communication systems. The proposed \ndesign can be fabricated using thick film technology, thus satisfying the high \nvolume demand of microwave circuits at a lower cost. \n \nThe proposed antenna uses a low permittivity dielectric layer on a high \npermittivity substrate to improve the fringing fields at the edges of the radiation \npatches. The work is an extension of the concept using strips of low dielectric \nconstant material underneath the radiation edges of a patch to enhance \nradiation efficiency[1]. In the proposed design the low dielectric constant \nmaterial is placed above the high permittivity substrate forming a multilayer \nstructure. The antenna design uses a circular slotline channel beneath the high \npermittivity substrate to excite the rectangular patches. A theoretical \ninvestigation based on electromagnetic simulation was performed to validate \nthe new radiation efficiency enhanced antenna at 10GHz. \n \nAntenna Structure And Theory \n \nThe structure of the radiation enhanced circular polarized antenna is illustrated \nin figure[1]. The configuration of the antenna is composed of 8 planar \nrectangular radiating patches. Each patch is linearly polarized and consists of \ndimensions Lp and Wp, where Lp is the resonant dimension and Wp is the width \nof the patch, the radiating edge. The patches are excited with a progressive \nphase lag of 450 because there is an annular spacing of \u03bb\/8 between the patches, \nthus leading to circular polarization. The basic design concept of the antenna \nwas originally established by K. Lum and C. Free[2]. The antenna feed is by a \ncircular slotline channel, of width Ws, runs in the ground plane beneath the \npatches. The slotline is excited through a conventional microstrip-to-slotline \ntransition. The slotline is offset by an increment of 120\u00b5m so that a portion of \nthe signal travelling in the slotline will successively excite each patch, \ntherefore compensating for the progressive loss of signal in the slotline.   \n7411-4244-0878-4\/07\/$20.00 \u00a92007 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The key antenna dimensions: \nLength of the patch Wp = 6.9mm \nWidth of the patch   Lp = 2.9mm \nWidth of the slotline  Ws = 0.4mm \nDiameter of the circular slotline channel =  37mm \nCircuit dimensions  = 50.8mm x 50.8mm \nAs illustrated in figure[2] a low dielectric constant material was placed beneath \nthe patches to improve the efficiency of the radiation. One of the key \nparameters of radiation loss is the dielectric constant. The lower the dielectric \nconstant the less the concentration of energy is in the substrate region. \nTherefore more radiation loss occurs. The high dielectric constant substrate \nmaterial reduces the radiation loss. This is because the most of the EM field is \nconcentrated in the dielectric between the conductive patch and the ground \nplane. The low dielectric constant material used was KQ150(Heraeus Inc) with \na dielectric constant of 3.9. Dielectric layer thickness was set to 50\u00b5m. The \npresence of the low dielectric material increases the intensity of the electric \nfield distribution at the radiating patch edges. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \nFigure[1] \u2013 Configuration of the antenna \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure[2] \u2013 Configuration of the layers                  Figure[3]-Definition of Incremental Offset     \n                                                                                      between slotline channel and patch \n \n \n742\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

This is slightly different from \nthe designed value of 10GHz because no matching was included to account for \nthe reactance presented by the patches to the feed line. As seen from figure[4], \nthe return loss of the antenna is -24.25dB at 9.9GHz. As seen from figure[5], \nthe return loss of the antenna with the low dielectric constant material \nunderneath its patches, is -38.8dB at the optimum frequency of operation \nwhich is 9.9GHz. It can be observed that the return loss demonstrates an \nincrement of 60% at 9.9GHz. The radiation efficiency has increased by 12%. It \nwas found that an adequate combination of good return loss and radiation \nefficiency existed in the new multilayer antenna structure. \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this paper a radiation enhancement method using low dielectric constant \nmaterial is demonstrated. Excellent return loss and improved radiation \nefficiency was obtained from the novel multilayer design structure. The \nproposed structure is suitable for compact multilayer microwave structures. \n \nReferences \n \n1. K.M. Lum; T. Tick; C. Free; H.
