These experimental results\nare important input for the final design of the LHC beam screen.\n1 INTRODUCTION\n The high flux of synchrotron radiation (SR) in the arc of the LHC, about 1017 photons\/(s m),\ncauses photoelectron emission from the walls of the beam screen. The emitted low energy electrons are\naccelerated in the field of the proton beam and may gain energies sufficient to create secondary\nelectrons on the subsequent interaction with the beam screen, resulting in the creation of an electron\ncloud. The repeated recurrence of this process can result in beam\u2013induced multipacting [1].\nTheoretical simulations of the electron cloud in the LHC predict significant heat loads on the\ncryogenic system and electron stimulated gas desorption [2], [3], [4]. Experimental data are required as\ninput to such simulations in order to estimate the influence of an electron cloud on the LHC operation.\nA large portion of the LHC beam vacuum system is located inside the dipole magnets. Previous studies\nhave shown that the presence of the dipole field has a strong influence on the electron emission [5],\n[6]. In addition the heat loads in the dipole field are predicted to be strongly dependent on the\nazimuthal distribution of photons, determined by the photon reflectivity [2,3,4]. Experiments were\nperformed to investigate the influence of a dipole field on the electron emission of various samples\n2with different surface roughness [7] and to measure both the photon reflectivities and the effect of a\ndipole field from beam screen material with or without a saw\u2013tooth surface structure [8]. These latter\nexperiments were performed with SR at grazing incidence in order to simulate closely the geometry in\nthe LHC. However, here the strength of the dipole field is significantly smaller than that in the LHC\n(0.3T versus 8.3T) and that the experiment was performed at room temperature and not at cryogenic\ntemperatures. The saw\u2013tooth structure has been proposed as an efficient method of reducing the\nforward scattered photon reflection in the LHC and hence adsorbing most of the photons on the\nequatorial plane of the beam screen.\nThe results on the influence of the dipole field on the photoelectron yield, performed with normal\nincident photons, are presented in section 2. In section 3 the results of the photoelectron yield and\nphoton reflectivities from beam screen material with or without a saw\u2013tooth surface structure,\nperformed with grazing incident photons, are presented. A brief discussion and conclusions are made\nin section 4.\n \n2 Experiments performed with normal incident photons\n2.1 Set-up and sample preparation\nThe experimental set-up shown in Figure 1 was built on the beamline P2 of VEPP-2M to study\nthe dependence of the photoelectron emission for photons at normal incidence as a function of a\ntransverse dipole field (up to 0.6 T). The sample was mounted on a sample holder, electrically isolated\nfrom the surrounding 46 mm diameter stainless steel chamber, and located in the centre of the\nmagnetic field. An all-metal valve was used to isolate the vacuum of the experimental chamber and\nthat of the beamline. The distance from the SR source to the collimator is about 11 m. The sample,\nwith vertical and horizontal dimensions of 44 mmu15 mm, respectively is mounted on the sample\nholder with its surface perpendicular to the incident SR. The photon flux from VEPP\u20132M is collimated\nresulting in a 35mmu10mm area of the sample to be illuminated, i.e. the edges of the sample are not\nirradiated.\nThe increased vertical size of the photon beam and the sample was chosen to avoid attenuating\nthe lower energy part of the spectrum. The sample was connected via an ammeter to a voltage supply\n(r300 V). Hence, the potential on the sample could be controlled whilst the electron current from, or\nto, the sample could be measured. The magnetic field of 0 to 0.6 T was aligned approximately parallel\nto the sample surface and in the vertical direction. The experimental chamber has a reduced cross-\nsection near the magnet centre to provide a stronger and more uniform magnetic field (see Figure 1).\n3                   \nFigure 1: The layout of the installation.\nSeven different samples were studied: a 316 series stainless steel, four made of copper co\u2013\nlaminated stainless steel (the proposed material for the LHC beam screen), one machined from OFHC\ncopper and a stainless steel electroplated with gold. The samples were degreased and cleaned with\nbenzine and alcohol before installation.\nTable 1: Definition and description of the samples studied.\nSample name Sample description\nSS Stainless steel (316 series) sample made from a rolled sheet\nCu\/SS-1 Copper co\u2013laminated stainless steel with the rolling direction perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field.\nCu\/SS-2 Copper co\u2013laminated stainless steel with the rolling direction parallel to the\nmagnetic field.\nCu\/SS-3 Copper co\u2013laminated stainless steel baked in air at 300\u2022 C for 5 mins. with the\nrolling direction parallel to the magnetic field.\nCu\/SS-4 Copper co\u2013laminated stainless steel made with turned-in, long edges, i.e. 5 mm\nwide strips at the long edges were turned to 10\u201315q towards the SR with the rolling\ndirection parallel to the magnetic field.\nOFHC OFHC copper machined with longitudinal grooves aligned parallel to the magnetic\nfield.

It was estimated as a\nratio of the measured output current Imes (i.e. electron flux from or to the sample) to photon flux *\u0006 .\nNeither the effect of the beamline collimation nor the sample workfunction is taken into account in the\nestimation of the photoelectron yield, contrary to that in other studies [5].\n*\u0098\n \n\u0006e\nmesIphotonelectrons ]\/[N ,\nwhere e is the electron charge.\nThe photoelectron yield was studied as a function of the different parameters:\n1. Potential on the sample (or bias) from \u2013300 V to +300 V at fixed dipole field between 0 and  0.6 T;\n2. Magnetic field from 0 up to 0.6 T at a fixed potential between 0 and \u2013300 V.\n3.

It decreases\nrapidly with the dipole field when the magnetic field changes from 0 to about 0.1 to 0.2 T, then\ndecreases slowly, and is practically constant between 0.4 and 0.6 T. Since this suppression at low\nfields can be attributed to electrons being constrained to move along the field lines and hence return to\nthe strip from which they were emitted it is therefore thought unlikely that the yield will change for\n5higher magnetic fields. The dependence of the photoelectron emission on the photon dose was found in\ncomparing the data without the magnetic field at the beginning of the measurements. After a dose of\n1022 photons the photoelectron emission yield reduces by about a factor of 2. The main results are\nshown in Table 2.\n3 Experiments performed with grazing incident photons\n3.1 Set-up and sample preparation\nThe experimental set-up (shown in Figure 2), installed at the end of a second, short SR beam line,\nwas located at a distance of about 1 m from the SR source point where the effect of the vertical\ncollimation on the photon flux is negligible. Here the dimensions of the SR beam is defined by a set of\nhorizontal (Ch) and vertical (Cv) collimators, 2 mm and 10 mm respectively, on entering the\nexperimental system. The photon flux, through the collimators, was typically 1016 photons\/s.\n \nFigure 2: Set-up for measurements of the photon reflectivity and azimuthal photoelectron\ndistribution in a magnetic field.\n3.2 Results\nThe position of the photon beam with respect to the experimental system could be checked with\ntwo luminescent screens, (LD1) and (LD2). At the exit of the test system, a calorimeter (CAL) was\ninstalled to monitor the SR. This calorimeter was designed in such a way that it could either measure\n6the total SR power or the total photon flux derived from the photoelectron current produced on the\ncalorimeter. For the latter measurement the calorimeter was electrically biased with respect to the test\nchamber. A section of a prototype LHC beam screen, 34 cm in length, was cut into four strips: two\nrounded and two flat (see Figure 3). In a following experiment strip 1 was replaced with a flat strip of\nbeam screen material with a saw\u2013tooth structure on its surface. A dipole magnet with a field of up to\n0.3 T was installed along the whole length of the vacuum chamber containing the strips. Strips 2 and 4\nwere perpendicular to magnetic field. The rounded strip 3 was opposite to strip 1. The whole\nexperimental system could be positioned either aligned straight or inclined at a given grazing angle\nwith respect to the axis of the photon beam. In the straight position, the SR beam traversed the test\nsystem and was incident on the end calorimeter, while in the inclined position, the photon beam was\nincident at an angle of about 10 mrad along strip 1 only reflected photons are able to reach the\ncalorimeter.\nFigure 3: ample configuration for experiments of the photon reflectivity and azimuthal\nphotoelectron distribution in a magnetic field.\nDuring a typical measurement, the SR beam was incident on strip 1. The remaining strips received\nonly reflected photons. Applying a negative bias in turn to each of the four strips while maintaining all\nothers at the common ground potential, the photoelectron current produced by photons on the\ncorresponding strip was measured. Assuming that the average photoelectric yield for the direct\nincident photons and for the reflected photons are not too different, it is possible to derive from the\nmeasured azimuthal distribution of the photoelectron signal the azimuthal distribution of the photons.\nThe measurements were performed for a bias voltage from 0 to 290 V and with the magnetic field of\nB = 0 to 0.3 T.\nA\nStrip 2\nStrip 4\nA\nStrip 1\nStrip 3\n7Forward scattered reflection is defined as a ratio of measured values on the calorimeter, by current\nor power, in the two positions:\n.\/\n;\/\ndirrefW\ndirrefe\nWWR\nIIR\n \n \nDiffuse photon reflectivity is defined as:\nYe\nIIIR 432dif\n\u0098*\u0098\n\u000e\u000e\n \n\u0006\nThe yield is defined per adsorbed photon as:\n\u000b \f\n\u000b \f*\u0010\n \n\u00a6\n \n\u0006\ne\n4\n1i\ni\nR1\neI\nY ,\nwhere the currents Ii from strips were measured at a bias of \u2013300 V.\nThe main results are shown in Table 3.

The\ndipole field does not affect the photoelectron current from strips 2 and 4, top and bottom.\n84 Discussion and Conclusions\nThe experiments with SR at normal incidence show that the different materials with the different\nsurfaces have about the same photoelectron yield. It is found that the photoelectron current as a\nfunction of dipole field is attenuated by a factor of 30 to 50 reaching a saturation value at 0.4 T.\nThe experiments performed at grazing incidence in a dipole field demonstrate that the electrons\nare constrained to move along the field lines, resulting in electrons emitted from strip 1 and strip 3 to\nreturn to the same strip from which they were created. In the case of the LHC these electrons interact\nweakly with the proton beam, gaining insufficient energy to cause multipacting or contribute a\nsignificant heat load [9]. On the other hand, photoelectrons from strips 2 and 4 (top and bottom) are\nnot attenuated by the presence of the dipole field and thus they interact with the proton beam and\ncontribute to the electron cloud.\nThe results presented here are important input to predict the behaviour of the electron cloud in the\ndipole fields of the LHC and to estimate electron stimulated gas desorption. The forward scattered\nreflectivity, as measured by the deposited power and by the photon flux, show significantly different\nresults for the smooth surface and for the saw\u2013tooth surface. With respect to the electron-cloud effect\nin the LHC a low reflectivity is desirable since it will limit the photoelectron production to the region\nof the primary impact of the photons in the equitorial plane where electrons are efficiently attenuated\nby the strong vertical dipole field [10]. From this point of view, the saw\u2013tooth surface is attractive for\nthe beam screen of the LHC.\nReferences\n                                               \n[1] Gr\u00f6bner, O., CERN LHC Project Report 127 (1997).\n[2] Zimmermann, F., CERN LHC Project Report 95 (1997).\n[3] Br\u00fcning, O.S., CERN LHC Project Report 158 (1997), Br\u00fcning, O.S.,  CERN LHC Project Report\n190 (1997).\n[4] Furman, M.A.,  CERN LHC Project Report 180 (1997).\n[5] Baglin, V., Collins, I.R. and Gr\u00f6bner, O., CERN LHC Project Report 206 (1998).\n[6] Anashin, V.V., Malyshev, O.B., Fedorov, N.V., Nazmov, V.P., Goldenberg, B.G., Collins, I.R. \nand Gr\u00f6bner, O., CERN LHC Project Report 266 (1999).\n[7] Anashin, V.V., Dostovalov, R.V., Malyshev, O.B., Krasnov, A.A. and Pyata, E.E., CERN Vacuum\nTechnical Note 99-03 (1999).\n[8] Anashin, V.V., Malyshev, O.B., Fedorov, N.V.  and Krasnov, A.A., CERN Vacuum Technical\nNote 99\u201306 (1999).\n[9] Baglin, V., Collins, I.R., G\u00f3mez\u2013Go\u00f1i, J., Gr\u00f6bner, O., Henrist, B., Hilleret, N., Laurent, J-M.,\n Pivi, M., Cimino, R., Anashin, V.V., Dostovalov, R.V., Fedorov, N.V., Malyshev, O.B., Krasnov,\nA.A. and Pyata, E.E., presented at e+e\u2013 Factories\u201999, KEK in Tsukuba, Japan 21st \u201324th Sept. 1999.\n[10] Baglin, V., Bruning, O., Calder, R., Caspers, F., Collins, I.R., Gr\u00f6bner, O., Hilleret, N., Laurent,\nJ-M., Morvillo, M., Pivi, M. and Ruggiero, F., EPAC-98, June 1998.\n"}
