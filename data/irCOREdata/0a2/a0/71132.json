The shape of the electron energy distribution\nhas long been a central question in the field of high-\nfrequency radio-induced optical emission experiments. This\nreport presents estimates of the electron energy distribution\nfunction, fe(E), from 0 to 60 eV, based on optical multi-\nwavelength (6300, 5577, 8446, 4278 A\u02da) data and 930-MHz\nincoherent scatter radar measurements of ion temperature,\nelectron temperature and electron concentration. According\nto our estimate, the electron energy distribution has a depres-\nsion at around 2 eV, probably caused by electron excitation of\nvibrational states in N2, and a high energy tail that is clearly\nsupra-thermal. The temporal evolution of the emissions in-\ndicates that the electron temperature still plays an important\nrole in providing electrons with energies close to 2 eV. At the\nhigher energies the electron energy distribution has a non-\nthermal tail.\nKeywords.

Even so, little is known about\nCorrespondence to: B. Gustavsson\n(bjorn.gustavsson@nipr.ac.jp)\nthe mechanism by which energy from the HF radio wave\nis transferred to the excitations of the atoms, molecules and\nions that emit the light. One major step to clarify this issue\nis to determine the shape of the electron energy distribution\nfunction fe(E) during HF-pumping. In this report, we esti-\nmate the shape of the electron energy distribution using Eu-\nropean Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) UHF measurements of\nelectron concentration, ne, and temperature, Te, and optical\nobservations by the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS)\n(Steen et al., 1997; Bra\u00a8ndstro\u00a8m, 2003) and Digital All-Sky\nImager (DASI) (Kosch et al., 1998) of enhanced emissions at\n4278, 5577, 6300 and 8446 A\u02da.\nWhen a powerful HF radio wave is transmitted into the\nionosphere with a frequency less than the peak ionospheric\nplasma frequency, this wave deposits most of its energy into\nthe plasma in a narrow region. This region ranges from the\nreflection altitude, where the pump frequency equals the lo-\ncal plasma frequency, fP , down to the altitude of upper hy-\nbrid resonance, where the pump frequency, f0, equals the lo-\ncal upper hybrid frequency fUH=(f 2\u03b3+f 2P )1\/2), and at times\nseveral kilometers below. This process is intricate, primar-\nily for the following three reasons: the energy of the pump\nwave is much less than the thermal energy of the electrons;\nthe plasma is weakly ionized; and there are several possible\nnonlinear physical processes that can contribute. Moreover,\nthese processes might contribute in different proportions de-\npending on whether f0 is above, below or within a few kHz\nof a multiple of the electron gyro resonance (f0\u2248nf\u03b3 ) at the\naltitude where f0=fUH .\n1748 B.

EISCAT UHF observations of the electron concentration\n(top panel) and electron temperature (bottom panel). As seen in the\ntop panel the electron concentration in the F region decays steadily,\nand there are no signs of significant precipitation until 19:30 UT.\nThe electron temperature reaches 3000\u20133500 K for each pulse. For\nthe first pulses the hot (Te>2500K) region is approximately 50 km\nin altitude extent but gradually the heated region extends to more\nthan 100 km. The dashed black line is the approximate upper hy-\nbrid level, the solid black line is the altitude of the maximum tem-\nperature enhancements and the white line is the altitude where an\nMSIS model atmosphere gives the same O(1D) effective lifetime,\nas estimated from the DASI 6300 A\u02da observations.\nEarly observations of high ratios between enhancements in\n5577 and 6300 A\u02da presented by Haslett and Megill (1974) and\nBernhardt et al. (1989b) have been taken as an indication that\nthe electron distribution causing the enhanced emissions has\na significant accelerated part (e.g. Bernhardt et al., 1989b;\nGurevich et al., 1985). Some experimental indications of ac-\ncelerated electrons from Arecibo (IS-radar) have been pre-\nsented (Carlson et al., 1982; Gurevich et al., 2000). This has\nbeen explained with electron acceleration by Langmuir tur-\nbulence (LT) excited at the reflection altitude. Specifically,\nweak LT has been dealt with theoretically by, for example,\nPerkins and Kaw (1971), Weinstock (1975), and Weinstock\nand Bezzerides (1974), and strong LT by DuBois et al. (1990)\nand Gurevich et al. (1985). Numerical simulations for iono-\nspheric conditions have yielded power-law like tails of the\nelectron distribution (Wang et al., 1997). Others (primarily\nMantas, 1994; Mantas and Carlson, 1996) argued that the en-\nhancements in 6300 A\u02da could well be explained by excitation\nof the high energy tail of the heated electron distribution and\nthat the early observations of enhancements in 5577 A\u02da were\nscarce and unreliably close to the instrumental noise level.\nWith improved optical instrumentation, recent observa-\ntions (e.g. Gustavsson et al., 2003) show that the enhance-\nments at 5577 A\u02da regularly reach 10\u201330% of the 6300 A\u02da en-\nhancements. This reinforces the view that a significant part\nof the enhanced emissions are caused by non-thermal elec-\ntrons. Further, optical and incoherent scatter radar observa-\ntions coupled with thermosphere-ionosphere modeling have\nshown that the thermal model overestimates the 6300 A\u02da en-\nhancements (Sergienko et al., 2000; Gustavsson et al., 2001).\nThis decrease in excitation of the O(1D) state can be ex-\nplained by a depletion in the electron energy distribution\nfrom 2 to some 6 eV caused by the interaction of the elec-\ntrons with the much more abundant neutrals (typical ion-\nto-neutral ratios in these nighttime experiments range from\n10\u22124 to 10\u22129) in the F region (Mishin et al., 2000; Gustavs-\nson et al., 2004). However, this effect cannot explain the\nlarge 5577 to 6300 ratio.\nOther observations show a minimum in the enhancements\nin 6300 A\u02da (Kosch et al., 2002; Bernhardt et al., 2000) when\nf0 is at an electron gyro resonance at the altitude where\nf0=fUH . During these conditions, UH and electron Bern-\nstein phenomena are suppressed, as are anomalous absorp-\ntion and electron heating. This allows more of the pump\nwave energy to propagate to the pump reflection altitude. De-\nspite the larger amount of energy available to excite LT, no\nsignificant enhancements at 6300 A\u02da are produced. This in-\ndicates that LT alone is not the dominant cause of enhanced\noptical emissions.\n2 Experiment and data\nFrom 18:00 to 19:36 UT on 10 March 2002, the EISCAT\nHeating Facility (Rietveld et al., 1993) in Troms\u00f8 (69.6\u25e6 N,\n19.2\u25e6 E) was operated at 5.423 MHz, transmitting\u223c375 MW\neffective radiated power in ordinary mode with a 4 min on\nand 2 min off cycle to enhance airglow in the nighttime F re-\ngion ionosphere. The antenna beam was approximately 6.8\u25e6\nwide and directed 11.8\u25e6 south of zenith. During the entire\nexperiment the EISCAT UHF incoherent scatter radar mea-\nsured electron temperature (Te) enhancements up to 3000\u2013\n3500 K, while the F region electron density decayed, as\nshown in Fig. 1. The temperatures seen agree well with pre-\nvious observations (Gustavsson et al., 2001; Rietveld et al.,\n2003; Leyser et al., 2000), even though the effective radiated\npower here is approximately 2 times greater. Two factors\nthat contribute to limiting the temperature are that the en-\nergy transfer from the electrons increases exponentially with\ntemperature, and that the HF pump deposits its energy where\nthe electron density is 1.7 times higher when transmitting at\n5.423 MHz compared to 4.04 MHz .\nDuring this period the Auroral Large Imaging System\n(ALIS) imager temporarily located in Skibotn (69.35\u25e6 N,\n20.36\u25e6 E) made observations in the 6300, 5577, 8446 and\n4278 A\u02da emissions with 7-s exposure every 9\u201311 s, switch-\ning filters between every image. As can be seen in Fig. 2\nthe full-width at half-maximum of the region with enhanced\nemissions is approximately 13\u00b11 km and equal for the 5577\nand 8446 A\u02da lines. Due to diffusion and drift the full-width at\nhalf-maximum for the 6300 A\u02da is slightly larger at 15\u00b12 km.\nFor the 4278 A\u02da emission the size is smaller at 10\u00b14 km but\nit might only appear so because the enhancement is close to\nthe noise level.\nB.

The\nscale on the vertical axis is pixel number, the width of the red-line\nenhancement is approximately 3\u25e6 which corresponds to a 15-km\nwidth at 250 km altitude. The enhancement in 6300 A\u02da is 40\u00b13 R\nfor the first pulses then, with the rise in altitude and widening of\nthe heated electrons, it increases to 55\u201370 R. For the 5577 A\u02da the en-\nhancement for the first two pulses are 10\u201315 R and then it varies\naround 10 R. For 8446 A\u02da the enhancement increases from 10\u00b12 to\n15\u00b13 R and for the 4278 A\u02da N+2 (1NG)) emission the enhancements\nare indistinguishable from the noise for the first pulses but they grow\nup to 5 R at 18:42 UT.\nSimultaneously, the co-located digital all-sky imager\n(DASI) made observations in the 6300 A\u02da emission from\nO(1D) from 18:00 to 18:30 UT, from 18:50 to 19:06 UT and\nfrom 19:26 to 19:34 UT; and in the 5577 A\u02da emission from\nO(1S) from 18:33 to 18:47 UT and from 19:09 to 19:23 UT,\nall with 10 s exposure and 1 image every 10-s. As can be\nseen in Fig. 3 the intensity grows from around 10 R for the\nfirst pulse to 60\u201370 R for the pulses after 18:48 UT. From the\ninitial decay of the 6300 A\u02da emission, we estimate the O(1D)\neffective lifetime \u03c4O(1D) to be 26\u201333 s, using the method sug-\ngested by Bernhardt et al. (2000).

For I5577 there are two main\nsources of O(1S). The most important in the F region is di-\nrect electron excitation:\nO + e\u2212 \u2192 O(1S)+ e\u2212, (1)\nwhich has an excitation threshold of 4.17 eV and a cross\nsection as depicted in Fig. 4. The second is energy transfer\nfrom N2(A36+u )\nN2(A\n36+u )+O \u2192 N2 +O(1S), (2)\nwhich does not give a significant contribution in the F region\nwhere the concentration of N2 is much lower than O.\nFor I6300 the major sources from energetic electrons to\nO(1D) are direct electron excitation\nO + e\u2212 \u2192 O(1D)+ e\u2212, (3)\nwith an excitation threshold of 1.96 eV and about a 10 times\nhigher cross section than that for O(1S) and cascading from\nO(1S)\nO(1S)\u2192 O(1D)+ h\u03bd\n\u03bb=5577A\u02da.

For electron excitation of (N2) we have the emission cross\nsection for 4278 A\u02da from (N+2 ) with threshold for ionization + ex-\ncitation at 18 eV and excitation cross section for N+2 (A36\n+\nu ) and\nN2(C\n35u) \u2212 all with experimental data from Itikawa et al. (1986).\nIn the quiet F-region ionosphere the major source of\nO(1D) is excitation from dissociative recombination of O+2 .\nO+2 + e\u2212 \u2192 O(1D)+O (5)\nwith a yield, Q, of 1.2. For situations with rapid variations\nthis has to be included since its rate varies with Te\nk = 1.9\u22127(300\/Te)0.5. (6)\nHowever, at steady state, which we considers here, the loss\nof O+2 is balanced by the source-charge transfer from O+ to\nO2\nO+ +O2 \u2192 O +O+2 (7)\nThus, we obtain an O(1D) excitation rate that is independent\nof Te\nrO(\n1D)=nO+2 nekQ=nO+2 nek=nO+nO2K\n(nO+nO2K\/nek)nekQ=nO+nO2KQ. (8)\nAccording to Chen et al. (1978) the rate coefficient (K) for\ncharge transfer from O+ is to O2\nK=3.33\u00d710\u221212 exp(3.72(300.\/Tf )\u22121.78(300.\/Tf )2). (9)\nwhere Tf is the average of the neutral and ion tempera-\ntures. At the end of the 4 min HF pump periods the modi-\nfied O(1D) excitation rates from dissociative recombination\nis within a few percent of the natural background rates.\nThere are two sources for I8446: electron excitation of\natomic oxygen and dissociative excitation of molecular oxy-\ngen. Since the concentration of molecular oxygen is approx-\nimately 5% of the atomic oxygen at the region of interest\nand the emission cross section for dissociative excitation is\na factor of 5 smaller, we only include direct excitation of\natomic oxygen. Finally, the only source of I4278 is electron\nimpact ionization to the N+2 (B26\u2212u ) state, for which we use\nthe emission cross section from Itikawa et al. (1986). How-\never, about half the intensity of the 1\u20135N22P band at 4268 A\u02da\npasses through the passband of the filter. Thus, we have to\ntake that into account. For the N2(C35u) we obtain the ex-\ncitation cross section from Itikawa et al. (1986) and use Ein-\nstein coefficients and Franck-Condon factors from Gilmore\net al. (1992).\nIn order to obtain a simple set of equations for fe(E) we\nnote that the region of enhanced emission is small, with a\ntypical size of about 30 km (Gustavsson et al., 2001), and\nassume that all excitation occurs in a 10-km wide region with\nconditions for the HF-pump wave reflection altitude. This\ngives us the following set of integral equations for the column\nemission rates:\nI5577=10\u22126 A5577\u2211\nAO(1S)\nnO1z\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nve(E)\u03c32(E)fe(E)dE, (10)\nI6300=10\u22126A6300\u03c4 IDO (I5577+nO1z]\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nve(E)\u03c31(E)fe(E)dE), (11)\nI8446 = 10\u22126nO1z\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nve(E)\u03c33(E)fe(E)dE, (12)\nI4278 = 10\u22126nN21z\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nve(E)\u03c34(E)fe(E)dE, (13)\nI4268 = 10\u22126nN2Q1z\n\u221e\u222b\n0\nve(E)\u03c35(E)fe(E)dE.

By separating the number\nof electrons in the tail (by using n1 and n2 for the electrons\nwith E>2 eV and n0 for the bulk electrons) we can roughly\nmodel the electron \u201cbite-out\u201d at 2 eV. This modification is\ncaused mainly by energy loss to vibrational states of N2, and\nfe(E) is estimated to be depleted to 10\u201320% in the lower\nF region (Mishin et al., 2000). The reason that we require\nthat \u03b3<1\/2 is to avoid \u201cbump-on-tail\u201d populations. That\nHF-pumping cannot produce \u201cbump-on-tail\u201d populations is\na reasonable assumption, considering that the energy of the\npump wave is much less than the thermal energy of the elec-\ntrons. In order to obtain a good fit with the observed emis-\nsions it was not enough to assume a power-law tail, and thus\nwe had to add the accelerated population (n2e\u2212(E\u2212E0)2\/dE2 )\nand the \u201chigher temperature in the tail than the bulk\u201d elec-\ntrons (n1E1\/2e\u2212E\/kBT1). This parameterization should cap-\nture the major features of the modified electron energy distri-\nbution. However, keeping in mind the complexity of electron\nenergy distributions in the auroral ionosphere, we are aware\nthat the real modified electron energy distribution might be\nmore complex.\nThe electron energy distribution is obtained by minimiza-\ntion of the difference between the observed intensities and\nthe intensities predicted by Eqs. (10) to (14). As can be seen\nin Fig. 5 it is possible to obtain a good agreement between\nthe observed data and modeled emission enhancements.\nThe reason that we obtain such a perfect fit for almost all\npulses is that there are six degrees of freedom in the parame-\n1800 1810 1820 1830 1840 1850 1900 1910 1920\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nObserved and modeled emission enhancements\nTime (UT)\nCo\nlu\nm\nn \nem\niss\nio\nn \nra\nte\n (R\n)\n6300 \u00c5\n5577 \u00c5\n8446 \u00c5\n4278 \u00c5\nFig. 5.

Further, the parameterization is in its struc-\nture very smooth which helps to avoid problems common\nin under-determined problems \u2212 noise sensitivity, and rapid\nfluctuations. To estimate the stability of the solution we also\nstart the optimization at a large number of points in the pa-\nrameter space, and it appears that the numerical optimization\ngives approximately the same results for most of the starting\npoints.\n3.1 Interpretation of fitted parameters\nThe typical shape of the estimated electron energy distribu-\ntion from 2 to 100 eV has a thermal-like part from 2 eV up to\nsome 10\u201320 eV, then a small but significant accelerated tail\nwith an acceleration energy of between 40 and 60 eV and a\nsharp cutoff at higher energies, as shown in Fig. 6. Here it\nshould be noted that even though the electron distribution has\na positive slope tail, the electron distribution function is flat.\nAt energies from 2 eV to 12\u201330 eV all but one electron en-\nergy distribution (19:00\u201319:04 UT) have thermal-like com-\nponents with temperatures ranging from 12 000 to 47 000 K.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 7 this temperature is much larger\nthan the bulk temperature measured by EISCAT UHF. How-\never, the fraction of electrons in this super-hot tail is very\nsmall, which is accentuated by the depletion in fe(E) at 2 eV,\ncaused mainly by excitation of the vibrational states in N2.\n1752 B.

For the later period\nthe depletion is again larger by 30 to 50%.\nThe parameter \u03b3 is approximately 1\/2 for all but four\nHF pump pulses.

Gustavsson et al.: Electron energy distribution during HF pumping 1753\ntemperature enhancements of up to 3500 K. Further, we have\ndeveloped a method to estimate the shape of the electron en-\nergy distribution function in the energy range from 1.96 to\n100 eV. The resulting estimates of the electron energy dis-\ntribution show that there is an accelerated component with\nenergies from 15\u201322 eV to 45\u201365 eV where the electron dis-\ntribution is essentially flat. At intermediate energies be-\nlow 15 eV and above 1.96 the electron energy distribution\nis most often thermal-like with temperatures between 9000\nand 43 000 K. At 2 eV there seems to be a depletion of be-\ntween 10 and 90% in the electron energy distribution. Gure-\nvich and Milikh (1997) and Bernhardt et al. (1989b) have\nsuggested that the super-heated component in the electron\nenergy distribution explains the high ratio between enhance-\nments in 5577 and 6300 A\u02da, which is in agreement with the\nobservations presented in Gustavsson et al. (2003). Mishin\net al. (2000) have predicted the depletion at 2 eV to be of the\nmagnitude observed here during F-region HF-pump experi-\nments. But in order to explain the observed enhancements in\n8446 and 4278 A\u02da that we present here, there has to be a com-\nponent of electron distribution accelerated to higher energies\nthan that previously expected.\nAcknowledgements.
