The paper uses data derived from a commercially motivated survey (n = 1513) to \nexplore domestic consumption behaviours most closely associated with the issue of \ndisruptive climate change.

Over-consumption, resource use and \nthe generation of pollution and waste are degrading environmental systems and the \n\u201eecosystem services\u201f they provide and which people depend upon, directly and indirectly, \nfor their survival and wellbeing (WRI, 2005). In the case of the most pressing \nenvironmental challenge, preventing and\/or responding to disruptive climate change, it \nhas significant implications for the global economy. The evidence review by the eminent \neconomist Sir Nicholas Stern (2006) forecast that unless 1% of GDP is invested in \nresponding to the climate challenge (later increased to 2% to reflect continuing inaction), \nthen the negative consequences could shrink the global economy by 20% by 2035. The \nneed to move to a lower carbon economy is therefore a pressing strategic challenge \nwidely acknowledged by both policy makers and businesses.  \n \nMoving towards a lower carbon economy requires a range of possible levers to be \nemployed including technological innovation, regulation, investment, financial \nincentives, organisational change and education. Carbon emissions are also strongly \nlinked to the consumption of private households and the choices and behaviours of \nindividuals. Motivating consumers to adopt more sustainable consumption behaviours is \ntherefore an important policy goal and a source of potential commercial marketing \nopportunities. It has therefore become a focus for academic research, much of which was \ncomprehensively synthesized by Tim Jackson (2005) in his research monograph \n\u201eMotivating Sustainable Consumption\u201f.  Jackson\u201fs synthesis, together with other studies \n  \n2 \n \n(e.g. Moisander, 2007), demonstrate that consumer behaviour is a complex and \nmultidimensional phenomenon, which is further complicated by the inclusion of \nsustainability concerns. They also highlight the range of factors thought to influence \nconsumers\u201f sustainability-related behaviours including their demographics, values, \nattitudes, knowledge, goals, emotions and circumstances. Behaviour can also vary \naccording to the nature of the purchase, including its social significance and the \nsituational influences of the time and place of purchase.  \n \nThere is a myriad of potential influences on consumer behaviour in relation to \nsustainability which researchers have tried to identify and measure. Many of these, such \nas goals, attitudes, social identity, perceived self-efficacy and situational forces are \nincorporated within conventional integrative models of consumer behaviour (such as \nBagozzi\u201fs et al\u201fs 2002 \u201cComprehensive Model of Consumer Action\u201d) and have also been \nwell-researched in conventional, as well as sustainable, consumption contexts. Other \npotential influences are more characteristic of models of behaviour developed specifically \nto explain environmentally and socially motivated behaviours. Grob\u201fs (1995) Model of \nEnvironmental Behavior for example found that environmental knowledge together with \npersonal values, perceived control and emotional response determined environmental \nbehaviour. Some influences are features of models developed by extending existing \nmodels of consumer behaviour, with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) being a \nparticularly popular basis. For example, Oom Do Valle et al. (2005) extended the TPB \nwith elements from other models of altruistic behaviour, environmental behaviour and \nenvironmental concern to create a comprehensive model of recycling behaviour. This \n  \n3 \n \nincluded very behaviour-specific influencing factors such as knowledge about recycling, \nand perceived convenience of local recycling systems.   \n \nIt is unusual to find a potential behavioural influence which is relatively generic \n(ie. not specific to a particular environmental behaviour such as recycling), yet appears \nonly in those models of consumer behaviour developed to explain social or \nenvironmental consumption behaviour. One such factor, is a sense of \u201eresponsibility\u201f and \nhow it is perceived and ascribed by consumers. This is a key feature of  Stern et al.\u201fs \n1999, Value Belief Norm Model, but has otherwise been generally neglected by \nresearchers interested in pro-environmental consumer behaviour. This paper seeks to \nfurther our understanding of how consumer perceptions about responsibilities may \ninfluence their behaviour in the context of climate change. It explores this issue with \nregard to those domestic consumption behaviours most closely associated with the issue \nof disruptive climate change. \n \n  \n4 \n \nProfiling Consumers for Sustainability \nSustainability orientated consumer research encompasses a variety of concepts of \nmore sustainable consumption using a range of labels for consumers and their behaviour \n(including green, greener, sustainable, pro-environmental, pro-social, environmentally \nconscious, altruistic, ecological, ethical or alternative, see Jackson, 2005). The key \nstreams of this research involve profiling consumers in relation to sustainability concerns \nto enable markets to be meaningfully segmented (Straughan and Roberts, 1999); profiling \ntypes of consumer to understand how they might be motivated to consume more \nsustainably (Jackson, 2005);  testing the acceptability of price premiums for more \nsustainable products (Laroche et al., 2001);  and exploring why there is frequently a \nsignificant gap between consumers\u201f reported willingness to consume more sustainably, \nand actual behaviour (Vermeir and Verbeke, 2006).  \nOne contentious issue affecting early attempts at profiling consumers and \nsegmenting markets for sustainability were that they were often largely based on socio-\ndemographic variables (Straughan and Roberts, 1999). However as Schlegelmilch et al. \n(1996) note, this reflected the ease with which such variables could be applied and \nmeasured rather than any very strong theoretical or conceptual arguments. As the body of \nresearch expanded, the value of using socio-demographic variables became increasingly \ncontentious, particularly given the tendency for different studies to produce inconclusive \nand contradictory results for particular demographic variables (Kilbourne and Beckman, \n1986; Robinson and Smith, 2002). Diamantopoulos et al. (2003) provide a critical review \nof the literature linking socio-demographics to environmentally-orientated consumer \nattitudes and behaviours. They conclude that socio-demographics alone are of limited \n  \n5 \n \nvalue for profiling, but are more potentially useful when used in combination with other \ninfluences such as values, attitudes or knowledge. This study builds on this insight by \ntesting the value of socio-demographic variables when used with other socio-\npsychological variables, in this case, the under-researched notion of consumer \nresponsibility in relation to the environment and climate change.  \nResearch profiling consumers and segmenting them in terms of sustainable \nconsumer behaviour also has another acknowledged weakness, which is a tendency to \nfocus on individual behaviours (such as recycling or purchasing of a particular type of \nproduct) and on specific impacts such as energy usage (Spangenberg and Lorek, 2002). \nThis is problematic because the research literature indicates that while some types of \nsustainable behaviour are influenced by factors such as values, others are not. Even \namongst those behaviours influenced by values, particular values influence different \nbehaviours in different ways (Pepper et al. 2009; Barr, 2007; Corraliza and Berenguer, \n2000). \nAnother problem with the over-emphasis on individual behaviours and impacts is \nthat it is the cumulative impact of all a consumer\u201fs behaviour that is significant. This is \ndemonstrated by the \u201erebound effect\u201f associated with behaviours such as energy saving. \nReducing domestic energy use apparently lessens a consumer\u201fs environmental impact, \nbut if the resulting financial savings are spent on energy intensive goods and services, \nthis may not be the case (Herring, 1999). This paper seeks to gain insight into overall \nconsumer lifestyles and their sustainability by considering a range of behaviours and by \nseeking to evaluate their net effect in relation to climate change. \n \n  \n6 \n \nEvolving Notions of Consumer Responsibility \nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has received considerable attention \nacademically (recent examples include Peng 2009 and Jenkins 2009) and in the wider \nmedia. Other notions of business responsibility, and particularly an equivalent concept of \n\u201econsumer social responsibility\u2019, have received comparatively little attention (Brinkman \nand Peattie, 2008). This may be due to the dominance of the notion of consumer \nsovereignty, which assigns power as opposed to responsibility to consumers, as a key \nprinciple underpinning the marketing discipline.  \n \nWhen the existing marketing literature does consider the social responsibility of \nconsumers, it has mostly restricted itself to questions of the behaviour of the consumer \nrather than the company, and of consumer dishonesty rather than on more positive \nbehaviours (Brinkman and Peattie, 2008). However, there is an emerging normative \nconcept of the \u201ecitizen consumer\u201f which Gabriel and Lang (1995: 175) define as \u201ea \nresponsible consumer, a socially-aware consumer, a consumer who thinks ahead and \ntempers his or her desires by social awareness, a consumer whose actions must be \nmorally defensible and who must occasionally be prepared to sacrifice...\u201f. In marketing, \nsuch a concept of consumer responsibility is still under-developed, but looking across \nother disciplines of social science scholarship such as health, notions of personal \nresponsibility tend to be more prevalent (see for example, Attell-Thompson, 2005 and \nBricas 2008).  \n \n  \n7 \n \nAlthough such a sense of personal responsibility might be expressed by \nconsumers through self-sacrifice, potentially more significant would be a sense of \npersonal responsibility as an individual being extended to a sense of responsibility as a \nconsumer for the behaviour of the companies they patronise. Williams (2005) discusses \nthe role consumers could play, suggesting an increasing role for consumer social \nresponsibility to complement CSR. Reporting results from the \u201eWhich? Bite Back\u201f \nsurvey, Williams suggests that, since 66% of consumers believe they can influence a \ncompany\u201fs environmental and ethical behaviour, they might therefore be prepared to \naccept some responsibility for how companies behave. He urges the development of a \nproactive notion of consumer social responsibility that encourages more socially and \nenvironmentally favourable behaviour by companies. The link between consumer power \nand responsibility is also raised by Peters (2005) reporting on the practices of the Dutch \nConsumer Association, which support the notion that consumers can affect, and therefore \nbear some responsibility for, the practices and policies of companies.  There have also \nbeen some empirical studies linking consumer behaviour as \u201evoting behaviour\u201f to \nperceptions of consumer responsibility (see for example Dickinson & Carsky, 2005).  \n \nEven where the consumer is potentially willing to adopt this type of responsibility \nand seek to influence companies, their ability to do so will depend upon the availability \nof relevant information (Williams, 2005; Barnett et al. 2005). This could include \ninformation relating to companies\u201f practices and policies (Peters 2005) and to the \nconsequences of consumers\u201f choices. However information alone will not guarantee that \nconsumers respond. Too much information can create a sense of \u201einformation overload\u201f \n  \n8 \n \nwhich deters a response (Jacoby 1984, Hahn, Lawson and Lee 1992). Consumer response \nalso depends on their ability to understand the information, but as Shaw and Clarke \n(1999) note, individuals are often confused about environmental issues and are \ninconsistent in  making connections between an issue like climate change and aspects of \ntheir own lifestyles and consumption (Anable et al., 2006). Ability to act on relevant \ninformation will also depend on the consumer\u201fs sense of perceived behavioural control \n(Giles and Cairns 1995, Armitage and Conner 2001) and their wider sense of self-\nefficacy (Terry and O\u201fLeary 1995). \nIn relation to sustainability issues (including climate change) and responsibility, \nthe research emphasis has often been on who is responsible for particular problems, or \nwho should bear responsibility for addressing them. Rodrigues et al. (2005) and Lenzen \net al. (2007) use ecological economics to frame responsibility in terms of ascribing who \nis accountable for a) environmental pressure and b) the environmental impacts of \nproducers or consumers respectively. Similarly Munksgaard and Pedersen (2001) sought \nto ascribe responsibility for CO2 emissions from a policy perspective. From a marketing \nperspective, what is more significant is the consumer\u201fs sense of responsibility, and how \nthey perceive and ascribe responsibilities for the environmental consequences of \nproducts, production impacts, purchase behaviour, and consumption and disposal \nbehaviours. For companies and policy makers seeking to develop more sustainable \nsystems of consumption and production, the role that consumers\u201f sense of responsibility \nplays in their willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) is potentially \nvital and needs to be researched and understood. \n \n  \n9 \n \nAwareness of the potential importance of consumer responsibility appears to be \ngrowing. Kaiser and Schimoda (1999: 244) in discussing the psychology of PEBs stress \nthe need to develop personal responsibility stating that \u201cIf a person is aware of the \nconsequences of certain behaviour, the ascription of personal responsibility becomes \ncrucial.\u201d This was reflected in the recent EU campaign \u201eYou Control Climate Change\u20191, \nin which consumers are urged to take responsibility by turning down the thermostats in \ntheir homes, switching off their appliances, recycling and walking.  Similarly the research \nwhich underpinned the UK Sustainable Development Commission\u201fs \u201eI Will If You Will\u201f \nreport (Sustainable Consumption Roundtable 2006) highlighted the importance of a sense \nof shared responsibility.   \n \nDespite the growing emphasis on consumer responsibility, it remains under-\nresearched (Carrigan and Attalla 2001), and is mostly discussed normatively and \ntheoretically (for example Caruana and Crane 2008). Relatively little empirical work has \nbuilt on these ideas, and that which does exist explores the idea with a relatively narrow \nfocus  (see for example Wray-Lake et al., 2010 which only explores adolescent \nbehaviour). There is an irony that \u201cenvironmentally responsible\u201d is one of the more \ncommonly used labels for more sustainable consumer behaviour, when consumer \nenvironmental responsibility remains a comparatively under-researched and poorly \nunderstood concept.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1\n http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/climat\/campaign\/index.htm \n  \n10 \n \nUnderstanding Consumer Socio-Environmental Responsibility  \nThere are several problems with the existing literature when seeking to \nunderstand the motivations behind PEB, and the role played by consumers\u201f sense of, and \nascription of, responsibility. Firstly, there is what Jackson (2005) describes as a \u201ewell-\ninformed confusion\u201f in the academic literature resulting from the differing definitions and \nterminology used (often interchangeably), especially the wide range of titles applied to \nsustainability-orientated consumption behaviours (as noted above) and the varying terms \ndescribing different types of responsibility. For simplicity this article will use PEB to \ndescribe pro-environmental behaviours in the context of climate change, since most of \nthe major PEBs such as recycling, energy-saving, travel and purchase reduction are also \nspecifically pro-climate.   \n \nSecondly, much of the early work uses a very narrow conception of social \nresponsibility. Webster\u201fs (1975) early extensive exploration of the \u201esocially conscious \nconsumer\u201f used as the dependent variable a measure of social responsibility, based on a \nscale developed by Berkowitz and Lutterman (1968) and refined by Anderson and \nCunningham (1972). Even Webster concedes that this scale \u201edefines social responsibility \nin a rather specific (and perhaps outdated) way\u201f by basing it on the acceptance of norms, \ninvolvement in community affairs and identification with the protestant work ethic. It is \nperhaps unsurprising that he found no relationship between a sense of social \nresponsibility using that measure and socially conscious consumer behaviour.   \n \n  \n11 \n \nA third weakness in the literature is a tendency to consider \u201esocial responsibility\u201f \nas a broad construct, and to assume that concepts like social responsibility, environmental \nresponsibility and altruism are interrelated and can be used interchangeably. Tucker et al. \n(1986) sought to break down the differences between general social responsibility (also \ncommenting on work by Berkowitz, this time Berkowtiz and Daniels, 1963) and specific \nindividual responsibility. They suggested that individual environmental responsibility \nwas a subset of social responsibility, and that the term individual social responsibility can \nbe used interchangeably with altruism or pro-social behaviour (although work on specific \nenvironmental altruism appears to be lacking in the literature).  As with other authors, \nTucker et al. attempt to understand the characteristics, whether psychological, attitudinal \nor socio-demographic of what they term \u201eenvironmentally responsible consumer citizens\u201f \nbut do not then go on to discuss how specifically this may affect their behaviour and \nconsumption choices.   \n \nThe literature on ethical consumption encompasses issues beyond the \nenvironment including oppressive regimes, human rights, factory farming and political \ndonations (Harrison, Newholm and Shaw 2005). Broad measures of social responsibility \nor ethical consumption may be unhelpful for understanding consumer behaviour in \nrelation to more specific environmental issues.  A political activist with strong views on \nhuman rights or political donations, and an environmental activist with strong views on \nfactory farming might have little interest in each other\u201fs agendas or priorities. In some \ncases these might even conflict. Ever since Kinnear et al. (1974) sought to identify the \n\u201eecologically concerned consumer\u201f by simply extending Anderson and Cunningham\u201fs \n  \n12 \n \n(1972) \u201eSocial Responsibility Scale\u201f, the working assumption within marketing \nscholarship has been that the socially and environmentally concerned consumer will be \nmuch the same thing. However, this is a significant assumption, and a misanthropic \nanimal lover would be a simple confounding example. Similarly the research on how \nenvironmental concerns impact on consumer behaviour have overused broad measures of \nenvironmental concern (Follows & Jobber, 2000), whereas more specific environmental \nissues (such as animal cruelty or concerns about genetic modification) are more strongly \ncorrelated with actual behaviour (Fraj and Martinez, 2007).  \n \nA fourth weakness is the tendency for research to focus on consumer perceptions \nof their personal responsibility in relation to an issue, without attempting to understand \nthe perceived allocation of responsibility to others.  For example if consumers feel that \nothers such as governments or businesses are more responsible than themselves for \ncausing climate change, how would this affect their own behaviour and attitudes? Zacca\u00ef \n(2006) observed that the attitude-behaviour gap often noted amongst consumers with \nstrong pro-environmental attitudes was linked to uncertainty about consumer \neffectiveness combined with an expectation that government should tackle sustainability \nissues through regulation. There is little research attempting to apply a broader, multi-\nstakeholder perspective to responsibility, although Rodrigues and Domingos (2008) did \nseek to apply mathematical modelling to determine how much responsibility should be \nplaced on the company (the producer), the consumer (households, capital purchasers etc)  \nand intermediaries in an attempt to monitor and resolve environmental problems. \nSimilarly Wray-Lake et al. (2010), examine the ascription of responsibility amongst \n  \n13 \n \nadolescents between individuals, consumers and government in environmental \nbehaviours including consumption. They found a declining sense of responsibility \namongst adolescents over time, and a tendency to ascribe responsibility to government or \nan abstract notion of \u201econsumers\u201f rather than to themselves. \n \nPerhaps because of these difficulties, research focussing on the links between \nconsumer responsibility and PEB, and which takes the ideas of consumer responsibility \nbeyond a normative and theoretical discussion, remains a rarity.  Kaiser and Schimoda \n(1999) did look specifically at the link between responsibility and what they term \necological behaviour.  They broke down the responsibility concept suggesting two \nspecific responsibility feelings, feeling morally (related to causality, freedom of choice \nand intentionality) or conventionally (related to desire for approval and fear of \natonement) responsible for the environment.  They found that moral responsibility is \nmore closely linked to PEB, especially in terms of causality (that is how much a person \nfeels they cause the problem).  Overall they suggest that 55% of a person\u201fs PEB can be \nexplained by what they term, a responsibility judgement.  \n \nWithin the \u201eMotivational, Moral and Value Theories\u201f school of research into pro-\nenvironmental behaviours (Vinning and Ebreo, 2002), responsibility as a concept features \nmainly within Norm Activation Theory (Schwartz, 1968 and 1977). This proposes that \npersonal norms which drive behaviour are the result of (1) awareness of consequences \nand (2) feelings of responsibility for carrying out the behaviour.  Since Schwartz\u201fs theory \nis unusual in seeking to explain specifically ethical consumption, it has been widely used \n  \n14 \n \nto understand and to predict PEBs such as  recycling (Hopper and Nielsen 1991; Vining \nand Ebreo 1990 & 1992), household energy saving (Black et al. 1985) or reduced private \ncar use (Bamberg and Schmidt, 2003). Schwartz\u201fs Norm Activation Theory has also been \ndeveloped further into Value Belief Norm (VBN) theory by integrating it with ecological \nvalue theory (Stern et al. 1999, Stern 2000, Hansla et al. 2008). The VBN model (Figure \n1) proposes that behaviour is shaped by consumer values, particularly in relation to their \nacceptance of the need for a \u201enew environmental paradigm\u201f (NEP), their awareness of the \nconsequences of behaviour and their sense of responsibility towards the environment \n(which Stern et al. 1999 articulated as the personal norm of \u201ea sense of obligation to take \npro-environmental actions\u2019 (p.90)).  \nFigure 1: VBN Model \n \nPromisingly, in use this model performed better than competing value-based \nmodels in explaining variances in consumer behaviour. However, the correlations were \nrelatively weak, explaining less than 35% of behavioural variance, and for private sphere \n(i.e. consumption) behaviours, the explained variance was less than 20% (Stern, 2000). \n  \n15 \n \nThe potential practical gap between such values and beliefs and actual behaviour was \nalso demonstrated by Bickman\u201fs (1972) study on littering. In a survey of 500 people\u201fs \nattitudes to littering, 94% of interviewees acknowledged a sense responsibility for dealing \nwith litter, but only 2% of those interviewed were observed to pick up a strategically \nplanted piece of litter as they left the study venue. \n \nOverall there is little consensus about the issue of environmental or climate \nchange responsibility and its effect on behaviour or behavioural intention. This paper \nseeks not to clarify all aspects of responsibility, but to look instead at two specific areas \n(1) the effect of both the consumer taking responsibility for their actions and the \nconsumer placing responsibility on others for their consumption behaviour and (2) \nwhether socio-demographic variables can aid the segmentation and targeting of \nconsumers based on their self-perceived level and type of responsibility, and their self-\nreported PEBs.  In short the issue addressed here is not specifically the concept of \nresponsibility, but whether responsibility matters in terms of behaviour.  Does the \nresponsibility orientation of a consumer, whether or not they feel responsible for (or think \nsomeone else is responsible for) climate change affect their behaviour?  This links \nspecifically into the causality idea of Kaiser and Schimoda (1999). Understanding this \nbetter will help policy makers and businesses to create more effective polices and \npractices that encourage and promote desirable behaviours, especially in terms of \nconsumption.    \nTo summarise, the main research questions were: \n  \n16 \n \n(1) What is the role of demographic variables in consumers\u201f environmentally related \nbehaviours? \n(2) What is the role of demographic variables in consumers\u201f responsibility \norientations (who the consumer feels is responsible for causing and tackling \nclimate change)? \n(3) What role do differing responsibility orientations and agreement with a range of \nattitudinal statements have in environmentally related behaviour? \n \n \nMethodology \nThis research is based upon a partnership project between the Centre for Business \nRelationships, Accountability, Sustainability and Society (BRASS) at Cardiff University \nand the Future Foundation consultancy, exploring issues of climate change, consumer \nbehaviour and the future of brands.  The research involved a range of qualitative and \nquantitative dimensions including questionnaires, interviews, household \u201edeep dives\u201f, and \nDelphi research involving an expert panel.  The issue of responsibility was tackled in the \nqualitative stages (the results of which will not be considered here) which informed the \ndevelopment of the responsibility questions in the questionnaire. The research was \npredominantly funded through a consortium of commercial businesses and public sector \norganisations acting as sponsors.\n2\n  \n                                                 \n2\n The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the ESRC\u201fs Business Engagement Scheme which \nfunded BRASS\u201fs involvement in this research partnership and the secondment of a researcher. \n  \n17 \n \nThe quantitative questionnaire was hosted online utilizing a randomly selected \nnationally representative panel provided by Research Now\n3\n. In the questionnaire alone a \npanel of 1513 consumers were questioned regarding their behaviours, attitudes and \nbeliefs about their consumption behaviour and climate change. Panel members\u201f profiles \nensured that their selection fulfilled sampling criteria, which in this case was for a geo- \nand socio-demographically representative sample which was obtained. Respondents \nreceived a small incentive from Research Now for the completion of questionnaires, and \nthus there was little attrition with the survey.  \n \nThis questionnaire was neither originally designed, nor data the collected, with \nthis specific analysis in mind, which imposes some limitations on the dataset and the \npossible analyses.  The data was also not specifically tailored to either academic research \nor primarily focused on the issue of responsibility. The measures involved would \nprobably have been designed differently had the research been intended for this specific \npurpose.  However, the data generated is rich and the sample is large, so an exploration of \nthe issues can certainly be commenced.  A conservative statistical approach was used for \nthese reasons, and the results should be interpreted as exploratory and tentative.  They do \nhowever suggest the need for deeper, more tailored and further future research into the \narea. \n \n                                                 \n3\n Research Now owns the largest online panel in the UK, comprising of 400,000 consumers. The Research \nNow UK panel is one of the most robust and deeply-profiled panels in the UK with extensively profiled \ninformation on a range of subjects e.g. respondent region, age, social class, household size and status, cars \nowned, mobile phones owned and networks used, bank and financial products used, TV packages in the \nhome, ailments suffered plus much more http:\/\/www.researchnow.co.uk\/Panel_UK.htm (accessed \n18\/11\/08) \n  \n18 \n \nThis paper concentrates on a number of sections of the research questionnaire, \nspecifically those questions relating to consumers\u201f pro- or anti-environmental behaviours, \ntheir feelings about responsibilities for both causing and tackling climate change, along \nwith some general attitudinal statements.  The responsibility questions offered the answer \nchoices of : \u2018me as an individual\u2019, \u2018other individuals\u2019, \u2018extracting industries\u2019, \n\u2018manufacturing companies\u2019, \u2018service industries\u2019, \u2018central government\u2019, \u2018local \ngovernment\u2019, \u2018NGOs\/Not for profit organisations\u2019, \u2018local community groups\u2019, \n\u2018developing countries\u2019, \u2018other\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t know\u2019. Respondents could answer yes or no for \neach of these choices.  A range of attitude statements were also used (which are presented \nand discussed in the results section).  These were answered using 5-point likert scales \nfrom strongly disagree to strongly agree. \n \n The analyses required a measure of behaviour or behavioural intention to act as \ndependent variable and to assess the effects of, or correlations with, different aspects of \nresponsibility.  The questionnaire asked a range of questions regarding consumers\u201f \nbehaviours from reduction, reuse and recycling behaviours to travel, shopping and energy \nconsumption behaviours.  The behaviour measure simply scored them on the number of \nreported PEBs minus any reported anti-environmental\/negative behaviours.  The \nmeasure, termed General Environmental Responsiveness (GER) had a possible minimum \nscore of -47 with a possible maximum score of 79 (a range of 126).  To summarise, those \nscoring at the lower end reported more negative behaviours, those at the upper end more \npositive behaviours. The actual maximum reported for any consumer was 56, the \nminimum was -27 (a range of 83).  There was a mean of 16.3602, median of 16 and mode \n  \n19 \n \nof 9 (although multiple modes did exist).  The standard deviation is 13.68, skewness -\n.028 and kurtosis -.107 showing a relatively normal distribution (GER score, D (1513) = \n0.02, p>.05 was normal).  The GER measure allowed exploration of a range of PEBs and \nnot just at a single behaviour such as recycling \u2013 which often dominates environmental \nbehaviour studies (Vinning and Ebreo 2002).  However in appreciation of this, and to \nallow comparison, four smaller GER scores were developed, each taking parts of the \nmain GER measure, to look at more specific groupings of behaviour.  The four GER \ngroups were Leisure, Purchasing, Household and Travel.  Unlike the main GER measure \nthe GER scores within the smaller groupings were not normally distributed. \n \nThe issue of social desirability of behaviours is important in all environmental \nresearch and it is generally accepted that self reported behaviour does not always \ncorrespond to actual behaviour (Vinning and Ebreo 2002).  It is hoped however that data \ncollection via an impersonal online mechanism, rather than face to face, should \nencourage participants to be honest and open about their behaviour.  Unfortunately due to \nthe secondary nature of the data it was impossible to check actual behaviour to verify the \nbehavioural reports.  It is also suggested that as pro-environmental issues are generally \nsocially approved, that respondents may overestimate their behaviours (Follows and \nJobber, 2000).  Vinning and Ebreo (2002) suggest the need for a \u201ecorrection measure\u201f to \novercome this but this could not be included here again due to the secondary nature of the \ndata.  In designing the GER measure the authors also tried to take into account other \nmethodological challenges in the research area summarised by Vinning and Ebreo \n(2002).  For example they suggest the need to consider how behaviour is assessed and \n  \n20 \n \nsuggest using frequency, duration and intensity as measures as well as whether the \nbehaviour is performed at all.  The data allowed both the actual performance and the level \nof that performance to be taken into account.  For example respondents received extra \npoints if they reported that they recycled \u201eoften\u2019 rather than \u201ea little\u201f.   \n \n A range of exploratory analyses were completed to investigate the data and \nspecifically the effects of responsibility.  Consumers were firstly categorised by their \nanswers to the responsibility questions and the correlations with their GER score.  In \nsome cases a linear regression analysis was also used.  The same analyses were then \ncompleted based on segmentations by age, education, sex, UK region and social class \nalthough not all analyses will be reported here. \n \n A large amount of demographic data was collected within the questionnaire.  Of \nthe 1513 consumers questioned 47.5 % were male, 52.5 % were female.  With regards \nage 32.3 % were between the ages of 16 and 34, 34.6 % were between the ages of 35 and \n54, 13.9 % were between the ages of 55 and 64 and 19.2% were over 65 years of age.   \n \nResults \nInitial demographic analyses exploring the first research question, the role of \ndemographic variables in environmentally responsible behaviours, showed that the \ngeneral GER increased with age from a mean of 14.63 in the age group 16-34 to 19.80 \nfor the 65+ age group (see Table One) and is largely supported across the other GER \ngroupings.  The level of GER also increased as educational level increased (from 15.41 \n  \n21 \n \nfor 5 grade C GCSEs or less to 18.32 for those with a professional qualification) and a \nsimilar pattern is somewhat evident in the other GER groupings. Females also have a \nhigher mean score than men (18.41 compared to 14.09) and this is supported across the \nGER sub groupings.  The female GER mode is also much larger than the male GER \nmode score (25 for women compared to 9 for men).  However GER scores do not show \nany clear pattern by social class or by region.    \n-INSERT TABLE ONE ABOUT HERE- \nIn attempting to answer this first research question it can be seen that there is \nsome demographic influence although this is not always significant or consistent across \ncategorisations.  Table Two contains GER scores for each responsibility orientation \nsegmented by responsibility orientation and by sex and age. \n-INSERT TABLE TWO ABOUT HERE- \n \nAlthough not always significantly different the general trend is that women have \nhigher GER scores than men (supporting the results in Table One).  In terms of age there \nis a strong tendency for higher average GER scores amongst older individuals (again \nsupporting the results in Table One).  Similar explorations were performed for education \nlevel and social class although no discernable pattern was found.  In answering research \nquestion two therefore, as with question one there is some correlation between \ndemographic variables and specific responsibility orientations although these are \nstrongest within age and sex categorisations.  Table Two also contains useful information \nin terms of research question three.  Where consumers ascribe responsibility for causing \nclimate change to someone (including themselves) or something in general their GER \nscores were higher.  In comparison GER scores were lower if the participant ascribed \n  \n22 \n \nresponsibility for tackling climate change to someone or something (including \nthemselves). By comparing the upper and lower sections of Table Two it can be seen, for \nexample, that if a consumer responded that they as an individual felt responsible for \ncausing climate change, they would also see it is their responsibility to tackle climate \nchange.  In fact many more consumers reported that they felt responsible for tackling \nclimate change than for causing it (834 compared to 331 individuals).  This type of \npattern is also prominent for Central Government, Local Government, NGOs\/not for \nprofit organisations and Local community groups where many more consumers reported \nthinking that it was these organisations\u201f responsibility to tackle climate change, than \nthought of them as causing climate change.  For example 428 respondents ascribed \nresponsibility to Central Government for causing climate change while 1056 suggested \nthat Central Government had a responsibility to tackle it.  Moving briefly into another \narea of the questionnaire (trust) it can be seen that Pearson correlation between \u201etrust of \nthe UK government\u201f and stating that \u201eit is central governments responsibility to tackle \nclimate change\u201f (r = .143, p < .01) suggests that those who trust the government are more \nlikely to say it is the government\u201fs responsibility.  However only 35% of respondents \nsaid they trusted them, while 69% thought it was their responsibility to tackle climate \nchange.  \nTable Three contains Pearson correlation coefficients for GER and responsibility \norientation for both the overall GER score and for the four separate GER groupings. \n-INSERT TABLE THREE ABOUT HERE- \nThere are significant positive correlations between GER scores and responsibility \norientation for causing climate change with the only negative correlations for respondents \n  \n23 \n \nwho answered \u201eother\u201f or \u201edon\u2019t know\u201f. The opposite case is found for those consumers \nresponding to the question \u201eWhose responsibility do you think it is to tackle climate \nchange?\u201f with no statistically significant correlations between GER score and \nresponsibility for tackling climate change.  It can also be seen that the significance of \neach GER grouping differs in terms of responsibility orientation (both in terms of \nresponsible for causing and tackling climate change).  In terms of the Leisure GER the \nresults are quite weak and while overall there is a general increase in GER if you see \nyourself or other individuals as responsible, this does not continue into other \nresponsibility orientations such as perceiving organisations and governments as \nresponsible.  For the Purchasing GER the correlation is more statistically significant with \nthose who see individuals as responsible also displaying higher levels of PEB.  A similar \npattern was also displayed for the Household GER.   \n \nThe Travel GER shows mixed results with certain responsibility orientations (if \nthe consumer sees themselves, service industries or developing countries as responsible \nfor tackling climate change) they will also display a larger GER score.  In general a \nresponsibility orientation of whichever type tends to be correlated more strongly with \nhousehold or purchasing behaviours.   \nTable Four contains Pearson correlation coefficients for GER against a range of \n20 attitude statements contained in the questionnaire. \n-INSERT TABLE FOUR ABOUT HERE- \nOnly three attitude statements correlate significantly with general GER:  \u201eClimate \nchange has occurred many times in human history and it\u2019s part of the natural shifting of \n  \n24 \n \nthe climate\u201f, \u201eIt\u2019s too late to do anything about climate change\u201f and \u201eAttempts to tackle \nclimate change should be coordinated at an international level to be successful\u201f.  \nHowever, the lack of correlation between attitudes and behaviour has been documented \nwidely so the lack of correlation here is perhaps unsurprising (Sutton, 1998; Foxall 2002; \nSheeran 2002).  In terms of the GER groupings, the attitude statements showed some \ninteresting results. \u201eI am concerned about the effects of climate change\u201f correlated \nstrongly with the GERs for Leisure, Purchasing Activities and Travel.  \u201eConsumers can \nhelp reduce the impact of climate change if they can change what they buy on a regular \nbasis\u201f perhaps unsurprising correlated more highly with the GER for Purchasing \nActivities and Household Activities, but also more surprisingly with the GER for Leisure. \n \nTables Five, Six, Seven, Eight and Nine contain results of simultaneous linear \nregression analyses for general GER and each of the GER groupings.  Only those \nstatements which were significant predictors within the models are included in the tables. \nThe significant predictors were also largely supported by subsequent stepwise regression \nanalyses.  Adjusted R Square values for each analysis were:  General GER 0.250, GER \nHousehold Activities 0.145, GER All Travel 0.101, GER Purchasing Activities 0.214 and \nGER Leisure 0.118. This suggests that GER predicts between 10 and 25% of the variance \nin consumers behaviour.  Although not directly comparable due to differing \nmethodologies and measures (the work used a sample of consumers specifically \ninterested in aspects of driving from two Swiss transportation associations) this is lower \nthan the 55% of person\u201fs ecological behaviour that Kaiser and Shimoda (1999) suggest \ncan be predicted by their measure of responsibility judgement.   \n  \n25 \n \n-INSERT TABLES FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT AND NINE ABOUT HERE- \nMost notable across all the regression analyses is that the attitudinal statements form a \nlarger proportion of significant predictors.  Responsibility orientation (both in causing \nand tackling climate change) did however play a larger part taking into account those \npredictors that fell just short of the significance level required (and hence are not included \nin the tables).  In line with the above correlations the answer \u201edon\u2019t know\u201f played a larger \npredictive part than might have been expected.   Within the household activities GER an \nincreased agreement with the statement \u201eclimate change is largely caused by human \nactivities\u201f surprisingly predicted a small reduction in the dependant variable, GER.  \nCommon predictors (of both increases and decreases in GER) across all groupings \nincluded responsibility for causing and tackling climate change being apportioned to \nlocal\/central government and greater agreement with the statements \u201eI am concerned \nabout the effects of climate change\u201f, \u201eI don\u2019t see why I should take action on climate \nchange if other people are not\u201f and \u201eI would switch my custom to companies that are \nworking to reduce climate change\u201f (a greater predictor in general and purchasing activity \nGERs).   \nIt is obviously difficult given the above results and those further contained in the \ntables to provide a definitive answer to research question three.  While the correlation \nanalysis suggests a greater part played by responsibility orientations, especially those \nregarding individuals perceiving themselves and\/or other individuals as responsible, the \nregression analyses suggest a heavier weighting toward the attitudinal statements and \nsome considerably more than others.  While the nature of the data might explain some \n  \n26 \n \ninconsistencies there are still a number of interesting and useful aspects that have been \nhighlighted. \n \nDiscussion & Conclusions \nThis research demonstrates a clear relationship between a consumers\u201f sense of \nenvironmental responsibility and their environmentally-related consumption behaviours. \nAlthough the influence of this sense of responsibility is often weak compared to other \nfactors, it is still significant, and this demonstrates the worth of approaches such as the \nVBN Model in helping to understand PEB. By contrast it shows that the more \nconventional and commonly-used models based on Theory of Planned Behavior and \nTheory of Reasoned Action (Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980; Ajzen 1991), which omit any \nnotion of consumer responsibility, are missing a significant factor.  \n \nThe nature of the relationship between a sense of responsibility and behaviour \nhowever remains intriguing. The assumption people might draw from the VBN Model is \nthat a sense of responsibility would drive environmental behaviours. However, there is \nalso evidence showing that involvement in a behaviour can also shape values (Tucker and \nSpeirs, 2003), this begs the question as to whether involvement in certain environmental \nbehaviours could lessen a consumers\u201f sense of responsibility? As Downing and \nBallantyne (2007) note:  \u201cMany consumers still seek to make changes at the margins of \ntheir lifestyles and do not perceive a need for a fundamental shift in behaviour. \nMoreover, their actions do not appear consistent, well planned or systematic \u2013 when \nasked unprompted what they are doing to confront climate change, most cannot identify \n  \n27 \n \nanything beyond recycling, begging the question whether this has become a token \nbehaviour that discharges responsibility in other areas\u2026\u201d \n \nThe study also showed that, despite the controversy about their uses, socio-\ndemographic variables can still be useful in understanding and predicting pro-\nenvironmental behaviours. The higher GER scores amongst females supported various \nstudies suggesting that females are more concerned than men about the environment in \nrelation to household behaviours (e.g. Teisl et al. 2008). GER also has a positive \nrelationship with Education, supporting findings of other studies (e.g. Teisl et al. 2008). \nThe NRS Social Grade categories did not prove conclusive for GER score, in accord with \nfindings by Consumer Focus (Yates, 2009) that consumers from across all social grades \nengage in some way with certain \u201egreen\u201f behaviours. This rather contradicts the \nfrequently expressed view that environmental issues like climate change are \u201emiddle class \nissues\u2019. GER also has a positive relationship with age, suggesting that either older people \nhave a broader knowledge of environmental responsibility, or that a sense of \nresponsibility is something that matures over time, or a declining sense of responsibility \namongst younger generations as observed in the USA by Wray-Lake et al. (2010).  \n \nConsumer environmental attitudes and knowledge are two of the most commonly \ncited influences on behaviour, and the results provided further support for that. \nConsumers\u201f concern for the environment was generally seen to be a good predictor for a \nhigher GER score, whilst consumers responding \u201eother\u201f or \u201edon\u2019t know\u201f to questions \nabout responsibility for causing or tackling climate change generally had lower levels of \n  \n28 \n \nGER. This suggests that there might be a genuine lack of information or education \namongst this cohort, and an inability to make the relevant connections between the issue \nof climate change and their own lifestyles and behaviours (something which has been \nshown to be important in motivating PEB, Pilgrim et al. 2007). \n  \nThe results of this study add to the growing weight of evidence that consumer \nbehaviour, and the factors that influence it, varies across different types of PEB. \nExploring the differing types of GER, consumers were less affected by feelings of \nresponsibility in their leisure and travel activities even though there was a correlation \nwith the attitude statement that \u201eConsumers can help reduce the impact of climate change \nif they can change what they buy on a regular basis\u2019. This resonates with Becken (2007) \nwho found that, when discussing individual responsibility for GHG emissions, tourists \nwere more likely to consider environmental factors in their every day life activities and \ndecision making as opposed to when undertaking a more \u201eextraordinary\u201f activity or \ndecision to travel: \u201cThe value of freedom to travel is firmly established in the minds of \nmany tourists and limiting travel is considered unacceptable by the (hyper) mobile \ntourists who participated in this research\u201d. Similarly, McDonald  et al. (2006) identified \na consumer segment of \u201eExceptors\u201f who sought to make sustainability orientated changes \nto their lifestyles, but who kept specific types of behaviour outside this decision \nframework (particularly foreign travel and car use).  \n \nThrough focus group research, Niva and Timonen (2008) uncovered that \nconsumers perceived their own opportunities to influence the product-oriented market as \n  \n29 \n \nsmall; rather they attributed the responsibility to product manufacturers. Realising an \nelement of control over \u201eextraordinary\u201f consumption habits, such as travel is therefore a \nkey challenge in incorporating such behaviours within consumer perceptions of their own \nsphere of influence and responsibility. It also raises interesting questions about whether \nconsumers feel responsible for a choice they make in a supermarket aisle or in their own \nkitchen, but would not feel in any way responsible for the fact that an aircraft they were \nsitting in was flying. This could be an interesting focus for further research. \n \n This exploratory study has the key advantages compared to many other studies of \nemploying a multi-dimensional approach to PEB and employing a relatively large sample \nsize (for example, Kaiser and Schimoda (1999) surveyed 445 people; and Van Kenhove \net al.\u201fs (2001) study had a sample of 286). Its use of the GER score also provides a novel \napproach to approximating the net environmental impacts of domestic consumption \nbehaviour which could be developed further. It generated some interesting if tentative \nfindings, which open up avenues for further research on the topic of responsibility (and in \nparticular in terms of consumer responsiveness to environmental issues when they hold \nothers more responsible than themselves) - an issue that until now has been largely \noverlooked in the literature.   \n \nThe findings however need to be considered in the light of the study\u201fs limitations, \nparticularly those linked to the roots of the data collection process in a business-focussed \nsurvey that was not designed for purely academic research. Furthermore, this survey \nshares a limitation that is widespread within green consumer research of relying on self-\n  \n30 \n \nreported behaviours or behavioural intentions rather than measuring actual behaviour \n(Follows and Jobber, 2000). In view of the frequently reported gap between attitudes and \nbehaviour (Vermeir and Verbeke, 2006, Zacca\u00ef, 2006) it is important to attempt to \ndevelop direct or indirect measures that assess behaviour, to overcome the reporting of \nsocially desirable answers or tendencies to over-estimate PEB (Vinning and Ebreo, \n2002).  In relation to this study, an avenue for future research would be to seek to \nresearch the influence of perceived consumer responsibility in relation to climate change \ncauses and solutions on actual PEBs. \n \nA key implication of this research is that there is unquestionably a perception of a \nshared responsibility for dealing with climate change amongst consumers. This could \ncreate opportunities for companies, governments and NGOs to develop strategies and \npartnership which build on this and which could perhaps benefit from complementary \nrelationships about their varying responsibilities and resources for tackling climate \nchange. Halpern and Bates (2004) suggest that co-production and a sense of partnership \nbetween state, individuals and communities should succeed in increasing notions of \npersonal responsibility in areas such as climate change, amongst others. Consequently, \nsince the majority of survey respondents felt that Central Government should be \nresponsible for leading on a solution for climate change, despite low trust in them; this \ntherefore implies that there is an opportunity for government to further cooperate with \nNGOs and Businesses, along the lines of the \u201eNew Social Compact\u201f outlined by \nBrugmann and Prahalad (2007) in increasing notions of personal consumer responsibility. \nEffectively communicating such developments to consumers in such a way that \n  \n31 \n \nencourages them to take responsibility for changing their behaviours will be an important \nfuture challenge for commercial and social marketers alike.  \n \n \n  \n32 \n \nReferences \n \nAjzen, I.
