BLOWER\n(Received 2nd April 1993)\nLet L be a positive invertible self-adjoint operator in L2(X;C). Using transference methods for locally\nbounded groups of operators we obtain multipliers for the group of complex powers V on vector-valued\nLebesgue spaces. Using a Mellin inversion formula, we derive a sufficient condition for a function to be a\nmultiplier of the semigroup e~'L on W{X;E) where \u00a3 is a HMD Banach space and 1 < p < oo.\n1991 Mathematics subject classification: 42A45, 47D03, 46E50.\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we are concerned with multipliers for semigroups generated by a\nLaplace type operator. Let X be a locally compact manifold and \\i a positive a-finite\nRadon measure supported on X. Let L be a densely defined positive self-adjoint\noperator in L2(X; C). By the spectral theorem there is a resolution of the identity P(dA)\nconsisting of an increasing family of orthogonal projections P[0, A]. We suppose that\nthe projection P{0, corresponding to the singleton {0} is zero. We can define a family of\noperators\noo\nexp(-rL)= jexp(-tA)P(dA) (t>0) (1)\no\nwhich by Theorems 22.3.1 and 12.3.1 of [4] forms a Co contraction semigroup on\nL2(X;C) with generator (-L).\nIn many examples of interest, exp( \u2014 tL) also defines a semigroup on L\"(X;C). For\ntechnical reasons we suppose that there is a common core # so that L may be\nunambiguously defined on all the U spaces. We state the technical hypotheses here and\nprovide examples in Section 5.\nHypotheses 1.1. (i) Let <& be the space of functions\ne f) L\"(X;C):support((P\/)\/)(dA))<=(8,\u00a3-1), e>ol . (2)\nl<p<00 J\nWe assume that <\u20ac is a dense linear subspace of LP(X\\C) for 1 <p<co.\n(ii) The space # is a core for L. We suppose that L is closable on L\"(X;C) for\n1 <p< oo and its graph closure is equal to the closure of its restriction to <6.\n241\n242 G. BLOWER\n(iii) We assume that L generates a Co semigroup on L\"(X;C) for 1 <p<ao.\n(iv) We let E be some Banach space and for 1 ^ p < oo introduce the Bochner-\nLebesgue space LP(X;E) of strongly measurable \u00a3-valued functions with ||\/(x)||g\n\/i-integrable as in [4, p. 78]. Suppose that e~tL\u00aeI, defined initially on # <g) E, may be\nextended to a Co semigroup, also denoted exp( \u2014 tL), on LP(X;E) for l < p < o o . We\nassume that <6\u00aeE forms a comon core for L \u00ae \/ in the LP{X; E) spaces.\nDefinition. An LP(X;E) multiplier of the semigroup exp( \u2014 tL) is a function b\nbelonging to L\\oc{0, oo) for which the strong operator limit of Bochner integrals\nT\nM(b)ri= lim \\ b(t)e\\p{-tL)rjdt (t] e L\"(X; \u00a3)) (3)\nexists and defines a bounded linear operator on W{X; E).\nWe wish to give sufficient conditions on b that it define an L\"(X;E) multiplier. In\norder to make progress, it is necessary to impose geometrical conditions on the Banach\nspace E.\nDefinition. A Banach space E is said to be a UMD space if there is a constant CE\nfor which\n2 2\n dco (4)\nfor all transforms of finite martingale difference sequences (dn) with values in E by\nconstants an with \\an\\ ^  1.\nBurkholder and Bourgain showed that \u00a3 is a UMD space if and only if the Hilbert\ntransform is bounded on Z\/(R;\u00a3) for 1 <p<co. See [1, Theorem 2.7]. For a discussion\nof examples and a spectral theory of groups of operators on UMD spaces we refer the\nreader to [1]. Here we simply record that Lq(R;C) is a UMD space for 1<<7<OO but\nnot for q = 1 nor q = co.\nOur multiplier theorems are proved in Sections 3 and 4 for UMD spaces using the\ngroup L~'u of imaginary powers of L. Under technical conditions stated below, the\nmultipliers for the semigroup e~'L and the group L~'u are related by\n-'\nLdt = f-. J r(-s)B{s)Lsds (c<0) (5)\n0 ^ f c-ioo\nwhere B(s) is the Mellin transform of tb(t).\n2. Transference method\nOur method of proving that multipliers are bounded on LP(X;E) is to take a\nMULTIPLIERS FOR SEMIGROUPS 243\nmultiplier theorem for the group of translation operators on the real line and transfer it\nto a group of operators on L\"(X; E). We begin by presenting a transference principle to\ndeal with locally bounded groups of operators. See [1, Theorems 4.1, 5.6] for the case of\nuniformly bounded Co groups of operators.\nDefinition. Let ui\u2014>TU be a strongly continuous representation of the real line as a\nCo group of bounded linear operators on a Banach space E. Then the operator norms\n||7^||\u00a3 are uniformly bounded on compact subsets of R by [4, p. 304]. We define the\nmodular function of T to be\nT(U) = sup{||Ts| |\u00a3:|s|g|U|} (U 6R). (6)\nBy an application of the uniform boundedness theorem given in [4, p. 306], the function\nT(U) is at most of exponential growth in \\u\\.\nTheorem 2.1.

For \\s\\^u we have\nJ a(t-s)k(t)dt p (10)\nHence we can estimate the integral in the previous expression (9) by\n\u00bb;*)\u2022 (11)\nNow we estimate ||fe(0||\u00a3 pointwise to give\nJ ||*(t)||gdtg J suP | s | , 2 u | |T^| | |d^4uT(2<| |g| | i (12)\n- oo - 2 u\nCombining (11) and (12) with (9) we obtain\nSince r(w) is at most of exponential growth in u we have that T(2U)^T(M) 2 . Taking p'h\nroots of (13), we obtain the stated result.\n3. Multipliers for semigroups\nLet us suppose that L satisfies the Hypotheses 1.1 (i)-(iv). Then we can define a Co\nunitary group of operators L~ ' \" (M\u00a3 |R) on L2(X;C) by the functional calculus of the\nself-adjoint operator L. Hence we can define a family of operators TU = L~'U \u00ae \/ on\n# \u00ae \/. If Tu extends to define a strongly continuous group of operators on LP(X; \u00a3), then\nwe can use the transference techniques of the previous section to construct multipliers.\nWe will use the Mellin transform to convert transferred convolution operators (7)\ninvolving L~'u into multipliers (3) involving e~'L. We will write L~'u for L~iu\u00ael and\nsimilarly abbreviate the other notation.\nDefinition. Let 5 be a function for which t~\"b(i)eLl(O, oo) for al<a<a2 where\nOrgff!.

Using familiar identities satisfied by the Gamma function we get\nHence by (19) we have\nwm _C+'I\u00b0 (m-\\+s){m-2 + s)...(\n2niwT(m)\nl)ncosec(ns).\nn cosec(7rs)Ls ds(c < 0) (34)\nas an identity of operators on\nWe estimate the right hand side of (34) by the technique of the proof of Theorem 4.1.\nThe line of integration in (34) is replaced by a curve consisting of the imaginary axis\n<r = 0 with an indentation about a + iu = 0. We require to estimate the integrand of (34)\non 9?s = 0. For real values of u we have\n(m \u2014 1 \u2014 iu)(m \u2014 2 \u2014 i u ) . . .

The formula (34) with m = 1 is equivalent to a Mellin transform formula\ngiven by Sneddon [6, p. 521].\n5. Examples\nExample 5.1. Let A be the classical Laplace operator on the real line and E be any\nUMD space. It is known that ( \u2014 A)'\"\u00ae\/ defines a Co group of operators on L\"(R;E)\nfor l<p<oo. The modular function T(M) is of polynomial growth in this case [6,\nTheorem 1.1]. Conversely, if ( \u2014 A)1\"\u00ae\/ is a locally bounded group of operators on\nLP(R;\u00a3) for some p with 1 <p< oo then \u00a3 is a UMD space [3, p. 402].\nExample 5.2. The conditions (ii) and (iii) of Hypotheses 1.1 are satisfied when L is\nthe generator of a symmetric diffusion semigroup exp( \u2014 tL). We take X to be a smooth\ncomplete manifold and suppose that in local co-ordinates L has the shape\nLf=-e{x)-1 t \u00b1(ajk(x)~f)-c(x)f {feC?(X))\nj,k=l OXj\\ \u00b0Xk J\nwith [aJt(x)] positive definite, e(x)>0 and c(x)^0. Under general conditions on the\ncoefficients the closure of ( \u2014 L)\\C\u2122(X;C) generates a Co contraction semigroup on\nLP(X;C) for 1 ^p^oo. See [2, p. 412], [7, p. 66]. The Poisson semigroup, which is also\na contraction semigroup on LP(X;C) for l ^p^oo , may be obtained by subordination.\nThe integer powers Lm (m^l) are essentially self-adjoint on Cf(X;C). The condition (i)\nof 1.1 does not generally hold when X is compact since the spectrum is discrete and L\nneed not be invertible. In this case one considers semigroups defined on the orthogonal\ncomplement of the zero eigenspace of L.\nIt follows from Stein's multiplier theorem for symmetric diffusion semigroups [6, p.\n121] that the imaginary powers L'u of L axe bounded on LP(X;C) for 1 <p< oo with\nfor large values of \\u\\.\nAcknowledgements.
