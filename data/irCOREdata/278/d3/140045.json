A key driver of this\nchange is the advent of Customer Relationship Management which, underpinned by\ninformation systems convergence and the development of supporting software,\npromises significantly to improve the implementation of Relationship Marketing\nprinciples.\nIn this paper we explore the three main issues that can enable (or hinder) the\ndevelopment of Customer Relationship Management in the service sector; the\norganisational issues of culture and communication, management metrics and cross-\nfunctional integration \u2013 especially between marketing and information technology.\nKeywords\nCustomer relationship management\nCross-functional integration\nInformation technology\nRelationship Marketing\n2Introduction\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) has its roots in relationship marketing\nwhich is based in turn on the formative work by Berry (1983), the IMP Group (see e.g.\nFord, 1990) and Christopher et al (1991). Seminal contributions to the relationship\nmarketing debate were made by Reichheld and Sasser (1990) and Reichheld (1996)\nreporting on the customer retention work of Bain and Co. These findings indicated\nthat a 5% increase in customer retention resulted in an increase in average customer\nlifetime value of between 35% and 95%, leading to significant improvements in\ncompany profitability ( see Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Impact of a 5% Increase in Retention Rate on Customer Net Present\nValue\nIndustry % Increase in\nCustomer NPV\nAdvertising Agency 95\nLife Insurance 90\nBank 85\nInsurance 84\nCar Service 81\nCredit Card 75\nLaundry 45\nFacilities Management 40\nSoftware 35\nSource: adapted from Reichheld, 1996\nReichheld concluded that there are six underlying reasons why retained customers are\nmore profitable (p. 39):\n\uf0b7 Customer acquisition costs may be high, so customers may not become profitable\nunless they are retained for one or more years;\n\uf0b7 There will be a stream of profits from the customer in each year after acquisition\ncosts are covered;\n3\uf0b7 Customers buy more over time, so revenues go up; Companies become more\nefficient at serving them (there is a learning curve to the relationship), so costs go\ndown;\n\uf0b7 Retained and satisfied customers may refer other potential customers;\n\uf0b7 The relationship has a value to the customer too, so that retained customers tend to\nbecome less price-sensitive.\nThe purpose of relationship marketing is to improve long run profitability by shifting\nfrom transaction-based marketing, with its emphasis on winning new customers, to\ncustomer retention through effective management of customer relationships\n(Christopher et al., p.19, 1991). While the development of theory in relationship\nmarketing continues unabated, the key question facing practitioners is, how can this\nshift in management focus be implemented in practice?\nThis paper sets out to address issues concerning relationship marketing\nimplementation through the application of Customer Relationship Management\n(CRM) and related technologies.\nCustomer Relationship Management\nCRM complements the relationship marketing perspective. It is defined by Couldwell\n(1998) as, \u201c. . . a combination of business process and technology that seeks to\nunderstand a company\u2019s customers from the perspective of who they are, what they\ndo, and what they\u2019re like.\u201d As is the case with relationship marketing, CRM focuses\non customer retention (Lockard, 1998; Deighton, 1998) and relationship development\n(Galbreath, 1998). According to Kutner and Cripps (1997), CRM is founded on four\nrelationship-based tenets:\n\uf0b7 Customers should be managed as important assets.\n\uf0b7 Customer profitability varies; not all customers are equally desirable.\n\uf0b7 Customers vary in their needs, preferences, buying behaviour and price sensitivity.\n\uf0b7 By understanding customer drivers and customer profitability, companies can\ntailor their offerings to maximise the overall value of their customer portfolio.\n4Anton (1996) characterises CRM as an integrated approach to managing relationships.\nHowever, critically, he underpins relationship management with \u201ccontinuous\nimprovement or re-engineering\u201d of customer value through better service recovery\nand competitive positioning of the offer (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: CRM \u2013 an Integrated Approach to managing relationships\nOthers emphasise a technological rather than a relational perspective to CRM;\nPeppers and Rogers (1995) claim that, \u201c\u2026the marketplace of the future is undergoing\na technology-driven metamorphosis.\u201d, which Kutner and Cripps (1997) encapsulate\nas, \u201cdata-driven marketing\u201d.\nNotwithstanding these technological perspectives, the philosophical bases of CRM are\na relationship orientation, customer retention and superior customer value created\nthrough process management. IT is the \u2018glue\u2019 that holds these together and enables the\nwhole to be operationalised. In consequence, the successful implementation of CRM\nrequires Marketing and IT to work closely together to maximise the return on\n\uf0e3\nV a lu e R e co ve ry C o m p e titive P o s itio n\nIIm age\nQ ua lity P rice\nE m e rgen c ies\nC o m p la in ts \/\nInqu iries\nT echn ica l\nP rob lem s\nC onsum er\nC om m erc ia l Indus tria l\nC o n tin u o u s im p ro ve m e n t o r\nre -e n g in e e rin g\nN ew and\nexis tin g\ncus tom ers\nS upp lie rs , A lliances\na nd Jo in t V en tu re\nIn te rna l M a rke ts R ec ru itm en t\nA dvoca tes\nIn fluence rsM a n a g in g R e la tio n sh ip s w ith\nS ta ke h o ld e rs\nA d a p te d fro m A n to n 1 9 9 6 a n d C h ris to p h e r e t a l 1 9 9 1\n5customer information. This will almost certainly require a degree of cross-functional\nreorganisation.\nIn summary, the key characteristics of CRM are:\n\uf0b7 A customer relationship perspective aimed at the long-term retention of selected\ncustomers.\n\uf0b7 Gathering and integrating information on customers.\n\uf0b7 Use of dedicated software to analyse this information (often in real time).\n\uf0b7 Segmentation by expected customer lifetime value.\n\uf0b7 Micro-segmentation of markets according to customers\u2019 needs and wants.\n\uf0b7 Customer value creation through process management (Hammer & Champy,\n1993; Hamel & Prahalad, 1994).\n\uf0b7 Customer value delivery through service tailored to micro-segments, facilitated by\ndetailed, integrated customer profiles.\n\uf0b7 A shift in emphasis from managing product portfolios to managing portfolios of\ncustomers, necessitating changes to working practices and sometimes to\norganisational structure.\nIn essence, CRM provides management with the opportunity to implement\nrelationship marketing on a company-wide basis. However, for CRM to be\nsuccessful, all of these activities need to be managed in combination. What makes\nthis possible are the recent advances in enterprise software. One company pioneering\nthese developments, Sun Microsystems, identifies three levels of customer\ninformation technology. At the simplest level are reporting tools that link sales staff\nwith other elements of the business. Then there is online analytical programming\n(OLAP) which analyses data as it comes in, enabling users to \u2018drill down\u2019 through\nlevels of data to examine exceptions to purchase patterns and to understand trends and\nanomalies. The third level, data mining, is more sophisticated still, and enables\nobscure correlations to be identified. It might, for example, reveal that sales of baby\nfood increase if it is placed near to the beer shelves in a supermarket! (Sunday Times,\n1999).\n6The Adoption of CRM by Industry Sectors\nDespite the enthusiasm of many commentators, acceptance of CRM is by no means\nuniversal. Woods and Remondi (1996) found that many high-technology companies\ndo not recognise the potential benefits of CRM to sales effectiveness and long-term\nmarketing success and still use traditional marketing approaches. Others think that\nthese classical marketing skills, and the basics of quality, cost and convenience, rather\nthan \u201cexpensive IT and neural networks\u201d, are what is really needed to give an\norganisation a competitive edge (Hagel, Bergsma, & Dheer, 1996). Certainly there is\nanecdotal evidence that the finance sector is trying to run before it can walk when it\nimplements advanced IT\/marketing practices before absorbing the basic underlying\ntenet of customer orientation. A report by the Consumers\u2019 Association concluded\nthat, far from rewarding customers for loyalty, banks often leave them out of pocket\n(Consumers\u2019 Association, 1999). Criticisms of this sort led the government to\ncommission the Cruickshank Banking Report which estimated that the major UK\nbanks overcharge their customers by between \u00a33 and \u00a35 billion per year. Payments,\nthough efficiently automated, still take just as long to make as they did in Victorian\ntimes. Consequently, banking services to small businesses are to be referred to the\nCompetition Commission (The Times, 2000).\nEven without such pressure from government, the need for change in the financial\nsector is already being driven by economic need and competition. The Cruikshank\nReport acknowledges that there is no need for action in the individual banking sector\nwhere banks are experiencing strong competition from new market entrants who can\noffer better customer service without the banks\u2019 legacy of perceived inefficiency, poor\nservice, and mis-selling (Mitchell, 1997; Ratcliff, 1998).\nIn other industry sectors hard evidence of an increasing focus on customer profitability,\nlifetime value, retention and satisfaction, is reported by Abram Hawkes and Market\nShape. They found that 90% of organisations recognise the value of customer\nretention: 60% thought that there were links between customer loyalty and the\nduration of the customer relationship, and 45% said that loyalty marketing yielded a\nbetter return on investment than expenditure on advertising (Reed, 1997). Successful\ncompanies manage customer relationships based on potential profitability (Economist\n7Intelligence Unit, 1998).\nThere is growing recognition in the literature that companies will have to adapt to\nsurvive, and that this means fundamental changes in the way that firms are organised\n(for example Webster, 1992; McDonald et al., 2001). A key challenge facing firms in\nmaking this transition is the efficient integration of CRM initiatives into whole-\ncompany customer relationship development.\nCommitting to CRM: Organisational Issues\nA major change is already underway. The proportion of firms organised around their\ncustomers is expected to rise from the current level of about 20% to 50% by 2002. By\nthat time, about three-quarters of firms expect to achieve a high degree of integration\nbetween sales and IT functions in contrast to less than 30% in 1998. To support these\nchanges, the proportion of companies operating a data warehouse is expected to more\nthan double to over 80% (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 1998).\nManagement academics have been preaching customer orientation for decades, but\npractice has remained stolidly product orientated (see e.g. Levitt, 1960 & 1986;\nDrucker, 1973). However, a combination of factors has now simultaneously obliged\nand enabled firms to re-organise around their customers; widespread changes in\nbusiness processes, growth of the services sector, and the availability of cost-effective\nsoftware solutions to the challenges of \u2018mass-customisation\u2019. Although these factors\nare facilitating the shift from product management to a customer focus, the shift will\nnot be easily achieved. The necessary changes will impact on the ways that\ncompanies view their customers and how they treat them, how they are themselves\norganised and how they measure and reward success.\nAs companies attempt to re-orientate themselves around customers, individual\nemployees will have to come to terms with changing cultural norms, organisational\nstructures and the way that their performance is measured and rewarded. Studies by\nMartiny (1998) and Braganza & Myers (1996) indicate that the commitment of senior\nmanagement is critical to success. This was reinforced in a META Group report\n8(1998) that singled out the Chief Executive Officer\u2019s (CEO) involvement as a key\nsuccess factor for CRM projects, concluding that, \u201cInvesting in CRM technology\nwithout a customer-oriented cultural mindset \u2013 inherited hierarchically throughout\nthe enterprise from the CEO \u2013 is like throwing money into a black hole\u201d.\nData management systems are the tools that enable the whole firm to reorganise\naround its customers, but they are not sufficient in themselves. Companies that regard\ncustomer information management as a marketing department responsibility and leave\nit in the hands of marketing planners and product managers in the expectation of short\nterm payoffs are missing the point. The adoption of customer-oriented strategies\nrequires an organisational culture that is adaptive and responsive to change, and the\nquality of communication within an organisation is an important aspect of any change\ninitiative. Failure to successfully communicate a change initiative and its implications\nfor employees can lead to failure; an effective internal communication strategy needs\nto be in place, so that there is \u2018buy-in\u2019 to the initiative led by the top-management\nteam. However, if cultural change is to take place, then the way that success is\nmeasured and rewarded must change first (Jennings, 1997).\nCRM Adoption and Management Metrics\nSpitler (1997) reinforces Jenning\u2019s view, pointing out the failure of many industries to\nadopt appropriate metrics, \u201cIf there is a single shortfall today in the [banking]\nindustry\u2019s migration to a customer relationship model of the business, it is the lack of\nadequate, insightful customer MIS (Marketing Information Systems) and customer\nperformance metrics.\u201d Many commentators are also concerned about the\nshortcomings of existing performance measurements, such as Return on Investment\n(ROI) which:\n\uf0b7 Does not incorporate off-balance sheet items, especially the intangible assets that\nincreasingly influence business performance.\n\uf0b7 Does not encourage management to invest in assets that do not influence short-\nterm performance, and so does not strategically position the organisation for the\nfuture.\n\uf0b7 Is subject to accounting manipulation and other factors that distort the reported\nperformance of the firm.\n9(Adapted from Lusch and Harvey, 1994)\nKaplan & Norton\u2019s (1992) Balanced Score Card approach was the first significant\nattempt to provide metrics across the enterprise. This was followed by Edvinsson,\nwho founded the Intellectual Capital movement which stresses the importance of\nmetrics to address, \u201cthe possession of knowledge, applied experience, organisational\ntechnology, customer relationships and professional skills that provide knowledge-\nbased companies with a competitive edge in the market place\u201d (Edvinsson & Malone,\n1997). It is the quality of an organisation\u2019s customer information and its ability to\nmanage customer relationships that are going to be the critical measures of long term\nsuccess. Technology, process, organisation and customer orientation are all vitally\nimportant to this, but it is the individual employees who are the building blocks of\ncustomer relationships. Therefore, the measurement system should facilitate and\nreward customer orientation. Meeting the organisational challenges of customer\norientation, marketing and technology skills will become increasingly more important\nfor employees. Constant training to reinforce existing procedures and to implement\nnewly created programmes is needed to maintain a competitive edge (McDonald,\n1993).\nExamples of good practice include Dell Computer Corporation, whose technicians are\ntrained to hone the customer relation skills they need for telephone support and\nproblem guidance, and to focus directly on the customer\u2019s needs without using\ntechnical jargon. The Ritz-Carlton hotel group combines employee training with\ninformation systems to provide its guests with superior service, whenever they stay\nwith the hotel chain. Employees are given a \u2018guest preference pad\u2019 to record every\npreference gleaned from conversation, or observation. These are entered daily onto a\nworld-wide database so that the requirements of a guest staying at any other Ritz-\nCarlton in the world are immediately known to the staff. In both cases, staff training\nand motivation are vital; a great deal depends upon accurate and consistent recording\nof information and the ability of staff to multi-task across functional boundaries\n(Ryals, Knox and Maklan, 2000).\nCRM Convergence and Cross-functional Integration.\n10\nThe key principles involved in relationship marketing are the gathering, co-ordinating\nand analysing of accurate data on customers, developing marketing strategies that\npersonalise the relationship, and maximising the value to the organisation by\nfocussing on higher value customers. This calls for a considerable degree of cross-\nfunctional co-operation. For example, all of the departments that have dealings with\ncustomers (e.g. accounts, despatch, sales, customer service and even distributors and\nagents) normally hold data on them. Organising the whole firm around its customers\nrequires the convergence of these disparate information systems in order to accelerate\nprocesses and facilitate \u201cwhole customer\u201d information sharing. This is a key CRM\nrole, \u201cCRM integrates marketing, sales and service functions through business\nprocess automation, technology solutions and information resources to maximise\neach customer contact. CRM facilitates relationships among enterprises, their\ncustomers, business suppliers and employees.\u201d (Galbreath, 1998). This convergence\nof business functions assists in cost reduction, efficiency improvements and increased\nproductivity (Elliott, 1997) and should pervade the culture of the organisation.\nHowever, Hall (1997) found that, even where organisations have technological\nintegration, performance integration does not always follow. Many departments and\nindividuals see customer handling as a sales or marketing function, and regard the\nrelease of their data to another function as signalling a loss of power. Software\ndevelopers are becoming increasingly aware of these problems. By learning from\nimplementation difficulties in early Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, the\nnew wave of post-ERP systems will address, \u201c\u2026the cultural and organisational shifts\nneeded to align IT and business-management objectives once and for all.\u201d (Stein and\nCaldwell, 1998).\nWhile the role of key account manager plays an important part in customer\nrelationships, functional boundaries can limit managers\u2019 ability to fulfil the key\naccount role effectively. Therefore, in order to neutralise the negative impact which\nfunctional boundaries can have on the successful implementation of CRM, an\nintegrated approach is required, with marketing, operations, information technology,\nand financial accounting all participating (Morris, 1994). Although the ultimate goal\nof integration may be the segment-of-one, where product \/ service offers are tailored\n11\nspecifically to the individual, but is not yet achievable in most companies. Even\nrealigning to serve a \u2018segment-of-several\u2019 requires far greater cohesion between\nbusiness units than currently exists (Larson, 1996).\nHall (1997) notes that the critical interface is between marketing and CRM\ntechnology. An understanding of the perspective from both of these disciplines is a\nprerequisite of cross-functional integration:\nThe Marketing Perspective\nThe marketing perspective on CRM hinges on its potential to offer better customer\nservice, and to improve marketing effectiveness through better focus (McDonald and\nWilson, 1999; Bessen, 1993). IT can help improve customer service in a number of\nareas, including reliability, efficiency, and communications as well as quality control\nand service monitoring (Berkley and Gupta, 1994)\nCRM systems offer operational improvements (Stein and Caldwell, 1998), the\nopportunity to capture and analyse information about purchasing behaviour \u2013 often in\nreal time (Hagel and Sacconaghi, 1996) and long-term success through deeper and\ncloser customer relationships (Beckett-Camarata, Camarata, & Barker, 1998).\nDetailed customer profiles facilitate precise matching of marketing offers to prospects\n(Harrison, 1993), and can be used to track the effectiveness of marketing programmes\n(Mann, 1990), as well as providing the basis for future planning (Shani and Chalasani,\n1993). Customers also benefit when product \/ service offers are tailored to them\nindividually or in micro-segments and can lead to greater loyalty (Mitchell, 1998).\nAccording to Schulz (1996), the combination of customer demands and new enabling\ntechnologies make the move to one-to-one marketing inevitable.\nConversely, customer data analysis and profiling also enables an organisation to\nidentify the customers it does not want to serve. The Pareto rule suggests that 80% of\nprofits are generated by 20% of customers, but in some industries even more extreme\ndifferences in customer profitability exist, \u201cSome commercial banks have found that\n10% of their current account customers are responsible for more than 100% of their\n12\nprofits (i.e. the other 90% are, on average, loss-making)\u201d (Stone, McFarlane, Visram\nand Kimmel, 1996).\nAlthough developments in CRM have often been short-term and uncoordinated in the\npast, recognition of the need for cross-functional, IT integration is now so strong\namong marketing practitioners that integration of the sales system with other business\nprocesses is the highest priority for sales and marketing investment (McDonald and\nWilson, 1999; Ferguson and Shaw, 1996). However, despite this, a very recent survey\nby Simpson Carpenter Research of 100 global companies reveals that CRM budgets\nstill seem to be allocated across business functions on a rather piecemeal basis, with\nless than 25% of firms holding a central, enterprise budget (Internet Business, 2001).\nIT departments were found to be the main custodians of CRM budgeting (see Figure\n3).\nFigure 3: CRM budget holders\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nIT\nSpread across different divisions\nGeneral corporate budget\nNo such budget\nSales & Marketing\nPR\nSource: Simpson Carpenter Research\n%\nThe IT perspective\nAccording to Schultz (1993), the IT perspective is that changes in CRM practice are\nbeing driven both by evolving customer demand and by developments in the enabling\ntechnologies. Despite this, IT managers do not always see customer development as\npart of their business challenge, and some are reluctant to share customer data with\nother departments because such information is their power-base. It is often cross-\nfunctional integration problems like this, rather than technological problems, that are\n13\nthe major impairment to progress (Domegan, 1996; Stone, McFarlane, Visram and\nKimmel, 1993; Elliott, 1997).\nSome of the responsibility for this lack of cross-functional integration lies with senior\nmanagers who fail to recognise the importance of the technological underpinning for\nCRM. According to Hewson (1999), board level support for major IT projects is rare\n\u2013 though very helpful when it happens. Rees-Mogg (1997) attributes this, in part, to\nboard members\u2019 superficial understanding of IT combined with their inability to\ndecide what they need. This in turn contributes directly to the difficulties that IT\nmanagers experience in scoping out CRM projects where the organisational goalposts\nseem to move continuously. Board directors, for their part, can feel that investment in\nIT projects is often much higher, and the benefits much lower, than promised.\nCriticisms such as this have led to pressure on IT managers. Grindley (1995) notes\nthat there is still no general acceptance at board level of the need for large scale\nspending on IT infrastructure and often financial benefits are attached to IT projects\nthat are not expected from other parts of the company.\nFor their part, IT managers sometimes feel that they have a better vision for the\nbusiness than line directors (Hewson, 1999). Their challenge is selling their vision to\nthe board. According to Grindley (1995), IT managers have even been known to\nupwardly adjust the numbers for return on investment in order to push through the\nchanges they believe are fundamental to the long-term success of the business,\ndisguised as short-term efficiency gains (McDonald and Wilson, 1999).\nA major concern for IT practitioners contemplating a major investment in CRM\ntechnology is the high failure rate of IT projects. In a series of studies cited by\nLeverick, Littler, Bruce and Wilson (1998) they quote from a survey of 400 British\nand Irish companies which found that only 11% of respondents claimed their\ninstallation had been successful. In another, it is claimed that between 30-40% of IT\nprojects realised no appreciable benefits at all. A third study found that three-quarters\nof IT projects were either uncompleted or not used when they were completed.\nHowever, from the IT manager\u2019s perspective, the main problem is more about\n14\nmanagement rather than IT failures. These management issues include: absence of\nstrong sponsorship, a lack of cultural readiness, inadequate supporting budgets and an\nabsence of complementary customer management skills (Stone, Woodcock, Foss et al,\n1998). The British Computer Society\u2019s Technical Board agrees that many project\nfailures are due to business needs not being adequately translated into IT strategy.\nConsequently, the Society has recently approved the formation of a new Specialist\nGroup for people working as the interface between IT and business users. The aim of\nthis Group is to transform the relationship between business and IT departments and\ndefine a new career path for IT people who they say are currently struggling with little\nor no recognition. This is very much to the profession\u2019s credit, but the view from the\nother side of the business interface is less encouraging: a recent survey endorsed by\nthe Institute of Directors showed that about half of UK directors had never been\nbriefed on their company\u2019s technology \u2013 and never intend to have such a briefing\n(Kavanagh, 2000).\nManagerial Implications\nIT has the potential to transform relationship marketing by generating market\nknowledge, supporting group decision-making, and facilitating customer transactions\n(Business Intelligence 1994). The financial services industry has taken an early lead\nin CRM implementation (Codington and Wilson, 1994) because its transactions are\nessentially IT-based, and these firms already hold a wealth of information about\nindividual customers. However, the use of technology on its own is not sufficient.\nAlthough most financial services companies now have at least some form of customer\nmarketing database, they do not always perform well in supporting customer\ndevelopment (Naval, 1998; Anon, 1993). Developments in IT must be combined with\na relationship marketing philosophy that calls for the re-organisation of the firm\naround its customers. Re-organisation of the firm around its customers has some\nimmediate implications for managers:\n\uf0b7 A culture change that recognises that customers, not just products, drive\nprofits. Marketing actions must, therefore, focus on long-term customer\nrelationships, not just the short-term campaigns.\n15\n\uf0b7 A change in business measurement and incentives so that they reflect this\nnew culture. For marketing, this might mean setting targets for customer\nretention as well as for new customer acquisition; for IT, this might mean\nmeasuring the success of a CRM technology project in terms of its\ncontribution to building relationships with customers rather than its\narchitecture and functionality.\n\uf0b7 A change in working practices so that information is shared between\ndepartments to build up a picture of the firm\u2019s total relationship with the\ncustomer. This may also entail a change in organisational structure from\ntraditional functional silos to cross-functional teams.\nTwo technology issues are critical: a strategic view of investment in properly managed\nIT, and an enterprise-wide approach to the use and integration of IT systems\n(McDonald and Wilson, 1999; Haapaniemi, 1996; Tavinen, 1995). The importance of\ntechnology in CRM implementation is such that these issues of strategic investment in\nIT and integrated IT systems may have to be addressed directly through:\n\uf0b7 A clearer view about the business case for CRM investments which needs\nto be built around the longer-term impact of such investments on the firm\u2019s\nrelationship with its customers, and not the short-term tactical benefits.\n\uf0b7 Acceptance that CRM technology investments should be an enterprise-wide\ndecision, heralding an end to small-scale projects that fail when their\nsuccess in one business unit leads to ill-judged and hurried attempts to scale\nthem across the organisation, often against the better judgement of the IT\nmanagers.\n\uf0b7 Board support for the decision to invest in CRM, with board-level\nrepresentation for the project. Top management buy-in must be seen to be\ntaking place.\n\uf0b7 Commitment to providing customer information to the \u2018front line\u2019 of staff\nwho interface with customers, and breaking down the barriers of ownership\nassociated with customer information.\nIn summary, successful implementation of CRM will require more effective\nmanagement of functional interdependencies through process teams (Parson, Zeisser\n16\nand Waitman, 1996), and revisions in the ways that employee performance is\nmeasured and rewarded. Such a radical shift in expectations and behaviour towards\nCRM can only be achieved with the full commitment and support of the board and\nsenior management (Fletcher and Wright, 1996; Perrien, Filiatrault and Ricard, 1993).\nReferences\nAnton, J.
