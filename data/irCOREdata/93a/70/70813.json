Indeed some countries may soon only have\nsecondary forest remaining (Castelletta et al. 2000,\nLugo & Helmer 2004, Wright & Muller-Landau 2006).\nRegenerating forests in the Brazilian Amazon cover a\nthird of deforested land (Perz & Skole 2003), as converted\nland is frequently abandoned due to low productivity\n(Nepstad et al. 1991). However, little is known about the\nresponse of faunal communities to large-scale tropical\nforest regeneration (DeWalt et al. 2003, Gascon et al.\n1 Corresponding author. Email: l.parry@uea.ac.uk\n1999, Vandermeer & Perfecto 1997, but see Dunn\n2004), and they remain poorly studied in the Amazon.\nLarge vertebrates serve important ecological roles in\nthe functioning of tropical ecosystems, especially seed\ndispersal (Howe & Smallwood 1982, Jansen & Zuidema\n2001, Wunderle 1997). In Amazonian and Guianan\nforests, the vast majority of plant species require animals\nfor seed dispersal (Peres & van Roosmalen 2002). The\nvertebrate assemblage within second-growth will there-\nfore influence the rate and nature of forest regeneration.\nAlthough previous research in southern Mexico has re-\nported a reduced species richness and abundance of large\nmammals in secondary forest (Estrada et al.1994), results\nwere confounded by the small size of habitat patches\nand methodological problems such as not accounting\nfor differences in detection distance among habitats\nsurveyed. Indeed other studies have suggested that sec-\nondary forests serve as productive hunting grounds in the\ntropics (Gavin2004,Wilkie1989).Secondary forestsmay\n654 LUKE PARRY, JOS BARLOW, AND CARLOS A. PERES\nFigure 1.Map of the study area within the 1.7-Mha Jari landholding in the north-eastern Brazilian Amazon. Faunal line-transects are indicated in\nhatched areas of secondary forest (S1\u2013S4 unbroken lines) and unshaded areas of primary forest (P1\u2013P4 dotted lines). Stippled areas indicate active\nEucalyptus plantations.\ntherefore support sizeable densities of large vertebrates,\nand may be an important though overlooked large\nvertebrate habitat in fragmented tropical landscapes.\nWe present an investigation of the large-vertebrate\ncommunity structurewithin extensive areas of secondary\nforest in north-eastern Brazilian Amazonia. Comparisons\nare made with adjacent areas of undisturbed primary\n(terra firme) forest. We predict that secondary forests will\nhold high abundances of disturbance-tolerant species,\nwith broad diets which enable consumption of a range\nof fruits and pioneer browse (DeWalt et al. 2003). We\npredict that specialist frugivores will be absent or at\nlow abundance in secondary forest. To our knowledge,\nthis study provides the first quantitative assessment of\nlarge-vertebrate communitieswithinAmazonian second-\ngrowth forests, and should therefore be considered the\nfirst step towards a critical evaluation of the conservation\nvalue of abandoned or fallow agricultural lands for large\nvertebrates in the Amazon.\nMETHODS\nStudy area\nThe study took place in the Rio Jari watershed (0\u25e653\u2032S,\n52\u25e636\u2032W) within the State of Para\u00b4 in the north-eastern\nAmazonbasin (Figure1). The existing1.7-Mha landhold-\ning currently managed by a large forestry company was\noriginally purchased in 1967, with c. 10% (145000ha)\nof the primary forest converted into large-scale exotic tree\nplantations. Currently, the region consists of a mosaic\nof active tree plantations (45000ha), regenerating\nsecondary forest (100000ha), and the remainder largely\nundisturbed terra firme primary forest. The secondary\nforests have naturally regrown after the clearing and\nsubsequent abandonment of 6-y rotationGmelina arborea\nRoxb. and Eucalyptus hybrid (E. grandis\u00d7E. urophylla)\nplantations. Secondary forest patcheswere intersected by\nforestry access roads and some derelict timber-yarding\nareas.Average annual rainfall (1968\u20131986) is 2115mm\n(Coutinho & Pires 1996), with a marked wet season\nfrom January to June, and a distinct dry season from\nSeptember toNovember. Levels of humandisturbance are\ngenerally low within the primary and secondary forests\nof the experimental matrix, and primarily restricted to\nseasonal collection of wild seed crops from Brazil nut\ntrees (Bertholletia excelsa Humb. & Bonpl.). This study\nwas carried out in four areas of even-aged secondary\nforest and four areas of primary forest (Figure 1). The\nsecondary forests were originally cleared with bulldozers\nand were abandoned between 13 and 18 y ago, which is\nalso the typical age of secondary forest from smallholder\nagriculture in the Brazilian Amazon (Smith et al. 2003).\nSecondary forests and large vertebrates 655\nAll fieldwork was conducted between March and July\n2004. One-metre-wide straight-line transects of 3.1 to\n5 km in length (secondary forest transects: 5.0, 4.0, 4.0,\n3.1 km; primary forest: 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0 km) were cut\nat each site prior to surveying. Each transect was in a\ndistinct patch of secondary forest, with a unique history\nof clearance, cultivation and abandonment. Transects\nwere orientated to avoid potentially confounding effects\nof forest edges. Primary and secondary forest patches\nwere large (>1000ha) though we accept that for some\nwide-ranging species such as jaguar (Panthera onca), a\nsingle animal could incorporate primary and secondary\nforest within its home range.\nHabitat data\nTrees and lianas were sampled in two 0.25-ha plots\n(10\u00d7250m) placed alongside each transect from 250\u2013\n500m, and 2250\u20132500m from point zero. The status\n(dead\/alive) was recorded, as were all stumps and tree\nfalls within the plots. All trees (\u226510 cm dbh) with more\nthan half their stem within each plot were recorded.\nForest structure was assessed every 100m along each\ntransect. Height of the canopy was visually estimated to\nthe nearest metre. Understorey density was assessed by\nexamining a vertically held 2.5-m graduated pole from\n15m, using binoculars to count number of 10 cm pole-\nsections clearly visible (following Barlow et al. 2002).\nForest floor cover was assessed using a 2\u00d72-m quadrat\nat the side of the trail. Canopy cover was measured using\na spherical densiometer, following Lemmon (1957).\nEach transect was surveyed for fruit patches in June\n2004, separately from faunal surveys. Terrestrial fruit\ntrail surveys were used as they are both effective and\nefficient to conduct (Sabatier 1985, Wallace & Painter\n2002), and may provide a better measure of mammalian\nfood availability than fruit traps by capturing a greater\ndiversity of fruit types (Hemingway & Overdorrf 1999).\nTerrestrial trails also avoid the chance concentration\neffects that can occur given the relatively small area\nsampled by traps (Stevenson et al. 1998). When a patch\nof fruit was detected on the trail binoculars were used\nto locate and check whether there was still ripe fruit on\nthe parent tree. If there was, the local name, fruit type\n(fleshy or non-fleshy) and dbh of the tree was recorded.\nStem diameter provides a good index of fruit production\n(Leighton & Leighton 1982, Stevenson et al. 1998).\nFaunal surveys\nAll siteswere surveyed for diurnal large-bodiedmammals\nand large easily detectable bird species using a\nstandardized line-transect census protocol as described in\nPeres (1999). Censuses were conducted between April\nand July 2004. Surveys alternated on a daily basis\nbetween primary and secondary forest sites to minimize\nany seasonal bias and maximize temporal independence.\nAll sites were censused six times, providing a cumulative\ncensus effort of 184.3 km. Censuses were undertaken\nin the morning (06h00\u201310h30) but were discontinued\nduring periods of rain. Due to rain, transects could not\nalways be completed though secondary forest effort was\n93.1 km in total (mean=3.9 kmper census) and primary\nforest survey effort of 91.25 km (mean=3.8 km per\ncensus). Transects were walked slowly (1.25 km h\u22121) by\nLP and a highly experienced independent observer. Birds\ncan be effectively surveyed using line transects (Brooks\n& Begazo 2001, Hill et al. 2003, Peres 2000, Peres et al.\n2003), thoughwerestrictedoursurveys torelatively large\nspecies that are easily detectable by sight, call or flush. All\nmedium- to large-bodied mammals and birds (>250 g)\nencounteredwere identified,notingspecies,detectioncue,\ndistance along transect, and perpendicular distance from\nthe transect to the centre of the cluster in the case of\nsocial species. Reliable group size counts were obtained\nwhenever possible. Tracks are a usefulmeans of assessing\nthe relative abundance of terrestrial mammals (Reyna-\nHurtado&Tanner2005)and recent indirect signsof large\nvertebrate activity were also recorded whenever possible,\nincluding tracks, scrapes, faeces and holes in the ground\nused for shelter or foraging. As surveys were conducted\nin the rainy season all soil substrates were constantly\nsaturatedand trackdetectability is likely tobe comparable\nin primary and secondary forest habitat. \u2018Tracks\u2019 were\ndefinedas a cluster of tracks from the sameanimal. Tracks\nof jaguar (Panthera onca) and puma (Puma concolor) were\npooled as they could not always be reliably distinguished.\nIn addition, detection data for several species of small\ntinamous (Crypturellus spp.) and large tinamous (Tinamus\nspp.) were pooled as flushed tinamous were difficult to\nidentify to species during censuses.\nData analysis\nThe number of direct encounters (acoustic or visual)\nwas small for many species so a simple encounter rate\nper 10 km walked was used, rather than calculating\ndensity and biomass estimates. A bias can arise when\ncomparing abundances from line-transect censuses if\nthere are structural differences between study habitats,\nwhich can affect detectability (Johns 1985). As such we\ntruncated the census data of certain species to exclude\nthe greater perpendicular detection distances in primary\nforest (excludedalldatabeyond:Guyananhowlermonkey\nAlouatta macconnelli, 300 m; brown capuchin Cebus\napella, 100 m; Brazilian agouti Dasyprocta leporina, 40 m;\n656 LUKE PARRY, JOS BARLOW, AND CARLOS A. PERES\nred-throated caracara Ibycter americanus, 200 m; white-\nthroated toucan Ramphastos tucanus, 400 m).\nNon-parametricMann\u2013Whitney tests were used to test\nfor differences, unless otherwise stated.\nThe statistical package PRIMER R\u00a9 v.5 (Clarke 1993)\nwas used to explore vertebrate community differences\namong sites. Initially, cross-site similarities were\ncalculated using Bray Curtis as the coefficient for\nfaunal matrices, as it is often used for biological data\n(containing unimodal and linear responses) and ignores\njoint absences. The matrix was constructed using the\nencounter rates of individuals for large vertebrates\nsurveyed, though excluding species observed only once\nin the study (e.g. paca Agouti paca, giant anteater\nMyrmecophaga tridactyla and bushdog Speothos venaticus).\nCross-site similarities were explored visually using non-\nmetric multidimensional ordination (NMDS), in which\nsites are positioned visually in accordance with their\nrelative similarities to each other (Clarke & Warwick\n2001). Analysis of similarity tests (ANOSIM) were then\nperformed (Clarke & Green 1988) to assess whether\nprimaryandsecondary forest sitesdifferedmore fromeach\nother than replicates within the same forest types. A high\nRvalue indicates that replicateswithin site types aremore\nsimilar to each other than replicates from the different site\ntype. Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis was used\nto identify which species contribute to similarities within\ntransects of the same forest type and to dissimilarities\nbetween transects in different forest types (Clarke 1993).\nRESULTS\nHabitat structure and food resources\nSecondary forest was structurally very different to\nprimary forest (Table 1). Secondary forests were\ncharacterized by low basal area, due largely to lower\naverage tree size rather than the only marginally lower\ntree density. Secondary forest canopy was lower and\nmore open. Secondary forest was dominated by a few\ntree families, namely Myrtaceae (which included exotic\nEucalyptus resprouts) andMimosaceae (mainly Inga spp.).\nThe availability of food resources was markedly different\nin primary and secondary forest (Table 1). Secondary\nforest had higher levels of terrestrial browse and a denser\nunderstorey shrub layer. Although the summed basal\narea of fruiting trees was higher in primary forest, the\ndifference was not statistically significant due to some\noverlap between primary and secondary forest sites,\nand the relatively small sample sizes. Fruit walks along\nprimary forest transects yielded 142 patches of fleshy and\n25 non-fleshy fruit, whereas those in secondary forest\nyielded 205 and 3 patches of fleshy and non-fleshy fruit,\nrespectively.

These two\ntree genera alone contributed 42.0% and 46.8% of the\nsummed fruiting basal area, respectively.\nMammals\nMammalian species richness was slightly lower in\nsecondary forests (SF) than in the primary forest\n(PF) controls, although this was not statistically\nsignificant (PF: mean\u00b1 SE=11.5\u00b10.7 species, SF:\nmean=10.5\u00b11.3 species; U4,4 =\u22120.726, P=0.486).\nThe highest mammalian encounter rates were in\nsecondary forest sites, though there was no significant\ndifference between primary and secondary forest\n(U4,4 =\u22120.289, P=0.886).\nThe multivariate patterns of community composition\nwas significantly different for large mammals between\nprimary and secondary forest sites (ANOSIM, R=0.37,\nP<0.05). Nine mammal species were important in dis-\ntinguishing community composition. Of these, primates\nvaried widely in their tolerance of secondary forest and\nwere important discriminators of community composi-\ntion in the SIMPER analysis (Table 2).

For example, Brazilian agouti was\nmore abundant in secondary forest, whereas the opposite\nwas true for red acouchi (Myoprocta exilis). Agouti\ntrack densities were variable across sites (Table 3). The\nsame pattern was found for Mazama spp.; red brocket\ndeer (M. americana) was more abundant in secondary\nforest than primary forest sites whereas grey brocket deer\n(M. gouazoupira)was rare in primary and secondary forest\nsites. Track densities of red brocket deer were also much\nhigher in secondary forest (21.3\u00b18.9 tracks per 10 km\ncompared with 1.8\u00b10.5, respectively, U4,4 =\u22122.31,\nP<0.05). Grey brocket deer track density was similar\nin primary forest and secondary forest. Collared peccary\n(Pecari tajacu) were never observed directly in secondary\nforest though theywere seenorheardon fouroccasions in\nprimary forest. Their tracks were seen in three out of four\nSF and PF sites. There were few direct detection events\nof other ungulates (white-lipped peccaries Tayassu pecari\nand tapirTapirus terrestris) although tracks of both species\nwere seen in both habitats. Tapir tracks were second only\nto red brocket deer in terms of terrestrial mammal track\ndensities. The paca is predominantly nocturnal and was\nencountered only once. However, track data indicated\nthat paca were fairly abundant in secondary forests.\nDirect observations of large carnivores were too rare\nto assess their abundance although tracks were detected\nin both secondary and primary forests (Table 3). In one\nof the secondary forest sites, there was one sighting of\ntwo bush dogs, which are listed in CITES Appendix 1.\nTherewere also sightings of coati (Nasua nasua) and giant\nanteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in secondary forest.\nTracks of armadillo (Dasypus spp.) and giant anteater\nwere recorded in primary and secondary forest, though\nat variable densities.\nBirds\nSpecies richness in secondary forests of the large-\nbodied birds included in our censuses was similar\nto that in primary forest (PF=14.3\u00b10.5 species per\nsite, SF=12.3\u00b11.0 species per site, Mann\u2013Whitney\nU4,4 =\u22121.49,P=0.2).However, theabundanceof large-\nbodied birds was significantly higher in primary forest\nthan in secondary forest (PF=18.5\u00b12.5 encounters per\n10 km, SF=10.2\u00b10.4 encounters per 10 km, Mann\u2013\nWhitneyU4,4 =\u22122.31, P<0.05).\nTable 3.

PERES\nThe community composition of the bird species\nsurveyed was also significantly different between\nprimary and secondary forest sites (ANOSIM, R=0.771,\nP<0.05). Secondary forest sites were characterized by a\nhigh abundance of little chachalaca (Ortalis m. motmot),\nthough also by an absence or much lower abundance of\nnearlyall theotherbirdspeciescensused(Appendix I).The\nlargely terrestrial frugivore-insectivores, grey-winged\ntrumpeter (Psophia c. crepitans) andmarail guan (Penelope\nmarail), were never encountered in secondary forest.\nLarge tinamous were observed in both habitats, though\nwere more abundant in primary forest. Black currasow\n(Crax alector), a large terrestrial game bird, had a higher\nencounter rate in secondary forest, though sample sizes\nwere small. Small tinamous were fairly abundant in\nboth habitats and were not important discriminators\nof differences in primary and secondary forest bird\ncommunities (Appendix 1).\nSIMPER analysis emphasizes the general paucity\nof most canopy birds in secondary forest (Amazona\nspp., white-throated toucan, red-throated caracara, and\npainted parakeet Pyrrhura p. picta; Table 2). Oropendolas\n(Psarocolius spp.) had similar abundances in primary and\nsecondary forest.\nDISCUSSION\nSecondary forestsappear tosupportmammalabundances\ncomparable with those of primary forest, includingmany\nspecies harvested by subsistence hunters in Amazonian\nforests (Peres 2000). We report a high abundance of\nlarge vertebrates in secondary forests (cf. Wilkie 1989),\nindicating a large prey base for both predators and people.\nHowever, community composition was very different\nbetween primary and secondary forest, with high species\nturnover betweenhabitats. Species vary in their resilience\nto changes in habitat and food supply, and tend to\nbe affected by disturbance in different ways (Lawton\net al. 1998). As predicted, primates with a generalist diet\nwere abundant in secondary forests, as were terrestrial\nungulate browsers and agoutis. However, secondary\nforests were probably unsuitable for large primates, and\nheld an impoverished avian frugivore assemblage in\ncomparison to primary forest sites.\nFrugivores\nThe large-scale secondary forests surveyed were a\nrelatively poor habitat for specialist frugivores, and\nthe majority of mammalian and avian frugivores of\nthe Jari region were either absent or rare in secondary\nforests. The complete absence of the largest frugivorous\nAmazonian primate, the black spider monkey, suggests\nan impoverished flora in second-growth areas, as\nwell as structural constraints for these upper canopy\nsemi-brachiators. Spider monkeys feed on large mature\nfruit pulp of primary forest trees and lianas (Peres\n& van Roosmalen 2002, van Roosmalen 1980) and\napparently cannot survive exclusively on small fruits\nfrom pioneer tree and shrub species. The low abundance\nof howler monkeys in secondary forests could perhaps\nbe attributed to a lack of large canopy trees upon which\nthis largely folivorous primate depends (Julliot & Sabatier\n1993,Leighton&Leighton1982,Schwarzkopf&Rylands\n1989).Theresponseof largeprimates reflects theirdecline\nafter logging,which is also attributed to a lack of preferred\nlarge fruiting trees (Grieser-Johns 1997). However,\nabundance of large primates was relatively low even in\nprimary forests at Jari, reflecting the lower regional scale\nproductivity of this region (Phillips et al. 2004, Peres in\npress).\nAlthough highly mobile, large avian frugivores\nresponded in a similar way to large primates. Themarked\nscarcity ofmacaws, parrots and toucans,which specialize\non young seeds or mature fruit, is consistent with the\ngeneral vulnerability of these species to forest disturbance\n(Thiollay 1992). Generalist species, such as the red-\nthroated caracara were present in all secondary forest\nsites, as were small cracids such as little chachalacas.\nLittle chachalacas have been previously recorded as\nhighly tolerant of second-growth habitat, as has Crax\nalector (Borges 1999). Curassows appear to be more\nresilient to habitat disturbance as they were observed in\ntwo of the four secondary forest sites. Oropendolas were\nalso common in secondary forest, possibly because they\nfeed on ripe pods of Inga spp. (Hilty 2003), which are\ngenerally abundant in secondary forests (Guariguata &\nOstertag 2001), including those of Jari. Terrestrial avian\nfrugivores were largely absent from the secondary forests\nstudied, and this is consistent with their responses to\nlogging (Thiollay 1992). Grey-winged trumpeters are\nprimary forest specialists (Stotz et al.1996), and appear to\nbe unable to subsist on food resources in secondary forest\nas they were restricted to primary forest. The absence\nof marail guans from our secondary forest sites may\nbe due to a small sample size as guans have previously\nbeen found to feed on pioneer plants such as Cecropia\nspp. and Bellucia spp. (Borges 1999), but are normally\nless abundant in secondary forest than primary forest\n(Johns 1991a). This raises questions over the degree to\nwhich seed dispersal limitation may hinder secondary\nforest succession. For example, large frugivorous birds\nand mammals almost certainly increase the rate of forest\nsuccessionthroughseeddispersal (Howe1977,Wunderle\n1997), particularly for large-seeded plants dispersed by\na few species of specialized and often large-bodied seed\nvectors (Peres & van Roosmalen 2002, Poulsen et al.\n2002).\nSecondary forests and large vertebrates 659\nDietary breadth\nThe high abundance of several primate species with\nbroad diets (extending to insectivory) in this study can be\nrelated to the resources available in secondary forest, in\nagreement with DeWalt et al. (2003), who predicted that\nprimate biomass in secondary forest will be dominated\nby species that subsist on a mixed diet of fruits and\ninsects. Tamarins are known to prefer secondary forest\nover primary forest habitat (Schwarzkopf & Rylands\n1989), and it has been speculated that they benefit from\nthe abundant arthropods in secondary forest (Lovejoy\net al. 1986). Light-trapping in the same region showed\nhigher Orthoptera abundance per unit volume of forest\nin second-growth than primary forest (A. L. Gutjahr\nunpubl. data). Squirrel monkeys are often abundant in\nhighly degraded forest habitat (Barlow & Peres 2006,\nBoinski 1987), probably due to a broad diet that includes\nmany insects as well as Bellucia and Inga fruits (Lima &\nFerrari 2003). Pioneer trees are associated with high and\nfrequent production of fruit (Levey 1988) and secondary\nforest fruiting in Jari was characterized by an almost\ncomplete dominance of Bellucia and Inga spp. However,\nour study took place just after the peak months of\nfruiting in Jari (Coutinho & Pires 1996) so we may\nhave underestimated fruit production in primary forest\nas compared to secondary forest. The higher abundance\nof brown capuchins in secondary forests was similar to\ntheir density response to logging in central Amazonia\n(Johns 1991b). Their resilience to disturbance may be\ndue to dietary elasticity (Simmen & Sabatier 1996),\nand a tolerance of forest fragmentation and landscape\n\u2018patchiness\u2019 (Michalski & Peres 2005).\nThe occurrence of tapirs in secondary forest is of\nconservation importance given their vulnerability to\nhunting and generally low densities across their range\n(Bodmer & Brooks 1997). Tapirs thrive on herbaceous\nplants and saplings of forest gaps (Fragoso 1991, Salas\n& Fuller 1996), and consume a substantial amount of\nBellucia fruit (Henry et al. 2000), all of which were\ncommon in secondary forests. Red brocket deer also\nsubsistonbrowseandfruits (Gayot etal.2004),explaining\ntheir high abundance in secondary forests. Grey brocket\ndeer are more frugivorous than red brocket deer, and\nconsumea lowerproportionofbrowseandpioneer species\n(Gayot et al. 2004).\nAlthough hunting can severely impact vertebrate\nassemblage structure (Peres 2000), our findings are\nunlikely to have been affected by differential levels of\nhunting pressure in primary and secondary forest as\nour survey sites were deliberately remote from human\ncommunities. Participatory mapping with hunters in the\nregionalso indicates that theareas surveyedare subjected\nto only low levels of hunting pressure (L. Parry unpubl.\ndata).\nConservation implications\nThepaceof landconversion in tropical forest regions looks\nset to continue (Foody et al. 2003) and an increasing\nproportion of tropical forest cover will become second-\ngrowth (Wright & Muller-Landau 2006). It is therefore\nessential to understand the value of secondary forest\nto large vertebrates, firstly to determine which species\nare absent from secondary forest due to a low tolerance\nto regrowth habitat. Secondly, the case for preventing\nindiscriminate re-clearance of regenerating forests is\nstronger given some baseline abundance data. This study\ngoes some way to redress a chronic lack of information\nregarding large vertebrate community composition\nwithin secondary forest (Dunn 2004), although longer-\nterm studies examining inter- and intra-annual changes\nin vertebrate abundances are essential to gain a full\nappreciation of the conservation relevance of this habitat.\nFurther researchcouldalsoclarify theextent towhichsec-\nondary forests may serve as feeding rather than breeding\nareas, as has been suggested for birds (Petit et al. 1999).\nThe high abundance of many bird and mammal\nspecies insecondary forestwarrantsgreaterconsideration\nby landowners when planning conversion of existing\nsecond-growth forests into agriculture, or increasingly,\nexotic tree plantations (Malhi et al. 2002). However, the\nlower suitability of second-growth habitat to many spe-\ncialist bird and mammal species means that 13\u201318-y-old\nsecondary forests are of limited conservation value com-\npared with primary forest. Conservationists are encour-\naged toargue for theprotectionofexisting tropical second-\nary forests as a useful resource for nature conservation,\nrather than as an adequate alternative to primary forests.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful for the help of Jari Celulose S.A.,\nwho kindly hosted our work.
