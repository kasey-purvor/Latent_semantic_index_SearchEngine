Apocalyptic pronouncements about the ways in \nwhich MTV-style television, films and the internet are devaluing chastity and destroying \n\u2018genuine\u2019 Indian culture by promoting western sexual values abound in journalistic and \npolitical circles. But what are the realities of young people\u2019s encounters with media in a \nthriving Indian metropolis? How do they make sense of all the vastly different images of \nsexuality embodied in community\/religious edicts and modern media? And how are their \ninterpretations of all these supposed \u2018messages\u2019 played out in their everyday lives? \nEmerging from a three-year study of youth audiences, involving numerous in-depth \npersonal interviews with young Hindi film viewers in London and Bombay, this article \nexplores the ways in which these young people\u2019s sexual attitudes, values and behaviours \nare inflected by their interpretations of films, television and the internet. By focusing on \nunderstandings of and relationships to sex and love \u2013 both mediated and real \u2013 within the \n \n1\ncontext of statements about accepted community norms, formal and informal sex-education, \nand personal sexual practices, this article also engages with ideas and myths about \nrepresentations of women that have dominated recent debates on sex, censorship and the \nmedia in India.  \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe interpretations and discourses of dress and sexual harassment, gender and sexuality to \nbe foregrounded in this article do not exist within a hermetically sealed space exclusive to \nviewers and the media texts they experience. Instead, they circulate within communities, \nand are inflected variously in many salient social practices. Comments made by young \nBombay film-goers during interviews suggest strongly that female attire, \u2018virginity\u2019, sexual \nexploration and sexual violence remain issues of key significance both in life and films1. In \nBombay, the onus for remaining chaste is almost uniformly placed upon girls and women, \nwhile young men are known to engage, covertly, in a multitude of exploratory sexual \npractices and, sometimes, sexual violence without attracting much or any public censure. \nHowever, excitement and\/or anxiety about sexual feelings and encounters appear to be \nshared features of young viewers\u2019 talk. A number of academic studies in recent years have \nsought to map attitudes to aspects of community practice with regard to gender and sexual \nrelationships amongst youth in India (Abraham, 1999, 2002; Sodhi and Verma, 2000). \nLeena Abraham\u2019s work on the health implications of heterosexual peer networks and \nrelationships amongst college students in Bombay offers some pertinent background for the \nheterosexual relationships and representations discussed here.  \n \n2\n \nThe disparity in sexual experience between young men and women in Bombay, Abraham \nargues, is linked in some way to the \u2018normative heterosexuality\u2019 prevalent in Hindi films. \nShe then points to the prescriptive nature of the \u2018true love\u2019 relationship as portrayed in \nHindi films \u2018where it revolves around sexual desires, fantasies that are explicitly erotic at \ntimes, but stops short of transgressing the normative boundary of sexual intercourse\u2019 (2002,  \np347). Sodhi and Verma, meanwhile, conclude their paper on \u2018sexual coercion\u2019 among \nunmarried adolescents in a Delhi slum with the finding that \u2018[c]inema plays a role in \nperpetuating gender stereotypes, by encouraging girls to idealise the notion of \u201ctrue love\u201d \nand encouraging boys to seek sexual gratification\u2019 (2000, p93). So, is it the case that the \ndepictions of romance and sexuality in Hindi films always contribute to conservative \nunderstandings of sex and sexuality within the viewing community? What other factors \nmight contribute to the meanings young viewers make of film representations of sexual \nbehaviour? And just how do film representations of masculinity and femininity become \nmeaningful for young viewers in real contexts? These are some of the questions with which \nthis article aims to grapple. \n \n \nFraming the study \n \nThe data explored here was gathered over a period of two and half years \u2013 September 2000 \nto March 2003 \u2013 and involved in-depth interviews with and extensive notes on the home \nlives, social environment and popular film experiences of 36 London South-Asian and \n \n3\nBombay Hindi film viewers aged between 16 and 25. Additionally, I was a participant \nobserver inside and outside over 80 Hindi film showings across both sprawling \nmetropolises, conducting brief interviews with a hundred viewers, keeping a detailed field-\ndiary and taking hundreds of photographs at cinema halls. Concurrently, I analysed Hindi \nfilms, articles about Hindi films and stars from popular film magazines, newspapers and the \ninternet, and reviewed all the current literature on Hindi cinema, including much on \nethnicity, gender, sexuality, clothing and film audiences. From the data collected I wove \ntogether a \u2018narrative\u2019 \u2013 of which this article forms one brief but significant segment \u2013 about \nthe manner in which on and off-screen family, marriage, romance, dress, sex and sexuality \nare understood by a sample of young viewers and the manner in which gender, religion and \nnotions of tradition come to shape responses to what may be termed films\u2019 political \ndiscourses.  \n \nIn selecting a sample, the knowledge that research subjects never speak from \u2018ideal \nrepresentative positions\u2019 informed the explicit choice to include and acknowledge as many \nmajor variables as possible, notably, sexuality, gender, religion and class. I contacted \nrespondents through students\u2019 unions, teachers, friendship-groups, or family, via work \ncolleagues or neighbours, by posting notices in local libraries, chemists, clinics and corner \nshops as well as on the internet-movie-database and other Hindi movie bulletin-boards, and \nvia several youth outreach organisations. The sample of films proved trickier: interviewees \nrarely stuck to the \u2018blockbusters\u2019 I intended to use and sometimes referenced films I\u2019d \nnever heard of; overall, however, a number of \u2018big\u2019 films did emerge as central to Bombay \nviewers\u2019 narratives on sexuality, romance and dress: the romantic hits Dilwale Dulhaniya \n \n4\nLe Jayenge (DDLJ, 1995, The One with the Heart Takes the Bride) and Raja Hindustani \n(1996, Indian King) were two of these. Symbolic and social discourses on \u2018dress\u2019 in \u2018India\u2019 \nare crucial to the courtship and marital relations in Raja Hindustani, while notions of an \n\u2018authentic Indian\u2019 sexuality for both male and female protagonists are delineated by various \nsequences in DDLJ, particularly one where the heroine wakes \u2013 with a hangover after an \nunexpectedly passionate excursion \u2013 to panic at the thought of having had sex with the \nhero. \n \nDuring individual interviews, young people themselves volunteered all manner of detailed, \nfascinating and frank information about their lives and beliefs, behaviours and desires. In \nterms of the manner in which I conducted in-depth interviews, the notion of \u2018active \ninterviewing\u2019 drawn from Holstein and Gubrium (1998) provided me with a measure of \nflexibility in terms of my ability to respond to, comment on or contest interviewees\u2019 \nassumptions about a variety of sensitive topics from sexual harassment and rape to ethnic \ncleansing. They argue persuasively that: \n \nRather than searching for the best or most authentic answer, the aim is to systematically \nactivate applicable ways of knowing \u2013 the possible answers \u2013 that respondents can \nreveal, as diverse and contradictory as they might be. The active interviewer sets the \ngeneral parameters for responses, constraining as well as provoking answers that are \ngermane to the researcher\u2019s interest. (Holstein and Gubrium, 1998, p125) \n \n \n5\nLess controversially, the structure of interviews was loose enough to enable viewers to \npursue ideas that concerned or interested them. Initial questions usually aimed to establish \nsubjects\u2019 favourite films, genres or viewing companions, to \u2018break the ice\u2019, while later ones \naimed to elaborate and unpick assertions about specific sequences or to pursue tricky \nassertions about gender, sex and ethnicity.  \n \nShow and sell: young viewers read clothing in Hindi films \n \nDiscourses around clothing were invoked by interviewees in conjunction with issues as \ndiverse as sexual fantasy, financial status, religion, an apparent deterioration of moral \nvalues, and sexual harassment. One of the most common strands in discussions about dress \nand sexuality on screen was an appeal to \u2018direct effects\u2019 as grounds for censorship of film \ncostumes. After commenting that an actress, Urmila Matondkar, \u2018must be hardly needing \nany material for her dresses\u2019, Gautham2, an unmarried clerk living with his parents in a \nBombay suburb, worries that after watching performances by this actress on screen young \nwomen and girls will feel pressured into wearing things that they neither enjoy not feel \ncomfortable in. Although implicitly he is averse to the wearing of \u2018revealing\u2019 clothes by \ngirls and women, he poses the issue in terms of younger women falling prey to male \npredations: \n \nI\u2019ve seen the younger generation of girls in schools and colleges wearing these kinds of \nthings, netted cloth stockings and mini skirts \u2026 I feel that this is dangerous in the sense \nthat the kids might be more of a target for eve-teasing and India might go the western \n \n6\nway with more child pregnancies; I feel that dress plays a part in this\u2026 They have no \nself-defence experience. [English3] \n \nIt is important to recognise that, despite his conflation of the \u2018western way\u2019, \u2018child \npregnancies\u2019 and a need for \u2018self-defence experience\u2019, Gautham\u2019s wording expresses \nconcern about the safety of young women wearing \u2018filmy\u2019 or \u2018western\u2019 clothes and does not \nposition him as offended by their choice of dress. Nevertheless, Gautham\u2019s avowed concern \ncould be seen as a displaced form of disapprobation and as an expression of the commonly \nemphasised opinion that sexual attacks and women\u2019s clothing are directly linked to each \nother.  \n \nLest this be taken as a feature only of male viewers\u2019 talk, it must be noted that several \nfemale viewers in my sample held this view. Although she \u2018loves\u2019 to wear jeans and T-\nshirts, Neha, a married 23-year-old, too articulates her beliefs about on and off-screen dress \nvia notions of \u2018westernisation\u2019 and endangerment stating firstly that \u2018girls should avoid \nvery less clothing kind of dress because it is spoiling the whole of what Indian culture is \n[which is] to cover yourself\u2019 and secondly that men have \u2018a tendency to get attracted and \nthat is what is now leading to the crime what you see in foreign countries like because they \nare wearing all short skirts and that is what is leading to the rape cases\u2019.  \n \nIn contrast, in an almost dialogic rebuttal of Neha\u2019s and Gautham\u2019s assumption that a \nwoman is endangered or may be protected by the type of clothing she wears because men\u2019s \nthoughts are aroused or dampened by more or less revealing dress, working-class, 21-year-\n \n7\nold, Sonali maintains that \u2018[e]ven if you go around totally veiled from top to toe the men \nwill whistle and make comments.\u2019 This leads her to assert angrily, \u2018[s]o why not show \nheroines in short clothes? It\u2019s female [pause] that\u2019s all the men care about [pause]. I cover \nup totally and still get all kinds of things said\u2019. Kavita, a student, too expresses her belief \nthat \u2018whatever you are wearing, even if you are fully covered, boys will pass comments and \nworse stuff\u2019. Thus practical experiences of sexual harassment off-screen enable a number \nof viewers to challenge dominant discourses about clothing, \u2018Indianness\u2019, safety and \nchastity that may appear to be shared by Hindi film directors and some members of their \naudiences.  \n \nSonali\u2019s reiteration of the idea that self-censorship in dress achieves nothing in a milieu \nwhere being female is coded as being sexual prey leads her to make connections between \nHindi film dress and gender ideology. In contrast to Gautham, who only mentions the more \nrevealing aspects of actresses\u2019 attire, Sonali is infuriated by the ways in which films show \nwomen covering themselves up. \n \nSonali: [I]n villages [pause] women are totally traditional, in sarees and veiled. They are \nabused if they don\u2019t and given a warning about \u2018shameless\u2019 behaviour. \nSB: In your view, are the films you watch against or for \u2026household veiling? \nSonali: Well, [angry voice] the really big blockbusters are totally in favour of veiling like \nthat, wearing the saree over the head in front of elders and male relatives. Like Hum \nAapke Hain Koun\u2026!, Hum Saath Saath Hain [pause] these are really famous and \ninfluential. [Hindi] \n \n8\n \nSonali\u2019s scorn is directed at big budget films that, to her, assert hegemonic or dominant \npatriarchal discourses about the ways in which \u2018Indian\u2019 women should conduct themselves \nwhen in the presence of elders or strangers and, as a corollary, any spectators.  \n \nExpected \u2018feminine\u2019 behaviours are, as usual, inscribed in clothing, which is itself an \nexpression of cultural practice and may be an expression of cultural control (Thapan, 1997, \np173). Challenging those who would maintain this control, Preeta, in Bombay, not only \nadmitted that she enjoyed wearing \u2018western\u2019 clothing but said that she did so precisely \nbecause of what she saw as the transgressive, alluring, sexual and \u2018come hither\u2019 \nassociations that they have acquired via their use in Hindi films. Her open enjoyment of \nmale attention and her pride in her own body was, she asserted, better gratified by tight T-\nshirts, fitting jeans, and low-cut tops than by the salwar khameezes she routinely wore to \nthe Gurudwara for prayers. \u2018It looks very sexy. That\u2019s why I\u2019m wearing it right now\u2019 she \ntold me, pointing to her frilly sleeveless top and tight stretch pants. Preeta\u2019s participation, \nwithout fear, in a discourse of desire, arousal, pursuit and sexuality \u2013 through an \niconography of clothing in which films, unknown \u2018others\u2019 and her own body are actively \nengaged \u2013 cannot but complicate a view of \u2018western\u2019 attire on the Hindi film screen as \nfunctioning in a system of erotic meaning that is entirely for the pleasure of male viewers. \nIn fact, I suggest, whatever may apparently be said in public contexts, and regardless of the \nfilm-makers\u2019 dubious motives for rendering such representations for public consumption, it \nis too simplistic to think of most female viewers as offended by or even always averse to \nstereotypically \u2018sexualised\u2019 depictions of women\u2019s bodies in Hindi films. \n \n9\n \nJasmine, however, clearly linked sexual harassment in a film to the clothing worn by a \nheroine: \n[S]he seems like a useless, helpless object, waiting to be rescued. So we see huge \ngroups in long shots. We see close ups showing the fear in her eyes. Karishma in Raja \nHindustani when she wears \u2018that\u2019 red dress. [English] \n \nThe sequence referred to by Jasmine in this extract, which depicts the negative response of \na young villager when the educated and city-bred woman he loves appears in public in his \nsmall town wearing a sexy red dress instead of the obligatory salwar-kurta, is one about \nwhich I have written in greater detail elsewhere (Banaji, 2002).  \n \nINSERT FIGURES 1 AND 2 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe fact that the heroine is then harassed by a group of local hooligans precipitates the \ngentle hero into an unexpected and shocking show of violence, purportedly in defence of \nher \u2018honour\u2019. Jasmine\u2019s rendering of the scene has clothing being used as a triple pretext: \nfirstly for men in the film to pick on the woman, secondly for the not so subtle warning to \nyoung women about what wearing such dresses might do to them and thirdly, for the hero \nto rescue the heroine.  Several of the young male viewers I interviewed were keen to \ndifferentiate between clothing appropriate to a \u2018good wife\u2019 and that which might be worn at \nother times to excite the interest of men.  \n \n \n10\nIn one notable instance, a viewer maintained that the hero of Raja Hindustani was \u2018old-\nfashioned\u2019 not because he disapproved of the short dress worn by his sweetheart but \nbecause he made no distinction between the types of clothing permissible before and after \nmarriage. Enthusiastic about every type of western\/modern outfit found on a female \ncharacter on screen, Azhar opened the subject by asserting that he \u2018really\u2019 enjoyed seeing \neverything, \u2018Jeans, dresses, minis and micros\u2019. When I indicated that he should elaborate, \nhe told the \u2018story\u2019 of his wife\u2019s altering costumes and his altered perception of her: \n \nAzhar: [D]uring our college days, I dressed her in all those dresses, tight clothes, I told \nher I like it very much. In college I made her wear model dresses. While we were \ntogether. Whatever she wanted to wear. Even she felt uncomfortable wearing things \nsometimes and say she preferred salwar kameez and I\u2019d tell her \u2018please go on, when you \nlook so horny in it, and it\u2019s worn by actresses and models, go on\u2019. To me I felt she should \nwear hipsters, sleeveless T-shirts. Even she began to like to wear those clothes. \nSB: Does she still wear such clothes after marrying you? \nAzhar: Of course not! How would she? She wears salwar khameez \u2026 Before she was \nmy girlfriend. Now she\u2019s my wife. There\u2019s a massive difference!  \nSB: Like in films\u2013 \nAzhar: \u2013See, in some films, like in Raja Hindustani, the guy doesn\u2019t like such clothes on \nthe heroine even before marriage. He\u2019s old-fashioned. But I liked her to look like that \nand wear those things when she was my girlfriend. See, how I feel is, I wanted her to \nlook \u2018modern\u2019 [English] when she was my girlfriend [\u2026] Before I didn\u2019t care if men said \nthings about her. [laughs] But now if they say things about her then it is an insult to me. I \n \n11\nfeel bad, you\u2019re getting my point? I don\u2019t want all that, I don\u2019t want to be insulted \nbecause of how she dresses\u2026I don\u2019t want her to expose her body. She never wants it \neither. I convinced her it was necessary for her to give up all those sorts of clothes like \njeans. [Hindi] \n   \nAzhar\u2019s multiple and casual sexist comments in this exchange \u2013 from \u2018I dressed her\u2019, \u2018I \nmade her wear\u2019 to \u2018[b]efore I didn\u2019t care if men said things about her\u2019 \u2013 would be almost \ncomic, were they not so alarmingly similar to those I heard or heard of in numerous \nother interviews with both young male and female viewers.  \n \nDebates around dress in Hindi films have most frequently centred round themes of nudity \nand\/or exposure. Arguments that are either anti-western in their gist or feminist in their \nintent have coincided in condemning the Indian media in general and Hindi cinema in \nparticular for portrayals of women in tight-fitting, short, low-cut or transparent attire \n(Bagchi, 1996; Gahlot, 2003; Nair, 2002, p53). My intention here is not to deny the strength \nof negative feeling that on-screen female exposure calls forth within the Indian populace \nand the intelligentsia, nor, necessarily, to label all such feeling either mere prudishness or \nanti-western rhetoric. I simply wish to signal that in their own talk about clothing and \nnudity, \u2018exposure\u2019 and \u2018covering up\u2019 young people go beyond the parameters set up by \nmost existing debates. Implicitly, by coding nudity and overt bodily exposure as \u2018sexual\u2019, \nfully clothed bodies may be relegated to an asexual realm that they, in truth, do not inhabit. \nBoth campaigners against scantily dressed representations of women and, perhaps, some \n \n12\nfilmmakers themselves, may well be missing crucial aspects of audiences\u2019 enjoyment of \nHindi films and of human sexuality.  \n \nMight it not be the case that, in some instances, the bodies of women and girls displayed in \nlatex and lycra, swimming costumes, rent blouses, mini-skirts and sheer fabrics become or \nare, to sections of the public, less sexual than images of women in flowing sarees and pure \nwhite salwar khameezes with high collars and full sleeves?  \n \nIn relation to Jane Campion\u2019s film, The Piano, Stella Bruzzi argues that \u2018superficially \nrestrictive clothes function as equivocal signifiers, acting both as barriers to sexual \nexpression and as the very means of reaching sexual fulfilment\u2019 (Bruzzi, 1997, p38). Both \nJasmine and Gautham demonstrate an awareness of the ways in which the highly \nchoreographed censorship of female nudity \u2013 the tacit Hindi film industry requirement that \nwomen remain clothed, albeit scantily, at all times and that no \u2018explicit\u2019 sexual acts be \ndisplayed \u2013 could be used not to dampen but to increase the erotic potential of specific \nscenes and the lust of swathes of the anticipated audience. As Gautham explains: \n \nActually what Hindi films do is they entice you more than English films. Like, \nactually, you might find Madhuri Dixit much more sexual in the rain or a bathing \nscene than an English [Hollywood] actress like Jennifer [Lopez] who strips off \ncompletely. In English films they don\u2019t leave anything to the imagination, whereas in \nHindi films the common man [including me] can go wild in his imagination\u2026 I like \n \n13\nKajol mostly because her nature is lively like mine. I might fantasise with her [pause] \nwith her body, so it\u2019s good they don\u2019t show the whole thing. [pause] [English] \n \nSeveral issues arise from Gautham\u2019s assertions. Firstly, in the light of his claim that he \nprefers the covertly eroticised heroines in Hindi films to the overt nudity of heroines in \nHollywood films, accounts of Hindi film and censorship, such as that given by Lalitha \nGopalan (1998) in her essay \u2018Coitus Interruptus and Love Story in Indian Cinema\u2019 \u2013 where \nshe argues that directors are not as unhappy as has sometimes been made out with the \nvarious dictates of the censor board precisely because the \u2018public\u2019 has learnt to gain a \ndifferent kind of pleasure from suggestions and allusive sexual representations \u2013 become \nmore plausible.  \n \nSecondly, to view Gautham\u2019s \u2018use\u2019 of Hindi films merely as pornographic and hence \ndemeaning to the female characters in films \u2013 part of the construction of a men\u2019s culture of \n\u2018dirty talk\u2019 and \u2018dirty thoughts\u2019 about women that makes even urban India such a difficult \nplace to live on terms of equality with men4 \u2013 is too simplistic. Although one point of such \nscenes may be precisely to provoke the sexual and potentially sexist and \u2018objectifying\u20195 \nresponse Gautham described \u2013 or a similar one \u2013 such interludes and representations, which \ninvite viewers into a spectacle where clothing, suggested nudity and transferred kissing (the \nkissing of objects, hands, necks and abdomens instead of lips), provide much needed \n\u2018fantasy\u2019 space (Kakar, 1990, p27) for segments of the audience such as adolescents or \nyoung women. One young lesbian viewer, Abhi, from a working-class family, told me that \nshe uses reactions during discussions about actresses\u2019 bodies (breasts, hips and thighs) to \n \n14\ngauge whether her friends might be open to hearing about her sexuality. Two young male \nviewers talked of their pleasure in male bodies on screen, their romantic identification with \nheroines and their crushes on leading actors.  \nThirdly, it is also worth recollecting that even such fantasy spaces are not seen as \nwholesome or legitimate in a social setting that denies \u2018common people\u2019 the right to have \nsexual fantasies outside of marriage and that, in addition, refuses the time and the \nopportunity for such fantasies to many women, even if they are married (Thapan, 1997, \np186). Such awareness may lead one to understand more clearly the reasons why, even \nwhen the audiences may not deny their pleasure in a film\u2019s erotic moments, the directors \ncloud the issues of sex and sexuality by disavowing the sexual undercurrents in their films \nvia the use of dance sequences, ultra-conservative dialogues and patriarchal\/conformist \nalterations in character.   \n \nINSERT FIGURES 3 AND 4 HERE \n \n \nWhose pleasure? The enjoyable objectification of bodies on screen \n \nCommenting on what she sees as the chameleon ability of the commercial Hindi film to \ngratify desires that it appears to condemn, Asha Kasbekar argues that once it has \n\u2018established its moral credentials\u2019 and \u2018sworn its allegiance to the official, idealised version \nof Indian womanhood, the Hindi film then dedicates itself to soliciting the prurient gaze by \noffering \u2026 the woman as an erotic object in the song and dance sequences\u2019 (2001, p294). \n \n15\nShe later insists that, \u2018by declaring it to be only make-believe, a pretence, the strategy of \n\u201cperformance\u201d, allows the narrative to reconcile the woman\u2019s idealized chaste Sita-image \nwith her erotic invitations\u2019 (2001, p298). Despite plausible analyses such as these, that offer \nexplanations for the balancing act between exhibitionism and prudery in Hindi films, for \nme, there are several problematic aspects to the most widely held critical positions on \nspectatorship and Hindi cinema. These centre around the implicit suggestions that female \nviewers\u2019 pleasures in Hindi films are a) monolithic, b) likely to be compromised by the \neroticisation or sexualisation (which is viewed implicitly as a form of objectification)6 of \nfemale bodies on screen and c) can be safeguarded only via the stratagems of moralistic \ndisavowal, spectacular materialism and the reassertion of authoritarian and patriarchal but \nnon-sexual \u2018roles\u2019 for women within the narrative.  \n \nWith regards to such objections, at one level, data from my sample suggests that at least \noutside the immediate and public viewing context of a cinema hall both male and female \nviewers hold a variety of psychological positions and understand images, dialogues and \nnarratives in a range of different ways. Thus while not necessarily radical or \u2018politically \ncorrect\u2019, the meanings taken away from Hindi film representations of the body and the \npleasures provoked by these representations are certainly not monolithic for either male or \nfemale viewers, although the publicly manifested responses may appear to be. At another \nlevel, some female viewers may well object to the depictions of female bodies on screen: I \nmyself have done so on several occasions. However, surely the idea that a woman on \nscreen is more \u2018objectified\u2019 when she wiggles her hips and has her cleavage zoomed in on \nby the camera than when she serves a man his food or covers her head chastely in front of \n \n16\nher in-laws is ludicrous. Nevertheless, the word \u2018objectification\u2019 does not crop up in critical \ncommentaries nearly as frequently in connection to head-covering or cooking by women in \nfilms as it does in relation to wet scenes and scanty clothing.  \nEven Jasmine, who comes closest to a position typical of the Indian feminist movement in \nthe nineteen-eighties and nineties7, moves from explicit condemnations of the vulgarity and \nsexism that she sees as inherent in screen portrayals of semi-clothed women \u2013 \u2018It is very \npatriarchal and sexist\u2019 \u2013 to a more light-hearted enthusiasm for the provocative, sexual \nallurement available to her and her female friends:  \n \nI can\u2019t deny that the portrayal of a man\u2019s body often turns me on, especially when \naccompanied by music. I am not shy about this attraction either. I wouldn\u2019t use the word \n\u2018turn-on\u2019 in front of my parents but I have often \u2018oohed\u2019 and \u2018aahed\u2019. I remember how \nHrithik\u2019s portrayal in the dance sequences absolutely floored me in Kaho Na Pyar Hai.  \nAfter watching this, my friends were discussing how his biceps should be transplanted to \nhis bum! [English] \n \nAt one level, Jasmine\u2019s movement from condemnation of \u2018objectification\u2019 to empathy with \nsuch objectification is characteristic of a number of discussions of sexual issues by young \nHindi film viewers and indicates both the shifts and reassessments taking place during an \ninterview and the tendency of confident young viewers to condemn others for doing what \nthey are proud of doing themselves. At another level, her assertion that she was \u2018absolutely \nfloored\u2019 suggests a palpable and confident sexuality. \n \n \n17\nRahul, a 21-year-old metal worker in Bombay, was open about his discontent with current \nsocial practice and rhetoric on sex and sexual depictions: \n \nRahul: I think somehow that Hindi films indirectly do want to show sex, they do, they \ngo almost the whole way and then pull back for fear of public opinion or censors, like the \nkiss in Raja Hindustani and other scenes. But in real life, the public is miles ahead of the \nmovies in terms of sex. They\u2019re doing everything that the films aren\u2019t showing yet, \nbelieve me! There is media where you can see it. Come on, there are so many sex \nchannels that people can secretly or privately watch. There is the page three in mid-day, \nthe \u2018mid-day mate\u2019. Some people say in public, \u2018Dirt! What rubbish!\u2019 but alone they \nexclaim, \u2018Wah! Wah!\u2019 [Wow!] People never want to be seen thinking about sex. I do \nwant to read proper sex books but they are hardly available. So we rely on gossip and on \nthe advice of friends. My friends call me a coward because I haven\u2019t had it [sex] yet. \nSB: How do you feel about a girl who has had sex before marriage? \nRahul: Look, I don\u2019t want her to feel that she has fallen in her own eyes. That\u2019s it.  \nSB: So you sympathise with Kajol in DDLJ during the hotel scene8 a sequence in which \nthe hero pretends to have had sex with the heroine when she was under the influence of \nalcohol? \nRahul: She was lucky. Any other boy would not have let her go. Most probably. He\u2019d \nthink, come on, she\u2019s come into my hands. There might be boys who think she\u2019s drunk \nlet\u2019s leave her alone. But I know many who would get her drunk and do anything for sex. \n\u2026 In reality today amongst both men and women there are those who want to take \n \n18\nsomething from each other like a contract, a fulfilling of needs, which does not require \nmarriage. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that if it\u2019s equal. But is it, often?  I \nhave friends, girls, who have been having sex with their boyfriends, they\u2019ve even had \nabortions, and I wonder why they\u2019re doing it, is it worth it? Other male friends of mine \nsimply wait for young married women who are dissatisfied with their arranged \nmarriages, with their husbands. Our society is simply so hypocritical. Nothing will ever \ncome out in the open \u2013 on the surface it\u2019ll be white. Underneath it will be something else. \nSB: So, how do the films you like fit into this society? \nRahul: See, these films separate out romance and sex. For sex there are the blue \nchannels. For romance we have the Hindi films. We can\u2019t watch a blue scene with our \nsister-in-law and mother, can we? [sarcastic voice] Something would have to give, we\u2019d \nhave to get up and leave the room; otherwise they\u2019d get the wrong impression about us. \n[sarcastic voice] [Hindi]  \n \nRahul\u2019s interpretations, conjectures and observations about film viewing and sexual \npractices in Bombay, while possibly intended to impress me, and those to whom the \nresearch would be presented, are nonetheless confirmed or slightly amended, time and \nagain, in public literature about the topics discussed and in other interviews with young \nviewers.  \n \nMost of the young viewers I interviewed were both aware of, and frequently participants in, \na range of intimate non-platonic relationships where varying degrees of physical and sexual \nintimacy and, on occasion, violence or psychological coercion, were the norm. Nikhil was \n \n19\nopen about the fact that before his arranged marriage he had had a sexual relationship with \nan older woman whom he \u2018admired\u2019. Several young female viewers, while understandably \nreluctant to discuss their sexual exploits on tape, were engaged in highly physical \nrelationships with boyfriends. And, as if such accounts are not enough to confirm Rahul\u2019s \nsense of the immensely intricate situation in real communities of viewers in Bombay, right \nat the end of her two hour interview, Preeta gave a slightly sheepish but candid description \nof her own encounters with pornographic material.  \nSB: So how have you found out about issues to do with sex and sexuality? \nPreeta: Movies. Blue movies.  \nSB: What did you think of them? \nPreeta: Wonderful. It was wonderful. It was the first time I saw it. And you\u2019ve seen on \nthe net? \u2026We go in Cyber cafes. It\u2019s very productive out there. [laughs] I just go with \none of my friends, the Muslim girl I told you about. We look at only sex sites. [S: Only \nthose sites!] Yeah. I have got to know so many things about that [sex]. [long pause] \nActually I never knew before about how to have sexual intercourse. But watching a \n[blue] movie I just came to know about all these things.  \nSB: Do your friends also use such films to learn about sexuality and sex? \nPreeta: Yeah, maybe. Sometimes they laugh a lot and sometimes they feel shy too. I\u2019m \nthe leader of the group. We go at our friends\u2019 places, we just [rent] the cassettes [\u2026] \nSB: What kinds of films? \n \n20\nPreeta: [laughing] I don\u2019t exactly remember it now but Triple X and things like that. At \nleast eight of my friends have seen these movies with me. I would say\u2026.Some of the \nscenes make us laugh so much, you know. But at times we just be serious, and we watch \nit like that [sitting forward and showing me how they stare at the screen], we watch it to \nsee what happens.  \nSB: I\u2019m getting the impression that for some of you sex is completely separate and \nromance is completely separate. \nPreeta: Ya, it is. In life it comes together. But in films \u2013 no. [English & Hindi] \n \nIn the viewing trajectory that Preeta describes, \u2018blue\u2019 movies and internet sex sites play an \nequally important role, apparently introducing not only Preeta \u2013 who is herself from a \nconservative lower-middle-class family \u2013 but also her Muslim best friend, and up to eight \nother female friends of theirs, to various images of sexual intercourse that they, according \nto Preeta, have not considered before and have not encountered in Hindi films.  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nOverall, an equal number of young men and women in my sample, springing equally from \ndifferent religious and class contexts, dwelt at length and with sustained interest on the \nromantic narratives and the sexual undercurrents of a range of Hindi films. In this context, \nPreeta\u2019s description of watching her first commercial pornographic film as \u2018Wonderful \u2013 it \n \n21\nwas wonderful\u2019 must serve as a caution that generalisations, which categorise all male \nviewers of Hindi films as more focused on sex and the erotic than their female counterparts \nwho, perhaps, are seen to await the moral subtexts or the romance in films, do little justice \nto the complexities of viewing communities or (South Asian male and female) relationships \nand desire. Clearly, then, while depictions of romance and sexuality in Hindi films may \ninvite a limited range of interpretations they call forth a much wider range of responses \nand engagements from young viewers. Indeed, social circumstances (which include \nexperiences of sex, pornography and\/or romance) and political views always inflect \nmeanings made from film representations of love and the body. \n \nThe notion that Indian women viewers, more than their male counterparts, require \u2018treats\u2019 \nin the form of emotional dialogues, fashionable clothing or moral retribution to compensate \nthem for the sequences in which screen bodies are \u2018sexualised\u2019 and displayed supposedly \nfor men\u2019s pleasure9 does not sit comfortably with testimony by viewers in my sample. In at \nleast half of my interviews more fierce and forceful objections were raised to the sequences \nin which women were represented as being foolish, servile, docile and obedient \u2013 all \nsupposedly the moral window-dressing allowing women\u2019s continued engagement with \nthese films \u2013 than to those in which men and women danced suggestively or in which \nwomen\u2019s bodies were glimpsed through their clothes. In fact, despite frequent comments \nsuggesting a consensus that film-makers may cynically attempt to appeal to groups of male \nviewers by displaying actresses\u2019 bodies in flimsy garments, in a number of cases, \ninterviewees of both genders chose to dwell at length on their own enjoyment of dances, \nclothing and bodies on screen.  \n \n22\n \nDefining \u2018objectification\u2019 in terms of female nudity\/sexualised representation misses the \npoint about how viewers choose to respond to the invitations of films. It also begs the \nquestion about which representations are not \u2018objectifying\u2019. Clearly, one must \nacknowledge, the criteria for labelling a representation chauvinist are not bound up solely \nwith the perception of that representation by the represented group. However, calls for \nfewer and more sanitised depictions of the body on screen pre-empt learning and debate \nand reduce viewers\u2019 fantasy space. It is worthwhile remembering that while the knowledge \nthat in India \u2018the common man\u2019 is going \u2018wild in his imagination\u2019 thinking of curvaceous \nheroines under waterfalls may not necessarily fill some of us with a sense of ease and \nsecurity, the possibility that \u2018the common woman\u2019 might also be doing the same thing \nabout representations of either male or female bodies must surely give one pause for \nthought and signal the importance of avoiding simplistic calls for censorship in debates \nover \u2018acceptable\u2019 and \u2018unacceptable\u2019 screen representations.  \n \nNotes \n \n                                                 \n1 This was indicated by detailed thematic mapping of 500 pages of transcript from the first 30 of 36 \ninterviews. However, this is in not an indication of how widespread these views are across youth in \nthe population at large; and data in this article is not \u2018representative\u2019 of anything more than a partial \nsnapshot of young Bombayites\u2019 views on films and sexuality. \n2 Pseudonyms are used throughout to guarantee confidentiality and to reflect the regional and \nreligious self-descriptions of interviewees. \n3 In addition to being an indicator of class or class aspiration in Bombay, the parenthesized \nnotations of language acknowledge translations or, within excerpts, sudden changes in language.  \n4 The view that depictions of women as \u2018sex objects\u2019 on screen and the responses these \nrepresentations provoke in men is directly linked to the harassment of women on the streets is \ncommonly held by lay people and critics alike in India. \n \n23\n                                                                                                                                                     \n5 The question which springs foremost to mind is whether all sexual desire is not to some extent \ninevitably \u2018objectifying\u2019 and, if it is, then what objectification actually means in each of its contexts \nof use. For instance, can any look be construed as \u2018sexual\u2019 and hence objectifying? Or, are certain \ntypes of look designated thus in order to pathologise the \u2018looking\u2019 done by \u2018others\u2019? \n6 Kathy Myers argues that \u2018There is a sense in which sight and perception necessarily entail \nobjectification in order to conceptualise and give meaning to the object of our gaze\u2019 (1995, p267). \nFurthermore, she insists, \u2018we have to clarify whether it is the process of necessary objectification \nentailed in perception which we object to \u2026 or the meaning it carries for women under specific \npatriarchal formations \u2026.\u2019 \n7 See Shohini Ghosh (1999) on censorship and the feminist movement; also Mary E.
