The potential for \nmutually complementary linkages between the two are clear, in theory at least: partnership, as \ndefined here, should produce, nurture and enhance levels of interpersonal trust inside \norganisations, while in turn trust, as defined here, legitimates and helps reinforce an \norganisation\u2019s \u2018partnership\u2019. Qualitative evidence drawn from the self-reports of key participants \nin three unionised partnership organisations provides some support for the claimed linkages.

It is also the policy recommendation of choice for \nrelevant think tanks (the Royal Society of Arts, 1994; Fabian Society, 1996; Industrial Society, \n2001), as well as ACAS (1999). Even the CBI and the CIPD have cautiously welcomed it, with \nqualifications. Despite this widespread approval of the idea, very few genuine examples have \nbeen identified.1 \n  \nIn almost all case studies of partnership, trust is a constant and \u201cdefining\u201d presence (cf. the Cave \n& Coats quote above). Trust has been cited as a necessary pre-condition of partnership; as the \nprocess through which partnership is realised; as one of its most important outcomes, and as the \nmain method for monitoring progress and constraining \u2018anti-partnership\u2019 actions. However, \ndespite Guest and Peccei indicating a fruitful research agenda in examining \u201cthe role of trust in \neffective partnership at work\u2026 to identify the processes that must be in place for high trust to \nemerge\u201d (2001: 232; see too Sparrow and Marchington, 1998: 311), trust has not hitherto formed \nthe core of any research or academic analysis of partnership.  \n \nThe article is divided into five sections. The following section presents a nuanced definition of \nthe \u201ccentral, superficially obvious but essentially complex\u201d idea of trust (Blois, 1999). The \nsecond section proposes a complementary definition of partnership, based on the requirements \nfor developing trust. The third section sets out the potential linkages between the two. Three case \nstudies follow, presented according to Heaton, Mason and Morgan\u2019s triadic structure: partnership \ndevelopment, implementation, and the involvement of the key players (2002: 113). The findings \nand conclusions offer an exploratory examination of the two concepts as they relate to each \nother, and in particular what partnership can and cannot do to improve workplace relations \nthrough developing trust. \n \nTrust. \nTrust is understood usually as a belief comprising the deliberate intention to render oneself \nvulnerable to another based on confident positive expectations (see Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, \n1995; Rousseau et al, 1998; Lewicki, McAllister & Bies, 1998). This definition requires a \nnumber of clarifying statements.  \n \nFirst, all parties in a trusting relationship are subject to a level of risk, although the distribution of \nrisk may be disproportionate among the parties. This risk is derived directly from accepting the \n                                                          \n1 Robert Taylor (2003) has suggested that there are only 80 known cases that conform to the TUC\u2019s definition of \npartnership. The DTI\u2019s dedicated website (http:\/\/www.partnership-at-work.com) has 95 separate case studies, \nthough not all comply strictly with the definition presented here. The government\u2019s Partnership Fund, set up to offer \nfinancial support to partnership initiatives, has subsidised around 160 schemes so far (October 2003). \n \n 2\n   \npossibility of harmful consequences arising from the actions of the other parties, including their \nnon-compliance with, defection against, or withdrawal from any agreements reached in the \nrelationship. The mutual dependence and shared vulnerability inherent in trust distinguish it from \nother forms of securing co-operation, such as coercion. Second, because the decision to trust is \nbased on expectations, or \u201cprobabilities\u201d (Gambetta, 1988), trust carries a crucial \u201cstrength of \nfeeling\u201d (Bhattacharya et al, 1998: 462) that elevates it above mere hopefulness, blind faith or \ngullibility (see McEvily et al, 2003: 99). This important quality protects trust from three \ncriticisms: that it is \u201cunreflective\u201d (Garfinkel\u2019s claim, cited in Lane, 1998: 11), irrational \n(Williamson, 1993) or a form of \u2018false consciousness\u2019. Properly understood, it is none of these. \nTrust is a desired state, \u201can attractive option\u201d (Gambetta, 1988: 219; Blois, 1999: 204). Third, for \nthese expectations to be credible they should be based on a careful evaluation of the other party\u2019s \nlikely future behaviour, ideally from evidence drawn from several prior interactions and in a \nrange of settings (Whitener et al, 1998: 515), although reputational effects and the advice of \nrespected intermediaries can be other sources (see Meyerson et al, 1996). Fourth, this evaluation \nneeds to assess the other party\u2019s benevolence, integrity, competence and predictability \n(Cunningham & McGregor, 2000: 1578-9) but it can be \u201ccompartmentalised and aggregated\u201d \n(Lewicki, McAllister and Bies, 1998) such that parties, if they wish, may accommodate \ncontradictions and errors, if they still judge the quality of the other party\u2019s trustworthiness \noverall to be sufficient.  \n \nIt follows that trust is not a simple \u2018either\/or\u2019 matter, and nor do categories such as \u201cconditional\u201d \nand \u201cunconditional\u201d (Jones & George, 1998) or \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cweak\u201d (Barney & Hansen, 1994) \ncapture its subtleties of degree. In the literature there are five such degrees, derived from \ndifferent sources and reflecting different levels of intensity. These can be placed along a \ncontinuum (Figure 1):  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 HERE. \n \nDeterrence-based trust (Rousseau et al, 1998) does not comply with the definition above; rather, \nit is a manifestation of distrust. There is no positive expectation of goodwill whatsoever, and \ncompliance is guaranteed, rather than hoped for, through the threat of sanctions and force. The \nweakest form of trust is calculus-based (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996: 119) which, as the name \nsuggests, considers trust a worthwhile strategy only on the basis of a strict cost-benefit analysis. \nA deep a priori suspicion of the other remains, but trusting them is a marginally better tactic than \nnot trusting them. Between this and knowledge-based trust (Lewicki & Bunker, ibid: 121) a \nthreshold is crossed when suspicions recede to be replaced by positive expectations based on \nconfident knowledge about the other party. Real trust begins here. If expectations are vindicated \nby experience, more powerful forms of trust may develop. The confidence in relational-based \ntrust (Rousseau et al, 1998: 399) is more subjective, even emotional in nature. Blois \ndistinguishes between trust derived from the other party\u2019s \u201cdependable goodwill\u201d and trust based \nonly on their reliable habits (1999: 200). Similarly, Creed and Miles (1996) see the source of \ntrust shift from \u2018process-based\u2019 evidence provided by the content of exchanges between the \nparties, to an appraisal of the trustee\u2019s \u2018characteristics\u2019: their personal qualities and motives. As \nsuch, relational-based trust can tolerate minor \u2018defections\u2019 and mistakes as uncharacteristic \naberrations. Lastly, the overwhelming affection and complete unity of purpose described in \nidentification-based trust (Lewicki & Bunker, ibid: 122) is such that each party can represent the \nother\u2019s interests with their full confidence. Use was made of these five degrees of trust in the \ncase study interviews (see methodology).  \n \nWhitener and colleagues describe five categories of behaviour for individuals seeking to \ndemonstrate trustworthiness (1998: 516-518): \n 3\n   \n1. Behavioural consistency - reliability and hence predictability. \n2. Behavioural integrity - telling the truth and keeping promises. \n3. Sharing and delegation of control - shared input into decision-making. (This falls somewhat \nshort of what a European audience might understand by \u2018shared control\u2019.)  \n4. Communication - open sharing of accurate, timely, contextualised information  \n5. Demonstration of concern - showing sensitivity toward each party\u2019s needs and interests, and \nacting benevolently.  \n \nAny model for workplace relations purporting to promote and develop trust would be expected \nto feature policies designed to encourage and reward these behaviours.  \n \nA definition of partnership. \nAs with trust, there is conceptual confusion on what is meant by workplace partnership (for a \nreview see Ackers & Payne, 1998). There is still no agreed definition (Guest & Peccei, 2001: \n208; Haynes & Allen, 2001: 166; Terry, 2003: 463), and little guidance on how we might \nrecognise a genuine example.  \n \nCentral to almost all conceptualisations is some notion of \u201creciprocity\u201d (Martinez-Lucio & \nStuart, 2002: 308) or \u201cconnotations of co-operation for mutual gain\u201d (Tailby & Winchester, \n2000: 374). These are rather vague \u2013 perhaps necessarily so, given the \u201cinherent ambiguity\u201d of \nthe idea of partnership (Bacon & Storey, 2000: 409) \u2013 and one person\u2019s co-operation can be \nanother\u2019s co-optation (Kelly, 1996; Claydon, 1998). A useful definition should therefore \ndescribe a set of organisational characteristics and practices that, firstly, do justice to the idea of \nmanaging employment relations in a \u2018partnership\u2019 manner and, secondly, are readily observable \nin order to verify a genuine example in practice. Two definitions, from the Involvement and \nParticipation Association (IPA, 1992, 1997) and the TUC (1999: 13), offer this (Figure 2).  \n \nINSERT FIGURE 2 HERE. \n \nBoth definitions are very similar in content, although some elements are interpreted differently \n(discussed below). The key point of departure between the two is that, under the IPA\u2019s \ndefinition, the partnership exists primarily between an employer\u2019s management team and its \nworkforce, with the latter represented by a trade union if present. As such, it allows for non-\nunionised forms of partnership. Despite unions\u2019 understandable protestations, such forms can \nand do exist, although they are very rare indeed.2 \n \nThe IPA\u2019s three \u2018commitments\u2019 and the TUC\u2019s six \u2018principles\u2019 are envisaged as firmly-held \nconvictions about the nature of the employment relationship and how it is best managed. They \nprovide coherence to the organisation\u2019s HR strategy and should inform the design, \nimplementation and monitoring of partnership practice at all times and in all areas. They should \nalso be widely publicised. (The commitment to develop trust is not an explicit feature of the \nTUC model, but is implicit under \u2018Recognising legitimate interests\u2019.) \n \nThe central process of partnership is continuous joint problem solving throughout the \norganisation, alongside open and timely exchange of honest and accurate information \u201claterally, \nupwards and downwards\u201d (IPA, 1997: 11). The precise structure and content of this is not \n                                                          \n2 Non-unionised partnerships include the John Lewis Partnership, Pentagram, Scott Bader Commonwealth, \nSportasia, St Lukes\u2019 Communications and Tullis Russell, all of which are employee-owned. I know of only six \nexamples of non-employee-owned, non-unionised partnership firms: Appor, Black & Decker, Dutton Engineering, \nOldrid Group, Trifast, and Zotefoams \u2013 although more must presumably exist. (Details on each of these are \navailable at http:\/\/www.partnership-at-work.com.) \n 4\n   \nprescribed, but in both models it is expected to involve a mix of direct and indirect forms \u2013 as \nappropriate to the organisation. (The TUC model is, understandably, rather less keen on direct \nforms, and views them only as an agenda-setting prelude to formal union\/employer discussions.) \nThe vital quality is that employee groups be able to influence significantly the decision-making \nfrom what has been called the \u2018glint-in-the-eye\u2019 stage of planning (TUC, 1999), up to and \nincluding its outcomes. Employees and their representatives are not understood to be mere \n\u201cadvisers to management\u201d (Heery, 2002) or managers\u2019 fellow change agents (Terry, 2003: 466). \nIndeed, one proxy measure for a mutually beneficial partnership might hinge on employees\u2019 \n\u201cability to oppose management proposals\u201d (Oxenbridge & Brown, 2002: 275). In Marchington \nand Wilkinson\u2019s \u2018escalator\u2019 of five types of employee involvement (2000: 343), partnership\u2019s \njoint problem solving most resembles at minimum \u2018consultation\u2019, and in more advanced forms, \n\u2018co-determination\u2019. Certainly, it demands more than weak \u2018communication\u2019 and \u2018information\u2019 \nmechanisms, but employee \u2018control\u2019 over decision-making is highly unlikely. With these \nexacting standards partnership is more likely to be observed in unionised representative forms \n(Guest & Peccei, 2001). But Knell (1999) found negligible differences between his non-\nunionised and unionised case studies, and IRS researchers have even suggested that non-union \nforms are often \u201cmore developed and deeper-rooted\u201d (2000: 39).  \n \nTwo main policy outcomes are produced. The first is common to both models: a \u201cbalance \nbetween employment security and flexibility\u201d. What constitutes flexibility is left to the partners \nto define; it will of course vary from organisation to organisation. Employment security is not a \n\u2018job-for-life\u2019 promise, but \u201ca stable employment framework\u201d (IPA, 1997: 2) provided through a \nmulti-year pay deal and\/or a no-compulsory redundancy guarantee, complemented with careful \njoint management of unavoidable job losses. With this distinction in mind, one need not express \nsurprise, as Hall did (cited in Munro & Rainbird, 2000: 226) when large-scale redundancies take \nplace under partnership. The issue is how they are agreed upon and handled. Training to enhance \nstaff \u2018employability\u2019 also plays a part.  \n \nThe second policy outcome in the IPA model is \u2018sharing organisational success\u2019. This \nincorporates not just good basic pay and participation in reward schemes, such as employee \nshare ownership, profit-sharing or gain-sharing bonuses, but organisation-wide celebrations of \nimproved performance, staff perks and days out, and harmonised terms and conditions. \nCuriously, under the TUC model the explicit benefits to employees from engaging in partnership \nare somewhat narrowly confined to a \u201cfocus on the quality of working life\u201d and \u201cpersonal \ndevelopment\u201d (TUC, 1999: 13). The matter of financial reward is not addressed.   \n \nThese prescriptions are malleable enough to allow for several viable interpretations, but \nsufficiently specific about minimum quality standards for any policies and practices to ensure \nthat they are both credible and observable. A genuine partnership organisation should have \npolicies and practices addressing each element. To have only the principles without the practices \nis to have merely produced a mission statement; to have only the practices but no overarching \nprinciples is to leave the practices floundering for want of direction, and vulnerable to \nabandonment. To have no multi-level joint problem solving fails to differentiate partnership from \npassive compliance to managerial diktat, a \u201csham\u201d empowerment initiative, or paternalism, while \nto have only joint problem solving but no exchange of mutual benefits or, more importantly, a \ncommitment to improving relationships, fails to distinguish partnership from collective \nnegotiations in general. Lastly, to be considered a partnership organisation, the programme \nshould be accorded some degree of embedded permanence, rather than be a temporary, \ncalculative tactic of co-operation over one or a handful of workplace matters (cf. Munro & \nRainbird, 2000; ACAS case studies, 1999).  \n \n 5\n   \nThe above notwithstanding, what is clear in advocates\u2019 conceptualisations and from participants\u2019 \naccounts is that the terms of any agreement or an organisation\u2019s policies are secondary to the \ninternal behavioural transformations and attitudinal improvements that the programme demands \nin what Geary and Roche call the \u201corganisational micro-politics\u201d (2003: 33). In Boxall and \nPurcell\u2019s truism, \u201cstructure does not equate with process\u201d (2003: 171). Trust is considered \ncentral to this process (Coupar & Stevens, 1998: 145; Haynes & Allen, 2001: 181; Arrowsmith, \n2002).  \n \nPartnership and the development of trust - theory. \nPartnership would seem \u2013 in theory, at least \u2013 to fulfil the five pre-requisites for trustworthy \nbehaviour (Whitener et al, 1998). The joint commitment to, and shared pursuit of, success \nencourages \u2018behavioural consistency\u2019 in line with this objective - even if what constitutes \n\u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cjoint commitment\u201d might be subject to a useful clarifying discussion among the \npartners. Recognising the legitimate role and interests of each partner offers some protection \nagainst vulnerability by constraining parties\u2019 opportunism and promoting \u2018behavioural integrity\u2019, \nas well as \u2018demonstrating concern\u2019. The IPA\u2019s \u2018commitment\u2019 to building trust speaks for itself. \nWhile adherence to publicly declared commitments and promises should become a matter of \n\u2018integrity\u2019 and \u2018demonstration of concern\u2019, and Gambetta endorses the \u201cfundamental importance \nof long-term arrangements\u201d (1988: 230), suspicion remains that such commitments can be rather \ncosmetic. The means through which each is translated into policy and practice is more important.  \n \nPartnership-style joint problem solving and open information sharing satisfies the requirements \nfor \u2018communication\u2019 and \u2018sharing and delegation of control\u2019, with the aforementioned caveat \nattached on what Whitener and colleagues mean by \u2018control\u2019. Allowing for greater shared input \ninto decisions reflects managers\u2019 trust in employees and a willingness to be trusted in return. The \nprocess provides the means for exploring a common agenda around which trust can be built, \nwhile the joint approach helps diminish the sense of vulnerability and fear of opportunism that \npostpones parties\u2019 \u2018leap of faith\u2019 into trust. In particular, it helps employees render the factors \naffecting their working lives subject to some influence. Regular interactions over a mutually \nagreed agenda not only facilitate the crucial appraisal of the others\u2019 trustworthiness, but \nappreciation of different agendas and ideas can promote shared understanding, even empathy. \nRegular interaction also allows for monitoring each party\u2019s adherence to the partnership. \nConducted in accordance with partnership-style principles, which demand \u2018integrity\u2019 and \n\u2018consistency\u2019 and resemble Walton and McKersie\u2019s integrative bargaining (1965: 131-148), this \nprocess must inevitably enhance trust - as, indeed, Kessler and Purcell found in their study of \njoint working parties (1996: 675).   \n \nPartnership\u2019s policy outcomes offer a mutually beneficial agenda around which parties can build \ntrust. Balancing employment security with flexibility and productivity for mutual success \nemphasises a shared, prosperous, long-term future. Achieving the balance moreover \ndemonstrates the viability of beneficial reciprocity and encourages the leap of faith into trust \nfrom all parties. Securing these two \u2018wins\u2019 for the future offsets the impact of any immediate \n\u2018losses\u2019, such as redundancies or increased workloads for employees, and partial surrender of \nprerogative for managers. Similarly, sharing success keeps the relationship positive through the \nexchange of mutual benefits, vindicating the trust. Both policy outcomes also help answer the \n\u2018what\u2019s in it for us?\u2019 cry from sceptics on both sides. The parallels with Whitener and \ncolleagues\u2019 \u2018demonstration of concern\u2019 are obvious. More generally, these mutual gains \nexchanges correspond closely with Axelrod\u2019s optimal strategy for developing co-operation: \nreward beneficial behaviour, punish defections (1984). \n \n 6\n   \nThe links are thus apparent in theory. In practice, we would expect to find in a fully-functioning \npartnership organisation consistently favourable viewpoints on the process from most, if not all, \nparticipants; an unambiguous shift toward the most positive degrees of trust, and significantly \nreduced reports of conflict and antagonism. We would also expect participants to cite the \npartnership programme, or elements thereof, as decisive influences on any shifts in trust. \nConversely, in a partial or weakly supported partnership we would expect little change, reports \nof enduring conflicts, weaker degrees of trust and less cohesion in participants\u2019 accounts. The \ncase studies explore these assumptions.  \n \nCase studies: methodology and limitations. \nThe research took the form of qualitative, interview-based case studies inside three unionised \norganisations recognised as having a full and functioning IPA-style partnership.3 Between 20 \nand 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted in each organisation, the final number being \nsubject to the availability of suitable interviewees. Additional material was sourced from \ncompany documents, conference presentations, and media reports. Each organisation was visited \ntwice to avoid a one-off \u2018snap-shot\u2019 of impressions and to benefit from participants having more \ntime for reflection. (This is surely a methodological pre-requisite for a phenomenon as \nincremental as partnership.) Interviewees included the Managing Director or equivalent, HR \nmanagers and HR officers, all union convenors, several shop stewards and non-HR senior and \nline managers, plus a small sample of non-key players from the \u2018shop floor\u2019.4 I was given access \nto known sceptics. The multiple interviewees are a strength of the method, both in terms of \ngiving voice to different organisational constituencies at all levels and in corroborating accounts \nof what happened. However, there are some gaps, most notably among the 18 trade unions \nrecognised by the \u2018NHS Trust\u2019 and among the senior managers in the manufacturing firms\u2019 \nparent companies.  \n \nInterviews were conducted on a one-to-one basis and lasted between 35 minutes to 2 hours, \ndepending on how much the person had to say on partnership. All were tape-recorded. Open-\nended questions solicited a narrative account of the partnership, seeking in particular to account \nfor any attitudinal and behavioural shifts among the participants. Further questioning engaged \nthe interviewee in a discussion on what (s)he understood partnership to mean in theory, and in \npractice inside their organisation. The interviews for the second visit tended to be with the key \nplayers. They were shown short definitions of the five degrees of trust (Appendix 2), and were \nasked to reflect on which best described relations in the organisation at key stages of the progress \ntoward and beyond partnership. This proved highly illustrative, but was not without its \nmethodological limitations. The complex terminology of the five degrees was not, in retrospect, \nan ideal instrument. (The wording was designed to retain the nuances of the different degrees.) \nHowever, all but two of the 18 second-round interviewees were able to make use of them and \nmost offered careful and cogent responses. Many of the insights into trust also came from \nresponses to other questions. It is also difficult in a semi-structured interview to isolate the \nimpact of partnership on trust from other contributory factors, including the individual\u2019s innate \npre-disposition to trust, for example. There are also the familiar problems surrounding \nsubjectivity with the key players\u2019 testimonies, especially of interviewees projecting their \nexperiences onto the organisation as a whole and post-hoc reflections being subject to error and \nbias, especially those which present the interviewee in a favourable light. Efforts to triangulate \nthe data and to corroborate testimonies have reduced the impact of these problems. One further \n                                                          \n3 I should declare an interest here. During this research I worked part-time in a self-employed capacity for the IPA as \ntheir Research Manager.  \n \n4 A list of interviewees is provided in Appendix 1. \n \n 7\n   \npreventative measure undertaken was to ask the key contact in each organisation (an HR \nmanager) to approve for accuracy the narrative section presented here.  \n \nSpace restrictions confine the case studies to only a brief narrative focussing on the salient points \npertaining to partnership and trust, to the inevitable neglect of both detail and other important \nissues in the partnership debate. Gaps are unavoidable. As with any case study, the findings \nshould be read as extrapolated inferences based on carefully corroborated testimonies, rather \nthan \u2018facts\u2019 as such. \n \nCase study 1: Allied Distillers (ADL).5 \nADL is the flagship subsidiary of the British multi-national Allied Domecq. At the time of the \nstudy it employed 1,200 across 19 sites in Scotland, plus a gin distillery in south London. It \nrecognises the GMB (production: 100% density), AEEU (engineers: 100%) and MSF (staff \ngrades: 40%). Pre-partnership, ADL\u2019s industrial relations was adversarial, with most \ninterviewees reporting \u201cno trust whatsoever\u201d. Change was \u2018bought\u2019 by wage increases, passed \nonto loyal consumers through price increases. The catalyst for partnership came in the mid-\n1990s when Allied Domecq conducted a benchmarking exercise. It revealed ADL to be among \nthe least efficient companies in the sector, but with the best-paid staff. A veiled threat to ADL\u2019s \nfuture sparked moves toward reform. Various attempts to introduce a \u2018partnership\u2019, including the \nSTAR initiative (described by Marks et al, 1998: 216), were hindered by an inconsistent \napproach from managers, deemed more \u201cna\u00efve\u201d than scheming. Premature calls for joint problem \nsolving were not well served by a reluctance to share information about business plans, and few \nsignificant exchanges of mutual benefit. In 1995, the company brought in a new cadre of \nyounger managers, but their first approach to the still suspicious unions to engage in joint \n\u2018brainstorming\u2019 on ADL\u2019s future also floundered. As one shop steward said, \u201cYou\u2019re being too \nsophisticated for us. This is \u2018HR\u2019, and we\u2019re used to \u2018IR\u2019\u201d [i.e. industrial relations]. The Marks et \nal account covers the story only up to this point (1998: 217), hence their assessment of ADL\u2019s \npartnership as weak and unconvincing.  \n \nADL\u2019s partnership agreement was eventually agreed at the fourth attempt. Following a \npresentation to the entire workforce by the MD explaining exactly the changes required, \nmanagers from HR and production were \u2018locked\u2019 into a hotel for three weeks of single-table \nnegotiations with the three unions. The first week consisted of efforts to \u201cbreak the ice\u201d, to move \nbeyond the traditional posturing of ADL\u2019s combative industrial relations and find common \nground. The blunt, \u2018no-nonsense\u2019 manner of the main company negotiator appealed to the unions \nmore than the pseudo-collaborative \u2018HR\u2019 methods tried previously. The managers shared openly \nconfidential business information and their strategic plans. The breakthrough came early with \ntwo significant \u2018joint wins\u2019: employment security in exchange for new flexible working \npractices, and a guarantee that there would be \u201cno losers\u201d financially. These demonstrated the \nviability of the partnership approach. Also, the intensity of the \u2018sealed\u2019 venue increased \nparticipants\u2019 familiarity with each other, and spurred efforts to get the deal finalised. The unions \nfelt that they had \u201cquite a lot\u201d of influence on the final decision-making [AEEU convenor]. \n \nThe agreement, \u2018Change Agenda\u2019, was eventually approved in late 1996 after a costly and \nlengthy joint selling of its terms to a highly sceptical workforce. Alongside several statements of \npartnership principles, it exchanged a guarantee of no redundancies for the deal\u2019s three-year \nlifespan (beyond the 221 voluntary job losses specified in the deal) in return for the workforce\u2019s \ncommitment to multi-skilling, the collapse of 32 pay grades into four and the abolition of all \ndemarcations. As part of a skills-linked salary review, everyone\u2019s pay went up and a series of \n                                                          \n5 The interviews for this study took place in July 2000, four years after the signing of ADL\u2019s partnership agreement. \nFollow-up interviews took place in July 2001. \n 8\n   \nbonuses were staggered over the three years. (ADL also runs an employee share ownership \nscheme.) The agreement inaugurated several consultation forums, including a dedicated \npartnership steering group and joint working parties to involve shop floor employees in \nimproving ADL\u2019s productivity. The agreement was rewarded with \u00a320m of capital investment in \na new all-in-one facility that \u201cnever would have been authorised\u201d otherwise [then HR Director]. \nThe deal has since been re-negotiated and ratified twice more, extending the employment \nsecurity guarantee each time.  \n \nThe joint problem solving worked well until 2001, when key signatories on both sides left ADL, \ntaking much of the impetus for partnership with them. Inter-union animosities also resurfaced, \ndismantling the partnership\u2019s single-table arrangements. Finally, an incursion by management \ninto employees\u2019 cherished customs and practice on managing their own break times - ironically \nsecured as part of the \u2018Change Agenda\u2019 deal - nearly undid the hard-won trust, almost taking the \npartnership down with it. In the second-round interviews, all interviewees described the \npartnership as still intact, but less secure than before.  \n \nTracking the key players\u2019 assessments of the quality of trust during this five-year process, most \nselected deterrence-based trust to describe the \u201cbleak\u201d pre-partnership period. During the \n\u2018Change Agenda\u2019 talks, and the joint campaign to sell the deal, trust among the key players \nsoared to relational-based and even identification-based levels. Union interviewees were less \nkeen to emphasise this harmony of purpose. Each key player conceded however that trust was far \ngreater among themselves than between the \u2018workforce\u2019 and the \u2018company\u2019. Even five years on, \nthe partnership ethos had yet to percolate throughout ADL. Reflecting on this, the then HR \nDirector conceded: \u201cIn reality, what you\u2019ve done with partnership is convince a finite group of \npeople to work with you\u201d. But, he felt, \u201cit\u2019s bound to be that way in a large business\u201d because \ntrust comes from extensive experience of an individual, which non-key players are not privy to. \n\u201cPartnerships tend to get built on personalities\u201d, felt one union convenor. The HR manager felt \nthat it \u201creally shouldn\u2019t make a difference [if the original \u2018architects\u2019 leave] if the process is \nbedded down and you use the [partnership] systems\u201d. But, he argued, participants need to keep \nfocussed on sustaining the application of partnership principles, lest either \u201centrenchment from a \nlack of understanding\u201d or \u201cshort-termism: winning the battles but losing the war\u201d start to \ncontaminate relations. The then HR Director expanded:  \n\u201cYou cannot expect groups to take partnership beyond their own interests\u2026 There is a \n\u2018greater good\u2019 programme, but there\u2019s a limit to it, and points beyond which the unions \ncannot go\u2026 If the company oversteps \u2018reasonableness\u2019 then it de-legitimises the \npartnership and it breaks down.\u201d  \n \nHe declined to speculate on where these parameters might fall, but condemned managers\u2019 \ntransgressions as \u201cmadness\u201d. However, a manager enmeshed in the dispute over break times \npresented the dilemma in the form of a question: \u201cIs making difficult decisions seen by \nemployees as a break in trust?\u201d The incident suggests that it is and therein lies the rub (discussed \nin the conclusion).6  \n \n                                                          \n6 The \u2018breaks issue\u2019 was resolved the following year as part of the 2002 annual negotiations with the trade unions.  \nThe talks themselves were very protracted and at one stage saw two one-day stoppages by the engineers\u2019 union. But \nthey eventually culminated in two very close votes (from the AEEU and GMB separately) in favour of accepting the \ndeal. It featured as key elements the introduction of \u201824\/7 working\u2019, a reduction in contractual working hours to 36 \nhours (a first for the industry), the creation of nearly 200 new permanent jobs, control of working hours in \nanticipation of future European legislation (including a reduction in overtime), and a \u2018breaks\u2019 system which \nreflected ADL\u2019s aspirations toward World Class Manufacturing standards (telephone conversation with HR \nDirector, October 2003). \n 9\n   \nThe ADL case shows what partnership can achieve in a hostile environment in terms of \nimproved industrial relations and productivity. But it also suggests strongly that maintaining \npartnership-minded relations relies upon the strength of character, commitment and abilities of \nthe key players. Moreover, the resilience of these relationships can be tested sorely by the \nimplications of competitive pressures. \n \nCase study 2: BorgWarner Torq Transfers (BWTT).7 \nBWTT is a single-site auto components firm, the UK subsidiary of a U.S. corporation. In 2001 it \nemployed 200 people, down from a peak of 1,700 thirty years previously. In the 1970s the \nmilitant engineering unions \u201cran the plant. We would oppose anything from managers \u2013 no \nquestioning of the members, no reasoning, just opposition\u201d [then shop steward]. The first move \ntoward partnership came in 1983 when a catastrophic downturn in the industry threatened the \nplant\u2019s future. Joint problem solving, reluctantly entered into by the unions but encouraged by \ngreatly increased information sharing about the business, produced an \u201castonishing\u201d six-year pay \ndeal (Bassett, 1986: 98-99) in exchange for workforce commitment to \u201ctechnical ability, \nflexibility and trust-based industrial relations\u201d [then convenor]. Though it was not called a \npartnership, it resembled one in both content and process. The patchily introduced flexibility \nsaved the plant and improved performance. But a joint venture failed in 1993 and the 220 \nunavoidable job losses amounted to over half the workforce. Worse, 18 had to be compulsory, \nrequiring the sole union (AEEU) to abandon its \u2018last-in-first-out\u2019 principle. This time joint \nproblem solving began well in advance. The union was shown BWTT\u2019s \u2018books\u2019 and worked on \nthe plans to stave off closure. This helped them convince the enraged workforce that \nmanagement was not lying, and that the reforms could work. In the end, the workforce accepted \nthe \u2018Hobson\u2019s choice\u2019 of a deal by a margin of four-to-one. In response, the MD offered an \nabove-inflation pay offer and no compulsory redundancies for two years. Both sides committed \nto formal joint problem solving to try to prevent further catastrophes, and to cement the \nimproved industrial relations.  \n \n1997\u2019s partnership agreement, \u2018The Margam Way\u2019, emerged from these talks. All the key \nplayers noted its switch in tone and emphasis away from prescriptive substantive terms toward \nwhat an ex-convenor called a more \u201cconceptual\u201d agreement revolving around notions of trust \nand teamwork. In fact, the text is dominated by substantive detail, so these comments would \nseem to elevate the process aspects above the more tangible outcomes. Alongside the three \npartnership commitments, including one to \u201cprogressive employee relations\u201d, the deal confirmed \na jointly designed, fair and generous redundancy management policy (employment security \nbeing an unattainable promise) alongside a commitment to flexible work practices. Union-\nmanagement problem solving now extends to all matters pertaining to the plant, and the \u2018open-\nbook\u2019 policy on information shares every detail on costs, sales, performance and profits with the \nworkforce. The union can even send BWTT\u2019s financial books to their own officials for scrutiny; \nthey have never felt the need to do so. Team structures and continuous improvement practices \nengage employees in improving production. Pay continues to be subject to collective bargaining \nbut whereas it was once a protracted and antagonistic affair, it \u201cnow takes half an hour and fits \ninto our teamwork philosophy\u201d. According to the convenor, his members\u2019 salaries and terms and \nconditions are \u201csecond to none\u201d for the area, with additional gainsharing bonuses for hitting \nagreed performance targets. The substantive terms of the agreement have been amended and \n                                                          \n \n7 The interviews for this study took place in August 2000, four years after the signing of BWTT\u2019s partnership \nagreement although, arguably, seventeen years after the first move toward partnership. Follow-up interviews took \nplace in July 2001. \n \n 10\n   \nendorsed by the workforce each year since, despite regular small-scale rounds of redundancies, \nincluding 30 in 2001.  \n \nAppraising shifts in trust over the course of BWTT\u2019s partnership based on key players\u2019 \ntestimonies, the 1993 crisis meant that formal partnership talks began from a position of \ndeterrence-based, or at best, calculus-based trust. Trust improved cautiously during the design of \n1997\u2019s partnership to knowledge-based trust, attributed to the greatly increased information \nsharing and a collective siege mentality. By 2001 relations had stabilised into a solid relational-\nbased trust for almost all the key players, facilitated by the daily joint problem solving: \u201cTrust \ncomes from the way we are prepared to come to solutions, not to have dictates\u201d [plant manager]. \nAs at ADL, the union reps shied away from reporting extremely high trust, with one shop \nsteward arguing that knowledge-based trust was \u201cabout the healthiest you can get\u2026 the ideal to \naim for, because it doesn\u2019t harm you to be wary\u201d. Also as at ADL, BWTT\u2019s shop floor workers \nproved less trusting of managers than their representatives are, despite the impressive \ninformation sharing, which is appreciated but still not always believed - a consequence perhaps \nof the plant\u2019s often-uncertain future. What shop floor animosity there was toward partnership \nwas aimed more at the union who \u201crun with the hares and the hounds\u201d [operative]. Many shop \nfloor interviewees expressed annoyance at what they perceive to be \u2018like-it-or-lump-it\u2019 choices \nfrom the union. In response, the convenor dismissed critics as \u201cdinosaurs\u201d who will never trust \nmanagement and offer no alternatives. He believes passionately that partnership constitutes the \nemployees\u2019 best strategic response to Chicago HQ\u2019s investment decisions: \u201cPartnership won\u2019t \nclose this plant down; company politics will\u201d. No challenge to partnership has ever materialised, \nand nor is one likely. \n \nThat BWTT is still operating is, for them, testament to their partnership. The partnership has \nwithstood grave assaults on its founding principles, including three potential final closures. The \ncase study is an example of the adaptability and endurance of partnership. However, it highlights \nthat even a strong local partnership can be undone in a moment by events or decisions beyond \nthe jurisdiction of the partnership. The BWTT partnership, as at ADL, is also heavily reliant on \nthe goodwill secured on a personal level among the key players. The stability in personnel in \nthese key roles over 20 years has evidently been a vital factor.  \n \nCase study 3: \u2018NHS Trust\u2019.8 \n\u2018NHS Trust\u2019 employs 5,000 staff across four main sites, with a further 20 District Nurse \nlocations. It recognises 18 trade unions, of which three predominate: UNISON, MSF and the \nGMB. Overall trade union density is 75%.  \n \nIn 1997 the organisation was \u201chappy to call itself \u2018unhappy\u2019\u201d [then Chairman]. Its industrial \nrelations were antagonistic, with few attempts at joint problem solving. The catalyst for change \ncame with the arrival of a new Chairman, who pressed for an acknowledgement on all sides that \nthis did not fit with the New Labour government\u2019s exhortations on partnership. Over a period of \nsix months a joint working party, operating parallel to the Whitley consultative committee, \ndiscussed different partnership models and received case study presentations. Experiments in \njoint problem solving produced significant \u2018wins\u2019 early on, including the shared research and \nauthorship of around 20 HR policies: \u201cWe undertook an open, free-for-all discussion about the \npolicy in front of us, and as we did we started losing our respective identities as either \u2018staff side\u2019 \n                                                          \n8 The interviews for this study took place in July 2000, a year after the first formal declaration of intent, and three \nyears after the first move toward partnership. The follow-up interviews took place in February and again in October \n2001 due to absences. The third visit came shortly after the Trust approved its revised model of partnership. Note: \nThe organisation requested anonymity for this article.  \n 11\n   \nor \u2018manager\u2019\u201d [manager]. These successes demonstrated to cynics on all sides the merits of the \npartnership approach.  \n \nFifteen months into the process, the now official Partnership Forum produced a \u2018statement of \n[partnership] intent\u2019 confined primarily to well-intentioned aspirations based on the theme of \nmutuality in the IPA model. While it cemented further the joint effort among the key players, the \nwider workforce met it with indifference: \u201cWe\u2019ve had that many mission statements!\u201d [shop \nsteward]. In March 2000 the Forum organised a \u2018meet-the-workforce\u2019 walkabout, pairing union \nreps with managers to go around asking staff for suggestions on ways to improve their own \nworkplace, and to promote the burgeoning partnership. Another shop steward hailed this \u201cthe \nbest thing we\u2019ve ever done\u201d.  \n \nShortly afterwards, the two leading management architects left the Trust. Their replacements \nreiterated support for partnership, but signalled a change in style. Decision-making was \ngradually withdrawn from the Forum\u2019s protracted joint design process and replaced with \nmanagement-penned proposals tabled for discussion, reminiscent for many of the pre-partnership \nera. Explaining the new approach, the new HR Director highlighted what he perceived to be a \nconflict of priorities between administrative effectiveness and the unions\u2019 need to consult their \nmembers adequately: \u201cYou have to continually pose the question, \u2018what is the purpose of using \npartnership?\u2019 Is it for employee involvement and \u2018inclusivity\u2019, or for better policy outcomes?\u201d \nThe HR department began to lead the discussions at the less frequent meetings, and the style of \nengagement switched between partnership-minded joint problem solving and more \nconfrontational tactics, depending on the decision under discussion and the outcome sought. \nSome union reps responded in kind, but others continued to try to work with the new approach.  \n \nThe Forum approved a revised model for partnership in May 2001, with few objections. It was \nintended to \u201cbring the partnership as close as possible to people\u2019s jobs with a representative body \noverlaid on top of that\u201d [HR Director]. In an ongoing process of what the text described as \u201cde-\ncentralisation of authority\u201d the model aspired to an organisation-wide system of \u201cjoint decision-\nmaking wherever possible\u201d, with workplace-level arrangements feeding into sectional \nconsultative forums up to a joint Partnership Group committee whose role would be to issue \nguidance and direction to the lower-level forums.  \n \nIn July 2001 the few \u201cpockets of excellence\u201d at the workplace level had been established by \nenthusiastic, committed departmental managers prior to the new partnership programme. Most \nother departments had not submitted proposals for their workplace arrangements. The HR \nDirector rated the Trust\u2019s new era of partnership as \u201con the whole 4 or 5 out of 10\u201d. The long-\nstanding plan for an employee Board representative, first mooted in 1999, had still not \nmaterialised, largely because the \u2018staff side\u2019 were unable to decide who should take the post. \n(The Chair of the staff side representatives has since been appointed.) Of the other partnership \nelements, employment security was not then a major concern for the Trust\u2019s staff, although the \nHR Director saw it as \u201can absolute pre-requisite for change management\u201d and was developing a \nformal policy statement for the organisation\u2019s future plans. Sharing success is difficult in \nmonetary terms as the Trust does not have local pay bargaining, but it has sought to promote its \npartnership credentials and celebrate its performance achievements with staff. In sum, when the \nresearch period came to an end, the second-phase partnership programme was still in \ndevelopment, but key players\u2019 testimonies made clear that the joint approach was less apparent \nthan before and the process fragmented. Partnership did not appear to be considered the strategy \nfor hitting the Trust\u2019s performance targets, but an adjunct to it.  \n \n 12\n   \nWhen asked to reflect on the shifting degrees of trust during the partnership process, the key \nplayers involved throughout affirmed that trust did improve, from deterrence-based to \nknowledge-based trust as parties \u201cmade in-roads\u2026 doing something together\u201d [HR manager]. A \nshop steward agreed: \u201cWe had worked enough together that there was \u2018much less reliance on the \nthreat of sanction\u2019\u201d. Assessments on relations in 2001 however revealed contradictory \nimpressions and less conviction. Indicative of this was that most key players pitched their \nresponses around the threshold of positive trust (i.e. between calculus-based and knowledge-\nbased). Perceptions were susceptible to individuals\u2019 enthusiasm for partnership, and the quality \nof working friendships (deterrence-based with some; relational-based with others). Similarly, \ntrust levels were felt to wax and wane, depending on the issue involved \u2013 indicative of a \nfragmented partnership programme and inconsistent negotiating tactics. While one shop steward \nbemoaned the \u201ccosy monthly discussions\u2026 too much patting on the back, we\u2019re not actually \ndoing it [partnership]\u201d, the HR Director\u2019s view was less positive, with relations only \u201ctending \ntoward\u201d knowledge-based trust.  \n \nThe experience at \u2018NHS Trust\u2019 is illustrative of three key aspects of the idea of partnership: its \nadaptability (or vulnerability) to shifting definitions and structures, as well as personnel; the need \nto demonstrate consistently partnership-oriented behaviours but also the debate as to what these \nin fact are and how far they can be extended, and finally, arguably, the value of institutionalising \npartnership systems. \n \nFindings: Partnership and the development of trust. \nAll three case study organisations satisfy the IPA criteria for a genuine partnership, albeit with \nsome concerns about the quality of certain elements (Figure 3).  \n \nFIGURE 3: IS EACH CASE STUDY A GENUINE PARTNERSHIP? \n \nThe bulk of key players\u2019 self-reports accounting for shifts in degrees of trust tallied consistently \nwith the narrative of their organisation\u2019s partnership. In the three unionised cases reflections \noverwhelmingly, though not unanimously, pointed to major improvements in trust following the \npartnership (from deterrence-based trust up to and including identification-based trust) between \npeople who previously had been locked in bitter conflict. However, trust levels wavered when \nthe partnership process seemed to falter, notably at \u2018NHS Trust\u2019 and ADL. It did not when the \npartnership process remained robust (BWTT).   \n \nThe frequency of joint problem solving across an extended range of workplace issues, in tandem \nwith open and honest information sharing, was most commonly cited as having the greatest \neffect on progress toward partnership and in developing trust. This finding is readily predictable \nfrom the trust literature (cf. Whitener et al\u2019s \u2018sharing and delegation of control\u2019 and \n\u2018communication\u2019). It echoes D\u2019Art and Turner who found that increased personal contact, the \nintroduction of a common or super-ordinate goal and employee participation in collaborative \ninitiatives with managers all shifted attitudes toward co-operation and increased trust (1999: 103-\n4; also Deery, Erwin & Iverson, 1999). Gall (2001: 368), Badigannavar (2002: 48-49) and Wills \n(2002) have also reported the value of information sharing to partnership. Also viewed very \npositively were early tangible demonstrations of mutual gain (\u2018demonstration of concern\u2019), \nespecially provisions for employment security. All three case studies featured such a policy, but \nMartinez-Lucio and Stuart found very few in their partnership research with the MSF (2002: \n314). Surprisingly, none of the interviewees seemed to value sharing success as a positive and \nhelpful outcome. Much of this re-emphasises long-standing findings that collaborative \u2018mutual \n 13\n   \ngains\u2019 industrial relations, based on information sharing and joint participation in decision-\nmaking, leads to greater trust (see Fox, 1974; Batstone et al., 1977; Purcell, 1981).9 \n  \nThe central lesson of all three case studies is that the manner in which the partnership principles \nand policies are executed, and embodied in the attitudes and behaviours of the key players, is of \nfar greater significance than structures and practices: \u201cGood processes matter more than \ninstitutions\u201d (Guest and Peccei, 1998: 9). \u2018NHS Trust\u2019 had designed a potentially exemplary \nmodel, but had yet to develop consistently the requisite attitudes and behaviours, while BWTT \nhad perhaps the least impressive practices on paper, but its key players demonstrated high mutual \ntrust. Both partnership and trust fared better where there was persistent effort to uphold its \nprincipled commitments (\u2018integrity\u2019 and \u2018consistency\u2019), echoing the findings from Guest and \nPeccei (1998), and where parties delivered on their promise of mutually beneficial outcomes \n(\u2018demonstration of concern\u2019). Where behaviour was either inconsistent or ran contrary to \npartnership\u2019s spirit, or mutual benefits were either not forthcoming or not immediately tangible, \ninterviewees tended to report trust faltering around the threshold between calculus-based and \nknowledge-based trust. This seemed to have the debilitating effect on progress that the literature \non trust would lead us to expect. It follows that the original partnership signatories, or like-\nminded persons, must maintain control of the process. Where there was disruption to the \u2018elite\u2019 \npersonnel (\u2018NHS Trust\u2019, ADL) partnership, and trust, suffered setbacks, whereas continuity \ncontributed to trust levels being generally higher (BWTT). These findings are straightforward \nenough, even tautological, but they are not without their problematic implications (discussed \nbelow).  \n \nA major finding is that in all three cases the enhanced trust seemed to be confined in the main to \nan \u2018elite\u2019 of key players. Their powerful trust levels were not felt to be replicated to anything like \nthe same extent in relationships between \u2018the organisation\/ management\u2019 and the \u2018shop floor\u2019 in \ngeneral. Marks et al (1998: 225), Heaton et al (2002: 123) and Geary and Roche (2003: 41) all \nreport a comparable fissure in opinion on partnership and\/or trust. Most shop floor employees \nwere non-key players and so, by definition, uninvolved in the main partnership process. Few had \ndeveloped much appreciation of partnership; it seemed peripheral to their working lives and they \nfelt unable to comment. They expressed at best lukewarm support tinged with scepticism, or \nshrugged with ambivalence. None were hostile (although all three organisations have cynics, on \nboth sides). The trust literature provides an explanation for this mismatch. Trust typically relies \nupon direct personal engagement with the other party in a collaborative process. If only the key \nplayers interact with each other in this way, and non-key players are unable to exert much \ninfluence on partnership\u2019s decision-making, then the latter are more likely to feel vulnerable and \nless confident in bestowing trust. Accordingly, one might speculate that trust levels on the shop \nfloor will be higher where managers meet more frequently with them, and\/or devolve joint \nproblem-solving properly to them. Where this is not feasible, the key players should share \ninformation openly and explain the reasons for organisational decisions, lest they be seen as a \n                                                          \n9 That said, quantitative research on partnership has proved somewhat agnostic on the link with trust. Martinez-\nLucio and Stuart\u2019s (2002) sample of MSF union officials delivered a mean level of trust of only 3.57 on a 1-5 scale \nfor their relations with managers. Some of these respondents might not be dealing with an IPA-standard of \npartnership however, and it would be interesting to learn the trust levels inside those firms that did conform to the \nIPA definition. Geary and Roche\u2019s study within Aer Rianta, an impressive example of partnership in Ireland, asked \nemployees to respond on a 1-5 scale to the item, \u201cBetter understanding and trust exist between management and \nemployees\u201d as a result of partnership. They report a mean response of only 2.75, with 2 indicating \u2018disagreement\u2019 \n(2003: 49). Based on the propositions put forward here, one might expect the trust between the key players and \nmanagement to be rather higher. Finally, Badigannavar reports higher trust levels inside his non-unionised \npartnership retail firm, when compared with other retail firms surveyed in the British Workplace Representation and \nParticipation Survey (2002: 49). \n 14\n   \nremote elite, a self-serving \u201ccosy club\u201d. (That said, the BWTT experience suggests that not even \nthis can be assumed.)  \n \nCan partnership deliver? \nThere are few sensible objections to the spread of trust at work, beyond the pitfalls of \ncomplacency, complicity and unreasonable constraint, or Bachman\u2019s warning of a \u201cfa\u00e7ade of \ntrust\u201d (1998: 311). The IPA\u2019s partnership definition offers much to allay these fears. Instead, \ntrust is widely commended for its impact on performance through efficiency gains from lower \ntransaction costs, its ability to deliver active consent to change, and for its facilitation of more \npositive employment relations (see Arrow, 1974; Barney & Hansen, 1994; Whitener, 1997). \nInterviewees\u2019 testimonies from all three case study organisations indicate that partnership can \ndeliver these outcomes. Additionally, each organisation could point to better terms and \nconditions for its employees, although claims to a better quality of working life would be \ncontentious in some settings where the research found evidence of increased workloads \nnegotiated as part of the partnership. Overall, the cases provide evidence of partnership\u2019s \npotential and attractiveness to different constituencies in three different settings. \n \nThe partnership process is however fraught with risk, centring around its reliance on behavioural \nconsistency and integrity, and regular delivery of mutual benefits. These two attributes may be \npartnership\u2019s greatest selling point, but may also prove something of an Achilles heel. Can \npartnership\u2019s code of honour and its balanced exchange of acceptable mutual gains be sustained? \nEventually most relationships, partnership or otherwise, reach one party\u2019s \u2018line in the sand\u2019. Gall \nquotes a UNIFI union rep posing \u201cthe unanswered question\u2026 what will happen when they [the \nemployers] want something very badly and we want very badly to stop it?\u201d (2001: 369). \nResisting opportunism might not always be in the parties\u2019 best interests and joint problem \nsolving may not always be able to accommodate every factional interest. What then? The \nparadox is that the fall-out from error, or abuse of strong trust, may prove much worse than if \nparties had not attempted to improve trust at all. A BWTT shop steward borrowed a football \nmanagers\u2019 clich\u00e9 to explain partnership as viewed through the prism of trust: perhaps it is \u201conly \nas good as the last result\u201d?  \n \nFew clues on how partnership can cope with this dilemma are discernible in the content of \nagreements or policies; each organisation has very different arrangements after all. Again, the \ncase studies suggest instead that the strength or otherwise of partnership, and of trust, resides in \nthe informal relationships forged among the key players, and their capacity to translate the terms \nof an agreement into tangible results and perhaps even into cultural norms. This reliance on \n\u201cpersonalities\u201d, continuity of personnel and consistent mutually supportive behaviour does \nrender partnership and trust inherently fragile, but the case studies provide encouraging evidence \nof partnership\u2019s resilience and longevity \u2013 although none are assured permanence of course.   \n \nShould partnership therefore be formalised (Reilly, 2002)? Oxenbridge and Brown (2002: 269) \nfound that informal partnerships (i.e. those governed primarily by close relationships and \nbehavioural codes) were more successful than partnerships with more formal procedural \nregulations, but Heaton and colleagues found the reverse (2002: 117). In the case studies \npresented here a formal agreement seemed to act as a catalyst for further progress, but each \npartnership seems to have drawn its strength from both its formal and informal codes of \nbehaviour. Here, the trust literature is instructive. Creed and Miles (1996) claim, persuasively, an \ninverse link between the extent of control and the extent of trust: where there is too much control \nthere is, by definition, too little trust. But the reverse is also true. Control, and even coercion, \ncomes into play when adequate trust is not present. This may be the case at the start of a \npartnership process (Boxall & Purcell, 2003: 178), but should diminish as trust develops. Too \n 15\n   \nmuch trust however can reduce monitoring and invite the prospect of \u2018defection\u2019 or betrayal. It \nwould seem prudent therefore to recommend that a modest, achievable and valuable outcome \nfrom partnership would be the establishment and sustainability of positive and efficient \nknowledge-based trust, and in more sophisticated and long-standing forms, relational-based trust. \nParties would do well to reflect upon Gambetta\u2019s conclusion: \u201cAsking too little of trust is just as \nill-advised as asking too much\u201d (1988: 235). \n \nAcknowledgements. \nMany thanks to the three organisations and to Willy Coupar of the IPA for facilitating this \nresearch, to Stephen Dunn for supervising this research, to former colleagues at the LSE and \ncurrent colleagues at EUR for helpful suggestions on earlier drafts, and to two anonymous \nreferees. \n 16\n   \nREFERENCES. \n \nACAS.
