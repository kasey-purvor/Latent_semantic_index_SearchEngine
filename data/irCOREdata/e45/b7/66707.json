The new secular age, heralded by the philosophical developments of\nthe Enlightenment and major events such as American Independence and the\nFrench Revolution, signalled a sea-change in music's function within society,\nand the church, once the principal patron, and indeed custodian, of musical\n'progress', saw its relationship with the art and its diverse profession decline as\nother musical genres became the foci for creativity and ambition. The opera\nhouse replaced the church as the 'cathedral' ofthe bourgeoisie, while the con-\ncert hall became the home of the new cultural intelligentsia and cognoscenti\nas instrumental music assumed a supremacy over vocal. As Julian Rushton\nhas pointed out, 'churches were themselves partly responsible for the fact that\ntheir liturgies were no longer the natural home of advanced musical art'.'\nEighteenth-century Lutheran music provides an apposite illustration of\nhow the steady growth of pietism and the influence of Calvinism wimessed\na decline away from the ornate creations ofcantatas, motets and chorale pre-\nludes, until, by tSOO, the music of German Protestantism consisted of little\nmore than the singing of chorales. No better example of this process can be\nobserved than at Leipzig by the comparison between]. S. Bach's sophisticated\nsacred works written for his post as cantor at St Thomas's Church, and those\nofhis successor,]. A. Hiller, who wrote little for the liturgy. Though less draco-\nnian, the Catholic Church was also driven by a reforming zeal which eschewed\nthe use of instrumental music in the liturgy except as a subordinate role to\nvoices. Such restrictions only served to galvanise agreaterpolernical distinction\nberween 'old' and 'new' in church music. As evidenced by the works ofMozart,\nHaydn, Jomelli, Galuppi and Pergolesi, the 'strict' practice of counterpoint,\nI Rushton. Classicnl music. p. 118.\n12J\nJEREMY DIBBLE\ndemonstrated in fugues and the Palestrina-inspired 'motet' style, stood out\nin marked conttast ro the style galanl and the imported, florid style of opera.\nPerhaps the most ferrile synthesis of late classical liturgical styles was the\nsymphonic mass - works for four-part choir, otchestra and organ continuo -\nmost prevalent in Catholic Austria and its wealthy monastical tradition. Joseph\nHaydn's last six masses, composed for the court at Esterhazy, are often\ncited as the most typical examples of the genre, but there was considerable\nindustry throughout the empire with F. X. Brixi in Bohemia (prague) and\nK. V. Wramy in Slovenia (Ljubljana and Corizia) as authors of many works.\nThe greatest and most substantial industry, however, took place in Salzburg\nwhere, under the patronage of Archbishop CoUoredo, Mozart and Haydn's\nbrother Michael were active. Economic privation, caused by Austria's war\nwith Napoleon, constrained musical activity, and the larger, more ambitious\nmasses (and requiems) were commissioned as pieces d'occasion. The tradition\nofthe symphonic mass continued ro enjoy popularity inro the nineteenth cen-\nrury. Humme.l produced an appreciable corpus of masses as concert master\nro the Esterhazy court berween 1804 and 1811; Beethoven was commissioned\nby the Esterhazy court ro write his Mass in C (1807) and Cherubini's personal\nfusion of ancient and modern techniques gave rise ro rwo fine requiems, in\nC minor (1816) and D minor (1836), and several Solemn Masses for the restored\nBourbon monarchy in Paris. Even by the middle ofthe cenrury, Bruckner, then\na monastery organist at St Florian, was still wedded to the paradigms of the\nclassical mass, as can be seen in his Requiem (1848--9) and Missa Solemnis (1854).\nWith the transformation of Bruckner's style in the late 1860s, his later masses\nexpanded in length and spirirual aspiration ro a point where their narural home\nwas the concert hall, a tendency he shared with the earlier conceptions of\nBeethoven's monumental Missa Solemnis (1819-23) and Schubert's late masses\nin A flat (1819-22) and E flat (1828). Indeed, dUring the later nineteenth cenrury,\nthe mass and requiem developed into a large-scale choral genre comparable\nwith the orarorio in terms ofits dramatic and narrative possibilities, and open\nto a wide range ofheterodox interpretations ranging from those oftraditional\nbelievers (Dvorak, Liszt, Bruckner, Counod and Stanford), through the scep-\ntical (Berlioz, Brahms and Faure), ro the outright atheist (Verdi and Delius).\nThe liberal thought ofthe Enlightenment and the new aesthetics ofRoman-\nticism inevitably provoked debate within the ecclesiastical arena and across\ndenominational barriers, motivated by a desire ro restore a sense oftraditional\nreligious sentiment, the authority of the church and the imperative of the\nliturgy, and by a sensibility inspired by the Romantic era itself - a longing for\nthe past and a passion for hisroricisation. An early eighteenth-cenrury fervour\n122\nMusical trends and the western church\nfor an 'ideal' church music with little or no instrumental participation gave\ntise to the establishment ofCaecilian-Biindnisse (Cecilian Leagues) in Munich,\nPassau and Vienna as well as in other cities in Bavaria and Austria, and found\nendorsement in Pope Benedict XIV's encyclical of1749, later pronouncements\nby Leo XII in 1824 and Pius VIn in 1830, and most notably Pope Pius X's Mati<\nProprio in 19\u00b03, which, besides giving final enfranchisement to Cecilianism,\nintended to proscribe perceived aberrant practices in countries such as Italy.\nThe aesthetic principles of a 'true church music' had begun to emerge in the\nwritings of Herder, J. F. Reichardt, K. A. von Mastiaux, Friedrich and August\nWilhelm von Schlegel and J. A. P. Schulz, whose ideas chimed with the Fuxian\nstile antico ('the Palestrina style') ofcomposers such as C. P. E. Bach and espe-\ncially Michael Haydn. The latrer, in his sacred works, demonstrated a singular\nenthusiasm for archaic musical techniques including canon, fugue, imitation,\nuse ofcantus firmi, and much effective yet practicably accessible homophonic\nwriting (particularly in the Gradual settings). These works not only made him\npopular within the nineteenth-century Catholic Church bur also ensured his\nreputation (which, sadly, has not endured to the same extent as his brother's\nin the province ofsecular music).\nMichael Haydn's sacred ourput drew the approbation ofE. T. A. Hoffinann,\nwhose Alte und neue Kirchenmusik (18t4) proved to be influential on the Cecil-\nians along with A. F. J. Thibaut's widely read Uber Reinlteit der Tonkunst (1825)\nand Sailer's Von dent Bunde der Religion mit der Kunst (1839). The Cecilian move-\nment sought to re-create a style ofsacred music that was equal to the purity,\ndevotion and 'unworldliness' of Palestrina, a composer who enjoyed iconic\nstatus among Catholic reformers. Palestrina's pre-eminence was given further\nimpetus by the Italian musicologist and one-time choir member of the papal\nchapel Giuseppe Baini, who produced an historical study of the composer\n(1828). Ln F. S. Kandler's translation, published posthumously and edited by\nR. G. Kiesewetter (who himself produced a study of the Netherlands com-\nposers), Baini's book was widely disseminated and contributed significantly\nto the extraordinary escalation of Palestrina's standing throughout Europe,\nnot least through the popularity ofms Stabat Mater and Missa Papae Marcelli as\nconcert works. Other important literary and scholady works followed, with\nWinterfeld's biography in 1834, Bellerman's theoretical treatise in r862 and\nA. W. Ambros's informative commentary in volume IV of his Gesclticltte der\nMusik (1878); Parry included him in his Studies ofgreat composers (1887) and\nHans Pfitzner painted a romanticised picture of the composer in his opera,\nPalestrinA, of 1915. As for Palestrina's music, Baini's editions (begun in 1841 and\ncompleted by Alfieri in 1846) in the Raccolto di musica sacra were superseded\n123\nJEREMY DIBBLE\nby a monumental series in thirty-three volumes under the editorial leadership\nofF. X. Haberl between 1862 and 1903\u00b7\nAs musical Romanticism gathered momentum, so did the fervour and influ-\nence of the CeciJian movement which spread outwards from Bavaria. An\nimportant symbolic event on Good Friday 1816 was the revival of Gregorio\nAllegri's setting of Psalm 51 (the Miserere) at the service ofTenebrae by Ett and\nSchmid. Once the exclusive property of the papal choir in Rome, this most\nfamous of penitential works impressed Mozart in 1770 and later both Goethe\nand Mendelssohn were deeply moved by it. Ett's efforts to revive sacred music\nof the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries received the suppOrt of King\nLudwig I of Bavaria, but much of the significant scholarly work was taken\nup by Carl Proske at Regensburg. Proske, whose Denkschrift, Die Verbessmmg\nder Domkirchenmusik of 1829-30 was hugely influential, did much to promote\na new musicological rigour as part of the Cecilian ideals. A vast collector of\nCatholic liturgical works, he began to publish them in tbe collection Musica\nDivina in 1853; three volumes were published during his lifetime and a fourth\nposthumously in 1864 (further publications were continued by Franz X. Haberl\nfrom 1872). Haberl was even more important in this branch of scholarship. In\naddition to the work he continued for Musica Divi\"il after the death ofProske,\nhe founded a Palestrina society in 1879 and took on the demanding task of\nediting the complete Palestrina edition begun by Breirkopfand Hartel in 1862.\nWith the musicologist Adolf Sandberger, he worked on the early volumes of\nthe complete edition ofLassus's music, and produced new books ofplainchant\nbased on the Editio Medicaea of 1614, approved by Rome in ]868. These edi-\ntions, however, were effectively made redundant when Pius X sanctioned the\nEditio Vatica\"a (19\u00b05-23) prepared by Gui:ranger, jausions and Pothier of the\nBenedictine Abbey at Solesmes. This religious foundation would henceforth\nfind itselfat the vanguard of the plainchant revival, with such seminal though\ncontroversial publications as Pothier's Les melodies gregoriennes (t880) and Liber\nUsualis (1883).\nHaberl was encouraged by Liszt (who remained on the margins of the\nCecilian orbit) and Franz X. Witt who, with Michael Haller, composed works\nfor publication (and which came recommended as part of the CeciJian move-\nment's promulgation through their journals). Witt's most important contri-\nbution, however, lay in his proselytisation of the Cecilian goals, through his\nediting of several key Cecilian journals, his seminal publication Der Zustand\nder karlIoluchen KiTchemnusik zuniidut in Altbayern (1865), and the founding of\nthe Allgemeiner Deutscher Cacilienverein in 1868. As a result of the work\nof Proske, Haberl and Witt, Regensberg became the centre of scholarship,\n124\nMusical trends and the western church\neducation and a cappella performance in the later nineteenth century, and\nthe foundation of the Regensburger Domsparzen (the Regensburg cathedral\nchoir), with boys and men, which was (and remains) well known throughout\nCatholic Europe.\nWith the powerful endorsement of successive popes, the Cecilian reforms\nwere also embraced in France (Choron and Niedermeyer), Italy (Basili,\nSpontini, Baini, Alfieri. Zingarelli and Raimondi), Spain (Eslava), Switzerland\n(Schubiger) and Belgium (Fetis). In Belgium, the cause of Catholic church\nmusic was taken up by the organist, teacher and composerJaak Nikolaas Lem\u00b7\nmens, who. under the auspices of the Belgian bishops, established the Ecole\nde Musique Religieuse at Mechelen in January 1879. There Lemmens inaugu-\nrated the Societe de St Gregoire, an organisation devoted to the amelioration of\nmusical standards in church which involved the training ofcletgy, organists and\nchoirmasters. Lemmens led his new institute until his death in 1881, after which\nthe cause was taken up by his successor and ardent Cecilian, Edgard Tinel. One\nofthe most significant effects ofthe institute and its training was the number of\nFlemish organists invited over by the Irish bishops to fill new posts in the cathe-\ndrals and larger churches in Ireland, where church buildingsince Emancipation\nin 1829 had been extremely active. Through the work of Archbishop Cullen,\nmoves to establish a footing for Irish chutch music were made at the Synod of\nThurles in t850 in which the Cecilian ideals of Palestrina and Gregorian chant\nwere reiterated. Irish church music moved into a higher gear, however, when\nthe German priest and Haberl pupil Heinrich Bewerunge was appointed to\nthe chair of 'Church Chant and Organ' at St Patrick's College, Maynooth in\nJune 1888. Bewerunge, an important scholar and commentator on maners of\nCatholic church music. proved to be one of the most significant musical forces\nin Ireland. He was not blind to the merits and cultural contemporaneity of\nopera in western music. but this admiration was articulated as a means of\nexplicating the need for a distinctive musical voice for the expression ofsacred\nethics and doctrinal truths.' Bewerunge's advocacy of Palestrina and Lassus\nwas later endorsed by Edward Martyn who. emanating from Catholic landed\ngentry in County Galway, had the means to endow the choir of St Mary's Pro-\nCathedral with the princely sum of \u00a310,000 in order to establish its Palestrina\nChoir. At much the same time, English Catholicism saw the foundation of\nits own cathedral choir at Westminster Cathedral in 1903 under R. R. Terry.\nThe Westminster choir generated excitement outside Catholic circles for its\nperformances of Palestrina, Victoria and Lassus, which not only spawned a\n2 See \\Vhite. The Keeper's rrcitnl, pp. 74-93.\n\u00a325\nJEREMY DIBBLE\nrevival of interest in Britain's Tudor heritage but also encouraged contempo-\nraries such as Stanford, Charles Wood and Holst to write contemporary Latin\nworks in an archaic sryle.\nWhile many in the Catholic Church welcomed the Cecilians' historicising\nreforms, there was significant opposition from many quarters to the conser-\nvative restraints implied by the movement's search for a 'pure' ecclesiasti-\ncal sryle. Moreover, there seemed little scope for aspiring composers to step\nbeyond the limited srylistic parameters laid down by Cecilian values; indeed,\nmuch of the original liturgical music wrinen by Cecilian composers was, by\ndint of its own aesthetic and theological imperatives, artistically modest and\noften banal. Adherents to the new harmonic progressivism, such as Liszt and\nBruckner (and even the more conservative Rheinberger), were scorned for\ntheir 'secularism'. Indeed Bruckner's extraordinary corpus ofmoters, notably\n'Ave Maria' (1861), the graduals 'Locus iste' (1869) and 'Christus factus est'\n(1879), the antiphon 'Ecce sacerdos magnum' (1885) and the Mass in E minor\nfor choir and windband (1866, bur revised in 1876 and 1882), shocked many\nhearers by their shameless chromaticism and tonal dissolution, even though\nthose very constituents of plainchant and strict counterpoint were still active\ncurrency in the composer's language. Others such as Johannes Habert spent\ntheir lives waging an offensive against the Cecilian proscription of instru-\nmental music in church, and defiantly performed the Viennese symphonic\nmasses in Austrian churches and cathedrals. In Italy, where opera and instru-\nmental concertato reigned supreme, congregations were more accustomed to\nhearing arias, cavatinas, military marches, brilliant organ solos and boisterous\nchoruses. Sacred texts would be adapted to familiar operatic numbers, oper-\natic singers were drafted in to sing for solemn feast days and it was common\nto hear well-known arias of Rossini, Donizerti, BelJini and Mercadante. It was\na srylistic mindset that cut across the growing school of Vatican-based Cecil-\nian musicians such as Bain; and Basily, and none other than Spontini, once at\nthe forefront of European opera with works such as La Vestale and Olympie,\ndenounced the profane demeanour of the music he heard in Italian churches\nin 1839' The truth was that Italy's churchgoers did not distinguish between\nthe 'sacred' and the 'profane', nor did irs foremost composers such as Rossini,\nwho happily juxtaposed 'learned' polyphony and fugues with operatic arias in\nhis Stabat Mater (1832, rev. 1841) and Petite messe solennelle (1863). Furthermore,\nItalian church choirs, which suffered a serious decline in numbers dUring the\nlast third of the nineteenth century, were less well equipped to deal with the\n3 Hutchings, Church music, pp. 61-:1.\n126\nMusical trends and the western church\ndemands ofpolyphony. It was a situation exacerbated by Motu Proprio which,\nin anempting to stem the seculat musical practices ofmany Italian churches,\nforbade women to sing in church choirs, much to the chagrin ofmore liberal\nCatholic organists such as Konrad Swertz (Cork), who resigned and emigrated\nto the USA in disgust.\nIn France, church music experienced a major hiatus after the Revolution in\n1789. Since 1725, under the aegis ofPhilidor's concerts spirituels, Parisians were\nfamiliar with hearing church music performed outside church, and much elab-\norate church music in the form ofthe'grand motet' had become a fashionable\nfeature of concert-going. By the Revolution there is evidence that interest in\nthis genre of sacred music was already in decline, and a more dramatic form\nofchurch music, influenced by oratorio, was in the ascendant and led byJean-\nFran,ois Le Sueur, the director ofthe choir ofNotre-Dame Cathedral between\n1786 and 1787. Le Sueur's innovations were censured by the cathedral chapter\nand he was dismissed, but his appoinrrnent later as director of the Tuileries\nChapel under Napoleon meant that his ideas could be reintroduced. After the\nRevolution the choir schools (the maitrises) were abolished and there followed\na period of silence for almost twelve years, until the concordat ofJuly 1801,\nwhen little or no sacred music was composed or sung publicly. After the sign-\ning of the concordat, Napoleon, as first consul, quickly resolved to continue\nthe traditions offormer French kings by establishing a chapel in the Tuileries.\nAn admirer of Italian opera, notably the music of Paisiello and Cimarosa, he\nappointed the Neapolifan composer Paisiello as his new musical director of\nthe chapel. Extremely well paid in his new post and the envy of his jealous\nFrench contemporaries, Paisiello composed large quantities of church music\nfor his employer including masses and motets, but failed to succeed at the\nGrand Opera, where his own brand of Italian opera serio conflicted with the\nemerging new operatic styles of Mehul, Le Sueur, Cherubini and Spontini.\nDisenchanted with his artistic predicament in Paris, Paisiello left France in\nthe spring of 1804, having already composed a lavish serring of the Te Deum\nfor Napoleon's coronation in the following December. He was succeeded by\nLe Sueur, who remained in place until 1830, sharing the position with]. P. E,\nMartini after the Restoration ofthe Bourbons in 1816 and with Cherubini after\nMartini's death in 1816. The Tuileries Chapel was unquestionably the most\nimportant focus of French church music for the first thirty years of the nine-\nteenth century, and its surviving payrolls bear wimess to an ever-increasing\nnumber of singers and instrumentalists and a lavish repertoire of masses,\nfuneral music, settings of the Stabat Mater and other miscellaneous pieces,\nnot only by their directors but also by Plantade, Gossec, Martini, Zingarelli,\nU7\nJEREMY DIBBLE\nDurante, Jomelli, Roze and Persuis.' After the 1830 Revolution, however, Le\nSueur and Cherubini were made redundant (as were their large retinue ofmusi-\ncians) by the new regime under the 'citizen king', Louis-Philippe, and though\nNapoleon UI revived the ChapelJe Royale, the music was neveras flamboyant or\nspeclacular.\nMany of the large-scale works for Napoleon's chapel and the Chapelle\nRoyale of Louis XVllI and Charles X were composed in an operatic and the-\natrical style largely devoid of coumerpoint and the style severe (the equivalem\nof the stile antieo). Of varied quality, it nevertheless srood in stark contrast ro\nthe poor state of music in the cathedrals and parishes where linle more than\nplainchant was sung. Some relief came with the resroration of a few maitrises\n(such as the one at Norre-Dame) which proved ro be the only significant agency\nofmusical education during the Monarchy, but the church, impoverished after\nthe Revolurion and war, had only meagre funds ro support music. Aware of\nthis glaring deficiency, and in contradistinction to the musical trends set by\nthe courts ofthe head ofstate, the composer, publisher and teacher Alexandre\nChoron rook up the mantle ofpromoting sacred works by the Italian masters,\nand though publication of this music ultimately failed through lack ofpublic\nsubScription, Choron continued to pursue his interest in 'historical' music.\nAfter the Resroration he published his Collection des pieces de musique religiellse\nqui s'exeClltent tOllS les ans Ii Rome durant La semaine sainte dans La Chapelle du Sou-\nverain Pontife (1820) which drew broadly on Burney's eponymous collection; it\nmade available a range ofItalian aeappella works ro a French public largely unfa-\nmiliar with early church music, a familiarity reinforced by the performance\nof Renaissance and Baroque music by srudems of his own school, the Instiru-\ntion Royale de Musique Classique et Religieuse (opened in 1818). With lack of\nfunds, however, Choron's school declined and it was only after public concern\nwas expressed for the low standards of musical anainmem in church that the\nFrench government agreed financially ro support a reopening of the instiru-\ntion in 18;3 as the Ecole Niedermeyer, named after its leader Louis Nieder-\nmeyer, a Swiss educationist and composer. The mission ofNiedermeyer was ro\nrevitalise France's atrophying church music tradition and the maimses. More\u00b7\nover, in addition ro a basic education, pupils at the school were to gain a\nfirm grounding in plainchant and its accompanimem, a broad knowledge of\nPalestrina, and, at the organ, a thorough understanding of the methods ofJ.\nS. Bach. Niedermeyer collaborated with Joseph d'Ortigue in the publication\nof his Traite theorique et pratique de !'accompagnement dll plaineltant (18;7) in\n4 See Mongredien, Fmu:11 music. pp. 162.-87.\n\u202228\nMusical trends and the western church\nwhich he attempted to demonstrate how modern harmonic practices and the\nmodality ofplainchant could be reconciled; the two men also collaborated in\nLa Maimse, a periodical devoted ro higher standards of musical performance\nin sacred worship, though it only endured for four years between 1857 and\n1861. Though a competent composer himself, Niedermeyer was more influ-\nential in his teaching. By all accounts his rolerance ofcontemporary harmony,\nwith particular emphasis on enharmonic modulation, the use ofmore distant\ntonalities, a freer attitude ro dissonance and a creative use of modal colour in\nharmonic progressions, suggests that his methods were more advanced and\nliberal than those of the Paris Conservatoire. After Niedermeyer's death in\n1861, Saint-Saens was appointed ro the school, where he taught until 1865.\nThough infrequently sung, Saint-Saenss corpus of sacred works, much of it\nfor organ and a range of soloists, is varied and extensive, added ro which his\nsuhtle yet conservative harmonic language is well suited ro the constraints\nadvocated by Niedermeyer; yet there is also something of the civilised salon in\nhis musical rheroric and the refined taste of Massenet. Saint-Saens numbered\namong his pupils Andre Messager, Eugene Gigoutand Gabriel Faure, ofwhom\nthe latter benefited enormously from the atmosphere of the Ecole.' Perhaps\nmore than any other composer ofhis generation, Faure overtly espoused the\nmodal leanings of his 'harmonic' education wtuch he used with increasing\ncreativity and originality in his output. Although substantially Mendelssohn-\nian in form (a 'song without words') and gesrure, the early Cantique de Jean\nRacine Op. IJ of1865 bears many ofthe embryonic hallmarks ofthe composer's\nintense harmonic vocabulary. The later Messe basse (1881, and revised by Faure\nin 1906) has more ofthat individual tonal and modal amalgam so recognisable\nin the Requiem, first performed at the Madeleine church in 1888 with small\norchestra and organ, a boy soprano for the 'Pie Jesu', and the soprano line\ntaken by the children Faure trained at the church. In this unconventional work\n(undoubtedly suited best for a lirurgical context rather than the concert hall),\nFaure was able ro merge those distinguishing elements ofan 'old' style (in his\ndeployment of modal harmonies and melodic lines) with a 'new' romantic\nparlance, showing some awareness of Wagner and Liszt, yet also displaying\nsomething strikingly modern whether in the stark trirones and austere, imita-\ntive counterpoint at the opening ofthe Offertoire or the chromatic harmonies\nthat accompany quasi-plainchant lines in the Kyrie. Faure's delicate musical\nchemistry perfectly embodied the composer's agnostic spiriruality which was\ndevoid of all sense ofjudgement or damnation. A different French sensibility\n5 Orledge. Gabn-d Faurr. pp. 6-7.\n129\nJEREMY DIBBLE\nwas manifested in the fifteen masses ofGounod, which reveal a multiplicity of\nstyles, endorsing the purity ofPalestrina at one end ofthe spectrum (such as the\nMesse dire de Clovis of 1895) and the unabashedly emotional and richly operatic\nat the other (the Messe solonelle de Sainte Cecile of 1855). As Alfred Einstein said\nofthe latter: This Mass tends towards Catholicism, but it is not itselfCatholic.\nDespite one or another grandiose and orchestrally unified movement like the\nCredo, it is poetical, subjective, lyric. It is Romanticized church music.'\" A\nsimilar tendency is exhibited in the sacred works of Cesar Franck, Guilmant,\nPierne, Widor and the gargantuan Messe soloneUe of Vierne for choir and two\norgans written for Saint-Suipice.\nAfter the decline of Lutheran church music at the end of the eighteenth\ncentury, a revival inspired by Frederick William IV of Prussia's unification of\nthe liturgy gave momentum to the churches and cathedrals in Berlin, and\nprovided a creative impetus for composers such as Mendelssohn and musi-\ncologists such as J. A. Spitta and R. von Liliencron. As president of the edi-\ntorial commission of the Denkmiiler deutscher TonkllllSt, Liliencron did much\nto contribute to the revival of early German masters (notably Senfl, Prae-\ntorius, Schutz and Bach), but, unlike the southern German churches, where\nearly music was fulsomely embraced as a liturgical vehicle, the scholarly prod-\nucts of the north Germans were restricted to the more structured liturgies of\ncathedrals or to the concert halls. Such limitations did not, however, prevent\nsome Palestrina advocates of the 'revival', such as A. E. Grell, from taking a\nthoroughly dogmatic and didactic position condemning instrumental music\nas an anathema to church, school and domestic music-making. Mendelssohn's\neclectic background, which assimilated Bach and Handel as well as the Clas-\nsicists, was also open to a Romantic interpretation of Renaissance polyphony\nand the Gabrielis, a fact evident in his selling of'Ehre sei Gott in der Hohe',\n'Heilig, heilig ist Gott', the brief but sublime 'Kyrie' and the Sechs Spniche\nOp. 79 written after he was appointed director of Berliner Domchor in 1843,\nThe twO psalms Opp. 78 and 91 are altogether more Romantic in deport-\nment, as are the outer sections of the 'Ave Maria' Op. 23 No.2, though the\ncentral section of the latter reveals Mendelssohn's devotion to Bach, one of\ncourse reflected in his all-important revival of Bach's Sr Matthew Passion at\nthe Singakademie in 1829. The amalgam of Mendelssohn's Protestant sacred\nstyle was later promoted by Grell's pupil, Arnold Mendelssohn, by two\nCatholics, Herzogenberg and Reger, Kiel and, most substantial ofall, Brahms.\n6 Einstein. Romantic music, p. 166.\n130\nMusical trends and the western church\nwhose study ofSchiitz, Gabrieli and Lotti profoundly influenced his a cappella\nmotets (notably the Fest- und Gedenkspriiche Op. 109), while his Lutheran back-\nground in the chorale, combined with his worship ofBach, emerged in motets\nsuch as Es is das Heil Op. 29 No.1 and Warum itt das Lichtgegebrn den Miihseligen\nOp. 74 No. I.\nThe debate about 'andent' and 'modern' emerged in the English theologi-\ncal and musical press dUring the ,830S and ,840S at a time wben questions were\nbeing posed about the poor standards of choral singing of cathedral founda-\ntions, depleted numbers ofboys, indisdplined men and restricted repertoire.\nVarious reformist factors effected a transformation over the next thirty years,\nthough it was from the parish and educational establishments, not the cath\u00b7\nedral, that these reforms were led. Ecclesiastical reform, spearheaded by the\nTractarian revival, ignited a huge improvement in standards of worship and\ngreater emphasis was placed on externals such as choir demeanour, dress and\nanendance. In fact the greatest enthusiasts for reform came from the Ecclesi-\nologists, who believed in a return to plainchant, the 'motet' style, new works\ncomposed in a sixteenth- and seventeenth-cenrury manner and the general\navoidance of contemporary church music. Examples of this more polemic\nreaction could be seen at Margaret Chapel (later All Saints, Margaret Street)\nand St Mark's College, Chelsea under Thomas Helmore.' For most parishes\nand collegiate institutions with musical aspirations (and lanerly cathedrals),\nthere was much less enthusiasm for chant and 'old' music; rather there was a\ndesire to see higher standards in singing, musicianship and the composition of\nnew liturgical works. In this regard, the appointments of E. 1- Hopkins al the\nTemple Church in London and T. A. Walmisley at Trinity College, Cambridge\nbecame a focus for change, as did E. G. Monk's choral services at Radley\nCollege, and Ouseley's self-financed establishment of St Michael's College,\nTenbury, intended as a model of the cathedral ideal, was perhaps tbe most\nremarkable. The most strident cry from the cathedral quarter, however, carne\nfrom S. S. Wesley with his tract Afew words on cathedral music (1849) wrinen\nin response to the suggestions by parliamenr that cathedral choirs sbould be\ndowngraded even further.\nThe Cathedrals Commission of 1852 marked a sea-change for cathedral\nmusic in England, in that, afrer much stagnation and indifference, cathedrals\nbecame central to diocesan life and, with tbe impetus provided by many\n7 See Zon, The Eng\/is1l plnitldlam revival. and Adelmann, The eontribuliol1 ofCalllbridge fede-\nsiologisLS.\n13'\nJEREMY DIBBLE\namateur parish choirs, began to invest in their choirs with a fresh vigour and\nprofessional idealism. This is perhaps best Signified by the appointment of\nJohn Stainer as organist ofSt Paul's Cathedral in 1872. Building on the teforms\nalready under way, Stainer (once Ouseley's assistant at Tenbury) honed and\nenlarged the St Paul's choir, ill-disciplined under the regime ofhis predecessor\nJohn Goss, into a well-regimented choral instrument which rapidly became\nthe paradigm for other cathedral institutions. Reforms, under Ouseley and\nSterndale Bennett, also took place in the ancient university music degrees\n\\vhose musical aspirations - ultimately to train cathedral organists - were\nclosely intertwined with the Anglican church.\nThe genres ofcathedral music at the beginning of the nineteenth century-\nthe verse anthem (for soloists and chorus), the fUll anthem (for full choir,\nsometimes with a central verse) and the service (settings of the morning and\nevening canticles and the ordinary of the mass) - showed little change from\nthose practised in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Moreover the style\nof early nineteenth-century church music was one largely formed during the\nBaroque, and this only showed signs of change with Thomas AttWood, a\nMozart pupil, and his classical anthems 'Turn thee again' (r817), 'Come, Holy\nGhost' (1831) and 'Turn thy face from my sins' (r835), the latter very much influ-\nenced by Mozart's 'Ave verum';' John Goss's anthems in abridged sonata style,\nnamely the dignified 'Ifwe believe thatJesus clied' for Wellington's state funeral\n(1852) and '0 Saviour of the world' (1869), also reveal classical thinking, The\n'learned' contrapuntal style also enjoyed some currency among English eccle-\nsiastical composers of this period, notably William Crotch, Samuel Wesley\nand Thomas Attwood Walmisley, whose Evening Service in 0 minor (1855),\nreplete with modal harmony, counterpoint and cantu.< firm\"s (based on quasi-\nplainchant), reveals an archaic style popular since the 1830S. Classicism yielded\nto an appetite for Mendelssohn and Spohr in the music of Samuel Sebastian\nWesley, undoubtedly England's most gifted composer ofthe early Victorian\nera. Wesley agitated vigorously against those who advocated the appropriate-\nness ofan'old style' in favour ofmodernism and the full assimilation ofRoman-\nticism, a view manifested in his anthems 'Blessed be the God and Father' (1834),\n'To my request and earnest cry' (c,1835), 'Let us lift up our heart' (0836) and\n'Wash me throughly' (1840) as well as the influential Service in E major (1845).\nWesley's service in particular articulated a brand of cliatonic harmony, a\nthoroughiy modern fusion of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century archaisms.\nBachian counterpoint and contemporary clissonance, that would have a\n8 See Tcmperley. 'Mozart's influence on English music'.\n132\nMusical trends and the western church\nfar-reaching effect on both his contemporaries and his successors. The opening\nof'Drop down, ye heavens, from above' (t866) by Stainer shows this harmonic\npredisposition, but also prevalent in Stainer's style, more typical of the mid-\nnineteenth cenrury, is a greater sense of theatricality and emotionalism often\nlinked with 'High Victorianism'. This is most characteristically portrayed in\nhis early anthem 'I saw the Lord' (1858), in 'Lead, kindly light' (1868) and in\nhis universally popular setting ofChtist's Passion, The Crucifixion (1887). In the\nI870S a reaction to Stainer's 'emotional' style emerged in the church music\nof Irish-born and Leipzig-educated Charles Villiers Stanford. Full of Brahms\nand Schumann, and a fervent believer in the merits of instrumental compo-\nsition, Stanford brought a symphonic and cyclic dimension to his Morning,\nCommunion and Evening Service in B flat Op. 10 in which choir and organ\nare fully integrated. The avoidance of cadence, the integral role of key, the\nsense ofcontinuing variation, and the seminal role ofthe organ are all fearures\nthat set it apart from the more episodic settings ofWesJey and Stainer. Indeed,\nthe most striking attribute of Stanford's new style is the emphasis placed on\nmusical issues - syntax, continuity and coherence - which take priority over\nthe detail of word illustration and the portrayal of theological meaning. The\nfamous Magnificat, perhaps Stanford's most enduring composition for the\nchurch, further extends the analogy of 'dance'. As a scherzo, in a clear-cut\nternaty design, it provides athorougWy original interpretation ofthe 'Song of\nMaty' with its strong differentiation of rwo robust thematic ideas. However,\nthe concept ofa scherzo formed part ofa wider scheme in which the composer\nattempted to create movements more analogous to those of the symphony.\nThis is evident in the Nunc Dimitris, a 'slow movement' full ofpathos, the Te\nDeum, a 'first movement', and the Jubilate, another dance movement. A fur-\nther dimension ofthe service is its series ofcyclic references to early Gregorian\nfragments such as the plainsong intonation of the Ambrosian Te Deum and\nthe Dresden Amen. Use of this material was designed to create a larger sense\nofcohesion across the entire service and opened up the opporrunity ofhearing\nthe service as a more expansive symphonic work as part of the Sunday liturgy.\nMore significant still, this scheme enabled Stanford's involuted musical strata\noforganicism, analogy, and thematic and tonal symbols to form a more com-\nplex ecclesiastical Gesamtkunstwerk in which elements of time, architecrural\nspace, lirurgy, music and words coalesced into an artistic entity greater than\nthe sum of its parts. Stanford repeated this with his even more symphonically\nconceived Evening Service in A Op. 10, written for St Paul's Cathedral in 1880,\nbut his masterpieces are his Service in GOp. 81 (1902), drawing on the German\nlieder tradition, and the elusively complex Service in COp. 115 (1909) which\n133\nJEREMY DIBBLE\ntransforms the 'High Victorianism' of Stainer and the dissonance of Wesley\ninto a wholly new vision of faith.\nAnglicanism led the way in English choir music, bur it was tardy in recog-\nnising the value of hymnody, though when it did, it fostered arguably the\nrichest and most popular tradition in the world. One important source of\nhymn-singing was the revival of the extensive Lutheran chorale literature\nwhich took place alongside the scholarship of early music throughout north-\nern Germany (notably Wackernagel's Das deutsche Kirch\u00a311lied von der iiltestell\nZeit bis zu A'ifang des 17,Jahrhunderts of 1864) and Scandinavia. This tradition,\nvibrant under pietist influence in the eighteenth century, inspiredJohn Wesley\nand the Methodists in England and (especially) Wales, with the result that dis\u00b7\nsenting congregations began to reject the established metrical psalmody still\npractised in Anglican parish churches, and hymns became increasingly popular\nat Sunday worship and at open-air meetings. As the use of hymnody spread,\ntwO ofits most seminal exponents, Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley, emerged as\npioneers ofthe literary art. More importantly, John Wesley's Collection ofhymns\nfor the use ofpeople called Methodists was published as the first denominational\nhymn book in 1780, indicating how quintessential hymnody had become to\nNonconformist worship. In Anglican worship metrical psalmody, invariably\nsung unaccompanied, dominated parish worship, though 'west gallery music'\nperformed by singers and instrumentalists (where the congregation would\nturn round to face the choir and musicians at the rear of the church) was also\nprevalent in some country parishes, especially in the west country; but after\na tentative beginning, with localised, parochial hynm publications, a wider\nrange of hymn books for high church and evangelical persuasions began to\nappear by the 1850S led byJ- M. Neale's The hynmailloted (185T-4), a collection of\ntranslations ofLatin hymns with music drawn mainly from plainchant, Edward\nMercer's Church psalter and hymll book (1854), Edward Bickersteth's Psalms and\nhymns based 011 the Christiall Psalmody (1858) and Catherine Winkworth's Clwrale\nbook ofEllgland (1863, with music edited by Sterndale Bennen). The culmination\nof this trend, in which there was now a major commercial interest, was HymllS\nancient &- modem (t861) edited by Henry Baker with W. H. Monk as musical edi-\ntor. This publication, more than any other, sold thousands ofcopies, was soon\nexpanded in further editions of 1868 and 1875 and helped to promulgate the\n'Victorian' hymn (now led by the choir and organ) as a universally admired.\nfashionable and distinctive artistic genre. Moreover, its success encouraged\nother denominations to publish their own 'official' hymn books with musical\neditors of stature to give their publications a sense of prestige, as revealed\nby the Church hymns (1871, edited by Sullivan), the High Anglican Hymnary\nMusical trends and the wesrern church\n(1872, edited by Barnby), the Congregational Church hymnal (1887, edited by\nE. J. Hopkins) and the Presbyterian Church Irymnary (1898, edited by Stainer)-\nIt was, however, Hymns ancienl &- modern that had the widest audience, appeal-\ning to all branches of the church with its combination ofGregorian melodies,\nchorales, eighteenth-century psalm tunes and hymns specially wrinen for the\ncollection, though it was the laner that caught the contemporary imagination.\nOf the many composers who contributed tunes - Gauntlen, Barnby, S.\nS. Wesley, Sullivan, Goss, E. J. Hopkins, H. Smart, Stainer and Dykes - it\nwas Dykes above all who seemed to encapsulate the archetypal arr form and\nwhose contributions were more abuodant than any of his contemporaries.\nMelodies such as 'Dominus regit me' ('The King oflove my shepherd is') were\nattractive for their yearning contours and sequential phrases, but what truly\ndistinguished Dykes's work was the quality of his harmony, parr-writing and\nbold structure. Dykes had been a keen Cambridge musician, a founder of the\nUniversity Musical Society, and numbered Walmisley and Ouseley among his\nmends. His innate musicaliry drew him to contemporary Romantics such as\nMendelssohn, Spohr, Schumann, Chopin and Weber. It was an assimilation\nof these continentals that found irs way into the chromatic emotionalism of\nrunes such as 'Melita' ('Eternal Father, strong to save'), 'Strength and Stay' ('0\nstrength and stay') and the'lirtle known 'Charitas' ('Lord of glory, Who hast\nbought us'), and it was Dykes's strong bass lines, suspensions, striking modu-\nlations, deft tonal recoveries and variation structures in microcosm that raised\nhis art form to a higher level. Perhaps more significantly, Dykes's expreSSive\nstyle ofhymn established a norm, which, though it provoked violent reactions\nin the next generation ofhymn book editors (such as Vaughan Williams in the\nEnglish hymnal Of1906) who either bowdlensed their chromaticisms oromined\nthem altogether, still remains one of the most widely sung examples of the\ngenre.\n9 Se.e BradJey, Abidr wirh me and Watson.
