Isotopic information can be used to make\ninferences about temperature, precipitation, or circulation\npatterns [e.g., Dansgaard et al., 1993]. Stable water isotopes\nwere first incorporated into the hydrological cycle of a\nGeneral Circulation Model (GCM) by Joussaume et al.\n[1984] and have since been included in the hydrological\ncycle of several other GCMs [e.g., Hoffmann et al., 1998;\nMathieu et al., 2002; Noone and Simmonds, 2002; Lee et\nal., 2007] in order to help interpret isotopes in paleoproxies\n[e.g., Werner et al., 2001; Vuille et al., 2003; Noone, 2008]\nand to enable more accurate model data comparison. Most\nof these GCMs have only considered the atmospheric\ncomponent of the model and have prescribed sea surface\ntemperature and sea surface isotope values. However stable\nwater isotopes have been incorporated into the GISS cou-\npled atmosphere-ocean GCM [Schmidt, 1998], and that\nmodel is now able to investigate paleoclimate events such\nas the 8.2 ka event [LeGrande et al., 2006]. As part of the\nISOMAP-UK project, stable water isotopes have been\nincorporated into the full hydrological cycle of the Hadley\nCentre Climate model, HadCM3. This is a global non-flux-\nadjusted coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM. It has been shown\nto represent a stable and realistic oceanic and atmospheric\ncirculation and climatology [Gordon et al., 2000; Sime et\nal., 2006] with an excellent match between modeled and\nobserved estimates of poleward atmospheric and oceanic\nheat transport [Cooper and Gordon, 2002; Dong and\nSutton, 2002]. This paper will describe the incorporation\nof the stable water isotopes (H2\n18O and HD16O, hereafter\nreferred to as \u2018\u2018isotopes\u2019\u2019) into the HadCM3 model and\npresent preliminary results using d18O (where d18O is\nH182 O=H\n16\n2 O\u00f0 \u00de\u0003VSMOW\nVSMOW\n\u0004 1000 and VSMOW is H218O\/H216O of\nVienna Standard Mean Ocean Water). In particular we will\nfocus on the isotopic signature of an El Nin\u02dco event and the\nrelationship between tropical precipitation and d18O of\nprecipitation (hereafter referred to as d18Op).\n[3] Present-day spatial correlations between d18Op and\nclimate variables show that d18Op is most strongly correlated\nwith temperature at high latitudes and most strongly corre-\nlated with precipitation amount in the tropics [Dansgaard,\n1964]. The spatial relationship between precipitation\namount and d18Op (known as the spatial \u2018\u2018amount effect\u2019\u2019)\nhas been discussed by a number of modeling studies\nincluding Mathieu et al. [2002] and Lee et al. [2007].\nHowever, these studies have correlated d18Op with precip-\nitation amount over the tropical oceans (20\u0001N\u201320\u0001S), and\nthe regressions they find do not apply over the land where\nmost paleoarchives of d18Op occur. Here we consider the\nspatial amount effect in more detail to try and increase the\nunderstanding of how d18Op is related to precipitation\namount over the tropical ocean and land surface.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 114, D04111, doi:10.1029\/2008JD010825, 2009\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Bristol Research Initiative for the Dynamic Global Environment,\nSchool of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.\n2British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK.\nCopyright 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/09\/2008JD010825$09.00\nD04111 1 of 12\n[4] The El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the\nsingle most important determinant of interannual variability\nin global precipitation fields [Dai et al., 1997], yet it has not\nbeen fully investigated by other isotope enabled GCMs.\nPrevious work, using isotope enabled atmospheric GCMs\n[Hoffmann et al., 1998; Noone and Simmonds, 2002] found\nthat the interannual, temporal correlation between precipi-\ntation and d18Op reached a maximum over the central\nPacific where the ENSO signal dominates, suggesting an\nENSO imprint on d18Op. Schmidt et al. [2007] considered\nthe isotopic signal of ENSO using the fully coupled GISS\nmodel and found the leading EOF of tropical SST variance\nto be correlated with d18Op with regressions consistent with\nobservations. A more complete investigation of ENSO\nwas conducted by Brown et al. [2006], who coupled their\nisotope enabled AGCM to an interactive isotope ocean box\nmodel in order to investigate the imprint of El Nin\u02dco on the\nd18O of sea water (d18Osw) and of corals. Correlations\nbetween the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and d18Op\nwere at a maximum over the central Pacific, and a similar\ncorrelation pattern was found between SOI and d18Osw.\nTheir estimates of coral d18O were in reasonable agreement\nwith observations at sites where precipitation was well\nsimulated.\n[5] HadCM3 includes water isotopes in a fully coupled\nsystem and has been shown to simulate ENSO as well as\nother current generation coupled models, with an amplitude\nand frequency that is broadly in agreement with observa-\ntions [Collins et al., 2001; Latif et al., 2001; AchutaRao and\nSperber, 2002]. The model is therefore in a unique position\nto investigate the isotopic signal of ENSO. Following\nBrown et al. [2006], we also consider the relationship of\nENSO to d18Op, d\n18Osw and d\n18O of corals, using the fully\ncoupled model. In addition we use the climate anomaly\nassociated with El Nin\u02dco to investigate the spatial amount\neffect more fully and suggest ways in which the spatial\ncorrelation between precipitation amount and d18Op can be\nincreased.\n[6] The new coupled atmosphere-ocean isotope model is\ndescribed in section 2, and validated against present-day\nobservations in section 3. Section 4 investigates the isotopic\nresponse to ENSO for the present-day climate, and section 5\nconsiders the spatial amount effect. Results are summarized\nin section 6.\n2. Model Description\n[7] HadCM3 is a state of the art GCM that has been used\nin numerous scientific studies including the latest IPCC\nreport. It is composed of two main components: an atmo-\nspheric component (HadAM3) and an oceanic component\n(HadOM3). These components can either be coupled to-\ngether (as HadCM3) or run separately. Isotopes have been\nadded to the full hydrological cycle of HadCM3 as de-\nscribed in the sections below. Here, it is worth noting that\nthe different structure of HadAM3 and HadOM3 makes it\nnecessary to use different techniques to incorporate isotopes\ninto the two models. In particular, HadAM3 models water\nexplicitly and so two new water species (to represent H2\n18O\nand HD16O) have been explicitly added to this model. In\ncontrast, HadOM3, assumes a fixed volume of water in each\nmodel grid box which means that isotopes must be included\nas a tracer (in the same way as salinity) with each isotope\nspecies making up a fraction of each model grid box.\n2.1. Atmospheric Model\n[8] The atmospheric component of the Hadley Centre\nmodel (HadAM3) has been described by Pope et al. [2000].\nIt is a hydrostatic grid point model using an Arakawa B grid\nand hybrid vertical coordinates. The horizontal resolution is\n3.75\u0001 \u0004 2.5\u0001, there are 19 vertical levels and 30 minutes\ntime steps. The model uses a conservative split-explicit\nintegration scheme with fourth-order horizontal advection\nas described by Cullen and Davies [1991]; such that the\nadvection of water vapor and its isotopes depend upon their\nspatial gradients. Although this scheme leads to realistic\nresults for both H2\n16O and H2\n18O, it was able to cause some\nunrealistically large or small values of d18Op because of\nsmall discrepancies between the gradients of the two water\nspecies. This problem is not unique to HadCM3 and has\nalso occurred in other models, here it was overcome in the\nway suggested by Mathieu et al. [2002] for the GENESIS\nGCM, namely by redistributing isotopic mass to surround-\ning grid boxes when the advection scheme caused a large\nand physically unrealistic change in atmospheric d18O.\n2.1.1. Surface Evaporation\n[9] In HadAM3, evaporation from the ocean surface is\nproportional to the difference between the saturated specific\nhumidity at the surface and the specific humidity at the\nlowest atmospheric layer and includes both equilibrium\nand kinetic fractionation [Merlivat and Jouzel, 1979]. When\ncalculating kinetic fractionation we use the diffusivities\nsuggested by Cappa et al. [2003] which are more realistic.\nSea ice is represented in the model and is either prescribed\n(HadAM3) or calculated by the oceanic component\n(HadCM3). Because of the slow diffusivity of heavy isotope\nspecies within ice, sublimation from sea ice is assumed to\nbe nonfractionating.\n[10] Many isotope enabled models use a \u2018\u2018bucket\u2019\u2019 scheme\nto represent the land surface [e.g., Mathieu et al., 2002;\nNoone and Simmonds, 2002] where precipitation minus\nevaporation minus runoff fills a shallow top layer while\nany overflow fills a lower layer of infinite capacity. These\nmodels make assumptions about the vegetation type at the\nsurface and there is limited scope for interpreting isotopes\nwithin the surface hydrology. Recently, however, the GISS\nmodel has included water isotopes in a more sophisticated\nland surface scheme [Aleinov and Schmidt, 2006]. The\nintroduction of isotopes into an advanced land surface\nscheme has been shown by Fischer [2006] to provide a\nnew useful means of investigating and characterizing land\nsurface behavior. Further, Fischer [2006] notes that the\nbucket schemes used in some models fail to reproduce the\nisotopic partitioning of a more complex land surface scheme.\nThe land surface scheme used in HadCM3 is the MOSES2\nland surface exchange scheme and includes the sophisticated\nTRIFFID dynamic vegetation model [Cox et al., 1999].\nMOSES2\/TRIFFID uses several surface types (broadleaf\ntrees, needleleaf trees, shrubs, C4 grass, C3 grass, bare soil,\nurban, water and snow\/ice), which each make up a fraction\nof every grid box. There are 4 soil levels. Each surface type\ninteracts with the climate and vegetation structure dynam-\nically adjusts throughout a long model run. Precipitation\nwill either be intercepted by the canopy, treated as runoff or\nD04111 TINDALL ET AL.: ISOTOPES IN HADCM3\n2 of 12\nD04111\nabsorbed into the soil. Despite all these potential complex-\nities, the isotopes are treated in a relatively simple way in\nthe land surface scheme: there is no fractionation during\nevaporation from the vegetated land surface [Zimmermann\net al., 1967], during sublimation from ice (due to the slow\ndiffusivities of H2\n18O and HD16O in ice), or when exchanging\nwater between adjacent soil layers. Although Aleinov and\nSchmidt [2006] suggested that evaporation from bare soil\nshould fractionate, this fractionation is not currently included\nin HadCM3; however since evaporation from soil is typically\nonly 10% of total evaporation its omission should have only\na small impact on the overall results. Condensation as dew is\nconsidered to be non fractionating as this evaporates very\nrapidly, condensation onto snow includes kinetic fraction-\nation analogous to that used when forming ice clouds as is\ndescribed in the next section.\n2.1.2. Condensation and Postcondensation Processes\n[11] There are two condensation schemes in HadCM3,\none which deals with large-scale nonconvective clouds and\nanother which deals with convective clouds. The large-scale\ncloud scheme is based on Smith [1990] with modifications\ndescribed by Gregory and Morris [1996]. This scheme\ncontains prognostic variables for liquid water and ice clouds,\nand allows for mixed phase clouds when the temperature is\nbetween \u00039\u0001C and 0\u0001C. Clouds only form in those grid\nboxes which have relative humidity greater than a critical\nlevel of 70%. Liquid condensate is formed in isotopic\nequilibrium with the surrounding vapor, while the formation\nof frozen condensate includes a kinetic process due to the\ndiffusion of isotopes around the oversaturated zone sur-\nrounding ice crystals. This kinetic process depends on a\nsupersaturation function, Si, which is taken to be a linear\nfunction of temperature (T [Jouzel and Merlivat, 1984]).\nThe parameterization of Si is not well constrained by data\n[Jouzel, 1986] and was originally taken to be Si = 1\u00030.003T\n[Jouzel et al., 1987], but more recently work [Schmidt\net al., 2005; Lee et al., 2007] has increased the depen-\ndence of Si on temperature to Si = 1 \u0003 0.004T. Here we\nuse Si = 1 \u0003 0.005T; the value of Si does not have a\ndiscernible effect on d18Op, but does allow for some\ntuning of the deuterium excess.\n[12] Precipitation from stratiform clouds is assumed to\nform slowly and so it is assumed [Hoffmann et al., 1998]\nthat 95% of the precipitation reaches isotopic equilibrium\nwith the vapor as it passes through lower layers. This means\nthat the isotopic ratios at the lowest atmospheric levels\n(which are more strongly influenced by evaporation) will\nhave the largest influence on the isotopic value of falling\nliquid precipitation. This is in agreement with the results of\nLee et al. [2007] who quantified the importance of evapo-\nration in determining d18Op and showed that a Rayleigh\ndistillation process alone was inadequate. Frozen conden-\nsate does not exchange with the surrounding vapor because\nof the low diffusivities of H2\n18O and HD16O in ice. There is\nalso no fractionation between H2\n18O and HD16O on melting,\nfreezing or sublimation [Jouzel, 1986].\n[13] The convection scheme in HadCM3 is as described\nby Gregory and Rowntree [1990] but with the addition of\nconvective downdrafts. Convective clouds form quickly and\nprecipitate quickly meaning that they are not treated the\nsame as large-scale clouds. Convective clouds are formed in\nisotopic equilibrium with surrounding vapor; the fraction-\nation factors corresponding to the vapor-liquid phase transi-\ntion is used for temperatures greater than \u000320\u0001C otherwise\nthe vapor-solid phase transition is used. There has been\nsome disagreement whether there should be a kinetic\nfractionation associated with the formation of convective\nice clouds. For example the GENESIS model follows the\nsuggestion of Federer et al. [1982] and does not include\nkinetic fractionation in the formation of ice clouds; however\nother isotope enabled GCMs follow Jouzel and Merlivat\n[1984] and include kinetic fractionation in the formation\nof ice clouds. Here we follow the methodology imple-\nmented in the majority of other GCMs and use kinetic\nfractionation, however we note that it will generally make\nlittle difference whether or not kinetic fractionation is\nincluded because of the effect of postcondensation processes\nand the fact that convective precipitation generally falls as\nliquid. As convective precipitation falls through lower\nlayers there will be some exchange between condensate\nand vapor, however the precipitation falls more quickly and\ndrops are larger than associated with large-scale precipita-\ntion and so the condensate does not have time to equilibrate\nfully with the surrounding vapor. Following Hoffmann et al.\n[1998] we assume that 45% of liquid convective precipita-\ntion reaches equilibrium with the surrounding air. Below the\ncloud base the air is unsaturated and any liquid precipitation\nwill start to evaporate. Since this process can occur rapidly\na kinetic isotope effect (described by Stewart [1975]) is\nrequired. This kinetic effect is proportional to 1 \u0003 h, where\nh is the relative humidity, and so is more apparent at dry sites.\nJouzel et al. [1987] noted that as raindrops evaporate the air\nwill become gradually more saturated and so the influence of\nthis kinetic effect decreases during the course of the precip-\nitation event. For simplicity, and following Jouzel et al.\n[1987], the kinetic fractionation is calculated using a con-\nstant effective relative humidity heff, (heff = 0.75 + 0.25hi;\nhi is the initial relative humidity) which takes into account\nthe changing relative humidity over the course of the\nprecipitation event.\n2.2. Ocean\n[14] The oceanic component of HadCM3, HadOM3, is a\nstandard \u2018\u2018rigid lid\u2019\u2019 barotropic model. It is based on the\nGFDL \u2018\u2018Cox\u2019\u2019 ocean model with modifications as described\nby Gordon et al. [2000]. The standard HadCM3 horizontal\nresolution is 1.25\u0001 \u0004 1.25\u0001, with 20 oceanic levels and\n1 h time steps. HadCM3 does not require oceanic flux\ncorrection; however, since there is no representation of\niceberg calving, a small prescribed water flux is returned\nto the ocean to balance the net accumulation of snowfall\non the ice sheets. This water flux is converted to surface\nsalinity fluxes using a constant reference salinity of 35 PSU.\n[15] Since the HadCM3 ocean is represented by a rigid\nlid model the volume of the ocean is fixed and cannot be\naltered by water fluxes due to evaporation, precipitation or\nrunoff. Pardaens et al. [2003] describe how water fluxes in\nHadCM3 are converted to a virtual salt flux such that the\nsalinity of the top level of the ocean changes with freshwater\ninputs and the freshwater budget is conserved. The isotope\nbudget is conserved in a similar way: water fluxes to the\nocean (due to H2\n16O in evaporation, precipitation and runoff)\nand isotope fluxes to the ocean (due to H2\n18O in evaporation,\nprecipitation and runoff) are converted to a virtual isotope\nD04111 TINDALL ET AL.: ISOTOPES IN HADCM3\n3 of 12\nD04111\nflux, analogous to the virtual salt flux. This virtual isotope\nflux alters the H2\n18O\/H2\n16O ratio in the top level of the ocean\nby an amount consistent with the water and isotope fluxes\nfrom the atmosphere and land surface.\n[16] The isotopic tracers are mixed horizontally, using the\nversion of the Gent and McWilliams [1990] scheme, which\nis incorporated into HadCM3. HadCM3 also comprises a\nsimple sea ice model, this is based on the zero-layer model\nof Semtner [2006] and includes ice drifts, leads and snow\ncover. Ice is advected by the surface ocean current, with\nconvergence prevented when the depth exceeds 4 m [Cattle\nand Crossley, 1995]. It has been shown to produce a\nrealistic representation of ice extent by Gregory et al.\n[2002]. Ice processes are included in the new isotope\nscheme in the simplest possible way, since our first\npriority was the conservation of the isotope budgets. No\nfractionation is included when ice forms from ocean water,\nwhen ice melts, when the overlying snow melts or on\nsublimation. It is noted that a small fractionation should be\nincluded in sea ice formation for maximum accuracy\n[Pfirman et al., 2004].\n[17] Although HadCM3 does not require heat flux cor-\nrection, a small water flux, which represents iceberg calving,\nis required to close the global hydrological cycle. Since\niceberg calving also introduces H2\n18O into the ocean a small\nisotope flux is also required. This isotope flux was pre-\nscribed with d18O = \u000330% relative to the water flux, which\nis a reasonable estimate of d18O in high latitude sea ice.\nHowever since the isotope flux was not calculated directly\nfrom the model a very small drift in ocean isotopes remains.\nThe drift is not large enough to affect the results of the\ncentury-scale simulations shown here and will be corrected\nat a later date.\n[18] In order to allow a longer control run for analysis this\npaper uses HadCM3L: a version of HadCM3 with reduced\noceanic horizontal resolution of 3.75\u0001 \u0004 2.5\u0001. The setup of\nHadCM3L is identical to that of HadCM3 except that the\nreduced ocean resolution requires a minor adjustment of the\nland-sea mask to maintain the present-day thermohaline\ncirculation.\n3. Validation: Present-Day Model-Data\nComparison\n[19] The isotope enabled version of HadAM3, has\npreviously been considered by Sime et al. [2008] who\nshowed that the geographical pattern of modeled present-\nday Antarctic d18Op provided a goodmatch with 20th century\nd18O Antarctic surface snow [Masson-Delmotte et al., 2008].\nHere we compare results from a 200 year preindustrial,\nHadCM3L control run with d18O from a number of sources,\nto assess the simulation of d18O both spatially and temporally.\nThe control run was prescribed CO2 of 280 ppmv and CH4 of\n760 ppbv. d18Owas initialized to 0% over the ocean and in the\nland surface and \u000340% in snow and ice. The annual mean\nd18Op from the model is compared with observations in\nFigure 1, where Figure 1a shows d18Op averaged over the last\n10 years of the control simulation and Figure 1b shows d18Op\nprovided by the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation\n(GNIP) observational database. The GNIP data is limited to\nthose stations which contain a full annual cycle of observa-\ntions, further information about GNIP can be found at\nhttp:\/\/www-naweb.iaea.org\/napc\/ih\/GNIP\/HIS_GNIP.html.\nThe modeled results compare well with GNIP over most of\nthe globe, although the scarcity of the observations makes a\nfull comparison difficult. The four standard determinants of\nd18Op are clearly visible in Figure 1a: the amount effect over\nthe tropical oceans with d18Op more depleted over wetter\nregions, the temperature effect at higher latitudes with d18Op\nmore depleted over the colder regions, the continentality\neffect with d18Op more depleted further from its ocean\nsource and the altitude effect with d18Op more depleted at\nhigher altitudes. These features have been seen in other\nmodels and are described in detail by Mathieu et al. [2002].\n[20] Although overall the isotopemodel compares well with\nobservations, the modeled d18Op over tropical continents is\nFigure 1. Comparison between HadCM3L and GNIP.

Hoffmann et al. [1998] suggested\nincluding a global enrichment of the ocean surface of 0.5%\nwhen calculating the evaporation from the ocean; this\nenrichment was included in an early version of our model\nand initially resulted in greater agreement between tropical\nd18Op from the model and tropical d\n18Op from GNIP\n(although the global enrichment alone was not sufficient\nto explain the full discrepancy over the tropical continents).\nHowever, this isotopic enrichment led to an additional\nexport of H2\n18O from, and thusmore depletedH2\n18O remaining\nin, those regions with high evaporation. Over the longer\nterm this led to a large mismatch between modeled d18Osw\nand observed d18Osw, a consequence which would not be\napparent in an atmosphere only model such as that used by\nHoffmann et al. [1998]. The global enrichment has not been\nincluded in the current version of HadCM3 and hence the\ntropical values of d18Op are more depleted than they would\notherwise have been. The tropical continental d18Op is also\ntoo depleted in the NCAR model [Lee et al., 2007], where it\nhas been attributed to inaccuracies in the modeled climate.\nThe HadCM3 climate is in reasonable agreement with\nobservations [e.g., Johns et al., 2003], and there is no\nsystematic precipitation bias between HadCM3L and GNIP\nover the tropics (not shown). This suggests it is unlikely\nthat the negative d18Op bias in HadCM3 can be fully\nexplained by inaccuracies in the modeled climate. Since the\ndiscrepancies are larger over land there may be some issues\nwith the hydrology or the treatment of isotopes within the\nland surface scheme.\n[21] Figures 1c and 1d show the long-term mean\nseasonality (DJF-JJA) of d18Op, for HadCM3L and the GNIP\nobservations respectively. Again a scarcity of data points\nmakes a full comparison difficult; however there appears to\nbe very good agreement between the model and the data\neverywhere, even over the tropical continents where the\nmodeled annual average d18Op was too depleted. It has been\nargued that the relationship between d18Op and climate over\nthe seasonal cycle might be useful for paleoclimatic applica-\ntions because different climate forcings occur at different\ntimes of the year [Siegenthaler and Oeschger, 1980]. If this is\nthe case than the good agreement between model and data\nseasonal cycles in Figure 1 supports the use of the model for\npaleoclimate applications throughout the globe. However,\nRozanski et al. [1992] suggested that the interannual rela-\ntionship between d18Op and climate parameters would be\nmore appropriate for paleoclimatic reconstructions.\n[22] Many GNIP stations provide isotopic measurements\nfrom a small number of years, and so provide little informa-\ntion about the interannual variability of d18Op. The following\nanalysis is therefore limited to those GNIP stations which\ncontain more than 20 years of data. To investigate the\ninterannual variability of d18Op in the model the interannual\nstandard deviation was calculated from precipitation weighted\nannual d18Op for each GNIP station and the corresponding\nmodel grid box. This is shown in Figure 2. Generally the\nstandard deviation from GNIP is larger than that calculated\nby the model. This is reasonable since GNIP stations\nrepresent d18Op over a spatially small sample site while the\nmodel represents d18Op over a large grid box. The modeled\nvariability is similar to the GNIP variability at mid and high\nlatitudes where d18Op is related to temperature, while the\nmodeled variability is much smaller than the GNIP variability\nFigure 2.

Perhaps this is because precipitation is spatially\nmore noisy than temperature, and so spatial smoothing of\nprecipitation over a large model grid box would reduce the\nmodeled variability of d18Op relative to the data in those\nregions where d18Op is related to precipitation amount.\n[23] Although the present-day interannual comparison\nwith GNIP is important, it is also important to compare\nisotope information from the model to longer-term data,\nsuch as that provided by ice cores. Here we briefly compare\nd18Op from the 200 year HadCM3 control simulation to the\nlast 200 years of ice core data obtained from various stations\naround the globe. The ice core data used is publicly available\nat the National Climatic Data Center.\n[24] Figure 3 compares model results and ice core data\nfor the mean d18O and interannual standard deviation of\nd18O. In each case the light gray bar represents the ice core\ndata while the black bar represents the model data. There is\ngood agreement between mean d18O from the data and the\nmodel, however, where a discrepancy does exist it is nearly\nalways the data that is more depleted. The largest discrepancy\noccurs over Mount Logan (61\u0001N, 140\u0001W)where the data is\n\u000314% more depleted than the model. This is probably due\nto the \u2018\u2018altitude effect\u2019\u2019 as Mount Logan is not large enough\nto cover a whole model grid box and so while the data was\ntaken from a point 5340 m high the model grid box altitude\nis only 1080 m. Mount Logan is also the ice core which has\nthe largest discrepancy between model and data in standard\ndeviation, again this could be due to the model being unable\nto accurately resolve small-scale orography.\n[25] The model and ice cores are reasonably consistent in\nstandard deviation; however the Greenland sites generally\nhave higher standard deviation in the model while the\ntropical sites generally have higher standard deviation in\nthe ice cores. Assuming both model and data are accurate,\ndifferences between the two are likely to represent the effects\nof comparing a large model grid box to a site point and of\nlarger postdeposition isotope diffusion in the high latitude\nlower accumulation rate ice cores. These factors have\nopposing influences; the differences in scale (which would\nFigure 3. A comparison between the modeled d18Op and ice core data.

Together these\nfactors can explain at least some of the discrepancies\nbetween the model and ice core standard deviation. It is\nalso noted that there are some important areas of agreement\nin the standard deviation of model and ice cores: the relative\nsize of standard deviation between different Greenland\nsites is consistent between model and ice cores and there\nis remarkable agreement between model and data over\nAntarctica.\n[26] Since HadCM3, is a coupled ocean-atmosphere GCM\nit is appropriate to consider the mean isotopic signal at the\nocean surface. Figure 4 shows the d18Osw, averaged over the\ntop 50 m of the ocean from the last 10 years of the\nHadCM3L control simulation (Figure 4a) and the LeGrande\nand Schmidt [2006] gridded data set based on observations\n(Figure 4b). It can be seen that the modeled values are very\nsimilar to the gridded observations over most of the globe,\nhowever there are some discrepancies. Over some regions of\nthe tropics modeled d18Osw is too depleted, this is particu-\nlarly apparent near Australia, and is likely due to the fact that\nd18Op is too depleted in these regions (see Figure 1). In\naddition the model is more depleted than the gridded\nobservations over some coastal regions, particularly eastern\nAsia and North Eastern Canada. The depleted modeled\nd18Osw in coastal regions is a result of the continental runoff\nof d18Op mixing with the ocean waters. Further development\nand tuning of the runoff scheme may improve the repre-\nsentation of isotopes in d18Osw although this is beyond the\nscope of this study.\n[27] This section has shown that the isotopic scheme in\nHadCM3 is reasonable when compared with much of the\ndata available, for both d18Op and d\n18Osw. This gives\nconfidence in our use of the isotope model to investigate\nthe El Nin\u02dco\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) coupled ocean-\natmosphere climate phenomenon, which will allow further\nassessment of the isotope model. In addition, the recon-\nstruction of modes of climate variability (such as ENSO)\nis often a goal of paleoclimate reconstructions, these\nreconstructions would be aided by model simulations of\nisotope responses to large-scale climate variability.\n4. ENSO, d18O, and the Tropical Amount Effect\n[28] El Nin\u02dco events were identified in the model simula-\ntion using the definition of Trenberth [1997] for the NINO3\nregion (90\u2013150\u0001W and 5\u0001N\u20135\u0001S). First, monthly mean\nSST\u2019s anomalies were calculated and a 5 month running\nmean applied. Anomalies, in the resulting time series,\ngreater than 0.5\u0001C for more than 6 months were categorized\nas \u2018\u2018El Nin\u02dco,\u2019\u2019 while anomalies less than \u00030.5\u0001C for more\nthan 6 months were categorized as \u2018\u2018La Nin\u02dca.\u2019\u2019 The NINO3\nregion was used instead of the NINO3.4 region as this is the\nlocation of the largest interannual SST variability in the\nstandard HadCM3 model [Brown et al., 2008]; although\nsensitivity tests (not shown) indicate that using the\nNINO3.4 region does not give significantly different results.\nEl Nin\u02dco and La Nin\u02dca states of the model were than combined\ninto El Nin\u02dco and La Nin\u02dca composites. The composites\nrepresented annual average conditions and so each El Nin\u02dco\nmonth in the control simulation was weighted by the\nlikelihood of an El Nin\u02dco in that calendar month to account\nfor the fact that El Nin\u02dco is more prevalent in the NH winter.\n[29] Figure 5 shows the El Nin\u02dco composite anomaly rela-\ntive to the long-term mean climate. Generally the La Nin\u02dca\nanomalies are the inverse of El Nin\u02dco anomalies, and so the\ndiscussion that follows will describe the El Nin\u02dco anomalies\nonly. Figure 5a shows the warm surface temperature anom-\naly, in the central Pacific and along the western coast of\nSouth America, which characterizes the El Nin\u02dco state of the\nclimate. Precipitation anomalies associated with El Nin\u02dco are\nshown in Figure 5b. It can be seen that there is increased\nprecipitation associated with El Nin\u02dco across the full breadth\nof the Pacific Ocean. For the most part, the precipitation\nanomalies compare well with observations [Dai and Wigley,\n2000; Spencer and Slingo, 2003], however the model fails\nto simulate the dry conditions of El Nin\u02dco that occur in the\nwestern Pacific warm pool. This could be due to the fact\nthat the Gregory and Rowntree [1990] convection scheme is\nclosed on the buoyancy of the near surface air, causing\nregions of largest precipitation anomalies to occur over the\nregions of largest SST anomalies [Spencer and Slingo,\n2003].\n[30] Figure 5c shows the d18Op anomaly for El Nin\u02dco. As\nexpected, this is clearly related to the precipitation anomaly,\nwith depleted d18Op over areas of increased precipitation\nand enriched d18Op over areas of decreased precipitation.\nThe d18Op signal is much noisier than the precipitation\nsignal, partly because Figure 5b is dominated by \u2018\u2018wet\u2019\u2019\nregions which have greatest potential for a large precipitation\nFigure 4. Mean d18Osw for the top 50 m of the ocean\nsurface: (a) an average of the last 10 years of the 200 year\nHadCM3L control simulation and (b) Legrande and\nSchmidt [2006] gridded data set based on observations.\nD04111 TINDALL ET AL.: ISOTOPES IN HADCM3\n7 of 12\nD04111\nchange (in mm\/month). A weighted precipitation anomaly\n(Figure 5d) is therefore also included, which shows the\npercentage change in rainfall between the composite El Nin\u02dco\nand the long-term mean. More precipitation anomalies are\nvisible when the anomalies are weighted and there are\nsome improvements in the correlation between d18Op and\nprecipitation amount (e.g., South Atlantic). A comparison\nbetween Figures 5c and 5d suggests that most tropical d18Op\nanomalies are related to precipitation anomalies; although\nthere is sometimes a spatial shift between the two variables\nconsistent with the effects of the upstream rainout on d18Op.\nGiven the clear relationship between d18Op and precipitation,\nit follows any errors in precipitation associated with El Nin\u02dco,\nwill likely propagate to errors in d18Op.\n[31] Figure 6a shows the d18Osw anomaly associated with\nEl Nin\u02dco. As expected the oceanic effect is largest in coastal\nregions, where the shallow mixed layer depth, and increased\nmixing due to surface runoff, allow interannual changes in\nprecipitation to be seen in the ocean. In contrast, Brown\net al. [2006] found the largest El Nin\u02dco d18Osw signal in the\ncentral Pacific, however their rather simple model did not\ninclude runoff. The El Nin\u02dco, d18Osw anomaly is particularly\npronounced in the Southwest Pacific; this was discussed\nby Tudhope et al. [1995] who found enriched d18Osw\nassociated with El Nin\u02dco in this region. Unfortunately the\nmodel fails to reproduce the reduced precipitation and\nenriched d18Op in this region, and hence the d\n18Osw signal,\nwhilst being consistent with the model physics and of a\nsimilar magnitude to observations, is not of the same sign.\n[32] The modeled SST and d18Osw El Nin\u02dco anomalies\nwere combined to estimate the d18O El Nin\u02dco anomaly that\nFigure 5.

The red letters denote the locations of\nthe observational sites at Mahe Island (site A), Madang (site\nB), and Maiana Island (site C) that are discussed in the text.\nD04111 TINDALL ET AL.: ISOTOPES IN HADCM3\n8 of 12\nD04111\nwould be seen in coral data. This was done using the\nempirical relationship derived by Juillet-Leclerc and\nSchmidt [2001]: d18Ocoral = d\n18Osw + (0.2 \u0004 SST) + 0.45\nand is shown in Figure 6b. The empirical relationship was\ndeveloped using Porites coral from a large number of\ncolonies collected from different sites over the temperature\nrange 24\u0001\u201330\u0001C. Figure 6b shows that d18O of coral is\nrelated to SST over most of the ocean and to d18Osw in\ncoastal regions. Highlighted in Figure 6b are three coral\nsites, data from which will be compared with the modeled\nresults. The sites are: Maha Island in the Indian Ocean (site\nA [Charles et al., 1997]), Madang in the Western Pacific\n(site B [Tudhope et al., 2001]) and Maiana Island in the\nCentral Pacific (site C [Urban et al., 2000]). These sites\nhave previously been compared with an isotope model by\nBrown et al. [2006].\n[33] Table 1 compares modeled coral d18O and observed\ncoral d18O for the three sites. The comparison is made for\nEl Nin\u02dco anomalies relative to both the long-term mean and\nthe La Nin\u02dca composite. The observed El Nin\u02dco and La Nin\u02dca\nwere obtained, on the basis of the NINO3 index, in the same\nway as calculated for the model. It can be seen that\nthe modeled d18O coral anomaly is similar to the observed\nanomaly at both Mahe Island (Indian Ocean) and Maiana\nIsland (Central Pacific), especially when we note that the\nmodeled results are not intended to represent any particular\ncalendar years and that the observed results will contain\nEl Nin\u02dco and La Nin\u02dca events of a different magnitude to\nthose in the model. The modeled coral d18O anomalies at\nMadang are not in good agreement with observations, again\nbecause of the error in simulating El Nin\u02dco precipitation over\nthe Western Pacific.\n[34] Despite the poor agreement between model and data\nat Madang, it is still useful to assess the relative importance\nof SST and d18Osw to coral d\n18O in this region. The model\nsuggests that SST changes contribute only about one third of\nthe coral d18O anomalies at Madang; this means that the\nmodel results agree with Tudhope et al. [1995] in the sense\nthat the coral anomalies due to El Nin\u02dco are predominantly\nan indication of d18Osw in this region. In contrast, at Mahe\nand Maiana, d18Osw typically contributes about 10% of the\ncoral d18O, implying that the ENSO signal here reflects\nchanges in SST; in agreement with observations at Mahe\nIsland [Charles et al., 1997].\n5. Spatial \u2018\u2018Amount Effect\u2019\u2019\n[35] One feature that is typical of isotope enabled GCMs\nis that the correlation between precipitation amount and\nd18Op is larger in the models than in the observations; this\nappears to be the case for spatial correlations [e.g., Lee et\nal., 2007; Mathieu et al., 2002] and for interannual temporal\ncorrelations [Cole et al., 1999; Hoffmann et al., 1998].\nAlthough this discrepancy could be due to a systematic error\nthere is the possibility that both the model and the data are\ncorrect. Observations over the Andean region [Hoffmann\net al., 2003] and model results [Schmidt et al., 2007] suggest\nthat d18Op provides a record of large-scale regional\nprecipitation rather than local precipitation. If indeed this is\nthe case then d18Op would be more strongly correlated with\nprecipitation over a large model grid box than with\nprecipitation at a small observation site. It is therefore appro-\npriate to consider the modeled amount effect in more detail.\n[36] Mathieu et al. [2002] considered the spatial amount\neffect over the tropical oceans (20\u0001N\u201320\u0001S) for a 3 year run\nof their GCM. They found the least squares regression slope\nbetween d18Op and precipitation to be \u00031.14%\/(mm\/a), and\nnoted that this was not significantly different from obser-\nvations. The least squares regression slope from HadCM3 is\nalso \u00031.14%\/(mm\/a) and has r2 = 0.56. The correlation\nbetween d18Op and precipitation amount over the tropical\noceans is interesting theoretically but has limited practical\napplications for oceanic paleoproxies. Oceanic paleoprox-\nies, such as corals, will provide information about d18Osw\nand SST and cannot be translated to precipitation amount\nusing this relationship. Paleoproxies over the land (such as\ntree rings and ice cores) can provide information about\nprecipitation amount, however precipitation amount and\nd18Op are less correlated over land; for example including\ntropical land points into the regression from HadCM3\nreduces r2 from 0.56 to 0.30.\n[37] It will now be considered whether there is a more\nrobust spatial correlation between tropical d18Op and\ntropical precipitation amount when both can be attributed\nto a consistent source (e.g., an El Nin\u02dco event) instead of when\nthe two variables are obtained from climatological means.\nFigure 5 suggests that the El Nin\u02dco precipitation anomaly is\nrelated to the El Nin\u02dco d18Op anomaly and that the relationship\nis stronger when the precipitation difference is expressed as a\npercentage change rather than in mm\/month. This is con-\nfirmed quantitatively in Figure 7 which shows r2 calculated\nfrom precipitation anomalies and d18Op anomalies for\ndifferent latitude bands of the globe. r2 values have been\nobtained using precipitation changes expressed both as a\npercentage and in mm\/month for the El Nin\u02dco minus the\nlong-term mean climate, the La Nin\u02dca minus the long-term\nmean climate and the El Nin\u02dco minus the La Nin\u02dca climate.\nFigure 7 shows that for all latitude bands and for all\nclimate anomalies, precipitation and d18Op are much\nstronger correlated when precipitation change is expressed\nas a percentage. This improvement is substantial, for\nexample within the latitudes 20\u0001N\u201320\u0001S, approximately\ntwice the precipitation variability can be explained by\nd18Op variability when precipitation change is expressed as\na percentage and large improvements are also seen in other\nlatitude bands.\nTable 1.

EN-LTM is the difference between the El Nin\u02dco composite and the long-term mean climate, and EN-LN is the difference\nbetween the El Nin\u02dco composite and the La Nin\u02dca composite.\nD04111 TINDALL ET AL.: ISOTOPES IN HADCM3\n9 of 12\nD04111\n[38] Figure 8 shows the spatial relationship between\nprecipitation amount and d18Op and how this differs be-\ntween ocean grid boxes (black crosses) and land grid boxes\n(red crosses). While the spatial variability in the El Nin\u02dco\nanomalies (Figures 8a and 8b) is dominated by ocean points\nthe land points appear consistent with the ocean regressions.\nThough we note that when the mm\/month change in\nprecipitation is used (Figure 8b) the simple linear spatial\nrelationship between precipitation and d18Op breaks down\nboth over the land and the ocean. Figure 8c shows however,\nthat when considering annual average values, the spatial\nrelationship between precipitation amount and d18Op is\ninconsistent between the land and the ocean grid cells. This\nis probably why some previous studies which have given\nregression results for the spatial precipitation amount effect\n[e.g., Mathieu et al., 2002] have limited their analysis to\noceanic grid boxes only.\n[39] Figure 8 suggests that there is a simple spatial\nrelationship between d18Op anomalies and precipitation\nanomalies over land points for the El Nin\u02dco composite\nrelative to the long-term mean. For land points, if\nprecipitation anomalies are expressed as a percentage change\nthen r2 = 0.29 for 10\u0001N\u201310\u0001S and r2 = 0.24 for\n20\u0001N\u201320\u0001S. If precipitation anomalies are expressed in\nmm\/month r2 is similar (0.30) over 10\u0001N\u201310\u0001S but is\ngreatly reduced (0.13) over 20\u0001N\u201320\u0001S. This shows that,\nfor land points, it is important to express precipitation\nanomalies as percentage changes away from the deepest\ntropics. For the 45\u0001N\u201345\u0001S and global regions there is no\nclear correlation between the precipitation anomalies and\nd18Op anomalies over land points (r\n2 < 0.05) regardless of\nhow the precipitation anomalies are obtained.\n[40] The standard spatial \u2018\u2018amount effect\u2019\u2019 has often\nbeen calculated only with respect to the tropical oceans\n[e.g., Mathieu et al., 2002]; it is here suggested that the\namount effect over land points is consistent with the amount\neffect over ocean points if climate anomalies (e.g., El Nin\u02dco,\nlong-termmean) are used.We note however that for the region\n20\u0001N\u201320\u0001S, r2 over the land surface (\u00050.3) is much less than\nthat over the full region (\u00050.65). This difference may not\nnecessarily mean that the regressions are less appropriate over\nthe land but rather that the El Nin\u02dco signal is much stronger\nover the ocean and so the signal to noise ratio (both in\nprecipitation and d18Op) is stronger over the ocean.\n6. Discussion and Conclusions\n[41] The addition of stable water isotopes to both the\natmospheric and oceanic components of HadCM3 has been\ndescribed. Modeled d18O for the modern climate compares\nwell with data from a number of sources (such as GNIP,\ncorals and ice cores) and on different time scales (annually,\nseasonally and interannually). While there are some\ndiscrepancies between the model and data many of these\ndiscrepancies can be related to either changes in scale\nbetween the model grid box and the data site, or the model\nbeing unable to fully resolve orography. Other discrepancies\nmay represent more general problems with the modeled\nclimate; for example the model does not accurately simulate\nthe precipitation anomaly associated with El Nin\u02dco over the\nWestern Pacific and hence cannot be expected to accurately\nsimulate the corresponding d18Op anomaly. The largest\ndiscrepancy between model and data occurs over the tropical\ncontinents in annual mean d18Op and requires further\ninvestigation, although this discrepancy is not confined to\nthe HadCM3 model [Lee et al., 2007].\n[42] Our investigation of the isotopic anomaly associated\nwith the present-day ENSO shows that the d18Op anomaly is\ncorrelated with the precipitation anomaly. The d18Osw\nanomaly is also related to the precipitation anomaly but is\nstrongest in coastal regions because of the influence of\nrunoff. Estimating the coral d18O anomaly as a combination\nof d18Osw and sea surface temperature shows the former is\nmore important in coastal regions where there is a large\nd18Osw signal. One region of model error, namely increased\nprecipitation over the Western Pacific in El Nin\u02dco years,\nFigure 7. Relationship between precipitation anomalies and d18Op anomalies for different latitude\nbands of the globe. (EN, El Nin\u02dco composite; LTM, long-term mean climate; and LN, La Nin\u02dca composite.)\nD04111 TINDALL ET AL.: ISOTOPES IN HADCM3\n10 of 12\nD04111\npropagates through to the isotopic model results and leads\nto errors in the modeled d18Osw and estimated coral d\n18O in\nthis region. In regions where the modeled precipitation\nand sea surface temperatures are reasonable there is good\nagreement between estimated and observed coral d18O\nchanges associated with El Nin\u02dco.\n[43] The spatial correlation between d18Op and precipita-\ntion amount is stronger when using the El Nin\u02dco anomalies\ninstead of annual mean precipitation and annual mean\nd18Op. The correlation is improved further when precipita-\ntion anomalies are weighted by precipitation amount and\npresented in units of percentage change. This improvement\nis particularly apparent over land points where the spatial\namount effect was originally considered weak, and in the\nregions 10\u201320\u0001N and 10\u201320\u0001S. It is suggested that the\nimproved correlation between d18Op and precipitation\namount will help with the interpretation of paleodata, and,\nalthough a full analysis of this is beyond the scope of this\npaper, some discussion is desirable.\n[44] The weighted spatial correlation can be used to more\naccurately understand paleoclimatic anomalies (particularly\nthose associated with El Nin\u02dco) and investigate how the\nprecipitation patterns of such anomalies have changed over\ntime. They could also be used to suggest changes in\ncirculation patterns for different periods. Although we note\nthat many observations throughout the tropics would be\nrequired to calculate such spatial correlations which may\nprove a heavy observational requirement. In addition, when\nusing the spatial correlation calculated using precipitation\nanomalies expressed as a percentage change, prior knowl-\nedge about the precipitation distribution over the tropics is\nrequired to reproduce precipitation anomalies (in mm\/month)\nalthough this prior knowledge would not be required if it\nwere sufficient to just know percentage precipitation\nchanges at different locations.\n[45] We have shown that the newly isotope enabled version\nof HadCM3 is a useful tool to investigate both isotopic\nclimate anomalies and the relationship between d18O and\nclimate parameters. Thus it will aid in our understanding of\npast climate systems. The analysis presented here should\nhelp in the interpretation of d18O in the tropical regions.\n[46] Acknowledgments.
