INTRODUCTION\nThe wireless sensor network concept emerged in the early \n1990\u2019s, popularized by the \u201cSmart Dust\u201d concept in 1992. The \nfirst Smart Dust implementation was a battery-powered \nmultichip module (MCM) featuring a microelectromechanical \nsystem (MEMS) corner cube reflector for optical \ncommunications. A monolithic solar-powered variant emerged \nsoon after based on Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI). More cost-\neffective printed circuit board (PCB) radio-enabled variants \nhave been commercialized by Crossbow Technology, Inc. [1]. \nOne emerging wireless sensor network application is for \nhostile environments, particularly those where extreme \nthermal or radiation environments may exist, such as in space. \nSince 1993, satellite miniaturization efforts have pointed \ntowards chip or wafer scale as the ultimate goal, primarily due \nto the prospect of cost-effective mass-production of satellites. \nDuring the decade to follow, many design approaches were \nproposed, but relied on expensive manufacturing technologies. \nIn 1999, the Surrey Space Centre set a long-term goal of \nbuilding and flying a satellite-on-a-chip.  \nRecently, satellite-on-a-chip has gained appeal in the \ncontext of space sensor networks performing a spectrum of \nmassively distributed missions supporting increasing scientific \nand remote sensing goals. A feasibility study was launched in \n2005, revealing that a monolithic system-on-a-chip (SoC) \nimplementation is possible, but numerous external \ncomponents may be required, such as a sensor, power supply, \npassives, crystal clock, and RF antenna [2]-[3]. \nFigure 1. Conceptual SpaceChip system configuration \nA satellite-on-a-chip design, named \u201cSpaceChip\u201d, has been \nproposed, which is based on a monolithic silicon germanium \n(SiGe) bipolar complementary metal-on-silicon (BiCMOS) \nSoC approach as shown in Fig. 1 [1]. In addition, the cost-\neffectiveness of this approach versus other packaging \nalternatives, including traditional PCBs \u201cPCBSat\u201d and MCMs \n\u201cMCMSat\u201d has been assessed [4]. Recently, the Smart Dust \nteam published a feasibility study on an RF-based SoC \napproach [5], where they also concluded that monolithic SoC \nintegration is the ultimate goal for sensor nodes, but many \nlarge off-chip components are still required. \nThis paper discusses three of the underpinning \ntechnologies, which are required to achieve a true monolithic \nSoC implementation of a sensor node for hostile environments \nas follows. Section II presents the development and results to \ndate of integrated solar cells. Section III briefly summarizes \nthe tradeoffs and implementation of a radiation hardened by \ndesign (RHBD) library. Section IV debates the merits of an \nasynchronous microprocessor implementation in the context \nof power efficiency, performance, and area. \nII. INTEGRATED CMOS SOLAR CELLS\nPower distribution, regulation, and control aspects of an \non-chip power system can be met with basic wiring, \nswitching, and regulation circuitry in CMOS. The challenge \nlies in monolithic power generation and storage via solar, \nchemical, nuclear, mechanical, or electromagnetic sources. \nRecent \u201cmicro power\u201d research in energy harvesting gives \nseveral new options for SoC applications [1]. The focus of this \nwork is on integrated solar cells. \nThis effort is sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Air \nForce Material Command, USAF, under grant number FA8655-06-1-3053. \nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect \nthe official policy or position of the United States Air Force, Department of \nDefense, or the U.S. Government.

Cleared by AFIT Public Affairs case #200802 \n978-1-4244-1684-4\/08\/$25.00 \u00a92008 IEEE 824\nSolar cells are typically fabricated with dedicated silicon \nor gallium arsenide processes optimized for efficiency, which \nare incompatible with CMOS. In addition, CMOS does not \nprovide insulating features, as in SOI, which facilitate series \nconnections of cells to reach required operating voltage levels. \nConsequently, monolithic CMOS solar cell research is quite \nsparse. Three known examples are a self-powered \nmicroprocessor [6], artificial vision implants [7], and basic \nresearch into self-powered circuits [8]. None of these efforts \nreported their efficiency results, apart of an estimated \nefficiency of 1% [11] for the solar cell design in [6]. \nMonolithic integration of CMOS, MEMS, and 11% efficient \nsolar cells, has been demonstrated in SOI [9]. However, SOI is \nnot yet widely available commercially, so MCM integration of \nsolar cells is a typical solution used for miniature systems.  \nA. Integrated CMOS Solar Cell Design \nA different approach to solar cell design in CMOS is \npresented here, which aims to overcome the limitations of \nprevious implementations. The 0.35 Pm SiGe BiCMOS (S35) \nprocess from austriamicrosystems (AMS) is used throughout \nthis work due to its cost effectiveness, lack of light-blocking \nlayers, and support for integrated radio in future work. \nThe initial photocell design explores the use of NPN SiGe \nlarge area transistors, which are thin and close to the surface. \nThe standard NPN SiGe bipolar junction transistor (BJT) \nstructure is modified to maximize the collector-base (CB) \nregion and minimize the base (B) contact area, which is left \nfloating. The advantage of this approach is that the photocell \nbias is positive with respect to the substrate, which is essential. \nHowever, test chip results reveal that the NPN CB junction is \nnot activated, and that the underlying n-p junction creates the \ndominant photocurrent, with a negative bias with respect to \nthe substrate. \nThe photocell is redesigned to improve efficiency by \nremoving the ineffective NPN SiGe transistor layers. This \nsimply leaves a large p-n junction, created by the standard n-\nwell implant into the intrinsically p-type substrate. Fig. 2 (left) \nshows the basic layout of a single cell. Fig. 2 (right) is a cross-\nsectional view along A illustrating the active area (black \nsquare) and surrounding polysilicon and metal layers. The key \nto maximum efficiency is the careful placement of these layers \nso that the foundry does not fill over the active region, as this \nprocess has no metal or poly blocking layers available. \np-substrate\nn-well\npoly1\nmet1\nmet2\nmet3\nmet4\npoly1\nmet1\nmet2\nmet3\nmet4\nFigure 2. Single solar cell layout (left) and cross-section along A (right) \nUnlike SOI, there are no insulating layers in typical CMOS \nprocesses beyond the gate oxide. This creates a problem as the \nsingle-cell open circuit voltage in CMOS is about 0.5 V. To \nachieve the minimum operating voltage, the appropriate \nnumber of cells must be connected in series. \nRecently, a conventional single-chip (without external \npassives) charge pump design has been reported for energy \nharvesting applications using external solar cells [10]. A \nsubthreshold negative charge pump is currently under \ninvestigation and is proposed as a solution for providing useful \npower from integrated solar cells in CMOS. \nB. Integrated CMOS Solar Cell Test Results \nSolar cells from AMS S35 run 1550 test chips are \nsubjected to AM0 solar conditions per ASTM E-490 (1366.1 \nW\/m2). Summary current and power measurements are \npresented in Fig.3. The average efficiency is an encouraging \n2.4%, vs. 1% from previous work [11]. The improved cells \nfrom run 1791 resulted in 3.44% efficiency as shown in Fig. 4, \nwhich is a 40% improvement over the first attempt. \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nV (mV)\nI (\nuA\n)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nP \n(u\nW\n)\nIV-1\nIV-2\nIV-3\nIV-4\nIV-5\nP-1\nP-2\nP-3\nP-4\nP-5\nAverage peak power =  21.5 PW\nSolar array area = 641,520 Pm2\nAM0 conditions (1366.1 W\/m2) = 2.45% efficient\nFigure 3.

Solar cell current vs. voltage, AM0, test chip 1791 \nIII. RADIATION HARDENING BY DESIGN\nExtreme radiation conditions can be experienced in \nnuclear power plants, industrial plants, the upper atmosphere, \nand in space. The total dose of ionizing radiation (TID) causes \ngradual system degradation, resulting in an increase in power \nconsumption and slower operation. In addition, high-energy \nparticles, such as electrons, protons, and heavy ions, can cause \nA\n825\nsingle event effects (SEE), predominantly upset (SEU), \nlatchup (SEL), and now more commonly, transient (SET). \nOne decade-old open-source foundry-independent har-\ndening solution at the IC level is RHBD. The disadvantage is \nthat the approach has area and power penalties. Annular \nnMOS transistors mitigate TID-induced edge-leakage \nmechanisms. Guard rings reduce parasitic TID effects and can \neliminate SEL. The inherent increased drive strength (width) \nof the transistors, due to meeting minimum design rules for the \nannular nMOS then balancing with pMOS, increases the SEU \nthreshold and reduces SET. Additional redundancy techniques \ncan be applied where higher SEE hardness is required. A \ntypical test case in 0.25 Pm CMOS, exceeding most mission \nrequirements, is reported in [12] as follows: \nx TID > 1 MRad (Si) \nx SEL > 110 MeV-cm\u00b2\/mg @ 125 qC (latch-up free) \nx SEU < 1x10-12 errors\/bit-day @ 2.25V \nA. RHBD Library Design \nA digital cell library is designed for the AMS S35 process \n(HITKIT 3.70) in the Cadence DFII framework (2006-2007 \n5.1.41). A list of available core logic and I\/O pads are listed in \nTable I. The layout of an RHBD inverter is shown in Fig. 5. \nThe library is minimum sized based on process design rules. \nTABLE I.

RHBD layout of an inverter shown in Virtuoso \nIn addition to the hardened layouts, the Assura design \nverification rules are modified to enable accurate length and \nwidth calculations of the annular transistor. This also enables \naccurate UltraSim full-chip simulations. Abstract views are \nalso available for the SOC Encounter place and route tool. An \nimproved timing library enables more accurate NC-Verilog \nsimulations. The RTL Compiler (synthesizer) is also used. \nB. RHBD Test Results \nThe \u201cMIPS\u201d microprocessor architecture is used as the \nbaseline design for comparative purposes in this section and in \nsection IV [13]. To keep the test chips small and affordable, a \n16-bit, four-register, fixed-point, memory-less MIPS central \nprocessing unit (CPU) is implemented with the minimum \ninstruction set: load word, store word, branch on equal, add, \nsubtract, logical AND, logical OR, set on less than, and jump. \nTwo traditional synchronous CPU designs are fabricated \non AMS S35 run 1725. The baseline CPU designed with the \nAMS S35 standard cell library has an on-chip core area of \napproximately 400u400 Pm excluding the power rings and I\/O \npads. The RHBD CPU has a core area of 700u700 Pm, exactly \nthree times as large as shown in Fig. 6. The increased area is a \nmitigation strategy, which results in a significant power \npenalty.  \n         \nFigure 6. Comparison of the MIPS CPU core areas \nIV. ASYNCHRONOUS RHDB LOGIC \nThis section presents a novel case-study approach to power \nreduction of RHBD circuits using asynchronous logic design. \nAsynchronous logic design has existed since the 1950\u2019s, \noffering potential power savings and performance \nimprovements with a tradeoff in design complexity and small \narea penalty. In its purest form this circuit design approach \naims to minimize transistor switching. Due to the variety of \ncircuit types and implementation techniques, the design \nprocess can be quite complex [14]. Consequently, the \nsynchronous approach is the industry standard due to its \nrelative simplicity and design automation support. Recent \nadvances in asynchronous design tools and commercially \noffered devices is promising. There are two known previous \nattempts to utilize RHBD with asynchronous logic [15], but \nuntil now, a proper case study has not been presented. \nMost recent asynchronous work using new synthesis tools \nsave power and reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) by \n\u201cde-synchronizing\u201d a clocked circuit, which basically removes \nthe global clock tree and replaces it with internal handshaking \nbetween major functional blocks. This approach cannot \nachieve absolute minimum switching, but has demonstrated \nsolid power and EMI reduction results [16]. \nA. Asynchronous RHBD Design Case-Study \nThe MIPS CPU outlined in section III.B is used in the \ncase-study presented here. The employed asynchronous design \nmethodology is design-specific and serves the purpose of \nillustrating how asynchronous logic can reduce the power \n826\npenalty of the application of RHBD. Fig. 7 shows the block-\ndiagram of the asynchronous MIPS CPU. The steps taken to \nde-synchronize the design are as follows:  \n1. Remove unused inverting outputs of library cells \n2. Improve the MIPS control circuit to minimize latching \n3. Replace the global clock with a set of delay elements to \n\u201cripple latch\u201d the data-path in hazard-free order as shown \nin Fig. 8, taking care not to \u201cdouble switch\u201d \n4. Implement unique clock gating in each register \nFigure 7. MIPS Block Diagram Showing Ripple Latch Sequence \nTest results from three MIPS CPU chip implementations \nare shown in Table II and Fig. 9. The asynchronous RHBD \ntest chip is made on AMS S35 run 1791. All results are for a \n16.67 MHz clock rate. All three test chips passed full \nfunctionality testing. Further testing is underway to measure \nthe average power consumption. \nTABLE II.

CONCLUSION\nA cost-effective monolithic system-on-a-chip approach is \nunder investigation to fabricate large numbers of wireless \nsensor nodes for hostile environments including space. Two \nessential building blocks have been developed and reported \non. An improved integrated solar cell design has demonstrated \nan efficiency of 3.44%, which is triple the performance of \nprevious results. A subthreshold negative charge pump is \nunder investigation to complete the power supply. \nAsynchronous logic has been applied to a radiation hardened \nby design microprocessor, reducing the power penalty by \n45%. This approach provides environmental tolerance to \nradiation and temperature extremes. \nREFERENCES\n[1] D. J. Barnhart, T. Vladimirova, and M. N.
