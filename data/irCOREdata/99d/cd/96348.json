The social scientific explanation describes anonymous structural forces,\nthe \u201cresource curse\u201d of the \u201crentier-state,\u201d and how these forces have shaped politics\nand markets with their inexorable logic. The other narrative, of the popular history\nvariety, offers romantic, personalized accounts of desert shaykhs, their whims, and the\nsudden riches of their families (complemented, in some less benevolent accounts, by\ntales of monumental corruption).\nIn its analysis of the creation of the Saudi Arabian administration, this article will, to a\nsurprising degree perhaps, side with the shaykhs. This is despite\u2014or rather because of\u2014\nits ambition to be theoretically informed. By stressing the role of elite decisions in state\ncreation in Saudi Arabia, it will bring personality and politics back into the structurally\noverdetermined accounts of the creation of Gulf states and of rentier systems in general.1\nThe article will look specifically at the formative period of state formation between\n1951 and 1962, when the interplay of administrative growth and elite politics and\npatronage and factionalism was the most intense and the institutional setting the most\nfluid. The account has three main aims. First, it aims to explain how early conflicts\nand deals between senior political figures \u201ccongealed\u201d into institutional constellations\nthat have shaped the kingdom\u2019s political landscape until today. Rapidly growing oil\nincome temporarily gave the Saudi political elite great autonomy in designing the\nshape of their expanding state, and institutions were unusually flexible tokens in power\ngames. Second, the article intends to explain how the Saudi administration developed\na degree of segmentation early on, that is, the tendency of various institutions to be\nlittle \u201cstates within the state,\u201d a feature closely related to the early personalization of\ninstitutional design. This segmentation has allowed the emergence of a few very efficient\nbureaucratic islands but has also led to failures of coordination and the parallel building\nof neopatrimonial bureaucratic fiefdoms, a feature still in evidence in today\u2019s kingdom.\nIncreasing bureaucratization and regularization has often only solidified these cleavages.\nThird, the article explains how the extreme social mobility offered by a rapidly expanding\nstate and its social networks created new players within the economic and political elite.\nSteffen Hertog is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Princeton Environmental Institute, Princeton, N.J.\n08544, and Lecturer in Middle East Politics at the Institute for Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at the\nUniversity of Durham, Durham DH1 3TU, United Kingdom; e-mail: shertog@gmx.de.\n\u00a9 2007 Cambridge University Press 0020-7438\/07 $15.00\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n540 Steffen Hertog\nThis fluidity is in marked contrast to today\u2019s mature and very static Saudi system in\nwhich most stakes have been \u201cparceled out,\u201d both in business and bureaucracy. Many of\nthe Saudi elite and their institutions were made in a dozen dizzying years in the 1950s\nand 1960s.\nIn theoretical terms, the aim of the article is to nuance several assumptions of the debate\non rentier-states by looking closely at the actual history of bureaucratic evolution in Saudi\nArabia, the literature\u2019s staple rentier example. I intend to show that the autonomy of\nrentier-states is not constant over time, as constraints grow with bureaucratic expansion.\nI also demonstrate that external state income does not necessarily lead to inefficient\ninstitutions but rather opens great leeway for institutional design that can be highly\nefficient in some areas and patrimonial in others.\nThe article is divided into two halves. One describes the early jumble of institutional\ngrowth that went along with increasing oil income and the expansion of Al Saud princes\ninto the state after 1951. The second half recounts how a more permanent distribution\nof power and institutional resources emerged from the fundamental struggle between\nKing Saud and Crown Prince Faisal. A more brief section explains how the dispensation\nthat had emerged by 1962 subsequently grew and was consolidated, with the Saudi state\napparatus moving from great fluidity to bureaucratization and eventually great stasis,\nimmortalizing the institutional outcomes of earlier struggles.\nMy account is almost exclusively based on primary sources, significant parts of which\nhave been previously unexploited. I have used archives from three continents, including\nU.S. and British diplomatic documents up to 1975, the extensive records of a 1960s\nand 1970s Ford Foundation mission on administrative reform held at the Institute of\nPublic Administration in Riyadh, the Mulligan Papers at Georgetown University, and\nthe Philby archive at St. Antony\u2019s College, in Oxford. Moreover, I conducted interviews\nwith seasoned diplomats, expatriate advisers, and former Saudi bureaucrats in London\nand Riyadh. Finally, I draw on a large number of dissertations written by Saudis in\nthe West about Saudi administrative development issues and a number of contemporary\ncountry studies and reports in 1950s and 1960s trade journals.\nT H E L IT E R AT U R E\nAlthough much has been written on the impact of the United States on the formation\nof modern Saudi Arabia,2 little research has been done on the internal politics of the\nformation of the modern Saudi state. Sarah Yizraeli\u2019s valuable The Remaking of Saudi\nArabia3 remains the only account concerned primarily with Saudi elite politics in the\n1950s and early 1960s, which I complement from a more institutional perspective:\nYizraeli concentrates mainly on the struggle between Faisal, Saud, and their princely\nfollowers and is less concerned with the formation and composition of bureaucracy as\nsuch. The fiefdom character and segmentation of administration and its interplay with\npersonal politics on various levels therefore are not in the focus of her analysis, which\nresults in a certain overemphasis on the \u201cmodern\u201d aspects of institutional growth and\ndifferentiation under Faisal.\nWhereas Yizraeli focuses mainly on persons, the other main account of modern state\nformation in Saudi Arabia, Kiren Aziz Chaudhry\u2019s The Price of Wealth, conversely talks\nalmost exclusively about structural economic forces and institutions. Individual actors\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 541\nare largely absent from her account, which means that many specifics of institution\nbuilding I focus on go unexplained, and rationality and capacity of the early Saudi\nadministration are considerably exaggerated.4 My claim is that focusing on the interplay\nof personal politics and institutional formation offers the most adequate perspective on\nthe formative years of the modern Saudi state.\nIn addition to contributing to the still thin historiography of Saudi state building, my\nambition is to challenge and contextualize several of the broader theoretical claims of\nrentier-state theories, for which Saudi Arabia has often been used as an archetypical case.\nThere is no fully formulated, generally accepted rentier-state theory. There are, however,\na number of recurring hypotheses connected to effects of oil income on politics.\nFirst, rentier theorists usually argue that oil income grants state elites increased au-\ntonomy from social forces.5 Chaudhry was right to challenge this generalization in her\naccount of the 1980s economic crisis,6 in which entrenched distributional coalitions\nmanaged to stall the regime\u2019s austerity policies. I argue, however, that regime autonomy\nwas considerably higher at an early state of state building, before distributional networks\nand entitlements were established on a large scale. In other words, state autonomy of\nrentier-states seems to decline over time. This highlights the importance of early insti-\ntutional decisions, which can create strong path dependencies that are not accounted for\nin \u201cstatic\u201d rentier theories.\nSecond, my ambition is to disaggregate the state, which is usually dealt with in\nthe aggregate by rentier theorists7 (and, implicitly, by Chaudhry, as she sees all state\ninstitutions subject to the same, although shifting, development dynamics over time).\nBy breaking up the state on a mesolevel, I show that different parts of it have followed\ndifferent trajectories, some developmental, some regressive, largely depending on how\nearly elite decisions shaped institutions. There is no automatic mechanism producing\nregulatory failure and rent seeking in rentier-states.8\nMy account offers a way to look at the crucial role of oil in state building without\nsuccumbing to rentier-state determinism. As Jill Crystal has shown in the cases of\nKuwait and Qatar, crucial junctures of regime formation shape later political options.9\nWhat she does for state-business relations I do for politics within the state. Michael Herb\nhas drawn our attention to the dynamics of \u201cdynastic rule\u201d to explain elite politics and\nregime survival in the Gulf.10 I analyze the impact of dynastic rule on state formation.\nT H E S TAT E O F T H E S TAT E IN T H E E A R LY T O M ID -1 9 5 0 S\nVerily, my children and my possessions are my enemies.\n(Ibn Sa\u2013ud briefly before his death)11\nPatrimonial Rule under \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\nModern bureaucracy is a recent phenomenon in Saudi Arabia. Its first elements were\ncreated in the early 1950s, during King \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s last years, when oil income\nwas taking off. In the lean years before, the kingdom had not been ruled through a\ndifferentiated administrative apparatus but rather through trusted regional governors\ninstalled by the king and supported by other local intermediaries and clients, be they\nnotables or tribal shaykhs.\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n542 Steffen Hertog\nOn the national level, the system completely revolved around \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz, who was\nking and chief legislator and had the right to review all judicial decisions.12 Most of\nthe departments of \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s court were occupied with the logistics of the court\nitself and not broader administration or public services.13 From the western province,\ntaken from the Hashemites in the mid-1920s, \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz had inherited a somewhat\nmore elaborate bureaucratic structure, with special offices for health and education for\nexample.14\nAltogether, however, most Saudis had no contact with formal administration, as apart\nfrom basic security the state provided hardly any services to its citizens. There were\nfew formal, national bodies during most of \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s reign. The Ministry of\nForeign Affairs had been set up in 1930, under Faisal. Ministries of finance and defense\nfollowed in 1937 and 1944. These agencies were not linked through formal mechanisms\nof budgeting or governance.15\nAfter World War II annual oil income started to increase rapidly\u2014from $10.4 million\nin 1946 to $56.7 million in 1950.16 While elderly \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s personal rule grew\nincreasingly slack due to his frailty,17 there was a growing need to manage the huge\nsums of money flowing into the kingdom, as at least his second-oldest surviving son,\nFaisal, and the American diplomats and oilmen present at the time realized.18 In the\nabsence of any scheme for budgeting and development, much of the oil income was\nfrittered away by the court, its clients, and their entourages.19 There was also another\nreason for institution building: with the unquestioned patriarch leaving the stage, a new\ngeneration of princes vied for power and prestige,20 giving them a stake in the creation\nof new posts and ministries.\nAnalysis: A State Created above Society\nThe state would soon start to expand rapidly, providing posts for numerous princely\u261e I\u2019m just\ndiversifiying some\nof these \u201cgrow\u201ds. aspirants. I will argue that the way the state grew was an outcome largely of royal\nelite decisions unconstrained by larger political forces. To substantiate that, some social\nhistory is needed before I engage with princely dealings in detail.\nIn the 1950s the national income was still extremely small by standards of modern\nstatehood. However, the aggregate societal demands on it were even smaller21: Saudi\nsociety, based on an economy that in most regions barely provided for subsistence needs,\nwas unprepared for the riches. Most politics werelocal; people were ruled through the Al\u261e Even though this\ncould be \u201cwas,\u201d it\nsounded odd when\npaired with\n\u201cmost.\u201d\nSa\u2013ud\u2019s tribal or notable intermediaries. The kingdom knew no public space to negotiate\nover national budgets, which were fed externally and grew rather suddenly. Saudi Arabia\nhad no national constitution, no formal mechanisms of political participation, and no\nexperience of national politics. Society was deeply geographically fragmented.\nThere were no large and coherent social groups to voice demands toward the gov-\nernment. Merchants were quickly tied up in patronage structures.22 Their chambers\nof commerce were state created and state dependent and had little voice in policy\nmaking.23 Aramco researchers describe Saudi businessman as \u201cmore individualistic\u201d\nthan their counterparts in other places, not interested in collective bargaining,24 which is\nindeed completely absent from the historical record. Similarly, the independent power\nof tribes had been crushed in the course of \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s conquest of the peninsula in\nthe 1920s and 1930s,25 and they were subsequently co-opted through royal subsidies,\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 543\nwithout much modern state infrastructure interfering or being demanded.26 The kingdom\nhad no working class, with the exception of Aramco workers in the eastern province,\nwhose demonstrations were harshly repressed in the 1950s and 1960s.27 Newspapers\nwere all closely supervised by the state, their boards usually controlled by princes or\nsenior public servants.28\nRobert Vitalis cites a U.S. labor attache\u00b4\u2019s early 1950s conclusion that Aramco \u201ccan\nignore public opinion, which is neither a force nor a voice.\u201d29 American \u201cNew Dealers\u201d\non a technical cooperation mission looked in vain for grassroots initiatives to support\nin Saudi society. Municipal elections in the early 1960s were purely local phenomena\nin which governors could control who would get elected and who would not,30 and in\nwhich the population at large tended to take limited interest.31 Throughout the 1950s and\n1960s there were no parties or other national interest organizations of which to speak.\nThe consultative council still extant in the western province had no real political role\nand no popular backing.32\nThe Saudi \u2013ulama\u00bb, finally, were an important part of the ruling elite but, despite\npopular myths, consistently deferred to royal prerogative, as was indeed their ideology.33\nAs far as they played a role in policy, this concerned matters of public morals, not the\nspecifics of bureaucracy building.34 With no national political traditions and most Saudis\nnot in touch with the administration, society hardly constrained the decisions that royal\nelites made in building their state. A unique pattern of bureaucracy building ensued\nin which yet-embryonic institutions became tokens of intra-elite bargaining among\nambitious princes and a limited number of commoner clients. There was, of course, an\nunderlying concern to build institutions that could administer the increasing flow of oil\nincome;35 but beyond this very general need, personal ambitions and bargains loomed\nvery large in determining specific outcomes.\nIn 1951 \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz created the basis for a rudimentary functional differentiation\nof domestic bureaucratic institutions, separating the Ministry of Interior from the fiscal\nand administrative affairs of the Ministry of Finance. Differentiation meant spread of\nthe royal family into state posts: the Ministry of Interior was given to Faisal\u2019s son,\n\u2013Abdallah.36 In December 1953, briefly after \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s death, ministries of edu-\ncation and agriculture were officially established as spin-offs from interior and finance\nrespectively. Aspiring Prince Sultan took charge of agriculture, his full brother, Fahd, of \u261e Commas depend\non whether there\nare other full\nbrothers. No?\neducation.\nThere were few functioning mechanisms to coordinate their work. The formal intro-\nduction of the Council of Ministers, in 1953, briefly before \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s death, had\nchanged little about actual practices of governance. The new King Saud, \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s\noldest surviving son, governed according to the patrimonial style of his father, basing\nhis rule on the court and embarking on grand tours through the country during which\nhe disbursed royal largesse.37 Decision making on major national questions remained\nlargely informal,38 and although service provision improved in some sectors, governance\nwas marred by \u201cprincely jealousies.\u201d39\nInstitutional Design: \u201cForm Follows Family\u201d\nIt was largely intrafamily patrimonial politics that determined who would receive\nwhich government post\u2014this was no different from other clan-based, administratively\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n544 Steffen Hertog\nunderdeveloped political systems. However, patrimonial politics also determined much\nof the very institutional design of the rapidly growing state during \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s last\nyears and under his first successor.\nInstitutions in the 1950s were malleable and often adjusted to the authority and\nstatus of the individuals or factions leading them. They were occasionally created from\nscratch to either bolster or weaken specific players. Although there was a general trend\nof functional differentiation, concerns of power balancing were as important in the\nemergence of specific bureaucratic designs: princes had to be accorded roles according\nto their seniority while also satisfying their ambitions as much as possible. In the\nsummer of 1951, \u2013Abdallah bin Faisal was made minister of health and interior for the\nreported reason that he should be equal in status to Minister of Defense Prince Mish\u2013al.40\nConversely, the likely motivation for a 1952 plan to set up the Ministry of Air Force, with\nMish\u2013al as minister and his full brother Mit\u2013ib as deputy, was to prevent aviation issues\nfrom falling under the authority of the new Ministry of Communications under Prince\nTalal.41 At some point in 1953, it seemed that Saudi Arabia would have to separate\ngovernment airlines, as Mish\u2013al and Talal could not agree.42\nWhen Talal resigned as minister of communications in 1955, the communications\nportfolio was reassigned to the Ministry of Finance (then under the commoner Moham-\nmad Suroor). Talal told U.S. diplomats that this was essentially a solution to avoid picking\none of the various princely candidates for the post and offending the others.43 There was\nno indication that qualification played a great role in creating and apportioning posts:\nmore talented princes operated next to worse ones.44 As far as we know, no prince was\never fired for performance failure in the 1950s or 1960s. Although the historical record\ndoes not allow us to establish the precise motivations for every specific institutional\ndecision, we can conclude that balances of power and personal ambitions within the Al\nSa\u2013ud have played a uniquely prominent role.\nIt seems that tailoring institutions around personal needs and conflicts was also repro-\nduced on a smaller scale by senior commoner administrators. The then deputy minister\nof finance, Mohammad Suroor, for example, was given a new post supervising both\npilgrimage and broadcasting for the reason that the heads of these two departments were\nrivals, and making Suroor titular head of both meant that neither would be subordinate\nto the other.45 When Saudi ambassador to the United States Asad Al-Faqih returned to\nthe kingdom in 1955, a new senior post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was created\naccording to his own proposal.46 Although skills often did matter when selecting com-\nmoner administrators (such as oil minister Abdallah Tariki or minister of state Abdallah\nbin \u2013Adwan), structures of clientelism and long-term loyalty also played a prominent\nrole, often to the detriment of performance.47\nUnder King Saud, senior appointments and institutional changes were increasingly\na function of his rivalry with Crown Prince Faisal. Apart from Talal, all new princely\nappointments to his \u201creform\u201d cabinet had no administrative experience,48 clearly indi-\ncating that building a coalition in the family was his main concern. The Sa\u2013ud\u2013Faisal\nstruggle has been recounted in detail elsewhere.49 A few examples of how it affected the\ninstitutional setup of the kingdom will suffice. The defense establishment was a prime\nbattleground in terms of successive appointments but also administrative engineering.\nKing Saud detached the Royal Guard under Mus\u2013ad bin Sa\u2013ud from the Ministry of\nDefense to weaken Mish\u2013al and strengthen his own sons. The guard was temporarily the\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 545\nmost powerful military unit.50 In May 1955 Sa\u2013ud decreed the formation of a modern\nnational guard, which was to be headed by another of his sons, Khalid bin Sa\u2013ud. This\nagain was seen as a step against Mish\u2013al, who had been able to prey on national guard\nresources before, as it had been a relatively weak institution headed by a commoner.51 In\n1964, after Sa\u2013ud\u2019s final defeat by Faisal, the Royal Guard was attached to the Ministry\nof Defense, implying its disbandment as independent institution. Institutional design\nfollowed power politics, sometimes resulting in the parallel existence of very similar\nstructures.52\nInstitutions as Fiefdoms\nInstitutions being tokens in political games, they were also used for building personal\nfortunes and expanding one\u2019s following. Proprietary patterns were established early on:\nin his later years, \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz \u201cgranted\u201d several of the new agencies to specific factions\namong his sons, a process in which maternal lines played an important role. Examples\ninclude the Royal Guard, the governorships of Riyadh and Mecca, and the Ministry\nof Defense, all controlled successively by full brothers. Control of specific institutions\nthrough factions within the Al Sa\u2013ud has been a prevalent pattern ever since. Similarly,\nwell-positioned commoner families developed a permanent claim over certain offices.53\nMost senior figures used the institutions they controlled to personally distribute favors\nand conclude business deals. King Sa\u2013ud built up a following of contractors whom he\ndelighted with large contracts for palaces and grossly oversized ministries.54 Minister\nof Defense Mish\u2013al\u2014known as one of the richest princes in subsequent decades55\u2014was\nsaid to have used his privileged post to keep millions of freshly minted riyals for himself,\nas did a number of regional governors.56 Most princes in bureaucratic positions quickly\nsurrounded themselves with growing numbers of hangers-on, advisers, and business\npartners.57\nDifferent princes had different followings: Sa\u2013ud tended to cling to his father\u2019s foreign\nadvisers58 whereas Faisal had a larger number of Hijazi among his clients.59 Fahd later\non would bring more young, educated Najdis into the state apparatus.60 Senior clients\nall had an urban background in common; they were often from client-notable families\nand sometimes upstarts of indistinct background who had worked their way up as loyal\nservants. Tribes were hardly represented in the new elite.61 More important in our context\nis that the elite was very small in size and was built in a top-down fashion by princes,\nwith hierarchies between princes and commoners very strict.62 Clienteles were local\nand did not represent broader social groups, as most of society remained outside of the\nstate\u2019s reach.\nFormal and Informal Authority in a Fluctuating Bureaucracy\nSaudi Arabia largely lacked an administrative tradition and societal checks on bureau-\ncracy. Combined with family politics, this meant that the unprecedented growth of\nbureaucracy in the 1950s was not accompanied by much rationalization. Although some\nnew agencies helped to increase the provision of public services,63 the sudden availability\nof resources also led to uncontrolled, Byzantine expansion based on patronage.\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n546 Steffen Hertog\nMany young administrators were highly inexperienced, especially the royal ones,\nwho had without exception been educated only in the royal court.64 A U.S. dispatch\ndescribed Minister of Defense Mish\u2013al as dignified and serious about his job, but in\nterms of institution building, \u201cthrough lack of education, knowledge and experience,\nperformance results have been practically nil as the Ministry remains unorganized and\nits procedures are on an entirely personal basis. He [Mish\u2013al] leans heavily for advice\nand recommendations on foreign counsel.\u201d65 Similarly, by the time Talal\u2019s Ministry of\nCommunications was reattached to the Ministry of Finance, he was said to have achieved\nvery little.66\nThe personalized nature of institutions went along with a lack of meaningful formal\nprocedures. In the 1950s there were no proper systems of civil-service training, seniority,\nor even document filing.67 The U.S. embassy at the time was trying to keep track of ad-\nministrative development and drew charts of agencies, but \u201c . . . the diagrams themselves\nhave proved to be most confused, since this Government does not lend itself at all well\nto such schematic presentation . . . [T]he organization is so confused, particularly among\u261e OK? YES\nthe lower echelons, that an unwarranted level of research would be required in order to\nfill out charts at all these levels. . . . [S]ince organization means little to this Government,\nit is very flexible and changes with such rapidity that charts are outmoded almost before\nthey can be prepared.\u201d68\nAramco at the time kept a roster of Saudi public personnel, on which the government\nitself depended due to lack of oversight over its fluctuating institutions.69 Several agen-\ncies, such as the Ministry of Economy, created in July 1953, remained merely on paper,70\nas did senior ministerial positions.71 When posts were actually filled, they frequently\nwere just depositories for clients of ministers or princes, adding \u201cexcess baggage\u201d to the\nbureaucracy.72\nInformal authority determined the actual importance of institutions. The bits of bu-\nreaucracy that mattered were run by important princes or by commoners very close to the\ncourt. A formally important institution like the Ministry of Commerce, although headed\nby leading Hijazi merchant Mohammad Alireza, proved to be largely powerless.73\nUndercut by successive ministers of finance with better royal access, and with no\ncommercial regulations emerging from the Council of Ministers, he complained about\nde facto having no role.74 Conversely, a previously inconsequential post such as that\nof comptroller general suddenly became important when it was filled by senior prince\nMus\u2013ad bin \u2013Abdalrahman.75\nAs far as institutions mattered, their day-to-day operations were often carried out\nrather autonomously, with ministries run as fiefdoms.76 The administrative sprawl and\npersonalized nature of authority meant that coordination between agencies was largely\nlacking, with different institutions often producing directly contradictory decisions and\njurisdictions remaining unclear.77 As early as 1952, six different entities were supposed\nto be in charge of economic planning.78\nState\u2013Society Relations: Mobility and Local Clientelism\nAlthough the formal state was still small, unorganized, and self-absorbed, its combina-\ntion of growing resources and institutional fluidity meant that it offered great chances\nfor a small number of people in the right place at the right time. Access to the expanding\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 547\ncourt, with its growing needs for material supplies from the 1940s on, offered great\nopportunities for social and economic mobility and influence peddling. Many of the\nprominent Saudi merchant families established their privileged positions as suppliers\nto King \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz, with some of them being granted exclusive trade agencies by\nthe king, which they still hold today. Players from the Jomaih, Rajhi, or Juffali families\nmade their first appearances, often emerging from rather humble Najdi backgrounds\n(Jomaih, for example, was the king\u2019s grocer from the village of Shaqra; Rajhi was a\nmoney changer in the Riyadh suq).79 Several of the king\u2019s advisers and their offspring\nalso used their positions to venture into business, including the Pharaon and Khashoggi\nfamilies.\nIn a related pattern, auxiliary positions at court could be the starting point of public-\nservice careers. \u2013Abdallah bin \u2013Adwan, for example, worked his way up to head of\nthe important ministry of finance branch in the (oil-rich) eastern province, without\nany formal education, thanks to the intervention of then crown prince Sa\u2013ud, whose\nbodyguard he had been.80 Id bin Salem moved from being a mechanic to head of the\nroyal garage and one of Sa\u2013ud\u2019s leading advisors.81 Interpreters \u2013Abdallah Tariqi and\nMohamad Ibrahim Mas\u2013ud (the latter with the U.S. embassy) became the minister of oil\nand minister of state, respectively.82\n\u2013Abdallah Sulaiman\u2019s Empire: Mobility of Commoners\nIt is the Najdi Sulaiman Al-Hamdan family that probably has combined both patterns\u2014\nmerchant and bureaucratic mobility\u2014most masterfully. Their story colorfully illustrates\nthe contingent, personalized, and fiefdom-like trajectory of early institution building, as\nwell as the great associated opportunities of clientelism.\n\u2013Abdallah Sulaiman was a Najdi of humble background who worked his way up from\nclerk to the first Saudi minister of finance and close confidant of \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz. Until the\nearly 1950s, Sulaiman\u2019s ministry combined an inordinate range of administrative duties,\nits subordinate departments including health, public works, education, and agriculture.\nTheir workings usually were opaque and left great scope for patronage. At the Ministry\nof Finance affiliated customs, Ottoman-inspired clearing procedures involved up to\nthirty different signatures, and kickbacks were common. A British diplomat commented\nsardonically, \u201cThe Director of Posts proudly proclaims that he had British training.\nThere are naturally Saudi improvements on this; the postage stamp clerk, for instance,\nwill take the money for letters and stick the stamps on later; after eighteen months in\nthe job he can build himself a large house.\u201d83 The ministry was well known for its\n\u201cwidespread system of letting contracts on a basis of personal favoritism rather than\nexpected performance and cost,\u201d84 the beneficiaries usually being Sulaiman\u2019s merchant\nfriends.85\nSulaiman, based in Jeddah, was given large administrative discretion by the king.86\nHis brother Hamad and his son \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz were vice and deputy minister respectively,\nthe higher rank for his brother being created specifically for him (it still exists today).87\nApart from profiteering activities, Hamad was reported to be largely inactive.88\nSulaiman had started to procure government supplies through figureheads in the\n1920s, and his merchant friends lent him money without interest, which in turn was\nused to purchase goods at inflated prices for the court.89 He was given the lucrative\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n548 Steffen Hertog\ncement franchise for the Hijaz in the late 1940s.90 Sulaiman owned palaces and large\ntracts of land and had his own entourage of some 400 people. After retiring in 1954,\nhe ran hotels and a number of trading companies. His descendants are still among the\nprominent merchants of Jeddah.91\nSeveral big businessmen were \u201cmade\u201d or at least boosted by the Ministry of Finance\nduring Sulaiman\u2019s time, including some who served under him.92 The case of Hasan\nSharbatli is perhaps the most colorful example of how upstart clients could rapidly gain\nstatus and wealth. The diplomatic note on him bears a lengthy citation:\nClimaxing a rags-to-riches career illustrative of the fluidity of Hejazi mercantile society, Hasan\nSharbatli, Jidda merchant and public benefactor, recently received from the King the title of\nHonorary Minister of State . . . [making him the ninth of this kind. The title] implies no necessary\u261e Block quote\nimplies verbatim.\nIs this interior\nquote in original?\nNO IT\u2019S MY\nOWN\nINSERTION. OK\nIN []\nBRACKETS?\nassumption of government powers . . . Sharbatli, who only ten years ago was a fruit-vendor and\nsmall-time auctioneer in Jidda, reportedly gained entry into the favored circles of the Ministry of\nFinance by sending to Hamad al SULEIMAN, brother of the minister, a gift of fruit. So pleased\nwas the recipient that he recommended the appointment of Sharbatli as Government Purchasing\nAgent.\nIn this capacity, Sharbatli evolved an eminently satisfactory relationship with the government.\nSelling a hypothetical 5,000 riyals worth of fruit, he would then bill the Ministry for 50,000 riyals\nand subsequently share the profits with his sponsors in the Ministry.93\nSharbatli accumulated a total reported credit of 43 million riyals with the government.\nUnable to redeem the debt for himself, Sharbatli became one of the kingdom\u2019s largest\ncharitable benefactors. He became one of the richest men in the kingdom, had a virtual\nmonopoly on pilgrim travel, and had reportedly given 500,000 riyals for the establish-\nment of the Saudi air force.94 He also set up his own bank.95 Sharbatli\u2019s case illustrates\nthat although the royal family was clearly at the center of the polity and of state growth,\nmore or less, random networks of commoners within and around the administration had\ngreat distributional leeway and offered great mobility at an early stage\u2014and the chance\nto position oneself for later decades.\nThe story of Sulaiman, however, also demonstrates how commoners\u2019 local power, in\nthe final analysis, depends on royal patronage. The minister was a favorite of King \u2013Abd\nal-\u2013Aziz but not of his sons Sa\u2013ud and Faisal. Sulaiman and his family left the ministry\none year after \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s death. Even the most senior and trusted commoner with\na large personal clientele did not have any independent support he could count on once\nhe had fallen out of favor.\nExternal Advisers and Islands of Efficiency: The Saudi Arabian\nMonetary Agency\nBefore that, however, Sulaiman had surprisingly gotten involved in probably the most\nsignificant attempt at administrative rationalization in the 1950s: the creation of the\nSaudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). In the early 1950s monetary chaos reigned\nin Saudi Arabia.96 Interested in at least minimal economic stability, the U.S. embassy\nand Aramco successfully lobbied the king to accept U.S. consultants into the kingdom.\nU.S. adviser Arthur Young managed to convince Sulaiman and the king of the need\nfor basic monetary and banking regulation. Young was mandated by the king to draw\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 549\nup a charter for what was to become SAMA within a few hours.97 SAMA derived its\nincome by charging the government for its services. Its first head was also an American,\nand accountants were hired from Lebanon.98\nKing \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz and Sulaiman had been convinced of the existential need for\ninstitution building in this strategic sector. SAMA\u2019s charter and use of expatriate tech-\nnocrats bolstered the relative independence of the body. After the Ministry of Finance\ntemporarily sidelined SAMA,99 in 1957 the governorship was taken over by another\nexpatriate, Anwar \u2013Ali, who had come to the country with an International Monetary\nFund mission and who held the post as a confidant of King Faisal until his death, in 1974.\nDifferent from other \u201cfiefdom ministries,\u201d SAMA\u2019s well-paid leadership used relative\nautonomy and \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz\u2019s and Faisal\u2019s clear reform mandates to become one of the\nbest central banks in the Middle East.\nThe specific social and political structure of Saudi Arabia gave its political elite\nlarge temporary autonomy, in this specific regard confirming rentier theory. The new\nexternal income left much space for state actors\u2019s individual patronage interests and for\ndistribution and institutional design to be negotiated within the state. Much of the modern\nstate was originally created above society, following its own peculiar logic of fiefdoms\nand their lateral sprawl. In the 1950s Aramco and the U.S. embassy were probably the\nmost significant lobbyists for bureaucratic rationalization in the kingdom, ahead of all\ndomestic groups.100\nT H E E M E R G IN G B U R E A U C R AT IC O R D E R U N D E R FA IS A L\nFaisal\u2019s Order by Cabinet\nU.S. pressure was largely ineffective under Sa\u2013ud, with politics and institutional change\nfollowing elite dynamics as described above. Despite U.S. lobbying, no coherent bud-\ngeting happened,101 and an American Point IV assistance mission was canceled.102 It\nwas under Faisal that some degree of order was brought into the government apparatus,\nas is explained in the following section. Again, this was at least driven as much by royal\nfamily politics as by perceived development needs. Faisal\u2019s struggle with Sa\u2013ud was at\nits apex between 1958 and 1962, and it was in this period that institutions were reshaped\nmost dynamically, with the power interests of the Faisal faction eventually prevailing.\nAfter 1962, a stable balance of elite forces combined with bureaucratic growth and\nregularization led to the \u201clocking in\u201d of personal and institutional constellations at the\ncore of the state.\nSome of the institutional balancing games between Faisal and Sa\u2013ud in the field of\nsecurity organization have already been adumbrated. After 1958, the struggle between\nthe two brothers went deeper than that: the core of what the Saudi state was to be was\nat stake in the conflict, with fundamentally different institutional concepts deployed by\nboth players, reflecting the fluidity of Saudi governance structures at the time.\nThe Saudi drive for political order began with a May 1958 decree that enhanced\nthe status of the Council of Ministers, with Faisal as prime minister. The reason was\nthat a coalition within the Al Sa\u2013ud had pushed for enhancing Faisal\u2019s standing against\nSa\u2013ud, who was, among other things, perceived as favoring his sons over his brothers\nand incapable of handling the state budget, which was in a severe deficit. The decree\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n550 Steffen Hertog\ngave the Council of Ministers the final authority in financial matters. The king could\nreturn decrees to the council, with further steps kept ambiguous.\nAlthough a step toward formal government, the May 1958 institutional redesign most\nof all reflected a temporary personal balance of power between Faisal and Sa\u2013ud, as\nSa\u2013ud was to remain king and Faisal responsible to him. Institutions at the very core of\nthe state were pliable weapons in the struggle. Sa\u2013ud as king with a court had larger quasi-\ntraditional, patrimonial resources at his disposal and used those to increase his following\nthrough royal handouts and tours through the country. Faisal, conversely, promoted more\nmodern institutions of rule to boost his otherwise inferior standing, trying to curtail the\nroyal budget and enforce cabinet rule. There was no superior constitutional (or societal)\nframework to contain the struggle to be fought within given institutions.\nThe brothers\u2019 attitudes toward institutions could be quite instrumental, a point vin-\ndicated by the institutional track record of the two protagonists. In 1959 Sa\u2013ud re-\nportedly planned the creation of a consultative council with 120 members, including\ntribal representatives, \u2013ulama\u00bb, and members of the Al Sa\u2013ud. It would take over some\nresponsibilities of the Council of Ministers and hold legislative power.103 It very much\nlooked like an attempt by Sa\u2013ud, at that time inferior, to regain territory, as the king would\nappoint the majlis. It is striking that supposedly \u201ctraditional\u201d Sa\u2013ud would forward such\na relatively progressive concept. Conversely, Faisal was very reluctant to give up his\ntraditional post as vice regent of the Hijaz, although that hampered homogenization\nof the national administration in Saudi Arabia. He used the post as a bargaining chip\nto attain the premiership.104 If politically expedient, Faisal could hamper bureaucratic\nrationalization.\nConversely, Faisal\u2019s buildup of bureaucracy was completely centered on himself. Until\nSa\u2013ud temporarily regained power, in 1960, Faisal achieved a certain separation of state\nand royal family affairs and a degree of budgetary control and monetary modernization\nwith IMF assistance.105 This he accomplished through stark centralization of authority,\nhowever. In addition to being minister of foreign Affairs and finance, in April 1959 he\nalso took over the interior portfolio. Although this enabled Faisal to exert more control\nover regional fiefdoms of other princes, it created a bottleneck of decision making.106\nRated as a thorough individualist by Aramco researchers, Faisal sat on decisions.107\nLiberal Saudis, although sometimes conceding that Faisal stuck to formal rules more\nclearly than Sa\u2013ud, deplored such overcentralization.108\nThe Council of Ministers was, most of all, an instrument for Faisal to gain power\nthrough the post of prime minister.109 It is true that after Sa\u2013ud\u2019s fall from grace, in\n1962, it somewhat improved policy coordination\u2014not least because the royal diwa\u00afn\nas parallel political actor had disappeared. Faisal was generally willing to devote more\ntime to the formal workings of government,110 seeing a degree of budgetary control\nand more clearly defined administrative units as instruments of stability. Most of his\nreformist ambitions beyond the establishment of basic order petered out soon after Sa\u2013ud\nhad been stripped of all powers in 1964, however. In a period of regional turmoil, Faisal\nwas interested in stability, not rapid development.\nSa\u2013ud, through his alliance with junior princes, seemed temporarily to introduce more\nplayers into decision making. This was an outcome of his alliance strategy, though,\nas was the progressive-developmentalist orientation of the new cabinet: he had relied\nbefore on his father\u2019s small and closed group of decidedly reactionary Syrian advisers.111\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 551\nHis younger royal allies in turn were further down in the seniority ranking. One can\nspeculate that they saw progressive politics as a shortcut to positions of power otherwise\nunavailable to them.\nIn any case, the reformist episode proved short lived, as Faisal\u2019s coalition with Fahd\nand his full brothers first drove out Talal and his brothers, then Sa\u2013ud. It is telling that\nthe group that had built the larger alliance within the royal family carried the day. At\nno point in the struggle were broader social constituencies mobilized.112 Talal and his\nprincely allies might have banked on support by \u201cyoung intellectuals,\u201d having seen the\nrevolutionary examples of Egypt, Iraq, and Syria. In Saudi Arabia, however, this stratum\nremained small, amorphous, and incapable of action. Talal failed to rouse support.113\nWhen progressive adviser \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz Mu\u2013ammar briefly gained agenda-setting\npower under Sa\u2013ud, this did not reflect a social revolution but rather a temporary\npower vacuum between different royal factions. Mu\u2013ammar and his small circle of\nfriends had no organizational base to rely on and were quickly thrown out when Sa\u2013ud\ndecided they were damaging to him. At any rate, Mu\u2013ammar had always known that\nSa\u2013ud had deployed him as part of a \u201cpower play\u201d114 and not because of a suddenly\ndiscovered reformist zeal. Other \u201cprogressive\u201d young Saudis, such as Zaki Yamani and\nHisham Nazer, got the message and had themselves co-opted into senior administrative\npositions as docile technocrats under Faisal. Commoner administrators quickly stopped\nspeechifying about political reform.115\nConsolidation of Fiefdoms: The 1962 Cabinet Deal\nThroughout the 1960s, the Saudi budgets once again continued to expand\u2014quadrupling\nwithin less than a decade116\u2014and the bureaucratic apparatus grew with them, offering\nnew mobility for commoners. Ministries of petroleum, Hajj affairs, labor and social\naffairs, and information were created between 1960 and 1963. After 1963 and until the\noil boom, however, the growth of the budget implied growth of existing institutions rather\nthan creation of new ones. The expansion of a number of fiefdoms would continue, but\nin a much more orderly manner.\nThe cabinet that emerged in October 1962 had become the gravitational center of\nSaudi politics and represented a post-Sa\u2013ud distribution of power that grew increasingly\nimmovable. It was based on a stable balance of forces within the Al Sa\u2013ud and was the\nend result of the Sa\u2013ud\u2013Faisal struggle. Faisal kept the post of prime minister, which he\nwould fuse with the kingship from 1964 on (a structure his successors have inherited).117\nFaisal\u2019s senior allies in the conflict were rewarded with ministerial posts; Fahd and the\nsultan, young and \u201cmodernizing\u201d supporters, were given the portfolios of interior and\ndefense, respectively.\nSticking to established patrimonial patterns, they brought in full brothers to take up\nspecially designated vice ministry posts in subsequent years.118 The sultan has kept his\nministry ever since, but Fahd handed his portfolio over to his younger brother Nayef\nupon becoming crown prince in 1975. Prince \u2013Abdallah, another ally of Faisal, was given\ncabinet status and control of the national guard in 1963, which he has kept until today. In\n1967, the special post of second deputy prime minister was created for Fahd, underlining\nhis ambitions to be next in line after his older half-brother Khaled, a moderate figure\nFaisal made crown prince for reasons of seniority and intrafamily balance119 despite\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n552 Steffen Hertog\nKhaled\u2019s disinterest in politics and lack of a previous government role.120 Institutional\ndecisions again followed the royal power balance.\nAll of the major princes embarked on expanding their institutions, which became\nirreducibly identified with their persons. Growing budgets allowed for ambitious pro-\ngrams, most remarkable among them the sultan\u2019s expansion of the Saudi air force in the\n1960s.121 Staff numbers, business opportunities, and networks of gatekeepers, brokers,\nand business partners expanded concurrently. As the Ministry of Defense was organized\naround the sultan (and to a lesser extent his full-brother deputies), all of its organiza-\ntional units were oriented toward him as central authority. Armed services and the civil\nadministration in the ministry hence cooperated little.122 Similarly, \u2013Abdallah was the\nfigure around whom the national guard was organized. Foreign specialists assessed the\nguard\u2019s chains of command as ill defined and overcentralized. As the guard was also\na government agency, the presence of civilians in its headquarters, accountable only to\n\u2013Abdallah, decreased its administrative coherence.123\nFaisal and the Civil Service: Slow Regularization\nBeyond the \u201csovereignty ministries,\u201d most of the other posts in the 1962 cabinet were\ncontrolled by commoners, as Faisal strove to limit the number of princes in the cabinet\nto make it manageable,124 another pattern that would become \u201clocked in,\u201d as most of\nthe cabinet posts reserved for nonroyals then have been held by commoners until now.\nA stable distribution of power did not automatically mean integrated government. Un-\nder Faisal the Saudi administration still suffered from enduring problems of overcentral-\nization and lack of coordination between agencies.125 As institutions grew in parallel,\nfunctionally similar bureaucratic units reported to different ministries, and duplication\nand conflicts of authority were endemic.126 As all actors were oriented toward Faisal,\nthere was little horizontal communication of commoner bureaucrats, while Faisal\u2019s\nbrothers were busy building their fiefdoms. The phenomenon of \u201cpaper agencies\u201d\npersisted\u2014for example, a Ministry of Justice was decreed in 1962 but not actually set\nup until 1971. All good intentions of development planning got lost somewhere between\nagency conflicts and an insufficient database.127 The Central Planning Organization, set\nup in 1964, had little leverage over other ministries during most of the 1960s,128 and\nseveral ministries never submitted their financial reports to the Ministry of Finance.129\nDifferent from the sprawl of the state in the 1950s, however, was the clear regulariza-\ntion of bureaucratic growth both in terms of stability of the overall setup and of internal\nbureaucratization of institutions. The setup became less fluid. Although facing an acute\nshortage of qualified administrators, Faisal managed to assemble some good commoner\nministers around him, which might explain how at least some decisions were carried\nout.130 \u201cElsewhere,\u201d as one British diplomatic source explains, \u201cas so often in develop-\ning countries, it [was] the bureaucratic bindweed that [took] root and proliferated most\nquickly, its function being to choke decision and action.\u201d The \u201cbureaucratic bindweed,\u201d\nhowever. did go along with institutionalization of the civil service, making for gradual\ninstitutional consolidation.\nFaisal achieved a discernible rationalization of the bureaucracy. As early as June 1958,\na royal decree reforming the civil service was issued. It clarified the classification of\nemployees, salary schedules, and criteria for hiring and terminating employment.131 The\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 553\nuse of public offices for private gain was prohibited and severe penalties threatened. Pri-\nvate business activities of bureaucrats were very common at the time, and the Americans\nrated the decree as a serious attempt by Faisal to decrease malpractice.132\nTo be sure, overcoming the shortage of qualified and committed personnel was an\nuphill struggle in a grossly undereducated society.133 In the early 1960s, the Institute of\nPublic Administration, in Riyadh, was set up with international assistance and imparted\nbasic administrative skills to increasing numbers of Saudis. Having to start almost from\nscratch, its impact was only gradual. At the end of the 1960s, the pool of skilled adminis-\ntrators was still very small and recruitment often based on nepotism.134 Many bureaucrats\nwere involved in business interests tied to their respective agency.135 Absenteeism was\nrampant,136 and attempts by a large Ford Foundation consultancy mission in the 1960s\nto create a merit-based public service did not yield significant results, as the Central\nPersonnel Bureau proved unable to break into the turf of other ministries.137\nFaisal\u2019s own commitment to orderly and rule-bound administration should not be\noverstated. In his context, he was austere,138 but that did not mean that he did not have\nhis own trustees, brokers, and business clients, whom he paid off in various ways.139 The\nAlireza family, close to Faisal since his time as Hijazi vice regent, was amply supplied\nwith defense-related contracts.140 Princes from Faisal\u2019s own family branch were heavily\ninvolved in business.141 Although the clientelist distribution of budgets and deals was\nrelatively well controlled under Faisal, his rule was no exception to the basic pattern.142\nStill, all nepotism and clientelism occurred within a progressively bureaucratized\ninstitutional setting, the main components and cleavages of which did not change fun-\ndamentally after the early 1960s. The 1971 comprehensive civil-service law led to\nfurther consolidation of bureaucratic rules and clearer formal concepts of salary scales,\nseniority, and hierarchy.143 The Institute of Public Administration augmented its profile\nunder the leadership of \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz Quraishi in the late 1960s, and increasing numbers\nof foreign-trained Saudis entered public service.144 The internal structures of agencies,\nthough still fluid in many cases, were much better defined and permanent than ten years\nearlier.145\nT H E B U R E A U C R AT IC IM M O RTA L IZ AT IO N O F F IE F D O M S\nIN T H E 1 9 7 0 S\nThe final and dizzying phase of Saudi state expansion after the 1973 oil boom hap-\npened in a much more orderly way, based on existing institutions, than in the 1950s.146\nParadoxically, bureaucratization and state growth also led to entrenchment of existing\nfiefdoms in the boom\u2014the final phase of state growth. As the budget quadrupled and\ntotal state employees increased from 52,000 in 1960 to 124,000 in 1970,147 royals had\ngrowing powers of patronage in their realms, and entrenchment of civil-service rules\nmade for increased institutional stability on lower levels.148\nThe defense budget, usually above one-quarter of overall state expenditure, allowed\nPrince Sultan to expand his ministerial fiefdom to a full \u201cstate within a state,\u201d attaching\nlarge-scale housing, health, and educational infrastructure to his ministry. The largest\nof Sultan\u2019s artificial \u201cmilitary cities\u201d in the northern periphery of the kingdom was\nsupposed to house 70,000 people.149 Although the Saudi military was gradually formal-\nized, all organizational units of the ministry remained organized around Sultan as the\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n554 Steffen Hertog\ncentral authority, hampering communication among them.150 The national guard under\n\u2013Abdallah developed similar structures on a smaller scale, having its own \u201ccities\u201d and\nparallel housing, education, and health systems.151 The Ministry of Interior under Fahd\nand Nayef, dubbed a \u201crule unto itself\u201d152 by a seasoned British diplomat, also built up\nits own infrastructure.\nAll of the major fiefs conferred enormous patronage power to their heads through the\nsheer scale of employment,153 the provision of select services, and numerous business\ncontracts of various sizes. Considerable parts of society were drawn into the orbit of big\ngovernment agencies as clients in one form or another.154\nThe dynamics of growth often reinforced segmentation. The Ministry of Defense,\nthe national guard, and the Ministry of Interior seem to have seen repeated competition\nover budget allocations, and there was a persistent overlap in security functions.155\nThe autonomous power of senior princes meant that they ignored budgetary rules in\ntheir procurement, undermining coherent economic planning.156 The parallel buildup of\nindependent housing and health services prevented integrated sectoral policies.157 The\nparallel power bases of princes made national decision making and, on a lower level,\nday-to-day policy coordination more difficult.\nSegmentation was reproduced on a smaller scale among agencies headed by trusted\ncommoners. Due to the underdevelopment of general infrastructure and public services,\nagencies under conditions of fiscal abundance strove to create their own services to\nbe able to develop autonomously.158 Institutions functioned in more predictable and\nformal ways than in past decades; the civil service law was refined in 1977 and a\nfurther empowered Civil Service Bureau created.159 However, the persistent hierarchical\norientation of various agencies meant that they rarely coordinated in policy and budgeting\nmatters. In the process of rapid growth they acquired their own vested interests and,\ntypically, their own housing and other infrastructure annexes and in at least one case,\ntheir own TV studio and gas station.160\nHowever, similar to the case of SAMA in the 1950s, further state expansion in the\n1970s and early 1980s allowed for new islands of efficiency to emerge, staffed by\nthe most promising technocrats and given relative autonomy from the rest of the civil\nservice. These include the Saudi Ports Authority, the Saudi Arabian Basic Industries\nCorporation, and the Riyadh Development Authority.161 Although the core structure\nof state and regime remained unaltered, the oil boom still allowed for new institutional\ncreations on a technocratic level, offering great mobility to aspiring administrators, some\nof them successfully co-opted into the system despite their originally leftist leanings.162\nSimilarly, the boom was the last time new big business names were added to those that\nhad emerged in the 1950s, most saliently that of later Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq\nHariri, who became a billionaire construction magnate under the patronage of King\nFahd.\nMobility Closure and Congealment\nThe institutional fluidity of the 1950s and 1960s and the enduring mobility in the 1970s\nand early 1980s stand in sharp contrast to the stasis and mobility closure since the mid-\n1980s. Since the end of the boom, the expansion of the Saudi state has largely stopped\nand with it change and mobility within the system. The institutions created since the\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 555\nearly 1950s have congealed into a permanent setup through bureaucratic formalization\nand resource constraints but also through sheer size and scope of the state.\nSome well-known facts suffice to illustrate how the end of the boom has brought an\nend to the internal dynamic of the Saudi system: not only have all the leading princes\nclung to their posts (until death in the case of Fahd), but also Saudi business has seen\nvery few big newcomers since the oil bust in 1986. The turnover of technocrats in the\ncabinet has decreased markedly, with their average age strongly increasing.\nThere has been little change in the setup of government agencies, which have proven\nto persist once they had grown. The socioeconomic entitlements created through state\ngrowth seem to have fettered the once autonomous system, with the wage bill steadily\nincreasing as a share of public expenditure between the early 1980s and the late 1990s.\nAs more social groups have been tied to the state through the formalized clientage of\nemployment and service provision, the government, it appears, has become increas-\ningly immobile, largely incapable or unwilling to impose cuts on the public payroll\nand subsidized public services.163 The stickiness of bureaucratic employment prevents\ninstitutional reengineering. Policy in the last twenty years has been limited mostly to\n\u201cputting out fires,\u201d with few grand initiatives.164\nC O N C L U S IO N\nFor those who know the modern Saudi bureaucratic behemoth, its unmovable institutions\nand administrative stasis, the great fluidity of early years as traced in this article is hard\nto imagine. The modern Saudi bureaucracy was created in the 1950s and early 1960s by\nan elite that was largely unconstrained by society or established bureaucratic structures.\nThe rapid, personalized creation of government institutions happened in a completely\ntop-down fashion and in a relative political vacuum. Political agency and voluntarism\ndetermined state formation at least as much as the development needs of Saudi society\ndid. The Al Sa\u2013ud laterally expanded into a state apparatus that was most of all geared\nupon their internal distribution of power. The rapid shifts in institutional design reflected\nthe unique autonomy of the early Saudi rentier-state and its role as playing field for intra-\nelite balancing games.\nSaudi bureaucracy building often seems not to be a case of \u201cform follows function\u201d\nbut of \u201cform follows family.\u201d Institutional reforms often were instruments in an intra-\nelite power game as much as attempts to modernize the state. Whereas Yizraeli sees\nprimarily a clash between different ideologies of rule and development between Sa\u2013ud\nand Faisal, the present account adds a rather more instrumental view of institutional\ninitiatives by both players, with institutions as flexible tokens of power. It is not pos-\nsible to glean specific princely motivations from the archival record on every single\ninstitutional decision. We do know, however, that power politics within the family\u2014\nwhatever its details\u2014consistently loomed larger than other considerations when it came\nto negotiating institutional change.\nShifts in State Autonomy\nRentier-state theory posits state autonomy as a result of external state income. As\nfar as autonomy is a useful concept at all, the present historical analysis of Saudi\ninstitutions indicates that it is not constant over time: early state autonomy seems to\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\n556 Steffen Hertog\nhave been uniquely large, and political agency determined structures of rule. In later\nyears, conversely, the weight of established structures has taken away much of the\npolitical and distributional leeway the Saudi elite used to have. The rentier argument\nthat external revenues give state elites free reign\u2014at least in underdeveloped states with\nrelatively cohesive elites\u2014seems to make much more sense in early phases of state\nbuilding and, to a lesser degree, while the expansion lasts. Similar patterns may be at\nwork in other late-developing rentier-states. Frequent shifts in alliance and redesigns of\nthe fledgling Omani state under Qaboos in the early 1970s, for example, have given way\nto more static development in subsequent decades.165\nPath Dependency of Institutional Design\nMany of today\u2019s permanent features of the Saudi state can be traced back to early\ncontingencies and the crucial juncture of 1962. Civil Aviation\u2019s attachment to the Min-\nistry of Defense, the Vice Ministry of Finance, the large size of the national guard,\nthe omnipresent role of the Ministry of Interior\u2014all are outcomes of the politics of\nthe day, which happened to be perpetuated by bureaucratic growth and\/or agreements\nto maintain a given power balance. Similarly, the composition of significant parts of\nthe Saudi private sector is often an outcome of chance encounters that happened many\ndecades ago. The expanding Saudi rentier-state provides powerful examples of \u201cpath\ndependency,\u201d the idea that relatively small, early events can have a strong influence\non subsequent structural developments. The rapid growth of rentier-states can lead to\na \u201ctelescoping\u201d effect, magnifying the effects of early decisions manifold and locking\nthem in as states grow mature and harder to change.\nMore than any other event, the 1962 cabinet deal shaped the face of Saudi politics for\nthe subsequent half century. However, it also appears somewhat contingent in retrospec-\ntive: there were reported offers by Sa\u2013ud to make Fahd his prime minister, which the latter\nrejected.166 Had Fahd accepted, Saudi Arabia and its institutions of governance would\nlook much different today. There were also rumors that Mohammad bin \u2013Abd al-\u2013Aziz,\nan irascible older brother of Fahd, could be made minister of finance, which again would\nhave changed the balance of power\u2014and quite likely, institutions\u2014tremendously.167\nInstead, sober Minister of Finance Prince Mus\u2013ad bin \u2013Abdalrahman controlled the\nfisc and helped to limit the intrusion of royals into the state. Although this policy was\nloosened under Fahd, Faisal\u2019s decision to keep princes largely out of technocratic cabinet\nposts in 1962 established a pattern that has been perpetuated until today and that differs\nfrom other Gulf Cooperation Council states with large ruling families, which tend to\nhave princely ministers of finance, oil, and commerce.168\nPath Dependency of State Segmentation\nRegularization and growth of the bureaucracy helped to reduce the fluidity of admin-\nistrative structures, increasingly limiting change to the lower rungs of the state and\nentrenching senior office holders within an established power balance. It also helped to\ndeepen the fiefdom character of certain institutions that dominate the Saudi scene today.\nIt is ironic that in the first place it had been the lack of clearly defined bureaucratic\nhierarchies that tended to give institutions the character of personal courts and enabled\nxxx 07-107 August 20, 2007 10:1\nShaping the Saudi State 557\nsmall-scale empire building. With formal procedures loosely defined, ministries were\nfrequently used for patronage and to recruit allies\u2014not only by royals but also by well-\npositioned commoners, several of who left their mark on the Saudi state. As the state\ngrew more complex and the Al Sa\u2013ud delegated authority only in specific institutional\ncontexts, the fragmentation of the state did not disappear but was often consolidated\nthrough bureaucratization. Although Faisal\u2019s overcentralization persisted, agencies often\nkept their island character, communicating mostly vertically.\nAgain, many institutional idiosyncrasies of Saudi Arabia would not be thinkable\nwithout rent surpluses that allowed institutional sprawl and costly redundancy. In a\nstarkly contrasting example from an originally quite similar country, John Davis has\nargued that oil rents in Libya allowed for the experiment of abolishing significant parts\nof the state.169 What these two very different oil states seem to demonstrate is that\nrents can allow for unusual, possibly dysfunctional institutional experiments without\npredicting what these will look like.\nApproaching rentier-states from this angle, the focus is once more on contingency and\nagency, which are in turn crucial to understanding the internal heterogeneity of the Saudi\nstate. Oil income has in some cases allowed for the creation of very efficient bureaucratic\nislands\u2014SAMA and the like, where select commoners played crucial roles\u2014but in\nothers has boosted neopatrimonialism. As long as the system expanded, oil created great\nleeway to freely design institutions and in very different ways. Generalizations about\nthe nature of the state are hence difficult. As political agency intervenes, rents do not\nautomatically create inefficiency and corruption. At the same time, rapidly increasing\nrents may create a temptation to build institutional fiefdoms, as these can be convenient\ndevices to cement coalitions within the elite. Again, this is not an automatic outcome,\nbut the record of other oil states indicates that it is a distinct possibility and yet one\noverlooked by rentier theories.170\nSarah Yizraeli contends that the management of family politics through handing over\ncontrol of functionally differentiated formal institutions to senior royal players is more\nmodern than the old patrimonialism under Ibn Sa\u2013ud and his first successor, centered\nmostly on the king\u2019s court. As soon as individual formal posts become royal fiefs of their\nown, this judgment might be questionable. The paradox of Saudi state development is that\nmodern, differentiated bureaucracy and royal patrimonialism have grown concurrently.\nN O T E S\nAuthor\u2019s note: I thank the Daimler Benz Foundation, my interviewees, and the archivists of Riyadh, Oxford,\nand Georgetown for their invaluable support.\n1Cf.
