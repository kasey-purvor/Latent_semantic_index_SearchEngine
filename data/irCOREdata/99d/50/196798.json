Responses to the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium,\nhowever, were reduced in p2xA\/B\/C\/D\/E null cells suggesting\nthat dP2X receptors play a role in intracellular calcium\nsignaling.\nPurinergic signaling is one of the most primitive forms of\neukaryotic cell communication with pharmacological evidence\nfor its existence in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates (1).\nReceptors that mediate responses to extracellular purines\ninclude both ligand gated ion channels (P2X receptors) and\nG-protein-coupled receptors (P2Y, adenosine and cAMP re-\nceptors). ATP is the exclusive endogenous ligand at mamma-\nlian P2X receptors, which consist of seven distinct subtypes\n(P2X1\u20137) that assemble at the cell surface as homo- or hetero-\ntrimeric channels and play key roles in a wide range of phys-\niological processes such as neurotransmission, platelet\naggregation, smooth muscle contraction, and immune cell\nfunction (2, 3). Definitive molecular and functional evidence\nfor P2X receptors has also been obtained in several lower\norganisms, including species of trematode (4), amoeba (5),\ngreen algae (6), choanoflagellate (6), and tardigrade (7), mak-\ning it clear that the emergence of P2X receptors was an early\nevent in eukaryotic evolution. What is less clear however is\nwhether the physiological roles of these lower organism P2X\nreceptors are analogous to the cell surface function of verte-\nbrate P2X receptors.\nThe amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has recently\nemerged as a potential model system for fundamental\naspects of purinergic signaling due to the simplicity and\ngenetic tractability of this organism, with the availability of\npowerful functional screens, and also due to the absence of\nP2X-like proteins in the genomes of other key model orga-\nnisms such as yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, andDrosophila.\nSequencing of the Dictyostelium genome (8) revealed the\npresence of five genes with weak homology to vertebrate P2X\nreceptors (named p2xA, p2xB, p2xC, p2xD, and p2xE in Dic-\ntybase (9)). Of these five genes p2xA shows the most homol-\nogy to vertebrate P2X receptors and was shown to encode an\nATP-gated ion channel when exogenously expressed in\nHEK293 cells (5). Interestingly, rather than being located on\nthe plasma membrane analogous to vertebrate P2X recep-\ntors, the native dP2XA protein was found to be localized to\nthe intracellular membranes of the contractile vacuole\nwhere it is thought to be required for osmoregulation (5),\nthus highlighting the possibility of potential novel intracel-\nlular roles for vertebrate P2X receptors.\nIn addition to the intracellular signaling mediated by\ndP2XA, Dictyostelium also possesses a purinergic signaling\nsystem for extracellular nucleotides more analogous to that\nfound in vertebrate cells. Using an apoaequorin-expressing\nstrain we have previously demonstrated that both extracel-\nlular ATP and ADP evoke a robust and rapid increase in\nintracellular Ca2\u0001 in Dictyostelium (10). The characteristics\nof this purinergic response are indicative of the involvement\nof an ionotropic P2X rather than a metabotropic P2Y-like\nreceptor, because it is dependent on extracellular Ca2\u0001 and\nis unaffected by ablation of either the G-protein subunit gene\nG\u0001 or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor gene iplA\n(10). However, there are notable differences compared with\nCa2\u0001 responses via vertebrate P2X receptors, including\n* This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (Project Grant\nWT081601MA).\nAuthor\u2019s Choice\u2014Final version full access.\n\u25a1S The on-line version of this article (available at http:\/\/www.jbc.org) contains\nsupplemental Figs.

We show\nthat dP2XB and dP2XE do correspond to ATP-gated channels\nbut could not obtain functional currents for dP2XC or dP2XD\nreceptors. Apart from a decrease in magnitude, the extracellu-\nlar purinergic response remained unaffected in quintuple p2x\nknock-out Dictyostelium, demonstrating that the cell surface\nATP\/ADP receptor is not a P2X channel. Indeed all five dP2X\nproteins proved to be intracellular, localized to the contractile\nvacuole membrane with the ligand binding domain facing the\nlumen. When exposed to distilled water, quintuple p2x null\ncells displayed a slight delay in their osmoregulatory response\nbut, in marked contrast to previous studies with p2xA null cells\n(5), were still capable of regulating their cell volume demon-\nstrating a minor and nonessential role for dP2X receptors in\nosmoregulation. Calcium responses to both calmidazolium and\nATP, however, were reduced in quintuple p2x null cells sug-\ngesting that dP2X receptors play a role in intracellular calcium\nsignaling.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nCloning of Dictyostelium P2X Receptors\u2014Oligonucleotide\nprimers (pairs 1\u20135, see Table 1) designed to amplify the coding\nregions of the five predicted Dictyostelium P2X receptor genes\n(DDB0238349, DDB0238356, DDB0238363, DDB0238366, and\nDDB0238352 for p2xA\u2013E, respectively) were utilized for re-\nverse transcription-PCR on cDNA prepared from Ax2 Dictyo-\nstelium. First strand cDNA was used directly as template in\nPCR reactions containing 200 \u0002M dNTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25\npmol of each primer, 1\u0002 Opti-Buffer (Bioline, UK), and 2.5\nunits of Bio-X-Act Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline). Thermal\ncycling consisted of 30 repetitions of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 56 \u00b0C for 1\nmin, and 72 \u00b0C for 1.5 min. PCR products were cloned into\npcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and independent clones were se-\nquenced on both strands.\nElectrophysiological Recordings\u2014Sense strand cRNA was\ngenerated from MluI-digested dP2X plasmids with a T7\nmMessage mMachineTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Manually\ndefolliculated stageVXenopus oocytes were injectedwith 50 ng\nof cRNA and stored at 18 \u00b0C inND96 buffer (96mMNaCl, 2mM\nKCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mMMgCl2, 5 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM\nHEPES, pH 7.6) prior to recording 3\u20137 days later. Two-elec-\ntrode voltage clamp recordings weremade fromdP2X-express-\ning Xenopus oocytes at room temperature using an Axoclamp\n900A amplifier with a Digidata 1440A data acquisition system\nand pClamp 10 acquisition software (Molecular Devices). For\nconstruction of concentration response data, the extracellular\nrecording solution (ND98K\u0001) consisted of 98 mM KCl, 1.8 mM\nBaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MES, pH 6.2. Membrane currents\nwere recorded at a holding potential of \u000370 mV. ATP (Mg2\u0001\nsalt, Sigma) was applied from a nearby U-tube perfusion sys-\ntem, whereas antagonists (PPADS and suramin (Sigma)),\nCuCl2, and ivermectin (Sigma) were bath perfused as well as\nbeing present at the appropriate concentration in the U-tube\napplication of ATP. For dP2XE reproducible currents were\nobtained with a 5-min recovery period between sequential\napplications of agonist allowing concentration response data to\nbe obtained sequentially in individual cells. Marked current\nrundown, however, occurred with dP2XA and dP2XB, which\nwas highly dependent on the previous history of ATP applica-\ntions. This prevented construction of concentration response\ndata in the same cells, and, to overcome this, a single application\nof agonist was made to 10\u201315 oocytes from the same batch for\neach concentration of agonist, and a mean peak response was\ntaken. Non-injected and water-injected oocytes tested from at\nleast five batches of oocytes gave no detectable currents in\nresponse to ATP or ADP application (tested at 3 mM). Concen-\ntration response data were fitted using GraphPad Prism 5.0\nsoftware (San Diego, CA).\nFor permeability ratio studies the external recording solution\nconsisted of: either NaCl, KCl, NH4Cl, or choline chloride at 98\nmM, 1.8 mM BaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM MES (pH 6.2).\nReversal potentials (Vrev) for currents in different test cation\nsolutions were obtained using a dual ramp protocol, which\nstepped from a holding potential of \u000370 mV to \u000170 mV for\n0.2 s followed by a ramp down to \u0003100 mV over 1.6 s and a\nramp up to \u000170 mV over 1.6 s before a step back to \u000370 mV.\nThis voltage protocol was first applied in the absence of ATP to\ncontrol for endogenous voltage-activated currents, and then in\nthe presence of ATP (3 mM) the two traces were superim-\nposed. The reversal potential was taken as the points where\nthe current traces crossed on the ramps (Fig. 4A). The dif-\nference between the two cross-over points obtained for each\ncell (up-ramp and down-ramp) was typically\u00042 mV, and the\nmean of the two values was taken as the reversal potential for\neach cell (n\u0003 6 cells). Relative permeability ratios for mono-\nvalent cations were calculated using Equation 1,\nPX\/PNa\u0004 exp\u0005\u0006VrevF\/RT\u0007 (Eq. 1)\nwhere F is Faraday\u2019s constant, R is the universal gas constant,\nand T is the absolute temperature.\nChloride permeability measurements were made in external\nsolutions where KCl was substituted with potassium gluconate\nso as to keep [K\u0001] constantwhile lowering [Cl\u0003]. Gluconate has\npreviously been show to be impermeable to human P2X5 chan-\nnels (11). Solutions consisted of 1.8 mM BaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5\nmM MES, and either 9.8 mM KCl plus 88.2 mM potassium glu-\nconate, 49 mM KCl plus 49 mM potassium gluconate, or 98 mM\nKCl (pH 6.2).

Relative permeability (PK\u0001\/\nPNa\u0001) values of 1.10 and 0.98, (as calculated above (Table 4))\nwere used for dP2XA and dP2XB, respectively.\nDictyostelium Culture and Transformation\u2014Ax2 Dictyoste-\nlium and transformants were grown axenically in HL-5 media\nat 22 \u00b0C. Growth medium of strains expressing apoaequorin\n(pPROF120 plasmid (13)), dP2X-eGFP, dP2X-RFP, or vatM-\nGFP (pDXA\/VatM-GFP (14))was supplementedwith 30\u0002g\/ml\nG418 and for p2x null mutants with 10\u0002g\/ml blasticidin S. Cell\ntransformations were essentially as described previously (10).\nGene Disruption\u2014The p2xB, p2xC, and p2xD single, and\np2xA\/B\/C\/D\/E quintuple null strains were produced in Ax2 by\nhomologous recombination using disruption vectors based on\npLPBLP (15). Flanking homology regions were generated by\nPCR using primer pairs 11\u201316 (Table 1) and cloned on either\nside of the blasticidin S resistance cassette (bsr) via the exoge-\nnous restriction endonuclease sites introduced by the primers\nduring amplification (5\b ApaI-HindIII and 3\b NotI-SacII). Dis-\nruption cassettes were liberated as ApaI\/SacII fragments, and\n15 \u0002g was used to transform Ax2 Dictyostelium. Independent\nnull strains were isolated from 96-well tissue culture plates in\naxenic medium plus 10 \u0002g\/ml blasticidin S as the selective\nagent. Gene disruptants were identified by PCR, using oligonu-\ncleotides located outside the disruption cassette andwithin bsr,\nwith Southern blot analysis performed to verify a single site of\nintegration (supplemental Fig. S1). To generate the quintuple\np2xA\/B\/C\/D\/E knock-out strain bsr was recycled by transient\nexpression of Cre recombinase (pDEX-NLS-cre (15)). Recom-\nbinants were isolated following 3\u20136 days selection in 30 \u0002g\/ml\nG418. Accurate recombination was verified by PCR, using oli-\ngonucleotides located either side of bsr.\nSouthern Blot Analysis\u2014HindIII- or EcoRV-digested genomic\nDNA was probed with \u0005-[32P]dCTP-labeled SacI-HindIII-re-\nstricted bsr. Hybridization was as described in a previous study\n(10).\nAequorin Assays\u2014In vivo reconstitution of aequorin was\nachieved as described previously (10). Luminescence signals\nwere recorded between 1 and 2 h after aequorin reconstitution\nusing a custom built luminometer (Cairn Research UK), with\n1.5 ml of stirred cell suspension. Agonists or lysis solution (75\n\u0002l) were delivered using the auto-injector of the luminometer\nso as to standardize the speed and force of injection between\nexperiments. For each experiment the total cell aequorin\ncontent was determined in at least 5 aliquots of cells by\ninjecting lysis solution (10 mM MOPS, 10 mM calcium ace-\ntate, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.0) to compare response mag-\nnitudes between experiments and strains as percent total\naequorin consumption.

Cells were then forced through a\ndouble layer of 5-\u0002m filters twice, which was sufficient to dis-\nrupt the cell membrane of themajority of cells while leaving the\nmembranes of intracellular organelles intact. Undisrupted cells\nwere pelleted by centrifugation (425\u0002 g, 5 min, and 4 \u00b0C), and\nintracellular organelles were enriched from the supernatant by\nfurther centrifugation at 18,000\u0002 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Pelleted\norganelles were then resuspended in proteinase K digestion\nbuffer (2 \u0002g of protein\/\u0002l) and digested with proteinase K (100\n\u0002g\/ml) for 30min at 22 \u00b0C. Control total protein digestion with\nproteinase K was achieved following lysis of organelle mem-\nbranes with 1% Triton X-100. Proteinase K-digested protein\n(typically 25\u0002g) wasmixed 50:50with gel sample buffer (50mM\nTris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mM dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol),\nheated for 2 min at 70 \u00b0C, separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel\nbefore transfer to nitrocellulose.

Reference differential interfer-\nence contrast images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S\nmicroscope (20\u0002 objective) and Openlab software before\nreplacement of HL5 media with distilled water after two brief\nwashes in distilled water. Differential interference contrast\nimages were then collected at 5-min intervals, and cell area was\nsubsequently measured for the same 20\u201340 cells from each\nimage using ImageJ analysis software.\nData Analysis\u2014Data are presented as means \n S.E.

Here we show\nthat dP2XB and dP2XE also represent ATP-gated ion channels\nand further characterize the permeation properties of dP2XA.\nNo nucleotide-evoked currents, however, could be recorded\nfrom dP2XC- or dP2XD-expressing oocytes tested under a\nrange of extracellular recording solutions and pH. The typical\nextracellular recording solution for the study of P2X ion chan-\nnel function in Xenopus oocytes is ND96 (pH 7.5) with 1.8 mM\nBaCl2 replacing the 1.8mMCaCl2 to\nprevent activation of endogenous\ncalcium-activated chloride chan-\nnels (20). In initial experiments\nusing this solution with dP2XB- or\ndP2XE-expressing oocytes we\nobtained no or very small (\u000450 nA)\ncurrents upon ATP application\n(tested up to 3 mM). Substitution of\nBaCl2 with CaCl2 or omission of\nMgCl2 in ND96 had no effect on\nthese very small current amplitudes.\nND96 with a more acid pH (pH 6.2)\nproduced slightly larger currents\n(Fig. 1A), but these were still small\n(160\n 45 nA for dP2XB and 696\n\n211 nA for dP2XE) in comparison to\nother non-vertebrate P2X channels\nexpressed in Xenopus oocytes (4, 7).\nSurprisingly, when Na\u0001 was\nreplaced with either NH4\u0001 or K\u0001 in\nthe extracellular recording solution\ncurrent amplitudes became much\nlarger (\u000b3\u20136 \u0002A) (Fig. 1) suggest-\ning that dP2XBanddP2XE channels\neither have lowNa\u0001 permeability or\nthat Na\u0001 in some way inhibited the\nefficacy of ATP to activate the chan-\nnel. Similar to dP2XB and dP2XE,\ncurrents through the dP2XA chan-\nnel were also significantly larger\n(p \u0004 0.05) when Na\u0001 was replaced\nwith K\u0001 (Fig. 1), however Na\u0001 inhi-\nbition in dP2XA was less pro-\nnounced than in dP2XB or dP2XE.\nAll chemicals were of analytical\ngrade (SigmaUltra) nevertheless, to\nconfirm thatNa\u0001 inhibitionwas not\ndue to trace contamination of metal\nions, \u201ctrace select\u201d NaCl (Fluka\n38979) was also used for dP2XB-ex-\npressing oocytes, and the Na\u0001 inhi-\nFIGURE 2.

In the absence of Na\u0001 ions, pH also\naffected current amplitudes with acidic pH (6.2) producing sig-\nnificantly larger current amplitudes than neutral or slightly\nalkaline pH (Fig. 2B). In subsequent experiments to further\ncharacterize the properties of dP2X channels we therefore rou-\ntinely used extracellular recording solution with K\u0001 substitut-\ning Na\u0001 and a pH of 6.2 (ND98K\u0001, see \u201cExperimental\nProcedures\u201d).\nATP evoked inward currents in dP2XA-, dP2XB-, and\ndP2XE-expressing oocytes that decayed during the continued\npresence of agonist (Fig. 2A) and showed EC50 values of 97, 266,\nand 511\u0002M, respectively (Fig. 2E and Table 2). The time course\nof ATP responses at the three channels was quite similar, and\ncurrent decay (measured as time from peak current to 50%\npeak) was not significantly different. Currents through dP2XA\nchannels however had a faster rise time (p \u0004 0.01) than either\ndP2XB or dP2XE (Table 2). \u0001,\u0006-Imido-ATP has previously\nbeen reported to be a more potent agonist than ATP at dP2XA\n(5). Similarly, under our experimental conditions \u0001,\u0006-imido-\nATP was \u000b30-fold more potent at dP2XA with an EC50 of 3.1\n\u0002M. We therefore tested this ATP analogue on the other four\ndP2X receptors. \u0001,\u0006-Imido-ATP was a full agonist at dP2XB\nandwas 3-foldmore potent thanATPwith an EC50 of 85\u0002M. In\ncontrast to dP2XAand dP2XB,\u0001,\u0006-imido-ATPwas aweak par-\ntial agonist at dP2XE producing a maximal response only\n22.3\n 6.4% that of ATP (Fig. 2D). Similar to ATP, \u0001,\u0006-imido-\nATP produced no response at dP2XC and dP2XD. We also\ntested UTP, UDP, UMP, uridine, GTP, GDP, GMP, guanosine,\nCTP, CDP, CMP, cytidine, ADP, AMP, adenosine, cAMP, and\ncGMP (all at 300 \u0002M) at all five dP2X receptors. None of these\npotential agonists produced currents in any of the dP2X recep-\ntors demonstrating that dP2XA, dP2XB, and dP2XE are highly\nselective for ATP.\nEffects of PPADS, Suramin, andCopper at dP2XBand dP2XE\u2014\nThe general P2 receptor antagonists suramin and PPADS have\npreviously been shown to be ineffective at dP2XA (5). Similarly,\ncurrents through dP2XB and dP2XE were also not affected by\neither compound tested at concentrations up to 100 \u0002M in\nXenopus oocytes (Fig. 3). dP2XB and dP2XE did, however, dif-\nfer from dP2XA in their sensitivity to copper. dP2XA currents\nwhen expressed in HEK293 cells are blocked by nanomolar\nconcentrations of copper (IC50 40 nM) (5). A similar inhibition\nFIGURE 3. dP2XB and dP2XE receptors are not inhibited by copper, sura-\nmin, or PPADS.Peak current responses for each receptorwere normalized to\nthemean of the control response to 3mM ATP with no inhibitor present (n\t\n6\u201310oocytes for eachdatapoint). CuCl2 (100nM), suramin (100\u0002M), or PPADS\n(100 \u0002M) were present in both the bath solution (5-min incubation prior to\nagonist application) and the 3 mM ATP solution. Unlike dP2XA (5) (**, p \u0004\n0.01), dP2XB and dP2XE are not inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of\ncopper, and neither receptor is sensitive to the common P2 receptor antag-\nonists PPADS and suramin.\nFIGURE 4. dP2XA and dP2XB are permeable to chloride ions.

The macrocyclic lactone ivermectin, which has\nbeen shown to potentiate P2X receptor currents in human and\nrat P2X4 receptors (20, 21), and invertebrate P2X receptors\nfrom Schistosomamansoni (4) andHypsidius dujardini (7) had\nno effect on theDictyostelium dP2XA, -B, or -E receptors (data\nnot shown).\nRelative Permeability of Cations through dP2X Receptors\u2014\nCurrents through dP2XB and dP2XE are small when Na\u0001 was\nthe major cation in the extracellular recording solution (Fig.\n1A) and to determine whether this was due to a low Na\u0001 per-\nmeability we determined reversal potentials of dP2X receptors\nin different extracellular solutions by applying a dual ramp pro-\ntocol from \u000170 to \u0003100 mV in the presence and absence of 3\nmM ATP (Fig. 4A). Changes in reversal potential were used to\ncalculate the relative permeability ratio of the test cation toNa\u0001\n(see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d). As control we used the\nhuman P2X2 receptor and obtained a permeability ratio for\nPK\u0001\/PNa\u0001 of 1.05 \n 0.04 (n \t 8), which is consistent with pre-\nviously published data (22). PK\u0001\/PNa\u0001 values for dP2X receptors\nwere 1.10 \n 0.04, 0.98 \n 0.03, and 1.56 \n 0.04 for dP2XA,\ndP2XB, and dP2XE, respectively, showing that lowNa\u0001 perme-\nability was not the underlying cause of current inhibition in\ndP2XB and dP2XE currents recorded in ND96 solution. dP2X\nreceptors weremore permeable to NH4\u0001 than either Na\u0001 or K\u0001\nions and less permeable to choline (Table 4).\ndP2XA and dP2XB Receptors Are Permeable to Chloride\u2014\nThe relatively negative reversal potentials for dP2XA and\ndP2XB in 98mMK\u0001 comparedwith dP2XE (Table 3) suggested\ndifferences in ionic permeability.We therefore investigated the\npossibility of chloride permeability in dP2X channels by substi-\ntution of KCl in the extracellular recording solutionwith potas-\nsium gluconate thereby reducing [Cl\u0003]out while [K\u0001]out\nremained constant. If a channel is impermeable to Cl\u0003 then\nreduction of [Cl\u0003]out, while the concentration of other perme-\nable ions remains constant, would not be expected to alter the\nreversal potential. This was the case for dP2XE where a plot of\nreversal potential against [Cl\u0003]out essentially produced a hori-\nzontal line (Fig. 4B and Table 3) showing that dP2XE is not\npermeable to Cl\u0003. With dP2XA and dP2XB, however, reversal\npotentials shifted to more positive values with decreasing con-\ncentrations of [Cl\u0003]out demonstrating Cl\u0003 permeability in\nthese channels. As an estimate of the relative Cl\u0003 permeabil-\nity for dP2XA and dP2XB we used the Goldman-Hodgkin-\nKatz equation to calculate theoretical shifts in reversal\npotential given relative permeability values for dP2XA and\ndP2XB of 1.10 and 0.98 (Table 4), respectively. For dP2XA a\nrelative chloride permeability of 1 gave a close correlation to\nthe experimental data while for dP2XB a relative Cl\u0003 perme-\nability of 2 was required to match the experimental data\n(dotted lines, Fig. 4B).\nThe Extracellular Purinergic Response Remains after Abla-\ntion of all Five p2x Genes\u2014By using single gene ablation, we\npreviously ruled out dP2XA and dP2XE as the cell surface\nreceptors exclusively mediating the Dictyostelium calcium\nresponse to extracellular purine nucleotides (10). We therefore\ngenerated knock-out strains for the p2xB, p2xC, and p2xD\ngenes to complete the set of individual gene knock-outs for the\nfive Dictyostelium P2X receptors. We also generated a quintu-\nple knock-out strain (p2xA\/p2xB\/p2xC\/p2xD\/p2xE-) devoid of\nany dP2X receptors by sequentially disrupting all five p2x\ngenes. No obvious morphological phenotype was apparent in\nany of the single or quintuple p2xnull strains. Cells grew in both\nHL5media and on bacterial plates andwere also able to develop\nnormally upon starvation to form fruiting bodies. The quintu-\nple p2x null strain, however, did grow slightly slower than wild\ntype in shaking axenic cultures with a doubling time \u000b40%\ngreater than wild type.\nResponses to extracellular ATP persisted in p2xB, p2xC, and\np2xD single null strains with no alteration in the kinetics of the\nresponse (Fig. 5A) or potency (pEC50 \t 5.49 \n 0.03, 5.56 \n\n0.03, 5.45 \n 0.03, and 5.49 \n 0.02 for p2xB, p2xC, p2xD, and\nWT strains, respectively) (Fig. 5B). The absolute magnitude of\nresponses, however, expressed as a percentage of total aequorin\nconsumption, were 26- 50% lower in single p2x null strains\ncompared with wild type (Fig. 5D).\nTo rule out the possibility of functional compensation from\nremaining dP2X receptors in the single null strains we also\nassayed the quintuple knock-out strain, which lacked all five\ndP2X receptors. Again the endogenous response to extracellu-\nlar ATP persisted in this quintuple (p2xA\/p2xB\/p2xC\/p2xD\/\np2xE) knock-out with no change in potency (pEC50 \t 5.62 \n\n0.03) (Fig. 5B) and a similar time course of the response (Fig.\n5A). Similarly, the equipotency of ADP to ATP was maintained\nin all single and the quintuple knock-out strains. However, the\nreduction in response magnitude observed in the single p2x\nnull strains was greater in the quintuple knock-out with a 66%\nreduction inmagnitude comparedwithwild type (Fig. 5D). This\nreduction in response magnitude could potentially be ex-\nplained by the removal of ATP\/ADP-sensitive dP2X receptors\nat the cell surface, or alternatively due to disruption of subse-\nquent downstream intracellular calcium signaling mediated by\ndP2X receptors but initiated by the activation of a non-P2X cell\nTABLE 3\nReversal potential of ATP evoked currents in different extracellular recording solutions\nChannel 98 mM K\u0003 98 mM Na\u0003 98 mM NH4\u0003 98 mM choline 49 mM gluconate 88.2 mM gluconate\nmV\ndP2XA \u000310.2\n 1.0 \u000312.6\n 0.9 4.0\n 1.5 \u000329.4\n 2.3 \u00035.0\n 0.8 1.7\n 0.6\ndP2XB \u000316.6\n 0.8 \u000315.8\n 0.7 0.6\n 1.3 \u000330.0\n 5.0 \u00036.3\n 0.9 4.4\n 1.8\ndP2XE \u00036.6\n 0.6 \u000317.6\n 1.0 \u00032.90\n 1.3 \u000332.1\n 1.8 \u00035.4\n 0.5 \u00036.0\n 1.6\nTABLE 4\nPermeability ratios of different ions through Dictyostelium P2X\nchannels\nChannel PK\u0003\/PNa\u0003 PNH4\u0003\/PNa\u0003 Pcholine\/PNa\u0003\ndP2XA 1.10\n 0.04 1.97\n 0.12 0.52\n 0.04\ndP2XB 0.98\n 0.03 1.93\n 0.09 0.63\n 0.07\ndP2XE 1.56\n 0.04 1.81\n 0.09 0.57\n 0.04\nDictyostelium P2X Receptors\nDECEMBER 11, 2009\u2022VOLUME 284\u2022NUMBER 50 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 35233\n at Leicester University Library, on January 19, 2011\nw\nw\nw\n.jbc.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nsurface purinergic receptor.

Western\nblot analyses of the products of protease treatment using anti-\nSTREP or anti-GFP antibodies demonstrated that proteinase K\nwas able to fully digest the C-terminal region of the receptor\ncontaining the eGFP tag while the inter-transmembrane\nloop encompassing the STREP tag remained protected (Fig.\n7D). Prior treatment of vacuoles with Triton X-100 resulted\nin proteinase K digestion of both epitope tags, because dis-\nruption of the vacuole membrane will allow proteinase K\naccessibility to both the cytoplasmic and lumen sides of the\nvacuole. The orientation indicated by these results puts the\npredicted agonist binding site within the lumen of the vacu-\nole and the N and C termini within the cytoplasm. In addi-\ntion to a STREP-tagged digestion product corresponding in\nsize to the full inter-transmembrane region (\u000b30 kDa), a\nsmaller product of \u000b20 kDa con-\ntaining the STREP tag was also\nobserved. This smaller band often\nrepresented the major of the two\ndigestion products and occasion-\nally, when a higher proteinase\nK:protein ratio was used (Fig. 7D,\ngel 3), was the only digestion prod-\nuct detected. The presence of this\nsmaller \u000b20-kDa band suggests\nthat part of the inter-transmem-\nbrane region is exposed to the\nenzyme in the extra-organelle\nenvironment, possibly via a re-en-\ntrant loop.

The presence of this\nband, however, did not interfere\nwith the interpretation of the pro-\nteinase K protection results.\ndP2X Null Strains Are Still Capa-\nble of Osmoregulation\u2014p2xA null\nDictyostelium have previously been\ndescribed to be incapable of regu-\nlating their volume in hypotonic\nconditions with cells continuing to\nswell rather than showing an\nosmoregulatory decrease in volume leading to the conclu-\nsion that dP2XA is required for osmoregulation (5). The\np2xA and other single null strains described in this study,\nhowever, did not show any noticeable differences in their\nsensitivity to hypotonic conditions. Each single p2x null\nstrain behaved in a similar manner to wild type, swelling\ninitially over the first 10 min after exposure to water and\nthen recovering their volume by 60 min. Even complete\nabsence of all five dP2X receptors in the p2xA\/B\/C\/D\/E null\nstrain did not prevent cells from undergoing osmoregula-\ntion. Like wild type, p2xA\/B\/C\/D\/E null cells swelled by\n15\u201320% within the first 10 min of exposure to water before\nundergoing a regulatory decrease in cell volume (Fig. 8).\nThere was, however, a delay of \u000b15 min in the onset of this\nregulatory decrease in volume in the p2xA\/B\/C\/D\/E cells,\nbut the subsequent rate of volume decrease was very similar\nto wild-type cells (Fig. 8C).

Given the\nlow sequence similarity with vertebrate P2X receptors (be-\ntween 8.5 and 18.8% amino acid identity with human P2X1\u20137\nreceptors), it is remarkable that, similar to dP2XA, these two\nDictyostelium P2X channels are still exclusively selective for\nATP over other nucleotides. Whether the agonist binding site\nin the Dictyostelium P2X receptors\nis analogous to their vertebrate\ncounterparts is uncertain. The\nrecently solved crystal structure for\nzebrafish P2X4 is in the agonist-un-\nbound state (24), and the definitive\nlocalization of the ATP binding site\ntherefore remains unknown. ATP\nbinding in vertebrate P2X receptors\nis known to occur between adjacent\nsubunits (24, 25) and is thought to\ninvolve lysine residues that coordi-\nnate phosphate binding (26), an\nNFR motif that binds adenine\/ri-\nbose and an FT motif also involved\nin agonist action (27). Similarities in\nATP binding for dP2XA and verte-\nbrate P2X receptors have been dem-\nonstrated by site-directedmutagen-\nesis where Lys67 (equivalent to\nhuman P2X1 Lys70) and Lys289\n(equivalent to human P2X1 Lys309)\nboth disrupted ATP evoked cur-\nrents when mutated to alanine (5).\nHowever dP2XB lacks the first of\nthese lysine residues and dP2XE\nlacks both lysines. It is therefore sur-\nprising that dP2XB and dP2XE are\nstill gated by ATP given that the\nequivalent lysine residues in verte-\nbrates are thought to coordinate\nbinding of ATP phosphatemoieties,\nsuggesting that other regions of the\nreceptor must also be important in\nagonist recognition.\nAn unusual property of the dP2X\nreceptors, particularly dP2XB, is the\ninhibition of current amplitude by\nNa\u0001 (Fig. 1,A andB). The small cur-\nrents in the presence of high Na\u0001\nwere not a result of lowNa\u0001 perme-\nability, because PK\u0001\/PNa\u0001 was\nshown to be\u000b1 (Table 4). It is there-\nfore likely that Na\u0001 exerts some\nform of allosteric modulation on dP2X channel function possi-\nbly by affecting the mean open time by a mechanism similar to\nthat proposed for human P2X7 (28). Permeability to chloride is\nalso an unusual feature for P2X receptors, however, this is not\nunique, because chicken and human P2X5 receptors have also\nbeen shown to pass chloride (PCl\u0003\/PNa\u0001 \t 0.5) (11, 29). Inter-\nestingly, the dP2X receptors differed in their permeability to\nchloride with dP2XA and dP2XB being permeable but dP2XE\nnot (Fig. 4). The relative permeability of Cl\u0003 to Na\u0001 was esti-\nmated to be\u000b2 for dP2XB and\u000b1 for dP2XA. Although these\nvalues can only be taken as a rough estimate, because the actual\nintracellular concentrations of ions in the batches of oocytes\nused was not determined, the data clearly demonstrate that\ndP2XB ismore permeable toCl\u0003 than dP2XA.

B, overview of the\nprotease protection assay. Cells were disrupted by passage through a 5-\u0002m pore membrane so as to keep\nintracellular organelles intact prior to exposure to proteinase K (100 \u0002g\/ml). The inability of this enzyme to\ncross themembrane of intact organelles allows a distinction to bemade between protein elements that reside\nin the cytosol (exposed proteinase K) and those that reside within the vacuole lumen (protected fromprotein-\nase K). The left side of the diagram depicts the scenario if the orientation was such that the inter-transmem-\nbrane domain is exposed to the cytosol (the STREP tag would be digested while the GFP tag would remain\nintact). The right side depicts the converse where the inter-transmembrane domain resides inside the vacuole\nlumen resulting in digestion of theGFP tagwhile STREP remains intact.C, representative confocal image of the\ndual-tagged dP2XA protein in vegetative cells confirming that contractile vacuole localization has not been\ndisrupted by insertion of epitope tags. Scale bar is 5 \u0002m. D, Western blot analysis of dual-tagged dP2XA\nincubated in the presence and absence of proteinase K. Both GFP and STREP epitopes are detectable in the\nfull-length undigested receptor. However, after proteinase K digestion only the STREP epitope remains intact.\nA short pre-treatment with 1% Triton X-100, to disrupt vacuole membranes, permitted proteinase K access to\nthe lumen and digestion of the STREP tag. An additional band containing the STREP epitope smaller than the\nexpected \u000b30 kDa was also detected (gels 2 and 3). This band was often the most prominent of the two\ndigestion products observed and in samples where a higher proteinase K:protein ratio was used represented\nthe only band detected (gel 3). E, loss of the GFP epitope following proteinase K digestion of intact vacuoles\ncontaining dP2XB\u2013eGFP confirms an equivalent orientation for all five receptors. In some undigested samples\nthe GFP antibody also detected a lower molecular weight protein of unknown origin (prominent in dP2XC\nexample gel and also visible in dP2XB gel and gel 1).\nDictyostelium P2X Receptors\n35236 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 284\u2022NUMBER 50\u2022DECEMBER 11, 2009\n at Leicester University Library, on January 19, 2011\nw\nw\nw\n.jbc.org\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nthis Cl\u0003 permeability is unclear, because the ionic composition\nof the contractile vacuole remains largely undetermined,\nalthough a vacuolar protein pump (14), the Ca2\u0001ATPase PAT1\n(30), and the NH4\u0001 transporter AmtB (31) have all been local-\nized to the contractile vacuole membrane. In respect to the\nlatter, the relatively high permeability of the dP2X proteins to\nNH4\u0001 (Table 4) may have physiological significance.\nThe lack of functional currents in dP2XC or dP2XD could\npossibly be due to inappropriate post-translational processing\nof Dictyostelium proteins in Xenopus or gating of these chan-\nnels by non-nucleotide ligands. Alternatively, dP2XC and\ndP2XD may require co-expression with other dP2X family\nmembers to form heteromeric channels (32, 33) or require the\npresence of one or more accessory proteins. Co-expression of\ndP2XC together with dP2XD in oocytes did not produce ATP\/\nADP-evoked currents, and co-expression of either channel\nwith dP2XB resulted in a dominant\nnegative phenotype with loss of\nATP-gated currents (data not\nshown). Whether this dominant\nnegative effect represents a physio-\nlogical mechanism by which\ndP2XC\/D can regulate the activity\nof the other dP2X proteins remains\nto be determined.\nColocalization of RFP tagged\ndP2XB\u2013E with eGFP-tagged vatM\n(14) on the membranes of the con-\ntractile vacuole (Fig. 6, B and C),\ndemonstrated that, similar to\ndP2XA (5), dP2XB, -C, -D, and -E\nreceptors are also localized to this\nintracellular organelle. The low\npotency of ATP at dP2XA, -B, and\n-E receptors, ranging from EC50\n\u000b100 to 500 \u0002M (Table 2), is per-\nhaps a reflection of this intracellular\nlocalization, because the concentra-\ntion of ATP will typically be much\nhigher within the cell than in the\nextracellular environment. Key to\nunderstanding the functional roles\nof dP2X receptors in contractile\nvacuole function is determining the\nmembrane orientation, because this\nwill provide information on both\nthe potential origin of agonist acti-\nvating the receptor and the regula-\ntory\/modulatory influences that the\ndifferent domains of the receptor\nare exposed to. By using a protease\nprotection assay on tagged recep-\ntors we demonstrated that the\ntransmembrane loop region con-\ntaining the agonist binding site lies\nwithin the lumenof the vacuole (Fig.\n7). The source of ATP within the\nvacuole to activate these receptors,\nhowever, is currently unknown. One speculative possibility is\nthatATP containing vesicleswithin the cytoplasmcould fusewith\nthe vacuolemembrane to releaseATP into the lumen in amanner\nanalogous to the exocytosis of ATP in vertebrate astrocytes (34).\nSuch amechanismwould likely be regulated by calciumand could\npossibly involve the Dictyostelium SNARE protein Vamp7B,\nwhich has recently been shown to be present on the contractile\nvacuolemembrane (35). Alternatively, analogous to plasmamem-\nbrane pannexin 1 function in vertebrates (36), the vacuole mem-\nbranemaycontainchannelscapableofpassingATPfromthecyto-\nplasm to the vacuole lumen. It is also feasible, as has been recently\ndemonstrated in phagosomes (37, 38), that active transport of\nADP could occur across the vacuole membrane with subsequent\nconversion to ATPwithin the lumen.\nThe finding that all five members of the Dictyostelium P2X\nfamily have an intracellular localization was unexpected,\nFIGURE 8. dP2X receptors are not essential for osmoregulation.

Consistent with an\nintracellular rather than cell surface function for the entire\ndP2X receptor family, responses to extracellular ATP\/ADP\nremained largely unaffected in the quintuple p2x knock-out\nstrain with overlapping concentration response curves and\ntime course of response (Fig. 5, A and B). A decrease in the\nmagnitude of the extracellular purinergic response was\nobserved in p2x null strains (Fig. 5D). However, it is unlikely\nthat this decrease is a direct result of loss of dP2X channel\nactivity at the cell surface, because themagnitude of the calcium\nresponse evoked by the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium\nwas also decreased in the absence of dP2X receptors (Fig. 5F). A\nmore likely explanation for the reduction in magnitude of both\nATP\/ADP and calmidazolium responses in p2x null strains is\nthat dP2X receptors are involved in facilitating intracellular cal-\ncium signaling. The contractile vacuole is primarily an osmo-\nregulatory organelle, however, recent studies have also sug-\ngested that it additionally acts as a Ca2\u0001 store involved in\nintracellular Ca2\u0001 signaling (39). It is therefore conceivable that\ndP2X receptors act as the calcium release channels from this\nstore. Hence, although dP2X proteins do not represent the cell\nsurface receptors directly activated by extracellular ATP\/ADP,\ntheymay play a role in subsequent downstream signaling events\nby facilitating release of calcium from intracellular stores.\nThe generation of a quintuple p2x null strain also allowed us\nto directly assess the importance of dP2X receptors in osmo-\nregulation. Previous studies on p2xA null Dictyostelium re-\nported that these cells were incapable of regulating their cell\nvolume in water (5). It was therefore unexpected that the five\nsingle p2x null strains generated in this study showed no obvi-\nous osmoregulatory defects (supplemental Fig. S2). Even the\ncomplete absence of all five dP2X proteins in the quintuple p2x\nnull strain did not prevent cells from undergoing an osmoreg-\nulatory decrease in cell volume after initially swelling in water.\nThese cells, however, did show a delay of \u000b15 min compared\nwith wild type in the onset of a regulatory decrease in volume,\nbut the rate of the subsequent decrease in volume was very\nsimilar to that of the wild-type cells (Fig. 8). This is in marked\ncontrast to the behavior of the p2xA null cells described by\nFountain and co-workers (5), which showed no regulatory\ndecrease in volume and a\u000b50% increase in size after 60 min in\nwater. Similar to this previous study we also found copper to\ninhibit the osmoregulatory response in wild-type cells (Fig. 8).\nWe confirm that copper inhibits dP2XA channel function (Fig.\n3). However, the effects of copper on osmoregulation cannot be\nby inhibition of dP2XA as had been previously claimed (5),\nbecause copper also inhibits the quintuple p2x null strain,\nwhich is devoid of P2X receptors. Our results call into question\nthe importance of dP2X receptor function in osmoregulation.\nThe fact that quintuple p2x null cells are able to undergo an\nosmoregulatory response demonstrates that these receptors\nare not required. However, the slight delay in the onset of the\nosmoregulatory response indicates that they may play a minor\nrole.\nThis study has further highlighted the usefulness of Dictyos-\ntelium as amodel system for purinergic signaling. In addition to\nelucidation of the novel intracellular roles played by intracellu-\nlar P2X receptors and structure function studies comparing\nweakly related archetypal dP2X receptors with their vertebrate\ncounterparts, future studies in this model organism may also\nyield some surprises, because even in the complete absence of\ndP2X receptors, a robust purinergic calcium response to extra-\ncellular ATP\/ADPpersists. This, together with the fact that extra-\ncellular purinergic signaling is also unaffected in iplA andG\u0001 null\ncells (10), which would be contrary to the involvement of a\nmetabotropic P2Y receptor, suggests that a novel type of puriner-\ngic receptor or signaling mechanism exists in this organism.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We are grateful to David Traynor for advice\nregarding knock-out generation and to Paul Fisher for the apoae-\nquorin plasmid.\nREFERENCES\n1.
