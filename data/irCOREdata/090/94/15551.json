Introduction\n[2] Three decades of satellite surveillance shows that\nArctic Ocean sea ice reached a record level of reduction\nin 2007, surpassing the previous absolute minimum (2005)\nby more than 1.4 million km2 [Kerr, 2007]. Notwithstand-\ning the importance of these observations, a proper under-\nstanding of recent sea ice reduction [Nghiem et al., 2007;\nSerreze et al., 2007; Comiso et al., 2008] requires a long-\nterm perspective exceeding the past three decades. Here, we\ndocument the chronology of the oldest sea ice in the\nNorthern Hemisphere, the sea-ice ice shelves of northern\nEllesmere Island (Figure 1). Prior to this study, the age of\nthe ice shelves was poorly constrained, rendering unknown\nthe broader significance of their ongoing reduction. Here\nwe clarify the age of the Arctic ice shelves using a total of\n69 radiocarbon ages obtained on samples of Holocene\n(10,000 yr BP-present) driftwood transported across the\nArctic Ocean and deposited on northern Ellesmere Island.\nA hiatus in driftwood deposition from the mid-Holocene to\npresent documents the formation of widespread multiyear\nlandfast sea ice. These findings make the ice shelves several\nthousands of years older than originally proposed.\n[3] The recent reduction of Arctic Ocean pack ice along\nthe coast of northern Alaska and the Yukon has contributed\nto the earlier removal of landfast sea ice there [Mahoney\net al., 2007]. Assuming that this relationship holds true for\nnorthern Ellesmere Island, then the Holocene history of ice\nshelf formation and break-up should also serve as a proxy\nfor adjacent Arctic Ocean sea ice variability. The antiquity\nand ongoing removal of these ice shelves serves to amplify\nthe significance of modern sea ice reduction documented by\nsatellite surveillance of the Arctic Ocean.\n2. Study Area\n[4] The ice shelves of northern Ellesmere Island (Figure 1)\nare unique in the Northern Hemisphere and at the\nsubmission of this paper (April 2008) they covered about\n950 km2. These included the Markham, Ward Hunt and\nPetersen ice shelves that are composed of multiyear\nlandfast sea ice sustained by the basal accretion of brackish\nseawater and intermittent years of net snow accumulation\n[Hattersley-Smith et al., 1969; Lyons et al., 1971; Jeffries,\n1987; Jeffries et al., 1991]. Therefore, they are distinct from\nglacier ice shelves [Lemmen et al., 1988]. However, the\nMilne and Serson ice shelves have a significant component\nof glacier ice and therefore are classified as composite ice\nshelves [Lemmen et al., 1988; Narod et al., 1988].\n[5] These modern ice shelves are recognized to be\nremnants of a much more extensive \u2018\u2018Ellesmere Ice Shelf\u2019\u2019\nfirst described by late 19th century sledging parties [Nares,\n1878; Peary, 1907] (Figure 1). Their accounts refer to a\n600 km-long platform of sea ice attached to the coast,\ndescribed as having \u2018\u2018long prairie-like swells at its surface\u2019\u2019\n[Peary, 1907, p. 181]. This description is consistent with the\nsurface topography of modern ice shelves that display\ndistinctive, parallel ridges and troughs (Figure S1 in the\nauxiliary material1). These sledging trips across northern\nEllesmere Island coincided with the end of the Little Ice\nAge (LIA; 1600\u20131900 A.D.), an interval of climate deteri-\noration favouring widespread expansion of snow and ice\nacross the Canadian High Arctic [Evans and England, 1992;\nLevesque and Svoboda, 1999; Wolken et al., 2005].\n1Auxiliary materials are available in the HTML. doi:10.1029\/\n2008GL034470.\nGEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L19502, doi:10.1029\/2008GL034470, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta,\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada.\n2Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Directorate, Natural\nResources Canada, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.\n3Pacific Geoscience Centre, Geological Survey of Canada, Sidney,\nBritish Columbia, Canada.\n4Malcolm Pirnie, Inc., Sacramento, California, USA.\n5Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0094-8276\/08\/2008GL034470$05.00\nL19502 1 of 5\n[6] Systematic investigations of the ice shelves followed\nafter aircraft surveillance in 1946 discovered gigantic \u2018\u2018ice\nislands\u2019\u2019 up to 700 km2 in the Arctic Ocean that were initially\nof unknown provenance [Koenig et al., 1952]. These were\nsubsequently traced to northern Ellesmere Island where the\nsurface topography of several ice shelves matched that of the\nice islands. Mapping of the ice shelves based on aerial\nphotographs obtained in 1959\/60 indicated that the ice\nshelves then covered approximately 2100 km2 and extended\nup to 16 km into the Arctic Ocean. At this time, the total area\nof identified \u2018ice islands\u2019 in the Arctic Ocean, including the\nchannels of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA),\nwas about 2500 km2 [Crary, 1958]. Hence, by 1960, the\ncombined area of ice shelves and ice islands was approxi-\nmately 4600 km2, roughly half the estimated area of the\n\u2018\u2018Ellesmere Ice Shelf\u2019\u2019 at the end of the LIA [Vincent et al.,\n2001] (Figure 1). Since then, the largest ice shelf reduction\ninvolved the calving of 600 km2 from the Ward Hunt Ice\nShelf during 1961\/62 [Hattersley-Smith, 1963; Holdsworth,\n1970]. Additional fracturing of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf\nbetween 2000 and 2002 was reported based on RADARSAT\nimagery and subsequent fieldwork [Mueller et al., 2003],\nemphasizing its increasing vulnerability to full removal,\nlike the Ayles Ice Shelf in 2005 [Copland et al., 2007]\n(Figure 1). During the summer of 2008, the Markham Ice\nShelf was also removed, whereas the Serson and Ward Hunt\nice shelves underwent reductions of 122 and 22 km2,\nrespectively (L. Copeland, personal communication, 2008).\n3. Methods\n[7] Forty-seven new radiocarbon dates, utilising acceler-\nator mass spectrometry (AMS), were obtained on postgla-\ncial driftwood collected inland of Ward Hunt Ice Shelf and\nfrom five adjacent fiords occupied today by multiyear\nlandfast sea ice (Clements Markham Inlet, M\u2019Clintock Inlet,\nYelverton Inlet, Phillips Inlet, and Disraeli Fiord; Figure 1).\nThese new dates add significantly to a total of 22 previously\nreported driftwood ages from the north coast of Ellesmere\nIsland. The chronology of driftwood deposition records\nintervals when both Arctic Ocean surface currents and\nseasonally ice-free fiords allowed driftwood to enter. Pres-\nervation of this driftwood record was favoured by its\nentrapment on marine shorelines that were subsequently\nelevated from the sea by postglacial emergence. Periods\nlacking driftwood deposition imply the non-availability of\ndriftwood-bearing sea ice by ocean currents and\/or blockage\nof the northern Ellesmere Island coast by multiyear landfast\nsea ice. The youngest driftwood samples provide maxi-\nmum-limiting ages for the inception of the sea shelves and\nmultiyear landfast sea ice now separating that driftwood\nfrom the Arctic Ocean.\n[8] The delivery and deposition of driftwood on northern\nEllesmere Island is affected by four variables. These are: 1)\nthe influx of driftwood into the Arctic Ocean from north-\nward flowing rivers in the circum-Arctic region [Dyke et al.,\n1997]; 2) the availability of sea ice to raft wood across the\nArctic Ocean during its three-year voyage, without which it\nwould become water-logged and sink [Ha\u00a8ggblom, 1982]; 3)\nthe presence of favourable ocean currents directing drift-\nwood to northern Ellesmere Island from source areas mainly\nin Russia [Dyke et al., 1997]; and 4) the lack of ice shelves\nand multiyear landfast sea ice along the northern Ellesmere\nIsland coast permitting driftwood deposition [Crary, 1960].\nWe assume that throughout the Holocene the rate of\ndriftwood incursion into the Arctic Ocean has remained\nFigure 1. The ice shelves of northern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada. The dashed black line marks the probable\nextent of the \u2018\u2018Ellesmere Ice Shelf\u2019\u2019 in 1906 [Vincent et al., 2001]. The Ayles and Markham ice shelves (cross-hatched)\nwere removed from the coast in August 2005 [Copland et al., 2007], and August, 2008, respectively (D. R. Mueller,\nSummer 2008 loss of Arctic ice shelves, available from http:\/\/www.people.trentu.ca\/\u0001dmueller\/iceshelfloss2008\/, 2008\n(accessed 4 September 2008)).\nL19502 ENGLAND ET AL.: RECORD OF ARCTIC OCEAN SEA ICE L19502\n2 of 5\nsimilar (because the circumpolar boreal forest has occupied\nthe Arctic Ocean drainage throughout this interval) and that\nthere has been sufficient sea ice to transport driftwood to\nnorthern Ellesmere Island.\n[9] Most driftwood is transported across the Arctic Ocean\nby sea ice entrained in the Transpolar Drift that originates\non the continental shelves of northern Russia [Dyke et al.,\n1997]. During the Holocene, the Transpolar Drift has had\nthree different configurations, ultimately controlled by\natmospheric circulation [Dyke et al., 1997; Tremblay et\nal., 1997]: 1) an eastward routing through Fram Strait when\ndriftwood is delivered to the European Arctic, 2) a westward\nrouting when driftwood is delivered to the CAA, including\nnorthern Ellesmere Island, and 3) a split routing when\ndriftwood is delivered less abundantly to both 1 and 2,\nabove. Since deglaciation, approximately 9500 cal yr BP,\ndriftwood has been deposited on northern Ellesmere Island\nbut more abundantly since 4500 cal yr BP when a westward\nshift in the Transpolar Drift is proposed [Dyke et al., 1997].\nThus, from 4500 cal yr BP to present, northern Ellesmere\nIsland was geographically disposed to driftwood delivery,\nrendering its history of deposition a useful proxy for the\npresence or absence of ice shelves. Below, we summarize\nthe new driftwood ages and discuss their implications for\nice shelf history and stability. All ages are reported in\ncalendar years Before Present (cal yr BP) at the 95%\nconfidence level (Table S1). All reported radiocarbon ages\nin this study were calibrated using the program OxCal v3.7,\nwhich uses the IntCal04 calibration curve [Reimer et al.,\n2004].\n4. Results\n[10] Our new age determinations significantly expand the\npreviously reported driftwood chronology from northern\nEllesmere Island [Stewart and England, 1983; Dyke et\nal., 1997]. Most of the radiocarbon dated samples reported\nhere were collected from sites landward of the Ward Hunt\nIce Shelf as well as from Clements Markham and Phillips\ninlets, two fiords occupied by multiyear landfast sea ice\n(Figure 1). Of the 69 driftwood dates, nineteen were\ncollected inland of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, including\nDisraeli Fiord (Figures 1 and S1). These samples range in\nage from 9200 to 5500 cal yr BP, after which the entry of\ndriftwood terminated (Figure 2 and Table S1). Further-\nmore, 12 samples fall between 7000 and 5500 cal yr BP,\nrecording an interval of widespread driftwood deposition.\nWest of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf, 14 samples from Phillips\nInlet show a similar age distribution, with the last entry of\ndriftwood about 5400 cal yr BP, while seven of the ages\nare younger than 7000 cal yr BP (Figure 2). Nineteen new\nradiocarbon ages obtained on driftwood collected within\nClements Markham Inlet bring its current total to 31, and\nshow nearly continuous driftwood deposition from 9900 to\n3500 cal yr BP (Figure 2). After 3500 cal yr BP driftwood\nis rare in Clements Markham Inlet. However, intervals of\nsea ice removal are recorded by three ages ranging from\n2800 to 1700 cal yr BP, and by two modern samples\n(Figure 2 and Table S1).\n[11] Prior to ice shelf formation, driftwood reached\nnorthern Ellesmere Island sporadically from the onset of\ndeglaciation until about 7000 cal yr BP, when its abundance\nincreased, consistent with a westward shift of the Transpolar\nDrift [Dyke et al., 1997]. From 5500 cal yr BP to present,\ndriftwood entry terminated landward of the Ward Hunt Ice\nShelf and within Phillips Inlet. This cessation contrasts with\ndriftwood deposition in Clements Markham Inlet until 3500\ncal yr BP and continuous deposition to present along\nnortheast Ellesmere Island [England, 1983; Stewart and\nEngland, 1983]. This indicates that the absence of driftwood\nyounger than 5500 cal yr BP behind Ward Hunt Ice Shelf\nand within Phillips Inlet is due to its preclusion by the\nFigure 2. Radiocarbon-dated driftwood samples from northern Ellesmere Island. Each date is plotted showing its\ncalibrated probability distribution (OxCal v3.7 [Reimer et al., 2004]). Termination of driftwood deposition in Phillips Inlet\nand behind the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf occurred abruptly at 5500 cal yr BP. Younger radiocarbon ages reported by Crary\n[1960] are designated with a question mark (see text). In Clements Markham Inlet a temporary cessation occurs\napproximately 3500 cal yr BP, after which driftwood re-enters intermittently to present.\nL19502 ENGLAND ET AL.: RECORD OF ARCTIC OCEAN SEA ICE L19502\n3 of 5\nestablishment of multi-year landfast sea ice and sea-ice ice\nshelves rather than a change in availability controlled by\natmospherically-driven ocean currents.\n5. Discussion\n[12] Previous efforts to date the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf\ninvolved radiocarbon dating of enclosed \u2018\u2018dirt layers\u2019\u2019 and\nmarine organisms, as well as driftwood collected on its\nlandward margin [Crary, 1960]. The dirt layers are allochth-\nonous (wind-transported from Ellesmere Island) thereby\nrendering uncertain the relationship between their organic\ncontent and the absolute age of the ice shelf. Furthermore, in\none case, a dirt layer was reported contaminated by soot\nfrom diesel fuel used to melt the ice (38 meltings produced\n1 g of carbon) [Crary, 1960]. Other dates obtained on\nmarine shells and sponges, entrained by basal accretion\nand collected from the bottom of the ice shelf, range from\n3400 to 13,200 14C yr BP [Lowdon and Blake, 1970; Lyons\nand Mielke, 1973]. Two driftwood samples collected land-\nward of the ice shelf dated 3400 and 3000 14C yr BP\n[Crary, 1960]. These driftwood dates are commonly cited to\nrecord the onset of ice shelf growth, and have calibrated\nages of 4100-3300, and 3700\u20132700 cal yr BP, respectively\n(Figure 2 and Table S1). If correct, they record a brief\nremoval of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf after 5500 cal yr BP.\nHowever, these ages are not given precedence here because\nthey were not duplicated in our expanded database and they\nare products of earlier radiocarbon dating by conventional\nbeta-counting that warrant confirmation.\n[13] Continued delivery of driftwood to Clements\nMarkham Inlet from 5500 to 3500 cal yr BP reflects more\nfrequent sea-ice clearance of this large fiord following\nestablishment of the ice shelves to the west (Figure 2).\nToday, a prominent, recurrent (annual) polynya expands\nnorthwestward from the north end of Nares Strait, progress-\ning across the Lincoln Sea towards the mouth of Clements\nMarkham Inlet [Kwok, 2006] (Figure 1). In the process of its\nnorthward expansion, Arctic Ocean sea ice is evacuated\nfrom the Lincoln Sea polynya southward into Nares Strait.\nThis evacuation removes sea ice as far west as the mouth of\nClements Markham Inlet, therefore increasing the likeli-\nhood of its seasonal clearance. Our dates indicate that after\n5500 cal yr BP, Clements Markham Inlet did not develop\nmultiyear landfast sea ice until 3500 cal yr BP. This lag of\n2000 years in the establishment of multiyear landfast sea ice\nmay record the influence of the Lincoln Sea polynya until\n3500 cal yr BP, after which driftwood entry is infrequent\n(Figure 2). The variability of driftwood deposition across\nnorthern Ellesmere Island underscores the potential signif-\nicance of local conditions affecting sea ice regime. After\n3500 cal yr BP, severe sea ice and ice shelves persisted\nacross northern Ellesmere Island until the 20th century.\n[14] If the northern Ellesmere Island ice shelves co-vary\nwith the extent of Arctic Ocean pack ice, as proposed for\nnorthern Alaska [Mahoney et al., 2007], then their signif-\nicant reduction between 1906 and \u00011950 should also reflect\na previously undocumented interval of Arctic Ocean sea ice\nreduction. This would have foreshadowed the modern\ndecline documented by satellite surveillance. Therefore,\nthe future stability of the remaining Ellesmere Island sea-\nice ice shelves also provides an important measure of the\nongoing integrity of Arctic Ocean sea ice. We note that the\ndetachment of the Ayles Ice Shelf (2005) was accompanied\nby an unusually large area of open water (15 km wide) vs.\nbuttressing pack ice [Copland et al., 2007]. The ongoing\ndemise of the Ellesmere ice shelves during the summer of\n2008 signals the unabated removal of the oldest sea ice in\nthe Northern Hemisphere.\n[15] Based on the new suite of driftwood ages, we\nconclude that the Ellesmere Ice Shelf and its historical\nremnants began to form shortly after 5500 cal yr BP.\nPaleotemperature records in cores retrieved from the Agas-\nsiz Ice Cap, northern Ellesmere Island also show a progres-\nsive decline in mean annual temperature since the mid\nHolocene [Fisher et al., 1995], with the worst sea ice\nconditions in the CAA coinciding with late 19th century\nexploration [Koerner, 1977]. Our model of ice shelf\ninitiation and stability could be readily tested by expand-\ning existing driftwood surveys to other parts of northern\nEllesmere Island that remain uninvestigated, (e.g., Ayles\nand Markham fiords). This should also include the former\neastern sector of the Ward Hunt Ice Shelf and fiords where\nthe chronology of glacial input to composite ice shelves\nremains undocumented.\n[16] We emphasize that stranded driftwood in the circum-\npolar region records a natural buoy system transported by\nsea-ice [Ha\u00a8ggblom, 1982] whose trajectory is controlled by\natmospherically-driven surface currents [Dyke et al., 1997;\nTremblay et al., 1997]. This driftwood record spans the\nlast ten thousand years, warranting integration with other\nglaciological and biological environmental proxies, as well\nas coupled ocean-atmosphere modelling [Tremblay et al.,\n1997]. However, we regard the lack of driftwood deposition\nlandward of existing ice shelves during the past 5500 years\nto record blockage by sea ice rather than unfavourable\natmospheric circulation because younger wood is present\nelsewhere on northern Ellesmere Island [Stewart and\nEngland, 1983].\n6. Conclusion\n[17] Radiocarbon dated driftwood deposited landward of\nthemodernWardHunt Ice Shelf and insidemultiyear landfast\nsea ice in Phillips Inlet, records its exclusion for more than\nfivemillennia. This contrastsmarkedlywith the historical and\nongoing breakup of the northern Ellesmere Island ice shelves\nsince the beginning of the 20th century. The removal of the\nremaining ice shelves and the opening of historically ice-\nfilled fiords nearby, should it occur, would be without\nprecedent in the last 5500 years. This underscores and\nclarifies the magnitude of ongoing Arctic Ocean sea ice\nreduction in response to 20th\/21st century warming.\n[18] Acknowledgments.
