Introduction\n[2] Signal strength measurements at 2 GHz have\nrecently been made on three over-sea paths in the British\nChannel Islands (see Table 1 and Figure 1 for transmitter\nand receiver locations). A summary of these measure-\nments are presented in the companion to this paper [Siddle\net al., 2007], together with a statistical analysis of the\nreceived signal strength variations and a comparison with\npredicted values made using current ITU-R Recommen-\ndations. The antenna heights were such that the ends of the\ntwo longest links were beyond the optical horizon, and for\nthe shortest link the ends were within the optical horizon\nfor most of the time. A large tidal range is prevalent in the\nChannel Islands (up to 10 m in Guernsey on a spring tide),\nand consequently the obscuration due to the bulge of the\nearth varies significantly within the tidal cycle.\n[3] In order to correlate the varying signal strengths\nwith different weather processes, meteorological data\nwere obtained from a number of sites around the Channel\nIslands (see Table 2). Hourly, sea-level meteorological\ndata were available from the Channel Light Vessel (CLV)\nanchored in the English Channel to the northwest of all\nthree radio paths. The distance of the CLV to the midpoint\nof the Jersey-Alderney link is approximately 70 km, and\nthe nominal height at which observations are made at this\nstation is 5.0 m above mean sea level. Higher altitude\nweather data were obtained from the airports on Jersey,\nAlderney and Guernsey with heights of 84.0, 88.7, and\n102.0 metres above mean sea level respectively. Data\nfrom the Maison St. Louis Observatory in St. Helier,\nJersey (54.0 m above mean sea level) and from a privately\nowned weather station in La Petit Val, Alderney (10.7 m\nabove mean sea level) were also employed.\n[4] This paper focuses on explaining the propagation\ncharacteristics during periods of normal reception and periods\nof enhanced signal strength (ESS)with particular emphasis on\nthe 48.5 km transhorizon Jersey to Alderney path (signal\nstrengths that exceed a threshold calculated assuming free\nspace loss along the path are classified as enhanced signals).\n2. Signal Strength Variations and the\nEstimated Evaporation Duct Height\n[5] The correlation between the computed Paulus-\nJeske (P-J) evaporation duct heights [Paulus, 1985]\nRADIO SCIENCE, VOL. 42, RS4020, doi:10.1029\/2006RS003617, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Department of Engineering, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.\n2Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University\nin Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0048-6604\/07\/2006RS003617$11.00\nRS4020 1 of 13\nand the corresponding hourly signal strengths measured\nat the Alderney high antenna is shown in Figure 2 (upper\nframe) together with the ESS threshold and diffraction\nthreshold (assuming mean antenna heights above sea\nlevel for the upper antennas) calculated assuming stan-\ndard atmospheric conditions. Hourly measurements of\nair temperature, sea temperature, relative humidity and\nwind speed made at the CLV were employed in calcu-\nlating the duct heights according to the P-J formulation.\nIdeally, the meteorological measurements would have\nbeen made close to the midpoint of the propagation\npaths, however such data were not available and the\nCLV was the closest available source. Since the CLV was\nsomewhat displaced from the paths of interest, horizontal\nhomogeneity was (by necessity) assumed.\n[6] To illustrate the effect of the tide, the data have\nbeen divided into four parts (Figure 2, lower frame):\ncases when the tide height (assumed to be the average of\nthe heights at Jersey and Alderney) between the trans-\nmitter and receiver is less than \u00012 m relative to its mean\nvalue, cases when the tide height lies between \u00012 m and\n0 m, cases when the tide height lies between 0 m and 2 m,\nand cases when the tide height between the transmitter\nand receiver exceeds 2 m. Best-fit lines for each tidal\nrange have been plotted in the lower frame of Figure 2.\n[7] In the upper frame of figure 2, the majority of the\ndata lie between the free space and diffraction threshold\nvalues indicating that the evaporation duct is able to\nincrease the received signal strength at Alderney well\nbeyond the diffraction level. However, the enhancement\nin signal strength provided by the evaporation duct is not\nsufficient to exceed the free space threshold. Addition-\nally, the distribution of data in the lower frame of Figure 2\ncorroborates the observation made in the companion\npaper [Siddle et al., 2007] that during periods of normal\nreception, stronger signals are received when tide heights\nare low and vice versa.\n[8] At most times during periods of non-ESS, the\nmeasured signal strengths increase with duct height, an\nobservation consistent with reports made by various\nauthors [SPAWAR, 2004; Hitney et al., 1985; Hitney\nand Veith, 1990]. Considering only the non-ESS data,\nthe signal strength at the Alderney high antenna\nincreases at the rate of 0.61 dB per metre increase in\nduct height. For the Guernsey and Sark high antennas,\nTable 1.

During stable\nperiods, when the air temperature exceeds the sea tem-\nperature, the P-J method incorporates a temperature\ncorrection (on the assumption that an error has been\nmade during measurement) that results in an under-\nestimation of the evaporation duct height [Paulus,\n1985]. Whilst it may be true that stable conditions are\nuncommon in the open ocean [Paulus, 1985; Babin et\nal., 1997], it is likely that these will occur more often\nin coastal regions that are particularly prone to land-\ninduced effects such as advection of warm air over a\ncooler sea surface. This is another reason for the depar-\nture from the general trend of higher duct heights\ncorresponding to higher signal strengths during periods\nof ESS (Figure 2, upper frame), as these occur primarily\nwhen stable atmospheric conditions are prevalent.\n3. Modeling Periods of Normal Reception\nWith the Parabolic Wave Equation Method\n[11] With the advent of powerful computers, the com-\nputationally intensive parabolic equation (PE) method\n[Dockery, 1988; Craig and Levy, 1991; Barrios, 1994;\nLevy, 2000] has become an efficient and practical tool for\ntropospheric radiowave propagation calculations (see, for\nexample, studies of the effects of tropospheric ducting\non the performance of UHF radio links presented by\nSlingsby [1991] and Sirkova and Mikhalev [2004]). In\nthis section, the propagation conditions during periods of\nnormal reception in the Channel Islands have been\nmodeled using the PE method. In particular, the split-\nstep parabolic wave equation [Dockery, 1988; Kuttler and\nDockery, 1991] that implements impedance-boundary\nconditions [Dockery and Kuttler, 1996] was utilised for\nfield strength calculations. Predictions for short periods\nof time (in summer and winter) were also made using\nthe radiowave propagation assessment tool, AREPS\n[SPAWAR, 2004] that makes use of a hybrid model\nincorporating the split-step PE method as a sub-model\n[SPAWAR, 2004]. The results for a few weeks of test\ncases indicate that the propagation loss values calculated\nwith the PE method and with AREPS are within 1\u20132 dB\nof each other.\n[12] Modified refractivity, M profiles based on the\nPaulus-Jeske method [Paulus, 1985] were generated for\neach hourly reading and utilised as inputs to the PE\nmodel. A typical modified refractivity-height profile (for\nFigure 2. Scatterplot of the Paulus-Jeske evaporation\nduct heights and the measured signal strengths at the\nAlderney high antenna (upper frame) and the corre-\nsponding plot showing the best-fit lines when the data is\ncharacterised according to four distinct tidal ranges\n(lower frame).\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n3 of 13\nRS4020\n07 December 2003 at 18:00 UT) illustrating the presence\nof an evaporation duct is shown in Figure 3. For this\nparticular case (air temperature: 7.8\u0001C, sea temperature:\n12.9\u0001C, dew point temperature: 2.6\u0001C and wind speed:\n14.3 m\/s), the evaporation duct height is 14.7 m while\nthe transmitter and receiver heights above sea level are\n13.8 m and 11.1 m respectively. For the purpose of\nillustration, shown in Figure 4 is the height vs. range ray-\ntrace plot for the evaporation duct profile and transmitter\nspecified above (produced in AREPS [SPAWAR, 2004]).\nTrapping of some of the direct and reflected rays\nbetween the earth\u2019s surface and the top of the evapora-\ntion duct at 14.7 m is evident and consequently propa-\ngation occurs for extended ranges within the trapping\nlayer. There is good agreement between the measured\nsignal strength of \u000186.6 dBm and the predicted signal\nstrength of \u000188.1 dBm.\n3.1. Illustrative Examples\n[13] During a distinctive cold weather period (04\u2013\n10 December 2003) when normal reception occurs, there\nis very good agreement between the measured and the\nPE-predicted signal strengths at the Alderney high\nantenna (Figure 5). This behaviour was also apparent\nfor the Guernsey and Sark measurements, and for both\nthe high and low antennas. In contrast, for a typical\nperiod of signal enhancement during late summer (12\u2013\n18 September 2003), there is little correlation between\nthe observations and the PE-predicted values (Figure 6).\nThe predicted signal strengths in this case simply indi-\ncate the regular oscillation in received power caused by\nthe tides.\n3.2. Analysis With Complete Signal Strength Data\nSet\n[14] A scatterplot of the measured signal strengths and\nthe PE-predicted signal strengths for all the valid hourly\ndata at the Alderney high antenna is shown in Figure 7\nFigure 3.

The overall correlation for these data is\npoor (correlation coefficient = 0.17) and the standard\ndeviation between the observations and predictions is\napproximately 12 dB. However there appears to be a\ndefinite correlation between the observed and predicted\nsignal strengths particularly for cases of normal recep-\ntion. A clearer depiction of this correlation can be seen in\nthe lower frame of Figure 7 in which all cases of\nenhanced signal strength have been removed. The cor-\nrelation coefficient for these data is 0.45, and the\nstandard deviation between the measured and predicted\nsignal strengths reduces to 7.4 dB.\n[15] Every tropospheric duct has a maximum wave-\nlength that it can support, depending upon the geometry\nand the change in refractivity across the duct. The\nmaximum cut-off wavelength, lmax, provides a general\nindication of the radio-wave trapping capability of a\nduct, and is given in equation (1) [Turton et al., 1988;\nBrooks et al., 1999].\nlmax \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\n3\nktdM\nr\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere t is the duct thickness (m), dM the modified\nrefractivity change across the duct (M-units), and k =\n3.77 \u0006 10\u00013 for a surface-based duct or 5.66 \u0006 10\u00013 for\nan elevated duct.\n[16] It is noteworthy that when only those cases of\nnonenhanced signal strengths are used in which\nthe corresponding evaporation duct cut-off wavelengths\nexceed 15 cm, the correlation coefficient between the\nPE-predicted and measured signal strengths at the Alderney\nupper antenna increases to 0.66.\n[17] Thus, even though the cut-off wavelength is\nsimply a rough indication of the trapping capability of\nan evaporation duct, it can still be used to show that\nwhen the likelihood of 2 GHz radio waves getting\ntrapped within a duct is maximized, the evaporation duct\ndoes becomes the dominant propagation phenomenon.\n(For a detailed discussion of the concept of maximum\ncut-off wavelength for evaporation ducts, the reader is\ndirected to the works of Hall [1979] and Turton et al.\n[1988].) Finally, it is also interesting to note that when\nthe Paulus-Jeske evaporation profiles are used in the\nFigure 6.

The cumulative frequen-\ncy distribution curves for three sets of data with reference\nto the Alderney high antenna are shown in Figure 8.\nThese data sets are (a) all measured signal strength,\n(b) only nonenhanced measured signal strength and\n(c) PE-predicted signal strength (using P-J evaporation\nduct profiles). The mean hourly signal strengths for the\ntwo years of data (for the same three signal strength data\nsets) are presented in Figure 9. In both figures, the\nchange in shape of the distributions for that of all\nmeasured data and for just nonenhanced signal strength\ndata is very significant. The PE-predicted signals provide\na much-improved estimate of the measured signal\nstrengths during periods of normal reception.\n[19] Given that only the effect of the evaporation duct\nhas been accounted for in these cases, this suggests that\n(a) the evaporation duct is responsible for propagation\nduring periods of normal reception (i.e. cold weather\nperiods) and (b) the evaporation duct refractivity profiles\nassumed within the PE predictions during periods of\nenhanced reception are insufficient to model the propa-\ngation, at least as it impacts on our paths\/antenna heights.\nThe latter conclusion points towards the existence of\npropagation mechanism(s) other than the evaporation\nduct which are responsible for the occurrence of\nenhanced signal strengths and that are not being taken\ninto account in the prediction scheme.\n4. Explanation of Enhancements Using\nMeteorological Data From Higher Levels in\nthe Troposphere\n4.1. Estimation of Refractivity Lapse Rate\n[20] Hourly weather data (air temperature, pressure and\nrelative humidity) from fixed weather sensors located at\nthe meteorological stations listed in Table 2 were closely\nanalysed in order to corroborate the existence of higher-\naltitude ducting\/super-refractive structures during periods\nof enhanced signal strength. The refractivity lapse rate,\ndN\/dh (in N-units\/km), in approximately the first 100 m\nof the troposphere was estimated for two years of data.\nThis was achieved by finding the slope of the best-fit line\nthrough points on the refractivity vs. height plot for\nhourly data from the various sites noted above. The mean\nrefractivity gradient was calculated to be approximately\n\u000171 N-units\/km, showing that on average the conditions\nin the lowest part of troposphere are very close to being\nsuper-refractive. It should be noted that a number of\nconclusions that are arrived at in this section are based\non estimations of the refractivity at different locations.\nIdeally, co-located refractivity measurements at different\naltitudes midway between the transmitter and receiver\npath are required.\nFigure 8. Cumulative frequency distribution curves for\nthree sets of signal strength data at Alderney (high\nantenna): (a) all measured signals, (b) only nonenhanced\nmeasured signals, and (c) PE-predicted signals (using P-J\nevaporation duct profiles).\nFigure 9. Graph depicting the hourly means for three\nsets of signal strength data at Alderney (high antenna):\n(a) all measured signals, (b) only nonenhanced measured\nsignals, and (c) PE-predicted signals (using P-J evapora-\ntion duct profiles).\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n6 of 13\nRS4020\n[21] Monthly curves of the mean value of dN\/dh\nbetween the earth\u2019s surface and a height of 1 km derived\nfrom historical radiosonde data are presented in ITU-R\nRecommendation P.453 [ITU-R, 2003]. For the region\naround the English Channel, this gradient varies between\n\u000140 and \u000150 N-units in the 1 km layer. The departure\nfrom these standard values of dN\/dh is to be expected\nsince we are dealing with the lowest 100 m of the\ntroposphere in a marine environment. Further statistics\nin ITU-R Recommendation P.453 indicate that the\nrefractivity gradient in the lowest 100 m above the\nsurface of the earth is less than \u0001100 N-units\/km for\nsmall percentages of time. Additionally, more recent\ndata extracted from ITU-R databases [ITU-R, 2003]\nindicates that the refractivity gradient exceeded for\n50% of the time in the lowest 65 m of the region is\nabout \u000155 N-units\/km.\n[22] Of 8340 valid Alderney high antenna signal\nstrength and dN\/dh data, 730 (8.8%) correspond to cases\nof enhanced signal strength. The occurrence statistics of\nthe four types of refractive conditions (ducting, super-\nrefraction, normal and sub-refraction) and the corresponding\npercentages of occurrence of enhanced signal strength at\nthe Alderney high antenna are listed in Table 3. The most\nimportant result that may be derived from this table is\nthat 664 out of 730 (91%) cases of signal strength\nenhancements occur during ducting or super-refractive\natmospheric conditions, thus underlining the significance\nof these nonstandard modes of propagation in the context\nof long-range UHF propagation. Also, despite the fact\nthat ducting or super-refraction occurs almost 40% of the\ntime, ESS events are recorded only 8.8% of the time.\nThis would suggest that although ducting and super-\nrefraction are primarily responsible for the occurrence of\nenhanced signal strengths on transhorizon over-sea\npaths, they do not necessarily always result in ESS\n(though the likelihood of ESS reception increases).\nNevertheless, these anomalous effects do allow radio\nsignals (enhanced or nonenhanced) to reach distant\nreceivers that under normal atmospheric conditions\nwould not propagate beyond the horizon.\n[23] As expected, there are very few cases of enhanced\nsignal strengths during periods of sub-refraction. Fur-\nthermore, as Figure 10 illustrates, practically all the\nducting events occur in the spring and summer months.\nThus, by simply utilising the long-term refractivity lapse\nrate as an indicator, we can get a reasonably clear\nverification of the different atmospheric conditions en-\ncountered in the lowest region of the troposphere during\nlong-range UHF propagation over the sea.\n4.2. Identification of Potential Higher-Altitude\nTrapping Layers in the Troposphere\n[24] During the spring and summer months, the sea\ntemperature at the CLV is lower than the air temperatures\nmeasured at all sites including the CLV, indicative of a\nstable atmosphere. This confirms that a stable atmo-\nsphere correlates well with the occurrence of enhanced\nsignals, and the extent of the stability is not just restricted\nTable 3.

In\ncontrast, during autumn and winter, the average sea\ntemperature well exceeds all the air temperature read-\nings, indicating a highly unstable atmosphere during\nthese periods.\n[25] In addition, there are also inversions in modified\nrefractivity taking place (that is, a decrease in M with\nheight instead of the normal increase in M). Inversions in\nmodified refractivity are an indication of potential duct-\ning layers [Hitney et al., 1985]. In particular, these\ninversions appear to occur between the heights of the\nAlderney and Guernsey airports during the spring and\nsummer months.\n[26] In order to identify the reasons for these\nM-inversions, the monthly occurrence frequency of tem-\nperature inversions between Alderney (88.7 m) and\nGuernsey (102.0 m) and the monthly average of the\nrelative humidity difference between these two heights\nare shown in the upper and lower frames, respectively of\nFigure 11. The former parameter has been quantified by\ndetermining the rate of incidence of the temperature at\nthe Guernsey Airport altitude exceeding the temperature\nat the Alderney Airport altitude by more than 1\u0001C. Under\nnormal circumstances, air temperature and water vapour\npressure in the troposphere decrease with altitude. How-\never, a temperature inversion and\/or rapid lapse rates in\nthe water vapour pressure between two layers of air can\nresult in the occurrence of very high refractivity lapse rates\n(i.e. dN\/dh\u0007\u0001157N-units\/km or dM\/dh\u0007 0M-units\/km).\nTogether, or in isolation, these two effects will result in the\noccurrence of tropospheric ducting layers.\n[27] A definite seasonal pattern is evident from both\nplots. The occurrence frequency of temperature inver-\nsions taking place between the heights of the Alderney\nand Guernsey airports increases substantially during\nsummer and spring (March to August) while reaching a\nminimum in the autumn and winter months (September\nto February). The difference in relative humidity also\nrises during the spring and summer months, indicating a\nfaster-than-normal RH lapse rate between the heights of\n88.7 m and 102.0 m. Thus, the plots verify that the two\nkey processes that result in ducting in the troposphere\n(manifested in M-inversions) are taking place.\n[28] The monthly occurrence frequency of strong\nM-inversions between the altitudes of the Alderney\nand Guernsey airports are presented in the lower\nframe of Figure 12; that is, the occurrence frequency\nof MGuernsey \u0001 MAlderney being less than \u00015 M-units.\nThis translates to an equivalent refractivity lapse rate of\napproximately \u0001533 N-units\/km, indicating extreme\nducting conditions. For comparison, the monthly occur-\nrence frequencies of ESS cases on the Jersey-Alderney\nradio path (both high and low antennas) are also shown\nin the upper frame of Figure 12. Clearly, both plots\nFigure 11. Monthly plots of the occurrence frequency of temperature inversions between the\nheights of the Guernsey (102.0 m) and Alderney (88.7 m) airports (upper frame) and the average\nrelative humidity difference between these two heights (lower frame) from August 2003 to August\n2005.\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n8 of 13\nRS4020\nfollow very similar seasonal patterns with the respective\noccurrence percentages reaching comparable values.\n[29] As mentioned previously, during the spring and\nsummer months there is a definite change in the physical\nproperties of the air at higher altitudes relative to that at\nthe surface. The CLV M (5.0 m above mean sea level) is\nnormally well below the value of M at the Jersey Airport\n(i.e. 84.0 m above mean sea level). Figure 13 shows the\nnumber of monthly occurrences of M-inversions between\nthe surface (i.e. the CLV) and the altitude of the Jersey\nAirport. Specifically, the graph illustrates the number of\ncases per month when the surface modified refractivity\nexceeds the modified refractivity at an altitude of 84.0 m.\nOver the two years of measurement, it is estimated that\nthere are 937 cases of such inversions in modified\nrefractivity, of which approximately 40% coincide with\nthe occurrence of enhanced signal strengths at Alderney.\nThe monthly variation in this figure is very similar to the\ntrend exhibited by the monthly ESS occurrence curve\npresented in the upper frame of Figure 12, peaking\npredominantly in the spring and summer months. Almost\n61% of these cases of M-inversions occur in the spring\nand summer periods. If we include September 2003 \u2013 a\nmonth in which a relatively large number of enhanced\nsignals were recorded \u2013 the latter figure increases to\n83%. A strong correlation therefore exists between the\noccurrence of ESS signals and very high lapse rates of\nrefractivity taking place aloft in the troposphere through-\nout the spring\/summer months.\n[30] Finally, the hourly occurrence frequency of\npotential trapping layers between the heights of the\nFigure 12. Monthly plots of the occurrence frequency of enhanced signal strengths at the\nAlderney high and low antennas (upper frame) and the corresponding occurrence frequency of\nmodified refractivity inversions between the heights of the Guernsey (102.0 m) and Alderney\n(88.7 m) airports (lower frame) from August 2003 to August 2005.\nFigure 13. The number of occurrences of M-inversions\nper month between the heights of the CLV (5.0 m) and\nthe Jersey Airport (84.0 m) (August 2003 to August\n2005).\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n9 of 13\nRS4020\nGuernsey and Alderney airports during periods of en-\nhanced signal strength is depicted in the lower frame of\nFigure 14. Once again, for comparison, the diurnal\nvariations in the occurrence of enhanced signals at the\nAlderney high and low antennas are shown in the upper\nframe (Figure 14). As with the signal strength, the hourly\noccurrence frequency of higher-altitude M-inversions\nfollows the same diurnal trend, with approximately\n40% of the inversions occurring between 1500 UT and\n2000 UT, and comparatively fewer existing in the\nmorning.\n[31] In the foregoing analysis, due to the lack of\nmeteorological data above an altitude of approximately\n100 m, the upper limit of these potential ducting layers\ncannot be specified. Nevertheless, the exceptionally high\nrefractivity lapse rates (resulting in M-inversions) caused\nby temperature inversions and rapid RH lapse rates\nbetween approximately 85.0 m and 100.0 m, provide\ndefinitive evidence of the existence of higher-altitude\nducting structures. These higher-altitude ducting layers\nare most likely resulting in the occurrence of enhanced\nsignal strengths on over-sea UHF paths, primarily during\nthe warm spring and summer periods.\n4.3. Modeling Periods of Enhanced Signal Strength\nWith the Parabolic Wave Equation Method\n[32] It has been shown earlier that during periods\nof normal reception, when the low-level evaporation\nduct profile was used as input to the parabolic wave\nequation model, an excellent correlation was achieved\nbetween the PE-predicted and measured signal strengths\n(Figure 5). During periods of enhanced signal strength\nhowever, the PE-predictions using the evaporation duct\nrefractivity profile were relatively inaccurate (Figure 6),\nproviding an indication that certain additional higher-\naltitude tropospheric phenomena are more dominant at\nthese times. The two preceding sections have focussed\non the identification and characterisation of these higher-\naltitude ducting\/super-refractive layers by utilising\nrefractivity data at different altitudes from nearby weather\nstations. In this section, an attempt has been made to\nmodel the propagation effects during periods of signal\nstrength enhancement, using the limited higher-altitude\nrefractivity data available to us.\n[33] Based on the results that have been presented so\nfar indicating the existence of higher-altitude ducting\nlayers in the troposphere, and in the absence of more\ndetailed meteorological data, refractivity measurements\nfrom the various weather stations (listed in Table 2) were\ncombined to provide an atmospheric profile for the first\n100 m to input to the parabolic equation model and\nAREPS [SPAWAR, 2004].\n[34] Figure 15 presents a comparative plot of the PE-\npredicted signal strength and the measured signal\nstrength at the Alderney high antenna for the same period\nof enhanced signal strength (12\u201318 September 2003)\nFigure 14. Graph illustrating the diurnal variation in the occurrence of enhanced signal strengths\nat the Alderney high and low antennas (upper frame) and the corresponding occurrence frequency\nof modified refractivity inversions between the heights of Guernsey (102.0 m) and Alderney\nairports (88.7 m) (lower frame).\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n10 of 13\nRS4020\nthat was presented in Figure 6. In the case of the higher-\naltitude refractivity data simulations (Figure 15), we\nobserve that there is a much better correlation between\nthe measured and predicted signal strengths. Thus, for\nperiods of enhanced signal strength, the correlation\nbetween measurements and predictions is better when a\nhigher-altitude refractivity profile is used than when the\nlow-altitude evaporation duct profile is used; whereas for\nperiods of normal propagation, the evaporation duct\nmodel provides a better correlation.\n[35] In conclusion it may be said that a seemingly basic\nscheme that involves the use of refractivity measure-\nments at different altitudes, from sea level up to approx-\nimately 100 m, has been applied to the PE-model and\nAREPS to produce a signal strength profile that agrees\nreasonably well with the experimental signal strength\nduring phases of enhanced reception. This result pro-\nvides confirmation of the existence of higher layer\nducting stratifications that become dominant (over the\nlow-lying evaporation duct) during periods of ESS\npropagation over the sea.\n4.4. Analysis of Upper-Air Radiosonde Data From\nNearby Stations\n[36] Historical as well as current data from nearby\nradiosonde stations were closely analysed to corroborate\nthe existence of higher-altitude super-refractive and\nducting structures in the English Channel region, partic-\nularly when signal strength enhancements are observed\nat Alderney, Guernsey and Sark.\n[37] Historical upper-air climatology (contained for\nexample in the AREPS database [SPAWAR, 2004]) from\nnearby radiosonde stations indicate that surface-based\nducts and elevated ducts occur reasonably frequently in\nthe region. Camborne (50.22\u0001N, 5.32\u0001W, altitude: 87 m\nabove mean sea level) and Brest\/Guipavas (48.45\u0001N,\n4.42\u0001W, altitude: 103 m above mean sea level) are two\nsuch coastal stations in the vicinity of the radio paths in\nthe Channel Islands. In particular, it was noted that\nsurface-based ducts occur more frequently in the months\nof May to September with less ducting taking place in\nthe autumn and winter months. This occurrence trend of\nsurface-based ducts in this region agrees well with the\nseasonal pattern of enhanced signal strength incidence\nalong the Channel Island radio links under consideration.\nFurthermore, it is also interesting to note that the average\nheight of the trapping layers producing the surface-based\nducts at Camborne are reasonably close to the approxi-\nmate height at which trapping layers (caused by temper-\nature inversions and rapid humidity lapse rates) were\nobserved in the upper-air data from various sources in the\nChannel Islands.\n[38] High-resolution radiosonde data from two nearby\nstations were closely analysed for two typical months of\nnormal reception (December 2003) and enhanced signal\nreception (May 2004). Since there are no radiosonde\nlaunch-sites located in the Channel Islands, the closest\nlocations from which high-resolution radiosonde data are\navailable to us are Herstmonceux (50.90\u0001N, 0.32\u0001W,\naltitude: 52 m above mean sea level) and Camborne\n(50.22\u0001N, 5.32\u0001W, altitude: 87 m above mean sea level),\nboth located very close to the southern coast of UK.\nMeasurements are recorded at 2-second intervals, twice a\nday (at 1100 UT and 2300 UT) and were obtained from\nthe British Atmospheric Data Centre.\n[39] The air temperature, pressure and relative humid-\nity (obtained from the air and dew point temperatures)\nradiosonde measurements from Herstmonceux and\nCamborne were utilised to produce corresponding values\nof modified refractivity, M. In order to be sure about the\nupper extent of these potential ducting structures, weather\ndata was analysed up to approximately twenty height\nreadings. Depending on the case being examined, this\nroughly corresponds to a maximum altitude of 230\u2013\n270 m for Herstmonceux and 260\u2013300 m for Camborne.\n[40] During December 2003 (when there are no cases\nof ESS), examination of the radiosonde data reveals that\npractically all the valid cases have monotonically in-\ncreasing values of M from the surface value. Very few\ninversions in modified refractivity are observed, and if at\nall, are limited to the first two readings (i.e. up to a\nmaximum of 60\u201375 m for Herstmonceux and 90\u2013100 m\nfor Camborne). There are practically no significant\ntemperature inversions taking place aloft.\nFigure 15. Comparison between the hourly measured\nsignal strength and the PE-predicted signal strength\n(using higher-altitude refractivity data) at the Alderney\nhigh antenna during a period of signal enhancement in\nsummer (12\u201318 September 2003).\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n11 of 13\nRS4020\n[41] Hourly ESSs occur at the Alderney high antenna\n42% of the time in May 2004. During this month,\ninspection of the modified refractivity height profiles\nreveals that there are many more inversions in M\ncompared to December 2003. Furthermore, most of\nthese inversions are accompanied by temperature inver-\nsions at the same altitude. Some of the times, a rapid\ndecrease in the relative humidity is also observed. This\nsuggests a correlation between the existence of higher-\naltitude trapping layers in the troposphere and the\noccurrence of ESS events along the over-sea radio links\nunder consideration.\n[42] It should be noted that despite providing reason-\nable evidence in support of the existence of higher-\naltitude trapping and super-refractive structures, the\nresults from the analysis of the high-resolution radio-\nsonde data and the historical upper-air climatology data\nshould be treated with caution: the data that have been\nstudied are from coastal stations that are located some\ndistance away from the over-sea radio paths being\ninvestigated; furthermore, since the data are available\nonly twice a day, tangible conclusions about the temporal\nscope of these higher-altitude structures cannot be made.\nNevertheless, in the absence of more accurate meteoro-\nlogical data, close examination of high-resolution radio-\nsonde data from nearby stations does provide some\nindication of the strong correlation between the occur-\nrence of enhanced signal strengths and the presence of\nupper-air super-refractive\/ducting structures. Further-\nmore, the higher-altitude trapping layers are observed\nreasonably concurrently at different locations around the\nEnglish Channel region, which strongly indicates (along\nwith the fact that ESSs are observed concurrently at\nAlderney, Guernsey and Sark) that these are a wide-\nspread phenomenon occurring over a large area.\n4.5. Analysis of Synoptic Charts\n[43] Areas of high pressure are often associated with\nanticyclonic weather [McIntosh and Thom, 1973;\nMcIlveen, 1986] that, in general, are characterised by\nsettled weather and light wind conditions, both of which\nhave been observed in the context of ESS occurrences in\nthe Channel Islands. Dry air from the upper troposphere\ndescends and is heated, sometimes producing an inver-\nsion of temperature. Furthermore, anticyclones usually\nextend over large regions and are slow-moving phenom-\nena. In order to further investigate this, synoptic charts of\nthe region (acquired from the UK Met Office) were\nclosely analysed to identify any distinctive meteorolog-\nical processes occurring during periods of sustained ESS\nevents.\n[44] Of the 119 days on which ESS occur, 50 cases of\nhigh-pressure centres were noted to be present directly\nover the English Channel region, and 41 of these 50 events\ncorrespond to days on which ESS cases occurred for four\nhours or longer. Additionally, it was observed that there\nare 41 days on which high-pressure centres exist over\nnearby regions in Europe and in the Atlantic. Thus, of all\nthe days on which ESS occurrences are recorded at\nAlderney, approximately 91 correspond to days (77%)\non which high-pressure cells are observed either directly\nover or close to the Channel Islands region. It is worth\nmentioning that the presence of high-pressure cells in the\nregion does not always result in the enhancement of\nsignals. In some cases, there is simply a marginal\nincrease in the received power (but not above the free\nspace threshold), while at other times, the anticyclonic\nweather does not seem to affect the signal at all.\n[45] It is evident that anticyclonic weather systems\n(occurring predominantly in the spring and summer\nmonths) are a major contributing factor to the occurrence\nof enhanced signal strengths on over-sea radio paths in\nthe English Channel. It is most likely that the process of\nsubsidence and accompanying advection associated with\nanticyclones is resulting in the creation of a layer of air at\nlow altitudes within which an inversion in temperature\nand a strong humidity gradient exists. Historical data\nshows that advection ducts frequently form over the\nEnglish Channel during the summer [Bean and Dutton,\n1966].\n5. Concluding Remarks\n[46] This paper describes a series of long-term UHF\npropagation measurements carried out over three com-\npletely over-sea paths in the English Channel ranging\nfrom 21.0 km to 48.5 km in length. The measurements\nand accompanying statistical analyses that have been\npresented both here and in the companion paper [Siddle\net al., 2007] provide a useful addition to the limited\nstatistics related to the low-altitude propagation of 2 GHz\nradio waves over long-range sea paths in temperate\nregions.\n[47] Evaporation ducting and diffraction appear to be\nthe dominant propagation mechanisms at most times.\nThe influence of the evaporation duct during periods of\nnormal propagation has been confirmed by modeling the\nover-sea propagation conditions using Paulus-Jeske\nevaporation duct refractivity profiles (generated using\nsea surface weather data) as input to the parabolic\nequation method.\n[48] Signal strength enhancements have been observed\non all three paths subject to investigation, primarily in\nthe late afternoon and evening periods, in the spring and\nsummer months. During periods of enhanced propaga-\ntion, which occur approximately 8% of the time on the\nlongest path (48.5 km), the presence of additional\nhigher-altitude ducting\/super-refractive structures has\nbeen verified and their influence has been modeled with\nreasonable success. These structures have been characte-\nRS4020 GUNASHEKAR ET AL.: PROPAGATION AT 2 GHz\u2014DISCUSSION\n12 of 13\nRS4020\nrised by identifying regions of inversions in the estimated\nmodified refractivity profiles and have been shown to be\ncaused by strong lapses of humidity and\/or temperature\ninversions aloft. The higher-altitude ducting\/super-\nrefractive structures follow similar diurnal and seasonal\ntrends as the occurrence of ESS. Finally, analysis of both\ncurrent and historical data from nearby radiosonde sta-\ntions also point towards the existence of higher-altitude\ntrapping structures at comparable altitudes in the region.\n[49] Acknowledgments.
