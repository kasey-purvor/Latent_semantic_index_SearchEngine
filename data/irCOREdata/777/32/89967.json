Methods and Results: Atrial myocytes were \nobtained from consenting patients in sinus rhythm, just prior to CS. Action potentials and ion currents were \nrecorded by whole-cell patch-clamp. Post-CS AF occurred in 53 of 212 patients (25%). Those with post-CS \nAF were older than those without (67\u00b12 vs 62\u00b11 years, P=0.005). In cells from patients with post-CS AF, the \naction potential duration at 50 and 90% repolarisation, maximum upstroke velocity and effective refractory \nperiod (ERP) were 13\u00b14 ms, 217\u00b116 ms, 185\u00b110 V\/s and 216\u00b114 ms, respectively (n=30 cells, 11 patients). \nPeak L-type Ca\n2+\n current, transient outward and inward rectifier K\n+\n currents, and the sustained outward \ncurrent, were -5.0\u00b10.5, 12.9\u00b12.4, -4.1\u00b10.4 and 9.7\u00b11.0 pA\/pF, respectively (13-62 cells, 7-19 patients). None \nof these values was significantly different in cells from patients without post-CS AF (P>0.05 for each, 60-\n279 cells, 29-86 patients), confirmed by multiple and logistic regression. In patients treated >7 days with a \u03b2-\nblocker pre-CS, the incidence of post-CS AF was lower than in non-\u03b2-blocked patients (13 vs 27%, \nP=0.038). Pre-CS \u03b2-blockade was associated with a prolonged pre-CS atrial cellular ERP (P=0.001), by a \nsimilar degree (~20%) in those with and without post-CS AF. Conclusion: Pre-CS human atrial cellular \nelectrophysiology does not predict post-CS AF. Chronic \u03b2-blocker therapy is associated with a reduced \nincidence of post-CS AF, unrelated to a pre-CS ERP-prolonging effect of this treatment. \n \n \nKeywords. \nAtrial fibrillation\/atrial arrhythmias; Cellular electrophysiology\/electropharmacology; Ion channels and \nmembrane transporters. \n \n 2 \nIntroduction. \nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients following cardiac surgery (CS). The incidence of post-CS AF \nranges from 15-42%,\n1\n with the arrhythmia usually occurring 2-3 days post-CS.\n1\n It is associated with an \nincreased incidence of stroke, poor haemodynamic performance, and increased morbidity and mortality.\n2\n The \nelectrophysiological mechanisms of post-CS AF are not known. \n The occurrence of post-CS AF is independently predicted by old age, post-CS withdrawal of beta-\nadrenoceptor antagonist (\u03b2-blocker) treatment, pre-CS AF, valve surgery, P-wave changes, and numerous \nother clinical factors.\n1,3,4\n Thus, in addition to surgical procedures and drug treatments, the pre-existing (pre-\nCS) characteristics of patients, and indeed their atria, influence the incidence of this arrhythmia. \n It is presently unclear whether pre-CS atrial cellular electrophysiology is predictive of post-CS AF. The \npre-CS inward rectifier K\n+\n currents, IK1 and IKACh, were similar in atrial cells from patients who did and did \nnot develop post-CS AF.\n5\n By contrast, the pre-CS L-type Ca\n2+\n current (ICaL) was larger,\n6\n and the transient \noutward (ITO) and ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K\n+\n (IKur) currents tended to be smaller,\n7\n in cells from those \nwith post-CS AF. In patients, the pre-CS atrial effective refractory period (ERP) was shorter in those who \ndeveloped post-CS AF,\n8\n suggesting that the action potential duration (APD) might also be shorter in such \npatients. However, an increase in ICaL, a decrease in ITO and IKur, or both would lengthen, rather than shorten \nthe APD. There are currently no reported studies of pre-CS action potentials or ERP in atrial cells from \npatients who develop post-CS AF.  \n Administration of \u03b2-blockers pre-CS reduces the incidence of post-CS AF.\n9,10\n Since sympathetic activity \nis high post-CS,\n11\n it is possible that \u03b2-blockers are anti-arrhythmic in this setting as a consequence of their \nblock of this enhanced sympathetic activity. However, we recently demonstrated that atrial myocytes from \npatients in pre-CS SR who had been given \u03b2-blockers, exhibited a prolonged APD and ERP that may be a \nconsequence of pharmacological remodelling.\n12\n It is unknown whether these pre-CS electrophysiological \nchanges confer protection against post-CS AF, but it has been shown that other drugs with Class III anti-\narrhythmic action reduce the incidence of post-CS AF.\n13\n It is conceivable that the degree of pre-CS ERP-\nlengthening produced by pre-CS \u03b2-blockade might be greater in the patients who remain in sinus rhythm \n(SR) post-CS than in those who develop AF. \n 3 \n The aims of this study, therefore, were two-fold. Firstly, to establish whether pre-CS human atrial cell \naction potential characteristics, ERP and ion currents differ between patients who do and do not develop \nnew-onset post-CS AF, including or excluding patients with co variables expected to influence post-CS AF \nincidence and\/or pre-CS electrophysiology. Secondly, to compare the degree of pre-CS APD- and ERP- \nprolongation associated with pre-CS \u03b2-blockade, between patients who do and who do not develop post-CS \nAF. \n \n \nMethods. \n Right atrial appendage tissue was obtained from 212 consenting patients in SR undergoing cardiac \nsurgery between 1999 and 2005. Procedures were approved by the institutional research ethics committee. \nAtrial cells were isolated using a method previously described in detail,\n14\n modified from that of Escande et \nal,\n15\n and often termed the \u201cchunk technique\u201d\n16\n since small chunks of tissue are superfused with enzyme. This \ntechnique, whilst having recognised limitations (potential disruption of ion currents, and relatively low yield \nand depolarisation of myocytes\n6,15-17\n) is necessary since atrial appendages cannot be arterially perfused. \nBriefly, tissue chunks were shaken for 45 min in a low [Ca\n2+\n] (50 \u00b5M) solution containing protease (4 U\/ml). \nProtease was then replaced by collagenase (400 U\/ml), which was renewed (exchanged) 3 times, at 15 min \nintervals. At each exchange, cells were separated by filtration and centrifugation, washed of residual enzyme \nin high [K\n+\n], low [Ca\n2+\n] solution, then placed in a 0.2 mM Ca\n2+\n-containing physiological salt solution. The \n2nd exchange (30 min collagenase exposure) typically produced the highest yield (5-20%) of Ca\n2+\n-tolerant \n(not exhibiting contracture with 0.2 mM Ca\n2+\n), quiescent, striated, rod-shaped cells.   \n Action potentials and ion currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, in either \nthe perforated or conventional ruptured patch configuration. Cells were superfused at 35-37 \no\nC, at 1.5-2 \nml\/min with a physiological salt solution containing (mM): NaCl (130), KCl (4), CaCl2 (2), MgCl2 (1), \nglucose (10) and HEPES (10); pH 7.4. Cd\n2+\n (0.2 mM) was included to block ICaL, when recording K\n+\n currents \nfrom some cells. Glass microelectrodes were pulled and heat polished to 1.5-8 M\u2126. With the perforated \npatch, action potentials were recorded using a K\n+\n-based pipette solution, containing (mM): nystatin (0.18), \nKCl (30.0), HEPES (5.0), MgCl2 (1.0), K methanesulfonic acid (100.0) and NaCl (5.0). ICaL was recorded \nusing a Cs\n+\n-based pipette solution (to eliminate outward K\n+\n currents) containing (mM): nystatin (0.18), CsCl \n 4 \n(30.0), HEPES (5.0), MgCl2 (1.0), Cs methanesulfonic acid (100.0) and NaCl (5.0). With ruptured patches, \naction potentials and ion currents were recorded with an aspartate-based pipette solution containing (mM): \nK-aspartate (110.0), KCl (20.0), MgCl2 (1.0), EGTA (0.15), Na2ATP (4.0), Na2GTP (0.4) and HEPES (5.0). \nThe maximum liquid junction potential was +7 mV (bath relative to pipette), and was compensated prior to \nseal formation. An Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) and \u201cWinWCP\u201d software (J Dempster, \nStrathclyde University) was used to stimulate and record electrical activity. Signals were low-pass filtered at \n5 kHz prior to digitisation (Digidata 1200, Axon). Capacitative transients were subtracted electronically from \nthe recordings. The voltage drop across the series resistance (Rs) was routinely compensated electronically, \nby 60-80%. Cell capacity and Rs were 76.7\u00b12.4 pF and 7.4\u00b10.4 M\u2126, respectively, in cells from patients with \npost-CS AF, and not significantly different from those in cells from patients without post-CS AF (78.8\u00b11.0 \npF and 8.2\u00b10.3 M\u2126; P=0.38 and 0.069, respectively). Action potentials were stimulated with 5 ms current \npulses of 1.2 x threshold, with an 8-pulse (S1) conditioning train at 75 beats\/min. The resting potential (Vm) \nwas -15\u00b12 and -16\u00b11 mV in cells from patients with and without post-CS AF, respectively (P=0.79), and a \nsmall holding current was used to clamp cells to a diastolic potential of -80 mV, as previously \ndescribed.\n12,14,17\n Action potential restitution was investigated with progressively premature test pulses (S2) \nfollowing the S1 trains, with S1 and S2 of equal magnitude. The cell\u2019s ERP was measured, as previously,\n12,14\n \nas the longest S1-S2 interval failing to elicit an S2 response of amplitude >80% of the preceding S1. The ICaL \nvoltage-dependent activation was measured from a holding potential (HP) of -40 mV, with 250 ms voltage \npulses (0.33 Hz), increasing from -30 to +60 mV in 10 mV steps. Peak ICaL density (at +10 mV) was not \nsignificantly different between the perforated- and ruptured-patch techniques (P=0.10), and perforated patch \nwas used in 64% of cells from patients both with and without post-CS AF. The ICaL response to the \nsympathomimetic isoproterenol (ISO, 0.05 \u00b5M; 90 s superfusion) was also measured in some cells. ITO and \nthe sustained outward current, ISUS were stimulated from an HP of -50 mV, with 100 ms pulses (0.33 Hz), \nincreasing from -40 mV to +60 mV in 10 mV steps. ISUS was measured as end-pulse current magnitude, and \nITO as peak outward minus end-pulse current. ISUS was considered to reflect mainly IKur,\n18\n but also includes \nvarious Ca\n2+\n-dependent and -independent currents.\n15,18,19\n The various components of ITO or ISUS were not \nseparated in the present study. IK1 was measured using linear voltage ramps increasing from -120 mV to +50 \nmV at 24 mV\/s, or with 500 ms voltage pulses (0.2 Hz) increasing from -120 mV to +50 mV, from an HP of \n-50 mV. All currents were normalised to cell capacity. \n 5 \n Details of each patient\u2019s clinical characteristics and drug treatments were obtained from the medical \nrecords, post-CS, and are shown in Table 1. Sinus rhythm was confirmed from a pre-CS 12 lead ECG. Each \npatient\u2019s cardiac rhythm, heart rate and drug treatments were assessed on the day of surgery, on the \npreceding day, and post-CS between 1 and 7 days. The early (0-3 day) period after CS was used to compare \ndata between patients with and without post-CS AF whenever sample size permitted, i.e. for all \nmeasurements except IK1, ISUS and the effect of ISO on ICaL, for which the 0-7 day period was used. Patients \nwere excluded from the analysis if they had a documented episode of AF at any time pre-CS, if they were \ntaking digoxin, or if their pre-CS \u03b2-blocker treatment had started later than 7 days before the day of surgery. \nPatient and associated cellular electrophysiological data were stored in a database (Access, Microsoft) for \nsubsequent analysis. \nStatistical methods. \nUnivariate measurements were compared between pairs of various subgroups of patients using 2-sided, 2-\nsample unpaired Student's t tests. Categorical data were compared using a \u03c7\n2\n test. All univariate \nelectrophysiological data are expressed as cell means\u00b11 standard error (SE) of the mean. All cell means and \nassociated P values (from the t-tests) were confirmed at subject level, by meaning all cell data obtained from \neach patient prior to meaning patients\u2019 data. Multiple linear regression\n20\n was used to further investigate \nassociations between patients\u2019 atrial electrophysiology and clinical characteristics or drug treatments. This \nprovided an estimate of the difference in each electrophysiological measurement between the levels of the \nfactor of interest, according to 10 variables considered to be of particular importance. Multiple logistic \nregression models were used to investigate the influence of both the clinical factors and the \nelectrophysiological covariates on the occurrence of post CS AF. All analyses were performed \nretrospectively, using SAS 9.1 for Windows software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The analyses \nincorporated all available information. Therefore, the tables and the statistical models are sometimes based \non different numbers of subjects, reflecting some missing data for some covariates. Only patients from whom \ncellular electrophysiological data were obtained were included in the study. No adjustment was made for \nmultiple comparisons. P<0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. \n \n 6 \nResults. \nPost-cardiac surgery atrial fibrillation was predicted by older patient age. \nPost-CS AF occurred in 53 (25%) of the 212 patients from whom atrial cellular electrophysiological \nrecordings were obtained. The incidence of post-CS AF remained constant throughout the study, eg: at 24% \nbetween 1999 and 2002, and 26% between 2003 and 2005. Significantly more patients developed AF within \nthe early (0-3 day) period after CS (36\/212: 17%) than within the following 4 day period (17\/212: 8%; \nP=0.005). The patients who had post-CS AF within 3 days were significantly older than those who remained \nin SR in that time (66.9\u00b11.7 vs 61.7\u00b10.8 years, P=0.005). Older age was confirmed as a significant predictor \nof post-CS AF, by multiple logistic regression (Table 2), with a 1.4-fold increased risk of developing post-\nCS AF for a 5 year increment in age (P=0.005). \nPre-CS atrial Ca\n2+\n current was not predictive of post-CS AF. \nFigure 1A shows representative examples of atrial ICaL from (upper panel) a patient who remained in SR \npost-CS and from (lower panel) a patient who developed early post-CS AF. The mean peak ICaL density (at \n+10 mV), recorded in 62 cells from 19 patients who developed post-CS AF was -5.0\u00b10.5 pA\/pF, virtually \nidentical to that in 279 cells from 86 patients who remained in post-CS SR, at -5.0\u00b10.2 pA\/pF; P=0.89 \n(Figure 1B). In a group of 19 patients who did not develop post-CS AF, age matched to the 19 patients who \ndid (age=69.2\u00b12.1 vs 69.7\u00b12.0 years), mean peak ICaL was -5.4\u00b10.5 pA\/pF, again, not significantly different \nfrom that in the group with post-CS AF, at -5.0\u00b10.5 pA\/pF, P=0.58). Of the total 105 patients in which atrial \ncell ICaL was measured, 50 either had the \u03b2-blocker treatment they received pre-CS withdrawn within 3 days \npost-CS, or were given a \u03b2-blocker for the first time within the same period. Exclusion of those patients from \nthe analysis again resulted in a similar mean peak ICaL in the patients who did and did not develop post-CS \nAF (-4.6\u00b10.6 vs -5.0\u00b10.3 pA\/pF, P=0.52). With multiple regression, taking into account co variables \nconsidered most likely to affect the incidence of post-CS AF (Table 3), peak ICaL was estimated to be similar \nin patients who did or did not develop post-CS AF (P=0.70). Logistic regression (Table 4), taking into \naccount all the patient and atrial cell electrophysiological characteristics (detailed in Tables 2 & 4, \nrespectively) confirmed that pre-CS atrial ICaL was not predictive of post-CS AF (odds ratio close to 1, \nP=0.83). In a subgroup of cells in which ICaL was stimulated with ISO, peak ICaL was -5.5\u00b10.4 and -14.6\u00b10.9 \npA\/pF in the absence and presence, respectively, of 0.05 \u00b5M ISO (n=79 cells, 34 patients; P<0.0001). This \nwas an increase of 9.1\u00b10.8 pA\/pF, or 207\u00b122% above control. The increase in ICaL by ISO was similar in \n 7 \ncells from patients with and without post-CS AF, at 7.7\u00b11.7 and 9.7\u00b10.8 pA\/pF, respectively (n=23 cells, 12 \npatients and 56 cells, 22 patients, respectively; P=0.25). The corresponding percentage increase in ICaL by \nISO also was similar between these patient groups (P=0.95, Figure 1C).  \nPre-CS atrial K\n+\n currents were not predictive of post-CS AF. \nFigure 2A shows representative atrial K\n+\n currents in myocytes from a patient who did not develop post-CS \nAF (upper panel) and from one who did (lower panel). The initial outward transient peak represents ITO and \nthe steady-state, end-pulse current, the sustained outward current (ISUS). Figure 2B (left panel) shows that the \nmean peak ITO (at +60 mV) was not significantly different between patients who did and did not develop \npost-CS AF (12.9\u00b12.4 vs 12.0\u00b10.6 pA\/pF, P=0.60). Figure 2B (right panel) shows that the mean peak ISUS (at \n+60 mV) also was not significantly different between these patient groups (9.7\u00b11.0 vs 10.6\u00b10.7 pA\/pF, \nP=0.49). Figure 3A shows quasi-steady-state current-voltage relationships, with the inward (negative) \nportion between approximately -95 and -120 mV indicative of the magnitude of IK1. The currents recorded in \na cell from a patient without post-CS AF (upper panel) were similar to those in a cell from a patient who \ndeveloped post-CS AF (lower panel). Figure 3B shows that mean IK1 density at -120 mV was not \nsignificantly different between patients who did and who did not develop post CS-AF (-4.1\u00b10.4 vs -4.0\u00b10.2 \npA\/pF, P=0.83). \nPre-CS atrial action potential characteristics and ERP were not predictive of post-CS AF. \nFigure 4A shows original representative action potentials and restitution characteristics in a single atrial cell \nfrom a patient who remained in SR post-CS (upper trace) and from one who developed post-CS AF (lower \ntrace). Action potential morphology, including maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax), amplitude, overshoot and \nAPD, and the cellular ERP, were all similar between these patient types, as confirmed by the mean data in \nFigure 4B. The holding current used was also similar in cells from patients with and without post-CS AF (-\n0.62\u00b10.09 and -0.71\u00b10.03 pA\/pF, respectively; P=0.28). The treatment of patients with a \u03b2-blocker for >7 \ndays pre-CS was associated with a significant prolongation in both action potential late repolarisation and \nERP: the APD90 and ERP were 193\u00b18 and 192\u00b18 ms, respectively, in the non-\u03b2-blocked patients (n=31) vs \n230\u00b17 and 234\u00b16 ms, respectively, in the \u03b2-blocked patients (n=58, P=0.001 for each). This prolongation \nwas independent of holding current (-0.74\u00b10.07 and -0.68\u00b10.03 pA\/pF in non-\u03b2-blocked and \u03b2-blocked \npatients, respectively; P=0.38), and was also confirmed by multiple regression analysis, with an estimated \nincrease in ERP by \u03b2-blockade of 36 ms (P=0.027). Action potential characteristics and ERP were therefore \n 8 \ncompared within sub-groups of patients, internally matched for age, who were treated and not-treated pre-CS \nwith a \u03b2-blocker, respectively. No significant differences were revealed between patients who did and who \ndid not develop post-CS AF in either sub-group. Furthermore, this outcome was unchanged by the exclusion \nfrom the analysis of patients either who had the \u03b2-blocker treatment they received pre-CS withdrawn within \n3 days post-CS, or were given a \u03b2-blocker for the first time within the same post-CS period. \n Three multiple regressions were fitted to further investigate associations between patients\u2019 clinical \ncharacteristics and action potential shape and ERP. Firstly, taking into account all co variables, ie: as for \nthose in Table 3. Secondly, taking into account only 4 co variables considered the most likely to influence \npost-CS AF. Thirdly, taking into account only age (shown in Table 2 to be predictive of post-CS AF) and \npre-CS \u03b2-blockade (shown above to prolong pre-CS APD and ERP). With each of these fits, the APD50, \nAPD90, action potential Vmax, amplitude, overshoot and ERP were estimated to be similar in patients who did \nand did not develop post-CS AF (P>0.05 for each). A logistic regression analysis, taking into account all the \npatient and atrial cell electrophysiological characteristics detailed in Tables 2 & 4, confirmed (Table 4) that \nnone of the pre-CS atrial action potential measurements and ERP were significantly predictive of post-CS \nAF (P>0.05 for each).  \nPre-CS \u03b2-blockade was associated with decreased incidence of post-CS AF, independently of ERP-\nlengthening.  \nFigure 5A shows that the incidence of AF which occurred within 3 days post-CS was significantly lower in \nthe patients who received a \u03b2-blocker pre-CS, than in the patients who did not receive a \u03b2-blocker pre-CS \n(13% vs 27%, P=0.038). In atrial cells from \u03b2-blocked patients, both the ICaL density (-5.1\u00b10.2 pA\/pF; n=242 \ncells, 71 patients) and its increase by 0.05 \u00b5M ISO (9.2\u00b10.9 pA\/pF; n=61 cells, 25 patients) were similar to \nthose in cells from non \u03b2-blocked patients (-4.7\u00b10.3 pA\/pF; n=99 cells, 34 patients, P=0.23, and 8.9\u00b11.7 \npA\/pF; n=18 cells, 9 patients, P=0.88), respectively. Pre-CS \u03b2-blockade was associated with a significant \nprolongation in the pre-CS atrial cellular ERP in the patients both who did and did not develop AF within the \n3 day post-CS period (Figure 5B). The degree of ERP-prolongation associated with pre-CS \u03b2-blockade, of \napproximately 20%, occurred similarly in each group, ie: irrespective of whether the patients went on to \ndevelop post-CS AF. \n \n 9 \nDiscussion. \nThis study is the first, to our knowledge, in which pre-CS human atrial action potentials have been compared \nbetween patients who do and do not develop post-CS AF. Earlier studies of changes in patients\u2019 pre-CS \nelectrocardiograms associated with post-CS AF showed prolongation of the P-wave duration (Pdur) and\/or P-\nR interval,\n8,21\n though a lack of prolongation and an increase in P-wave complexity also were found.\n4\n The \npresent study indicates that APD changes do not contribute to the prolongation of Pdur, which may be due to \naltered intra-atrial conduction velocity (\u03b8) or atrial size. Reduction in the action potential Vmax may cause \u03b8-\nslowing, but the present lack of a difference in Vmax suggests that any slowing of \u03b8 associated with post-CS \nAF occurs by other mechanisms, such as changes in expression of gap junction proteins.\n22\n A clinical study \ndemonstrated an association between post-CS AF and a shorter, spatially heterogeneous pre-CS ERP,\n8\n in \ncontrast to the present data which do not support pre-CS ERP-shortening as being predictive of post-CS AF. \nThe measurement of ERP in isolated cells has limitations compared to that made in-vivo, and does not \ninform about conduction or spatial heterogeneity.\n23\n However, the relevance of this measurement was \nsupported by the demonstration that pre-CS chronic AF was associated with its shortening,\n14\n and by a similar \nmagnitude to that in the right atrial appendage in patients in-vivo.\n24\n  \n The similarity in each of the atrial ion currents measured pre-CS, between groups of patients who did \nand who did not develop post-CS AF, is consistent with the lack of change in any action potential \nmeasurements or the ERP. Our data are also in agreement with a previous report of a lack of difference in \nhuman atrial IK1 between such patient groups.\n5\n There is one previous report that pre-CS atrial ICaL was \nsignificantly larger in patients who developed post-CS AF, than in those who did not.\n6\n The reasons for this \ndiscrepancy are unclear, though they may include differences in the clinical characteristics of the patients \nstudied. For example, those who developed post-CS AF in the earlier study\n6\n were of a similar age to those \nwho remained in SR. It was also noted\n6\n that there was a substantial overlap in the Ca\n2+\n current density data \nbetween the groups of patients with and without post-CS AF. It is worth noting that the present and other\n5-7\n \nanalyses of post-CS AF include only patients in pre-CS SR. Pre-CS AF, however, is well established to be \naccompanied by atrial electrophysiological changes, including decreased ICaL,\n6,14\n ITO\n7,14\n and ERP,\n14\n and \nincreased IK1.\n5,14\n Nevertheless, such changes and, therefore, any potentially associated predisposition to AF, \nwere not found pre-CS in patients in SR who develop post-CS AF. \n 10 \n Long term treatment of patients pre-CS with a \u03b2-blocker was associated retrospectively with a \nsignificant reduction in the incidence of post-CS AF, in line with previous prospective studies.\n9,10\n Pre-CS \nchronic \u03b2-blockade also was associated with a significant prolongation in the pre-CS atrial cell APD and \nERP, consistent with an earlier report from our laboratory.\n12\n Those electrophysiological changes, recorded in \nthe presumed absence of residual \u03b2-blocker (since cells had been isolated and washed), and independent of \nheart rate, reflect an adaptive response, which has been termed pharmacological remodelling.\n12\n This is \ndistinct from reversal of AF-induced remodelling,\n25\n since it occurred in cells from patients in SR. Such \u03b2-\nblocker-induced ERP-prolongation, by lengthening the minimum path length required for atrial re-entry, \nmight contribute to the anti-fibrillatory actions of \u03b2-blockers.\n26\n In the present findings, the degree of atrial \nERP-prolongation associated with pre-CS chronic \u03b2-blockade was virtually identical in the patients who did \nand did not develop post-CS AF. This suggests that the atrial anti-fibrillatory effects of pre-CS \u03b2-blockade \nwere not due to enhanced pharmacological remodelling in the patients who remained in post-CS SR. \nHowever, action potential and ion current properties measured pre-CS may not reflect those present in \npatients in AF post-CS, and an enhanced post-CS ERP-prolongation in the \u03b2-blocked patients who \nmaintained SR cannot be excluded. Furthermore, it is conceivable that any such anti-reentrant influence \ncould nevertheless be overcome by a focal arrhythmic mechanism. The present experiments with ISO \nsuggest that such a focal mechanism would not involve any enhancement of the pre-CS ICaL response to \ncatecholamines.  \n The causes and predictors of post-CS AF are complex and multifactorial. The arrhythmia is re-entrant, \nwith a variety of electrophysiological onset mechanisms, but with the final trigger in the majority of cases \nbeing a conducted atrial extrasystole.\n3\n Post-CS AF seems to be caused mainly by the surgical procedure \nitself, sensitised by the pre-existing influence of age on atrial electrophysiology, and modified by pre- and \npost-CS drug treatments. The surgical causes are considered to be the effects of circulating catecholamines, \nimbalances in autonomic tone (including parasympathetic resurgence), transient electrolyte imbalance, \nmyocardial ischaemia, inflammation and mechanical irritation.\n27-31\n Older age may pre-dispose the atrium to \nre-entry by slowing \u03b8\n32\n as a result of atrial atrophy, dilation and\/or fibrosis,\n33\n rather than by slowing atrial \ncell action potential Vmax. Atrial structure was not examined in the present study, and pre-CS structural \nchanges have been associated with the development of new onset post-CS AF, including atrial enlargement,\n34\n \n 11 \nincreased fibrosis,\n33\n and up regulation of type I collagen\n35\n and connexin40.\n22\n Persistent AF is accompanied \nby atrial structural changes which may contribute to the perpetuation of the arrhythmia independently of ERP \nchanges. The precise nature of these structural changes, termed the \u201csecond factor\u201d of AF\n36\n remains unclear, \nbut similar changes pre-CS could conceivably promote new onset post-CS AF. \n The present data indicate that the occurrence of post-CS AF is not predicted by pre-CS atrial cellular \nelectrophysiology. Furthermore, since pre-CS \u03b2-blockade reduced the incidence of this arrhythmia without \nan involvement of \u03b2-blocker effects on the pre-CS ERP, mechanisms independent of pre-CS ERP change, \nsuch as attenuation of triggered atrial extrasystoles, are likely to underlie the post-CS atrial anti-arrhythmic \neffects of \u03b2-blockers. \n \n \nAcknowledgements. \nWe acknowledge the British Heart Foundation for financial support, and Glasgow Royal Infirmary cardiac \nsurgical operating teams for kindly providing atrial tissue. \n \n \nReferences \n 1.
