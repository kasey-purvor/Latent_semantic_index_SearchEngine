As technologies to design and manufacture\ndiagnostic tests have developed, a range of self-tests have become available to the public to buy\nover-the-counter and via the Internet. This study aims to describe how many people have used self-\ntests and identify factors associated with their use.\nMethods: A postal questionnaire will elicit basic information, including sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, and whether the person has used or would use specified self-tests. Consent will be\nsought to recontact people who want to participate further in the study, and interviews and focus\ngroups will be used to develop hypotheses about factors associated with self-test use. These\nhypotheses will be tested in a case-control study. An in-depth questionnaire will be developed\nincorporating the identified factors. This will be sent to: people who have used a self-test (cases);\npeople who have not used a self-test but would use one in the future (controls); and people who\nhave not used and would not use a self-test (controls). Logistic regression analysis will be used to\nestablish which factors are associated with self-test use.\nDiscussion: Self-tests do have potential benefits, for example privacy and convenience, but also\npotential harms, for example delay seeking treatment after a true negative result when the\nsymptoms are actually due to another condition. It is anticipated that the outcomes from this study\nwill include recommendations about how to improve the appropriate use of self-tests and existing\nhealth services, as well as information to prepare health professionals for patients who have used\nself-tests.\nBackground\nMembers of the public have become more involved in\ntheir own care. They use pregnancy tests and tests to mon-\nitor diagnosed conditions, such as diabetes mellitus [1],\nand self blood pressure measurement is popular [2]. Initi-\natives such as NHS Direct and the need to control costs\nhave contributed to the development of self-care [3,4], as\nhighlighted by the increasing scope for self-medication\n[5]. While this has been happening, technologies to\ndesign and manufacture tests that can be used in the home\nhave advanced. As a result, a wider range of diagnostic and\nscreening tests have become available to the general pub-\nlic [6]. These include tests for chlamydia, prostate specific\nantigen and faecal occult blood. Results are available\nimmediately or after sending a sample to a laboratory, but\ncontact with a doctor, nurse or other health professional\nPublished: 25 July 2006\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:193 doi:10.1186\/1471-2458-6-193\nReceived: 05 July 2006\nAccepted: 25 July 2006\nThis article is available from: http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/193\n\u00a9 2006 Ryan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0), \nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Page 1 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:193 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/193is not necessary. These \"self-tests\" are likely to become\neven more easily available and widely used as the Internet\ncontinues to reduce physical and intellectual barriers.\nPeople may use self-tests because of benefits of being\ntested outside a conventional medical setting. For exam-\nple, people who would not visit a health professional may\nscreen themselves because it is more convenient and pri-\nvate [7]. There are, however, also potential harms from\nbeing tested in this way. For example, a person who\nreceives results without an interpretation of the whole pic-\nture, including signs and symptoms, could think he\/she\nhas a disease inappropriately, or a person could delay\nseeking treatment after a true negative result when his\/her\nsymptoms are actually due to another condition. There\nwill also be false positive and false negative results. Self-\ntests are used without a formal independent assessment of\nthese harms and benefits. Even if members of the public\nuse tests that have been assessed as being beneficial when\nused during conventional screening programmes, their\nuse is outside those quality assured programmes. Possible\ndoubts associated with such testing include test accuracy,\nthat people who are most at risk may not use self-tests,\nand that people with positive results may not actually get\ntreated [8].\nMany general practitioners feel that their workload has\ngrown due to the move towards a primary-care-led NHS,\nthat their prescribing behaviour is affected by patient\ndemand, and that the number of demanding patients has\nrisen [9-11]. An expansion of the use of self-tests may also\nexacerbate this perceived increase in demand and work-\nload as people seek an explanation of results or further\ninvestigation.\nDespite the potential impact of self-tests, the extent of\ntheir use is not known. Other than market research, a\ncomprehensive literature review identified only one\nrecent survey in the United Kingdom that asked partici-\npants about whether they had used home testing kits, and\nthis was part of a study on attitudes to genetic testing [12].\nThere is also an absence of studies about why people use\nself-tests and perceived and actual harms and benefits.\nPilot work\nDuring September and October 2004, we sent question-\nnaires and prepaid envelopes to 380 addresses randomly\nselected from the Birmingham South West 2004\/05 resi-\ndential telephone directory. The questionnaire asked\nwhether the respondent had used or would use specified\nself-tests, with room to add any not listed. We wanted to\nmaximise responses from men and women because some\nself-tests, for example for prostate disorders, would only\nbe used by one sex. We, therefore, sent two questionnaires\nto each address with a request for the addressee to give the\nadditional questionnaire to any other adult living at the\nsame address. The questionnaire asked whether the\nrespondent lived alone to allow us to estimate the denom-\ninator.\nThree questionnaires were returned because the addressee\nhad died or moved, and 184 completed questionnaires\nwere received from the remaining 377 households. The\ndenominator for the response rate (n = 697) was esti-\nmated as the 57 respondents who reported that they lived\nalone plus two adults at each of the remaining 320\naddresses, and the response rate was 26%. Excluding 22\npeople who had only used a pregnancy test, 28 (15%)\nrespondents said they had used a self-test. Respondents\nmost commonly reported using a test for diabetes (n =\n18), but they also reported using tests for cholesterol,\ninfertility, urinary infection, haematuria, prostate specific\nantigen and HIV-infection. Sixty two percent (n = 96) of\nthe 154 respondents who had not used a self-test other\nthan a pregnancy test said they would use one in the\nfuture.\nStudy aims\nThe primary aims of this study are to describe the preva-\nlence of the use of self-tests by members of the public to\ndiagnose or screen for conditions without the involve-\nment of a doctor, nurse or other health professional, and\nto determine factors that are associated with their use.\nMethods\nStudy design\nMixed methods two-stage study with (1) an initial survey\ncomprising a postal questionnaire, interviews and focus\ngroups, followed by (2) an embedded case-control study.\nSelection criteria\nAdults aged 18 years or older randomly selected from par-\nticipating general practices will be asked to complete the\ninitial questionnaire. Practices will be selected to reflect\nthe diversity of the population based on deprivation indi-\ncators, population density and ethnicity.\nExclusion criteria\nThe initial questionnaire will not be sent to people who\nthe general practitioner feels that it would be inappropri-\nate to approach, for example people with a severe mental\nillness, terminal illness or recent bereavement.\nMethods of data collection\nThe initial survey involves a postal questionnaire that will\nelicit basic information about sociodemographic charac-\nteristics (e.g. age, sex, ethnic group, employment status),\nhealth status, and whether the person has used or would\nuse self-tests that have been identified as available from a\nsearch of the Internet. The questionnaire will be designedPage 2 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:193 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/193using lessons learnt from the pilot survey and will be\npiloted with a small sample of the target population\nbefore being widely distributed. A cover letter will outline\nthe study in lay terms and ask people to complete the\nquestionnaire and return it in the enclosed prepaid enve-\nlope. The letter will be on headed notepaper from the per-\nson's general practice and signed by a partner at the\npractice. People will be given the option of returning a\nblank questionnaire to indicate that they do not want to\ntake part. One reminder will be sent to non-responders.\nThis first questionnaire will seek consent for recontacting\npeople about further participation in the study.\nInterviews are suitable for gaining an in-depth under-\nstanding of personal experience and perspectives [13],\nand we will use interviews to investigate factors that may\nhave influenced whether people used self-tests. Focus\ngroups can be used to pilot ideas and questions [14,15],\nand we will conduct focus groups with people who have\nnot used self-tests to reflect on the general applicability of\nfactors identified in the interviews. People who consented\nto be recontacted about talking with a researcher will be\nsent an information leaflet and a reply slip to indicate if\nthey would like to take part in an interview or focus group\nwith a prepaid envelope to return the slip. To put people\nat ease and increase the likelihood of interaction, focus\ngroups will include people of the same sex and similar\nages. A semi-structured topic guide will be used for the\ninterviews, and the topic guide for the focus groups will be\nbased on factors identified during the interviews.\nResults from the postal questionnaire, interviews and\nfocus groups will be used to develop hypotheses about\nfactors that may influence use of self-tests other than preg-\nnancy tests: pregnancy tests will be excluded as women\nhave used them for some time and their use is probably\nnow expected by doctors. These hypotheses will then be\ntested in a case-control study. An in-depth questionnaire\nwill be developed incorporating the factors of interest. The\nquestionnaire will be piloted with a small number of peo-\nple from the target groups before it is sent to: cases who\nhave used a self-test; controls who have not used a self-test\nbut would use one in the future; and controls who have\nnot used a self-test and would not use one in the future.\nThis staging of questionnaires has been successfully used\nin other studies and is believed to generate a better\nresponse rate then sending a longer initial questionnaire\n[16]. A cover letter will outline the study in lay terms and\nask people to consider completing the questionnaire and\nreturning it using the enclosed prepaid envelope. People\nwill be given the option of returning a blank question-\nnaire to indicate that they do not want to take part. One\nreminder will be sent to people who do not return a ques-\ntionnaire.\nJustification of sample size\nAs pregnancy tests will be excluded, self-test in this and\nthe next section refers to tests other than pregnancy tests.\nConservatively assuming that 10% of people have used a\nself-test, a sample of 4200 people will allow estimation of\nthe prevalence of the use of self-tests with at least +\/-1%\nprecision and 95% confidence. Based on a response rate\nof 40%, which is less than other large prevalence surveys\n[16], the questionnaire will be sent to 10500 people.\nAssuming an average list size of 4500 people, 75% of\nwhom are 18 years or older [17], and 5% of whom meet\nthe exclusion criteria, it would be sufficient to recruit four\ngeneral practices, but up to eight will be recruited to reflect\ndiversity and increase generalisability.\nIt is assumed that 75% (n = 315) of the 420 respondents\nwho have used a self-test and 50% (n = 1890) of the 3780\nrespondents who have not used a self-test will agree to be\nrecontacted. Purposive sampling will be used to select\npeople for interviews and focus groups [18]. For the inter-\nviews, we will select men and women of different ages\n(younger and older) who have used self-tests for different\nconditions (cancers, other chronic conditions, sexually\ntransmitted infections, other acute infections or condi-\ntions). The ideal size for a focus group is between four and\neight people [15], and we anticipate that each group will\ninclude six people who have not used self-tests. To facili-\ntate sharing of views [14], we will hold groups with people\nof the same sex and similar ages. To allow loose matching\nby age (younger or older) and sex (male or female), up to\nfour groups will be held. We anticipate, therefore, that\ninterviews and focus groups will involve up to about 24\nself-test users and 24 non-users [19].\nAssuming that 75% of people who have used a self-test\nand 50% of people who have not used a self-test respond\nto the invitation to take part in an interview or focus\ngroup, we will need to approach 32 people who have used\na self-test and 48 people who have not used a self-test to\ntake part in this part of the study. This will leave 283 self-\ntest users and 1842 non-users who have agreed to be\nrecontacted.\nIn the absence of data relating to self-testing, we used fac-\ntors associated with self-care to calculate a likely sample\nsize for the case-control study. A Spanish study found that\nself-medication was more prevalent among people who\nlived alone [20]. About 15% of adults aged 16 years or\nover live alone [21,22]. If the same proportion of people\nwho have not used a self-test live alone, data from 207\ncases and 207 controls should detect a doubling of the\nodds of living alone among people who have used a self-\ntest with 80% power and 5% significance.Page 3 of 5\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2006, 6:193 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/6\/193Assuming that 75% of the remaining 283 self-test users\nreturn the in-depth questionnaire, there will be data from\n212 cases. The pilot survey suggests that 62% (n = 1148)\nof the remaining 1842 non-users would consider using a\nself-test in the future, whereas 38% (n = 694) would have\nno interest in using one. Assuming a response rate of 50%,\nthe in-depth questionnaire will need to be sent to 424\npeople from each of these groups to generate 212 controls\nfrom each group.\nMethods of data analysis\nThe prevalence of the use of self-tests will be estimated\nafter appropriate standardisation to the national popula-\ntion, and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. We\nwill compare sociodemographic characteristics of people\nwho have used, who have not used, who would use, and\nwho would not use self-tests.\nInterviews and focus groups will be recorded and fully\ntranscribed. The transcripts will be read, coded, indexed\nand categorised, facilitated by appropriate software. We\nwill use grounded theory, that is we will identify analytical\ncategories as they emerge from the data and use these cat-\negories to develop hypotheses about factors that may be\nassociated with using self-tests [23]. The analysis will be\niterative: hypotheses will be tested as they emerge using\nanalytic induction [23], and we will amend the antici-\npated number of interviews and focus groups depending\nupon whether new issues continue to emerge. Respondent\nvalidation will be sought by inviting feedback from partic-\nipants who will be sent a written summary of the inter-\nview or focus group.\nThe data from the second in-depth questionnaire will be\nfully investigated and described using univariate and\nbivariate comparisons of people who have and who have\nnot used a self-test. Stepwise logistic regression will then\nbe used to test the hypotheses developed during the inter-\nviews and focus groups and examined by the second ques-\ntionnaire, and to establish those factors that are associated\nwith using a self-test.\nSelf-tests can be grouped according to the disease area, for\nexample for cancer or sexually transmitted infections. Sec-\nondary analyses will be conducted to generate hypotheses\nabout whether particular determinants of self-test use vary\nby the type of test and, therefore, whether future research\nshould be test-specific.\nBias and confounding\nWe aim to maximise compliance and minimise selection\nbias by keeping the demands on people to a minimum,\nbut we will compare the characteristics of responders and\nnon-responders and standardise the results to the\nnational population. People who have participated in\ninterviews or focus groups will be excluded from the case-\ncontrol study as their responses could be affected by the\ndiscussion. During the case-control study, it is anticipated\nthat cases and controls will be matched by sex and age\ngroup because they may be confounders: possible deter-\nminants of self-test use, such as access to the Internet, may\nvary with age. The criteria for matching will, however, be\nfinalised after further information is collected during the\ninterviews and focus groups. As the first questionnaire\nmay \"educate\" people and lead to self-test use, the second\nquestionnaire will be analysed on the basis of reported\nself-test use when the first questionnaire was distributed.\nTo minimise recall bias, respondents to the second ques-\ntionnaire will be asked to report behaviours and experi-\nences over the preceding year.\nEthical approval\nThis study has been approved by Solihull Local Research\nEthics Committee, reference 05\/Q2706\/13.\nDiscussion\nThe pilot study suggests that some people are using self-\ntests. These findings are in line with a 1993 survey in\nwhich 18% of respondents said they would prefer self-\ntesting to testing by a doctor [24]. A recent British Medical\nAssociation report highlighted, however, that ad hoc\nscreening can put people at risk because of a lack of evi-\ndence underpinning tests and insufficient quality assur-\nance and accompanying information [25]. Self-tests do\nhave potential benefits, for example privacy and conven-\nience, but also potential harms, for example distress\ncaused by false positive results [26]. Other potential prob-\nlems include extra pressure on primary health care profes-\nsionals and NHS laboratories as people seek an\nexplanation of results or further investigation [27].\nDespite this, there is an absence of studies about self-tests.\nWe think that important first steps are to describe the\nprevalence of the use of self-tests and to determine factors\nthat are associated with using them.\nAbbreviations\nNHS = National Health Service.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAngela Ryan, Sue Wilson and Sheila Greenfield designed\nthe pilot questionnaire survey, and Angela Ryan con-\nducted the survey and analysed the data.
