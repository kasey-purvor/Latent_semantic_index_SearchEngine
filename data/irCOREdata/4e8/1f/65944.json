Res., 112,\nF03S15, doi:10.1029\/2006JF000562.\n1. Introduction\n[2] Numerous studies in the western United States, based\non relative and absolute age constraints, have shown that\nlong-term spatial variations in fan deposition are recorded\nby the presence of multiple depositional lobes, each of\nwhich was presumably active at a different time [e.g.,\nDenny, 1965; Hunt and Mabey, 1966; Hooke, 1967; Wells\net al., 1987; Blair and McPherson, 1994; Bierman et al.,\n1995; Ritter et al., 1995, 2000; Reheis et al., 1996; Harvey\net al., 1999; Zehfuss et al., 2001]. The preservation of fan\nlobes is often limited by the inherent transience of fan\nsurfaces because of both aggradation and burial of older\ndeposits and to abandonment of active fan depositional\nlobes. This transience depends upon a variety of factors,\nboth external (precipitation, catchment rock uplift, and basin\nsubsidence) and internal (sediment production and mobili-\nzation, catchment sediment storage, and fan head incision).\n[3] The presence of fan head incision, which is a widely\nobserved phenomenon on arid region fans in the western\nUnited States [e.g., Eckis, 1928; Bull, 1964a; Hooke, 1967;\nBull, 1977; Harvey, 1984], is particularly important for the\npreservation of multiple depositional lobes. While an in-\ncised fan head leads to abandonment of a former active fan\nlobe and a basinward shift of the depocenter, the absence of\nfan head incision causes proximal distribution of sediment\nand a resurfacing of the entire fan surface. Thus incision\nwould cause the preservation of multiple depositional lobes,\nwhereas a lack of fan head incision would result in a single\ndepositional fan surface. The timescales over which lobes\nare active and abandoned, and the timing of fan head\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 112, F03S15, doi:10.1029\/2006JF000562, 2007\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Institute of Geology, Eidgeno\u00a8ssische Technische Hochschule Zu\u00a8rich,\nZurich, Switzerland.\n2Now at Department of Geography, Durham University, Durham, UK.\n3Institute of Particle Physics, Eidgeno\u00a8ssische Technische Hochschule\nZu\u00a8rich, Zurich, Switzerland.\n4Department of Geography, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\n5Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College\nLondon, London, UK.\n6Paul-Scherrer Institute, Zurich, Switzerland.\nCopyright 2007 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/07\/2006JF000562$09.00\nF03S15 1 of 11\nincision itself, remain contentious and poorly understood,\nleading to competing models of fan development in the face\nof climatic and tectonic variations [e.g., Lustig, 1965; Bull,\n1964b, 1991; Hooke, 1972; Fraser and DeCelles, 1992;\nHooke and Dorn, 1992; Whipple and Trayler, 1996; Allen\nand Densmore, 2000; Densmore et al., 2007]. Exposure\ndating of fan lobes with cosmogenic 10Be now allows us to\nplace absolute constraints on these timescales, enabling us\nto evaluate potential controls on fan incision mechanisms.\nIn addition, given that deposition on fans is likely dependent\non climate-modulated variations in sediment production and\nsupply, absolute ages from exposure dating allow us to\nunderstand the resolution of fan surfaces as proxies for such\nexternal environmental variables [e.g., Nichols and Fisher,\n2007].\n[4] Debris flow fans on the western side of Owens Valley\nrecord sediment supply from catchments in the eastern Sierra\nNevada, California, and show significant differences in their\ndepths of fan head incision. Available absolute ages on fan\ndeposition in the eastern Sierra come largely from fans with\nincised heads, such as the Lone Pine [Bierman et al., 1995]\nand Fish Springs [Zehfuss et al., 2001] fans. Deposition on\nLone Pine fan occurred mainly between 140\u2013100, 32\u201320,\n14\u201310, and in the last 2 ka [Bierman et al., 1995], and\nbetween 135\u2013100, 34\u201322, 18\u201313 ka, and during the entire\nHolocene period on the Fish Springs fan [Zehfuss et al.,\n2001]. Both data sets provide an important temporal frame-\nwork on debris flow activity on Owens Valley fans, and\ndemonstrate how incision is responsible for the preservation\nof a long-term record of debris flow activity, but do not allow\nus to gauge along-strike variations in fan depositional\npattern, or the effects of catchment characteristics and fan\nhead incision on the fan surface record.\n[5] In order to investigate how the presence or absence of\nfan head incision controls the spatial patterns and timing of\ndebris flow deposition, we chose two adjacent debris flow\nfans in Owens Valley, Shepherd and Symmes creek fans.\nThe head of the Shepherd Creek fan is deeply incised, while\nthere is nearly no incision at the Symmes Creek fan head.\nWe expect that the spatial pattern of debris flow deposition\non Shepherd Creek fan should be similar to Lone Pine and\nFish Springs fans with multiple lobes of different ages. In\ncontrast, the pattern on Symmes Creek fan should be\nrelatively simple, with fewer lobes and a shorter deposi-\ntional record.\n[6] The goals of this paper are (1) to place absolute age\nconstraints on the timing of deposition on debris flow fans\nin the eastern Sierra Nevada, (2) to compare the absolute\ndepositional chronology with regional climate records, and\n(3) to evaluate the effects of fan head incision on the pattern\nof surface deposition. We also consider the implications of\nthese depositional chronologies for understanding paleoen-\nvironmental conditions and for the preservation of debris\nflow fan facies in the stratigraphic record. The mechanisms\nresponsible for fan head incision in this setting are beyond\nthe scope of this paper and are treated by Du\u00a8hnforth [2007,\nchapter 4].\n2. Setting\n[7] Symmes and Shepherd creek fans are situated on the\nwestern side of Owens Valley, California (Figures 1 and 2).\nThis area is tectonically dominated by dextral strike slip on\nthe Owens Valley Fault, east of the fan toes [Beanland and\nClark, 1994], and normal slip on the Sierra Nevada frontal\nfault [Gillespie, 1982], which offsets the fan heads\n(Figure 1). Late Quaternary normal-slip rates of \u00010.2 mm\nyr\u00021 on the Sierra Nevada frontal fault were documented by\nGillespie [1982]. The fans have surface areas of \u000120 km2\n(Symmes) and \u000130 km2 (Shepherd). Surface elevations rise\nfrom \u00011200 m above sea level at the distal part of the fans,\nto about 1875 m (Shepherd) and 1850 m (Symmes) at the\nfan heads. The head of Shepherd Creek fan is incised by\nabout 45 m, whereas incision of Symmes Creek fan head is\nless than 5 m (Figure 3). Transport of sediment to Symmes\nand Shepherd creek fans and deposition on the fan surface is\nmainly accomplished by debris flows derived from their\nrespective catchments. The fan surfaces are composed of\nabundant, crosscutting debris flow deposits with well-pre-\nserved debris flow channels, levees, and snouts [Whipple\nand Dunne, 1992] (Figure 4). Fluvial deposits on the fan\nsurfaces are scarce and only occur in the active channel and\nin some reworked former debris flow channels. Both catch-\nments and fans respond to local base level set by the Owens\nRiver.\n[8] The watershed area of Symmes Creek is 12 km2\ncompared with 36 km2 for the Shepherd Creek catchment.\nThe maximum catchment relief, defined as the difference\nbetween the elevation of the catchment mouth and the\nhighest elevation of the ridge crest, is 2540 m for Shepherd\nFigure 1. Shaded-relief map of our study location\nshowing the Sierra Nevada and Owens Valley, California.\nTopographic data are based on U.S. Geological Survey 10 m\nnational elevation data. Drainages of Shepherd and Symmes\ncreek fans are outlined in white. The black box indicates the\nlocation of Figures 2 and 5.

The catchments are\nunderlain by a series of Mesozoic granite, granodiorite and\nmonzonite plutons [Moore, 1963, 1981]. Today, the domi-\nnant sediment transport processes in both catchments are\ninferred to be bedrock landsliding, debris flows, and fluvial\ntransport and incision.\n[9] Both fan catchments are unglaciated today, but they\nwere affected by different degrees of glaciation during the\nlate Pleistocene [Brocklehurst and Whipple, 2002]. Longi-\ntudinal valley profiles show that while Shepherd Creek\ncatchment was significantly modified by glacial erosion,\nSymmes Creek catchment shows no apparent sign of glacial\nmodification [Brocklehurst and Whipple, 2002]. From this,\nwe infer that glacial occupation was significant in Shepherd\nCreek and minor (D. H. Clark, personal communication,\n2006) in Symmes Creek catchment.\n[10] Today, the climate of the eastern Sierra Nevada is\nmainly influenced by the westerly polar jet stream, which\nbrings precipitation from Pacific cyclones to this area.\nAnother source of precipitation occurs during the summer\nwhen monsoonal storms from the Pacific and the Gulfs of\nCalifornia and Mexico carry tropical moisture into Owens\nValley [Hales, 1974]. In total, the mean annual precipitation\non the Owens Valley floor is about 100\u2013150 mm yr\u00021 and\nincreases to more than 750 mm yr\u00021 at the range crest of the\nSierra Nevada [Hollet et al., 1991].\n[11] In summary, our study catchments have experienced\nsimilar tectonic displacement rates, base level conditions,\nand large-scale climatic forcing during the late Quaternary.\nThey differ largely in the degree of glaciation within the\ncatchments and in the presence or absence of fan head\nincision. We now examine the effects of these factors on the\ngeomorphology of the fan surfaces and the patterns of\nexposure ages.\n3. Debris Flow Fans\n[12] Debris flow fans are different from fluvial fans in\nboth the processes of sediment transport and deposition, and\nthe resulting surface morphology. Granular debris flows,\nsuch as those from the granitic catchments of the eastern\nSierra Nevada, leave behind a typically linear sediment\ndeposit consisting of a fairly straight, shallow channel,\nlateral levees that are relatively coarse grained compared\nto the body of the flow, and a coarse-grained snout (Figures 2\nFigure 2. Shaded-relief map of Shepherd and Symmes creek fans showing the textural fan surface\ncharacteristics. Topography is derived from airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM) topographic data with\nresolution of 1 m\/pixel. Line A\u2013B indicates the location of the topographic profile shown in Figure 3.\nThe fan boundaries are outlined by solid black lines; the active channels are shown by dotted white lines.\nBoundaries of the figure correspond with margins of the ALSM data and do not include all of the distal\nfan areas.

Note the incision of the Shepherd Creek\nfan head by about 45 m; in contrast, incision of the Symmes\nCreek fan head is less than 5 m.\nF03S15 DU\u00a8HNFORTH ET AL.: TIMING AND PATTERNS OF FAN DEPOSITION\n3 of 11\nF03S15\nand 4). Since deposition during a single debris flow is\ngenerally restricted to one or a few channel-levee com-\nplexes, the region of active deposition must shift laterally\nover time in order to resurface the whole fan [Dutton, 1880].\nShort-term shifts in the depocenter can occur abruptly\nbecause of channel blockage and avulsion during individual\nflow events [Beaty, 1963; Hooke, 1967; Whipple and\nDunne, 1992], and may be superimposed on a longer-term\nlateral or radial switching between different regions of the\nfan, producing distinct fan segments or lobes, driven by\nchanges in climatic, tectonic or base-level conditions. Areas\nof a fan that are low relative to surrounding regions are\nparticularly prone to avulsion and reoccupation by a new\nfan lobe. These shifts in deposition cause abandonment of\nthe active depocenter and lead to deposition on, and\nresurfacing of, formerly inactive fan areas.\n4. Methods\n4.1. Relative Fan Lobe Chronology\n[13] We mapped distinct fan lobes on Shepherd and\nSymmes creek fans using a variety of criteria, including\n(1) surface morphology and preservation of debris flow\ndeposits, (2) short-wavelength (1\u201310 m) surface relief,\n(3) boulder diameter, (4) degree of boulder weathering,\n(5) channel width, and (6) debris flow levee height. In the\nfield, we measured the diameter of at least 200 boulders per\nlobe, while the height of well-preserved levees was mea-\nsured with a differential GPS at \u00011 cm precision in 5\u201310\nplaces per lobe. Surface roughness and degree of boulder\nweathering were assessed qualitatively. Levee height was\nalso estimated, along with channel width between levee\ncrests, on digital airborne laser swath mapping (ALSM)\ntopographic data with a spatial resolution of 1 m\/pixel and a\nvertical accuracy of 5\u201310 cm (Figure 2). Height and width\nestimates were made approximately every 100 m along\nwell-preserved debris flow channels. Results from the\nALSM data agree to <0.5 m with our more limited field\nmeasurements of levee height.\n[14] We established the relative timing of different fan\nlobes using crosscutting relationships between debris flow\nchannels and differences in relative elevation. Contacts\nbetween adjacent lobes were defined on the basis of (1)\nabrupt lateral changes in surface morphology that could be\ntraced for tens to hundreds of meters, and (2) downlapping\ndebris flow deposits that define clear boundaries between\ntopographically distinct areas of the fan surface [e.g., Blair,\n1999]. Because the subdued relief on the distal fans makes it\ndifficult to map age relationships with confidence, we\nlimited our work to a radial length of about 5 km from\nboth catchment mouths.\n4.2. Absolute Fan Surface Ages\n[15] Using the relative fan surface chronology as a\nframework, we dated fan lobes using the in situ produced\ncosmogenic radionuclide 10Be. We sampled 32 granitic or\ngranodioritic boulders on different lobes to get a represen-\ntative distribution of surface exposure ages over the upper\nparts of both fans (Figure 5). Wherever possible, we took\nsamples from recognizable debris flow channel levees and\nsnouts, since these incorporate the largest boulders and are\nunlikely to have been moved or reworked by other processes\nafter deposition. We assume that measured ages give a\nprimary depositional age so that surface activity on each\nlobe occurred at least during the age range of our samples,\nand that lobe abandonment happened sometime after the\nFigure 4.

Thus our ages provide a maximum\nage for each lobe, and a minimum duration for deposition\non that part of the fan.\n[16] We only sampled boulders larger than 1 m in\ndiameter and standing more than 1 m above the fan surface,\nand took 3\u20135 cm thick flakes from flat-topped upper\nboulder surfaces. We preferred collecting boulders that were\nslightly varnished and covered by lichens and avoided\nboulders with obvious signs of recent erosion (e.g., spalling\nor fracturing) of the surface. On fan lobes with few\nappropriate sampling sites because of insufficient boulder\nsize or apparent boulder erosion, we collected fewer sam-\nples (a minimum of three per lobe). Consequently, the\nnumber of samples per lobe is not evenly distributed.\n[17] Our use of boulder exposure ages to constrain the\ntiming of debris flow deposition is potentially complicated\nby two factors: inherited 10Be due to significant prior\nexposure before deposition, and reworking of older boulders\nin later debris flows. To test for an inherited 10Be signal, we\nsampled boulders from debris flow levees on lobe F\n(Figure 5) along the active channel of Shepherd Creek.\nAssuming that these deposits represent the most recent\ndebris flow events on the Shepherd Creek fan, these boulders\nshould yield very young ages (on the order of a few ka) if\ninheritance is minimal, implying that residence times in the\ncatchment are short. While this approach allows us only to\nquantify the present degree of inheritance, it seems plausible\nthat inheritance during past glacial epochs should be even\nlower, given the likelihood of higher erosion rates and\nsediment discharge during those times (D. H. Clark, personal\ncommunication, 2006). Major reworking of older boulders\nshould be visible as a wide spread of ages on a single\ndepositional lobe and overlapping boulder ages between\nlobes. To minimize the chances of sampling reworked\nboulders, we limited our sampling to boulders whose ap-\npearance was representative for each lobe, and avoided\nboulders with greater degrees of surface weathering or desert\nvarnish than the majority. While this sampling approach may\nintroduce a slight bias toward younger exposure ages, the\neffect is unlikely to be important because the proportion of\n\u2018\u2018older-looking\u2019\u2019 boulders on each lobe was less than 5%.\n[18] We separated quartz from the boulder samples and\nextracted Be using standard techniques according to Kohl\nand Nishiizumi [1992], Ivy-Ochs [1996], and Ochs and Ivy-\nOchs [1997]. The isotopic ratios were determined by\naccelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at ETH Zu\u00a8rich. We\nran nine process blanks altogether and used their weighted\nmean ratio of 2.54 \u0003 10\u000214 \u00b1 2.12 \u0003 10\u000215 for the\ncorrection of the measured isotopic samples.

The\nproduction rates for 10Be were scaled for latitude and\nelevation after Stone [2000] and corrected for topographic\nshielding and sample thickness (Table 1). The exposure\nages listed in Table 1 have not been corrected for past\nvariations in the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. On the basis of the\nmodel of Masarik et al. [2001] this correction at this site\nwould be 4% or less. In contrast, on the basis of the model\nof Pigati and Lifton [2004], samples with ages ranging\nbetween 160 and 70 ka would have exposure ages that are\n\u000111% younger. For those with ages between 15 and 40 ka\nthis effect varies between \u00024 to +7%. Holocene ages would\nbe 10 to 18% older. Until a better consensus exists on the\nmethod of correcting, we do not make these corrections. We\nnote that changes in the ages of these magnitudes would\nhave little bearing on the conclusions made here.\n[20] To correct the exposure ages for the effect of boulder\nsurface weathering, we have assumed an erosion rate of 2 \u00b1\n0.5 mm ka\u00021. This is a reasonable rate for this area, climatic\nsetting, and rock type [Small et al., 1997; Zehfuss et al.,\n2001]. We use the assumed value, rather than a maximum\nerosion rate calculated by using the nuclide concentration in\nour oldest boulder, because we have no way of knowing if\nour sample has achieved steady state concentrations of 10Be,\nand there is no reason to believe that we sampled the oldest\nboulder on the fan. The error on each boulder age includes\nthe quadratic sum of the analytic uncertainty and the error\non the erosion rate. The averaged exposure age for each fan\nlobe is the arithmetic mean of boulder ages on that lobe \u00b1\none standard deviation.\n5. Results\n5.1. Relative Fan Lobe Chronology and Surface\nMorphology\n[21] The surface of Symmes Creek fan comprises a single\ndepositional lobe with nearly uniform surface characteristics\n(Figure 5). The debris flow channels are about 20\u201330 m\nwide and 2\u20133 m deep. Debris flow levees are well defined\nalong nearly all channels and are composed of mostly fresh,\nunweathered boulders with a maximum diameter of up to\n8 m. Debris flow snouts are common and are often nested\nwithin channels, showing repeated occupation of channels\nand progressive upstream deposition in successive surges or\nflows [Whipple and Dunne, 1992]. Areas between channels\nare mantled by grus. The active channel at the head of\nSymmes Creek fan is incised by less than 5 m into the fan\nsurface (Figure 3), and this incision depth is relatively\ninvariant downfan.\n[22] In contrast, the surface of Shepherd Creek fan can be\ndivided in the field into six different depositional lobes,\nnamed A to F in order of decreasing age (Figure 5). Lobes\nA\u2013E are preserved above the modern, active lobe F thanks\nto incision of the fan head by Shepherd Creek (Figure 3).\nThis incision decreases downfan from 45 m at the fan head\nto a few meters at a distance of 1.5 km from the head, and is\ninvariant below this point.\n[23] Lobe A is the oldest fan lobe and has a very smooth\nsurface, largely mantled by grus. No clearly recognizable\ndebris flow channels are preserved, and therefore no mea-\nsurements of channel width or levee height were made.\nLocal concentrations of large boulders may represent former\ndebris flow levees and snouts, although their geometry is\ndifficult to reconstruct. The boulders have diameters\nbetween 1 and 3 m, the largest up to 5 m. Some of these\nboulders are covered by desert varnish and show no\napparent sign of erosion. Others have a fractured surface\nwith clearly recognizable areas of surface erosion.\n[24] The next-youngest lobe B has clearly visible, radially\noriented ridges and channels. These probably represent\nrelict debris flow channels, but smoothing of the surface\nmakes it difficult to measure the original channel geome-\ntries. Boulders on this lobe are similar in their surface\ncharacteristics to boulders on lobe A, but are smaller on\nTable 1.

The abrupt eastern,\ndownfan margin of lobe B is formed by a north\u2013south\noriented line of pronounced debris flow snouts that downlap\nonto the topographically lower lobe A (Figure 4). These\nsnouts show that the transition from deposition on lobe A to\nlobe B was accompanied by a change to shorter debris flow\nrunout lengths, leading to a headward shift in the active\ndepocenter on the fan.\n[25] Lobe C is small in area and, like A, has a smooth,\ngrus-mantled surface without a recognizable channel-levee\nmorphology. Instead sedimentation has occurred in thin\n(<0.5 m), clast-rich lobate deposits. These deposits are\nelongate downfan, have relatively consistent widths of\nabout 15 m, and end in subdued, coarser-grained snouts.\nThe boundaries between the flow deposits and the interven-\ning, clast-free and grus-mantled fan surface are very sharp.\nCobbles and boulders are very abundant in the lobate\ndeposits, but the boulders are significantly smaller than\nthose on lobes A and B, with a mean diameter of less than\n1 m and very rare clasts to 3 m. In general, the boulders are\nunvarnished and relatively unweathered compared to those\non lobes A and B. During deposition on this surface,\nchannels appear to have either incised through deposits of\nlobe B or reactivated an older channel on lobe B to reach\ntheir present locations.\n[26] After abandonment of lobe C, the style of deposition\nshifted to channelized, leveed debris flow deposits on lobe\nD (Figure 5). Short-wavelength relief on this surface is\ngenerally 3\u20135 m because of prominent, well-developed\ndebris flow channels and levees. Channels are 25 to 35 m\nwide and about 1\u20132 m deep. The levees are composed of\nunweathered, mostly unvarnished boulders of intermediate\nsize (1\u20132 m). In comparison with lobes C and E, this lobe\nhas significantly more boulders deposited along its levees,\nand well-preserved boulder-rich snouts are much more\nfrequent.\n[27] The channels on lobe D are crosscut and partially\nmantled by the widespread deposits of lobe E, which covers\nat least one third of the proximal fan area (Figure 5). There\nare few debris flow channels on this lobe, but those that\nexist have widths of 50\u201360 m and depths of 2\u20133 m.\nBoulders on this lobe are rare and have generally diameters\nof less than \u00010.5 m. The most pronounced channel on this\nlobe has a maximum width of 100 m and extends a distance\nof about 3 to 4 km from the fan head (Figure 5). Small\npatches of older deposits, correlative with those on lobe C,\nthat are found near the head of this channel suggest that it\noriginally formed during activity on lobe C, and was\nreoccupied by debris flows during deposition of lobe E.\nThese patches also show that younger lobes may not\ncompletely cover older deposits, leaving \u2018\u2018windows\u2019\u2019 that\nexpose older flows. This can potentially complicate our\ninterpretations of surface morphology and exposure ages.\nAbandonment of lobe E coincided with the major incision\nof the fan head that characterizes the present-day Shepherd\nCreek fan.\n[28] The presently active lobe F consists of inset terraces\nand the floor of the incised channel at the head of Shepherd\nCreek fan, and the laterally equivalent depositional area\ndownfan (Figure 5). Debris flow channels are 15 to 25 m\nwide and less than 2 m deep. In comparison to other lobes\non Shepherd Creek fan, this surface is characterized by a\nvery high abundance of boulders with a mean diameter of\n1\u20132 m. These boulders are unweathered, show little to no\ndesert varnish, and form sharply defined levees and snouts\nas well as random boulder fields. Snouts are often nested or\nsuperimposed on each other within a single channel because\nof deposition in successive surges or debris flows. Of all the\nlobes on the Shepherd Creek fan, lobe F is most similar to\nthe surface of Symmes Creek fan in terms of its morphol-\nogy. The most prominent difference between the surfaces is\nthe depth of the debris flow channels, which is consistently\nlarger on the Symmes Creek fan.\n5.2. Fan Depositional Ages From Cosmogenic\nRadionuclides\n[29] Surface exposure ages were determined for 32 bould-\ners on the two fans (Table 2). If we assume no inheritance\nand a postdepositional boulder erosion rate of 2 \u00b1 0.5 mm\nka\u00021, our 10Be data yield ages of 7.5 \u00b1 0.4 to 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 ka on\nSymmes Creek fan, and 194.4 \u00b1 28.4 to 2.9 \u00b1 0.2 ka on\nShepherd Creek fan (Table 2 and Figure 5).\n[30] All four Symmes Creek fan samples yield Holocene\nages, consistent with our observations that the fan surface is\nrelatively uniform and shows excellent preservation of\nprimary debris flow deposits. The small number of samples\nmeans that we are unable to determine if the surface of\nSymmes Creek fan records intra-Holocene variations in\ndeposition, as inferred, for example, by Wells et al. [1987]\nfor fans in the Mojave Desert. In addition, the low nuclide\nconcentrations of the Symmes Creek fan samples, as well as\nthose from the active lobe F on Shepherd Creek fan (Table 2\nand Figure 5), show that inherited 10Be due to prior\nexposure in the catchment is relatively unimportant at\npresent, and that boulders were exposed for at most a few\nthousand years (comparable to the uncertainty on our many\nof our exposure ages, and in agreement with the \b2.0 ka\ninheritance inferred by Bierman et al. [1995]) before being\ntransported onto the fan surface. Thus we infer that the\nboulder exposure ages effectively date the time of debris\nflow deposition.\n[31] On Shepherd Creek fan, the oldest surface (lobe A)\nyields ages of 123.7 \u00b1 10.6, 86.0 \u00b1 5.8, and 80.9 \u00b1 5.2 ka.\nSix of the seven samples on lobe B are indistinguishable\nwithin error from the latter two ages, varying between 81.8 \u00b1\n4.8 and 74.2 \u00b1 4.2 ka. Thus the apparent transition from\nlobe A to lobe B may simply reflect the surface preservation\nof later flows closer to the fan apex on a single depositional\nlobe. It is possible that the seventh age on lobe B, 194.4 \u00b1\n28.4 ka, and the older age of 123.7 \u00b1 10.6 ka on lobe A, are\nnot representative of the true depositional age of this lobe.\nThis result could be explained by high nuclide inheritance\nof the two measured boulders, or it could be that they occur\nin \u2018\u2018windows\u2019\u2019 that expose an older, underlying fan lobe. On\nthe basis of our limited sampling, we cannot distinguish\nbetween these possibilities, but we consider the first more\nunlikely.\n[32] There is a gap of about 30 ka between the ages on\nlobe B and the oldest depositional age on lobe C. Two\nsamples collected from separate debris flow levees on lobe\nC yield ages of 31.1 \u00b1 1.4 and 31.1 \u00b1 1.3 ka, while a snout\non lobe C yields an age of 38.3 \u00b1 1.7 ka. These ages\npartially overlap, within error, the oldest ages on lobe D,\nwhich are between 32.9 \u00b1 1.5 and 22.6 \u00b1 0.9 ka. Recall that\nF03S15 DU\u00a8HNFORTH ET AL.: TIMING AND PATTERNS OF FAN DEPOSITION\n7 of 11\nF03S15\nlobes C and D are distinguished by their very different\nsurface characteristics in the field \u2013 thin lobate deposits on\nlobe C, and boulder-rich debris flow levee-channel com-\nplexes on lobe D. On the basis of our sampling, we cannot\ndetermine whether lobe C formed before deposition shifted\nto lobe D, or whether it represents a distinct episode, early\nin the deposition of lobe D, of unchannelized flows that\nwere relatively poor in large boulders.\n[33] Exposure ages on lobe E range from 39.9 \u00b1 2.2 ka to\n15.1 \u00b1 0.6 ka (Figure 5). Again, there is some overlap of the\nolder ages with those of the previously active fan lobe,\ndespite clear and spatially distinct differences in surface\nmorphology between lobes. The oldest boulder age of 39.9 \u00b1\n2.2 ka likely represents a \u2018\u2018window\u2019\u2019 exposing older fan\nsediments, as it occurs within a channel that appears to have\nbeen active during the formation of lobe C and later\nreoccupied during deposition of lobes D and E. Therefore\nit is possible that this boulder was originally deposited\nduring activity on lobe C. The remaining seven ages on\nlobe E are <29 ka, and three are <20 ka.\n[34] The final event recorded by our exposure ages on\nShepherd Creek fan is the incision of the fan head and\nabandonment of lobe E. This must have occurred sometime\nafter the youngest age on lobe E, 15.1 \u00b1 0.6 ka. As incision\nprogressed, the depocenter shifted basinward to establish\nlobe F, which yields ages of 11.1 \u00b1 0.5 to 2.9 \u00b1 0.2 ka. Four\nout of five sampled boulders on this lobe have ages ranging\nbetween 11.1 \u00b1 0.5 and 6.5 \u00b1 0.3 ka, whichmay suggest a focus\nof depositional ages during the early to middle Holocene.\n6. Discussion\n[35] In summary, the presence or absence of fan head\nincision leads to strikingly different fan surface character-\nistics and patterns of exposure ages. The surface of Symmes\nCreek fan is morphologically almost uniform and appears to\nhave undergone widespread resurfacing in the Holocene on\nthe basis of four 10Be exposure ages. In contrast, incision of\nthe Shepherd Creek fan head has led to the preservation of\nat least five, and probably six, geomorphically distinct\nlobes. The contacts between the lobes can be clearly\ndefined, and key surface characteristics such as boulder\ndiameter, surface roughness, development of debris flow\nlevees, and channel geometry, vary between lobes. Boulder\nexposure ages on Shepherd Creek fan are generally inter-\nnally consistent on individual lobes (Figure 6), with the\nexception of single older ages on Shepherd Creek lobes A,\nB, and E. While our samples provide only minimum\nestimates for the lifespan of each lobe, individual lobes\nappear to have remained active for periods of about 5\u2013\n15 ka, and in most cases were abandoned without any\nevidence of depositional hiatus. Successive, geomorphically\ndistinct lobes have exposure ages that are progressively\nyounger but generally overlap somewhat with adjacent\nlobes. For the moment, we do not know whether this\noverlap is a function of age uncertainty (partly because of\nboulder inheritance), exposure of older deposits through\nsurface \u2018\u2018windows,\u2019\u2019 or real variability in the locus of debris\nflow deposition.

We argue therefore that lobes A\u2013F, given\nthe uncertainty in our exposure ages, mark progressive\nshifts in the active fan surface through time. Our results\nemphasize that exposure age dating must be combined with\ncareful, independent field work in order to understand the\nevolution of fan surfaces.\n[36] Our ages show that debris flow deposition on Owens\nValley fans occurs during both glacial and interglacial times\n(Figure 6), as noted by Bierman et al. [1995] for the Lone\nPine fan. The spatially limited extent of the Holocene lobe F\non Shepherd Creek fan, the large MIS 2 lobes D and E, and\nthe relative paucity of interglacial exposures ages (Figure 6)\nalso lead us to concur with Bierman et al. [1995] that the\nHolocene debris flow deposition rate, and thus the Holocene\nsediment efflux from the Shepherd Creek catchment, is\nlikely to be lower than that of the Pleistocene. Note that\nthis inference is not necessarily incompatible with the\nHolocene resurfacing of the Symmes Creek fan. Given the\nvoluminous and areally extensive Pleistocene deposits on\nother fans in Owens Valley [Bierman et al., 1995; Zehfuss et\nal., 2001], it seems likely that similarly aged deposits are\npresent on Symmes Creek fan but are simply buried by\nwidespread Holocene deposits, and the lack of fan head\nincision has prevented preservation of older lobes. The\nspecific reasons for this Holocene decrease in debris flow\ndeposition must remain speculative [Bierman et al., 1991].\nWhile it is well established that glacial climates in the\nsouthwestern United States in general, and the Sierra\nNevada in particular, were cooler and significantly wetter\nthan today [e.g., Benson and Thompson, 1987; Benson et\nal., 1990; Thompson et al., 1993; Hostetler and Clark,\n1997; Menking et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004; Robert, 2004;\nStock, 2004; Kessler et al., 2006], the direct link between\nclimatic conditions and increased rates of either debris flow\noccurrence or sediment transport are not yet clear and\nremain a primary research objective.\n[37] More generally, our results point out the possible\nvariations in surface depositional chronology between ad-\njacent fans with similar tectonic and base level histories and\ncomparable climatic conditions, and we thus suggest that\ncaution must be used when inferring paleoenvironmental\nvariables from single fan surface records. We identify at\nleast two sources of this variation. The most obvious is due\nto the role of fan head incision in preserving or burying\nolder fan deposits. Comparison of exposure ages from\nShepherd Creek fan and other nearby fans with incised\nheads in Owens Valley, however, also reveals some impor-\ntant differences. The oldest exposed lobes on the well-dated,\nincised Lone Pine and Fish Springs fans yield multiple\nexposure ages in excess of 100 ka [Bierman et al., 1995;\nZehfuss et al., 2001]; in contrast, only two of our samples\nare as old, and both appear to be outliers on somewhat\nyounger depositional surfaces. Thus the Lone Pine and Fish\nFigure 6. Distribution of cosmogenic 10Be boulder ages on Shepherd and Symmes creek fans plotted\nagainst the Vostok dD record of Petit et al. [1999]. Error bars on the ages include analytical uncertainty\nand systematic errors in the production rate. Samples MD190305_1 and MD230305_3 (Table 2) are\nexcluded from this plot because of their old ages. Labels A\u2013F refer to fan lobes on Shepherd Creek fan.\nTiming and duration of marine isotope stages 2 and 4 based on the Vostok curve are indicated by gray\nboxes. These periods correlate with major glacial advances in the Sierra Nevada. The distribution of ages\nsuggests that debris flow deposition occurs during both glacial and interglacial periods but may be\nparticularly enhanced during glacials [Bierman et al., 1991, 1995].\nF03S15 DU\u00a8HNFORTH ET AL.: TIMING AND PATTERNS OF FAN DEPOSITION\n9 of 11\nF03S15\nSprings fans, despite comparable present-day amounts of\nfan head incision as the Shepherd Creek fan [Du\u00a8hnforth,\n2007, chapter 4], preserve surface evidence of an older\ndepositional episode not recorded by the Shepherd Creek\nfan. Conversely, we find evidence for deposition on lobes A\nand B between 74 and 86 ka (Figure 6), an age range that is\nnot found on the Lone Pine or Fish Springs fans. We\nsuggest that these apparent discrepancies are most likely\ndue to the vagaries of lobe preservation and abandonment\non debris flow fans. Given that older lobes may be rapidly\nburied and obscured by younger deposits following an\navulsion, and given that avulsions are likely to be somewhat\nstochastic in space and time, it seems unlikely that all fans\nin a given area will preserve the same surface record of fan\ndeposition, even without factoring in variables like fan head\nincision.\n[38] A final issue that is raised by our data is the effect of\nfan head incision on the stratigraphic record of fan deposi-\ntion. A seemingly obvious, but perhaps not widely\nappreciated, corollary of fan lobe switching is that the\nabandonment of large parts of the fan surface introduces\nlocal unconformities into the fan stratigraphy. Solely on the\nbasis of present-day exposure ages from Owens Valley fans,\nthese unconformities may cover much of the fan surface and\nrepresent missing time intervals of at least 100 ka. Note also\nthat unconformities are not limited to distal portions of the\nfan surface; the oldest exposed portions of the Shepherd\nCreek fan occur in the proximal fan area, and would\nrepresent the largest time gaps if those portions were to\nbe resurfaced. Thus a single section through an incised,\nShepherd-type fan at any one place may record only a\nfraction of the total depositional history, when in fact\ndeposition on the fan as a whole may be quasi-continuous\n(and may be better recorded by adjacent, unincised fans like\nSymmes Creek). Particularly in arid regions, such uncon-\nformities will be difficult to spot in the absence of signif-\nicant soil development between debris flow deposits or\nwithout sufficient datable material.\n[39] Thus, for all their potential utility, fan surfaces may\nnot necessarily reveal a complete record of sediment supply\nfrom their associated catchments. Depending on the pres-\nence or absence of fan head incision and the fan-specific\nhistory of avulsion events, a single fan surface will provide\nat best a portion of the true depositional history. Broad\nregional correlations between sediment supply, fan deposi-\ntion, and external driving forces, such as climatic conditions\nor tectonic displacement, should thus ideally be based on\nmultiple fan surface records.\n7. Conclusions\n[40] The presence or absence of fan head incision is a\nfirst-order control on the spatial patterns of debris flow\ndeposition and the length of the preserved surface chronol-\nogies on Shepherd and Symmes creek fans. The incised\nShepherd Creek fan surface consists of multiple depositional\nlobes, which are geomorphically distinct and appear to have\nbeen active and abandoned at different times. Cosmogenic\n10Be exposure ages are progressively younger on more\nrecently active fan lobes, but commonly overlap with ages\non adjacent lobes. This overlap may be a function of\nuncertainty on the exposure ages, or it may represent real\nvariability in the locus of debris flow deposition with time.\nLobes were active for periods of \u00015\u201315 ka before being\nabandoned by lateral or radial shifts in the fan depocenter.\nMajor debris flow deposition occurred during the late\nPleistocene glaciations of the Sierra Nevada, and to a\nsomewhat lesser extent during the Holocene. In contrast,\nthe unincised Symmes Creek fan is dominated by one major\ndepositional lobe, which has resurfaced the entire fan during\nthe Holocene. This complex variation in depositional timing\nbetween adjacent fans underscores the ability of fan head\nincision to preserve and isolate portions of the fan surface\nfor periods of up to 100 ka, introducing potentially signif-\nicant unconformities into the stratigraphic record on debris\nflow fans. In detail, the surface chronology recorded by\nShepherd Creek fan differs from those of other incised fans\nin Owens Valley, most likely due to stochastic avulsion\nevents on the fan surfaces that may obscure or bury older\nlobes. Our results suggest that attempts to link paleoenvir-\nonmental records with the timing of fan deposition, or to use\nfan surfaces as a proxy for tectonic or climatic conditions,\nshould be done with caution unless multiple fan records are\navailable for a region.\n[41] Acknowledgments.
