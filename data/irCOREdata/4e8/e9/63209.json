Introduction 27 \nThe global N cycle is being greatly perturbed by human activity and, in turn, impacts on ecosystems causing \nfurther global change. A very significant component of the perturbed global N cycle is the atmospheric \n 1\n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \ntransport of fixed N (Holland et al., 1999; Paerl and Whitall, 1999; Matson et al., 2002; Galloway et al., \n2004). Organic N represents an important component of atmospheric N (Cornell et al., 1995; Keene et al., \n2002; Cape et al, 2004), but its sources are essentially unknown (Cornell et al., 2003). Assessing whether \nthis material is of natural, anthropogenic or mixed origin is critically important in attempting to determine \nthe scale of human perturbation of the atmospheric N cycle.  \n \nAtmospheric organic N probably comprises a wide range of compounds from volatile gases through to \naerosols, with both primary (e.g. soil re-suspension, soot particles) and secondary production processes, e.g. \nthe reaction of atmospheric oxidised (e.g. nitric acid) and reduced (e.g. ammonia) N gas phase species with \ngas or aerosol organic matter. Investigation of individual compounds (Cornell et al., 2003) or the isotopic \ncomposition of atmospheric organic N (Kelly et al., 2005) has failed to provide clear evidence of whether \nanthropogenic or natural sources dominate, although it appears that most of the carbon is of natural origin \n(Kelly et al., 2005). An alternative approach to identifying the source is to investigate relationships between \norganic N and ammonium and nitrate in the atmosphere, which are known to be predominantly of \nanthropogenic origin except in the most remote regions of the world. This approach has been tried before on \ndata from particular regions with results that suggest a relationship, but it is only a weak one (Cape et al., \n2004; Neff et al., 2002). Here we have re-evaluated the relationship between atmospheric organic N and \ninorganic N deposition from a number of sites around the world, incorporating new data from China. Since \nthe Chinese data are new we present the methods by which it was measured and its interpretation before \ncombining it with other published data to consider the global pattern. The objective of this study is to gauge \nthe magnitude of organic N deposition in China, where N deposition is known to be high (Liu et al., 2006; \nZhang et al., 2006; He et al., 2007; Zhang et al., in press), and the origins of atmospheric organic N in China \nand worldwide.  \n \n2. Material and Methods 54 \n2.1. Monitoring sites \nRain samples were collected at fifteen monitoring sites (Fig.1; Table 1) in China, mainly from the North \nChina Plain (NCP) (sites 1-9). Other sites were from the Northeast China (site 10), the Changjiang River \nDelta (site 11), an Inner Mongolian pasture area (site 12), Northwest China (site 13) and the Tibetan \n 2\n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \nAltiplano (sites 14 and 15). The monitoring sites were located in different ecosystems such as farmland, \ncoast, pasture and forest. The location and monitoring period for each site are shown in Fig.1 and Table 1. \n \n2.2. Collection, storage and measurement of rainwater  \nPrecipitation samples (bulk deposition) were collected daily using a stainless steel bucket (SDM6, Tianjin \nWeather Equipment Inc., China). The buckets were cleaned with deionized water before rain collection to \navoid contamination (e.g. from bird faeces). Chloroform (1 ml L-1) was added to inhibit the growth of \nmicro-organisms and subsequent N transformation. Rainwater samples were filtered (0.45 \u03bcm pore size) and \nstored at -20 oC until analysis to avoid transformation of organic N (Cornell et al., 2003; Cape et al., 2001).  \n \nDIN (NH4-N and NO3-N) in rainwater was analyzed with a Continuous Flow Analyzer (TRAACS 2000, \nBran-Luebbe Inc., Germany). TDN in rainwater was analyzed using the alkaline persulfate-oxidation (to \nnitrate) method (Bronk et al., 2000) followed by ultraviolet spectrophotometry (Shimadzu UV-2201, \nShimadzu Inc., Japan). Organic N was then calculated by difference (TDN minus DIN).  \n \nThree Automatic Wet-only Samplers (APS series, Wuhan Tianhong Inc., China), which collected rainwater \nsamples only while the rainfall was occurring based on detection by rain sensors were separately installed at \nDBW, QZ and WQ (for the site key see Fig 1). The collection and analysis of wet deposition were the same \nas for bulk deposition. \n \n2.3. Statistical analysis \nWe used linear regression to analyze the relationship between DON and NH4-N, NO3-N and TDN in \nprecipitation and report significant correlations (if p<0.05, 0.001 or 0.0001).    \n \n3. Results and discussion 83 \n3.1. Spatial variation of DON deposition \nVolume-weighted concentrations, deposition and the proportion in the total deposition of NH4-N, NO3-N \nand DON at the 15 sites are summarized in Fig.2. DON concentration ranged from 14-176 \u00b5mol L-1 (Fig. \n2a), averaged 111 \u00b5mol L-1, and varied greatly between sites. In NCP (Fig 1b), the intensive agricultural area \nwhere DIN deposition was very high (Zhang et al., in press), the concentration of DON ranged from 43 to \n 3\n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n151 \u00b5mol L-1. Both higher concentrations and deposition were found at CEF, DBW and HM (Fig 2a, 2b). \nSites CEF and DBW are located in sub-urban areas, exposed to multi-pollutant emissions, while HM is \nlocated in a typical intensive agricultural region with large N fertilizer applications. At a national scale, the \nDON concentration at UR, also located in farmland, was comparable with other areas, but the deposition \nwas very low because of the lower rainfall (<200mm) in this arid region. The lowest deposition was found at \nDL in Inner Mongolia, a semi-arid temperate pasture region with little agricultural activity. At DA, QD and \nFH sites in the coastal area, both the concentration and deposition of DON are relatively high, accounting for \nits greater contribution to TDN compared with inorganic N. The N deposition at these three sites is probably \ninfluenced by both agricultural and coastal sources. Considerably higher proportions of DON to TDN (79% \nand 72%) compared to other sites were found at GGS and LZ (Fig. 2c) in the remote Tibetan area (almost) \nwithout anthropogenic influence, suggesting a significant natural background of DON deposition. The lower \nDIN concentrations and depositions here agreed with other data in the same Tibetan area (Ren et al., 1999; \nKang et al., 2000), but this is the first time that a major contribution of DON to atmospheric N deposition, \nprobably from natural sources, has been reported.  \n \nThe contribution of DON to TDN deposition was very variable across the fifteen monitoring sites and \nranged from 4% to 79%, being about 30% on average (Fig. 2c). This is consistent with results observed at \nother sites around the world (Peierls et al., 1997; Russell et al., 1998; Scudlark et al., 1998; Morales et al., \n2001; Keene et al., 2002; Cape et al., 2004; M\u00f6ller et al., 2005; Ham and Tamiya, 2006; Ham et al., 2006; \nCalder\u00f3n et al., in press). However, the DON concentrations at most sites in China were substantially higher \n(with a median value of 117 \u00b5mol L-1) compared to other sites around the world (with a median value of 13 \n\u00b5mol L-1) (Fig.3). The maximum TDN concentration was up to 412 \u00b5mol L-1. Taking the rainfall into \naccount, the annual TDN deposition ranged from 6 to 54 kg ha-1 yr-1, being 29 kg ha-1 yr-1 on average. The \n30% contribution of DON to TDN shows that DON must be measured when estimating TDN and its \npotential ecological significance (N\u00e4sholm et al., 1998; Breemen, 2002; Weigelt et al., 2003).  \n \n3.2. Difference of DON from bulk and wet deposition \nDON in both bulk and wet-only deposition was measured at three sites: DBW, QZ and WQ (Table 2). \nVolume-weighted DON concentrations in bulk deposition (145-161 \u00b5mol L-1) were consistently higher \nthan those in wet-only deposition (62-150 \u00b5mol L-1). The proportion of wet\/bulk deposition for DON was \n 4\n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n68% on average, and 80% and 77% respectively for inorganic N and total N deposition, with small \nvariations across the three sites. The lower contribution of DON to TDN in wet deposition implied that a \nlarger proportion of DON occurred as dry deposition - particulates, aerosols and reactive gases. Considering \nthat all three sites are located in agricultural areas and the difference between bulk and wet deposition arises \nmainly from coarse size particulates, we suggest that atmospheric dust, bacteria, organic debris, pollen and \nspores were the main sources. \n \n3.3. Relationship between organic N and ammonium, nitrate and total N in precipitation \nNo significant correlation was found between volume-weighted DON and NH4-N, NO3-N and TDN \nconcentrations in precipitation at the 15 sites in China. However, robust positive correlations (Fig. 4) were \nfound between volume-weighted DON and NH4-N, NO3-N and TDN concentrations in precipitation after \ndata from another 37 sites around the world are included (Scudlark et al., 1998; Russell et al., 1998; \nCampbell et al., 2000; Cornell et al., 2001; Neff et al., 2002; Mace et al., 2003a, b; Cape et al., 2004; Ham \nand Tamiya, 2006; Ham et al., 2006). The slope of the relationship between DON and TDN implies that \norganic N represents approximately 22% (R2=0.68, p<0.0001) of TDN deposition (Fig. 4c), consistent with \nother estimates (e.g. Cornell et al., 2003; Keene et al., 2002; Nakamura et al., 2007).  \n \nThe positive correlations between DON and NH4-N (R2=0.38, p<0.0001) and NO3-N (R2=0.46, p<0.0001) \nsuggest the same (or at least similar) origins for a substantial component of the organic, ammonium and \nnitrate N. We therefore interpret the relationships in Fig. 4 to mean that organic N deposition on a global \nscale has a significant anthropogenic component and should be treated as an enhancement of the global N \ncycle rather than as only a component of the natural background, although there were two sites in our study \nand other sites from remote locations that show a natural DON source as well. Our results do not identify the \nspecific sources of organic N deposition, but if the carbon component is of natural origin (Kelly et al., 2005) \nand the nitrogen of anthropogenic origin, this implies an important role for its formation by gas to particle \nreactions, consistent with the limited aerosol size distribution data available for aerosol organic N, although \nan important dust related DON component has been identified as well in the work of Mace et al. (2003b).  \n \n4. Conclustion 147 \n 5\nWe found clear evidence of atmospheric organic N deposition in China for the first time. The flux of DON \ndeposition ranged from 1 to 27 kg ha-1 a-1. The volume-weighted concentration of DON in rain in China was \n111 \u00b5mol L-1, much higher than the average reported values for the rest of the world. DON deposition \ncomprised approximately 30% of TDN deposition, agreeing well with other data from around the world, \nalthough as in other studies this proportion is very variable. This relatively constant proportion of DON and \nthe strong correlation between DON and DIN deposition suggest similar origins, which are largely attributed \nto anthropogenic emissions from both agricultural and industrial sources.  \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n 166 \n 167 \n168 \n 169 \n170 \n171 \n 172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis study was supported by Programs for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-06-0111), \nChangjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University IRT0511, the National Natural Science \nFoundation of China (Grants 20577068, 40771188), and the Sino-German project (DFG Research Training \nGroup, GK1070).
