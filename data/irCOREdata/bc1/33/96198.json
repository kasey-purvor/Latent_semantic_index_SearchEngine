An agency-based approach \nChristian List and Mathias Koenig-Archibugi\u2217 \nThis version: 24 September 2009 \nThe world is increasingly characterized by transnational interdependence, cross-border \npolicy externalities and the widely perceived need to provide certain global collective \ngoods and to avoid global collective bads. Consider, for example, the problem of climate \nchange and the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions; the problem of global refugee \nflows and the commitment to protect the human rights of forced migrants; and the \nproblem of controlling and eradicating infectious diseases that can spread very fast, such \nas new forms of influenza. In all these cases, the need for \u201cglobal governance\u201d, that is, \nthe challenge to make good collective decisions and to coordinate actions transnationally, \nis more pressing than ever. There are at least two dimensions of this challenge. First, \nglobal public goods are typically underprovided, and global public bads over-occur, in \npart because there are too few mechanisms to prevent free-riding at the global level (the \n\u201cefficiency dimension\u201d).1 And second, where global public goods are provided, and \nglobal public bads avoided, this is often the result of bargaining based on differential \n                                                 \n\u2217\n C.

The incentive to supply global public goods (Oxford, New York: \nOxford University Press, 2007). We use the term public goods broadly to include common pool resources. \n 2 \npower and resources rather than the product of a process generally perceived as \nlegitimate (the \u201clegitimacy dimension\u201d).2 \nSimilar challenges arise in national contexts too, but there they are usually met through \nwell-established institutions with enforcing powers and democratic mechanisms for \nburden-sharing based on widely held norms of distributive justice. The former ensure \nefficiency, the latter legitimacy. There is no shortage of proposals for institutional designs \nthat might perform similar functions at the global level, but it is often held that such \ninstitutions would be unlikely to be established and that, even if they were established, \nthey would not function properly. In particular, it is said, they would lack the required \nsocial basis that supports equivalent institutions at the national level. What is missing at \nthe global level, so the argument goes, is a \u201cdemos\u201d.3  \nOn this picture, the lack of a global demos hinders good global governance, that is, \nsuccessful global collective decision-making and coordinated action. Conversely, if a \nglobal demos existed, it would facilitate efficient and legitimate global governance, for \ninstance by promoting the emergence of supranational institutions or by shaping the \npolicies of national ones. But what is actually meant by a \u201cglobal demos\u201d? The notion of \na demos, let alone that of a global one, is less well established than other political notions \nsuch as the notion of a state, and so a careful conceptual analysis is needed.4 And could a \nglobal demos \u2013 assuming it has been defined properly \u2013 ever come into existence and \nsucceed at facilitating good global governance, as has been suggested? This paper seeks \nto offer a new theoretical perspective on these questions. \n                                                 \n2\n See, e.g., Thomas Pogge, World Poverty and Human Rights (Cambridge: Polity, 2002) and David Held, \n\u201cDemocratic Accountability and Political Effectiveness from a Cosmopolitan Perspective,\u201d in Global \ngovernance and public accountability, ed. David Held and Mathias Koenig-Archibugi (Oxford: Blackwell, \n2005), pp. 240-267. \n3\n In a related vein, J. H. H. Weiler coined the phrase \u201cno-demos thesis\u201d in relation to the European Union \nand its post-Maastricht predicament. See J. H. H. Weiler, \u201cDoes Europe Need a Constitution? Demos, \nTelos and the German Maastricht Decision,\u201d European Law Journal 1(3) (1995): 219-258. \n4\n See, however, David Miller\u2019s recent paper, \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Domain,\u201d Philosophy and Public Affairs 37(3) \n(2009): 201-228, which came to our attention after we completed the present paper. We briefly compare \nMiller\u2019s interesting analysis with ours in a later note. \n 3 \nThe current debate about the global demos is divided between two opposing camps, \nwhich differ on both conceptual and empirical levels. On the one hand, there are the \n\u201cpessimist\u201d or \u201cimpossibilist\u201d views, according to which the emergence of a global \ndemos is either conceptually or empirically impossible. On the conceptual version of this \nview, the very notion of a global demos is incoherent, while on the empirical one we are \nfaced with a vicious circle in which the absence of a global demos both leads to, and is \nreinforced by, the absence of successful institutions for global governance. On the other \nhand, there are the \u201coptimist\u201d or \u201cpossibilist\u201d views, according to which the emergence of \na global demos is conceptually as well as empirically possible and an embryonic version \nof it already exists. On this view, there exists a virtuous circle in which existing global \ninstitutions promote the development of a global demos, which in turn can strengthen \nglobal institutions. However, since the two camps agree neither on a common working \ndefinition of a global demos, nor on the relevant empirical facts, it is difficult to reconcile \ntheir conflicting outlooks. \nOur aim is to move the debate beyond its current stalemate. We argue that existing \nconceptions of a demos are ill-suited for capturing precisely what kind of a global demos \nis needed in order to facilitate good global governance, and we propose a new conception \nof a demos that is better suited for this purpose. In particular, we suggest that some of the \nmost prominent conceptions of a demos have focused too much on the question of who \nthe members of a demos are and too little on the question of what functional \ncharacteristics it must have in order to perform its role in facilitating governance within \nthe relevant domain. Our new proposal shifts the emphasis from the first, \n\u201ccompositional\u201d question to the second, \u201cperformative\u201d one, and thereby provides a more \n\u201cagency-based\u201d account of a global demos. The key criterion that a collection of \nindividuals must meet in order to qualify as a demos, we suggest, is that it is not merely \ndemarcated by an appropriate membership criterion, but that it can be organized, in a \ndemocratic manner, so as to function as a state-like agent, as explained in the course of \nour argument. Compared to the existing, predominantly \u201ccompositional\u201d approaches to \nthinking about the demos, this agency-based approach puts us into a much better position \nto assess the empirical prospects for the emergence of a global demos that can facilitate \ngood global governance. \n 4 \nThe paper is structured as follows. In section I, we introduce two approaches to \nconceptualizing a \u201cdemos\u201d, the \u201ccompositional\u201d and the \u201cperformative\u201d ones, and argue \nthat the compositional approach alone is insufficient for capturing the role a demos is \nsupposed to play in facilitating governance. In section II, we propose and defend our \nown, \u201cagency-based\u201d approach, which focuses on the performative dimension of the \ndemos but keeps lessons from the compositional approach on board. In section III, we \noffer a first operationalization of this approach, so as to allow for diachronic and global-\nnational comparisons. However, we present this operationalization only as a tentative \napproximation, in the hope that it will inspire more extensive research. In order to show \nthat a global demos is in principle possible under our agency-based conception, we \ndevote section IV to an illustrative case study of how the emergence of a global demos \nmight be promoted through some forms of transnational deliberation. Section V, finally, \ncontains some concluding remarks. \nOur paper builds on ideas from several different fields, including international political \ntheory,5 the theory of group agency,6 and theories of deliberation and social choice.7 \nAlthough many of the elements of our approach are well established in those fields, the \nnovelty of our approach lies in the particular way in which these elements are put \ntogether so as to illuminate the notion of a global demos. \n                                                 \n5\n E.g., Terry Macdonald, \u201cBoundaries Beyond Borders: Delineating Democratic \u2018Peoples\u2019 in a Globalizing \nWorld,\u201d Democratization 10(3) (2003): 173-194; Thomas Christiano, \u201cA Democratic Theory of Territory \nand Some Puzzles about Global Democracy,\u201d Journal of Social Philosophy 37(1) (2006): 81-107; and \nRobert E.

TWO APPROACHES TO CONCEPTUALIZING A DEMOS \nWhat is a demos? Or more precisely, what is a demos in relation to a particular set of \nissues or policy area? Adapting a distinction used in the theory of group agency, we can \ndistinguish between two ways of approaching this question.8 We can either ask who a \ndemos is composed of, that is, what its membership criterion is. Call this the \n\u201ccompositional\u201d approach. Or we can ask what functional characteristics it must have in \norder to perform its role in guiding decisions in relation to the given set of issues or \npolicy area. Call this the \u201cperformative\u201d approach.  \nIn what follows we begin with a discussion of the compositional approach, which has \nbeen the dominant one in existing debates on the idea of a global demos. We distinguish \ntwo variants of the approach, but find both of them unsatisfactory. Firstly, it is difficult to \nadjudicate which variant is the correct one, and, secondly and more importantly, in either \nvariant the approach leaves open the question of whether a demos as defined by it can \nachieve what it is supposed to do, namely to facilitate governance, that is, decision-\nmaking and action-taking. This leads us to the performative approach. While its two most \nestablished variants exhibit some crucial limitations, it provides useful insights for the \ndevelopment of our own, \u201cagency-based\u201d approach in the subsequent section. \nThe compositional approach \nAs we have noted, the compositional approach defines the demos for a particular set of \nissues by providing a membership criterion.9 The identification of such a criterion has \nbeen the central goal in the debate on the so-called \u201cboundary problem\u201d.10 There are two \n                                                 \n8\n Christian List and Philip Pettit, Group Agency (op. cit.). \n9\n As discussed below, on some accounts it only ever makes sense to define the demos in relation to the all-\nencompassing set of all issues, while on other accounts there can be issue-specific demoi. \n10\n E.g., Robert A. Dahl, After the revolution? Authority in a good society (New Haven, London: Yale \nUniversity Press, 1970); Frederick G. Whelan, \u201cPrologue: Democratic Theory and the Boundary Problem,\u201d \nin Nomos XXV: Liberal Democracy (New York: New York University Press, 1983); Macdonald, \n\u201cBoundaries Beyond Borders\u201d (op. cit.); Goodin, \u201cEnfranchising All Affected Interests\u201d (op. cit.); Miller, \n\u201cDemocracy\u2019s Domain\u201d (op. cit.). \n 6 \nmain rival criteria in the literature.11 One is the \u201caffectedness criterion\u201d, according to \nwhich all those (potentially) affected by decisions on the given issues are entitled to take \npart in those decisions and should therefore be members of the demos.12 The other is the \n\u201caffectivity criterion\u201d, according to which the demos is defined by underlying cultural \ncommonalities and a shared identity, at least with regard to the given issues. Often those \ncommonalities and identity are defined in terms of nationality, since \u2013 as argued, for \ninstance, by Will Kymlicka \u2013 \u201cterritorialized linguistic\/national political units provide the \nbest and perhaps the only sort of forum for genuinely participatory and deliberative \npolitics\u201d.13 But this focus on nationality is conceptually distinct from, and not implied by, \nthe claim that underlying commonalities and a shared identity provide the criterion of \nmembership in a demos.14 \n                                                 \n11\n In fact, both criteria have a number of different variants, but we set the details aside here. A third \napproach \u2013 whereby the demos is defined as the set of those individuals that happen to be nationals of a \nstate that is governed democratically \u2013 is not relevant here. \n12\n The sentence \u201cQuod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur\u201d was first used in a constitutional rather than \nprivate law sense in the 13th century, most famously in the writ by King Edward I of England that \nsummoned the bishops and abbots to the so-called Model Parliament of 1295. See Brian Tierney, \u201cFreedom \nand the Medieval Church,\u201d in The Origins of Modern Freedom in the West, ed. R. W. Davies (Stanford: \nStandford University Press, 1995), pp. 86-88.  \n13\n Will Kymlicka, Politics in the Vernacular: Nationalism, Multiculturalism, and Citizenship (Oxford: \nOxford University Press, 2001), p. 324. \n14\n In his recent paper, \u201cDemocracy\u2019s Domain\u201d (op. cit.), David Miller has made the interesting suggestion \nthat the difference between two approaches to delimiting the demos \u2013 one that stresses the inclusion of all \naffected interests and another that stresses the role of sympathetic identification, underlying agreement on \nethical principles, interpersonal trust, and stable relationships \u2013 derives at least in part from a deeper \ndifference between a \u201cliberal\u201d and a \u201cradical\u201d conception of democracy. Miller argues that liberal \ndemocrats, for whom democracy is mainly instrumentally valuable, tend to look favourably on the principle \nof affected interest. By contrast, radical democrats, for whom democracy is principally intrinsically \nvaluable, tend to emphasize sympathetic identification, underlying agreement on ethical principles, \ninterpersonal trust, and the existence of stable relationships as delimitation criteria for the demos. Miller \nsuggests that the latter factors are privileged by radical democrats because they are \u201cqualities that a group \nof people must possess in order to function as a demos\u201d (pp. 207-208). At first sight, this may seem to \nsuggest that radical democrats are more interested in the \u201cproper functioning\u201d of the demos than liberal \ndemocrats are, and thus that the former lean more towards what we call the \u201cperformative\u201d approach to \n 7 \nFrom a conceptual perspective, neither membership criterion as just defined, affectedness \nor affectivity, rules out the possibility of an issue-specific demos. For example, several of \nus may be affected by decisions regarding the city of London and thereby qualify as \nfellow Londoners, but not by decisions regarding a particular local project, say at our \nuniversity, and thereby fail to qualify as fellow members of the relevant, more local \ndemos. Similarly, we could all have a shared identity qua being Londoners, which does \nnot extend to issues that have nothing to do with London, and so we might belong to \ndifferent \u201cdemoi\u201d in relation to those other social, religious or cultural issues. Thus, on \nboth membership criteria, demoi can in principle be issue-specific. However, one might \nalso amend each criterion with a further requirement that, in order to belong to the same \ndemos, people must exhibit a shared affectedness across multiple issues, or a shared \nidentity in some overarching, privileged respect, not just one restricted to a narrow set of \nissues.15 With such an amendment, a demos would always have to be defined in relation \nto a broader, perhaps all-encompassing set of issues.16 \nWhether we use affectedness or affectivity for defining the membership of a demos \nmakes a real difference. Given the empirical fact of significant cross-border externalities \nof a large number of policy decisions, the first criterion would point towards a very \ninclusive, possibly even global demos for many policy areas. If one accepts that the \n                                                                                                                                                 \nconceptualizing the demos, while the latter lean more towards the \u201ccompositional\u201d one. However, we \nwould resist this suggestion. Precisely because liberal democrats focus on the ability of democracy to \nproduce desirable outcomes such as a larger aggregate social welfare, they have no less interest in its \nproper functioning than radical democrats. For this reason, we think that it is more appropriate to maintain \nthat every democrat takes (or should take) an interest in securing the existence of a well-functioning demos, \nbut also that such functioning can be conceptualized in a number of different and potentially contrasting \nways. The bulk of our paper deals with the task of providing a more precise and operationalizable \ninterpretation of the idea of functioning, in the context of what we call an \u201cagency-based\u201d approach to \nconceptualizing the demos. \n15\n Indeed, many proponents of the affectivity criterion hold that, in reality, a demos requires one level of \nidentity to take priority over others (that is, there cannot be multiple issue-specific demoi). \n16\n In \u201cA Democratic Theory of Territory\u201d (op. cit.), Thomas Christiano argues that democratic boundaries \nshould be drawn around \u201ccommon worlds\u201d. For a group of individuals, a common world is \u201ca world in \nwhich all or nearly all the individuals\u2019 fundamental interests are intertwined with each other\u201d (p. 97). \n 8 \ndemos is in principle unbounded,17 then a global demos is normatively justified by the \nconjunction of the affectedness criterion and the empirical fact that \u201c[t]he growth of \ntransboundary problems creates [\u2026] \u2018overlapping communities of fate\u2019; that is, a state of \naffairs in which the fortune and prospects of individual political communities are \nincreasingly bound together\u201d, as noted by David Held and Anthony McGrew.18 Robert \nGoodin has elaborated on the globalizing implications of the affectedness criterion and \ndiscussed ways to attenuate its impact.19  \nThe affectivity criterion, by contrast, usually implies a bounded demos, at least under \npresent empirical conditions.20 As Kymlicka observes in his critique of Held\u2019s \ncosmopolitanism, \u201cwhat determines the boundaries of a \u2018community of fate\u2019 is not the \nforces people are subjected to, but rather how they respond to those forces, and, in \nparticular, what sorts of collectivities they identify with when responding to those forces. \nPeople belong to the same community of fate if they care about each other\u2019s fate, and \nwant to share each other\u2019s fate\u201d.21  \nGiven the affectedness and affectivity criteria alone, then, it is not clear how to demarcate \nthe demos in many circumstances. Consider the common case in which the set of \nindividuals potentially affected by a decision is much wider than the set sharing affective \nbonds and identities.

What makes those \nfactors matter, in ways that justify constituting our demoi around them, is the way that those factors lead to \npeople\u2019s interests being intertwined. [\u2026] The reason we think that territorial or historical or national groups \nought make decisions together is that, typically if not invariably, the interests of individuals within those \ngroups are affected by the actions and choices of others in that group\u201d (p. 48). \n 9 \naffectedness criterion would hope that common experiences will promote a we-feeling \nand would support policies that intentionally further its development. The active \npromotion of such feelings and the pursuit of appropriate policies can be described as \n\u201cidentity-expanding strategies\u201d. Proponents of the affectivity criterion, by contrast, would \nfavour policies that limit or reduce the ways in which decisions taken within one \ncommunity affect the interests of others, for instance by strengthening state sovereignty \nand limiting economic interdependence. Such attempts to reduce the number of people \naffected by certain decisions can be described as \u201cexternality-limiting strategies\u201d.22 But \nneither the identity-expanding strategies nor the externality-limiting ones will always be \nsuccessful when there is an incongruence between affectedness and affectivity. Identities \ncannot always be molded and externalities are often hard to contain.  \nHowever, even if we were able to adjudicate between the two criteria in cases of conflict, \nthere would be no guarantee that the collection of individuals picked out by a given \ncriterion will be able to perform the role of guiding decisions and coordinating actions on \nthe relevant set of issues. It is possible, for example, that the set of all people potentially \naffected by a particular decision exhibits so much internal discord and disagreement that \nit can deliver no policy guidance whatsoever. Similarly, sharing a common identity and \nexhibiting some affective bonds is not the same as being able to generate a coherent \ncollective stance on the issues in question, on which policy decisions can be based and \nenacted.  \nIn short, if we try to define the demos in terms of a membership criterion alone, it is not \nguaranteed that the resulting \u201cdemos\u201d can support \u201ckratos\u201d, the second and equally \nimportant etymological component of \u201cdemocracy\u201d. We also need to look at the demos\u2019s \nperformance in facilitating governance. \n                                                 \n22\n Macdonald, in \u201cBoundaries Beyond Borders\u201d (op. cit.), develops a similar argument about how different \napproaches mandate either the \u201calignment\u201d of boundaries of power to the boundaries of legitimate \nsolidaristic peoples or vice versa, although we would not describe the contrast as one between \u201cidealist\u201d \nand \u201crealist\u201d approaches (pp. 178-179).

As in the case of the \ncompositional approach, we can extract two main variants from the literature.  \nOn one variant, which we call the \u201cpopulist\u201d one, a collection of people counts as a \ndemos if it can be said to have a general will.23 Although this idea can be fleshed out in a \nnumber of ways, at a minimum it requires that it make sense, from the perspective of an \nimpartial but well-informed observer, to ascribe coherent collective preferences to the \ncollection. On another variant, which we call the \u201cdiscursive\u201d one,24 the mark of a demos \nis not the presence of a coherent general will, but rather the interconnectedness of its \nmembers in a sufficiently closely knit network of communicative interactions or \n\u201cdiscourses\u201d. The details of this idea can be variously spelt out, but what matters is a \ncertain kind of internal \u201ccohesion\u201d among the members. This cohesion need not preclude \ndiversity among them \u2013 in fact, some of the most prominent demoi in the world exhibit \nsignificant internal pluralism \u2013 but it does require participation and interaction within a \nshared public sphere. \nDespite capturing some key prerequisites for democratic governance, both variants of the \nperformative approach have their shortcomings. The populist variant, by focusing on \nwhether a general will can be coherently ascribed to a given group, runs the risk of not \n                                                 \n23\n The use of the term \u201cpopulist\u201d here is inspired by William Riker, Liberalism Against Populism (San \nFrancisco: W. H. Freeman, 1982). \n24\n Inspired by J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Faktizit\u00e4t und Geltung: Beitr\u00e4ge zur Diskurstheorie des Rechts und des \ndemokratischen Rechtsstaats (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1992), pp. 364-366.

The mere fact that a group, when looked at impartially from the outside, \nappears to have a \u201cgeneral will\u201d is entirely consistent with the lack of any internal \ncohesion required for successfully implementing collective decisions on that basis. \nAlthough an extreme populist might try to explain this away by claiming that, in such \ncases of destructive internal disunity, a part of the group is \u201cin error\u201d over what its will is \nor how to enact it, the weakness of defining the demos in populist terms is its lack of \nsociological sophistication. \nThe discursive variant of the performative approach, by contrast, is more nuanced with \nrespect to social details: It focuses precisely on the networks of interactions and systems \nof discourses present within a group. Its weakness, however, lies in its insufficient focus \non the criteria for determining what the group as a whole wants or even on whether there \nexists a coherent answer to this question. If the demos is to play a central role in \nfacilitating good governance \u2013 or, expressed more bluntly, if policies are to be guided by \n\u201cwhat the demos wants\u201d \u2013 then the possession of coherent collective preferences is \ncrucially important. Recall that this is exactly the insight underlying the populist \napproach, where it is expressed, however, in a way that is too detached from the social \nbasis underlying the ascribed collective will. \nIt seems, then, that both the populist and the discursive variants of the performative \napproach are onto something correct, but they each get only part of the picture right. The \nmain insight of the populist variant is that, for a set of individuals to function as a demos, \nit must be possible to ascribe coherent attitudes to it, at least on the issues on which the \ndemos is to guide and legitimize policies and actions. And the main insight of the \ndiscursive variant is that, in order to function as a demos, a set of individuals must exhibit \nsufficient internal cohesion to allow the successful implementation of those policies and \nactions. Our proposal in the next section builds on both of these insights, while also \nkeeping the earlier, compositional question about the demos in sight. \n 12 \nII. AN AGENCY-BASED APPROACH \nWhat we can learn from contrasting the compositional and performative approaches is \nthat there are two genuinely distinct questions about a demos:   \nThe compositional question: Which collection(s) of individuals should be \nconsidered as candidate(s) for a demos for a given policy area or set of issues? In \nparticular, what membership criterion should be employed for specifying such a \ncollection?  \nThe performative question: For any such collection of individuals, what \nfunctional characteristics must it exhibit in order to guide collective decision-\nmaking and to enable coordinated actions on the given set of issues? \nAlthough these two questions are obviously related to each other \u2013 for example, some \nmembership criteria may fail to specify collections that could possibly function well on \nthe performative dimension \u2013 they should not be confused with each other, and in our \nview a satisfactory account of the demos must address both of them.25  \nThe first, compositional question is, to a large extent, a normative question. Principles \nspecifying who should be included in any given collective decision process are normative \nprinciples of democracy, and although certain consequentialist or efficiency standards \nmay guide our choice of those principles, this fact makes that choice no less normative. \n(Of course, once we have identified an appropriate normative criterion of membership, \nthe question of which collection(s) of individuals the criterion picks out becomes a \ndescriptive one, and hence empirical considerations will still play a role in identifying \nsets of people that are possible candidates for demoi.) Our personal view is that, on \naffectedness grounds, we have good reasons to consider all of humanity a possible \ncandidate for a demos, at least with regard to issues of global reach, but there can still be \n                                                 \n25\n It is entirely conceivable, of course, that there are correlations between certain compositional criteria and \ncertain performative ones, in that groups satisfying the one set of criteria may also be likely to satisfy the \nother. However, such correlations are a contingent matter and do not undermine the fact that, conceptually, \nthe compositional and performative questions about the demos are distinct. \n 13 \nreasonable disagreement on this question, especially if affectivity as well as affectedness \nis assumed to matter. \nSo let us turn to the second, performative question. Once our normative membership \ncriterion, together with some empirical information about who meets that criterion, has \nled us to focus on a particular collection of individuals \u2013 be it humanity as a whole, or the \npopulation of some territory \u2013 it becomes largely a positive, social-scientific question as \nto whether that collection can actually perform the role expected of a demos. Or at least it \nbecomes such a question once we have specified what exactly that role requires, namely \nto guide collective decision making and to facilitate coordinated action. There will still be \na normative element in giving the details of this requirement; later we look at a concrete \noperationalization.  \nHighly divided societies, for example, may sometimes fail on this performative count, at \nleast temporarily. However normatively desirable it may have seemed, for instance, to \nexpect the population of Iraq to function as a demos after the American invasion in 2003, \nthe level of social discord initially precluded this (due to a variety of factors, to which the \ninvasion and occupation undoubtedly contributed). As efforts of nation building progress, \nthe situation in Iraq will hopefully improve, but it should be clear that there are very real, \nfactual constraints on whether a particular collection of individuals can function well in \nguiding collective decision making and facilitating action. The performative question \nabout the demos takes those constraints seriously.  \nIn the remainder of this paper, we concentrate on this second, performative question, for \ntwo reasons. First, there are already well-established off-the-shelf membership criteria, \nsuch as affectedness and affectivity, by which we can answer the first, compositional \nquestion, whereas the analysis of the second question \u2013 that is, what functional \ncharacteristics a collection of individuals must exhibit to function as a demos \u2013 is less \ndeveloped. Second, as we have seen, there may be alternative strategies for promoting or \nrestoring congruence between different membership criteria \u2013 e.g., the identity-expanding \nand externality-limiting strategies \u2013 when the sets of individuals picked out by them do \nnot coincide. The application of an appropriate performative criterion can help choose \nbetween those alternative strategies, as only one \u2013 but not the other \u2013 of these strategies \n 14 \nmight be able to yield a collection of individuals that meets that performative criterion. \nAs we have mentioned, the two variants of the performative approach reviewed above \nwill provide useful inspiration for our task, but, in order to introduce the central idea, it is \nhelpful to bring in the notion of group agency. \nA demos as a collection capable of democratic agency \nThe capacity to make decisions and to take actions, as opposed to exhibiting mere \nbehaviour, is one of the distinguishing features of an agent. Agency can be defined in \nthicker and thinner ways, and on some accounts even a device as simple as a thermostat \ncan count as an agent, though of course not as a particularly sophisticated, let alone \nconscious one. For the present purposes, we define an \u201cagent\u201d thinly as a system which  \n\u2022 has attitudes \u2013 which can be described as \u201cbeliefs\u201d and \u201cpreferences\u201d \u2013 on the \nissues it faces,  \n\u2022 and acts (by making decisions or taking actions) in such a way as to \u201cpursue\u201d its \nattitudes \u2013 in particular, to satisfy its preferences, as far as possible, in accordance \nwith its beliefs.26  \nHumans, cats and dogs \u2013 and with a little stretch even thermostats \u2013 come out as agents \nunder this definition, while rocks, armchairs and cars (without a driver) do not. A thesis \nthat is increasingly receiving attention is that certain groups or collections of individuals \ncan constitute agents in their own right, provided they are organized in an appropriate \nway.27 Corporations or cohesive multi-member courts may be the paradigmatic examples \nof group agents, taking attitudes on issues within particular domains and acting in \naccordance with those attitudes, but well-functioning states, which are particularly \nimportant for our present analysis, equally qualify, since they, too, take attitudes on a \nlarge range of issues and systematically pursue them, ideally on the basis of a democratic \nprocess. \n                                                 \n26\n This way of defining an agent follows List and Pettit, Group Agency (op. cit.) and Daniel Dennett, The \nIntentional Stance (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987). \n27\n List and Pettit, Group Agency (op. cit.). \n 15 \nOf course, it would be preposterous to suggest that a demos, which is not the same as a \nstate but at most an \u201cingredient\u201d of a state, should be a fully fledged group agent. Even if \na state, understood as the composite system consisting of a demos and a suitable set of \ninstitutions, might fit the definition of an agent, the demos by itself, without the relevant \ninstitutions, need not. What we do suggest, however, is that, in order to function as a \ndemos, a collection of individuals must at least be capable of being incorporated into \nsuch a state-like group agent. Moreover, this must be possible through some democratic \nform of organization, rather than, for instance, only in an authoritarian manner. Thus the \nkey condition for functioning as a demos is the following:  \nCapacity for democratic agency: The collection of individuals in question has the \ncapacity (not necessarily actualized) to be organized, in a democratic manner, in \nsuch a way as to function as a state-like group agent. \nIt is important to emphasize that the reference to democratic organization does not make \nthe use of this condition in characterizing a demos in any way circular. As we will see, \nthe notion of democratic organization of a given collection of individuals can be \nunderstood entirely procedurally, without having to settle any prior question of whether \nthat collection meets the conditions for a demos. In the next two subsections we say more \nabout what the capacity for democratic agency means both theoretically and practically.  \nHowever, the general idea should already be clear. By combining an appropriate \ncompositional membership criterion for a demos with our performative condition of \ncapacity for democratic agency, we obtain the following working definition of a demos: \nA \u201cdemos\u201d is a collection of individuals, demarcated by the appropriate \nmembership criterion, which is in principle capable of being organized, in a \ndemocratic manner, in such a way as to function as a state-like group agent. \nBeing a demos under this definition does not imply that the relevant state-like agent \nalready exists or that it will ever come into existence. Nor does it specify how extensive \nsuch a state-like agent could or should plausibly be \u2013 for example, whether it would be a \nfull-blown state or something less encompassing. All it says is that the nature of the \ncollection of individuals itself would be no barrier to the emergence of such a state-like \n 16 \nagent, even if there may still be other barriers. Intuitively, a well-ordered society \u2013 say \nthe population of some stable democratic country \u2013 fulfils the condition of capacity for \ndemocratic agency without difficulty, while the population of a highly divided society in \na situation of intractable civil war does not. Similarly, to give another example, the test \nfor whether or not there exists a European demos (assuming that the European population \nis at least a candidate for a demos on the grounds of affectedness and possibly even \naffectivity) is whether or not the population of Europe can be democratically incorporated \ninto a European state or state-like agent. Commentators are still divided on this question, \nbut it should be uncontentious that the population of Europe is now closer to meeting this \ncondition than it was, for instance, a hundred years ago. \nOf course, the present working definition still leaves a lot of questions open or \nunderspecified \u2013 it is in this sense a definition scheme rather than a fully specified \ndefinition \u2013 but this should be seen as a virtue rather than a vice. Our first aim should be \nto get the big picture right, while still leaving some flexibility with regard to its technical \ndetails, so that disagreements about those details do not undercut that big picture itself. \nAssuming, however, that we have accomplished this first aim, our next step should be to \nzoom in on the relevant details, by trying to clarify what the capacity for democratic \nagency means in theory and what it requires in practice. We now address these questions \nin turn.  \nWhat does the capacity for democratic agency mean in theory? \nAccording to the theory of group agency, a \u201cgroup agent\u201d is a collection of individuals \nwhich meets the conditions of agency, that is, roughly speaking, it has attitudes on the \nissues it faces and acts so as to pursue those attitudes, as defined above. To meet these \nconditions, the collection needs to have in place a certain \u201corganizational structure\u201d, \nwhich can be understood as the totality of rules, procedures and conventions by which the \nindividuals coordinate their decision-making and action-taking.28 In the case of a state, \nthe key group agent for our purposes, the organizational structure consists of the formal \nand informal institutions that underlie the state\u2019s political and economic life. In the case \n                                                 \n28\n List and Pettit, Group Agency (op. cit.). \n 17 \nof a corporation, another familiar group agent, it is given by the relevant corporate \nstructure, its procedures and organizational mechanisms. By contrast, a completely \nunorganized collection of individuals, such as the random collection of people who \nhappen to be in the same subway carriage at a given time, does not usually meet the \nconditions of agency, unless they started organizing themselves in an appropriate way, \nthereby setting up the necessary organizational structure.  \nThe organizational structure of a group agent, particularly that of a state or other state-\nlike entity, may or may not be democratic. It is democratic at least in a minimal sense if it \nsatisfies conditions such as Robert Dahl\u2019s classic conditions of procedural democracy, for \nexample political equality among the individuals organized by the given structure, \neffective opportunities for participation by these individuals, effective opportunities for \ndeveloping an \u201cenlightened understanding\u201d of the relevant issues, for instance through \ncertain forms of deliberation, and control over the relevant agenda of issues to be \ndecided.29 More technically, we might distinguish between more and less democratic \norganizational structures by means of the formal conditions employed in social choice \ntheory.30 Depending on which precise conditions we substitute into our working \ndefinition of a demos, we then obtain stronger or weaker versions of that definition.  \nImportantly, as Dahl himself recognized, one can assess whether a given organizational \nstructure meets such procedural conditions, independently of whether or not the \nunderlying collection of individuals has been demarcated according to appropriate \nnormative criteria. Thus it is entirely meaningful to say, for instance, that within its own \ninstitutional boundaries a given organizational structure counts as democratic, while we \nmay still ask questions about whether those institutional boundaries are legitimate. \nWe have already emphasized that a demos is neither by itself a group agent, nor \nnecessarily part of an actually existing group agent. What, then, do we mean when we say \nthat a demos must be capable of democratic agency? The capacity for democratic agency \n                                                 \n29\n Robert A. Dahl, \u201cProcedural Democracy,\u201d in Philosophy, Politics and Society, 5th series, ed. Peter \nLaslett and James S. Fishkin, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1979). \n30\n E.g., List and Pettit, Group Agency (op. cit.). Axiomatic social choice theory goes back to Kenneth \nArrow, Social Choice and Individual Values (New York: Wiley, 1951\/1963). \n 18 \ncan imply either of two things: Either the collection of individuals is already \ndemocratically organized in such a way as to function as a state-like group agent \u2013 in \nparticular, the resulting democratic state or state-like agent already exists \u2013 or it is \ncapable of becoming so, that is, such a state or state-like agent could be brought into \nexistence if the collection were given the appropriate democratic organizational structure. \nOnly the demoi of well-functioning states or other state-like entities, say those of \nestablished democratic countries, fall into the first category. In the case of any other \ncollection, we need to ask whether, if supplemented with an appropriate democratic \nstructure, the collection would generate a state-like agent.31 \nRoughly speaking, someone or something has the capacity to achieve X just in case there \nis a feasible set of circumstances (a \u201cnearby possible world\u201d, in technical terms), \nattainable from the actual circumstances, in which he, she or it achieves X. Applied to the \npresent context, this means that a collection, say a particular population, which does not \nyet constitute a democratically organized group agent has the capacity of doing so just in \ncase there is a feasible set of circumstances in which this collection is supplemented with \na democratic organizational structure and through it functions as a state-like group agent. \nFor example, since the beginning of European institutional integration, the population of \nthe European Union has arguably moved in the direction of satisfying this condition \u2013 in \nthe sense that the attainment of state-like agency through a democratic structure has \nbecome increasingly realistic \u2013 while any rapidly disintegrating society en route to civil \nwar, such as the society of Yugoslavia in the period of its breakdown, fails to meet it. To \nbe sure, there can be reasonable disagreement as to what criteria of feasibility to employ \nin making such judgments, but those difficulties are no different from the difficulties with \n                                                 \n31\n On the question of whether a democratic institutional structure could emerge at the global level, see \nMathias Koenig-Archibugi, \u201cIs Global Democracy Possible?\u201d, European Journal of International Relations \n(forthcoming). Moreover, the question of whether a given collection under a particular actual or possible \norganizational structure counts as a state-like agent permits a continuum of answers, since state-like agency \nis not a simple on-off phenomenon. There exists a continuum of possible cases ranging from a fully \ndeveloped, well-ordered state at one end (which, in turn, can take a number of different forms) to an \nextreme Hobbesian state of nature at the other end. The kinds of institutions we currently find at the level \nof the European Union, for instance, presumably fall somewhere in the middle. \n 19 \nany other social-scientific use of \u201cmodal\u201d concepts, such as the concepts of possibility, \nfeasibility, avoidability, and so on. \nAfter these theoretical reflections on what the capacity for democratic agency means, we \nnow need to ask what this capacity requires more practically. At this point, the insights \nfrom the existing two variants of the performative approach come into play. \nWhat does the capacity for democratic agency require in practice? \nWe have noted that some groups or collections of individuals exhibit so much internal \ndiscord and disunity that any attempt to organize them democratically so as to achieve \nstate-like agency would be likely to fail, while others are very well suited for this \npurpose. Which characteristics distinguish the one type of group from the other in \npractice? Based on the insights of the two existing variants of the performative approach, \ntwo characteristics stand out. First, for a group to be capable of supporting collective \ndecisions \u2013 one central prerequisite of the capacity for democratic agency \u2013 it must be \npossible to ascribe coherent attitudes to it, which can serve as a basis for these decisions. \nAnd secondly, for a group to be capable of endorsing its collective decisions and taking \nthe required coordinated actions \u2013 another key prerequisite of the capacity for democratic \nagency \u2013 the group must exhibit sufficient internal cohesion, in a sense to be spelt out \nfurther. Let us make both of these practical requirements more explicit, beginning with \nthe first one. \nExternal coherence: It is possible to ascribe to the collection of individuals in \nquestion coherent collective attitudes (particularly, preferences) on the issues on \nwhich collective decisions are needed, where these attitudes are defined by a \nsuitable democratic criterion. \nA paradigmatic example of such a criterion is the majority criterion, as advocated by both \nLocke and Rousseau, who argued, respectively, that \u201cthe act of the majority passes for \nthe act of the whole, and of course determines as having, by the law of Nature and reason, \nthe power of the whole\u201d,32 and \u201cthe vote of the majority always obligates all the rest\u201d.33 A \n                                                 \n32\n John Locke, Two Treatises of Government (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960), bk. 2, ch. \n8.96. \n 20 \nmore systematic defence of the majority criterion might invoke Kenneth May\u2019s classic \ntheorem, which states that when a group seeks to form an attitude on some binary issue \u2013 \nsay, whether to accept or reject some proposition \u2013 the majority criterion uniquely \nsatisfies four very basic and plausible conditions of procedural democracy.34 However, in \nsome contexts, other criteria for the ascription of collective attitudes are conceivable as \nwell. A jury\u2019s attitudes, to give just one example, may be determined by a supermajority \nor unanimity criterion. Thus the appropriate criterion can clearly be group- and context-\nspecific.35 \nTo spell out the second practical requirement for the capacity for democratic agency, \nsome preliminary discussion is needed. It may be tempting to interpret the requirement of \ninternal cohesion as demanding a consensus among all group members on the relevant \nissues. Such a consensus, however, is certainly not necessary for a group to be capable of \nendorsing its collective decisions and taking the required coordinated actions. Groups \nexhibiting less than a full consensus can still succeed on both fronts, and as already \nnoted, many generally recognized demoi exhibit a fair amount of internal pluralism. \nWhile certain destructive kinds of pluralism would be likely to undermine a group\u2019s \n                                                                                                                                                 \n33\n Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract and later political writings, ed.

Second, all individuals have equal weight in determining the collective attitude (\u201canonymity\u201d). \nThird, the criterion itself is unbiased between a positive and a negative attitude (\u201cneutrality\u201d). And fourth, \nthe collective attitude is a positively responsive function of the individual attitudes (\u201cpositive \nresponsiveness\u201d). See Kenneth O. May, \u201cA Set of Independent Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for \nSimple Majority Decision,\u201d Econometrica 20(4) (1952): 680-684; also Robert E.

However, a fully \nadequate analysis of what precise kind of internal cohesion in a group is needed for the \ncapacity for democratic agency would require extensive empirical research, and so the \npresent remarks are very tentative. \nLet us say that a set of individuals \u201cagree substantively\u201d on a particular issue if they hold \nthe same attitudes on it. As we have pointed out, such a strong form of agreement is not \nnecessary for a group\u2019s capacity to endorse its collective decisions and to take the \nrequired actions \u2013 at least it is not necessary once we move beyond certain fundamental \nissues. By contrast, a set of individuals \u201cmeta-agree\u201d on a particular issue if they agree on \nhow to conceptualize that issue within some shared cognitive or normative space, while \nnot necessarily agreeing substantively on it.38 A common conceptualization ensures that \nthe individuals are able to rationalize their conflicting individual attitudes in a common \nway, which in turn enables them to endorse and enact certain compromise decisions that \nmight otherwise be unavailable. The notion of meta-agreement can be made more precise \n                                                 \n36\n E.g., Cass Sunstein, Why Societies Need Dissent (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2003) \nand Scott E.

For \nexample, one might speculate that substantive agreement is needed on (but perhaps only \non) some fundamental matters, such as constitutional ones, and that meta-agreement is \nmore important in the case of preferences than in the case of beliefs. For simplicity, we \nmainly focus on preferences in our present analysis, but this is not meant to reflect any \njudgment about the relative importance of preferences vis-\u00e0-vis beliefs. We can only flag \nthese questions for further research here.  \nAs in the case of our general performative condition for a demos, the fact that the \nrequirements of external coherence and internal cohesion are left somewhat \nunderspecified should be seen as a virtue rather than a vice. It insulates the key ideas \nunderlying our agency-based approach to conceptualizing the demos from disputes about \nits precise operationalization. While it is already a major challenge to sketch out the big \npicture correctly, filling in all the details would require a research programme well \nbeyond the scope of this paper. However, to suggest some starting points, we devote the \nnext section to a first simple operationalization of our approach.   \n                                                 \n39\n As acknowledged in the following discussion, substantive agreement on certain particularly fundamental \nissues may be a necessary condition for the capacity for democratic agency. \n 23 \nIII. A SIMPLE OPERATIONALIZATION \nSo how can we operationalize the requirements of external coherence and internal \ncohesion? How we can we assess the extent to which a collection meets them? In what \nfollows, we propose a first, very simple and tentative operationalization of both \nrequirements in the case of the preferences held by the members of the collection, \ndrawing on ideas from social choice theory.40 Roughly, to obtain a simple proxy measure \nof a collection\u2019s external coherence, we ask whether its majority preferences satisfy \nstandard consistency conditions such as \u201cacyclicity\u201d. And to obtain a similar proxy \nmeasure of the collection\u2019s internal cohesion, we ask whether the individual preferences \nacross the members satisfy certain homogeneity and structure conditions, which can be \ninterpreted as observable indicators of the levels of substantive and meta-agreement on \nthe issues in question. However, we should stress at the outset that the relationship \nbetween the requirements we want to assess and our proposed proxy measures is like that \nbetween a complicated medical condition and a simple diagnostic test. Although the test \nhas a certain degree of sensitivity and specificity for the underlying condition, it is still at \nbest a fallible indicator for it, which can corroborate but not definitively prove the \npresence of the condition. \nOperationalizing external coherence \nIt is helpful to begin with a stylized example. Suppose we want to find out whether the \nworld\u2019s population has a coherent general will on what to do about climate change. For \nsimplicity, suppose that there are three relevant policy options: \n x: All countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n y: Only rich countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n z: No countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nNow it is entirely conceivable that the world\u2019s population falls into three subsets of \nroughly equal size. The members of the first subset, which may include, for example, \n                                                 \n40\n See List, \u201cTwo Concepts of Agreement\u201d (op. cit.); List et al., \u201cDeliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the \nPossibility of Meaningful Democracy\u201d (op. cit.); Richard G. Niemi, \u201cMajority Decision-Making with \nPartial Unidimensionality,\u201d American Political Science Review 63(2) (1969): 488-497. \n 24 \nmany Europeans, prefer x to y to z. The members of the second subset, which may \ninclude some of the world\u2019s poor, prefer y to z to x. The members of the third, which may \ninclude the conservative global warming skeptics, finally, prefer z to x to y. With \nindividual preferences like these, a majority prefers x to y, a majority prefers y to z, and \nyet a majority prefers z to x: an overall \u201ccyclical\u201d, and thereby inconsistent majority \npreference. This is an instance of Condorcet\u2019s much-discussed \u201cparadox\u201d. \nWhen majority preferences are cyclical, they cannot coherently guide decisions. In our \nexample, none of the options would command a majority over all the others \u2013 there is no \n\u201cCondorcet winner\u201d \u2013 and thus the question of what the group wants has no coherent \nanswer here. If the world\u2019s population is as divided in reality as in our simple example, it \nclearly fails to meet the test of external coherence.  \nGenerally, then, we propose to measure external coherence in terms of the absence of \ncyclical majority preferences. For any given set of options and any given combination of \npreferences across individuals, it is a yes-no question whether the resulting majority \npreferences are free from cycles. This would give us a first simple binary test of external \ncoherence. However, when we look at more than one set of issues and perhaps at \nindividual preferences within the same collection of individuals at different times and \nunder different circumstances, we can take the infrequency of cyclical majority \npreferences as a continuous measure of external coherence. It is needless to say that this \nmeasure can \u2013 and ultimately needs to \u2013 be generalized further. \nHow difficult is it for a collection of individuals to achieve external coherence in this \nsense? One influential body of theoretical work suggests that it is extremely difficult. \nAssuming no particular reason why individual preferences should be systematically \nconstrained or correlated, one might expect all possible combinations of individual \npreferences to be equally likely to occur: the so-called \u201cimpartial culture\u201d assumption. \nBut if this is true, the probability of cyclical majority preferences increases as the group \nsize and the number of options increases.41 The larger the collection of individuals and \nthe more complex the issue in question, the less likely it then becomes that the group can \n                                                 \n41\n  William V. Gehrlein, \u201cCondorcet\u2019s Paradox,\u201d Theory and Decision 15(2) (1983): 161-197. \n 25 \nbe externally coherent in the sense defined, and so the prospects for a global demos \nwould be rather slim. William Riker notoriously used similar arguments to attack the \nnotion of a general will per se, that is, even at a national level and not going as far as \nconsidering its possibility beyond state borders.42 \nHowever, the assumption which leads to these bleak predictions \u2013 namely that of an \n\u201cimpartial culture\u201d \u2013 is not only empirically unrealistic, but also constitutes what we may \ncall a \u201cknife-edge\u201d scenario. It is unrealistic because there is no reason to think that, even \nin a collection as diverse as the world\u2019s population, any logically possible combination of \nindividual preferences is as likely to occur as any other. Surely, empirical constraints \nmake some combinations of preferences more likely than others. And even more \nimportantly, an \u201dimpartial culture\u201d constitutes a \u201cknife-edge\u201d scenario because, even for \nthe slightest deviations from it, the probability of cyclical majority preferences can \nalready drop significantly.43 Indeed, there is surprisingly little empirical evidence of \ncycles in real-world preferences, although, as far as we know, the relevant studies never \nconsider preferences at a transnational level.44 \nGiven recent empirical and theoretical work, then, there is some reason to think that the \nthreat of majority cycles is not as serious as it may appear at first sight, at least at the \nlevel of those groups that are candidates for demoi according to standard compositional \ncriteria. But whatever our external coherence measure would say about the world\u2019s \npopulation, we still need to consider our second, and perhaps more challenging \nperformative requirement: internal cohesion.   \n                                                 \n42\n Riker, Liberalism Against Populism (op. cit.). \n43\n Andranik S.

This can be nicely illustrated by a slight modification of our \nexample of preferences over policies to address global warming. Suppose, as before, that \nthe world\u2019s population is subdivided into three groups who prefer, respectively, x to y to \nz, y to z to x, and z to x to y. This time, however, suppose, that, as a result of differential \npopulation growth, one of the three groups, say the second one, has become an absolute \nmajority, consisting of more than half of the world\u2019s population. Unlike before, the \nmajority preferences are then consistent, since they now coincide with the preferences of \nthe enlarged subgroup. Qualitatively, however, nothing has changed in the structure of \npluralism across the three groups. Intuitively, the world\u2019s public opinion is as divided as \nit was before, even though the relative group sizes have slightly changed. Achieving \ncoordinated action may be no easier than it was before. What this shows is that the \nexistence of consistent majority preferences alone is not enough to tell us whether the \ngroup is internally cohesive in any meaningful sense. \nWe have suggested that internal cohesion can be conceptualized in terms of substantive \nand\/or meta-agreement on the relevant issues. How can we operationalize these notions? \nAs defined above and now applied to the case of preferences, a set of individuals agree \nsubstantively on a particular issue if they hold the same preferences on it. Formally, we \ncan measure the substantive agreement within a group by quantifying the diversity among \nits members\u2019 preferences on the relevant issue. We can employ, for instance, a suitable \nmeasure of fragmentation to quantify how much heterogeneity there is in individual first-\nchoice preferences.45 The lower its value, the higher is the level of substantive agreement \nin a group. \n                                                 \n45\n One such measure is the \u201cLaakso-Taagepera index of fragmentation\u201d. Suppose n1 (among n) individuals \nmost prefer the first alternative (among k alternatives), n2 most prefer the second, \u2026, nk most prefer the k-\nth. Then the \u201cLaakso-Taagepera index\u201d can be defined as  \n.)\/(...)\/()\/(\n1\n22\n2\n2\n1 nnnnnn\nLT\nk+++\n=  \n 27 \nBut substantive agreement is neither necessary for consistent majority preferences, nor is \nit generally needed for achieving compromise decisions and coordinated actions, at least \nnot once we move beyond certain fundamental issues. Perhaps a shared commitment to \ncertain fundamental rights and duties \u2013 and thus a substantive agreement on some \nparticularly fundamental matters \u2013 is required for the capacity for democratic agency. But \nwhen we set those fundamental matters aside, many generally recognized demoi exhibit \nonly very limited substantive agreement. What appears to be a more plausible \nrequirement of cohesion in a demos \u2013 over and above the mentioned \u201cthin\u201d substantive \nagreement \u2013 is a suitable meta-agreement. Recall that a set of individuals meta-agree on a \nparticular issue if they agree on how to conceptualize that issue within some shared \ncognitive or normative space. In the case of preferences, we can measure the meta-\nagreement in a group by quantifying the degree to which its members\u2019 preferences satisfy \na structure condition that reflects such a common conceptualization.  \nThe best-known such structure condition is Duncan Black\u2019s notion of single-peakedness, \nthough it is not the only one in the literature and we here focus on it just for simplicity \n(for a refined version of the present analysis, more sophisticated conditions may \nultimately be needed).46 Black\u2019s condition considers not whether the individuals \nsubstantively agree on the given options, but whether their preferences are rationalizable \nin terms of the same underlying \u201cleft-right\u201d dimension. Crucially, the terms \u201cleft\u201d and \n\u201cright\u201d can have any meaning, such as \u201curban\u201d and \u201crural\u201d, \u201csecular\u201d and \u201creligious\u201d, \n\u201cpro-redistribution\u201d and \u201ccontra redistribution\u201d, and so on. A combination of preferences \nacross a group of individuals is called \u201csingle-peaked\u201d if the options can be aligned from \n                                                                                                                                                 \nIn particular, LT = 1 means perfect consensus; LT \u2192 \u221e means extreme fragmentation.

It not only formalizes the idea that individual preferences are rationalizable in \nterms of a shared cognitive or normative dimension, thereby capturing the notion of a \nmeta-agreement among the individuals, but it is also sufficient for consistent majority \npreferences. Black famously proved that whenever preferences across a collection of \nindividuals are single-peaked, the resulting majority preferences are free from any cycles, \nand furthermore, the option that is majority-preferred to (or at least tied with) every other \noption lies at the \u201cpeak\u201d of the median individual on the relevant left-right dimension. \nSingle-peakedness therefore entails the satisfaction of our requirement of external \ncoherence and ensures that whatever option is most preferred by the majority can be \njustified as a \u201ccompromise\u201d by virtue of occupying a median position on a shared \ncognitive or normative dimension. \nSo far, we have defined single-peakedness as a binary notion: Either the preferences \nacross a group are single-peaked or they are not.47 More generally, we would like to \nmeasure single-peakedness in a continuous manner. We can do so by calculating the \ngroup\u2019s \u201cproximity to single-peakedness\u201d, defined as the size of the largest subgroup \nwithin which preferences are single-peaked, divided by the overall group size.48 A value \nof one would correspond to full single-peakedness and thus a high level of meta-\nagreement in the group; a value close to zero would correspond to the opposite case \nwhere the group is far removed from meta-agreement.  \n                                                 \n47\n In the stylized example of the world population subdivided into three groups, the condition is violated: \nNo matter how we align the three options from left to right, one of the three groups will fail to have \npreferences that fit the pattern of single-peakedness. If, on the other hand, one of the groups were to change \ntheir views, transforming their preferences into those of one of the other groups, or even into the exact \nreverse of those preferences, the violation of single-peakedness would disappear. \n48\n List et al., \u201cDeliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u201d (op. cit.); \nNiemi, \u201cMajority Decision-Making with Partial Unidimensionality\u201d (op. cit.). \n 29 \nThis simple measure not only captures an important aspect of a group\u2019s internal cohesion, \nnamely its level of meta-agreement (in a simple, one-dimensional sense), but it is also \nrelevant to the group\u2019s performance with regard to external coherence: the higher a \ngroup\u2019s proximity to single-peakedness, the lower the probability of cyclical majority \npreferences. In the limiting case of a value of one, external coherence is fully guaranteed. \nInterestingly, Riker himself, despite his criticism of a populist conception of democracy, \nrecognized the potential that a common conceptualization of an issue has in producing a \ncoherent general will. Even more interestingly, he related the possibility of such a \ncommon conceptualization to conditions usually associated with the presence of a demos: \n\u201cIf, by reason of discussion, debate, civic education, and political socialization, \nvoters have a common view of the political dimension (as evidenced by single-\npeakedness), then a transitive outcome is guaranteed.\u201d49 \nThese remarks not only support the idea that proximity to single-peakedness (together \nwith a suitable index of a group\u2019s substantive agreement on relevant fundamental \nmatters) might be a good proxy measure for assessing a group\u2019s internal cohesion and \nthat such cohesion could be indicative of a demos, but they also point to a possible role \nthat deliberation \u2013 \u201cdiscussion, debate, civic education and political socialization\u201d \u2013 \ncould play in promoting such cohesion. We explore these ideas further in the next \nsection. Before doing so, however, it is important to emphasize, once again, that our \nproposed simple operationalization of external coherence and internal cohesion is \nanalytically distinct from our general agency-based approach to conceptualizing the \ndemos, or from the idea that the capacity for democratic agency requires some form of \nexternal coherence and internal cohesion. While majority acyclicity and proximity to \nsingle-peakedness are particularly simple proxy measures of external coherence and \ninternal cohesion in the case of preferences \u2013 a bit like a simple diagnostic test for a \ncomplex condition \u2013 other, more sophisticated measures may undoubtedly need to be \ndeveloped for many contexts.  \n                                                 \n49\n Riker, Liberalism Against Populism (op. cit.), p. 128. \n 30 \nIV. TOWARDS A GLOBAL DEMOS \nWith our conceptual apparatus in place, we can return to our original question of whether \nthere can be a global demos. A comprehensive answer to this question is beyond the \nscope of this paper, but we can now see much more clearly what such an answer would \nrequire. We would need to determine, first, to what extent the world\u2019s population already \nhas a capacity for democratic agency, operationalized in terms of internal coherence and \nexternal cohesion, and secondly, which forces and mechanisms could move it in that \ndirection, as a result of either intentional policies or unintentional developments. Given \nthe enormity of this task, we limit ourselves to illustrating the implications of our \napproach in one particular policy area in relation to which the world\u2019s population is, at \nleast prima facie, a candidate for a demos \u2013 on affectedness and perhaps also affectivity \ngrounds. The issue is the creation of a permanent judicial institution capable of \nprosecuting and punishing individuals who have committed genocide, war crimes, and \ncrimes against humanity. Our brief analysis of the creation of the International Criminal \nCourt (ICC) in the 1990s will suggest, first, that the external coherence and internal \ncohesion of the \u201cinternational community\u201d on this issue displayed a marked increase and, \nsecond, that this increase was due at least in part to processes of deliberation across state \nboundaries. This latter point is particularly important for the question of how a global \ndemos might be promoted. It has been suggested that deliberation can help overcome \ndifficulties such as majority cycles,50 and empirical evidence from domestic contexts, \nsuch as local and national Deliberative Polls, is consistent with this claim.51 But more \n                                                 \n50\n Miller, \u201cDeliberative Democracy and Social Choice\u201d (op. cit.); Knight and Johnson, \u201cAggregation and \nDeliberation\u201d (op. cit.); Dryzek and List, \u201cSocial Choice Theory and Deliberative Democracy\u201d (op. cit.); \nList, \u201cDeliberation and Agreement\u201d (op. cit.). \n51\n Specifically, the deliberation appears to move individual preferences away from combinations leading to \ncycles, by increasing proximity to single-peakedness, as empirically investigated in List et al., \n\u201cDeliberation, Single-Peakedness, and the Possibility of Meaningful Democracy\u201d (op. cit.). Deliberative \nPolls have also shown that deliberative exercises may have a negative, neutral or positive effect on \nsubstantive agreement. E.g., R. A. Eggins, K. J. Reynolds, P. J. Oakes and K. I. Mavor, \u201cCitizen \nparticipation in a deliberative poll: Factors predicting attitude change and political engagement,\u201d Australian \nJournal of Psychology 59(2) (2007): 94-100; V. N. Andersen and K. M. Hansen, \u201cHow deliberation makes \nbetter citizens: The Danish Deliberative Poll on the euro,\u201d European Journal of Political Research 46(4) \n 31 \nresearch is needed to ascertain if the same effect can result from transnational \ndeliberation, where the Habermasian shared life-world is much thinner. Our discussion is \nmeant to be a tentative and illustrative step in that direction.  \nProbably only a small part of the world\u2019s population is or will ever be a direct victim of \ngenocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, but in this area Kant\u2019s dictum that \n\u201cthe growing prevalence of a (narrower or wider) community among the peoples of the \nearth has now reached a point at which the violation of right at one place on the earth is \nfelt in all places\u201d appears particularly compelling.52 For instance, a 2007 poll of twelve \ncountries in different parts of the world found that in all these countries a majority agreed \nthat the UN Security Council should have the right to authorize the use of military force \nto prevent severe human rights violations such as genocide.53 Apart from assuming a \nwide substantive agreement against doing nothing in the face of atrocities, however, it is \ndifficult if not impossible to determine whether the attitudes of the world\u2019s population on \nthis issue \u2013 specifically on how perpetrators should be prosecuted and potential \nperpetrators deterred \u2013 are sufficiently coherent and cohesive to meet the performative \ncriterion for a global demos. Obviously there has been no global referendum, but neither \nhas the question been explored in any depth by transnational opinion polls such as the \nWorld Values Survey or the Pew Global Attitudes Project.54  For this reason, and for the \nsake of argument, we will assume that the positions taken by national governments are \nreasonable proxies of the attitudes of their populations. This assumption may be true in \nsome cases but, of course, it is questionable in others.

The post-cold-war years saw a renewed impetus on the issue, and in 1991 the UN \nGeneral Assembly asked the International Law Commission to draft an international \ncriminal court treaty. Formal discussions among UN member states took place in two \nsessions of an ad-hoc committee in 1995, six sessions of a preparatory committee \nbetween 1996 and 1998, and a diplomatic conference held in Rome in June and July \n1998. The meetings and the diplomatic conference addressed a wide and complex set of \nlegal and political questions, but on the key issues three main positions were taken by the \nparticipating states, as discussed by Fen Osler Hampson and Holly Reid.55 The coalition \nsemi-officially known as the Like-Minded group (LM) wanted a strong and independent \ncourt, which would be able to prosecute individuals without requiring the specific \nconsent of the affected states or the UN Security Council (let us call this option Strong). \nThe group of governments that Hampson and Reid refer to as the \u201cconservative states\u201d \n(CS) were concerned that an international criminal court would merely be yet another \ntool available to the great powers to encroach upon the sovereignty of weaker states, and \nthus preferred a weak court, or no court at all (we call this option Weak). A third group of \ngovernments, which Hampson and Reid call the \u201crestrictive states\u201d (RS), wanted to make \nthe court subordinate to the UN Security Council and reserve to the latter the authority to \ntrigger as well as to block the court\u2019s action (call this option Subordinate). Although the \nstatements made by state representatives in the forums in which the court was negotiated \nusually only pointed to the most preferred option, the ranking of the other options can be \ninferred with a reasonable degree of confidence from the arguments presented by those \nrepresentatives and general considerations.56 The LM group would have preferred a court \n                                                 \n55\n Fen Osler Hampson and Holly Reid, \u201cCoalition Diversity and Normative Legitimacy in Human Security \nNegotiations,\u201d International Negotiation 8(1) (2003): 7-42. \n56\n Fanny Benedetti and John L.

Since a key concern \nof the CS was the possibility that the court could be manipulated by the great powers, \nthey would have preferred a strong but independent court to a court that was essentially a \ntool of the Security Council. Finally, the RS would have preferred a weak court to a \nstrong independent court, as the latter may have acted against their core interests, for \ninstance by indicting their military personnel involved in peacekeeping or other foreign \nmissions.  \nThus, when the \u201cinternational community\u201d started negotiating on the creation of an \ninternational criminal court, it displayed a low level of external coherence and internal \ncohesion. Not only were there major substantive differences over the court\u2019s jurisdiction \nand independence, but the way the states\u2019 preferences were distributed over the three \nmain options reflected low levels of meta-agreement. In these conditions, negotiating a \ncompromise solution was difficult and, even if the governments had resorted to voting at \nan early stage, it may well be that every main option would have been defeated.57   \nHowever, when a vote on the final draft of the Statute of the International Criminal Court \nwas called on 18 July 1998, 120 governments voted for the Statute, 7 voted against, and \n21 abstained. The Statute created a strong court, which is closer to the preferences of the \nLM coalition than to the positions voiced by other states. What led to this outcome? First, \n                                                                                                                                                 \nThird and Fourth Sessions of the UN Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International \nCriminal Court,\u201d American Journal of International Law 92(1) (1998):124-133; \u201cThe Fifth Session of the \nUN Preparatory Committee on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court,\u201d American Journal of \nInternational Law 92(2) (1998): 331-339; \u201cThe Sixth Session of the UN Preparatory Committee on the \nEstablishment of an International Criminal Court,\u201d American Journal of International Law 92(3) (1998): \n548-556; Roy S. Lee, The International Criminal Court: the making of the Rome Statute (The Hague: \nKluwer Law International, 1999). \n57\n For instance, if we consider the positions voiced at the beginning of the negotiation process, a \nhypothetical vote by simple majority rule on pairs of alternatives and on the basis of the \u201cone state, one \nvote\u201d principle might have produced a majority cycle, as the sum of LM and CS votes could have ensured a \nmajority for Strong against Subordinate, the sum of LM and RS votes could have ensured a majority for \nSubordinate against Weak, and the sum of CS and RS votes could have ensured a majority for Weak against \nStrong.  \n 34 \nthe conference chair was able to exercise a degree of agenda-setting power and propose a \ncomprehensive package. Second, this package incorporated a few concessions to \ndelegations that remained concerned about a strong and independent court and requested \nsome safeguards. But arguably the main reason for the large majority supporting the \nStatute was the fact that over the years the LM position had gained many supporters, \nwhile the CS and RS positions had not. The majority of states that had not participated or \nclearly positioned themselves during the preparatory meetings came to support positions \nclose to those of the original LM group.  \nA number of scholars who examined the negotiation process emphasize the key role of \ndeliberation in increasing support for the LM position.58 The LM group made little or no \nuse of bargaining tactics such as promising rewards for support or threatening sanctions \nagainst opponents. On the other hand, pro-court officials, scholars and activists had \nrepeatedly sought opportunities for open and trust-promoting dialogues with other \ndelegates. Extensive deliberation also took place among officials of pre-existing and \nwell-tested groupings, such as NATO, and in regional conferences organized by LM \nstates and involving other governments in regions such as southern Africa, western \nAfrica and central and eastern Europe.59 Particularly notable was the contribution of non-\nstate groups to the promotion of deliberation among state representatives. Members of \nseveral human rights NGOs, foundations, and professional associations participated in \nconferences, workshops and other events with government officials. NGO representatives \nwere often legal experts who could provide authoritative views on various aspects of \ninternational criminal law. In 1995 the World Federalist Movement promoted a Coalition \nfor an International Criminal Court, which grew rapidly to encompass over 800 \norganizations by the start of the Rome conference in June 1998. Most of the 237 NGOs \nofficially accredited at the Rome conference belonged to that Coalition. In addition to \nexercising pressure and increasing transparency, NGOs had a major role in shaping the \n                                                 \n58\n Nicole Deitelhoff, \u00dcberzeugung in der Politik.

The existence of an effective international regime capable of deterring \ngenocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, and of prosecuting alleged \nperpetrators even at a cost to national sovereignty, is arguably something that affects \nmost people in the world. Worldwide abhorrence of such crimes may even be sufficient \nto stimulate global bonds of solidarity on that issue. The application of compositional \ncriteria \u2013 almost certainly the criterion of affectedness but perhaps even that of affectivity \n\u2013 is very likely to identify the entire world population as the relevant candidate for a \ndemos for the decision to establish a global legal regime against atrocities. However, if \nwe take the governments\u2019 positions as a proxy of citizen attitudes (an admittedly very \nimperfect indicator), it is doubtful whether the world\u2019s population as a whole met our \nperformative criterion for a demos when the creation of the Court was placed on the \ninternational agenda in the early 1990s. External coherence and internal cohesion, as \ndefined earlier in this paper, were low globally in relation to this issue. But, crucially, this \nwas not an inescapable situation. Not only did positions change, producing higher levels \nof external coherence and internal cohesion; this change was at least in part the result of a \nprocess of deliberation that was consciously promoted and stimulated. The United \nNations provided a broad institutional framework that facilitated repeated communication \nand interaction, and this forum was supplemented by the activities of a large number of \ngovernment officials, international civil servants, experts, and NGO representatives who \ncreated and used many opportunities for formal and informal, open and closed \ndeliberation. The performative dimension of the international community was thus \nenhanced by design. Extrapolating from this illustrative case, a global demos, in the \nagency-based sense introduced in this paper, no longer seems completely unattainable, at \nleast when it comes to certain issues of global concern such as the present one. \n 36 \nV. CONCLUDING REMARKS \nTo recapitulate our argument, we have suggested that a good account of the demos must \nanswer two questions. It must tell us, first, which collection(s) of individuals can be \nconsidered as candidate(s) for a demos for a given set of issues, and second, what \nfunctional characteristics such a collection must exhibit in order to facilitate good \ngovernance on those issues, that is, to guide collective decisions and to enable \ncoordinated actions. Since there are good off-the-shelf proposals on how to answer the \nfirst, compositional question, we have concentrated on the second, performative one and \nproposed an agency-based approach to it. The central idea is that, to function as a demos, \na collection of individuals must have the capacity to be organized democratically in such \na way as to function as a state-like group agent. Metaphorically speaking, the collection \nmust be \u201cfit\u201d, under the right democratic organization, either for statehood or at least for \nsome restricted variant of it, even if it has not yet achieved that status. We have suggested \nthat having such a capacity requires the collection to exhibit sufficient external coherence \n\u2013 in the sense that consistent collective attitudes can be ascribed to it \u2013 and internal \ncohesion \u2013 in the sense that its level of internal diversity does not prevent successful \ncollective decisions and coordinated actions. However, we have tried to insulate this big \npicture from disputes about its operationalization by leaving many of its details open, \nproposing only a first simple and tentative operationalization in the case of preferences. \nNonetheless, our approach should make the question of whether there can be a global \ndemos tractable by clarifying what an answer to this question requires, both conceptually \nand empirically. As an empirical illustration, we have finally looked at one particular \npolicy issue \u2013 the creation of the International Criminal Court \u2013 to suggest that the \nsatisfaction of the identified conditions for a global demos is not completely out of reach \nand that it can be actively promoted through certain forms of transnational deliberation. \nOur case study is as modest, however, as our theoretical claims are ambitious, and we \nhope that this paper provides some useful conceptual resources for more comprehensive \nresearch. \n \n"}
