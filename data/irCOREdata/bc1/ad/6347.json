Barker and F. Manji, Writing for Change - An\nInteractive Guide to Effective Writing, Writing\nfor Science, Writing for Advocacy, CD-ROM and\nUsers Guide, Fahama\/International Development\nResearch Centre, Oxford, 2000. ISBN: 0-9536-\n9021-0, no price given. Softback (28 pages) and\nCD-ROM.\nThis is not a book; the package consists of a\nCD-ROM and a users' guide.\nThe user guide consists of a 28-page A5 format\nbrochure. It gives an overview (4 pages) of the\ncontents of the CD-Rom and how it can assist in\nthe writing process in three main sections: core\nskills, writing for science and writing for\nadvocacy. Within each of these subsections more\ndetail is provided, with the authors giving a\nshort introductory aim for each task and the\nexpected outcomes.\nThere then follows a page of instructions on how\nto run the CD-ROM with details of how to open\nthe accompanying 'notebook' for making notes\nand observations.\nThe next six pages suggest that the package can\nbe used in four main ways: as a resource for self-\nmanaged learning; as a resource for group-based\nlearning; as a reference tool to help when you\nneed it; and as a framework for running a train-\ning workshop or programme.\nThe remainder of the booklet outlines how to\nincorporate the package into a training workshop\n(eight pages) and provide information about the\nsponsors and publishers of the package.\nThe CD-ROM can be entered using the guidance\ngiven in the booklet. It is clearly labelled and laid\nout to show a complete overview of all the\nmenus and sub-menus available.\nWhen entering the menus and their sub-menus\nmost of the information is provided as straight\ntext, with the occasional suggestion that the\n'notebook' feature be activated to allow the user\nto practise writing a statement.\nI was unable to find any part of the CD-ROM\nthat I would consider interactive. Interactive\nmeans that the programme and the user 'talk' to\neach other, or provide a dialogue which is in\nresponse to something one does and the other\nadds to or modifies or comments on. In this\nsense this package cannot claim to be interactive,\nas this does not occur.\nAs this aspect was disappointing, the CD-ROM\ninformation would have been more effectively\ndelivered by using a large workbook with gapped\nareas and an index with suggestions and possible\nanswers to problems. It would also be portable\nand of use wherever the leaner chose to study.\nI would not recommend the use of this package\nto any of my students who wish to improve their\nwriting skills. This type of product is desperately\nneeded and I am disappointed that the package\ntitle seemed to have addressed the need, only to\nfind the contents did not live up to these claims.\nAnne Brown\nHeriot Watt University\n83\nReviews\nPaul Z. Jackson, 58 1\/2 Ways to Improve in\nTraining, Gower, Aldershot, 2000. ISBN 0-566-\n08313-2. Hardback, xviii + 135 pages, \u00a349.50.\nHave you ever felt that you needed an injection of\nbright ideas for ice-breakers, activities to get your\nworkshop off to the right start, ideas to turn a\ndifficult group of people into a team or just a\nchange from your usual activities? Well Paul\nJackson's book might well solve your problems.\nThis is a book with 58'\/2 different ideas on how\nto energize the group creating so-called 'Impro\nEnergy' - a current which runs between\nparticipants. The activities are described in a way\nwhich allows\/encourages modification or tweak-\ning to suit your particular situation or objective.\nThis is a book for your bookshelf to be dipped\ninto regularly.\nThe structure and guidance given are clear. The\nactivities are grouped according to their\ntype\/objective, for example, 'emotions and\nattitudes; scenarios'. The introduction shows\nwhere each of the activities fits into a 'visual,\nverbal and physical triangle' to enable you to\nchoose from the activities which most closely\naddress your objectives. In addition, there is a\n'key' for each activity which explains in a quick\nvisual representation how each activity is rated\nusing the following criteria:\nParticipants - range of numbers of people\nwho can be engaged.\nTime - in minutes (I suspect the minimum of\ntime required).\nEnergy - amount of physical exertion needed\nby participants (scale of 0-5).\nIndividual\/team - is there more personal or\ngroup benefit (scale of 0-5).\nVisual\/verbal\/physical - each of these\ncharacteristics gets a rating from 0 to 5.\nFurther guidance is given on how to make the\nactivity work by giving very explicit instructions.\nThis means that even the novice trainer can\nmake very positive use of the book, but the more\nexperienced trainer can adapt and adopt at will.\nThe information supplied for each activity\ncovers:\n'The trainer says' - this can be used verbatim\nif required.\n'Bell' - to prompt an end or change of activity.\n'Side-coach' - encouragement or further\ninstructions required.\n84\n'Debrief - questions to prompt reflection.\n'Variations' - suggestions and developments.\n'Equipment' - anything needed, although\nmost activities do not require props.\nHaving assimilated the guidelines and the way\nthe book is presented, it is then a case of leafing\nthrough for general inspiration or going to the\nsection which contains the activities most\nrelevant to your objective. The benefit of this\nbook is the way in which the physical activity is\nrelated to the learning opportunities it generates.\nThese paragraphs should encourage the trainer\nto use the activities to enhance their training\nsessions.\nEach section contains about seven or eight\nseparate activities. The instructions and informa-\ntion relating to each activity never exceed two\npages and often take less than one page. Each\nactivity is introduced with a paragraph\ndescribing its essence and its expected outcomes.\nThe instructions are followed by the 'debrief\nsection in which there are prompts to help the\ntrainer get the participants to reflect on the\nactivity and explore the feelings, opportunities\nor thoughts it has generated. Sometimes, on the\nother hand, the debrief prompts a discussion\naround the activity and the objectives of the\nworkshop, meeting or training event.\nSection 1 aims to 'Alert and Energize' between 2\nand 100 people in about five minutes. The names\nof the individual activities conjure up lovely\nscenes: 'Shark Island', 'Target Bluff and 'Ping\nPong'. They are all fast moving activities in a\nverbal or physical sense and should leave the\ngroup alert and ready to receive the training.\nSection 2 entitled \"Working Together' obviously\ncontains team-oriented activities. Participants'\ngroup sizes vary from 6-100 to 2-13 and length\nof time needed from 5 to 60 minutes. The hour-\nlong activity 'Team Pix' is about how a group\nsees itself working together. The options for\nindividual variation are clear, as are the range of\ntimes when such an activity would be\nappropriate. Other activities have purposes such\nas 'exploring and extending levels of energy,\ncreativity and trust' and 'a physical warm-up'.\n'Influencing Relationships' is the overarching\npurpose of activities in Section 3. A range of\nindividual to team-based activities, include some\nvisual, some verbal and some physical. A group\nof three related activities, 'Silent Focus', 'Noisy\nFocus' and 'Focus Complete', examine the\nAlt-J Volume 10 Number 2\nconcept of give and take and may be appropriate\nwhen embarking on a workshop\/training session\nwhich may involve these sentiments. Again\nactivities can engage from 4 to 100 participants\nfrom 5 to 25 minutes.\nSection 4 on 'Resources' interprets this term\nquite widely - from things in your pocket, to\nyourself, your achievements, shared abilities and\ninhibitions. The activities require participants to\nengage and thereby reveal information about\nthemselves. These activities tend to be visual or\nverbal rather than physical and can involve\n2-100 participants for between 5 and 40 minutes.\nActivities surrounding 'Emotions and Attitudes'\n(Section 5) cover team and individual strengths,\nbut again are largely visual or .verbal. They\nengage 3-100 participants for 5-60 minutes. The\nactivities seek to raise individuals' awareness of,\nand reaction to, their emotions. One of the\ngames, 'Intensity Statements', explores the\nimpact of expressing everyday statements at\nvariable levels of intensity. These activities have\ntheir own special opportunities for use where the\ngroup and the facilitator are likely to feel happy\nwith this type of activity. The 'Appreciation\nChain' activity should please most staff\ndevelopers as it encourages positive feedback to\nall participants individually.\nSection 6 is entitled 'Improvisation Activities'.\nRanging from 20 to 40 minutes' duration for\n3-90 participants, these encourage team creation\nand development and require participants to\nexplore their feelings after completing the\nactivity. This chapter brings to mind the TV\nprogramme of improvisation called Whose Line\nis it Anyway?, which always leaves me feeling\nexhausted at the participants' energy and\nenthusiasm levels.\nSection 7 is about 'creativity' and develops in\ncomplexity from Section 6. Creativity can have\nvisual, verbal or physical focus. Some of the\nactivities are quite brief (10 minutes) while\nothers last as long as 50 minutes and again the\nnumbers of participants can range from 2 to 60.\nAudience participation plays a part in several of\nthese activities, allowing the benefits of the\nexercise to be looked at from different angles.\nThe activities range from 'making a badge to\nrepresent...' through to writing and performing\nsixteen-line plays.\nThe last full chapter is group activities under the\nheading 'Wisdom'. Have we reached this\ninformed stage by working our way through the\nbook? From 1 to 100 participants can take from\n10 minutes to 50 minutes to do the activities\nwhich focus on learning from previous\nexperience, either pre-workshop, from the\nworkshop or from the activity itself. Can you\nimagine what you might learn from getting a\ngroup to count from 1 to 20 with only one\nperson speaking at a time and always going back\nto the beginning if two people speak\nsimultaneously? Learning from these activities is\nboth individually and team-focused.\nThis is a book that needs to be put into practice to\ntest its credibility. However, the way it is set out,\nthe clear indication of what you might expect to\ngain from an activity, how many people you can\nengage for how long and with what level of\nphysical or mental activity means that it is down\nto you as the trainer\/facilitator to make it work. It\nseems that anyone can give the instructions but\nthe skill is in choosing the right activity for your\nsituation and using the debrief in a constructive\nway. The combination of the trainer personality\nand the group characteristics coupled with time\navailable and numbers of participants will rule\nout some activities for each occasion but the\nrecipe book is on the shelf, inviting readers to\nfollow word for word or providing inspiration.\nImprovisation is the name of Jackson's game so\nyou need to be open to the excitement this offers.\nThis book certainly makes me want to get out\nthere to try some of these activities.\nThe 'A is a 'shameless plug' for another of\nJackson's books which he claims will allow you\nto run effective training sessions from planning\nto debrief - reading for another day.\nAlison Holmes\nThe Open University\n85\n"}
