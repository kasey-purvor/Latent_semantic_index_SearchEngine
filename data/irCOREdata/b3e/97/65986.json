A total of 261 infants in North Tees were followed up\nat 1 and 3 months of age, as were 1095 infants aged 1 week to 1 year from five English health regions.\nResults: Data from both studies found that almost half of all neonates bed-shared at some time with their\nparents (local = 47%, 95% CI 41 to 54; national = 46%, 95% CI 34 to 58), and on any one night in the first\nmonth over a quarter of parents slept with their baby (local = 27%, 95% CI 22 to 33; national = 30%, 95%\nCI 20 to 42). Bed-sharing was not related to younger mothers, single mothers, or larger families, and was\nnot more common in the colder months, at weekends, or among the more socially deprived families; in fact\nbed-sharing was more common among the least deprived in the first months of life. Breast feeding was\nstrongly associated with bed-sharing, both at birth and at 3 months. Bed-sharing prevalence was uniform\nwith infant age from 3 to 12 months; on any one night over a fifth of parents (national = 21%, 95% CI 18 to\n24) slept with their infants.\nConclusion: Bed-sharing is a relatively common practice in England, not specific to class, but strongly\nrelated to breast feeding.\nA\nlthough physical contact between parents and infants\nduring sleep is culturally widespread,1 the debate about\nparent\u2013infant bed-sharing in Western societies has\npolarised around benefits of prolonged contact, and concern\nthat this environment may introduce risks to infants.2\u20133 Some\nargue that all parent\u2013infant bed-sharing should be banned to\nprevent the proportionately small number of infant deaths\nthat occur in adult beds;2 however others caution against\nthrowing the baby out with the bathwater,4\u20135 and that\nrecommendations about bed-sharing cannot be made with-\nout empirical data based on further research.6\u20138\nBed-sharing was initially implicated as a risk factor for\nsudden infant death syndrome (SIDS);9 however it subse-\nquently became clear that smoking and alcohol were\nconfounding variables.10 Furthermore in populations where\nbed-sharing is normative practice, but other risk factors are\nabsent, cot death rates are unusually low.11\u201313\nAs very little data exist on bed-sharing prevalence in\nWestern industrial societies, this paper reports such data\nfrom England. Using a precise definition of bed-sharing we\ncompare two data sets to examine characteristics of this\npractice over time; a local two year longitudinal study of\nnight-time infant care practices in northeast England and, as\npart of the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths & Deaths in\nInfancy (CESDI), a national cross-sectional case-control\nstudy into the causes of SIDS which included control data\non bed-sharing on a particular night.\nMETHODS\nCentred on the Borough of Stockton-on-Tees, the North Tees\nNight-time Parenting Study examined normal night-time\nparenting of families with young infants. The total popula-\ntion was 178 000 (mid-2000), with 2097 live births per year\n(1998). Thirty per cent of households were classified \u2018\u2018low\nincome\u2019\u2019 (1998), with Stockton ranking 49th most deprived\nborough of 353 in the UK index of Local Deprivation.14\nUsing sleep logs and interviews we obtained information\non night-time care-giving for a broadly representative sample\nof 261 families with a newborn infant.15 Two families had\ntwins and we use data here from the firstborn only.\nParticipants completed structured diaries (sleep logs) regard-\ning night-time parenting for one week during the infant\u2019s\nfirst and third months of life.\nCESDI was a three year (February 1993 to March 1996)\npopulation based case-control study encompassing five\nformer health regions (South West, Trent, Yorkshire,\nNorthern, and Wessex). The population was 17.7 million,\nwith 473 000 live-births within these regions during the\nstudy. Data were obtained by parental interviews for all SIDS\ndeaths and four surviving control infants. The age matched\ncontrols were randomly chosen from the caseload of the\nhealth visitor of the index infant. As previously reported,16\n92.5% of the control families approached were used for this\nstudy; a comparison of maternal occupation with GB census\ndata from 1991 suggested that this sample was broadly\nrepresentative of the larger maternal population. A period of\nsleep (the \u2018\u2018reference sleep\u2019\u2019) was identified 24 hours before\nthe control interview corresponding to the time of day during\nwhich the index baby had died. Any details of the infant\nsleep were therefore not subject to more than 24 hours recall\nbias. Details of night-time sleeps were recorded for 1095 of\nthe 1300 controls. These infants were used to look at the age\ndistribution of bed-sharing from birth to 12 months;\nsubgroups of these infants (63 aged less than a month and\n176 infants 3\u20134 months of age) were used to look at other\naspects of bed-sharing. Seven control families had twins;\nagain data were used from the firstborn only.\nDifferences in proportions have been tested with the x2 test\nusing Yates\u2019s correction; Fisher\u2019s exact test has been used\nwhen any cell had an expected value ,5. All tests were two\ntailed with a 5% degree of significance. Non-normal\ndistributions have been described using medians and inter-\nquartile ranges (IQR). Confidence intervals for single\nproportions were based on the Wilson method.17\nBed-sharing was defined by taking a specific night and\ncalculating the proportion of infants who slept with an adult\n1106\nwww.archdischild.com\n on 5 November 2009 adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nfor at least part of the sleep. For the local study this meant\nrandomly choosing a night from the sleep log; for the\nnational study this meant using the information collected for\nthe \u2018\u2018reference sleep\u2019\u2019 in the previous 24 hours. Usual practice\nwas recorded, but a scale of response was taken rather than a\ndichotomy; measuring the time spent in the parental bed\nover an average week was used by the local study, while\nobtaining responses from \u2018\u2018never\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2018always bed-sharing\u2019\u2019\nfrom the parents was the method used by the national study.\nBecause of the cross-sectional nature of the national study,\ndata on usual practice were only obtained for infants aged up\nto 1 month; otherwise it was difficult to distinguish in which\nage range the usual practice applied.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 compares the demographic characteristic for the two\nstudy populations. Many of the infant factors were similar\nbetween the two groups. Infant birth weight was slightly\ndifferent, but this is probably explained by the fact that\nrecruitment for the local study excluded particularly small\ninfants under intensive care. Many of the family factors were\nalso similar; unemployment and non-white families were\nmore prevalent in the national study, but more of the North\nTees families were classified in the lower social stratum.\nTable 2 shows that 47% of the neonates in the local study\nbed-shared with their parents at least once, for all or part of\nthe night (median age at start of sleep log week=13 days,\nIQR 7\u201322). In the national study parents responded that 46%\nof neonates had bed-shared at least occasionally during this\nperiod (median age=20 days, IQR 17\u201325). The prevalence\nof bed-sharing during the 3\u20134 month period (median\nage=98 days, IQR 91\u2013106) fell to 30% in the local study;\nthere were no comparable data available from the national\nstudy.\nTable 1 Demographic characteristics of infants and families in the local and national studies\nLocal study (North Tees) National study (CESDI)\nx2*\n(n df) p valuen\/N (%) n\/N (%)\nInfant factors\nSex (boys) 134\/259 (51.7) 571\/1095 (52.1) 0.00 (1df) 0.96\nMultiple birth 3\/259 (1.2) 7\/1095 (0.6) \u2013 0.41\u0001\nBirth weight ,2.5 kg 5\/259 (1.9) 55\/1087 (5.1) 4.10 (1df) 0.04\nGestation ,37 weeks 10\/233 (4.3) 59\/1083 (5.4) 0.31 (1df) 0.58\nAttempted to breast feed 150\/249 (60.2) 651\/1095 (59.5) 0.02 (1df) 0.87\nFamily factors\nMaternal\nAge ,21 years 32\/259 (12.4) 111\/1095 (10.1) 0.97 (1df) 0.33\nMarital status (single) 13\/253 (5.1) 57\/1095 (5.2) 0.01 (1df) 0.91\nEthnicity (non-white) 6\/259 (2.3) 70\/1095 (6.4) 5.82 (1df) 0.02\nParity .3` 14\/259 (5.4) 81\/1095 (7.4) 0.99 (1df) 0.32\nNo waged income 30\/246 (12.2) 208\/1094 (19.0) 5.93 (1df) 0.02\nSocioeconomic status1\nI\/II 79\/240 (32.9) 351\/1093 (32.1) 5.32 (2df) 0.07\nIIIm\/n 82\/240 (34.2) 451\/1093 (41.3)\nIV\/V\/U 79\/240 (32.9) 291\/1093 (26.6)\nCharacteristics of the CESDI infants aged up to 1 month (N=63) and 3\u20134 months (N=176) were similar to the group as a whole.\n*Using Yates\u2019s corrected value.\n\u0001Fisher\u2019s exact test.\n`Including child in the study.\n1Based on the Registrar General\u2019s Occupational Coding using highest parental classification (I = professional to U = unemployed).\nTable 2 Parent\u2013infant bed-sharing prevalence during night sleep in the 1st and 3rd\u20134th month of infancy\nLocal study (North Tees) National study (CESDI)\nn\/N Prevalence (95% CI*) n\/N\u0001 Prevalence (95% CI*)\nUsual practice\nBed-shared in 1st month\nOccasionally 31\/253 12% 13\/63 21%\nOften 53\/253 21% 8\/63 13%\nAll the time 36\/253 14% 8\/63 13%\nIn total 120\/253 47% (41% to 54%) 29\/63 46% (34% to 58%)\nBed-shared in 3rd\u20134th month\nOccasionally 18\/248 7% \u2013\nOften 37\/248 15% \u2013\nAll the time 19\/248 8% \u2013\nIn total 74\/248 30% (25% to 36%) \u2013\nOn a particular night\nBed-shared in 1st month\nPart of sleep 54\/261 21% 14\/63 22%\nAll of the sleep 16\/261 6% 5\/63 8%\nIn total 70\/261 27% (22% to 33%) 19\/63 30% (20% to 42%)\nBed-shared in 3rd\u20134th month\nPart of sleep 10\/251 4% 22\/176 13%\nAll of sleep 29\/251 12% 13\/176 7%\nIn total 39\/251 16% (12% to 21%) 35\/176 20% (15% to 26%)\n*Using Wilson\u2019s method.\n\u000163 infants were aged 1\u20134 weeks; 176 infants were aged 12\u201316 weeks.\nBed-sharing in England 1107\nwww.archdischild.com\n on 5 November 2009 adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nBoth studies also report the snapshot prevalence of bed-\nsharing on a particular night. Choosing a random night from\nthe local study sleep logs showed 27% of infants bed-shared\nin the first month, while 16% did so in the third month. The\nprevalence in the national study was slightly higher; 30% of\nparents were bed-sharing with infants aged up to 1 month\nand 20% when the infant was aged 3\u20134 months (median\nage=97 days, IQR 90 to 104).\nCombining data from the local and national studies, table 3\nillustrates how the characteristics listed in table 1 were\nassociated with infant bed-sharing. There was no gender\npreference among parents bed-sharing with neonates, how-\never by 3\u20134 months of age there was a higher prevalence of\nmale infants bed-sharing and this statistically significant\ndiscrepancy continued in older infants; 65% (62\/96) of the\ninfants aged 4\u201312 months who were bed-sharing in the\nnational study were male. Neither pre-term nor low birth\nweight infants were more likely to bed-share. Breast feeding\nwas strongly associated with bed-sharing among neonatal\ninfants and their mothers. It is relevant to note that 46% (34\/\n74) of bed-sharing mothers and infants were still breast\nfeeding at 3\u20134 months, twice as many as those mothers and\ninfants sleeping apart (23%, 81\/350), a highly significant\ndifference (x2=14.94, 1 df, p , 0.0001).\nThe prevalence of bed-sharing among non-white ethnic\ngroups was not significantly different but the numbers in\nthese studies were very small. There was no evidence that\nyounger mothers, single mothers, or mothers of larger\nfamilies were more likely to bed-share. Among neonates\nbed-sharing was more prevalent among the least deprived\nsocial classes and at 3\u20134 months of age this discrepancy\nreached statistical significance. However this finding may be\nspecific to early infancy as there was no socioeconomic\ndifference with bed-sharing infants between 4 and 12\nmonths of age in the National study.\nFigure 1 shows a breakdown of bed-sharing on a particular\nnight by age in the national study.

National\nCESDI study.\n1108 Blair, Ball\nwww.archdischild.com\n on 5 November 2009 adc.bmj.comDownloaded from \nleast part of the sleep on any one particular night; from 13 to\n52 weeks this proportion was also 21% (95% CI 18\u201324%).\nIn order to determine whether there was a seasonal effect\non the prevalence of bed-sharing we combined data on tri-\nmonthly prevalence from both studies for bed-sharing among\nneonates and when infants were 3\u20134 months of age (fig 2).\nThere was no seasonal effect among neonatal infants\n(x2=4.53, 3 df, p=0.21), nor at 3\u20134 months of age\n(x2=5.68, 3 df, p=0.12).\nWe also examined whether bed-sharing prevalence fluc-\ntuated on a daily basis (fig 3). Despite a slight mid-week dip,\nno significant difference in the prevalence of bed-sharing at\nthe weekends (Friday and Saturday) compared to weekdays\n(Sunday to Thursday) was found in either neonates or 3\u2013\n4 month old infants.\nDISCUSSION\nWe base our calculations of bed-sharing prevalence on\nquantitative criteria involving a designated sleep night. This\navoids the problems associated with defining the dichotomy\nof \u2018\u2018usual practice\u2019\u2019 which forces parents into categorising\ntheir infant\u2019s predominant sleeping behaviour and generally\nproduces a severe underestimation of prevalence.18 The\nfindings from the two independent studies described here,\nthat nearly 50% of neonates in England bed-share at least\noccasionally, support each other, although both estimates\nmay be conservative. The local study did not record cases\nwhere occasional bed-sharing occurred at a frequency of less\nthan once per week while the national study excluded infants\nless than a week old when bed-sharing is at its peak. One of\nthe few previous English studies, conducted in southeast\nEngland, reported 44% of infants had bed-shared in a\nnominated two week period.19 Estimates of bed-sharing\nprevalence in other westernised countries appear to yield\nsimilar high proportions. A recent study from the USA\nreported that among predominantly low income inner-city\nfamilies 48% of infants regularly bed-shared at 3\u20137 months\nof age and a similar proportion continued to do so up to\none year of age,20 while a large study in New Zealand\ndetermined that 43% of infants recently bed-shared at\n3 months of age.21\nBed-sharing prevalence on a selected night will obviously\nbe much smaller than over a selected period of time, but it\nwas surprising in both studies reported here how many\nparents bed-shared on the designated night. The findings\nsuggest that in England on any particular night more than a\nquarter of parents will be bed-sharing with their neonatal\ninfant for some part of their sleep and that at least a fifth of\nparents will be bed-sharing with older infants. This supports\nfindings from a small longitudinal study conducted in\nAdelaide22 which showed a slightly higher prevalence of\nbed-sharing among younger infants (2\u201312 weeks of age)\ncompared to older infants (13\u201324 weeks of age), but a\nrelatively constant distribution of bed-sharing prevalence\nover the first six months of an infant\u2019s life. Our data did not\nshow a seasonal effect in bed-sharing prevalence or a\nsignificant weekend effect.\nBreast feeding mothers commonly bed-share as a means to\nameliorate the disruption of nocturnal breast feeding,23 24 thus\nwe should expect that breast feeders will predominate in any\npopulation of bed-sharers; an expectation confirmed in both\nthe local and national studies discussed here. Both the\nprevalence of bed-sharing among breast feeding mothers,\nand the benefits of bed-sharing to breast feeding mothers and\ninfants, indicate that common sense safety advice regarding\nbed-sharing, rather than outright prohibition, would be of\nbenefit to the majority of parents and babies.6 24 25\nIn several countries both ethnicity and deprived socio-\neconomic class have been associated with bed-sharing\nprevalence.9 26 Results from this study suggest that bed-\nsharing is prevalent across the social strata in England, if not\nmore common among the least deprived stratum.\n32.9 36.7\n21.7\n28.3\n11.9\n19.1 17.6\n70\n60\n40\n50\n30\n20\n0\n10\nMonth in which bed-sharing was recorded\nNeonatal infants Infants at 3\u20134 months old\nN for each category:\nNeonatal infants = 73, 30, 129, 92  \nInfants at 3\u20134 months old = 151, 89, 68, 118\n%\n b\ned\n-sh\nar\nin\ng\nApr\u2013JunJan\u2013MarOct\u2013DecJul\u2013SepApr\u2013JunJan\u2013Mar Oct\u2013DecJul\u2013Sep\n22.9\nFigure 2 Bed-sharing on a specific\nnight by month (neonates and infants at\n3\u20134 months) (prevalence in three month\nblocks with 95% CIs).

These findings do not reflect those\nfound in other Western industrialised nations where bed-\nsharing is characterised as an infant care-giving strategy\npracticed by certain deprived ethnic and socioeconomic\ngroups. It is important, therefore, that assumptions regarding\nbed-sharing prevalence and circumstance are not extrapo-\nlated from the international literature and applied indis-\ncriminately in discussions of bed-sharing in England.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nGrant bodies for the national study include funds from (1) National\nAdvisory Body for the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and\nDeaths in Infancy (CESDI), (2) the Foundation for the Study of\nInfant Deaths (FSID), and (3) Babes in Arms.
