RESEARCH PROBLEM\nWHERE quantitative engineering and qualitative designconcepts are used together to deliver a product, they need\nto be accurately represented, thereby: 1) facilitating taking ad-\nvantage of human approximate reasoning and qualitative judg-\nment; 2) enabling delivery in cases where an accurate mathe-\nmatical representation of a design solution search space is not\nreadily available; 3) achieving built-in flexibility where defini-\ntions of design criteria or their relative importance change; and\n4) achieving better problem understanding, which in turn can\npromote innovative solution discovery.\nTypical examples where the two types of views are merged\ninclude automotive design, appliance design, and architectural\ndesign [1]. However , there exist very few, if any, models that\nsuccessfully incorporate qualitative and quantitative influences\nin a formal manner [2]. In ergonomic product design, this gap\nmanifests itself in two ways.\n1) A splitting of aims, where ergonomists evaluate designs\nbased on either only qualitative concerns or only quan-\ntitative concerns (or a nonformal mixture of both). For\nexample, an account of comfort taken firsthand from the\ntarget user might be considered as the only measure of\nwhether a chair is ergonomic.

The constraints on the design include: size\nconstraints that vary among different population segments for\nwhich the design is intended; and some shape constraints that\nreflect the image of the firm in the marketplace. While some of\nthese criteria and constraints are of qualitative concern, the rest\nare quantitative.\nThe responsibility of satisfying the different criteria typically\nremains within different departments. As formal weightings\nare not given to different criteria, and the interaction between\ncriteria is left unexplored, the process of design improvement\ntakes place via a lengthy negotiation process between depart-\nments. The chair design example clearly demonstrates the way\nin which qualitative and quantitative criteria are optimized\nwithout a formal optimization framework.\nThis paper is concerned with the development of a novel algo-\nrithmic framework to bring qualitative and quantitative design\ncriteria together, in order to facilitate solution search and eval-\nuation. The framework is based on principles of multicriteria\ndecision making and user-interactive evolutionary optimization\ntechniques. Part of the chair design problem is used for testing\nthe framework.\nSection II outlines the principles that lay the foundation of\nthe framework. Section III describes the chair design problem\nwith which the algorithms are tested. Section IV describes three\nalgorithms that follow the framework. Section V compares the\nresults obtained from these three algorithms using fitness con-\nvergence, diversity, and user preference metrics.

INCLUSION OF QUALITATIVE DESIGN CRITERIA USING\nEVOLUTIONARY MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION:\nA NEW APPROACH\nA. Qualitative Criteria in Design\nQualitative is a term typically used in opposition to the\nword quantitative, which refers to numerically representable\nphenomena whose characteristics are objective and context-in-\ndependent. The term qualitative, on the other hand, refers to\nphenomena whose characteristics are best expressed by narra-\ntions, opinions and beliefs rather than quantities. Qualitative\ncharacteristics are subjective and they may vary according to\nthe domain in which they are handled.\nWe previously distinguished the different types of qualitative\nphenomena that occur during the design optimization process,\nsuch as multidimensionally and unidimensionally qualitative\ncriteria [1]. This paper focuses on multidimensionally qualita-\ntive criteria, even the conceptual meaning of which is difficult\nto codify and quantify. Adjectives such as ergonomic, pretty,\neasily handlable, and comfortable are examples of multidimen-\nsionally qualitative criteria.\nThere exist two approaches for supporting multidimension-\nally qualitative views in design: 1) generalizing the qualitative\nopinion in a way that reflects the majority view or 2) consid-\nering individuality. In today\u2019s competitive design world, con-\nsiderable attention is given to satisfy a diverse range of cus-\ntomer demands, and design customization and market segmen-\ntation are practised to serve to individual sensitivities. The work\nreported in this paper adopts the second view for dealing with\nmultidimensional qualitativeness.\nIn ergonomic design, the formalization of qualitative criteria\nand their integration with quantitative criteria can lead to ad-\nvantages such as flexibility in solution definition and search, re-\nducing design improvement time, better problem understanding,\nand better solution delivery by taking advantage of human qual-\nitative judgment.\nThe rest of this section focuses on the principles used to make\nsuch an integration possible.\nB. Multiobjective Optimization\nMultiobjective1 design optimization is defined as the problem\nof finding a vector of decision variables that optimizes a vector\nfunction whose elements represent multiple objective functions.\nThe basis of multiobjective optimization comes from the need\nto achieve compromise decision-making in a problem of many\nconflicting objectives. In such an environment, the ideal plat-\nform would enable us to gather and present a diverse set of so-\nlutions, each with its own offering of different levels of objective\nsatisfaction, so that a choice of solution or solutions can easily\nbe reached. In our novel framework, qualitative influences in er-\ngonomic design are viewed as design criteria, which make mul-\ntiobjective optimization an ideal base from which to formally\ndefine the design problem in terms of its objectives, objective\npreferences, and constraints. Multiobjective optimization alone\ndoes not consider qualitative criteria, or subjective influences on\n1We use \u201cobjective\u201d here in the sense of \u201cdesign goal,\u201d \u201cqualitative\u201d for a de-\nsign goal that is subjective, and \u201cquantitative\u201d for a design goal that is objective.\nquantitative criteria, as it is a method developed essentially to\noptimize multiple functions that are quantitatively represented.\nC. Multiobjective Optimization With Genetic Algorithms\n(GAs)\nRecently, the usage of evolutionary computing (EC) tech-\nniques in multiobjective optimization has become popular. A\nmultiobjective optimization problem modeled by EC is termed\nevolutionary multiple-objective optimization (EMO). The\nsuitability of EC and, particularly, genetic algorithms (GAs), a\nsubset of EC, for multiple-objective optimization is described\nin [4].\nD. Interactive Genetic Algorithms (IGAs)\nInteractive evolutionary computation (IEC) is an EC method\nthat optimizes a target system based on human subjective eval-\nuation, where the human plays the role of the fitness function\nof conventional EC [5]. IGAs are a type of IEC based on the\nprinciples of GA. Parmee defined IGA broadly as system opti-\nmization based on human-machine interaction [6]. When IGA\nis applied to optimization problems such as engineering design,\nergonomic design, or architecture, interaction with a human\nevaluator facilitates the generation of solutions that incorporate\nhuman expertise or intuition without having to explicitly codify\nthem into the optimization platform. Interaction between a user\nand the system can proceed in many ways depending on the\ntask domain. In addition to assigning the qualitative fitness of\nan individual design, the user may intervene by choosing elite\ndesigns for survival, modifying an individual and reinserting it\ninto the population of designs, and freezing parts of the design\nwith the intention of reducing the search space dimensionality.\nAs opposed to conventional artificial intelligence methods\nthat try to model human subjectivity and qualitative decisions,\nIGA incorporates the human, not a model of the human, into\nthe optimization system. This simplicity and efficiency makes\nIGA an ideal candidate method for incorporating qualitative\ninfluences into design optimization.\nIt is important to emphasize that optimization with IGA pro-\nduces subjectively influenced designs. Alone it does not con-\nsider quantitative criteria. The interaction of the user is required\nto drive the GA itself. Since interaction with the user is used as\nthe fitness function, this inevitably brings subjectivity into the\noptimization process. This is so, even when the user assesses\nthe design from a mathematically representable, i.e., quantita-\ntive, objective.\nE. A Review of Previous Approaches for Integrating\nMultidimensional Qualitativeness in Quantitative Optimization\nOne method for handling multidimensional qualitative views\nis to represent them quantitatively according to the individual\npreferences of the designer, who articulates his\/her qualitative\ndesign objectives, and, considering how the objective is con-\ncretely realized, describes objective preferences and the rea-\nsoning behind them. This description is then incorporated into\nthe EMO problem quantitatively using fuzzy modeling. There\nis a lack of flexibility should the designer change his\/her mind\nor should a new subobjective need to be incorporated, since the\nfuzzy model then needs to be readjusted.\nBRINTRUP et al.: ERGONOMIC CHAIR DESIGN BY FUSING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA USING IGAS 345\nThe above procedure of using fuzzy modeling in EMO to rep-\nresent qualitativeness has been proposed by Oduguwa et al. [7].\nThey suggested that for every quantitative solution lying on the\nPareto front, there exists a corresponding qualitative evaluation\nexpressing the designer\u2019s opinion about the problem, and that\nthis qualitative evaluation stands in a unique relation with the\nquantitative solution. The approach mainly deals with quantita-\ntive and qualitative information that are inherently conflicting.\nThe authors reported that many qualitative objectives increase\nfragmentation of search space.\nParmee et al. [6] have developed the interactive evolutionary\ndesign system (IEDS), where a rule-based preference compo-\nnent of the algorithm allows the designer to interactively express\nhis\/her preferences in terms of natural language, which then di-\nrect the MOO search into compromise regions. Software agents\nmonitor the coevolutionary processes, and the satisfaction of ob-\njectives and constraints using a designer preference rule base.\nIn both Oduguwa et al. and Parmee et al.\u2019s approaches, multi-\ndimensional qualitative data were not handled.\nAnother previous approach for integrating qualitativeness\ninto optimization is partial interaction. In the nurse scheduling\nsystem developed by Inoue et al. [8] the optimization functions\nare quantitative. A Pareto-based vector-evaluated genetic algo-\nrithm evolves a set of solutions. The nurse interacts with the\nsystem after the solutions are generated by this quantitative op-\ntimization. He\/she views and modifies the scheduling solutions\nand reinserts them into the population.\nIn a similar system developed for molecular docking, users\nare able to modify the GA-generated solutions [9]. The GA\nevolved a quantitative function for a number of generations.\nThen, users attempt to dock a GA-generated ligand manually\nin a virtual reality environment. This solution then replaced the\nworse solution in the population found by the GA. They reported\nthat solutions that did not use interaction were better than solu-\ntions with interaction. This was due to the limitations of the vir-\ntual reality environment and the large number of atoms, which\nmade it difficult for the user to realize which part of the mole-\ncule was being viewed during docking. This system did not use\nmultiobjective optimization, nor did it use user-assigned fitness\nin the GA.\nAn interesting method is the collaborative project scheduling\nsystem proposed by Shackelford and Corne [10]. Here, the\nquantitative fitness of a schedule is first calculated. The sched-\nules are then presented to the user in order of that quantitative\nfitness. To each, the user assigns a qualitative fitness score,\nwhich is then used to breed the next generation. In other words,\nquantitative fitness score is not used to breed the next gener-\nation. These workers reported that the evolutionary scheduler\noutperformed standard quantitative criteria-based industry\npackages in terms of user satisfaction. However, difficulty in\nthe evaluation of solutions was a concern, which suggests that\na more integrative approach to qualitative and quantitative\ncriteria might indeed improve evaluation.\nHowever, another approach to handle multidimensional\nqualitativeness is Kamalian et al.\u2019s microelectromechanical\nsystems (MEMS) design platform [11]. Here, IGA was used as\na single objective optimization method, after the generation of\ntradeoff solutions with a multiobjective genetic algorithm that\noptimized designs according to various quantitative objectives.\nTheir system showed that the preferences of designers were sig-\nnificantly oriented towards designs that were optimized by the\nIEC-enhanced system, compared with the designs optimized\nwithout IEC.\nWe have ourselves previously proposed an alternative frame-\nwork where the user provides interactive fitness assignments\nfor multidimensionally qualitative design views. The multidi-\nmensionally qualitative design views are then treated as qual-\nitative objectives, the attainment of which is optimized along\nwith the quantitative design objectives using an EMO algorithm\n[1], [12], the well-known nondominated sorting genetic algo-\nrithm 2 (NSGA 2). We also developed and tested a parallel IGA\nand a sequential IGA as alternative EMO approaches for op-\ntimizing multidimensionally qualitative and quantitative objec-\ntives together [13].\nMachwe et al. have also subsequently employed a similar\napproach to bridge design [14]. In their system, a multidimen-\nsional qualitative criterion was integrated as an objective to the\nEMO. The EMO algorithm used was the strength Pareto evolu-\ntionary algorithm (SPEA). Some of the user scoring was given\nby software agents. A machine learning system was proposed\nto reduce the burden on the user.\nIn Machwe et al.\u2019s most recent work, a mutation-only evo-\nlutionary program attempted to optimize a weighted sum func-\ntion based on five criteria, two of which were rule based- or\nuser-given aesthetic criteria, while the rest were quantitatively\nevaluated structural criteria [15]. They reported that when the\nuser-given criterion was set to the maximum weight, 2 out of 12\nfigures survived into the final population, which would not have\nbeen the case if user-given criteria had not been included. The\nstructural performance of these solutions in the overall search\nspace was not reported. However, it was argued that concep-\ntual design using this approach is acceptable and any structural\nproblems that may arise could be solved with the introduction\nof appropriate materials or skeletal frameworks at a later stage.\nThey concluded that further development of machine-based aes-\nthetic assessment is essential.\nIn our work, we affirm that the interactively given user criteria\ndo not hinder other criteria, and result in a compromise decision\nthat satisfies all design constraints with the best possible blend.\nIt is evident that user interaction during multicriteria design op-\ntimization results in innovative and good solutions. In order to\ngain insight into the means of reaching optimum designs that\nblend quantitative and qualitative criteria, further research on\nthe mechanisms of compromise decision-making is essential.\nTo establish such a compromise decision-making mecha-\nnism, first, it is important to differentiate the types of qualitative\ncriteria and develop different frameworks to target them [1].\nSecond, new EMO-based approaches capable of accommo-\ndating qualitative-quantitative compromise decision-making\nneed to be developed and tested. In this paper, in contrast to\nall the previous approaches, we apply and develop our novel\nEMO-based sequential, parallel, and multiobjective IGAs, and\napply them to ergonomic chair design. The sequential IGA\napproach simulates a commonly deployed optimization method\nfor multiple objectives. The multiobjective IGA approach\nmodifies the NSGA 2. The parallel IGA approach is an alter-\n346 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 12, NO. 3, JUNE 2008\nnative approach for EMO. The algorithms are collected under\nthe interactive multiobjective design optimization (IMODO)\nframework explained in the next section.\nIn this paper, in contrast to all the previous approaches, we\napply and develop our sequential, parallel, and multiobjective\nIGAs to ergonomic chair design. The sequential IGA approach\nsimulates a commonly deployed optimization method for mul-\ntiple objectives. The multiobjective IGA approach modifies the\nNSGA 2. The parallel IGA approach is an alternative approach\nfor EMO. The algorithms are collected under the IMODO\nframework explained in the next section.\nF. Interactive Multiobjective Design Optimization (IMODO)\nFramework\nThe IMODO framework is composed of three components.\n1) The EMO platform, which optimizes qualitative and quan-\ntitative objectives together based on GA principles and fol-\nlows a multiobjective optimization philosophy.\n2) User interaction, which involves the designer acting as the\nqualitative fitness evaluation function. The designer can\ndynamically change constraints and preferences between\nobjectives. The designer can modify solutions and reinsert\nthem into the system, and freeze different features of the\ndesign at hand.\n3) Computer-generated solutions, i.e., the quantitative fitness\nevaluations performed by the computer through a built-in\nfunction.\nIII. THE CHAIR DESIGN PROBLEM\nPosture is simply the position of the body during an activity\n(including resting). An awkward posture is associated with an\nincreased risk of injury. It is considered that the more a joint\ndeviates from the neutral (natural) position, the greater the risk\nof injury [16].\nErgonomic chair design is sometimes evaluated by measure-\nments on how the chair fits to a given percentage of parts of\nthe body in a given posture (i.e., reclining, working etc.), some-\ntimes by live experiments in which a sitter\u2019s feeling of comfort\nis recorded, or often by a mixture of both. In the present study,\nwe define the ergonomic chair design problem as the problem\nof finding an optimum set of parameters that control the shape\nof the chair with respect to a given posture.\nTwo types of objectives are included in the problem: a quali-\ntative objective based on the designer\u2019s evaluation of how suit-\nable the chair looks for a particular posture, and a quantitative\nobjective that measures how closely the chair fits to the sitter\u2019s\nposture.\nFor the purpose of simplicity, the algorithm starts from\nrandom solutions and not pre-encoded chromosomes that\nrepresent existing chairs (although would be possible with our\nframework). Again for simplicity, preferences, i.e., weighting\nbetween objectives, are kept equal. The user interaction is only\nthrough ratings, and the user does not modify parameter or\nconstraint values during the optimization process\nThe design variables are shown in Fig. 1 (upper). The\nheadrest, backrest, angle of backrest to seat, footrest, angle of\nfootrest to seat, and seat height are included, while the armrest,\nseat contour, and cushioning are not taken into account for\nsimplicity. A real valued string is encoded.\nIn terms of representation, the real-coded chromosome con-\nsisted of dimensional chair parameters shown in Fig. 1. Ten con-\ntrol points were used for the B-spline, followed by centripetal\nspline interpolation.\nThe following objective functions were defined.\nObjective function 1\n(1)\nwhere the user given rating from a scale of 0\u20139 denotes the\nuser\u2019s comfort and liking of the design.\nObjective function 2, shown in (2) at the bottom of the page.\nThe parameters used in the quantitative objective function are\nshown on Fig. 1 (lower part), where and are\nB-spline points denoting a B-spline approximation of the chair\u2019s\nbackrest spine and the person\u2019s spine.\n\u2022 is the chair\u2019s headrest midpoint;\n\u2022 is the person\u2019s head midpoint projected to the back of\nhead;\n\u2022 is the chair\u2019s knee point;\n\u2022 is the person\u2019s knee point;\n\u2022 is the chair\u2019s end of footrest point;\n\u2022 is the person\u2019s end of footrest point.\nThe following constraints were coded.\n\u2022 constraint [0] chair knee angle person knee\nangle (in degrees);\n\u2022 constraint [1] chair headrest angle 180;\n\u2022 constraint [2] chair angle of backrest to seat\n180.\nThe seated human body\u2019s positional data is a predefined and\nfixed model, which is based on the 99 percentile white male\nbody [17]. As examined above, multiple objectives, multiple\n(2)\nBRINTRUP et al.: ERGONOMIC CHAIR DESIGN BY FUSING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA USING IGAS 347\nFig. 1. Upper part illustrates chair design parameters while lower part shows\nobjective function parameters.\nconstraints, and a mixture of qualitative and quantitative objec-\ntives all constitute the features of the chair design problem. The\nproblem, therefore, is ideal for testing the framework proposed\nin Section II-F. The following section outlines three different al-\ngorithmic approaches that make use of the proposed framework.\nThe results are outlined and discussed in Section V.\nIV. MULTIOBJECTIVE CHAIR DESIGN WITH IGAS\nA. Sequential IGA\nThe sequential IGA deals with multiple objectives by taking\nturns to optimize the quantitative and qualitative objectives\nindependently.\nA single population is evolved by a sequentially switched fit-\nness function. An initial qualitative run is performed with a con-\nventional IGA. Users are allowed to give the same rating to more\nthan one design. The qualitatively evaluated run is followed by\na given number of quantitative optimization runs, where fitness\nis evaluated by a regular fitness function.\nThe individuals created from a qualitative run are fed into\nthe following quantitative run as parent designs, ensuring that\nthe start point for the quantitative run is the qualitatively opti-\nmized designs. This is how the connection between qualitative\nand quantitative criteria is ensured.\nWith this algorithm, we aimed to represent a typical design\ncycle in a design firm, where the design is \u201cthrown over the\nwall\u201d between the marketing department that is concerned with\nqualitative aspects of the design, and the R&D Department that\nis concerned with quantitative aspects. Fig. 2 shows the flow of\nsequential IGA.\nB. Parallel IGA\nEC techniques are suitable for parallelization, since\ncrossover, mutation, and evaluation can be performed in-\ndependently. It is possible to separate individuals themselves to\nbe evolved in separate locations or programs to enable different\nselection and recombination routines for each individual. The\nreason for choosing parallelization depends very much on the\nproblem at hand. Parallelization can be a solution for computa-\ntionally demanding problems, for applying different selection\nand recombination routines to individuals, or for separating\npopulations, as in our case. In any of these cases, three main\nparallelization techniques are widely used [18].\n1) Master-slave parallelization, where a single processor\nmaintains control over selection and uses the other pro-\ncessors only for crossover, mutation and evaluation of\nindividuals. This technique is useful for few processors\nand very large evaluation times.\n2) Island model, where every processor runs an independent\nEC. The processors cooperate by regularly exchanging\nelite migrants. This technique is suitable for clustering\npopulations.\n3) Diffusion model, where the individuals mate with other in-\ndividuals only in the local neighborhood. This technique is\nparticularly suitable for massively parallel computers with\na fast local intercommunication network.\nThe use of parallelization on EMO can be effective as the goal\nof EMO is to find a set of good solutions rather than a single\noptimum, and there is a limited amount of literature on the use\nof parallelization in EMO [19], [20]. On the other hand, the use\nof parallelization techniques in IEC has not been reported except\nin our previous work [13].\nWe propose that the use of parallelization and interactivity\ntogether is advantageous and natural for our problem. Solutions\nto multiple objectives can be evolved in separate populations\nwith elite migrants exchanged between one another, i.e., fol-\nlowing the island model. The qualitative fitness of a solution on\nthe qualitatively evaluated population island is obtained\nthrough user interaction, while another population on the quan-\ntitatively evaluated population island is evolved through\na regular fitness function. With this method, a compromise deci-\nsion can be encouraged by the migration of elites between pop-\nulations. However, it takes much longer for a user to evaluate\ndesigns than a computer. If the objectives are optimized on sep-\narate populations, the can have more iterations, while the\nis optimized. Similarly, a bigger population size can be\nused with resulting in faster convergence, whereas this is\ngenerally not possible with PQL due to the burden on the user.\nThe features of the parallel IGA are as follows.\n1) Parallelization technique: the parallel IGA uses an island\nmodel and optimizes separate populations with sep-\narate objectives with immigrants exchanged among them.\nIn our experiments, we use .\n2) Immigrant selection: the top three elite solutions are se-\nlected from each population and forced to migrate.\n3) Replacement strategy: the least performing three indi-\nvidual solutions from each population are replaced with\nthe immigrants.\n348 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 12, NO. 3, JUNE 2008\nFig. 2. Sequential IGA procedure.\nFig. 3. Parallel IGA procedure.\n4) Strategy of fitness assignment to immigrants: In , im-\nmigrants are sorted with respect to their user-given rating.\nIf any two ratings are equal, sorting is done using the cal-\nculated quantitative objective fitness. After sorting, an ar-\nbitrary quantitative fitness is assigned to the immigrants to\nensure their survival. The arbitrary fitness assignment pro-\nceeds as follows.\n1) Sort immigrants according to qualitative fitness, in de-\nscending order, i.e., the individual with the best quali-\ntative fitness ranks first.\n2) If any two qualitative fitness values are equal, sort\nthose that are equal according to quantitative fitness.\n3) Assign the current generation\u2019s best quantitative fit-\nness value to the immigrant with rank 1.\n4) Assign 110% of the current generation\u2019s best quantita-\ntive fitness value to the immigrant with rank 2.\n5) Assign 120% of the current generation\u2019s best quantita-\ntive fitness value to the immigrant with rank 3.\nIn , immigrants are all given the minimum, i.e., the best,\nqualitative fitness. The reason is that the qualitative fitness rating\nis a discrete value and designs taking the same rating are al-\nlowed. However, it is very unlikely that any two designs would\nbe assigned the same quantitative fitness after (computer) eval-\nuation. On the other hand, even though two designs may differ\nfrom each other, the user might give them the same rating. Fig. 3\nshows the flow of the parallel IGA procedure.\nC. Multiobjective IGA\nMultiobjective IGA is based on a modified version of a pop-\nular multiobjective optimization algorithm, the nondominated\nsorting GA 2 devised by Deb et al. [21]. This algorithm en-\nhances the usual nondomination-based multiobjective optimiza-\ntion techniques by introducing the concepts of elitism and diver-\nsity. Elitism ensures the preservation of globally good solutions\nfrom generation to generation. Diversity ensures achieving a set\nof well-spread solutions in the objective space.\nIn the nondominated sorting GA 2, elitism is achieved by\ncombining parent and offspring populations before sorting them\nfor nondomination. Nondomination of a solution shows how\nmany solutions are better in all criteria then the current solution.\nThe nondominated sorting GA 2 also tries to obtain diverse so-\nlutions on the Pareto front by performing the so-called crowding\ndistance calculation. Reference [21] contains a detailed descrip-\ntion of the nondominated sorting GA 2 procedure.\nWe included interactive fitness assignments in the nondomi-\nnated sorting GA 2, and renamed the algorithm multiobjective\nIGA. The qualitative objective rating for a solution is obtained\nfrom the user, whereas the quantitative fitness of a solution is\nassessed by the built-in fitness function. Fig. 4 shows the flow\nof multiobjective IGA.\nV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND COMPARISON\nA. Experimental Parameters\nWe carried out six runs for each algorithmic approach. All al-\ngorithms were real-coded, and used tournament selection, mu-\ntation with a rate of 0.01 and a distribution index of 10, and\none-point simulated binary crossover with a rate of 0.9 and a\ndistribution index of 20. The distribution index is any nonnega-\ntive real number, which is used to derive the probability distri-\nbution in turn used to create a child solution. A large distribution\nindex results in a higher probability for creating near-parent so-\nlutions and, conversely, a small value allows distant solutions to\nbe selected. These parameters were kept constant throughout to\nBRINTRUP et al.: ERGONOMIC CHAIR DESIGN BY FUSING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA USING IGAS 349\nFig. 4. Multiobjective IGA.\nFig. 5. Graphical user interface of the sequential IGA chair design platform.\nThe interface includes various viewing functions such as zooming, panning,\nlight adjustment, and other adjustment functions such as anthropological data\nentering, and B-spline parameter editing. The user enters qualitative fitness\nusing the scoring toolbar. The GA parameters can also be adjusted via the\ninterface.\nallow a valid comparison of the three approaches. Each of the\nsix runs of any given algorithm started with a different random-\nization seed, which was reused in the other algorithms.\nHuman users were two females and three males of ages\n24\u201332, whose expertise ranged over product design, design\nengineering, and aerospace engineering. The users continued\nto run the programs until qualitative generation 6 was reached.\nEach user conducted one test for sequential IGA, parallel IGA,\nand multiobjective IGA. The graphical user interface is shown\nin Fig. 5.\nThe number of generations and the population sizes for each\nalgorithm is given in Table I.\nThe rest of this section describes the performances of the\nsequential IGA, parallel IGA, and multiobjective IGA, under\nthree performance metrics, namely, fitness convergence, diver-\nsity, and user preference.\nFitness convergence is chosen as it is the most common\nmetric used to evaluate the optimization capabilities of genetic\nalgorithms. However, this metric is mainly used in quantitative\ncriteria problems. As the research problem described in this\npaper involves qualitative criteria, we included two additional\nmetrics to provide a more accurate comparison between the\nresults. The diversity metric comes from the multiobjective\noptimization philosophy. It is ideal to obtain solutions that are\noptimal with a blend of criterion satisfaction, as well as being\ndiverse, so that the decision-maker is offered as much a variety\nof choices as possible. The user preference metric comes from\nthe need to assess the ultimate success of qualitative concerns\nin the very domain from which it has originated\u2014that of the\nuser.\nB. Fitness Convergence\nSequential IGA, parallel IGA, and multiobjective IGA\nwere compared over 55, 5, and 55 generations, respectively,\nin terms of: 1) overall average qualitative fitness; 2) overall\naverage quantitative fitness; 3) average qualitative fitness of\nthe last generation; and 4) average quantitative fitness of the\nlast generation. Fig. 6 shows sample individuals obtained at\ngenerations 1, 3, and 5 from the multiobjective IGA approach.\nTable II shows the results of the Wilcoxon signed rank test,\nan experimental procedure commonly applied to assess user\nresponse when evaluating interactively evolved systems. A\nprevious application includes [22], where physiological data\nresponse to changes in environment was used as a fitness\nmeasure to evolve artificial environments. This nonparametric\npair observation test is used to compare average and final\nquantitative and qualitative fitness values obtained from each\nalgorithm with the aim of concluding which algorithm results\nin significant success. In our work, for instance, multiobjective\nIGA was significantly more successful in obtaining the best\naverage qualitative fitness compared with parallel IGA. A risk\nfactor was used to assess the significance of conclusions: a\n350 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOL. 12, NO. 3, JUNE 2008\nTABLE I\nPOPULATION SIZES, NUMBERS OF GENERATIONS, AND USER EVALUATIONS PER ALGORITHM\nFig. 6. Sample individuals obtained from multiobjective IGA at (a) generation\n1, (b) generation 3, and (c) generation 5. Different colors are used to highlight\ndifferent parts of the chair.\nfactor of 5% means that the comparative round was in favor of\nthe winner with a significance of 95%.\nParallel IGA obtained the best quantitative convergence and\na better qualitative trend than the sequential IGA. The peaks\nin the quantitative objective convergence illustrate the gener-\nations when qualitatively superior immigrants were received,\nwhich indicates a conflict between the qualitative and quanti-\ntative objectives.\nFig. 7 shows the average fitness values obtained at each gen-\neration of each algorithm.\nIn the sequential IGA, the average qualitative fitness showed a\nworsening trend over the five runs, while the quantitative results\nshowed a smoothly improving trend.\nThe best qualitative convergence, and good convergence in\nquantitative criteria, were obtained with the multiobjective IGA.\nThe fitness improved with respect to both objectives and conver-\ngence to the Pareto front was observed.\nThe multiobjective IGA attained designs that were satisfac-\ntory to the user in five generations, whereas the sequential IGA\nfailed to reach an equally satisfactory design in a total of 50\ngenerations. The parallel IGA showed some satisfactory designs\nwithin five generations in .\nAlthough the final quantitative fitness scores were better in\nthe sequential IGA and the parallel IGA than the multiobjec-\ntive IGA, the sequential IGA performed significantly worse than\nother two IGAs when the qualitative objective is considered.\nRather than reaching a compromise decision between qualita-\ntive and quantitative factors, the sequential IGA set the two ob-\njectives in competition against each other; resetting and trying\nto recover from the effects of the opposing objective each time.\nA point to bear in mind is the number of generations pur-\nsued with each algorithm. The multiobjective IGA pursues one\nquantitative and one qualitative generation together at a time,\nsince the evolution is simultaneous. As the user must be involved\nin every generation, only five quantitative generations could be\nevolved due to user fatigue. Even so, the finally attained quan-\ntitative objective was better than that achieved by the sequen-\ntial IGA at its fifth generation. This is attributed to the criteria\nbeing optimized together for five generations as opposed to the\nsequential optimization philosophy followed in sequential IGA.\nDuring the fifth quantitative run, the sequential IGA still tries to\nrid itself of the effects of the qualitative run it performed earlier.\nThe superior quantitative convergence of the parallel IGA is\nattributed to its bigger population size (50 individuals). Such a\nlarge population could not be introduced in the other two algo-\nrithms as only one population is evolved as opposed to two in\nthe parallel IGA.\nA final point to consider is the difficulty of obtaining a smooth\nconvergence in the qualitative criteria due to human inconsis-\ntency and intergenerational scoring. When using IGA, a math-\nematically consistent rating that impacts in proportion or in ac-\ncordance with changes in the qualitative space cannot be guar-\nanteed. Possible reasons for this might be simply the user not\nremembering older designs for an accurate comparison, or not\nbeing able to provide a rating that can accurately represent this\ncomparison with a score. Intergenerational scoring occurs when\nthe user compares the designs only within the current gener-\nation. Intragenerational rating occurs when the user evaluates\nthe designs with respect to all her designs seen so far; the latter\nplaces a heavy burden on the user and can lead to inconsistent\nscoring. In this case, a slight improvement in the overall fitness\ncan still be observed, but the user preference metric tells us more\nthan qualitative criteria convergence.\nC. Diversity\nAfter the third quantitative run (i.e., the 30th quantitative,\n33rd overall generation) of the sequential IGA, the design\nreached a quantitative optimum, all available designs having\nthen little or no difference (users reported difficulty in dis-\ntinguishing the designs). Even though minor differences still\nexisted, they were difficult to visualize and evaluate compar-\natively. This led the users to give similar ratings to all the\ndesigns, and it became difficult for the algorithm to diversify\nthem. On the other hand, the diversity-preservation mechanism\nin the multiobjective IGA provided results that were visually\ndistinct from each other. Although no quantification of diversity\nBRINTRUP et al.: ERGONOMIC CHAIR DESIGN BY FUSING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA USING IGAS 351\nTABLE II\nCOMPARISONS OF THE PARALLEL, SEQUENTIAL AND MULTIOBJECTIVE IGAS IN TERMS OF\nTHEIR QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FITNESS CONVERGENCES\nFig. 7. Change of average (a) quantitative and (b) qualitative fitness in sequen-\ntial IGA, multiobjective IGA, and parallel IGA.\nwas performed, increasing diversity was evidently obtained\nfrom sequential IGA, parallel IGA, to multiobjective IGA.\nD. User Preference\nTable III shows the preferences of users on the final set of\ndesign solutions obtained from each algorithm. sign indi-\ncates that a particular user mostly preferred the designs obtained\nby one algorithm over the other algorithms with which it was\nbeing compared. The preference scores were obtained by pair-\nwise comparison. Overall, multiobjective IGA solutions yielded\nthe most preferred results, followed by parallel IGA and then se-\nquential IGA.\nIn contrast, Machwe reported that it was difficult to steer the\npath of evolution to the qualitative fitness in his interactive EMO\napplication to bridge design [23]. Our results show that although\nthe parallel IGA provided the user with a bigger selection of\nfinal generation designs to choose from, the multiobjective IGA\ngave better user steering towards the qualitative fitness than the\nsequential and the parallel IGA. This could be due to the task-\ndependant conditions used in the multiobjective algorithm.\nVI. COMPARISON WITH USER GIVEN FITNESS FUNCTION\nIn addition to experimentation with direct user fitness assign-\nment, we also pursued experimentation with a user-given evalu-\nation function. The goals of this experimentation are to analyze\nhow inconsistency affects the qualitative fitness convergence,\nand to comparatively analyze the behavior of the algorithms.\nWe asked the users to describe their qualitative criteria for\nevaluating the chair. The following criteria were gathered from\nthe users:\n1) symmetrical chair legs;\n2) minimum difference between chair back length and user\u2019s\nback length;\n3) minimum difference between chair front leg length and\nuser\u2019s front leg length;\n4) minimum difference between chair head rest length and\nuser\u2019s head length.\nWith the response we formulated the following objective\nfunction:\n(3)\nThis objective function replaced the objective function 1 out-\nlined in Section III.\nThe results in Fig. 8 show the average fitness values obtained\nat each generation of each run.\nIt is apparent that without user inconsistency or the effect\nof intra\/intergenerational scoring, qualitative fitness displays a\nsmoother convergence than if fitness is interactively assigned\nby the user. The persistence of the qualitative objective wors-\nened the quantitative fitness convergence of the parallel IGA.\nThe peaks in the quantitative fitness convergence appear to be\nmore dramatic than when interactive user evaluation is used.\nThe qualitative objective is more consistent without interac-\ntive user evaluation, which could explain the higher peaks. The\nmultiobjective IGA displays the worst qualitative and quanti-\ntative fitness convergence, which is expected as this algorithm\ntakes more time to optimize both objectives together.

KEY OBSERVATIONS AND DISCUSSION\nThe aim of this work was to provide a complementary design\nframework that formally brings qualitative and quantitative de-\nsign criteria together. The algorithms that follow the principles\nof the framework were tested by the ergonomic chair design\nproblem. A truly ergonomic design process needs live experi-\nmentation; providing a completely computer-based ergonomic\ndesign optimization framework is neither desirable nor possible.\nA more complete understanding of the problem can be achieved\nby formally incorporating qualitative criteria into ergonomic\ndesign, and using both qualitative and quantitative criteria to\ncomplement the solution search instead of engaging in an epis-\ntemological argument over which view is better. The multi-\nobjective philosophy helps the designer to understand the solu-\ntion landscape. Within our framework, the use of GA provides\nflexible and simple design encoding and optimization. Interac-\ntive designer involvement provides a simple yet efficient way\nto include qualitative concerns into the design process. As the\nuser modifies individuals and reinserts them into the population,\nand gains information about the behavior of the multiobjective\nsearch space, the framework becomes a two-way informative\nprocess.\nThe main advantage of parallel IGA is its flexibility to accom-\nmodate more than one population. The population size in mul-\ntiobjective IGA needs to be constant as multiple objectives are\nhandled simultaneously in each design. In parallel IGA, limiting\nthe population of qualitatively evaluated designs and increasing\nthe number of quantitatively evolved designs is possible. This\nmakes sure that the time spent by the human during design eval-\nuation is well utilized. As more individuals and generations can\nbe evolved in the quantitatively optimized island, we can get a\nbetter fitness in that role. As the populations are on different is-\nlands, the parallel IGA does not induce a fight between the two\nobjectives, qualitative and quantitative, as in the case of sequen-\ntial IGA. In sequential IGA, increasing the size of the population\nwhen it is evaluated by a quantitative objective function is also\npossible.\nThe multiobjective IGA and the parallel IGA are significantly\nbetter than the sequential IGA in terms of the final solutions\nachieved. Sequential optimization, although it is the most com-\nmonly used ergonomic optimization method, did not give satis-\nfactory results in dealing with objectives of different nature to-\ngether. On the other hand, the multiobjective IGA and the par-\nallel IGA were both seen to be satisfactory for incorporating\nmultiple objectives, and for dealing with qualitative and quanti-\ntative design objectives, and seem to be promising approaches.\nSome of the challenges observed during experimentation in-\nclude user fatigue and human inconsistency. User inconsistency\ncan result from: the inability of the user to provide a rating con-\nsistent with ratings given for other designs; evaluation of the de-\nsign with a different perspective each time; or simply changing\nhis\/her mind. This makes qualitative convergence very difficult\nand, hence, the user must be well informed on how the ratings\nshould be given.\nUser fatigue is the inability of the designer to assess a large\nnumber of designs over a large number of generations due to\npsychological or physical exhaustion. This prevents the evalu-\nation of a large number of generations or large populations by\nthe human user. Various proposals on tackling user fatigue are\ncurrently being researched in the IEC community, and have re-\ncently been reviewed by one of us [5]. Wang and Takagi pro-\nposed a neural network-based mechanism to predict user eval-\nuation, thereby eliminating the need to involve the user in the\nBRINTRUP et al.: ERGONOMIC CHAIR DESIGN BY FUSING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CRITERIA USING IGAS 353\nevaluation of every generation [24]. A more recent development\nis the comparison of online learning within IEC using a fuzzy\nrule base, radial basis functions, and case-based reasoning by\nMachwe et al. [25]. They concluded that case-based reasoning is\nthe way forward for online learning in IEC-based optimization.\nThe current framework can be used with the multiobjective\nIGA or parallel IGA algorithms to make real-life experimenta-\ntion, where the chair shape suggested by the computer is actually\nbuilt and experienced by the user before a rating is provided.\nMultiobjective optimization design philosophy can be used\nto optimize an inclusive design that takes into account varying\nsizes in a given population of sitters and achieves a compromise\ndesign.\nThe same philosophy can be used to add further qualitative\nobjectives that separately denote the satisfaction of a number of\nusers and the expert judgment of an ergonomics designer.\nThe framework can be applied to other visual ergonomic\ndesign problems that have qualitative and quantitative\ncharacteristics.\nAn existing population of chair designs can be used as a\nstarting point, so that previous designs are used as parent\nsolutions.\nAs part of our future work, we anticipate the development of\na hybrid algorithm in which the strengths of parallel and multi-\nobjective IGA will be combined.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nBoth qualitative and quantitative views are part of the er-\ngonomic design process. However, the effective formalization\nand incorporation of both of these influences is a problem that\nstill had to be solved when we began this work.\nHere, we have proposed the IMODO framework and devel-\noped three algorithmic approaches that followed the principles\nof the framework. These are the sequential, parallel, and multi-\nobjective IGA. We selected the ergonomic chair design problem\nfor testing the framework. The results obtained from the three\nalgorithms were compared in terms of qualitative and quantita-\ntive fitness convergences, diversity of designs, and user prefer-\nences among final sets of solutions. The qualitative fitness con-\nvergence was best with multiobjective IGA, followed by par-\nallel IGA and sequential IGA. The quantitative fitness conver-\ngence was best with parallel IGA, followed by sequential IGA\nand multiobjective IGA. Users mostly preferred the results ob-\ntained from the multiobjective IGA, followed by the parallel\nIGA, while sequential IGA results were not liked at all. Diver-\nsity increased from sequential IGA to parallel IGA to multiob-\njective IGA.\nOur work provides a complementary ergonomic design\nframework that brings qualitative and quantitative aspects of er-\ngonomic design together. Future work will focus on improving\nthe framework with hybrid algorithms.\nREFERENCES\n[1] A. Brintrup, J. Ramsden, and A.
