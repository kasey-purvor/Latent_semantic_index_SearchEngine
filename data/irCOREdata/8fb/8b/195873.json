A large amount of data \nfrom diverse studies proves this perception inaccurate at best, and at worst, an impediment for further \nefforts to characterize the variation in the human genome. Since variation in genotype and environment \nare the fundamental basis to understand phenotypic variability and heritability at the population level, \nidentifying the range of human genetic variation is crucial to the development of personalized nutrition \nand medicine. The Human Variome Project (HVP; http:\/\/www.humanvariomeproject.org\/) was proposed \ninitially to systematically collect mutations that cause human disease and create a cyber infrastructure to \nlink locus specific databases (LSDB). We report here the discussions and recommendations from the \n2008 HVP planning meeting held in San Feliu de Guixols, Spain, in May 2008. \n \n \nIntroduction \n \nThe completion of the consensus sequence of the human genome (Lander, et al., 2001; Venter, et al., \n2001) ushered in the \u201cpost-genomic era\u201d of science \u2013 that is, experiments could be designed using the \nreference sequence of the genome without need for additional sequencing efforts. Subsequent \npublication of the human haplotype map, an analysis of sequence diversity in 270 individuals from 4 \nancestral populations (International HapMap Consortium, 2003, 2004; Frazer, et al., 2007), provided \nknowledge for building reagents for further genetic analyses. The knowledge and sequence information \nprovided the resources to analyze the genetic contribution to virtually all measurable phenotypes. These \nefforts and the resulting databases complemented the long-standing efforts by geneticists to locate, \nidentify, and characterize mutations that cause monogenic and polygenic diseases in humans, an effort \nbegun by McKusick and colleagues in the 1950s (reviewed in McKusick, 2006) and now catalogued in the \nOnline Mendelian Inheritance in Man (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/sites\/entrez?db=omim; Hamosh, et al., \n2005) and the Human Gene Mutation Database (http:\/\/www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk; Stenson, et al., 2008 ). \nNCBI\u2019s dbGaP (Genotype and Phenotype database - http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/gap; Mailman, et al., \n2007), HuGEnet (Human Genome Epidemiology Network - http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/genomics\/hugenet\/), EBI\u2019s \nEGA (European Genotype Archive \u2013 http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/ega\/), FINDbase (Frequency of INherited \nDisorders database; http:\/\/www.findbase.org; van Baal, et al., 2007) and GAD (the Genetic Association \nDatabase http:\/\/geneticassociationdb.nih.gov\/; Becker, et al., 2004), are repositories for data from \npopulation studies associating genetic variation with phenotypes. Most of these databases are study-\noriented and analyze existing polymorphisms rather than focusing on the discovery of new genetic \nvariants. \n \nA large amount of other mutation or gene variation data, however, is likely to exist on servers in \nlaboratories scattered throughout the world. Each of these databases may contain valuable data for other \nstudies and for the medical practitioner. The Human Variome Project (HVP; \nhttp:\/\/www.humanvariomeproject.org\/) was previously proposed to systematically collect mutations that \ncause human disease (Cotton, et al., 2007a; Cotton, et al., 2007b; Ring, et al., 2006) and create a cyber \ninfrastructure to link locus specific databases (LSDBs). Local experts would curate individual LSDBs but \neach would have similar architecture, ontologies, and data elements allowing for interoperability. Links to \nnational and international databases such as at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI - \nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI - http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/) \nwould consolidate the knowledge of the curation done by local experts. We report here the discussions \nand recommendations from the 2008 HVP planning meeting held in San Feliu de Guixols, Spain, in May \n2008, to further the development of the HVP. \n \nThe theoretical rationale for re-sequencing genes from individuals in diverse populations is that the \nexisting databases have focused primarily on Europeans and their descendants and are therefore a \nrelatively narrow subdivision of the entire range of human genetic diversity.  Published data supporting a \nHVP Planning \n  6 \nconcerted re-sequencing effort for monogenic and complex diseases come from independent and \nunlinked studies: \n \n\u2022 The molecular basis of 2393 phenotypes was known as of September 2008 \n(http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Omim\/mimstats.html). Many monogenic diseases are caused by \ndifferent mutations in one gene, and all monogenic diseases are known to have variable age of onset, \nseverity and outcome (e.g., McKusick, 2007; Ropers, 2007). Differences in monogenic disease \nphenotype may be caused by variations in location of mutations, by modifier genes that interact with \nthe disease causing allele (McKusick, 2007), and by gene-environment interactions (Ordovas and \nCorella, 2006). Characterizing causative mutations in familial and sporadic cases in diverse \npopulations is warranted for a full understanding of each disease. \n \n\u2022 The molecular basis of over 3700 other phenotypes are either suspected to be Mendelian disorders \nor are unknown (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/Omim\/mimstats.html). \n \n\u2022 Simple monogenic traits may be caused by different gene variants. The ability to hydrolyze lactose as \nan adult, which is called lactase persistence, occurs in ~30% of the world\u2019s population (Lomer, et al., \n2008). Expression of the lactase gene post-weaning has been associated with a C\/T variant at \nposition -13910 from the start of the lactase (LCT) gene in Finnish families and 236 individuals from 4 \npopulations (Germany, Italy, South Korea and Finland) (Enattah, et al., 2002). However, lactase \npersistence is associated with a different variant (G\/C at -14010 from LCT) in Kenyans, Tanzanians, \nand Sudanese (Tishkoff, et al., 2007). Other populations with higher percentages of individuals with \nlactose tolerance have not been analyzed (Montgomery, et al., 2007). Variation in amounts of lactose \nrequired to induce intestinal bloating and diarrhea, severity, and age of onset are observed in \nreference populations (lactose intolerant) and in populations where the lactase persistence variants \nare more common (Lomer, et al., 2008; Montgomery, et al., 2007). \n \n\u2022 Over 290 studies associating polymorphisms in methylene tetrahyrdofolate reductase (MTHFR) with \nvarious disease or physiological conditions have been published \n(http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/genomics\/search.htm -> MTHFR). The most studied variants are c.677C>T \n(p.A222V) and c.1298A>C (p.E429A). Marini et al (2008) recently re-sequenced 564 individuals of \ndiverse genetic ancestry (Coriell Institute panels - \nhttp:\/\/ccr.coriell.org\/Sections\/BrowseCatalog\/Populations.aspx?PgId=4) and discovered 14 \nnonsynonymous changes including 11 alleles with frequencies <1% along with the common alleles \np.A222V, p.E429A, and p.R594Q (Marini, et al., 2008). Increased levels of folate restored MTHFR \nactivity to the normal range in 4 of the 5 variants. The sequence heterogeneity and remediation of \nenzyme activity by folate supports a greater emphasis on the ~600 cofactor dependent enzymes in \nthe human proteome. Since many cofactors are derived from diet, such studies may identify \nindividuals who require higher concentrations of vitamins for optimal health. \n \nAnalyses of populations using HapMap data or their derivative reagents also provide justification for the \nneed to re-sequence genes in diverse populations. \n \n\u2022 Published HapMap data analyzed by a novel algorithm identified chromosomal regions with a high \nFst (Fixation index, a measure of population differentiation) between three ancestral populations \n(European, Chinese and African) (Myles, et al., 2008b). These regions encoded genes involved in \ncarbohydrate metabolism, skeletal development, and pigmentation. Such allele frequency differences \nmay explain, for example, the differential effect in incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes between \nEuropeans and Pima Indians who consume similar Western diets (Schulz, et al., 2006). \n \n\u2022 Twenty-five SNPs linked to 6 chronic diseases in genome wide association studies (GWAS) were \nanalyzed in ~1000 individuals from 53 populations (Myles, et al., 2008a). Several risk alleles were \nabsent from some populations and several were present at 100% frequency indicating that the allele \nmay contribute uniquely to disease in the European population. Other polymorphisms in these genes \nor in other genes within the non-European populations are likely to contribute to disease incidence \nand severity. \nHVP Planning \n  7 \n \n\u2022 Allele frequencies of 873 tag SNPs in 82 candidate genes involved in hypertension, type 2 diabetes, \nobesity, dyslipidemia or metabolic syndrome varied in 54 populations (Hancock, et al., 2008). Some \nof these genes were linked to adaptation to cold climates and others likely to selection by other \nenvironmental factors. Exposure to infectious agents such as malaria (Kwiatkowski, 2005), high \naltitude (Beall, 2007) and the food environment (Perry, et al., 2007) have also been shown to select \nfor certain genotypes. \n \n\u2022 Culture is also known to influence allele frequencies among populations. A gradient of genotypes \nexists from northwest to southeast in Europe (Price, et al., 2008). At a fine mapping level, allele \nfrequencies mirror geography, and by inference, national culture, within Europe (Lao, et al., 2008; \nNovembre, et al., 2008). \n \nVariation at the genomic and gene levels demonstrates that existing data and reagents will not be \nsufficient to identify genes involved in maintaining health or those that contribute to the incidence and \nseverity of disease. The newly initiated 1000 Genomes project (http:\/\/www.1000genomes.org), which is \nbeing organized by an international consortium, will employ genome-wide re-sequencing and targeted \ncoding region sequencing in a total of approximately 1500 individuals from three human populations: \nEuropeans, Africans, and Asians (Lang, 2008; Siva, 2008). Each of these populations will be represented \nby a number of sub populations consisting of approximately 100 individuals including Yoruba in Ibadan, \nNigeria; Japanese in Tokyo; Chinese in Beijing; Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western \nEurope; Toscani in Italy; and other populations to be determined. The goal of this international effort is to \ncharacterize alleles with frequencies of approximately 1% genome-wide and less than 1% in coding \nregions. The phenotype of individuals sequenced in the project will not be analyzed. Hence, these data \nwill be used for improving selection of reagents and designs for GWAS and will not be directly focused on \nidentification of disease causing genes. Further information is available from the project website \nreferenced above. \n \nThe Human Variome Project \n \nThe Human Variome Project differs from these other efforts in developing and fostering an international \neffort to systematically identify genes, their mutations, and their variants associated with phenotypic \nvariability and indications of human disease. The HVP is an international effort linking clinical, medical, \nand research laboratories for developing knowledge housed within linked databases. This knowledge \nwould be accessible to the research and medical communities to improve research strategies and clinical \nmedical practice. The key objectives of the project are described in Box 1. An example of the need for the \nHVP as applied to neurological disorders has recently been published (Cotton, et al., 2008). \n \nThe HVP Planning Meeting conducted concurrent meetings that discussed (i) classifying genetic variation \nfrom unlinked clinical medicine or research laboratories, (ii) capturing data from diagnostic and service \nlaboratories, (iii) assessment of pathogenicity, (iv) data transfer, (v) data integration access, (vi) funding \nand governance, (vii) emerging countries\u2019 initiative and involvement, (viii) ethics: existing and anticipated \nconcerns, (ix) attribution and publication, and (x) pilot projects (Table 1). Reports for classifying and \ncapturing genetic variation from laboratories (i.e., committee reports i and ii) have been combined for \nsake of brevity. Detailed reports for these sessions are provided in the supplementary information. Below \nare synopses of the main outcomes and recommendations. \n \nClassifying Genetic Variation from Unlinked Clinical Medicine, Research, or Service \nLaboratories \n \nThe cyber infrastructure for biological data is extensive (Stein, 2008) but still not fully integrated or \ndeveloped. The HVP is relying upon these databases for data element definition, storage, management, \nretrieval, and nomenclature. For example, the NCBI provides a gene-centric index for mutation \nnomenclature, Human Genome Organization (HUGO; http:\/\/www.hugo-international.org\/) has a naming \nscheme for genes, and the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS; http:\/\/www.hgvs.org\/; Cotton and \nHVP Planning \n  8 \nHoraitis, 2000) provides for naming of mutations. The Cancer Bionformatics Grid (caBIG - \nhttps:\/\/cabig.nci.nih.gov\/; Fenstermacher, et al., 2005) exemplifies the need for interoperability, common \nlanguages, data standards and sharing. In addition to the disease-specific (e.g., caBIG) and international \ndatabases, LSDBs in individual laboratories and institutes exist but are not easily linked to the rest of the \nbioinformatic community. \n \nWhile the data management infrastructure continues to expand, curated genetic data are scattered: no \ncoordinated effort exists to harness and harmonize these efforts, data and knowledge. Gene mutation \nand variation data are generated from and used by diagnostic, epidemiological experiments, research \nlaboratories, and clinicians, each of which has different missions, ability or willingness to curate \ninformation, and resources (Table 2). \n \nSince clinical laboratories are not required or encouraged to deposit genotype or phenotype data into \npublicly available databases, data sharing ranges from complete to none. Efforts to encourage and \ndevelop ongoing data collection have begun and range from commercial enterprises to funded grant \nprograms (Table 3). Each of these programs is developing unique solutions for the barriers of time, cost, \nconcerns of patient confidentiality, IRB requirements, maintenance of quality assurance, and difficulties in \nobtaining clinical information from referring centers. These challenges reinforce the concept that clinical \nlaboratories should not be expected to develop and curate public databases. However, clinical \nlaboratories should be expected to contribute data. Developing a standard open software suite such as \nthe Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD; http:\/\/www.lovd.nl; Fokkema, et al., 2005) for these \ninitiatives will allow existing tools, for example the Universal Mutation Database (UMD;  \nhttp:\/\/www.umd.be\/; Beroud, et al., 2000) software, to query across the cyberspace of LSDBs to retrieve \nand analyze data (Table 3). Relying upon a common database design, language and interoperability will \nenforce quality standards across clinical and research laboratories. Nevertheless, clinical and research \nlaboratories may have processes and quality measures which would require a \u201cdata warning\u201d for select \nentries or datasets. Some of the issues and requirements to initiate adoption of these ideas are described \nin Box 2. Once these individual LSDBs are developed and curated locally, ethically appropriate data \nelements can be deposited in national or international databases (NCBI or EBI). \n \nPathogenicity and Clinical Utility \n \nUnderstanding the consequences of genetic variation depends upon the simultaneous collection and \ndocumentation of phenotypic data for each variant (e.g., Cotton et al., 2007a; Crawford and Nickerson, \n2005; Kaput, 2008; Kaput et al., 2005; Ring et al., 2006; Taylor et al., 2001). The correlation between \ngenome and phenotype (pathogenicity) is the basis for the clinical benefit. The two broad principles for \nassessing pathogenicity or phenotype linked to a genetic variant are that (i) multiple data elements must \nbe integrated and (ii) data elements and the integration process must have standards, validation, \nquantification and transparency (Box 3). \n \nThe omics sciences are now capable of generating large but disparate (e.g., genomic vs metabolomic) \ndatasets that may be used in research but also clinical applications. Although assessing pathogenicity will \nbe an ongoing, iterative process, several specific recommendations are warranted: \n \nGenetic and Genomic Data. Gene marker analysis is an important step in the clinical diagnosis of \npediatric and adult genetic disorders. The issues associated with clinical genetic testing are well \nrecognized for inherited cancer syndromes, where missense variants represent 10-30% of test results \n(e.g., (Eisinger, 2008; Metcalfe, et al., 2008; Stoffel, et al., 2008)). Many of these variants are classified as \nhaving an uncertain effect unless strong genetic epidemiologic and\/or functional evidence exists \nassociating them with the syndrome. The Breast Cancer Information Consortium (BIC - \nhttp:\/\/research.nhgri.nih.gov\/bic\/) classifies BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants as pathogenic only if the \nprobability of pathogenicity, usually based on statistical genetic approaches is, definitely pathogenic \n>0.99; likely pathogenic 0.95-0.99; uncertain 0.05-0.949; likely not pathogenic\/little clinical significance \n(LCS) 0.001-0.049; neutral or LCS <0.001 (Plon et al. 2008). For other genes, there are no standards. For \neach type of data, old and new, the principles of standards, validation, quantification and transparency \napply. Many of the expected gene variants have not been identified or characterized in world populations. \nHVP Planning \n  9 \nHence, complete re-sequencing of a gene proven or suspected to be involved in monogenic and \npolygenic diseases will be required to determine causal linkages between genes and phenotype. \n \nStandardizing Existing Clinical Phenotype and Pathology. A fundamental problem with assessing \nphenotypes is the diversity of the underlying molecular pathways that cause disease, and as a \nconsequence the heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, age of onset, severity, complications, and age \nof death. Other groups (Kaput, et al., 2005; Kathiresan, et al., 2008; Makinen, et al., 2008; Rosenzweig, \net al., 2002; Wong, 2006; Zaninotto, et al., 2007) have proposed using disease as a classifier (e.g., type 2 \ndiabetes), but rely on quantitative measures of phenotype (e.g., fasting glucose, fasting insulin) as a \nmeans to reduce subjective assignments of disease (Tracy, 2008). Since the HVP seeks to collect data \nfrom laboratories and clinics, phenotype templates are needed to define ranges of (i) minimum sets of \nclinical data, (ii) range of subset data, and (iii) maximum datasets. Such hierarchical template structures \nwill allow scientists in all countries to participate in data and sample collection. Developing the \nLOVD\/UMD tools (Table 3 and below) for the HVP will also require a means to validate data and data \nquality prior to implementation across laboratories. Clinical and pathology data standards must be \ndeveloped by experts in each genetic disorder for interpreting the effects of genetic variation. \n \nStandards linking in vitro functional studies with clinical results. If a cellular function can be \nestablished that appears to correlate with the clinical syndrome, then in vitro assays could be used to \nclassify whether a variant retains or loses function. Standards for performing and interpreting the assays \nare crucial if these methods are to be accepted as a mechanism for classifying variants clinically (Couch \net al., 2008). In cancer genetics, the correlation of mismatch repair defects with Lynch syndrome \n(Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer) is probably the most well-established example (Ou et al., \n2007); even so, the principle that multiple data elements must be integrated to achieve classification \nshould be respected. \n \nComputational studies. Multiple studies in recent years have confirmed the value of comparative \nsequence analysis in helping to predict whether a missense variant is pathogenic or not (reviewed in \nTavtigian et al., 2008). However, the issues of standards, validation, and transparency also apply to \ncomputational methods. Most importantly, the quality of a multiple sequence alignment is critical to their \naccuracy (Ahola et al., 2006; Ahola et al., 2008). The choice of ortholog sequences that is used, the \nquality of cDNA or genomic data, and the methods used to construct the alignment are all important \nfeatures. \n \nComputational Studies - Predictive Algorithms. Some methods have already been validated on \ncurated data sets of variants, establishing their Negative Predictive Value (NPV, the proportion of \npredictions of \u201cneutral\u201d that are actually neutral) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV, the proportion of \npredictions of \u201cpathogenic\u201d that are actually pathogenic) (Chan et al., 2007; Chao et al., 2008). However, \nseveral of the more commonly used algorithms have been updated. Algorithms exist for coding region \nvariants and predictions of altered splice sites (Nalla and Rogan, 2005; Spurdle et al., 2008). New \nmethods, including both rule-based and machine-learning approaches, are being developed (Tavtigian et \nal., 2008), and in the future, algorithms to assess other non-coding functions of DNA are anticipated. \n \nData Transfer and Databasing - Gene and Locus Specific Databases \n \nHistorically, gene variation data were first collected for specific gene(s) causing a Mendelian disorder or a \nchange in the phenotype. These listings usually were initiated and driven by the interests of an expert \nusing the collection for research, clinical or diagnostic applications. Currently there are over 700 such \nLSDBs (http:\/\/www.hgvs.org\/dblist\/glsdb.html; Horaitis et al., 2007), mostly web accessible. Complete \ncollection and expert curation of gene sequence variants and their coupling to phenotypic consequences \n(if any), will be essential for proper future healthcare and research. Data Transfer and Databasing plans \nare outlined in Box 4. \n \n \n \n \nHVP Planning \n  10 \nIntegrating Data and Providing Access \n \nThe breadth and depth of information available about human variation are rapidly expanding as new \ntechnologies (e.g., omics and imaging) analyze health and pathogenicities. Uncomplicated methods of \naccess are needed for multiple user communities with differing expertise in genetics, clinical medicine, \nnutrition, physiology, and probably the public. Information generated by the HVP will have many of those \ndimensions, ranging from how variants are identified, the type of variant, the physiological parameters \nassociated with the variant, and where and how records are maintained and accessed. For example, \ninformation for rare variants, SNPs, microsatellites, small insertions\/deletions will range from reports of \none variant in one individual, such as might be gathered from manual data entry and maintained in \nmedical records, to large-scale screening of thousands of genomes in defined populations. How the data \nare represented will be a challenge since information will come from published literature or text-rich \nresources such as OMIM or GeneReviews (http:\/\/www.geneclinics.org\/profiles\/all.html; Pagon et al., \n2002), include explicit records in LSDBs and\/or genome-wide resources such as dbSNP or genome \nbrowsers. The scope of the data, which includes locations of variants on reference sequences to \nphenotypes in humans and model organisms, increases the dimensionality. Hence, the scale of \ninformation for human genetic variation and linked phenotype can range from a single text document to \npetabytes of raw data derived from sequencing thousands of genomes to a high level of coverage and \naccuracy. Model databases capable of accessing known variants will be developed from pilot projects \nand provide a resource for clinicians, patient advocates, and the public (i.e., education). \n \nAccessing known variants. Given the dimensionality issues and the challenges they represent, the HVP \nwill help develop an infrastructure to identify variants relative to a reference standard and allow facile \nlinking of data with appropriate tools. Notification schemes would be developed to indicate missing data \nfor each variant. The HVP is identifying a progression of doable tasks with milestones for each. For \nexample, the HVP will link with one such effort, the on-going collaboration among GEN2PHEN \n(http:\/\/www.gen2phen.org), EBI, and NCBI to develop an international set of standard Locus Specific \nGenomic Sequence reference (LRGS\/RefSeqGene - \nhttp:\/\/www.gen2phen.org\/docs\/LRG_Specification_Summary_version_9.pdf). With that foundation in \nplace, active LSDBs can report their variants in LRG\/RefSeqGene coordinates to centralized databases \n(EBI\/NCBI) to be accessioned to dbSNP (http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/projects\/SNP\/; Sherry et al., 2001). \nThe scope of information to be centralized requires further debate, but could include items described in \nBox 5. The HVP will ensure that other standards in addition to the reference sequence are developed \nand\/or used, such as human gene nomenclature (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC); \nhttp:\/\/www.genenames.org; Bruford et al., 2008), variant nomenclature (Human Genome Variation \nSociety; http:\/\/www.hgvs.org\/mutnomen; den Dunnen and Antonarakis, 2001), variant accessions \n(dbSNP) and names for diseases or diagnostic tests in medical records (Logical Observation Identifier \nNames and Codes, LOINC; e.g., McDonald et al., 2003). Reference gene-specific standards to support \nLSDBs and genetic testing groups (see http:\/\/www.gen2phen.org and \nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/RefSeq\/RSG) are under development. In addition, assigning accessions in \ndbSNP to known variants, either directly to dbSNP or Ensembl (http:\/\/www.ensembl.org), or with \nPhenCode (http:\/\/phencode.bx.psu.edu; (Giardine et al., 2007)) serving as a data collection center are \nbeing implemented. \n \nPublic education. With the understanding that large data sets are only as useful as their ease of access, \nthe HVP can also foster portal sites to help direct users to tools and resources of interest, and identify \nareas requiring additional development. Tutorials comparing and contrasting different resources might \nalso be commissioned. Topics that must be addressed are how to access information in the published \nliterature, the effect of variation on transcription, the significance of conserved non-coding regions on \nphenotypic variation, identification of mRNA splice sites, descriptions on the structure and maintenance of \nLSDBs, and strategies for interpreting the impact of single (e.g., SNPs) and multiple (e.g., haplotypes) \nvariants in one allele or in multiple alleles on the phenotype of interest. The HVP intends to make greater \nefforts to educate the public about the project\u2019s importance and the benefits of research participation. \n \n \n \nHVP Planning \n  11 \nAttribution and Publication \n \nA major barrier to the development of comprehensive analyses of human genetic variation, and therefore \nLSDBs, is the reward system for clinicians and academic researchers. Non-academic clinicians typically \nreceive little or no credit for contributing to the scientific literature, and academic clinicians and basic \nresearchers cannot easily persuade journals to publish the 50th variant of a gene that has an observable \neffect on phenotype. These cultures may be difficult to change overnight, but specific steps could be \ninstituted immediately to promote the submission of genotype \u2013 phenotype data to LSDBs and to \u201creward\u201d \ncontributions to team projects. Database entries could be a mandatory quality control standard for clinical \nlaboratories and clinicians. For researchers, a publication or web-based system establishing micro-\nattribution and community annotation of mutations (e.g., http:\/\/www.wikigenes.org) and cited data will \nenable measurable contributions to the scientific knowledge base (Editorial, 2008; Hoffmann, 2008). \nSimilarly, database-journals would also serve this task by providing a forum for publishing gene variation \ndata that would be eventually deposited in the PubMed literature database. One such journal, the open \naccess Human Genomics and Proteomics (HGP; http:\/\/www.sage-hindawi.com\/journals\/hgp), which is \naffiliated with FINDbase, will focus on studies characterizing causative mutation and\/or biomarker \nfrequency spectra. Accepted contributions including datasets will be linked in FINDbase and deposited in \nPubMed (Patrinos and Petricoin, 2009). Journals, tenure and promotion committees, and funding \nagencies would be encouraged to cite these contributions to and citations of LSDB and international \nnational databases (Patrinos and Brookes, 2005). The HVP recommends that researchers cite these \nattributions and citations in their curricula vitae to foster the transition of the academic culture. The same \ntrend and recommendations for development of coherent tools are valid for the recognition of contribution \nto the setting, use and sharing of any bioresource such as biobanks (Cambon-Thomsen, 2003; \nKauffmann and Cambon-Thomsen, 2008) and international efforts like P3G are being developed in the \nsame spirit. (Knoppers, et al. 2008) \n \nDeveloping \/ Emerging Countries \u2013 Ensuring a Worldwide Collection \n \nAlthough ~90% of known SNPs are shared between Asians, Europeans and Africans, 80% of private \nSNPs are found within Asian and Africans (Hinds, et al., 2005; Jorde and Wooding, 2004). The recent \nsequencing of the Watson (Wheeler, et al., 2008), Venter (Levy, et al., 2007), Kriek \n(http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2008\/05\/080526155300.htm), West African (Bentley et al., 2008) \nand Han Chinese (Wang et al., 2008) genomes, along with gene specific re-sequencing efforts (see \nIntroduction), suggest that a large number of SNPs and other sequence variation exists in the human \npopulation. Estimates from African genetic diversity and the Pan Asian SNP initiative suggest that 80 to \n90% of human genomic variation resides in the world\u2019s emerging countries. Any formal attempt to identify \nthe extent of genomic variation must include geographical regions which have not been included in \nhaplotype mapping projects. Although the Population Reference Sample (POPRES) will address some of \nthese missing populations (Nelson et al., 2008), this effort is designed as a mapping project, not one \nfocused on functional polymorphisms or mutations. Hence, the main focus of the HVP effort is the \ninclusion and analyses of clinical samples from diverse ethnic groups. \n \nThe distinct advantage of some ethnic populations is the opportunity to study genetic diseases due to \nconsanguinity, large family size, and potential founder effects (e.g., Bittles 2001; Bittles 2002; Saadallah \nand Rashed, 2007). Emerging nations will be regarded as major contributors to the VARIOME project. \nHowever, biomedical research has not been the focus of resource poor countries even though such \nactivities are likely to produce economic and health benefits for all (Daar et al., 2002; Singer and Daar, \n2001). Education of healthcare providers, the public, and government officials is needed for \ndemonstrating the universal nature of the HVP, the need to include populations in developing countries, \nand the benefits from cooperating in biomedical research (Bhan et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2008; Seguin \net al., 2008; Tindana et al., 2007). Certain populations may mistrust research involving genetic analyses \nor fear that results can be misused to support discrimination or worse \n(http:\/\/www.eubios.info\/ASIAE\/BIAE201.htm): Malay-Muslims, Chinese, and Indians in Singapore \nexpressed anxiety about breach of confidentiality, the misuse of their DNA for cloning, and possibilities of \nbeing diagnosed with disease (Wong et al., 2004). Community based participatory research \nHVP Planning \n  12 \ncollaborations may provide forums for addressing cultural and ethical concerns of biomedical research \n(McCabe-Sellers et al., 2008). \n \nAnalyzing the extent of human genomic variation creates an ideal opportunity for the developed and the \ndeveloping nations of the world to forge meaningful partnerships and to work together in an \nunprecedented way, initially to identify variation causing disease, and then to understand how general \nvariation contributes to human phenotypic diversity. By ensuring that all nations and ethnic groups have \nan equal and fair opportunity to share data and technology, we will provide evidence-based information \nthat all populations can benefit from a global society health network. The primary objectives for including \npopulations in emerging countries are described in Box 6. \n \nThe HVP appreciates the genomic sovereignty\/equality for all countries to be involved in the Human \nVariome Project and acknowledges the value of \u2018human capital\u2019 within all populations. Real and tangible \nbenefits of the HVP to improve health will be generated for participating populations; the voluntary \nparticipation of the greatest number of countries would ensure a more general applicability and it is hoped \nthat many countries will decide to participate. \n \nProgress in Developing Ethical Guidelines for LSDBs: Principles to Practice to \nImplementation \n \nEthical issues remain of vital concern to the Human Variome Project. Participating researchers are \ncommitted to adhering to the highest ethical principles governing research, data sharing and ultimately \nenabling this new knowledge to benefit all of humanity as much as possible. Ethical guidelines specifically \nfor LSDBs were previously published (Cotton et al., 2005). \n \nLSDBs may contain a large amount of phenotypic data. Most LSDBs post a considerable amount of data \non public websites and increasingly this information may be accessible through genome browsers. While \nthe best intention of the HVP is to ensure that participants are acknowledged as a group, without any risk \nof identification, a specific challenge occurs in the case of rare mutations associated with distinctive \nclinical features. Since epistatic and environment interactions (reviewed in Kaput, 2008) alter age of \nonset, severity, complications and outcomes for monogenic and polygenic phenotypes, it may be \nnecessary to analyze entire genomes for personalized healthcare. Such polygenic analyses generate \ndata that could be used for re-identifying individual patients (Craig et al., 2008). \n \nOther ethical concerns may be minimized by improving communication about the project and its goals \nthrough multiple channels such as print and broadcast media, local community outreach, and internet \nsources such as the HGVS website. The HVP will develop an ethics review committee with a \nsubcommittee focused on issues related to LSDB for (i) providing counsel when dilemmas arise, (ii) \noverseeing guidelines, (iii) identifying best practices, (iv) determining how best to ensure privacy in all \nsituations, (v) formulating how to handle data for which explicit consent does not exist or is not possible to \nachieve, and (vi) developing a consent form that is consistent for all LSDBs but which can be adapted to \nthe requirements of individual countries. Such consent would contain, for example, a re-contact clause. \nThe specific recommendation and open questions are outlined in Box 7. \n \nThe HVP, through its Ethics Working Group, is committed to (i) soliciting, collecting and analyzing consent \nforms in order to develop a model consent form that can provide greater consistency across all LSDBs, \n(ii) seeking the input of relevant clinical genetic societies for comment, and (iii) using that input to develop \nethical standards for LSDBs. \n \nFunding Mechanisms and Governance \n \nFunding for collecting data of mutations causing single gene disorders has traditionally been difficult due \nto the extreme fragmentation of the field even though mutations affect 60% of all individuals in a lifetime \n(Baird, et al., 1988). The funding possibilities are more likely if the international HVP is treated as a \nconcerted effort. Given the limitations of existing knowledge (see Introduction and Patrinos and Brookes, \nHVP Planning \n  13 \n2005), this initiative will benefit research in many fields and impact prevention and clinical care of disease. \nSpecific focus areas for developing funding streams are described in Box 8. \n \nGovernance. Those dedicated to assisting themselves and others in their clinics by collecting \nmutation\/variants causing inherited disease have in the past acted in isolation; reinventing wheels wastes \nfunds and time. The HGVS, formerly HUGO-MDI, was formed to alleviate this problem and accelerate the \ncollection and management of information on mutation causing disease(s). The HVP was named and \ninitiated to define the aims of this activity (Melbourne in 2006) by an extremely high profile group of \nexperts in all types of genetic variation analyses. The Genomic Disorders Research Center (Melbourne, \nAustralia;  http:\/\/www.genomic.unimelb.edu.au) was voted as coordinating office, to continue its function \nof facilitating independent projects started at the inception of the centre in 1996. In association with world \nexperts, Deloitte (http:\/\/www.deloitte.com) developed a business plan, which was approved by the HVP \nPlanning Group. The HVP Planning Meeting was a designated activity of this plan and other sections of \nthe plan will follow (e.g. board function to oversee the coordinating office\u2019s function and support it). The \nbusiness plan calls for a broadly defined community of interested stakeholders to develop the HVP (Box \n9). \n \nOpen questions that must be resolved in future meetings are (i) the extent of data sharing between \npatient records and research databases, (ii) appropriate descriptions of data elements, and (iii) data \nownership and confidentiality. \n \nPilot Projects \n \nThe HVP has established a partnership with the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary \nTumors (InSiGHT; http:\/\/www.insight-group.org) to collect and classify a large set of missense variants \nassociated with hereditary colorectal cancer. This effort will develop HVP\u2019s prototype system for \ninterpreting variants observed in clinical genetic testing (Box 10). InSiGHT consists of a multidisciplinary \nscientists focused particularly on the Mendelian disorders predisposing to colorectal cancer (Familial \nAdenomatous Polyposis, Lynch Syndrome and MUTYH related polyposes). This effort is an ongoing \nproject but also a model or pilot for the HVP. InSiGHT has conducted several multidisciplinary studies of \nHereditary Non Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC) patients that (i) require the development of a disease-\nspecific model for integrating databases across laboratories, (ii) establish standards for data consistency \nfor phenotypes (which include graphic pedigrees), (iii) address confidentiality, and (iv) develop a template \nfor consent. Clinicians from multiple countries and regions are contributing and committing to the \ndevelopment of these systems. Some of these issues cross disciplinary boundaries and are being \naddressed by other committees of the HVP. The InSiGHT consortium\u2019s roadmap includes providing \naccess to clinicians, a vital resource that will serve patients in the immediate future, and as a model for \nother genes and phenotypes. Among the first efforts involved uploading large datasets of mismatch repair \nvariants generated by national consortia and laboratories into the InSiGHT MMR, a LSDB which uses the \nLOVD platform. Data transfer into a mirrored central database (e.g., NCBI or EBI) is also planned with an \ninitial reciprocal agreement with the Health Data Integration project at the Australian CSIRO Centre \n(http:\/\/www.ict.csiro.au\/HAIL\/Abstracts\/2004\/UmaSrinivasan.htm). Other pilot projects are described in \nBox 11. \n \nDiscussion \n \nThe vision of the HVP, to catalogue and access all information related to human disease variation, is \nambitious. One can conceptualize the challenge as a multi-dimensional, fluid matrix, with all ~20,000 \ngenes as column headings and rows of potentially thousands of variants as descriptors. In addition, third \nand further dimensions would annotate other biological parameters, for example clinical and\/or metabolic \nphenotype, microarray expression, proteomics, protein interactions, nutrient intakes, physical activity, and \nother functional phenotypic and epidemiological data. Separate dimensions that must be linked to these \nvariants are the main effect of gene \u2013 environment interactions (e.g., Lim et al., 2007). These data \nelements relate to the cells in the initial two dimensional matrix since each may affect the genetic \nexpression of the mutation or gene variant. These dimensions are domains of knowledge that must be \nintegrated for understanding biological processes. \nHVP Planning \n  14 \n \nA predetermined bioinformatics structure to accommodate this matrix with forced fields for data entry is \nnotionally appealing but practically impossible. The reality is that LSDBs, which capture the core \ninformation in any one of these domains of information, are developed by experts and curated with \ninvaluable skill and experience. To force any change on these individual efforts would risk inestimable \nloss of activity by the curators and threaten data of individuals in populations. The challenge then is to \nintegrate the existing and developing information within existing databases and public resources into a \nsystem based on this matrix of domains \u2013 the vision of the HVP. \n \nThe task of developing \u201csuper searching\u201d software to interrogate the global information and relate it \nacross the HVP matrix in a user-friendly fashion for enquiry represents a bioinformatics challenge already \nembraced by the numerous national projects (e.g., Stein, 2008). This challenge can be met with \nresources applied to software development or existing applications that allow searches to locate all \ninformation across all domains of the international data matrix. Hansen\u2019s SRS (sequence retrieval \nsystem) approach (http:\/\/e-hrc.net\/hdi\/), or the novel Genome Commons Navigator (Brenner, 2007), \nsupported the Berkeley Computational Biology Center (http:\/\/ccb.berkeley.edu\/ccb\/index.html), both \ntarget this concept. The Navigator also seeks to provide algorithms for potential interpretation of \npathogenicity. \n \nThe approaches presented at the HVP planning meeting contribute to this goal of integrating biological \ninformation. The HVP efforts are also consistent with the newly emerging initiative to develop standards \nfor scientific disciplines and research strategies: the MIBBI Project (minimal reporting guidelines for \nbiological and biomedical investigations; Taylor, 2007; Taylor et al., 2008). The challenge to catalogue \nand access this vast body of information relating to human biology and behavior is immense, but the HVP \nis leading this endeavor through international collaborations and harmonized protocols. The development \nof this network of LSDBs and the knowledge they generate and maintain will be beneficial not only for the \ngenetic research community, but also for researchers in nutrition, toxicology, teratology, physiology \u2013 \nvirtually all biological research arenas, but perhaps most importantly for the translation of basic research \nfor improving personal and public health. The future is indeed exciting. \n \n \nDisclaimer \n \nThis work includes contributions from, and was reviewed by, the FDA.

Capture and archive all human gene variation associated with human disease in a central \nlocation with mirror sites in other countries. Data governance will ensure security and integrity \nthrough the use of auditing and security technologies but nevertheless allow searching across all \ngenes using a common interface. \n2. Provide a standardized system of gene variation nomenclature, reference sequences and support \nsystems that will enable diagnostic laboratories to use and contribute to total human variation \nknowledge. \n3. Establish systems that ensure adequate curation of human variation knowledge from gene \nspecific (locus specific), country specific, or disease specific database perspective to improve \naccuracy, reduce errors and develop a comprehensive data set comprising all human genes. \n4. Facilitate the development of software to collect and exchange human variation data in a \nfederation of gene specific (locus specific), country specific, disease specific and general \ndatabases. \n5. Establish a structured and tiered mechanism that clinicians can use to determine the health \noutcomes associated with genetic variation. This will work as a dialogue between those who use \nhuman variation data and those who provide them. Clinicians will be encouraged to provide data \nand will have open access to complete variation data. \n6. Create a support system for research laboratories that provides for the collection of genotypic and \nphenotypic data together using the defined reference sequence in a free, unrestricted and open \naccess system and create a simple mechanism for logging discoveries. \n7. Develop ethical standards to ensure open access to all human variation data that are to be used \nfor global public good and address the needs of \u201cindigenous\u201d communities under threat of dilution \nin emerging countries. \n8. Provide support to developing countries to build capacity and to fully participate in the collection, \nanalysis and sharing of genetic variation information. \n9. Establish a communication and education program to collect and spread knowledge related to \nhuman variation knowledge to all countries of the world. \n10. Continue to carry out research within the opportunities presented by investigation of human \ngenetic variation and to present these findings to users of this information for the benefit of all. \n \n \n \n \n \nBox 2 \nDeveloping Interoperable Clinical and Research Locus Specific Databases \n \n1. Security, consent and ethical approval \n2. Develop standards and guidelines for diagnostic laboratories to address database contribution \n3. Develop quality standards for genotypes and their interpretation \n4. Develop recommendations for formats for submission of data \n5. Provide models for collecting clinical information \n6. Provide recommendation for funding for database efforts, including bioinformatics \n7. Scalability: can small databases readily handle the output from next generation sequencers? \n8. Laboratory pipeline from instruments to database (LIMS : Database interface) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHVP Planning \n  26 \nBox 3 \nStandards, Validation, Quantification and Transparency \n \n1. Standards - How data (including clinical, demographic, pathologic, genetic, lifestyle and \nenvironment, computational, and laboratory) are collected, recorded, and utilized should be \nstandardized so that results are as unambiguous as possible to users. \n \n2. Validation - Before conclusions are drawn, new types of data should be compared with validated \nsets of variants that are known to be (or are highly likely to be) pathogenic and neutral, \nrespectively. \n \n3. Quantification - Uncertainty exists around all of the data types described above.  That \nuncertainty should be quantified as best as possible.  When properly quantified, results from all \ndata can be combined to produce a final probability that a variant is pathogenic. \n \n4. Transparency - Uncertainty can best be addressed when the source and quality of all data are \nknown.  Understanding genetic variation will be an ongoing, iterative process.  Proper reporting of \na conclusion regarding pathogenicity will require disclosure of all data sources, their quality, the \nmethods of combining them, and the date of the conclusion. \n \n \n \nBox 4 \nData Transfer & Databasing Standards for LSDB \n \n1. Develop a program to recruit curators of LSDBs who have yet to join the HVP. \n \n2. LSDBs will be standardized and use freely available and compatible software packages such as \nUniversal Media Disc (UMD) or Leiden Open Source Variation Database (LOVD). \n \n3. Develop standard formats for published data by disseminating rules for LSDB submission to \njournals. A new standard of publication should call for as much phenotypic data as possible. \nSimilarly, funding agencies should require submission of all gene variant data resulting from their \nsupport. \n \n4. LSDBs should develop and follow quality standards that are measureable and transparent. The \nHGVS should develop a quality label for LSDBs following all standards. \n \n5. To ensure permanent access, LSDBs should share a copy of their data to central repositories \n(e.g. HGVS, NCBI, EBI, Gen2Phen). In addition, to improve easy access, LSDBs should consider \nautomated data exchanges in real time with continuously funded national databases (NCBI, EBI). \n \n6. LSDBs can include data from expression or other in vitro functional studies, but these data should \nbe clearly marked as in vitro. \n \n7. New LSDBs are needed for every gene related to a Mendelian disorder. Lost or abandoned \nLSDBs should be revived. HGVS and the Gen2Phen consortium could play an active role here, \nsoliciting new curators as well as finding financial support. Duplication of effort should be avoided, \nbut if it occurs, LSDBs with common genes and variants should share data and entries. \n \n8. An internationally acceptable database policy statement, covering ethical and privacy issues for \ngene variant and phenotype data collection and sharing, is urgently needed. \n \n \n \n \nHVP Planning \n  27 \nBox 5 \nData Elements for LSDB \n \n1. HGVS name and historical name(s) of the variant \n2. Data submitter (LSDB or individual researcher) \n3. URL back to data submitter per variant \n4. PubMed UIDs associated with the variant \n5. Number of observations of a variant \n6. MIM number of the disease(s) or phenotype(s) of interest \n7. MIM number of the allele of interest \n8. Clinical interpretation \n9. Clinical or research groups testing for this variant \n \n \nBox 6 \nEmerging Populations: Objectives for Inclusion \n \n1. Develop procedures to include neglected, under-resourced clinicians\/researchers in emerging \ncountries, by creating networks among those of common interest. \n \n2. Recognize the need and challenges for recruiting participants.  Considerable resources are \nneeded to ensure an adequate consenting process as well as data collection, both of which can \nbe cumbersome. \n \n3. Ensure that the databases and software suite of tools that are being used or developed can be \nutilized by those in an under-capacitated environment, and that the software pipelines transfer \ngenotype data easily between clinic and laboratory (e.g. Locus Specific Databases [LSDB]). \n \n4. Researchers and their academic institutions will develop an infrastructure in anticipation of the \nCoordinating Centre working with international organizations (UN, UNICEF, WHO, OECD) to \ncreate a framework to facilitate interactions with national governments and regional organizations \nsuch as NEPAD (New Programme for Africa\u2019s Development) downward through national \ngovernments, their Departments of Health, Education, Science and Technology, amongst others. \n \n5. To ensure that ethical, legal, religious and social issues of emerging countries are considered in \nall portals of the HVP. The HVP will enlist the regulatory\/policy arm of WHO\/UN to acknowledge \nand deal with issues pertinent to Economic, Educational, Ethical, Legal and Social Issues. \n \n6. To foster communication, interaction and research networks between the developing and the \ndeveloped countries. \n \n7. To keep abreast of new analytical methods that may impact or influence the ability to maintain \nconfidentiality of data. \n \n \n \nBox 7 \nEthics Sub-Group Recommendations and Remaining Issues \n \n1. Develop a Common Ethical Framework that governs all aspects of the HVP. This guideline will \nensure strict privacy protection for all participants and provide guidance for optimizing informed \nconsent. It will strive to ensure wide access and information sharing, global benefit sharing, while \npreserving individual country norms, guidelines, and legal requirements. It will establish a clear \nbasis on which to protect individuals, families, and communities from harm. \n \nHVP Planning \n  28 \n2. Curation and all communications about work involved in a particular LSDB must be transparent \nand clear as to the nature, purpose and limits of that particular LSDB. \n \n3. Different types of data must be handled in ethically appropriate manners; including prospective, \npublished and archived data. All data must, furthermore, be handled according to the conditions \nunder which consent was originally obtained, and privacy strictly maintained (see footnote). \n \n4. Ideally, donors should be informed when their data is being transmitted to a LSDB and to the \nWeb. However, difficulties in achieving this goal arise.  Is consent required prior to transmission? \nWhat is the ethically appropriate way to handle this requirement when consent is not possible (no \nre-contact clause, impossible to re-contact, or an individual has died. If consent for transmission \nwas not part of the original consent, must re-contact occur to obtain consent? If consent is not \nobtained is it unethical to transmit even anonymized data, or particular types of anonymized data \nsuch as that governing smaller more easily identified populations\/individuals?). \n \n5. What constitutes appropriate consent for prospective data collection?  \n \n6. How ought data which is not tied to consent be handled? That is, in the absence of explicit \napproval or refusal can data be used and if so, ought it to be de-identified or anonymized, or not \nused? \n \n7. Is access to deceased individuals\u2019 information ethically appropriate? Is familial consent required if \nindividuals did not authorize access prior to their death? \n \n8. In fostering standardization, there is a need to consistently define \u2018de-identified\u2019 and \u2018anonymized\u2019 \nand ensure consistent use across the LSDBs. \n \n9. Create an Ethics Review Committee that can ensure that the HVP adheres to the utmost ethical \nprinciples as well as serve as counsel in the event of issues in need of resolution. For example, \nthe Committee could determine whether rare mutations ought to have more stringent protections \nthan common mutations. \n \n10. Ensure strict protection of privacy in cases of rare mutations in rare disease or unique \ncombinations of clinical features, where identification of individuals is at risk. \n \n11. Ensure against harms to vulnerable individuals or groups of individuals, including groups defined \non the basis of data findings. \n \n12. Disclosure of additional data, even for clinical reasons to medical professionals, cannot occur \nunless prior authorization given by donor in original consent. \n \n13. Define conditions for removal from database. \n \n14. Virtual or actual medical relationships with an enquirer are unwise and are discouraged (e.g., a \ncompany or person who performs the genetic test should not provide advice on the use of the \nresults). \n \n15. Determine the appropriate limits to access within LSDBs to prevent individual identification. (ex. \nOught parts of the LSDB be password protected?) \n \n16. Consider ethical issues arising from transferring data from LSDB to web browsers; refer to the \nEthics Committee for consensus building. \n \n \nBox 8 \nDevelopment of Justifications for Funding \nHVP Planning \n  29 \n \n1. Focus on scientific questions and hypotheses that can be addressed using the variome database. \nFor example, finding out what proportion of cases in each single gene disorder have unexpected \nphenotype(s) due to presumably modifier genes will require substantially reduced effort when \ncollection is complete, up-to-date and easily accessible, and this information will be available at \nall geographical locations. Provide a flow of data from patient via clinician\/laboratory and curator \nto central browsers\/databases will be automated and seamless. \n \n2. Both gene specific and disease specific programs can be developed when applying for funding \n(i.e. the InSiGHT colon cancer project). \n \n3. Develop plans for grant applications for all venues. For examples, applications to international, \nnational, state or province or department, country health departments; research agencies (e.g. \nNIH, NCI, MRC, NHMRC, EC, OECD); charitable organizations, foundations,  philanthropic trusts \nand individuals; companies interested in data management and sequence data acquisition. Many \nof these efforts can be pursued in parallel. Successful applications will provide leverage for \nadditional ones. \n \n4. Demonstrate feasibility and productivity of approaches before application (pilot projects). The \nmost notable at present is the InSiGHT collaboration and the \u201cAdopt a gene\u201d approach. \n \n5. Lobby for general support of the HVP as well as for individual grants. \n \n6. Proceed with systematical implementation of the Adopt a Gene approach, which has now been \ninitiated, for funding of curators. \n \n \nBox 9 \nHVP Governing Plan to Be Developed with Stakeholders \n \n1. Examine overall governance strategy outside the facilitating activities of the coordinating office. \n \n2. Examine the potential use of the term Human Variome Programme to be applied to all variation \nactivities outside the initial remit of the Human Variome Project as initiated in Melbourne.  For \nexample, the utility of the datasets for genome wide association studies, HapMap projects, \ndiagnostics for personalized nutrition and medicine. \n \n3. Evaluate the need for a term or body such as the Human Variome Organisation (HUVO) and \nexamine whether Human Proteome Organization (HUPO - http:\/\/www.hupo.org\/) is a satisfactory \nmodel both for the \u201cHVProgramme\u201d and HVProject\u201d. \n \n4. Define HVP projects and HVP collaborating projects. The first example of a collaboration project \nwill be with the InSiGHT consortium. \n \n5. Develop draft criteria for new HVP initiatives. \n \n6. Develop a HVP international consortium after piloting a project in Australia. \n \n7. Develop a Governance\/Strategic working group from the Planning Group and others. \n \n8. Encourage standards in the various facets of the HVP and harmonization if this is not possible. \n \n9. Encourage the development of miniature devices for complete genome sequencing. \n \n \n \nHVP Planning \n  30 \nBox 10 \nThe InSiGHT Committee Description and Plans for the Prototype HVP Pilot \n \nThe problem of interpreting the pathogenicity of missense variants is most commonly encountered in \ngenetic testing for cancer predisposition syndromes. Genetic testing is commonly performed for \nHereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC, Lynch Syndrome), which results from inherited \npathogenic mutations in at least four genes responsible for DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR). Between 15-\n30% of MMR variants detected during genetic testing for Lynch syndrome are missense, and most are \nrare and not interpretable regarding pathogenicity (Peltomaki and Vasen, 1997). InSiGHT has established \ncommittees addressing phenotype, curation, virtual histology, and funding, which provide advice and \nsupport for the Interpretation Committee comprised of experts ranging from clinicians to basic scientists. \nIts two short-term goals are to (i) produce a paper discussing standards for data types, classification, and \nintegration and (ii) convene to classify as many variants as possible from various international MMR gene \nmutation databases. The InSiGHT Interpretation Committee is undertaking the following actions: \n \n1. Consolidation of multiple MMR gene databases \n2. Assessment quality standards for phenotypic data, including tumor phenotype \n3. Establishment of standards for clinical, epidemiologic, and pathologic data \n4. Formation of standards for in vitro assays \n5. Standardization and quality assurance methods for computational data and methods \n6. Validation of methods for integrating these multiple data sources \n7. Using databases to organize data and allowing access to the biomedical community \n \n \n \nBox 11 \nOther Pilot Projects \n \n1. Kuwait (http:\/\/www.al-mulla.org\/) established a Molecular Genetics Diagnostic Service Division, \nintegrated within a research laboratory, which is focused on delivering state-of-the-art diagnostic \nservice for the Kuwaiti population. These services provide the research laboratory with a unique \nopportunity to meet probands with various genetic diseases. \n \n2. The Danish National HNPCC system has had 12 months\u2019 experience through the web-based, but \nclosed Danish Health Data Network (www.sundhed.dk). This model is relevant for all genetic \ndiseases. A lesson to date here is that systems are successful where the output improves the \nuser\u2019s activity and efficiency. \n \n3. Systems to support public and personal health in nutrition is being developed through two \ninternational nutrigenomics consortia for type 2 diabetes and micronutrient genetics (websites \nwithin http:\/\/www.nugo.org, free registration). These efforts introduce a nutritional domain in the \ndata matrix that relate variants of the relevant genes to nutrition profiles. \n \n4. The Rare Metabolic Disease database (RAMEDIS http:\/\/www.ramedis.de ) serves the needs of \nspecialist metabolic centres, including their clinical management, and provides access for an \nunderstanding of normal biological processes often first informed by the study of these rare \ndisorders. These too could be linked into the broader HVP plan. The interface of microarray \nexpression data into the HVP plan offers yet another very challenging data dense domain, which \nwill need careful interpretation with respect to its utility in clinical medicine. \n \n \n"}
