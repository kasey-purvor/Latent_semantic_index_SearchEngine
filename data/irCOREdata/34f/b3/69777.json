Bacterial production was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and HNAN bacterivory by the uptake of fluorescently labelled bacteria. Bacterial abundance, biomass and production ranged from 2 to 8 x 108 l-1, 13 to 64 \u00b5g C l-1 and 8 to 14 \u00b5g C l-1 d-1, respectively, with maximum values recorded in mid January. The HNAN community comprised choanoflagellate, non-collared and colonial taxa, with non-collared forms dominating abundance and biomass in late January and early February. Total HNAN abundance and biomass ranged from 1.6 to 4.2 x 106 l-1 and 8 to 16 \u00b5g C l-1, respectively. HNAN cellular ingestion and clearance rates differed between taxa with maximum rates of 8.28 particles cell-1 h-1 and 9.32 nl cell-1 h-1 recorded for large non-collared forms.

Grazing Production Antarctic \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of heterotrophic microbial processes \nto the structure and functioning of marine planktonic \necosystems is now well established (Azam et  al. 1983, \nFenchel 1988). Bactenoplankton populations are  abun- \ndant and productive across a range of environments \nand may consume up to 60 % of primary production via \ndissolved organic matter (Cole et al. 1988, Ducklow & \nCarlson 1992, Simon et al. 1992). The magnitude of this \nbacterial production and its significance to planktonic \ncarbon and energy flow has given rise to considerable \ninterest in the factors controlling and limiting the \ngrowth and mortality of bacterial populations (Billen \net al. 1990, Berninger et al. 1991b, Ducklow 1992, \nSanders et  al. 1992, Gas01 & Vaques 1993, Pace & Cole \n1994). Amongst the latter, grazing by heterotrophic \nnanoflagellate protists (HNAN) is considered to be a \nmajor loss process, and can often balance bacterial \nproduction (Pace 1988, Berninger et  al. 1991a, Sherr & \nSherr 1994); however, bacterivory by other protists \nand viral-induced lysis may also be significant (Sherr \n& Sherr 1994, Fuhrman & Nobel 1995). \nAlthough the majority of studies investigating marine \nplanktonic microbial communities have focused on \ntemperate water environments, abundant bacterial and \nHNAN populations have been observed in both coastal \nand oceanic Antarctic environments, suggesting that \nthe structure and function of microheterotrophic com- \nmunities may be similar in both temperate and polar \nenvironments (Garrison & Gowing 1993, Karl 1993). \nBacterial activity in Antarctic waters can also be  signif- \nO Inter-Research 1996 \nResale of full article not permitted \nMar Ecol Prog Set 142: 3-17, 1996 \nicant, at least during summer months, with production dinoflagellate herbivory (Archer et al. 1996). In this \nvalues of up to 17 pg C I-' d-l (Ducklow & Gal-lson 1992, study, HNAN grazing rates were determined from the \nKarl 1993). However, information on protist grazing uptake of fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) concur- \nrates from polar waters are rare and to date no mea- rently with measurements of bacterial production by \nsurements of HNAN bacterivory have been undertaken radioactive thymidine incorporation. \nconcurrently with estimates of bacterial production. \nThe importance of HNAN in controlling and limiting \nbacterial production in these cold and highly seasonal MATERIALS AND METHODS \nenvironments therefore has to be assessed. \nThe aim of this study was to determine the grazing Study site. Seven experiments were undertaken at \nimpact of the HNAN community on bacterioplankton approximately weekly intervals from 30 December \nduring summer months at a shallow water coastal loca- 1993 to 11 February 1994 during ice-free conditions \ntion in Prydz Bay, eastern Antarctica. The coastal at a site approximately 1 km offshore from the Aus- \nwaters of Prydz Bay are characterised by an annual tralian Antarctic station of Davis (68\" 34.5' S, 77\" 58.0' E; \ncycle of sea ice formation and melt, and a distinct Fig. 1). The sample site had a water depth of approxi- \nannual cycle of plankton biomass dominated in sum- mately 22 m. \nmer by high numbers of the colonial flagellate Phaeo- Preparation of FLB. FLB were prepared from natural \ncystis sp. (Davidson & Marchant 1992). Previous stud- bacterioplankton (Sherr & Sherr 1993). Three to four \nies in the locality have documented the taxonomic days prior to each experiment, 6 1 of water was col- \ncomposition and abundance of components of the lected from 5 m depth using an acid-cleaned 2.5 1 Go- \nplanktonic microbial community, including bacteria Flo water bottle. On return to the laboratory, the \nand HNAN (Marchant 1985, Perrin et al. 1987, Gibson natural bacterioplankton population (2 to 6 X 105 cells \net al. 1990, Marchant & Perrin 1990, Davidson & ml-l) was screened through a 10 pm mesh to remove \nMarchant 1992). The present study formed part of a large particulates, concentrated by centrifugation at \ncoordinated programme to measure microbial produc- 12 000 rpm (22 000 X g; Model 52-21 centrifuge with \ntivity and estimate the importance of heterotrophic JA14 rotor, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, \nprotists to carbon-energy flow in Antarctic coastal USA), resuspended in 10 m1 0 02 M tris buffer, and \nwaters. Associated studies were undertaken on the net incubated with 0.2 mg ml-l 5-(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl) \nmicrobial production (C. Robinson et al. unpubl.), cili- aminofluorescein (DTAF) for 1 h at 50 to 60\u00b0C. The FLB \nate herbivory (J. Grey & R. J. G. Leakey unpubl.) and were then washed 3 times with 0.02 M tris buffer, \nFig. 1 Study area showing the \nlocation of the samphng site (a) \nin the vicinity of the Australian \nAntarctic station of Davis \nL e a k e y  e t  al.. Microbial dynamics in Antarctic coastal waters  5 \nscreened through a 2.0 pm polycarbonate filter to \nremove clumps and stored frozen at -20\u00b0C. Final FLB \nconcentrations ranged from 3 to 6 X 107 cells ml-l, a \nconcentration factor of 80 to 252 times that of the nat- \nural bacterial population. \nExperimental procedure. For each experiment, \nmeasurements of water temperature and salinity were \nmade at 5 m depth using a Platypus CTD. Three repli- \ncate 2.5 1 Go-Flo water bottle samples were then col- \nlected from 5 m depth for the determination of chloro- \nphyll a (chl a) concentration, HNAN bacterivory and \nbacterial production, as outlined below. All polycar- \nbonate incubation bottles and tubes were cleaned by \nsoaking for 24 h in 10% HCl, rinsed several times with \ndeionised water, autoclaved and rinsed with experi- \nmental seawater immediately prior to use. Experimen- \ntal water was, at all times, maintained at  ambient \nwater temperature by storing in an insulated box filled \nwith water from 5 m depth, or by incubating in situ at \n5 m depth. All samples were stored cool and in the \ndark until processed. \nChl a concentration: Three replicate 1 1 samples \nwere returned to the laboratory and each filtered at  a \nvacuum pressure of 10 mm Hg onto a 47 mm diameter \nGFIF filter. Each filter was then stored frozen at  -20\u00b0C \nfor subsequent spectrophotometric analysis of chl a \nconcentration, according to Talling (1974). \nHNAN bacterivory: Approximately 30 min after \nsampling (to enable HNAN to recover from handling \nshock), 1 m1 of the FLB stock was added to each of \n3 replicate 450 m1 samples. Each sample was gently \nmixed and a 50 m1 t,,,, sub-sample removed immedi- \nately and fixed with 1 % final concentration ice-cold \nglutaraldehyde. The samples were then incubated in  \nsitu for after 10, 20, 40 and 80 min and 50 m1 sub- \nsamples were removed and fixed at each of these \ntimes. On return to the laboratory, l 0  m1 of each sub- \nsample were stained for 5 min with 5 p g  ml-' 4'6- \ndiamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), filtered onto a stan- \ndard 2 pm, 25 mm diameter polycarbonate filter (with \n0.2 pm cellulose nitrate backing filter), washed with \n0.2 pm filtered deionised water, mounted on a slide \nand stored frozen at -20\u00b0C prior to analysis. The sub- \nsamples were observed at 1250x magnification using a \nLeitz Labolux S eplfluorescence microscope equipped \nwith I2 (blue excitation) and A (UV excitation) filter \nblocks. Nanoflagellates were identified by their blue \nfluorescence observed under UV-light illumination, \nand heterotrophs distinguished from autotrophs by the \nabsence of chl a autofluorescence observed under \nblue-light illumination. HNAN were grouped into tax- \nonomic categories based on size, shape and morphol- \nogy. Choanoflagellates were identified by the pres- \nence of a collar of tentacles surrounding the flagellum \n(Buck et al. 1991). Dinoflagellates, distinguishable by \ntheir cell morphology and,  in particular, by their \nunique condensed chromosomes visible by DAPI stain- \ning (Verity et al. 19931, were not included in the analy- \nsis. \nThe abundance of each HNAN type was determined \nfrom 50 fields of view on each replicate filter from the \nt,,.,,, treatments. The hnear dimensions and volumes of \n30 cells of each taxon from 1 fllter were ineasured by \nimage analysis using a Sony CMCCD camera con- \nnected to a Seescan Solitaire Plus system. A high-pass \nfilter facility was used to enhance cell images and the \narea of each cell was then delineated manually. Cell \nvolume was calculated from cell area and perimeter \nmeasurements according to Fry & Davies (1985). \nHNAN population volume was calculated by multi- \nplying mean cell volume by abundance. Population vol- \nume was converted to carbon biomass using a conver- \nsion factor of 0.22 pg pn1r3 (Borsheim & Bratbak 1987). \nTo determine HNAN bacterivory up to 100 cells of \neach taxon were observed for each replicate filter from \nall treatments and the number of FLB ingested by each \ncell determined under blue-light illumination. Ingested \nFLB of different sizes could be  clearly distinguished \nwithin the same focal plane as the flagellates; however, \nHNAN within t,,,, treatments were also examined to \naccount for any FLB appearing to be  ingested but lying \non or below cells. HNAN cellular ingestion rate on \nbacterial-sized particles [(FLB + bacteria) HNAN-' h-'] \nwas then calculated by dividing mean FLB uptake \n(FLB HNAN-' h-') by FLB specific activity (i.e. FLB \nconcentration divlded by the total concentration of \nFLB + bacteria, determined as outlined below). Cellu- \nlar clearance rate (nl HNAN-' h- ' )  was determined \nby dividing the ingestion rate by the concentration of \nFLB + bacteria (McManus & Fuhrman 1988a). Volume \nspecific clearance rate was calculated from clearance \nrate divided by cell volume. The population clearance \nrate of each HNAN taxon (p1 1-' d-') was calculated \nfrom cellular clearance rate multiplied by HNAN \nabundance. Bacterial biomass removed by each HNAN \ntaxon (pg C 1-' d-') was  calculated from population \nclearance rate using bacterial biomass values deter- \nmined as outlined below. \nTo determine bacterial abundance, 5 m1 of each \nreplicate t,,,, sub-sample were stained with 5 1-19 ml-' \nDAPI, filtered onto a black 0.2 pm, 25 mm diameter \npolycarbonate filter, mounted on a slide and observed \nunder UV-light illumination. Bacteria were identified \nby their blue fluorescence and enumerated from 25 \nfields of view on each filter. To determine bacterial cell \nvolume, the volumes of 30 cells from 1 filter were \nmeasured by image analysis as outlined above but us- \ning a n  autolinteractive threshold function to delineate \ncell areas. FLB concentration and cell volume were \nsimilarly determined by concentrating a further 5 m1 \n6 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 142: 3-17, 1996 \nfrom each replicate t,,,, treatment onto a standard 0.2 \npm, 25 mm diameter polycarbonate filter and observ- \ning their yellow\/green fluorescence under blue-light \nillumination. Bacterial population volume was calcu- \nlated from abundance and cell volume estimates, and \nconverted to carbon biomass using a conversion factor \nof 0.22 pg m-3 (Bratbak & Dundas 1984). To compare \nbiomass estimates derived from cell volumes measured \nby image analysis or by calibrated ocular micrometer, \nbacterial biomass was also calculated by grouping \ncells into 4 size categories: 0.5 to 1 pm diameter cocci, \nand 0.5 to 1, l to 2 and 2 to 4 pm length rods. \nBacterial production: Bacterial production was deter- \nmined from [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fuhrman & \nAzam 1980, Bell 1993). A total of 450 p1 of an aqueous \nstock solution of [3H-methyl]thymidine (42 to 44 Ci \nmmol-') was added to each of 3 replicate 22.5 rnl samples \nto give an estimated 10 nM final concentration, and the \ncontents mixed. A t,,,, 10 m1 sub-sample was immedi- \nately removed and fixed with 1 % final concentration \nformaldehyde. The remaining 13 m1 were then incu- \nbated in situ at 5 m depth for 4 h after which a further \n10 m1 sub-sample was removed and fixed. A control \nsample, poisoned with formaldehyde prior to adding \n[3HJthymidine, was incubated concurrently. Each sub- \nsample was returned to the laboratory, filtered onto a \n0.2 pm, 25 mm diameter polycarbonate filter, rinsed with \n0.2 pm filtered autoclaved seawater, extracted with 2 X \n10 m1 ice-cold 5 % TCA for at  least 10 min, and finally \nrinsed with 80 % ethanol. Each filter was then placed in \na scintilIation vial and mixed with 10 m1 scintillation fluid \n(Opt~phase HiSafe 11, Wallac UK, Milton Keynes). After \n12 h, radioactivity in the sub-samples was measured us- \ning a Wallac LKB Rackbeta I1 (type 1215) liquid scintil- \nlation counter and the efficiency of counting determined \nby the external standard channels ratio method. \n[3H]thymidine incorporation was calculated from \ncounts (corrected for quenching and blanks) according \nto Bell (1993) using isotope specific activity values cor- \nrected for decay (Stewart & Hawcroft 1977). \nTo confirm linear incorporation of [3H]thymidine \nduring in situ incubation, a time course experiment \nwas undertaken on l l February 1994 using water from \nthe 3 replicate experimental water bottle samples \ncollected on that date. [3H]thymidine was added to \nreplicate 40 ml samples to produce a final concentra- \ntion of 10 nM. A 10 m1 sub-sample was immediately \nremoved and fixed, and the remaining sample incu- \nbated m situ for 2, 4 and 6 h after which further 10 m1 \nsub-samples were removed and fixed. All sub-samples \nwere then processed as above. Incorporation of \n[3H]thymidine was proportional to incubation time \nduring the 6 h incubation (regression: r2 = 0.904; p < \n0.001) confirming the appropriate choice of a 4 h incu- \nbation time for the bacterial production experiments. \nTo empirically determine a f3Hjthymidine conver- \nsion factor relating incorporation of isotope to bacterial \ngrowth, a calibration experiment was undertaken on \n13 February 1994 following the methodology of Kirch- \nman & Ducklow (1993). Water (2 1) was collected from \n5 m depth and 45 m1 diluted 1:9 with 0.22 pm filtered \nwater from the same source. Three replicate 20 m1 sub- \nsamples were removed and fixed with 1 % final con- \ncentration glutaraldehyde for subsequent enumeration \nof bacterial abundance and cell volume, as outlined \nabove. At the same time, a further three 20 m1 replicate \nsub-samples were removed for the in situ determina- \ntion of 13H]thymidine incorporation over 4 h, as out- \nlined above. The remaining 380 m1 sample was then \nincubated in situ for 24 h after which sub-samples \nwere removed for bacterial enumeration and [3H]- \nthymidine incorporation as before. No significant dif- \nference (t-test; p = 0.72) was observed between the \ncell volumes of bacteria recorded initially (mean = \n0.327 pm3) and after 24 h incubation (mean = 0.312 pm\". \nA 13H]thymidine conversion factor of 1.91 X 1018 cells \nmol-' was calculated from bacterial abundance and \nisotope incorporation rate using the integrative ap- \nproach (Kirchman & Ducklow 1993). This value was \nused to calculate bacterial population growth (cells 1-' \nd-l) from 13H]thymidine incorporation for each experi- \nment. Bacterial production was then calculated from \ngrowth using the mean cell carbon content estimated \nfor each experiment, as outlined above. \nTo check the 13H]thymidine concentration in experi- \nmental samples, a 100 p1 aliquot was removed from \neach t,,,, sub-sample before filtration, added to a scin- \ntillation vial, mixed with 1 m1 filtered deionised water \nfollowed by 10 m1 scintillation fluid, and counted. The \nconcentration of [3H]thymidine label, calculated from \nthese counts, ranged from 10.1 to 14.5 nM; slightly \nhigher than the estimated value of 10 nM. [3H]thymi- \ndine incorporation by bacteria has been found to \nbe almost constant for concentrations between 1 and \n20 nM in Southern Ocean waters (Bjarnsen & Kupari- \nnen 1991) and it is likely that uptake will have been \nsaturated in the present study. \nData analysis. Mean values presented for each \nexperiment were based on either 3 values correspond- \ning to 3 replicate 2.5 1 water bottle samples, or 30 \nvalues corresponding to 30 replicate cell volume mea- \nsurements. All 95 % confidence limits were calculated \nusing the pooled standard deviation. In order to calcu- \nlate the variance of HNAN and bacterial population \nvolume, v(P), the following formula was used: \nwhere: v(A) = variance of the abundance data on the \noriginal scales; v(C) = variance of the cell volume data \non the original scales; E(A) = mean abundance of 3 \nLeakey et al.: Microbial dynamics in Antarctic coastal waters 7 \nreplicates; and E(1) =mean  cell volume of 30 replicates. \nTo test for significant changes in the abundance and \ncell volume of bacteria, FLB and HNAN, l-way analy- \nses of variance and t-tests were conducted. To deter- \nmine the mean uptake rate of FLB HNAN-' h-', least \nsquares reg.ression was undertaken of the number of \nFLB cell-' versus time (Sherr & Sherr 1993). All analyses \nwere performed using the MINITAB 10.1 statistical \npackage (Minitab Inc.. State College. PA, USA). \nRESULTS \nMicrobial abundance, biomass and production \nDuring the study period, the salinity and tempera- \nture of the experimental samples varied from 32.6 to \n33.7%\" and from 1 . 4  to -0.4OC respectively (Table 1). \nMean chl a concentration increased from 6 and 5 p g  1-' \nduring late December and early January respectively \nto a maximum of 19 pg 1-' on 27 January, after which \nthe concentration fell to 3 pg 1-' on 11 February \n(Table 1). The sampling period was therefore charac- \nterised by a distinct summer peak of algal biomass. \nBacterial abundance, biomass and production in \nexperimental samples generally reflected chl a con- \ncentration with maximum values recorded in January. \nMean bacterial abundance increased from 2 X 108 1-' \nduring late December and early January to a maxi- \nmum of 8 X 108 1-' on 20 January (Table 1). Abundance \nthen declined to 4 X 108 1-' in February. Mean bac- \nterial cell volume, determined by image analysis, did \nnot vary significantly between experimental samples \n(ANOVA: p = 0.525) ranging from 0.28 to 0.40 pm3. \nChanges in bacterial biomass therefore reflected \nchanges in abundance and ranged from 13 pg C 1-' on \n30 December to 64 1-19 C 1-' on 20 January (Table 1). \nComparable biomass values calculated from cell vol- \n.umes determined using an ocular micrometer ranged \nfrom 9 pg C I- ' '  on 6 January to 40 pg C 1-' on 20 \nJanuary. Mean bacterial production, estimated from \n13H]thymidine incorporation, ranged from 8 pg C 1-' d-' \non 30 December to 14 pg C 1-' d-' on 14 and  20 Janu- \nary (Table 1).  \nThe HNAN con~munity in experimental samples \ncomprised several different taxa which were grouped \ninto the following 5 categories: small and large cho- \nanoflagellates, small and large non-collared HNAN, \nand colonial HNAN (Table 2).  The linear dimensions \nof these taxa did not differ markedly and the slze cate- \ngories were distinguished primarily on the basis of \nshape and morphology. Mean total HNAN abundance \nin the experimental samples ranged from 1.6 X 106 1-' \non 11 February to 4.2 X 106 1-l on 14 January (Table 1). \nAs with bacteria, HNAN biomass broadly reflected \nabundance with minimum and maximum values of \n8 pg C 1-' and 16 pg C I-' recorded on l l February and \n14 January, respectively (Table 1). Choanoflagellates \ndominated the HNAN community at  the beginning of \nthe study period, comprising 56 and 65 O\/o of the total \nHNAN abundance and biomass, respectively, on 30 \nDecember with maximum values of 1.5 X l ob  1-' and \n8 pg C I-' (Table 3, Fig. 2a, b).

Thus, \nafter 80 min a maximum of 91 % of large choanoflagel- \nlates had ingested FLB on 3 February, with a maximum \nof 13 FLB observed cell-' after 80 min on 27 January. In \nalmost all cases, plots of the mean number of FLB cell-' \nversus time revealed linear uptake of FLB between 10 \nand 80 min, with a slower rate of uptake observed \nduring the initial 10 min. Regression analyses were \ntherefore undertaken on data corresponding to the \nlinear portion of each uptake curve. Cellular \ningestion and clearance rates differed between \ntaxa ranging from a minimum of 0.06 particles \ncell-' h- '  and 0.06 nl cell-' h-', respectively, for \nsmall non-collared HNAN to a maximum of 8.28 \nparticles cell-' h-' and  9.32 nl cell-' h-' for large \nchoanoflagellates (Table 3) .  Cellular ingestion \nand clearance rates recorded for each taxon also \nvaried between expenments, and by approxi- \nmately 1 order of magnitude for small choano- \nflagellates. However, no relationship was ob- \nserved for any of the taxa between either \ningestion rate and total particle concentration \n(regression: r 2  I 0.257, p t 0.140), or clearance \nrate and total particle concentration (regression: \nr2  I 0.013, p t 0.346). Volume specific clearance \nrates varied between different taxa and \nbetween experiments from 0.7 X 104 h-' for \nlarge non-collared HNAN to 4 X 10' h-' for small \nchoanoflagellates (Table 3) .  \nDuring the study period the total HNAN \npopulation cleared between 3 and 12% of \nthe water column, and thus equivalent percent- \nages of bacterial abundance and biomass, daily \n(Table 4). The amount of bacterial carbon \ngrazed ranged from 0.9 pg C 1-' d- '  on 11 Feb- \nruary to 4.7 pg C 1-' d-' on 27 January, equiva- \nlent to 10 and 36 % of daily bacterial production \nrespectively (Table 4, Fig. 2c). Choanoflagel- \nlates were responsible for much of the grazing \nimpact at the beginning of the study period \nremoving up  to 7 %  of bacterial biomass and \n17% of bacterial production per day and com- \nprising up to 68% of the total HNAN grazing \neffort on 20 January (Table 3,  Fig. 2c). Towards \nthe end of the study large non-collared HNAN \nwere the dominant grazers removing up to 11 \nand 31 '% (3 February) of bacterial biomass and \nproduction per day, respectively, equivalent to \n91 % of the total HNAN grazing effort. Colonial \nHNAN and  small non-collared HNAN con- \ntributed <32 and <4 % of the total community \ngrazing effort, respectively, throughout the \nstudy (Table 3, Fig. 2c). \n10 Mar Ecol Prog Ser 142: 3-17, 1996 \nTable 4.

The abundance and bio- \nmass values reported in this study, undertaken in a \ncoastal locality during summer months, a re  therefore \nexpected to be relatively high when compared to \nvalues recorded during winter months or from many \noceanic Antarctic environments. \nChl a concentrations recorded in experimental \nsamples increased during the study period to a mid \nsummer peak of 19 1-19 I-', then declined rapidly. This \npattern of mid summer chl a maxima is characteristic \nof the study site (Perrin et  al. 1987) and other Antarctic \ncoastal pelagic environments at  King George Island \n(Lipski 1987), Signy Island (Clarke et al. 1988, Clarke \n& Leakey 1996) and  McMurdo Sound (Rivkin 1991). \nConcurrent observations at the sample site revealed \nthe algal community to be dominated by a small \ncentric diatom Actinocyclus sp., Phaeocystis sp. and \ncryptornonads with between 4 and 74 % of chl a within \nthe nanophytoplankton (2 to 20 pm) size fraction (J .  \nGrey & R. J .  G. Leakey unpubl.). \noffshore from Signy Island, King George Island and \nAdelie Land (Table 5). In contrast to bacterial abun- \ndance, the biomass values of 13 to 64 pg C I-' reported \nin this study are amongst the highest recorded for \nAntarctic coastal waters (Table 5); however, this can be \nattributed to the use of different methods to size bac- \nterial cells. In the present study, cell sizes were mea- \nsured by both image analysis and ocular micrometer. \nThe former method is likely to be more accurate as it \naccounts for variations in cell shape,  calculating cell \nvolume from cell area and perimeter rather than single \nlength and breadth measurements. In all experiments, \naverage cell volume estimated by image analysis was \ngreater than when estimated by ocular micrometer \nresulting in higher biomass values: 13 to 64 versus 9 to \n40 pg C I-', respectively. The latter values are gener- \nally similar to values reported from Antarctic coastal \nstudies where bacterial cell volume has been esti- \nmated by ocular micrometer (Table 5). The use of \ndifferent factors to convert bacterial cell volume to \ncarbon biomass also contributes towards differences \nbetween biomass estimates. Other coastal Antarctic \nstudies have used carbon conversion factors of be- \ntween 0.121 and 0.4 pg C pm-3 (Table 5) .  The value of \n0.22 pg C pm-3 (Bratbak & Dundas 1984) used in the \npresent study lies within this range and has been used \nin previous studies undertaken offshore from Signy \nIsland and King George Island (Table 5).

Mean \nbacterial production in the present study varied from \n8 to 14 pg C 1-' d-' and was therefore within the upper \nrange of values reported from Antarctic waters. The \ncalculation of bacterial production from 13H]thymidine \nincorporation requires the use of 2 conversion factors: \none to convert thymidine incorporation to bacterial \ngrowth (the thymidine conversion factor) and another \nto convert bacterial growth to carbon biomass (the car- \nbon conversion factor) (Bell 1993). Thymidine conver- \nsion factors used in other Antarctic studies range from \n0.2 to 20 X 1018 cells mol-' (e.g. Fuhrman & Azam 1980, \nRivkin 1991; reviewed by Ducklow & Carlson 1992). The \nexperimentally determined value of 1.91 X 1018 cells \nmol-' used in the present study therefore lies within \nthis range and is similar to mean experimentally deter- \nmined values of 1.1 X 1018 and 2.2 X 1018 cells mol-' \nreported from Antarctic waters by Bjornsen & Kupari- \nnen (1991) and Rivkin et al. (1989), respectively. The \nuse of carbon conversion factors has been discussed \nabove, and it follows that the high bacterial biomass \nvalues recorded in the present study will in turn have \ncontributed to the relatively high estimates of bacterial \nproduction. \nThe few studies to have accurately quantified \nheterotrophic flagellates in Antarctic waters have \ngenerally been undertaken in oceanic environments \nrevealing abundances as high as 10\"o 10\"-l and bio- \nmass values up  to 60 pg C 1-' (reviewed by Garrison & \nGowing 1993). The total HNAN abundance and bio- \nmass values recorded in the present study are rela- \ntively high, with maxima of 4 .2  x 106 1- I  and 16.2 1-19 C \n1-l; this probably reflects the productive nature of \nAntarctic coastal waters during the austral summer. In \ncontrast to previous Antarctic studies, the biomass val- \nues reported in the present study were derived using \nImage analysis and a carbon conversion factor of 0.22 \npg m-3. The use of different methods of calculating \nHNAN biomass will, therefore, again have contributed \nto the differences between estimates from different \nAntarctic studies. Several studies have reported \nshrinkage of HNAN upon fixation with glutaraldehyde \n(Berrsheim & Bratbak 1987, Bloem et al. 1988, Choi & \nStoecker 1989, Hondeveld et  al. 1992) and it is likely \nthat the fixation protocol used in the present study will \nhave altered HNAN cell volume. However, use of the \nabove carbon conversion factor, calculated for a bac- \nterivorous Monas sp. fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and \nstained with DAPI (Borsheim & Bratbak 1987), will \nhave helped compensate for such cell volume changes. \nThe HNAN community in experimental samples \ncomprised a variety of taxa including choanoflagel- \nlates and non-collared forms. Choanoflagellates are  \ncommon in Antarctic waters and  the abundance and \ncommunity composition of choanoflagellates in waters \noffshore from Davis station has been previously stud- \nied in detail (Marchant 1985, Marchant & Perrin 1990, \nDavidson & Marchant 1992). Three species, Bicosta \nspinifera, Crinolina aperta and  Parvicorbicula socialis, \ndominate the comn~unity during the austral summer \nwith maximum abundances recorded in January and \nFebruary (Marchant & Perrin 1990). It was not possible \nto identify choanoflagellates precisely from the slide \npreparations used in this study; however, the small \nchoanoflagellates closely resembled Bicosta sp.  in size \nand shape. Choanoflagellates achieved a maximum \nabundance in experimental samples of 1.5 X 106 I-', \ncomparable to a peak of 1.2 X 106 1-I previously ob- \nserved offshore from Davis station in early January \n(Davidson & Marchant 1992). It is clear from the pre- \nsent study that choanoflagellates dominate the total \nHNAN community in late December and early January \nwhile other unidentified non-collared HNAN were \nquantitatively more important later In the summer. \nThe abundance of colonial HNAN tended to decline \nduring the study period in a similar manner to that \nof choanoflagellates. It was not possible to identify the \ncolonial HNAN; however, it is likely that the colonial \nchoanoflagellate Parvicorbicula socialis was included \nin this group. \nGrazing methodology \nSeveral methods have been used to measure protis- \ntan bacterivory in planktonic environments (reviewed \nby McManus & Fuhrman 1988b, also see Berninger et \nal. 1991a and Landry 1994). The use of fluorescently \nlabelled particles a s  tracers of bacterial ingestion offers \nseveral advantages over other methods including the \nuse of short incubation times, minimal manipulation of \nsamples, and  the derivation of taxon specific grazing \nrates (Sherr & Sherr 1993). However, the technique has \npotential limitations which should be considered when \nassessing estimates of HNAN bacterivory. These in- \nclude: rapid or random digestion of FLB by HNAN \nduring linear uptake of FLB; selective grazing by \nHNAN on labelled or non-labelled particles; alteration \nof HNAN grazing rate by increasing the concentration \nof food particles; and egestion of HNAN food vacuoles \n12 Mar Ecol Prog Ser \nupon preservation (Sherr et al. 1989, McManus & \nOkubo 1991). In addition, and in common with all \nmethods of measuring protistan grazing by incubat- \ning natural samples, containment effects may influ- \nence grazing rates (Venrick et al. 1977, Peters & \nGross 1994). \nIn grazing experiments using FLB as tracers of inges- \ntion, incubation times are  kept to a minimum in order \nto ensure that the uptake of FLB versus time is linear \nduring the course of each experiment. Linear increase \nin FLB uptake with time discontinues when the first \nFLB ingested have been completely digested or \negested; experimental incubation times should there- \nfore be less than the time taken to digest or egest FLB \n(Sherr & Sherr 1993). Rapid or random digestion of FLB \nby HNAN would clearly lead to an  underestimation of \ningestion rate; however, it has been shown that an  \ninitial processing period exists during which digestion \nproceeds to a point when FLB are  no longer identifi- \nable (Sherr et al. 1988). This processing period has \nbeen found to increase with decreasing temperature \nfrom 34 min at  20\u00b0C to 80 min at  12OC for a mixed \nassemblage of marine HNAN (Sherr et  al. 1988), sug- \ngesting that an  incubation period of 80 min is appro- \npriate for experiments undertaken in cold Antarctic \nwaters. This was confirmed by the linear uptake rates \nrecorded between 10 and 80 min in the present study. \nUptake was slower durlng the initial 10 min of each \nexperiment, perhaps due  to the effects of gently mix- \ning experimental samples to disperse FLB at the begin- \nning of each incubation. \nIn the present study, FLB were prepared using nat- \nural bacteria collected from the experimental site 3 to \n4 d prior to each experiment. This approach requires \nmore effort than the alternative of staining cultured \nbacteria, but simulates more accurately the character- \nistics of the natural bacterial population. The cell vol- \numes of FLB were similar to those of natural bacteria, \nsuggesting that staining did not alter overall cell size. \nHowever, there is some evidence that flagellates \nmay select motile living bacterial cells in preference to \nheat-killed FLB with subsequent grazing rates under- \nestimated by 50% or more (Landry et  al. 1991, Monger \n& Landry 1992, Gonzalez et al. 1993, Fuhrman & Nobel \n1995). \nIdeally FLB should be added to experimental sam- \nples in sufficient concentration to allow measurable \nuptake during short incubations, but without greatly \nincreasing the concentration of food particles avail- \nable to the bacterivores. An optimal concentration of \nabout 30'%, of total bacterioplankton has therefore \nbeen recommen.ded (Sherr & Sherr 1993). In the pre- \nsent study, logistical constraints precluded the  accu- \nrate quantification of bacterioplankton concentration \nin experimental samples prior to adding FLB. Conse- \nquently, final FLB concentrations varied between \nexperiments and were equ~valent to between 29 and \n98% of the total bacterioplankton concentration, cor- \nresponding to between 22 and 49\"<1 of the total food \nparticle concentration (FLB + bacteria). When HNAN \ningestion is not saturated cellular ingestion rates \nincrease with increasing food concentration. In such \ncircumstances addition of surrogate food particles \nmay provide ingestion rates that are greater than \ningestion rates for natural particles alone (McManus \n& Okubo 1991). Half-saturation constant values of \nbetween 1.3 and 38 X 10\"acteria l'' have been \nrecorded for a range of laboratory cultured HNAN \ngrown at 20\u00b0C (Fenchel 1982) and these values are \ngreater than the maximum food particle concentration \nof 1.1 X 109 1-' recorded in the present study. This sug- \ngests that HNAN ingestion may not have been satu- \nrated in the experimental samples; although it should \nbe noted that ingestion rates, and thus half-saturation \nconstants, are likely to be lower at lower temperatures \n(Caron et al. 1986, Sherr et  al. 1988, Tobiesen 1990, \nChoi & Peters 1992). Cellular ingestion rates varied \nconsiderably between experiments; however, no sig- \nnificant relationship was detected between ingestion \nrate and total particle concentration. This prevented \na n  assessment of the degree to which the recorded \nparticle ingestion rates may have overestimated nat- \nural bacterial ingestion rates (McManus & Okubo \n1991). In contrast to ingestion rate, HNAN cellular \nclearance rate may decrease with increasing food \nparticle concentration (Fenchel 1982). The addition of \ndifferent concentrations of FLB may therefore have \nled to differential underestimation of cellular clear- \nance rates in the present study, which will in turn \nhave led to the underestimation of population grazing \nimpact. Although clearance rates varied between \nexperiments, no relationship was detected between \nclearance and total particle concentration, again pre- \nventing a n  assessment of the degree to which rates \nmay have been underestimated. \nEgestion of HNAN food vacuoles upon fixation with \nglutaraldehyde has been reported (Sieracki et al. 1987, \nhlcManus & Fuhrman 1988a) and may lead to an  \nunderestimation of FLB ingestion. However, ice-cold \nglutaraldehyde has been successfully used in HNAN \ngrazing experiments using FLB as tracers of ingestion \n(Bloem et al. 1989, Sherr et  al. 1989) and there was no \nevidence of food vacuole egestion in the present study. \nIn this context, it is significant that the choanoflagellate \nclearance rates reported in the present study, which \nvaried from 0.2 to 8.28 nl cell-' h-', were in most cases \nhigher than the maximum clearance rates of 0.7 nl \ncell-' h-'  measured at  0\u00b0C on live individuals of the \nchoanoflagellate Diaphanoeca grandis isolated from \nsea ice (Marchant 1990). \nLeakey et al.: Microbial dynamics in Antarctic coastal waters 1: \nHNAN bacterivory \nThe HNAN clearance and ingestion rates recorded \nin the present study ranged from 0.06 to 9.32 111 cell-' \nh:' and 0.06 to 8.28 particles cell-' h-' respectively. \nThere is little information available on the grazing \nrates of HNAN in Antarctic waters but a maximum \nclearance rate of 3 nl cell-' h- '  has been recorded for \nthe choanoflagellate Acanthocorbis unguiculata in \nwaters offshore from Davis station (Marchant & Scott \n1993). An ingestion rate of 30 bacteria cell\" h-' has \nalso been recorded at  1 .8OC for cultures of the bac- \nterivorous HNAN Paraphysomonas imperforata iso- \nlated from Arctic waters (Choi & Peters 1992). The \nmaximum cellular clearance and ingestion rates re- \ncorded in the present study fall within the range of \nvalues commonly observed in warmer water environ- \nments, although maximum rates from temperate and \ntropical waters are generally higher (Berninger et al. \n1991a, Carlough & Meyer 1991, Vaque et al. 1994). \nThis is to be expected as HNAN ingestion rate is posi- \ntively related to temperature both in culture (Caron \net al. 1986, Sherr et  al. 1988, Tobiesen 1990, Choi & \nPeters 1992) and in field populations (Peters 1994. \nVaque et  al. 1994). and choanoflagellate grazing rates \nare  considered to be lower in cold waters (Marchant & \nScott 1993). \nDuring the study period, HNAN removed an esti- \nmated 0.9 to 4.7 pg of bacterial carbon 1-' d-l, equiva- \nlent to between 3 and 12% of bacterial biomass and \n10 and 36% of bacterial production. HNAN carbon- \nbased gross growth efficiency can vary with tempera- \nture and prey condition, with higher values recorded \nat  lower temperatures (Caron et al. 1986, Choi & Peters \n1992, Gonzalez et  al. 1993). Assuming a gross growth \nefficiency of approximately 30% (Caron & Goldman \n1990), the biomass of bacteria consumed by the total \nHNAN community in the present study would support \ndoubling times of 8 to 40 d. These are  likely to be min- \nimum estimates due  to consumption by HNAN of other \nsources of food such as high molecular weight dis- \nsolved organic matter (Sherr 1988, Marchant & Scott \n1993), viruses (Gonzalez & Suttle 1993), cyanobacteria \n(Caron et al. 1991, Kuosa 1991) and other protists \n(Sanders 1991). \nThere are currently no other studies from Antarctic \nwaters which have attempted comprehensively to esti- \nmate total HNAN community bacterivory concurrently \nwith estimates of bacterial biomass and production. It \nis therefore not possible to compare HNAN community \ngrazing impact with values from other Antarctic locali- \nties. Marchant & Scott (1993) have, however, esti- \nmated that choanoflagellates would clear 7 ?h of sur- \nface waters per day offshore from Davis station during \nsummer. In thls study, choanoflagellates also cleared \nup  to 7 % of daily bacterial biomass. When compared to \nsome non-polar marine environments, where flagellate \ngrazing may account for the entire daily bacterial pro- \nduction (Berninger et  al. 1991a, Capriulo et  al. 1991), \nthe gra.zing impact of HNAN reported in this study is \nrelatively low. \nIn a stable community where bacterial abundance is \nnot changing, bacterial loss processes should balance \nproduction. Where HNAN bacterivory is the primary \nsource of bacterial mortality, consumption of bacteria \nby HNAN should approximately balance daily bac- \nterial production. During the present study bacterial \nabundance remained relatively stable yet the HNAN \ncommunity removed less than half of the bacterio- \nplankton production. The discrepancy between the \nmagnitude of bacterial production and HNAN bac- \nterivory could be due to either uncoupling of produc- \ntion and grazing during the study period, methodolog- \nical problems, or other sources of bacterial mortality. \nUncoupling of bacterial production and HNAN graz- \ning is to be  expected in some experimental samples \ndue  to predator prey oscillations which may occur di- \nurnally, or over a period of days to weeks (Sherr et  al. \n1989, Sanders et  al. 1992). The consistently low graz- \ning impact of HNAN on bacterial production observed \nin the present study over a 7 wk period suggests that \nuncoupling over a time period of days to weeks is \nunlikely to be responsible for the low grazing impact of \nHNAN. All 7 experiments were undertaken during the \nearly afternoon and would have been equally suscepti- \nble to differential diurnal cycles of grazing and pro- \nduction. Diurnal cycles of bacterial production and fla- \ngellate bacterivory have been observed in temperate \nand tropical waters (Fuhrman et al. 1985, Weisse 1989, \nWikner et  al. 1990), with both processes closely cou- \npled in some cases (Weisse 1989, Wikner et al. 1990). \nHowever, such diurnal variation is less likely during \nthe periods of almost continuous daylight experienced \nat  high latitude sites during mid summer. \nMethodological problems associated with the esti- \nmation of bacterial production and HNAN bacterivory \nhave been discussed above. In addition, HNAN may \npreferentially select larger, actively growing bacteria \nwithin natural bacterial assemblages, thus cropping \nbacterial prod'uction more effectively (Andersson et \nal. 1986, Gonzalez et al. 1990, Sherr et  al. 1992). Such \nselectivity would lead to an  underestimate of the graz- \ning impact of the HNAN population on both bacterial \nbiomass and production. HNAN may also selectively \ngraze on bacteria associated with aggregates (Caron \n1987, Sibbald & Albright 1988); such ingestion would \nnot be detected using FLB leading to a n  underestima- \ntion of grazing impact. By contrast, attachment to sus- \npended particles may also give bacteria a refuge from \ngrazing so that the amount of production available to \n14 Mar Ecol Prog Ser  142: 3-17, 1996 \ngrazers will have been overestimated (Jiirgens & Giide \n1994). The magnitude of bacterial production associ- \nated with particles was not assessed in the present \nstudy, but may have been significant (Pedros-Alio & \nBrock 1983). \nOn balance it would seem likely that HNAN bac- \nterivory will have been underestimated in the present \nstudy, particularly due to the methodological problems \nassociated with possible preferential selection of llve \nbacteria. For HNAN bacterivory to balance bacterial \nproduction, grazing rates would have to be underesti- \nmated by a factor of between 2.8 and 10. Given that \npreferential selection of live bacteria could underesti- \nmate grazing rates by more than 50%, i t  would seem \nlikely that HNAN bacterivory may, on occasion, have \nbalanced bacterial production. However, alternative \nsources of bacterial mortality, which include sponta- \nneous death and lysis of bacteria, lysis due to infection \nby lytic bacteria, lysis due to bacteriophage, starvation. \nsedimentation and grazing by other organisms, are \nlikely to have been of significance during most experi- \nments (McManus & Fuhrman 1988b, Pace 1988, Sherr \net al. 1989). \nLittle information is available on the possibility of \nspontaneous lysis or on infection by lytic bacteria, \nalthough the latter have been isolated from natural \nwaters (Shilo 1984. McManus & Fuhrman 1988b). \nWhile starvation is likely to influence the seasonal \nabundance of bacterioplankton, it is probably a minor \ncomponent of daily bacterial mortality (Pace 1988). \nThe magnitude of bacterial loss from Antarctic coastal \nwaters due to sedimentation is also not known but \ncould be significant if a substantial component of the \nbacterial population is associated with particles or \nflocs. Recently it has been demonstrated that bacterio- \nphages can be numerous in marine waters (Bergh et al. \n1989), including the So.uthern Ocean (Smith et al. \n1992), and up to 36% of bacterioplankton mortality has \nbeen attributed to viral lysis in Arctic waters (Steward \net al. 1996). Viral-induced lysis may therefore have \nbeen a significant cause of bacterial mortality in the \npresent study. \nGrazing by other protists and metazodns may dlso be \nresponsible for significant bacterial mortality. Many \nmetazoan zooplankton consume marine bacteria but \nthey are generally inefficient at capturing small plank- \ntonic bacteria and grazing impacts on bacterioplank- \nton popula.tions appear to be low (King et al. 1980, \nJ ~ r g e n s e n  1984, Turner et al. 1988). The magnitude of \nbacterial mortality due to metazoan grazers is likely to \nbe greater in coastal waters where much production \nmay be attributable to particle-attached bacteria and \nthus grazed more efficiently (Lawrence et al. 1993). \nBenthic suspension feeders can be active during much \nof the year in Antarctic coastal waters (Barnes & \nClarke 1995) but their impact upon bacterial popula- \ntions is not known. Other protists, and in particular \nhetc:rotrophic dinoflagellates (Lessard 1991, Neuer & \nCowles 1995), small ciliates (Sherr & Sherr 1994) and \npigmented flagellates (Porter 1988, Sanders 1991) may \nbe important bacterivores In pelagic waters. The graz- \ning impact of these groups on Antarctic bacterioplank- \nton is not known; however, planktonic ciliates and \nheterotrophic dinoflagellates were common in surface \nwaters during the study period (Archer et al. in press, \nGrey & Leakey unpubl.) and may have been responsi- \nble for significant bacterial mortality. Pigmented \nnanoflagellates did not appear from incidental obser- \nvations to have ingested FLB in present study. \nThere has recently been much debate on the \ndegree to which bacterioplankton populations are \ncontrolled and lim~ted by bottom-u.p (i.e. resources) or \ntop-down (i.e. predation) factors in both marine and \nfreshwater environments (Billen et al. 1990, Berninger \net al. 1991b, Ducklocv 1992, Sanders et al. 1992, Gas01 \n& Vaques 1993, Pace & Cole 1994). It is likely that \nboth processes operate to varying degrees according \nto the heterogeneity of the community (Hunter & \nPrice 1992); however, there is some evidence that bot- \ntom-up control may be more important in regulating \nbacterial abundances in oligotrophic environments, \nwhile top-down control may be more important in \neutrophic environments (Sanders et al. 1992). It is not \nclear to what extent either mechanism llmited bacter- \nial growth in the present study, but HNAN bac- \nterivory appears insufficient on its own to exert top- \ndown control. HNAN may themselves be subject \nto predation by ciliates (Verity 1991), dinoflagellates \n(Kuparinen & Bj~rnsen 1992) and metazoan zooplank- \nton (Stoecker & Capuzzo 1990), and such predation \nmay have indirectly reduced the extent of HNAN bac- \nterivory in the present study. The effects of such \n'trophic cascades' (Sanders et al. 1992) are complex, \ninfluencing the regeneration of nutrients available to \nbacteria as well as grazing mortality. HNAN bac- \nterivory is therefore likely to be one of several factors \ninfluencing the magnitude of bacterial production in \nihe cold dnd h~ghly sedsonai bvdters oflshore from \nDavis station. \nAr-knowledgements.
