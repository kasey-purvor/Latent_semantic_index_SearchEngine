Introduction \nBuilding energy use is quite an important issue as energy is one of the most critical resources \nused over the lifetime of a building. UK energy policy is leading the construction industry \ntowards dramatic reductions in energy use in buildings with the zero carbon targets by year \n2016 for domestic and by 2019 for non domestic buildings. Buildings require direct energy \nthroughout their life cycle during construction, operation, and end of life treatment and \nindirect energy with the production of materials. Besides this, materials used in buildings are \nalso responsible for other environmental impacts such as resource consumption, waste \ngeneration and other air emissions.  \nThe building environmental concerns have motivated industry professionals to pursue low \nimpact building designs and strategies. Globally the construction industry has an immense \ncontribution to socio-economic development but is also responsible for the consumption of \nenergy and natural resources. Ideally, a multi disciplinary approach covering issues like \nemissions reductions, improved use of materials, reuse and recycling is needed to achieve the \ngoals of building sustainability [1].  \nLife cycle assessment (LCA) is a key approach to analyse the whole life impact of a building \nas it allows for the estimation of impacts distribution across all the life cycle stages by \nintegrating upstream and downstream material and energy flows. There has been an \nincreasing interest in the energy use of buildings in a lifetime perspective in the last few years \n[2] and descriptive work on residential and non domestic buildings (primarily offices), but \nlimited research has been published thus far on the lifecycle emissions assessment of a \ndistribution warehouse. Much of the work on the life cycle environmental impact of \nconstruction has focused on estimating greenhouse gas emissions because of the relative ease \nof quantification, and the establishment of international protocols (particularly Kyoto) [3]. \nScheuer et al., [4] assert the importance of LCA of whole buildings to identify and evaluate \nhow key design parameters will influence a building\u2019s environmental performance. Life cycle \nthinking is a conceptual aid to the decision making process for the balancing of the effects of \nmanufacturing, use and disposal of the products within construction [5].  Operational energy \nof buildings is the energy required to condition (heat, cool and ventilate), light the interior \nspaces and to power equipment and other services, however it varies considerably with \nbuilding use patterns, climate and season, and the efficiency of the building and its systems \n[6]. \nIn a Canadian office building study, Cole and Kernan [6] conclude that operational energy is \nthe largest component of the life-cycle energy consumption. The study states that for a \nbuilding designed following conventional energy performance standards, the embodied \nenergy will represent an increasing component of the life cycle energy consumption with the \nincreasing building operational efficiency [6]. Sartori and Hestness\u2019 [7] analysis of 60 \nbuilding case studies also revealed that operating energy represents by far the largest part of \nenergy demand in a building during its life cycle. They illustrated a linear relation between \noperating and total life time energy which is valid through all the case studies despite climate \nand other contextual differences thus demonstrating the life time efficiency of low energy \nbuildings compared to conventional ones even with a higher embodied impact [7]. Fay et al., \n[8] emphasized the importance of analysis of embodied energy in assessing and managing the \nenvironmental impacts of construction projects. Trusty and Meil [9] highlighted the \nimportance of the initial structure and envelope embodied energy with improving operating \nenergy efficiency in an analysis of a two versions of an office building design in Canada and \nconcluded that a modest increase in material use of a building design contributes to a 2.5 fold \nincrease in heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) efficiencies improvement in its \nannual operating energy use. The relative importance of the production phase may also be \nexpected to increase in the future since the energy use in the use phase can be reduced \nsubstantially by means of well proven technologies [10]. In a study comparing the two \ndistribution warehouses in the UK, Fieldson and Siantonas [11] suggests that over the life \ncycle of the building, embodied and operational emissions will be about equal, which is \nmainly a reflection on the efficient operational performance with services and fabric \nimprovements in combination with a short design life. \nIn a University building study on optimal selection of different wall cladding systems and \nmaterials (stucco, masonry, aluminium, vinyl and exterior insulation and finish systems) \nRadhi [12] found that vinyl has the best performance in reducing embodied CO2 emissions, \nbut provides a moderate reduction in terms of operational energy, however exterior insulation \nand finish systems positively impact the embodied energy and can optimise the operational \nenergy performance. Hence, a careful evaluation should be carried out in selecting wall \nsystems and cladding materials in order to effectively reduce the life cycle CO2 emissions \n[12]. The initial design phase presents an opportunity to considerably reduce the building \nlifecycle energy and associated emissions. At early stages of design, architects can make \ncritical decisions to formulate the most effective design strategies and solutions through \nprinciples of bioclimatic design and to establish the future lines in selecting low carbon \nmaterials as the total performance of a building is the result of the collective effects of all \ndesign parameters. [13] \n LCA and carbon footprinting approaches can not only quantify the building environmental \nburden but can also show reduction measures [14], however some of their aspects can present \nsignificant challenges to support building decision making from a life cycle perspective. In \norder for such an approach to fulfill its potential in assisting design decisions, there is a need \nfor detailed data on specific building systems and components that will enable the design \nteam to construct and customize LCA for an evaluation of performance and material tradeoffs \nacross life cycles [4]. \nBuilding CO2 emissions optimization adds to this complexity mainly due to the various \nparameters and variables that interfere in a building life cycle. Reijnders [15] highlights that \ndue to the scale and life span of building, generally the material and operation impacts could \nonly be addressed as other aspects like indoor climate, siting  etc. are beyond the scope of a \ntypical LCA study. Essentially achieving an energy-optimised design requires the ability to \ninvestigate both operational and embodied energy implications of alternative design options \n[16]. Typically the relationship between initial impact and operational emissions varies  for \ndifferent building types depending on the extent to which the operational rating has been \nreduced by the effectiveness of the design and the anticipated design life of the building [17]. \nThe introduction of the Energy Performance in Buildings Directive has had a major impact of \nthe way energy performance is measured and has rightly become part of client requirements \nin the UK [17]. This increasing carbon focussed approach has also been supported with UK \nGovernment\u2019s zero carbon targets for commercial and domestic buildings, which has resulted \nin interests across the industry in minimising the operational carbon emissions from buildings. \nWith this approach, it is likely that environmental burden across the building life cycle is \ngoing to shift for many building types. \nThere are a variety of approaches for designing low-energy building; however, a peculiarity is \nthat a reduced demand for operating energy is achieved by an increased use of materials, both \nin the building envelope and in the technical installations [7]. The benefit of reducing \noperational energy, to a large extent can be counterbalanced by similar increases in the \nembodied energy. Embodied energy data and life cycle analysis should be included in global \nenergy certification schemes in order to effectively lead the building sector toward \nsustainability [18]. \n2. Research objectives \n1. To identify the influence of design and construction materials on operating CO2 emissions. \n2. To identify the relative importance of operational and the embodied impacts during the life \nspan of the building. \n3. To identify the effect of materials substitution on operating and embodied CO2 emissions. \n3. Scope and methodology.  \nThis study arises from the need to compare embodied and operational solutions for reducing \nlife cycle emissions in a distribution warehouse and aims to analyse how different designs and \nbuilding materials affect the results of the carbon assessment over the building design life. \nThe research was carried out to assess the burden of embodied materials and heating impact \nover the design life of 25 years for different scenarios of rooflight ratio (RLR) and improved \ninsulation in a life cycle perspective. For the latter, Ecotect building design and environmental \nanalysis tool [19] was used that covers the full range of simulation and analysis functions to \nsimulate the operation and performance of a building design. Carbon emission inventory data \nwas developed from a variety of sources including Bath University Inventory of Carbon and \nEnergy (ICE) [20], commercially available Simapro software [21] for wall and roof cladding \nsystems and manufacturer\u2019s data for alternative materials (Hemcrete). Bath ICE is a publicly \navailable embodied energy and carbon dataset representing typical building materials \nemployed in the British market and hence used to assess most of the installed materials in this \nstudy. Simapro is a professional LCA tool to collect, analyze and monitor the environmental \nperformance of products and services. It is important to note that the issues relating to \nconstruction or embodied energy of building materials varies in different countries, depending \namong other things considerably on the energy mix used for manufacturing materials [22]. \n3.1 Building Description \nThe case study building is a conventional distribution centre, one storey building with two \nstorey open plan offices and workshops. The building has a footprint of 7807 m2 with a total \nfloor plan of 8060 m2. Fig. 1 shows floor plans and the 3D image of the building. Table 1 lists \nassumptions made to represent the base case scenario. Table 2 illustrates the material \ninventory for the estimation of the embodied impact of the main materials specified for the \nbase case building. It is assumed that the distribution centre is located in Sheffield, UK, which \nhas a generally mild and temperate climate representing the climate of eastern England.  \n3.2 Assumptions \nThe paper strictly focuses on embodied and heating impacts excluding construction, waste \ngenerated, transport, maintenance, refurbishment, and end of life emissions. Refurbishment \nimpact is not so significant in this particular building type owing to its low maintenance and \nshort design life. In reality the service lives of different building materials and components, \nand their effect on the building and its service life need to be analysed thoroughly [23]. As for \nmost building types, replacement and repairs of building components throughout the service \nlife could raise the annually repeating impact shifting the environmental impact distribution \nbalance [24]. Materials like internal finishes, carpets, plasterboard, sealants etc. were \nexcluded, as they were not found to be significant. In addition Mechanical & Electrical \n(M&E) services installations were also excluded due to the uncertainty in estimating the \nimpacts from plastics and metal components. Controls, schedules, air-infiltration rates, system \nperformance characteristics and occupant patterns of distribution centres vary depending on \nthe products stored within. Assumptions made for this study closely represent those typical of \na non-food product centre. It is important to note that the design life of a building is \ndependent on the durability of its materials and construction.  In this study, the materials and \ndesigns selected were limited to those which could be assumed to have a design life of 25 \nyears, without significant energy expenditures for recurrent embodied energy i.e. maintenance \nor renovation as this is representative of the light industrial\/commercial distribution \nconstruction sector.  \nEcotect computer simulation program was used to determine the heating demand of the \nbuilding. The program was also used to estimate the availability of daylight under different \nroof configuration.  The building is naturally ventilated and the operating equipment in the \nwarehouse area is considered to be negligible limited to a few lift trucks operating in this area. \nBy increasing the rooflight ratio (RLR) in the warehouse and workshop, one may assume that \nthe need for artificial lighting during the daytime hours may be reduced in these areas through \ngood housekeeping and control systems resulting in the heating loads to be the dominant \ncomponent of the operational impact.   \n4. Material Burdens \nIn order to determine the embodied impact of the total structure, the quantity of construction \nmaterials used is measured from drawings and design specifications and a material life cycle \ninventory for the building is established (Table 2). Bath ICE dataset [20] has been primarily \nused to estimate the embodied impact of most of the materials with the exception of cladding \nsystems and glazed windows and doors where  Simapro [21], manufacturer\u2019 data and in house \ncalculations based on general industry practice have been used. Though Bath ICE [20] is a \nlimited inventory, yet it is one of the most useful generic data source for a range of building \nmaterials in the UK. In the future, it is expected that more specific, geographically relevant \nand publicly accessible product data could be obtained from manufacturers and suppliers in \nthe form of environmental product declaration (EPD). This could further improve the level of \ncomparability in calculations between different types of materials by addressing the    \nlimitations in data gaps.  \nAs shown in table 2, the embodied energy of concrete (in situ, paving and precast) and steel \n(superstructure and doors) represents the largest component (46.23% and 34.21% \nrespectively) in the building\u2019s total material burden. Embodied energy of the building \nenvelope\u2019s materials (roof, wall and parapet claddings) represents a lower but significant \nproportion (16.81%) of the building\u2019s total burden excluding parapet wall. \n 5. Results  \nTo investigate the effect of different design options on the energy demand of the building, a \nseries of parametric environmental analysis was carried out using Ecotect computer \nsimulation program [19]. The heating (operational) load of the building has been calculated \nby taking into account the level of occupancy, working patterns, building characteristics and \nthe local climate. Table 3 shows the variation in heating loads for different roof light ratios \nunder different insulation levels. Roof light area was increased from 15% (base case) to 30% \nand 50%. By increasing the thickness of insulation, the U-Values of roof and external walls \nwere improved by 50% and 70% from the base case scenario.  The operational (heating) and \nembodied impacts of the building were recalculated to accommodate for the changes in the \nenvelope (Table 4). \nIncreased roof light areas resulted in higher levels of daylight availability as expected. Table 5 \nlists the calculated average daylight factors and the equivalent daylight levels for different \nroof configurations. When roof light is 30% of roof area, the calculated light level in the \nwarehouse and the workshops exceed the level of 200 lux as prescribed in CIBSE (Chartered \nInstitute of Building Services Engineer) Guide F [25]. Increasing RLR would result in better \nlighting environment and potentially reduced electric lighting load. However increased RLR \nmay increase the heating load as illustrated in table 3. This is mainly due to the lower thermal \nresistance of roof lights when compared with the opaque fabric of the envelope.  \n5.1. Embodied and heating emissions over the design life  \nIn reality many parameters could influence the projected emissions over the design life of \nbuildings as there are dynamic conditions in every phase of a building\u2019s life that could \ninfluence the balance of impacts. The energy and material demand results presented in this \nstudy are largely related to a particular building type within defined assumptions on building \noperational characteristics.  \nTo assess life cycle distribution of emissions of the building in this study, the increase in \nembodied impact emissions were compared with changes in the operational (heating) \nemissions over the 25 years for the three different scenarios (Table 4 and Figure 2). DEFRA \n[26] conversion factor for gas has been used to calculate the heating emissions in this study.  \nThe overall net operational emissions saving for the whole design life due to the added \ninsulation for the case with 15% roof light is 6% and 11.6% for the medium and high \ninsulation compared with low insulation respectively. However the extra insulation resulted in \nhigher embodied impact of the order of 12.4 % and 24.5% for the medium and high insulation \ncompared with low insulation respectively. For 30% roof light, it is 3.1% and 8.9% \noperational savings and 10.9% and 21.7% extra spent on embodied. For 50 % roof light, this \nis 2.9 % and 8.8 % operational savings and 9.1% and 18.1% extra embodied spent.  \nThe difference between the embodied and the design life operational (heating) impact \nillustrates that the decisions to address building emissions should be made on its relative \ndifferences.  Theoretically, it suggests that if saving operational energy (and operational \nimpact) is prioritized then improving the levels of insulation (and added embodied energy) \nmay be justified. However, other factors like cost, payback and performance considerations \ncome into play while making any decisions.  The result of this comparison underlines the \nemissions savings achieved by the adequate thermal insulation of the envelope. It could be \nseen that the energy embodied in the building materials (including improving insulation) can \nbe a highly significant part of life cycle energy consumption. For this study, it was only \npossible to model the heating load over the design life of the building however, the \nimportance of embodied energy would be greater with the continuing reductions in building \noperational energy consumption due to more stringent codes and standards. There might be \nfinancial benefits initially in making a trade-off in low insulation levels (low embodied) with \nhigh insulation (higher embodied) however any procurement decision has to be based on the \nwhole life impacts analysis. It is important to note that the results presented here to a large \nextent depends on the design life of the building as the balance of embodied and operational \nemissions will change with a longer design life.  \n5.2 Alternatives materials \nGenerally during the initial stages of design, the project team have an opportunity to reduce \nthe embodied impacts of the building through reducing material use, waste minimisation, \nspecifying higher recycled content (and recyclability) and specifying alternative materials \nwith a lower embodied carbon per weight of material. \nTable 6 presents an example of material substitutions which has the potential to reduce the \nembodied carbon of the case study building construction. This list is limited as only the \nprimary materials like steel, concrete and cladding systems are compared.  It is anticipated \nthat the use of different concrete types with 50% ground granulated blast furnace slag \n(GGBS) content would have a potential for further emissions savings [20]. Production of \ntypical UK steel used in construction requires substantial energy however significantly less \nenergy is required to produce products using secondary steel with higher recycled content \n[20]. These substitutions emphasise the need to consider both energy intensity and recycling \npotential of the materials to minimize the use of energy and resources over an extended length \nof time [27]. \nThe other alternatives considered are replacing steel wall cladding with timber cladding and \nhemcrete walling system.  The results provide an insight into the effect of the type of \nconstruction on the amount of CO2 emissions, and into the possibilities for carbon \nsequestration. By changing the cladding the U-Values were kept the same as indicated in \nTable 1.  \nTimber cladding would reduce the embodied carbon impact of the wall cladding from 121.07 \nton of CO2 (for steel) to 99.06 ton of CO2 resulting in a saving of 18.8% without considering \nthe carbon lock in benefits of timber [20].  Hemcrete is essentially a blend of hemp shiv and a \nspecial lime based binder and could be used in an array of applications from roof insulation to \nwall construction and flooring. Hemcrete is a highly insulating material with an improved \nthermal inertia and vapour permeability that makes it quite a unique and sustainable \nconstruction product. Without sequestration, the hemcrete walling has a much higher impact \n(290.93 ton of CO2) [28] compared to steel and timber cladding systems.  This is mainly due \nto the presence of lime and cement in the binder.  \nThe embodied impacts of biotic materials might drastically change if their sequestration \npotential is considered. The lower fossil fuel energy required for processing of biotic materials \ntogether with the locked in carbon benefits makes timber and hemcrete walling systems much \nbetter choices compared to steel cladding.  Embodied emissions associated with these biotic \nmaterials for both with and without sequestration are presented in Table 6 and illustrated in \nFigure 3. Sequestered carbon in timber results in reduction of the embodied cladding impact to \n13.48 ton of CO2, however if the sequestration property of hemcrete is taken into account that \nresults in an overall negative embodied impact (-218.82 ton of CO2) of the walling system [28]. \nThe weight of hemcrete used in walling system is quite high compared to timber cladding \nsystem and thus their sequestration benefit varies considerably.  However it is important to \nnote that the quantitative knowledge on biotic products (cradle to grave perspective) about the \neffects of energy and carbon balances appears to be limited. This is especially true as the global \nassessment on released carbon (through soil disturbance) due to management and harvesting \noperations is relatively unknown. It can be argued that the carbon locking benefits of timber \ncould only be justified if the timber is sourced from a legally certified source that ensures a \ncorresponding increase in the forestry area for long term sustainable management.  \nIn essence, a building is a complicated system mainly due to a complex product base, functions \nand a limited service life of its components and changing user requirements. In order to reduce \nthe life cycle emissions of  buildings, it is of great importance in the design phase to not only \nfocus on reducing the operational energy but also to make informed decision based on low \nembodied materials,  maintenance cycle as well as the recycling\/reuse potential.  \n6. Conclusion \nTotal performance of a building and its whole life emissions is the result of a complex and \ninterrelated system influence by climate, design, construction, materials used, operational \nregimes and the decisions made at the end of life stage. Importance of making the best \ndecisions in the early stages of a design can reduce the capital cost of integrating low \nenvironmental impact, recycled or innovative materials and can reduce overall life cycle \nemissions [17].   \nConsidered selection of materials and design can save energy, and reduce CO2 emissions \nacross the life cycle of buildings. This study investigates the additional insulation and change \nin rooflight ratio as an energy efficiency measure in an industrial warehouse in life cycle \nterms. In addition, material substitution and alternative cladding systems have been \ninvestigated to lower the building life cycle impacts. An attempt has been made to \ndemonstrate that an integral building analysis considering both life cycle and operational \nsimulations would be quite useful in achieving whole life building sustainability.  \nAn intensive integral modeling investigating the relative values of embodied and operational \nimpacts is time consuming and rarely utilized in the building industry. Dynamic building \nenergy simulation models can be used to consider operational emissions, however \nsimultaneous modeling of embodied burdens to model the whole life energy performance of \nbuilding elements and systems will allow the design team to make a more considered \nproposal. Optimization of the design to minimize both operational and embodied impacts over \nbuilding life should lead the design team to identify the most effective solutions. If utilized in \npractice in the construction industry, this form of modeling would not be able to avoid the \nvariable of cost. Further study may have included structural and services design options. An \nadditional limitation is the confidence held in the ability of any building emission modeling \nsoftware to effectively model the operational loads of the building with variables and \nparameters offered. Similarly, the accuracy of quantities and completeness of data when \nmodeling embodied burdens can distort results.  \nTwo key areas of significance are provided here; firstly, by the variation in result that is \ndemonstrated when LCA boundaries are changed as in the inclusion of sequestration from \nbiotic materials. It is important that the construction industry is able to make similar studies \nquickly and rigorously using a standard for calculating the impact of the materials, secondly, \nthat embodied burden is perhaps more than is generally assumed, and that in short lifespan \ncommercial buildings like distribution centers may become a major concern of the \nconstruction industry as legislation and targets for operational emissions to be reduced in the \nfuture. Further software development will be vital to ensure this can be achieved accurately \nand economically.  \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Asif M, Muneer T, Kelley R.
