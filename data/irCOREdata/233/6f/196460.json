But knowing that the\nturmoil of reform in China in the 1900s dramatically overshadowed the age of\nreform in the United States in the same period prompts a contemporary compari-\nson. After all, the American century that got properly underway following World\nWar I could well be succeeded by the Chinese century. The relative scale of their\nrespective prehistories is evident in the three hundred years covered by Art in\nAmerica, compared with the five thousand years of exhibits in the permanent col-\nlection of the Shanghai Museum. The extent of routine mobile phone use in\nNumber 1, 2 and 3 galleries of the Shanghai Museum probably tells us something of\nwhat is to come, as well.\nArt in America is the first comprehensive survey of American art to exhibit in\nmainland China, and it came to the economic hothouse that is Shanghai after opening\nin Beijing at the National Museum of Fine Arts. There are echoes in the show\u2019s\nnational narrative, cued as it is to the four hundredth anniversary of the Jamestown\nsettlement, of the cultural campaigns of the Cold War. The exhibition is on a\n\u2018\u2018diplomatic mission\u2019\u2019, according to the introductory wall caption. Yet there is far\nmore national self-criticism in 2007 than in the exhibitions that toured the US\nand Europe in the 1950s ; there needs to be, if bridges are to be rebuilt across the\nworld in the desperate aftermath of a military victory in Iraq. Colonization and\nwestward expansion thematically link paintings by Gustavus Hesselius (Tishcohan,\n1735), Benjamin West (Penn\u2019s Treaty with the Indians, 1771\u201372), George Caleb\nBingham (Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap, 1851\u201352)\nand William Matthew Prior (Young Boy Holding a Bow and Arrow with a Drum on the\nFloor, 1856). While George Innes\u2019s Twilight (c.1860), Albert Bierstadt\u2019s Sierra Nevada\n(c.1871) and Martin Johnson Heade\u2019s Newburyport Marshes : Approaching Storm (c.1871),\nwhich all depict versions of American pastoral or the sublime, are countered, on the\nwall opposite Gallery Number 1, by John Weir\u2019s The Gun Foundry (1866), with its\nDouglas Tallack is Professor of American Studies and Pro-Vice-Chancellor at the University\nof Nottingham, Nottingham, NG7 2RD, UK.\nJournal of American Studies, 42 (2008), 1, 141\u2013147 f 2008 Cambridge University Press\ndoi:10.1017\/S0021875807004410 Printed in the United Kingdom\nhellish scenes of molten iron and exploited workers ; Charles M. Russell\u2019s scene of\ncruelty in Wild Horse Hunters (1913) ; and Frederick S. Remington\u2019s depiction of\nend-of-epoch weariness, The Fall of the Cowboy (1895). There are also some quite\nshocking paintings that rarely figure in surveys of American art. Joe Jones\u2019s White\nJustice (American Justice) (1933) shows, in a naive style, a Ku Klux Klan lynching of a\nbare-breasted black woman, her house burning in the background. Thomas Hart\nBenton\u2019s neglected American Historical Epic (Second Chapter) (1924\u201327) is a heightened\nmix of reactionary populism, lasciviousness and technological advance. It is difficult\nto say whether its five panels portray an epic of progress or of regress into barbar-\nism. And then there is the implied militarism of The Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty :\nEnlightening the World (1886), by Edward P. Moran. Events of the American century\nthat, some would maintain, got under way two decades before World War I, with\nimperialist adventures in the Philippines, retrospectively inform and interestingly\ndistort Moran\u2019s depiction of a celebratory event. It comes across more as a sea battle\nwith smoke billowing out around the foot of Liberty.\nYet context works both ways to inform and distort. The evocative sunset of\nwavering stars and stripes in Frederic Edwin Church\u2019s Our Banner in the Sky (1861)\nis subtle, compared with the barrage \u2013 in so much Chinese art and life \u2013 of\nflags and other symbols of one-party nationalism seeking to control and harness\nWestern capitalism in a much less liberal \u2018\u2018great experiment. \u2019\u2019 The astonishing\neconomic, market-driven transformation going on in the street outside the Shanghai\nMuseum \u2013 a sign of hope rather than fear for many Western, liberal eyes \u2013 gives\nan extra dimension to the goods coming ashore in the background of West\u2019s\nPenn\u2019s Treaty with the Indians and to the scene of local trade in Thomas Waterman\nWood\u2019s The Yankee Pedlar (1872).\nAs noted, the curators have made an effort to include a large number of over-\nlooked works, including one by Yun Gee, an immigrant from Guangdong Province\nwho set up the Chinese Revolutionary Artists Club in San Francisco in 1926. His\nseven-foot-high Wheels : Industrial New York (1932) is a strange mix of skyscrapers,\nindustrial plant, out-of-scale graffiti, an airplane out of Fritz Lang\u2019s Metropolis and\na circling group of polo-players, who resemble circus warriors on horses. Yun Gee\u2019s\npainting is also one of the few paintings to show abstraction and representationalism\ncompeting with each other to convey the material base and sheer superstructural\nenergy of modernity in America. Elsewhere, the art-historical story jumps too ab-\nruptly from realism to modernism, from Frank Benson\u2019s Lady Trying on a Hat\n(The Black Hat) (1904) and the Impressionist variants of Childe Hassan, Ernest\nLawson and Robert Reid, to Lionel Feininger and Max Weber. This is largely be-\ncause the works chosen to represent the Ashcan School are not in the mode of\nGeorge Bellows\u2019s almost \u2018\u2018flat \u2019\u2019 but extraordinarily exciting painterly explosion,\nNew York (1911), but of William Glackens\u2019s Victorian interior scene, The Shoppers,\nof 1907\u20138. And ethnically interesting though they are, Henri\u2019s portraits, Chinese\nWoman and Gregorita (n.d.), needed, for company, his Street Scene with Snow (57th Street\nNYC) (1902), in which modernist formal techniques are enlisted as appropriate for\nstreet scenes rendered indistinct by a concoction of industrial smoke, adverse\nweather and buildings that inconveniently block a clear point of view. Instead,\nwe jump from the society portraits of Frederick Frieseke, Richard E. Miller and\nJohn Singer Sargent to Marsden Hartley\u2019s Painting No 50 (1914\u201315) and onward to\n142 Review Essay\nthe post-Impressionism of Maurice Prendergast, and then to a Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\ncloseup, Red Poppy VI from 1928.\nIn the story of politics-and-aesthetics that Art in America relates more obliquely\nthan did the Cold War exhibitions of half a century ago, abstraction is very\nfavourably treated. There is a passing comment, reminiscent of mid-twentieth-\ncentury accounts of the non-ideological independence of the Abstract Expressionists.\nA swipe is taken, in a wall caption in the gallery containing Thomas Hart Benton and\nGrant Wood, at\nregionalist realism_ identified, after World War Two, as an ideology as well as a style,\nwith some works reflecting a detested propagandist agenda. Consequently, abstraction\ntriumphed over all expressions of modernity, and, ironically, came also to be understood\nas a political belief that was illustrative of freedom of expression in a democratic society.\nThere is, though, an arbitrary quality to the Abstract Expressionist works in the\nexhibition that undermines such a claim. Jackson Pollock\u2019s Number 18 (1950) is so\ndelicate, so personal and so very small that there must have been a great deal of\npaint, as well as democratic expression, left on his garage floor. None of Rothko\u2019s\nenveloping sombreness is on show in his one painting, and therefore he comes\nacross as a too smiling and acquiescent contributor to the triumph of American art.\nSome of Clyfford Still\u2019s intimations of violence are conveyed by the jagged landscape\nof Untitled (1964), while an untitled work by Franz Kline of 1952 hints at a conver-\ngence of Chinese hieroglyphics and Western abstraction. Art in America reflects the\ncanonical status of these mid-century, late Modernists, but gives ample credit for the\nfirst innovations to the equally varied period of early American Modernism: Max\nWeber\u2019s dynamically clashing shapes in Rush-Hour New York (1915), Charles\nDemuth\u2019s Welcome to Our City (1921), Archibald J. Motley, Jr.\u2019s Saturday Night (1935)\nand Arthur Dove\u2019s Alfie\u2019s Delight (1929) stand out. Only Edward Hopper, with Dawn\nin Pennsylvania (1942), can live with these Modernists.\nThe incidence of text in artworks that becomes such an explicit interest\nin American art with Demuth, but also Stuart Davis and other Modernists, appears\nin very different form much earlier, for instance in Richard Goodwin\u2019s Wild Game\nin the Kitchen (1855), with an almanac from 1822 prominently featured. The line\nof visual experimentation runs through the 1890s trompe l\u2019oeil painters, John\nFrederick Peto and William Harnett, though none of their curious works are in-\ncluded, and through many of the Ashcan artists, in whose works we can discern the\nshift from texts as part of the scene painted to painted text. Demuth\u2019sWelcome to Our\nCity is the clearest link in this exhibition, though, between early Modernist exper-\nimentation with the meaning of letters and words in visual art to the full-on use of\ntext as art.\nThe New York conceptual artist Lawrence Weiner has experimented throughout\nhis career with different locations, with the coincidence of title and artwork, and with\ntranslations into different languages. To See and Be Seen (1972) attracted attention\nbecause of the site-specific alterations. The words run vertically up a pillar in Gallery\nNumber 2, but on a different side of the pillar the work incorporates a Chinese\ntranslation :\nReview Essay 143\nThese Chinese characters carry at least the following variations :\nWhat you see is also seen by others,\nor\nYou see others and you are seen by others.\nArguably, the greatest interest in the English phrase is the causal connection in the\nword \u2018\u2018and \u2019\u2019, but in Chinese there is greater ambiguity and richness, though the\nsubject matter \u2013 language \u2013 potentially allows for expansion of meanings, even in\nadvance of these latest two moves of translation (into Chinese) and relocation (to a\nnew place, the Shanghai Museum).\nThe grand intercultural comparisons and contrasts initiated by a major American\nart exhibition coming to China in its period of contradictory opening up can co-\nalesce around an artwork such as Weiner\u2019s. And around Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s\nGRRRRRRRRRRR! ! (1965). It was intriguing to stand in front of this cartoon-style\ndepiction of a fierce wolf, with the sound it is apparently making included, in visual\nwritten form, in the image, as well as on the title caption, and hear Chinese visitors\narticulating the sound made by a threatening wolf. It sounded nothing like\n\u2018\u2018grrrrrrrrrrr \u2019\u2019 to me.\nIt is hardly surprising that there has been a coming together of an ancient\nChinese tradition of calligraphy, which embraces the confluence of pictographic,\nideographic and arbitrary signs, and an interest in text as image. Reviews of\nArt in America in Shanghai newspapers, and commentary from academics,\nhave remarked on the interest in this tradition, and the overlapping one of collage\nand assemblage, represented in this exhibition by Robert Rauschenberg\u2019s Barge\n(1962). In a review of Art in America in the Oriental Morning Post, Chen Yi reports\nthat when\nasked about the artwork that has left the deepest impression on them, a group of faculty\nmembers from Shandong College of Art and Design mention in unison the work of Robert\nRauschenberg. Standing in front of the \u2018\u2018Barge \u2019\u2019, they were brought back to the \u2018\u2018 trend of\n1985 \u2019\u2019, when Chinese artists were tired of the Russian tradition and were eager to seek in-\nspiration from modern Western art. To further propel such a trend, Robert Rauschenberg\nheld his solo exhibitions in Beijing and Lhasa in succession. After a brief moment of shock,\nyoung Chinese artists retraced the path of more than one hundred years of Western modern\nart within a short period of time, a process comparable to the American borrowing of Parisian\nimpressionism.1\nThe sheer sweep of Art in America, with its desire to inform and to explain the\nUnited States to a new and important audience, can only prepare for subsequent\nstages in a most welcome cultural interaction. Individual Chinese and American\nartists, particularly since the 1980s, are turning out to have a good deal in common,\nas vanguard cities such as Shanghai and New York confront local and\nglobal imperatives, as the contradictory politics and aesthetics of city and country\n1 Chen Yi, \u2018\u2018300 Years of American Art, \u2019\u2019 Oriental Morning Post, 17 May 2007, http :\/\/\nwww.hwxart.com.
