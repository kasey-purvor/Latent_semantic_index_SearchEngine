These techniques do not\nsupply information on the macromolecular composition\nin the image contrast, whereas spectroscopy based tech-\nniques do, and hence 3D IR imaging would provide a use-\nful and novel alternative with the advantage of image\ncontrast based directly on the underlying macromolecular\ncomposition. The lack of penetration of mid IR radiation\ninto tissue precludes real time imaging of whole samples\nbut an alternative is to build a composite from 2D images\nof adjacent sections of tissue thus providing a method to\ngauge the extent and penetration of disease, which may be\nof clinical value. This has the advantage of not requiring a\nchemical or immunological staining protocol to provide\nbiochemical information. High-speed low-cost comput-\ners, in combination with infrared imaging instruments\nbased on Focal Plane Array (FPA) detectors, allow the\nimage acquisition and reconstruction to be achieved\nwithin a reasonable time frame.\nThe adaptation of multi-channel infrared array detectors\nfrom military hardware to FTIR microscopes in the early\n1990s resulted in new methodologies to investigate the\nmacromolecular architecture of cells in tissue sections [1].\nThe new generation of FPA and more recently linear array\ndetectors are capable of recording thousands of spectra in\nrapid time. Each pixel is essentially a digital hyper-spectral\ndata cube containing absorbance, wavenumber and x,y\nspatial coordinates. Univariate or chemical maps can be\nplotted based on peak height, integrated areas under spe-\ncific bands or band ratios. While these maps provide spa-\ntial information on the distribution and relative\nconcentration of the major macromolecules they are not\nuseful in correlating anatomical and histopathological\nfeatures with corresponding spectral profiles [2]. Multi-\nvariate imaging techniques including Unsupervised Hier-\narchical Cluster Analysis (UHCA) [2-9], K-means\nclustering [8,10], Principal Components Analysis (PCA)\n[11], Linear Discriminant Analysis [12], Fuzzy C-means\nclustering [8,13] and neural networks [11] have proven to\nbe invaluable in the identification of spectral groups or\n\"clusters\" which can be directly compared to stained tis-\nsue sections. In multivariate methods, the information of\nthe entire spectrum can be utilized for the analysis. The\nfirst part of the analysis requires a distance matrix to be\ncalculated. This can be achieved using a number of differ-\nent algorithms including D-values (Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient), Euclidean distances, normalized Euclidean\ndistances, Euclidean squared distances and City Block all\nof which are available in the Cytospec\u2122 software package\n[14] and appear to produce similar cluster maps although\nthe time taken for each method can vary. We used the D-\nvalues method because this is a well-established linear\nregression method that is suited to relative concentration\ndata. One disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is com-\nputationally more demanding than others; therefore\nmore time is required for the distance matrix calculation.\nIn cluster analysis a measure of similarity is established for\neach class of related spectra and a mean characteristic\nspectrum can be extracted for each class. In the final step,\nall spectra in a cluster are assigned the same color. In the\nfalse color maps, the assigned color for each spectral clus-\nter is displayed at the coordinates at which each data cube\nwas collected. The mean spectrum of a cluster represents\nall spectra in a cluster and can be used for the interpreta-\ntion of the chemical or biochemical differences between\nclusters. There are also a variety of algorithms to select\nfrom to perform cluster analysis, including Ward's algo-\nrithm, which we employ because it minimizes the hetero-\ngeneity of the clusters.\nThe high correlation of spectral clusters with anatomical\nand histopathological features has been conclusively\ndemonstrated for a number of different tissue types\nincluding cervical [2,3], breast [10,15], liver [4,7], brain\n[5], mouth [6], intestine [8,16], skin [17], bone [18,19],\ncornea [20] and prostate [21]. Hitherto FTIR multivariate\nimaging has been mainly restricted to the generation of\n2D cluster maps. The exception is Mendelsohn and cow-\norkers [22] who constructed a 3D univariate map of corti-\ncal bone based on peak ratios from serial two-\ndimensional sections. By interfacing two types of software\nnamely Cytospec [14] and SCIRun [23] and writing a sim-\nple \"stitching\" algorithm we are able to generate 3D mul-\ntivariate cluster maps from multiple tissue sections. The\nability to visualize 3D FTIR cluster maps provides a new\navenue to assess variation in multiple tissue sections and\nto determine the penetration of histopathological struc-\ntures based on the underlying macromolecular structure\nof the diseased tissue.\nMethods\nFollowing approval from the Royal Women's Hospital\nResearch and Human Research Ethics Committees and\nthe Monash University Standing Committee on Ethics in\nResearch Involving Humans, written, informed preopera-\ntive consent was obtained from the patient and a cervical\ntissue sample exhibiting villoglandular adenocarcinoma\nwas then obtained by cone biopsy. The tissue sample was\nthen embedded in a paraffin block and sliced by micro-\ntome into 4 \u03bcm sections. One group of four sections was\nmounted on glass slides and stained with the routine his-\ntopathology stain Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for light\nmicroscope examination. Hematoxylin has an affinity\nwith nucleic acids and Eosin has an affinity for the cellular\ncytoplasm. An adjacent group of four sections was depar-\naffinized, mounted on Kevley\u2122 \"low e\" IR reflectivePage 2 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2006, 6:12 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/6\/12microscope slides and imaged with a Varian Stingray FTIR\nmicroscope system equipped with a 64 \u00d7 64 pixel HgCdTe\nliquid nitrogen cooled FPA with a 15\u00d7 Cassegrain objec-\ntive. FTIR hyper-spectral data images were recorded in the\nrange 4000-950 cm-1 at 6 cm-1 resolution and with 16\nscans co-added. For each of the four sections, step-motion\ncontrol of the microscope stage was used to construct a 16\ntile (4 \u00d7 4) FTIR image mosaic from FPA recordings col-\nlected as 16 pixel aggregates. Thus the spatial resolution\nobtained is approximately 22 \u03bcm per pixel aggregate. Each\nFTIR image was therefore 2.0 mm2 in area and with the\nfour 4 \u03bcm thick adjacent sections giving a total sampled\nvolume of 1,400 \u00d7 1,400 \u00d7 16 \u03bcm. A spatial resolution of\n22 \u03bcm per pixel was used as this provided FTIR images\nthat covered an area of tissue large enough to encompass\nseveral examples of anatomically different tissue types.\nUsing a MATLAB\u00ae routine developed by our group, the\nfour FTIR images were stitched together side by side (or\n\"unfolded\") to give a single large 2D image frame (see\nadditional file 1 \"cyto4fs.m\" a program for stitching mul-\ntiple tissue sections together for use in Cytospec\u2122 spectro-\nscopic software). The absorbance was integrated over a\nlarge spectral region (1750-950 cm-1) to assess sample\nthickness using a routine in Cytospec\u2122. This avoids inac-\ncuracies with too thin samples with low absorbance or too\nhigh absorbance that result in non-linear detector\nresponse. A spectrum is rejected if the determined integra-\ntion value is higher or lower than a pre-defined threshold\n(1500 and 50 arbitrary units). Spectra that passed the\nthickness quality test were converted to second derivative\nspectra using a Savitsky-Golay algorithm (13 smoothing\npoints). UHCA (D-values, Ward's algorithm) was per-\nformed to generate 4 clusters from second derivative spec-\ntra over the 1272-950 cm-1 spectral window. The resultant\ncluster map was then reorganized (or \"back folded\") into\nthe four individual 2D cluster maps, each map corre-\nsponding to one of the FTIR images. The four cluster maps\nwere saved in an image file format with a unique false\ncolor assigned to each cluster and then aligned or \"regis-\ntered\" as separate floating layers of a single image in the\nGIMP [24] image-processing program. This registration\nstep is necessary as the sample orientation was not identi-\ncal in both rotation and translation on each of the four\nacquired 2D mosaic images. Proper pixel correspondence\nfrom one image to another was easily achieved using this\nmanual approach given the small number of image layers.\nThe registered layers constituted a best fit because some\nslightly unequal distortion of the tissue matrix was\nobserved presumably caused by the sectioning and prepa-\nration processes. For this 3D imaging technique, special\ncare must be taken to ensure the sections are not stretched\nor distorted when deposited onto the slides.\nThe SCIRun [23] software suite provides a graphical user\ninterface for rapid development of \"networks\" of instruc-\ntion routines for the stacking and rendering of the input\ndata (see additional file 2 \"SCIRun adenocarcinoma.net\"\nfor the 3D image processing program modules and con-\nfiguration parameters for SCIRun). The registered images\nwere loaded into SCIRun as a set of indexed integer values\n(1 to 4 corresponding to each cluster) and then \"stacked\"\ninto a scalar volume field of cluster values from which the\n3D cluster maps were rendered.\n3D univariate chemical maps depicting a single spectral\nfeature were also generated. The spectra were vector nor-\nmalized over the 1800-950 cm-1 range and then integrated\nunder the absorbance band of interest using a trapezoidal\nbaseline function in Cytospec\u2122. The 3D univariate maps\nwere rendered from a scalar volume field of absorbance\nvalues generated from 2D FTIR images stacked in SCIRun.\nThe 3D univariate maps were plotted with a 256 rainbow\ncolor palette using Gaussian interpolation between the\ndata grid points to produce a smoothly varying color field.\nThe 3D cluster maps, on the other hand, were plotted in a\npalette of only 4 false colors and box interpolated, with\none false color corresponding to each cluster. Figure 1\ndepicts a schematic of the overall process from spectral\nacquisition to 3D image reconstruction.\nResults and discussion\nFigure 2 shows a H&E stained 2D cervical section exhibit-\ning a relatively rare form of neoplasm known as villoglan-\ndular adenocarcinoma. The neoplasm is characterized by\nthe presence of long villous fronds and papillae lined by\ncolumnar cells with intact cytoplasmic borders and dis-\nplays minimal atypia. [25] Spherical clusters of cells with\nsmooth intact communal cytoplasmic rings are also asso-\nciated with this condition [25]. The sample makes an\nideal model for 3D unsupervised hierarchical cluster anal-\nysis because it exhibits a variety of anatomical and his-\ntopathological features, including connective tissue, red\nblood cells, inflammatory exudate and glandular cells.\nFigure 3a depicts a chemical map generated from all four\nsections simultaneously by integrating the area under the\nband in 1275-1190 cm-1 region associated mainly with\nphosphodiester contributions form nucleic acids. The\nchemical maps show a good correlation with morphol-\nogy; however, specific correlations with anatomical and\nhistopathological features cannot be gauged with this\nform of processing.\nIt is necessary to perform UHCA over the entire set of spec-\ntra collected to fully characterize the range of spectral var-\niations through all the tissue sections. Performing\nseparate UHCA on each individual tissue section would\ngive a different clustering result due to changes (although\ngenerally small) in the biochemical composition betweenPage 3 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2006, 6:12 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/6\/12sections. For this reason the images were \"stitched\"\ntogether into a single frame to enable spectral pre-process-\ning and UHCA to be performed in Cytospec\u2122 on all spec-\ntra from all images simultaneously. UHCA was performed\non the 1272-950 cm-1 region on second derivative vector\nnormalized spectra simultaneously on four adjacent sec-\ntions and the resultant cluster maps are displayed in figure\n3b. The cluster maps show a general similarity and suc-\ncessfully highlight the major anatomical features. The\norange cluster represents red blood cells embedded in the\nstromal matrix. The light green cluster is predominantly\nstroma, while the brown is mainly lymphocyte exudates.\nThe blue cluster is predominantly glandular tissue. In tis-\nsue sections 3 and 4 there is an increase in the area of con-\nnective tissue (green cluster) relative to glandular tissue\n(blue cluster) when compared to sections 1 and 2 indicat-\ning penetration of the glandular tissue into the connective\nlayer.\nFigure 4 shows the raw and second derivative mean\nextracted spectra color coded the same as the clusters in\nfigure 3b. The maps and corresponding spectra are very\nsimilar for each section indicating that the biochemistry\nbetween the adjacent sections is consistent. The spectra\nexhibit dramatic changes in the amide I mode both in\nterms of bandwidth and position. The peak center varies\nfrom approximately 1643 cm-1 to 1659 cm-1. This varia-\ntion is attributed to physical-chemical changes in the tis-\nsue matrix. Dramatic variation occurs in areas of thin\ntissue and on the periphery of tissue sections with the net\nresult a shifting of the amide I mode along with a concom-\nitant increase in the amide II\/amide I ratio. This effect is\nclearly observed in the mean extracted spectrum from the\nbrown cluster which shows the amide I mode appearing\nat 1643 cm-1 and an amide II\/amide I ratio that is much\ngreater for this spectrum when compared to the other\nspectra. Such strong distortions and shifts in band shape\nwere recently addressed by Romeo et al. [9] who reported\nLight micrograph of a labeled H&E stained cervical section ex ibiting villoglandular ad nocarcinomaFi ure 2\nLight micrograph of a labeled H&E stained cervical section \nexhibiting villoglandular adenocarcinoma.\nSchematic showing steps in the construction of 3D FTIR mul-tivariate imagesFigure 1\nSchematic showing steps in the construction of 3D FTIR mul-\ntivariate images.Page 4 of 9\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Medical Imaging 2006, 6:12 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2342\/6\/12a method to correct for the \"dispersion artifact\". To mini-\nmize correlations with physical information the analysis\nwas carried out using the 1272-950 cm-1 region, which\nomits the proteinaceous range (1720-1380 cm-1) that may\nbe strongly distorted by the dispersion artifact. Spectra\nfrom lymphocyte exudates and glandular tissue are dom-\ninated by a band at ~1240 cm-1 which is assigned to the\nasymmetric phosphodiester stretching vibration of\nnucleic acids. This band shows the most variation\nbetween all 4 mean extracted cluster spectra. The mean\nextracted spectrum from the stromal areas (light green)\nhas contributions from collagen vibrations although the\ndistinctive collagen triplet in the 1300-1200 cm-1 cannot\nbe observed due to infiltration by red blood cells, lym-\nphocyte exudates and glandular tissue into the connective\nlayer.\nThe 3D chemical image constructed from 4 adjacent sec-\ntions and generated by integrating the area underneath\nthe peaks in the 1272-950 cm-1 region is presented in fig-\nure 5. In figure 5a the image is orientated to show the first\nsection of the tissue block (section 1) while in figure 5b\nthe last section (section 4) is oriented towards the viewer.\nThe darkest orange areas in section 1 (figure 5a) correlate\nwell with the stroma and glandular tissue while the dark-\nest orange area shown in section 4 (figure 5b) is associated\nmainly with the stroma.\nFigure 6 shows a 3D UHCA map performed on the 4 sec-\ntions simultaneously. The map shows excellent correla-\ntion with the anatomical and histopathological features\nindicated in figure 2. The cluster colors are the same as\nthose used in figure 3b. The 3D UHCA map enables one\nto visualize the extent of penetration of the anatomical\nfeatures and the degree of variation from section to sec-\ntion (see additional file 3: movie_adeno1.mpg for a rotat-\ning movie of this image). Moreover, 3D FTIR multivariate\nprocessing enables visualization of thick tissue sections\nthat cannot normally be analyzed using conventional mid\nIR spectroscopic techniques due to the limited depth pen-\netration of IR radiation. The thin sections (4 \u03bcm) required\nfor use with the Kevley slides are less than the thickness of\na single cervical cell consequently multiple sections ena-\nble the analysis of whole cells and also minimizes the\neffects of orientation artifacts that can arise during tissue\nsectioning.

In approxi-\nmately 1 hour a 3D movie, which are composed of a few\nhundred individual 3D image frames can be produced in\nSCIRun.\nThe production of 3D UHCA cluster images is a signifi-\ncantly slower process than generating univariate 3D maps\nbecause in addition to the steps delineated above for uni-\nvariate maps UHCA must be performed. UHCA is compu-\ntationally intensive and requires approximately 2 hours\n(Pentium 4, 3.4 GHz, Hyper-Threading, 2 Gb RAM) for\nthe processing of four FTIR images stitched together.\nCompilation of UHCA 2D maps from large collections of\ntissue sections would be prohibitively slow for the current\ntechnique to have value as a rapid diagnostic tool. We are\ncurrently testing an artificial neural network alternative to\nUHCA.\nFTIR imaging is resolution limited by diffraction to scales\non the order of a few microns and hence, it is not always\npossible to unambiguously assign the obtained spectro-\nscopic information as unique to particular sub-cellular\nstructures. Nevertheless, FTIR imaging does provide valu-\nable information on the overall biochemical composition\nwhen applied to tissue structures that are larger than a few\nmicrons in extent. The multivariate spectroscopic 3D-\nimaging method described in this work could be readily\nadapted for use with other emerging biophotonics tech-\nniques, most particularly Raman spectroscopic mapping\nwhich can provide macromolecular information on sub-\ncellular length scales.\nConclusion\nThe coupling of vibrational spectroscopy with 3D multi-\nvariate processing greatly extends the capabilities of this\ntechnology in medical diagnostics. From a biomedical\nperspective existing pathological and histochemical pro-\ntocols depend on sample morphology and visualization.\nTherefore the ability to maintain spatial integrity in three\ndimensions while assessing precise spectroscopic data\nintrinsic to a tissue sample represents an ideal combina-\ntion. Three-dimensional multivariate processing provides\na new way of visualizing tissue blocks based on the under-\nlying biochemistry of the tissue matrix and will therefore\nhave significant application in biology and medicine.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nBRW conceived of the study, and participated in its design\nand coordination and helped to draft the manuscript.
