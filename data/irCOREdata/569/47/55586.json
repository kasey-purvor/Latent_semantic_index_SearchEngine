As\nenergetic particles precipitate into the upper atmosphere\nthey enhance in situ ionization rates [Siskind, 2000], and this\nresults in chemical composition changes as odd nitrogen\n(NOx) and odd hydrogen (HOx) compounds are created\n[Solomon et al., 1982]. HOx and NOx take part in the catalytic\ndestruction of ozone and hence change the radiative balance\nof the atmosphere [Brasseur and Solomon, 2005]. Although\nHOx is a short\u2010lived species that only acts on ozone in situ,\nNOx is long\u2010lived (with a lifetime of days to months) in the\nabsence of photolysis and can therefore be transported\nhorizontally and vertically during its lifetime. This is par-\nticularly true in the dark polar wintertime and in the presence\nof the polar vortex [Randall et al., 2005;Manney et al., 2005].\nAs such, the products of energetic particle precipitation pro-\ncesses can have a long\u2010lived and distributed effect on the\nchemistry and radiative balance of the atmosphere [Rozanov\net al., 2005; Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2009].\n[3] Energetic proton precipitation occurring during solar\nproton events (SPEs) is a well\u2010known influence on the\natmosphere [Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2004]. During some intense\nsolar storms, solar protons in the energy range of 1 to\n>100 MeV enter the atmosphere in the polar regions, having\nbeen guided by the geomagnetic field [Rodger et al., 2006].\nProton flux measurements made from geostationary satellites\n(i.e., the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\n(GOES)) have been shown to be good proxies for the flux\nand energy spectrum of protons entering the atmosphere\n[Verronen et al., 2005; Clilverd et al., 2005, 2006a]. The\nhighest energy protons can occasionally penetrate as low as\n1British Antarctic Survey, Natural Environment Research Council,\nCambridge, UK.\n2Department of Physics, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\n3Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary,\nCalgary, Canada.\n4School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of\nNewcastle, Callaghan, Australia.\n5Department of Earth and Planetary Physics, University of Tokyo,\nTokyo, Japan.\n6Department of Physics, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JA015204\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, A08323, doi:10.1029\/2009JA015204, 2010\nA08323 1 of 14\nthe ground, although typically the lowest altitude influenced\nis 40\u201350 km [Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2008]. The lower energy protons\nscatter in the atmosphere at much higher altitudes (\u223c120 km\nfor 1 MeV protons), but are still capable of ionizing the\natmospheric constituents [Turunen et al., 2009].\n[4] However, while SPEs are intense, they are relatively\ninfrequent, and typically only last for a few days [Shea and\nSmart, 1990; Richardson et al., 2000]. When they do occur,\nSPEs are more frequent during the 11\u2010year solar cycle\nmaximum than at solar minimum [Borovsky and Denton,\n2006]. In contrast, energetic electron precipitation driven\nby radiation belt processes is less well understood in terms\nof measurements of the flux and location of electrons\nentering the atmosphere. Further, there is considerable\nuncertainty as to the energy spectra of the electron precip-\nitation, since there are multiple radiation belt processes\ntaking place, such as acceleration and loss by several dif-\nferent VLF (very low frequency) wave\u2010particle interaction\nprocesses [Imhof et al., 1992; Blake et al., 1996;Millan et al.,\n2002; Horne, 2002], and radial transport by ULF (ultralow\nfrequency) waves [Fei et al., 2006 and references therein].\nEnergy diffusion due to electron gyroresonance with chorus,\nplasmaspheric hiss, and electromagnetic ion\u2010cyclotron\nwaves (EMIC) have been shown to be key mechanisms for\ngenerating relativistic electrons in the region outside of the\nplasmasphere during geomagnetic storms [e.g., Summers\net al., 2007, and references therein]. Omura et al.\n[2008] describe recent progress in understanding the accel-\neration of energetic electrons in the outer radiation belt caused\nby nonlinear wave\u2010particle interactions by the relativistic\nFigure 1.

A 27 day recurrent period of high solar wind,\ngeomagnetic activity, and high electron fluxes is indicted by the dot\u2010dashed vertical lines.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n2 of 14\nsecond\u2010order resonance condition for whistler\u2010mode waves.\nThe gyroresonant pitch\u2010angle scattering of electrons by\nchorus, plasmaspheric hiss, and EMIC waves can lead to\nsignificant precipitation into the atmosphere and the net loss\nof energetic electrons from the outer radiation belt [e.g.,\nLorentzen et al., 2001; O\u2019Brien et al., 2004; Thorne et al.,\n2005; Rodger et al., 2007; Rodger et al., 2008].\n[5] Recent results have shown that radiation belt accel-\neration processes are more significant during recurrent high\u2010\nspeed solar wind stream (HSSWS) storms than those oc-\ncurring during storms driven by coronal mass ejections\n(CMEs) [Hilmer et al., 2000; Miyoshi and Kataoka, 2005;\nVassiliadis et al., 2007]. Radiation belt electron precipita-\ntion has been shown to be longer lasting during HSSWS\nstorms than during CMEs [Longden et al., 2008]. HSSWS\nstorms occur more frequently during the declining\u2010mini-\nmum phase of the 11\u2010year solar cycle [Borovsky and\nDenton, 2006]. Generally, radiation belt electron precipita-\ntion processes can be thought of as driving electrons into the\natmosphere at the mid\u2010 to polar latitudes, with a peak\noccurrence frequency taking place during the declining\nphase of the 11\u2010year solar cycle. The detailed time vari-\nability, energy spectrum, and flux, however, have proved\ndifficult to measure.\n[6] Satellite measurements of electron precipitation\nproperties have been available for more than a solar cycle (e.\ng., the Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle\nExplorer (SAMPEX) and the Polar Operational Environ-\nmental Satellites (POES)). However, each satellite instru-\nment has some of the following limitations: limitations in\nspatial or energy resolution, low\u2010energy proton contamina-\ntion, an inability to adequately resolve the drift\u2010bounce loss\ncone. These issues result in uncertainties as to the actual loss\nrates of electrons into the atmosphere when measured from\nsatellites. For example, Rodger et al. [2010] analyzed\n10 years of POES data [Evans and Greer, 2004] to provide a\ndescription of energetic electron precipitation with a com-\nprehensive study of enhanced loss fluxes from the radiation\nbelts, but with limited energy spectrum resolution.\n[7] Ground\u2010based measurements of the lower ionosphere\ncan help contextualize satellite measurements of electron\nprecipitation. Obliquely propagating VLF radio waves can\nbe used to monitor the changes in ionization rate caused by\nelectron precipitation over a great circle path between a\ntransmitter and receiver. The Antarctic\u2010Arctic Radiation\u2010\nbelt (Dynamic) Deposition\u2010VLF Atmospheric Research\nKonsortium (AARDDVARK) network [Clilverd et al., 2009]\nmakes use of this property to determine the path\u2010integrated\neffect of electron precipitation in many high\u2010latitude loca-\ntions around the world. The enhancement in ionization rate\nas a result of electron precipitation causes changes in the\nreceived phase and amplitude of the observed signals, which\ncan be readily compared with the non\u2010disturbed, quiet\u2010day\nbehavior.\n[8] In this study, we analyse data from an AARDDVARK\nreceiver located in Churchill, Canada, and concentrate on\nsignals from three U.S. transmitters (with the call signs\nNAA, NDK, NLK). The signals are used to determine the\neffects of electron precipitation into the atmosphere over the\nrange 3 < L < 8, i.e., where outer radiation belt processes\noccur. We study the period of May to November 2007, which\nincludes several recurrent HSSWS solar activity cycles, and\nanalyze the Churchill AARDDVARK data in comparison\nwith POES electron flux observations at >300 keV and\n>1 MeV. The radio\u2010wave propagation effects observed are\nthen described in terms of the effectiveness of recurrent solar\nactivity in producing energetic electron precipitation into the\natmosphere.\n2. Experimental Setup\n[9] Figure 1 shows the geomagnetic conditions during the\nMay to November 2007 period that is studied in this paper.\nThe solar wind speed, daily SKp, daily Dst, and daily\nGOES >2 MeV electron flux are plotted in separate panels\nordered from top to bottom. Each panel also shows a 7 day\nsmoothed line (solid line) for each parameter. The solar\nwind speed during the study period ranged from 250 km\/s to\n700 km\/s. After day 210, a HSSWS feature appeared which\nrepeated four timeswithin a 27 day period. During this period,\nthe solar wind speeds consistently peaked at \u223c650 km\/s,\ndropping to \u223c250 km\/s 10 days after the peak. The SKp and\nDst values followed a very similar pattern to the solar wind\nspeed, with the highest geomagnetic disturbance occurring\non the third recurrence of the HSSWS activity. Very similar\npatterns can be seen in the GOES electron fluxes, where\nhigh solar wind and high geomagnetic activity were asso-\nciated with high electron\u2010flux levels at geostationary orbit.\nThe peak times of the 27 day recurrent activity in solar wind,\ngeomagnetic activity, and high L = 6.6 electron fluxes are\nindicted by the dot\u2010dashed vertical lines in Figure 1. For\nclarity, we have labeled the recurrent storm activity cycles as\ncycles 1\u20134. We note that during the May to November 2007\nperiod studied there were no occasions where elevated solar\nproton flux occurred which could potentially mask the ef-\nfects of energetic electron precipitation into the high\u2010latitude\natmosphere.\n[10] To study the electron precipitation effects into the\natmosphere during the May to November 2007 period, this\npaper uses narrowband, subionospheric, very low frequency\n(VLF) data spanning 24\u201325 kHz that were received at\nChurchill, Canada (located at 58\u00b044\u2032N, 93\u00b049\u2032W; L = 7.6).\nThe Churchill site is part of the AARDDVARK network\n[Clilverd et al., 2009]. (For further information, see the\ndescription of the array provided at http:\/\/www.physics.ota-\ngo.ac.nz\/space\/AARDDVARK_homepage.htm). The trans-\nmitters studied have the call signs NAA (24.0 kHz; located at\n44\u00b039\u2032N, 67\u00b017\u2032W; L = 2.9), NDK (25.2 kHz; located at 46\u00b0\n22\u2032N, 98\u00b020\u2032W; L = 3.2), and NLK (24.8 kHz; located at 48\u00b0\n12\u2032N, 121\u00b055\u2032W; L = 2.9). The effects of changing ionization\nconditions in the mesosphere due to energetic particle pre-\ncipitation can be observed along the propagation path\nbetween a transmitter and a receiver. Subionospheric propa-\ngation is sensitive to ionization located below \u223c90 km alti-\ntude. The effect of increased ionization on the propagating\nsignals can be seen as either an increase or decrease in signal\namplitude or phase, depending on the modal mixture of each\nsignal observed [Barr et al., 2000; Clilverd et al., 2007].\n[11] Figure 2 shows the location of the Churchill radio\nwave receiver site (diamond) and the transmitter\u2010receiver\npaths that are studied during the event period (the NAA,\nNDK, and NLK transmitter locations are shown by the\ncircles). The propagation paths span the range 3 < L < 8,\neffectively integrating the subionospheric electron precipi-\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n3 of 14\ntation along the paths from the whole of the outer radiation\nbelt. The three paths analysed are relatively short, the\ntransmitters are very similar in frequency, and their geo-\nmagnetic latitudes are also very similar. As such, we com-\nbine the data from the three transmitters in order to confirm\nthat large scale precipitation effects are occurring on all\nthree paths at the same time.\n[12] In this study we also make use of particle measure-\nments by the Space Environment Monitor\u20102 (SEM\u20102)\ninstrument package onboard the POES spacecraft which are\nin Sun\u2010synchronous orbits at altitudes of \u223c800\u2013850 km\n[Evans and Greer, 2004]. SEM\u20102 includes the Medium\nEnergy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED), in addition\nto the Total Energy Detector (TED). Together these instru-\nments monitor electron fluxes from 50 eV up to 2700 keV.\nWe make use of SEM\u20102 observations from up to four POES\nspacecraft. All POES data are available from http:\/\/poes.\nngdc.noaa.gov\/data\/; while the full\u2010resolution data have 2 s\ntime resolution, we work with the 16 s resolution ASCII\nfiles. The 0\u00b0\u2010pointing detectors are mounted on the three\u2010\naxis\u2010stabilized POES spacecraft so that the centre of each\ndetector field of view is outward along the local zenith,\nparallel to the Earth\u2010center\u2010to\u2010satellite radial vector.\nAnother set of detectors termed \u201c90\u00b0\u2010minus\u201d are mounted\napproximately perpendicular to the 0\u00b0 detector. In addition,\nthere is also a set of omnidirectional measurements made\nfrom a dome detector which is mounted parallel to the 0\u00b0\ndetectors. The detectors pointing in the 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 directions\nare \u00b115\u00b0 wide, while the omnidirectional dome detectors\n(termed \u201comni\u201d) are \u00b160\u00b0 wide. For the L\u2010shells we con-\nsider, the 90\u00b0\u2010detector appears to primarily respond to\ntrapped electrons, and hence we refer to it as the \u201ctrapped\ndetector\u201d. In Figure 3, we show the >300 keV, 90\u00b0 POES\u2013\ntrapped electron fluxes during the study period of May to\nNovember 2007, indicating the influence of HSSWS on the\nenergetic electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt (Figure 3,\nsolar wind speed shown in upper panel). The black shading\nin Figure 3 indicates a lack of data.\n[13] Ground\u2010based magnetometer data are also analyzed\nin this study, particularly for ULF phenomena in the higher\npart of this frequency band (i.e., up to 5 Hz). Figure 2 shows\nthe locations of the magnetometers at Lucky Lake (labeled\n\u201cLCL\u201d) and Island Lake (labeled \u201cISLL). The Island Lake\nmagnetometer is part of the Canadian Array for Realtime\nInvestigations of Magnetic Activity (CARISMA) network\n[Mann et al., 2008]. The Narod fluxgate magnetometers\nthere provide a data stream sampled at 8 Hz. At Lucky Lake,\na search coil magnetometer operated by the University of\nTokyo provides data sampled at 10 Hz. We determine the\ndaily average ULF intensity, having filtered over the\nbandwidth of interest. During the study period in 2007, we\nused 1\u201322 mHz from the Island Lake magnetometer in the\nPc4\u20135 range, and we used 0.1\u20135 Hz from the Lucky Lake\nmagnetometer in the Pc1\u20132 range.\n3. Results\n3.1. Energetic Electron Precipitation\n[14] When energetic electron precipitation ionizes the\natmosphere it typically changes the propagation conditions\nfor transmitter signals by modifying the upper boundary\ncondition of the subionospheric waveguide. The lower\nboundary, being the land or sea surface, is regarded as\nremaining constant with time. Under non\u2010disturbed iono-\nspheric conditions, the upper boundary conditions of the\nsubionospheric waveguide will vary throughout the day as\nthe Sun rises and sets. Typically we would expect to observe\nhigher amplitude transmitter signals during the night and\nlower amplitudes during the day, with deep minima during\nthe sunrise and sunset periods [e.g., Clilverd et al., 1999].\nFigure 3.

In\neach panel there are three lines representing a non\u2010disturbed,\npre\u2010storm variation (solid line); an initial storm\u2010phase var-\niation (dotted line); and a main storm\u2010phase variation\n(dashed line). The pre\u2010storm data shown are from either 18\nor 21 May 2007. The selection is primarily influenced by the\nneed for the transmitter to be operating the entire day and\nnot undergoing any off\u2010air maintenance. The initial storm\ndata are taken from either 23 or 24 May 2007, and the main\nphase data are taken from 26 May 2007. The storm time\nvariations from all three transmitters follow basically the\nsame pattern, i.e., during a geomagnetic storm, the nighttime\namplitude decreases and the daytime amplitude increases\nrelative to the non\u2010disturbed behavior. This is consistent\nwith increased ionization at altitudes that define the upper\nboundary for subionospheric propagation of \u223c25 kHz radio\nwaves, i.e., altitudes below \u223c85 km during the night and\nbelow \u223c72 km during the day [McRae and Thomson, 2000;\nThomson and Clilverd, 2007]. This suggests an experi-\nmental sensitivity to electron precipitation energies >50 keV\nat night and >200 keV during the day [Turunen et al., 2009].\nFigure 4.

In each panel, there are three lines\nrepresenting a non\u2010disturbed, pre\u2010storm variation (solid line, 18 or 21 May 2007); an initial storm\u2010phase\nvariation (dotted line, 23 or 24 May 2007); and a main storm\u2010phase variation (dashed line, 26 May 2007).\nLocal time for the midpoint of each path is shown at the top of each panel.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n5 of 14\nFigures 5\u20139 show the difference in amplitude between the\ndaytime average and the nighttime average (Amp diff).\nDuring non\u2010disturbed periods, nighttime amplitudes are\nhigher than daytime amplitudes, and thus the difference in\namplitude is negative. During disturbed periods, the differ-\nence in amplitude becomes more positive as the nighttime\namplitudes become lower than the daytime amplitudes. This\nbehavior has been observed previously in connection with\nenhanced ionization events such as solar proton events\n[Clilverd et al., 2006b], has been modelled successfully in\nterms of general ionization enhancements [Clilverd et al.,\n2007], and has been used to study changes of ionization\nfor observation periods of many months [Clilverd et al.,\n2009]. The phases of the transmitter signals also show dis-\ntinct changes as a result of electron precipitation, with the\nmost significant change being observed as a phase advance\nduring the nighttime. However, in this paper we confine\nourselves to discussing amplitude changes, as they are more\nreadily analyzed over the multi\u2010month period analyzed in\nthis paper, and consistent with previous analysis of this type\n[Clilverd et al., 2007].\nFigure 5.

Also plotted in\neach panel is the 7 day smoothed daily sum Kp (solid line),\nscaled to fit the difference in amplitude variations, and the\nvertical dot\u2010dashed lines, as shown in Figure 1, to represent\nthe peaks of the recurrent storm activity cycles 1\u20134. The\nbottom panel in Figure 5 shows the average daytime riometer\nabsorption from Gillam (L = 6.3), located in central Canada.\nThese results should be representative of electron precipi-\ntation from the outer radiation belts in the energy range of 30\u2013\n200 keV [Little and Leinbach, 1959; Browne et al., 1995].\n[17] Figure 5 shows that as the geomagnetic activity\nvaries so does the amplitude difference for each transmitter,\nindicating the presence of varying energetic electron pre-\ncipitation resulting from enhanced geomagnetic activity.\nFollowing the large storm that occurred near the end of May\n2007 (day \u223c147, shown in Figure 4), a period of relatively\nquiet geomagnetic activity occurred until the onset of the\nrecurrent activity starting on day \u223c210. During the four\ncycles of the recurrent activity for which we have data, the\namplitude difference shows a consistent positive response to\nFigure 6.

However, particularly\nfollowing the most intense geomagnetic activity periods\n(cycles 2 and 3, occurring at days \u223c250 and \u223c280), the\namplitude differences remain high for \u223c10\u201315 days after-\nward, despite the fact that geomagnetic activity has subsided\nto lower levels, particularly for Kp. This is true for the\nobservation paths sampled by all three transmitters. The\nlower panel in Figure 5 shows that the riometer response\ndoes not behave in a similar way, peaking in absorption\nbriefly, and apparently responding only during the time of\nthe peak of the geomagnetic activity. This therefore suggests\nthat the energy of the electron precipitation driving the\nelevated VLF radio wave amplitude difference response is\n>200 keV, and thus the energy would not be registered by\nthe riometer.\n3.3. Comparison With Dst\n[18] Although Kp is a well known geomagnetic activity\nindex, we can also compare the amplitude difference var-\niations with another index of geomagnetic disturbance, Dst.\nDst is a measure of the energy density of the ring current\ncalculated from the average value of the horizontal com-\nponent of the geomagnetic field measured at four near\u2010\nequatorial geomagnetic observatories. Typically Dst shows\na negative deviation during geomagnetic storms. Recurrent\nFigure 7. The day\u2010night amplitude difference for NAA, NDK, and NLK, received at Churchill in 2007\n(diamonds joined by dotted line) compared with the 3 < L < 7 averaged POES >300 keV trapped electron\nflux for the same period (solid line). Recurrent solar activity cycles are labeled as cycles 1\u20134.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n8 of 14\ngeomagnetic storms typically show Dst values of \u223c\u221250 nT\n[Borovsky and Denton, 2006]. In Figure 6, we show the\namplitude difference data for each of the three transmitters\nand the riometer absorption from Gillam in the same format\nas Figure 5. However, for Figure 6 we include the smoothed\ndaily Dst variation, scaled to fit the amplitude data. In order\nto do this we invert the Dst scale. The figure shows that Dst\ncan be a good indicator of the recurrent storm effects on the\namplitude difference data. By comparison with Figure 5, it\nis clear that the Dst index captures the onset of the storm\neffect more accurately than Kp. This is particularly notice-\nable for the storm in May 2007 (day \u223c147), and recurrent\nstorm cycle 3. Dst is also more accurate in representing the\ndecline in the recurrent storm effect than Kp, although the\nNAA transmitter in particular still shows some elevated\namplitude difference values after Dst has returned to non-\nstorm levels.\n[19] The lower panel in Figure 6 shows that the riometer\nresponse does not match the variation in Dst particularly\nclosely. In much the same way as with Kp, the riometer\nabsorption only shows any significant response at the\napproximate times of the peaks in Dst activity.\n3.4. Comparison With Satellite Data\n[20] Since the VLF radio waves from NAA, NDK, and\nNLK propagate beneath the region of the subionospheric\nwaveguide that is influenced by electron precipitation from\nthe outer radiation belt, we compare the amplitude differ-\nence variations with the average 3 < L < 7 electron flux\nvariations observed from POES. Figure 7 shows the\namplitude difference for each transmitter (diamonds joined\nby dotted line) and the 3 < L < 7 average POES 90\u00b0\n>300 keV trapped fluxes (solid line). As in previous figures\nthe recurrent cycles in geomagnetic activity are labeled cycles\nby 1\u20134, with the timing of the peak taken from Figure 1 and\nindicated by vertical dot\u2010dashed lines. From Figure 7 we can\nsee that the behavior of the amplitude difference from each\ntransmitter is well represented by the variations in the\n>300 keV fluxes. This is particularly true for cycles 1 and 2,\nbut not for the latter half of cycle 3 where there are enhanced\namplitude differences even after the >300 keV electron\nFigure 8. The remnant amplitude difference values (diamonds) during the study period, each panel\nrepresents one of the three transmitters. Also plotted is the POES \u223c1MeV trapped flux from the omni detec-\ntor (solid line) averaged from 3 < L < 7. Recurrent solar activity cycles are labeled as cycles 1\u20134.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n9 of 14\nfluxes have returned to near\u2010zero levels, particularly around\nday 285. As this is not observed in the riometer data (shown\nin Figures 5 and 6) or the >300 keV fluxes, we investigate the\npossibility that there is even more energetic electron pre-\ncipitation happening during this period at energies signifi-\ncantly beyond 300 keV, i.e., at around 1 MeV, which is not\ncorrelated with lower energy >300 keV precipitation.\n[21] As there is a large component of the difference am-\nplitudes that is well described by the >300 keV fluxes, we\ncan remove that effect by scaling the fluxes as shown in\nFigure 7 and then subtracting them from the difference va-\nlues. The result is shown in Figure 8, where the diamonds\nrepresent the remnant amplitude difference values during the\nstudy period, and each panel shows one of the three trans-\nmitters. Once again, we look for consistency between the\nthree transmitter data sets to confirm that we are not just\nseeing noise. In each panel we also plot the POES \u223c1 MeV\nonmi detector trapped flux (solid line), averaged from 3 <\nL < 7. The 1 MeV electron fluxes are measured as a con-\ntaminant of the 16 MeV proton dome onmi detector, but as\nthere were no solar proton events during our study period, we\ncan be confident that the fluxes are primarily due to trapped\nenergetic electrons [Rodger et al., 2010]. Figure 8 shows that\nthe remnant amplitude differences vary in a similar way to the\n\u223c1 MeV electron fluxes for all three transmitters, particularly\nduring the \u223c10 to 15 days after recurrent activity cycle 3. Thus\nFigure 9. (top) Comparison of the NAA day\u2010night amplitude difference (dotted line, open diamonds)\nwith the result of combining the equivalent POES >300 keV trapped electron flux determined from\nFigure 7 and the equivalent \u223c1 MeV trapped electron flux determined from Figure 8 (solid line, solid\ndiamonds). (middle) The equivalent smoothed daily sum Kp (solid line) and the >300 keV fluxes (dotted\nline), shifted earlier by 4 days, and the \u223c1 MeV fluxes (solid line, diamonds), shifted earlier by 12 days.\n(bottom) The equivalent smoothed daily Dst (solid line) and the >300 keV fluxes (dotted line), shifted\nearlier by 0 days, and the \u223c1 MeV fluxes (solid line, diamonds), shifted earlier by 9 days.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n10 of 14\nit appears most likely that the long\u2010lived VLF amplitude\ndisturbance seen in our observations is due to a combination\nof >300 keV and relativistic (\u223c1 MeV) electron precipitation,\nwith a spectrum that hardens with time such that there is an\nincreasing fraction of relativistic electrons.\n[22] Following the approach of Rodger et al. [2010, see\nFigure 8], who saw energy dependant time delays ranging\nfrom 1 to 12 days in the POES energetic electron data after\nrecurrent storms, we consider the possibility that the\nenhanced difference amplitudes observed on all three\ntransmitters after cycle 3 could be due to a delayed\nenhancement of high\u2010energy electron fluxes relative to\nlower\u2010energy electrons. In Figure 9 (upper panel) we plot\nthe day\u2010night amplitude difference for the NAA transmitter\n(dotted line, open diamonds) and compare them with the\nresults of adding together the equivalent amplitude effect of\nthe POES >300 keV trapped electron flux determined from\nFigure 7 and the \u223c1 MeV trapped electron flux determined\nfrom Figure 8 (solid line, solid diamonds). The combination\nof the equivalent amplitude effect of the two energy ranges\nprovides a reasonable description of the amplitude differ-\nence data in the upper panel of Figure 9. The middle panel\nof Figure 9 shows the smoothed daily sum Kp (solid line),\nwith the >300 keV fluxes shifted earlier by 4 days and the\n\u223c1 MeV fluxes shifted earlier by 12 days. The smoothed\ndaily sum Kp (solid line) is not shifted in time at all. A very\nclear phasing of several recurrent activity cycles can be\nseen, suggesting that there is an increased delay for\nincreasing electron energies, which is the same as the results\nof Rodger et al. [2010], who attributed this delay to the\neffects of wave\u2010particle interaction processes taking place in\nthe outer radiation belt following recurrent geomagnetic\nactivity. The lower panel of Figure 9 shows the smoothed\ndaily Dst (solid line), with the >300 keV fluxes shifted\nearlier by 0 days and the \u223c1 MeV fluxes shifted earlier by\n9 days. This panel suggests that Dst is a good representation\nof the amplitude difference effects on NAA, as represented\nby the POES >300 keV trapped electron flux, that requires 0\ndays offset. But a 9 day offset to the \u223c1 MeV fluxes is\nrequired to capture the full amplitude difference variation\nrepresented by the combination of >300 keV fluxes and\n\u223c1 MeV fluxes.\n3.5. Comparison With ULF Power Variations\n[23] Mathie and Mann [2000] demonstrated that MeV\nelectron\u2010flux enhancements at geostationary orbit (L = 6.6)\nfollowed days of elevated Pc5 ULF wave power in the outer\nmagnetosphere, suggesting that Pc5 pulsations were\ninvolved in the acceleration of electrons to MeV energies.\nAn association between solar wind speed and Pc5 ULF\nwave power was shown for the first half of 1995, particu-\nlarly associations involving recurrent fast solar wind speed\nstreams. In this study, Figure 1 shows that our study period\ninvolves recurrent high speed solar wind streams that have\nassociated enhancements in geostationary MeV electron\nfluxes, suggesting the presence of enhanced ULF wave\npower. Furthermore, Rodger et al. [2008] showed that the\nprecipitation of \u223c1 MeV electrons into the atmosphere at L =\n\u223c4\u20135 was associated with electromagnetic ion\u2010cyclotron\nwaves (EMIC) observed in the ULF Pc1\u20132 range during\nperiods of moderate geomagnetic activity. Summers and\nThorne [2003] examined the mechanism of electron pitch\u2010\nangle diffusion by gyroresonant interaction with EMIC\nwaves as a cause of relativistic electron precipitation loss\nfrom the outer radiation belt. They concluded that electrons\nwith energy \u22641 MeV can be removed from the outer radi-\nation belt by EMIC wave scattering during a magnetic storm\nover a time scale of several hours to a day. Therefore we\ninvestigate the variation of Pc4\u20135 and Pc1\u20132 wave power\nobserved at magnetometer sites located in Canada in the\nL\u2010shell range between those of the VLF transmitters and the\nChurchill receiver. The time variations of the Pc4\u20135 and\nPc1\u20132 wave power may allow us to infer some causative\nlinkage to the delayed electron precipitation effects that are\nshown by the VLF radio wave data in Figure 5.\n[24] Figure 10 shows the daily average ULF intensity in\nthe Pc4\u20135 range (1\u201322 mHz) from the Island Lake fluxgate\nmagnetometer (ISLL, L = 5.2), and ULF intensity in the\nPc1\u20132 range (0.1\u20135 Hz) from the Lucky Lake search coil\nmagnetometer (LCL, L = 3.9, 10 Hz) during the study\nperiod in 2007. In the plot, the y\u2010axis units for ISLL and\nLCL are arbitrary and different and cannot be compared.\nThese magnetometer sites are marked as squares in Figure 2.\nAlso shown in Figure 10 are the daily SKp and daily Dst\nvariations and vertical lines to indicate the peak of the\nrecurrent solar wind cycles. The variation of the Pc4\u20135 wave\nintensity (a proxy for power) was closely associated with the\nvariation of SKp, which we show in Figure 1 to be phase\u2010\nlocked to the solar wind speed. These observations of Pc4\u20135\nwave intensity are consistent with the results of Mathie and\nMann [2000]. The Pc4\u20135 intensity was not enhanced during\ndays 280\u2013285, when the VLF signals suggest the occurrence\nof electron precipitation. The variation of the Pc1\u20132 wave\nintensity is not as clearly associated with the SKp variation,\nbut does show enhanced levels during days 280\u2013285 that are\nconsistent with the subionospheric VLF data.\n[25] The interpretation of Figure 10 suggests that while\nPc4\u20135 wave power is enhanced at the same time as the solar\nwind speed and SKp it does not appear to play any role in\nthe delayed electron precipitation that is observed with the\nVLF data. The association of high Pc4\u20135 wave power with\nhigh levels of geostationary MeV electron fluxes is consis-\ntent with the conclusion of Mathie and Mann [2000] in\nterms of the ULF waves accelerating electrons to high\nenergy in the magnetosphere. Conversely, the period of\nenhanced Pc1\u20132 wave intensity is consistent with the elec-\ntron precipitation observed with the VLF data. This suggests\nthat Pc1\u20132 wave power is involved in the electron loss\nprocesses from the magnetosphere, dumping electrons into\nthe atmosphere. The location of the Lucky Lake magne-\ntometer site, from which the Pc1\u20132 wave power was\ndetermined, is close to the outer edge of the plasmasphere (L\n= \u223c4), and so the electron precipitation may be associated\nwith EMIC waves located near the plasmapause [Fraser and\nNguyen, 2001]. Further work is required to accurately locate\nthe region of electron precipitation and model the VLF\nresponse to it. Although the energy of electron precipitation\nthat has been associated with EMIC waves is \u223c1 MeV\n[Rodger et al., 2008], and we have shown in this study that\nenhanced fluxes of \u223c1MeV electrons are also observed by the\nPOES satellites, it is as yet unclear why the loss process takes\nplace with such a delay compared with the geomagnetic storm\nand the associated electron acceleration processes.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n11 of 14\n4. Discussion and Summary\n[26] In 2007, we operated a radio receiver at Churchill,\nCanada from May to November. During that period, the\nphase and amplitude from three U.S. \u223c25 kHz transmitters\nwere recorded (call signs NAA, NDK, and NLK). Geo-\nmagnetic activity during the study period was generally low,\nas would be expected for the minimum of the 11 year solar\nactivity cycle. However, there were four cycles of recurrent\ngeomagnetic activity spaced \u223c27 days apart that were gen-\nerated by a corotating interaction region, with daily SKp\nreaching \u223c30 at the peaks of the disturbances and daily Dst\nreaching \u223c\u221230 nT. The difference in the amplitude of the\ntransmitters between daytime and nighttime varied with\ngeomagnetic activity and was used as a proxy for sub-\nionospheric ionization changes caused by energetic electron\nprecipitation during the geomagnetic storms. We used the\nday\u2010night amplitude differences to investigate the variation\nof electron precipitation from the outer radiation belt during\nthe recurrent geomagnetic storms.\n[27] For the most intense of the recurrent geomagnetic\nstorms, there was evidence of electron precipitation between\nL = 3 and L = 7 for 10\u201315 days after the peak of the dis-\nturbance, as measured by sum Kp and daily Dst. The lesser\ndisturbances showed precipitation effects that lasted for 5\u2013\n10 days after the peak disturbance. This was found to be\nconsistent with the time variation of the fluxes of >300 keV\nand \u223c1 MeV trapped electrons measured by POES. Using\nequivalent amplitude effects of the POES >300 keV and\n\u223c1 MeV trapped electron fluxes, it was possible to explain\nFigure 10. Daily average ULF Pc4\u20135 and Pc1\u20132 power received at Island Lake (ISLL, L = 5.2) and\nLucky Lake (LCL, L = 3.9) compared with the variation of geomagnetic activity (\u2211Kp) and daily Dst.\nPeriods of recurrent geomagnetic activity are indicated by the vertical dashed lines.\nCLILVERD ET AL.: EEP DURING RECURRENT STORMS A08323A08323\n12 of 14\nthe majority of the time variation in the difference ampli-\ntudes from all three transmitters during the recurrent storm\nactivity. This suggests that the POES\u2013trapped fluxes in this\nenergy range can be used as a reasonable proxy for the\nelectron precipitation fluxes in the bounce loss cone, which\nare much harder to measure and subject to more influence of\nproton contamination [Rodger et al., 2010]. However, we\nshould note that this conclusion has only been shown to\nhold for recurrent storm activity, and on a daily average\nbasis. Other geomagnetic activity influences, and in particular\nshorter time scales, may not show such a relationship.\nFurther analysis of radio wave data from Churchill is\nplanned to address this issue.\n[28] In combining the POES >300 keV and \u223c1 MeV\ntrapped electron fluxes to reproduce the day\u2010night amplitude\ndifference variations observed, we determined that the\nrecurrent storm activity acted on the different energies with\ndifferent delay times. Relative to the smoothed daily SKp,\nthe >300 keV electron fluxes peaked after a delay of 4 days,\nwhile the \u223c1 MeV electron fluxes peaked after a delay of\n12 days. This is consistent with the findings of Rodger et al.\n[2010], who found this type of increasingly delayed\nresponse with increasing electron energy in several periods\nof recurrent storm activity during the declining phase of solar\ncycle 23, typically averaging 2 days delay for >300 keV and\n8 days delay for \u223c1 MeV electrons.\n[29] Relative to the smoothed daily Dst, the POES >300 keV\nelectron fluxes peaked after a delay of 0 days, while the POES\n\u223c1 MeV electron fluxes peaked after a delay of 9 days,\nshowing Dst to be a good measure of the effect of >300 keV\nelectron fluxes.\n[30] The daily average ULF intensity over the Pc4\u20135\nrange from Island Lake (ISLL, L = 5.2) and ULF intensity\nover the Pc1\u20132 range from Lucky Lake (LCL, L = 3.9), both\nsituated between the VLF transmitters and the Churchill\nreceiver, show variations during the study period. The ULF\nPc4\u20135 wave intensity was not elevated during the period in\nwhich \u223c1 MeV electron precipitation was identified, but\nvaried in phase with the solar wind speed as with previous\nfindings. The ULF Pc1\u20132 wave intensity was elevated\nduring the \u223c1 MeV electron precipitation period following\nthe third and most intense of the recurrent geomagnetic\nactivity cycles, and is consistent with a picture that involves\nPc1\u20132 waves in radiation belt loss processes. The presence\nof time delays for higher energy electrons is consistent with\na \u201ccartoon\u201d view of electron acceleration processes, for\nexample through cyclotron interactions with whistler\u2010mode\nwaves, such that electrons are accelerated to progressively\nhigher energies over time [Horne et al., 2005]. The pre-\ncipitation of \u223c1 MeV electrons into the atmosphere appears\nto be more associated with the delayed appearance of a loss\nmechanism involving Pc1\u20132 waves (i.e., EMIC waves) than\nas a direct consequence of an ever present loss mechanism\nthat is purely responding to the increase in high\u2010energy\nfluxes through electron acceleration. Clearly, both electron\nacceleration and loss processes need to be active in order to\ngenerate significant levels of energetic electron precipitation\ninto the atmosphere, and further investigation beyond this\nevent study are required to understand the detailed balance\nbetween these processes.\n[31] The importance of energetic electron precipitation\ninto the atmosphere has been demonstrated by many authors\n[e.g., Rozanov et al., 2005; Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 et al., 2009]. A key\nmechanism is the production of chemicals at high latitudes\nduring the polar winter, which can catalytically destroy\nozone and hence change the radiative balance of the atmo-\nsphere [Brasseur and Solomon, 2005]. In global climate\nmodels energetic electron precipitation must either be re-\npresented by measurements from the ground or spacecraft,\nor by a proxy such as Kp or Ap. In this study, we have\nshown that for one type of geomagnetic activity (recurrent\nHSSWS) the >300 keV trapped electron flux from POES is\na reasonable measurement to use, although it does not\ncapture all of the variability of the electron precipitation\nfrom the outer radiation belt. We have also shown that it\nmay be possible to describe energetic electron precipitation\nusing a proxy such as Kp or Dst, but we note that careful\nincorporation of time delays for different electron energies\nmust be considered, particularly for Kp. Further work is\nneeded to determine the energetic electron precipitation\nfluxes and spectra that are suggested by the >300 keV\ntrapped fluxes.\n[32] Acknowledgments.
