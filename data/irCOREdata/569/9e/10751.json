The continuing political potency of  her thesis requires that it should\nbe defended and strengthened. \nI\nt is difficult to overestimate the enduring influence of  the\nemotional labour thesis found in Arlie Russell Hochschild\u2019s\nseminal work, The Managed Heart: Commercialization of  Human\nFeeling (2003 [1983]). Debates on emotional labour continue to turn\non this pioneering contribution (Bolton, 2005), and yet it is an\nunlikely candidate to have won such a high profile. Published in the\nThe Alienated Heart:\nHochschild\u2019s \u2018emotional\nlabour\u2019 thesis and the\nanticapitalist politics of\nalienation \nPaul Brook \nAbstract\nIntroduction: A very political theoryharsh, neoconservative climate of  Reagan\u2019s USA, the book\nresolutely exposes and opposes the harm wrought by the expanding\ndemand for the commodification of  emotions in the form of\ncustomer service. Thus, The Managed Heart\u2019s core arguments and\npolitical conclusions are highly relevant to today\u2019s anticapitalist\nmovement with its slogan of  \u2018our world is not for sale\u2019,\nunderpinned by its damning analyses of  neoliberalism, corporate\npower and consumerism.\nSince The Managed Heart, Hochschild\u2019s emotional labour thesis\nhas spawned an immense range of  studies that reach far into the\nworld of  work beyond her original study of  flight attendants and\ndebt collectors. These, which Bolton (2005:  53) has referred to\npejoratively as an \u2018emotional labour bandwagon\u2019, include studies of\nnurses, Disneyland workers, retail and childcare workers,\nschoolteachers, psychotherapists, holiday representatives, call-\ncentre workers, bar staff, waiters and many others (see Steinberg &\nFigart, 1999; Bolton, 2005). While these studies vary in the degree to\nwhich they follow Hochschild in her explicit condemnation of\nemotional labour, they tend to contain an implicit acceptance of  its\nexploitative and subordinating nature. Some have extended\nHochschild\u2019s thesis to include additional dimensions, as in Witz et\nal.\u2019s (2003) addition of  aesthetic labour, which stresses the increasing\ncommodification of  service workers\u2019 appearance and sexuality as\n\u2018display\u2019. Most notable has been the development of  a feminist\ndimension to emotional labour debates, which centres on the\nsocially reproduced, gendered commodification of  emotion in\norganisations, and on the related feminisation of  most service work\n(see Fineman, 2005; Colley, 2006; Lewis & Simpson, 2007). Thus\nJames (1989,  1992), in her pioneering studies of  cancer nurses\u2019\nemotional labour, developed a feminist orientation in her analysis\nof  the source, maintenance and commodification of  compassion in\nthe \u2018caring workplace\u2019.\n1\nWhat underpins Hochschild\u2019s politicised critique in The\nManaged Heart\n2 is the pivotal role played in it by her application of\nMarx\u2019s alienation theory. This is borne out by the central argument\nof  some of  Hochschild\u2019s critics, who seek to blunt her critique by\nrejecting as absolutist her condemnation of  the alienation workers\nsuffer through the commodification of  their emotions. They argue\ninstead that customer service interactions are double-edged in that\nthey possess the potential to be subjectively satisfying as well as\ndistressing for the worker (Wouters, 1989; Tolich, 1993; Korczynski,\n2002). In essence, they reject the notion that the experience of\nhaving one\u2019s emotions commodified is intrinsically alienating.\nIndeed, in recent years there has been a growing movement\n8\nCapital & Class 989\ntowards the rejection of  \u2018emotional labour\u2019 as a meaningful\ncategory of  wage labour (see Bolton & Boyd, 2003; Bolton, 2005;\nLewis & Simpson, 2007), on the basis that not all emotions are\ncommodified in the labour process, and that Hochschild\u2019s\napplication of  alienation in this context implies that workers are\nrendered powerless. Consequently, Hochschild\u2019s \u2018emotional labour\u2019\ntheory is now challenged by a growing usage of  Bolton\u2019s (2005)\nalternative, largely depoliticised thesis on \u2018emotion management\u2019 in\norganisations. This argues that emotion workers exercise a\nsignificant degree of  emotional free choice because of  the very\nlimited extent to which their emotions can be commodified.\nTherefore, they enjoy a largely unalienated experience of  the\nlabour process. To date it has been Hochschild\u2019s opponents, rather\nthan those who wish to build on her thesis, who have recognised her\nunderstanding and use of  alienation as pivotal, and who have\nthereby subjected it to sustained criticism (e.g. Wouters, 1989;\nTolich, 1993; Bolton, 2005).\nAlthough it has been condemned as absolutist, Hochschild\u2019s\napplication of  alienation theory is nevertheless not thorough.\n3 She\nrestricts her explicit theorisation to the two of  Marx\u2019s (1975 [1844])\nfour dimensions that are specific to the workplace: product\nalienation and labour process alienation. The first deals with\nworkers\u2019 loss of  control over and ownership of  their labour\nproduct, and the second with the removal of  their control over the\nlabour process. However, while alienation has its source at the point\nof  production, Marx\u2019s remaining two dimensions relate to the\nwider corrosive effects of  alienation in society, and should not be\nseparated from the first two (Yuill, 2005). These dimensions \u2013\nhuman nature alienation and fellow beings alienation (including\ncommodity fetishism) \u2013 deal with the way the suffusion of  the\ncommodity form and market relations through society severely\ndistort our self-knowledge, social relations and understanding of\nthe world. While these dimensions are occasionally implicit in\nHochschild\u2019s analysis, she does not explore them as wider social\ndimensions of  alienation contributing to and compounding the\ndirect commodification of  workplace emotions. In not doing so,\nshe stops short of  theorising alienation as generic to capitalist\nsociety (Meszaros, 2005 [1970]; Billig, 1999). This effectively\nlocalises the existence of  alienation to workplace social relations.\nFurthermore,  The Managed Heart is devoid of  an explicit class\nanalysis. This undermines Hochschild\u2019s argument in explaining\nindividual and collective responses, including resistance by\nemotional labourers. She compounds this weakness with an\ninsufficiently dialectical analysis (Rees, 1998) whereby she is unable\nThe Alienated Heartto capture the complexity and potential of  contradictory\ndimensions in the emotional labour process (Sturdy, 1998; Taylor,\n1998). Thus Hochschild inadequately theorises the way workers are\nshaped by alienation but not blinded to the reality of  capitalism\n(Luk\u00e1cs, 1974; Heller, 1978). \nThe combination of  under-theorisation and theoretical gaps\ngenerates weaknesses in her overall thesis that leave it open to more\nvalid criticisms than partisan claims of  absolutism. In particular,\nHochschild is criticised for her tendency to dichotomise the\ndistinction between the private self  and the commodified public self\n(Wouters, 1989; Barbalet, 2001; Bolton, 2005); and for overestimating\nthe degree of  managerial ownership and control of  workers\u2019\nemotions (Ashworth & Humphreys, 1993; Barbalet, 2001; Bolton, 2005;\nTheodosius, 2006), as a consequence of  which she presents frontline\nworkers as \u2018crippled actors\u2019 (Bolton & Boyd, 2003). \nWhatever the weaknesses in Hochschild\u2019s thesis, it is neverthless\n\u2018one that clearly politicises our understanding of  emotion at work\u2019\n(Fineman, 2005: 6). What follows is a critical defence of  Hochschild\u2019s\nemotional labour thesis at a time when there are growing efforts to\nreject its Marxian core of  alienation theory, and to diminish its\npolitical content. Accordingly, this article aims to defend the thesis as\na valuable contribution and a significant building block for a still thin\nMarxist debate on emotional labour.\n4 It begins with an exposition of\nHochschild\u2019s thesis, followed by an analysis of  the \u2018emotional labour\u2019\nconcept against each of  Marx\u2019s four dimensions of  alienation.\nCentral to this assessment is the question of  the adequacy of  her\ntheorisation of  worker\u2019s resistance arising from the alienation of\nemotional labour, and how it can be strengthened and developed\nwithin the classical Marxist tradition (see Rees, 1998). \nThe Managed Heart\u2019s opening lines set the analytic and political tone\nfor what is to come. Hochschild begins by citing the case of  the\nyoung boy in a wallpaper factory discussed by Marx in Capital. She\nnotes Marx\u2019s point that the boy is no more than an instrument of\nlabour, and expresses a fundamental concern at the human cost.\nHochschild then makes a direct comparison between the boy in the\nnineteenth-century wallpaper factory and a flight attendant over a\ncentury later:\nThe work done by the boy in the wallpaper factory called for\na co-ordination of  mind and arm, mind and finger, and mind\nand shoulder. We refer to it simply as physical labor. The\n10\nCapital & Class 98\nEmotional labour in play11\nflight attendant does physical labor when she pushes heavy\nmeal carts through the aisles, and she does mental work when\nshe prepares for and actually organizes emergency landings\nand evacuations. But in the course of  doing this physical and\nmental labor she is doing something more, something I define\nas \u2018emotional labor\u2019. This labor requires one to induce or sup-\npress feelings in order to sustain the outward countenance\nthat produces the proper state of  mind in others. (p. 7)\nHere Hochschild is laying the foundations for her argument that\nthe human cost of  performing emotional labour is as harmful as\nthat of  the physical and mental labour discussed by Marx. This is\nbecause \u2018beneath the difference between physical and emotional\nlabor there lies a similarity in the possible cost of  doing the work:\nthe worker can become estranged or alienated from an aspect of\nself  \u2013 either the body or the margins of  the soul \u2013 that is \u201cused\u201d to\ndo the work\u2019 (p. 7).\nThe early introduction of  alienation theory is joined by another\nequally fundamental use of  Marx\u2019s critique of  wage labour;\nnamely, the distinction between exchange value and use value in the\ncommodification of  emotions. This is integral to Hochschild\u2019s\nprimary definition of  emotional labour as \u2018the management of\nfeeling to create a publicly observable facial and bodily display;\nemotional labor is sold for a wage and therefore has \u201cexchange\nvalue\u201d. I use the synonymous terms \u201cemotion work\u201d or \u201cemotion\nmanagement\u201d to refer to those same acts done in a private context\nwhere they have \u201cuse value\u201d (p. 7).\n5\nHochschild\u2019s analysis rests on this distinction between emotion\nwork and emotional labour. Emotion work is the process of\nmanaging and presenting emotions in the private sphere of  our\nlives, such as amongst family and friends and even as a customer.\nEmotional labour, in contrast, involves the commercialisation of\nworkers\u2019 feelings through a transmutation\n6 of  \u2018private sphere\u2019\nfeelings into a package of  emotions that is consumed by the\ncustomer as a commodified service interaction. The process has the\neffect of  alienating frontline workers from their emotional product\nthrough management\u2019s wresting of  formal ownership and control\nfrom workers of  the form, timing, giving and withdrawal of\nfeelings, moods and their display. \nTwo other aspects compound this loss of  control. First, there is\nan unequal relationship with the customer: \u2018the customer is always\nright\u2019. This is in contrast to our private lives, where we tend to\nexperience a much greater level of  assumed and\/or near equality\nin our emotional interactions:\nThe Alienated HeartIn private life, we are free to question the going rate of\nexchange and free to negotiate a new one. If  we are not satis-\nfied, we can leave; many friendships and marriages die of\ninequality. But in the public world of  work, it is often part of\nan individual\u2019s job to accept uneven exchanges, to be treated\nwith disrespect or anger by a client, all the while closeting into\nfantasy the anger one would like to respond with. Where the\ncustomer is king, unequal exchanges are normal. (pp. 85\u20136)\nSecond, management imposes codified feeling rules on emotional\nlabourers in order to ensure the delivery of  the requisite quality of\ncustomer service. These rules dictate the form, content and\nappropriateness of  emotional displays, thereby separating workers\nfrom the design and control of  the labour process. Workers,\ntherefore, are estranged from their emotional product and the\nprocess of  emotion production. \nHochschild argues that employers\u2019 feeling rules increasingly go\nfurther than demanding behavioural compliance, which she calls\nsurface acting. This is because management frequently strives for\nemotional workers to internalise the feelings they are required to\ndisplay, not only in order to enhance the \u2018quality\u2019 of  the emotional\ndisplay, but also to diminish the likelihood of  emotive dissonance\n(Jansz & Timmers, 2002) caused by the strain of  continuously\nbridging what is really felt with what has to be feigned over long\nperiods. Hochschild argues that the response of  many emotional\nlabourers is to \u2018try to pull the two closer together either by\nchanging what we feel or by changing what we feign\u2019 (p. 90), which\nshe calls deep acting.\nDeep acting is the result of  a worker\u2019s seeking a more\ncomfortable space for her self, free from the dangers of  emotive\ndissonance (Jansz & Timmers, 2002) through the fusion of  her real\nand acted emotional labour. However, despite fusion\u2019s apparent\nbenefits, there is \u2018a cost to be paid\u2019 (p.119), since it is a condition that\nrequires a systemic suppression of  the real self, thereby deepening\nthe individual\u2019s subordination to her commodification. However, as\na contradictory and unstable condition, it can transform into a\nnascent form of  resistance: \nOften the test comes when a company speed-up makes per-\nsonal service impossible to deliver because the individual\u2019s\npersonal self  is too thinly parcelled out to meet the demands\nmade on it. At this point, it becomes harder and harder to\nkeep the public and private selves fused... The worker won-\nders whether her smile and the emotional labor that keeps it\n12\nCapital & Class 9813\nsincere are really hers. Do they really express a part of  her?\nOr are they deliberately worked up and delivered on behalf\nof  the company? (p.133)\nUnderlying Hochschild\u2019s conceptualisation of  emotional labour is\nher \u2018social theory of  emotions\u2019. Such a theory, she argues, has to\npossess both social and psychological dimensions in that it needs to\nbe able to ask how the construction of  social interaction for profit\ninfluences an individual\u2019s personality. Hence, while employers\u2019\nfeeling \u2018rules run deep \u2026 so does the self  that struggles with and\nagainst them\u2019 (p. 229). \nHochschild states that to manage feeling is to consciously strive\nto alter a pre-existing emotional state that is indicative of  a given\nself. Yet this notion of  a psychological given self  does little to\narticulate its relationship with the socially constructed dimension\nof  emotion. For this, Hochschild turns to Freud\u2019s notion of  the\nsignal function of  emotion, whereby messages such as anxiety,\ndelight, hope and despair signal to the individual that there is the\npresence of  danger, pleasure and so forth from within or external\nto the individual. Signal function achieves the integration of  the\nsocial and the psychological dimensions by being a manifestation of\nthe innate self  that is profoundly contingent upon socially\nconstructed prior expectations:\nThe idea of  prior expectation implies the existence of  a prior\nself  that does the expecting \u2026 Most of  us maintain a prior\nexpectation of  a continuous self, but the character of  the self\nwe expect to maintain is subject to profoundly social influ-\nence. Insofar as the self  and all we expect is social \u2026 the way\nemotion signals messages to us is also influenced by social\nfactors. (pp. 231\u20132)\nHochschild\u2019s theory of  emotion, therefore, binds together the\npsychological and the social into an interdependent and dynamic\nunity that is akin to Marx\u2019s ontology of  the dialectical unity of  the\nmind and body (Marx, 1975 [1844]; Meszaros, 2005 [1970]). It does\nthis by integrating the notions of  emotion as a signal function \u2013 a\nbiological sensory function \u2013 with socially constructed prior\nexpectations as indicative of  the given self. Without such a\nconceptualisation, it would be incoherent to theorise alienated\nemotional labour, for without a theory of  human nature, how is it\npossible to identify an alien condition that violates the individual? \nThe Alienated Heart\nAlienated from what?Hochschild\u2019s given self, like Marx\u2019s theory of  \u2018human nature\u2019,\nappears to oppose the common-sense idea that each individual\npossesses a common, discrete and fixed human nature independent\nof  society (Ollman, 1976 [1971]). While Hochschild does not provide\nan explicit anthropology of  the given self, her implied\nconceptualisation is not incompatible with Marx\u2019s materialist\nconception, which argues that the only nature-imposed condition\nof  all human existence is the requirement to labour on the\nenvironment in order to satisfy human needs. As sentient beings,\nhumans are different from other animals \u2013 we are reflective and\nimaginative in the abstract before concretely acting on our natural\nenvironment (Marx, 1976 [1867]). Marx calls our capacity for\nconscious labour species being. This is not just a theory of  individual\nhuman nature: species being is inherently social because in order to\nsurvive, individuals have to enter into collaborative,\ninterdependent relationships.\nFor Marx, the source of  alienation in capitalist society is the\nnecessity for the overwhelming majority of  people to labour for a\nwage in order to ensure physical survival and a semblance of\nemotional dignity, where a minority, the ruling class, owns and\ncontrols the means of  production. A worker, therefore, hands over\nownership and effective control of  her labour \u2013 in other words, her\nspecies being. For Marx, this essential relationship between worker\nand capital generates alienation in capitalist society:\nThe fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e. it does not\nbelong to his essential being; that he therefore does not con-\nfirm himself  in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable\nand not happy, does not develop free physical and mental\nenergy but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind. Hence, the\nworker only feels himself  when he is not working \u2026 (Marx,\n1975: 326)\nHere, Marx explicitly refers to the ruination of  body and mind.\nThis understanding of  mind and body as an interrelated dialectical\nunity (Yuill, 2005) is crucial to the task of  interpreting the efficacy\nof  Hochschild\u2019s argument that emotional labour is alienating in the\nsame way as the production of  physical commodities. \nMarx (1975), as indicated above, identified four dimensions of\nalienation, with the first two \u2013 product alienation and labour\n14\nCapital & Class 98\nHochschild\u2019s half-made theory of alienation 15\nprocess alienation \u2013 dealing with the immediate conditions of\nworkplace relations. The second two, fellow beings alienation and\nhuman nature alienation, encompass capitalist society as a whole.\nThese dimensions are not separate processes with discrete sets of\nsymptoms, but are rather aspects of  a generic process that is\nendemic to capitalism. This is because the whole of  humankind is\nalienated, in that it suffers a loss of  control because the power of\ncapital is embodied as an alien force that confronts individuals and\nsociety as a hostile and potentially destructive power (Meszaros,\n2005 [1970]). How thorough and adequate, then, is Hochschild\u2019s\napplication of  alienation theory, and what are its consequences for\nher theorisation of  emotional labour? \nProduct alienation\nThe worker is alienated from the product of  her labour by the\nsimple fact that it is not she who owns or controls its disposal, but\nrather the capitalist. The consequence is that the product of  her\nlabour is objectified and appears as external to herself  rather than\nas an affirmation of  herself, her species being. Thus while the\nworker invests her energies and life in the production of  the\ncommodity, it is a one-way relationship \u2013 a \u2018one-sided enrichment\nof  the object\u2019 (Ollman, 1976: 144) \u2013 for which she receives only\nmoney. The creative power, energy, thought and consideration that\nis required in order \u2018to make something vanishes into the object of\nalienated production, which in turn is not replaced by other\nrevitalising creative power\u2019 (Yuill, 2005: 135). Hochschild concurs\nwith the idea of  a \u2018one-sided enrichment\u2019 when she states that\nwhen the product \u2018is a smile, a mood, a feeling, or a relationship, it\ncomes to belong more to the organization and less to the self\u2019 (p.\n198). This is because for the cabin crew in Hochschild\u2019s study, their\nsmiles \u2018were seen as an extension of  the make-up, the uniform, the\nrecorded music, the soothing pastel colours of  the airplane decor,\nand the daytime drinks, which taken together orchestrate the mood\nof  the passengers\u2019 (p. 8). Hochschild, like Marx, sees this\nestrangement from the product of  labour as having a human cost\nfor emotional labourers. While Marx makes the general point that\nalienated labour \u2018mortifies the flesh and ruins the mind\u2019,\nHochschild is more specific and identifies emotive dissonance\namongst many cabin crew where they experience \u2018burnout\u2019, feeling\n\u2018phoney\u2019 and \u2018emotional deadness\u2019 (see Jansz & Timmers, 2002).\nEmotive dissonance is the result of  the worker\u2019s investing\nemotionally in her performance over a prolonged period. The\ncumulative effect is that she suffers an emotional malnourishment\nThe Alienated Heartcaused by an insufficient revitalising return on her investment.\nHochschild argues that there comes a breaking point between the\nreal and acted self, and that as a matter of  self-protection she is\nforced to \u2018divide\u2019: \u2018some workers conclude that only one self\n(usually the non-work self) is the real self. Others, and they are the\nmajority, will decide that each self  is meaningful and real in its own\ndifferent way and time\u2019 (p. 132).\nHochschild appears to argue that emotional labour elicits a\nmore profound form of  alienation than even Marx imagined. This\nis because the majority of  workers can only cope with their\nestrangement by \u2018fusing\u2019 their commercialised selves with their\nreal, \u2018private sphere\u2019 selves. Hochschild\u2019s argument, therefore,\nimplies that Marx underestimated the potency of  alienation when\nhe stated that \u2018the worker only feels himself  when he is not\nworking\u2019 (1975: 326). \nLabour process alienation \nClosely allied to product alienation is labour process alienation,\nwherein workers lack control over the process of  production \u2013 that\nis, the conditions under which we work, how our work is organised,\nwhat we produce and the effect it has on our health (Cox, 1998). For\nMarx, by wresting control of  the labour process, capital denudes us\nof  our intrinsic capacity to work creatively and transforms it into\nits opposite. Thus a worker experiences \u2018power as impotence \u2026\n[and his] own physical and mental energy, his personal life \u2026 as an\nactivity directed against himself, which is independent of  him and\ndoes not belong to him\u2019 (1975: 327). \nAnother dimension to labour process alienation is the fact that\nwork is under the control of  forces hostile to us. This is because\nowing to the competitive nature of  capitalism, managers are under\nconstant pressure to extract more value from the worker, thereby\ncheapening the worth of  the individual to capitalism. As\ncapitalism develops and corporations grow larger, there is a\ngeneral tendency for work to be designed to achieve ever-greater\neconomies of  scale, unit efficiencies and labour productivity,\nthereby enhancing the importance of  the productive process, its\nlogistics and technologies over the skills and value of  the\nindividual. The result is that \u2018the special skill of  each individual,\ninsignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity\nbefore the science, the gigantic physical forces, and mass of  labour\nthat are embodied in the factory mechanism \u2019 (Marx, 1976: 548),\nand the \u2018idiosyncrasies of  the worker appear increasingly as mere\nsources of  error\u2019 (Luk\u00e1cs, 1974: 89). \n16\nCapital & Class 9817\nHochschild echoes Marx and Luk\u00e1cs when she argues that\ncontemporary service jobs \u2018are now socially engineered and\nthoroughly organised from the top\u2019 (p. 8). Yet management\u2019s control\nof  workers\u2019 display and performance is contradictory and unstable.\nShe details how, during cabin-crew training, airlines seek to\nsuppress workers\u2019 negative emotions, which are largely borne of\ntheir experience of  the service labour process where they are\n\u2018treated with disrespect or anger by a client, [yet] all the while\ncloseting into fantasy the anger one would like to respond with\u2019 (pp.\n85-86). For her, companies\u2019 efforts to control the service labour\nprocess is an estranging experience in which \u2018the more seriously\nsocial engineering affects our behaviour and our feelings, the more\nintensely we must address a new ambiguity about who is directing\nthem (is this me or the company talking?)\u2019 (p. 34). Moreover,\nHochschild is at pains to highlight the alienation that derives from\nthe progressive devaluing of  a worker\u2019s creative contribution\nthrough the increasing rationalisation of  the labour process.\nHochschild shows how the worker is no more than an appendage to\nthe externally imposed smile factory system, and her personal,\ndefensive responses are treated by employers as \u2018mere sources of\nerror\u2019, such as offering \u2018a thin crust of  display\u2019 (p. 21) in order to\ncope with management\u2019s ever increasing customer service targets. \nFor Hochschild, new forms of  deskilling compound the\nalienation generated by the corporate control of  the labour\nprocess, and the ever-greater competitive pressures to rationalise\nthe service production system. Following Braverman (1974), she\nargues that there is a tendency for the \u2018mind\u2019 of  the work process\nto \u2018move up the hierarchy leaving jobs de-skilled and workers de-\nvalued\u2019 (p. 119). For example, cabin crew training on how to deal\nwith angry passengers is a form of  deskilling. This is because the\n\u2018mind of  the emotion worker, the source of  the ideas about what\nmental moves are needed to settle down an \u201cirate\u201d has moved\nupstairs in the hierarchy so that the worker is restricted to\nimplementing standard procedures\u2019 (p. 120). \nIn summary, Hochschild\u2019s theory of  emotional labour explicitly\nargues that workers are systematically alienated from their service\nproduct and the labour process that determines the form and\ntiming of  its manufacture. However, while her explicit theorisation\npeters out beyond the immediacy of  workplace relations, she does\nprovide a partial analysis of  the impact of  emotional labour on\nwider capitalist social relations. As a result, it is possible to argue\nthat her thesis, rather than rejecting the remaining two dimensions\nof  Marx\u2019s theory of  alienation, instead possesses the potential for\ntheir acceptance and integration. \nThe Alienated HeartHuman nature alienation\nHuman nature alienation is that aspect of  alienation which\naddresses the damaging and distorting effects of  capitalist society\non our species being. For while capitalism has immeasurably\nenhanced our collective capacity to transform the world through\nmedicine, travel, communication, modern agriculture, etc. in the\ninterests of  all, this capacity is thwarted. This is because capitalism\nsuppresses our potential to realise our collective species being,\nbased as it is on an anarchic drive for profits, competition, class\ndivision and exploitation. Hochschild appears to hint at an\nunderstanding of  the way capitalism\u2019s capacity to meet the needs\nand desires of  humanity is thwarted by its need to put profit before\nall else: \nMassive people-processing \u2013 and the advanced engineering of\nemotional labor that makes it possible \u2013 is a remarkable\nachievement. It is also an important one, for a good part of\nmodern life involves exchange between total strangers, who in\nthe absence of  countermeasures and in the pursuit of  short-\nterm interest, might much of  the time act out suspicion and\nanger rather than trust and good will \u2026 But like most great\nachievements, the advanced engineering of  emotional labour\nleaves new dilemmas in its wake, new human costs. (p. 187)\nHochschild is ambiguous, however, as to whether she believes\nthe costs of  emotional labour to be removable without replacing\nthe whole process of  commodification of  emotions or, more\nsimply, reorganising the process. At several points, she seems to\nsuggest that workers can avert alienation by successfully managing\ntheir \u2018true self\u2019: \u2018When feelings are successfully commercialized,\nthe worker does not feel phoney or alien; she feels somehow\nsatisfied in how personal her service actually was. Deep acting is a\nhelp in doing this, not a source of  estrangement\u2019 (p. 136).\nThis is a shift away from Marx\u2019s theorisation of  alienation as a\nsystemic dimension of  capitalist relations of  production, and\ntowards one that posits it as primarily an individualised,\npathological condition that can be \u2018treated\u2019 within capitalist social\nrelations. Indeed, subsequent writers have drawn on this\ninconsistency to argue that it is possible to remove the alienating\npsychological costs of  emotional labour by redesigning the work to\nensure greater autonomy and control for the individual (Wharton,\n1996; Ashworth & Humphrey, 1993). In short, Hochschild\u2019s\nambiguous theorisation and her inconsistencies on the nature of\nalienation and its existence beyond the immediate realm of\n18\nCapital & Class 9819\nworkplace relations serve to blunt her overall critique of  the\ngeneric commodification of  human feelings. \nConversely, Hochschild also suggests that capitalism\u2019s\ndeepening and spreading market relations have a cumulative spill-\nover effect into wider society. In her 2003 afterword to The Managed\nHeart, she refers to the increasing take-up of  \u2018personal services\u2019 and\nthe way private life is progressively invaded and shaped by\ncommodified emotional labour, suggesting a \u2018vital link between\nlarger social contradictions and private efforts to manage feeling\u2019\n(p. 202). These contradictions, she states, which generate emotional\nstrain between the real and false selves, now exist not only at work\nbut also at home, and increasingly \u2018in between\u2019 work and home.\nThus she tentatively hints at the possibility of  an analysis that\nwould highlight emotional labour\u2019s alienating, corrosive effects\nbeyond the workplace. \nFellow beings alienation and commodity fetishism \u2018\nFellow beings alienation\u2019 refers to social relations between individuals\nthat increasingly take the form of  relationships between\ncommodities. In a society based on the production and consumption\nof  commodities, the pervasiveness of  commodities can seem an\ninevitable, even a natural state of  affairs (Luk\u00e1cs, 1974; May, 2006).\nMarx states that under capitalism, the wealth of  society appears as an\n\u2018immense collection of  commodities\u2019, with the commodity becoming\na \u2018universal category of  society as a whole\u2019 (Marx, 1976: 125). \nFor Marx, this generates a multi-dimensional phenomenon\nthroughout capitalist society, which he calls \u2018commodity fetishism\u2019\n(1976). Consequently, we experience relationships with each other\nnot as individuals, but as if  we were extensions of  capitalism\n(Ollman,  1976). As capitalism develops, commodification\nencroaches and invades our lives to the point at which a life outside\nmarket relations and independent of  commodities is unimaginable.\nEven the most intimate aspects of  our lives are touched and shaped\n(Hochschild, 2004), for from cars, washing machines, art, dating,\ndog walking and customer service to the ever-present commercial\nimages of  beauty, success and happiness, our lives and self-\nconcepts are inscribed by commodification. Whatever the personal\nor social usefulness of  these commodities, their exchange value\ntakes precedence. Consequently, \u2018things\u2019 dominate our existence.\nEven as consumers, we are alienated thanks to our enmeshed\ndependence on the market, where \u2018the very character of  man is at\nthe mercy of  his products, of  what they make him want and\nbecome in order to get what he wants\u2019 (Ollman, 1976: 146).\nThe Alienated HeartIndividuals also relate to each other in society as objectified\nbearers of  the commodities that they produce, possess and\nconsume. The consequence is that commodities acquire social and\nhuman characteristics, as with \u2018cool\u2019, \u2018sophisticated\u2019 and \u2018sexy\u2019\nbrands, owing to our entering into social relationships based on the\namount (especially money) and quality of  commodities we possess\n(Lodziak, 2002). Our social interactions are also determined by our\nplace and function in the market as managers, staff  members, sales\nassistants, customers, clients, professionals, unemployed workers\nand so on. Thus we encounter each other in competitive market\nrelationships in which we are either in an inferior or a superior\nposition (Cox, 1998). In other words, we are reified individuals and\nenter into reified relationships as the bearers of  economic\nrelations. As such, we are the personification of  the commodities\nwe possess (Luk\u00e1cs, 1974).\nReification necessarily generates an obscuring of  the actual\nsocial relations that lie behind the production of  any commodity.\nWe connect with our fellow humans through the lens of\ncommodities, where all knowledge of  and understanding of  how\nand why our fellow humans produced the thing is submerged\nbeneath a fetishised embrace of  a commodity\u2019s assumed and\nclaimed properties (Ollman, 1976). One example of  a fetishised\nembrace is that of  customer service. As customers, we expect sales\nstaff  to respect and value us irrespective of  whether that respect\nand value is sincere. Thus commodity fetishism\n7 is the process\nwhereby human relationships are reified as exchange values,\nhuman qualities are invested in material commodities, and real\nsocial relations of  production are obscured to the point at which\nthe world of  markets and commodities appears to be almost\nindependent of  human design. \nHochschild does not acknowledge fellow beings alienation and\ncommodity fetishism as being a dimension to Marx\u2019s theory, nor to\nher own. However, as in the case of  human nature alienation, her\ntheorisation does not close off  its existence. Indeed, The Managed\nHeart is replete with references to and examples of  commodity\nfetishism. She shows how cabin crews\u2019 existence as commodified\nlabour power generates a fetishised discourse on their worth as\nthings. Managers continually remind them of  their disposability\ndue to competition for cabin crew jobs. Even more starkly,\nmanagers refer to them as \u2018bodies for the flight\u2019 and \u2018breakage\u2019\nwhen they are too ill to work (p. 136). Hochschild recognises this as\nreification when she explains that \u2018surface and deep acting in a\ncommercial setting \u2026 make one\u2019s face and feelings take on the\nproperties of  a resource \u2026 to be used to make money\u2019 (p. 55). She\n20\nCapital & Class 9821\nfurther explains that this is underpinned by a broader process\ncentred on a corporate logic in the airline industry, which makes \u2018a\nseries of  links between competition, market expansion, advertising,\nheightened passenger expectations about rights to display, and\ncompany demands for acting\u2019 (p. 90). This can reasonably be\ninterpreted as the construction of  a reified, \u2018taken for granted\u2019\nperspective by workers on the naturalness of  their being treated as\nthings. \nWhile Hochschild\u2019s arguments are largely consistent with the\nconcept of  commodity fetishism at the level of  workplace\nrelations, she is ambiguous as to the extent to which it exists in\nother spheres of  commodified social relations. Her theoretical\nambiguity, however, does not preclude the occasional tantalising\ncommentary on the damaging impact of  emotional labour in wider\nsociety:\nEstrangement from display, from feeling, and from what feel-\nings can tell us is not simply the occupational hazard of  a few.\nIt has firmly established itself  in the culture as imaginable. All\nof  us know the commercialization of  human feeling at one\nremove \u2013 as witness, consumer, or critic \u2013 and have become\nadept at recognizing and discounting commercialised feeling.\n\u2018Oh, they have to be friendly, that\u2019s their job\u2019. (pp. 189\u201390)\nThe significance of  Hochschild\u2019s ambiguity is that she leaves\nopen the theoretical door to the argument that away from the\nimmediacy of  workplace relations, capitalist society possesses\nspaces free from alienation, whereas Marx\u2019s commodity fetishism\ntheory makes plain that in a society based on commodity\nproduction, there is no escape from alienation. As Meszaros\nexplains, \u2018selling is the practice of  alienation [as] alienation is\ncharacterized by the universal extension of  \u201csaleability\u201d [and] by\nthe conversion of  human beings into \u201cthings\u201d so that they could\nappear as commodities on the market\u2019 (2005 [1970]: 35).\nCommodity fetishism is central to Marx\u2019s theory of  class\nconsciousness and class struggle. This is because commodity\nfetishism produces the appearance \u2018that class exploitation is not a\nsocial product but the inevitable and unalterable result of  the\nfunctioning of  the market\u2019 (Rees, 1998: 95). Class distinctions are\nalso submerged by the common experience of  being a customer.\nThis is particularly acute in contemporary \u2018consumer capitalism\u2019\nThe Alienated Heart\nCommodity fetishism, class consciousness and resistance thanks to the ideological elevation in status of  consumers over\nproducers through the \u2018myth of  consumerism\u2019 (Lodziak, 2002),\nwherein workers and billionaires appear to possess, in equal\nmeasure, \u2018customer sovereignty\u2019. Commodity fetishism, therefore,\nis the harbinger of  a distorted ideology peculiar to capitalism in\nwhich \u2018all men and their circumstance appear upside-down as in a\ncamera obscura\u2019 (Marx & Engels, 1970 [1845]:  47). As such, under\ncapitalism \u2018widespread social beliefs become so distorted that they\nare insufficient for understanding the social conditions which have\nproduced such beliefs\u2019 (Billig, 1999: 314).\nCommodity fetishism may dominate the everyday consciousness\nof  workers, but it is not an \u2018iron cage\u2019 of  ideological distortion. This\nis because the wage-labour relationship comprises a central\ncontradiction that acts as a countertendency to commodity fetishism.\nThus, although capitalists treat workers\u2019 labour power as if  it were\nanother purchased tool to be exploited intensely, it is unlike any\nother commodity, for it is not possible to separate the worker from\nthe labour power itself. When an item is bought from a shop, full\nownership and control of  the commodity passes to the consumer.\nHowever, the price, content and duration of  labour power are\nsubject to continual haggling. Moreover, the \u2018worker brazenly\naccompanies his labor power right into the workplace and stands\nprotectively by it\u2019 while arguing \u2018about the terms of  its sale\u2019 (Rees,\n1998: 221). For Luk\u00e1cs (1974), this central contradiction corrodes and\nprises open the grip of  commodity fetishism. This is because the\nreified \u2018laws\u2019 of  the market accept as reasonable this daily struggle \u2013\nantinomy \u2013 but cannot resolve the contradiction (Rees, 1998).\nWorkers, therefore, are compelled to address the social reality\nof  their commodification and its exchange as a struggle for justice\nand dignity against exploitation and abuse by the capitalist.\nThrough this experience, nascent working-class consciousness\nemerges and begins to oppose the distortions of  commodity\nfetishism, with the potential for workers to collectively \u2018use this\ninsight to unravel all the other mystifications of  human relations\nthat have taken on the appearance of  relations between things\u2019\n(Rees, 1998: 222). Thus a contradictory consciousness exists within\nclasses and individuals, comprising a dialectical relationship\nbetween commodity fetishism as bourgeois ideology, and class\nconsciousness. Alienation, therefore, is never a complete process\nbut is instead a contradictory one that generates the potential for\nconscious resistance by workers to commodity fetishism and its\nunderpinning, dehumanising social relations.\nThe Managed Heart offers argument and evidence that supports\nthis analysis of  the relationship between commodity fetishism and\n22\nCapital & Class 9823\nclass consciousness, without itself  utilising either concept.\nHochschild\u2019s \u2018transmutation of  feelings\u2019 is an unstable state,\nvulnerable to the contradictions of  capitalist accumulation\nprocesses, as she explains: \u2018When an industry speed-up drastically\nshortens the time available between flight attendants and\npassengers, it can become virtually impossible to deliver emotional\nlabour. In that event, the transmutation of  emotion work, feeling\nrules, and social exchange will fail\u2019 (p. 121). The instability of\ntransmutation arises, for the most part, from the central\ncontradiction intrinsic to the wage-labour relationship: the daily\nstruggle over the terms of  sale of  workers\u2019 emotional labour,\nparticularly in an increasingly competitive environment:\nThe companies worry that competitors may produce more\npersonal service than they do, so they continue to press for\n\u2018genuinely friendly\u2019 service. But they feel compelled to keep\nthe conveyor belt moving faster and faster. For workers, the\njob of  \u2018enjoying the job\u2019 becomes harder and harder. Rewards\nseem less intrinsic to the work, more compensation for the\narduousness of  it. (p. 125)\nHochschild explains that when management is seeking to\nintensify emotional labourers\u2019 work, there is a corresponding\nreaction by many workers that undermines any such efforts, and\nprotects the workers\u2019 perceived value of  their labour power:\nThe company exhorts them to smile more, and \u2018more sin-\ncerely\u2019, at an increasing number of  passengers. The workers\nrespond to the speed-up with a slowdown: they smile less\nbroadly, with a quick release and no sparkle in the eyes, thus\ndimming the company\u2019s message to the people. It is a war of\nsmiles. (p.127)\nHochschild\u2019s \u2018war of  smiles\u2019 can be seen as a breach in the wall\nof  commodity fetishism that allows class consciousness to emerge.\nAs management\u2019s speed-up bites, trade unionism gives expression\nto workers\u2019 \u2018accumulated resentment and discontent\u2019 (p. 126). This\nburgeoning class consciousness is also evident in reactions to those\nworkers who respond positively to management\u2019s work\nintensification: they \u2018become the \u201crate-busters\u201d who are resented by\nother workers\u2019 (p. 130). Thus Hochschild acknowledges that there\nare contradictions in the commodification of  emotional labour that\ngenerate resistance to management\u2019s control of  the labour process\n\u2013 \u2018As one veteran put it: \u201cThe more the company sees the battle, the\nThe Alienated Hearttougher they get with the regulations. They define them more\nprecisely. They come up with more categories and more\ndefinitions. And more emotionalizing. And then, in time, we reject\nthem even more\u201d\u2019 (p. 130). \nHochschild\u2019s analysis, therefore, interprets resistance to\nexploitation and subordination \u2013 and its accompanying\nundermining of  commodity fetishism \u2013 as being generated by the\ncontradictory nature of  wage (emotional) labour.\nHochschild\u2019s account of  resistance demonstrates that she\nunderstands that workers are reflexive and possess the agency to\nbegin to challenge their alienation. This contradicts a commonly\nmade criticism of  her thesis, namely that she presents emotional\nlabourers as \u2018crippled actors\u2019 in that their \u2018transmutation of  feelings\u2019\nimplies they cannot exert an active and controlling force in\nrelationships with management and customers (Bolton & Boyd,\n2003; Bolton, 2005). This is because Hochschild is said to imbue\nmanagement\u2019s feeling rules with such dominance that the\nperformance of  customer service becomes an atomised experience\nfor the worker, where emotional reassessment is anaesthetised by\nalienation. This is evidently not the case, for Hochschild clearly\ntheorises workers\u2019 transmutation of  feelings as being inherently\nunstable owing to the daily playing-out of  the struggle at the\nfrontier of  control of  emotional labour power. Equally, she is able\nto explain how the breakdown of  \u2018transmutation of  feelings\u2019\nfrequently transforms itself  into conscious, organised resistance.\nNevertheless, such is the frequency of  the \u2018crippled actors\u2019 charge\nand its milder form of  Hochschild\u2019s theory being too \u2018one-\ndimensional\u2019 (Callaghan & Thompson, 2002: 248), that her account\nof  resistance requires more detailed critical assessment. \nSince The Managed Heart, competition, restructuring and work\nintensification have fuelled unionisation and militancy in the\nairline industry globally (Blyton, 2001), and the resistive \u2018emotional\nlabour\u2019 of  cabin crew has proved a rich source of  empirical study\n(e.g. Linstead, 1995; Tyler & Taylor, 2001; Bolton & Boyd, 2003).\nIndeed, Linstead\u2019s (1995) account of  the 1993 strike by Cathay\nPacific cabin crew against staff  cuts and the consequent speeding-\nup of  work appears to take up the \u2018story\u2019 where Hochschild leaves\noff. In it, Linstead captures the contradictory struggle between\nmanagement\u2019s normative (and gendered) emotional demands, and\nthe class-conscious nature of  resistance to them: \u2018In the\nadvertisements, the Cathay girls fix sultry smile then avert their\n24\nCapital & Class 98\n\u2018Crippled actors\u2019 or resistive agents? 25\nfaces with Asian humility \u2026 this servile image has been smashed\nby the perfumed picket line which has shown itself  to be tough,\nresilient and well orchestrated\u2019 (p. 200).\nWhile the airline industry represents the best example of\nmilitant trade unionism by emotional labourers, there is also\nevidence that in their day-to-day activities, cabin-crew \u2018remain very\naware \u2026 that they are offering an empty performance \u2026 without ever\nbuying-in to the norms set by the company\u2019 (Bolton & Boyd, 2003:\n301). Moreover, there exists a plethora of  evidence from other\nservice industries of  day-to-day, informal individual and collective\nresistance, irrespective of  a union presence (e.g. Ogbonna & Harris,\n2004; Sandiford, 2007). Thus in call centres, Mulholland found that\n\u2018sales sabotage, working to rule, work avoidance, absenteeism and\nhigh turnover are expressions of  a workplace antagonism rooted in\nand against the social relations of  production\u2019 (2004: 720). Moreover,\nworkers invariably direct their resistance against customers as well\nas against managers. In betting shops, Filby (1992) found that while\nwomen are employed for their \u2018figures\u2019, their \u2018personality\u2019 and their\n\u2018bums\u2019, they exploited their sexualised emotional labour to assert\ninformal control by developing a culture of  sexual humour to\nridicule and humiliate male managers and unpleasant \u2018punters\u2019.\nLikewise, Taylor and Bain\u2019s (2003b) call-centre research found that\nworkplace activists used a culture of  humour to subvert anti-union\nmanagerial authority in their campaign for trade union recognition.\nThus, Taylor (1998: 99) is correct to argue that workers experience\nan \u2018incomplete transmutation\u2019, and that as a resource for the\ncreation of  surplus value, the emotional labour of  service\nemployees is a \u2018double-edged sword\u2019 (Filby, 1992). \nStudies on resistance amongst emotional labourers in a range of\nservice settings tend to highlight the triadic nature \u2013 which includes\nthe customer \u2013 of  the labour process (Korczynski, 2002; Sandiford,\n2007). Likewise, many point to the existence of  shifting boundaries at\nthe \u2018frontier of  control\u2019 (e.g. Tyler & Taylor, 2001; Taylor & Bain,\n2003a), where \u2018management control of  emotional labour can be partial,\nincoherent and often contradictory\u2019 (Taylor, 1998: 100). This is due to\nthe \u2018exacerbated\u2019 labour indeterminacy of  emotional production\n(Bolton, 2005: 62), as management struggles to control the thoughts,\nfeelings and behaviours of  workers during customer interaction.\nAccordingly, service regimes are commonly marked by a process of\ninformal, \u2018continual negotiation and re-negotiation [with\nmanagement\/customers] over the transformation of  emotional labour\npower into a serviceable product\u2019 (Callaghan & Thompson, 2002: 251). \nIt is not surprising, therefore, that Hochschild\u2019s notion of  a\n\u2018successful transmutation of  feelings\u2019 should risk appearing to\nThe Alienated Heartconsign workers to a disabling, fetishised state. This is a consequence\nof  her partial application of  Marx\u2019s theory of  alienation, which\ndisallows an explicit conceptualisation explaining the contradictory\nexperience of  emotional labour dialectically. Thus she is unable to\nproduce a conceptualisation of  workers\u2019 consciousness as\ncontradictory and their agency as constrained, comprising an\nantagonistic interrelationship between the twin potentialities of\nemotional assimilation of  feeling rules and class-conscious\nresistance. Such a theorisation would enable an explicit explanation\nof  how workers retain and exercise sufficient control over their\nemotional labour so as to alleviate their day-to-day working lives \u2013\nor even to exert a counter controlling force in relationships with\nmanagement and customers (Callaghan & Thompson, 2002). \nWhile Hochschild does not, in her theory, close off  the potential\nfor the type of  daily getting by and getting back activities outlined\nabove, she largely omits an explicit analysis of  them. Moreover, her\nlack of  a theorisation of  class means that she does not possess the\nconceptual armoury to account for them as preconditions and\nprecursors to more class-conscious acts of  resistance, in contrast to\nmore recent, Marxist oriented labour process analysis (LPA)\nstudies of  emotional labourers (e.g. Taylor, 1998; Taylor & Bain,\n2003a,  2003b; Mulholland, 2004). These studies have sought to\novercome this weakness by arguing for the integration of  the\nemotional labour concept with LPA\u2019s theorisation of  relations of\nproduction as antagonistic and contradictory, thereby producing \u2018a\ncomplex interplay of  compliance, consent and resistance\u2019 (Taylor,\n1998: 100). Nevertheless, to date there has not been a detailed and\nsystematic assessment of  Hochschild\u2019s theoretical adequacy from\nwithin the LPA tradition. \nFinally, it should be noted that Hochschild explores the\nexperience of  emotional labour principally through the\nindividualised, conceptual lens of  her distinction between\nindividuals\u2019 surface and deep acting, and \u2018transmutation of  feelings\u2019\n(Bolton, 2005). By focusing on the immediacy of  the individualised\ncommodification process, in contrast with the LPA approach, she\ninsufficiently locates her analysis in the wider context of  workplace\nclass relations. Thus, she underemphasises the basis, form and\nsignificance of  collectively forged organisational space for worker\nagency and activity outside and within the commodification\nprocess. Yet a lack of  emphasis is not the same thing as a theoretical\nclosure, as Bolton and Boyd (2003) and Bolton (2005) have argued.\nRather, Hochschild\u2019s portrayal of  the emotional labour workplace is\none in which consent, indifference and conscious resistance by\nworkers are ever present, but are unduly overshadowed by her\n26\nCapital & Class 9827\nconceptual foregrounding of  the deleterious impact on individuals\nfrom the commodification of  their emotions. \nThe Managed Heart may suffer from theoretical ambiguities,\ninconsistencies and gaps, but its core arguments remain tenable\nwithin the context of  a classical Marxist analysis (Rees, 1998).\nHochschild convincingly argues that the commodification of\nemotions is an acutely alienating variant of  wage labour that\nsystemically pits emotional labourers into a daily struggle to secure\na dignified sense of  self. It is fought out in the context of\nmanagement\u2019s continual search for enhanced performance, driven\nby intensifying capital accumulation strategies. Emotional labourers\nexperience this pressure collectively and, as Hochschild\ndemonstrates, frequently resist it through trade unionism. Her\nthesis, therefore, offers a trenchant critique of  the harm caused by\nthe production of  customer service \u2013 and the commodification of\nemotions more generally \u2013 as a core feature of  so-called \u2018consumer\ncapitalism\u2019. In doing so, The Managed Heart can be said to be an early\nexample of  contemporary anticapitalist-style critiques of\nconsumerism and the profound alienation suffered by its producers. \nThe Managed Heart\u2019s legacy remains a powerful one, if\ntheoretically enigmatic. As with all eclectic endeavours, there\nexists the risk that divorcing a concept from its wider theoretical\nfoundations might diminish its potency and explanatory power.\nWhile this is so with Hochschild, it is also the case that her\ntheorisation leaves sufficient space for a more rigorous and\npolitically potent analysis to emerge that restores the full range of\nexplanatory power to Marx\u2019s theory of  alienation in its application\nto emotional labour. In this era of  growing global resistance to\nrampant commodification, a resilient and damning critique of\nemotional labour is of  vital necessity. \nAshworth, B. E. & R. H.

After reading an earlier draft of\nthis article, she commented, \u2018It really made me think about alienation\nin a larger way\u2019 (2007). She is not alone in offering a partial rendering\nof  alienation, e.g. Barbalet (2001) and Lodziak (2002). \n4 Heller (1978) provides a rare example of  a Marxian attempt to\ntheorise emotion in relation to alienation. She argues that as\ncapitalism develops, it generates dominant ideological notions of\nemotional appropriateness that are dependent on the needs of  capital\nand bourgeois society more generally. Thus it is possible to interpret\nthe increasing reification of  customer norms throughout society, and\ntheir attendant emotional requirements, as a product of  contemporary\n\u2018consumer capitalism\u2019.  \n5 Hochschild is vague on whether all forms of  wage labour comprising\nemotional displays constitute alienating emotional labour. She\nsuggests that the all-important distinction is whether or not there is\n\u2018exploitation of  the bottom by the top\u2019. Therefore, \u2018It is not emotional\nlabour itself  but the underlying system of  recompense that raises the\nNotes31\nquestion of  what the cost of  it is\u2019 (p. 12). Yet Hochschild does not\nattempt to theorise what might constitute an exploitation of\nemotional labour. \n6 Hochschild deliberately chooses a \u2018grand word\u2019 here (p. 19). Her usage\nis designed to express the grievous nature of  the process, not to imply\npermanent \u2018mutation\u2019.\n7 This concept has been greatly developed by Luk\u00e1cs (1974) as reification.\nThe Alienated Heart"}
