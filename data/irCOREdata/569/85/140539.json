The concept of failure delay time can be used in planning condition-based\nmaintenance policy (see [2], for example): if one can successfully detect the changing point,\nat which the process shifts from the first stage to the second stage, then we can conduct\nmaintenance during the second stage (before the system fails).\nControl charts, a tool from statistical process control (SPC), can be used to detect the\nchanging point. If we use SPC terminologies, the normal working state is said an in-control\nstate and the failure delay time state is said an out-of-control state. Control charts are\ncommonly employed for the purpose of signalling the occurrence of assignable causes every\ntime when the process parameter has shifted. As control charts may produce false signals\nthat incorrectly indicate the state of the system, optimally designing the parameters of\ncontrol charts to minimizing the cost incurred by the false signals is an important re-\nsearch topic. To this end, various scenarios have been considered by researchers. Tagaras\nand Lee [3] and Tagaras [4] separated the X\u00af-chart into several zones and optimized the\nchart for monitoring a process whose deterioration can be classified into two states in\nwhich one state requires minor repair and the other requires major repair, and considered\n1 Corresponding author.

Cassady et al [6] considered economic design of control charts\nfor optimization of preventive maintenance policies for systems. Chan and Wu [7] ap-\nply the concept of cumulative count of conforming chart (CCC chart) in inspection and\nmaintenance planning for systems where minor inspection, major inspection, minor main-\ntenance and major maintenance are available. Control charts have also been applied to\ncondition-based maintenance for monitoring two-stage processes that was mentioned in\nthe preceding paragraph (see [8] for example). Other examples of research in this area\ncan also been seen in [9,10]. Typical application areas of control charts can be found\nin continuous manufacturing processes such as canning lines, high precision component\nmachining centres, and electronic item assembly lines.\nCommonly, the decision variables in designing control charts include the sampling interval\nbetween consecutive sampling points, sample sizes or control limits. The parameters in\ncontrol charts can be fixed or variable, then we have two different control charts: static and\nadaptive. A static control chart has fixed parameters, including sample size n, sampling\ninterval h, lower control limit (LCL) and upper control limit (UCL), whereas an adaptive\ncontrol chart has at least one of its parameters (n, h, LCL and UCL) allowed to be changed\nbased on the information about the state of the process. Compared with the static control\ncharts, the adaptive control chart can utilise the inspection capacity more effectively for\na better process control ([11,12,13,14]). Recent research on adaptive control charts can be\nfound in [15,16,17,18].\nHowever, in existing literature, there has been little work in investigating the potential of\nthe adaptive control charts to monitor processes where a failure delay time exists. This\npaper presents the formulations of the expected long-run cost per time unit for such a\nprocess monitored by adaptive control charts with variable sampling intervals.\n3\nA system with a failure delay time is essentially a three-state system that is a typical\ncase of a multistate system. Research in multistate systems is another interesting topic in\nreliability theory and engineering, and the reader is referred to [19,20] for more information\nin this area.\nThe novelty of this paper lies in the formulations and analysis of the expected cost per\ntime unit for the scenarios where adaptive control charts are applied to monitor three-state\nsystems.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents assumptions and notation that are\nused in the paper. In order to compare the efficiency of static and adaptive control charts,\nSection 3 formulates the expected long-run cost per unit for a system monitored by static\nand adaptive charts respectively. Section 4 discusses the relationship between the formulas\nof the expected long-run cost per unit of the static and adaptive charts. Section 5 gives\nnumerical examples to study the sensitive analysis for various parameter settings. Section\n6 concludes the findings of this paper.\n2 General assumptions and notation\nThis section first presents the usage of the static and adaptive control charts, then makes\nassumptions for these two charts.\nConsider a system with three states: in-control, out-of-control and failed. It produces\noutputs that can be monitored by a control chart: either a static or an adaptive chart.\nStatic chart The sampling interval h is fixed. n samples are taken at every h time units.\nFigure 1 shows a typical example of a control chart with two zones: Zf0 is a central\nzone, Zf1 is an action zone, and they are defined as: Zf0={0, UCL}, Zf1 ={UCL,\u221e},\n4\nfor example. The following policy is adopted.\n\u2022 If the characteristics of the n samples falls in Zf0, no further action will be taken and\nthe next sampling interval will be h.\n\u2022 If the characteristics of the n samples falls in Zf1, then an inspection will be carried\nout to check the occurrence of assignable causes. If the occurrence is confirmed by\nthe inspection, then a minor repair is performed. Otherwise no further action will be\ntaken and the next sampling interval will be h.\nAdaptive chart The first sampling interval is h0 time units and the samples are taken\nimmediately after the start of the system. After that, n samples are taken at every h0\ntime units. Figure 2 shows a typical example of a control chart with three zones: Za0\nis a central zone, Za1 is a warning zone, Za2 is an action zone, and they are defined as:\nZa0 = {0, w}, Za1 = {w,UCL}, and Za2={UCL,\u221e}, for example. The following policy\nis adopted.\n\u2022 If the characteristics of the n samples falls in Za0, then the next sampling interval\nwill be h0 time units;\n\u2022 If the characteristics of the n samples falls in Za1, then the next sampling interval will\nbe h1 time units, and an inspection will be carried out to check whether the system\nis in control or not. If the system is confirmed to be in the out-of-control state, then\na minor repair is performed to restore the system, otherwise no further action will be\ntaken and the next sampling interval will be h0.\n\u2022 If the characteristics of the n samples falls in Za2, then an inspection will be carried\nout to check the occurrence of the assignable causes. If occurrence is confirmed, then\na minor repair is performed. Otherwise no further action will be taken and the next\nsampling interval will be h0, which is the same as normal.\nThe following assumptions are also held for both the static and the adaptive control\ncharts.\n5\n(1) Suppose that the system can shift either from an in-control state to an out-of-control\nstate and then to a failure state; or directly from an in-control state to an failure\nstate without going through an out-of-control state. The system itself in a failure\nstate or an out-of-control state cannot restore back to the in-control state without\nany repair.\n(2) When the system is in an in-control state or an out-of-control state, the defective\nprobability of the product is p0 or p1, respectively, where p1 > p0.\n(3) The inspection is assumed to be perfect in that it can reveal whether the system is in\ncontrol or not. During the inspection, the system carries on running. As long as the\nsystem has been confirmed to be in an out-of-control state, repairmen will carry out\na minor repair which can bring the system back to an in-control state. The system\nis as good as new immediately after the minor repair has been completed, and it is\nstill operating while it is under a minor repair. Once the system fails, repairmen will\nconduct a major repair that can bring it back to the as-good-as-new state.\n(4) For simplicity, times spent on an inspection, minor or major repair are small com-\npared with the sampling interval, and therefore are negligible, but their costs are\nconsidered.\nTh following notation is also used.\nX1: random time from the beginning of an in-control state to the occurrence of an\nassignable cause;\nf1(x1): pdf. of X1, and F1(x1) = Pr(X1 < x1) is the cdf. of X1;\nX2: random time from the beginning of the out-control state to failure;\nf2(x2): pdf. of X2, and F2(x2) = Pr(X2 < x2), cdf. of X2;\nn: sample size;\nh: sampling interval when a static control chart is used;\nh0: a longer sampling interval when an adaptive control chart is used;\n6\nh1: a shorter sampling interval when an adaptive control chart is used;\n\u03b1i: the probability that the characteristics of the n samples falls in Zf0 when the system\nis in the in-control state for i = 0, or in the out-of-control state for i = 1. It is for a\nstatic control chart, where \u03b10 + \u03b11 = 1.\n\u03b2ij: the probability that the characteristics of the n samples falls in Zaj (j = 0, 1, 2) when\nthe system is in the in-control state for i = 0, or in the out-of-control state for i = 1. It\nis for the adaptive control chart, where \u03b200 + \u03b201 + \u03b202 = 1 and \u03b210 + \u03b211 + \u03b212 = 1.\nTn: time to the first minor repair with an assignable cause when no control chart is used;\nTf1: the random time from the beginning of the in-control state to the occurrence of an\nassignable cause when a static control chart is used;\nTf2: time between the occurrence of an assignable cause and failure when a static control\nchart is used;\nTa1: expected time between the start of the system and a minor repair triggered by an\ninspection due to a warning signal in zone Za1;\nTa2: expected time between the start of the system and a minor repair triggered by an\ninspection due to a warning signal in zone Za2;\nTa3: expected time between the start of the system and a major repair;\ncs: sampling cost per item;\nci: inspection cost for a possible assignable cause;\ncr1: cost for a minor repair;\ncr2: cost for a major repair;\nCn: time to failure when no control chart is used;\nCf1, Cf2: costs incurred within times Tf1 and Tf1, respectively;\nCa1, Ca2, Ca3: costs incurred within times Ta1, Ta2 and Ta3, respectively. They are for an\nadaptive chart.\nThroughout the modelling development, we use the renewal reward theorem, which simply\n7\nstates that the expected long-run cost per time unit is the ratio between the expected\nrenewal cycle cost and expected renewal cycle length [21].\n3 Expected long-run cost per time unit\nThis section derives the expected long-run cost per time unit for both the static control\nchart scenario and the adaptive control chart scenario.\n3.1 No control chart scenario\nIn the case there is no control chart used to monitor the system, the expected long-run\ntime is given by\nE(Tn) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u222b x\n0\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx, (1)\nand the expected cost is\nE(Cn) = cr2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u222b x\n0\nf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx. (2)\nThe expected long-run cost per time unit is given by\nEn(T,C) =\nE(Cn)\nE(Tn)\n(3)\n3.2 Static control chart scenario\nIn the case when a static control chart is employed to monitor the system, the expected\ntime length and expected cost are derived as follows.\n8\n3.2.1 Expected time length\nThere can be two renewals: a renewal after a minor repair is conducted, and a renewal\nafter a major repair is completed. The expected renewal cycle length is E(Tf ) = E(Tf1)+\nE(Tf2).\nThen we have\nE(Tf1) =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\nih\ni\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1i\u2212j1 (1\u2212 \u03b11)\n\u222b jh\n(j\u22121)h\nf1(x1)[1\u2212 F2(ih\u2212 x1)]dx1. (4)\nProof. In this case, a renewal occurs after a minor repair is conducted at the ih time\npoint. There are i\u2212 j false signals followed by one true signal. The false signals wrongly\nindicate that the system is in an in-control state whereas it is actually in an out-of-control\nstate. The time length is ih that includes i sampling intervals in both the in-control state\nand the out-of-control state. 2\nThe expected value of Tf2 is given by\nE(Tf2) =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\ni\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1i\u2212j1\n\u222b ih\n(i\u22121)h\n\u222b \u03c4ij\n(j\u22121)h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx, (5)\nwhere \u03c4ij =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\njh if j < i;\nx if j = i.\nProof. In this scenario, There are i\u2212 j false signals followed by a failure. 2\nThe expected renewal cycle length E(Tf ) is the summation of E(Tf1) and E(Tf2), and it\nis given by\n9\nE(Tf ) =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\ni\u2211\nj=1\nih\u03b1i\u2212j1 (1\u2212 \u03b11)\n\u222b jh\n(j\u22121)h\nf1(x1)[1\u2212 F2(ih\u2212 x1)]dx1\n+\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\ni\u2211\nj=1\n\u03b1i\u2212j1\n\u222b ih\n(i\u22121)h\n\u222b \u03c4ij\n(j\u22121)h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx.

(7)\nHence, the expected long-run cost per time unit is given by\nEf (T,C) =\nE(Cf )\nE(Tf )\n. (8)\n3.3 Adaptive control chart scenario\nThere are two possible kinds of transition of the system: a transition from the in-control\nstate to the out-of-control state detected by signals either in the warning zone or in the\naction zone, and a transition from the out-of-control state to failure. We assume that any\nlevel of maintenance can renew the system.\n10\n3.3.1 Expected renewal cycle length\nThe expected renewal cycle length is E(Ta) = E(Ta1)+E(Ta2)+E(Ta3), which is explained\nas follows.\nThe expected time between the start and a minor repair triggered by an inspection due\nto a signal in zone Za1 is given by\nE(Ta1) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b2k1\u2212k210 \u03b2\nk3\n11\u03b211(1\u2212 \u03b210)H0\n\u222b H1\u2212h1\nH1\u2212h0\u2212h1\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 x1))dx1\n+ \u03b201\u03b2\nk1\u2212k2+1\n10 \u03b2\nk3+1\n11 (1\u2212 \u03b210)(H0 + h0 + h1)\n\u222b H1\nH1\u2212h1\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 + h0 + h1 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk2=0\n{\n\u03b201(1\u2212 \u03b210)H2\n\u222b H2\nH2\u2212h1\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H2 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n, (9)\nwhere H0 = k1h0 + (\u03b201(k2 \u2212 1) + k3 + 1)h1, H1 = k2h0 + (\u03b201(k2 \u2212 1) + 1)h1, and\nH2 = (k2 + 1)h0 + (\u03b201k2 + 1)h1.\nProof. The description of three units in Eq (9) is given below. There are three scenarios\nfor the system transiting from an in-control state to an out-of-control state. These three\nstates correspond to the following the three units in Eq (9).\nDenote k1 as the total number of longer sampling intervals (ie. h0) in both the in-control\nand out-of-control states, k2 as the total number of longer sampling intervals in an in-\ncontrol state, and k3 as the number of false signals followed by true ones in the out-of-\ncontrol state.\nUnit 1 The system transits from the in-control state to the out-of-control state in a longer\nsampling interval h0. Apparently, the effectiveness of the control chart is associated with\nthe length of an out-of-control state, but independent of the length of the in-control\nstate.\nWhen the system is in the out-of-control state, there might be false signals (with\n11\na probability of \u03b2k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 ) in h0, or true signals in h0 but followed by false signals in\nh1 (with a probability of (\u03b211\u03b210)\nk3). These two scenarios make up an event with a\nprobability of (\u03b210)\nk1\u2212k2\u2212k3(\u03b211\u03b210)k3(or \u03b2\nk1\u2212k2\n10 \u03b2\nk3\n11), and take time (k1 \u2212 k2)h0 + k3h1.\nEventually, a correct signal in h0 is followed by another correct signal in h1, which has\na probability of \u03b211(1\u2212 \u03b210) and a time length of h0 + h1.\nBefore the system has transited from the in-control state to the out-of-control state,\nthe time length is (k2\u2212 1)h0 +\u03b201(k2\u2212 1)h1. Hence, the total length is k1h0 + (\u03b201(k2\u2212\n1) + k3 + 1)h1 = H0. The transition occurs in the time interval ((k2 \u2212 1)h0 + \u03b201(k2 \u2212\n1)h1, k2h0 + \u03b201(k2 \u2212 1)h1), or (H1 \u2212 h0 \u2212 h1, H1 \u2212 h1).\nUnit 2 The system might also transit from the in-control state to the out-of-control state\nwithin a short sampling interval h1 after a false signal appears in the in-control state,\nbut a correct signal follows. This event has a probability of \u03b201\u03b210. A correct signal can\nappear in the sample of this short sampling interval. This event has a probability of\n\u03b201(1\u2212\u03b210) and a time length of h0+h1. The time length of the system in the in-control\nstate is (k2 \u2212 1)h0 + \u03b201(k2 \u2212 1)h1, then the transition from the in-control state to the\nout-of-control state occurs in (H1\u2212h1, H1) (where H1 = k2h0+\u03b201(k2\u22121)h1+h1). After\nthe system has transited to the out-of-control state, the probability of the appearance\nof a correct signal is given by \u03b2k1\u2212k2\u2212k310 (\u03b211\u03b210)\nk3\u03b211(1\u2212 \u03b210) (or \u03b2k1\u2212k210 \u03b2k3+111 (1\u2212 \u03b210))\nand has a time length of H0 + h0 + h1.\nUnit 3 When the system is in the in-control state, a false signal appears in a longer\nsampling interval h0. Then a short sampling interval is followed and the system transits\nto the out-of-control state in this short sampling interval, and then a true signal appears.\nThis event has a probability of \u03b201(1\u2212 \u03b210).2\nThe expected time between the start and a minor repair triggered by an inspection due\n12\nto a signal in zone Za2 is given by\nE(Ta2) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b2k1\u2212k210 \u03b2\nk3\n11\u03b212(H0 \u2212 h1)\n\u222b H1\u2212h1\nH1\u2212h0\u2212h1\nf1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 h1 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n.\n(10)\nProof. The proof is similar to that of E(Ta1), apart from the appearance of the out-of-\ncontrol signals in a longer interval h0 in this case. 2\nThe expected time between the start and a major repair is given by\nE(Ta3) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n\u03b2k1\u2212k210 \u03b2\nk3\n11\n{\u222b H0\u2212h1\nH0\u2212h0\u2212h1\n\u222b \u03c4k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h0\u2212h1\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+ \u03b211\n\u222b H0\nH0\u2212h1\n\u222b \u03c4k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h0\u2212h1\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+\n\u222b H0\u2212h1\nH0\u2212h0\u2212h1\n\u222b \u03c4 \u2032k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h1\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n+ \u03b211\n\u222b H0\nH0\u2212h1\n\u222b \u03c4 \u2032k1k2k3\nH1\u2212h1\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n}\n. (11)\nwhere \u03c4k1k2k3 =\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nH1 \u2212 h1 if k1 \u2212 k2 6= 0\nx if k1 \u2212 k2 = 0,\nand \u03c4\n\u2032\nk1k2k3\n=\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f3\nH1 if k1 \u2212 k2 6= 0\nx if k1 \u2212 k2 = 0.\nProof. The system might transit from the in-control state to the out-of-control state either\nin a longer sampling interval h0 or in a shorter sampling interval h1, and the system can\nthen fail in either h0 or h1 as well, which creates four scenarios. The first two components\nin Eq (11) correspond to the scenarios when the transition from the in-control state to the\nout-of-control state occurs in a h0, and the last two components in Eq (11) correspond\nto the scenarios when the transition from the in-control state to the out-of-control state\noccurs in a h1.\nThe first component in Eq (11) is the scenario when the two transitions (i.e., from the in-\ncontrol state to the out-of-control state and then fail) occur in longer sampling intervals.\n13\nThe second component means that a correct signal appears in a longer sampling interval\nh0 (with a probability \u03b211) followed by a shorter sampling interval h1 for confirmation,\nbut the system fails within this h1. The third component means that the transition from\nthe in-control state to the out-of-control state occurs (with a probability \u03b201 followed by\na shorter sampling interval). The last component means that the two scenarios occur in\nshort sampling intervals. 2\n3.3.2 Expected renewal cycle cost\nThe costs incurred during periods E(Tf1), E(Tf2), and E(Tf3) are derived in the following.\nE(Ca1) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b2k1\u2212k210 \u03b2\nk3\n11\u03b211(1\u2212 \u03b210)\n\u222b H1\u2212h1\nH1\u2212h0\u2212h1\nC0f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 x1))dx1\n+ \u03b201\u03b210\u03b2\nk1\u2212k2\n10 \u03b2\nk3\n11\u03b211(1\u2212 \u03b210)\n\u222b H1\nH1\u2212h1\nC1f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 + h0 + h1 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n+\n\u221e\u2211\nk2=0\n{\n\u03b201(1\u2212 \u03b210)\n\u222b H2\nH2\u2212h1\nC2f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H2 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n, (12)\nwhere C0 = (k1 + \u03b201(k2 \u2212 1) + k3 + 1)ncs + ((\u03b202 + \u03b201(1 \u2212 \u03b200))(k2 \u2212 1) + 1)ci + cr1,\nC1 = C0 + 2ncs, and C2 = k2ncs + \u03b201k2ncs + 2ncs + (\u03b202 + \u03b201(1\u2212 \u03b200))k2ci + ci + cr1.\nProof.After the system transited from an in-control state to an out-of-control state within\na longer interval h0, there will be two possible scenarios before two warning signals appear\nconsecutively in a longer interval and shorter interval, respectively. The first scenario is\nincorrect signals (with a probability of \u03b210) appears, the second scenario is a correct signal\nfollowed by an incorrect signal (with a probability of \u03b211\u03b210). These two scenarios makes\nup an event with a probability of (\u03b210)\nk1\u2212k2\u2212k3(\u03b211\u03b210)k3\u03b211(1\u2212\u03b210), and the event incurs\nsampling cost (k1\u2212 k2 + 1)ncs + (k3 + 1)ncs. Before the system has transited from the in-\ncontrol state to the out-of-control state, the sampling cost is k2ncs + \u03b201k2ncs, inspection\ncost (\u03b202 +\u03b201(1\u2212\u03b200)k2 + 1)ci and level 1 repair cost cr1. Hence, the sub-total cost is C0.\n14\nThe system might also transit from the in-control state to the out-of-control state within\na short interval h1 after a false signal appear in the in-control state. This event incurs\ncost ncs+ ci+ cr1. The cost incurred before the transition is k2ncs+\u03b201k2ncs+\u03b201\u03b201k2ci.\nThe sub-total cost is C1.\nA similar explanation to the third component in Eq (12) can be given. 2\nSimilarly, we have\nE(Ca2) =\n\u221e\u2211\nk1=1\nk1\u2211\nk2=1\nk1\u2212k2\u2211\nk3=0\n{\n\u03b2k1\u2212k210 \u03b2\nk3\n11\u03b212\n\u222b H1\u2212h1\nH1\u2212h0\u2212h1\nC3f1(x1)(1\u2212 F2(H0 \u2212 h0 \u2212 x1))dx1\n}\n(13)\nwhere C3 = C0 \u2212 ncs.

(15)\n15\n4 Discussion\n4.1 Comparison between the two types of control charts\nFor the static control chart, if we set UCL=\u221e and n = 0, then Eq. (6) becomes\nE(Tf ) =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\ni\u2211\nj=1\n\u222b ih\n(i\u22121)h\n\u222b \u03c4ij\n(j\u22121)h\nxf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx\n=\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nx\n\u222b x\n0\nf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx (16)\nEq. (7) becomes\nE(Cf ) =\n\u221e\u2211\ni=1\ni\u2211\nj=1\n\u222b ih\n(i\u22121)h\n\u222b \u03c4ij\n(j\u22121)h\ncr2f1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx,\n= cr2\n\u222b \u221e\n0\n\u222b x\n0\nf1(x1)f2(x\u2212 x1)dx1dx. (17)\nThen the expected cost per time unit,\nE(Cf )\nE(Tf )\nbased on Eq (17) and Eq (16), is the same\nas Eq (3) where no control chart is employed.\nSimilarly, if we set Za1 = \u03c6, or \u03b201 = \u03b211 = 0, then the adaptive np chart becomes\nthe static np control chart. Then we have E(Ta1) = E(Ca1) = 0, E(Ta2) = E(Tf1),\nE(Ta3) = E(Tf2), and E(Ca2) +E(Ca3) = E(Cf ). The expected costs per time unit from\nthe adaptive and static np control charts are the same.\nBy minimising Eq. (8) and Eq. (15), we can obtain the optimal h when using static\ncontrol charts and h0 and h1 when using adaptive control charts, respectively. For given\ncdf\u2019s (F1(x1) and F2(x2)) and costs, h, h0 and h1 can be obtained by using heuristic search\nalgorithms such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing [19].\n16\n4.2 Design procedure\nWhen designing an optimal inspection policy, one can adopt the following steps.\nIt is reasonable to assume that in practice we can obtain cost parameters cs, ci, cr1, cr2,\ncumulative distribution functions F1(x1) and F2(x2).\nIf the values of \u03b10, \u03b10 (where \u03b10 + \u03b11 = 1), \u03b200, \u03b201, and \u03b202 (where \u03b200 + \u03b201 + \u03b202 = 1),\n\u03b210, \u03b211, and \u03b212 (where \u03b210 + \u03b211 + \u03b212 = 1) are given, we can minimise the expected\ncosts in Eq. (8) and Eq. (15), respectively, to obtain the optimal values h0, h1, and n.\n5 Numerical experiments\nIn this section, we use both artificial generated data and real data for validating the\napproaches proposed in this paper.\n5.1 Artificial generated data\nAssume that F1(x1) = 1\u2212 exp(\u2212( x1300)2.5), and F2(x2) = 1\u2212 exp(\u2212( x2200)4). We also assume\nthe parameter values in Table 1 in this example.\nWith the parameter values listed in Table 1, we can compare the values of the expected\ncost per time unit derived by Eq (8) and Eq (15). Table 2 shows the expected cost per time\nunit against sampling intervals h for the system monitored with the static control chart.\nTable 3 shows the expected cost per time unit against longer sampling intervals h0 and\nshorter sampling intervals h1. For example, when h0 is 80, then h1 = 48 makes the expected\nvalue per time unit minimised (the minimised value is 3.510). This experiment offers the\n17\nfollowing optimal solutions for the static and adaptive control charts, respectively.\n\u2022 When h is 88, the expected cost per time unit achieves the minimal value 3.531847 for\nthe static control chart.\n\u2022 When h0 = 104, and h1 = 9, the expected long-run cost per time unit is 3.306189 for\nthe adaptive control chart.\nIt can be seen from the above solutions that the adaptive control chart is superior over the\nstatic control chart. However, for given sampling intervals, for example, h0 = h1 = h = 40,\nthen the optimal expected cost per time unit, Ea(T,C), incurred in the static control chart\ncase can be smaller than in the adaptive control chart case. This is because there is cost\nadded by an additional sampling interval h1 immediately followed by sampling interval\nwith another length h0 in the adaptive control chart case.\nTable 3 also indicates that for minimising the expected long-run cost per time unit a larger\nvalue h0 should be followed by a smaller value h1, whereas a smaller value h0 should be\nfollowed by a larger value h1, although in both cases h0 > h1. For example, when h0 is\nsmaller than 60, every long sampling interval h0 should be followed by the same length of\nshort sampling interval h1: the values of the two columns h1 and h0 are the same. When\nh0 is larger than 60, every long sampling interval h0 should be followed by the smaller\nlength of short sampling interval h1.\n5.2 Vibration data of bearings\nFigure 3 shows the data of the overall vibration level in root mean square (RMS) value of\nsix bearings. The data were collected from an accelerated laboratory experiment. It has\nbeen generally accepted in the case of vibration monitoring that a consistent increase in\nthe overall vibration level is a good indicator of the presence of a hidden defect which\n18\nindicates clearly a two-stage process [2,8].\nIf we use RMS=4.15 as a threshold: the RMS larger than 4.15 implies that the process is\nin the failure delay time and the RMS less than 4.15 suggests that the process is in the\nnormal working stage. We can obtain the exact time before each bearing passes over the\nthreshold. By treating these data as time-to-failure data and using maximum likelihood\nestimation, we can obtain that F1(x1) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212( x1161.58)0.72). Similarly, we can obtain\nF2(x2) = 1 \u2212 exp(\u2212( x278.62)1.80). Assume cs=0.08, ci=80, cr1=1500, cr2=5000, and n = 5,\nand the rest parameter values are the same as those in Table 1. Then we can obtain the\noptimal solution Ea(T,C) = 7.75 when an adaptive control chart with h0 = 13 and h1 = 1\nis used, whereas the optimal value Ef (T,C) = 7.95 when a static control with a sample\ninterval h = 9 is used.\n6 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we formulated the expected long-run cost per time unit for a three-state\nsystem monitored by an adaptive control chart with variable parameters and a control\nchart with static parameters. The adaptive control chart has variable sampling intervals:\nif the control chart signals that the system is near out-of-control at a time point, the\nsubsequent sampling will be conducted in a shorter time period.\nThe numerical example shows that applying an adaptive control chart to monitor a three-\nstate system is more cost effective than applying a static one. It also shows that for\neconomically maintaining a three state system, an adaptive control chart should be de-\nsigned to be that the length of the longer sampling interval should be inverse proportional\nto the length of the shorter sampling interval.\n19\nAcknowledgement\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions\nthat result in improvement of the quality of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] Christer, A.H., Waller, W.M., 1984.
