To explore whether other neurotrophins (NTs) of the NGF family, which are widely expressed in mouse skin, affect the numbers and\/or functions of MCs we examined the effects of NT-3 on neonatal skin MCs. We demonstrate that TrkC, the high affinity NT-3 receptor, is expressed by virtually all neonatal skin MCs in C57BL\/6 mice, which indicates that MCs can respond to NT-3. Skin of neonatal and early postnatal NT-3-overexpressing mice (promoter: K14) displayed significantly and up to twofold increased numbers of MCs during the first 20 days after birth, as compared to wild-type mice. To check whether this increase in MC numbers in NT-3 transgenic mice reflects a higher rate of proliferation, we performed immunohistochemistry, which revealed that only 1-2% of all skin MCs both in NT-3-overexpressing and in wild-type controls showed Ki-67-positive nuclei, suggesting that the observed differences in the number of MCs do not reflect a higher rate of MC proliferation. Additionally, we show that the effect of NT-3 on the number of MCs is most likely to be stem cell factor (SCF)-independent, because NT-3 significantly downregulates secretion of SCF-protein in cultured dermal fibroblasts, as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Numbers of skin MCs in neonatal TrkC-deficient mice were found to be modestly reduced, as compared to wild-type mice, indicating that NT-3 can modulate the number of MCs directly via TrkC, although TrkC does not seem to be essential for the number of basal MCs. To further analyze the effects of NT-3 on MCs, we stimulated skin organ culture of early postnatal C57BL\/6 mouse skin with 5-50 ng\/ml NT-3, which induced a significant increase in MC degranulation, as visualized by Giemsa staining. However, stimulation of isolated neonatal dermal skin MCs with NT-3 in vitro failed to result in MC activation, as measured by serotonin release.
