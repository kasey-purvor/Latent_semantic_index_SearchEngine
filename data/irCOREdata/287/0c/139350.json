Introduction 3 \nDemand of water is increasing day by day, accordingly recycling and reuse of 4 \nwater from various sources are being given due priority in recent times. Wastewater from 5 \nindustries, domestic wastewater, and municipal wastewater can be recycled after proper 6 \npurification. Recycling of textile effluent is very essential because, dyeing 1 kg of cotton 7 \nwith reactive dyes requires an average of 70 \u2013 150 litre water [1]. Various research works 8 \nhave been carried out on dye-house wastewater purification by Advanced Oxidation 9 \nProcess employing TiO2 catalyst under UV irradiation. The advantages of UV\/TiO2 10 \nprocess are manifold; it produces less residual pollutants compared to other conventional 11 \nprocesses and reduces the disposal cost, consequently water treatment cost [2]. Some 12 \nauthors investigated decolorization of textile effluent using ozone, which was found to be 13 \nhighly effective [3] AOP (UV\/TiO2) produces hydroxyl radical, which is able to oxidize a 14 \nrange of organic compounds significantly faster than ozone [4].  15 \nDecolorization of wastewater contaminated with RR198 was studied by Robert et. 16 \nal [5] in which TiO2 powder was used in colloidal form.  Result of this investigation 17 \nshowed that use of TiO2 powder in colloidal form was much more effective than the 18 \nimmobilized system because of higher available surface area. Various authors have 19 \ninvestigated adsorption of reactive dyes on different adsorbent like activated carbon [6], 20 \nfly ash [7], and chitosan\/oil palm ash composite beads [8] etc. Different synthesized and 21 \ncommercial acyclic ester resins were also used for dye adsorption efficiently [9]. All 22 \nthese studies confirm that the dye removal is possible by adsorption. 23 \nPage 3 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n3 \nBeside these, other processes like electrochemical process [10], 1 \ncoagulation\/flocculation process [11], and microbial decolorization [12] were studied by 2 \nresearchers. But the disposal of these spent adsorbents and final waste cause additional 3 \nenvironmental pollution. Hence, regeneration of spent adsorbent is the way to solve this 4 \ndisposal problem. Activated carbon adsorbent can be regenerated using some chemicals 5 \n(NaOH and HCl) [13].  6 \nWith reference to the previous investigations, we have emphasized the 7 \nregeneration of TiO2 catalyst without using any chemicals. Only UV irradiation has been 8 \nemployed to decompose adsorbed dye molecules by photocatalytic oxidation reaction. 9 \nWe also studied the possibility of recycling and reuse of TiO2 catalyst after regeneration. 10 \nTiO2 catalyst has been reused in five successive cycles and the result shows that TiO2 11 \ncatalyst can be recycled after regeneration. A kinetic model equation of photocatalytic 12 \nreaction has been developed considering deactivation of catalyst due to effect of 13 \nintermediate product and some inorganic ions [14] on the catalyst surface. Kinetic of 14 \ncatalyst deactivation also has been studied in this present work.  15 \n 16 \n2. Materials and methods  17 \nChemicals used for this study are, Reactive Red 198 (MW: 923 g.mol-1), which is 18 \na diazo dye (Fig.1). This dye was supplied from a dye-house near Kolkata, West Bengal, 19 \nIndia. TiO2 powder Hombikat UV \u2013 100 was used as catalyst. This catalyst was supplied 20 \nby Sachtleben Chemie GmbH. The catalyst contains 99 % of anatase with a specific 21 \nsurface area (BET) >250 m2.g-1 and primary crystal size < 10 nm dia. Water used for all 22 \nthese experiments is deionized water.   23 \nPage 4 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n4 \n2.1 Experimental setup 1 \nA Jar Tester manufactured by Phipps and Bird, Virginia, USA was used for 2 \nexperimental purpose. The Jar Tester comprising six jars with six stirrers (uniform 3 \nspeed). The volume of each jar is 1 litre. A UV illuminating bulb was placed on the top of 4 \nthese jars. Stirrers of this Jar Tester consist of 2 flat bladed rectangular paddles with an 5 \narea 1.9 \u00d7 10 -3 m2. A uniform speed of 150 rpm has been maintained by using a control 6 \npanel with digital display. The schematic diagram of the jar tester has been shown in Fig. 7 \n2.   8 \n 9 \n2.2 Experimental procedure  10 \nFirstly adsorption of dye was studied to ensure the decolorization by 11 \nphotocatalytic reaction on TiO2 surface, because the substances that are adsorbed strongly 12 \ndegrade faster [15]. A series of experiment were conducted to find the optimum pH and 13 \nTiO2 dose for adsorption. Dark adsorption test of dye on TiO2 surface was carried out in 14 \nthe Jar Tester. All of these experiments were conducted in presence of infrared light to 15 \nprevent any decolorization of dyes by photocatalytic reaction. This test was performed 16 \nwith six different TiO2 doses in between 1 g.L-1 and 5 g.L-1. This test was conducted at 17 \nthree different pH (pH: 3, 5.5, and 7) with an initial dye concentration 350 mg.L-1. The 18 \npH of the test solution (mixture of dye solution and TiO2 adsorbent) was controlled using 19 \n10 M HCl and 10 M NaOH solution. After starting the experimental run, samples were 20 \ncollected from the Jar Tester with time to time. Then the collected samples were filtered 21 \nusing 0.45 \u00b5m polyethersulfone microfiltration membranes (Pall, Gelman Laboratory, 22 \nMichigan) to separate the TiO2 particles. After filtration, the concentration of dye was 23 \nPage 5 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n5 \nmeasured using a spectrophotometer (Jenway 6505 UV\/Vis spectrophotometer; 1 \nDunmow, Essex, UK) at a wavelength \u03bbmax =516 nm.  2 \nAfter completing adsorption test, decolorization test of dyes was carried out in 3 \npresence of UV ray illumination. A UV light illuminating bulb (100 watt) was used for 4 \nthis purpose. Samples were collected and filtered as earlier and concentrations of dyes 5 \nwere measured using an UV- Vis spectrophotometer. The dye decolorization test was 6 \nalso conducted without TiO2 and only in presence of UV irradiation to verify if it is 7 \ncatalytic reaction. Viability of TiO2 recycling was tested after both adsorption and 8 \ndecolorization test. A five cycles experiment was performed with TiO2 catalyst and 9 \nRR198; the initial concentration of dye and catalyst was 350 m g.L-1 and 5 g.L-1 10 \nrespectively. TiO2 was filtered by 0.45 \u00b5m microfiltration membrane after each cycle and 11 \nreused to the next cycle.    12 \n 13 \n3. Kinetics of photo-decolorization of RR198 on TiO2 surface 14 \nIn presence of UV illumination and TiO2 in aqueous solution, the azo bond (-15 \nN=N-) of RR198 breaks down and produces some colorless intermediate product. Those 16 \ncolorless intermediates goes further oxidation to produce non-toxic final product.  17 \nWe consider the following reactions take place during photo-decolorization of reactive 18 \ndye. In presence of UV irradiation TiO2 in aqueous solution produces electrons (e-) and 19 \nholes (h+) as:      20 \nTiO2 + h\u03bd \n1k\uf0be\uf0be\uf0ae   e- + h+                                                            (1) 21 \nWhere h is Plank\u2019s constant and \u03bd is frequency of UV irradiation.  22 \nAgain some electrons and holes combine and produce heat 23 \nPage 6 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n6 \ne- + h+  \n2k\uf0be\uf0be\uf0ae   heat                                                                    (2) 1 \nThe intensity of UV irradiation was same through out the study, so the kinetic of Eq.

Results and Discussions 18 \n4.1 Dark Adsorption of RR198 on TiO2 surface 19 \nResults of this study show that adsorption capacity of RR198 on TiO2 catalyst 20 \nsurface is very high at acidic condition. The point of zero charge of TiO2 (pHpzc) is close 21 \nPage 9 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n9 \nto pH 6.8. At pH higher than 6.8 TiO2 surface becomes negatively charged according to 1 \nthe electrochemical equilibrium: 2 \nTiOH + OH- \uf0be\uf0be\uf0ae\uf0ac\uf0be  H2O + TiO\n-                                                           (24) 3 \nAnd at pH lower than 6.8 TiO2 surface becomes positively charged  4 \nTiOH + H+ \uf0be\uf0be\uf0ae\uf0ac\uf0be   Ti \u2013 OH2\n+                                                      (25) 5 \nRR198 (Fig.1) contains negatively charged sulfonate groups thus at acidic condition 6 \ninteraction between positively charged catalyst surface and negatively charged dyes favor 7 \nthe adsorption.  At any pH (pH 7) higher than pHpzc, the adsorption capacity is relatively 8 \nlow whereas adsorption capacity is high at pH (pH 3 and 5.5) lower than pHpzc; as shown 9 \nin Fig. 3.  10 \n Fig. 4 shows adsorption quantity vs time plot. This figure shows that most of 11 \nadsorption takes place within 20 minutes from the starting and equilibrium reaches after 1 12 \nhr.  13 \nFig. 5 represents the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms; values of 14 \nconstants are given in Table 1. It is clear from Table 1 that Langmuir isotherm fits 15 \nexperimental data better than the Freundlich isotherm. The value of dimensionless 16 \nseparation factor ( LR ) indicates that the Langmuir isotherm is of favorable type.    17 \nAccording to Freundlich Isotherm model equation 18 \n                                                 \n1\nFn\nF eQ k C\uf03d                            (26) 19 \nThe linear form of Freundlich Isotherm is  20 \n1ln ln lnF e\nF\nQ k C\nn\n\uf03d \uf02b                  (27) 21 \nPage 10 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n10 \nAccording to Langmuir isotherm  1 \n             1 1 1 1\neq L m eq mQ k Q C Q\n\uf03d \uf02b                         (28) 2 \nAnd dimensionless separation factor  3 \n0\n1\n1L L\nR\nk C\n\uf03d\n\uf02b\n                                                               (29) 4 \nAs the value of LR  is much lower than 1, adsorption is favorable type   5 \n 6 \n4.2 Photo-decolorization of RR198 on TiO2 catalyst 7 \nEq. (20) shows that rate of photo-decolorization depends on the adsorbed quantity 8 \nof dye on catalyst surface ([ ]adsDye ). Eq. (21) has been developed considering Langmuir 9 \nadsorption isotherm. Experimental data of photo-decolorization reaction have been fitted 10 \nto the Eq. (23) as shown in Fig. 6. Initially the activity of catalyst is 1, as we use fresh 11 \ncatalyst.  Fitting the experimental data for pH 3 (R2 = 0.991) the Eq. (23) becomes 12 \n\uf05b \uf05d\n\uf05b \uf05d0\nln 0.35\nDye\nt\nDye\n\uf03d \uf02d                            (30) 13 \nEq. (30) confirms that decolorization reaction follows L-H model at lower pH. The value 14 \nof Lk K\uf0a2  from the above equation is 0.35 min\n-1 or 20.98 hr.-1  The value of the constant LK  15 \n(= L mk Q ) is 106.304 L.g,\n-1 so the calculated value of  k\uf0a2  is 0.197 g.L.-1hr-1   16 \n 17 \n4.3 Recycling of TiO2 catalyst 18 \nFig. 7 describes the dye concentration ratio vs. time (hr) plot during catalyst 19 \nrecycling experiment. The subsequent cycles are taking longer time than the preceding 20 \none, because the activity of catalyst decreases due to poising. RR198 contains sulfonate 21 \nPage 11 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n11 \ngroup so there must be inorganic sulfate ion in final solution; this sulfate ions even at low 1 \nconcentration reduce the oxidation rate [14]. 2 \n  3 \n4.4 Calculation of catalyst activity for successive cycles 4 \nExperimental results show that recycling of catalyst is possible after regeneration. 5 \nIncomplete oxidation of dye causes catalyst poisoning due to presence of intermediate 6 \nproduct. The calculated value of initial rate of reaction ( 0ir ) and catalyst activity ( a ) for 7 \neach cycle have given in Table 2.  8 \nWe consider 1st order decay of catalyst activity, and we have the equation 9 \n0\ncdk ta a e \uf02d\uf03d                              (31) 10 \nWhere cdk  is catalyst deactivation co-efficient. Fitting the value of catalyst activity 11 \nagainst starting time of each cycle (R2 = 0.975) from Table 2 we get 12 \n0.10341.02 ta e\uf02d\uf03d                        (32) 13 \nThe activity of catalyst at any time can be calculated from Eq. (32). The value of catalyst 14 \ndeactivation co-efficient ( cdk ) is 0.1034 hr\n-1 15 \nPage 12 of 27\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n \n \n12 \n5. Conclusion  1 \nThe present study shows that TiO2 adsorbs RR198 effectively at acidic condition 2 \n(pH 3) and adsorption follows Langmuir isotherm (R2 = 0.99) better than Freundlich 3 \nisotherm (R2 = 0.96). Regeneration of spent adsorbent is possible by oxidizing the dye 4 \nmolecules via a photo-decolorization reaction using UV illumination. Photo-5 \ndecolorization reaction follows the L-H kinetics (R2 = 0.99). This study shows that 6 \nrecycling of catalyst is also possible after regeneration. The activity of catalyst decreases 7 \ndue to poising and deactivation which follows first order kinetics.    8 \n 9 \nAcknowledgements 10 \nA part of this study was carried out at Centre for Water Science (Formerly School 11 \nof Water Sciences), Cranfield University, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, MK43 OAL, UK 12 \nunder British Council Higher Education Link Programme.
