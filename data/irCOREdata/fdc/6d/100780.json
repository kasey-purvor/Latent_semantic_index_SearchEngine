It is important, therefore, in designing and fab-\nricating field emission displays or future cold cathode\nsources, to understand fully the emission properties and char-\nacteristics of not just arrays and mats of CNT, but of indi-\nvidual CNTs. To date, various studies have been performed\non field emission from a single CNT.11\u201313 Measurements of\nfield emission often attempts to quantify the behavior in\nterms of the applied electric field and the local electric field\nat the tip, via \u0002. For an emitter not operating in the high\ncurrent space charge regime, the local electric field required\nfor emission should not be a function of the electrode sepa-\nration, D, and one would expect that measurements of the\napplied threshold field not to be dependent on the relative\nseparation of the electrodes, with the applied electric field\ngiven simply as V \/D, where V is the applied potential dif-\nference. In this letter, we report that the position of the anode\nelectrode in field emission from a single CNT is important,\nand furthermore that redefining the manner in which the ap-\nplied field is described gives rise to a better understanding of\nthe CNTs field emission properties.\nMultiwalled carbon nanotubes were synthesized by a\nplasma arc discharge between two graphite electrodes.

It\nis worth noting that during SEM imaging neither the CNT\nnor the polymer exhibit any charging, which suggests they\nare both conductive.\nField emission \u0001FE\u0002 experimentation was performed in a\nmodified Cambridge Stereoscan 250 III SEM that includes\nelectrical feed throughs connected to a sharp tungsten tip \u0001FE\nanode\u0002 and the CNT substrate. The tip can be moved inde-\npendently of the SEM stage by three-axis piezoslides with a\nminimum step size of 40 nm and up to 5 mm travel, see Fig.\n1. A FE testing system, comprising of a Labview program\nrunning a Keithley 237 source meter, was then connected to\nthe FE stage and anode, to measure field emission character-\nistics with a 100 fA resolution.\nFE testing was conducted within the SEM chamber at a\nvacuum of better than 10\u22125 Torr. The sample was mounted\non the isolated FE stage with silver epoxy and FE was per-\nformed at CNT tip to anode separations of 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 40,\nand 60 \u0001m and due to the experiments being conducted in\nthe SEM, these separations could be established very accu-\nrately. The FE voltage cycling and current\/voltage measure-\nments were computer controlled to ensure repeatability of\nthe testing procedure. The applied voltage was increased in\n0.5 V steps \u0001smoothed by a RC circuit\u0002 until an emission\ncurrent of 1 \u0001A was measured and then the voltage was\nreduced to 0 V in similar steps. A limit of 1 \u0001A was em-\nployed to ensure that damage to the single CNT due to fila-\nment current heating was not a possibility. Emission current\nwas plotted against applied electric field for each of the CNT\ntip-anode separations. The resulting plots are shown in Fig.\n2\u0001a\u0002. It can be seen that for a CNT to anode separation of\n1 \u0001m, the threshold field, ET, defined here as the applied\nfield required for an emission of 100 nA, is 42 V \u0001m\u22121. As\nthe separation is increased to 2 \u0001m, the threshold field re-\nduces to 27 V \u0001m\u22121. Subsequent increasing of the separation\nto 4, 10, 20, 40, and 60 \u0001m \u000160 \u0001m being the largest as\nbeyond this, accurate measurement of the distance became\ndifficult as the CNT was no longer resolved at that magnifi-\ncation\u0002 gave threshold fields of 19, 10, 7, 5, and 4 V \u0001m\u22121,\nrespectively. Figure 2\u0001b\u0002 shows 1\/E against ln\u0001I \/E2\u0002 Fowler-\nNordheim plots for the seven CNT tip to anode separations\nlisted earlier. All plots are approximately a straight line indi-\ncating that the emission mechanism is likely to be of the\nFowler-Nordheim Fermi level tunneling type. A plot of\nthreshold field for an emission current of 100 nA against\nCNT to anode separation is shown in Fig. 3, where it is\nobserved that the threshold reduces asymptotically. This can\nbe explained by the fact that as the anode approaches the tip\nof the CNT, the tip to anode approximates a parallel plate\nconfiguration and the geometric field enhancement factor of\nthe CNT decreases. As the anode electrode is moved away\nfrom the CNT tip, the parallel plate approximation dimin-\nishes and the geometric properties of the CNT reduce the\nthreshold field required by its field enhancement. A plot of\nthe enhancement factor which was extrapolated from the\nFowler-Nordheim equation using a work function of 4.5 eV\nis also shown in Fig. 3. Enhancement is seen to reduce as the\nanode approaches the tip of the CNT, further suggesting that\nthe system approximates to a parallel plate configuration at\nlow D, and at higher values of D, enhancement is seen to\nlevel out in accordance to the threshold field. From this we\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132. Redistribution subject tocan deduce that at high D, the enhancement factor is depen-\ndant on the geometrical properties of the CNT alone and not\nthe location of the anode, as enhancement reaches an\nasymptotic value. But at low D the enhancement factor of the\nsingle CNT is dependant on its geometrical properties and\nthe location of the anode electrode. Using the two-\ndimensional theoretically obtained expression from Ref. 16,\nfor electric field enhancement factor of a single, isolated\nCNT, where the anode electrode is sufficiently far away, we\ncan now fit to this expression based on three-dimensional\nFIG. 2. \u0001a\u0002 Emission current against applied electric field for anode to CNT\ntip separations of 1 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 2 \u0001\u0002\u0002, 4 \u0001\u0001\u0002, 10 \u0001\u0002\u0002, 20 \u0001\u0003\u0002, 40 \u0001\u0004\u0002, and 60 \u0001m\n\u0001 \u0002.

The enhancement fac-\ntor is seen to be 807, which is the value that the enhancement\nfactor approaches from our data of Fig. 3 as D increases and\nis denoted by the dotted line in Fig. 3. While the trends of\nthreshold field and enhancement factor of Fig. 3 are in con-\ntradiction to other reported work of field emission from\nsingle CNT,17 we feel that the manner in which we are de-\nfining the applied electric field as anode to CNT tip, rather\nthan the more commonly used anode to cathode \u0001or CNT\nbase\/substrate\u0002 is more applicable and gives a more realistic\ninsight into the field emission properties of emission from a\nsingle CNT. The derivation of this empirical fit to the field\nwhen D is greater than three times the height of the tube is to\nbe explored in future work. As the Fowler-Nordheim analy-\nsis of Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 showed approximations to a straight line, it\nwas possible for an emission current to be calculated using\nthe well known and widely accepted Fowler-Nordheim\nequation18\nI =\naA\u00022E2\n\u0005\nexp\u0006\u2212 b\u00053\/2\n\u0002E \u0007 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere a and b are constants with values 1.54\n\u000610\u22126 A eV V\u22122 and 6.83\u0006107 eV3\/2 V cm\u22121, respectively.\nA is the emission area which has been calculated as 5\n\u000610\u221213 cm\u22122 using the CNT radius of 40 nm. \u0002 is the en-\nhancement factor which was taken from the data of Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002.\nE is the applied electric field in V cm\u22121 and \u0005 is the work\nfunction which was estimated at 4.5 eV. Figure 4\u0001a\u0002 shows\nthe I-E curves for the seven values of D and Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002 is the\nextracted threshold field for an emission current of 100 nA\nand the threshold fields found experimentally and shown in\nFig. 3. It can be seen that the obtained trends and values of\nFig. 4\u0001a\u0002 are comparable to that of Fig. 2\u0001a\u0002 and that the\ncalculated threshold fields are a close match to that found\nexperimentally.\nIn conclusion, we have shown electron field emission\nfrom a single isolated CNT in a modified SEM. Accurate\nanode to CNT tip separations down to 1 \u0001m were made\npossible by manipulating the anode electrode and sample\nstage within the SEM. We have shown that as the separation\nof the CNT to anode increases from 1 to 60 \u0001m, the thresh-\nold field decreases to an asymptotic value dependant on the\ngeometric properties of the CNT, and the enhancement factor\nincreases to an asymptotic value in accordance with the de-\ncreasing threshold field. This is due to the CNT tip and anode\napproximating a parallel plate at low D.\nThe authors would like to thank the EPSRC Portfolio\nPartnership and Carbon Based Electronics programmes for\nfunding this research.\n1S.
