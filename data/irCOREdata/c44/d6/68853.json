INTRODUCTION\nUntil recently\u2014but for a few exceptions\u2014the study of quantum dot (QD) heterostruc-\ntures with the staggered (type-II) band alignment had been largely ignored because of the\nabsence of confinement of one of the two types of carriers and their presumed poor radia-\ntive efficiency. However, it has come to be recognized that these structures are interesting,\nespecially for their rich physics of excitons.1\u20137\nIn contrast to the usual type-I QDs (e.g. InAs\/GaAs) where the confinement energy scale\nis far greater than the energy of the Coulomb interaction, the role of confinement in type-II\nQDs is largely limited to defining the geometry of the system. This in itself has interesting\nconsequences. The multiply-connected topology can give rise to an oscillatory ground state\nenergy for the magneto-excitons.1,2 Secondly, type-II QDs also act as nanocapacitors8 which\nselectively accommodate only one type of particles; but once charged they can bind the\ncomplementary particle to form an exciton. The strength of the Coulomb interaction can be\nmodified by screening or magnetic field.4 At higher excitation powers, they can be doubly-\ncharged and form four-particle bound states (biexcitons). The biexcitons in a type-II QD\nsystem are very unlike their counterparts9 in type-I QDs and quantum wells. They always\nhave negative \u2018binding energy\u2019.6 In the atomic physics language, while the usual biexciton\nis structurally analogous to a hydrogen molecule, the biexciton6 in type-II QDs is more like\na helium atom.5\nIn this article we have probed the nature of the ensemble photoluminescence (PL) emis-\nsion from a sample with InP QDs in a GaAs matrix. Although the band offsets10 of bulk InP\nand GaAs and some previous studies suggest that this material combination forms type-II\nstructures with electrons localized within the InP quantum dots and free holes in the GaAs\nmatrix, the energy gap of InP and GaAs is within 100meV of each other, and the conduction\nband offset is relatively small.10 Thus alloying and anisotropic strain within the QDs,11 can\nmodify the energy gap and the relative offsets in way that is dependent on the details of\nthe size and shape of the QDs. For example, a comprehensive k.p calculation10 does not\nfind a type-II alignment in this system. Secondly, thick (> 100 nm) InP heteroepitaxial\nlayers on GaAs and even homoepitaxial InP have shown a broad emission peak at 1.34 eV12\ndue to donor-acceptor-pair (DA) recombination, which is rather close to the PL energy of\nInP\/GaAs QDs. Furthermore, the DA emission has characteristics13 generally used to clas-\n2\nsify spatially-indirect excitons from type-II QDs\u2014excitation power-dependent blue-shift,3,14\nspectrally broad emission at a sub-bandgap energy in macro-PL, and narrow emission lines\nfrom localized states in micro-PL.3 One of the aims of this study is to unambiguously es-\ntablish the type-II band alignment in this system and highlight the role of heterostructure\nboundary conditions on the size and the binding energy of excitons. In this work we will\nnot discuss the Aharonov-Bohm-type effects associated with the topology of the wave func-\ntion as these have already been extensively discussed in literature1,2 and manifest on energy\nscales an order of magnitude smaller than we are interested in here.\nSecondly, by extending the measurements to over six orders of magnitude of excitation\npowers, we have been able to change the average electronic occupancy within the QDs.\nThis leads to significant changes in the diamagnetic shift coefficient that are a result of the\ninteresting physics of biexcitons.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\nThe sample was grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy on (001) GaAs substrate.11\nThe QD density was about 3 \u00d7 1010cm\u22122 with an average diameter of 32 nm (\u00b16 nm) and\naverage height of about 4 nm (\u00b12 nm) as measured by cross-sectional transmission electron\nmicroscopy.11 But based on experience from other heterostructures, it is possible that the\nactual size of quantum dots is much smaller.15\nNon-resonant (excitation wavelength=532nm) PL measurements were performed at liquid\nhelium temperature with the excitation powers varied between (\u223c 10\u22124\u2212 100Wcm\u22122). The\nlight from the excitation laser and the sample PL was fibre-optically coupled in and out of (i)\na variable-temperature cryostat within the bore of a superconducting magnet (B\u2264 12T ) for\nmagneto-PL measurements at low excitation powers and (ii) a liquid helium bath cryostat\nwhose tail was within the 18mm bore of the pulsed field coil (B \u2264 50T ) for measurements\nat higher powers P > 30Wcm\u22122. The PL spectra were recorded by an electron multiply-\ning charged-coupled device after being dispersed by a 30cm imaging spectrograph. Pulsed\nmagnetic fields of up to 50 T were generated using a 5 kV, 500 kJ capacitor bank. The field\nhad a duration of about 20ms, during which several PL spectra were recorded. Fig. 1(inset)\nshows three representative spectra under different conditions.\n3\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\n1.334\n1.336\n1.338\n1.340\n1.342\n1.32 1.36 1.40 1.44\n \n \nPL\n p\nea\nk \nen\ner\ngy\n (e\nV)\nMagnetic field (T)\nEB\nBc=5.9T\n \nY\n4.2KZ2Z1\n \nEnergy (eV)\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (Inset) Three representative spectra from the InP\/GaAs QD ensemble taken\nunder different conditions.

Excitons: Type-II band alignment\nFig.1 shows the magnetic field-dependent PL peak-shift measured at 4.2K, at a very low\nexcitation power of about 10\u22124Wcm\u22122. Using the model of a hydrogenic exciton, one can\nsemi-phenomenologically describe this shift by the following equations:4,5\nE(B) = E0 +\nq2\u3008\u03c12x\u3009\n8\u00b5\nB2, forB < Bc (1a)\nE(B) = E0 \u2212 ~\n2\n2\u00b5\u3008\u03c12x\u3009\n+\n~q\n2\u00b5\nB, forB > Bc (1b)\nThese equations are derived under the assumption that the magnetic field-induced change\nin the ground state energy of a hydrogenic exciton from the low-field regime of quadratic\n4\n(diamagnetic) shift to the high field linear shift (due to transitions between effectively free\nLandau levels) is adiabatically continuous (i.e. its functional form is continuous and differ-\nentiable) between two well-defined limits. Note that the high field limitis approximate as it\nassumes that the transitions are between free Landau levels and ignores the weak (log 2B,\nas B \u2192 \u221e) dependence16 of the excitonic binding energy on magnetic field. Here E0 is\nthe ground state energy without the magnetic field. Bc = 2~\/(q\u3008\u03c12x\u3009) corresponds to the\nmagnetic field when 2l2B = \u3008\u03c12x\u3009. \u03c1x is the excitonic Bohr radius, lB is the magnetic length,\n\u00b5 is the reduced effective mass and q the magnitude of the electronic charge. The fit to\nEq.1, along with its physical content, is also shown in Fig.1. The second term in Eq.1(b)\ncorresponds to the excitonic binding energy and is the extrapolation of the high-field slope\n[third term in Eq.1(b)] to B = 0.17 The crossover from quadratic to linear slope is found\nat 5.9T. The values of the exciton radius, the binding energy and the diamagnetic shift\ncoefficient are given in Table 1.\nTable 1 also compares the effect of the heterostructure boundary conditions on the ex-\ncitonic parameters in InP. Note the systematic trend in the value of the diamagnetic shift\ncoefficient. The effective electron-hole interaction in type-II dots is the weakest followed by\nbulk InP, and then finally InP\/GaxIn1\u2212xP QDs which show a much stronger binding [also\nsee Fig.2]. Thus, on physical grounds, the observations are most consistent with type-II\nband alignment.\nNext, we will explore the multi-particle states in these QDs by excitation-power-\ndependent PL measurements. These measurements will also help us rule out DA recom-\nTABLE I: Comparison of exciton parameters in InP under different boundary conditions\nDiamag. shift Bohr radius Binding energy\n\u0393 (\u00b5eV T\u22122)\n\u221a\u3008\u03c12\u3009 (nm) EB (meV)\nInP\/GaAs QDa 42.4\u00b1 0.5 15.0\u00b1 0.1 1.5\u00b1 0.1\nBulk InP 40 [19] \u223c 12 b 4.8\u00b1 0.2 [20]\nInP\/GaInP QD 2-5 [21,22] 2.7\u2212 4.3 b \u2014c\naThis work\nbEstimated from the diamagnetic shift in the first column using electron mass of InP, \u00b5 = 0.08m0\ncAvailable magnetic field was not large enough21 to reach B > Bc [cf. equation 1(b)]\n5\nbination, as will be discussed in section III C. In what follows, we will assume that the QDs\nhave type-II alignment.\nB. Biexcitons\nThe PL peak position, measured without the magnetic field [Fig.3(b)] is strongly excita-\ntion power-dependent beyond an incident laser intensity of about 10\u22121 W-cm\u22122. This marks\nthe point where multiparticle states start to play a role in PL. The observed blue-shift is due\nthe additional energy associated with the capacitive charging of the QDs. The integrated\nPL intensity (not shown here for brevity) also gradually changes its slope from linear to\n(slightly) superlinear beyond 10\u22121 W-cm\u22122, indicating that a fraction of emission is from\nbiexcitonic states.\nThe dependence of the PL peak position as a function of the magnetic field at different\nexcitation powers, measured over almost six orders of magnitude, is shown in Fig.3(a).\nNotice that the curves are all qualitatively similar and that they all can be fitted to equations\n1 [solid lines in Fig3(a)]. This is because the B-dependent change in the energy of biexcitonic\nlevels is just the sum of single particle energies, but with the important difference that the\nbiexcitonic radius \u03c1xx and hence the diamagnetic shift coefficient are significantly different.\n+-\nBulk\nB+-\nType-I\nA B\n+-\nType-II\nC\nB\n+\n- -\n+\n-\n+Z\nE A C\nB B B\nCA\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Schematic depiction of an exciton in bulk material, and heterostructured\nQDs with type-I and type-II band alignment.

Type-I confinement results in a decrease in the exciton radius and an increase in\nthe exciton binding energy. For QDs with type-II band alignment, the exciton binding should be\nweaker and the radius larger compared to the bulk InP values and the emission energy can be\nsmaller than the bandgaps of either of the two materials.\n6\nHowever, for an ensemble, the analysis is thus complicated by the facts that (i) the\nemission is from a mixture of excitonic and biexcitonic states with an unknown biexciton\nfraction \u03b1, (ii) when a photon is emitted by a biexciton, what is measured in the magneto-\nPL experiment is the difference in the shifts of biexcitonic and excitonic levels, because the\nemission process involves biexciton \u2192 exciton + photon.

(2)\nThe diamagnetic shift coefficient \u0393 is thus expected to be strongly excitation-power-\ndependent. Indeed this is observed in Fig.3(c). \u0393 changes by factor of two due to the\nmuch smaller biexcitonic radius. Recall that in type-I QDs, confinement usually renders\nthe diamagnetic shift independent of the charge in the dot.9 In general, it depends on the\nrelative extents of the spatial spread of the electron and the hole wave functions.\nFor a rough estimate of the biexciton fraction as a function of excitation power, we\nuse the ratio of the Bohr radii for the helium and the hydrogen atom, \u03c1He\/\u03c1H \u2248 0.6.23\nFig.3(d) is plotted using this value of \u03c1xx\/\u03c1x and we find that the biexciton fraction at the\nhighest excitation power is about 30%. Also note that when \u3008\u03c12xx\u3009\/\u3008\u03c12x\u3009 < 0.5, equation\n2 predicts that the observed diamagnetic shift coefficient would not only reduce but also\nbecome negative at very high excitation powers.\nThe strong dependence of the diamagnetic shift coefficient on the excitation power also\nexplains the anomalous results of Godoy, et al.18, who found the excitonic diameter to\nbe smaller in InP\/GaAs compared to the bulk InP. They measured a diamagnetic shift\ncoefficient of between 5\u201320\u00b5eV T\u22122, the latter of which is equal to what we measure at the\nhighest excitation power.\nFig.3(e) shows that the exciton mass (high field slope of the curves in Fig.3(a)) stays\nat approximately 0.1me, constant within 15% over the whole range of excitation powers.\nHence the changes in the diamagnetic shift coefficient can be understood as being largely\nthe difference in the excitonic and biexcitonic radii (equation 2). This provides consistency\nto the analysis. The value of the mass is between the free electron mass in InP (0.08me)\nand the free heavy-hole in GaAs (0.45me). This is reasonable because the electron is largely\nimmobilized by the quantum dot. Strain and non-parabolicity effects may further contribute\nto the enhancement of the electron mass.\nC. Donor-Acceptor-pair(DA)-recombination hypothesis\nThe excitation power dependence of the diamagnetic shift coefficient [Fig.3(c)] also rules\nout recombination due to overlap between donor and acceptor wave functions. DA recom-\n8\nbination has an energy24\n~\u03c9DA = Eg \u2212 EbD0 \u2212 EbA0 +\ne2\n4pi\u00b20\u00b2rDA\n\u2212m~\u03c9LO (3)\nEg is the energy gap, E\nb\nD0 and E\nb\nA0 are the binding energies of the donor and acceptor levels,\nthe fourth term is the Coulomb repulsion energy of the ionized centres after recombination,\nand m~\u03c9LO are the phonon-assisted transitions.24 While the DA-pair emission shares some\ncharacteristics with emission from type-II QDs such as the diamagnetic shifts from DA-\nrecombination would be of the same order as for excitons [Fig.1] and at higher excitation\npowers there would be a blue-shift24 qualitatively similar to that seen in Fig.3(b), the dia-\nmagnetic shift coefficient itself should not have an excitation power dependence as observed\nin Fig.3(c). Secondly one should expect a strong quenching of the PL intensity in magnetic\nfield for DA recombination\u2014the wavefunctions shrink in the magnetic field and since the\nelectron and hole centres are not at the same point in space, their (exponentially small)\noverlap will be strongly reduced. This is also not observed.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe studied the PL from InP\/GaAs QD heterostructures in very high magnetic fields (B \u2264\n50T ) over almost six orders of magnitude of excitation powers. Magneto-PL measurements\nat very low excitation powers established that the excitons have an average Bohr radius of\n15nm and a binding energy of 1.5meV. These values indicate a much weaker binding for the\nexcitons in comparison with bulk InP and provide strong evidence for type-II band alignment\nin these QDs. We also studied the evolution of the electron-hole binding as the QD ensemble\nmakes a gradual transition from a regime where the emission is from (hydrogen-like) two-\nparticle excitonic states, to a regime where the emission from (helium-like) four-particle\nbiexcitonic states also becomes significant. This was demonstrated by a strong variation of\nthe diamagnetic shift with the excitation power.\nV.
