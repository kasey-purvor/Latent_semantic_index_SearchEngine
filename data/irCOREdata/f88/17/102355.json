INTRODUCTION\nE FFECTIVE resource management can provision qualityof service (QoS) for network users and increase revenue\nfor network operators. A typical resource management policy\nconsists of three main elements: 1) access control to regulate\nthe incoming traffic; 2) admission control to avoid system\noverload; and 3) dynamic resource allocation to efficiently\nshare the system resources among admitted users. Scheduling\nis an effective technique for dynamic resource allocation in\ndelay tolerant systems in order to achieve fairness and efficient\nutilization of network resources. Designing efficient scheduling\nschemes has been extensively investigated for wired networks\n[1]. However, due to the significantly different characteristics\nof wireless channels, the scheduling schemes perform poorly in\nwireless networks [2]. Since the quality of a wireless channel is\na random process, and its statistical characteristics depend on\nthe location of a mobile user, efficient utilization of bandwidth\nwhile maintaining fairness among users is a very challenging\nproblem.\nManuscript received August 16, 2005; revised April 3, 2006 and July 9, 2006.\nThis work was supported by a research grant from Bell University Laboratories\nunder the sponsorship of Bell Canada and the Natural Sciences and Engineering\nResearch Council of Canada. The review of this paper was coordinated by\nProf. T. Hou.\nThe authors are with the Centre for Wireless Communications, Department\nof Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo,\nON N2L 3G1, Canada (e-mails: mdianati@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca; xshen@bbcr.\nuwaterloo.ca; knaik@bbcr.uwaterloo.ca).\nColor versions of one or more of the figures in this paper are available online\nat http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org.\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TVT.2007.897209\nIt has been demonstrated that diversity techniques provide\neffective solutions to mitigate the negative impacts of random\nchannel fluctuations in wireless networks [3]. In cellular net-\nworks, the existence of multiple base stations (BSs) naturally\nprovides a dimension of space diversity, which is referred to\nas the BS diversity throughout this paper. BS diversity has\nbeen applied to soft handoff in IS-95 code division multiple\naccess (CDMA) cellular networks to increase the reliability of\ncommunications for the users near cell boundaries, where there\nare many simultaneous voice transmissions. For nonreal-time\ndata traffic, simultaneous transmissions are not necessary. If\ncertain delay can be tolerated, transmissions can be scheduled.\nAn efficient scheduling technique is to prioritize transmission to\ndifferent users based on quality of their channels. This can be\nconsidered as an opportunistic service discipline. Opportunistic\nscheduling can be combined with BS diversity in a selection\nmanner to improve bandwidth utilization. If the partial channel\nstate information (CSI) from several BSs to a group of users is\navailable in every scheduling epoch (i.e., time slot), a scheduler\ncan coordinate transmissions from those BSs. Furthermore,\ntransmission power of the coordinated BSs can be optimized\nto improve system throughput. This can be considered as a co-\noperative scheduling scheme, which increases system through-\nput by 1) reducing interference among the adjacent BSs and\n2) improving multiuser diversity gain.\nIn this paper, we consider scheduling for the downlink of\nCDMA cellular network. Downlink is the primary focus, since\ndata traffic is expected to be heavier for the downlink than\nthe uplink. Thus, efficient scheduling for the downlink can\nsignificantly improve the revenue of a network operator. We\npropose a cooperative utility fair scheduling (CUFS) scheme,\nwhere the coverage area of the cellular network is divided\ninto many cells, and each cell is covered by a group of three\nmost interfering sector antennas (SAs) from three adjacent BSs.\nThere is one scheduler in each group. The scheduler imple-\nments a utility-fair [4] selection mechanism in order to select\nthree users from three adjacent cells for transmission in each\ntime slot. The user selection mechanism maintains the long\nterm fairness among users. In addition, the mechanism defines a\nparameter to balance long term fairness and service smoothness\nallowing a network operator to utilize its bandwidth efficiently.\nAn optimal power allocation scheme is introduced to minimize\ninterference among three coordinated SAs, thereby maximizing\nthe sum of instantaneous transmission rates from a group of\nadjacent SAs, which is called a cooperation group.

The contributions of this paper are\nthreefold.\n1) A utility-fair user selection mechanism is proposed to\nmaintain long-term fairness among users and provide\na flexible mechanism to control smoothness of service\naccording to the QoS requirements of users.\n2) An optimal power allocation scheme is proposed to mini-\nmize interference among coordinated SAs belonging to a\ncooperation group.\n3) It is demonstrated that multiuser diversity gain can be\nimproved by cooperative scheduling.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II,\nwe discuss related works. We specify our system model in\nSection III. In Section IV, we propose the cooperative fair\nscheduling scheme. Simulation results are given in Section V,\nfollowed by the conclusions in Section VI, respectively.\nII. RELATED WORKS\nIn general, wireless scheduling schemes can be divided into\ntwo categories: 1) scheduling schemes for fixed transmission\nrate BSs and 2) scheduling schemes for dynamic transmission-\nrate BSs. For the fixed transmission rate, it is assumed that there\nis a power control mechanism such that a BS can transmit to\nall users with a fixed transmission rate. Since power control\ncannot compensate for channel attenuation during deep fading,\na channel monitoring mechanism is usually employed by the\nscheduler to account for bad channel conditions. If the channel\nquality for a particular user is below a certain threshold, the\nscheduler defers transmitting to the user until its channel recov-\ners back to a normal condition. Due to location dependence of\nwireless channels, some users may experience a bad channel\ncondition more often than other users. Thus, to maintain some\ndegree of fairness among users, a compensation mechanism is\nusually implemented. Some well-known scheduling schemes\nfor the fixed transmission rate BSs are the following: 1) chan-\nnel state dependent packet scheduling [5]; 2) idealized wire-\nless fair queuing; and 3) Channel-condition Independent Fair\nQueuing. A survey of this type of scheduling schemes can be\nfound in [2].\nIn dynamic transmission-rate systems, BS always transmits\nat its maximum allowable power. However, the transmission\nrate is adapted according to the instantaneous quality of chan-\nnels for different users. In fact, transmitting at a fixed rate for\nall users is neither possible nor optimal. An optimal scheduling\nstrategy to maximize the total system throughput is to transmit\nto only one user with the best channel quality at the maximum\nachievable rate in each time slot [6], [7]. This scheduling\nstrategy can be considered as an opportunistic service discipline\nwhich has been used in several existing scheduling schemes\nsuch as the proportional fair scheduling (PFS) [4]. Although\nopportunistic service discipline maximizes the total bandwidth\nutilization, it is extremely unfair when the temporal and prob-\nabilistic characteristics of the channels from a BS to different\nMSs are not identical. Users with a relatively better average\nchannel quality enjoy higher average transmission rates than\nthose with a relatively poor average channel quality. Therefore,\na fairness enforcement mechanism is necessary.\nFor a scheduler with an opportunistic service discipline,\nthe higher is the number of users, the higher is the system\nthroughput. This property is know as multiuser diversity gain\n[9]. The achievable gain of an opportunistic scheduler is higher\nwhen the dynamic range of channel fluctuations is larger. A\nmultiple antenna transmission scheme, namely opportunistic\nbeam-forming, is proposed in [9] to enrich the dynamic range\nof channel fluctuations. The scheme is to split the transmission\npower among multiple transmit antennas, where each antenna\nis assigned a random proportion of the total transmission\npower. The proportion of the power and the transmitted signal\nphase for each antenna can be dynamically adjusted to induce\nconstructive and destructive addition of signals from different\nantennas at the receiver. This scheme can improve multiuser\ndiversity gain if the users are fixed or if the mobility of users\nis very low. However, it is less effective for the independent\nRayleigh fading environment, where transmit antennas are suf-\nficiently apart. Furthermore, the rates of artificially induced\nrandom variations of signal power and phase from different\nantennas have to be fast enough to induce appropriate artificial\nfading. On the other hand, the random variations need to be\nslow enough to ensure the accuracy of channel estimation\nfor proper operation of the scheduler. Our proposed scheme\ncan enhance the channel fluctuations to increase multiuser\ndiversity gain. However, unlike [9], we do not use artificially\ninduced fluctuations. Instead, we employ BS selection diver-\nsity to enrich channel fluctuations and increase the effec-\ntive number of users for the single scheduler by cooperative\nscheduling.\nOpportunistic scheduling for multiple-input and multiple-\noutput (MIMO) systems has been studied in [10]. It is con-\ncluded that in MIMO systems, the multiuser diversity gain\ndeclines as the number of antennas increases in the absence\nof the partial CSI at transmitter side. As we will demonstrate\nin this paper, selection diversity using partial CSI increases\nmultiuser diversity gain. Resource allocation and scheduling\nin multiple antenna systems have also been studied in [11]\nand [12]. However, the issue of fair scheduling is not properly\naddressed.\nIII. SYSTEM MODEL\nWe consider the downlink of a CDMA cellular network,\nconnected to the Internet backbone through a gateway, as\nshown in Fig. 1. The incoming data from the Internet back-\nbone is routed through the gateway to the corresponding BS\ncontroller (BSC)\/radio network controller (RNC), depending\non the location of the end users. Each BSC controls multiple\nBSs and each BS has three SAs. The SAs are directional\nantennas, as shown in Fig. 2, roughly covering a 120\u25e6 sector\nof a single cell. A cooperation group consists of three SAs\nassociated with a single scheduler, and the three SAs belong\nto three adjacent BSs. Each scheduler is part of a resource\nmanagement module which resides in the BSC\/RNC, as shown\nin Fig. 3. Besides the scheduling unit, the resource management\nmodule includes additional units: 1) an access control unit to\nregulate the incoming traffic; 2) a call admission control unit\nto manage call level activities; and 3) data buffers to separately\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Network model.\nFig. 2. Sector antennas.\nbuffer the incoming data for the admitted users. The resource\nmanagement unit interacts with the radio unit, which is the\nair interface of a cellular system. It is a two-way interaction\nto transmit data and acquire the partial CSI of the admitted\nusers. The scheduling unit comprises subunits for channel mon-\nitoring, QoS provisioning, queue monitoring, and transmission\nscheduling. The channel monitoring unit communicates with\nthe radio unit to collect and store feedback information from\nusers, including the estimation of channel quality from three\ndifferent SAs associated with a single scheduler. The queue\nmonitoring subsystem overlooks the queue accumulations to\nadjust users service rates if necessary. The QoS provisioning\nunit interacts with the call admission unit to allocate proper\nshare of the wireless channel bandwidth to users according to\nrequirements the users and the service contracts.\nThe air interface can support several key features as follows.\nAdaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) with higher order\nmodulation of QPSK, 8PSK, and 16 QAM enables multirate\ntransmission. The BS has a basic scheduling granularity of\n1.25-ms time slots. There is a forward packet data control chan-\nnel to carry user\u2019s MAC ID, packet size, and other necessary\ninformation for proper reception of the transmitted data packets.\nA reverse channel quality indicator channel (R-CQICH) is used\nby the MSs to report back the channel quality measurements\nfrom three serving SAs, belonging to three adjacent BSs. A fast\ncell selection mechanism enables dynamic assignment of the\nserving SA within a cooperation group. In our system model,\nsimultaneous transmissions from different SAs are separated\nby CDMA. However, each SA implements TDMA scheme\nto transmit to different users. Hybrid TDMA\/CDMA allows\nsimultaneous transmissions from several SAs to an arbitrary\nnumber of users. The system specifications are supported in\nthe new generation of cellular systems, such as cdma2000\n1 \u00d7 EV-DV [13] and High-Speed Downlink Packet Access\n(HSDPA) [14].\nIV. COOPERATIVE FAIR SCHEDULING SCHEMES\nIn this section, we formulate fair scheduling as an optimiza-\ntion problem, propose the CUFS scheme, develop a flexible\nfairness enforcement mechanism to improve service smooth-\nness of the CUFS scheme, and investigate the impacts of\ncooperative scheduling on multiuser diversity gain.\nA. Problem Formulation\nOur objective is to maximize the sum of long term throughput\nof the three SAs. The constraints are fairness and total allowed\npower budget of the three SAs. Let mj(t) be the index of the\nserving SA of user j in time slot t. Denote by pmj(t),j(t) the\nallocated transmission power from the SAmj(t) to user j at time\nslot t. The Signal to Noise and Interference Ratios (SINRs) at\nthe receiver of user j in time slot t are given by\nSINRj(t) =\n\u2223\u2223hmj(t),j(t)\u2223\u22232 pmj(t),j(t)\u2211N\nl=1,l \u0003=j\n\u2223\u2223hml(t),j(t)\u2223\u22232 pml(t),i(t) + \u03b7j(t) (1)\nwhere |hmj(t),j(t)|2 is the channel power gain from SAmj(t) to\nuser j at time slot t, N is the total number of users within a\ncell (the gray hexagon in Fig. 2), and \u03b7j(t) is the additive noise\npower at the receiver of user j in time slot t. Assuming that\na perfect coding can achieve a transmission rate of Shannon\u2019s\nupper bound, the normalized instantaneous transmission rate of\nuser j is given by\nrj(t) = log2 [1 + SINRj(t)] b\/s\/Hz. (2)\nThus, the long term average transmission rate of user j, denoted\nby Rj , is given as follows:\nRj =\n\u2211T\nt=1 ts \u2217 rj(t)\nT\n(3)\nwhere T is the fairness interval, and ts is the time slot length.\nFairness interval is defined as the number of time slots within\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Resource management module.\nthat the average transmission rates of all users should satisfy\na fairness criterion. The objective of an optimal scheduling\nscheme is to find the optimum values of mj(t) and pmj(t),j(t)\nin order to\nmaximize\nN\u2211\nj=1\nRj (4)\nsubject to:\nN\u2211\nj=1\npmj(t),j(t) = P, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T (5)\nF (R1, . . . , RN ) = 0 (6)\nwhere P is the maximum transmission power budget. Equation\n(5) specifies a constraint on the total allowed power budget.\nF (R1, . . . , RN ) = 0 is the fairness constraint which depends\non the notion of fairness. We adopt a variant of utility fairness in\nthis paper. Given a rate allocation vector (R1, . . . , RN ), utility\nfairness measures the level of fairness by summation of the\nutility of all users. Utility of a user is defined by a concave\nutility function. A brief explanation of utility fairness and the\nmotivations for using it as the fairness criterion is given in\nAppendix A. We also show how to obtain a normalized fair\nallocation vector which can be used as a reference to measure\nfairness of the proposed scheduling scheme in Appendix A.\nThe utility fair allocation vector is an allocation vector which\nspecifies the fairest allocation vector among all feasible al-\nlocation vectors. It can be used to dynamically monitor the\nfairness of a scheduling scheme. If the proportions among the\nactual average allocated rates for different users divert from\nthe fair proportions, the scheduling scheme can adapt itself\nto improve fairness. Unfortunately, the utility fair allocation\nvector cannot be obtained if the information about the quality\nof wireless channels is not available for the entire scheduling\nperiod (i.e., T time slots). In Appendix A, we present an\napproximation to obtain the utility fair allocation vector for a\ngiven scheduling scenario, specified by the average quality of\nthe wireless channels. The proportions are denoted by vector\n(w1, . . . , wN ), and referred to as the fair share weights through-\nout this paper. We consider an allocation vector (R1, . . . , RN )\nas an approximately utility fair allocation vector if\nR1\nw1\n= \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = RN\nwN\n. (7)\nThus, the optimization problem in (4)\u2013(6) can be simplified as\nfollows:\nmaximize\nN\u2211\nj=1\nRj (8)\nsubject to:\nN\u2211\nj=1\npmj(t),j(t) = P, 1 \u2264 t \u2264 T (9)\nR1\nw1\n= \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = RN\nwN\n. (10)\nSolving (8)\u2013(10) to obtain the optimal scheduling is compu-\ntationally infeasible. However, the formulation of the problem\nshould provide a good guideline which can be used to design\nefficient heuristic scheduling schemes.\nB. Cooperative Scheduling Scheme\nWithout a fairness constraint, the optimal scheduling policy\nis to maximize the instantaneous sum of transmission rates from\nthe three SAs. This problem is an special case of the optimal\nresource allocation problem for parallel interference channels\n[16]. To the best of our knowledge, the general solution for this\nproblem has not been obtained yet. However, for a single SA,\nthe problem reduces to an optimal resource allocation for the\nbroadcast Gaussian channels, and the optimal scheduling policy\nto maximize the total system throughput is to transmit to only\none user with the best channel quality in each time slot [6].\nWe adopt this policy for each of the three SAs in our system\nmodel. Each SA transmits to only one user, and three users\nare selected such that the highest instantaneous transmission\nrate can be achieved. Unlike independent scheduling for each\nSA, the data packets of each user may be transmitted from\ndifferent SAs in different time slots. The transmission power\nof the SAs is optimized in order to minimize the interference\namong the SAs. We formulate the optimum power allocation as\na nonlinear programming problem in Appendix B. The problem\ncan be solved by a variety of fast numerical methods.\nTo maintain fairness, we modify the above scheduling strat-\negy by comparing the normalized average throughput of users.\nNormalization is achieved by dividing the average throughput\nof user j to its fair share weight wj . If the normalized aver-\nage throughput of users are not equal, the scheduling scheme\ngives higher priorities to the users with relatively low average\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

In other words, the fair scheduling scheme\nmaximizes the sum of instantaneous transmission rates while\nmaintaining the Rj\/wj ratios approximately equal. The closer\nthe vector (R1\/w1, . . . , RN\/wN ) is to an even vector, the\nhigher is the degree of fairness. To achieve this, the scheduler\nneeds to continuously estimate the average transmission rates\nover the past T time slots. We adopt a low-pass filtering\ntechnique from [8] to estimate the average transmission rates.\nThe scheduler updates the estimations at each time slot by\nR\u02dcj(t) =\n(\n1\u2212 1\nTj\n)\nR\u02dcj(t\u2212 1) + 1\nTj\nrj(t) (11)\nwhere R\u02dcj(t) is the estimation of Rj(t), and rj(t) is the al-\nlocated transmission rate for user j in time slot t. Tj is the\ntime constant of the low-pass filter for user j. We develop an\nalgorithm to compute Tj in the next section.\nAn efficient fairness mechanism should also consider the de-\nviations among the average quality of the channels for different\nusers. When the deviation is large, a high degree of unfairness\nis expected; therefore, strong fairness provision is required. The\nmaximum deviation among the average quality of channels is\ngiven by\n\u03c3 = max\ni,j\n{\na\n(av)\ni,j\n}\n\u2212min\ni,j\n{\na\n(av)\ni,j\n}\n(12)\nwhere a(av)i,j is the average quality of the channel for user j from\nSAi. Let ri,j(t) be the achievable rate from SAi to user j in\ntime slot t. To factor \u03c3 into the scheduling scheme, we define a\nnormalized achievable rate from SAi to user j in time slot t as\nr\u2032i,j(t) =\nri,j(t)\nYj(t)(1+\u03c3)\n(13)\nwhere\nYj(t) =\nR\u02dcj(t)\nwj\u2211N\nj=1\nR\u02dcj(t)\nwj\nN\n. (14)\nYj(t) represents the ratio between the normalized average\ntransmission rate of user j to the mean normalized average\ntransmission rate of all users. Yj(t) > 1 means that user j has\nreceived less than its fair share in the past Tj time slots, and\nvice versa.\nIn summary, the CUFS scheme can be implemented in the\nfollowing steps.\n1) MS j estimates its channel power gain |h1,j(t)|2,\n|h2,j(t)|2, and |h3,j(t)|2 from the three SAs in the associ-\nated cooperation group. The estimated values are reported\nback to a coordination agent through the SA that the\nMS has been originally associated with. The coordination\nagent could be the BSC or one of the SAs in a cooperation\ngroup. To minimize the signaling load the SAs only ex-\nchange the information of the MSs with backlogged data.\n2) The coordination agent computes the normalized achiev-\nable rates, r\u2032i,j(t), by using (13) for i = 1, 2, 3 and j =\n1, . . . , N .\nFig. 4. Nonsmooth service delivery of an opportunistic service discipline.\n3) The coordination agent selects three MSs with the highest\nr\u2032i,j(t) for the next time slot. For example, if r\u20322,5(t),\nr\u20321,15(t), and r\u20323,10(t) are the three highest normalized\nachievable rates, SA2 transmits to MS 5, SA1 transmits to\nMS 15, and SA3 transmits to MS 10 in the next time slot.\n4) For the selected combination of SAs and MSs, the opti-\nmal power allocation and achievable rates are computed\nusing the algorithm in Appendix B.\n5) The SAs exchange a portion of the backlogged data if\nnecessary.\n6) The coordination agent updates R\u02dcj for all of the MSs.\nC. Improving Service Smoothness\nIn addition to achieving high bandwidth utilization and long\nterm fairness, it is also desirable to provide smooth service for\nusers in order to avoid long periods of starvation. An oppor-\ntunistic service discipline with the aforementioned long term\nfairness mechanism can cause a nonsmooth service delivery.\nSome users may not receive any service for a long period of\ntime and receive abundant service in some other periods of time.\nThis can be illustrated in Fig. 4, where the cumulative service\nof a user is plotted versus time. To mitigate the problem, we\npropose an algorithm to compute the value of Tj in (11) by\nusing the service smoothness requirement of users j. We also\ndefine a limit for the minimum value of R\u02dcj(t) such that the\nreturning users who have been in idle state for a relatively long\nperiod of time do not deprive the other users from transmission\nfor a significant period of time.\nLet R(e\ufb00)j (b\/s) be the effective bandwidth requirement of\nuser j, which is the average transmission rate that is required\nto achieve certain QoS [17]. Denote by ts and Lj the duration\nof a time slot in seconds and the average packet length of user\nj in bits, respectively. If a user is served at a transmission rate\nequal to its effective bandwidth, the average required number\nof time slots for transmission of a single packet can be given by\nMj =\nLj\ntsR\n(e\ufb00)\nj\n.

Enhancement of service smoothness.\nWe assume that users are admitted with guaranteed effective\nbandwidth. Denote by Dj the average tolerable delay for trans-\nmission of a single packet for user j. The scheduler should\nallocate Mj time slots to user j in every Dj\/ts time slots. This\ngives an intuitive range for Tj in (11) as\nTj =\nDj\ntsMj\n. (16)\nFurthermore, we define a limit for the minimum value of\nR\u02dcj(t) to avoid excessive access to channel by returning users.\nThis can be done by introducing a new update formula for R\u02dcj(t)\nas\nZj(t) =\n(\n1\u2212 1\nTj\n)\nR\u02dcj(t\u2212 1) + 1\nTj\nrj(t) (17)\nwhere\nR\u02dcj(t) = max\n{\nZj(t), \u03b2 \u00b7R(e\ufb00)j\n}\n(18)\nand \u03b2 is a constant between 0 and 1. In (17), Zj(t) denotes\nthe estimation of the average transmission rate for user j in\nthe past Tj time slots. If Zj(t) is too small such that user j\ngets a very high chance of transmission for many time slots, its\nchance is reduced by letting Rj = \u03b2 \u00b7R(e\ufb00)j . Fig. 5 compares\nthe cumulative service of a user before and after the proposed\nenhancement (for \u03b2 = 0.2). It can be seen that the enhanced\nscheme provides a significantly smoother service.\nD. Multiuser Diversity Gain of the CUFS Scheme\nWe consider a scalar flat fading channel with additive\nnoise. The vector of received symbols at time slot t can be\nmodeled by\ny(t) = h(t)x(t) + n(t) (19)\nwhere x(t), h(t), and n(t) represent the vectors of the trans-\nmitted symbols, the channel-gain, and the impact of additive\nnoise plus interference, respectively [16]. We approximate the\nmaximum achievable transmission rate by Shannon\u2019s capacity\nbound for AWGN channels as\nr(t) = log2\n(\n1 +\na(t)p\n\u03b7\n)\nb\/s\/Hz (20)\nwhere a(t) = |h(t)|2 is the channel power gain, p is the trans-\nmitter power, and \u03b7 is the spectral power density of the additive\nnoise and interference. For an Ergodic fading process, the\nErgodic capacity is defined by\nC = Ea\n[\nlog2\n(\n1 +\nap\n\u03b7\n)]\n(21)\nwhere a is an exponentially distributed random variable rep-\nresenting the ensemble value of a(t), and Ea denotes the\nexpectation of r(t) with respect to a [8].\nFor a multiuser system, where a single transmitter at a BS is\nshared among K users, if the transmission is to a single user\nwith the best channel quality (i.e., the highest a(t) at each time\nslot), the maximum achievable transmission rate at time slot t\ncan be approximated by\nrK(t) = log2\n[\n1 +\np\n\u03b7\nmax\nk\n(ak(t))\n]\n(22)\nwhere k is the user index. Extending (21) to the multiuser case,\nwe have\nCK = EA log2\n[\n1 +\np\n\u03b7\nA\n]\n(23)\nwhere A = max(a1, . . . , aK). Consider two distinct schedul-\ning schemes with K1 and K2 users, respectively. Since log2(\u00b7)\nis a monotonically increasing function, for any K1 \u2264 K2,\nCK1 \u2264 CK2 . Thus, the larger the number of users, the larger is\nthe system capacity. The improvement of system capacity due\nto the number of users is known as multiuser diversity gain.\nThe aforementioned argument can be used to evaluate multi-\nuser diversity gain of the CUFS scheme. From Fig. 2, let\nK1, K2, and K3 be the number of users in the three sectors\nassociated with SA1, SA2, and SA3, respectively. We compare\nmultiuser diversity gain of a cooperative scheduler with three\nindividual noncooperative schedulers. For the noncooperative\nschedulers, since a separate scheduler is for each SA, the total\nErgodic capacity is CK1 + CK2 + CK3 . For the cooperative\nscheduler, a single scheduler coordinates transmissions from\nthree independent SAs, as specified by the CUFS scheme. Since\nthe cooperative scheduler selects three users for transmission\nfrom a pool of K1 +K2 +K3 users, the Ergodic capacity is\nCK1+K2+K3 + CK1+K2+K3 + CK1+K2+K3 . In other words,\nthe cooperative scheduling increases multiuser diversity gain\nby virtually increasing the effective number of users for each\nscheduler.\nV. SIMULATION RESULTS\nWe use a standard 19-cell simulation model [18], as shown\nin Fig. 6. The model accommodates one center cell and 18\ninterfering cells in two tiers. Each cell is covered by three SAs,\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 17,2010 at 07:13:02 EST from IEEE Xplore.

Simulation model for a cellular network.\nTABLE I\nSIMULATION PARAMETERS OF THE FADING CHANNELS\nand there are 57 SAs. The maximum power budget of each SA\nis 1 W; thus, the maximum total power budget of a group of\nthree SAs, covering a single cell, is 3 W. Scheduling is only per-\nformed in the center cell. However, interference from all other\nSAs are considered. Wireless channels from the interfering SAs\nto the users in the center cell are modeled by considering path\nloss only. However, channels from the SAs of the center cell\nto the users in the center cell are modeled by considering path\nloss, shadowing, and fast Rayleigh fading. Samples of Rayleigh\nfading are generated by low pass filtering of two white Gaussian\nrandom sequences. The parameters of the channel simulator are\nsummarized in Table I. The transmitted signals from different\nSAs are separated by suborthogonal spreading codes.\nWe simulate the PFS and the CUFS schemes since both\nschemes implement a similar opportunistic service discipline.\nThe comparison of the two schemes should demonstrate the\nimpacts of cooperative scheduling. For the PFS scheme, we\nimplement three independent schedulers for three different\nSAs of the center cell. For the CUFS scheme, a cooperative\nscheduler coordinates transmission from the three SAs covering\nthe center cell. The normalized values of different parameters\nfor the schedulers are given in Table II. To evaluate the fairness\nof the schedulers, we use Gini fairness index [19] as follows:\nI =\n1\n2N2u\u00af\nN\u2211\nk=1\nN\u2211\nl=1\n|uk \u2212 ul| (24)\nwhere uk = R\u02dck\/wk, u = (u1, . . . , uN ), and u\u00af = (\n\u2211N\nk=1 uk)\/\nN . R\u02dck and wk are the long term average transmission rate and\nthe fair share weight of user k, respectively. To ensure accuracy\nof the results, Monte Carlo simulations for one million time\nTABLE II\nPARAMETERS OF THE CUFS SCHEME\nFig. 7. Throughput for symmetric user distribution.\nslots have been performed for each result. We explain the\nresults in the following two sections.\nA. Symmetric Users\nBy symmetry, the average channel gains from three SAs\nto a particular user are identical. Although this is rarely a\npractical scenario, it can be used as a benchmark to evaluate\nthe performance of the scheduling schemes. For each user, the\nreceived signal power from three SAs is equal. This means\nthat the interference among the three SAs is strong. The total\nthroughput and fairness index in the center cell versus the\nnumber of users are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. It\ncan be seen that the CUFS scheme significantly outperforms\nthe PFS scheme in terms of throughput and fairness when there\nis a strong level of interference among SAs. As the number of\nusers increases, the throughput, as well as the level of unfairness\nof the PFS scheme increase. In contrary, the CUFS scheme\nsacrifices the inherent multiuser diversity gain to maintain\nfairness as the number of users increases.\nB. Asymmetric Users\nAsymmetry means that each user has different channel gains\nfrom the three SAs. The interference among the SAs is weak for\na high asymmetric user distribution. We define a normalized\nparameter, namely symmetry coefficient, to quantify the level\nof symmetry. When the symmetry coefficient is one, the system\nis fully symmetric similar to Section V-A. In other words,\nthe interference among the three SAs is the highest. On the\nother hand, when the symmetry coefficient is zero, the user\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Fairness index for symmetric user distribution.\nFig. 9. Throughput versus symmetry coefficient.\ndistribution is highly asymmetric, and the interference among\nSAs is the lowest.\nFor asymmetric user distribution, the fairness index and the\nthroughput versus the symmetry coefficient are shown in Figs. 9\nand 10, respectively. The results are obtained with 36 users in\nthe center cell. It can be seen that the PFS scheme outperforms\nthe CUFS scheme in terms of throughput when the interference\namong SAs is not severe. However, superiority of the PFS\nscheme in terms of throughput is achieved by a more unfair rate\nallocation among the users. If we relax the fairness mechanism\nof the CUFS scheme a little bit, as it can be seen in Figs. 11 and\n12, without losing much fairness, the CUFS can outperform the\nPFS scheme in terms of throughput for the entire range of the\nsymmetry coefficient.\nVI.

We\nhave shown that a cooperative scheduling increases multiuser\ndiversity gain by increasing the effective number of users. Op-\ntimal power allocation among the SAs also reduces interference\nfrom the adjacent BSs, thereby improving the total system\nthroughput. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that\ncooperative scheduling significantly increases system through-\nput while maintaining a good level of fairness among users.\nPerformance improvement is particularly remarkable for the\nusers located near the cell boundaries where interference among\nthe adjacent BSs is high.\nAPPENDIX A\nFAIRNESS\nA proper definition of fairness depends on the application do-\nmain. Traditional definitions such as max\u2013min fairness do not\nproperly address the issue in wireless domain [15]. Variations\nof utility fairness [4] are widely accepted fairness criterion for\nwireless resource allocation schemes. We adopt a utility-based\ndefinition of fairness, i.e., a fair rate allocation vector is the\nsolution of a concave maximization problem as follows:\n{\nmaxRH(R) =\n\u2211N\nj=1 Uj(Rj)\nF (R) = 0\n(25)\nwhere R = (R1, . . . , RN ) is the rate allocation vector, Rj is\nthe allocated rate to user j, Uj(\u00b7) is the utility function of user\nj, N is the number of users, and F (r) = 0 specifies a set of\nconstraints. The utility function is a concave function.1 The\nrelation between the maximization problem in (25) and the\nconcept of fairness can be explained by a simple example as\nfollows. Consider a resource allocation problem with N users.\nLet all of the N users have similar utility functions, given\nby Uj(x) = ln(x+ 1), and the sum of the allocated rates be\nlimited by some value, e.g.,\n\u2211\nj Rj = 1. The fair rate allocation\nvector can be obtained by solving the following optimization\nproblem: {\nmaxRH(R) =\n\u2211N\nj=1 ln(Rj + 1)\u2211N\nj=1Rj = 1\n. (26)\nThe Lagrange function for (26) can be written as\nJ(R1, . . . , RN ) =\nN\u2211\nj=1\nln(Rj + 1) + \u03bb\nN\u2211\nj=1\nRj (27)\nwhere \u03bb is the Lagrange multiplier. Differentiating (27) with\nrespect to Rj , we have\n1\nRj + 1\n+ \u03bb = 0. (28)\n1A function f(x) is concave on an interval [a, b] if for any two points x1 and\nx2 in [a, b], f [(1\/2)(x1 + x2)] \u2265 (1\/2)[f(x1) + f(x2)].\nApplying the constraint\n\u2211N\nj=1Rj = 1, the fair rate allocation\nvector can be found as (1\/N, . . . , 1\/N). The solution is an even\nrate allocation vector. We can extend the result to any other\nform of concave utility functions. In other words, if the utility\nfunctions are identical and concave, the utility fair allocation\nvector is an even vector. Fair allocation vector depends on the\ndefinition of utility functions. Let x = R \u00b7 \u03b1, xmin = Rmin \u00b7\n\u03b1, and xmax = Rmax \u00b7 \u03b1 be the weighted average rate, the\nweighted minimum average rate, and the weighted maximum\naverage rate of a user, respectively. \u03b1 is a weighting factor\nwhich will be explained later. We define the utility function of\na user as\nU(x) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\uf8f3\nln(1 + x), x < xmin\u221a\nln(1 + x) + b, xmin \u2264 x \u2264 xmax\n4\n\u221a\nln(1 + x) + c, x > xmax\n(29)\nwhere b and c are embedded to force continuity of the utility\nfunction, and are given by\nb = ln(1 + xmin)\u2212\n\u221a\nln(1 + xmin)\nc = ln(1 + xmax) + ln(1 + xmin)\n\u2212\n\u221a\nln(1 + xmin)\u2212 4\n\u221a\nln(1 + xmax). (30)\nThe minimum and maximum average rates define a desired op-\nerating region for the user to make the utility function sensitive\nto the allocated rate. Allocating a rate belowRmin is considered\nas a significant performance degradation, and allocating a rate\nbeyond Rmax does not increase the actual utility of a user.\nThese parameters differentiate the utility functions of different\nusers. The scaling factor, \u03b1 \u2265 1, determines the proximity of\nthe fair allocation vector to an even rate allocation vector. For\na large \u03b1, the solution of (25) is close to an even allocation\nvector.\nA simple two-user power allocation problem can be used to\ndemonstrate the properties of the proposed utility function. Let\n(xmin, xmax) be (3, 7) and (2, 9) for users 1 and 2, respectively.\nUsing (29), the utility function can be obtained, as shown in\nFig. 13. Let the channel power gains be a1 = 0 dB and a2 =\n10 dB for users 1 and 2, respectively. The total power budget is\nconstrained by\np1 + p2 = 1 (31)\nwhere p1 and p2 are the transmission power of users 1 and 2,\nrespectively. The fair rate and power allocation vectors can be\nobtained by solving the following optimization problem:\n\uf8f1\uf8f4\uf8f2\uf8f4\uf8f3\nmax(p1,p2) H(x1, x2) = U1(x1) + U2(x2)\nxj = \u03b1 \u00b7Rj\nRj = log2(1 + ajpj) b\/s\/Hz\np1 + p2 = 1\n.

Two sample utility functions.\nFor instance, if\n{User 1 : Rmin = 0.3, Rmax = 0.7\nUser 2 : Rmin = 0.1, Rmax = 0.5\n\u03b1 = 1\nthe fair power allocation vector is (p1 = 0.68, p2 = 0.32), and\nthe fair rate allocation vector is (R1 = 0.37, R2 = 1.03). If{User 1 : Rmin = 0.3, Rmax = 0.7\nUser 2 : Rmin = 0.1, Rmax = 0.5\n\u03b1 = 1\nthe fair allocation vector is (p1 = 0.77, p2 = 0.23), and the fair\npower allocation vector is (R1 = 0.41, R2 = 0.85).\nIncreasing the value of \u03b1 results in more even rate distrib-\nution but with more unfair power (i.e., effort) allocation and\nreduction in the total system throughput. In other words, smaller\nvalues of \u03b1 result in more even effort distribution, and larger\nvalues of \u03b1 yield more even rate distributions. To demonstrate\nthe impacts of xmin and xmax, let{User 1 : Rmin = 0.6, Rmax = 0.7\nUser 2 : Rmin = 0.1, Rmax = 0.5\n\u03b1 = 10\n.\nThe fair power allocation vector is (p1 = 0.87, p2 = 0.13), and\nthe fair rate allocation vector is (R1 = 0.45, R2 = 0.59). It can\nbe seen that asRmin of user 1 is increased from 0.3 in (33) to 0.6\nin (33), its allocated power is increased from p1 = 0.77 to p1 =\n0.87. Sensitivity of the fair allocation vector to Rmax can also\nbe seen, similarly. Thus, the proposed notion of fairness 1) is\nsensitive to QoS; 2) effort unfairness; and 3) service unfairness.\nFurthermore, \u03b1 can be used to adjust sensitivity to effort and\nservice unfairness.\nWe use the aforementioned notion of fairness to define fair\nshare weights, denoted by (w1, . . . , wN ). The fair share weights\nFig. 14. Power allocation scenario.\nare used to evaluate fairness of resource allocation schemes in\na similar system settings.

The nonlinear optimization problem\nin (33) can be solved by nonlinear programming techniques.\nAfter computing pj by solving (33), the fair share weights is\nobtained by\nwj = log2(1 + ajpj). (34)\nAPPENDIX B\nOPTIMAL POWER ALLOCATION\nWe develop an optimal power allocation scheme for a sce-\nnario illustrated in Fig. 14. In this scenario, SAi intends to\ntransmit to user i; however, the received signal by user i will\nbe affected by the interference of the other two SAs. The\nobjective is to divide a limited power budget among the SAs\nin order to maximize the sum of transmission rates. Assuming\nscalar flat fading channels from the SAs to the mobile users,\nthe instantaneous received signals by user 1, 2, and 3 can be\nrepresented, respectively, by\nY1(t) =h1,1(t)X1(t) + h2,1(t)X2(t) + h3,1(t)X3(t) + n1(t)\nY2(t) =h1,2(t)X1(t) + h2,2(t)X2(t) + h3,2(t)X3(t) + n2(t)\nY3(t) =h1,3(t)X1(t) + h2,3(t)X2(t) + h3,3(t)X3(t) + n3(t)\n(35)\nwhere Xi(t) is the transmitted signal from SAi to user i, Yi(t)\nis the received signal by user i, hi,j(t) is the complex Gaussian\nchannel gain from SAi to user j at time slot t, and ni(t) is the\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

The SINR seen by the users\ncan be given by\nSINR1 =\n|h1,1|2p1\n|h2,1|2p2 + |h3,1|2p3 + \u03b71\nSINR2 =\n|h2,2|2p1\n|h1,2|2p1 + |h3,2|2p3 + \u03b72\nSINR3 =\n|h3,3|2p1\n|h1,3|2p1 + |h2,3|2p2 + \u03b72 (36)\nwhere pi is the transmission power of SAi, and \u03b7i is the\npower of the additive noise seen by user i. To simplify the\nmanipulations, we have dropped time slot index t in (36). As-\nsuming that the fading envelopes are constant for the entire time\nslot duration and the noise-plus-interference has a Gaussian\ndistribution, Shannon\u2019s capacity formula can be used to specify\nthe maximum achievable rates as follows:\nr1 = log2(1 + SINR1) b\/s\/Hz\nr2 = log2(1 + SINR2) b\/s\/Hz\nr3 = log2(1 + SINR3) b\/s\/Hz (37)\nwhere ri is the achievable transmission rate from SAi to user\ni. Let P denote the total power budget, i.e., p1 + p2 + p3 =\nP . The system capacity region is defined as a region in the\n3-D space (r1, rr, r3), where all rate tuples are achievable by\nappropriate coding and power allocation schemes. The optimal\npower allocation problem is to find the power allocation vector\n(p1, p2, p3) that maximizes the sum of transmission rates. This\ncan be specified by the following optimization problem:\n{max(p1,p2,p3) rs = r1 + r2 + r3\np1 + p2 + p3 = P\n(38)\nwhere rs is the sum of transmission rates.
