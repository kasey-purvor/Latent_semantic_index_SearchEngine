A Laman graph represents a configuration of points on\nthe Euclidean plane with just enough distance specifications between them to\nensure rigidity. Formally, a Laman graph is a maximally independent graph,\nthat is, one that satisfies the vertex-edge count 2v \u2212 3 = e together with\na corresponding inequality for each subgraph. The following main theorem\nof the paper resolves a conjecture of Owen (1991) in the planar case. Let\nG be a maximally independent 3-connected planar graph, with more than 3\nvertices, together with a realisable assignment of generic distances for the edges\nwhich includes a normalised unit length (base) edge. Then, for any solution\nconfiguration for these distances on a plane, with the base edge vertices placed\nat rational points, not all coordinates of the vertices lie in a radical extension\nof the distance field.\n1. Introduction\nA fundamental problem in Computer Aided Design (CAD) is the formulation of\neffective algebraic algorithms or numerical approximation schemes which solve for\nthe location of points on a plane, given a set of relative distances between them.\nFor CAD applications the relevant class of configurations are those for which the\ndistances are just sufficient to ensure that the points are located rigidly with respect\nto one another. It is a well-known result of Laman [10] that the graphs underlying\ngenerically rigid configurations (frameworks) have a simple combinatorial descrip-\ntion. In our terminology they are the so-called maximally independent graphs, that\nis, those satisfying the vertex-edge count 2v \u2212 3 = e together with a corresponding\ninequality for each subgraph.\nA number of algebraic and numerical methods have been proposed for solving\nthese plane configurations (Owen [12], Bouma et al. [2], Light and Gossard [11]),\nand these have been successfully implemented in CAD programs. Algebraic and\ncombinatorial algorithms for graphs are particularly desirable for their speed and\nrobustness and the resulting dramatic efficiency gains. For instances of this see,\nfor example, the quadratic extension algorithm of [12], the graph decomposition\nalgorithm of Hopcroft and Tarjan [9], or the combinatorial approach to protein\nmolecule flexibility in Jacobs et al.

POWER\nCurrent algebraic methods for solving Laman graphs assemble the solution for\ncomplete configurations from the solutions of rigid subcomponents. By introducing\na limited coupling between rigid subgraphs in the form of virtual edges, we have\nshown [12] that the solutions for any Laman graph can be constructed from the\nsuccessive combination of solutions to certain basic subgraphs (see section 3 below).\nThe recombination consists of matching the basic subgraphs at appropriate pairs of\nvertices and requires only the solution of linear equations. The basic rigid subgraphs\nconsist of triangles of edges (some edges may be virtual) which are readily solved\nusing quadratic equations, and graphs which are vertex 3-connected [17]. In this\nway the problem of solving general configurations reduces to the problem of solving\nconfigurations which are represented by 3-connected graphs. Determination of 3-\nconnectivity can be effected rapidly with order O(v + e). (See [9].)\nWe have previously suggested that with generic distance values a subcompo-\nnent which is represented by a 3-connected graph cannot be solved by quadratic\nequations (Owen [12]). Configurations that can be solved in this way are also\nknown as \u201cruler and compass constructible\u201d, and Gao and Chou [6] have given\na procedure for determining in principle if any given configuration is ruler and\ncompass constructible. However their analysis is based on the detail of derived\nelimination equations, and they do not address the problem of generic solubility or\nnon-solubility for general classes of graphs.\nDespite the importance of algebraic solubility, the intractability or otherwise of\ngeneric 3-connected configurations has not been put on a firm theoretical basis, and\nin the present paper we begin such a project.\nThe solution configurations that we consider are comprised of points in the plane\nwith a number of specified distances between them. With the natural correspon-\ndence of points to vertices and constraint pairs to edges, each constraint system has\nan associated abstract graph. It is the nature of the abstract graph that is signifi-\ncant for the solubility of the constraint system, and we shall be concerned with the\nsituation where the abstract graph is a planar graph in the usual graph-theoretic\nsense; it can be drawn with edges realised by curves in the plane with no crossings.\nWe show that a planar 3-connected maximally independent graph with generic\ndistances is not only not solvable by quadratic extensions but is not soluble by\nradical extensions, that is, by means of the extraction of roots of arbitrary order\ntogether with the basic arithmetical operations. In fact our methods make use of\nsome intricate planar graph theory leading to an edge contraction reduction scheme\nwhich is also of independent interest. The main theorem of the paper can be stated\nas follows.\nTheorem 1.1. Let G be a maximally independent 3-connected planar graph, with\nmore than 3 vertices, together with a realisable assignment of generic distances\nfor the edges which includes a normalised unit length (base) edge. Then, for any\nsolution configuration for these distances on a plane, with the base edge vertices\nplaced at rational points, not all coordinates of the vertices lie in a radical extension\nof the field of rational numbers.\nIt follows in particular that the current algebraic schemes already solve all of the\ngeneric configurations with a planar graph that can be solved by radical extensions!\nAlso, we conjecture that planarity is not necessary for this conclusion.\nAlthough our initial focus on planar graphs was made in order to identify a class\nof graphs for which we could complete a proof, we have subsequently found that\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2271\nFigure 1. The doublet and K33.\nplanar Laman graphs are of specific interest in robotics problems, and so even this\npartial proof has some merit. See [15], [16] and [7].\nRecall that a celebrated and fundamental achievement of classical Galois theory\nis that a polynomial of degree 5 or more, with rational coefficients, is not gener-\nally soluble by radical extensions over Q. For a generic version of this, one can\nassert that a generic monic polynomial of degree r \u2265 5 is not soluble by radical\nextensions of the base field Q({d}), where {d} = {d1, ..., dr\u22121} are the generic (al-\ngebraically independent) coefficients. In this case, with coefficient field understood,\nthe polynomial is said to be, simply, non-soluble. These facts suggest that if one is\npresented, as we are here, with N polynomial equations in N unknowns, with no\napparent step-by-step solution scheme involving at most degree 4 polynomials, then\nsolutions will not lie in radical extensions of the coefficient field. On the other hand,\npossibly working against this intuition is the fact that our constraint equations are\nall of quadratic type, in four variables, with a single generic constant term, and\nthe variables of the equations reflect a (planar) graph structure which may possess\nan intrinsic reduction scheme. However our result shows that in fact there can\nbe no grounds for a solution scheme by radical extraction which embraces more\nthan the known quadratically soluble graphs. To paraphrase Theorem 1.1, planar\nembeddable 3-connected Laman graphs are generically non-soluble.\nLet us now outline the structure of the proof, the entirety of which is lengthy and\neclectic, making use of graph theory, elimination theory for the ideals of complex\naffine varieties, Galois theory for specialised coefficient fields, and a brute force\ndemonstration of the non-solubility of a vertex minimal 3-connected maximally\nindependent planar graph. We refer to this graph, indicated in Figure 1, as the\ndoublet.\nThe fact that the generic doublet graph is not soluble by radicals is obtained in\nSection 8 by first obtaining an explicit doublet with integral lengths which is not\nsoluble. Here the Galois groups of univariate polynomials in the elimination ideals\nfor the constraint equations are computed with some computer algebra assistance.\nGeneric non-solubility then follows from our Galois group specialisation theorem.\nThe strategy of the proof is to show that if there exists a graph G which is\nmaximally independent, planar, 3-connected and radically soluble, then there is\na smaller such graph with fewer vertices. By the minimality of the doublet this\nimplies that the doublet is radically soluble, which gives the desired contradiction.\nThere are two aspects to the reduction step. The first of these is purely graph\ntheoretic and is dealt with in the extensive analysis of Section 4. The main theorem\nthere shows that a 3-connected planar maximally independent graph G has either\nan edge e in a triangle of edges which can be contracted to give a smaller such\n2272 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\ngraph G\/e, or has a maximally independent subgraph which can be replaced by a\ntriangle to produce a smaller such graph, say H. The second aspect is to connect\nthe solubility of the (finite) variety of solutions for the distance specified graph G,\nwith generic distances, to that of the varieties of the resulting smaller graphs. In\nthe latter case we can simply compare generic constraint equations (see Proposition\n8.1) to deduce that\ngeneric G radical \u21d2 generic H radical.\nHowever the former case of edge contraction is much more subtle. We approach\nthis by noting first that the complex variety V (G\/e) of solutions for the generic\ncontracted graph is identifiable with the variety of solutions for G with partially\nspecialised distances, with the contracted edge distance de specialised to 0 and the\ntwo other edges of the contracted triangle specified as being equal. This gives the\neasy implication\nspecialised G radical \u21d2 generic G\/e radical.\nHowever we now need the final step, that is, the implication\ngeneric G radical \u21d2 specialised G radical.\nTo obtain this we carefully consider the polynomials which are the generators of\nthe single variable elimination ideals associated with the constraint equations. We\nrelate these generators to the corresponding polynomials for the ideals of the spe-\ncialised equations. In fact we relate the solubility of these polynomials through a\ntwo-step process for the double specialisation. This is effected in Sections 5, 6. The\nproof of the final step is then completed by means of another application of the\nGalois group specialisation theorem, Theorem 7.2. This theorem asserts, roughly\nspeaking, that the Galois group of a polynomial p is a subgroup of the Galois group\nof a polynomial P when p derives from P by partial specialisation of coefficients.\nWe were unable to find a reference for this seemingly classical assertion.\nLet us highlight two very important ideas which run through the proof of the\nreduction step for edge contractions (Theorem 6.1).\nThe first of these is that we must restrict our attention to graphs whose constraint\nequations, both generic and specialised, have finitely many complex solutions. This\nform of rigidity for complex variables is zero dimensionality, and its significance\nis explained fully in the next section. It guarantees that univariate elimination\nideals for the constraint equations are generated by univariate polynomials. Un-\nfortunately, to maintain zero dimensionality our contraction scheme to the doublet\nmust operate entirely in the framework of maximally independent graphs, and it is\nthis that necessitates the extended graph theory of Section 4.\nThe second important idea is that the constraint equations happen to be of\nparametric type. As is well known this means that various associated complex\naffine varieties are irreducible, and in particular (Theorem 2.8) this is so for the\nso-called big variety in which the coordinates of vertices and the distances of edges\nare viewed as complex variables. With irreducibility present we can arrange the\nunivariate generators of single variable elimination ideals to be irreducible over the\nappropriate field (Theorem 5.2), and so either all roots of the generator are radical\nor none are. Now it is the case that not every root of the generator need derive\nfrom a solution of the constraint equations. Thus the fact that either all roots or\nno roots are radical allows us to compare the solubility or otherwise of G and G\/e\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2273\nby examining the solubility or otherwise of these univariate generators (Theorem\n5.3).\nFinally, we remark that the assumption that graphs have a planar embedding is\nused to guarantee that there is a reduction scheme to a minimal graph based on\ncontracting edges. We expect that there are more general reduction schemes which\nterminate in either the doublet or the non-planar graph K33. Also we are able\nto show that K33 is generically non-soluble, and this gives further support to our\nconjecture that general 3-connected maximally independent graphs are non-soluble.\nThe results of this article were announced at the Fourth International Workshop\non Automated Deduction in Geometry in September 2002 [13]. We thank Walter\nWhiteley for helpful discussions and for directing our attention to the paper of\nAsimov and Roth [1], and we thank the referee for some helpful clarifications.\n2. Constraint equations and algebraic varieties\nWe begin by formulating the main problem which is to determine the complex\nalgebraic variety arising from the solutions to the constraint equations of a distance\nspecified graph.\nLet G = (V,E) be a graph with vertex set V and edge set E. We are concerned\nwith the problem of determining coordinates (xv, yv) for each vertex v so that for\nsome preassigned distances for the edges e in E, we have solutions to the set of\nequations\nfe = 0, e \u2208 E,\nwhere, for the edge e = (vw),\nfe = (xv \u2212 xw)2 + (yv \u2212 yw)2 \u2212 de.\nThe distances de are taken to be non-negative real numbers, representing the square\nof the edge lengths of realised graphs.\nIt is convenient to refer to the set {fe} as a set of (unnormalised) constraint\nequations for the graph. Although in practice one is interested primarily in the real\nsolutions in R2 for the vertices, which in turn account for the Euclidean realisations\nof the distance specified graph, it is essential to our approach that we consider all\ncomplex solutions. One reason for this is that solutions always exist and we can\nemploy the elimination theory for complex algebraic varieties.\nBearing in mind the multiplicity of solutions associated with Euclidean isome-\ntries we assume that for some base edge b = (vw) in E we have db = 1 and the\nspecification (xv, yv) = (0, 0), (xw, yw) = (1, 0). This gives rise to a set of normalised\nconstraint equations {fe}. If, in addition, the distances are algebraically indepen-\ndent, then we say that {fe} is a set of generic constraint equations for G. We shall\ngenerally assume that distance sets and sets of constraint equations are normalised.\nLet (G, {de}) be a graph with normalised distance specification, with n vertices,\nand let xi, yi, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 2, be the coordinate variables for the non-base ver-\ntices. We write V ({fe}) for the complex affine variety in C2n\u22124 determined by the\ncorresponding set of constraint equations {fe}.\nDefinition 2.1. The distance specified graph (G, {de}) is said to be zero dimen-\nsional if the complex algebraic variety V ({fe}) is zero dimensional, that is, V ({fe})\nis a finite non-empty set.\n2274 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nThere is a connection between our general formalism and that of the theory of\nrigid frameworks, and in particular the notion of an independent graph is taken\nfrom this context.\nDefinition 2.2. Let G be a graph with vG vertices and eG edges. Then G is said to\nbe independent if for every vertex induced subgraph H, we have 2vH\u2212eH \u2265 3. The\ngraph G is said to be maximally independent if it is independent and in addition\n2vG \u2212 eG = 3.\nThe graphs for which generic distances give zero-dimensional varieties admit a\nsimple combinatorial description, namely they are precisely the maximally inde-\npendent graphs. Such graphs are also known colloquially as Laman graphs since\nthis equivalence follows readily from a celebrated theorem of Laman on the char-\nacterisation of rigid frameworks. In fact we shall only need one direction, proved\nin Theorem 2.4, namely that maximally independent graphs with generic distances\nare zero dimensional.\nLet us indicate more fully the nature and significance of zero dimensionality.\nIn the theory of bar-joint structures [19] a configuration is called generic if the\ncoordinates of the points are algebraically independent and real. This implies that\nthe distances are also algebraically independent and real. The usual definitions of\nrigidity (no continuous path of motion) and infinitesimal rigidity (maximal rank\nJacobean) refer to the properties of a single point in the real variety defined by\nthe constraint equations. By contrast our definition of zero dimensionality refers\nto all the zeros of the variety and admits complex values for the coordinates. It\nis well known that for generic Laman graphs rigidity and infinitesimal rigidity are\nequivalent [1], and we show in Theorem 2.4 that these imply zero dimensionality.\nFor non-generic distances however, zero dimensionality is a stronger requirement\nthan (real) rigidity. To appreciate this consider the maximally independent graph\nin Figure 2 which we view as a graph with normalised generic distances {de}. In\nparticular these distances admit real solutions such as the one realised by Figure\n2. The two arrowed edges suggest a specialisation of {de} to a new distance set\n{d\u2032e} for the same graph in which the arrowed edges have length zero and two pairs\nof edges are of equal length. If the points of the variety are required to be real,\nthen the specialisation of both of the arrowed distances to be zero implies that the\ncoordinates of their end points are exactly the same. The real zeros of this semi-\ngeneric configuration thus correspond exactly with the zeros of the generic doublet\n(which is rigid at all of its zeros by Laman\u2019s theorem). However if the coordinates\nof the points can be complex, then the degeneracy of the arrowed edge in the centre\nof the graph requires only that its end points have (x1 \u2212 x2)2 + (y1 \u2212 y2)2 = 0,\nwhich implies only that (x1 \u2212 x2) = \u00b1i(y1 \u2212 y2). In particular the tail vertex\n(x1, y1) of this arrowed edge can be placed in complex coordinates to realise its\nremaining constraint. (The end points of the arrowed edge at the lower left are in\nfact constrained to be identical because the zero length edge is in a triangle of edges.)\nPlainly the doublet graph becomes flexible in real coordinates when the distance\nconstraint at the centre is removed. For these configurations of the vertices we can\nchoose (x1, y1) in complex coordinates to realise the remaining constraint for the\noriginal distanced graph. In this way it follows that its variety is one dimensional.\nIn fact the specialised equations determine a complex one-dimensional variety in\nC12 which meets the real subset R12 in a finite set.\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2275\nFigure 2. Specialisation of a quadratically soluble graph onto a doublet.\nThe graph in Figure 2 is not 3-connected, since there is a vertex of degree 2. In\nfact it is quadratically soluble in the sense expressed in Theorem 3.2. However the\ncontracted graph (the doublet) is 3-connected and not quadratically soluble, as we\nwill show in a subsequent section.\nThese observations show that in any reduction scheme for the proof involving\nedge contractions and their resulting non-generic distance sets it is necessary to\nwork with the zero-dimensional settings rather than with rigidity in the usual sense.\nSee [1] and [20] for various discussions of rigidity for frameworks.\nThe following general theorem will be used in the proof of Theorem 2.4. By a\nspecialisation of the distance set {de} in Cn (generally an algebraically independent\nset) we mean a set {d\u2032e} in which some or all of the de have been replaced by rational\nnumbers.\nTheorem 2.3. Let V be a complex affine variety in Cn defined by polynomial\nequations of the form\nfi = hi({xj})\u2212 di = 0, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\nwhere {hi} are polynomials with rational coefficients in the complex variables {xj} =\n{x1, ..., xn}, and where {di} is a set of constants in C. If J is the n \u00d7 n matrix\nJ = (Jij) = (dfi\/dxj) and det(J) is not identically zero as a polynomial in {xj},\nthen\n(1) The coordinates {xj} of any zero of V are algebraically independent as a set\nif and only if the constants {di} are algebraically independent as a set.\n(2) If {di} are algebraically independent, then dim(V ) = 0.\nProof. Suppose that {di} are algebraically dependent; then there is some polyno-\nmial p in n variables with p(d1, . . . , dn) = 0. Define the polynomial q by q({xj}) =\np(h1({xj}), . . . , hn({xj})). Then q is not the zero polynomial because det(dhi\/dxj)\nis not zero, and so q has a point where it evaluates non-zero. On the other hand it\nis clear that q vanishes at any zero of V .\nConversely, suppose that {xj} are algebraically dependent. Then there is some\npolynomial q in n variables with q({xj}) = 0. Consider the ideal\nI = \u3008f({di}, {xj}), q({xj})\u3009\nand its variety W in C2n (where we abuse notation with d1, . . . , dn variables). This\nvariety has dimension n \u2212 1 because it is isomorphic to V (\u3008q({xj})\u3009) in Cn under\n2276 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nthe isomorphism ({di}, {xj}) \u2192 {xj}. On the other hand if the elimination ideal\nI\u2229C[{di}] is empty, then it follows from the closure theorem (see Theorem 5.1) that\nW has dimension at least n. This proves the existence of a non-zero polynomial\np({di}) in I. This polynomial evaluates to zero on the specific distances associated\nwith the point {xj} since the generators of I vanish on these points.\nAny algebraically independent set {xj} defines an algebraically independent set\n{di} for which V is not empty. It follows that V is not empty for all algebraically\nindependent {di} because V is empty only if the ideal of V contains a constant\nelement of the field Q({di}). Also, any zero of V for algebraically independent {di}\nhas algebraically independent coordinates {xj}, and so every point of V has det(J)\nnon-zero. It follows that dim(V ) = 0. \u0001\nThe next theorem now follows from Laman\u2019s theorem.\nTheorem 2.4. Let G be a maximally independent graph with e edges and nor-\nmalised constraint equations {fi}, and let V be the associated variety in Ce\u22121 for\nalgebraically independent {d}. Then dim(V ) = 0.\nProof. The normalised constraint equations have the form required by Theorem 2.3\nabove while Theorem 6.5 of [9] implies that det(J) is not zero as a polynomial in\n{xj}. \u0001\nWe shall use elimination theory to study the varieties arising from various ideals\ngenerated by the constraint equations. In order to keep track of the nature of\nsolutions (whether they are radical or not) it will be important, as we have intimated\nin the Introduction, to identify generators of one variable elimination ideals which\nare irreducible polynomials. Theorem 2.8 below will be needed to achieve this.\nDefinition 2.5. Let I be an ideal in the polynomial ring k[x1, ..., xm] over a field\nk. Then I is prime if whenever fg is in I, then either f is in I or g is in I.\nProposition 2.6. If I is a prime ideal in k[x1, ..., xm] and if {xi1 , ..., xit} is a\nsubset of {xi}, then the elimination ideal\nI \u2229 k[xi1 , ..., xit ]\nis also a prime ideal.\nWe now make a simple but important observation. The constraint equations for\na graph are a parametric set when viewed as equations in the vertex coordinate\nvariables and the distances. Indeed they are parametric in the vertex coordinate\nvariables. From this it follows that various associated complex algebraic varieties\nare irreducible. For a discussion of such irreducibility see [4]. Thus we have the\nfollowing general theorem which in turn gives the irreducibility of what we call the\nbig variety Vb.\nTheorem 2.7. Let x = {x1, . . . , xm}, d = {d1, . . . , dr} be indeterminates defining\nthe polynomial ring Q[x, d]. Let fi(x, d) be polynomials of the form hi(x)\u2212 di, 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 r, and let I be the ideal of polynomials in Q[x, d] which vanish on the variety\ndetermined by {fi : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r}. Then I is a prime ideal.\nTheorem 2.8. Let G be a maximally independent graph with n vertices and let {f}\nbe the normalised constraint equations for G for the distance set {de} = {d1, ..., dr}\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2277\n(where r = |E(G)|\u22121). Let Vb \u2286 C2n\u22124+r be the complex affine variety determined\nby {f} as polynomial functions belonging to\nQ[d1, ..., dr, x1, ..., xn\u22122, y1, ..., yn\u22122].\nThen Vb is irreducible.\n3. Connectedness and quadratic solvability\nThe most tractable Laman graphs from the perspective of solvability are those\nwhich we term quadratically solvable. These are graphs whose zeros can be obtained\nby the successive solving of a sequence of quadratic equations where the coefficients\nin an equation may depend on the solution to preceding equations in the sequence.\nIn this section we describe an (infinite) class of graphs which are quadratically\nsolvable. Our conjecture that a generic 3-connected graph is not quadratically\nsoluble implies that this class exhausts all such graphs.\nDefinition 3.1. Let G be a maximally independent graph and let V be the variety\ndefined by the constraint equations with generic normalised distances {de}.\n(i) The graph G is said to be (generically) quadratically soluble (or simply QS)\nif there is a Galois extension of the base field Q({de}) with degree 2n for some n\nwhich contains every coordinate of every point of V\n(ii) The graph G is said to be soluble by radicals (or RS), or, simply, soluble, if\nevery such coordinate lies in a radical extension of the base field.\nOne could equally well define what it means for a specific distance-specified\ngraph to be QS or RS. For example it would be of interest to know if particular\ngraphs with integral distances are soluble. Such problems lead rapidly into arith-\nmetical problems associated with multi-variable diophantine analysis and, with the\nexception of some considerations of integral doublets, we shall not address such\nnon-generic issues.\nThe field Q({de}) is the field of fractions of polynomials in the distances. An\nirreducible quadratic polynomial over this base field determines a field extension of\ndegree 2, and so a sequence of n irreducible quadratic polynomials, with coefficients\nin the new fields, give rise to a final field extension of degree 2n. (In fact any Galois\nfield extension of this degree arises in this way.) It follows that if a maximally\nindependent planar graph G is constructed through a sequence of triangles joined\nat common edges, then G is QS. However, as is evident from Figure 3, not all QS\ngraphs are triangulated in this way.\nRecall that a graph G is n-connected if there does not exist a separation set with\nn \u2212 1 vertices. Thus the doublet is 3-connected, while the graph of Figure 3 is 2-\nconnected. The following sufficient condition for quadratic solubility was obtained\nby Owen [12].\nTheorem 3.2. A Laman graph is (generically) QS if it admits a reduction to tri-\nangle graphs by a process of repeated separation at two-point separation pairs. If the\nseparation pair is joined by an edge, then this edge is duplicated into each separation\ncomponent. Otherwise, a new virtual edge is added between the separation pair in\nall but one of the separation components (the non-rigid ones).\nIn the statement of this theorem, a triangle graph is the complete graph with\nthree vertices and three edges. Each edge may be either an edge of the original\ngraph or a virtual edge deriving from a previous separation. It is straightforward to\n2278 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\n1 2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n7\nFigure 3. A QS graph and its reduction to triangles.\nshow that after the addition of the virtual edges following a separation each of the\ncomponents is again a Laman graph with fewer vertices than the original. Clearly\nthis separation procedure terminates when a component graph is either a triangle\ngraph or is a 3-connected Laman graph.\nIf the procedure terminates in only triangle graphs, then a zero for the composite\ngraph is obtained by solving for the triangles in the reverse order to which they\nwere created. It is clear that there are at least two triangle graphs consisting\nof original edges (they arise from the final separation) which can be solved by\nquadratic equations. The triangles are positioned together sequentially (using rigid\nbody motion which involves only linear equations) in the reverse order to which\nthey were created. The distance value to be used for any virtual edge arising in the\nreverse order solving can be measured from points already computed since at least\none of the components created at the separation pair corresponding to the virtual\nedge did not have a virtual edge added, and the solving order can be arranged so\nthat this component is computed first.\nNote that the graph in Figure 3 can be reduced to a collection of triangles in\nthe manner of Theorem 3.2. The central triangle arises from new virtual edges\nand numbers represent a possible solving sequence. Graphs which are not algo-\nrithmically reducible in this way of necessity gives rise to a Laman graph which\nis 3-connected. Thus the main theorem of the present paper provides a converse\nto Owen\u2019s theorem in the case of graphs with a planar embedding; algorithmic\nreducibility of a planar CAD graph is a necessary condition to be (generically) QS\nor RS.\nAn alternative non-recursive way to express a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor quadratic solvability is obtained by introducing the notion of a rigidly induced\ngraph as follows.\nDefinition 3.3. A graph R is a rigidly induced graph of G if the vertices of R\nare a subset of the vertices of G and every edge (xy) of R corresponds either to\nan edge of G or to a maximally independent subgraph Gxy of G which contains\nthe vertices x and y. Moreover the vertex sets V (Gxy)\\{x, y} are required to be\npairwise disjoint.\nNow the absence of certain rigidly induced graphs provides a sufficient condition\nfor a graph to be quadratically (and thus radically) solvable, and our conjecture\nfollowing Theorem 1.1 asserts that this condition is also necessary.\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2279\nTheorem 3.4. (i) A generic Laman graph is QS (and thus RS) if it has no rigidly\ninduced graph that is 3-connected and maximally independent.\nFurthermore, the following two assertions are equivalent:\n(ii) A generic Laman graph is QS (respectively RS) only if it has no rigidly\ninduced graph that is 3-connected and maximally independent.\n(iii) Every generic 3-connected Laman graph is not QS (not RS).\nProof. (i) We claim that every graph R which occurs in the recursive algorithm\nof Theorem 3.2 is a maximally independent, rigidly induced graph of G. Suppose\nthat after a number of separations every graph R is a rigidly induced graph of G\nand suppose that R separates at the vertex pair x, y into components Ri. If (xy)\nis an edge of G, then each Ri is also a maximally independent, rigidly induced\ngraph of G. Otherwise some component Rj is maximally independent, and all\nof the other components are maximally independent after the addition of a new\nvirtual edge (xy) which can be associated with the component Rj . All of the\nRi\\{xy} are disjoint and remain disjoint when the subgraphs corresponding to all\nof their existing virtual edges are included. Thus all the Ri plus new virtual edges\nare maximally independent, rigidly induced graphs of G, and the claim follows by\ninduction.\nIf G has no 3-connected, maximally independent, rigidly induced graphs, then\nnone of the graphs in Theorem 3.2 can be 3-connected, so the algorithm terminates\non triangle graphs and G is QS.\n(iii) implies (ii). If G has a generic, maximally independent subgraph Gxy, then\nby Theorem 2.3 the distance |x \u2212 y| is generic over Q, and so to any maximally\nindependent, 3-connected rigidly induced graph of G there corresponds a similar\n3-connected maximally independent graph with generic edges which is certainly QS\n(RS) if G is QS (RS). This contradicts (iii).\n(ii) implies (iii) is trivial because every graph induces itself as a rigidly induced\ngraph. \u0001\n4. 3-connected maximally independent graphs\nWe now embark on a graph-theoretic analysis of maximally independent, 3-\nconnected, planar graphs. We shall prove the following main graph reduction the-\norem.\nTheorem 4.1. Let G be a 3-connected, maximally independent, planar graph with\n|G| > 6. Then G has either\n(i) an edge which can be contracted to give a 3-connected, maximally indepen-\ndent planar graph with |G| \u2212 1 vertices, or\n(ii) a proper vertex-induced subgraph with three vertices of attachment which is\nmaximally independent.\nWe begin by stating some definitions and properties from graph theory.\nThe order of a graph G, denoted |G|, is the number of vertices in G. The degree\nof a vertex v in G, denoted deg(v), is the number of edges of G which are incident\nto v or equivalently the number of neighbours of v in G. An edge joining vertices\nx and y is denoted by (xy).\nIt is assumed throughout this section that all graphs G have |G| \u2265 2, and if H\nis described as a subgraph of G, then also |H| \u2265 2, unless it is explicitly stated\notherwise. A vertex-induced subgraph H of G has the additional property that if\n2280 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nvertices x and y are in H and the edge (xy) is in G, then the edge (xy) is also in\nH.\nLet H be a graph or a subgraph with v vertices and e edges. Define the freedom\nnumber of H, written free(H), to be 2v \u2212 e \u2212 3. A graph G is independent if\nall its subgraphs H have the property free(H) \u2265 0. The graph G is maximally\nindependent if it is independent and free(G) = 0.\nThe graph G\\e is the graph G with the edge e deleted. If G is independent, then\nG\\e is also independent and free(G\\e) = free(G) + 1.\nThe graph G\/e is the graph obtained from G by contracting the edge e. This\nmeans that if the edge e joins vertices x and y, then G\/e is obtained from G by\ndeleting the edge e, merging the vertices x and y, and reducing any resulting double\nedges to single edges. Any such double edge must derive from a 3-cycle in G that\ncontains the contracted edge e. Thus |G\/e| = |G| \u2212 1 and if the edge e is in a total\nof c 3-cycles of G, then free(G\/e) = free(G) + c\u2212 1.\nAn edge e in an independent graph G is said to be contractible if G\/e is indepen-\ndent and free(G\/e) = free(G). A necessary condition for e to be contractible is\nthus that it is in exactly one 3-cycle of G. However, this condition is not sufficient\nas we show in Lemma 4.5 below.\nIf H is a vertex-induced subgraph of G, then G\\H is the subgraph of G induced\nby the vertices of G that are not in H. Here |G\\H| < 2 is not excluded. Thus\n|G| = |H| + |G\\H|. The vertices of H that have neighbours in G\\H are the\nvertices of attachment of H in G. A vertex-induced subgraph H with v vertices of\nattachment is described as proper if |H| > v. An internal vertex of H is a vertex of\nH that is not a vertex of attachment. An internal edge of H is an edge that joins\nto at least one internal vertex.\nAll vertices v of a 3-connected graph G with |G| > 3 have deg(v) \u2265 3. The 3-\ncycle is the only 3-connected graph with |G| < 4. If G is 3-connected and |G| > 3,\nthen any pair of vertices in G are joined by at least 3 paths which are internally\ndisjoint. We call such paths independent.\nWe shall say that a graph is planar if it has a planar embedding. A planar\nembedding of a 2-connected graph G, |G| > 2, divides the plane into disjoint regions\ncalled faces. One of these faces includes the points at infinity. Each face is bounded\nby a cycle of edges in G.\nThere are certain subgraphs whose occurrence is enough to ensure that the graph\nresulting from an edge contraction is definitely not 3-connected. The simplest of\nthese consists of a 3-cycle connected into the remaining graph by exactly three\nedges as shown in Figure 4. We call this subgraph the limpet.\nIf a graph G contains a limpet, then G also contains a subgraph H with three\nvertices of attachment in G, where H is the subgraph induced by all vertices of G\nthat are not in the 3-cycle of the limpet. Clearly, |H| = |G|\u22123 and H has 6 less edges\nthan G, so if G is maximally independent, then H is also maximally independent.\nIf G = 6, then G is the doublet. If |G| > 6, then H is a proper vertex-induced\nsubgraph of G with 3 vertices of attachment that is maximally independent.\nThe blocking role of the limpet should be clear by observing that attaching the\nlimpet by two vertices of attachment to any contractible edge in a 3-connected\ngraph and assigning the third vertex of attachment to any other vertex gives a\n3-connected graph for which the result of contracting that same edge is definitely\nnot 3-connected. This is shown in Figure 5. By adding limpets into a graph in this\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2281\nFigure 4. The limpet subgraph.\nFigure 5. Adding a limpet subgraph to an edge contraction.\nway it is easy to generate graphs, all of whose contractible edges produce graphs\nthat are not 3-connected. Case (ii) of Theorem 4.1 is needed to deal with limpets.\nWe are now in a position to prove the main theorem of this section using the\nsequence of lemmas proved below. To give some motivation to these lemmas we\nbegin with the proof of the main theorem.\n2282 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nProof of Theorem 4.1. Suppose that G has no proper vertex-induced subgraph with\nthree vertices of attachment that is maximally independent.\nAssume for the sake of a proof by contradiction that G contains no edge e such\nthat G\/e is 3-connected and maximally independent.\nG is not the doublet because |G| > 6, and G has no limpets because it is maxi-\nmally independent and has no proper vertex-induced subgraph which is maximally\nindependent with three vertices of attachment.\nBy Lemma 4.7, G has no degree-3 vertex on a 3-cycle.\nBy Corollary 4.12, G contains an edge e joining vertices x and y such that G\/e\nis maximally independent. Then G\/e is not 3-connected, by the assumption, and\nby Lemma 4.17, G has a 3-vertex separation set (x, y, w) for some w, and this set\nseparates G into 2 proper components H1 and H2. Let H = H1 if |H1| < |H2|,\notherwise H = H2. Now chose e in G which gives a minimal value for |H|.\nBy Lemmas 4.17 and 4.16 , the subgraph H contains an edge k which is internal\nto H and which is contractible as an edge in G. Thus G\/k is not 3-connected\nby the assumption. By Lemma 4.18, k generates a 3-vertex separation set which\nhas one proper component properly contained in H. This contradicts the minimal\ncondition on |H| and completes the proof. \u0001\nThis proof requires a number of lemmas which deal with the effect of an edge\ncontraction on both maximal independence and 3-connectivity. The apparent com-\nplexity of the proof, including the lemmas, is a result of the need to find edge\ncontractions which maintain both of these properties simultaneously.\nThe first three lemmas give some useful properties of maximally independent\ngraphs and subgraphs.\nLemma 4.2. Let H1 and H2 be maximally independent subgraphs of an independent\ngraph G with |H1 \u2229 H2| \u2265 2. Then H1 \u222a H2 and H1 \u2229 H2 are both maximally\nindependent.\nProof. H1\u222aH2 and H1\u2229H2 are both subgraphs of G so they are both independent.\nLet H1, H2, H1 \u222aH2 and H1 \u2229H2 have v1, v2, vu, vi and e1, e2, eu, ei vertices and\nedges respectively. We have\n2v1 \u2212 e1 \u2212 3 = 0, 2v2 \u2212 e2 \u2212 3 = 0, vu = v1 + v2 \u2212 vi, eu = e1 + e2 \u2212 ei.\nThus free(H1 \u222aH2) = 2vu \u2212 eu \u2212 3 = 3\u2212 2vi + ei = \u2212 free(H1 \u2229H2).\nSince both H1\u222aH2 and H1\u2229H2 are independent they both have freedom numbers\ngreater than or equal to zero and thus equal to zero. \u0001\nLemma 4.3. Let G be a maximally independent graph. Then G is 2-connected.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary. Then there exist vertex-induced subgraphs H1 and\nH2 such that G = H1 \u222a H2 and |H1 \u2229 H2| = 1. Using the same notation as for\nLemma 4.2 we have\nfree(G) = 2vu \u2212 eu \u2212 3 \u2265 2(v1 + v2 \u2212 1)\u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 3 = 1,\nwhich contradicts the fact that G is maximally independent. \u0001\nLemma 4.4. Let G be a maximally independent graph. Then for any edge e the\ncontraction G\/e has at most one separation vertex.\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2283\nProof. Suppose the edge e joins vertices (x, y) in G which become the vertex w\nin G\/e. Then any separation vertex of G\/e which is different from w is also a\nseparation vertex of G contrary to Lemma 4.3. \u0001\nThe next lemma gives a useful criterion for an edge to be contractible.\nLemma 4.5. Let G be an independent graph. An edge e = (xy) of G is contractible\nif and only if\n(i) e is on exactly one 3-cycle (x, y, z) of G, and\n(ii) there is no maximally independent subgraph R of G, |R| \u2265 3, such that x\nand y are in R and z is not in R.\nCondition (i) can be replaced with the weaker condition\n(i\u2032) e is on one or more 3-cycles of G.\nProof. By definition e is contractible if and only if free(G\/e) = free(G) and G\/e\nis independent. We show that the first of these conditions is equivalent to (i) and\nthe second equivalent to (ii).\nIf e is on c 3-cycles, then free(G\/e) = free(G)+c+1\u22122, so free(G\/e) = free(G)\nif and only if c = 1.\nNow suppose (i) is true and (ii) is false. Then there is a maximally independent\nsubgraph R of G such that x,y are in R and z is not in R. We have free(R) = 0\nand R contains e, but not z. Thus free(R\/e) = \u22121 (because R contains no 3-cycle\ncontaining e), so G\/e is not independent.\nConversely, suppose G\/e is not independent. Then G\/e contains a subgraph, say\nR\/e, with free(R\/e) = \u22121 (since contracting an edge reduces free(H) by at most\n1 for any subgraph H of G). R\/e must contain the edge e (or R\/e would also be\na subgraph of G), so R\/e does indeed derive from a subgraph R in G following\ncontraction of e. Thus R contains vertices x and y and free(R) = 0. The vertex z\ncannot be in R because this would give free(R\/e) = 0.\nClearly (i) implies (i\u2032). Also (i\u2032) and (ii) imply (i) because if e is on two or more\n3-cycles, then one of these contains a vertex w different from z and the 3-cycle\n(w, x, y) gives a subgraph R which violates (ii). \u0001\nThe next lemma is standard graph theory [3] and describes what happens if the\nresult of an edge contraction in a 3-connected graph is not 3-connected.\nLemma 4.6. Let G be a 3-connected graph. For any edge e joining vertices x and\ny, either G\/e is 3-connected or G has a 3-vertex separation set consisting of x, y\nand another vertex w of G.\nProof. Let v be the vertex in G\/e that results from contracting e and identifying\nx and y in G. If G\/e is not 3-connected, then it contains a separation pair (a,w)\nand a = v because G is 3-connected. Thus (v, w) separates G\/e for some w, and\n(x, y, w) separates G. \u0001\nThe next lemma identifies a class of 3-connected independent graphs that always\nhave a contractible edge whose contraction gives a 3-connected graph. These are\ngraphs that contain a 3-cycle with one or two vertices with degree 3. Eliminating\nthese graphs is helpful because the remaining graphs with a 3-cycle either contain\na limpet or have all vertices on the 3-cycle with at least two additional neighbours.\n2284 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nCt\nx\ny\nz\nt\nw\nG\nFigure 6. G\/(xy) is 2-connected. The separation set (x, y, w) in\nG gives two separation components.\nLemma 4.7. Let G be a 3-connected, independent graph with no contractible edges\nwhose contraction gives a 3-connected graph. Then any 3-cycle in G either has all\nits vertices with degree 3 or none of its vertices with degree 3.\nProof. Suppose that G contains a 3-cycle (x, y, z) with deg(x) = 3. Let the third\nneighbour of x be t. We will show that deg(y) = deg(z) = 3.\nWe claim that both (xy) and (xz) are contractible.\nSuppose that neither (xy) nor (xz) is contractible. By Lemma 4.5 there is a\nmaximally independent subgraph Rxy containing (xy) and not containing z with\n|Rxy| \u2265 3, and a maximally independent subgraph Rxz containing (xz) and not\ncontaining y with |Rxz| \u2265 3. By Lemma 4.3 the vertex x has at least two neigh-\nbours in Rxywhich must be y and t, and at least two neighbours in Rxz which\nmust be z and t. Thus Rxy \u2229 Rxz contains the vertices x and t, so Rxy \u222a Rxz is\nmaximally independent by Lemma 4.2. Then the subgraph Rxy \u222a Rxz + (yz) has\nfreedom number \u22121 (since (yz) is in neither Rxy nor Rxz) which contradicts the\nindependence of G.\nNow suppose that (xy) is contractible and that (xz) is not. Then G\/(xy) is not\n3-connected, so there exists a separation set (x, y, w) of G. Since G is 3-connected\neach separation component contains a vertex connected to x, so there are just two\nseparation components Cz containing z and Ct containing t, and w is distinct from\nt and z. This is shown in Figure 6. Then all paths from x to z in G include the\nedge (xz) or include the vertex y or include both the vertices t and w. If (xz) is\nnot contractible there exists maximally independent Rxz which includes x and z\nbut not y. But then all paths from x to z in Rxz\/(xz) include both t and w, so t\nand w are two separation vertices for Rxz\/(xz) which contradicts Lemma 4.4.\nWe can now suppose that both (xy) and (xz) are contractible and neither G\/(xy)\nnor G\/(xz) is 3-connected. Then G has a separation set (x, y, w) with a component\nCt which contains the vertex t and not the vertex z. G also has a separation set\n(x, z, w\u2032) with a component C \u2032t which contains the vertex t and not the vertex y.\nSince t and y are in different components of the separation set (x, z, w\u2032), all paths\nfrom t to y contain either x, z or w\u2032. The vertex set (x, y, w) also separates G and\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2285\nCt\nx\ny\nz\nt\nw\nw'\nFigure 7.

Neither z nor x is inside Ct, so w\u2032 is in Ct and w\u2032 separates y from t\ninside Ct. Since G is 3-connected this implies that the vertex y is connected by the\nsingle edge (yw\u2032) to w\u2032 in Ct. Similarly w is in C \u2032t and the vertex z is connected by\nthe single edge (zw) to w in C \u2032t. This is shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8.\n2286 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nSuppose that y has a neighbour v in addition to x, z and w\u2032. Then v is not\nin Ct and v is not in C \u2032t, because y is not in C\n\u2032\nt, and v and y are both distinct\nfrom (x, z, w\u2032). Since t is in Ct all paths from v to t include one on the separation\nset (x, y, w) before any other vertices of Ct. The vertex x is connected only to z\noutside Ct, so a path including x includes z. The vertex w is separated from v by\nthe separation set (x, z, w\u2032), and of these vertices only z is outside Ct, so a path\nincluding w includes z. Then all paths from v to t include either y or z, which\ncontradicts the fact that G is 3-connected.\nWe conclude that deg(y) = 3 and similarly deg(z) = 3. \u0001\nThe remaining lemmas make use of planarity in order to simplify certain decom-\npositions and to ensure a supply of contractible edges. The first of these lemmas\nmakes use of the Kuratowski theorem [3] to simplify the number of separation\ncomponents if the result of contracting an edge is not 3-connected.\nLemma 4.8. Let G be a 3-connected, planar graph with a 3-vertex separation set.\nThen this separation set divides G into exactly 2 proper components.\nProof. The separation set divides G into at least 2 proper components by definition.\nSuppose for a contradiction that there are 3 or more proper separation components.\nThen we can identify 3 vertices w1, w2, and w3, each internal to a different sepa-\nration component. Let the separation set be the vertices v1, v2 and v3. There are\npaths connecting each of the wi to each of the vj. By Menger\u2019s theorem, the 3 paths\nfrom a wi to each of the three vj can be selected to be internally disjoint because\nG is 3-connected and the paths from different wi to any vj are internally disjoint\nbecause they are in different separation components. Thus G contains K(3, 3) as a\ntopological minor contrary to Kuratowski\u2019s theorem. \u0001\nThe next two lemmas lead to Corollary 4.12 that states that every maximally\nindependent, planar graph has at least 3 contractible edges. Lemma 4.11 is stronger\nthan is required for this corollary, but the greater detail will be useful subsequently.\nLemma 4.9. Let G, |G| > 2, be a 2-connected planar graph with freedom number\nf . Then every planar embedding of G has the property\n2(f \u2212 1) =\n\u2211\ni\n(ni(i\u2212 4))\nwhere the embedding has ni faces with i edges.\nProof. It is a standard result of graph theory [3] that every planar embedding of\na 2-connected graph divides the plane into disjoint faces with each edge in exactly\ntwo faces. Let G have n vertices and e edges and let the planar embedding have F\nfaces. From Euler\u2019s relation F +n = e+2 and from the definition, f = 2n\u2212 e\u2212 3,\nso f = e \u2212 2F + 1. By definition F = \u2211i(ni). Each edge is in 2 faces of the\nplanar embedding so 2e =\n\u2211\ni(i(ni)), and the result follows by substituting into\nf = e\u2212 2F + 1. \u0001\nCorollary 4.10. A maximally independent, planar graph G, |G| > 2, contains at\nleast one 3-cycle.\nProof. A maximally independent graph has f = 0 and is 2-connected by Lemma\n4.3. Thus in Lemma 4.9 n3 \u2265 2, and the boundary of one of these faces is a 3-cycle\nof G. \u0001\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2287\nLemma 4.11. Let G be an independent, planar graph which contains a 3-cycle\n(x, y, z), and let (i, j, k) be any permutation of (x, y, z).\n(i) There exists a maximally independent subgraph Rij of G with i and j in Rij\nand k not in Rij, such that Rij contains an edge eij which is contractible\nin G, and\n(ii) Rij \u2229Rjk = j.\nProof. Define the Rij as follows: If the edge (ij) is contractible, then Rij = (ij).\nOtherwise, by Lemma 4.5 let Rij be a maximally independent subgraph containing\ni and j but not k with |Rij | \u2265 3. Additionally take Rij to be a maximal subgraph\nwith these properties (maximal in the sense that there is no subgraph F with these\nproperties and H \u2286 F ).\nWith this definition it is clear that j is in Rij \u2229 Rjk. If |Rij \u2229 Rjk| \u2265 2, then\nfree(Rij \u222a Rjk) = 0 by Lemma 4.2. The vertices i and k are in Rij \u222a Rjk but\nthe edge (ik) is not in Rij \u222a Rjk, so the subgraph Rij \u222a Rjk + (ik) of G would\nhave freedom number \u22121 which contradicts the fact that G is independent. Thus\n|Rij \u2229Rjk| = 1 and Rij \u2229Rjk = j.\nIt remains to show that each Rij contains a contractible edge which we do by\ninduction. This is true for |G| = 3. Assume it is true for |G| = N .\nSince every maximally independent planar graph contains a 3-cycle (Corollary\n4.10), it follows from the hypotheses that every maximally independent, planar\ngraph R with 3 \u2264 |R| \u2264 N has at least 3 contractible edges. Thus if (ij) is not\ncontractible, then each Rij contains at least 3 edges which are contractible as edges\nin Rij and one of these, say edge eij , is different from (ij).\nWe claim that each eij is also contractible as an edge in G. Otherwise there exists\na maximally independent subgraph H in G, not contained in Rij but also containing\neij . In fact H \u2229 Rij = eij , because otherwise H \u2229 Rij would be a maximally\nindependent subgraph of Rij (by Lemma 4.2), containing eij with |H \u2229 Rij | \u2265 3,\nwhich contradicts the contractibility of eij in Rij . Now H \u222a Rij is also maximally\nindependent by Lemma 4.2 and |H\u222aRij | > |Rij |, which contradicts the maximality\nof Rij unless k is in H \u222aRij . Suppose k is in |H \u222aRij |. Then the independence of\nthe subgraph H \u222aRij + (ik) + (jk) in G requires (ik) and (jk) in H (since k is not\nin Rij). But i and j are in Rij and H \u2229Rij = eij , which would require eij = (ij),\ncontrary to the assumption that eij and the edge (ij) are distinct. \u0001\nCorollary 4.12. Every maximally independent, planar graph G has at least 3\ncontractible edges.\nProof. This was proved in Lemma 4.11. \u0001\nThe next lemma guarantees the existence of a contractible edge in certain sub-\ngraphs of an independent, planar graph.\nLemma 4.13. Let H be a subgraph with 3 vertices of attachment in an independent,\nplanar graph G. If H contains a 3-cycle with at least one vertex internal to H, then\nH has an internal edge that is contractible as an edge of G.\nProof. Let the 3-cycle be (x, y, z) with internal vertex x. By Lemma 4.11 there\nexist maximally independent subgraphs Rxy and Rxz containing (xy) and (xz)\nrespectively, and each of these contains a contractible edge.\nWe claim that either Rxy or Rxz have all their edges internal to H. Otherwise\nboth Rxy and Rxz each contain at least two vertices of connection, since if say Rxy\n2288 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\ncontains no vertex of connection it is internal to H, and if it contains one vertex of\nconnection, then either all its edges are internal to H or Rxy contains a vertex of\nG\/H. Then the vertex of connection would be a separating vertex for Rxy, which\ncontradicts Lemma 4.3. But if Rxy and Rxz each contain at least two out of the\nthree vertices of connection, then one of these vertices must be in both Rxy and\nRxz and thus equal to the vertex x since Rxy \u2229 Rxz = x. This contradicts the\nrequirement that x is internal to H. \u0001\nThe next sequence of lemmas has implications for 3-connected maximally inde-\npendent planar graphs for which the contraction of any contractible edge gives a\ngraph which is not 3-connected. We have already shown that such a graph has a\n3-vertex separation set with exactly two components. The critical case for the proof\nof Theorem 4.1 is when each component has freedom number 1. The difficulty is\nto show that each of these components contains a 3-cycle so that a reduction ar-\ngument can be applied to the smaller of the two components. Lemma 4.9 alone is\nnot sufficient because substituting f = 1 into this lemma leaves the possibility that\nall faces have exactly 4 edges. We exclude this possibility by showing that at least\none face has at least 5 edges.\nLemma 4.14. Let G be a 3-connected graph and let H be a proper vertex-induced\nsubgraph of G with 3 vertices of attachment. If each vertex of attachment has at\nleast 2 neighbours in H, then H is 2-connected.\nProof. Suppose to the contrary that H has a separation vertex w. All three vertices\nof attachment cannot be in the same separation component of w because G is 2-\nconnected. Thus there is a separation component for w which contains exactly one\nvertex of attachment, say v1, and this component must be just the edge (wv1) or\nelse (w, v1) would be a separation pair for G. This contradicts the requirement that\nv1 has at least 2 neighbours in H. \u0001\nLemma 4.15. Let G be a 3-connected planar graph, let H be a proper vertex-\ninduced subgraph of G with 3 vertices of attachment and let each vertex of attach-\nment have at least 2 neighbours in H. Then a planar embedding of G implies a\nplanar embedding of H, and this embedding of H has the three vertices of attach-\nment in one face boundary.\nProof. G has a planar embedding, and deleting G\/H plus any edges connected to\nG\/H gives a planar embedding of H. By Lemma 4.14 H is 2-connected, so the\nplanar embedding of H divides the plane into disjoint faces.\nThe three vertices of attachment of H in G are a separation set for G. We claim\nthat all vertices of G\/H lie in the same face with respect to the embedding of\nH. By Lemma 4.8 the 3-vertex separation set divides G into exactly 2 separation\ncomponents. Thus every pair of vertices in G\/H is joined together by a path in\nG\/H. All vertices of G\/H are therefore embedded in the same face of the embedding\nof H, because otherwise these paths would cross a face boundary of the embedding\nof H, and these face boundaries lie in H. There is a vertex of G\/H adjacent to\neach of the three separation vertices, so the three separation vertices lie on this face\nboundary. \u0001\nLemma 4.16. Let G be a 3-connected, independent, planar graph, let H be a\nproper vertex-induced subgraph of G with 3 vertices of attachment (v1, v2 and v3)\nand let each vertex of attachment have at least 2 neighbours in H. If H has freedom\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2289\nnumber 1 and if H contains at most one of the edges (v1v2), (v2v3) or (v3v1), then\nH contains an edge adjacent to an interior vertex of H that is contractible as an\nedge of G.\nProof. A planar embedding of G gives a planar embedding of H. By Lemma 4.14\nH is 2-connected, and by Lemma 4.15 one of the face boundaries contains v1, v2\nand v3. Since H contains at most one of the edges (v1v2), (v2v3) or (v3v1) this face\nboundary has at least 5 edges, so by Lemma 4.9 with f = 1 the embedding of H\nhas at least one face with 3 edges and so H contains a 3-cycle. Since H has at most\none of the edges (v1v2), (v2v3) or (v3v1), H has a 3-cycle with an interior vertex,\nand by Lemma 4.13 H contains an edge adjacent to an interior vertex of H that is\ncontractible as an edge of G. \u0001\nLemma 4.17. Let G be a 3-connected, maximally independent planar graph that\ncontains no maximally independent vertex-induced subgraph with 3 vertices of at-\ntachment and which has no degree-3 vertex on a 3-cycle. For any contractible edge\ne joining vertices x and y, either G\/e is 3-connected or G has a 3-vertex separation\nset consisting of x, y and another vertex w of G with the following properties:\n1. G does not contain edges (xw) or (yw).\n2. The separation set divides G into exactly 2 proper components such that each\nproper component plus the edge (xy) has freedom number 1.\n3. w has at least 2 neighbours in each of the two proper components.\nProof. Suppose G\/e is not 3-connected. By Lemmas 4.6 and 4.8 G has a 3-vertex\nseparation set (x, y, w) which separates G into exactly 2 proper components, C1\nand C2. Let H1 = C1 + (xy) + (xw)\u2032 + (yw)\u2032 and H2 = C2 + (xy) + (xw)\u2032 + (yw)\u2032\n, where (xw)\u2032 = (xw) only if the edge (xw) is in G and similarly for (yw)\u2032. Let G,\nH1 and H2 have v, v1, v2 and e, e1, e2 edges and vertices, respectively. Let d = 0, 1\nor 2 if none, one or both of (xw) and (yw) is in G and let H1 and H2 have freedom\nnumbers f1 and f2. We have\nv = v1 + v2 \u2212 3, e = e1 + e2 \u2212 1\u2212 d, 2v \u2212 e\u2212 3 = 0,\nf1 = 2v1 \u2212 e1 \u2212 3, f2 = 2v2 \u2212 e2 \u2212 3.\nThus 2(v1 + v2 \u2212 3)\u2212 (e1 + e2 \u2212 1\u2212 d)\u2212 3 = 0, and so f1 + f2 = 2\u2212 d.\nBy hypothesis neither H1 nor H2 is maximally independent, so f1 > 0 and\nf2 > 0. This requires f1 = 1, f2 = 1 and d = 0.\nSuppose a component, say C1, has only vertex a adjacent to w. Then H1 \u2212w\u2212\n(aw) has freedom number 0 and 3 vertices of attachment in G. H1 \u2212 w \u2212 (aw)\nis not the 3-cycle because w would be a degree-3 vertex on a 3-cycle contrary to\nhypothesis, so H1 \u2212 w \u2212 (aw) is a proper maximally independent vertex-induced\nsubgraph of G, contrary to hypothesis. \u0001\nThe final lemma allows us to conclude that under certain conditions one of the\nseparation components that can result from contracting an edge in a subgraph must\nlie entirely within that subgraph.\nLemma 4.18. Let G be a 3-connected graph, let H be a proper vertex-induced\nsubgraph of G with 3 vertices of attachment v1, v2 and v3 such that G has the edge\n(v1v2) and does not have the edge (v2v3) or the edge (v1v3) and let v3 have at least\n2 neighbours in the subgraph induced by the vertices of G\\H + v1 + v2 + v3.

Let the edge e join vertices x and y with vertex x interior to H. Suppose\nG\\e is not 3-connected. By Lemma 4.6 G has a 3-vertex separation set (x, y, w).\nSee Figure 9.\nWe claim that w is in H. Suppose to the contrary that w is in G\\H. Since v1\nand v2 are adjacent they are internal vertices of only one component, so there is\nanother component C that has either none of v1, v2 or v3 as an internal vertex or\ncontains v3 and not v1 and v2 as internal vertex. If C contains none of v1, v2 or\nv3, then there is a path in C from w in G\\H to x in H that avoids all vertices\nof attachment, contrary to the definition of vertices of attachment. Suppose C\ncontains v3 as an internal vertex and not v1 or v2. The vertex v3 has at least 2\nneighbours in G\\H (because it has at least 2 neighbours in G\\H + v1 + v2 + v3\nand G does not contain (v1v3) or (v2v3)), so there is a vertex u in G\\H that is a\nneighbour of v3 and is different from w. See Figure 10. Thus u is in (G\\H)\u2229C and\nis different from v1, v2, x, y and w. One of the vertices v1 or v2, say v1, is not x or\ny and is thus in G\\C. Now all paths from u to v1 include one of w, x or y before\nany vertices in G\\C. All paths in C from u to x or y contain v3, and thus all paths\nfrom u to v1 contain v3 or w, contradicting the fact that G is 3-connected.\nNow x, y and w are in H, and one vertex of attachment, say v1, is different from\nx, y and w. All vertices in G\\H are connected on paths excluding x, y and w, so\none separation component contains at least G\\H + v1 as internal vertices and so\nthe other component is properly contained in H. \u0001\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2291\nC\nH\nC, H\nx\ny\nG\nv1\nv2\nw v3\nFigure 10.

Plainly V (It) contains \u03c0t(V ), the projection of\nV onto the subspace Ct. The following fundamental closure theorem may be found\nin [4].\nTheorem 5.1. The variety V (It) is the Zariski closure of \u03c0t(V ), that is, the small-\nest affine variety containing \u03c0t(V ).\nLet {d} = {d1, . . . , dr} be complex numbers forming an algebrically independent\nset with field extension Q({d}).\nTheorem 5.2. Let {f} be a set of polynomials in Q[d1, . . . , dr][{x}] which generates\nan ideal I in C[{x}] whose complex variety V (I) has dimension zero. Then each\nelimination ideal\nIxi = I \u2229 C[xi],\n2292 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nfor i = 1, . . . , n, is generated by a polynomial gi with coefficients in Q[d1, . . . , dr]\nand deg(gi) > 0. If, in addition, the set {f} generates a prime ideal in the polyno-\nmial ring Q[d1, . . . , dr, x1, . . . , xn], then each gi may be chosen to be irreducible in\nQ[d1, . . . , dr, xi].\nProof. Let I\u02c6 denote the ideal in Q({di})[x1, . . . , xn] generated by {f} with elimi-\nnation ideals\n(I\u02c6)xi = I\u02c6 \u2229Q({d})[xi].\nPlainly, with the given inclusion Q({d}) \u2286 C we have I\u02c6 \u2286 I, and I is the ideal in\nC[x1, . . . , xn] generated by I\u02c6.\nSince (I\u02c6)xi is an ideal in Q({d})[xi] it is generated by a single polynomial gi,\nwhich is unique up to a non-zero multiplier in Q({d}). Since V (I) is nonempty gi\nis not a non-zero constant, and so if deg(gi) = 0, then gi = 0, and (I\u02c6)xi = {0}.\nHowever, in this case we deduce that Ixi = {0}. This follows, for example, from\nthe fact that a basis for Ixi may be derived from the generators of I by algebraic\noperations and so lie in (I\u02c6)xi . (Consider a Groebner basis construction for example.)\nIt now follows that V (Ixi) = C, and the closure theorem implies that the projection\n\u03c0xi(V ) of V (I) onto Cxi is infinite and hence that V (I) is infinite, contrary to\nhypothesis. Thus deg(gi) > 0.\nThe coefficients of gi are in Q({d}) and so are ratios of polynomials in Q[{d}].\nThus we may replace gi by p(d1, ..., dr)gi for some polynomial p to obtain the de-\nsired generator with polynomial coefficients. We may also arrange that the highest\ncommon factor of the coefficients of gi is 1.\nWe claim that the generator gi, when viewed as an element of the ring\nQ[{d}, {xi}], is also a generator for the polynomial ring elimination ideal\nJxi = J \u2229Q[{d}, xi],\nwhere J is the ideal in Q[{d}, {x}] generated by {f}.\nConsidering a Groebner basis construction of gi, one sees that there is a non-zero\npolynomial r(d1, ..., dr) such that r(d1, ..., dr)gi lies in Jxi . Since, by the hypotheses,\nthe ideal J is prime, so too is Jxi , and so one of the factors belongs to Jxi . However,\nif r(d1, ..., dr) belongs to Jxi , then it belongs to (I\u02c6)xi . This is impossible since (I\u02c6)xi\nis generated by gi, which has positive degree in xi. Hence gi is in Jxi . Now take\nany h in Jxi . Then h is also in (I\u02c6)xi , and so h = qgi with q in Q({d})[xi]. Clearing\nthe denominators of the coefficients of q gives the factorization r(d1, ..., dr)h =\n(r(d1, ..., dr)q)gi, where r(d1, ..., dr) is in Q[{d}] and r(d1, ..., dr)q is in Q[{d}][xi].\nSince the coefficients of gi have no common factor, it follows that r(d1, ..., dr) divides\nevery coefficient of r(d1, ..., dr)q, which proves that q lies in Q[{d}][xi]. This shows\nthat gi generates Jxi in Q[{d}][xi]. Since Jxi is prime this in turn entails that the\ngenerator gi is irreducible in Q[{d}, xi]. \u0001\nWe now show that in the case r = 1 the specialised generator g(d\u2032, xi) is non-zero\nand divisible by the generator gi(xi) of the elimination ideal of the specialised ideal.\nAs we note below, such divisibility may fail for a double specialisation!\nFor later convenience the role of Q in the theorem above is played below by\nE \u2286 C, a finite transcendental field extension of Q. (It is trivial to generalise the\ntheorem above with Q replaced by E.) Specialisation occurs for the single variable d\nassociated with the transcendental extension E(d). For an ideal I\u02c6 in E[d][x1, ..., xn]\nwe shall write (I\u02c6)\u2032 for the specialisation of I\u02c6 resulting from the substitution d\u2192 d\u2032.\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2293\nTheorem 5.3. Let {f} be a set of polynomials in E[d][x1, . . . , xn] which generate\nan ideal I\u02c6 in E(d)[x1, . . . , xn] and an ideal I in C[x1, . . . , xn] whose complex variety\nV (I) has dimension zero. Let d\u2032 \u2208 Q be a specialisation of d giving rise to the set\n{f \u2032} in E[x1, . . . , xn] with an ideal I \u2032 whose complex variety also has dimension\nzero.\nLet g(d, x1) in E[d][x1] and g\u2032(x1) in E[x1] be generators for the elimination\nideals Ix1 and (I\n\u2032)x1 , respectively, as provided by the previous theorem. Finally,\nassume that the ideal in E[d, x1, . . . , xn] generated by {f} is prime. Then\n(i) the specialisation ((I\u02c6)x1)\n\u2032 of (I\u02c6)x1 is contained in ((I\u02c6)\n\u2032)x1 ,\n(ii) the degree of g(d\u2032, x1) is greater than zero, and\n(iii) g\u2032(x1) divides g(d\u2032, x1).\nProof. We have\n((I\u02c6)x1)\n\u2032 = {p(d\u2032, x1) : p \u2208 I\u02c6 \u2229 E(d)[x1]}.\nBut if p(d, x1) \u2208 I\u02c6, then p(d\u2032, x1) \u2208 (I\u02c6)\u2032 and so ((I\u02c6)x1)\u2032 \u2286 ((I\u02c6)\u2032)x1 . Thus if g(d\u2032, x1)\nis not the zero polynomial, then g\u2032(x1) divides g(d\u2032, x1) and deg(g(d\u2032, x1)) > 0.\nLet J be the ideal in E[d, x1, ..., xn] generated by {f} and let Jd,x1 be the elimi-\nnation ideal J \u2229E[d, x1]. Then Jd,x1 has generator g1(d, x1) where this polynomial\nis the generator of (I\u02c6)x1 in E(d)[x1] provided by the previous theorem. By this\ntheorem we may assume that g1(d, x1) is irreducible in E[d, x1]. In this case it is\nnot possible to have g1(d\u2032, x1) = 0 for all x1, for otherwise g1 would have a proper\nfactor (d\u2212 d\u2032). \u0001\nIt is instructive to note that Theorem 5.3 is not valid without the assumption\nthat the big ideal is prime. Consider the equation set\n(dx\u2212 1)p(x) = 0, d(dx\u2212 1) = 0,\nwhere p(x) is a polynomial in one variable x over Q and d is a single parameter.\nFor generic d the ideal I = \u3008(dx \u2212 1)p(x), d(dx \u2212 1)\u3009 in Q[x] is the principal ideal\n\u3008dx \u2212 1\u3009, V (I) is the singleton {1\/d} and dim(V (I)) = 0. For the specialisation\nd = 0 the ideal for the specialised equations is I \u2032 = \u3008p(x)\u3009 and V (I \u2032) is the finite set\nof zeros of p and so is also zero dimensional. However, it is not possible to choose\na generator for I \u2032 which divides a non-zero generator of I, and so the conclusion of\nTheorem 5.3 cannot hold for this equation set.\nNote also that in this example we may choose p(x) to be a polynomial which is\nnot soluble over Q, so that while the generic variety V (I) is radical the variety for\nthe specialised equations is not radical.\nIt is also instructive to note that Theorem 5.3 is not valid for the specialisation\nof more than one parameter. For example, let\nf1 = x1(1\u2212 x1x2)\u2212 d1, f2 = x2(1\u2212 x1x2)\u2212 d2, f3 = x3(1\u2212 x1x2)\u2212 d3.\nFor the double specialisation d1 = d2 = 0, V (I \u2032) is the single point x1 = 0, x2 =\n0, x3 = d3 and\ng1(d1, d2, x1) = d2x31 \u2212 d1x1 + d21\nwhich becomes zero on this specialisation.\n2294 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\n6. The reduction step\nEquipped with the elimination theory of the last section we are now able to prove\nthe reduction step stated in the Introduction.\nLet G be a maximally independent graph with n vertices and r + 1 edges and\nsuppose that G has an edge contraction to a maximally independent graph G\/e. We\nlabel the vertices so that e is the edge (vn\u22121vn\u22122), e is in the 3-cycle (vn, vn\u22121, vn\u22122)\nand we regard (vn\u22121vn) as the base edge. Furthermore, we normalise the constraint\nequations {fe} so that the coordinates for the base vertices are (xn\u22121, yn\u22121) =\n(0, 0), (xn, yn) = (1, 0). Let us label edges so that the contractible edge e is the rth\nedge, with the associated (squared) distance dr, and the edge (vn\u22122vn) has distance\ndr\u22121. Finally let f1, ..., fr be a listing of the normalised constraint equations for G\ncompatible with this notation.\nNow consider a set of normalised constraint equations for the contracted graph\nG\/e. We lose two edges from G (edge r \u2212 1 and edge r), and we can take the\nnormalised constraint equations for G\/e to be the equations f1, . . . , fr\u22122 with the\nsubstitution xn\u22122 = 0, yn\u22122 = 0.\nFirst consider the non-base distances on G\/e, namely {d} = {d1, . . . , dr\u22122},\nto be a generic set of real numbers. Since the contracted graph is maximally\nindependent, the solutions (for x1, . . . , xn\u22123, y1, . . . , yn\u22123) form a zero-dimensional\nvariety, V (0, 0) say. (The choice of notation will become clear shortly.) Clearly this\nis essentially the variety of the constraint equations {f1, . . . , fr} for the distance set\n{d1, . . . , dr\u22123, dr\u22122, 1, 0}\nfor G resulting from the double specialisation dr\u22121 = 1, dr = 0. Thus, in order\nto establish the reduction step it will be sufficient to show that if G is generically\nradical, then the variety arising from the semi-generic double specialisation is also\na radical variety. This requires some care, in view of the failure of a double special-\nisation variant of the Theorem 5.3. We shall break the double specialisation into\ntwo steps. Also, instead of specialising the generic edge lengths dr, dr\u22121 we choose\nto start afresh and specialise the given coordinates xn\u22122, yn\u22122. This results in a\nsimpler comparison of varieties.\nIn fact we can prove the reduction step for general non-planar graphs.\nTheorem 6.1. Let G be a maximally independent graph which has an edge con-\ntraction to a maximally independent graph G\/e. If G is radically soluble, then the\ngraph G\/e is also radically soluble.\nProof. Consider the set of distances {d} = {d1, . . . , dr\u22122} and the constraint equa-\ntions {f1, . . . , fr\u22122} in the variables x1, . . . xn\u22123, y1, . . . , yn\u22123, which arise when the\npair (xn\u22122, yn\u22122) takes three possible pairs of values, namely (X,Y ), (X, 0) and\n(0, 0), where X,Y are generic values in the coefficient field. Denote the three cor-\nresponding \u201cbig\u201d varieties, where {d} is a set of variables, by Vb(X,Y )), Vb(X, 0)\nand Vb(0, 0). For generic values of {d} let the corresponding \u201csmall\u201d varieties be\nV (X,Y )), V (X, 0) and V (0, 0). Also we write Ib(X,Y ), I(X,Y ), etc., for the six\ncorresponding ideals.\nWe have the following:\n1. The varieties Vb(X,Y ), Vb(X, 0) and Vb(0, 0) are irreducible. This follows\nfrom the fact that the equations are parametric in the variables. See Theorem 2.8.\n2. The variety V (0, 0) is zero dimensional by Theorem 2.4 because it is the\nvariety of the maximally independent generic graph G\/e. The varieties V (X, 0)\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2295\nand V (X,Y ) also have the form required for Theorem 2.3. The determinant of\nthe Jacobian matrix for V (0, 0) is obtained from the corresponding determinants\nfor V (X, 0) and V (X,Y ) by substituting X = 0 and Y = 0, and thus neither of\nthe determinants of the Jacobian matrices for V (X, 0) and V (X,Y ) are identically\nzero. Then V (X, 0) and V (X,Y ) are zero dimensional by Theorem 2.3.\nWe may now apply the specialisation theorem of Section 5 two times, once for\nthe specialisation (X, 0)\u2192 (0, 0) and once for the specialisation (X,Y )\u2192 (X, 0).\nSuppose then, that V (0, 0) is non-radical. In fact assume that there is a point of\nthis variety with coordinate xi not in a radical extension of Q({d}). Since Vb(0, 0) is\nirreducible and V (0, 0) is zero dimensional, it follows from Theorem 5.2 that there\nexists a univariate polynomial g(xi) in Q[{d}][xi] which generates the elimination\nideal I(0, 0)xi . By the closure theorem, Theorem 5.1, \u03c0xi(V (0, 0)) is precisely the\nvariety of the elimination ideal for xi, and this is precisely the set of zeros of gi.\nBy the non-radical hypothesis there exists an xi such that gi has some of its roots\nnon-radical (over Q({d})). By irreducibility, all the roots are non-radical.\nLikewise, V (X, 0) is zero dimensional and there exists a polynomial g(xi, X),\nwith positive degree in xi, which generates I(X, 0)xi . Moreover, since Vb(X, 0) is\nirreducible we may choose g so that g(xi, X) is not divisible by X and hence g(xi, 0)\nis not identically zero. But g(xi, 0) is in I(0, 0)xi, and by Theorem 5.3 g(xi) divides\ng(xi, 0). Thus g(xi, 0) has a non-radical root, g(xi, 0) is non-radical and V (X, 0) is\nnon-radical.\nRepeating this argument for V (X, 0) and V (X,Y ) shows that V (X,Y ) is non-\nradical over Q({d}). Thus V is non-radical over Q({d}, X, Y ). However, by triangle\ngeometry X and Y are radical functions of dr\u22121 and dr. Thus V is non-radical over\nQ(d1, ..., dr). \u0001\nRemark. One needs to take care with simultaneous specialisation. If we do both\nspecialisations together on V (X,Y ) we might have\ng(xi, X, Y ) = Xp(xi, X, Y ) + Y q(xi, X, Y ),\nwhere, for example, Y does not divide p and so g(xi, 0, 0) = 0, which gives no\ninformation on divisibility. In fact we have not excluded this possibility by doing\nthe specialisations one at a time. However we have shown that if this does occur,\nthen p and q both have factors which are non-radical. This is sufficient to deduce\nthat g(xi, X, Y ) is non-radical, even if it is zero on the double specialisation.\n7. Galois group under specialisation\nWe now obtain a theorem concerning the Galois groups of polynomials whose\ncoefficients contain indeterminates which may be specialised. This theorem plays\na role in the proof of the fact that if the graph G is soluble by radicals for generic\ndimensions, then it is also soluble by radicals for certain specialised dimensions.\nIn the proof we make use of the identification of the Galois group of p as the set\nof permutations in an index set associated with a certain irreducible factor of a\nmulti-variable polynomial constructed from p. This identification is well known\nand given in Stewart [14].\nLet d = {d1, . . . , dn} be algebraically independent variables with the rational\nfield extension Q(d) and let d\u2032 = {d\u20321, . . . , d\u2032n} be an n-tuple of rationals, viewed as\na specialisation of d.\n2296 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nTheorem 7.1. Let p \u2208 Q[d][t] be an irreducible monic polynomial with Galois\ngroup Gal(p) when viewed as a polynomial in Q(d)[t]. Let d\u2032 \u2208 Qn be a specialisation\nof d and let p\u2032 be the associated specialisation of p with Galois group Gal(p\u2032) over\nQ. Then Gal(p\u2032) is a subgroup of Gal(p). In particular if p is a radical polynomial,\nthen so too is p\u2032.\nWe are not aware of a published proof of this general specialisation theorem, but\nwe have discovered that the elementary case when the specialised polynomial has\ndistinct roots can be found in Van Der Waerden [18] (Section 61). The proof there\nis similar to the first part of our proof below.\nProof. Consider the irreducible polynomial\np(t) = tm + bm\u22121(d)tm\u22121 + . . .+ b0(d)\nwith coefficients bi(d) in Q[d]. Let \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1m be the roots of p(t) in some splitting\nfield, let {x1, . . . , xm} be indeterminates and let\n\u03b2 = \u03b11x1 + . . .+ \u03b1mxm.\nLet Sm be the symmetric group and define the Q-polynomial of p to be\nQ(t, x1, . . . , xm) =\n\u220f\n\u03c3\u2208Sm\n(t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2)) ,\nwhere \u03c3(\u03b2) = \u03b11x\u03c3(1) + . . . + \u03b1mx\u03c3(m). On expanding the product it can be seen\nthat the coefficient of a monomial tkx1i1x2i2 . . . xmim is a symmetric polynomial in\nthe roots \u03b1i. It follows that these coefficients are polynomials in bm\u22121(d), . . . , b0(d).\n(See [14].) Thus the polynomial Q belongs to Q[d][t, x].\nLet Q = Q1Q2 . . . Qr, where each Qi is irreducible in Q[d][t, x] and where Q1\ncontains the factor (t\u2212\u03b2). Since the roots of an irreducible polynomial are distinct\nso too are the expressions \u03c3(\u03b2), and it follows that the polynomial Q1 is well defined.\nWe have\nQ1 =\n\u220f\n\u03c3\u2208S\n(t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2))\nfor some index set S. This index set is a subgroup of Sm which is identifiable\nwith the Galois group of p. It coincides with the group of permutations \u03c3 of the\nvariables x1, . . . , xm for which \u03c3(Q1) = Q1. In fact each Qi has the form \u03c4 (Q1)\nfor some permutation \u03c4 , and from this it follows that if \u03c3(Qi) = Qi for some i,\nthen this holds true for all i and \u03c3 is in the Galois group. (For any permutation\n\u03c3 and polynomial P in Q[d][t, x] the polynomial \u03c3(P ) is defined by permuting the\nindeterminates x1, . . . , xm.) Note that in fact the Galois group identification holds\nwhenever p has distinct roots.\nNow consider the specialisation Q\u2032 of the polynomial Q in Q[d][t, x] upon re-\nplacing d by d\u2032. Since the coefficients of Q are polynomials in bm\u22121(d), . . . , b0(d),\nit is easy to see that Q\u2032 coincides with the Q-polynomial for p\u2032. Thus\nQ\u2032 =\n\u220f\n\u03c3\u2208Sm\n(t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2\u2032)) ,\nwhere \u03b2\u2032 = \u03b1\u20321x1+ . . .+\u03b1\n\u2032\nmxm and \u03b1\n\u2032\n1, . . . , \u03b1\n\u2032\nm are the roots of the specialisation p\n\u2032\nin some order. (Despite the notation we do not imply that there is a link between\n\u03b1\u2032i and \u03b1i.)\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2297\nNow consider both the specialisation of the factorisation, namely\nQ\u2032 = Q\u20321Q\n\u2032\n2 . . . Q\n\u2032\nr,\nand the irreducible factorisation of Q\u2032 in Q[t, x], say\nQ\u2032 = P1P2 . . . Ps.\nLet us first assume that the roots \u03b1\u2032i are distinct. Then, since each Pi is neces-\nsarily a product of some of the linear factors t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2\u2032), there is a unique factor, P1\nsay, divisible by t\u2212 \u03b2\u2032. Once again the Galois group Gal(p\u2032) is identifiable with a\nsubgroup T of Sm, where T is the index set such that\nP1 =\n\u220f\n\u03c3\u2208T\n(t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2\u2032)).\nMoreover, if \u03c3 \u2208 Gal(p\u2032), then \u03c3(Pi) = Pi for each i, and in particular \u03c3(Q\u20321) = Q\u20321\nsince Q\u2032i is a product of such factors. But if \u03c3(Q\n\u2032\ni) = Q\n\u2032\ni, then \u03c3(Qi) = Qi, by\nthe distinctness of the roots, and so \u03c3 \u2208 Gal(p). The resulting inclusion T \u2286 S\nidentifies Gal(p\u2032) as a subgroup of Gal(p).\nWe need a considerable refinement of this argument in the general case for which\nwe have p\u2032 = hn11 h\nn2\n2 . . . h\nnq\nq , where the hi are distinct irreducible polynomials. Once\nmore we can form the Q-polynomial for p\u2032,\nQ\u2032 =\n\u220f\n\u03c3\u2208Sm\n(t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2\u2032)) ,\nwhich has an irreducible factor, Q\u2032\u2217 say, with\nQ\u2032\u2217 =\n\u220f\n\u03c3\u2208R\n(t\u2212 \u03c3(\u03b2\u2032)) .\nBecause of root repetition the index set R is not uniquely associated with the\nfactor Q\u2032\u2217, and so we now give a more specific definition of Q\n\u2032\n\u2217. Let Q\u02c61(X1, . . . , Xs)\nbe the leading irreducible factor of the Q-polynomial (Q\u02c6 say) for the polynomial\nh1h2 . . . hq (with variables Xi to avoid ambiguity). Since the roots of this product\nare distinct, it follows from the first part of the proof that the index set for Q\u02c61\ngives an identification of Gal(h1h2 . . . hq) as a subgroup of Sk for some k. We now\ndefine Q\u2032\u2217 by\nQ\u2032\u2217(x1, . . . , xm) = Q\u02c61(X1, . . . , Xs),\nwhere each Xi is the sum over ni of the indeterminates xj corresponding to each of\nthe repeated roots of p\u2032. Since Q\u02c61 is irreducible over Q[d][t,X] it follows that Q\u2032\u2217 is\nirreducible over Q[d][t, x]. Also Q\u2032\u2217 does divide Q\n\u2032 since it is a product of some of\nthe linear factors of Q\u2032. In this way we have arranged that the index set R for Q\u2032\u2217\nis a subgroup of Sm. Also R is isomorphic to Gal(h1h2 . . . hq) = Gal(p\u2032).\nThe irreducible factor Q\u2032\u2217 divides some factor Q\u2032i of Q\n\u2032. At this point we have\nidentified Gal(p\u2032) with R, a subgroup of Sm, but we are still at liberty to relabel\nthe roots \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1m in order to re-identify Gal(p) with a new subgroup of Sm.\nWe choose to rearrange these roots so that the factors Qi, and hence the Q\u2032i, are\npermuted so that Q\u2032\u2217 divides Q\u20321. With these identifications it follows that the index\nset R is identified as a subgroup of S and hence that\nGal(p\u2032) = R \u2286 S = Gal(p),\nas desired.\n2298 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nThe last assertion of the theorem follows from the fact that a subgroup of a\nsoluble group is soluble. (See [14].) \u0001\nThe non-monic case of the last theorem can be deduced with the following change\nof variables argument.\nSuppose that p is an irreducible polynomial in Q[d][t] with non-zero specialisation\np\u2032. Choose a rational number a so that p\u2032(a) \u000b= 0, and hence p(a) \u000b= 0. Define the\nirreducible polynomial\nq(z) = tnp(t\u22121 + a)\n1\np(a)\n.\nThen q is monic with well-defined specialisation\nq\u2032(t) = tnp\u2032(t\u22121 + a)\n1\np\u2032(a)\n.\nThe splitting fields of p and q are isomorphic, as are those of p\u2032 and q\u2032, and so it\nfollows from the theorem above that Gal(p\u2032) is a subgroup of Gal(p).\nIt is clear that the arguments above extend verbatim to the specialisation of\nalgebraic independents over any field of characteristic zero, and we shall need results\nin this setting. Let E be such a field and let {d} be a set of algebraically independent\nvariables over E with rational field extension E(d).\nTheorem 7.2. Let p \u2208 E[d][t] be an irreducible polynomial with Galois group Gal(p)\nwhen viewed as a polynomial in E(d)[t]. Let d\u2032 \u2208 En be a specialisation of d and\nlet p\u2032 be the associated specialisation of p with Galois group Gal(p\u2032) over E. If p\u2032 is\nnon-constant, then Gal(p\u2032) is a subgroup of Gal(p). In particular if p is a radical\npolynomial, then so too is p\u2032.\n8. Planar 3-connected Laman graphs are non-soluble\nWe are now able to prove the main theorem stated in the Introduction.\nSuppose, by way of contradiction, that there exists a maximally independent\n3-connected planar graph which is soluble. Let G be such a graph with the fewest\nnumber of vertices. We show that G is the doublet graph and that the doublet\ngraph is not soluble by radicals. This contradiction completes the proof.\nBy the reduction step, Theorem 6.1, the vertex minimal graph G has no edge\ncontraction to a 3-connected maximally independent planar graph. It thus follows\nfrom the main reduction theorem for such graphs, Theorem 4.1, that either |G| = 6,\nand G is the doublet (since G is planar), or that G has a proper vertex induced\nmaximally independent subgraph with three vertices of attachment. However min-\nimality rules out the latter possibility because the next proposition shows that such\na proper subgraph admits substitution by a smaller graph, namely a triangle, and\nthe resulting graph is soluble if G is soluble.\nProposition 8.1. Let G be a 3-connected, maximally independent graph and let H\nbe a maximally independent subgraph of G with 3 vertices of attachment v1, v2 and\nv3. Let G\u2032 be the graph which is obtained from G by deleting all the internal vertices\nof H and all the edges of H and adding the edges (v1v2), (v2v3), (v3v1). Then G\u2032\nhas the properties:\n(i) G\u2032 is 3-connected.\n(ii) G\u2032 is maximally independent.\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2299\n(iii) If the distances of the constraint equations defined by G are algebraically\nindependent, then any solution of the constraint equations, when restricted to the\nvertices of G\u2032, is a solution of the constraint equations for G\u2032 for suitably chosen\nalgebraically independent distances of G\u2032.\nProof. We prove that G\u2032 is 3-connected by showing that every pair of vertices in G\u2032\nare joined by three independent paths. For any pair of vertices in G\u2032 we generate\nthree independent paths as follows. Select the corresponding pair of vertices in G.\nSince G is 3-connected, they are joined by three independent paths. Then each of\nthe paths in G corresponds to a path in G\u2032 which consists of the corresponding path\nsegments in G\\H plus possibly a single edge (vivj) or a pair of edges (vivk)(vkvj)\nwhich replace any path segment in the interior of H which enters at vertex vi,\npossibly includes vertex vk, and leaves H at vj . Each of these paths in G\u2032 consists\nof a subset of the vertices of the corresponding path in G, and it follows that paths\nwhich are independent in G are also independent in G\u2032.\nIf H1 and H2 are any two edge disjoint subgraphs in G, then it follows easily\nfrom the definition of free(H) that\nfree(H1 \u222aH2) = free(H1) + free(H2) + 3\u2212 2|H1 \u2229H2|.\nThis gives immediately that free(G\u2032) = 0. If G\u2032 is not independent, then there is\na subgraph R of G\u2032 with free(R) < 0 and there is an edge (v1v2), say, which is in\nR but not in G. If v3 is not in R, then (R\\(v1v2)) \u222aH is in G and\nfree((R\\(v1v2)) \u222aH) < 0\nwhich contradicts the independence of G. If v3 is in R, then\n(R{(v1v2), (v2v3), (v1v3)}) \u222aH\nis in G and free((R{(v1v2), (v2v3), (v1v3)}) \u222aH) < 0 which contradicts the inde-\npendence of G.\nTheorem 2.3 implies that for algebracially independent distances {di}, any zero\nof the variety of G has coordinates {xj} which are algebraically independent. This\nzero of the variety of G gives a zero of the variety of G\u2032 (with the same {xj} where\nthey occur and with the same {di} where they occur and d12, d23 and d13 computed\nfrom dij = (xi \u2212 xj)2 + (yi \u2212 yj)2), and this zero therefore has coordinates which\nare algebraically independent. It follows from Theorem 2.3 that the distances of G\u2032\nare algebraically independent. \u0001\nWe now show that the doublet is a non-soluble CAD graph.\nLet v1 = (0, 0), v2 = (1, 0) be the vertices of the base edge. Introduce the\ncoordinates (xi, yi) for the remaining vertices vi, 3 \u2264 i \u2264 6, and the distances\ndj , 2 \u2264 j \u2264 9, for the non-base edges. The indexing scheme is illustrated in Figure\n11.\n2300 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\n4\n5\n21\n6\n3\n2\n4\n5\n3\n1\n9\n8 7\n6\nFigure 11. Coordinatisation of the doublet.\nThe resulting polynomials {f} for the normalised constraint equations take the\nform\nx24 + y24 \u2212 d29\nx25 + y\n2\n5 \u2212 d28\n(x3 \u2212 1)2 + y23 \u2212 d22\n(x6 \u2212 1)2 + y26 \u2212 d27\n(x3 \u2212 x4)2 + (y3 \u2212 y4)2 \u2212 d23\n(x4 \u2212 x5)2 + (y4 \u2212 y5)2 \u2212 d24\n(x5 \u2212 x6)2 + (y5 \u2212 y6)2 \u2212 d25\n(x6 \u2212 x3)2 + (y6 \u2212 y3)2 \u2212 d26.\nFor each choice of real algebraically independent squared distances d22, . . . , d\n2\n9,\nthese equations determine a zero-dimensional complex affine variety V ({f}) in C8.\nIn order to prove that the zeros of the equation set are non-radical for generic\n{d2}, it would be sufficient to obtain a generator (or any element) of the elimination\nideal for some variable (x3 say) over the field Q({d2}) where the {d2} are generic\nparameters and to show that all of its zeros are non-radical. However Maple is\nunable to complete such a calculation, and it is necessary to use some integer\nvalues for the {d} and to appeal to the specialisation Theorem 7.1. Note that the\nuse of this theorem requires us to know that the specialised polynomial does indeed\narise by specialising a corresponding polynomial in the generic elimination ideal. It\nis for this reason that we use resultants to perform the elimination explicitly.\nNote that the fifth equation, and its three successors, admit the squared form\n(d23 \u2212 (x3 \u2212 x4)2 + y23 + y24)2 \u2212 4y23 y24 = 0,\nwhich in turn yields an equation in x3 and x4 alone on substituting for y23 and y\n2\n4\nfrom the first four equations. In this way we obtain a system {g} = {g1, g2, g3, g4}\nof four quartic equations in x3, x4, x5, x6 and the squared distances. It follows that\nTHE NON-SOLVABILITY OF GENERIC 3-CONNECTED GRAPHS 2301\nthe projection \u03c0 (V ({f}) for the variables x3, x4, x5, x6 is a subset of the variety\nV ({g}) in C4.\nTo see that the doublet graph is (generically) non-soluble we show that first there\nis a specialised integral doublet which has non-radical solutions. This is achieved by\na Maple calculation of successive resultants of the associated specialised constraint\nequations {g\u2032}:\nh\u20321 = Res(g\u20321, g\u20322, x4),\nh\u20322 = Res(g\n\u2032\n3, g\n\u2032\n2, x6),\nh\u20323 = Res(h\u20321, h\u20322, x5).\nThis results in an integral univariate polynomial h\u20323(x3) which lies in the ideals\nI({f \u2032}) and I({g\u2032}). The polynomial h\u20323 is of degree 28 which factors as the product\nof a degree 12 and a degree 16 polynomial (the degree 16 polynomial does not\ncontribute to zeros of the variety, but this does not affect the argument). Maple\nis unable to compute the Galois group of either of these polynomials. However\nfor our well-chosen distance values (determined by judicious trial and error) the\npolynomial factors as a product of four irreducible polynomials of degrees 6, 6, 8,\n8. The Galois groups of these polynomial factors are computed in the Appendix,\nand each is a full symmetric group. It follows that h\u20323 and V ({f \u2032}) are not radical\nover Q.\nTheorem 8.2. There exists an integral lengthed doublet graph which is not soluble\nby radicals.\nProof. With the labelling order above consider the unsquared distances 1, 5, 15,\n10, 16, 8, 5, 13, 13. (The two triangles in this integral doublet are isosceles, with\nsides 10, 13, 13 and 8, 5, 5.) By the Appendix h\u20323 is a non-radical polynomial. \u0001\nWe now use the Galois group specialisation theorem to show that the doublet\ngraph is generically non-soluble. Since the generic polynomial h3 is not computable\nby Maple, we examine the resultant calculation more closely to see that h\u20323 is the\nspecialisation of the corresponding resultant polynomial h3 for the generic equation\nset.\nLemma 8.3. Let f1, f2 be polynomials in {x}, {d} viewed as polynomials in {x}\nwith coefficients in E({d}). Let {d\u2032} be a specialisation resulting in specialisations\nf \u20321, f\n\u2032\n2 such that deg(fi, x1) = deg(f \u2032i , x1) for i = 1, 2. Then the specialisation of\nRes(f1, f2, x) is equal to Res(f \u20321, f\n\u2032\n2, x).\nProof. Immediate on examination of the definition of the resultant as a Sylvester\ndeterminant. \u0001\nFor our polynomial equations {g} Maple is able to compute the generic polyno-\nmials h1 and h2 and verify that if h1 = Res(g1, g2, x4), h2 = Res(g3, g4, x6), then\ndeg(h1, x4) = deg(h\u20321, x4) = deg(h2, x6) = deg(h\n\u2032\n2, x6) = 4.\nAlthough the polynomial h3 is not readily computable, the lemma shows that\nh\u20323 is the specialisation of h3.\nTheorem 8.4. The doublet graph is non-soluble.\n2302 J. C. OWEN AND S. C. POWER\nProof. By Theorem 8.2 and its proof h\u20323 is a non-radical polynomial, and in fact\nall the zeros of its irreducible factors are non-radical over Q. By the Galois group\nspecialisation theorem it follows that h3 must be non-radical over Q({d}), and the\ntheorem follows. \u0001\nAppendix\nThe polynomial h\u20323 and its factors are computed by the following Maple code:\nd2:= 13; d3:= 15; d4:= 8; d5:= 16;\nd6:= 10; d7:= 13; d8:= 5; d9:= 5;\nyy4:=d9^2-x4^2; yy5:=d8^2-x5^2;\nyy3:=d2^2-(x3-1)^2; yy6:=d7^2-(x6-1)^2;\nA:= (d3^2- (x3^2+x4^2 - 2*x3*x4 + yy3 + yy4))^2 -4*yy3*yy4;\nB:= (d4^2- (x4^2+x5^2 - 2*x4*x5 + yy4 + yy5) )^2-4*yy4*yy5;\nC:= (d5^2- (x5^2+x6^2 - 2*x5*x6 + yy5 + yy6) )^2-4*yy5*yy6;\nE:= (d6^2- (x6^2+x3^2 - 2*x6*x3 + yy6 + yy3) )^2-4*yy6*yy3;\neqns:={A=0,B=0,C=0,E=0}; expand(eqns);\nX:=resultant(A,B,x4): Y:=resultant(C,E,x6):\nZ:=resultant(X,Y,x5):\nfactor(Z):\nThe irreducible factors are the following four integral polynomials, and (according\nto Maple) each is non-soluble over Q.\n731161600000x83 \u2212 2884724544000x73 \u2212 254604702168560x63+\n929745074065696x53 + 29180343859430360x\n4\n3 \u2212 104245652941659832x33\u2212\n1119855862049129679x23 + 4022769219537416744x3 + 1620713038685642896,\n731161600000x83 \u2212 5275493184000x73 \u2212 202247115019760x63+\n1002422141698336x53 + 16575444136627160x\n4\n3 \u2212 46366435207277752x33\u2212\n299095702632348879x23 + 813935120915198504x3 + 13663404945744016,\n753831936x63 \u2212 84641660928x53 \u2212 4996031627504x43+\n486105086115256x33 + 36795384322988721x\n2\n3 + 920226256962743080x3+\n10127898920872530064,\n2747437056x63 + 143122194432x\n5\n3 \u2212 17613405584624x43 \u2212 615688594921544x33+\n69050497529701041x23 \u2212 776224290995754200x3 + 1152246393155768464.\nReferences\n[1] L.
