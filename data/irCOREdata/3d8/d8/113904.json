We compare the effect of a \ncoagulation bath containing either a polymer binder e.g. polyethylene imine or \nsimply a precipitating solvent system e.g. acetone; the electrical, mechanical and \nmorphological properties of the resulting fibres were studied. Novel biocompatible \nelectrode structures were generated suitable for a variety of biomedical \napplications, e.g. in biosensors or in systems where the application of an electrical \nfield is advantageous (such as stimulation of electrically excitable cells such as \nnerve and muscle cells). \n \nKeywords: carbon nanotube, biomolecule, conducting fibre, fibre spinning, coagulation. \n \n \n \n 2 \nIntroduction \nThe unique electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have \nattracted interest in their biological application both at the molecular and cellular \nlevel.[1,2] The electrical properties of CNTs may permit them to be utilised to stimulate \nelectrically excitable cells (nerve and muscle cells). Studies on interfacing CNTs with \nbiomolecules have been of interest to function as platforms to support the growth of \nnerve cells.[3] It has been shown that varying the mechanical[4], electrical[5] and \nchemical[6] characteristics of surfaces influences neurite outgrowth rates and can even \nallow control of neuron shape.  \n  The possibility of employing CNTs as substrates able to improve neural signal \ntransfer has been demonstrated by Lovat et al.[7] In another study, while neurons were \nfound to extend neurites when grown on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs)[3] \nmore elaborate neurite branching was observed when neurons were grown on MWNTs \nfunctionalised with polyethylene imine.[2] PEI is a widely used permissive substrate for \nnerve cells; supporting attachment and growth of neurons. Other molecules of interest are \nchitosan (CHIT) and hyaluronic acid (HA). CHIT and HA have independently shown to \nbe effective in supporting the growth of a range of mammalian cell lines including \nosteoblasts[8,9] and nerve cells.[10, 11] CHIT has also been blended with HA to form \ncomposite biomaterials for cartilaginous tissue scaffolds.[12] Recent, innovative \napproaches to tissue repair involving these biomolecules have been developed.[13] \n These studies imply that suitably functionalised CNTs could potentially be used \nin scaffolds to guide neurite outgrowth and highlights the opportunity available in \ncombining CNTs with appropriate biomolecules. CNTs must be built into macroscopic \n 3 \nstructures in order to exploit their remarkable properties. Stable CNT dispersions exhibit \nliquid crystalline behaviour similar to conventional rod-like polymers in solution[14] (such \nas poly-paraphenylene terephthalamide) and so lend themselves to solution spinning \nprocessing. The steps involved in wet spinning of CNTs present an ideal opportunity to \nintroduce CNTs and biomolecules into practically useful structures. Vigolo et al.[15] \ndispersed CNTs in a surfactant containing solution and then assembled the CNTs into \nlong ribbons and fibres in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing coagulation bath. Barisci \net al.[16] developed this fibre spinning process further by using DNA as the CNT \ndispersant and thereby adding bio-functionality to the fibre. The fibres produced however \nhad electrical conductivity values several orders of magnitude lower than individual \nCNTs. Removing the polymer (PVA) binder in these fibres improved the electrical \nproperties at great cost to the mechanical properties. Munoz et al.[17] reported the use of \nsurfactants as dispersants while employing a polyethylene-imine coagulation bath to \nproduce more highly conducting carbon nanotube fibres. Here we report the novel \ncombination of using biocompatible molecules as dispersants and spinning into \ncoagulation baths including polyethylene-imine or acetone. This results in mechanically \nrobust yet electrically conducting biomolecule containing fibres. \n 4 \nResults \nThe most common means of obtaining relatively concentrated CNT dispersions consists \nof using low molecular weight surfactants as dispersants in water. Biomolecules such as \nCHIT and HA are excellent dispersants for CNTs, usually at lower concentrations than \nsurfactants.[14] We prepared SWNT-biomolecule dispersions by sonicating a given \namount of SWNTs in an aqueous solution of biomolecule (CHIT or HA), to form highly \nstable biomolecule-SWNT suspensions. In the case of CHIT as dispersant, a homogenous \ndispersion was obtained with a concentration of 0.3 % by weight of SWNTs and \nemploying a 2:1 ratio by weight of CHIT:SWNT. Dispersions differing from this \nconcentration and ratio contained large clusters, between 50 and 100\u00b5m in size, of non-\ndispersed SWNTs. This is in contrast to dispersions made with HA.[14] In the case of HA \nas dispersant, concentrations of up to 0.6 % by weight of SWNTs were possible. To \nobtain a homogenous dispersion, at least a 2:3 ratio by weight of biomolecule:SWNT was \nnecessary.  \nThe affinity for SWNTs and permissiveness as a substrate for neuronal growth led \nus to consider employing PEI as the coagulant in the fibre spinning process. A \ncoagulation drop test indicated that acetone is also a suitable coagulant for the \ndispersions. Since acetone has a low boiling point and high vapour pressure, it is easily \nremoved from the fibre resulting in a biocompatible structure. Processing these \nbiomolecule-SWNT dispersions by injection into a flowing stream of polymer \nsolution\/solvent produces gel fibres containing SWNTs. As a result of diffusion of the \nPEI into the fibre during the coagulation process cylindrical fibres were formed. Ribbon-\nlike fibres formed in the case of acetone as coagulant.  \n 5 \nTo achieve optimal spinning conditions, the influence of experimental variables: \nconcentration of coagulant (between 5 and 40% w\/v for PEI), time spent in coagulation \nbath (between 5 and 60 minutes) and the rate of injection into the coagulation bath \n(injection rate 100-250 ml\/hr, coagulation bath rotation rate 20-40 rpm) were \ninvestigated. Employing injection rates and spinning speeds found to be most favourable \n(rotation speed of 25 rpm; injection rate of 250 ml\/hr for PEI and 100 ml\/hr for acetone), \nthe SWNT-biomolecule dispersions were spun into a coagulation bath to form CNT-bio-\nfibres. The coagulation bath consisted of either polyethylene imine in methanol (5 wt. %) \nor acetone. Fibre lengths of up to several metres could be made using optimal conditions; \nhowever to avoid entanglement in the rotating coagulation bath typical fibre lengths were \n10cm. \nWe obtained uniform cylindrical HA-SWNT-PEI and CHIT-SWNT-PEI fibres \nwith typical diameters of 80 \u00b5m. In contrast HA-SWNT and CHIT-SWNT fibres \ncoagulated by acetone were ribbon-like and had typical widths of 70 \u00b5m and thicknesses \nof 50 \u00b5m. Biomolecules have been shown to affect the assembly of CNTs e.g. HA and \ndenatured DNA are effective at stabilising CNTs leading to suspensions that are \nisotropic.[14, 18] Injecting the SWNT-dispersion in the flowing stream of polymer solution \nmimics the conditions in solutions of rigid polymers or anisotropic colloids.[19] As a \nresult, both biomolecule assisted and flow induced alignment of the nanotubes is \nexpected in the direction of the fluid velocity, which is parallel to the fibre axis. Scanning \nelectron microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the CHIT-SWNT-PEI fibres have a \ncorrugated surface with the axis of corrugation approximately aligned parallel to the fibre \naxis. These corrugations (typically 0.3-1 \u00b5m) are also observed on the HA-SWNT-PEI, \n 6 \nHA-SWNT and CHIT-SWNT fibres, with SEM images suggesting a rougher surface \nstructure than for the CHIT-SWNT-PEI fibre. Images of fractured ends of the fibres \nindicate the presence of SWNT bundles coated with biomolecule dispersant and\/or PEI \nand that a large majority of the SWNTs are aligned along the fibre axis. \nRaman spectroscopy (Figure 2) has confirmed the presence of CNTs in the fibres. \nHigh resolution Raman spectroscopy measurements of the radial breathing modes (RBM) \nof SWNTs was carried out on the raw SWNT powder used to make the dispersions, \nSWNT-biomolecule dispersions and the fibres produced. The spectra (representative \nspectra are shown in Figure 2) indicate that a significant interaction takes place between \nthe nanotubes and each biomolecule used as a dispersant. An upshift in the RBM peaks of \nbetween 3 and 5 cm-1 has been observed for the SWNT-biomolecule dispersions and \nbetween 5 and 7 cm-1 for the SWNT-biofibres. Positions of the D and G bands for raw \nnanotubes, dispersions, and fibres are within 4 cm\u20131 variation, which is not significant \nenough to imply doping of the nanotubes by the biomolecules.20 These observations are \nconsistent with de-bundling as previously reported. [21]   \nTable 1 compares mechanical properties, conductivity, and capacitance values for \nfibres coagulated under different conditions. Mechanical testing determined that the \naverage tensile strength of the HA-SWNT-PEI fibre was 120 MPa while for the CHIT-\nSWNT-PEI fibre it was measured as 40 MPa (Table 1). The positively charged amino \ngroups of CHIT may repel any cross-linking interaction with the amino groups of PEI in \nthe fibre resulting in a lower tensile strength. A more favourable cross-linking interaction \nof the PEI amino groups with the negative acidic residues of the glycosaminoglycan \nchains of HA is possible which is supported by higher tensile strength values. The \n 7 \naverage tensile strength of the HA-SWNT fibre was 51 MPa, while for the CHIT-SWNT \nfibre it was measured as 61 MPa. We attribute these lower tensile strength values in the \nacetone coagulated fibres to the absence of a supporting\/cross-linking polymer matrix in \nthe coagulation medium e.g. PEI. The average tensile strength of the HA-SWNT-PEI \nfibre is slightly higher than that of the DNA-SWNT-PVA fibres previously reported.16 A \nskin\u2013core fibre microstructure was not observed for the fibres reported here unlike CNT-\nPVA fibres with CNT-enriched inner core and PVA-enriched outer skin.15,16 \nHomogenous distribution of the biomolecule and CNTs was observed on the fibre cross \nsection (Figure 3). Although the mechanical properties of these fibres do not compare \nfavourably with commercial high-strength fibres used in structural composites, they \npossess mechanical properties sufficient for use as biosensor electrodes or for the \nfabrication of substrates for nerve and muscle repair. \nThe electrical conductivity of previously formed DNA-SWNT-PVA fibres was \nreported as 0.04 S cm-1. Annealed fibres have been reported with conductivities as high \nas 167 S cm-1, [16] however the increase in electrical properties is accompanied with \nsevere losses in mechanical properties. Conductivities of 0.2 and 8.4 S cm-1 were \nmeasured for the CHIT-SWNT-PEI and HA-SWNT-PEI fibres produced here \nrespectively (Table 1), which is five times higher and over two orders of magnitude \nhigher respectively than for the DNA-SWNT-PVA fibres previously reported. It was \nfound that the length of time spent in the coagulation bath did not significantly affect the \nconductivity of the fibres; however in the case of PEI a longer rinsing time proved \nbeneficial (e.g. soaking for 3 minutes resulted in a fibre conductivity of 0.04 S cm-1, \ncompared to conductivities of >1.0 S cm-1 for 30 min rinses). This is presumably due to a \n 8 \nlower insulating PEI content within the fibre resulting in more electrical connections \nbetween CNTs. It was difficult to accurately measure the CNT content of the fibres. \nOverlap in the decomposition temperature of each component (CNTs and biomolecules) \nof the composite fibre was observed during thermogravimetric analysis (results not \nshown).  \nConductivities of 23 and 186 S cm-1 were measured for CHIT-SWNT and HA-\nSWNT fibres respectively; the fibres produced from acetone. This is nearly four orders of \nmagnitude higher in the case of the HA-SWNT fibre than for the DNA-SWNT-PVA \nfibres previously reported, while still retaining bio-functionality. We attribute the high \nconductivities in the acetone coagulated fibres to the absence of a supporting polymer \nmatrix in the coagulation medium e.g. PEI. It appears that the amount of biomolecule \nmaterial remaining in the fibre was sufficient to provide mechanical support but low \nenough to allow electrical conductivity via intimate contact between CNT junctions. In \nsupport of this, CHIT-SWNT fibres had conductivities up to 8 times lower than that of \nHA-SWNT fibres, presumably because of the higher biomolecule concentration required \nto achieve a homogeneous spinning dispersion (0.6 wt % CHIT for 0.3 wt % CNTs). \nAssuming no CNT and biomolecule loss during fibre formation, the CNT composition of \nthe acetone coagulated fibres could be estimated based on the concentration of the CNT \ndispersions. This translates to 60 wt % and 33 wt % CNT content for the HA-SWNT, and \nCHIT-SWNT fibres, respectively. \nCyclic voltammetry, (performed in the physiological medium 0.2M PBS, \npH=7.4), gave responses that indicate capacitive behaviour predominates, irrespective of \nthe coagulation system used. A linear dependence of the current flows on scan rate was \n 9 \nobserved and specific capacitance values of 34 F\/g, 9 F\/g and 2.4 F\/g for HA-SWNT, \nCHIT-SWNT and HA-SWNT-PEI fibres respectively were obtained. However, more \nresistive CV measurements were observed for CHIT-SWNT-PEI fibres because of their \nreduced electrical conductivity (giving a specific capacitance of 6 mF\/g).  \nA series of preliminary measurements using 1mM potassium ferricyanide were \ncarried out to characterise the electrochemical response of these novel CNT-fibre \nelectrodes.  Measurement of the ferricyanide faradaic current as a function of the scan \nrate was performed on two of the fibres with the highest electrical conductivity (HA-\nSWNT and CHIT-SWNT) to establish whether the electrochemical reaction was \ndiffusion-controlled. Figure 4b shows voltammograms of the fibres HA-SWNT and \nCHIT-SWNT and a glassy carbon electrode recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV\/s. Analysis \nof the faradaic current obtained resulted in linear plots of Ip vs. v1\/2 plot over range \nstudied (5-200mV\/s), indicating that the current is controlled by semi-infinite linear \ndiffusion in the case of this redox couple. Similarly, diffusion-controlled electron transfer \nat these CNT-biofibre microelectrodes was also found for ferrocene monocarboxylic acid \nand ruthenium hexamine chloride (data not shown). The potential differences (\u2206Ep) and \nthe ratios of the anodic peak current to the cathodic peak current (Ipa\/ Ipc of ferricyanide) \nare compared in Figure 4c. As expected, as the conductivity of the fibres increases, the \npeak potential difference as well as Ipa\/ Ipc decreases and the Ipa\/ Ipc is closer to 1 with \nan improvement in reversibility of the couple. Overall, the results presented here \ndemonstrate that acetone coagulated CNT-biofibre microelectrodes possess sufficient \nelectrical conductivity and a wide working potential range making them useful for many \nanalytical applications.  \n 10 \nWhile CHIT as dispersant and PEI as coagulant produced fibres with higher \nelectrical conductivity than the DNA-SWNT-PVA fibres, it did so at the cost of \nmechanical properties. On the other hand, HA as dispersant and PEI as coagulant \nprovided novel fibres with the same mechanical properties as the DNA-SWNT-PVA \nfibres but with a two-order of magnitude increase in electrical conductivity. Further \nincreases in conductivity were obtained when acetone was used as the coagulant, but \nunfortunately to the detriment of mechanical properties. \nIn summary we have successfully prepared novel carbon nanotube fibre \nmicroelectrodes from all biocompatible polymers. While incorporating bio-functionality, \nthe HA-SWNT-PEI fibres compromise little in terms of mechanical properties with a two \norder of magnitude increase in electronic conductivity compared to DNA-SWNT-PVA \nfibres. With adequate mechanical properties for the intended applications the HA-SWNT \nacetone coagulated fibres have electrical conductivities four orders of magnitude higher \nthan the DNA-SWNT-PVA fibres. These fibres may prove useful as biosensor \nmicroelectrodes and substrates which support and allow the electrical stimulation of \nmammalian cells \u2013 studies currently under way in our laboratories. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Australian Research \nCouncil. \n \n 11 \nTable 1: Mechanical and electrical properties of SWNT-fibres. * Data taken from \nreference [16]. \nDispersant HA CHIT DNA* \nCoagulant PEI Acetone PEI Acetone PVA \nCNT: dispersant ratio 2:3 2:3 1:2 1:2 1:1 \nTensile Strength  (MPa) \n120  \n\u00b1 32 \n51  \n\u00b1 10 \n40  \n\u00b1 18 \n60  \n\u00b1 15 \n109 \nYoung\u2019s modulus (GPa) \n8 \n\u00b1 1 \n5  \n\u00b1 1 \n4 \n\u00b1 1 \n8 \n\u00b1 1 \n14 \nStrain (%) \n13 \n\u00b1 1 \n4  \n\u00b1 1 \n3  \n\u00b1 1 \n9  \n\u00b1 1 \n- \nConductivity (S\/cm) \n8 \n\u00b1 1 \n186  \n\u00b1 23 \n0.2  \n\u00b1 0.1 \n23  \n\u00b1 5 \n0.04 \nCapacitance (F\/g) 4  34 0.006 9 - \n \n \nFigure 1: Structures of biomolecules used as SWNT dispersant; (a) Chitosan and (b) \nHyaluronic Acid . \n \nFigure 2: Raman Spectra of (a) raw SWNT, (b) HA-SWNT dispersion and (c) HA-\nSWNT-PEI fibre confirming presence of SWNTs. \n \n 12 \nFigure 3: High Resolution SEM images of SWNT-Fibres and of fractured fibre ends, \nshowing differences in fibre morphology, (a) HA-SWNT-PEI, (b) CHIT-SWNT-PEI, (c) \nHA-SWNT and (d) CHIT-SWNT fibres. \n \nFigure 4: Electrochemical behaviour of CNT fibres HA-SWNT (solid line), CHIT-\nSWNT (dashed line), HA-SWNT-PEI (dotted line) and CHIT-SWNT-PEI (solid grey \nline).
