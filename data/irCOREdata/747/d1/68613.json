Using the theoretical framework of the Self Regulation Model (SRM), many studies\nhave demonstrated that beliefs individuals hold about their physical health problems are important\nin predicting health outcomes. This study tested the SRM in the context of a mental health problem,\nschizophrenia.\nMethod. One hundred and twenty-four people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were assessed on\nmeasures of symptom severity, beliefs about their mental health problems, coping and appraisal\nof outcome at two time points, 6 months apart.\nResults. Using multivariate analyses and controlling for severity of symptoms, beliefs about\nmental health were found to be significant predictors of outcome. Beliefs about greater negative\nconsequences were the strongest and most consistent predictors of a poorer outcome in both cross-\nsectional and longitudinal analyses.\nConclusions. These results suggest that the SRM is a promising model for mental health prob-\nlems and may highlight important areas for development in clinical, and especially psychosocial\ninterventions.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn physical health research many social cog-\nnition models have been proposed to identify\nkey beliefs mediating the impact of disease\nfactors on emotional and behavioural respon-\nses (Connor & Norman, 1995). Overall, these\nmodels have shown that beliefs about illness\naccount for significant variance in outcome ap-\npraisal and are amenable to change. These find-\nings offer important opportunities for clinical\ninterventions.\nThe Self Regulation Model (SRM; Leventhal\net al. 1984) assumes that people are problem\nsolvers whose health-related behaviours are at-\ntempts to close the perceived gap between their\ncurrent health and their future goal state. The\nmodel proposes that coping strategies are guided\nby interpretation of illness experiences. Indi-\nviduals constantly appraise their outcome in\nrelation to their desired health state and modify\ntheir beliefs and behaviour accordingly.\nThe SRM hypothesizes that beliefs about\nidentity, cause, consequences, timeline and the\npotential for control\/cure are the key beliefs\nguiding responses. These beliefs can be assessed\nusing the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ;\nWeinman et al. 1996). The recent Illness Per-\nception Questionnaire Revised (IPQR; Moss-\nMorris et al. 2001), includes additional sub-\nscales : \u2018 timeline cyclical \u2019 (how variable the\nsymptoms are) and \u2018coherence \u2019 (how much in-\ndividuals believe they understand their illness).\nThe control dimension has been divided into\npersonal and treatment control, and a dimen-\nsion to assess the \u2018emotional \u2019 response of the\nindividual has been added. IPQR is explicitly\ndesigned to be modified to suit particular ill-\nnesses and for research use.\n* Address for correspondence: Dr F. Lobban, Department of\nClinical Psychology, The Whelan Building, The Quad, Brownlow\nHill, The University of Liverpool, Liverpool, L69 3GB, UK.\n(Email : fiona.lobban@liverpool.ac.uk)\nPsychological Medicine, 2004, 34, 1165\u20131176. f 2004 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S003329170400203X Printed in the United Kingdom\n1165\nOutcome appraisal is defined as perceptions\nof current health state and has been assessed in\nvarious ways, the most common focusing on the\nindividuals\u2019 perceived quality of life, emotional\nstate or current level of functioning. These foci\nrecognize the broad impact of physical health\nproblems. In studies into schizophrenia, the\nmain outcome is often symptom severity but\nthis may not always be the most desirable out-\ncome from the patients\u2019 perspective. A more\npsychological perspective, in which the ultimate\naim is to reduce distress, suggests that emotional\nstate, quality of life, satisfaction and function-\ning are important outcome variables ; therefore\nthese are used as measures of outcome appraisal\nin this study. Recent work by Birchwood et al.\n(1993, 2000) suggests that for some people with\nschizophrenia, an increase in emotional distress\noccurs after the remission of psychotic symp-\ntoms, and can be predicted by negative ap-\npraisals of this experience. Therefore, at least\nsome variance in distress is associated with\nappraisals of psychosis rather than directly due\nto the psychotic process. This study attempts\nto examine appraisals about psychosis more\nclosely.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nParticipants were identified via Community\nMentalHealthTeams.Diagnosiswas taken from\na systematic chart review using a checklist of\ndiagnostic criteria based on DSM-IV (APA,\n1994). Information about prescribedmedication,\nlength of contact with services and recent his-\ntory of symptom fluctuations was taken from\nhospital notes.\nMeasures\nAll assessments were conducted by the first\nauthor (F.L.) or a research assistant.\nSymptom severity\nThe Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale\n(PANSS; Kay et al. 1989) is widely used as a\nmeasure of symptom severity in schizophrenia\nand has acceptable levels of reliability and val-\nidity (Kay et al. 1989). A total of the positive\nand negative subscale scores was used in this\nstudy. The general subscale was not used as it\nhas been shown to be less reliable (Purnine et al.\n2000) and includes items that are confounded\nwith appraisal of outcome (e.g. anxiety and\ndepression). Each interviewer\u2019s reliability was\nassessed by comparing ratings of 10 interviews\nwith those of an experienced consultant psy-\nchiatrist. Intra-class correlations suggested good\ninter-rater reliability (0.83\u20130.95).\nCoping\nCoping was assessed using a structured inter-\nview in conjunction with the PANSS. For each\nitem identified as a problem by the rater (a score\nof 4+ on the PANSS), participants were asked\nabout their primary appraisal of the experience,\ni.e. whether or not they perceived this to be a\nproblem. If they did, they were asked to describe\nwhat coping strategies they used. Positive and\nnegative strategies were defined by the taxonomy\nreported by Tarrier (1987) and Tarrier et al.\n(1993). Classifications were made by the first\nauthor (F.L.) and a Professor of Psychology\n(C.H.) that were highly reliable with each other\n(kappa=0.88), and participants were categor-\nized into the following variables for use in the\nanalysis.\n(1) Positive coping. 1=participant did not\nperceive any problems; 2=problems were per-\nceived but a low frequency of positive strategies\nwere reported (mean of less than two per prob-\nlem); 3=problems were perceived and a high\nfrequency of positive strategies were reported\n(mean of two or more per problem).\n(2) Negative coping. 1=participant did not\nperceive any problems; 2=problems were per-\nceived but no negative strategies reported;\n3=problems were perceived and negative strat-\negies used.\nBeliefs about mental health problems\nThe Illness Perception Questionnaire for\nSchizophrenia (IPQS)\nA modified version of the IPQR was used to\nassess beliefs about mental health problems.\nAdaptations were based on extensive qualitative\ninterviews with people diagnosed with schizo-\nphrenia (Lobban & Barrowclough, unpublished\nobservations). Alphas for the subscales ranged\nfrom 0.68 to 0.87, and all showed good test\u2013\nretest reliability (range=0.57\u20130.95) (Lobban\net al. in press). The subscales are summarized\nbelow and the items are listed in the Appendix.\n1166 F. Lobban et al.\n(1) Identity (58 items). Fifty-eight mental\nhealth experiences associated with schizophrenia\nwere listed including positive symptoms, nega-\ntive symptoms, affective symptoms, and side\neffects of medication. For each item participants\nwere asked to indicate whether or not they had\nexperienced this, and whether they attributed it\nto amental health problem, effects ofmedication,\nand\/or other factors. The remaining subscales\nall consisted of statements that were scored be-\ntween 1 (=strongly disagree) and 5 (=strongly\nagree).\n(2) Timeline acute\/chronic (6 items).\n(3) Timeline cyclical (4).\n(4) Consequences (11).\n(5) Personal control (4).\n(6) Treatment control (5).\n(7) Coherence (5).\nHigh scores denote a more chronic and cycli-\ncal timeline, greater perceived negative conse-\nquences, greater perceived personal control and\nbelief in treatment, and a sense of having a less\ncoherent understanding. Although a causal sub-\nscale is included in the IPQS, the items were not\neasily classified into meaningful dimensions and\nare therefore not reported.\nOutcome measures\n(1) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale\n(HADS; Zigmund & Snaith, 1983) consists of\n14 items (7 for anxiety, 7 for depression), all\nof which are scored 0\u20133.\n(2) The Manchester Short Assessment of\nQuality of Life (Priebe et al. 1999) is a condensed\nand slightly modified version of the Lancashire\nQuality of Life Profile (Oliver et al. 1991). Two\nscores were used: mean quality of life (QL) and\nsatisfaction with mental health (SMH), each\nrated on an 8-point scale.\n(3) Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF;\nAPA, 1994) is a measure of overall psychologi-\ncal disturbance rated by the interviewer. Only\nthe GAF disability score was used in the main\nanalysis. Reliability of the interviewers was as-\nsessed using a sub-sample of 10 participants\nwho were rated by all three raters. The intra-\nclass correlation r=0.74 (p<0.01), suggested\nadequate inter-rater reliability.\nStatistical analysis\nNot all participants completed all items. There-\nfore, the exact n for each of the statistical tests\nis reported. Descriptive statistics are presented\nfor all measures followed by univariate associ-\nations between beliefs, coping and outcomes.\nMultiple regression analyses were then used to\nidentify which of the independent variables were\nthe best predictors of the outcome variables\nboth cross-sectionally at each time point and\nlongitudinally. Only variables that were univari-\nately associated with each outcome variable\n(p<0.05) at either time point were included in\nthe regression. Patient characteristics were en-\ntered into the first block using forward selection.\nSymptom severity was forced into the second\nblock to ensure that this was always controlled\nfor. Beliefs about mental health problems were\nentered into block three using forward selection.\nFinally coping strategies were entered into block\nfour using forward selection. The categorical\ncoping variables were coded as two dummy\nvariables, the first indicating whether or not a\nproblem was perceived (primary appraisal) and\nthe second indicating whether or not a particu-\nlar coping style was used.\nDespite multiple testing, a statistical signifi-\ncance level of p<0.05 was chosen for interpret-\ning the results. Given the exploratory nature of\nthe study, the risk of making a type II error was\nconsidered more detrimental to future research\nthan a type I error.\nRESULTS\nPatient characteristics\nA total of 175 people were identified as eligible\nand invited into the study. Fifty-one declined,\nleaving a total sample size of 124 (response\nrate=71%). Participants were interviewed at\ntwo time points approximately 6 months apart\n(mean=197.59 days, S.D.=77.95 days). Twenty-\ntwo people (17.7%) declined to be interviewed\nat time 2. They did not differ significantly from\nthose who were retained on any of the variables.\nA total of 94% of the sample (n=116) had a\ndiagnosis of schizophrenia (n=105), or schizo-\naffective disorder (n=11). The rest had a diag-\nnosis of psychosis (n=5), paranoid psychosis\n(n=2) or delusional disorder (n=1). The mean\nage of the sample was 38.81 years (S.D.=10.44\nyears). The average length of contact with\nmental health services was 12.05 years (S.D.=\n8.65 years). A total of 32% (n=40) of the sample\nwere receiving regular depot medication and\nBeliefs about mental health problems in schizophrenia 1167\n78% (n=97) were receiving oral antipsychotic\nmedication (most commonly atypicals). All\npsychotic symptoms had been stable for at least\n6 weeks. The mean premorbid IQ assessed\nusing the National Adult Reading Test was 97\n(S.D.=16).\nSymptom severity\nThe mean score on the PANSS positive subscale\nwas 15.12 (S.D.=5.07) and on the negative sub-\nscale was 13.12 (S.D.=4.82). There was no sig-\nnificant difference between the PANSS score at\ntime 1 and time 2 (t=1.454, df=101, p=0.149).\nBeliefs about mental health problems\nTable 1 shows mean scores per item on the\nIPQS. People reported experiencing well over\nhalf the symptoms listed. The majority of these\nwere attributed to a mental health problem.\nPeople generally viewed their problems as\nchronic, cyclical and having high negative conse-\nquences. They felt they had some personal con-\ntrol over their symptoms and that treatment\ncould offer some control. In general, people felt\nthey had a coherent understanding of their men-\ntal health problems. There were no significant\ndifferences between scores at time 1 and time 2\non any IPQS subscales.\nCoping strategies\nForty-two per cent of participants\u2019 primary ap-\npraisal was of not having any problems (n=50)\nat time 1 and they were categorized into group 1.\nOf the remaining 74 people, 36 (29% of the total\nsample) reported a high frequency of positive\ncoping strategies and 21 (17%) used negative\ncoping strategies.\nAt time 2, there was an increase in the pro-\nportion of people who did not perceive any\nproblems.\nOutcome measures\nThe mean score on HADS anxiety was 9.22\n(S.D.=4.50). The mean depression score was\n7.86 (S.D.=4.34).\nThe mean overall quality of life rating was\n4.36 (S.D.=0.85), which reflects \u2018neither satisfied\nnor dissatisfied\u2019. Satisfaction with mental health\nhad a mean score of 3.63 (S.D.=1.54), suggest-\ning that overall the sample were less satisfied\nwith their mental health than with other aspects\nof their lives.\nThe mean score on the GAF disability sub-\nscale was 48.28 (S.D.=11.30). This is consistent\nwith \u2018serious impairment in social, occupational,\nor school functioning\u2019.\nThere were no significant differences between\nscores at time 1 and time 2 on any of these\nmeasures.\nUnivariate analyses\nBeliefs about mental health problems and coping\nstrategies\nTable 1 shows the results of ANOVAs to com-\npare the three groups of people using different\ncoping styles on each of the belief dimensions\nTable 1.

Among those who did perceive a\nproblem, high frequency of positive coping\nstrategies (group 3) was associated with an in-\ncreased perception of personal control than\nthose who reported few positive coping strate-\ngies (group 2, p=0.002).

Use of negative coping strategies was\npositively associated with increased identity\nscores (p=0.028), and more negative conse-\nquences (p=0.044). At time 2 there were no sig-\nnificant differences between any of the groups.\nAssociations between independent variables and\noutcome measures\nUnivariate relationships between the indepen-\ndent variables (patient characteristics, symptom\nseverity, beliefs and coping) and dependent vari-\nables (outcome appraisal measures) are shown\nin Tables 2 and 3.

Symptom severity was associated\nwith poorer outcome appraisal on all measures\nat both time points. All belief dimensions were\nassociated with at least one of the outcome ap-\npraisal measures. Poorer outcome appraisal was\nconsistently associated with a stronger identity,\na more chronic and more cyclical timeline,\ngreater perceived negative consequences, less\ncontrol and less sense of a coherent under-\nstanding of mental health problems at both time\npoints.\nOutcomes also significantly differed between\ngroups on the coping variables at time 1.

Longi-\ntudinal analyses were also performed in which\ntime 1 independent variables were used to pre-\ndict outcome scores at time 2 (see Table 5).\nScores on the outcome appraisal measures at\ntime 1 were controlled for by entering them\ninto an additional first block in the regression\nanalysis.\nTo check how well the regression equations\nfitted the data, the standardized residuals were\nchecked. None had an absolute value greater\nthan three, suggesting adequate fit of the data\n(Field, 2000).\nHADS anxiety\nSymptoms alone were able to account for\n11.3% of the variance in anxiety at time 1. With\nthe addition of beliefs about symptoms, this in-\ncreased to 34.2%. High negative consequences,\nstrong identity and lack of faith in the ability of\ntreatment approaches to control symptoms were\nall associated with higher anxiety, though treat-\nment control became non-significant in the final\nmodel. The addition of coping failed to account\nfor any additional variance.\nCross-sectional analysis of data collected at\ntime 2 showed consistent findings over time. The\ntotal adjusted R2 was 43.5%.

Coping\nfailed to account for any additional variance at\ntime 2.\nThe longitudinal analysis showed that the\nonly significant predictor of anxiety at time 2\nwas anxiety at time 1.

Greater symptom severity (sb=0.177)\nand a more chronic perception of timeline (sb=\n0.279) were also direct predictors of greater\ndepression at time 2. Coping did not account for\nany additional variance.\nIn the longitudinal analysis time 1 depression\nscores accounted for 48.9% of the variance\nin depression scores at time 2. High negative\nconsequences at time 1 also significantly pre-\ndicted later depression.\nQL\nLower symptom severity score was associated\nwith higher QL and accounted for approxi-\nmately 23.8% of the variance at time 1. With the\naddition of beliefs about symptoms, the amount\nof variance accounted for increased to 51.5%.\nPerception of low negative consequences and\ngreater personal control predicted higher per-\nceived QL scores. Primary appraisal of not\nhaving a problem increased the amount of vari-\nance explained a small but significant amount\nto 57.8%.\nThe data at time 2 confirmed low negative\nconsequences as the main predictor of high QL\n(sb=x0.555). Control was important again,\nthough high treatment control (sb=0.289)\nwas a stronger predictor of QL than personal\ncontrol at time 2. Neither coping nor symptom\nseverity were significant direct predictors of\nQL at time 2.\nIn the longitudinal analysis quality of life at\ntime 2 was strongly predicted by quality of life\nat time 1. However, perceived negative conse-\nquences was also significant and increased the\namount of variance accounted for from 48.0%\nto 55.0%. Negative coping was able to account\nfor a small but significant additional 2.2% of\nvariance.\nSatisfaction with mental health (SMH)\nSymptom severity was not a direct significant\npredictor of SMH at time 1. Perception of low\nnegative consequences, greater treatment control\nand attributing a higher proportion of symp-\ntoms to factors other than mental health prob-\nlems or medication effects was associated with\nincreased SMH problems. These beliefs were\nable to account for 38.4% of the variance.\nPrimary appraisal increased this to 47%. People\nwho did not perceive themselves as having any\nproblems reported higher satisfaction with their\nmental health.\nTime 2 analysis supported the important role\nof beliefs about consequences in accounting for\nthe greatest amount of variance in SMH. How-\never, symptom severity was a direct predictor\nat time 2 (sb=x0.232). Symptoms accounted\nfor approximately 11.5% of the variance in\nsatisfaction, and beliefs about consequences\n(sb=x0.496) increased this to 33.9%. Primary\nappraisal and coping variables were unable to\naccount for any additional variance.\nSMH at time 1 positively predicted satisfac-\ntion at time 2 and accounted for approximately\n34.7% of the variance. Higher perceived nega-\ntive consequences at time 1 significantly pre-\ndicted lower satisfaction at time 2 accounting\nfor an additional 7.8% of variance. Symptom\nseverity was not a significant predictor.\nGAF-disability\nSymptom severity accounted for 21.7% of the\nvariance in GAF scores with fewer symptoms\nbeing associated with higher GAF ratings.\nBeliefs about mental health problems increased\nthis to 34.2%with fewer perceived negative con-\nsequences, and attributing a higher proportion\nof symptoms to medication effects both being\nassociated with higher GAF ratings. Primary\nappraisal increased the amount of variance ac-\ncounted for to 39.3%. People who did not per-\nceive themselves as having any problem received\nhigher GAF ratings.\nVery similar results were found using the\ntime 2 data. Higher functioning was associated\nwith lower symptom severity (sb=x0.368), and\nfewer negative consequences (sb=x0.305).\nGAF scores were also higher for females than\nfor males (sb=0.205). Symptom severity ac-\ncounted for approximately 17% of the variance\nand negative consequences increased this to\n35.3%. None of the coping variables accounted\nfor any additional variance.\nThere was very little change in GAF\nscores between time 1 and time 2. GAF ratings\nat time 1 accounted for 68.9% of the vari-\nance in GAF ratings at time 2. None of the\nother variables accounted for any additional\nvariance.\n1172 F. Lobban et al.\nDISCUSSION\nThe main findings from the study support the\nSRM in showing that variation in beliefs about\nmental health problems is associated with sig-\nnificant variation in appraisal of outcome both\ncross-sectionally and longitudinally.\nIn the cross-sectional analysis the amount of\nvariation accounted for by beliefs in anxiety\n(22.9% at time 1\u201326.8% at time 2) and in\ndepression (28.1% at time 1\u201341.5% at time 2)\nis directly comparable to that found in physi-\ncal health studies using similar methodologies\n(Rutter & Rutter, 2000; Edwards et al. 2001;\nFortune et al. 2002). In all of these studies be-\nliefs about negative consequences were most\nstrongly associated with outcome. Coherence\nwas also an important predictor of depression in\nthis study but was not assessed in the physical\nhealth studies. Perceived QL and SMH have\nalso been used as measures of outcome ap-\npraisal in physical health. Rutter & Rutter\n(2002) showed that for patients with IBS 26%\nof variance in perceived QL (compared to\n27.7\u201338.6% in this study) and 28% of variance\nin satisfaction with mental health (compared to\n24.0\u201322.4% in this study) could be accounted\nfor by illness beliefs with high negative conse-\nquences again showing the strongest relation-\nship.\nThe GAF has not been used in previous\nstudies but was included here as a non self-\nreport measure in order to test whether relation-\nships between beliefs and outcome appraisal\nwere largely a function of them being from a\ncommon source. The results from theGAF show\nthat beliefs accounted for significant amounts of\nvariance at both time points. As with the above\nanalyses, perceived negative consequences were\nthe strongest predictors of GAF ratings.\nIn this study we attempted to examine how\nbeliefs at one time point could be used to predict\noutcome appraisal at a second time point.\nHowever, there was very little change over the\n6-month period in either beliefs about mental\nhealth problems or outcome appraisal. Despite\nthis, perception of greater negative conse-\nquences at time 1 did predict greater depression,\nlower perceived quality of life, and less satisfac-\ntion with mental health at time 2. The amounts\nof variance accounted for by beliefs were small\n(2% for depression, 7% for QL and 6% for\nSMH) but comparable to those reported in\nlongitudinal studies in physical health (e.g.\nScharloo et al. 2000), suggesting that beliefs\nabout health problems are at least as important\nin mental health as they are in physical health.\nOne reason for the amount of variance being so\nsmall is that the outcome appraisal measures\nare very general and therefore likely to be influ-\nenced by variables other than those linked to\nhealth, such as relationships, housing, work etc.\nThe clinical significance of the variance in\noutcome appraisal accounted for by beliefs in\nboth physical and mental health problems is\nunclear. Intervention studies are needed to test\nboth the causal mechanism of the relationship\nbetween beliefs and outcome and the potential\nto change this relationship in a way that has a\nmeaningful impact on peoples\u2019 lives. Petrie et al.\n(2002) reported the results of a Randomized\nControlled Trial using a three-session early in-\ntervention to challenge illness perceptions fol-\nlowing a myocardial infarction. They found a\nreduction in negative beliefs, and reduced delay\nin returning to work for the intervention group.\nIntervention studies specifically focused on\nchallenging negative beliefs about mental health\nproblems have not yet been reported.\nThe assertion that coping mediates the re-\nlationship between illness beliefs and outcome\nappraisal was not supported in this study.\nBeliefs had significant direct associations with\noutcome appraisal and coping generally ac-\ncounted for little or no additional variance.\nHowever, firm conclusions cannot be drawn as\nthere were considerable difficulties in accurately\nmeasuring coping. In this study, the reduction\nof specific strategies to categorical variables\nmeasuring positive and negative strategies is\nproblematic in that fails to take into account the\neffectiveness of strategies for the individual, how\nconsistently they are used, and the appropriate-\nness of strategies to different settings. Finally,\nunivariate associations between beliefs and\ncoping suggest some degree of shared variance\nthat is difficult to disentangle using these stat-\nistical methods (though tolerance statistics were\nchecked to ensure that these associations were\nnot causing multi-colinearity in the analyses).\nDespite these problems, the finding that\ncoping is not a mediator has potentially import-\nant implications of the mechanism underlying\nthe association between beliefs and outcome.\nBeliefs about mental health problems in schizophrenia 1173\nThe finding is consistent with a number of\nphysical health studies, which have failed to find\nstrong evidence for the importance of coping\n(Moss-Morris et al. 1996; Heijmans, 1999;\nSteed et al. 1999). These studies suggest that\nrather than beliefs guiding attempts to cope,\nwhich in turn impact on outcome appraisal as\nthe SRM suggests, beliefs about health prob-\nlems may have a direct effect on the outcome.\nThis is consistent with a more general cognitive\nmodels of psychosis as described by Morrison\n(2001), Birchwood et al. (2000) and Garety et al.\n(2001).\nThis study has several further limitations that\nneed to be taken into account when interpreting\nthe findings. The assessment of beliefs in this\nstudy does not include some potentially im-\nportant dimensions. Beliefs about the causes of\nmental health problems and beliefs about per-\nsonal responsibility and blame are assessed by\nthe IPQS, but did not form internally consistent\nsubscales and so were not used in this analysis\n(Lobban et al. in press). The important role of\nbeliefs about specific treatments has also been\nhighlighted in previous literature (Horne &\nWeinman, 1995), but were not assessed.\nThe longitudinal analysis in this study showed\nlittle change over time. Future research may\nfocus on longer time periods and on events that\nmay be likely to be associated with change, such\nas interventions, or relapse.\nFinally, there are important differences be-\ntween physical and mental health problems that\nmay limit the applicability of the SRM to psy-\nchosis. The SRM assumes that people hold\nmodels of illness in their heads that can be ac-\ncessed by questioning. In psychosis, the nature\nof the disorder may impair the ability or the need\nto do this. In physical health problems there\nmay be a desire to identify a disease entity that\ncan be diagnosed and separated from the sense\nof self. In psychosis the distinction between self\nand illness is often more blurred and this may\nmake the ability to create an illness model more\ndifficult. The greater degree of stigma associated\nwith psychosis may increase the impact of the\nsocial environment on the development and ex-\npression of beliefs in a way that is not currently\naddressed in current applications of the SRM.\nDespite these limitations, the results have\nimportant clinical implications. They suggest\nthat the current focus on symptom severity as\na main outcome measure in clinical trials is\nperhaps unwarranted. Symptom severity ac-\ncounted for some variance in outcome appraisal\nfor individuals in this study, but perceived con-\nsequences, controllability and a sense of coher-\nence were also very important. This highlights\nimportant opportunities for interventions that\naim to challenge negative appraisals using well\ndeveloped cognitive and behavioural therapies.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors thank Professor Chris Hatton and\nProfessor Nicholas Tarrier for their assistance\nwith rating the coping strategies and helpful\ncomments on the final draft of the paper.\nThanks also go toKate Hancock and Zoe Rivers\nwho carried out some of the assessment inter-\nviews.
