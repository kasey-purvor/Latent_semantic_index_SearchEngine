Essentially, this study corrects an inconsistency or error related to fluid-mass conservation in an existing expression for the t-matrix (wave-induced deformation) of a communicating cavity, a cavity that is isolated with respect to stress propagation (through the solid matrix) but that can exchange fluid mass with other cavities because of global and\/or local pressure gradients associated with passage of a long viscoelastic wave.
