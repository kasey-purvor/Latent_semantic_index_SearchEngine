Fellenz \n \nABSTRACT. Despite becoming one of the most active research areas in organizational \nbehaviour, the field of organizational justice has stayed at a safe distance from moral \nquestions of values, as well as from critical questions regarding the implications of \nfairness considerations on the status quo of power relations in today's organizations. We \nargue that both organizational justice research and the managerial practices it informs \nlack reflexivity. This manifests itself in two possible hypocrisies of fairness. Managers \nmay apply organizational justice knowledge but fail to increase the actual levels of \nfairness in employment relations. Researchers, on the other hand, may claim to promote \nfairness through their work while actually providing managers with tools that enable or \neven encourage them to feed the hypocrisy of fairness identified above.  \nAs part of our argument, we identify three types of mechanisms managers may \nuse to influence and manage the formation of fairness perceptions. We consider how the \nexercise of power is related to the potential application of organizational justice \nknowledge across individual, interpersonal and social levels. Our approach makes power \ndynamics and moral implications salient, and questions the purely subjectivist view of \njustice researchers that deliberately discards normative aspects. The questions opened up \nby considering alternative mechanisms for creating fairness perceptions have led us to \nformulate a research agenda for organizational justice research that takes multiple \nstakeholder interests, power dynamics and ethical implications into account. We believe \nthat the fields of organizational justice and normative justice can benefit from combined \nresearch. \n \nKEY WORDS: justice, fairness, power, organizational behavior, managerialist research \n 1\n 2\n \nMarion Fortin (Ph.D., Trinity College Dublin) is Lecturer in Organisational Behaviour at the \nDurham Business School, Durham University.

The promise that justice \nresearchers make to managers is that \u201cbeing fair costs little and pays off handsomely\u201d \n(Brockner, 2006, p. 122). Despite the high levels of activity in the field, justice \nresearchers have rarely asked moral questions or critical questions regarding the \nimplications of fairness considerations on organizational reality.  \nWhile outcomes and antecedents of perceived (un-)fair treatment, or reactive \njustice, have been the focus of a larger body of research in organizations, the proactive \ncreation of fairness or unfairness (proactive fairness) has received little attention in field \nresearch up to date (Bies and Tripp, 1995, p. 200). The unfolding of justice or injustice in \norganizations remains largely a black box. There are many potential routes towards \ncreating fairness perceptions. Managers might, for example, put in place procedures \nincluding criteria typically perceived as fair, change their basis for allocation decisions, \ntheir information policy, or they might try to impact underlying justice norm choice or \nreferent choice for employees. One way these fairness perceptions are created is through \nthe framing of situations.  Frames are offered by key stakeholders, such as union leaders \nand management. One example is that unions often promote equality as a basis for \ndistribution, while management promotes merit-based allocations. In short, justice \njudgments may not only be changed through evaluating actions and events within a \nparticular normative framework of justice, but may change through frames, ideologies, \nthrough influencing or replacing the normative framework itself. The way that justice \njudgments are influenced by ideologies, value judgments and power has received very \nlittle attention.  \nIn this paper, we argue that the lack of ethical considerations and critical \nreflection in organizational justice brings about two dangers, which we term the \nhypocrisies of organizational justice in research and in practice. Justice researchers who \nadopt exclusively subjective conceptualizations of organizational justice and tailor their \nwork to the benefit of management may lose sight of the impact of their work in terms of \nnormative justice. Managers in turn may apply OJ theory and findings without increasing \nor even considering the actual levels of fairness in employment relations.  \nWe argue that a broadening of the focus, the methods, and the theories of \norganizational justice will be necessary in order to investigate and integrate the different \nmechanisms that can underlie the shaping of justice judgments and the preventing of \nreactions to injustice. In turn, such work is expected to significantly expand the scope of \nthe field of organizational justice and enable it to deal with a broader range of questions, \nstakeholders and real world situations. Certainly, the field of normative ethics could also \nbenefit from such integration, as organizational fairness issues in particular related to \nprocess and conduct have rarely been the focus in normative conceptions of justice to \ndate. \nBelow, we briefly describe and discuss the history of the field and the nature of \ncurrent OJ research. We point out the implications of the confluence of a social-\npsychological orientation and the more recent adoption of a managerialist ethos in the OJ \nfield. The shortcomings of the subjectivist conception of justice (fairness) will be \ndemonstrated by juxtaposing it with normative conceptions of justice. Based on this, we \nbriefly outline the benefits of a radical critique of the field and make recommendations \nfor future research.  In the following, we describe the dangers of a hypocrisy of justice in \nmanagerial practice, and of a hypocrisy of justice in OJ research. Finally we make the \nargument that not only can organizational justice benefit from the integration of \n 3\nnormative justice theories, but that normative perspectives can also be enriched by \ndrawing on organizational justice.  \n \n \nThe Nature of Organizational Justice Research \n \nOJ deals with the role of fairness as a consideration in the workplace (Greenberg, 1990, \np. 400), or, more specifically, with employee\u2019s perceptions of fairness in their \nemployment relationship (Folger and Cropanzano, 1998). The terms justice and fairness \nare commonly used interchangeably (see Cohen-Charash and Spector, 2001; Sheppard et \nal., 1992). The field was born in the 1960s, when a few contributions introduced the \nnotion of distributive justice, or the perceived fairness of outcomes (Adams, 1963; \nAdams, 1965; Blau, 1964; Homans, 1961). Distributive justice was defined as a \nsubjective perception derived from internal considerations, an intrapersonal judgment \npotentially informed but not determined by external normative frameworks. This \nsubjective conception of justice departed fundamentally from the traditional \nphilosophical perspective that adopted a normative, externally determined view of justice \nthat reflected such characteristics as impartiality, objectivity, and shared standards and \nnorms. Equity was at first seen as the dominant criterion that people used in their fairness \njudgment process, but later on other subjectively used distribution rules such as equality \nand need were introduced (Deutsch, 1975). Some studies in game theory and economics \nhave investigated in how far different normative theories are applied by people in their \nsubjective judgments, and a review of these studies has recently been provided by Konow \n(2003). Konow grouped different distributive fairness norms into three main theoretical \nstreams: 1) equality and need, 2) utilitarianism and welfare economics, 3) equity and \ndesert, and reviewed empirical evidence on the prevalence of the different norms, in \nparticular in lab studies and surveys. Konow summarizes: \u201cFairness views are best \nexplained by an integrated approach that acknowledges the influence of the three \nprinciples of justice, whereby the weight on each is determined by the context\u201d (p. 1190). \nThis is probably the most thorough review of the subjective use of different normative \n 4\nprinciples to date. While research found that people may use different norms to judge \nfairness, little work has been conducted to see when which norm is used, and no \npublished work has attempted to assess the appropriateness of a specific norm in a \nparticular situation from a normative or moral point of view. The subjective conception \nof justice itself and its implications have not been questioned.  \nThe face of justice research was changed by the arising focus on procedural \njustice, or the perceived fairness of the procedures used to determine an outcome \n(Thibaut and Walker, 1975). Similar to distributive justice research, the choice of criteria \nfor procedural fairness has been found to be context-dependent (McFarlin and Sweeney, \n2001), but the rationale behind choosing particular criteria of procedural fairness over \nothers has not been the focus of investigations, and ethical implications have not been \nconsidered.  \nImportant and potentially relevant publications from related fields such as \npolitical philosophy and industrial relations (e.g., Fox, 1974; Hirschman, 1970; Nozick, \n1974; Rawls, 1971) were noted and occasionally used, but none of them significantly \ninfluenced the development of the OJ field. In the later part of the 1970s the weight of \nresearch activities shifted from a mainly social-psychological area of inquiry, with other \nareas and disciplines involved along the way (e.g., political philosophy, sociology, law, \ncognitive psychology, and management), to an integrative part of mainstream \norganizational behavior. At the same time, Bies and colleagues (Bies, 1986; Bies and \nMoag, 1986; Bies and Shapiro, 1987; Bies, 1987; Bies et al., 1988; Bies and Shapiro, \n1988) proposed a concept extension to procedural justice by identifying the interpersonal \ncomponent named interactional justice (e.g., Greenberg, 1987). Recent work has again \nconceptually and empirically separated these dimensions and split of interactional justice \ninto two constituent dimensions named informational justice (referring to explanations \nand social accounts) and interpersonal justice (referring to respectful consideration and \nsensitivity) (e.g., Colquitt, 2001). Since its emergence in the 1960s, the field of OJ has \nretained a strong social-psychological focus, which is reflected in the continuing \nimportant role of laboratory-based research, and in the entirely subjective conception of \nfairness or justice.  \n 5\nOver the last twenty years the field has also oriented itself according to the \npragmatic concerns of managers and organizations. We are not the first to point out this \nmanagerialist ethos of the OJ field (Bies and Tripp, 1995; 2002). OJ research has been \npreoccupied with managing employee justice perceptions to counter negative attitudinal \nand behavioral reactions to managerial actions and organizational systems. Brockner \nrecently described the practical use of organisational justice research and findings for \nreaders of the HBR, and made \u201cthe business case for fair process\u201d (Brockner, 2006, p. \n123). \u201cUsing process fairness, companies could spend a lot less money and still have \nmore satisfied employees\u201d (Brockner, 2006, p. 124). \nThe research topics that justice scholars choose are generally of immediate \nrelevance for practicing managers. Specific topics include links between justice \nperceptions and organizationally relevant behavioral and attitudinal reactions (e.g., \nlikelihood of legal action, (Bies and Tyler, 1993); job performance, (Greenberg, 1988); \nco-operation, (Pfeffer and Langton, 1993); compliance with organizational rules \n(Greenberg, 1994); perceived stress, (Zohar, 1995); and job satisfaction (Singer, 1993). \nOther OJ research also focuses on issues with high pragmatic managerial value, such as \nantecedents of fairness perceptions under managerial control such as pay and other \noutcomes (see Adams and Freedman, 1976 for a review), voice (Folger, 1977; Thibaut \nand Walker, 1975), or explanations (Shapiro, 1991). Much work has also appeared that \nlinks fairness perceptions to specific issues of fundamental importance to managers, such \nas conflict management, downsizing, layoffs, organizational change, and human resource \npractices such as recruitment, selection, and staffing (for an overview see Folger and \nCropanzano, 1998). Some recent, more conceptually oriented streams of research include, \nfor example, investigations aimed at advancing current understanding about how fairness \njudgments are formed and what information is used in this process (e.g., Folger and \nCropanzano, 2001; Lind, 2001; Van den Bos et al., 2001). Yet again, this research does \nnot consider moral frameworks and implications. \nIn fact, the appearance of organizational justice on the center stage of \norganizational research may well reflect the view that the \u201cobject for management control \nare decreasingly labor power and behavior and increasingly the mindpower and \nsubjectivities of employees.\u201d (Alverson and Deetz, 1996, p. 192). While \u201c[o]rganizational \n 6\njustice researchers have focused almost exclusively on explaining how the justice concept \ncan serve management interests\u201d (Bies and Tripp, 1995, p. 200), the managerialist \nperspective guiding organizational justice research has not been conducive to broader, \ncritical, and more multi-faceted insights into fairness and justice as part of organizational \ndynamics and individual experiences in organizations.  \nIn summary, current OJ research reflects the disciplinary origins of the field as \nwell as particular pragmatic concerns of its practitioner audience. While adding field-\nbased cross-sectional survey research to the laboratory approaches that have marked its \nbeginnings, the historically determined subjective conception of its central variable and \nthe managerialist ethos adopted in the last two decades define a highly homogeneous and \nlargely uncritical field of study. In accepting this status quo of OJ research, however, \n\u201cjustice researchers [\u2026] are falling short of [their] moral responsibility to question how \n[their] efforts may unwittingly contribute to perpetuating, not ameliorating, injustice in \nthe workplace\u201d (Bies and Tripp, 1995, p. 200).  \nThis is the reason for the challenge inherent in our radical approach to re-view the \nfield of OJ research. The absence of critical voices, and what we see as a substantial lack \nof reflexivity in OJ research and practice, prevents important questions from being asked \n\u2013 questions both about the conduct of OJ research, and about its implications for \nmanagerial and organizational practice. Critical and reflexive probes into OJ may surface \nnew questions, including the role of ethics and values in OJ research, the implications of \nfairness considerations on the status quo of power relations in today\u2019s organizations, the \nchoices of research questions and the overarching managerialist research agenda of the \nfield, and the role of research methods in the further development of the field.  \nOur radical critique of the orientation of current OJ research is not meant to be a \nrejection of the disciplinary heritage of the field. It is also not a rejection of the \nimportance of addressing the concerns of managerial practitioners, who are important \nexternal stakeholders. We see this as appropriate and even necessary to avoid pragmatic \nirrelevance. However, we believe that the adoption of the purely subjective definition of \njustice, the lack of references to normative justice conceptions, and the exclusion of \nmultiple stakeholder interests create problems for the research area in a number of ways. \n 7\nThese include (a) what questions are asked, (b) how these questions are answered, and (c) \nwhat the impact of the answers presented is.  \nIn the next section, we introduce different views on justice and fairness: Firstly \nwe contrast normative views of justice with the subjective definition of fairness presented \nabove, and then develop alternative views on organizational justice, drawing on a \ntaxonomy of power exercises by Steven Lukes (2005). Finally, we discuss the \nimplications of an unreflected acceptance of historically or externally determined \nconventions for OJ research and practice \n \n \nNormative views of justice \n \nThe study of justice has been a topic in ethics and philosophy at least since Plato and \nSocrates, and philosophical and ethical thinking about justice has shaped the way people \nsee the world. Mankind has long tried to answer the question, \u201cwhat is justice?\u201d Yet the \nquestion seems to remain as open as ever, and it seems unsure if a final answer can ever \nbe found (Kelsen, 2000). Justice has been conceptualised in many different ways by \nphilosophers and thinkers: as a natural law based on contracts (Hobbes, 1947), as an \ninstrument for societal order for which no universal standard exists (e.g., Mill, 1940 ), as \na consequence of the economic system that is used as a manipulative instrument to \npreserve and justify a societal order (Marx, 1929), or as a result of historical associations \nand historical rights (Nozick, 1974). In philosophy, justice has been thought about as an \nattribute of societal order, as a human virtue, or as an attribute of an act (Kelsen, 2000). \nEthical theories are often classified into utilitarian, deontic, and virtue ethics \napproaches. Utilitarianism defines the right action as the one that maximises the overall \ngood \u201cthat is, it must maximise good (or minimize bad) from the standpoint of the entire \nhuman community\u201d (Donaldson and Werhane, 2002, p. 3).  \n Deontology, on the other hand, focuses on \u201cthe rules and principles that guide \nactions\u201d (Donaldson and Werhane, 2002) . This includes so-called Kantian Ethics, \nconcerned with duty and universal principles, but also social contract approaches, such as \n 8\nRawls\u2019 theory of justice where the principles and rules that rational actors would decide \non in an ideal situation are used as a benchmark for rightness (Rawls, 1971).                    \n  The third stream, Virtue Ethics, is sometimes subsumed under the other \ntheories. Solomon (1992) identifies six central consideration for virtue ethics in \norganizations: community, excellence, role identity, holism, integrity and judgment. \nVirtue ethics is concerned with good character, and with taking into account the situation \nand the specific people involved, giving a role to good judgments as opposed to just \nfollowing particular rules (which is particular important in situations of conflicting roles \nand dilemmas). \n Of course, there are many important differentiations of contributions within each \nof these three streams, which may in turn arrive at different judgments when evaluating \nthe \u2018fairness\u2019 or \u2018justice\u2019 of any act or situation.  \n A normative contribution that may prove particularly useful in organisational \ncontexts is the theory of justice provided by Finnis (1980), as it is not restricted to \nparticular institutions or to an overall societal context. Finnis develops a normative theory \nof justice that builds on Aristotelian thinking, and as such is closely linked to virtue \nethics. For Finnis, the objective of justice is \u201cthe flourishing of all members of the \ncommunity\u201d (p. 174). In order to achieve justice, a number of criteria need to be balanced \n(including need, capacity and contributions, risk creation, etc). The overriding \nconsideration however is \u2018practical reasonableness\u2019, which takes the particular \ncircumstances of particular people into account. \u201cThe requirements of justice, then, are \nthe concrete implications of the basic requirement of practical reasonableness that one is \nto favour and foster the common good of one\u2019s communities\u201d (p. 164).  \n While justice and morality are not synonymous, justice is often seen as a \nbenchmark for judging the morality of an action or situation. Of course, there may be \nexceptions, such as when in utilitarian thinking an injustice for one or for a few is judged \nto be moral when it serves the greater good or justice for many. Yet justice is used as a \ncentral consideration when evaluating so-called stakeholder interests in business. \nBusiness ethics scholars have pointed out that in organisational contexts the welfare of all \nstakeholders, not only the stockholders\u2019 welfare, is to be considered (Werhane and \nFreedman, 1999). Philips (1997) refers to the centrality of fairness in this context: \n 9\n\u201cWhenever persons or groups of persons voluntarily accept the benefits of a mutually \nbeneficial scheme of co-operation requiring sacrifice or contribution on the parts of the \nparticipants and there exists the possibility of free-riding, obligations of fairness are \ncreated among the participants in the co-operative scheme in proportion to the benefits \naccepted\u201d (p. 57). \n Organizational justice in contrast is defined as perceived justice. The fulfillment \nof normative requirements of a theory of justice does not necessarily mean that justice is \nalso perceived by any or all stakeholders, and in turn, normative injustice does not \nnecessarily result in injustice perceptions. Thus, employees\u2019 (or managers\u2019) fairness \nperceptions can be compatible with ethical and normative fairness, but they may not be. \nAs an employees\u2019 justice judgments change over the time of their employment, such \njudgments can become more or less compatible with a particular normative fairness \nstandard. \n \n \nA radical view \n \nIn this paper, we develop exemplary alternative views on justice in organizations by \ndrawing on a taxonomy of power exercises from political sociology, developed by Steven \nLukes (2005). The first dimension of power exercise identified by Lukes focuses on \nobservable conflict in decision making. Such explicit conflict about decision making \nreflects the traditional pluralist approach to the exercise of power (see for example Dahl, \n1957). Decision-making arenas are open to the participation of any organized group, and \nthe more powerful groups will be able to get their way after open discussion and struggle. \nThe second dimension of power exercise has been added by Bachrach and Baratz (1963) \nwho argue that power is not only exercised in pluralist open discourse, but that it can be \nexercised in more subtle forms; for example, through agenda setting or preventing groups \nfrom raising issues. In this view, not only the issues that are talked about and decided on \nare an important aspect of power exercise, but also the exclusion of issues that are not \nconsidered. There are some directly observable power mechanisms, like force, sanctions, \n 10\nand manipulation, while other mechanisms are not directly observable, such as \npreventing others from acting through anticipated reactions, or through sums of \nincremental decisions. Lukes proposes a third dimension of power mechanisms, \naccording to which power can be used to pre-empt manifest conflict from arising. One \nform of power is to shape the conception of issues and influencing wants of others. The \nmechanisms of power now include much \u2018subtler\u2019 forms, such as the creation of social \nmyths and the use of language and symbols. Meaning is socially constructed, including \nboth observable and indirect mechanisms: the less powerful may be manipulated in terms \nof not recognizing grievances, in their conception of self and group, not realizing who is \nresponsible, not seeing possible alternatives, and not knowing effective strategies.  \nWe apply Lukes\u2019 three dimensional framework of power exercise to managerial \nactions regarding employees\u2019 fairness perceptions, and their behavioral and attitudinal \nresponses to unfairness. This leads us to distinguish three categories of managerial \nactions for managing and creating employee fairness experiences over time. The three \ncategories are entitled \u2018responding\u2019, \u2018preventing\u2019 and \u2018shaping\u2019, and differ with regards \nto power mechanisms and time frame. Each category implies different challenges for \norganizational justice research, and poses different questions for organizational practice.  \nFor each of the three categories of fairness mechanisms presented, we will outline \nimplications for research and for managerial practice in turn. We will illustrate aspects of \nthe three dimensions using the example of a firm that makes a significant part of its \nworkforce redundant. Overall, the three mechanisms demonstrate the limitations of a \npurely subjectivist justice definition.  \n \n \nThe first dimension \n \nThe first category of managerial actions we present is the one that uses mechanisms that \nhave been recognized, theorized and studied by OJ researchers. These actions (and the \nresearchers studying them unreflexively) take perceptions of justice at face value: if \npeople think they are treated fairly, then they are treated fairly. This category, which we \n 11\nterm \u2018responding\u2019, parallels the first dimension of Lukes\u2019 taxonomy of power (Lukes, \n2005), assuming observable conflict of interests. In this context, such conflicts arise \nbecause managerial decisions that reflect organizational interests may not be perceived as \nfair by employees. According to this view, conflicts of interest are brought into the open, \nand the more powerful parties prevail in these open conflicts. If no complaint or \ngrievance is voiced, it is assumed that there are none. Paralleling this, if no concerns \nabout injustice are voiced, justice researchers and practitioners may assume that there is \nno injustice.  \nFor managerial practitioners, this implies that in order to foster positive fairness \nperceptions of employees, they need to design outcomes, procedures, and interpersonal \ntreatments according to commonly agreed criteria as identified in fairness research, i.e., \norganizations are \u2018responding\u2019 to a set of required criteria. If management does not fulfill \nthe expectations of justice that employees bring to the workplace, then an open struggle \nabout these issues of fairness is to result. Who prevails in this struggle depends on the \nrelative power distribution between management and employees, but any differences are \nexpected to be out in the open. \nIn the context of our redundancy example, the company\u2019s employees may \nperceive distributive injustice (they feel that the redundancies are undeserved), \nprocedural injustice (they feel the procedures for deciding on redundancies are unjust and \nbiased), and informational injustice (they feel that they have not been given sufficient and \ntimely information). In this case, the employees remaining after the layoffs (survivors) \nare expected to respond or even retaliate through negative attitudinal and behavioral \nreactions, and laid off employees are likely to file wrongful termination lawsuits. The \nonly way for the company to avoid these reactions is to fulfill particular requirements of \njustice:  \nDistributive justice perceptions could either be improved through changing the \nredundancy conditions or even abandoning the redundancy plan. They could also be \nimproved either through procedural or informational fairness. The so-called \u2018fair process \neffect\u2019 (Folger and Cropanzano, 1998) is the finding that under fair process conditions \n(e.g., consistent, representative, unbiased procedures) even unfavourable outcomes could \nbe perceived as fair (Van den Bos et al., 1998). Bies and Shapiro (1987) also found that \n 12\npeople with negative outcomes were more likely to accept a procedure as fair when an \nexplanation was offered, an effect which could be termed a \u2018fair information effect\u2019. \nThus, overall fairness perceptions for both survivors and terminated employees can only \nbe improved through responding to a set of criteria that employees perceive to be fair. \nManagement may, of course, respond to employees\u2019 fairness criteria by just going \nthrough the motions, or \u2018ticking the right boxes\u2019. Thus, while responding through \nfulfilling the criteria improves overall fairness perceptions, it does not necessarily imply a \nparticularly morally astute organization. Responding does not rely on the moral \njudgments of managers or the organization. Brockner (2006) also uses the example of \ncompanies downsizing. During layoffs company B may spend a lot less on severance \npackages than company A, but because company B\u2019s managers explain the reasons for \nthe layoffs properly and also express regret and offer sincere apologies, company B is \nlikely to face less wrongful termination lawsuits. Brockner calls this the \u2018business case \nfor fair process\u2019 (p. 123). It can even be argued that the conscious management of \nfairness criteria can be used in an amoral or even immoral way. MacCoun (2005) refers \nto the \u2018fair process effect\u2019 and states that knowledge about this effect may enable decision \nmakers to improve fairness perceptions without any costly outcome concessions. \nPeople\u2019s \u201cpoignant desire for voice and dignity \u2026 [leaves them] potentially vulnerable to \nmanipulation and exploitation by those who control resources and the processes for \ndistributing them.\u201d (MacCoun, 2005, p. 193). \nTraditional OJ research that remains within this first paradigm of \u2018responding\u2019 \nassumes a set of fairness criteria that is similar across employees and organizations. \nBased on this assumption, the perceived fairness of outcomes, procedures, and treatment \nimplies the presence of a commonly agreed set of fairness criteria. \n Statistical\/quantitative and experimental research is appropriate to answer most \nof the questions involved, such as which dimension of fairness perceptions appears to be \nlinked to which reactions, and whether there are interaction effects. Also, a relatively \nshort-term observation is likely to provide insights into the processes involved as people \nargue openly about outcomes and procedures, and remain within stable reference systems \nof norms about fairness. The traditional cross-sectional survey methods employed in \nmanagement research and the laboratory-based approaches common in social psychology \n 13\nsuffice to investigate most issues that arise within this mindset. Critical aspects do not \ngenerally find attention in this context.  \nHowever, even within this paradigm the field of organizational justice could (but \ncurrently does not) address questions regarding ethical decision making and different \nstakeholders (Hosmer and Kiewitz, 2005). Hosmer and Kiewitz point out this void, and \ncall for research in organizational justice to be applied to all stakeholders, rather than just \nto the current employees of the firm. They link business ethics and organizational justice \nby arguing that objective fairness determinants (from the side of the manager) can be \nrelated to subjective fairness perceptions and consequently to reactions. \u201cIn short, the \nauthors propose a normative stakeholder theory of the firm, based upon ethical principles, \nthat will have testable descriptive hypotheses derived from the behavioural constructs\u201d \n(p. 67). Taking this proposition further, justice researchers may engage in action research \nwhere they develop objective fairness criteria together with practicing managers, in order \nto solve business problems in a way that is conforming to objective fairness determinants \nand is perceived to be fair by all involved. In general, justice research concerned with \ndynamics in this first dimension may investigate in how far moral judgments are involved \nin responding activities, and which moral frameworks are used by the different \nstakeholders judging these activities. \n \n \nSecond dimension \n \nThe second group of mechanisms will be termed \u2018preventing\u2019 and corresponds to Lukes\u2019 \nsecond dimension of power exercise. This second dimension argues that power is not \nonly exercised in pluralist open discourse, but that it can be exercised in more subtle \nforms; for example, through agenda setting or preventing groups from raising issues \n(Bachrach and Baratz, 1963). Options and alternatives that reflect the needs of non-\nparticipants might be suppressed. If issues are prevented from arising, then actors are \nprevented from acting. In terms of justice mechanisms in organizations, power \ndifferentials may prevent individuals from reacting negatively to outcomes, procedures, \nand treatment they perceive as unfair. For example, employees may fear negative \n 14\nreactions from their supervisor or negative consequences for their career if they are seen \nto be voicing concerns of injustice. Less powerful members in an organization may have \nno impact on the agenda, and may not be able or willing to raise their concerns about \nfairness.  In fact, employees may not even know how or with whom they could voice \ntheir concerns. All this is particularly relevant as fairness judgments are fundamentally \ninfluenced by social information about or received from relevant comparison others.  \nIn this view, not only the issues that are talked about and decided on are an \nimportant aspect for justice research, but also those which issues are not talked about. \nThe predominant beliefs, values and rules of the games benefit only some. There are \nsome directly observable power mechanisms, like force, sanctions, and manipulation, \nwhile other mechanisms are not directly observable, such as preventing others from \nacting through anticipated reactions, or through sums of incremental decisions. Thus, \nsome of the mechanisms of preventing may be detected in questionnaires, while others \nwould most likely go unnoticed.  \nThis second type of mechanisms also has important implications for practitioners. \nIf outcomes, procedures, and treatment do not correspond to the fairness criteria typically \nidentified in traditional justice research, but the power mechanisms of \u2018preventing\u2019 are in \nplace, then although employees are likely to perceive the treatment as unfair, they will \nnot exhibit (m)any of the negative attitudinal or behavioral reactions the justice literature \nwould suggest. Some covert negative attitudes may still result from the negative justice \nperceptions, but strong pressures, fears or norms may prevent these from ever being \nvoiced or leading to negative behaviors in individuals, and may thus not be \ncommunicated to others. Social \u2018injustice contagion\u2019 is thus less likely to happen as an \noutcome of more subtle exercise of organizational and managerial power and control. \nIn our redundancy example, the survivors may experience unfairness, and the laid \noff people may also feel very unfairly treated, but for different reasons they may not \nexhibit negative behaviours. Various processes can conceivably prevent the survivors \nfrom behavioral responses to the perceived injustice, and could also prevent redundant \nemployees from filing a wrongful termination claim.  They may also fear that filing a \nclaim could give them a negative reputation and make future employment less likely. If \nin the run-up to their actual termination their concerns about the unfairness of the \n 15\nredundancies have not been discussed with their colleagues, the option of filing wrongful \ntermination claims or other reactions to their layoff may not come to their minds, may be \nless likely because of less verbal rehearsal, and relevant knowledge about options and \nprocedures for such reactions (e.g., how to file such a claim) may not have been \ndistributed as widely. Similarly, survivors may be afraid of reprimands or even of losing \ntheir job if they are retaliating. Many tactics can conceivable be used in such \u2018preventing\u2019 \nattempts, such as tabooization of discussions about layoffs, social isolation of the targeted \nemployees, rumour and innuendo about their performance (to provide simple, ready made \ninterpretations about why they have been let go), and many others. \nThe possibility of power differentials preventing individuals from reacting to \nunfair treatment has been mentioned on the sideline of early justice literature. \nCropanzano and Rupp noticed that: \u201cindividuals often endure injustice because other \noptions are closed to them\u201d (2002, p. 257), and also pointed out that a lack of power and \na lack of skill prevent action. Leventhal and his colleagues touch on the role of power \ndistributions for agenda setting when they observe that although procedures are generally \nless salient than distributions, the awareness of procedures will be heightened if \ninfluential members are dissatisfied with distributions (Leventhal et al., 1980). Thus, \nprocedural fairness concerns are added to the agenda and discussed only if changing them \nwould benefit powerful members. Interesting in this context are also findings indicating \nthat injustice along a number of dimensions is necessary for negative behavioral reactions \nto occur, as opposed to attitudinal reactions only. Cropanzano and colleagues \n(Cropanzano et al., 2001) present findings proposing that already either procedural or \ninteractional justice may be sufficient to reduce retaliatory behaviors resulting from \nperceived distributive injustice, while both need be present to mitigate the effects on \nattitudes \u2013 people appear to be more reluctant to express their feelings of injustice \nbehaviorally, which may point towards internalized preventing mechanisms.  \nTwo issues are worth considering from a normative viewpoint: firstly, as in the \ncontext of responding, in the preventing context employees and managers may make \ndifferent justice judgments. Which of these two justice judgments is more appropriate \nwith reference to a particular normative framework is left open for now. Of course, any \nof the groups may make an uninformed and self-serving judgment.  \n 16\nSecondly, there is a moral implication of the mechanism of preventing itself, \nwhich could be seen as either fair or unfair. Is it just to prevent people from reacting to \nperceived unfairness? Again it may depend on the framework employed. Drawing for \nexample on the justice framework developed by Finnis, for whom the objective of justice \nis \u201cthe flourishing of all members of the community\u201d (Finnis, 1980, p. 174), we could \nimagine different scenarios:  Imagine the company would go bankrupt without the \nredundancies, and the job loss for 10% means that 90% can remain in employment. If in \nthis situation a number of employees intend to retaliate in a way that would severely \nharm the company, the overriding consideration of \u2018practical reasonableness\u2019 may require \nprudent management to prevent these employees from acting. However, a different \nsituation where employees have justified concerns and are prevented from voicing them \nthrough unproportional measures is also imaginable \u2013 and in this case the preventing \nmechanisms cannot be said to be fair. The treatment of the employees who are made \nredundant (beyond their statutory rights) may be seen as a commutative justice issue. For \ncommutative justice, the question is to be asked \u201cof what is fitting, fair, or just as \nbetween the parties to the relationship\u201d (Finnis, 1980, p. 178). \nOrganisational justice research does not consider either the normative base of the \nperceptions of the different stakeholders, nor the righteousness or even existence of \npreventing mechanisms. In this second category of \u2018preventing\u2019, people are cooperating, \nalthough they perceive unfairness. (This is not to say whether these individual judgments \nof unfairness actually comply with a particular ethical framework). An in-depth \ndiscussion of the different issues involved, both in the differing judgments between \nemployees and management and other stakeholders (as discussed above in the section on \nresponding), could be complemented by investigations of and reflections on the power \nmechanisms that are likely to modify people\u2019s reactions to any perceived fairness or \nunfairness. This work may lead to a fruitful cross-fertilization between the fields of \nbusiness ethics and organizational justice.  \nAcknowledging the existence of the mechanism of \u2018preventing\u2019 next to the \nmechanism of \u2018responding\u2019 poses significant challenges for both the agenda and the \napproaches used in organizational justice research. Qualitative data is needed in order to \nunveil not only which decisions are made, but also which decisions are avoided. In order \n 17\nto investigate specific mechanisms of power use in fairness contexts, lab studies could be \ndesigned to show for example under which circumstances the more powerful (i.e., \nmanagement) take which moral considerations into account when dealing with the less \npowerful (i.e., employees) (see e.g., Kipnis, 1972; Overbeck and Park, 2001). \nFurthermore, longitudinal studies appear to be necessary, as agenda control mechanisms \ntypically involve a timeframe that is somewhat longer than the making of a distinct \ndecision. Both attitudinal and behavioral reactions should be considered, as these may \nunderlie different mechanisms. OJ research will need to consider employing research \napproaches that will provide opportunities to reveal the otherwise hidden elements of \n\u2018preventing\u2019 dynamics.  \n \n \nThird dimension \n \nThe third mechanism, \u2018shaping\u2019, involves managerial activities aimed at shaping \nemployees\u2019 understanding of what is fair and the way they conceptualize fairness. This \nparallels Lukes\u2019 third dimension of power mechanisms, according to which one form of \npower is to shape the conception of issues and influencing wants of others. By necessity \nthese mechanisms are much \u2018subtler\u2019 and include the creation of social myths, the use of \nlanguage and symbols, and even non-verbal suggestions. Meaning is socially constructed \nthrough both observable and implicit, indirect mechanisms. The less powerful may be \nmanipulated in terms of not recognizing grievances, in their conception of self and group, \nnot realizing who is responsible, not seeing possible alternatives, and not knowing \neffective strategies for clarifying their own thinking and for taking action.  \nWith respect to fairness perceptions, this implies that employees\u2019 understanding \nand perceptions of justice might be shaped in such a way as to make them perceive the \ntreatment they receive as fair, even if this treatment does not correspond to the fairness \ncriteria identified typically in other settings, to fairness criteria that independent outsiders \nwould have, or to the criteria posited by a particular normative system. For example, \nsocialization mechanisms might result in the adoption of values and fairness expectations \n 18\nthat align with managerial mindframes. Leventhal, et al., (1980) noted that many \nmembers do not understand complex social systems and that procedures (once \nestablished) are often not even recognized. For example, employees may learn that it is \nthe norm that management makes decisions without asking employees for their opinions, \nor that overtime is not paid for. Usually the mechanisms of shaping are expected to span \nlonger time frames than the more straight forward mechanisms of responding. In \naddition, these mechanisms may be of an even more subtle nature than the preventing \nmechanism discussed above.  \nManagers can influence justice perceptions and resulting reactions of employees \nthrough shaping. The avenue of shaping mechanisms results in a much larger scope of \naction for companies, who could, for example, establish fairness rules that benefit \nproductivity and are cost saving, while still preserving their positive image as a fair \nemployer. A critical reading of modern HRM strategies and procedures could easily lead \nto such conclusions. Positive fairness perceptions are likely to result in the same positive \nattitudinal and behavioral responses that we would expect in the case where the \norganization fulfils the original fairness requirements perceived by an independent \noutsider. From a purely economic perspective, this may look like an appealing option to \norganizations. \nOne of the mechanisms could for example be to promote the choice of certain \nallocation norms, and a company might be interested in paying according to the equity \nprinciple rather than according to equality, in order to increase productivity (in fact, this \nis the predominant distribution rule in most companies, although some public sector \nand\/or heavily unionized organizations are exceptions to this). The preferences of \nallocation norms differ between cultures (Greenberg, 2001), and organizational culture is \nlikely to have a significant influence on which norms are considered appropriate in any \nspecific organizational setting (e.g., equality, equity, need). \nAnother shaping mechanism is mentioned by Kulik (1992). Managers can \nimprove the justice perceptions of individuals through influencing their choice of \nreferents. By proposing comparison others that make the employees\u2019 situation look \nadvantageous, employees might perceive a higher degree of fairness. A manager might \ntry to invoke specific favorable comparisons (\u2018we are all getting so much more than three \n 19\nyears ago\u2019), while fending off unfavorable comparisons (e.g., \u2018you cannot compare \nyourselves to employees at competitor Y that are paid and treated better because their \nsituation is too different from ours\u2019).  \nIn our redundancy example, employees may have come to learn that redundancies \nare \u2018normal\u2019 practice, even when the company is recording record profits. Lower level \nemployees may feel that it is not their place to be involved in this kind of decisions, and \nthat management can of course not share sensitive information with them. They may \nbelieve that everything that happens is for the greater good for the company and thus \nultimately for themselves, even if there is the risk that they are the ones that will be let \ngo. Even when receiving undeserved negative outcomes that have been determined \nthrough biased procedures and not being given any information, they may not perceive \nthis as an injustice. Or, alternatively, employees may have come to realize that the \norganization is under very serious pressure, and that there is really no other way to avoid \nbankruptcy than to lay some employees off, and that the outmost has been done to \ncompensate these employees. This example underlines that shaping may be used in very \ndifferent ways and circumstances. \nThis third category proposes that it is possible to evoke perceptions of fairness, \nwithout actually having to comply with generally accepted or shared standards of \nfairness, even those that employees might originally have had when they joined the \norganization. This option has not been discussed in research on organizational justice. \nStudies have concentrated on perceptions of fairness and attitudinal outcomes \u2013 \napparently taking normative frameworks as a given across organizational settings, and \nassuming that the way positive fairness perceptions were created was not ambiguous or \nambivalent.  \nFrom a normative ethical perspective, different issues are involved here than in \nthe previous categories of responding and preventing: Now both managers and \nemployees subscribe to the same fairness norms, but it is not clear whether these norms \nare actually more or less aligned with any particular normative fairness standard that \nemployees may have had before they joined the organisation. It is possible that managers \nopen the eyes of employees to recognize valid issues and to understand the context of \ncorporate decisions better, in order to then make a more appropriate assessment of \n 20\nfairness than before. However, it has been noted that managerial morality is often purely \ngeared towards preserving institutional power, and that power holders may believe \nthemselves \u2018exempt from common morality\u2019 (Kipnis, 1972, p. 34). Thus, it is also \npossible that managers themselves subscribe to a purely instrumental normative \nframework, with little reference to morality, and that they pass this framework on to \nemployees. \n Acknowledging framing effects stresses the responsibility that rests with \nmanagers as potential norm setters. Recent claims that the moral reasoning skills and \nmoral development of business students may actually decrease rather than improve (see \ne.g., Pfeffer and Fong, 2002) is no good news in this context. At the same time, it is \nimportant to recognize that managers are not as privileged and powerful in setting norms \nas they are in determining rules and procedures. Informal and intangible aspects of \norganizations such as culture and norms are determined by many factors, not just \nmanagers. OJ research has so far implicitly assumed that it is factors common across \norganizational settings (such as national culture) that influences such norms and \ninterpretation frames, but other sources of influence may be at work (including bottom-up \ninfluences controlled or affected by employees).  \nThe second issue to consider here from a normative standpoint is whether it is \nright to influence \u2013 some might say manipulate \u2013 employees in this way. Here, the \nintervention is not taking place in terms of preventing an action (as in the preventing \nmechanism), but is taking place earlier, in people\u2019s minds. To draw on Finnis\u2019 framework \non justice again, one needs to take the overall good of all involved into account. Shaping \nmechanisms can result in employees perceiving the situation as fair, and this perception \nmay have positive outcomes for the organization and in some cases even for the \nemployee (e.g., less stress and more job satisfaction). However, the gap between actual \n(normative) justice and perceived justice can be widened through shaping mechanisms. \nThis gap could bring about a number of potential problems for the organization. \nAttracting new staff, for example, may be difficult for an organization that has moved far \naway from conventional fairness norms, and clients may be alienated. Also, the gap may \nultimately work to the disadvantage of the conforming employees themselves, who may \naccept normatively unfair treatments or outcomes following shaping mechanisms. \n 21\nHowever, in some cases shaping may take a purely benevolent form, such as providing a \nvalid perspective and improved understanding of the situation.  \nTaking the shaping category of fairness formation into account would require \nmore critical investigations into how fairness perceptions are actually created, and what \nrole short and long-term processes instigated by managers have on employees\u2019 fairness \njudgments. Assessing divergent judgments compared to similar respondents not exposed \nto such shaping attempts (e.g., comparable employees from other organizations), or \nlongitudinal investigations into fairness judgment changes over time could provide useful \ninsights into this matter.  \nThe investigation of mechanisms implied by preventing and shaping mechanisms \nof justice would require the field of organizational justice to depart from its typical \nresearch paradigms. Cropanzano, et al., (2001) categorize existing fairness research into \ntwo paradigms: The \u2018event paradigm\u2019 investigates individual reactions to a certain \nfairness-related event, mainly through experimental research. The other paradigm, \nentitled \u2018social entity paradigm\u2019, typically investigates the reactions of groups, people \nand organizations in different fairness situations through field studies, using correlational \nstatistical analysis. There are very few studies investigating reactions to fairness \nlongitudinally (Ambrose and Cropanzano, 2003). Yet in order to include pre-empting and \nshaping mechanisms in future investigations, researchers need to explore issues such as \nthe creation of fairness perceptions and reactions over time. The development of \norganizational justice and the underlying perceptual processes over time have rarely been \nthe main focus of efforts in empirical research (although some theoretical contributions \nhave been made), with notably the exception of some contributions in cognitive \npsychology, which explored individual level perceptions more closely (e.g., Lind, 2001). \nThe lack of longitudinal studies poses severe limitations, as for example changes in \ninternal fairness norms or of external referent standards cannot be captured (Cropanzano \nand Greenberg, 1997) and no conclusions can be drawn about causality in cross-sectional, \nsingle-source designs. Further, qualitative investigations are needed in order to tackle \nsome of the resulting research questions that have not been asked so far (e.g., uncovering \nthe way in which power can influence internal justice norms and shared justice \nideologies). \n 22\nOne step towards the inclusion of the non-traditional mechanisms of fairness \ncreation may be the involvement of additional disciplinary perspectives (e.g., sociology, \nethics) and deliberately employing different, possibly multiple methodological \napproaches. The disciplinary background of organizational justice researchers is likely to \nhave contributed to the focus on quantitative and quasi-experimental methods to the \nexclusion of qualitative and emic research.  \nNew justice theories may be developed in order to deal with the mechanisms \nimplied by preventing and shaping processes. Up to now, theories trying to explain how \nfairness perceptions are formed have mostly taken a social psychology or cognitive \npsychology approach and have implicitly been limited to large degrees of organizational \nstability or short time frames. The theories developed have granted valuable insights into \nthe psychology and cognitions involved in making fairness judgments, and these \u2018process \ntheories\u2019 have explained different potential routes along which individuals make fairness \njudgments. On the one side of the continuum, careful evaluation of all information leads \nto deliberate fairness judgments, while on the other side a quick judgment relying on \ninformation that is readily available is labeled automatic processing (Cropanzano et al., \n2001),  \nHow fairness judgments are formed in larger social contexts and over larger time \nspans or in times of significant organizational change is not being addressed by these \ntheories. The strong individual-level focus of process theories in organizational justice \nhas also pronounced the gap between what has been termed proactive research (how \ndecision makers take fairness criteria into account) and reactive research (how the \nreceivers of decisions or treatment make fairness judgments and react). Greenberg and \nWiethoff\u2019s work provides an example to bridge this gap, albeit at an individual level of \nanalysis (Greenberg and Wiethoff, 2001). Decision maker and receiver differ mainly with \nrespect to their power positions, yet their perceptions, attitudes and behavior are likely to \nbe closely intertwined in social contexts. Not only are the powerless bound by the \npowerful, but the powerful are also bound by the powerless in terms of the obligations \nassociated with their role (Hamilton and Biggart, 1985). The perceivers\u2019 (i.e., \nemployees\u2019) justice perceptions and judgments may also shape the justice related \n 23\nframework that an employer will use. At present, typical OJ research designs and tools do \nnot appropriately account for such interactions. \nWatson presents a rare contribution that focuses on the shaping aspect of fairness \ncreation (Watson, 2003) and points out that \u201c[r]esearch on perceptions of fairness is \ncomplicated by the ways in which powerful alliances (e.g., change agents) control and \ndisseminate ideas, norms and values \u2013 ideology \u2013 that encourage others to understand and \ninterpret changes through management\u2019s preferred cognitive frame of reference.\u201d (p. \n155). Watson investigates ways in which ideological discourse constructs perceptions of \nfairness, legitimacy and defensibility in change situations. His analysis suggests that \nleaders use numerous strategies to shape employees\u2019 perceptions of fairness in the best of \nmanagerial interests. However, while his concise analysis of managerial discourse in \nchange situations provides insights into the techniques that management uses, it cannot \nanswer the degree of the influence the ideology has on employees, the degree to which \nfairness perceptions are shaped by the discourse intended to do so, and the degree to \nwhich the ideological discourse of leaders results in cooperation by employees.  \nWatson\u2019s study of managerial discourse is a first step towards our understanding \nof shaping mechanisms, but in order to achieve a fuller picture, we need to investigate the \ndiscourse of both people whose perceptions are shaped and the discourse that is intended \nto shape perceptions. Particularly promising in this context are insights that studies \ncombining qualitative and longitudinal data could grant. Repeated measures and designs \nof fairness perceptions and outcomes alone are not sufficient, as they cannot distinguish \nthe mechanisms of the first category, \u201cresponding\u201d, from the mechanism of the third \ncategory, \u2018shaping\u2019.2  \nThe category of \u2018shaping\u2019 is made invisible in purely subjectivist definitions of \norganizational justice. Employees, who have been \u2018shaped\u2019 to agree with managerial \nnorms of justice will exhibit positive fairness judgments. The purely subjectivist \ndefinition of justice clearly has limitations and cannot differentiate between very different \nsettings: fairness perceptions achieved through shaping and fairness perceptions achieved \nthrough responding. Again, future researchers may wish to draw on ethical and \nsociological perspectives to fill this void. When drawing on normative perspectives, then \ndifferences between pre-shaping and post-shaping frameworks become clear. The justice \n 24\njudgment standards used may conform more or less to a particular normative framework \nafter the shaping process took place. What may be required is not simply the scientific \nstudy of justice which \u201cprovides a non-ideological tool for studying the malevolent as \nwell as the benevolent aspects of fair treatment\u201d (MacCoun, 2005, p. 193), but possible \nvalue-sensitive, multi-perspective approaches that contrast the implications of \nmanagerialist and alternative ideologies. A value-driven debate may add value and \ninsight to supposedly value-free scientific investigations.  \n \n \nInterrelation of the different justice mechanisms \n \nThe three types of mechanisms have been outlined separately above for reasons of clarity. \nHowever, in organizational reality they are likely to be closely intertwined. Gaventa \n(1980) describes how both power and powerlessness are relatively accumulative, e.g., \nwhen people suffer many defeats (1st dimension) they may cease to challenge and as an \nadaptive response to the continual defeat first withdraw (2nd dimension) or lower their \ndemands and finally internalize the values of the powerful (3rd dimension). \nIn terms of justice and fairness mechanisms, employees may initially try and \nresist treatment that they perceive to be unfair. The employer could counter this either by \nresponding to the employees\u2019 views of unfairness by fulfilling employees\u2019 expectations, \nor they might alternatively prevent employees from exhibiting negative reactions and \nfrom voicing their concerns (preventing). While the preventing mechanisms on the side \nof the organization are preventing only behaviors in the short term, they are likely to \nchange mindframes in the longer run, and employees may come to simply accept the new \nreality (shaping). In effect, this could result in expectations that are fully in line with the \ntreatment and outcomes that are in management\u2019s interest, thus \u2018responding\u2019 may become \na very viable option for the organization. With the \u2018organizationally shaped\u2019 employees, \nresponding is likely to be less costly and aligned with managerial interests. In short, \ntoday\u2019s shaping experiences are likely to determine tomorrow\u2019s responding patterns.  \n 25\nTime is an important factor to consider when comparing the mechanisms. While \nresponding mechanisms may happen in the spur of a moment, through a simple \nmanagerial decision (e.g. giving a pay rise, providing information, etc.), the other \nmechanisms are likely to span larger timeframes. Preventing employees from acting on \nthe negative and retaliatory feelings that have been shown to result from perceptions of \ninjustice, will need careful monitoring, controlling and design of that need to be \nintegrated in the organization\u2019s processes and structures. Shaping in turn requires \nmechanisms of socialization and of providing people with work experiences and new \nviews of thinking. The difficulty and time requirements of this process are likely to \ndepend in part on individual differences, but also on the alignment of the propagated \nviews with society\u2019s norms. Figure 1 provides an overview of the interrelations between, \nand typical timeframes of, the different mechanisms. \n \n \nINSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE \n \nThe radical views on justice and fairness presented above point out the lack of \nreflexivity employed by OJ researchers, and the way in which organizational practitioners \nmay employ justice research purely as a managerialist tool. We argue that such a lack of \nreflexivity may lead to hypocrisies for both research and practice.  \n \n \nThe hypocrisies of organizational justice research and practice \n \nThe subjective definition used in organizational justice research is a perceptual one and \ncould give rise to a hypocrisy of justice, where justice research does not recognize or \naddress its moral responsibilities.  \nSecondly, the managerialist ethos of justice research has offered accessible tools \nto managers, which may enable them to benefit from positive behaviors resulting from \nemployees\u2019 fairness perceptions, while avoiding the costs of actually considering ethical \n 26\nor normative fairness. We describe this effect as the hypocrisy of organizational justice in \npractice.  \n \nOJ research and the \u2018Hypocrisy of Justice\u2019 \n \nAs discussed in the beginning of this paper, the ideological underpinning adopted by the \nOJ field is pro-management rather than employee-centered (Bies and Tripp, 2002). This \norientation transpires for example in the choice of outcomes and situations investigated. \nEven though there may be a significant overlap in the situations, outcomes and \nantecedents of justice that are of interest to different stakeholders, there are no reasons to \nbelieve that managers and employees will have identical interests. On the contrary, \nevidence proposes that they have often very divergent interests. Unlike managers \nrepresenting their organizations, employees may not profit directly from increased \ncommitment or work effort, a situation that may well be reversed regarding the benefits \nof for example decreased anxiety. The questions opened up through considering \npreventing and shaping mechanisms, namely issues of status and power, are likely to be \nas relevant for employees as they are for managers, but are likely to be experienced \nfundamentally different from an employee perspective. As outlined above, the gap \nbetween normative fairness and perceived fairness can also create numerous problems for \nemployers in the longer term. Future research might also consider the role of \norganizational justice for other stakeholders, and in society overall (as proposed by \nHosmer and Kiewitz, 2005). Ethical considerations and related issues of social justice and \npower distributions have so far not featured in mainstream OJ research. Similarly, \nalternative justice norms and referents, comparisons to other cultures and other times in \nhistory have rarely featured.  \nBies and Tripp accuse justice researchers of not assuming the moral responsibility \nto ask whether organizational justice findings may in fact be used to perpetuate injustice \nin the workplace (Bies and Tripp, 1995; Bies and Tripp, 2001). OJ researchers appear to \ncontent themselves largely by assuming that their findings will serve for the better, \nwithout demonstrating or testing this assumption. Paterson, Green and Cary claim that \norganizational justice findings will \u201chelp maintain employee and organizational well-\n 27\nbeing.\u201d (Paterson et al., 2002, p. 406), while Greenberg assumes that better training of \nmanagers in applying organizational justice frameworks will achieve increased moral \nfairness (Greenberg, 2001). There is little evidence to support such claims, and hardly \nany research into the effects that OJ research findings have on organizational and \nmanagerial practice. Does justice research help to promote values and change? Simply \ncommunicating fairness research findings to managers may not actually lead to increased \nfairness for employees. In the worst case, the dissemination of OJ frameworks and \nfindings may unwittingly create just the opposite effect.  \nFuture research in organizational justice that considers and reflects on its role and \nimpact in society would undoubtedly enrich the field. It remains to be seen whether \nfindings from OJ research are used for window dressing and impression management \npurposes, or whether they will benefit all stakeholders involved. Justice researchers could \ntry to take an active role in promoting their findings to be used for the maximum societal \nbenefit. \nThe normative dimension of justice requires further reflection. The subjective \nconception of justice has obvious value, but the limitations this restricted approach has on \nthe field need to be addressed. Similarly, the role of values in OJ research deserves \nsubstantial consideration. Ignoring the implications of adopting this purely subjective \nview may cloud recognition of non-intended results of OJ research in practice. Thus, OJ \nresearchers may commit the fallacy of expecting their research to contribute to improved \njustice in organizations while in fact enabling the exploitation of employees under the \nguise of this venerated objective. A lack of reflexivity by OJ researchers can thus enable \nthe hypocrisy of fairness of practitioners, as described below.  \n \n \nHypocrisy of organizational justice in practice \n \nManagers are socialized, trained, and rewarded to act in accordance with organizational \ngoals, and in their pursuit of these goals may adopt a distinctly uncritical, pro-\norganizational frame of mind which we have referred to above as a managerialist \napproach. Within a managerialist mindset, fairness considerations and organizational \n 28\njustice frameworks are simply tools for influencing and controlling employee behavior in \norganizationally desired ways. Thus, from a managerialist perspective the motive to be \nfair takes on a purely instrumental character rather than serving as a normative value (see \nGreenberg and Cohen, 1982). As long as managers are trained and rewarded for \neffectiveness, not moral rectitude, they will be most concerned with the utility of \nfairness-oriented behaviors rather than their righteousness. \nHowever, for some managers OJ research may provide the business rationale that \nthey feel they need in order to bring forward their moral concerns (Bird and Waters, \n1989). Similarly, for OJ researchers that deliberately or inadvertently adopt the \nmanagerialist ethos, the objective is to provide insights valuable for furthering managerial \ncontrol in pursuit of organizational goals. Such concerns, along with an emphasis on \nscientific respectability, counter the potential concerns about the researchers\u2019 (and the \nresearch\u2019s) ethical accountability (Fernandez-Dols, 2002).  \nIn current OJ research it appears to be sufficient for managers to look fair rather \nthan attempt to actually be fair from a normative vantage point. This does not preclude \nthat managers can use OJ frameworks and research findings benignly, by responding to \nemployees\u2019 expectations regarding fairness in the workplace, or even more constructively \nby engaging employees in such a dialogue. However, OJ frameworks and research \nfindings can be, and we believe often are, used exploitatively. For example, OJ research \nfindings may simply provide guidance for managerial impression management. In \nparticular, OJ contributions that provide insights into how employees make their fairness \njudgments may be useful for managers by helping to avoid any substantial \u2013 and possibly \ncostly \u2013 changes to the objects of employees\u2019 unfairness perceptions, and instead \nfacilitate a manipulation of perceptions and mindframes.  \nWe contend that managerial training and socialization may make managers \nparticularly susceptible to the managerialist ethos, which is continuously reinforced \nthrough appropriate organizational reward systems. Managers have often been described \nas reward-driven and self-interested (Friedman, 1962). This tendency is further reinforced \nby the type of input managers receive from OJ researchers. Specifically, if fairness is \nframed purely as a subjective notion, moral and ethical issues related to justice may not \neven be considered. \n 29\nManagers may feel that they are serving the higher ideals of justice simply by \nrestoring perceptions of fairness through any of the strategies and means discussed above. \nManagers who act like this abdicate the moral responsibility some would argue they have \nbecause of their privileged, more powerful position in organizations. This is where a lack \nof reflexivity on the part of managers can contribute to the hypocrisy of fairness. \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn this paper we have identified three types of mechanisms managers may use to \ninfluence and manage the formation of fairness perceptions. This taxonomy integrates the \ndimensions of power mechanisms, and spans individual- and social-level dynamics. We \nproposed that the investigation of the different dimensions promises additional insight \nand theoretical underpinning in processes underlying fairness judgments, and can add \nsignificantly to the development of OJ theory and research. Our approach makes power \ndynamics and moral implications salient, and questions the purely subjectivist view of \njustice researchers that deliberately discards normative aspects.  \nThe questions opened up by considering alternative mechanisms for creating \nfairness perceptions are also of interest for research taking a more critical perspective. \nJustice judgments alone do not enable the direct comparison of two different settings. \nOnly in combination with understanding the underlying mechanisms that have created \njustice perceptions in different settings can we really get a clear sense if and how \nemployees\u2019 as well as other stakeholders\u2019 interests can be served.  \nEmpirical research will be necessary to validate and further refine the \npropositions presented above. Particularly, qualitative and longitudinal research is needed \nto complement extant organizational justice research. Given the central role of social \ninteraction and power mechanisms in the workplace, the new avenues of research \nresulting from radical perspectives on OJ have the potential to open up research on OJ to \nnew conceptions, new research questions, and the use of more varied methodologies. It \nwould also aid more considered prescriptions along with substantial challenges regarding \n 30\nthe moral and ethical aspects of applying such prescriptions. Different normative \nconceptions of justice can and should be compared to subjective judgments of justice in \ncontext.  \nRecognizing the danger for OJ research brought about by a narrow and \nunreflected conception of justice, and by a managerialist bias in formulating its research \nquestions, is an important first step in addressing the shortcomings of the field, as \nidentified in this paper. We believe that increased reflexivity can be a useful response by \nresearchers to the danger of committing the hypocrisy of organizational justice in \nresearch. Similarly, increased reflexivity by managers, including a look at their internal \nmoral compass, can prevent them from committing the hypocrisy of organizational \njustice in practice.  \nBoth practitioners and researchers need to take responsibility for their own part in \nbringing about fairness and justice in organizations. We believe that this can be further \nhelped by joint considerations of how the link between research and practice can improve \nthe reality of justice in the workplace, and by reference to normative and ethical \nconceptions of justice.  \nFinally, we propose that an integration of the fields of organizational justice and \nnormative justice can also bring benefits to ethical and moral theory. Organizational \njustice encourages thought about organizational level phenomena (rather than societal \nlevel), and in particular to consider the viewpoints of central participants in the process. \nMoreover, our exposition above points to the exciting opportunity to combine subjectivist \nand normative conceptions of justice in more comprehensive investigations of justice in \norganizational settings. Utilitarian and deontic perspectives have largely ignored the \ndetails of context and process, which appear to be so important to participants. We \nbelieve that the fields of organizational justice and normative justice can benefit from \nresearch that explicitly takes them both into account.  \n \n \nNotes: \n 31\n1 A previous version of this paper was originally presented at the IESE Business School, \nUniversity of Navarra, for the 14th International Symposium on Ethics, Business and \nSociety: \u201cTowards a Comprehensive Integration of Ethics Into Management: Problems \nand Prospects\u201d.
