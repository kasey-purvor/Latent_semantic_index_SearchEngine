While this \napproach is adequate for services operating at high-latitudes \nduring quiet ionospheric conditions it is insufficient to deal \nwith a disturbed ionosphere.  This paper presents the results \nof empirical modelling of the changes that occur in the D- and \nE-regions of the ionosphere following the onset of disturbed \nconditions as defined by the occurrence of a storm sudden \ncommencement. \n \n1 Introduction \nThe use of HF communications at high latitudes still forms \nthe back bone of many communications systems.  At high \nlatitudes there are few alternatives to HF radio for the \nmerchant and fishing fleets, military forces (land, sea and air) \nand for the civil aviation industry.  The typical features of HF \nradio communications following magnetic disturbances \ninclude: the incidence of large absorption spikes, changes in \npropagation modes, reductions in operational frequencies as \nelectron density in the F-region changes and a growth in \nauroral absorption.  Ionospheric propagation during magnetic \ndisturbances at these latitudes has been an enigma, in part \nbecause ionograms do not always provide analysable data due \nto absorption, blanketing and spread-F effects.   \n \nNumerous studies of the high-latitude ionosphere have been \nundertaken to aid in understanding the response of the HF \ncommunication channel to space weather effects.  A review of \nboth effects and the associated problems, with many \nreferences, is provided in [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5].  More recently \nthe impact of 14 geomagnetic storms, which occurred during \n1997-1999, on radio propagation conditions, was examined \n[6].   \n \n1.1 HF Propagation Prediction. \nThe validity of using HF propagation prediction programs has \nbeen addressed [7] and good agreement between the \nprediction and measurements made during quiet conditions \nhas been found.  It has also been noted the aggregate correct \nprediction of these programs was only ~ 45% under disturbed \nconditions [5]. \n \nThe use of propagation prediction programs to establish, in \nadvance, the choice of operating frequency is still the basis of \noperations of many communication systems. For example HF \nbroadcasting requires frequencies and schedules to be agreed \nmonths in advance of actual usage and military exercises at \nhigh-latitudes are preceded by detailed advance planning and \nthe distribution of set tables of frequencies well in advance.  It \nappears that this methodology of advance planning and the \nrange of hourly median parameters produced by the \npropagation prediction programs is adequate for operational \npurposes, during quiet conditions.  The problem to be \novercome is to determine what propagation parameters need \nto be modified during disturbed conditions, that is, what \nconsequential modifications need to be made to the \ncommunications system parameters to ensure some form of \ncontinued operation during disturbed conditions.   \n \nFrom an operational point of view a technique is needed to \naddress the uncertainties generated by ionospheric \ndisturbances on key ionospheric parameters and a number of \nauthors have examined this problem (e.g. [8, 9, 10 and 11]).  \nA number of authors have also proposed the use of oblique \nand vertical sounding data to provide near real-time \nionospheric maps and communication performance \nparameters; e.g. [12 and 13].  Certainly while each of these \napproaches has different applications and merits, the authors \nhave chosen another approach. \n \nThe authors\u201f approach is that advocated by Lundborg et al \n[14] \u2013 \u201cIt seems that priority should be given to the \ndevelopment of propagation prediction\n1\n methods which \npredict the deviation from the median rather than the \nmedian\u201d.   \n \nWhat is missing is the defining point at which the deviation \nfrom the median starts.  The authors have used the storm \nsudden commencement (SSC) as this defining point.    \n1.2 Storm Sudden Commencement. \nCoronal mass ejections from the Sun give raise to shock \nwaves in the solar wind. The related pressure pulses, when \nimpinging on the earth's magnetosphere, both compress it and \nincrease the magnetopause current. This leads into a few tens \nof nano-Tesla (nT) change in the low-latitude ground-based \nmagnetic field intensity, lasting typically for some tens of \nminutes. These signatures are called Storm Sudden \nCommencements (SSC) and announce the onset of \ngeomagnetic storm and subsequently identify the start of a \nperiod of change in composition of the ionosphere, such as \nreconfiguration of the magnetosphere, injection of particles \ninto the radiation belts, changes of particle drift velocities, \nsudden onsets of wave activities etc.   \n \nThe advantages of using SSC events as the point of origin is \ntwo fold.  Firstly, the occurrence and timing of an SSC is \ninternationally agreed [15] and therefore a very useful \nreference point when comparing results from a number of \ndifferent instruments in different locations.  Secondly, the \nSSC identifies the start of the change of composition of the \nionosphere with associated energetic particle precipitation \u2013 \nthat is the transition point between a \u201equiet\u201f and a \u201edisturbed\u201f \nionosphere.   \n \n2 Modelling Changes in the D-region \nThe first manifestation, coincident with the SSC is a large \nabsorption spike, known as sudden commencement \nabsorption (SCA), lasting tens of minutes that disrupts low to \nmid HF frequency operations.  The cause of this affect is the \nsudden increase of electron density in the D-layer due to \ndeeply penetrating charged particles [16]. \n \nIn a recent paper [17] the authors set out to find the best \npredictor of SCA based on solar wind parameters.  The \nauthors examined the characteristics of SCA across more than \nhalf a solar cycle, from the sunspot maximum in 2000 to the \nnear sunspot minimum in 2006.  Having discounted \nambiguous events, 175 SSC events and the co-incident SCA \nwere investigated. \n2.1 Data. \nFor each of the 175 events data from the IRIS Riometer at \nKilpisj\u00e4rvi (69.10N, 20.80E, L=6.06) was used to measure the \npeak absorption resulting from particle precipitation caused \n                                                          \n1\n The italic text has been inserted by the authors to clarify the context of the \nquote \nby SSC shocks.   In essence a riometer observes temporal \nvariations in ionisation in the D and E regions caused by \ncharged particle precipitation [18].  An example of such an \nabsorption signature following a SSC event at 14:10 UT on 3 \nApril 2004, is shown in figure 1.   \n \n \n \nFigure 1:  Riometer measurement from the central beam of \nthe IRIS riometer - 1 minute resolution sampling.  \nThe SSC occurred at 14:10 UT which is indicated \nby the long-dashed line.  The peak SCA measured \nin this example is indicated by the dotted line. \n \nBefore the SSC the absorption was negligible.  At the start of \nthe SSC the absorption increases within 5 minutes to 0.8 dB, \npeaking at 0.85 dB ten minutes after the SSC event \ncommences.  Fifteen minutes after the peak the absorption \nfalls to less than 0.2 dB with some variability thereafter due to \nsubsequent magnetospheric activity. \n \nSolar wind and IMF Data for this study was sourced from \nmeasurements taken by the ACE spacecraft.  See [19] for \ndetails of the satellite and instrumentation.  For each SSC \nevent the following solar wind parameters were measured \nbefore and after the SSC: \n \n\uf0a7 B \u2013 the IMF field strength (nT) \n\uf0a7 Bz \u2013 the magnitude and direction of the Bz component of \nthe solar wind (nT) \n\uf0a7 Vp - solar wind proton velocity (km.s\n-1\n) \n\uf0a7 Np \u2013 solar wind proton density (cm\n-3\n) \n \n2.2 Results. \nAs the data spans more than half a solar cycle it was possible \nto determine if solar activity influenced the data set.  This was \ndone by evaluating the link between SCA and the change in \nIMF magnitude against solar activity as reflected by the value \nof the relevant monthly sunspot number.  Across a range of \nmonthly sunspot number from 8 to 170 it was concluded that \nthat there is no causal link between SCA and sunspot number \nor between IMF magnitude and SCA, other than in the \nfrequency of occurrence of SSC events.  This last point is not \nunexpected as higher sunspot levels reflect the increase in the \nnumber of active regions on the sun that are the source of \nshocks leading to SSC events. \n \nHaving calculated and compared the median, median and \nstandard deviation of SCA between the day (6-18 MLT) and \nthe night (18-6 MLT) it was shown that  while the occurrence \nof SCA is slightly greater during the day there is no \nsignificant difference in the mean, median or standard \ndeviation values of SCA between night and day.   \n \nFor all events where Bz information was available (152 \nevents) the mean, median and standard deviation of SCA for \nall the possible Bz movements (e.g. north to south, north to \nfurther north, etc) were compared against each other.  The \nsimilarity in statistics between all four types of event \nindicates that the direction of Bz has little impact on the \ntypical values of SCA, for example, more than half of the \nselected SCA events occurred during northward Bz \nmovements, which in some cases continued even more \nstrongly northward after the SSC event.   \n \n2.2 Modelling of SCA  \nHaving determined that there is no causal link between SCA \nand sunspot number, no causal link between IMF magnitude \nand SCA, no significant difference in night time and day time \nSCA and that Bz has little impact on the typical values of \nSCA the best predicator of  SCA was sought.   The method \nused was to find the best predictor of SCA based on one or \nmore solar wind parameters in order to clarify the affect of \nsolar wind and IMF shocks on SCA.  In order to do this a \nsubstantial body of work was undertaken to correlate each of \nthe parameters B, Bz, Vp and Np with the absolute, average \nand median values of SCA measured at the moment of SSC.   \n \nThe best results were achieved when using the median value \nof measured SCA.  The median value is a measure of central \ntendency that provides us with a description of the entire data \nset and is especially useful when data sets contain a few \nextremely high values that can skew the distribution, as is the \ncase here.  The median is less sensitive to extreme values and \nis an appropriate measure when dealing with the highly \nvariable ionosphere and magnetosphere.  It is for similar \nreasons and also convenient that hourly median values are the \nstandard output from HF propagation prediction programmes \nand using median values of SCA allows comparisons to be \nmade against predicted median values of absorption.   \n \nFigure 2 consists of four panels showing the median value of \nSCA compared against the step change in IMF and solar wind \nparameters at the moment of SSC; (\u0394B) (top panel), solar \nwind velocity (\u0394Vp) (second panel) and solar wind particle \ndensity (\u0394Np) (bottom panel).  A first order regression is \napplied to the last scatter plot and a second order regression is \napplied to the first two scatter plots.  The choice of only a first \norder regression for the last plot was determined by the wide \nspread of values in the data.  Figure 2 demonstrates the strong \ncorrelation between solar wind velocity and SCA but also the \neven stronger correlation between the IMF and SCA.   \n \n \n \nFigure 2:  Scatter plot and regression of median SCA vs. \n(from top to bottom) \u0394B, \u0394Vp and \u0394Np  \n \nBy a wide margin, the strongest correlation was found \nbetween the median value of SCA measured and \u0394B, the step \nchange in IMF magnitude that occurred during the shock.  \nThe fitted curve in the top panel of figure 2, with a correlation \ncoefficient (R\n2\n) of 0.852, is a second order equation of the \nform:   \n2\nA 0.32 0.07 B 0.0077 Bm  \n  \nWhere: Am   =  the median value of SCA expected \n  \u0394B =  the change in IMF due to the shock \n      \nThe fit for \u0394B against median SCA is very good at values of \n\u0394B < 25 nT, reducing somewhat at values of \u0394B > 25 nT.  \nWhile this does bear further investigation less than 3% of \nSSC shocks in the data, that is ~ 5 events in a six year period \ngenerate a change in IMF magnitude greater than 25 nT. \n \nThis result has a direct application to real-time and near-time \nionospheric propagation prediction in respect of the predicted \nchange in median value of absorption following a disturbance \nthe D-region. \n \n \n \n \n3 Modelling Changes in the E-region \nSporadic-E (Es) is a problem in high latitude HF \ncommunications because of its irregular and as yet \nunpredictable behaviour.  Es has different characteristics in \ndifferent latitudinal zones and there may be several \nmechanisms governing the behaviour of these layers.  The \nhigh latitude Es layers are generally considered to be due to \nparticle precipitation [20, 21, 22, 23].  It has been found that \nelectron precipitation usually is the major cause for the \nformation of the high latitude sporadic E-layer and that the \nmodified wind shear mechanism, which takes into account the \neffect of electric fields, is important under low electron \nprecipitation conditions only, i.e. \u201equiet\u201f conditions [24]. \n \nIn the three to five hours following the onset of geomagnetic \nactivity the ionospheric path is characterised by changes in \nthe mode of propagation.  This is caused by an enhanced \nsporadic-E layer overshadowing the usual F-layer propagation \npaths [25].  These sporadic-E paths are known to be able to \nsupport HF communications during ionospheric storm periods \nand this section presents the results of research that has \nempirically modelled the deviations from the predicated \nmedian of f0Es following the onset of an ionospheric storm \nand provides guidance to HF communications operators for \nmaintaining link establishment. \n \n3.1 Data. \nThe data used in this section is gathered from f-plots \ngenerated at the Sodankyl\u00e4 observatory which is located 120 \nkm north of the Arctic Circle in Finland,  67\u00b0 22\u2032 N, 26\u00b0 38\u2032 \nE, L-value 5.2.  Data for this research work was gathered over \nsix years from the sunspot minimum in 2000 until the near \nsunspot maximum in 2006. \n \nThe f-plot is a daily graph of the frequency characteristics of \nall the daily ionograms as a function of time, using an \ninternationally agreed convention, so that detailed \nobservations from different stations may be compared \nefficiently.  The f-plot provides a summary of the original \nobservations with the minimum of interpretation and enables \ndifficult decisions needed for hourly tabulations to be made \nwith due consideration of all the available data.  This is \nparticularly important at high latitude stations were blackouts, \nspread echoes or rapidly changing oblique reflections \nfrequently prevent the normal characteristics from being \nobserved on individual hourly ionogram records.  Figure 3 is \nan example of an f-plot used in this analysis. \n \nIt has been acknowledged that the f-plot is a valuable tool for \nidentifying variations in the ionosphere, in the interpretation \nof complex records, particularly at high latitudes and it has \nbecome a primary tool for analysing the hour-to-hour or day-\nto-day changes in the ionosphere [26]. \n \n \nFigure 3:  Example of an f-plot - the arrow at 18:50 MLT \nindicates the occurrence time of the SSC. \n \nThe starting point for this study is again the occurrence of an \nSSC indicating the occurrence of magnetospheric changes \nand modifications to the ionosphere \u2013 that is the onset of a \ndisturbed state.   In order to collect data that captures all the \nE-layer effects which are initiated with a SSC occurring, data \nis collected for the four hours following SSC.  In order to \naccumulate an adequate number of samples the day was split \ninto four sectors. Sector A covering the period 0-6 MLT, \nsector B covering 6-12 MLT, sector C covering 12-18 MLT \nand sector D covering 18-24 MLT. \n \nFor each of the four hours following an SSC, the following \nstatistics are collected for each sector from the f-plot:  The \nmean, median, minimum, maximum, lower quartile and upper \nquartile of the change in critical frequency (\u0394foE) that occurs \nin each sector as well as the onset of screening (total \nblanketing) that occurs in each sector. \n \nThe difference in critical frequency measured on each hour \nfollowing an SSC event is used to define the variability that \noccurs.  This difference is designated in this paper as \u0394foEn-m \nwhere \u0394foE is the change in hourly E-layer critical frequency \nand n and m indicate which hour following the SSC is being \nmeasured.  These values reflect the reduction or increase in E-\nlayer ionisation due to all applicable factors.  However as \nenhanced ionisation due to particle precipitation which is by \nfar the dominant ionisation source, \u0394foEn-m captures \npredominantly the influence of particle precipitation. \n \n3.2 Results. \nThis section examines the variability of Es in the four hours \nfollowing an SSC as well as the occurrence of screening.  \nPolar plots are used in figure 4 where the radial axis is \u0394foE \nand the clock hours indicate local time.  The solid dots \nindicate where full screening of the F layers occurred.  The \nassociated line, scatter and error bar plot shows the mean \n(diamond) and median (circles) values of \u0394foEm-n per sector, \nthe 25% and 75% percentiles between vertical error bars and \nthe count of events in the lower panel.   \n \nThe statistics show considerable variation, as is expected \nwhen working with the ionosphere in general and which is \namplified when dealing with the high-latitude ionosphere.  A \nnumber of significant points are noted from examining the \nplots of figure 4.  It is noted that \u0394foE0-1 can be positive and \nnegative, this depends on whether or not storm induced \nprecipitation has commenced in this hour or not.  Full \nblanketing (screening) can occur even when \u0394foE0-1 is \nnegative.  This implies that the F-layer ionisation has \ndramatically reduced so even though the E-layer might be \npenetrated, no F-layer reflecting plane exists.  Screening can \noccur when \u0394foE0-1 is zero and this implies that F-layer \nionisation is severely reduced or particle precipitation is \nmaintaining a thick highly ionised Es-layer. \n \nIn the first hour following SSC when \u0394foE0-1   exceeds 2.1 \nMHz the onset of screening is guaranteed.  Screening occurs \nin all sectors in the first hour (\u0394foE0-1) except between 6 \u2013 12 \nMLT (Sector B) where only one out of 33 events over a six \nyear period caused screening in the first hour.  Screening \noccurs extensively in the second hour when \u0394foE1-2 exceeds 1 \nMHz and exclusively when \u0394foE1-2 exceeds 2.1 MHz, \nidentical to what occurs in the first hour (\u0394foE0-1).    \n \nIn the third hour \u0394foE2-3  \u2248 2.1 MHz continues to be a \nmilestone indicator that guarantees screening will occur, with \nonly one exception occurring in six years of data.  The \nextensive occurrence of screening greatly increases in the \nthird hour when \u0394foE2-3 exceeds 0.5 MHz which is \nsignificantly less than in previous hours. \n \nIn the fourth hour \u0394foE3-4 \u2248 3 MHz is now a new milestone \nindicator that guarantees screening will occur.  The extensive \noccurrence of screening at negative values of \u0394foE3-4 in the \nfourth hour indicates that F-layer ionisation has dramatically \nreduced and that there is no F-layer reflecting plane even if \nthe E-layer is penetrated.  In this hour a \u0394foE3-4 \u2248 2.1 MHz \nagain provides a good threshold with screening occurring \nexclusively in sectors C and D above this level. \n \nRing currents during magnetic storms move the auroral region \n(at the pole ward boundary of the trapping region toward the \nequator.  All field lines from the auroral zone touch the outer \nboundary of the magnetosphere, thus allowing particle \ninjection.  This explains the highest \u0394foEm-n values that occur \nin sector D (18-24MLT) as sector D is when the field lines are \nopen to direct particle injection, directly opposite to sector B \n(9-12 MLT).  Sector A and Sector C have similar statistics \nand variance reflecting their intermediate position between \nsector D and sector B. \n \nIt can be seen from figure 4 that Es often fully screens the F-\nlayer leaving the operator little choice but to rely on Es layer \nreflections instead of F-layer reflections.  Noting the sector in \nwhich a SSC occurs allows the operator, using the \ninformation in figure 4, to modify the operating frequency \nestablished by standard prediction methodologies to \ncompensate for the change brought on by ionospheric \ndisturbances to the E-region.  \n4 Conclusion \nHF radiocommunications is still an essential service at high \nlatitudes even though the HF channel is adversely affected by \nthe impact of space weather.  Hence the importance of \nadvancing the prediction of propagation during disturbed \nperiods. \n \nUsing the occurrence of SSC as the defining point of the \ntransition between a \u201equiet\u201f and \u201edisturbed\u201f ionosphere  \nensures a well defined and understood starting point from \nwhich to both gather data and predict the deviation of critical \nionospheric parameters from the expected norm following the \nonset of disturbances. \n \nThe first manifestation of an ionospheric disturbance is a \nlarge absorption spike lasting tens of minutes that disrupts \nlow to mid HF frequency operations.  The cause of this affect \nis the sudden increase of electron density in the D-layer due \nto deeply penetrating charged particles.  Research has \ndemonstrated that the amplitude of the expected absorption \nspike can be empirically determined based on IMF data.  \nDepending on solar wind velocity, this data is available 30 \u2013 \n60 minutes before the observed step-change in IMF \npropagates to the earth\u201fs magnetosphere. \n \nThe second manifestation of an ionospheric disturbance dealt \nwith in this paper is the formation of intense and prolonged \nEs. Sporadic-E layers are important to consider at high \nlatitudes where they modify the mode of propagation and \noften totally screen the f-layer off.   An investigation into \ndisturbances affecting the E-region has lead to the \ncharacterisation of the change in the median value of the \ncritical frequency of Es and the occurrence of fully-blanketing \nEs follow the onset of disturbances The results detail the \ndeviation of foEs (from its quiet ionosphere value) for the four \nhours immediately following the SSC.   \n \nThe approach adopted in this research is to empirically \npredict the deviation of key ionospheric parameters \n(absorption, f0E and the occurrence of E-layer screening)  \nfrom the median value as predicated by standard propagation \nprediction methodologies.  The strength of this approach is \nthat system operators can adjust for the deviation of critical \nfrequencies from the quiet-ionosphere predictive norm \nwithout the need for a supporting network of vertical and\/or \noblique sounders.    \n \nAcknowledgements \nRiometer data originated from the Imaging Riometer for \nIonospheric Studies (IRIS), operated by the Department of \nCommunications Systems at Lancaster University (UK) in \ncollaboration with the Sodankyl\u00e4 Geophysical Observatory, \nand funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council \n(STFC) \n \nI acknowledge the Sodankyl\u00e4 Geophysical Observatory, \nFinland for use of the f-plot data. \n \nReferences \n[1] F.
