It first appraises the \ncurrent transformations of local government in South Africa, focusing specifically on \nrelationships between gender equality and citizenship on the one hand, and local \ngovernment policy, legislation, and community participation on the other, and then \nexplores meanings of participation and how they inform approaches towards local socio-\neconomic development. The findings of primary research conducted with civil society \norganisations and black women in communities in the Cape Town metropolitan area are \nexplored through three interrelated themes. First, the model of structured participation \nthat is central to South Africa\u201fs democratic transformation is assessed from the \nperspective of black women. Second, cultures of alienation, both within local governance \nstructures and amongst black women and the extent to which recent restructuring is \ncombating or contributing to these are explored. Third, how participation policies are \ndealing with conflict within and between target groups are analysed, whether stake-holder \ngroup politics obliterate important differences in interests and whether alternative \nstructures might be more effective in terms of women\u201fs participation and empowerment. \nFinally, the findings are interpreted in relation to theoretical concepts of good governance \nand participatory democracy, and the potential and problems of realising South Africa\u201fs \ntransformation process toward developmental local government are assessed. \nKey words: South Africa, local government, black women, community participation, \ndevelopment, integrated planning, Cape Town \n 3 \nIntroduction \nThe decentralisation of governance is happening in large parts of the world in response to \nthe privatisation of public services, erosion of economic bases, and cuts in social \nspending. Consequently, the responsibility of promoting local socio-economic \ndevelopment and facilitating community\n1\n participation tends to fall on lower levels or \nspheres of government. This trend can be interpreted in two ways: negatively as a \nwithdrawal of the state, or as a potentially radical model of good governance, signalling a \nshift from local government (the power to govern) to local governance (the act of \ngoverning). The shift is dependent upon the mobilisation and empowerment of civil \nsociety and a citizen-oriented management approach in government institutions. It places \nemphasis on the importance of community participation, including those often \nmarginalised by poverty and gender, the need for partnerships between communities and \ngovernment structures and on accountability. Theoretically, therefore, decentralisation of \ngovernance has the potential to enhance participatory democracy.  \nIn practice, the interpretation of \u201egood governance\u201f determines whether the model \nis a radical means of deepening democracy, or a means of disempowering local \ncommunities. Increasingly, public-private partnerships are considered the most effective \nway to deliver services to communities and in many instances local government is \nincreasingly recognised as lacking in the requisite capacity to deliver those services. \nInterpretations of good governance (favoured by institutions such as the World Bank) that \nemphasise the participation of all interested actors, and the role of the private sector in \nservice delivery, can disempower rather than empower local communities since the \nprivate sector is far less accountable than local government to the communities with \n 4 \nwhich it is meant to be in partnership (Ismail, 1998, 3). However, should good \ngovernance be interpreted as requiring local government to liaise with communities \nbefore making decisions, and promote the rights and duties of communities to govern, \nthen a more radical version of governance would result. Central to this is the promotion \nof local socio-economic development, the empowerment of communities, improved \nliving conditions, greater access to resources and opportunities, poverty alleviation and \nequality. Such models target the poor, historically disadvantaged and women in particular \nin order to benefit the entire community.  \nDebates about \u201egood governance\u201f and participatory democracy are particularly \npertinent to recent and ongoing political transformations in South Africa. This paper \nfocuses on how these transformations are both informed by and might inform \nunderstandings of good governance, specifically at the local level. The new democratic \norder, as defined in the 1996 South African Constitution, requires that local government \nundergo a process of transformation. This is informed by a vision of democratic, \naccountable, effective, participative and developmental local governance (Hilliard and \nKemp, 1999). Women\u201fs equality is recognised as important in realising this vision \nbecause unless the transformation process consciously aims to rectify the social, \neconomic and political marginalisation of women, local government will not become \ndemocratic, accountable, effective, participative or developmental (GAP\/FCR, 1998, 3; \nKehler, 2000, 7). Rather, concepts like developmental local government and \u201egood \ngovernance\u201f will remain abstract theoretical concepts. \nEight years of democracy perhaps constitutes too short a period for assessment of \nradical social changes in South Africa. However, the re-election of an ANC government \n 5 \nin 1999 and the ongoing political transformation at the level of local governance invite \nreflection upon the potential impacts of democratic transformation on the lives of the \nmost marginalised peoples, the majority of whom are women. Foregrounding the \ninterests and experiences of the most marginalised and historically disadvantaged women \nin South Africa (those who are poor, black\n2\n and often living in peri-urban and rural areas) \nis a valuable gauge of progress of the efforts to construct participatory democracy. In \naddition, a focus on black women\u201fs needs is in reality a focus on communal needs, since \nthe responsibility for meeting these is often placed on women (van Donk, 2000). This \npaper approaches some of these issues by focusing on local government transformations \nand their likely impact on community and, specifically, black women\u201fs participation. The \nfirst section provides an introduction to and appraisal of the broader context of local \ngovernment transformations in South Africa, focusing on relationships between gender \nequality and citizenship on the one hand, and local government policy, legislation, and \ncommunity participation on the other. It also outlines concepts and meanings of \nparticipation and how they inform approaches towards local socio-economic \ndevelopment in the South African context. \nThe findings of primary research conducted with civil society organisations and \nXhosa women in communities in the Cape Town metropolitan area (Figure 1)\n3\n are \nexplored through three interrelated themes. First, the model of structured participation \nthat is central to South Africa\u201fs democratic transformation is assessed from the \nperspective of black women. Second, cultures of alienation amongst black women, \ndisillusionment within local governance structures, and the extent to which recent \nrestructuring is combating or contributing to these are explored. Third, the paper reflects \n 6 \non how participation policies are dealing with conflict within and between target groups, \nwhether stake-holder group politics obliterate important differences in interests and \nwhether alternative structures might be more effective in terms of women\u201fs participation \nand empowerment. Finally, the findings are interpreted in relation to theoretical concepts \nof good governance and participatory democracy, and the potential and problems of \nrealising South Africa\u201fs transformation toward developmental local government are \nassessed.  \n \nLocal government transformation: the policy environment \nThe significance of gender \nThe transition from apartheid to post-apartheid witnessed a remarkable shift in gender \npolitics in South Africa, related to the concepts of civil society and citizenship, \nuniversality and equality, and the pluralisation of politics at all levels. Gender issues have \nbeen pivotal to state restructuring, including increased formal political participation of \nwomen (Ballington, 1999a; 1999b), the establishment of the Commission on Gender \nEquality, and other \u201enational machinery\u201f (Albertyn, 1995; McEwan, 2000) to promote \nand maintain gender equality. The gap between de jure and de facto equality, between \naspirations and reality, is still enormous, but the explicit constitutional recognition of \nwomen\u201fs claims to equal citizenship is of considerable significance (du Plessis and \nGouws, 1996). An explicitly gendered democratisation process has had significant \ninfluences on the nature of democracy and citizenship being constructed in South Africa, \nand is likely to continue to do so. \n Despite the primacy given to gender in debates about the structures and processes \n 7 \nof democracy, there has been very little analysis of gender and local government (Cole \nand Parnell, 2000; Robinson, 1995). The ways in which women can access power and \nresources at the local level and their lived experiences of citizenship are still poorly \nunderstood, especially with regard to the majority of women still marginalised by the \nlegacies of apartheid. Since the local government elections of 1995, what analysis there \nhas been has focused on influencing local government policy and budgeting (Budlender, \n1999; Skinner, 1999; Van Donk, 1998a; 1998b; 1999). There is clearly a need, therefore, \nfor a sustained and critical analysis of the relationship between local governance and the \nconstitutional guarantees to gender equality. This is given greater expediency by the fact \nthat the transitional period of local government ended with the elections in 2000 and the \nconstitutional, legal and policy mechanisms (discussed subsequently) are now mostly in \nplace. The transformation process in South Africa presents an excellent opportunity to \nturn local government into a gender sensitive sphere of government. The focus of this \npaper is on external transformation: how local government delivers services and how it \nrelates to communities, if the needs and interests of women are incorporated into local \ngovernment agendas and if previously disadvantaged women are able to participate fully \nin community development.  \nTransforming local government \nChapter 7 of the South African Constitution sets out the policy directive with regard to \nlocal government, clearly assigns it a development role and emphasises the participation \nof communities and community organisations (152(1)). These principles are also central \nto the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), conceived to meet the socio-\neconomic needs of previously disadvantaged communities. Most of the ambitions of RDP \n 8 \nhave not been met (and arguably have been superseded by the neo-liberal macro-\neconomic Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR) framework). Access to and \ncontrol over resources is still based on \u201erace\u201f, gender and class. Consequently, South \nAfrica remains characterised by extreme poverty and social disintegration, mass \nunemployment and the exclusion of the majority of people from socio-economic \ndevelopment and growth (Kehler, 2000). However, many communities remain \u201creplete \nwith RDP and other forums and the language of local participatory processes remain that \nof the RDP\u201d (Morojele, 2000, 26).  \nThe White Paper on Local Government (1998) seeks to facilitate the process of \nlocal government transformation and its role in rectifying social and economic \nimbalances. Section B of the White Paper provides that co-ordination and integration are \nrequired for development planning, there is a need for community participation in local \ngovernment matters, and it is the responsibility of local government to provide \nsustainable service delivery at an affordable level. Recent legislation concerning local \ngovernance aims to create a context in which persistent inequalities can be addressed,\n4\n \nbringing about radical change as municipalities become more accountable to the \nelectorate and as communities, at least theoretically, become more involved in local \ngovernance. The new dispensation requires creativity and participation from all levels of \nsociety for its success.  \nIntegrated Development Planning \nIntegrated Development Planning (IDP) is seen as the means to achieve developmental \nand participative local government, requiring that different departments link their plans, \nobjectives, budgets, resource auditing, performance monitoring and community \n 9 \nconsultation in a process of co-operative governance (Department of Constitutional \nDevelopment, 1998, 10). IDPs should align all available resources towards development \ngoals, integrate local activities, prioritise objectives, and be \u201eparticipative\u201f in nature, \nenvironmentally sustainable and aimed at poverty alleviation. Emphasis is on effective \nand affordable service delivery, local development and community participation: \nIDP is a process by which the planning efforts of not only various spheres and \nsectors of government and other institutions, but, also, of the various economic, \nsocial, environmental, legal, infrastructural and spatial aspects of a problem or \nplan are integrated \u2013 brought together \u2013 in a way that enhances development and \nprovides for sustainable empowerment, growth and equity for the short, medium \nand long term. (IDASA, 1998, 6) \nThe importance assigned to community participation in all spheres of the IDP process \nreflects the concepts of \u201ebringing government to the people\u201f and active public \nparticipation in socio-economic development. Thus, IDP is potentially one of the most \nimportant tools in the transformation of local government, conceived as the main \ninstrument for ensuring that local government can fulfil its new developmental role in \novercoming the socio-economic, institutional and spatial fragmentation of the past (Otzen \net al., 1999, 7).  \nPrinciples of public participation have \u201cto be institutionalised in order to ensure \nthat all residents of the country have an equal right to participate\u201d (Department of \nProvincial and Local Government, 2001, 9, original emphasis). The impossibility of \ndirect participation of the majority of residents in planning processes is recognised; IDP \nlegislation demands that clear rules and procedures are established specifying who is to \n 10 \nparticipate, on behalf of whom, on which issue, through which organisational mechanism \nand to what effect (\u201cstructured participation\u201d). Emphasis is on accommodating diversity, \nin terms of participation styles and cultures, creating conditions for participation, \nencouraging the participation of \u201cdisadvantaged or marginalised groups\u201d and \u201cgender \nequity\u201d (ibid., 10).  \nDefining participation \nHow participation is defined in the new legislation is clearly of significance. According \nto the World Bank, \u201cparticipation is a process through which stakeholders influence and \nshare control over development initiatives and the decisions and resources which affect \nthem\u201d (in Otzen, 1999, 6). Similarly, \u201cCommunity\/public\/citizen participation is the act \nof allowing individual citizens within a community to take part in the formulation of \npolicies and proposals on issues that affect the whole community\u201d (Onibokun and \nFaniran, 1995, 9). More radical definitions of participation, however, not only emphasise \ncommunity involvement in the processes of local development, but also demand that \nsocial development lead to the empowerment of community members. This involves \nsocial change to bring about improved living standards within the community and is \nespecially significant to women. South Africa is characterised by a lack of strong civil \nsociety structures that can represent the interests of the majority of community members \nas well as an apparent lack of capacity amongst citizens to respond meaningfully to the \ncomplex matters of governance (Liebenberg, 1999, 6). Therefore, emphasis on \nparticipation is crucial, and the formerly disadvantaged must be central targets for \nparticipation as key to social development. As Kehler (2000, 5) argues, in this context, \nparticipation is defined as: \n 11 \nThe organised efforts to increase the control over and access to resources and \nregulative institutions in society, on the part of individual citizens, groups and \nmovements of those hitherto excluded from such control aimed at the socio-\neconomic development of the whole community. \nParticipation is an end in itself. It is imperative, therefore, to explore the relative \nsuccesses and failures of translating policy into meaningful and effective participation at \nthe local level, and whether the structured participation outlined in IDP legislation will \nenable radical participation for all groups.  \n \nWomen\u2019s Experiences of Structured Participation in Cape Town \nSince the creation of the Cape Town Unicity municipality in 2000, a number of \ncommunity forums, known as ACTs (Area Co-ordinating Teams), are being established \nto facilitate local government communication with communities (FCR, 2000, 12). \nAlthough there is some uncertainty within the Unicity regarding how the old community \nstructures will fit into IDP structures, attempts are being made to create new partnerships \nto facilitate structured participation within even the poorest of communities. In order to \nassess the effectiveness of these, interviews were conducted with representatives of \ncommunity-based partnerships that have been established to operationalise IDP in \nGugulethu, one of Cape Town\u201fs oldest \u201eAfrican\u201f5 townships, and Khayelitsha, a peri-\nurban township 30-40 km from Cape Town.\n6\n Representatives of NGOs working to build \ncapacity within communities and local government, as well as representatives of \nwomen\u201fs groups were also interviewed. Finally, a survey of the perceptions of women \ncommunity members on participation and local governance was undertaken. In-depth \n 12 \ninterviews were conducted with 40 black women in various locations in Khayelitsha \n(Figure 2)\n7\n to ascertain attitudes on community needs and local socio-economic \ndevelopment, the extent and quality of their participation within IDP processes, and \nknowledge and understanding of IDP.\n8\n Generally, Khayelitsha is characterised by a lack \nof infrastructure and service delivery, high unemployment rates and poverty, high rates of \nin-migration from the impoverished Eastern Cape, and a high proportion of female-\nheaded households.\n9\n Participation in local governance and socio-economic development \nis, therefore, of considerable importance to women in Khayelitsha. \n Several projects have been initiated since the mid-1990s aimed at creating new \ncommunity structures and operationalising IDP in Cape Town\u201fs townships. External \ndonors fund some (the Isilimela Project in Khayelitsha, for example, is funded by the \nBritish Government Department for International Development) and all involve some sort \nof public-private sector partnership. They aim to build co-ordination and integration, \nestablish synergies and partnerships, and counter misunderstanding and conflict within \ncommunities and between communities and local government. They attempt to establish \nsystematic measurements of development need and progress so impacts can be measured, \nand so that strategically important groups such as women, youth and emerging \nentrepreneurs are not excluded (Solomon, 2000, 43). One example is the Community \nDevelopment Co-operative (CDC) in Gugulethu, a community-based organisation \n(CBO), based on similar models in the US, designed to foster local community \ndevelopment by involving local people and private businesses to generate employment \nand improved housing\/infrastructure. It was created in 1997 as part of IDP measures \n(interview with Ms Noni Ndema, General Manager, 24.1.01). Local women have \n 13 \nbenefited directly from CDC\u201fs projects, especially from house-building projects. Some \nhave also benefited indirectly from the local economic development generated by the \nbuilding projects. In addition, through their involvement in consultation with CDC, \nwomen have also contributed to the types of development being prioritised. For example, \na toilet-building project, initiated through IDP, was completed in July 2001: \nMany formal houses in Gugulethu do have toilets, but they are outside and several \nmetres away from the house. This creates problems for senior citizens, people \nwith disabilities, and for women, since there have been several incidents of rape at \nnight. Women in the local community identified this project, which relocates the \ntoilet adjacent to the house with an entrance from inside the house itself, as a \npriority. The Minister for Health suggested that 1000 toilets should be built and \nhas allocated R3 million to the project\u2026 CDC conducted door-to-door market \nresearch to identify those people most in need based on age, gender, ability and so \non. (Ms Ndema, 24.1.01)  \nProjects such as this attempt to give leadership back to local people and have also \nattempted to involve women.  \nThe links between CDC and the community, and between CDC and local \ngovernment, are formed through existing RDP community structures: \nRDP has a community liaison officer who liases between the community and \nCDC, but local people do not have direct membership of CDC as they do in the \nUS\u2026 This is likely to change in future because not everyone in Gugulethu can be \ninvolved in community structures\u2026 Only the Chair of the RDP sits on the board \n 14 \nof CDC; other members of the board are councillors and business people. (Ms \nNdema, 24.1.01)  \nDespite attempts to consult women, therefore, there is the potential at present for already \nmarginalised residents to be excluded from participation in CDC projects and in \ncommunity development in Gugulethu. The extent to which residents are setting the \nagenda for development projects is still rather nebulous. Similar problems have also been \nidentified in other township initiatives. The Isilimela project in Khayelitsha, for example, \nhas revealed a lack of capacity within community leadership regarding rules and \nprocedures of local governance, conflict within communities regarding participation and \nthe continued exclusion of groups such as young people and women, and the failure of \ncommunity representatives to communicate with local residents (Solomon, 2000). The \nproject has not met its aims to capacitate communities to engage with the local \ngovernment IDP and to create local development partnerships. \nEvidence from interviews with women in Khayelitsha reveals a number of \nproblems regarding structured participation. Just over half the women interviewed live in \nformal housing; the rest live in shacks. Levels of education in Khayelitsha are relatively \nhigh and a majority of respondents have at least basic literacy skills. They therefore have \nthe capacity to fully participate in community matters if no other constraints exist. In \naddition, because of the high rates of unemployment,\n10\n poor housing and poor living \nconditions, these women have every incentive to be active in IDP projects in their areas: \nWe can\u201ft wait for the government to give us the things that they decide we need. \nWe have to get involved and tell them what we need and how things should \nprogress. Then we will improve our communities\u2026 (LB, Harare, 8.2.01) \n 15 \nAnother respondent argues:  \nIf we sit around and wait nothing will be done and things will get worse. We have \nto fight for things and make improvements. We just need to know how. (AM, Site \nB, 9.2.01) \n This desire to be involved in community development projects is echoed in nearly all of \nthe interviews, as is the frustration of not knowing how to participate. Many women are \nmembers of street or area committees, which operate almost like village structures in \nKhayelitsha, but very few are involved with civic organisations or in community \nleadership. Indeed, few of the respondents express any knowledge of civic organisations \nwithin their areas. A few are members of housing savings schemes, and through these \nhave acquired formal housing; they tend to be more satisfied with their own involvement \nin their communities, but still express dissatisfaction with local governance and a lack of \nconsultation over socio-economic development. \n With regard to community participation, the majority of respondents either \nbelieve that there are no IDP projects in their communities or say that they do not know \nof any, indicating their marginalisation in community development. However, when \nasked about participants in CBOs, most identify women, political organisations, senior \ncitizens and youths as the major participants. In both Harare and Site B, a majority of \nrespondents acknowledge women\u201fs involvement in CBOs: \nYes, women are very much involved here. Women are involved in most things \ntaking place. We can\u201ft afford to just wait for things to happen. We are also the \nmost in need. (AX, Harare, 8.2.01) \nIn areas where black women have a history of participation in CBOs they also seem more \n 16 \ninvolved in local development projects. Participation is seemingly more difficult in those \nmore recently formed and informal settlements. A large majority of women in all areas \nstate that they either did not know if local government tried to involve women in their \nactivities or state clearly that there have been no attempts to do so. Only five of the \nrespondents know of attempts to involve women in development projects. This suggests a \ngeneral failure on the part of the local government to inform or educate communities \nabout the possibilities of participation and the importance of this to the successful \ntransformation toward developmental local government. This is further evidenced by the \nfact that a majority of women have received no information or education relating to \nparticipation from local IDP structures. Consequently, disappointment about the \nperformance of local government and its failure to engage with communities is common. \nAs one woman states: \nThere are lots of people here who want to improve our areas but we never see \nanyone or hear anything from them. It\u201fs as if we don\u201ft exist. (PD, Site A, 6.2.01) \nAll but two of the interviewees believe that women have the ability to and should \nbe involved in local development. When asked about how participation could be \nimproved they mention the need for training workshops run at times when women are \nable to attend: \nWe need more training, but this is no good if the workshops are at times when \nwomen cannot attend because they are working or caring for children. (LB, \nHarare, 8.2.01) \nOther respondents refer to the need for women\u201fs education and the need for local \ngovernment to give them the opportunity to participate. Most interviewees articulate the \n 17 \nimportance of community involvement in all stages of development projects, from needs \nassessment to project planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. \nLack of information is seen by most to be important in restricting their participation. The \nmost common method of communication used, according to the respondents, is a \nloudspeaker, which makes announcements easy to miss. However, several also say that \npublic meetings are held, which is encouraging because it facilitates immediate \nparticipation and community involvement, although it can disadvantage women whose \ntime is already constrained. Radio is rarely mentioned, which is surprising given its \nusefulness as a means of communicating to those marginalised through illiteracy. Given \nthe relatively high rates of education, letters might also be a useful means of information, \nbut few respondents mention written communication.  \nThe level of socio-economic development within communities clearly has a direct \nbearing upon women\u201fs degree of access to information and, therefore, opportunities for \nparticipation. One of the respondents, a 60-year old mother, grandmother and sole \nbreadwinner for the family, explains the (not atypical) constraints on her participation: \nEvery day I get up at 5am to prepare breakfast for the children and walk to the \ntrain station. When I get home from work in the evenings I have to feed my \ndaughter and her children and take care of the house. I just moved into my first \nhouse from a shack.  I don\u201ft have to carry water now, but there is still a lot of \nwork to be done, plastering and so on\u2026 My daughter is ill. I don\u201ft have time to \nattend meetings during the week, even in the evenings. (LT, Site B, 19.3.01) \nThere is a persistent lack of understanding within communities and local government of \nthe multiple tasks that black women perform and how time consuming they are at home, \n 18 \nin the community and in the economic sector. They tend to have less flexibility than men, \nless leisure time and less time to participate in public events, particularly if they are heads \nof households, as many women are in Khayelitsha. Perhaps most alarmingly, only three \nof the respondents are aware of IDP. The majority have no idea what the term means or \nof its significance to local communities and their participation in local socio-economic \ndevelopment. If the concept of IDP is not being communicated its effectiveness in social \ndevelopment has to be questioned. As one respondent asks: \u201cWhy do we not know about \nIDP? If we do not know about it, how can we make people in government understand our \nneeds?\u201d (PD, Site A, 6.2.01) \n \nCultures of alienation and disillusionment \nThe success of local government transformation depends upon the success of IDP \nmeasures in enabling the structured participation of very large numbers of people. The \nbiggest threat is the development of cultures of alienation within communities and \ndisillusionment within local governance structures. Under apartheid, local government \nwas responsible for implementing policies of segregation, forced removals and the \nroutine destruction of informal settlements. Memories of this persist in Cape Town and it \nis imperative that cultures of alienation are not allowed to develop through lack of trust \nand participation and disillusionment within communities. However, initial research \nsuggests that there is already some cynicism within poor communities, where conditions \nare not perceived to have improved, and also within local government itself. \n One significant cause of alienation among black women in Khayelitsha is the \ngeneral lack of socio-economic development, as well as their exclusion from decision-\n 19 \nmaking processes. Very few of the respondents speak favourably of service delivery in \ntheir areas. Some in Site B mention delivery of water services and sanitation as well as \nsome housing, but none were consulted about these improvements. As one respondent \npoints out:  \nNew houses are built by the savings schemes - Masithembane and HOSHOP. \nThey are not coming from the government. We don\u201ft live close enough to the \nhousing schemes and we don\u201ft know where the offices are. We can\u201ft save the \nmoney so we cannot join the schemes. So how is the government helping us? \n(CD, Site B, 9.2.01) \nSome Site B and Harare respondents note that local government has delivered water, \nhousing and community halls. However, a majority of respondents state that they are not \nhappy with the level of development. Recent severe flooding and pressures from \nunabated in-migration are perceived as exacerbating problems. A number of women \nexpress resentment at radio reports that the newly elected Democratic Alliance local \ngovernment has back-tracked on pledges to provide all households with an amount of \nfree water and electricity: \nFirst they tell us we will have free water and electricity and now they tell us \nbecause we are [in] Khayelitsha and not Gugulethu or Nyanga that we cannot \nhave this. (SM, Site A, 6.2.01) \nMost women do not believe that local government will deliver outstanding services \nbefore the end of the year. Several believe that this non-delivery is related to party-\npolitics: \nThe services go to the places that support this [DA] government. We don\u201ft \n 20 \nsupport them so they are not interested in us. (PS, Site B, 9.2.01) \nDisparity exists in Khayelitsha between community needs, as defined by the \nrespondents, and local government. This is reflected in growing disappointment and \ndissatisfaction with the non-delivery of services and in the non-involvement of \ncommunities.\n11\n  Participation in specified local governance activities (i.e. budget process, \nhousing, water and electrification projects) - a requirement of IDP legislation - is \nalarmingly low. None of the respondents have ever been involved in budget processes: \nThe government thinks women don\u201ft understand budgets and so they don\u201ft \nbother... Listen, every woman here knows about budgets because they deal with \nthem every day. (PN, Site A, 6.2.01) \nThe vast majority have not been involved in housing, water or electrification projects, \nand most have no knowledge of other members of their community being involved. This \nindicates a profound failure by the local government to meet community needs in \nKhayelitsha, to deliver services and to facilitate community participation. Most \nrespondents express disappointment at the failure of local government to involve them \nmore directly and to develop an understanding of what is needed in their areas.  \nMost interviewees have not attended any IDP or local government meetings nor \nhave met their councillor since the local government elections. This highlights the non-\nparticipatory nature of current community-government relationships. However, this does \nnot reflect disinterest because most women attended several community meetings and \nonly nine of the respondents had not attended any recent meetings. Women are involved \nin matters that concern them and projects that are initiated and based in their \ncommunities. They are less involved in projects that are launched without consultation \n 21 \nand therefore fail to adequately address their needs. Nearly all express disillusionment \nwith their non-involvement. One woman states: \nWe are never asked for our opinion on what should be done. If anything happens \nit comes from the council and we are not asked for the things that we think are \nimportant\u2026 No, we are not consulted about what we need. (XM, Site B, 9.2.01) \nEvidence of disillusionment within local government is only likely to compound \nalienation within communities. One recent report reveals that while Cape Town local \ngovernment is attempting to make community participation a meaningful process, there \nare many that are critical of how the process of engaging communities is being practised \n(FCR, 2000). Some officials believe that public participation is mostly implemented \nwhen local government is required to budget for the forthcoming financial year: \nLast year with the IDP the whole year went by with no meeting, and all of a \nsudden when it came to the budgets there were meetings. (ibid., 22) \nCommunity participation, as envisaged in IDP legislation, has not yet been implemented:  \nOur participation is around particular projects. There is not yet a system \u2013 and \nthere seems to be no intention of starting an IDP process \u2013 to get community \norganisation to start thinking on a broader basis. (ibid., 22) \nIn one case, IDP sessions in 2000 were poorly attended because the community had been \ninvolved previously and had made submissions, but the lack of feedback meant trust was \nlost (ibid., 25). Trust is easily broken when memories of local councils in the apartheid \nera are invoked by white councillors and broken promises. Rebuilding trust requires \nempowering people with information and knowledge of development planning. The \nimportance of facilitating community participation, as part of IDP processes, is \n 22 \nrecognised by officials, but is often only undertaken according to legal requirements and \nnot due to a true commitment to ensure participation (ibid., 40). \nFurthermore, hidden barriers to participation exist in institutionalised participation \nprocesses. One example involves Masipumelele, an informal settlement of 10,000 people \nnear Kommetjie. The councillor for Masipumelele states that she was not involved in the \ninitial stages of IDP participation due to illness. Subsequently, she did not receive any \ndocumentation and was not informed even of the resulting budget and its links with IDP \nand participation processes. She has no knowledge that any person from Masipumelele \nwas, or is currently, involved as a representative in IDP processes. The municipal plenary \nreport back did not have any representatives from Masipumelele present (Urban Sector \nNetwork, 2001, 23-4). This, in effect means that the marginalised are further alienated \ndue to circumstance and no special allowances are made for lack of capacity in some \ncommunities. \nAnother report suggests that attempts to involve communities, and especially \nblack women, are still largely failing and councillors do not seem to take public \nparticipation seriously (Kehler, 2000, 18-19). Community representatives do not always \nfilter information downwards, which further alienates poorer people. Although officials \nrecognise that it is important that communities are empowered to participate \nmeaningfully in terms of knowledge of technical aspects, budgetary processes and the \nlike, very little has been done in this regard. Participation is not seen through the lens of \nsocial disintegration, conflict and self-interested leadership that are apparent in many \ntownships. There are also high anxiety levels within the councils due to the ongoing \nrestructuring and staff morale is generally very low. Consequently, it seems that there is \n 23 \nno real commitment to integration regarding \u201erace\u201f and gender in local government \nprocesses. \nThe South African Local Government Association, a statutory body that is \nrepresented at central government level, will play a vital role in enabling local \ngovernment to fulfil the mandate of the electorate. However, effective governance of \npoverty and inequality, which is also clearly gendered and racialised, is dependent upon \ninstitutional structures that are capable of responding to the needs of the poor and the \nmarginalised. Although it is relatively easy to redesign formal institutions, underlying \nsocietal institutions are much slower to change. Bornstein (2000:202-203) argues that the \nredesign of public sector governance structures has outpaced the ability of the relevant \norganisations to change: \nMany local and provincial government agencies suffer severe human and \nfinancial capacity constraints and, in the absence of a thorough shift in \ncommitment to human rights, the rule of law, gender equality and open electoral \nprocesses, may continue with attitudes and practices characteristic of the \napartheid era.  \nDemocratic reforms do not necessarily help the marginalised unless the institutions of \ngovernment are improved in terms of popular participation. Institutional structures at the \nlocal level still have a tendency to exclude already marginalised peoples, especially black \nwomen. Political exclusion of women is generally more pronounced at the level of local \ngovernment and the relative absence of women\u201fs representation and organising at this \nlevel could be a serious hindrance to the advancement of gender equality (Agenda, 2000; \nRobinson, 1995) and women\u201fs participation in socio-economic development more \n 24 \nbroadly. In Cape Town, for example, only 19% of all elected councillors are women; 15-\n20% of local government employees are women (GAP\/FCR, 1998, 10). As a minority \ngroup, it is more difficult for women to raise their concerns and change institutional \npractices. Relatively few black women hold decision-making and management positions \n(still dominated by white men), and most are found in administrative and clerical \npositions. The potential of a lack of representation and participation in local issues to \ngenerate cultures of alienation is apparent in the fact that the turnout at the 2000 local \ngovernment elections was only 48% (Local Government Transformer, 2001). \n \nGroup politics, conflict and alternative structures of participation \nGiven the evidence of the lack of participation of black women in local governance, \nfurther questions need to be asked regarding the effectiveness of IDP. These questions \nrelate to issues such as elite co-optation, how participation policies deal with conflict \nwithin and between target groups, whether stakeholder group politics obliterate important \ndifferences in interests and whether IDP structures are the most effective means through \nwhich black women can articulate their interests.  \nEvidence of elite co-optation exists in Cape Town, especially in areas like \nKommetjie, where informal settlements like Masipumelele are located within the same \nadministrative boundaries as affluent white suburbs. In these areas, affluent people are \nheavily involved in local fora and thus control the direction of resources. As Govender \n(1999, 4) argues, in many authorities country clubs, golf clubs and horse riding societies \ncontinue to access money that should be reprioritised to organisations working with the \nmost needy. Problems over political alignment are also evident in Cape Town, not least \n 25 \nbecause of the schism between DA and ANC councillors, which affects decision-making \nand policy delivery, and the role that historical enmities play in interactions between \nparties and aligned officials. CBOs in African townships, such as women\u201fs groups and \nresidents\u201f associations, have found themselves at loggerheads with the local council \nbecause they are seen to be affiliated to the \u201eother\u201f party (ibid., 24). Despite formal \nparticipation channels being open to these organisations, no approval for projects can get \nthrough the \u201eother\u201f party-dominated council: \nThe undue politicisation of local councils has in this case led to a situation where, \nalthough participation is encouraged through the IDP processes certain \ncommunities are systematically excluded by daily \u201einformal\u201f practices of the \ncouncil. (ibid, 24) \nIn interviews with representatives of South African National Civic Organisation in Langa \n(29.1.01), it became clear that the relationship between civic organisations and local \ngovernment is problematic and seems to hinder local socio-economic development \nprocesses. Local government often does not consult civic structures, which represent a \nlarge number of community members and, especially, women, and does not recognise the \nrole of CBOs, which are often accused of being anti-development. \n One recent report, based on a survey of officials in the Western Cape, suggests \nthat gender issues are even more sidelined within local government (GAP\/FCR, 1998, 4). \nMost fail to show an understanding of the structural nature of gender inequalities; some \nshow resistance to address gender issues. They believe that if women should receive any \n\u201especial\u201f treatment or consideration, this would constitute unfair discrimination. In terms \nof the external dimensions of local government, (governance, planning and service \n 26 \ndelivery) the report found that a gender perspective is lacking. There is little \nunderstanding of the need to identify different social (interest) groups in the community, \nwho may require different approaches to enhance their participation in community \nprocesses.  \nWhile IDP legislation recognises the importance of women\u201fs participation, \npresent structures are insensitive to cultural differences among women. For example, one \nIDP handbook explains: \u201cEvery local grouping has elites who dominate decision-making \nand whose views do not necessarily reflect those of the majority\u201d and \u201cWomen, in \nparticular, are excluded from local decision-making. Special efforts must be made to hear \ntheir views as local decisions will affect them most\u201d (John, 1997, 41). However, there is \nno recognition within IDP provisions of how cultural norms surrounding gender roles \nalso exacerbate the problems of non-participation. This is a particular problem in Cape \nTown\u201fs Xhosa communities: \nI don\u201ft say anything at the meetings. The men do all the talking. Even though I \nmight have opinions about things I don\u201ft raise them at the meetings. (AM, Site B, \n9.2.01) \nWe women are expected to keep quiet in meetings. We end up with football \npitches instead of cr\u00e8ches. (XM, Harare, 8.2.01) \nCultural norms often restrict Xhosa women\u201fs participation in meetings to observation and \nthey do not contribute beyond this. Despite the respect accorded older women in Xhosa \ncommunities they too are largely passive observers. As a consequence, few women-\nrelated issues are raised and included in programmes.  \n 27 \nIDP is a relatively recent process and it is still too early to determine its success or \nfailure with regard to facilitating community and women\u201fs participation in local socio-\neconomic development. It is at present unclear how IDP structures can deal with the \npolitical co-optation of vulnerable target groups, like black women, by partisan interests \nin communities. In the light of initial evidence from Cape Town, questions remain as to \nwhether IDP structures are the most effective means of enabling women\u201fs participation. \nIs it the case that external donors and private companies are now setting agendas and \npreviously disadvantaged people remain marginalised in decision-making processes \nwithin their communities? Given that community leadership is still dominated by men in \nmost townships, are there perhaps more effective means of facilitating women\u201fs \nparticipation in local democracy and socio-economic development than the structured \nparticipation required of IDP?  \nCities like Cape Town are replete with women\u201fs organisations that pre-date both \nRDP and IDP and take a rather different approach to community development and \nparticipation. The relative successes of these organisations raise questions about the \neffectiveness of imposing models of participation from above. For example, the Skills \nTraining Project in Langa, Cape Town\u201fs oldest township, is a CBO dealing with poverty \nand lack of opportunity through advocating self-help and community agency. It attempts \nto harness grassroots energies and sees service delivery by agents of the state as \nimpossible and undesirable.\n12\n Women in leadership positions have backgrounds in labour \norganisations and, therefore, have experience and organisational skills. They help people \nform co-operatives and acquire skills to make them more employable. Methods include \nsavings, feeding and gardening schemes (survival strategies during apartheid and still \n 28 \nimportant ways of organising for poor women); skills include brick-making and sewing. \nOne aim is encouraging women to participate: \u201cWomen have historically been second \nplace in our societies and they don\u201ft always know their own potential\u201d (Mrs ZM, \n15.2.01). While women are initially trained in brick-making skills, they often stay \ntogether and organise other activities such as sewing groups, which have become \nespecially important to the largely unskilled women moving to Cape Town from rural \nareas. Without skills and references, these women struggle to get jobs and the co-\noperatives provide an important alternative: \nWomen\u201fs economic independence is key, which is why we have different \nschemes \u2013 sewing, gardening, brick-making. We do not see certain jobs fit only \nfor men and others fit only for women. We have to make sure that women are \ngiven opportunities to escape their impoverishment. Women are now doing \nimportant jobs in our country and in our communities. We are building houses. \nWe are working to uplift everyone. (Mrs ZM, 15.2.01) \nNathi Sinako, a 600-member women\u201fs business organisation is one several CBOs \nperforming similar functions in Khayelitsha. Initiated in 1995, membership comprises \nhawkers, informal shops, small supermarkets, dressmakers, hairdressers, brick-makers \nand florists. It has accredited sewing and business training programmes (Dyantyi and \nFrater, 1998). Similarly, Zenzele (\u201edo it yourself\u201f) Enterprises began in 1988 as a sewing \nclub and grew into a training centre by 1990, focusing on women\u201fs empowerment (ibid.). \nCape Town is also replete with independent and community-run housing savings \nand building schemes. One of the most well-known and successful in the Western Cape is \nthe Victoria Mxenge Scheme (Site B North), completed with the assistance of the South \n 29 \nAfrican Homeless People\u201fs Federation. Khayelitsha residents originally scoffed at this \nscheme, founded and controlled by women (Mitlin, 2000, 16). How could women only \nable to save cents ever build houses? However, within 5 years of its founding in 1991, \nVictoria Mxenge was a flagship housing development with 140 new houses; many \nsubsequent schemes were directly inspired by its successes. There are now 78 housing \nsaving schemes operating in Western Cape, nine in Site B alone,\n13\n and numbers continue \nto grow. Women run most and all have predominantly female membership. They are a \ncommunity-centred, community-driven process of developmental change independent of \nlocal government but utilising government subsidies and the capacity-building skills of \nNGOs.\n14\n  \nFor IDP to be successful it might follow the example of inclusion set by these \ncommunity-driven development schemes, which are less about \u201ebringing government to \nthe people\u201f and more about working with and developing existing capacities. CBOs \nprovide an important intermediary between the state and communities and are essential in \nsustaining a strong democratic culture as advocates and articulators of community needs \nand aspirations (Bollens, 2000). If the energies that already exist within communities, and \nparticularly within women\u201fs organisations, are properly harnessed, participative \ncommunity development can be operationalised by local government. \n \nConclusions \nWhile the central state has stepped back from full involvement in development in South \nAfrica, this has largely been through the orchestrated delegation of powers to local and \nprovincial governments (Beall, 2000). Unlike experiences in the north, the level of state \n 30 \ninvolvement in service provision to low-income communities has not diminished with the \ngrowing legitimacy of the state, but has grown. \u201cParticipatory development in South \nAfrica is in fact increasingly controlled by the state\u201d (Lyons et al., 2000, 63). The system \nof local government in South Africa is a world-first in many ways because it requires \ncreativity and participation from all levels of society for its success and this is embedded \nin legislation. However, it remains to be seen whether impoverished areas will have \nimproved access to resources, and whether the new structures will facilitate the \nparticipation of the poor, and especially black women, given their existing \ndisempowerment within communities.  \n The case studies in Cape Town have demonstrated that even though local \ngovernment has followed IDP guidelines, it is failing to foster meaningful participation, \nespecially amongst black women. The latter have not been involved in development \nprojects and also perceive local government as having failed its mandate to facilitate \nparticipation. There is a general dissatisfaction with the performance of local \ngovernment. All spheres of government in South Africa are espousing public-private \npartnerships as the way forward to effective and participatory local government. In \nreality, however, these partnerships focus more on the \u201coutsourcing of service delivery to \nthe private sector due to an increasing lack of financial and institutional capacities on the \nside of local government, than on partnerships between communities and government \nstructures\u201d (Kehler, 2000, 7). Even where services are delivered, this does not necessarily \nindicate community participation. As one report points out, \u201cIf communities are not \ninvolved in the decision-making processes surrounding the question of what services \nneed to be delivered services will most likely fail to meet the needs of those whose living \n 31 \nconditions should be improved\u2026\u201d (GAP\/FCR, 1998, 24-5). The discrepancies between \nthe perceptions of local government and black women effectively disempower the latter \nby making them recipients of, and not participants in, development. Dangers of alienation \nare inherent in this. \nStudies have shown that it will be difficult to realise the aims of the IDPs in South \nAfrica. One problem is the lack of capacity of local government, both in terms of funding \nand institutional capacity, required to take on new responsibilities (Friedman, 1997, 463-\n69). Increased decentralisation of functions has not been matched by a corresponding \ndevolution of finance to local government, producing \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d (John, 1997, \n2). Since local governments are required to generate 80% of their budget from their \nconstituents, the problems for impoverished municipalities are obvious. As this study \nsuggests, there is also a lack of community participation in all spheres of IDP and social \ndevelopment based upon a lack of knowledge of IDP and a lack of capacity within local \ncommunities. Furthermore, legislation is not clear enough and leaves too much room for \ninterpretation of what meaningful participation is (Liebenberg, 1999, 6). Thus, while ever \nblack women are excluded from decision-making and other IDP processes, and gender \nindicators are excluded from IDP requirements, community participation as the key \nprinciple in IDP remains \u201crather a statement of intent than reality at the community level\u201d \n(GAP\/FCR, 1998, 25-6).  \nIt is not clear that IDP can deliver what it promises, primarily because the notion \nof citizen participation creates a fundamental anomaly. Citizens\u201f interests are cared for by \nelected representatives and the policies they determine are implemented by bureaucrats \nacting in organisational structures that are the antithesis of democracy. Thus democratic \n 32 \nexpectations are imposed on governmental structures that were never designed to \nfunction democratically (Brynard, 1996, 39-40). Unless black women\u201fs voices are heard \nin IDP processes, their political and economic marginalisation will continue and local \ngovernment will fail to fulfil its developmental role (GAP\/FCR, 1998, 11). When \ncounterpoised against this, the successes of black women\u201fs organisations, in terms of \neffecting access to and control of resources are instructive. Local government might \nfocus less on creating new structures to \u201ebring government to the people\u201f and build on \nstructures already operating successfully within communities. It could also support and \nfacilitate socio-economic development projects that are run by black women and aimed at \nthe provision of sources of income. \nThe close interaction with communities presents opportunities for local \ngovernment to promote gender equity that other spheres of government do not have. \nHowever, understanding which groups benefit most from a particular strategy and which \nare consulted and excluded from local decision-making processes is of importance. This \npaper has demonstrated that poor, black women can only participate in decision-making \nprocesses if they have appropriate information upon which to make informed decisions, \nbut they are often ill-informed about issues that affect their lives directly. They also \nrequire time to attend meetings, and the confidence to speak up and receive respect as \nequal participants in discussions; these conditions are often absent. Local government has \na role to play in devising creative strategies to ensure that these conditions are met. \nIndeed, it has a Constitutional responsibility to promote gender equity. In doing so it can \nbecome an important agent for social change. That women are still underrepresented \nwithin local government structures may only compound the challenges of constructing \n 33 \nequal citizenship through participatory democracy. The maintenance of a stable \ndemocracy in South Africa depends upon the translation of de jure rights into de facto \nequality and the direct empowerment of people from the grassroots level upwards, \nallowing popular and equitable participation of all sections of the population in decision-\nmaking and resource allocation. Clearly, women and poor people have to be thought of \nnot as recipients of citizenship but rather as agents in its construction (Seidman, 1999).  \nProcesses of democratic transformation are still unfolding in South Africa. Only \ntime will tell whether experiences here will point towards workable alternative notions of \ncitizenship, towards locally rooted and participatory democracy that can effect \u201egood \ngovernance\u201f. To do so, the transformation must be successful in the creation of spaces for \nthe participation of even the most marginalised, where emphasis is placed on the abilities \nof people to participate in and mould the policies that shape their everyday lives \n(Staeheli, 1994). As Seidman (1999) argues, if \u201ewomen\u201fs interests\u201f are defined, in part, \nby the spaces through which participation is channelled, the local democracy that is being \nconstructed in South Africa has the potential to offer a new vision of gendered \nparticipatory citizenship. The potential for good local governance, founded on citizen \nparticipation and accountability, exists; the creation of a more equitable society depends \non the fulfilment of this potential. \n \nReferences \nAgenda, 2000.

In this sense, its influence comes from \u201cnot just people but from how their \nvarious interests are exercised through power relations that are in turn shaped by a range \nof facets such as age, gender, political affiliation, history, language, status, etc.\u201d \n(Sihlongonyane, 2001, 42). \n2\n I use the term \u201eblack\u201f as inclusive of all women of colour, whilst being mindful of the \nsensitivities associated with such terminology. \n3\n The distinct demographics (the 1996 census revealed a majority so-called \u201eColoured\u201f \npopulation (50%), a relatively large \u201ewhite\u201f population (22%) and a relatively small \n\u201eAfrican\u201f population (26%)) and politics (Democratic Alliance (DA) has a majority at \nprovincial level and took the City of Cape Town in 1999) of the Cape metropolitan area \nrequire that caution be exercised in any attempts at generalisation. However, this study \nrepresents a detailed analysis of local governance in a specific locality, and raises several \nissues that are of relevance throughout South Africa. \n4\n The constitutional commitment to local government is underpinned by four pieces of \nlegislation. The Municipal Structures Act (2000) demarcates new municipalities (reduced \nfrom 800 to 284) and allows the creation of economies of scale and integrated planning \nwithin municipalities. The Municipal Systems Act (2000) deals with performance \nmeasurement of councillors and municipalities, together with the way in which they deal \nwith the electorate. The Financial Management Bill deals with accountability and \n 39 \n                                                                                                                                                                             \ntransparency of municipalities and the Property Rating Bill allows municipalities to be \ninnovative in the collection of revenue. \n5\n Under apartheid, Cape Town was spatially divided into \u201ewhite\u201f, \u201eColoured\u201f and \n\u201eAfrican\u201f residential areas. Althoughly deeply problematic, these terms are still used. In \nthis context, \u201eAfrican\u201f refers to those townships with predominantly isiXhosa-speaking \npopulations. \n6\n Now part of the Unicity, Khayelitsha is one of the largest African townships in South \nAfrica, with an estimated population of between 500,000 and 1 million people. \n7\n Sites A and C are characterised by two-room houses built by the city council in the \n1980s. Site B is an informal settlement where flush toilets and tarred roads have been \nbuilt as part of the RDP upgrading, but no council housing has been developed. \nCommunity members have built a few formal houses with the assistance of building \nassociations. Harare was established in the early 1990s to accommodate people from a \nnearby squatter settlement, and has a similar infrastructure to that of Site B. \n8\n Initial access to organisations and respondents was facilitated by the Foundation for \nContemporary Research and interviewees were identified through a \u201esnowballing\u201f \nprocess. Interviews were conducted in isiXhosa with the help of a research assistant \nbetween February and April 2001 and translated. Khayelitsha was chosen because it is \nthe poorest of Cape Town\u201fs townships and arguably most in need of development. \n9\n The area was one highlighted for central government funds in President Mbeki\u201fs \naddress to the nation in February 2001. \n 40 \n                                                                                                                                                                             \n10\n Only 25% of respondents were formally employed; 15% were engaged in informal \nemployment. These figures are broadly representative of Khayelitsha (see Dyantyi and \nFrater, 1998). \n11\n General dissatisfaction with service provision in Khayelitsha culminated in a \ntemporary \u201eland invasion\u201f in Mfuleni by those rendered homeless by flooding in June \n1991. \n \n12\n Interview with Mrs ZM, Skills Leader, Langa, 15.2.01. Organisations such as these are \nto be found in most African townships throughout South Africa and are generally \ndominated by women. \n13\n Interview with Ms C, Community Liaison Officer at Makukhanye housing scheme \n(2.4.01). HOSHOP alone has built 350 houses; 90% of the beneficiaries are women. \n14\n Homeless People\u201fs Federation, Development Action Group and Marnol are just three \nof the NGOs involved in capacity-building related to housing developments. \n"}
