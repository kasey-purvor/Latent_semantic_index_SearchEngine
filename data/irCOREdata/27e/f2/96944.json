Introduction \nSeveral models have been proposed to describe cell pattern formation in early \nembryonic development. A large number of these models are based on reaction \ndiffusion systems involving chemicals which, in the appropriate parameter do- \nmain, bifurcate from a homogeneous steady state and evolve into a hetero- \ngeneous teady state (see, for example, [1-3]). This chemical pre-pattern is then \ninterpreted by cells which differentiate accordingly to form a cell pattern [4]. \nRecently, an alternative approach to embryological pattern formation has \nbeen proposed by Murray, Oster and their co-workers [5, 6] based on the \nmechanochemical interaction of cells with their surrounding tissue. Linear analysis \nof such models suggests that they exhibit wide-ranging pattern formation \ncapability [7]. Perelson et al. [8] confirmed this by numerically solving the \nnonlinear system in one dimension to get spatially heterogeneous and spatio- \ntemporally oscillating patterns. Maini and Murray [9] carried out a nonlinear \nanalysis for a simple version of the model to investigate spatial pattern formation. \n508 P.K. Maini \nIn this paper we analyse a more complicated version of the model to \ndetermine possible spatial patterns and spatio-temporally oscillating solutions. In \nSect. 2 we briefly motivate the model equations. In Sect. 3 we investigate the \nlinear stability of the non-trivial steady state and show that it is unstable to \nperturbations in a certain range of wave numbers. In Sect. 4 we investigate the \npossible spatial patterns the model can exhibit. In Sect. 5 we consider periodic \nboundary conditions. Under these conditions the spatially uniform steady state \nloses stability through a Hopf bifurcation and we examine the evolution of such \nspatio-temporally oscillating solutions using the method of multi-time scale \nperturbation (see, for example, [10]). In Sect. 6, we investigate a singular \ndispersion relation that arises in a certain parameter domain for the model. We \nanalyse the subsequent fast-focussing problem and show the possible xistence of \nsmall amplitude spatial pattern. \n2. The model \nIn 1983, Oster et al. [5] proposed a mechanical model for pattern formation \nbased on mesenchymal cells moving through and deforming an extracellular \nmatrix (ECM). In this section webriefly describe a simplified version of the full \nmodel and refer the reader to the original paper for full details. The model is \nbased on the three field variables: \nn(_x, t) = density of mesenchymal cells at position x and time t, \np(_x, t) --- density of ECM at position _x and time t, \nu(_x, t) = displacement a time t of a material point of ECM initially at _x. \nThe model consists of three equations: \nCell conservation. \nOn \n- -~-  - -V ' J  \nOt \nwhere _J is a flux term. Several cell processes contribute to this term. We shall \nfocus on three in particular, namely, diffusion, convection and haptotaxis. \nThe diffusive flux is of Fickian type, \nJ~D = - D Vn \nwhere D is the positive diffusion coefficient. \nThe convective flux is due to cells riding passively on the ECM and may be \nmodeled by \n0u \nJ c~n --~ . \n- c3t \nCells move by attaching their filopodia to specialized adhesive sites in the ECM \nand move up a gradient in adhesive site density. This process is called haptotaxis. \nCel l -hapotax is  mode l  509 \nAssuming that adhesive site density is proportional to ECM density, the hapto- \ntactic flux may be modeled by \n-']H = an Vp, \nwhere a is the positive haptotactic coefficient. Thus the cell conservation equation \nis \n~t=DV~n-~V.(nVp)-V. n , (2.1) \nwhere we have assumed D and a to be constants for simplicity. \nMatrix conservation. Assuming that at the stage of pattern formation the cells \nhave stopped secreting matrix the matrix equation is \n&+V.  p =0, (2.2) \nwhere we assume that matrix moves only by convection. \nMechanical force balance. We are in the regime of low Reynolds number so \nviscoelastic forces dominate inertial terms and cell motion instantly ceases when \nthe applied forces switch off. Therefore, the mechanical force balance quation is \nV \f9 a_ +pF_=O, \nwhere _o- is the stress tensor and F the body force. Modeling the cell-matrix \ncomposite as a linear, isotropic, viscoelastic material, the stress tensor may be \nwritten as \nwhere \nO\" ~ _O'matrix \"-[- O'cell_matrix, \nc\u2022e_ ~0 E \n-- matrix = + U2 + v*Oi  \nviscous elastic \nO = V.u,  the dilation, _e =\u000189 + Vur], the linear strain tensor (superscript T\ndenotes the transpose), Pl and\/~2 are the shear and bulk viscosities respectively, \nv the Poisson ratio, v* = 1\/(1 -2v),  and I is the unit tensor. The stress exerted by \nthe contractile forces of the cells on the matrix is assumed to be of the form \nO'cell.matrix = ,npl \nwhere ,  is the positive traction coefficient. Assuming that the cell-matrix com- \nposite is subject to a linear restoring force, F = -s_u, where s is a positive \nconstant. Thus the mechanical balance equation is \nI 801{  E } 1 V\" #1~+\/~20t  + ~ (g+v*Ol)+znpl =sup. (2.3) \nEquations (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) are simplified versions of the model presented in \n510 P.K. Maini \n[5]. The system may be non-dimensionalized and, with appropriate non-dimen- \nsionalization (see Appendix A.I), the one-dimensional version of the model is \nt3n 0 (nC3U'~ OZn 0 (~x)  \nOt+~xx\\  ~3t]=D-~x2--O~x n , (2.4a) \na3u O2u ~x # ~ + ~x 2 + T (np)= sup, (2.4b) \n3t+~xx p~-~ =0,  (2.4c) \nwhere x is now the one-dimensional spatial coordinate and u(x, t) the displace- \nment of a material point initially at x, # = #~ +\/~2, and n = p = 1, # = 0 is the \nbiologically relevant steady state. In this paper we shall restrict our attention to \nthe one-dimensional case. \nWe simplify the system further by linearising (2.4c) about the steady state \nand integrating, to give \np~l - - -  \nSubstituting (2.5) into (2.4a, b) gives \n~u \nOx\" (2.5) \nOn a { Ou\\ OZn O I ~ t32u'~ \nOt+-~x~n~)=D-~x2+~x~n-~x2) ,  (2.6a) \na3u a2u 0 - n yx \n# + Tx ,, = su 1 au \nwith the condition \n0u \n- -  < 1. (2.6c) \nOx \nNote that the condition (2.6c) is forced by (2.5) since p cannot be negative. This \nassumption is consistent with the derivation of the model equations which was \nwas based on a small strain approximation. The pair of equations (2.6a, b) is the \nversion of the model that we will study. We shall discuss boundary conditions in \nSection 4. \n3. Linear stability analysis \nThe pair of Eqs. (2.6a, b) has the non-trivial steady state n = 1, u = 0. We wish \nto analyse the linear stability of this uniform steady state to small spatial \nperturbations. For smooth initial data the solution to the linearised problem may \nbe written as the integral of functions of the form e '~`+ikx over k, where a(k) is \nthe temporal growth rate of the Fourier component of the initial perturbation \nwhich has wave number k. To analyse the temporal growth of these Fourier \nCell-hapotaxis model 511 \ncomponents (see, for example, [11]) we look for solutions of  the form \nto the linearised system and we obtain the dispersion relation \nl~k2a2(k 2) + b(k2)a(k 2) + c(k 2) = 0, \nwhere \nb(k 2) = #Dk 4 4- ( 1 - 2z)k 2 + s, \n(3.2) \nc(k 2) = {D - (D 4- ~)z}k 4 4- sDk 2. \nThe steady state n = 1, u = 0 will be unstable if there exists a wave number k \nsuch that Rl(a(k2)) is greater than zero, that is, the linearized system will extract \nthe k wave nmrtber from the Fourier decomposit ion of  the initial perturbation \nand cause it to grow. It is easy to show that if D > (D + a)z then the uniform \nsteady state loses stability as z increases beyond a critical value, %, where \n1 zc > ~ and (2% - -  1 )  2 ---- 41~Ds.

Steady state analysis \nIn Sect. 3 we showed that the non-trivial uniform steady state of  the model \nsystem (2.6a, b) lost stability through a Hopf  bifurcation and therefore we would \nexpect the system to exhibit spatio-temporal oscillations. However, if we now \nconsider solving the system on the finite domain [0, 1] and impose the boundary \nconditions \nOn t~2u \n#x u ~ O, (4.1) \nRIo' \n~_ k 2 \n~ . ~  increasing \nFig. 1.

Maini \nat x = 0 and x = 1, then travelling wave type solutions are not permissible and \nthe only types of heterogeneous solutions we would expect are purely spatial pattern \nor a temporally 'sloshing' pattern that satisfies (4.1) at the boundary but has \ntemporal variation in the interior of the domain. In this section we restrict our \nattention to purely spatial pattern. Then, instability will arise only if a disturbance \nwith wave number that satisfies the boundary conditions (4.1) has a temporal \ngrowth that is purely real and positive. The system may then evolve into a spatially \nheterogeneous steady state. Clearly, from the form of the dispersion relation (3.2) \nsuch a situation is possible. The steady state problem for (2.6a, b) is \nd2n d(  d2u'~ \nD~x2 +a--~x n dx2]=O, (4.2a) \ndx---5+~-~x n-n--~x -su 1 dx] (4.2b) \nwith boundary conditions (4.1) where, now, n = n(x) and u = u(x).

Clearly, if the \ntrajectory is traversed m times we get m humps for the cell density n(x). These \nsolutions are similar to those computed numerically in [8] for the time dependent \nproblem for a more generalized system than the one we are studying here. \n5. Spatio-temporai oscillations \nIf we do not impose boundary conditions (4.1) but instead impose periodic \nboundary conditions on [0, 1], then the linear analysis of Sect. 3 shows that the \nuniform steady state loses stability and may evolve to a travelling wave type \nsolution. In this section we examine the time evolution of such a spatio-temporal \noscillating instability using a multi-time scale perturbation procedure. \nFrom Sect. 3, the uniform steady state loses linear stability as the cell traction \nparameter T increases past a critical value zc given by (3.3a) to disturbances of \nwave number kc given by (3.3b). We shall assume that this disturbance satisfies \nthe periodic boundary conditions. Clearly, we can choose\/t and D such that this \nis true. If we let \n\"C-~-~c-'[-E2(~, O<c, ,~l  and 6=+1,  (5.1) \n\u2022 \nP \nI \n0 1 \nFig. 3. Steady state corresponding to the phase trajectory from A to A in Fig. 2. Note that if the \ntrajectory went from A to A'  we would simply have a gradient solution for n, whereas if the trajectory \nA to A is traversed m times we get a solution for n(x) with m humps. These solutions are similar to \nthose computed in [8] for the time evolution problem for a more complicated version of the model \n514 P.K.  Maini \nthen the expression exp{at + ikc x} becomes \nexp{E2t + i(att + kcx)} where a, = +__\/(D - (D + ~)%)k~ + sD (5.2) \nWe shall examine only the case where at is the positive solution in (5.2), that is, \nwe look only for wave type solutions travelling in one direction. This suggests the \nchange of coordinates \nffl 0\"1 T=e2,, z=x+~t ,  O,~ezOr+~Oz, Ox--*Oz, (5.3) \nwhere T is a slow time scale and z varies with x and t.

We expand n and u in the form \nn(z, T, Q = 1 + enl (z, T) + s , T) +- . . ,  (5.5a) \nu(z, T, E) = eu I(zl, T) + EZu2(z, T) +\" \" ' ,  (5.5b) \nand substitute into (5.4a, b) and equate coefficients of E. At order c, we may write \nnl(z, T) = al(T) exp(ikcz) + bl(T) exp(-ikcz), (5.6a) \nUl (z, T) = Cl (T) exp(ik~z) + d~ (T) exp( - ik~z), (5.6b) \nwhere c~(T) and d~(T) depend on a~ (T) and bl(T). That is, we assume that the \nonly mode that grows on the long time scale T is that with wave number k~ and \nthat the solution is periodic in z, period 2n\/k~. Secular terms appear at order E 3. \nIf we denote by ~(n, u) the linearised operator from (5.4a, b) and by g_ = g2 \nthe secular terms that appear at O(e3), then a solution exists if and only if the \nFredholm alternative (see [12], for example) is satisfied, that is \n~0 2r~\/kc \n(_n*, g~ = (n*~l q- u*g2) dz = O, (5.7) \nwhere the bar denotes the complex conjugate and n*= is the solution of \n-- U*  \n~*(n*, u*) = 0 where ~r is the adjoint operator to ~(n, u).

This also makes dl (T) = cl (T) ensur- \ning that u is real, too. With this substitution, R = 15 and S = Q in (5.8). If we \nmultiply (5.8a) by t~l and (5.8b) by al and add the resulting equations we find the \nevolution equation for lal[2: \na [2 d---T [al = 6( 2Rf  P) [a~ [ 2 + 2Rg'Q ]al [4 (5.9) \nwhere P and Q are given in Appendix A.2. \nWe summarize the behaviour of (5.9) in Table 1.

Singular dispersion relation \nIn [7] it was shown that in various parameter spaces the general model of Oster \net al. exhibited a singular dispersion relation when linearised about the uniform \nnon-zero steady state. That is, the initial growth rate of a disturbance of wave \nnumber k tended to positive or negative infinity as k tended to some critical wave \nnumber. Britton [13] analysed a singular dispersion relation arising in a one \nequation caricature of the original model. In this section we analyse one of the \nactual models discussed in [5] that has a singular dispersion relation. If we set \n# = 0 in (2.6b), that is, if we assume that the ECM behaves as a purely elastic \nmedium and that the elastic restoring forces generated by the ECM are in \nmechanical balance with cell traction, then the model system reduces to \n0n a (OU)  t~2n 0 \/ O2U~ \nOt +-~x n-~ = D ~Sx2 + =-~x ~n-~x2) , (6.1a) \n( 02u c~ ~u - 7x c?x2+Z~xn-n-~x =su 1 , (6.1b) \nwith boundary conditions \n0n 02u \n-u -  -0  a tx=0,1 .

The \nbehaviour of  o(k 2) as a varies is sketched in Fig. 5. \nWe shall assume that there is one and only one wave number k that satisfies \n(6.1c) and has positive temporal growth rate. Furthermore, we assume that \nk = kc. \nIn Sect. 5, the linear growth rate was small, so we looked for solutions that \nevolved on the slow time scale ~2t. In this case, the linear growth rate is very large \nand suggests a fast-focussing effect. Thus we should look for solutions that \nevolve on the fast time scale tiE. Therefore we set \n~c=D,  ~=~-& where0<e~l ,  &=_ l ,  and T=t \/e .  (6.4) \nWe ignore variation on the normal time scale t, therefore n, u are functions of  \nx, T, E and on substituting (6.4) into (6.1a, b) we obtain \nOn a n =e LD + E 2& (6.5a) a~+~x n - n , \n( ) au -gx aau # -n~xx  &x - -5  + ~ ~x n = su I (6.5b) \nWe expand n and u in the form \nn(x, T, e) = 1 +end(x, T)  + e2nz(x, T)  +\" ' ,  (6.6a) \nu(x, T, e) = Eul (x, T)  + e2u2(x, T) + ' .  \", (6.6b) \nand substitute into (6.5a, b) and equate coefficients of  e. \nThe order E terms give \nanl ~_~T (aUl~ aT  + \\ ax } = 0, (6.7a) \n(~2u I 0n 1 \n( 1 -- z) ~x  z - su, + \f9 ~-x = 0.

Maini \nWe can integrate (6.7a) with respect o T to get \n+ Oul = F(x), nl ~x (6.7c) \nwhere F(x) is an arbitrary function of x. The solution to (6.7b, c) with boundary \nconditions (6.1c) is \nnl = al (T) cos kcx + np(x), (6.8a) \nul = bl ( T) sin kcx + up(x), where al = -kcbl ,  (6.8b) \nand (n~, u l )=  (np, up) is a particular solution to (6.7c) satisfying (6.1c). Our \nasymptotic procedure assumes that on the T time scale the system has isolated \nthe spatial disturbance of wave number kc and that this is the only spatial \ndependence of the solution (see, for example [14]). Thus, in order to be \nconsistent, we must take np(x) -Up(X) -O. This forces F(x)= O. \nAt O(e 2) a secular term appears in the first equation of the form \n(~ 2\/'\/1 03\/,\/1 \nD-~x2 + CCc 8x 3 \f9 \nHowever, because of the special choice of kc this term is identically zero. Secular \nterms appear at O(e 3) and may be suppressed as described in Sect. 4.

Discussion \nWe have analysed a cell-haptotaxis model and have shown that it may exhibit \nspatial and spatio-temporal patterns. The solutions obtained from the nonlinear \nanalyses are similar to those computed numerically in [8]. The spatial patterns are \nsimilar to those obtained by Grindrod et al. [15], for a cell-chemotaxis model. \nHowever, the model analysed here can give rise to spatio-temporal oscillations, too. \nThis type of behaviour has been exploited by Goldwasser et al. [16], to show how \ntemporal oscillations may account for certain cell splitting and branching \nphenomena. The full analysis of the spatio-temporal case is a formidable task and \nwe have made several simplifying assumptions in Sect. 5. We have assumed that the \nwave moves only in one direction, that is, we have ignored the negative solution \nfor a t in (5.2). Including this root would lead to waves travelling in opposite \ndirections and thus there would be two pairs of amplitude quations and the \npossibility of standing waves. Thus the validity of our analysis is restricted to \nsituations in which a direction is specified. Biologically, this may correspond to a \ncase where cells are introduced at one end of a domain and propagate through it. \nThe second major assumption is that we look at monochromatic waves, that \nis, waves of one wave length in space. More generally, this type of propagating wave \nproblem should consider the motion of a wave packet. The interaction of several \nspatially varying perturbations suggests a slowly varying spatial coordinate (see, \nfor example, [17]) and calculation of a group velocity. However, the complex form \nof the equations and the dispersion relation in this problem makes uch an analysis \nformidable algebraically and here we have examined the time evolution of a \nparticular periodic pattern. We intend to analyse a simpler version of the general \nmodel [5] to extend the analysis presented in Sect. 5 and to address the above points \nmore fully. \n520 P.K.  Maini \nWe also presented a formal analysis for the case of a singular dispersion \nrelation and showed that, in the appropriate parameter space, the system could \nevolve to a small amplitude spatially heterogeneous steady state. \nIn all the above analyses, we delimited parameter regimes wherein certain \nphenomena will occur. Although all the parameters are in principle measureable \nexperimentally, it is difficult to obtain accurate measurements. An advantage of \nnon-dimensionalising the system is that we deal with parameter groupings and it \nis easier to compare, quantitatively, relative sizes of parameters. For example the \nanalysis in Sect. 3 shows that pattern formation occurs if the non-dimensional \ncell traction parameter increases beyond a critical value, and (6.11) shows that \nfast-focussing is possible for very large cell traction. Cell traction has been \nmeasured for mesenchymal cells in vitro [18] and such cells can exert very large \ntraction [19]. It is also known that cell traction in vitro increases abruptly over \nthe first few days in culture (Harris, personal communication). Such behaviour \nreinforces the possibility of cell traction playing the role of the bifurcation \nparameter. Of course, this can be said only of the in vitro case and more \nexperimental work is necessary before one can extend this to the in vivo situation. \nAppend ix  \nA.1. Equations (2.1), (2.2) and (2.3) may be non-dimensionalised as follows: let \nL and To be typical ength and time scales respectively, N be average cell density \nand Po be average xtracellular matrix density. \nWe define non-dimensional (tilde) variables as \n~ x n p _x =--- ~ =~ \nL '  ' P=- - '  Po \nt \n7=- -  \n~o' \nj oDTo  \nL 2 ' \nSpo( 1 + v)L 2 (Xpo Z 0 \ns -  E , 8 -  L2 , \n(1 + v)#2 ~Np0(1 + v) \n\/72 -  , ? -  \nETo E \n_u \n- Z '  \n(1 + v)#l \nET0 \nwhere \nP, = kc {(3D + ~)kcV + i (2V 2 - Dka(D + e))}, \nP2 = -2pOk~ V + ikc(#DZk~ + (c~ - D)% - #V2), \nQ, = Q1,Q~3{-2V%k~ + i(D + e)k 3 } + 2kZzQ,2{ZV - i(2~ + D)kc} \n+ ikcsQ13(v - iDkc) , \nPt \nQ2-  V -  i~k, ' \nThis non-dimensionalisation transforms the one-dimensional version of (2.1), \n(2.2) and (2.3) into equations (2.4), where we have dropped the tildes for \nnotational convenience. \nA.2, In Eq.
