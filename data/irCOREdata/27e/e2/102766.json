In 1987, one year after the beginning of doi moi, the state issued the \nLaw on Foreign Investment, which encouraged foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam, \nespecially in the tourism industry. This paper examines the influence of the resulting influx of \nforeign direct investment on tourism accommodation patterns in Vietnam. A synopsis of policy \nand background of FDI in Vietnam accommodation is followed by an examination of \ndevelopments, projects and experiences in this field since doi moi. The paper then investigates \nthe effects of FDI in Vietnam tourism accommodation on developments and practices in \nVietnam\u2019s accommodation market, including the traditional state-owned accommodation sub-\nsector. The paper integrates insights gained from interviews with operators of joint-venture and \nstate-owned hotels in Vietnam. \n \nKeywords: foreign direct investment, doi moi, tourism accommodation, tourism management, \nVietnam. \n \n 2\nVietnam\u2019s Open Door Policy \n \nDoi Moi \n \nIn 1986, the Congress of Vietnam introduced an economic programme called doi moi \n(Renovation), which has been compared to Gorbachev\u2019s contemporaneous glasnost campaign in \nthe Soviet Union. The Vietnamese Communist Party\u2019s new policy called for measures including \nthe decentralisation of the planning system, a decrease in the number of government ministries \nand bureaucracies, reliance on the private sector as an engine of economic growth, and allowing \nstate and privately-owned industries to trade directly in foreign and international markets. Doi \nmoi has succeeded remarkably in moving the country from a stagnant, centrally planned Soviet-\nstyle economy with macroeconomic instability to a socialist-oriented mixed market-oriented \neconomy characterised by rapid growth (Kokko, 1998: 2). Developments such as the end of the \nUS trade embargo on Vietnam in 1994, Vietnam\u2019s 1995 entry into ASEAN, and Vietnam\u2019s \nadmission to the WTO in 2007 indicate an increasing re-integration of Vietnam into international \nmarkets. \n \nDoi Moi and Tourism \n \nWith these political and economic shifts, Vietnam has become a much more accessible and \nattractive destination in the international tourism market and has been rediscovered by tourists \nfrom around the world. Consequently, Vietnam\u2019s tourism industry has experienced a period of \n 3\nmeteoric growth in recent years. Over 4.1 million international tourists arrived in Vietnam in \n2007, an increase of over ten-fold since 1990 (www.vietnamtourism.com\/e_pages\/news\/ \nindex.asp?loai=2&uid=6751).  Tourism accommodation and travel agencies in Vietnam earned a \ntotal of 10,743.5 billion dong (USD 670 million) in 2004, compared to 4,458.5 billion dong \n(USD 280 million) in 2000 (www.gso.gov.vn). It has been predicted that earnings from foreign \nvisitors to Vietnam in 2010 will reach USD 11.8 billion (Sadi and Henderson, 2001: 70). As of \n2006, an estimated 234,000 people worked in Vietnam\u2019s tourism sector, with another 510,000 \njobs in related industries (John, 2006). Aside from this quantifiable growth, tourism in Vietnam \nhas also changed in character during the years since 1986. Vietnam\u2019s tourism industry is \nexperiencing the emergence of new tourism niches, new kinds of attractions and businesses, new \nbreeds of tourists and unfamiliar types of tourism such as eco-tourism and war tourism. Far from \nbeing merely a side-effect of economic and political changes in Vietnam, growth and change in \nthe tourism sector has also generated effects that have an influence on politics, economics and \nVietnamese society in general.  \n \nThe current Socio-Economic Strategy of Vietnam for the years 2001-2010 continues the doi moi \nprogramme and sets out goals for the further improvement of the country in all its facets. This \npaper discusses the development of foreign direct investment in the accommodation sector in the \ncontext of doi moi as an ongoing process. It contains insights gained through interviews with \nvarious figures of responsibility in government and the tourism industry, both public and private, \nwho have experienced the development of FDI in within Vietnam\u2019s evolving transition economy. \n \n \n 4\nMethodology \n \nChallenges and Limitations \n \nResearch in Vietnam is still associated with certain problems, and there is relatively little \npublished research on tourism in Vietnam. The English language literature on this subject is very \nlimited. The authors also found that most government organisations are either not willing to \nshare information and documents, or that the statistics in question do not exist or were never \nrecorded (Henderson, 2000; Lloyd et al, 2004). \n \nMany researchers and scholars have referred to this lack of reliable and accurate basic statistical \ninformation data for Vietnam, and in addition, the country lacks continuous historical data on the \ndevelopment of tourism (Lloyd, 2004; Lloyd et al, 2004; Mok and Lam, 1998; EIU, 1993; \nHenderson, 2000; Theuns, 1997). Insufficient standardisation or coordination of measuring \nperiods and time spans from province to province or from year to year, inadequate training, \nresources and interdepartmental coordination are all likely contribute to this problem, as does \nincreasing forgery, smuggling and falsification of documents to meet a growing demand by \nresearchers and organisations for data that may not exist in the form required (Lloyd et al, 2004). \nIt has been said that the open door policy has seemingly brought Vietnam\u2019s communist \ngovernment to realise the need to improve the reliability and availability of data in order to \nattract potential foreign investors who need trustworthy and consistent statistics as a basis for \ntheir development strategies (EIU, 1993; Mok and Lam, 1998). The Statistical Office in Ho Chi \nMinh City plans to undertake a greater number of surveys and research in tourism and publish a \n 5\ngreater variety of tourism statistics in their yearbooks (Interview with Director of Statistics \nOffice, Ho Chi Minh City).  \n \nThis study investigates changes in tourism that occurred during the first years of the twenty first \ncentury. However, some of the data referenced in this paper comes from the period between the \nbeginning of doi moi and the turn of the century, in order to provide a context for the \ndevelopments that led in to this situation. Political and financial events of recent years make it \ndifficult to extrapolate the trends identified in this paper into subsequent years or the future. \n \nChoice of Methods \n \nThe use of key interviews was chosen as the principal method of gathering data for this paper, \nand the research combines a series of interviews conducted by the lead author with \nadministrative figures in two international hotel chains, seven state owned hotels and three \nguesthouses at different locations in Vietnam. These were supplemented with interviews with a \nsenior expert in hotels from the Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) and a \nsenior official of the Foreign Investment Agency, Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \nDesk research from secondary sources including government documents, newspapers and \nperiodicals supplemented the information gathered from the interviews. \n \nFirms, organisations and individuals that have been active in Vietnam tourism from before doi \nmoi were primarily sought out for interviews, in order to get insight into patterns over a longer \nperiod of time, even before the beginning of doi moi. Because of the government monopoly on \n 6\ntourism businesses before 1986, state-owned hotels and firms in Vietnam tended to be the \nlongest-established and thus were specially targeted for interviews. Interviewees were also \nchosen from foreign firms, FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and other private enterprises that \nhave been operating in Vietnam since at least the beginning of the development of private and \nFDI enterprises in Vietnam tourism as part of doi moi. To gain an understanding of tourism \npolicy changes from the vantage point of the makers and enforcers of this policy, interviews \nwere also conducted with representatives of government bodies. \n \nA semi-structured interview form was used, involving the implementation of a number of pre-\ndetermined questions and\/or special topics, asked of each interviewee in a consistent and \nsystematic order, but allowing the interviewer sufficient freedom to digress in order to probe \nbeyond the immediate answers to the predetermined questions. New issues often arose during an \ninterview, which led the interviewer to ask additional questions to probe a certain direction.  \nSuch questions varied among interviewees. One examples of this is a line of questioning \nregarding hotel room prices that revealed patterns in changes of accommodation development, \nsupply and demand since the beginning of doi moi. \n \nMultiple lines of questioning of different interviewees at different levels or sectors were used to \nvalidate and cross-check interview results, such as the interviewing of private, state-owned and \ninternational operators as well as representatives of the VNAT regarding the development of the \naccommodation sector. Representatives of government bodies were often in a position to verify \nthe results of interviews with representatives of tourism businesses and data from other primary \nsources. \n 7\n \nContribution  \n \nA 2004 survey of representatives of the investment promotion agencies of more than 50 nations \n(most of them developing countries) determined that tourism is one of the main industries being \ntargeted by these countries for FDI (Endo, 2006: 601). While dealing specifically with Vietnam, \nthis paper contributes to knowledge on investment in the developing world in general, and \nsocialist countries in particular. It offers specific insights into the ways in which the introduction \nof aspects of a free market economy into a socialist system affects the risks and opportunities for \ninvestment. Through the use of elite interviews, the research gives an understanding of how such \na broad macro-economic transition affects, and is affected by, individual tourism operators. It \ngoes beyond the discussion of the purely economic and political aspects of the investment \nclimate within political transition to reveal the workings of mechanisms of knowledge transfer \nand cultural negotiation between public and private, domestic and foreign, established and start-\nup interests in this context. \n \nFDI\/Joint Ventures in Vietnam \n \nLegal Framework \n \nIn 1987, a new foreign investment law was inaugurated, encouraging foreign investment by \noffering enticing conditions for joint enterprises and foreign-owned corporations.  The Law on \nForeign Investment opened the Vietnamese market to investment by foreign firms and persons \nand guaranteed them rights of ownership and fair treatment including freedom from \n 8\nexpropriation and nationalization of assets. In order to encourage opportunities for transfer of \ncapital and expertise, the law favours joint ventures over the other models of foreign investment \n(Ngo Ba Thanh, 1993: 95).  The duration of foreign investment in a project was originally \nlimited to 20 years.  \n \nA June 30, 1990 amendment to the 1987 Law made it possible for private joint-stock limited \nliability organizations to enter into joint ventures with foreign firms for the first time. This \nprovision was extended by a second amendment on December 23, 1992 to include private \ncompanies. This same amendment also extended the maximum allowable duration of operation \nof foreign-funded firms in Vietnam to 70 years. Vietnamese partners are allowed to contribute \nonly 25 to 30 per cent of the capital for such projects, with a provision for a gradual increase in \ncapital share over time (Le Van Sang, 1995: 121). Other amendments followed in 1996, 2000 \nand 2003. According to a Senior Official of the Foreign Investment Agency (FIA) of the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI), in 1996 the Foreign Investment Agency carried out \nits first study and SWOT analysis comparing Vietnam\u2019s investment law to other countries in an \neffort to learn how Vietnam could attract more FDI. Before this, no need was seen for surveys or \nresearch. \n \nForeign investment is allowed in all economic sectors but specifically encouraged in several \nspecific niches, among them \u2018foreign exchange earning services\u2019 such as ship repair, air- and \nseaport services and tourism (Theuns, 1997: 312). In the original version of the Law, foreign \nfirms were to be liable to pay tax on their profits at a rate of between five and ten per cent, \nthough tax exemption could be granted in special cases to encourage investment (Law on \n 9\nForeign Investment, 1987: Article 33). The only areas from which foreign investment was \nexplicitly excluded by the Law on Foreign Investment were those related to national security \n(Wayne and Lejeune, 1996: 203). \n \nEarly Development of FDI \n \nIn the period 1987 to 1995, foreign investment in Vietnam totaled USD 20.63 billion. By 1996, \nFDI in Vietnam was the second highest of any country in the world, as a percentage of GDP \n(Freeman, 2002: 5). According to Vasavakul, in the mid 1990s tourism was the most popular \nsector for foreign investment, accounting for over USD 3.3 billion. (1997: 348). Investors from \n64 nations, invested in Vietnam up to the end of 2003. Most foreign investment came from Asian \ncountries (Leproux and Brooks, 2004: 2). \n \nHowever, in 1996, FDI declined for the first time since doi moi was adopted, and economic \ngrowth dropped to 4 per cent. Analysts have commented that some aspects of the Renovation \nProgram are nothing more than empty rhetoric on the part of the government, and foreign \ninvestors may have come to the realization that the country\u2019s political climate may not have been \nas open as was originally assumed as shown, by the 1996 campaign to abolish \u2018social evils\u2019 \nwhich called for the prohibition of signs in foreign languages (Batha, 2000). Many internal \nfactors may also have contributed to Vietnam\u2019s economic downturn, such as an excess of \nbureaucracy, which discouraged investment, a complicated and opaque system of rules and \nregulations, widespread corruption in the government and banking systems and favouritism for \nthousands of dysfunctional State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) (Thayer, 2000). The downturn in \n 10\nFDI was exacerbated by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The most fundamental obstacle for \nforeign investors was the Hanoi government itself (Hines, 2000), which had introduced doi moi \nin 1986 \u201cnot out of altruism, but because its hand was forced\u201d (Mitton, 1998). The VCP has been \naccused of having taken two steps forward and one step back (ibid).  \n \nEncouraging FDI \n \nIn order to encourage investors from countries from outside the region, in 1998 the Agency \ncarried out a promotion campaign in European countries for investment in Vietnam (Interview, \nA, 2004). A 1999 ruling allowed foreign investors to own a stake of up to 30 per cent in so-\ncalled \u2018equitized\u2019 state-owned enterprises in several sectors, including hotels (The Saigon Times \nDaily, 1999). In 2005, there was more than USD 2 billion of foreign direct investment in \nVietnam, or 4 per cent of Vietnam\u2019s GDP (ADB, 2006: 8). \n \nEncouraging FDI is a central concern behind market-oriented policy reforms in Vietnam. FDI is \nseen as a catalyst for economic transition and revitalization of the private economic sector (ADB, \n2006: 10). Yasheng (2001, cited in Freeman, 2002: 8) pointed out that FDI has served as a sort of \n\u201cersatz private sector\u201d in China, which, like Vietnam, has a transitional economy, associated \nwith a low-level of domestic private economic development and a sluggish public sector. \nVietnam\u2019s bountiful natural resources and low labor rates, as well as the relatively high \neducation level and pronounced work ethic of the Vietnamese people, contribute to the \nattractiveness of the country for foreign investors (Freeman, 2002: 4). However, encouraging \nforeign investment in Vietnam proved difficult because of a lack of technological capability and \n 11\nmanagerial experience in the country. The infrastructure, destroyed during the War, was in a \nsorry state. The press criticized the administration for having difficulty in abandoning the \n\u2018guerrilla mentality\u2019 and making the transition from a wartime to a peacetime society (Duiker, \n1995: 145). Growth in the private sector and foreign direct investment (FDI) were concentrated \nmainly in the South, where better infrastructure, longer personal and business relations with \nVietnamese and Chinese abroad, and a supportive local administration created a more favorable \nenvironment than in the North (Dodsworth, et al, 1996: 16). Despite improvements in its \ninvestment climate, Vietnam remains less investor-friendly than other countries in Southeast \nAsia, and Vietnam is still not regarded as an economically progressive environment. In 1995, the \ncountry ranked 98th out of 100 rated nations in terms of economic freedom. By 2005, it had only \nprogressed to 142nd out of 157. FDI in Vietnam also still tends to concentrate on the principal \ncities, in part because transport, infrastructure and administrative services are much less \ndeveloped in the rest of the country (ADB, 2006: 34, 46). For example, between 1988 and 2003, \n19 per cent of FDI in Vietnam was in Hanoi and 26 per cent in Ho Chi Minh City (Leproux and \nBrooks, 2004: 2). Vietnam\u2019s great success in attracting FDI in spite of these hindrances attests to \nthe high prospective gains to be made in the country or the value of establishing oneself early \nwithin an emerging market, for which firms are apparently currently willing to accept a high \nlevel of risk and constraints, at least for the present. \n \nContribution of FDI \n \nRetrospective assessments of the significance of the contribution of FDI to the Vietnamese \neconomy vary, according to which indicator is cited. At the end of the 1990s, foreign direct \n 12\ninvestment companies accounted for 13 per cent of Vietnam\u2019s GDP, 27 per cent of its non-oil \nexports, 35 per cent of industrial production and one-quarter of tax revenues. In the year 2000, \nthe total revenues from FDI in Vietnam were USD 6.5 billion and tax income from FDIs was \nUSD 280 million (Freeman, 2002: 3). However, the FDI sector accounted for only a small \nproportion of total employment in the country: 2 per cent in 2000 and 0.6 per cent overall \nbetween 1991 and 2000 (Leproux and Brooks, 2004: 12). In 2001, the World Bank estimated that \naverage total investment in Vietnam would have to attain a level of 30 percent of the GDP by \n2010 (5 percent higher than in the 1990s). A government reform program aims at reducing state \nsector investment to encourage investment from the private sector (Tenev, et al., 2003: 1-2). \nPreliminary figures from the General Statistics Office of Vietnam for 2007 show that foreign \ndirect investment capital accounts for about 129 trillion dong, or about 24.8 percent of total \ninvestment capital in the country. This is an increase of 193 percent from the 2006 FDI amount \n(http:\/\/www.gso.gov.vn\/default_en.aspx?tabid=471&idmid=3). \n \nThe Foreign Investment Law allows for foreign investment in Vietnam in the form of a business \ncorporate contract (BCC), a joint venture or fully foreign-invested properties. In 1998, it was \nnoted that most foreign investors still preferred to have Vietnamese partners who are familiar \nwith the Vietnamese way of doing things (Li, et al, 1998). However, six years later, foreign \ninvestors had gained enough experience in Vietnam to feel confident enough to avoid the \ncomplications of domestic partners by increasingly deciding for 100 per cent ownership of their \nprojects. \n \nFDI in tourism in Vietnam \n \n 13\nTwenty per cent of the USD 30 billion of FDI pledged to Vietnam between 1988 and 1997 was \ndesignated for tourism (Sadi and Henderson, 2001: 71). FDI in tourism in Vietnam grew from \nUSD 7.4 million (2 per cent of total FDI) in 1988 to USD 1.9 billion (30.7 per cent of total FDI) \nin 1995, increasing by around 100 per cent yearly. The number of projects remained more or less \nconstant, but the average size of projects undertaken grew steadily from year to year, from USD \n1.4 million in 1988 to USD 66.7 million in 1995. An increase in the average duration of tourism \nFDI projects from 9 years to 27 years over the same period reflects the growth in the size of \nprojects undertaken and also indicates an increase in investor confidence in the Vietnam tourism \nmarket. Accounting for USD 1.3 billion in funds, Taiwan was by far the largest source of the \ninvestment in Vietnamese tourism in the eight years from 1988 to 1995 (Erramilli, et al, 1997: \n277-278). \n \nThe decline in FDI in Vietnam from 1996 has been especially pronounced in the hospitality and \ntourism sectors, where slow return on investment, complicated procedures and the communist \ngovernment\u2019s \u201cculture of secrecy\u201d have served to disillusion many foreign investors (Sadi and \nHenderson, 2001: 78-80). To this day, a number of barriers and pitfalls for foreign direct \ninvestment still exist in Vietnam. Besides the general hurdles to FDI already discussed in this \npaper, tourism projects are especially dependent on infrastructure, and tend to suffer from \nlagging infrastructure improvements, such as the promised but not-yet-built international airport \non Phu Quoc Island, on which the future tourism development potential of the island will rely. \nThe lack of trustworthy market figures for Vietnam and continuing prevalence of opaque, \ninefficient and corrupt bureaucracy are further complications and sources of discouragement \n(Sadi and Henderson, 2001: 78-80). \n 14\n \nSome FDI-invested sites, such as Phu Quoc Island, which developers plan to turn into a world-\nclass ecotourism destination, are eligible to apply for the highest preferential policies allowed by \nthe Vietnamese government (http:\/\/investphuquoc.com\/investment.html) including expediting \nlicense procedures and establishing a Phu Quoc Investment and Development Management \nBoard to assist investors (http:\/\/english.vietnamnet.vn\/biz\/2008\/08\/800352\/). Some of the \ntwenty-one projects on the island with a total revenue of USD 1.72 billion are already \ncontributing to a 16 percent annual economic growth rate on the island for the past three years \n(http:\/\/www.vietnamtourism.gov.vn).  \n \nFDI \/ Joint Ventures in the Tourism Accommodation Sector \n \nOverview \n \nHoping to encourage tourism to the country, the Vietnamese government declared 1990 \u201cVisit \nVietnam Year\u201d. This ambitious program is considered by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) \n(1993) to have failed due to a shortage of hotel rooms, among other factors. Some hotels \nremaining from the French colonial era had been transformed to different uses or allowed to fall \ninto disrepair, and the standard of Vietnam\u2019s accommodation provisions was seen as inadequate \nfor the international tourists who began to return after 1986, due to the lack of integrated \nentertainment and recreation facilities to supplement room and board (VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, \n1991: 22). Thus, at the beginning of the 1990s, accommodation of international standard in \nVietnam was very limited (VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 2001: 39). The EIU reported that in 1989 there \n 15\nwere 18,877 rooms in accommodation units in Vietnam (1993: 69), but a UNDP and WTO \ndocument identified only 1,565 rooms that met international standards in 1990 \n(VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 1991: 20). These figures are indicative and not absolute, as the accuracy \nand reliability of data on tourism in Vietnam is notoriously weak (EIU, 1993; Theuns, 1997; \nBiles, et al, 1999;Travel Business Analyst, 1992: 21; VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 2001: 44). \n \nUntil doi moi, the Vietnamese government was the only provider of tourist accommodation in \nthe country, but now state enterprises no longer hold a monopoly and private and foreign \ninvestors have also become involved. As a result of the shortfalls mentioned above, the \nVietnamese government became more aware of the importance of tourism infrastructure and \nsought to spur development by prioritizing joint venture investment in tourism (EIU, 1993: 63). \nSince the Vietnamese government and domestic sector lacked the knowledge and financial \nmeans to develop a progressive hospitality sector unassisted, the State Committee for \nCooperation and Investment (SCCI) looked favorably on granting approval to foreign investment \nproposals for hotel development (ibid). A senior official of FIA stated that large foreign hotel \nchains also attracted their own loyal customers to Vietnam, bringing foreign exchange income \ninto the country (Interview A, 2004). Priority was put on refurbishing existing hotels to raise \ntheir standards. Hotel renovations were among the largest joint venture projects in terms of funds \ninvested (Theuns, 1997: 314). \n \nHotel development accounted for most of the tourism FDI in the early to mid 1990s, ranging \nfrom 57.5 per cent to 99.4 per cent of the yearly total (Erramilli, et al, 1997: 280). Hotel \ndevelopment was one of three major investment areas that together made up 83 per cent of total \n 16\nforeign investment in 1992 (the other two were industry and oil\/gas) (EIU, 1993: 63). By 2004, \n239 FDI tourism projects had been registered in Vietnam, with total capital of USD 6.1 billion \n(Vietnam New Agency, 2004). \n \nPioneering FDI \/ Joint Venture Projects in Vietnam \n \nFor as long as FDI has been permitted in the Vietnamese accommodation sector, joint-venture \nhotels have played a driving role in raising the standards, scale and prices in Vietnam\u2019s \nhospitality industry in general. The following examples illustrate the type of enterprise that has \nbeen developed under these arrangements. \n \nConstructed in Singapore in 1987 and originally sited at Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef (World \nMaritime News, 11 April, 1997), the 200-room Saigon Floating Hotel was towed to Ho Chi \nMinh City and opened in December 1989 by Southern Pacific Hotels as a joint venture between \nAustralian and Filipino interests and the Vietnamese Overseas Finance and Trade Corporation \n(OCFC) (Abbott and Abbott, 1996: 193; Travel Business Analyst, 1992: 19), becoming the only \nfive-star international standard hotel in the city. Many of the hotel\u2019s facilities and features, such \nas international direct dial phone lines, international booking, a business centre and credit card \nfacilities, were unique in Ho Chi Minh City at that time. By 1990, three-quarters of the hotel\u2019s \nrooms were rented by foreigners on a long-stay basis (Saigon Tourist and Saigon Tourist \nAssociation, 1990: 31, EIU, 1993: 68). The OCFC functioned as the \u2018facilitator\u2019 to help the \nproject over bureaucratic hurdles and received full power of attorney for the project plus an \nannual fee of USD 750,000 and 15 per cent of profits (Travel Business Analyst, 1992: 20). The \nwaterborne structure evaded the ban on foreign ownership of land and became an instant \n 17\nsensation in the city, although Vietnamese were not allowed to enter. When it first opened, \npeople set up seats on the bank and charged VND 500 per half-hour for a place to sit and watch \nthe hotel (Biles, et al, 1999: 224). The Floating Hotel ceased operating in August 1996 and was \ntowed to a dry dock in Singapore (http:\/\/www.kurtwalter.net\/the-saigon-floating-hotel.htm). It \nwas subsequently bought by the Hyundai corporation and is now located in North Korea. \n \nThe joint venture Century Saigon Hotel opened on July 29, 1992 and had a 75 per cent \noccupancy rate in its first six months. The hotel\u2019s initial average room rate (ARR) was USD 108, \ncomparable to the Floating Hotel\u2019s concurrent ARR of USD 110. In comparison, the Rex Hotel \ncharged USD 60 per night, the Continental USD 85, the Saigon Star USD 78, the Norfolk USD \n75 and the Chains First Hotel USD 43. Century International Hotels targeted an ARR of USD \n123 for 1993 and USD 138 for 1994 (Militante, 1993).  The lack of four and five-star \naccommodation in Vietnam in the early 1990s allowed hotels in this class to charge room rates of \naround USD 150 by 1993 (Michael, 1993).  \n \nThe New World Saigon Hotel, constructed as a joint venture between a state-owned enterprise \nand a Hong Kong investor, opened in 1994. With 552 rooms in its 14 storeys, it was the largest \nhotel in Vietnam and boasted quite possibly the first escalators in the city. The project was self-\nfinanced, thus circumventing the ban on syndicated loans imposed by the US trade embargo. \nThree-quarters of the USD 62.5 million budget was contributed by the Hong Kong investor New \nWorld, with Saigontourist Holding Company covering the balance (Michael, 1993). \n \n 18\nBy 2001, many of the large international hotel chains had opened hotels in Vietnam, with many \nof the hotels in the biggest cities being operated by Vietnamese\/foreign joint ventures \n(VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 2001: 41). In 2000, 182 of the 194 foreign-invested hotel and tourism \nprojects were joint ventures, with 6 each of 100 per cent foreign-funded projects and business \ncooperation contracts. As of 2006, a US investor plans to build a USD 1 billion five-star \ninternational standard resort and entertainment on Phu Quoc Island (Phu Quoc Island Snares 1 \nBillion USD Resort, 2006). In this same year, there were 190 FDI tourism projects in Vietnam \nwith capital of USD 4.64 billion. The VinaLand Fund of the investment bank VinaCapital, \nacquired a 70 per cent stake in the Sofitel Metropole Hotel in 2005 and a 52.5 per cent stake in \nthe Hilton Hanoi Opera in 2006, and is planning a further USD 43 million of investment in \ntourism projects in Hanoi and USD 3.1 million in a golf resort in Danang. The International \nHotel Group, the world\u2019s largest accommodation operator, plans to open its first hotel in \nVietnam in 2009 (John, 2006). \n \nThe Roles of Foreign and Domestic Partners in FDI \/ Joint Venture Hotel Projects \n \nThe infusion of money and knowledge into the Vietnamese tourism industry are obvious \ncontributions by foreign partners in FDI ventures. The General Director of the Huong Giang \nTourist Co., for example, has declared that co-operation with foreign companies helps local \noperators to improve on the quality of their services, thus raising their competitiveness (Vietnam \nNews Agency, 2006). Aside from bringing the financing, know-how, experience and industry \nconnections to joint-venture projects, foreign partners in joint-venture hotel projects have been \nactive in encouraging the government to take a progressive stance on other facets of the tourism \nsector. For instance, according to a member of the European Chamber of Commerce, \n 19\norganizations such as the European Chamber of Commerce, the American Chamber of \nCommerce and the Hotel Association in Ho Chi Minh City were instrumental in persuading the \ngovernment to lift visa requirements for Japanese tourists to encourage foreign investment by \nboosting traffic, and they have been working on similar initiatives for American and European \nvisitors (Interview B, 2004).  \n \nAlthough unable to contribute much in the way of capital, Vietnamese partners in joint ventures \ncontribute in other ways. All land is owned by the Vietnamese central government but can be \nleased, though buildings on the land may be privately owned. Vietnamese interests will often \nprovide the land for joint venture projects. Sometimes government departments enter into joint \nventures with foreign firms by making land under their control available for development. The \nPullman Metropole Hotel in Hanoi was upgraded to four-star status by a French\/Japanese joint \nventure in which the Vietnamese building contractor Jeals received a 20 per cent share in \nexchange for contributing construction labour and materials (EIU, 1993: 69-70). Domestic \npartners are also more familiar with navigating the Vietnamese and legal processes and more \nable to anticipate and adapt to the rapid changes that characterize transition-era Vietnam \n(Magnier, 1992). \n \nAn \u2018unwritten law\u2019 which gives the minority shareholder the same control and rights as the \nmajority partner gives Vietnamese firms an added incentive to team up with foreign investors. \nThe inequity of this provision is one of a number of difficulties met by foreign firms wishing to \nenter into joint ventures in Vietnam. Once the firm has surmounted the initial hurdle of finding \nan appropriate local partner, an agreement must be reached that satisfies not only the two \n 20\npartners, but also the government, which may demand substantial revisions before granting \napproval (Militante, 1993). Even when an agreement is reached with the national-level \ngovernmental bodies, there is no guarantee that the provincial authorities will let a project go \nahead (Interview B, 2004).  \n \nImprovements in conditions for FDI in Vietnam Tourism \n \nThe adoption of the Vietnam-US Bilateral Trade Agreement, Vietnam\u2019s new membership in the \nASEAN Free Trade Area and joining of the World Trade Organization were cited as reasons for \ninstituting changes in conditions for FDI in Vietnam (Vietnam to Adopt Common Investment \nLaw, 2003; Interview A, 2004), as was the general goal of achieving competitiveness through a \nfree market, including the need to remain competitive with other developing countries like India \nand China (Interview A, 2004). Foreign operators of hotels in Vietnam interviewed by the lead \nauthor remarked on the increased ease of operation resulting from the relaxation of restrictions \non banking and visa matters, and some investors who failed in earlier endeavours in Vietnam are \nnow confident enough to return for a second try. \n \nForeign investors in Vietnam\u2019s accommodation sector have been making progress in their \ncollaborations and communications with government and other operators in the tourism sector. \nThe General Manager of an international hotel mentioned that the government organizes official \nconferences twice a year, at which government representatives meet with representatives of most \nof the foreign investment companies involved in joint ventures, to discuss and debate policy. \nThese hotels also collaborate with local partners such as Vietnam Airlines and Saigontourist, to \npromote Vietnam as a destination (Interview C, 2004).  However, a General Manager of a five \n 21\nstar joint-venture hotel noted that government-organized meetings happen on a very ad hoc \nbasis, with notifications and invitations to large events like a road show in Korea coming just \ntwo weeks before the actual event (Interview B, 2004). \n \nState-Owned Accommodation \n \nOverview \n \nThe majority of new hotels developed in Vietnam are state-owned, in many cases as part of joint \nventures with foreign investors (VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 2001: 45). Most of these are owned by \ncity and provincial tourism bodies, for whom they provide a major source of income, especially \nin the larger cities. (Travel Business Analyst, 1992: 13). It was estimated that 60 per cent of the \none- to five-star grade hotels and 65 per cent of all hotel rooms in Vietnam in 2001 belonged to \nstate owned enterprises (SOEs), owned by state bodies at levels from the national ministries \ndown to the district or commune level. It has been argued that the predominance of state \nownership of hotels results in a type of built-in government regulation in the accommodation \nindustry (VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 2001: 109, 159), but the diversification of this control over so \nmany levels and bodies of government can never be expected to achieve the homogenous \npolicies possible with a centrally controlled market. \n \nTies to the cumbersome government bureaucracy can prove a handicap for state-owned hotels. \nOne executive of a state-owned hotel mentioned that time-sensitive initiatives like publicity \ncampaigns can be wrecked by the long wait for government approval of the campaign (Interview \n 22\nD, 2004). Interviewees gave mixed responses as to the degree of autonomy that the General \nManagers of state-owned hotels are granted. While one reported that he was free to make all day-\nto-day decisions in the running of his hotel without consulting a higher authority, another \nremarked that even the smallest of renovations cannot be authorized by the hotel manager \nwithout the funding and approval of the local government Labour Department. Although even \nmanagers themselves are not always sure in which cases they must ask permission and in which \ncases they are free to exercise their own discretion, in general any physical alteration to a \nbuilding requires government approval. Several General Managers stated that government \nfinancial support for state-owned hotels for the most part has been withdrawn and each hotel \nmust attract its own guests, organize its own financing and ensure its own profitability. \n \nChallenges posed by FDI \/ Joint venture hotels \n \nThe recent proliferation of foreign joint venture hotels poses a challenge for existing non-joint-\nventure state-owned hotels, which must now compete against hotels in quantity and quality that \ndid not exist in their market before doi moi. In response, some hotels have established sales or \nmarketing departments where previously a reservation department was deemed sufficient \n(Interview D, E, F, G, 2004). The first sales department in a state-owned hotel was set up by the \nMajestic Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City in 1995, in direct response to the stiff competition brought \nby the highly profitable joint-venture Floating Hotel and Omni Saigon Hotel. These hotels served \nas both the impetus and the model for progressive management thinking in the state-owned \nhotels that were their direct competitors. The Director of Sales and Marketing at a state-owned \nhotel freely admits to learning about pricing and promotion from the hotel\u2019s joint-venture rivals. \nContrarily, a VNAT official denied that joint-venture hotels have had any effect on state-owned \n 23\nhotels perhaps indicative of the degree to which state-owned hotels have assumed their own \nautonomy and must solve their own problems, which may not even be acknowledged at the \ngovernmental level (Interview F, K, 2004). \n \nSeveral General Managers of state-owned hotels acknowledged that with their global reach and \nexperience and economies of scale, joint-venture hotels are able to offer bonuses such as \ndiscounts at their other hotels, and are more able to deal with international bookings and \ntracking-down of non-paying guests. Restricted in their scope to ventures inside of Vietnam, \nstate-owned hotels cannot compete in these aspects. \n \nSome state-owned hotels still rely heavily on government bodies to provide them with guests. \nThe Sapa Trade Union Hotel in Sapa in the North of Vietnam, for instance, caters mainly to \ndomestic tourists including, as its name implies, trade union tour groups (Interview H, 2004). \nSuch arrangements provide dedicated distribution channels for marketing as well as a steady \nsource of clients. However, most state-owned hotels must compete in the same market as foreign \nand domestic private enterprises for the same pool of customers. Because state ownership of \nhotels is most prevalent among Vietnam\u2019s star-rated hotels, this requires that they predominantly \naddress the foreign tourist market and interviewees expressed the expansion of their foreign \ncustomer base as an important goal. \n \nHaving previously received guests primarily from Eastern bloc countries, state-owned hotels \nmust adjust to the higher standards of service and facilities expected by the Western travellers \nwho make up an increasing number of their customers since 1986. Many older urban hotels \n 24\ndropped their Vietnamese names and reverted to their Western-sounding pre-1975 names after \ndoi moi (Travel Business Analyst, 1992: 26), apparently to appeal to the foreign market. The Dan \nChu Hotel in Hanoi, for example, receives around 75 per cent foreign guests and 25 per cent \ndomestic. The Deputy General Manager of a state owned hotel in Hanoi has said that the concept \nof guest-oriented thinking was unknown to the hotel management before 1993. Until that time, \noccupancy had been guaranteed by an undersupply of hotel rooms, and the government could be \ncounted on to provide subsidies. With increasing competition and the slow withdrawal of \ngovernment support, his hotel began to accept credit cards in 1995 and a policy of seasonal \npricing was adopted for the first time in 1998 (Interview G, 2004). Executives at state-owned \nhotels have intimated that a lower room rate or special offers apply for Vietnamese guests, and \nthat domestic tourists are targeted more aggressively during the low season for international \ntourism. \n \nResponses to challenges \n \nLow price was often mentioned by the interviewees as one distinct advantage that state-owned \nhotels still retain against the joint-venture competition, to offset their lower standards of facilities \nand service. This price differential is partly a function of lower operating budgets due to lower \nprovision of facilities and service and the hiring of local staff rather than foreigners. State hotel \nmanagers interviewed have said that they would very much like to hire foreign staff for higher \npositions in their hotels, in order to bring in foreign experience and attract foreign business, but \ncost is a severe limitation. One manager has said that she would have to pay a foreigner USD \n1,000 to 2,000 a month for a position in which a Vietnamese would earn USD 400 to 500 \n(Interview F, 2004). The management of two of the hotels at which interviews were conducted \n 25\ndecided to hire a single foreigner in an attempt to attract more foreign trade. Interestingly, in both \ncases the foreigner hired was a food and beverage staff member: in one case a manager and in \nthe other case a chef (Interview E, F, 2004).  \n \nThe General Manager of a state-owned hotel said that foreign training manuals and videos are \nused to try to indoctrinate his staff in international standards of service. In 2004, the Rex Hotel \nreceived the environmental certificate ISO14001, for which it had been preparing for two years. \nRecognition of the importance of environmental issues to Western guests was a primary impetus \nbehind this goal.  In 2004, the Continental Hotel became the second hotel in Vietnam to receive \nthe ISO 14001 environmental certificate (Continental Hotel Wins ISO 14001, 2005) and the \nMajestic Hotel has also started working towards this certification. \n \nLong-established state-owned hotels are improving their facilities to keep up with the \ninternational market. Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s 4-star Rex Hotel plans to open a new 70-room 5-star \nhotel, with a 1000-person conference hall, parking and pool. The hotel has been allocated a 3,000 \nsquare meter site by the municipal People\u2019s Committee (a substantial benefit of running a state-\nowned hotel) and will be investing up to VND 300 billion (USD 19.4 million) building new \nfacilities (Son Tran, 2003). Older inner-city state-run hotels may be frustrated in their ambitions \nto upgrade due to contextual constraints. The Continental Hotel in the centre of Ho Chi Minh \nCity has no space to provide parking, a swimming pool or any other facilities. The hotel was \nbuilt before automobiles and mopeds became ubiquitous on Saigon\u2019s streets. The large windows \nthat served to ventilate the building now must be kept closed to keep out the traffic noise and \npollution but guests still complain about the noise level. Some outmoded state-owned hotels, like \n 26\nthe Hoan Kiem and Dan Chu hotels in Hanoi, are planned to be torn down and replaced with new \nfour-to-five-star accommodation. \n \nStaffing and Service Reform \n \nWhereas before doi moi only communist party members or those with good government contacts \nwere allowed to work in hotels in Vietnam, in part to isolate the general Vietnamese population \nfrom contact with foreigners, ordinary Vietnamese are now allowed to rent rooms directly to \nforeigners (Interview I, 2004). The state-owned hotels investigated by the first author through \ninterviews often have a corps of long-term employees who have been in the hospitality industry, \nor even at the same hotel, for decades. The benefits of long-term staff loyalty notwithstanding, \nthese staff members are disadvantaged in that they gained their training and much of their \nexperience in a hotel industry that put little emphasis on customer-orientation or accommodating \nforeign guests. New staff members generally have formal education in tourism and hospitality \nfrom a vocational school and receive on-the-job training from the older staff (Interview F, 2004). \nMany hotels also give their staff foreign language training and other types of courses. This \napplies to all grades of staff from the highest to the lowest. However, as several interviewees \nnoted, it is difficult for state-owned hotels to hold on to new staff because foreign-owned and \njoint-venture hotels are able to lure them away with higher salaries. The Deputy Manager of a \nstate owned hotel in Hanoi noted that before doi moi, Saigontourism organized only one training \ncourse with the director of a big Ho Chi Minh City hotel every one or two years for the staff of \nthe hotel where she was employed. Since Vietnamtourism Hanoi has entered a joint venture with \nSofitel Metropol, employees of other Vietnamtourism Hanoi hotels are sometimes sent to the \n 27\njoint-venture hotel to train and to take advantage of the foreign expertise. Staff are also sent to \nHo Chi Minh City to train because the hotel system in the South is still perceived as superior to \nthat in the North (Interview G, 2004). \n \nSome state hotels are expanding the services offered in-house to include amenities such as \nmassage and travel services, rather than the rooms-only offering of pre-doi moi. It is common for \nsmall private operators to offer services and run businesses such as a dance club or gallery inside \nstate-owned hotels, providing added income to the hotels through the rent they pay (Interview D, \nH, 2004). \n \nOutlook for the State-owned Sector \n \n \nThe \u2018Revised National Tourism Plan for Vietnam 2001-2010, Draft Report\u2019 issued by the \nVNAT\/UNDP\/WTO endorses a continuation of dual private and public ownership, promoting a \ncareful and considered approach to privatisation to allow for the establishment of requisite \nregulatory systems and bodies. However, the Draft Report also mentions a three- and five-year \nprogram for the reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that included \u2018equitization\u2019 of state \nenterprises by sale of shares, sale or free transfer of some complete SOEs to private interests, \nliquidation of non-performing SOEs and restructuring of the remaining government enterprises \nto enhance their autonomy and accountability (VNAT\/UNDP\/WTO, 2001: 109, 159). \n \nThe state-owned accommodation sector began the post-doi moi period with a strategic advantage \nover the private sector newcomers to the market by virtue of its possession of a number of \nestablished hotels in historic buildings in good locations in the urban centres of Vietnam. \n 28\nHowever, competition from foreign joint venture hotels has inspired state hotels to strive for \nimprovements in profitability and standard of service and facilities. Many hotels have been \nrenovated or newly built to keep up with the demand of the international market. The withdrawal \nof direct government support means that these accommodation providers must operate by \ndifferent economic parameters than in pre-doi moi years, bringing about a change in their \nmanagement culture and service attitude. \n \nConclusions \n \nPolitical transition in Vietnam has affected developments in tourism and in the accommodation \nsector in particular in a number of ways. The rise in Vietnam\u2019s attractiveness both as a leisure \nand a business destination in recent years, and the resulting marked increase in tourism numbers, \ncan be traced directly back to the declaration of the open door policy in 1986. Aside from the \nsheer rise in numbers, different types of tourists have begun to enter the country since this time. \nThe small cohorts of political and industrial tourists from COMECON (Council for Mutual \nEconomic Assistance) countries that came to Vietnam in the pre-doi moi years have been \nreplaced by a much broader spectrum of travelers from a far greater number of countries. Table 1 \nbelow gives a summary of the developments discussed in this paper, within the context of \npolitical and economic events in Vietnam since the beginning of doi moi. \n \n \n \n \n \n 29\n \npolitical, economic events foreign direct investment FDI in accommodation \n   \n1986: introduction of doi moi     \n  1987: Law on Foreign Investment and \nfirst amendment \n  \n    1988: average FDI tourism project budget \nUSD 1.4 million \n    1989: Saigon Floating Hotel opens   \n1990: government declares \"Visit \nVietnam Year\" \n  1990: shortage of accommodation \ncontributes to failure of \"Visit Vietnam \nYear\" initiative \n  1992: second amendment, allowing \nFDI in private companies \n1992: Century Saigon Hotel opens.

Reforms in investment \nlaw and other legislation, aimed at satisfying the requirements of entry into these organizations, \naffect accommodation businesses. The involvement of organizations like the UN, the WTO and \nthe UNDP in Vietnam introduces a global perspective to tourism planning and has led to the \ndrafting of the country\u2019s first Tourism Law, which took effect in January 2006. \n \nThe accommodation sector in Vietnam has had a formative effect on political development in \nmany ways during doi moi. Very early in the period after 1986, it became clear that the tourism \nprovisions and infrastructure were qualitatively and quantitatively far below what was required \nto satisfy the new types of visitors. Lacking the expertise and finances to transform its tourism \nindustry from within, the government resolved to relinquish its monopoly on tourism by courting \nforeign joint venture partners in order to encourage the growth of a free market within which \nstate-owned firms competed alongside private sector businesses. Thus a desire to reap maximum \nbenefits from tourism led to a compromise of a basic tenet of previous government policy. In \nreturn, foreign joint ventures have brought international standards to Vietnamese tourism and \nthereby given a new impetus for improvement to state businesses. \n \nBecause of FDI, hotels in Vietnam have improved qualitatively and increased quantitatively and \nin size. The incursion of large international hotel chains has inspired state-owned hotels to \nincrease in size and improve in terms of service. New kinds of tourists have been arriving in \n 31\nconjunction with new provisions offered by hotels such as conference facilities. FDI has brought \nnew management styles and marketing strategies to the accommodation sector in Vietnam. \n \nFDI joint-venture newcomers to the accommodation sector in Vietnam have redefined the market \nparameters and have played a part in encouraging or necessitating reforms in the way state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs) operate. State accommodation has been forced to assume a more \ndynamic, customer-oriented stance by the competition brought by joint ventures. Re-\norganization, streamlining, equitization and privatisation of state enterprises are some of the \nresults of efforts to remain competitive in the market. The opening of markets to foreign direct \ninvestment in addition to traditional state-owned enterprises has brought about competition, \nconsolidation and differentiation in the accommodation sector that did not exist under the \nprevious state monopoly. A higher grade of customer-responsiveness and more highly trained \nstaff are now in demand to serve this more differentiated and discerning market, and Vietnam\u2019s \naccommodation market is now orienting itself to international standards. These processes in the \naccommodation industry are mirrored by similar transformations in other facets of tourism, and \nthere are rich opportunities for further research into the ways in which the involvement of \nforeign interests, expertise and finances are affecting other tourism sub-sectors such as tour \noperators and National Parks. \n \n \n \n 32\nReferences  \n \nAbbott, J., and Abbott, S., 1996.
