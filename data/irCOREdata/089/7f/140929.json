As demonstrated by flying birds and insects, flapping flight is\nadvantageous for its superior manoeuvrability and lifting capability at low flight\nspeeds2. Piezoelectric materials especially lead zircornate titanate (PZT) are widely\nused in smart structures as sensors and actuators due to their high bandwidth, high\noutput force, compact size, and high power density3. However, the piezoelectric\ndisplacement is intrinsically very small therefore some kind of motion amplification\nmechanisms is required to achieve large deflection. Fearing et al. developed\npiezoelectrically actuated four-bar mechanisms for micromechanical flying insect\nthorax4-6. Cox et al. reported three piezoelectrically activated four bar and five bar\nlinkage systems for the electromechanical emulation of mesoscale flapping flight7.\nPark et al. developed a four bar linkage system driven by lightweight piezo-composite\nactuator to mimicking the flapping wing system of insects8.\nThe optimization of piezoelectric actuated mechanisms is not straight forward since\nthe optimization criterion is application dependent and can vary among optimal mode\nshape and frequency, tip deflection, and maximal electromechanical coupling factor\n(EMCF)\u2026 etc. Wang et al. investigated the electromechanical coupling and output\nefficiency of piezoelectric bimorph and unimorph actuators in terms of maximization\nof three actuator characteristic parameters, namely electromechanical coupling\ncoefficient, energy transmission coefficient and mechanical output energy for quasi-\nstatic operation9,10.\n3The Strouhal Number is used in the analysis of the flapping wing efficiency in a\noscillating, unsteady flow dynamics11. It can be expressed as St = f*A\/U, which\ndivides stroke frequency (f) and amplitude (A) by forward speed (U). St is known to\ngovern a well-defined series of vortex growth and shedding regimes and propulsive\nefficiency is high over a narrow range of St and usually peaks within the interval\n0.2<St<0.4. Most swimming and flying animals when cruising operate at 0.2<St<0.4\n12. This can be used for the prediction of cruising flight and swimming speed for\nanimals as U=f*A\/St, and can also be used as design guide f*A=U*St for wing\nmorphology and kinematics in MAV application, where St\u22480.3 12. It has been\ndemonstrated that fr*A can be used as an optimization criterion for piezoelectric fans\nwhere fr is its fundamental resonant frequency and A the vibration amplitude at the\nresonant frequency, or the free tip deflection at quasi-static operation13. In this report\nwe use f*A as the optimization criterion for compliance motion amplification\nmechanisms for flapping wing actuators. Numerical modeling will be used to analyse\nthe performance of the system, and these theoretical values are compared with\nmeasured results.\n2 Experimental\nA 2-bar 2-flxure mechanism as shown in Figure 1 was investigated in this work. This\nmechanism was made from strips of pre-preg carbon fibre links glued together by\nnylon flexures. One bar L2 is clamped and the other bar L1 is connected to the\npiezoelectric actuator. Custom sized actuators cut from THUNDER TH-7R (Face\nInternational Inc., USA) were used to drive the mechanism. Wing frame made of\ncarbon fibre reinforced plastic strips was covered with polymer thin foils as wing skin\n4and the whole wing was attached to the mechanism, the dimensions of the wing frame\nwas 70 mm x 20 mm. The width for the carbon fibres and the nylon was 5 mm.\nFor numerical beam modelling to calculate the resonant frequency, the weight and\nlength of each component section was measured. Mass was considered distributed\nuniformly at each section along the wing span. The exact geometry of the wing was\nnot considered since the aerodynamic resistance on the wing will reduce the vibration\namplitude only and have little effect on its resonant frequency14.\nA peak-to-peak voltage of 340V AC (-170 to +170V) was applied to the cut\nTHUNDER TH-7R actuator. A high speed camera (Photron APX) with frame rate of\n2000 frames\/s was used to record the dynamic motion of the wing tip. The camera\nwas controlled by a computer system to record images of the vibration continuously\nfor about one second, collecting just over 2000 images, which covered several full\ncycles of the vibration. The displacement data were obtained by comparing images\nover a full cycle and directly measuring the images showing the largest\ndisplacement13.\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 Characterisation and numerical modelling of the cut THUNDER actuator\nThe THUNDER TH-7R actuators were chosen for their high performance and\nrobustness. Initial tests indicated that TH-7R was too large in size and had a too high\nresonant frequency, hence each TH-7R was cut into four equal sized smaller strips. So\nthe width of the actuator was 19 mm, and the dome height was measured as 7.3 mm,\n(the data supplied by the manufacturer was 9.55 mm though). In order to be able to\n5model the resonant frequency of the whole system, the performance of the cut TH-7R\nneed to be modelled first. Basic properties of the materials used are summered in\nTable 1.\nThe Thunder actuator made of 5 layers of materials bonded together can be\nmodelled as a composite laminated beam. The relations between strain and stress,\nvector of electric field Ei and temperature difference \uf044T of the piezo-actuator device\ncan be expressed as15,16\n11 12 131 1 31\n12 22 232 2 32\n13 23 333 3 33\n4423 23 24\n5531 31 15\n6612 12\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nS S S d\nS S S d\nS S S d\nS d\nS d\nS\n\uf065 \uf073\n\uf065 \uf073\n\uf065 \uf073\n\uf067 \uf074\n\uf067 \uf074\n\uf067 \uf074\n\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0ec \uf0fc \uf0ec \uf0fc \uf0e9 \uf0f9\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ea \uf0fa\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ea \uf0fa\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef\uf03d \uf02b\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ed \uf0fd \uf0ed \uf0fd \uf0ea \uf0fa\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ea \uf0fa\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ea\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ea\n\uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0eb \uf0fb\uf0ee \uf0fe \uf0ee \uf0fe\uf0eb \uf0fb\n1\n2\n1\n3\n2\n3\n0\n0\n0\nE\nE T\nE\n\uf061\n\uf061\n\uf061\n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf02b \uf044\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0fa\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0fa \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e8 \uf0f8\n(1)\nIn the 1-2 plane, the above strain-stress equation under plane stress can be reduced\nas\n1 11 12 1 31 1\n2 12 22 2 32 3 2\n12 66 12\n0\n0\n0 0 0 0\nS S d\nS S d E T\nS\n\uf065 \uf073 \uf061\n\uf065 \uf073 \uf061\n\uf067 \uf074\n\uf0ec \uf0fc \uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf0ec \uf0fc \uf0e9 \uf0f9 \uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf03d \uf02b \uf02b \uf044\uf0ed \uf0fd \uf0ed \uf0fd \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0ea \uf0fa \uf0ea \uf0fa\uf0ee \uf0fe \uf0eb \uf0fb \uf0ee \uf0fe \uf0eb \uf0fb \uf0e8 \uf0f8\n(2)\nFor the kth lamina of a piezo-composite laminate, the stress components are\n0 0\n11 12 16\n0 0\n12 22 26\n0 0\n16 26 66\nkk k\nx x x x x\ny y y y z y\nxy xy xy xy xy\nQ Q Q d\nQ Q Q z d E T\nQ Q Q d\n\uf073 \uf065 \uf06b \uf061\n\uf073 \uf065 \uf06b \uf061\n\uf074 \uf067 \uf06b \uf061\n\uf0ec \uf0fc\uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf0ec \uf0fc \uf0e6 \uf0f6 \uf0e6 \uf0f6\uf0ec \uf0fc \uf0ef \uf0ef\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf02d \uf02d \uf044\uf0ed \uf0fd \uf0ed \uf0fd \uf0ed \uf0fd\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef \uf0ef\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0e7 \uf0f7 \uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0ee \uf0fe\uf0ee \uf0fe \uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\uf0e8 \uf0f8 \uf0e8 \uf0f8\uf0ee \uf0fe\n(3)\nwhere\nijQ\uf0e9 \uf0f9\uf0eb \uf0fb is the transformed reduced stiffness matrix of the laminate.

From Eq.(4), the equivalent elastic modulus of the\npiezoelectric actuator can be calculated as E = 92.2 GPa, G = 35.7 GPa; the bending\nand torsional rigidity as EI = 0.0268 Nm2; GJ = 0.042 Nm2.\nFor a basic beam element, the relationship between force and displacements can\nbe described as:\n\uf07b \uf07d \uf05b \uf05d\uf07b \uf07dH F P\uf03d (6)\nwhere \uf07b \uf07dH is displacement vector in 6 DOF, and \uf07b \uf07dP is force vector, and \uf05b \uf05dF is a 6x6\nflexibility matrix of a beam element.\nThe stiffness matrix is given by\n\uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d \uf05b \uf05d1TE C F C\uf02d\uf03d (7)\nwhere \uf05b \uf05dC is the coordinate transformation matrix, and \uf05b \uf05dT indicates matrix\ntransposition.\nAfter forming the total system stiffness matrix [E] and mass matrix [M], we obtain\nthe vibration governing equation\n\uf05b \uf05d\uf07b \uf07d \uf05b \uf05d\uf07b \uf07dk k kE v M v\uf06c\uf03d (8)\nThe system vibration frequencies were obtained by solving the above equation.\nThe resonant frequencies of the structure were then calculated based on a beam\nelement model with the above properties. The piezoelectric actuator was modelled as\na curved cantilevered beam, which has 19 nodes and 18 elements. The nylon joint\nflexure was modelled as an arc with 7 nodes and 6 beam elements. The angle of each\narc was half of angle between the two bars L1 and L2. The wing is modelled as a\n7beam with 10 nodes and 9 elements. Compared to the flexural and piezoelectric\nactuator, the carbon bars have much higher stiffness. So we assumed that one end of\nthe flexural is fixed. Experiments also showed that the lengths of the linkage bars L1\nand L2 had little effect on the resonant frequency of the system. The whole system as\nshown in Figure 1 is modelled as a 40 nodes and 39 elements beam structure.\nThe first resonant frequency of the cut actuator calculated as above was 27.5 Hz,\nwhich agrees well with the measured value 26.2 Hz. The dome height calculated from\nthe modelling was 7.8 mm, also in good agreement with the measured value of 7.3\nmm. This indicates that the simple beam element model can approximate the actuator\nwell. The resonant frequencies of the whole system including the linkage bars,\nflexural joint, and the attached wing were then calculated in the same way.\n3.2 Characterization of the 2-bar 2-flexure mechanism\nTable 2 summarises the calculated and measured fundamental resonant frequencies of\na system with the flexure joint of 6 mm long and 3 layers of nylon as functions of the\nangle between the 2 bars L1 and L2. Since the 3 layers of nylon were glued together\nusing superglue (Cyanoacrylate) therefore the exact thickness, stiffness and bending\nstiffness of this 3-layer flexure was not known. The calculation was carried out by\nvalidating and adjusting the bending stiffness of the 3-layer nylon flexure joint at 90\uf0b0\nto make the predicted fundamental resonant frequency agree with the measured value\n(18.04 Hz). Based on the validated analytical model, the fundamental frequency for\nthe rest of flexure joint setting angles was then calculated to compare with the test\ndata in Table 2. Both the predicted and measured results show that the fundamental\nresonant frequency decreases with the increasing angle between the 2 bars. The\nresults indicate that the measured and the calculated values have a very good\n8agreement for the flexure joint setting angle larger than 90\uf0b0. For the joint angles\nsmaller than 90\uf0b0 however, the measured frequencies are higher than the calculated\nones. For the case of joint angle at 90\uf0b0, the effect of changing the flexure length and\nthickness on the fundamental resonant frequency of the system are summarised in\nTable 3. From the table it is clear that the resonant frequency increases with\nincreasing thickness and decreasing length of the nylon flexure.\nBased on the stiffness and frequency of the system with 3-layer flexure joint, the\nstiffness and frequencies of the system with 1-layer and 2-layer flexure joints were\ncalculated. Although the variation of the joint layer has little effect on the total mass\nof the system, it has a significant effect on the fundamental frequency since the rest of\nthe system components were much stiffer. In this case, the system can be simplified as\na single DOF model in which the stiffness and frequency of the 3-layer system are\nrepresented by k and \uf0773-L= (3k\/m)1\/2. Based on this simplified model, the frequency of\nthe 1-layer and 2-layer system were approximated by \uf0771-L= (k\/m)1\/2 and \uf0772-\nL=(2k\/m)1\/2 respectively with the predicted results listed and compared with the\nmeasured data in Table 3. The obtained approximation values (i.e. 18\/\uf0d63=10.39) are\nvery close to the calculated value (10.94) using beam element model, as listed in the\nTable.\nFigure 2 (a) shows the measured resonant frequencies for systems of the 3-layer nylon\nflexure with different length of 4, 6 and 7 mm as function of the joint angle between\nthe two bars L1 and L2. Generally, the trend agrees with the modelling results, i.e.,\nthe fundamental resonant frequency increases with the decreasing flexure length and\nthe joint angle between the two bars. However, for a few points of the 4 mm flexure\n9the measured frequencies were smaller that those of the 5 mm flexure. Most probably\nthis was due to experimental errors which may arise due to the uncertainty to keep\nconsistent clamping conditions when changing the joint angles. The wing tip\ndisplacements for the above mechanisms as function of the joint angle are shown in\nFig. 2 (b). Generally speaking, the wing tip displacement decreases with the\ndecreasing flexure length and the joint angle.\nFrom the above results it is clear that neither the resonant frequency f nor the tip\ndisplacement A is enough to characterise the performance of the actuator for the\nMAV application. A longer flexure can achieve a larger tip displacement and\ntherefore the flapping motion, but the longest flexure is not necessarily the best option\nfor the MAV application. The power output of the actuator and the aerodynamic\nefficiency of the wing are proportional to the flapping frequency. We introduce the\nfrequency multiplied by tip displacement of the wing (f *A) as a performance\ncriterion for the actuated wing structure. Therefore the aim becomes to obtain the\nmaximum f *A for the actuator optimization. Fig. 2 (c) shows f *A as a function of the\njoint angle for the same system. It can be observed that the largest f *A existed for the\n3-layers and 6 mm long flexure when the angles between the two bars lie in 40-60\uf0b0.\nWhen the flexure thickness was changed to 2-layer or 1-layer nylon, generally the tip\ndisplacements were increased and resonant frequency decreased, the measured first\nresonant frequencies for the mechanisms with the 2-layer and 1-layer nylon flexure\nwhen the angle between the two bars was 90\uf0b0 are listed in Table 3. It can be observed\nfrom table 3 that measured data agrees qualitatively with the calculated ones, i.e., the\nresonant frequency decreases with the increasing flexure length and decreasing\n10\nthickness, however the measured frequencies were lower than the calculated ones,\nespecially for the 1-layer flexures. We believe this is mainly due to the way the\nthickness and the bending rigidity constant EI of the 2-layer and 1-layer flexures were\nobtained from that of 3-layer flexure. The 3-layer flexure was consisted of 3 layers of\nnylon and 2 layers of the glue, and its Young\u2019s modulus E was adjusted so that the\ncalculated resonant frequency equals the measured value 18 Hz. The 2-layer flexure\nwas consisted of 2 layers of nylon and 1 layer of the glue but its bending stiffness was\nassumed equal to 2\/3 for the 3-layer flexure, which over-estimated its bending\nstiffness. The 1-layer flexure contained no glue layer but its bending rigidity was\nassumed equal to 1\/3 of the 3-layer flexure\u2019s bending stiffness, which greatly over-\nestimated its bending rigidity. Fig. 3 shows the measured f *A values for the systems\nwith 1 layer nylon flexure of different lengths and different joint angles between the\ntwo bars. The largest f *A value (0.378) was marked smaller than the largest f *A\nvalue (0.777) for the system with 3-layer flexure.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have introduced fr*A as an optimization criterion for analysing piezoelectric\nmotion amplification mechanisms where fr is its fundamental resonant frequency of\nthe system and A the vibration amplitude at the wing tip, or the free tip deflection at\nquasi-static operation. This criterion can be used to design a piezoelectric actuation\nmechanism with the best energy transmission coefficient for flapping wing MAV\napplications, and is a measurable quantity therefore can be compared with\nexperimental results. Optimal design according to this criterion has been carried out\nfor a number of the 2-bar 2-flexure mechanism configurations, such as the length and\nthe thickness of the flexure, as well as the joint angles between the two bars.\n11\nThe fundamental resonant frequencies of the piezoelectric actuated system have been\ncalculated by modelling the actuator as a composite laminate and the system as a\nbeam structure. The calculated values were compared with the measurement results.\nGenerally speaking good agreements have been obtained between the calculated and\nthe measured ones, suggesting the composite laminate and beam model is a very\nsimple and helpful means in the future investigation of motion amplification\nmechanisms for MAV applications. Reasons for discrepancy between them have been\ndiscussed.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was financially supported by the UK EPSRC Grant Flapping Wing MAV\nEP\/C511190\/1 and Platform Grant EP\/D506638\/1.\n12\nReferences\n1 W.
