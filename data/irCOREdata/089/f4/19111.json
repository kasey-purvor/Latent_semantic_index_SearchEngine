Finding the cortical projection of the\nproprioceptive signal has been the focus of current\nresearch. In the monkey, a proprioceptive representation\nof the EOM was recently found within the central sulcus\ncontralateral to the eye [Wang et al., 2007].

It may be the case\nthat the somatosensory representation of the eye deviates\nfrom this well known pattern. First, eye position modu-\nlates the activity at premotor, parietal, and occipital sites\nin both monkeys [Andersen and Mountcastle, 1983; Bous-\nsaoud et al., 1998; Galletti and Battaglini, 1989] and\nhumans [Baker et al., 1999; De Souza et al., 2000, 2002].\nBecause eye proprioception conveys eye position, it may\nbe possible that the proprioceptive signal reaches these\nareas too. Second, unlike for other distal effectors, the\nsense of eye position combines proprioceptive information\nacross the two eyes. For instance when one eye is pas-\nsively deviated in one direction by peripheral manipula-\ntion, the other eye is felt as being deviated in that\ndirection too [Gauthier et al., 1990]. This integrated sense\nof position argues for anatomical proximity of the proprio-\nceptive projection from the two eyes in the central nervous\nsystem. In the frontal eye \ufb01elds, an area that transforms\nvisual input into oculomotor commands [Schall, 2002],\neach eye is represented on both hemispheres [Blanke and\nSeeck, 2003; Rafal, 2006]. In analogy, it may be possible\nthat the somatosensory representation of the EOM is simi-\nlarly organized.\nThe aim of this study was to identify the EOM proprio-\nceptive representation in the human brain with fMRI.\nActive eye movement would be expected to activate the\nEOM proprioceptors but would also invoke a motor com-\nmand. Hence we also used passive movement to stimulate\nthe proprioceptors in the absence of an ocular motor com-\nmand. Without visual feedback, pressing one eye produces\na passive rotation of the eye in the absence of movement\nof the other eye [Ilg et al., 1989], which suggest there is no\noculomotor command in response to the passive deviation\nof one eye. The participants brie\ufb02y pressed (<1 s) their\neye with their index \ufb01nger from the contralateral hand. To\ncontrol for brain activity evoked by the movement of the\n\ufb01nger, we added a voluntary eye movement condition.\nThis condition stimulates the EOM proprioceptive recep-\ntors, but involves no \ufb01nger movement. The activity com-\nmon to both active and passive eye movement would\ninclude activity related to the EOM proprioceptive compo-\nnent, without activity related to \ufb01nger movement. Tactile\nstimulation on the outer eyelid occurs during passive eye\nmovement and some tactile stimulation on the inner eyelid\noccurs both during active and passive movement. To\nremove this tactile component, we added a control condi-\ntion where the participants gently touched their eyelid\nwith their index \ufb01nger \u2013 without inducing movement of\nthe eyeball. We used a very liberal threshold (P > 0.05\nuncorrected) to identify the voxels activated by a mere\ntouch on the eyelid. These voxels were removed from the\nanalysis to ensure that our results do not involve the tac-\ntile component. Thus, we assumed that the brain areas\nwhere EOM proprioception projects to would activate dur-\ning both active and passive eye movement, but not during\ntactile stimulation of the eyelid alone.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nEighteen healthy, right-handed adults (12 female, age\nmedian 21, range 18\u201353) gave written informed consent to\nparticipate in this study and received \ufb01nancial compensa-\ntion for their time. The study was approved by the School\nof Psychology Ethics Committee at the University of\nBirmingham.\nTask\nExperiment 1: Eye position\nEach participant completed six runs (three runs for each\neye). They kept their eyes closed throughout the experi-\nment. One hand rested on top of the head coil so that their\nindex \ufb01nger could easily reach the outer canthus of the\neyelid contralateral to the hand. There were four different\ntypes of trials: (a) passive (the participant brie\ufb02y pushed\nthe eye medially with their index \ufb01nger, which touched\nthe eyelid at the outer canthus. The push was as brief as\npossible lasting less than 1 s.); (b) touch (the participant\ntouched the eyelid at the same location, without moving\nthe eyeball); (c) active (the participant shifted their gaze\u2014\nwith eyes closed\u2014to one side then back to the central\nposition); and (d) rest.\nTrials of each type were grouped in 25 s blocks. Each\nblock began with a verbal instruction (4.8 s duration).\nWithin each block, a 100 ms tone cued the start of each\ntrial. The time interval between the onsets of two consecu-\ntive trials was chosen randomly from a normal distribu-\ntion with a mean of 2 s and standard deviation of 0.5 s\n(range 1.34\u20132.82 s). The median number of trials in each\nblock was 10 (range 9\u201311). The participants performed\neach block type four times within each 400-s run. Block\norder was counterbalanced across runs and subjects.\nBefore the experiment, participants practiced pushing\ntheir eyeball during normal binocular vision, and\nincreased the force until they produced double vision. An\neye press of a strength that produces double vision should\nbe suf\ufb01cient to passively displace the eyeball in the\nabsence of visual feedback.\nWhen the right eye was tested, participants pushed or\ntouched their right eyelid using their left index \ufb01nger or\nshifted their gaze to the left then back to center. For the\nleft eye, they did the opposite. Order of exposure was\ncounterbalanced across participants.\nThe participants were asked to demonstrate all tasks\noutside the scanner while lying on the scanner bed with\nthe head coil on to ensure participants understood and\nwere able to perform these tasks.\nr Balslev et al. r\nr 2 r\nExperiment 2: Finger tapping\nTo locate the EOM proprioceptive representation relative\nto the hand area, participants completed two runs of index\n\ufb01nger tapping alternating with rest. The participants\u2019 arms\nwere relaxed by their side supported by cushions. There\nwere two types of trials: (a) tap (the participant tapped\nwith their left index \ufb01nger) and (b) rest. The start of each\ntrial was signaled by an auditory cue. The trials were\ngrouped in blocks of 25 s each and presented alternately.\nThe order of condition presentation was randomized\nacross subjects. The two hands were tested in separate\nruns in counterbalanced order.\nData Acquisition\nGradient-echo echo-planar images were acquired with a\n3-T Philips Achieva scanner with TR \u00bc 3 s\/volume, TE \u00bc\n0.035 s, FOV \u00bc 240 mm \u0001 147 mm \u0001 240 mm (in antero-\nposterior, inferior to superior, right to left direction,\nrespectively) and voxel size \u00bc 2.5 mm \u0001 2.5 mm \u0001 3 mm.\nForty-nine horizontal slices of 3 mm thickness covering\nthe entire brain including the cerebellum were acquired\nfrom the bottom to the top of the brain. In addition, whole\nbrain T1-weighted anatomical scans were collected with 1\nmm \u0001 1 mm \u0001 2 mm resolution.\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed with SPM5 (http:\/\/www.\ufb01l.ion.\nucl.ac.uk\/spm\/software\/spm5). The images were real-\nigned, slice-timing corrected, spatially normalized to\nMNI152-template (ICBM) and smoothed with an 8 mm\nFWHM \ufb01lter. The design matrix for single subject analyses\nincluded three regressors (passive, touch, and active) in\nExperiment 1 or one regressor (\ufb01nger tapping) in Experi-\nment 2. The timing of these events was calculated from the\nvector of onset for the pacing tone by adding 0.4 s to\napproximate the participant\u2019s reaction time. The design\nmatrix also included a regressor for the onset of the sound\nsignal regardless of trial type. All events were modeled by\nconvolving the event vectors with the hemodynamic\nresponse function. To account for head motion, the six\nparameters from the realignment transformations (three\ntranslations, three rotations) were added to the design ma-\ntrix. The cut-off frequency for high-pass \ufb01ltering was 1\/128 s.\nFor Experiment 1, to identify areas that receive EOM\nproprioceptive input we used the conjunction (passive-rest)\nAND (active-rest) masked exclusively with the contrast\ntouch-rest. This was done in a random effects analysis\nusing the conjunction null hypothesis [Friston et al., 2005].\nThe threshold for the mask touch-rest was P \u00bc 0.05, uncor-\nrected. We chose this very liberal treshold for this exclu-\nsive mask to remove from the conjunction any activity\nrelated to tactile stimulation of the eyelid. The threshold\nfor the conjunction analysis was P \u00bc 0.05, corrected for\nmultiple comparisons. We report both suprathreshold sin-\ngle voxels with a voxel P-value <0.05, corrected for multi-\nple comparisons using FWE and suprathreshold clusters\nof contiguous voxels with t > 2.75, where the cluster P-\nvalue <0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons.\nIn addition, the contrast active-rest was used to identify\nthe brain areas activated during active eye movement for\ncomparison of their anatomical location with that of the\nEOM proprioceptive representation. Lastly, to ensure that\nthe EOM proprioception representation was not polluted\nby the \ufb01nger movements that occurred during Experiment\n1, the sensorimotor hand area was identi\ufb01ed using the\nsubtraction tap-rest. For anatomical localization, MNI coor-\ndinates of these voxels were found in the probabilistic ste-\nreotaxic cytoarchitectonic atlas of the Anatomy Toolbox\nv1.5 [Eickhoff et al., 2005].\nRESULTS\nFor the right eye, the conjuction analysis identi\ufb01ed three\nsuprathreshold voxels (voxel P > 0.05 FEW corrected)\nlocated symmetrically in the sensorimotor cortex of both\nhemispheres (Table I and Fig. 1a, top pannel) and one\nsuprathreshold cluster in the ipsilateral (right) hemisphere\n(561 contiguous voxels, 4.4 cm3, voxel P > 0.05 corrected\nfor multiple comparisons) (Fig. 1b, top pannel). For the left\neye, the conjuction identi\ufb01ed one suprathreshold voxel\nlocated in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex (Table I and\nFig. 1a, bottom pannel) and one suprathreshold cluster\n(409 contiguous voxels, 3.2 cm3) located in the contralat-\neral (right) sensorimotor cortex (Fig. 1b, bottom pannel).\nNo other signi\ufb01cant voxels or clusters were found. Thus,\nfor both eyes, the whole brain analysis returned a bilateral\npattern of activation in the somatosensory and motor\ncortices.\nThe probable location for the peak activated voxels for\nthe eye proprioceptive representation was in areas 4p, 3a,\nTABLE I.

At these locations the BOLD signal\nincreased in the conditions that involved active and pas-\nsive movement of the eye and showed no change or even\na decrease in activity during tactile stimulation of the\neyelid (Fig. 2).\nVoluntary eye movement (active-rest) activated areas in\nthe premotor, supplementary motor, posterior parietal cor-\ntex, and the cerebellum (Fig. 3), in line with previous\nreports [Corbetta et al., 1998; Grosbras et al., 2005].\nThe Brodmann area location of the voxels in the precentral\nand postcentral gyri are reported in Table II. As expected,\nthe coordinates of the peak activations during active\neye movement were anterior of the peak activations of the\neye proprioceptive representation, with some overlap.\nAlthough the group level cluster found during active eye\nmovement had local maxima within BA 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, and\n6 (Table II) similar to the proprioceptive representation of\nEOM, the distribution of this activity differed between the\ntwo contrasts. For the active eye movement the activity\nwas strongly biased toward motor\/premotor cytoarchitec-\ntonic areas, whereas for eye proprioception, the activity\nwas distributed more equally across the central sulcus.\nThus, three of four peak voxels for the eye proprioceptive\nrepresentation had some probability of location within a\nsomatosensory area, whereas for active eye movement\nonly one of six suprathreshold voxels could have fallen\nwithin a somatosensory cytoarchitectonic area (Table II).\nFor Experiment 2, \ufb01nger tapping activated areas in the\nfrontal and parietal lobes and the cerebellum in line with\nprevious reports [Cramer et al., 1999]. For the purpose of\nthis study, we focused on the voxels in the precentral and\npostcentral gyri. Right index \ufb01nger tapping activated\nthe contralateral precentral\/postcentral gyrus, whereas for\nthe left index \ufb01nger the activation was bilateral, albeit\nwith the largest cluster in the contralateral hemisphere\n(Table III). All but one of these local maxima fell within\npremotor and motor cytoarchitectonic areas and had zero\nprobability of being located within a somatosensory\ncytoarchitectonic area.\nDISCUSSION\nThis fMRI study identi\ufb01ed a proprioceptive representa-\ntion of the eye muscles as bilateral, in the somatosensory\ncortex and extending into the motor cortex. This pattern of\nactivation was common for both eyes. We suggest that this\nis the cortical site where EOM proprioception is relayed.\nThe suprathreshold voxels were located within both the\npostcentral and precentral gyri. It is unlikely that this ana-\ntomical location in the motor cortex re\ufb02ects a contamina-\ntion due to a motor command to EOM for three reasons.\nFirst, eye position recordings using a very sensitive tech-\nnique (scleral search coils) have shown that in the absence\nof visual feedback, pressing the eye produces rotation of\nthat eye alone while the contralateral eye does not move\n[Ilg et al., 1989]. This suggests that passive eye movement\nevokes no reactive ocular motor command. Second, the\nclusters of activation in our study were located posterior\nto the putative location of the frontal eye \ufb01elds, as identi-\n\ufb01ed with meta-analytical techniques across a large number\nof functional imaging studies [Grosbras et al., 2005;\nNielsen and Hansen, 2002]. Third, we did not \ufb01nd any\nassociated activation in the posterior parietal lobes, which\nis typically associated with active eye movement or shift-\ning attention [Grosbras et al., 2005]. This suggests that the\nFigure 1.\nEye muscle proprioceptive representation.

The activations are de\ufb01ned by the conjunction\nbetween active and passive eye movement [(active-rest) AND\n(passive-rest)] after removing the voxels activated by tactile\nstimulation of the eyelid (touch-rest). The threshold of the\nexclusive mask (touch-rest) was 0.05 uncorrected. Top pannel:\nright eye proprioceptive representation, bottom pannel: left eye\nproprioceptive representation. For localization purposes the\nfunctional map is overlaid on a single-subject structural MR-tem-\nplate (SPM5).\nr Balslev et al. r\nr 4 r\nregions identi\ufb01ed in this study differ from those actively\ncontrolling eye movements or shifts in spatial attention.\nSimilarly, it is unlikely that the index \ufb01nger movement\nused to push or touch the eye in the passive and touch tri-\nals contaminated the representation of eye proprioception.\nThe eye proprioceptive representation was identi\ufb01ed using\nthe conjunction (passive-rest) AND (active-rest). The con-\njunction identi\ufb01es areas that are activated during both con-\ntrasts. There was no \ufb01nger movement in the active\ncondition and therefore it is unlikely that this contrast,\nand therefore the conjunction, would be driven by \ufb01nger\nmovement.\nFinally, the liberal threshold of the exclusive mask\n(touch-rest) we used rules out a contamination from tactile\nstimulation of the eyelid and activation due to \ufb01nger\nmovement. BOLD activity plots con\ufb01rmed that at all\nsuprathreshold voxels activity increased during active and\npassive eye movement, whereas during tactile stimulation\nFigure 2.\nActivity change across conditions at the peak activated voxels.\nFor the right eye proprioceptive representation these voxels\nwere located in (a) the ipsilateral (right) sensorimotor cortex\n(x, y, z) \u00bc (36, \u000214, 38), (b) the contralateral (left) sensorimo-\ntor cortex (x, y, z) \u00bc (\u000236, \u000216, 40), and (c) premotor cortex\n(x, y, z) \u00bc (44, \u00026, 44). For the left eye proprioceptive repre-\nsentation the only suprathreshold voxel was located in (d) the\nipsilateral (left) sensorimotor cortex (x, y, z) \u00bc (\u000238, \u000212, 42).\nThe bars show percent BOLD change in the active, passive, and\ntouch conditions relative to mean brain activity during the rest\ncondition. The error bars show one standard error.\nr Human Eye Proprioceptive Representation r\nr 5 r\nof the eyelid the activity was either unchanged or even\ndecreased relative to mean brain activity. However,\nbecause of the very low threshold of the exclusive mask\nfor the conjunction analysis, the statistically signi\ufb01cant\nvoxels that survived the masking may be an underestima-\ntion of the true spatial extent of the eye proprioceptive\nrepresentation. For instance, if somatosensory areas that\nreceive proprioceptive input partially overlap with brain\nareas that receive tactile input from the eyelid, common\nareas would be masked out by the current analysis.\nAlthough the cytoarchitectonic areas for the peak voxels\nin the eye proprioceptive representation were similar to\nthose for the sensorimotor representations for eye\/hand\nmovement (Tables I\u2013III), the distribution of probabilities\namong these cytoarchitectonic areas differed between the\neye proprioceptive and the eye\/hand sensorimotor repre-\nsentation. Thus, activation peaks with some probability for\na somatosensory area label were much more frequent in\nthe eye proprioceptive representation (three of four statisti-\ncally signi\ufb01cant single voxels for both eyes) than in the\neye or hand representation (one of six or one of 14, respec-\ntively). This also argues for the difference between these\ntwo sets of functional maps and is compatible with the\nidea that the EOM proprioceptive representation occupies\nthe most posterior part of the EOM sensorimotor\nrepresentation.\nOne of the suprathreshold voxels of the proprioceptive\nrepresentation for the right eye was located in the premo-\ntor\/motor cortex of the right hemisphere (x, y, z) \u00bc (44,\n\u00026, 44) (Table I, Figs. 1a and 2c). For the limbs, although it\nis generally accepted that the proprioceptive input projects\nto the somatosensory cortex [Prud\u2019homme and Kalaska,\n1994], there is also evidence for processing of muscle spin-\ndle input in primary motor area four neurons [Lemon and\nFigure 3.\nEye muscle proprioceptive and motor representation during\nactive eye movements The statistical parametric map was\nde\ufb01ned by the contrast (active-rest) and thresholded at P \u00bc\n0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons using FWE.

For the purposes of this study, the table shows\nonly the voxels in the somatosensory and motor cortex. The nota-\ntion conventions are identical with those in Table I.\nr Balslev et al. r\nr 6 r\nvan der Burg, 1979; Mima et al., 1997]. It is therefore possi-\nble that a motor projection also exists for the eye proprio-\nceptive input. Eye position information, which combines\neye proprioception with the efferent copy of the motor\ncommand [Bridgeman and Stark, 1991; Gauthier et al.,\n1990], reaches the premotor cortex where it modulates the\nresponse of this area to visual stimuli [Baker et al., 1999;\nBoussaoud et al., 1998]. We suggest therefore that the\nextension of the proprioceptive signal into the premotor\ncortex found here may provide a proprioceptive eye posi-\ntion signal to be combined with the efference copy of the\noculomotor command and visual input.\nThe suprathreshold voxels in the hemisphere contralat-\neral to the stimulated eye were located inferior to the sen-\nsorimotor hand area. Mean z-coordinate for eye\nproprioception representation \u00bc 41 mm superior to the\nAC-PC line, whereas for the hand represenation mean\nz-coordinate was 55 mm. This is compatible with the well-\nknown organization of the somatosensory homunculus\nand also with our previous result showing a functional\nimpairment of proprioception for the right eye after TMS\ntargeted posterior and inferior from the motor hot spot for\nthe right hand [Balslev and Miall, 2008]. The brain area\nwhose activation using TMS is most likely to produce a\nmuscle twitch in the hand (the motor hotspot) lies approx-\nimately 4 mm anterior and 1 mm medial relative to the\npeak fMRI activation caused by index \ufb01nger movement\n[Sparing et al., 2008]. This result, together with our coordi-\nnates of the peak activation for the right hand (x, y, z \u00bc\n\u000246, \u00026, 56 mm; Table II), places the TMS hotspot for the\nright hand in the left hemisphere at the approximate coor-\ndinates (x, y, z \u00bc \u000245, \u00022, 56 mm). Thus, the motor hot-\nspot for the hand lies 12 mm anterior and 16 mm superior\nfrom the peak activation for the right eye in the left hemi-\nsphere (x, y, z \u00bc \u000236, \u000216, 40 mm; Table I). The straight-\nline distance between the TMS motor hotspot and the pro-\nprioceptive eye representation identi\ufb01ed with fMRI is\ntherefore 23.5 mm. This matches well with the 3 cm scalp\ndistance between the motor hotspot for the right hand and\nthe TMS targeting of the proprioceptive eye representation\n[Balslev and Miall, 2008].\nThese fMRI results are also consistent with the neuro-\nphysiological recordings in the monkey that showed a pro-\nprioceptive eye representation in the depth of the central\nsulcus of the contralateral hemisphere. Furthermore, we\nshow that the proprioceptive eye representation is not lim-\nited to the hemisphere contralateral to the eye, but extends\nto the ipsilateral hemisphere, at a symmetrical location.\nThis bilateral representation contrasts with the propriocep-\ntive representation of the hand which is limited to the con-\ntralateral hemisphere [Mima et al., 1999] and resembles\nthe organization of the frontal eye \ufb01elds, in that each eye\nis represented in both hemispheres [Blanke and Seeck,\n2003; Rafal, 2006]. In primates both eyes normally \ufb01xate\nthe same target to provide a merged visual percept and\nstereopsis. Therefore, an integration of EOM propriocep-\ntive signals across the two eyes is likely. Altering proprio-\nception from one eye by passive rotation changes the\nperceived position of the other eye [Gauthier et al., 1990]\nfurther supporting the integration of eye position signals\nacross the two eyes. The representation of EOM proprio-\nception from both eyes next to each other in each hemi-\nsphere may provide the anatomical substrate for this\nfunctional integration.\nIn summary, this study identi\ufb01ed the human proprio-\nceptive EOM representation in the sensorimotor cortices of\nboth hemispheres. This bilateral representation in the\nsomatosensory cortex extending into the premotor cortex\nmay serve the integration of eye position signals from the\ntwo eyes and with the efferent copy of the oculomotor\ncommand. The identi\ufb01cation of the brain areas involved in\nthe perception of eye position in humans may now allow\nprecise targeting of these areas in intervention studies (e.g.\nusing TMS) to probe the function of eye proprioception.\nREFERENCES\nAllin F, Velay JL, Bouquerel A (1996): Shift in saccadic direction\ninduced in humans by proprioceptive manipulation: A com-\nparison between memory-guided and visually guided sac-\ncades.
