Introduction \n \nMany authors (for example Anghileri, 2000; Davydov, 1991; Greer, 1992) have \nsuggested that multiplication is significantly more difficult than addition and \nsubtraction. Nunes and Bryant (1996) highlighted that a commonly held view of \nmultiplication and division is that they are simply \u201cdifferent arithmetic operations \u2026 \ntaught after they have learned addition and subtraction\u201d (p.144). However, they stated \nthat this is too limited a view and that in actual fact \u201cmultiplication and division \nrepresent a significant qualitative change in children\u2019s thinking\u201d (p.144). Whilst \naddition and subtraction can be thought of as the joining of sets, multiplication is \nabout replication. Addition and subtraction are unary operations with each input \nrepresenting the same kind of element \u2013 3 blocks added to 4 blocks or 3 oranges \nadded to 4 oranges. However, we need to view multiplication as a binary operation \nwith two distinctive inputs (Anghileri, 2000). The first input represents the size of a \nset (say the number of oranges in a particular set) and the second represents the \nnumber of replications of that set (how many sets of oranges). In this way, the two \nnumbers represent distinct elements of the multiplication process. \n \n                                                 \n1 Paper accepted for publication in Educational Studies in Mathematics \nThe array representation \n 2\nThe important aspects of multiplication, in relation to whole numbers which primary \npupils need to understand and which are discussed by Anghileri (2000) amongst \nothers, are: \n \n\u2022 Replication (rather than joining as in addition\/subtraction); \n\u2022 The binary rather than unary nature of multiplication, and the notion of two \ndistinct and different inputs; \n\u2022 Commutativity for multiplication but not division; \n\u2022 Distributivity. \n \nHowever, Dickson et al. (1984) drew on earlier research which suggested that only a \nminority of upper primary children could use commutative properties, and \u2018few\u2019 8 to \n9 year olds could draw on distributive properties, in order to solve problems involving \nmultiplicative situations. \n \nIn the National Numeracy Strategy (DfEE, 1999), which until 2006 underpinned the \nteaching of mathematics in primary schools in England and Wales, there seemed to be \na clear difference in the approach between the teaching of addition and subtraction \nand multiplication and division. In teaching addition and subtraction, there was a clear \nuse of representations such as number squares and number lines, with number lines \nbeing seen as the most appropriate representation for demonstrating the characteristics \nof these operations. The learner was encouraged to use these representations to \nexplore these operations. For example, the Year 1 learning objectives for 5 to 6 year \nold pupils were to understand addition as: \n \n\u2022 Combining sets to make a total; \n\u2022 Steps along a number track (counting on). \n \nPupils progressed on to the use of number lines in Year 3 (7 to 8 year olds) for \ninformal pencil and paper methods to support, record and explain methods. But when \nwe consider multiplication and division, we found that the approach appeared to be \ndifferent. The pedagogical processes appeared to be mainly skip counting, learning \ntables and learning algorithms. For example, the Year 2 learning objective for 6 to 7 \nyear old pupils were to understand multiplication as: \n \n\u2022 Repeated addition; \n\u2022 Describing an array \u2013 begin to recognise from arranging arrays that \nmultiplication can be done in any order. \n \nPupils were encouraged to use arrays or number lines for illustrating the \nmultiplication of single digit numbers (e.g. 5\u00d74). However by Year 4, children simply \nneeded to use the commutative and distributive law, alongside rapid recall of \ncalculations. No visual representation were drawn upon. Therefore, representations \nwere used earlier on, but only for the purpose of illustrating multiplication and rarely \nfor the purpose of supporting calculation. In the recently renewed Primary Framework \nfor literacy and mathematics (DfES, 2006), teachers in England are now being \nencouraged to use the array representation to illustrate particular aspects of \nmultiplication such as the distributive law. However, we know little about whether \nand how children are able to access the properties of multiplication within this \nrepresentation (or any other), and furthermore, whether it helps their ability to carry \nThe array representation \n 3\nout calculations. Therefore, the main aim of this paper will be to examine children\u2019s \nreasoning and use of the array representation for multiplication calculations. \n \n \n2. A model of mathematical understanding \n \nBefore we examine the concepts involved in multiplication and the array \nrepresentation in particular, let us first outline the theoretical model of understanding \nof mathematical concepts that we will work with. In doing so, we wish to clarify not \nonly our views of \u2018understanding\u2019 and \u2018reasoning\u2019 that make up the subject of this \npaper, but also the model will point to implications for developing and demonstrating \nunderstanding, which in turn will guide us in our research work for how to examine \nchildren\u2019s understanding of and reasoning within multiplication. \n \nThe model for understanding that we have adopted emphasises the importance of the \nconnections between internal or mental representations of a concept. In the literature, \nwe find a host of examples of understanding being defined with respect to these \nconnections. Skemp (1976) described the process of learning relational mathematics \nas \u201cbuilding up a conceptual structure\u201d (p. 14). Nickerson (1985) also referred to the \nconnections between concepts: \u201cThe richer the conceptual context in which one can \nembed a new fact, the more one can be said to understand the fact\u201d (p. 235-236). \nHiebert and Carpenter (1992) specifically defined mathematical understanding as \ninvolving the building up of the conceptual \u2018context\u2019 or \u2018structure\u2019 mentioned above: \n \n\u201cThe mathematics is understood if its mental representation is part of a network of representations. The \ndegree of understanding is determined by the number and strength of its connections. A mathematical \nidea, procedure, or fact is understood thoroughly if it is linked to existing networks with stronger or \nmore numerous connections.\u201d (p. 67) \n \nSierpinska (1994) identified \u2018acts of understanding\u2019 as being the mental experience \nassociated with linking what is to be understood with the \u2018basis\u2019 for that \nunderstanding, and the \u2018processes of understanding\u2019 involving links being made \nbetween acts of understanding through reasoning processes.  \n \nCentral to the model of understanding that we use is this notion of the connections or \nlinks that a person makes. The next step is to define what is being linked. Hiebert and \nCarpenter referred to \u2018mental representations\u2019 of a concept. Davis (1984) defined \nthese mental or internal representations of concepts as: \n \n\u201cAny mathematical concept, or technique, or strategy \u2013 or anything else mathematical that involves \neither information or some means of processing information \u2013 if it is to be present in the mind at all, \nmust be represented in some way.\u201d (p.203) \n \nGoldin (1998) put forward a variety of internal representations, including \nverbal\/syntactic, imagistic, symbolic, planning\/monitoring\/controlling and affective \nrepresentations. The examples of \u2018bases\u2019 being linked in the definition of Sierpinska \n(1994) were mental representations, mental models, and memories of past \nexperiences. Our understanding associated with a mathematical concept might draw \non a variety of possible internal representations, ranging for example from the \nalgorithm associated with carrying out a calculation (Skemp\u2019s instrumental \nThe array representation \n 4\nunderstanding) through to links with images or concrete situations exemplifying the \nalgorithms (and therefore a broader relational understanding). \n \nHaving put forward what is being linked in understanding, we should also clarify how \nthese internal links are being made. Sierpinska\u2019s definition of understanding already \nincorporated the notion of reasoning linking together parts of understanding. The \nNCTM\u2019s Principles and Standards for School Mathematics (NCTM, 2000) stated that: \n \n \u201cBeing able to reason is essential to understanding mathematics. By developing ideas, exploring \nphenomena, justifying results, and using mathematical conjectures in all content areas and \u2013 with \ndifferent expectations of sophistication \u2013 at all grade levels, students should see and expect that \nmathematics makes sense \u2026 Systematic reasoning is a defining feature of mathematics.\u201d (p. 56-57) \n \nIn fact, we choose to consider reasoning in a broader way, more simply \u201cas the \nprocess of drawing conclusions\u201d (Leighton, 2004). The process of being able to link \none mental representation to another can then be thought of as the process of \nconcluding why we can link one representation to another. For example, if we have \nthe two representations of 7\u00d73 and 3\u00d77 associated with the concept of multiplication, \nour understanding might include the link that both of these calculations provide the \nsame answer. How might this link have been established? At a basic level, one might \nreason that \u201cthe answers are the same because we can always swap round numbers in \nmultiplication\u201d. A more advanced sequence of reasoning might be \u201cif we represent \nthe calculations as an array, then we can see that the only difference arises in the \norientation of the array.\u201d In both cases, the two representations are linked through \nreasoning. We might regard one of the reasons provided as being more developed, but \nnevertheless, both provide possible ways in which the representations can be linked. \nThis view of reasoning allows us to include the less sophisticated reasoning that we \nmight see from pupils, although the goal of mathematics is to progress towards the \nsystematic reasoning highlighted by the NCTM. We see reasoning as the process by \nwhich, both informally and more formally, the links between representations are \nestablished. Christou & Papageorgiou (2007) described the process of reasoning as \nthus: \n \n\u201cReasoning, in general, involves inferences that are drawn from principles and from evidence, whereby \nthe individual infers new conclusions or evaluates proposed conclusions from what is already known.\u201d \n(p.56) \n \nTherefore, a further insight that we can gain is that reasoning can be used to both \ndemonstrate existing understanding (i.e. to explain links between representations) or \nto develop understanding further (i.e. to establish links between representations). \nLawson (1994) highlighted reasoning as being a key part of the constructive process. \nIt is the process of trying to link between our existing understanding of a concept and \na range of alternative conceptions or representations that brings about Piaget\u2019s \nprocesses of assimilation or accommodation. Steinbring (1997), in his epistemological \nstructure of mathematical knowledge, also highlights that \u201cit is necessary to create a \n\u2018productive\u2019 tension between the sign system and a structural referent context and to \ndevelop and maintain this tension. Only the relative differences between these two \nsystems allows students to actively develop meaning by contrasting and comparing \nthe (new) sign\/symbol system with the (relatively familiar) reference context\u201d (p. 79).  \nAs we try and reason between more representations associated with a concept, our \nunderstanding will develop as we encounter difficulties with our reasoning. In \nThe array representation \n 5\nsummary then, we have the following picture to represent this \u2018representational-\nreasoning\u2019 model of understanding: \n \n \nFigure 1: Diagrammatical representation of the \u2018representational-reasoning\u2019 model of understanding \n \nThe thicker and thinner lines in the diagram are used to denote different levels of \nreasoning between representations. For example, as we highlighted above, reasoning \nbetween representations may be at a basic level indicative of instrumental \nunderstanding, or it might be more advanced, perhaps a product of a deductive \nprocess.  \n \n \n3. Implications of the model of understanding  \n \nHaving described the model of mathematical understanding that we will use, we can \nalso examine the implications of this model for a person\u2019s understanding and how we \nmight examine understanding. First of all, from the picture of understanding that we \nhave, there is nothing to prevent us from creating additional links to our \nunderstanding of a particular concept. Also, if we have encountered a concept to any \ndegree (even, for example, a word associated with that concept), then there will be \nsome links that we construct (the word might sound like another word we know).  \n \n\u201cUnderstanding is not a dichotomous state, but a continuum \u2026 Everyone understands to some degree \nanything that they know about. It also follows that understanding is never complete; for we can always \nadd more knowledge, another episode, say, or refine an image, or see new links between things we \nknow already.\u201d (White and Gunston, 1992, p.6) \n \nThe links that we construct might not always be the links that our teachers would have \nwanted us to construct, being influenced by our diverse range of social experiences \n(i.e. the social constructivist view of understanding, Ernest, 1994). However, with this \nmodel of understanding, we move away from the idea that understanding is something \nthat we have or do not have, and that mathematics is something we know or do not \nknow, that we can or cannot do. Rather, we have differing degrees of understanding. \nWithin this picture, we are more active participants in the construction of \nunderstanding. \n \nA second implication of the model is that in order to examine someone\u2019s \nunderstanding of a mathematical concept, it is important that we examine the \nconnections that a person makes to that concept. Of course, we cannot see these \ninternal connections directly; rather, we must observe the connections that a person \ncan demonstrate and infer their understanding from these. Methods such as mind \nThe array representation \n 6\nmaps and concept maps have been put forward as ways of assessing understanding \n(for example, in the field of mathematics education, Williams, 1998, McGowan and \nTall, 1999, and Brinkmann, 2003). However, it is not just a case of looking at the \nnumber of connections but the quality or strength of the connections as well. With \nconcept maps or mind maps, White and Gunston (1992) argued that the reasons for \neach link should also be given in the diagrams as well. More commonly, when we \nwish to examine a student\u2019s mathematical understanding, we might ask them to \nexplain their reasoning (i.e. demonstrate the links that they have made through \nreasoning) either verbally or in a written format. We might use clinical interviews or \ntask-based interviews (e.g. Davis, 1984) to probe the student\u2019s understanding (i.e. to \nsee what links they can reason), or open-ended questions. The difficulty lies in \naccessing the large number of links that might make up the understanding: \n \n\u201cUnderstanding usually cannot be inferred from a single response on a single task; any individual task \ncan be performed correctly without understanding. A variety of tasks, then, are needed to generate a \nprofile of behavioural evidence.\u201d (Hiebert and Carpenter, 1992, p. 89)  \n \nWe might therefore provide a variety of opportunities for links to be demonstrated in \norder to get a broader picture of understanding. For example, Niemi (1996), in \nexamining students\u2019 understanding of fractions, used a problem solving task where \nstudents justified their methods, an open-ended task where they explained fractions \nmore broadly and a task examining the fluency with which students could access \nvisual representations. In these tasks, the open-ended task provided the opportunity to \nsee the possible links that students made, the problem solving task specifically looked \nat the reasoning used by the students when linking between the problems and their \nunderstanding of fractions, and the final task examined which links to visual \nrepresentations the students could quickly access. Similarly, Lawson and \nChinnappan\u2019s (2000) study of students\u2019 geometrical knowledge utilised free recall of \ntheorems, linking theorems to applications, linking theorems to possible problems, a \nproblem solving task, a graded hinting task, and a timed task for recognising \ngeometrical components. The variety of tasks was designed to elicit the content and \nalso the \u2018connectedness\u2019 of students\u2019 geometrical knowledge. The connectedness was \nmeasured by the time taken for responses or the hints required for solving a task. \nSpecific links were examined by presenting applications to elicit theorems, and the \nrange of links examined through the open-ended tasks involving free recall or \nproblem solving situations. In both cases, the methodologies were consistent with the \npicture of understanding that we are using. \n \nA third implication of the model of understanding is that because we are identifying \nreasoning between representations of a mathematical concept as constituting part of \nthe understanding, then developing the reasoning and developing the representations \nthat we can link to should develop our understanding. We can draw on a number of \nareas within mathematics education research to support these assertions. First of all, \nthe literature on the use of multiple representations in mathematics education suggests \nthat students who can call upon a broader range of representations possibly have \nincreased understanding of concepts (e.g. Moseley, 2005). Steinbring (1997) goes \nfurther and states that access to alternative representations or \u201creference contexts\u201d is \nrequired in order to understand mathematical \u201csigns\u201d or symbols: \u201cMeanings of \nmathematical concepts emerge in the interplay between sign\/symbol systems and \nreference contexts\u201d (p.50).  However, research has also shown that simply being able \nThe array representation \n 7\nto access multiple representations does not necessarily lead to improved \nunderstanding (Ainsworth, 2006; Seufert, 2003):  \n \n\u201cThe combinations of representations that both complement and constrain each other enables learners \nto deal with the material from different perspectives and with different strategies, and therefore can \nhave synergetic effects on the construction of coherent knowledge structure. However, this synergy \ndoes not emerge per se. Learners must interconnect the external representations and actively construct \na coherent mental representation in order to benefit from the complementing and constraining functions \nof multiple representations.\u201d (Seufert, 2003, p. 228) \n \nOur picture of understanding is still consistent with these findings if we argue that \nhaving access to a variety of representations and being able to reason between them \ncontribute to the development of understanding. Simply having access to multiple \nrepresentations alone does not necessarily result in any deep restructuring of \nunderstanding in order to accommodate these new representations.  \n \nThis notion of reasoning being integral to our model of understanding is also \nsupported by research on students\u2019 use of \u2018self-explanations\u2019 in building \nunderstanding. For example, Chi et al. (1994) showed that eliciting self-explanations \nfrom students improved their learning and their understanding of a human biology \ntopic. Gro\u00dfe and Renkl (2006) also showed that written self-explanation prompts can \nbe employed to foster learning. However, if the multiple representations vary in only \nminor, superficial ways, then again, the greater numbers of representations that we \ncan access will not result in any great restructuring of our understanding. Developing \nthis idea further, we could argue that being able to include certain key representations \nfor a concept in our understanding, and be able to reason between this and other \nrepresentations that we already have, will result in a greater restructuring of our \nunderstanding. We can relate this to the notion of \u2018key development understandings\u2019 \n(KDUs), defined by Simon (2006) as \u201ca conceptual advance that is important to the \ndevelopment of a concept. It identifies a qualitative shift in students\u2019 ability to think \nabout and perceive particular mathematical relationships \u2013 in other words, a \nsignificant change in the assimilatory structures that students have available\u201d (p. 363-\n364). We also see parallels with the notion of \u2018threshold concepts\u2019 put forward by \nMeyer and Land (2003): \u201cAs a consequence of comprehending a threshold concept \nthere may thus be a transformed internal view of subject matter, subject landscape, or \neven world view\u201d (p. 1). \n \nUnderstanding is therefore developed through connections made between different \ninternal representations and being able to reason between these. Introducing different \nexternal representations to pupils and providing different activities within which \npupils can reason would help, we would hope, to develop understanding. We assume \nhere that pupils can reason between these external representations (although we will \nsee later in the results of the study examples where pupils are unable to do so). The \nrepresentational-reasoning model of understanding has also helped us to identify that \nif we are to examine children\u2019s understanding of multiplication, we might examine \nwhether they can reason with what we would consider to be key representations for \nmultiplication. One such representation, we would argue, is the array representation of \nmultiplication. In the study that we carried out, we examined whether children could \nreason with this particular key representation. We hoped that this reasoning might \ndevelop pupils\u2019 understanding of multiplication to some extent. In addition, we were \ninterested in whether the array was part of pupils\u2019 understanding of multiplication. \nThe array representation \n 8\nHowever, before we describe our study, we must put forward our arguments for why \nthe array might be a key representation for multiplication. We move on to this in the \nnext section. \n \n \n4. The array as a key representation for multiplication \n \nSfard (1991) highlighted the role that representations (in particular visual \nrepresentations) play in the way we develop mathematical concepts as learners, \nmoving from an operational or process view of a concept to a structural view (e.g. \nmoving from multiplication as a process to multiplication as a static object, the \nproperties of which can then be examined): \u201cIt is the static object-like representation \nwhich squeezes the operational information into a compact whole\u201d (p. 26). The \nquestion we ask here is which representation for multiplication best conveys the most \nimportant properties of multiplication? The representations considered in this paper \nencourage different ways of viewing the multiplication of whole numbers. For \nexample:  \n \n \n \nFigure 2: \u2018Groups of\u2019 representation of multiplication, showing 6 \u00d7 7 and 7 \u00d7 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Number line representation of multiplication, showing 6 \u00d7 7 and 7 \u00d7 6 \n \nFigures 2 and 3 show representations that encourage unary thinking and also \nencourage a repeated addition method of calculation \u2013 a method that whilst it may \nwork becomes increasingly inefficient as the value of the numbers increase. These \nrepresentations which encourage repeated addition are also problematic when the \nmultiplication involves two rational numbers. Both representations illustrate the idea \nof equal groups, and the number line provides help with the calculation. Neither \nrepresentation however illustrates the two important aspects of multiplication \nidentified previously, namely commutativity and the distributive characteristic. For \n+7 +7 +7 +7 +7 +7 \n+6 +6 +6 +6 +6 +6 +6 \nThe array representation \n 9\nexample, when the numbers are swapped in the above diagrams, the representations \nwill look quite different. It is not immediately obvious why the commutative law \nshould apply. We contend that the array representation, shown below in Figure 4, \nencourages pupils to develop their thinking about multiplication as a binary operation \nwith rows and columns representing the two inputs.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Array representation for 6 \u00d7 7 or 7 \u00d7 6 \n \nBoth the commutative and the distributive properties of multiplication are more \nevident in this representation. There is also a clearer link that can be made to \nmultiplication of fractions. For example \n6\n2\n3\n2\n2\n1 =\u00d7  can be shown using a two-\ndimensional picture (Figure 5), where we start with the unit, take one fraction of the \nunit in one direction, and then take a fraction of portion of the unit in the other \ndirection. Both the array and this picture of multiplication of fraction emphasise the \nbinary nature of multiplication. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Two-dimensional representation for \n3\n2\n2\n1 \u00d7  \n \nWe are therefore interested in exploring ways in which the array could be used as a \ntool for developing an understanding of multiplication, in the same way that we work \nwith a number line for addition and subtraction. We have included spacings at \nintervals of five to emphasise the distributive property of multiplication (i.e. 6 \u00d7 7 = \n(5+1) \u00d7 (5+2) = (5\u00d75) + (5\u00d72) + (1\u00d75) + (1\u00d72)). This allows the pupils to use what \nFlexer (1986) calls \u201cthe power of five\u201d as an aid to calculation. However, we can also \nsee from the array that we could have other spacings. Algebraically, if we have a + b \ncolums and c + d rows, then we would have (a+b) \u00d7 (c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd.  \nExtending the array representation to larger numbers, it can also directly lead on to \nthe grid method of multiplication, therefore explaining a written method of carrying \nout multiplication calculations. Furthermore, as we have just shown, we do not need \nto restrict the splitting of numbers in the grid method to that of units, tens, hundreds \netc. Children may prefer to choose different ways of splitting the numbers to be \nmultiplied, e.g. using intervals of 5. We would therefore argue that the array \nrepresentation is a key representation for multiplication for primary or elementary \n2\n1  \n3\n2\nThe array representation \n 10\nschool children. Being able to reason with this representation can allow children to \nreason the important properties of multiplication outlined previously. Some evidence \nfor this is provided by Izs\u00e1k (2004) who found that using the rectangular array \nrepresentation did indeed result in classroom strategies using the distributive law and \nsupported the moving on to the grid method. However, individual students in that \nstudy still had difficulty in moving from the rectangular array to the grid \nrepresentation. Steinbring (1997) also provided a case study of children using the \ndistributive law in the context of using an array representation.   \n \n \n5. Methodology \n \nBased on our belief in the importance of the array as a key representation for \nmultiplication, we carried out a classroom study to examine how the array \nrepresentation could support, or hinder, children\u2019s reasoning in multiplication. As we \noutlined previously, the array representation that we used involved spacings at \nintervals of five in order to encourage pupils to split up the array, moving towards a \nrecognition of the distributive property of multiplication. The study involved working \nwith pupils in a primary school in the North East of England. More specifically, we \nworked with a Year 4 class (pupils aged 8 to 9) and a Year 6 class (pupils aged 10 to \n11, the final year of primary school in England). Within the school, pupils were set in \ndifferent classes according to their ability in mathematics, and the pupils that we \nworked with were all in the upper ability class within that year. There were 20 pupils \ntaking part in the study in the Year 4 class, and 14 pupils in the Year 6 class. These \nupper ability classes were not specifically requested by the researchers, rather these \nwere the pupils that the school asked us to work with. Therefore, we were clear from \nthe outset that the choices of school and pupils to take part in the study were not \nrepresentative of the wider cohort in any way. Rather, working with these particular \npupils provided us with the opportunity to simply observe the possible use of the array \nrepresentation with some children. As part of the mathematics curriculum, the pupils \nwould have previously been introduced to the array as a representation of \nmultiplication in Year 2 or Year 3 of their schooling. However, they would not have \nused it to actively support their multiplication calculations. \n \nThe method that we chose for these classroom observations was to get pairs of pupils \nto use a Macromedia Flash computer program incorporating the array representation \nof multiplication. Pupils worked in pairs on separate laptops all at the same time, with \nthe Flash program opened in advance on each computer. The reason for using a \ncomputer program for children\u2019s work was that it enabled us to use a methodology for \nexamining children\u2019s use of the array which we felt to be unobtrusive and a more \nnaturalistic setting for pupils. All the children in each class took part during their \nnormal classroom session, rather than being singled out for observation. During \nworking in pairs and using the Flash program, all the actions carried out by the \nchildren on the computer were recorded using Camtasia recording software. As a \nmicrophone was connected to each computer, the dialogue of children as they worked \non the multiplication problems was also recorded along with their computer actions. \nTherefore, a rich amount of qualitative audiovisual data, showing the dynamic process \nof children using the array representation, was obtained. It was made clear to all the \npupils at the start of each session that their work on the computer and what they were \nsaying was being recorded. However, we found from observing their conversations \nThe array representation \n 11\nthat pupils generally felt comfortable and uninhibited whilst carrying out their work. \nThe number of studies in mathematics education that have utilised this methodology \nof using Camtasia recording software is still limited (one example is Davison, 2003). \nIn the discussion part of this paper, we will further examine the possible advantages \nand disadvantages of this methodology. \n \nIn total, we worked with the classes over two different sessions for each class. In each \nof the sessions, pupils were asked to use slightly different programs so that slightly \ndifferent aspects of their reasoning in multiplication might be accessed. The \nscreenshots for the computer programs used in each of the sessions are shown in \nFigures 6 and 7. In the first session with each class, children were given a series of \nmultiplication calculations, one after the after, and they had to type in the number of \nrows and columns that the array needed before working out the answer. The specific \ncalculations that they were given were (in order) 5\u00d77, 2\u00d74, 5\u00d76, 6\u00d78, 7\u00d79, 8\u00d75, 9\u00d76, \n9\u00d79, 11\u00d75, 12\u00d75, 18\u00d79 12\u00d77, 11\u00d79, 13\u00d715, 13\u00d714 and 14\u00d712. Therefore, there was a \ngeneral progression of moving from multiplication with single digit numbers to \nmultiplication with two-digit numbers. The calculations were kept below 20\u00d715 due \nto the constraints of the array used. In the second session with each class, children \nagain were given a series of calculations: (in order) 11\u00d76, 14\u00d77, 12\u00d713, 18\u00d79, 14\u00d712, \n13\u00d715, 13\u00d717 and 18\u00d714. This time, children were asked to move a right-angle to \nhighlight the array that represented a particular calculation, before again putting in the \nrows and columns and then the answer. During each session, the pairs of children \nworked on as many calculations as they could during the one-hour lesson. Therefore, \ndifferent pairs of children completed different numbers of calculations. However, our \nfocus was not on the numbers of calculations that they completed, but rather how they \nused the array in their calculations. \n \n \nFigure 6: Screenshot of the program used in the first session \n \nThe array representation \n 12\n \nFigure 7: Screenshot of the program used in the second session \n \nIn analysing the recordings obtained during the classroom sessions, we looked for \nways in which the array supported or hindered children\u2019s reasoning during \nmultiplication calculations. In a previous paper (Harries & Barmby, 2007), we \nhighlighted particular examples (by two pairs of children) of how the array might be \nused. In the following sections, we have looked in greater detail at the recordings and \nhave categorised our observations, drawing on pupils\u2019 conversations as examples of \ntheir reasoning. \n \n \n6. The array supporting children\u2019s multiplication calculations \n \nWe observed that the array provided a representation from which children could \nsimply \u2018count\u2019 the result of the calculation, as well as a range of other calculation \nstrategies. Some children simply counted up in 1s or small groups (e.g. 2s or 5s), and \nother children began to use the structure of the array to separate out the counting into \ndifferent sections. Taking the cohort of Year 4 and Year 6 pupils as a whole, we \nidentified the following ways in which the pupils used the array for calculations:  \n \n1. Counting in ones; \n2. Counting in groups of 2s, 3s, 4s etc. depending on the actual calculation; \n3. Counting in 5s; \n \n4. Picking out the 25s and then counting in ones; \n5. Picking out the 25s and then counting in groups; \n6. Picking out the 25s, then counting in 5s; \n7. Picking out the 25s, then do vertical 5s and horizontal 5s, then the last \ngroup; \n \n8. Completing the 25s by rearranging the array and then adding the rest; \n \n9. Completing a larger calculation and then taking away an appropriate \namount. \n \nThe array representation \n 13\nWe suggest four separate groupings to the calculation strategies. First of all, we have \nthe simple counting strategies (1 to 3) based on counting in ones or small groups. \nSecondly, we have the distributive strategies (4 to 7) based on the distributive \nproperties of the array leading to groups of 25 being picked out first. We have \nrearranging strategies (8) where parts of the array were moved to make the \ncalculation easier. Finally, we have completing strategies (9) where pupils completed \na calculation for a larger array, and then subtracted an appropriate amount. We give \nexamples below of each of these groupings of calculation strategies. \n \n6.1 Counting strategies (strategies 1 to 3) \n \nThe first example is from a pair of Year 4 pupils in the second of the classroom \nsessions, moving the right angle to calculate 14 \u00d7 7. \n \n \nFigure 8: Counting strategy for 14 \u00d7 7 \n \nPupil 1: 14 times 7, this is easy as pie! Down a bit, down a bit, down a bit. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s it. \nYeah, that\u2019s good. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85\u2026 \nPupil 2: 90, 95\u2026 \nPupil 1: No!  \nTogether: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 (both stop). \nPupil 1: And that\u2019s 4 \u2026 70 \u2026 74, 78 \u2026 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, \n98. So the last question was 66, and this one is 98. That was so easy!  \n \nIn this example and in many others, the pupils tended to mix the simple counting \nstrategies. Here, they began by counting in 5s (strategy 3), recognising the horizontal \ngroupings of 5 on the left-hand side of the diagram. They then counted in horizontal \ngroups of 4 (strategy 2) on the right-hand side before completing the calculation by \ncounting in 1s (strategy 1).  \n \n6.2 Distributive strategies (strategies 4 to 7) \n \nUsing the array representation with spacings, we did find examples of pupils \nrecognising the groupings or multiples of 25 in their calculations. The first example is \na pair of Year 6 pupils working on 18 \u00d7 9.  \n \nThe array representation \n 14\n \nFigure 9: Distributive strategy for 18 \u00d7 9 \n \nPupil 1: That\u2019s 25, 25, 25 \u2026 That\u2019s 1, 2\u2026 25 add 25 add 25 that\u2019s our 75. \nPupil 2: 4 times 5 is 20. I\u2019ve got 2 times 20, so that\u2019s 40. \nPupil 1: No actually it\u2019s 3 times 20 instead. That\u2019s 60. \nPupil 2: I\u2019ve got 3 times 4 equals 12, so that\u2019s 24. So 75, 60, 24. I\u2019m not writing them down, so that\u2019s \n159. \n(159 entered and sad face appears) \nPupil 1: Well it\u2019s not 159. \nPupil 2: Oh yeah, I counted both as 3 times 4 but that\u2019s 3 times 5. So it\u2019s 25, 25, 25, 60, 15, 12 \u2026 \nThat\u2019s 162. \n \nHere, the pupils picked out the groups of 25, then groups of 5, then groups of 3 \n(strategy 7), although initially they made an error which they corrected after a prompt. \nThus, symbolically, we have the calculation (5+5+5+3) \u00d7 (5+4). We of course do not \nclaim that the pupils would have been able to use this symbolic representation, but the \nbeginning of distributivity was there. \n \nThe second example below is from a Year 4 pair working on the calculation 6 \u00d7 8.  \n \n \nFigure 10: Distributive strategy for 6 \u00d7 8 \n \nPupil 1: 6\u2026 \nPupil 2: Now enter\u2026 \nPupil 1: Enter\u2026 Do you want to do it? \nPupil 2: Alright\u2026 \nPupil 1: And then you can do \u2026 you can type in the working out. \nPupil 2: Alright\u2026 8\u2026 8\u2026  \nPupil 1: Bring it down\u2026 \nPupil 2: I like it up\u2026 Right, so 25 and then 5 is 30, then 40, 45, 48, it\u2019s 48.  \nPupil 1: 25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35\u2026 \nPupil 2: 25 add 5 is 30, then 45, 48. \nPupil 1: Right. So\u2026 \nThe array representation \n 15\nPupil 2: It\u2019s 48.  \n \nThis shows the pupils working in slightly different ways within the sphere of \ndistributivity. One of the pupils separated the calculation into four parts and worked \nthrough them sequentially counting the appropriate groups (strategy 7). The other \npupil again started from the 25 group again but then used a mixture of counting in \nfives and ones (strategies 4 and 6). So again, both pupils were using their \ninterpretation of the representation to drive their method of working. \n \n6.3 Rearranging and completing strategies (strategies 8 and 9) \n \nA strategy which many Year 6 pupils used was \u2018rearranging to complete the 25s and \nthen adding the rest\u2019. Pupils mentally completed as many 25s as they could by \nmoving other parts of the array and then added on what was left to complete the \ncalculation. \n \n \nFigure 11: Completing the 25s and then adding the rest for 14 \u00d7 12 \n \nPupil 1: Right, that\u2019s 100, then take those (indicates two lots of 3 groups of 5 in the top right of array, \nto be moved to the bottom left of the array ) away and that\u2019s 50. \nPupil 2: Then it\u2019s 10 and 8. \nPupil 1: So that\u2019s 168. \n \nThis rearranging strategy (strategy 8) is clearly efficient, but it is also a strategy which \nundoes the multiplication picture within this representation (i.e. when parts of the \narray are moved, we no longer have the rectangular array representing the \ncalculation). This would cause difficulties for much larger arrays where more parts of \nthe array would need to be moved. Alternatively, completing strategies (strategy 9) \nwhere pupils completed a larger calculation and then took away an appropriate \namount were very seldom used by pupils. However, there was one example of a pair \nof Year 6 pupils using it for the calculation of 18 \u00d7 9. \n \nThe array representation \n 16\n \nFigure 12: Completing a larger calculation for 18 \u00d7 9 \n \nPupil 1: 18 times 10 is 180. \nPupil 2: So it\u2019s 174, no 172. \nPupil 1: No, it\u2019s 162. You just take away 18. \nPupil 2: Oh yes, that\u2019s right, 162. \n \nSymbolically, we could say that the pupils are calculating (10\u00d718) \u2013 (1\u00d718). A second \nexample of this completing strategy was with the same pupils; one pupil wished to use \nthe rearrangement strategy, the other the completing strategy for 18 \u00d7 14. \n \n \nFigure 13: Completing and rearranging strategies for 18 \u00d7 14 \n \nPupil 1: Let\u2019s make it bigger\u2026 \nPupil 2: No, I don\u2019t want to, I want to make it smaller. See, that\u2019s 100 and 50. Then take those three \n(indicates the three groups of 5 in top right of array) and put them there (indicates bottom left)\u2026 \nPupil 1: I think it\u2019s 252\u2026 \nPupil 2: That\u2019s 200, 225. Then that\u2019s 1, 2, 3\u2026. 240. Then there\u2019s 3, 6, 9\u2026 \nPupil 1: I\u2019m going to put in the answer (puts in 252). \nPupil 2: How did you work that out?  \nPupil 1: I just did 14 times 20 and took off 2 fourteens. \n \nHere, the pupils were clearly discussing how the representation assisted the \ncalculation. It showed the two pupils working in different ways \u2013 in the second case, \nthe multiplication structure was maintained whereas in the first, the multiplication \nstructure was undone as in the example of Figure 11. The completing strategy would \nhave the advantage of still being efficient to use for much larger arrays, simply \nneeding to complete to the next multiple of five. \n \n6.4 Comparing the strategies for Year 4 and Year 6 pupils \n \nThe array representation \n 17\nAlthough the classes and the children concerned were not chosen as representative \nsamples of Year 4 or Year 6 pupils in any way, it was still of interest to examine \nwhether the different groups of children seemed to favour different calculation \nstrategies. We used the broad categories of counting, distributive, rearranging and \ncompleting and examined the proportions of children that drew on each of these. \n \nTable 1: Proportion of strategies used by Year 4 pupils \nStrategy \nPupil pairing \nProportion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nCounting 9 9  9 9 9 9 9 9 9 90% \nDistributive 9 9 9 9 9  9   9 70% \nRearranging           0% \nCompleting           0% \n \nTable 2: Proportion of strategies used by Year 6 pupils \nStrategy \nPupil pairing Proportion\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  \nCounting 9       14% \nDistributive 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 100% \nRearranging 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 100% \nCompleting     9   14% \n \nTables 1 and 2 show the different strategies employed by the pairs of pupils, looking \nat all the calculations that they completed (with different pairs completing different \nnumbers of calculations). As can be seen in the tables, almost all of the Year 4 pupils \nused some form of the counting strategies with the array, with most of them using a \ndistributive strategy as well. There was no evidence of Year 4 pupils using the \nrearranging or completing strategies. In contrast, the Year 6 pupils rarely used the \npurely counting strategies. Rather, they all used the distributive and rearranging \nstrategies. One pair, as we saw previously, used the completing strategy. \n \n \n7. Difficulties that children had with using the array \n \nIn addition to being able to observe the calculation strategies used by pupils in using \nthe array, we also came across particular examples of problems that children had. \nFirst of all, one of the concerns that we had as we observed the children using the \narray was the over-reliance on counting in ones to carry out the calculation. This \ncorresponds to stategies 1 and 4 in the previous section. On one level, this was \nbecause counting was simply an inefficient method, but also, counting could lead to \nchildren losing track in their counting and getting an incorrect answer. An example \nfrom two Year 4 pupils is given below, where one pupil is trying to count too much, \nbecause with the array, \u201cyou just count them\u201d.  \n \nThe array representation \n 18\n \nFigure 14: Encouraging with counting for 7 \u00d7 9 \n \nPupil 1: Number five, seven times nine. It doesn\u2019t matter, you just count them, don\u2019t you? \nPupil 2: Yeah, this is mint!

(emphasising the block of ten) \nPupil 1: 55\u2026 56, 57 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63! \nPupil 2: 63, upsadaisy, dropped my pen\u2026 \n \nIn the end, the pair of pupils did get the correct answer. However, we would want to \ntry and move the pupils on from the over use of simple and often laborious counting \nstrategies to identifying more groups within the array. \n \nPerhaps the most interesting example of problems that children had with using the \narray was that of not being able to represent the calculation in an array form. For \nexample, in the illustrative dialogue below, two Year 4 pupils are calculating 11 \u00d7 6 \nin the second of the classroom sessions. In fact, they already know the answer to be \n66 from their knowledge of multiplication tables. However, they are then unable to \nmove the right-angle in order to show the calculation. \n \nPupil 1: To work out 66 \u2026 11 \u2026 So hang on, 50, 100\u2026 On no, we need 50 \u2026 and then, come here \u2026 \n50, then we need to get 66.   \nPupil 2: Hang on \u2026 right, hang on, hang on, hang on\u2026  \nPupil 1: We need to get 66 in there. I don\u2019t know how we are going to do it though. \nPupil 2: OK, right, hang on, we need 50, 66...  \nPupil 1: We need a 50 block... But we need a 66.  \nPupil 2: Right, hang on, hang on, hang on. We\u2019ve got 25 and 25 is 50. Then we need a 6\u2026 \nPupil 1: How are we going to get that?  \nPupil 2: We need a 66\u2026 \nPupil 1: How? \nPupil 2: I don\u2019t know. \n \nThe pupils in this case did not associate the dimensions of \u201811\u2019 and \u20186\u2019 with the \ndimensions of the required array. This was despite the fact that they had used a similar \nprogram in a previous session, where they typed in the two numbers being multiplied \nto produce an array of highlighted counters. Eventually, by accident, they placed the \nright-angle in the correct position and complete the question by writing \u201811\u2019 for the \nnumber of rows, \u20186\u2019 for the number of columns, then \u201866\u2019 for the answer. They then \nThe array representation \n 19\ntried 14 \u00d7 7. They began by trying to calculate the answer first (incorrectly getting \n104), then tried to show 104 on the array. They again made no association between \nthe array and the multiplication sum. After about eight minutes of moving the right-\nangle around the array, one of the researchers intervened. \n \nWith this particular problem faced by the pupils, it was again interesting to note the \nproportions of the pupils that experienced this. In the Year 4 cohort, 6 out of the 10 \nparticipating pairs had a problem with associating the two-dimensional structure of \nthe array with the calculation. With the Year 6 pupils however, none of the pairs had \nthis problem.  \n \n  \n8. Discussion \n \nTaking an overview of our findings from the classroom observations, what we found \nwas that the array representation for multiplication did indeed support calculation \nstrategies. This ranged from simple counting strategies, through to identifying groups \nwithin the array (possibly recognising the distributive properties of the array) and \nmoving parts of the array around or completing the array to make the calculation \neasier. These findings are, to a degree, in agreement with the case study of Steinbring \n(2007), where elementary school children in Germany were able to draw upon \ndistributive and completing strategies in their use of an array representation. \nTherefore, at one level, we would argue that the array is a useful representation for \nchildren to use for calculations. The array, or at least the activities associated with the \narray that we have outlined in this study, was also perceived positively by the pupils \nas well. A number of comments came through from the pupil transcripts that using the \narray was \u2018easy\u2019 or \u2018class\/mint\u2019 (colloquialisms for very good).  \n \nOn another level, we also identified some potential difficulties with using the array \nrepresentation. We saw that the array could encourage the over-use of inefficient \ncounting strategies, in particular for the younger pupils, although this was less \nprevalent for the older pupils. This echoes the issues highlighted by Dickson et al. \n(1984) and raised earlier in the paper that 8 to 9 year olds (corresponding to Year 4) \nwould be unlikely to use distributive properties in multiplicative situations. We also \nobserved an interesting lack of understanding about the structure of the array and \nwhat it represented, in that quite a number of the Year 4 pupils could not represent a \ncalculation in the two dimensions of the array. There seemed to be a lack of \nunderstanding of the binary nature of multiplication, identified as one of the important \nideas within multiplication. In this case, the array was a useful tool for diagnosing this \nlack of understanding amongst pupils. In addition, despite the potential benefits that \nwe have identified for the array above, we must recognise that pupils did not \nnecessary make the link between the grouping strategies that they used, and the fact \nthat they were drawing specifically on the distributive law. For this to be done, we \nwould need to follow up in any teaching sequence the use of the array with discussion \nabout why the distributive law applies to multiplication.    \n \nIn order to make sense of these difficulties that were experienced by pupils, we need \nto place the difficulties in the context of the tasks that the children were asked to do. \nLooking at the first of the difficulties of children using inefficient calculation \nstrategies with the array, it must be recognised that children were not required to be \nThe array representation \n 20\nefficient, so they were not incorrect in using strategies such as simple counting. \nHowever, this still does not avoid the fact that these strategies could be problematic. \nWhat is therefore required is that pupils recognise the benefits and the drawbacks of \nthe different strategies, and this can be led by the teacher who has an overview of the \ndifferent strategies. Related to this, in terms of understanding the mathematical \nproperties of the array, is the second difficulty of the pupils not recognising the array \nrepresentation as a representation for multiplication. We have already highlighted \nwhy the array is felt to be a key representation for multiplication; that it provides a \nway of accessing the important theoretical properties of multiplication. Wittmann \n(2005) highlights the role played by mathematical representations in building \nmathematical knowledge: \n \n\u201cContrary to real objects or models of real situations which are charged with various constraints \nmathematical objects allow for unlimited operations and for establishing theoretical knowledge which \nis more applicable than knowledge directly derived from mathematizing real situations.\u201d (p. 19) \n \nBecause of its structure, the array provides a clearer theoretical link to the important \nproperties of multiplication than would a \u2018real-life\u2019 situation for multiplication. \nHowever, Wittmann also highlights the abstract nature of these representations, that \n\u201ccompared with the abstract objects these representations are more concrete than the \nmathematical objects which they represent, and compared with the real objects which \nthey model they are more abstract\u201d (p.18). There is therefore a possible conflict here \u2013 \nthat useful mathematical representations need to be more abstract, but this in turn can \nmean that pupils do not recognise this more abstract representation. Steinbring (1997) \nalso highlights the possibly changing role of representations in the development of a \nmathematical concept: \n \n\u201cTo develop mathematical meaning in the interplay between a reference context and a sign system \nimplies a start from a referential domain, which is seemingly familiar or which is supposed to be \nknown at least in some basic aspects, and then to transfer possible meanings on to a new, still \nmeaningless sign system; in a next step, this allows for a flexible switching between sign system and \nreference context, by exchanging the roles between sign system and reference context.\u201d (p. 54-55) \n \nIn utilising these more abstract representations, we must recognise that when children \nare first introduced to these representations, they must become part of their \nunderstanding of the mathematical concept. Initially then, the representation is itself a \n\u201csymbol\/sign\u201d that the pupil must make sense of by making links to more familiar \nreference contexts, whether these are real-life situations or symbolic expressions. If \nthe array is to be used to introduce pupils to the key ideas of multiplication, then we \nneed to encourage recognition of what the array actually represents in multiplication, \nand how its structure can be used to efficiently carry out calculations. This would \nsuggest a more careful use of the array (or any other representation) in a teaching \nsequence in order to incorporate these ideas. It is interesting first of all to look at the \nsuggested teaching progression provided in the National Numeracy Strategy (DfEE, \n1999) that English primary schools were using at the time of the study (Figure 15). \n \nIn Year 2 of primary school, the Strategy suggested that multiplication is described \nusing an array, emphasising the binary nature of multiplication and also making clear \nthe commutative nature of the operation. This is reinforced in Year 3 before moving \non to using the grid method for calculation in Year 4. At the time of the classroom \nobservations, we might have expected pupils to be familiar with the array, and it is \nThe array representation \n 21\ntherefore surprising that quite a number of the Year 4 pupils had difficulty with \nrepresenting calculations as arrays. This lack of understanding is concerning as these \npupils will then have been introduced to the grid method of calculation in Year 4. Not \nunderstanding the binary nature of multiplication would seem to be a hindrance to \nunderstanding the structure of the grid method. We would suggest that the use of the \narray representation is promoted more as a key representation for multiplication, and \npupils are given the opportunity to recognise the array as a representation for \nmultiplication. Even though Year 4 children know multiplication facts such as 11 \u00d7 6 \n= 66, being able to recognise and then represent the calculation through the array will \nprovide more opportunities for pupils to construct their understanding of \nmultiplication. \n \n \nFigure 15: Teaching progression for understanding multiplication in the National Numeracy Strategy \n \nWe have also observed the limitations of the array for some pupils in terms of an \nover-dependence on simple counting strategies. Our study has shown that primary \npupils can recognise the groupings within the arrays and that we can move them on \ntowards distributive strategies, as highlighted in the new Primary Strategy document \nhere in England (DfES, 2006). Therefore, children need to be encouraged to take on \nthese distributive strategies rather than the simple counting strategies. We would \nsuggest that a way of doing this would be to use the grid method, or at least to work \ntowards this more efficient representation alongside the use of the array, so that \nchildren can clearly make the links between calculations, the array and the grid \nmethod. We would suggest a teaching sequence as shown in Figure 16. Having been \nintroduced to multiplication situations and multiplication facts, starting at the top of \nthe diagram, the array is introduced alongside other representations for multiplication. \nChildren can then start to use the array as a calculation tool. The groupings within the \narray are then identified to make the use of the array more efficient, and then we can \nmove the children on to the grid method. Here though, the groupings for the grid \nmethod are not necessarily tens and units. The array may suggest other groupings, say \nfives and units, and this may simplify the use of the grid method for children. It \nemphasises that the groupings do not have to be in tens and units, and so children can \nhave greater insight and understanding of using the grid. The children can then be \nmoved on to tens and units with the grid as a more efficient method, and to aid \nunderstanding of column multiplication methods emphasising the separation of \nnumbers into units, tens etc. At each stage, we must once again be aware that the \nrelations between the representations need to be constructed by the pupils, and not to \ntake for granted that the specific connections will be made by the pupils. Of course, \nThe array representation \n 22\nthis model is based mainly on our findings from this particular study. However, we \nsuggest that the teaching sequence clearly shows the links between different \nrepresentations for multiplication (e.g. array to grid method) and may be used more \nbroadly to help develop children\u2019s understanding of the topic.  \n \n \nFigure 16: Suggested teaching sequence incorporating the array and the grid method \n \nLooking at this study more broadly, we have been able to observe the reasoning of \nchildren using the array, and to obtain some indication of their understanding, because \nof the methodology that we used recording children\u2019s work on the computer. As this \nkind of methodology has not been widely reported in the mathematics education \nliterature, it is worthwhile to discuss here some of the advantages and disadvantages \nthat we faced using the method. \n \nIn line with the model of understanding that we adopted, what we wanted to be able to \ndo was to gain access to pupils\u2019 reasoning as they used the array, to be able to see the \nkind of links they were able or unable to make. There were a number of ways that we \ncould have done this. We could have carried out direct observations of pupils using \nthe computer programs, or used \u2018talk-aloud\u2019 procedures or task-based interviews to \ngain access to children\u2019s reasoning. Alternatively, we could have used video methods \nto record children\u2019s work. Powell et al. (2003) outlined two of the advantages of \nvideo methods as the \u2018density\u2019 and \u2018permanence\u2019 of the recorded data. That is, the \nability to record a great deal of information about a given situation (including audio \nand visual information) and the ability to return to the recorded situation again and \nagain (unlike live situations). The present methodology also has these advantages.  In \naddition, we felt that the methodology used had a number of other advantages. Firstly, \nwe did not have to concern ourselves with the quality of the image due to issues such \nas lighting, a problem faced by video methods. What we also found to be particularly \nvaluable in our study was the ability to record the \u2018natural\u2019 conversation of the \nchildren as they worked, which may not have been so readily available if we had used \nvideo methods or task-based interviews. For example, Davis (1984) highlighted the \ndifficulties with task-based interviews that interviewers might unconsciously \nencourage pupils to succeed in the task given. In addition, although task-based \ninterviews allow us to probe more deeply into children\u2019s understanding, this probing \nmay result in the children reflecting the researcher\u2019s ideas rather than their own. In the \nexamples of the dialogue that we have included in this paper, we have tried to convey \nthe informal nature of the conversation that we obtained, and there were many other \nexamples that we could have chosen, including singing and conversations about sport! \nThe array representation \n 23\nListening to the children\u2019s conversation, we felt that the method provided a setting \nwhere children did not feel constrained in what they said, and provided a more natural \nsetting within which children were doing mathematics. \n \nThis natural feel was also promoted by the fact that pupils simply worked in pairs \nwithout necessarily the presence of a teacher or researcher. In turn, because children \nwere all working in pairs at the same time, this meant that a large amount of \nclassroom data could be collected quickly for many children. Because the computers \nused by the children themselves were the recording tools, as long as all pupils had \naccess to a computer, then recording of what the children were doing and saying \ncould be done. This is in contrast to a video method where the camera would have to \nset up and manned for each pairing, resulting in more time-intensive data collection. \nHowever, the use of the computer-based recording still provided us with the visual \ninformation of what the children were doing on the screen. In some ways, this is an \nadded advantage of the method in that the visual recording specifically focuses in \ndetail on the problem that the children are working on, rather than recording visual \ninformation more \u2018at a distance\u2019. \n \nThere were of course some disadvantages to the method. Although the method \ncaptured the informal nature of pupils\u2019 reasoning, this could mean at times that the \nchildren were \u2018off-task\u2019 for amounts of time whilst carrying out the work. However, \nwe feel that if we wish to indeed observe the informal reasoning of children, then this \nis a disadvantage that we are prepared to accept. A second disadvantage was that as \nopposed to traditional video methods or observations\/interviews with researchers, we \ncould not observe the broader picture of how children were reasoning. Examples \nwould be the social (but not necessarily audible) interaction occurring between the \nchildren and the gestures that children were making at the screen (i.e. pointing with \ntheir finger). To remove this disadvantage would require the additional use of video or \nthe presence of a researcher, and we would have to consider the balance between \nobserving these additional actions and the possibility that a less informal interaction \nof the pupils would be observed. Also, to a degree, Powell et al. (2003) still \nrecognises that video methods are problematic in that the researcher is still selective \nin what to record. Although videoing provides a broader picture of the situation in \nwhich the children are working, it cannot capture the full experience of the children, \nespecially if the researcher needs to focus on details that they feel to be of particular \ninterest. In some ways, the present methodology removes this problem of selectivity \nin that the researcher cannot choose what to record \u2013 one concentrates on the work \ndone on the computer screen and what is said. In addition, the ethical problem of \nrecording children physically as opposed to just their spoken word is avoided.  \n \nTo conclude this discussion, we examine how we can develop this research work in \nthe future. Having carried out this study, there are a number areas that we would wish \nto investigate further. Firstly, in our study, we have focussed upon two particular \ngroups of children, and we could examine children\u2019s understanding of the array \nrepresentation amongst children with a broader range of abilities.  Secondly, we have \nput forward a suggested teaching sequence incorporating the array representation and \nprogressing on to the grid method. We may wish to develop this teaching sequence \nfurther with teachers and examine the impact of the implementation of such a \nsequence on primary pupils. This may include looking more at pupils\u2019 understanding \nof the grid method and other written methods for multiplication as well as the array. \nThe array representation \n 24\nWe could use comparisons with a control group to highlight the possible impact of \nthis sequence. Thirdly, we can look at the wider understanding that children have of \nmultiplication. Having adopted a clear theoretical basis for what we mean by \nunderstanding and reasoning in mathematics, and examined the implications for the \ndefinitions that we have used, it is clear that we need to use a variety of methods that \nencourage children\u2019s reasoning in order to gain insight into their understanding of \nmultiplication (we provided earlier example studies from Niemi, 1996, and Lawson \nand Chinnappan, 2000). This might include open-ended written questions, task-based \ninterviews, or further use of the computer-based recording software that we have used \nin this study. We can therefore build on the approach that we have taken here in our \nfuture work on examining children\u2019s understanding of multiplication. \n \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe authors would like to thank the referees who looked at this paper, for their \nconstructive comments and their suggestions of related references. \n \n \nReferences \n \nAinsworth, S.
