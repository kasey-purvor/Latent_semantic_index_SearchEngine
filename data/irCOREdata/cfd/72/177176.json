Secondary outcomes\nwere rates of caesarean section and preterm delivery, low\nbirthweight infants, pre-eclampsia, placenta praevia,\nplacental abruption, and induced labour in the second\npregnancy.\nResults Compared with women with an interpregnancy\ninterval of 6-12 months, those who conceived again\nwithin six months were less likely to have another\nmiscarriage (adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence\ninterval 0.57 to 0.77), termination (0.43, 0.33 to 0.57), or\nectopic pregnancy (0.48, 0.34 to 0.69). Women with an\ninterpregnancy interval of more than 24 months were\nmore likely to have an ectopic second pregnancy (1.97,\n1.42 to 2.72) or termination (2.40, 1.91 to 3.01).\nCompared with women with an interpregnancy interval of\n6-12 months, women who conceived again within six\nmonths and went on to have a live birth in the second\npregnancy were less likely to have a caesarean section\n(0.90, 0.83 to 0.98), pretermdelivery (0.89, 0.81 to 0.98),\nor infant of low birth weight (0.84, 0.71 to 0.89) but were\nmore likely to have an induced labour (1.08, 1.02 to 1.23).\nConclusionsWomen who conceive within six months of\nan initial miscarriage have the best reproductive\noutcomes and lowest complication rates in a subsequent\npregnancy.\nINTRODUCTION\nMiscarriage or spontaneous pregnancy loss before 24\ncompleted weeks of gestation affects one in five\npregnancies.1 Women with an initial miscarriage are\nat increased risk not only of a second miscarriage2 but\nalso of complications in a subsequent pregnancy.\nCompared with women who have never been\npregnant, those who have miscarried are more likely\nto experience threatened miscarriage, preterm birth,\ninduced labour, and postpartum haemorrhage in the\nnext pregnancy.3\nAny miscarriage is associated with distress and\nprompts questions about the optimal timing of the\nnext pregnancy.How long a couple shouldwait before\ntrying for another pregnancy after amiscarriage is con-\ntroversial. Some clinicians believe that there is little\njustification for delaying the next pregnancy,4-6 as an\nincreased interpregnancy interval is unlikely to\nimprove perinatal outcomes,2 whereas a new viable\npregnancy and the birth of a child could enhance the\nwomen\u2019s chances of recovery.4 78 Others suggest wait-\ning at least six months for full mental and physical\nrecovery before another pregnancy. Current guide-\nlines from theWorldHealthOrganization recommend\nthat women should wait for at least six months before\ntrying again,9 whereas others suggest a delay of up to\n18months, based on reports that interpregnancy inter-\nvals of 18-23 months after a live birth can enhance\nmaternal and perinatal outcomes in the next\npregnancy.10-13 This length of delay, however, poses a\nparticular problem for women in theWestern world as\nthey tend to delay childbearing for several social and\neconomic reasons. Women over 35 are more likely to\nexperience difficulties in conceiving and women aged\n40 have a 30% chance of miscarriage, which rises to\n50% in those aged 45 or more.14 Any delay in attempt-\ning conception could further decrease the chances of a\nhealthy baby.Many women are aware of this potential\nproblem, which is why first time mothers aged 35 or\nover are more likely to plan a second pregnancy\nshortly after their first.15\nWe compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in\nwomen with different interpregnancy intervals after a\nmiscarriage in an initial pregnancy. The Scottish mor-\nbidity records collect information on all hospital\nadmissions in Scotland and therefore offer an ideal\nopportunity to examine the effects of interpregnancy\nintervals after miscarriage on outcomes of the subse-\nquent pregnancy.\n1University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen\n2Department of Obstetrics and\nGynaecology, Aberdeen Maternity\nHospital, Aberdeen\n3Dugald Baird Centre for Research\non Women\u2019s Health, Aberdeen\nMaternity Hospital, Aberdeen,\nAB25 2ZD\nCorrespondence to: Sohinee\nBhattacharya\nsohinee.bhattacharya@abdn.ac.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2010;341:c3967\ndoi:10.1136\/bmj.c3967\nBMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com page 1 of 8\nMETHODS\nThe Information Services Division of the National\nHealth Service, Scotland, is a national organisation\nfor health information, statistics, and computing ser-\nvices and has been in existence for over 40 years.\nAnonymised patient based data for inpatient and day\ncase activity in the specialty of obstetrics are routinely\ncollected from the whole of Scotland as Scottish mor-\nbidity records.Weused information from this database\n(specifically SMR01 and SMR02) for this study. The\ndatabase is subjected to regular quality assurance\nchecks and has been more than 99% complete since\nthe late 1970s.16\nWe used a retrospective cohort study design where\nexposurewas taken as increasing interpregnancy inter-\nvals between a first and second pregnancy. We extra-\ncted data on all women who had a miscarriage\nrecorded for a first pregnancy between 1981 and\n2000 in Scotland and went on to have a subsequent\npregnancy, as identified by internal linkage of\nSMR01 and SMR02 datasets using probability match-\ning. Women who had twin or multiple pregnancies\nwere excluded.\nTo determine the interpregnancy interval we calcu-\nlated the time interval between the pregnancy related\nadmission to hospital, and then subtracted the number\nof weeks\u2019 gestation of the second pregnancy at the time\nof the second admission, as recorded in the database.\nWe then divided the women into five groups depend-\ning on the time interval between the two pregnancies:\nless than six months, 6-12 months, 12-18 months,\n18-24 months, and more than 24 months. Our refer-\nence category was an interpregnancy interval of\n6-12 months.\nWe assumed admission dates less than four weeks\napart for first and second pregnancy events to be\nrelated to the same event, andwe excluded the relevant\nwoman from analysis. We also excluded women if the\ncalculated interpregnancy interval (interval between\ntwo admissions minus the gestational age of second\npregnancy) was less than four weeks and where gesta-\ntional age at the second delivery was missing (n=60).\nThe primary end point was reproductive outcome in\nthe second pregnancy\u2014namely, miscarriage, ectopic\npregnancy, termination, stillbirth, and live birth. Con-\nfounding factors comprised maternal age at delivery,\nsocioeconomic status (classified according to the Car-\nstairs index as \u201cdeprived\u201d for categories 4 and above\nand \u201cnot deprived\u201d for categories 1-3).17 As smoking\nstatus was unknown for 57.2% of the women, we car-\nried out a sensitivity analysis including and excluding\nthe smoking variable. The smoking variable is\nexcluded in the results shown in this paper.\nTo assess the effects of interpregnancy interval on\nobstetric and perinatal complications we carried out a\nsubgroup analysis of women who had a second preg-\nnancy continuing beyond 24 weeks and resulting in a\nlive birth. Secondary outcomes in ongoing pregnan-\ncies were pre-eclampsia, placenta praevia, placental\nabruption, mode of delivery, preterm and very pre-\nterm delivery, and low birthweight infants (<2500 g).\nWe classified preterm birth as occurring at 36 com-\npleted weeks of gestation or less and very preterm\nbirth at 32 weeks or less. All other outcomes listed in\nthe database were defined using the ICD-9 classifica-\ntions (international classification of diseases, ninth\nrevision) until 1994 when the ICD-10 came into use.\nIn addition to the sociodemographic variables, we\nadjusted for other pregnancy specific variables such\nas induction of labour, gestational age, and caesarean\ndelivery, as appropriate.\nWomen with first miscarriage between 1981 and 2000 (n=34 845)\nWomen with multiple gestation (n=2817)\nSingleton second pregnancies (n=32 028)\nLive births with missing gestational age (n=62)\nWomen with complete data (n=31 966)\nWomen included in study (n=30 937)\nInterpregnancy interval <4 weeks (n=1029)\nFlow of population selection\nTable 1 | Characteristics of women who had a second pregnancy after miscarriage, by interpregnancy intervals.

We used SPSS version 17 for the statistical\nanalysis. Results are presented as both crude and\nadjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals,\nusing univariate and multivariate logistic regression\n(stepwise backward likelihood ratio method). In both\nthe univariate andmultivariate analyses we considered\na P value of less than 0.05 to be significant.We used the\nHosmer and Lemeshow test to assess goodness of fit of\nthe models and the likelihood ratio test to assess the\nrelative contribution of terms entered into the model.\nTo assess interaction over time we entered into the\nmodel the interaction terms interpregnancy intervals\n\u00d7 five year bands of year of first hospital admission.\nA retrospective power calculation showed that the\nstudy had 99% power at the two sided 5% significance\nlevel to detect a difference of 2% or more in the occur-\nrence of a second miscarriage, given that there were\n12 744women in the exposed (interpregnancy interval\n<6months) and 7791women in the reference category\n(6-12 months).\nRESULTS\nData were available on a total of 34 845 women who\nhad experienced a miscarriage in their first pregnancy\nand had a subsequent pregnancy. After the exclusion\nof multiple births and records with improbable inter-\npregnancy intervals, 30 937 women constituted the\nstudy population. The figure presents the flow of popu-\nlation selection.\nOf these 30 937 women, 12 744 (41.2%) conceived\nwithin six months of the miscarriage, 7791 (25.2%)\nafter 6-12 months, 2958 (9.6%) after 12-18 months,\n1995 (6.4%) after 18-24months, and 5449 (17.6%) after\n24 months.\nOlder women and those belonging to a higher social\nclass tended to have shorter interpregnancy intervals\n(table 1).Comparedwith thosewith an interpregnancy\ninterval of more than 24months, womenwith an inter-\npregnancy interval of less than six months were likely\nto be older (26.0 years (SD 5.4 years) v 23.9 (5.9) years;\nP<0.001) and from a less deprived Carstairs category\nat the timeof their first pregnancy (4449women, 34.9%\nv 1547women, 28.4%; P<0.001), and less likely to have\never smoked (1261 women 9.9% v 963 women, 17.7%;\nP<0.001).\nLive birth rates were highest (10 856 women, 85.2%)\nin women with an interpregnancy interval of less than\nsixmonths and lowest (n=3992, 73.3%) in thosewith an\ninterpregnancy interval exceeding 24months (P<0.01;\ntable 2). The data on termination of pregnancies also\ndisplayed a similar pattern,with longer interpregnancy\nintervals associated with a higher chance of termina-\ntion in the next pregnancy.\nAfter adjustment for maternal age at first pregnancy\nevent, socioeconomic status, and year of first preg-\nnancy, adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with\nan interpregnancy interval of less than six months dif-\nfered significantly from the other groups (table 3). The\nmodels also included interaction terms: inter-\npregnancy interval (six month bands) \u00d7 year of first\nadmission (five year bands). However, the interaction\nterms were found to be statistically significant only in\nthe model for a second miscarriage (data available on\nrequest). Compared with the reference group (inter-\npregnancy interval 6-12months),womenwith an inter-\npregnancy interval of less than six months were less\nlikely to experience a miscarriage (adjusted odds ratio\n0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.77), termina-\ntion (0.43, 0.33 to 0.57), or ectopic pregnancy (0.48,\n0.34 to 0.69). The highest risk of adverse outcomes\nwas in women with an interpregnancy interval of\nmore than 24 months, who were more likely in their\nsecond pregnancy to have an ectopic pregnancy (1.97,\n1.42 to 2.72) or termination (2.40, 1.91 to 3.01).\nIncluding smoking status (when available) as a cov-\nariate in a subset of women showed similar patterns of\nrisk, although some odds ratios (such as that for ectopic\npregnancy or stillbirth) were no longer significant as\nthe confidence intervals were widened to include 1 or\nthe models did not converge because of smaller num-\nbers. (Data available on request.)\nTable 4 shows the proportions of women with\nmaternal and perinatal complications in their second\npregnancy.Womenwith an interpregnancy interval of\nless than six months were less likely to have caesarean\nsection, preterm delivery (before 36 weeks), or an\ninfant of low birth weight (<2500 g) but were more\nlikely to have an induced labour (table 5). Women\nwith an interpregnancy interval of more than\n24months were most likely to have a preterm delivery\n(1.21, 1.07 to 1.36) or very pretermdelivery (1.40, 1.11\nTable 2 | Outcomes of second pregnancy after miscarriage in first pregnancy.

Theywere alsomore likely to have a cae-\nsarean section (1.39, 1.26 to1.54) or an infant of low\nbirth weight (1.23, 1.02 to 1.48).\nNo association was found between interpregnancy\ninterval after miscarriage and pre-eclampsia, placenta\npraevia, or placental abruption in the second ongoing\npregnancy.\nDISCUSSION\nWomen who conceived within six months of an initial\nrecorded miscarriage had the lowest rates of miscar-\nriage, ectopic pregnancy, and termination in a subse-\nquent pregnancy than thosewho conceived later. They\nwere also least likely to deliver preterm or very pre-\nterm or have an infant of low birth weight but were at\nhighest risk of induced labour. Women with an inter-\npregnancy interval of more than 24 months had the\nhighest risks of ectopic pregnancy and termination\nand were most likely to have a caesarean section or\npreterm delivery and an infant of low birth weight.\nComparison with other studies\nThe only studies to have dealt with the effect of inter-\npregnancy intervals on pregnancy outcome after mis-\ncarriage have been from developing countries with\ndifferent systems of family planning, access to mater-\nnity care, and methods of data collection. In the devel-\noping world, women also tend to bear children at a\nyounger age, thus reducing their age dependent risk\nof an adverse pregnancy outcome.\nAdditionally, most published research has focused\non interpregnancy intervals after live birth. Few have\ninvestigated interpregnancy intervals after other types\nof pregnancy outcomes, possibly because of smaller\nnumbers of women in these groups. One study\nreported perinatal outcomes after varying inter-\npregnancy intervals and according to the type of preg-\nnancy outcome that began the interval,18 but data in\nthis study were drawn from a demographic\nsurveillance site in Bangladesh where induced abor-\ntion is illegal, possibly resulting in over-reporting of\nmiscarriages owing to the sensitivity of this informa-\ntion. Moreover, the reference group was women who\nhad an initial live birth, thus potentially inflating the\nrisk of adverse outcomes after miscarriage.\nAnother study examined the effects of varying inter-\npregnancy intervals after pregnancy termination (both\nmiscarriage and induced) on maternal and perinatal\nhealth in a sample of 258 108 Latin American\nwomen. An interpregnancy interval of less than six\nmonths after abortion was independently associated\nwith increased risks of adverse maternal and perinatal\noutcomes, including maternal anaemia, low birth-\nweight infants, and preterm delivery in the next\npregnancy.19 This study did not, however, differentiate\nbetween induced abortionandmiscarriage in the index\npregnancy. This limitation, along with the geographi-\ncal context of the study, may affect the generalisability\nof the results to other regions. Despite these limita-\ntions, these data were the sole basis for aWHO recom-\nmendation 9 on birth spacing after abortion, calling for\nmore studies on pregnancy intervals after miscarriage\nin different populations and healthcare settings.\nPrevious Scottish studies20 have shown that a short\ninterpregnancy interval after stillbirth is associated\nwith increased risks in the next pregnancy but did not\nexplore the association between interpregnancy inter-\nval and outcomes after miscarriage. Two other Eur-\nopean reports21 22 have suggested that adverse\npregnancyoutcomes aremore likely to occur aftermis-\ncarriage in women with increasing interpregnancy\nintervals.\nMuch of the existing literature comprises studies on\nperinatal outcomes after a previous live birth and sug-\ngests that short interpregnancy intervals are detrimen-\ntal to maternal and perinatal wellbeing. Our results\nchallenge this viewbut are consistentwith thematernal\ndepletion hypothesis suggested by one study.23 The\nresearchers propose that decreasing levels of folate in\nTable 3 | Crude and adjusted odds ratios of adverse pregnancy outcomes for different interpregnancy intervals\nSecond pregnancy outcomes\nInterpregnancy intervals (months)\n<6 12-18 18-24 >24\nMiscarriage:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.77 (0.71 to 0.84)* 0.97 (0.85 to 1.10) 1.01 (0.88 to 1.17) 0.96 (0.86 to 1.06)\nAdjusted\u2020 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.66 (0.57 to 0.77)* 0.98 (0.80 to 1.21) 0.99 (0.78 to 1.27) 0.99 (0.84 to 1.18)*\nEctopic pregnancy:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.48 (0.34 to 0.69)* 0.99 (0.62 to 1.56) 0.64 (0.34 to 1.21) 1.87 (1.36 to 2.58)*\nAdjusted\u2020 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.48 (0.34 to 0.69)* 0.99 (0.63 to 1.57) 0.65 (0.34 to 1.23) 1.97 (1.42 to 2.72)*\nTermination:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.48 (0.41 to 0.56)* 1.22 (1.01 to 1.47)* 1.54 (1.26 to 1.88)* 2.21 (1.93 to 2.54)*\nAdjusted\u2020 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.43 (0.33 to 0.57)* 1.15 (0.83 to 1.59) 1.55 (1.10 to 2.19)* 2.40 (1.91 to 3.01)*\nStillbirth:\nCrude odd ratio (95% CI) 0.72 (0.51 to 1.03) 1.26 (0.79 to 2.02) 0.95 (0.52 to 1.75) 0.98 (0.64 to 1.50)\nAdjusted\u2020 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.70 (0.38 to 1.29) 1.20 (0.54 to 2.67) 0.83 (0.28 to 2.44) 1.07 (0.54 to 2.15)\nReference category was interpregnancy interval of 6-12 months.

As most miscar-\nriages occur in the first trimester and are not associated\nwith breast feeding, women conceiving again soon\nafter their pregnancy loss may not have any depletion\nof vital nutrients and thus have a reduced risk of\nadverse outcomes.\nSome authors attribute the higher risks of adverse\nmaternal outcomes after a short interpregnancy inter-\nval to socioeconomic status, unstable lifestyles, failure\nto use healthcare services, unplanned pregnancies, and\nother behavioural or psychological factors.24 Our data,\nhowever, show the effect of interpregnancy interval\nafter a miscarriage to be different. In our cohort,\nfewer women with interpregnancy intervals of less\nthan six months were classed as deprived compared\nwith any of the other groups (65.1% v 71.6% in\nwomen with an interpregnancy interval >24 months).\nThus, although a short interpregnancy interval after a\nlive birth is more likely in a woman with poor educa-\ntion and with limited access to family planning\nresources, this may not be the case after a miscarriage,\nat least in our population of women. It is unknownwhy\na longer interval is associated with adverse outcomes\nsuch as miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy. One study\noffered two hypotheses.11 Firstly, a pregnancy may\nenhance the functional capacity of the reproductive\nsystem, which can wane over time, and with longer\nintervals the risks to a mother and baby may resemble\nthose in a primigravida. An alternative hypothesis is\nthat factors associated with underlying subfertility,\nwhich can increase the time to the next pregnancy,\ncould result in adverse perinatal outcomes.24\nIt is also possible, as suggested by a previous study,6\nthat women who become pregnant soon after an initial\nmiscarriagemay have been highlymotivated such that\ntheir health related behaviours may have favoured\nmore successful pregnancies. Of the studies that distin-\nguished between the different types of initial pregnan-\ncies, one18 also found that the rates of live birth in the\nsubsequent pregnancy decreased in a linear fashion\nwith increasing interpregnancy intervals.\nIn a systematic review25 it was reported that women\nwho conceived again within a short time after delivery\ntended to have a lower parity than those who waited\nlonger. A higher proportion of women with an inter-\npregnancy interval of less than six months also did not\nhave antenatal care; again, this could have influenced\nthe outcomes reported in their review. Previous studies\nhave reported that inadequate use of prenatal care is a\nmore potent predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes\nthan interpregnancy interval.26 27 We were unable to\nestimate the potential confounding effects of quality\nof, access to, and use of prenatal care in our population.\nNevertheless, as medical care is available to all, free of\ncharge at the point of access in Scotland, this is unlikely\nto be a major limitation in our study.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the study\nThemain strength of this research lies in its large popu-\nlation based nature, and the use of routinely collected\ndata on hospital admissions. The data are cross\nchecked with other hospital data for completeness\nand accuracy. A set of validation rules is applied to all\nScottishmorbidity records both locally, before submis-\nsion to Information Services Division, and again once\neach record has been submitted. These checks can\ndetect errors where information is missing, invalid, or\ndoes not conform to a logical sequence of events. The\ndata monitoring team also carry out local quality\nchecks by investigating anomalies in Scottish morbid-\nity records and ensuring that data are amended\nthrough usual submission protocols. Regular clean-\nup programs on national files are undertaken. Addi-\ntionally, the data quality assurance team routinely\ncompare samples of data from the Scottish national\ndatabase with the original patient case notes to ensure\ncorrect interpretation of the data definitions and\nrecording rules.\nThis study is not without its limitations. One of the\nproblems in using routinely collected data is the poten-\ntial lack of uniformity in the documentation of gesta-\ntional age and outcomes of interest as well as the\npossibility of misclassification. As parity is not routi-\nnely recorded in the morbidity records for women\nwho have early pregnancy loss, we were unable to\nTable 4 | Maternal and perinatal complications by interpregnancy interval in women with live births in pregnancy after initial\nmiscarriage.

For women who\nwent on to have a delivery, it was possible to check if\nan initial miscarriage was recorded. However, we\nbelieve that the large size of the dataset may offset\nany minor discrepancies such that the overall pattern\nof any trends remains unaffected. Further disadvan-\ntages in using information from the Scottish dataset\ninclude potential inaccuracies in estimation of times\nbetween pregnancies due to misclassification of hospi-\ntal admissions that could have been the result of the\nsame event. This study also spans a long period during\nwhich advances in obstetric practice may have influ-\nenced the outcomesof interest. Specifically, the routine\nuse of ultrasound for diagnosis, increasing availability\nof assisted reproduction techniques, and the formation\nof dedicated earlypregnancyunits for themanagement\nof pregnancy loss all represent recent advances and are\nlikely to affect outcomes.However, as thewomen in all\nthe interpregnancy interval groups were identified\nfrom the same period, and the year of occurrence of\nthe first pregnancy event was included as a covariate\nin the model, this is unlikely to have produced a signif-\nicant effect on the results. We also looked for inter-\naction of interpregnancy intervals over time, but this\nwas only found to be statistically significant in some\nwomen who had a second miscarriage.\nAdditionally, this study examined miscarriages that\nled to hospital contact only, and results therefore can-\nnot be generalised to all women with a miscarriage.\nHowever, most women in Scotland who are aware\nthat they havemiscarried are likely to attend hospitals.\nMoreover, there is a possibility that adverse second\npregnancy outcomes may be over-represented in our\nsample as women who were pregnant for the first time\ntowards the latter part of the study period may have\nhad a second pregnancy of normal duration. These\nwomen will have been missed as they had no reason\nto have any hospital admissions at that time. The\ncauses of miscarriages in the second trimester are dif-\nferent from those in the first, which are more common\nand can be missed. We therefore did a subgroup ana-\nlysis onwomenwith an initial second trimester miscar-\nriage (data not shown) and found that the results were\nconsistent with the findings of this study. Unrecorded\nmiscarriages could also result in misclassification bias\nin our estimates of interpregnancy intervals.13 We are\nalso uncertain whether the intervals between pregnan-\ncies were voluntary or not. Women taking longer to\nconceive may be more likely to have worse pregnancy\nTable 5 | Crude and adjusted odds ratios for complications in second pregnancy after initial miscarriage\nComplications in second ongoing\npregnancy\nInterpregnancy interval (months)\n<6 12-18 18-24 >24\nPre-eclampsia:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 1.04 (0.89 to 1.21) 1.19 (0.95 to 1.49) 1.10 (0.84 to 1.43) 1.05 (0.87 to 1.27)\nAdjusted* odds ratio (95% CI) 1.18 (0.82 to 1.23) 1.19 (0.96 to 1.49) 1.10 (0.84 to 1.44) 1.05 (0.87 to 1.28)\nPlacenta praevia:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.85 (0.61 to 1.20) 1.08 (0.66 to 1.76) 1.42 (0.85 to 2.37) 1.03 (0.68 to 1.55)\nAdjusted* odds ratio (95% CI) 0.89 (0.63 to 1.24) 1.06 (0.65 to 1.72) 1.38 (0.82 to 2.30) 0.97 (0.64 to 1.48)\nPlacental abruption:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.87 (0.75 to 1.02) 1.06 (0.84 to 1.33) 1.11 (0.85 to 1.45) 1.08 (0.89 to 1.30)\nAdjusted* odds ratio (95% CI) 0.87 (0.75 to 1.02) 1.04 (0.82 to 1.31) 1.11 (0.85 to 1.45) 1.10 (0.91 to 1.34)\nInduction of labour:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 1.07 (1.00 to 1.15) 1.04 (0.94 to 1.16) 1.20 (1.06 to 1.36) 1.04 (0.95 to 1.14)\nAdjusted*\u2020 odds ratio (95% CI) 1.08 (1.02 to 1.23) 0.96 (0.85 to 1.09) 1.05 (0.89 to 1.23) 0.94 (0.82 to 1.08)\nCaesarean delivery:\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.91 (0.84 to 0.98) 1.07 (0.95 to 1.20) 0.98 (0.85 to 1.13) 1.23 (1.12 to 1.36)\nAdjusted*\u2021 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.90 (0.83 to 0.98) 1.08 (0.96 to 1.23) 0.96 (0.80 to 1.16) 1.39 (1.26 to 1.54)\nPreterm delivery (<36 weeks):\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.88 (0.78 to 0.99) 1.05 (0.89 to 1.25) 1.01 (0.82 to 1.23) 1.34 (1.17 to 1.53)\nAdjusted*\u00a7 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.89 (0.81 to 0.98) 1.07 (0.93 to 1.23) 1.05 (0.88 to 1.24) 1.21 (1.07 to 1.36)\nVery preterm delivery (<32 weeks):\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.88 (0.70 to 1.11) 1.26 (0.91 to 1.76) 1.17 (0.80 to 1.73) 1.63 (1.26 to 2.10)\nAdjusted*\u00a7 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.92 (0.77 to 1.10) 1.23 (0.97 to 1.58) 1.01 (0.75 to 1.37) 1.40 (1.11 to1.70)\nLow birth weight (<2500 g):\nCrude odds ratio (95% CI) 0.70 (0.61 to 0.79) 0.86 (0.73 to 1.01) 1.00 (0.82 to 1.22) 1.22 (1.08 to 1.37)\nAdjusted*\u00b6 odds ratio (95% CI) 0.84 (0.71 to 0.89) 1.17 (0.93 to 1.47) 0.92 (0.69 to 1.21) 1.23 (1.02 to 1.48)\nReference category was interpregnancy interval of 6-12 months.\n*Adjusted for maternal age at first pregnancy, Carstairs social deprivation category, and year of first miscarriage.\n\u2020Also adjusted for pre-eclampsia and placental abruption.\n\u2021Also adjusted for pre-eclampsia, placenta praevia, and placental abruption.\n\u00a7Also adjusted for pre-eclampsia, placenta praevia, placental abruption, and induction of labour.\n\u00b6Also adjusted for gestation at delivery.\nRESEARCH\npage 6 of 8 BMJ | ONLINE FIRST | bmj.com\noutcomes owing to factors causing a delay in fertility\nrather than the interpregnancy interval itself.\nIt should also bementioned that the Scottish popula-\ntion is a relatively homogeneous, stable population.\nAlthough this may help reveal differences that may\nnot surface in a heterogeneous society, it means that\nthe results of this study may not be generalised to\nother populations.

The ability to adjust for\nadditional confounding factors such as ethnicity,\nchange of partner, maternal weight, and separation of\nvoluntary from involuntary interpregnancy intervals\nwould lend credibility to future research.\nImplications for clinical practice\nOur research shows that it is unnecessary for women to\ndelay conception after a miscarriage. As such the cur-\nrentWHOguidelinesmay need to be reconsidered. In\naccordance with our results, women wanting to\nbecome pregnant soon after a miscarriage should not\nbe discouraged. There may be cases where a delay is\ndesirable, for example if there are signs of infection,\nand women should be advised appropriately. Also, in\na molar pregnancy, current guidelines advise delaying\nthe next pregnancy for at least one year after\ntreatment.28\nAfter a miscarriage, women should also be coun-\nselled about how to optimise their own health before\nand during pregnancy in preparation for subsequent\nconception. The potential negative effects of delaying\nthe next pregnancy formore than18-24months should\nalso be discussed with couples, allowing them to make\na fully informed decision about future pregnancy.\nConclusion\nIn the Scottish population, women who conceive\nwithin six months of an initial miscarriage have the\nbest outcomes and lowest complication rates in their\nsubsequent pregnancy.\nWe thank Joanne Hatty for extraction of data from the Scottish morbidity\nrecords databases and Jill Mollison for statistical advice on the revised\nversion of this paper.\nContributors:ERL analysed the data and wrote the first draft of the paper.\nSohB extracted data and supervised the data analysis and writing of the\nfirst draft of the paper.
