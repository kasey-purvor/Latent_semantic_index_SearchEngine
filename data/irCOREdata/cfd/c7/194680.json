Rawlings*a\nReceived (in Cambridge, UK) 30th November 2004, Accepted 8th February 2005\nFirst published as an Advance Article on the web 17th February 2005\nDOI: 10.1039\/b418035f\n6-Benzoyl-3,4-dihydro-(2H)-pyran will protect 1,2,3-triols such\nas glycerol as their corresponding spiro-[5-phenyl-3,6,8-triox-\nabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-4,29-tetrahydropyran]s and 1,2,4-triols\n(less efficiently) as the corresponding trioxabicyclo[3.2.2]no-\nnanes; the hexol mannitol is converted into the corresponding\nbis-protected product.\nKetones (or gem-dimethoxyalkanes) can react with 1,2 or 1,3-diols\nwith acid catalysis to form acetals, and dihydropyrans react with\nalcohols under similar conditions to form tetrahydropyrans. Ley\nand co-workers recently introduced bis-dihydropyrans to protect a\nwide range of 1,2-diols as their dispiroketals, the products being\nformed were those with maximum anomeric stabilisation at newly\nformed centres.1 The Ley group has exploited the rigid architecture\nof these \u2018bispoke\u2019 derivatives in subsequent asymmetric reactions,2\nand exploited the bispoke derivatives of vicinal equatorial\ncarbohydrate diols to tune glycoside reactivity.3 Ley and co-\nworkers have also developed 1,2-diketones (as 1,1,2,2-\ntetramethoxy derivatives) as 1,2-diol protecting groups, forming\nin acidic methanol the corresponding 2,3-dimethoxy-1,4-dioxane.4\nReaction with glycerol gave triol protection resulting in 2-meth-\noxy-3,7,8-trioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane. Reaction with vicinal equa-\ntorial carbohydrate diols resulted in a glycosidation reactivity\ntuning effect between that of the corresponding benzylated and\nbenzoylated systems.5\nIn contrast to that of diols, the protection of triols has been\nneglected. In this paper, we combine the protecting capability of\ndihydropyran and a carbonyl group in a single molecule to\nprotect triols.\n6-Benzoyl-3,4-dihydro-(2H)-pyran 1 can be conveniently pre-\npared in large multigramme quantities.6 Addition of tert-butyl\nlithium (34 mmol) to 3,4-dihydro-(2H)-pyran (33 mmol) at220 uC\nforms the vinyl anion. Cooling to 278 uC followed by addition of\nN,N-dimethylbenzamide (31 mmol) and warming to room\ntemperature gave a crude product (.95% pure) that was adequate\nfor subsequent reactions, and could be kept in the fridge for weeks.\nInitial experiments involved the reaction of 1 with glycerol and\ncamphorsulfonic acid (CSA) in toluene under Dean and Stark\nconditions which gave two products, the expected trioxabicyclo-\n[3.2.1]octane 2,7 and a second compound whose spectral\ncharacteristics were consistent with a 2,5,7-trioxabicyclo[2,2,2]-\noctane. However reaction of glycerol (2.7 mmol), CSA (5.5 mmol),\ntrimethylorthoformate (5.5 mmol) and 1 (5.5 mmol) in refluxing\n(12 h) methanol (\u2018orthoformate\u2019 conditions) rapidly formed a\nsingle racemic crystalline triol protected product\n(1R,4(29)S,5S)-spiro[5-phenyl-3,6,8-trioxabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-4,29-\ntetrahydropyran] 2 in good yield (42%) (Scheme 1). In the product,\n2, the tetrahydropyranyl oxygen is axial relative to the 1,4-dioxane\nchair due to the anomeric effect, as shown in the X-ray structure\n(Fig. 1). Refluxing 2 in aqueous acid led to the recovery of 1.\n{ Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: experimental and\nX-ray diffraction data.

Derivatisation\nof the major isomer to the 4-nitrobenzoate and analysis by X-ray\ncrystallography showed that the remaining hydroxymethyl\ngroup was attached to C-2. This equatorial hydroxymethyl\ngroup could be converted into the corresponding bromide\n(PPh3, CBr4), or oxidised (Swern conditions) to the aldehyde\nand reacted with Grignard or Wittig reagents, or the\nalcohol converted into an alkene in one pot using manganese\ndioxide and the Wittig reagent.8 Refluxing 4 in water\u2013THF with\nCSA led to the recovery of erythritol (as the tetraacetate) in\n75% yield.\nReaction of 1 with the meso-pentol xylitol under the\northoformate conditions gave two isomeric products 5 and 6.\nDerivatisation of the isomer 6 to the bis-4-nitrobenzoate followed\nby X-ray crystallography showed that 6 had the residual 1,2-\ndihydroxyethyl group attached to C-7.\nX-Ray analysis of the bis-4-nitrobenzoate derivative of 7\nshowed that reaction of 1 with d-gluconolactone gave methoxy-\ncarbonyl 7, where reaction had occurred on the three terminal\nhydroxyl groups of the open chain form.\nThe reaction with D-(+)-mannitol under \u2018orthoformate\u2019 condi-\ntions gave the fully protected highly crystalline product 8 in 40%\nyield (Fig. 3).\nReaction with the 5-epimer of mannitol, D-sorbitol, gave a\ncomplex mixture, as did reactions attempted with molecules\nonly containing secondary alcohols. However, reaction with 1,1,1-\ntris(hydroxymethyl)ethane gave a product (5%) whose\nspectral characteristics were consistent with the expected\ntrioxabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane 9.\nIn these preliminary studies, a convenient procedure for the\nprotection of triols has been developed, that should prove valuable\nin synthesis of highly functionalised polyhydroxylated natural\nproducts, desymmetrisation of meso-polyols and the synthesis of\nisotopically labelled compounds.\nCaroline D.
