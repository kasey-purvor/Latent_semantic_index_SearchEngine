In spite\nof significant progress in its clinical management, com-\nparatively little is known about the aetiology of the dis-\nease and predicting outcome is still a challenge for most\nclinicians. Histopathologically, CaP displays considerable\nheterogeneity and can contain a substantial admixture of\npre-malignant HPIN glands within cancerous foci. HPIN\nis currently considered to be the most likely precursor to\ninvasive CaP [1]. However, most of these foci are latent\nand rarely develop into clinically detectable cancer.\nUnfortunately, a significant number (3%) do progress\nand can become aggressive and lethal [2]. The major diffi-\nculty facing clinicians is the identification of patients pre-\nsenting with early stage CaP, who are likely to develop\nlife-threatening disease. As a result, intensive research is\ncurrently underway to identify the key alterations that\nmay prove to be important for both classification and\nprognosis prediction.\nThe advent and development of CGH, which started in the\nearly 1990's [3], has revolutionised cytogenetics and\nallowed for genome-wide screening of numerous cancer\ntypes and the identification of genomic CNA, which may\ncontribute to cancer development and progression. The\naccumulation of genetic changes that occurs during the\nstepwise evolution from normal tissue to metastasis,\nalthough likely due to increased genetic instability, may\nindicate the chromosomal locations of TSG or oncogenes\nthat are important in tumourigenesis. When first intro-\nduced, CGH used metaphase chromosomes targets to\nidentify CNAs. However, recent advances have substituted\nthese with arrayed DNA sequences that provide higher res-\nolution, 1 Mb versus 10 Mb, and greater ease of analysis.\nWhole genome scans of CaP patients and cell lines have\nidentified consistent, chromosomal alterations, which\ninclude recurrent loss of chromosomal regions from 5p,\n6q, 8p, 10q, 13, 16q and 17p, in addition to gain on 1q,\n3q 7p, 7q, 8q 11p, 17q and Xpq [4-6]. Nonetheless, one\npotential limitation with current CGH methodology is its\nrequirement for microgram quantities of genomic DNA.\nWhen studying cell lines this is not necessarily a matter for\nconcern, as it is relatively straightforward to produce a suf-\nficient quantity of clonal cells to obtain many micrograms\nof DNA. However, when studying patient tissue if DNA is\n\"bulk extracted\" from a heterogeneous non-clonal\ntumour mass the data obtained will represent an average\nvalue for all cells within the specimen and any clinically\ninformative genetic changes, restricted to small cell clus-\nters, may be masked. As a result, when studying a hetero-\ngeneous tissue, such as prostate, it is essential to obtain\npure cell populations via methods such as macrodissec-\ntion or LCM. The DNA extracted from the dissected mate-\nrial can then be amplified using a whole genome\namplification (WGA) technique [7], such as MDA [8-11].\nThe combination of LCM and WGA can generate suffi-\ncient amounts of DNA for extensive genome analyses.\nSeveral large studies have demonstrated the ability of\nMDA to accurately amplify human genomic DNA. When\nused in SNP genotyping [12,13] an estimated 99.82% of\nthe genome is covered with a reported concordance, to\nnon-amplified DNA, of greater than 99% [14]. In addi-\ntion, the sequence error rate is only 7.6 \u00d7 106 [13] and pre-\nvious results obtained from gaCGH, using amplified\nDNA, are almost indistinguishable from those obtained\nfrom non-amplified DNA [10,15].\nAn understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind\ncancer development will enable identification of molecu-\nlar and cytogenetic biomarker(s) that may be useful in\npredicting early transformation into an aggressive pheno-\ntype, as well as, providing fundamental insights into the\nregulatory pathways of genome  integrity that may lead to\nmultistep field cancerization and HPIN and CaP. In the\npresent study, we describe the use of LCM, MDA and\ngaCGH, using a 1 Mb array (Spectral Genomics, USA) to\ninvestigate copy number changes occurring in prostate\ncancer by the analysis of 7 prostatic samples containing\nHPIN and 8 CaP specimens.\nResults\nTo determine whether whole genomic amplification\nexhibited bias or a distortion of imbalance assignments,\ncontrol CGH experiments comparing the results obtained\nbefore and after amplification (normal male versus nor-\nmal male, normal male versus normal female and DNA\nfrom a cancer cell line versus normal control DNA) from\nthe same original DNA samples were performed. These\nare presented in Additional Files 1, 2, 3 and it is evident\nthat no major distortion of imbalance was introduced by\namplification of genomic DNA.\nA summary of the chromosomal CNAs detected by CGH\nfor the 7 HPIN and 8 CaP samples is shown in Table 1 and\n2 and displayed graphically in Figure 1 (for HPIN blue =\nloss, yellow = gain; for CaP red = loss, green = gain). Figure\n2 shows the frequency of CNAs detected at the level of\neach chromosomes arm for HPIN and CaP. The general\npattern of loss or gain was very similar in the HPIN and\nCaP samples, however CaP samples possessed signifi-\ncantly more aberrations (90 CNAs) than HPIN samples\n(41 CNAs) (P<0.001, chi square test). The average\nnumber of CNAs for the 7 HPIN samples was 5.8 (range 3\nto 8, median 6). For the 8 CaP samples an average of\n11.25 (range 5 to 18, median 11.5) amplifications or dele-\ntions were observed. When studied at the 850 cytoband\nlevel (minus X and Y chromosome cytobands), HPINPage 2 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2006, 7:65 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/7\/65samples had the total of 65 affected bands (average 9,\nrange 4 to 14) and CaP samples 143 affected breakpoints\nbands (average 18, range 8 to 27). This difference is statis-\ntically significant (P<0.001, chi square test). In addition,\nfor both the HPIN and CaP samples there were a signifi-\ncantly greater number of cytobands lost than gained\n(P<0.01, chi squared test) (Table 1).\nIn the 7 HPIN samples recurrent chromosomal changes,\ndetected in greater  than 25% of cases, were losses found\non 8p (7 out of 7 cases, 100%), 6q,  13q, 16q (2 out of 7\ncases, 28.5%, each), whereas gains were found on 8q  and\n16p (3 out of 7 cases, 43%, each), 1p, 7p and 20q (2 out\nof 7 cases,  28.5%, each). For the 8 CaP samples recurrent\nchromosomal changes,  detected in greater than 25% of\ntumours, were losses on 8p (8 out of 8  cases, 100%), 10q\n(6 out of 8 cases, 75%), 13q (5 out of 8 cases,  62.5%), 6q\n(4 out of 8 cases, 50%), 1p, 16q (3 our of 8 cases, 37.5%),\n5q, 12p, 18q (2 out of 8 cases, 25%, each) and gains on\n7q (6 out of 8  cases, 75%), 7p, 8q (5 out of 8 cases,\n62.5%, each), 4p, 16p, 19p (2 out  of 8 cases, 25%).  \nSmall consensus regions of consistent CNA were observed\nfor both HPIN and CaP samples (Table 3), in >25% of\nsamples.

A list of the genes\npresent within these consensus or commonly lost regions\nis displayed in Table 3.\nDiscussion\nChromosome copy number abnormalities (CNAs) are\ncommon in most cancers, with specific regions of ampli-\nfication or deletion being associated with specific tumour\ntypes, stages or outcomes [16-18]. The introduction of\nmetaphase CGH [3] to study these CNAs has eliminated\nthe requirement to obtain metaphase spreads from the\ntumour samples, which was often challenging due to tech-\nnical difficulties in culturing certain tissues. Though met-\naphase CGH allows for more samples to be examined, it\nprovides a relatively limited resolution and still requires\nsubstantial cytogenetic experience to analyse the results.\nThe recent development of array CGH has opened up the\nfield of CGH research and permitted more laboratories to\nstudy an ever-increasing number of tumour types and\nstages. The application of BAC microarrays to analyse\nhuman samples is straightforward and their high-\nthroughput nature makes them the method of choice for\nrapid detection of genetic alterations.\nWhen analysing heterogeneous tumour samples, the\ngaCGH results obtained from \"bulk extracted\" DNA are\nlikely to be inaccurate. However, with the use of LCM and\nMDA we have been to able obtain highly purified HPIN\nand CaP DNA and thus identify the particular chromo-\nsomal changes associated with the two disease stages.\nIn this study, we have used a 2,400-element BAC microar-\nray with a resolution of ~1 Mb to study CNAs in a set of\n15 patient samples comprised of 7 HPIN cases and 8 CaP\ncases. For the 7 HPIN cases, 41 genomic alterations (20\ngains, 21 losses) were identified, in contrast to the 90\ngenomic alterations (38 gains, 52 losses) seen for the 8\nCaP cases. As with other cancers, CaP development and\nprogression is likely to be the outcome of a series of step-\nwise genetic changes. The accumulation of CNAs, which\noccurs during this process, although likely due to\nincreased genetic instability, is non-random and may\nindicate chromosomal regions important in tumourigen-\nesis. It is suggested that failure in the fidelity of homolo-\ngous recombination within the repetitive sequences, that\ncomprise the kinetochore complex, could lead to recur-\nrent loss of 8p and gain of 8q by rearrangement of chro-\nmosome 8-specific alphoid centromeric sequences. Thus,\nthe high fidelity process of homologous recombination\ncan be the major DNA repair pathway, which is indispen-\nsable for the maintenance of genetic stability.\nExamination of our array results indicates that aberrations\ninvolving parts or all of 1p, 6q, 7p, 7q, 8p, 8q, 10q, 13q\n16p and 16q are most common, which is concordant with\nTable 2: Chromosomal changes in microdissected HPIN and CaP DNA samples.\nTumour Type Loss Gain\nCaP 2-02 HPIN 3q13.33-q21.1; 6p24.1-pter; 8p11.1-p23.2; 13q14.3-q31.2 1p21.3-p31.1; 2q24.3-q31.1; 8q23.3-qter; 11p14.3-p15.1\nCaP 5-02 HPIN 6q14.1-q16.3; 8p23.1-pter; 16q21-qter 1p22.3-p31.1; 7p15.1-p15.3; 8q13.3-qter\nCaP 24-01 HPIN 2p23.1-p25.2; 4q22.1-q34.1; 8p11.23-pter 3q21.2-q24; 12q14.3-q21.33\nCaP 37-02 HPIN 8p23.1-pter; 7p22.1-pter; 20q11.22-q13.11\nCaP 70-01 HPIN 6q16.3-q22.1; 8p11.21-pter; 13q13.1-q14.3 7p21.3-p22.1; 8q21.11-qter; 16p12.3-pter; 20q11.23-q13.2\nCaP 74-01 HPIN 8p21.1-pter; 10q21.3-q23.1; 18q21.32-q22.2; 21q21.3-qter 7q32.3-q36.1; 16p12.3-p13.13; 20p11.23-p12.1\nCaP 36-02 HPIN 8p11.23-pter; 10q23.31-q25.1; 16q22.1-qter 16p12.2-pter; 17q24.2-qter\nCaP 7-99 Cancer 2q14.2-q21.2; 5q14.1-q22.1; 6q16.1-q21; 8p21.3-p23.1; \n10q22.1-q23.33; 13q14.11-q22.2\n4q21.21-q21.23; 7p15.3-p21.3; 7q11.23\nCaP 7-01 Cancer 1p21.1-p32.3; 2q33.1-q33.3; 5q14.1-q21.3; 6q16.1-q22.1; \n8p11.23-pter; 10q23.31-qter; 13q12.13-q14.11\n4p13-p15.1; 4q22.2-q24; 7q31.1-qter; 8q21.11-qter; 9p22.3-\np24.1; 14q13.1-q21.3\nCaP 7-02 Cancer 2q24.2-q31.1; 7q22.3-qter; 8p11.22-pter; 10q22.2-q23.33; \n18q11.1-q22.3\nCaP 11-01 Cancer 8p11.21-pter; 10q22.2-q23.33; 12p13.2; 13q13.3-q32.2; \n16q24.1-qter; 22q11.21-qter\n1q32.1; 5q14.2-q14.3; 8q13.3-q21.2\nCaP 11-02 Cancer 1p13.1-p13.2; 1p22.3; 2p16.3; 6q12-q16.1; 8p21.1-pter; \n10q25.3-q26.11\n7p22.1-pter; 7q11.23; 8q22.3-qter; 16p12.2-pter; 19p; \n19q13.33-qter\nCaP 14-00 Cancer 6p24.1-pter; 8p11.21-pter; 10q23.31-q23.32; 15q22.33-q24.1 1p21.3-p32.1; 3q25.33-q27.3; 4p13-p15.1; 4q13.1-q13.3; \n7p15.3-p22.1; 7q21.11-q21.3; 7q31.1-q31.33; 8q11.22-qter; \n11q14.1-14.3\nCaP 14-02 Cancer 1p13.1-p13.2; 1p22.3; 6q16.1-q16.3; 8p21.2-p23.1; 8q12-qter; \n10q21.1-q21.2; 10q23.1-q23.32; 10q25.2-q26.11; 11q22.3-\nqter; 12p13.2; 13q12.3-q21.33; 15q13.1-q21.3; 16q12.2-qter\n7p22.1-pter; 7q11.23; 8p23.2-pter; 18q21.1; 20q11.21-q13.12\nCaP 32-02 Cancer 3q26.33-q27.3; 8p11.22-p23.2; 13q13.3-qter; 16q23.1-qter; \n18q21.33-q22.1\n1p35.2-p36.11; 7p22.1-p22.2; 7q11.23; 15q11.2-q22.32; \n16p12.2-13.11; 19p13.11-pterPage 4 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2006, 7:65 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/7\/65previous metaphase [19,20] and array CGH [4,21] results.\nIt is therefore likely that the alterations in copy number\nare part of a programmed cycle of events that promote\ntumour development and progression as well having an\nimpact on disease-specific survival.\nA comparison of the CNAs present in the HPIN and CaP\nsamples identified a significant increase in copy number\nfor 7q (P<0.01, chi square test) and a significantly\nincreased frequency of loss for 10q (P<0.01, chi square\ntest) and 13q (P<0.0001, chi square test). In genotype\/\nphenotype correlations, gain of chromosome 7q [22] and\nloss of 13q [23] have been associated with advancing\ntumour stage and aggressiveness, which is in agreement\nwith the results presented here. However, gain of 8q [24]\nand loss of 16q [25] have also been linked to tumour pro-\ngression, but our data do not show any significant differ-\nence for these CNAs in our HPIN and CaP samples. This\nwould suggest that 8q and 16q CNA's are likely to be early\nevents in tumourigenesis. In addition, they may also iden-\ntify HPIN and CaP samples that are likely to progress.\nApart from the commonly reported CNAs, additional\nalterations that have been less frequently reported in ear-\nlier CGH studies have also been identified. These include\ngains on 12q (HPIN) and loss of 4q and 10q (HPIN and\nCaP). Whether the identification of 12q and 4q regions\nwill provide additional insight into CaP progression is not\nyet clear.

The ability to distinguish these\nregions will point to genes, which may either directly\n(tumour suppressor gene loss or oncogene gain) or indi-\nrectly contribute to tumour development and progression.\nAs a result, CGH can be used as a surrogate for gene identi-\nfication. Candidate genes, which have previously been\nimplicated in CaP have been highlighted in bold in Table\n3. The roles of MYC [30-32], PSCA [33-35], and MDM2\n[36-38] have all been well reported and alterations in gene\ndosage correlate well with their change in expression.\nHowever, other candidate genes have been less well stud-\nied. For example, EBAG9, whose increased expression in\nCaP is a negative prognostic indicator, has a potential role\nin progression by enabling cancer cells to evade the\nimmune response [39]. NBS1, which has been identified as\na founder mutation causing an increased susceptibility to\nprostate cancer [40], is involved in processing\/repair of\nDNA double strand breaks and in cell cycle checkpoints,\nthus its deregulation will likely contribute to chromosomal\ninstability. FKHR, which is a member of the FOXO fork-\nhead transcription factor family, is thought to play a regu-\nlatory role in several cellular functions including cell\nproliferation and survival [41]. Loss of FKHR expression, as\nobserved in CaP cell lines, is likely to abrogate this control\nleading to tumour cell growth. Though these genes have\npreviously been implicated in CaP there are additional\ngenes, including both oncogenes and tumour suppressor\ngenes, which reside within all of the affected regions that\nmay play an important role in the aetiology of the disease.\nFurther analysis of these other candidates may identify\ntheir potential as molecular targets for diagnosis and treat-\nment.\nSeveral of the genes present within altered regions of the\ngenome are associated with genetic pathways, indicating\nthat these pathways are likely to be important in prostate\ntumourigenesis.\nConclusion\nThe combination of techniques used in this study has\nallowed for the identification of consistent regions of\ncopy number change, ranging from specific cytobands to\nwhole chromosomes, starting with as little as 5\u201310 ng of\nDNA. Through our use of LCM, we have also identified\nseveral lower frequency CNAs which may not have been\ndetected when using bulk extracted DNA due to the heter-\nogeneous nature of prostate tissue. In addition, several\ninteresting candidate genes have been observed within the\naltered chromosomal regions. Although some have\nalready been extensively studied others, which have not,\nmay prove to be of clinical importance. Genetic screening\nstrategies that combine FISH and immunohistochemistry\nfor the detection of various combinations of chromo-\nsomal gains and\/or losses and altered gene expression are\nlikely to be of great use in diagnosis and prognosis predic-\ntion.\nMethods\nTissue accrual\nFresh prostate tissue was obtained from radical prostatec-\ntomies performed at The University Health Network\n(UHN), Toronto, with the informed patient consent and\napproval of the institutional research ethics board. The tis-\nsue was embedded in OCT frozen section medium\n(Stephens Scientific, Riverdale NJ, USA) and stored at -\n80\u00b0C until required. For all samples, the presence of\nHPIN and CaP was verified by histologic assessment of\nfrozen sections by a urological pathologist (A.E.).\nCohort selection\nPatient samples for gaCGH analysis were selected based\non two criteria; first, the presence of clearly identifiable\nregions of HPIN and\/or CaP and second, the availability\nof good quality high molecular weight DNA. DNA quality\nwas assessed by DNA extraction from a single tissue sec-\ntion and visualisation by agarose gel electrophoresis. A\ncohort consisting of 15 cases (7 HPIN and 8 CaP derived\nfrom different patients) were selected based on these cri-\nteria.\nLaser capture microdissection\nThe selected fresh-frozen prostate tissue samples were cut\nonto microscope slides (8 \u00b5m thickness) and stained\nusing the HistoGene LCM frozen section staining kit (Arc-\nturus, USA). Foci of HPIN and CaP were identified from\nstained prostate tissue sections and a minimum of 1000\ncells were removed from these regions by LCM using the\nCell Robotics LaserScissors system (Cell Robotics Inc.,\nUSA).\nDNA extraction\nDNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit\n(Qiagen, USA) and the DNA concentration was deter-\nmined using the PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation kit\n(Molecular Probes Inc., USA). Both procedures were per-\nformed following manufacturers instructions.\nStrand displacement amplification\nDNA was amplified using the GenomiPhi Amplification\nKit (Amersham Biosciences, USA) according to manufac-\nturer's instructions. Briefly, amplification was carried out\nin two individual steps. The step 1 reaction mixture con-\ntained 5\u201310 ng (1000 to 2000 cell equivalents) of DNA\n(from diluted reference or test DNA) in 1 \u00b5l of sterile\nwater and 9 \u00b5l of Sample Buffer. This mixture was heated\nat 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes and then chilled on ice. The step 2\nreaction (amplification) mixture contained 9 \u00b5l of Reac-\ntion Buffer, 1 \u00b5l of Enzyme Mix and the 10 \u00b5l from Step\n1. The amplification reaction was incubated at 30\u00b0C forPage 7 of 10\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Genomics 2006, 7:65 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2164\/7\/6516\u201318 hours. The enzyme was inactivated by heating at\n65\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by cooling to 4\u00b0C. This\nmethod of WGA consistently produced in excess of 5 \u00b5g\nof DNA from a starting concentration of 5\u201310 ng.\nAssessment of DNA quality and strand displacement \namplification\nFive microlitres of each amplification reaction was electro-\nphoresed through a 1% agarose gel and stained with\nethidium bromide in order to assess product yield and\nproduct length. All amplification products were purified\nby phenol-chloroform extraction and DNA concentration\nand purity were determined by measuring absorbance at\nA260 and A280.\nSpectral genomic BAC arrays\nThe genomic DNA arrays used in these experiments were\nobtained from Spectral Genomics Inc. and consist of\napproximately 2400 unique BAC and PAC clones, which\nprovide an average genomic resolution of 1 Mb. CGH\nexperiments were performed using the amplified patient\nDNA as the \"test\" and amplified female placental DNA as\nthe \"normal\". In addition, control experiments were per-\nformed, corresponding to DNA before and after amplifi-\ncation (normal non-neoplastic prostate epithelial DNA\nversus normal non-neoplastic prostate epithelial DNA,\nnormal non-neoplastic prostate epithelial DNA versus\nnormal female placental DNA and DNA from a cancer cell\nline versus normal control DNA).\nReference DNA and test DNA were first digested overnight\nat 37\u00b0C using 10 units of RsaI (Invitrogen) in a 10 \u00b5l reac-\ntion. The digested DNA was labeled using the protocol\noptimized by Spectral Genomics, with separate labeling\nreactions for Cy3 and Cy5 being set up for both reference\nand test DNA. Briefly, labeling reaction were set up con-\ntaining 2 \u00b5g of DNA, 20 \u00b5l of 2.5\u00d7 random primer\/reac-\ntion buffer mix (Invitrogen) and sterile water up to a final\nvolume of 45 \u00b5l. The reaction mix was boiled for 5 min-\nutes prior to cooling on ice and the addition of 2.5 \u00b5l of\nSpectral labeling buffer (Spectral Genomics, Houston,\nU.S.A), 1.5 \u00b5l of either Cy3-dCTP (1mM, Applied Biosys-\ntems, Foster City, U.S.A) or Cy5-dCTP (1 mM, Applied\nBiosystems) and 1 \u00b5l of Klenow Fragment (BioPrime labe-\nling kit, Invitrogen). The reaction was mixed gently and\nthen incubated for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation\nthe reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 \u00b5l 0.5 M\nEDTA (pH8) and heating at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes.\nThe Cy3 labeled test DNA was combined with the Cy5\nlabeled normal reference DNA and vice versa. Each com-\nbined probe was mixed with 45 \u00b5l of Spectral Hybridisa-\ntion Buffer (Spectral Genomics), 11.3 \u00b5l of 5 M NaCl and\n110 \u00b5l of room temperature isopropanol. The samples\nwere incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10\u201315\nminutes and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 minutes and\nthe supernatant discarded. The pellets were then washed\nwith 500 \u00b5l of 70% ethanol. The supernatant was carefully\nremoved and the pellets air-dried at room temperature in\nthe dark. For hybridisation, the pellets were first resus-\npended in 10 \u00b5l of sterile water prior to being mixed with\n30 \u00b5l of Spectral Hybridisation Buffer II (Spectral Genom-\nics) by pipetting. The reconstituted probes were then incu-\nbated at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes, placed on ice for 5 minutes\nand then incubate for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. The probes\nwere hybridised to BAC arrays, covered with a 22 \u00d7 60 mm\ncoverslip and incubated for 12\u201316 hours at 37\u00b0C in a\nhumidified chamber.\nThe wash buffers, with the exception of Wash I, were pre-\nwarmed to 50\u00b0C. The slides were gently dipped into and\nout of Wash I (2\u00d7 SSC, 0.5% SDS) until the coverslip\ndetached from the slide. The slides were then washed once\nin Wash II (2 \u00d7 SSC, 50% deionized Formamide, pH 7.5)\nfor 20 minutes, followed by successive washes in Wash III\n(2\u00d7 SSC, 0.1% NP-40, pH 7.5) for 20 minutes and Wash\nIV (0.2\u00d7 SSC, pH 7.5) for 10 minutes. All washes were per-\nformed at 50\u00b0C, with the exception of Wash I. The slides\nwere briefly submerged in distilled deionized water for 5\u2013\n10 seconds and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 750 rpm to\ndry.\nData collection and analysis\nThe slides were scanned using an Axon GenePix 4000 A\nconfocal scanner, each fluorescence signal was collected\nseparately and quantified with the GenePix Pro 3.0 soft-\nware (Axon Instruments, U.S.A).
