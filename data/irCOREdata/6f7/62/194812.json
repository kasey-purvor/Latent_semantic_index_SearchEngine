They lie at projected\ngalactocentric distances of \u224815 to \u224835 kpc. These objects begin to fill the gap in parameter\nspace between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals, and are unlike any clusters found in\nthe Milky Way, or elsewhere to date. Colour\u2013magnitude diagrams, integrated photometric\nproperties and derived King profile fit parameters are given, and we discuss possible origins\nof these clusters and their relationships to other populations.\nKey words: galaxies: individual: M31 \u2013 galaxies: star clusters.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nOver the past several years we have undertaken a major survey\nof M31, which has revealed a wealth of unexpected substructure\n(Ferguson et al. 2002), the most prominent being a giant stream of\nstars near the minor axis (Ibata et al. 2001). As part of this study of\nM31, we have searched for globular clusters (GCs) in a large part\nof the halo. GC systems have been shown to be valuable tools for\nthe study of the evolution of their host galaxies, acting as chemical\nand dynamical probes (West et al. 2004). Specifically, most GCs\nare believed to be old objects, and thus provide clues to the earliest\nepochs of galaxy formation history.\nThe three clusters presented here were discovered during this\nsearch for classical GCs, whose results are more fully documented\nin another paper (Huxor et al., in preparation). While undertak-\ning aperture photometry of one of the GCs found, a diffuse cluster\nwas serendipitously discovered nearby in the same field (cluster 1,\nhereafter C1, in Fig. 1). The object was not classed as a single ob-\nject by the INT\u2013WFS (Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Survey)\npipeline (Irwin & Lewis 2001), and hence, had been missed by the\nsemi-automated techniques that we employed in the main GC sur-\nvey. It is very distinctive in being significantly more extended than\ntypical GCs: aperture photometry giving a half-light radius (Rh) of\n35 pc, assuming a distance to M31 of \u223c780 kpc (McConnachie\net al. 2005). We were therefore motivated to undertake a visual sur-\nvey of all the INT\u2013WFS images for the M31 region, which resulted\nin the discovery of two further objects with similar properties. In\n\u0001E-mail: ahuxor@star.herts.ac.uk\nthis paper we present the three clusters, which are unlike any found\naround the Milky Way (MW), M31 or indeed elsewhere to date,\nin that although many MW GCs have half-light radii approaching\n30 pc, they are faint. These new clusters, however, are of average\nGC luminosity.\n2 T H E N E W C L U S T E R S\nThe fields visually investigated include the whole INT\u2013WFS M31\nsurvey, an area far into the halo, and an additional region south along\nthe Andromeda Stream, and towards M33, making a total area of\nmore than 40 deg2 (see Fig. 2). The survey consists of V- and Gunn\ni-band images with exposures of between 800 and 1000 s, reaching\n(average 5\u03c3 ) limiting magnitudes of i = 23.5 and V = 24.5, and\ntaken in average seeing of 1.2 arcsec. These images were processed\nby the INT\u2013WFS pipeline provided by the Cambridge Astronomical\nSurvey Unit, which includes tools for astrometry, photometry and\nobject description and classification (Irwin & Lewis 2001).\nThe location of the clusters (star icons), in relation to M31 is\nshown in Fig. 2, while postage stamp images (1 \u00d7 1 arcmin2) of the\nclusters are shown in Fig. 1. The clusters appear, in projection, to\ncover a range of environments, from the far halo (C2), to near the\ndisc (C3; though we note that if C3 is a disc object, it lies at a very\nlarge radius of 27 kpc).\nThe positions of the three extended GCs were cross-checked\nagainst existing catalogues starting with the GC lists of Barmby\n(http:\/\/cfa-www.harvard.edu\/\u223cpbarmby\/m31gc.html; Barmby et al.\n2000) and the newly published Revised Bologna Catalog\n(http:\/\/www.bo.astro.it\/M31\/; Galleti et al. 2004).

V- and i-band images of the new luminous \u2018extended\u2019 clusters,\nfrom the INT\u2013WFS images. Each image is 1 \u00d7 1 arcmin2, with north up\nand east to the left. Cluster 3 is a partial image as it lies on the edge of an\nINT\u2013WFS field.\ndata bases such as Vizier (Ochsenbein, Bauer & Marcout 2000) and\nNED (http:\/\/nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu\/index.html) were consulted\nfor any prior identifications. C1, the richest cluster, has previously\nbeen catalogued from a large-scale survey as a background low sur-\nface brightness galaxy, object N04-1 of O\u2019Neil, Bothun & Cornell\n(1997). However, the INT\u2013WFS survey image clearly shows it to\nbe a resolved star cluster.\nColour\u2013magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the clusters (see Figs 3\u2013\n5) were made from the INT\u2013WFS images by performing DAOPHOT\n(IRAF implementation) profile-fitting photometry on the regions of\nthe images containing the clusters. This level of crowding is an ideal\napplication of profile-fitting photometry, and the large number of\nbright stars on the images allows a good PSF model to be constructed\nin each case. The resulting CMDs are fully consistent with metal-\npoor, old stellar populations at the distance of M31. There is no\nevidence for a population of young main sequence stars at these\nlocations. The integrated (V \u2212 I )0 colours are also consistent with\nlow metallicity (Worthey 1994) if indeed they are an old population.\nTable 1 lists the basic integrated properties of the clusters: mag-\nnitudes were derived at 12 arcsec, and (V \u2212 I ) at the smaller radius\nof 8 arcsec (but no smaller owing to the clumpiness of the clusters).\nPrior to undertaking the aperture photometry analysis of the clus-\nters, bright stars (i.e. with i \u2032 < 20) were automatically clipped out\nFigure 2. The location of the new extended GCs (stars) in relation to major\nlandmarks of the M31 system (open circles), and the survey area (dotted\noutline, red in electronic version). The ellipses represent a 2\u25e6 radius disc\naligned and tilted to the inclination of M31 and an oblate halo of axial ratio\n0.6 aligned along the major axis. The kpc scales correspond to a distance to\nM31 of 780 kpc.\nof the images and replaced with a local background estimate using\nthe existing WFS object catalogues to drive the clipping algorithm.\nThe INT\u2013WFS data were taken with Harris V (V \u2032) and Sloan\u2013\nGunn i\u2032 filters. The colour transformations applied to determine\nLandolt (1992) Johnson V and Cousins I magnitudes were I = i \u2032 \u2212\n0.101(V \u2212 I ) and V = V \u2032 \u2212 0.005(V \u2212 I ).\nEmpirical King profiles\n\u0003(r ) = \u00030\n[\n1(\n1 + (r\/rc)2\n)1\/2 \u2212 1(1 + (rt\/rc)2)1\/2\n]2\nwere fit to the aperture photometry, from which Rh and the derived\nparameters listed in Table 2 were determined (Fig. 6). There are\nsome uncertainties associated with the values: in the case of C2,\nlikely foreground contamination from stars was removed first. The\ncluster C3 lies at the edge of the INT field but the fractional area\nmissing is small allowing us to obtain photometry only to a radius\nof 13 arcsec.\n3 D I S C U S S I O N\nThese objects are unusual because, whilst all three clusters have\nmagnitudes and colours typical of the M31 GC population, their\nhalf-light radii (Rh) are considerably greater.

A CMD for C1 (filled points are within 20 arcsec of the cluster\ncentre) and surrounding field (open points are within a 130-arcsec square\nregion around the cluster). Photometry was obtained using DAOPHOT (IRAF\nimplementation) profile fitting, and has been corrected for foreground extinc-\ntion via Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). Overplotted are isochrones\nfor galactic GCs from Da Costa & Armandroff (1990) shifted to an M31\ndistance modulus of \u00b50 = 24.47 and representing a range of metallicities,\nfrom left to right: [Fe\/H] = \u22122.17 (M15); \u22121.91 (NGC 6397); \u22121.58 (M2);\n\u22121.29 (NGC 1851) and \u22120.71 (47 Tuc). The RGB locus of the C1 is clearly\ndelineated, and consistent with an old, metal-poor population at the distance\nof M31.\nthere are several GCs (which are also generally at large Galactocen-\ntric radius) with half-light radii in excess of 15 pc, but these MW\nclusters are considerably fainter, and rather more compact, than\nthe newly found clusters in M31. The very distant, and extended,\nGalactic globular NGC 2419 stands as a notable exception, being\nconsiderably more luminous. Conversely the newly discovered ex-\ntreme MW cluster (Willman et al. 2004) has similar half-light radius\nbut is some 4 mag fainter.\nThe distinction between different types of stellar cluster is becom-\ning increasingly complex, with even the boundary between open and\nGCs sometimes being blurred. Borderline objects have been identi-\nfied, such as BH 176 (Ortolani, Bica & Barbuy 1995) which could\nbe a true GC or a very old open cluster. The situation is complicated\nfurther by \u03c9 Cen, which although long classified as a GC, has many\nunusual features, such as a wide metallicity spread of its component\nstars (Suntzeff & Kraft 1996), a characteristic shared by the bright\nM31 GC G1 (Meylan et al. 2001).\nMore recently, new classes of object have been identified which\nbegin to fill in the gap in the parameter space between classical\nFigure 4. CMD for C2, similar to Fig. 3, but in this case the radius used to\ndefine the cluster region was 14 arcsec. Although fewer points, a reasonably\nclear (metal-poor) sequence is seen.\nGCs and dwarf galaxies. For example, Mieske, Hilker & Infante\n(2002) measured the properties of ultracompact objects (UCOs)\n[or ultracompact dwarfs (UCDs)] in the Fornax cluster, which\nare as bright as dwarf ellipticals but very much more compact.\nMartini & Ho (2004) describe a population of very massive GCs in\nNGC 5128, whose properties overlap with those of nucleated dwarfs\nand UCDs. At the fainter end of the luminosity scale Brodie &\nLarsen (2002) described a new class of star cluster found in Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) studies of two lenticular galaxies, NGC 1023\nand 3384, lying at distances of \u223c10 Mpc. These clusters occupy a\nregion of parameter space having an absolute V magnitude fainter\nthan \u2248 \u22127, a half-light radius greater than 7\u201315 pc, and have been\nchristened \u2018faint fuzzies\u2019 (FFs).\nThe relationship between all these object types, and MW and M31\ndwarf spheroidals (dSph) galaxies is illustrated in Fig. 7. The new\nextended clusters are shown (solid circles), along with MW GCs\nfrom van den Bergh (1996), dSphs associated with the MW (Irwin\n& Hatzidimitriou 1995), the dSphs associated with M31 (Caldwell\net al. 1992; Caldwell 1999) and G1 (Larsen 2001). The region that\nwould be occupied by the FFs is to to the right of, and above, the\ndotted lines on the plot (although they are distinguished from the\nmore diffuse MW GCs in terms of their numbers, higher metallicities\nand discy kinematics).\nIn terms of morphology and luminosity the new extended clus-\nters are rather more extended and more luminous the FFs (al-\nthough the magnitudes of the latter may well be underestimates by\nC\u00a9 2005 RAS, MNRAS 360, 1007\u20131012\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1010 A.

In this case the quality of the image\nwas poorer, and the crowding due to M31 disc\/spheroid stars much worse.\nNonetheless, the very blue (metal-poor) RGB locus of the cluster is clearly\nseen.\nseveral tenths of a magnitude owing to the aperture corrections cho-\nsen for photometry). Furthermore, the FFs of Brodie and Larsen are\nmoderately metal rich [Fe\/H] \u223c \u22120.6, and consequently have red\nintegrated colours, (V \u2212 I )0 of \u22481.3.\nLooking more broadly at Fig. 7 we see a variety of objects in the\nregion between classical GCs and dSphs. A number of origins have\nbeen proposed to explain the intermediate forms. Zhao (1998) has\nproposed that NGC 2419, the unusual MW GC, with a half-light\nradius of \u224819 pc may have been accreted from a putative \u2018Ancient\nSagittarius Galaxy\u2019, along with some of the fainter GCs: Terzan\n7, Arp 2, Terzan 8 (which are part of the main body of Sgr) and\nPal15. One might therefore speculate that these new M31 objects\nTable 1. Properties of the extended clusters. Rh is the half-light radius calculated assuming a distance to M31 of 780 kpc,\nwhich is also used the determination of absolute magnitude. It is not easy to determine accurate uncertainties on the values\nof Rh, given the sparseness of the clusters, and the necessity to account for foreground and background contamination,\nhowever, we estimate the accuracy to be better than \u224820 per cent. Extinction corrected magnitudes use the Schlegel et al.\n(1998) maps.\nID RA (J2000) Dec.

However, we should point out that by no means are all dwarf\ngalaxy GCs unusually extended.\nOther possible scenarios to form extended clusters involve either\nstripping of dwarfs to form smaller systems, or the merger of star\nclusters to form larger systems. For example, both G1 and \u03c9 Cen\nGCs are unique, with suggestions that they are the cores of stripped\ndwarfs (Bekki & Freeman 2003; Bekki & Chiba 2004; Ideta &\nMakino 2004; Tsuchiya, Korchagin & Dinescu 2004). Martini &\nHo (2004) speculate that owing to the presence of extratidal light,\nthat some of their massive GCs in NGC 5128 may be the nuclei\nof stripped dwarfs.

The M31 dSph, AndIX, is also included, using an exponential fit to the radial profile determined by us from the INT\u2013WFS catalogues\nand using the luminosity from Zucker et al. (2004). In addition the line of the equation logRh = 0.2MV + 2.6 is plotted (solid line, from van den Bergh &\nMackey 2004), and that for a value of constant average surface brightness within Rh (dashed line) illustrating one selection effect. The dotted L-shape indicates\nthe region where FFs are found. The Galactic GCs \u03c9 Cen and NGC 2419 are also labelled.\nRabolli (1994) suggest that the nuclei of dwarf nucleated galaxies\nsurvive encounters with a giant galaxy, and they propose that such\na scenario may explain the large number of GCs in many galaxies.\nDepending on the characteristics of the progenitor dwarf, and of\nthe encounter orbit, a range of remnant clusters can be produced.\nIn their models, the surviving clusters are more massive and have\nlarger tidal radii than GCs (or our new extended clusters). However,\nthey suggest that more concentrated nuclei and closer encounters\nwith the centre of the giant galaxy might produce more compact\nclusters, such as GCs. Indeed, it has been proposed that M54 is the\nnucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf (Bassino & Muzzio 1995, but see\nMonaco et al. 2005 for a contrary view).\nSuch a scenario has important implications. For example, it has\nbeen suggested that if, as postulated, all galaxies have central black\nholes, such stripped objects should have black holes at their cores,\nand (Gebhardt, Rich & Ho 2002) report to have found evidence,\nalbeit controversial, for such a black hole in G1. It is also believed\nthat GCs, unlike dSphs, do not possess a dark matter halo, leaving\nopen the question of the dark matter content for any intermediate\nforms, such as those listed above. However, Bekki & Chiba (2004)\nfound that any progenitor dwarf would have to have had its DM halo\nstripped to form a G1-like cluster.\nIt has been argued that G1 and \u03c9 Cen can be better explained as\nthe product of merger events. For example, Baumgardt et al. (2003)\npropose a model for G1 involving merger of two smaller GCs (and\nargue that there is no need to invoke a central BH). Fellhauer (2004)\nhas suggested that \u03c9 Cen could be the product of a merger of \u2018super\nstar clusters\u2019, themselves created in a starburst event triggered by\nthe accretion of a dwarf satellite, which derives its diverse stellar\npopulation by capturing old field stars from the dwarf. Furthermore,\nbecause the progenitor dwarf itself may have been the product of\nmerging, it would retain traces of these past merging events. Mieske,\nHilker & Infante (2004) find that their results are consistent with both\nstripping and the merged stellar superclusters scenarios for UCOs.\nDoes any of this help in understanding our new objects? The two\nmechanisms discussed above by which extended clusters may be\nproduced from other objects (by nurture, as it were), involve either\nmerging of massive star clusters or stripping of dSphs. Fellhauer &\nKroupa (2002), using N-body simulations, find that they can form\nFF-like objects from the merger of the \u2018super star clusters\u2019 noted\nabove, such as might have their origins in galaxy\u2013galaxy interaction.\nFormation in such a single interaction event might explain why a\npopulation of extended clusters is found in M31 but not in the MW.\nIn the Fellhauer and Kroupa picture the FF clusters are subsequently\ntidally truncated to obtain the observed cluster sizes, which may not\nbe relevant given the large galactocentric radii of the M31 clusters.\nOn the other hand, van den Bergh & Mackey (2004) have noted that\nonly two Galactic GCs lie above the equation log Rh = 0.2MV +\n2.6 on the plot in Fig. 7, \u03c9 Cen and NGC 2419. They prefer the\nstripped dwarf model for these two objects and suggest that clusters\nabove the line can be best explained by such stripping, such as that\nmodelled in Bassino et al. (1994).\nThe question naturally arises as to what distance from M31 could\nclusters such as ours survive against tidal disruption, which obvi-\nously relates to the issue of how long-lived such clusters can be.

P. Huxor et al.\nvalues in Table 1 give masses for the clusters of \u22481.5 \u00d7 105 M\u0006.\nEmploying a logarithmic halo model and assuming a circular veloc-\nity of 250 km s\u22121, we find a galactocentric distance of \u224825 kpc is\nrequired to produce the tidal radii observed. This is consistent with\nthe radii at which we observe our clusters, and also the fact that none\nhave been found at smaller distances.\nThe above assumes a M\/L typical for GCs, but it is also possible,\nparticularly if the new clusters are stripped dwarfs, that they could\nhave some dark matter component. In this regard it is interesting that\nWillman et al. (2004) suggest that their object may be an extreme\ndwarf galaxy owing to its position on the MV\/Rh plot (their fig. 10),\nan argument which might also be applied to our new clusters.\nThe fact that the similarly extended but much fainter Willman\nobject has been discovered in the MW, but no objects similar to our\nM31 clusters strongly indicates that no such population exists in\nour Galaxy. This suggests that there might be important differences\nbetween the formation and evolution of M31, in comparison with\nthe MW, to allow for this new cluster population to form and survive.\nThis could be established by searching for similar clusters in more\ndistant galaxies covering a range in Hubble type and environment,\nbut here it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish such clusters\nfrom background galaxies.\n4 C O N C L U S I O N\nWe have presented three newly discovered globular-like (in terms\nof luminosity and colour) clusters in the halo of M31 with unusu-\nally large half-light radii, of around 30 pc (compared to typical GC\nvalues between 1 and 7 pc). These objects start to fill the gap in pa-\nrameter space between (negligible dark matter) classical GCs and\n(dark matter dominated) dwarf spheroidals. This is a region which\nin recent times has also been encroached by a variety of new ob-\njects, such as the UCOs in Fornax and massive GCs in NGC 5128.\nOur clusters are lower luminosity systems than these, and are rather\nbrighter and more extended than the so-called FF clusters, found by\n(Brodie & Larsen 2002) in two lenticular galaxies, and also bluer\nindicating a lower metallicity.\nThe extended M31 clusters have no known analogues in the MW,\nwhere such clusters would certainly have been discovered if they\nexisted, unless hidden by the plane of the Galaxy. This suggests that\nthey could hold important clues to the differing formation histories\nof these galaxies. If these clusters were not born with their present\nmorphology then one may speculate that they are the stripped cores\nof cannibalized dwarf spheroidal galaxies, or the products of cluster\nmergers perhaps themselves created in a previous interaction of a\ngas-rich companion with M31.\nUnlike the UCOs and FFs, these objects are comparatively nearby\nin M31, and hence (like G1) open to detailed, resolved, investiga-\ntion by both HST and ground-based instruments. Further, ongoing,\nobservations will reveal more about the nature of these intriguing\nobjects: metallicity; HB morphology; systemic and internal kine-\nmatics.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nAH is funded by a Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Coun-\ncil studentship.
