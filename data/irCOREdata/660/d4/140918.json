Introduction \nThe A wide variety of approaches have been developed for predicting fatigue crack growth life for cold-\nworked fastener holes [1-16]. The determination of the residual stress distribution around a cold-worked \nhole is an indispensable prerequisite for the life prediction process, because the residual tangential stress \ndistribution introduced by coldworking is the main reason for fatigue life extension of the part \nconsidered. Various techniques have been developed and used to determine the residual stress \ndistribution; these could be divided into three groups: experimental, numerical and analytical approaches. \nThe experimental techniques include the X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, Sach\u2019s cutting method, \nphoto-elastic and optical strain measurement. In general accurate results can be achieved by using the \nexperimental techniques as demonstrated by many successful examples [2-3, 7, 10, 17-24]. \nThe numerical approach typically employs the finite element methods (FEM), which have been shown to \nbe efficient for determining the residual stress distributions especially for the mid-thickness range, i.e. \nneither plane-stress nor plane-strain conditions [2, 7-8, 11, 21, 25-27]. FEM can also deal with material\u2019s \nnon-linearity behaviour incurred by cold expansion process.   \n                                                          \n* Corresponding author.

Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n2 \n \nClosed-form solutions are usually obtained by analytical techniques. Compared with the numerical or \nexperimental techniques, the closed-form theory often provides a simpler and faster method to acquire the \nresidual stress distribution, because neither special equipment nor tedious calculation is needed in the \nanalytical techniques. And more importantly, relatively good results can be obtained, if a solution is \nobtained based on adequate assumptions and theory. With the development of the cold-expansion \ntechnology, a number of such models have been developed such as those developed by Hsu-Forman [28], \nRich-Impellizzeri [1], Chang [3], Ball [6-7] and many others [9, 29-31]. The accuracy of these published \nclose-form models have been verified directly by either experimental measurements or numerical \ncalculations or indirectly by fatigue life results. Comparing to the efforts in FEM or experimental \nmeasurement, these close-form models are simpler to use in assessing the beneficial effect of cold \nexpansion. They can be very useful when combined with a computer program for fatigue crack growth \nlife prediction, which is especially helpful at the component design stage. \nWhile good agreement between fatigue test result and predicted lives was found by some researchers \nusing the closed-form models  [1, 3-4, 6-7, 9-10], disagreements were also experienced by many others \n[17-21, 23-24]. The present study aims at examining four popular analytical residual stress models and \nchecking the predicted lives against experimental data. The main objectives are: \n(a) To determine the residual tangential stress distribution for a coldworked hole by selected models; \n(b) To predict crack growth life by using the AFGROW computer program with input of residual stress \ndistributions determined by the closed-form models; \n(c) To evaluate the accuracy of each closed-form model by comparing the predicted crack growth life \nwith experimental results.  \n \n2. Review of four closed-form residual stress models  \nFour closed-form solutions are selected for this study, i.e. two plane-stress models by Hsu-Forman [28] \nand Ball [6], and two plane-strain models by Rich-Impellizzeri [1] and Chang [3]. These models are \nbriefly reviewed below and summarized in Table 1.  \nTable 1.

The notion that the yield limit of metals in reversed loading can be different from that \nin monotonic loading was first proposed by Bauschinger in 1886. For most engineering alloys, the reverse \nyield stress (\u03c3ry) is a fraction of the tensile yield stress (\u03c3y); this is the so-called Bauschinger or kinematic \nhardening effect. Assuming a linear hardening, this effect may be demonstrated for a one-dimensional \nproblem [32]. The yielding in tension will lower the reverse yield strength so that:  \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1285-1291.

As a result of this shift, with the initial \nyield limit \u03c3y being fixed, the reverse yield stress decreases and the uniaxial stress \u03c3  \u201chardens\u201d. In many \nstudies, the shift of the yield surface centre is defined by: \n  d\u03b1 = \u03b2 d\u03b5p )10( \u2264\u2264 \u03b2    (2) \nwhere \u03b2 is a Bauschinger effect related parameter; it depends on the material type, stress state and the \nmagnitude of applied plastic strain. \u03b2=0 simulates isotropic hardening; \u03b2=1 mimics kinematic hardening. \nFor most engineering alloys mixed hardening describes cyclic loading condition better, therefore 0< \u03b2 < 1 \nfor cyclic plasticity analysis.    \n2.1 Models based on plane-stress theory  \nThe Hsu-Forman model [28] was developed by extending the Nadai theory [29] taking account of work \nhardening effect. The main assumptions were: a) material behavior followed the Ramberg-Osgood \nrelationship; b) yielding was governed by the Mises-Hencky criterion; c) elastic unloading for mandrel \nremoval, hence no reverse yielding.  \nThe Ball\u2019s model [6-7] is an extension of the Hsu-Forman theory by including elastic-plastic unloading \nand, therefore, creating a reverse yielded zone. In the Hsu-Forman model, Budiansky\u2019s solution [33] was \nonly used for the loading step, but in Ball\u2019s model it was applied for both loading and unloading steps of \nthe coldworking process to generalize the solution and to include any potential reverse yielding. \nParameter \u03b2 was introduced to account for the Bauschinger effect. Ball and Lowry evaluated their theory \nagainst some x-ray diffraction measurements for a 6.35mm thick 2124-T851 aluminium specimen [7], \nwhich showed good agreement. They verified the model further by comparing the predicted fatigue life \nwith the fatigue test results; good agreement was achieved. \n2.2 Models based on plane-strain theory \nThe Rich-Impellizzeri model [1] is a modification of the elasto-plastic solution of Sachs [34] by including \nthe elastic deformation of the mandrel. The model also assumed elastic unloading following the mandrel \nremoval. The authors validated their theory against some test results for two alloys.  \nChang\u2019s model was developed based on the elasto-plastic solution of a pressurized thick-walled cylinder \nof Sachs [34]. It assumed perfectly plastic material, plane-strain condition under uniform pressure at the \nhole edge, and Misses-Hencky yield criterion. Residual stress distribution was computed for a 12.7mm \nthick 2024-T851 aluminium plate with a coldworked hole and then used for predicting fatigue crack \ngrowth in the plate. Good correlation with test data was obtained. \n2.3. Residual stress calculation \nResidual stress distributions described by the four models were calculated for a simple dog-bone \nspecimen with a coldworked hole in the centre as shown in Fig 1. The specimen was made of 2024-\nT351 aluminium alloy having the width of 25 mm, thickness of 6 mm and hole diameter of 6.35 mm. In \nthis study, the original Rich-Impellizzeri and Ball\u2019s models were modified to account for the \nBauschinger effect for this aluminium alloy. For the modified Rich-Impellizzeri model a reverse yield \nstress being 60% of that in tension was assumed. For Ball\u2019s model kinematic hardening (\u03b2=1) was \nassumed. For this alloy the work hardening index in the original Budiansky\u2019s relation [33], n, was \nassumed to be equal to 2.7 for the Hsu-Forman and Ball models. The differences in the theoretical \npredictions simply reflect the theoretical treatment of residual stresses adopted by different researchers.  \nFigure 1 also shows that the residual tangential stress distributions can be divided into three regions (A, \nB and C). Region A is at the vicinity of hole edge having compressive tangential stress and a reverse \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1285-1291. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n4 \n \nyield zone, region B is transitional between compression and tension with elasto-plastic stresses, and \nregion C is the elastic region. \n \n \nFig. 1 Residual stress distributions calculated by four different closed-form models. \n \n3. Prediction of crack growth lives and discussion \n3.1 Life prediction results and validation tests \nThree different specimen geometries were chosen for this study, i.e. specimens A, B and C. The \ngeometrical and testing details are listed in Table 2. As all three specimens are around 6 mm thick, which \nfits in neither plane-strain nor plane-stress conditions, they lie in the so-called \u201ctransition region\u201d. Crack \ngrowth lives of the three specimens were predicted by using the above four closed-form residual stress \nmodels and the AFGROW computer program [35]. The predicted results, together with the test results, are \ngiven in Figs. 2-4, respectively. For specimen A the average fatigue lives to initiate a 0.5 mm long crack \nwere 5000 flights for plain hole specimens and 7500 flights for coldworked specimens, respectively [36]. \nTherefore, the initial crack length was set 0.5 mm for the crack growth life prediction for specimen A \n(Fig. 2). Four specimens\u2019 test results were reported in Fig. 2: T07 and T09 for plain hole tests, and T05 \nand T06 for coldworked holes. Crack length were constantly measured and for most tests, 0.5 mm long \ncracks were found with high confidence [36], but cracks shorter than this length (T06R) were also found \nand reported in Fig. 2.          \nAccording to Poolsuk & Sharpe [18], when the plate thickness and the hole diameter are about the same, \nthe plane-strain theory gives better prediction. Of the four residual stress models used in this study, Rich-\nImpellizzeri and Chang\u2019s models are based on the plane-strain theory, so it was expected that they provide \nrealistic residual stresses that should lead to good fatigue life prediction. This is demonstrated in the tests \nA and B (Figs. 2-3): the modified Rich-Impellizzeri model predicts the lower boundary while the Chang\u2019s \nmodel estimated high boundary of fatigue lives (Fig. 2); both predictions fall into the acceptable range. \nHsu-Forman and Ball\u2019s models are based on the plane-stress theory, and they both overestimated the \nfatigue crack growth life for specimen A. Hsu-Forman model overestimated the fatigue life significantly; \nbetween 2-4 times longer lives were predicted, so that the prediction curve is out of the scale of Fig. 2. \n-2.0\n-1.5\n-1.0\n-0.5\n-\n0.5\n1.0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nDistance from hole edge (mm)\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\n re\nsi\ndu\nal\n st\nre\nss\n \nThe border of plastic and elastic region\nOriginal Rich-Impellizzeri\nModified Rich-Impellizzeri\nHsu-Forman \n(n=2.7)\nChang\nBall\nn=2.7 \u03b2=1\n   \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1285-1291.

Apart from the Bauschinger effect, material\u2019s hardening index, \nresidual stress profiles and initial crack length all play important roles. A parametric study on these \nfactors is presented in Section 3.2. For all three tests Ball\u2019s model could give good predictions when set \n\u03b2=1 (Fig. 2-4). However, for 2024-T351 alloy, both theoretical and experimental works suggest that the \ncyclic stress-strain behaviour is better represented by a mixed hardening rule. However, when using a \nmixed hardening rule (0<\u03b2<1) the life was overestimated by the Ball\u2019s model suggesting there are other \ninfluential factors. Details are discussed in the next section. \nTable 2.

Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n7 \n \n3.2 Discussion on influential factors  \n3.2.1 The strain hardening index n  \nIn Hsu-Forman and Ball\u2019s models, the stress-strain relationship is expressed by the Budiansky\u2019s \nrelation [33]: \n  \nE\n\u03c3\u03b5 =    (\u03c3 < \u03c3y);  1)( \u2212= n\nyE \u03c3\n\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5   (\u03c3 > \u03c3y)    (3) \nwhere n is the parameter related to strain hardening and thus defining the shape of the uniaxial \nmonotonic stress-train curve after yielding. However, most engineering stress-strain curves are usually \nexpressed by the Ramberg-Osgood relation, which can be found in many textbooks on metal fatigue, \nsuch as [37-38]. In an analogous fashion, the cyclic stable stress-stain response is characterized by the \nsame relationship [37]: \n   saaa AE\n\/1)(\n\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5 +=          (4) \nwhere, \u03b5a =\u2206\u03b5\/2 is the strain amplitude, \u03c3a =\u2206\u03c3\/2 the stress amplitude, E elastic modulus, A and s are \nconstants for a given material, and s is the cyclic strain hardening exponent. The values of A and s have \nbeen given in [37] for some materials, but data are not available for the 2024-T351. We therefore used \nfollowing formula for 2024-T351 because the constants are available [38]:     \n   \u03b5=\nE\n\u03c3\n+0.002( 5.9)\n420\n\u03c3\n          (5) \nFitting the curve by Eq. 5 to the curves calculated by Eq. 3, the value of n was 2.7 for 2024-T351 \n(specimen A). For the materials used for specimens B and C, the index are close to n=2 and n=3, \nrespectively.  \n3.2.2 The Bauschinger effect  \nAs mentioned before, the Bauschinger parameter \u03b2 was introduced in the unloading formula of the \nBall\u2019s model, which significantly influences the shape and the magnitude of the residual compressive \nstresses near the hole edge (region A in Fig. 1), hence affects the crack growth life. For specimen A \nmade of 2024-T351 alloy, variations of the residual stress distribution and the corresponding fatigue \nlife ratio Fl (predicted life \/ test life) with different \u03b2 values are given in Fig 5, which shows that \u03b2 \nvalue directly influences the point where the reverse yielding begins during the unloading step. For \u03b2 \n=0 (isotropic hardening), the reverse yield zone is smaller, but the magnitude of the compressive \nstresses in region A is larger. Since the reverse yield zone is smaller than the initial crack length (0.5 \nmm), the predicted life and Fl are longer compared to the predictions based on \u03b2 > 0.4.  The predicted \nlife is the lowest and most close to test result (Fl = 1.52) when \u03b2 = 1 (kinematic hardening). Therefore \nassuming kinematic hardening in Ball\u2019s original model works very well for this material and test. The \ndifference of Fl values between \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b2 =1 is more than 10 times.  \nThe Rich-Impellizzeri model was also modified to account for the Bauschinger effect. In this study, the \nresidual compressive stresses near the hole edge were assumed to be constant at a fraction of the tensile \nyield stress, i.e. \u03c3ry = c\u03c3y, c\u22641. The original Rich-Impellizzeri model predicts variable residual \ncompressive stresses near the hole edge and the magnitude of the maximum compressive stress is larger \nthan the tensile yield stress, e.g. c=1.1 \u2013 1.2 for test case A.  Fig. 6 shows the predicted residual \ntangential stress distributions with different c values and predicted fatigue lives. As c approaches 1 the \nhardening rule becomes increasingly isotropic, consequently the reverse yield zone is smaller and the \nmagnitude of compressive residual stress increases. Fig. 6 also shows that the mixed hardening \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1285-1291. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n8 \n \nbehavior (\u03c3ry = 0.6\u20130.7\u03c3y) gives the best prediction of fatigue crack growth life.

Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n9 \n \n3.2.3 Effect of residual stress profile and initial crack length \nAlthough the two residual stress distributions determined by the Ball and the Chang\u2019s models are \ndifferent (Fig. 1), the life prediction results are similar and both models predicted the final lives very well \n(Fig. 2). However, one can see the difference between these two models from the corresponding crack \ngrowth life curves, which show that the curves predicted by the Chang\u2019s model can only fit the test results \nin the final stage, while the predictions by Ball\u2019s model match almost entire crack growth history. The \nreason for using different residual stress distributions resulting in similar Fl values is that the Fl is \ncalculated by summing of the life accumulations from different stages. Compared with the Ball model, \nthe Chang\u2019s model gives more life contribution in region A but less contribution in region B, but the total \nlife sum might be the same. Therefore, the residual stress distribution determined by the Ball\u2019s model \n(\u03b2=1) is the closest one to the actual residual stress situations for the three specimens studied. This \nstatement is supported by the experiment results in [6-7, 10, 21]. The results in [21], which were obtained \nby the x-ray diffraction, are more persuadable, because the specimens in [21] were made of same \nmaterial, having similar thickness, hole diameter and cold-expansion ratio as the specimen A of this \nstudy. \nWhen a crack grows into the residual stress region C (Fig. 1), the crack has entered the so called \u201cfast \ncrack growth\u201d region. Therefore, the accuracy in residual stress values and distribution in regions A and \nB are more important for life prediction than region C. The life proportion from growth in region A is \nalso dependent upon the initial crack length. The longer the initial crack length, the less the contribution \nwill be made by that region. For example, as shown in Fig.1, compared with the other models, the Hsu-\nForman model overestimated the compressive stresses in the A region and underestimated the stresses in \nB. If an initial crack length (ai) is longer compared to the length of region A, the life predicted by Hsu-\nForman model will be shorter (than test results). In the present investigation, fatigue lives were \nunderestimated based on the Hsu-Forman model for specimens B and C, because long initial crack \nlengths were chosen (1.5 and 1.9 mm, respectively). Similarly, life was overestimated for specimen A by \nthe Hsu-Forman model because a much shorter initial crack length of 0.5 mm was chosen. However when \nthe initial crack length of specimen A was assumed to be 1 mm, the predicted life was greatly reduced \ncompared to the corresponding test result from 1 mm crack to final failure.  \nIt should be noted that all these residual stress models are developed for cold expanded or interference \nfitted holes assuming there are no cracks. However, the life predictions made in this study (and many \nothers in the literature) assumed the residual stress distribution remained the same after initiation of a \nsmall crack. This assumption is not correct. Ozdemir & Edwards [40] found that the residual tangential \nstress profile near the hole would decay due to the initiation and growth of short fatigue cracks; both \nfatigue loading cycles and initiation of a small crack will affect the residual stress profile. Therefore, \ncurrent life prediction exercises based on close-form models will only provide approximate fatigue \nlifetimes.    \n5. Conclusions \nGood prediction of fatigue crack growth life can be achieved if a suitable closed-form model is used for \ndetermining the residual tangential stress distribution. For specimens with thickness of around 6 mm, \nsome modifications are necessary to the four closed-form residual stress models reviewed, which deal \nwith either plane-stress or plane-strain conditions. Among the four closed-form models studied in this \npaper, attention should be paid to the parameters associated with work hardening and the Bauschinger \neffect.  \nLife prediction for cold worked holes is also very sensitive to the initial crack length. This is because \nthat the beneficial residual stresses only exist in the early stage of crack growth.   \nInternational Journal of Fatigue, 25 (2003), 1285-1291. Available online at www.sciencedirect.com  \n \n10 \n \nThe Hsu-Forman model is not suitable for specimens with thickness around 6 mm, because it gives \nunrealistic residual compressive stresses under plane stress condition.  \nBall\u2019s model works very well for the material and tests reviewed in this work if assuming kinematic \nhardening behaviour. \nThe Rich-Impellizzeri model over-estimates the residual compressive stresses near the hole edge, but \ngives good description for the stresses away from hole edge. Therefore, with suitable modification by \nincorporating the Bauschinger effect, the accuracy in life prediction can be improved. \n6.
