The layering formation is examined for carbon nanotubes spanning from\n(8, 8) to (20, 20) subjected to pressures and temperatures that range from 1 \u2212 20 bar and 300 \u2212 400 K,\nrespectively. Well defined layers are developed around the internal and external surface of the nanotubes\nfor all the examined cases. It is shown that the number of layers along with their relative strength varies as\na function of the nanotube\u2019s diameter, size, carbon dioxide density and gas-structure interactions.\nKeywords: adsorption, carbon nanotubes, carbon dioxide, density layers, molecular dynamics\n1. Introduction\nCarbon dioxide is the most prominent greenhouse gas with more than 30 billion tons being released\nevery year in the earth\u2019s atmosphere (1). More than 30% of the released CO2 is produced from fossil\nfuel power plants (1, 2) and an almost equal portion from the continuously increasing number of vehicles.\nThe increasingly high volumes of carbon dioxide emitted in the atmosphere have stimulated the interest\nof the scientific community towards the development of new strategies and techniques for carbon capture\nand sequestration. Technological advancements, arising from these innovative strategies, contribute to the\nimplementation of CO2 mitigation schemes with the expectation of a wide range of socio-economic benefits.\nCarbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered among the most promising nano-materials (3) encompassing\na large application envelope that spans from nano-electronics and materials science (4, 5) to biology (6, 7).\nOver the last years, significant efforts have been devoted to exploring the capabilities of CNT technology in\ngas separation and filtration (8\u201311). Experimental studies and computational modelling have shown that\ngases can be transported inside single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) orders of magnitude faster com-\npared to zeolites or other traditional microporous materials (12). Their very small pore size along with their\nalmost frictionless graphitic walls offer a rare combination of high selectivity and transport efficiency (13)\nand make them ideal gas adsorbents (14). Although considerable efforts have been dedicated to investigating\neither CNT-based materials for hydrogen storage (15\u201318) or CNT behaviour in water environment (19\u201322),\nstudies regarding interactions of CNT with CO2 are scarce (12, 23, 24).\nAlthough comparative studies of gas transport properties through CNTs are limited, it has been shown\nthat carbon dioxide\u2019s adsorption rates are almost one order of magnitude higher compared to methane (25).\nCNTs show simultaneously hydrophobic and CO2-phylic attributes causing carbon dioxide molecules to\nform layers in the vicinity of the graphitic walls whereas water molecules concentrate towards the centric\naxis of the tube. Carbon dioxide can bind in fewer adsorption sites compared to other gases such as H2, O2\nand Ar indicating therefore a different adsorption mechanism (26).\nThe rapid transport of molecules through CNTs is primarily originated from the absence of any corru-\ngation in the molecule-CNT potential energy surface (12). As a consequence, the slip length (27) observed\ninside the nanotubes are three to four orders of magnitude higher compared to their radius (28), indicating\na nearly frictionless CNT interface. In the case of more hydrophobic solvents, the slip length values decrease\ndue to the stronger interactions between the CNT walls and the gas molecules (29). Despite the experimental\nand computational efforts that have been dedicated over the last years, the transport of light gases through\nPreprint submitted to Chemical Physics Letters February 23, 2011\n  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \ncarbon nanotubes along with the effects of the nanotube\u2019s characteristics are not entirely understood and\ncannot be described properly by Knudsen diffusion (30). In the present study molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations, using the LAMMPS (31) simulation software, are employed to explore the intrinsic behaviour\nof carbon dioxide transport through one SWCNT, aiming to enhance our physical understanding regarding\nthe layering phenomena observed close to the nanotube\u2019s graphitic walls.\n2. Simulation Method\nThe computational domain consists of a cubic box with edges equal to 290 A\u02da and periodic boundary\nconditions applied in all three directions. For the scope of the current study, different nanotubes are employed\nspanning from (8, 8) to (20, 20) under pressure and temperature conditions that range from 1\u2212 20 bar and\n300\u2212 400 K respectively. For these conditions carbon dioxide remains gaseous avoiding any supercritical or\nliquid states (32). The volume outside the nanotube is filled with carbon dioxide molecules spanning from\n442 to 13152, subject to the specific figures of pressure and temperature (33). The original CO2 velocities\nare initialised based on a Gaussian distribution according to the temperature value of the corresponding\ncase. The CO2 molecules are represented by utilising a spherical model (34, 35) with the parameters for the\nvan der Waals interactions being \u03b5CO2\/kB = 235.9 K and \u03c3CO2 = 3.454 A\u02da and mass equal to 44.010 g\/mol.\nPrevious computational studies (19, 23) show that the use of a spherical model for simulating the CO2\nand its interactions with the SWCNTs provides reasonable approximation compared to linear models for\npressures up to 100 bar.\nAlthough the structural properties of the nanotubes, like flexibility, may affect the transport behaviour\nof the molecules inside and around the nanotubes, in the current study the CNTs are assumed to be rigid\nwith parameters \u03b5C\u2217\/kB = 28.0068 K and \u03c3C\u2217 = 3.4 A\u02da (19), where C\n\u2217 corresponds to CNTs\u2019 carbon atom.\nThis assumption is consistent with previous theoretical and numerical studies (36). The NVT ensemble\n(isochoric-isothermic) (37) is employed in the simulations with time step \u03b4t = 1fs; 2 \u00b7 104 time steps\nhave been performed for equilibration corresponding to 20 ps and another 2 \u00b7 107 time steps for averaging\ncorresponding to 20 ns.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Layering Phenomena\nFig. 1 shows the formation of carbon dioxide layers inside and around the nanotubes at temperature\n300 K and pressure 20 bar. The internal volume of the nanotube is divided to axial bins with characteristic\nstructures being formed in the vicinity of the carbon surface, thus resulting in strong density layering\nindependently of the nanotube\u2019s size. The number of the inner layers formed (Fig. 2(a)) varies and is\nnot always an increasing function of the tube\u2019s diameter, as it has been reported in previous studies of\noxygen transport in CNTs (38). The formation of the layers is generated due to the combined effect of\nthe nanotube\u2019s radius, the gas-structure interactions and the van der Waals bond length between the gas\nmolecules. A characteristic prime internal layer is developed, for all the examined cases (as seen in Fig. 2),\nat a certain distance from the tube\u2019s wall which is comparable to the zero-crossing distance \u03c3CO2\u2212C\u2217 . The\ndevelopment of the internal prime layer reduces the volume that is available to the carbon dioxide molecules\nto travel within the nanotube. The effects of the available volume reduction are stronger in cases where the\nradius of the nanotube is comparable to the characteristic distance of the prime layer from the tube\u2019s wall,\ncausing in some cases the formation of either triple or (fairly strong) secondary layers.\nIn the (8, 8) nanotube, only the prime internal layer is observed. Due to its small internal volume and\nits large surface-to-volume ratio, the fluid-structure interactions dominate, thus causing the carbon dioxide\nparticles to remain in a layer structure around the graphitic walls. As the radius increases further, multi-\nlayer formations, either double or triple, are observed. The additional layers are developed at a distance from\nthe prime one, comparable to the relaxation distance \u03c3CO2\u2212CO2 . The secondary layer appears initially in\nthe (10, 10) nanotube and remains for the rest of the examined cases, where larger diameters are employed.\nApart from the (10, 10) nanotube, the secondary density layer is less strong compared to the prime one since\n2\n  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nthe interactions from the graphitic walls diminish for the gas molecules that lie further inside the tube. For\nthe (10, 10) nanotube the secondary layer is formed exactly at the centre of tube. The repulsive forces from\nthe tube\u2019s walls and the CO2 molecules of the prime layer combined with the small volumes of the axial\nslabs involved, cause the remaining carbon dioxide molecules to stay at the centre of the nanotube axis at\nhigh densities (Fig. 2(a)). The latter leads to capillary condensation issues, which require further attention\nand will be examined in future studies.\nThe development of triple layering is observed only in the (16, 16) nanotube. The third layer lies at the\nnanotube\u2019s axis and is formed due to the combined effect of the tube\u2019s size and gas interaction parameters.\nEquivalent to the formation of the secondary layer to the (10, 10) nanotube, the CO2 molecules that remain\nin the two outer layers along with the graphitic walls push the rest of the carbon dioxide particles towards\nthe centric axis of the cylinder. Due to the lack of available motion space the remaining CO2 molecules\ngenerate this third layering structure. Generally, it can be noticed that as the interior volume increases, the\nsurface-to-volume ratio decreases thereby resulting in lower density values both at the prime and secondary\ndensity peaks. However, in all the examined scenarios the carbon dioxide density inside the SWCNT remains\nat around an order of magnitude higher compared to the bulk one.\nFig. 2(b) shows the characteristic structures developed at the external space of the nanotubes. These\nlayering structures are primarily affected by the size of the contact surface between the SWCNT and the\ncarbon dioxide molecules. For all the examined cases, two layers are identified; a major one in the proximity\nof SWCNT at a certain distance from the tube\u2019s walls and a secondary one similarly placed at a specific\ndistance from the main layer. As the diameter of the nanotubes increases, their external surface increases\nlinearly thus attracting a larger number of CO2 molecules, which is translated to an increase of the main\nlayer\u2019s density values (Fig. 2(b)). The external surfaces of the nanotubes are exposed to the CO2 in a more\ndirect way than the internal ones, where the adsorption process is initiated at the ends of the tube, followed\nby diffusion to the nanotube\u2019s interior. As a result, adsorption on external surfaces reaches equilibrium\nmuch faster than on the interior, under the same pressure and temperature conditions (39).\nFig. 3(a) shows the radial density profiles as function of pressure at 300 K in the internal space of a\n(20, 20) nanotube. The pressure does not impact the layers\u2019 topology, which remains intact as previously\ndescribed, however, it affects the peak values of the prime density layers along with the development of the\nsecondary ones. Specifically, as the pressure increases, the formation of secondary layers is fostered and\nthe prime density maxima, as absolute values, are enhanced (see Fig. 3(a)). Although the prime density\nlayers become stronger when pressure increases, their strength relative to the bulk density of the fluid is\na decreased function of pressure, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Higher pressure values imply higher densities,\nhowever, the density layering is not increasing proportionally to the increment of the medium\u2019s bulk density,\nthus resulting in a declining trend of the normalised maxima. Despite the considerable difference between\nthe prime peak values for P = 1 bar and P = 5 bar (Fig. 3(a)), the normalised density profiles (Fig. 3(b))\nshow that density strength remains almost the same and about three orders of magnitude higher than the\nbulk figure. As the pressure further increases, the non-normalised profiles show that the density tends non-\nlinearly to a maximum value corresponding to the maximum number of carbon dioxide molecules that can\nbe accommodated around the graphitic walls of the nanotube. Hence, the relative adsorption performance\nis a diminishing function of pressure and, if the pressure values continue to grow, the saturation effects will\nbe dominant and this decreasing behaviour will be more evident. Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b) show the external\nnormalised and non-normalised density profiles for the (20, 20) nanotube at T = 300 K. Comparing the\nexternal and the internal normalised densities, is apparent that low pressures affects the adsorption by the\nexternal surface of the nanotube to a higher degree than the internal one.\n3.2. Adsorption Isotherms\nFig. 4(a) presents the adsorption isotherms of CO2 in four arm chair (n, n) nanotubes at 300 K. The\ntotal adsorption for each case has been normalised over the maximum adsorption of the (8, 8) nanotube\n(P = 20 bar, T = 300 K), aiming to provide a more quantitative understanding of its dependency from the\nnanotube\u2019s size. The total adsorption calculations are based on the number of molecules that have been\nadsorbed both on the internal and external surface of the nanotubes. For the external molecules, we consider\n3\n  \n 1 \n 2 \n 3 \n 4 \n 5 \n 6 \n 7 \n 8 \n 9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n33 \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \nthat the adsorbed ones are those that belong to the first density layer formed in the vicinity of the SWCNT,\nand more specifically at a distance less than 5 A\u02da from the tube walls (see Fig. 2(b)).\nAt low pressures, adsorption does not have a clear dependence on the tube size as can be observed\nby the small total adsorption deviations among the examined nanotubes (see Fig. 4(a)). Lower values of\npressure are related to lower densities and, consequently, to smaller number of CO2 molecules that travel\nthrough the nanotube leading to restricted capacity rates. However, as the pressure increases above 10 bar\nthe density values become sufficient to reveal the importance of the nanotube\u2019s surface and volume. At\nhigher pressures, larger nanotubes present greater CO2 capture rates since the uptake is not restricted by\nthe number of CO2 molecules but from available SWCNT\u2019s volumes. At 20 bar, it is clear that nanotubes\nwith larger diameters show greater capacity due to (i) their larger interior volume that can accommodate a\nlarger number of CO2 molecules; and (ii) their larger surface that generates stronger external density layers\nand, consequently, increases the carbon dioxide molecules adsorbed on the external surface. Another element\nthat is observed is that each adsorption isotherm consists of two phases, a linear and an asymptotic one,\nwith the latter corresponding to the beginning of the saturation process. The asymptotic phase is related\nto saturation effects that take place as the density of the medium increases due to the increased pressure.\nAs the nanotube\u2019s radius increases, the transition to the asymptotic phase is delayed since nanotubes with\nlarger internal volume and external surface require larger amount of carbon dioxide molecules to become\nsaturated.\nFig. 4(b) shows the adsorption isobars for the examined nanotubes, showing the changes in their adsorp-\ntion capacity as a function of temperature at constant pressure of 20 bar. At 300 K the (20, 20) nanotube\npresents more than 25% higher adsorption rates compared to the (8, 8) one. However, as the temperature in-\ncreases these differences become smaller, with the adsorption capacity of the (20, 20) and (8, 8) approaching\nthe capacity values of the other nanotubes. As temperature rises, the secondary layers, both internal and\nexternal, diffuse almost instantly followed by the prime internal layer and last by the prime external layer\nwhich is the one with the smaller diffusion rates. The density reduction in the internal and external layers\nis reflected to a subsequent reduction of total adsorption as higher values of temperature are employed (Fig.\n4(b)). It appears that as the kinetic energy increases, due to the increased temperature, the CO2 molecules\nshow higher diffusivities preventing them from staying adsorbed in the nanotube (30).\n4. Concluding Overview\nIn conclusion, the present study shows a well defined pattern of CO2 layer formation, which is dependent\non the tube\u2019s size, and gas-structure interactions. The formation of carbon dioxide layers in the vicinity\nof the tube\u2019s graphitic walls have been examined for pressure and temperature ranging from 1 \u2212 20 bar\nand 300 \u2212 400 K respectively. The numerical experiments showed that, apart from the primary layers\nformed around the CNTs, secondary and even tertiary density layers are observed in the internal volume\nof the tube. Specifically, if the tube\u2019s radius is almost double or triple the equilibrium distance between\nthe internal layers then their strength is enhanced, as shown for the (10, 10) and (16, 16) SWCNTs. The\nvariation of the density behaviour as a function of the nanotubes diameter leads to the conclusion that care\nmust be exercised in choosing nanotubes with the appropriate characteristics that correspond to optimum\noperating conditions for real-life applications.\nReferences\n[1] D.
