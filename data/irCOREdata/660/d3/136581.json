For example, if we imagine the act of clicking\nour fingers together, completing the motor action generates\ninstantaneous visual, tactile, and auditory sensory information.\nRecently, Stetson et al. [1] demonstrated that the perceived timing\nof the visuo-motor component of this action-event ensemble can\nbe markedly influenced by recent experience. Adaptation to a\nfixed delay between a button press and ensuing visual flash induces\nnon-veridical perception of subsequent, physically simultaneous\nbutton press-flash pairings: their reported temporal order is\nreversed\u2013\u2018I saw the flash before I pressed the button!\u2019 - providing\nempirical quantification of earlier, qualitative reports [2]. More\nrecent reports suggest that such effects can persist for at least 40\nseconds in the absence of updated visual feedback [3]. This type of\ntemporal recalibration is reminiscent of the nervous system\u2019s\nresponse to spatial misalignment between seen and felt location\nduring prism adaptation experiments (e.g. [4]). It also has parallels\nwith purely sensory effects observed following adaptation to\naudiovisual asynchrony [5\u20137]. Recently, Hanson et al. [8]\nspeculated that a single \u2018supramodal\u2019 mechanism may be\nresponsible for the recalibration of perceived time across sensory\npairings. Other behavioural studies provide support for this\nconcept. For example, despite absolute differences between\nobservers, within-observer differences in temporal sensitivity are\nwell correlated between perceptual and motor timing tasks [9\u201311].\nMoreover, perceptual learning effects observed during interval\ntiming tasks are highly specific to the trained base interval yet\nreadily transfer between visual hemispheres [12], sensory modal-\nities [13], and perceptual to motor tasks [14,15]. These findings\nimply that time itself\u2013rather than the nature of the sensory or\nmotor information by which it is defined\u2013may be the critical\nperceptual parameter. Returning to the example of Stetson et al.\u2019s\n[1] visuo-motor effects, a single, late-stage timing mechanism\nmight be expected to recalibrate all the self generated sensory\nconsequences of motor actions in a similar manner [16].\nDespite this, a host of recent studies have demonstrated that\nvisual stimuli such as that employed by Stetson et al. are subject to\nperceptual distortions with seemingly low-level neural loci. For\nexample, simply reducing the visibility or increasing spatial\nfrequency of visual stimuli induces dramatic compressions in their\nperceived duration [17]. Similar effects have been observed\nfollowing adaptation to drifting gratings [18,19], flickering patches\n[19] or simply executing a saccadic eye movement [20].\nSignificantly, these adaptation effects have been shown to be\nspecific to the visual modality [19] and the region of visual space\noccupied by the adapting stimulus [18,19]. In the auditory\ndomain, psychophysical interval timing data is successfully\npredicted by a model whose temporal estimates are derived from\nthe spatiotemporal distribution of neural activity (or \u2018state\ndependent networks\u2019) which could be performed at a range of\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7681\nneural processing scales [21]. This model is supported by a\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study showing that TMS\nto visual cortical areas degrades visual (but not auditory) temporal\nsensitivity [22]. Taken together, these findings are difficult to\nreconcile with centralised clock models and point toward early,\nperipheral timing mechanisms that are selective for modality and\nlow-level stimulus features.\nGiven this dichotomy in the literature, it is conceivable that the\nnervous system could employ (i) a single, central, supramodal\nmechanism charged with encoding all visuo-motor, auditory-\nmotor and tactile-motor temporal information, or (ii) each\nsensorimotor domain could employ its own individual, peripheral\nmechanism. Here we examine this issue by investigating the\ninteraction between sensorimotor timing, causality and the role of\nrecent experience across the sensory modalities.\nResults\nObservers adapted to a fixed delay (either 50, 100, 200, 400 or\n800 ms) between the completion of their motor action (a\nmousepress) and either visual (an LED \u2018flash\u2019), auditory (a white\nnoise \u2018click\u2019) or tactile (a \u2018tap\u2019 delivered to the opposite index\nfinger) feedback. Observers were instructed to press the mouse\nbutton at intervals of their own choosing so as to ensure their\nmotor actions were entirely voluntary in nature [23,24]. Following\nadaptation, observers were presented with a range of \u2018test\u2019 stimuli\nin which their \u2018test\u2019 motor action (mousepress) was followed by\nsensory feedback (from within the same modality as the adapting\nstimuli) with a variable delay (25\u2013125 ms). Observers made binary\nforced choice temporal order judgments (TOJs) as to \u2018which came\nfirst, my mousepress or the flash\/click\/tap?\u2019 (see \u2018Materials and\nMethods\u2019 for details).\nFigure 1A provides an example of the resultant psychometric\nfunctions for the condition where observers adapted to delayed\naudio-motor feedback following their motor actions. The percent-\nage of \u2018event before action\u2019 responses is plotted against test delay.\nTaking the example of the \u2018200 ms\u2019 adaptation data (green curve -\ndiamonds), it can be seen that at small test delays (e.g. 25 ms)\nobservers perceive an illusory reversal of temporal order: despite\nphysical delays between their motor actions and subsequent\nsensory events, they report the action to follow the event. As test\ndelay increases, the perception of temporal order becomes more\nveridical, with the percentage of \u2018event before action\u2019 responses\nfalling toward zero. The fact that these functions are laterally\ndisplaced (relative to one another) shows that this effect is\ndependent on the magnitude of the adapting delay. Specifically,\nfunctions pertaining to the 50 ms condition (red curve - circles)\nthrough to the 200 ms condition show a progressive rightward\nshift in their mid-points. Larger adapting delays result in a\nprogressive reduction of illusory responses.\nThe midpoints of these functions represent the point of\nsubjective simultaneity (the physical temporal offset corresponding\nto perceptual sensorimotor simultaneity or \u2018PSS\u2019). Their depen-\ndence on adapting delay is illustrated in Figure 2 where the PSS\nvalues have been extracted, averaged across observers and plotted\nas a function of adapting delay. Inspection of Figure 2 shows that\nadaptation to small delays between motor actions and their\nassociated visual (red circles), auditory (blue squares) or tactile\nFigure 1.

(A) A sample of the psychometric functions generated via temporal order judgments: \u2018which came first, action or\nevent?\u2019. This sample shows unimodal data from the audio-motor section of the adaptation experiment. The percentage of \u2018event before action\u2019 trials\n(i.e. where observers report an illusory reversal of temporal order) is plotted as a function of test delay (the physical asynchrony between their action\n(a mousepress) and a sensory event (an auditory \u2018click\u2019 in this example)). The different coloured functions represent different sensorimotor adaptation\ndelays (see Figure key for details). (B) Data for the same observer for a control experiment. The only difference between the data shown in A&B is the\nnature of the judgment type. In this data set, observers were presented with the same stimuli (\u2018mousepress-click\u2019) but made synchronous\/\nasynchronous (as opposed to temporal order) judgements (see main text for details). The same Figure key applies to both panels.\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0007681.g001\nEffect before Cause\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7681\n(green diamonds) sensory feedback produces vigorous perceptual\nrecalibration of perceived sensorimotor time - observers require an\nincreasing physical delay between their mousepress and subsequent\nsensory feedback in order to perceive perceptual sensorimotor\nsimultaneity. The magnitude of this recalibration appears to form\na fixed proportion of the adapting delay when the delay is below\n,200 ms [5], beyond which a reduction in effect size is observed.\nThe significant effect of delay was confirmed by a repeated\nmeasures analysis of variance (F4,16 = 37.1, p,0.001). The\ndifference between PSS values for each of the three senses just\nreached significance (F2,8 = 5.57, p = 0.030) although there was no\nsignificant interaction between delay and effect size (F8,32 = 1.30,\np.0.05).\nSome consider that TOJs may be susceptible to response bias or\n\u2018criterion-based\u2019 artefacts that can shift PSS via strategic factors\nthat are likely to be of a cognitive, rather than perceptual nature\n[25,26]. It could be argued that observers\u2013subconsciously or\notherwise\u2013adopted a strategy of distributing their TOJ responses\naround some criterion other than their perceived arrival times.\nThis could have the effect of shifting the functions midpoint in the\nopposite direction to the response bias. It has been suggested that a\n\u2018synchronous\/asynchronous\u2019 judgment type is less susceptible to\nthis issue [26,27]. We therefore conducted a control experiment\nwhere the audio-motor paradigm was revisited. The stimuli and\nprocedures were identical to those used in the previous experiment\nwith the exception that observers were now asked to make forced\nchoice judgments about whether their actions and subsequent\nsensory feedback were synchronous or asynchronous. The data are\nshown in Figure 1B alongside the psychometric functions for the\nsame representative, na\u0131\u00a8ve observer. Fitting these data with\nGaussian functions (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 for details) allows\nvisualisation of how PSS (the function\u2019s mean or \u2018peak\u2019 value)\nvaries with adapting delay. If our effects were peculiar to TOJs we\nwould expect the Gaussians to be superimposed on top of one\nanother with means centered around zero. This is clearly not the\ncase. Comparison with Figure 1A reveals that, despite some small\ndifferences (e.g. in the 200 ms delay condition, the PSS shift is\nslightly larger for synchronous\/asynchronous judgements than for\nTOJs), the overall pattern of results is strikingly similar: a\nprogressive rightward shift in the mean\u2019s lateral position from\nthe 50\u2013200 ms conditions with larger delays reversing the trend.\nThis finding suggests that our effects are relatively robust and\ncannot be ascribed to idiosyncrasies in observer judgment type.\nIt should be stressed that our illusory effects in both the\ntemporal order and synchronous\/asynchronous experiments were\nquantifiable despite the absence of trials where where sensory\nevents physically preceded motor actions. Small to medium sized\ndelays resulted in large numbers of \u2018event before action\u2019 responses\nacross na\u0131\u00a8ve and non-na\u0131\u00a8ve observers. Indeed, naive observers\nwere extremely surprised to learn that no trials actually included a\nsensory stimulus prior to their motor response. This highlights the\nrobustness of the effect which has now been demonstrated using a\nnumber of different experimental paradigms [1\u20133].\nReturning to the data shown in Figure 2, it seems that\ncombinations of factors are contributing to the magnitude of our\nadaptation effects. One is the lifelong experience that motor\nactions and sensory events tend to be closely associated in time.\nWhen presented with a temporal asynchrony between action and\nevent (both of which possess temporal uncertainty), a likely\ninference is that this asynchrony is the result of neural error\nindicating the need for re-calibration. This could either be\nachieved by realigning the noisy sensory estimate of delay toward\na \u2018synchrony prior\u2019 [28], changing the synchrony prior in the light\nof adaptation [29,30] or manipulating the Bayesian combination\nof both with an additional noisy estimate based on current context\n[31]. This type of sensory realignment appears in many different\nforms, but Helson\u2019s Adaptation Level Theory [32] underlies all of\nthem. This theory proposes that the current, adapted state\nprovides a sensory standard against which new stimuli are\nperceived. The result is that, in trials where the adapting stimulus\nis suddenly removed (\u2018catch\u2019 trials), significant \u2018rebound\u2019 judgment\nerrors result. Motor adaptation is commonly studied in this way,\nwith the general finding that the extent of adaptation is\nproportional to the motor disturbance introduced. In the context\nof our adaptation effects, this would suggest that temporal\nrecalibration should increase linearly with adapting delay. This\nis not the case (Figure 2), and brings us on to the second factor\ndetermining our effects.\nIn the motor domain, it has recently become evident that the\nrelevance or \u2018credibility\u2019 of disturbing forces affecting motor actions\nare taken into consideration before making adaptive changes\n[33,34]. Similarly, in the sensorimotor domain, human observers\ntypically show a rapid fall-off in their tendency to attribute sensory\nfeedback as being a consequence of their motor actions as the\ntemporal discrepancy between the two is increased [35\u201338].\nThe concept of causality appears to be critical [39], with\nHaggard et al [40] finding that the perceived times of motor\nactions and events are indeed attracted towards each other in time,\nbut that this effect dissipates rapidly with the physical delay\nbetween the two. Inspection of Haggard\u2019s data reveals that the rate\nof decline is well described by an exponential function [40]. We\ntherefore suggest that our adaptation effects decrease at long\ndelays because observers no longer consider the sensory event to\nbe a direct consequence of their action.\nOn this basis, we model our data as a combination of two\nfactors\u2013a linear increase in temporal recalibration which is\nFigure 2. Adaption shifts the point of subjective sensorimotor\nsimultaneity across the sensorimotor pairings.

Data points represent the physical sensorimotor asynchrony\nnecessary to produce perceptual synchrony (PSS). Positive values signify\na temporal lead of action over event. The data are fitted with a model\nwith two free parameters (see main text for details). Error bars represent\none standard error of the mean (variance between observers) either\nside of the parameter values (n = 5).\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0007681.g002\nEffect before Cause\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7681\nproportional to the delay, combined with an exponential reduction\nin the tendency to attribute action and event as being associated.\nThe data of Figure 2 are therefore fitted with the function\nPSS~k|delay|e\n{\ndelay\nk0\n\u0001 \u0002\nwhere k is a constant of proportionality and k\u2019 determines the rate\nof exponential decay.\nThis provides an excellent fit to the data sets for each sense.\nParameter values along with their errors and goodness-of-fit are\ngiven in Table 1. The proximity to unity of the parameter k, for all\nthree senses, indicates that temporal recalibration is virtually\ncomplete at small delays. Observers fully adapt to the delay and\nrecalibrate their sense of synchrony accordingly.\nWhilst the visuo-motor data corroborates the recent data of\nStetson et al. [1], the auditory and tactile data form the first\ndemonstration of adaptive temporal realignment of audio-motor\nand tactile-motor perception. The most striking feature of the data\nshown in Figure 2 is the similarity in the pattern of results across\nthe three sensorimotor domains. A potential explanation for\nequivalence between the modalities is a single perceptual\nmechanism that recalibrates all the sensory consequences of a\ngiven motor action. If the recalibration mechanism is manifest at a\nsufficiently late-stage of temporal processing (e.g., beyond\nmodality-specific cortical areas) the recalibration effects shown in\nFigures 1 & 2 should survive the replacement of the sensory\ncomponent between adapt and test phases. To address this\nquestion we performed a further, similar experiment where\nobservers adapted to a fixed 200 ms delay (where the adaptation\neffects shown in Figure 2 appear maximal) in one sensorimotor\npairing but their post-adaptation sensorimotor TOJs were tested\nwith a different sensorimotor pairing (e.g., adapt \u2018mousepress-\nflash\u2019, test \u2018mousepress-click\u2019) (see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 for\ndetails).\nFigure 3 shows the average PSS values extracted from the\nresultant crossmodal psychometric functions (Fig. 3 - grey bars),\nalongside the within-modality 200 ms values from Figure 2 (Fig. 3\n- yellow bars). It is clear that the recalibration effects are unaffected\nby the changeover of the sensory component between adaptation\nand test phases. The similarity between the effect size across\nconditions is confirmed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA,\nwhich revealed that the effect of test modality on PSS was\nsignificant (F2, 12 = 7.41, p = 0.008), but that the effect of the\nadapting modality was not significant (F2, 12 = 1.61, p.0.05). The\nformer reflects the fact that the magnitude of the effect was slightly,\nbut consistently, higher for the \u2018test A\u2019 condition (Figure 3B).\nCritically, however, there was no significant interaction between\nthese two factors (F4, 24 = 2.02, p.0.05). In other words, the\nmagnitude of the effect for a given test modality does not depend\non the adapting modality. Thus, adaptation to delayed sensory\nconsequences recalibrates all the sensory consequences of the\nmotor action employed in the current study.\nThus far, we have considered changes in perceived temporal\nalignment (PSS), as opposed to the sensitivity to changes in relative\ntemporal position. In the first, within-modality experiment,\nsensorimotor temporal order thresholds were not dependent on\ntest stimulus modality (F2, 8 = 1.23, p.0.05). In the crossmodal\n\u2018200 ms\u2019 condition, threshold values were not dependent on test\nmodality or adapting modality per se (F2, 12 = 0.712, p.0.05), but\nthe interaction between adapt and test modalities was significant\n(F4, 24 = 9.815, p = 0.0001). Figure 4 shows this arises from the\nnotable cost to performance when the modality of the sensory\nevent changes between adapt and test phases. This is in keeping\nwith studies showing that temporal performance is compromised\nby rapid switching of attention between the sensory modalities\n(e.g., [12,41]).\nDiscussion\nIn the current study we set out to investigate how recent\nexperience influences the nervous system\u2019s estimates of sensori-\nmotor timing across the sensory modalities. The data from the first\nexperiment clearly show that the visual, auditory and tactile\nTable 1.\nSense k k\u2019 (msec) R2\nVision 0.83160.053 264614 0.971\nAudition 0.98460.042 24268 0.983\nTouch 0.83660.048 231611 0.973\ndoi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0007681.t001\nFigure 3.

The results of the final, crossmodal experiment\nreveal that this recalibration transfers to sensorimotor pairings\nother than those included in the adaptation phase. Our data are\nwell described by a model in which an observer\u2019s prior experience\nleads them to impose perceptual synchrony between motor actions\nand their sensory consequences. One intuitively appealing feature\nof this model is that it balances the costs and benefits of\nrecalibrating perception in response to an altered physical\nenvironment. Small sensorimotor temporal delays are treated as\nimprobable, and the perceived sensorimotor timing of all potential\nsensory feedback is almost completely realigned. Increasing delays\nbetween actions and afferent sensory inputs are classified as\nexponentially more likely to have arisen from independent causes\n(i.e., external agencies), thus minimising the risk of erroneous\nadaptation.\nElements of our model have parallels with two concepts from\nthe causality literature. Firstly, the notion of an \u2018internal\ncomparison process\u2019 first postulated by Helmholtz (for a recent\nreview see [42]). Here, observers compute the difference between\nthe predicted and perceived afferent sensory feedback following\ncompletion of their motor commands (e.g., a saccade [43] or\ncontact between fingers [44]). The output of this \u2018comparator\nmodel\u2019 gives a metric of causality, and it could be argued that our\nobservers use such an output to recalibrate sensorimotor time. For\nexample, Bays et al [35] discuss a general principal of how\nprediction is employed in a variety of situations such as tactile\nforce perception. Tactile sensation is typically attenuated when it is\nassociated with self-generated actions [35,45]. Interestingly, this\nattenuation can occur without the full completion of the action,\npresumably because the nervous system makes prior assumptions\nabout the sensory consequences [44]. Secondly, an assumption of\nsynchrony also has implications for the nature of \u2018intentional\nbinding\u2019 effects described by Haggard and colleagues, in which\nobservers consistently underestimate the temporal interval be-\ntween voluntary actions and their sensory consequences (e.g.,\n[40,46]). This underestimation can be thought of as either (i) a\nlocal compression of the temporal interval between action and\nevent or, (ii) a temporal realignment (i.e. recalibration) of the\nsignals binding the interval [1]. Our adaptation data favour the\nlatter explanation because after-effects of intentional binding\nbrought about by interval compression do not predict the illusory\nreversal of temporal order observed here. Our effects strongly\nsuggest that the signals themselves are realigned rather than the\nperception of the interval between them. In the context of the\ncurrent study, it remains unknown whether such recalibration\ninvolves a forward shift in time of sensory feedback or a backward\nshift of the motor action or, indeed, a combination of the two.\nIt seems logical to speculate whether the notion of an\nassumption of synchrony is limited to the perception of\nsensorimotor timing. Whilst an afferent self-generated sensory\nsignal must be generated simultaneously with the completion of\nthe causative motor action, audio-visual signals arising from a\nproximal external source - but independently of our motor actions\n- are also likely to share a correlated temporal register [47]. We\napplied the model described above to the audio-visual data of\nFujisaki et al. [7], where audio-visual PSS was systematically\nmapped-out as a function of the magnitude of the adapting\nasynchrony. These data are shown in Figure 5. Clearly, Fujisaki et\nal\u2019s audiovisual effects are well described by this model\n(R2 = 0.943). Whilst the optimum exponent for this data set was\nsimilar to that found for our sensorimotor data (291649 msec), a\nmuch smaller constant of proportionality is present (0.2560.05).\nThe smaller constant of proportionality perhaps suggests a weaker\nassumption of synchrony for sensory-sensory stimuli than for\nsensorimotor stimuli. Whilst the seen and heard components of\naudio-visual events will be generated simultaneously, they\nregularly arrive at their receptor surfaces with significant physical\nasynchrony (e.g. when observer-event distance is relatively large\n[5]). This provides an interesting avenue for future work. Audio-\ntactile and visuo-tactile signals are not subject to the significant\nenvironmental delays affecting their audiovisual counterparts. If\nlong-term experience of this relationship drives a stronger\nassumption of synchrony between the signals, we would expect\ndifferences in the relationship between the extent of the\nrecalibration and adapting asynchrony (e.g. Fig. 5) across the\ndifferent multisensory pairings.\nThe nature of our adaptation effects is likely to have\nimplications for their neural locus. The twin findings that (i) in\nterms of amplitude and tuning, all three sensorimotor pairings are\nrecalibrated in a very similar manner and (ii) the illusion transfers\nto un-adapted sensorimotor pairings, strongly suggests that our\neffects are mediated at a relatively late-stage in the sensory and\/or\nFigure 4.

It seems reasonable to assume that the\nneural architecture subserving these effects is most likely located\nbeyond the level of modality-specific brain areas [16].\nIn summary, our data suggest that temporal recalibration occurs\nbecause actions and their sensory consequences \u2018should\u2019 feel\nsynchronous [48]. When this a priori assumption about the external\nworld is combined with noisy sensorimotor estimates, adaptation\ninitiates a realignment of our perception away from veridicality\nand toward the temporal relationship experienced during\nadaptation. Importantly, this only occurs when the nervous system\ncan be confident that sensory inputs are a product of its own motor\ncommands. Temporal discrepancies between motor actions and\nsensory events have been shown to be a powerful metric in the\nperception of causality [35,36,49] and the strength of this\nassociation declines exponentially with time [40]. This makes\nsense if the nervous system seeks to avoid potentially dangerous\nrecalibration between our motor actions and sensory events with\nindependent, external causes. An interesting direction for future\nwork would be to use our paradigm to probe sensorimotor\nrecalibration in schizophrenic patients with delusions of control.\nThe work of two recent studies suggests that the temporal tuning of\nour effects (Fig. 2) may be considerably more narrow as a result of\ntheir tendency to attribute external causalities to internally generated\nstimuli [43,45]. By the same token, it would be of interest to\nexamine whether adaptive sensorimotor recalibration occurs when\nobservers attempt to interpret actions and sensory consequences,\nbut where the actions are generated by external agencies [24,44].\nMaterials and Methods\nObservers\nFive trained observers (3 authors plus 2 na\u0131\u00a8ve) participated in\nthe within-modality experiments, whereas seven trained observers\n(3 authors, plus 4 na\u0131\u00a8ve) participated in the crossmodal\nexperiment. All experiments were run with the permission of\nThe University of Bradford\u2019s ethics committee after gaining\ninformed, written consent from all observers (in accordance with\nthe Declaration of Helsinki).\nStimuli\nVisual stimulation was provided by a small (1.05u diameter)\ngreen LED (luminous intensity 600 cd\/m2), auditory stimulation\nby a white noise burst (70 dB SPL), and tactile stimulation by a tap\non the left forefinger delivered via an electrical solenoid. All stimuli\nwere contained within 10 ms square wave-windowed temporal\nprofiles. The relative timings of motor action and sensory stimuli\nwere verified by simultaneous capture on a multiple trace\noscilloscope. Auditory stimuli were delivered binaurally via tightly\nfitting, pinna-enclosing headphones (Sennheiser HD650). These\nheadphones were worn by all observers for all experiments\nensuring that the operational noise of the mousepress (see below)\nand solenoid remained inaudible to observers. The generation and\npresentation of all stimuli was controlled via custom-written\nsoftware run in MatLab (Mathworks, U.S.A.) via a desktop PC.\nProcedures\nDuring the experiment, observers were instructed to fixate the\ncentre of the LED and press the mouse button at a pace of their\nown choosing. After each of the first four mousepresses, a stimulus\nwas presented (\u2018flash\u2019, \u2018click\u2019 or \u2018tap\u2019) at a constant delay of either\n25, 50, 100, 200, 400 or 800 ms (\u2018adapting\u2019 presentations). For all\nexperiments this delay was consistent during a given experimental\nrun. After the fifth mousepress, the same stimulus was presented\nwith a delay of 25, 50, 75, 100, or 125 ms, which varied randomly\nwithin a method of constant stimuli (\u2018test\u2019 presentation). Observers\nwere required to judge whether the fifth stimulus presentation\nappeared before or after the fifth buttonpress, and make an\nunspeeded, binary forced-choice response via a computer\nkeyboard. This response initiated the next cycle of adapting and\ntest stimuli. Each of the five test delays was tested 10 times within\nan experimental run. Observers completed five runs for each of\nthe three sensorimotor pairings tested, making a total of 750 test\npresentations per observer (10 presentations* 5 runs* 5 test delays\n* 3 sensorimotor pairings). The order of these runs was\nrandomised so that each 10 repetition run was equally likely to\ncontain any of the five different adapting delays.\nThe resultant psychometric functions (Fig. 1A) were fitted with a\nlogistic function of the form\ny~\n100\n1ze{\nx{u\u00f0 \u00de\nh\nwhere m is the sensorimotor asynchrony value corresponding to the\nPSS (the 50% response level on the psychometric function), and h\nprovides an estimate of temporal order threshold (approximately\nhalf the offset between the 27% and 73% response levels). In this\nway, PSS values were obtained for all observers in all of the\nconditions (Fig. 2).\nThe second, control experiment was identical to the audio-\nmotor section of first experiment with the exception that observers\nchanged their judgment type from \u2018which came first, action or\nevent?\u2019 to \u2018were action and event synchronous or asynchronous?\u2019\nThe resultant data were fitted with Gaussian functions (Fig. 1B) of\nthe form\ny~k|e\n{\nx{u\u00f0 \u00de2\n2s2\nFigure 5.

The PSS and threshold values\nfrom these conditions are shown in Figures 3 and 4 respectively.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Danting Liu for help with data collection and\nWaka Fujisaki for supplying the data used in Figure 5.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: JH JVMH DW.
