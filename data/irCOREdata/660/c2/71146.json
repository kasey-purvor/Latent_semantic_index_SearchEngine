Box 3000, FIN-90014, University of Oulu, Finland\nReceived: 1 March 2004 \u2013 Revised: 8 November 2004 \u2013 Accepted: 9 November 2004 \u2013 Published: 31 January 2005\nPart of Special Issue \u201cEleventh International EISCAT Workshop\u201d\nAbstract. This paper presents the first direct empirical ev-\nidence that mesoscale variations in ion velocities must be\ntaken into consideration when calculating Joule heating and\nrelating it to changes in ion temperatures and momentum\ntransfer to the neutral gas. The data come from the first\ntristatic Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) measurements of\nthe neutral atmosphere co-located with tristatic measure-\nments of the ionosphere made by the European Incoher-\nent Scatter (EISCAT) radar which were carried out during\nthe nights of 27\u201328 February 2003 and 28 February until\n1 March 2003. Tristatic measurements mean that there are no\nassumptions of uniform wind fields and ion drifts, nor zero\nvertical winds. The independent, tristatic, thermospheric\nmeasurements presented here should provide unambiguous\nvector wind information, and hence reduce the need to sup-\nplement observations with information obtained from mod-\nels of the neutral atmosphere, or with estimates of neutral\nparameters derived from ionospheric measurements. These\nnew data can also test the assumptions used in models and in\nion-neutral interactions. The FPIs are located close to the\n3 radars of the EISCAT configuration in northern Scandi-\nnavia, which is a region well covered by a network of com-\nplementary instruments. These provide a larger scale context\nwithin which to interpret our observations of mesoscale vari-\nations on the scales of tens of kilometres spatially and min-\nutes temporally. Initial studies indicate that the thermosphere\nis more dynamic and responsive to ionospheric forcing than\nexpected.

At times it either enhanced or re-\nduced the effective electric field by up to several tens of per-\ncent. The tristatic experiment also presents the first valida-\ntion of absolute temperature measurements from a common\nvolume observed by independently calibrated FPIs. Com-\nparison of EISCAT ion temperatures at an altitude of 240 km\nwith FPI neutral temperatures show that Ti was around 200 K\nbelow Tn for nearly 3 h on the first night during a period of\nstrong geomagnetic activity. This is inconsistent with en-\nergy transfer. Comparison with FPI temperatures from sur-\nrounding regions indicate that it could not be accounted for\nby height variations. Indeed, these first results seem to in-\ndicate that the 630-nm emission did not stray too far from\n240 km. There were also apparent drops in Te at the same\ntime as the anomalous Ti values which are energetically\nimplausible. Incorrect assumptions of composition or non-\nMaxwellian spectra are likely to be the problem.\nKey words. Ionosphere (Auroral ionosphere; Electric fields\nand currents; Ionosphere-atmosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nThis is a unique experiment where a common volume is ob-\nserved by the EISCAT radar and 3 FPIs to permit indepen-\ndent and tristatic measurements of the ionosphere and ther-\nmosphere, respectively.

The majority\nof previous ground-based experiments mainly investigated\nlarge-scale behaviour over a region of hundreds of kilome-\ntres using a single FPI with a radar (e.g. Cierpka et al., 2000;\nAruliah and Griffin, 2001; Sakonoi et al., 2002). There are\nonly a small number of published meso-scale investigations\nusing two FPIs in close proximity (i.e. Greet et al., 1999;\nIshii et al., 2001).\nAt present the mainland EISCAT radar is the only radar\nin the world that makes true tristatic observations of the\nionosphere. This is achieved using a transmitter\/receiver at\nTroms\u00f8 and receivers at Kiruna and Sodankyla\u00a8. Other radars\nderive plasma velocities using a single transmitter\/receiver\nand rely on beam-swinging techniques with the assump-\ntion that the plasma velocity field is unchanged between\ntwo directions of observation. The limitations of the beam-\nswinging technique are presented by Etemadi et al. (1989)\nand are particularly pertinent since the small-scale variability\nof the ionosphere has now become a prime concern. Merg-\ning and reconnection of the solar wind with the geomagnetic\nfield is no longer seen to be a steady-state phenomenon, but\na series of irregular pulsed events resulting in highly variable\nplasma velocities (Lockwood et al., 1995). A major short-\ncoming of the models is that there are large disparities in\nthe values of neutral winds and temperatures between model\ncalculations and observations. The general circulation mod-\nels (GCMs) use large-scale averaged electric fields and par-\nticle precipitation models which result in too much momen-\ntum transferred to the neutral gas, and too little Joule heat-\ning at high-latitudes. Put simply, the effect of applying a\nconstant drag term (albeit a smaller force than the instanta-\nneous force) compared with a semi-random force vector that\nswings rapidly about a near zero average value, results in a\nbuilding up of velocities which are not observed in the real\natmosphere. Similarly, the heating effect of a smoothly aver-\naged plasma flow is significantly smaller than that of a ran-\ndomly varying flow. The lack of consideration of small-scale\nvariability is a serious limitation of the models and conse-\nquently an important new area of investigation.\nPapers are beginning to appear that show that the high-\nlatitude thermosphere also has small-scale variability (e.g.\nConde et al., 2001; Aruliah and Griffin, 2001; Aruliah et al.,\n2004) and in particular with connection to gravity waves (In-\nnis and Conde, 2002). This is important since the neutral\nwinds and temperatures appear in several fundamental equa-\ntions for ion-neutral dynamics and energetics. Unfortunately,\nthe main sources of observation of the neutral component of\nthe upper atmosphere are passive, such as optical emissions\nwhich are all spatially and temporarily localised, and satel-\nlite drag, which has its own spatial and temporal sacrifices\nin order to obtain global coverage. Consequently, the lack of\navailable thermospheric data has meant that assumptions are\nfrequently used instead of observations. As a result the as-\nsumptions of a slowly varying inertial medium are ingrained\nand the need for contemporaneous data collection is often\noverlooked. However, the substitution of model data brings\nproblems, since models are an excellent tool for understand-\ning general mechanisms, but are inadequate as a replacement\nsince they will propagate the limitations of their assumptions.\nEven empirical models can only substitute for generic clima-\ntology studies.\n2 The tristatic experiment\nThe first tristatic campaign was held during the period 16:30\u2013\n04:30 UT on the nights of 27\u201328 February 2003 and 28\nFebruary until 1 March 2003. Figure 1 shows the location\nof the instruments in the auroral zone in Northern Scandi-\nnavia. The FPIs observe the red line emission at 630 nm of\natomic oxygen which is the second most dominant nighttime\nauroral and airglow emission after the green line emission at\n557.7 nm, in the visible region. The height of the red line\nemission peak intensity is around 240 km (e.g. Solomon et\nal., 1988), thus the Doppler shifts and Doppler broadening\nof the emission allows for the calculation of the wind speeds\nand temperatures of the upper thermosphere.\nThe three FPIs are at the Sodankyla\u00a8 Geophysical Ob-\nservatory in Finland (67.4\u25e6 N, 26.6\u25e6 E), Skibotn in Nor-\nway (69.3\u25e6 N, 20.4\u25e6 E) and the Kiruna Esrange Optical Site\n(KEOPS) in Sweden (67.8\u25e6 N, 20.4\u25e6 E). Each FPI observes\na 1\u25e6 field-of-view at an elevation angle of 45\u25e6 for the So-\ndankyla\u00a8 and KEOPS FPIs, and 51.5\u25e6 for the Skibotn FPI.\nA scanning mirror turns to allow for observation to the north,\neast, south, west and zenith, thus providing a large-scale con-\ntext by creating a grid of FPI observations of winds, temper-\natures and intensities. The circles define the viewing area of\nA. L. Aruliah et al.: First direct evidence of meso-scale variability on ion-neutral dynamics 149\neach FPI, assuming an emission height of 240 km. Two fur-\nther positions are observed: position A is the tristatic com-\nmon volume, where the fields-of-view of all three FPIs over-\nlap, and position B is a bistatic common volume seen by the\nKEOPS and Sodankyla FPIs. As can be seen from Fig. 1,\nthere are also other points where more than one FPI can view\nvolumes that are in close proximity, such as KEOPS zenith\nwith Sodankyla\u00a8 west and Skibotn south viewing volumes.\nThe EISCAT radar was in CP1-like mode. The CP1 mode\nis a fixed transmitter beam in the field-aligned direction,\nhowever, in this experiment the beam and the two receivers\nare not field-aligned, but are aimed at the common volume A\n(69.4\u25e6 N, 25.0\u25e6 E), to make tristatic measurements. Further\ndetails of the operation of the FPIs may be found in Aruliah\nand Griffin (2001), and of the EISCAT radar in Rishbeth and\nWilliams (1985).\nThe FPIs are not cross calibrated for intensity and so each\nhas been scaled to match the KEOPS FPI intensity in the fig-\nures shown in this paper. Each FPI is of a different age and\nthere are different detector sensitivities. Detector technology\nhas progressed rapidly over the 10 years since the Skibotn\nFPI was built. The Skibotn FPI (intensified EEV detector)\nhas an integration time of 60 s, while the Sodankyla\u00a8 (EEV\ndetector) and KEOPS (Andor detector) FPI have 40 and 20 s,\nrespectively. Consequently the time resolution to complete a\ncycle of observations is 3.5 min and 8.5 min for the KEOPS\nand Sodankyla\u00a8 FPIs, respectively. The Skibotn FPI has a\ncycle time of 13.9 min, however, the tristatic A position is\nviewed twice in each cycle to improve the time resolution.\nThe reason for the low time resolution is that the Skibotn\nFPI has a longer dead time owing to its more complex me-\nchanical system which includes additional mirror elevation\ncontrol. This accounts for why the Skibotn FPI misses the\nvariability and dramatic peaks in intensity seen by the other\n2 FPIs and also misses out on data when the signal-to-noise\nratio is too poor. The intensities of the Sodankyla\u00a8 and Ski-\nbotn FPIs have been scaled to the KEOPS intensities by mul-\ntiplying by factors of 11.4 and 1.49, respectively. Having\nscaled the data, the difference in intensities can be attributed\nto several possible contributions:\n1. Longer FPI integration times and lower time resolutions\nsmooth out the sharp peaks and troughs seen by the\nhighest resolution FPI at KEOPS.\n2. If the emission peak height is greater or smaller than\n240 km, the line-of-sight observing volume of each FPI\nwill over- or undershoot A and so there is no longer a\ncommon volume.\n3. The height integrated intensities from the 3 FPI view-\npoints are different,owing to the variations in the emis-\nsion profiles over the fields-of-view.\n4. Cloud scatter.\nComparison of the intensities and temperatures of all the\nlook directions allow for an investigation of variability on\nscales of tens of kilometres to a few hundred kilometres.\nThe spatial scale size of the thermosphere will determine\nwhether (b) and (c) make much difference to the height-\nintegrated intensity. Current models such as the GLOW\nmodel (Solomon et al., 1988) have too coarse a spatial resolu-\ntion, owing to their dependence on parameters derived from\nglobal models, such as the International Reference Iono-\nsphere (IRI) (Bilitza, 1997) and MSIS (Picone et al., 2002),\nto show any significant variation for less than 5 \u25e6 latitude.\nThis is a severe limitation of global models, since the upper\natmosphere at high-latitudes is highly spatially variable, and\nthe region covered by the 3 FPIs is around 6\u25e6 latitude by 18\u25e6\nlongitude. As an example, this region would be represented\nby only 3 points in the CTIP model, which currently has a\nspatial resolution of 2\u25e6 latitude by 18\u25e6 longitude (e.g. Mill-\nward et al., 1996). However, the model\u2019s spatial limitation\ncan be helped by using a 1-min time step and equating Local\nTime variations with longitude variations.\nThe geometry of the location of the FPIs is not ideal. The\nbest configuration would be for the 3 FPIs to be at the cor-\nners of an equilateral pyramid with the common volume at\nthe apex. The FPI geometry is determined by the location of\nthe facilities of the three geophysical institutes housing the\nEISCAT radars. The Skibotn FPI points almost to the east\nto view the tristatic A position. As a result, it measures an\nextremely small meridional component. Thus, the tristatic\nzonal component is reliable, while the meridional compo-\nnent is dominated by the KEOPS and Sodankyla\u00a8 line-of-sight\nmeasurements and shows a poor match with the bistatic cal-\nculation and therefore is not shown. The inversion of the\ntristatic matrix produces a poor determination of the vertical\ncomponent since it is much smaller than the other two com-\nponents, and this also is not shown. The equations used to\ndetermine the tristatic vector are given in the Appendix.\nFor each FPI the winds are calculated by observing the\nshift of the 630-nm peaks from a zero Doppler shift peak\nposition. Since there is no convenient laboratory source of\n630 nm, it is necessary to determine the zero Doppler shift\nposition by using the vertical observation and a neon calibra-\ntion lamp observation. The calibration lamp also provides a\nmeasure of the stability of the FPI to fluctuations in ambi-\nent conditions. The wavelength of the neon calibration lamp\nis 630.4 nm and so cannot be used as the zero Doppler shift\nposition. Instead, the assumption is made that the average\nvertical wind over a complete night is zero, which roughly\ncomplies with the conservation of mass law, i.e. there is no\nnet loss of mass at a given height over a 24-h period. The\nlonger the night, the more valid the assumption. Once the\nmean nighttime offset of the vertical emission peak from the\ncalibration lamp peak is calculated, the offset is added to the\ncalibration lamp peak to create a zero Doppler shift peak po-\nsition throughout the night. Further discussion of the vertical\nwind is given in the following section.\nThis tristatic campaign is the first experiment that has al-\nlowed for cross-calibration for thermospheric neutral temper-\natures. Neutral temperatures are derived from the Doppler\nbroadening of the 630-nm emission line. The instrument\nfunction needs to be derived using a laser profile and\n150 A. L.

Two of the FPIs,\nSkibotn and Sodankyla\u00a8, were absolutely calibrated using He-\nNe laser profiles. As the KEOPS FPI was not absolutely cal-\nibrated the measurements must be offset to produce agree-\nment.\nNeutral temperatures determined in this way may differ\nfrom the ambient thermospheric temperature if there is a\nsignificant contribution to the overall intensity from non-\nthermalised atomic oxygen. This would artificially increase\nthe observed temperature, as demonstrated by Shematovich\net al. (1999). Sipler and Biondi (2003), however, have shown\nthat in their FPI Doppler temperature analysis, the contribu-\ntion of the non-thermalised component of the total emission\nwas always less than 20 K, i.e. much less than their error\nestimates, for a range of solar activity conditions. Further,\nthe main contribution to the temperature increase was from\nhigher altitudes, above the peak emission height.\nWe have used the combination of instruments available for\nthe current tristatic arrangement to demonstrate that for the\nmajority of the time our peak altitude appeared to be close to\nour nominal 240-km peak height. This should ensure that we\ndid not suffer from a significant contribution to the Doppler\ntemperature from non-thermalised emission. However, we\nare aware that the Sipler and Biondi (2003) conclusions were\nfor mid-latitudes and that while the analysis techniques are\nessentially similar, the details may alter the impact of the\nnon-thermal emission, so we are working to simulate these\neffects for our specific technique.\n3 Meso-scale variability of the high-latitude thermo-\nsphere\n3.1 Variability of thermospheric winds\nFigure 2a shows the calculated zonal wind component for\nposition A on the night of 27\u201328 February 2003. A compar-\nison is made between the true tristatic calculation that uses\nthe line-of-sight winds from all 3 FPIs and the bistatic cal-\nculation that uses the 2 FPIs with the highest time resolution\n(KEOPS and Sodankyla\u00a8). The bistatic calculation requires\nthe assumption that the vertical wind component is zero to\nsolve the equations. This is a commonly used assumption\nbased on the observation that the vertical wind component is\non average an order of magnitude smaller than the horizon-\ntal component. The discrepancy of up to 50 m\/s between the\ntristatic and bistatic wind values is more due to the failure of\nthis assumption rather than because the three FPIs are not ob-\nserving a common volume. Figure 2b shows the individual\nvertical components measured above each of the FPI sites.\nThe location of the FPIs are such that Skibotn and KEOPS\nare at the same geographic longitude, separated by about\n250 km, while KEOPS and Sodankyla\u00a8 are at the same geo-\ngraphic latitude, also separated by about 250 km. As noted\nearlier, the sensitivities of the FPIs were different, hence the\nvarious time resolutions. Inspection of the vertical wind plot\nshows that the winds were individually highly variable over\nthis small area. The vertical winds ranged between \u00b150 m\/s,\nwith a few excursions to a maximum of 120 m\/s upwards at\n03:26 UT. The wind error is dependent on the signal-to-noise\nratio, thus the vertical wind error bars were \u00b110 m\/s up to\nmidnight when the intensities were high. After midnight they\nrose to around \u00b120 m\/s on average as the intensities became\nlow.\nThe error due to a change in the peak emission height may\nbe estimated by using the line-of-sight winds from the cardi-\nnal point observations, to determine the gradient of the wind\nfield. Taking a possible extreme value, if the emission height\nwas 50 km higher than 240 km and the line-of sight volumes\nover-reached position A, then the average change in the mag-\nnitude of the wind for this night would have been only around\n10 m\/s. Thus, the difference between the tristatic and bistatic\ncalculations was mainly due to the vertical wind assumption.\nSimilar trends in the nighttime variation of the vertical\nwinds were seen independently in each of the data sets, es-\npecially the large upwelling at 22:00 UT which was oc-\ncurred when an auroral arc passed through this region. The\nvertical wind seen by both the KEOPS and Skibotn FPIs\naround this time rose sharply to around 100 m\/s. Prior to the\nA. L. Aruliah et al.: First direct evidence of meso-scale variability on ion-neutral dynamics 151\nupwelling, Skibotn showed strong downwelling to a maxi-\nmum of \u221278 m\/s at 21:16 UT while KEOPS and Sodankyla\u00a8\nshowed smaller downwelling during all or part of the period\nbetween 21:00\u201322:00 UT.\nThese are very large vertical winds but similar sized verti-\ncal winds at high latitudes have been reported by other work-\ners (e.g. Price et al., 1995). Earlier observations were treated\nwith scepticism, owing to the consideration of the large ener-\ngies required to move the atmosphere vertically. Shinagawa\net al. (2003) carried out a modelling study of vertical winds\ngenerated by a moving auroral arc based on an EISCAT ex-\nperiment. The study produced maximum vertical winds of\n20 m\/s which were less than the observed winds. This will\nbe discussed in the section on ion-neutral coupling below.\nThe large upwelling resulted in a single data point indicat-\ning a sharp drop of nearly 100\u00b132 m\/s in the tristatic zonal\nwind component at 22:00 UT. The tristatic winds were cal-\nculated with a resolution of 15 min, which is around the time\ntaken for this rapid velocity spike to occur. However, the time\nresolution of the KEOPS line-of-sight measurements was far\nhigher, as shown in Fig. 3. There were 6 data points between\n21:54\u201322:12 UT from the KEOPS tristatic A measurements,\nwith an error of \u00b116 m\/s, which clearly show that this was a\nreal geophysical observation rather than due to instrumental\nor observational error.\nConde and Smith (1998) show a similar drop in the hor-\nizontal wind field accompanying an upwelling which they\nhave called the \u201cdoldrums\u201d. They suggest that this is the re-\nsult of the advection of low velocity gas from the E-region up\nto the F-region. If this is the case, it might be expected that\nthe upwelling gas package would carry E-region tempera-\ntures, but cooler due to adiabatic expansion. The radar mea-\nsurements of Ti in the E-region were\u223c500 K which would be\nindicative of Tn at this altitude. The Sodankyla\u00a8 FPI tristatic\nA measurements showed no particular trends in Tn around\nthis time that might indicate the intrusion of an E-region gas\nparcel. The FPI measurements of neutral temperature are\ndescribed in more detail in the temperatures section below.\nFurthermore, the main Joule heating at 22:00 UT was in the\nF-region where Ne and hence the conductivity was highest.\nThus, there would have been little reason for a gas parcel to\nrise to the hotter F-region altitudes from the E-region through\nbuoyancy alone.\nHowever, both the Sodankyla\u00a8 tristatic A and North mea-\nsurements of Tn showed a larger average Tn in the period\nof the upwelling, i.e. <Tn>=1152 K (tristatic A) and 1132 K\n(North) for the period 22:00\u201322:30 UT. This was followed by\na drop in the average temperature to <Tn>=1062 K (tristatic\nA) and 1045 K (North) for the period 22:30\u201323:00 UT fol-\nlowed by a rise back up to 1102 K (tri A) and 1078 K (North)\nfor the period 23:00\u201323:30 UT. This temperature trend was\nalso seen in the KEOPS tristatic A Tn measurements, al-\nthough the magnitudes involved are unresolved as the tem-\nperatures have not been calibrated. So it may be possi-\nble that the drop in temperature can be interpreted as evi-\ndence of cooler E-region gas which took half an hour to cool\nthe F-region by nearly 100 K. These temperature data are\nFig. 3. Comparison of the EISCAT northward component of the\nfield-perpendicular ion velocity (left-hand scale) with the KEOPS\nFPI line-of-sight thermospheric wind (right-hand scale). The rapid\nthermospheric response to the ion velocity spike was largely due to\na large upwelling caused by Joule heating as shown in Fig. 2b.\npresented later in this paper under the section for ion-neutral\ncoupling.\nAlternately, instead of considering a dip in temperature\naround 23:30 UT, the temperatures around 22:00 UT and\n23:00 UT could probably represent temperature rises due to\nheating and they do indeed match with peaks in the 630-nm\nintensities when there was particle precipitation.\nThe last evidence against the doldrums theory for explain-\ning this behaviour comes from taking all the KEOPS az-\nimuthal line-of-sight winds and calculating the horizontal\nwind field using the KEOPS zenith observation to give al-\nlowance for the vertical wind component. There does not\nappear to have been any distinct drop-off in speed that might\nindicate an upwelling from the E-region. Instead, this seems\nto have been a typical diverging wind field.\nFigure 2b illustrates that the assumption of a zero ver-\ntical wind at any one time is not correct, however, over\na whole night the assumption is adequate for determining\na zero Doppler position. The reliability of this procedure\ndepends on the geomagnetic activity during the night. As\nshown by Aruliah and Rees (1995), the average nighttime\nvertical wind is zero for geomagnetically quiet conditions,\nbut tends to have a small upward value during active condi-\ntions when the auroral region suffers from sustained periods\nof upwelling due to Joule heating. This is likely to intro-\nduce a systematic offset of \u223c5 m\/s. So it is gratifying to\nsee that the 3 independently calibrated FPIs showed simi-\nlar trends and variations in the vertical winds throughout the\nnight despite sampling different regions of the upper atmo-\nsphere above each site. This indicates that the procedure used\nto determine the zero Doppler baseline is adequate.\nFigure 3 shows that the large upwelling in the vertical wind\naround 22:00 UT corresponded to an extremely large and\nsudden increase in the ion velocity to around 5000 m\/s for\nthe northward component in the plane perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field. The grey line shows the ion velocity V and\nthe black line shows the neutral windU . Note that the neutral\n152 A. L.

The ion velocity scale is to the left and the neutral wind\nscale to the right of the graph.\nThe neutral wind response to the sudden momentary ion\nvelocity increase was more rapid than expected, although it\nwas mainly in the vertical component rather than horizontal,\nas shown by Fig. 2b. It is interesting that the effect of this\nsudden increase lingered in the neutral winds for a few ten\u2019s\nof minutes, as can be seen by the slow decline in the wind\nmagnitude.\nPrice et al. (1995) have suggested that the sudden appear-\nance of vertical winds may be caused by the advection of\nregions of upwelling into the field-of-view of their FPI rather\nthan a sudden upward acceleration. It is possible that the si-\nmultaneous surge in ion velocity and neutral wind upwelling\nobserved in Fig. 3 may be a coincidence rather than a cause\nand effect. In order to test this it would be necessary to de-\ntermine the vertical wind field over the region covered by\nthe FPIs. However, our own observations and previous stud-\nies (Crickmore, 1993) have already indicated that the scale\nsize for the upper thermospheric vertical winds appears to\nbe only a few 100 km in the auroral region. This makes us\nwary of extrapolating the zenith winds observed over the FPI\nsites out to the edges of the viewing circles which have a pre-\nsumed radius of 240 km. However, the sudden increase and\nlingering decrease in the neutral wind seem more likely to\nbe a response to a surge of ion drag forcing than a passing of\nregion of upwelling, which might be expected to have a more\nsmoothly varying effect. Another point is that the upwelling\nis seen simultaneously at both KEOPS and Skibotn, which lie\nalong the same meridian. There is no indication of the possi-\nbility of a zonally travelling front of upwelling appearing at\nSodankyla\u00a8, which is west of KEOPS, before (for a westward\ntravelling front) or after (eastward) 22:00 UT. Further work\narising from this experiment will combine modelling studies\nwith these data to help resolve the issues uncovered.\nThe sudden increase in ion velocities was due to the pres-\nence of high electric fields within auroral arcs during a sub-\nstorm expansion. Figure 4 gives an indication of the geo-\nmagnetic activity conditions on the night of 27\u201328 February\n2003 by showing the perturbation of the Bx component of\nthe geomagnetic field observed by the IMAGE magnetome-\nter chain. The response of the general ionospheric electron\ndensity distribution to the increased geomagnetic activity is\nshown in the sequence of three tomographic images in Fig. 5.\nThe first image at 19:57 UT (Fig. 5a), before the time of in-\ncreased activity, shows the increased electron densities of the\nauroral region in the northern field-of-view, with evidence of\na boundary blob at the equatorward edge around 77\u201378\u25e6 N.\nBy the next tomographic image at 21:45 UT (Fig. 5b) the au-\nroral structure was essentially south of 77\u25e6 N and extended to\nthe low-latitude extreme of the field-of-view. A slight pole-\nward retreat of the increased densities had occured by the\ntomographic image at 23:32 UT (Fig. 5c).\n3.2 Ion-neutral coupling: first empirical confirmation of\nthe importance of variability to Joule heating\nIt should be noted that average electric field models such\nas the Millstone Hill model (e.g. Foster, 1983) use average\nplasma velocities from the Millstone Hill radar smoothed\nover 2.5 h to calculate V\u00d7B. A more recent electric field\nmodel by Weimer (1995) fits a spherical harmonic func-\ntion to binned satellite measurements. The consequence of\nsuch smoothed electric fields when used in GCMs is that too\nmuch momentum is transferred to the neutral gas at high lat-\nitudes, resulting in winds that are up to two times larger than\nmeasured by FPIs (Aruliah and Griffin, 2001; Griffin et al.,\n2004), and too little heat is generated, resulting in tempera-\ntures that are hundreds of Kelvin smaller than measured by\nFPIs (Killeen et al., 1995). This has already been recognised\nas a problem and Codrescu et al. (2000) have addressed the\ntemperature discrepancy by calculating the variability of the\nMillstone Hill plasma velocities and adding this as a param-\neter to the Foster average electric field model. However, it is\nproposed that Codrescu\u2019s analysis of the standard deviation\nmay be a major underestimate of Joule heating since:\n1.

The heating effect of particle precipitation should also\nbe considered. Satellite particle sensors with a finite\ntime resolution, limited spectral energy resolution and\nrange sample a complex 3-D pattern of precipitation via\na 1-D cut over a limited geographic trajectory. These\nmeasurements are then converted into global particle\nprecipitation models used in the GCMs. Although ex-\ntremely useful for climatology studies, they suffer from\nthe limitation of being a low resolution spatial average\nof what are highly localised heating phenomena. Thus,\nsmall-scale heating effects are likely to be severely un-\nderestimated.\nAll the high-latitude electric field models ignore the neu-\ntral wind dynamo because at high latitudes the neutral wind\ndynamo, is assumed to be an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe magnetospheric dynamo (e.g. Mozer, 1973). However,\nthe neutral wind speeds in the upper atmosphere are an or-\nder of magnitude larger than in the E-region, owing to the\nreduced densities and consequently fewer collisions in the\nupper atmosphere, and can reach a few hundreds of m\/s in\nmagnitude (Killeen et al., 1995; Aruliah et al., 1996).\n154 A. L. Aruliah et al.: First direct evidence of meso-scale variability on ion-neutral dynamics\nThe plots in Fig. 6 show a comparison of the F-region neu-\ntral wind dynamo (U\u00d7B) with the magnetospheric dynamo\n(V\u00d7B). The magnetospheric dynamo field was calculated\nusing both the 1-min average V and the 15-min average. The\n1-min average V was large and highly variable while, obvi-\nously, the 15-min average was fairly smoothly varying. The\nF-region neutral wind dynamo was also smoothly varying\nand had a magnitude that was significant in size compared\nwith the 15-min average V\u00d7B. The average magnitude of\nU\u00d7B was 50% ofV\u00d7B during 27\u201328 February 2003, which\nis consistent with Killeen et al. (1984).\nThe important point of Fig. 6 is that the neutral wind had\na steadily varying value through the night while the 1-min\naverage values of the ion velocities had large erratic varia-\ntions. This is implied by the dynamo electric fields. The\nconsequence is that the random nature of the ion velocities\nand therefore ion drag will produce a smaller acceleration of\nthe neutral gas than predicted by model simulations that use\nsteady-state electric fields.\nFigure 7a shows the Skibotn and KEOPS FPI neutral tem-\nperatures at the tristatic A position which is presumed to\nbe at an altitude of 240 km. These temperatures are com-\npared with EISCAT ion temperatures at two altitudes 245 km\nand 294 km, for 27\u201328 February 2003. Figure 7b shows\nthe corresponding Joule heating calculations. In particular,\nFig. 7b shows the large difference introduced by including\nionospheric variability into the calculation of Joule heating\nin the F-region. Thus, two sets of values representing Joule\nheating are plotted for the period 18:00\u201324:00 UT for the\nnight of 27\u201328 February 2003. Joule heating is assumed to\nbe proportional to Ne*E2perp, where Ne is the electron den-\nsity, which represents the conductivity, and Eperp is the mag-\nnitude of the electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field\ndirection. The black and grey lines show the Joule heating\nterm calculated using 15-min and 1-min averaged values, re-\nspectively, of V , to determine E=V\u00d7B.\nThere was a dramatic difference between the Joule heat-\ning calculated using the 1-min and 15-min averages. There\nwere six peaks (at 18:30 UT, 19:45 UT, 20:15 UT, 20:45 UT\n22:00 UT and 23:30 UT) in Joule heating using the 1-min\naverages and only 3 peaks (at 20:45 UT, 22:00 UT and\n22:45 UT) using the 15-min averages. The size of the 1-min\naverage Joule heating term indicates that Joule heating can\nbe grossly underestimated by ignoring the variability of the\nion velocities. The median of the ratios of the 1-min to\n15-min Joule heating measurements over the whole night is\naround 320%. Figure 7a shows that during the period 18:00\u2013\n19:00 UT the ion temperature rose sharply from 1200 K to\nover 1600 K before dropping quickly down. This seems to\nshow a clear correspondence with a peak in the 1-min Joule\nheating term (Fig. 7b), while there was no corresponding in-\ncrease in the 15-min Joule heating term.\nWhat is interesting is that there does not appear to be such\na clear correspondence between Joule heating and Ti for the\nsubsequent peaks. However, we would suggest that this is\ndue to the breakdown of the assumptions used to calculate\nTi for the period 20:00\u201324:00 UT, resulting in anomalous\nFig. 7.

This is discussed in the following section\nabout temperatures.\nFurther support for the importance of mesoscale variabil-\nity is that the period of large Joule heating values between\n21:30\u201322:30 UT corresponded to high vertical winds of up\nto 100 m\/s, seen independently by the KEOPS and Skibotn\nFPIs. As stated previously, Shinagawa et al. (2003) car-\nried out a modelling study of vertical winds generated by\na moving auroral arc based on an EISCAT experiment by\nOyama et al. (2001). The study produced maximum verti-\ncal winds of 20 m\/s, which were considerably less than the\nobservations, and the authors acknowledge the need for a\nlarger energy flux. The sample frequency for their electric\nfields appears from their figures to have been 2 s. Yet the\nvariability does not appear to be as large as for our 1-min\nA. L.

Our observations suggest that large vertical\nwinds may occur at intervals of high-temporal variation in\nJoule heating. This was not explored in the modelling study\nof Oyama et al. (2001). Our experiment appears to provide\nthe first evidence that meso-scale variability must be taken\ninto account when calculating Joule heating.\nThe Sodankyla\u00a8 thermospheric temperature response\nshown in figure 7a differed from the ion temperatures. This\nis as expected since the neutral particle number density is\n3 orders of magnitude larger, thus the thermosphere has a\nconsiderably larger heat capacity. There was no apparent re-\nsponse in Tn to the first heating event between 18:00\u201319:00\nUT. However, Tn rose steeply by 200 K between 19:20\u2013\n19:40 UT, fell sharply and rose again, reaching a maximum\nFig. 7.

The neutral temperature\nthen decreased, with several fluctuations, by around 250 K\nover 3.5 h. In general, higher values of Tn existed after\n19:30 UT which seem consistent with the period of enhanced\nJoule heating calculated using the 1-min average Joule heat-\ning values shown in Fig. 7b.\nA further comment is that Joule heating should be calcu-\nlated in the frame of reference of the neutral wind, which\nmeans that the effective electric field is E\u2032=V\u00d7B+U\u00d7B.\nFigure 7c shows the percentage difference made by the\nneutral wind dynamo in calculating the Joule heating\nterm. This percentage difference is calculated using\n(E\u20322perp\u2212E2perp)\/E\u20322perp and has both positive and negative\nvalues, i.e. the effect of the neutral wind dynamo was to\nboth enhance and reduce magnetospheric Joule heating. The\nstandard deviation of the percentage difference for the 1-\nmin averaged data ranges was 49% on this night (with sev-\neral outliers that are extremely large). The net effect for the\nnight of 27\u201328 February was an 8% increase in Joule heat-\ning. However, the size of the neutral wind dynamo contribu-\ntion can be appreciated by calculating the average magnitude\n|E\u20322perp\u2212E2perp)\/E\u20322perp| of the neutral wind dynamo contri-\nbution to total Joule heating on this night, which was 29%.\nThis is consistent with a model study by Thayer et al. (1995)\nthat has shown that ignoring the flywheel effect can intro-\nduce a 40% error in the calculation of height-integrated polar\ncap Joule heating during steady-state moderately active con-\nditions. Thus, ignoring the neutral wind dynamo means that\nthe redistribution of magnetospheric energy between Joule\nheating and acceleration of the thermosphere can be mistaken\nby several tens of percent. This is in addition to the effect\nof highly variable ion velocities compared with steady-state\nmodel conditions in increasing Joule heating and reducing\nthe net momentum transfer to the neutral winds.\nFigure 7d shows panel plots of the electron densities, Ne,\nfor all heights along the Troms\u00f8 beam, along with Te, Ti\n156 A.

IMAGE magnetometer traces showing the Bx component\non the night of 28 February\u20131 March 2003 at Sodankyla\u00a8.\nand V . Between 22:00\u201323:00 UT it was necessary to move\nthe Troms\u00f8 beam to a position 300 km above tristatic A,\nin order to improve the signal. This is shown in Fig. 7d\nas a shift in all the panel plots to a higher altitude range.\nThere were 4 periods of E-region particle precipitation that\ncan be observed in Fig. 7d from the enhancement of Ne\naround 100\u2013150 km altitude. The E-region particle precipita-\ntion was sporadic and occurred over periods between approx-\nimately 18:00\u201318:45 UT, 20:00\u201320:45 UT, 22:00\u201322:30 UT\nand 23:00\u201323:30 UT. The peaks in in-situ F-region Joule\nheating calculated using 1-min averages do not match the\nperiods of E-region particle precipitation. In fact, the peri-\nods of particle precipitation generally encompassed the low-\nest values of Joule heating. However, the Joule heating peaks\ndo match intensifications of the electron densities in the F-\nregion, i.e. in the periods 20:30\u201321:00 UT, 21:15\u201322:15 UT\nand 23:15\u201324:00 UT, as shown in Fig. 7d. These periods are\nindicated on Figs. 7a and b by grey panels, and on Fig. 7d by\narrows. These F-region intensifications may arise from low-\nenergy particle precipitation and also composition changes\naffecting production and loss of electrons, as well as equa-\ntorward transport of electrons from the polar cap.\n3.3 Tristatic neutral temperatures and anomalous ion tem-\nperatures\nThermospheric neutral temperatures are an important mea-\nsure of the energetics of the upper atmosphere. Given their\nimportance, it is necessary first of all to establish the re-\nliability of the temperature measurements from the FPIs.\nFigure 8a compares the derived neutral temperatures from\nthe three FPIs at tristatic position A on the second night\n(28 February until 1 March 2003). The Skibotn and So-\ndankyla\u00a8 temperatures were absolutely calibrated using a He-\nNe laser and ranged between 700\u20131400 K, with an average\nerror of \u00b150 K. These represent the first reported compar-\nisons of independently calibrated absolute temperature mea-\nsurements from a common thermospheric volume. The grey\nlines represent the Sodankyla\u00a8 data and the open diamonds\nrepresent the Skibotn data. The black lines represent the un-\ncalibrated KEOPS data, which have been offset by a constant\nvalue to match Sodankyla\u00a8 in order to compare trends.\nThe Skibotn temperatures have been filtered to exclude\ncloudy conditions identified from all-sky camera observa-\ntions, and have also had profiles removed that were af-\nfected by CCD saturation. The remaining periods around\n21:00\u201322:00 UT and during 02:00\u201303:00 UT on the night\nof 28 February\u20131 March 2003 demonstrate good agreement\nbetween the 3 sets of temperatures. The 630-nm intensities\nat the 3 sites showed a close match (Fig. 8b). This may be\ninterpreted as all 3 FPIs observing the same volume. The\ncomparison also revealed a large degree of temporal struc-\nture that appeared in all three sets of measurements. The\ntime resolution at KEOPS was over two times better than\nthat at Sodankyla\u00a8 and showed a great deal of small-scale\ntemporal variation. When viewed in conjunction with the\nSodankyla\u00a8 magnetometer data presented in Fig. 9 it is clear\nthat the large increases in temperature after 18:00 UT and\nagain after 22:00 UT coincided with large negative Bx de-\nflections and consequent electrojet activity. There was no\nevidence of a substantial time lag between the observation\nof the magnetometer deflections and the resultant increase in\nA. L.

If\nthe spatial variability of Tn was small, then even if there had\nbeen a rise in the emission height (which would mean that the\nFPIs were overshooting the common volume) the 3 separate\nmeasured values would still agree.\nFig. 11. Electron density tomographic images at 22:46 UT on 28\nFebruary 2003 showing that enhanced densities that were associ-\nated with the auroral activity extended to latitudes equatorward of\nSodankyla\u00a8. The arrow indicates the latitude of the tristatic A posi-\ntion.\nHowever, in fact, there were sizeable meridional temper-\nature differences over the field-of-view of 200\u2013400 K be-\ntween 16:00\u201321:00 UT on the night of 28 February\u20131 March\n2003. Figure 10a focuses on showing the neutral temper-\natures for the period 18:00\u201322:00 UT from the Sodankyla\u00a8\nNorth, Zenith, tristatic A and bistatic B observation points.\nThe North and A values of Tn were similar to each other,\nbut significantly different from the Zenith and B values. The\nvariation of the meridional temperature difference may be\nfurther investigated by comparing the temperatures observed\nto the north and south of Sodankyla\u00a8 for the period 18:50\u2013\n20:10 UT. This gives an overall average meridional temper-\nature difference of 270 K, with a maximum difference of\n466 K at 19:16 UT.\nFigure 10b shows the corresponding intensities and\nFig. 10c shows the average magnitude of the horizontal wind\ncomponent calculated from the 4 cardinal directions from the\nSodankyla\u00a8 FPI. It is clear that before 20:00 UT the auroral ac-\ntivity was to the north of Sodankyla\u00a8, resulting in the larger in-\ntensities seen in the North and A positions. The large merid-\nional gradient in temperature would appear to have been a\nconsequence of auroral heating to the north. From 22:30 UT\nonwards, the auroral activity moved overhead, and the in-\ntensities and temperatures became more uniform. The to-\nmography plot of electron density at 22:46 UT (Fig. 11) con-\nfirms this by showing that enhanced densities associated with\nthe auroral activity extended to latitudes equatorward of So-\ndankyla\u00a8.\nIt is also possible that the sharp increase and decrease in\nthe temperature gradient may have been the consequence of\na rise in the 630-nm emission height. If it is assumed that\nthe temperature gradient remained constant but that the emis-\nsion height had risen, then the emitting volumes seen by the\nFPI to the north and south of Sodankyla\u00a8 would have been\nfurther apart, which could account for the increase in tem-\n158 A. L. Aruliah et al.: First direct evidence of meso-scale variability on ion-neutral dynamics\nperature gradient. However, the emission height would need\nto rise by 70% to produce such a large increase in the tem-\nperature gradient. This is too large a rise to be plausible over\na horizontal scale of several hundred kilometres, since the\nenergy required to lift the atmosphere would be very great.\nAnother argument against a rise in the emission altitude is\nthat the North and tristatic A intensities and temperatures re-\nmained close in values throughout this period. A rise in alti-\ntude would have meant that their respective sampled volumes\nwould have consequently spread apart and the values would\nhave become different.\nFigure 10c shows that before 22:00 UT the magnitudes\nof the horizontal wind were high and ranged between\n200\u2013300 m\/s. In particular, between 18:45\u20131930 UT the\nmagnitudes were nearly 300 m\/s. The large size of these\nwinds probably corroborates the existence of a large tem-\nperature gradient and consequently large pressure gradient\ndriving these winds.\nThe absolute calibration of the Sodankyla\u00a8 temperatures al-\nlows a further important observation to be made. Going back\nto the first night of observations on the night of 27\u201328 Febru-\nary 2003, a comparison of Tn from the Sodankyla\u00a8 FPI with\nTi calculated from the EISCAT data for a height of 245 km\n(Fig. 7a) showed an anomaly in Ti \u2013 there was an extended\nperiod between 19:50\u201322:40 UT when Ti<Tn. The reliabil-\nity of the measurement of Tn comes from the comparison\nwith the independent measurements of Tn from the other two\nFPIs. Therefore, these values of Ti are unlikely to be correct\nsince the ionosphere is less than 0.1% of the composition of\nthe upper atmosphere, and consequently, through ion-neutral\ncollisions, the ion temperatures must be at least as high as the\nneutral temperature. One possible error in the computation\nof Ti arises from the assumption of a composition that is to-\ntally atomic oxygen and the other is that the radar spectra are\nnon-Maxwellian and consequently not fitted appropriately.\nThe evidence for changing the composition is ambiguous.\nThe period between 21:20\u201322:20 UT corresponded to a large\nupwelling in the neutral winds, as shown in Fig. 2b, which\nmay have increased the proportion of molecular species at\nthis height. However, the period between 20:00\u201320:40 UT\ncorresponded to downwelling in the neutral winds, which\nwould be unlikely to change the mean molecular mass and\ntherefore does not provide enough support for the composi-\ntion theory.\nThe suggestion that Ti is incorrectly calculated is sup-\nported by Fig. 7d. Whenever there was precipitation in the F-\nregion (around 400 km) the electron temperature Te dropped\nby a few hundred Kelvin. This is clearly evident in the\n2 periods centred on 19:16 UT and 19:37 UT and the pe-\nriods: 20:27\u201320:48 UT, 21:35\u201321:53 UT, 22:00\u201322:19 UT\nand 23:50\u201324:00 UT. Despite the increased electron densi-\nties caused by precipitation, which would have increased the\nconductivity and hence Joule heating, Te should have re-\nmained fairly constant since electron heating is very small\nand is primarily due to plasma wave activity (e.g. Schlegel\nand St.-Maurice, 1981). The implication is that the standard\nprocedure for determining Te is incorrect, and thus Ti will\nFig. 12. Variation of hmF2 on the nights of (a) 27\u201328 February 2003\nand (b) 28 February\u20131 March 2003 from EISCAT and tomography\ndata. It is assumed that the 630-nm peak emission height is 240 km\n(dot-dashed line). This assumption is compared with an assumption\nthat the peak height is about 50 km below hmF2 (dotted line).\nbe wrongly calculated too since Ti \/Te is the parameter de-\ntermined from the radar spectra. Anomalous decreases in Te\nhave been proposed as a flag indicating incorrect assump-\ntions of composition or the presence of non-Maxwellian\nradar spectra by McCrea et al. (1995).\nIf the Ti values were correctly calculated, then a possi-\nble cause for the anomalous Ti\u2013Tn comparison arises from\nthe height variation of the red line peak emission altitude.\nFigure 7a also shows the EISCAT Ti at 294 km altitude.\nComparison of Ti at 245 km and 294 km shows that before\n20:00 UT there was only a small difference in Ti (<100 K)\nwith respect to height, so determination of the altitude of the\ncommon volume is not critical. After 20:00 UT there was a\nlarge difference, up to a maximum of 400 K, which means\nthe altitude used for comparison of Tn and Ti becomes very\nsensitive. At 294 km there were no longer anomalous peri-\nods when Ti<Tn which may imply that this altitude provides\na more likely common volume. The tristatic experiment as-\nsumes a common volume at an altitude of 240 km. However,\nFig. 12a shows that between 20:00\u201320:40 UT hmF2 rose to\nan altitude of around 350 km, and between 21:20\u201322:00 UT\nA. L. Aruliah et al.: First direct evidence of meso-scale variability on ion-neutral dynamics 159\nthe altitude was around 375 km. Thus, an altitude of 300 km\nmay be acceptable as the altitude of the 630-nm emission\npeak if it is assumed that the peak is one scale height be-\nlow the hmF2 peak, although this is considerably higher than\nexpected.\nIf the Ti values are correct, then an explanation is required\nfor the large difference in Ti measured at altitudes 245 km\nand 294 km that appeared after 20:00 UT. This time corre-\nsponded to a switch in the line-of-sight ion velocities from\nblue shifted (NWW direction) to red shifted (SEE direction),\nas shown in Fig. 7d. This may indicate that the heat energy\nwas being transported up the field lines so that the F-region\nremained hot while the lower altitudes cooled. However, this\nexplanation does not address the extremely low temperatures\nat 245 km after 20:00 UT, which reached as low as 800 K.\nThe radar data from 245 km and 294 km represents a hori-\nzontal as well as vertical spatial difference since the elevation\nangle of the Troms\u00f8 beam is 45\u25e6. This means that compar-\nison may be made with FPI measurements from other view-\ning directions, in particular a comparison of the KEOPS FPI\nTn to the north of KEOPS with the KEOPS Tn at position\nA. The difference between the two temperatures is an indi-\ncation of the thermospheric temperature gradient along the\nTroms\u00f8 beam (see Fig. 1) and will define the minimum pos-\nsible value of Ti along the beam. Figure 7e shows that the\ntemperature difference was rarely more than \u00b1200 K. Dur-\ning the period 20:00\u201324:00 UT, not only was the Tn differ-\nence much smaller than the Ti difference, but it was in the\nwrong direction, since Tn to the north of KEOPS was on av-\nerage hotter. This casts further doubt on the reliability of the\nvalues of Ti at 245 km.\nResolving the cause of these anomalies is our next venture;\nit is either the influence of increased molecular ion compo-\nsition or non-Maxwellian spectra in the EISCAT data; deter-\nmining or what altitude should be used for the comparison of\nTi and Tn is also increasing. Furthermore, tristatic common\nvolume experiments are the most likely way to achieve this.\n3.4 Variation of the 630-nm peak emission altitude\nThe EISCAT volume of observation is known since it is\nan active radar, but passive airglow observation depends on\nthe 630-nm peak emission height, which is assumed to be\n240 km (e.g. Solomon et al., 1988). However, if the 630-nm\nemission height is different, then the FPIs over\/undershoot\nthe tristatic volume. It should be possible to estimate the\nheight of the 630 nm emission from the EISCAT measure-\nment of hmF2, since it is assumed to be approximately 1\nscale height (40\u201350 km) below hmF2 (e.g. Makela et al.,\n2001). Figure 12 shows that there was considerable devi-\nation from this assumption by plotting hmF2 for the two\ncampaign nights, 27\u201328 February 2003 and 28 February\u20131\nMarch 2003. The values of hmF2 are greater than 300 km for\nmost of both nights, which implies that the FPIs were over-\nshooting the common volume for significant periods.\nThe height of the F2 peak obtained by radio tomography at\na latitude of 70\u25e6 N is shown by the asterisks in Fig. 12. The\ntomography heights are in broad agreement with the trend\nseen in the hmF2 measured by the EISCAT radar, though\nwith a lower peak height occurring between about 02:00 and\n04:00 UT. Whilst there is clear agreement in the trend, the\nabsolute values of the peak altitudes inferred from the tomo-\ngraphic images should be treated with some caution due to\nthe incomplete observing ray-path geometry for the experi-\nmental technique. The lack of quasi-horizontal ray-paths re-\nsults in limited information of the vertical ionospheric distri-\nbution being available for the reconstruction process (Pryse,\n2003).\nDespite the likely variation in the 630-nm peak height\nthroughout the night, the independently measured intensi-\nties from the 3 FPIs matched very well on the 2 campaign\nnights of 27\u201328 February and 28 February\u20131 March 2003\n(Figs. 13b and c). In contrast, the night of 26\u201327 Febru-\nary (Fig. 13a) showed the effect of light scatter by clouds\nover Sodankyla\u00a8 and Skibotn through the night. Cloud scat-\nter raises the whole background level, thus reducing the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and also the directional information is\nlost, resulting in a poor match in intensities. However, by\n03:00 UT the cloud had cleared and so the Sodankyla\u00a8 in-\ntensities rose to match the KEOPS intensities. The Skibotn\nintensities matched KEOPS well from the beginning of the\nnight through to about 21:45 UT, after which the sky became\novercast and the intensities dropped.\nThe assumption of a peak 630-nm emission altitude of\n240 km can be further tested by taking advantage of the\ntristatic geometry and complementary instrumentation in the\nregion. In Fig. 14 we present a comparison of the 630-\nnm intensity for a 2-h period from 21:30 UT to 23:30 UT\non 27\u201328 February 2003 as measured by the Sodankyla\u00a8 and\nKEOPS FPIs, together with a Meridian Scanning Photome-\nter (MSP) co-located with the Sodankyla\u00a8 FPI. The intensities\nhave been arbitrarily scaled to allow for a comparison of the\nmajor features. The MSP was oriented azimuthally towards\nthe tristatic volume for the duration of the tristatic experi-\nment and scanned from elevations of 20\u25e6\u201375\u25e6. The figure\nshows the MSP intensities at 45\u25e6 elevation, which was the\nsame as the elevation angle of the Sodankyla\u00a8 FPI. These in-\ntensities are compared to both the KEOPS tristatic and the\nSodankyla\u00a8 North intensities. The reason for the comparison\nwith Sodankyla\u00a8 North intensities is that if the peak emission\naltitude had been 300 km, rather than 240 km, then the vol-\nume observed by KEOPS would have been much closer to\nSodankyla\u00a8 North than to the Sodankyla\u00a8 tristatic position (see\nFig. 1 for geometry). Figure 14 shows a close agreement\nbetween the KEOPS FPI tristatic A observation and the So-\ndankyla\u00a8 MSP measurements which consequently gives con-\nfidence that the peak emission altitude was closer to 240 km\nthan 300 km.\nUnfortunately, this contradicts the suggestion that the\nproblem of the anomalous ion temperatures period (when\nTi<Tn around 240 km altitude) may be solved by presuming\nthat the FPI was sampling a volume around 300 km altitude.\n160 A.

Investigation of the 630-nm emission height by compari-\nson of features seen by the Sodankyla\u00a8 MSP with the KEOPS and\nSodankyla\u00a8 FPIs on the night of 27\u201328 February 2003.\n4 Preliminary conclusions\nThis tristatic FPI-EISCAT radar experiment presents evi-\ndence of the rapid response of the thermosphere to ion drag\non the meso-scale. High temporal variability in thermo-\nspheric temperatures and winds are demonstrated, which\nvaried significantly over time scales of a few minutes and\nover distances of a few hundred kilometres. As a result, the\nprevailing view of the inertial thermosphere can no longer be\njustified on the meso-scale, except as the coarsest of assump-\ntions, and certainly not in storm situations.\nThe tristatic FPI measurements present the first ever com-\nparison of absolute temperatures from independently cali-\nbrated FPIs. True thermospheric temperatures are vitally im-\nportant as a measure of the energetics of the upper atmo-\nsphere. The FPIs provided direct measurements of Tn rather\nthan derived values from radar measurements which rely on\nassumptions from models. The 3 different line-of-sight mea-\nsurements showed a good agreement which confirms the re-\nliability of the experimental method in determining absolute\ntemperatures.\nThe most significant finding is that the neutral and ion tem-\nperature response appears to have a better match with Joule\nheating calculated from the highly variable 1-min plasma ve-\nlocities rather than 15-min averages for the night of 27\u201328\nFebruary 2003. There was a 320% increase in the Joule heat-\ning when using the 1-min average ion velocities compared\nwith the 15-min averages, owing to the stochastic motion of\nthe ions which increases friction between the ions and neu-\ntrals. This is the first direct evidence of the effect of small-\nscale variability on Joule heating. It is important because the\ncurrent GCMs ignore small-scale variability, and thus under-\nestimate Joule heating, by using smoothed high-latitude av-\nerage electric field models. This would account for the low\nmodel temperatures which can be hundreds of Kelvin lower\nthan observed directly by FPIs and the low model vertical\nwinds (<20 m\/s) which are several times smaller than ob-\nserved. It has taken many years for the observations of large\nvertical winds (>50 m\/s) to be taken seriously.\nThe interpretation of the Joule heating-temperature rela-\ntionship is complicated by an extended period of anomalous\nion temperatures when Ti<Tn. However, we propose that\nthe anomaly indicates flaws in the assumptions used in de-\nriving Ti , possibly due to the existence of non-Maxwellian\nspectra, incorrect assumptions of the molecular ion compo-\nsition or misidentification of the height of the common vol-\nume. The height is not thought to be the problem because\ncomparison between auroral features observed in FPI inten-\nsities and meridian scanning photometers seem to indicate\nthat the 630-nm emission height does not stray too far from\n240 km.\nFurther support for the inclusion of the variability of the\nplasma velocities in GCMs is that it should also reduce the\nnet momentum transferred from the ions to the neutrals, re-\nsulting in smaller neutral winds. This would improve agree-\nment with the wind speeds measured by FPIs. Model winds\nat high latitudes can be up to twice as large as observed\nwinds. However, the discrepancy between observations and\nmodels in allocating magnetospheric energy between Joule\nheating and acceleration of the neutral gas is too complex to\nbe resolved by a simple transfer of energy from one form to\nthe other. For example, as a rough order of magnitude cal-\nculation, the difference in kinetic energy between a model\nA. L. Aruliah et al.: First direct evidence of meso-scale variability on ion-neutral dynamics 161\nwind of 300 m\/s and FPI wind of 200 m\/s corresponds to a\ntemperature difference of only 30\u201340 K, which is not enough\nto account for the model neutral temperatures being a few\nhundred Kelvin lower than the FPI temperatures. The reduc-\ntion in the model winds needs to be brought about by allow-\ning for a random stochastic acceleration of the neutrals rather\nthan a steady acceleration. This can probably be achieved by\nparameterization in a similar manner to that used for Joule\nheating by Codrescu et al. (2000).\nThe F-region neutral wind dynamo has been shown to be\naround half the magnitude of the 15-min average magneto-\nspheric dynamo. This also significantly modifies the redistri-\nbution of magnetospheric energy between Joule heating and\nacceleration of the thermospheric gas. The study of small-\nscale ion-neutral interactions is proving to be extremely com-\nplex.\nAppendix A\nTheoretically, the derivation of a tristatic wind vector may be\nachieved by setting up and solving the simultaneous equa-\ntions for the 3 line-of-sight measurements in the following\nmanner:\nLet the neutral wind vector be U=Ux i+Uyj + Uzk.\nAnd the direction vector for the line-of-sight observation\nbe r= sin \u03b8 cos\u03c6i+ sin \u03b8 sin\u03c6j+ cos \u03b8k, where i, j and k are\northogonal axes with positive directions being geographic\nnorth, geographic east and vertically down, respectively. The\nangles \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the standard spherical coordinate system\ndefinitions, i.e. \u03b8 is measured from the k axis and \u03c6 lies in\nthe i, j plane and is measured from the i axis.\nThus the line-of-sight component winds Ulos from each\nsite may be determined from the following equations:\nUglos = U .rg for KEOPS\nUf los = U .rf for Sodankyla\u00a8\nUmlos = U .rm for Skibotn .\nThese 3 equations may be given in matrix form as\nUlos=R.U. Thus, U=R\u22121 Ulos.\nThe success of this calculation requires good geometry\nand the assumption that all three line-of-sight wind measure-\nments come from the same volume. The optimal geometry is\nthat the 3 sites and the observed volume form an equilateral\npyramid. The observation of a common volume depends on\nthe actual height of the 630-nm emission peak, which for this\nexperiment was expected to be 240 km.\nAcknowledgements.
