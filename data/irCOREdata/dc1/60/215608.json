Two new books \ninvestigate these opportunities as well as their philosophical implications.  In Global Technography:  \nEthnography in the Age of Mobility Grant Kien, an assistant professor in the Department of \nCommunication Studies at California State University, East Bay and a former student of Norman \nDenzin, proposes a new methodology to investigate wireless mobility.  This methodology extends the \nethnographic field to encompass the experience of mobility, using actor-network theory and employing \nHeideggerian phenomenology to express how technology plays a role in expanding this field.  In \nOnline Interviewing Nalita James and Hugh Busher of the University of Leicester propose a practical \nguide to conducting online qualitative research that also reflects on the philosophical implications of \nshifting research practices into increasingly mediated contexts.  Drawing on a long collaboration that \nincluded studies of young researchers' entry into academia, the book introduces core practices for social \nresearchers working online, accompanied by illustrations and reflections from the authors' own \nexperiences. \n \nTaken together, the books highlight the continuing distinction between methodology and method, where \nthe former stresses the theoretical and philosophical principles underlying a method, and the latter the \napplication of those principles.  While each work proposes means of understanding mediated social \nlife, Kien's work is more clearly methodology, concentrated on developing a system of thought useful \nfor understanding mediated mobility whereas James and Busher's concentrates on method,  outlining \nthe ethical and philosophical aspects of various online interview techniques while also providing a \nguide to their application.  Both works contribute to philosophical reflections on the nature of social \nrelations as they are mediated by contemporary technologies.  They differ in their epistemological \nclaims, with Kien taking a more radical position about the transformation of knowledge occurring in \nand through technologically mediated relationship.   \n \nTechnography: A Radical New Methodology \n \nGlobal Technography promises to outline and test a new methodology for understanding human \nexperience in a highly mediated context.  To do this, it intersperses the development of his \nphilosophical argument with auto-ethnographic reflection, alternating several paragraphs of theoretical \nframing with vignettes of the same length.  These passages recount episodes of Kien's life in which \nmobile or networked technology plays a role.  They are set in Seoul, Rome, Toronto, Champaign-\nUrbana, Chiapas and Beijing, and from them a picture emerges of a proud Canadian expat in continual \nreflection about technology in his everyday life.  The vignettes are carefully written such that laptops \nand cell phones are main characters, along with graduate student Kien and his friends and colleagues.  \nThey are clearly intended not only to accompany the theoretical development of technography as a \nglobal-scaled ethnographic methodology but to act as examples of how this methodology might be \nconceived and developed.  Eight chapters use this alternating structure to describe the methodology and \nthen to explore power as exercised in \u201cglobal\u201d situations as well as the relationships between culture, \ntechnology and ontology.  The middle section of the book is concerned with ontology and \u201cbelonging,\u201d \nin the context of global culture and post-global citizenship \u2013 in this section, even the auto-ethnographic \nvignettes are imbued with a sense of philosophical urgency as Kien, ill in bed, struggles to come to \nterms with Heidegger while his computer is in the shop.  The final chapters explore \u201chome\u201d and \u201clove\u201d \n- again through the relationship between Kien and the technology in his life.  An appendix rehearses the \ncontribution of the methodology to concepts of Heideggerian freedom.  Finally, a glossary of actor-\nnetwork theory terms \u2013 not all of which are actually used in the book - rounds out the slim volume.   \n \nThe aims of the book are grand and the reliance on auto-ethnography is a brave move.  Kien explains at \nseveral points how his own experience as \u201cvagabond\u201d or \u201ctourist\u201d  supported by mobile technology has \nmotivated this form of exploration:  \u201cAlthough I have \u201ctaken up residence\u201d (Carey, 1989) in many \ndifferent locations, it is only in the stabilization of certain daily rituals with the help of mobile devices \nthat I have begun to feel that my sense of identity is better able to withstand such radical uprooting\u201d (p. \n119).  At times the auto-ethnographic approach is compelling:  the narrative of Kien's fevered \nreflection on and final understanding of Heidegger's paradoxical notion of freedom through knowledge \nof enframing is compelling, and his discussion of this epiphany (which amounts to:  live every moment \nas if it mattered) with his yoga teacher over a bowl of noodles in a Toronto cafe is charming.  At other \ntimes, it seems Kien's grand \u2013 even global \u2013 intentions aren't matched by his execution.  The snippets \nof conceptual development (with the exception of the discussion of enframing and enlightenment) are \noften too short to be coherent, with different conceptual perspectives explored in each one.  The result \nthrough much of the book, is similar to reading a literature review in alternation with a travelogue. \n \nValidity of \u201cTechnography\u201d \nA reading of auto-ethnography as travelogue is a conventional critique of the approach, as is the related \ncritique that Kien's mobile, connected life of graduate study in the United States, English instruction in \nKorea and volunteer work with the Zapatistas in Mexico is too privileged and unusual to provide \nenough insight into \u201ctechnography\u201d as a means of understanding culture, mobility and technology.  To \na certain extent these critiques are valid:  despite reflexivity about his own Canadian-ness, Kien travels \nwith both the privilege and the practices that his comfortable mobility provides.  His national identity, \nsolidified by watching Canadian television and reading Canadian newspapers online is a protective \ncocoon from which he observes \u201cother technological practices.\u201d  It is tempting to respond to Kien's \nvignettes with my own:  we were graduate school colleagues and my own professional career has \ninvolved a similar level of mobility, connectivity and mediation in similarly exotic and privileged \nglobal spaces.  I too feel some security when my mobile phone has a signal, or in the morning's ritual \nof e-mail and online news.  And I too feel that travel offers the opportunity for a transcendental look at \nthe mundane beauties of everyday life.  In the best travel writing philosophy can be close to the surface \nas the reflexive traveller finds out more about himself the further away he tries to get.  Yet the \ncombination of these elements through self-reflexivity is not convincing as a methodology.  Too much \ndepends on the assumption that such mobility and connectivity creates a fundamental discontinuity in \nculture and experience.  Rhetorically, and methodologically, does it matter that I typed these words \nwhile on the inter-city bus between Oxford and London?   \n \nKien's personal and methodological journey is provocative, but there is little in it of others' voices.  The \nHeideggerian revelations are individual; and the search for wireless connectivity (which illustrates the \nrole of technology in configuring mobility) a picture of the \u201cnetworked individual\u201d (Wellman, 2001).  \nCertainly, many voices appear in in the conceptual sections, but aside from Heidegger, Kien is hardly \nin conversation with them.  Furthermore, there is little sense of what kinds of collective social \nmobilizations a global mobility might promise, despite several vignettes from a stint of volunteer work \nin Chiapas.  This individual focus overlooks the extent to which mobile individuals are also part of \npublics as Sheller (2004) points out.  These may be more contingent and fluid than the Canadian \nnationalism that Kien describes as his anchor.  For example, Kien visits Montreal and experiences a \nsense of disconnection and loneliness, illustrated by his inability to locate a wireless hotspot that would \npermit him to enact his customary media habits, and by his difficulty in speaking French.  Considering \nthat a volunteer, collaborative project created Wi-Fi access points across Montreal (see Powell, 2008) \nKien's isolation is unfortunate \u2013 but perhaps connected to the fact that the community Wi-Fi project  \ninitially developed in French-speaking parts of the city.  In focusing on the mediating functions of both \nmedia technologies and individual identity, the complexity of collective engagement promised by \nprojects like community wireless is obscured.  These projects can be much less about getting online \nand much more about expressing a shared identity and improving a local place.  The unmoored, \nindividual global \u201ctechnographer\u201d may be blinded to such complexity.  Merely being mobile and \nnetworked does not imply that one's connections are unmoored from places and the multiple, complex \nidentities they can solicit.  Even in an age of mobile connectivity, we can and do belong in places, and \nuse our technologies to express that belonging.   \n \nOnline Interviewing: Social continuity \n \nJames and Busher also acknowledge how networked technologies shift experiences of time and space, \nand the way that they can reorder individual and collective experience.  In comparison to Kien they are \nmore interested in assessing how online methods are in continuity with other social research methods \u2013 \nand by extension, how social relations are also in continuity.  In Online Interviewing nine chapters \nexplore how the affordances of online interactions create specific challenges for social researchers.  \nThroughout, boxes summarize the features of online communication and online research design that are \nmost important for researchers to understand, and vignettes present research project excerpts and \ndescriptions.  The chapters close with \u201cpractical tips for researchers.\u201d  Although the authors note in the \nintroduction that the work is not intended as a \u201chow-to\u201d book, its structure and content liken it to a \nmanual. The first chapter discusses how knowledge is constructed within qualitative research, and in \nparticular how it is constructed \u201cin this disembodied, anonymous and textual environment, and how \nthat environment affects research relationships when the visual and verbal clues present in face-to-face \nconversations are absent\u201d (p. 17).  A detailed chart compares factors impacting the construction of \nknowledge through online versus face to face interviews.  Various pragmatic considerations including \ncost, access, nature and speed of response, as well as quality of data are examined.  The second and \nthird chapters focus on the philosophical aspects of practical research choices like engaging with \nresearch participants online and developing research strategies.  Particular emphasis is placed on \nengaging with 'virtual communities' and navigating the ethical consequences of choices including \nparticipation in these communities.   \n \nLike Kien, James and Busher analyze the influence of socio-technical transformations for gathering and \ngenerating information about people's experiences within their social worlds.  They describe how the \nonline, networked social space facilitates the creation of communities of practice and allows \nresearchers to explore \u201cco-temporal and co-spatial relationships as well as relationships between people \nin different times and places\u201d (p. 105).  In particular, Chapter 4 discusses the impact of shifts in space \nand time on conducting ethnographies and interviews \u2013 especially by e-mail.  The authors discuss the \nimpact of the absence of the social signals that are an expected part of interviewing face to face, even \nnoting that these absences may mean that researchers can't be sure if an e-mailed interview response is \nwritten by the interviewee:  \u201cthe absence of visible clues makes it difficult to know who is talking in an \nonline conversation\u201d (p. 53).   In this section, James and Busher echo Zhao in arguing that online \ncommunication has allowed for a construction of a \u201cthen and now\u201d that parallels the \u201chere and now.\u201d   \n \nThe second half of the book shifts the focus from research design to issues of ethics, power, and \nrepresentation.  Chapter 5 investigates the affordances of online public and private spaces for \nresearchers as well as research participants.  The affordances of these spaces \u2013 web forums, chat rooms, \nor virtual learning environments - create unique ethical dilemmas for researchers, but also protect \nresearch participants by allowing them more agency in reflecting on and constructing their responses.  \nChapters Six and Seven discuss credibility, authenticity, power and influence while Chapter Eight \nconcentrates on the nature of online communities.    \n \nEthics, Power and Representation \nThe strength of the book lies in its combination of practical advice about conducting research and its \nphilosophical discussion of the constraints and possibilities of conducting research online.  The \nbibliography ranges across classic social research references and the state of the art in internet social \nresearch.  James and Busher are sensitive to the cultures of research as well as to the cultures of \nparticipants in online interviews or ethnographies.  However, there is a distinct textual bias in this \nwork:  the authors pay great attention to the possibilities for interaction in MUDs, chat rooms, and \nvirtual learning environments, but primarily in terms of the textual.  They describe online language as \n\u201ca hybrid of both spoken and written language\u201d (p. 107) and note that it is \u201cclose to talk\u201d while \nobviously still being text.  The authors' concern about the contours of power relations online is also \nexpressed in terms of language and to a lesser extent, text: \u201cpeople's ability to use language skilfully is \nan essential element in their power to engage in online discussions . . . moreover, online \ncommunication in research is predominantly carried out in English at present . . . such circumstances \nmay lead to participants withdrawing from research projects or reverting to text discussions in their \nnative language\u201d (89).  This focus on text could result from the longer history of text-based versus \nmulti-media interactions online, or from the authors' interest in investigating the social relations of \ngroups of people including  the educators and doctoral students that the authors worked with in their \nown research projects.   \n \nThe multi-media nature of much contemporary online life may mean that this textual bias becomes less \nimportant.  As James and Busher acknowledge in the conclusion to their volume, cheaper and more \nreadily available web cameras along with VOIP services such as Skype may make online interviewing \nmore similar to telephone or even face-to-face interviewing, although bandwidth constraints may still \nmean that these interviews have an asynchronous quality.  More profoundly, anonymous video \nexperiments like ChatRoulette sever the link between temporal, visual presence and de-anonymization.  \nAs mediated social interactions are increasingly experienced synchronously (within the constraints of \ntime zones and waking hours) the features that Online Interviewing analyze as part of online social \nexperience may shift.  So too may the expectation that online interviewing be textual:  As Crabtree and \nRodden (2008) point out, online or mediated research can now include naturalistic observation, voice \ninterviews, chat log data or even location-based data gathered from mobile devices. \n \nThe textual bias may also reflect the fact that many qualitative researchers analyze their research results \nas texts, transcribing interviews and archiving field notes.  Given the many different aspects and \ndetailed contours of mediated, networked life, the linear text may not best represent contemporary \nsocial experience.  The main weakness of this book is that it does not consider how networked \nmediation might provide other opportunities for expression, interaction and social transformation \nbesides exchanges of text. \n \nContinuity and Discontinuity \n \nIn their different approaches to conducting research and in the importance they accord to the the \nrelationship between technology and social relationships, these works align on two sides of a \nlongstanding debate about whether contemporary life, with its increasing mediation through ubiquitous \nnetworks of communication, is fundamentally in continuity or discontinuity with the social life of the \npast.  As Boczkowski and Lievrouw (2008) discuss, theorizations of new media tend to align on a \nspectrum from continuity to discontinuity.  Arguments for continuity tend to focus on the ways that \nnetworked communication facilitates or reinforces aspects of social life, whereas discontinuity \nperspectives enumerate the ways in which the particular type, level and intensity of mediation \ndistinguish contemporary experience from that which has come before.  The continuity perspective has \nbecome predominant since the 1990s, accompanied by a critique of the \u201ctranscendence\u201d often promised \nby new technologies.  More recently, studies at the intersection of science and technology studies and \ncommunication studies \u201chave adopted a view of social change that encompasses both the continuous \nand the discontinuous, the evolutionary and the revolutionary qualities and characteristics of media and \ninformation technologies and their effects\u201d (p. 965).   \n \nOnline Interviewing and Global Technography both exhibit this balanced perspective, in the main .   \nHowever, they take different stances on the nature of social inquiry in contexts of mediated \ncommunication.  While the authors of Online Interviewing concentrate on the issues and practices that \nare specifically related to interviewing online as opposed to face-to face, they see the social space \nestablished online as being in continuity with other such spaces, albeit with its own particular ethical \ncontours.  \u201cThe online\u201d is thus a platform upon which aspects of life take place, and notwithstanding \nethical challenges, the process of knowledge construction remains essentially the same.  In contrast, \nGlobal Technography proceeds from the assumption that human social relations are but one part of a \nnetwork in which technology is itself an actor: \u201cglobal technography helps us show that technology is a \ndramatic and dynamic participant in the practice of everyday life.\u201d  Kien thus proposes that a new \n\u201ctechnography\u201d is essential in demonstrating the nature of the resulting transformation.  This \nparticipation and the network of relations that it restructures society \u2013 thus the need for a new \nmethodology.  The bounded \u201cethnographic field\u201d is not representative of the global-scaled, mobile \nlives that are now part of everyday experience for many.  By acknowledging how much this global, \nmobile experience is part of banal experience, Kien does acknowledge the continuity of human \nexperience, but his insistence on the necessity for a new methodology suggests that he views \ncontemporary social relations, and indeed the human experience of relating and belonging to groups or \nnations, as fundamentally influenced by technological mediation.  This perspective offers possibilities, \nbut taken to its logical extreme, implies a shrinking field for human agency and collective engagement. \n \nThe challenge posed by the increasing mediation of everyday life is what makes both of these books \nimportant.  The affordances of online or networked spaces are shifting, and it is the task of researchers \nto do our best at describing them.  Whether one accepts the radical proposal that a new methodology \nsuch as technography is needed or considers that existing methods should be applied to online social \nspaces, the fact remains that social research is about understanding the contexts and contours of social \nlife.  To the extent that these books provide tools and ways of thinking about how to meet these \nchallenges, they both contribute to advancing contemporary social research. \n \n \n \n \nBibliography \n \nBoczkowski, P., & Lievrouw, L.
