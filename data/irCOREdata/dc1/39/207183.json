In contrast, Fajnzylber, Lederman & Loayza (1998; 2002a, b) provide seemingly \nstrong and robust evidence that inequality causes a higher rate of both homicide and \nrobbery\/violent theft even after controlling for country-specific fixed effects. Our results \nsuggest that inequality is not a statistically significant determinant, unless either country-\nspecific effects are not controlled for or the sample is artificially restricted to a small number of \ncountries. The reason why the link between inequality and violent property crime might be \nspurious is that income inequality is likely to be strongly correlated with country-specific fixed \neffects such as cultural differences. A high degree of inequality might be socially undesirable \nfor any number of reasons, but that it causes violent crime is far from proven. \n \nIntroduction \nIn an analysis of the determinants of homicide rates in a cross-national panel, the present \nauthor has already argued that the apparent link between income inequality and homicide \nmight be spurious (Neumayer, 2003). It is the objective of this short research note to \ncomplement this earlier argument in looking at robbery and violent theft. It demonstrates that \nincome inequality is positively associated with robbery\/violent theft only if either country-\nspecific fixed effects are not controlled for or the sample is artificially restricted to a small \nnumber of countries. \nMany economists have long since argued that income inequality is likely to be a cause of \nviolent crime, particularly violent property crime. This is because greater inequality means a \nhigher concentration of economic wealth in the hands of a few, which implies easier targets to \npotential criminals and raises the net gains of engaging in violent property crime (Fleisher, \n3 \n1966; Ehrlich, 1973; Chiu & Madden, 1998; Kelly, 2000; Soares, 2002; for a dissenting view \nsee Deutsch, Spiegel & Templeman 1992). From a different angle, deprivation theory, popular \namong many criminologists and sociologists, similarly regards economic inequality as a major \nsource of violent crime (Hagan & Peterson, 1995). The relative deprivation of the poor is seen \nto cause frustration and anger that unloads itself in violent crime. \nAnd yet, \u2018the evidence in favour of that hypothesis is weak\u2019 (Bourguignon, Nu\u00f1ez & \nSanchez 2003: abstract). Evidence from time-series analysis of the aggregate crime rate in the \nUS is rather inconclusive (Allen, 1996). Cross-sectional regressions across metropolitan areas \nor states within the US as well as sometimes across nations often show a positive effect of \ninequality on violent crime, but not always (see Neapolitan (1997) and the many references \ncited therein). A major setback of simple cross-sectional analysis is that it cannot control for \nfixed effects. Freeman (1996) refers to an unpublished study in which the link between \ninequality and crime disappeared once fixed effects were controlled for. This is not surprising \nif, as Bourguignon (2001: 26) argues, unobserved factors are likely to simultaneously affect \nincome inequality and crime. Given enormous variation in the rate of crime across space \ntogether with the fact that measurable characteristics can account for little of this variation, as \nGlaeser, Sacerdote & Scheinkman (1996) argue, income inequality might merely pick up the \neffect of unobservable factors such as cultural and other differences if fixed effects are not \ncontrolled for. \nIn the face of this weak evidence, Fajnzylber, Lederman & Loayza (FLL thereafter) \n(1998; 2002a, b) seemingly demonstrate an effect of income inequality on violent crime that is \nrobust to controlling for country-specific fixed effects. The evidence provided by FLL thus \nseems much stronger and more robust than previous evidence. Di Tella, Galiani and \nSchargrodsky (2002, p. 4), for example, state with reference to FLL (2002a) that \u2018the main \nconclusion of the paper is that income inequality, measured by the Gini index, has a robust, \n4 \nsignificant and positive effect on the incidence of violent crimes\u2019. Since publication, dozens of \nother authors have cited FLL\u2019s finding of a strong link between inequality and violent crime \u2013 \nsee, for example, Buvini\u0107 & Morrison (2000), Gartner (2000), World Health Organization \n(2002), Alvarez (2002), Prillaman (2003), Saridakis (2003) and Glaeser, Scheinkman & \nShleifer (2003). The World Bank\u2019s official World Development Report (2003: 155) refers to \nFLL (1998) when it claims that \u2018factors such as high levels of inequality continue to fuel \nhomicides\u2019. Professor Jan van Dijk (2003), the Chief of the Crime Reduction and Analysis \nBranch of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, refers to FLL (2002b) when he \nstates that \u2018World Bank studies on the comparative causes of violent crime show a strong \ncorrelation between incidents of violent crime and high levels of inequality\u2019. With the \nexception of Bourguignon (2001) and Neumayer (2003) none of these authors seem to question \nFLL\u2019s findings. This article complements the latter study by looking at violent property crime. \n \nResearch Design \nThe dependent variable \nThere are two main sources of cross-national data on robbery\/violent theft: the United Nations \n(UN) and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol). Contrary to Interpol data, \nwhich are directly reported by police organisations, the United Nations Crime Surveys (UNCS) \nare answered by governments, even though they are most likely derived from statistics \ngathered by police organisations as well. FLL (2002 a, b) base their analysis on data from the \nUNCS. One of the problems with this is that the coverage of countries is rather limited and \nnon-representative, encompassing at maximum 37 countries. Developed countries are over-\nrepresented as are Central and South American as well as Asian countries among the non-\ndeveloped ones. In contrast, the Interpol data are available for more and a wider variety of \ncountries. \n5 \nThe dependent variable in this study is the number of robberies and violent thefts per one \nmillion inhabitants. Data have been collected from Interpol (various years) instead of UNCS \n(various years) to create a larger and more representative sample (up to 59 versus up to 37), as \nargued above. Following Neapolitan\u2019s suggestion (1997: 32ff.), each observation was checked \nfor obvious mis-reporting. Where data for a single or a few years were substantially out of line \nwith the values from prior or consecutive years, then an observation was taken out. For some \ncountries with several temporal breaks in a time-series, the whole series was set to missing. \nAppendix 1 describes which observations failed to pass this test of inspection. Note, however, \nthat the results reported below hardly change if these observations are not deleted from the \nsample (detailed results available upon request). The same is true if observations are deleted \naccording to Belsley, Kuh & Welsch\u2019s (1980) DFITS criterion. Appendix 2 lists the countries \nincluded in the regression with the largest sample size. Note that not all countries report crime \nrates in all years and also due to the deletion of dubious data not all countries have \nobservations over the entire period of study. With the exception of Peru, which falls victim to \nour data inspection process, Hong Kong, Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago are the only \ncountries included in FLL (2002b), but not in our sample, and the reason for this is non-\navailability of data for the explanatory variables for at least two periods of time. \nAs in Neumayer (2003) we decided to use 1980 as a cut-off point. Neapolitan (1997) \nsuggests that data from before the 1980s are far less reliable than later data. Any remaining \nreporting error will be captured by the error term of our estimating equation. Such error renders \nour estimations less precise and raises the standard errors of the estimated coefficients. It does \nnot, however, bias the estimates as long as the error is not systematically related to some of our \nexplanatory variables. In this respect, the variable that is most problematic is the income level \nsince Soares (2002) suggests that poor countries tend to under-report crime more than rich \ncountries. Under-reporting might also be a problem in autocratic regimes. The coefficient size \n6 \nof the income and democracy variables can therefore be expected to be inflated by \nmeasurement error and the reported coefficients of all variables will be somewhat biased. In \nthe absence of accurate information on the amount of bias, there is little scholars can do to \navoid this problem, which equally affects FLL (2002a,b). \n \nThe explanatory variables \nAs our main variable of income inequality, we use the Gini coefficient measuring the \nconcentration of incomes between the extremes of 0 (absolute equality) and 1 (maximum \ninequality). Data are taken from UN-WIDER (2000), which is more comprehensive in \ncoverage than Deininger & Squire (1996). However, our results on income inequality do not \ndepend on using the UN-WIDER source. Using only Deininger & Squire (1996) as the source \nof data instead makes no difference. Like FLL (2002a,b) we follow Deininger & Squire\u2019s \n(1996: 582) suggestion and add 6.6 to Gini coefficients derived from expenditure instead of \nincome surveys. Also similar to FLL (2002a,b) we take the Gini coefficients of the highest \nquality first and averages of lower quality observations only where high quality ones are not \navailable. \nSome recent work argues, however, that the Gini coefficient might not be the most \nrelevant measure of inequality with respect to crime. For example, empirical work by \nBourguignon, Nu\u00f1ez & Sanchez (2003) suggests that it is the relative income of the population \nwith standards of living below 80 per cent of the mean that matters (see also Chiu & Madden, \n1998). Unfortunately, in a cross-national setting the availability of detailed data on income \ndistributions within countries is severely restricted. The only alternative indicator of income \ninequality we can employ is the ratio of the top to the bottom quintile of the income \ndistribution, a measure also used by FLL (2002b). Data are taken from Deininger & Squire \n(1996). Unfortunately, this measure has less availability than the Gini measure. \n7 \nAs control variables, we include the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in \npurchasing power parity and constant prices of 1997, its growth rate, the unemployment rate, \nthe urbanization rate, the female labour force participation rate and the share of males in the \nage group 15 to 64. Additionally, we use the Polity measure of democracy (Gurr & Jaggers, \n2000). Human rights violation is measured by the Purdue Political Terror Scales (Gibney, \n2002). All these variables are suggested as potentially important determinants by the \ntheoretical literature on violent crime \u2013 see Neuman & Berger (1988), Neapolitan (1997) and \nNeumayer (2003) for details. Of these variables, the female labour force participation rate is \nperhaps the one that is least intuitively plausible. Opportunity theory suggests that a higher \nfemale labour force participation rate leads to reduced guardianship for potential offenders, \nthus raising the rate of violent property crime. Unless otherwise stated, data are taken from UN \n(1999) and World Bank (2001). In accordance with most empirical studies we take the natural \nlog of income per capita to render its distribution less skewed. \nTable I provides summary descriptive variable information. Table II reports a correlation \nmatrix of variables after fixed-effects transformation, which does not suggest that \nmulticollinearity is likely to be a problem in our estimations. In addition, variance inflation \nfactors were computed and pointed in the same direction. \n< Insert Tables I and II about here > \n \nThe methodology \nWe take three year averages of the dependent and all independent variables for the period 1980 \nto 1997 to reduce the impact of atypically high or low rates in any one single year. Our model \nto be estimated is as follows: \n \n8 \nln(yit) = \u03b1 + \u03b2x'it  + (ai + uit) \n \nTime is indicated by t, countries by i, ln(y) is the logged rate of robbery and violent theft \nper one million people, \u03b1 is a constant, x' contains the explanatory variables, \u03b2 is the \ncorresponding vector of coefficients to be estimated. The log-transformation of the dependent \nvariable was undertaken to mitigate problems with heteroscedasticity of the error term. The ai \nrepresent individual country effects capturing cultural and other (approximately) time-invariant \nfactors. Their inclusion ensures that unobserved country heterogeneity is accounted for. The \nfixed-effects estimator is based on the time variation within each cross-sectional unit only. \nIn further estimations, we use a random-effects estimator, which draws upon both the \ncross-sectional and temporal variation in the data. It is more efficient than the fixed-effects \nestimator, but leads to consistent estimations only if the assumption is correct that the country \neffects are not correlated with the explanatory variables. In addition, like FLL (2002a, b) we \nalso include a lagged dependent variable in separate estimations and estimate the model with a \nso-called systems generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator based on Arellano & \nBond (1991) and Arellano & Bover (1995). A hysteresis effect might exist if, for example, \ncriminals base their current year\u2019s behavior on past information (Sah, 1991). The GMM \nestimator also accounts for the possibility that the explanatory variables are partially \nendogenous. However, like FLL (2002a, b) we assume that all explanatory variables are at \nleast weakly exogenous, that is the explanatory variables may be endogenous to past and \ncurrent values of the dependent variables, but not to its future ones. The need to instrument the \ndependent variable with its lagged values in order to avoid correlation with the error term leads \nto the loss of one time period and often substantial losses in the efficiency of estimation \n(Wooldridge, 2002). FLL (2002a, b) use the two-step (rather than one-step) dynamic GMM \nestimator. The problem with this is that Arellano & Bond (1991: 291) themselves explicitly \n9 \nwarn against using the two-step estimator as it is known to underestimate standard errors. For \nthis reason we use the one-step estimator. \nIn pre-testing, we searched for non-linear effects of any of the explanatory variables. \nHowever, we found evidence for such effects only for the income variable. All variables \ntherefore enter the regressions only in linear form with the exception of the income variable, \nfor which both a linear and a squared term are entered. \n \nResults \nTable III presents our estimation results with the Gini coefficient, table IV presents results with \nthe ratio of the top to bottom income quintile as the measure of income inequality. Column 1 \nreports results from fixed effects estimation, where the regression is constrained such that no \ncountries and no control variables are included other than those also included in FLL (2002b).1 \nThe result on the Gini coefficient mirrors FLL\u2019s (2002a, b) finding as it is positive and \nstatistically significant. In column 2 we add the squared term of the log of per capita income as \nwell as additional control variables that are suggested by theory as determinants of violent \ncrime, keeping the sample of countries still the same. It can be seen that the Gini coefficient \nremains positive and significant despite the fact that its significance is somewhat reduced. In \nother words, drawing data for violent crime from a different source (Interpol versus UNCS) \nand introducing more control variables does not change FLL\u2019s (2002a, b) main result that \nincome inequality is associated with a higher violent crime rate. Per capita income has a non-\nlinear effect on violent property crime. An increase in income leads to an increase in violent \nproperty crime over a range of income, but at a decreasing rate. The positive link over a range \nof income levels could be either because higher income raises the value of things to be robbed, \nrendering violent property crime more attractive, or because reporting of such crimes is higher \nin richer countries as argued by Soares (2002).2 The female labour force participation rate, the \n10 \nunemployment rate, our measure of democracy and the measure of human rights violation are \nall positively associated with robbery\/violent theft. All of these are in line with expectations. \nThe economic growth rate and the share of males between the age of 15 and 64 are statistically \ninsignificant, however. What is very much contrary to expectation is the negative and \nsignificant coefficient of the urbanisation rate. In column 3, we no longer artificially constrain \nthe sample of countries. As a consequence, the sample size increases to 50 countries and the \nGini coefficient becomes insignificant. The control variables test as before, with the exception \nof the urbanisation rate. This suggests that its strange and counter-intuitive statistically \nsignificant negative sign might have been caused by constraining the sample to a small and \nnon-representative number of countries. It also suggests that the positive and significant \ncoefficient of the Gini measure is likely to be due to the same effect. If we exclude the \ninsignificant variables from the model, then the results are generally as before (column 4). If, in \naddition, we exclude the unemployment rate, which is now insignificant and whose inclusion \nconstrains sample size, then the sample now covers 59 countries in column 5 with little effect \non the results. In particular, the Gini coefficient remains insignificant. Column 6 reports results \nfrom the systems GMM estimator. Beside the lagged dependent variable, only the economic \ngrowth and the unemployment rate are statistically significant and their coefficients are \nnegative and positive, respectively, as theory would predict. Importantly, the Gini coefficient \nremains insignificant. If one were to exclude the other insignificant variables from the model, \nthis hardly affects the results. The Gini coefficient becomes very marginally significant at the \n10 percent level now, but it has a negative sign, suggesting that if anything higher inequality is \nassociated with a lower rate of violent robbery and theft (results not shown). \n< Insert Table III about here > \nColumn 7 re-estimates the static model with a random effects estimator. Results are \ngenerally rather similar to the fixed effects model. Importantly, however, the Gini measure of \n11 \nincome inequality assumes statistical significance together with the expected positive sign. \nKeep in mind though that the random-effects estimation results are only consistent if the \nexplanatory variables are not correlated with the country-specific fixed effects. The Hausman \ntest result rejects the assumption of no correlation and thus rejects the random effects \nassumption. \nTable IV repeats the analysis of table III with the ratio of the top to bottom income \nquintile as the measure of inequality. Results are similar to those of table III. In particular, this \nalternative measure of income inequality is also highly significant in the regression with the \nconstrained sample size and a constrained number of control variables (column 1). Adding \nfurther control variables reduces the statistical significance of the inequality measure, but does \nnot render it insignificant (column 2). As with the Gini coefficient, the quintile ratio becomes \ninsignificant if we no longer artificially restrict the sample size (column 3). Dropping the \ninsignificant variables from the model does not change this result as the ratio of the top to \nbottom income quintile remains insignificant, whether we restrict the sample to be the same as \nin column 3 or not (columns 4 and 5). In systems GMM estimation the inequality measure \nremains insignificant (column 6). Compared to column 6 of table III, the share of males \nbetween the ages of 15 and 64 is also significant. As with the dynamic estimation in table III, \nthese results do not change if the insignificant variables are dropped (results not shown). The \ncoefficient of the inequality variable becomes significant in the more representative sample \nwith a larger number of countries only in static random effects estimation (column 7). The \nHausman test again rejects the hypothesis that the explanatory variables are not correlated with \ncountry-specific effects. \n< Insert Table IV about here > \n \n12 \nConclusion \nNo matter whether income inequality is measured by the Gini coefficient or by the ratio of the \ntop to the bottom income quintile, it is insignificant in fixed effects and dynamic estimation \nand significant only in random effects estimation, unless the sample of countries is constrained \nto contain no other countries than those included in FLL (2002b). Our results suggest that if we \nallow for a more representative sample and control for country-specific fixed effects, then \nincome inequality no longer is a statistically significant determinant of violent crime. I \nconclude from the results reported above that the link between income inequality and violent \ncrime is far less robust than FLL seem to suggest. The claim that income inequality is a major \ncause of violent crime is therefore questionable.  \nOf course, it could be that there is too much noise and too little real over-time variation \nin the income inequality data such that the within-country variation in inequality is not \nsufficient to render the coefficient statistically significantly different from zero. However, there \nis not much more variation in other variables either and still they turn out significant in accord \nwith theoretical expectations in fixed effects estimation (e.g., the per capita income level and \nfemale labour force participation). An alternative explanation could be that country specific \nfixed effects simultaneously affect both inequality and crime such that without controlling for \nthese effects inequality spuriously picks up these effects (Freeman, 1996). Without good \ninstruments for inequality, which are extremely hard to come by, it is impossible to tell which \nis the case. Quite possibly, there are limits to identifying the effects of inequality on violent \ncrime at the cross-national level and more micro-oriented studies such as Bourguignon, Nu\u00f1ez \n& Sanchez (2003) are more promising in this regard. \n13 \nTable I.

The data used in this article as well as the routines used to generate the \nresults with Stata 8 can be found at http:\/\/www.prio.no\/jpr\/datasets.htm. \n1\n FLL (2002b) also include an educational attainment variable based on the average years of schooling of the \npopulation over 15 from a dataset constructed by Robert Barro and Jon-Wha Lee. This variable is not included here \nas it would further reduce sample size and is not consistently significant in FLL (2002b) either. It is unclear to this \nauthor why the inclusion of this variable does not further constrain the sample size reported by FLL (2002b). \n2\n In this regression, the estimated turning point is at around US$19,000, after which further income increases are \nassociated with a lower rate of violent crime. The estimated turning point differs somewhat from regression to \nregression, but is always above the mean income level with the exception of regression 5 of table III. \n"}
