Carter, M\u2019ember, IEEE\u2019 \nAbstract \nTechniques based on the perturbation of cavity resonators are commonly used to measure the \npermittivity and permeability of samples of dielectric and ferrite materials at microwave \nfrequencies. They are also used to measure the local electric and magnetic field strengths in \nmicrowave structures including the shunt impedances of cavity resonators and the coupling \nimpedances of slow-wave structures. This paper re-examines the assumptions made in the \ntheory of these techniques and provides estimates of the errors of measurement arising from \nthem. \n1. Introduction \nWhen a small object is introduced into a microwave cavity resonator the resonant frequency \nis perturbed [l, 21. Because it is possible to measure the change in frequency with high \naccuracy this provides a valuable method for measuring the electric and magnetic properties \nof the object if the properties of the cavity are known, or for characterising the cavity if the \nproperties of the perturber are known. Techniques based upon this principle are in common \nuse for measuring the dielectric and magnetic properties of materials at microwave frequencies \n[3]. They also used for measuring the local electric and magnetic field strengths within \nmicrowave structures and, especially, for finding the shunt impedances of cavity resonators \nfor use in klystrons and particle accelerators and the coupling impedances of slow-wave \nstructures for use in travelling-wave tubes and linear accelerators [.4, 5, 61. The theoretical \nbasis of these measurements is well-established but involves some simplifications. This paper \nre-examines these assumptions and approximations to show the effect which they have on the \naccuracy of the measurements. \n\u2018R.G. Carter is with the Engineering Department, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 \n4YR, U.K. \n1 \n2. Theory \nThe theory of the perturbation of cavity resonators has been given by a number of authors. \nThe treatment given here is essentially that presented by Waldron [l] but with some \ndifferences which maintain the symmetry of the equations. We shall study the properties of \ntwo identical cavity resonators containing non-conducting perturbing objects. Let the fields \nin the two cavities be E, exp jo,t and Ho exp jw,t and E, exp jqt and H, exp jqt. Making \nuse of Maxwell\u2019s curl equations we obtain \nV x E. = -jw,B, (1) \nV x HI = jwlD, (2) \nTaking the scalar product of H, with eq.1 and E, with eq.2 and subtracting gives \nH,.(V x E,) - E,.(V x H,) = -jo$ll.Bo - jwlEo.D1 (3) \nBut \nV.(Eo x HI) = H,.(V x E,) - E,.(V x H,) (4) \nTherefore \nV.(Eo x H,) = -jo,H,.B, - jolEo.D, \nIntegrating eq.5 over the volume of the cavity, and making use of Gauss\u2019 Theorem \nsss \nV.A dv = \nss \nA.dS \nyields \nU \ns (E, x H,).dS = JJJ, ( -jaoH,.Bo - jolEo.D, ) dv \n1 \n(5) \n(6) \n(7) \nWhere S is the surface of the cavity and V its volume. By a similar argument, exchanging the \nsubscripts, we obtain \nu s (El x H,).dS = sfs y ( -jalHo.B, - jwoEl.D, ) dv (8) \n2 \nIf the walls of the cavity can be regarded as perfectly conducting then E is normal to the wall \nand H is tangential to the wall. The vector products are thus tangential to the wall and the left \nhand sides of equations 7 and 8 are zero. Equating the right hand sides of eqs.7 and 8 and re- \narranging gives \nj\u201c, j-_\/j+, ( E,.D, - H,.B, ) dv = _b, \/J[, ( Eo.D, - Ho.B, ) dv (9) \nIf we now assume that the cavity with subscript 0 is empty and let o, = o,, + AU eq. 9 can \nbe re-arranged to give \n&L sss V [ ( El.Do - Eo.D, ) - ( H1.Bo - Ho.B, ) ] dv \nfss \n\\ I \nv ( EO.4 - f&B, ) dv \n(101 \nThe integrand in the numerator of this equation is zero everywhere outside the volume of the \nperturbing object. We may therefore restrict the volume of integration to the volume of the \n? \nobject denoted by s\/, Thus \nAA!= sss VI ( E,.D, - E,.D, > - ( Hl.Bo - Ho.B, ) dv \nwO \nsss V \n( Eo.D, - Ho.B, ) dv \n(11) \nThe only assumption which has been made so far is that the cavity walls are perfectly \nconducting. There is no restriction on the size or shape of the perturbing object, or of its \nmaterial provided that it is not conducting. The symmetry of eq.11 ensures that its validity \nis independent of the magnitudes of the fields in the two cavities. For a non-magnetic object \nthe second bracket in the numerator of eq.11 is zero and \n.!SL sss Vl ( E,.D, - Eo.D, ) dv \nOO sss V ( Eo.D, - Ho. B, ) dv \n(12) \nIf we set E, = E, + e and similarly for the other variables eq.11 becomes \n3 \nA0 sss \n( e.D, - E,.d ) - ( LB, - H,.b ) dv \n(13) \nOO sss V ( Eo.Do - HoJo ) + ( E,.d - Ho.6 ) dv \nEquations 11, 12 and 13 cannot be applied directly because it is not normally possible to find \nclosed-form expressions for the fields in the perturbed cavity. In order to derive useful \nformulae certain approximations must be made. \nAssmption I: The perturber is made of homogeneous isotropic material so that D and \nB can be expressed in terms of E, H and the permittivity and \npermeability of the material. Equation 11 becomes \n60= sss v, E ~~(1 - QEo.E1 - cr,(l - p,)H,.H, I dv (14) \nOO sss V ( E,.D, - Ho.B, ) dv \nAssmption 2: The perturbation is small so that the second term in the denominator of \neq. 13 can be neglected. Equation 14 becomes \nAssumption 3: \n&L sss V\u2018 [ ~~(1 - EJE~.E~ - po(l - p,)Ho.H1 ] dv \nsss V \n( Eo.Do - Ho.Bo ) dv \n(15) \nThis assumption has removed the symmetry of the equation so that the \nfrequency perturbation is dependent on the relative amplitudes of the \nfields in the empty and perturbed cavities. The denominator is \nrecognised as 4W, where V, is the the stored energy in the empty \ncavity. \nThe perturber is small enough for E and H to be effectively constant \nwithin it so that the numerator is equal to the integrand multiplied by \nthe volume of the perturber. Equation 15 becomes \nAssumption 4: \n_&= 1 sJ1 - QEo.E, - P,U - I.@,.H, 1 VI \n4 wo (16) wO \nThe E and H fields outside the pet-turber are unchanged by its presence \nand those within the perturber can be determined from the boundary \nconditions at its surface. This enables simple expressions for the \nfrequency perturbation to be derived in two cases: \na) Long thin cylindrical dielectric rod aligned parallel to E,,: \nSince the tangential electric field is continuous at the surface of the rod ( Y = b ) it follows \nthat E, = E,:, and, since K = 1, equation 16 reduces to the usual approximate formula for \nperturbation of the frequency by a thin dielectric rod: \nAAL \n~~(1 - EJ IEooj2 xb2L \nOO 4 J-6 \nwhere E,], is the magnitude of Eti on the axis and L is the length of the rod. \n(17) \nb) Dielectric sphere: \nUnder the quasi-static approximation the electric \nuniform external electric field E, is given by [7] \nfield within a dielectric sphere placed in a \nE, = _?!%_ \nE, + 2 \n(18) \nSubstitution of this expression into equation 16 and taking ~1, = 1 yields the usual expression \nfor the perturbation of the frequency by a small dielectric sphere: \nALio _ = - \n0 \n(19) \nwhere R is the radius of the sphere. \nIt is generally assumed that these approximate expressions are accurate enough for most \npurposes but the range of validity of the assumptions has not been checked. In the sections \nwhich follow we examine this problem by comparing the approximate solutions with those \nobtained by direct application of eq.12. \n3. Perturbation of a pill-box cavity by a dielectric rod \nConsider a pill-box cavity, excited in the TM,,, mode, which is perturbed by a cylindrical \ndielectric rod placed along its axis as shown in fig. 1 a. The general solutions for the electric \nfield inside and outside the rod are \nEl = El = AJ,(fik,r) \nEl = Ez = BJ,(k,r) + CY,(k,r) \n(20) \n(21) \nwhere A, B and C are constants, J, and Y,, are the Bessel functions of the first and second \nkinds and k, = o, \/ c where c is the velocity of light in vacuum. We can choose A = 1 \nwithout loss of generality. The constants B and C are determined by requiring that E, and \ni3Ez \/ & are continuous at the surface of the rod so that \nc = -B.J,(k,u) \/ Y,(k,a) \nThe requirement that E, is zero at r = a yields the, determinantal equation \n(23) \n(24) \n(25) \nThis equation can be solved numerically* to obtain k, and o, for given values of a, b and E,. \nThe results presented in this paper were obtained using Mathcad,8. \n6 \nFor the empty cavity we note that \nq, = koc = 2.405( c\/a ) (26) \nSince the solutions scale directly with the dimensions we can display the ratio O,\/CO, against \nb\/d for various values of E, as shown in fig.2. \nIn the empty cavity the electric field is given by \nE. = EL = Jo&t) \nand the magnetic field by \nHo = He = j \nIn the perturbed cavity the magnetic field ig \nHI = He = j & I-- % J,(JiSrkor) \ninside the rod, and \nHI = He = j 1 BJJk,r) + CYJk,r) 1 \noutside the rod. \n(27) \n(28) \nw \nWhen the fields defined by these equations are substitufed into eq. 12 the results are identical \nto those obtained from eq.25.. \nThe stored energy in the empty cavity is given by \na \nW. = xeOL \nJ \nJ,(k,r)\u201crdr \n0 \nSubstituting this expression into eq. 17, and noting that E,, = 1, we obtain \n(31) \n.&L \nwO \n1.856( 1 - ~,)(W2 (32) \nThe frequency ratios computed from eq.32 for relative permittivities of 2, 5 and 10 are \ncompared with the exact results in figure 2. It is seen that there is good agreement between \nthe two sets of results if b\/a I 0.1 and that the agreement deteriorates as b\/a increases and as \nthe relative permittivity increases. The accuracy is revealed more clearly in figures 3a and b \nwhich show the error in the approximate solutions for the ranges 0 < b\/a < 0.1 and 0 < b\/a \n< 0.2 respectively. If the normalised rod diameter is less than 0.1 the approximate solution \nis accurate to better than 1% for E, I 10. If E, = 2 the difference between the exact and \napproximate formulae is negligible. But these results conceal possible sources of error which \nmake it unwise to assume that the same accuracies will apply to other shapes of the \nperturbing object. \nFigure 4 shows comparisons between the numerators and denominators of the exact and \napproximate expressions (equations 12 and 17). From these it is clear that the apparent \naccuracy of eq.17 is a consequence of the balancing of approximately equal errors in the \nnumerator and the denominator. These errors lie in the range 1% - 30% for the cases \ninvestigated. Thus the assumption that the second term in the denominator of eq. 13 can be \nneglected is not as valid as has been generally supposed. The physical explanation of this \nresult is that the electric field within the rod is over;estimated by assumption 3 since the \nradial variation of the field within the rod has been neglected. The field outside the rod is \nreduced by the presence of the rod so that assumption 2 causes the denominator to be over- \nestimated. It is fortuitous that the errors compensate each other in this case but it is not safe \nto assume that a similar cancellation will occur in other cases. It is therefore possible that \nmeasurements made using perturbation methods may be in error by several percent. \n8 \nOne of the main uses of this theory is to determine the relative permittivities of samples of \ndielectric material in the form of rods. Since the method relies on the frequency perturbation \ncaused by the rod it is sensitive to quite small errors in the value of the perturbed frequency. \nThis is illustrated in fig.5 in which values of the frequency perturbation obtained from the \nexact theory have been used to obtain the relative permittivity from eq.32. It can be seen that \nappreciable errors occur when the relative permittivity is calculated by the approximate \nmethod. \n4. Perturbation of a pill-box cavity by a dielectric sphere \nWhen a dielectric sphere is place in a uniform electric field the field within the sphere is \ngiven by eq. 18 and the additional electric field components outside the sphere produced by \nthe polarisation of the sphere are [7]: \nE, = E. (5) R3 (y+) (33) \nin spherical polar co-ordinates. \nWe will assume that the dielectric sphere is placed on the axis of a pill-box cavity as shown \nin fig. 1 b. In order to be able to compute the frequency perturbation from eq. 12 it is necessary \nto make two assumptions: \nAssumption 5: The sphere is small enough for the field in which it is placed to be \neffectively constant. If we require the variation of the field to be not \nmore than 1% over the space occupied by the sphere then kJ? = 0.2 \nand thus R\/a < 0.083. For a 5% field variation R\/a I 0.19. \nAssumption 6: The sphere is small enough for the perturbation of the external field to \nbe effectively zero on the boundary of the cavity. If we set a limit of \n1% on the perturbation then R\/a and 2RIL 50.2. Thus for most cavities \nthe second condition will be satisfied whenever the first condition is \ntrue. \nThe field components outside the sphere are given, in cylindrical polar co-ordinates, by: \n(35) \n-j aElz qe = -- \nPool ar \nP-3 \nwhere CD, is the, as yet unknown, perturbed frequency. The remaining field components are \nnot required because their inner products with the unperturbed field components are zero. \nWithin the sphere, for consistency, we must take E,, = E,, and H,, = 0. Equation 12 can then \nbe evaluated numerically to obtain values for the frequency perturbation which are exact for \nsmall spheres. Figure 6 shows how the ratio of the perturbed to the unperturbed frequency \ndepends upon the radius and the relative permittivity of the sphere as found from the \napproximate and exact calculations. Since we have used the same expression for the electric \nfield inside the sphere for both the approximate and exact calculations it follows that fig.6 \nshows the effect of neglecting the second term in the denominator of eq.13 in this case. The \nerror introduced by this assumption is much less than in the case of perturbation by a rod \nbecause of the much smaller change in the fields outside the perturber. \nPerturbation measurements using a dielectric sphere are commonly used to determine the \nelectric field distribution within a microwave structure. By substituting the frequency \nperturbation computed from eq. 12 into eq. 19 we can\u2019 find the error in the determination of the \nfield. The results of this calculation in fig.7 show that the error is less than 1% for typical \nsizes of sphere. \n5. Conclusions \nThe results presented in this paper have shown that the assumptions made in the approximate \n10 \ntheory of the perturbation of cavities by dielectric objects are not always valid. In particular \nwe have seen that the figures for the relative permittivity of dielectric rods may be in error \nby 5% for typical rod sizes. If the method is used to find the relative permittivity of rods \nhaving a uniform, but non-circular, cross-section it is likely that similar accuracies will be \nobtained. When perturbation methods are used to characterise cavity resonators and other \nmicrowave structures it is likely that the relative permittivity of the perturber will have been \nobtained by a perturbation measurement. In that case the errors in measurement should be \nsmall provided that the same assumptions were made in interpreting both measurements and \nthat the assumption that the perturber is located in a region of uniform electric field is \nsatisfied to a good approximation. \nReferences \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n5. \n6. \n7. \nWaldron, R.A., Perturbation theory of resonant cavities, Procedings IEE, Vol.l07C, \npp.272-274, September 1960 \nKraszewski, A.W., and Nelson, S.O., Observations on resonant cavity perturbation by \ndielectric objects, IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques, Vo.40, \npp.151-155, January 1992 \nAltschuler, H.M., Dielectric Constant in Handbook of Microwave Measurements (3rd \nedn.), Sucher, M. and Fox, J.
