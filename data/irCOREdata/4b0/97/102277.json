These states are created by the application of a magnetic field along\nthe growth direction of an InAs\/AlSb quantum well. A clear suppression of the cooling rate is seen, from\n1012 s21 when the level spacing is equal to the phonon energy, to 1010 s21 away from this resonance, and thus\nthe results provide unambiguous evidence for the phonon bottleneck. Furthermore, the lifetimes had only weak\ndependence on temperature between 4 and 80 K. @S0163-1829~99!50612-7#Electronic lifetimes of two-dimensional ~2D! systems in\nmagnetic fields are of fundamental interest in part because\nthe quantization effect of the magnetic field mimics the ef-\nfect of a quantum dot potential with an easily variable degree\nof confinement.1 The magnetic field perpendicular to the lay-\ners forces the electrons into confined orbits and the density\nof states becomes a ladder of broadened d functions similar\nto that of a quantum dot. Recently much work has been\ncarried out on the so-called \u2018\u2018phonon bottleneck\u2019\u2019 that has\nbeen claimed to inhibit the cooling of carriers in quantum\ndots when the level separation is not equal to the phonon\nenergy.2\u20136 However, partly as a result of different groups\nusing different growth techniques for interband photolumi-\nnescence samples and partly on fundamental grounds, this is\ncontroversial and is the subject of much debate.7\u201312 Indeed\nseveral mechanisms have been proposed that may bypass the\nbottleneck, such as multiphonon scattering,7 Auger\nprocesses,8 excitonic effects,9 and defect related processes.10\nIn the present work we observe clear phonon suppression in\nn-type quasi 0D dots ~i.e., Landau quantized rather than spa-\ntially quantized! by a time-resolved intraband absorption\nmeasurement. This provides unambiguous evidence for the\nphonon bottleneck effect independently of arguments con-\ncerning which processes dominate in the interband photolu-\nminescence measurements in dots3\u20136,9\u201312 and quasi dots13\nsuch as electron-hole scattering. Further, because of the very\nclean model system ~much sharper interfaces and no wetting\nlayer, etc.!, the interpretation is not complicated by detailed\nquestions about different growth techniques and the quality\nof different dot sample structures. The results should assist in\nthe understanding of which aspect of these processes is fun-\ndamental and which is dependent on sample structure.PRB 590163-1829\/99\/59~12!\/7817~4!\/$15.00Resonant absorption of longitudinal optic ~LO! phonons\ncauses a variety of transport properties to oscillate with ap-\nplied magnetic field, such as the magnetoresistance.14 Reso-\nnant phonon scattering occurs when\nDl \\vc5\\vLO , ~1!\nwhere \\vLO is the LO phonon energy, \\vc5\\eB\/m* is the\ncyclotron energy, and Dl is an integer. At these resonances\nthe LO phonon absorption\/emission probability is strongly\nenhanced giving rise to large changes in the electron energy\nrelaxation lifetime.15,16 In the present work we have used the\npump-probe technique, with cyclotron resonance, to quanti-\ntatively determine the relaxation time associated with the\nphonon bottleneck effect away from resonance. We show\nadditionally that the phonon bottleneck is temperature inde-\npendent at least up to 80 K.\nBleaching of the absorption of a harmonic ladder of states\nis impossible since the populations of adjacent states can\nnever be equal for the entire ladder, i.e., further absorption is\nalways possible. Nonlinear optical measurements of the life-\ntime, i.e., saturation or pump-probe techniques, are therefore\nonly possible when some form of anharmonicity terminates\nphoton absorption at some point. Because of the lack of band\nnonparabolicity, previous saturation measurements on GaAs\nquantum wells were limited to a small range of energies\ndetermined by the requirement that either the resonant po-\nlaron effect17,18 or an anticrossing with other subbands19 ter-\nminates the Landau level ladder. In the former case, for ex-\nample, the measurement is only possible if the state\noriginally at \\vLO is bent strongly off resonance and does\nnot therefore take part in the relaxation process.

MURDIN et al.samples having very narrow linewidths with low enough car-\nrier concentration not to screen the polaron effect. The har-\nmonicity of the rest of the ladder means that Auger ~electron-\nelectron! processes will eventually raise carriers above the\nphonon energy after which a fast deexcitation can occur ~this\nis shown schematically in the inset of Fig. 1!. The electron-\nelectron part of the sequential process has been shown to be\nthe slowest ~i.e., dominating! leg from the observation of an\nn dependence of the lifetime.17,20\nWe show here a combination of pump-probe and satura-\ntion measurements of the cyclotron resonance in an InAs\/\nAlSb quantum well. This narrow gap material (Eg\n50.42 eV in InAs! has sufficient band nonparabolicity so\nthat higher Landau levels are bent out of resonance ~see Fig.\n1 inset!. The Landau level ladder is thus truncated and satu-\nration is possible over a wide range of energies. This enables\ndetermination of the energy relaxation lifetime both below\nand above the LO phonon energy, even with carrier concen-\ntrations high enough to suppress the polaron effect.\nThe sample studied was a 15-nm InAs quantum well,\ngrown between AlSb barriers by molecular beam epitaxy on\nan undoped GaAs substrate. Thick strain relaxing layers of\n0.8-mm GaSb and 0.8-mm AlSb followed by a 10 period\nsuperlattice of ~2.5-nm AlSb, 2.5-nm GaSb! were grown on\nthe substrate. The 20-nm AlSb barrier, 15-nm InAs well, and\n15-nm AlSb barrier were capped with 12-nm GaSb. The\nwell\/barrier interfaces were InSb-like. The carrier density at\nhelium temperatures has been determined by transport mea-\nsurements to be 531011 cm22 (8.531011 cm22 at 77 K! with\na mobility of 262 000 cm2\/V s. The electron effective mass,\nas determined from the cyclotron absorption, was 0.035m0 .\nThe picosecond resolution measurements were performed\nFIG. 1.

Each macropulse consists of a train of micropulses\nseparated by 40 ns, which have an energy of 1\u201310 mJ. The\nmicropulse length is controllable between 1\u201310 ps.\nThe sample was mounted in vacuum on a cold finger, in\nthe Faraday configuration of a horizontal bore superconduct-\ning magnet. In the saturation experiments the laser frequency\nwas fixed and the transmission was measured versus field for\ndifferent laser intensities. The cyclotron absorption was\nbleached at high intensity and the lowest laser frequency for\nwhich this was fully achieved was 13.7 meV. The high-\nfrequency limit was determined by the magnet and was 40\nmeV. For the pump-probe experiments the laser was split\ninto two beams, and calibrated wire-mesh attenuators were\nused to independently control the intensities so as to achieve\nfull saturation by the pump but linear absorption only by the\nprobe. The intensities used were estimated to be typically\n100 and 1 kW cm22 for the pump and probe, respectively.\nFor a given fixed magnetic field, the pump-probe experi-\nments were performed with the laser fixed at the cyclotron\nfrequency. Using \\vLO529.5 meV for InAs, the resonant\nphonon scattering @Eq. ~1!# occurs at \\vc529.5, 14.8, 9.8\nmeV etc. Example pump-probe results are shown in Fig. 1\nfor sample temperatures of 4 and 80 K both near to reso-\nnance at 15 meV and away from it, at 18 meV. When the\nlaser was detuned from the cyclotron frequency the pump-\nprobe bleaching effect disappeared. The inverse lifetimes de-\nrived from the decay curves are shown as a function of level\nseparation in Fig. 2. Both the results for 4 K and 80 K are\nshown. The scattering rate away from resonance is strongly\nsuppressed compared with that on resonance. Although there\nis a clear difference in the lifetimes at 4 and 80 K, there is\nlittle difference in the suppression factor. The paradoxical\nresult that the lifetime increases with temperature at low\ntemperatures has been predicted previously for 0D states16\nand is actually observed here. We discuss the temperature\ndependence below.\nWe have calculated the inter-Landau level scattering\nprobability by LO phonon emission alone16,22 using the wave\nfunctions from a 14-band k\u0095p calculation, shown in Fig. 3.\nThe full width at half maximum broadening of the matrix\nelement of the LO interaction was taken to be 0.3 meV, a\nFIG. 2.

The scattering rate also varies from reso-\nnance to resonance and decreases with increasing Dl . Thus\nthe Dl51 resonance at B;8 T is stronger than for Dl52 at\nB;4 T. We emphasize that the variation from resonance to\nresonance in the quasi dot calculation parallels the real dot\nsituation where the phonon relaxation may be significantly\nsuppressed by a reduction in the matrix element between the\nphonon and electronic states ~this is in addition to the obvi-\nous suppression required by energy conservation!. Transi-\ntions between successively higher pairs of levels are pushed\nto higher fields by the nonparabolicity. These scattering rates\nare fed into a rate equation model for the level filling factors,\nwhich has no free parameters, as follows:\nd f l\ndt 5F@Al212Al#2 (l8,l\nF f l~12 f l8!t ll8 G1 (l8.l F\nf l8~12 f l!\nt l8l\nG ,\n~2!\nwhere F is the photon flux density, Al is the absorption from\nlevel l!l11, and t ll8 are the LO phonon lifetimes from Fig.\n3. Al can be found from consideration of a conducting sheet\nwith the Drude conductivity s l ~which contains the Lorent-\nzian dependence on magnetic field! on top of a dielectric\nsubstrate.17 The total transmission, T tot(Ssl) as a function of\ntime is shown as the solid lines in Fig. 1, and the inverse\ndecay time of T tot is shown as the solid line in Fig. 2. Excel-\nlent agreement is found at all except the highest energy,\nwhere high reststrahlen reflections made measurements more\ndifficult. The model involves only one fitting parameter, the\nbroadening, and the populations do depend upon the mea-\nsured absorption cross section and intensity. However, the\npredicted pump-probe decay times are relatively insensitive\nto the latter two parameters as long as full saturation is\nachieved. The scattering off-resonance can have contribu-\ntions from mechanisms other than LO phonon scattering\nsuch as acoustic phonon emission, particularly for narrower\nlinewidths, and this requires further investigation.\nOur results and calculation for InAs\/AlSb show lifetimes\nat resonance with Eq. ~1! that are consistent with those found\nFIG. 3. Electron-LO phonon scattering probability vs field cal-\nculated for an InAs\/AlSb quantum well with a mobility m\n5262 000 cm2\/V s. The spin splitting has not been resolved here.\nThe rates shown are for empty Landau levels, i.e., occupation ef-\nfects, etc. are included later in the calculation via Eq. ~2!. Only\nselected transitions are shown, those near to the fill factors relevant\nfor our sample.previously in InAs\/GaSb,15,16 where lifetimes on resonance\nwere subpicosecond. However, in these earlier experiments\nthe pump-probe technique was not available ~giving consid-\nerable systematic uncertainty!, and the sample used had a\nmuch lower mobility ~40 000 cm2\/V s! and broader linewidth\nas compared with the present work. Under these circum-\nstances it was not possible to observe the strong phonon\nbottleneck effect or accurately measure the lifetime away\nfrom the phonon resonances as reported here. Furthermore,\nmeasurements at the higher temperatures were not attempted.\nThe values for the lifetimes away from the phonon reso-\nnances are consistent with previous measurements of inter-\nLandau level relaxation in GaAs heterostructures. As men-\ntioned above, a scattering rate proportional to carrier density\n~i.e., t}1\/n) was found, and therefore associated with\nelectron-electron scattering.17 The very long lifetimes of\naround 1 ns, when extrapolated to our higher density would\nlead to much shorter times. However, our data agree very\nwell with a model with only one process that affects the\nenergy of the electron system, the LO phonon emission ~and\nabsorption!. We implicitly assume a certain degree of energy\nredistribution processes such as electron-electron and ionized\nimpurity scattering, which broaden the levels. The relaxation\nproceeds via the latter two to the phonon energy, followed by\nphonon emission. Off resonance, the number of states in the\nwings of the levels overlapping with the phonon energy is\nsmall giving a lower net LO phonon rate. This would be\nparticularly true in higher mobility samples, in which case it\nmay be possible to observe other processes, such as acoustic\nphonon scattering, and at energies larger than \\vLO mul-\ntiphonon events would be possible.\nBy analogy with the present 0D case, it is known that\nintersubband relaxation in quantum wells is strongly depen-\ndent on the subband separation, and theoretical models of 2D\nintersubband relaxation have shown enhanced cooling where\nthe quantum well subband separation energy equals the LO\nphonon energy.23 The existence of a bottleneck in the cool-\ning of carriers between subbands in wide quantum wells\nwhen the subband separation is smaller than the LO phonon\nenergy has been observed previously.24 Lifetimes of the or-\nder of 50 ps due to acoustic phonon emission were found at\nlow temperatures. In this system ~with zero magnetic field!\nthere are always states that exist at the phonon energy but\naway from the subband minimum, and thus the bottleneck\nmay be overcome by increasing the temperature above some\nactivation threshold, 35 K in that case. In the present 0D\nsystem, raising the temperature does not remove the bottle-\nneck effect even up to 80 K.\nOur model also explains the temperature dependence of\nour results. Saturation occurs at a fixed electron distribution\nthat depends only on the level structure and optical matrix\nelements, i.e., is independent of the relaxation process or of\nlattice temperature. This gives a paradoxical result that when\nthe temperature is increased, the cooling lifetime increases,\nsince our initial ~saturated! excited electron distribution is\nthen less different from equilibrium.16 At the highest tem-\nperatures investigated here, kBT;\\vLO\/5 and the population\nof LO phonons is starting to become important, and we have\nindeed observed a slight rise in lifetime. However, as the\ntemperature is increased further, increased broadening would\nenhance the scattering off-resonance thus reversing this\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\nR7820 PRB 59B. N. MURDIN et al.trend. In our case no changes in the cyclotron linewidth or\nthe mobility up to 80 K occur, but above this point the mo-\nbility starts to drop (m520 000 cm\/V s at 300 K!. Some\ninterband photoluminescence ~PL! experiments have also\nshown lifetimes decreasing with temperature,5 possibly due\nto additional processes not present in our quasi dots such as\nAuger involving holes or barrier electrons.\nIn summary, we have measured the relaxation lifetime of\ncarriers in a quasi quantum dot resulting from a two-\ndimensional electron gas in a magnetic field. The measure-\nments have been made both such that the level separation\nequals the phonon energy and away from this condition. A\nbottleneck exists in LO-phonon cooling of carriers away\nfrom the resonance, which is independent of temperature be-\ntween 4 and 80 K.\nThe fact that the LO phonon cooling is significantly\nquenched away from the resonant phonon scattering condi-\ntion, may have important consequences for quantum dot de-\nvices based on either inter- or intraband optical transitions,\nsince it confirms the existence of the LO-phonon bottleneck\nbetween the lowest dot states, even at the higher tempera-\ntures. For comparison with spatial confinement, the typical\ndot size with level separation corresponding to the funda-\nmental resonance at 29.5 meV is of the order of 50 nm. On\nthe other hand, the lifetimes found here under bottleneckconditions ~;50 ps! may not be deleterious since they are\nsimilar to the lifetimes predicted to be necessary for dot laser\noperation.11 In any case, several mechanisms have been pro-\nposed that efficiently bypass the phonon bottleneck in the\nelectron cooling in real dots. In particular, under high energy\ninterband excitation electron-hole scattering may dominate,\nbut also scattering with continuum electrons, cascading\nthrough nonradiating excitonic states, tunneling between ad-\njacent dots and confined phonons have been suggested ~see,\nfor example Refs. 7\u201310!. The present determination of the\nscattering rate between the lowest states in a doped quasi\nquantum dot structure ~without the complication of holes!\nshould help in the quantitative evaluation of these fundamen-\ntal processes.\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. A. van der Meer and the\nFELIX staff for skillful technical assistance.
