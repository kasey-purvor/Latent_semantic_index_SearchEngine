Introduction22\n Micro-injection moulding (\u03bcIM) is a key technology in mass-producing micro-scaled components. 23\nHigh-volume production, replication fidelity and high precision are some of the features that promote the use of24\n\u03bcIM for applications such as medical diagnostics and chemical analysis. 25\n Quality parameters in \u03bcIM are usually associated with the ability to completely fill the micro-size 26\ncavities in the mould cavity during processing.

However, micro-manufacturing processes such as \u03bcIM 33\nmay often require a number of quality criteria to be met simultaneously. These could be, for example, a specific34\nfeature dimension and a maximum acceptable variability in part mass. In such cases, an optimisation process35\nwould be required to attempt to meet both requirements within the \u201cprocess window\u201d that was available.36\nProcess variability, in this context, refers to variations that occur normally in industrial processes. Such37\nvariations are usually attributed to changes in process parameters (factors), i.e. those which can be varied in a38\ncontrolled manner, and\/or changes that result from other causes, which have not been or cannot be controlled. In39\nexperimental terms, the former variations are usually referred to as the signal [17], or systematic variability40\n[18], which is the change of response that the experimenter is seeking to detect. The latter is usually41\nreferred to as the noise, scatter or unsystematic variability of the response that occurs during standard operation42\nconditions.43\nThis paper presents an example of a micro-injection moulded part, where DOE was used to investigate44\nthe effect of processing parameters on two quality criteria, namely complete mould filling, as represented by part45\nmass and variability in part mass in replicated experiments. A desirability function approach was then used to46\nattempt to optimise process conditions for both responses.47\n2. Experiments48\n2.1 Overview of statistical methodology49\nThe aspect of variability that was investigated in this paper was that of replicability. Replication, in this50\ncontext, is the process of running experimental trials in a random order, such that resetting is done after each51\nexperimental trial [17,19]. Hence, investigating variability using DOE requires that each set of DOE experiments52\nHolding pressure, filling flow\nrate and mould temperature.\nDOE design: Taguchi\northogonal design L18 (21 x 37).\nFilled volume\nfraction of\nmicrofilters\nCOC Flow rate found to be the most\nimportant processing parameter\n[14]\nMelt temp., mould temp.,\ninjection pressure, holding\npressure, ejection temp. and\ninjection speed.\nDOE design: Taguchi\northogonal design L18 (37).\nTensile strength\nof weld lines.\nPP High melt temperatures decrease weld\nline strength.

This is in contrast with repetition, which is the process of53\nrunning experimental trials under the same combination of machine parameters during a single machine run [17].54\nDOE assumes that responses follow a normal probability distribution, which is not the case for standard55\ndeviation. Hence, variability was represented here using the natural logarithm of the standard deviation, ln (SD),56\nwhich transforms the data closer to a normal distribution [17,20].57\nTo improve both replicability and part quality a statistical tool was required to optimise factors for58\nmultiple responses [20,21]. Here, desirability functions were used to predict a combination of processing59\nparameters that fulfilled the two requirements. Each response yi is individually converted into a desirability60\nfunction di that ranges between 0 and 1, where di=1 represents being at the target and di=0 lies outside the target61\nrange. The factors are calculated to maximise the overall desirability, D, where D = (d1.d2. ... .dm)1\/m, and m is the62\nnumber of responses.63\nObjectives of the desirability functions can be either to meet a target within specified range, to64\nminimize or to maximize responses. In this paper, the target T was to produce parts within a specific mass range65\nand to minimize variability in part mass. The individual functions for meeting a target and minimising the66\nresponse are represented in Equations (1) and (2), respectively.67\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0a3\uf0a3\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf0a3\uf0a3\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nUy\nUyT\nTU\nyU\nTyL\nLT\nLy\nLy\nd r\nr\n\uf066\n\uf070\n0\n0\n2\n1\n1\n(1)68\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ee\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ef\n\uf0ed\n\uf0ec\n\uf0a3\uf0a3\uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6\n\uf02d\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nUy\nUyT\nTU\nyU\nTy\nd\nr\n\uf066\n\uf070\n0\n1\n2 (2)69\nIn both equations U and L are the upper and lower limits, respectively, and r-values are the function70\nweight (liner or non-liner), which in this case are all set to be equal to 1.71\nFor Equation (1) the target, upper and lower values were selected based on the filling quality of the72\nproduced samples. Briefly, after each set of experiments, samples of the 16 runs were inspected under the73\nmicroscope to check their filling quality. The completely filled parts were weighed and their average mass was74\ncalculated and set as the \u201ctarget\u201d mass for the desirability function. The filled samples that had the smallest and75\nthe largest masses were also identified, and their weights were selected as the lower and upper limits,76\nrespectively.77\nA similar approach was followed for Equation (2), except that no lower limit existed, since the purpose78\nof the function was to minimise the response (variability).79\n2.2 Component geometry80\nThe component chosen for this study was a Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) assembly element of a81\nmicrofluidic device for use in medical diagnostics. As illustrated in Figure 1, the element is disc-shaped with a82\ndiameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.83\n84\n85\nFig 1 A CAD drawing of the test element.86\n87\nMore details about the manufacturing process-chain and device design are available in the literature88\n[22,23]. The component possessed several micro-scale geometries, including a central, conically shaped through-89\nhole that was 100 um to 150 \u03bcm in diameter, and a disk impression on the component surface, which had a depth 90\nof 50 \u03bcm. Figure 2 shows SEM micrographs of the mould insert and an example of a replicated PMMA part 91\nfrom a fully-filled moulding.92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\nFig 2 SEM micrographs of (a) mould insert and (b) replicated PMMA part.99\n100\n2.3 Equipment and process parameters:101\nFive process parameters (factors) were investigated: Polymer-melt temperature (Tp), mould temperature102\n(Tm), holding pressure (Ph), Injection velocity (Vi) and cooling time (tc).103\nThe micro moulding machine used was a Battenfeld Microsystems 50. The PMMA material was VS-104\nUVT from Altuglas\u00ae. This particular grade was selected for its ease of flow (MFI = 24 g\/10 min) and its optical105\ntransparency (light transmittance 92%). The Vicat softening temperature of the material is 85\u00b0C. The minimum106\nmelt and mould temperatures recommended by the manufacturer were 195\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C, respectively. A sensitive107\nweighing scale with a readability of 0.01 mg was used to weigh the parts. Data analysis and optimization was108\nconducted with Minitab\u00ae 15 [24].109\na\n500 \u03bcm \nb\n500 \u03bcm \n2.4 Experimental design and procedure110\nA two-level, half-factorial (25-1) design was used to test the effect of process parameters on the two111\nselected responses. The resolution-V design decreases the number of required experiments to half of that of a112\nfull-factorial one (16 runs per experiment instead of 32). In addition, in this particular design main effects are not113\nconfounded with second-order interactions, and second-order interactions are not confounded with each other.114\nThis allowed for fewer experimental runs without compromising the accuracy of the results.115\nTable 2 presents the levels of the five factors tested in the experimental design.116\n117\nMetering\nVolume\n[mm3]\nTp [\u00b0C] Tm [\u00b0C] Vi [mm\/s] Ph [MPa] tc [s]\nLow\nlevel\n(-)\nHigh\nlevel\n(+)\nLow\nlevel\n(-)\nHigh\nlevel\n(+)\nLow\nlevel\n(-)\nHigh\nlevel\n(+)\nLow\nlevel\n(-)\nHigh\nlevel\n(+)\nLow\nlevel\n(-)\nHigh\nlevel\n(+)\n178 230 250 72 80 200 300 10 30 4 7\nTable 2.

The experiments were performed120\nfollowing a randomised order of the runs using a built-in randomisation function in Minitab. For each run, the121\nmachine was left to finish 50 continuous cycles (repeats) and then 10 parts were collected for inspection. This122\nwas done to ensure that the process reached stability before sample collection. The experimentation setup shown123\nin Table 3 was replicated three times in randomised run sequences.124\n125\nStandard\nOrder Tp [\u00b0C] Tm [\u00b0C] Ph [MPa] Vi [mm\/s] tc [s]\n1 - - - - +\n2 + - - - -\n3 - + - - -\n4 + + - - +\n5 - - + - -\n6 + - + - +\n7 - + + - +\n8 + + + - -\n9 - - - + -\n10 + - - + +\n11 - + - + +\n12 + + - + -\n13 - - + + +\n14 + - + + -\n15 - + + + -\n16 + + + + +\nTable 3. A half-factorial, two level 16-run (25-1) experimentation design.126\n127\nTwo outputs were evaluated: filling quality and process variability. The former response was128\nrepresented by the average mass calculated from the three replicates (W), where producing a part that has a mass129\nwithin a specific tolerance indicates that it is completely filled. Inspecting the replicated parts under the130\nmicroscope showed that completely filled parts had average mass of 88.6 mg within a range of approximately131\n\u00b10.5%. The latter response was represented by ln (SD), calculated from the standard deviation of the three132\nreplicates.133\nAs outlined above, desirability functions were used to optimise factors for part mass and variability.134\nThe filled part mass tolerance was used to pre-set the conditions used in the desirability function to a target mass135\nof 88.6 mg, a lower limit of 88.4 mg and an upper limit of 89 mg, based on the 0.5 percentage point limits. The136\ntarget for process variability was set to minimise the value of ln (SD), such that its maximum value would not137\nexceed -1.9, corresponding to SD of 0.15. This set the upper limit not to exceed the average of the SD found138\nfrom the previous 16 runs of the DOE.139\nTable 4 presents the combination of factors calculated from Equations 1 and 2 to meet both these140\nrequirements. The responses show the expected values for both mass and variability. The values of d1 and d2141\nrepresent the individual desirabilities of each response from Equations (1) and (2). D represents the combined142\ndesirability, which is a measure of how the factors combination recommended by the function was able to meet143\nboth response requirements.144\n145\nFactors\nMelt T [\u00b0C] 250\nMould T [\u00b0C] 80\nHold [MPa] 30\nInj.

Discussion192\nThe plots in Figure 4 showed that three influential parameters affect the magnitude of the part mass,193\nnamely holding pressure followed by melt temperature and injection velocity. No significant interactions were194\ndetected195\nConcerning part-mass variability, Figure 5 indicated that a single experimental factor was a significant196\nsource of mass variation in replicated parts, in this case the injection velocity. Hence, the main significant factor197\nthat affected the mass magnitude (holding pressure) was not the same as the one that affected mass variation198\n(injection velocity).199\nConcerning sample magnitude, the effect of holding pressure on part mass was expected, since200\nincreasing the holding pressure allowed for more material to fill the mould cavity before complete freezing and,201\nhence, increasing its mass. The effect of holding pressure on quality filling in Micro-injection moulding was also202\nevident in earlier experiments involving different geometries and polymers [3,4,6]. Increasing melt temperature203\nalso affects the filling of the mould cavity, because the viscosity of the polymeric melt decreases with increasing204\nits temperature allowing for better filling of micro-scaled features. This effect of melt temperature also agrees205\nwith earlier experiments involving filling microstructures by micro-injection moulding [7,9].206\nConcerning mass variability, increased injection velocity was shown to be a source of decreased207\nvariance in the obtained data. This may lie in the fact that increasing velocity leads to an increase in shear rate,208\nwhich in turn decreases the viscosity of the polymer and allows for better flow inside the mould cavity. This209\nimproved flow would result in consistent filling performance from one cycle to another. Previous experiments210\nshowed that increasing the injection velocity results in better mould cavity filling for micro-injection moulding211\n[6-9].212\nFigure 5a indicated that increasing injection velocity, the identified significant effect, leads to a213\ndecrease in ln (SD), i.e. a decrease in process variation. On the other hand, Figure 4a showed that increasing214\ninjection velocity led to a decrease in part mass. This indicates that if a combination of factors is to be found to215\nfulfil both response requirements, i.e. a decrease in variability and an increase in part mass, a compromise would216\nbe necessary for the value of injection velocity.217\nThe values shown in Table 4 indicate how the desirability function took into consideration the trends218\ndiscussed above. The holding pressure and melt temperature were set to their upper limits to satisfy the part-219\nmass requirement. For the injection velocity, the selected value was at a point closer to the upper limit (to satisfy220\nvariability requirement) but not at the upper limit in order not to violate the velocity requirement for part mass.221\nThis compromise in injection velocity affected the predicted responses, as shown in Table 4. The222\npredicted part mass was 88.5 which was slightly lower than the target mass of 88.6 but still within the pre-set223\ntolerance of \u00b10.4 mg. The predicted ln (SD) was -2.0 (corresponding to SD of 0.14) which was lower than the224\nupper limit set to -1.9.225\nSince a compromise had to be made between two responses, the individual desirability d1 and d2 of226\nmass and mass-variability, respectively, are less than 1. The overall desirability, D, is therefore calculated to be227\n0.83.228\nTable 6 presents the results of the validation experiments, where average mass was 88.9 mg and SD was229\nshown to be 0.10. Hence, the average part mass was higher than predicted by approximately 0.3%, although it230\nstill lay within the pre-set tolerance of \u00b10.4 mg, whereas the standard deviation obtained was lower than231\npredicted by the desirability function. Comparing the obtained SD of 0.1 to the original run standard deviations232\nlisted in Table 5 shows that it was possible to achieve variability, when optimising for both mass magnitude and233\nmass variability, that fell within the lowest quarter of the original experimental data.234\nThe presented experiment showed that designed experiments could be used to optimise process235\nconditions for multiple quality criteria. This is particularly important for industrial environments where quality236\nrequirements involve a number of criteria to be met simultaneously. In addition, process variability resulting237\nfrom process replication was discussed. This is also an important issue in industrial environments, where238\nchanging in, e.g. processing shifts, might affect the consistency of the produced parts. The presented statistical239\ntechnique was implemented to detect the source of such variability, if any, and minimise it.240\nOn the other hand, the methodology used has some limitations that need to be taken into consideration241\nwhen applied. Firstly, the 2-level experimental design assumed the linearity of the factors with respect to the242\nresponses. This could not be verified until further experiments involving, for example, 3-level designs could be243\ndone, which might require extra time and resources. Secondly, the accuracy of the obtained results depended on244\nthe resolution of the selected experimentation design. In the presented case, a fractional factorial design was245\nadequate for the selected responses. In other applications, were more strict measurements and tolerances are246\nrequired, a higher resolution design might be required. Finally, it should be noted that the desirability function247\nsuggests optimised process conditions within the initially specified upper and lower levels of the tested factors.248\nInvestigating process performance outside these limits would require extending the experimentation \u201cwindow\u201d249\nfor the required factors beyond the initial values.250\nFuture work might focus on using the same technique for more than two responses, including extra251\nresponses, such as feature dimensions. In addition, more factors would be included in the experimentation design252\nto investigate other sources of process variability.253\n254\n5. Conclusion255\nThis paper aimed at presenting a methodology for optimising process conditions for multiple quality256\ncriteria in \u03bcIM. Five processing parameters were investigated for their effect on part mass and mass variation. It 257\nwas found that holding pressure followed by melt temperature and velocity were significant for part mass, whilst258\ninjection velocity alone was significant for mass variation. Hence the main significant effect differed between259\npart mass and mass variation. Further, injection velocity was found to be a parameter of a different effect on the260\ntwo responses, its effect proportional to mass variation but inversely related to part mass. Hence, for some261\nmicro-moulded components, attempting process optimization for part quality alone may lead to an unintended262\nconsequence of increases in mass variation.263\nDesirability functions were used to find a combination of factors to meet a specific mass requirement264\nand to minimise variability simultaneously. The function produced a set of values that took into consideration265\nthe contradicting effect of injection velocity on both criteria. The suggested conditions were tested, where the266\naverage mass deviated by only 0.3% and the variability was better than what was predicted by the functions.267\nBoth responses were within the pre-set requirements and the method was shown to be useful in optimising268\nmultiple quality criteria.269\nReferences270\n[1] M\u00f6nkk\u00f6nen K, Hietala J, P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen P, P\u00e4\u00e4kk\u00f6nen EJ, Kaikuranta T, Pakkanen TT and J\u00e4\u00e4skel\u00e4inen T271\n(2002) Replication of sub-micron features using amorphous thermoplastics.
