J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 2\nINTRODUCTION \n \nThe high velocity impact response of CFRP materials is of particular interest to \naircraft manufacturers who are concerned with attack from fragmenting munitions. These \nfragmenting munitions can accelerate a dispersion of metallic projectiles to velocities of \nc. 2000 m\/s by means of a detonating high explosive charge. Consequently there is a need \nto understand the energy absorption and damage mechanisms that occur when such \nprojectiles strike aircraft-grade CFRP panels. Very little work has been done on \nexamining the impact response of carbon fibre composite laminates at impact velocities \nabove 500 m\/s. This is not surprising due to their very low ballistic performance [1] and \napart from the impact and penetration by fragmenting munitions, there is little application \nrelevant to this velocity regime. There has been however interest in velocities in excess of \n2000 m\/s due to the application of these structures to space vehicles [2,3]. \nCantwell and Morton [1] have shown that the response of a CFRP panel to these \ntwo very different loading regimes was quite different. On the one hand, for low velocity \nimpact, the size and shape of the panel determined its energy absorbing capability. \nWhereas on the other hand, high velocity projectiles induced a localised response in the \ntarget that did not depend on the areal size of the target. \nHazell et al. [4] have previously shown that below an impact energy of 500 J, the \nenergy absorbed by 3 mm and 6 mm plates dropped off and appeared to approach an \nasymptotic level. For a 6-mm thick CFRP panel, the level of damage also appeared to \ndrop off and approached a constant level whereas with the 3 mm target the level of \ndamage appeared to be constant regardless of the impact energy. The observed constant \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 3\nlevel of damage in the 3 mm panel was probably due to the fact that the level of damage \nhad already plateaud before the minimum impact velocity used in these experimental \ntrials was reached. Indeed, Tanabe et al. [5] have shown that the drop-off in areal damage \noccurred at an impact energy of 20 J for 4 and 5-mm diameter spheres impacting c. 2-mm \nthick CFRP panels. This was at a much lower impact energy than was tested in [4]. \nTanabe and Aoki [6] have studied the impact response of a variety of carbon-\nfibre-based laminates at velocities between 150-1300 m\/s. In their work, they employed \nembedded PVDF stress gauges and constantan strain gauges to assess the stress and strain \nresponse of the materials when subjected to impact and penetration. They found that the \nmaximum stress generated in the CFRPs depended on the nature of the reinforcing fibres. \nFurther, they noted that above a critical measured stress, the fracture of the CFRP was \n\u201cfluid-like\u201d in that comminution of the material had occurred. \nFujii et al. [7] impacted several kinds of CFRP laminate specimens consisting of \ndifferent carbon fibres, interlaminate sequences, configurations and thicknesses. They \nalso observed, what they described as a \u201cfluid-like\u201d failure of the laminate. Notably, they \nshowed that there was no clear difference in the energy absorbing abilities between cross-\nply specimens and specimens consisting of a five-harness woven cloth. They also showed \nthat the delamination width depended on impact energy. \nHammond et al. [8] studied the response of relatively thin (1.8-2.5 mm) CFRP \npanels of different symmetrical lay-ups struck by a 12.7 mm steel projectile that had an \naverage velocity of 474 m\/s. Here they showed that microstructural damage mechanisms \nwere similar regardless of lay-up with the major difference being the volume over which \nthe damage was spread. \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 4\nRecently Lopez-Puente et al. [9] have presented work on the normal and oblique \npenetration of CFRP laminates using both a gas gun and the finite element commercial \ncode ABAQUS\/Explicit. They showed that the maximum damage inflicted by the \nprojectile at the ballistic limit was produced at normal incidence. Furthermore, below the \nballistic limit, the extent of damage for normal impact was larger than that for the oblique \nimpact. However, the extent of damage at higher velocities appeared to be greater for \noblique impacts. Lopez-Puente et al. [10] have also studied the effect of low temperature \non the impact response of these materials. They showed that quasi-isotropic tape \nlaminates were less effective against impact than woven laminates due to the different \nflexural behaviour of the plies. They also showed that temperature has no effect on \ndamage extension and consequently for aerospace applications, the damage extension \ncould be determined by impact tests at room temperature. \nIn this study, we have examined the response of a single thickness of woven \nCFRP to impact and penetration by a fully annealed stainless steel sphere between the \nvelocity regime of 141 m\/s and 1875 m\/s. The objective of this study was to interrogate \nthe behaviour of the CFRP laminate when subjected to impact in this velocity regime and \nto measure the energy dissipated by the laminate when completely penetrated. This work \nis part of a wider study on the dynamic behaviour of woven CFRP laminates. \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 5\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY \n \nMaterials used \n \nThe materials chosen for this study were woven CFRP laminates that were \nmanufactured using the resin transfer moulding (RTM) method and supplied by Short \nBrothers plc, Belfast. These laminates were chosen because they are commonly used in \nthe aerospace industry.  All individual panels were manufactured with Hexcel G0926 \nCarbon Fabric with a 5 harness satin weave. The resin used was a Hexcel RTM6 epoxy \nsystem cured for 1 hour 40 minutes at 180 \u00b0C and at a pressure of 100 psi. The shock \nbehaviour of this particular epoxy resin system has previously been reported in [11]. The \nCFRP panel was 6 mm thick and made from 16 plies with the lay-up in sequence from \nimpact face to rear face: 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \u00b1 45, 0\/90, 0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, \n0\/90, \u00b145, 0\/90, \u00b1 45, 0\/90. The effect of the asymmetrical layup on ballistic performance \nhas previously been reported in [4] and has been shown to be negligible. The density of \nthe CFRP material, measured using a Micrometrics AccuPyc 1330 gas pycnometer, was \n1.512 g\/cc \u00b1 0.001 g\/cc. The dynamic behaviour of this type of laminate subjected to \nflyer-plate testing has been reported both by Millett et al. [12] and ourselves [13]. The \nmass fraction of the reinforcement was measured using the acid digestion method \naccording to ASTM D 3171-6, Procedure B. [14] and was found to be 69.7\u00b11.0%. \n \n \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 6\nImpact testing \n \nThe projectile used was a fully annealed stainless steel sphere (\u220511.97 mm \u00b1 0.01 \nmm; mass = 7.165 g \u00b1 0.001 g; VHN = 127). The balls (AISI type 304) were fully \nannealed in air at 1050\u00b0C to provide equiaxed austenite grains and consequently isotropic \nbehavior. The yield strength of this steel at 21\u00b0C is 450 MPa with an ultimate tensile \nstrength of 675 MPa [15]. The projectile was fired from ELVIS, a single stage \u220522-mm \ngas-gun for velocities of less than 400 m\/s. To achieve the higher velocities a 30 mm \nsingle stage gas gun and a 30 mm RARDEN cannon were employed. With the 30-mm \ngas gun, a baffle plate was employed behind the sabot stripper to remove any sabot debris \nthat inadvertently made its way through the sabot stripper behind the projectile. Target \nspecimens were cut from supplied material into a minimum dimension of 150 mm \u00d7 150 \nmm squares and secured at the top and bottom of the target. \nImpact velocity was measured by either using foil gauges or high speed video \ncamera; the residual velocity of the projectile was measured using the camera. The \nenergy transferred to the panel was assessed by measuring the impact velocity and the \nresidual velocity of the projectile to an accuracy of <1 %. Two high speed video cameras \nwere used:  a Phantom 7 running at 18,000 pictures-per-second with an exposure time of \n2 \u03bcs and a Photron Ultima 512 running at 16,000 pictures-per-second with an exposure \ntime of 3 \u03bcs. The energy transferred to the target (Et) was calculated from  \n \n( )22\n2\n1\nript vvmE \u2212=        (1) \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 7\n \nwhere mp is the mass of the projectile, and vi and vr are the impact and residual velocities. \nConsequently, the percentage change in kinetic energy (\u0394Ef) was calculated using \n \n100\u00d7=\u0394\ni\nt\nf E\nEE        (2) \n \nwhere Ei is the kinetic energy of the projectile prior to impact. \nParallax was taken into account by knowing the distances from the camera lens to \nthe axis of penetration and from the axis of penetration to fiduciary markers. Debris that \nwas ejected from the targets was recovered using multiple layers of cotton cloth. The \nexperimental set-up for the high velocity shots using the 30-mm single-stage gas-gun is \nshown below in Figure 1. \n \nFigure 1: Experimental set-up for the high velocity shots (30-mm single-stage gas gun). \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 8\nThe extent of damage in the perforated composites was assessed by doing C-scans \nand by sectioning the CFRP panel to analyse the extent of through-thickness damage; \nmicroscopy was also carried out on the ejecta using a LEO 435VP scanning electron \nmicroscope. The C-scans were carried out using a glass reflector technique with a 5MHz, \n50mm crystal focus transducer. The scans were carried out by Midas NDT Systems Ltd. \nusing a 1 mm grid and a scan speed of 100 mm\/s. \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 9\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nChange in energy \n \nThe percentage change in the kinetic energy (KE) for the 6 mm targets is shown \nbelow in Figure 2. We have also included data that was reported in reference [4] using an \nidentical experimental set-up.  \n \nFigure 2: Percentage change in KE due to the perforation of the CFRP laminates. \n \nThere are a few things to note here. \nFirstly, we have reduced the impact energy from the lowest result reported in [4] \nto 71 J (141 m\/s). This resulted in the projectile being stopped whereas with an impact \nenergy of 115 J (179 m\/s) the target was perforated. Consequently, the ballistic limit for \nthis 6-mm thick woven CFRP laminate is between 141 m\/s and 179 m\/s for the type of \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 10\nprojectile used in this study and consequently the perforation threshold energy is in-\nbetween 71 J and 115 J.  \nSecondly, for impact energies up to 1000 J the percentage of kinetic energy \nabsorbed rapidly reduces with increasing kinetic energy of the projectile. This is due, in \npart, to the change in penetration mechanisms of the projectile from that of causing \npetalling where the fibre tows are loaded in tension, to causing compression \/ shear \nfailure in the target [4]. For the normal incidence targets it was evident that at lower \nvelocities the failure is dominated by petalling whereas at higher velocities the failure of \nthe target is dominated by plug formation.  \nThirdly, it is clear that over the velocity range of interest in this research, the \npercentage of KE absorbed is almost constant above an impact energy of around 2000 J.  \n \nPerforation mechanisms \n \nIncreasing the energy of impact from 71 J to 177 J resulted in perforation of the \ncomposite target. Figure 3 shows the impact, penetration and perforation of a CFRP panel \nthat has been struck by the projectile with an impact energy of 177 J. At this level of \nimpact energy, the perforation was dominated by the petalling of the rear surface plies. \nDuring the initial stages of penetration, bulging was evident and eventually tensile failure \nensued and the projectile was able to perforate. The petals that were formed were pushed \naside by the projectile; some of the rear surface plies were ejected during penetration. \nEventually, the penetration channel formed by the projectile was closed as the remaining \nInt.

Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 11\npetals relaxed resulting in a penetration channel that was less than 12 mm in diameter \n(the diameter of the steel sphere). \n \nFigure 3: Penetration of the CFRP laminate panel; impact energy = 177 J (223 m\/s). Filmed at 18,000 \nframes-per-second with an exposure of 2 \u00b5s per frame. \n \nIncreasing the impact energy to 659 J resulted in a different target response. Post \nmortem interrogation of the target revealed that a clear penetration channel had been \nformed that was similar in diameter to that of the steel projectile (c. 12 mm). \nFurthermore, a plug of CFRP was soft captured by layers of cotton rags located behind \nthe target. Previous work presented in [4], has shown that as the impact energy was \nincreased, the perforation mechanism in these types of laminates changed from that \nwhich was dominated by petalling to a mechanism that was dominated by a conically-\nshaped plug-formation. Indeed, other researchers have also observed plug formation \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 12\nduring the penetration of CFRP materials. Li and Sun [16] noted plug formation in thin \nCFRP laminates that had been struck by a blunt-ended projectile at relatively low \nvelocities (<100 m\/s). Cantwell and Morton [17] have previously shown that during the \nperforation of a thin CFRP material, a frustum\u2013shaped fracture zone is formed. This \nobservation is consistent with the conically shaped plugs that we soft-captured. \nInterestingly, we recovered plugs up to and including impact energies of 1983 J. \nA recovered plug from an impact at 1983 J is shown below in Figure 4. The \nsurfaces seen in this micrograph correspond to the fracture surfaces of the different plies \nin the composite target. \n \nFigure 4: Micrograph of a recovered plug; impact energy = 1983 J (744 m\/s). \n \nThe analysis of the SEM micrograph of the recovered plug in Figure 4 showed \nthat the fibre tows on the top surfaces of the recovered plug appeared to have undergone a \nshear type failure which is characterised by the relatively clean fracture of the fibre tows. \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 13\nThese are highlighted by the arrows. On the other hand, the rear surface tows of the plug \nappeared to have considerably more jagged failure surfaces. Figure 5 shows a close up of \none such failure surface (indicated by the arrow) on a tow towards the rear of a plug \nrecovered from a target that was impacted with an energy of 662 J (430 m\/s). The rear \ntows appeared to have been subjected to fibre pull out and is characteristic of tensile type \nof failure observed by Hatta et al. [18] under quasi-static loading conditions. Both the \ncompressive shear failure and tensile failure in plug formation have been observed \npreviously by Hazell et al. [4]. Here it was deduced that the simultaneous shear failure of \nthe front tows with tensile failure of the rear tows was not possible unless extensive \ndishing had occurred in the target.   \n \nFigure 5: Micrograph of tensile failure of fibre tows in a plug recovered from the laminate impacted \nat 662 J (430 m\/s). \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 14\nOn all plugs recovered, it was notable that matrix failure had occurred. At the top \nof the plug where the projectile was in contact with the CFRP laminate, the micrographs \nrevealed that the fibre had been exposed.  Figure 6 shows an example of exposed fibres \non the plug recovered from an impact at 1983 J (744 m\/s). The left hand micrograph \nshows that the fibres have been readily exposed and are clearly defined. Whereas the \nright hand micrograph shows the fibres close to a tow failure; the visible debris is \nparticulated RTM6 epoxy resin.  Notably, this resin is strong yet brittle when fully cured \n(strain-to-failure = 3.4% [19]) and consequently would be susceptible to brittle failure \nduring projectile penetration.  \n \nFigure 6: Micrographs of a plug recovered from the impact at 1983 J (744 m\/s) showing the exposure \nof the fibre tows due to failure of the matrix. \n \nIncreasing the impact energy beyond 1983 J appeared to reveal a different \nresponse in the target in this experimental programme. We should point out that this \nenergy level is unlikely to be a clearly defined transition from one response to another but \nrather an energy level around which a gradual change in target response is expected. \nIncreasing the impact energies above 1983 J resulted in no plug being captured in the \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 15\ncotton rags or observed in the high speed video footage. Furthermore, above this impact \nenergy, it was apparent that little-to-no drop-off in percentage change in kinetic energy \nwas observed with increasing impact energy (see Figure 2).  \nFigure 7 shows the sequence of events as the projectile impacts, penetrates and \nperforates a target; the impact energy was 5150 J (1199 m\/s). As the projectile contacts \nthe CFRP material, light is emitted (frame B). At 125 \u03bcs a plume of particulated CFRP \nmaterial has been formed, the forward front of which precedes the projectile. Material is \nejected backwards from the impact surface. At 187.5 \u03bcs the projectile starts to emerge \nfrom the cloud of dust. The material ejected from the impact surface of the panel appears \nto be moving at a lower velocity than the material ejected from the rear surface. At 250 \n\u03bcs (frame E) the projectile is clearly defined. The large fragments formed maintain a \nvelocity similar to the projectile (c. 1062 m\/s) whereas the large volume of lighter \nparticles are slowed. By 312.5 \u03bcs (frame F) the lighter particles are moving with an \naverage linear velocity of 200 m\/s. \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 16\n \nFigure 7: High speed video images taken at 16,000 frames-per-second showing the perforation of a 6-\nmm CFRP laminate; impact energy = 5150 J (1199 m\/s). \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 17\n \nThe high speed video footage revealed that there was considerable particulation of the \nCFRP laminate; no plug was captured in the soft rags located behind the target or \nobserved in the video footage. The fact that the CFRP laminate has been broken down \ninto much smaller fragments than was observed at the lower velocity lends weight to the \nview that the resin is extensively damaged and particulated as the impact energy is \nincreased. \n \nDamage assessment \n  \nThe targets were C-scanned to examine the extent of the internal damage to the \npanels. An image analyzer program was used to measure the damage zone when the \nsignal attenuation was greater than 5dB. For the targets impacted at a velocity close to the \nballistic limit, the cavity had partially closed therefore giving a misleading representation \nof the size of the penetration channel. Consequently, the results presented in Figure 8 \ninclude the hole size and represent the total area of damage.  It was noted that in the \nmajority of the normal incidence impact cases the area of delamination was mostly \ncircular. However, on a number of occasions, the composite was damaged by small \namounts of low density sabot debris leading to non-circular pattern of damage. In these \ncases, an estimate of the damage caused by the sabot debris was calculated by using a \ncircular template \u23af the diameter of which contacted the periphery of the damage at least \non two points. In these cases, the total damage (including sabot impact damage) is \nhighlighted by the error bar. Furthermore, for the two samples that were subjected to the \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 18\nhighest impact velocities, reliable C-scan data were unavailable. Consequently, the \ndamage was estimated from the micrographs of polished sections assuming a circular \narea of damage (see Figure 9).   \n \nFigure 8: Damage area measured by C-scan for each of the impacted targets. \n \nFrom Figure 8, the level of damage is constant between an impact energy of c. \n500 J and 5000 J despite the energy dissipated by the CFRP laminate increasing (see \nFigure 2). This implies that the increase in the energy dissipated by the CFRP laminate is \nnot related to the degree of damage as measured by the C-scan.  We should point out that \nthe data point at the impact test of 12600 J (1875 m\/s) is somewhat higher than the \nhorizontal line of best fit drawn at c. 1350 mm2 damage area.  This implies that, perhaps, \nthere is a small increase in the level of damage area at this elevated velocity. Nevertheless \nit is still considerably less than the damage area seen at much lower impact energies such \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 19\nas at 180 J where c. 2100 mm2 of damage was observed. Furthermore, analyses of the \npolished sections revealed that the through-thickness level of damage was largely similar \nfor the 1199 m\/s and 1875 m\/s firings. However, the volume of damage appeared less \nwith the 1875 m\/s impact test when compared to the lower velocity test data. This is \nshown in Figure 9. We should also point out that the pattern of damage observed here \ndiffered substantially from the through-thickness damage reported in [4] where petalling \nor plug formation was apparent.  In this impact velocity range, the through-thickness \ndelamination in the composite occurred consistently throughout the entire thickness of \nthe CFRP laminate. For the sample struck at 1199 m\/s consistent delamination was seen \nin the first three laminae whereas little damage occurred in the layers four to eight. On \nthe other hand, the remaining layers exhibited extensive delamination and matrix \ncracking. Furthermore, it was observed for the sample struck at 1875 m\/s that extensive \ndamage occurred in the initial laminae and the rear laminae. As observed in the previous \nimpacted and analysed samples [4], delamination and matrix cracks were seen between \nthe different laminates and also between different fibre tows. Unlike the targets impacted \nat the lower energies [4], the greatest extension of damage was not located towards the \nrear of the targets but rather it was more centrally located. \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 20\n \nFigure 9: Traced detail of damage from targets that have been subjected to impact at: (a) 5150 J \n(1199 m\/s) and, (b) 12600 J (1875 m\/s). \n \nDespite the level of damage remaining broadly constant, the size of the \npenetration hole was seen to increase as the impact energy was increased. In Figure 10 \nwe have plotted an estimate of the area of the hole formed by the projectile as a function \nof the impact energy. In this case the estimated area is merely given by squaring the \nmaximum diameter (d) of the hole as measured from the impact face. For one \nexperiment, a single bursting element from the breach firing mechanism followed the \nprojectile down the gun barrel and enlarged the hole that was formed. This data-point has \nbeen included for completeness. Above c. 660 J, the hole diameter was larger than the \ndiameter of the projectile (12 mm) and the square of the diameter increased linearly with \nimpact energy. From the firings conducted below an impact energy of 660 J, the hole \ndiameter was very small (c. 3.9 mm) indicating that significant relaxation of the carbon-\nfibre tows had occurred leading the cavity-closure. No clear hole was formed at an \nimpact energy of 71 J as the projectile was stopped. As the impact energy was increased, \nmore material was separated from the target and pushed away from the region of the \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 21\npenetration. Therefore, a contribution to the increase in energy dissipated by the laminate \nat the higher velocities can be explained in terms of the formation of the penetration \nchannel and the subsequent increase in hole size. \n \nFigure 10: Increase in the area of the cavity formed by the impact of the steel sphere. \n \n It should be pointed out that during the course of these experiments, deformation \nof the steel sphere was observed. However, three projectiles were soft-captured in cotton \nrags to assess the degree of deformation caused by the impact. It was noted that for an \nimpact velocity of 744 m\/s, the degree of deformation for this relatively soft projectile \nwas c. 0.3 mm as measured along the minor axis. An unfired projectile was subsequently \nplaced in-between the platens of an Instron 4206 universal testing machine to assess the \nenergy required to deform the projectile by 0.3 mm.   We concede that this is a relatively \ncrude estimate of the energy required to deform the sphere as it negates the high strain \nrate effects that the sphere would have been subjected to during impact. Nevertheless, the \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 22\nenergy required to deform the sphere was calculated at 1 J and represents a tiny fraction \nof the 424 J that was expended at this impact velocity. Consequently, the energy \nexpended by the sphere is small in comparison to that of the target.  The majority of the \nenergy that is dissipated in the CFRP laminate is from the comminution of the CFRP \nmaterial and in the kinetic energy transferred to the particulated material. Given the low \ntrans-laminar strength of these CFRP laminates [17] and the weakness of the exposed \nfibres caused by the matrix particulation (Figure 6), the majority of the energy would be \ngiven up in the kinetic energy of the particulates. It is also interesting to note that this is \nalso seen in the ballistic impact of unconfined ceramics where relatively little energy is \nrequired to create new fracture surfaces and instead a large portion of kinetic energy of \nthe projectile is transferred to the ejected fragments of the ceramic [20]. This is \nparticularly important in analytical model formulations based on energy conservation \nwhere perforation is predicted.  \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng. Vol. 36 (9), pp. 1136-1142 \n 23\nCONCLUSIONS \n \nA series of impact test have been carried out on a woven CFRP laminate that was \nmanufactured using the RTM process. In this work we have identified that: \n(1) Using data from [4], the ballistic limit of the 6-mm thick CFRP laminate subjected to \nimpact and penetration by a 12 mm steel sphere is between 141 m\/s and 179 m\/s; the \nperforation threshold energy lies in-between 71 J and 115 J; \n(2) The percentage of kinetic energy dissipated by the CFRP laminate approached an \nasymptotic level at relatively high (c. > 2000 J) impact energies; \n(3) There is a rapid rise in the diameter of the cavity formed with impact energy until an \nimpact energy of 662 J is reached; \n(4) Above an impact energy of 662 J, the area of the perforation hole appeared to scale \nlinearly with impact energy. \n(5) Although the percentage of kinetic energy dissipated by the CFRP laminate appears \nconstant at the higher levels of impact, the degree of damage as measured by C-scan is \nconstant. This implies that the increase in the energy dissipated by the CFRP laminate is \nindependent to the degree of damage due to delamination. Consequently, the increase in \nthe energy transfer can be attributed to the expansion of the cavity and more importantly, \nthe kinetic energy of the particulates. \n \nInt. J. of Impact Engng.
