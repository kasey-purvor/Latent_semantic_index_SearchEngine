But it began to take on a fresh life \nin the late 1990s when it was reconsidered in the context of the logic of belief change. \nTwo new ideas appeared in independent work of Odinaldo Rodrigues and Rohit \nParikh: the relation of relevance was considered modulo the choice of a background \nbelief set, and the belief set was put into a canonical form, called its finest splitting. In \nthe first part of this paper, we recall the ideas of Rodrigues and Parikh, and show that \nthey yield equivalent definitions of what may be called canonical cell\/path relevance. \nThe second part presents the main new result of the paper: while the relation of \ncanonical relevance is syntax-independent in the usual sense of the term, it \nnevertheless remains language-dependent in a deeper sense, as is shown with an \nexample. The final part of the paper turns to questions of application, where we \npresent a new concept of parameter-sensitive relevance that relaxes the \nRodrigues\/Parikh definition, allowing it to take into account extra-logical sources as \nwell as purely logical ones.   \n \nKeywords: relevance, letter-sharing, belief change, splitting, language-dependence.  \n \n \nFrom Syntactic to Canonical Cell\/Path Relevance \n \n1. Logical Relevance as a Two-Place Relation between Formulae \n \nAttempts to give formal expression to the notion of relevance between propositional \nformulae go back at least to Belnap (1960), who suggested that a necessary, but not \nsufficient, condition for one formula to be relevant to another is that they share some \nelementary letter. We call this syntactical relevance. \n \nDefinition 1.1. Let a,b be formulae of a given propositional logic. They are \nsyntactically relevant to each other iff they share some elementary letter. \n \nIn the same paper, Belnap went on to propose that relevance of antecedent to \nconsequent should serve as an adequacy condition for any acceptable entailment \nrelation in propositional logic. While classical logic fails syntactic relevance, his \nsubclassical logic E (for \u2018entailment\u2019) satisfies that formal condition, as do a number \nof other subsystems of classical logic that came to be known as \u2018relevance logics\u2019.  \n \nThe present paper is not at all concerned with such relevance logics, and we have no \ndesire to weaken the classical one. We are interested in the concept of relevance itself. \nOur purpose is to see how far the simple idea of letter-sharing may be developed into \na well-behaved formal account of relevance in classical propositional contexts, and \nexamine its application to the theory of belief change. \n \n 2 \nPoor behaviour of syntactic relevance. (1) The relation is syntax-dependent. In other \nwords, formulae a,b may be classically equivalent to a\uf0a2,b\uf0a2 respectively, and a relevant \nto b but a\uf0a2 not relevant to b\uf0a2. Moreover (2), for any a, b there are a\uf0a2, b\uf0a2 to which they \nare respectively classically equivalent, with a\uf0a2 syntactically relevant to b\uf0a2. \n \nExample 1.1. For (1), the formula \uf0d8p\uf0d9(\uf0d8p\uf0daq) is syntactically relevant to q, but the \nformer is classically equivalent to \uf0d8p which is not relevant to q when these letters are \nchosen as distinct. For (2), just put e.g. a\uf0a2 \uf03d a\uf0da(r\uf0d9\uf0d8r) and b\uf0a2 \uf03d b\uf0da(r\uf0d9\uf0d8r).  \n \nNotation. We are using p,q,\u2026 for elementary letters, a,b,..,x,y,\u2026 for arbitrary \nformulae, A,B,..,K,\u2026 for sets of formulae, and \u251c, \u2524\u251c  for the relations of classical \npropositional consequence and equivalence. Classical consequence as an operation is \nwritten Cn, with Cn(A) \uf03d {x: A\u251c x} as usual. A formula is called contingent iff it is \nneither a tautology nor a contradiction. \n \nTo overcome the shortcomings of the syntactic notion, an obvious first move is to \nexpress each formula in its least letter-set, using the well-known least letter-set \ntheorem:  \n \nTheorem 1.1. For every set A of formulae, there is a unique least set of elementary \nletters such that A may equivalently be expressed using only letters from that set.  \n \nExample 1.2. The unique least letter-set of \uf0d8p\uf0d9(\uf0d8p\uf0daq) is {p} since \uf0d8p\uf0d9(\uf0d8p\uf0daq) is \nequivalent to \uf0d8p. On the other hand, the unique least letter-set of \uf0d8p\uf0d9(\uf0d8r\uf0daq) is \n{p,q,r}, as the formula is not equivalent to any other formula lacking any of those \nletters.  \n \nComments on least letter-set theorem. This theorem should figure in every textbook \nof elementary logic, but in fact is rarely so much as mentioned. We recall:   \n \n\uf0b7 Strictly speaking, it holds in this simple form only when the language has a \nprimitive zero-ary operator (propositional constant) such as the falsum \uf05e. In \nsuch a language, the least letter-set of any tautology or contradiction is \uf0c6. \nWithout a zero-ary connective, say with just \uf0d8,\uf0d9,\uf0da, tautologies and \ncontradictions have many minimal letter-sets (in fact, all the singleton letter \nsets), but no least one (since no formula is bereft of letters). For simplicity of \nformulation, in this paper we work with the falsum.  \n \n\uf0b7 Intuitively, the least letter-set theorem is just what anyone would expect, but it \nneeds proof. Getting minimal letter sets is trivial since every formula contains \nonly finitely many letters. But getting a least one (which, by the antisymmetry \nof set-inclusion, will be unique) requires a bit more work \u2013 see e.g. the \nappendix of Makinson (2007).  \n \n\uf0b7 Letters in the least letter-set of A are said to be essential (to A) or irredundant \n(in A), those outside are called inessential or redundant (in A). \n \n 3 \n\uf0b7 With this terminology, the theorem may be stated in another manner: the set of \nall letters separately redundant in A, is jointly redundant in A, in the sense that \nA may equivalently be expressed without any of them.  \n \nWhen a formula a has no redundant letters, i.e. when all letters occurring in a are in \nits least letter-set, we say that it is in least letter-set form. It is convenient to use a \nchoice function, writing a* for an arbitrarily chosen formula in least letter-set form \nthat is equivalent to a. The formula a* is called a least letter-set version of a. \nLikewise for sets A of formulae. \n \nDefinition 1.2. Let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic. They are said to be \nessentially relevant to each other iff a*,b* share some elementary letter. Equivalently: \niff every formula equivalent to a shares a letter with every formula equivalent to b. \n \nExample 1.3. Although \uf0d8p\uf0d9(\uf0d8p\uf0daq) is syntactically relevant to q, it is not essentially \nso, since (\uf0d8p\uf0d9(\uf0d8p\uf0daq))* = \uf0d8p shares no letter with q* = q. \n      \nFeatures of essential relevance \n\uf0b7 It is syntax-independent in the usual sense: when a, b are tautologically \nequivalent to a\uf0a2, b\uf0a2 respectively, then a is essentially relevant to b iff a\uf0a2 is \nessentially relevant to b\uf0a2 (immediate from definition). \n\uf0b7 No two distinct elementary letters are relevant to each other (immediate from \ndefinition).  \n\uf0b7 It is symmetric (immediate from definition). \n\uf0b7 Reflexive? Nearly: every contingent formula is relevant to itself. Non-\ncontingent formulae are not relevant to anything (given the presence of the \nfalsum in our language). \n\uf0b7 Not transitive. Example: p is essentially relevant to p\uf0d9q which is so to q, but p \nis not to q. \n\uf0b7 Cannot be \u2018made transitive\u2019: its transitive closure makes any two contingent \nformulae relevant to each other. Verification: Take contingent a,c. Since they \nare contingent, a* and c* contain letters p and q. Put b = p\uf0d9q = b*.  Then a is \nessentially relevant to b, also b to c, so transitive closure would make a \nrelevant to c.  \n \nThis is all part of the folklore and well documented in the literature (see Appendix A). \nHowever, things began to take a fresh turn in the late 1990s, when a few people began \nthinking about relevance in the light of formal accounts of belief change. Two basic \ninsights emerged. The first was that in that context, the relevance or irrelevance of one \nformula to another may be taken to depend not only on the formulae themselves but \nalso on the choice of a background belief set. The second was that this belief set may \nbe given a canonical form known as its finest splitting.  \n \nAs these developments are not very widely known, we explain and comment on them \nin the following two sections. To help the reader keep track of successive definitions, \nAppendix B contains a table of all the different kinds of relevance examined in the \ntext. \n 4 \n \n \n2. Path-Relevance Modulo a Belief Set  \n \nConsider any three distinct elementary letters p, q, r. They are not essentially relevant \nto each other. Now consider the belief set K = {p\uf0aeq, q\uf0aer}. Then it is natural to say \nthat from the point of view of K, the letter p is relevant to q, q is relevant to r, and p is \nindirectly relevant to r.  This suggests the following definition. \n \nDefinition 2.1. (Rodrigues). Let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic, and \nlet K be a set of formulae serving as a belief set. We say that a is path-relevant to b \n(mod K) iff there is a finite sequence x0,\u2026xn+1 (n \uf0b3 0) of formulae with x0 = a*, xn+1 = \nb*, x1,\u2026,xn \uf0ce K, and each xi shares at least one letter with xi+1. \n \nComments. Note that x1,\u2026,xn are required to be elements of K. Thus we are looking at \nfinite paths through K. On the other hand, it is not required that either of x0 = a*, xn+1 \n= b* is in K (although of course they may be). We do not require that K is closed \nunder consequence (though it may be): a belief set is understood to be an arbitrary set \nof formulae of propositional logic.   \n \nHistory. Essentially this notion was introduced by Rodrigues in his thesis (1997), \nAppendix A, definition 8.14. It was also used by Renata Wassermann in her thesis \n(1999) and in subsequent papers e.g. Riana and Wassermann (2004). Actually, these \nauthors took a,b instead of a*,b* in the definition, but we have refined it to ensure \nthat it is syntax-independent in those two arguments.  \n \nPath-relevance generalizes essential relevance in a natural way: the latter amounts to \nthe case n = 0 in Definition 2.1. Like essential relevance, path relevance is:  \n \n\uf0b7 Syntax-independent in a,b, symmetric, almost reflexive (in the same sense), \nnot transitive (even when n \uf03e 0). \nBut with K as parameter, new features emerge. One is rather positive: \n\uf0b7 Distinct elementary letters can be relevant to each other (mod K). Example: \nModulo K = {p\uf0aeq, q\uf0aer, \uf0d8s}, p is path-relevant to r but not to s. \nHowever, some other features are rather undesirable: \n\uf0b7 The relation is syntax-dependent in K. Example: Add to the above K the \nformula (r\uf0aes)\uf0da(s\uf0aer). As this is a tautology, it does not change the strength of \nK. But p is now path-relevant to s.  \n\uf0b7 The relation trivializes when the belief set is closed under classical \nconsequence. That is, when K = Cn(K), any two contingent formulae a,b are \npath-relevant to each other modulo K. Reason: Since a,b are contingent, each \nof a*, b* has at least one letter. Take any letter p in a*, any letter q in b* and \nnote that Cn(K) contains any tautology in these letters, e.g. (p\uf0da\uf0d8p)\uf0da(q\uf0da\uf0d8q). \n \nCan we get around these unpleasant features? One might try tweaking Definition 2.1 \nby replacing K by its least letter-set version K*. However, this does nothing to \neliminate syntax-dependence in K. Example: Both K = {p\uf0d9q} and the equivalent J = \n 5 \n{p,q} are already in least letter-set form, but under Definition 2.1 we have p path-\nrelevant to q modulo K, but not so modulo J.  \n \nA better idea is needed, and one was provided by Rohit Parikh in 1999. As well as \nminimizing the set of elementary letters, we need to disentangle them. The formulae \nin the background belief set K need to be \u2018combed out\u2019 so that their letters are not \nmixed up with each other more than necessary. In other words, we need to render K as \nmodular as possible. Parikh made this idea precise with his concept of the finest \nsplitting of a belief set. \n \n \n3. Splittings and Finest Splittings of a Belief Set \n \nWe begin with the definition of a splitting of a belief set K, and then pass to that of a \nfinest splitting. Notation: We write E(K) for the set of all elementary letters occurring \nin formulae of K, and E0(K) to be the least letter-set of K, i.e. E0(K) \uf03d E(K*).   \n \nDefinition 3.1. (Parikh) Let K be a contingent belief set, expressed in the language of \nclassical propositional logic (with a zero-ary connective). Let E = {Ei}i\uf0ceI be a \npartition of its least letter-set E0(K), which by contingency will be non-empty. We say \nthat E is a splitting of K iff there is a family {Bi}i\uf0ceI of sets of formulae such that each \nE(Bi) \uf0cd Ei and K  \u2524\u251c   \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI. In other words, iff K can be represented as the union of \nbelief sets each of which uses only letters from one of the cells of the partition. \n \nBackground on partitions. (1) Recall that a partition of a non-empty set is a family of \ndisjoint non-empty subsets of that set, whose union exhausts the set. (2) The partitions \nof a set can be put in one-one correspondence with the equivalence relations over the \nset. (3) One partition is said to be finer than another iff the equivalence relation \nassociated with the former is included (set-theoretically) in the equivalence relation \nassociated with the latter; equivalently, iff every cell of the first partition is a subset of \na cell of the second one. (4) Given any non-empty family of partitions of a set, the \nintersection of all the equivalence relations associated with partitions in the family is \nitself an equivalence relation over the set, and so corresponds to a partition of the set. \nWith respect to the fineness relation, it is the infimum (alias greatest lower bound or \nglb) of the family of partitions. \n \nComments on the definition of splitting. (1) A splitting of K is thus a special kind of \npartition of the least letter-set of K; it is not a partition of K itself. (2) While each \nE(Bi) \uf0cd Ei \uf0cd E0(K) it is not required that the sets Bi \uf0cd K, although their union \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI \nmust be classically equivalent to K. (3) Since each E(Bi) \uf0cd Ei and the Ei are pairwise \ndisjoint, the Bi must be \u2018almost\u2019 pairwise disjoint, in the sense that they share no \nformulae containing elementary letters. (4) Since E0(K) is the least letter-set of K and \nK is assumed contingent, it follows that in a splitting each Bi is non-empty and in fact \nE(Bi) \uf03d Ei. (5) This definition (and all those that follow) may be extended to cover the \nlimiting cases that K is inconsistent or tautologous, but at the cost of limiting-case \nclauses in definitions, theorems and proofs that distract from the main ideas. \n \nHistory. Actually, Parikh (1999) defined splittings of K for any letter-set E \uf0ca E0(K), \ne.g. E could be E(K) or the set E(L) of all letters of the language. However, it \n 6 \nsimplifies formulations to fix it at E0(K). For instance, when E \uf0c9 E0(K) then comment \n(4) above can fail at the edges. Example: Put K \uf03d {p, q\uf0da\uf0d8q}, E \uf03d E(K) \uf03d {p,q}, B1\uf03d \n{p} but B2 can be {\uf0d8\uf05e} or \uf0c6 so that E(B2) \uf0cc E2 \uf03d {q}.  \n \nExample 3.1. K = {p\uf0ae\uf0d8q, \uf0d8q\uf0aer, p\uf0das, \uf0d8s, (r\uf0aet)\uf0da(t\uf0aer)}. \n \n\uf0b7 E(K) = {p,q,r,s,t} but t is redundant, so E0(K) = {p,q,r,s}.   \n\uf0b7 The coarsest splitting of K is evidently the singleton partition of E0(K) with  \nE0(K) \uf03d {p,q,r,s} itself as the only cell, so that \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI \uf03d B1 = {p\uf0ae\uf0d8q, \n\uf0d8q\uf0aer, p\uf0das, \uf0d8s} \u2524\u251c   K. But we can do better than that.  \n\uf0b7 A less coarse splitting of K partitions E into two cells E1 = {p,q} and E2 = \n{r,s}, taking B1 = {p,\uf0d8q}, B2 = {r,\uf0d8s}, so that K \u2524\u251c  B1\uf0c8 B2.  \n\uf0b7 The finest splitting of K partitions E into four singleton cells {p}, {q}, {r}, {s} \nwith B1 = {p}, B2 = {\uf0d8q}, B3 = {r}, B4 = {\uf0d8s}, so that K \u2524\u251c  B1\uf0c8\u2026\uf0c8B4.  \n \nIn this very simple example, the finest splitting of E has singleton cells and the \nassociated sets B1 to B4 consist of literals. Of course, neither of these features need \nhold. For instance, take K = {(p\uf0aeq)\uf0d9(r\uf0aes)}. Its finest splitting is into the two-\nelement cells {p,q}, {r,s}, with B1 = {p\uf0aeq}, B2 = {r\uf0aes} consisting of non-literals. \n \nTheorem 3.1. (Parikh 1999). Every contingent set K of formulae of classical \npropositional logic has a unique finest splitting.  \n \nHistory. Theorem 3.1 was established for the finite case by Parikh (1999). It was \nextended to the infinite case by Kourousias and Makinson (2007), using a new form \nof interpolation called \u2018parallel interpolation\u2019. Both parallel interpolation and the \nfinest splitting theorem may be extended to first-order logic.  \n \nComments on the theorem. Strictly speaking, it is the finest splitting E = {Ei}i\uf0ceI of \nelementary letters that is unique. Given such a family, there will evidently be many \nfamilies {Bi}i\uf0ceI with \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI  \u2524\u251c   K and E(Bi) \uf0cd Ei. However, since in fact each E(Bi) \n\uf03d Ei, the different ways of choosing a given Bi do not affect its letters. Moreover, it \nturns out that:  \n \nObservation 3.2. For contingent K the Bi associated with the finest splitting of K are \nunique up to tautological equivalence. That is: let K be a contingent belief set, and E \n= {Ei}i\uf0ceI its finest splitting. Suppose  both K \u2524\u251c     \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI and K \u2524\u251c     \uf0c8{Bi\uf0a2}i\uf0ceI where \nE(Bi) \uf0cd Ei and E(Bi\uf0a2) \uf0cd Ei. Then each Bi \u2524\u251c  Bi\uf0a2. \n \nSketch of proof. This follows from the fact that the Bi are pairwise disjoint. For the \ndetails, see Appendix C.  \n \nAgain, it simplifies formulations if we use a choice function: \n \nDefinition 3.2. For contingent K, write K\n#\n for \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI for some particular such family \n{Bi}i\uf0ceI. We abuse terminology a little by also calling K\n#\n the finest splitting of K.  \n \n 7 \nComments on the definition of K\n#\n. (1) Clearly, when K1 \u2524\u251c  K2 then K1\n#\n \uf03d K2\n#\n. (2) Keep \nin mind that the family {Bi}i\uf0ceI is not necessarily a partition of K, but is formed from a \ncertain partition of its least letter-set E0(K). (3) Note that when the finest splitting E = \n{Ei}i\uf0ceI of K has at least two cells, then K\n#\n cannot be closed under classical \nconsequence \u2013the conjunction of any two formulae from different cells will be in \nCn(K\n#\n) but cannot be in K\n#\n. Even when there is only one cell, K\n#\n need not be closed \nunder consequence. (4) As we have defined it, the finest splitting K\n#\n is always a least \nletter-set version of K. However, a least letter-set version K* of K need not be a finest \nsplitting, as in the following simple example.  \n \nExample 3.2. Put K \uf03d {p\uf0d9q}. Then K is already in a least letter-set form, since there is \nno equivalent set of formulae in fewer letters. But it is not in a finest splitting form, \nsince K \u2524\u251c  {p}\uf0c8{q}, which partitions E(K) into two singleton cells.  \n \nIndeed, if we take a least letter-set version of a belief set K and tangle the letters up in \nany way we like, then so long as we keep it equivalent to K and do not introduce fresh \nletters, we are still in the least letter-set but can be far from a finest splitting. \n \n \n4. Using Finest Splittings to Define Canonical Relevance (Modulo a Belief Set) \n \nHow can finest splitting help make the notion of relevance modulo a belief set fully \nsyntax-independent in K as well as in a, x? We may see the finest splitting K\n#\n = \n\uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI of K as a canonical form for the belief set K, disentangling the roles of the \ndifferent elementary letters as far as is possible without altering the power of K and at \nthe same time (under our definition) eliminating redundant letters. We can then refine \nRodrigues\u2019 notion of path-relevance by taking the path through this canonical \nrepresentation K\n#\n instead of through K itself. Thus, replacing x1,\u2026,xn \uf0ce K by x1,\u2026,xn \n\uf0ce K# in Definition 2.1, we have the following:   \n  \nDefinition 4.1. Let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic, K a contingent set \nof formulae serving as a belief set, and K\n#\n the finest splitting of K. We say that a is \ncanonically path-relevant to b (mod K) iff there is a finite sequence x0,\u2026xn+1 (n \uf0b3 0) \nof formulae with x0 = a*, xn+1 = b*, x1,\u2026,xn \uf0ce K\n#\n, and each xi sharing at least one \nletter with xi+1. \n \nFeatures of canonical path-relevance modulo K: \n\uf0b7 This time x1,\u2026,xn are required to be elements of the canonical form K\n#\n, so we \nare looking at finite paths through K\n#\n (rather than through K itself). As before, \nit is not required that either of x0 = a*, xn+1 = b* is in K\n#\n (although of course \nthey may be).  \n\uf0b7 As desired, path-relevance becomes syntax-independent in the usual sense that \nit is invariant under logical equivalence in argument K as well as in a, b.  This \nfollows from the fact, noted in the comments after Definition 3.2, that \nequivalent belief sets have the same finest splitting K\n#\n.  \n\uf0b7 Like plain path-relevance, it is symmetric but not transitive (in the arguments \na,b with K fixed); almost reflexive (in the same sense as before); distinct \nelementary letters can be relevant to each other (mod K).   \n 8 \n \nThere is another way of arriving at the same concept. It also uses Parikh\u2019s notion of \nthe finest splitting K\n#\n of K, but does not consider paths. Instead, it looks at cells.  \n \nDefinition 4.2. (Parikh 1999). Let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic and \nK be a contingent set of formulae serving as a belief set with E = {Ei}i\uf0ceI the finest \nsplitting of K. We say that a is canonically cell-relevant to b (mod K) iff either a* \nshares some letter with b*, or there is a cell Ei of E such that each of a* and b* shares \nsome letter (not necessarily the same letter) with Ei.  \n \nMore formally: iff either E(a*)\uf0c7E(b*) is non-empty, or for some i \uf0ce I, each of the \nsets E(a*)\uf0c7Ei and E(b*)\uf0c7Ei is non-empty. \n \nTable 4.1: Illustration of canonical cell-relevance \n \nE1 E2 E3 \np                        q r                                        s   t                        u \nE(a*) E(b*) \n \nIn this illustration of the principal case of the definition, the finest partition E of K has \nthree cells, each containing two elementary letters. The letters in a* and b* are \ndisjoint, but there is a cell (the middle one) that contains letters r, s from E(a*), E(b*) \nrespectively. Thus a is canonically cell-relevant to b (mod K). However, if E(b*) \nconsisted of just t,u then a would not be canonically cell-relevant to b (mod K).  \n \nHistory. Actually, Definition 4.2 is implicit rather than explicit in Parikh (1999). \nMoreover, both that paper and Kourousias and Makinson (2007) use E(a), E(b) rather \nthan E(a*), E(b*).  \n \nSurprisingly, the following equivalence does not appear to have been noticed in the \nliterature.  \n \nTheorem 4.1. Canonical path-relevance is equivalent to canonical cell-relevance. In \ndetail: let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic, and let K be a contingent \nset of formulae serving as a belief set. Then a is canonically path-relevant to b (mod \nK) iff it is canonically cell-relevant to b (mod K). \n \nSketch of proof: Left to right, the essential idea is that there can be no paths across \ncells. Right to left, paths must span the cells. For details, see Appendix C. \n \nRemark on the theorem. The first disjunct in the definition of canonical cell relevance \ncorresponds to the case n \uf03d 0 in the definition of canonical path relevance. \n \nSummary of the story so far. By using Parikh\u2019s notion of the finest splitting of K, we \ncan refine Rodrigues\u2019 account of path-relevance to make it syntax-independent in all \nthree arguments a, b, K. This notion of canonical path-relevance is equivalent to the \n 9 \nmore semantic-looking one of canonical cell-relevance. The equivalence suggests \nrobustness of the concept, which henceforth we call simply canonical relevance.  \n \nWarning. Canonical relevance depends only on the logical power of K, but is not \nmonotonically increasing in that power. When K1 \u251c    K2 then it does not follow that if \na is canonically relevant to b modulo K2 then it is so modulo K1. Example: Put K1 \uf03d \n{p\uf0d9q}, K2 \uf03d {p\uf0aeq}. Then K1  \u251c    K2 and p is canonically relevant to q modulo K2, but \nis not so modulo K1.  \n \n \n5. Syntax-Independent \u2013 but Still Language-Dependent \n \nAs remarked in the preceding section, canonical relevance is syntax-independent in \nthe usual sense that it is invariant under logical equivalence in all three of its \narguments a,b,K. However, there is also a sense in which it is still not fully language-\nindependent. Its definition, whether via paths or cells, gives a privileged place to \nelementary letters over compound formulae. As a result, it turns out that whether one \nstate of affairs is relevant to another depends on how we deploy elementary letters in \nrepresenting them. This is the first main new result of the paper. \n \nExample 5.1. Consider the belief set {p\uf0abq, (p\uf0abq)\uf0abp}. Clearly, p is not canonically \nrelevant to (p\uf0abq)\uf0abp modulo the belief set, since p \uf03d p*, ((p\uf0abq)\uf0abp)* \uf03d q, and the \nbelief set is equivalent to {p,q}. Now suppose we represent our states of affairs in a \ndifferent manner. Noting that the formulae p and p\uf0abq are logically independent of \neach other (all four combinations of their truth and falsity are possible), we might let \nthe letter p continue to represent the same state of affairs as before, but use the letter q \nto stand for the one previously denoted by p\uf0abq. Then the formula q\uf0abp stands for the \nstate of affairs previously represented by (p\uf0abq)\uf0abp. So under our second \nrepresentation scheme, the belief set is written as {q, q\uf0abp}, which is again equivalent \nto {p,q}. We now ask whether p (corresponding to the old p) is canonically relevant to \nq\uf0abp (corresponding to the old (p\uf0abq)\uf0abp) modulo the new belief set. This time the \nanswer is trivially positive (modulo any belief set) since p* \uf03d p shares a letter with \n(q\uf0abp)* \uf03d q\uf0abp. Changing the way in which we represent states of affairs has thus \nchanged the answer to our question! \n \nIn case this looks like a sleight-of-hand, we review Example 5.1 more formally. First, \nwe give the construction itself.  \n \nObservation 5.1. Let L be the propositional language generated by the letters {p,q}, \nand define f: L \uf0ae L by putting f(p) \uf03d p, f(q) \uf03d p\uf0abq, and homomorphic for compound \nformulae. Then there is a bijection \uf06a between valuations on the language such that for \nall formulae a \uf0ce L, v(a) \uf03d v\uf0a2(f(a)), where v\uf0a2: L \uf0ae {0,1} is the counterpart \uf06a(v) of v: L \n\uf0ae {0,1}. \n \nThe homomorphism condition means of course that f(\uf0d8a) \uf03d \uf0d8f(a), f(a\uf0d9b) \uf03d f(a)\uf0d9f(b), \nf(a\uf0dab) \uf03d f(a)\uf0daf(b), f(\uf05e) \uf03d \uf05e. The good behaviour of the formula-homomorphism f \nwith respect to the valuation-bijection \uf06a gives mathematical content to the intuitive \nidea that f does not alter semantic structure; more specifically, that the formula a \n 10 \nrepresents (under v) the same \u2018state of affairs\u2019 as f(a) does (under v\uf0a2). For a proof of \nObservation 5.1, see Appendix C.  \n \nNow checking for what is relevant to what, we see (Figure 5.1): \n \n\uf0b7 On the one hand, trivially the formula p is canonically relevant to q\uf0abp \nmodulo the belief set K \uf03d {q, q\uf0abp} (or any other) since p* \uf03d p shares a letter \nwith (q\uf0abp)* \uf03d q\uf0abp.  \n \n\uf0b7 On the other hand, f(p) \uf03d p is not canonically relevant to f(q\uf0abp) \uf03d (p\uf0abq)\uf0abp \nmodulo f(K) \uf03d f({q, q\uf0abp}) \uf03d {p\uf0abq, (p\uf0abq)\uf0abp)}, since (f(p))* \uf03d p* \uf03d p while \n(f(q\uf0abp))* \uf03d ((p\uf0abq)\uf0abp)* \uf03d q and (f(K))# \uf03d {p,q} = K#.  \n \n \nFigure 5.1. Example of language-dependence of canonical relevance modulo K \n \n \n \n \n \nThus, while the concept of canonical relevance is syntax-independent as usually \nunderstood, i.e. invariant under logical equivalence in all three of its arguments, it \nnevertheless remains language-dependent, in the deeper sense that it is not invariant \nunder different representations of the same state of affairs \u2013 even when the \nrepresentations are in the same language. To this extent it is not entirely semantic, \nretaining a residual syntactic element that may be difficult or impossible to eliminate.  \n \nThe phenomenon does not appear to have been discussed in the literature, but may be \nof some importance. It goes well beyond the problem of relevance. Any concept \nwhose definition gives a privileged role to elementary letters (or in the case of \npredicate logic, atomic formulae) is likely to be language-dependent in the same way. \nThis seems to be the case, for example, with certain concepts that have been used in \nartificial intelligence to define particular forms of nonmonotonic reasoning, notably \nthe closed world assumption and circumscription. \n 11 \n \nHow should the language-dependence of the relation of canonical relevance be \nappreciated? Two contrasting attitudes suggest themselves. \n \n\uf0b7 It may be felt that in view of this feature, canonical relevance is not much \nbetter behaved than its less sophisticated predecessors, which were seen to be \nsyntax-dependent in one or more of their arguments a, x, K. For this reason it \nshould simply be abandoned (along with all other language-dependent \nconcepts such as circumscription). \n \n\uf0b7 On the other hand, it may be felt that language-dependent notions (and perhaps \neven some syntax-dependent ones) do have their legitimate uses, particularly \nin computational contexts.  \n \nWithout taking a definite stance on this delicate question, we note that canonical \nrelevance has very interesting interactions with operations of belief change, which we \nnow examine.   \n \n \n6. Respecting Relevance in Belief Change  \n \nHow far do operations of belief change in the manner of Alchourr\u00f3n, G\u00e4rdenfors and \nMakinson (1985), briefly AGM, respect relevance? We begin by reviewing the state \nof play, focussing on the operation of contraction (thus leaving aside revision) and \nomitting all proofs (which can be found in Kourousias and Makinson (2007)).  \n \nDefinition 6.1. We say that an operation \uf02d of contraction on a contingent belief set K \nrespects canonical relevance (briefly, when no ambiguity is possible, respects \nrelevance) iff whenever K \u251c   x but K\uf02da  \u251c \/ x then a is canonically relevant to x (mod K). \nContrapositively, when K \u251c     x and a is canonically irrelevant to x (mod K) then still \nK\uf02da \u251c   x.  \n \nComment. When K is closed under classical consequence, i.e. when K = Cn(K) then \nfor AGM contraction K\uf02da is also closed under consequence, so we have K \u251c   x iff x \uf0ce \nK and likewise  K\uf02da \u251c    x iff x \uf0ce K\uf02da. In this situation, Definition 6.1 is equivalent to \none with epsilon replacing turnstile: whenever x \uf0ce K and a is canonically irrelevant to \nx (mod K) then still x \uf0ce K\uf02da.  \n \nObservation 6.1. (Parikh 1999): AGM contraction can fail to respect relevance, and \nthis can happen independently of whether K is closed under consequence. \n \nExample 6.1. Let p,q be two distinct elementary letters, and put K = Cn(p,q). Then \nthere is an AGM maxichoice contraction that puts K\uf02dp to be Cn(p\uf0abq), thus \neliminating not only p but also q from K. However, the letter q is canonically \nirrelevant to p modulo K, because we can split E = {p,q} into E1 = {p}, E2 = {q} with \nK\n#\n = {p}\uf0c8{q}.   \n \nThe example is robust in the sense that it goes through when we work with belief \nbases rather than belief sets already closed under consequence. Put K0 = {p\uf0abq,q}, so \n 12 \nthat Cn(K0) = K above. Then one of the AGM maxichoice base contractions puts K0\uf02dp \nto be {p\uf0abq}, which eliminates q. However, the eliminated letter q is canonically \nirrelevant to p modulo K0 for the same reason as before. \n \nTheorem 6.2 (Kourousias and Makinson 2007). If we apply AGM contraction to the \nfinest splitting K\n#\n of a contingent belief set K, rather than to K itself, then it respects \nrelevance.  \n \nExample 6.2. When given K = Cn(p,q) or K0 = {p\uf0abq,q} the theorem instructs us to \napply the contraction operation to the canonical belief set K\n#\n = K0\n#\n = {p,q}. Since \nthere is just one maximal p-nonimplying subset of K\n#\n, namely {q}, there is just one \npossible output for an AGM belief contraction K\n#\uf02dp, namely {q}.     \n \nComments. (1) Actually, the observation of Parikh (1999) was made for AGM \nrevision, but the counterexamples for revision and contraction are essentially the \nsame. (2) Theorem 6.2 was established by Kourousias and Makinson (2007) for the \nepsilon version of Definition 6.1, rather than the turnstile version. When a belief set is \nnot closed under classical consequence (as in the case of K\n#\n) the two versions are not \nthe same, as remarked by Pavlos Peppas (personal communication). However, it is not \ndifficult to obtain the turnstile version of the theorem from the epsilon one, as is done \nin Appendix C. \n \n \n7. Should Canonical Relevance always be Respected? \n \nOf course, we may ask whether eliminating canonically irrelevant formulae really is a \nshortcoming for a belief contraction operation. Assuming that canonical relevance \nmodulo a belief set is itself a reasonable notion to work with (despite its language-\ndependence, already noted) we may still ask: is failure to respect it a defect, or just a \nfeature, of AGM contraction?  \n \nIt appears that the answer depends on whether we want our contractions to take into \naccount only formal considerations, or also epistemic ones. To see this, consider again \nthe example where we wish to contract the belief base K0 = {p\uf0abq,q} by p.  \n \nWe know that K\n#\n = {p,q}, so that while p\uf0abq is canonically relevant to p modulo K0, \nq is not. So if the contraction is to respect relevance, it will eliminate p\uf0abq, but not q. \nBut it may happen that the formula p\uf0abq has a special place among our beliefs. It may \nbe more deeply entrenched, less vulnerable, or in some other way epistemically more \nbasic than the letters p,q or their conjunction p\uf0d9q, all of which are elements of \nCn(K0). In that context, when discarding p we should keep the biconditional p\uf0abq and \njettison the letter q. The eliminated formula q is not logically relevant to the formula p \nthat we are discarding, but it is epistemically so, since it occurs in a formula p\uf0abq to \nwhich we are attributing special epistemic status within the belief set.  \n \nIn general, when a belief set is presented by a base, we may have differing attitudes \ntowards the propositions in the base. They may be there by happenstance, and any \nother base might be deemed as just as appropriate so long as it is equivalent (and \nperhaps satisfies general requirements such as being computable or schematic). But \n 13 \nother propositions may be in the base because we want them to be there; they may \nhave an epistemic priority over items outside the base. Even within the base, some \nelements may have priority over others. From this perspective, taking epistemic \nmatters into account, we will not need to respect canonical relevance.  \n \n \n8. Parameter- Sensitive Relevance \n \nIf we are interested in epistemic factors in belief change, we may well wish to develop \nthe concept of canonical relevance to take account of them. How could we go about \nit? Of course, logic alone cannot specify which propositions have what epistemic \nstatus. But it can introduce into its constructions parameters that allow such \nspecifications to play a role. In this section we introduce such a parameter. This is the \nsecond main new construction of the paper. \n \nDefinitions and theorems correspond to earlier unparametrized ones, and are \nnumbered by their counterparts with a plus sign. We begin by observing that the finest \nsplitting theorem may be strengthened to cover an arbitrary family of splittings, rather \nthan just the family of all splittings of K.   \n \nTheorem 3.1\n\uf02b\n. Let K be any contingent set of formulae of classical propositional logic. \nThe infimum of any non-empty family of splittings of K is also a splitting of K.  \n \nProof: The proof of Theorem 3.1 (the finest splitting theorem) that is given in \nKourousias and Makinson (2007) may be applied without change.        \n \nNext, we notice that the concept of canonical cell\/path relevance, which was \nintroduced in Definition 4.2 using the finest splitting of K, generalizes without change \nwith respect to an arbitrary splitting. In terms of cells, for instance, we have:  \n \nDefinition 4.2\n\uf02b\n. Let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic and K be a \ncontingent set of formulae serving as a belief set with E = {Ei}i\uf0ceI any splitting of K. \nWe say that a is relevant to b (mod E) iff a* shares some letter with b*, or there is a \ncell Ei of E such that each of a* and b* shares some letter (not necessarily the same \nletter) with Ei.  \n \nThe notion of respect for relevance, introduced Definition 6.1, similarly generalizes:  \n \nDefinition 6.1\n\uf02b\n. Let K be a contingent set of formulae serving as a belief set, and E = \n{Ei}i\uf0ceI any splitting of K. We say that an operation \uf02d of contraction on K respects \nrelevance modulo E iff whenever K \u251c   x but K\uf02da  \u251c \/ x then a is relevant to x modulo E.  \n \nWith these generalized definitions available, we can now introduce a parameter R to \nhandle extra-logical (and in particular, epistemic) sources of relevance. R is a relation \nbetween elementary letters, permitting us to stipulate that certain letters are \nepistemically relevant to others. \n \nDefinition 8.1. Let K be a contingent set of formulae serving as a belief set, with E its \nleast letter-set. Let R be any relation between letters in E. We say that a splitting E = \n{Ei}i\uf0ceI of K protects R  iff whenever (p,q) \uf0ce R then p,q are in the same cell Ei of E.  \n 14 \n \nWe may now apply Theorem 3.1\n\uf02b\n to the family of all R-protecting splittings of K: \n \nCorollary to Theorem 3.1\n\uf02b\n. Let K be a contingent set of formulae serving as a belief \nset, with E its least letter-set. Let R be any relation between letters in E. Then K has a \n(unique) finest R-protecting splitting.  \n \nProof. Since R \uf0cd E2, there is at least one splitting that protects R, namely the coarsest \n(one-cell) splitting. Hence by Theorem 3.1\n\uf02b\n, the infimum of all R-protecting splittings \nof K is a splitting of K, and it is immediate that it protects R.  \n \nThe relation of relevance modulo the finest R-protecting splitting of K (rather than \nmodulo its finest splitting) may naturally be referred to as R-sensitive relevance. \nWhen the pairs in R represent declarations of epistemic connections between letters, it \nmay be thought of as representing epistemically sensitive relevance.  \n \nThe extent to which R-sensitive relevance goes beyond canonical relevance evidently \ndepends on how much is put into the protected relation R. In the limiting case that R is \nempty, the two coincide; in the other limiting case that R contains all pairs of letters, \nwe get the one-cell partition of E \uf03d E0(K) and so end up with Rodrigues\u2019 path-\nrelevance without splitting as in section 2. \n \nWe end by noting that the same proof as for Theorem 6.2 gives us more generally: \n \nTheorem 6.2\n\uf02b\n. Let K be a contingent set of formulae serving as a belief set, with E its \nleast letter-set. Let R be any relation between letters in E. If we apply AGM \ncontraction to the finest R-protecting splitting rather than to K itself, then it respects \nrelevance modulo that same splitting.  \n \n \nAppendices \n \nAppendix A: Literature on Relevance as a Two-Place Relation \n \nFor an overview and extended bibliography of work on propositional relevance as a \ntwo-place relation between formulae, see Lang et al (2003). This paper gives \nparticular attention to computational questions. Although the authors mention the \nseminal paper Parikh (1996) in passing, they do not investigate relevance modulo the \nfinest splitting of a background belief set. In their treatment of the notion of an \nessential letter they follow Ryan (1991) in dividing the concept into two parts, thereby \ngiving it a polarity. Expressed in the manner of the present paper, we may say that a \nformula a sometimes depends on a positive value for the letter p iff there is a valuation \nv with v(a) \uf03d1 but vp\uf03d0(a) \uf03d 0, where vp\uf03d0 is the valuation that agrees with v on all \nletters other than p but gives p the value 0. Likewise, a sometimes depends on a \nnegative value for the letter p iff there is a valuation v with v(a) \uf03d1 but vp\uf03d1(a) \uf03d 0. \nEvidently, the two kinds of dependence do not exclude each other. As Lang et al \n(2003) observe, it is immediate that the essential letters of a formula are just those on \nwhich it sometimes depends either positively or negatively.  \n \n \n 15 \nAppendix B: Table of Kinds of Relevance Discussed \n \nName  Arguments Syntax- \nindependent? \nLanguage-\nindependent? \nsyntactic \nrelevance \n \nformulae \nno  \n \n \n \n \nno \nessential \nrelevance \nyes \npath-relevance  \nformulae, belief set K \n \n \nyes, except for K \n \ncell-relevance \ncanonical \n(path\/cell) \nrelevance \nyes \nR-sensitive \nrelevance \nformulae, belief set K, \nrelation R over letters \nyes \n \n \nAppendix C: Proofs \n \nObservation 3.2. For contingent K the Bi in the finest splittings of K are unique up to \ntautological equivalence. That is: let K be a contingent belief set, and E = {Ei}i\uf0ceI its \nfinest splitting. Suppose  both K \u2524\u251c   \uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI and K \u2524\u251c   \uf0c8{Bi\uf0a2}i\uf0ceI where E(Bi) \uf0cd Ei and \nE(Bi\uf0a2) \uf0cd Ei. Then each Bi \u2524\u251c  Bi\uf0a2. \n \nNotation. We write v(X) \uf03d 1 as shorthand for v(x) \uf03d 1 for all x \uf0ce X, while v(X) \uf03d 0 \nabbreviates v(x) \uf03d 0 for some x \uf0ce X. \n \nProof. Suppose otherwise. Then there is a valuation u with say u(Bj) \uf03d 1 and u(Bj\uf0a2) \uf03d \n0. Since K is consistent, there is also a valuation v with v(K) = 1 so v(Bi) \uf03d v(Bi\uf0a2) \uf03d 1 \nfor all i \uf0ce I. Let w be the valuation that agrees with u on all letters in Ej and agrees \nwith v on all other letters. Then w(K) \uf03d w(\uf0c8{Bi}i\uf0ceI)  \uf03d 1 while also w(K) \uf03d \nw(\uf0c8{Bi\uf0a2}i\uf0ceI)  \uf03d 0 giving a contradiction.  \n \nTheorem 4.1. Canonical path-relevance is equivalent to canonical cell-relevance. In \ndetail: let a,b be formulae of classical propositional logic, and let K be a contingent \nset of formulae serving as a belief set. Then a is canonically path-relevant to b (mod \nK) iff it is canonically cell-relevant to b (mod K). \n \nProof. The theorem is immediate when a* shares a letter with b*. So suppose \notherwise.  \n \n 16 \nLeft to right: Suppose that a is canonically path-relevant to b (mod K). Then there is a \nfinite sequence x0,\u2026xn+1 of formulae with x0 = a*, xn+1 = b*, all of x1,\u2026,xn \uf0ce K\n#\n, and \neach xi sharing at least one letter with xi+1. Since a* shares no letter with b*, we have \nn \uf0b3 1. Let p be a letter shared by x0 = a* and x1, and let q be a letter shared by xn and \nxn+1 = b*. Since all of x1,\u2026,xn \uf0ce K\n#\n, and each xi shares at least one letter with xi+1, it \nfollows that all of the letters in x1,\u2026,xn come from the same cell Ei of the finest \nsplitting of K. Thus in particular p and q come from the same cell Ei, so each of the \nsets E(a*)\uf0c7Ei and E(b*)\uf0c7Ei is non-empty as required for canonical cell-relevance.    \n \nRight to left: Suppose that a is canonically cell-relevant to b (mod K). Then there is a \ncell Ei of the finest splitting E of K such that each of the sets E(a*)\uf0c7Ei and E(b*)\uf0c7Ei \nis non-empty. So there are letters p, q \uf0ce Ei with p occurring in a* and q occurring in \nb*. Since p, q \uf0ce Ei and K\n#\n is in least letter-set form, they must occur in formulae y, z \n\uf0ce Bi \uf0cd K\n#\n. To complete the proof we need to show that there are x1,\u2026,xn (n \uf0b3 0) in K\n#\n \nwith y = x1, xn = z and each xi sharing a letter with xi+1. But this must hold because \notherwise we could take the closure {y}\n+\n of {y} under the relation of sharing a letter, \nto divide Ei further into non-empty sets E({y}\n+\n) and Ei\\ E({y}\n+\n) which would split K \nfurther.   \n \nObservation 5.1. Let L be the propositional language generated by the letters {p,q}, \nand define f: L \uf0ae L by putting f(p) \uf03d p, f(q) \uf03d p\uf0abq, and homomorphic for compound \nformulae. Then there is a bijection \uf06a between valuations on the language such that \nsuch that for all formulae a \uf0ce L, v(a) \uf03d v\uf0a2(f(a)), where v\uf0a2: L \uf0ae {0,1} is the counterpart \n\uf06a(v) of v: L \uf0ae {0,1}. \n \nProof. We construct the bijection \uf06a as follows: for each valuation v: L \uf0ae {0,1} define \n\uf06a(v) \uf03d v\uf0a2: L \uf0ae {0,1} by setting v\uf0a2(p) \uf03d v(p) and v\uf0a2(q) \uf03d v(p\uf0abq). We need to check that \n(1) \uf06a is a bijection between valuations on L, and (2) for all formulae a \uf0ce L, v(a) \uf03d \nv\uf0a2(f(a). \n \nFor (1), since the set of valuations is finite (4 elements), it suffices to show that \uf06a is \ninjective. Suppose v \uf0b9 w; we need to show v\uf0a2 \uf0b9 w\uf0a2. Case 1: Suppose v(p) \uf0b9 w(p). Then \nimmediately v\uf0a2(p) \uf03d v(p) \uf0b9 w(p) \uf03d w\uf0a2(p) and we are done. Case 2: Suppose v(p) \uf03d w(p) \nbut v(q) \uf0b9 w(q). Then v(p\uf0abq) \uf0b9 w(p\uf0abq) so v\uf0a2(q) \uf03d v(p\uf0abq) \uf0b9 w(p\uf0abq) \uf03d w\uf0a2(q) and \nagain we are done. \n \nFor (2), it suffices to show that v(p) \uf03d v\uf0a2(f(p)) and v(q) \uf03d v\uf0a2(f(q)). The former is \nimmediate since v\uf0a2(f(p)) \uf03d v\uf0a2(p) \uf03d v(p) by the constructions of f and v\uf0a2. For the latter, \nv\uf0a2(f(q)) \uf03d v\uf0a2(p\uf0abq) by the construction of f. Case 1: Suppose v(q) \uf03d 1. Then v\uf0a2(q) \uf03d \nv(p\uf0abq) \uf03d v(p) \uf03d v\uf0a2(p) so v\uf0a2(p\uf0abq) \uf03d 1, giving us v(q) \uf03d v\uf0a2(f(q)) as desired. Case 2: \nSuppose v(q) \uf03d 0. Then v\uf0a2(q) \uf03d v(p\uf0abq) \uf03d v(\uf0d8p) \uf03d v\uf0a2(\uf0d8p) so v\uf0a2(p\uf0abq) \uf03d 0, again giving \nus v(q) \uf03d v\uf0a2(f(q)) as desired. \n \nTheorem 6.2.  If we apply AGM contraction to the finest splitting K\n#\n of a contingent \nbelief set K, rather than to K itself, then it respects relevance.  \n \nProof. In Kourousias and Makinson (2007) this was proven in an \u2018epsilon version\u2019: \nwhenever x \uf0ce K# but x \uf0cf K#\uf02da then a is canonically relevant to x (mod K). We need \n 17 \nto derive the turnstile version of the theorem from the epsilon one. Assume the \nepsilon version, i.e. that for  contingent K, whenever x \uf0ce K# but x \uf0cf K#\uf02da then a is \ncanonically relevant to x (mod K). Suppose that K is contingent, K\n#\n \u251c  x, K\n#\uf02da  \u251c \/ x; we \nneed to show that a is canonically relevant to x (mod K).  \n \nSince K\n#\n \u251c  x we have K\n#\n \u251c  x*, so there are a1,\u2026,ak \uf0ce K\n#\n with a1\uf0d9\u2026\uf0d9ak \u251c  x*. Since K \nis consistent, we may assume without loss of generality that each ai* shares a letter \nwith x*. Since K\n#\uf02da \u251c \/ x we likewise have K#\uf02da  \u251c \/  x*, so there is an i \uf0a3 k with K#\uf02da  \u251c \/  \nai, so that ai \uf0cf K\n#\uf02da. By the epsilon version of the theorem, a is canonically relevant \nto ai (mod K). That is, there is a cell Ej of the finest partition E of K such that each of \nthe sets E(a*)\uf0c7Ej and E(ai*)\uf0c7Ej is non-empty.  \n \nTo show that a is canonically relevant to x (mod K) and complete the proof it will \nsuffice to show that E(x*)\uf0c7Ej is non-empty. But since ai \uf0ce K\n#\n all the letters of ai \ncome from the same cell, so E(ai) \uf0cd Ej. Since E(ai*) \uf0cd E(ai) this gives us E(ai*) \uf0cd Ej. \nSince ai* shares a letter with x*, this tells us that E(x*)\uf0c7Ej is non-empty as desired. \n  \nIt is also possible to prove Theorem 6.2 (turnstile version) directly, essentially by \nincluding the above considerations within a re-run of the proof of the epsilon version \nin Kourousias and Makinson (2007).  \n \n \nReferences \n \nAlchourr\u00f3n, Carlos, Peter G\u00e4rdenfors and David Makinson 1985. \u201cOn the logic of \ntheory change: partial meet contraction and revision functions\u201d.
