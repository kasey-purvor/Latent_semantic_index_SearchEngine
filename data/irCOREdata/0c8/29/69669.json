INTRODUCTION \nIt is well accepted that the increasingly sedentary lifestyle of \nmany industrialized societies is helping fuel the dramatic rises in \ntype 2 diabetes, chronic heart disease and obesity. In the UK it has \nbeen widely reported across the various News media that recent \nestimates suggest that over 40% of school age children are \noverweight or obese, and by 2010 more than half of children may \nbe obese. In addition to this, depression and mental ill health is set \nto be one of the fastest growing conditions in UK with 1 in 6 of \nthe population suffering from a neurotic disorder [4]. Whilst the \noverall reasons for this are complex there are simple things we \ncan all do to improve this situation one of which is exercise. \nHowever, many people are reluctant to engage in traditional forms \nof exercise which has led to a growth in interest of so-called \n\u2018exergaming\u2019 activities to provide novel and \u2018fun\u2019 ways of taking \nexercise. \nExergaming is a term used to describe video games that also \nprovide exercise [7], not to be confused with biometric gaming \nthat has been linked to emotional gaming in that they try to \nincorporate player\u2019s emotional responses, such as stress or \nhappiness, to influence game play. \"Exergames\" can be sub \ndivided into two main groups, those with a game specifically \ndesigned to use an exercise input device and those \nimplementations using a particular genre, or a generic game to \nprovide exercise. The Wii Fit from Nintendo is probably the most \nwell know of the former utilizing the Wii Balance Board \nperipheral to provide a series of games, the result of which are \nused to provide players with an estimate of their current fitness \nlevel and improve it. In terms of the second category Dance \nDance Revolution by Konami, and Guitar Hero from Activision \nwould exemplify a game requiring high levels of physical \ninteraction thus providing a degree of exercise. \nIn terms of mobile phones Exergames, Location Based Games \n(LBG) (i.e. games where physical movement through space is the \nprimary mechanic) [3] and motion controlled games [6] are the \nobvious examples, although in general their effects on player \nfitness are not relayed back to the player as they have no access to \nplayer real-time physiological data. With the increasing power of \nmobile phones and the recent emergence of personal heart rate \nmonitors aimed at dedicated amateur runners, there is now a \npossibility of enabling Mobile Exergaming incorporating real-\ntime physiological data along with other general fitness \napplications designed to promote well being.  \nIn this paper we present a novel heart rate and movement \ncontrolled Mobile Exergame inspired by the old arcade classic \nSpace Invaders which forms part of a general health monitoring \nsoftware for mobile phones called Heart Angel. Whilst this game \nis not the first to incorporate heart rate as a game mechanic [1] it \nis the first to provide direct real-time physiological feedback to \nthe player and run on mobile phone. \n \n \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that \ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

HEART ANGEL \nHeart Angel [2] is a health monitoring application written in \nJ2ME developed to help people monitor, record, and improve \ntheir personal health and well being through in-built standardized \ncardio-respiratory tests, or a mini-game inspired by the old arcade \nclassic Space Invaders called Health Defender.  \nThe application makes use of a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone \nto connect to a Heart Rate Monitor (HRM), as well as an inbuilt \nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) receiver to collect data on users \nHeart Rate (HR), as well as their location trail. \nHeart Angel incorporates a series of tests developed to measure \nand improve health. Users can select between a 3 minute Step-\nTest, or the recognized Rockport Test, to monitor and obtain a \nstandardized measurement of their current fitness level. Results \ncan be saved as a text file for future analysis and interpretation \nthrough the application itself, or downloaded to a computer. \nFor users requiring a more detailed analysis of their performance \nHeart Angel provides for the use of a phones inbuilt GPS receiver \ntogether with the HRM. This allows data on HR at a given time \nfor a given position to be recorded at 2 second intervals and saved \nas a text file on the device for download. Exertion Maps can then \nbe drawn for analysis seeing when, where, and why, exertion was \nhighest during the workout. Multiple workouts for the same \ncircuit can then be analyzed over time to observe improvements in \nperformance. \nHowever, in this paper we shall concentrate on the Health \nDefender game and the results obtained from initial user \nexperience. In the following section we provide greater detail of \nits design and functionality. \n3. HEALTH DEFENDER \n3.1 Introduction  \nHealth Defender makes use of an Alive Technologies HRM to \ncollect and relay HR data back on a player to a mobile phone in \nreal-time using the Bluetooth protocol. This data is used to both \ninform players on their current HR exertion during game play, and \nevents such as triggered bonuses. The objective is to encourage \nplayers to exercise during game play, through triggered bonuses, \nto both improve gaming experience, as well as personal health. \nThe objective of the game is for players to destroy as many \ninvading viruses as possible. The game tries to encourage gamers \nto actively workout during game play by triggering a Bonus \nscreen awarding different bonuses to players if their real-time \nphysiological data is raised to match the target HR exertion rate. \n3.2 Connectivity \nTo play Health Defenders players are required to enable Bluetooth \nconnectivity on their mobile phone, as well as strapping up to the \nAlive Technologies HRM Chest-Strap, as shown in Figure 1.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Alive Technologies HRM Chest-Strap connected to \nphone via Bluetooth. \n3.3 Game Play \nFigure 2 is a dual screenshot of the main game display for Health \nDefender. The top section of the screen displays information on \nthe number of lives, remaining hits, and current score for a player. \nThe bottom section of the screen shows a player\u2019s current HR \nexertion, current game level and any bonus available.  \n \n \nFigure. 2 Health Defender Game Display \n \nIn this version of Health Defender gamers interact with the game \nthrough the use of the mobile phone\u2019s keypad. Controls include \nleft and right movements, as well as firing and using any \u201cBonus\u201d \na player may have obtained. \n3.3.1 Heart Rate Controlled Events \nTo try to improve personal health and gaming experience through \nplayer interaction, this version of Health Defender makes use of \npersonal physiological data obtained via the real-time HR data \nfeed from the HRM to relay back such information on a player. \nAt random intervals during game play players are prompted with a \n\u201cBonus Screen\u201d, see Figure 3, in which players can see their: \no Starting Heart Rate: a players HR at the time the \nbonus was initiated, \no Current Heart Rate: \no Target Heart Rate: HR a player needs to match to \nsuccessfully pass the challenge before the time is up. \n \n \nFigure 3. Bonus Screen Display   \n \nWhen a player is prompted with this screen, their objective is to \nraise their HR exertion by 10 beats per min, in an unspecified \nperiod of time. How a player decides to achieve this rise in HR \nexertion is left completely up to them, whether it is jumping or \nstatically jogging.  \nIf players successfully raise their HR in the given time period the \ngame resumes at the point where the challenge was initiated with \na random bonus awarded to the player. This version of Health \nDefender awards one of two bonuses; \n1. Shield \u2013 awards three extra hits to the player.  \n2. Bombs \u2013 awards two bombs with a greater impact area, \nsee Figure 2 rightmost screenshot. \nIf players do not manage to successfully complete the challenge, \nthe game resumes at the point where the challenge was initiated \nwith no bonus awarded. The number of Bonuses a player can \npossess at any one time during game play is limited to one. The \nbonus screen will not randomly self generate until players have \nused up their current bonus. \n \nIt is through these HR exertion challenges that Health Defender \ntries to promote and improve personal health. By rewarding \nplayers for successfully increasing their HR exertion to that \nspecified, it is possible to obscure the feeling of physical workout \nfor that of a bonus, as well as unique user game play interaction.  \n4. PLAYER EXPERIENCE \nPlayer experience for the discussed version of Health Defender \nhas provided initial player feedback as well as exposed glitches in \ngame design. It was noted early into testing that the HRM was \nprone to errors due to the connection between the Chest Straps \nand a player\u2019s skin. Dampening the area of contact minimized the \nfrequency of errors, but with heart rate not being constant meant \nthat a five value filtered average for HR was implemented, both \nfor player feedback and smoother game play.  \nSome players felt that a separate Bonus screen in which to \nencourage them to raise their HR was inefficient. Though bonus \nscreens were randomly generated, it was noted that if time periods \nbetween these were too long players recovered \u201cpeacefully\u201d after \nworkouts and therefore easily perform the next, while short time \nperiods discouraged players from performing the workouts due to \nthese being too frequent and subsequently intense. A stronger \ndirect link between player exertion and awarding bonuses during \ngame play was therefore required. \nFor this reason a new approach at linking player HR to real-time \ngame play is being researched. The benefits of having a high HR \nexertion during game play would be more obvious, while only \nusing separate screens to pause game play at certain occasions. To \nachieve this player characteristics are directly linked to player \nreal-time HR values displaying different bonuses, such as \nincreased fire power, paired to different HR thresholds. This \nallows players to raise or lower their HR according to what best \nsuits them at any particular time during game play. Certain \nbonuses would be subject to timers after which a player would \nneed to lower their HR below the defined threshold to reactivate \nthe bonus, and then raise their HR to obtain it. Just as a high HR \nwould benefit a player, low HR could be of detriment to them. \nNot only is physical workout better disguised, but players are \nfurther encouraged to raise, lower and maintain their HR exertion \nintensity to improve their character during game play. This in turn \nprovides an increased health benefit over the discussed version of \nHealth Defender as HR exertion is maintained over longer periods \nof time, as well as training HR recovery. The generation of \nseparate bonus screens can then be minimized and used to award \ngreater bonuses, or penalize players if not successfully passed.  \nCertain players suggested that game controls were inappropriate \nwhile trying to exercise with some finding it hard to interact with \nthe keypad after raising their HR. For this reason the concept of \nlinking player movements directly to character movements has \nbeen investigated and implemented. Not only is game play \ninteraction further developed and improved, but physical exertion \nis also promoted through repetitive movements and a wider range \nof physical challenges being available, as discussed in Section 5.3. \nTo allow for such interaction a new version of Health Defender is \nbeing developed that makes use of three inbuilt Accelerometers \nfound in the HRM used to relay back data on frontal, lateral and \nvertical displacement to the mobile phone. Through the use of \nthese accelerometers, as opposed to the ones internal to the phone, \nthe game mechanics are harder to \u2019fake\u2019 by players. This is \nbecause players are required to strap the HRM around their chest \nto obtain a real-time ECG feed, as well as physical movement \nmeasured by the accelerometers being through the torso rather \nthan the player\u2019s hand. Therefore, unlike the movements used in \nNintendo\u2019s Wii Sports Tennis which can be simulated with the \nmere flick of the wrist once mastered by players. \nFour possible player interaction controls have been implemented \nawaiting players testing. The first involves players movements \nbeen mapped to players lateral inclination with players firing \nthrough keypad interaction. Secondly players use the keypad to \nmove, but firing is achieved through small physical jumps. The \nthird is a combination of the previous two where players move by \ninclining their bodies, while jumping to fire. The final \nimplementation lets players defining their required action (i.e. \nmove left, move right, fire) through the keypad and executing \nthem by jumping.  \nWhen player trials are conducted data on player movements as \nwell as HR exertion against time will be recorded to investigate \nthe links between player interaction and increased physical \nexertion.  \n5. FURTHER DEVELOPMENT \n5.1 Personal Data \nAdapting game play to player characteristics would be possible \nthrough the collection of personal data. By knowing a gamers\u2019 \nresting HR together with their age and weight, it would be \npossible to calculate their relative HR Training Zone intensities. \nPlayers could then set the intensity of the physical workout they \nwished to perform, with the game adapting threshold boundaries \nfor HR exertion bonuses. This would obtain the maximum \nphysical workout effectiveness [5] from players as the game is \ncalibrated to their current physical fitness level encouraging them \nto work above it. \nMore accurate and informative feedback could then be relayed \nback to players by drawing a player\u2019s HR exertion graph for the \ntotal duration of game play. Further, it would be possible to \nsubdivide this into the different HR Training Zones and show the \nduration and intensity of physical workout performed. Even \nfurther player feedback could include total calories burned during \ngame play.  \n5.2 Game Playing Environment \nBy considering how gamers will be exercising while playing \nHealth Defender it is possible to maximize the health benefits of \nexergaming, as well as the use of real-time physiological data in \ngaming.  \nThere are many different varieties of cardiovascular exercising \nmachines available with one thing in common, they are tedious to \nuse. Playing an exergame, like Health Defender, during the use of \nsuch machines would maximize the game\u2019s health benefit as well \nas providing a new game play approach. Machine specific \nchallenges could also be devised. \n5.3 Challenges \nThe discussed version of Health Defender makes use of a players \nHR to decide whether to award a bonus or not. Having suggested \na link between HR exertion to main game play allowing gamers to \nchoose when to increase their HR, as well as the incorporation of \nthe HRM Accelerometers, it is possible to extend the variety and \nintensity of exercises a player is made to perform. Exercises \ntargeted at training specific parts of the body can then be coded \ninto the game with gamers being asked to perform pushups, pull-\nups or crunches, independently or in succession, in a given time \nperiod verified by the accelerometer data feedback. With basic \ncharacter characteristic bonuses being awarded during game play, \nextra exercises could be used to award better bonuses or even as \nchallenges in a future multiplayer game environment were gamers \ncompete against each other.  \nThe combination of challenges that can be devised is endless. Not \nonly can cardiovascular endurance be improved, but so could \nbalance and strength. \n6. CONCLUSION \nPlayer trials for Health Defender have shown that it is possible to \nsuccessfully incorporate a gamers\u2019 real-time physiological data \ninto a game to improve gaming experience as well as personal \nhealth. Player trials have shown though that the link between \nplayer physical exertion and game interaction is critical for \ndeveloping a successful exergame that softens the sensation of \nphysical workout for improved game play. \nA new version of Health Defender is currently being developed \nthat takes the topics discussed under player experiences into \naccount, as well as trying to incorporate further developments to \nimprove game mechanics, game play and the level of physical \nexertion gamers perform. \n7.
