The interval under discussion occurred in the pre-midnight local time sector, during a period of weakly northward interplanetary magnetic field. A region of HF backscatter, typically 8 degrees wide, occurred in the field of view of the CUTLASS Finland radar. A well defined gradient in the spectral width parameter was present, with mainly low (< 200 m s - 1 ) spectral widths in the lower latitude part of the scatter and predominantly large (> 200 ms - 1 ) spectral widths in the higher latitude part. The relationship between the spectral width and the red line (630.0 nm) emission measured by the meridian scanning photometer is considered. The poleward border of the red line emission, which has, in the past, been proposed as being representative of the polar cap boundary, was co-located to within 1\u00b0 of magnetic latitude with the gradient in spectral width for part of the interval. Statistically, large spectral widths occurred poleward of the red line emission, while small spectral widths occurred within or equatorward of the red line emission. Near simultaneous DMSP particle observations in the 20 eV to 20 keV range indicate that the poleward border of the red line emission and the gradient in spectral width occurred at the same latitude as the transition from auroral oval to polar rain particle energies. We conclude that the large spectral widths were not caused by particle precipitation associated with the auroral oval. There were two periods of special interest when the relationship between the red line and the spectral width broke down. The first of these happened during enhanced red line and green line (557.7 nm) emission, with a drop out of the radar scatter and an enhanced, narrow westward electrojet. We conclude that this event was a magnetospheric substorm occurring at much higher than usual latitudes. The second period of special interest happened when equatorward moving bands of large spectral width occurred within the region of scatter. Up to 4 of these bands were present during an interval of 100 minutes. Associated with these narrow bands of large spectral width were narrow channels of enhanced westward ion velocities. We conclude that these equatorward moving bands of large spectral width may be related to reconnection processes in the tail. The observations demonstrate that the tail continues to be active even under low solar wind energy input conditions. Furthermore, we conclude that the gradient in the spectral width may be used as a proxy for the polar cap boundary, but only with extreme caution","downloadUrl":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2381\/702","fullTextIdentifier":"https:\/\/lra.le.ac.uk\/bitstream\/2381\/702\/1\/angeo-19-327-2001.pdf","pdfHashValue":"5daf78d22cf3202b54196b2fd634fe5cc6e500f7","publisher":null,"rawRecordXml":"<record><header><identifier>\n        \n            \n                oai:lra.le.ac.uk:2381\/702<\/identifier><datestamp>\n                2016-01-26T03:33:07Z<\/datestamp><setSpec>\n                com_2381_1<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                com_2381_9549<\/setSpec><setSpec>\n                col_2381_10633<\/setSpec>\n            <\/header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:oai_dc=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/\" xmlns:dc=\"http:\/\/purl.org\/dc\/elements\/1.1\/\" xmlns:doc=\"http:\/\/www.lyncode.com\/xoai\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc\/ http:\/\/www.openarchives.org\/OAI\/2.0\/oai_dc.xsd\" ><dc:title>\n            \nA case study of HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission in the pre midnight sector<\/dc:title><dc:creator>\nLester, M.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nMilan, Steve E.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nBesser, V.<\/dc:creator><dc:creator>\nSmith, R.<\/dc:creator><dc:description>\nAvailable from the publisher website at http:\/\/www.ann-geophys.net\/19\/327\/2001\/angeo-19-327-2001.html<\/dc:description><dc:description>\nA comparison of HF radar backscatter observed by the CUTLASS Finland radar, meridian scanning photometer data from Longyearbyen, magnetic field variations from IMAGE stations, and particle precipitation measured by the DMSP F12 spacecraft is presented.

Furthermore, we conclude that the gradient in the spectral width may be used as a proxy for the polar cap boundary, but only with extreme caution.<\/dc:description><dc:date>\n2009-12-08T16:23:59Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2009-12-08T16:23:59Z<\/dc:date><dc:date>\n2001<\/dc:date><dc:type>\nArticle<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>\nAnnales Geophysicae: Atmospheres Hydrospheres and Space Science, 2001, 19, pp.327-340<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\nhttp:\/\/www.ann-geophys.net\/19\/327\/2001\/angeo-19-327-2001.html<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\nhttp:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2381\/702<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>\n10.5194\/angeo-19-327-2001<\/dc:identifier><dc:relation>\nRAE 2007<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>\nRadio and Space Plasma Physics<\/dc:relation><dc:rights>\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2001.

A comparison of HF radar backscatter observed\nby the CUTLASS Finland radar, meridian scanning pho-\ntometer data from Longyearbyen, magnetic field variations\nfrom IMAGE stations, and particle precipitation measured\nby the DMSP F12 spacecraft is presented. The interval un-\nder discussion occurred in the pre-midnight local time sec-\ntor, during a period of weakly northward interplanetary mag-\nnetic field. A region of HF backscatter, typically 8 degrees\nwide, occurred in the field of view of the CUTLASS Finland\nradar. A well defined gradient in the spectral width param-\neter was present, with mainly low (< 200 m s\u22121) spectral\nwidths in the lower latitude part of the scatter and predomi-\nnantly large (> 200 ms\u22121) spectral widths in the higher lat-\nitude part. The relationship between the spectral width and\nthe red line (630.0 nm) emission measured by the meridian\nscanning photometer is considered. The poleward border of\nthe red line emission, which has, in the past, been proposed\nas being representative of the polar cap boundary, was co-\nlocated to within 1\u25e6 of magnetic latitude with the gradient\nin spectral width for part of the interval. Statistically, large\nspectral widths occurred poleward of the red line emission,\nwhile small spectral widths occurred within or equatorward\nof the red line emission. Near simultaneous DMSP particle\nobservations in the 20 eV to 20 keV range indicate that the\npoleward border of the red line emission and the gradient\nin spectral width occurred at the same latitude as the tran-\nsition from auroral oval to polar rain particle energies. We\nconclude that the large spectral widths were not caused by\nparticle precipitation associated with the auroral oval. There\nwere two periods of special interest when the relationship\nbetween the red line and the spectral width broke down. The\nfirst of these happened during enhanced red line and green\nline (557.7 nm) emission, with a drop out of the radar scatter\nand an enhanced, narrow westward electrojet. We conclude\nthat this event was a magnetospheric substorm occurring at\nmuch higher than usual latitudes. The second period of spe-\ncial interest happened when equatorward moving bands of\nCorrespondence to: M. Lester (mle@ion.le.ac.uk)\nlarge spectral width occurred within the region of scatter.\nUp to 4 of these bands were present during an interval of\n100 minutes. Associated with these narrow bands of large\nspectral width were narrow channels of enhanced westward\nion velocities. We conclude that these equatorward moving\nbands of large spectral width may be related to reconnection\nprocesses in the tail. The observations demonstrate that the\ntail continues to be active even under low solar wind energy\ninput conditions. Furthermore, we conclude that the gradient\nin the spectral width may be used as a proxy for the polar cap\nboundary, but only with extreme caution.\nKey words. Ionosphere (ionosphere-magnetosphere inter-\nactions; polar ionosphere) \u2013 Magnetospheric physics (storms\nand substorms)\n1 Introduction\nThe boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines,\nwhen mapped into the ionosphere, is often termed the polar\ncap boundary. The motion of this boundary, and hence, the\nsize of the polar cap and the amount of open flux in the mag-\nnetosphere, in response to solar wind, interplanetary mag-\nnetic field (IMF) conditions, and magnetospheric substorms\nis a topic of considerable interest. Magnetic reconnection at\nthe dayside magnetopause and in the tail creates and destroys\nthe open magnetic flux and, in so doing, drives a convection\ncycle in the magnetosphere which maps into the ionosphere\n(see e.g. Cowley, 1998, for a review). It is well established\n(e.g. Reiff and Burch, 1985; Cowley, 1998) that the iono-\nspheric convection pattern is controlled by the direction of\nthe IMF. The average convection pattern during IMF Bz neg-\native conditions consists of two cells with antisunward flow\nacross the polar cap and sunward flow at lower latitudes. The\nIMF By component distorts the two cells such that the dusk\ncell (dawn cell) is dominant for positive (negative) By . In\naddition to reconnection, there is evidence of a viscous in-\nteraction which drives flows in the same direction as those\n328 M.

The directions of\nthree of the 16 beams, 4 (eastern), 9 (central) and 13 (western), of\nthe Finland radar are marked by dashed lines. The direction of the\nscan of the meridian scanning photometers at Longyearbyen (full\nline), the locations of five IMAGE magnetometer stations (crosses),\nand the trajectory of the DMSP spacecraft, F12, (thick dashed line)\nare also shown.\ndriven by reconnection, albeit at much weaker levels. This is\nparticularly clear when the IMF has a northward component.\nHowever, during northward IMF, it is also possible for recon-\nnection between the IMF and the tail lobes to take place for\nparticularly favourable orientations of IMF By and Bx . This\nproduces the so-called lobe cells at higher latitudes, where\nthe reconnection site is located poleward of the viscous cells.\nThe effect of the viscous interaction during southward IMF\nBz is to move the centre of the two flow cells to lower lati-\ntudes, thereby displacing the flow reversal boundary (FRB)\nfrom the boundary between open and closed magnetic flux,\ni.e. the polar cap boundary (PCB).\nThe impact of magnetospheric substorms on ionospheric\nconvection is less understood. It is generally accepted that\nopen flux in the tail will be reconnected during the substorm\nprocess, although no quantitative estimate of the percentage\nof the existing open flux that is reconnected has yet been\nmade. Furthermore, as reconnection at the dayside magne-\ntopause is responsible for ionospheric convection on the day-\nside, it might be expected that reconnection in the tail should\nalso drive convection. However, although the current sys-\ntems during magnetospheric substorms are well known (e.g.\nKamide and Kokubun, 1996), the ionospheric flows are less\nunderstood, in particular during the expansion and recovery\nphases (e.g. Lester, 2000). It is clear, however, that sub-\nstorms do result in the contraction of the polar cap boundary\n(e.g. Lockwood et al., 1988; Lester et al., 1990; Taylor et\nal., 1996), which does indicate that open magnetic flux is de-\nstroyed during the substorm process.\nTo gain a quantitative understanding of how the open mag-\nnetic flux in the magnetosphere varies as a function of the\nIMF and substorm activity, it is necessary to be able to follow\nthe location of the PCB at all local times. Currently, there is\nno unambiguous method of doing this. There are many ways\nto locate the FRB using networks of ground-based radars\nsuch as SuperDARN (Greenwald et al., 1995) or networks\nof magnetometers using the AMIE technique (e.g. Taylor et\nal., 1996). However, the FRB and the PCB may not neces-\nsarily be co-located, as mentioned above. The particle dis-\ntributions measured by low earth orbiting spacecraft, such as\nDMSP and FAST, can also be used to identify the boundary\nbetween auroral precipitation and polar rain. This represents\none diagnostic for the PCB (e.g. Newell et al., 1996). There\nare not sufficient spacecraft, however, to provide true global\ncoverage with sufficient temporal resolution. Global images\nof the UV aurora can also be used (e.g. Brittnacher et al.,\n1999), but these too do not always identify the PCB clearly.\nNetworks of meridian scanning photometers could also be\nused since the poleward border of the 630.0 nm (red line)\nauroral emission may be located with the PCB (e.g. Sam-\nson et al., 1992; Blanchard et al., 1995). Such a technique,\nhowever, will only work in darkness.\nIn this paper we investigate the relationship between the\nred line emission and the spectral width parameter of HF\nradar backscatter, as measured by the CUTLASS Finland\nradar. A particular feature in the spectral width is the ex-\nistence of large spectral width values at the poleward side of\na region of scatter, resulting in a latitudinal gradient in the\nspectral width. The purpose is to address the cause of the\nlarge spectral width values and hence, the gradient in order\nto identify potential magnetospheric boundaries associated\nwith this gradient, and to judge whether this feature may be\nused in future as a diagnostic of the PCB. In addition, the\ninterval of interest contains two dynamic features of interest:\na weak substorm expansion occurring at high magnetic lati-\ntudes, and equatorward moving bands of high spectral width\nafter this substorm. These dynamic features will also be dis-\ncussed.\n2 Experimental overview\nCUTLASS consists of two HF radars, one of which is located\nat Hankasalmi, Finland and the other at Pykkvibaer, Iceland\n(Lester et al., 1997). The fields of view overlap from north-\nern Norway to poleward of Svalbard (see Fig. 1). The two\nradars form the eastern most pair of the northern hemisphere\nchain of SuperDARN radars (Greenwald et al., 1995). Each\nradar provides measurements of three basic parameters: the\nbackscatter power, the line of sight velocity, and the spectral\nwidth, in 75 range gates along each of 16 look directions. In\ntheir normal mode of operation, the SuperDARN HF radars\nintegrate for 7 s along each beam direction and scan 16 beam\ndirections successively such that a full scan takes 2 minutes.\nThe line of sight velocities from the overlapping part of the\nM. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission 329\nfields of view of the two radars can be combined to form\nvector velocities in the ionosphere. Alternatively, the line of\nsight velocity measurements from all radars can be combined\nto create maps of the ionospheric potential (Ruohoniemi and\nBaker, 1998). In this paper, however, we concentrate solely\non data from the Finland radar.\nAt Longyearbyen, a meridian scanning photometer oper-\nates at four different wavelengths: 427.8 nm, 486.1 nm, 557.7\nnm and 630.0 nm. In the following analysis we concentrate\non the 630.0 nm (red line) and 557.7 nm (green line) wave-\nlengths. The photometer scans from 0\u25e6 elevation in the north\nto 0\u25e6 elevation in the south in a time interval of 2 seconds,\nwith a repeat cycle of 16 seconds. The scan direction of the\nphotometer is oriented at an azimuth of 45 degrees to geo-\ngraphic north (Fig. 1). Also shown in Fig. 1 are the direc-\ntions of beams 4, 9 and 13 of the CUTLASS Finland radar,\nas well as the locations of five of the IMAGE magnetome-\nter stations (Viljanen and H\u00e4kkinen, 1997) from Ny Alesund\n(NAL) to Kevo (KEV), which have also been used in this\nstudy. A DMSP overpass is employed to determine the loca-\ntions of boundaries in the precipitation and the trajectory of\nthis overpass is indicated in Fig. 1.\n3 Observations\nThe interval of interest is 1850\u20132300 UT on 27 November\n1997. In the top three panels of Fig. 2 we present the IMF\nconditions as measured by the Magnetic Field Instrument,\nMFI, (Lepping et al., 1995) on the WIND spacecraft which\nwas located at (191, \u22128, 28) RE (GSM X, Y and Z co-\nordinates). The interval presented in Fig. 2 extends from\n1700\u20132200 UT. Comparison with IMP-8 data (not shown),\nwhich was located at (6.2, \u221227.4, \u221222.9) RE (GSM co-\nordinates), demonstrates that the IMF measured by the two\nspacecraft at these two different locations is, in general, very\nsimilar. This indicates that the measurements by WIND were\nrepresentative of the conditions which impinged on the mag-\nnetosphere. Also, based upon this comparison, it is estimated\nthat the delay between the measurement at WIND and the\nimpact of the IMF at the dayside magnetopause was approx-\nimately one hour. Thus, the time interval presented in Fig.\n2 is effectively 1800\u20132300 UT at the dayside magnetopause\nand the times quoted below will, from hereon, be the approx-\nimate times at the magnetopause. The IMF Bx component\nwas about +2 nT at the start of the interval and gradually\nchanged to about \u22124 nT at the end, changing sign at \u223c1912\nUT. The By component remained negative throughout the in-\nterval, varying between \u22121 nT and \u22126 nT. Finally, the IMF\nBz component began at \u223c\u22124 nT before becoming weakly\npositive at\u223c1824 UT and remained so until\u223c2136 UT when\nit became+4 nT. During much of the interval of weakly pos-\nitive Bz, the By component was of the order of twice the Bz\ncomponent. The solar wind velocity (Fig. 2, panel 4) mea-\nsured by the Solar Wind Experiment, SWE, (Ogilvie et al.,\n1995) began at about 340 km s\u22121 and gradually increased\nto about 360 km s\u22121 over the interval. The solar wind den-\nFig. 2. Wind measurements of the IMF and solar wind velocity and\ndensity for the interval 17\u201322 UT on 27 November 1997.\nsity (Fig. 2, bottom panel), also measured by SWE, varied\nbetween 4 cm\u22123 and 6 cm3.\nBefore moving to the radar and optical observations, we\npresent the magnetometer data from the northernmost sta-\ntions of the IMAGE array in Fig. 3a (X component) and Fig.\n3b (Z component). The locations of the stations relative to\nthe radar field of view and the MSP meridian are given in\nFig. 1. We only present these stations as the stations at lower\nlatitudes show small variations which are not dissimilar from\nthose at KEV. There was a clear negative excursion of the X\n(north-south) component at 1917 UT (dashed vertical line),\nwhich maximised at HOP where the deflection was of or-\nder 120 nT. Weaker negative excursions in the X component\nalso occurred at LYR, HOR and BJN. There is evidence of\nsome form of recovery at \u223c1932 UT, although another neg-\native excursion was then seen at 1939 UT (dashed vertical\nline). At 1955 UT (dashed vertical line), the X component\nat all stations appeared to have recovered to the levels ob-\nserved before 1917 UT, where, at such time, the Z (vertical)\ncomponent had positive deflections at NAL, LYR and HOR,\nwhile at HOP, the deflection was initially positive before os-\ncillating quite strongly between positive and negative. At\nBJN, the initial deflection was negative at 1917 UT. These\nobservations are consistent with an enhanced westward elec-\ntrojet which is centred near HOR (73.9\u25e6 magnetic latitude)\n330 M.

The dashed vertical lines identify times of interest.\nand extends to BJN (71.2\u25e6 magnetic latitude) in the south\nand at least NAL (76\u25e6 magnetic latitude) in the north. This\nis a fairly weak electrojet when compared with electrojets\nobserved during typical substorm expansion phases on the\nIMAGE array (e.g. Lester et al., 1995; Fox et al., 1999). We\nreturn to this magnetic activity later in the discussion.\nIn Fig. 4 we present the observations along beam 9 of\nCUTLASS Finland of the three main radar parameters: back-\nscatter power, line of sight velocity and spectral width (top\nthree panels) as a function of magnetic latitude and UT. The\ninterval 1800\u20132300 UT is equivalent to \u223c2000\u20130100 MLT\nfor this beam. The intensity of the 630.0 and 557.7 nm emis-\nsions from the Longyearbyen MSP are plotted in Fig. 4\u2019s\nbottom two panels, as a function of zenith angle and UT.\nThe radar data have been taken from beam 9 since this beam\npasses over Longyearbyen at 74.9\u25e6 magnetic latitude. The\ntop three panels indicate that radar backscatter first appeared\njust before 1850 UT and was present for most of the remain-\nder of the interval, apart from a short period between 1912\nand 1920 UT, which we will discuss later. The backscatter\ninitially extended over the region 68\u201376\u25e6 magnetic latitude,\nalthough this latitudinal extent was reduced by the end of the\ninterval. The line of sight velocities were, in general, small\nand positive (towards the radar), apart from three intervals,\nwhich start at 1930, 1942 and 1950 UT, when there are larger\npositive velocities at the poleward limit of the backscatter.\nIn the spectral width measurements (Fig. 4, panel 3), there\nwas a well defined boundary between small spectral widths\nin the equatorward part of the backscatter and larger spectral\nwidths in the poleward part of the backscatter. This bound-\nary between the two types started at about 72\u25e6 magnetic lat-\nitude, when the backscatter was first observed at 1850 UT,\nand moved gradually poleward until the loss of backscatter\noccurred on beam 9 on the scan, starting at 1914 UT. When\nthe scatter returned, large spectral widths existed at almost\nall latitudes until about 1935 UT, when the boundary was re-\nestablished near 71\u25e6 magnetic latitude. Thereafter, there was\na poleward motion to 72\u25e6 magnetic latitude until about 1945\nUT. This boundary remained at that latitude until about 2005\nUT, when it began to move equatorward, eventually reaching\n69.5\u25e6 magnetic latitude just before 2040 UT. There followed\na number of bands of large spectral width which moved equa-\ntorward at approximately similar rates, i.e. \u223c2\u25e6 of magnetic\nlatitude in 20 minutes, equivalent to\u223c200 m s\u22121. On beam 9,\nthere were three clear examples of these bands, starting at the\napproximate times of 2020 UT, 2110 UT and 2135 UT, with\na further possible event at 2045 UT. The minimum magnetic\nlatitude to which these bands propagated was 69.5\u25e6. After\n2200 UT, the boundary remained near 70\u25e6 magnetic latitude\nuntil about 2240 UT, when it started to move poleward again,\nM.

Backscatter power, line of sight velocity and spectral width\nfrom beam 9 of CUTLASS Finland, as a function of latitude for\nthe interval 18\u201323 UT on 27 November 1997. Also plotted are the\n630.0 nm emission intensity and the 557.7 nm emission intensity as\na function of zenith angle from 0\u25e6 to \u221290\u25e6 for the same interval.\nThe full line marked on each panel of the radar data represents the\npoleward 1.5 kR contour of the 630.0 nm emission (see text for full\ndiscussion).\nreaching 71\u25e6 magnetic latitude at 2300 UT.\nMoving to the MSP data we start with the 630.0 nm emis-\nsion (Fig. 4, panel 4), which is plotted from 0\u25e6 zenith angle\nto \u221290\u25e6 zenith angle, i.e. from the zenith to the southeast\nof Svalbard. Between 1800 and 1845 UT the emission is\ngenerally fairly weak, with a narrow band of higher inten-\nsity emission between 1.0 and 1.5 kR, centred at about \u221260\u25e6\nzenith angle. At\u223c1845 UT, there was a small increase in the\nintensity of the emission which was coincident with the on-\nset of the radar backscatter. Then at \u223c1900 UT, there was a\nfurther brightening of the red line emission which lead to an\nextension of the zenith angle coverage to between \u221250\u25e6 and\n\u221270\u25e6, although still centred at the same latitude. At 1920\nUT, there was an enhancement in the emission intensity to\ngreater than 4.5 kR as well as an expansion in extent of the\nFig. 5.

The full line marked on each panel of the radar data\nrepresents the poleward 1.5 kR contour of the 630.0 nm emission\n(see text for full discussion).\nemission region to between \u221220 and \u221290\u25e6 zenith angle. We\ninterpret this as a result of the onset of the substorm expan-\nsion phase, identified by the enhanced electrojet observed by\nthe IMAGE magnetometers (see later discussion). By 1930\nUT, the emission intensity had started to decrease, although\nthere was another enhancement between 1940 and 1950 UT.\nThereafter, the emission intensity declined to the level, loca-\ntion and extent present before 1920 UT. There were further\nincreases in emission intensity near 2040, 2120 and 2140 UT.\nAfter this time, there was considerable structure in the red\nline emission, which, although not increasing in intensity, did\nincrease in extent. After 2200 UT, the red line began to fade\nagain to values less than 1.5 kR.\nThe green line (557.7 nm) emission (Fig. 4, bottom panel),\nwhich is plotted in the same format as the red line emission,\nexhibited much the same behaviour as the red line emis-\nsion. The intensity of the emission was stronger, exceed-\ning 9 kR during the intervals of more intense emission, as\nwell as exhibiting a further enhancement in emission inten-\nsity after 1950 UT, albeit over a much narrower latitudinal\nregion. Furthermore, just prior to the major enhancement at\n1920 UT, there was a narrow region of strong emission near\n332 M. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission\n\u221275\u25e6 zenith angle that began at about 1912 UT, which coin-\ncided with the loss of radar backscatter on beam 9. Following\n2020 UT, there were enhancements in the green line intensity\nnear \u221275\u25e6 zenith angle, which exceeded 8 kR and one much\nweaker enhancement near 2140 UT. Apart from a short inter-\nval of relatively weak emission between 2140 and 2200 UT,\nthere was little green line emission after 2125 UT.\nReturning to the radar data, in Fig. 5 we present the ve-\nlocity and spectral width for beams 4 (top two panels) and\n13 (bottom two panels) in order to illustrate a number of\nfeatures. First, by inspection of the velocity data, we note\nthat for most of the interval the velocities measured along\nbeam 4 were negative, away from the radar, with some pos-\nitive values at the higher latitudes. Along beam 13, the op-\nposite was true, with mainly positive values but also with a\nfew negative values at higher latitudes. These measurements\nare consistent with a dominant westward (or sunward) flow\ndirection at the lower latitudes and an eastward (or antisun-\nward) flow direction at the higher latitudes. This conclusion\nhas been confirmed by a beam swinging analysis of the radar\ndata. The second feature is that the spectral width behaved\nin essentially the same way on beams 4 and 13, as it did on\nbeam 9. Indeed, inspection of all the beams demonstrates this\nbehaviour, although the latitude of the boundary does differ\nslightly from beam to beam. Finally, we note that there was\nno loss of scatter on beam 13 at about 1912 UT, as on beams\n4 and 9. Indeed, the four eastern most beams did not lose\nscatter at this time.\n4 Discussion\nTo summarise the observations, the interval under discussion\nis one during which IMF Bz was mainly weakly positive with\na negativeBy and |By | > |Bz|. The solar wind dynamic pres-\nsure varied weakly and was typically\u223c1 nPa. There are three\nfeatures in the magnetometer, radar and optical data which\nare of special interest: the substorm-like features observed\nin the magnetometer and optical data at high latitudes, the\nboundary in the spectral width, and the equatorward moving\nbands of spectral width. We begin by discussing the substorm\nfeatures, before moving to the boundary in the spectral width\nand finally, the equatorward moving bands of large spectral\nwidth.\n4.1 High-latitude substorm onset\nIt is well established that the onset of the expansion phase\nof a magnetospheric substorm is identified by an auroral sig-\nnature and a magnetic signature (e.g. Akasofu, 1968). In\nthe Scandinavian sector these signatures normally occur at\nmagnetic latitudes of 65\u201367\u25e6, before a poleward expansion\ntakes place (e.g. Lester et al., 1995; Fox et al., 1999). The\nmain magnetic signature results from an enhanced westward\nelectrojet which is generally co-located with the optical lumi-\nnosity and thus, enhanced E-region conductivity. At \u223c1917\nUT, there is clear evidence in the magnetometer stations of\na weak, but well defined westward electrojet (Fig. 3). The\nrelevant signatures are a negative deflection in the X compo-\nnent and a negative (positive) deflection in the Z component\nof the stations equatorward (poleward) of the electrojet cen-\ntre. Such signatures are clearly defined in Fig. 3, between\n1917 and 1955 UT, with the electrojet centre occurring near\nHOR at 73.9\u25e6 magnetic latitude. At the same time, there was\nan initial enhancement of the equatorward most auroral arc\nwhich was followed by a rapid poleward expansion of the au-\nrora. Close inspection of the 557.7 nm emission data (Fig. 4,\nbottom panel) indicate that there was an initial enhancement\nat \u223c1912 UT of the equatorward most auroral form and a\nsubsequent rapid poleward motion at \u223c1918 UT. If we as-\nsume an altitude of 110 km at which the green line emission\nmaximises, then the latitude of the initial onset is 71\u25e6 mag-\nnetic latitude and the aurora subsequently expands poleward\nto a maximum latitude of about 74\u25e6 magnetic latitude. The\njustification for the altitude of emission is given later in Sect.\n4.2.1. Note also that the intensification in the red and green\nlines at \u223c1939 UT was accompanied by an intensification of\nthe electrojet, as indicated by the perturbation in the X and\nZ components of the magnetic field (Fig. 3).\nThus, we have two well defined signatures which suggest a\nsubstorm expansion phase onset, albeit at high latitudes and\nfollowing a period of about 50 minutes when the IMF Bz\ncomponent had been predominantly northward with a short\n10 minute interval of southward IMF. Other signatures gener-\nally associated with the onset of the expansion phase include\nmid latitude Pi2 pulsations and energetic particle injections\nat geosynchronous orbit. Investigation of the available data\nsets indicates that neither of these was observed. This does\nnot mean, however, that the signatures reported here are not\nof a magnetospheric substorm. The latitude of the auroral\nbreak up suggests that the geosynchronous signature would\nnot necessarily be expected. A simple mapping of the mag-\nnetic field using the T89 model (Tsygenenko, 1990) from 71\u25e6\nmagnetic latitude for quiet magnetic conditions (Kp = 0)\ncompared with one from 66\u25e6 magnetic latitude for moder-\nately disturbed conditions (Kp = 2) demonstrates this point.\nIn the former case, the field maps to a position\u223c17 RE down\ntail, while in the latter, the field line maps to \u223c6.6 RE down\ntail. If the mapping is correct and the onset did occur at such\na large distance in the tail, it seems unlikely that any parti-\ncle injection signatures would have reached geosynchronous\norbit. Often, during the growth phase of magnetospheric sub-\nstorms, pseudo break-ups occur, which have many of the sig-\nnatures of the expansion phase onset but which are localised\nin extent (e.g. Lester et al., 1998). The major difference\nbetween the two is that the rapid poleward expansion of the\nauroral activity, which occurs at expansion phase onset, does\nnot occur at the time of a pseudo break-up. A rapid poleward\nmotion of the aurora did occur during the event under discus-\nsion and we conclude that the event is a weak substorm ex-\npansion phase occurring at high latitudes following an inter-\nval of weak energy storage. Small magnetospheric substorms\nduring intervals of northward IMFBz have been discussed by\na number of authors (e.g. Nishida, 1971; Petrukovich et al.,\nM. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission 333\n2000) and are found to occur on a contracted auroral oval\n(Akasofu et al., 1973). Craven and Frank (1991), in a study\nof some 68 expansion phase onsets observed by the imager\non DE-1 from a five month interval, found the location of on-\nset varied between 59 and 72\u25e6 magnetic latitude, with a me-\ndian value of 65\u25e6 magnetic latitude. Note that these events\nhad been selected such that the auroral bulge was of limited\nextent and that there were sufficient images to identify the\ncontinuing substorm development. Despite the possibility of\nselection effects, the study of Craven and Frank does suggest\nthat substorms with onsets at the latitudes of 71\u25e6 are infre-\nquent.\nThe onset of the substorm resulted in an initial drop out of\nradar scatter at 1912 UT which was then followed by a bite\nout of scatter at about 1922 UT, after the scatter had returned\nat 1917 UT. This behaviour has been reported before by Yeo-\nman et al. (2000), who suggested that the initial drop out of\nscatter is caused by the brightening of the arc which results in\nthe flow stagnating poleward of the arc. This stagnation re-\nsults in the electric field going to zero, which, in turn, leads to\nthe disappearance of the backscatter (Milan et al., 1999). The\nscatter then returns after the flow has re-oriented such that it\navoids the obstacle of the high conductivity region associated\nwith the brightening of the auroral arc. The resulting bite out\nin the scatter is then associated with the poleward expansion\nof the auroral activity. Some of the HF signals, probably\nthe high angle rays, are absorbed by the enhanced E-region\nand possibly D-region electron densities associated with this\nlarger region of auroral activity (Yeoman et al., 2000).\n4.2 High spectral width boundary\nWe move now to discuss the boundary in the spectral width\nobservations and, in particular, the cause of the large spec-\ntral widths at the high latitude part of the field of view, and\nwhether the boundary is of geophysical significance in re-\nlation to a magnetospheric boundary. Large spectral widths\nin HF radar backscatter were first discussed in association\nwith the footprint of the ionospheric cusp (Baker et al., 1990,\n1995). No specific reason for the large spectral width was\ngiven at the time, although Baker et al. (1995) did sug-\ngest that the spectra resulted from a variety of both tempo-\nral and spatial behaviour within the cusp region. Certainly\nthere was evidence from coincident DMSP passes that both\nvariable electric fields and particle precipitation were present\nin range gates where the spectra were large. Subsequent ob-\nservations of large spectral width on the nightside were re-\nported by Lewis et al., 1997 and Dudeney et al., 1998. In the\nexample discussed by Dudeney et al. (1998), the boundary\nbetween small and large spectral width was seen to straddle\nthe boundary between the central plasma sheet (CPS) and the\nboundary plasma sheet (BPS). Thus, the large spectral width\nregion was related to the boundary plasma sheet. More re-\ncently, however, Andr\u00e9 et al. (1999, 2000) have suggested an\nalternative cause for the large spectral width associated with\nthe cusp. These authors propose that the spectral width is a\nresult of the electric fields associated with ULF wave activity\nin the cusp area modifying the spectra, or more exactly, the\nradar autocorrelation function.\n4.2.1 Polar cap boundary definition\nIt has been suggested that the poleward border of the red line\nemission is co-located with the polar cap boundary, i.e. the\nboundary between open and closed magnetic flux (Samson et\nal., 1992; Blanchard et al., 1995). Samson et al. (1992) iden-\ntified the poleward border of the red line emission with the\nequatorward boundary of the polar rain based upon simulta-\nneous DMSP electron measurements, which they assume to\nbe the boundary between open and closed field lines. Blan-\nchard et al. (1995) looked at this suggestion in some detail\nand concluded that the red line emission could be used as a\ngood monitor for the polar cap boundary. It is clear from their\nmeasurements, however, that there are several times when\nthe co-location is not as good as their suggested precision of\n\u00b10.9\u25e6 invariant latitude. This is particularly the case when\nthe nightside auroral oval is dynamic, e.g. during the expan-\nsion phase of a substorm, suggesting therefore, that under\nthese conditions, the red line emission is not a good proxy\nfor the polar cap boundary.\nIn order to undertake a direct comparison between the spec-\ntral width and the MSP data, the latter needs to be trans-\nformed into magnetic latitude co-ordinates. This is not, how-\never, a trivial task, as the optical emission can come from a\nrange of altitudes and therefore, assuming a single altitude of\nemission is not always correct. The red line emission is par-\nticularly difficult as it can come from altitudes between 200\nand 500 km, with the altitude of the peak emission normally\nexpected to be near 250 km. The green line emission comes\nfrom a much narrower height range, \u223c100\u2013120 km, with the\npeak emission at \u223c110 km. Careful investigation of the op-\ntical data, including all sky camera data not shown, indicates\nthat there were two discrete, narrow, \u223c10 km wide, auroral\nfeatures equatorward of Longyearbyen for most of the inter-\nval, although not during the substorm expansion phase. For\ncertain times the latitude of the lower border of the poleward\nmost auroral form can be compared with the latitude of the\npoleward border of the red line, assuming a uniform height\nof 250 km for the emission. At these times, the difference\nbetween the two latitudes is a fraction of a degree, which is\nof the order of the length of a radar range gate, 45 km. As\nthe difference is small for certain times, we have calculated\nthe poleward boundary of the red line emission assuming a\nuniform altitude of emission of 250 km. Assuming then an\naltitude of emission for the green line of 110 km, there is ex-\ncellent agreement in the latitudes of the red and green line\nemissions, which further supports the general use during this\ninterval of the single altitude of emission for the red line.\nThe poleward border is, in fact, the 1.5 kR contour and\nthis has been overlaid on the radar data in Figs. 4 and 5. This\ncontour is well defined and inspection of the data indicates\nthat the gradient of the emission intensity is such that the\nactual value employed is not important. The location of the\ncontour was close to 72\u25e6 magnetic latitude between 1845 and\n334 M. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission\n1920 UT before jumping poleward to 74\u25e6 magnetic latitude\nat the time of the enhancement in emission. Thereafter, the\ncontour remained between 73 and 74\u25e6 magnetic latitude un-\ntil 1950 UT, whereupon it moved steadily equatorward over\nthe next 30\u201340 minutes, reaching 71\u25e6 magnetic latitude. An-\nother poleward jump to just over 72\u25e6 magnetic latitude took\nplace at about 2030 UT after which, this contour remained\napproximately at the same latitude until 2115 UT. This was\nfollowed by a short interval when the contour varied some-\nwhat before a poleward jump to 73\u25e6 magnetic latitude at 2135\nUT, where it remained for 15 minutes before moving equa-\ntorward to 71\u25e6 magnetic latitude at 2200 UT. After 2200 UT,\nthe red line emission was in general less than 1.5 kR.\n4.2.2 Polar cap boundary and spectral width\nComparing the 1.5 kR contour with the spectral width data\nin the central panel of Fig. 4, we see that at the start of the\ninterval the 1.5 kR contour and the boundary between large\nand small spectral widths agreed to within one degree for\nthe first 12 minutes. After the scatter returned at 1920 UT,\nthe two boundaries did not agree. When the 1.5 kR contour\nbegan to move equatorward at about 2000 UT, however, there\nwas, in general, good agreement between the two boundaries,\nuntil the second poleward jump of the 1.5 kR contour at 2030\nUT. Thereafter, there was again a discrepancy between the\nlatitude of the poleward border of the red line and that of\nthe gradient in the spectral width. Close inspection of the\nspectral width data suggests that the difference was caused by\nequatorward moving bands of large spectral width, such that\nthere were regions of smaller spectral width just equatorward\nof the 1.5 kR contour. The highest latitude of these regions\nof small spectral width does appear to agree reasonably well\nwith the 1.5 kR contour.\nThe location of the poleward border of the red line emis-\nsion was quantified by Blanchard et al. (1995) by fitting a\nstep function in latitude to the emission measurements, as-\nsuming approximately constant emission levels in the polar\ncap and in the auroral oval. Although this method differs\nsomewhat from the simple use of the 1.5 kR contour, careful\ninvestigation of the emission profile with latitude indicates\nthat both methods result in similar locations for the interval\ndiscussed here. In addition, Fig. 4 demonstrates that the\nemission intensity was not constant with latitude within the\nauroral oval. We can extend the analysis discussed earlier\nby considering the occurrence frequency of spectral width\npoleward and equatorward of the 1.5 kR contour. Figure 6\npresents the occurrence distribution for these two regions of\nscatter in bins of 50 m s\u22121, poleward of the 1.5 kR contour\nin the top panel and equatorward of the contour in the bot-\ntom panel. Note that in the bottom panel, the distribution\npoleward of the contour is overlaid (Fig. 6, lower panel, thin\nline). The distributions are calculated for the interval 1845\u2013\n2300 UT and if the poleward 1.5 kR contour in the red line\nemission was not present, the radar data would not have been\nincluded. The boundary is assumed to have been at a con-\nstant latitude over the whole radar field of view in order that\nFig. 6. Occurrence histograms of spectral width poleward of the 1.5\nkR contour (upper panel) and equatorward of the 1.5 kR contour\n(lower panel, thick line). Note the distribution from the upper panel\nis overlaid in the lower panel as a thin line.\nwe can include data from all 16 beams. The distribution of\nspectral width poleward of the 1.5 kR contour (Fig. 6, up-\nper panel) peaks in the 250\u2013300 m s\u22121 bin, at 13% of the\ndistribution. If we consider 200 m s\u22121 as representative of\nthe boundary between small and large spectral widths, we\nfind that 70% of the distribution had spectral widths > 200\nm s\u22121. The occurrence distribution of spectral width equa-\nM. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission 335\ntorward of the 1.5 kR contour (Fig. 6, lower panel, thick\nline) is very different. The peak spectral width occurrence\nfrequency is between 0 and 50 m s\u22121, with 31% of the dis-\ntribution; 72% of the distribution had a spectral width which\nis < 200 m s\u22121. These distributions indicate that there was\na significant relationship between the 1.5 kR contour and the\nspectral width parameter. Note that the two distributions in\nFig. 6 do not change shape if a different time interval or con-\ntour of red line intensity is chosen. The percentages above\nand below the threshold value of 200 m s\u22121 do change, but\noverall, \u223c70% of each distribution is larger or smaller than\n200 m s\u22121 poleward or equatorward of the 1.5 kR contour,\nrespectively.\n4.2.3 Polar cap boundary and flow reversal boundary\nComparison with the radar line of sight velocity measure-\nments can also be made. However, beam 9 is not ideal to\nundertake such a comparison as it points almost along a mag-\nnetic meridian and hence, the velocity measurements will, in\ngeneral, be small if the flow is primarily eastwards or west-\nwards. Therefore, we undertake the same process with two\nbeams, 4 and 13, which point to the west and east of beam 9,\nrespectively, and are, therefore, at an angle to the meridian.\nThe line of sight velocity and spectral width measurements\nfor beam 4 (top two panels) and beam 12 (bottom two pan-\nels) are given in Fig. 5. If we consider the velocity mea-\nsurements along beam 4 first, we note that initially the 1.5\nkR contour was coincident with a boundary between positive\nvelocities in the poleward part of the scatter region and neg-\native velocities in the equatorward part of the scatter region,\nwhich is equivalent to the FRB. When backscatter returned\nat 1920 UT, there was limited scatter poleward of the 1.5 kR\ncontour, but equatorward of this, all velocities were negative.\nBetween 1945 and 1955 UT, the 1.5 kR contour is close to\nthe same latitude as the boundary between positive and neg-\native velocities, although the two boundaries are moving in\ndifferent directions and can differ by 2 degrees of magnetic\nlatitude. From 2005 UT until 2025 UT, however, there were\npositive velocities poleward of the 1.5 kR contour as this con-\ntour moved equatorward. After 2025 UT, there was a brief\nperiod when the two boundaries were again in close agree-\nment and from 2045 UT onwards there was little scatter pole-\nward of the 1.5 kR contour; all velocities equatorward of this\ncontour were negative. Comparison with the spectral width\nmeasurements on beam 4 (Fig. 5, second panel) indicates\nsimilar results to those discussed for beam 9. The separation\nof two regions of large spectral width by a region of small\nspectral width after 2020 UT, as a result of the equatorward\nmoving bands of high spectral width, is confirmed with this\nparticular beam. Moving to the beam 13 measurements (Fig.\n5, bottom two panels), equatorward of the 1.5 kR contour the\nline of sight velocity was predominantly positive, while the\nonly negative velocity measurements were poleward of this\ncontour between 1940 and 2030 UT, near 2110 UT and be-\ntween 2140 and 2200 UT. The spectral width measurements,\nhowever, do demonstrate a well defined boundary which be-\nhaved very similarly to that in beams 4 and 9. Finally, we\nnote that coincident with the intervals of equatorward mov-\ning regions of large spectral widths, there were regions of\nlarger line of sight velocities, positive in beam 13 and nega-\ntive in beam 4. These larger line of sight velocities occurred\nwithin a narrow region of typically 1\u20132\u25e6 of magnetic latitude.\n4.2.4 High spectral width and particle precipitation\nBefore discussing the relationship between the red line emis-\nsion and the spectral width and flow reversal boundary, we\nneed to assess the relationship between the red line emis-\nsion and the polar cap boundary. In terms of electron pre-\ncipitation signatures, the boundary between open and closed\nfield lines can be considered to be equivalent to the boundary\nbetween the polar rain and precipitation from the boundary\nplasma sheet. The polar rain is characterised by a weak elec-\ntron flux with an average energy of 100 eV (Hardy et al.,\n1986), while precipitation associated with the plasma sheet\nis characterised by more intense and more energetic electron\nprecipitation (Winningham et al., 1975). The exact mapping\nbetween the auroral oval and the boundary plasma sheet is\nsubject to continuing debate (e.g. Galperin and Feldstein,\n1991). This debate, however, need not concern us here as we\nare only interested in the poleward boundary of the auroral\noval, which we associate with the polar cap boundary or the\nboundary between open and closed field lines. The red line\nemission in the nightside auroral oval is generally believed to\nresult from precipitating electrons of energies \u2264 1 keV. This\nis due to a combination of the effect of the long lifetime of\nthe singlet D upper state and the cross section for excitation.\nGiven the average energies and particle fluxes, it is, therefore,\nreasonable to assume that the red line emission would map\nto boundary plasma sheet rather than polar rain, i.e. closed\nmagnetic field lines.\nThe latitudinal gradient in the spectral width on the night-\nside has been discussed before (Lewis et al., 1997; Dudeney\net al., 1998). In these two studies the gradient in the spectral\nwidth appeared to straddle the boundary between the central\nplasma sheet and the boundary plasma sheet. In the study\nby Dudeney et al. (1998), a comparison of radar spectra\nwas made with coincident data from the Polar Hydra instru-\nment which measures electrons and ions in the 20 eV to 10\nkeV energy range. Lewis et al. (1997) noted that the re-\ngion of scatter, within which there was a gradient in spectral\nwidth, corresponded to a region of magnetospheric precip-\nitation near the boundary plasma sheet and central plasma\nsheet. The DMSP spacecraft provides an excellent data set\nof particle measurements from which estimates of the pole-\nward boundary of the oval can be made (e.g. Hardy et al.,\n1986). While there are no DMSP passes through the radar\nfield of view during the interval of radar scatter, one space-\ncraft passed through, just prior to the interval of scatter. The\nion and electron spectrograms in the energy range 20 eV to\n30 keV measured by F12 are given in Fig. 7. These data\nare taken from a pass through the radar field of view be-\ntween \u223c1841 and 1846 UT, just prior to the onset of radar\n336 M.

The pass is used to demonstrate the nature\nof the precipitation within the oval and how the boundary\nmay be determined. The spacecraft, moving polewards, en-\ncountered ion precipitation with average energy \u223c30 keV at\n1841:30 UT before the electron precipitation of average en-\nergy 1\u20135 keV at 1841:45 UT. The ion precipitation gradually\ndecreased in energy as F12 moved poleward until \u223c1842:25\nUT when the ion precipitation ceased. The electron flux in-\ncreased by an order of magnitude at\u223c1842:12 UT, and there-\nafter, although varying gradually increased until \u223c1842:53\nUT when there was a rapid drop in both flux and average en-\nergy. This rapid decrease has been identified as the poleward\nboundary of the main auroral oval (Newell et al., 1996). The\nspacecraft finally exited the electron precipitation at 1843:04\nUT, which is the poleward boundary of the subvisual driz-\nzle, which differs from polar rain (Newell et al., 1996). Note\nthat as well as the increasing flux, the average energy of the\nelectrons peaked at \u223c 4\u20136 keV prior to 1842:51 UT.\nBased upon these times and converting the geographic co-\nordinates to altitude adjusted corrected geomagnetic coordi-\nnates, AACGM, (Baker and Wing, 1989), we note that the\ninitial drop in electron flux and average energy at \u223c1842:53\nUT occurred at 71.6\u25e6 magnetic latitude, while the final re-\nduction in electron flux occurred at 71.9\u25e6 magnetic latitude.\nAt the start of the radar backscatter,\u223c1848 UT, the poleward\nborder of the red line emission was \u223c71.9\u25e6 magnetic lati-\ntude, while the boundary in the spectral width was at \u223c72.6\u25e6\nmagnetic latitude.\nBased upon the observations of radar spectral width dis-\ncussed above, the high spectral width region mapped to po-\nlar rain type precipitation while the low spectral width region\nmapped to plasma sheet precipitation. Here, we do not dis-\ntinguish between central plasma sheet or boundary plasma\nsheet. The low spectral width region is associated with the\nauroral emission in both red and green lines, which occur at\ndifferent altitudes. In general, the behaviour of the green line\nwas similar to the red line. Therefore, the low spectral width\nmapped to the region where the ionospheric electron density\ndistribution was most likely to be more structured due to par-\nticle precipitation.\nIn summary, on average, low spectral widths were asso-\nciated with the auroral luminosity in both the red and green\nlines and precipitation with average energy of a few keV. The\nlarge spectral widths, however, were associated with low au-\nroral luminosity and precipitation characteristic of the polar\ncap, i.e. polar rain. Furthermore, the motion of the pole-\nward border of the red line with time mirrored the motion of\nthe gradient in the spectral width. Based on these observa-\ntions, we conclude that particle precipitation associated with\nM. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission 337\nthe auroral luminosity is not the cause of the large spectral\nwidth. This disagrees with the previous reported observa-\ntions of the gradient in spectral width (Lewis et al., 1997;\nDudeney et al., 1998). There were, however, three intervals\nwhen the collocation of the poleward border of the auroral lu-\nminosity and the gradient in the spectral width broke down:\nduring the substorm, during the equatorward moving bands,\nand after 2200 UT when the luminosity went to low levels.\n4.3 Equatorward moving bands\nWe finish the discussion with a further investigation of the\nequatorward moving bands. Figure 8 presents the line of\nsight velocity (top panels) and the spectral width (lower pan-\nels) for two consecutive scans starting at 2032 UT and 2034\nUT. The data are plotted in magnetic local time-magnetic\nlatitude coordinates. Magnetic midnight is at the bottom of\neach panel. Overlaid on each panel is the statistical Feldstein\noval for Kp = 0 (Feldstein and Starkov, 1967; Holzworth\nand Meng, 1975). We see that there was a narrow region of\nlarge spectral width embedded within a region of low spec-\ntral width. This narrow region of large spectral width was\napproximately aligned with the poleward border of the sta-\ntistical oval. Also aligned along this border was a narrow\nchannel of high flow velocities, negative in the west and pos-\nitive in the east, and thus, consistent with an overall westward\nflow at that time.\nEquatorward moving arcs on the nightside are a common\nphenomenon during the growth phase and even early expan-\nsion phase of magnetospheric substorms (Persson et al., 1994;\nGazey et al., 1995). Similar features in the ion velocity have\nbeen reported by Lester et al. (1995) in the early expansion\nphase. However, there is no indication of any substorm ac-\ntivity during or following these observations. Other inten-\nsifications at the poleward edge of the auroral oval during\nquiet intervals have been discussed by de la Beaujardi\u00e8re et\nal. (1994). In this study intensifications of the poleward\nmost arc were found to occur every 10\u201320 minutes associ-\nated with the formation of a new arc poleward of the former.\nFurthermore, once every hour or so, stronger intensifications\noccurred which drifted equatorward at \u223c270 m s\u22121. The lo-\ncal plasma velocity doubled in value and a reversal in the\neast-west component formed. This disturbance moved west-\nward at 900 m s\u22121 through the Sondrestrom and Goose Bay\nradar fields of view. In one instance, a simultaneous obser-\nvation of a velocity dispersed ion signature at a low altitude\nspacecraft was observed. The conclusion reached by de la\nBeaujardiere et al. was that these features were related to a\nlocal increase in the reconnection rate in the tail. These ob-\nservations are in agreement with predictions of the so-called\nexpanding contracting polar cap model for the generation of\nionospheric flows (Cowley and Lockwood, 1992).\nComparing the observations reported here throughout the\ninterval of equatorward moving bands, the IMF Bz compo-\nnent varied between 0 and 2 nT, while By was \u22125 nT apart\nfrom a brief 15 minute interval when Bz was +5 nT and By\n\u22121 nT. During the interval reported by de la Beaujardi\u00e9re\nFig. 8. Full radar scans of line of sight velocity (top panels) and\nspectral width (bottom two panels) for scans starting at 2032 UT and\n2034 UT. The coordinate system is magnetic local time\/magnetic\nlatitude based upon the AAGCM coordinates of Baker and Wing\n(1989).\net al. (1994), however, the Bx component was the domi-\nnant IMF component which is not the case in the interval\ndiscussed here. We note a number of similarities between\nthe two intervals, e.g. the generally quiet global magnetic\nconditions, the equatorward drift, the repetition rate and the\nchannel of enhanced westward flow. We note, also, that there\nwere regions of strong equatorward flow embedded within\nthe weaker flow poleward of the FRB in both radar scans\npresented in Fig. 8. In the first, there was a region in the\ncentre of the field of view, near 23 MLT and 75\u25e6 magnetic\nlatitude, as well as one in the eastern part of the field of view\nnear 24 MLT and 72\u25e6 magnetic latitude. The former lasted\nfor only one scan, while the latter was present for a longer\ntime period. Such features are consistent with the observa-\ntions of de la Beaujardi\u00e9re et al. (1994) who also noted en-\nhanced equatorward flow. If the poleward border of the red\nline emission does represent the polar cap boundary, then this\nis the ionospheric footprint of the last closed field line in the\ntail. Hence, this is the most likely site for reconnection at the\ndistant neutral line to be taking place.\n5 Conclusions\nIn summary, we find that in this particular case study there\nis evidence that a gradient in spectral width is related to the\nPCB, with large spectral widths co-located with polar rain\nelectron precipitation poleward of the PCB. As the particle\nprecipitation associated with the large spectral widths is of\npolar rain levels, it is unlikely that structured electron pre-\ncipitation plays a role in the formation of these large spectral\nwidths, as proposed by Lewis et al. (1997) and Dudeney et\nal. (1998). In this case, therefore, some alternative explana-\n338 M. Lester et al.: HF radar spectra and 630.0 nm auroral emission\ntion of the large spectral widths is needed. It is likely that the\nrecent work of Andr\u00e9 et al. (1999, 2000) will provide such\nan explanation.\nThe relationship between the spectral width gradient and\nthe auroral luminosity was, however, complicated by dynam-\nical features. The first was a magnetospheric substorm which\noccurred at higher than usual magnetic latitudes. The second\nwas related to equatorward moving bands of large spectral\nwidth. The substorm occurred immediately following an in-\nterval of weak energy input to the magnetosphere, as charac-\nterised by the IMF and solar wind conditions, although weak\nthis event does indicate that such bursts of activity can occur\nduring such solar wind conditions. The equatorward mov-\ning bands are also intriguing and we conclude that they may\nhave been caused by time dependent reconnection at a distant\nneutral line following the substorm onset. This study illus-\ntrates the complexity of the polar cap during quiet conditions.\nThere was evidence for both substorm activity and continued\nbursts of reconnection at the polar cap boundary. The mag-\nnetosphere ionosphere system does not remain stable under\nsuch weakly northward IMF conditions.\nWe conclude finally that the gradient in the spectral width\nmay be used as a proxy for the PCB, but only with extreme\ncare. Dynamical features can clearly cause some difficulty\nand further work needs to be done to establish the detailed\nrelationship between the spectral width and the PCB.\nAcknowledgements.
