Introduction \n \nPrevious research has demonstrated that individuals can be quite strategic in \ntheir presentations of self in cyberspace (e.g., Walther, Slovacek, and Tidwell, 2001). \nOthers have contended that the success of moving an online relationship offline may \nbe dependent on the type of self that is presented in the cyber-world (e.g., Bargh, \nMcKenna, and Fitzsimons, 2002; McKenna, Green, and Gleason, 2002). This study \nwas interested in how men and women presented themselves on an online dating site. \nIt does so by considering theories on \u2018possible selves\u2019 and Goffman\u2019s \u2018performed self\u2019 \ntheory. \n \n1.1 Presentation of self online: possible selves \nIt has for some time been recognized that online relationships do initiate \nonline and can move successfully offline (Whitty and Carr, 2006; Whitty 2007). In \nmore recent times researchers have been interested in how these relationships \nprogress. Some, for example, have been interested in how individuals go about \npresenting themselves in cyberspace and what presentations of self lead to more \nsuccessful relationship development.  \nTheorists have argued that individuals can be quite selective in their self-\npresentations online (e.g., Bargh et al., 2002; McKenna et al., 2002; Walther et al., \n2001). For example, Walther and his colleagues (2001) believe that while of course \nindividuals do tend to be strategic in their presentation of self offline, in CMC \nimpression management is more controllable and fluid. They claim that \u201conline \ncommunicators may exploit the capabilities of text-based, nonvisual interaction to \nform levels of affinity that would be unexpected in parallel offline interactions\u201d \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 3 \n(Walther et al., 2001, p. 110). As a consequence in some situations CMC users \nidealize their virtual partners. John Bargh and his colleagues (Bargh et al., 2002; \nMcKenna, et al., 2002) have also focused on presentation of self online. In particular, \nthey have focused on which presentation of self on the internet is more likely to lead \nto closer relationships. These researchers have drawn from Rogers\u2019 and Higgins\u2019 \nwork on personality to come up with two aspects of self that they believe are \nimportant to consider when focusing on the development of relationships online -- \n\u2018true\u2019 selves and \u2018actual\u2019 selves.  \n As stated above, Bargh et al. (2002) and McKenna et al. (2002) have drawn \nfrom Rogers\u2019 and Higgins\u2019 work on personality to arrive at two aspects of the self that \nthey believe are important to consider when focusing on the development of \nrelationships online, these being the 'true self' and 'actual self'. These theorists drew \nfrom Carl Rogers\u2019 (1951) work to define the true self (or what they also refer to as the \n\u2018Real Me\u2019) as traits or characteristics that individuals posses and would like to but are \nnot usually able to express. Rogers (1951) developed a humanistic personality theory \nwhere the 'self' is a central construct. Rogers' believed that the self developed through \ninteractions with others, and that the point of therapy was to help people to discover \ntheir true selves. He understood the \u2018true self\u2019 to represent one\u2019s inner core \u2013 who \nthey really are. Theoretically, an individual can do this if they experience \n'unconditional positive regard'. In contrast, drawing from Higgins\u2019 (1987) research, \nthese theorists defined the actual self as traits or characteristics that individuals \npossess and express to others in social settings. Higgins (1987) made a clear \ndistinction between three aspects of the self: the 'actual self', 'ideal self', and 'ought to \nself'. The 'actual self' is the representation of how you or another actually believes you \nare; the 'ideal self' is the representation of how you or another would like to see \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 4 \nyourself, including hopes and wishes for you; and the 'ought to self' represents the \nattributes that you believe you should possess. In line with Higgins, these researchers \nclaim that as one develops trust and intimacy with one\u2019s partner they are more likely \nto disclose aspects of themselves that are not widely known to others. They have \nargued that individuals who are more likely to express their true self online will \nconsider the relationships they form in this space to be more identity-important \ncompared to those individuals who are more likely to express their true selves in non-\ninternet relationships.  \nTo test the above ideas, Bargh, McKenna and their colleagues conducted a \nnumber of experiments. Bargh et al. (2002) measured true and actual selves by asking \nparticipants to list a maximum of ten traits or characteristics that participants believed \nthey actually possessed and expressed to others in social settings, as well as what \ncharacteristics individuals possessed and would like to but are typically unable to \nexpress to others. Their series of experiments revealed that the individuals\u2019 true selves \nwere more accessible in memory after interacting with a stranger online compared to \nface-to-face. Moreover, they found that participants tended to like each other more \nwhen they meet first online compared to face-to-face. \nTaking this work a step further, McKenna et al. (2002) were interested in \nwhether individuals who are better able to disclose their \u2018true\u2019 selves online than \noffline were more equipped to form close relationships online and then take these \nrelationships offline successfully. They randomly selected 20 Usenet newsgroups to \ninclude in their study. Over a 3-week period, questionnaires were emailed to every \nfifth poster in each of the newsgroups (excluding spam). Their first study found that \nwhen people convey their \u2018true\u2019 self online they develop strong internet relationships \nand bring these relationships into their \u2018real\u2019 lives. Two years after this initial study \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 5 \n354 of the 568 participants were emailed a follow-up survey (the remainder of the \nsample had email addresses that were no longer valid). In line with these researchers\u2019 \nprediction, these relationships remained relatively stable and durable over the 2-year \nperiod; however, one has to wonder how the 38% of the sample that were not \nfollowed up faired. In this same research, McKenna et al. (2002) found that \nparticipants who were more socially anxious and lonely were somewhat more likely \nto believe they could express their true selves with others online than they could with \npeople they knew offline. McKenna et al. (2002) conclude from this research that: \n \nrather than turning to the Internet as a way of hiding from real life and from \nforming real relationships, individuals use it as a means not only of \nmaintaining ties with existing family and friends but also of forming close and \nmeaningful new relationships in a relatively nonthreatening environment. The \nInternet may also be helpful for those who have difficulty forging relationships \nin face-to-face situations because of shyness, social anxiety, or a lack of social \nskills. (p. 30) \n \n1.2 Presentation of self online: Goffman \n \nGoffman was very interested in the ways people present themselves in their \neveryday face-to-face encounters. In his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday \nLife, Goffman (1959) argued for a dualistic image of the self. He described the self as \nboth a performer and a character. According to Goffman (1959) the \u2018self-as-\nperformer\u2019 is not merely a social product, but also has a basic motivational core. In \ncontrast, the \u2018self-as-character\u2019 represents an individuals\u2019 unique humanity. It is this \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 6 \npart of the self which is a social product; that is, performed outwardly in social life. \nThe \u2018self-as-character\u2019 is one\u2019s inner self. \nGoffman believed that individuals need to present themselves as an acceptable \nperson to others. He stated that \u201cthe impressions that the others give tend to be treated \nas claims and promises they have implicitly made, and claims and promises tend to \nhave a moral character\u201d (Goffman, 1959\/1997, p.21). He argued that individuals can \nbe strategic in their impression formation. In particular Goffman was interested in \ndistinguishing between expressions \u2018given\u2019 (e.g., spoken communication) and \nexpressions \u2018given off\u2019 (e.g., nonverbal cues) in a face-to-face interaction. \nResearchers have applied Goffman\u2019s theory to online presentations of self. \nMiller (1995) claims that although depth and richness of self presentation might not \nseem immediately apparent online that nonetheless \u201cthe problem of establishing and \nmaintaining an acceptable self remains, and there is a range of expressive resources \navailable for this end\u201d. Miller and Arnold (2001) applied Goffman\u2019s theory to explain \nhow woman academics construct their own webpages. Drawing from his theory they \nsuggest that women academics struggled with establishing a credible presence on the \nwebsites. \n \n1.3 Offline presentations and relationship development \n \n Of course long before the internet ever existed psychologists were interested in \nhow romantic relationships initiated offline and what types of presentation of self \ntypically leads to budding relationships. One of the most popular theories to explain \nrelationship development is \u2018Social Penetration Theory\u2019 (Altman and Taylor, 1973). \nSocial Penetration Theory is an incremental theory which argues that relationships \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 7 \nmove to greater levels of intimacy over time. According to this theory, how greater \nintimacy is achieved is typically through depth and breadth of self-disclosure. Breadth \nof self-disclosure refers to discussing a range of topics, such as information about \none\u2019s family, career, and so forth. Depth refers to the more central core of one\u2019s \npersonality; that is, the more unique aspects of one\u2019s self. The timing of how much \none self-discloses is crucial to determining whether a relationship will continue to \nproceed. Rushing self-disclosure in the early stages of a relationship can seem \nunnatural and desperate and can quite lead to an abrupt end.  \n \n1.4 Study purpose \n \nThis present study was interested in how individuals present themselves in \ncyberspace. Given that cyberspace is not one generic space (Whitty and Carr, 2006) it \nis important to investigate how individuals present themselves in different spaces \nonline. In particular, this study was interested in how individuals present themselves \non an online dating site, as well as their judgments on how others present themselves \non this site. Online dating sites have increased in popularity and will no doubt \ncontinue to do so (Brym and Lenton, 2001; Whitty and Carr, 2006; Whitty, 2007). \nHowever, there is a dearth of research available on how individuals use this space to \ninitiate and develop relationships. \nOnline dating sites are set up very differently to other places online, such as \nnewsgroups, chat rooms, and the like. On online dating sites individuals are required \nto construct a profile. On this profile they can upload photographs and videos of \nthemselves and are given the opportunity to write a description of who they are. The \nway individuals contact each other on the site varies depending on the way the site is \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 8 \nset up. The online dating site which this study focused on is one of the largest \nAustralian online dating sites. Individuals contact each other on this dating site by \nfirstly sending someone a \u2018kiss\u2019. The \u2018kiss\u2019 is a sentence sent through the site to an \nundisclosed email indicating that the individual is interested in the person they \ncontacted. The contacted person can then respond to three options, including a) they \nare interested and are requesting that the other person spend money on sending an \nemail through the site, or b) they are interested and they themselves will spend money \non emailing the person through the site, or c) they were flattered but uninterested. \nNext, individuals pay for \u2018stamps\u2019 which would enable them to send emails through \nthe site. This is how the company makes their money. Individuals can write anything \nin these emails. It is within this email that individuals can disclose their personal \nemail so that contact can be made off the dating site. \nThis present study examined the types of selves individuals are more likely to \npresent on an online dating site, and how they view other people\u2019s presentation of \nself. Additionally, it considered what types of presentations of self will lead to the \ndevelopment of a successful romantic relationships offline. Moreover, because \nprevious research on offline attraction has found that men and women are attracted to \ndifferent qualities in the opposite sex, gender differences were also taken into account. \n \n2. Method \n \n2.1 Participants \n \nSixty online daters were interviewed for this study (30 men and 30 women). \nThe ages ranged from 23 - 60 years, with an overall mean age of 43.40 years (SD = \n8.70). This is very close to the average mean age for the total number of individuals \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 9 \nwho use the site (M = 45 years). The mean age for men was 42.63 years (SD = 10.57) \nand for women was 44.97 (SD = 6.27) years. All participants resided in Australia. \nForty-three percent of the sample stated that their relationship status was single, 46% \nwere divorced or separated, 8% had a girlfriend or a boyfriend, and 3% were married \nor in a cohabiting relationship. All of the participants self-reported as being \nheterosexual. Individuals reported that they had been using the online dating site for \nan average of 27.42 months (SD = 16.36). Interestingly, about a third (27%) of \nindividuals stated that they were using online dating as the only method of finding a \npotential date.  \nIn considering the highest level of education achieved by this sample, 34% had \ncompleted high school, 28% had a diploma, 28% had a degree and 10% had achieved \npostgraduate qualifications. The Australian 2001 census data revealed that 3% of \nAustralians held postgraduate qualifications, 8% had a degree, and 22% had received \na diploma (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2001). Hence, this sample was slightly \nskewed towards a better educated group of individuals. \n \n2.2 Procedure \n \nParticipants were recruited from the largest Australian online dating site. For \nethical reasons (to keep the online daters\u2019 identity confidential) the manager of the \nonline dating company carried out the recruitment of participants. She randomly \nselected 300 participants from the database inviting them to participate in a telephone \ninterview about their online dating experiences. There was a response rate of 20%, \nwhich is reasonable given the personal nature of the study; the possibility that many \nof the participants might have discontinued using the site and hence had no interest in \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 10 \nparticipating in the study; and some of the emails might have no longer been operable. \nThe individuals were emailed from the manager the details of the study, including the \naims of the study, what was involved, and contact details of the principal investigator \nand the ethics board at the University of Western Sydney (where the research was \nconducted). They were told that if they were interested in being interviewed that they \nwere to either phone or email the principal investigator to organize a time for a \ntelephone interview. \n A structured interview schedule, which mostly consisted of open-ended \nquestions, was designed for this study. Participants were initially asked to report basic \ndemographic details about themselves (e.g., age, relationships status, and socio-\neconomic status). Next they were asked to explain their motivations for using the site. \nParticipants were then asked to explain in detail how they went about using the site, \nincluding questions on how they constructed their own profiles, what sort of profiles \nthey were attracted to, and how they went about contacting other individuals on the \nsite. They were then asked to explain how the relationship progressed from online to \noffline, including questions on the pace of the relationship, how well others matched \nup to their profiles, as well as what kind of personal information they disclosed to \ntheir online potential date. They were asked to describe how their face-to-face dates \nwere typically set up and why they were set up in this way. They were finally asked to \ncompare online dating with other forms of dating.  \n The interviews were all conducted on the telephone. Male participants were \ninterviewed by a male research assistant and female participants were interviewed by \nthe author of this paper. They typically went for 40 - 50 minutes. All participants \ngranted their permission to have the conversations audio taped. Participants were \nassured anonymity and were told that pseudonyms would be used to replace their real \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 11 \nnames. Participants were reminded that they could withdraw from the study at any \ntime up until the completion of the study and were given a number for a free \ntelephone counseling service in case the study raised any issues for them that they \nwanted to speak to a counselor about.  \n \n2.3 Analysis \n \nGrounded theory methodology (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) guided the \nprocedures for this research. As Willig (2001) points out \u201cgrounded theory involves \nthe progressive identification and integration of categories of meaning from data. \nGrounded theory is both the process of category identification and integration (as \nmethod) and its product (as theory)\u201d (p.33). In this study themes emerged from the \nparticipants\u2019 responses rather than a priori categories. Although strictly speaking \ngrounded theory puts aside any previous theories in order to develop new theories \n(Glaser and Strauss, 1967), this analysis did take into account previous work on \npresentation of self online and offline when considering the data. Previous researchers \nhave also conducted qualitative research in this way (Willig, 2001). Once themes \nwere decided upon each transcript was re-examined and coded for whether that theme \nwas absent or present. To ensure inter-coder reliability two scorers separately coded \nthe entire data set. In the very few cases where there was disagreement the researchers \ndiscussed their disagreements until consensus was reached. Moreover, given that this \nstudy was also interested in gender differences, logistic regressions were carried out \nusing the Backward Wald procedure, which produces a Chi-square statistic. Because \nlogistic regression cannot always obtain accurate calculations with zero cells, Fisher\u2019s \nexact test was carried out when there was a zero cell. \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 12 \n \n3. Results and discussion \n \nThe following analysis details how the participants presented themselves on \nthis internet dating site, what aspects they misrepresented, as well as what features \nthey found attractive in others. Next, participants\u2019 views on how others presented \nthemselves on this dating site is discussed as well as how well these profiles matched \nwith the person when they met them face-to-face. Extracts from the interviews are \npresented here as illustration of the themes. Pseudonyms are used in place of the \nparticipants\u2019 real names.  \n \n3.1 Constructing their own profile \n \nThe online daters interviewed for this study stressed the importance of crafting \nan attractive profile. Table 1 presents a list of aspects that individuals considered in \nconstructing their own profiles. Participants typically elected to have a photo (many \nselecting the most flattering photo they could find), some even going as far as having \na glamour shot. Descriptions of favorite interests and activities, one\u2019s personality, \noccupation, and hopes and dreams were also deemed important by some of the \nparticipants. Others tried to make their profile stand out by adding humor or finding a \nway to make themselves appear unique. More women than men stated that they \nincluded a photo (and more women than men said that this was a glamour photo). \nMoreover, more women than men said that they wrote about their interests. \n \nTable 1  Aspects individuals included in their own profiles \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 13 \nConstructing own profile \n \n \nMen \nf \n(%) \nWomen \nf \n(%) \nTotal \nf \n(%) \n\u03c72 \u03b2 Exp \u03b2 \nPhoto \n \n18 \n(60.0%) \n26 \n(86.7%) \n44 \n(73.3%) \n5.03* \nwomen > men \n1.47 4.33 \nInterests\/activities they \nenjoy doing \n11 \n(36.7%) \n21 \n(70.0%) \n32 \n(53.3%) \n6.43* \nwomen > men \n1.39 4.03 \nDescription of personality \n \n10 \n(33.3%) \n11 \n(36.7%) \n21 \n(35.0%) \nns   \nMade it humorous \n \n7 \n(23.3%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n10 \n(16.7%) \nns   \nOccupation \n \n4 \n(13.3%) \n4 \n(13.3%) \n8 \n(13.3%) \nns   \nDemonstrate their \nintelligence \n4 \n(13.3%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n7 \n(11.7%) \nns   \nWrote it to sound \ndifferent\/unique \n4 \n(13.3%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n7 \n(11.7%) \nns   \nPlayed down own beauty \n \n1 \n(3.3%) \n5 \n(16.7%) \n6 \n(10.0%) \nns   \nGlamour shot \n \n0 \n(0.0%) \n5 \n(16.7%) \n5 \n(8.3%) \n5.46* \nwomen > men \n  \nHopes and dreams \n \n1 \n(3.3%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n4 \n(6.7%) \nns   \n* p < .05,   ** p < .01, *** p < .001 \nNote: Fisher\u2019s exact test was carried out for glamour shot \n \n It is noteworthy that participants did discuss in detail the importance of having \na photograph on their profile. This is nicely illustrated by Joan: \n \nI Did you put a photograph up of yourself? \nJ Yes. \nI And how did you decide what type of photograph to put up of \nyourself? \nJ Well obviously you want something decent and I didn\u2019t have a lot of \nthings around. So the photograph that I have got was a studio glamour \nphotograph where they did your makeup and your hair and made you \nlook gorgeous, but that is the only decent photograph I had. \n(Joan) \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 14 \n \n A number of previous theorists have downplayed the importance of the body \nonline and the need to appear physically attractive. For example, Levine (2000) wrote \nthat \u201cthe beauty of the virtual medium is that flirting is based on words, charm, and \nseduction, not physical attraction and cues\u201d (p.565). Similarly, Rollman, Krug, and \nParente (2000) comment that \u201cby eliminating time, distance, and body, the architects \nof the Internet have created an unhindered medium that connects the mind and spirit\u201d \n(p. 161). However, in stark contrast, this study revealed that participants believed that \nthe need to present a good physical image of themselves was more important than any \nother characteristic. \n The results from this study highlight some of the similarities between online \nand offline attraction. Offline, physical characteristics play a critical role in attractions \nfor both men and women. Moreover, research on face-to-face attraction has found that \nmen are typically more readily aroused sexually than women by visual stimuli (e.g., \nEllis and Symons, 1990; Townsend, 1993). Hence, it is no surprise, that more women \nthan men included photos in their profiles, and more women than men choose to have \n\u2018glamour\u2019 photos of themselves. Townsend and Wasserman (1997) also contend that \nwomen are more interested in men that demonstrate a willingness to invest in them. \nThis perhaps explains why the women put more effort into detailing their interests \u2013 \nto be certain that they are attracting someone truly interested in them.  \nParticipants talked about the importance of writing a profile that successfully \nattracted others. Some described this as a process of \u2018selling themselves\u2019. This is \nexplained by Wayne below: \n \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 15 \nW The other thing for me personally is I\u2019m great at writing trade manuals \nfor someone, but when it comes to writing about yourself and trying to \nsell yourself it\u2019s a very different story. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s \nmore of a male trait than a female trait. It depends how good you want \nto try selling yourself too isn\u2019t it?  \n(Wayne) \n \nIndividuals did admit to misrepresenting themselves on their profiles. This \nthey stated was not for malicious reasons, but rather as a way to attract others. Mostly \nthey saw their misrepresentations as exaggerations rather than blatant lies. About half \nthe sample (51%) admitted to misrepresenting themselves on the site. As \ndemonstrated in Table 2, individuals admitted to lying about their looks, their current \nrelationships, age, weight, socio-economic status, and interests. Interestingly, the \nwomen lied about looks or used outdated photos more than men did. Again this can be \nexplained by men placing more emphasis on being attracted to a partner who is \nphysical attractive. With this being the case women have more reason to misrepresent \ntheir looks. \n \nTable 2 Participants misrepresentations on their own profiles \nMisrepresentations on \nown profiles \n \nMen \nf \n(%) \nWomen \nf \n(%) \nTotal \nf \n(%) \n\u03c72 \u03b2 Exp \u03b2 \nLooks: photo over a year \nout of date \n2 \n(6.7%) \n14 \n(46.7%) \n16 \n(26.7%) \n \n9.38** \nwomen > men \n2.51 12.25 \nDetails about their own \nrelationship\/children \n(e.g., having them, who \nthey live with etc) \n4 \n(13.3%) \n2 \n(6.7%) \n6 \n(10.0%) \n \nns   \nAge \n3 \n(10.0%) \n1 \n(3.3%) \n4 \n(6.7%) \nns   \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 16 \n \nWeight (e.g., said average \nwhen a bit overweight) \n2 \n(6.7%) \n2 \n(6.7%) \n4 \n(6.7%) \n \nns   \nSES (occupation, being \nemployed, professional, \nincome) \n2 \n(6.7%) \n1 \n(3.3%) \n3 \n(5.0%) \n \nns   \nInterests \n3 \n(10.0%) \n0 \n(0.0%) \n3 \n(5.0%) \nns   \n* p < .05,   ** p < .01, *** p < .001 \n \nAs stated above, most participants rationalized that their misrepresentations \nwere not out-and-out lies, but rather mere exaggerations, and often exaggerations that \nthey thought others were probably also doing in their profiles. To give some \nexamples: \n \nS Actually, it\u2019s quite funny that there is, you can pick, there is a thing for \nbody type and you can pick \u2018slim, average, athletic, a bit overweight\u2019.  \nDo you know any chick that is going to tell you that they are a bit \noverweight? \nI I wouldn\u2019t know, I guess not? \nS That is right, so I just say average. \nI It\u2019s like the idea of perception of what is \u2018average\u2019, and average is you \nknow probably a bit overweight anyway. \n(Suszi)  \n \nM Well it\u2019s all perception of reality isn\u2019t it. Everyone\u2019s view of the world \nis different, my view of myself may be very different to what someone \nelse thinks it is. But you know, my view is that you had to sell yourself \nwithout being. I mean the last thing you want is reality shock, when \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 17 \npeople get there and go \u2018that is not what he said he was about\u2019, so you \nhave got to make the most of what you have got without exaggerating \nit so much that they never see you again. So, I would say it was \nprobably 90% accurate with a few little embellishments you know. \nI Tell us about the embellishments. \nM Oh gosh \u2026 you know things like portraying things in the most positive \nlight. You know things like interests. I don\u2019t think I really have definite \nmusic interests or anything, but I just said, \u2018I am on a first name basis \nwith people at HMV\u2019 but I am not really but it doesn\u2019t matter. You \nknow that sort of thing. \n(Matthew) \n \n The interviewees explained that constructing a profile was a dynamic process. \nAs demonstrated in some of the quotations above, people experimented with what \nphotos and descriptions of themselves would be more successful at attracting others to \ntheir profile. They also re-wrote profiles to attract the partner they were searching for. \nHowever, there was a third concern that participants considered in constructing their \nprofiles. Participants were also aware that relationships were not developed online but \nrather offline. Over half of the participants (57.4%) stated that they met their date \nwithin a week or two after initial contact on the site. Another 10.3% stated that they \nmet their date within a month. Hence, it is fair to say that individuals use online dating \nsites as a means to identify a potential date and that cyberspace is not, in the main, \nutilized as a medium to get to know the person. In fact, participants were adamant \nabout the importance of the first meeting, with 67.6% of the participants stating that \nthe first meeting determined if the relationship would progress. They also stated that \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 18 \nany emailing or telephone calls that were made prior to the first date were more to \norganize the date and verify information about a person, rather than disclosing any \nfurther information about themselves. As expressed by Andrew: \n \nA We exchanged at least two emails each after the first contact email I \nguess and then probably phoned up to organise a time to meet and get \ntogether.  Not so much as getting on the phone and speaking for 3 \nhours or anything like that \u2026 \n (Andrew) \n \nGiven this, individuals were concerned that their profiles reflect how they \u2018actually\u2019 \nare in everyday situations. In order to ensure this, individuals asked their friends and \nfamily to check if their profiles were a true reflection of themselves, as Crystal \nexplains: \n \nI What about your own profile?   \nC I tried to vary it I suppose \u2026  As far as myself goes, I tried to just put \nwho I am but I must admit it is really hard because other people may \nsee you in a different way, so I actually think it\u2019s a good idea to have \nsomebody else look at your profile, like a friend because as I said you \nmay see yourself differently than everyone else does. \n(Crystal) \n \nThe findings reported here differ somewhat to the results yielded in the work \ncarried out by Bargh, McKenna, and colleagues (e.g., Bargh et al., 2002; McKenna et \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 19 \nal., 2002). As summarized earlier in this paper, these researchers believe that \nindividuals who are able to express their \u2018true\u2019 self online (traits or characteristics that \nindividuals posses and would like to but are not usually able to express in their \neveryday lives) are more likely to develop strong internet relationships and bring \nthese relationships into their \u2018real\u2019 lives. However, the participants in this current \nstudy instead appeared to be trying to create a balance between keeping their profiles \nreal (actual self) as well as selling themselves (or describing how they would like to \nbe). The motivation for this was based on not wanting to disappoint the date once they \nmet them face-to-face, but at the same time trying to attract a decent number of \nindividuals to choose from. Therefore, cyberspace is partly perceived by these \nparticipants as a safe space to identify their \u2018true\u2019 self or  play around with \npresentations of themselves (Whitty, 2003) but at the same time how much people do \nthis is restricted if they want to ensure their date is not disappointed when they meet \nface-to-face.  \n \n3.2 Considering other online daters\u2019 profiles \n \n Individuals might have felt the need to present a profile that presented a mix of \ntheir actual and true self; however, is that what they, in turn, expected of their \npotential dates? The interviewees were very clear about what they hoped for in a \npartner. In fact, when asked they presented a \u2018shopping list\u2019 of characteristics they \nwere seeking out. Table 3 presents a list of the attractive qualities people were looking \nfor in a partner.  \n \nTable 3 Aspects participants were looking for in a partner \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 20 \nAttractive qualities \n \n \nMen \nf \n(%) \nWomen \nf \n(%) \nTotal \nf \n(%) \n\u03c72 \nLooks \n \n29 \n(96.7%) \n25 \n(83.3%) \n54 \n(90.0%) \nns \nSimilar interests\/values \n \n25 \n(83.3%) \n26 \n(86.7%) \n51 \n(85.0%) \nns \nSES \n \n22 \n(73.3%) \n22 \n(73.3%) \n44 \n(73.3%) \nns \nPersonality \n \n19 \n(63.3%) \n24 \n(80.0%) \n43 \n(71.1%) \nns \nHonest\/genuine\/real people \n \n17 \n(56.7%) \n15 \n(50.0%) \n32 \n(53.3%) \nns \nAttracted to a certain age group \n \n11 \n(36.7%) \n17 \n(56.7%) \n28 \n(46.7%) \nns \nHeight \n \n9 \n(30.0%) \n16 \n(53.3%) \n25 \n(41.7%) \nns \nProximity \n \n11 \n(36.7%) \n13 \n(43.3%) \n24 \n(40.0%) \nns \nSize\/weight \n \n14 \n(46.7%) \n8 \n(26.7%) \n22 \n(36.7%) \nns \nNon-smokers \n \n11 \n(36.7%) \n6 \n(20.0%) \n17 \n(28.3%) \nns \nDifferent\/unique people\/ people \nwith different interests to their own \n7 \n(23.3%) \n10 \n(33.3%) \n17 \n(28.3%) \nns \nHumour \n \n6 \n(20.0%) \n8 \n(26.7%) \n14 \n(23.3%) \nns \nSomeone with no children\/off their \nhands \n \n5 \n(16.7%) \n7 \n(23.3%) \n12 \n(20.0%) \nns \nSomeone who has children \n \n5 \n(16.7%) \n5 \n(16.7%) \n10 \n(16.7%) \nns \nOpening line \n \n5 \n(16.7%) \n2 \n(6.7%) \n7 \n(11.7%) \nns \nStar sign \n \n1 \n(3.3%) \n5 \n(16.7%) \n6 \n(10.0%) \nns \nSomeone who wants children \n \n1 \n(3.3%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n4 \n(6.7%) \nns \n* p < .05,   ** p < .01, *** p < .001 \n \nContrary to some theorists\u2019 views (e.g., Levine, 2000; Rollman et al., 2000) \nthese online daters did not de-emphasize physical attractiveness as an important \nquality. Noticeably, looks actually topped the list. The importance placed on physical \ncharacteristics may be greater for online daters than for individuals developing \nrelationships in other places online. This is for two reasons: a) when individuals first \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 21 \n\u2018meet\u2019 the person online, they are presented with a photo and not simply text, b) there \nare a plethora of choices (and unlike places where 100s of people are interacting \nonline, such as MOOs, online daters \u2018know\u2019 that everyone on the site is seeking \nromance) and so they can bypass the less attractive profiles and make a play for the \nmore attractive ones. \nInteresting, the traditional gender differences for what men and women are \nattracted to did not emerge in this study. Unlike previous studies on offline attraction \n(see for example, Ellis and Symons, 1990; Townsend, 1993), men did not state \nsignificantly more than women that they were looking for an attractive looking \nperson. Moreover, women did not state more than men that they were looking for \nsomeone with high socio-economic status. This is contrary to what researchers have \nfound in regards to offline relationships (see for example, Buss and Barnes, 1986; \nKendrick, Sadalla, Groth, and Trost, 1990; Townsend and Wasserman, 1997) where \nwomen are typically more interested than men in seeking out a partner with high SES. \nPhysical attractiveness (mentioned by 90%) and socio-economic status (mentioned by \n73.3%) were highly sought out qualities by both men and women in this study. \nTherefore, what might be happening on these dating sites is that given the numerous \nperceived choices available to individuals (with 1000s of profiles to sought through), \nthese online daters are consequently adding more to their \u2018wish list\u2019 for a potential \npartner. This is a very different playing field when compared to traditional methods of \nmeeting people in pubs and clubs where one perceives far fewer potential dates. \n Despite admissions of their own exaggerations in their profiles, the \nparticipants in this study were often outraged to find when they meet face-to-face that \ntheir date had misrepresented themselves in their profiles. Table 4 displays some of \nthe characteristics that the participants\u2019 dates misrepresented about themselves. \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 22 \nInterestingly, male online daters were said to misrepresent their height and their \nrelationships status more than women. \n \nTable 4  How other online daters misrepresented themselves on the online \ndating site \n \nOther online dater\u2019s \nmisrepresentations  \n \nMen \nf \n(%) \nWomen \nf \n(%) \nTotal \nf \n(%) \n\u03c72 \nLooks (including describing \nthemselves as better looking that \nwhat they really are; out-dated \nphotos; a photo of a different \nperson) \n24 \n(80.0%) \n17 \n(56.7%) \n41 \n(68.3%) \nns \nWeight\/Size \n \n9 \n(30.0%) \n16 \n(53.3%) \n25 \n(41.7%) \nns \nPersonality \n \n10 \n(33.3%) \n9 \n(30.0%) \n19 \n(31.7%) \nns \nAge \n \n9 \n(30.0%) \n6 \n(20.0%) \n15 \n(25.0%) \nns \nHeight \n \n10 \n(33.3%) \n0 \n(0.0%) \n10 \n(16.7%) \n12.00** \nmen > women \nTheir intentions (e.g., just for sex \nnot relationship) \n \n5 \n(16.7%) \n5 \n(16.7%) \n10 \n(16.7%) \nns \nSES (education, occupation, income, \nbeing professional) \n6 \n(20.0%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n9 \n(15%) \nns \nRelationship status (did not admit on \nprofile that they are married) \n8 \n(26.7%) \n0 \n(0.0%) \n8 \n(13.3%) \n9.23** \nmen > women \nHaving children \n \n2 \n(6.7%) \n3 \n(10.0%) \n5 \n(8.3%) \nns \nBeing a smoker \n \n1 \n(3.3%) \n2 \n(6.7%) \n3 \n(5.0%) \nns \n* p < .05,   ** p < .01, *** p < .001 \nNote Fisher\u2019s exact test were carried out for height and relationship status \n \nThe most common way that individuals misrepresented themselves was in \nregards to their physical appearance. Again, this is perhaps not surprising given this \nwas the most highly valued characteristic. Some exemplars of the ways the \nparticipants\u2019 online dates misrepresented themselves are presented below: \n \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 23 \nI In what way do they lie about their profession? \nL Most guys make you understand on their thing [profile] that they are in \nmanagement, but when you talk to them they are not really in \nmanagement, they are not even middle management some of them. \nI So they kind of exaggerate their role considerably?  \nL Yes definitely. \n(Lisa) \n \nC A lot of people say they are looking for a long-term relationship or a \nfriendship and what I think they are after is a one night stand. \n(Christine) \n \nAs demonstrated in the extracts above, some of the misrepresentations were \nblatant lies; however, it could also be argued that some of the misrepresentations were \nindividuals\u2019 representations of their \u2018true\u2019 selves. As illustrated by Kim: \n \nK I think also some people have got a very different grasp of who they \nare compared to what the rest of the world sees, so I don\u2019t think it is so \nmuch that people blatantly lie, I haven\u2019t experienced that. One guy \nwho I found, he was relying on how he has got a very funny \npersonality, or a good disposition sort of thing. He turned out to be one \nof the most depressing people I have ever met in my life.  \n(Kim) \n \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 24 \nIn addition to sorting through the lies presented on profiles, interviewees were \noften weary of profiles that contained \u2018cheesy\u2019 clich\u00e9s. They mostly avoided these \ntypes of individuals, as they believed these people to be far less \u2018real\u2019. To some, \nclich\u00e9s became a \u2018turn off\u2019, rather than the \u2018turn on\u2019 that the person writing the profile \nhad hoped for. To give an example of a clich\u00e9d profile: \n \nG  \u2026 and everyone says that they like walking on the beach, and anyone \nwill tell you that it is so god damn boring (laugh). And when they say \nthat I think \u2018oh my God, not another one, it is almost a turn off\u2019. \nI They are all on that beach walking (laughing). \nG Oh my God, if there are so many on that beach walking, why don\u2019t \nthey run into each other. \nI So a bit clich\u00e9 that one? \nG Terrible, it is almost a turn off now.   \n(Grace) \n \nWhen we examine which characteristics individuals are attracted to in this \nparticular online space, again Bargh, McKenna, and colleagues\u2019 (e.g., Bargh et al., \n2002; McKenna et al., 2002) theory does not hold true. Rather interviewees stated that \nthey were attracted to genuine and honest people and they hoped that an individual\u2019s \nprofile presents something about who the individual \u2018really\u2019 is -- rather than a \nstereotypical, clich\u00e9d self or a self that the individual would like to possess but \ntypically do not express in their day-to-day settings. In fact, over half of the \nparticipants said that an attractive person was one who was genuine and real (see \nTable 3). It appears that these individuals were more attracted to individuals who \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 25 \nexpressed their \u2018actual\u2019 self. That is, online daters perceived honest and genuine \npeople to be those who included in their profiles the traits or characteristics that they \ntypically express in everyday offline social settings. \nThese online daters were most concerned with what their date looked like and \nhow they behaved in their first face-to-face meeting. In fact, 67.6% claimed that the \nfirst face-to-face meeting was a screening out process \u2013 one that determined if there \nwas a possibility for a relationship to develop. This is nicely expressed by Phil: \n \nP Well I got sick of meeting girls and everything\u2019s based on this, even \nthough it\u2019s not supposed to be looks, everything\u2019s based on the first \nmeeting, that\u2019s the big shock compared to meeting someone in a pub or \nsomeone introducing you.   \n (Phil) \n \nGiven the importance placed on that first meeting and making the best first \nface-to-face impression, if the individual did not match up to the profile, as described \nearlier, the online dater was highly disappointed with their date \u2013 often judging them \nas dishonest people. These online daters learnt fairly quickly that people might present \na different self online than they do offline. Therefore, unlike McKenna et al.\u2019s (2002) \nsample, individuals who used the online dating site did not want to spend time getting \nto know one another in cyberspace. In fact, they were quite the opposite, expressing a \ndesire to meet the person face-to-face as soon as possible. Hence, there was little \nopportunity or desire for people to get to know individuals \u2018true\u2019 selves or for \nindividuals to gradually express their true selves.  \n \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 26 \n3.3 Developing a theory for the presentation of self on internet dating sites \n \n This study revealed both similarities and differences between dating initiated \non an internet dating site when compared to other forms of dating both online and \noffline. Similar to dating face-to-face, individuals stressed the importance of physical \nlooks as an attractive quality they were looking for in a partner. Also, as other \nprevious researchers have contended (e.g., Turkle, 1995; Whitty, 2003), these \nparticipants found that cyberspace was a place where they could be somewhat creative \nwith their identity and presentation of self. However, there were limits to how \nimaginative individuals could be in their presentations of self. \n In line with Walther\u2019s theories (e.g., Walther, 1995), these online daters were \nvery strategic in their presentation of self. However, the ways these individuals \npresented themselves in cyberspace differs to what previous researchers have found. \nAlthough online daters were tempted to present a \u2018true\u2019 self or a more attractive self \nthan what they typically are in face-to-face encounters, they were nonetheless mindful \nof the importance of presenting an \u2018actual\u2019 self. Although further research is required \nto test this claim, it seemed apparent that, contrary to McKenna et al.\u2019s (2002) study, \nthose who presented their \u2018actual\u2019 selves in this study were more likely to successfully \nprogress a relationship offline. \n As mentioned in the introduction of this paper, some theorists have applied \nGoffman\u2019s theory to explain presentation of self in cyberspace. His theory might also \nbe of use to explain individuals\u2019 expectations of how others ought to present \nthemselves on an online dating site. On an online dating site there is very little \nopportunity to witness expressions \u2018given off\u2019. Possible ways to \u2018read between the \nlines\u2019 or look for the expressions \u2018given off\u2019 is evident when participants skeptically \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 27 \nviewed clich\u00e9d profiles. Moreover, online daters checked to see if their date matched \nup to their profile when they meet face-to-face. In Goffman\u2019s terms they are able to \nsee how well the \u2018real character\u2019 matches up to the performance. When there is a \ndiscrepancy, as Goffman would predict, the online daters in this study judge their \ndates are immoral, believing they had an obligation to match the impressions created \nin their profile. \n Gender differences that are evident in offline attraction were only partly \nevident in this study. Women were more likely than men to present a photo of \nthemselves and made greater attempts at ensuring an attractive image of themselves \nwas presented. However, when it came to what attractive qualities men and women \npreferred there were no significant differences. However, rather than de-emphasizing \nqualities, online daters appeared to hope for more from their potential date. Arguably, \nthis is because online daters have a greater number of potential mates to select from \nthan in typical face-to-face situations. Given this perception of choice, online daters \nmight be raising their hopes and expectations as to what potential mate they might \nattract. However, while on the surface this might seem a strength of online dating, \nfuture research needs to investigate if one does indeed attract a better quality mate, or \nif this raise in expectations leads to greater disappointment.  \nWhat also emerged from this study is the amount of information individuals \ninitially self-disclose to their potential mates is very different to other forms of dating \nboth online and offline. As highlighted in the introduction, when it comes to offline \nrelationships the social penetration theory initially proposed by Altman and Taylor \n(1973) and modified by others (e.g., Morton, Alexander, and Altman, 1976) \nessentially argues that relationships move from less intimate to more intimate \ninvolvement over time. The process has been described using an onion analogy, \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 28 \narguing that people self-disclose deeper and deeper aspects about themselves as the \nrelationship progresses. This theory discusses depth and breadth. According to social \npenetration theory, in the early phases of relationship development one moves with \ncaution, discussing less intimate topics and checking in the conversations for signs of \nreciprocity. Gradually one feels safer to admit to other aspects of themselves. This \nprocess arguably happens in chat rooms, discussion boards, IM and the like. \nMoreover, as mentioned earlier, researchers have found that this process often takes \nplace quicker, since people are potentially in a safer environment to reveal core \naspects of themselves (e.g., Cooper and Sportolari, 1997; Walther, 1995; Whitty, \n2003, 2004). \nThere is far less opportunity for relationships to develop on an internet dating \nsite in the way proposed by the social penetration theory. On an internet dating site \nthe profiles are set up in such as way to reveal both depth and breadth. For instance, \nwithin the profiles, individuals typically have to provide information about surface \nlevels aspects of themselves, such as, eye color, drinking and smoking habits, \nrelationship status, number and types of pets and occupation. In addition, they are \ngiven space to write more in-depth about themselves, where they are asked to describe \ntheir personality, interests (what they read, music they listen to and so forth), their \nideal date, their political persuasion. They are encouraged on these sites to open up \nabout all aspects of themselves online -- so that they will attract the most appropriate \nperson. Given the amount of information they are presented with it is no surprise the \nconversations that take place via email, telephone and so forth prior to the first \nmeeting are more to clarify information about the person as well as to arrange the \nmeeting. \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 29 \nTherefore, online dating is arguably even more removed from what people are \nused to when it comes to developing a relationship. There is not any real opportunity \nto test the waters gradually and check for reciprocity, instead, reciprocity is \ndetermined prior to communication with the individual. Therefore, as others have \nfound when it comes to presentation of self online \u2013 this can be quite strategic. In a \nway though, individuals have more control over their presentation on an internet \ndating site than any other space online. However, in turn, because the profile compiles \nall the information about the person in one chunk, it is easier to check back to. Hence, \nothers are less forgiving when there is a mismatch between the person they meet face-\nto-face and the person they were presented with in the profile. \n \n3.4 Limitations \n \n There are some limitations to this study. Given that this was a small sample \nsize the results are difficult to generalize. Moreover, different online sites are \nstructured in slightly different ways and some are geared towards specific interests \n(e.g., sites set up for certain religious orientations). Again, this makes it difficult to \ngeneralize these results to all online daters. Nonetheless, the rich data presented here \ndoes present some important insights as to how online daters present themselves and \ntheir expectations of how others ought to present themselves. Future research might \ntest out the claims made here by developing a survey which can be distributed to a \nvariety of types of online dating sites as well as a larger sample of individuals using \nthem. \n \n3.5 Conclusions \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 30 \n \n This research highlights that it is critical that social scientists should not \ndevelop one grand theory to explain how everyone presents themselves within \ncyberspace. Cyberspace is not one generic space. Rather it is important to consider \nhow different spaces online are constructed. This research points out that individuals \nare strategic in how they present themselves on an internet dating site; however, the \nstrategies employed here are different to others spaces like newsgroups. Although \nonline daters found this to be a space where they can experiment with how they \npresent their identity, in order for the relationship to continue offline successfully it \nwould seem that presentations of how they appear in everyday face-to-face situations \nare crucial.  \n \nRevealing the \u2018real\u2019 me \n 31 \nReferences \n \nAustralian Bureau of Statistics.
