EVOLVING FUZZY SYSTEMS AS AN EMERGING TOPIC IN\nFUZZY SYSTEM THEORY AND APPLICATIONS\nI T IS a well-recognized fact that the theory of fuzzy setsand systems, for the last four decades after the seminal pa-\nper by Professor Zadeh [1], has demonstrated its remarkable\nability to go beyond conventional information representation.\nIt resulted in a wide range of new formulations of practical\nproblems, such as fuzzy control, fuzzy clustering and classifica-\ntion, fuzzy modeling, and fuzzy optimization [2]. Historically,\nthe design of the fuzzy systems has been initially assumed to\nbe centered on expert knowledge [3]. During the 1990s, a new\ntrend emerged [4], [5] that offered techniques to make use of the\nexperimental data. This data-centered approach can be used to\nenhance and validate the existing expert knowledge or can also\nbe used to substitute its lack (as is the case with autonomous\nsystems, for example). Neurofuzzy and hybrid learning systems\nwere introduced, where fuzzy representation was integrated into\na neural learning architecture to bring linguistic meaning of the\nlearned information [5].\nAn important research challenge today is to develop such\ntechniques and methodologies that allow highly adaptive sys-\ntems to be self-developed from streaming data (collected in\nreal-time from sensory inputs, the Internet, the environment, or\nthe system monitoring itself). Conventional adaptive systems\nknown from control theory are usually applicable to a very nar-\nrow range of conditions (usually linear systems, specific Gaus-\nsian assumptions for noise and signals, etc.). Moreover, they\naddress the problems of adjustment of the system parameters\nand coefficients only and normally consider the system struc-\nture as a given prefixed entity. Fuzzy (and neurofuzzy) systems\noffer an enormous area for exploitation with the concept of\nfuzzily interlinked multimodel substructures that can be simple\n(e.g., linear) and thus, tractable. The newly emerging concept\nof dynamically evolving structures, which was, to some extent,\nalready applied to neural networks [6], brought a powerful new\nconcept of evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs). EFSs combine: 1) the\ninterpolation abilities of the fuzzy systems; 2) their flexibility;\n3) the linguistic interpretability of the fuzzy systems; and 4) the\nadaptive feature of the online learning techniques.\nThis new topic was introduced during the last decade [7], [8],\n[10] and quickly numerous applications to problems of mod-\neling, control, prediction, classification, and data processing in\na dynamically changing and evolving environment were also\ndeveloped, including some successful industrial applications\n[9]\u2013[17].\nDigital Object Identifier 10.1109\/TFUZZ.2008.2006743\nOne can formulate EFS as a synergy between fuzzy (or neuro-\nfuzzy) systems as expandable (evolvable) structures for informa-\ntion representation and real-time methods for machine learning.\nEFS are addressing nonstationary processes by computationally\nefficient algorithms for real-time applications. They consider a\ndynamically evolving family of locally valid subsystems that\ncan represent different situations or operating conditions. As\nAlan Turing said, \u201cthe Global order emerges from the chaos of\nlocal interactions.\u201d EFS aim at lifelong learning and adaptation,\nand self-organization (including system structure evolution) in\norder to adapt to (unknown and unpredictable) environments.\nEFS also address the problems of detecting temporal shifts and\ndrifts in the data patterns, adapting the learning scheme itself in\naddition to the evolution of the structure and parameters of the\nsystem.\nThere is a growing demand for technical implementations en-\nabled with such capabilities that an EFS offers in many applica-\ntion domains, such as: 1) autonomous vehicles and systems [19];\n2) intelligent sensors and agents [14]; 3) finance, economics, and\nsocial sciences [17]; 4) transportation systems [15]; 5) advanced\nmanufacturing and process industries such as chemical, petro-\nchemical, etc. [20]; and 6) biomedicine, bioinformatics, and\nnanotechnology [18].\nThe research effort and the number of publications in the area\nof EFSs are constantly growing through a series of organized\nevents such as dedicated symposia, workshops, and special ses-\nsions in leading international conferences related to different\nfacets of computational intelligence, and those were the moti-\nvating factors to organize this special section.\nII. PAPERS SUBMITTED AND SELECTED FOR THE SPECIAL\nSECTION\u2014AN OVERVIEW\nAs a result of the call, over 20 full-length papers were submit-\nted, which is a significant pool of contributions in an area that is\nin its infancy. A few of the papers were not directly relevant to\nthe call, which was deliberately formulated quite narrowly (aim-\ning to select the relatively small number of new contributions\nthat are focused and strong, rather than to give a broad picture\nand have fuzzy boundaries of the area that are yet to be more\nwidely recognized). A few papers were caught by the ambiguity\nof the adjective \u201cevolving\u201d in the title in the sense as established\nin the computational intelligence area, where the perception of\nthis term is related to evolutionary paradigms such as mutation,\ncrossover, and selection, while the context in which the term is\nused in this special section and in this emerging area is the one\nthat is related to the dynamic development of a system.\n1063-6706\/$25.00 \u00a9 2008 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore.

Restrictions apply.\nIEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 16, NO. 6, DECEMBER 2008 1391\nOut of the papers that cover different aspects of online de-\nsign of EFSs, seven papers were finally selected, which passed\nall rounds of anonymous review process typical for the TRANS-\nACTIONS. This number includes one paper coauthored by one\nof the Guest Editors and following the TRANSACTIONS\u2019 review\nprotocol, this paper was handled by an Associate Editor, picked\nup by the Editor-in-Chief directly. Thus, we followed strictly\nthe review procedure of the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY\nSYSTEMS.\nThe first paper in this special issue, titled \u201cFLEXFIS: A\nRobust Incremental Learning Approach for Evolving Takagi\u2013\nSugeno Fuzzy Models,\u201d by Edwin Lughofer, is a typical repre-\nsentative of the EFS area. It introduces a new approach to online\ndesign of a specific type of Takagi\u2013Sugeno fuzzy models, the\nso-called fuzzy basis function networks proposed by Wang and\nMendel. This is another example of the emerging plethora of\ndata-centered approaches to tackle online incremental learning\nand self-adaptation in fuzzy systems. The specific of this ap-\nproach is that it stems from the well-known vector quantization\n(VQ) clustering for developing the premise part of the fuzzy sys-\ntems. An evolving version of VQ (eVQ) is used in combination\nwith the fuzzily weighted recursive least-squares method.\nIn the paper, \u201cA Self-Evolving Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural\nNetwork With Online Structure and Parameter Learning,\u201d by\nChia-Feng Juang and Yu-Wei Tsao, a new self-evolving online\nstructure, which can also be seen as a neurofuzzy system or\neqivalently as a Takagi\u2013Sugeno-type fuzzy system, is proposed.\nThe main distinctive feature of this paper is that the system as-\nsumes interval type-2 fuzzy sets that supersede the well-known\n\u201cconventional\u201d or type-1 fuzzy sets. In a manner typical for the\nevolving systems, both the system structure and the system pa-\nrameters are self-developed (evolved) from data; this process\ncan start from \u201cscratch\u201d (i.e., from an empty rule base) and is\ndriven by an online clustering method. An efficient fuzzy set re-\nduction method is proposed and the learning is performed using\na rule-ordered Kalman filter.\nThe paper, \u201cIncremental Evolution of Fuzzy Grammar Frag-\nments to Enhance Instance Matching and Text Mining\u201d by\nTrevor Martin, Yun Shen, and Ben Azvine, differs from the\nother papers in its emphasis on text mining and on the use of\na fuzzy grammar. The area of extracting structured data from\nsections of unstructured text is of great importance for mining\ndata that are streamed from the Internet, multimedia communi-\ncations, etc. The novel approach presented in this paper falls into\nthe group of incremental learning methods, since the structure of\nthe fuzzy grammar is not known beforehand, but rather emerges\nfrom the streams of data by online learning. Results that sur-\npass an offline genetic programming technique, while working\nonline, were achieved on data streams collected from telephone\nconversations, e-mails, uniform resource locators, and others.\nThe paper \u201cAn Evolving Fuzzy Predictor for Industrial Ap-\nplications\u201d by Wilson Wang and Josip Vrbanek, introduces a\nrecursive version of the popular Levenberg\u2013Marquardt search\nalgorithm that is used to identify in an online mode the param-\neters of the evolving fuzzy system. Convergence of the pro-\nposed learning method has been proved. The system structure is\nevolved through online clustering. The proposed scheme is vali-\ndated on benchmark time series and on a problem of monitoring\nmachinery conditions and material property. Results suggest\nthat the proposed evolving fuzzy system is an effective and ac-\ncurate forecasting tool that can capture the system\u2019s dynamic\nbehavior and track the change in the system\u2019s characteristics.\nThe paper \u201cFully Evolvable Optimal Neurofuzzy Con-\ntroller Using Adaptive Critic Designs\u201d by Salman Mohagheghi,\nGanesh K. Venayagamoorthy, and Ronald G. Harley, demon-\nstrates an application of EFSs to control. The core of the con-\ntroller consists of a zero-order Takagi\u2013Sugeno fuzzy rule base.\nIn addition to this, core heuristic dynamic programming can\nbe applied that can ensure near-optimal control under vari-\nous operating conditions. The whole control scheme has been\ndemonstrated to perform efficiently and to lead to lower capital\ninvestment.\nThe paper \u201cEvolving Fuzzy-Rule-Based Classifiers from\nData Streams\u201d by Plamen Angelov and Xiaowei Zhou, intro-\nduces a new approach to classification of streaming data by the\nuse of EFSs. The proposed approach, called evolving Classifier\n(eClass), includes different architectures and online learning\nmethods. This family includes eClass0, which is very similar\nto the conventional classifiers where the consequent part of the\nfuzzy sets indicates the class label. eClass1 is a newly proposed\nmethod for regression over the features that has an option for a\nmulticlass output. An important property of eClass is the abil-\nity to start classifying and learning \u201cfrom scratch\u201d and to learn\nfrom examples. Not only the rule number but also the num-\nber of classes does not need to be prespecified and fixed. This\nwas demonstrated to be very efficient on the data from intru-\nsion detection, an example given at the KDD99 competition\nwhere eClass was able to learn from several hundreds to few\nthousands of data samples compared to the whole dataset of\nover five million samples. The proposed approach addresses the\npractical problems of the classification of streaming data (video,\nspeech, and sensory data generated from robotic, advanced in-\ndustrial applications, financial and retail chain transactions, and\nintruder detection, etc.).\nFinally, the paper \u201cEfficient Self-Evolving Evolutionary\nLearning for Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems\u201d by Cheng-Jian\nLin, Cheng-Hung Chen, and Chin-Teng Lin represents the evo-\nlutionary fuzzy systems with an approach called Self-Evolving\nEvolutionary Learning Algorithm (SEELA), which combines\nparticle-swarm optimization for both structure and parameter\nidentification of (neurofuzzy) systems. Furthermore, a hybrid\ncalled cooperative particle-swarm optimization is introduced.\nThis approach where the learning is offline has been applied\nto time series and nonlinear control. It demonstrates the differ-\nence in the principles of evolving and evolutionary as described\nbefore.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe Guest Editors would like to thank numerous authors who\nresponded to the call and anonymous reviewers who, with their\nexpert and visionary analyses, made it possible not only to select\na few successful papers, but also to shape the special issue and\nto direct the future research on EFSs.
