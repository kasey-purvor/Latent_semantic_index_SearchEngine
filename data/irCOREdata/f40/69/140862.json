This complicity was seen to be causal in\nmaintaining a series of defensive routines \u2013 routines that perpetuated the status quo.\nFurther reflection revealed many paradoxes in the world of projects and project\nmanagement.

A few years ago, we were conducting some case study research on the value of\nproject management in a project-based organisation that was contracted to design, develop\nand produce a major piece of military hardware, when we observed something we thought\nwas strange at the time \u2013 the long-standing non-adoption of some basic project\nmanagement practices and techniques that would have been beneficial, followed by the\nsubsequent adoption of one well-established technique being acclaimed throughout the\norganisation as \u2018best practice\u2019.\nWe tried to analyse this phenomenon using a variety of theoretical lenses \u2013 none of which\ncould satisfactorily explain what we had observed. We then attempted to construct our own\ntheorisation of the phenomenon, which we called \u2018complicity theory\u2019 because the\nphenomenon was only allowed to persist because of the complicity between the organisation\nand its major customer and between multiple levels of the organisation. But our theory of\ncomplicity proved to be very narrow in context \u2013 it is only useful where complicity exists.\nWhere it is absent there is no need for the theory.\n3We compared our original case study with another ongoing major project where many best\npractice\/accepted\/promising practices had been adopted \u2013 the construction of Heathrow\u2019s\nTerminal 5. At the time this was heralded as a great success and an example of a\nbreakthrough in project management. However, a year later the terminal opening was\ndescribed as a national disaster when multiple problems emerged that resulted in the\ncancellation of numerous flights and thousands of pieces of baggage being separated from\ntheir owners. So here was another paradox: how does a major success become a major\nfailure almost overnight?\nThe paradoxes highlighted above are just two examples of the many paradoxes in the world\nof projects and project management that researchers and practitioners in the domain have\nidentified. We realised that by focussing too narrowly on specific examples of paradox we\ncould only develop theories of limited scope. Given the prevalence of paradoxes in the world\nof projects perhaps we should move beyond labelling these phenomena to explore them and\nto contribute insights \u201cmore in tune with organisational complexity and ambiguity\u201d (Lewis,\n2000). We suggest that as researchers of projects and project management we should pay\nmore attention \u201cto the opportunities offered by tensions, oppositions, and contradictions\namong explanations of the same phenomenon\u201d (Poole and Van de Ven, 1989, 562) to help\nbuild theories of project management and project organising.\nThe Improvement Paradox\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines a paradox as:\n\u201cA seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition which when investigated may\nprove to be well founded or true; a statement or proposition which, despite sound (or\napparently sound) reasoning from acceptable premises, leads to a conclusion that seems\n4logically unacceptable or self-contradictory; a person or thing that combines contradictory\nfeatures or qualities.\u201d\nHarvey (1988) citing Rapaport and Chammah (1970), notes that:\n\u201cParadoxes are only paradoxes because they are based on a logic or rationale that is\ndifferent from what we understand or expect. Discovering the aberrant logic not only\ndestroys the paradoxical quality, but also offers alternative ways for coping with similar\nsituations.\u201d (Harvey, 1988, p.20).\nAs Poole and Van de Ven (1989) state:\n\u201cMost contemporary theory construction methodologies attempt to build internally\nconsistent theories of limited scope. Relatively little attention has been paid to the\nopportunities offered by the tension, oppositions, and contradictions among\nexplanations of the same phenomenon.\u201d (p562)\nThey go on to distinguish four ways of working with paradox: (1) accept the paradox and use\nit constructively; (2) clarify levels of analysis; (3) temporally separate the two levels; and (4)\nintroduce new terms to resolve the paradox.\nElsewhere, it has been suggested that significant advances in management and\norganisation theory might require us to better address paradoxes inherent in human\nbehaviour and their social organisations (Cameron and Quinn, 1988). Lewis (2000) cites a\ngrowing number of researchers (e.g. Handy, 1994; Kets de Vries, 1995; Koot, Sabelis and\nYbema, 1996; Hatch & Erlich, 1993; and Vince & Broussine, 1996) who have studied\nparadox. She notes that these researchers have abandoned the idea that change is a\nsmooth, linear and planned journey. Rather they point out that contradictions both hamper\nand encourage organisational development. Lewis laments the fact that whilst the term is\nused by many in management research to the extent that it is in danger of becoming a\n5clich\u00e9, few researchers explore paradox at greater depth.\nShe constructs a framework based on insights from psychology, philosophy and\norganisational studies around this to help understand key elements of paradox. She claims\nthe framework clarifies: (1) how paradoxical tensions arise from polarised cognitive or social\nconstructions, (2) how actors\u2019 defensive reactions might fuel reinforcing cycles, and (3) how\nactors can avoid becoming stuck in these paralysing and often vicious cycles via greater\ncognitive and behavioural complexity. She notes that formal logic is based on either\/or\nthinking which is incapable of understanding the intricacies of paradox (Ford and Ford,\n1994).\nFor the case we present here, there is a clear difference between our expectations and the\nreality of practice. The logic of our expectations was based on what we now recognise as a\nbias of our research. That is, there is a fundamental goodness and desirability of improving\nPM practices. Indeed, the work took place under the heading of \u2018The Value of Project\nManagement.\u2019 Our finding, that improvement was neither rationalised as good nor inherently\ndesirable clearly presented a paradox for us \u2013 the improvement paradox.\nSummary of the observed phenomenon\nThe project we studied was to design, develop and eventually manufacture a new piece of\nmilitary hardware. Right from the outset in 1996, it was subject to continual slippage and\ncost escalation. Just two years later the contractor informed the client that it was unlikely to\nmeet timescales and a revised in-service date was agreed for March 2005. There followed a\nseries of renegotiations of the contract terms as both sides revised their expectations for the\nproject and introduced new approaches. By May 2002, for example, a new incremental\n6approach to product delivery was adopted, that reflected a revised assessment of operations\nrequirements. By the end of the year further slippage in both budget and time was disclosed\nby the contractor attributed to the underestimation of technology risks, which placed them\nunder severe \u2018cost pressures,\u2019 making further contract negotiation necessary. The first full\nproduct test date was moved back from mid-2002 to end 2002, then to the second half of\n2003. The situation failed to improve despite a plethora of advice resulting from 11 separate\nreviews that presented 255 issues to the management team. An independent audit report on\nthe project described the situation as follows:\n\u201cDifficulties on (the X project) stem from \u2018the design challenge being hugely\nunderestimated by industry, perhaps as a result of continuing to see the project as if\nit were the adaptation of an existing [product], as it was originally intended to be,\nwhen in fact 95% of the [product] is new.\u201d\n\u201cAgainst the background of the fixed price contract, the consequent cost pressure\nand financial losses provided little incentive on (the contractor) to deliver. These\ndifficulties were compounded by a weak programme management culture which\nlacked transparency, neglected or overrode project control systems and disciplines,\nand produced forecasts that lacked depth and reality.\u201d\nThe effect of this was to throw the project into complete crisis and in 2003 the two parties\nagreed, in effect, to draw a line under it and come to a new agreement, which accepted the\nslippage (by then 71 months) and agreed to share the costs between the two parties. The\ncontract was in effect re-baselined and a new contract negotiated. New revised agreed\nmilestones were introduced \u2013 first complete test June 2004; award of manufacturing contract\nend 2005; in-service date 2009.\nEvidence of practices within the organisation prior to 2003 included comments that:\n7\u201cThe client was worried about performance. The company was worried about cost.\nNo-one worried about schedule.\u201d\nGiven the continuing delays, this was key to the idea of collusion \u2013 each party trying to\nprotect its own interests, whilst missing one of the major issues that was central to the\noverall success of the project.\nSimilarly, much attention was given to the prevailing \u2018technical\u2019 culture, where the focus was\non achieving technical excellence rather than meeting the needs of a business case:\n\u201cWe had basic [project management] mechanisms but the \u2018culture\u2019 was not there. I\nwas fairly typical of managers who were not concerned with business case \u2013 just did\nnumbers to save getting ******** by the boss\u2026 We used to aim to surpass\ncustomers\u2019 expectations \u2013 regardless of whether he wanted the features and the\ngold-plating.\u201d\nProject managers described the climate at the time as follows:\n\u201cIt was a terrible place to work \u2013 there was fear, the project was a dead duck and\nmorale was very low.\u201d\nand\n\u201cThe programme was out of control \u2013 people weren\u2019t being true to each other about\nwhat could be achieved \u2013 either in our own organisation or the customer\u2019s\norganisation. We both wanted to understand that \u2013 that was as much of a driver as\nthe performance itself.\u201d\nThe organisation responded by initiating no fewer than 11 separate audits and reviews of the\nproject, which required over 170 high-level actions for management. This, initially, slowed\n8progress even further; paradoxical in the short-term, but not the main issue of interest to this\ndiscussion.\nAs a result of the restructuring of the contract, development, manufacture and service\ncontracts were separated out and project reforms were introduced. These project reforms\nincluded more openness with the client, collocation of staff, introduction of \u2018anchor\nmilestones\u2019 as key progress check points, a joint risk register, and Earned Value (EV).\nThese reforms were embedded in a robust and open partnering approach that improved\naccess, information, communication and behaviours, and placed a greater emphasis on\ndelivery, cost minimisation and schedule adherence. One manager stated the benefits of this\nas:\n\u201cWe now have control and predictability and can understand cause and effect in the\nschedule. The customer particularly likes that. We used to be cheesed off about his\nrequirements constantly changing. It [the new approach] reduces flexibility but is\nnow easier as you can show the effects of particular changes. Planning becomes a\nheuristic tool as there are knock-on effects.\u201d\nIn addition, the organisation put in place a behavioural programme, which aimed to\nlegitimise and professionalise project management in addition to a leadership development\nprogramme and partnering development programme. However, the changes were relatively\nstraightforward. One manager commented:\n\u201cOur objective was very simple \u2013 we needed conformance to a fairly basic level of\nproceduralisation.\u201d\nWithin the contractor's company the reform programme is held up as a great success. The\nproject is now seen as exemplifying \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018best\u2019 practice throughout the parent\norganisation. A prime outcome of the reforms is that the project is no longer under threat of\nclosure. The company retained the business and the project has now has fallen \u2018below the\nradar\u2019 with the client. The relationship with the client is much better. Planning disciplines\n9have been implemented. People working on the project appear motivated and confident in\nboth the product and the new processes.\nHowever, if you scratch below the surface, there is very little critique of what has been\nachieved in comparison to external benchmarks. We found very low levels of knowledge and\ncertification in the firm. Management qualifications were not recognised as valuable (there\nwas one MBA among several thousand staff). The customer was similarly\n(un)knowledgeable. In PM maturity terms, they have moved from chaotic to the use of some\nbasic processes. More surprisingly, there is no desire or requirement for ongoing\nimprovement:\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll move the bar much beyond where it has gone already.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t spend any more money on comparing a good programme with a bad\nprogramme \u2013 we\u2019ll send them out into the hinterland as disciples and bring in more\njunior people to train up.\u201d (Project Director).\nand, despite the reforms, the project still showed both schedule and costs increasing (albeit\nat a slower rate than before). However, the complicity in stagnating performance was well\nestablished in the organisation again. Data from the 21 project managers surveyed showed\nthat:\n\uf0b7 15 of the 21 agreed and 1 strongly agreed with the statement that they were well\ntrained (5 neutral).\n\uf0b7 14 of the 21 agreed and 2 strongly agreed with the statement that they had suitable\neducation to fulfil their jobs (5 neutral).\n\uf0b7 12 of the 21 agreed and 3 strongly agreed that management provides advanced\ndevelopment and training programmes for members of the organisation.\n10\nThis was despite the fact that there was not a single recognised (APM\/PMI) qualification\namong the 180 project office staff. We interpret this difference as a form of collusion.\nFurther, this was reflected in the views of the organisational PM capability:\n\uf0b7 14 of the 21 agreed and 2 strongly agreed with the statement that the organisation is\nviewed as having a very strong management capability (3 neutral and 2 disagreed).\n\uf0b7 11 agreed and 7 strongly agreed that the organisation had very high PM standards.\n\uf0b7 15 agreed and 2 strongly agreed that this organisation has superior project\nmanagement practices.\nThe benchmark here was taken as knowledge of the bodies of knowledge (APM\/PMI). Not\none of the interviewees demonstrated such knowledge. The last statement provides another\ninteresting contrast with the performance that the project was again demonstrating. On the\nsubject of performance:\n\uf0b7 Only 5 agreed that the project management practices of the organisation consistently\nexceed expectations (14 neutral and 2 disagreed).\nThe self-delusion of the project members was evidenced by:\n\uf0b7 8 agreeing and 2 strongly agreeing with the statement that \u2018Projects in this\norganisation are more successful than in other organisations I know\u2019 (9 were neutral\nand 2 disagreed).\n\uf0b7 12 agreeing and 5 strongly agreeing that the organisation delivered high quality\nproducts and services\n\uf0b7 12 agreeing and 2 strongly agreeing that projects were successfully delivered\n\uf0b7 12 agreeing (5 neutral, 4 disagreeing) that projects managed by the organisation\nconsistently deliver on their objectives\n11\nHowever, when broken down we see that this was mostly in terms of technical\nspecifications:\n\uf0b7 11 agreed and 2 strongly agreed that projects achieved their technical objectives.\nWhereas:\n\uf0b7 only 5 agreed that they met their schedule objectives (10 disagreed and 1 strongly\ndisagreed).\n\uf0b7 9 disagreed, 1 strongly disagreed that they met budget objectives.\nIn relation to their opinion of the clients\u2019 view of projects:\n\uf0b7 11 agreed and 10 were neutral in relation to the statement: clients are consistently\nsatisfied by the process by which projects are managed.\nWhilst it can be argued \u2018who is the client\u2019 here, the client itself had no reason to be satisfied\nwith a renegotiated and very late project that was continuing to slip.\nOverall, what we witnessed was complicity between the client and the contractor (just stay\nout of the press), propped up by complicity within the contracting organisation (it is a good\nnews story), and complicity in the project team (we are well qualified, knowledgeable and\ndoing well). The result is that poor processes and poor performance were allowed to\ncontinue with no obvious requirement for improvement.\nWhat theory could help explain this phenomenon?\nWe puzzled over this phenomenon and tried to analyse it using a variety of theoretical\nlenses. These were not intended to be an exhaustive selection, but are illustrative of some\napproaches that we hoped would enlighten the phenomenon of interest. This is the\ndifference between our expectations (poor performance leading to improvements being\nactively pursued) and the reality of the case (performance condoned leading to no further\nimprovements sought). These lenses were innovation diffusion theory, rational choice\n12\ntheory, institutional theory (including the fads and fashions literature), and organisational\nlearning.\nInnovation diffusion theory\nDiffusion theory concerns the role adopted by different actors \u2013 whether early adopters or\nlaggards (e.g. Rogers 1983). The first phase of the diffusion of an innovative practice sees it\nadopted by relatively few innovators \u2013 the early adopters. Once the efficacy of the practice is\ndemonstrated by these early adopters it is taken up by other organisations and so diffuses\nmore generally over time until it becomes standard practice. What we observed above does\nnot seem to fit easily with this since the organisation in question spent many years avoiding\ntaking up the good practice that had already diffused widely in other project settings (both in\nother parts of the organisation and more widely). In order for new practices to be adopted\nthey must first be found in some kind of search activity. It appears that there was little\nattempt to search out better practice until the major crisis in 2003 when the threat of\nprogramme closure forced them to seek alternatives. Once these were implemented,\nhowever, there was no further change. Perhaps the actors in the case organisation could\nsimply be viewed as laggards, but this is not necessarily helpful in explaining the full range\nof behaviours.\nInstitutional theory would suggest that organisations in the same industry exhibit\nisomorphism \u2013 i.e. they will adopt similar working practices (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). On\nthe one hand diffusion of practices seen as best practice takes place encouraged by the\nlegitimacy argument. The introduction of earned value by the project organisation was\nlegitimised by the widespread and successful use of the technique in the company\u2019s US\nbusiness. Furthermore, a new manager, who had previously worked in the US business,\nwas appointed to oversee the changes. On the other hand, the benefits achieved by the\nadoption of successful practice may inhibit the take up of superior practices in the future\n(Arthur, 1989). In this case, the non-adoption of superior practice in the future is not so much\n13\na result of the successful adoption of the EV technique but a deliberate strategy not to go\nbeyond what has already been achieved.\nAt the level of the organisation some practices become institutionalised as rules \u2013 \u2018the way\nwe do things around here.\u2019 Such practices become embedded and are very resistant to\nchange (Oliver,1992). It appears that the new \u2018good practice\u2019 had become institutionalised\nas a rule in the organisation and hence will be hard to change in the future.\nRational choice\nRational choice approaches to the adoption of new practices and their impact on\nperformance, include the behavioural theory of the firm (e.g. Cyert & March 1963; March &\nSimon 1967) and evolutionary economics (e.g. Nelson & Winter 1982). These suggest that\nthe primary driver for organisational innovations is the identification of performance gaps.\nWhen a firm\u2019s actual performance drops below its desired performance level, determined\neither internally by past performance or internal targets (e.g. Lant & Mezias 1992) or by\ncomparison to an external reference group (e.g. Massini et al 2005), this performance gap\nwill lead managers to search for new practices to improve performance. Once the new\npractice has been adopted and put into use, managers will compare before-and-after\nperformance to determine whether it should be retained or discarded. Thus, rational choice\npresents the identification, selection, evaluation, and retention or discarding of management\npractices as relatively straightforward for managers, who should thus be viewed as rational\nactors who search for new practices to maintain or improve organisational performance.\nThis clearly has not happened in our case study organisation except when forced. The\nproject was performing poorly for many years (problems identified in 1998 through to final\nmelt-down in 2003) before any change was implemented. Furthermore, despite the\nopportunity for further improvement, none was taken.\n14\nThe improvement paradox relies not on one rationality, but more than one to be present.\nWhilst there was logic in our expectation, it clearly wasn\u2019t the same logic as that used by the\nmanagers in the case company. The people interviewed were all highly rational individuals,\nwho exhibited a highly developed sense of professionalism. We are not then able to reject\nrational choice theory. Rather, the theory needs qualification for this context to provide any\nuseful explanatory power.\nThe institutional approach\nAn alternative perspective to rational choice is the institutional approach, which derives from\nsociology, and shifts the main focus of attention from rational choice and technical efficiency\nto pressures from the organisation\u2019s external environment (e.g. Dimaggio and Powell 1983).\nThe institutional approach views all economic activity as embedded in social contexts. Whilst\nfirms may aspire to rational solutions to performance gaps, because of uncertainty about\ncompeting practices and performance outcomes or alternative practices that might plausibly\nachieve the same outcomes, they may be uncertain how to achieve them. So that managers\nappear rational and progressive according to \u201cnorms of rationality\u201d (March & Olsen, 1976),\nthey will tend to adopt institutionalised organisational practices, those \u201ctaken-for-granted\u201d as\nthe most appropriate means of improving performance, and hence perceived as legitimate\nby key institutional actors (e.g. Abrahamson, 1996).\nFrom an institutional perspective, the explanations accompanying the adoption of a new\npractice become important because explaining how the practice helps managers achieve the\ndesired performance outcomes legitimises the practice (Green, 2004) and is essential to\nconstructing certain practices as \u201ctaken for granted\u201d (e.g. Green, 2004; Suddaby &\nGreenwood, 2005). Hence, a focus on managerial discourse often accompanies an\ninstitutional analysis of diffusion and adoption of management innovations. The\nmanagement fashion perspective (e.g. Abrahamson, 1991; Abrahamson, 1996; Abrahamson\n& Fairchild, 1997; Strang & Macy, 2001; Strang & Still, 2004) focuses particularly on the role\n15\nof rhetoric and social networks in the diffusion of new practices, and the presence of\n\u201cbandwagons\u201d, or the number of adopters (e.g. Abrahamson & Rosenkopf, 1997). Managers\nmust therefore heed key institutional actors, including consulting firms, management gurus,\nbusiness mass-media publications, and business schools, who provide important sources of\ninformation for managers about what other firms are doing. On this last point, there is an\nunderlying assumption that managers are being exposed to these \u2018key institutional actors.\u2019\nIn the case, the managers appeared insulated from what other firms were doing, inhibiting\nany \u2018search\u2019 for improvement opportunities.\nInstitutional theory further specifies that the diffusion and adoption of management practices\nwill be influenced by mimetic, coercive, and normative pressures from the external\nenvironment (e.g. Scott, 2001) to adopt certain practices. Mimetic pressures are pressures\nfor firms to imitate the practices of other, usually successful, firms; coercive pressures are\npressures to avoid sanctions from regulatory agencies and other institutional actors;\nnormative pressures are pressures to conform to perceived professional norms. Institutional\nactors are thus important in driving the diffusion and adoption of management practices (e.g.\nPaauwe & Boselie, 2005) and there are strong sanctions associated with failing to adopt\ncertain practices (Nelson et al. 2004). However, diffusion and adoption is not only a social\nprocess, since technical, economic, and socio-psychological forces jointly shape the\ndemand for new practices, and diffusion and adoption of practice is ultimately driven by the\nneed to respond to organisational performance gaps.\nIn this case the focus of the theory is on adoption of practices, rather than explaining non-\nadoption as we have seen here. For instance, whilst there has clearly been a \u2018project\nmanagement bandwagon\u2019, the case organisation has taken conscious decisions to ignore it.\nThis in itself is insightful and provided the identification of a bias that we, the researchers,\nhad taken into the case. We were researching \u2018The Value of Project Management\u2019 \u2013 itself\nan indication that we (the researchers) believed the practices under that heading were\n16\nvaluable. Furthermore, as teachers and consultants, we had a stake in promoting the value\nof PM practices. In addition, we had assumed that the case would be about \u2018change\u2019, rather\nthan \u2018no-change.\u2019 Lastly, whilst we were regularly exposed to the mimetic, coercive and\nnormative pressures of external agents of change for organisations, it was wrong to assume\nthat the managers interviewed were likewise connected.\nThe organisational learning approach\nAnother perspective is provided by the organisational learning literature, which accepts that\norganisational issues create barriers to learning and improvement. We would suggest that\nthis perspective is the most useful to help us understand the case presented above. In\nparticular we draw on the concept of defensive routines (Argyris, 1993) to explain the non-\nadoption of promising practices from elsewhere. Organisational defensive routines exist in\nboth private and governmental organisations, but few studies have been undertaken about\nhow to overcome them (Argyris, 1993, p.242). Those few that do offer advice seem to\nsuggest either bypassing the defensive routines and covering up the bypass or else in acting\nin ways that actually strengthen the routines rather than get rid of them.\n\u201cAn organisational defensive routine is any policy or action that inhibits individuals,\ngroups, inter-groups or organisations from experiencing embarrassment or threat\nand at the same time prevents the actors from identifying the causes of\nembarrassment or threat. Organisational defensive routines are anti-learning and\nover-protective\u201d (Argyris, 1993, p.15).\nThe immediate effect of such policies, practices and behaviours is to inhibit the detection\nand correction of error. A second-order effect is to inhibit problem solving and decision\nmaking. The third order effect is to lower effective organisational performance.\n17\nThe case above can be seen as a clear example of this. Despite the embarrassment of\ncontinually being seen to be over budget and behind schedule the situation was allowed to\ncontinue for many years because the organisation refused to experience the\nembarrassment. The refusal to become embarrassed by the poor performance led both\nsides to ignore the signals. There was complicity in this. This refusal to accept the obvious\ninhibited problem solving and decision making. Better to turn a blind eye than to see the\nproblem because then something would have to be done about it. Better not to hear the\nnews that things were going badly. Managers commented:\n\u201cThe company didn\u2019t ask questions because it didn\u2019t want the answers.\u201d\n\u201cIn a programme that on day 1 was going to fail, the culture was \u2018don\u2019t want to hear\nbad news\u2019.\u201d\nIn a study of defensive routines in government, Argyris (1993, p. 19) observed that in\n\u201cneither the official policies nor the administrators' espoused values was there\nencouragement to deceive, to manipulate or to distort information. Nevertheless, the actions\nwere robust; they appeared in spite of (and even because of) their deviancy from ideas in\ngood currency on how to administer governmental agencies.\u201d\nIn a similar way neither the policies nor the espoused values of the employees and\nmanagers in the company we studied encouraged them to actively deceive, manipulate or\ndistort information. They simply ignored the information coming from external assessments.\nTheir denial was robust.\nAccording to Argyris (1993), organisational defensive routines are caused by a circular, self-\nreinforcing process in which individuals\u2019 theories in use produce individual strategies of\nbypass and cover-up, which reinforce the individuals\u2019 theories in use. Thus the explanation\nfor organisational defensive routines is both individual and organisational. This means that it\nis necessary to change both organisational and individual routines to achieve sustained\nchange of behaviour. The reform programmes that the company undertook addressed this\n18\nby creating a standardised approach to project management in the programme so that all\nindividuals operated in the same way and to the same norms. Our interviews confirmed this\n\u2013 individuals were pleased (for a very limited time) to adopt the new practices as they could\nsee benefit from them, and their theories in use became closer to the espoused theories in\nthe new situation. However, this was not sustained and the mechanism did appear to have\nmore complexity than previously stated. We therefore sought further explanation of the\ncauses of these defensive routines.\nOther lenses\nWe note that there are many other lenses that could have been applied to providing\nexplanation for the phenomenon observed. The punctuated equilibrium model (Gersick,\n1991) is one such explanation. In this model, inertia maintains an organisation in\nequilibrium, until a major event occurs that requires a change. Once that event has passed,\nthe state of equilibrium returns, possibly at a different equilibrium point. Lindahl and Rehn\n(2007) note that projects, \u201c\u2026despite being generally seen as the most action-oriented way of\norganising, are usually conducted under a bureaucratic superstructure based on foundations\nof stability, predictability and success\u201d (p.250). They introduce the term \u2018yield point\u2019 to\ndescribe the point at which a project goes into crisis to an extent that established protocols\nand routines can no longer deal with them. The action required to turn the project back on\ntrack will require a step out of the institutionalised web of intra and inter-organisational rules,\nor the rules themselves have to be reformulated and renegotiated. In this case, whether the\nbureaucratic superstructure was based on foundations of \u2018stability predictability and success\u2019\nis doubtful. It is far more likely to have evolved based on custom and practice. The yield\npoint issue is useful however. It was the publication of the results of an audit of the\nperformance from an external third party that threw the project into crisis and triggered the\nyield point.\n19\nWhilst the punctuated equilibrium model does describe at a high level what we saw\nhappening in the case, our observed phenomenon concerns \u2018lack of change\u2019, rather than\n\u2018change\u2019 per se. In addition, we found interesting the logic(s) present in the improvement\nparadox, in the project context.\nAs we attempted to understand the logics present in the improvement paradox, we noted the\nimportance of the level of complicity of multiple actors in their reasoning. For this reason we\nsuggested a \u2018theory of complicity\u2019 as a contributor to this understanding.\nTowards a \u2018theory of complicity\u2019\nHaving seen that the behaviour being exhibited was not explained by innovation diffusion\ntheory, was counter-rational to normative views, and was not following the path that a\nconsideration of institutional theory or fads and fashions would lead us to expect, a partial\nexplanation was obtained through the examination of the construction and usage of\ndefensive routines as barriers to organisational learning. This partial explanation is not\nsatisfactory, however, as it does not address the causes of those barriers. Therefore, for\nboth theoretical and practical purposes, some further explanation is required.\nThe data provides evidence of complicity in the performance and rate of change at multiple\nlevels; between the client and the contracting organisation, between the organisation and\nthe project, and within the project hierarchy. This complicity is causal to the failure to remove\ndefensive routines. During the transition phase in 2003, complicity was removed at all levels,\nand process improvement took place. Complicity was then re-established and no further\nchanges were made. The proposition we derive is:\nProcesses and practices will remain within the defensive routines of the organisation\nwhere there is complicity for them to do so.\n20\nComplicity is an active state achieved where the parties to the complicity collude to allow\nit to be so. The state of complicity is evidenced by the statements supporting \u2018no\nchange\u2019 that were made both pre- and post-2003. \u2018Active\u2019 indicates that whilst there is\nno change, the decision not to change had been consciously made and a rationale built\nfor this decision. It is causal to the defensive routines.\nThe limitations of the \u2018theory of complicity\u2019\nWith this proposition in mind, it is appropriate to see if it may have a wider currency. For\ninstance, there is concern about the level of improvements that are being achieved in project\nperformance. Standish\u2019s \u201cChaos\u201d reports chronicle the outcome of IT projects (PM Network,\n2003, The Standish Group International Inc., 2004). The project outcomes are also\nmeasured by their completion on time, budget and quality. The TechRepublic Study by the\nGartner Group paints a similar picture. In 2000, 1275 North American IT specialists were\nasked about the outcome of internal IT projects in terms of their achievement of time, cost\nand quality objectives. The picture is consistently inconsistent \u2013 there are some\norganisations making great progress with improving process and performance, but the data\nfrom these studies does suggest that there are a considerable number who are making little\nprogress. We speculate that complicity provides one possible root cause for such a situation,\nand that further research would demonstrate if this was in fact the case.\nOur thinking about the observed phenomenon led us to speculate whether project contexts\nencourage the behaviours we had observed. Indeed we found that studies of mega-projects\nin transportation demonstrated that key stakeholders from owner organisations, government\nofficials and contractors cooperated to use less than best practice project procedures\n(Flyvberg et al, 2003).\n21\nHowever, we also had investigated another ongoing mega-project case where many best\npractice\/accepted\/promising practices had been adopted \u2013 the construction of Heathrow\u2019s\nTerminal 5 (T5). BAA, the client and owner of Heathrow Airport, implemented a strategic\nprogramme of capability building to improve the management of its projects and in particular\nthe management of T5, its biggest ever project. They learned from previous projects,\nindividuals and organisations that contributed to the innovative approach used to manage\nthe T5 project. Between 2000 and 2002, BAA conducted in-depth analyses of every major\nUK construction project (over \u00a31billion) in the previous ten years and on every international\nairport that had been opened in the previous ten years. This research showed that none of\nthem had been delivered on time and within budget or to the quality standards expected.\nBAA realised that the only way to deliver T5 was to change the rules of the game by creating\na set of behaviours that allowed people to come up with innovative solutions to problems.\nNot only did BAA learn internally from its past projects, but it learnt externally as well from\nother airport projects, from other sectors and leading-edge practice in supply chain\nmanagement and project management (Davies et al 2006). This exposure to the external\nenvironment (previously termed \u2018searching\u2019) and the resulting analysis removed possible\ncomplicity from a substantial part of the project.\nAt the time this was heralded as a great success and an example of a breakthrough\ninnovation in project management. However, a year later the terminal opening was\ndescribed as a national disaster when multiple problems emerged that resulted in the\ncancellation of numerous flights and thousands of pieces of baggage being separated from\ntheir owners. So here was another paradox: how does a major success become a major\nfailure almost overnight?\nThe improvement paradox in project contexts\n22\nWe had observed a paradox in our case study \u2013 what we saw now was that paradoxes were\nmore commonplace in project contexts than in just our original case. For instance, it is one\nof the paradoxes that the project form of organisation is lauded as the one most likely to\ndeliver innovative solutions whilst at the same time being resistant to changes in its own\nstructure and processes. O\u2019Neill et al (1988) suggest that organisations operating in highly\nuncertain environments need to be extremely flexible and able to adapt and change their\npractices rapidly to meet the demands of a changing environment. This would imply the\nrapid adoption of good or best practice was a necessary factor for survival (depending on\nthe level of competition in the market). Thus one would expect project-based organisations,\nwhich typically work in an unstable and uncertain environment, to be flexible and open to\nrapid adoption of new practices. Our case is certainly not unique in demonstrating the\nopposite \u2013 what we have termed the improvement paradox.\nConclusions\nThis paper began with the identification of an observed phenomenon, that we termed \u2018the\nimprovement paradox.\u2019 It occurred in a project-based organisation that was apparently in\nurgent need of improving its PM practices and performance. Whilst the need was evident,\nthis wasn\u2019t matched by activity within the organisation to implement improvements. Only\nwhen the organisation reached a crisis were limited changes implemented. It then returned\nto a state where no further changes were likely. Such a scenario is not that unusual and is\nwell documented in the change management literature. However, we were concerned that\nwhilst this helped provide a description of what we had seen, it didn\u2019t provide greater\nunderstanding of this paradox in this context.\nThe existence of the paradox was the result of two logical processes coming to different\nconclusions on the scenario. One logic was that of the researcher. Using Harvey\u2019s (1988)\nterms, we \u2018uncovered the aberrant logic\u2019 in our initial assumption of the inherent goodness\nand desirability of improving PM practices. Indeed, the bias towards \u2018organisations self-\n23\nevidently must want to adopt promising \/ best \/ accepted practices\u2019 is widespread. Moreover,\nwe (the researchers) are actors in an external environment that actively promotes\nimprovement, and provides mimetic, coercive and normative pressures on an organisation to\nimprove. The organisation, through complicity, had insulated itself from these pressures.\nThis meant that the logic of the defensive routine prevailed. It was only when an external\nreport caused a crisis in the project organisation that the complicity was temporarily lifted,\nthe routines were suspended, and change could be made.\nProject environments may be particularly susceptible to complicity, and this may contribute\nto understanding why the performance of organisations in project terms is so variable, and\nheadline rates of performance demonstrate only limited improvements. Contrary to the\nliterature, project environments, which are full of uncertainty, do not appear to be the locus\nof rapid adoption of new practice. We further suggest that this is due in part to the desire for\nstability in an uncertain environment. Where the technology is uncertain or where\nrelationships with stakeholders are uncertain then project members seek stability in the\nprocesses they use. There is in-built desire not to \u2018rock the boat.\u2019 Even when crises arise\nthat force a change, the change in underlying behaviour is only temporary, followed by a\nreturn to old ways of working. New defensive routines emerge to replace the old ones. It\ntakes an enormous effort to make sustainable changes in this environment. The T5 project\nappeared to offer hope that such sustainable change in behaviour may be possible given the\nright environment. But, in another paradox, the good behaviours and practices that had\nserved the project so well in the construction phase seemed to be abandoned as it moved\ninto operation.\nSo, in starting with one paradox in a single project we have unearthed several others. We\ntried a number of theoretical lenses to try to make sense of the paradox. By itself each\napproach was inadequate to explain what we had observed. The combination of the \u2018theory\nof complicity\u2019, which led to the defensive routines we had witnessed, combined with our own\n24\nbias as researchers, did provide a credible explanation.\nAs we seek more intricate explanations for the phenomena we observe in project contexts\nperhaps we should try to adopt strategies based on the paradox framework. In our own\ncontinuing efforts to better understand the paradoxes we have come across, there is indeed\nsome notion that whilst they don\u2019t provide \u2018the way forward\u2019, at least they do provide a clue\nto a way forward.\nReferences\nAbrahamson, E., 1991, Managerial fads and fashions: The diffusion and refection of\ninnovations, Academy of Management Review, Vol. 16, No. 3, pp. 586-612.\nAbrahamson, E., 1996, Management fashion, Academy of Management Review, Vol. 21\nIssue 1, pp. 254-285.\nAbrahamson, E, Fairchild, G., 1999, Management fashion: Lifecycles, triggers, and collective\nlearning processes, Administrative Science Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 708-740.\nAbrahamson, E., Rosenkopf, L., 1997, Social network effects on the extent of innovation\ndiffusion: a computer simulation, Organization Science, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 289-309.\nArgyris, C., 1993, Knowledge for Action: A Guide to Overcoming Barriers to Organizational\nChange, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.\nArthur, W.B., 1989, Competing Technologies, Increasing Returns, and Lock-In by Historical\nEvents, The Economic Journal, Vol. 99, No. 394 (Mar., 1989), pp. 116-131.\nCameron, K.S., Quinn, R.E., 1988.
