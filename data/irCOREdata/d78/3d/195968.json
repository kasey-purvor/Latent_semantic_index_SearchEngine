A statistical study is presented of the unstable pro-\nton populations, which contain the free energy required to\ndrive small-scale poloidal mode ULF waves in the magne-\ntosphere, observed at invariant latitudes of 60\u25e6 to 80\u25e6. The\ndata are all in the form of Ion Distribution Functions (IDFs)\namassed over\u223c6 years using the CAMMICE (MICS) instru-\nment on the Polar spacecraft, and cover proton energies of\n1 keV to 328 keV. The free energy contained in the unsta-\nble, positive gradient regions of the IDFs is available to drive\nresonant wave growth. The results show that positive gradi-\nent regions in IDFs on magnetic field lines corresponding to\nthe lower invariant latitudes in the range under study occur\npredominantly in the afternoon sector at proton energies of\n5 keV to 20 keV. In the morning and dawn sectors positive\ngradient regions are seen with a typical proton energy range\nof 5 keV to 45 keV. While the proton energy peaks in the af-\nternoon sector at around \u223c7 keV the morning sector has two\npeaks occurring at\u223c 10 keV and\u223c20\u201330 keV. The technique\nof Baddeley et al. (2004), employed to quantify the free en-\nergy in each IDF, found that as invariant latitude increased\nthe free energy contained in the positive gradient regions fell.\nPositive gradient regions in the afternoon sector decrease in\nnumber with invariant latitude at a faster rate than those in\nthe morning sector. The majority of positive gradient regions\nhad free energy values of >1010 J with many at the lowest\ninvariant latitudes having free energies of in excess of 1011 J.\nPositive gradient regions at proton energies of >100 keV are\nrarely observed, and have free energies of typically <109 J,\nwhich is too small to produce high m ULF waves of signifi-\ncant amplitude.\nKeywords.

Wilson\n(mew6@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nUltra Low Frequency (ULF) waves, with frequencies in the\nmHz range, have two major generation mechanisms; those\nexternal and internal to the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. Ex-\nternally generated waves are characterised by having small\nmagnitude effective azimuthal wave numbers, m (i.e. they\nhave a large scale size in the azimuthal direction) and az-\nimuthally polarised magnetic field oscillations. These are\nthe result of mechanisms such as magnetopause Kelvin-\nHelmholtz instabilities, impulsive solar wind pressure in-\ncreases or solar wind buffeting. Conversely, internally gen-\nerated waves are characterised by their small azimuthal scale\nsize and high m values and have radially polarised magnetic\nfield oscillations. It is now widely accepted that these ULF\nwaves are generated by wave-particle interactions between\nunstable ion distribution functions in the ring current and\nstanding wave modes along closed geomagnetic field lines.\nThe drift and bounce motions of energetic particles, which\nconstitute part of the global ring current, may lead to small\nfluctuations in the electric and magnetic fields in the magne-\ntosphere and ionosphere if there is excess energy available\nto the wave. It has been suggested (e.g. Southwood, 1976;\nHughes et al., 1978) that there is free energy available to be\nfed into waves when westward drifting ions have ion distri-\nbution functions (IDFs) containing a positive gradient region,\ni.e.:\ndf\ndW\n= \u2202f\n\u2202W\n+ dL\ndW\n\u00b7 \u2202f\n\u2202L\n> 0 (1)\nwhere f is the ion distribution function, W is the ion energy\nand L is the L-shell. This condition will be satisfied when\nthere is a positive gradient in \u2202f \/\u2202W, or a negative gradient in\n\u2202f \/\u2202L for westward propagating (m<0) waves (Southwood,\n1976), or both. Here we are concerned with single-spacecraft\ndata and only have measurements of \u2202f \/\u2202W . These non-\nMaxwellian (also known as \u201cbump-on-tail\u201d) IDFs are com-\nmonly created by natural processes of the magnetosphere\nPublished by Copernicus GmbH on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3028 M. E. Wilson et al.: A Statistical investigation of the invariant latitude dependence\nsuch as particle injections associated with substorm activ-\nity. Subsequent to such an injection the ions are subject to\ngradient-curvature and E\u00d7B drifts and move westwards, ar-\nriving at a given magnetic local time at different universal\ntimes due to the energy dependence of magnetospheric drift\npaths. Even under steady state conditions particles follow\nenergy-dependent drift paths which can lead to the formation\nof bump-on-tail distributions (Cowley and Ashour-Abdallah,\n1976; Ozeke and Mann, 2001); they may, at some point on\ntheir path, match the local resonance condition (Southwood\net al., 1969), given by\n\u03c9wave \u2212mwave\u03c9drift = N\u03c9bounce (2)\nwhere \u03c9wave, \u03c9drift, \u03c9bounce are the angular frequency of the\nwave, proton azimuthal drift and proton bounce respectively\nand N is an integer representative of the harmonic mode of\nthe wave. Particles satisfying this condition see a constant\nwave electric field and if their IDF has a bump-on-tail fea-\nture the free energy contained within it is fed to a resonant\nwave mode by a process of inverse Landau damping, caus-\ning wave growth. Southwood (1976) showed that the N=0,\n\u00b11 resonances should be the dominant modes in the magne-\ntosphere; the N=0 drift resonance requires a wave to have an\nodd-mode standing wave structure, while the N=\u00b11 drift-\nbounce resonances require an even-mode standing wave.\nWave-particle interactions have been implicated as a\nsource mechanism for a number of different categories of\nULF wave observations. These include ground based ob-\nservations of dusk sector storm time Pc5s (e.g. Allan et al.,\n1982, 1983) showing compressional waves of m \u223c\u20137 to \u2013\n80, and morning sector Giant Pulsation (Pg) observations on\nground magnetometer arrays (e.g. Chisham and Orr, 1991).\nMore recently radar observations have revealed a spectrum\nof such waves occur very commonly, ranging from storm\ntime-like high m Pc4 waves events in the afternoon and noon\nsectors (Yeoman and Wright, 2001), to Pg-like events in the\nmorning sector (Baddeley et al., 2002). Spacecraft obser-\nvations have also revealed significant particle-driven wave\npopulations, for example; Anderson (1993) and Anderson et\nal. (1990) found compressional Pc5 waves in the dusk sec-\ntor in AMPTE\/IRM data; Woch et al. (1990) found similar\nwave populations at geostationary orbit and Engebretson et\nal. (1992) investigated a number of radially polarised ULF\nwave events in the frequency range 5\u201315 mHz using data\nfrom AMPTE\/CCE, GOES 5 and GOES 6.\nMany different theories (e.g. Southwood et al., 1969;\nHasegawa, 1969), have addressed the problem of how par-\nticle energy is passed to a resonant wave mode, describing\nthe conditions required in the ambient plasma of the ring cur-\nrent in which the wave is embedded and the wave symmetry\nrequirements for wave growth. Although a variety of the-\nories exist, all have the common element that they identify\nthat the main energy source of high m (i.e. |m|>10) pulsa-\ntions as being magnetospheric ion populations. At present\nit is unclear as to which theory is correct in relation to the\ngeneration of westward propagating, poloidal mode, high m\nwaves. Originally remarked upon at the 1997 IAGA (Interna-\ntional Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy) meet-\ning (Takahashi, 1998) it was suggested that a study of \u201cthe\ndistribution function of energetic particles associated with\nwave events\u201d would be of import and benefit. Baddeley et\nal. (2004) completed a statistical study of magnetospheric\nparticle data gathered from the Polar satellite looking at the\noccurrence of \u201cbump-on-tail\u201d ion distributions in the mag-\nnetosphere at L-shell locations 6\u20139. Motivated by this, this\npaper presents an expansion of that work, employing simi-\nlar techniques, but using a significantly larger data set and\nextending the range of L-shells under investigation.\nKnowing the location of ion distributions with a \u201cbump-\non-tail\u201d feature in the magnetosphere, along with their prop-\nerties, will allow for limits to be placed upon the type of ULF\nwaves that can be expected to be observed in any particu-\nlar region by various ground based, and space borne, instru-\nments. Of chief importance are the particle energies involved\nin the resonant wave interactions. For a given wave, of fre-\nquency, \u03c9wave, and azimuthal wave number m, there are mul-\ntiple solutions, of the resonance equation (Eq. 2), pertaining\nto different wave modes. Such solutions show that for higher\nparticle energies a fundamental standing wave mode is more\nlikely in comparison to the lower energies expected in con-\njunction with a second harmonic mode structure.\nA multitude of instruments have been used to charac-\nterise the ULF waves that are thought to be generated by the\nprocess of inverse Landau damping and particle-wave reso-\nnance, primarily located between L-shells 6\u20139. Geostation-\nary spacecraft are in this latitude range and have been em-\nployed in studies of high m waves (e.g. Anderson, 1993;\nTakahashi et al., 1987). High (magnetic) latitude ground\nbased radar systems also cover the L-shells, such as SABRE\n(the Sweden And British auroral Radar Experiment; Nielsen\net al., 1983; e.g. Yeoman et al., 1992) and CUTLASS (Co-\noperative UK Twin Located Auroral Sounding System, Mi-\nlan et al., 1997; e.g. Baddeley et al., 2002). Ground based\ninstruments, at fixed latitudes in this range, for example\nthe DOPE HF system located near Troms\u00f8 (Doppler Pul-\nsation Experiment, Wright et al., 1997; e.g. Yeoman et al.,\n2000) and the Troms\u00f8 heater (e.g. Baddeley et al., 2002),\nwhich produces artificially-induced ionospheric irregulari-\nties to provide ionospheric targets for systems such as CUT-\nLASS have made observations of ULF waves at many MLTs.\nOn occasion, satellites in polar orbits (e.g. Polar) have been\nused in conjunction with such ground based instruments\n(e.g. Wright et al., 2001) to combine direct wave observa-\ntions with in situ magnetospheric particle data.\nThis paper will take a set of magnetospheric ion data and\nuse a statistical analysis to find the prevalence of \u201cbump-on-\ntail\u201d ion distributions at invariant latitudes in the 60\u25e6\u201380\u25e6\nrange over all MLT locations.

As a result this statis-\ntical analysis will provide a reference point for ULF wave\nobservations from ground magnetometers and all the North-\nern hemisphere SuperDARN radars, with their near global\ncoverage at the latitudes under investigation. Also, in addi-\ntion to the Troms\u00f8 heater experiments described by Badde-\nley et al. (2002), HAARP (High-frequency Active Auroral\nResearch Programme, Rodriguez et al., 1998) and SPEAR\n(Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar, Robinson et\nal., 2006), located at 63.1\u25e6 and 75.1\u25e6 magnetic latitude re-\nspectively, can be used to provide more sources of artificial\nbackscatter to observe such ULF wave activity.\n2 Instrumentation\nThe database created for the study is compiled from the om-\nnidirectional IDFs recorded using the Magnetospheric Ion\nComposition Sensor (MICS) of the Charge And Mass Mag-\nnetospheric Ion Composition Experiment (CAMMICE) par-\nticle detector on board the Polar satellite (Wilken et al.,\n1992). Launched on 24 February 1996 the satellite was\nplaced into a highly elliptical orbit with an apogee of 9 Earth\nradii (RE), perigee of 1.8 RE and an inclination of 86\u25e6. Such\nan orbit allowed for measurements of the Earth\u2019s polar re-\ngions at both high- and low-altitudes in a single 18 h orbit.\nThe satellite has good coverage of all MLTs over a period\nof 6 months, allowing for excellent, and even, data cover-\nage over an extended period of time. Figure 1 illustrates\nevery 30th Polar orbit between 16 May 1996 and 16 May\n2002. Figure 1a shows the X-Y Geocentric Solar Magnetic\n(GSM) plane, and illustrates the spacecraft\u2019s magnetic local\ntime coverage over the six year period from which data were\nanalysed. The satellite\u2019s apogee was initially over the north-\nern polar region and has precessed by approximately 18\u25e6 per\nyear since orbit insertion, leading to an evolution in the al-\ntitudes at which both polar regions are being studied. Fig-\nure 1b shows the GSM X-Z plane and illustrates the extent\nof the orbit precession, with apogee reaching the magnetic\nequator by May 2002. The satellite\u2019s orbit is fixed relative\nto the sun. In spring it traverses south to north in the day-\ntime magnetosphere and vice-versa in autumn, this can be\nseen in Fig. 1b where the apogee of the orbit is located in\nthe negative or positive X co-ordinate for spring and autumn\nrespectively. The satellite has a 6 s period with the spin axis\northogonal to the plane of the orbit, and allows CAMMICE\n(MICS) to map out the complete 4pi steradian distribution\nfunction. The instrument measures particle energies over a\nlarge range, 1 keV to 328 keV (reduced from 448 keV due\nto an instrument fault), utilising energy bins that are spaced\nlogarithmically. The instrument has a potential mass range of\n1 Amu to 55 Amu, allowing it to measure not only the pro-\ntons that are dominant in the magnetosphere, but also heavier\nFigure 1\n(a) (b)\nFig. 1.

The full characterisation of in-\ncident particles is achieved by utilising a mixture of energy\nspectroscopy, time-of-flight analysis and electrostatic filter-\ning to measure particle energy, mass and charge respectively.\nIn addition, a narrow angle of acceptance allows for the de-\ntermination of particle pitch angles.\n3 Statistical database\nThe database comprises \u223c7700 IDFs from data recorded\nover a 6 year period between May 1996 and April 2002 when\nthe Polar satellite was located between 60\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 invariant\nlatitude. This region maps to the ionosphere over an area\nwhere many ground based instruments are in operation, such\nas EISCAT and the Troms\u00f8 high power radio frequency fa-\ncility, the IMAGE, CANOPUS and other magnetometer net-\nworks, and SuperDARN. The data were collected using the\nTotal H channel of the particle collectors, it was thus as-\nsumed that IDFs are dominated by protons to such an ex-\ntent that contributions from other, heavier, ions were negli-\ngible. Firstly time intervals were extracted from the orbital\ndata when Polar\u2019s ionospheric footprint, mapped using the\nTsyganenko (1989) model into the northern hemisphere, was\nlocated at individual invariant latitudes, xo, where each de-\ngree of invariant latitude is defined as (xo-0.5\u25e6)\u2013(xo+0.5\u25e6).\nAveraging the proton flux for each of the proton energies, as\ndetermined by CAMMICE (MICS) energy bins, over time\nfrom each single passage through a particular invariant lati-\ntude range created a data set of \u201cinvariant latitude averaged\u201d\nIDFs. The data were then further binned according to hourly\nMLT; Fig. 2 presents the MLT coverage for a selection of\ninvariant latitudes, and an excellent distribution is seen uni-\nformly across all MLT bins (red bars).\nTo ensure that the rebinned, averaged IDF data had a suffi-\nciently high count rate to allow a reliable average to be found,\na limit on the minimum number of CAMMICE (MICS) time\nbins covered by the spacecraft over any particular invariant\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3027\/2006\/ Ann.

The coverage was set to at least 5 bins,\nequivalent to\u223c16 min, consistent with the study of Baddeley\net al. (2004). This constraint reduced the viable data included\nin the database by \u223c 65% and is displayed for the sample in-\nvariant latitudes in Fig. 2 by the green bars. Polar\u2019s orbital\norientation during its lifetime has resulted in the spacecraft\ntraversing lower invariant latitudes with greater speed. A\nfixed range of invariant latitude also maps to a smaller vol-\nume in the magnetosphere at lower invariant latitudes. Both\nof these situations result in the spacecraft spending a shorter\ntime in each individual invariant latitude bin for the lower\nlatitudes, reducing the data set, as seen in Fig. 2a. Further-\nmore, particle distributions characteristic of open field lines\nwere excluded from this study. This further reduction of vi-\nable data primarily removed data at the highest invariant lati-\ntudes, where open field lines are most common, and resulted\nin several invariant latitude bins being combined so that each\nMLT bin held enough invariant latitude averaged IDFs for\nreliable statistical calculations. Figure 3 illustrates the avail-\nable data after both constraints discussed above have been\napplied and the invariant latitude bins have been combined\nwhere required. MLT bins highlighted in green have \u226550\nviable invariant latitude-averaged IDFs, enough for reliable\nstatistical analysis; MLT bins in grey have <50 viable IDFs\nand so undergo no further analysis.\nThe final set of IDFs obtained was scanned for positive\ngradient regions. This required that there were 2 or more\nconsecutive increases in particle flux with respect to increas-\ning proton energies as defined by the 32 CAMMICE (MICS)\nenergy bins. To prevent the identification of data spikes as\npositive gradient regions a criterion was set for the maximum\nmagnitude of the change in f (W) as <1000 f (W)min, where\nf (W) and f (W)min are the distribution function and the\nminimum value of the distribution function value for the pos-\nitive gradient region of a particular IDF. Each positive gradi-\nent region identified had two attributes related to it recorded,\nthe position of the positive gradient region in each distribu-\ntion function, called the energy location, and the free energy\ncontained in the region available to a wave. The energy loca-\ntions were calculated from\nWav = (Wmin +Wmax)\/2 (3)\nwhere Wav is the average proton energy location, Wmin is the\nminimum proton energy and Wmax is the maximum proton\nenergy in the positive gradient region. The free energy con-\ntained within each bump was calculated using the method\ndescribed in Baddeley et al. (2004) using\nEtotal = V \u22176i(\u2202ni \u2212 \u2202nmin)(Wi \u2212Wmin) (4)\nwhere Etotal is the amount of free energy available, V is the\nvolume of the dipole field flux tube the IDF is located in (here\na cross sectional area of 1\u25e6 in latitude and 5\u25e6 in longitude, is\nused, as employed in Baddeley et al.

Figure 4 illustrates a typical IDF with a\nbump feature; the key values are labelled, and in this case a\ntotal free energy of 2.43\u00d71010 J was calculated from Eq. (4)\nabove as described in Baddeley et al. (2004). A number of\nIDFs recorded contain multiple positive gradient regions, in\nthese cases each region is considered separately as long as\nthey each meet the criteria specified above.\nIon distribution functions identified as containing positive\ngradient regions are indicated in Fig. 3 by the red bars. At the\nlowest latitudes, Fig. 3a, positive gradient regions are more\npopulous in the afternoon MLTs, whilst at higher latitudes\nthe occurrence of such regions form more symmetrical dis-\ntributions centred at \u223c12:00 MLT. As latitude increases, the\ntotal number of positive gradient regions for all MLTs de-\ncreases, but do so more rapidly the further from noon they\noccur. In panels a and b of Fig. 3, for MLTs 13:00 and\n14:00 respectively, the number of positive gradient regions\nidentified are actually greater than the total number of IDFs\nfor these particular MLTs (shown by the green bars as previ-\nously mentioned). This results from there being a significant\nnumber of IDFs containing more than one positive gradient\nregion.\n4 Statistical analysis\nInitially, when identifying positive gradient regions in the\nIDF data there was no limit set on the magnitude of the free\nenergy contained in the positive gradient regions in order to\nexamine the full range of free energies available. Figure 5\nshows the variation of the mean, median and the quartile\nranges of all free energies with respect to invariant latitude\nover the 60\u25e6\u201380\u25e6 range, averaging over all proton energies\nand MLT locations. A consequence of this approach is that\ndata can be represented for each individual 1 degree invariant\nlatitude bin as there are enough IDFs per invariant latitude for\na viable statistical analysis. The number of IDFs used in each\nbin is indicated by the red line, with the scale shown on the\nright hand side. Figure 5 shows that the free energy available\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3027\/2006\/ Ann. Geophys., 24, 3027\u20133040, 2006\n3032 M. E.

Over the 20\u25e6 range in invariant latitude the\namount of free energy drops by an order of magnitude, and\nthere is good agreement between the mean and median, indi-\ncating a small skewness in the distribution of energies. The\nquartiles, representing the spread of the middle 50% of all\ndata, decrease by a factor of \u223c5 as latitude increases, tak-\ning in to account that the energy scale is logarithmic. Finally\n>75% of the data have >109 J of free energy for all invari-\nant latitudes. This provides three natural free energy limits\nto work with; >1\u00d7109 J, >1\u00d71010 J and >1\u00d71011 J, repre-\nsenting the majority of the data, a typical reference level and\nan upper level to look at the few highest free energy positive\ngradient regions, respectively. These free energy thresholds\nare used in the analysis of the MLT variation of the proton\nenergy of the positive gradient regions discussed next.\nAs with the earlier study by Baddeley et al. (2004) the re-\nsults are displayed in a series of \u201cclock plots\u201d. Figures 6, 7\nand 8 show the percentage rates of occurrence for IDFs with\npositive gradient regions binned by proton energy and MLT,\ncompared to the total invariant latitude-averaged IDFs in any\nparticular MLT bin; where Fig. 6 includes all IDFs contain-\ning a free energy of >1\u00d7109 J; Fig. 7 >1\u00d71010 J and Fig. 8\n>1\u00d71011 J. In each clock plot the radial distance outwards is\nthe energy location for the protons in the positive gradient re-\ngion. The data has been binned according to the CAMMICE\n(MICS) energy bins. The MLT is indicated by the angular\nlocation, with midnight to the bottom, noon to the top, dawn\nto the right and dusk to the left. Figures 6, 7 and 8 contain\nsix panels, a\u2013f, each one representing data from a group of\ninvariant latitudes; the greyed out MLT bins in panels d\u2013f are\nequivalent to those greyed out in Fig. 3 and are the result of\nthere not being enough IDFs to provide a reliable analysis.\nThe colour scale is saturated at 24% in order to emphasise\nthe variations in occurrence at lower percentage values.\nAt the lowest invariant latitudes, Fig. 6a, the highest oc-\ncurrence rates, 32%\u201350%, are located between 13:00 MLT\nand 15:00 MLT reaching a peak at proton energies \u223c4 keV\nto \u223c8 keV. From 15:00 MLT through the dusk sector to\n21:00 MLT the focus is still in this proton energy range, al-\nthough occurrences have dropped to <\u223c30%. At higher pro-\nton energies from 12:00 MLT to 21:00 MLT there is a scatter-\ning of occurrences up to \u223c250 keV (here the maximum pro-\nton energy displayed is 100 keV for clarity of the major fea-\ntures) and below 5 keV. In the midnight sector, 21:00 MLT\nto 01:00 MLT, the entire range of proton energies are cov-\nered with low occurrence rates, it is relatively unlikely that\na wave particle interaction will be observed in this region\nwhen compared to the afternoon sector. For the whole morn-\ning sector, 01:00 MLT to 13:00 MLT, occurrence rates peak\nat >\u223c10% around \u223c7 keV with a slight occurrence rate in-\ncrease at 10:00 MLT. Similarly there is a second peak in the\nproton energy at \u223c20 keV to 30 keV in the morning sector,\nbut with slightly lower rates of occurrence. Over higher lati-\ntude ranges, see Figs. 6b\u2013c, this second, higher energy peak\nis not evident.\nOver the 68\u25e6\u201369\u25e6 invariant latitude range, Fig. 6b, positive\ngradients located at >10 keV are considerably less preva-\nlent, except in the morning sector, 04:00 to 12:00 MLT, here\nthey still occur out to \u223c40 keV with the highest rate of oc-\ncurrence at 7 keV. This signifies a general shift in the over-\nall occurrence rate towards the dawn sector over the opera-\ntional latitude of the Troms\u00f8 high power radar facility used\nin many ULF wave studies. Moving round to the location\n12:00 to 15:00 MLT, the high proton energy locations fall\naway, but there are still significant numbers, \u223c36% occur-\nrence, at \u223c5 keV as also seen in Fig. 6a.

As Fig. 6 except all panels show the percentage occurrence of IDFs with positive gradient regions containing >1011 J of free energy.\nthese invariant latitudes is now sparsely populated by IDFs\nwith positive gradients, as is the midnight sector, indicating\na reduction in the possibilities of wave generation over these\nMLTs. At higher invariant latitudes of 70\u25e6\u201371\u25e6, Fig. 6c there\nis further reduction in positive gradients at higher proton en-\nergy locations including those in the dawn sector. The main\nfocus of occurrences is still located at \u223c5 keV to \u223c10 keV\nbetween the hours of 08:00 MLT to 14:00 MLT.\nIncreasing invariant latitude even further, the results pre-\nsented in Figs. 6d, e and f show a trend of reduced occurrence\nrates at high proton energies with the focus remaining on the\nmorning sector close to noon. The greyed out MLT bins in\nthe midnight sector are the result of there being <50 original\nIDFs that could possibly contain positive gradient regions.\nIt should be noted that at these higher invariant latitudes the\nopen-closed magnetic field line boundary (OCFLB) has an\neffect on the results. Open field lines can not support IDFs\nwith positive gradient regions as they can no longer trap par-\nticles in the magnetosphere. The OCFLB is located such that\nin the midnight sector it is at lower invariant latitudes than it\nis in the midday sector, and this will be discussed later in this\nsection.\nFigure 6 employs a lower limit of 1\u00d7109 J as an energy\nthreshold for identifying positive gradient regions. Only\n\u223c10% of all identified IDFs with positive gradient regions\nhave a free energy of less than this, so Fig. 6 is a good repre-\nsentation of all the observed positive gradient regions. Fig-\nures 7 and 8 present the data in the same format, but with a\nprogressively higher energy threshold and thus present data\nwith high enough free energies to drive ULF waves with sig-\nnificant amplitudes (Baddeley et al., 2004). Comparing the\npanels in Fig. 7 directly to the corresponding ones in Fig. 6\nthere is only an \u223c5% difference in the positive gradient oc-\ncurrence rate for all MLTs; most IDFs have >1010 J avail-\nable. Figure 8, however, indicates that few extend to ener-\ngies as high as 1011 J, with an \u223c90% difference when com-\npared to Fig. 7. The largest calculated free energy value is\n7.1\u00d71012 J. Of all the data recorded \u223c75% of positive gradi-\nent regions contain between 1010 J and 1011 J of free energy.\nUnder all three energy thresholds the prevalence of the posi-\ntive gradient region is on the day side, although it is less clear\nin Fig. 8a where there is an almost even distribution over all\nMLTs, but at low occurrence rates. Furthermore, the low\nproton energy peak, seen in panel a of Figs. 6 and 7, in the\nmorning sector is not present in Fig. 8a, whilst the high pro-\nton energy peak remains in evidence. This indicates that the\nhigher proton energy positive gradient regions are those that\ncontain the largest amounts of free energy for the morning\nsector.\nFigures 7 and 8 show a greater loss of positive gradient re-\ngion occurrences in nightside MLTs compared to those closer\nto noon as invariant latitude increases.

Wilson et al.: A Statistical investigation of the invariant latitude dependence 3035\nlatitude of Polar\u2019s footprint where this occurred has been\nbinned by MLT. The result is that closed field lines are of-\nten available at invariant latitudes up to almost 80\u25e6 at noon,\nbut are rarely present at this latitude for 20:00 through to\n04:00 MLT, explaining the lower high-latitude occurrence\nrates of IDFs at nightside MLTs depicted in Figs. 6\u20138.\nAt lower invariant latitudes, waves generated by wave-\nparticle interactions might be expected to grow to larger am-\nplitudes, and consequently dissipate more energy into the\nionosphere, than those at higher invariant latitudes as the IDF\npositive gradient regions contain larger free energies there.\nHowever, in instances of higher amounts of available energy,\nthe drift-bounce resonance condition (Eq. 2) is also required\nto be satisfied for wave growth to occur, and this depends\ncritically on the energy location of the positive gradient re-\ngion.\nFigure 10 presents the variation of the mean, median and\nmode of the proton energy, Wav , location as a function of\ninvariant latitude. The number of IDFs used in each bin is in-\ndicated by the red line, with the scale shown on the right hand\nside. The mode is fairly constant at\u223c4 keV over the entire in-\nvariant latitude range, so the most common proton energy at\nwhich positive gradient regions occur is largely independent\nof invariant latitude. Over the middle latitudes of the range,\nthe median and mean are close to the mode, and the quartiles\nindicate that the distributions are narrow and evenly spread.\nAt the lower invariant latitudes the median departs towards\nhigher proton energies than the mode, as does the mean, but\nmore dramatically. To maintain the detail in the separation\nof the averages in Fig. 10 the proton energy scale has an up-\nper limit of only 25 keV. This does, however, lead to the up-\nper quartile values for 60\u25e6, 61\u25e6 and 80\u25e6 being absent from\nthe plot. The separation of the mean, median and mode is\ndue to the double peak seen in the proton energy occurrence\nthat is observed in the morning sector at the lower invariant\nlatitudes. This is further highlighted by the greater quartile\nranges. The mode of the data reveals that low proton en-\nergy positive gradient regions dominate in number, however,\nthe high proton energy peak (\u223c20 keV\u201330 keV) is significant\nwithin the population at low latitudes. At least 25% of the\ndata, as illustrated by the quartile ranges, are above 20 keV\nfor the lowest invariant latitudes. In contrast, for latitudes\n66\u25e6\u201376\u25e6, where the higher energy peak in occurrence rate is\nnot evident, see Fig. 8, 75% of the data is below \u223c6 keV. At\nthe extreme upper and lower ends of the latitude scale there\nis further separation of the mean, median and mode. In this\ninstance, however, it is likely due to the low number of IDFs\npresent, leading to spurious results.\nFigure 11 illustrates the mean, median and mode proton\nenergy location as a function of MLT.

(2004) conducted a similar study\nto that presented here. Using data collected over 2.5 years\nfrom both CAMMICE (MICS) and TIMAS instruments on\nPolar, unstable ion populations between, and including, in-\nvariant latitudes 67\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 were analysed. They concluded\nthat lower energy (10\u201345 keV) protons are the dominant un-\nstable, non-Maxwellian populations over that invariant lati-\ntude range with free energies of typically >1010 J. The free\nenergy associated with higher energy protons (>100 keV)\nwas found to be, in general, at least an order of magnitude\nless and typically <109 J. Furthermore, they concluded that\nthe majority of unstable IDFs occurred in the morning sector\nbetween 05:00 and 12:00 MLT thus making it a fertile ground\nfor high m ULF wave generation. They also concluded that\nPgs (see e.g. Chisham and Orr, 1991) are more likely to be\neven mode events driven by a drift-bounce resonance inter-\naction (N=1 in Eq. 2).\nParticle populations which display unstable, non-\nMaxwellian distribution functions, provide energy for\nhigh m ULF waves through the process of inverse Landau\ndamping. Here the analysis of ion populations in the\nmagnetospheric ring current is extended to explore the\nexpected latitudinal variation of the occurrence of such\nwaves. Using 6 years of particle data gathered from the\nCAMMICE (MICS) particle detector covering invariant\nlatitudes 60\u25e6\u201380\u25e6 the prevalence of ion populations has\nagain been scrutinised. Using this larger data set it has\nbeen possible to draw conclusions on the variation in the\noccurrence of IDFs with positive gradient regions with\nrespect to invariant latitude, MLT location and free energy.\nHowever, there still remains uncertainty in the possible role\nof spatial gradients in IDFs (the right-hand term in Eq. 1)\nsince Polar is only a single satellite; this does not, however,\ndetract from the conclusions of this paper.\nOverall the results presented here are in good agreement\nwith the previous study undertaken by Baddeley et al. (2004).\nFigures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show that the free energy available in un-\nstable IDFs is largely in the 109 J\u20131011 J range. This is con-\nsistent with previous observations of internally driven ULF\nwaves through inverse Landau damping. Allan and Poulter\n(1984) reported observations of two particle driven waves; a\nPc5 pulsation dissipating \u223c1010 J and a Giant Pulsation (Pg)\ndissipating \u223c1011 J into the ionosphere, both consistent with\nthe findings here. We will discuss implications for wave gen-\neration at various MLTs and invariant latitudes below.\n5.1 The variation of the MLT distribution with invariant lat-\nitude\nThe evolution in the MLT occurrence of bump-on-tail IDFs\nwith increasing invariant latitude can be seen in Figs. 6, 7\nand, to a lesser extent, 8 progressing from panel a to f in\neach case. The percentage occurrence of IDFs with positive\ngradient regions decreases, from highly populous to rather\nsparse as invariant latitude increases over the 20\u25e6 range un-\nder investigation. For the lowest invariant latitudes (\u226468\u25e6,\nsee panel a of Figs. 6, 7 and 8) the highest rates of occur-\nrence cover from 10:00 to 19:00 MLT, typically with pro-\ntons of energies\u223c<10 keV, while in the morning sector there\nis a twin peak in the occurrence rate at \u223c8 keV and \u223c20\u2013\n30 keV. Ground based observations of storm time Pc5s, ob-\nserved in the afternoon sector, have previously been under-\ntaken (e.g. Allan et al., 1982, 1983) and drift resonance be-\ntween odd mode standing structures and particles of ener-\ngies\u223c10\u201370 keV were considered to be the most likely cause\nof these events. The lowest values of this range are in near\nagreement with the findings of this study. Furthermore, sev-\neral spacecraft studies have also studied wave events in the\nafternoon sector of the magnetosphere at these invariant lat-\nitudes (e.g. Anderson, 1993; Anderson et al., 1990; Lessard\net al., 1999; Woch et al., 1990) and have drawn similar con-\nclusions on the energy of the driving particle populations.\nOzeke and Mann (2001) conducted modelling work on the\ndrift path trajectories of magnetospheric protons in a dipole\nfield; they found that the model accommodated solutions for\nboth storm time Pc5s, and radially polarised Pc4 pulsations\nin the afternoon sector. Applying an odd mode standing wave\nsolution (N=0) in Eq. (2) indicated favourable conditions\nover a range of L-shells for varying mnumbers, L\u223c6.5 for\nm=\u201330 and L\u223c5.1 for m=\u2013100. The locations in L space\nare comparable to the low invariant latitude (<65\u25e6) loca-\ntions of bump-on-tail occurrences in this study where the af-\nternoon sector is dominant over the morning sector. Their\nAnn. Geophys., 24, 3027\u20133040, 2006 www.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3027\/2006\/\nM. E. Wilson et al.: A Statistical investigation of the invariant latitude dependence 3037\nconclusions for Pc4 waves in the afternoon sector were, how-\never, more reserved; finding the L space location to be lim-\nited to L\u223c3.2, lower than the invariant latitudes covered in\nthis study.\nPrior statistical studies on high m ULF waves using satel-\nlite data, while agreeing with the conditions in which after-\nnoon sector wave events occur, yield dissimilar conclusions\nto this study and some ground based studies (e.g. Yeoman et\nal., 2000) as to the predominant MLT of the observed waves.\nThey imply that the dusk sector is the more prevalent region\nfor the generation of ULF waves. The present study, along\nwith Baddeley et al. (2004) and Yeoman et al. (2000) have\nan advantage over the earlier studies due to the substantial\ndatabases of measurements employed and together make a\nstrong case for a higher occurrence rate to be likely in the\nmorning sector at higher invariant latitudes (see below).\nAs invariant latitude increases the predominant region of\nbump-on-tail IDFs is found to move to the noon sector, as\nshown in panels b through d in Figs. 6 and 7. This is in\nkeeping with the findings of Baddeley et al. (2004) for the\ninvariant latitudes of 67\u25e6\u201370\u25e6. With this shift it is expected\nthat wave generation in the morning sector becomes increas-\ningly likely with higher invariant latitudes up to \u223c70\u25e6. At\nhigher latitudes it is increasingly likely that the OCFLB will\nbe reached, and so trapped particle populations are less likely\nto be available to allow wave particle interactions of the type\nof interest to this paper except close to noon MLT. This is\ndemonstrated in panels e and f for Figs. 6, 7 and 8, as the\noccurrence rate drops off rapidly at the higher invariant lati-\ntudes starting at first in the midnight sector and progressing\nthrough dawn and dusk towards noon. Further agreement is\nfound with the work by Yeoman et al. (2000) which found\na strong pre-noon dominance of high mULF wave activity\nutilising a HF Doppler sounder (DOPE). They found a to-\ntal of 41 out of 52 events were observed in morning sector\nMLTs that were uncorrelated with magnetometer observa-\ntions, with most waves observed between 06:00\u201310:00 MLT,\nin keeping with this study. Chisham and Orr (1991) also pre-\nviously reported, in a study of 34 Pgs, that occurrence was in\nthe morning sector between 02:00 and 09:00 MLT, peaking\nat 03:00\u201306:00 MLT. The authors found that the events were\nlimited to L-shells 5.75\u20137.75, corresponding to the middle\nof the invariant latitude range of this study (66\u25e6\u201368\u25e6). These\nobservations are in keeping with this study under the assump-\ntion that Pgs need >1011 J of energy, supplied by protons\nof \u223c20\u201330 keV, which are seen throughout the morning sec-\ntor at the lower latitudes, see Fig. 8a. This supports further\nthe modelling work by Ozeke and Mann (2001). Pgs in the\nmorning sector were concluded to be the result of a resonance\ninteraction during a quiet time magnetosphere by Chisham\n(1996); allowing the particle populations to drift westwards\nround to the morning sector as theE\u00d7B drift is small enough\nto leave them trapped. Using these favourable conditions\nOzeke and Mann (2001) calculated the drift path trajectories\nof magnetospheric protons in a dipole magnetic field in the\nmorning sector. This revealed favourable locations in parti-\ncle energy and L-shell space (W -L space) for high m wave\ngrowth to occur. In contrast to the afternoon sector results\ndiscussed above, their model implied the existence of highly\nmonochromatic Pc4 waves that were localised to latitudes in\nthe auroral zone (L=6\u201310) as a result of drift-bounce res-\nonance interactions between an even mode standing mode\nwave and \u223c10 keV protons. This information is in agree-\nment with this study, where above 70\u25e6 invariant latitude the\nnumber of bump-on-tail features in the ion distributions falls\noff rapidly.\nThompson et al. (2001) linked observations of a Pg to\nan odd mode wave driven by a proton population at 100\u2013\n150 keV. Using proton fluxes from the geosynchronous Los\nAlamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellite they noted a\nfluctuation in the 125\u2013153 keV channel with a frequency\nmatching that of their observed odd mode Pg wave. How-\never, this is not in itself evidence that protons of these en-\nergies were driving the wave and is not in agreement with\nthe work presented here. While it may be that a wave in the\nmagnetic field was being modulated by this fluctuation of the\nproton flux other options cannot be ruled out without mea-\nsurements of the particle distribution function. Baumjohann\net al. (1987) observed a similar proton flux fluctuation in the\nAMPTE\/IRM satellite whilst investigating a Pc5 wave event,\nand noted a positive gradient region located between ener-\ngies of \u223c1\u201330 keV. The ultimate conclusion was the possi-\nbility that the odd mode compressional pulsation was driven\nthrough a process of drift resonance such as a drift mirror\nmode (e.g. Pokhotelov et al., 1986). This study also finds the\nThompson et al. (2001) wave event to be unlikely to result\nfrom a population inversion at such high proton energies, as\nall bump-on-tail distribution functions located at such pro-\nton energies do not harbour sufficient free energy to pro-\nvide wave growth in Pgs (see Allan and Poulter, 1984). It\nis, therefore, suggested that, like Baumjohann et al. (1987),\nprotons of energies \u223c20\u201330 keV, as identified in this study,\nare responsible for the Pg wave event seen in Thompson et\nal. (2001) and led the modulation of proton fluxes observed\nat higher population energies. Thus the mode of the Thomp-\nson et al. (2001) event may have been misidentified, or al-\nternatively it may have arisen from spatial gradients in the\ndistribution function, as described in Eq. (1).\n5.2 Free energy variation with invariant latitude\nThe free energy in a positive gradient region of an IDF is also\nfound to vary with invariant latitude. As the observed invari-\nant latitude increases the free energy decreases by an order of\nmagnitude over the 20\u25e6 range. At higher invariant latitudes\n(\u226572\u25e6) the free energy has dropped significantly, but, at the\nsame time, the particle location becomes restricted almost\nexclusively to <40 keV. Pg wave generation at high invariant\nlatitudes is much less likely as their large amplitude requires\nlarger energies, \u223c1011 J, while Pc5 events require less free\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/24\/3027\/2006\/ Ann.

Wilson et al.: A Statistical investigation of the invariant latitude dependence\nenergy to be available to them, \u223c1010 J (Allan and Poulter,\n1984). This indicates Pc5 generation may continue to be seen\nfor a wide range of invariant latitudes up to \u223c73\u25e6 where oc-\ncurrence rates of the required ion distributions decrease.\n5.3 Proton energy variation with invariant latitude and\nMLT\nThe proton energy of positive gradient regions is affected by\nboth invariant latitude and MLT position (see Figs. 10 and\n11). As invariant latitude is increased positive gradient re-\ngions at >40 keV rapidly disappear (see panels a\u2013c of Figs. 6\nand 7 in particular), however, positive gradient regions at\n\u226410 keV are dominant more uniformly with invariant lati-\ntude in comparison to other proton energies, as revealed in\nFigs. 6, 7 and 10. Furthermore, the proton energy location\nis seen to vary with MLT to the extent that while the af-\nternoon MLTs lose all positive gradient regions in the IDFs\nfairly uniformly over the proton energy range >10 keV as in-\nvariant latitude increases, the morning sector does not. This\nleads to a larger spread in proton energies making it more\nlikely that the drift bounce resonance condition (Eq. 2) can\nbe satisfied. This is interesting, as it remains uncertain what\nthe proton energies of the bump-on-tail features in the driv-\ning particle populations are for morning sector ULF waves,\nin part due to there being no clear answer to the harmonic\nmode of Pgs. However, the higher energy ions proposed are\nuncommonly observed in this study, totalling only \u223c20% for\n>10 keV. These ions are observed most frequently in the cen-\ntre of the range of invariant latitudes observed here, imply-\ning that these L-shells are the most fertile locations for wave\ngrowth to occur.\nConjugate observations, of high m ULF waves in the\nmorning sector, and ion distribution function data reveal-\ning a positive gradient region are limited to one case study,\npresented in Baddeley et al. (2002), which showed an en-\nergy location of \u223c10 keV for the positive gradient region.\nThere is in addition, however, a study where ion data contain-\ning a bump-on-tail feature, located at \u223c7\u201310 keV, was seen\n2 h prior to ionospheric and magnetometer observations of a\nULF wave (Wright et al., 2001). In both cases the particle lo-\ncation of the bump-on-tail feature is in the low energy range,\nin agreement with this study.\nEngebretson et al. (1992) investigated a number of radially\npolarised ULF wave events in the frequency range 5\u201315 mHz\nusing AMPTE\/CCE, GOES 5 and GOES 6. They concluded\nthat 21 observed pulsation events, seen on the day side and\nprimarily in the dusk sector, were Pc4 events driven through\ninteractions with 100 keV protons. More recently Yeoman\nand Wright (2001) observed high m Pc4 waves in the af-\nternoon sector utilising the CUTLASS radars suggesting the\nwaves were driven by drift and drift-bounce resonance from\nparticle of energy 37\u201357 keV and 35\u201341 keV respectively.\nWhile the energies given by Yeoman and Wright (2001) are\nclearly available, through abundant likely ion populations at\nthe lowest invariant latitudes covered by this study in the af-\nternoon sector, only \u223c2% of observed IDFs contain >1010 J\nat the higher energy locations of \u223c 100 keV. Almost all such,\nrare, events are found between 18:00 and 21:00 MLT at the\nlowest invariant latitudes. Overall this would suggest that\nPc4 events from high energy particles are unlikely to be pro-\nduced due to positive gradients in the ion distribution func-\ntions, but could be related to spatial gradients at these ener-\ngies.\n6 Summary\nThis paper has presented a statistical study of magneto-\nspheric ring current proton populations using 6 years of IDF\ndata gathered using the CAMMICE (MICS) particle instru-\nment. The IDF database created was used to determine the\nstatistically most likely location of positive gradient regions\nin the ion distributions with respect to MLT, invariant lati-\ntude and the proton energy within the IDFs. Furthermore,\nusing the method set out in Baddeley et al. (2004), the free\nenergy contained in such distributions was calculated to as-\ncertain those that could provide enough energy to standing\nmode structures in the magnetosphere to generate observable\nhigh m ULF waves. This study has shown that the most\nlikely candidate unstable, non-Maxwellian populations are\nlow energy protons (<10 keV) located between 10:00 and\n19:00 MLT at invariant latitudes <68\u25e6. In contrast protons\nof energies \u223c7\u201340 keV dominate from invariant latitudes of\n\u223c66\u25e6 to 70\u25e6, with a focus at \u223c7 keV, at 05:00\u201312:00 MLT.\nThe dominant region in the morning sector is consistent with\nthe results of Baddeley et al. (2004), which looked at all data\ncontained between L-shell 6 and 9. Above 71\u25e6 the number\nof bump-on-tail features falls rapidly as the number of closed\nfield lines able to support trapped particles that make up the\nstudied IDFs become less commonly available. The invariant\nlatitude range of the ion populations dominant in the morn-\ning sector is conjugate to the HF Doppler sounder (DOPE)\nfacility located between 69\u25e6 and 70\u25e6 geographic latitude.\nThe bump-on-tail populations observed at these invariant lat-\nitudes are consistent with the work using DOPE by Yeoman\net al. (2000), in finding that the morning sector is a more fer-\ntile region for high m ULF wave generation than previously\nthought. Furthermore, this study would suggest that Pgs are\nlikely to be even mode as there are few candidate ion pop-\nulations that support enough free energy (>1010 J) to allow\nodd mode generation. In the afternoon sector, around dusk,\nthis study provides evidence to support the work of Allan et\nal. (1982, 1983); Yeoman and Wright (2001) and Baumjo-\nhann et al. (1987) in identifying storm time, compressional\nPc5 pulsations as fundamental, odd mode oscillations. These\nare driven by the ions of 30\u201360 keV at the lower invariant\nlatitudes studied here.\nWhile this paper has revealed some important relation-\nships in the particle populations of the magnetosphere there\nAnn.

Firstly, the\nlowest invariant latitudes studied in this paper (\u226467\u25e6) are\nclearly an extremely abundant area for data, but due to the or-\nbital constraints of Polar and\/or the time resolution of CAM-\nMICE (MICS) much of the possible information was re-\nmoved to maintain the statistical integrity of the study. Hav-\ning a spacecraft that could remain on the magnetic field lines\nlinked to these invariant latitudes for a longer period of time,\nor gather larger quantities of data in a short time, would allow\na more detailed look at these lower invariant latitudes. This\nwould be of benefit also in that many of the other studies\nlooking at particles or wave event occurrence have been fo-\ncussed solely below 70\u25e6. Secondly, while Polar has provided\na wealth of information over its many years of life, it can not\ntell us many things in relation to the spatial gradient present\nin the IDFs. For this a multi-spacecraft mission would be\nmore suited such as the Cluster mission as flies currently.\nAcknowledgements. The Authors would like to thank T.
