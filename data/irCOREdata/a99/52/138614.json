There is,\nhowever, little published work to help novice researchers develop this aspect of their craft. In\norder to address this issue we present a framework of citation usage derived from inductive\nanalysis of a selection of published papers, and emphasize its relevance for research methods\ntopics. This framework provides a template for structuring citation usage in academic research\nand a useful developmental tool for novice researchers.\n3Few would argue that one of the essential components in the repertoire of a scholar in\nthe field of management and organization is the ability to draw upon literatures from diverse\nsocial-scientific sources to underpin methodological choices and to construct theoretically-\nbased arguments that are clear, logical and internally consistent. Evidence of concern for\nrigour in relation to the acknowledgement and critical appraisal of prior published work is\nwidespread. For example, most research teaching programmes and texts allocate substantial\nspace to the provision of advice on finding and using literature. Books on writing for\nacademic publication (for example Huff, 1999) and, more specifically, on working with\nliterature (for example, Hart, 1998) offer much hard-won advice on this essential aspect of the\nwork of a scholar. Further, some seasoned editors of leading journals have taken the trouble to\nexplain the close relationship between good theorizing and success in publication (for\nexample Daft, 1985; Stewart, 2002; Whetten, 1989).\nBecause literature is used in different ways for different purposes, there can be no\nsingle approach or format for what is often vaguely called a \u2018literature review\u2019. As teachers of\nresearch students we are aware that effective and appropriate use of literature can be one of\nthe most difficult aspects of scholarship to develop. Our experience shows that some\nnewcomers to academia form an impression that academic writers strive to achieve an\nimpression of scholarship by being as wordy and obscure as possible. Yet novice researchers\nmust learn that in good quality academic writing the reverse is true, since only by using the\nclearest and most direct language can authors succeed in putting across to an international\naudience a complex argument. In addition to complexity of argument, a further layer of\ncomplication unique to the academic style comes from the need to make clear and appropriate\nlinks to existing literature. Such links provide a variety of information to other scholars,\n4including establishing precisely and specifically the writer\u2019s position in relation to that of\nother authors in their field. Those who seek to enter an academic discourse must immerse\nthemselves in journals, books and databases to identify research gaps, pin down theoretical\nframeworks and justify the selection of research methodologies and variables. Through the\nstudy of exemplary writing they are able to develop an understanding of the relationship\nbetween the purpose of a particular research paper and the structural characteristics embodied\nin its paragraphs, sentences and citations. They gain knowledge of the variety of ways in\nwhich references contribute to arguments, thereby learning to use literature to construct their\nown arguments. For those who already possess the tacit and experiential knowledge of\nscholarly citation it is easy to forget just how difficult that knowledge is to acquire.\nIn this paper we take the individual citation as the unit of analysis to describe citation\nusage in a variety of empirical and theoretical papers published in high quality journals in the\norganizational sciences. Our primary aim has been to produce a framework of citation usage\nthat sets out as clearly as possible the variety of reasons why authors cite the work of others,\nand how citation usage shifts as the structure of a particular article unfolds. Our intention is\nthat this framework may be used by doctoral students and other novice researchers to help\nthem understand how experienced writers craft their work, and to help them learn how to\ntransfer qualities of scholarly writing into their own work. Because of the focus of\nOrganizational Research Methods we place special emphasis on those aspects of our research\nand its findings related to citations involving research methods issues.\nIn the following sections we provide an overview of literature on writing academic\npapers, and describe the analytical process of our study. We present in table form four aspects\nof our results: (1) the framework, consisting of a classification of 25 citation purposes\n5arranged over the three main components of typical empirical papers (theoretical background;\nresearch methods; results and discussion); (2) examples of each of the eight citation purposes\nthat relate to research methods; (3) an analysis of the citations relating to research methods\nissues in each of the papers in our study sample; (4) the key structural elements of one of the\npapers revealed by the citation analysis. We discuss the implications of our findings for\nresearchers and offer a guide to using the approach with classes of students.\nUsing Citations\nThe literature on the writing of academic papers and the use of citations falls into three\nbroad groups. The first is concerned with the challenge of creating literature reviews and\nsynthesising prior research (for example Baker, 2000). The interest of the second group is in\nthe production of high quality academic papers (for example Bem, 2002). The third\nundertakes critiques of a particular work (for example Kilduff 1993).\nIn the main, references to citation usage are concerned with writing etiquette relating\nto format and the use of parentheses (Bem 2002; Carter 1987). However in some of these\naccounts we can discern three practices involving the use of citations in academic writing.\nThe first practice is that citations are used as a form of shorthand or code which allows the\nauthor to connect their paper with existing studies (Carter, 1987). This raises the question of\nwhether or not the citation is being used in a way which accurately reflects the content of the\ncited paper. As a reader we are required to trust the author in terms of whether or not work\ncited has been read and understood. Baker (2000) advises his readers to be careful about\nmaking such assumptions; invariably, in his view, the author has neither read nor understood\nthe cited work. He makes the point that to avoid compounding citation errors authors should\nonly cite texts which they themselves have read.\n6The second practice is that citations are used selectively or partially in a way that\nserves to strengthen the positioning of the paper in which they appear. This could be within\nthe overall framing of the work or in specific aspects of methodology. In his deconstruction of\nMarch and Simon\u2019s (1958) seminal text Organizations Kilduff (1993) suggests that prior\nresearch cited in the text was positioned in a way that was inconsistent with the characteristics\nof the original work, the purpose being to create the impression of a gap in the literature\nwithin which March and Simon could position their work. With regard to the selection of\nmethodological approaches Yin, Bingham & Heald (1976) note that citations concerning prior\nuses of methodology are made very specifically to compare methodological details, for\nexample the use of particular kinds of variables, whereas the overall research design may be\nvery different to that in the cited research. This can create a potentially misleading impression\nof similarity whereas in reality the two papers may have many fundamental differences.\nThe third practice is that citations are used only to support a clear explanation of the\nresearch approach or theoretical position; they are in no way substitutes for providing such\naccounts. In his review of 111 papers which were rejected from Academy of Management\nJournal or Administrative Science Quarterly, Daft (1985) notes that one of the problems\nregarding inadequate descriptions of theory and method was that authors would simply\nprovide a list of citations as justification, without a clear explanation as to why the particular\napproach was appropriate to the author\u2019s situation. In other words, although explanation is\noften improved by their use, citations in themselves are not sufficient.\nMethod\nBecause of the lack of existing frameworks derived from systematic research into\ncitation usage we chose to follow an inductive process, using \u2018data-driven generalization\u2019\n7(Langley, 1999: 708), to build a list of citation categories from scratch. This process worked\nas follows. Having selected the first published article for analysis, we examined sequentially\neach of its individual citations, applying the question, \u2018what is the author\u2019s purpose in using\nthis citation?\u2019 Each citation was assigned a descriptive category according to its purpose,\nconsisting of a leading verb followed by a subject. Each category was given a shorthand code\nindicating the leading verb, whether the citation related to theory (T), methods (M) or results\n(R), and a distinguishing number. Four examples of codes and categories are (1) AckT1:\nAcknowledge the source of an idea or concept; (2) AdvM3: Advocate variables or measures;\n(3) EstT4: Establish the absence or shortcomings of existing theory; (4) ClaR3: Claim that a\nstudy\u2019s results extend knowledge. Following the constant comparison method of analysis\ndescribed by Glaser and Strauss (1967) each citation was compared with others already\ncategorised. Following the inductive categorization logic common to this style of analysis\neach citation was either allocated to an existing category, with or without modification of that\ncategory, or assigned to a new category. Our aim was to produce a list of categories\nrepresenting the variety of citation purposes that would be parsimonious enough to be\ncomprehensible and memorable as a whole, and at the same time detailed enough to be useful\nas a guide to understanding how the combination of different types of citation usage underpin\nthe structure of a research paper.\nWorking as a team of two our approach was to choose an article, analyze it\nindividually, and then come together to discuss and agree the categorization of the purpose of\neach citation in the article and thus to develop the generalized list of codes and categories. We\nthen selected the next paper in the sequence. The process of development of the list of\ncategories was iterative, with some categories reconceptualized or divided or combined with\nother categories. As papers in the sequence gave rise to modifications to the list of categories\n8earlier analyses were revisited. We analyzed a total of six papers selected from a range of\nhigh-quality journals. The order in which we studied the articles, the logic applied to their\nselection, and the development of the 25 categories was as follows:\nPaper 1: Elsbach and Kramer (2003) is a qualitative study of how movie industry\ndecision-makers judged creative potential in others. The paper was chosen as our starting\npoint because it was a typical high-quality article that followed the classic structure of a\npublished field study of organizational phenomena: introduction, theoretical background,\nmethod, results, and discussion.\nAs an example of our analysis, consider the purpose of Elsbach and Kramer\u2019s citation\nof Kasof in the following sentence:\n\u2018A more recent and fruitful approach, therefore, has been to use social\njudgement theory and research to understand the process of creativity\nassessment (Kasof, 1995a).\u2019 (Elsbach and Kramer, 2003: 284)\nThe authors are drawing on the prior work of Kasof to support their advocacy of the\nuse of social judgement theory as a basis for studying creativity assessment. We categorized\nthis citation \u2018Advocate a theory or theoretical concept (AdvT1)\u2019.\nThis paper\u2019s citations represent 12 of the 25 categories in the final version of the list of\ncategories (Table 1).\nPaper 2: Green, Welsh & Dehler (2003) was selected for being a quantitative study published\nin the same journal as Paper 1. Final analysis of Paper 2 resulted in the addition of six new\ncategories to Table 1 (AckM1, AdvM2, EstT1, EstR1, InfM1, and ExpR1). Some of these\n9new categories arose from the quantitative nature of the study. Others were revealed as\ncitations were used in different ways to support the authors\u2019 arguments.\nPaper 3: Danneels (2002) is published in Strategic Management Journal, a different American\njournal. This paper added four new categories to Table 1 (AckT1, AdvM4, DefT1 and IllT1).\nPaper 4: Townley, Cooper & Oakes (2003) is published in a European journal. Two new\ncategories (EstT3 and ExpT1) were added.\nPaper 5: Wang & von Tunzelmann (2000) is a conceptual paper rather than the report of a\nfield study. No new categories were added.\nPaper 6: As a check for the soundness of our analysis we analysed Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu &\nKochhar (2001), a different quantitative study from Academy of Management Journal. One\nnew category (AdvM3)was added.\nResults\nThe final list of codes and categories is shown in Table 1. The rows relate to the verbs\nthat describe the authors\u2019 purpose (advocate, define, illustrate, and so forth). The columns\nrepresent three distinct components of a typical theoretically-informed empirical study:\ntheoretical background, method, results and discussion.\n------------------------------\nInsert Table 1 about here\n------------------------------\n10\nIn Table 2 we illustrate our categorization with examples of each category that relates\nto citations involving research methods issues. A full list of examples relating to all\ncategories is available on request.\n------------------------------\nInsert Table 2 about here\n------------------------------\nTo enable the reader to see in detail our approach, and to examine the structure of the\nresearch methods sections of the sources that informed our generalized results, we include in\nTable 3 the analysis of research methods citations from each of the six papers..\n------------------------------\nInsert Table 3 about here\n------------------------------\nWe have described our analysis of six published studies, and presented our results as a\nframework of categories that shows the range of purposes for which citations are used in\nscholarly publication. In developing the framework we have, of course, encountered the kinds\nof categorization difficulties commonly faced by qualitative researchers. Even with such a\nclear and unambiguous unit of analysis as the citation two types of problem had to be\novercome. The first type of problem arose from the multilayered and contextual nature of\ncitation purpose. Take the following example:\nSentence 1: \u2018Following this logic, we chose the qualitative approach of\n\u201ctheory elaboration\u201d (Lee, Mitchell, & Sablynski, 1999). (Elsbach and\nKramer, 2003: 285-6)\n11\nThe citation by Elsbach and Kramer of Lee et al. is an acknowledgement of the source of a\nresearch approach (AckM1). However, as the next sentence in the paper reveals, the approach\nis first acknowledged in order to advocate it as particularly suited to the kind of study that is\nthe subject of Elsbach and Kramer\u2019s paper.\nSentence 2: \u2018According to Lee and his colleagues, theory elaboration results\nin extensions to theory in cases where \u201cpreexisting conceptual ideas or a\npreliminary model [notions about the use of prototypes in creativity\njudgements, for example], drives the study\u2019s design\u201d (1999:164).\u2019 (Elsbach\nand Kramer, 2003: 285-6)\nThe rule of thumb we applied to such classification choices was to follow this logic: if\na citation in category A (in this case acknowledge the source of a research approach) is\nserving the purpose of category B (in this case advocate a research approach) use category A\nrather than B.\nThe second type of problem we faced was dealing with citations that could in\nthemselves be regarded as ambiguous. Take, for example, the following sentence:\n\u2018Because we had both cross-sectional (firms) and time series (years) data,\nwe used a panel data methodology, using the least squares dummy variable\n(LSDV) model (Hsiao, 1986; Sayrs, 1989).\u2019 (Hitt et al., 2001)\nBoth citations (Hsiao, 1986 and Sayrs, 1989) refer to methods textbooks. We chose to code\nthem both AckM1: Acknowledge the source of a research approach or instrument. But do\n12\nthey both provide support for the whole argument presented in the sentence, that a panel data\nmethodology using LSDV is to be used with data that is both cross sectional and time series\n(AdvM1: Advocate a research procedure or process)? Or do they, as we interpreted, explain\nhow to apply an LSDV model (AckM1: Acknowledge the source of a research approach or\ninstrument)? Or do they each do one or more of these things?\nTo take another example, Townley, Cooper and Oakes\u2019s (2003) study draws on data\nfrom primary and secondary sources. We coded citations of secondary sources EstM1:\nEstablish published material used as data. Yet at times it is less than clear whether a cited\nsecondary source is offered as evidence of a phenomenon (EstM1) or simply an\nacknowledgement of the source of a theoretical concept (AckT1). Consider the following\nthree examples from Townley, Cooper and Oakes, 2003:\nExample 1: In addition to pressures from the Auditor General\u2019s office, there\nwere also internal pressures for isomorphism between departments (DiMaggio\nand Powell 1983).\u2019\nExample 2: As part of their initiatives, the Albertan government was heavily\ninfluenced by reinventing government initiatives from other jurisdictions\n(Osborne and Gaebler 1993; Douglas, 1993).\nExample 3: \u2018Since 1979, the Auditor General\u2019s Annual Reports had regularly\nrecommended that the provisional government design and implement a system\nfor promoting effectiveness measurement (Gendron et al. 2001).\u2019\n13\nIn Example 1 it is, for several reasons, obvious that the citation of DiMaggio and Powell is\nnot included because those authors had said anything about isomorphism between\ndepartments in the Provincial Government of Alberta, but is simply an acknowledgement of\ntheir association with the concept of isomorphism. Similarly, a glance at the Osbourne and\nGaebler (1993) reference (the book Reinventing Government. New York: Plume) shows that\nthe citations in Example 2 are serving a similar purpose in relation to the concept of\ngovernment reinvention. With regard to Example 3, however, readers new to the literature\nmight not know whether the citation of Gendron et al. is establishing where the factual matter\nof the sentence came from (EstM1) or whether it is acknowledgement of the source of the\nconcept of effectiveness measurement (AckT1). Many readers would need to get hold of the\noriginal source to establish that it is, in fact, the former. We found many examples of\nopportunities for greater clarity over the exact purpose of a citation.\nDiscussion\nOur study is intended to help researchers \u2013 particularly research students \u2013 learn the\ncraft of scholarly writing. Following Daft, who argues that \u2018no one can learn to write an\nexcellent paper based on examples of failure.\u2019 (1985: 193), we have studied only published\npapers from highly regarded journals. In our teaching of doctoral students we have explored\ntwo different ways of applying the use of citation analysis. First, we asked a class of doctoral\nstudents to analyze without the help of the classification framework an article we had\nselected, and to come up with their own framework. Most students found this extremely\ndifficult, and some were initially unable to distinguish any differences of purpose between\ncitations. Despite the difficulty of the task, however, the students claimed that the exercise\nprovided a tantalizing glimpse of something beyond their immediate grasp, even though\nprogress in improving their understanding of citations was slow.\n14\nOur second approach was to ask a different class of doctoral students to analyze a\npaper using the classification framework as a guide. Following this approach students made\nfaster progress and claimed to have enlightened their appreciation of an aspect of scholarship\nthat had been, at best, murky. We have continued to develop this exercise with successive\ncohorts of students. The half-day session is now conducted as follows:\n1 Ask students to read a particular paper in preparation for the class session,\npaying particular attention to the use of theory and methods, and the claiming of theoretical\nand practical implications.\n2 In class, provide the framework (Table 1), a full list of examples, and a blank\ntemplate listing all the citations in the selected paper with space for writing in codes and\ndescriptions (such a template for the methods sections of the Hitt et al. paper is included as\nAppendix A. A complete template for the full paper is available on request).\n3 To familiarize the class with the approach, initiate a discussion of the purpose\nof three or four selected citations, using the framework as a guide.\n4 Allow the class to continue to work on the exercise in small groups.\n5 Hold a plenary discussion, allowing agreements and disagreement over\nclassifications to deepen their understanding of citation usage.\nThe students\u2019 learning from the above exercise is consolidated in a follow-up exercise\nin which they are asked to bring to the class an abstract of their own emerging research ideas\nin the form of a series of about five statements, each supported by one or two references\nwhere appropriate, leading up to a research question. Each student\u2019s abstract is discussed in\nturn, providing opportunities to develop their skills of both building an argument and offering\nconstructive criticism of arguments made by their peers. The students claim that the citation\nanalysis exercise gives them more confidence in using citations to support scholarly\n15\nargument, following the kind of steps laid down by the exemplary writer whose work they\nhad deconstructed.\nFor experienced authors those steps are probably already clear. As the Hitt et al.\n(2001) example shows, Hitt and his colleagues work their way through the established\nstructure of a quantitative Academy of Management Journal paper. In this example the\ncitation analysis reveals that the structure of the paper consists of six stages, summarized in\nTable 4. Table 4 also shows which citation categories are used in each of the six stages of the\npaper.\n------------------------------\nInsert Table 4 about here\n------------------------------\nThe sequence of stages outlined in Table 4 divides this paper into three key sections:\ntheoretical background (stages 1 & 2), method (stages 3 & 4) and results and discussion\n(stages 5 & 6). However, within each of these sections the usage of citations shifts between\nthe stages. In the case of theoretical background it moves from citations which establish and\ndefine the broad concepts of the study (stage 1) through to establishing more specific\nvariables and relationships used for empirical investigation (stage 2). In the presentation of\nthe methodology the paper moves from providing a case for the research context and\nsampling approach (stage 3) through to the selection of specific measures and their validation\n(stage 4). In the results and discussion section the usage of citations again moves from\nacknowledging how the results connect with existing studies (stage 5) to be followed by a\nspecific statement of how this particular study has moved our understanding from prior\nresearch (Stage 6). Much of the literature on writing suggests an \u2018hourglass\u2019 structure (Bem,\n16\n2002), starting broadly, focusing down to specific variables for the empirical study and then\nbroadening out with implications of the study at the end. The analysis of citation usage shown\nin Table 4 suggests a different kind of structure. In each of the three sections citation usage\nstarts broad and narrows down to increasingly specific issues such as the use of variables,\nanalysis tests and claims regarding the contribution of the research. Citation usage therefore\nshifts from the broad to the specific providing a structure which resembles three consecutive\nfunnels as opposed to the classic hourglass shape. Whilst these observations are drawn from\nthe analysis of one particular paper, they do suggest a generic and explicit map as to how\ncitations can be used to support the crafting of an empirical research paper.\nOur coding scheme provides structure and specific guidance on the many different\npurposes for which citations are used. The complexity and detail of the scheme is consistent\nwith the literature on academic writing regarding the selective and partial way in which\ncitations are used. However, the many different ways in which citations are used also suggests\nthat compounded citation errors (where a citation becomes corrupted following multiple uses)\nare likely to be caused by the characteristic that each author uses the citation in a highly\nselective and partial way, thereby creating a situation which is then misinterpreted by\nsubsequent authors. The best advice therefore must always be that if you are going to use a\ncitation make sure you read the paper first.\nIn conclusion we suggest that understanding citation usage and the structure of\nacademic papers is greatly enhanced by the systematic, detailed study of exemplary work. The\nbenefits of such analysis lie not only in attaining deep comprehension of the specific\npublished work studied, but also in developing the ability to deconstruct the paper into a\nseries of stages where citations are used to funnel the discussion into a specific theoretical\n17\nposition, research method, and contribution. The citation framework illustrated in Table 4 is\noffered not as a recipe, but as way of better understanding the ingredients and the possible\nways in which they may be combined in the development of academic writing.\n18\nReferences\n(Note: Refer to source papers for citations listed in Tables 2, Table 3 and Appendix A)\nBaker, M.

Rather than\nstarting from scratch and developing new theories, we should try to consolidate and develop what we have already produced.\u2019\n(Danneels, 2002: 1098)\nWe used a typical process for interpreting such effects, following Stewart and Barrick (2000).\n25\n(Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu and Kochhar, 2001: 21)\nAdvM1 Advocate a research approach or philosophy\nIn contrast, qualitative research designs are have been shown to be particularly well-suited to analyzing dynamic, interactive processes (Lee,\n1999).\n(Elsbach and Kramer, 2003: 285)\nRouse and Daellenbach (1999) called for a rich, detailed investigation of the nature of firm resources through comparative case studies.\n(Danneels, 2002: 1098)\nMethodologically, however, taking utterances seriously allows the researcher to grasp the reasons why these appear rational, that is that the\nsubject felt entitled to put them forward as true.\n\u2018We can descriptively ascertain what the actor takes to be true in contradistinction to what is (in our opinion) true. The choice ...\nconsists in either ignoring or taking seriously the truth claim that the actor connects with his opinions.... If we ignore them as\n26\nvalidity claims, we treat opinions and aims as something subjective.... In this case we neutralize the claims to truth.\u2019 (Habermas\n1984: 117).\n(Townley, Cooper and Oakes, 2003: 1049)\nAdvM2 Advocate a research procedure or process\nWhere multiple informants were used, we assessed agreement among informants\u2019 judgements about projects and the decision to aggregate data to\nthe project level by examining between-project variability (Hays, 1981) and interrater agreement (rwg; James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984, 1983).\n(Green, Welsh and Dehler, 2003: 425)\nAs the study progressed, I sorted these memos and grouped them to arrive at conceptual clusters (Berg, 1989).\n(Danneels, 2002: 1102)\nThe LSDV model also serves to minimize problems of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, both of which can be caused by unaccounted firm-\n27\nspecific heterogeneity (Sayrs, 1989).\n(Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu and Kochhar, 2001: 20)\nAdvM3 Advocate variables or measures\nDiversification measures that capture the number of businesses of a firm as well as the relative importance of each segment are superior to\nproduct count measures (Davis and Duhaime, 1992; Hoskisson, Hitt, Johnson and Moesel, 1993).\n(Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu and Kochhar, 2001: 18)\nAdvM4 Advocate a research context\nResearch sites were selected to achieve a diverse sample that provides many possibilities for comparison, which enables richer theory\ndevelopment (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1990).\n(Danneels, 2002: 1098)\nThis initiative was similar to experiences in other jurisdictions (Pollitt and Bouckaert 2000).\n28\n(Townley, Cooper and Oakes, 2003: 1049)\nTo do so, it is helpful to focus on a single industry (Dess, Ireland and Hitt, 1990).\n(Hitt, Bierman, Shimizu and Kochhar, 2001: 19)\nEstM1 Establish shortcomings of previous approaches\nFirst, prior research has not primarily involved professional decision makers, but laypersons, such as undergraduate students participating in a\nlaboratory experiment in exchange for course credits. For example, Katz & Giacommelli (1982) developed their framework of creativity\nperceptions by asking undergraduates to evaluate a picture of an artist in a studio and then sort adjectives into piles that described that picture.\n(Elsbach and Kramer, 2003: 285)\nAt this point much resource-based empirical research has used secondary data, and therefore was limited to the proxies of organizational\nresources present in such data (Silverman, 1999).\n(Danneels, 2002: 1096)\n29\nEstM2 Establish published material used as data\nWe also extensively searched for firsthand accounts of pitches in books written by experts on both screenwriting and producing (e.g., Bach,\n1985; Dunne, 1997; Linson, 1996; Long, 1997).\n(Elsbach and Kramer, 2003: 288)\nDebate had to be \u2018representative (with all interested and affected groups); open; transparent; and accountable\u2019 (Government of Alberta 1993: 10).\n(Townley, Cooper and Oakes, 2003: 1049)\nInfM1 Inform further sources of information (method)\n(For explanations of the survival analysis approach, see Allison [1984], Morita, Lee, and Mowday [1989], and Morita, Lee, & Mowday, [1993].)\n(Green, Welsh and Dehler, 2003: 426)\n30\nTABLE 3\nResearch Methods Citation Usage in Six Studied Papers\nCite\n#\nPage Cited author(s) Purpose of citation Usage\nPaper 1: Elsbach, K.
