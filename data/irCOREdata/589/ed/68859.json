Fal\u2019ko\nDepartment of Physics, Lancaster University, Lancaster, LA1 4YB, United Kingdom\nWe present a theoretical study of degeneracy breaking due to short-ranged impurities in finite,\nsingle-wall, metallic carbon nanotubes. The effective mass model is used to describe the slowly\nvarying spatial envelope wavefunctions of spinless electrons near the Fermi level at two inequivalent\nvalleys (K-points) in terms of the four component Dirac equation for massless fermions, with the role\nof spin assumed by pseudospin due to the relative amplitude of the wave function on the sublattice\natoms (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d). Using boundary conditions at the ends of the tube that neither break valley\ndegeneracy nor mix pseudospin eigenvectors, we use degenerate perturbation theory to show that\nthe presence of impurities has two effects. Firstly, the position of the impurity with respect to the\nspatial variation of the envelope standing waves results in a sinusoidal oscillation of energy level\nshift as a function of energy. Secondly, the position of the impurity within the hexagonal graphite\nunit cell produces a particular 4 \u00d7 4 matrix structure of the corresponding effective Hamiltonian.\nThe symmetry of this Hamiltonian with respect to pseudospin flip is related to degeneracy breaking\nand, for an armchair tube, the symmetry with respect to mirror reflection in the nanotube axis is\nrelated to pseudospin mixing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMuch of the interest in carbon nanotubes has been motivated by the desire to develop new nanoscale electrical\ndevices [1, 2]. The electronic properties of nanotubes follow from the band structure of a two-dimensional sheet of\ngraphite which is a semi-metal, having a vanishing energy gap at the six corners, K-points, of the hexagonal first\nBrillouin zone. A single-wall nanotube may be thought of as a graphene sheet rolled up to form a nanometre-diameter\ncylinder. Periodicity around the circumference results in quantized transverse wavevectors leading to metallic or\nsemiconducting behaviour depending on whether the K-point wavevector K is an allowed wavevector.\nA finite nanotube should possess discrete energy levels corresponding to standing waves typical of a confined\nquantum particle. Evidence of discrete levels was seen in transport measurements [3, 4] a few years ago, followed by\nthe direct observation of sinusoidal standing wave patterns by scanning tunneling microscopy [5, 6] with wavevectors\ncorresponding to those near the K-point K. More recently, Coulomb blockade measurements on carbon nanotube\nquantum dots [7, 8, 9] have seen varying degrees of evidence for the fourfold periodicity of shell filling that would be\nin agreement with expectations based on the spin and valley (K-point) structure.\nIn this paper, we will consider the interplay between two sources of valley degeneracy breaking in a finite nanotube,\nnamely isolated impurities and the boundaries themselves. The aim is to show how the character of an impurity\ndetermines the extent of valley degeneracy breaking, resulting in the possibility to observe either twofold or fourfold\nperiodicity of shell filling [9]. As far as boundaries are concerned, a number of authors [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] have\nmodelled finite-length nanotubes in order to describe the atomic scale variation of standing waves patterns and the\nopening of an energy gap displaying an oscillating dependence on the tube length. For impurities, theoretical studies\nof open nanotubes by Ando and co-workers [16, 17, 18] have shown that short-ranged potentials (typical range smaller\nthan the lattice constant of graphite) produce back-scattering, but not long-ranged potentials. For an armchair tube,\nit was demonstrated that impurities preserving mirror reflection in the nanotube axis do not mix the bonding pi and\nantibonding pi\u2217 energy bands [18, 19, 20]. For closed nanotubes, a recent density-functional calculation [21] has shown\nhow a small number of defects may reduce the four-fold periodicity of shell filling to two-fold.\nIn the scanning tunneling microscopy measurements of Ref. [6] an additional slow spatial modulation of the standing\nwaves was observed. It was interpreted as being a beating envelope function with wavevector q, |q| \u001c |K|, resulting\nfrom the interference of left and right moving waves with slightly different total wavevectors K \u00b1 q. The effective\n2mass model [22, 23, 24, 25] provides an analytical description of the electronic structure near the K point where the\ntotal wavevector is k = K + q and the dispersion relation is linear E = sv |q|, v is the Fermi velocity and s = \u00b11\nfor the conduction and valence band, respectively. For spinless electrons, the envelope wavefunction \u03a8 (q, r) has four\ncomponents corresponding to two inequivalent atomic sites in the hexagonal graphite lattice (\u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d) and to\ntwo inequivalent K-points in the hexagonal first Brillouin zone. The resulting eigenvalue equation for \u03a8 is the massless\nDirac equation written in the \u201cchiral\u201d or \u201cspinor\u201d representation,\n\u2212 iv\u03b1.\u2207\u03a8 = E\u03a8; \u03b1 =\n(\n\u03c3 0\n0 \u2212\u03c3\n)\n; (1)\n\u03c3 = ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 (\u03c3x \u0131\u02c6+ \u03c3y \uf6be\u02c6) e\n\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2,\nwhere the role of spin is assumed by the relative amplitudes on the A and B atomic sites (\u201cpseudospin\u201d): \u03c3 is a vector\nin the (x, y) plane rotated by the chiral angle \u03b7 of the tube. Also, v =\n(\u221a\n3\/2\n)\na\u03b3 is the Fermi velocity, a is the lattice\nconstant of graphite and \u03b3 is the nearest neighbour transfer integral.\nSince we are interested in perturbations of a clean nanotube that may destroy valley degeneracy, we must identify\nthe symmetry that preserves degeneracy. The pseudospin of a 2D graphite sheet does not transform in the same way\nas real spin because certain transformations result in a swapping of the orientation of A and B atoms. This leads us\nto identify an operator \u03c1z that flips pseudospin but commutes with the clean effective Hamiltonian, Eq. (1),\n\u03c1z =\n(\n0 i\u03c3z\ni\u03c3z 0\n)\n. (2)\nIn general, the two degenerate eigenvectors {\u03a81,\u03a82} corresponding to the two non-equivalent K-points of the Dirac\nequation for a clean, metallic nanotube may be labelled using the component of pseudospin along the tube axis \u03a3a or\nusing pseudo-helicity \u03bb. Therefore, the pseudospin-flip operator \u03c1z relates the degenerate eigenvectors to each other,\n\u03c1z\u03a81 \u2192 \u03a82. We may make two statements about the consequence of the symmetry of a particular perturbation \u03b4H .\nThe first is that perturbations that are symmetric in the pseudospin-flip operator \u03c1\u22121z \u03b4H\u03c1z = \u03b4H preserve pseudospin\nand do not break valley degeneracy. Secondly, a perturbation that breaks pseudospin-flip symmetry, \u03c1\u22121z \u03b4H\u03c1z 6= \u03b4H ,\nbut is still symmetric with respect to the operator \u03a3a measuring pseudospin \u03a3\n\u22121\na \u03b4H\u03a3a = \u03b4H , will break degeneracy\nwithout mixing the pseudospin eigenvectors. Since pseudospin is the relative amplitude of the wavefunction on the\nA and B atomic sites, a given perturbation must differentiate between adjacent atoms in order to break pseudospin\nsymmetry. In other words, the influence of the perturbation must vary spatially on the scale of the graphite lattice\nconstant a: such a perturbation is described as being short-ranged.\nWe will investigate how a perturbing short-range potential breaks the inter-valley degeneracy. The position of\na potential within the hexagonal graphite unit cell will produce a specific 4 \u00d7 4 matrix structure of the resulting\neffective Hamiltonian, and the symmetry of the matrix will determine the extent of degeneracy breaking. As the\nultimate limit of a short-range potential, we consider a delta function potential because it simplifies the calculations\nand the resulting analysis. We would like to stress that our intent is not to produce exact quantitative results that\ndescribe the influence of impurities, but to characterise possible symmetry breaking properties. The positions of the\npotential we consider are shown with relation to the hexagonal graphite unit cell in Fig. 1. They are near an A type\natomic site, labelled A in the figure, near a B type atomic site, labelled B, near the centre of the unit cell, labelled C,\nor near the half-way point between neighbouring atoms, labelled D.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In Section II, the effective mass model leading to the Dirac equation is briefly\ndescribed along with a discussion of its symmetry properties. Section III is an introduction to the boundary conditions\nof a closed carbon nanotube and the resulting energy spectrum of a clean nanotube is calculated. In Section IV, we use\ndegenerate perturbation theory to show how valley degeneracy is broken by a short-range potential and to examine\nthe relationship between the position of the potential and symmetry. In Appendix B we give a brief account of a\nnon-perturbative calculation of the energy spectrum for the example of an impurity exactly on an atomic site.\n3y\u2019\nx\u2019\ny\nx\n\u03c7 \u03b7\n\u03c7\u2212\u03b7\n\u03b4R\nA1\nB1\nC\nA2\nA3\nB3 B2\nD1\nD2\nD3D4\nD5\nD6\nFIG. 1: The positions with respect to the graphite unit cell of the perturbing potential are labelled as A, B, C, and D. Carbon\natomic positions are at the six corners of the hexagon, there are three A atomic positions {A1, A2, A3} and three B atomic\npositions {B1, B2, B3}. We also consider the potential to be near the centre of the unit cell (C) or at one of six positions\nhalf-way between neighbouring atoms (D1 to D6). An additional small deviation \u03b4R of the potential position is shown (greatly\nexaggerated) for the C position, with direction described by angle \u03c7 in the nanotube coordinates (x, y). The figure has chiral\nangle \u03b7 = pi\/6 corresponding to an armchair tube.\nII. SYMMETRY PROPERTIES OF THE EFFECTIVE MASS MODEL\nIn the effective mass model of two-dimensional graphite [22], the total wavefunction \u03a8tot is written as a linear\ncombination of four components m = {1, 2, 3, 4} corresponding to two K-points \u00b5 = {1, 2} and pi-type atomic orbitals\n\u03d5j(r\u2212Rj) on two non-equivalent atomic sites j = {A,B} in the unit cell,\n\u03a8tot (r) =\n4\u2211\nm=1\n{\n\u03a6(0)m (r)\u2212Gm (r) .\u2207+ . . .\n}\n\u03c8m (r) , (3)\nwhere\n\u03a6(0)m (r) =\n1\u221a\nN\nN\u2211\nRj\neiK\u00b5.Rj \u03d5j(r\u2212Rj), (4)\nGm (r) =\n1\u221a\nN\nN\u2211\nRj\neiK\u00b5.Rj \u03d5j(r\u2212Rj)(r \u2212Rj), (5)\nare Bloch type functions constructed from the atomic orbitals, Rj is the position of an atom in real space and the\nsummation is over the number of unit cells N \u001d 1. The functions \u03c8m (r) are components of the envelope function\n\u03a8 (q, r). Substituting this expression for \u03a8tot into the Schro\u00a8dinger equation and integrating with respect to fast\ndegrees of freedom that vary on the scale of the unit cell leads to the Dirac equation Eq.(1) for the envelope function\n\u03a8. We label the two non-equivalent K-points as K and K\u02dc with wavevectorsK = (\u00b14pi\/3a, 0), and the components of\n\u03a8 are written in the order KA, KB, K\u02dcB, K\u02dcA. The appearance of the chiral angle of the tube \u03b7 in the Dirac equation\nshows that the axes of the (x\u2032, y\u2032) \u201cgraphite\u201d coordinate system have been rotated to be transverse and parallel to\nthe tube axis, labelled (x, y) in Fig. 1. Applying periodic boundary conditions to the wavefunction \u03a8tot, Eq.(3), in\nthe direction transverse to the nanotube axis produces a condition for the envelope function \u03a8 that leads to metallic\nor semiconducting behaviour depending on whether the transverse component of wavevector q is allowed to be zero\n[23, 24].\nIn order to highlight the separate K-point space and AB space structure present in carbon nanotubes we adopt a\nmatrix direct product notation using {\u03c3x, \u03c3y , \u03c3z, I\u03c3} for 2\u00d7 2 Pauli matrices and the unit matrix that operate within\na block (\u2018AB space\u2019) and {\u03a0x,\u03a0y,\u03a0z, I\u03a0} for 2\u00d7 2 Pauli matrices and the unit matrix that operate in K-point space.\nFor example, the operator \u03b1 may be written as \u03b1 = \u03a0z \u2297 \u03c3, and the usual operators for the reflection of real spin in\n4a plane that reverses the Cartesian coordinate n = x, y or z are \u03c1n = i\u03a0x \u2297 ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2\u03c3ne\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2. As mentioned in the\nIntroduction, the pseudospin of a 2D graphite sheet does not transform in the same way as real spin because certain\ntransformations result in a swapping of the orientation of A and B atoms. This additional operation is described\nby the \u201cpseudospin-flip\u201d operator, Eq. (2), \u03c1z = \u03a0x \u2297 i\u03c3z that corresponds to a reflection of real spin in the (x, y)\nplane. For example, an active rotation of the 2D graphite sheet anticlockwise by pi\/3 about the perpendicular z axis,\n\u03a8 (r\u2032) = C6\u03a8(r), is described by C6 = \u03c1zR(pi\/3) = \u03a0x \u2297 exp ((2pii\/3)\u03c3z) where R(\u03b8) = I\u03a0 \u2297 exp ((i\u03b8\/2)\u03c3z) is a\ncontinuous rotation operator.\nWe consider the nanotube axis to be parallel to the unit vector n\u02c6 = (sin \u03b7, cos \u03b7, 0) in the (x\u2032, y\u2032) graphite coordinates,\nso that it points along the y-axis in the (x, y) nanotube coordinates, Fig. (1). In this rotated coordinate system, the\ncomponent of the pseudospin operator along the positive y-axis is \u03a3a = I\u03a0\u2297ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2\u03c3ye\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 and the pseudo-helicity\noperator is \u03bb = |q|\u22121 I\u03a0 \u2297 ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 (\u2212i\u03c3y\u2202y) e\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2. For an armchair tube, a mirror reflection across the nanotube\naxis (the y-axis in Fig. (1)) is accompanied by an exchange of A and B atomic positions so that it is described not by\noperator \u03c1x but by the combination \u03c1z\u03c1x representing reflection of real spin accompainied by an additional spin-flip.\nIt turns out that \u03a3a = i\u03c1z\u03c1x, so we may draw the conclusion that, for an armchair tube, the operator measuring\npseudospin also represents a mirror reflection across the nanotube axis. The situation is different for a zigzag tube\nbecause reflection across the nanotube axis (the y\u2032-axis in Fig. (1)) is not accompanied by an exchange of A and B\natomic positions so that it is described by operator \u03c1x, not \u03a3a = i\u03c1z\u03c1x. This means that potential positions that\nare symmetric with respect to mirror reflection across the axis of an armchair tube, such as positions D1 and D4 in\nFig. (1), will also be symmetric with respect to the pseudospin operator and will break degeneracy without mixing\nthe pseudospin eigenvectors. Since pseudospin is related to the underlying molecular orbital state [25], this statement\nis equivalent to saying that impurities preserving mirror reflection in the nanotube axis do not result in mixing of\nthe bonding pi and antibonding pi\u2217 energy bands [18, 19, 20, 26, 27]. On the other hand, potential positions that are\nsymmetric with respect to mirror reflection across the axis of a zigzag tube, such as positions A3 and B1 in Fig. (1),\nwill not be symmetric with respect to the pseudospin operator.\nIII. SINGLE PARTICLE ENERGY SPECTRUM OF A CLOSED NANOTUBE\nIn this section we calculate the form of non-interacting single particle standing waves and the corresponding energy\nspectrum in a closed nanotube. For simplicity, we will consider only metallic nanotubes with arbitrary chiral angle\n\u03b7. We suppose that the x axis is perpendicular to the tube axis and we consider only the zero momentum transverse\nmode so that |E| < 2piv\/Lc where Lc = |Ch| is the circumference. The Dirac equation is diagonal in K-point space,\nso that, for an open nanotube, there are two right moving (\u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\n) and two left moving (\u03a8\n(L)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\n) plane\nwave solutions:\n\u03a8\n(R)\nK = Ae\niqy\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\nise\u2212i\u03b7\n0\n0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ; \u03a8(L)K = Be\u2212iqy\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1\n\u2212ise\u2212i\u03b7\n0\n0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ;\n\u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\n= Ceiqy\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0\n0\n1\n\u2212ise\u2212i\u03b7\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ; \u03a8(L)K\u02dc = De\u2212iqy\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0\n0\n1\nise\u2212i\u03b7\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\nwhere A, B, C and D are arbitrary constants, q is the wavevector along the tube and we consider q \u2265 0 and E = svq,\ns = \u00b11. The solutions \u03a8(R)K and \u03a8(L)K\u02dc are eigenvectors of pseudospin component \u03a3a with eigenvalue +s, whereas the\nsolutions \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK have eigenvalue \u2212s. Also, the solutions \u03a8(R)K and \u03a8(L)K are eigenvectors of pseudo-helicity \u03bb\nwith eigenvalue +s, whereas the solutions \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nhave eigenvalue \u2212s.\nNote that the Hamiltonian H2d given in Eq. (1) is two dimensional, but, by taking into account only the lowest\n5transverse mode, it becomes one dimensional H1d in a metallic tube:\nH2d = v\u03a0z \u2297 ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 (\u2212i\u03c3x\u2202x \u2212 i\u03c3y\u2202y) e\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2, (6)\nH1d = v\u03a0z \u2297 ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 (\u2212i\u03c3y\u2202y) e\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2, (7)\nThe pseudospin part of the one dimensional Hamiltonian H1d may be diagonalised using a unitary transformation,\nH\u02dc1d = U\u22121H1dU [28]:\nU = I\u03a0\u221a\n2\n\u2297 ei\u03b7\u03c3z\/2 (\u03c3y + \u03c3z) e\u2212i\u03b7\u03c3z\/2, (8)\nH\u02dc1d = v\u03a0z \u2297 (\u2212i\u03c3z\u2202y) , (9)\nand the corresponding eigenvectors \u03a8\u02dc\n(L\/R)\nK\/K\u02dc\n= U\u22121\u03a8(L\/R)\nK\/K\u02dc\nare eigenvectors of \u03c3z in pseudospin space so they have only\none non-zero component out of four.\nNow we will briefly describe the effective boundary conditions for the envelope function \u03a8 in a closed carbon\nnanotube, and refer the reader to Ref. [15] for more details. There it was shown that energy independent hard wall\nboundary conditions for the Dirac equation may be expressed in general terms as\n\u03a8 =M\u03a8; M2 = 1; {nB.\u03b1,M} = 0, (10)\nwhere M is an Hermitian, unitary 4\u00d7 4 matrix M2 = 1 with the constraint that it anticommutes with the operator\nnB.\u03b1, proportional to the component of the current operator normal to the interface, nB is the unit vector normal\nto the interface. There are four possible linear combinations of matrices satisfying these constraints on M , which,\nassuming nB is a vector confined to the (x, y) plane, may be written in terms of a small number of arbitrary parameters:\nM1 = cos\u039b (I\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3) + sin\u039b (\u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3) , (11)\nM2 = cos\u03a5 (\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3) + sin\u03a5 (\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 nB.\u03c3) , (12)\nM3 = cos\u2126 (\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 nB.\u03c3) + sin\u2126 (I\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3) , (13)\nM4 = cos\u0398 (\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3) + sin\u0398 (\u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3) , (14)\nwhere the angles \u039b,\u03a5,\u0398 and \u2126 are arbitrary, n1 and n2 are three-dimensional space-like vectors satisfying the con-\nstraints n1.nB = n2.nB = n1.n2 = 0, and \u03bd1 and \u03bd2 are two-dimensional (confined to the (x, y) plane) space-like\nvectors satisfying the constraint \u03bd1.\u03bd2 = 0.\nIn principle, there are different ways of combining the right and left moving plane waves in order to create standing\nwaves. The first possibility is that waves at the same K-point combine, namely \u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK form a standing wave\nwith pseudo-helicity eigenvalue +s, and \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nform a standing wave with pseudo-helicity eigenvalue \u2212s.\nThis situation is realised by the matrix M1, Eq.(11), because it is diagonal in K-point space. A second possibility is\nthat waves from opposite K-points combine, namely \u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK\u02dc\nform a standing wave with pseudospin component\neigenvalue +s, and \u03a8\n(R)\nK\u02dc\nand \u03a8\n(L)\nK form a standing wave with pseudospin component eigenvalue \u2212s. This situation is\nrealised by the matrix M2, Eq.(12), because it is off-diagonal in K-point space. A third possibility is a combination of\nthe previous two, with waves scattered back at the boundary into a mixture of both of the K-points. This situation is\nrealised by the matrices M3, Eq.(13), and M4, Eq.(14), because they have both diagonal and off-diagonal in K-point\nspace parts.\nIn the graphite coordinate system, we define the normal to the boundary nB in terms of the chiral angle of the\ntube \u03b7 and we choose two mutually orthogonal 3D vectors n1 and n2, and two additional orthogonal 2D vectors \u03bd1\nand \u03bd2:\nnB = (sin \u03b7, cos \u03b7, 0),\nn1 = (cos \u03b7 sin \u03b6,\u2212 sin \u03b7 sin \u03b6, cos \u03b6) ,\nn2 = (cos \u03b7 cos \u03b6,\u2212 sin \u03b7 cos \u03b6,\u2212 sin \u03b6) ,\n\u03bd1 = (cos \u03be, sin \u03be, 0) ,\n\u03bd2 = (\u2212 sin \u03be, cos \u03be, 0) ,\n6This introduces two new mixing angles, \u03b6 and \u03be: the arbitrary parameters contained within the boundary conditions\ndescribe the amount of mixing between different discrete symmetries. Table 1 shows a summary of the discrete\nsymmetries of the boundary conditions in terms of the orientation of the vectors n1, n2, \u03bd1 and \u03bd2. In addition to \u03c1z\nand \u03a3a we consider parity P = \u03a0x\u2297I\u03c3, corresponding to a rotation by pi about the z axis (x\u2192 \u2212x and y \u2192 \u2212y), and\ncharge conjugation (C) that involves the complex conjugation operator combined with C = \u2212i\u03a0y \u2297 \u03c3y. The angles \u03b6\nand \u03be mix terms with different symmetry with respect to \u03c1z: \u03b6 = 0 and \u03be = 0 correspond to evenness with respect\nto \u03c1z whereas \u03b6 = pi\/2 and \u03be = pi\/2 correspond to oddness. Since pseudospin and\/or pseudo-helicity label different\nstates at the same energy, values of \u03b6 and \u03be not equal to multiples of pi\/2 will lead to broken degeneracy. The angles\n\u039b,\u03a5,\u0398 and \u2126 mix different symmetries with respect to combinations of P , C and \u03c1z.\nM \u03c1z P C \u03a3a\nI\u03a0 \u2297 n1.\u03c3 n1 = (\u02c6\u0131, \uf6be\u02c6) \u03b6 = pi2 \u22121 +1 +1 \u22121\nn1 = k\u02c6 \u03b6 = 0 +1 +1 +1 \u22121\n\u03a0z \u2297 n2.\u03c3 n2 = (\u02c6\u0131, \uf6be\u02c6) \u03b6 = 0 +1 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\nn2 = k\u02c6 \u03b6 =\npi\n2 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121 \u22121\n\u03bd1.\u03a0\u2297 I\u03c3 \u03bd1 = \u0131\u02c6 \u03be = 0 +1 +1 +1 +1\n\u03bd1 = \uf6be\u02c6 \u03be =\npi\n2 \u22121 \u22121 +1 +1\n\u03bd2.\u03a0\u2297 nB.\u03c3 \u03bd2 = \u2212\u0131\u02c6 \u03be = pi2 \u22121 +1 \u22121 +1\n\u03bd2 = \uf6be\u02c6 \u03be = 0 +1 \u22121 \u22121 +1\nTable 1: Discrete symmetries of the boundary conditions\nAs representative examples, we consider below the boundary conditions M1 (diagonal) and M2 (off-diagonal)\nseparately. We will calculate the form of the standing waves and the energy spectrum for a nanotube with the same\ntype of boundary condition on the right (at y = +L\/2) and on the left (at y = \u2212L\/2). We introduce an index\nu = {R,L} \u2261 \u00b11 to label the right and left hand side so that the normal to the boundary, defined with respect to the\ngraphite coordinate system, is nB = u(sin \u03b7, cos \u03b7, 0), and we take into account the possibility of different mixing angles,\n\u039bu,\u03a5u,\u0398u and \u2126u, and vectors n1 = (u cos \u03b7 sin \u03b6u,\u2212u sin \u03b7 sin \u03b6u, cos \u03b6u), n2 = (u cos \u03b7 cos \u03b6u,\u2212u sin\u03b7 cos \u03b6u,\u2212 sin \u03b6u),\n\u03bd1 = (cos \u03beu, sin \u03beu, 0) and \u03bd2 = (\u2212 sin \u03beu, cos \u03beu, 0).\nA. Diagonal boundary conditions\nWith the above definitions of the mixing angles, the boundary condition \u03a8 =M1\u03a8 produces the following relations\nbetween the components of the wavefunction at the interface:\nu sin (\u03b6u + \u039bu) e\n\u2212i\u03b7\u03c8AK \u2212 [1 + cos (\u03b6u + \u039bu)]\u03c8BK = 0, (15)\nu sin (\u03b6u \u2212 \u039bu) e+i\u03b7\u03c8AK\u02dc \u2212 [1\u2212 cos (\u03b6u \u2212 \u039bu)]\u03c8BK\u02dc = 0. (16)\nThe equations are diagonal in K-point space so do not describe intervalley scattering. With these boundary\nconditions on the right (at y = +L\/2) and on the left (at y = \u2212L\/2), standing waves \u03a81 corresponding to K-point\nK are created from combining \u03a8\n(R)\nK and \u03a8\n(L)\nK and are labelled by pseudo-helicity \u03bb = +s, and standing waves \u03a82\n70.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n0.0\n1.0\n\u22120.5 0.0 0.5\ny\/L\n0.0\n1.0\nFIG. 2: Plot of the modulus squared wavefunction |\u03a81|\n2 of the lowest states for diagonal boundary conditions: the solid lines\nshow the second component |\u03c8BK |\n2 and the dashed lines show the first component |\u03c8AK |\n2.

Using E = svq shows that the mixing angles \u03b6R and \u03b6L break K-point degeneracy whereas \u039bR\nand \u039bL break electron-hole symmetry.\nIn order to understand the form of the wavefunctions, we set all mixing angles equal to zero \u03b6p = \u03b6m = \u039bp = \u039bm = 0.\nIn this case the boundary conditions simplify to \u03c8BK = \u03c8BK\u02dc = 0 at both ends of the nanotube, and the components\n\u03c8BK and \u03c8BK\u02dc have the form of standing wave solutions of the Schro\u00a8dinger equation for a confined particle, namely\nsuccessive cosine and sine functions.

The angle \u03bem breaks degeneracy whereas \u03a5p breaks electron-hole symmetry.\nThe physical relevance of the envelope wavefunctions may be understood by examining the total wavefunction \u03a8tot,\nEq. (3), that is constructed from linear combinations of products of envelope wavefunctions with Bloch functions that\nvary rapidly in space on the atomic scale. If we only take into account the first term in the gradient expansion, Eq. (3),\nand the contribution from a single atomic orbital at r = RA or RB, then \u03a8tot,1(2) is the sum of two components of\n\u03a81(2), each multiplied by an additional oscillating factor exp(iK\u00b5.Rj). For example, if we set \u03a5m = \u03bep = 0 for an\narmchair tube \u03b7 = pi\/6 then\n\u03a8tot,1(r) \u221d\n{\ncos (q1y +K.r\u2213 pi\/6) : s(\u22121)p1 = +1\nsin (q1y +K.r\u2213 pi\/6) : s(\u22121)p1 = \u22121\n\u03a8tot,2(r) \u221d\n{\nsin (q2y \u2212K.r\u00b1 pi\/6) : s(\u22121)p2 = +1\ncos (q2y \u2212K.r\u00b1 pi\/6) : s(\u22121)p2 = \u22121\nwhere the upper sign refers to r = RA and the lower to r = RB.

In order to ensure that the\nsuccessive wavefunctions are not degenerate, we take \u03bem = pi\/4 and \u03a5p = \u2212pi\/2 so that the four lowest states above\nthe Fermi level have energies E = piv\/(4L), 3piv\/(4L), 5piv\/(4L), 7piv\/(4L) with wavevector indices p1 = 0, p2 = 0,\np1 = 1, p2 = 1, and respective correspondence to the wavefunctions drawn schematically in Fig. 1 (d), (a), (c), (b) of\nRef.

DEGENERATE PERTURBATION THEORY IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IMPURITY\nIn this section we derive 4\u00d74 Hamiltonians of the effective mass model describing a short range potential at different\npositions R in the nanotube wall. Each effective Hamiltonian has a different structure, depending on the location of\nthe potential with respect to the hexagonal graphite unit cell. The following subsections describe different impurity\npositions as shown in Fig. 1 and summarised in Table 2.\nImpurity position with respect Label in Discussed in\nto the graphite unit cell Fig.1 subsection:\natomic site Ai, Bi IVA\ncentre of unit cell C IVB\nhalf-way along a bond Di IVC\nTable 2: Impurity positions discussed in the following subsections\nAs well as degeneracy arising from the real spin of electrons, it was shown in the previous section that the energy\nlevels of a clean metallic nanotube may be degenerate due to pseudospin symmetry, depending on the symmetry of\nthe boundary conditions. Now we would like to concentrate on the role of an additional perturbing potential, so we\nwill consider the case of degenerate levels in the clean nanotube, and use degenerate perturbation theory to calculate\nthe level splitting due to the presence of the potential Hamiltonian. The perturbation theory takes into account the\ninteraction of the potential with the degenerate levels, but neglects the effect of higher levels, so it is valid for energy\nlevel shifts that are smaller than the spacing \u2206E = piv\/L between pairs of unperturbed levels. As before, we suppose\nthat the x axis is perpendicular to the tube axis and we consider only the zero momentum transverse mode so that\n|E| < 2piv\/Lc where Lc = |Ch| is the circumference. We will use off-diagonal boundary conditions M2 because they\ncorrespond to the usual situation in metallic nanotubes [15], so the unperturbed degenerate wavefunctions are \u03a81 and\n\u03a82, Eqs. (23) and (24), respectively, with \u03beR = \u03beL = 0 corresponding to pseudospin symmetry preserving boundaries,\nq1 = q2 \u2261 q, p1 = p2 \u2261 p, and q = (pip\u2212 s\u03a5p)\/L.\nAs explained in Section II, we perform a gradient expansion of the total wavefunction, Eq. (3), and keep the lowest\norder term. Then, we calculate matrix elements Vmn =\n\u222b\ndr\u03a8\u2217m\u03b4H\u03a8n between the clean wavefunctions Eqs. (23)\nand (24) and the effective Hamiltonians in order to apply degenerate perturbation theory. The matrix elements for a\ngeneral effective Hamiltonian with arbitrary coefficients are given in Appendix A: a particular position of the potential\nwill define the values of the arbitrary coefficients. The positions of the potential we consider are shown with relation\nto the hexagonal graphite unit cell in Fig. 1. They are near an A type atomic site, labelled A in the figure, near\na B type atomic site, labelled B, near the centre of the unit cell, labelled C, or near the half-way point between\nneighbouring atoms, labelled D. Furthermore, we introduce a small additional deviation of the potential position \u03b4R,\nthe orientation of which is shown in the figure for the potential near the unit cell centre. The labels (x\u2032, y\u2032) represent\nthe coordinate axes of the graphite sheet, whereas labels (x, y) represent the coordinate axes of the nanotube, rotated\nby the chiral angle \u03b7. The nanotube axis is parallel to the y direction, and the direction of the deviation of the\npotential position is described by angle \u03c7 in the nanotube coordinates \u03b4R = (\u03b4R cos\u03c7, \u03b4R sin\u03c7) \u2261 (\u03b4X, \u03b4Y ).\nA. Potential near an atomic site\nThe origin of real space coordinates is placed in the centre of the Wigner-Seitz unit cell and the perturbative\npotential is placed at position R = R0 + \u03b4R near an arbitrary atomic site. For example it may be near an A site,\nFig. 1, so that R0 = RA represents the exact position of the A atom, and \u03b4R is a small additional deviation from it.\nIn deriving the effective mass model Hamiltonian, we take into account nearest neighbour interactions: within nearest\nneighbour distance d = a\/\n\u221a\n3 of the perturbative potential, there is one A atom and three B atoms. In addition to\n11\nthe gradient expansion, we perform an expansion in the small additional deviation of the potential position \u03b4R in\norder to generate a number of effective Hamiltonians with different symmetries.\nThe effective Hamiltonian \u03b4H is a 4\u00d74 Hamiltonian with matrix elements involving the Bloch function \u03a6(0)m , Eq. (4),\nand a short ranged potential \u03b4H (r) of strength U :\n\u03b4Hnm =\n\u222b\nddr\u03a6(0)\u2217n (r) \u03b4H (r) \u03a6(0)m (r) (27)\nIntegration with respect to fast degrees of freedom that vary on the scale of the unit cell produces a product of\nBloch functions \u03a6\n(0)\nm evaluated at the potential position and a delta function representing the fact that the envelope\nwavefunctions interact with a localised potential of scale less than the graphite lattice constant a:\n\u03b4Hnm \u2261 vaULd\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\u03a6(0)\u2217n (R)\u03a6(0)m (R) (28)\nHere va is the volume of the graphite unit cell. There is a strong dependence of the phase factors contained within the\nBloch functions \u03a6\n(0)\nm on the position of the potential within the graphite unit cell. The Bloch functions also depend\non pi-type atomic orbitals \u03d5j on the non-equivalent atomic sites j = {A,B} in the unit cell. Since we consider the\nperturbative potential to be in the same plane as the carbon atoms, we only need to describe the behaviour of the\natomic orbitals in the (x, y) coordinates. They are radially symmetric in the plane and for simplicity we model them\nas \u03d5A\/B(r) \u2261 \u03d5(r) = \u03d50 exp(\u2212|r|\/\u03bb) where \u03bb \u223c a\/\n\u221a\n3.\nFor the potential exactly on an A site, \u03b4R = 0, the effective Hamiltonian is\n\u03b4HA = v\n2\na\u03d5\n2(0)U\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 e\u2212i\u03ba\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\ne+i\u03ba 0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (29)\nwhere \u03ba is a phase factor associated with intervalley scattering at the impurity \u03ba = R0.(K \u2212 K\u02dc). As expected for a\npotential on an atomic site, this Hamiltonian breaks pseudospin-flip symmetry \u03b4HA 6= \u03c1\u22121z \u03b4HA\u03c1z. For completeness,\nwe note that the equivalent effective Hamiltonian for an impurity near a B site, Fig. 1, is\n\u03b4HB = v\n2\na\u03d5\n2(0)U\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 e\u2212i\u03ba 0\n0 e+i\u03ba 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (30)\nApplying the general results for matrix elements given in Appendix A to the effective Hamiltonians \u03b4HA\/B, we find\nthat V12V21 = V11V22 so that the energy level shifts are \u03b4E\n\u2032 = 0 and \u03b4E\u2032\u2032 = V11 + V22. In terms of the model\nparameters,\n\u03b4E\u2032\u2032 =\nv2a\u03d5\n2(0)U\nLcL\n[1 + as(\u22121)p cos (\u03ba+ a\u03b7) sin (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m)] , (31)\nwhere q = (pip \u2212 s\u03a5p)\/L and \u2212L\/2 < Y0 < L\/2 is the coordinate of the perturbative potential along the nanotube\naxis. Here the factor a = \u00b11 is used to distinguish between the case of the potential being near an A site a = 1 or near\na B site a = \u22121. There is an oscillating dependence of the energy level shift on the index p of the clean energy levels\nthat has a period equal to 1\/(Y0\/L). In terms of energy, and the spacing of pairs of degenerate levels \u2206E = piv\/L, the\nperiod is \u2206E\/(Y0\/L) = piv\/Y0. Fig. 6 shows the splitting of the two levels as a function of the energy for two different\npotential positions. The upper curve is for Y0 = 0.025L (potential is one twentieth of the way from the centre of the\nnanotube to the end), and shows an oscillating pattern with period 40, whereas the lower curve is for Y0 = 0.125L\n(potential is a quarter of the way from the centre of the nanotube to the end), and shows an oscillating pattern with\nperiod 8.\nThe degenerate perturbation theory produces two new zero-order wavefunctions that are linear combinations of the\noriginal ones.

The upper curve is for the potential at\nY0 = 0.025L (potential is one twentieth of the way from the centre of the nanotube to the end), lower curve is for Y0 = 0.125L\n(potential is a quarter of the way from the centre of the nanotube to the end). Parameter values are s = 1, \u03ba = 2pi\/3, \u03b7 = pi\/6,\n\u03a5p = \u03a5m = 0, and the angle of deviation of the potential is \u03c7 = pi\/4.\nIn this case the Hamiltonian is\n\u03b4HA + \u03b4HB = v\n2\na\u03d5\n2(0)U\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 e\u2212i\u03ba\n0 1 e\u2212i\u03b2 0\n0 e+i\u03b2 1 0\ne+i\u03ba 0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (32)\nwhere \u03ba = RA.(K\u2212 K\u02dc) and \u03b2 = RB.(K\u2212 K\u02dc).

Alternatively,\nusing the unitary transformation U , Eq.

(33)\nReturning to a single impurity potential on an atomic site, and taking into account first order terms in the deviation\n\u03b4R of the potential position, we find an effective Hamiltonian with a different structure:\n\u03b4H \u2032A\/B = U\n\u2032\nA\/B\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 iae\u2212i\u03c7\u02dc \u2212ieia\u03c7\u02dc\u2212i\u03ba 0\n\u2212iae+i\u03c7\u02dc 0 0 \u2212ieia\u03c7\u02dc\u2212i\u03ba\nie\u2212ia\u03c7\u02dc+i\u03ba 0 0 iae\u2212i\u03c7\u02dc\n0 ie\u2212ia\u03c7\u02dc+i\u03ba \u2212iae+i\u03c7\u02dc 0\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (34)\n14\nwhere U \u2032A\/B = 3 |\u03b4R| e\u2212d\/\u03bbv2a\u03d52(|\u03b4R|)U\/2\u03bb and \u03c7\u02dc = \u03c7\u2212\u03b7 is the angle of the deviation \u03b4R in the graphite coordinates\nas shown in Fig. 1. The factor a = \u00b11 is used to distinguish between the case of the potential being near an A site\na = 1 or near a B site a = \u22121. We find that the energy level shifts are\n\u03b4E = \u2212\nU \u2032A\/B\nLcL\n(\u22121)p cos (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m) sin (\u03ba+ a\u03b7 \u2212 a\u03c7)\n\u00b1\nU \u2032A\/B\nLcL\n\u221a\n[1 + as(\u22121)p sin (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m) cos (\u03ba+ a\u03b7)] [1 + as(\u22121)p sin (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m) cos (\u03ba+ a\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03c7)]. (35)\nwhere \u03c7 is the angle of the deviation of the potential in the nanotube coordinates. Fig. 8 shows the splitting of the\nenergy levels as a function of the energy for two different potential positions. The upper curve is for Y0 = 0.025L\n(potential is one twentieth of the way from the centre of the nanotube to the end), and shows an oscillating pattern\nwith period 40, whereas the lower curve is for Y0 = 0.125L (potential is a quarter of the way from the centre of the\nnanotube to the end), and shows an oscillating pattern with period 8. The oscillation periods are the same as for the\nHamiltonian \u03b4HA, but this time there is a shift of both of the energy levels, one positive, one negative, instead of one\nof the levels remaining stationary while the other moves.\nB. Impurity at the centre of the unit cell\nIn this section, we consider the perturbative potential to be placed near the centre of the graphite unit cell, position\nC in Fig. 1. For the zeroth order gradient term, we find that the effective Hamiltonian for the potential exactly at\nthe centre of the unit cell is equal to zero: such a position does not break the rotational symmetry of graphene. The\nfirst non-zero contribution arises from a quadratic deviation from the centre of the unit cell:\n\u03b4HC = iUC\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 e2i\u03c7\u02dc \u2212e\u2212i\u03ba \u2212e2i\u03c7\u02dc\u2212i\u03ba\ne\u22122i\u03c7\u02dc 1 \u2212e\u22122i\u03c7\u02dc\u2212i\u03ba \u2212e\u2212i\u03ba\n\u2212e+i\u03ba \u2212e2i\u03c7\u02dc+i\u03ba 1 e+2i\u03c7\u02dc\n\u2212e\u22122i\u03c7\u02dc+i\u03ba \u2212e+i\u03ba e\u22122i\u03c7\u02dc 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (36)\nwhere UC = (3 |\u03b4R| \/(2\u03bb))2 v2a\u03d52(d)U . Applying degenerate perturbation theory in the same way as before we find\nthat the energy level shifts are \u03b4E\u2032 = 0 and \u03b4E\u2032\u2032 = V11 + V22. In terms of the model parameters,\n\u03b4E\u2032\u2032 =\n2UC\nLcL\n[1\u2212 (\u22121)p cos (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m) cos\u03ba+ s(\u22121)p sin (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m) sin (3\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03c7) sin\u03ba] , (37)\nThe results are similar to those for the potential exactly on an atomic site: one of the energy levels does not move\nand corresponds to a linear combination of clean wavefunctions that has zero matrix element with the effective\nHamiltonian, whereas the other energy level suffers a shift that oscillates with the index p and has a period equal to\n1\/(Y0\/L). Fig. 9 shows the energy level splitting as a function of the energy for two different potential positions. The\nupper curve is for Y0 = 0.025L (potential is one twentieth of the way from the centre of the nanotube to the end), and\nshows an oscillating pattern with period 40, whereas the lower curve is for Y0 = 0.125L (potential is a quarter of the\nway from the centre of the nanotube to the end), and shows an oscillating pattern with period 8. The oscillation of\nthe level splitting as a function of energy with a period determined by the position Y0 of the impurity along the tube\naxis, \u2212L\/2 < Y0 < L\/2, may be understood as arising from the slow spatial modulation of the envelope wavefunctions\nsince, for standing waves, the positions of peaks and nodes vary as a function of energy. Therefore the extent to which\nthey scatter from a given impurity position also depends on their energy.\nThe dependence of the energy level shift on \u03b7 and \u03c7 arises because the position of the impurity determines the\nextent of degeneracy breaking. As a special case, we note that when the angle of deviation of the impurity is\n\u03c7 = pi\/2 (see Fig. 1), the Hamiltonian \u03b4HC preserves axis reflection symmetry for an armchair tube and the factor\nsin (3\u03b7 \u2212 2\u03c7) = \u22121. Degeneracy is still broken but there are no off-diagonal matrix elements V12 = V21 = 0 and no\nmixing of the pseudospin eigenvectors. Alternatively, using the unitary transformation U , Eq.

We find that the matrix elements are\nV11\/22 =\nUD\n2LcL\n{2\u00b1 2s sin (\u03b7 + \u03b1\u2212 \u03b2)\n+2(\u22121)p cos (\u03b1+ \u03b2 \u00b1 (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m))\n\u00b1s(\u22121)p sin (2\u03b1+ \u03b7 \u00b1 (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m))\n\u2213s(\u22121)p sin (2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b7 \u00b1 (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m))} ,\nV12V21 =\n(\nUD\n2LcL\n)2\n{cos (2\u03b1+ \u03b7) + cos (2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b7)\n+2(\u22121)p cos (\u03b7 + \u03b1\u2212 \u03b2) cos (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m)}2 .\n16\nGenerally, there are two non-zero energy shifts, the exact values of which depend on the phase factors \u03b1 and \u03b2 that\nmay take the values 0, 2pi\/3, or \u22122pi\/3, depending on the particular position: there are six D positions shown in\nFig. 1.\nHowever, as a special case, we note that for positions D1 and D4 in Fig. 1 the Hamiltonian \u03b4HD preserves axis\nreflection symmetry \u03a3\u22121a \u03b4HD\u03a3a = \u03b4HD for an armchair tube \u03b7 = pi\/6. Degeneracy is still broken but there are no\noff-diagonal matrix elements V12 = V21 = 0 and no mixing of the pseudospin eigenvectors. For example, \u03b1 = 0 and\n\u03b2 = 2pi\/3 for position D1 and, using the unitary transformation U , Eq. (8), to change to the system where the clean\nwavefunctions are eigenvalues of \u03c3z, it is possible to produce a matrix that has no off-diagonal spin parts and clearly\ndoes not mix the pseudospin eigenfunctions:\nU\u22121\u03b4HDU = 2iUD\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 \u2212epii\/3\n0 0 0 0\n0 \u2212e\u2212pii\/3 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 . (40)\nSince pseudospin is related to the underlying molecular orbital state [25], the statement that impurities preserving\nmirror reflection in the nanotube axis manage to break degeneracy without mixing the pseudospin eigenvectors\nis equivalent to saying that impurities preserving mirror reflection do not result in mixing of the bonding pi and\nantibonding pi\u2217 energy bands [18, 19, 20, 26, 27].\nV. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we considered degeneracy breaking due to short-ranged impurities in finite, single-wall, metallic carbon\nnanotubes. The effective mass model was used to describe the slowly varying spatial envelope wavefunctions of spinless\nelectrons near the Fermi level at two inequivalent valleys (K-points) in terms of the four component Dirac equation for\nmassless fermions, with the role of spin assumed by pseudospin due to the relative amplitude of the wave function on\nthe sublattice atoms. Using boundary conditions at the ends of the tube that neither break valley degeneracy nor mix\npseudospin eigenvectors, we used degenerate perturbation theory to study the influence of impurities. The position of\na short-ranged impurity potential within the hexagonal graphite unit cell produces a particular 4\u00d74 matrix structure\nof the corresponding effective Hamiltonian, and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian with respect to pseudospin flip and\nmirror reflection in the nanotube axis is related to degeneracy breaking and pseudospin mixing, respectively. Table 3\nshows a summary of the position dependence for an armchair tube [axis is parallel to the y-axis in Fig. (1)]. It shows\nhow the character of an impurity determines the extent of valley degeneracy breaking, resulting in the possibility\nto observe experimentally either twofold or fourfold periodicity of shell filling [9]. For example, an impurity on an\natomic site will break valley degeneracy and tend to give twofold periodicity, corresponding to spin degeneracy only,\nwhereas a potential at the centre of the graphite unit cell will not break valley degeneracy and it will preserve fourfold\nperiodicity corresponding to both spin and valley degeneracy.\nImpurity position with respect Label in Breaks valley Breaks axis\nto the graphite unit cell Fig.1 degeneracy reflection symmetry\natomic site Ai, Bi yes yes\ncentre of unit cell C no no\nmidway along a bond that is D1, D4 yes no\nperpendicular to tube axis\nmidway along a bond D2, D3, D5, D6 yes yes\nat 30\u25e6 angle with tube axis\nTable 3: The dependence of degeneracy breaking on the impurity position for an armchair nanotube\n17\nIn addition to position dependence on the scale of the graphite unit cell, the level splitting displays a sinusoidally\nvarying energy dependence that has a period determined by the position Y0 of the impurity along the tube axis\n\u2212L\/2 < Y0 < L\/2. This arises from the slow spatial modulation of the envelope wavefunctions since, for standing\nwaves, the location of peaks and nodes varies as a function of energy. Therefore the extent to which they scatter from\na given impurity position also depends on their energy. It means that, in experimental observations, the shell filling\nproperties may not be the same in different parts of the spectrum.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank EPSRC for financial support.\nAPPENDIX A: GENERAL FORM OF THE MATRIX ELEMENTS OF DEGENERATE PERTURBATION\nTHEORY\nIn this appendix, we present expressions for matrix elements Vmn =\n\u222b\ndr\u03a8\u2217m\u03b4H\u03a8n between the clean wavefunctions\nEqs. (23) and (24) and a general effective Hamiltonian with arbitrary coefficients. We set \u03beR = \u03beL = 0 corresponding\nto pseudospin symmetry preserving boundaries, q1 = q2 \u2261 q, p1 = p2 \u2261 p, and q = (pip \u2212 s\u03a5p)\/L. The only\nconstraints we apply to the general effective Hamiltonian are due to hermicity and time reversal symmetry, because\nthese constraints are obeyed by every specific effective Hamiltonian that we derive. The results are used in Section IV\nwhere a particular position of the potential corresponds to particular values of the arbitrary coefficients.\nWe use the constraints of hermicity and time reversal symmetry to write a general effective Hamiltonian as\n\u03b4H = U\u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\na ce+i\u03b4 me\u2212i\u00b5 le\u2212i\u03b1\nce\u2212i\u03b4 b we\u2212i\u03b2 me\u2212i\u00b5\nmei\u00b5 wei\u03b2 b ce+i\u03b4\nlei\u03b1 mei\u00b5 ce\u2212i\u03b4 a\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (A1)\nwhere all the variables represent arbitrary real numbers. We find that the matrix elements are\nV11\/22 =\nU\n2LcL\n{a+ b\u00b1 2sc sin (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b4)\n+2m(\u22121)p cos (\u00b5\u00b1 (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m))\n\u00b1sl(\u22121)p sin (\u03b1+ \u03b7 \u00b1 (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m))\n\u2213sw(\u22121)p sin (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b7 \u00b1 (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m))} , (A2)\nV12V21 =\n(\nU\n2LcL\n)2\n{(\u22121)p (a\u2212 b) sin (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m)\n+2sc(\u22121)p cos (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b4) cos (2qY0 \u2212 s\u03a5m)\n+sl cos (\u03b1+ \u03b7) + sw cos (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b7)}2 . (A3)\nwhere the upper sign in Eq. (A2) refers to V11 and the lower to V22.\nThe Hamiltonian \u03b4H preserves axis reflection symmetry \u03a3\u22121a \u03b4H\u03a3a = \u03b4H for an armchair tube \u03b7 = pi\/6 if b = a,\nw = l, \u03b4 = 2pi\/3 and \u03b2 = \u03b1 \u2212 2pi\/3. Degeneracy is still broken but there are no off-diagonal matrix elements\nV12 = V21 = 0 and no mixing of the pseudospin eigenvectors. Using the unitary transformation U , Eq. (8), to\nchange to the system where the clean wavefunctions are eigenvalues of \u03c3z , it is possible to show explicitly that the\nHamiltonian preserving axis reflection symmetry has no off-diagonal spin parts and clearly does not mix the pseudospin\n18\neigenfunctions:\nU\u22121\u03b4HU = U \u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\na\u2212 c 0 m\u02dc\u2217 + l\u02dc\u2217 0\n0 a+ c 0 m\u02dc\u2217 \u2212 l\u02dc\u2217\nm\u02dc+ l\u02dc 0 a\u2212 c 0\n0 m\u02dc\u2212 l\u02dc 0 a+ c\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (A4)\nwhere m\u02dc = mei\u00b5 and l\u02dc = lei\u03b1\u2212pii\/3.\nThe Hamiltonian \u03b4H preserves pseudospin-flip symmetry \u03c1\u22121z \u03b4H\u03c1z = \u03b4H if b = a, c = 0, \u00b5 = 0 (or m = 0), and\nl = \u2212w and \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b2 (or l = w = 0), in which case V12V21 = V11 \u2212 V22 = 0 meaning that degeneracy is not broken.\nAPPENDIX B: NON-PERTURBATIVE DETERMINATION OF THE SPECTRUM IN THE PRESENCE\nOF AN IMPURITY\nIn this section, we present a non-perturbative calculation of the energy level spectrum in the presence of an impurity.\nWe consider the additional potential to be placed at an arbitrary position Y0 along the tube \u2212L\/2 \u2264 Y0 < L\/2, and\nwe use the off-diagonal boundary conditions, Section III B, at the ends of the tube y = \u00b1L\/2. Since the potential is a\ndelta function in space, the wavefunctions away from it are simply the solutions of the clean Hamiltonian. However,\nthe delta function potential does introduce non-trivial matching conditions at Y0 for the standing waves to the left\nand the right. In general, we have an equation of the form\n[\u2212iv\u03b1.\u2207+ \u03b4 (r\u2212R)V ] \u03a8 = E\u03a8 (B1)\nwhere V is a 4 \u00d7 4 matrix as found in Section IV. To produce the matching conditions, we integrate the equation\nwith respect to y over a vanishingly small interval Y0\u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 y \u2264 Y0+ \u03b4 near the additional potential. The first term in\nEq. (B1) gives a discontinuity in the components \u03c8m of the envelope wavefunction at the potential position, producing\nexpressions such as \u03c81 (Y0 + \u03b4) \u2212 \u03c81 (Y0 \u2212 \u03b4). The second term \u03b4 (r\u2212R)V\u03a8 gives the value of the wavefunction\ncomponents at the potential position and the term on the right hand side of Eq. (B1), E\u03a8, gives zero contribution:\nalthough \u03a8 is not necessarily continuous, it is not infinite. The wavefunctions are then determined, using the resulting\nmatching conditions, and the energy level spectrum is found. As before, we will consider only metallic nanotubes\nwith arbitrary chiral angle \u03b7. We suppose that the x axis is perpendicular to the tube axis and we consider only the\nzero momentum transverse mode so that |E| < 2piv\/Lc where Lc = |Ch| is the circumference.\nIn order to demonstrate what is in principle possible, we consider in detail the case of the additional potential\nexactly on an A site with the following effective Hamiltonian:\n\u03b4HA = UA \u03b4 (r\u2212R)\n\uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n1 0 0 e\u2212i\u03ba\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\ne+i\u03ba 0 0 1\n\uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 , (B2)\nwhere \u03ba is a phase factor associated with intervalley scattering at the impurity \u03ba = R0.(K \u2212 K\u02dc). It results in the\nfollowing matching conditions at the impurity,\n\u03c81 (Y0 + \u03b4)\u2212 \u03c81 (Y0 \u2212 \u03b4) = 0, (B3)\n\u03c82 (Y0 + \u03b4)\u2212 \u03c82 (Y0 \u2212 \u03b4) = ue\u2212i\u03b7\n[\n\u03c81 (Y0) + e\n\u2212i\u03ba\u03c84 (Y0)\n]\n, (B4)\n\u03c83 (Y0 + \u03b4)\u2212 \u03c83 (Y0 \u2212 \u03b4) = uei\u03b7\n[\nei\u03ba\u03c81 (Y0) + \u03c84 (Y0)\n]\n, (B5)\n\u03c84 (Y0 + \u03b4)\u2212 \u03c84 (Y0 \u2212 \u03b4) = 0, (B6)\nwhere u = v2a\u03d5\n2(0)U\/vLc. Using these matching conditions, we find that the wavevectors are given by solutions of\n19\n\u22125.0 \u22124.0 \u22123.0 \u22122.0 \u22121.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\nE\/(piv\/L)\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\nIm\npu\nrit\ny \nSt\nre\nng\nth\n u\nFIG. 10: Position of energy levels as a function of the strength of a potential on an A atomic site in the presence of degeneracy\nbreaking due to off-diagonal boundary conditions \u03bem = pi\/8. The position of the impurity is Y0 = 0.125L (potential is a quarter\nof the way from the centre of the nanotube to the end), and other parameter values are \u03ba = 2pi\/3, \u03b7 = pi\/6, \u03bep = \u03a5p = \u03a5m = 0.\nthe following equation:\n0 = sin (qL+ s\u03a5p + \u03bem) sin (qL+ s\u03a5p \u2212 \u03bem)\n\u2212u\n2\nsin (qL+ s\u03a5p \u2212 \u03bem) [s cos (qL+ s\u03a5p + \u03bem) + sin (\u03ba+ \u03b7 \u2212 s\u03a5m \u2212 \u03bep + 2qY0)]\n\u2212u\n2\nsin (qL+ s\u03a5p + \u03bem) [s cos (qL+ s\u03a5p \u2212 \u03bem)\u2212 sin (\u03ba+ \u03b7 + s\u03a5m \u2212 \u03bep \u2212 2qY0)] . (B7)\nIn the degenerate case, \u03bem = 0, expansion of this equation for weak potential strength up to linear in u recovers\nthe results of the degenerate perturbation theory Eq. (31). Moreover, for arbitrary potential strength and \u03bem = 0,\nsin (qL+ s\u03a5p) is always a common factor of Eq. (B7), meaning that half of the levels suffer no energy shift in the\npresence of an impurity for degeneracy preserving boundary conditions. Here we are interested in the non-degenerate\ncase where the degeneracy has already been lifted by the boundary conditions at y = \u00b1L\/2. In the limit u = 0,\nthe first term in Eq. (B7) reproduces the results for a clean nanotube, Eqs. (25) and (26), and we now label these\nwavevectors as q\n(0)\n1 and q\n(0)\n2 , respectively. The angle \u03bem breaks degeneracy, q\n(0)\n2 \u2212 q(0)1 = 2\u03bem\/L for p2 = p1. Now we\nwill present a perturbative result for weak potential strength obtained by expanding Eq. (B7) up to linear in u with\n\u03bem 6= 0:\nq1 \u2248 q(0)1 +\nsu\n2L\n[\n1 + s(\u22121)p1 sin\n(\n\u03ba+ \u03b7 \u2212 s\u03a5m \u2212 \u03bep + 2q(0)1 Y0\n)]\n, (B8)\nq2 \u2248 q(0)2 +\nsu\n2L\n[\n1\u2212 s(\u22121)p2 sin\n(\n\u03ba+ \u03b7 + s\u03a5m \u2212 \u03bep \u2212 2q(0)2 Y0\n)]\n. (B9)\nFor simplicity we set p2 = p1 \u2261 p in order to show that the impurity potential may enhance or reduce the spacing\nbetween adjacent levels:\nq2 \u2212 q1 = 2\u03bem\nL\n\u2212 u\nL\n(\u22121)p cos\n(\ns\u03a5m \u2212 2 [pip\u2212 s\u03a5p] Y0\nL\n)\nsin\n(\n\u03ba+ \u03b7 \u2212 \u03bep \u2212 2\u03bemY0\nL\n)\n. (B10)\nFig. 10 shows the evolution of energy levels near E = 0 as a function of the strength of the potential found by solving\nEq. (B7) numerically. In this example, there is degeneracy breaking in the clean tube due to the boundary conditions,\n\u03bem = pi\/8. In a similar way to the degenerate case, one of the levels in each nearly degenerate pair does not move\nvery much as a function of impurity strength, while its partner suffers a shift that oscillates from pair to pair as a\nfunction of energy (because of the non-zero position of the impurity Y0 with respect to the centre of the tube). Some\n20\nlevels are brought closer together by the presence of the impurity potential, some appear not to move, whilst others\nare split further apart.\n[1] R. Saito, G. Dresselhaus, and M. S.
