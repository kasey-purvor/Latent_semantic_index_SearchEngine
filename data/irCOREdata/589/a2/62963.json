That is,\nportrayal of climate change in tabloid newspapers contradicts the conclusions of\nthe fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment (IPCC\n2007). Is it healthy to have the scientific consensus challenged so frequently? But\nshould we worry about systematic misrepresentation of scientific consensus? We\nbelieve the answer to both of these questions is yes. To present regular updates on\nclimate change issues in the popular press is important because the changes in\nbehaviour needed to achieve substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions\nrequire a broad understanding of the basic facts. However, if the majority of\nreaders receive misleading information, it will be difficult to achieve the level of\npublic understanding necessary to make such reductions needed to avoid\ndangerous climate change (Schellnhuber et al 2006 and references therein).\nBoykoff and Mansfield (2008) identify a gulf in presentation of the scientific\nfacts and their interpretation on the subject of \u2018global warming\u2019 in tabloid\nnewspapers, when compared to the scientific consensus. What is really sobering is\nthe huge circulation of these papers (see table 1 of Boykoff and Mansfield\u2014many\nmillions per day); even the most important \u2018landmark\u2019 research papers very rarely\nachieve five hundred plus citations. We find it heartening, therefore, that the area\nof climate change research does at least have the umbrella of the IPCC. This\nprovides an additional channel through which current research associated with the\neffects of burning fossil fuels can be presented, and in our personal experience at\nleast, we have found the non-tabloid UK newspapers to report accurately any\nIPCC statements. As this perspective article is being written, the UK (and\nworldwide) is facing almost unprecedented increases in the cost of petrol and\ndiesel, and with the transport sector lobbying hard for tax incentives\/rebates to\nreduce fuel costs. In the middle of this, some government ministers are suggesting\nthat from the climate change angle, lower dependence on fossil fuels (forced on\nthe population by such higher prices) might be a good thing. But their voices are\ndrowned by other ministers saying that such an approach is deeply unpopular with\nthe electorate\u2014to what extent, therefore, is the tabloid press responsible for the\nlack of urgency related to potential future damage to the planet?\nHow else are people informed about the climate change debate? Aside from\nTV and radio, popular science books are usually a good source of information.\nHowever a viewing of the environmental sciences department in any bookshop at\npresent will reveal how remarkably polarized the climate change debate is\nbecoming. Some books have very alarming titles; for instance Pearce (2007) is\ntitled \u2018The Last Generation: How Nature will take her Revenge for Climate\nChange\u2019. Meanwhile other books are appearing with titles suggesting that the\nentire issue is given far too much emphasis, is used as a means for politicians to\nkeep society fearful (and presumably, therefore, more controllable), or present a\nview that the IPCC system is scientifically deeply flawed. Examples of these\ninclude Spencer (2008) titled \u2018Climate Confusion: How Global Warming\nHysteria Leads to Bad Science, Pandering Politicians and Misguided Policies that\n1748-9326\/08\/021001+04$30.00 1 \u00a9 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 021001 Perspective\nHurt the Poor\u2019, Booker and North (2007) titled \u2018Scared to Death: From BSE to\nGlobal Warming: Why Scares are Costing us the Earth\u2019 and two books by\nMichaels\u2014Michaels (2004) \u2018Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global\nWarming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media\u2019 and Michaels (2005)\n\u2018Shattered Consensus: The True state of Global Warming\u2019. Both polarized views\ncould be argued as detrimental to addressing possible dangerous climate change.\nThe first argument (i.e. \u2018we are doomed\u2019) gives the impression that climate\nchange is so serious, and possibly unstoppable in the immediate future, that this\ncould lead readers to decide there is nothing that can be achieved on an individual\nbasis\u2013\u2013and yet any measure to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse concentrations\nwill require changed behaviour regarding fossil fuel usage at the individual level.\nOn the other hand, simply to ignore the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric\ngreenhouse gas concentrations on the climate system could lead the planet in to a\nhighly undesirable \u2018dangerous\u2019 state, and one that is potentially difficult or\nimpossible to reverse in reasonable timescales. Fortunately there are some books\non the subject of climate change that do present the science without bias, such as\n\u2018Global Warming\u2019 by Houghton (2004).\nOne new book of particular interest is that of Nigel Lawson, former\nChancellor, whose recent publication on climate change (Lawson 2008) is titled\n\u2018An Appeal to Reason: A Cool Look at Global Warming\u2019. Lawson (2008)\ncontains a range of very interesting and interlinked strands regarding the climate\nchange debate. As with many books discussing technical matters, it is always of\ninterest to first check the citations, and here it is comprehensive, up-to-date and\ncertainly does not initially appear to be selective (this is also true of the two books\nby Michaels). This therefore creates what seems like a paradox. Given that so\nmany of the key papers cited by Lawson (2008) form the backbone of current\nunderstanding of climate change, and many researchers quote these as reasons for\nconcern regarding global warming, how is it that this book instead, concludes (see\nthe dust cover) \u2018. . . the conventional wisdom on the subject is suspect on a number\nof grounds; . . . global warming is not the devastating threat to the planet it is\nwidely alleged to be\u2019?\nWhat is the overall feeling after reading some of Lawson (2008)? Well first\nand foremost, we believe that although the use of literature is impressive, there\nappears to be a deliberate search for the remaining scientific uncertainty (i.e.\nissues freely acknowledged by climate change scientists as requiring refinement,\nbut used in this book as a reason to doubt the entire scientific debate about global\nwarming). On this basis, it is tempting therefore to just ignore this contribution to\nthe debate, but a more positive approach is to re-address these uncertainties, and\nin the process generate more concise scientific understanding and presentation.\nTop of this list would be Lawson\u2019s key argument that global warming has stalled\nbetween the year 2001 and 2007\u2014\u2018there has been no further global warming\nsince the turn of the century . . . which has occurred at a time when global CO2\nemissions have been rising faster than ever\u2019. Lawson then cites, correctly, Smith\net al (2007) but who in fact point out that this is almost certainly due to internal\nvariability and we may expect more warming from year 2009 onwards. Lawson\nconcludes that such a \u2018resumption of warming\u2019 may or may not occur. In our\nview the climate modelling community should work hard to revisit and extend the\nwork of Smith et al (2007), possibly applying their technique to multiple climate\nmodels. In parallel there is a desperate need for better explanation by researchers\nthat, even against a background warming trend, natural variability will mean that\non a year-to-year basis, warming will not necessarily be monotonic. Some of\nLawson\u2019s other arguments can be more readily rebutted. Two issues he presents\nare that trends in global temperature could be a function of varying sunspot\nactivity, and that the global warming measured during the second half of the 20th\nCentury could be a consequence of urbanization around measurement stations\n(the \u2018heat island\u2019 effect). Sloan and Wolfendale (2008) and Parker (2006) provide\n2\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 021001 Perspective\nhighly detailed and convincing reasons why, respectively, these two arguments\ncannot explain the warming trend seen in measurements during the last fifty\nyears\u2014these two papers require more extensive circulation. Lawson attacks the\nIPCC panel as changing from a \u2018fact-finding and analytical exercise\u2019 in to\n\u2018something more like a politically correct alarmist pressure group\u2019. This is\nparticularly unfortunate and is not consistent with the facts. For example Stott et\nal (2000), using statistical \u2018detection and attribution\u2019 analyses, utilized the spatial\npatterns observable in the temperature record to tease apart natural oscillations\nfrom those caused by human adjustments to atmospheric composition. This\nunderpinned in part the statement in the 3rd IPCC Assessment (IPCC 2001) that\n\u2018There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the\nlast 50 years is attributable to human activities\u2019. It should be noted that all such\nanalyses require disproving of the null hypthoesis (i.e. humans have no influence),\nand to a very high level of statistical confidence. In other words, the IPCC report\ndepends heavily on research scientists whose starting point is actually that higher\nlevels of greenhouse gas concentrations (most notably CO2) have had no effect on\nsurface temperatures, unless there is significant evidence to the contrary.\nAt some points, Lawson cannot be taken seriously. He points out (correctly)\nthat CO2 is one of the greenhouse gases without which life would be unable to\nsurvive. However, this is then used to state that \u2018to describe the carbon dioxide in\nthe atmosphere as pollution is as absurd as it would be to describe the clouds as\npollution\u2019. In fact most pollutants of the atmosphere are emitted from\nanthropogenic activity and through natural processes. The gases become\npollutants by exceeding thresholds above which damage occurs\u2014these basic\nprinciples are widely accepted in the scientific community. Hence there is still the\nrequirement to explain in very general terms the role of near-stable (at century\ntimescales) pre-industrial atmospheric CO2 concentrations in sustaining life\n(along with the other greenhouse gas concentrations), but how much higher values\nof CO2 could cause dangerous perturbation to the climate system.\nBoykoff and Mansfield (2008) provide a valuable insight in to how climate\nchange is presented in the media. As the general consensus among climate\nresearch scientists is that to avoid \u2018dangerous\u2019 climate change there is a\nrequirement to make very large reductions in emissions and soon, then this will be\npolitically difficult to achieve against such a backdrop of such press reporting\ndenying the IPCC message. We have also used this perspective article to consider\nhow the debate over climate change (as induced through anthropogenic\nemissions) is presented through popular science books. In some ways this is\nequally worrying\u2014how is it that such polarized views can be presented in books\nfrequently citing the same research papers? With significant public funds placed\nin climate change research, it might be expected that the public deserve more\ndefinitive answers. So the main question here is whether (a) there remains\nmassive uncertainty in how raised atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations\nwill manifest themselves through changes to future climates, or, (b) is there\nselective interpretation of key research papers (and indeed the IPCC report). If the\nanswer is (b)\u2014and that is consistent with the evidence\u2014then each scientific issue\nraised by the sceptics should be addressed. There are important steps in this\ndirection. For example the Royal Society has on its web site specific answers to\nseveral of the commonly used misleading arguments. See\nhttp:\/\/royalsociety.org\/downloaddoc.asp?id=1630 a web page entitled \u2018Facts and\nfictions about climate change\u2019.\nAs governments struggle to balance issues of economic development, the\nubiquitous use of fossil fuels, and the need for very large reductions in emissions\nto ultimately stabilise the climate at safe levels, then it is essential that those\ninvolved in climate change research keep a careful note of the portrayal of their\nresearch in the media. Boykoff and Mansfield (2008) (and citations therein) make\nan important contribution to this process. Ultimately, of course, (for predictions\ncorresponding to different prescribed emissions scenarios) we are working with\n3\nEnviron. Res. Lett. 3 (2008) 021001 Perspective\nan issue embedded in fundamental science. If newspapers and books take a\nsceptical angle, and through this force further reductions in uncertainty bounds\nsurrounding available scientific understanding, then such reporting will have\nplayed a useful role, even if ultimately shown to be incorrect. But such refinement\nhas to happen quickly-\u2014if a global consensus emerges, unchallenged, that\nclimate change issues are being vastly overplayed (or worse are almost some form\nof hoax) then we could be \u2018sleep walking\u2019 towards eventual climatic disaster as a\nconsequence of a \u2018business as usual\u2019 attitude to emissions.\nWe believe the current debate to be vital. But ultimately, society requires a\nbalanced presentation of the facts. It is unreasonable to expect the tabloid media\nto avoid oversimplification and sensational comments, but it is reasonable and\nnecessary in support of the political process to present a balanced view, and to\navoid systematic misrepresentation of the science in either direction. We believe\nthe IPCC goes a long way towards achieving this\u2014but there is still much to do.\nReferences\nBooker B and North R 2007 Scared to Death.
