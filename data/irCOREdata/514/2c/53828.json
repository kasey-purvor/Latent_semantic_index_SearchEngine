Modern geological mapping has \ninvolved bringing together a range of digital datasets and the move towards a digital \nmapping workflow. The multidisciplinary work is integrating existing British \nGeological Survey map data holdings, geochemical information (G-Base), borehole \nrecords, seismic data, digital elevation models, aerial photography interpretations and \n3D modelling techniques with traditional field based geological surveying. The \nNEXTMap elevation model is a key dataset used extensively throughout the mapping \nworkflow.  \n \nThis paper focuses on the contribution that NEXTMap has made to the digital \nmapping workflow, including the processing techniques used for enhancing the \ndataset for geological feature collection. It also briefly covers its use within the digital \nfield data capture system and for the production of three dimensional geological \nmodels. \n \nStudy area \n \nThe Vale of York is a broad area of low lying and generally gently undulating land in \nthe north east of England constrained between the Yorkshire Wolds and Howardian \nHills to the east and the Pennines to the west (Figure 1). The bedrock geology in the \nVale consists of Triassic sandstones and mudstones bounded by Jurassic and \nCretaceous rocks to the east with Permian and Carboniferous rocks to the west \n(Figure 2).  Overlying the bedrock geology there is a varied cover of superficial \ndeposits consisting of glacial till, outwash sands and gravels, glaciolacustrine clay, \npeat and alluvium (Figure 3). Their distribution is strongly influenced by the advance \nand retreat of ice during the Devensian glaciation. Detailed descriptions of the \ngeology of the Vale of York and surrounding areas can be found in Fox-Strangways \n(1884), Gaunt (1981, 1994), Powell et al. (1992), Cooper and Burgess (1993) and \nCooper and Gibson (2003). \n \nTerrain Modeling for Geological Applications \n \nIn temperate environments such as the United Kingdom, extensive vegetation cover \nand soil development results in little exposure of the underlying geology. Geological \nmapping relies on using the interpretation of landform features to tie together \ninformation obtained from exposures, field brash and auger holes. Traditionally these \nfeatures are identified in the field or from hardcopy air photos using a stereoscope. \nHowever, both these methods can be time consuming and the interpretation of air \nphotos can be difficult due to inherent distortions and scale variations present within \nthe imagery. Modern methods such as digital stereo air photo interpretation and the \nuse of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are the two main remote sensing techniques \nthat can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the landform feature capture process. \n \nElevation models have been used for some time as a useful tool for regional and local \ngeological applications (Onorati et al. 1992; Pike, 1992; Bonham-Carter, 1994) and \nlandform mapping (Smith and Clark, 2005). Focused studies have made use of aerial \nphotography or LiDAR derived models, but at a relatively high cost, with contour \nderived models being applied for regional applications. With the availability of \nNEXTMap, elevation models have become routinely used for geological applications \nwithin the British Geological Survey (Hall et al. 2004; Bradwell et al. 2007) and more \nwidely (Smith et al. 2006). The combination of high resolution and national coverage \nis ideally suited to geological mapping and modelling applications. \n \nThe NEXTMap dataset for England and Wales was collected by InterMap \ntechnologies between 2002 and 2003 using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar \n(INSAR), producing a 5m post spacing DEM having a quoted vertical accuracy of \n1.0m Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Type 2 data (Intermap Technologies, \n2007). Two main elevation models make up the dataset, these are the Digital Surface \nModel (DSM) and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). The DSM represents the \nunedited model. The DTM has undergone editing to remove cultural features and \nsmaller areas of trees, embankments have been enhanced and the model has been \nmodified to make it hydrologically correct for drainage.  \n \nQuaternary Evolution of the Vale of York  \n \nThe geological evolution of the Vale of York during the Quaternary produced a \ndistinctive range of sediments and landforms that characterise the present day area \n(Cooper and Burgess, 1993; Gaunt, 1994).  The superficial deposits present in the \nVale of York are largely a result of the last Devensian glaciation between about \n115 000 and 10 000 years ago, when ice covered most of northern Britain (Cooper \nand Gibson, 2003). The advance of Vale of York ice and its subsequent retreat created \nan assemblage of ice contact, ice-marginal and pro-glacial deposits. The main \nmorphological features can be seen in the NEXTMap DTM (Figure 4). \n \nThe Pennines valleys were glaciated as far south as Leeds and a tongue of ice \noccupied the Vale of York advancing as far south as the Escrick Moraine (Figure 5a). \nAt the same time, the North Sea ice advanced to Norfolk blocking the drainage out \nthrough the Humber gap. In front of the ice, fluvio-glacial outwash deposits and pro-\nglacial lake deposits were formed in the dammed pre-glacial valley system.  \n \nAs the ice advanced to the Devensian maximum, forming the Escrick Moraine, it \noverrode many of the pro-glacial deposits. The ice front then retreated progressively \nnorthwards with intervening still-stands depositing the Crockey Hill Esker (Figure \n5a), the York Moraine (Figure 5b) and the Flaxby-Tollerton Moraine (Figure 5c) \n(Cooper and Burgess, 1993). The York and Flaxby-Tollerton moraines represent still-\nstands in the ice margin where the supply of sediment-laden ice was in equilibrium \nwith the degree of melting or wasting.  \n \nThe vast amounts of meltwater draining from the ice-sheet formed sub-glacial \ndrainage systems that commonly became choked with sand and gravel. Upon melting \nof this ice-sheet, these choked drainage systems were left as ridges (eskers) of \npartially disturbed deposits. Where the drainage emerged from the ice-sheet (at the \nsides or in front) it commonly deposited terraces or fans of sand and gravel. Where \nthe drainage disgorged into glacial lakes, fans of sand and gravel formed; these have \nan upper surface approximating to the glacial lake water level. Some of these fans \nwere subsequently buried by glacio-lacustrine deposits including laminated clay. \nThree separate glacial lakes were formed, the largest pro-glacial lake (Humber pro-\nglacial lake) being in front of the Escrick Moraine, another between the York and \nEscrick moraines and another to the north of the York moraine; the deposits formed in \nthese lakes are, from south to north, the Hemingbrough, Elvington and Alne \nglaciolacustrine formations (Figure 6).  \n \nAfter the Devensian glaciation, the ice retreated from the Humber Gap and the pro-\nglacial lake of the Vale of York drained eastwards into the North Sea. Extensive sand \ndeposits were washed out across the floor of the recently drained lake and spreads of \nsand with a little gravel were formed. As these deposits dried and the drainage \nbecame established, exposed sand deposits were blown around the newly emerged \nlake bed forming subdued dunes of blown sand. Much of the drainage followed its \nprevious course into the Vale such as around the front of the Escrick Moraine cutting \ninto the glacial till, the glaciofluvial outwash terraces and the associated glacial lake \ndeposits (Figure 6) (Cooper and Gibson, 2003).  \n \nNEXTMap and Superficial Mapping \n \nThe glacial deposits within the vale of York are extensive and NEXTMap has made \nan import contribution to the understanding of lake-bottom elevations, the recognition \nof sand bodies resting on lake deposits and identifying details within morainic and \nalluvial complexes.  \n \nThe BGS produces geological linework of Great Britain at a number of scales in \ndigital and hardcopy format and in Superficial and Bedrock versions. Geological \nmapping typically takes place at 1:10k or 1:20k and this linework is then produced in \n1:50000, 1:250000 and 1:625000 versions with the appropriate generalisations. These \ndatasets are named DiGMap GB-50, 250 and 625, with DiGMap GB50 being the \nstandard scale of the national sheet based printed maps. \n \nTo allow comparison with the current DiGMap GB-50 scale geological line work, the \nNEXTMap data is processed to enhance the topographic information held within the \ndataset. A number of steps are involved with this enhancement process, which is \nundertaken in the ArcMap environment. Firstly the terrain model is artificially lit \nusing the Spatial Analyst extension. This artificial lighting effect, or shaded relief, \ngives the appearance of sunlight illuminating the model, creating shadows and \nhighlights. The sun azimuth and elevation can be modified to enhance landform \nfeatures with a particular orientation. A second semi-transparent copy of the \nNEXTMap dataset is superimposed above the shaded relief and colour ramped \naccording to elevation, producing a combined shaded and colour ramped image. The \npre-revision linework can then be checked against the landforms displayed in the hill-\nshaded and colour ramped image. The features are typically subtle and individual \ncolour ramp intervals of 10-15cm were found to be most effective in identifying \nfeatures. Fieldwork was then targeted in areas where there was found to be a \ndiscrepancy between the landform features and the existing linework. It was \nestablished that the DSM model was more useful than then DTM as the algorithm \nused to remove trees and culture features from the DSM to produce the DTM was \nfound to also remove subtle landform features. \n \nThe correspondence between the existing geological line work and the NEXTMap \nDSM model is shown in Figures 7 and 8; numerous features are clearly identifiable. \nThe Crockey Hill Esker is visible as an elongated ridge aligned north-south; sand and \ngravel deposits form several raised areas and the Escrick Moraine in the southern part \nof the image is striking (Figure 7). Localised ponding caused by the moraine \nrestricting draining in this part of the Vale has resulted in an area of alluvium in the \nlow lying areas behind the ridge. Figure 8 shows the area of high ground formed by \nthe central part of the Escrick moraine. A relict drainage channel can be identified, \nwhich is thought to represent drainage through the moraine prior to the break through \nby the River Derwent. The Derwent, with is its associated floodplain deposits, can be \nseen in the centre of the image. Some areas show a clear discrepancy between the \nlandform features present on the NEXTMap DSM and the existing mapping for the \nnorthern extent of the Escrick Moraine. In Figure 9, a possible river terrace, not \npresent on existing mapping, can be identified on the Western bank of the Derwent; \nthere are also areas where the morainic till and the glaciofluvial deposits could be \nextended. \n \nThe NEXTMap dataset has considerable advantages over contour derived models in \nthe low relief areas of the Vale of York. The wide spacing of contours was found to \nresult in interpolation artefacts and the smoothing of subtle features. As the \nNEXTMap model is based on a radar signal collected at regular intervals along the \nground surface, the model is particularly useful for the interpretation of superficial \ndeposits in river floodplains and other low relief areas.   \n \nNEXTMap and Bedrock Mapping \n \nAn extensive outcrop of Jurassic and Cretaceous strata forms the eastern limit to the \nVale of York and the prominent topographic feature of the Yorkshire Wolds. This \narea of higher ground is relatively well featured compared to the superficial deposit \ncovered lower ground The NEXTMap dataset was used for a number of aspects of \nbedrock mapping. Prior to fieldwork, a study of the DSM allowed breaks in slope to \nbe recognised and interpreted in the context of the local geological succession. \nDiscrepancies between existing geological mapping and the NEXTMap interpretation \nwere targeted and prioritised for subsequent fieldwork, resulting in a more effective \nuse of field resources. \n \nIn order to provide a rapid initial appraisal of the existing linework techniques were \ndeveloped to automatically extract the main landscape features, as described by Ford \n(2007). This \u2018synthetic feature mapping\u2019 process was carried out with ArcMap using \nthe Spatial Analyst extension; the method is outlined in Figure 10. Firstly the DSM \nwas classified by slope angle (Figure 10a). The slope angle map was then classified; \nthis produced the second derivative of the DSM and highlights areas of dissimilar \nslope angle, effectively showing breaks of slope (Figure 10b). Symmetrical crest and \nvalley features were defined by an appraisal of slope facing direction. By combining \nthese derived maps and overlaying existing geological linework, it is possible to \nidentify discrepancies between landscape features shown on the DSM and existing \nmapping (Figure 10c). Figure 10c shows the Penarth group following closely the \nrelatively steeper sloping ground illustrated by the darker shading. However, as the \nunit follows the hillside northwards the unit is shown to be no longer constrained by \nthe steeper ground (as shown by white arrow) and moves up the slope to the flatter \nground at the top of the hill. This appears to be wrong and it is more likely that this \nunits would remain on the steeper ground. Detailed contour and elevation information \nwere not available at the time of the original survey and would make a contribution to \nthe inaccuracies identified. Positioning geological boundaries would be difficult in \nareas where there was little outcrop and subtle landform features. Cultural and \nvegetation features are also brought out by synthetic feature mapping approach, as the \nDSM was used, but it was found to be relatively straightforward to separate these \nfrom the landscape features by consulting topographic maps and aerial photography. \nResults using the DTM, were not as favourable as using the DSM as filtering \napproach used to generate the DSM from the DTM appears to \u201cerode\u201d some of the \nsubtle topographic features. \n \nLandslides exist on a number of the steeper slopes formed by the Penarth Group, \nRedcar Mudstone Formation, Ampthill and Oxford clay formations and the \nCretaceous chalks. The existing geological map for York does not show the location \nor extent of these landslides because they were not mapped during the 1880\u2019s survey, \nbeing noted with a comment only on the field maps. With an increasing awareness of \ngeological hazards, the accurate mapping and understand of mass movement deposits \nhas become increasingly important. The NEXTMap DSM displayed a marked \ncontrast in surface texture between bedrock areas subject to landslide activity and \nareas with more stable slopes. The most effective processing techniques were the \ngeneration of shaded relief and slope images.  An example of the undulating texture \ncaused by landsliding can be seen in the shaded relief image in Figure 11. The \nresolution of NEXTMap is high enough to identify individual rotated blocks within \nthe landslide complex (Figures 11 and 12). In this way it is possible to not only \nidentify areas of possible landsliding, but to begin to understand the failure \nmechanisms responsible for the movement. \n \nNEXTMap manipulation in the field and 3D modelling using NEXTMap \n \nA digital data capture system is currently being introduced within the British \nGeological Survey as a replacement for paper fieldslips and notebook as a component \npart of the move towards a complete digital mapping workflow (Jordan et al., 2005). \nThe system is based on a customised version of ArcMap running on a ruggedised \ntablet PC with an integrated GPS, allowing the capture of text, polygons and lines and \nform based data (Figure 13). One significant benefit of the system is the ability to \nmanipulate NEXTMap data on a site specific basis, such as adjusting artificial \nshading and colour ramping parameters, according to local topographic variations. \nThe system also includes a \u2018structure contour tool\u2019 for calculating where a geological \nbed will outcrop based on structural measurements. Given the location of an \nobservation point where the angle and direction of dip of the bed are known, and \nassuming the dip is uniform, the tool can calculate an equation for the plane of the \nbed. Where this plan intersects with the ground surface it can be predicted where the \nbed will outcrop. The NEXTMap DTM is used by the tool to provide elevation data \nfor the calculation and allows the calculation to be completed in the field.  \n \nThe British Geological Survey is increasingly producing three dimensional geological \nmodels for geological analysis and for external customers as described by Kessler and \nMathers (2004) and Kessler et al. (2005). The terrain surface is a key input to a 3D \ngeological model, providing the top surface of the geological sequence and an \nelevation from which to hang boreholes. To assist in the geological mapping of the \nYork sheet a geological model was constructed to investigate the superficial deposits \nin York city centre, allowing an appraisal of a large number of boreholes. NEXTMap \ndata provided the surface constraint for the constructed units. The resultant model is \nshown in Figure 14, with the individual units vertically separated.  \n \nConclusions \n \nThe NEXTMap Britain elevation model has provided many opportunities to enhance \nthe geological mapping of bedrock, structure, superficial and artificial deposits and \nhas been successfully integrated into the digital and conventional mapping workflows \nof the Vale of York mapping team.  \n \nA variety of techniques have been applied throughout the mapping process and \nNEXTMap interpretation has made an important contribution to the understanding of \nthe extensive glacial and pro-glacial deposits found in the Vale of York. \n \nNEXTMap has been used to identify landform features that relate to the underlying \ngeology, providing an overview of the landscape and reducing the time needed to map \nout features in the field. Techniques have also been developed to automatically \ngenerate these landform features in areas of well featured bedrock. \n \nThe dataset has also been used to identify areas where landsliding has occurred, for \naccurate mapping of artificial ground and as a key surface for input into 3D geological \nmodels. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThanks are given to Linda Austin, Stuart Egan, Kay McManus and Claire Foster for \nreviewing the manuscript and making constructive comments that have improved the \nwork.
