The majority of these systems use the Chalk aquifer \nas a water source.  A significant proportion of the abstracted water must be returned \nto the aquifer to maintain groundwater levels.  If the ground system is to function \ncorrectly, the temperature of the abstracted groundwater must not be altered \nsignificantly by early thermal breakthrough of the returned water.    Groundwater flow \nwithin the Chalk is predominantly through fractures and these provide the primary \nroute by which thermal breakthrough might take place.  The nature of the fracturing \nand its impact on the thermal transport beneath a proposed site must be understood \nto provide confidence that the ground energy system will function correctly.  Two \ntracer and thermal test methods to determine fracture properties are examined.     \nThe results suggest that the flow in the Chalk is carried by a small number of \nfractures and that careful modelling and interpretation can provide valuable \nconstraints on the frequency of fractures, their spatial pattern and their hydraulic \naperture.  The results highlight difficulties for designing within borehole temperature \nmonitoring systems for fractured aquifer thermal experiments.  \n \n \nMain Text \n \nGround energy systems use the ground and groundwater as a heat \u2018source\u2019 during \nthe heating (Winter) cycle and a heat \u2018sink\u2019 during the cooling (Summer) cycle. \nGround and groundwater temperature is normally equal to the average annual air \ntemperature, making it cooler than the average air temperature during the summer \nand warmer than the average air temperature during the winter.  Ground energy \nsystems usually consist of a ground loop connected to ground source heat pumps \n(GSHPs).  GSHPs operate in a similar way to conventional air sourced systems but \ncapitalise on the fact that the ground temperature is close to that required for space \nheating or cooling.  GSHPs therefore have to do much less work than a conventional \nair sourced system to achieve the required room temperatures and therefore operate \nat much higher efficiencies.  \n \nThere are two primary methods of linking the ground to the GSHP: \u2018closed loop\u2019 and \n\u2018open loop\u2019.  Closed loop systems consist of a number of tubes buried beneath the \nground through which a fluid is circulated.  There is no direct contact between the \nheat conducting fluid and the ground or groundwater.  In the case of open systems, \nthe groundwater is used as the heat conducting fluid and pumps are used to abstract \ngroundwater before passing it through a heat exchanger and \/or a GSHP.  The waste \ngroundwater is then either recharged to the aquifer or disposed to a surface water \nsource.  Open loop systems yield significantly more energy per borehole than closed \nloop systems.  \n \nA common strategy in London has been to install open loop systems that use \ngroundwater from the Chalk aquifer. Recent regulations from the Environment \nAgency in England state that licenses for abstraction from the Chalk are unlikely to \nbe granted for abstractions greater than 0.2 Mega litres\/day (525 gallons per minute) \n(Environment Agency, 2005).  Therefore, for an open loop ground energy system of \nany significant size, the majority of the water abstracted from the aquifer will have to \nbe re-injected to the aquifer.  To avoid high costs for piping and to restrict possible \ninterference with other schemes, reinjection will normally take place within the \nfootprint of the building .   Thus, the injection and abstraction boreholes are normally \nin close proximity (<100 m) to one another and the risk of interference between the \nboreholes is of potential concern. \n  \nThe injected water will be at a different temperature to the aquifer and the interaction \nbetween this water and the aquifer can affect the sustainability of the system in both \nthe short and long term.  This paper is concerned with short term sustainability issues \ncaused by rapid thermal breakthrough due to a small number of fractures connecting \nthe injection and abstraction boreholes.   Identification of the fracture frequency and \napertures of the fractures is an essential requirement for predictive assessment of \nbreakthrough risks. \n \nGeology and hydrogeology of London \nThe central London area falls within the London Basin, an asymmetric syncline in \nCretaceous and Tertiary deposits.  The Basin is faulted in a number of places.  The \nfaulting affects aquifer continuity and the flow of water.  A typical sequence of strata \nat a site can be summarised as, Made Ground, Alluvium & Gravels, London Clay \/ \nLambeth Group, Thanet Sand Formation and the Chalk (Figure 1).  The Chalk is \nlocated at approximately 90m below ground level and forms the main aquifer.  The \nChalk aquifer is typically hydrogeologically linked to the Thanet Sand Formation \nwhich is a fine grained sandstone.  The intact chalk is generally considered to be \nimpermeable (Bloomfield 1995, Macdonald 2001) but fissures and fractures can \nmake the overall rock mass highly permeable.  Water flow can be rapid where \nsignificant fracturing occurs.  \n \n \nFigure 1 Summary of the geology in central London and an open loop \nconfiguration \n \nThe degree of fissuring in the Chalk can be highly variable. The mass permeability of \nthe Chalk typically decreases with depth and it is generally considered, for \nengineering purposes, that almost all the water is yielded by the upper 60\u2013100 m of \nthe chalk.  The Chalk is widely exploited for water abstraction in Central London with \ntypical borehole yields of 15 litres\/second (240 gallons\/minute).  The background \nhydraulic gradient in the Chalk of the London basin is typically 1\/1000 with \n60m \n90m \n160m \nMaximum width (125m) \nOpen section of borehole \nThanet Sand \nLondon clay and \nLambeth group \nGravel\ns \nMade Ground \nChalk Aquifer \nScreened section of borehole \nBuilding \ngroundwater flow in the direction of the central London groundwater depression \n(Environment Agency, 2005). \n \nShort term sustainability \nShort term sustainability problems are caused by short circuiting between the \ninjection and abstraction boreholes.  Short circuiting will primarily be caused by \nfractures within the aquifer through which water can flow at rapid rates.  It is \nconceivable that a single (1mm) fracture could carry the majority of the flow between \nan injection and abstraction borehole, causing rapid thermal interference (potentially \nin a time frame under 48 hours).  This process is illustrated in Figure 2. \n \n \nFigure 2 Thermal breakthrough caused by a single fracture \nIt is our opinion that the issue of short term sustainability and thermal breakthrough in \nfractured aquifers has not been given sufficient attention during the design of open \nloop systems.  As this technology is relatively new in the United Kingdom few data \nhave been published to corroborate this thesis. \n \nThe data presented below (Figure 3) are from an abstraction and injection borehole \nat an operational site in central London.  The data points are for July and August and \nshow the rapid response of the abstraction temperature to the injection temperature.  \nThe peaks in abstraction temperature directly correlate to the injection temperature of \nthe day before, implying that thermal breakthrough is taking place in under 24 hours.  \nThis breakthrough time can only be caused by fracture flow.  In addition, the \nabstraction temperature rises even when injection temperatures are comparatively \nlow, implying that little heat is being lost to the Chalk matrix during transport between \nthe boreholes.  In these cases, as the temperature difference between the injected \nwater and the matrix is as little as 2\u00b0C the water transport time must be too fast for \nthe heat to be absorbed by the matrix.   Over the summer period of approximately 3 \nmonths, the average temperature in the abstraction borehole has increased by 1\u00b0C. \n \n \n \nSingle fracture plane in the Chalk linking the \ninjection and abstraction boreholes \nOpen section of \nborehole \nLimited energy \nexchange between \nthe fracture and the \nrock \n  \n \n \n \n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n22\/06\/2006 02\/07\/2006 12\/07\/2006 22\/07\/2006 01\/08\/2006 11\/08\/2006 21\/08\/2006 31\/08\/2006 10\/09\/2006\nDate\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n (\nD\ne\ng\nre\ne\ns\n C\n)\nAbstraction Temp\nRecharge Temp\n \nFigure 3 Temperature data from an existing open loop system, London \nGeneral approach to designing a system \nSustainability issues should be addressed before the system is installed.  Long term \nsustainability problems can be resolved by ensuring that the energy demands placed \nupon the aquifer are approximately balanced throughout the year.  This can only be \nachieved through dialogue between the building designers, M&E engineers and the \nground energy system designer.   \nShort term sustainability issues are more difficult to resolve as they require prior \nknowledge of the aquifer.  This paper considers a suite of field tests and their \ninterpretation aimed at predicting the thermal transport characteristics at a site.  The \nfield testing regime and interpretation was undertaken at a site located in central \nLondon to assist with the design of a proposed open loop system. \nTesting \n \nThe aim of the testing regime was to provide sufficient data to predict the nature of \nthe thermal transport beneath the site.  The tests conducted were as follows: \n \n\uf0b7 CCTV survey \n\uf0b7 Flow logging \n\uf0b7 Pumping tests \n\uf0b7 Tracer testing \n\uf0b7 Thermal testing \n \nAll these tests require at least one and in some cases two test boreholes to be drilled \nat the site.  If the trials are successful, the boreholes can later be used for the ground \nenergy system.  However, this represents something of a Catch 22.  Test boreholes \nare expensive to install.  This implies that a client is already committed to a ground \nenergy system even though no tests have been undertaken at the site.  However, the \nclient can only finally commit once the tests have been undertaken and an \nassessment of the performance of the aquifer completed. \n \nCCTV survey \n \nA CCTV survey was conducted over the entire length of the boreholes drilled at the \nsite.  A CCTV survey serves two purposes: a method of checking the way in which \nthe borehole has been drilled and cased and as a method of locating likely fractures.  \nAn image from the CCTV survey conducted in one of the boreholes at the site is \nshown in Figure 4.  The image is taken at a depth of approximately 86m and clearly \nshows a fracture plane.   The aperture of the fracture is varied in size but is of the \norder of 2 millimetres.  Although the fracture can be clearly seen, it may not be \nflowing. \n \n \n \nFigure 4 CCTV survey showing a potential fracture in the Chalk (86mbgl) \n \nFlow logging \n \nFlow logging was undertaken in both static and pumped conditions.  A flow log \nmeasures the flow at all points along the depth of the borehole.  Flow rates in the \nborehole increase where fractures occur.  If the increase in flow is fairly regular over \nthe entire depth of the borehole then it can be assumed that many fractures are \ncarrying the flow and the aquifer can be treated for analytical purposes as a \nhomogenous medium.  Conversely, if the flow rate jumps at certain points along the \nlength of the borehole then only a few fractures are likely to contribute to the flow.  \nFigure 5 is the flow log at the site during pumped conditions, at a depth of between \n68 and 98 mbgl.  There is a clear influx horizon where the flow rate increases, at \napproximately 86 mbgl.  This corresponds to the fracture detected at this level by the \nCCTV survey and helps to confirm that this particular fracture is not only flowing but \ncarrying a significant quantity of the flow. \n \n \n \nFigure 5 Results from the flow logging (_s_unpumped conditions; _p_ pumped \nconditions; _r_ recharge) \n \nAlthough CCTV and flow logging have suggested that the majority of the flow to both \nboreholes during pumping is through a single fracture plane, the properties of the \nfracture are not possible to determine using this test alone and the detailed effect of \nother flow contributions at greater depths requires further evaluation. \nPumping tests \nPumping tests are used primarily to prove the flow rate for a borehole.  In addition, \nconstant rate pumping tests enable the transmissivity of the aquifer to be estimated.  \nThe transmissivity calculated from a pumping test in the Chalk is important because \nit provides an indication of whether the aquifer is significantly fractured.  This is \nbecause most of the transmissivity of the Chalk is due to the presence of fissures \nand fractures, so that a high transmissivity is evidence of significant fissuring. \n \nAt the test site in central London the transmissivity was estimated to be between 700 \nm\u00b2\/day and 1000 m\u00b2\/day.  This is significantly above that which would be expected \nfor the chalk in this area (250m\u00b2\/day) (Monkhouse, 1995) implying the presence of a \nsignificant fracture or series of fractures. \n \nTracer and thermal test \nTracer testing offers a method of measuring the velocity of water as it travels \nbetween an injection and abstraction borehole.  The most effective test requires two \nboreholes to be drilled; one injection and one abstraction.  At the injection borehole a \nknown quantity of tracer (in this case fluorescein) is deposited in the borehole.  A \ndetector is placed in the discharge line at the abstraction borehole and the amount of \ntime that the fluorescein takes to travel from the injection borehole to the abstraction \nborehole is measured. This can be used to estimate the velocity of the water which \nallows the transmissivity of the aquifer and a range of possible fracture numbers and \napertures to be deduced. See Barker(1993) for a full description of the method of \ninterpretation. \n \nThe thermal test consists of isolating a section of a borehole (using packers) where \nflow zones were identified (from CCTV and flow metering).    A large volume of water \nis heated at the surface and injected into the isolated section of the borehole before \nbeing withdrawn.  The thermal absorption properties of the aquifer can then, \ntheoretically, be back calculated. \n \n \nThermal and tracer test results and interpretation \n \nTracer test \n \n \nFigure 6.  Tracer test results. \n \nThe results from the tracer test are shown in Figure 6. The spacing between the \ndoublet boreholes is 122 m.  The results show three interesting features.  First a \nclear rapid early breakthrough curve at the abstraction borehole.  The first \nbreakthrough occurs at 65 minutes after start of injection, which is approximately 60 \nminutes after the tracer is first injected to the aquifer (as a result of the delay in \ntransmission down the borehole in the injection pipe).  The second is the apparent \nsecondary breakthroughs at later times.  Closer inspection of the secondary \nbreakthroughs show a periodic pattern with decaying amplitude.   The secondary \nbreakthroughs imply the recycling of the tracer around the injection\/discharge loop.   \nThe third, and somewhat surprising result, is the smoothness of the breakthrough \ncurves.  A fracture network would be expected to give a \u2018noisier\u2019 response and this \nsuggests flow in continuous and relatively uniform planes or channels. \n \nThe formula for the first breakthrough time across a doublet borehole system with \nconstant rate injection\/discharge of Q with no mechanical dispersion and separation \ndistance L in a homogeneous medium is: \nQ\nLb\ntb\n3\n2\uf066\uf070\n\uf03d\n   Eq. 1 \n \nwhere \uf066 is the porosity of an aquifer of thickness b.  For clean fractures we can re-\ninterpret the porosity as unity and the b as the aperture.   The first breakthrough \noccurs about 1hour after initial injection of the tracer to the aquifer (note injection time \nto the aquifer has been adjusted from start of injection at ground surface to account \nfor the injection procedure adopted).   Using equation 1 yields an apparent aperture \nof 5.8mm \n \nA transmissivity of about 1000 m2\/d has been calculated based on the interpretation \nof the head differences between the boreholes during pumping.    To satisfy the \ncombined transmissivity and aperture constraints presented by the pumping and \ntracer tests implies that about 4 equal fractures of approximately 1.5mm would yield \nthe appropriate breakthrough.  This calculation assumes that the hydraulic aperture \nand the mechanical aperture for the fractures are the same.   Whilst this condition is \nnot confirmed, it has been adopted as an appropriate initial working hypothesis for \nthe modelling interpretation. \n \nThis calculation also assumes that the fractures are planar rather than channelled \nand it assumes that all the flow is through the upper horizon.  To test these \nassumptions it is necessary to do more than simply investigate the first breakthrough \ntime, it is necessary to model the full breakthrough curve.   This has been carried out \nusing a particle tracking model to model conservative tracer breakthrough to the \ndischarge borehole in steady-state flow conditions (analytically modelled) around a \ndoublet borehole in an infinite aquifer.  The adoption of a steady-state approximation \nfor the flow geometry should be sufficiently accurate given the low storage coefficient \nfor confined fractured chalks and the lateral extent of the chalk. \n \nBreakthrough curve analysis was undertaken assuming no rock matrix diffusion.  \nDispersion, the potential for flow loss down the borehole to the deeper flow horizons \nand recycling of the fluorescein was allowed.   The modelled properties obtain a good \ncalibration (Figure 7) assuming that there is a flow loss of about 30% to the lower \nhorizons of the injection well (this is consistent with the flow data shown earlier in \nFigure 5.   The calibrated model presents the following features: \n \n1. The shape of the first breakthrough curve is well matched to the observation \ndata. \n2. The timing and amplitude of the secondary breakthrough curves is well \nmatched to the observation data. \n3. The decay of the secondary breakthrough curves is only slightly lower than \nthe decay rate observed in the actual tracer response but the total loss of \ntracer is less than indicated in the observations.    \n \nThe results indicate that the assumption of Darcian flow in homogeneous planar \nfractures is a good approximation of the real conditions for this particular site.  The \nrequired magnitude of the longitudinal dispersivities indicates that the fracture \napertures show some heterogeneity but that this is most likely not derived by large \nscale channelling features. The results also indicate that the tracer lost to the lower \nborehole section does not reach the discharge borehole during the first 7 hour period \nof the tracer test.  Feature 3 suggests a further net loss of material that is not \nidentified by the model.   During calibration it was not possible to increase the \ndownflow loss of 30 percent further without underestimating the magnitude of the first \nbreakthrough peak.   Two possible causes for this are rock matrix diffusion and \npossible regional scale heterogeneity increasing the lengths of some flow paths \nbetween the boreholes during pumping.  \n \n \n0.00\n50.00\n100.00\n150.00\n200.00\n250.00\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\nTime since injection commenced (hours)\nF\nlu\no\nre\ns\nc\ne\nin\n C\no\nn\nc\ne\nn\ntr\na\nti\no\nn\n (\np\np\nb\n)\nObservations\nModelled (particle tracking)\n  \n \nFigure 7.   Calibrated versus observed breakthrough tracer concentrations  at \nthe outlet of the doublet discharge borehole. \n \n \nThe results of the modelling indicate that about 70% of the injected water is travelling \nthrough the fractures in the upper section of the Chalk.  The model suggests a total \naperture of 7 mm and, therefore, assuming that 70% of the transmissivity (ie 666 \nm2\/d) is provided by the upper section and uniform fracture properties, then roughly 7 \nfractures of aperture 1.1mm are required to meet both the transmissivity and fracture \nporosity constraints.    This figure is rather different from the first breakthrough time \nanalysis (ignoring the full tracer response) and will have the affect of increasing the \ntime to thermal breakthrough under the operation of the doublet borehole for thermal \nenergy storage.  \n \nTypical values for rock matrix diffusion at fracture walls for limestone have been \nestimated in a study by  Greswell et al. (1998) to be around 3 x 10-6 m2\/d.  Based on \nthis value, it is possible to estimate the maximum amount of tracer that could be lost \nby this process over the duration of the test if 7 fractures are assumed.  When \ncalculated this amounts to about 28 percent of the injected volume after 7 hours.    A \nfigure of 30 percent is needed to explain the apparent loss and therefore rock matrix \ndiffusion could provide a possible explanation for the enhanced decay.    \n \nWhilst each of these results must be considered cautiously, the tracer test has \nprovided potentially very useful information for the determination of the physical \nsystem that controls thermal breakthrough.   \n \n \nThermal test \n \nThermal testing between packers was carried out on the upper and lower sections of \nthe borehole but only useful results were obtained for the lower section and these are \nshown in Figure 8.    The borehole diameter was oversized in the upper part of the \nchalk making it impossible to locate and fix the packers to carry out a test.   Five \ncubic metres of warm (35oC) water was injected at 5 litres per second into a 3.66m \npackered section of the borehole over a period of twenty minutes.  The packered \nsection was then pumped at 5 litres per second to recover the injected water.   \nTemperatures were monitored at 30 second intervals with thermistors at the top \nmiddle and lower sections of the borehole to observe the heat loss into the aquifer \nand to examine the form of the response to establish whether the expected thermal \nproperties for the chalk are consistent with the observations. \n4\n8\n12\n16\n20\n24\n28\n32\n36\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500\nTime (seconds)\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n (\no\nC\n)\n-16\n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n12\n16\nF\nlo\nw\n (\nl\/\ns\n)\nTransducer\nBottom\nMiddle\nTop\nAverage \nFlow\n \nFigure 8   Field observations during the thermal energy injection withdrawal \ntests.   \n \nThe results for the 3 thermistors are intriguing in so far as they show remarkably \ndifferent magnitudes of response.  The highest temperatures are recorded in the mid \nsection while the lowest are recorded at the lower section with the upper section \nshowing a rise in temperature intermediate between the other two.    The heated \nwater was injected at the mid point of the packered section.  In addition, the \ntemperatures only gradually increase towards the injected water temperatures during \nthe test and on cessation and reversal of flow, they show a gradual response to the \nreversal that is rather different from the typical recovery shape as would be expected \nfor simple heat injection and withdrawal in a single fracture.   The gradual rise in \ntemperature cannot be explained by thermal losses in the injection pipe and as there \nis apparently little mixing in the open section of the packered borehole and the \nvolume of the open section is much smaller than the injected volume, it cannot be \nexplained by manifold type mixing.   Another explanation is required to resolve the \napparent thermal behaviour of the experiment. \n \nFigure 9 shows the arrangement of the packers, pipework and the pumps in the \nborehole.    This figure provides the clues to the processes controlling the form of the \ntemperature observations.    If it is assumed that flow is to one or a few localised \nfractures below the inlet to the pump, then the water in the borehole  between the \npackers will be effectively stationary other than between the outflow from the pump \nand the fractures.  It is important to note that this interpretation ignores local \nthermally driven flow cells, which may play a role in determining the temperature \ndistribution within the packered section.    The pipework transmitting the inflow down \nto the midpoint of the packered section permits heat to be transmitted by thermal \nconduction to the stationary water in the annular space surrounding it.   Thus, during \ninjection the upper half of the packered section will be heated.   As the pump has a \nlarger diameter than the pipework above and because heat transmission of metals is \nhigh relative to water (and the annular space around the pump is smaller), the water \nin the annular space around the pump will be heated more quickly than the water \nabove the pump, leading to higher temperature rises.   At the base of the packered \nsection, a similar heat source is not present and the temperature rises will therefore \nbe much lower.   To test whether the concepts identified here explain the results, a \nhighly simplified model (excluding thermal convection in the annular space) was built \nto include the main elements of the borehole as shown in Figure 9.  The thermal \nproperties used are presented in Table 1.    The data used in this Table are taken \nfrom standard values presented in the literature and on the web (The Engineering \nToolBox, 2005)   The modelling results are shown in Figure 10.     \n \n \nFigure 9.

The model failed to reproduce the lower \ntemperature profile suggesting that either a part of the internal construction of the \npacker\/pump system is not properly represented in the model or alternatively there is \na very slow discharge to the aquifer close to the base of the packered section.   \nNeither will have a strong influence on the use of the model results.  \n \n \n3.66m \nThermistor \nPump \nPacker \nChalk \nOpen borehole \nInjection pipe \n0.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\n20.0\n25.0\n30.0\n35.0\n40.0\n0.0 500.0 1000.0 1500.0 2000.0 2500.0\nTime since start of injection (seconds)\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n (\no\nC\n)\nUpper sensor (model)\nMiddle Sensor (model)\nUpper Sensor (observed)\nMiddle Sensor (observed)\nFracture inlet temperature (model)\n \n \nFigure 10.  Modelled versus observed response for the thermal test. \n \nThe thermal modelling analysis carried out here illustrates two rather important points \nand words of caution.  First, the sensitivity of the modelled temperature variations to \nsensor location in the annular space and to the modelled processes taking place that \ndrive heat flow in this region is very large and therefore caution is needed when \ndrawing inferences from the modelling for the interpretation of thermal properties.   \nFor fractured rock masses, the adoption of within packer monitoring is essentially \ninappropriate under these circumstances.  Second, the recovery of the temperature \nin the borehole provides some evidence for the degree of fracturing in the packered \nsection only if the thermal properties of the rock are known.   \n \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500\nTime since start of injection (seconds)\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n a\nt \nth\ne\n p\na\nc\nk\ne\nr \nin\nle\nt\/\no\nu\ntl\ne\nt \n(o\nC\n)\nsingle fracture\ntwo fractures\n \n  \nFigure 11. Modelled results for a single fracture and two fractures. \n \nThe different responses during recovery for one and two fractures is shown in Figure \n11.    There is a marked increase in the thermal losses to the matrix from the two \nfractures compared with the single fracture case, indicating that this test can support \nthe assessment (at least locally to the injection well) of the frequency of fracturing.  \nHowever, for a valid interpretation of the fracture frequency, the modelling does \nrequire a priori knowledge of the rock thermal properties.  Such knowledge does \nappear to be available and the current experiments show that in this case the \nadoption of standard literature values for the thermal properties of the chalk and the \nborehole construction materials yield similar results to those observed .  \nNevertheless, the full results suggest that thermal heating tests are most useful when \nthey are accompanied by a tracer test to acquire an  initial appraisal of the fracture \nfrequency and property data.  Thus, the thermal test does provide a valuable \nconfirmation of the applicability of the literature derived values for thermal \nconductivity and heat capacity once an understanding of the flow geometry is \navailable.  It is also reasonable to infer from the combination of the tracer and \nthermal test results that an adequate understanding of the fracture systems is \nessential to prove the value of a fractured rock site for geothermal energy storage \nand recovery.  Moreover, it appears from the present results that a combination of \ntracer and thermal testing supported by use of existing data on thermal properties for \nmany of the UK rock types is sufficient to provide the required information for \nassessment of both the short term risks and the longer term behaviour of the aquifer \nunder an applied cyclical thermal loading. \n \nConclusions \n \nA suite of tests were undertaken at a site in central London to determine the fracture \nflow in the Chalk.  The results were used to help design an open loop ground energy \nsystem.  The testing identified that a small number of fractures (<10) carried the \nmajority of the flow between the two boreholes.  CCTV and flow logging identified the \napproximate location of some of the fractures.  Tracer testing (fluorescein) proved to \nbe the most successful method of categorising the fractures.   \nTwo methods were used to interpret the results of the tracer testing.  The first method \nused a simple interpretation based on the breakthrough time.  This interpretation \nconcluded that 4 fractures, each of 1.5mm would be a good approximation for the \nflow.  The second interpretation, that modelled the full breakthrough curve, concluded \nthat flow was carried by 7 fractures, each of 1.1mm. \nA thermal test was also devised in an attempt to mimic the actual response of the \nChalk to thermal injection.  However, an interpretation of the results of the test \nshowed that the results were inconclusive.  For a thermal test to provide conclusive \nresults, observations of the integrated thermal outputs during recovery (ie the \ntemperature of the recovered discharge) would be needed.  The results also suggest \nthat a thermal heater test of the type described would on its own provide insufficient \nevidence for assessing the risk of adverse thermal breakthrough and that the \ncombination of the tracer and thermal testing is the most effective testing regime for a \nfractured rock such as the Chalk.     \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements: \n \nOve Arup and partners, London. \nBritish Geological Survey \nCandy and Candy Ltd\nReferences \n \nBarker, J.
