For the system considered, it is found that the tail of the density of states\nentering the band gap is characterized by a certain penetration depth, which is proportional to the disorder\nparameter. A quantitative relation between the relative penetration depth, the relative width of the photonic\nband gap, and the disorder has been found. It is apparent that there is a certain level of disorder below which\nthe probability of the appearance of photonic eigenstates at the center of the photonic band gap essentially\nvanishes. Below the threshold, the ensemble-averaged transmission at the center of the photonic band gap does\nnot change significantly with increasing disorder, but above threshold it increases much more rapidly. A simple\nempirical formula has been obtained which describes how the logarithm of the transmission relates to the\nperiodic refractive index modulation and the disorder.\nDOI: 10.1103\/PhysRevB.73.033106 PACS number\u0001s\u0002: 42.70.Qs, 71.55.Jv\nAt present it is impossible to produce an ideal photonic\ncrystal for use at optical wavelengths. The deviation of the\nsphere diameters in opals1 and the roughness of the walls in\nlithographically produced structures lead to departures from\nthe intended periodic spatial distribution of dielectric\nconstant.2 Such imperfections can damage the photonic band\ngap \u0001PBG\u0002 significantly and result in a finite value of the\ndensity of states across the whole of the intended gap.3 As a\nresult, much effort has been spent on investigations of the\ninfluence of disorder on the PBG and the related problem of\nwave localization in disordered optical media, which is\ncalled Anderson localization in analogy with electron\nlocalization.4\nAs has previously been pointed out5 the term localization\nis commonly viewed in different ways in different areas of\nphysics. For example, in quantum mechanics particle local-\nization is usually discussed in terms of the existence of so-\nlutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation which decay expo-\nnentially from a certain region of space,6 while in optics it is\nmore natural to consider the propagation of light, and total\nreflection from a disordered medium is taken to be indicative\nof photonic localization.5,7\nNevertheless in an infinite one-dimensional \u00011D\u0002 disor-\ndered photonic system, each state is localized in the sense\nthat the density of electromagnetic energy \u0001\u0001z\u0002 \u0001or equiva-\nlently probability density in the particle case\u0002 has the form\nlimz\u2192\u0002\u0001i\u0001z\u0002\u0003exp\u0001\u2212\u0004z\u0004 \/\u0003i\u0002 where z is the position relative to\nthe region of localization.6,8,9 No definite conclusion about\nsystem behavior can be made for limited values of \u0004z\u0004 but a\nconsequence of such localization is that for a finite disor-\ndered system the transmission coefficient averaged over an\nensemble of structures \u0005T\u0006 decays exponentially with in-\ncreasing system size L, and can be described by an attenua-\ntion length \u0004 through the relation \u0005ln\u0001T\u0002\u0006\u0003\u2212L \/\u0004. However, it\nis important to realize that similar transmission properties\ncan be observed in perfectly ordered systems\u2014photonic\ncrystals\u2014if the frequency corresponds to the photonic band\ngap \u0001PBG\u0002. In this case the exponential decay is described by\nthe imaginary part of the Bloch wave vector. A distinction\nbetween the two phenomena is that the localization length\nfor Anderson localization decreases with increasing disorder,\nwhile for photonic crystals at frequencies corresponding to a\nPBG, \u0004 grows with increasing disorder.10\nThere have been numerous attempts to apply scaling\ntheory in the analysis of localization in disordered photonic\ncrystals.11 However Deych et al.12 have demonstrated\nanomalous behaviour of the variance of the Lyapunov expo-\nnent \u0004\u22121 and concluded that although states at frequencies\ncorresponding to bands of the photonic crystal have regular\nAnderson behavior, there are gap states that do not. They\nhave also shown that there is a critical value of disorder,\nabove which the anomalous behavior of the Lyapunov expo-\nnent disappears and all the states exhibit normal Anderson-\nlike behaviour. Therefore the exponential dependence of the\nensemble-averaged transmission coefficient on the length of\nthe structure does not allow us to make any definite conclu-\nsions about the modal structure of electromagnetic field.\nIn 1987 John stated that the \u201cphotonic band gap is filled\nwith localized photonic states even in the case of weak\ndisorder,\u201d13 but no quantitative estimate of the density of\nstates or other characteristics of the gap states were provided.\nHowever, in 1999 Vlasov and co authors10 found that as long\nas the disorder does not exceed a certain threshold value, the\nattenuation length within the PBG does not change signifi-\ncantly with increasing disorder. As a result, they suggested\nthat, in contrast to John\u2019s statement, localized states do not\nappear in the PBG for disorder below threshold, but they did\nnot demonstrate that explicitly by calculating the mode spec-\ntrum.\nTherefore, in an effort to clarify the physical picture of\nlight localization in disordered photonic crystals we have\nconducted ab initio calculations of both the mode structure\nof the electromagnetic field and the photon transport proper-\nties of 1D disordered photonic crystals.\nWe consider a one-dimensional periodic structure, which\nis a sequence of a pair of layers A and B of the same thick-\nness D \/2, whose refractive indices are nA,B\n\u00010\u0002\n=n0\u00b1g where g is\nthe modulation of the refractive index, and n0 is the average\nrefractive index. An infinite structure possesses PBGs, whose\npositions can be determined by solving the dispersion equa-\ntion 2 cos\u0001KD\u0002=tr\u0007T\u02c6 \u0001\u0005\u0002\b, where K is the Bloch wave vector\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 033106 \u00012006\u0002\n1098-0121\/2006\/73\u00013\u0002\/033106\u00014\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society033106-1\nand T\u02c6 is the transfer matrix for one period. The center of the\nfirst PBG is at \u00050=\u0006c \/n0D, and the relative width of the gap\nis \u0007\u0005 \/\u00050\t4g \/\u0006n0. In the case of a structure of finite size,\nthe mode spectrum is discrete and the eigenfrequencies can\nbe obtained by setting outgoing wave boundary conditions,\ncorresponding to light not being incident on the structure,\nusing the equation\nA\n 1\n\u2212 nf\n\u000b = M\u02c6 \n 1\nnl\n\u000b . \u00011\u0002\nHere nf and nl are the refractive indices of the semi-infinite\nmedia surrounding the structure, M\u02c6 is the transfer matrix\nthrough the whole structure, and A is a constant. Note that\nthe frequencies of the eigenmodes \u0005i will have nonzero\nimaginary parts, due to the leakage of the light through the\nboundaries. In other words, the lifetime of the eigenmodes\n\b=1\/Im\u0001\u0005i\u0002 will be finite. By analyzing the value of the\nlifetime, one can conclude whether the mode is localized or\nnot, according to the Thouless criterion.14 For electrons the\nThouless criterion considers a state to be localized if the\nwidth of the energy level \u0001proportional to the inverse life-\ntime\u0002 is less than the separation of energy levels; otherwise\nthe state is extended.\nThe squares in Fig. 1 denote the frequencies and lifetimes\nof the states in an ideal periodic structure of the length L\n=200D with n0=2 and g=0.025, surrounded by semi-infinite\nmedia with refractive indices nf =nl=1. An infinite structure\nwith such parameters possesses a PBG of relative width\n\u0007\u0005 \/\u00050\t0.016, whose boundaries are shown by vertical\nlines in Fig. 1. The lower horizontal line in each plot gives\nthe lifetime of the modes in the structure for which g=0 \u0001i.e.,\nthe Fabry-P\u00e9rot modes of a uniform structure\u0002. For these\nmodes the inverse lifetime is comparable to the frequency\ninterval between modes, and such states are delocalized. Pe-\nriodic modulation of the refractive index leads to an increase\nof the lifetime of the eigenmodes, and the increase is more\npronounced for the states close to the PBG edges. The states\nclosest to the edge of the PBG are called edge states, and\nwere first described by Kogelnick and Shank15 in the context\nof distributed feedback lasers. According to the Thouless cri-\nterion the edge states are localized, but the density of elec-\ntromagnetic energy decays to the edges of the structure more\nslowly than exponential.\nFor the study of the properties of disordered structures we\nintroduce random fluctuations of the refractive indices: for\neach pair of layers A and B in the unit cell, the refractive\nindices are defined by the formula nA,B=n0\u00b1g+n0\tP, where\nP takes random values in the interval from \u2212 12 to\n1\n2 and \t is\nconstant for a particular structure that specifies the level of\ndisorder. Thus the optical lengths Di of the unit cells in a\nparticular disordered structure are given by\nDi = D\u0001nA + nB\u0002\/2 = Dn0\u00011 + \tP\u0002 = D0\u00011 + \tP\u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere D0=n0D and the range of the random fluctuations in\nDi \/D0 is given by \t.\nThe dots in Fig. 1 represent the solutions of Eq. \u00011\u0002 and\nare plotted as \u0007Re\u0001\u0005i\u0002 ,1 \/ Im\u0001\u0005i\u0002\b for 103 disordered struc-\ntures with different configurations of the disorder character-\nized by the value of \t. For \t=0.035, the eigenfrequencies\nRe\u0001\u0005i\u0002 and their lifetimes \b fluctuate near the values corre-\nsponding to the eigenmodes of the ideal structure, but the\nfluctuations of the lifetime of the edge states near the PBG\nare larger than for those further away. Some of the modes\npenetrate into the PBG but there is no qualitative change of\nmode spectrum, as illustrated in Fig. 2, where the density of\nstates \u0001DOS\u0002 averaged over an ensemble of 104 structures is\nshown by circles. The fluctuation of Di can also be obtained\nby varying the layer thicknesses as described above for the\nrefractive index, and for this case the resulting DOS is shown\nby squares in Fig. 2.\nWhen the refractive indices and thicknesses of the layers\nare taken to fluctuate simultaneously and independently, and\nthe fluctuation of each quantity is characterized by a top-hat\ndistribution of relative width \t, the distribution function of\nthe optical length Di of a period of the structure will be\nalmost a Gaussian with width close to \t, as shown in the\ninset to Fig. 2 by the dotted line. The resulting DOS is shown\nin Fig. 2 by stars. Note that due to similar widths of the\ntop-hat and Gaussian distributions of Di, the densities of\nstates are practically identical for all the types of disorder\nFIG. 1. White squares denote the frequencies Re\u0001\u0005i\u0002 and life-\ntimes \b=1\/Im\u0001\u0005i\u0002 for an ideal structure \u0001\t=0\u0002. Dots show frequen-\ncies and lifetimes for eigenmodes obtained by solving Eq. \u00011\u0002 for\n103 disordered structures with \t=0.035, 0.07, 0.1, and 0.15. The\nthickness of the structure is L=200D and the modulation of refrac-\ntive index is g=0.025.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 033106 \u00012006\u0002\n033106-2\nconsidered. Thus we conclude that the density of modes in a\ndisordered photonic crystal is defined by the relative fluctua-\ntion of the optical length of one period of the structure.\nThe shape of the tails in the density of modes within the\nPBG is described with very high accuracy by the formula\n\n\u0003 exp\n\u2212 \u0001\u0005 \u2212 \u0005e\u00022\n\u000b2\n\u000b , \u00013\u0002\nwhere \u0005e is the angular frequency of the relevant band edge\nin the crystal and \u000b is penetration depth. The penetration\ndepth \u000b is found to be proportional to \t but does not depend\non the length of the structure \u0001as is to be expected since the\ndensity of states is a self-averaging quantity\u0002.\nWhen \t is increased to 0.07, the edge states penetrate\nfurther into the PBG and the fluctuations of the lifetime of\nthe modes increase. The width of the PBG is reduced but\nnevertheless remains substantial. Eventually, when \t is in-\ncreased to 0.1, the probability of the appearance of eigen-\nmodes in any part of the original PBG becomes substantial\nand the fluctuations in the lifetimes of the eigenstates are\ngreater.\nAn increase of \t to 0.15 leads to a decrease in the dip of\nthe density of states, an increase of the fluctuations of the\nlifetime, and a slight decrease of its mean value. Further\nincrease of \t leads to the disappearance of the effects asso-\nciated with the periodic modulation of the refractive index,\nand the system becomes completely disordered. We believe\nthat the filling of the PBG with states is the reason for the\ntransition from anomalous to normal behavior of the\nLyapunov exponent observed in Deych et al.12\nFor all the structures considered, the penetration depth \u000b\nis proportional to the square root of the relative band gap\nwidth \u0007\u0005 \/\u00050.\nIn Fig. 3 the dimensionless quantity \u0001\u000b \/\t\u00050\u0002\f\u00050 \/\u0007\u0005 is\nplotted as a function of the average refractive index in the\nstructure n0 which is related to the frequency of the center of\nthe PBG. The plot leads us to conclude that the penetration\ndepth is decribed by the formula\n\u000b\n\u00050\n\t\n\t\n5\n\f\u0007\u0005\n\u00050\n, \u00014\u0002\ni.e., the relative penetration depth exhibits a universal depen-\ndence on the relative gap width.\nEquation \u00014\u0002 provides a means to specify a practical cri-\nterion for the resilience of the PBG to the presence of disor-\nder. Assuming that for a particular application there is a cer-\ntain acceptable level of the density of states at the center of\nthe gap described by a suppression factor Sth, which is de-\nfined as the ratio of the densities of states at the center and\nthe edge of the PBG, the threshold value of the disorder \tth is\n\tth \t\n5\n2\f\u2212 ln Sth\n\f\u0007\u0005\n\u00050\n. \u00015\u0002\nFor example, suppression of the density of states at the\ncenter of the PBG by a factor 10\u22128 would correspond to \u000b\n\t\u0007\u0005 \/9, and a threshold disorder parameter given by \tth\n\t\f\u0001\u0007\u0005 \/\u00050\u0002 \/3. Note that the square root of the logarithm in\nEq. \u00015\u0002 varies very slowly with the change of the argument,\nFIG. 2.

The\nvertical bars indicate the standard deviation of this quantity. 104\nstructures were modeled for each set of the parameters n0, g, and \t.\nThe parameters g and \t are varied over the ranges 0.0125 to 0.125\nand 0.01 to 0.2 respectively.\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW B 73, 033106 \u00012006\u0002\n033106-3\nand the above estimate can be considered as an almost uni-\nversal criterion for the stability of the PBG in one-\ndimensional photonic crystals in the presence of disorder.\nAt the center of the PBG, the transmission coefficient\ndecays exponentially with the increase of the structure\nlength. The dependence of the attenuation length \u0004, defined\nas \u0004=\u2212L \/ ln\u0005T\u0006, on the fluctuation parameter \t for structures\nwith g=0.025, g=0.05, and g=0.1 is shown in Fig. 4. For all\nthe cases considered, the dependences are characterized by a\nthreshold; when \t\f\tth, \u0004 grows very slowly with increasing\n\t, and the attenuation length \u0004 is virtually unchanged. When\n\t reaches \tth, a threshold occurs in the dependence of \u0004 on \t,\nand \u0004 grows much faster with increasing \t. Such behavior\ncan be easily explained. The increase of \u0005T\u0006, and hence \u0004 is a\nconsequence of the appearance of sharp spikes, correspond-\ning to localized eigenmodes in the transmission spectrum of\nindividual structures.10 When \t\f\tth, the increase of the\ntransmission coefficient is provided by the tails of such\nspikes and therefore is very small. When \t\r\tth, localized\nstates and corresponding peaks in transmission spectra can\nappear in the center of the PBG, and \u0005T\u0006 starts to grow faster\nwith increasing \t.\nThe dependence of \tth on the relative width of the PBG\n\u0001or on the attenuation length \u00040 in the ideal structure\u0002 in Eq.\n\u00015\u0002 has an interesting consequence. If \u000e=g\u00011\u0002 \/g\u00012\u0002 is the ratio\nof modulations of the refractive indices g\u00011\u0002 and g\u00012\u0002 for two\nideal structures, then the dependences of the attenuation\nlength \u0004 on \t for the two structures are coupled remarkably\nwell by the relation\n\u000e\u0004\u00011\u0002\u0001\t\u0002 = \u0004\u00012\u0002\u0001\t\f\u000e\u0002 . \u00016\u0002\nIn Fig. 4 the crosses show the result of the transformation \u00016\u0002\non \u0004\u0001\t\u0002 for the structure with g=0.05, when \u000e=\u00040\u0001g\n=0.05\u0002 \/\u00040\u0001g=0.1\u0002. The circles show the result of the corre-\nsponding transformation for the structure with g=0.025, and\n\u000e=\u00040\u0001g=0.025\u0002 \/\u00040\u0001g=0.1\u0002. For the structures with g\n=0.025 and g=0.1, the transformation \u00016\u0002 couples the depen-\ndences \u0004\u0001\t\u0002 with very high accuracy. For the structure with\ng=0.025, when \t is larger than the threshold value, some\ndeviation occurs at the higher values of \t due to the fact that\nthe attenuation length is comparable to the sample size, and\nthe influence of boundaries is substantial.\nThe transformation in Eq. \u00016\u0002 reflects a universal behavior\nof the attenuation length \u0001and transmission coefficient\u0002 in\ndisordered photonic crystals, and could be useful in the de-\nvelopment of analytical theories of such systems. Finally we\nnote that the thresholdlike behavior of a transmission coeffi-\ncient on the disorder parameter has also been demonstrated\nfor two-dimensional photonic crystals.16,17\nTo conclude, we have analyzed quantitatively the penetra-\ntion of states into the band gap of a type of one-dimensional\ndisordered photonic crystal. We have shown that the tail of\nthe density of states in the band gap has a Gaussian form\ncharacterized by a penetration depth parameter and there is\nan allowed level of disorder below which the probability of\nthe appearance of photonic eigenstates at the center of pho-\ntonic band gap essentially vanishes. A relationship between\nthe relative penetration depth, relative gap width, and disor-\nder parameter has been found and a scaling formula relating\nthe attenuation length to the gap width and disorder has also\nbeen obtained.\nThe work was supported by EPSRC Grant.
