One, developed by Sturis et al. [19], and consisting of six nonlinear ordinary\ndi\ufb00erential equations, has been widely accepted. However, the model has the disadvantage of\ncontaining auxiliary variables which have no clinical interpretation. In this paper we study an\nalternative model which incorporates a time delay explicitly, negating the need for the auxiliary\nequations. A simplifying assumption of having just one insulin compartment reduces the\nnumber of equations still further. We then study the resulting system of two di\ufb00erential delay\nequations, establishing results on positivity, boundedness, persistence and global asymptotic\nstability. For the latter, two quite di\ufb00erent approaches are employed: comparison principles\nand Lyapunov functionals. The two approaches provide di\ufb00erent sets of su\ufb03cient conditions\nfor global stability, so that we investigate di\ufb00erent regions of parameter space.\n1 Introduction\nOver the last 50 years the interaction between glucose and insulin, its regulatory hormone,\nhas been studied by both theoretical and mathematical biologists [1, 5, 8]. Through\nbiological experiments it has been well-established [6, 9, 17, 18] that insulin secretion in\nthe pancreas oscillates on a number of di\ufb00erent time scales, ranging from tens of seconds\nto more than 100 minutes. The oscillations with larger period (80\u2013150 mins) are known\nas ultradian oscillations and a model developed by Sturis et al. [19] (see also Keener\n& Sneyd [7]) provides a possible mechanism for their origin. This model consists of six\nnonlinear ordinary di\ufb00erential equations and is detailed in Appendix I (system (4.1)).\nWhilst Sturis\u2019 model (recently modi\ufb01ed by Tolic et al. [20] to contain a more sophistic-\nated receptor down-regulation model and receptor modi\ufb01cation model) is consistent with\nobservable features of ultradian insulin oscillations, it has the disadvantage of arti\ufb01cially\nintroducing auxiliary variables which have no clinical interpretation. In this article we\nintroduce time delay into the model explicitly, thereby negating the need for the three\nauxiliary linear chain equations and their associated arti\ufb01cial parameters. In addition, we\nmake the further simplifying assumption that plasma and intercellular insulin are indis-\ntinguishable. The original model is thus reduced from six ODEs without delay, to two\nequations with delay. Li et al. [10] proposed a delay model which has certain similarities\nto the model we propose in this paper, but their model has the delay in the insulin\nequation.\n204 D. L. Bennett and S. A. Gourley\nThe model of the present paper was also considered by Engelborghs et al. [3]. In fact,\nthey modi\ufb01ed it to represent an external system interacting with an internal system in the\ncase of a diabetic patient. They studied the linearised stability of the equilibria and carried\nout some numerical bifurcation analysis. They extensively investigated several branches\nof periodic solutions and their stability.\nIn the present paper, we study the simpli\ufb01ed system analytically to determine some of\nits fundamental properties and, especially, to obtain theorems on the global stability of\nthe equilibria. Also, we have aimed to keep the functions fi (in system (2.1) below) as\ngeneral as possible, rather than restricting to the particular fi mentioned in Appendix A.\nWe make only general qualitative assumptions on the fi; those that are dictated by the\nneed for biological realism. The paper is organised as follows: in \u00a7 2 we present our model\nand some of its basic properties, \u00a7 3 addresses global stability, Appendix A summarises\nthe model of Sturis et al. [19] and Appendix B lists the properties of the functions fi used\nin our model.\n2 The model equations and preliminary results\nWe \ufb01rst modify Sturis\u2019 model by explicitly incorporating a discrete delay term into the\nglucose equation. In this way the three auxiliary variables of Sturis\u2019s model representing\nthe delay between plasma insulin and its e\ufb00ect on hepatic glucose production can be\ndispensed with. To reduce the number of equations still further, we assume there is only\none insulin compartment rather than two (i.e. no distinction between plasma insulin and\nintracellular insulin). Therefore, tp and ti in system (4.1) are taken to be equal and we\nintroduce I = Ip+Ii. These modi\ufb01cations yield the following model to be solved for t > 0:\ndI\/dt = f1(G) \u2212 1\u03c40 I,\ndG\/dt = Gin \u2212 f2(G) \u2212 qGf4(I) + f5(I(t \u2212 \u03c4)),\nI(s) = I0(s) \u0001 0, s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] with I0(0) > 0,\nG(0) = G0 > 0,\n(2.1)\nwhere the functions f1, f2, f4 and f5 satisfy the assumptions in Appendix B, and q > 0\nis a constant. Note that there is no function labelled f3. In fact, f3(G) is the linear term\nqG in the second equation. Since Sturis et al. [19] took their function f3(G) to be linear\n(see the third equation of system (4.1) in Appendix A, and the expression (4.5) for their\nf3(G)), it seemed more convenient for us to take f3(G) as qG at the outset, while keeping\nthe other fi general. We decided to retain the original subscripts on the functions f4 and\nf5 to allow direct comparison with the original paper.\nIn (2.1), I and G represent the quantities of insulin (mU) and glucose (mg), respectively.\nPancreatic insulin production controlled by glucose concentration is represented by the\nfunction f1(G). I\/\u03c40 is the degradation rate of insulin by the body and Gin > 0 represents\nthe input of glucose from outside the system. Glucose uptake by the brain and nerve\ncells is described by the function f2(G). Glucose utilization by muscle and fat cells which\nis dependent on both glucose and insulin concentration is represented by the third term\nin the second equation of (2.1). The last term in the second equation of (2.1) represents\nhepatic glucose production which is in\ufb02uenced by insulin.\nGlobal stability in a model of the glucose-insulin interaction 205\n2.1 Positivity and boundedness\nProposition 2.1 Let the fi satisfy the assumptions listed in Appendix B. Then all solutions\nof the model (2.1) exist for all t > 0 and are strictly positive.\nProof Let (G(t), I(t)) be a solution of (2.1). If G(t0) = 0 for some t0 > 0, and if t0 is the\n\ufb01rst such time, then G\u02d9(t0) \u0002 0. However, at t0, the glucose equation becomes\nG\u02d9(t0) = Gin\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\n> 0\n\u2212 f2(G(t0))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0\n\u2212 qG(t0)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=0\nf4(I(t0)) + f5(I(t0 \u2212 \u03c4))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n> 0\n> 0.\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, G(t) > 0 for all t > 0. By similar reasoning, I(t) > 0\nfor all t. \u0001\nProposition 2.2 Let the fi satisfy the assumptions listed in Appendix B. Then all solutions\nof the model (2.1) are bounded.\nProof First we establish the boundedness of I(t). Solving the \ufb01rst equation of (2.1) for\nI(t) we have\nI(t) = e\n\u2212t\n\u03c40 I(0) + e\n\u2212t\n\u03c40\n\u222b t\n0\ne\ns\n\u03c40 f1(G(s))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u0002f1(\u221e)\nds \u0002 e\n\u2212t\n\u03c40 I(0) + f1(\u221e)\u03c40(1 \u2212 e \u2212t\u03c40 )\nand thus I(t) is bounded for all t.\nFrom the second equation of (2.1) we have\nG\u02d9(t) = Gin \u2212 f2(G) \u2212 qGf4(I) + f5(I(t \u2212 \u03c4)) \u0002 Gin \u2212 qGf4(I)\ufe38\ufe37\ufe37\ufe38\n\u0001f4(0)\n+f5(I(t \u2212 \u03c4))\n\u0002 Gin \u2212 qGf4(0) + f5(I(t \u2212 \u03c4))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n\u0002f5(0)\n\u0002 Gin \u2212 qGf4(0) + f5(0).\nTherefore,\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nG(t) \u0002\nGin + f5(0)\nqf4(0)\nand also\nG(t) \u0002MG := max\n{\nG(0),\n1\nqf4(0)\n(Gin + f5(0))\n}\nfor all t. The proof is complete. \u0001\nLet (G(t), I(t)) be a solution of (2.1). Throughout this paper, we de\ufb01ne\nG = lim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\nG(t), G = lim inf\nt\u2192\u221e G(t), I = lim supt\u2192\u221e\nI(t), I = lim inf\nt\u2192\u221e I(t).\nBy Propositions 2.1 and 2.2, these quantities are all \ufb01nite. The following well known\n\ufb02uctuation lemma is stated below without proof:\n206 D. L. Bennett and S. A. Gourley\nLemma 2.3 Let f : R \u2192 R be a di\ufb00erentiable function. If\nl = lim inf\nt\u2192\u221e f(t) < lim supt\u2192\u221e\nf(t) = L,\nthen there are sequences {tk} \u2191 \u221e, {sk} \u2191 \u221e such that, for all k,\nf\u2032(tk) = f\u2032(sk) = 0, lim\nk\u2192\u221e f(tk) = L and limk\u2192\u221e f(sk) = l.\nProposition 2.4 Model (2.1) is uniformly persistent, i.e. solutions are eventually uniformly\nbounded from above and below.\nProof If I < I then, by Lemma 2.3, there exist sequences {tk} \u2191 \u221e, {sk} \u2191 \u221e, such that\nI\u02d9(tk) = I\u02d9(sk) = 0, lim\nk\u2192\u221e I(tk) = I and limk\u2192\u221e I(sk) = I.\nThus, from the \ufb01rst equation of (2.1), we have\n0 = I\u02d9(tk) = f1(G(tk)) \u2212 1\n\u03c40\nI(tk)\nand\n0 = I\u02d9(sk) = f1(G(sk)) \u2212 1\n\u03c40\nI(sk)\nfor all k.\nLet \u03b5 > 0 be arbitrary. Then there exists T0 > 0 such that, for all t \u0001 T0,\nG(t) \u0002 G+ \u03b5.\nAlso, there exists an integer k0 such that k \u0001 k0 \u21d2 tk \u0001 T0 and, therefore,\nG(tk) \u0002 G+ \u03b5.\nHence, for k su\ufb03ciently large,\n0 = f1(G(tk)) \u2212 1\n\u03c40\nI(tk) \u0002 f1(G+ \u03b5) \u2212 1\n\u03c40\nI(tk)\nsince f1 is increasing. Letting k \u2192 \u221e and then \u03b5 \u2192 0,\nI \u0002 \u03c40f1(G). (2.2)\nIn a similar way, we can show using the sequence sk that\nI \u0001 \u03c40f1(G). (2.3)\nCombining (2.2) and (2.3),\n\u03c40f1(G) \u0002 I < I \u0002 \u03c40f1(G). (2.4)\nGlobal stability in a model of the glucose-insulin interaction 207\nRecall from the proof of Proposition 2.2 that\nG \u0002\n1\nqf4(0)\n(Gin + f5(0)). (2.5)\nso that G is bounded above. Note that (2.4) recovers the result that I is bounded above\nalso. We now need to prove that G > 0 and I > 0.\nIf G < G then there exist sequences {t\u2032k} \u2191 \u221e, {s\u2032k} \u2191 \u221e, such that\nG\u02d9(t\u2032k) = G\u02d9(s\u2032k) = 0, lim\nk\u2192\u221eG(t\n\u2032\nk) = G and lim\nk\u2192\u221eG(s\n\u2032\nk) = G.\nThe second equation of (2.1) then gives, for all k,\n0 = G\u02d9(s\u2032k) = Gin \u2212 f2(G(s\u2032k)) \u2212 qG(s\u2032k)f4(I(s\u2032k)) + f5(I(s\u2032k \u2212 \u03c4)).\nLet \u03b5 > 0. Then there exists T2 > 0 such that, for all t \u0001 T2, I(t) \u0002 I + \u03b5. For all k\nsu\ufb03ciently large, s\u2032k \u2212 \u03c4 \u0001 T2 and therefore I(s\u2032k \u2212 \u03c4) \u0002 I+ \u03b5. Hence, for k su\ufb03ciently large,\n0 = Gin \u2212 f2(G(s\u2032k)) \u2212 qG(s\u2032k)f4(I(s\u2032k)) + f5(I(s\u2032k \u2212 \u03c4))\n\u0001 Gin \u2212 f2(G(s\u2032k)) \u2212 qG(s\u2032k)f4(I + \u03b5) + f5(I + \u03b5)\nsince f4 is increasing and f5 decreasing. Letting k \u2192 \u221e and then \u03b5 \u2192 0,\n0 \u0001 Gin \u2212 f2(G) \u2212 qGf4(I) + f5(I). (2.6)\nNow suppose, for contradiction, that G = 0. Substituting this into (2.6) gives\n0 \u0001 Gin + f5(I) > 0,\na contradiction. Therefore G > 0. From (2.4) we now have I > 0 also. The proof is\ncomplete. \u0001\n2.2 Equilibria\nLet us investigate the equilibria (I\u2217, G\u2217) of our system. The \ufb01rst equation of (2.1) gives\nI\u2217 = \u03c40f1(G\u2217). (2.7)\nFrom this, we obtain a single equation for G\u2217:\n0 = Gin \u2212 f2(G\u2217) \u2212 qG\u2217f4(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)) + f5(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)). (2.8)\nDe\ufb01ne\nh(G) = Gin \u2212 f2(G) \u2212 qGf4(\u03c40f1(G)) + f5(\u03c40f1(G)).\nThen h(0) = Gin + f5(\u03c40f1(0)) > 0. Also, by the various properties of f2, f4 and f5 listed\nin Appendix B, it is clear that h(G) < 0 for G su\ufb03ciently large. It is also straightforward\nto show that h\u2032(G) < 0 for all G > 0. Hence there exists precisely one root G\u2217 > 0 of (2.8),\nand therefore there is one equilibrium (I\u2217, G\u2217) of (2.1).\n208 D. L. Bennett and S. A. Gourley\n3 Global convergence to equilibrium\nIn this section we shall provide some conditions under which global convergence of\nsolutions to the equilibrium (I\u2217, G\u2217) is assured. Our \ufb01rst approach is to use a comparison\nprinciple. This approach furnishes a set of conditions which involve the parameter \u03c40, but\nnot the delay \u03c4. Our second approach, by use of Lyapunov functionals, yields another\nset of su\ufb03cient conditions which do involve the delay \u03c4, yielding further insight into the\nbehaviour of the system.\n3.1 Comparison principle approach\nSolving the \ufb01rst equation of (2.1) for I(t), gives\nI(t) = e\n\u2212t\n\u03c40 I(0) + e\n\u2212t\n\u03c40\n\u222b t\n0\ne\ns\n\u03c40 f1(G(s)) ds.\nSince we are interested in the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions, we shall neglect the\n\ufb01rst term in the above. Substituting the remaining expression into the second equation\nof (2.1), we can recast the original model into the form of a single equation\ndG\ndt\n= Gin \u2212 f2(G) \u2212 qGf4\n(\u222b t\n0\ne\n\u2212(t\u2212s)\n\u03c40 f1(G(s)) ds\n)\n+ f5\n(\u222b t\u2212\u03c4\n0\ne\n\u2212(t\u2212\u03c4\u2212s)\n\u03c40 f1(G(s)) ds\n)\n, t > 0, (3.1)\nwhich now requires as initial data:\nG(s) = G0(s), s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0] (3.2)\nwhere G0(s) is a prescribed, continuous, non-negative, initial function with G0(0) > 0.\nAlthough we have reduced the original system (2.1) to a single equation, this has been\ndone at the expense of now having to deal with distributed delay terms. We shall now\nintroduce a de\ufb01nition of sub- and supersolutions appropriate to our problem, and then\nstate a comparison principle which shall be used to prove a theorem on global convergence.\nDe\ufb01nition A pair of sub- and supersolutions for (3.1,3.2) is a pair of suitably smooth\nfunctions v and w such that:\n(i) v \u0002 w for all t;\n(ii) v and w satisfy\ndv\ndt\n\u0002 Gin \u2212 f2(v) \u2212 qvf4\n(\u222b t\n0\ne\n\u2212(t\u2212s)\n\u03c40 f1(\u03c6(s))ds\n)\n+ f5\n(\u222b t\u2212\u03c4\n0\ne\n\u2212(t\u2212\u03c4\u2212s)\n\u03c40 f1(\u03c6(s))ds\n)\ndw\ndt\n\u0001 Gin \u2212 f2(w) \u2212 qwf4\n(\u222b t\n0\ne\n\u2212(t\u2212s)\n\u03c40 f1(\u03c6(s))ds\n)\n+ f5\n(\u222b t\u2212\u03c4\n0\ne\n\u2212(t\u2212\u03c4\u2212s)\n\u03c40 f1(\u03c6(s))ds\n)\nfor all functions \u03c6 such that v(s) \u0002 \u03c6(s) \u0002 w(s), s \u0002 t;\n(iii) v(s) \u0002 G0(s) \u0002 w(s) for all s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0].\nGlobal stability in a model of the glucose-insulin interaction 209\nWe shall employ the following comparison principle, which is a consequence of\nTheorem 3.4 in Redlinger [14]:\nLemma 3.1 If there are sub- and supersolutions v and w for (3.1), (3.2), then there exists\na unique solution G(t) of (3.1), (3.2) such that v(t) \u0002 G(t) \u0002 w(t) for all t.\nTrivially, we have that 0 is a subsolution of (3.1), (3.2). Let us seek a supersolution.\nDe\ufb01ne G\u02c6 to be the solution of\ndG\u02c6\ndt\n= Gin \u2212 f2(G\u02c6) \u2212 qG\u02c6f4(0) + f5(0), t > 0.\nAlthough this is not a delay equation, we do need to de\ufb01ne G\u02c6 on the interval [\u2212\u03c4, 0]\nbecause of condition (iii) in the above De\ufb01nition. For s \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0), we shall take G\u02c6(s) :=\nG\u02c6(0) := max{G0(\u02dcs), s\u02dc \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0]}.

Therefore, (0, G\u02c6) is a sub- supersolution pair and thus there exists\na unique solution G(t) to (3.1,3.2) such that 0 \u0002 G(t) \u0002 G\u02c6(t) for all t.\nOur main theorem of this subsection is the following.\nTheorem 3.2 Let the fi satisfy the assumptions listed in Appendix B, and suppose that the\nsimultaneous equations\nGin \u2212 f2(x) \u2212 qxf4(\u03c40f1(y)) + f5(\u03c40f1(y)) = 0 (3.4)\nGin \u2212 f2(y) \u2212 qyf4(\u03c40f1(x)) + f5(\u03c40f1(x)) = 0 (3.5)\nhave no solution in the \ufb01rst quadrant other than x = y = G\u2217.

Furthermore, \u03bd0 satis\ufb01es\nGin \u2212 f2(\u03bd0) \u2212 q\u03bd0f4(0) + f5(0) = 0. (3.7)\nWe now improve the subsolution. Let \u03b5 > 0. By (3.6), there exists t1 > 1 such that\nG(t) \u0002 \u03bd0 + \u03b5 for all t \u0001 t1 \u2212 1\nand there exists t2 > t1 + \u03c4 such that\u222b t\nt\u2212t1\ne\u2212s\/\u03c40 ds < \u03b5 for all t \u0001 t2 \u2212 \u03c4.\nSince G(t) is majorized by G\u02c6(t), and the latter is a monotone function (it satis\ufb01es a\none-dimensional autonomous ODE), we can say that, for all t \u0001 \u2212\u03c4,\nG(t) \u0002 M\u02dcG := max(\u03bd0, max{G0(\u02dcs), s\u02dc \u2208 [\u2212\u03c4, 0]}).\nIntroduce the function\nz(1)(t) =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\nM\u02dcG, \u2212\u03c4 \u0002 t \u0002 t1 \u2212 1\n\u03bd0 + \u03b5+ (M\u02dcG \u2212 \u03bd0 \u2212 \u03b5)(t1 \u2212 t), t1 \u2212 1 < t < t1\n\u03bd0 + \u03b5, t \u0001 t1\nand also the \u2018cut-o\ufb00\u2019 operator\n(A(1)G)(t) = max(0,min(G(t), z(1)(t))).\nWe see that G(t) \u0002 z(1)(t) for all t since 0 \u0002 G(t) \u0002 \u03bd0 + \u03b5 for t \u0001 t1 \u22121 and 0 \u0002 G(t) \u0002 M\u02dcG\nfor all t (in particular for t < t1 \u22121). Hence, A(1)G = G and therefore replacing G by A(1)G\nin the delay terms of equation (3.1) leaves the solution unaltered. Of course, we shall also\ncarry out this replacement in the de\ufb01nition of sub- and supersolutions, with the e\ufb00ect\nthat the functions \u03c6 in that de\ufb01nition are \u2018cut o\ufb00\u2019 by the operator A(1). This leads to an\nimproved subsolution.\nIt is straightforward to see that the solution of (3.1), (3.2) satis\ufb01es G(t) > 0 for all t > 0.\nTherefore, if\n\u03b41 =\n1\n2\nmin\n{\nG(t): 1\n2\nt2 \u0002 t \u0002 t2\n}\nthen \u03b41 > 0.

(3.9)\nNow p\u2032(\u00b5; \u03b5) < 0 for all \u00b5 \u0001 0. Also, p(0; \u03b5) > 0 and p(\u00b5; \u03b5) < 0 for su\ufb03ciently large\n\u00b5. Therefore, p(\u00b5; \u03b5) = 0 has one strictly positive root \u00b5 = \u00b51(\u03b5) which is a continuous\nfunction of \u03b5, and p(\u00b5; \u03b5) > 0 when \u00b5 \u2208 (0, \u00b51(\u03b5)) and p(\u00b5; \u03b5) < 0 when \u00b5 > \u00b51(\u03b5). It follows\nthat\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e v1(t; \u03b5) = \u00b51(\u03b5).\nWe still need to check that v1 < M\u02dcG for all t \u0001 0. Now, using (2.8),\np(G\u2217; \u03b5) = qG\u2217f4(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)) \u2212 qG\u2217f4(\u03b5f1(M\u02dcG) + \u03c40f1(\u03bd0 + \u03b5))\n+ f5(\u03b5f1(M\u02dcG) + \u03c40f1(\u03bd0 + \u03b5)) \u2212 f5(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)).\n212 D. L. Bennett and S. A. Gourley\nIf we can show G\u2217 \u0002 \u03bd0 then p(G\u2217; \u03b5) < 0. Assume, for contradiction, that G\u2217 > \u03bd0. Then\nfrom (3.7) and (2.8) it is necessary that\n0 = f2(G\n\u2217) \u2212 f2(\u03bd0)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n>0\n+ qG\u2217f4(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)) \u2212 q\u03bd0f4(0)\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n>0\n+ f5(0) \u2212 f5(\u03c40f1(G\u2217))\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n>0\n,\na contradiction. Hence G\u2217 \u0002 \u03bd0 and p(G\u2217; \u03b5) < 0. Therefore \u00b51(\u03b5) < G\u2217 \u0002 \u03bd0 \u0002 M\u02dcG. Since\nv1 approaches its limit \u00b51(\u03b5) monotonically, our observations are su\ufb03cient to ensure that\nv1 \u0002 M\u02dcG for all t \u0001 0. So v1 is a subsolution and, from Lemma 3.1,\nv1(t; \u03b5) \u0002 G(t) \u0002 M\u02dcG.\nLetting \u03b5 \u2192 0 and writing \u00b51(0) = \u00b51 we conclude that I \u2282 [\u00b51, \u03bd0], where \u00b51 satis\ufb01es\nGin \u2212 f2(\u00b51) \u2212 q\u00b51f4(\u03c40f1(\u03bd0)) + f5(\u03c40f1(\u03bd0)) = 0.\nOne can then improve this to I \u2282 [\u00b51, \u03bd1] where \u03bd1 is de\ufb01ned in terms of \u00b50. Carrying\non with this process (the details are similar to those already presented), one \ufb01nds that\nI \u2282 [\u00b5n, \u03bdn] for each n \u2208 \u0001, where (\u00b5n) and (\u03bdn) are de\ufb01ned by\nGin \u2212 f2(\u00b5n+1) \u2212 q\u00b5n+1f4(\u03c40f1(\u03bdn)) + f5(\u03c40f1(\u03bdn)) = 0,\n(3.10)\nGin \u2212 f2(\u03bdn+1) \u2212 q\u03bdn+1f4(\u03c40f1(\u00b5n)) + f5(\u03c40f1(\u00b5n)) = 0.\nWe shall show by induction that\n0 < \u00b50 \u0002 \u00b51 \u0002 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0002 \u00b5n < G\u2217 < \u03bdn \u0002 \u03bdn\u22121 \u0002 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u0002 \u03bd1 \u0002 \u03bd0.

Hence (3.12) is satis\ufb01ed. Similarly, we can show\nthat (3.13) holds, proving (3.11). We can deduce that there exist the limits\n\u00b5 = lim\nn\u2192\u221e \u00b5n and \u03bd = limn\u2192\u221e \u03bdn\nand, from (3.10) with n \u2192 \u221e,\nGin \u2212 f2(\u00b5) \u2212 q\u00b5f4(\u03c40f1(\u03bd)) + f5(\u03c40f1(\u03bd)) = 0,\nGin \u2212 f2(\u03bd) \u2212 q\u03bdf4(\u03c40f1(\u00b5)) + f5(\u03c40f1(\u00b5)) = 0.\nBy the hypothesis of the theorem, these equations have only the solution \u00b5 = \u03bd = G\u2217.\nSince I \u2282 [\u00b5, \u03bd], it follows that I = {G\u2217} and the proof of the theorem is complete. \u0001\nAs promised earlier, we shall now discuss the circumstances under which the simultan-\neous equations (3.4,3.5) are likely to have only the solution x = y = G\u2217. With only the\ngeneral assumptions on the fi listed in Appendix B to work with, it is di\ufb03cult to ascertain\nprecisely the circumstances, but by some simple graphical arguments we can make some\nvery useful comments.\nEquation (3.4) de\ufb01nes a curve y = y(x) in the (x, y) plane. Only the \ufb01rst quadrant\nis of interest. From the properties of the fi it is easy to see that this curve intersects\nthe x-axis precisely once, but does not intersect the y-axis. Furthermore, by implicitly\ndi\ufb00erentiating (3.4) with respect to x, with y = y(x), we \ufb01nd that\ny\u2032(x) =\nf\u20322(x) + qf4(\u03c40f1(y))\n\u03c40f\n\u2032\n1(y){f\u20325(\u03c40f1(y)) \u2212 qxf\u20324(\u03c40f1(y))}\n(3.14)\nso that, since f5 is decreasing, y(x) is always decreasing along the curve. The second\nequation (3.5) de\ufb01nes a curve that is the mirror image, in the line y = x, of the curve we\nhave just been discussing.\nThe graphs shown in Fig. 1 illustrate two possibilities. In one of these the two curves\nhave only the x = y = G\u2217 intersection while, in the other, there are two additional\nintersections so that the hypothesis of Theorem 3.2 is not satis\ufb01ed. On a \ufb01rst glance, what\nappears to distinguish the two cases is the slopes at the intersection with y = x. It is\nactually not as simple as this; one can imagine that curve 1 could be very steep until just\nafter its intersection with y = x, and then suddenly swing round and intersect curve 2 in\ntwo further places below y = x. However, MAPLE plots of the two curves for the case\nwhen the fi are given by expressions (4.2), (4.3), (4.4) and (4.6) of Appendix A suggest\nthat this never happens and that for all biologically reasonable sets of parameter values\nit is indeed the slopes at the intersection with y = x that distinguishes the two cases.\nExamining the slopes at x = y = G\u2217, we require the slope of curve 1 at that point to be\nless than \u22121. Equation (3.14) then gives us\nf\u20322(G\u2217) + qf4(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)) + \u03c40f\u20321(G\u2217) {f\u20325(\u03c40f1(G\u2217)) \u2212 qG\u2217f\u20324(\u03c40f1(G\u2217))} > 0.

Qualitative sketches of the curves de\ufb01ned by equations (3.4) and (3.5) showing two\npossibilities, only one of which satis\ufb01es the hypothesis of Theorem 3.2.\n3.2 Lyapunov functional approach\nIn the approach to be described in this section, we shall work with the original prob-\nlem (2.1). The functions fi shall take the expressions given in Appendix A, and our aim\nis to study how the global stability of the equilibrium (G\u2217, I\u2217) of (2.1) depends on \u03c40 and\n\u03c4. It is inconvenient and unnecessary to carry the exact expressions for the fi through all\nthe analysis; we shall call upon the actual expressions only as necessary.\nApplying the transformation\nG = G\u2217 + u, I = I\u2217 + v\nto system (2.1) gives\nu\u02d9 = \u2212uf\u20322(G\u2217 + \u03b82u) \u2212 uqf4(I\u2217) \u2212 vf\u20324(I\u2217 + \u03b84v)q(G\u2217 + u)+ v(t \u2212 \u03c4)f\u20325(I\u2217 + \u03b85v(t \u2212 \u03c4))\nv\u02d9 = uf\u20321(G\u2217 + \u03b81u) \u2212 1\u03c40 v (3.16)\nwhere the \u03b8i come from applications of Taylor\u2019s theorem with remainder, for example,\nf2(G\n\u2217 + u(t)) = f2(G\u2217) + u(t)f\u20322(G\u2217 + u(t)\u03b81(u(t)))\nwhere, for all t, \u03b81 is between 0 and 1. We do not need to keep track of the dependence\nof the \u03b8i on the state variables or the times at which these are evaluated (for example,\n\u03b81(u(t)) and \u03b81(u(s)) shall both appear simply as \u03b81 in our analysis). All that we need to\nknow about the \u03b8i is that they are always between 0 and 1.\nIn the new system (3.16) the equilibrium of interest is u = v = 0. In what follows, u and\nv are always evaluated at time t except where otherwise shown. In the following analysis,\nGlobal stability in a model of the glucose-insulin interaction 215\nwe shall several times make use of the inequality\nxy \u0002\n1\n2\n\u03b5ix\n2 +\n1\n2\u03b5i\ny2\nwith suitably chosen \u03b5i.

The following theorem arises from\nparticular choices that seem to capture the essence of things.\nTheorem 3.3 Let f1(G) be given by (4.2), f2(G) by (4.4), f4(I) by (4.6) and f5(I) by (4.3).\nAlso, let\nA =\n(\n\u03b2+1\n\u03b2\u22121\n)\u2212 1\n\u03b2\nC4ViEti\nEti + Vi\nand\nMG = max{G(0), 1\nqf4(0)\n(Gin + f5(0))}.\nThen the positive equilibrium (G\u2217, I\u2217) of system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable for \u03c40\nand \u03c4 su\ufb03ciently small that\nf\u20322(MG) + qf4(I\u2217) \u2212 2\u03c40f\u20321(C1Vg)(f\u20324(A)qMG + |f\u20325(C5Vi)|)\n\u2212 1\n2\n|f\u20325(C5Vi)|\n(\n2\u03c4f\u20321(C1Vg) +\nf\u20321(C1Vg)|f\u20325(C5Vi)|\u03c42\n(f\u20324(A)qMG + |f\u20325(C5Vi)|)\u03c40\n)\n> 0\n(3.19)\n(recall I\u2217 = \u03c40f1(G\u2217)).\nProof We need to choose \u03b51, \u03b52, \u03b53 and \u03c9 so that (3.17) and (3.18) both hold.

The proof is\ncomplete. \u0001\n4 Conclusion\nThe two approaches employed in this paper for establishing su\ufb03cient conditions for global\nconvergence to equilibrium have yielded two sets of su\ufb03cient conditions which involve\n218 D. L. Bennett and S. A. Gourley\ndi\ufb00erent parameters of the problem. The conditions generated by the comparison principle\napproach are somewhat implicit, requiring a certain pair of simultaneous equations to have\nonly a certain known solution. Graphical considerations and MAPLE experiments describe\nthe circumstances in which these conditions are likely to hold, suggesting in particular that\nthey hold if the parameter \u03c40, which measures the timescale on which insulin degrades,\nis small. The conditions provided by the comparison principle approach do not involve\nthe parameter \u03c4, which measures the time delay between the appearance of insulin in\nthe plasma and its resultant suppressive e\ufb00ect on the rate of glucose production. If the\nconditions generated by the comparison principle approach hold, then global stability\nis assured independently of the value of \u03c4. In situations when a delay is incapable of\ndestabilising an equilibrium however large it is, the delay is sometimes said to be harmless.\nThe Lyapunov functional approach leads to a su\ufb03cient condition for global stability\nthat involves the parameter \u03c4, and therefore the role of \u03c4 is discovered to some extent.\nAgain, the conditions are su\ufb03cient but not necessary. Note that in the Lyapunov functional\napproach we have used the expressions for the functions fi that previous investigators\nhave used (see Sturis et al. [19]). However, in fact only certain particular properties of\nthese functions are used, most notably, the maximum values of their derivatives.\nThe su\ufb03cient conditions for global stability produced by the two approaches cease to\nhold in precisely the circumstances in which other investigators have noted that oscillations\nappear. It is known (see, for example, Keener & Sneyd [7]) that a su\ufb03ciently large infusion\nof glucose (Gin large) can cause oscillations. Raising Gin has the e\ufb00ect of raising G\n\u2217, as\ncan be seen by examining the function h(G) de\ufb01ned in \u00a7 2.2. Raising G\u2217 has the e\ufb00ect of\nviolating inequality (3.15) which comes from the comparison principle approach.\nRaising Gin has the e\ufb00ect of raising MG and I\n\u2217 and therefore, eventually, of violating\ncondition (3.19) which is the condition for stability generated by the Lyapunov functional\napproach (note that f\u20322 and f4 are uniformly bounded). On the other hand, the conditions\npredict convergence to the equilibrium if f\u20321(G\u2217) is small (comparison principle approach)\nor f\u20321(C1Vg) is su\ufb03ciently small (Lyapunov functional approach). This implies that there\nwill be no oscillations if insulin production (stimulated by glucose) is low.\nAppendix A\nThe model proposed by Sturis et al. [19] is\ndIp\ndt\n= f1(G) \u2212 E\n(\nIp\nVp\n\u2212 Ii\nVi\n)\n\u2212 Ip\ntp\n,\ndIi\ndt\n= E\n(\nIp\nVp\n\u2212 Ii\nVi\n)\n\u2212 Ii\nti\n,\ndG\ndt\n= Gin \u2212 f2(G) \u2212 f3(G)f4(Ii) + f5(x3),\ndx1\ndt\n=\n3\ntd\n(Ip \u2212 x1),\ndx2\ndt\n=\n3\ntd\n(x1 \u2212 x2),\ndx3\ndt\n=\n3\ntd\n(x2 \u2212 x3). (4.1)\nGlobal stability in a model of the glucose-insulin interaction 219\nIn this system, Ip, Ii and G represent the quantities of plasma insulin (mU), intercellular\ninsulin (mU) and glucose (mg) respectively. The equations are written in terms of the total\namounts of these quantities. All the parameters and functional relations in the model are\nbased on the results of independent experiments. Appropriate values for the parameters\ncan be found in Tolic et al. [20].\nThe model contains three separate compartments: glucose in the plasma and intercellu-\nlar space, insulin in the intercellular space and insulin in the plasma. It can be regarded as\nhaving two time delays. The time lag between the appearance of insulin in the plasma and\nits inhibitory e\ufb00ect on hepatic glucose production (see Bradley et al. [2]) is modelled as\nthe three-stage linear \ufb01lter (x1, x2, x3) and is measured by td. Additionally, there is a delay\nrelated to the fact that the physiological action of insulin on the utilization of glucose is\nregulated by the intercellular insulin rather than the plasma insulin [12], whereas glucose\nhas a direct e\ufb00ect on plasma insulin. Mathematically, one could solve the second equation\nfor Ii in terms of Ip and the \ufb01rst equation would then take the form of a distributed delay\nequation.\nThe \ufb01rst equation represents insulin being secreted by the pancreas into the plasma,\nwhere it is either degraded by the kidneys\/liver or transported into the intercellular space.\nVp is the distribution volume for insulin in plasma and Vi is the e\ufb00ective volume of the\nintercellular space. Insulin exchange between the two compartments is a linear function of\nthe concentration di\ufb00erence between the compartments (\nIp\nVp\n\u2212 Ii\nVi\n) with rate constant E. In\naddition, there is linear removal of insulin from the plasma by the kidneys and the liver,\nwith rate constant 1\ntp\n. Pancreatic insulin production controlled by glucose is described by\nf1(G) =\nRm\n1 + exp\n(\n1\na1\n(\nC1 \u2212 GVg\n)) (4.2)\nwhich has been \ufb01tted to experimental results ([11] & [17]). The second equation of model\n(4.1) represents the accumulation of intercellular insulin via exchange with the plasma\ncompartment and its degradation in muscle and adipose tissue at a rate 1\nti\n. The third\nequation models glucose being supplied to the plasma at an exogenously (uptake from\nfood or intravenous glucose infusion) controlled rate Gin. The in\ufb02uence of insulin on\nhepatic glucose production, as determined by Rizza et al. [16] is described by\nf5(I) =\nRg\n1 + exp\n(\n\u03b1\n(\nI\nVi\n\u2212 C5)) . (4.3)\nGlucose utilization is represented by two terms: f2(G) which describes insulin-independent\nutilization (glucose uptake by the brain and nerve cells) and f3(G)f4(Ii) which describes\ninsulin-dependent glucose utilization (glucose uptake by muscle and fat cells). These\nfunctions are given by\nf2(G) = Ub\n(\n1 \u2212 exp\n( \u2212G\nC2Vg\n))\n, (4.4)\nf3(G) =\nG\nC3Vg\n, (4.5)\n220 D. L. Bennett and S. A.
