Some of these methods\nmight be fairly described as \u2018new\u2019 techniques that have\nbeen developed specifically for the purpose of conducting\nsynthesis, while others might more properly be seen as\nadaptations of approaches that were originally intended\nfor primary research [2]. Framework analysis is one of the\nlatter. Developed during the 1980s by the UK-based\nNational Centre for Social Research, and explicitly\noriented towards applied policy questions, framework ana-\nlysis is a matrix-based method involving the construction\nof thematic categories into which data can be coded [3].\nOne important feature of the approach is that, unlike\nsome other qualitative methods, it allows themes or con-\ncepts identified a priori to be specified as coding categories\nfrom the outset, and to be combined with other themes or\nconcepts that emerge de novo by subjecting the data to\ninductive analysis. A practical benefit of doing this is that\nit enables questions or issues identified in advance by var-\nious stakeholders (such as policymakers, practitioners, or\nuser groups) to be explicitly and systematically considered\nin the analysis, while also facilitating enough flexibility to\ndetect and characterise issues that emerge from the data.\nFramework analysis has become hugely popular as a\nway of conducting analysis of primary qualitative data,\nespecially in areas of healthcare with policy relevance. A\nrecent study, for example, used framework analysis in a\nstudy of mothers\u2019 interpretations of dietary recommen-\ndations [4]. Because the study had been guided by social\nlearning theory, and because the researchers were inter-\nested in comparing dietary beliefs and behaviours across\nsocial classes, the ability of framework analysis to cope\nwith categories specified in advance of the data collec-\ntion made it a very appropriate choice of analytic strat-\negy. A further advantage is the use of charting\ntechniques, which help not only in enhancing the trans-\nparency of coding, but also with teamwork in relation to\nanalysis. Many of the properties that make framework\nanalysis an appealing option for those conducting pri-\nmary research make \u2018framework-based synthesis\u2019 a\npotentially equally attractive option for those seeking to\nconduct a synthesis of studies. A new article by Carroll\net al [5] published this month in BMC Medical Research\nmethodology reports an interesting evolution of the fra-\nmework-based synthesis approach.\nDiscussion\nFramework analysis has previously been adapted for use\nin synthesis of qualitative evidence by Oliver and\nCorrespondence: md11@le.ac.uk\nSocial Science Research Group, Department of Health Sciences, School of\nMedicine, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK\nDixon-Woods BMC Medicine 2011, 9:39\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1741-7015\/9\/39\n\u00a9 2011 Dixon-Woods; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

They employed an iterative process involving\nfamiliarization with the literature, gradually developing a\nconceptual framework based on concepts derived from\nthe review question and the theoretical and empirical lit-\nerature, applying the framework systematically to evi-\ndence from the studies included in the review, and\nconstructing a chart for each key dimension with distilled\nsummaries from all relevant documents. The charts were\nused to map the range and nature of public involvement\nand to find associations between themes. Several benefits\nof this approach were noted by Oliver et al., including\nwidening the scope of the review to include relevant\ntopics identified by lay people, and the creation of data\ndisplays that could be viewed and assessed by people\nother than the primary analyst. Other examples of the\napplication of the framework approach to the conduct of\nsynthesis have now begun to appear, though it is dismay-\ning that these and other syntheses of qualitative evidence\ncontinue to label themselves with the confusing, tautolo-\ngical, and inappropriate term \u2018meta-synthesis\u2019 [7].\nIn the recent BMC Medical Research Methodology\nmanuscript [5], Carroll and colleagues develop the frame-\nwork-based synthesis approach, focusing on the views of\nadults taking chemopreventative agents (such as aspirin\nor vitamins) in an effort to prevent colorectal cancer.\nOne of the novel features of their approach is their use of\na conceptual model that was used as an initial starting\npoint for coding the evidence from 20 studies. This con-\nceptual model was chosen because of its broad applicabil-\nity to the area under review, and the authors did not\nengage in the more lengthy process of model specifica-\ntion that is often more characteristic of framework synth-\nesis. They augmented analysis using this prespecified\nmodel with analysis that was more inductive, and ended\nup generating a revised conceptual model that provided a\n\u2018best fit\u2019 to the evidence reported in the studies they\nreviewed. The revised model included some factors that\nwere absent from the original model, as well as adjust-\nments to factors that had been reported in that model.\nCarroll and colleagues emphasise the advantages of this\nkind of approach when time is short and the demand for\npolicy-relevant evidence is urgent. It enables focusing of\nthe research on the priorities of those commissioning the\nwork, while still leaving some room for finding the \u2018best\nfit\u2019 in the light of what the evidence actually reports. Of\ncourse, like framework analysis for primary research [8]\nthere are downsides of the approach too. Reviewers who\nhave made a hefty investment in an initial conceptual\nmodel may be unconsciously motivated to recover the\nsunk costs of that model, and as a consequence tend to\nneglect evidence that presents a fundamental challenge.\nPutting more time into specifying the model, using a\nwider range of literature, and gaining the views of a wider\nrange of stakeholders may all be important in improving\nthe legitimacy and validity of any ensuring synthesis.\nThere are also the usual risks of framework analysis that it\ncan tend to suppress interpretive creativity, and thus\nreduce some of the vividness of insight seen in the best\nqualitative research. Nonetheless, as Carroll and colleagues\nargue, framework-based synthesis using the \u2018best fit\u2019 strat-\negy is, in the right hands, likely to be a highly pragmatic\nand useful approach for a range of policy urgent questions.\nConclusions\nFramework-based synthesis is an important advance in\nconducting reviews of qualitative synthesis. The \u2018best fit\u2019\nstrategy is a variant of this approach that may be very\nhelpful when policymakers, practitioners or other deci-\nsion makers need answers quickly, and are able to toler-\nate some ambiguity about whether the answer is the\nvery best that could be given.\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that they have no competing interests.\nReceived: 24 March 2011 Accepted: 14 April 2011\nPublished: 14 April 2011\nReferences\n1.
