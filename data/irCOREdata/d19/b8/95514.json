The paper highlights five psycho-social \npreconditions for participation in AIDS projects (knowledge, social spaces for critical \nthinking, a sense of ownership, confidence and appropriate bridging relationships). \nWe believe this framework provides a useful and generalisable way of \nconceptualising the preconditions for effective \u2018participatory competence\u2019 in youth \nprojects beyond the specialist HIV\/AIDS arena. \n \nKeywords: competence, gender, health, HIV\/AIDS, participation, rural youth \n \n \n 1\nIntroduction \n \nYouth participation in community development and civic life is increasingly seen as \nan important condition for democratic renewal and the enhancement of the health and \nwell-being of young people. At the international and national levels, youth \nparticipation in all aspects of life is part of a bundle of human rights directed at young \npeople and is written into international policies and charters (UNICEF 2003).  \n \nHowever, much discussion in the social science literature emphasises the difficulties \nof achieving participation amongst young people (Morsillo and Prilleltensky 2007, \nPerkins et al. 2007). There is also ambivalence about the aims of participation, \nespecially in health promotion. This debate is often framed in terms of the \u2018narrow\u2019 \nand \u2018broad\u2019 prospects for health promotion. In terms of the \u2018narrow\u2019 possibilities, \nyoung people\u2019s participation is seen to improve service delivery through responding \nto their specific needs and concerns. \u2018Broader\u2019 understandings see youth participation \nas leading to empowerment and collective social action in the interests of challenging \nthe processes of their social exclusion (Morsillo and Prilleltensky 2007, Percy-Smith \n2007, Watts and Flanagan 2007). Highlighting the potentially liberating aspects of \nyouth participation Morsillo and Prilleltensky (2007) discuss the \u2018level\u2019 \u2013 individual, \ncommunity or social \u2013 at which transformation can occur, emphasising the difficulties \nof achieving change at the community and social levels.  \n \nHIV\/AIDS is a prominent health issue for young people. Recent studies suggest over \nhalf of those now being infected with HIV\/AIDS are aged between 15 and 24 \n(UNICEF 2002, UNAIDS 2006). Involvement of young people is seen as a \n 2\nprecondition for successful HIV\/AIDS management and has become a central pillar of \ninternational AIDS policy (UNGASS 2001, UNICEF 2002, UNAIDS 2006). Closely \nlinked is widespread recognition that for youth struggles against HIV\/AIDS to be \nsuccessful they need to go hand-in-hand with youth social development (Wallerstein \n1992, Campbell, et al. 2005a). \n \nIn South Africa the development of young people is a high priority, paralleling \nincreasing concern for their participation in community development and HIV\/AIDS \nmanagement. South African community development policy emphasises the need for \n\u201cthe active involvement of young people in national development\u2026[and the \nimportance of providing] opportunities for their participation in national, provincial \nand local development programmes.\u201d (South African Government 2002, p. 6) While \nthe National Strategic Plan on HIV\/AIDS and STIs highlights young people as a \nspecific focus area (South African Government 2007).1 Policy rhetoric in South \nAfrica has been translated into practice, with numerous interventions for HIV\/AIDS \nand community development seeking to promote young people\u2019s participation \n(Gallant and Maticka-Tyndale 2004, Campbell et al. 2005a, Parker, W. et al. 2007).  \n \nHowever these comprehensive policies and interventions have not led to a substantial \nreduction in HIV-prevalence amongst young people in South Africa. While HIV-\nprevalence is estimated to be 10.8 percent for the whole population over 2 years old, \n                                                 \n1 There are competing understandings of what age groups constitute youth In South Africa youth are \ncommonly seen as being between 14 and 35. While in the international literature on HIV\/AIDS, 15-24 \nis more common. We follow the broader understanding in line with community perceptions of youth in \nour case study site. And while this leads to some problems of comparability between a 14 year-old \nschool girl and 35 year-old man, many issues that emerged in our research are linked to their broader \ncategorisation as \u2018youth\u2019 rather than \u2018adults\u2019.  \n 3\nfor young people specifically (15-24) it is 10.3 percent, with a huge variation between \nmales at 4.4 percent and females at 16.9 percent in this age group (HSRC 2005).  \n \nMany reviews mention the challenges of ensuring meaningful youth participation in \nsocial development projects (Campbell and Foulis, 2002). This paper contributes an \nunderstanding of why interventions may battle to effect the optimal participation of \nyoung people. We do this through an in-depth case study examining how the social \nenvironment of a particular community actively facilitated or hindered young people\u2019s \nparticipation in HIV\/AIDS activities.  \n \nIn earlier work in South Africa we highlighted the way that social environments \nactively shaped the nature and form of youth participation in a HIV\/AIDS peer-\neducation programme (Campbell et al. 2005a). The research was conducted as a final \nevaluation into a peer-education programme. We argued that a variety of factors, \nincluding the pathologisation of youth sexuality and poverty as well as patchy \nnetworking amongst NGOs and local community leaders were crucial in undermining \nthe participation of young people in the programme.  \n \nThis paper builds on these arguments in two ways. Firstly it focuses on a rural context \nin contrast to the peri-urban context of the previous research. In South Africa, rural \nareas provide substantially different living conditions to urban and peri-urban areas \nand a substantial proportion \u2013 43 percent \u2013 of young people aged 14-35 live in rural \nareas (Sekwati and Hirschowitz 2001). Secondly, the earlier study focused on a cross-\nsectional study of an already completed programme, run by one organisation. In \ncomparison, the current study draws on longitudinal process research into a three-year \n 4\nresearch and intervention project that explicitly sought to encourage youth \nparticipation, leadership and development in a broader HIV\/AIDS management \nproject involving multiple community groups and external agencies. \n \nEntabeni Project case study \n \nThe case study is drawn from a community-led HIV\/AIDS intervention in Entabeni a \ncommunity in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The community is approximately \n30km from the nearest town and health facilities. There are high levels of poverty and \nilliteracy in the community and TB and cholera are common (Barron et al. 2006). \nEstimates of HIV-prevalence in the community suggest that 1 in 4 adults are living \nwith HIV\/AIDS (HEARD 2005). The area is tightly controlled by a traditional chief \n(the Inkosi) who delegates power downwards through local traditional leaders \n(Indunas). As in much of South Africa, there is also an elected local government, \u2018the \nmunicipality\u2019, whose power structures run parallel to the Inkosi, but the municipality \ndoes not wield much influence in the community.2\n \nLife for young people in Entabeni is difficult. While school enrolment is high, at \napproximately 93 percent, the burdens of a growing HIV\/AIDS epidemic and high \nlevels of poverty mean many young people do not finish school (Horizons 2004). \nAfter leaving school, lots of young people move to urban areas in search of jobs. \nOthers remain in the community undertaking small amounts of work where they exist. \n \n                                                 \n2 The provincial Department of Local Government and Traditional Affairs is the closest sphere of \ngovernment to communities. They have district municipalities that are responsible for development \nplanning in communities. These are further sub-divided into local municipalities, one of which services \nEntabeni. \n 5\nOur case study of youth participation is taken from a larger on-going project, which \naims to strengthen local community responses to AIDS (Campbell et al. 2005b, \nCampbell et al. 2007a). The Entabeni Project was initiated as a partnership between \nthe Centre for HIV\/AIDS Networking (HIVAN) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal \nand the community following two years of in-depth research into community \nresponses to HIV\/AIDS and following dissemination workshops at which a joint \nproject was formulated between the community and HIVAN (Campbell et al. 2007a, \nCampbell et al. submitted a). \n \nThe Project has three main aspects. First, training and supporting home-based carers. \nSecond, developing volunteer support structures in the community. And third, \nbuilding supportive networks between outside agencies and the community to support \nthe community and specifically the home-based carers. A key goal of the project was \nto maximise the involvement of young people in all project activities. This paper will \nfocus on the youth dimension of this broader Project.3\n \nIn this regard, the Project\u2019s particular aims were to maximise young people\u2019s \ninvolvement in HIV-prevention and AIDS-care management activities and use these \nas a \u2018springboard\u2019 for the wider social development of young people. Initial baseline \ninterviews conducted prior to the establishment of the Project showed young people \nwere a vital and untapped resource in the community and expressed great interest in \ninvolvement in the Project (Campbell et al. 2008).  \n \n                                                 \n3 The wider project \u2013 within which the youth focus was one component \u2013 is discussed in greater detail \nin Campbell et al. (2007a), Campbell et al. (2007b), Nair and Campbell (2008), Campbell et al. (2008), \nCampbell et al. (submitted a) and Campbell et al. (submitted b)  \n 6\nThree activities emerged that directly engaged young people. The first was a youth \nrally, conceived by young people and adult Project participants as a way to raise the \nissue of HIV\/AIDS in a manner that would relate to young people. It included \ndancing, music and motivational speeches. While the rally was successful, attracting \nover 800 people, its effectiveness was limited by the dominance of two adult males on \nthe organising committee. They insisted the rally promote sexual abstinence, rather \nthan condoms. As a result, the message of the rally failed to engage with sexually \nactive young people who were most in need of input (Campbell et al. 2007a).  \n \nThe second component involved training young people in skills to deliver peer-\neducation and counselling. This training was provided by an external NGO through a \nlink facilitated by the Project. At the outset, the training proved very popular amongst \nyoung people. Over time, a number of factors undermined the training\u2019s effectiveness. \nSome who completed the training, and were awarded certificates, left the community \nhoping to use the certificates as a way to secure paid employment or further education \n\u2013 rather than remaining in the community to provide peer-education and counselling, \nas had been the aim of the training. Many others dropped out and simply did not \ncomplete the training. Of those that completed the training, few actively used their \nnew skills in the community. Again, the Project\u2019s efforts to promote the involvement \nof young people in local HIV\/AIDS management had a disappointing outcome.  \n \nThe final aspect revolved around supporting young people to become more involved \nin the public life of the community. This involved ensuring that there was substantial \nyouth representation on Project committees such as the Entabeni Health Partnership \n 7\nCommittee which consisted of local Entabeni residents and external health and \nwelfare agencies and supported the Entabeni Project  (Campbell et al. 2007a).,  \n \nIn addition, the HIVAN Project team supported these young women and men leaders, \nthrough providing regular telephone contact with them during which we discussed \nproblems they were facing. The Project also strove to provide the young leaders with \nopportunities to broaden their skills and horizons through participating in activities \noutside of the community, such as attending relevant conferences and further \nHIV\/AIDS training, to build their knowledge and their confidence.  \n \nThis training, skills building and support has lead to young people becoming more \ninvolved in Entabeni-based structures and organisations developed as part of our \nfacilitation of local responses to HIV\/AIDS. However, while young people were \ninvolved in these structures they often struggled to be meaningfully involved, \nexpressing frustration at their \u2018tokenistic\u2019 inclusion. Overall the engagement and \nparticipation of the young people in the Project has been lacklustre and disappointing, \nespecially given their initial enthusiasm.  \n \nTheory\/framework \n \nThe research we report in the remainder of this paper took the form of a longitudinal \nstudy of the three-year Entabeni AIDS Project. This was process research, and one of \nits key goals was to track and explore macro-social factors shaping the extent to \nwhich young women and men did or did not become involved in the Project. As such \nthis paper is not an evaluation of the Entabeni Project and its attempts to facilitate \n 8\nyouth participation per se, but rather explores how the broader social environment \nhindered and\/or facilitated youth participation in community responses to HIV\/AIDS, \nof which the Entabeni Project was one. \n \nOur concern with understanding the nature of the participation of young people is \nframed within the growing body of work focusing on the social context of HIV\/AIDS \ntransmission and interventions which seek to challenge these drivers (Tawil et al. \n1995, Waldo and Coates 2000, Parker, R. et al. 2000). While the social context of \nHIV\/AIDS in South Africa is well understood (Campbell 2003, UNAIDS 2006), there \nare few understandings of the pathways through which structural factors come to \nhinder young people\u2019s participation in HIV\/AIDS management.  An understanding of \nthese pathways opens up the possibility of designing more effective participatory \ninterventions. \n \nIn an earlier paper we characterised the social environments in which HIV\/AIDS \nprogrammes are carried out in terms of three interacting dimensions (Campbell, et al. \n2005a). The first dimension, the symbolic context, refers to the web of social \nrepresentations through which young people understand issues and translate new \ninformation about HIV\/AIDS (Parker, R. 2001). This includes understandings around \ngender, HIV-related stigma and sexuality. The second dimension is the material-\npolitical context, including poverty, inequality and the nature of political \nrepresentation. The final dimension is the organisational-network context of the \ncommunity, such as the role played by the public and private sectors and civil society \norganisations to create a supportive environment for youth HIV\/AIDS prevention. \n 9\nThese three dimensions are crucial in shaping the social environment from which \nyouth participation in HIV\/AIDS management flows. (Campbell et al. 2005a) \n \nMethods \n \nThe data are drawn from a large corpus of interviews, focus-groups and fieldworker \ndiaries. In total the corpus amounts to around 105 in-depth semi-structured interviews \n\u2013 including interviews with young people, church leaders, teachers, government \nofficials, home-based caregivers and local leaders, 52 focus-group discussions (with a \ntotal of 313 participants)  including, young men and women, home-based carers, local \nteachers in the community and traditional leaders (Indunas). It also included \nfieldworker diaries kept by HIVAN Project workers.  \n \nParticipants were very keen to talk about HIV\/AIDS and the community they lived in. \nIndividual in-depth interviews were often over one-hour long, with focus-groups \nbetween one hour and two hours in length. All interviews were conducted in Zulu and \nrecorded. They were then translated and transcribed into English for analysis.  \n \nThe coding frame for our data was guided by Campbell\u2019s five dimensional concept of \nthe AIDS-competent community (Campbell et al. 2005b). This provides a five-factor \nconceptualisation of factors most likely to facilitate community participation in \nHIV\/AIDS management. The five factors considered are: HIV\/AIDS knowledge, safe \nsocial spaces to engage in dialogue about this knowledge with liked and trusted peers, \na sense of ownership of the problem of AIDS, a sense of confidence in individual and \ncommunity resources to contribute to tackling it, and the existence of bridging social \n 10\ncapital.  Regarding these five dimensions as preconditions for effective participation, \nour data analysis sought to examine the extent to which these five dimensions did or \ndid not exist in relation to the young people of Entabeni, in order to throw light on \nwhy youth participation in the programme did or did not happen.  \n \nIn this regard, data were then subjected to thematic content analysis (Flick 1992) \nusing these five factors as the core categories for the coding frame. The results are \npresented below and the core categories are further elaborated.  \n \nResults \n \nKnowledge and skills \n \nYoung people in Entabeni had good basic knowledge about HIV\/AIDS, which is a \nprecondition for involvement in HIV\/AIDS management. However, a range of factors \nmade it difficult for the young men and women to act on the information they had.  \n \nMany young people held alternative views about sex that contradicted mainstream \nmessages around safe sex. Many of the youth told us that contrary to adult views they \nwere sexually active. They told us how they did not use condoms, alternating between \narguing that condoms reduced the pleasure of sex and the naturalness and inevitability \nof death in their community. One young woman, who was also a home-based carer in \nthe community, suggested that other young people felt they should not use condoms \nbecause it ruined the pleasure of sex: \n \n 11\nThoko (F): They have this belief that they cannot eat a sweet in its wrapper. (HOME-BASED \nCARER)4\n \nSome adults also recognised the competing pressures on young people around sex and \ncondom use. A female traditional leader, reflecting on why she thought young men \nand women did not use condoms, suggested that while they had a lot of information \nabout HIV\/AIDS, they were also keen to experiment and so did not use condoms:  \n \nMs Ndawo (F): I think young people are saturated with information about HIV\/AIDS. They \nfeel they have enough information and they get bored when they are pestered about it. Some \nare afraid to hear about it because they know they still want to experiment about sex. So \nthey\u2019d rather not know about it then to lose out on the experimentation. (INDUNA) \n \nIn interviews, young people also mentioned other issues that hindered their use of \ncondoms. Many of them highlighted how the notion of \u2018trust\u2019 between partners meant \nthat neither women nor men were keen to use condoms because they symbolised a \nlack of trust between partners and therefore a sign of unfaithfulness in the \nrelationship. As a group of school-going young men said: \n \nSibusiso (M): The girl will ask whether you want to use a condom because you don\u2019t trust her. \nThis is the question that many boys have been asked by their girlfriends. The boys stop using \ncondoms after they have asked that because they feel embarrassed to use a condom because \nthey trust their partners. They promise each other that if it happens a girl gets a sexual disease \nit would mean she got from her partner and vice versa. Young people don\u2019t like to use \ncondoms - both males and females. There are those who use condom consistently. Others they \nuse condom to other partner and don\u2019t use it to other partner.  \nInterviewer: In what situation where they use condom and don\u2019t use it to other partner?  \n                                                 \n4 All quotes are structured \u2013 Name (sex, M \u2013 male, F \u2013 female): Quote. (Position in the community)  \n 12\nJabulani (M): There are girls who say, \u201cIf you want to have sex with me you will not use \ncondom.\u201d There are also those girls who say that you have to use condom if you want to have \nsex with her. This is confusing, because you have to think if she says no to using a condom \nshe really means it and vice versa.  \nInterviewer: What have you done in those situations?  \nJabulani (M): We do as the girl says. Because if she tells you not to use a condom it means \nthere feelings of trust between the two of you have developed. The girls that say \u201cyou must \nuse a condom\u201d are the ones where there is no trust. (SCHOOL-GOING MALES) \n \nIn addition to questions of trust and curiosity there was also the real issue that many \nyoung people found it difficult to access condoms in Entabeni. One young male \ndescribed how he got condoms from the mobile clinic, which came once a month, and \nif he had run out of condoms, he still wanted to have sex: \n \nNdoda (M): I use condom but sometimes I \u2018break the law\u2019 when I don\u2019t have any. I can\u2019t wait \nfor mobile clinic and clinics are too far from here. This is the situation that forces us not using \ncondoms. (SCHOOLBOY)  \n \nAs such while young men and women demonstrated extensive knowledge about \nHIV\/AIDS their ability to act on this to protect themselves in sexual relationships was \nlimited by competing demands \u2013 such as their curiosity with sex and the need to \ndevelop emotional trust with their partners. Furthermore, from a practical point of \nview, access to condoms in this relatively remote community was highly restricted, \neven for those who wished to use them. \n \n 13\nSafe social spaces \nThere is an increasing recognition of the importance of spaces in which peers can talk \nabout new and alien information if they are to integrate it into their everyday lives and \nact on it (Low-Beer and Stoneburner 2004, UNDP 2005, Epstein 2007, Campbell et \nal. submitted a). Where such spaces existed in Entabeni young people were keen to \ntalk about issues that affected them. One teacher reported that given the opportunity to \ntalk about sex, young people were very keen to: \n \nMs Zama (F): What I can say is that when children are given a chance to talk about sex, they \nbecome comfortable. I am not sure whether it is the topic that interests them. They like \ndiscussion topics that are not necessarily in line with their curriculum...What I am trying to \nsay is that children enjoy discussing sexual issues. I am not sure whether they are tickled by \nsuch discussion, but the fact is that they are fascinated by such discussions and they are open \nabout them. (SCHOOL TEACHER) \n \nSocial spaces existed for young people to talk openly about HIV\/AIDS and sex were \nfew and far between in Entabeni. In a conservative traditional community strong \nsocial norms and inhibitions prohibited talk about sex, especially sex amongst young \nmen and women. \n \nThis was the case in schools. While Ms Zama said she was willing to discuss \nHIV\/AIDS and sex openly in school classes, other teachers were not, saying that \nchildren who did talk about HIV\/AIDS and sex in classes were \u2018naughty\u2019 \u2013 essentially \nmaking a distinction between \u2018good\u2019 children who did not speak about sex nor have \nsex and \u2018naughty\u2019 children who broke rules and had sex: \n \n 14\nMr Ndosi (M): Then we looked in class at sexually transmitted diseases and the signs that are \nshown with those diseases and how to prevent those diseases.  \nInterviewer: So how do the pupils respond to this, when you do life-orientation classes? Do \nthey feel free to talk about these issues?  \nMr Ndosi (M): Yes, they do talk, but it\u2019s only the naughty ones that talk about sex. (SCHOOL \nTEACHER) \n \nDuring a discussion the HIVAN Project team had with the Entabeni high school \nprincipal about HIV\/AIDS, sex and HIV\/AIDS education, he said that learners at his \nschool had no need for AIDS education because Entabeni was a conservative \ncommunity and sex outside of marriage did not occur.  \n \nMany young people said that when they tried to talk to their parents about HIV\/AIDS \nand sex, their parents tended to only talk about \u2018good behaviour\u2019 or abstinence as the \narea\u2019s traditional chief (the Inkosi ) had instructed parents to do: \n \nInterviewer: Are young people able to talk freely to their parents or adults in this community \nabout HIV\/AIDS?  \nSindi (F): The Inkosi is forever calling on mothers to address the youth and talk to them about \ngood behaviour and not involving themselves in sex. (YOUNG PERSON) \n \nThe prevailing assumption amongst powerful adults (such as the school principal, the \nInkosi and many parents) was that children did not have sex before they were married. \nFor this reason many adults and parents chose not to talk about condoms, only \nreinforcing \u2018abstinence only\u2019 messages around HIV\/AIDS. This approach denied the \nreality that many young people were having sex:  \n \n 15\nInterviewer: Do people know about using condoms in this community?  \nZanele (F): No they don\u2019t. They [adults] don\u2019t talk about condoms to young people, because \nthey don\u2019t expect young people to have sex. (SCHOOLGIRL) \n \nInterviewer: You say you take condoms and make your thing, do you mean that you are not \nallowed to have sex or do you mean sex is only for married people?  \nJabulani (M): Sex is not meant for young people. But it happens that young people have sex, \nbut adults say sex is only for adults. I don\u2019t think that young people can stop having sex. \n(SCHOOLBOY) \n \nThe denial of youth sexuality by many parents was also buttressed by a resurgence of \ntraditional practices advocated by the Inkosi in the community, reinforcing this \napproach. The Inkosi promoted virginity testing and participation for young women in \nthe \u2018Reed Ceremony\u2019, where all participants are checked to ensure their virginity, as \none adult described: \n \nThembi (F): There was a meeting in the hall where the Inkosi was telling us to educate our \nchildren about how they should behave themselves. He also told us to encourage our children \nto attend Umkhosi womhlanga [Reed Ceremony]. I can say that he plays a role in supporting \nhealth behave to our children in this community.  \nInterviewer: Does he talk about HIV\/AIDS?  \nThembi (F): He educates us about AIDS especially to our children. He told us to educate our \nchildren to behave themselves. He said we must not be afraid to talk to our children because \nwe thought they are still young to talk about this issue. He said we must tell them that if they \nhave sex with boys they will get infected with AIDS. (HOME-BASED CARER) \n \nDenying the sexuality of young people, as parents and the Inkosi tended to do, by \npromoting abstinence only approaches when discussing sex and HIV\/AIDS with \n 16\nyoung people, can be seen as part of broader attempts by adults to reassert their \nauthority over youth especially young women (Campbell et al. 2007b, Leclerc-\nMadlala 2001). This approach failed to resonate with young people who admitted that \nthey were sexually active and so needed spaces to learn about condoms and discuss \nthese issues, which their parents were unwilling to do.  \n \nThere was a general lack of activities specifically for young people in the community \nwhich may have lead to the emergence of organic social spaces in which they could \ntalk about HIV\/AIDS and sex, without adults setting the terms of the discussion. \nYoung women appeared particularly restricted in their abilities to access such spaces, \noften being expected to complete housework after school, before starting homework \nor extracurricular activity, as one school girl described:  \n \nNomfundo (F): We have to do our chores before we are allowed to do homework, this \nis a hard situation (SCHOOLGIRL) \n \nAnd few extra-curricula activities were available to young women apart from the \nchurch, as one home-based carer pointed out when discussing the lack of young \nwomen participating in community activities: \n \nNomandla (F): Young girls are not allowed to get involved in any community activities aside \nfrom church (HOME-BASED CARER) \n \nOverall, there appeared few spaces in which young people could discuss HIV\/AIDS \nand sex openly \u2013 undermining the likelihood that they would translate what \nknowledge they did have into life skills \u2013 in ways that resonated with their own social \n 17\nand sexual identities, and that were practically feasible given the realities of their \nlives.  \n \nThe few social opportunities that did exist for young people to discuss AIDS and sex \ntended to be framed by the assumption that \u2018young people do not have sex\u2019. The \ndominant form of AIDS-education \u2013 supported by the very powerful Inkosi \u2013 was to \npromote abstinence. Such approaches denied the reality that many young men and \nwomen were sexually active, making this educational message inappropriate for them, \nwith little value for protecting their sexual health. In addition, in settings dominated \nby highly judgemental views about HIV\/AIDS and about youth sexuality \u2013 which \ndeny the realities of young people\u2019s lives \u2013 it is unlikely that young people will feel \ndrawn to participate in HIV\/AIDS interventions.  \n \nOwnership of the issue \n \nFor young people to become involved in HIV\/AIDS management, it is necessary that \nthey have a sense of ownership of the problem. The fear, denial and stigma \nsurrounding HIV\/AIDS are all linked to the lack of people\u2019s willingness to take \nownership of the issue (Campbell et al. 2005b). In Entabeni, there were high levels of \nfatalism around HIV\/AIDS \u2013 many young men and women referred to HIV\/AIDS as a \n\u2018death sentence\u2019. In one focus-group with out-of-school youth voluntary counselling \nand testing (VCT) for HIV\/AIDS was discussed, most of the young men and women \ninvolved suggested that there was no point in being tested, as there was no cure: \n \nSimanga (M): This is just a way of hastening death because already you know that this disease \nis incurable. You are going to die anyway. This is how I feel. \n 18\nInterviewer: Don\u2019t you see the danger that a positive person can infect others if she is not \naware of his\/her status? \nSimanga (M): Telling other people about one\u2019s status won\u2019t change anything. One will die \nanyway.  \nNtombenhle (F): I disagree. Telling other people can encourage them to live positively and \nuse condoms. Even if they have this disease, they will still live longer. (OUT OF SCHOOL \nYOUNG PEOPLE) \n \nOne young person, who was also a home-based carer in the community, reflected on \nthe sheer scale of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic in the community: \n \nBusi (F): If a young person has been sent to hospital here, he does not live. They all die. We \nalways talk about death these days. It is frightening. (HOME-BASED CARER) \n \nSuch fatalism in people\u2019s approaches to HIV\/AIDS \u2013 while partly driven by the lack \nof effective treatment and response to HIV\/AIDS at the national level \u2013 also hindered \nthe likelihood that young people would see HIV\/AIDS prevention as an issue where \nthey could exercise effective agency. \n \nYoung people frequently spoke of high levels of HIV\/AIDS stigma in the community. \nBeing associated with a friend or family member who was known to be living with \nHIV\/AIDS, or admitting to living with HIV\/AIDS oneself was likely to be difficult \nfor young people in this community, because of the views people had about \nHIV\/AIDS, linking people living with HIV\/AIDS to being immoral:  \n \nZanele (F): But here you can\u2019t walk with an HIV positive person.  \nInterviewer: Where?  \n 19\nZanele (F): I mean here. You cannot be seen walking with a positive person in this \ncommunity. They are highly stigmatised. (SCHOOLGIRL) \n \nNkululeko (M): If I\u2019m sick and go to hospital and then diagnosed HIV-positive, it will be very \ndifficult for me to disclose my status, because the community would see me as bad person.  \nInterviewer: Why is that so?  \nNkululeko (M): They will think that I was sleeping around. (SCHOOLBOY) \n \nSuch was the stigma in Entabeni surrounding HIV\/AIDS that many people refused to \nadmit that either they, or a person they knew, were living with HIV\/AIDS.  Our \nresearch suggests that key drivers of the lack of ownership of the problem of \nHIV\/AIDS amongst young people in the community were high levels of fatalism, \nstigma and unwillingness by people to admit they or someone they knew was living \nwith HIV\/AIDS. Such lack of ownership undermined the likelihood that young people \nwould be motivated to participate in local responses to HIV\/AIDS. \n \nConfidence \n \nLinked closely to a sense of ownership, the fourth dimension of the AIDS Competent \nCommunity is a sense of confidence that one can make a meaningful contribution to \ntackling the issue (Campbell et al. 2005b). In high levels of marginalisation and \npoverty, people may feel unable to respond to issues, choosing instead to wait for \nexternal assistance (Sliep and Meyer-Weitz 2003, Barnett and Whiteside 2006).  \n \nIn Entabeni a range of factors undermined young people\u2019s confidence that they could \nmake a difference and therefore limited their willingness to become involved in the \n 20\nProject. A prominent theme underlying young people\u2019s lack of confidence to act, as in \nour earlier study in a peri-urban community, was that they were typically seen by \nadults as \u2018mad, bad and deviant\u2019 (Campbell et al. 2005a), with little to offer the \ncommunity. This was also the case in Entabeni. As one older community member put \nit: \n \nMr Khumalo (M): Young people want money but they don\u2019t want to work. They want money \nfor buying dagga [cannabis] and drinking alcohol. Young people are not good at all. (OLDER \nMAN) \n \nYoung people recognised that the negative perceptions of them held by adults meant \nthat they were often not invited to be involved in community activities, even though \nthey felt that they had a lot to offer the community: \n \nInterviewer: What is the biggest problem that causes this gap between parents and youth?  \nKhehla (M): Parents don\u2019t trust us. They think we are useless children. We youth always talk \nabout our parents and older people that are involved in community matters. There are times \nwhen we realise that if young people were involved things could have moved faster and better. \n(OUT OF SCHOOL YOUNG PERSON) \n \nIn Entabeni, poverty also meant that many young people were more concerned about \nfinding work than becoming involved in HIV\/AIDS management. One female \ntraditional councillor, reflecting on the lack of youth involvement in the community \nmore widely, emphasised that they were pre-occupied with finding employment, \nrather than becoming involved in the local community: \n \n 21\nMs Ndawo (F): Another reason for youth reluctance to participate is that when young people \nfinish high school, they are desperate to find work. So if you keep asking them to attend things \nthat won\u2019t bring any money, they resist that. (INDUNA) \n \nThis was closely linked to the fact that even in this fairly remote community there was \na growing awareness that young people \u2013 especially men \u2013 were part of a materialistic \nglobal world where effort should be rewarded. Voluntary work, the basis of the \nHIV\/AIDS management Project, offered no such rewards. \n \nBut the lack of young people\u2019s interest in volunteering in community projects was not \nonly linked to the immediate lack of rewards, it also stemmed from their perceptions \nthat the concept of volunteering had been \u2018abused\u2019 in the past by adults. Young men \ntold us how they were often expected to provide free labour for community projects, \nbut whenever there were material rewards available for work, adults \u2018muscled in\u2019 and \nthey were systematically excluded: \n \nSimanga (M): Youth are excluded from opportunities for paid work because we are told we \nare too young. But when it comes to voluntary work we are always called in. (OUT OF \nSCHOOL YOUNG PERSON) \n \nSandile (M): The Induna sent us on a road-building course to qualify us for volunteering for \nroad construction. However as soon as he realised the work would be paid, he stopped us from \ngoing to get the work, and he and his son took our places. (YOUNG MAN) \n \nFor young people in the community therefore, the lack of cash rewards for \nvolunteering, linked to the way volunteering had been abused in the past in the \ncommunity, meant few had the confidence to engage in further voluntary work. Past \n 22\nexperience had suggested that they would be excluded from work that led to cash \nrewards at any point. \n \nDespite these factors militating against youth participation in the public life of \nEntabeni and in the Project, a small number of young people did nevertheless become \ninvolved. However, many of them emphasised that their participation in community \nstructures was tokenistic, to give the appearance of the participation of young people, \nrather than real involvement: \n \nInterviewer: You said there is no communication between adults and youth, but at the same \ntime you say youth are represented in committees. \nNkululeko (M): They include youth in committees, but they don\u2019t involve them if they are \ngoing to government departments for help. Young people end up doing nothing meaningful \nbecause adults aren\u2019t empowering them with skills and knowledge. Adults are the ones who \nend up taking the role of youth when there is real work to be done. It just tokenistic that youth \nare represented on committees. (SCHOOLBOY) \n \nAnd when young people did try and speak up, adult responses reinforced their belief \nthat adults did not want them to be involved in the community: \n \nQinisani (M): They give young people positions on committees, but then adults don\u2019t listen to \nyoung people\u2019s views. If we young people say something adults think it\u2019s either illogical or \nwe are undermining them. (YOUNG PERSON) \n \nYoung people repeatedly regretted the way in which their minimal and tokenistic \ninvolvement in committees and the public life of the community denied them skills \ndevelopment, simply reinforcing their marginal status in the community. Given the \n 23\nhigh levels of material and symbolic marginalisation of young people in Entabeni, \nmany of them had little confidence that they could make a difference around \nHIV\/AIDS.  \n \nBridging relationships \n \nIn the context of high levels of poverty and the burden of a widespread HIV\/AIDS \nepidemic, grassroots community projects to tackle HIV\/AIDS are most likely to be \nsuccessful when they are supported by external organisations with access to material \nand symbolic resources to assist projects in achieving their goals (Evans 1996, Gillies \n1998, Campbell, 2003). Such organisations may derive from the public and private \nsectors and\/or civil society. Bridging relationships with agencies outside the \ncommunity were very limited in Entabeni. In terms of health services, while there was \na monthly mobile clinic, young preferred the local hospitals in the face of the lack of \nprivacy available at the clinic. However these were 30km away, and transport money \nwas often scarce.  They also complained about the low service standards provided by \nthe clinic (Campbell et al. 2008). Apart from this, young women and men had very \nlittle access to health care within the community. \n \nOther government services for young people were also quite limited. While the \nDepartment of Education did have a number of schools in the area, those seeking \ntertiary education had to leave the community and live elsewhere. But with high \nlevels of unemployment and poverty in the area many did not manage to complete \ntheir secondary education, either because they were forced to leave school to look for \n 24\nwork, or because they saw no future for themselves either with or without schooling \n(Sibanda 2004). \n  \nNGO involvement in Entabeni, specifically for youth, was very limited. A number of \npeople told us of how external NGOs would visit Entabeni to put HIV\/AIDS posters \nup around schools. But teachers reported that these posters had little impact: \n  \nMr Mfeka (M): We do have posters that inform learners about HIV\/AIDS in our schools. It is \na pity that they don\u2019t really have any impact as kids just look at them and go away. \n(TEACHER) \n \nOverall, bridging relationships to support the involvement of young people in \nHIV\/AIDS management in Entabeni were very constrained. Civil society and \ngovernment, while they tried to provide some form of support for young people, were \ngenerally overstretched and lacked the resources and skills necessary to provide such \nsupport (Campbell et al. 2008).  In such situations, any indigenous organisations for \nyoung people in Entabeni had few opportunities for eliciting support from outside \ngroupings, which might have been crucial in bringing about more effective youth \nparticipation in HIV\/AIDS management. \n \nDiscussion\/Conclusion \n \nThis section has two aims. Firstly we seek to synthesise our views of the way in \nwhich social factors undermined our Project\u2019s goal of youth participation. Here we \nwill distinguish between structural factors which lie beyond the scope of local social \ndevelopment programmes, and potentially actionable factors which we believe might \n 25\nusefully and realistically be tackled by future youth participatory projects. Secondly \nwe seek to flag up the usefulness of our five-dimension AIDS competence framework \nfor highlighting the psycho-social preconditions for effective participation, suggesting \nthat this framework may have use beyond the specialist HIV\/AIDS arena \u2013 helping \npeople to understand factors most likely to facilitate youth participation a wider range \nof projects. \n \nThe Entabeni Project did indeed put in place a number of important structures to \npromote participation in the Project amongst young people in the community. The \nProject worked hard to ensure that activities it ran resonated with the lived \nexperiences of young people \u2013 through promoting condoms and recognising that \nyoung people were sexually active \u2013 in opposition to the views of many adults in the \ncommunity (Campbell et al. 2007a). It also provided social spaces in which young \npeople could talk openly about HIV\/AIDS and reflect on what they could do to \nchallenge it (Campbell et al. submitted a).  \n \nYet as this paper has argued these positive actions by the Project were undermined by \nwider social factors that constrained young people\u2019s participation in the Project. To \nsome extent structural barriers are beyond the scope of small projects such as this \n(Kumar and Corbridge, 2002). Poverty and unemployment constitute structural \nbarriers of this nature. While the Project attempted to increase access to grants for \nhome-based carers and the wider community, grant uptake was still relatively low. \nSimilarly, the role of AIDS-related stigma in hindering youth participation in the \nProject was also recognised by the Entabeni Project from early on. The Project went \nto great lengths to challenge stigma \u2013 through providing HIV\/AIDS information, \n 26\nensuring quality care for people living with HIV\/AIDS from home-based carers and \nincreasing access to government hospitals and clinics \u2013 however it remained a serious \nbarrier to the participation of young people. As such some structural barriers are very \ndifficult, if not impossible, for small projects such as this to challenge.  \n \nHowever, we believe that some of the barriers which hindered youth participation in \nthe Project could have potentially been overcome. Firstly, the importance of adults in \nundermining youth participation was a major barrier which future projects might seek \nto tackle far more explicitly than we did. Other studies have emphasised the \nimportance of adults in facilitating or hindering youth participation (Mchakulu 2007), \nbut have implied that creating structures in which adults support youth participation is \nrelatively simple (Messias et al. 2005). Yet, as our case study demonstrated adult \nperceptions of youth as lazy, and as inferior to adults, hindered youth involvement, as \ndid adult denial of youth sexuality. In contexts where adults are highly marginalised, \ntheir power over youth might be one of the few areas where they can demonstrate \nauthority (Campbell, 1992), a situation which probably feeds into their negative \nstereotypes of youth. Recognising and tackling the inter-linked nature of the \nmarginalisation of adults and the marginalisation of young people is therefore crucial \nif the empowerment of young people is to be a reality. Those seeking to put \nparticipatory programmes in place need to work very hard with adults to ensure they \nrecognise the value of youth inputs and accept youth as legitimate equals in such \nprogrammes.  \n \nSecondly, the limited support for youth and youth organisations from external \nagencies was another factor limiting youth participation in HIV\/AIDS management. \n 27\nAgain, while the Project worked hard to encourage external agency involvement in \nthe community, especially around supporting youth, overall the reality has been a lack \nof commitment by external agencies (Nair and Campbell 2008, Campbell et al. \nsubmitted b). Yet external agency support for youth does not necessarily translate into \nyouth participation and indeed can further hinder it if it is excessively bureaucratic or \ninappropriate (Matthews 2001). Programme facilitators need to work hard to ensure \nthat external agencies provide the necessary support to encourage youth participation.  \n \nThe third barrier which could potentially be challenged through small-scale projects is \nthe lack of incentives youth faced to participate. Our research pointed to the way \nvolunteering had previously been commandeered by adults as another way to exploit \nyouth labour. Incentives in previous projects had been appropriated by adults in the \npast. We would argue that in order to succeed in ensuring youth engagement, projects \nsuch as ours need to put meaningful and long-term incentives into place. Cornish \n(2006) argues that  it is vital that participatory projects give marginalised people \nconcrete experiences of exerting their agency \u2013 in ways that are recognised either \nthrough material incentives or meaningful public recognition. Ideally these incentives \nwould be financial, but given the restricted nature of many project budgets, a broader \nunderstanding of incentives is needed. The Entabeni Project did attempt to provide \nyoung people with incentives for participation in the form of training courses, \ncertificates for completing such courses and attendance at national and international \nconferences outside the community \u2013 but still were limited in their effects. Project \nfacilitators need to work hard to define what would count as meaningful incentives for \nyouth in their particular contexts, and also to ensure that such incentives are \nstructured, long-lasting and build confidence.  \n 28\n Therefore we suggest that project facilitators looking to encourage the participation of \nyoung people in HIV\/AIDS management ensure that; (i) they ensure buy-in from \nadults and recognition of youth as legitimate actors, (ii) they build bridging \nrelationships with external agencies, and (iii) ensure that meaningful and ongoing \nincentives are in place. We believe that each of these factors is realistically \nachievable, even in small local projects. \n \nAt the conceptual level, we hope that this paper has illustrated the usefulness of our \nconcept of AIDS competence as a heuristic tool for mapping out\/understanding the \npsycho-social preconditions for effective participation, and the way in which aspects \nof the material, symbolic and institutional environments may facilitate or hinder these. \n \nThe generalisability of case-studies, such as ours, is a controversial issue. While some \nsuggest that it is impossible to generalise from one case-study to another, others, \nincluding ourselves, argue that it generalisability is possible, based on the judgement \nof skilled social scientists\/activists on a case-by-case basis (Flyvbjerg 2001).  We \nhope that our illustration of the way in which we have used the concept of AIDS \ncompetence to investigate the psycho-social processes shaping the possibility of \neffective participation will be useful to colleagues working in other areas besides \nHIV\/AIDS. We believe that our concept of AIDS Competence could be generalised to \nserve as a useful  conceptualisation of Participatory Competence \u2013 and be of use to \nanyone keen to understand how best to optimise youth participation in social \ndevelopment projects. Our research suggests that youth are most likely to participate \nin social development projects when they have the appropriate knowledge, social \n 29\nspaces for critical thinking, a sense of ownership of the problem in question, a sense \nof confidence in their ability to contribute to solving it, and appropriate bridging \nrelationships. Much work remains to be done in expanding our understandings of the \npsycho-social factors that are most likely to enable effective youth participation, and \non how to promote the development of these factors from one situation to the next. \n \n 30\nReferences \n \nBarnett, T. and Whiteside.
