Their unique properties in electrical conduction, chemical robustness \nand the ability to control the growth of aligned CNT films makes them an ideal candidate \nfor high intensity electron sources. Combining \nthese properties with that ability to solubilise \nCNTs within an aqueous solution further \nextends the application fields associated with \nthese unique materials.  \n In this work we will make use of an \nacid oxidised carbon nanotube ink that has \nbeen developed [1] to provide a simple route \nfor controlling threshold fields and the current \ndensity in a three terminal device \nconfiguration. \nThe nanotube ink developed in this \nresearch project has enabled us to demonstrate \nthreshold fields as low as 0.8 V\/\u00b5m, by \ntailoring the underlying substrate morphology. \nFurthermore, lithium functionalisation via a wet-chemistry technique has been used to \ntailor the work function of MWCNTs resulting in even lower threshold fields of 0.25 \nV\/\u00b5m [2]. The inks produced can be inexpensively deposited over large areas (ink jet \nprinting) on a variety of substrates (e.g.: paper, plastic, glass, silicon, etc.). \n The Li+ acid oxidised carbon nanotube ink has been dropped on a piece of filter \npaper, roughly 1 cm2 area and it was then placed to dry on a hot plate for 10 minutes in \norder to evaporate the water. The result was a dark region on the filter paper where the \nnanotubes formed a conducting mat, as can be seen in Figure 1.  Choosing the filter paper \nas the support substrate for the carbon nanotube solution allows us to easily integrate it in \na flexible three terminal device, as will be described.  \nThe three-terminal device was made using a 3x3 cm2 laminating pouch which had \nthe sheet thickness of 125 \u00b5m. One of the sheets of the pouch was covered by a layer of \n100 nm of DC sputtered Au. After the deposition of the Au, a matrix of 4x4 holes was \nmade using a pin to punch through the plastic. Also a channel was cut in the Au covered \nsheet to allow the contacting of the nanotube mat. The paper covered with the nanotube \nmat was placed inside the pouch and then laminated using a conventional office \nlaminator. The resulting structure is sketched in Figure 2. \n Due to the crude manufacturing technique used, only two out of 4 devices could \nbe used for FE testing mainly because of the way the holes were made. The plastic tended \n \nFigure 1 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey. Downloaded on February 17,2010 at 05:05:41 EST from IEEE Xplore.

The carbon nanotube mat \nwas contacted through the channel \npreviously cut, using silver paste \nand it was grounded. The Au gate \nelectrode was kept at a fixed \npotential Vg while the spherical anode placed at 300 \u00b5m distance from the surface had a \npotential Va which was varied in 30 V steps. The data was recorded with the use of a \ncomputer and plotted in Figure 3 for various gate voltages. As it can be seen for the first \ntwo gate voltages there was no \nsignificant current registered at the \nanode. For the rest of the applied \npotentials normal FE curves can be \nseen with a peak current of 5 \u00b5A. In \nthe light of the method used to \nmanufacture this device the results \ncan only be seen as proof of concept \nand intense research is currently \nunder was to improve the device. \n It can be concluded that \nflexible FE devices can be \nmanufactured using a cheap process. \nThese devices can easily be \nintegrated in electronic circuits and \nindependently addressed to create the \nbasis for new generation of flat panel displays. \n \n \nReferences: \n[1] H.
