Replication\norigins are best understood in the budding yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, where several comple-\nmentary studies have mapped their locations\ngenome-wide. We have collated these datasets,\ntaking account of the resolution of each study, to\ngenerate a single list of distinct origin sites. OriDB\nprovides a web-based catalogue of these confirmed\nand predicted S.cerevisiae DNA replication origin\nsites. Each proposed or confirmed origin site\nappears as a record in OriDB, with each record\ncomprising seven pages. These pages provide, in\ntext and graphical formats, the following informa-\ntion: genomic location and chromosome context\nof the origin site; time of origin replication; DNA\nsequence of proposed or experimentally confirmed\norigin elements; free energy required to open the\nDNA duplex (stress-induced DNA duplex destabi-\nlization or SIDD); and phylogenetic conservation of\nsequence elements. In addition, OriDB encourages\ncommunity submission of additional information\nfor each origin site through a User Notes facility.\nOrigin sites are linked to several external resources,\nincluding the Saccharomyces Genome Database\n(SGD) and relevant publications at PubMed.\nFinally, a Chromosome Viewer utility allows users\nto interactively generate graphical representations\nof DNA replication data genome-wide. OriDB is\navailable at www.oridb.org.\nINTRODUCTION\nGenomic stability during cell proliferation demands accurate\nand precise DNA replication and segregation. DNA replica-\ntion initiates at discrete sites, called replication origins.\nThe size of eukaryotic chromosomes requires that they are\nreplicated from multiple replication origins and these origins\nmust be well spaced to ensure that no region is left unrepli-\ncated. Eukaryotic chromosome replication is primarily\ncontrolled at the level of replication origin activation.\nUnderstanding where replication origin sites are located and\nhow these sites are specified is crucial to our understanding\nof DNA replication and genome integrity (1).\nHow eukaryotic replication origins are specified is best\nunderstood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,\nwhere specific sequences that confer origin activity (called\nAutonomously Replicating Sequences or ARS elements)\nhave been isolated. The ability of yeast ARS elements to\nsupport plasmid replication has facilitated the identification\nand analysis of many replication origins in the yeast genome\n(2\u20134). Furthermore, the chromosomal activity of replication\norigins can be analyzed by separating replication inter-\nmediates by either neutral\u2013neutral two-dimensional (2D) gel\nelectrophoresis (5\u20138) or by neutral\u2013alkaline 2D gel electro-\nphoresis (9,10). The neutral\u2013alkaline method, and a modifica-\ntion of the neutral\u2013neutral method (the \u2018fork-direction gel\u2019;\n11) both permit determination of replication fork direction\nand consequently the proportion of cell cycles in which a\nparticular chromosomal replication origin is activated\n(its observed \u2018efficiency\u2019).\nCombining plasmid assays for ARS activity with site-\ndirected mutagenesis has revealed DNA elements required\nfor replication initiation at origin sites. Budding yeast origins\nare almost exclusively intergenic (12) and consist of \u0001200 bp\nsequences that can be divided into the A and B domains\n(Figure 1). The A domain contains an essential ARS consen-\nsus sequence (ACS), variously assigned as 11\u201317 bp in length\nthat is the binding site for the Origin Recognition Complex\n(ORC) (13\u201315). ORC binding is required for the sequential\nrecruitment of Cdc6, Cdt1 and MCM proteins during G1\nto form a \u2018pre-replication complex\u2019 (pre-RC) that \u2018licenses\u2019\nthe origin for initiation in the subsequent S phase (16).\nA match to the ACS is essential but not sufficient for origin\nfunction, with only \u0001500 of the \u000112 000 ACS matches in the\nyeast genome having replication origin function. Therefore\nadditional surrounding sequences and\/or chromatin states\nmust be required to specify whether or not a particular\nACS motif has replication origin function. The B region of\nan origin tends to be helically unstable (having a DUE or\nDNA unwinding element) and additionally contains a number\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The B1 element is thought to con-\ntribute to ORC recruitment (13\u201315); the B2 element resem-\nbles the ACS motif and is required for efficient loading of\nMCM proteins (17\u201319); the B3 element of ARS1 binds the\ntranscription factor Abf1 (20) and excludes nucleosomes\nfrom the core origin sequences (19). Nucleosome exclusion\nis thought to be a general property of replication origins\n(12), however Abf1 does not bind at all origin sites and there-\nfore other mechanisms must also be utilized to exclude\nnucleosomes.\nThe DUE, which overlaps the origin B elements, is\npresumed to facilitate origin unwinding (21,22). Sites where\nthe duplex strands are most easily separated under the topo-\nlogical stresses that occur in vivo, called stress induced\nduplex destabilization (SIDD) sites, have been shown to\ncollocate with replication origins (23). These SIDD sites\nare related to DUE sequences, and are similarly thought to\nfacilitate localized DNA unwinding during the initiation of\nreplication.\nFour microarray-based studies mapped the approximate\nlocation of replication origins throughout the budding yeast\ngenome. Two of these studies were based on measurement\nof the time at which each region of the yeast genome\nreplicates, allowing approximate identification of origin\nsites as the earliest-replicating sequences in their locality\n(24,25). These studies identified origin sites that are\nactive on the chromosome under the conditions analyzed. A\nthird investigation used chromatin immunoprecipitation\n(ChIP) of origin-binding proteins (ORC and Mcm) to identify\nsites with potential origin activity, which were named\nproposed ARS (proARS) sites (26). Fourth, sites of replica-\ntion initiation were mapped genome-wide by measuring\nthe accumulation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in cells\nchallenged with the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea\n(HU) (27). Each of these four studies produced separate\nlists of potential origin sites throughout the budding yeast\ngenome, but none attempted to identify the individual ORC\nbinding sequences (i.e. the ACS elements) [reviewed in\n(1)]. A recent investigation showed that the ACS elements\nof characterized replication origins tend to be phylogeneti-\ncally conserved in closely related Saccharomyces species.\nAnalysis of phylogenetic sequence conservation in likely\norigin regions allowed the genome-wide identification of\nACS locations (termed proposed ACS or proACS) with\nbase-pair resolution (12). In addition, this study confirmed\norigin activity associated with >200 of these proACS\nlocations.\nWe have developed OriDB as a repository of information\nabout S.cerevisiae DNA replication origins. The data used\nto compile OriDB has been collated from the genome-wide\nstudies described above and from single origin studies, and\nOriDB thus brings together information that is currently\ndifficult to access and compare because it has been presented\ndisparately and spans the literature of the past quarter\ncentury. OriDB will provide a valuable resource for those\nworking in the DNA replication field; moreover, by making\nthe available datasets more accessible, the database will\nhelp researchers working in related fields analyze their results\nin relation to replication dynamics.\nDATA COLLATION\nMost of the information in the OriDB database is collated\nfrom four microarray-based studies, each of which produced\na list of proposed origin sites (24\u201327), and a fifth study which\nproduced a list of confirmed origin sites (12). We aimed to\nproduce a single list of unique origin sites that assigns each\norigin location at the highest resolution available. First, it\nwas necessary to develop criteria for OriDB to use in\ndeciding whether closely spaced origin location assignments\nmade by the various studies correspond to the same or distinct\norigins. We began by assessing the resolution of each\nmicroarray-based study by comparing its proposed origin\nlocations with confirmed origin sites (12). Different source\nlists of origin location data were ranked, best first, based\nupon the estimated resolution of their origin location predic-\ntions. The six lists of origin sites used and the error values\nassociated with each study are shown in Table 1.\nThese error values are taken into account by OriDB in\ndeciding whether origins predicted by two different studies\nare the same. If origin location assignments overlap once\nappropriate errors are added, OriDB considers the assign-\nments to represent a single origin. For example, origin\nsites identified by Raghuraman et al. (List 6) (24) and\nYabuki et al. (List 4) (25) have estimated errors of 7.5 and\n3.5 kb respectively. OriDB assigns origins identified by\nthese two studies as the same if they lie <11 kb apart, but\ndistinct if they lie >11 kb apart. (For further details of origin\nlists and resolution values see Supplementary Note 2.)\nTo amalgamate the data, the cohort of cloned origins\n(list 1) was first added to the database. To prevent duplicate\nentries, origins sites in the lower resolution datasets were\nlabeled as \u2018already included\u2019 if the same site (assessed as\ndescribed above) was added to the database from list 1.\nNext, those origins from list 2 not present on list 1 were\nadded to the database. As before, lists 3\u20136 were then exam-\nined to ascertain whether they had identified each of the\nsites in list 2 and entries were labeled accordingly. Next,\nthose origins on list 3 that had not yet been included in\nthe database were added, again labeling lists 4\u20136 according\nto whether they had identified those sites. Outstanding\nassignments from the remaining lists, in order of study\nresolution, were then added in the same way. (For further\ndetails of this amalgamation process see Supplementary\nNote 3.)\nFigure 1. Cartoon of a Budding Yeast Replication Origin. Nucleosomes are\nexcluded from the replication origin sequence elements which include the\nessential ACS (hatched box), the B1 (stippled box) and additional B elements\n(open box) that contribute to origin activity. The ACS and B1 elements\nare involved in ORC recruitment. Remaining B elements include a region\nof helical instability (the DUE or DNA Unwinding Element) as well as\nsequences that promote the loading of additional replication factors and the\nexclusion of nucleosomes.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue D41\nEach proposed origin site is assigned a status by OriDB\n(Confirmed, Likely, or Dubious) that expresses our confi-\ndence that the site genuinely corresponds to an origin.\n\u2018Confirmed\u2019 origins are those have been cloned and tested\nby ARS assay and\/or have been detected by 2D gel analysis.\n\u2018Likely\u2019 origin sites have been identified by two (or more)\nmicroarray studies but have not yet been confirmed. \u2018Dubi-\nous\u2019 origin sites are those identified by only one microarray\nstudy. In many cases, Dubious origin sites will correspond\nto \u2018false positives\u2019 arising due to the technical limitations\nassociated with the experimental approach of the study con-\ncerned. The automated data-merge process has been devel-\noped to optimize the results produced, but will inevitably\nresult in occasional inconsistencies or unexpected annota-\ntions. Occasionally, we have manually changed an automated\nStatus assignment where there is evidence to suggest that it\nis incorrect; such alterations are marked with an asterisk\n(e.g. *Dubious ARS on Chromosome III at 85 kb) and explai-\nned in the User Notes tab for that Origin Site (see below).\nFor all sites, we present as much information as possible to\nallow the user to make their own informed assessment.\nData from additional studies will be added to the database\nas they become available. This process may result in the\ncriteria described above \u2018evolving\u2019. The status of predicted\norigins will certainly change as more origin sites are experi-\nmentally verified. At the time of writing OriDB contains\n613 replication origin sites (279 Confirmed; 192 Likely;\nand 142 Dubious).\nDATABASE ACCESS, INTERFACE\nAND CONTENT\nOriDB is freely available at http:\/\/www.oridb.org\/. A user-\nfriendly web-based interface invites visitors to explore the\nsite and to examine the \u2018Searchable Origin List\u2019 that forms\nthe heart of the database. The database can be searched\nusing a search facility or by using the text box present on\nevery web-page. Search results list the Name(s), Genomic\nlocation and assigned Status for each origin site that matches\nthe entered search criteria, and provides a link to further\ndetails. These links take the user to the Origin Record\npages. Each proposed or confirmed origin site appears as\nan Origin Record in OriDB, with each Record comprising\nseven dynamically generated pages presenting the collated\ninformation for that origin site. This information is displayed\non each Origin Record under the following tab headings: Ori-\ngin Summary Information; Origin Summary Graphics; Origin\nLocation Assignments; Origin Sequence Elements; Phyloge-\nnetic Sequence Conservation; User Notes; and References\nfor this Origin (see Figure 2). Brief descriptions of the\ninformation provided in each of these pages is given below;\nmore complete descriptions are available on the OriDB About\npage (http:\/\/www.oridb.org\/about.php#full).\nOrigin summary information\nThis tab presents a text summary of what is known about the\norigin site. The genome location (chromosome number and\ncoordinate interval) assigned by the highest-resolution study\nto identify the origin, and the intergenic or genic location\nof the origin site are given. OriDB uses a static chromosome\ncoordinate system that corresponds to that used by the\nUCSC genome browser (28) and the Oct 2003 release of\nthe Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (29). Links\nare provided to external databases (such as SGD and the\nUCSC Genome Browser) from which the DNA sequence\nof the origin site can be retrieved. Where appropriate some\nor all the following information may also be available: a\nsummary of the origin substructure, including information\nabout proposed and\/or confirmed sequence elements and the\nstability of the DNA duplex at the origin site (\u2018Duplex\nDestabilization\u2019\u2014see below); time of replication during S\nphase; and the activity of the origin site when cells are treated\nwith HU.\nOrigin summary graphics\nThis tab accesses a page allowing the display of three stan-\ndardized graphic representations of DNA replication data\nfor the origin site. The \u2018Default\u2019 and \u2018Zoomed Out\u2019 views\nof the origin locality show primary data from the four\nmicroarray-based studies (24\u201327), and graphically indicate\nthe Status of the Origin site (Confirmed, Likely, or Dubious)\nand the gene structure for the chromosome window. The\n\u2018Detailed\u2019 view shows the free energy required to separate\nthe DNA strands [superhelically induced duplex destabiliza-\ntion or SIDD data (23)] and the location of proposed or\nverified origin sequence elements. Replication origins are in\ngeneral closely associated with SIDD minima, which are\nrelated to DUE sequences and are similarly thought to permit\nDNA unwinding during replication origin activation (23).\nClicking on any of these three standard graphics opens a\nmore interactive graphic window that allows the user to\nspecify display characteristics of dynamically generated\nplots (see discussion of the Chromosome Viewer below).\nTable 1. Origin location datasets used by OriDB, ranked in order of estimated resolution of their origin assignments\nList Data source Origin location assignment Estimated errors\/bp\n1 Cloned and assayed origins (12,26) ARS-assayed fragment +\/\u0002 0\n2 2D gel-confirmed origins (24,27) Analyzed restriction fragment +\/\u00020\n3 proARS sites identified by ChIP study (26) proARS coordinate interval +\/\u0002500\n4 Origins proposed by Copy Number Timing Study (25) Peak location +\/\u00023500\n5 Origins proposed by ssDNA\/HU study (27) Peak location +\/\u00024000\n6 Origins proposed by Heavy:Light timing study (24) Peak location +\/\u00027500\nFor each source of data the primary source reference used, the nature of the origin location information and the estimated errors are shown. Errors were calculated\nas described in (12). (For discussion of our treatment of ARS elements cloned and assayed on large fragments, see Supplementary Note 1).\nD42 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue\nOrigin location assignments\nThis tab displays the locations assigned for the origin site by\nthe genome-wide studies and individual origin characteriza-\ntion studies, where available. The locations displayed on\nthis page are as reported by the original studies\u2014that is,\nthey have not been expanded to include the errors described\nabove for each study.\nOrigin sequence elements\nThe sequences of proposed or experimentally verified origin\nsequence elements are displayed on this tab. The essential\nACS is shown in comparison to previously described A\nelement consensi (12,30\u201332). Identified B elements are also\nshown.\nPhylogenetic sequence conservation\nOrigin sequence elements are often phylogenetically con-\nserved amongst the closely related sensu stricto Saccha-\nromyces species (12). This tab indicates whether phylo-\ngenetic sequence conservation has been reported for any of\nthe origin elements. \u2018Highly conserved\u2019 means that at least\n12 out of 15 bp in the ACS are identical. Where conserva-\ntion has been reported appropriate sequence alignments are\npresented (including sequences from S.cerevisiae, Saccha-\nromyces paradoxus, Saccharomyces mikatae, Saccharomyces\nkudriavzevii and Saccharomyces bayanus) (33,34). It should\nbe noted that the sequence alignments used have not been\nmanually adjusted for optimal origin conservation. Similarly,\nan origin could be incorrectly listed as \u2018not conserved\u2019 if gen-\nuine phylogenetic sequence conservation was not apparent\nfrom the alignments examined.\nUser notes\nThis tab presents any manually curated information about\nthe origin site. OriDB users are encouraged to add further\ninformation about the origin using the link on this tab.\nReferences for this origin\nThis tab lists references relevant to the origin site under\nvarious heading with links to external databases, such has\nPubMed (35). Only references that have been curated within\nOriDB are listed (71 at the time of writing). These references\ncan be viewed by selecting the Yeast Origin References\nbutton present at the top of every page. Please contact the\nauthors regarding corrections or additional references for\ninclusion.\n  \n  \n    \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n      \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n      \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \nFigure 2. Screen Shots from the OriDB Origin Record for ARS731. Each origin site entry in OriDB comprises seven dynamically generated pages with a\ncommon Header (top). Example pages shown are: the Origin Summary Information; two (of the three available) Origin Summary Graphic views; Origin Location\nAssignments; Origin Sequence Elements; Phylogenetic Sequence Conservation; User Notes; and References for this Origin. Each page contains links to related\npages within OriDB and to external sites. Where particular data is unavailable for an origin site this fact is explicitly stated.\nNucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue D43\nCHROMOSOME VIEWER\nTo complement the database of DNA replication origins,\nOriDB provides an interactive graphic interface for viewing\nchromosome data (Figure 3). Various entry points are avail-\nable to this Chromosome Viewer utility: clicking on any of\nthe graphic displays within an Origin Site Record opens\na new window showing a Chromosome Viewer plot centered\nat that origin site; from the OriDB \u2018Useful Links\u2019 page,\nclicking on a chromosome number opens a new window\nwith the Chromosome Viewer displaying available data for\nthat entire chromosome. Various clickable options, available\nat the bottom of the Chromosome Viewer page, allow the\nuser to specify display characteristics such as the chromo-\nsome and coordinate range to view and which datasets to\ndisplay. Moving the mouse over the graphic gives further\ninformation about features on the plot and indicates availa-\nble web links. These links include external web pages\n(e.g. SGD for further information on transcription units),\nOriDB pages (e.g. Origin Summary Pages) and the ability to\nnavigate along the chromosome. Clicking on the chromosome\nscale bar (x-axis) recentres the display on the selected coord-\ninate, whereas clicking within the graph window recenters\nand zooms in 2-fold on the selected coordinate. Buttons dis-\nplayed above the graphic (not shown in Figure 3) allow\nfurther navigation. In summary, the Chromosome Viewer pro-\nvides a powerful user interface to visualize a wide range of\ngenomic data. This utility will facilitate better appreciation\nof the available data and understanding of the interplay\nbetween DNA replication and other chromosomal features.\nDISCUSSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS\nWe present here a fully functional database that collates for\nthe first time the available DNA replication origin datasets\nFigure 3. Example Screen Shot from the Interactive Chromosome Viewer. The OriDB Chromosome Viewer facility allows interactive graphic display of DNA\nreplication data for any genomic location\u2014in this case the whole of chromosome VII is shown. A control panel (below the plot) allows users to select datasets to\ndisplay, the chromosome and coordinate range, and the size of the plot to be displayed. Users can also navigate using buttons above the plot (not shown).\nD44 Nucleic Acids Research, 2007, Vol. 35, Database issue\nfor budding yeast. This database will provide a valuable\nresource to those working in the field of DNA replication.\nBy providing a consolidated dataset and powerful search\nfacility, OriDB will also assist those working in related fields\nby making the existing datasets more accessible. Many areas\nof chromatin biology are impacted upon by DNA replication,\nand specifically by the location and nature of DNA replica-\ntion origins. For example, it has been proposed the recomb-\nination hotspots co-localize with sites of DNA replication\ninitiation (36), and the location of chromosome structural\nproteins (such as cohesion) may be influenced by the sites\nand activity of replication origins (37,38). Conversely,\nDNA replication and origin function are influenced by other\nchromosomal features, including transcription (39), chro-\nmatin structure (40) and chromosome context (41), and\nthese relationships can be viewed using OriDB.\nThe structure of OriDB has been designed to allow for\nthe incorporation of additional budding yeast datasets as\nthey become available. Furthermore, we propose to develop\nOriDB to include parallel databases for other organisms as\ncomparable DNA replication datasets are described.\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSupplementary Data are available at NAR Online.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nOriDB has been built on a large body of work only a fraction\nof which we have been able to mention here.
