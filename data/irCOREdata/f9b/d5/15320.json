Emitted terahertz photons would have a frequency equal\nto the splitting of the cavity polariton modes. The optical transition between upper and lower\npolariton branches is allowed due to mixing of the upper polariton state with one of the excited\nexciton states and is stimulated in the polariton laser regime. \u00a9 2010 American Institute of Physics.\n\u0004doi:10.1063\/1.3519978\u0005\nThe realization of efficient terahertz radiation sources\nand detectors is one of the important objectives of the mod-\nern applied physics.1,2 None of the existing terahertz emitters\nuniversally satisfies the application requirements. For ex-\nample, the emitters based on nonlinear-optical frequency\ndownconversion are bulky, expensive, and power consum-\ning. Various semiconductor3 and carbon-based4,5 devices uti-\nlized intraband optical transitions that are compact but have a\nlimited wavelength adjustment range and a low quantum ef-\nficiency. Among the factors that limit the efficiency of semi-\nconductor terahertz sources is the short lifetime of the elec-\ntronic states involved \u0002typically, fractions of a nanosecond\u0003\ncompared to the time for spontaneous emission of a terahertz\nphoton \u0002typically milliseconds\u0003. The methods of reducing\nthis mismatch include the use of the Purcell effect6\u20138 in tera-\nhertz cavities or the cascade effect in quantum cascade lasers\n\u0002QCL\u0003.9 Nevertheless, until now, the QCL in the spectral\nregion of about 1 THz remain costly and short-lived and still\nshow the quantum efficiency of less than 1%. Recent studies\nof strong coupling intersubband microcavities10 have shown\na possibility of stimulated scattering of intersubband\npolaritons.11 Here we explore the possibility of generating\nterahertz radiation in semiconductor microcavities in the re-\ngime of exciton-polariton lasing. The quantum efficiency of\nthis source is governed by population of the final polariton\nstate, which may be tuned over a large range by means of the\noptical pumping.\nIn the strong coupling regime in a microcavity,12 the\ndispersion of the exciton polaritons is described by two\nbands both having minima at zero in-plane wave vector k. At\nk=0, the energy splitting between the two branches approxi-\nmately equals \u0002\u0003R, where \u0002\u0003R is the optical Rabi frequency,\nthe measure of the light-matter coupling strength in a micro-\ncavity. Typically, \u0002\u0003R is of the order of several meV, which\nmakes this system attractive for terahertz applications.\nStimulated scattering of exciton polaritons into the lowest\nenergy state leads to so-called polariton lasing, recently ob-\nserved in GaAs, CdTe, and GaN based microcavities.13,14 If\nthe scattering from the upper to the lower polariton branch\nwas accompanied by the emission of terahertz photons, po-\nlariton lasers would emit terahertz radiation, and this emis-\nsion would be stimulated by the population of the lowest\nenergy polariton state. However, at first glance, this process\nis forbidden since an optical dipole operator cannot directly\ncouple the polariton states formed by the same exciton state.\nThis obstacle can be overcome if one of the polariton\nstates of interest is mixed with an exciton state of a different\nparity, say, the e1hh2 exciton state formed by an electron at\nthe lowest energy level in a quantum well \u0002QW\u0003 and a heavy\nhole at the second energy level in the QW. This state is\ntypically a few meV above the exciton ground state e1hh1.\nNevertheless, by an appropriate choice of the QW width and\nexciton-photon detuning in the microcavity, the state can be\nbrought into resonance with the lowest energy upper polar-\niton state. Being resonant, the two states can be easily hy-\nbridized by any weak perturbation, such as, e.g., a built-in or\napplied electric field. The optical transition between such a\nhybridized state and the lowest e1hh1 exciton-polariton state\nis allowed.\nWe consider the model optical system shown at Fig. 1. It\nconsists of a planar microcavity operating in the strong cou-\npling regime, and placed inside a terahertz cavity, which ad-\nditionally enhances the rate of the emission of the terahertz\nphotons and can be constructed using various approaches\nResonant\noptical\npump\nTHz\noutput\nQW\nFIG. 1. \u0002Color online\u0003 Schematic diagram of the polariton terahertz emitter\n\u0002not shown to scale\u0003.

We emphasize that if \u0004\u00040 both upper\npolariton eigenstates \tU\n\u2212\n\n and \tU+\n contain fractions of the\nbright exciton and photon and of the dark exciton. This al-\nlows for their direct optical excitation as well as for the ra-\ndiative transition between the states \tU\b\n and the lower po-\nlariton state \tL\n accompanied by emission of a terahertz\nphoton. The rate of the spontaneous emission of terahertz\nradiation can be estimated from the Planck formula\nW\b \u0007\n\t3\td\b\t2n\n3\n\u00050\u0002c3\nFP = W0FP, \u00025\u0003\nwhere the dipole matrix element of the optical transition with\nemission of a terahertz photon in-plane of the cavity is given\nby\nd\b = e\u000eU\b\tz\tL\n \u0007\n16b\beLz\n9\n2\u000b2\u00021 + b\b2 \u0003\n, \u00026\u0003\nwhere the last equality holds for a QW of width Lz with\ninfinite barriers. Equation \u00025\u0003 has a form of the product of is\nthe probability of terahertz emission in free space W0, and\nthe Purcell factor Fp, which describes the enhancement of\nthe rate of the spontaneous emission of terahertz photons due\nto the presence of the terahertz cavity. The principal effect of\nthe cavity is to increase the electric field operator by a factor\nof \u000bQ within the frequency band \u000b\t\u000f\t0 \/Q around the cav-\nity resonance frequency \t0, where Q is the quality factor of\nthe cavity.11 In the case of a narrow spectral width of the\nelectronic oscillator coupled to the cavity, this results in the\nPurcell formula10\nFP = \fQ , \u00027\u0003\nwhere \f is a geometric factor inversely proportional to the\ncavity volume V \u0004\f\u00071 for V V\u0007\u0002\r \/2\u00033, where \r is the\nradiation wavelength\u0005. In our case, the electronic resonance\nis broadened due to short lifetimes of the initial \u0002UP\u0003 and\nfinal \u0002LP\u0003 states. Applying Fermi\u2019s golden rule to a cavity\ntuned to be in resonance with a transition between homoge-\nneously broadened levels characterized by lifetimes \u000ei and \u000ei\nyields the following generalization of the Purcell formula:\nFP = \f\u0004Q\u22121 + \u0002\t0\u000ei\u0003\u22121 + \u0002\t0\u000e f\u0003\u22121\u0005\u22121. \u00028\u0003\nOne can easily find that, for lifetimes of the polaritonic states\nof the order of 10\u221211 s, FP cannot exceed 102, however high\nQ is. This estimate agrees with the experimental results of\nRef. 8.\nThe generation of terahertz emission by a microcavity in\nthe polariton lasing regime is conveniently described by a\nsystem of kinetic equations for the upper and lower polariton\nstates and the terahertz mode. We consider the following\nexperimental situation \u0002see Fig. 2\u0003: the hybridized upper\nstates are resonantly optically excited. Created in this way,\npolaritons relax to the lower polariton states, either directly\nemitting terahertz photons or via a cascade of k\u00040 states of\nthe lower polariton mode \u0002acoustic phonon assisted relax-\nation\u0003.

P is the rate of polariton\ngeneration in the upper mode due to the optical pump, and W\nis the rate of terahertz emission given by Eq. \u00025\u0003. In the\nstationary regime, the occupation number of the terahertz\nmode can be found from the solution of the above set of\nequations putting N\u02d9 U=N\u02d9 L=N\u02d9 R=N\u02d9 =0. Furthermore, if the\nterahertz channel of polariton scattering between upper and\nlower branches would be removed \u0002by setting W=0\u0003 our sys-\ntem of equations would describe the conventional microcav-\nity polariton system showing the usual features such as po-\nlariton lasing characterized by a certain threshold pumping\npower.17\nFigure 3 shows the dependence of the quantum effi-\nciency parameter \u0010=N \/ \u0002\u000eP\u0003 on the pumping rate P and tera-\nhertz cavity quality factor Q. The parameters used in this\ncalculation are as follows: \u000eU=\u000eL=20 ps, \u000eR=100, \u000eR\n=100 ps, \u000eUR=\u000eLR=10 ps, \u000e \/Q=10 ps, and W0=10\u22129 ps\u22121.\nOne can see that for this realistic choice of parameters cor-\nresponding to existing polariton lasers,13,14 the quantum effi-\nciency achieves \u0010=1.5%.\nFinally, we note that the mechanism of terahertz emis-\nsion considered here is qualitatively different from the re-\ncently discussed stimulated optical phonon assisted scatter-\ning between polariton branches in terahertz cavities.14 Here\nwe work with conventional optical microcavities in the po-\nlariton lasing regime. The terahertz emission is stimulated by\nthe population of the lowest energy exciton-polariton state,\nno optical phonon assisted relaxation is needed. Semicon-\nductor microcavities in the regime of polariton lasing may be\nused as efficient sources of the terahertz radiation having a\nquantum efficiency exceeding 1% according to our estima-\ntions.\nThis work was supported by EU projects CLERMONT4\nand POLALAS, and RFBR Grant No. 10-02-01184a.
