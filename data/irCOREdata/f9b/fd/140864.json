Many organizations have developed initiatives with the specific aim of\nsupporting women\u2019s career progression to the higher echelons of corporate life, such as\nmentoring programmes and women\u2019s networks. The retention of valued talent is\nrecognized as a priority and organizations strive to brand themselves as an employer of\nchoice. Such strategies have had some success and higher proportions of women are\nfound in more senior positions, arguably having broken through the glass ceiling.\nDespite this progress, women continue to leave organizations in higher proportions than\ntheir male counterparts at senior levels, and there is little in the literature examining this\nphenomenon. This paper attempts to fill this space.\nThe aim of this paper is to explore discursively how women partners represent and\ndescribe their decisions to leave a professional services firm. This context is important in\nthat the nature and structure of these services (usually project-based) place demands on\nsenior staff, particularly partners, in return for high levels of extrinsic and some intrinsic\nrewards. The demands include not only high levels of professionalism but also extreme\ncommitment, such as the ability to travel nationally and internationally on demand, to\nwork around the clock at whichever premises whenever necessary, and to provide speedy\nand efficient solutions to the clients\u2019 problems. Kumra and Vinnicombe (2008) provide\nan account of the nature of such firms. This study begins by considering the very limited\nliterature on women leaving organizations followed by an examination of the discourse of\nchoice within the work life balance literature. After outlining the methodology for our\nstudy of 31 women partners who have left a global management consultancy firm, we\npresent empirical evidence from the women themselves. We next discuss the\nimplications of such evidence and make suggestions for further research in this important\narea.\n5Women leavers\nDespite the level of concern expressed in many organizations, and Belkin\u2019s (2003) \u201copt-\nout revolution\u201d article which discussed the push of job dissatisfaction and the pull of\nmotherhood, a search revealed very little extant academic literature on senior women\nwho have left organizations. Of course, the decision to leave an organization does not\nnecessarily mean that women wish to permanently turn their backs on corporate life.\nMany women take career breaks at some stage in their careers, and Hewlett and Luce\n(2005) point out the ease with which women can \u201coff-ramp\u201d and the difficulties they face\nwhen planning to return to organizational life. The kaleidoscope career model (Mainiero\n& Sullivan, 2005) focuses on the \u201cfit\u201d of work and family, and offers an explanation for\nthe large numbers of middle management who leave corporate life. Women talked about\nopportunities and possibilities as well as the blocks experienced in creating their own\npath which provide challenge and allow specific needs to be met.\nMallon & Cohen (2001) studied women\u2019s transitions from careers within organizations\ninto self-employment, seeking a further understanding of how women themselves\nexperience and make sense of changing careers. Dissatisfaction with organizational life,\nchanges in organizations which contradicted personal values and principles, and an\nimbalance of personal and professional life were key factors in the decision to move to\nself-employment.\nLooking at more senior women leaving organizations, Marshall (1995, 2000) identified\nno single pattern, but emphasized the complex nature of such decisions, each of which is\nindividual and multi-faceted. Factors identified by Marshall regarding women\u2019s\ndecisions to leave employment included leaving changed roles that had become\nuntenable, blocked promotion prospects and wanting a more balanced life. One\nparticular theme was their experience of difficulties with inappropriate and often hostile\ninterpersonal behaviour, often for the first time in their careers. It was not that they could\nnot cope, but that they did not respect or want to work in such unproductive\nenvironments. Several such factors contributed to individual decisions in accumulating\nand complex ways. In particular, the choice relating to work-life integration emerged\nfrom these studies as a key explanatory factor.\n6Work life integration and choice\nWork life balance or work life integration?\nThe language used to describe the integration of work and nonwork domains reflects its\nsocially constructed evolution. Research emphasis has moved from \u201cconflict\u201d through\n\u201cseeking balance\u201d to \u201cintegration\u201d (Burke, 2004). Similarly there has been a shift away\nfrom \u201cwork-family\u201d or \u201cfamily friendly\u201d when referring to supportive organizational\npolicies to \u201cwork-life\u201d in order to remove the emphasis on parents, especially mothers.\n\u201cWork-life\u201d has also received criticism with its suggestion that work and life are\nsomehow separate (Eikhof, Warhurst and Haunschild, 2007), rather than work being a\npart of life.\nThe term \u201cwork\/personal life integration\u201d was offered by Rapoport, Bailyn, Fletcher and\nPruitt (2002) who seek to acknowledge the importance of individual priorities and\nchoices with the use of the word \u201cintegration\u201d, rather than \u201cbalance\u201d. They suggest that\nbalance indicates an equal split of time between the two domains, which is an unrealistic\nstate of affairs, whereas integration focuses on a sense of satisfaction in both the work\nand non-work domains. But \u201cintegration\u201d also suggests the blending together of work\nand personal life, and individuals do not always want to manage the two areas by\nmerging them and some may prefer to keep them separate. Thus, authors have begun to\nrefer to the harmonizing of work and the rest of life (Lewis & Cooper, 2005; Gambles,\nLewis & Rapoport, 2006) to indicate their interaction in positive ways. The demands\nfrom the work and non-work domains are not absolute and can not necessarily be easily\nmeasured. The demands vary, as do individual responses to such demands. It could be\nargued that people self-impose expectations with regard to performance of both work\nresponsibilities and household and other non-work obligations (Quick, Henley and Quick,\n2004). Managing such expectations can enable an individual to cope with conflicting\npriorities and Quick et al place more emphasis on the importance of energy in a given\nsituation, rather than the amount of time spent there. So the argument moves away from\na sense of balance or equality of the different domains, and acknowledges the relevance\nof timely emotional engagement within each domain and the ability to focus on\n7situational requirements. But this still suggests a large element of choice, whereas\nCaproni (2004) argues that the language used in the work life balance debate adds to the\npressures experienced by individuals who are seeking to achieve this elusive state of\nsatisfaction with both work and non-work domains. She describes the conceptualization\nof work-life balance as individualistic and achievement-oriented:\n\u201csetting us up to strive for one more thing that we cannot achieve and, in doing so,\nkeeping us too focused, busy and tired to explore the consequences of our thinking\nand actions\u201d (Caproni, 2004:212).\nThe family context\nThe continual working towards balance can also imply a greater choice over life\ndecisions than often exists. For instance, care may have to be provided for children or for\nelderly parents, but the demands for such care are often unpredictable, due to\ncombinations of circumstances, thus reducing the element of choice and control (Caproni,\n2004). Additionally, high-quality regular childcare for older children (6+), specifically\nafter school care, is more difficult to obtain than the more routine requirements sought for\npre-school children (Moore, Sikora, Grunberg &Greenberg, 2007).\nA study which compared single women without children with married women with and\nwithout children found that all three groups experienced similar levels of difficulty of\nbalancing work and non-work (Hamilton, Gordon & Whelan-Berry, 2006). This under-\nresearched group of never-married women without children experienced greater pressure\nto take on additional tasks late in the evening or at weekends, precisely because they were\nviewed as having fewer family obligations than others (Anderson, Stewart & Dimidjian,\n1994, cited in Hamilton et al, 2006). Similarly work was described as \u201call-\nencompassing\u201d, leaving few resources for seeking activities outside the work place\n(2006:408). This study provides a different, yet important perspective to the discussion\nof choice experienced by these individuals in the decisions they make regarding work life\nintegration.\n8Negative or positive?\nHowever, not everyone agrees that balance has been about seeking satisfaction in both\ndomains. A different interpretation suggests that one of the flawed assumptions in the\nwork life balance debate is that work has been portrayed as negative and problematic,\nwith individuals wanting to reduce the time spent at work as a result (Eikhof et al, 2007).\nThese authors suggest that work life balance programmes ignore the possibility that\npeople may gain satisfaction and fulfillment from work, and state that a common, and\ninaccurate, premise for flexible working arrangements is that \u201cwork-life balance\nprovisions are introduced to help employees reconcile what they want to do (care) with\nwhat they have to do (work)\u201d (Eikhof et al, 2007:327, brackets in the original). They\nargue that employees may want to work and that the work life balance debate tends to\nignore this as a possibility. However, others talk about positive spillover (Kirchmeyer\n1993) and the enrichment which takes place between work and family (Greenhaus &\nPowell, 2006).\nControl and workplace flexibility discourses\nLewis, Gambles and Rapoport (2007:361) argue that there are in fact two overlapping\nwork life balance discourses; \u201cthe personal control of time\u201d and \u201cworkplace flexibility\u201d\nwith both including a dimension of choice. The former indicates that individuals are able\nto make their own decisions about the priorities in their lives around work, career, family\nand other aspects of life, paying little attention to the gendered assumptions about\ncommitment and competence which underpin the concept of the ideal worker (Rapoport\net al, 2002). Flexibility discourses emphasise the choice available to employees\nregarding where, when and how much to work, and again may not challenge the gendered\nconstraints to adoption of FWAs. These two discourses are evident in a study by Drew\nand Murtagh (2005). Firstly senior managers felt unable to control their work time in\nterms of demonstrating what might be considered \u201cnormal hours\u201d, because of the long\nhours culture. Similarly, the flexibility discourse was highlighted with flexitime and\nhome working arrangements seen as incompatible with senior management posts,\nparticularly by the male managers.\n9Genuine choice or pressure of the \u2018ideal worker\u2019\nAdditionally, women may view working as a financial necessity rather than a real choice\n(Houston & Marks, 2005) partly because of the huge effort needed to overcome the\npsychological and practical barriers in order to work. This does not, of course, preclude\nthe experiencing of some satisfaction as a result of working.\nManagers and professionals are particularly susceptible to the \u201cideal worker\u201d norm of\ndomesticity and the subsequent doubt over their commitment to their employer and their\ncareer if they stray from that ideal by adopting a pattern of work which involves less face\ntime. The ideal worker has historically been seen as someone who can give their time\nunstintingly and willingly to their employing organization, and have no conflicting\ndemands on their time (Rodgers & Rodgers, 1989; Pitt-Catsouphes, Kossek and Sweet,\n2006). Alongside this is the assumption of the existence of another adult based full time\nin the home to attend to domestic and caring responsibilities. In the 21st century many\nfamilies do not have such a structure of full time breadwinner and full time homemaker\n(Marks, 2006) and households may consist of different mixes of number of adults, age\nand number of children or no children, and presence or absence of elderly dependents\n(Ransome, 2007).\nOther literature focuses on the issue of choice in women\u2019s careers. For instance,\nLyonette and Crompton (2008) talk about the choices women accountants make in their\ncareers, finding some indication of women choosing to stick at the level below partner\nbecause of the increased demands and pressures which would result from such a\npromotion, including the adverse impact on family life. They point out that choices are\nmade from a range of \u201crealistic\u201d possibilities, within the bounds of constraining factors,\nand for women, domestic responsibilities are examples of such constraints.\nHence the language in the work life balance arena shapes the way in which the\nconstraints are framed, choices made and outcomes achieved. The personal control of\ntime and the ability to work flexibly are two discourses that contain both constraints and\nchoices, but whilst personal control of time may be easier for some senior staff, the\nability to work flexibly may not always be available for those at the top of some types of\norganization, especially client-based services. For women at partner level in professional\n10\nservice firms at the peak of their careers, in the mature life stage, probably having already\nacquired significant financial resources, one choice may be to exit or \u2018off-ramp\u2019, rather\nthan continue their professional career within their firm. This study examines what\nhappened in the case of those women who made the choice to leave.\nDiscursive approach\nIn this study, the discursive approach is viewed as an examination of how language (in\nthe form of spoken interaction) is used to construct and change the social world, while\nchallenging the accepted ways of looking at the world (Dick, 2004). We use Watson\u2019s\n(1995:816) description of discourse as a \u201cconnected set of statements, concepts, terms\nand expressions, which constitutes a way of talking or writing about a particular issue,\nthus framing the way people understand and act with respect to that issue.\u201d So it is a\nform of sense-making, both on the part of the interviewees, who here make decisions\nabout the information to include and to omit in their accounts of their decision to leave\nthe firm (Potter & Wetherell, 1987), and also on the part of us, the interviewers and\nresearchers. We examine the varied discursive constructions used by the participants to\nachieve their particular purposes, whether this is their portrayal of themselves as valued\npartners or of making sense of what is happening within the firm, particularly with regard\nto the number of women partners leaving. As Watson points out, these discursive\nconstructions are similar to interpretative repertoires (Gilbert & Mulkay, 1984, cited in\nEdley, 2001:197) which are \u201cquite separate ways of talking about or constructing\u201d a\ngiven topic. Similarly, Clarke, Brown & Hope-Hailey, (2009) refer to \u201cantagonistic\ndiscourses\u201d where individuals present self-narratives which incorporate contrasting\npositions.\nMethod\nFollowing an approach from an international management consultancy firm, we sought\ninterviews with women partners who had left the firm over the previous three years.\nAccess was provided by the Head of Diversity who contacted the 47 women leavers in\nthat period to see if they would be willing to be interviewed. The project arose as a result\n11\nof the women partners leaving in higher percentages than male partners, causing concern\nwithin the firm, not least because of a range of initiatives which had been introduced over\nthe preceding years to support women\u2019s career progression. The 36 women who\nresponded were contacted by the project manager to set up semi-structured interviews,\nand 31 female partners eventually participated, a response rate of 66%. Only one\ninterview was undertaken face-to-face in the UK, as most of the women were resident\noverseas. We therefore continued using telephone interviews over a period of about a\nmonth, after piloting the method to ensure that an open and frank discussion would be\npossible. The interview schedule was emailed to the respondents the day before the\ninterview. Interviews lasted about 45 minutes and were recorded with the permission of\nthe interviewees. Anonymity was guaranteed, and raw data were not given to the firm,\nalthough a report was delivered including recommendations for good practice.\nThe first step in the analysis involved the reading and re-reading of the transcripts by all\nthree researchers and then a discussion to identify discursive patterns within the text. The\ndiscursive approach to analysis requires a familiarity with the data (Kelan, 2007) and this\ncontinued through the use of NVivo, organizing and categorizing the data, focusing on\nthe similarities and differences in the ways participants talked about choice and the\ndecisions made during their employment with the firm and their decisions to leave.\nFurther discussion occurred, leading to deeper understanding of the concepts invoked by\nthe texts. In reporting the findings some demographic detail will be supplied to provide\nsome context to the quotations used, but the aim of this paper is to understand how the\nwomen made sense of the choices they made, rather than to seek any connnection\nbetween choices made and factors such as gender, parental status etc.\nThe Sample\nThe women ranged in age from 37 to 60 and two thirds were married or with a partner.\nSixteen women had children under the age of 18 and the other fifteen either had no\nchildren or their children were grown up. Five women were currently at home full time\nwith children of varying ages and a further four were retired. Eleven women were in paid\nemployment undertaking a variety of roles with differing levels of responsibilities. Three\n12\nwomen had their own businesses, and nine were involved with voluntary work,\nsometimes alongside paid work. Length of employment with the firm ranged from 4 to\n29 years and the women had left up to four years previously. Twenty one of the women\nhad most recently worked in North America and the remaining ten had worked in the\ncontinents of Africa, Australia, Asia and Europe.\nThe financial situation was a major factor for most of the women. Eighteen out of the 31\nwomen had left three years previous to the interviews at a time of general economic\ndownturn and many of these talked about the financial package which was made\navailable to them. For some, this allowed them to maintain their desired lifestyle without\nhaving to earn money in the future.\nThe following section identifies two contradictory discursive constructions: that of\nloyalty for the firm as a wonderful place to work, and secondly a discourse of the lack of\nchoice and control over lifestyle with regard to meeting priorities from both the work and\nnon-work domains. It is important to note that these discourses were not separate but\nwere enmeshed within the interviews. We will discuss these discourses, highlighting\ndiffering elements of the discourse of choice and lifestyle as we contrast it with the\nloyalty discourse.\nContrasting discourses\nLoyalty\nThis discourse emerged through representations of the women\u2019s positive experiences\nduring their time with the firm and their statements of the high regard in which they held\nthe firm. The previous limited research has highlighted the negative factors which\ncombined to push women towards the decision to leave organizations. In this study, we\nidentify resistance to criticizing the firm through the loyalty discourse.\nSherri\u2019s talk illustrates the emphasis on the firm as a good place to work, despite\nreservations which may have occurred over time. She evidently felt that it was important\nto provide a context for her honesty about some of the more negative experiences which\ncontributed towards her decision to leave.\n13\nI would say that in the grand scheme of things [ABC] is probably the best place to\nwork. I really don\u2019t want comments taken out of context because I still stayed with\n[ABC] for 20 years. I really did check this a number of times in my career when I\nwas low and thinking of leaving, and I looked at the options and the other\norganizations I could work with etc and I still believe that [ABC] is a great place to\nwork. (Sherri, no children)\nSherri refers to the ongoing choice she has made over a number of years to remain with\nthe firm. The loyalty discourse included a strong need for the interviewees to present\ntheir affection for the firm indicating a sense of respect for the firm itself as an\norganization and also for the people who work there. Suzan\u2019s view represents this high\nregard for previous colleagues:\nI have a high regard for the company and the people and everything it stands for.\n(Suzan, children 12-18 years)\nPart of the loyalty was evidenced through a strong sense of identity with the firm, and\ngratitude for the opportunities which had been made available and fully utilised.\nThe firm was a very big part of me for a very long time. (Joya, no children)\nI love [ABC], I really love [ABC] and I had a great career and I\u2019m very thankful and\ngrateful for what I learned and the people with whom I worked and what I achieved, it\nwas a great, great career. I loved it. (Megan, children 5-12 years)\nDespite the eventual decision to leave, these women were keen to stress their successful\ncareers in a highly regarded firm. Joya\u2019s comment in particular offers some explanation\nfor the emphasis on loyalty. Her social identity was enmeshed with the reputation of the\nfirm, and to acknowledge and allow criticism of the firm would therefore involve self\ncriticism which these successful women would not be comfortable with.\nChoice and lifestyle\nIssues around choice and lifestyle emerged in three ways: choice in the desire for greater\nintegration of work and non-work, choice within a context of constraints, and choice and\n14\nthe demanding role of partner. Our intention is to demonstrate the contradictory nature of\nthe loyalty discourse with the significant sets of choice discourses on which the\nparticipants drew to explain their decision to leave the firm.\nChoice in desire for greater integration\nThe choice discourse manifests through the representations of individual priorities when\nthe women described the position of work within their whole lives. There was no sense\nof seeking an equal division of time within the work and the non-work domains, and\nsimilarly the women did not talk of blending or integrating their work and personal lives.\nAileen expressed her loyalty and affection for the firm: \u201cABC is a wonderful company\nand I think very highly of it\u201d but she also explained how she had recently gone through a\ndivorce and wanted to reduce her time away from home and her children at such a\ndistressing time for them. However, she perceived herself to have no option other than to\ncontinue to work in the same way:\nI felt [the senior partners] were, although nice, they were very unsympathetic to the\nsituation and I just don\u2019t feel that there were any options there. \u2026 It was kind of like\nyou understand what the expectations are, you\u2019ve always been a good performer, you\nknow what it takes and either accept it or don\u2019t. ... There was no discussion about part\ntime, it was just accept it; you\u2019re going to have to travel if you want to be there. There\nwas just no sympathy at all. (Aileen, children 12-18 years)\nSo the discourse of choice becomes polarized and these women demonstrated their\nawareness of the extreme options they had to consider. Kim expressed her appreciation\nof the initiatives within the firm which had been introduced to support women\u2019s career\nprogression:\nI know everything the firm\u2019s done and we\u2019ve done so much to help retain senior\nwomen. \u2026 We\u2019ve done so many great things, so I want to give credit to all of that but\nevery once in a while I just came to the realisation that you want to have this great\ncareer that requires a tremendous amount of time and commitment and you just can\u2019t\nbalance everything sometimes. (Kim, children under 12 years)\n15\nThere was an increasing recognition by some of the women of the demands which family\nlife placed on them and Kim went on to explain the shift in her desires away from doing\nwhatever was required by the firm:\nThe year prior to when I had my third child, I tried a part time schedule and that\nhelped but I think once I was home with all three kids, getting involved with their\nlives more, over the year and a half that I was home on this leave of absence, it just\nbecame clearer and clearer to me that I wanted to be at home with them. The balance\nI had been trying to achieve was so difficult; I had to make a choice, so that\u2019s why I\nfinally chose to resign this past January. (Kim, children under 12 years)\nThere appeared to be a gradual acknowledgement that any sort of balance between the\nwork and nonwork domains was not possible. Alexis suggested that the only practical\nway to achieve such a balance was sequentially, prioritizing work or family at different\ntimes.\nI came to the realization at one point because I was in that group of women who felt\nyou could have it all and I ultimately came to the realization yes you can have it all\nbut not all at once, you just have to take different stages of your life and I just had to\ncome off the consulting career path for five years at important stages of my parenting.\n(Alexis, grown up children)\nYet, she too presented an interesting contradictory perspective in her statement: \u201cI think\nvery highly of ABC and I found ABC to be very, very supportive of my time and\nparticipation in the firm\u201d. So she had to step off the career path to attend to parenting\npriorities, and yet still spoke of the support she received, so again illustrating the\ncontradictory elements of this discourse.\nThe difficulty in achieving any sort of compromise between the demands of work and\nhome was echoed by Libby who used particularly emotive language as she described the\noptions which she had clearly rejected, but which would have enabled her to maintain her\nprevious high levels of performance.\nI wanted to come back to work, I loved my job, but I found no matter how much I\ntried I just couldn\u2019t be the same top performer that I was before I had my baby. Sure,\n16\nI could have made the decision to outsource my family and get a full time live-in\nnanny and continue to work the same hours, but I didn\u2019t want to do that. I didn\u2019t want\nto sell my family off to somebody else. (Libby, children under 5 years)\nLibby provides an interesting contrast to many of the other women who engage in both\nthe discourses of loyalty, and of choice. Although she expresses enthusiasm, it is for her\njob rather than for the firm. Instead of the loyalty and affection, there was a sense of\nresentment and anger at the lack of support and understanding which effectively removed\nthe option of staying with the firm. It would have been at too great a cost.\nSimilarly, Cassie explained the discrepancy between the wants and needs of junior\ncolleagues and the lifestyle which they observed of the existing partners.\nI\u2019ve seen too many associate partners leave because they\u2019ve said to me I don\u2019t want\nthat lifestyle, I need to have some time to have children and deal with elder care and\nwhatever, so I think the firm really needs to address that because they are losing a lot\nof talent. (Cassie, children under 5 years)\nSo there are some fundamental life choices within this discourse of choice, requiring\nwomen to consider their future and the investment of time needed to achieve their\nlifestyle goals.\nDo I want to take this job or do I want to go and do the things I want to do, i.e. get\nmarried, have a family and all that? Now I\u2019m not saying you can only have one or the\nother, but I was thinking that being involved in work at [ABC], I have forgotten about\na lot of things in life, you know what I\u2019m saying? (Aisah, children under 5 years)\nChoice in a context of constraints\nThe choice discourse is presented paradoxically, with a spectrum which has \u201call work\u201d at\none end and \u201call family\u201d at the other. Despite the use of various strategies over time, the\nwomen were experiencing a feeling of being pushed into decisions they find problematic.\nHowever, there is also uncertainty in the way forward. Laura questioned the boundaries\nshe would be looking to put in place if she were to return to a role similar to her previous\none with the firm.\n17\nI have thought if a big project came up and [ABC] asked for me to come back, what\nwould be the parameters that would be ideal with respect to that balance because it\ncertainly does change at every point in time, every life change. (Laura, children 12-18\nyears)\nFreeing themselves up to spend more time with their children was a key part of the\ndiscourse for the mothers in the sample. Women with children of differing ages had\nconcluded that it was the right time to work and travel less, in order to spend more time\nwith family. For instance, Kerry, who had \u201cbeen with [ABC] for 20 years and had a\nwonderful career with [ABC] and had fantastic opportunities\u201d went on to say:\nI feel a little bit like I\u2019ve missed out on the first ten to twelve years of their lives and I\nwanted to be more involved in their teenage years than I was in their toddler years and\nbe available to them. \u2026 Unfortunately in my professional role in [ABC] it was not\npossible to have that time and flexibility to get involved in their lives to the extent that\nI wanted to. (Kerry, children under 12 years)\nSimilarly, Ellen explained\nI love [ABC]. [ABC] gave me the life I have right now. \u2026 But being around for my\ntwo children is my big role right now. \u2026 I want to be there for this part of their life, I\ndon\u2019t want to miss my kids growing up. (Ellen, children under 12 years)\nSo Kerry and Ellen have availed themselves of the only option they could see within\nABC, that of leaving the firm that they regard so highly, as there is little support to enable\nthem to meet their other priorities.\nChoice and the demanding role of partner\nIn a different way, those without children talked of the importance of spouses\/partners,\nfamilies and friends in their lives, and of the challenge of managing the competing\ndemands on their time. The demanding nature of the partner role makes it difficult to\nallocate significant amounts of time to others without the constant distractions from the\noffice and\/or the client, as Sherri described:\n18\nMy parents are aging, they\u2019re not well, and I all of a sudden decided I absolutely had\nto spend more time with them and that\u2019s not just on weekends, it\u2019s going and spending\nlarge blocks of quality time with them when I can just focus on them and not be on the\nphone or on the computer and everything else back to the work site. (Sherri, no\nchildren)\nThe issue of travel featured strongly in the choice discourse, as it was described as an\ninherent part of the role of partner by these women and was a major constraining factor in\nthe choices they experienced. The partner role requires a great deal of travelling, taking\nall of them away from their families and friends on a continual and relentless basis. In\nthe quotation below Agnes emphasizes her developing competence at creating non-work\ntime at weekends, but the inability to address the demands placed on her by the need to\ntravel.\nI still have an awful lot of respect for [ABC], but the travelling - everything else I\ncould manage because the work hours I could manage. I tended to work quite a bit\nbut I controlled it myself and I got better about not working weekends and so\neverything else I can manage but the travelling. (Agnes, children under 5 years)\nHowever, Kim explained that it is not just the travel, but the whole nature of the job and\nthe expectations of senior partners and clients, even when working locally to one\u2019s home\nbase described as \u201can in town job\u201d. Such a working arrangement added the additional\npressure of expectations from immediate family of a greater presence in the home,\nbecause of the assumption of more normal working hours.\nThe client comes first and that means whatever you need, whatever hours are required,\nit can be just as hard to be on an in town job, so even when there is no travel, but\nyou\u2019ve got to be at the client at 7am for a meeting or there\u2019s a crisis and you\u2019re there\nuntil 11. Sometimes I found being in town can be just as demanding because your\nfamily thinks you\u2019re at home, so why aren\u2019t you coming home for dinner, and eating\nwith them? You\u2019re still spending all your time away. (Kim, children under 12 years)\n19\nDiscussion\nAbout half of these women had children under the age of 18, yet the issues of\nmotherhood were not about coordinating childcare arrangements or dividing up parenting\nwith a partner, but about wanting to spend time with children at varying stages in their\nlives. Several of those without children, or with grown up children, talked of wanting\nthe opportunity to have broader experiences in their lives, mentioning wider family and\nfriends. Unfortunately many tended to see the issue as very clearly defined in terms of\neither their role within the firm or a life outside the firm.\nThe women in this sample were not necessarily off-ramping but seeking to work in a way\nwhich gave them control over their lives, especially with respect to minimizing the\namount of travel which took them away from home on a regular basis. Although there\nwas evidence of the pull of motherhood mentioned by Belkin (2003), these women did\nnot express dissatisfaction with organizational life per se. On the contrary, they stressed\npositive elements of much of their careers, expressing loyalty and commitment to the\nfirm which many still held in high regard.\nAs is common with discourses (Watson, 1995), two dominant themes co-existed in the\naccounts of these successful women leavers, i.e. loyalty and choice regarding work life\nintegration. Yet the hegemonic positioning of the choice discourse meant that other\nalternatives were suppressed. Women showed loyalty and affection towards their firm,\nbut this was not reciprocated in the form of some temporary control over their personal\nlives or some flexibility so that they could manage less stressfully their nonwork\nresponsibilities. The flexible working offerings for women lower down the hierarchy\nwere much celebrated by the firm, but there was no flexibility in the partner tier. These\nwomen perceived that the firm was expecting all or nothing, and did not seem to\nrecognize the paradoxical nature of their loyalty to the firm and their decision to leave.\nAlthough there were combinations of factors which contributed to the women\u2019s decisions\nto leave the firm, the focus of this paper has been the discourse of choice with particular\nemphasis on lifestyle. There was little evidence of either balance in the sense of division\nof time between the work and nonwork domains, or of integration or the blending of\nwork and personal life. The discourse presented was of a forced and extreme choice.\n20\nHowever, it is clear that the women partners had certainly gained satisfaction and\nfulfillment from their jobs over a long period of time. The issue was not about \u201cwanting\nto care\u201d and \u201chaving to work\u201d, therefore demonstrating support for the inaccuracy of such\na claim, pointed out by Eikhof et al (2007). The financial package available at the point\nof departure and high levels of remuneration, often over a period of many years, enabled\nthem to leave, given that they felt unable to continue to work within the firm because of\nthe extreme demands that the partner role required.\nThe \u201cpersonal control of time\u201d and \u201cworkplace flexibility\u201d (Lewis et al, 2007) were both\nabsent, highlighting \u201cwork life imbalance\u201d. These women clearly did not fit the \u201cideal\nworker\u201d norm. Many were single or in a relationship with another full time worker,\nhence the lack of the \u201cother\u201d adult based in the home and needed by the ideal worker to\nbe able to maintain their level of dedication to the job role. Also these women had an\nincreasing desire to attend to demands from outside the work domain.\nImplications and conclusions\nThis study adds to what is known about the importance of family life for women, with\nmany of those who were not mothers still experiencing a tension between the demands of\nday to day organizational life at partnership level and the need to give attention to\nextended family and friends. Importantly, this study uses data from women who have left\nthe same organization within a relatively brief period of time, providing unique data and\nvaluable insights into what is known about women in senior positions who choose to\nleave and yet display tremendous loyalty and affection to the firm. These findings\ntherefore strengthen the choice discourse, which serves to neutralize and suppress\nfeelings of discontent over the constraints imposed by the firm\u2019s cultural expectations of\nthose in the role of partner. This effectively removes the responsibility from the\norganization of the need to facilitate the work life integration of partners.\nThe study has several limitations. First, we only talked to women partners who had left\nthe firm and left at a particular time of economic downturn when a significant financial\npackage was available to them. Speaking to women partners who had maintained their\npartner role in the firm during the same time period would have produced a useful\n21\ncomparison. Similarly the inclusion of men in the sample would allow useful gender\ncomparisons and this provides an opportunity for future research.\nUnderstanding the factors which led these valued women partners to leave the\norganization, notwithstanding the initiatives and support which had facilitated their\nachievement of such positions, will allow the organization to review the demands placed\non partners. The extreme expectations, particularly involving excessive travel and time\naway from the family, should be reviewed in the light of these findings, if the firm wishes\nto stem the flow of women partners.\nReferences\nBelkin, L.
