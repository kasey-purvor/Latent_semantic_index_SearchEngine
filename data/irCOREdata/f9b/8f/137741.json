Introduction \nOne of the most important concerns for the ferroelectric random access memory \n(FERAM) is fatigue [1]. Technologically viable solutions for this problem are now at \nhand. For example, the use of metal oxide electrodes, replacing Pt, can reduce fatigue [2]. \nHowever, they are electrically leaky and make the process more complicated and \nexpensive [3]. One feasible approach for reducing fatigue-related problems is donor \ndoping (e.g. La3+) without replacing the commonly used Pt electrodes with metal oxide \nelectrodes. According to the defect dipole model, which is well known for titanate \nceramics [4-5], the introduction of aliovalent dopant ions distorts the electroneutrality \ncondition. Therefore, higher-valence foreign cations (donors), such as La3+ for A site \nmodification or Nb5+ for B site modification, are compensated by negatively charged \ndefects, such as Pb vacancies. Lower-valence foreign cations (acceptors), such as Li+ for \nA site modification or Fe3+, Mn3+, Ni2+ for B site modification, are compensated by \npositively charged defects, such as oxygen vacancies, to maintain the overall \nelectroneutrality. Hence, acceptor doping normally leads to an increase in the oxygen \nvacancy concentration. According to the defect chemistry model, oxygen vacancies are \nthe only ionic species that are mobile in the lattice at ambient temperatures and the defect \ndipoles are the oxygen-vacancy-acceptor-ions associates. Hence, an enhancement of any \ninternal bias under an applied field can be expected only in the case of acceptor doping, \ndue to the increase in concentration of alignable defect dipoles. Donor doping, on the \nother hand, mainly introduces immobile defect dipoles which should result in a decrease \nof the mobile defect dipole concentration and hence in a reduction of imprint and fatigue \n[6].  \n 3\nThe main purpose of the present study is to develop improved PZT-based thin \nfilm materials with Pt electrodes. For this purpose, we prepared a series of Mn-doped \nPZT films and examined their ferroelectric and dielectric properties.  \n \n2. Experimental procedure \nAll the PZT and PMZT thin films used in this study were prepared on \nPt(100nm)\/Ti(5nm)\/SiO2(450nm)\/Si substrates using a sol gel\u2013based process described \npreviously [7-8]. The Pt was highly (111) orientated. The films were annealed at 560\u00baC, \nwere well crystallized and showed a single-phase perovskite with [111] preferential \norientation by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The Mn doping did not increase the \ncrystallization temperature required to obtain this type of structure. Films were \nelectrically assessed using standard polarisation field hysteresis and dielectric \nmeasurement methods [7-8]. The polarization fatigue tests were performed using a square \nwave electric field of 330 kV\/cm at 60kHz. The test pulse sequence used for retention \nmeasurement was as follows: at first, a triangular pulse of \u201310V was applied to write a \nknown logic state; then, after a predetermined time, the logic state was sequentially read \nby applying two triangular pulses of -10V (read#1) and +10V (read#2). The pulse width \nfor all triangular pulses is 0.5ms. The time delay between the write pulse and the first \nread pulse is called the retention time. \n \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \nFerroelectric fatigue is the loss of switchable polarization with repeated \npolarization reversal. Fig. 1 shows the normalized polarization of a series of PZT thin \n 4\nfilms with or without Mn doping as a function of polarization switching cycles, where P* \nand P^ represent respectively the switching polarization between two opposite polarity \npulses and non-switching polarization between two identical polarization pulses. The \nvalues of P* - P^ denote the switchable polarization. For the Pt\/PZT\/Pt capacitor (fig. 1a), \nthe switchable polarisation decreases after 107 cycles, reducing by about 50% at 1010 \ncycles. This type of fatigue is well known for PZT [9]. For the Pt\/PMZT\/Pt capacitor, a \n10% decrease of switchable polarisation was observed at Mn (0.2mol%) doped film after \n5 x 109 cycles as shown in Fig. 1b; a 2-3% decrease of switchable polarisation was \nobserved at Mn (0.5-1mol%) doped films after 1010 cycles as shown in Fig.1 c-d.  With \nfurther increases in the Mn doing level, the film started to exhibit fatigue, as shown in \nFig. 1e-f. A 50% decrease of switchable polarisation was observed at Mn (2-4mol%) \ndoped films as in the case of the capacitor of PZT.  The P-E loops of the PMZT (1mol%) \nthin film before and after the fatigue test are shown in fig. 2. There is no obvious \nreduction of switchable polarization at 1010 cycles. This indicates that small amounts of \nMn doping can greatly improve the fatigue behaviour of ferroelectric PZT thin films. It is \nworth noting that after 1010 cycles, the P-E loop moved to positive field and towards the \nself-polarization direction.  \nThere is considerable debate regarding the mechanisms that cause fatigue in PZT \nthin films with Pt electrodes [10]. Because the fatigue behavior in PZT is different for \nsamples prepared by various techniques and on various substrates, it is difficult to give a \nuniversally accepted model to explain the fatigue behavior of ferroelectric thin films [11]. \nThe two basic models are summed up here. First, internal fields due to space charge \nsegregation at both electrode interfaces can reduce the electric field in the ferroelectric. \n 5\nTherefore, if the space charge segregation builds up during cycling, then polarization will \ndecrease and fatigue will result. During repeated switching, oxygen vacancies may be \ntransported toward the electrode interface to set up a space charge layer that has the same \ncharacteristic as a Schottky barrier. Assuming there is a thin interfacial layer between Pt \nand ferroelectric film in the PZT and PMZT thin films under investigation, the equivalent \ncircuit consists of two capacitors in series. A simple model can be constructed with this \nthin interfacial layer of thickness \u03b4\uf020 and dielectric constant \u03b5b, and with the rest of the \nfilm, dielectric constant \u03b5f. If the measured dielectric constant is \u03b5 and the total film \nthickness is d then we can write: \nd\/\u03b5=d\/\u03b5f +\u03b4(\u03b5f - \u03b5b)\/\u03b5b\u03b5f        (1) \nHence, we can use \u03b5\uf020 vs d data to determine \u03b5f. Table 1 lists the values of dielectric \nconstant (\u03b5 ) of the PZT and PMZT (Mn 1mol%) thin films with different thickness. The \napparent \u03b5\uf020 of PZT was found to increase with the thickness of the film, while it remained \nconstant for the PMZT film. From an extrapolation of graphs of d\/\u03b5 vs d to d = 0 a \ndielectric constant \u03b5f can be determined. The obtained \u03b5f values of the unpoled and poled \nPZT and PMZT thin films are also shown in Table 1. It was found that the \nexperimentally-obtained values of dielectric constant \u03b5 \uf020of Pt\/PZT\/Pt capacitors at 33Hz \nare significantly lower than \u03b5f, indicating that the assumption of an interfacial layer is \nreasonable. However, the experimentally-obtained values of dielectric constant \u03b5 \uf020of \nPt\/PMZT\/Pt capacitors at 33Hz are similar to \u03b5f.  This indicates that in the Pt\/PMZT\/Pt \ncapacitors, this interfacial layer is too thin for the present experiments to detect. It has \nalso been noted that the apparent dielectric constant (\u03b5) of a 300nm PZT thin film \ndecreases after the fatigue test (1010 cycles) from 327 to 210, indicating a thickening of \n 6\nthe interfacial barrier, while the dielectric constant does not change for a similar PMZT \nthin film after the fatigue test. This indicates that after the cycles, no interfacial layer has \nformed in the PMZT thin films with Mn = 1mol%. \nThe second mechanism envisions the pinning of the domain walls by electronic \ncarriers or, more likely, by oxygen vacancies. If defects such as oxygen vacancies \nsegregate to the domain wall, they reduce the domain wall movement, resulting in \neventual pinning and degradation of switching ability. Unlike the first mechanism, this \npinning effect is a \u2018bulk\u2019 mechanism in the film and is not limited to the electrode \ninterface. The fact that we observe good evidence for an interfacial barrier layer in PZT \nand not in PMZT, which are very similar systems apart from the Mn-doping, strongly \nsuggests that the barrier mechanism is responsible for the fatigue in the PZT films, and its \nabsence explains the low fatigue in PMZT (Mn =1mol%).  \nThere are several possible reasons for the low fatigue behavior in small amount of \nMn doped PZT thin films: firstly, according to the quantitative model proposed by Arlt \nand co-workers for Ni-doped BaTiO3 ceramics, the acceptor ions and the compensating \noxygen vacancy are most likely allocated at the same lattice cell and act as a defect dipole \n[12-13]. These defect dipoles align in the direction of external field. The strong fatigue \nresistance in PMZT compared with PZT indicates that the defect dipoles formed in \nPMZT thin films are less mobile. It is quite well known in perovskite oxides such as \nbarium titanate that some dopants in the position of Ti4+ can bind oxygen vacancies \nthrough dipolar interaction [14]. It is possible that a similar mechanism operates here, \nleading to deeper potential wells for oxygen vacancies in the units containing \nsubstitutional Mn.  Hence, it is expected that the effective drift mobility of oxygen \n 7\nvacancies would reduce with the increase in the probability of encounter with Mn-\nmodified unit cells during its transport. The migration of oxygen vacancies to the \ninterface is probably the rate limiting process in the growth of the interfacial layer \nresponsible for fatigue. However, when further increasing the doping level above 1 \nmol%, the concentration of oxygen vacancies also increases, which helps speeding up the \nmigration of oxygen vacancies to the interface and leads to rapid fatigue, 106 cycles and \n104 cycles for the samples with 2mol% Mn and 4mol% Mn, respectively.  \nSecondly, it is believed that a flow of electric current, in particular, electrons, is \nnecessary for fatigue [15-16]. Under this theory, electrical fatigue in PZT thin films is \npredominantly due to electronic suppression of the polarization, and not from the \nmigration and subsequent trapping of charged ionic defects such as oxygen vacancies \n[17-19]. DC resistivity measurements of PZT and PMZT thin films show that the small \namount (\u2264 1 mol%) of Mn-doping in PZT thin films increases the resistivity (PZT: 4.3 \nx1010 \u2126m; PMZT 3.15 x 1011 \u2126m), probably through the reduction of the carrier density \nin the PZT films. This reduction may be contributing to a reduced fatigue in PMZT. It has \nbeen found that doping acceptor ions, such as Mn, in (Ba, Sr)TiO3 thin films also \nsignificantly reduces the leakage current [20]. \nIt seems plausible that electrons facilitate fatigue by enhancing the mobility of \noxygen vacancies. It would accelerate the development of either the space-charge layer \nnext to the electrode or the pinning effect on the domain wall. Du et al [10] have \nproposed that the formation of oxygen vacancies is probably facilitated by the conversion \nof Ti4+ to Ti3+ in the following reaction: \n2Ti4+ \u2192 2Ti3+ + V0\u02d9\u02d9         (2) \n 8\nThe role of electrons in facilitating fatigue is via de-ionization of V0\u02d9\u02d9:  \n V0\u02d9\u02d9 + e- \u2192 V0\u02d9        (3) \nThe lower valence of V0\u02d9 makes it easier to migrate by reducing the electrostatic \ndisturbance around it. Such an enhanced mobility of V0\u02d9 makes it a more potent defect for \nthe purposes of segregation. In the PMZT thin films, it has been proved by electron \nparamagnetic resonance (EPR) that there is a co-existence of Mn2+ and Mn4+ ions in the \nPMZT thin films [21]. We suggest that during repeated switching, the following reaction \nreduces the formation of oxygen vacancies induced by the conversion of Ti4+ to Ti3+ in \nthe thin films under investigation through the reaction: \n Mn2+ + V0\u02d9\u02d9 \u2192 Mn4+        (4) \nCombining reaction (2) and (4), we obtain a total reaction (5):  \n 2Ti4+ + Mn2+ \u2194 2Ti3+ + Mn4+      (5) \nReaction (4) actually helps to consume oxygen vacancies and may reduce the possibilities \nof their segregation at the electrode interfaces, or of the pinning of the domain walls \nduring the repeated electrical cycles. Although a 3% reduction of switchable polarization \nfor PMZT thin films after 1010 cycles has been observed, it was found that re-poling the \nPMZT thin films could rejuvenate this small amount of electrical fatigue. This indicates \nthat if this small amount of fatigue is due to domain boundary pinning, the domain \nboundaries are weakly pinned in PMZT.  \nThe retention tests for poled (V(-)) Pt\/PZT\/Pt and Pt\/PMZT\/Pt (Mn 1mol%) were \ncarried out with a negative write pulse (-330 kV\/cm) and negative pulse (-330k\/cmV) \nread 1#, positive pulse (+330kV\/cm) read 2# over a range of time period 1-30000s. The \nnonswitched polarizations and the switched polarisations of both capacitors showed good \n 9\nlinearity in the range of 1-30000s. The retention tests have also been performed using the \nwrite voltage of +330kV\/cm and a read voltage +330kV\/cm and \u2013330kV\/cm as a function \nof retention time and similar retention properties were obtained. No polarisation decay \nwas found within the time range of 1\u201330000s for both PZT and PMZT. The normalized \nretaining polarisations of both capacitors were estimated by comparing these values with \n2Pr. This was 50% for PZT and 95% for PMZT. This indicates that there was a \nsignificant polarization decay in Pt\/PZT\/Pt capacitor within 1s. This phenomenon was \nwidely observed [22-24] for PZT thin films. A significant improvement of the retained \npolarisation for Mn-doped PZT was obtained over a retention time of 30000s.  \n \n4. CONCLUSIONS \n This study has shown that an interfacial layer between Pt electrode and the PZT \nfilms has formed, leading to a rapid fatigue effect, but this layer was not found between \nPt and PMZT  ( Mn=1 mol%). We propose that the defect dipoles formed in such PMZT \nthin films are immobile. Hence, significant improvement in PZT fatigue and retention \ncharacteristics are obtained when small amounts of Mn atoms are doped into PZT thin \nfilms. Cycling the PZT thin films doped with Mn (0.5-1 mol%) up to 1010 switching \nbipolar pulses under 330 kV\/cm found only a 2-3% reduction of switchable polarization. \nThe other reasons that lead to low fatigue effect in such PMZT thin films, include that \nMn2+ ions consume the oxygen vacancies generated during repeated switching, forming \nMn4+ ions in PZT thin films. This further reduces the possibilities of oxygen vacancy \nsegregation at both electrodes or the pinning of domain walls. \n 10\nThe good hysterestic fatigue characteristics of the Mn-doped PZT thin films make \nthem promising candidates as device materials for memory applications.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe financial support of EPSRC under grant GR\/N06113 and GR\/R92448 is gratefully \nacknowledged. \n \nReferences \n[1] D.
