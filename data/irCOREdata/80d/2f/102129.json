Representing concept lattices constructed from large con-\ntexts often results in heavy, complex diagrams that can be impractical\nto handle and, eventually, to make sense of. In this respect, many con-\ncepts could allegedly be dropped from the lattice without impairing its\nrelevance towards a taxonomy description task at a certain level of de-\ntail. We propose a method where the notion of stability is introduced\nto select potentially more pertinent concepts. We present some theoreti-\ncal properties of stability and discuss several use cases where taxonomy\nbuilding is an issue.\n1 Introduction\nFormal Concept Analysis (FCA) is generally an appropriate framework for build-\ning categories defined as object sets sharing some attributes, irrespectively of a\nparticular domain of application. In this framework, categories are called \u201cformal\nconcepts\u201d each concept being a pair of an object set and an attribute set such\nthat every attribute holds for every object. This presents a convincing formal\nmodel of the philosophical notion of a \u201cconcept\u201d characterized extensionally by\nthe set of entities it covers and intensionally by the set of properties they have\nin common [1]. Formal concepts, in turn, can be gathered in a lattice structure,\nthus providing an overlapping taxonomy for the underlying categories.\nBesides, traditional lattice operations translate properly in taxonomical and\ncategorical terms: on the one hand, the meet of two categories is a sub-category\nholding objects belonging to both categories, along with their associated shared\nattributes; on the other hand, the join of two categories is the super-category\ndefined by attributes shared by both categories, and the associated objects.\nWhile formal concept lattices are theoretically robust, in practice, one often\nhas to face huge structures containing a prohibitive number of categories, even\nfor rather small datasets. Even if navigation in the structure is possible despite\nlarge sizes [2], readability generally remains a problem as, computational issues\nset apart, \u201ceven carefully constructed line diagrams lose their readability from\na certain size up\u201d [3] (p. 75).\nSolutions may consist in representing only the most meaningful portions\nof the lattice by assuming that some concepts are likely to be less relevant\nthan others from the standpoint of taxonomy description [4\u20136]. To this end, we\nneed to filter out nodes that do not satisfy specified constraints of a certain\nkind. In this paper, we develop one such pruning technique. In particular, the\nnotion of stability introduced in [7, 8] to discriminate irrelevant nodes seems to be\nparticularly appropriate and was fruitfully used in a previous attempt to prune\nconcept lattices in the practical case of epistemic community representation [5].\nHere, we apply the method to larger datasets and other domains\u2014other\nkinds of epistemic communities, but also other kinds of data\u2014as well as address\nthe dynamic description of the resulting reduced structures. While stability was\nsatisfactorily applied to a small sub-context consisting of agents using particular\nnotions, thus yielding meaningful taxonomies, it was unclear whether it could\nbe possible to go further in other domains and with much larger contexts.\n2 Formal framework\nBefore proceeding, we briefly recall the FCA terminology [3]. Given a (formal)\ncontext K = (G,M, I), where G is called a set of objects, M is called a set of\nattributes, and the binary relation I \u2286 G\u00d7M specifies which objects have which\nattributes, the derivation operators (\u00b7)I are defined for A \u2286 G and B \u2286 M as\nfollows:\nAI = {m \u2208M | \u2200g \u2208 A : gIm};\nBI = {g \u2208 G | \u2200m \u2208 B : gIm}.\nPut differently, AI is the set of attributes common to all objects of A and BI is\nthe set of objects sharing all attributes of B.\nIf this does not result in ambiguity, (\u00b7)\u2032 is used instead of (\u00b7)I . The double\napplication of (\u00b7)\u2032 is a closure operator, i.e., (\u00b7)\u2032\u2032 is extensive, idempotent, and\nmonotonous. Therefore, sets A\u2032\u2032 and B\u2032\u2032 are said to be closed.\nA (formal) concept of the context (G,M, I) is a pair (A,B), where A \u2286 G,\nB \u2286 M , A = B\u2032, and B = A\u2032. In this case, we also have A = A\u2032\u2032 and B = B\u2032\u2032.\nThe set A is called the extent and B is called the intent of the concept (A,B). In\ncategorical terms, (A,B) is equivalently defined by its objects A or its attributes\nB.\nA concept (A,B) is a subconcept of (C,D) if A \u2286 C (equivalently, D \u2286 B).\nIn this case, (C,D) is called a superconcept of (A,B). We write (A,B) \u2264 (C,D)\nand define the relations \u2265, <, and > as usual. If (A,B) < (C,D) and there is\nno (E,F ) such that (A,B) < (E,F ) < (C,D), then (A,B) is a lower neighbor\nof (C,D) and (C,D) is an upper neighbor of (A,B); notation: (A,B) \u227a (C,D)\nand (C,D) \u001f (A,B).\nThe set of all concepts ordered by \u2264 forms a lattice, which is denoted by\nB(K) and called the concept lattice of the context K. The relation \u227a defines\nedges in the covering graph of B(K).\n3 Stability\n3.1 Rationale\nAn obvious solution to reducing the number of groups of individuals defined as\nconcept extents by selecting \u201cmost interesting groups\u201d is to compute only an\nupper part of the concept lattice: concepts with extents comprising at least n%\nof all objects. This approach produces an order filter of a concept lattice often\ncalled nowadays an \u201ciceberg lattice\u201d. There are several well-known top-down\nlattice construction algorithms (see a review in [9]) and algorithms for computing\nfrequent itemsets [4, 10] suitable for building such iceberg lattices. The reduction\nin the number of concepts, as compared to the number of concepts in the whole\nlattice, can be considerable. However, one should be careful not to overlook\nsmall but interesting groups, for example, \u201cexotic\u201d or \u201cemergent\u201d groups not\nyet represented by a large number of objects, or, groups that contain objects\nwho are not members of any other group.\nUndoubtedly, the size of the concept lattice is not only a computational\nproblem. The lattice may contain nodes that are just too similar to each other\nbecause of noise in data or real minor differences yet irrelevant to a given purpose.\nIn this case, taking an upper part of the lattice does not solve the problem, since\nthis part may well contain such similar nodes.\nTo tackle the problem of selecting \u201cmeaningful\u201d concept intents, the notion\nof concept stability was proposed in [7, 8] and developed in [5]. The general idea\nof stability is as follows: A concept is stable if its intent does not depend much\non each particular object of the extent.\n3.2 Definition\nIn this section, we define the notion of stability of a formal concept introduced\nin [7] and [8] in a slightly different form than the one we use here. The definition\ngiven below is the one from [5].\nDefinition 1. Let K = (G,M, I) be a formal context and (A,B) be a formal\nconcept of K. The stability index, \u03c3, of (A,B) is defined as follows:\n\u03c3(A,B) =\n|{C \u2286 A | C \u2032 = B}|\n2|A|\n.\nIn [5], it is shown that the following proposition holds:\nProposition 1. Let K = (G,M, I) be a formal context and (A,B) be a formal\nconcept of K. For a set H \u2286 G, let IH = I \u2229 (H \u00d7M) and KH = (H,M, IH).\nThen,\n\u03c3(A,B) =\n|{KH | H \u2286 G and B = BIHIH}|\n2|G|\n.\nThus, the stability index of a concept is the probability of the intent B if\nall subcontexts of K over the attribute set M are equally probable. Stability\nindicates how much the concept intent depends on particular objects of the\nextent: a stable intent is less sensitive to noise in object descriptions. Besides,\nthe extent of a stable concept is not \u201cvery close\u201d to extents of its lower neighbors.\n3.3 Properties\nSince computing stability in general is a #P-complete problem [8], one needs\nsimple heuristics (easily computable sufficient conditions) to discard concepts\nwith low stability. The following two propositions give conditions of this sort.\nProposition 2. Given a concept (A,B) of a context (G,M, I), if there is a set\nA1 \u2282 A such that A\u20321 6= B, then \u03c3(A,B) \u2264 1\u2212 1\/2|A\\A1|.\nProof. Since A1 \u2282 A, A\u2032 = B, and A\u20321 6= B, we have B \u2282 A\u20321 and B \u2282 A\u20322 for\nall A2 \u2286 A1. Therefore, |{A2 \u2286 A | A\u20322 = B}| \u2264 2|A| \u2212 |{A2 | A2 \u2286 A1}| =\n2|A| \u2212 2|A1| = 2|A\\A1| and \u03c3(A,B) \u2264 2|A|\u22122|A1|\n2|A| = 1\u2212 1\/2|A\\A1|.\nIn particular, if |A1| = |A|\u22121, one has \u03c3(A,B) \u2264 1\/2 and the concept (A,B)\nhas fairly low stability: usually, one retains concepts with stability very close to\n1. Testing if A\u20321 6= B for some A1 with |A1| = |A| \u2212 1 takes O(|A|2 \u00b7 |M |) time.\nProposition 3. Given a concept (A,B) of a context (G,M, I), if there are\ntwo sets A1, A2 \u2282 A such that |A1| = |A2|, A1 6= A2, and A\u20321, A\u20322 6= B, then\n\u03c3(A,B) \u2264 1\u2212 3\n2|A\\A1|+1 .\nProof. By the condition, A1 \u2282 A, A2 \u2282 A, A\u2032 = B, and A\u20321 6= B, A\u20322 6= B. To\nobtain an upper bound of \u03c3(A,B) we need to consider the situation where the\nsize of the set P(A1) \u222a P(A2) (by P(X) we denote the powerset of X) is as\nsmall as possible. This is attained when A1 and A2 are as close as possible, i.e.,\n|A1 \\ A2| = |A2 \\ A1| = 1. In this case (since |A1| = |A2|) we have |P(A1) \u222a\nP(A2)| = 2|A1| + 1\/2 \u00b7 2|A1| = 2|A1| \u00b7 3\/2. Therefore, \u03c3(A,B) \u2264 2\n|A|\u22122|A1|\u00b73\/2\n2|A| =\n1\u2212 3\n2|A\\A1|+1 .\nIn the same way one may obtain a condition for three, four, and so on extent\nsubsets that do not give rise to intent B. However, it seems hard to get a useful\ngeneral statement for an arbitrary number of such extent subsets, which is related\nto the #P-completeness of computing stability.\nNow we describe how stability of concepts changes with the growth of the\ndata sample. Consider the situation when a context (G,M, I) is updated with a\nnew object g to form context (G\u222a {g},M, J) such that (G\u00d7M)\u2229 J = I. Then,\naccording to [11], we distinguish three possible types of concepts of the context\n(G \u222a {g},M, J): an old concept that is equal to a concept in the old context,\na modified concept of the form (A \u222a {g}, B) such that (A,B) is the concept of\n(G,M, I), and a new concept of the form ((A\u222a{g})\u2032\u2032, B\u2229{g}\u2032) such that (A,B)\nis a concept of (G,M, I) and B \u2229 {g}\u2032 is not an intent of (G,M, I). We denote\nstabilities in contexts (G,M, I) and (G \u222a {g},M, J) by \u03c3I and \u03c3J , respectively.\nProposition 4. Given a concept (A,B) of a context (G,M, I), if a new object\ng is added to the set of objects to form context (G \u222a {g},M, J) (such that (G\u00d7\nM)\u2229J = I), then for the stability of concepts of the new context (G\u222a{g},M, J)\nthere can be the following three possibilities:\n1. For an old concept (A,B), we have \u03c3J(A,B) = \u03c3I(A,B).\n2. For a modified concept (A \u222a {g}, B), we have\n\u03c3I(A,B) \u2264 \u03c3J(A \u222a {g}, B) \u2264 1\/2 + \u03c3I(A,B)\/2.\n3. For a new concept (A,B), we have\n\u03c3J(A,B)\n{\n= 1\/2, if B = {g}\u2032;\n< 1\/2, otherwise.\nProof. (1) The extents of an old concept and all its subconcepts do not change,\nneither does the stability.\n(2) First, we prove that \u03c3I(A,B) \u2264 \u03c3J(A \u222a {g}, B). In fact, by definition of\n\u03c3I(A,B) there are \u03c3I(A,B) \u00b7 2|A| subsets A1 \u2286 A (\u201cold\u201d subsets) such that\nA\u20321 = B and since g\n\u2032 \u2229A\u20321 = B for every A1 such that A\u20321 = B, we have also\n\u03c3I(A,B) \u00b7 2|A| subsets A2 such that g \u2208 A2 \u2286 A \u222a {g} and A\u20322 = B. Since\nA2 \u2229A1 = \u2205, we have\n\u03c3J(A \u222a {g}, B) \u2265 (2|A| \u00b7 \u03c3I(A,B) + 2|A| \u00b7 \u03c3I(A,B))\/2|A|+1 = \u03c3I(A,B).\nTo prove \u03c3J(A\u222a{g}, B) \u2264 1\/2+\u03c3I(A,B)\/2, we note that the largest stability\nof a modified concept (A\u222a{g}, B) is attained when A\u20322\u222a{g}\u2032 = B for each of\nthe 2|A| subsets A2 \u2286 A. Taking into account 2|A| \u00b7 \u03c3I(A,B) subsets A1 \u2286 A\nwith A\u20321 = B, we have\n\u03c3J(A \u222a {g}, B) \u2264 (2|A| \u00b7 \u03c3I(A,B) + 2|A|)\/2|A|+1 = \u03c3I(A,B)\/2 + 1\/2.\n(3) In the case of a new concept (A,B), we can have A\u20321 = B for A1 \u2286 A only if\ng \u2208 A1. The largest stability will be attained if A\u20321 = B for all such A1 \u2286 A\nwith g \u2208 A1. Formally,\n\u03c3J(A,B) =\n|{A1 \u2286 A | A\u20321 = B}|\n|2A| \u2264\n|{A1 \u2286 A | g \u2208 A1}|\n|2A| =\n|2|A|\u22121|\n2|A|\n=\n1\n2\n.\nIt is easy to see that the equality \u03c3J(A,B) = 1\/2 holds only for the object\nconcept of g, and only this concept has stability 1\/2. All other new concepts\nare less stable.\n4 Applying intensional stability\nAs such, stability measures how much a group of attributes depends on some of\nits individual members. This may thus be useful to detect unstable intents, and\ntherefore to build taxonomies where the aim is to represent intensional categories\nin a taxonomy principally based on attributes. In particular, this notion is likely\nto be relevant when investigating taxonomies of epistemic communities, i.e.,\ngroups of agents jointly interested in identical topics, sharing the same notions\n[12, 6]. In this respect, contexts where scientists are objects and the topics on\nwhich they work are attributes are particularly adequate: here, formal concepts\nrepresent epistemic communities as groups of topics representative of a field\nalong with corresponding agents. If a field is \u201creal\u201d, it should not depend on\na few scientists: removing a few of them should not change the topics of the\ncorresponding epistemic community \u2014 \u201creal\u201d epistemic communities ought to\nbe stable in spite of noisy data. Apart from noise-resistance, a stable field does\nnot collapse (e.g., merge with a different field, split into several independent\nsubfields) when a few members stop being active or switch to another topic.\nWe illustrate this criterion using two case studies featuring scientists attend-\ning a particular conference and biologists working on a particular model animal.\nIn both cases, while stability-based lattice reduction is significant \u2014 from thou-\nsands of concepts to less than 30 \u2014 we are still able to tell a meaningful \u201cstory\u201d\nwith respect to what field experts may describe.\n4.1 \u201cEuropean Complex Systems Conference\u201d\nFig. 1. The 25 most stable concepts in the ECCS dataset\nUsing the database of all papers submitted to the second European Confer-\nence on Complex Systems in 20065, we build a context made of authors and\nterms mentioned in article titles and abstracts. The resulting context contains\n401 authors and 109 terms, which yields a lattice of 6011 concepts. The reduced\nsubstructure featuring the 25 most stable concepts is presented in Fig. 1. Note\nthat the set of all stable concepts for an arbitrary threshold does not have to be\na lattice, even if it is in most of the examples used in this paper.\n5 http:\/\/complexsystems.lri.fr\/Portal\/tiki-index.php?page=ECCS\u201906\nFrom the examination of this lattice, it is possible to provide the following\ndesription of the community attending the ECCS:\n\u2013 The notion of \u201cnetwork\u201d is obviously a central issue: in addition to being a\nlarge community, it is also a parent for several associated subtopics: \u201csocial\nnetwork\u201d (agent-based networks), \u201cstructure network\u201d (topological issues),\n\u201cinteract network\u201d (networks as representation of interactions), \u201cnode net-\nwork\u201d (a node being a basic unit), \u201cdynamics network\u201d (evolution of net-\nworks) and \u201cmodel network\u201d (modeling of networks).\n\u2013 \u201cmodel\u201d is an important topic too and is related to \u201cagents\u201d and \u201csimula-\ntion\u201d, as well as \u201cdynamics\u201d (dynamical models in general), in addition to\n\u201cnetworks\u201d \u2014 it is also worth noting that there exists a sizeable commu-\nnity around \u201cnetwork dynamics model\u201d which refers to scientists interested\nin the modeling of network dynamics (morphogenesis). The use of models\nto reconstruct distributions of any kind, is represented by the \u201cmodel dis-\ntribut\u201d community. Finally, the modeling of dynamical processes (\u201cmodel\ndynam process\u201d), although sensibly less significant, is an interesting field as\nwell in this framework.\n\u2013 Some topics are more isolated as they do not form any joint epistemic com-\nmunity in the stabilized lattice \u2014 such as \u201calgorithm\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d (to\nthe left). These concepts are likely to refer to minor fields focused on par-\nticular issues: community and cluster detection, or introduction and use of\nnovel and general algorithms to achieve empirical measurements in a variety\nof cases.\nIn this lattice of 25 concepts it is not possible to see some fields which are\nactually representative of minor yet active subcommunities \u2014 such as \u201cnetwork\ndistrib\u201d, \u201calgorithm network\u201d and \u201calgorithm model\u201d, which are respectively the\n40th, 50th and 75th most stable concepts. Nonetheless, on the whole and given\na certain (high) level of epistemological description, the above story appears to\nbe fairly consistent with what experts of the field would perceive as the main\ntopics of complex systems science at this time.\n4.2 Embryologists working on the \u201czebrafish\u201d\nIn [5], we have applied stability-based pruning to data obtained from the biblio-\ngraphical database of MedLine abstracts coming from a well-bounded community\nof embryologists working on the zebrafish during the period 1998\u20132003, the goal\nof the application being to build a taxonomy of this research field.6 Since the\npurpose of that paper was to illustrate the proposed technique, we used a small\nrandom sample context consisting of 25 authors and 18 words. The incidence\nrelation of the context indicated which authors used which words in their papers\non the subject. The lattice of this context consisted of 69 concepts, of which\nwe selected the 17 most stable ones (with stability \u2265 0.52). They constitute a\n6 Data is obtained from a query on article abstracts containing the term \u201czebrafish\u201d\nat http:\/\/www.pubmed.com.\nlattice shown in Fig. 2 (some of the 18 attributes are not contained in any stable\nintent except for the intent of the bottom concept; they are not shown on the\ndiagram).\nFig. 2. The lattice of the 17 most stable concepts of a context built from 25 zebrafish\nresearchers and 18 words they used in their papers (taken from [5]).\nTaking a larger data sample, 250 authors using the same 18 words, we get\n1146 concepts. Of course, in the larger structure, stability indices are also larger\n(see Section 3), which makes it impractical to use the same stability thresholds\nfor pruning in both cases. Hence, we simply take the same number of the most\nstable concepts. Fig. 3 shows the lattice formed by the 17 most stable concepts of\nthis context (figures in boxes indicate the extent size of corresponding concepts).\nAs should be expected, the lattices in Figs. 2 and 3 are not identical, but\nstill share a lot of features in common. One interesting difference is that, in the\nstructure based on the larger data sample, \u201cpathway\u201d occurs as a subconcept\nof \u201csignal\u201d, which certainly makes sense from the domain point of view (\u201cpath-\nway\u201d on its own is still a concept intent, but it is not sufficiently stable in the\nlarger context). Some less important communities, like \u201cmouse, conservation\u201d or\n\u201csignal, pathway, mouse\u201d are missing from Fig. 3. Instead, the taxonomy result-\ning from a larger number of authors focuses on more solid associations ignoring\nsome particularities, which can be reintroduced by increasing the number of\nstable concepts included in the taxonomy.\n4.3 Improving the quality of taxonomies: linguistic processing\nIn our analysis of the ECCS and zebrafish data, we described authors in terms\nof words they used in their papers. We removed stop words (such as \u201cand\u201d or\n\u201cwas\u201d), common words with no special meaning for the domain (such as \u2018\u2019size\u201d or\n\u201cfunction\u201d), as well as \u201cparadigmatic\u201d words, i.e., those relevant to all members\nof the entire community even if they are not explicitly used by all members\nFig. 3. The lattice of the 17 most stable concepts of a context built from 250 zebrafish\nresearchers and 18 words they used in their papers.\n(the obvious examples are \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201csystem\u201d). The remaining words were\nstemmed using the Porter algorithm [13].\nIn the process, it has become clear that these techniques are certainly not\nsufficient: the resulting author\u2013word tables contain a lot of noise coming, in\nparticular, from homonymy and synonymy. We approached the latter by man-\nually combining synonyms\u2014or other semantically related words that could be\nconsidered equivalent for our purposes\u2014into one attribute. Of course, this re-\nquires some expert knowledge of the domain and cannot be done simply using a\ngeneral-purpose English thesaurus: words that are synonymous in everyday lan-\nguage can be used differently in the domain to be described or, on the contrary,\nthere may be domain-specific associations between otherwise unrelated words.\nHomonymy is even more difficult to deal with: words used on their own, without\ntaking the context into consideration, are not very informative; it seems more\nappropriate to use word phrases.\nThat we still get rather meaningful taxonomies from formal contexts obtained\nwith such poor means suggests that the methods we use further on may, in\ngeneral, be valid, but we believe that better linguistic preprocessing will have a\nsignificant effect on the quality of the resulting taxonomies.\n5 Applying extensional stability\nThe stability index discussed so far relates actually to intensional stability. In a\ndual manner, it is possible to define an extensional stability index, which indicates\nhow a concept extent depends on particular attributes: if a given extent were\nto lose some attributes, would it remain the same? In other words, would the\nobjects of a given concept still belong to a same category if they stop sharing\nsome attributes? A stable extent is thus likely to indicate a group of objects\nwhich do not depend on particular attributes.\nDefinition 2. The extensional stability index \u03c3e of a concept (A,B) is defined\nas follows:\n\u03c3e(A,B) =\n|{C \u2286 B | C \u2032 = A}|\n2|B|\n.\nLike intensional stability, the relevance of this index depends on the domain\nand the aim of the lattice-based taxonomy. For instance, affiliation data, in\nsocial science, defines people related to some organizations or events; in this\ncase, formal concept lattices represent taxonomies of agents who share identical\naffiliations. Extensional stability may be helpful in this situation in measuring\nhow durable links between people within a community are. In this respect, it\nprincipally relates to the social aspect of the group: if some people are together\nbecause they have a given activity, one may wonder whether they will still be\ntogether if they stop doing this activity. People who are also doing something else\ntogether are more likely to belong to stable extents. Here, extensional stability\ntests how much the community as a group of people depends on particular\nactivities. In other words, if one of the activities that unites them becomes less\nappropriate, will they still survive as a separate community?\nTo illustrate this, we focus on data stemming from a celebrated case study\nby Davis, Gardner and Gardner (DGG) [14] which features ladies attending\nparticular events in a small Mississippi town in the 1930s. Using a context where\nobjects are people and attributes are attendance to social events, it is possible\nto build a concept lattice representing groups of women attending jointly some\nsets of events [15]. However, even in this simple case the resulting lattice is\nalready rather sizeable with 65 concepts; finding cohesive subgroups in such a\nstructure could be uneasy. By contrast, the lattice corresponding to extensionally\nstable concepts (stability index strictly above .5) contains only three concepts,\nin addition to top and bottom nodes: their extents are {g14}, {g12, g13, g14}\nand {g1, g3}. The stabilized lattice is shown on Fig. 4.\nThe identification, in this data, of subcommunities together with core and\nperipheral members has already been the focus of several studies in social science.\nWhile interview-based identification in the original DGG study suggests that\n{g1, g2, g3, g4} and {g13, g14, g15} are respectively core members of two distinct\ngroups, a comprehensive review given in [16] reveals a collection of remarkably\ndiverse results, depending on whether subgroups were identified using, inter alia,\nprincipal component analysis, matrix algebra, information theory, as well as\nconcept lattices \u2014 by means, in this latter case, of a relatively manual approach\n[15].\nMost interestingly, a study by Doreian [17] agrees particularly well with our\nresults: it yields the same core members as those found in our stabilized lattice,\ni.e. {g1, g3} and {g12, g13, g14}. His approach relies on Q-analysis [18], whose\nprinciples are unsurprisingly analogous to FCA: for a given context, each object\nis defined as a \u201cpolyhedron\u201d where attributes are edges. In this framework, a\nformal concept can thus be seen as an intersection of polyhedra \u2014 extents and\nintents are respectively defined by polyhedra-objects and edges-attributes par-\nticipating in a given intersection [19]. Additionally, Q-analysis introduces the\nnotion of connected paths between polyhedra, which are plausibly useful for\ndealing with connection patterns between objects, yet irrespective of the actual\nattributes underlying these connected paths. As Freeman underlines, \u201cby con-\nsidering subsets of women who were connected at higher levels, Doreian was\nable to specify degrees of co-attendance ranging from the core to the periphery\naccording of each group\u201d [16]. The idea of strong relationships between objects\nindependently of particular attributes is not dissimilar to our notion of exten-\nsional stability, and could perhaps account for our identical results.\nFig. 4. The lattice of concepts with extensional stability above .5 for the DGG data.\nMore broadly, while extensional stability appears to yield a satisfying out-\ncome in this small case study, it is nonetheless the matter of further research to\ncheck its adequacy on larger datasets and different domains of application.\n6 Dynamic mappings\nLet K1 = (G,M, I) and K2 = (H,N, J) be two contexts describing the same\ndomain in two different time points (or periods). How has the domain changed\nbetween these time points? In particular, if (A,B) \u2208 B(K1) is a concept of K1,\nwhat has happened to it in K2?\nConsider a concept (C,D) \u2208 B(K2). If the closure of B \u2229D equals B in K1\nand D in K2, we may say that (A,B) and (C,D) are intensionally related. In\nthe case of the ECCS data, concepts intensionally related to (A,B) represent\nthe evolution of the field B between the two periods.\nFigure 5 shows two diagrams corresponding to the ECCS conferences in 2005\nand 2006. In both cases, we have selected the 15 most stable concepts. The dif-\nferences are as follows: the diagram for 2005 contains concepts with intents\n{network, dynamics}, {dynamics, model, process}, {dynamics, process}, and\n{information}\u2014all missing from the 2006 diagram, which contains its own unique\nintents: {interaction}, {network, social}, {model, agent}, and {simulation, model}.\nThe only 2006 concept intensionally related to {network, dynamics} is the one\nwith intent {network, dynamics, model}. This suggests that the 2005 topic de-\nscribed by {network, dynamics} has merged with the topic described by {network,\ndynamics, model}; at least, the difference between the two is no longer impor-\ntant at the given level of detail. The other three 2005-specific communities are\nintensionally related only to the bottom node of the 2006 diagram, which means\nthat they have disappeared or become less important. On the other hand, the\nbottom node of the 2005 diagram is intensionally related to the four 2006-specific\nconcepts, suggesting that they correspond to new subareas of research7. Even\nthough {model, agent} has a parent topic, {model}, already present in the 2005\ntaxonomy, the \u201cagent\u201d aspect is new, thus, defining a new subfield, that has no\ncorresponding nodes in 2005, which is indicated by the fact that it is intensionally\nrelated to the 2005 bottom node.\nFig. 5. Stabilized 15 concept lattice for ECCS 2005 and 2006\n7 Again, as we deal with \u201cstabilized\u201d lattices, these new areas are such only at the\nchosen level of detail. It would be more accurate to say that their importance has\nincreased.\nIn the above discussion, the social aspect of the communities has been com-\npletely ignored. In some contexts, it is more appropriate to describe the history\nof a community in terms of what happens to its members. In this case, if all\nauthors dealing with topic A in 2005 switch to topic B in 2006, B should be\nconsidered as the 2006 equivalent of the 2005 A-community, even if A is still an\nactive topic in 2006 (supported by newcomers, for example). Such population\nmoves can be captured by extensional relations between nodes defined dually to\nthe intentional relations.\nIt is worth noting that extensional and intentional relations defined in this\nsection originate from the mappings in nested line diagrams [3]. In the case of\nintentional relations, we assume that that G \u2229H = \u00d8 (if this is not so, we can\nalways time-tag the objects) and define a context K3 = (G\u222aH,M \u222aN, I \u222aJ). If\na nested line diagram of K3 is constructed so that G is used as the object set for\nthe outer diagram and H is used as the object set for the inner diagram, then\nthe nodes intensionally related to an outer node are the \u201crealized\u201d nodes of the\ninner diagram inside this outer node.\nAnother approach to dynamic mappings could be based on the theory of\nmulticontexts [20], which however has to be adapted for our reduced lattice-\nbased structures.\n7 Conclusion\nWe extend a previous approach based on the notion of stability to build arbi-\ntrarily small concept lattices from sizeable contexts. After presenting theoretical\nproperties for stability, introducing in particular several propositions useful for\nincremental computation of stability in evolving contexts, we distinguish inten-\nsional stability from extensional stability and illustrate them through selected\ncase studies, where one or the other could be suitable. In particular, intensional\nstability appears to be useful for epistemic community taxonomy building, while\nextensional stability seems to be more effective for finding cohesive subgroups in\ncommunities of agents attending various events. These example also demonstrate\nhow different expectations regarding what makes a formal concept relevant for\na given taxonomical description task may call for distinct usages of stability,\nextensional or intensional, which admittedly might not apply in all domains. We\neventually showed how we could make it easier to track significant taxonomical\nevolutions using dynamic mappings between stability-reduced lattices.\nAcknowledgements.
