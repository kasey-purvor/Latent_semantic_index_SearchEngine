Introduction \nRisks of high industrial inputs of cadmium and lead to terrestrial ecosystems are \nrelated to negative impacts on plants and soil organisms and the \n(bio)accumulation of these metals in the soil organic layer (Bringmark et al., \n1998; Palmborg et al., 1998). One approach to successful international \nnegotiations on the reduction of atmospheric deposition of pollutants is to \ndetermine the maximum level of constant atmospheric pollution that causes no or \ntolerable damage (\u201clong-term acceptable load\u201d or \u201ccritical load\u201d). Currently, this \ncritical load approach is being used for Cd, Pb and Hg across Europe (ICP \nModelling and Mapping, 2004; De Vries et al., 2005). \n 3 \nCrucial for critical load calculations is to define a metal concentration in soil or \nsoil solution below which no long-term damage to the ecosystem occurs. This \nconcentration is called the critical limit (De Vries et al., 2005).  \n \nThe most significant uptake route of many cationic metals by soil biota is via the \nsoil solution in the dissolved form, and especially as the free metal ion (Allen, \n1993; Sauv\u00e9 et al., 1994; McGrath et al., 1999; Vulkan et al., 2000; 2001; Di Toro \net al., 2001). The derivation of critical limits or environmental quality standards \nbased upon the free metal ion in soil solution, where possible, is therefore a \ndesirable goal of metal risk assessment. However most ecotoxicological data at \npresent are based on laboratory experiments where effects are expressed in terms \nof total added metal (data are summarized in Sch\u00fctze and Throl, 2000; Lofts et al., \n2004). In order to relate the free metal ion activity in soil solution to the metal \nconcentration in soil, linear regressions relations (transfer functions) have been \nproposed by several authors (e.g. Sauv\u00e9 et al., 1998b; 2000; Groenenberg et al., \n2003; Pampura, 2003a, b; Tipping et al., 2003; ICP Modelling and Mapping, \n2004; R\u00f6mkens et al., 2004). Sauv\u00e9 et al. (1998a) proposed a methodology for \ncalculating the effects of metals on soil processes, based on the free metal \nconcentration alone as the best predictor of toxicity, while Lofts et al. (2004) \nproposed the use of a critical free metal ion activity as a function of soil solution \npH, in order to consider the competing effect of cations. Both methodologies use \nexisting ecotoxicological data, where endpoints are expressed as a metal \nconcentration added to the soil. In both cases the added metal in the toxicity \n 4 \nstudies was considered reactive metal in the solid soil and was related to metal \nactivity in soil solution using transfer functions. \n \nHeavy metal soil solution activity-effect relationships are the basis for critical \nlimit derivation within the critical load approach ( ICP Modelling and Mapping, \n2004; Lofts et al., 2004; De Vries et al., 2005). Recently, two sets of TFs have \nbeen proposed to calculate free metal ion concentrations. The two transfer \nfunctions have the same general form but differ with respect to the data they were \nderived from: TF1 (Groenenberg et al., in prep.) is based on solid solution \npartitioning data obtained in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands (Tipping et \nal., 2003;  R\u00f6mkens et al., 2004),  TF2 (Lofts et al., 2004) is based on data from  \nCanada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Sauv\u00e9 et al., 1998b; Sauv\u00e9 et \nal., 2000; Weng et al., 2001; 2002; Tipping et al., 2003). All free metal ion \nactivities used to derive TF1 were calculated from the total dissolved metal \nconcentration using a speciation model WHAM\/ Model VI (Tipping, 1998). TF2 \nare based on both calculated and measured metal activities. Both sets contain data \nfrom a wide range of soils, necessary for the derivation of robust TFs. However, \nforest soils are rather underrepresented in both data sets, whereas they are \nimportant receptors in Europe. There is thus a need to test the applicability of the \nTFs to European forest soils in particular. Here we test the validity and \napplicability of transfer functions on independent data for different types of soil, \nincluding many forest soils from Germany and Russia.  \n 5 \n2. Materials and methods  \n2.1. Soil and soil solution sampling and analyses \nSoil samples were collected in Germany (Hessen) and Russia (Oka river basin and \nKola Peninsula) and analysed during the period 2000-2003. Detailed information \nabout soil type, location, land use, horizon, and sampling depth is presented in \nTable 8 of the Appendix. Kola Peninsula soils were collected at different \ndistances from the Monchegorsk Cu-Ni smelter along a pollution gradient.  \nSoil organic matter was determined using standard methods: loss on ignition \n(LOI) (Kola soils), DIN 38409 H1-3 (German soils), method by Tyurin \n(Arinushkina, 1973) (Oka river soils). \nReactive metal contents in solid soil were determined using a 0.43 mol.L-1 HNO3 \nextraction (Houba et al., 1985). Air-dry soil was shaken for 4 hours with 0,43 \nmol?L-1 HNO3 solution with a soil\u2013solution ratio (SSR) 1:10, followed by \ncentrifuging (3000 rpm, 10 min.) and filtering of solution via cellulose nitrate 0.45 \nm\u00b5 membrane filter (Schleicher&Sch\u00fcll).  Extracts were analyzed for Cd, Pb \nusing: ICP-MS for German and Kola soils and GF AAS for Oka river basin soils \n(for detailed info see Table 1).  \nSoil solution concentrations were approximated using four different methods:  \n\u00b7 Soil saturation extract (BSE) (German and Kola soils). Soils (air dry for \nGerman soils and at field moisture content in the case of Kola soils) were \npassed through 3mm sieve, and were equilibrated in plastic containers \n 6 \nwith deionised water added to bring soil to a moisture content of 100% of \nthe water holding capacity (WHC). After 48 hours (room temperature) the \nsoils were centrifuged at 3000 rpm during 10 minutes. The obtained \nsolutions were filtered through 0.45\u00b5m cellulose nitrate 0.45 \u00b5m \nmembrane filter (Schleicher&Sch\u00fcll). The pH was measured after soil \nsolution separation before and after filtering through a membrane filter.  \n\u00b7 Dilute salt solution extraction (CaCl2) (Kola and Oka river basin). Air \ndried soil materia l and a dilute salt solution (0.002 mol.L-1 CaCl2) were put \nin polypropylene centrifuge tubes and were gently shaken continuously \n(about 30 rpm) for 48 hours as it is recommended in (Houba et al., 1985). \nWe used a soil : solution ratio (SSR) of 1:2 for mineral horizons and 1:4 \nfor organic horizons. Thereafter the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm \nduring 10 minutes and the supernatant was filtered though a cellulose \nnitrate 0.45 \u00b5m  membrane filter (Schleicher&Sch\u00fcll). The pH was \nmeasured after centrifuging in the supernatant before and after filtering. \n\u00b7 Lysimetric waters (Kola soils). Lysimetric waters were collected with \ngravitational lysimeters below Oh and Bhf horizons of Podzols \n(unpublished data of N. Lukina (CEPF, Russia). Water samples were \ncollected during the same time period and at the same sampling sites as \nsoil samples used for soil solution extractions. \n\u00b7 Soil column -Donnan membrane technique (DMT) (Kola soils). This \nmethod allows the simultaneous determination of the free metal ion \nconcentration of several metals in a soil solution (approximated here with \n 7 \n0.002M Ca(NO3)2) which is equilibrated with the soil by continuous \npumping of the solution through a soil column.  \nAfter sampling soil samples were transported at field moisture content in a \ncool box at a temperature about +10\u00b0C. In the laboratory samples were \npassed though 3mm plastic sieve without drying and were kept in the dark \nat a temperature +4\u00b0C during 8-12 months. Moisture content (at 40\u00b0C) was \ndetermined before the experiments and taken into consideration for soil: \nsolution ratio calculations needed for soil column DMT experiment.  More \ninformation is given below in the section \u201cMetal activity measurement\u201d.  \nSoil solution pH was measured using a combination pH electrode (semimicro \nresearch-grade pH-electrode U-05711-11, Orion). For the BSE and CaCl2 extracts, \npH was measured both before and after filtering of the obtained solution extract. \nNo significant differences were found, and here we present data on pH after \nfiltering. \nTable 1 gives an overview of the different extraction techniques and chemical \nanalyses used for the different soil data sets. \nTable 1 \n \n2.2. Determination of free metal ion activities \nMetal activity calculation. Free ion activities of Cd and Pb in BSE, CaCl2-extracts \nand lysimetric waters were calculated from total metal concentrations in solution, \nconcentrations of major cations, anions, DOC, and pH using the speciation model \nWHAM\/Model VI (Tipping, 1998). We assumed that dissolved organic matter \n 8 \n(DOM) can be modelled as 65% active fulvic acid, which is an average value \nfound by optimizing the model for binding of Cu to natural DOM in surface \nwaters (Bryan et al., 2002) and is a reasonable estimate for the binding of several \nmetals including Cd and Pb to DOM in soil solutions (Weng et al., 2002). DOM \nwas calculated by assuming it to comprise 50% C by weight. \n  \nMetal activity measurement. For several samples (Podzols, organic and mineral \nhorizons, Kola Peninsula), metal activities were not only calculated, but also \nmeasured using the Soil Column -Donnan Membrane Technique (DMT) \ndescribed in Temminghoff et al. (2000) and Weng et al. (2001; 2002). The \nmethod is based on the assumption of (pseudo) equilibrium between a donor and \nan acceptor solution in a Donnan cell separated by a cation exchange membrane \n(55165 2U, BDH Laboratory Supplies, UK). The membrane allows fast transport \nof free cations but hinders the transport of complexed cations and anions.  For \nboth the donor and acceptor parts of the cell we used 0.002M Ca(NO3)2 solutions \nwhich were circulated using peristaltic pumps (Desaga and Gilson Minipuls 2 \nwith tygon tubes, 2.06 1.D.) with a speed of 2 ml\/min.  The donor solution was in \ncontact with the soil and circulated continuously from the bottom to the top \nthrough the soil column and the donor part of Donnan exchange cell. The acceptor \nsolution circulated through the acceptor part of the Donnan cell. The experiment \nwas run for 48 hours as recommended by Weng et al. (2001), who showed that in \nmost cases this time was enough to reach equilibrium in the soil system and \nDonnan cell. \n 9 \nFor mineral soils a SSR of 1:2 according to Weng (2001; 2002) was used. For \norganic horizons we had to increase this ratio to 1:7 because of the extremely high \nwater holding capacity of the organic material. We also modified the column \nusing a piston to prevent organic material from floating at the surface and \ndisturbing the constant circulation of solution though the column. After 48 hours \nsolution samples were collected from both donor and acceptor parts of the cell. \nThe pH was measured in the soil column using a combination pH electrode. \nActivities of Cd and Pb (aM don) in donor part (soil column) were calculated from \nthe activity of the metal in the acceptor part (aM acc) corrected for differences in \nionic strength using the ratio of Na activities in donor and acceptor (equation 1,  \n(Temminghoff et al., 2000)). The activities of Cd and Pb in acceptor and activities \nof Na in donor and acceptor were calculated from all measured total \nconcentrations using WHAM VI. \n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\n=\n\u00fa\n\u00fa\n\u00fb\n\u00f9\n\u00ea\n\u00ea\n\u00eb\n\u00e9\naccNa\ndonNa\naccM\ndonM\na\na\na\na\n_\n_\n2\/1\n_\n_ , (1) \nwhere aM and aNa are respectively the activities of metal (Cd2+ or Pb2+) and Na, in \nthe donor (don) or acceptor (acc) solution (mol.L-1) \n \n2.3. Transfer functions  \nThe general equation for both sets of transfer functions is: \n \nlog (aMe) = a0 + a1\u00b7log(QMe) + a2\u00b7log (%SOM) + a3\u00b7pH (2) \n \n 10 \nwhere: \nQMe = reactive metal concentration (mol.kg-1) \naMe = free metal ion activity (mol.L-1) \n%SOM = soil organic matter (weight %) \npH = pH of soil solution extract  \nBoth sets of transfer functions give a direct relation between the activity of the \nfree metal ion in soil solution and the metal content, organic matter content in the \nsoil solid phase and pH of the soil solution. The explanatory variables were \nlimited to parameters available in all the data sets.  \nThe following sets of transfer functions were validated:  \nTF1 (the Netherlands- UK).  \nThese transfer functions were derived by  Groenenberg et al. (in prep.) and \npresented at the Workshop on Critical Loads of Heavy Metals, UNECE \nConvention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ICP Modelling & \nMapping, Potsdam, Germany, 4-5 March 2004. Data for derivation were limited \nto datasets in which reactive metal was measured with 0.43 mol.L-1 HNO3 to have \na consistent dataset. Two large datasets (Tipping et al., 2003; R\u00f6mkens et al., \n2004) were used. The data set from Tipping et al. (2003) consists mainly of \nsamples from the top upland soils (United Kingdom) with high organic matter \ncontent. The data set from R\u00f6mkens et al. (2004) consists of a range of soils from \nthe Netherlands and includes also samples from deeper soil horizons. Free ion \nactivities were calculated using WHAM\/Model VI. \n 11 \nTF2 (the Netherlands- UK-Canada) (ICP Modelling and Mapping, 2004; Lofts \net al., 2004).  \nThese transfer functions were derived by Lofts et al. (2004) with the aim of \ncovering the ranges of Cd and Pb concentrations found in toxic endpoint data, and \nto include data as far as possible based on measured free metal ion. Soil metal \ncontents for the different data set used are extracted with different methods. Data \nare confined to data from top soils. Transfer functions are based on the results of \nstudies carried our in Canada, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.  \nFor more information on the datasets see Table 2, for details one is referred to the \noriginal publications. The regression coefficients are summarized in Table 3. \nTable 2 \nTable 3 \n2.4. Data analysis \nWe quantified the performance of both transfer functions with statistical \nmeasures. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the average of the difference \nbetween predicted and actual value in all test cases; it is the average prediction \nerror:  \nn\nop\nMAE\nn\ni\nii\u00e5\n=\n-\n= 1 , (2) \n \nwhere p and o are respectively the predicted and actual values of log(aMe).  \nThe coefficient of residual mass (CRM) indicates the tendency of the model to \nbias in prediction and is calculated as: \n 12 \n( )\n\u00e5\n\u00e5\n=\n=\n-\n=\nn\ni\ni\nn\ni\nii\no\nop\nCRM\n1\n1                                                                                               (3) \nA positive CRM indicates positive bias in prediction (tendency to overestimate \nactual values) and vice versa. \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Reactive metals \nOur use of 0.43 mol.l-1 HNO3 extraction as an approximation of reactive metal \ncontent in soil was determined in order to maintain measurement consistency, \ngiven the fact that this method was used for the most soils in the datasets for TF \nderivation (100% in the case of TF1 and 45% for Pb and 52 % for Cd in the case \nof TF 2, Table 2).  Extraction  with 0.43 mol.L-1 HNO3 to determine the \u2018reactive\u2019 \nor \u2018geochemical active\u2019 metal in soil was  used by several authors (Gooddy et al., \n1995; Temminghoff et al., 1997; Cances et al., 2003). Good agreement between \nEDTA and 0.43 mol.L-1 HNO3 extracted metal was found by Tipping et al. (2003) \nfor organic soils (>10% SOM), by Groenenberg et al. (2003) and De Vries et al. \n(2005) for a large range of forest and agricultural soils. With the 0.43 mol.L-1 \nHNO3\u2013extracted metal as input Dijkstra et al. (2004) found good predictions of \nsoil solution concentrations (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) from pH batch titrations ranging \nin pH from 2-12 using their \u201cmultisurface\u201d model. However, we would like to \nnote that the use of 0.43 mol.l-1 HNO3 for soils with high pH, and especially \n 13 \ncalcareous soils, could result in overestimation of reactive metal content due to \ndissolution of carbonates. Probably for neutral soils and soils with high pH an \nalternative would be to use a chelating agent e.g. EDTA,  or an isotope exchange \nmethod (Degryse et al, 2004, 2006, 2007, Young et al., 2000, Tye et al., 2003).   \n3.2. Comparison of different soil solution extraction methods  \nComparison of \u201csoil solutions\u201d extracted using different methods demonstrates in \nsome cases very big difference in DOC concentration and total metal \nconcentration. This difference can be illustrated using data on Kola Podzols \ncollected along a pollution gradient, where different extraction techniques were \napplied to the same soil samples (Table 4;  Tables 10-11, Appendix).  \nThe methods we used for soil solution extraction differed in terms of extract \nsolution composition, soil:solution ratio (SSR), method used for solid and liquid \nphases separation (centrifuging and filtering (BSE, CaCL2), or only filtering \n(DMT, Lysimetric waters)), soil pre-treatment (dry soil or moist). \nDOC and pH in different extracts. \nOrganic horizon. Mean DOC concentrations followed the trend CaCl2 extracts > \nBSE extracts > DMT extracts> lysimetric. Concentrations of DOC in lysimetric \nwater were lowest of all (on average about ten times lower then in CaCl2 extract). \nWe did not find any significant dependence of DOC concentration on soil \nsampling site distance from the smelter.  The pH in different extracts consistently \n 14 \ndecreased in soils in the vicinity of the smelter, but there were no significant \ndifferences in pH among different soil extracts, probably due to the pH buffering \neffect of DOC (Table 4).  \nMineral horizon. DOC concentrations in all extracts from the mineral horizons \nwere much lower than those in organic horizon extracts. Mean values followed \nthe trend CaCl2 ~ lysimetric > DMT ~ BSE. In general pH was highest in CaCl2 \nextracts and lowest in lysimetric waters. \nThe high DOC concentration in CaCl2 and BSE compared to DMT extracts and \nespecially lysimetric waters is probably due to mobilisation of organic matter \nfrom the soil due to centrifuging (Tiensing et al., 2001).  The effect appears \nespecially pronounced for horizons with very high organic matter contents. In \nmineral horizons, BSE extractions  and lysimeters resulted in solutions with \nsimilar DOC concentrations.  \nThe soil:solution ratio (SSR) can also influence the amount of extracted DOC. For \nexample, You et al. (1999) and Ponizovsky et al. (2006) observed positive \ncorrelations between DOC concentration and SSR. In our organic horizons, SSR \nwas 1:7 for DMT (1:7), 1:4 for CaCl2 extractions, and a mean of 1:3.7 for BSE \n(where soils were saturated to water holding capacity thus giving soil\u2013specific \nSSRs). For the mineral horizons, the SSR was 1:2 in the DMT experiment and for \nCaCl2 extraction, and on average 1:1.69 (0.59) for BSE.  \nHigher concentrations of DOC in CaCl2 extractions compared to BSE could be \ndue to the use of dried soils for CaCl2 extractions, and field-moist soil for BSE \n 15 \nand DMT experiments; soil drying has been shown to increase the mobilisation of \nsoil organic matter on extraction (Kaiser et al., 2001). \n \nMetal concentrations and activities in different extracts.  \nDifference between extracts in DOC resulted in a big difference in metal \nconcentration. In general metal concentrations in extracts were higher where DOC \nconcentrations were highest. However, this does not necessarily imply a direct \ncause\u2013effect relationship. The highest Cd and Pb concentrations were found in \nCaCl2 and BSE extracts, and the lowest in lysimetric waters (Oh horizon) and \nDMT (Cd - Bhf horizon).  The variability in metal and DOC concentrations, across \ndifferent soil solution extracts, was notably greater in the organic horizons than \nthe mineral horizons. \nVariability in lead FMI activity in the O horizons was smaller than for total soil \nsolution lead, probably due to the overriding influence of the total soil organic \nmatter content and pH on speciation of this metal in these soils. For Pb in O \nhorizon (and Cu - our unpublished data) we could not find any significant \ndifference in activity between different extracts. This effect was not observed for \nCd in the O and B horizons, nor for Pb in the B horizon. This suggests that other \nsoil and solution parameters, such as DOC and the total soil metal, were affecting \nthe FMI activities in these soils. In more details the effect of different techniques \nused for soil solution extraction will be discussed in our next paper. \n \n3.3. Dataset used for transfer function validation   \n \n 16 \nThe complete dataset consists of four groups of data: \u201cGerman soils\u201d, \u201cKola \nsoils\u201d, \u201cKola soils \u2013 DMT\u201d and \u201cOka river basin soils\u201d. A complete description of \nthe datasets is presented in the Appendix, Tables 8 \u2013 12. Table 5 gives a summary \nof the dataset: ranges of soil solution pH, soil organic matter, reactive metal \ncontent, dissolved metal concentrations (before and after exclusion of samples \nwith reactive or dissolved metal content below detection limits). In the case of \nlead, the following samples were excluded, mostly because of undetectable \nconcentrations of dissolved Pb: all samples of Rigosol-Pararenzina (Germany) \nwith pH (BSE) 7.61-7.76, Podzols (B horizon) from Kola Peninsula (CaCl2 \nextract, DMT), and Chernozem, Luvisols, and half of Podzoluvisols from Oka \nriver basin with pH higher then 4.6 (CaCl2). This resulted in a decrease of the pH \nrange of the dataset from 2.98\u20137.75 to 2.98\u20135.36 (Table 5). In the case of Cd, \nseven samples were excluded due to undetectable concentrations in the soil \nsolution: Rigosol-Pararenzina (30-60cm) with pH (BSE) 7.71 (Germany), \nChernozem with pH 6.47 from Oka river basin, and some mineral horizon \nsamples from the Kola Peninsula (DMT) were excluded due to Cd concentration \nin acceptor being below detection.  \nTable 5 \n3.4. Validation of FMI activities calculated with WHAM VI using the results \nof DMT experiments.  \n \nMetal speciation calculations using WHAM were verified by comparing \ncalculated FMI total activities with ones measured using DMT. Activities of Pb2+ \n 17 \nand Cd2+ were calculated using data on total dissolved metal concentrations, pH \nand DOC measured in soil column in the end of DMT experiment. \nTable 6 \nFig 1 \n The mean absolute error (MAE) in the calculation of the log FMI for cadmium \nwas 0.37 for Cd and 0.46 for Pb (Table 6). The results indicated a tendency for \nWHAM to underestimate DMT\u2013measured metal activities in the lower part of the \nobserved range of activities, and to overestimate in the higher part of the observed \nrange (Figure 1).. For the B horizon only a limited number of data points, for Cd \nonly, were available. Predicted activities were consistently higher than \nobservations. However according to the low CRMs calculated for both metals \n(respectively -0.02 and 0.005) there was on average no significant over- or \nunderestimation in predicted activities compared to measurements with DMT \n(Table 6). \nThe deviations between predicted and measured Cd2+ and Pb2+ activities were as \napproximately equal to the deviations observed by Weng et al. (2002) in their \ncomparison of model\u2013predicted and DMT\u2013measured FMI activities. This \ndeviation was due both to errors in the model predictions as well as errors in the \nactivity measurements. In another paper (Pampura et al., 2006) we showed mean \nabsolute deviations between Cu2+ activities measured with DMT and those \ncalculated with WHAM VI and NICA of 0.3 and 0.4 respectively.. We also \ndemonstrated an MAE of 0.4 between activity values determined using DMT and \nmeasured with a Cu-selective electrode.  \n 18 \n \n3.5. Transfer function validation  \n \nThe applicability of both transfer functions was evaluated using a comparison of \nTF-predicted and observed free metal ion concentrations (computed from \nmeasured total concentrations (WHAM VI) or measured free ion concentrations \n(DMT)) (Figure 2.). The graphs show both the one order of magnitude interval \nand the 95% confidence interval of the regression function. The 95% confidence \ninterval is calculated from the standard error of prediction (se(Y)) of each transfer \nfunction according to: \n \nConf . Interval = Y-est. \u00b1 tn-2se(Y) ,                                                                      (4) \n \nwhere Y-est is the predicted activity of the transfer function, and tn-2 is equal to \n1.96 (n>120) for a 95% confidence interval. The width of the band shows how \nwell the TF fits the data it is derived from. \n \nIt should be noted that TF2 was partly derived in terms of the free ion \nconcentration [M2+] since some of the data used free ion expressed as a \nconcentration rather than activity, whereas TF1 and our experimental dataset \nexpress free metal ion in terms of activity. This disagreement does not \nsignificantly influence the results. In soil solution extracts the difference in \nlog(FMI activity) and log(FMI concentration) is expected to be around 0.13 \n 19 \n(calculated with the Davies equation, Stumm and Morgan, 1981) with activities \nlower than concentrations. \nFigure 2 \n \nVisual evaluation shows considerable scatter for both Cd and Pb. However \ntransfer functions for Pb give better predictions than those for Cd for which the \nscatter is largest (Figure. 2). This is also reflected by the smaller MAE computed \nfor Pb for both TF1 and TF2 (Table 7). \nTable 7 \n \nCd. From the computed CRM it follows that both TF1 and TF2 underestimate the \nlog FMI activity for Cd by on average 7% and 4%, respectively. On the basis of  \nthe MAE, TF2 gives better results for Cd than TF1 because the average deviation \nis smaller for TF2 than for TF1 (Table 7). For TF1 about 23% of the points are \noutside the one order of magnitude int erval and 9% for TF2. To see if there is any \nsystematic deviation we looked for which soils the deviation is larger than the \nMAE. For both TFs the error is systematically larger for B horizons (Podzols, \nBrown soils) and it is nearly always smaller for O and A horizons. Errors for B \nhorizons are especially large in case of TF1. If B horizons are left out the both \nTF\u2019s perform about equal. Specifically the agreement is poor for TF1 for all \nsamples of Rigosol-Pararendzina, samples from B horizons of Eutric and  Gleyic \nCambisols (BSE extraction) and partially samples of Kola Podzol (BSE and CaCl2 \nextraction). For TF2 predictions are poor for Bv horizons of Eutric Cambisol, \nRigosol-Pararendsina (30-60cm) and some BSE extracts of O horizon of Kola \nPodzols.  \n 20 \nPb. The results for Pb show considerable scatter, however the predicted values are \ngenerally within an order of magnitude of observation for both transfer functions, \nand for both functions nearly all the data are within the 95% confidence intervals. \nTF1 on average overestimates the Pb FMI activities slightly whereas TF2 tend to \nunderestimate the log FMI. According to the MAE (Table 7), TF2 gives \nsomewhat better predictions than TF1. Again the error in the prediction is in \ngeneral larger for the B horizons, but far less pronounced than for Cd. TF2 shows \na larger than average prediction deviation for peat soils. \n \nComparison of metal activity prediction with transfer functions and with \nWHAM VI using the results of DMT measurements.  \nWe tested the performance of TF2 and compared it with the performance of the \nWHAM VI model to predict FMI activities for those solutions in which the \nactivity was measured using DMT. Table 6 gives the model performance \nparameters for WHAM VI and TF2. \nTable 6 \n \nFor Cd predictions with TF2 and WHAM VI are about equal with a slightly better \nprediction with WHAM. For Pb FMI activity prediction is better in the case of \nWHAM, although even with this model the average deviation on a log scale is \n0.46. \n \nComparison of TF-predicted and observed activities in different types of soil \nsolution extracts. \n 21 \n Figure 3 illustrates the scatter of free metal concentrations resulting from the use \nof different approaches to approximate soil solution in Podzols of the Kola \nPeninsula (BSE, CaCl2, lysimetric waters, DMT).                                      \n Figure 3 \nComparison of TF2\u2013predicted Cd2+ and Pb2+ activities with observed values in \ndifferent soil solution extracts (calculated from total dissolved concentrations with \nWHAM VI in BSE, CaCl2 and lysimetric waters, and measured with DMT) \ndemonstrates that for nearly all samples and for both metals, agreement is within  \none order of magnitude. This range of variation corresponds quite well to the 95% \nconfidence intervals of TF2. For lead, the prediction for CaCl2 extracts and \nlysimetric waters was a little better than for soil saturation extracts and DMT \nmeasurement. In the case of Cd, a high variability of FMI activities was found in \nBSE extracts, and predictions were poorer compared to CaCl2, and lysimetric \nwaters. A reasonable agreement between values predicted with TF2 and values \nmeasured with DMT was found, however in all cases Pb activities measured with \nDMT were lower and Cd activities were higher than those predicted with transfer \nfunctions. The variation due to different methods of soil solution sampling is \nwithin the variation of the transfer functions. \nWe would draw the following main conclusions from this work:  \n\u00b7 Since a significant amount of data was excluded from the Pb dataset because \nof undetectable dissolved metal concentrations in soil solutions, the validation \nof the transfer functions for Pb was limited to the acid and slightly acid pH \nrange.  \n 22 \n\u00b7 for Cd predictions are poor for the B horizon especially for TF1. Transfer \nfunction predictions for organic and A horizons are reasonably good. Best \nagreement between predicted values and those observed (either measured or \ncalculated from total concentrations using WHAM VI) was found for TF2; \n\u00b7 for Pb reasonable agreement was found between activity of free metal ion \npredicted by both TF1 and TF2 and FMI activity measured or calculated from \ntotal concentrations in soil solutions; \n\u00b7 prediction with transfer functions is better for Pb than for Cd, and for organic \nhorizon than for mineral one; \n\u00b7 deviations between values of free metal (Cd and Pb) ion activities observed in \ndifferent soil solution extracts (BSE, CaCl2, Lysimetric waters, DMT) and \nthose ones predicted with TF are within the 95% confidence interval of the \ntransfer functions. Transfer functions can be used equa lly well for all these \nextracts; \n\u00b7 comparison of FMI activity measured with DMT with activity predicted using \nWHAM VI and TF2 demonstrated that for Cd both models (WHAM and TF) \nwere nearly equal. In the case of Pb WHAM-predictions demonstrated better \nagreement with DMT measurements than TF-predictions. \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe research was funded by Grant NWO 047.014.002, Grant INTAS 01-2213, \nGrant RFBR ?  04-05-64613.
