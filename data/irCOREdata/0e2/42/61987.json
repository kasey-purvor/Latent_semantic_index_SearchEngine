This \ndemands improved understanding to facilitate appropriate planning to minimize potential \nlosses.  With this in mind, the World Climate Research Programme organized a \nworkshop (held June 2006) to document current understanding and to identify research \nand observations required to reduce current uncertainties associated with sea-level rise \nand variability.  While sea levels have varied by over 120 m during glacial\/interglacial \ncycles, there has been little net rise over the past several millennia until the 19th century \nand early 20th century when geological and tide-gauge data indicate an increase in the \nrate of sea-level rise.  Recent satellite-altimeter data and tide-gauge data indicate sea \nlevels are now rising at over 3 mm yr-1.  The major contributions to 20th and 21st century \nsea-level rise are thought to be a result of ocean thermal expansion and melting of \nglaciers and ice caps.  Ice sheets are thought to have been a minor contributor to 20th \ncentury sea-level rise but are potentially the largest contributor in the longer-term.  Sea \nlevels are currently rising at the upper limit of the projections of the Third Assessment \nReport of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and there is increasing \nconcern of potentially large ice-sheet contributions during the 21st century and beyond, \nparticularly if greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated.  A suite of ongoing satellite \nand in situ observational activities need to be sustained and new activities supported.  To \nthe extent that we are able to sustain these observations, research programmes utilizing \nthe resulting data should be able to significantly improve our understanding and narrow \nprojections of future sea-level rise and variability.   \n 4\nIntroduction \n \nCoastal zones have changed profoundly during the 20th century, primarily due to growing \npopulations and increasing urbanization and in 1990, 23% of the world\u2019s population (or \n1.2 billion people) lived both within a 100 km distance and 100 m elevation of the coast \nat densities about three times higher than the global average (Small and Nicholls 2003).  \nAs a consequence the coastal zone and its inhabitants are becoming increasingly \nvulnerable to flooding and storm events, in particular against a background of rising sea \nlevel. \n \nSea-level rise is an important aspect of anthropogenic climate change.  By 2010, 20 out \nof 30 mega-cities will be on the coast, with many threatened by sea-level rise (Nicholls \n1995).  With coastal development continuing at a rapid pace, society is becoming \nincreasingly vulnerable to sea-level rise and variability\u2014as Hurricane Katrina \ndemonstrated in New Orleans in 2005 (for example Graumann et al. 2005).  For projected \nsea-level rise during the 21st century, many millions of people will have to respond to \ncoastal flooding events each year.  With appropriate planning and adaptation measures, \nthis number can be reduced dramatically (Nicholls et al. this volume).  Rising sea levels \nwill contribute to increased severity of storm-surge events, even if storm intensities do \nnot increase in response to the warming of the oceans.  Rising sea levels will also \ncontribute to the recession of the world\u2019s sandy beaches, 70% of which have been \nretreating over the past century with less than 10% prograding (Bird 1993).  Low-lying \nislands are also vulnerable. \n 5\n \nAn improved understanding of sea-level rise and variability will help reduce the \nuncertainties associated with sea-level rise projections, thus contributing to more \neffective coastal planning and management.  Adaptation measures to minimize the \npotential losses include strengthened building codes, restrictions on where, what and how \nto build, and developing local infrastructures that is able to cope better with flooding.   \n \nThere are significant uncertainties in understanding how sea level has changed on \nmillennial to decadal time scales and what contributes to this change.  As a result, there \nare significant uncertainties about how sea level will change in the future.  To address \nthese uncertainties, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) organised a \nworkshop on Understanding Sea-level Rise and Variability.  The workshop, supported by \nmany sponsors and hosted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission at \nUNESCO headquarters in Paris June 6-9, 2006, brought together representatives from all \nrelevant disciplines.  In total, 163 scientists from 29 countries, including participants \nfrom developing nations and students as well as experienced research scientists and \nleading program managers, attended the Workshop.  The goals of the Workshop were to \nidentify the uncertainties associated with past and future sea-level rise and variability, as \nwell as the research and observational activities needed for narrowing these uncertainties.  \nThe Workshop was also conducted in support of the Global Earth Observation System of \nSystems (GEOSS) 10-Year Implementation Plan (http:\/\/earthobservations.org\/docs\/10-\nYear%20Implementation%20Plan.pdf); as such, it helped develop international and \n 6\ninterdisciplinary scientific consensus for those observational requirements needed to \naddress sea-level rise and its variability.   \n \nAs an introduction to this volume on sea-level rise, we will draw heavily on the results \nfrom the workshop (Church et al. 2007), including the workshop\u2019s statement available at \nhttp:\/\/wcrp.wmo.int\/AP_SeaLevel.html and presentations and posters at the workshop.  \nWe will briefly review historical sea-level changes, attempting to synthesise the various \nestimates derived from different observational methods.  We also review the \ncontributions to 20th century sea-level rise, briefly discuss the impacts of sea-level rise \nand the outlook for the future.   \n \nHistorical sea-level rise \n \nSea level has varied by more than 120 m during glacial-interglacial cycles (Figure 1) as \nthe major ice sheets formed and decayed, particularly in high northern-hemisphere \nlatitudes (Lambeck and Chappell 2001).  Paleo data indicate that sea level was 4 to 6 m \n(or more) above present day sea levels during the last interglacial period, about 125,000 \nyears ago (Stirling et al. 1998; Overpeck et al. 2006).  Climate and ice-sheet model \nsimulations (Otto-Bleisner et al. 2006) indicate that Greenland was about 3\u00b0 C warmer \nthan today and that the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets contributed 2.2 to 3.4 m to the \nhigher sea level, with the majority of the higher sea level coming from the partial melting \nof the Greenland ice sheet.  From the last interglacial to about 20,000 years ago sea level \nfell by over 120 m.  Following the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago, sea \n 7\nlevel rose by more than 120 m, at an average rate of about 10 mm yr-1 (1 m per century), \nand with peak rates of about 40 mm yr-1 (4 m per century), until about 7,000 years ago \n(Fairbanks, 1989; Lambeck et al. 2002).  Sea level rose much more slowly over the past \n7,000 years (Figure 1b; Lambeck 2002).  Paleo data over centuries to millenia constrain \nestimates of sea-level change and thus of on-going ice-sheet contributions.  For example, \nsea level about 2,000 years ago can be deduced by examining fish tanks built by the \nancient Romans.  Because the tanks had to be at sea level for the sluice gates to function, \none can precisely estimate sea level during the period of their use.  Comparison of this \nlevel with historical records (after correcting for land motion) indicates that there has \nbeen little net change in sea level from 2000 years ago until the start of the 19th century \n(Lambeck et al. 2004).  \n \nChanges in local sea level estimated from sediment cores collected in salt marshes reveal \nan increase in the rate of sea-level rise in the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean during \nthe 19th century and early 20th century (Donelly et al. 2004; Gehrels et al. 2005; Gehrels \net al. 2006), consistent with the few long tide-gauge records from Europe and North \nAmerica (Woodworth 1999).  Correcting these local sea-level trends for estimates of \nlarge-scale vertical land motion associated with changing surface loads on the earth \n(GIA, glacial isostatic adjustment) results in rates of sea-level rise close to zero in the \nearly part of the sedimentary record and in good agreement with the tide-gauge data for \nthe latter part of the record.  Plotting these early trends as zero (Figure 2) also results in \ngood agreement between the 20th century estimates of sea-level rise determined from the \nsedimentary record and from tide gauges (see below).   \n 8\n \nFrom 1993 to the end of 2006, near-global measurements of sea level (between 66\u00b0N and \n66\u00b0S) made by high precision satellite altimeters indicate global average sea level has \nbeen rising at 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 mm yr-1 (Beckley et al. 2007; Figure 3a; Unless stated otherwise, \nall errors estimates quoted are one standard deviation).  This rate is faster (by almost a \nfactor of two) than the average rate of rise during the 20th century, which in turn was an \norder of magnitude larger than the rate of rise over the two millennia prior to the 18th \ncentury.  Church and White (2006) combined empirical orthogonal functions calculated \nfrom satellite altimeter data with coastal and island tide-gauge data (Woodworth and \nPlayer 2003), corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment (e.g. Davis and Mitrovica 1996) to \nestimate (\u2018reconstruct\u2019) global average sea level.  They showed that sea level rose by just \nunder 20 cm between 1870 and 2001, at an average rate of 1.7 mm yr-1 during the 20th \ncentury and with an increase in the rate of rise over this period (Figure 3).  Jevrejeva et al. \n(2006) used a different technique but obtained a similar global curve.  The time series of \nglobal-averaged sea level is consistent with the geological data (Figure 2), the few long \nrecords of sea level from coastal tide gauges and for the period of high-quality satellite-\naltimeter data since 1993 (Figure 3).   \n \nEstimates of sea-level trends during 20 year periods, with the start of each period \nincremented by one year, indicate significant variability in the rate of sea-level rise.  Prior \nto the 1930s, the rate of sea-level rise was generally less than 1 mm yr-1 (Figure 3b).  \nFrom the late 1930s to the late 1950s, the rate of sea-level rise was greater than 2 mm yr-\n1, peaking at about 2.5 mm yr-1.  From 1963 to 1991 there were a series of explosive \n 9\nvolcanic eruptions which caused cooling (and hence contraction) of the upper ocean and \npresumably offsetting some of the increase in sea-level rise that would otherwise have \nbeen present (Church et al. 2005; Church and White 2006; Gregory et al. 2006; Gleckler \net al. 2006a and b) and the rate of sea-level rise fell to less than 2 mm yr-1 from the late \n1950s to the mid-to-late 1980s.  For the 20 year periods centred on 1992 and later, the \nrate of sea-level rise is close to the value estimated using satellite altimeters of over 3 mm \nyr-1.  Indeed, the rate of rise over the five most recent 20-year periods is 25% greater than \nthe next largest set of values during the 1940s.  A histogram of these rates of sea-level \nrise has a mean value of about 1.4 mm yr-1 and the five most recent values are at the \nextreme end of the histogram at about two standard deviations from the mean value.  \nThese results suggest that the rate of global averaged sea-level rise since the mid-1980s is \nindeed unusual, in agreement with Holgate and Woodworth (2004) who pointed to the \nanomalous 1990s rise based on tide-gauge data.  Woodworth et al. (submitted) recently \nreviewed the evidence of changes in the rate of sea-level rise and concluded there was a \nstrong acceleration in the early 20th century, and a weaker deceleration during the mid- to \nlate 20th century, which Church et al. (2005) and Church and White (2006) argue is at \nleast partly a result of explosive volcanic eruptions.   \n \nThe satellite-altimeter data indicate that the rate of rise is not uniform around the globe.  \nThe spatial patterns reflect climate variability with a greater rate of rise in the western \nPacific compared with the eastern Pacific as a result of the transition from El Ni\u00f1o-like \nconditions at the start of the satellite altimeter record to more La Ni\u00f1a-like conditions at \nthe end of the satellite altimeter record (Figure 4a).  There are also local maxima in the \n 10\nrate of sea-level rise at the poleward boundaries of the subtropical gyres in the South and \nNorth Pacific Ocean and in the Indian Ocean, which appear as maxima at about 40\u00b0N and \n40\u00b0S in the zonal average of the rate of sea-level rise.  In the southern hemisphere, this is \na result of the decadal increase of the Southern Annular mode (SAM), which results in \nenhanced Ekman convergence and downward displacement of isopycnals at these \nlatitudes (Roemmich et al. 2007).  Over the 1950 to 2000 period, the reconstructed sea \nlevels (Church et al. 2004) also indicate that the rate of sea-level rise is not globally \nuniform, but the short-term climate variability (which are clearly seen in the altimeter \nrecord), such as El Ni\u00f1o\/La Ni\u00f1a and other climate variability, have a weaker impact on \nthe multi-decadal trends (Church et al., 2004).   \n \nImpacts of sea-level rise are determined by sea-level changes relative to the local land \nrather than the global-average sea-level changes discussed above.  Vertical land \nmovements can occur through natural geological processes resulting in uplift or \nsubmergence, or from man-made influences, usually resulting in submergence.  The \nprocess with the largest spatial scale (glacial isostatic adjustment, GIA) results from \nglobal-scale changes in mass loading of the Earth\u2019s surface as a result of the melting of \nice sheets and the associated increased mass of the oceans.  Today, there are ongoing \nviscoelastic changes in the solid earth as a result of the changing loads of the ice sheets \nduring the last glacial\/interglacial cycle (Lambeck and Nakiboglu 1984; Peltier 1998) and \nthe present day elastic response to recent melting (Mitrovica et al. 2001).  In addition to \nthese large-scale motions, there are local tectonic motions.  In a number of deltaic regions \nwith high population densities, ground water withdrawal, oil and gas extraction, \n 11\ncompacting sediments and reduced supply of new sediments as a result of dam building \nand altered river flows (Ericson et al. 2006) results in significant subsidence rates, further \nexacerbating the impact of sea-level rise.   \n \nContributions to 20th century sea-level rise \n \nThe two main reasons for sea-level rise are thermal expansion of ocean waters as they \nwarm, and increase in the ocean mass, principally from land-based sources of ice \n(glaciers and ice caps, and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica). Global warming \nfrom increasing greenhouse gas concentrations is a significant driver of both \ncontributions to sea-level rise.  \n \nOcean-thermal expansion \n \nFor the 1993 to 2003 period, a variety of analysis techniques have been used to estimate \nthe rate of global-averaged and regional ocean-thermal expansion.  The results of \nAntonov et al. (2005) and Ishii et al. (2006) indicate a rate of ocean thermal expansion of \nabout 1.2 mm yr-1.  A number of studies have shown that altimetric sea-level heights are \nhighly correlated with heat content and steric heights (White and Tai, 1995, Gilson et al., \n1998, Willis et al., 2003, 2004).  This correlation can be exploited to improve estimates \nof ocean thermal expansion and heat content (0-750 m) as shown by Willis et al. (2004).  \nThe altimetric height correlation with subsurface temperature was used to form a first \nguess of the heat-content (or thermosteric height) variability, and then anomalies from \n 12\nthis first guess were objectively mapped using the subsurface data.  The resultant estimate \nof ocean thermal expansion for 1993 to 2003 (Willis et al. 2004) was 1.6 mm yr-1.   \n \nAn alternative approach to fill the gaps in the sparse in situ data base is a reconstruction \nof ocean thermal expansion based on empirical orthogonal functions in an approach \nsimilar to that used by Church et al. (2004) to estimate changes in sea level (Domingues \net al. submitted).   \n \nWhile these and other estimates have similar rates averaged over 1993-2003, there are \nsignificant interannual differences between the estimates and all are strongly dependent \non eXpendable-Bathy-Thermograph (XBT) data.  When the recent Argo data was added \nto this time series there was an apparent ocean cooling since 2003 (Lyman et al. 2006), \nwhich has since been shown to be the result of a time-variable warm bias in the XBT \ndata, resulting in too large an estimate of thermal expansion from 1993 to 2003, and \nerrors in the Argo data (Willis et al. 2007), resulting in unrealistic estimates of ocean \ncooling since 2003.  Wijffels et al. (2008) has recently shown that the significant XBT \nwarm biases identified by Gouretski and Koltermann (2007) are primarily a result of \nerrors in the XBT fall rate which varies over decades (presumably as a result of small \nchanges in the manufacture of the XBTs).  Revised estimates of ocean thermal expansion \nfor the upper 700 m are currently being computed and are likely to be lower than earlier \nestimates; revised estimates may be a little less than 1 mm yr-1 for 1993 to 2003.   \n \n 13\nThe regional distribution of sea-level variability and rise is largely a result of the regional \ndistribution of ocean thermal expansion.  As a result, the spatial pattern of trends (relative \nto their respective global means) of sea-level rise measured by satellite altimeter (Figure \n4a) and ocean thermal-expansion computed using a reduced space optimal interpolation \ntechnique (Figure 4b; Domingues et al. submitted) are very similar.  In constructing \nFigure 4b, spatial empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) computed from altimeter data \nwere used but similar results are found when EOFs computed from the dynamic height \ndata of Guinehut et al. (2006) are used.   \n \nFrom 1955 to 2003, Antonov et al. (2005) estimated ocean thermal expansion over the \nupper 700 m contributed about 0.3 mm yr-1 to sea-level rise and 0.4 mm yr-1 over 3000 m, \nless than 25% of the observed rise over the same period.  However, there are significant \nXBT biases in the data set and there are major gaps in the data base.  The estimated rate \nof thermal expansion is sensitive to how these data gaps are filled (see also AchutaRao et \nal. 2007).  A reconstruction of ocean thermal expansion based on empirical orthogonal \nfunctions using the XBT fall rate corrections of Wijffels et al. (2008) results in a \nsomewhat larger value than earlier estimates (Domingues et al. submitted), about 0.5 mm \nyr-1 for the upper 700 m for 1960 to 2003.  Gille (2008) found a similar sensitivity to gaps \nin the observational data base in the Southern Ocean and concluded that the previous \nresults (Antonov et al. 2005) were biased low.   \n \nGlaciers and ice caps \n \n 14\nGlaciers and ice caps (i.e. excluding the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets) together \ncontain enough water to raise sea level by between 15 and 37 cm (Lemke et al. 2007).  \nDespite their size, they are thought to be the second largest contributor to sea-level rise \nduring the 20th century, and are likely to be the second largest during at least the early \n21st century (Meier et al. 2007).  Kaser et al. (2006) summarise recent estimates of the \ncontribution of the melting of glaciers and ice caps to sea-level rise.  Including the \nsmaller glaciers surrounding Greenland and Antarctica, they estimate a contribution to \nsea-level rise of about 0.4 mm yr-1 from 1961 to 1990 increasing to about 1.0 mm yr-1 \nfrom 2001-2004.  The most important impact is from large glaciers in regions with heavy \nprecipitation, such as the coastal mountains around the Gulf of Alaska, Patagonia and \nTierra del Fuego in South America.  The time-series from Dyurgerov and Meier (2005, \nour Figure 5) is typical of the estimates and shows the increasing contribution of glaciers \nand ice caps since 1960.  Lemke et al. (2007) conclude that the glacier wastage is likely \nto have been a response to post-1970 warming.  One of the estimates summarized by \nKaser et al., that of Cogley (2005), shows a larger contribution to sea-level rise in the \n1940s (but with larger error bars) at the same time as global averaged sea level is \nestimated to be rising relatively rapidly (Figure 3).   \n \nThe Ice Sheets of Greenland and Antarctica \n \nThe ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have the potential to make the largest \ncontribution to sea-level rise, but they are also the greatest source of uncertainty.  At the \ntime of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the IPCC (Church et al. 2001), direct \n 15\nobservational estimates of the balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets were too \nimprecise to be of value in assessing the global sea-level budget.  Instead, the TAR relied \non models to estimate that the ice sheets could be contributing anywhere between zero \nand 0.5 mm yr-1 to 20th century sea-level rise.  Since 1990, there has been a rapid increase \nin the quantity and quality of remote sensing data available for estimating changes in the \nmass of both ice sheets.  For Greenland, new estimates depend on the use of airborne \nlaser altimeters, satellite altimeters (Krabill et al. 2004; Thomas et al., 2006), synthetic \naperture radar (Rignot and Kangaratnam, 2006) and most recently time variable gravity \nmeasurements (Velicogna and Wahr 2005; Ramillien et al. 2006; Luthcke et al. 2006; \nChen et al. 2006). \n \nSince 1990 there has been increased snow accumulation at high elevation on the \nGreenland ice sheet (Zwally et al. 2005), while at lower elevation there has been more \nwidespread surface melting and a significant increase in the flow of outlet glaciers \n(Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006).  The net result is a decrease in the mass of the \nGreenland ice sheet \u2014 a positive contribution to sea-level rise of perhaps \n0.2 \u00b1 0.1 mm yr-1 (90% confidence range; Lemke et al. 2007) \u2014 and suggestions of an \nacceleration of this contribution (Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006; Chen et al. 2006).  \nHowever, the time series are short and the estimates may not be representative of longer \nperiods and of the twentieth century as a whole.   \n \nFor the Antarctic Ice Sheet, the uncertainty is even larger.  As temperatures increase, \nsnowfall is projected to increase, partially offsetting other contributions to sea-level rise.  \n 16\nHowever, no significant increase in snowfall has been detected over the last 50 years \n(Monaghan et al. 2006).  The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is grounded below sea-level and \nwarm ocean water can penetrate beneath the fringing ice shelves, melting the ice sheet at \nits base and leading to increased flow of outlet glaciers (Thomas et al. 2004), as observed \non the Antarctic Peninsular following the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf (Scambos et \nal. 2004; Rignot et al. 2004).  However, those processes are poorly understood and thus \nnot adequately modelled.  Since 1993, moderate increases in ice thickness in East \nAntarctica (Zwally et al. 2005; Davis et al. 2005) do not appear to compensate for the \nmass loss due to the increased glacier flow on the Antarctic Peninsula and the West \nAntarctic Ice Sheet (Zwally et al. 2005; Davis et al., 2005; Joughin et al. 2003; Thomas et \nal. 2004).  The net result is estimated to be a contribution to sea-level rise of 0.2 \u00b1 0.4 \nmm yr-1 (90% confidence range; Lemke et al. 2007).  Note also that modelling studies \n(e.g. Huybrechts and de Wolde 1999) argue that because of the very long response time \nof ice sheets, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is still responding to changes since the last ice age \nand thus contributing to present day sea-level rise.   \n \nChanges in Terrestrial storage \n \nAs part of the hydrological cycle, water is exchanged between the oceans and \n\u201creservoirs\u201d on land (lakes, rivers, soil moisture, groundwater, ice sheets, permafrost).  \nNatural (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o, volcanic eruptions), man-made (e.g. dams, irrigation) and climate-\ndriven changes to precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture and glaciers and ice caps affect \nthis cycle.   \n 17\n \nThe largest terrestrial storage changes arising from climate variations on interannual to \ndecadal scales are a result of changes in groundwater storage, followed by changes in soil \nmoisture and then snow cover (Ngo-duc et al. 2005; Milly et al. 2003).  Ngo-duc et al. \n(2005) found that during the 1970s about 4 mm (equivalent sea level) more than normal \nwas held in terrestrial storage, but over the 50 year period 1950 to 2000 there was little \nnet change.  For the period since the early 1990s, a range of terrestrial water models have \nbeen inter-compared and GRACE gravity data is also being used to test these models and \nto directly estimate changes in terrestrial water storage.   \n \nAs well as these climate-driven changes in terrestrial water storage, human activities also \naffect terrestrial storage and sea level.  These activities include mining of groundwater, \ndeforestation, desertification, wetland loss or drainage, surface water diversion and dam \nbuilding.  However, the sum of these terms is poorly known.  The contribution from \nsedimentation in the ocean is small (Church et al., 2001).   \n \nReducing Uncertainties \n \nImproving our understanding of sea-level rise and variability, as well as reducing the \nassociated uncertainties, depends critically on the availability of adequate observations.  \nThe WCRP workshop (http:\/\/wcrp.ipsl.jussieu.fr\/Workshops\/SeaLevel\/), helped develop \ninternational scientific consensus for those observational requirements needed to address \nsea-level rise and its variability.  These requirements include sustaining existing \n 18\nsystematic observations, as well as the development of new and improved observing \nsystems. \n \nAn overarching observational requirement is the need for an open data policy, together \nwith timely, unrestricted access for all.  Using the Argo and Jason policies \n(http:\/\/www.coriolis.eu.org\/cdc\/argo\/argo_data_management_handbook.pdf and \nhttp:\/\/podaac-www.jpl.nasa.gov\/about\/) as a guide, this access would include real-time, \nhigh-frequency sea-level data from the GLOSS tide gauges and co-located GPS stations, \nas well as data from satellite missions and in situ observing systems.  Further \nrequirements include the need for appropriate data archaeology\u2014retrieving and making \naccessible historical, paper-based sea-level records, especially those extending over long \nperiods and in the Southern Hemisphere.  An immediate priority for paper records is \nelectronic scanning and making them available for subsequent digitization.  Moreover, \nsatellite observations need to be as continuous as possible, with overlap between \nsuccessive missions.  There also needs to be a corresponding collection of appropriate in \nsitu observations for calibration and validation.  Ongoing satellite and in situ observing \nsystems should adhere to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) observing \nprinciples (http:\/\/gosic.org\/GCOS\/GCOS climate_monitoring_principles.htm). \n \nThe existing systems that should be sustained include those observing sea level \u2013 the \nJason series of satellite altimeters, as well as completing the GLOSS network of \napproximately 300 gauges (each with high-frequency sampling, real-time reporting, and \ngeodetic positioning).  In order to estimate the change in sea level due to steric effects, \n 19\nthe Argo array \u2013 which achieved global coverage of the ice-free oceans with 3,000 \nprofiling floats in November 2007 \u2013 needs to be sustained.  To estimate the change in sea \nlevel due to changes in ocean mass due to melting ice caps and glaciers and changes in \nterrestrial water storage, observations of the time-varying gravity field from GRACE \nneed to be sustained. \n \nAdditional existing systems to be sustained are those required to observe changes in ice \nsheet and glacier topography and thickness: satellites utilizing radar (e.g., Envisat, GFO \nand Sentinel-3) and laser (ICESat and, once launched, CryoSat-2) altimeters, \ncomplemented by aircraft and in situ observations.  All of these measurements require \nthat the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), which integrates the geodetic \ncomponents \u2013 SLR, VLBI, DORIS, and GNSS (GPS, together with GLONASS & \nGalileo once launched), must be made more robust and stable than is currently the case.  \nFinally, higher spatial resolutions observations from GOCE, once launched, and other \nstand-alone missions are needed to obtain improved models of the planetary gravity field, \nincluding its temporal variation, such that we can separate changes in sea-surface shape, \nwhich reflect mass redistribution and density changes from changes in the geopotential \nwhich reflect the mass distribution only.   \n \nNew and improved observing systems which need to be developed include those directed \nat changes in the ocean volume, specifically extending the Argo-type capability to enable \nthe collection of similar observations under the sea ice, as well as the design and \nimplementation of an effort to obtain observations for the deep ocean.  Based on \n 20\nexperience gained with radar and laser satellite altimeters, the development of a suitable \nfollow-on capability is needed to improve observations of ice sheet and glacier \ntopography.  Access to InSAR data and ongoing InSAR missions are needed to observe \nflow rates in glaciers and ice sheets.  Finally, the development of an advanced wide-\nswath altimeter is needed to observe: \n\u2022 sea level associated with the oceanic mesoscale field, coastal variability, and \nmarine geoid\/bathymetry, \n\u2022 surface water levels on land (Alsdorf et al. 2007) and their changes in space and \ntime and \n\u2022  surface topography of glaciers and ice sheets. \n \nThe Impacts of sea-level rise \n \nRelative sea-level rise has a wide range of effects on coastal systems.  The immediate \neffect is submergence and increased flooding of coastal land, particularly during extreme \nevents, as well as saltwater intrusion into surface and ground waters.  In the Bay of \nBengal, there have been 23 surge events with over 10,000 people killed in each since \n1737 (Murty et al. 1986; Murty and Flather 1994).  The most severe impacts were felt in \n1737 (300,000 people killed), 1864 (100,000 people killed), 1876 (100,000 people \nkilled), 1897 (175,000 people killed), 1970 (300,000 people killed) and 1991 (about \n140,000 killed and 10 million made homeless).   \n \n 21\nIn Europe the storm surge of 1953 had a major impact with the loss of over 1800 lives in \nthe Netherlands and 300 in southeast England (Wolf and Flather 2005).  This event \nresulted in major programmes of coastal protection in both countries.  The most well-\nknown recent example of coastal flooding is that from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans \nin August 2005.  This can be considered as a combined impact in which unprecedented \nstorm-surge levels were compounded by land subsidence, as occurs naturally in all major \ndeltas, together with anthropogenic changes such as oil withdrawal, modification to the \ndelta wetlands, restriction of river flow, development on flood plains, sea-level rise and \nthe failures of coastal defences.  As of August 2006, estimates are that in excess of 1800 \npeople lost their lives and there was in excess of $125 billion dollars of damage (for \nexample Graumann et al. 2005).  Many of the environmental refugees from Hurricane \nKatrina have not yet returned to New Orleans.   \n \nIncreases in the frequency of extreme sea levels of a given height have been observed in a \nnumber of locations around the world, particularly in the Pacific Ocean and along the east \ncoast of North America (Woodworth and Blackman 2004).  Most of these increases in the \nfrequency of extreme sea levels have occurred as a result of rising mean sea level rather \nthan an increase in the intensity of storm surges.  Data from Australia\u2019s east (Sydney) and \nwest (Fremantle) coasts indicates that high sea levels of a given value are occurring about \nthree times as often in the last half of the 20th century compared with the first half of the \n20th century (Church et al. 2006).  However, to date no study has revealed any significant \nand widespread increase in the intensity of storm surges as would be expected from the \nincreased number of intense hurricanes (Webster et al. 2005; Emanuel 2005).   \n 22\n \nImpacts of sea-level rise are determined by the relative sea-level change, reflecting not \nonly the global-mean trend in sea level, but also regional and local variations in sea-level \nchange and in geological uplift and subsidence.  Areas that are subsiding are more \nthreatened.  The most significant impacts may be associated with the combined impact of \nchanges in interannual variability and extreme sea levels resulting from storms and the \nglobal averaged sea-level rise.  Extreme sea-level scenarios due to changing storm \ncharacteristics need to be considered along with sea-level rise scenarios, although this \ninformation is presently much less developed for most coastal areas.  As noted above, \nmany coastal megacities are built on deltaic regions where significant sinking has \noccurred or is occurring (Nicholls 1995).   \n \nDeltaic regions suffer from a combination of existing anthropogenic problems (e.g. \nsediment entrapment by upstream dams, leading to a lack of fluvial accretion) and sea-\nlevel rise. Ericson et al. (2006) estimate that the \u201ceffective sea-level rise\u201d (i.e. including \nthe effect of subsidence) for 40 deltas worldwide will potentially impact 8,710,000 \npeople by 2050, assuming a global sea-level rise of 2 mm yr-1 (about 2\/3rds of the current \nrate).  This figure includes 3,430,000 people in the Bengal, and 1,910,000 in the Mekong \ndelta. These estimates do not take account of increased exposure to storm surges.   \n \nLonger-term effects also occur.  These include increased coastal erosion (as mentioned \nabove, 70% of the world\u2019s beaches have been eroding over the 20th century and less than \n10% prograding), ecosystem changes, and saltwater intrusion into groundwater.  On \n 23\nsandy coastlines, beach erosion commonly occurs at tens to hundreds of times the rate of \nsea-level rise and will degrade or remove protective coastal features such as sand dunes \nand vegetation, further increasing the risk of coastal flooding.   \n \nOutlook for the Future \n \nProjections of 21st century sea-level rise \n \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides the most authoritative \ninformation on projected sea-level change.  The IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) \nof 2001 (Church et al. 2001) projected a global averaged sea-level rise of between 20 and \n70 cm between 1990 and 2100 using the full range of IPCC greenhouse gas scenarios and \na range of climate models.  When an additional uncertainty for land-ice changes was \nincluded, the full range of projected sea-level rise was 9 to 88 cm.  For the IPCC\u2019s Fourth \nAssessment Report (AR4; Meehl et al. 2007), the range of sea-level projections, using a \nlarger range of models, is 18 to 59 cm (90% confidence limits) over the period from \n1980-1999 to 2090-2099 (Meehl et al. 2007).  The largest contribution is from ocean \nthermal expansion (10-41 cm) with the next largest contribution from glaciers and ice \ncaps (7-17 cm).  Recently, Meier et al. (2007) suggested a larger glacier and ice cap \ncontribution of 10 to 25 cm for the 21st century.  Meier et al.\u2019s projections are based on \nassuming the present contribution remains steady (with no acceleration) or that the \npresent contribution increases, with no allowance for the decreasing area and mass of \nglaciers and ice caps.   \n 24\n \nIn the IPCC AR4 projections, the sum of the ice sheet contributions is small, partly as a \nresult of increased accumulation on the Antarctic Ice Sheet offsetting positive \ncontributions from elsewhere.   \n \nHowever, there is increasing concern about the stability of ice sheets.  For Greenland, this \nconcern is based on measurements indicating an increasing contribution from the ice \nsheet (e.g. Rignot and Kanagaratnam 2006), observations of melt water flowing into \nmoulins and possibly finding its way to the base of the ice sheet, rapid sliding of glaciers \nat the start of the summer melt season (Zwally et al. 2002) and an increase in the \nfrequency of ice quakes (Ekstrom et al. 2006).  Much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is \ngrounded below sea level and the penetration of warmer water beneath the ice shelves to \nthe base of the ice sheet and the subsequent dynamic response is the main reason for \nconcern.  This concern has been reinforced by the acceleration of glaciers on the \nAntarctic Peninsula following the collapse of the Larsen B Ice Shelf (Scambos et al. \n2004; Rignot et al. 2004).  The current suite of ice sheet models do not adequately \nrepresent many of these processes and thus the TAR and AR4 projections of ice sheet \ncontributions to both 21st century and longer term sea-level rise may be underestimated.  \nRecognizing this deficiency, the IPCC AR4 increased the upper limit of the projected \nsea-level rise by 10 to 20 cm above that projected by the models implying a range of \nprojected sea-level rise of 18 cm to 79 cm.  It is unclear what confidence intervals to \nascribe to this range given the ice sheet uncertainties.  In particular, the IPCC AR4 noted \n 25\nthat \u201clarger values cannot be excluded, but understanding of these effects is too limited to \nassess their likelihood or provide a best estimate or an upper bound for sea-level rise.\u201d   \n \nWhile the 2001 and 2007 IPCC projections are somewhat different in how they treat ice \nsheet uncertainties and the confidence limits quoted, a comparison of the projections \n(Figure 6) shows the end results are somewhat similar, except that the lower limit of the \n2001 projections has been raised from 9 cm in the TAR to 18 cm in the AR4.   \n \nDespite the additional allowance for ice sheet uncertainties, a number of scientists remain \nconcerned that the ice-sheet contributions may have been underestimated.  Rahmstorf \n(2007) developed a simple statistical model that related 20th century surface temperature \nchange to 20th century sea-level change.  Using this relationship and projected surface \ntemperature increases, he estimated that 21st century sea-level rise might exceed the IPCC \nprojections and be as much as 1.4 m.  However, Holgate et al. (2007) emphasised that \nRahmstorf\u2019s model is simple and may not adequately represent future change.   \n \nThe concern that the sea-level projections may be biased low has been reinforced by a \ncomparison of observed and projected sea-level rise from 1990 to the present.  For this \nperiod, observed sea level has been rising more rapidly than the central range of the IPCC \n(2001 and 2007) model projections and is at the very upper end of the IPCC TAR \nprojections (Figure 6; Rahmstorf et al. 2007), indicating that one or more of the model \ncontributions to sea-level rise may be underestimated.  \n \n 26\nLonger-term implications \n \nIrrespective of uncertainties in the particular dynamic responses of either or both ice \nsheets, there is no doubt that there is a surface warming value for the Greenland ice \nsheets above which surface melting exceeds precipitation.  This value is estimated to be \nabout 4.5 \u00b1 0.9\u00b0C over Greenland, corresponding to a global averaged warming of about \n3.1 \u00b1 0.8\u00b0C, both compared to pre-industrial values (Gregory and Huybrechts 2006).  For \nsustained warming above this value, there is likely to be an ongoing wastage of the \nGreenland ice sheet, leading to significant rise in global average sea level of up to several \nmetres.  The time scale over which this could occur is disputed.  The processes included \nin the present generation of ice-sheet models lead to time scales of a millennium or two \n(Huybrechts and de Wolde 1999) whereas others (Rignot and Kanagaratnam 2006; \nHansen 2007) have emphasised these fast dynamic responses of the Greenland and West \nAntarctic Ice Sheets implying a sea-level rise of over a metre from ice sheets alone \nduring the 21st century.   \n \nOcean thermal expansion will continue for centuries after greenhouse gas concentration \nare stabilised (Meehl et al. 2005; Wigley 2005) and could eventually be several metres, \ndepending on future greenhouse gas concentrations.  Glacier and ice cap wastage will \nalso continue.  However, melting of glaciers, particularly those at lower altitude and \nlatitude, will eventually result in significant reduction of the sizes of the glaciers and \nreductions in their contribution to the rate of sea-level rise.  The long-term contribution to \nsea level from glaciers and ice caps is limited to less than about 37 cm, the upper limit of \n 27\ncurrent estimates of glacier and ice cap volume.  Note however that there are significant \nimplications for local water supply from long term melting of glaciers and ice caps for a \nnumber of regions, notably those downstream of the Himalayas and the tropical Andes.   \n \nConclusions \n \nGeological data indicate that there was an increase in the rate of sea-level rise in the late \n19th and\/or early 20th century and that sea level rose during the 20th century at a much \nfaster rate than the last few centuries and millennia (Figure 7).  In situ and satellite data \nindicate an increase in the rate of rise since 1870 and that sea level is currently rising at a \nfaster rate than at any time during the last 130 years.  Sea level is projected to continue to \nrise at an increasing rate during the 21st century.  Even if we stabilise atmospheric \nconcentrations at today\u2019s (or some other) level, some further increase in sea-level rise \nwill still occur (Meehl et al. 2005; Wigley 2005; Wigley 1995).   \n \nThe 20th and particularly the 21st centuries\u2019 sea levels are significantly higher than that \nexperienced over recent centuries (Figure 7) and millennia (Figure 1).  Significant further \nwork is required to understand adequately 20th century sea-level rise and thus improve \nprojections for the future; a fundamental aspect of that work is the need to sustain and \nenhance a suite of ongoing satellite and in situ observing systems.   \n \nFor the period 1961 to 2003, the sea-level budget is not closed \u2013 sea level was rising at \n1.8 mm yr-1, faster than estimated from knowledge of the contributions at about 1.1 mm \n 28\nyr-1 (Bindoff et al. 2007).  For 1993-2003, Bindoff et al. report that the sum of the \ncontributions was approximately equal to the observed rise.  However, it is now known \nthat the thermal expansion was over-estimated for this period.  Closing the sea-level \nbudget is an area of active research.  Over the last several decades, including the period \nof the IPCC projections since 1990, models indicate a slower rate of sea-level rise than \nobserved, thus raising concern about the adequacy of projections for the 21st century.  \nThis observation and the uncertainty about ice-sheet stability, for example as raised by \nHansen (2007), further raises concern about the magnitude and the impacts of future sea-\nlevel rise.   \n \nThere are significant regional variations in the rate of sea-level rise, some of which are \nassociated with interannual climate variability.  However, there are also emerging spatial \npatterns which may be part of a long-term trend.  The current generation of climate \nmodels does not yet provide robust projections of regional patterns of sea-level rise.  As a \nresult, the global averaged sea-level rise should be considered for planning purposes, with \nsome allowance for a potentially larger contribution as a result of the regional pattern of \nsea-level rise.   \n \nThe impacts of sea-level rise are being felt now, they will be felt during the 21st century \nand in the longer term and society will need to adapt to the effects of these rising sea \nlevels.  These effects include coastal inundation and its consequences, and increased rates \nof coastal erosion.  Impacts will be felt most acutely during extreme events.  Coastal \nflooding events will become more severe and events of a given height will occur more \n 29\nfrequently; indeed analysis to date indicates there has already been an increase in \nfrequency of these flooding events.  The least developed countries and the poor are most \nat risk.  Environmental refugees already exist as a result of extreme sea-level events and \nthere will only be an increase in their numbers as a result of sea-level rise during the 21st \ncentury and beyond.  Adaptation requires local and regional planning to avoid the \nimpacts of the most severe events. \n \nThere is a need to urgently reduce emissions of greenhouse gases if we are to avoid the \nmost extreme sea-level rise scenarios.  A major question is whether we will pass a critical \npoint during the 21st century that will lead to an ongoing and possibly irretrievable \nmelting of the Greenland or West Antarctic ice sheet and a sea-level rise of several \nmetres.  Our current understanding of ice-sheet dynamics is insufficient to predict \nwhether any such large rise would occur in a few centuries or would occur over many \ncenturies to millennia.   \n \nTo address sea-level rise and its impacts requires partnerships between science, \ngovernment, business and community sectors.  These partnerships are required now and \nwill need to be strengthened during the 21st century.  Appropriate strategies can lead to a \nsignificant amelioration of the impacts of sea-level rise through both mitigation of our \nemissions and also plans to adapt to the inevitable consequences of sea-level rise. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThis paper is a contribution to the CSIRO Climate Change Research Program and the \nCSIRO Wealth from Oceans Flagship and was supported by the Australian Government\u2019s \nCooperative Research Centres Programme through the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems \n 30\nCooperative Research Centre.
