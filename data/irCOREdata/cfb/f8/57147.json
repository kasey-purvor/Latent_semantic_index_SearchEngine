Here we review the successes and problems 35 \nencountered with implementation of the WFD over the past 10 years and provide 36 \nrecommendations to further improve the implementation process. We particularly address 37 \nthree fields: (i) the development of assessment methods (including reference conditions, 38 \ntypologies and intercalibration); (ii) the implementation of assessment systems in monitoring 39 \nprogrammes; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the design, 40 \nmonitoring and success of restoration measures). 41 \nThe development of assessment methods has been a transparent process and has resulted in 42 \nimproved and more standardised tools for assessing water bodies across Europe. The process 43 \nhas been more time consuming, and methods are more complex, than originally expected. 44 \nFuture challenges still remain, including the estimation of uncertainty of assessment results 45 \nand a revision of rules in combining the results obtained with different Biological Quality 46 \nElements. 47 \nA huge amount of monitoring data is now being generated for WFD purposes. Monitoring 48 \ndata are not centrally stored and thus poorly accessible for purposes beyond the WFD. Future 49 \nchallenges include enhanced data accessibility and the establishment of a Europe-wide central 50 \nmonitoring network of reference sites. 51 \nThe WFD River Basin Management Plans base management decisions on the response of 52 \naquatic organisms to environmental stress. In contrast to the effects of degradation, the biotic 53 \nresponse to restoration is less well known and poorly predictable. The timescale of the WFD 54 \n(obtaining good ecological status in all surface waters by 2027) is over-ambitious. Future 55 \nchallenges include long-term monitoring of restoration measures to understand the 56 \n 4 \nrequirements for ecosystems to recover and prioritisation of measures according to re-57 \ncolonisation potential. 58 \n 59 \nKeywords: assessment, typology, uncertainty, monitoring, Heavily Modified Water Bodies, 60 \nRiver Basin Management Plans, restoration, recovery 61 \n 62 \n63 \n 5 \nIntroduction 64 \nThe 1990s saw an emergence worldwide of holistic environmental management, integrated 65 \npollution control and countries embracing the ecosystem approach which combines natural 66 \nand social sciences in tackling environmental problems (Apitz et al., 2006). This was most 67 \nembodied in the Earth Summits in 1992 (Rio de Janeiro), 1995 (New York) and 2002 68 \n(Johannesburg) and the 1992 Convention of Biological Diversity. In these meetings, countries 69 \nworldwide agreed to achieve environmental sustainability. Within Europe, this led to the 70 \nproposal for a EU Directive on the Ecological Quality of Surface Waters which followed on 71 \nfrom many countries adopting monitoring schemes and environmental quality objectives and 72 \nstandards. Since the 1970s, parts of Europe (e.g. UK and Sweden) had already shown a 73 \nwillingness to harmonise environmental measures to tackle trans-regional water quality issues 74 \n(McLusky and Elliott, 2004). Following this, the regional seas agreements for the North-East 75 \nAtlantic (the OSPAR Commission), the Baltic (the HELCOM commission) and the 76 \nMediterranean (the Barcelona Convention) were convened to achieve coordinated 77 \nmanagement of source catchments and receiving marine areas. 78 \nThe European Directive proposal for the Ecological Quality of Surface Waters was never 79 \nadopted, possibly because of its high ecological bias and inadequate consideration of socio- 80 \neconomic impacts. But this embryo of an idea eventually resulted in the drafting of the 81 \nEuropean Water Framework Directive which was finally adopted in 2000. The WFD had a 82 \nprecedent in the US Clean Water Act (CWA), published in 1972 and amended in 1977 and 83 \nduring the 1980s. There are clear parallels between the WFD and the CWA, in terms of 84 \nobjectives, implementation and ecological approaches. In both statutes, the status of water is 85 \nimportant for a variety of uses and users, including bathing, outdoor recreation, industry and 86 \ndrinking (Hoornbeek, 2004). The policies arose from concerns about water status, where 87 \nstrong economic interests were often set against the diffuse interest of the general public. 88 \nPolicy solutions in this area generally included setting water quality standards, implementing 89 \n 6 \ndischarge controls and minimizing the impacts of anthropogenic pressures on surface water 90 \nquality (Hoornbeek, 2004). 91 \nThe implementation of the WFD has been, and still is, a major challenge. Almost all EU 92 \nMember States have spent considerable time and resources to develop tools, to gain the 93 \nrequired data and to prepare River Basin Management Plans. In this context both the EU and 94 \nits Member States have funded a large number of research projects, particularly in the areas of 95 \necological assessment and catchment modelling. 96 \nThe WFD has impacted various levels of environmental management of aquatic resources and 97 \nhas triggered the re-organization of water management by hydrological catchments, rather 98 \nthan by administrative borders, with the ultimate goal to improve the quality of surface water 99 \nbodies. It has also been an important incentive towards harmonisation of classification and 100 \nmonitoring methods across Europe. The biotic communities of European surface waters are 101 \nnow the primary focus, used to assess the status of lakes, rivers and marine ecosystems and 102 \nthe success of management. The WFD has precipitated a fundamental change in management 103 \nobjectives from merely pollution control to ensuring ecosystem integrity as a whole. 104 \nDeterioration and improvement of \u201eecological quality\u201f is defined by the response of the biota, 105 \nrather than by changes in physical or chemical variables.  106 \nFrom a scientific perspective, the implementation of the WFD is greatly increasing 107 \nknowledge on the ecology of European surface waters, particularly in regions which have 108 \nrarely been investigated: approximately 1,900 papers have resulted from research projects 109 \nassociated with the implementation of the directive (query \u201eWater Framework Directive\u201f in 110 \nSCOPUS at 4\/12\/2009). Many methods to sample and investigate aquatic ecosystems have 111 \nbeen developed and large amounts of data are being generated.  112 \nThe underlying concept of the WFD and, in particular, the way it has been implemented in 113 \npractice has received major criticism, from politicians, water managers and scientists (e.g. 114 \nMoss, 2007, 2008; Dufour and Piegay, 2009). Here, we review experiences with the WFD 115 \n 7 \nimplementation from the perspective of natural scientists involved in research projects and 116 \nintercalibration working groups supporting the implementation process. We aim to provide a 117 \nbalanced review of both the successes and the problems encountered with implementation 118 \nover the past 10 years and give recommendations on how to further improve the 119 \nimplementation process for the future. We particularly address three fields: (i) the 120 \ndevelopment of assessment methods (including reference conditions, typologies and 121 \nintercalibration); (ii) the design of monitoring programmes and how they are related to the 122 \nassessment systems; and (iii) the consequences for river basin management plans (such as the 123 \nimplementation and success of restoration \/ rehabilitation measures).  124 \n 125 \nAssessment of Ecological Status 126 \nThe WFD was welcomed by many for its innovativeness and radical shift to measure quality 127 \nof all surface waters using a range of biological communities rather than the more limited 128 \naspects of chemical quality (Moss, 2007). This was recognised as being a much more 129 \neffective integrative way to measure ecological quality. This innovativeness did, however, 130 \ncome with a number of substantial challenges for ecologists in requiring complex and 131 \ndynamic biological communities to be quantified into a single numeric score, rather than 132 \nqualitative species lists, for reference conditions to be established from which to measure the 133 \ndegree of change, and for this all to be carried out within a large number of water body types. 134 \nThe uncertainty in the resulting quality classification and reference conditions also had to be 135 \nquantified in a robust way. One major obstacle was the fact that no consistent biological 136 \ndatasets were generally available for lakes, rivers and coastal waters. A major achievement of 137 \nthe WFD is that many sampling and analysis procedures have been standardised across 138 \nEurope (e.g. CEN, 2004), there has been investment in taxonomic training, and extensive 139 \nmonitoring programmes including physical, chemical and biological variables have been 140 \n 8 \nimplemented. An overview of major implementation successes, problems and solutions is 141 \ngiven in Table 1, while below we provide details on individual successes and obstacles. 142 \n 143 \nAssessment systems: are we lost in complexity? 144 \nThe requirements of the WFD concerning ecological assessment of aquatic ecosystems are 145 \nboth specific and general at the same time. Annexes II and V of the Directive contain many 146 \ndetails, e.g. criteria for water body typologies and a range of specific components of five 147 \nBiological Quality Elements (BQEs) and associated hydromorphological and physico-148 \nchemical elements to be monitored. While the WFD indicates what characteristics of the 149 \nBQEs should be assessed (e.g. \u201eabundance\u201f, \u201ecommunity composition\u201f) it does not specify 150 \nwhich indices or metrics of these various elements should be used. The specification of 151 \nmetrics and indices for the different BQEs has been left to scientists in member states to 152 \npropose, and this in turn has resulted in the age-old problem that those carrying out the 153 \nmonitoring are often unwilling to change from their usual practices. Most assessment systems 154 \nexisting in the year 2000 in the EU Member States were, however, not compliant with the 155 \nWFD, as they were generally not reference-based (i.e assessed deviation from an acceptable 156 \nbaseline) or specific to water types. 157 \nEfforts to develop new methods fulfilling the complex requirements of the WFD were huge, 158 \nand as the process was not organised centrally many national and international projects 159 \ncontributed (examples for lakes: Moss et al., 2003; Lyche-Solheim et al., 2008; rivers: Hering 160 \net al., 2004; Furse et al. 2006; Schmutz et al. 2007; coastal and transitional waters: Borja, 161 \n2005; Borja et al., 2004, 2007). No generally applicable European method for water body 162 \nassessment resulted and methods developed differed between countries, between Biological 163 \nQuality Elements and between water categories and types. Major differences existed in 164 \ntaxonomic resolution (species vs. higher taxonomic levels), the way of defining reference 165 \n 9 \nconditions, type vs. site specific assessment and the number and nature of indices (metrics) 166 \nused. 167 \nA recent review of 252 WFD-compliant assessment systems published on 168 \nwww.wiser.eu\/results\/methods-db revealed that a large proportion (46%) of these systems 169 \ntarget various forms of water pollution (acidification, eutrophication, heavy metals, pollution 170 \nby organic compounds, pollution by organic matter). Other frequently addressed stress types 171 \nare general degradation (19%), hydromorphological degradation (10%), habitat destruction 172 \n(8%), riparian habitat alteration (5%), catchment land use (4%), flow modification (4%) and 173 \nimpact of alien species (4%), resulting in a higher diversity of stressors being assessed. 174 \nParticularly for rivers, assessment metrics have often been selected based on their correlation 175 \nto hydrological, morphological or land use parameters (e.g. Hering et al. 2004, Schmutz et al. 176 \n2007). In some cases assessment systems have been developed irrespective of stressors, 177 \ncomparing the present situation to historic data or least disturbed systems (e.g. Blomquist et 178 \nal. 2007, Perus et al. 2007, Muxika et al. 2007). 179 \n Effects of different field and lab procedures, in many cases, are relatively minor (Furse et al., 180 \n2006, Borja et al., 2007) and in one case a common Europe-wide method has been developed 181 \n(fish in rivers, Pont et al., 2006, 2007). 182 \nThe unavoidable discrepancies in methodologies had to be managed by additional tools such 183 \nas the intercalibration process. The developed assessment methods have often been criticised 184 \nfor being too complex, while much more simple parameters (such as water transparency) may 185 \ngive a sufficiently precise idea of the ecological status (Moss et al., 2003; Peeters et al., 186 \n2009). Yet this criticism does not offer alternatives that are compliant with the WFD 187 \nlegislation. Peeters et al. (2009) provided convincing arguments that transparency suffices for 188 \ndetermining the eutrophication status of lakes, although they only illustrate their case on a 189 \nrestricted set of water-bodies \u2013 very shallow, lowland lakes. No evidence is given that the 190 \napproach is applicable to other lake types or lakes where eutrophication may not be the key 191 \n 10 \npressure. The strength of the WFD approach (monitoring a range of biotic communities) is 192 \nthat it potentially addresses complex mixtures of stressors in very different regions and water-193 \nbody types. 194 \nAdvocates for simplicity in the assessment systems also argue that the breadth of current 195 \napproaches developed do not encapsulate the concept of a healthy functioning ecosystem. The 196 \nrequirements of the WFD assessment schemes outlined in Annex II and V predominantly 197 \nrelate to structural elements rather than functional ones. Consequently, many of the new 198 \nmetrics developed focus on taxonomic indices, rather than ecosystem function (e.g. de Jonge 199 \net al., 2006). Although it could be argued that taxonomic metrics are fundamentally an 200 \nexpression of function, future research could explore further how structural elements could be 201 \nused more explicitly to represent system functioning (e.g. macrophyte growing depth as an 202 \nindicator of benthic vs. planktonic production, ratios of invertebrate functional feeding 203 \ngroups). Moss (2008) argues that key features such as nutrient parsimony, connectivity and 204 \nresilience to change should be included. There are certainly different ways of assessing 205 \necosystem health but as the annexes of the WFD are explicit concerning biotic data to be 206 \nincluded into assessment systems taxonomic indices of adequate confidence and precision can 207 \nnot be avoided, irrespective of the potential worth of alternative approaches.  208 \nA major achievement of the WFD has been the development process itself. In all Member 209 \nStates experts working on different organism groups and ecosystem types considered \u201ethe best 210 \napproach\u201f for monitoring and developing ecological classifications. The large number and 211 \nvariety of people involved in the development of assessment systems for the WFD can be 212 \nseen in a recently generated overview of European assessment methodologies on 213 \nwww.wiser.eu\/results\/methods-db.  214 \nIt is hard to argue against the fact that biomonitoring methods and data quality have improved 215 \noverall. The fact that different assessment systems evolved across Europe reflects the 216 \ndiversity of water body types and pressures: in some countries and ecosystem types single 217 \n 11 \nstressors which are easy to assess predominate (e.g. organic pollution or eutrophication), 218 \nwhile in other cases a complex mixture of stressors affect water bodies (e.g. nutrient 219 \nenrichment, hydromorphological degradation, toxic substances, overfishing). Ecological 220 \nknowledge of different organism groups varies across Europe. In Northern Europe most 221 \naquatic species and their ecological preferences are known, while the aquatic stages of many 222 \nspecies occurring in Southern European waters are still not described (Schmidt-Kloiber et al., 223 \n2006).  224 \nIn conclusion, technical implementation of the WFD Annexes is a complex process, but the 225 \nuse of several quality elements and establishment of typologies and reference conditions is a 226 \nmajor improvement.  The resultant schemes are probably more complicated than what the 227 \nauthors of the WFD intended. The effort required for developing assessment methods was, 228 \nhowever, grossly underestimated and, therefore, assessment methods were often not available 229 \nbefore River Basin Management Plans had to be drafted in 2008-2009. On the other hand, the 230 \ndevelopment process and the resulting methods have led to a new understanding of applied 231 \naquatic ecology in Europe; knowledge that is now not restricted to a small group of 232 \nresearchers. Indeed, technicians, water managers and, to some degree, stakeholders and 233 \npoliticians, have contributed to the process and learned to communicate despite educational 234 \nand cultural differences. So, maybe the greatest value emerged from the process itself.  235 \n 236 \nUncertainty in assessment 237 \nA central element in WFD-compliant assessment systems is the estimation of uncertainty. 238 \nThis builds on the understanding that there is no definitive means in bioassessment and that 239 \nall results are influenced by several sources of variability and errors, for example variability in 240 \nsampling and laboratory analysis, seasonal and geographical variability (Clarke and Hering, 241 \n2006; Carstensen, 2007). For this reason, ecological status classification results should always 242 \nbe given in terms of probabilities. Today only a small proportion of assessment systems have 243 \n 12 \nput this into practice. Including uncertainty estimation into assessment schemes is a major 244 \nchallenge of the next phase of WFD implementation. The underlying statistical principles are 245 \nrelatively simple and appropriate tools for uncertainty estimation are available (e.g. Clarke 246 \nand Hering, 2006; Carstensen, 2007) but data are needed which address the individual sources 247 \nof error, such as differences between investigators and sampling equipment\/analysis, as well 248 \nas temporal (diurnal, weather event-related, seasonal) and spatial (representative sampling 249 \nlocation) variation of sampling, affecting the distribution of the assessment results. These 250 \nprinciples apply to all assessment systems, even to methods, which are very simple to apply 251 \nsuch as those suggested by Moss (2008). For example, the WFD has been a major driver in 252 \nimproving our understanding of the effect of sampling frequency and location on annual 253 \nestimates of total phosphorus and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Carvalho et al., 2006; 2007).  254 \nGiven quantitative information of these sources of uncertainty, the likelihood of different 255 \nstatus classifications can be computed. More challenging, however, is to convey the concept 256 \nand principles of uncertainty to water managers: that it is more appropriate to know the 257 \namount of error affecting an assessment method than to give results with an unknown or 258 \nunrealistic precision. If the major sources of error are known, they can potentially be 259 \nminimised through the re-design of sampling schemes (additional sampling sites or 260 \nfrequency), through improved training by operating procedures, CEN (European Committee 261 \nfor Standardization) guidance, taxonomic training or through the use of model-based 262 \nassessment methods (Pont et al., 2009). Though there is no central overview available, 263 \ntaxonomic training has been implemented in several countries in connection with the WFD: 264 \nIn Germany, the German Limnological Association has offered 35 training courses on 265 \ndifferent organism groups (http:\/\/www.dgl-ev.de\/arbeitskreise\/ak.taxonomie.html), additional 266 \ncourses in Germany have been offered by the Senckenberg Institute. In Austria training 267 \ncourses cover all BQEs (http:\/\/wasser.lebensministerium.at\/article\/archive\/5659). In Finland, 268 \ntraining on phytoplankton taxonomy has been carried out by the Finnish Environment 269 \n 13 \nInstitute in collaboration with the Finnish Phytoplankton Society. Also regular 270 \nintercalibrations of phytoplankton analysis have been conducted. The Quality Assurance of 271 \nthe phytoplankton counting has been ensured by reference laboratory activities as described 272 \nby Lepist\u00f6 et al. (2009). Marine biologists have agreed on common taxonomical standards 273 \n(http:\/\/www.marbef.org\/data\/erms.php) which is now the basis for identification by most labs. 274 \nInherent in the discussions of uncertainty is the realisation that scientists will have their 275 \nmethods and approaches subjected to legal and political scrutiny. The determination of 276 \necological status, and thus the need to invest large amounts of money to remediate problems, 277 \nis influenced by the uncertainty in defining status, especially when metric results are close to 278 \nthe good\/moderate class boundary. Thus any Member State that is taken to the European 279 \nCourt through infringement procedures related to doubtful assessment methods would have to 280 \ndemonstrate the robustness of its methods. Furthermore, there is concern about the capacity 281 \nwithin monitoring agencies across Europe to design and implement monitoring programmes 282 \nwith sufficient sampling to provide a proper basis for uncertainty estimation. This concern is 283 \nre-enforced by the change of many national Environmental Protection Agencies over the past 284 \ndecades from executive bodies of aquatic monitoring to merely administrative bodies with 285 \nquite a remote sense of the need for scientific rigor in the ecological status assessments.  286 \n 287 \nTypology: is it needed? 288 \nAccording to the WFD, ecological assessment has to be \u201etype specific\u201f, i.e. water bodies 289 \nshould be grouped according to their physical and morphological attributes, such as salinity, 290 \nalkalinity, catchment size or altitude\/depth. With the experiences gained during the WFD 291 \nimplementation process it is clear that the use of water body types is a simple and appropriate 292 \ntool for water managers and the general public to better understand the natural differences in 293 \naquatic communities and consequently differences in restoration targets. On the other hand, 294 \ntypologies are coarse delimitations of naturally continuous gradients across a wide range of 295 \n 14 \necosystem characteristics. In reality many environmental parameters influence community 296 \ncomposition, even when human-induced stress is not considered (Sandin and Verdonschot, 297 \n2006; Aroviita et al., 2009). The WFD allows any natural environmental parameter 298 \ninfluencing communities to be included in the typology system (System B, Annex II), but 299 \nthere is always a trade-off between having all environmental factors included and having a 300 \nmanageable typology system. There is no compilation of the typologies used by the European 301 \nmember states available but most likely the individual typologies are not comparable at all.   302 \nOne way forward is a relatively simple approach consisting of broadly defined types (e.g. 303 \nMoss et al., 2003 for lakes), which coarsely discriminate \u201ecommon types\u201f to be used in the 304 \nintercalibration process. Such types have been defined for lakes, rivers and coastal waters, but 305 \nstill need to be determined for transitional waters (Borja et al., 2009a). The alternative is a 306 \nsophisticated typology reflecting relatively minor natural ecological gradients and thus fine-307 \nscale differences in community structure as described by Verdonschot (1995) for rivers in the 308 \nNetherlands, Lorenz et al. (2004) for rivers in Germany and Hull et al. (2004) for coastal and 309 \ntransitional waters in the UK. Site-specific assessment (prediction systems) might be the ideal 310 \nsolution, as this approach incorporates the individual characteristics of a site, rather than 311 \nadopting a standard set of descriptors partitioning natural variability. Recent studies suggest 312 \nthat site-specific assessments have higher sensitivity, particularly for water bodies close to 313 \ntypology boundaries and in the absence of undisturbed sites for a water body type (Clarke et 314 \nal., 2003; Pont et al. 2006; Cardoso et al., 2007; Aroviita et al., 2009; Carvalho et al., 2009).  315 \nIn conclusion, it is emphasised that parameters relevant for typology are among the major 316 \nsources of uncertainty in ecological assessment. The more specific assessment systems are 317 \nbetter if they have been corrected for typological differences.  While for the coarse evaluation 318 \nof ecological status, and communication of results to managers and the public, broadly 319 \ndefined types might be sufficient, the logical endpoint for a sophisticated assessment method 320 \nwill be site-specific prediction systems, although not strictly WFD-compliant.  321 \n 15 \n 322 \nIntercalibration: Comparing the incomparable? 323 \nThe authors of the WFD had in mind a simple assessment system. Likely they had the vision 324 \nof just a few assessment metrics to be applied across Europe \u2013 this proved not to be realistic 325 \nnor achievable: stressors affecting aquatic ecosystems differ between regions, and the effects 326 \nof different stressors (e.g. acidification and eutrophication) could not be assessed with the 327 \nsame metrics. Water body types not only differ in terms of size and catchment geology, but 328 \nalso in their species pools and the bioindicator taxa present. Unavoidably, sampling methods 329 \nalso differ between types, e.g. small and large rivers. Between regions, knowledge on the taxa 330 \noccurring differs greatly (Schmidt-Kloiber et al., 2006). Therefore, uniform taxonomically-331 \nbased assessment methods could not account for all these differences to be applicable 332 \nthroughout Europe. Alternatively, ecological assessment could have been based on simple 333 \nparameters, such as water transparency and catchment land use (Moss et al., 2003; Peeters et 334 \nal., 2009).  335 \nOne of the most important obstacles for implementing a harmonised assessment is that 336 \nbiomonitoring traditions differ between countries (especially for invertebrates). Countries 337 \nhaving well established biomonitoring systems were resistant to change, in particular those 338 \ncountries having long time series. These differences have led to several methods reflecting 339 \nboth a variety of European water bodies and biomonitoring history. The logical consequence 340 \nwas that methods used for the WFD have to be intercalibrated, a comparison process which 341 \nwas already planned for in the WFD (Annex V, section 1.4.1).  342 \nThe first intercalibration was a pilot exercise with an unknown outcome and had to compare 343 \nmany methods, many of which had not been fully developed (Heiskanen et al., 2004), 344 \nalthough some experience in comparing a limited number of assessment methods using 345 \ncorrelation methods existed (e.g. Ghetti and Bonazzi, 1977; Friedrich et al., 1995; Stubauer 346 \nand Moog, 2000; Krause-Jensen et al., 2009). The WFD intercalibration approach was 347 \n 16 \noriginally thought to be based on comparison of member states\u201f assessment methods on a 348 \nsmall number of sites; however for statistical reasons this was not useful. Therefore, other 349 \noptions were developed (Common Implementation Strategy, 2005), in which the compilation 350 \nof a dataset of sites covering the whole pressure gradient was recommended. One of these 351 \noptions (\u201eOption 2\u201f) is based on \u201ecommon metrics\u201f, against which national methods are 352 \ncompared. 353 \nFor some BQEs and water categories, such as benthic invertebrates in coastal waters (Borja et 354 \nal., 2007, 2009a) and phytoplankton biomass in lakes (as chlorophyll a) (Poikane, 2009), the 355 \nintercalibration results were surprisingly clear: most of the assessment systems give the same 356 \npattern. For other BQEs, such as phytoplankton composition in lakes, the first intercalibration 357 \nresults differed so much for certain regions (Central-Baltic GIG) that the results were rejected 358 \nby the Commission from the Intercalibration Official Decision. This was largely a result of 359 \nthe diverse array of metrics produced across Member States.  For some BQEs, such as fish, 360 \nand one water category (transitional waters) the assessment systems had not been sufficiently 361 \ndeveloped to allow any intercalibration results in the first phase (2004-2008).  362 \nThe first phase of the intercalibration exercise has been subject to two separate scientific 363 \nreviews on coastal \/ transitional waters and on lakes \/ rivers, which generally agreed with the 364 \nfinally selected approaches, e.g. the use of common metrics and the use of bands of 365 \nacceptable boundary values. However, several critical points were raised, in particular it needs 366 \nto be ensured that reference conditions are set in a harmonized way, intercalibration is done 367 \nseparately for different stressors, and inter-annual variability needs to be taken into account. 368 \nDue to these shortcomings the EC extended the intercalibration process with a second phase 369 \n(2009-2012) to allow completion of intercalibration for all BQEs in all water categories. A 370 \nnew intercalibration guidance and new annexes have been drafted, addressing more 371 \nharmonised procedures to set reference conditions and class boundaries and to compare the 372 \noutcome of individual intercalibration exercises.  373 \n 17 \nFor this second phase of the intercalibration exercise three main problems remain: (i) there is 374 \nstill a significant delay in the process, which is due to the slow development of assessment 375 \nsystems in many countries; (ii) the number of individual intercalibration exercises is very high 376 \n(number of GIGs * number of BQEs * number of water categories leading to > 100 377 \nexercises); and (iii) dissemination of intercalibration results is difficult. Although the 378 \nintercalibration methods used are basically simple the process itself has been composed of 379 \nseveral steps and is relatively complex. Combined, these problems have often led to the fear 380 \namong water managers that intercalibration will have significant impact on already finalised 381 \nsteps of WFD implementation used as a basis for the first River Basin Management Plans, e.g. 382 \non the identification of which water bodies actually need to be restored and the associated 383 \nplanning and reporting requirements.  384 \n 385 \nMerging assessment results: The funnel effect 386 \nSummarizing all sources of variability into an ecological assessment of a water body results in 387 \ntwo types of errors: type I errors (detecting a difference when no real difference exists) and 388 \ntype II errors (not detecting a difference which is real). As type I error increases when type II 389 \nerror is reduced and vice versa, provided the number of observations remains unchanged, both 390 \nof these errors cannot be eliminated unless the entire population is sampled. They are best 391 \nmanaged by giving probabilities, i.e. the likelihood of a site to fall into a status class (Clarke 392 \net al., 2003).  393 \nOne of the challenges of the WFD results from the combination rules stipulated. In general, 394 \ndifferent organism groups are sampled per water body and assessed independently. The 395 \nlowest score of all assessment results determines the overall ecological quality class (i.e. the 396 \nassessment defaults to the lowest category, the \u201eone-out, all-out\u201f principle; see WFD Annex 397 \nV, section 1.4.2 (i) and WG ECOSTAT 2003).  398 \n 18 \nThis procedure is prone to reduce type II errors (i.e. reducing the likelihood that a water body 399 \nis classified as good status, when in reality it is below good status). The \u201eone-out, all-out\u201f 400 \nprinciple is thus in line with the precautionary principle, and will provide sufficient protection 401 \nfor the most vulnerable BQE to the most dominant pressures. At the same time this principle 402 \nwill also tend to inflate type I errors (concluding that a water body is below good status, even 403 \nif the water body in reality has good status), thus posing a risk of implementing measures 404 \nwhere they are not strictly needed. For instance, if three BQEs in a good-status water body are 405 \nsampled and one of these results is affected by a type I error (e.g. wrongly classified as 406 \nmoderate status), the final result (moderate status) will be determined by the error \u2013 407 \nirrespective of the fact that the two other results are correct (good status). As a result, the 408 \n\u201eone-out, all-out\u201f principle increases the likelihood of deriving a lower status class by sheer 409 \nrandomness, whereas the risk of misclassifying to a higher status than the actual state 410 \nbecomes less likely (Sandin, 2005). An example from Germany is given in Table 2, showing 411 \nthat a much larger proportion of sites fail the good status objective when the one-out-all-out 412 \nrule is used compared with when only one BQE is used. 413 \nThe \u201eone-out, all-out\u201f principle has been criticised by several authors (Borja and Heinrich, 414 \n2005; Sandin, 2005; Sondergaard et al., 2005; Borja et al., 2009c; Tueros et al., 2009) for 415 \nthese statistical reasons. Furthermore, it contrasts with the ecosystem approach the WFD is 416 \npursuing, as it is scientifically difficult to justify that a single component determines the 417 \nquality of an ecosystem. As the legislation is clear in terms of the \u201eone-out, all-out\u201f principle 418 \nthere is no simple way to avoid this problem. Options to reduce type I errors include: (i) the 419 \nchoice of confidence levels for the different BQEs in a way to minimise the risk of type I 420 \nerrors (Carstensen, 2007); (ii) increase of sampling frequency or density to reduce the 421 \nvariation in each BQE; (iii) omitting BQEs with too high variability from the assessment (the 422 \nlatter is also recommended by the WFD). Future amendments of the WFD may consider 423 \n 19 \nalternative combination rules (see Borja et al., 2004, 2008a, 2009b) and should require 424 \nestimates for the degree of type I and type II errors.  425 \n 426 \nAssessment of heavily modified water bodies (HMWB) 427 \nThe WFD requires Member States to distinguish between \u201enatural\u201f and \u201eheavily modified 428 \nwater bodies\u201f (HMWBs). The latter are designated as having an acceptably lower ecological 429 \nstatus as the result of hydromorphological pressures, which cannot be removed because of the 430 \nhigh social or economic cost. Because of this, the quality targets for HMWBs are \u201egood 431 \nchemical status\u201f (compliant to natural water bodies) and \u201egood ecological potential\u201f, 432 \npragmatically defined as the ecological quality expected under the conditions of the 433 \nimplementation of all possible measures (see Borja and Elliott, 2007). This may result in 434 \nsignificantly reduced ecological quality targets. The designation process of HMWBs is 435 \ncomposed of several steps and involves a certain level of complexity (Common 436 \nImplementation Strategy for the Water Framework Directive, 2002). Nevertheless, a 437 \nsignificant proportion of European water bodies has been designated as HMWB due to 438 \nhydromorphological degradation; in four member states (Netherlands, Belgium, Slovak 439 \nRepublic, Czech Republic) more than 50% of the water bodies were designated as HMWB. 440 \nWith the exception of these first four, member states have on average provisionally identified 441 \naround 16% of their water bodies as heavily modified and artificial (Commission of the 442 \nEuropean Communities, 2007). 443 \nTwo different approaches towards ecological assessment exist for HMWBs: the Prague 444 \napproach (Kampa and Kranz, 2005) which is mainly based on measures and the Common 445 \nImplementation Strategy guidance approach more strongly involving biological assessment 446 \n(CIS Working Group 2.2 on Heavily Modified Water Bodies, 2003). As HMWBs are not 447 \nexceptional cases the comparability with assessment results to those obtained for natural 448 \nwater bodies should be guaranteed. From our point of view, the assessment of HMWBs 449 \n 20 \nshould therefore be based on the same metrics as for natural water bodies. The quality targets 450 \nshould be adapted on a case-by-case basis, in some cases removing those BQEs which are 451 \ndirectly affected by hydromorphological pressures (e.g. macroalgae and angiosperms in 452 \ntransitional waters modified as harbours, which lack suitable habitats after massive dredging), 453 \nwhile keeping those that are most sensitive to the other pressures acting on the HMWBs.  454 \n 455 \nMonitoring systems 456 \nThe assessment systems discussed above are the principal tools for monitoring ecological 457 \nstatus under the WFD, which have now been implemented in all EU member states. The 458 \nWFD distinguishes among three types of monitoring (see Borja et al., 2008b): (i) surveillance 459 \nmonitoring, to assess long-term changes resulting from widespread anthropogenic activity; 460 \n(ii) operational monitoring, in order to establish the status of those water bodies identified as 461 \nbeing at risk of failing to meet their environmental objectives; and assess any changes in the 462 \nstatus of such water bodies resulting from the programmes of measures; and (iii) investigative 463 \nmonitoring, carried out where the reason of any exceedance for ecological and chemical status 464 \nis unknown; where surveillance monitoring indicates that the objectives for a water body are 465 \nnot likely to be achieved (and determine the causes); or to ascertain the magnitude and 466 \nimpacts of \u201eaccidental\u201f pollution.  467 \nThe implementation of the monitoring programmes is a great achievement, as for the first 468 \ntime comparable pan-European data sets to assess ecological status of surface waters are 469 \nbeing obtained as a fundamental basis for restoration of impacted aquatic ecosystems 470 \n(Ferreira et al., 2007). In addition to the development of assessment systems, the 471 \nestablishment of harmonised monitoring programmes is still a challenge, since the design of 472 \nmonitoring programmes reported to the Commission is highly variable in terms of station 473 \ndensity, sampling frequency and choice of BQEs. From our point of view the following issues 474 \nshould be regarded to further strengthen the programmes.  475 \n 21 \n 476 \nThe data: Big deal or big mess? 477 \nOne of the major consequences of the WFD is the acquisition of large amounts of biological 478 \ninformation on the status of European surface waters, information that may improve our 479 \nknowledge of the structure of the communities inhabiting these ecosystems. Potentially, these 480 \ndata could contribute significantly to other objectives in addition to those of the WFD, e.g. for 481 \nmonitoring the effects of emerging stressors, for improving our knowledge of species 482 \ndistributions and species invasions, for understanding broad scale drivers shaping community 483 \nassemblages, for Habitats Directive\/Natura 2000 species inventories and biodiversity records. 484 \nHowever, as with the variability of methods employed for collecting data, the data structure, 485 \nquality and quantity are quite variable. This applies to the underlying taxonomy and 486 \ntaxonomic identification codes, taxonomic resolution, density of sampling sites, sampling 487 \nfrequency and data storage. As an example, according to Commission of the European 488 \nCommunities (2009) there are 428 river surveillance and operational monitoring sites in 489 \nHungary (corresponding to a density of 4.6 sites\/1,000 km\n2\n), but 2,731 sites in Ireland (38.9 490 \nsites \/ 1,000 km\n2\n). The density in Poland is 9.0 sites\/1,000 km\n2\n, but 49.0 sites\/1,000 km\n2\n in the 491 \nUK. While all these data will be useful to guide regional restoration programmes, Europe-492 \nwide comparisons can often be made on the coarsest resolution.  There are some exceptions to 493 \nthis, as part of the EC REBECCA Project, chemical and biological data from more than 5000 494 \nlakes in 20 European countries were compiled into pan-European databases incorporating 495 \ndata from phytoplankton, macrophytes, macroinvertebrates and fish (Moe et al., 2008). 496 \nAt present, Europe-wide comparisons are furthermore limited to data on the overall ecological 497 \nstatus and selected metrics, as the original data (e.g. taxa lists) are not being stored centrally, 498 \nwhich limits their potential for large-scale analyses and for purposes beyond the WFD. There 499 \nare, however, promising steps. WISE (Water Information System for Europe; 500 \nhttp:\/\/water.europa.eu) produces Europe-wide maps of water quality, currently only based on 501 \n 22 \nenvironmental variables. The European Environment Agency (EEA) is now also considering 502 \nproducing ecology-based WISE maps, and their test data request in 2009 resulted in more 503 \nthan 34,000 data records on individual BQEs from almost 10,000 sites in 17 countries. 504 \nMoreover, the European Commission and the EEA have launched the web-based SEIS 505 \n(Shared Environmental Information System), which will simplify the reporting and accessing 506 \nof environmental information. A useful future step would be to link data from all member 507 \nstates and from research projects to these systems without transferring data to any central 508 \ndatabase. This would be a major exercise, however, it would be worthwhile to make 509 \nmaximum use of the huge investment in biological recording. 510 \n 511 \nMonitoring: What is required by the WFD and what is useful? 512 \nMost countries focussed on operational monitoring: according to the Commission of the 513 \nEuropean Communities (2009) the number of operational monitoring sites is higher than the 514 \nnumber of surveillance monitoring sites in 17 out of 25 reported EU member states. 515 \nTherefore, the WFD approach is clearly orientated towards restoration: the monitoring results 516 \nshould reveal if and what type of restoration is needed and, in the future, if restoration was 517 \nsuccessful. The shortcoming of the operational monitoring is that it does not reveal long-term 518 \ntrends, which are independent of the local situation. Over-arching trends, such as the impact 519 \nof emerging stressors (climate change, land use change, new pollutants), changes in species 520 \ndistributions and ecological processes would be better revealed by a network of reference 521 \nsites. 522 \nThere are, however, exceptions to this at the national level. In France, the total number of 523 \nriver monitoring sites in 2000 was 1,560 and has been relatively constant since 1987. Most 524 \nsites were located in the downstream part of rivers and water agencies focused mainly on 525 \nchemical status. In 2007, the total number of monitored sites was 2,860: 1,276 for 526 \nsurveillance monitoring, 790 for operational monitoring and 794 for both monitoring 527 \n 23 \nprogrammes (OIWater 2009). This total number reached 4,337 in 2008, mainly in relation to 528 \nan increase in operational monitoring effort. Within the surveillance monitoring network, the 529 \nsite density per kilometre of river is now comparable between downstream and upstream 530 \nreaches, and the ecological status is assessed using 895 variables: water chemistry, biological 531 \nelements and hydro-morphological characteristics. To assess any long-term changes in 532 \nreference conditions in relation to large scale environmental change (e.g. global warming), 533 \nabout 400 sites characterized by a low level of human pressure and good biological quality 534 \nhave been selected to create a permanent reference condition monitoring network.  535 \nThe EEA EIONET or WISE stations may provide such a network Europe-wide, since these 536 \nare now being based on the WFD surveillance monitoring stations of the Member States. This 537 \n\u201ecentral monitoring network\u201f should address both high status sites to analyse long-term 538 \ntrends, irrespective of regional peculiarities, and a well-designed subset of degraded and 539 \nrestored sites to monitor the effects of both degradation and restoration over time. Ideally it 540 \nshould also be linked to the network of Long-Term Ecosystem Research sites (LTER; 541 \nhttp:\/\/www.lter-europe.net). 542 \n 543 \nThe WFD and other European legislation 544 \nThe WFD aims to link with some pre-existing EU directives and replace others. There are 545 \nseveral other directives which also aim to determine whether or not an area is affected by 546 \nhuman activities. For example the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), the Urban 547 \nWastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD), the Nitrates Directive (NiD) and the Habitats 548 \nand Species Directives (HSD) all require member states to check if an area is adversely 549 \naffected by pressures, with the ultimate goals to remedy any problems. The objectives of these 550 \ndirectives are not consistent in terms of terminology \u2013 for example, the WFD, the HSD and 551 \nthe MSFD expect areas to fulfil \u201egood ecological status\u201f, \u201efavourable conservation status\u201f and 552 \n\u201egood environmental status\u201f, respectively (Mee et al., 2008). For the directives to be 553 \n 24 \nharmonised, there is a presumption that these status classes are equivalent, especially as the 554 \ndesignated areas can overlap, including also the sensitive areas and the vulnerable zones of 555 \nthe UWWTD and NiD (see Common Implementation Strategy for the Water Framework 556 \nDirective, 2009). However, some areas are now being designated as being HMWB and yet 557 \nbeing in favourable conservation status (e.g. the upper part of the Humber Estuary, eastern 558 \nEngland). Accompanying this is a debate regarding the geographical limits of the directives, 559 \nin particular where the WFD stops at sea and where the MSFD starts. As yet, these anomalies 560 \nneed guidance before scientists are asked to determine whether \u201egood environmental status\u201f 561 \nand \u201egood ecological status\u201f (and favourable conservation status) are synonymous.  562 \nTable 3 shows how different directives, conventions and thematic strategies are related. 563 \nHence, the new MSFD (Commission of the European Communities, 2008; Mee et al., 2008), 564 \nas well as the WFD, constitutes an umbrella over the remainder of actions and directives, at 565 \nthe European and eco-regions level. Most of the existing directives are related to the lowest 566 \nlevel of the ecological organisation (species, habitats). However, WFD and MSFD are more 567 \ncomplete in terms of ecological structure, environmental quality and more integrative in terms 568 \nof ecological assessment (Borja et al., 2008a). 569 \nBoth directives integrate biological factors with physiographic, geographic and climatic 570 \nfactors and physico-chemical conditions resulting from human activities. While the WFD 571 \nfocuses on ecological status, measured by the structure of each of the BQEs and supporting 572 \nelements, the MSFD takes into account structure, function and processes in marine 573 \necosystems. Hence, the MSFD is potentially a more integrated approach to the management 574 \nof European seas, resources and ecosystems, promoting conservation and sustainable use of 575 \nmarine systems (Borja et al., 2008a). 576 \n 577 \nRiver Basin Management Plans 578 \n 25 \nDespite the potential value of the WFD monitoring data for many other purposes ranging 579 \nfrom biodiversity analyses in support of the Habitats Directive to basic ecological research, 580 \nthe principal aims are to identify restoration needs and to guide restoration measures. The 581 \ninstruments to implement these measures are River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs). In the 582 \nframework of River Basin Management Plans the costs for monitoring will be negligible 583 \nrelative to the costs of restoration measures. Operational monitoring should, therefore, be 584 \nregarded as an integral part of a RBMP. The linkage between monitoring data and the 585 \ndesignation of measures has not yet been fully explored but initial studies allow us to outline 586 \nthe following recommendations. 587 \n 588 \nEcological assessment and River Basin Management Plans: The challenge of bridging 589 \necology and management 590 \nOne of the most innovative aspects of the WFD is to base management decisions on the 591 \necological effects of pollution (or other stressors) rather than the pollution itself, 592 \nacknowledging that sensitivity and resilience to pollution varies substantially across 593 \necosystems. The associated challenge is to translate data on biotic communities into 594 \ninformation for restoration measures. This has now, in principle, already been done for the 595 \nfirst RBMPs. In reality, however, the links between ecological status and restoration measures 596 \nare obscure in many plans, due to the delayed development of assessment systems and 597 \ninitiation of monitoring programmes. Moreover, there has been no central guidance available 598 \non how to transfer ecological assessment results into management decisions.  599 \nIn many countries there was an intense consultation process in the drafting phase of the River 600 \nBasin Management Plans. Positive examples of a transparent consultation process are 601 \nNorthrhine-Westphalia (a federal state in Germany, see 602 \nhttp:\/\/www.flussgebiete.nrw.de\/Mitwirkung\/index.jsp) where round-table discussions in the 603 \nindividual river basin districts were organised involving a wide variety of stakeholders and 604 \n 26 \nthe Basque country in Spain were similar exercises have been performed over a three-year 605 \nperiod (http:\/\/www.uragentzia.euskadi.net\/u81-606 \n0003\/es\/contenidos\/informe_estudio\/planificacion_dma\/es_doc\/indice.html). In Finland the 607 \nstakeholder\u201fs involvement has been organised by regional environmental centres that have 608 \nestablished cooperation councils. A critical study of the participatory process was made by 609 \nNGOs (Laurinolli 2007). In general they found that stakeholders were well represented in the 610 \nprocess. However, during the first consultations the NGOs, the general public as well as the 611 \nmedia had not properly engaged in the process, possibly because they had not properly 612 \nunderstood the importance of the planning process for water management in the future. The 613 \nSwedish RBMPs demonstrate extensive and transparent involvement of local, regional, 614 \nnational and international stakeholders, including NGOs. Here, universities have been 615 \ninvolved in the training of local and regional water managers, the meetings held and the 616 \ncomments given are publicly available and summarised, accounts are given on how the 617 \ncomments have been taken into account when revising the RBMPs and conclusions on  the 618 \nlessons learnt are presented. Most river basin districts have established permanent 619 \norganisational structures called water councils for the large majority of separate river basins 620 \nwithin the RBDs. These water councils are comprised of representatives of a series of 621 \norganisations (environmental NGOs, local farmers, local enterprises, citizens) and have given 622 \ncomments on the various parts of the local RBMPs. 623 \nLinking ecological data and restoration measures is rather straightforward when dose-624 \nresponse relationships are simple and well-known, e.g. for organic pollution of rivers. It is 625 \ndifficult, however, in case of stressors, whose effects are less well known, and especially in 626 \nthe case of complex multiple stressor situations.  627 \nAs water quality has been improved in many parts of Europe (Lyche-Solheim et al., 2010), 628 \nriver rehabilitation nowadays focuses more on restoring habitats, and it is widely expected 629 \nthat benthic invertebrates, macrophytes and fish will respond positively. However, most 630 \n 27 \nrestoration measures have targeted relatively short river stretches and consequently biological 631 \nrecovery has not been achieved. This lack of restoration success is probably due to the need 632 \nfor more widespread improvement of habitat quality on the catchment scale and also on 633 \nrecolonization potential (J\u00e4hnig et al., 2009, Palmer et al., in press). In the case of transitional 634 \nand coastal waters, the ecological assessment exemplifies the problem of transboundary 635 \npollution pressures and the wider effect of stressors. Thus, transitional waters receive 636 \npollution from the whole catchment and may thus act as both a source to the sea and a sink 637 \nfrom the catchment, especially as they may be low energy, depositing areas and therefore 638 \neffects are exacerbated. In contrast, the quality of coastal waters is not only affected by river 639 \ncatchments but also by stressors in other marine areas. Hence, in order to design an 640 \nappropriate programme of measures, water managers are charged with untangling these 641 \nvarious pressures on a given area, and, therefore, will need significant scientific support.  642 \nFor the first cycle of River Basin Management Plans, biological assessment results were often 643 \nnot available prior to the planning process. Therefore, ecological assessment and planning 644 \nwere partly disentangled. An overview of all River Basin Management Plans can be found on 645 \nhttp:\/\/cdr.eionet.europa.eu\/ and on 646 \nhttp:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/environment\/water\/participation\/map_mc\/map.htm, covering the entire 647 \nrange from very general formulations of environmental targets to precise planning of 648 \nrestoration measures based on the results of the monitoring programmes. Positive examples 649 \nwhere management decisions have been based on large-scale considerations of the ecological 650 \nstatus and the requirements of the Biological Quality Elements are the German federal states 651 \nSchleswig Holstein (Brunke and Lietz in press) and Thuringia (Arle and Wagner, in press) 652 \nand the Dutch method to derive the Good Ecological Potential in Heavily Modified Water 653 \nBodies (e.g. Lammens et al. 2008). General suggestions which measures affect which 654 \norganism group are amongst others found in Kail and Wolters (in press). A promising 655 \n 28 \nexample from marine ecosystems can be found on http:\/\/www.uragentzia.euskadi.net\/u81-656 \n0003\/es\/contenidos\/informe_estudio\/diagnostico_agua\/es_doc\/indice.html.   657 \nTo make the maximum use of the biological data presently being recorded it is essential to 658 \nmake dose-response relationships between stressors and the biotic response available to all 659 \nriver basin managers well before the design of the second cycle of RBMPs and provide 660 \nscientific guidance on the most simple and effective restoration measures appropriate to 661 \nenhance ecological quality.  662 \nThere is a danger that some of the measures listed in the RBMPs cannot be implemented in 663 \npractice due to a lack of political instruments to enforce their implementation, e.g. to seriously 664 \nreduce diffuse pollution sources. Only the coming years will show which measures are 665 \nactually implemented, and which political instruments need to be developed that will 666 \nguarantee their enforcement. 667 \n 668 \nIs good status enough? 669 \nThe aim of the WFD is to reach good status for all water bodies which are not designated as 670 \n\u201eheavily modified\u201f. Good status is defined as a \u201eslight deviation from reference conditions\u201f 671 \nand moderate status is \u201emoderate deviation from reference conditions\u201f. Hence scientists are 672 \ncharged with determining reference conditions in quantitative terms, as well as the meaning of 673 \n\u201eslight\u201f and \u201emoderate\u201f. The first intercalibration revealed that for some BQEs and water 674 \ncategories there is a common understanding amongst scientific experts of the meaning of 675 \n\u201egood status\u201f \u2013 despite large differences in assessment systems.  676 \nThe question arises what will be gained if \u201egood status\u201f of the majority of European water 677 \nbodies will be achieved? Water bodies in good status will have an acceptable water quality 678 \nand will be characterised by the absence of other severe stresses. But, are they sufficient to 679 \nmaintain European aquatic biodiversity and associated functions and services?  680 \n 29 \nIn terms of protecting aquatic biodiversity high status sites may play a key role: Species 681 \nrichness and the number of sensitive species differ greatly between \u201egood\u201f and \u201ehigh\u201f status 682 \nsites. For example, Aroviita et al. (2009) noted clear differences between high and good 683 \nquality classes, with fewer occurrences and lower abundances of threatened species at sites 684 \nclassified as good compared to high ecological quality. Individual high status sites are not 685 \nnecessarily characterised by a high alpha-diversity (e.g. in case of ultra-oligotrophic lakes and 686 \nmarine water bodies), but there are several species and possibly genotypes restricted to sites 687 \nof high ecological quality. High status sites, therefore, are required to maintain a high level of 688 \nbeta- and gamma diversity. The resulting need for the protection of high status sites is 689 \nsomewhat implied by the WFD which prohibits the deterioration of ecological status. 690 \nA possible solution would be a network of \u201ehigh status sites\u201f as key areas for protecting 691 \naquatic biodiversity. These could also serve to underpin how natural (climate) variability 692 \naffects the uncertainty in our assessment of type I and II errors of putative perturbed sites. 693 \n 694 \nHow does ecological status respond to restoration? 695 \nWFD monitoring for the first River Basin Management Plan was focussed on assessing the 696 \npresent status of a water body. The ultimate aim of monitoring, however, is to detect change, 697 \ni.e. the deterioration of ecological status or the improvement following restoration \/ 698 \nrehabilitation. Assessment systems should therefore give general guidance on the measures 699 \nrequired.  700 \nThe challenge is to predict how the biota will respond to restoration and what management 701 \nactions are best suited. These questions are easier to answer for lakes and marine ecosystems, 702 \nwhich are predominantly affected by eutrophication and where the main restoration measure 703 \nis the reduction of nutrient load. It is more difficult for rivers, which are also affected by 704 \nhydromorphological degradation on different spatial scales and transitional waters where 705 \nincreased turbidity and a naturally poor light regime complicates the response. The concepts 706 \n 30 \nof how organism groups respond to restoration measures are clear (rivers: Hering et al. 2006; 707 \nlakes: Jeppesen et al. 2005; estuaries and marine areas: Elliott et al. 2007). However, there is a 708 \nlack of empirical data on relevant geographical and long-term scales required for assessing 709 \nrestoration \/ rehabilitation success. It is unlikely that operational monitoring can be used to 710 \nobtain this type of knowledge as sampling frequency and locations are often too coarse; 711 \nusually there is a single sampling site per water body, which may cover several kilometres of 712 \nriver length. 713 \nOne possible solution would be dedicated monitoring of a subset of water bodies subject to 714 \nrestoration measures with more sampling sites and higher sampling frequency both before and 715 \nafter restoration. Ideally, restoration studies, and indeed all studies of disturbance and 716 \nrecovery, should be based on deviation from an undisturbed condition. A robust statistical 717 \ndesign would include three types of sites: (i) restored sites, (ii) target or control (reference) 718 \nsites, and (iii) sites similarly impaired as those restored but not restored (e.g. Downes et al., 719 \n2002). Experiences with the effects of restoration should be collected centrally (ideally 720 \nEurope wide) and be made available for all users. 721 \n 722 \nEcological and political timescales 723 \nThe aims of the WFD are ambitious and clearly defined: By 2015, all water bodies (with the 724 \nexception of heavily modified water bodies) need to reach good status, with a possible 725 \nextension for another 12 years. There is, however, overwhelming evidence that across much 726 \nof Europe even this extended time frame may not be sufficient to reach \u201egood ecological 727 \nstatus\u201f. Recovery of biotic communities requires the implementation of measures and the 728 \nresponse of the ecosystem \u2013 both steps need many years, sometimes decades. Jones and 729 \nSchmitz (2009) give a broad overview of time scales required for recovery. The authors 730 \nreviewed 240 recovery studies across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and found mean 731 \nrecovery times of 10 to 20 years for freshwater, brackish and marine systems. In all systems, 732 \n 31 \nmacrophyte recovery was slowest, except for rivers where functional recovery required most 733 \ntime. But the authors also stressed that pre-perturbation data were available for only 20% of 734 \nthe reviewed studies, a factor that rendered the assessment of recovery in 80% of the studies 735 \nrather subjective. 736 \nRestoration measures in rivers mainly depend on the availability of floodplain area. It is a 737 \nlong process to acquire space for the river floodplain. State-of-the-art \u201epassive\u201f restoration 738 \nrequires the development of near-natural vegetation in the floodplain, which may take several 739 \ndecades (Kail and Hering, 2005). Reducing eutrophication in all water categories may require 740 \nchanges in land use on large scales. As a consequence, water and habitat quality required for 741 \ngood status can not be achieved everywhere within one or two decades.  742 \nAccording to Jeppesen et al. (2005) reduced external phosphorus loading in lakes resulted in a 743 \nnew equilibrium for total phosphorus within 10 to 15 years, restoration of many biological 744 \nvariables generally took much longer. For four well-studied coastal ecosystems, Duarte et al. 745 \n(2009) did not observe a return of simple biological variables (such as chlorophyll 746 \nconcentration) following the reduction of nutrient loads over a time span of two decades. In 747 \nsome marine ecosystems nutrient residence times are on the order of decades, like in the 748 \nBaltic Sea and, therefore, significant effects are unlikely to be achieved for the whole marine 749 \narea by 2015. However coastal bays, lagoons and archipelogo areas that have lower residence 750 \ntimes and  are generally impacted by land-based nutrient inputs; here, effects of River Basin 751 \nManagement Plans are potentially visible within the WFD implementation time scale of 5 to 752 \n15 years (Kauppila et al., 2005). There are several examples, both in coastal and transitional 753 \nwaters, in which recovery can take between 2 and 15 years after a pressure is removed (Borja 754 \net al. 2006, 2009b, 2009d; Uriarte and Borja, 2009). Perhaps the best example of restoration 755 \nin transitional waters is the recovery of the fish community in the Thames estuary passing 756 \nthrough London. It took several decades to acquire a full species complement after starting 757 \nfrom a state without any fish in the 1960s (McLusky and Elliott, 2004).  758 \n 32 \nSensitive species, which are required for a \u201egood ecological status\u201f, have been brought to 759 \nextinction in entire catchments, particularly in densely populated areas throughout Europe. 760 \nRestoring water quality and habitats does not automatically mean that sensitive species will 761 \nreappear. It depends on source populations, colonization paths \u2013 and sufficient time 762 \nacknowledging that we have been degrading aquatic systems in Europe since the start of the 763 \nindustrial revolution in the early 1800s.  764 \nIn conclusion, we cannot expect European aquatic ecosystems to fully recover within 15 or 765 \neven 30 years from over a century of degradation. Where restoration measures and land use 766 \nchanges can be implemented rapidly there will in many cases be improvements of ecological 767 \nstatus within this time span, although not necessarily all the way to good status. The overall 768 \naim to reach good status for most European water bodies is ambitious but not realistic in the 769 \ngiven timeframe. 770 \n 771 \nHow do we deal with emerging stressors? 772 \nThe WFD and corresponding assessment schemes mainly focus (and were designed to focus) 773 \non \u201etraditional stressors\u201f, such as eutrophication, organic pollution, acidification, toxic 774 \nstressors and to a lesser degree hydromorphological pressure. Other stressors have more 775 \nrecently come into focus, such as such as climate change, siltation, new toxic substances and 776 \nalien species. Diagnostic metrics are currently only available for common types of 777 \ndegradation. Therefore, there is a need to focus on whole ecosystem and community structure 778 \nand functioning. Pollution response science assumes that changes to individual organisms due 779 \nto pollution will be transmitted through the ecosystem and manifested at the community level. 780 \nHowever, we know that systems have an inherent ability to absorb stress (Elliott and 781 \nQuintino, 2007) and so effects of stressors on individuals may not necessarily be reflected in 782 \nthe metrics currently being used for the WFD. The science now needs to be developed to look 783 \nat response trajectories and the resilience of ecosystems (Elliott et al., 2007). 784 \n 33 \nOne possible solution to include climate change effects is to assess the impact of climate 785 \nchange on existing WFD metrics and then adjust the existing assessment systems accordingly. 786 \nAnother way is to add \u201eclimate specific components\u201f to assessment systems, e.g. metrics 787 \nparticularly reflecting the temperature sensitivity of species. More generally, assessment 788 \nschemes should allow for a certain degree of flexibility, to address changes which will be 789 \nrelevant in the future. The overall design of WFD compliant assessment is well suited to 790 \ndetect the effects of emerging stressors, as changes in biotic communities irrespective of their 791 \ncauses are monitored.  792 \n 793 \nConclusions 794 \nThe EU Water Framework Directive is a very ambitious piece of environmental legislation 795 \nwhich places aquatic ecology in the centre of water management. The performance of 796 \necological assessment under the WFD varies between regional, national and European scales, 797 \nacross seasons and ecosystems types (lakes, rivers and coastal\/transitional waters).  798 \nThe monitoring data can directly support RBMPs on a regional scale. These data will provide 799 \nguidance for restoration measures and evaluate their success. At the national scale monitoring 800 \ndata already provide an overview of the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems, at least in 801 \nsome countries, while at the European level the options provided by the data still need to be 802 \nfully exploited. 803 \nThe value of monitoring per se is in analysing trends over time. Presently, the spatial 804 \nresolution of WFD monitoring data is high, though somewhat different between European 805 \ncountries. As the first phase of monitoring has just ended, there is yet no assessment of trends; 806 \nthe monitoring data will be important both for judging short-term effects of individual 807 \nrestoration measures and for analysing long term trends. The particular value of the WFD 808 \nmonitoring data lies in the combination of a high spatial and a moderate temporal resolution. 809 \n 34 \nMany European countries had a long tradition in biological monitoring of rivers; 810 \nconsequently, river assessment methods are now relatively well developed and intercalibrated 811 \nHowever, rivers are very diverse and complex systems and assessment systems are often less 812 \npredictable compared to those developed for lakes and coastal\/transitional waters. At the same 813 \ntime rivers may provide deeper insight into causes of degradation, which are more complex 814 \ndue to the greater role of hydromorphological stress. 815 \nMuch has been achieved with the implementation of the WFD, but many challenges remain to 816 \nmake optimal use of the unique monitoring data being acquired in order to achieve a 817 \nmaximum improvement in the ecological quality of European surface waters. 818 \n 819 \nAcknowledgements 820 \nThis paper is a result of the project WISER (Water bodies in Europe: Integrative Systems to 821 \nassess Ecological status and Recovery) funded by the European Union under the 7\nth\n 822 \nFramework Programme, Theme 6 (Environment including Climate Change) (contract No. 823 \n226273), www.wiser.eu.
