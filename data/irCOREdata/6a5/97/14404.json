It will then be\npossible to speak in your native tongue to a Frenchman, a Japanese and a Russian, and for\neach of them to hear your words spoken in their own language as you speak. In The\nHitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Adams, 1979) it becomes possible to understand\ncommunication in any language by plugging a Babel fish into your ear - a fish with the\nnatural ability to receive speech in any language and translate it into the language of the\nperson wearing it. While these visions are certainly futuristic, even fantastic, the need for\npeople knowing different languages to communicate quickly and easily is rapidly increasing at\nthe same time as the technology for transmitting and receiving information is spreading and\nbecoming more powerful.\nAttempts to create international languages have not been very successful, partly because of the\nneed for a significant number of people to know them, and partly because they have to be\nlearned like any other new language. Understanding is, however, possible across language\n26\nALTJ VOLUME 1NUMBER 1\nbarriers in at least two ways. First, there are a number of internationally recognized signs,\nsymbols and icons which one can find on the roadside and in airports, railway stations and\nsimilar places. They are not only used directly to denote the place where one might find trains\nor change money, but may also contain a number of 'meta-icons' such as the red diagonal and\nthe arrow. Secondly, it is possible to make oneself understood, at least at some basic level, by\nmeans of gestures and mime. People who find themselves in a country where they know little\nor nothing of the local language can often communicate simple ideas by pointing or indicating\ntheir intentions through more performative signs, which may border on acting.\nIconic communication is the attempt to build cross-language communication systems1 that\ncompletely avoid the use of words and rely solely on pictorial symbols. The system which\nmanipulates these symbols should be as simple to use as possible, though it is clear that it has\nto be learned in some way. There are various forms of learning which can apply: users can\nreceive some form of instruction (either by a tutor, or by some non-linguistic tutorial system);\nthe elements of the system can contain an explanation of their meaning ('self-explaining\nicons'); the system can adopt a powerful metaphor; or the user can experiment and learn by\ntrial and error.\nIcons\nIt is important to say first of all what we mean by an icon. Figure 1 contains various ways of\nreferring to 'men', and they vary from the arbitrary (Figure la) to the pictorially descriptive\n(Figure Id). Icons tend to exist between these extremes (Figures lb and lc).\nFigure 1: Different ways of referring to 'men'\nWords are essentially arbitrary in the way they refer, so there is no alternative but to learn\ntheir meaning. Of course words may be morphologically complex (spaceship, for example),\nbut the components themselves are ultimately atomic and have arbitrary referents. With icons,\nthe relationship to the referent is not arbitrary, but neither is it as direct as in the case of\npictures. It would be quite wrong to see pictures as an ideal form of icon because there are a\nnumber of things they are not good at expressing. For example, it is difficult to draw a\n27\nColin Beardon et al. Talking with pictures: iconic communication\nnaturalistic picture of love or of general classes of things, such as the class of all mammals.\nFor the purpose of pictorial language, pictures reveal too much information: the man in Figure\nl(d) might stand for businessmen, middle-aged men, or any of a number of other\ninterpretations. Quite apart from this, the amount of detail means that differentiation from\nother symbols is not so easy, and therefore recognition can be considerably slower than with\nthe more stylized forms.\nWhile an icon suggests its referent, its form is often insufficient to describe it precisely. What\nadvantage, then, does it give us over words? There are two reasons for which an icon can be\nadvantageous: it can be easier to learn and easier to\nremember. It can be easier to learn because its\nappearance at least suggests a set of possible referents\nand because it is often part of a consistent system of\nrepresentation which itself will provide a context. For\nexample, the symbol in Figure 2 is given its reference\nby being placed on a white background in a red triangle\non a black and white striped poll beside a road. This\ntells us immediately that it is a sign intended for drivers\nand concerns some potential hazard. It can be easier to\nFigure 2: A hump-backed bridge r e m e m b e r b e c a u s e i l i s a well-known aid to memory to\nassociate the thing to be remembered with a simple\nobject to which it has a defined relationship. For\nexample, to remember the French word for pig (cochon)\nI may think that it sounds like the English word cushion. I therefore associate the concept of\nthe French for pig with an image of a cushion, and this serves as an aid to memory.2 This\nillustrates well the fact that an icon does not necessarily have to be directly representational\nbut can indicate its reference by means of a convention, as in Figure l(b). Such conventions\nare of course also applicable to user-interfaces, including those in CAL programs.\nIconic languages\nIt has been suggested that most modern written languages are derived from pictorial\nlanguages, but iconic languages seem to be a more recent invention. Some of the more\ninteresting examples are Semantography (Blis, 1965), Isotype (International System Of\nTypographic Picture Education) (Neurath, 1978) and Worldsign (Jones and Cregan, 1986), a\nlanguage created for mentally handicapped children which allows dynamic representation.\nIn Semantography (or Bliss symbols), one symbol corresponds to one word in natural\nlanguage. It was proposed as an auxiliary writing tool for communication between different\nnations, and as a device to specify relative and vague meanings. The aim of the language is to\ncommunicate through simple pictorial symbols, with those representing physical things using\noutline and those representing non-physical things using geometric symbols. The first 25\nsymbols are already internationally accepted; they include the digits 0 to 9 and symbols such\nas a question mark, a full stop and a plus sign.\nBliss based his grammar on the assumption that all languages are used to describe the\nphenomena of our physical world, that the main manifestations of our world can be classified\ninto matter, energy and the mental, and that everything happens in space and time. There is a\n28\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nspecific logic behind symbols constructed to represent words. A word like telephone takes its\nsymbolization from the symbols for electric and language (a telephone is an electrical\napparatus in which you can talk) and the language symbol is derived from the ear and mouth\nsymbols (both used in conversation).\nThe Isotype picture language does not have a simple correspondence between signs and\nwords. An example given by Neurath is that there is no sign for the word foot that is common\nto expressions such as the foot of a man, the foot of mountain, and the foot of a table. These\nexpressions are composed of simple signs of a very different sort. Furthermore, the final\ntranslation of the 'language picture' is a structured group of statements, and the system of\nconnection between signs is far richer than in linear text. Several rows of connected signs are\ninterpreted simultaneously, whereas one-dimensional text requires readers to bear in mind\nwhat they have read and to make connections between dispersed elements for themselves.\nNeurath's writing suggests two central rules for generating the vocabulary of an international\npicture language: reduction, for determining the style of individual signs, and consistency, for\ngiving a group of signs the appearance of a coherent system. Then there needs to be a set of\nconventions to allow the user to know how the information is structured. Neurath's work was\ndirected towards making statistical charts. He introduced two basic rules: the first of these\nrelated to the presentation of statistics by means of icons, and held that a icon represents a\ncertain quantity or amount of things and that more signs represent a greater quantity or\namount. The second was a general rule that perspective should not be used. His work includes\na series of posters for an anti-tuberculosis campaign (non-statistical) and the publication of\nmany books and charts.\nThe Bliss approach is similar to text-based language and susceptible to some of the same\npitfalls, but it presents some interesting insights for an international human-human computer\nsystem. Isotype in its present form is best suited for statistics and is too restricted for a\ncomputer environment but it could be seen as a precursor of an iconic computer language.\nComputer-based icons\nThe computer provides a significant new environment for the use of icons. Whereas previous\nsystems of icons have been essentially textual, their messages are one-dimensional sequences\nof icons in which everything is explicit. Each icon has its reference, and icons are placed in\nsequences (occasionally there are sub- and super-scripts) with blank spaces to indicate\ngrouping.\nThe typical windows environment on a modern computer provides a much richer\nenvironment. First, there are fully two dimensions to exploit so that any grammar which\nexploits relative positioning of icons is not restricted in the way that text-based languages\nhave been (though from a practical point of view there are limits on how much one can\npresent at one time). There is also the possibility of using colour (or greyscale) and animation.\nMost importantly, an icon in a computer environment needs to be defined both\nrepresentationally and operationally. In addition to asking what an icon represents\n(pictorially), one can also ask what happens when the user clicks on it, or double-clicks on it,\nor clicks-and-drags it to some other part of the screen. Here we are opening up a world in\nwhich the sentence 'Don't look for the meaning, look for the use' has a new potency. The\n29\nColin Beardon et al. Talking with pictures: iconic communication\nmeaning of an icon is no longer simply what it resembles, but also what happens when you do\nsomething with it. This realization gives a dramatic new lease of life to what may appear to\nhave been a marginalized form of communication.\nThe remainder of this paper describes some of the work we have undertaken so far in this\narea. It is centred around two example systems: a hotel booking system (developed at the\nUniversity of Exeter) and CD-Icon (developed at Brighton Polytechnic). While the hotel\nbooking example does not relate specifically to learning technology, the principles on which it\nis based are relevant to any user-interface design, and CD-Icon has obvious similar relevance.\nExample 1 - Hotel booking system\nHotel booking is a typical activity that requires communication across language barriers. It\noffers us the opportunity to apply iconic language in a simple dialogue between a potential\nguest and a hotel or city-wide hotel booking facility. In a final system we can envisage a\ntouch-sensitive screen with plenty of interaction, but at this stage of development we are\nconcerned with the initial formulation of a request by the customer that will be transmitted to\na hotel for the compilation of a reply. A demonstration system has been built using\nHyperCard.\nThe compilation of the booking message is accomplished in stages, and at each stage the\ncurrent context is cued by a picture resident in the background. In sequence these are: a\n'typical' hotel front (Figure 3), a 'typical' hotel reception area (Figure 4), and a 'typical' hotel\nbedroom (Figure 5). Each new screen holds the background picture before the other\ninformation is faded in over it.\nThe initial screen shows a hotel overlaid by an appropriate caption, and clicking anywhere on\nthe image starts the booking sequence. The first screen invites the user to indicate the\nintended destination (the name of a town or a hotel) and grade of hotel, by selecting from\ncyclable 'star' ratings (Figure 3). Movement to the next screen is initiated by clicking on the\n'tick' icon, a convention used throughout the package.\nThe second screen (Figure 4) shows a hotel reception area and invites selection of the dates\nand times of arrival and departure. The number of nights that are implied by these dates and\ntimes is indicated by black bars which appear (and disappear) as each night is added (or\nremoved). Once again, the 'tick' icon moves the user to the next screen.\nThe third screen (Figure 5) shows a room overlaid with icons permitting the selection of\nrooms and their required facilities. A room is shown as a white rectangle. One room is shown\ninitially and the number of rooms can be altered by clicking on the '+ ' and '- ' icons. Four\nicons at the top right of the screen each unlock further related icons to enable the selection,\nfor each room, of: (a) the number and type of occupants, (b) the number and type of beds, (c)\nthe type of bathroom facilities, and (d) the range of other facilities required. The various\nfeatures are selected by clicking on an icon which causes a clone to be produced beside it,\nwhich is then dragged into the relevant room. The 'tick' icon moves the user to screen 4\n(Figure 6) which displays the complete booking requirement. If this is satisfactory a further\n'tick' sends the message to the hotel.\n30\nALTJ VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nFigure 3: Screen inviting input of destination\nFigure 4: Screen inviting selection of dates and times of arrival and departure\n31\nColin Beardon et al. Talking with pictures: iconic communication\nFigure 5: Screen allowing selection of room types and facilities\nFigure 6: Screen displaying complete booking requirements\n32\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nFigure 7: Screen showing availability of 'star' ratings\nThe message is revealed to the hotel in stages. Confirmation of the acceptability of each part\nof the message (tick) moves on to the next part of the message, whilst unavailability (cross)\nbrings up a range of possible alternatives. Figure 7 shows that the required dates of stay are\nacceptable but the requested hotel grade is unavailable. The hotel is therefore presented with\nfour options to propose in reply.\nOnce the entire message has been processed by the hotel in this way, the final message is sent\nback to the customer who will be able to accept or reject the alternatives offered, continue the\ndialogue, and confirm a booking.\nThe application, as it stands, does not pretend to be either comprehensive or the most practical\nsolution in real terms, but is an initial attempt to create a simple, interactive, iconic dialogue\nusing hotel booking as a convenient theme. It does, however, offer much that could be used in\na real system, and serves its purpose in starting to explore the possibility of communicating\nwith icons.\nExample 2 - the CD-Icon language\nThe CD-Icon system is an attempt to build an iconic communication system based on the\nprinciples that underlie natural-language processing systems. The standard way of specifying\nsemantics in such systems is to assume some other system (a Meaning Representation\nLanguage, or MRL) for which the semantics are already known (Woods, 1978). The task then\nbecomes that of expressing rules by means of which statements in natural language are\ntransformed into statements into the MRL, and vice versa. Schank's Conceptual Dependency\nrepresentation (Schank, 1973) is an MRL in this sense, and its own semantics are either taken\nto be intuitive, or are established by their success in various practical projects, for example\nMARGIE (Schank, 1975) and PAM (Wilensky, 1981).\nCD-Icon is a means of testing the validity of Conceptual Dependency directly by making it\nthe basis of a communication system that uses only icons and no words. A message is\ncomposed by selecting options from a series of interconnected screens (in the spirit of\n33\nColin Beardon et al. Talking with pictures: iconic communication\nsystemic grammar). The message is then transmitted, also as a set of interconnected screens,\nbut not showing options that have not been selected.\nWe will illustrate the system by composing the message equivalent to 'The big man went\nhome'. Figure 8 shows the message expressed in Schank's CD formalism.\nPTRANS * ^ man\nFigure 8 Schank's CD representation of 'The big man went home'\nIn CD-Icon a message is composed in four stages. The first stage is concerned with what\nSchank calls 'conceptual relations' and 'conceptual tenses'. A screen is presented (Figure 9)\nwhich enables the user to select an assertion, a question or an imperative, between simple and\ncompound messages, and to decide upon negation. If the message is compound, the nature of\nthe relationship between the two component conceptualizations is chosen (logical AND,\nlogical OR, implication, temporal or spatial).\nClicking on an icon for a conceptualization transfers control to stage 2 which is typically\nconcerned with an event. Events, according to Schank, are based around a primitive 'act' so\nthe first selection is between icons representing various primitive 'acts' (Figure 10). To assist\nthe user, a Help facility presents a short animated explanation, in the manner of Mealing and\nYazdani (1990). Having selected the appropriate 'act', the corresponding screen is presented.\nIn this example it is the PTRANS screen which is shown in Figure 11. It contains a basic\nbackground for PTRANS with grey icons representing the object, origin, destination and\ninstrument cases, as well as tense. (There is a divergence from Schank here in that we do not\nuse the agent case.) Grey icons denote options, whereas black-and-white icons represent\nselections. A grey house, for example, represents the class of places, the grey question mark\nrepresents the class of objects, the grey clock represents the class of times, and the grey spade\nrepresents the class of instrument cases.\nClicking on any one of these icons (except the clock or spade) will result in transfer to stage 3\nwhich is concerned with the production of what Schank refers to as a 'picture'. The 'picture'\n34\nALTJ VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nFigure 9: Screen for selecting a simple assertive sentence\nFigure 10: Selecting a primitive 'act'\n35\nColin Beardon et aL Talking with pictures: iconic communication\nFigure 11: The screen for PTRANS\nFigure 12: Picture screen for 'big man'\n36\nALTJ VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nFigure 13: A screen from the lexicon\nFigure 14: The four screens representing the complete message\n37\nColin Beardon et al Talking with pictures: iconic communication\nscreen initially contains only the head icon (the icon that was clicked on at stage 2). This will\neventually be defined along with any modifiers to produce the screen in Figure 12.\nClicking on the 'head' icon will result in transfer to stage 4 which is the lexicon, or rather that\npart of the lexicon which contains objects of the type specified by the grey icon (see Figure\n13). The user selects an appropriate icon, in this case the one for 'man', and control is\nreturned to the 'picture' screen (stage 3). There are two changes however: the selected icon\nreplaces the grey icon, and those classes of object which normally modify the 'head' icon are\nshown in grey.\nThe user can click on any of these modifying icons and be taken to the appropriate part of the\nlexicon to select the precise colour, size, location, etc. In our example, there is one modifier,\n'big', and the outcome of stage 3 is shown in Figure 12. When the user is satisfied, the tick\nbox is clicked and the grey icons are deleted. Control is passed back to the PTRANS screen\n(stage 2) with an icon composed of the head icon from the picture plus an asterisk in the top\nright corner. If this new icon is selected in Help mode, the full iconic representation will be\ndisplayed. The process is repeated for all icons which the user decides to specify.\nTemporal reference is established with respect to an imported clock icon representing 'now'\n(set at 6 o'clock). A clock internal to the 'act' can be set at 'past', 'present' or 'future' (3, 6,\nor 9 o'clock). In our example, the past tense is used.\nThe instrument case is handled differently. In Schank's system the instrument case never\npoints to an object, but always to a conceptualization. In CD-Icon, control will be passed\nrecursively to stage 2 to devise a new conceptualization, which will be represented by a new\nicon (a black spade with an asterisk) by means of which the instrument case can be made\nexplicit.\nWhen the user is satisfied, clicking on the tick box will return control to the message-level\nscreen (stage 1) with an icon for PTRANS plus an asterisk in the top right corner. The final,\nmessage will be represented by the four interconnected screens shown in Figure 14.\nAt present the system is being used to explore the validity of MRLs and the possibility of\nunrestricted communication by icons. It is hoped to soon have a system that will allow users\nto try to compose and understand simple messages, at which point empirical testing will take\nplace.\nFuture directions\nThese two projects have already raised some important issues. We need to distinguish\ndifferent communicative tasks, for example to distinguish between an iconic system that\nserves as a front-end to existing computer software and an iconic system for person-to-person\ncommunication. This distinction seems to mirror the distinction between systems that have a\nknown MRL and those that do not.\nThe systems also raise the possibility of a complete escape from linguistic forms. At present\nthere is a tendency to explain them with reference to linguistic examples \u2014 that is to say, one\ntries to compose a message that corresponds to a sentence which has already been formulated\nin English. The intention is, however, to escape from this and view the systems as\ncommunication channels in their own right. The output should not be verbalized, except\n38\nALT-J VOLUME 1 NUMBER 1\nperhaps in some indirect way in order to test the degree to which communication has taken\nplace.\nThis raises the question of the form of the communication itself. In the hotel booking system\nit is a single screen, whereas in CD-Icon it is a set of connected screens. The question is being\nconsidered, particularly when dealing with larger texts, of whether an animated screen may\nnot be more appropriate. In the case of our second example, the 'man' icon could appear\nmoving to a house. This would be no ordinary animation, for the actors would be iconic and\nthe animation may be stopped at any point and icons selected to reveal more information\nabout themselves.\nNotes\n1. Cross-language communication means communication irrespective of the language spoken\nby the participants. It is distinguished from cross-cultural communication which raises a\nnumber of specific problems, and while we can see how cross-cultural issues might be\naddressed, to date little research has been carried out in the area.\n2. This system of language learning has been commercially exploited (Gruneberg 1987-1992,\nGruneberg and Jacobs, 1991).\nReferences\nAdams, D.
