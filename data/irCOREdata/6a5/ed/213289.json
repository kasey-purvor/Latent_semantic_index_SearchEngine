As the victor in a bloody civil \nwar which inflamed passions throughout the world, that is hardly \nsurprising. Leaving aside his personal political success in remaining in \npower for nearly four decades, his victory in the Spanish Civil War \nwas his greatest and most glorious achievement, something reflected in \nthe judgements of detractors and hagiographers alike. For the left, \nFranco the general was a slow-witted mediocrity whose battlefield \ntriumphs were owed entirely to the unstinting military assistance of \nHitler and Mussolini. For the right, Franco the general was the \ntwentieth-century incarnation of Alexander the Great, of Napoleon and \nof the great warrior hero of Spanish legend, El Cid. \nBeyond the propagandistic excesses of the Caudillo's wilder syco- \nphants, however, what is altogether more remarkable is that both his \nwartime allies and the most sober judges from his own side have \nconcurred in a generally critical view of his prowess as a military leader. \nThe views of both Fuihrer and Duce, for instance, could barely have \nbeen more hostile. Hitler commented at a dinner in 1942, 'Franco and \ncompany can consider themselves very lucky to have received the help \nof Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany in their first civil war \n... The intervention of the German General von Richthofen and the \nbombs his squadrons rained from the heavens decided the issue'.' \nDuring the Civil War, Hitler's first diplomatic envoy General Wilhelm \nFaupel was frequently scathing in his dispatches about the painful \nslowness of Franco's military leadership.2 The Italians were equally \ncritical. In December 1937, outraged at Franco's apparent inability to \npress home the advantage of his superior forces, the Italian Foreign \nMinister Count Ciano wrote in his diary 'Franco has no idea of \nsynthesis in war.'3 During the battle of the Ebro in 1938, the Duce \nhimself protested about Franco's 'flabby conduct of the war', telling \nCiano, 'Put on record in your diary that today, 29 August, I prophesy \n'[Adolf Hitler], Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944 (1953), 569. \n'See, for instance, Documents onGerman Foreign Policy Series D, III (1951), 408-10. \n3Galeazzo Ciano, Ciano's Diary 1937-1938 (1952), 46. \n21 \n22 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY \nthe defeat of Franco. Either the man doesn't know how to make war \nor he doesn't want to. The reds are fighters, Franco is not.'4 \nThe views of Franco's German and Italian allies might be dismissed \nas ill-founded on the grounds of distance and lack of familiarity with \nSpanish conditions. However, equally negative, albeit more cautiously \nexpressed, criticisms came from within the Generalisimo's own military \nestablishment. Two such assessments of Franco as strategist emanated \nfrom the heart of the Nationalist high command-General Alfredo \nKindelhn Duany, the Chief of Franco's Air Force, and Colonel (later \nGeneral) Jorge Vig6n Suerodiaz, Chief of Staff irst o the Army of the \nNorth and then to Franco himself. During the early stages of the war, \nVig6n wrote several etters to KindelAn, urging him to use his influence \nwith the Generalisimo to bring about a change of strategy and an \nacceleration of operations. Kindelan wrote memoirs in the immediate \naftermath of the war in which he revealed his own and Vig6n's \nreservations about Franco's overall conduct of the war. Permission for \ntheir publication was withheld until 1945 and even then the criticisms \nof Franco as a strategist were cut from the text and not restored until \nthe second edition which was published seven years after the Caudillo's \ndeath. \nIn relation, for example, to Franco's failure to seize the opportunity \nopened up by the fall of Bilbao in July 1937 for a rapid sweep through \nthe north, Kindelan wrote: 'the enemy was defeated but was not \npursued; the success was not exploited, the withdrawal was not turned \ninto a disaster. This was due to the fact that while the tactical conception fthe \noperation was masterly, as was its execution, the strategic conception on the other \nhand was much more modest.' The italicised passage was suppressed along \nwith many others.5 In his own diaries, not published until 1970, it is \npossible to discern Vig6n's frustration with those of Franco's military \ndecisions which delayed major advances.6 Subsequently, the Francoist \narmy's most distinguished official historians have also been discreetly \ncritical of their Commander-in-Chief.7 \nWhat all these criticisms, whether German, Italian or Spanish, have \nin common is the belief that Franco could have speeded up the progress \n4Ciano, Diay 37-38, I48. \n5Compare Alfredo Kindelan, Mis cuadernos de guerra 1936-1939 (Madrid, n.d. [1945], \n86 and Mis cuadernos de guerra 1936-1939 2\" edici6n (Barcelona, 1982), 9, 127. All subsequent \nreferences are to the 2nd edition. \n6Jorge Vig6n Suerodiaz, Cuadernos de guerray notas de paz (Oviedo, 197), 49-50, 212. \n7It is remarkable, for instance, that Franco is a shadowy figure in the seventeen- \nvolume set of Monografias de la guerra de EspaAa produced by the Spanish Army's Servicio \nHist6rico Militar under the direction of Colonel Jose Manuel Martinez Bande, (Madrid, \n1968-1985). See also the critical comments on Franco's generalship to be found throughout \nGenerals Ram6n & Jeslus Salas LarrazAbal, Historia general de la guerra de Espaffa (Madrid, \n1987). \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 23 \nof his war effort at several crucial moments. The basis of this view was \nFranco's dilatory decision-making style in general and his readiness, at \nBrunete and Teruel in 1937 and at the Ebro in 1938, to divert large \nnumbers of troops to the strategically meaningless and usually costly \ntask of recovering territory captured by the Republic in diversionary \nattacks. The Generalisimo's apparent propensity to lose sight of major \nstrategic goals on these occasions, together with his readiness to ignore \nseveral opportunities to conquer a poorly defended Catalonia, has led \nto the conclusion that he was lacking in vision. Certainly, it cannot be \ndenied that, as his one-time superior officer, General Jose Sanjurjo, \ncommented in 1931 'he is no Napoleon'.8 It is probably an under- \nstatement o suggest, with Hitler and Mussolini, with Kindelin and \nVig6n, that he was deficient as a military strategist. However, it is the \ncontention of this paper that to judge Franco in terms of his capacity \nto elaborate elegant and incisive strategy is to miss the point. He won \nthe Spanish Civil War in the way in which he wanted to win it and in \nthe time within which he wanted to win it. Most importantly of all, he \nderived from his victory that which he most wanted, the political power \nto remake Spain in his own image, unimpeded either by enemies on \nthe left or rivals on the right. \nIn both form and content, Franco's strategy pursued a long-term \npolitical agenda rather than immediate battlefield objectives. That this \nshould have been the case derives in part from a personality in which \ninstinctive caution coexisted with almost unlimited ambition. Even \nmore crucial was his military education and training between I907 and \n19io at the antiquated Infantry Academy in Toledo and his formative \nexperiences in Spain's savage colonial wars in Morocco. In one import- \nant respect, his personal experiences and the ethos of the Toledo \nAcademy were to come together and determine the central plank of \nFranco's military style during the Spanish Civil War. Deeply traumatised \nas a child by the infidelities of his pleasure-loving and free-thinking \nfather, he identified with his pious and conservative mother. Throughout \nhis life, he would reject all those things which he associated with his \nfather, from sexual dalliance and alcoholic drink to the ideas of the \nleft. His childhood coincided with the lowest ebb of Spain's political \nfortunes, and, over time, he came to associate his personal difficulties \nwith those of his country. In 1898, Spain suffered humiliating defeat at \nthe hands of the United States and lost the last remnants of her empire. \nWhen the fourteen-year-old Franco entered the military academy in \n1907, he found an atmosphere of fetid hostility to liberal politicians \nwho were held responsible for the imperial disaster of 1898. Throughout \n8In a conversation with the Minister of War, Manuel Azafia, on 20o July 1931- Manuel Azafia, Obras completas 4 vols (Mexico D.E, 1966-1968), IV, 35- \n24 TRANSACTIONS OFTHE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY \nhis life, he would blame his nation's disasters on men who were \nuncannily like his father.9 During the Civil War, his objective was not \nspeedy victory but the long-term eradication from Spain of such men \nand their influence. \nThe Infantry Academy taught Franco little by way of contemporary \nstrategic thinking or of technological developments in warfare since the \nFranco-Prussian war. No lessons were drawn from the guerrilla struggle \nin Cuba. The emphasis was on rigid discipline, an idealised military \nhistory of Spain's past glories and a set of moral virtues of which \nunthinking bravery and unquestioning obedience were the highest. \nSpain's current international difficulties were blamed on the poisons of \nliberalism and leftism. By way of compensation for the battlefield \nfailures of the military, great stress was placed on the army's position \nas moral and political guardian of the nation. It was axiomatic that the \narmy had the right to rise up against any government which tolerated \neither social disorder or the activities of the regional autonomy move- \nments which challenged national unity. Franco left the Academy with \nlittle applicable military science but thoroughly imbued with these \nassumptions.\"' \nIn practical terms, the formative experience for Franco the soldier \nwas as a junior officer in Spain's Moroccan protectorate. Arriving in \nMorocco in 1912, he spent ten and a half of the next fourteen years \nthere and learnt much about warfare against hostile civilians. As he \ntold the journalist Manuel Aznar in 1938, 'My years in Africa live \nwithin me with indescribable force. There was born the possibility of \nrescuing a great Spain. There was founded the idea which today \nredeems us. Without Africa, I can scarcely explain myself to myself, \nnor can I explain myself properly to my comrades in arms.\"' By dint \nof cold-blooded bravery and an assiduous attention to the detail of \nlogistics and map-making, he began his meteoric rise through the ranks \nwhich would take him from Second Lieutenant in I912 to Brigadier \nGeneral a mere fourteen years later. A war concerned with the \npacification of bitterly hostile warrior tribes could hardly have been \nmore brutal. However, the savagery of the occupying forces reached \nnew heights in August 1920 with the formation of the Spanish Foreign \nLegion or Tercio de Extranjeros, a mercenary force in which Franco would \nserve as second-in-command. As a matter of policy, the Legion would \ncommit atrocities against the Moorish villages which they attacked. \n90On the relationship between Franco's personal life and his political ideas, see Paul \nPreston, Franco: A Biography (1993), 3-9, 72. \n'\"On Franco's time at the Toledo Academy, see Preston, Franco, 8-13. \n\"'Declaraciones de S.E. a Manuel Aznar', 31 December 1938, Palabras del Caudillo 19 \nabril 1937--31 diciembre 1938 (Barcelona, 1939), 314. \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 25 \nThe decapitation of prisoners and the exhibition of severed heads as \ntrophies was common.\" Franco encouraged the brutal violence of his \nmen in the knowledge that their grim reputation was itself a useful \nweapon in terrorising the colonial population. \nBy the time that Franco returned to the Peninsula in 1926, he had \nfully developed two of the central features of his war effort during the \nthree years of Civil War-an unflinching ruthlessness in the use of \nterror against civilian populations and an unwavering belief in the \narmy's right to impose its political views. By 1936, he would also have \nacquired the conviction that he was the best person to define those \nviews. His growing belief to his own patriotic mission was confirmed \nby his period from December 1927 to June 1931 as director of the \nAcademia General Militar in Zaragoza. There, assisted by a staff \nchosen from among his Africanista comrades, he educated a generation \nof officers, who would fight by his side during the Civil War, in the \nbrutal arrogance of the Foreign Legion and the idea of the army's right \nto determine the nation's political destinies.'3 \nThe coming of the democratic Second Republic in 1931 was some- \nthing of a set-back for Franco. To his intense chagrin, the Zaragoza \nAcademy was closed and he was left for eight months without a posting \nuntil, in February 1932, he was made military governor of La Corufia. \nNeither that posting, nor his promotion one year later to be military \ncommander of the Balearic Islands, diminished his hostility to the \ndemocratic regime. His fortunes changed, however, with the coming \nto power of the increasingly conservative Radical Party backed by the \nvotes of the Catholic authoritarian party, the Confederaci6n Espafiola \nde Derechas Aut6nomas (CEDA). The Radical Minister of War, Diego \nHidalgo, not only promoted him to Major General but also chose to \nuse him as his unofficial personal adviser on military matters. In \nOctober 1934, convinced that fascism was about to be imposed in \nSpain, the workers of the northern mining districts of Asturias rose in \nprotest at the entry of the CEDA into the government. Diego Hidalgo \ninformally placed Franco in charge of the repression of the uprising. \nThe declaration of martial aw effectively transferred tothe Ministry of \nWar the responsibilities for law and order normally under the jur- \nisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. Diego Hidalgo's total reliance \non Franco effectively gave him control of the functions of both \n\"Jose Martin Blizquez, I Helped to Build an Amnny: Civil War Memoirs of a Spanish Staff \nOfficer (1939), 302; Herbert R.

It was \na profoundly formative experience, deepening his messianic onviction \nthat he was born to rule and to command Spain's armed forces in the \nbattle against the pernicious ideologies of liberalism and the left. \nDespite such inflated views of his own importance, Franco was slow \nto commit himself to the military uprising plotted in the course of the \nspring and early summer of 1936. When he finally did so, a mere five \ndays before the Civil War broke out, it was to take over the most \nefficacious units on the rebel side-the Spanish Moroccan Army. He \nfound a depressing situation when he flew into Morocco from the \nCanary Islands where he had been military commander since March. \nThe Moroccan Army was trapped on the wrong side of the Straits of \nGibraltar, blockaded by the Spanish fleet whose crews had mutinied \nagainst their right-wing officers and declared for the Republic. In \nresponse to this daunting problem, Franco displayed what were probably \nhis most valuable and inspirational qualities as a military leader--his \nglacial sangfroid under pressure, his unshakeable resolve and his infec- \ntious optimism. In speeches, harangues and broadcasts, he repeated his \ncatch-phrase 'blind faith in victory' and his mere presence with the \nrebels was a boost to their morale.'5 \nFranco's optimism and his ruthless determination to win were \nreflected in an historic interview which he gave to the American \nreporter Jay Allen in Tetuain on 27 July. Asked how long the killing \nwould continue now that the coup had failed, Franco replied 'there \ncan be no compromise, no truce. I shall go on preparing my advance \nto Madrid. I shall advance. I shall take the capital. I shall save Spain \nfrom marxism at whatever cost ... Shortly, very shortly, my troops will \nhave pacified the country and all of this will soon seem like a nightmare.' \nWhen Allen responded 'that means that you will have to shoot half \nSpain?', a smiling Franco said 'I repeat, at whatever cost.\"6 \nIn the meanwhile, he had to resolve the problem of the Republican \n'4Diego Hidalgo Durain, gPor quL fui lanzado del Ministerio de la Guerra?

He examined both the then revolutionary idea of getting his \narmy across the Straits by air and, despite advice to the contrary from \nhis staff, the bold notion of a convoy to break through the blockade.'7 \nHe believed contemptuously that the Republican sailors, without rained \nofficers to navigate, oversee the engine rooms or direct he guns, would \npresent little danger. The crossing on 5 August was an audacious risk \nwhich consolidated his standing on the Nationalist side. In the mean- \nwhile, the few aircraft at his disposal ceaselessly carried troops across \nthe Straits. This was converted into a full-scale airlift when both Hitler \nand Mussolini separately decided to help the Spanish Nationalists. \nTheir decisions to do so were ultimately determined by considerations \nof their own interests. However, that they should both decide to target \ntheir assistance on Franco was a reflection ot only of his manifest \nefficacy but also of the force of conviction with which he persuaded \nthe representatives of both Fascist Italy and the Nazi Auslandorganization \nthat he was the rebel to back. His rivals, General Emilio Mola in the \nnorth and General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano in the south could not \nmatch Franco's ability to secure foreign backing.'8 \nOnce he had his troops in Southern Spain, Franco's first operations \ndrew on his experiences in Africa. The terrain, the arid scrublands of \nAndalusia, and the fact that his opponents were poorly armed civilians, \nrecalled the colonial wars. Franco had already demonstrated his readi- \nness to use Moroccan mercenaries in mainland Spain in October 1934- \nFrom early August, his African columns set out from Seville, initially \nmaking rapid progress on the first step of a hard-fought journey to \nMadrid. With Franco's knowledge and permission, the Legion and the \nMoroccan mercenaries of the Regulares Indigenas (indigenous regulars) \nfunctioned with terrible efficacy during their advance. Franco conducted \nthe early stages of his war effort against the Spanish left as if it were a \ncolonial war against a racially contemptible enemy. The Moors and \nLegionaries pread terror wherever they went, looted the villages they \ncaptured, raped the women they found, killed their prisoners and \nsexually mutilated the corpses.'9 The use of terror, both immediate and \n'7Kindelin's on claimed that the ideas both for the airlift and for a blockade-breaking \nconvoy emanated from his father, 'Pr61ogo', Kindelin, Mis cuadernos, 45.\n'8 On Franco's role in securing Italian and German aid, see Renzo de Felice, Mussolini \nii duce: lo stato totalitario 1936-194o (Turin, 1981), 363; John F.

During, and long after \nthe Civil War, those of his enemies not physically eliminated would be \nbroken by terror and forced to seek survival in apathy. \nUnder the overall field command of Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Yagtie, \nFranco's columns advanced out of the province of Seville and into \nExtremadura. They took town after town, advancing 200 kilometres in \na little over a week. The accumulated terror generated after each minor \nvictory, together with the skill of the African Army in open scrub, \nexplains why Franco's troops were initially so successful. The scratch \nRepublican militia would fight desperately so long as they enjoyed the \ncover of buildings or trees. However, even the rumoured threat of \nbeing outflanked by the Moors would send them fleeing, abandoning \ntheir equipment as they ran. Franco planned his operations accordingly. \nIntimidation and the use of terror, euphemistically described as castigo \n(punishment), were specified in written orders.2 The most extensive \nslaughter took place in the days following the capture of Badajoz on \n14 August, when two thousand prisoners were massacred. Franco's \ndecision to turn back to Badajoz, a sixty kilometre detour for his \ncolumns, was typical of his obsession with the annihilation of all \nopposition, irrespective of the time lost or casualties incurred. If his \nforces had pressed on to Madrid, the Badajoz garrison could not \nseriously have threatened them from the rear. The decision contributed \nto the delay which allowed the Republic to organise its defences. \nJust three days earlier, on II August, Franco had written Mola a \nletter in which he revealed this obsession with the thorough purging of \ncaptured territory. It was a strategic vision which would not change \nsubstantially in the course of the war and one that was deeply imbued \nwith an essentially 'colonial' mentality. He made it clear that, for him, \nthe cumulative conquest of ground and the subsequent annihilation of \nall resistance in the 'occupied zones' meant more than rapid victory. \nNonetheless, he agreed that the ultimate objective must be the capture \nof Madrid. Significantly, noting that the fortress of the Alcazar in \nToledo was besieged by Republican militiamen, he commented that \nthe advance of his troops on the capital would 'take the pressure off \nand relieve Toledo without diverting forces which might be needed'.\" \nAfter the capture of Badajoz, the African columns advanced rapidly \nup the roads to the north east in the direction of the capital. On 27 \nAugust, they reached the last town of importance on the way to Madrid, \no\"Jose Manuel Martinez Bande, La marcha sobre Madrid (Madrid, 1968), i65-7o. \n\"Jose Manuel Martinez Bande, 'Del alzamiento a la guerra civil verano de 1936: \ncorrespondencia Franco\/Mola', Historiay uVida, \nXCIII, 1975, 22-3- \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 29 \nTalavera de la Reina, which fell one week later.\" Another savage and \nsystematic massacre ensued. The main road to Madrid was now open \nand Franco took it. However, in the light of subsequent decisions to be \ndiscussed below, there is room for speculation that Franco was not \nespecially interested in an early capture of Madrid. With resistance \nintensifying, his troops took more than fifteen days to reach the town \nof Maqueda, where the road divided to go either north-east to Madrid \nor south-east o Toledo.23 \nMaqueda fell to Yagtie on 21 September and from that moment on, \nthe nature of Franco's war altered dramatically. Earlier in the month, \nthe Republic had reorganised its government under the leadership of \nthe Socialist Francisco Largo Caballero. That move towards central \nauthority increased a feeling among the Nationalist commanders that \nthey too needed a unified command. Franco had long since expressed \nambitions in that direction, telling the Germans in Morocco that he \nwanted to be seen 'not only as the saviour of Spain but also as the \nsaviour of Europe from the spread of Communism'.24 That was not \nsomething which could be achieved by means of a swift military victory \nover the Republic and a subsequent armistice. Franco's long-term \npolitical ambitions and immediate military decisions came together in \na remarkable fashion in the immediate aftermath of Yagtie's capture of \nMaqueda. On the same day, at a meeting of the senior rebel generals \nheld at an airfield near Salamanca, Franco was elected Generalisimo \nof the Nationalist forces by his comrades-in-arms. However, behind a \nnear-unanimous vote and rhetoric of support, there was a discernible \nreluctance. Three days passed and nothing was done about publicising \nor implementing the decision to name Franco Generalisimo. Accord- \ningly, Franco sought a way of clinching their support. \nThis took the form of the strategically bizarre decision to divert his \ntroops away from Madrid towards Toledo. He thereby lost an unre- \npeatable opportunity to reach the capital while it was poorly defended \nand demoralised. Yague, Kindelin and Franco's Chief of Operations, \nLieutenant-Colonel Antonio Barroso, all warned him that a diversion \nto relieve the Alcazar would cost him Madrid. He later admitted that \n'we committed a military error and we committed it deliberately'.25 \nFranco was choosing to give a higher priority to the inflation of \nhis own political position by securing the emotional victory and \npropagandistic coup of the liberation of the Alcizar on 27 September. \n\" Martinez Bande, La marcha sobre Madrid, 45-56. \n23Martinez Bande, La marcha sobre Madrid, 56-71; Ram6n Garriga, El general Juan Yagie \n(Barcelona, 1985), 111-12. \n'4Documents onGerman Foreign Policy, D, III, 28. \n\"5 Armando Boaventura, Madrid-Moscovo de ditadura ai Repuiblica e i guerra civil de Espanha \n(Lisbon, 1937), 212. \n30 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY \nOn the following day, the Nationalist high command met again at the \nairfield near Salamanca and Franco was both confirmed atGeneralisimo \nand elected as 'Head of the Government of the Spanish State'. \nThereafter, he simply arrogated to himself the powers of the Headship \nof State.\"6 As a consequence of his decision, there was a delay between \nthe fall of Maqueda on 21 September and 7 October, when the advance \non Madrid was renewed. \nFrom the moment of his political elevation, the rhythm and style of \nFranco's war effort changed. The lightning war of the columns now gave \nway to a far more deliberate process wherein the gradual destruction of \nthe enemy took precedence over grand strategic objectives. In line with \nhis grandiose plans for permanently eradicating the left from Spain, \nFranco began to prolong the war both in order to crush his Republican \nenemies and to eliminate his rivals on the right. Visiting the ruins of \nthe Alcazar after the Civil War, Franco said to the official historian of \nhis military triumphs, Manuel Aznar, 'When I entered the Alcizar, I \nwas convinced that I had won the war. From then on it was just a \nquestion of time. I was no longer interested in a lightning victory but \nin a total victory, on every front, as a result of the exhaustion of the \nenemy.'27 \nOn 7 October, the Nationalist forces tentatively resumed operations \nagainst Madrid. After frequent consultations with Franco, Mola had \ndeveloped a two-part final strategy to take the capital which was already \nsurrounded on the west from due north to due south. The idea was \nfirst for Nationalist forces to reduce the semi-circle by closing in on the \ncapital, and then for the Army of Africa, now under the command of \nthe impetuous General Varela, to make a frontal assault through the \nnorth western suburbs. The forward efences of the city were demoral- \nised by Nationalist bombing and then brushed aside by motorised \ncolumns armed with fast Italian 'whippet' tanks.'8 However, there was \nlittle real urgency about the attack and Franco himself was curiously \nabsent from the front until 23 November when he came to order the \ncessation of the attack. He was altogether more concerned with the less \nimportant battle to relieve the Asturian capital Oviedo, for which he \nsent valuable troops from the Madrid front. However, when Barroso \nsuggested that the Nationalist forces were insufficient to justify the risks \ninvolved in attacking a city which could be defended street by street \nand house by house, Franco replied 'let Varela have a go. He has \nalways been lucky.' Such frivolity suggests that Franco was distancing \n26On the machinations behind the political elevation of Franco, see Preston, Franco, \n174-85- \n\"7Jos6 Antonio Vaca de Osma, La larga guerra de Francisco Franco (Madrid, I991), 209. \n28Martinez Bande, La marcha, 81-95. \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 31 \nhimself rom the attack on Madrid. Varela's plan to attack the northern \nsuburbs, a natural fortress girded by the River Manzanares, was suicidal. \nThere were acrimonious debates within the Nationalist high command \nover the wisdom of an uphill advance through narrow streets, yet \nFranco ultimately did nothing to prevent Varela's attack. The Gen- \neralisimo could not call off the attack on Madrid when there was \nwidespread conviction in the Nationalist ranks that the capital was \nabout to fall. However, if Varela were to fail, there could be no \nopposition to his preference for a long war.29 \nBy 22 November, the people of Madrid, assisted by the International \nBrigades, defending the city with their backs to its walls, had repulsed \nthe Nationalist attack.3\" On the following day, Franco travelled from \nSalamanca to Leganes on the outskirts of Madrid and informed his \ngenerals that there was no choice but to abandon the attack. He was \nfortunate that the Republican forces in the capital were too exhausted \nto mount an immediate counter-offensive. If they had, the tide might \nwell have turned decisively in their favour. Before the Republic could \nrally its forces, Franco's battered columns would receive massive \nreinforcements from Fascist Italy. Mussolini harboured increasing \ndoubts about the Generalisimo's strategic vision but he was already too \ncommitted to the Nationalist cause to permit Franco to be defeated.3' \nThe Germans were also 'faced with the decision either to leave Spain \nto herself or to throw in additional forces.'3 This was a situation which \nFranco would exploit with some skill. \nThe failure of the assault on Madrid left Franco indecisive in the \nface of a complex war of manoeuvre. In the judgement of General \nFaupel, 'his military training and experience do not fit him for the \ndirection of operations on their present scale.'33 Eventually, after con- \nsiderable hesitation, he moved forward from the deadlock by adopting \nan encircling strategy against the Madrid-La Corufia road to the North \nWest.1 In appalling weather, bloody battles were fought for small \nvillages.

The Republicans were now solidly dug in and Franco was \ndoubly fortunate that they were unable to launch a counter-attack to\nbreak through his severely overstretched lines and that substantial \nreinforcements would soon arrive from Italy. \nPartly out of contempt for Franco's generalship and partly out of a \ndesire to monopolise the anticipated triumph for Fascism, Mussolini \ninsisted that Italian troops must be used as an independent force \nunder an Italian general only nominally responsible to Franco's overall \ncommand. Rejecting the Duce's more ambitious plans to cut off \nCatalonia from the rest of Spain, Franco agreed to an assault on \nMalaga to provide a seaport nearer to Italy and a launching pad for \nan attack on Valencia from the south west.37 Mussolini considered that \nhe could send instructions toFranco as to a subordinate and the attack \non Malaga seems to have been his personal idea.\"8 Franco was not \nmuch interested in the Italian tactic of guerra celere (lightning war) and \nthe possibility of victories for Mussolini which might end the war before \nhis own leadership was consolidated. He visited the southern front only \nonce and was furious that Italian troops were first o enter Malaga and \nmortified by a telegram from Roatta which read 'Troops under my \ncommand have the honour to hand over the city of Malaga to \nYour Excellency'.39 In fact, given the massive numerical and logistical \nsuperiority of the attackers, the triumph was less of an achievement \nthan it seemed at the time. \nWhile the Italians attacked in the south, and heartened by the \navailability of the crack German Condor Legion, Franco had renewed \nhis efforts o take Madrid, launching on 6 February 1937 a major attack \nthrough the Jarama valley towards the Madrid-Valencia highway to \nthe east of the capital. Still convinced that he could capture the capital, \nFranco took a special interest in the Jarama campaign.40 However, \nwhen Colonel Emilio Faldella, Roatta's Chief of Staff, offered the \nGeneralisimo the opportunity to use the Italian forces to close the circle \naround Madrid, he responded negatively: 'This is a war of a special \nkind, that has to be fought with exceptional methods o that such a \nnumerous mass cannot be used all at once, but spread out over several \n35MMIS, Telegramas, 79.\n36 Carlos de Arce, Los generales deFranco (Barcelona, 1984) 186; Martinez Bande, La lucha \nen torno a Madrid, 51-69. \n37De Felice, Mussolini ilDuce, 389-90. \n38Mussolini to Roatta, 18 December 1936, MMIS, Telegramas, 69.\n39Roatta to Ufficio Spagna, 8 February 1937, MMIS, Telegramas, 130. \n40o Franco Salgado-Araujo, Mi vida, 220. \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 33 \nfronts it would be more useful.'4' He thereby revealed not just his \nresentment of the victory at Malaga, but also the narrowness of his \nown strategic vision. His preference for piecemeal actions over a wide \narea reflected both his own practical military experiences in a small- \nscale colonial war and his desire to conquer Spain slowly and so \nconsolidate his political supremacy.4' Franco would not be shaken from \nhis preference for the gradual and thorough occupation of Republican \nterritory, telling Faldella: 'In a civil war, a systematic occupation of \nterritory accompanied by the necessary purge (limpieza) is preferable to \na rapid rout of the enemy armies which leaves the country still infested \nwith enemies'.43 \nHowever, when the Nationalist attack in the Jarama was blunted by \nthe determined resistance of Republican troops reinforced by the \nInternational Brigades, Franco was forced to eat his words and beg \nFaldella for a diversion to relieve his exhausted forces. The Generalisimo \nperceived an Italian attack on Guadalajara, forty miles north-east of \nMadrid, to be an ideal way to divert Republican troops away from the \nJarama. The Italians, however, were not thinking in terms of a \nsupplementary action but rather of a bold and decisive initiative. The \nway in which Franco resolved in his own interests the contradiction \nbetween his own and the Italians' strategic onception was to reveal \nhis political ruthlessness. More significantly, it was also to underline the \nextent o which he had gained in confidence and developed his notion \nof how the war should be fought since the de6bcle at Madrid had \noccasioned the contemptuous remarks of Faupel and Roatta. \nAnxious to get the Italians to relieve the pressure on his exhausted \nforces in the Jarama, on I March, Franco agreed to Faldella's proposal \nto close the circle around Madrid, with a joint attack south west by the \nItalians from Sigiuenza towards Guadalajara backed up by a north \neastern push by Nationalist troops from the Jarama towards Alcala de \nHenares. On 8 March, the Italians under General Amerigo Coppi \ninitially broke through the Republican defences. However, it became \nclear by the evening that Franco's promised attack from the Jarama \nhad not materialised. The Republicans were thus permitted to withdraw \nforces from that front and concentrate reinforcements to the north of \nGuadalajara. The Italians were further disadvantaged by the weather. \nEquipped for African operations, they were unprepared for heavy snow \nand sleet. Their aircraft were grounded while the Republican air force \n41 Olao Conforti, Guadalajara: laprima sconfitta delfascismo (Milan, 1967), 30-2; Coverdale, \nItalian Intervention, 215. \n4'Cantalupo to Ciano, 17 February 1937, Archivio Storico del Ministero degli Affari \nEsteri, Spagna Fondo di Guerra, b.38, no.287\/137. \n43Conforti, Guadalajara, 33. \n34 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY \noperated almost normally. Their light tanks with fixed machine guns \nwere vulnerable to the Republic's Russian T-26 with revolving turret- \nmounted cannon. As Roatta desperately called for the promised sup- \nporting attack from the south, Franco feigned powerlessness. While he \nprevaricated before an apoplectic Roatta, the Italian forces were routed. \nThe defeat of Guadalajara had many components-the weather, the \npoor morale and inappropriate equipment of the Italians and the skill \nof the Republican operations. Nevertheless, if Franco's attack had taken \nplace as promised, the outcome might have been very different. The \nGeneralisimo's refusal to commit his own troops and his readiness to \nlet the Italians exhaust hemselves in a bloodbath with the Republicans \nmakes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that he had decided to use \nthe Italians as cannon fodder in his strategy of defeating the Republic \nby gradual attrition. He let the Italians bear the weight of the fighting \nwhile his own units regrouped.\"4 \nFranco could take comfort from the fact that Guadalajara was a \ndefeat which cost the Republic dearly in terms of casualties. However, \nit obliged him fundamentally to reconsider his strategic options. The \nunmistakable conclusion offered by the easy victory at Malaga and the \nbloodbaths at the Jarama and Guadalajara was that the Republic was \nconcentrating its best units around the capital and neglecting other \nfronts. Accordingly, albeit reluctantly, Franco accepted the possibility of \ndestroying the Republic by instalments far from the centre. Throughout \nMarch, Franco was subjected to pressure from Colonel Vig6n, Chief \nof Mola's General Staff, via Kindelin, and General Hugo Sperrle, \ncommander of the German Condor Legion, to intensify the war in the \nnorth in order to seize the heavy industrial resources of the Basque \nprovinces. It took Guadalajara to change Franco's mind.45 Franco made \nthe decision with uncharacteristic rapidity, persuaded by promises from \nSperrle and his Chief of Staff, Colonel Wolfram von Richthofen, about \nthe likely impact of 'close air support' in smashing the morale of \nopposing troops.46 The Condor Legion was theoretically responsible \ndirectly to Franco.\" However, given the difficulties ofhour-by-hour \nliaison, Franco gave Sperrle a free hand to deal directly with Mola and \nVig6n. Accordingly, with Franco's acquiescence, the Germans had the \n44On the battle of Guadalajara, see Preston, Franco, 229-37; MMIS, Telegrams, 161-83; \nEmilio Faldella, Venti mesi di guerra in Spagna (Florence, 1939), 255-66; Conforti, Guadalajara, \n51-178; Martinez Bande, La lucha en torno a Madrid, 133-46; Alberto Rovighi & Filippo \nStefani, La partecipazione italiana alla guerra civile spagnola (1936-I939) 4 vols (Rome, 1993) I, \n232-333. \n45Kindelan, Mis cuadernos, 120-3; General Jorge Vig6n, General Mola (el cospirador) \n(Barcelona, 1957), 303-4; Franco Salgado-Araujo, Mi vida, 225. \n46Williamson Murray, German Militay Effectiveness (Baltimore, 1992), io4-5. \n47DGFP, D, III, 125-6. \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 35 \ndecisive voice in the campaign. While the advance was being planned, \nvon Richthofen wrote in his diary, 'we are practically in charge of the \nentire business without any of the responsibility'.48 \nAlthough Franco was delighted to bask in the sensation of having \nthe Condor Legion at his orders, its novel use of ultra-modern tech- \nnology was some distance from his strategic world. Indeed, to the \nconsternation of Sperrle, he weakened the Basque offensive (Bilbao did \nnot fall until 19 June) by keeping substantial forces near Madrid and \nrequested, unsuccessfully, that the Condor Legion be split up among \nhis units in central Spain. Nevertheless, German ground attack methods, \nexemplified by atrocities uch as the bombing of undefended civilian \ntargets like Durango on 31 March and Guernica on 26 April, fitted \nwell with his notion of a war effort which would terrorise the enemy \ninto defeat. \nHe explained his thinking in this regard to the Italian Ambassador \nRoberto Cantalupo on 4 April 1937. He dismissed the idea of swift \nstrategic strikes as appropriate only for war against a foreign enemy. \nSpeaking of 'the cities and in the countryside which I have already \noccupied but which are still not redeemed', he declared ominously that \n'we must carry out the necessarily slow task of redemption and \npacification, without which the military occupation will be largely \nuseless. The moral redemption of the occupied zones will be long and \ndifficult because in Spain the roots of anarchism are old and deep.' \nRedemption meant bloody political purges such as those which had \nfollowed the capture of Badajoz and Malaga: 'I will occupy Spain town \nby town, village by village, railway by railway ... Nothing will make \nme abandon this gradual programme. It will bring me less glory but \ngreater internal peace. That being the case, this civil war could still ast \nanother year, two, perhaps three. Dear ambassador, I can assure that \nI am not interested in territory but in inhabitants. The reconquest of \nthe territory is the means, the redemption of the inhabitants the end.' \nWith a tone of helpless regret, he went on, 'I cannot shorten the war \nby even one day ... It could even be dangerous for me to reach Madrid \nwith a stylish military operation. I will take the capital not an hour \nbefore it is necessary: first I must have the certainty of being able to \nfound a regime.'49 There can be no doubting that Franco placed the \ngreatest important on the consolidation of his political power. That \nhad been shown throughout September and October 1936 and it was \n48Wolfram von Richthofen, 'Spanien-Tagebuch', in Maier, Klaus A.

His Axis allies, however, found it difficult to accept his long \nterm view of the political benefits of a plodding war of attrition. This \nled to talk of a negotiated settlement, something which the Caudillo \ndismissed out of hand-he wanted a war to the death. Nonetheless, he \nmoved with crab-like slowness and this enabled the Republican Chief \nof Staff, General Vicente Rojo, to try to halt the attack on the north \nby a diversionary attack on 6 July at the village of Brunete, in arid \nscrubland fifteen miles west of Madrid. As he was later to show at \nTeruel and the Ebro, Franco's notion of a war of moral redemption by \nterror did not permit him to give up an inch of once captured territory \nnor to turn aside from any opportunity to hammer home to Republican \nSpain the message of his invincibility-whatever the human cost. By \nresponding to the attack at Brunete, Franco delayed the far more \nimportant campaign in the north because he believed that he could \ndestroy large numbers of Republican troops on the Madrid front.5' \nFranco's decision to accept the challenge of Brunete has widely been \nconsidered a strategic error. In fact, it ensured that, in one of the \nbloodiest slogging matches of the war, the Republic, in delaying the \nfall of Santander only by about five weeks, would lose twenty thousand \nof its best troops, an objective on which Franco always placed the \nhighest value.52 More remarkable than the decision to abandon the \nnorthern campaign in order to fight at Brunete was Franco's response \nto the success of his troops. General Varela was convinced that, with \nthe Republican forces in disarray, he could take Madrid. Franco now \nhad no interest either in the early capture of Madrid nor in risking his \nadvance in the north and ordered a flabbergasted Varela to dig in.5\" \nThe collapse of Madrid would probably have ended the war. Franco, \nhowever, did not want victory until every square inch of Spain had \n50o On the process of the so-called unification of all right-wing parties under Franco, \nsee Maximiano Garcia Venero, Falange en la guerra de Espaita: la Un~fcacidn y Hedilla (Paris, \n1967) passim; Southworth, Antifalange; Preston, Franco, 248-74. \n5, Kindelan, Cuadernos, 13r-7. \n5 On the battle and its strategic significance, see Faldella, Venti mesi, 357; Vicente Rojo, \nEspafia heroica: diez bocetos de la guerra espafiola 3\"edici6n (Barcelona, 1975) 91-ioI; Thomas, \nThe Spanish Civil War, 710-16. \n53Kindelin, Mis cuadernos, 136-7; Manuel Aznar, Historia militar de la guerra de Espafia \n(Madrid, 1940), 46o; Jose Ignacio Luca de Tena, Mis amigos muertos (Barcelona, 1971), \n205-6; Vaca de Osma, La larga guerra, 294-7. \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 37 \nbeen cleansed of leftists and liberals. \nThe campaign in the north became something of a walk-over. On \n24 August 1937, two days before the fall of Santander, Rojo launched \nanother diversionary offensive along a broad front westwards from \nCatalonia aimed at encircling Zaragoza. The small town of Belchite \nfell and Franco gave long consideration to a response. However, given \nthe low strategic value of the ground lost and the likely impact on both \nNationalist and Republican morale of delaying the attack on Asturias, \nthis time he did not take the bait.54 Belchite hardly interrupted the \nNationalist conquest of Asturias during September and October. In \nterms of control of industrial production and population, the balance \nof power had now shifted dramatically in the Generalisimo's favour. \nHis lines shortened and his commitments diminished, Franco now had \npowerful and well-equipped army available for use in the centre and \nthe east. \nAfter nearly two months reorganising his forces into six army corps, \nFranco hesitated over the direction of his next great offensive. After \nlengthy consideration of a great push through Arag6n and then either \nan attack on Valencia or else a sweep through Catalonia to cut off the \nRepublic from the French frontier, he decided, in early December, to \nlaunch his next attack against Madrid.55 He hoped to complete the \nencirclement of the capital with a push towards Alcala de Henares. \nHowever, Rojo pre-empted the operation by another diversionary \noffensive on 15 December against the bleak city of Teruel in Arag6n. \nThe Republican forces quickly captured one thousand square kilometres \nand, for the first time, entered an enemy-held provincial capital.\"6 \nFranco abandoned his Guadalajara offensive despite the firm, not to \nsay frantic, advice of his own staff and of the senior German and \nItalian officers to abandon Teruel. His goal of the total, humiliating \nannihilation of the Republic did not admit of allowing the enemy such \nsuccesses. With Rojo having thrown everything into the Teruel offensive, \nthe capture of Madrid was a realistic possibility but Franco was not \ninclined to end the war before he had thoroughly 'redeemed' more \nterritory. In that sense, the attraction of confronting Rojo at Teruel \nwas that it provided the opportunity to destroy a large body of the \nRepublic's best forces.57 \n54Rojo, Espaila heroica, 103-15; Servicio Hist6rico Militar (CoronelJos6 Manuel Martinez \nBande), La gran ofensiva sobre Zaragoza (Madrid, 1973), 78-167; Aznar, Historia militar, 499- \n516; Thomas, Civil War, 722-8; Franco Salgado-Araujo, Mi vida, 241-2. \n55Jos6 Manuel Martinez Bande, La batalla de Teruel 2\" edici6n (Madrid, 1990), 16-26. \n56Rojo, Espaiia heroica, 117-125; Jos6 Manuel Martinez Bande, La batalla de Teruel \n(Madrid, 1990), 52-64; Aznar, Historia militar, 543-54. \n57Claude Martin, Franco soldado y estadista (Madrid, 1965), 293; Aznar, Historia militar, \n551, 622; Garriga, Yagrie, 139-40. \n38 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY \nWhen Franco pulled troops towards Teruel, an outraged Ciano \ncommented 'Our generals are restless, quite rightly. Franco has no idea \nof synthesis in war. His operations are those of a magnificent battalion \ncommander. His objective is always ground, never the enemy. And he \ndoesn't realise that it is by the destruction of the enemy that you win \na war'.58 Ciano was wrong. Franco's obsession with 'ground' was a \ndeliberate quest for great battles of attrition which could, and did, \ndestroy vast numbers of the enemy's troops. Teruel would be just such \na conflict. Conducted in freezing conditions and at enormous cost to \nboth sides, the battle was eventually won by Franco's forces on 22 \nFebruary.59 The Republican army was shattered and the Nationalists \nwere now poised to sweep through Arag6n at their leisure. Franco now \nhad a twenty per cent advantage in terms of men and an overwhelming \none in terms of aircraft, artillery and other equipment.6 The destruction \nof the best Republican units at Teruel made it the military turning \npoint of the Civil War. The battle also coincided with a further step \nforward in the institutionalisation of Franco's political power, with the \nformation of his first government on 30 January 1938.6' \nThe triumph at Teruel opened up vistas of uninterrupted victories \nagainst an exhausted Republic and, over the next five months, Franco \nmade good use of his opportunities. His concern with the physical \nannihilation of the enemy precluded stylish strategic operations to finish \noff the Republic quickly. Nevertheless, he was now to show some skill \nin handling a large army of several hundreds of thousands of men \nacross a huge front and should therefore be seen as more than the \npetty-minded battalion commander so often derided by Hitler and \nFaupel, Mussolini and Ciano. In early March, six army corps totalling \n200,000 men began an advance across a 260 kilometre wide front in \nthe direction of the Ebro valley. The objective was to destroy more \nRepublican forces and to reach the point where the River Segre, which \nran north to south through eastern Catalonia, met the Ebro running \nwest to east near LUrida. So spectacular was its success that, by 15 \nMarch, Franco decided to push on to the sea and cut off Catalonia \nfrom Valencia and the central Republican zone. \nHowever, when LUrida fell on 4 April to Yagie, he along with \nKindelmn, Vig6n \nand the new commander of the Condor Legion, \nGeneral Hellmuth Volkmann, advocated the occupation of a badly \n\" Ciano, Diary 37-38, 46. \n59 Martinez Bande, Teruel, 165-209; Lojendio, Operaciones militares, 380-95; Aznar, Historia \nmilitar, 569-85; Salas Larrazibal, Ejircito, II, 1672-1704. \n6\"DGFP, \nD, III, 556-7; Gerald Howson, Aircraft ofthe Spanish Civil War 1936-1939 (1990), \n20-8. \na' The Times, 4 March 1938; DGFP, D, III, 613-14; Ram6n Serrano Sufier, Entre Hendaya \ny Gibraltar (Madrid, I947), 60-4. \nFRANCO AS MILITARY LEADER 39 \ndefended Catalonia. It seemed to be the moment to finish off the \nRepublic.\"' If he had followed all this advice, Franco could probably \nhave brought the war to a speedier conclusion. There were no significant \nRepublican forces between Ikrida and Barcelona. The loss of Catalonia, \nwith the Republic's remaining war industry and the seat of government, \nwould be a devastating blow to Republican morale. Franco rejected \nsuch a move partly because of fears of French intervention on behalf \nof the Republic.' However, he seems to have been motivated rather \nmore by concern than a sudden Republican collapse in the wake of \nthe fall of Barcelona would still have left a substantial number of armed \nRepublicans in central and southern Spain. His goal remained the total \nannihilation of the Republic and its supporters. Accordingly, to the \nastonishment of Rojo as well as of Yagtie, Kindeln and Vig6n, he \ndecided to divert his troops south for an attack on Valencia. He \nwanted further destruction a d demoralisation of the Republic's human \nresources before the war was over.64 \nAfter eaching the Mediterranean on 15 April 1938, Franco's forces \nset off on a slow and bloody advance towards Valencia through the \ndifficult terrain of the Maestrazgo. Kindelhn begged Franco to desist \nfrom an operation which was incurring high casualties for the National- \nists as well as for the Republicans but he refused.65 By 23 July 1938, \nhowever, his forces were less than forty kilometres from Valencia. In \nan attempt to restore contact between Catalonia and the rest of the \nRepublican zone, a desperate diversionary assault across the River \nEbro was launched by General Rojo on 24 July. With the advantage \nof surprise, by I August, the Republicans had advanced forty kilometres \nto Gandesa. Although his staff were dismayed by the Ebro crossing, \nFranco himself welcomed the opportunity to encircle the Republicans \nwith their backs to the river. He poured troops into the area and began \na merciless four-month battle of attrition in order, at no little cost in \nNationalist lives, to smash the Republican forces. Valencia was aban- \ndoned and a strategically meaningless battle which would involve a \nbloodbath worse even than those of the Jarama, Brunete and Teruel. \nBut Franco thought the losses a reasonable price to pay for the \nannihilation of the Republican army.66 \n62Kindelan, Mis cuadernos, 157-63; DGFP, D, III, 628. \n63Jaime Martinez Parrilla, La fuerzas armadas francesas ante la guerra civil espaidola (1936- \ni939) (Madrid, 1987), 184-92; David Wingeate Pike, Les franfais et la guerre d'Espagne 1936- \n1939 (Paris, 1975), 296-7; DGFP, D, III, 620-2. \n64Josb Manuel Martinez Bande, La ofensiva sobre Valencia (Madrid, 1977), 16-18; Garriga, \nYague, 145-6; Vicente Rojo, iAlerta los pueblos! estudio politico-militar del periodo final de la guerra \nespaflola 2a edici6n (Barcelona, 1974), 40, 46-50, 54-5- \n65 Martinez Bande, La ofensiva, 69-96. \n66 Franco Salgado-Araujo, Mi vida, 264; Aznar, Historia militar, 739-70. \n40 TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL HISTORICAL SOCIETY \nOnce more, his own staff and his German and Italian advisers were \ndismayed. They pointed out to him that it would be easy to contain \nthe Republican advance and attack a now virtually undefended Bar- \ncelona.67 He was not interested, much preferring to convert Gandesa \ninto the cemetery of the Republican army than to seek a swift and \nimaginative victory.\" The cost was horrendous on both sides. It was \nnot until the end of October, after he had secured substantial supplies \nof German weaponry in return for mining concessions, that Franco \ncould launch his decisive counter-offensive. By mid-November, he had \nrecovered the territory lost in July. He had side-stepped another chance \nof quick victory and secured what he most wanted-the annihilation \nof the Republican army. There would be no negotiated truces, no \nconditions, no peace with honour. It was effectively the end for the \nRepublic. The last push against Catalonia began on 23 December. \nBarcelona fell on 26 January 1939. In Madrid, on 4 March, the \ncommander of the Republican Army of the Centre, Colonel Seg- \nismundo Casado revolted against the Republican government in the \nhope of stopping increasingly senseless slaughter. His hopes of a \nnegotiated peace were rebuffed by Franco and, after a minor civil war \nwithin the civil war, troops all along the line began to surrender. The \nNationalists entered an eerily silent Madrid on 27 March. On I April \n1939, Franco issued his final victory communique. \nFranco had fought a political war. He had not set out to emulate \nNapoleon. Indeed, he stated often enough his conviction that 'stylish \nmilitary operations' did not serve his purpose. He was almost certainly \nlacking in the vision and the capacity to conceive such operations. His \ntalents lay in other directions. He had a remarkable capacity to raise \nthe morale of those around him simply by his imperturbability under \npressure. No reverse affected his equanimity. His ability as a rebel \ngeneral to secure the logistical support of Germany and Italy was \ncrucial to the success of his war effort. His success in domesticating \nand unifying the disparate political forces in his coalition was hardly \nless remarkable. These were achievements which outweighed his \ndeficiencies as a stylish strategist. In the last resort, his primordial \nconcern as a military leader had been to ensure a long future as \ndictator, and his war effort successfully traumatised the defeated into \nlong years of apathy. Many of Franco's strategic decisions-Toledo, \nBrunete, Teruel, the Maestrazgo, the Ebro-confirm that he was not \na great military thinker. Yet each of those decisions brought him nearer \nto his goal. He can hardly be considered a military failure. His strategy \n67Kindelin, Mis cuadernos, 173. \n68Manuel Tagtefia Lacorte, Testimonio de dos guerras (Mexico D.

His \nwar effort was the first and bloodiest stage in a political repression that \nwould maintain an intense rhythm of killing until 1943 and never be \nentirely relaxed. Throughout the years following his victory, he rejected \nany thought of amnesty or reconciliation with the defeated. Over four \nhundred thousand Republicans were forced into exile. As many again \nwere sentenced to periods in prison, concentration camps or labour \nbattalions. Until he died, Franco's regime deliberately kept alive the \nmemory of the Civil War and maintained the division between victors \nand vanquished as an instrument of policy.69 His long war was the \npillar on which his long dictatorship rested. \n69Paul Preston, The Politics of Revenge: Fascism and the Militagy in Twentieth Centugy Spain \n(I990), 30-47. \n"}
