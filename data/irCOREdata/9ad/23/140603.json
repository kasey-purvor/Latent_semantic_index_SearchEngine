The work comprised a series of bench 12 \nscale flotation trials treating three commonly encountered algal species (Microcystis, Melosira and 13 \nChlorella) that were removed in a flotation cell configured as either: conventional dissolved air 14 \nflotation (DAF); ballasted flotation using low density 70 micron glass beads with a density of 100 15 \nkg.m-3; or a hybrid process of ballasted flotation combined with conventional DAF. Results 16 \nindicated that the bead only system was capable of achieving better residual turbidity than 17 \nstandard DAF at bead concentrations of 500 mg.L-1. Addition of beads in combination with 18 \nstandard DAF reduced turbidity further to even lower residual turbidity levels. Algae removal was 19 \nimproved when glass beads were dosed, but removal was dependent on algal species. Microcystis 20 \nwas removed by 97% for bead only systems and this removal did not change significantly with the 21 \naddition of air bubbles. Melosira was the next best removed algae with bead only dosed systems 22 \ngiving similar removals to that achieved by standard DAF using a 10% air recycle ratio (81 and 23 \n76% removal respectively).  Chlorella was the least well removed algae by bead only systems 24 \n(63% removal). However, removal was rapidly improved to 86% by the addition of air bubbles 25 \nusing only a 2% recycle ratio. Energy estimations suggested that at least a 50% energy reduction 26 \ncould be achieved using the process offering a potential route for future development of low 27 \nenergy separation processes for algae removal.  28 \n 29 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 2\nKeywords: Algae, Bubbleless, Dissolved air flotation, Energy,  30 \n 31 \nIntroduction 32 \nDissolved air flotation (DAF) is an established solid-liquid separation technology process 33 \nin water treatment for removal of low density floc including those containing algae or 34 \ndominated by natural organic matter (NOM) and in low temperature countries (Schofield, 35 \n2001). In the DAF process, floc formed in preceding coagulation and flocculation stages 36 \nare separated from water by the attachment of bubbles onto the floc. The bubble-floc 37 \naggregate becomes less dense than water and therefore floats to the top in a flotation tank 38 \nforming a sludge blanket. Clarified water exits the tank from beneath the float, whilst the 39 \nsludge blanket is periodically removed from the top. A key component in any DAF 40 \nsystem is the generation of micro-bubbles by saturating air with water. During saturation, 41 \nbetween 5-15% of the clarified flow is recycled and mixed with air supplied by a 42 \ncompressor. The air-water mixture is then pressurised to between 400-650 kPa to 43 \ndissolve the air into the water. The pressurised air-water mix is then introduced into the 44 \nflotation tank at atmospheric pressure through nozzles. As a result of the release of the 45 \npressure drop, the excess air precipitates out in the form of bubbles that are typically 46 \nbetween 40-100 \u03bcm (AWWA, 1997). A benefit of the system is in its ability to adjust to 47 \nwater quality and solid concentration changes by altering the number of bubbles released 48 \nby changing the recycle ratio enabling changes in the particle loading to be effectively 49 \nmatched by addition of more or less air bubbles.  50 \nAs well as being a large capital cost, the saturator and recycling systems account for 51 \napproximately 50% of the operating costs of a DAF system (Haarhoff and Rykaart, 52 \n1995). This is principally from the electrical energy consumption of around 0.3 kWh.m-3 53 \nof treated water for the operation of the compressor of the saturator and the pumping of 54 \nthe recycling system (Viitasaari et al., 1995). Consequently significant saving could be 55 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 3\nmade if the need for bubble generation could be removed. A bubbleless system may be 56 \nachieved using the concept of ballasted flotation. In ballasted flotation, a low density 57 \nmaterial is incorporated into the floc to give the aggregate an overall density less than 58 \nthat of water so that the particle floats without the need for bubbles to be attached. Low 59 \ndensity materials that could be used include a range of commercially available hollow 60 \nspheres composed of latex or glass or solid particles that float in water (composed of a 61 \nmaterial such as polystyrene). This concept is described in two patents: WO\/2006\/008474 62 \nand US Patent 6890431 but there is no other published research on the process. Analogy 63 \nof the ballasted flotation concept can be made with sedimentation systems where floc 64 \ndensities are increased by adding ballasting agents of high density. Examples of 65 \nballasting agents include activated carbon, recycled sludge (Landon et al., 2006), 66 \nmagnetic particles (Booker et al., 1996) and sand (Plum et al. 1998). The latter is perhaps 67 \nthe most commonly adopted version under the trade name Actiflo\u00ae and is used for a 68 \nrange of applications including tertiary treatment of sewage, intermittent discharges and 69 \npotable water treatment (Guibelin et al., 1994; Imasuen et al., 2004). Similarly, the 70 \nadvantage of using a low density ballasting agent could have the equivalent effect of 71 \nenhancing flotation (in combination with bubbles) or replacing the need for bubbles 72 \nentirely resulting in a significant energy reduction for the flotation process. Ballasted 73 \nflotation could be used in all applications where standard DAF is currently used, such as 74 \ntreatment of waters that are dominated by algae or NOM. The work presented here 75 \ninvestigates the practical feasibility of ballasted flotation by examining the efficacy of 76 \nimplementing recyclable low density beads to replace the bubbles used in DAF in bench 77 \nscale jar test trials for removal of particles from water spiked with algae.  78 \n 79 \nMaterials and Methods 80 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 4\nA series of bench scale jar tests was carried out to determine the feasibility of using low 81 \ndensity glass beads for flotation of floc dominated by algae. Tests were carried out in one 82 \nof two formats: 1) Traditional DAF and 2) Ballasted flotation. 83 \nTraditional DAF: Jar tests were carried out using a model DBT6 DAF batch jar tester 84 \n(EC Engineering, Canada). The DAF jar tester operates in a similar way to a standard jar 85 \ntester during the floc formation stage using 1 L samples of water contained in 1 L square 86 \nbeakers. Water was rapid mixed for 1 minute at 200 rpm followed by a slow stir period at 87 \n30 rpm for 15 minutes. For flotation of floc, the DAF jar tester adds pressurised water 88 \nsaturated with air into the jar through diffusers enabling bubbles to form that can attach to 89 \nthe flocs and float them to the surface of the jar. The amount of air saturated water added 90 \ninto the jar was varied from 0-10% of the 1 L sample in the jar (referred to as the recycle 91 \nratio). The 0% recycle ratio represented a sedimentation system because no air bubbles 92 \nwere dosed into the system to enable flotation to take place. Water was sampled from a 93 \nsampling tap a third of the way up the jar after 10 minutes of flotation. For each jar test, 94 \nsamples were analysed for turbidity using a Hach 2100 turbidimeter after 10 minutes of 95 \nflotation following the addition of air bubbles into the jar tester.  96 \n 97 \nThe water tested was from a lowland reservoir from the east of the UK. The water had a 98 \nturbidity of 6.5 \u00b1 1.7 NTU. Water was coagulated using ferric sulphate (Ferripol XL, EA 99 \nWest) at a dose of 3.5 mg.L-1 as Fe at pH 5.5 (a pre-determined optimum for this water). 100 \nInitial testing was carried out on the raw water. Subsequent tests to determine the 101 \neffectiveness of low density beads on algae removal were carried out by separately 102 \nspiking raw waters with three different algae species: Microcystis (cyanobacteria); 103 \nMelosira (diatomaceous algae); Chlorella (green algae). Algae were cultured in nutrient 104 \nrich Jaworski medium in sterile beakers at 15 \u25cbC in a continuous light environment. The 105 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 5\nwater was spiked with algae to simulate bloom concentrations at between 0.5-1.0 x 106 106 \ncells.L-1. Algae were enumerated using a Neubauer hemocytometer before and after 107 \nflotation. The number of fields of view required to count 100 individual algal cells for a 108 \nspecific magnification was measured and equated to the volume of water contained in the 109 \nhemocytometer for each field of view.  110 \nBallasted flotation: Low density glass beads from Trelleborg, Emerson and Cuming Inc 111 \n(Mansfield, USA) were used in flotation tests as provided by the manufacturer. 112 \nManufacturer information reported the beads having a median size of 70 \u03bcm and a 113 \ndensity of 100 kg.m-3. The beads were dosed into the water before the coagulant was 114 \nadded and mixed briefly to disperse in the jar at concentrations between 100-900 mg.L-1. 115 \nThe jar test was then carried out as described before for recycle ratios between 0-10%. In 116 \nthis case the 0% recycle ratio was a flotation test because the beads in the floc reduced 117 \nthe density of the aggregate to below that of the water. To determine whether the beads 118 \ncould be effectively re-used after coagulation, the bead-floc float was broken up by 119 \nrapidly mixing on the jar tester to separate the two at 200 rpm for 1 minute. The mixing 120 \nwas stopped and the beads that floated to the top of the jar after 10 minutes were 121 \ncollected and re-used in a subsequent jar test using the previously described coagulation 122 \nprocedure. This was repeated five times. 123 \nThe particle size distribution (PSD) of the beads used in this work was validated using a 124 \nMalvern Mastersizer (Malvern Instruments, UK). Beads were added into 1 L of de-125 \nionised (DI) water in a 1 L square beaker at a concentration of 300 mg.L-1. The beads 126 \nwere mixed on a jar tester at 200 rpm and pumped through the optical unit of the 127 \nMastersizer and back into the jar. An average of three measurements was used to provide 128 \nthe final PSD. The size of the flocs formed on the jar tester with and without glass bead 129 \naddition were also measured using the Mastersizer instrument. The suspension was 130 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 6\nmonitored by drawing water through the optical unit of the Mastersizer and back into the 131 \njar by a peristaltic pump on the return tube using 5 mm internal diameter peristaltic pump 132 \ntubing at a flow rate of 1.5 L.hr-1. Size measurements were taken every minute for the 133 \nduration of the jar test and logged onto a PC.  134 \nModelling floc sedimentation and rise rates was carried out using Stokes\u2019 law. There is 135 \nsome uncertainty in using Stokes\u2019 law for flocs due to their porous and irregular structure 136 \nbut the application provides a useful relative comparison and is widespread in floc 137 \nanalysis (Bache et al., 1991; Gregory, 1997; Tang et al., 2002). In this analysis, floc were 138 \nassumed to be spheres consisting of i) flocculated matter (algae and coagulant 139 \nprecipitates) and ii) glass beads with a diameter of 70 \u03bcm. The density of the flocculated 140 \nmatter was modelled between 1010-1060 kg.m-3. These density ranges were selected 141 \nbased on literature values for different types of floc (1038-1065 kg.m3 for activated 142 \nsludge flocs (Sears et al., 2006); ferric hydroxide floc density estimated 1050 kg.m-3 143 \n(Bastamante et al., 2001); algae floc modelled as 1020 kg.m-3 (Haarhoff and Edzwald, 144 \n2001)). Glass bead density was taken as 100 kg.m-3 from manufacturer data.  145 \nResults  146 \nThe performance of the system was dependent on both the bead concentration and the 147 \nequivalent recycle ratio applied (Figure 1). In the case of traditional DAF, the residual 148 \nturbidity ranged from 1.7 to 4.2 NTU as the recycle ratio decreased from 10 to 2% (0 149 \nmg\/L bead concentration, Figure 1). Addition of beads to the system resulted in either no 150 \nchange or a slight decrease in turbidity except at high bead doses and low recycle ratios 151 \n(Figure 1). For instance, at a recycle ratio of 6% the residual turbidity with no beads was 152 \n2.6 NTU and ranged between 1.4 and 2.9 NTU for bead concentration between 100 and 153 \n900 mg.L-1. For ballasted flotation, the application of beads without the use of any 154 \nbubbles (0% recycle ratio) resulted in residual turbidities between 2.4 NTU at 600 mg.L-1 155 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 7\nand 5 NTU at 200 mg.L-1 indicating that the use of beads and no bubbles approached the 156 \nperformance of traditional DAF (Figure 1). Closer inspection of the residual water 157 \nrevealed beads remained in the water which reflected a distribution of properties 158 \nobserved in the beads and the fact that no pre-conditioning was conducted. This 159 \nobservation was confirmed by recovering the floated beads and reusing them on 160 \nconsecutive application (Figure 2). After the first use of the beads at 500 mg.L-1, the 161 \nresidual turbidity was 3.5 NTU, this was reduced to 1 NTU after the fifth use of the same 162 \nbeads. This was below that achieved for a system at 10% recycle ratio without any beads 163 \nadded (1.7 NTU) showing that the beads could be effectively recycled and that, in fact, 164 \nthe bead system was capable of working better than traditional DAF after the beads had 165 \nbeen used three times or more. A 41 % improvement in residual turbidity was observed 166 \nusing the bubbleless bead system (ballasted flotation, 0% recycle) compared to traditional 167 \nDAF after five uses of the bead (Figure 2). The observed improvement with multiple uses 168 \nreflects the removal of non floating beads due to imperfections in manufacture that lead 169 \nto thicker walls of the spheres than intended, increasing the density of the beads. In 170 \naddition, breakage of the spheres can also occur. Manufacturer data indicated that 1% of 171 \nthe beads by volume may be expected to be failures that do not float. Given that glass 172 \ntypically has a density of 2,200 kg.m-3 or above (Koike and Tomozawa, 2007), non-173 \nfloating beads will have a significant impact on overall floc density. However, removal of 174 \nsuch beads during a pre-conditioning process effectively negates the problem. In this 175 \ncase, pre-conditioning was achieved through the multiple re-use of the same beads and 176 \nresulted in a system that generated a lower residual turbidity than traditional DAF.    177 \nComparison of the efficacy of the ballasted flotation in relation to differing algal species 178 \nindicated a small difference in performance depending on the specific species tested. The 179 \nbubbleless bead process (0% recycle) was seen to be most effective for flotation of the 180 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 8\nalgae Microcystis resulting in 97% removal. Removal did not change significantly with 181 \nthe addition of bubbles, fluctuating between 92 and 96%. Conversely, for systems with 182 \nno beads added, removal increased from 16 to 78% removal with increasing recycle ratio 183 \nfrom 0 to 10 %. Melosira was the next easiest algae to remove increasing from 81% 184 \nremoval to 96% with increasing recycle ratio for systems with bead dosing. Of note, it 185 \nwas evident that removal of Melosira for a bead dosed system and no air bubbles resulted 186 \nin slightly better removal than for no beads at 10% recycle ratio with values of 81 and 187 \n76% respectively. Chlorella was the most poorly removed algae when no bubbles were 188 \nadded for bead dosed systems at 63% removal, however the addition of a small number 189 \nof bubbles (2% recycle ratio) increased removal up to 86%. This removal was 190 \nsignificantly above the level seen for non-bead dosed systems at the highest recycle ratio 191 \nof 10% which produced 70% removal. 192 \nThe range of algae removal observed during traditional DAF operation was in a similar 193 \nrange to that seen previously in operational DAF systems of between 80-98% (Markham 194 \net al., 1997). The differences in removal for different algae reflects the differences in 195 \nstructure between species. All of the algae floc showed poor removal when clarification 196 \nwas by sedimentation. This was particularly the case for Chlorella and Microcystis which 197 \nwere only removed by <20% in a sedimentation system. Both of these algae exist as 198 \nsmall single celled spheres between 2-10 \u03bcm (Henderson et al., 2008). Melosira is a 199 \ndiatom that forms much larger long chain colonies. Diatoms also contain silica in their 200 \ncell walls which has a high density (2200 kg.m-3). The combined effect of increased size 201 \nand density explains why Melosira was the best removed algae by sedimentation. 202 \nRegardless of this, algae flocs were much better removed by flotation processes, a 203 \nconclusion reached by other researchers (Teixeira and Rosa, 2006). Microcystis, a 204 \ncyanobacteria, is a very low density algae because it has a gas vacuole within the cell 205 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 9\nstructure which enables the algae to control its buoyancy in the water column. This 206 \nmakes removal of floc containing Microcystis particularly amenable to removal by 207 \nflotation. However, for conventional DAF, these algae floc were poorly removed until 6-208 \n10% recycle ratios. With glass beads, Microcystis floc were very well removed by 209 \nflotation without the need for any bubbles (0% recycle). For the algae without a vacuole 210 \n(Melosira and Chlorella), the very highest removals were seen involving a combination 211 \nof low density beads and air bubbles. This indicates that a combined effect of algae 212 \nstructure, morphology and density has a significant impact on removal efficiency by 213 \ncoagulation and clarification, a conclusion that is in agreement with numerous other 214 \nstudies on particle flotation (Valade et al., 1996; Henderson et al., 2008). 215 \nThe presence of beads in the algae coagulation systems aided the removal of algae for all 216 \nof the recycle ratios investigated and the different algae species. In addition to improved 217 \nflotation, the presence of small spheres may have increased the incorporation of algae 218 \ninto the floc that resulted in fewer non-flocculated algae in the jar test. A high 219 \nconcentration of small particles provides nucleation points for coagulant precipitates to 220 \nform around and encourage floc development and can promote enmeshment of algae 221 \nwithin the floc matrix. The addition of kaolinite and activated silica has been added for 222 \nthis purpose to improve natural organic matter removal (Gregor et al., 1997). 223 \nThe average size of the floc for systems dosed with and without glass beads was 224 \nsignificantly different for the two systems (Figure 4a and b). Non-bead dosed systems 225 \ngrew to a median floc size of 600 \u03bcm, reaching this size after 7 minutes of the jar test. 226 \nFor systems dosed with beads, the flocs grew to a size that reached a maximum of 260 227 \n\u03bcm after 4 minutes of the jar test, but stabilised at 185 \u03bcm. As can be seen in the inset 228 \nimage in Figure 4, numerous beads were observed to be incorporated into the algae-229 \ncoagulant floc with over 25 beads in the floc with a diameter of 500 \u03bcm. Given that the 230 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 10\nmaximum floc size was reached significantly before the end of the 15 minute flocculation 231 \ntime for both systems in the jar test experiments, shorter flocculation times are advocated. 232 \nThis is in agreement with other research suggesting that flocculation periods of 5-10 233 \nminutes are recommended for DAF (Edzwald, 1995). 234 \nThe reduced floc size observed was an indication of reduced floc strength for floc 235 \ncontaining beads given that the steady state floc size has been shown to be an indicator of 236 \nfloc strength (Yukselen and Gregory, 2004; Jarvis et al., 2006). However, although there 237 \nwas a difference in the average floc size for systems with and without beads added, it 238 \nshould be noted that in conventional DAF, floc are exposed to high energy when they are 239 \nmixed with bubbles which breaks up the floc. The shear rates in DAF have been 240 \nestimated to be between 1000-7600 s-1 (Masschelein, 1992; Fukishi et al., 1995). It has 241 \nbeen shown that the maximum floc size at shear rates of 1000 s-1 were between 30-281 242 \n\u03bcm which were formed from floc sizes of 600-1200 \u03bcm at 10 s-1 showing that floc size 243 \nwas significantly reduced under the conditions prevalent in DAF (Bache and Rasool, 244 \n2001). Flocs formed in a bead dosed system and separated with no air bubbles added 245 \nwould not be broken up because they would not be exposed to these high shear rates, 246 \nenabling floc to maintain their size as formed in the flocculator. The importance of this 247 \nrelates to the breakage products formed, which includes the formation of floc around 1 248 \n\u03bcm in diameter. These sized particles cause significant operational problems because 249 \nthey are poorly removed in downstream filtration processes. Limiting exposure of flocs to 250 \nhigh shear rates in flotation, as well as in the preceding coagulation and flocculation 251 \nstage, is particularly important for systems containing algae that may release toxins (such 252 \nas Microcystis) under high shear stresses (Edzwald and Wingler, 1990). The proposed 253 \nballasted flocculation process would eliminate the need for the high shear rates used 254 \ntoday in most operational DAF plants.  255 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 11\nOne consequence of dosing glass beads into the system will be an initial increase in 256 \nsludge volume. However, because the beads will be removed from the sludge and re-257 \nused, the volumes of sludge to be treated and disposed of will be the same as that for a 258 \nconventional DAF system. 259 \nThe use of rise velocity modelling to establish the sensitivity with which bead properties 260 \ninfluenced performance indicated that the density of the coagulated material had little 261 \nimpact on settling and rise rates at the mean floc size observed in the current study of 262 \naround 200 \u03bcm (Figure 5a). The theoretical settling rate of the flocs with no beads varied 263 \nfrom 0.08 m.h-1 and 0.47 m.h-1 for the lowest and highest floc densities used. A floc 264 \ncontaining 10 beads had a theoretical rise velocity of 2.8-3.0 m.h-1 with around 43% of 265 \nthe total floc volume contributed from the bead. A floc containing 20 beads had a rise 266 \nvelocity of 6.0-6.1 m.h-1 but would only contain 15% floc matter whilst above 23 beads, 267 \nthe volume of the beads would exceed the volume of the complete 200 \u03bcm floc. As a 268 \ncomparison to these modelled values, rise velocities for bubble-floc aggregates have been 269 \nmeasured as 3 m.h-1 for ferric hydroxide-algae floc (Vlaski et al., 1997) for floc with an 270 \naverage size of 15-20 \u03bcm. The rise velocities of activated sludge flocs were captured 271 \nbetween 1.8 and 37.8 m.h-1 with two thirds of the flocs measured having rise rates 272 \nbetween 5 and 15 m.h-1 (Ljunggren et al., 2004).  273 \nThe simple calculations have demonstrated that it is possible for floc containing beads to 274 \nhave rise velocities similar to the range observed in other studies. Given the similar or 275 \nbetter turbidity removals observed for ballasted flotation (with no bubbles) when 276 \ncompared with conventional DAF, it would be expected that the performance observed in 277 \njar tests would be translated to continuous systems. The key is to ensure that enough 278 \nbeads are incorporated into the floc to enable high rates of flotation and promote the 279 \nformation of large floc. For a 200 \u03bcm floc, the average floc size seen in this work, this 280 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 12\nwould require between 10-20 beads to be contained in the floc structure. If larger floc can 281 \nbe formed and maintained it would be possible to generate flocs with theoretical rise rates 282 \nof >40 m.h-1 for floc >500 \u03bcm containing over 300 glass beads (Figure 5b). 283 \n 284 \nDiscussion 285 \nThis bench-scale study has shown that using floating beads potentially offers an 286 \nalternative means of separating floc from treated water giving similar levels of residual 287 \nturbidity to conventional flotation systems with air bubbles. In principle, any coagulated 288 \nmaterial (algae, activated sludge, NOM or minerals) could be floated from the system so 289 \nlong as enough beads are incorporated into the floc aggregate to significantly reduce the 290 \ndensity of the floc below that of the water. A conceptual flow diagram of a how a 291 \nballasted flotation system may be implemented at full scale shows the replacement of the 292 \nsaturator with a hydrocylone to recover beads and two additional pumps to transport 293 \neither recycled or fresh beads into the flocculation tanks (Figure 6). The reduction in 294 \nenergy usage by removing the need for the saturator has two benefits: a direct saving in 295 \nmoney and a reduction in carbon footprint. Evaluation of the impact of such a system 296 \nrequires accurate information about the energy usage of individual components within 297 \nwater works which is currently not commonly available. Estimates for the energy used 298 \nfor the saturation system of a typical DAF plant range between 0.1 and 0.3 kWh.m-3 299 \n(Viitasari et al., 1995) and this compares to around 0.003-0.02 kWh.m-3 for a typical 300 \nhydrocylone (Vion, 2000). Even after the inclusion of pumps, the ballasted flotation 301 \nprocess should still enable at least a 50% reduction in energy to be generated when 302 \ncompared with traditional DAF. To illustrate the potential impact of this, the energy 303 \nsaving at a standard water treatment works operating at 50 Ml.d-1 would be 1,825,000 304 \nkWh.year-1 if it switched from traditional DAF to the ballasted flotation process 305 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 13\n(assuming a saturator operating at 0.2 kWh.m-3 and a 50% energy reduction when using 306 \nfloating beads with hydrocyclones and additional pumping). This equates to 196 307 \ntCO2e.year or an annual cost saving of \u00a3127,750.  308 \nThe current study was focussed on evaluating the potential of utilising beads to ballast a 309 \nflotation process at bench scale. The positive results presented then raise questions about 310 \nits implementation, most importantly: (1) what is the risk of beads entering the final 311 \nwater and (2) how effectively can the beads be recycled and at what loss rate. The 312 \npresented work provides some evidence towards the first question: First use of the beads 313 \nresulted in high numbers of residual beads but subsequent use reduced this number 314 \nsignificantly demonstrating that appropriate pre-conditioning is essential and effectively 315 \nremoves the problem. Further, given the bead size of 100 \u03bcm, any beads carried over 316 \nwith the clarified water will be captured within the downstream filtration processes 317 \n(Henderson et al., 2008). Consequently, the possibility of bead carryover into the product 318 \nwater is very low. The second question remains crucial. Whilst batch recovery of the 319 \nbeads through high speed mixing within a jar tester worked effectively, translation into a 320 \ncontinuous process is important as the energy required to operate the plant and the bead 321 \nloss rate will define the overall economics of the process. In addition, whilst it is not 322 \nexpected, further work is required to clearly demonstrate that ballasted flotation will not 323 \nincrease cell lysis and increase the release of algogenic organic material, particularly in 324 \nrelation to toxic compounds from Cyanobacteria. However, these results have 325 \ndemonstrated that the ballasted flotation process appears to be very effective technology 326 \nfor algae removal and could have much wider application in water, wastewater and 327 \nindustrial solid-liquid separation processes. 328 \n 329 \nConclusions 330 \nM\nAN\nUS\nCR\nIP\nT\n \nAC\nCE\nPT\nED\nARTICLE IN PRESS\n 14\nApplication of low density glass beads as a flotation ballasting agent effectively removes 331 \nthe need for dissolved air in the flotation process. In the case of algae the efficacy of the 332 \nballasting agent was related to the characteristics of the algae and was most effective for 333 \nMicrocystis species. Floc diagnostics revealed that ballasted flocs were smaller than those 334 \nformed during the coagulation of algae. However, in practice these floc will not be 335 \nexposed to the higher shear rates of traditional DAF because of the removal of the 336 \ndissolved air injection stage. Floc breakage is therefore minimised, ensuring that the 337 \nconcentration of residual turbidity in the clarified water is low and composed of larger 338 \nfloc that will be more amenable to removal by filtration. Overall the use of beads 339 \nprovides a low energy alternative to traditional DAF which can meet or exceed 340 \nperformance and provide in-process and downstream benefits through extended filter run 341 \ntimes.  342 \n 343 \nReferences 344 \nBache, D.
