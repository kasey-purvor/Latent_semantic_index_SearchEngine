INTRODUCTION \n \nWith the advent of the Internet, the purchasing and \ndistribution of satellite images can be now performed on-\nline with relative ease. With this ease come the problem of \ncopyright protection and the proof of rightful ownership of \nsatellite images. The prevention of illegal distribution of \ndigital multimedia content on the Internet and other media \nhas led to recent interest and research into the field of \ndigital watermarking [1, 2] and digital rights management \n(DRM).  \n  \nThis paper presents a novel digital watermarking algorithm \nusing an image as a watermark to be hidden in an original \nimage. Satellite images with various complexities will be \nused to illustrate the robustness of the algorithm against \nvarious image attacks. Although some artifacts can be \nvisualized from the retrieved watermark after the attacks, \nthe overall structure of the watermark remained intact and \nis still recognizable. This paper will provide different \nwatermarking attack examples on satellite images and \ndiscusses the performance tradeoffs in terms of data \nintegrity and algorithm robustness. \n \nDigital watermarking is essentially a subset of \nsteganography. Steganography is a Greek word meaning \n\u201chidden writing\u201d or \u201ccovered writing\u201d. Many digital \nwatermarking techniques adopt similar technologies used \nin transform coding and communication theory [2]. \nHowever, many of these techniques can only embed or \nhide a limited number of bits or characters in the original \ndata. In this paper, a novel image-in-image watermarking \ntechnique known as StegMark developed by DataMark \nTechnologies [3] was applied to various satellite images. \nStegMark allows an image watermark, such as a \ncompany\u2019s logo to be embedded inside the satellite \nimages, while maintaining the data integrity and \nrobustness of the watermark.  \n \nFigure 1 illustrates how StegMark performs the digital \nwatermarking process. Once the watermark, w, has been \nembedded inside the original image, a hash or key file is \ncreated. The hash file is used to retrieve the hidden \nwatermark and will be distributed to and kept by the \nrightful owner. It will be used in a legal dispute to identify \nthe true ownership of the data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1 illustrates the digital watermarking process \n \nUsing StegMark, three satellite images with various \ncomplexities, taken from SPOT and Landsat of pixel size \n512 x 512 were embedded with the same image \nwatermarks. Figure 2 illustrates the original and \nwatermarked images. An image watermark with the \ncharacter \u201cDMT\u201d of pixe l size 100 x 40 was used for the \nembedding. The PSNR of the three watermarked images \nwere 89.82 dB and 84.79 dB for the SPOT Hongkong and \nSea images and 94.38 dB for the Landsat image, \nrespectively.  \n \nDigital \nWatermarking\nAlgorithm \nMarked \nImage \nW Key \nImage \n \n0-7803-7033-3\/01\/$10.00 (C) 2001 IEEE\n0-7803-7031-7\/01\/$10.00 (C) 2001 IEEE 11940-7803-7031-7\/01\/$17.0  (C) 20 1 IE\n2. WATERMARK ROBUSTNESS  \n \nThere are many different watermarking techniques \ncommercially available and from various research \ninstitutions [1] based on bit and character embedding. \nHowever, many of these algorithms can be easily attacked \nand have their watermarks removed from the original \nimage. Image attacks such as contrast stretching, flipping, \nformat conversion can be used relatively easily to remove \nthe watermark. To measure the effectiveness of a \nwatermarking technique in terms of its robustness and data \nintegrity criteria, an image manipulation tool called \nStirmark is commonly used to perform the performance \nbenchmarking [1]. Stirmark consists of around 90 different \ntypes of image attacks that include rotation, scaling and \nfiltering.  Figure 3 demonstrates the robustness of \nStegMark against the various attacks such as 20% \ncropping, rotation by 0.25\u00b0 and JPEG compression with a \nfactor of 50. \n \n     SPOT HK Image               SPOT HK Watermarked                   \n                                                  \n \n      Landsat Image            Landsat Watermarked \n                     \n \n     SPOT Sea Image               SPOT Sea Watermarked \n                                        \n \nFigure 2 illustrates the original and watermarked satellite \nimages of various complexities. \n \nFrom figure 3, the image watermark with characters \n\u201cDMT\u201d clearly survived various attacks from Stirmark. \nAlthough, the recovered watermarks were contaminated \nwith various artifacts, however; the main advantage of the \nStegMark watermarking technique is its ability to exploit \nour own powerful visual system (our eyes) to recognize the \nstructure of the images. Conventional watermarking \ntechniques typically use some form of confidence level \nbased on a pre-determined threshold to check whether the \nwatermark characters or bits are the same after image \nattacks. The results basically provide either a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d \nanswer.  \n \nFor these techniques using bits or characters-based, the \nbinary 1 or 0 can be modified quite easily to become 0 or 1 \nunder attacks. For example, an ID string \u201cABC\u201d as a \nwatermark can be retrieved as \u201cBBC\u201d after certain type of \nattacks. Character \u201cA\u201d can be represented in ASCII by a \ndecimal value 65 and \u201cB\u201d by 66. The decimal values are \nonly different by 1. The question remains on the \nrobustness of watermarking algorithms under various \nforms of image manipulations. Using the Stirmark \nbenchmark test, the novel StegMark watermarking \nalgorithm achieved a success rate of approximately 89% \nfor the 90 different image attacks.  \n \n3. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  \n \nThis paper described a novel image-in-image \nwatermarking algorithm for copyright protection of \nsatellite images. Two SPOT and one Landsat images with \nvarious complexities were used for the investigation. \nUsing Stirmark, which is a standard benchmarking tool to \nattack watermarks, the StegMark algorithm was able to \nachieve close to 89% success rate against more than 90 \nimage manipulations or attacks that included format \nconversion, rotation, contrast stretching, scaling and \nfiltering. The PSNR was used to compare the original and \nthe watermarked satellite images and the results ranged \nfrom approximately 85dB to 95 dB. \n \nAs the watermark is a 2-D image, it is planned that some \npost-processing such as image restoration and correlation \ncan be used to further enhance the watermark recognition \nprocess and therefore increase the success rate against \ndifferent types of image attacks. Another area that we are \ncurrently investigating is the ability to perform digital \nwatermarking for printed materials. For example, if the \nsatellite image has been developed as a photograph or \nprinted, can we still retrieve the watermark? \n \n \n \n \n \n0-7803-7033-3\/01\/$10.00 (C) 2001 IEEE\n11950-7803-7031-7\/01\/$17.00 (C) 2001 IEEE\n4.
