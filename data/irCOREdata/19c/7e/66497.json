Precession of an off-centred vortex in a dimple trap, embedded\nin a weaker harmonic trap, leads to the emission of sound in a dipolar radiation pattern. Sound\nemission and reabsorption can be controlled by varying the depth of the dimple. In a shallow\ndimple, the power emitted is proportional to the vortex acceleration squared over the precession\nfrequency, whereas for a deep dimple, periodic sound reabsorption stabilises the vortex against\nradiation-induced decay.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.Lm, 67.40.Vs, 47.32.Cc\nThe superfluid nature of weakly-interacting atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) supports quantized\ncirculation, as observed in the form of single vortices [1],\nvortex lattices [2], and vortex rings [3]. Vortices are fun-\ndamental to the understanding of fluid dynamics, sig-\nnalling the breakdown of ordered flow and the onset of\nturbulence. Dilute atomic gases enable easy control and\nobservation of quantized vortices, complimenting vortex\nstudies in liquid Helium, superconductors, and non-linear\noptics. Vortices in superfluids are subject to both ther-\nmal and dynamical instabilities. Thermal dissipation in\nBECs induces an outward motion of the vortex towards\nlower densities [4]. Dynamical dissipation is evident in\nsuperfluids in the limit of low temperature, as manifested\nin the temperature-independent crystallisation of vortex\nlattices in BEC\u2019s [5], and the decay of vortex tangles in\nliquid Helium [6]. In this limit, reconnections and Kelvin\nwave excitations of vortex lines leads to dissipation by\nsound (phonon) emission [7, 8]. Superfluid vortices are\nalso unstable to acceleration, in analogy to Larmor radia-\ntion induced in accelerating charges. For example, coro-\ntating pairs [9], and single vortices performing circular\nmotion [7, 10], within a two-dimensional (2D) homoge-\nneous superfluid are predicted to decay via sound emis-\nsion. However, this decay mechanism is not expected to\noccur in finite-sized BECs due to the sound wavelength\nbeing larger than the system size [10, 11].\nIn this Letter we show that a vortex in a trapped quasi-\n2D BEC, precessing due to the inhomogeneous back-\nground density, emits dipolar sound waves in a spiral\nwave pattern. The quasi-2D geometry ensures that the\nvortex line is effectively rectilinear and that Kelvin wave\nexcitations [12, 13] are negligible. This instability is\nclosely analogous to the decay of dark solitons in quasi-\n1D BECs via sound emission due to longitudinal confine-\nment [14, 15] . Quasi-2D \u2018pancake\u2019 BECs have recently\nbeen created experimentally, using tight confinement in\none dimension [16, 17]. Although such systems are prone\nto strong phase fluctuations, these effects are suppressed\nin the limit of very low temperature [18, 19]. In a har-\nmonic trap sound reabsorption occurs, stabilising the vor-\ntex (in the absence of other decay mechanisms), while, in\nmodified trap geometries, sound reabsorption can be pre-\nvented for times long enough to enable the vortex decay\nto be observed and probed. In the latter case, the power\nradiated by the vortex is found to be proportional to the\nvortex acceleration squared and inversely proportional to\nthe precession frequency.\nOur analysis is based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\n(GPE) describing the mean-field dynamics of a weakly-\ninteracting BEC in the limit of low temperature,\ni~\n\u2202\u03c8\n\u2202t\n= \u2212 ~\n2\n2m\n\u22072\u03c8 + Vext\u03c8 + g|\u03c8|2\u03c8 \u2212 \u00b5\u03c8. (1)\nHere \u03c8 is the macroscopic order parameter of the sys-\ntem, m the atomic mass, and \u00b5 = ng is the chemical\npotential, where n is the atomic density. The atomic\nscattering amplitude g = 4pi~2a\/m, where a is the s-wave\nscattering length, is taken to be positive, i.e. repulsive in-\nteratomic interactions. The external confining potential\nVext is given by,\nVext = V0\n[\n1\u2212 exp\n(\n\u2212 2r\n2\nw02\n)]\n+\n1\n2\nm\u03c92\nr\nr2+\n1\n2\nm\u03c92\nz\nz2, (2)\n0  x0   \n0\n0.5\n1\nn\n (n\n0)\nx\n0\n0.5\n1\nV \n(\u00b5)\n(a)\n(b)\nFIG. 1: (a) Isosurface plot of the atomic density (n = 0.1n0,\nwhere n0 is the peak density) of a quasi-2D BEC, confined\nby the potential of Eq.

This con-\nfiguration can be realised experimentally by focussing\na far-off-resonant red-detuned laser beam in the cen-\ntre of a magnetic trap. Close to the centre, the gaus-\nsian dimple is approximately harmonic with frequency\n\u03c9d = 2\n\u221a\nV0\/w0. For trap parameters, \u03c9r = 2pi \u00d7 5 Hz,\n\u03c9d = 20\u03c9r, and \u03c9z = 200\u03c9r (we choose \u03c9z \u226b \u03c9r to\nsuppress excitation in the z direction), the harmonic os-\ncillator time is \u03c9\u22121\nd\n= 1.6 ms. In this case, the timescale\nof dynamical instability due to sound emission is much\nshorter than the expected thermodynamic vortex life-\ntime, which is of the order of seconds [4]. Assuming a\npeak density n0 = 10\n14 cm\u22123 and a chemical potential\n\u00b5 = 3.5~\u03c9d, a\n87Rb (23Na) BEC has harmonic oscilla-\ntor length ld =\n\u221a\n~\/(m\u03c9d) = 1.1(2.1) \u00b5m, and healing\nlength \u03be = ~\/\n\u221a\nm\u00b5 = 0.53ld.\nA singly-quantized vortex, initially at position (x0, y0)\nin the dimple (illustrated in Fig. 1) is expected to pre-\ncess around the trap centre, along a path of constant\npotential, as observed experimentally [20]. This can be\ninterpreted in terms of the Magnus force induced by the\ndensity gradient [21, 22]. However, the acceleration of the\nvortex produces sound emission. By varying the depth\nof the dimple we show how this emission can be observed\nand quantified. Analogous control has previously been\ndemonstrated for dark solitons [15].\nThe energy of a precessing vortex, for both deep V0 \u226b\n\u00b5 and shallow V0 < \u00b5 dimples, is shown in Fig. 2(a). The\nvortex energy is monitored by integrating the GP energy\nfunctional,\nE = \u2212 ~\n2\n2m\n|\u2207\u03c8|2 + Vext\u03c82 + g\n2\n|\u03c8|4, (3)\nacross a \u2018vortex region\u2019, defined to be a circle of radius 5\u03be\ncentred on the core, and subtracting off the correspond-\ning contribution of the background fluid. Although the\nvortex energy technically extends up to the boundary of\nthe system, this region contains\u223c 50% of the total vortex\nenergy at all background densities considered here.\nFor \u03c9z \u226b \u03c9r and providing lz \u226b a, where lz is\nthe transverse harmonic oscillator length, the GPE can\nbe reduced to a 2D form with a modified coefficient\ng2D = g\/(\n\u221a\n2pilz) [18, 23]. In Fig. 2(a) we compare the\nfull 3D GPE (black lines) with the computationally less\ndemanding 2D GPE (grey lines), where the 2D and 3D\ndensity profiles are matched as closely as possible. The\nexcellent agreement justifies the use of the 2D GPE for\nsubsequent results.\nFor a deep dimple, the emitted sound waves are con-\nfined to the dimple region and reinteract with the vor-\ntex, and there is no net decay of the vortex energy. The\nenergy oscillations correspond to a beating between the\nvortex mode and the collective excitations of the trapped\ncondensate. The beating effect is illustrated in Fig. 2(b),\nwhere we plot the Fourier transform of the vortex x-\ncoordinate (dotted line) and energy (solid line).

Similar beating effects are observed for a\ndriven vortex [24], and between a dark soliton and the\ndipole mode in a quasi-1D BEC [15]. In contrast, for a\nshallow dimple, V0 < \u00b5, the radiated sound escapes, and\nthe vortex energy decays monotonically (dashed line in\nFig. 2(a)).\nIn an experiment, the vortex energy can be extracted\nby measuring its position. The trajectory of the vortex\nfor both deep (solid line) and shallow (dashed) dimples\nis shown in Fig. 3. For V0 \u226b \u00b5, the orbit is essentially\nclosed, with the vortex remaining in the effectively har-\nmonic region of the dimple, but features a small modula-\ntion due to the interaction with the collective excitations\nof the background fluid. In stark contrast, for V0 < \u00b5, the\nvortex spirals out to lower densities. A similar outward\nmotion has recently been predicted for a vortex precess-\ning in a harmonic trap modulated by an optical lattice\n[25]. The results presented here are for a homogeneous\nouter region \u03c9r = 0. Simulations for \u03c9r 6= 0 are essen-\ntially indistinguishable up to a time when the sound re-\nflects off the condensate edge and returns to the dimple.\nFor example, for an outer trap \u03c9r = \u03c9d\/20, the emitted\nsound begins to reinteract with the vortex at t \u223c 80\u03c9d.\nFollowing this interaction with the reflected sound, the\nvortex decay is slowed down, but not fully stabilised, due\nto a dephasing of the sound modes in the outer trap.\nWeakly anisotropic 2D geometries yield the same qual-\nitative results, with vortex precession now occuring in\nan ellipse, rather than a circle. In the limit of strong\nanisotropy, deviations arise as the system tends towards\nthe quasi-1D regime, where vortices are not supported.\nThe continuous emission of sound waves during the\nprecessional motion is evident by a close inspection of the\nsurrounding density distribution during the course of the\ndecay (Fig. 3, insets). The waves are emitted perpendicu-\nlarly to the instantaneous direction of motion in the form\nof a dipolar radiation pattern, while the spiralling mo-\n3\u22123 \u22121.5 0 1.5 3\nx (ld)\n\u22123\n\u22121.5\n0\n1.5\n3\ny \n(l d) (i)\n(ii)\n(i) (ii)\nFIG. 3: Path of a vortex, initially at (0.53, 0)ld.

The wavelength\nof the emitted sound \u03bb \u223c 25ld agrees well with the the-\noretical prediction of \u03bb \u223c 2pic\/\u03c9v = 21.3ld [11], where\nc =\n\u221a\n\u00b5\/m is the speed of sound and \u03c9v is the vortex\nprecession frequency.\nThe power radiated by the vortex, in the limit of\nno reinteraction with the emitted sound (V0 = 0.6\u00b5, is\nshown in Fig. 4, as a function of time and radius from the\ntrap centre. Due to contraints on the size of our compu-\ntational grid, this plot was mapped out by a few simula-\ntions, with the vortex being started progressively further\nfrom the trap centre. This could also be implemented ex-\nperimentally in order to trace out the vortex decay. The\ncurve can be understood qualitatively by considering the\ndensity inhomogeneity that the spiralling vortex experi-\nences: the emitted power increases in line with the local\nradial density gradient up to r \u2248 1.4\u03be, where the gradi-\nent of the gaussian potential is a maximum, and subse-\nquently tails off as the trap gradient decreases smoothly\nto zero. We have additionally considered the case where\nthe dimple is harmonic instead of gaussian, and find the\nsame qualitative results, but with enhanced power emis-\nsion for a particular \u03c9d, due to the larger precession fre-\nquency (see Fig. 5, inset).\nA 2D homogeneous superfluid can be mapped on\nto a (2+1)D electrodynamic system, with vortices and\nphonons playing the role of charges and photons respec-\ntively [27]. By analogy to the Larmor radiation for an\naccelerating charge and the power emitted from an ac-\ncelerating dark soliton in a quasi-1D BEC [15], we as-\nsume the power radiated P by the spiralling vortex to be\nproportional to the square of the local vortex accelera-\ntion a. The coefficient of this relation, P\/a2, has been\nmapped out over a range of dimple strengths, as shown\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\nr (ld)\n0 100 200 300\nt (\u03c9d\u22121)\n0\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\n0.1\nP \n(h\u03c9\nd2\n\/2\npi\n)\nFIG. 4: Power radiated as a function of radius from the trap\ncentre (top axis) and time (bottom axis), as calculated from\nthe GP energy functional (solid line).

Each data point corresponds to the best-fit\npower coefficient and the average vortex precession fre-\nquency for that simulation. In a harmonic trap of fre-\nquency \u03c9, the vortex precession frequency is predicted\nto be \u03c9v = (3~\u03c9\n2\/4\u00b5)ln(R\/\u03be), where R =\n\u221a\n2\u00b5\/m\u03c92 is\nthe Thomas-Fermi radius of the BEC [22]. For a har-\nmonic trap with a cut-off (V = V0 for r > r0), the vor-\ntex frequency (Fig. 5 inset, crosses) agrees well with this\nprediction. However, for a gaussian dimple of depth V0,\n\u03c9v falls short of this prediction, due to the tailing off of\nthe gaussian potential with radius, as shown in Fig. 5\n(inset, circles). Note that there are limitations to the\nrange of precession frequencies that we can probe, just as\nwould be experienced experimentally: in the limit of very\ntight dimples the vortex escapes almost instantaneously,\nwhereas for very weak dimples, the vortex motion is too\nslow for such effects to be systematically studied. The\ndata indicates a strong dependence on the inverse of the\n\u03c9v, suggesting a modified power law of the form\nP = \u03b2mn0\u03be\n2\na2\n\u03c9v\n, (4)\nwhere \u03b2 is a dimensionless coefficient. An equation of\nthis form for circular vortex motion in a homogeneous\n2D fluid has been obtained by Vinen [7] using classical\nacoustics and Lundh et al. [10] by mapping the superfluid\nhydrodynamic equations onto Maxwell\u2019s electrodynamic\nequations. Both approaches predict a rate of sound emis-\nsion proportional to \u03c93\nv\nr2\nv\n, where rv is the precession\nradius, and yield a coefficient, \u03b2 = pi2\/2. Despite the\nassumptions of perfect circular motion, a point vortex,\nand an infinite homogeneous system, there is remarkable\nagreement with our findings which indicate \u03b2 \u223c 6.3\u00b10.9\n(one standard deviation), with the variation due to a\nweak dependence on the geometry of the system. We\nbelieve that the deviation from the predicted coefficient\narises primarily due to the radial component of the vortex\nmotion, which is ignored in the analytical derivations.\nAlso plotted in Fig. 4, alongside the power emission\nfrom the GP energy functional, are an acceleration-\nsquared law (dotted line) and the modifed acceleration\n40 0.4 0.8 1.2\n\u03c9d (\u03c9d0)\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n\u03c9\nv \n(\u03c9\nd0\n)\n0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25\n\u03c9V (\u03c9d0)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nP\/\na2\n \n(m\n\/\u03c9\nd0\n)\nFIG. 5: Coefficient of an acceleration squared power law,\nP\/a2, for a vortex, calculated over a variety of trap strengths\n\u03c9d, as a function of \u03c9v (circles), along with the analytical pre-\ndictions [7, 10] (dashed line), and best fit line corresponding\nto Eq.

(4) (dashed line), with the coefficients\nbeing chosen to give a best fit. Both lines give excellent\nagreement until the vortex starts to escape the dimple\nregion at r \u223c 1.4ld. Here the vortex frequency, which\npreviously remained roughly constant, starts to decrease\ndue to the form of the local density. This causes the\nacceleration-squared law to deviate significantly, while\nthe 1\/\u03c9v term in Eq. (4) corrects for this deviation, giv-\ning excellent agreement throughout the decay.\nSound radiation due to acceleration may be important\nin the case of turbulent vortex tangles in liquid Helium,\nwhere evidence suggests that the vortex line length L\n(providing a measure of the energy of the system) de-\ncays at a rate proportional to L2 [7]. In the limit of low\ntemperature, this decay is believed to be primarily due\nto reconnections and Kelvin wave excitations. We note\nthat, for a system of many vortices, where the acceler-\nation is induced by the surrounding vortex distribution,\nEq. (4) would also lead to an L2 decay.\nIn summary, we have shown that a vortex precessing\nin a trapped quasi-2D BEC at low temperature emits\ndipolar radiation, which becomes modified into a spiral\nwave pattern due to the motion of the vortex. The vor-\ntex energy decays at a rate proportional to its accelera-\ntion squared and inversely proportional to the precession\nfrequency. For appropriate trap geometries, the sound\nemission is experimentally observable via the spiralling\nmotion of the vortex towards lower densities. An analo-\ngous instability may arise in the case of optical vortices,\nwhich also exhibit a fluid-like motion [28]. For harmonic\ntraps the vortex decay is stabilised by reinteraction with\nthe emitted sound.\n[1] M. R. Matthews et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83, 2498 (1999).\n[2] J. R. Abo-Shaeer, C. Raman, J. M.
