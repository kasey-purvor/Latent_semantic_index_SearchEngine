By adopting two different approaches, we obtain conditions for the origin\nto be a global attractor which is approached (a) non-monotonically and (b) monotonically.\nIn case (b), we obtain an asymptotic expression for the convergence to the origin. Some\nfurther numerical results are reported.\nKeywords: Global attractivity, parametric forcing, asymptotics.\nShort title: Parametrically-driven ODEs\n1 Introduction\nIn this paper we consider the behaviour of the following nonlinear, parametrically driven ODE\nd2x\ndt2\n+ \u03b3\ndx\ndt\n+ f(t)x2m+1 = 0 (1.1)\nwhere \u03b3 > 0, m \u2208 Z+ and f(t) > 0 is bounded above and below for all t \u2265 0. This differential\nequation arises as a simple model of a nonlinear electronic circuit known as a parametric\namplifier [1], in which f(t) is the signal to be amplified, and x(t) is the output of the circuit.\nWe denote the upper and lower bounds of f(t) as f+ and f\u2212 respectively. Equation (1.1) can\nbe re-written as a pair of coupled, first-order differential equations as\nx\u02d9 = y\ny\u02d9 = \u2212\u03b3y \u2212 f(t)x2m+1 (1.2)\nwhere (x, y) \u2208 R2 and a dot placed above a variable indicates differentiation with respect to\ntime. We refer to the differential equation in this form as the \u2018original system\u2019.\nIt is well known that the phase space structure of time-dependent dynamical systems is\nin general very intricate: there are systems possessing bounded periodic and non-periodic\n1\nsolutions, quasi-periodic solutions and unbounded non-periodic solutions of oscillatory type\nwith any prescribed number of zeros, see for example the papers by V.M. Alekseev [2].\nThere exist some results on a large class of time-dependent potentials in the undamped case.\nFor example, it has been proved that for superquadratic potentials which are parametrically\ndriven by a positive time-periodic function, as in (1.1) when \u03b3 = 0 and f(t+ T0) = f(t), all\nthe solutions are bounded for all time and in fact most of the motion is quasiperiodic [3, 4].\nMoreover the search for periodic solutions in time-dependent dynamical systems has proven\nvery fruitful by using a number of techniques such as the calculus of variations [5] and the\nPoincare\u00b4-Birkhoff theorem [6, 7, 8].\nSome work has also been done on the classification of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions\nof nonlinear differential equations; see [9] and references therein.\nAnother natural question one may ask is: do there exist time-dependent potentials such\nthat all the solutions of the corresponding differential equations are bounded in phase space?\nThe answer is naturally of fundamental importance for the stability properties of dynamical\nsystems and there currently exists a substantial body of work on this problem in the zero-\ndamping case [10]\u2013[15]. The essential idea used to show boundedness of solutions for these\npotentials is to transform the system, by a sequence of canonical transformations, into a\nnear-integrable one, and then to apply KAM theory and the Moser twist theorem.\nIt is not difficult to prove that a certain amount of damping guarantees boundedness of\nsolutions of equation (1.1), but we go further in this paper, and derive conditions under\nwhich the origin is a global attractor. We also derive a further bound on the damping which\nforces all solutions to decay to the origin in a non-oscillatory way.\nThe system (1.2) has just one fixed point, namely the origin, (x, y) = (0, 0). The eigenvalues\nof the linearised system at the origin are 0 and \u2212\u03b3, so that the origin is marginally stable as a\nsolution of the linearised system. Our aim is to establish sufficient conditions for the origin to\nbe a global attractor, i.e., for all initial values (x(0), y(0)) \u2208 R2, limt\u2192\u221e(x(t), y(t)) = (0, 0).\nWith zero as an eigenvalue of the linearised problem, even the local stability of the origin is\nnot determined by the linearised equations and thus the problem of the global attractivity is\na particularly delicate one. This paper will establish the global attractivity of the origin for\nsufficiently large \u03b3 > 0, and also a condition on \u03b3 which guarantees that the convergence is\nmonotone.\n2 Global attractivity of the origin\n2.1 Oscillatory decay\nWe use the following transformation, which is due to Liouville:\n\u03c4 = G(t) =\n\u222b t\n0\n\u221a\nf(s)ds.\nSince f(t) > 0 and bounded above for all t, G(t) is a monotonically increasing function of t\nand G\u22121 exists. Introducing F (\u03c4) := f(t) = f(G\u22121(\u03c4)), equation (1.1) is transformed into\nthe system\nx\u2032 = y\n2\ny\u2032 = \u2212 y\u221a\nF\n(\nF \u2032\n2\n\u221a\nF\n+ \u03b3\n)\n\u2212 x2m+1 (2.1)\nwhere prime denotes differentiation with respect to \u03c4 . Defining the Hamiltonian, H(x, y), as\nH = x2m+2\/(2m+ 2) + y2\/2 gives\nH \u2032 = \u2212 y\n2\n\u221a\nF\n(\nF \u2032\n2\n\u221a\nF\n+ \u03b3\n)\n. (2.2)\nHence, provided\n\u03b3 > \u2212min\n\u03c4\u22650\n(\nF \u2032(\u03c4)\n2\n\u221a\nF (\u03c4)\n)\n= \u2212min\nt\u22650\n(\nf\u02d9(t)\n2f(t)\n)\n(2.3)\nwe have H \u2032(\u03c4) \u2264 0 so that x and y are both bounded. Also, for all \u03c4 \u2265 0,\nH(\u03c4) +\n\u222b \u03c4\n0\ny2(s)\u221a\nF (s)\n(\nF \u2032(s)\n2\n\u221a\nF (s)\n+ \u03b3\n)\nds = H(0).\nLetting \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e and using (2.3), and also the boundedness above and below of F (\u03c4), we\nconclude that\nmin\ns\u22650\n{\n1\u221a\nF (s)\n(\nF \u2032(s)\n2\n\u221a\nF (s)\n+ \u03b3\n)}\u222b \u221e\n0\ny2(s) ds <\u221e.\nTherefore, y \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e (and hence also as t \u2192 \u221e). We shall now revert to the\nsystem in the form (1.2) to show that x \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. Let k > 0 be arbitrary and\nU = {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : H(x, y) < k}. Let S = {(x, y) \u2208 U : H\u02d9 = 0} and let M denote the\nlargest invariant set in S. Then, by the La Salle\u2019s invariance principle [16, Theorem 9.22],\nevery solution of (1.2) that starts in U has its \u03c9-limit set in M . In this case, S consists of\npoints with y = 0 and, from (1.2), it follows immediately that M consists solely of the origin.\nSince k > 0 was arbitrary, we may now state:\nProposition 1 Let \u03b3 satisfy (2.3). Then all solutions of (1.2) satisfy (x(t), y(t)) \u2192 (0, 0) as\nt\u2192\u221e.\n2.2 Non-oscillatory decay\nThis section aims to discover further conditions on \u03b3 and on the initial conditions which will\nguarantee that convergence of solutions of (1.2) to the origin is monotone.\nIt will be advantageous to introduce the new state variables u(t) and v(t) defined by\nu = x\u22122m, v = u\u02d9. (2.4)\nThe main result of this section follows by a careful analysis of the various regions of the (u, v)\nphase plane, and this analysis is carried out below.\nWith u = x\u22122m, we have on differentiating\nx\u02d9 = \u2212x\n2m+1\n2m\nu\u02d9 and x\u00a8 =\nx2m+1\n2m\n[\n(2m+ 1)\n2m\nu\u02d92\nu\n\u2212 u\u00a8\n]\n.\n3\nSubstituting these into (1.1) and defining u\u02d9 = v gives\nu\u02d9 = v\nv\u02d9 = 2mf(t)\u2212 \u03b3v + (2m+ 1)\n2m\nv2\nu\n(2.5)\nwhich we refer to as the transformed system. In the transformed system, u(t) > 0, since u =\nx\u22122m, but v(t) may be of either sign. We therefore need to conduct a thorough investigation\nof the right half u > 0 of the (u, v) phase plane. Note that the transformed system (2.5)\ncannot have any fixed points. First, we have\nProposition 2 Let the hypotheses of Proposition 1 hold. Then, trajectories of (2.5) must\nenter the open first quadrant in finite time, and then remain there.\nProof. It is trivial to see that the open first quadrant is positively invariant and so we simply\nneed to address the fate of a trajectory that starts in the fourth quadrant, i.e., has v(0) < 0.\nSince, by Proposition 1, x and y are bounded, any crossing of the v-axis is impossible so\nu(t) > 0 is bounded below for all t. Also\nv\u02d9 = 2mf(t)\u2212 \u03b3v + (2m+ 1)\n2m\nv2\nu\n\u2265 2mf\u2212 \u2212 \u03b3v. (2.6)\nBy a standard comparison argument, we conclude that v(t) becomes positive in finite time.\nThe proof is complete.\nIn the light of the above Proposition, it is sufficient to consider trajectories that start in the\nopen first quadrant and thus we may assume from now on that u(t), v(t) > 0 for all t \u2265 0.\nThe next proposition is important. Of course, our transformation u = x\u22122m clearly requires\nx 6= 0. It is implicitly assumed at the outset that the convergence of x(t) and y(t) to zero (the\nmain result we are aiming for) is a non-oscillatory convergence, i.e., either x(t) > 0 for all\nt \u2265 0, or x(t) < 0 for all t \u2265 0. As we might expect physically, this will be the case only if the\ndamping parameter \u03b3 is sufficiently large (see Proposition 3 below). We address this point\nbelow by giving conditions on \u03b3, and on the initial conditions, which ensure that neither u(t)\nnor v(t) reaches infinity in finite time.\nProposition 3 Suppose (WLOG) that u(0), v(0) > 0, that the hypotheses of Proposition 1\nhold, that\n\u03b32 >\n4f+\nu(0)\n(2.7)\nand that\nv(0)\nu(0)\n< m\n(\n\u03b3 +\n\u221a\n\u03b32 \u2212 4f+\/u(0)\n)\n.\nThen u(t) and v(t) remain finite for all times t.\nProof. It is sufficient to prove that v(t)\/u(t) is bounded for all t, for then we have\nu\u02d9(t) \u2264 const. u(t)\n4\nso that u(t) (and hence also v(t)) does not blow up. Let\n\u03c6(t) =\nv(t)\nu(t)\n.\nStraightforward calculations yield that\n\u03c6\u02d9 =\n2mf(t)\nu(t)\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03c6+ 1\n2m\n\u03c62.\nNow, the open first quadrant is positively invariant and so u\u02d9 = v > 0. Hence u(t) is strictly\nincreasing and so u(t) > u(0) for all t > 0. Hence\n\u03c6\u02d9 \u2264 2mf\n+\nu(0)\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03c6+ 1\n2m\n\u03c62.\nSolutions of the above differential inequality are bounded by the solution of the correspond-\ning differential equation. Simple arguments for one-dimensional ODEs, together with the\nhypotheses on \u03b3 and \u03c6(0), immediately yield that \u03c6(t) is bounded for all t. The proof is\ncomplete.\nWe may now state the main theorem of this section.\nTheorem 1 Let the hypotheses of Proposition 3 hold. Then solutions of (1.2) satisfy\n(x(t), y(t)) \u2192 (0, 0)\nmonotonically, as t\u2192\u221e.\nProof. To show that x(t) \u2192 0 we must show u(t) \u2192\u221e as t\u2192\u221e. Also, since\n2my = \u2212 v\nu(2m+1)\/(2m)\nthen, to show that y(t) \u2192 0 we shall show that \u03c8(t) \u2192 0 where\n\u03c8 =\nv\nu(2m+1)\/(2m)\n> 0. (2.8)\nFrom inequality (2.6) we have that\nlim inf\nt\u2192\u221e\nv(t) \u2265 2mf\u2212\/\u03b3.\nHence, there exists t1 > 0 such that, for all t \u2265 t1,\nv(t) \u2265 mf\u2212\/\u03b3.\nTherefore, for t \u2265 t1,\nu(t) = u(t1) +\n\u222b t\nt1\nv(s) ds\n\u2265 u(t1) + mf\n\u2212\n\u03b3\n(t\u2212 t1)\n5\nso that u(t) \u2192\u221e.\nNow, with \u03c8 defined by (2.8) it is straightforward to see that\n\u03c8\u02d9 =\n2mf(t)\n(u(t))(2m+1)\/(2m)\n\u2212 \u03b3\u03c8.\nLet \u03b5 > 0 be arbitrary. Since u(t) \u2192 \u221e as t \u2192 \u221e, and since f(t) is bounded, there exists\nt2 > 0 such that, for all t \u2265 t2,\n2mf(t)\n(u(t))(2m+1)\/(2m)\n< \u03b5.\nThen, for t \u2265 t2, we have\n\u03c8\u02d9 \u2264 \u03b5\u2212 \u03b3\u03c8\nfrom which it follows that\nlim sup\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u03c8(t) \u2264 \u03b5\n\u03b3\n.\nSince \u03b5 > 0 was arbitrary, it follows that lim supt\u2192\u221e \u03c8(t) \u2264 0. But \u03c8(t) > 0 for all t. Hence\nlimt\u2192\u221e \u03c8(t) = 0 and so limt\u2192\u221e y(t) = 0 also. The proof of the theorem is complete.\n3 Asymptotics and numerical simulations\nIn this section we shall conduct some further examination of the (u, v) phase space, together\nwith some numerical simulations, to gain further insight into the dynamics of the system and,\nin particular, the manner of the convergence of (x(t), y(t)) to (0, 0) as t \u2192 \u221e for suitably\nlarge \u03b3 > 0.\nOur numerical simulations indicate that, as t \u2192 \u221e, trajectories in the (u, v) phase plane\ntypically become trapped between the horizontal asymptotes of the two curves \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212\ndefined below, and shown in Fig. 1.\nNote that\ndv\ndu\n=\nv\u02d9\nu\u02d9\n=\n2mf(t)\nv\n\u2212 \u03b3 + (2m+ 1)\n2m\nv\nu\nand so, in particular, dv\/du < 0 in regions where\n2mf+\nv\n\u2212 \u03b3 + (2m+ 1)\n2m\nv\nu\n< 0 (3.1)\nand dv\/du > 0 in regions where\n2mf\u2212\nv\n\u2212 \u03b3 + (2m+ 1)\n2m\nv\nu\n> 0. (3.2)\nRecalling that u(t) increases in the open first quadrant, any trajectory can be characterised\nas the graph of a function, v = v(u). A trajectory has a turning point at any time when\ndv\/du = 0. This will happen at any time with\nv =\nm\u03b3u\n2m+ 1\n[\n1\u00b1\n\u221a\n1\u2212 4(2m+ 1)f(t)\n\u03b32u\n]\n. (3.3)\nReplacing f(t) in (3.3) by its upper and lower bounds defines two non-intersecting curves\n(provided f+ 6= f\u2212) in the (u, v) plane; we refer to these curves as \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 (they are\n6\n\u0393+\u0393\u2212\ndv\/du < 0dv\/du > 0\nv\nu\nv \n=\n 2m\n\u03b3 u\n\/(2\nm\n+\n1) \n- 2\nm\nf+ \/\u03b3\nv \n=\n 2m\n\u03b3 u\n\/(2\nm\n+\n1) \n- 2\nm\nf- \/\u03b3\ndv\/du > 0\nv = 2mf -\/\u03b3\nv = 2mf +\/\u03b3\nFigure 1: The curves \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 and their asymptotes. To the left of \u0393\u2212, dv\/du is positive\nand to the right of \u0393+ it is negative. Between \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212, dv\/du can be positive, negative or\nzero.\nalso defined by replacing the inequalities in (3.1) and (3.2) by equalities). Only in the region\nbetween \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 can a trajectory v(u) have a turning point. The curves \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 each\npossess two asymptotes, obtained by Taylor expanding (3.3). These are\nAsymptotes to \u0393\u00b1 =\n2m\u03b3\n2m+ 1\nu\u2212 2m\n\u03b3\nf\u00b1,\n2m\n\u03b3\nf\u00b1 (3.4)\nSince the horizontal asymptotes both have v > 0, and the other two asymptotes have neg-\native intercept with the v-axis, \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 must be confined to the first quadrant u, v > 0.\nFurthermore, in this quadrant v\u02d9, and hence dv\/du, are positive everywhere to the left of \u0393\u2212;\nsimilarly, dv\/du < 0 everywhere to the right of \u0393+. For v \u2264 0, dv\/du is everywhere positive.\nThe situation is sketched in Fig. 1.\nTypical solutions for various different initial data satisfying the conditions of Theorem 1 are\nillustrated in Fig. 2. The observations we have made so far indicate that, typically, u(t) \u2192\u221e\nwith v(t) remaining bounded, and these are borne out by the numerical solutions in Fig. 2.\nFor any value of \u03b3 and any initial data giving such an outcome, we can formally approximate\nthe differential equations (2.5) in the limit as t\u2192\u221e to yield the approximated system\nu\u02d9 = v\nv\u02d9 = 2mf(t)\u2212 \u03b3v.

The curves \u0393\u2212 and \u0393+ are shown dotted.\nfrom which it follows that u(t) is given asymptotically by\nu(t) \u223c 2m\n\u222b t\n0\n\u222b \u03be\n0\ne\u2212\u03b3(\u03be\u2212s)f(s) ds d\u03be\nor, on reversing the order of integration,\nu(t) \u223c 2m\n\u03b3\n\u222b t\n0\nf(s)(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212s)) ds.\nThus, for suitably large \u03b3 and suitable initial data, the convergence of x(t) to zero is given\nasymptotically by\nx(t) \u223c 1(\n2m\n\u03b3\n\u222b t\n0 f(s)(1\u2212 e\u2212\u03b3(t\u2212s)) ds\n) 1\n2m\n.\nAttraction to the origin is not the only dynamics displayed by Equation (1.1); a variety of\nperiodic solutions exist as well, as shown in Figure 3.\n8\n-20 -10 0 10 20\n-300\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n300\n-20 -10 0 10 20\n-200\n-100\n0\n100\n200\n-6 -4 -2 0 2 4 6\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n-5 0 5\n-60\n-40\n-20\n0\n20\n40\n60\nFigure 3: Numerical solutions to (1.1) with f(t) = 3 + 2 cos 2pit and \u03b3 = 0.04.
