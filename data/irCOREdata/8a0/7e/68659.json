Introduction\nA fundamental reality throughout the geophysical and planetary world is the existence flows. Ion\nbeams parallel to the magnetic field are a hallmark of the upward current region. Large electric\nfields found in the Earth\u2019s auroral zone produce shears in the ion flow both parallel and perpendic-\nular to the magnetic field. These shears are observed simultaneously and result from the localized\nnature of the large, high-altitude, perpendicular electric fields and their equipotential closure at\naltitudes above the ionosphere. In regions where auroral ion beams form (3000\u20136000 km) the\nmagnitude of the shear in the ion flow along the magnetic field is typically an order of magnitude\nlarger than its magnitude in the perpendicular flow. At higher altitudes, shears in the parallel flow\ndecreases with the magnetic field, while shears in the perpendicular flow are relatively constant\nwith altitude.\nExperimental observations, made during equatorial spread F (ESF) (1) and in the high-latitude\nionospheric F region (2), indicate that ionospheric plasmas usually support inhomogeneous equi-\nlibrium plasma flows. In the case of ESF, it was found that the flow velocities reverse their direction\nas a function of altitude (the direction of the density gradient). Furthermore, the velocity reversal\npoint moves up as the spread F develops. This equilibrium situation, where the flow velocity\nprofile is not related to the density profile in a simple manner, is generated by the coupling of the\n*Corresponding author.

Fukuyama et al.\nplasma to the neutral atmosphere, for example, by the neutral winds and the inherent shear in the\nneutral wind velocity or, in the case of ESF, due to an incomplete coupling caused by background\nionospheric Pedersen conductivity away from the equatorial plane (3).\nLarge plasma flows are also a hallmark of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, magnetotail and plasma\nsheet. It has been recognized in an early substorm research that high-speed plasma flows occur\nduring substorms. In the plasmasphere, steep shear in ion flow velocity can exist due to the domi-\nnating co-rotating electric field inside the plasmasphere and a convective magnetospheric electric\nfield penetrating across the plasmapause (4). Also there are a number of observational confir-\nmations of the presence of a variety of plasma flows in the upper levels of the solar atmosphere\n(spicules and macrospicules, reconnection outflows, jets in coronal holes, etc.). Often, the flows\nare directed along the magnetic field and are compact in the transversal direction. Note that the\ninhomogeneous flows do not always coincide with the inhomogeneities in the fluid or plasma\ndensity and magnetic field. Moreover, even in a homogeneous fluid, there can be inhomogeneous\nflows, corresponding to the shifting of one fluid layer relative to another, along the magnetic field\n(5). Also the boundaries between the fast and slow streams of the solar wind flow is also sheared.\nSimilarly, Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability (which can be excited when velocity shear is present\nwithin a continuous fluid or when there is a sufficient velocity difference across the interface\nbetween two fluids) occurs when wind blows over a water surface. The instability manifests itself\nin the form of waves being generated on the water surface, at the interaction of two bands of the\nplanet\u2019s atmosphere or in the clouds. Non-uniform fluid and plasma flow are also common in the\nfusion energy reactor and in the volcanic eruptions of magma.\nThis wide existence of flow in the space environment has triggered theories which have taken\naccount of the effect of such flows. While most theories deal with a rigid flow, some recent theories\nalso address the effect of sheared flows. In Earth\u2019s ionosphere, it is usually believed that the spatial\ntransverse shear in the parallel (magnetic field aligned) flow destabilizes many low-frequency (LF)\noscillations and this may be the origin of LF oscillations in the ionosphere (6, 7). It has been shown\nby Satyanarayana et al. (8) if the flow shear in the topside ionosphere is strong enough, it can\ninduce some large scale irregularities. For sufficient velocity shear, irregularities of scale sizes\nof 300 km with weak growth rates (10\u22123 s\u22121) could exist in the weakly collisional topside of\nthe ionosphere. Furthermore, sheared flows can have pronounced effects on the collisional and\ncollisionless Rayleigh\u2013Taylor (RT) instabilities. Sufficiently strong velocity shear preferentially\nexcites a long wavelength mode. This result may explain the long wavelength oscillations of the\nbottomside F layer during the ESF.\nSimilarly, the ultra-LF (ULF) oscillations in the magnetosphere has been proposed to be gener-\nated by the shear flow instability (9, 10). The in situ Cluster measurements support the hypothesis\nthat, during intervals of fast solar wind speed, the Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instability can excite mag-\nnetospheric waveguide modes which bathe the flank magnetosphere with discrete frequency ULF\nwave power and drive large-amplitude field line resonances (10). Similar results were also obtained\nby Vinas (4) in connection with the investigations of the erosion of the plasmapause. He conjec-\ntured that strong velocity shear could exist in the plasmapause region and has shown that this can\nlead to long-wavelength irregularities.\nHowever, although flow shear has widely been proposed as the main cause of the origin of\nvarious LF and ULF oscillations in the planetary space, the conformity to various spacecraft data\ndoes not seem to be always obvious. For example, for the Earth\u2019s ionospheric LF oscillations,\nwhile comparing with the Fast Auroral Snapshot (FAST) satellite data in the upward current\nregion, although some similarities are observed in accordance with the theoretical flow shear\nmodels, there seems to be much more which actually does not conform to these theoretical\npredictions. Similarly, for the magnetospheric ULF, a close conformity with the Cluster data is\nyet to be found. So, it appears that the origin of LF oscillations in the ionosphere and elsewhere\nin the space might owe their origin to some other cause than the flow.\nRadiation Effects & Defects in Solids: Incorporating Plasma Science & Plasma Technology 125\nThe ability of the charged dust particles to alter the properties of various plasma waves and\ninstabilities have been studied extensively in recent years (11\u201317). In some cases it is found that\nthe presence of dust causes the occurrence of new modes such as the dust acoustic modes (12),\nwhereas in other cases the presence of dust is found to render a stable mode unstable such as\nthe electron drift waves (18, 19). Whenever a heavy fluid is supported by a light fluid and a\nperturbation occurs in the boundary separating the two media, the plasma becomes unstable if the\ngravitational force acts in the direction of decreasing density. This instability is the RT instability\nand it is found to occur not only in space environments such as in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, in\nthe F-layer of the ionosphere but also in the laboratory plasmas, ranging from industrially applied\nplasmas such as in pulsed power technology to plasmas in fusion devices. In a dusty plasma, the\nRT instability arises whenever a similar situation occurs as in a pristine plasma with the difference\nthat the dusty plasma now represents the heavy fluid and the magnetic field the light fluid.Although\nthis instability has been studied from the local as well as the non-local theoretical approach in a\npristine plasma (17), in the case of dusty plasmas, the investigation of the RT instability has been\nmainly carried out in a local approach by several investigators (18, 19).\nHere, we undertake the study of RT instability in a dusty plasma from a non-local approach\nin the Earth\u2019s ionosphere. We use a three-fluids approach in an inhomogeneous dusty plasma,\nand an eigenmode equation is derived to study the stability of the mode. Typical parameters from\nionosphere are used to investigate the actual stability of the mode. The growth rate of the RT mode\nis found to be considerably higher in a dusty plasma than in a pure plasma. This might have a\ncrucial role in explaining the LF fluctuations in the ionosphere, the origin of which, as discussed\nabove, is not quite understood at present. We also investigate the effects of the dust charge, the\ndust mass and the dust density on the growth rate of the instability.\n2. Stability analysis\nAs in the case of the dusty plasma model developed for the Saturn\u2019s ring, we consider a plasma\nmade up of electrons, ions and dust particles. The development of the work follows closely with\nthat developed for the Saturn\u2019s ring. However, for the sake of completeness, we describe the major\nparts of the theoretical model below. The nature of the charge on the dust grains is governed by a\nnumber of competing processes such as photoelectric emission, secondary emission, etc. In most\nof the cases, it is found that the dust particles are negatively charged due to the higher mobility of\nthe electrons. Therefore, we consider negatively charged dust particles of uniform average charge.\nAs before, we consider a Cartesian coordinate system with a plasma boundary in the YZ plane,\nthe uniform magnetic field is in the Z-direction, acceleration due to gravity acts in the X-direction\nand with the density gradient profile of the form no(x) = noo exp(\u2212x2\/2L2n). We consider the\ntwo-dimensional mode structure in the XY plane only by neglecting the perturbation along the\nmagnetic field direction so that (K\u2016 = 0). The ions as well as the dust particles are taken to be cold\nso that Ti, Td = 0, and hence the pressure terms that arise from these two quantities are ignored.\nAny effect arising due to the finite gyroradius of the ions and dust particles is neglected since we\nlimit our analysis to the wavelength domain Ky\u03c1si, Ky\u03c1sd \u0003 1. Since the plasma is inhomogenous\nin the X-direction only, the perturbations takes the form \u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6(x) exp[i(Kyy \u2212 \u03c9t)].\nThen the fundamental fluid equations of continuity and momentum transfer will be given by:\n\u2202n\u03b1\n\u2202t\n+ \u2207.(n\u03b1V\u03b1) = 0 (1)\nand\nmj\n(\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n+ Vj .\u2207\n)\nVj = eE + eVj \u00d7 B\nc\n+ mjg.

The parameter values we choose are Ni \u0006 1012\/cm3, Md \u0006 10\u221218 g, Nd \u0006 108\/cm3,\nZd \u0006 100, Lni \u0006 Lne \u0006 Lnd \u0006 104 cm, kTe \u0006 2 eV, B \u0006 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 T, g \u0006 9.3 m\/s2. It is inter-\nesting to note that the grain size does not enter the equations directly. However, the grain mass and\ncharge that enter the equations are related to the grain size. It might be noted that all parameter\nvalues chosen are only representative values, and the results are likely to be valid beyond the\nlimits considered in this paper.\nFigure 1(a) plots the real frequency of the RT mode for pure plasma, whereas Figure 1(b) plots\nthe growth rate. This is the standard result for the RT mode. Figure 2 plots the same in the presence\nof dust particles. It is found that the growth rate in a dusty plasma is significantly higher than in a\npure plasma. This shows that the presence of dust makes the RT instability much more unstable.\nThe growth rate in both cases, as expected, increases with ky before it becomes independent of\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0(a)\n(b)\n\u03c9 r\n \n[s\u2013\n1 ]\n0 2x103 4x103 6x103 8x103 1x104\nLn [cm]\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n1.2\n1.6\n2.0\n0 2x103 4x103 6x103 8x103 1x104\nLn [cm]\n\u03b3 \n[s\u2013\n1 ]\nFigure 6.

The growth rate for the dusty plasma reaches this saturation level for a small increase in ky .\nHowever, the nature of the graph, specially the bifurcation, needs extra attention, as of now we\ndo not have clear picture for its origin.\nFrom Figure 3, the plot of \u03b3 and Md shows that the growth rate decreases from a higher\nvalue before it reaches a saturation level when it is independent of the mass of the dust particles.\nLarger grain implies greater inertia and hence this acts as an impediment to the free growth of the\ninstability.\nFigure 4 plots \u03b3 with Nd. With the increase in the dust density Nd, the growth rate decreases.\nThis is opposite to the case of Saturn\u2019s ring. With an increase in the dust density, the inter-grain\ndistance decreases. This in turn increases the inter-grain repulsion due to Coulomb forces. So,\nthe two contradictory effects play the part here. Depending on their strengths, this results in a\nstronger or weaker distorting force that might increase or decrease the growth rate, respectively.\nFigure 5 plots \u03b3 with Zd. With the increase in the number of charges Zd on the dust particles,\nthe growth rate rises drastically and then assumes a saturation level. This trend is different from\nthe case of Saturn\u2019s ring where the growth rate increases uniformly. An increase in the number of\ncharges would cause the potential resulting from the charge separation to increase in magnitude\nand this results in a stronger distorting force that unsettles the equilibrium parameters. There is\nan interesting sign change in Figure 5(a); the real cause of it is yet to be determined.\nFigure 6 plots \u03b3 with Ln. With the increase in Ln, the growth rate rises drastically and then\nassumes a saturation level. This is a trend similar to the Zd variation, so the underlying physics is\nexpected to be similar.\n3. Conclusion\nWe have developed and applied non-local theoretical and numerical model to study the RT insta-\nbility in an inhomogeneous dusty plasma in the Earth\u2019s ionosphere in the presence of a uniform\nmagnetic field. We use three-fluids equations and an eigenmode equation is derived to study the\nstability of the mode. Typical ionospheric parameters are used to investigate the actual stability\nof the mode. The growth rate of the RT is found to be considerably higher in a dusty plasma than\nin a pure plasma. This might be the clue in explaining the origin of the LF oscillations in the\nionosphere. The usual theory believes that it is the parallel flow shear that actually drives various\nLF space fluctuations. However, theory here indicates that it might be the presence of dust that\nmight be responsible for the origin of LF oscillations in the ionosphere. The effects of the dust\ncharge, dust mass, dust density and the density scale length on the growth rate of the instability\nare also investigated. While the effect of the increase in Zd and Ln is found to increase the growth\nrate, the effect in Md and Nd acts in the opposite way. With the increase in Md, the growth rate\ndecreases till it reaches a stage when it is independent of the variations of Md.\nThe non-local theory developed by us allows us to treat variable density gradient in contrast to\nthe local theory, where only a fixed density gradient can be considered. Furthermore, the authors\nof non-local theory neglect diamagnetic drift which is expected to have a strong destabilizing\neffect for modes where density gradient is a driving term of the instability (like drift or RT\ninstability). The linear theory should indeed retain the effect of the diamagnetic contribution as\nit is the leading-order contribution in contrast to the polarization drift which is a higher-order\neffect (21).\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by European Commission\u2019s FP7 grant no. 220386.\nRadiation Effects & Defects in Solids: Incorporating Plasma Science & Plasma Technology 133\nReferences\n(1) Kudeki E.; Lazzarus, E.
