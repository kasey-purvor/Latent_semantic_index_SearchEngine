Reversals of apparently completed changes are reported for\nmergers; however, mergers are the phonological consequence of phonetic\nchanges, not the process that may have led to this consequence. Prime examples\nof such processes are vocalic chain shifts (Hock, 1986:156\u2013158, 637\u2013639;\nLabov, 1994), which are held to be subject to functional (Meillet, 1967:104\u2013105)\nand psychoacoustic (Lindblom, 1986) constraints, leading to the maintenance of\nphonetic distance between phonological units and an apparent striving for\nWe are grateful to the Economic and Social Research Council for funding the project Linguistic\nInnovators: The English of Adolescents in London (Ref.

From a\nseries of observations, he derived three Principles of Vowel Shifting\n(1994:115\u2013122), which we give here because of their relevance to our later\ndiscussion:\nPRINCIPLE I\nIn chain shifts, long vowels rise.\nPRINCIPLE II\nIn chain shifts, short vowels fall.\nPRINCIPLE IIA\nIn chain shifts, the nuclei of upgliding diphthongs fall.\nPRINCIPLE III\nIn chain shifts, back vowels move to the front.\n(Labov, 1994:116)\nLabov further identified four frequently occurring patterns, or combinations of\nchanges, governed by the three principles. Two of these patterns will be relevant\nhere: the raising and backing of open vowels and the fronting of back close and\nmid vowels (Labov\u2019s pattern 3); the raising of front short vowels and the\nlowering of the onsets of FLEECE and FACE1 (Labov\u2019s pattern 4). These patterns\nare found in accents undergoing the \u201cSouthern Shift,\u201d reportedly taking place in\nthe southern United States, Australia, New Zealand, and in parts of southeast\nEngland, including London (Labov, 1994:201\u2013208).\nLabov stated that his principles are not universal (\u201cno directions of vowel\nshifting are forbidden to speakers of human language\u201d [1994:116]), but rather\nthey are directions that are taken much more often than not. The reason why they\nare not universal, by which we mean exceptionless, is that the application of a\nprinciple is subject to both linguistic and social constraints that apply\nprobabilistically. He expressed this as follows:\nIf we had enough data, we would expect to find that Principles I\u2013III govern the\noutcome with frequencies varying from moderately high to close to 1.00, and we\nwould be able to isolate those features of the contextual situation that are\nresponsible for the principle\u2019s applying with a given probability. (Labov, 1994:137)\nSocial constraints (the \u201ccontextual situation\u201d) not only have the potential to inhibit,\nbut even to reverse an ongoing shift. Labov mentioned three cases where social\nfactors appear to lead to a reversal, and these seem to be driven by relatively\nconscious \u201csocial pressures\u201d (1994:140). Labov\u2019s account, however, lacks detail.\nThe clearest example he mentioned is a reversal of the Parisian chain shift\n(Lennig, 1978, 1979), where a merger of the oral vowels =a= and =\u0251= leads to a\nreversal of raising (=\u0254= moves down to the space vacated by =\u0251=, violating\nPrinciple I) and a reversal of fronting (the fronted allophones of =o= and =\u0254=\nmove back, violating Principle III). This occurs at the same time as the Parisian\nnasal vowels continue to move in an counterclockwise direction, following\n452 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nLabov\u2019s principles, in a change from below (Hansen, 2001). The \u201ccorrection\u201d of\nthe Parisian shift is overt and such forces have also been found to influence\nvowel shifts in Philadelphia and New York, but Labov pointed out that \u201cthey do\nnot affect the innovative forces and the new and vigorous changes that operate\nbelow the level of social consciousness\u201d (1994:140). Are there, then, covert\neffects on vowel shifts? In Figure 18.5 in the Atlas of North American English\n(Labov, Ash, & Boberg, 2005), the authors described a reversal in the\ncentralization of FACE (i.e., changes in F2): the centralization is receding over\ntime, leading to a smaller distance between FACE and DRESS in the F2 dimension.\nThey pointed out that this is a reversal of the Southern Shift, but because there is\nno significant change in F1 (i.e., vowel height), it is problematic to claim that it\nis a general reversal of the shift.\nWe have earlier described a short vowel shift in Reading in southeast England\nthat exhibited a series of changes that could not be accounted for by any chain\nshift model. We proposed that dialect contact leading to regional dialect leveling\n(supralocalization) was the underlying language-external factor (Torgersen &\nKerswill, 2004). In the present article, we add detail to the understanding of how\nsocial forces at a speech community level can reverse awell-established vowel shift.\nD I P H T H O N G S H I F T\u2014 A N AT U RA L P RO C E S S ?\nThe set of possibly linked vowel changes we will deal with in this article have been\ncollectively labeled Diphthong Shift (Wells, 1982:306\u2013310). It is found in\nsoutheast England, including London, and also in Birmingham and elsewhere in\nthe Midlands. The Survey of English Dialects (SED) (Orton & Tilling, 1970;\nOrton & Wakelin, 1967) shows shifted qualities in an area stretching from the\nsouth coast to Derbyshire and Staffordshire in the Midlands. The shifted\nqualities have been present for a long time: Ellis described diphthong-shifted\nqualities in his \u201cEastern\u201d areas stretching from Bedfordshire to Essex (for FACE,\nPRICE, MOUTH, and GOAT [1889:192\u2013193, 199\u2013200, 209\u2013210]) but also in parts of\nthe \u201cSouthern\u201d area in Berkshire. We can find examples of shifted MOUTH and\nPRICE in Hampstead Norris (near Newbury, Berkshire) (Ellis, 1889:95\u201396).\nDiphthong Shift is also a feature of Australian and New Zealand English (Wells,\n1982:597\u2013600, 607\u2013608). Labov implicitly discussed Diphthong Shift as a\ncomponent of Southern Shift: the onsets of what Labov claimed to be the\nnonperipheral vowels (with onsets located more toward the center of the vowel\nsystem) FLEECE and FACE move to a lower position, while the peripheral vowels\nrise (Labov, 1994:208\u2013218) (see Torgersen & Kerswill [2004:28\u201329] for a\ndiscussion of the process involving the short vowels). PRICE and MOUTH are\nconsidered peripheral; their onsets move up along the back (PRICE) and front\n(MOUTH) peripheral tracks, respectively.\nIn Diphthong Shift, front closing diphthongs shift counterclockwise. Figure 1\nshows the movement with Received Pronunciation (RP) as baseline. According to\nWells\u2019s (1982) model, FLEECE, FACE, PRICE, and CHOICE shift by about one cardinal\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 453\nvowel. Meanwhile, back closing diphthongs shift clockwise. Figure 2 shows the\n(claimed) movements for MOUTH, GOAT, and GOOSE. For example, PRICE shifts from\n[a\u026a] to [\u0251\u026a] and MOUTH from [a\u028a] to [\u00e6\u028a]. This leads to the \u201cPRICE-MOUTH\ncrossover\u201d (Wells, 1982:310), whereby PRICE has a back onset and MOUTH a front\nonset\u2014unlike RP, which is assumed to be more conservative on this point.\nAll this presupposes that RP does actually represent an earlier stage in the\nrealization of the diphthongs. However, this may not give a true picture of the\ndevelopment: we do not know if London English ever passed through this stage.\nFor example, we have evidence from Britain (2005) that a preshifted quality of\nMOUTH as [\u0259\u028a] was relatively widespread in rural 19th-century dialects in\nsoutheast England and the Midlands, alongside the shifted qualities [\u00e6\u028a]\u223c[\u025b\u028a],\nwhereas the open variant [a\u028a] was virtually unknown, especially in what are\ntoday\u2019s diphthong-shifting areas. Consequently, the development of [\u00e6\u028a]\u223c[\u025b\u028a]\n(assuming these are the later forms) was fronting, not raising. Britain (2001,\n2005) argued that shifted variants of MOUTH and PRICE were certainly already\npresent in the speech of the majority of the British settlers in New Zealand, and\nthe development there of diphthong-shifted vowels was not a raising from open\nto open-mid front realizations (such as [\u025b\u02d5\u0259\u02d4]), but more a leveling process, in this\ncase dialect contact, where the open-mid front realization won because it was the\n\u201cdominant, majority and innovative form\u201d (Britain, 2005:171) in the community.\nHowever, Britain also pointed out that diphthong-shifted variants of FACE were\nprobably rare among the immigrants to New Zealand, which led him to argue\nthat much of the lowering of the onset of FACE \u201cwould have taken place on New\nZealand soil\u201d (2005:179)\u2014a conclusion that is fully compatible with drift.\nWhatever their origin, diphthong-shifted vowels are today a feature of almost all\nNew Zealand varieties of English.\nIf Diphthong Shift is inevitable in the sense of being the consequence of a\nlinguistically motivated principle, it follows that it must be the outcome of a\nnatural process. Such processes have been described in natural phonology,\naccording to which phonological variation arises from variable success in\nFIGURE 1. Diphthong Shift in front closing diphthongs Adapted and modified from Wells\n(1982:308).\nFIGURE 2. Diphthong Shift in back closing diphthongs Adapted and modified from Wells\n(1982:310).\n454 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nsuppressing natural processes: phonological processes always occur unless they are\noverridden (Stampe, 1979). It may be the case that, unlike in England, social\nconstraints on Diphthong Shift were never sufficiently strong in New Zealand\nEnglish to prevent its universal spread (or, particularly for shifted MOUTH, the\nmaintenance of its position), and indeed it has become phonetically even more\nmarked than in England (Trudgill, 2004).\nA claim of universality is certainly implied for Diphthong Shift. However, it\nmay not be the case that a process or feature observed in a large number of\nvernacular varieties of a language, and therefore regarded as a kind of language-\nspecific universal, occurs in all vernacular varieties of that language.\nSzmrecsanyi and Kortmann (forthcoming) discuss such features in English\n(referring to them as Angloversals). They state that some grammatical features, at\nleast, may have a geographically restricted distribution: some vernacular\n\u201cuniversals\u201d are found in all varieties of American English, but not in all other\nEnglishes. We therefore need to be skeptical when referring to \u201clanguage-\nspecific\u201d universals. We turn now to the historical and contemporary evidence\nfor Diphthong Shift in New Zealand and the south of England.\nD R I F T A N D D I P H T H O N G S H I F T I N N EW Z E A L A N D E N G L I S H\nTrudgill (2004, Trudgill et al., 2000) argued that New Zealand English inherited\nthe tendency toward diphthong shifting, not the forms themselves. Among the\noldest New Zealanders recorded, born from 1850 to 1869, 68% have at least\nsome diphthong shifting, and these vowels can, presumably, be described as\nimported from Britain. However, for those born from 1870 to 1889, the figure\nrises to 81% (Trudgill, 2004:50), suggesting, Trudgill claimed, a continuation of\nthe process of Diphthong Shift. The shift, in fact, becomes phonetically more\nmarked with the later-born informants, who in addition have a still higher\nproportion of shifted variants, and shifting also occurs in a larger number of\nvowels. It is argued that New Zealand English today has diphthongs that are\nmore shifted than varieties of English English (Gordon et al., 2004:241).\nMeasurements of diphthongs in Australian English also show the persistence of\nthe shifted qualities (Cox, 1999). Shifting, according to Trudgill (2004:50),\nfollowed a fixed route, occurring first in MOUTH, before it moved on to PRICE,\nGOAT, FACE, GOOSE, and FLEECE. Consequently, a speaker could have shifted\nvariants in MOUTH and PRICE, but not in FACE. Another combination, shifted\nvowels in MOUTH and FACE, but not in PRICE, is not found (Gordon et al., 2004:241).\nThe inherent tendency to change is, according to Trudgill, a feature of what\nSapir (1921) described as \u201cdrift.\u201d The term was introduced to show how dialects\nand languages arise and change. Sapir suggested that differences between\ndialects are not due to idiolectal variation, but to inherent properties within\nlanguage: \u201cLanguage moves down time in a current of its own making. It has a\ndrift\u201d (1921:150). This means that social norms have little impact on the way a\nlanguage will develop. The idea is that \u201cdialects arise \u2026 because two or more\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 455\ngroups of individuals have become sufficiently disconnected to drift apart, or\nindependently, instead of together\u201d (Sapir, 1921:150). This reflects what\nhappened in New Zealand and accounts for the gradual divergence of New\nZealand and British varieties. However, drift also refers to shared, or parallel\nchanges in geographically separated varieties, and it is this that Trudgill (2004)\nfocuses on in his discussion of New Zealand English. According to Sapir, in the\nformation of dialects, and languages, there are some features that \u201cdialects keep\ntogether long after they have grown to be mutually alien forms of speech. But\nthat is not all. The momentum of the more fundamental, the pre-dialectic, drift is\noften such that languages long disconnected will pass through the same or\nstrikingly similar phases\u201d (Sapir, 1921:172). Sapir mentioned the development\nof noun plurals with umlaut in English and German as an example of this; even\nthough the forms appear 300 years later in German, there was an inherent\ntendency in Germanic to develop the forms even though proto-Germanic itself\ndid not have them. In other words, the language had a propensity to change.\nTrudgill claimed that drift is the force behind the occurrence of similar features\nin modern day English English and New Zealand English: \u201cwe can argue that\nsome similarities between geographically separated varieties of English may, in\nsome cases, be due not to their having derived from similar dialect mixtures, nor\nto characteristics inherited directly from some parent variety, nor to any\ndiffusion or direct contact between them, but to drift\u201d (Trudgill, 2004:132). Even\nif, as Britain (2005:171) pointed out, Diphthong Shift in New Zealand English is\npartly a matter of leveling, the continuation of the phonetic processes are still\ncompatible with a drift explanation. Following Trudgill\u2019s argument, and if we\nregard Diphthong Shift as a \u201cnatural\u201d process, we should be able to observe\nsimilar developments in diphthongs in present-day London English, because\nLondon is within an area that traditionally had both central and shifted onsets of\ndiphthongs as well as being, it is often argued, the major center of innovation in\nBritish English (Wells, 1982:301).\nHowever, we should be careful not to treat drift as one single force in language\nchange: a language can have several drifts not necessarily going in the same\ndirection (Fortescue, 2006:312). Instead, we should understand drift to mean a\n\u201cslowly occurring change \u2026 bearing on a single, isolated, undisturbed\nevolutionary strain or streak\u201d (Malkiel, 1981:566). However, although such a\nprocess is \u201ctheoretically defensible,\u201d it should nevertheless be regarded as\n\u201chighly speculative and unrealistic as regards real-life developments of speech\ncommunities\u201d (Malkiel, 1981:566). Malkiel instead proposed the term slant to\ndescribe processes such as Diphthong Shift in New Zealand English: \u201cthose\n[resemblances] resulting from common descent of two or more given languages,\nand traceable to an earlier common stage (recorded or reconstructed)\u201d (Malkiel,\n1981:566) (following the discussion in Britain and Sudbury [2002:231], though\nthose authors argued that Diphthong Shift probably did not meet the criteria for\nbeing an example of slant). What characterizes this type of change is \u201cits\ninherent or intrinsic character \u2026 slowness \u2026 [and] fundamentally unconscious,\nsubmerged character\u201d (Malkiel, 1981:547). Clearly, none of these characteristics,\n456 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nas given by Malkiel, can be classified as resulting from external factors. We argue,\ninstead, that it is external factors, in particular dialect contact and possibly\nnormative forces, that play a stronger role in change than the putative internal\nfactor of drift. Comparing the typologically similar phonetic varieties of New\nZealand and London, with their entirely different sociolinguistic histories,\nenables us to discern what the nature of that role is.\nD I P H T H O N G S H I F T I N LO N D O N E N G L I S H\nWe can observe diphthong-shifted vowels very clearly among elderly speakers in\nLondon. Figures 3 and 4 show vowel plots for representative working class\nspeakers from established families in inner London. Because the shift is\n(traditionally) more dramatic in Cockney than in Popular London English, we\nshould be able to observe fully shifted vowels. Figure 3 shows the diphthongs for\na male speaker born in 1938 (average onset and offset values for the diphthongs\nare normalized; normalized average formant values for the monophthongs DRESS,\nTRAP, STRUT, START, and FOOT and the diphthong CHOICE are included for reference;\nsee later discussion for information on the normalization procedure). MOUTH is\nfronted and is nearly monophthongal and sits just below DRESS and above and\nslightly ahead of TRAP. PRICE has a back and raised onset and is more back and\nhigher than START. GOAT has a lowered onset. FACE has a very open onset, just\nabove STRUT. FOOT is close and back, and CHOICE has a raised onset. In sum, this\nspeaker has a fully diphthong-shifted system such as that envisaged by Wells in\nFigures 1 and 2.\nFigure 4 shows the system for a female speaker born in 1928. Again, average\nvalues for DRESS, TRAP, STRUT, START, FOOT, and CHOICE are included for reference\nFIGURE 3. Elderly male speaker from Hackney born 1938.\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 457\non the vowel plot. As with the male speaker, the female speaker also has a very open\nonset for FACE, near STRUT, and PRICE has a back raised onset, which is above and is\nmore back than START. There is a raised onset for CHOICE. MOUTH is front with a short\noffglide and is placed above and in front of TRAP, but lower in relation to DRESS\ncompared with the male speaker in Figure 3. GOAT has a central onset and is just\nbehind FOOT. Again there is Diphthong Shift, but to a slightly lesser degree than\nfor the male speaker. The relationships between MOUTH=TRAP and PRICE=START for\nboth the male and the female speakers are similar to the ones on the plots for\nLondoners Marie Colville and John Gale, who were recorded in the 1960s\n(Labov, 1994). Marie Colville has MOUTH realized with a fronted nucleus that we\ncan represent as [e\u00fc], above and in front of TRAP and higher than the nucleus of\nFACE (as our speaker on Figure 3). PRICE is in the region of [\u0254\u026a] and is fully\nbacked and raised with its nucleus higher than GOAT (Labov, 1994:169\u2013170).\nJohn Gale (Labov, 1994:209\u2013210) shows similar vowel movements, but even\nmore extreme lowering of FLEECE and FACE, following Labov\u2019s shift pattern 4.\nWe find similar qualities in impressionistic descriptions. Sivertsen studied\ndiphthongs in London\u2019s East End (the eastern part of the inner city). MOUTH\ncould have a long, fully open front unrounded monophthong [a\u02d0] (Sivertsen,\n1960:66), which was found \u201conly among men and boys of a less polished type.\u201d\nThe most common variant is apparently a diphthong in the [\u025b\u2010\u01dd\u2010] to [\u025b\u2010\u028a] area. The\nquality is said to be closer than RP: almost front and slightly closer than open-\nmid (Sivertsen, 1960:67). PRICE has [\u0251\u2010\u026a] with a \u201ctruly back initial element\u201d that is\ngenerally unrounded and more back than BATH (Sivertsen, 1960:64). Matthews\n(1938:79) described PRICE with a raised onset. Wells (1982:308) stated that the\nonset may be rounded [\u0252] in \u201cvigorous, \u2018dialectal\u2019 Cockney,\u201d and the offset may\nbe reduced. GOAT is described as [\u0153\u028a], which is more front than RP, and also\nFIGURE 4. Elderly female speaker from Hackney born 1928.\n458 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\n\u201cwider\u201d (Sivertsen, 1960:88). The starting point is between front and central and\nopen-mid. Wells (1982:308\u2013309) stated that this is between [\u00e6\u00a8] and [\u0250]. The end\npoint may be rounded or unrounded. FACE is described as having a much more\nopen initial element than RP, but with considerable variation in both quality and\nquantity: \u201cmake\u201d [m\u00e6\u012dk] (she used [\u026a\u02d8] to indicate a nonsyllabic vowel). The\nmost open realizations are considered \u201crougher,\u201d more characteristically\nCockney and vernacular: these are realizations in the area of cardinal [a].\nHurford (1967) studied the speech of one East End (Bethnal Green) family with\nmembers born between 1885 and 1953. MOUTH (Hurford, 1967:403\u2013405) shows\nmainly monophthongal realizations among the elderly males (born 1885, 1923,\nand 1924) in the region of [\u0250\u02d5\u00fe]. Diphthongs start around [a\u02d4], very near [\u00e6], and\nsometimes also slightly more central; they are more frequent among women than\nmen. The end point is usually around [\u028a], [\u01dd], or [\u0250]. The young male informant\n(born 1953) has an end point around [\u025b]. PRICE (Hurford, 1967:456) has a\nmajority of diphthongal realizations, though there are some monophthongs,\nespecially in the word \u201cI.\u201d The elderly speakers have a starting quality around\n[\u0251], and some realizations may be rounded. The youngest speakers (born 1949\nand 1953) have starting points that are slightly more central and less open: [\u0251\u02d4\u00a8].\nSome starting points for the young speakers may be even more fronted to around\n[\u0250\u02d5\u00fe] and even [a]\u2014these qualities suggest a \u201creversal\u201d of Diphthong Shift\u2014if we\nfollow Wells\u2019s description of the process, though as Britain (2005:172\u2013174)\npointed out, such open onsets were rare in southeast England 100 years ago, but\ncentral schwalike onsets were more widespread, from which the shifted, open-\nmid back variants could have developed. The end points for PRICE vary from [\u01dd]\nto [\u026a]. GOAT (Hurford, 1967:462) always has diphthongal realizations starting\nwith [\u0250\u00fe], but also [\u00e6\u00a8]. End points are around [\u01dd] and [\u028a], but in one female\nspeaker (born 1929) may be fronted to [\u0289] or even [\u028f]. This may be the first time\nthat GOAT-fronting is reported. FACE (Hurford, 1967:453\u2013454) nearly always has\ndiphthongal realizations. There is considerable variation in the starting points.\nAll are shifted and are located in an area stretching from [\u025b] to [a] to [\u0250\u02d5], though\nthe end point is usually [\u026a]. There is no systematic variation across age groups.\nBeaken (1971) studied the language of children ages 4\u20139 in Bow in the East\nEnd. The 9-year-olds have a diphthong system broadly similar to that found by\nHurford. MOUTH (Beaken, 1971:230\u2013231) may (more often) be a monophthong\n[\u00e6\u02d0] or a diphthong [\u00e6\u01dd], [\u00e6\u0264\u00a8], or [\u00e6\u028a]. PRICE (Beaken, 1971:247) has a\ncentralized starting point in an area around [\u0250\u00a8] or [\u0250\u02d5\u00fe]. Beaken notes that \u201cglides\nfrom fully back seem to be characteristic of vigorous or dialectal types of\nspeech\u201d (1971:247). Diphthongs with these back starting points may be slightly\nor fully rounded. GOAT (Beaken, 1971:242\u2013243) is [\u0250\u0264\u00a8], [\u0250\u0264\u2010], or [\u0250\u028a]. Girls may\nhave a fronted, rounded offset: [\u0250\u00f8\u00a8] or [\u0250\u00ff\u02d5]. These variants were never found\namong boys. Again, this is an early report of GOAT-fronting. GOAT may also be\nmonophthongal in some stressed positions, especially in the words no [n\u0251\u02d0] and\nknow [n\u0250\u02d0]. FACE (Beaken, 1971:234) is realized as [\u00e6\u02d5\u026a], [\u00e4\u026a], or [\u00e6\u026a]. The more\nopen variants are more common than the closer ones. Monophthongs are also\nfound in some stressed positions but these were rare with nursery children.\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 459\nOverall, the nursery children (aged 4) had more variation in their realization of all\nthe diphthongs, but it was not systematic.\nHudson and Holloway (1977) examined GOOSE, FACE, GOAT, MOUTH, and PRICE in\ntheir study of variation among schoolchildren ages 14 and 15 from north and west\nLondon (the working class and middle class informants came from different parts\nof London, and the middle class girls were drawn from two different schools, so a\ndirect comparison based only on class is problematic). It must be noted that the\nauthors used recordings of speakers describing events shown in a series of\npictures, so the speech is not likely to represent the most casual style. In\naddition, only 3\u20134 min of speech were recorded per informant. They found a\ngreater use of shifted variants for MOUTH, GOAT, and FACE among the working\nclass speakers than middle class speakers. The results for PRICE are not\nquantified, but they report shifted qualities of the [\u0251\u00a8\u026a] type and also a\nmonophthongal realization [\u0251\u00a8\u02d0]. Working class boys and girls used the most\nshifted variants for FACE and MOUTH. These variants were [\u025b\u02d5\u00a8\u026a] and [\u025b\u02d5\u00a8] for FACE\nand [\u00e6\u02d0] and [\u00e6\u0264\u00a8] for MOUTH. Middle class speakers used variants similar to RP\nrealizations. For FACE, the working class boys used the most shifted variants 92%\nof the time. Working class girls used the shifted variant [\u025b\u02d5\u00a8\u026a] 38% of the time and\nthe more close, and RP-like, variant [\u025b\u02d4\u00a8\u026a] 39% of the time. Middle class speakers\ngenerally used [\u025b\u02d4\u00a8\u026a] and [e\u02d5\u026a]. For MOUTH, the distribution among working class\nboys was [\u00e6\u0264\u00a8] 84% and [\u00e6\u02d0] 13%. Working class girls used [\u00e6\u0264\u00a8] (83%) and the\nmore open variant [a\u02d0] (13%). Middle class speakers used the RP-like variant\n[\u0251\u00a8\u028a]: boys used it 79% of the time and girls used it 15% and 33% of the time\n(depending on which of the two schools they came from). However, the [\u00e6\u0264\u00a8]\nvariant was the most frequent among middle class girls (62% and 42%,\nrespectively). GOAT has [\u028c\u0264\u00a8] (the [\u028c] symbol is used by the authors to describe a\nfront-centralized open vowel in the region of [\u0250\u02d5\u00fe]) as the most frequent variant\namong working class boys (80%), followed by a variant with an even fronter\nonset, [\u00e6\u00a8\u0264\u00a8] (14%). The working class girls also have [\u028c\u0264\u00a8] as the most frequent\nvariant (72%), followed by [\u01dd\u028a] (16%). This latter variant is also the most\nfrequent with middle class boys (62%) and the two groups of middle class girls\n(51% and 46%). Middle class girls use a variant with an extremely fronted\nonset, [\u025b\u02d4\u028a], 30% and 16% of the time. The authors stated that this variant is\n\u201cconfined to the middle class and historically associated with Advanced RP\u201d\n(Hudson & Holloway, 1977:18).\nTollfree (1999) found shifted diphthongs among working class informants (her\nSouth East London English speakers). She gave [\u00e6\u02d0]\u223c[\u025b\u02d0] for MOUTH, where the first\nvariant may have an [\u028a] offglide. The younger speakers may havemore open onsets,\n[a\u028a] or [a\u0264]. PRICE typically has [\u0251) \u026a], but the second element can be centralized or\naltogether lacking. She found no age differences for this vowel. GOAT has [\u028c\u028a],\n[\u028c\u0264], and [\u0250\u0264]. FACE has [a\u02d4\u026a] or even more open [a\u026a], which may be slightly\nrounded [a) \u026a]. She also examined the speech of middle class speakers, who had\nnear-RP qualities for all the diphthongs\u2014that is, with hardly any shifting at all.\nLabov, Sivertsen, Hurford, Beaken, Hudson and Holloway, and Tollfree all\nfound shifted diphthongs in their studies in London, with the exception of some\n460 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nof Tollfree\u2019s younger speakers for MOUTH and some of Hurford\u2019s younger speakers\nfor PRICE. If the process of Diphthong Shift is continuing in London, onewould then\nexpect all speakers, especially younger ones, in the diphthong-shifting area to have\nthese or very similar vowel qualities\u2014and indeed to have even more shifted\nvowels. This turns out not to be the case, as we shall discuss.\nRecent developments in diphthongs in south-east England\nPrevious work in Reading and Milton Keynes shows a movement away from the\nshifted qualities toward RP-like qualities (Kerswill & Williams, 2005), similar to\nthe ones Tollfree (1999) noted for her middle class South East London Regional\nStandard speakers. This process goes against the notion of drift: if there is a\npropensity to develop shifted vowels, one does not expect nonshifted variants to\nappear in young speakers. For MOUTH, there is a replacement of both rural and urban\nlocal forms by an RP-like [a\u028a]. The development is shown in Tables 1 and 2. The\nchange in urban areas is from a fronted [\u025b\u028a] to an RP-like quality. The change in\nrural areas is from a raised, central [\u025b\u02d4\u00a8\u028a\u00fe ], again to the RP-like quality. Figure 5\nshows acoustic measurements of MOUTH vowels in the SED recording of\nSwallowfield, just south of Reading. Two of four onsets are centralized, and two\nof them are open. This indicates variation in the realization of this vowel,\ndoubtless stylistically determined and indicative of change even in the 1950s.\nTABLE 1.

It is not,\nhowever, the result of leveling toward the majority variant, because the apparent\nRP-like target is a minority realization in the southeast. We can speculate that\nthe process is a move away from individual regionally marked forms (both urban\nand rural) to a socially and regionally more neutral variant\u2014a case of\nnonlinguistic factors propelling change. This process is apparently a reversal of\nDiphthong Shift: the shift from [\u025b\u028a\u00fe ] to [a\u028a] goes in the opposite direction to the\nclockwise shift discussed by Wells (1982)\u2014always assuming, of course, that\n[a\u028a] was the starting point, which as we have seen is an unlikely scenario.\nFor PRICE, we can observe the replacement of the widely stereotyped [\u0254\u026a] by a\nregionally and socially unmarked\u2014and probably more urban\u2014[\u0251\u00fe \u026a]\u223c[\u0251\u026a]. Tables 3\nand 4 show the distribution across age and gender groups. We can notice that the\nchange is faster in Milton Keynes than in Reading, probably due to the presence of\nless close-knit social networks in Milton Keynes than in Reading. If we take\nWells\u2019s (1982) account at face value, the shift is easy to see as a reversal of\nDiphthong Shift: the change observed reverses the development that we assume\nhappened in the past. However, we argue, with Britain (2005), that the trajectory of\nchange might not have encompassed a stage with an open-mid onset. Instead, the\nchange seems to us to have been as follows: [\u0259\u026a]\u2192 [\u0254\u026a]\u2192 [\u0252\u026a]\u2192 [\u0251\u026a]\u2192 [\u0251\u00fe \u026a], with\nthe social motivation provided by an avoidance of local and stereotyped or\nstereotypable forms, in the same manner as we argue for the introduction of an RP\nquality for MOUTH.\nAccording to Williams and Kerswill (1999), Milton Keynes shows stability in\nFACE\u2014working class speakers have a broad diphthong close to [\u00e6\u2010\u026a] or [\u0250\u026a],\nwhereas middle class speakers are likely to use [e\u02d5\u026a] (the RP variant). Acoustic\nmeasurements of data from Reading show a similar or slightly lesser degree\nDiphthong Shift for FACE compared with Milton Keynes (see Figure 7).\nFIGURE 5. MOUTH vowels in Swallowfield (SED).\n462 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nAnother development is the fronting of the offset of GOAT (Kerswill &Williams,\n2005). Unlike changes in MOUTH, PRICE, and FACE, this is not a matter of dialect\nleveling or neutralization, but the shared adoption of a new variant. Figure 6\nshows the start and end points of several tokens in the speech of a representative\nelderly man in Reading. He has a lowered onset, typical of the shifted GOAT\nvowel. The offset is not fronted. The boy shown in Figure 7 illustrates the\nfronting: there is little change in the onset but the offset is clearly fronted. GOAT-\nfronting, not really a part of Diphthong Shift, has been present in London for a\nwhile, as observed by Hurford (1967) and Beaken (1971).\nD I P H T H O N G S I N LO N D O N TO D AY\nGiven recent interest in the processes of dialect supralocalization and innovation in\nBritish dialectology (e.g., papers in Foulkes & Docherty, 1999; Milroy, 2002;\nKerswill, 2003) and Wells\u2019s (1982:301) assertion that London is the source of\ninnovation in British English, it is of the utmost relevance to discover the\nrelationship between the changes discussed earlier and the present-day speech of\nyoung people in the capital. The questions are: (a) Are the older changes in\nLondon still ongoing there, that is, have they in some sense progressed further?\n(b) Is there evidence that features that appear to have started in London have\nactually diffused from there to other places in the southeast, such as Reading and\nMilton Keynes? (c) Are there changes outside London that are not found in the\ncity itself? Two recent projects enable us to begin to answer these questions.\nTABLE 4.

There,\nshe found a similar, more extreme move away from the shifted qualities in PRICE\nand FACE (she did not study other vowels). The young speakers as a whole largely\nused the diphthongs [a\u026a] and [\u0250\u026a] in PRICE, where the offsets might be weakened\nto [\u025b] or even zero, a monophthongal variant [\u00e6] and also diphthong-shifted\nqualities such as [\u0251\u026a]. The elderly speakers had only the traditional shifted\nqualities [\u0251\u02d4], [\u0251\u026a], and [\u0251\u02d0]. In particular, the young speakers of Bangladeshi\norigin used the unshifted variants. The young white British speakers also had a\nlarge proportion of [\u0251\u026a]. The white British boys, of whom many mixed with\nthe Bangladeshi boys, had a greater proportion of the unshifted variant than the\nwhite girls did. There was a similar distribution of the variants of FACE. The\nyoung speakers had [e\u02d4\u026a], [e\u026a], and [\u025b\u026a], sometimes with monophthongal qualities.\nHere, the speakers of Bangladeshi origin had a greater proportion of the most\nunshifted variants. Again, it was the white British boys who had more of the\nnonshifted variants than the white girls did. The elderly speakers had the shifted\nqualities [\u00e6\u026a] and [a\u026a]. Among the young speakers, it was the speakers aged 15\nand younger who had the most unshifted qualities. The most frequent variant\namong all young speakers was the RP-like [\u025b\u026a], which was interpreted as leveling\nor accommodation between speakers of different ethnicities. According to Fox\n(2007:276), the innovative unshifted qualities for both PRICE and FACE possibly\nhave their origin in contact with both Bengali Sylheti (which does not have\ndiphthongs) and L2 English, as well as the London Bangladeshis\u2019 relative\nisolation from other ethnic groups. What is clear is that the unshifting of PRICE\nand FACE is led by the Bangladeshi speakers and, among white young people, boys.\nFIGURE 6.

The localities were selected on the basis of demographic and social\ndifferences: Hackney is ethnically very diverse and economically relatively\ndeprived, and Havering is an area with higher mobility and higher levels of\nprosperity. Hackney is in the traditional East End. Havering is on the eastern\nedge of London, formerly a part of Essex, but now administratively a London\nborough. The localities are shown in Figure 8.\nSpeakers\nTwo age groups were sampled. The older informants are in their 70s and 80s and\ncome from local families. There are four women and four men in each group.\nThe young informants are 16\u201319 (the majority were 17) years old and were\nrecruited at local colleges. In Hackney, half of our young informants have a\n\u201cwhite London\u201d background; that is, their families have relatively local roots\n(Anglo). The other half are the children or grandchildren of immigrants, almost\nall from developing countries (non-Anglo). The young speakers in Havering are\nAnglo, with a few exceptions; this reflects the ethnic distribution in the borough.\nWe also included some speakers who attended college in Havering but who\ncommuted daily from other boroughs. Table 5 shows a breakdown of the\nspeakers. The commuters are listed after the \u00fe symbol.\nFIGURE 7. Male born 1981, Reading (recorded 1996).\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 465\nMeasurements\nAll recordings were made with a Marantz solid state recorder using a 48,000-Hz\nsampling rate at 16-bit resolution. All sound files were downsampled to 11,025 Hz\nto allow for acoustic analysis. F1 (first formant) measurements, representing vowel\nheight, and F2 (second formant) measurements, representing vowel front=backness,\nwere taken at two measurement points using the PRAAT phonetic analysis program.\nThese were steady state areas on the spectrogram as far away as possible from the\ninfluence of surrounding segments for both the onset and the offset of the\ndiphthongs. In the remaining diagrams, the measurements are presented as mean\nvalues of several observations for each vowel, excluding preceding or following\nnasal or liquid environments, for individual speakers. All the component vowels of\ndiphthong shift were analyzed. FLEECE and GOOSE in our data are mainly near-\nmonophthongs\u2014that is, reversed. We found very few tokens with an [\u0259\u0289] quality\nfor GOOSE, especially in Hackney. Formant analysis of the nucleus shows a close\nvowel, without a central onset. The same was found for FLEECE, though this vowel\nFIGURE 8. Map of London (fromwww.cityoflondon.gov.uk\/Corporation\/maps\/london_map.\nhtm).\nTABLE 5.

The total number of tokens analyzed for each speaker ranges from\n20 for the most frequent vowels down to 5 for the least frequent vowels, giving a total\nof about 4500. For each vowel, wewill refer to the location of the start and end points\nof the formant trajectories in relation to other vowels in the speaker\u2019s system, and not\nto specific hertz values. The plots below represent mean F1 and F2 values for the\nonsets and offsets of the tokens of each diphthong.\nStatistical analysis\nRaw formant data were normalized using the Lobanov metric (Lobanov, 1971).\nThe monophthong data for all speakers (Torgersen, Kerswill, & Fox, 2006) were\nincluded in this calculation. Multivariate ANOVAs were then carried out on the\nmean F1 and F2 onsets and offsets for each diphthong.\nH AC K N E Y\nTables 6 and 7 present summary information on significant effects in Hackney. The\nstatistical testing confirms the Diphthong Shift reversal found in London by Fox\n(2007) and the findings of Kerswill and Williams (2005) in Reading and Milton\nKeynes. MOUTH shows an effect of age ( p, 0.001). There is centralization\n( p, 0.001) and lowering ( p, 0.001) of the onset for young speakers. The\ngirls have a more open ( p, 0.001) and more back ( p, 0.05) onset than the\nboys, suggesting a female-led change. The non-Anglo speakers have a more\nback onset than the Anglo speakers ( p, 0.05). PRICE shows a significant effect\nof age ( p, 0.001), with fronting ( p, 0.001) and lowering ( p, 0.001) of the\nonset for young speakers compared with the elderly speakers. There is also an\nTABLE 7.

All these findings are in line with\nFox\u2019s findings for Tower Hamlets. For the onset of GOAT, there is no overall effect of\nage, but ethnicity is significant. The non-Anglo speakers have a more raised onset\ncompared with the Anglo speakers ( p, 0.05), and the Anglo speakers have a more\nfronted offset than the non-Anglo speakers ( p, 0.05). Girls have a more fronted\noffset than boys do, but the difference is not significant ( p \u00bc 0.08). FACE\nalso shows an effect of age ( p, 0.001). The young speakers have a less open\n( p, 0.001) and more front ( p, 0.001) onset. Boys have a less open onset\nthan girls do ( p, 0.001), suggesting this time a male-led change. The non-\nAnglo speakers have a less open ( p, 0.001) and more front ( p, 0.005) onset\nthan the Anglo speakers do\u2014a finding that, when combined with results for age,\nindicates it may be non-Anglo boys who are in the lead in the change\u2014a finding\nconsonant with Fox\u2019s. Here we also have an effect of friendship network:\nnon-Anglo speakers have a more fronted onset than do Anglo speakers with a\nlargely Anglo friendship network (less than 40% multiethnic friendship\nnetwork) ( p, 0.05), but not Anglo speakers with a largely non-Anglo\nfriendship network (more than 40% multiethnic friendship network)\u2014again, a\nfinding that parallels that for Fox\u2019s Anglo boys. In sum, the development is\ntoward nonshifted diphthong qualities in MOUTH, PRICE, and FACE.\nIn Figures 9\u201325, we provide vowel plots for representative speakers (boys and\ngirls, Anglo and non-Anglo). The plots show the diphthong trajectories and also\nthe monophthongs DRESS, TRAP, STRUT, FOOT, and START. As can be seen in these\ndiagrams, acoustic measurements of monophthongs for young and elderly\nspeakers in London show great stability for START but backing for TRAP and\nbacking and raising of STRUT (Figures 3 and 4; Torgersen, Kerswill, & Fox,\nFIGURE 9. Jack, Anglo, Hackney.\n468 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\n2006). The formant frequencies shown are the normalized, mean values measured\nfor each speaker. Notice in particular the vowels where Diphthong Shift reversal is\nmost straightforward to see: MOUTH in relation to DRESS and TRAP (lowering and\nbacking), the onset of PRICE in relation to START (lowering), and the onset of GOAT\nin relation to STRUT (raising).\nAnglo speakers: Boys\nHere we present vowel plots for five speakers. The two boys shown in Figures 9\nand 10 have a majority of white friends. Jack (Figure 9) and Andrew (Figure 10)\nhave a diphthong-shifted PRICE, which sits above and behind START, as also seen\namong the elderly speakers in Hackney presented earlier. However, there is a\nslight Diphthong Shift reversal, as the onset of FACE is less open (again\ncompared with the elderly speakers). MOUTH is moving back (and for Jack also\ndown); however, it is keeping its monophthongal quality and so is not\nconverging with the RP-like [a\u028a] of Reading and Milton Keynes. GOAT is not\nfronted, as reported in Milton Keynes and elsewhere in the southeast, but the\nonset is becoming less open.\nFigures 11\u201313 show three mixed race and Anglo speakers who have networks\nwith a high proportion of black friends and an interest in garage, grime, and hip-\nhop music. These speakers are Mark (mixed race Afro-Caribbean=white British;\nFigure 11), Gary (Anglo; Figure 12), and Dave (Anglo; Figure 13). We can note\nDiphthong Shift reversal for all vowels, but the onset of FACE is more raised\n(in terms of his vowel system) for Mark than it is for Jack and Andrew. For all\nthree speakers the onset of PRICE is well in front of START, the offset of GOAT is\nfronted (the vowel stays nonfronted with Gary), and MOUTH is backed and\nlowered. The onset of GOAT is raised and backed. Notice how STRUT is more\nFIGURE 10. Andrew, Anglo, Hackney.\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 469\nraised in relation to START than for the two boys with a majority of white friends.\nPRICE is clearly moving away from a position above and behind START to a more\ncentral position, either being lowered or raised.\nAnglo speakers: Girls\nThe three Hackney Anglo girls shown in Figures 14\u201316 have some features in\ncommon: the offset of GOAT is fronted and MOUTH (the onset has a higher F1 than\nFIGURE 12.

Laura (Figure 16) has\nslightly different PRICE and FACE vowels than the other two girls, possibly\nreflecting her more multiethnic network. Her PRICE onset is more fronted than\nDanielle\u2019s (Figure 14) or Claire\u2019s (Figure 15).

Compared with the Anglo boys in\nHackney, all diphthongs have shorter trajectories. The difference is most marked\nfor FACE, which has a raised onset. The onset of PRICE is fronted in relation to\nSTART, as seen with the Anglo boys with a multiethnic network. MOUTH (starting\npoint is with higher F1) is lowered and backed in relation to TRAP. Brian\n(Figure 17) and Alan (Figure 19) have a monophthongal quality for this vowel,\nwhereas Grant (Figure 20), Chris (Figure 18), and Rashid (Figure 21) have a\ndiphthong in the region of [\u0251\u028a]\u2014a backer variant than the RP-like pronunciations\nin the southeast.

Thus, the\nHavering speakers are more conservative in the realization of this vowel (i.e., the\nyoung speakers in Havering are more like the elderly speakers in Hackney than\nare the young speakers in Hackney in the production of MOUTH). The onset of\nGOAT is quite open. The offset of GOAT may be slightly fronted, but not so much\nas the quality found in Milton Keynes (Kerswill & Williams, 2005).\nTABLE 8.

MOUTH is backing among the young speakers in\nrelation to the elderly speakers, and the onset of FACE is rising. PRICE is moving\nto the front, but not so much as in Hackney, indicating a greater degree of\nDiphthong Shift in Havering. The offset of GOAT is fronted, as seen in Milton\nKeynes, but the onset is not as raised as in Hackney. Non-Anglo speakers in\nHavering use the backed monophthongal variant of GOAT, but the absence of an\noverall significant effect of age for raising and backing indicates more\nDiphthong Shift than in Hackney.\nFIGURE 31.

This is largely the system described by Wells\n(1982) with diphthong-shifted vowels. If we accept the drift argument in\naccounting for the developments in the production of diphthongs in New\nZealand, we would expect a further, parallel development in the same vowels in\nLondon. This turns out not to be the case. In some ways, London is in line with\nthe rest of southeast England where RP-like diphthongs and shared new variants\nhave been found (i.e., a movement away from the shifted diphthongs previously\nfound across much of the area). However, London also appears to have\ndeveloped new diphthong variants, and indeed new monophthongs, that are\ndifferent from those found elsewhere in the region. The main developments are\nas follows.\nMOUTH is backed to a low-centralized near monophthong for all speakers. There is\nlittle sign of the leveled southeastern RP-like [a\u028a], though the onset is becomingmore\nlike the starting point of this variant. Girls in Hackney often have an [\u0251\u028a] quality for\nthis vowel, demonstrating backing, but not monophthongization. PRICE shows\nfronting and lowering of the onset among both Hackney and some Havering\nyouth. This is a reversal of Diphthong Shift if we buy into the theory that the back\nopen-mid onset developed from a low mid onset\u2014for which, as we have seen,\nthere is little evidence. It represents a further increase in what we would now\ninterpret as the same move toward a fully open onset in the southeast \u201cperiphery\u201d\ntowns of Reading and Milton Keynes revealed by the figures in Tables 3 and 4.\nPRICE is also often a near monophthong among Hackney young people, especially\nthe non-Anglo speakers. FACE shows a reversal of Diphthong Shift to a front\nclosing diphthong; this is seen most strongly among the non-Anglos. In this case,\nFIGURE 33. Traditional London diphthong system with shifted diphthongs.\n482 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nwe are probably dealing with a genuine reversal. Although the rather open onsets of\nour elderly London speakers are also found in much of the rural south toward the end\nof the 19th century (see earlier presentation of Ellis\u2019s 1889 data), they were not\nuniversal (to judge from data provided in Britain [2005:177\u2013179]) and existed\nalongside more raised variants, which are assumed to be older. We have already\nseen how the lowering of FACE continued in New Zealand to a greater extent than\npredicted by the input variants. GOAT has two highly divergent variant\npronunciations. The first is the new fronted offset (the \u201cMilton Keynes\u201d variant).\nThis is more common in Havering than Hackney and more often found among\ngirls than boys. The other variant is a back close near monophthong, which is\nfound mainly, but not exclusively, among non-Anglo boys and girls in Hackney.\nExamination of Euclidean distances reveals that the elderly speakers in both\nHackney and Havering are always among those with the longest trajectories from\nonset to offset in the diphthongs. The non-Anglo speakers are always among the\nspeakers with the shortest trajectories. This shows the difference between elderly\nand young speakers and between Anglo and non-Anglo speakers: the young\nspeakers are producing diphthongs with shorter trajectories, and the non-Anglo\nspeakers are in the lead in the monophthongization process.\nTable 10 summarizes the main processes involved in the diphthongs in inner\nLondon.\nFigure 34 shows the main elements of the emergent diphthong system in\nLondon. For all diphthongs (except MOUTH, which is generally monophthongal\nanyway), the main processes involve (a) shorter trajectories for FACE, GOAT, and\nPRICE and (b) lowering and centralization of MOUTH and PRICE. For these\nprocesses, we can use the label Diphthong Shift reversal without necessarily\naccepting the diachronic ramifications of this term. In addition, GOAT has two\ndifferent realizations: either the fronted variant (labeled a) or the backed variant\n(labeled b). Finally, there is a new, back variant of MOUTH, [\u0251\u028a], not covered by\nthe two processes given above.\nThe monophthongization of PRICE, GOAT, and FACE seems to be correlated with\nfour interacting scales. The first of these is ethnicity. The speakers of Afro-\nCaribbean heritage (Brian and Chris) have the shortest trajectories, which mean\nthat they are in the lead in the reversal of Diphthong Shift. They are followed\nby speakers of other non-Anglo origins (Rashid and Alan) and then the\nAnglo speakers. The second scale is the ethnicity of the friendship group: Anglo\nspeakers with a largely multiethnic friendship network (Gary, Dale, and Laura)\nhave more advanced Diphthong Shift reversal than those without such a network\nTABLE 10.

The third scale is gender. Male\nnon-Anglo speakers from Hackney seem to have more extreme Diphthong Shift\nreversal than the females. The fourth scale is geographical location in relation to\ninner London. The Hackney speakers are clearly more advanced in the reversal\nof Diphthong Shift than those from Havering. The tables displaying data for\nMOUTH and PRICE from Reading and Milton Keynes show use of shifted variants\naround 15% of the time for 14 and 15 year olds, placing these peripheral\nlocalities together with Havering. The new, leveled variants ([\u0259\u028f] in GOAT, [a\u028a] in\nMOUTH, and [\u0251\u00fe \u026a] in PRICE) are found more in the southeast periphery and among\ngirls in outer London, apart from MOUTH, which has a monophthongal quality in\nboth Hackney and Havering. The leveled variants are rare in inner London, and\nthe innovative back [\u0251\u028a] in MOUTH may be used by non-Anglo girls in inner London.\nThe fronted qualities for PRICE, the raising of FACE, the raising and backing of\nGOAT, and the backing and lowering of MOUTH represent a more radical move\naway from the earlier diphthong-shifted variants by comparison with Reading\nand Milton Keynes, which have intermediate qualities. This suggests that\nDiphthong Shift reversal is more advanced in London than in the southeast\nperiphery.\nDevelopments in London and the southeast, then, run counter to the idea of drift\u2014\nthe diphthongs are getting less, not more shifted. The reason behind this is likely to be\ndialect contact (with other varieties of English than British), language contact, and\ncontact with L2 Englishes. This leads to innovation and hence divergence in\nLondon. The changes found in the periphery (e.g., in Reading and Milton Keynes)\nbut not in inner London, especially GOAT fronting, are therefore not interpretable as\ndiffusing from inner London\u2014a point we will return to.\nFIGURE 34. Emergent London diphthong system with unshifted diphthongs and monophthon-\ngal qualities.\n484 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nDifferences in the realization of diphthongs between speakers of different\nethnicities have also been found elsewhere. Horvath (1985) studied the English of\nimmigrants in Sydney in Australia and found that immigrant teenagers of Greek\nand Italian origin used less broad (i.e., less shifted) Australian English diphthongs\nthan Anglo teenagers. This finding was interpreted as a reversal of a chain shift\n(Horvath, 1985:94). As a result, the immigrant teenagers seemed to be\nspearheading change\u2014in this case away from heavily shifted qualities toward\nmore \u201ccultivated,\u201d less shifted qualities. Thus, the teenagers differentiated\nthemselves from their immigrant parents, who had more shifted qualities. This was\ninterpreted as a movement away from low-prestige variants, which were associated\nwith migrants generally and their parents specifically, to achieve native status.\nThis explanation is not suitable for our London data, where the young non-Anglo\nspeakers use new, near-monophthongal qualities that are remote from local\nsoutheastern vernaculars and from varieties close to RP. Our results resemble\ninstead those of Fox (2007) in Tower Hamlets and those in another large city in\nthe U.K. In Khan\u2019s (2006) study of PRICE and GOAT in Birmingham, the older\ninformants used traditional diphthong-shifted variants for PRICE ([\u0251\u026a] and [\u0254\u026a]) and\nGOAT ([\u028c\u028a] and [\u0250\u028a]), whereas young speakers frequently use [a\u2010\u026a] for PRICE and\n[\u01dd\u028a], [o\u02d0], and [\u0254\u028a] for GOAT. The use of [a\u2010\u026a] for PRICE is clearly a reversal of\nDiphthong Shift, as is the increased use of [\u01dd\u028a] in GOAT among the young male\nspeakers. Differences are observed between speakers of white British, Pakistani,\nand Caribbean backgrounds. Whereas the white British young speakers favor the\nnon-localized and nonshifted variants for GOAT, which is interpreted as dialect\nleveling, Pakistani and Caribbean speakers use the backed and monophthongal\nvariants [\u0254\u028a] and [o\u02d0]. White British teenagers use [\u0251\u026a] for PRICE, but less than the\nelderly speakers, and the nonshifted [a\u2010\u026a] and [\u00e4\u026a]. The Pakistani and Caribbean\nteenagers use little [\u0251\u026a], preferring [a\u2010\u026a] and [\u00e4\u026a]. Khan argues that [o\u02d0] is an\ninnovative variant with roots in the Pakistani and Caribbean communities. The\nchanges in Birmingham are seen by Khan as generated within the city, the use of\nthese variants being a marker of ethnic orientation, which is a sensitive variable\nfor the Pakistani and Caribbean speakers but not for the white British.\nThere are striking parallels with the findings in London: the back variants for\nGOAT and fronted onsets for PRICE are typical of non-Anglo speakers in both\nLondon and Birmingham. We then get a series of young people\u2019s Englishes that\nare predicted by heritage, ethnicity, and friendship network. We need to\ninvestigate the causes of these parallel developments in London and\nBirmingham (and probably other large cities such as Manchester). These could\nbe parallel developments caused by a similar dialect mixture (phonetically\nsimilar diphthongs in London and Birmingham coupled with similar mixes of\nrecent immigrant speech varieties), or else there could be contact between\npeople, particularly of immigrant origin, between cities.\nWhere do the monophthongal qualities come from? Szmrecsanyi and Kortmann\n(forthcoming) have carried out a statistical analysis of several grammatical features\nin different varieties of English. They found that L2 Englishes are less\nmorphosyntactically complex than L1 English vernaculars. English creoles and\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 485\npidgins are even less complex. Is it therefore the case that L2 Englishes also favor less\ncomplex vowel systems?Learner varieties of Englishmay use amonophthong for FACE\nif the first language does not have a comparable diphthong (Flege, Schirru,&MacKay,\n2003), as do most \u201couter circle\u201d (Kachru, 1986) varieties for both FACE and GOAT, such\nasWest and East African, Indian, andWest Indian Englishes (Wells, 1982). In parts of\ninner London, they may have been adopted in the first place because they were in a\nnumerical majority, after which they spread through social networks involving\nnonminority ethnic people for whom the new variants represent a positive social\nidentity (cf. Le Page & Tabouret-Keller, 1985). Fox (2007) explained the frequent\nuse of near-monophthongal qualities of PRICE and FACE among young speakers in\nTower Hamlets in this way.\nOur data is a demonstration of the influence of nonlinguistic factors on what is\nnormally held to be a \u201cnatural\u201d or quasi-universal process or \u201cprinciple.\u201d As Labov\n(1994:140) stated, such factors have the power to override linguistic constraints, at\nleast in vowels shifts. In this article, as well as in our previous work (Torgersen &\nKerswill, 2004), we have been able to add a good deal of precision to this claim.\nDrift is not negated by our work. The contrast between London and the southeast\non the one hand and New Zealand on the other in a sense strengthens the claims\nmade for drift. Since the second half of the last century, London and the southeast\nhave been characterized by a great increase both in geographical mobility and by\nimmigration. Mobility across the region has led to dialect leveling (dialect\nsupralocalization, in the words of Milroy, Milroy, & Hartley, 1994), and\nimmigration to London and (we can speculate) a strong sense of ethnic identity has\nled not to leveling, but to innovation, led by the second generation of new\nimmigrants. In the wider southeast, leveling tendencies lead to the replacement of\ndiphthong-shifted variants by a series of new forms, characterized by their lack of\nboth regional and social marking. In inner London, diphthong-shifted variants are\nousted not so much by these neutral forms as by new, often socially and ethnically\nmarked variants generated from the ethnic mix. For New Zealand, the critical\nperiod for Diphthong Shift is not the present time, but the formation of the new\nvariety itself from 1850 onward (Trudgill, 2004). As we have seen, shifted variants\ndominated, and (Trudgill argued) the lesser degree of social stigma attached to the\nshifted variants, at least in the early period and certainly for the first generation of\nchildren growing up, gave the Diphthong Shift changes free reign, enabling them\nto be phonetically accentuated in relation even to the input varieties. None of this\nis true of the English southeast right now: powerful and extremely varied social\nforces are at play in reversing the process.\nI N N OVAT I O N , L E V E L I N G , A N D T H E M E T RO P O L I S\nThe inner city\u2013driven phonetic changes we have described are far-reaching and rapid\nand are to a more limited extent paralleled by morphosyntactic changes (Cheshire &\nFox, 2007). We now ask the question of how these fit into the overall patterns of\nchange in Great Britain. The current debate concerns the definitions and relative\n486 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nimportance of (dialect) leveling, supralocalization, diffusion, and dedialectalization.\nWilliams and Kerswill defined dialect leveling as follows:\ndialect levelling and by extension accent levelling, a process whereby differences\nbetween regional varieties are reduced, features which make varieties distinctive\ndisappear, and new features emerge and are adopted by speakers over a wide\ngeographical area (1999:149)\nThe limitation of this proposal is that it does not deal with the sources, the\nmechanisms, or the motivations of the changes. Sources can be endogenous\ninnovation (driven by language-internal factors) or else borrowing from prestige\nvarieties, from standard\/literate varieties, from neighboring varieties, or from in-\nmigrant varieties. Mechanisms are, again, innovation (coinciding in this case with\na source), mutual accommodation following long-term dialect contact, one-sided\nconvergence with other speaker groups who may or may not be in contact with\nthe speakers, and divergence from such groups. Subsumed under mechanisms are\ntwo geographical factors: geographical (directional) diffusion (Britain, 2002;\nKerswill, 2003) and mutual leveling (Kerswill, 2003), by which speakers in a\ngeographically delimited high-contact area have the opportunity to accommodate\nto each other, most obviously in a new town such as Milton Keynes (Kerswill &\nWilliams, 2000). Motivations vary from place to place and time to time, but\nmany can be subsumed under identity (Le Page & Tabouret-Keller, 1985). In\nBritain, the avoidance of a local and old-fashioned identity is said to lead to one\nof the leveling changes in northeast England, the abandonment of the local\ndiphthong [\u026a\u0259] in FACE in favor of a general northern [e\u02d0] (Watt, 2002). Greater\nmobility and the loss of dense social networks lead to new, less localized\nidentities and concomitant dialect\/accent supralocalization (Milroy, 2002), which\nis close to the definition of dialect leveling given above. At the same time,\nBritish dialects have been subject to dedialectalisation, by which the distribution\nof phonemes across the lexicon comes to fall in line with Standard English\u2014a\nprocess that, according to Maguire (2007), has been underway for over 150 years.\nKerswill (2003) and Trudgill (1999) argued that most of the nonstandard\nphonological changes in British English, in particular TH-fronting (the use of [f]\nfor =\u03b8= and [v] for noninitial =\u00f0=) are spreading by geographical diffusion, not by\nleveling\u2014which would imply the simultaneous adoption throughout the area. At\nthe same time, it was assumed that London was for the most part the origin of\nthese changes, and indeed, the evidence for a London origin for TH-fronting is\ncompelling despite its cropping up sporadically in other places. With the data\npresented here, we are in a position to provide much more detail, and the results\nare surprising.We take each of the Diphthong Shift vowels we have analyzed in turn.\nMOUTH\nIn inner London (Hackney), the vowel is lowered from a mid-front position, but\nremains a monophthong. A second, very distinct variant is a back diphthong\nR E V E R S I N G \u201c D R I F T \u201d I N LO N D ON D I P H T H O NG S 487\n[\u0251\u028a]. In outer London (Havering), the same lowering applies, but less strongly. In\nthe southeast periphery (Reading, Milton Keynes), all of these variants are very\nrare; instead, the RP-like realization [a\u028a] has made inroads. All the new variants\nshare the feature lowering, suggesting a common origin. However, the phonetic\ndifferences are striking and nearly categorical between speaker groups. This\nsuggests there are two discrete innovations in inner London, full lowering and\nbacking\/diphthongization, which have not (yet) diffused out. The southeast\nperiphery variant [a\u028a], which is not shared by any of our London speakers,\nseems to be the result of the selection of a nonlocal variant and not of dialect\nleveling (in Trudgill\u2019s [2004] sense of majority features winning out), because it\nis not found as a vernacular variant anywhere in the southeast. The success of\n[a\u028a] seems to be an example of supralocalization, albeit different from the\nexpansion of [e\u02d0] for FACE in the northeast in that it is not the adoption of a\nmajority variant, but rather one that is socially unmarked.\nPRICE\nIn inner London, PRICE has changed from having an open-mid rounded onset to a\nfully open central onset with variable monophthongization with non-Anglo\nspeakers in the lead. As with MOUTH, the same process is observed in outer\nLondon, but not so strongly, and the old variant is preserved by a few speakers.\nIn the periphery, open, but fully back onsets are the norm, with no\nmonophthongization. The changes in PRICE follow a single track, following the\nordered processes of lowering, fronting, and monophthongization, and the\ngeographical spread is very much as predicted by the diffusion model. However,\nas with [a\u028a] for MOUTH, it is doubtless helped by the fact that it resembles an RP\nvariant.\nFACE\nAs discussed earlier, FACE seems to be the only genuine example of Diphthong Shift\nreversal. Inner London has changed from a diphthong with an open-mid onset [\u025b\u026a]\nto a narrow diphthong [e\u02d5\u026a] or [e\u02d4\u026a] with non-Anglo speakers leading, a change that is\nfound to a lesser extent in outer London and the periphery. This again seems a clear\ncase of diffusion.\nGOAT\nMany inner London speakers, particularly but not exclusively non-Anglos, have\nstrongly raised and back onsets, giving the impression of a close-mid back\nmonophthong. Outside inner London, this variant is probably mostly used by\nnon-Anglos. Outer London has some onset raising, but generally preserves a\ncentral diphthong with a long trajectory. In outer London, there is also some\nfronting of the offset (GOAT fronting), a feature that is, however, a very strong,\nfemale-led change in the periphery. There is a relationship between all these\nvariants in that they all have raised onsets when compared with elderly speakers.\n488 PA U L K E R SW I L L , E I V I N D N E S S A TO R G E R S E N A N D S U S A N FO X\nHowever, we must recognize two recent, discrete, phonetically diverging\nprocesses: backing\/raising and offset fronting. Backing\/raising is an inner city\ninnovation, very much associated with non-Anglo speakers. So far, it has not\nspread to the mainstream of the southeastern population, except to those Anglos\nwho have ethnically mixed networks. Offset fronting, however, is widely found\nin the southeast among both working class and middle class speakers (Cheshire,\net al., 1999). Offset fronting shares with the use of [a\u028a] for MOUTH the fact that it\nseems to have appeared throughout the southeast simultaneously, without\ninvolving (inner) London. Unlike the MOUTH variant, it cannot be ascribed to a\nprestigious, or at least nonlocalizable variety and, unlike it, too, it attracts mild\nopprobrium in the media. However, it is clearly now a supralocal variant, but\nwith a different origin from [a\u028a] for MOUTH.\nThe picture that has emerged is of high complexity, yet the outlines of dialect\nchange remain intact: innovation, diffusion, and supralocalization all play a part,\ncoupled with links that can be made to social parameters (and that have barely\nbeen explored in this article). Studying dialect change in a metropolis such as\nLondon is, however, of extreme importance to the understanding of the overall\ndynamic of linguistic change in contemporary Western societies. Metropolises\ndo not look to other, larger cities within their geographical territories for\ninfluences. They are at the apex of a regional or national economic hierarchy.\nThey have historically been the strongest magnets for both immigration and\nin-migration, a fact that has been accentuated since the mid-20th century (though\nmassive migration has taken place in the past). London, along with other large\nEuropean cities, has seen new varieties of the host language emerging from\nwithin the large minority-ethnic groups who are immigrants or the recent\ndescendents of immigrants (Cornips, 2002; Kotsinas, 1998; Quist, forthcoming).\nCross-ethnic social contacts allow these new forms of speech to diffuse to other\nspeakers and from there to enter the mainstream of the speech community. This\nis what we are beginning to see in the diphthong changes described in this article.\nN O T E S\n1.
