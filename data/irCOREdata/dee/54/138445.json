A sandy loam soil8\nwas packed into soil flumes (2.5 m long x 1 m wide) at a bulk density of 1400 kg m-3. Cattle9\nslurry was either spread onto the soil surface or uniformly incorporated into the soil at a rate10\nof 30 Mg ha-1 (7.5 kg\/plot). Simulated rainfall was applied to the plots at an intensity of 7011\nmm h-1, using a pressure irrigation sprinkler. Presumptive faecal coliform (PFCs)12\nconcentrations were higher in the runoff from the surface applied treatment (concentration13\nrange 1.9 x 104 - 1.1 x 106 PFC 100 ml-1) than from the incorporated treatments14\n(concentration range 6.0 x 103 - 8.7 x 105 PFC 100 ml-1). Rates of transport of organic15\nsediment and PFCs were highest in the initial phase of each experiment and declined as the16\nsimulation proceeded. The transport of PFCs and organic sediment were strongly correlated17\n(values of r ranged from 0.72-0.91), although there was considerable variation in this18\nrelationship from one experimental run to another. The implications of these findings for the19\nprotection of surface waters from pollution by bacterial contaminants are considered.20\n1Department of Environmental Science, Institute of Environmental and Natural Sciences, Lancaster University,21\nLancaster,LA1 4YQ , United Kingdom22\n2 Institute of Water and Environment, Cranfield University, Silsoe, Bedford MK45 4DT United Kingdom23\n*Corresponding author (s.tyrrel@cranfield.ac.uk , tel: +44 1525 863293 , fax: +44 1525 86334424\n3 Department of Environment and Soil Science, University of Lleida, Alcalde Rovira Roure 177, E-25198,25\nLleida, Spain26\nAbbreviations: PFCs: presumptive faecal coliforms27\nKey words28\nSlurry, Faecal Coliforms, Pathogen transport, Overland Flow, Slurry Management, Diffuse29\npollution30\nIntroduction31\nAbout 90 million tonnes of livestock slurry and manure are produced annually in the UK and32\nthis represents a significant resource for nutrient recycling via land application (Smith et al.33\n2001). However, the benefits of waste recycling may be partially offset by the risk of water34\npollution associated with runoff from fields to which slurry or manure has been applied35\n(MAFF, 1998). In addition to the pollution threat posed by chemical components of animal36\nfaecal wastes such as readily biodegradable organic compounds, ammoniacal nitrogen and37\nother nutrients, a proportion of livestock slurries and manures also contain pathogens such as38\nListeria, Campylobacter, Salmonella, E. coli 0157, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia (Nicholson39\net al., 2000). Thus, the contamination of surface waters with runoff from fields to which40\nlivestock wastes have been applied may lead to humans being exposed to such41\nmicroorganisms via several routes. Examples include exposure to livestock waste derived42\npathogens via: drinking water (Ongerth and Stibbs, 1987; Hansen and Ongerth, 1991; Poulton43\net al., 1991; Skerrett and Holland, 2000); bathing waters (Geldreich, 1996; Wyer et al., 1996;44\nBaudart et al., 2000); and water used for the irrigation of ready to eat foods (Tyrrel, 1999).45\nGiven the potential impacts of surface water contamination by faecal organisms, managing46\nthe application of slurries and manures to soils to prevent the bacterial contamination of47\nsurface waters is of obvious importance.48\nOverland flow is an important pathway for the transport of pathogens to water and there is no49\nshortage of work describing this, see for example Caskey et al., (1971); Reddy et al., (1981);50\nCrane et al., (1983); Sherer et al., (1992); Coyne and Blevins, (1995); Daniel et al., (1995);51\nMawdsley et al., (1996); Yeghiazarian and Montemagno, (2000), although there are52\ncontradictions. One debate centres on whether or not incorporation or injection will reduce53\npathogen losses. Daniel et al. (1995) found no significant differences in pathogen losses54\nbetween surface applied and incorporated manure. Similar findings are reported by McCaskey55\net al. (1971) and Heinonen-Tanski and Uusi-K\u00e4mpp\u00e4 (2001) for injected and surface applied56\nmanures. We believe that these contradictory findings are due to the die off an growth of57\nbacteria within the soil or on its surface prior to a runoff event, and that the incorporation of58\nslurrues and manures will reduce the availability of bacteria for transport in overland flow if59\nall other factors are constant. Our work therefore tests the hypotheses that the incorporation of60\nslurries will lead to a reduced number of bacteria being detached and transported over the soil61\nsurface.62\nMaterial and methods63\nThe study was performed in the laboratory using soil flumes set at a 5 % slope. The flume64\n(Fig. 1) were 2.5 m long, 1m wide (across slope) and 30 cm deep, with a mesh screen located65\nat the bottom of the slope to retain the soil, to allow drainage and thus to avoid the creation of66\nsaturated conditions.67\nSimulated rainfall was applied to the plots at an intensity of 70 mm h-1, using a pressure68\nirrigation sprinkler. We chose a high intensity storm to represent extreme conditions: a storm69\nof this intensity for 15 minutes is estimated, using the method of Faulkner (1999) as having a70\nreturn period of 14 years for Bedfordshire, in Southern England. The sprinkler had a nozzle71\n(LECHLER GMbh 56072830-CE) positioned 2 m above the soil surface. Raindrop size72\nranged between 0.7 mm and 2.8 mm, with a D50 value of 1.2 mm.73\nA sandy loam textured soil (Table 1) of the Cottenham series defined by Clayden and Hollis74\n(1984) and classified as Lamellic Ustipsamment (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) was used75\nthroughout the experiments. The soil was passed through a 9.5 mm sieve and packed into the76\nflume at a bulk density of about 1400 kg m-3. One day prior to each runoff experiment, the77\nerosion plot was exposed to simulated rainfall, whilst protected with fabric to avoid soil78\ndetachment, and allowed to drain for 24 hours to give an initial soil moisture content close to79\nfield capacity.80\nCattle slurry from a local dairy farm was applied to the soil at a rate of 30 Mg ha-1 (7.581\nkg\/plot), which is below the maximum value recommend (MAFF, 1998) and represents a82\nnormal application rate for many arable farmers in the UK. The dry solids content of the83\nslurry ranged from 8-24%. Prior to application the number of presumptive faecal coliforms84\n(PFCs) present in the slurry was enumerated. Ten g of moist slurry was added to 200 mL of85\nsterile water and placed on a mechanical shaker for 20 min. This solution was serially diluted86\nprior to enumeration of PFCs by membrane filtration (APHA, 1992). The result was87\nexpressed on a weight basis of slurry.88\nThe soil slope was exposed to simulated rainfall within 24 h of the slurry application. For89\neach simulation the time to runoff was recorded and then samples were taken every five90\nminutes until runoff had reached a constant value. The sediment concentration was91\ndetermined gravimetrically for each sample. The organic matter content of the sediment was92\ndetermined by loss after ignition in a furnace at 550 \uf0b0C for 4h. One aliquot of each runoff93\nsample was separated for the microbiological analysis. This was analysed in triplicate94\nfollowing serial dilution by membrane filtration (APHA, 1992).95\nResults96\nStatistical analysis using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test revealed that there was no significant97\ndifference (p<0.1) between the mean total runoff volume from the incorporated and surface98\napplied plots during the 45 minute sampling period (Table 2). The total mass of mineral99\nsediment transported was highest in the incorporated treatment whereas the total mass of100\norganic sediment transported was highest in the surface applied treatment (Table 2). These101\ndifferences between the concentrations of mineral and organic sediment in runoff from the102\ntwo treatments were significant at the p<0.1 level. Mineral sediment concentrations were103\ngenerally stable for both treatments throughout the duration of the experiment (Figure 2). All104\nreplicates are presented in this, and subsequent figures as samples were not taken at identical105\ntimes and the results could not therefore be averaged. Although the three replicates for the106\nsurface applied treatment behaved similarly, one of the replicates for the incorporated107\ntreatment was inexplicably different from the other two. Differences were also observed in the108\nconcentrations of organic sediment in the runoff from the two treatments (Figure 3). Organic109\nsediment concentrations were generally higher in the first 20 minutes of the experiment after110\nwhich the concentrations were broadly similar for the two treatments. Organic sediment111\nconcentrations declined more gradually in the runoff from the incorporated plots and were112\ngenerally less variable than in the runoff from the surface applied plots. The higher rate of113\norganic sediment transport from the surface applied plots was also reflected in the mean total114\nmass of organic sediment transported during the experiment (Table 2). The effect of simulated115\nrainfall on the transport of faecal coliforms from the runoff plots can be seen in Figure 4. To116\naccount for variations in the initial faecal bacterial load of the batches of slurry used for the117\nincorporated and surface applied experiments, the data have been normalised by calculating118\nthe ratio of the number of faecal coliforms 100 mL-1 runoff to the number of faecal coliforms119\ng-1 slurry. This analysis suggests that faecal coliforms were very mobile in the first fifteen120\nminutes of the surface applied experiments but that this rate of transport declined rapidly as121\nthe simulation progressed. Faecal coliforms were much less readily transported in runoff from122\nthe incorporated treatment, and a gradual decline in the rate of faecal coliform transport was123\nobserved throughout the duration of the experiment.124\nDiscussion125\nThe results indicate that the method of slurry application affected the dynamics of sediment126\nand faecal bacterial transport. Surface application of slurry led to higher concentrations in127\nrunoff of both organic sediment and PFCs when compared to the incorporated treatment. As128\nthe surface applied slurry was exposed to the erosive forces of rainsplash and overland flow129\none would expect the organic matter particles and faecal organisms to be readily detached and130\ntransported. Conversely, mineral sediment erosion was suppressed when slurry was surface131\napplied. This is probably explained by the protective effect that the layer of slurry had on the132\nsoil surface. The results corroborate our initial hypothesis that the incorporation of slurry will133\nreduce the numbers of PFCs transported by reducing the number of organisms exposed to134\ndetachment processes.135\nThere were similarities in the pattern of transport of PFCs and organic matter in both the136\nsurface applied and incorporated experiments i.e. losses were greatest in the initial part of the137\nstorm followed by a decline in concentration as the experiment proceeded. This pattern was138\nmost pronounced when the slurry was surface applied. The relationship between faecal139\ncoliform and organic sediment concentrations in runoff for the incorporated and surface140\nexperiments is shown in Figures 5 and 6 respectively. Although there is apparently a strong141\ncorrelation between these variables, there is substantial variation between experimental runs142\nin the values of the slope and intercept of the regression lines and the factors responsible for143\nthis variation have not yet been elucidated. The PFC concentrations in the batches of slurry144\nused for each experiment did vary but this alone does not appear to account for the differences145\nin PFC concentration in the runoff. The percentage of dry matter was also very variable. It is146\npossible that the batches of slurry used in each experiment varied in terms of the partitioning147\nof PFCs between organic matter particle surfaces and cells\/cell aggregates disassociated from148\nthese particles.149\nThe decline in organic sediment transport as each experiment proceeded is in contrast to the150\nrelatively stable rates of mineral sediment transport throughout the six experimental runs.151\nThis suggests that in the initial stages of each storm organic slurry particles were152\npreferentially removed from this soil surface. As the storm proceeded more resistant material153\nwas left behind and rates of transport fell. Such a process has been modelled by Rose and his154\nco workers (Hairsine and Rose, 1991; Rose et al., 1994; Sander et al., 1996) and155\ndemonstrated experimentally for soil erosion (Heilig et al., 2001), whereby finer material is156\nremoved leaving a more resistant layer of coarse particles, causing detachment rates to decline157\nthrough time. Our results suggest that if the transport of organic particles derived from158\nmanure and slurry is to be modelled a similar approach will be required.159\nConclusions160\nWe conclude that a greater proportion of applied PFCs is transported from surface applied161\nthan from incorporated slurries, and that this declines with time due the initial removal of162\neasily detached material leaving behind material that is more resistant to detachment. This163\ngives us an important insight into how microorganisms are detached and transported from soil164\nsurfaces and indicates that the process may be modelled in the future. Furthermore, our165\nfindings indicate that the transport of faecal microorganisms is correlated to the transport of166\norganic sediment particles. The number of PFCs per unit of organic sediment transported167\nvaried considerably from one experiment to another. The range of faecal coliform168\nconcentrations in the runoff from these experiments (6.0 x 103 \u2013 1.1 x 106 PFC 100 ml-1)169\nrepresents a very significant risk to surface water pollution.170\nThe contradictory evidence in the literature over whether or not the incorporation of slurries171\nand manures reduces the faecal pollution of water courses appears to be due to the survival of172\nbacteria once applied to the soil. Our view is that where possible slurries and manures should173\nbe incorporated since this reduces the risk of movement in overland flow, thus reducing the174\nrisk of water pollution. Since it is likely that pathogenic bacteria will survive within the soil175\nafter application, all steps should be taken to reduce the pathogenic content of the manure or176\nslurry prior to application.177\nAcknowledgement178\nFinancial support for the project has been provided by the Biotechnology and Biological179\nSciences Research Council (BBSRC); grant number 63\/MAF12260.180\nReferences181\nAPHA.
