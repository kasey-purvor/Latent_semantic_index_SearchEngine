Wyse5\nReceived 2006 July 7; accepted 2006 November 12\nABSTRACT\nWe present low-resolution spectroscopy of 120 red giants in the Galactic satellite dwarf spheroidal (dSph) Leo I, ob-\ntainedwith GeminiNGMOS andKeckDEIMOS.We find stars with velocities consistent withmembership of Leo I out\nto 1.3 King tidal radii. By measuring accurate radial velocities with a median measurement error of 4.6 km s\u00011, we\nfind a mean systemic velocity of 284.2 km s\u00011 with a global velocity dispersion of 9.9 km s\u00011. The dispersion profile\nis consistent with being flat out to the last data point. We show that a marginally significant rise in the radial dis-\npersion profile at a radius of 30 is not associatedwith any real localized kinematical substructure. Given its large distance\nfrom the Galaxy, tides are not likely to have affected the velocity dispersion, a statement we support from a quantitative\nkinematical analysis, as we observationally reject the occurrence of a significant apparent rotational signal or an\nasymmetric velocity distribution. Mass determinations adopting both isotropic stellar velocity dispersions and more\ngeneral models yield anM \/L of 24, which is consistent with the presence of a significant dark halowith amass of about\n3 ; 107 M\u0002, in which the luminous component is embedded. This suggests that Leo I exhibits dark matter properties\nsimilar to those of other dSphs in the Local Group. Our data allowed us also to determine metallicities for 58 of the\ntargets. We find a mildly metal-poor mean of\u00011.31 dex and a full spread covering 1 dex. In contrast to the majority\nof dSphs, Leo I appears to show no radial gradient in its metallicities, which points to a negligible role of external\ninfluences in this galaxy\u2019s evolution.\nSubject headinggs: galaxies: abundances \u2014 galaxies: dwarf \u2014 galaxies: evolution \u2014 galaxies: individual (Leo I) \u2014\ngalaxies: kinematics and dynamics\nOnline material: color figure, machine-readable table\n1. INTRODUCTION\nLeo I is the most remote dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy gen-\nerally believed to be associated with the Milky Way (MW) sub-\nsystem in the Local Group (LG; see Table 1 of Grebel et al. 2003).\nDue to its remarkably high radial velocity of about 287 km s\u00011\n(Zaritsky et al. 1989; Mateo et al. 1998, hereafter M98) and its\ncurrent large distance of\u0003254 kpc (Bellazzini et al. 2004), Leo I\nis a crucial tracer for determining the total mass of the Galaxy\n(e.g., Kochanek 1996). The question of whether Leo I is actually\nbound to theGalaxy remains open (e.g., Byrd et al. 1994).A quan-\ntitative assessment of the possible role of Galactic tides in the\ninternal (dynamical, star formation history, etc.) evolution of the\nGalactic satellite dSphs is of considerable importance, for its im-\nplications for the evolution of small galaxies, and for the distri-\nbution of darkmatter on small scales. In particular, Leo I is of great\ninterest here, given its very large galactocentric distance, as it is\nthe least likely dSph to be affected by tides (but see also the\nrecent work of Sohn et al. 2006, hereafter S06). Similarities in its\ndynamics with those of more nearby dwarfs would strengthen our\nconfidence that Galactic tides are not a major effect in determi-\nnations of the dark matter distribution of both Leo I itself and the\nother dSphs.\nThemultiplexing capabilities of present-daymultiobject spectro-\ngraphs on 4Y10 m class telescopes have opened a window to study\ndSph galaxies in unprecedented detail by enabling one to gather\ndata sets for a large number of individual stars. As a result, the\nsystemic velocities of the majority of the LG dSphs are known\n(tabulated in the reviews by Grebel 1997; Mateo 1998; van den\nBergh 1999; and more recent measurements as quoted in, e.g.,\nEvans et al. 2000, 2003).Moreover, high-precision radial velocity\ndata for many individual stars in all of the known dSphs are being\nobtained. These serve as the kinematical input for detailed dy-\nnamical studies (M98; Co\u02c6te\u00b4 et al. 1999; Kleyna et al. 2001, 2003,\n2004; xokas 2002; Wilkinson et al. 2004, 2006a, 2006b; Tolstoy\net al. 2004; Chapman et al. 2005;Mun\u02dcoz et al. 2005, 2006b;Walker\net al. 2006a, 2006b and references therein), which are determin-\ning the spatial distribution of dark matter on the smallest available\nscales.\nDSphs are the least massive and least luminous galaxies\nknown to exist. They are characterized by absolute V-band lu-\nminosities MV k \u000114 mag, low surface brightnesses of \u0001V k\n22 mag arcsec\u00012, and H i masses of less than 105 M\u0002 (Grebel\net al. 2003 and references therein). They have high central stellar\nradial velocity dispersions, typically of order 10 km s\u00011 (Aaronson\n1983;Mateo 1998), which, together with their globular clusterYlike\nlow luminosities (Gallagher &Wyse 1994; Mateo 1998) and their\nlarge core size (hundreds of parsecs rather than the few parsecs\nof star clusters), demonstrate that these galaxies are dominated\nby dark matter at all radii (Mateo 1997; Wilkinson et al. 2004,\n2006a). This deduction presumes that the dSphs are in a state of\ndynamical equilibrium, a presumption supported by direct ev-\nidence that the dSphs are not highly elongated down our lines of\nsight (e.g., Odenkirchen et al. 2001; Mackey & Gilmore 2003;\nA\n1 Department of Physics and Astronomy, Astronomical Institute of the Uni-\nversity of Basel, Binningen, Switzerland.\n2 Current address: Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCLA, Los\nAngeles, CA; akoch@astro.ucla.edu.\n3 Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.\n4 Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI.\n5 Department of Physics andAstronomy, JohnsHopkinsUniversity, Baltimore,\nMD.\n241\nThe Astrophysical Journal, 657:241Y261, 2007 March 1\n# 2007.

This assumption merits a careful test, how-\never, especially in the outermost parts of the dSphs, where Ga-\nlactic tides might become significant.\nThe inferred highmass-to-light ratios (M\/L), obtained under the\nassumption of dynamical equilibrium, are as large as 500 (M\/L)\u0002\nor more, making dSphs the smallest observable objects available\nto study the properties of dark matter halos. Available measure-\nments suggest that the dark matter in dSphs has some common\nproperties, including aminimum halomass scale of\u00034 ; 107 M\u0002,\na small range in central (dark) mass densities, and a minimum\nlength (core radius) scale of order 100 pc (Wilkinson et al. 2006a).\nIf established, these are the first characteristic properties of dark\nmatter.\nCold dark matter (CDM) simulations of galaxy formation pre-\ndict the existence of a large number of subhalos surrounding larger\ngalaxies, such as the MWor M31 (e.g., Moore et al. 1999). The\ncorrectness of this prediction remains a subject of debate: the\nnumber of observed dSphs is much less, although several have\nbeen discovered very recently, indicating that the known sample is\nincomplete (Belokurov et al. 2006, 2007; Martin et al. 2006;\nZucker et al. 2006a, 2006b, 2006c). The correspondence between\nprediction and observation more importantly requires masses,\nso that dynamical studies of the dSphs are critical.\nThe spatial distribution of dark matter on small scales is an ad-\nditional test of the nature of dark matter. Numerical simulations\nof darkmatter halos inwhich it is assumed that there is no physical\nprocess except gravity acting remain limited in spatial resolu-\ntion, but in general they are characterized by a central density cusp\n\u0002(r) \/ r\u0001a with a \u00bc 1Y1:5 (e.g., Navarro et al. 1995, hereafter\nNFW95; Ghigna et al. 2000). It is far from clear that these ex-\npectations are consistent with observations of galaxies significantly\nmore massive than the dSphs (de Blok et al. 2001; Spekkens et al.\n2005), which are better accounted for by flat density cores. The\navailable data on dSph kinematics appear to be consistent with\ncored halos aswell (xokas 2002; Read&Gilmore 2005;Wilkinson\net al. 2006a). In the UrsaMinor dSph a central, constant-density\ncore has been detected (Kleyna et al. 2003), and also in the Fornax\ndSph a core may be more likely than a cusped distribution, al-\nthough these inferences are still subject to large uncertainties\n(Strigari et al. 2006; Goerdt et al. 2006). It has been suggested\nthat the cusp\/core distinction could be the first indication of the\nproperties of the physical particles that make up CDM (Read &\nGilmore 2005), although it is essential that one allows for dy-\nnamical evolution associated with the astrophysical evolution\nof the dSph progenitors (Grebel et al. 2003).\nAccording to a second scenario, the large observed velocity dis-\npersions may be explained if dSphs are unbound tidal remnants\nthat underwent tidal disruptionwhile orbiting theMW(Kuhn 1993;\nKroupa 1997; Klessen & Kroupa 1998; Klessen & Zhao 2002;\nFleck & Kuhn 2003; Majewski et al. 2005) and all happen to be\naligned to mimic a bound system. Predictions following from\nthis scenario include a significant depth extent along the line of\nsight (Klessen&Kroupa 1998; Klessen& Zhao 2002). However,\nin two of the closest MW companions, the Draco dSph (Klessen\net al. 2003) and the Fornax dwarf (Mackey & Gilmore 2003),\ndirect evidence against such effects is available. Other arguments\nagainst dSphs being unbound tidal remnants without dark matter\ninclude that they all experienced extended star formation his-\ntories with considerable chemical enrichment and that they follow\na metallicity-luminosity relation (for details see Grebel et al. 2003).\nIn the light of its large galactocentric distance, Leo I iswell suited as\na test of the possible importance of tidal perturbation.\nThe subject of tides in the context of dSph galaxies suffers from\na very distorted literature. In large part this follows from a his-\ntorical labeling issue. Specifically, the projected surface bright-\nness distributions of dSph galaxies are nowadays preferentially\nfitted with King models. A King model has two named linear\nscales: an inner scale, frequently called a \u2018\u2018core radius,\u2019\u2019 and an\nouter truncation radius, called a \u2018\u2018tidal radius.\u2019\u2019 While these labels\nhave some relevance in their historical application to models of\nglobular clusters of stars truncated by Galactic tides, they have no\ngeneral physical interpretation in a different context. In general,\ndSph stellar populations are not single component, and there is no\nastrophysical reason to assume ab initio that the distribution func-\ntion is simply isothermal. Some form of numerically tractable\nfunctional fit to a projected surface brightness profile is required\nin the dynamical analysis, but a more sophisticated analysis is\nrequired than fitting functions to surface brightness profiles before\nthe possible importance of tides can be investigated. It is some-\ntimes suggested that high-frequency distorted photometric struc-\nture is indicative of tidal damage, but no available numerical\nsimulations support this view: rather, if tides are important, they\nproduce smooth systematic distortions in the outer parts of a\nsystem. One test, applicable in some circumstances, is detection\nof apparent rotation or spatially asymmetric velocity distribu-\ntions associated with such a distortion, as claimed to be present\nin Leo I by S06. We consider that in our analysis of Leo I. Some\nof these relevant issues are discussed further by Read & Gilmore\n(2005) and Read et al. (2006a, 2006b).\nBased on its projected position on the sky, Leo I was suggested\nto be part of a Galactic Fornax-Leo-Sculptor stream (Lynden-Bell\n1982; Majewski 1994), i.e., that it lies along a Galactic polar great\nplane together with these other dSph galaxies. However, despite\nthe lack of proper motion and orbital measurements for Leo I, the\nradial velocity and kinematical data at hand apparently rule out a\nphysical association of Leo Iwith such a physical group (Lynden-\nBell & Lynden-Bell 1995; Piatek et al. 2002, 2006). The remote\nLeo I dSph holds a special place in the kinematic studies of MW\nsatellites (M98). From detailed kinematical modeling of the ve-\nlocity dispersion profile of 33 stars within the core region of Leo I,\nM98 concluded that this dSph contains a significant amount of\ndark matter.\nApart from its stellar kinematics, Leo I is interesting in terms of\nits star formation history (SFH; see also Bosler et al. 2006). The\ndSphs of the LG exhibit a variety of SFHs, where no two dwarfs\nare alike (Grebel 1997; Mateo 1998). In spite of this diversity, all\nnearby galaxies studied in sufficient detail have been shown to\nshare a common epoch of ancient star formation, although the\nfraction of old populations with ages >10 Gyr varies from galaxy\nto galaxy (Grebel 2000; Grebel & Gallagher 2004). Indeed Leo I\nhas a prominent old stellar population (Held et al. 2000), but more\nstriking is the prevalence of intermediate-age populations: about\n87% of its stars formed between 1 and 7 Gyr ago (Gallart et al.\n1999a). The details of the SFH of Leo I were derived photo-\nmetrically, but particularly in galaxies withmixed populations the\nage-metallicity degeneracy cannot be broken without spectros-\ncopy. Our current inferences of the chemical evolutionary histo-\nries of nearby dwarf galaxies are still mainly based on photometry,\nwhile detailed and numerous spectroscopy of as many stars as\npossible is invaluable for helping to securely constrain the SFHs\nor to quantify age-metallicity relations. It is also essential to study\nthe chemical evolution of dSphs in order to understand their com-\nplex SFHs in terms of regulating processes such as the inflow or\naccretion, as well as the outflow of gas (Carigi et al. 2002; Dong\net al. 2003; Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2004; Hensler et al. 2004;\nRobertson et al. 2005; Font et al. 2006). We are currently con-\nducting a program to measure the kinematics and chemical abun-\ndances in several Galactic dSphs and to correlate these with their\nKOCH ET AL.242 Vol. 657\nevolutionary histories (e.g., Wilkinson et al. 2006b; Koch et al.\n2006).\nHerewe present a kinematic and abundance study of the distant\nGalactic dSph Leo I. In addition to a detailed kinematic analysis,\nappropriate to the size of the available data set, we have measured\nthe average metallicity and the spread and shape of Leo I\u2019s metal-\nlicity distribution function (MDF),which provide valuable insights\non any possible environmental dependence of the processes gov-\nerning the evolution of dSphs. This paper is organized as fol-\nlows: In x 2 we describe our data acquisition and reduction and\nthe determination of stellar velocities. In x 3 we derive Leo I\u2019s\nglobal velocity distribution, from which we investigate potential\nvelocity gradients in x 4. Section 5 is then dedicated to the analysis\nof Leo I\u2019s radial velocity dispersion profile and the influence of\nbinaries on this profile. This radial profile allowed us to obtain\nmass and density estimates of this galaxy in x 6. The role of an\nanisotropic velocity distribution on dispersion and mass estimates\nis addressed in x 7. In x 8we derivemetallicities for our targets and\ndiscuss the implications for Leo I\u2019s chemical evolution, and x 9\nfinally summarizes our results.\n2. DATA\n2.1. Target Selection\nTargets were selected from photometry obtained within the\nframework of the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU)\nat the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) on La Palma, Spain.6\nFrom this, we selected red giants so as to cover magnitudes from\nthe tip of the red giant branch (RGB) at I \u0003 18 mag (Bellazzini\net al. 2004) down to\u00031.6 mag below the RGB tip, going as faint\nas I P19:6. At our faintest observed magnitudes, our spectra reach\nsignal-to-noise ratios (S\/N) of\u00035, which is sufficient to enable\naccurate radial velocity measurements at our low resolution.\n2.2. Observations\nOne part of our observations was carried out in queuemodewith\nthe Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph (GMOS) at the 8 m Gemini\nNorth telescope, Hawaii, over four nights between 2004 December\nand 2005 January. These data were obtained under photometric\nconditions and a clear sky. The camera consists of three adjacent\n2048 ; 4068 CCDs, which are separated by gaps with a width of\n\u000337 pixels each.Weused 0.500 widemultiobject slits and theR400+\nG5305 grating set in two modes, with central wavelengths of 8550\nand 86008, providing a spectral coverage of 18008. This dither-\ning enabled us to efficiently interpolate the spectra across the\nCCDs\u2019 gaps during the later co-addition process. The CCDs were\nbinned by 2 ; 4 during readout and the resulting spectra have a\nnominal resolution of 2200. In total, we targeted 68 red giants\nspread over three different fields in the eastern half of the galaxy\n(see Fig. 1, Table 1). Each of the three fields was exposed for 3 hr\nin total, where we split up the exposures into 3 ; 1800 s per setup\n(i.e., each of the two wavelength modes) to facilitate sky sub-\ntraction and cosmic-ray removal. Due to bad weather, the central\npointing (field 3; see Table 1)was exposed for only 3600 s in total.\nThe other part of our data was obtained with the Deep Im-\naging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) at the 10 m Keck II\ntelescope. Leo I was observed on the DEIMOS multislit spec-\ntrograph on the Keck II telescope on 2005 February 6Y8. Con-\nditions were mediocre, with high humidity and poor seeing, but\napproximately 6 hr of Leo I observations were obtained, con-\nsisting of five slit masks concentrated on the dSph\u2019s periphery.\nWe used the 1200 line mm\u00011 grating. The slits were 0.700 in size,\nand our resolution was about 0.3 8 pixel\u00011.\n2.3. Data Reduction\n2.3.1. GMOS Data\nThe GMOS data were reduced using the standard GMOS re-\nduction package in IRAF, starting with the bias frames taken as\npart of the daytime calibration process. Spectroscopic flat-field\nexposures were obtained adjacent to each set of science exposures,\nfrom which we could model and remove the spectral signature\nand spatial profile of the illumination pattern. Through divid-\ning by the remaining normalized flat-field frame, we ensured a\n6 See http:\/\/www.ast.cam.ac.uk\/~wfcsur\/.\nTABLE 1\nObservation Log\nField\n\u0003\n(J2000.0)\n\u0004\n(J2000.0) Date Instrument\nExposure Time\n(s)\nField 1 ............... 10 09 01 +12 22 47 2004 Dec 11 GMOS 3 ; 1800\n10 09 01 +12 22 47 2004 Dec 12 GMOS 3 ; 1800\nField 2 ............... 10 08 59 +12 16 00 2004 Dec 12 GMOS 3 ; 1800\n10 08 59 +12 16 00 2004 Dec 15 GMOS 3 ; 1800\nField 3 ............... 10 08 39 +12 19 43 2005 Jan 06 GMOS 2 ; 1800\nNo. 1 ................. 10 09 14 +12 18 00 2005 Feb 06 DEIMOS 7200\nNo. 2 ................. 10 07 40 +12 17 00 2005 Feb 07 DEIMOS 9000\nNo. 3 ................. 10 08 05 +12 18 00 2005 Feb 08 DEIMOS 5400\nFig. 1.\u2014Location of our targets centered on the Leo I dSph at (\u0003; \u0004 ) \u00bc\n(10h08m28s; \u00fe12\u00041801800). Red giants observed with GMOS are shown as filled\ncircles, and DEIMOS targets are depicted as open squares. Overlaid ellipses des-\nignate Leo I\u2019s core and nominal tidal radius at 3.30 and 12.60, respectively.

Since the\nCuArwavelength calibration frameswere taken up to 4 days before\nand\/or after the science spectra, during which time the telescope\nflexuremay significantly change, we had to rely on the skylines of\neach individual science exposure to obtain an accurate wavelength\nsolution. Hence, we chose a number of strong and isolated, un-\nblended night-sky OH emission lines around the CaT region from\nthe atlas of Osterbrock et al. (1996, 1997). Fitting the respective\nlines with a low-order polynomial yielded an rms uncertainty in\nthe wavelength calibration of the order of 0.05 8, corresponding\nto \u00032 km s\u00011 at our region of interest.7 A crucial step in the\nanalysis of CaTabsorption features consists of the accurate sub-\ntraction of the prominent skylines in the near-infrared spectral\nregion. While the centers of the first two of the Ca triplet lines\nare unaffected by adjacent skylines at Leo I\u2019s systemic velocity,\nthe third Ca absorption line coincides with the dominant OH\nband at\u00038670 8. These undesired contaminants are efficiently\nremoved by the software by fitting a low-order polynomial to\nthe background and subtracting this fit column by column from\nthe science spectra. Moreover, the accuracy of our sky-subtracted\nspectra (after co-addition) was improved by the fact that we ob-\ntained spectra with the slit centered both at the center and offset\ntoward the right- and left-hand sides of the stellar seeing disk,\nyielding a better coverage of the average sky background. Finally,\nthe extracted spectra were shifted toward the local standard of\nrest barycenter and median combined using a standard \u0005-clipping\nalgorithm. The average S\/N achieved throughout our reductions\nis \u000328, with a minimum of 5.3 at I \u00bc 19:6.\n2.3.2. DEIMOS Data\nThe DEIMOS data were reduced using the DEEP8 pipeline,\ndeveloped by the DEEP2 project at the University of California-\nBerkeley and based on the IDL spectral reduction pipeline of the\nSloanDigital Sky Survey (Abazajian et al. 2004). TheDEEPpipe-\nline first identifies spectra using tungsten lamp flat-field exposures\nand then finds a two-dimensional (pixel by pixel) wavelength\nsolution for each spectrum, assisted by a DEIMOS-specific op-\ntical model. Typically, the solution is accurate to 0.005 8. All\ncalibration imageswere taken at the start of each night; this is pos-\nsible because the spectrograph optical system is stabilized using an\nactive flexure compensation system. Sky subtraction is performed\nusing a b-spline sky model. In the last stage, the sky-subtracted\ntwo-dimensional spectra are extracted into one-dimensional\nflux and variance spectra in the form of FITS tables. The variance\nspectrum is finally used to compute the spectral S\/N. The S\/N\nachieved throughout our processing reaches \u000345 for the brighest\ntargets and is as low as 5 for the faintest stars at I \u00bc 21:2.\nGenerally, the DEEP pipeline worked as expected. For certain\nexposures, however, the slit identification and tracing in the flats\nfailed, and we found that the sensitivity parameter controlling\nslit detection had to be adjusted.\n2.4. Radial Velocities\nRadial velocities were derived from our final reduced set of\nspectra by cross-correlating the three strong Ca lines at 8498,\n8542, and 8662 8 against a synthetic template spectrum of the\nCaT region using IRAF\u2019s cross-correlation package FXCOR.\nThe template was synthesized using representative equivalent\nwidths of the CaT in red giants. The final velocity difference be-\ntween object spectrum and the rest-frame template was then de-\ntermined from a parabolic fit to the strongest correlation peak.\n2.5. Velocity Errors\nThe formal velocity errors returned from the cross-correlation\nin IRAF have a median value of 1.7 km s\u00011. However, we have\nfound in past studies that the FXCOR estimates are generally\ntoo optimistic (see, e.g., M98; Kleyna et al. 2002). Since we have\nonly single-epoch data at hand, lacking the possibility to compare\nthe velocity stability over a longer time period, we cannot estimate\nthe true uncertainties through the discrepancies of measurements\ntaken at different times (Vogt et al. 1995; M98). For the GMOS\ndata, we rather follow the prescription of Kleyna et al. (2002) and\ndivide the data of the brightest stars (with I \u0005 19 mag) into two\nfinal sets of spectra, the first comprising those individual spectra\nwith a central wavelength of 8550 8 and the second being those\ncentered at 8600 8. Each of these sets was separately cross-\ncorrelated against the template.Weuse the discrepancy between the\ntwo resultant velocities as an estimate of the true measurement\nerror. Hence, we rescaled the Tonry-Davis R-based errors (Tonry\n& Davis 1979) returned by FXCOR to obtain the expected re-\nduced \u00062 discrepancy of unity. We found that we had to apply a\nscale factor of 2.7 to yield an accurate estimate of our velocity\nerrors. In order to check whether our wavelength calibration,\nwhich is based on only a narrow spectral window around the CaT,\nhas introduced any bias, we also determined radial velocities by\ncross-correlating each of the three Ca lines separately against the\nsame template. In this case, the mean deviation of the resultant\nvelocities did not exceed 1.8 km s\u00011. These uncertainties were\nadded in quadrature to the formal measurement errors (including\nthe above Tonry-Davis R scaling) to yield the final velocity error,\nwhich we show in Table 2. The final GMOS data set contained\n68 stars with a median velocity error of 5.0 km s\u00011.\nTABLE 2\nCharacteristics of the Target Stars\nID\n\u0003\n(J2000.0)\n\u0004\n(J2000.0) I V \u0001 I\nr\n(arcmin)\nvHC\n(arcmin)\n\u0004vHC\n(km s\u00011)\nR\n(km s\u00011) S\/N [Fe\/H]CG \u0004[Fe\/H]CG\n103.............. 10 08 28 12 18 51 17.77 1.43 0.68 288.06 3.99 59.78 50 \u00010.99 0.13\n132.............. 10 08 48 12 19 44 18.03 1.48 5.15 282.07 6.28 36.12 28 \u00011.45 0.11\n137.............. 10 08 27 12 20 31 17.93 1.56 2.80 292.81 5.33 43.99 40 \u00011.38 0.12\n141.............. 10 09 00 12 18 21 18.09 1.43 7.91 276.51 3.97 58.39 65 \u00011.76 0.11\n143.............. 10 08 32 12 18 34 18.10 1.32 1.18 292.99 14.29 14.10 6 . . . . . .\nNote.\u2014Note that the velocities from both the GMOS and DEIMOS samples have been shifted to a common mean.

However, when concentrating on the narrow win-\ndow (\u00035008) around theCaT, inwhichwe are primarily interested, we circumvent\nany distortions toward the edges of the spectra and could thus obtain a highly\nimproved accuracy.\n8 See http:\/\/astro.berkeley.edu\/~cooper\/deep\/spec2d\/.\nKOCH ET AL.244 Vol. 657\nFor the DEIMOS data, the nominal IRAF velocity errors were\nalso rescaled by a common factor.

RADIAL VELOCITY DISTRIBUTIONS\nTo determine an overall mean velocity and a global dispersion\nfor Leo I, a prerequisite for an assessment of the targets\u2019 mem-\nbership, we used the maximization method described in Kleyna\net al. (2002) and Walker et al. (2006a). In this approach, the prob-\nability that an observed distribution of velocities vi and correspond-\ning measurement errors \u0005i is drawn from a Gaussian distribution\nwith mean hvi and dispersion \u0005 is given by\np vi; \u0005if gj vh i; \u0005\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \/ \u0001Ni\u00bc1\n1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\u0007 \u00052 \u00fe \u00052i\u00f0 \u00de\np\n; exp \u0001 vi \u0001 vh i\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n2 \u00052 \u00fe \u00052i\u00f0 \u00de\n\" #\n: \u00f01\u00de\nIt is mathematically more convenient to calculate the natural\nlogarithm of this expression, andmaximizing ln p is equivalent to\nmaximizing p itself. Rejecting stars deviating by more than 3 \u0005 as\nlikely nonmembers, we iterated until convergence (requiring that\nthe solution from subsequent iterations changed by no more than\n0.005 km s\u00011). The respective uncertainties in the mean and dis-\npersion were then calculated from the covariance matrix (Walker\net al. 2006a). This procedure yielded a mean systemic velocity of\nLeo I of 284:2 \u0006 1:0 km s\u00011 and a dispersion of 9:9 \u0006 1:5 km s\u00011\nfrom the combined GMOS plus DEIMOS sample, (284:6 \u0006 1:5,\n9:9 \u0006 2:1) km s\u00011 for the GMOS data alone, and (283:8 \u0006 1:5,\n9:9 \u0006 2:1) km s\u00011 as derived from the DEIMOS targets only. The\nmean velocities and global dispersions are tabulated in Table 3\nseparately for the different fields, and Figure 2 shows the resulting\nhistograms.\nThis compares to a value of 287:0 \u0006 1:9 km s\u00011 as found by\nM98 and their respective dispersion of 8:8 \u0006 1:3 km s\u00011 for stars\nin the innermost 3.50.\nIf we take the 3 \u0005 cut as a membership criterion, 5 of the\n68 GMOS targets and 5 of the red giants from the DEIMOS sam-\nple have to be rejected as foreground contamination, where 4 out\nof these 5 stars in each sample have velocities below 200 km s\u00011.\nIn order to generate the final sample for determining the dispersion\nprofile of Leo I, we combined both of our GMOS and DEIMOS\nsets by shifting them to a common median velocity. This pro-\ncedure is justified by the lack of any significant radial gradient\nin the velocities from DEIMOS, which is found to be\u00010:04 \u0006\n0:18 km s\u00011 arcmin\u00011 so that such a shift does not introduce any\nartificial velocity gradient or a falsification of the dispersion pro-\nfiles. At the end of this procedure, we found that our median\nvelocity from the GMOS plus DEIMOS set differed from that of\nM98 by \u00012.8 km s\u00011, a difference significant only at the p \u00bc\n0:31 level (note that our sample has no stars in commonwith the\nM98 sample, which would allow for a direct comparison of the\nvelocities). These values are finally listed in Table 2.\n4. KINEMATIC TESTS FOR TIDAL DAMAGE\nAND APPARENT ROTATION\nThose dSph galaxies studied so far show no significant contri-\nbution from angular momentum to the systems\u2019 dynamical struc-\nture: dSphs obtain their size and shape from anisotropic random\npressure. This is, incidentally, an argument against an evolution-\nary transformation from dwarf irregular to dSph galaxies via ram\npressure stripping (e.g., van den Bergh 1999; Grebel et al. 2003).\nMore fundamentally, apparent rotation (generally visible in pro-\njection) is a characteristic signature of tidal disturbance. In this\ncontext, apparent rotation of the stellar component of a dSph is a\ntest of possible tidal \u2018\u2018heating\u2019\u2019 of the stellar orbits in the course of\nthe galaxy\u2019s orbit within the external tidal field of theMW.N-body\nsimulations, e.g., of Oh et al. (1995) have shown that the velocity\nTABLE 3\nMean Velocities and Dispersions for Different Fields\nField\nhvi\n(km s\u00011)\n\u0005\n(km s\u00011)\nGMOS, field 1 ......................................... 284.0 \u0006 2.6 7.4 \u0006 3.4\nGMOS, field 2 ......................................... 283.6 \u0006 2.8 8.8 \u0006 3.8\nGMOS, field 3 ......................................... 284.2 \u0006 2.3 12.5 \u0006 3.6\nGMOS, all................................................ 284.6 \u0006 1.5 9.9 \u0006 2.1\nDEIMOS, all ............................................ 283.8 \u0006 1.5 9.9 \u0006 2.1\nGMOS+DEIMOS..................................... 284.2 \u0006 1.0 9.9 \u0006 1.5\nGMOS+DEIMOS+M98........................... 287.0 \u0006 0.9 9.8 \u0006 1.3\nFig. 2.\u2014Radial velocity histograms of the GMOS data (solid line, left panel ), DEIMOS stars (dashed line, left panel ), and combined GMOS+DEIMOS set (right panel ).\nAll targets with velocities larger than 200 km s\u00011 are shown. Within this range, two targets (at 251 and 324 km s\u00011, respectively) fall outside a \u00063 \u0005 cut.\nSTELLAR KINEMATICS AND METALLICITIES IN LEO I 245No. 1, 2007\ndispersion of a tidally limited system is sustained at the actual\nvirial equilibrium value. On the other hand, these simulations\nsuggest that any strong dynamical effects on a dSph from the\ntidal field of the Galaxy can invoke streaming motions in the out-\nskirts of the dwarf, which will lead to a systematic change in the\nmean velocity along its major axis, thus mimicking rotation (Piatek\n& Pryor 1995; Oh et al. 1995; Johnston et al. 1995; M98). A more\ndetailed analysis of tidal effects on dSph galaxies is provided by\nRead et al. (2006b).\nIt has frequently been suggested in the literature that the de-\ntection of member stars well beyond the formal tidal limit radius\nof dSphs, canonically defined via a single-componentKingmodel\nrepresentation of the observed surface brightness profiles, is\nevidence for physical tides. A large number of dSphs have been\nclaimed to show hints of extratidal stars and thus tidal disruption\n(Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1995; Mart\u0131\u00b4nez-Delgado et al. 2001;\nPalma et al. 2003; Mun\u02dcoz et al. 2005, 2006a, 2006b). Evidence\nfor this has also been reported for Leo I (S06). What such studies\nshow, in fact, is that the presumed parametric fit to the measured\nsurface brightness (and\/or direct star counts) is inappropriate at\nlarge radii. Given that there is no astrophysical basis to the ap-\nplication of a King model to a galaxy, an astrophysical interpre-\ntation of the corresponding labels as physical processes is fraught\nwith peril. Evidence that a specific dSph is being affected by tides\nsufficiently strongly that its kinematics is affected can be provided\nmost efficiently from a kinematic analysis. A test for apparent\nouter rotation is such a test.\nWith its present-day galactocentric distance of 254 \u0006 19 kpc\nand its high systemic velocity, Leo I is not expected to be affected\nby tides. M98 concluded from their kinematical data that the core\nof this galaxy has not been significantly heated by tides. S06 report\non a large population of photometric and radial velocity mem-\nber red giant stars out to nearly two nominal tidal radii, which they\ninterpret as evidence of tidal disruption. We note that also our\nsample comprises nine red giants outside rtid , whose velocities sug-\ngest membership. We also emphasize that these statements tell\nus that the outer parts of Leo I are not well fitted by a single King\nmodel. Whether they tell us anything about the dynamics of Leo I\nremains questionable for the moment and has to await further dy-\nnamical tests.\nIn order to assess whether there is any significant indication of\nrotation in the Leo I velocities, which may help to elucidate the\nrole of tides, we pursued two tests. First, we show in Figure 3 the\nspatial distribution of our measured radial velocities (including\nM98\u2019s 33 data points) along their projected major-axis radial\ndistance. In addition, we calculated the mean velocity as a func-\ntion of radius, which is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 3.\nIt is worth noticing that this mean velocity remains fairly con-\nstant across the range covered by our data and the deviations\nfrom the global mean of our sample are well within the error bars.\nMoreover, we do not detect any significant sign of a velocity\ngradient in the inner regions as suggested by S06. If Leo I has\nbeen significantly affected by Galactic tides, one would expect\nan asymmetric excess of velocity outliers, with stars of higher\nor lower velocity typically lying on opposite sides of the galaxy\ndue to the presence of possible leading and trailing tidal tails.\nIn this vein, S06 report on the presence of a number of stars with\nhigher velocities than the average in the outer regions to the west-\nern half of Leo I. The tidal model then predicts a comparable\npresence of low-velocity stars toward the eastern extension. Al-\nthough our sample contains one red giant at a large (western)\ndistance with a radial velocity that is higher by 3.8 \u0005 than the\nFig. 3.\u2014Distributions of individual radial velocities (top) andmean radial velocities (bottom) as a function of theirmajor-axis distance. The symbols in the top panels are the\nsame as in Fig. 1, while the small dots additionally depict the 33 data points fromM98. The solid horizontal line indicates the global mean of our sample, while the dashed lines\ndenote the formal King radius at 12.60.\nKOCH ET AL.246 Vol. 657\nsample mean, there is no apparent tendency of a systematically\nlower mean velocity of the targets at large distances toward the\neast.\nWhile we find amean radial velocity of 294:3 \u0006 2:9 km s\u00011 for\nthe stars outside the formal tidal radius on the eastern side, the value\nfor the stars toward the western half including (rejecting) the high-\nvelocity outlier amounts to 289:5 \u0006 4:0 (285:7 \u0006 5:5) km s\u00011.\nFrom this point of view our data do not show any hint of signif-\nicant rotation, nor an asymmetry of the velocities on either side\nalong the galaxy\u2019s major axis.\nSecondly, we calculated the difference in mean velocity on\neither side of bisecting lines passing through each of the targets,\nassuming that each such line is a potential rotation axis. The axis\nyielding the maximummean velocity difference is then taken as\nthe \u2018\u2018rotation axis,\u2019\u2019 with the associated velocity difference being\nan estimate of the amplitude of the rotation. Figure 4 shows the\nresulting velocity differences for our data set. Due to the confine-\nment of our GMOS fields to the eastern half of Leo I, we cannot\nperform any test for rotation in this subsample alone. However,\nbased on only the 56 candidatemembers fromDEIMOS,wefind a\nmaximum velocity difference of 1.2 km s\u00011. Nevertheless, the\nspatial distribution of these stars does not allow one to unambigu-\nously determine a potential rotation axis (see top panel of Fig. 4). In\nthe case of the combined GMOS and DEIMOS sample, the am-\nplitude of the potential rotation reaches a value of 5.2 km s\u00011\n(middle panel of Fig. 4). When also the 33 stars from M98 are\nadded, the mean velocity difference changes to 3.0 km s\u00011 (bottom\npanel of Fig. 4). It isworth noticing that in both of the latter cases the\naxis of themaximum rotation signal occurs at a position angle (78\u0004,\n80\u0004) that coincides with Leo I\u2019s position angle of 79\u0004 \u0006 3\u0004 (Irwin\n& Hatzidimitriou 1995).\nIn order to test the significance of these results, we constructed\n104 random samples of radial velocities at the observed spatial\npositions. The velocities were taken from a normal distribution\nwith the samemean and standard deviation as in our observations,\nadditionally allowing for a variation due to the measurement un-\ncertainty. By means of this Monte Carlo simulation we find that\nthe significance of the rotation in the DEIMOS sample is con-\nsistent with zero, whereas the amplitudes of the combined GMOS\nplus DEIMOS data sets and the full data including M98\u2019s stars\namount to a significance of 86.7% (1.5 \u0005) and 20% (0.3 \u0005), re-\nspectively. Thus, the rotational signature we detected appears\nnot to be statistically significant in either case. Consequently,\nwe have no evidence of any kinematical effect due to Galactic\ntides operating on Leo I.\nAnother cause of apparent rotation is relative transverse mo-\ntion. Unfortunately, there is no estimate of Leo I\u2019s proper motion\navailable in the literature at present. Hence, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that the amount of observed rotation is entirely due to\nthe relativemotion between the Sun and the dSph, v rel(l; b), in the\ngalactocentric rest frame. A nonrotating object will appear to ro-\ntate as seen in the heliocentric rest frame, provided that there is a\nsignificant gradient in this relative motion across the dSph (see\nWalker et al. 2006a).We can attempt the inverse calculation: we\ntested whether one can constrain Leo I\u2019s true proper motion by\ndemanding that this galaxy does not rotate but the entire amplitude\nof the observed velocity gradient is caused by such projection ef-\nfects. For this purpose, we calculated the galactocentric rest-frame\nvelocity of each star through the formalism provided in Piatek et al.\n(2002) and Walker et al. (2006a). This was done for a wide grid\nof assumed propermotions, corresponding to transverse velocities\nfrom \u0001500 to +500 km s\u00011 in both \u0001l and \u0001b. Regrettably, the\nFig. 4.\u2014Tests for rotation in different subsamples of our data (as labeled): shown is the mean velocity difference with respect to rotation around axes at the respective\nposition angles. A rotation signal around the major axis (at P:A: \u0003 79\u0004) is distinguishable, but its significance is marginal. See text for a detailed discussion.\nSTELLAR KINEMATICS AND METALLICITIES IN LEO I 247No. 1, 2007\nfull range of input (\u0001l, \u0001b) was able to reproduce the observed ap-\nparent rotation amplitude adequately, so no deductions are possible.\nWe then reran the same formalism by adopting a toy distance of\n50 kpc to Leo I and secondly assumed its line-of-sight velocity\nas zero. In both cases the parameter space of possible proper\nmotions increased even more. In consequence, neither can we\nunequivocally exclude the possibility that Leo I\u2019s observed,\nalthough insignificant, velocity gradient is purely caused by the\naforementioned projection effects or due to its large distance or\nsystemic velocity, nor can we conclusively restrict its proper\nmotion to a reasonable estimate.\n5. VELOCITY DISPERSION PROFILE\nFrom their sample of 33 stars, M98 reported central velocity\ndispersions ranging from 8:6 \u0006 1:2 to 9:2 \u0006 1:6 km s\u00011, which\nwere obtained using several model-independent estimators. This\nis slightly lower than our global estimate from equation (1), but\nconsistent within the uncertainties.\nWe determined the velocity dispersion profile using the maxi-\nmum likelihoodmethod outlined in Kleyna et al. (2004). The data\nwere binned such as to maintain a constant number of stars per\nbin, where we chose the bin size such that no fewer than 10 stars\nwere included. A Gaussian velocity distribution around the single\nmean velocity of the entire ensemble is then assumed for each\nradial bin, convolved with the observational errors. The mem-\nber velocity distribution centered on the systemic velocity is\nthen combinedwith an interloper distribution,Pint(v), contributing\na fraction fint to each bin. This allows the probability distribu-\ntion of the true dispersion \u0005 in the bin through an extension of\nequation (1):\np vi; \u0005if gj vh i; \u0005\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \/ \u0001i 1\u0001 fint\u00f0 \u00de 1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\u0007 \u00052 \u00fe \u00052i\u00f0 \u00de\np\n\" #\n; exp \u0001 vi \u0001 vh i\u00f0 \u00de\n2\n2 \u00052 \u00fe \u00052i\u00f0 \u00de\n\" #\n\u00fe fintPint v\u00f0 \u00de\n( )\n: \u00f02\u00de\nWe then perform a maximum likelihood fit over \u0005 and fint ,\nmarginalize over the interloper fraction, and finally find the most\nlikely dispersion from the marginalized distribution.\nWe take account of the effects of the Galactic foreground in-\nterlopers in our data set by assuming various associated distribu-\ntions Pint(v) over the whole range of interest around the systemic\nvelocity of Leo I. Consequently, we tested power-law velocity\ndistributions with varying indices against the uniform case and\nagainst each other and found from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)\ntest that the resulting dispersion profiles were practically identical\nat a 100% confidence level. The velocity distribution of the 10\nnonmember stars in our sample itself is best represented by a\npower law with an exponent of \u00010.7 (with a K-S probability of\n93%), whereas the K-S probability that these stars\u2019 velocities\nare uniformly distributed is 52%. We emphasize, however, that\nthe resulting dispersion profiles do not change with respect to\nthe adopted parameterization of the underlying interloper dis-\ntribution. This is also to be expected, given the low total number\nof nonmembers sampled, a consequence of the overall high\nsystemic velocity of Leo I relative to line-of-sight Galactic halo\nstars. We will, for convenience, use the uniform case in the fol-\nlowing. Typically, the peak interloper fraction for the outermost bin\ndoes not exceed 0.1 and is compatible with zero in the inner bins.\nFinally, formal error bounds were determined by numerically\nintegrating the total probability of the data set and finding the\ncorresponding 68% confidence intervals. Figure 5 shows the re-\nsulting velocity dispersion profiles as a function of the projected\nspherical radius for different membership criteria and separately\nfor the subsamples.\n5.1. Radial Variations\nGiven the derived uncertainties in the profiles, the dispersion\nprofile of Leo I can be considered to be approximately flat out to\nthe nominal tidal radius for the majority of the data combinations\nshown. Exclusion of the 3 \u0005 outlier in the last bin leads to only a\nmarginal change. Inclusion of the data from M98 with our own\ndata in the maximum sample decreases the dispersion in the cen-\ntral 30 by \u00032 km s\u00011, while the associated rebinning of the data\nintroduces a small drop in the dispersion beyond 100, quantifying\nthe limited sensitivity of the binned dispersions to sample binning.\n5.2. Absence or Presence of Kinematical Substructure\nLocalized, kinematical structures in LG dSphs have been de-\ntected, specifically in the form of low velocity dispersion (cold)\nspatially clumpy substructure in the UMi dSph (Kleyna et al.\n2003;Wilkinson et al. 2004). In Sextans a low velocity dispersion\n(cold) central core has been found (Kleyna et al. 2004), and in-\ndependently the presence of an off-centered kinematically dis-\ntinct subpopulation has been reported (Walker et al. 2006b). Such\ndistinct cold features can be interpreted as the remains of dis-\npersing star clusters, with their central locations arising due to\nthe clusters being dragged toward the inner regions by dynamical\nfriction (Kleyna et al. 2003, 2004; Goerdt et al. 2006). An alter-\nnative proposal involves the after effects of a merger between a\ndSph and an even smaller system (Coleman et al. 2004).\nDespite the overall flatness of Leo I\u2019s velocity dispersion to-\nward larger radii, the profile does show some radial structure. A\nnoteworthy radial feature is an apparent rise in the dispersion pro-\nfile at \u000330 (r\/rtid \u0003 0:25). This trend is persistent, regardless of\nradial binning and the chosen sample, and it is also inherent in\nthe profile observed by Mateo (2005). The major difference be-\ntween our profile and the one reported in Mateo (2005) is that his\ndispersion rises continuously out to 10.50 after having reached its\nminimum after the bump. Hence, it cannot be excluded a priori\nthat the local dispersion maximum may in fact be localized and\nphysically real.\nIn order to test whether our data set supports the presence of any\nunderlying localized kinematical substructure, we estimate the\nposition-dependent dispersion using a nonparametric approach.\nWe define the locally weighted, average dispersion as\n\u0005 x; y\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nPN\ni\u00bc1 vi \u0001 vh i\u00f0 \u00de2\u0001 \u00052i\nh i\nK x; xi; y; yi; h\u00f0 \u00dePN\ni\u00bc1 K x; xi; y; yi; h\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f03\u00de\n(Walker et al. 2006b, after Nadaraya 1964; Watson 1964). Here\nvi and \u0005i are as usual the observed radial velocities and asso-\nciated uncertainties of the N targets at the location (xi, yi). The\nsmoothing kernel K is characterized by its smoothing band-\nwidth h, which we adopted as variable such as to include a fixed\nnumber n of stars within 3h at each location (x, y). For conve-\nnience in comparing our analyses, we follow the prescription of\nWalker et al. (2006b) in adopting a bivariate Gaussian kernel;\nhence, K \/ exp (\u00011\n2\nf\u00bd(x\u0001 xi)2 \u00fe ( y\u0001 yi)2\u0007\/h2g). The number\nof nearest neighbors n was chosen sufficiently high to yield a\nstatistically significant estimate of each local dispersion measure-\nment, but sufficiently low so that any real spatial information\nwould not be averaged out. Hence, we varied n from 5 to 30,\ncorresponding to at most about 25% of the entire sample size.\nKOCH ET AL.248 Vol. 657\nThe significance of any potential substructure in our data was\nthen determined via detailed Monte Carlo modeling. For this pur-\npose, 103 random data sets were generated, where the (x, y) coor-\ndinates of our targets were preserved, but the observed velocities\nand error estimates were permuted with respect to their position. In\nthis way, the sample mean and dispersion were retained, whereas\nany spatial information was dissolved. For each of these random\ndata sets, the spatial dispersion distribution (eq. [3]) and its maxima\nand minima were determined. The significance phot ( pcold) of hot\n(cold) substructures at each spatial point was then defined by the\nfraction of random data sets with a maximum (minimum) dis-\npersion, which is lower (higher) than the actual observed local\ndispersion \u0005(x; y) (see Walker et al. 2006b).\nWe do not find evidence of any localized cold substructure with\nlow radial velocity dispersions in our data (see Fig. 6). In both the\nGMOS+DEIMOS data sets of Leo I and after inclusion of M98\ntargets, the significance of cold structures, pcold, does not exceed\n50% for any choice of the number of neighboring points. The\ntypical value of this significance lies at 30%.\nOn the other hand, the presence of a physically real local max-\nimum in the radial dispersion profile could indicate the presence of\na locally hot structure at radii of \u000330Y40. Although the probabil-\nities for an occurrence of hot substructure increase toward the\nnominal tidal radius, where the data are only sparsely distributed,\nthe formal significances phot are generally well below the 80%\nlevel. Hence, the apparent localized kinematical structure is con-\nsistent with statistical fluctuations about a constant dispersion\nvalue at the 1 \u0005 level. In particular, there is no significant evidence\nof any localized structure at the radii in question: at loci between 30\nand 40, the probability of an occurrence of any dynamically hot\nsubstructure is less than 15% for any reasonable choice of n.\nSince the submission of our paper, S06 and Bosler et al. (2006)\nhave presented kinematic data sets for Leo I. An analysis of the\ncombined data sets (also including our data and those of M98),\nwhich yields a sample of the order of 400 red giant velocities,\nwill aid the investigation of the full kinematical structure of Leo I\nand is currently underway.\nFromour data, we conclude that the apparent rise in the velocity\ndispersion profile does not exclude the presence of any kine-\nmatical substructure, but it is probably not a localized feature.\n5.3. (Non-)Influence of Binaries\nThe presence of a significant population of binaries in any\nkinematical data set leads to an inflation of the observed ve-\nlocity distribution, or, in other words, the true line-of-sight ve-\nlocity dispersion of a stellar system is smaller than the observed\ndispersion, as soon as a nonzero binary fraction is considered.\nMoreover, the high-velocity tail of a binary distribution drives a\ndistribution function away from Gaussian, so that an oversimple\ndetermination tends to produce larger errors in the derived ve-\nlocity dispersion, which in turn may reduce the statistical sig-\nnificance of any real radial gradient in the dispersion profile (see\nerror bars in Fig. 6). Fortunately, the effect of binary stars has\nbeen shown to be negligible in dSphs in the past. Hargreaves et al.\n(1996) could effectively show by using Monte Carlo simulations\nthat the velocity dispersion caused by pure binary orbits is small\ncompared with the generally large observed dispersions in dSphs,\nprovided that the ensemble of orbital parameters in the dSph stars\nis similar to the distribution in the solar neighborhood. Likewise,\nOlszewski et al. (1996) concluded from their simulations that\nnone of the kinematical estimates in the UMi and Draco dSphs\nsignificantly change under the influence of binary stars. This\nFig. 5.\u2014Velocity dispersion profile for different subsamples, as labeled, and rejection cuts.

(2006a)\nconclude from their repeat observation of red giant velocities in\nthe Fornax dSph that the impact of binaries on the measured ve-\nlocity dispersion is negligible. These observed kinematics did not\nshow any evidence that would support an overall binary content\nlarger than 40%.Moreover, the dynamically significant fraction in\nthe Draco sample amounted to less than 5%. In the case of Leo I,\nGallart et al. (1999a) argued from their modeled SFH based on\ndeep Hubble Space Telescope (HST ) color-magnitude diagrams\n(CMDs) that it is unlikely that the total binary fraction in this gal-\naxy exceeds 60%, again with a far lower dynamically significant\nnumber.\nIn order to explore the importance of binaries for the velocity\ndispersion profile of Leo I, we added an additional term to equa-\ntion (2), accounting for a binary star distribution Pb(v), which is\nthen convolved with the observed velocity distribution, in ac-\ncordance with equation (1) of Kleyna et al. (2002). The binary\nprobability distribution Pb(v) was adopted from Kleyna et al.\n(2002) and is based on the velocity measurements of Duquennoy\n& Mayor (1991) for a sample of solar-type primary stars in the\nsolar neighborhood. Kleyna et al. (2002) then obtained a realistic\ndistribution by taking into account the giant branch binary evo-\nlution through circularization of the orbits.\nWe note that the presence of a nonzero binary fraction does\nnot alter the derived interloper fraction, which is still consistent\nwith zero ( less than 5% in the outermost bin). Figure 7 shows\nvelocity dispersion profiles obtained under the assumption of\ndifferent binary fractions. The average error bar on the velocity\ndispersionmeasurements increases by 10% for a binary fraction\nof 0.4 and by 25% for an implausibly large fb of 0.8. Likewise,\nthe overall decrease of the dispersion profiles is, with less than\n0.7 km s\u00011 deviation for 40% binaries, well below the 0.5 \u0005 level.\nAn increase of fb leads to a progressively more pronounced\nfalloff of the underlying dispersion profiles. Nonetheless, the ve-\nlocity dispersion profile assuming 40% binaries is consistent\nwith that using no binaries at the 90% confidence level, as con-\nfirmed by a K-S test, so that henceforth the effect of binaries on\nour observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles is taken\nto be negligible.\n6. ISOTROPIC MASS ESTIMATES\nThe simplest possible estimate of the mass profiles of dSphs\nuses single-component dynamical models, in which it is assumed\nthat the mass distribution follows that of the visible component\n(\u2018\u2018mass follows light;\u2019\u2019 e.g., Richstone & Tremaine 1986). In\nthis context, King models (King 1966) were often used to describe\nboth the surface density and the velocity dispersion profile. How-\never, the parameters describing the visible content of dSphs, i.e.,\ncore radius rc and velocity dispersion profile \u0005, are in all cases\nstudied in detail inconsistent with the mass-follows-light assump-\ntion inherent in this style of analysis (Kormendy & Freeman\n2004). In the case here, where the approximately flat observed\ndispersion profile of Leo I suggests that the stars orbit in a (dark\nmatter) halo that extends to radii larger than the nominal tidal\nradius of the observed light distribution, this historical approach is\ninappropriate. Where sufficient data exist, two-parameter dynami-\ncal models for spherical stellar systems (Pryor & Kormendy 1990;\nKleyna et al. 2002), additionally accounting for velocity aniso-\ntropies and a dark matter component or nonparametric modeling\nschemes (Wang et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2006a), are progres-\nsively being applied to reproduce observed profiles, in particular\nout to large radii.\nWhere only limited data exist, sufficient to define a binned\ndispersion profile but insufficient to support a full dynamical\nanalysis of the distribution function, an intermediate level of\nanalysis is appropriate and is applied here. We pursued a simple\napproach to obtain an estimate of the galaxy\u2019s mass and density\nFig. 6.\u2014Top: Radial velocity dispersion estimator according to eq.

Both of these quantities are obtained via direct deprojection\nof the observed surface brightness, I(r), and projected dispersion\nprofile \u0005(r) adopting a convenient functional form, which in this\ncase is a Plummer model (Wilkinson et al. 2006a, after Binney &\nTremaine 1987).

Since\nthe observed velocity dispersion profile, on the other hand, ap-\npears to be consistent with being flat, we fit this component with\na Plummer profile with a large-scale radius of 740 to ensure a flat\nshape throughout the observed radius (right panels of Fig. 8).\nHowever, as Figure 8 indicates, this argument is slightly sen-\nsitive to the value of the outer bin, which may give rise to a fall-\noff in the profile. Hence, we also chose a Plummer profile with a\nsmaller radius (360), which fits the observations best. In either\ncase, the central value of the velocity dispersion \u00050 was deter-\nmined as 9.8 km s\u00011. These values hold only for the combined\nGMOS+DEIMOS sample. The inclusion of M98\u2019s data leads to\na decreased central velocity dispersion and consequently yields\na lower central density \u00020. The resulting density profiles in Fig-\nure 9 fall off faster in the case that Leo I has a falling dispersion\nprofile. Either density profile reaches an r\u00011 slope at \u000330, but\nunder the assumption of a flat velocity dispersion the density\nconverges to the r\u00012 law (linearly rising mass), whereas it tends\nto be consistent with an r\u00012.5: : :r\u00013 behavior toward the nominal\ntidal radius for the falling dispersion profile.\nAs discussed above, our data suggest a rising feature in our\nvelocity dispersion profile at approximately 30. Although it has\nbeen shown above that this is not a statistically significant local-\nized structure, it may be physically real and so provide useful\nconstraints on the dark matter mass distribution in Leo I. Conse-\nquently, we consider this particular shape by fitting the dispersion\nprofile with an additional asymmetric Gaussian component of the\nform \u0005bump \/ 10\u0001\u0003r exp (\u000110(r\u0001\u0001)\/p) overlaid on the Plummer\nprofiles. The free parameters \u0003, \u0001, and p are then determined in\na least-squares sense. Using this best-fit representation in the dy-\nnamical calculations results in an unphysical behavior in the re-\nsulting mass profile, i.e., a drop in the cumulative mass and the\ndensity profile at the location of the bump (left panels of Fig. 9).\nThis is attributed to a too steep rise in the additional component as\nopposed to the smooth decline toward larger radii. Hence, the as-\nsociated gradient, which enters the Jeans equation, overwhelms\nthe gradient of the declining portion in the dispersion and light\nprofiles, leading to a negative contribution in the derived mass\nprofile. We note that varying the parameters of the Gaussian peak,\nFig. 9.\u2014Mass (top) and density (bottom) estimates from Jeans equations, assuming an isotropic velocity distribution. The left panels each refer to the GMOS+DEIMOS\nsample,whereas the right panels additionally account for theM98 data set. Different line types signify different approaches to fit the observed dispersion profile (see Fig. 8). The\nunphysical drop in the profiles of the left panels is due to the inclusion of an additional peak in the best-fit velocity dispersion profile, which exhibits a steep rising gradient in\nthe inner regions opposed to a slower decline of the underlying Plummer profiles. These counteracting gradients are not as distinct after inclusion of the M98 sample so that\nthe right panels do not display this drop.\nKOCH ET AL.252 Vol. 657\nretaining consistency with the GMOS+DEIMOS profile, does not\nremove this inconsistency. Conversely, a comparable fit to the\nGMOS+DEIMOS+M98 data does not exhibit this unphysical\noutcome, since for the respective best-fit profile the gradient in the\ninnermost regions does not counteract the gradient of the more\ngradually declining profile at larger radii. We conclude that the\nfailure of such a basic functional approach to simultaneously yield\na physically expedient representation of all profiles considered\nsuggests that we in fact do not see a real substructure. If, on the\nother hand, the dispersion profile could be modeled sufficiently\nwell in either case and the radial feature was assumed to reflect a\nreal structure, its particular shape would result in a close to uni-\nform density profile at central radii. This would be indicative of\na central core in Leo I. We explore the plausibility of cored mass\nprofiles in the next section.\nThe upper and lower mass and central density limits were finally\nderived by determining a profile that reproduced the observed ve-\nlocity dispersion profile within the measurement uncertainties\non either side. An estimate of Leo I\u2019s mass thus yields Mtot \u00bc\n(8 \u0006 2) ; 107 M\u0002 enclosed within the King radius of 12.60, cor-\nresponding to 0.9 kpc at the distance of Leo I. The exact values\ndepend on the choice of the formal representation of the line-of-\nsight velocity dispersion profile and are detailed in Table 4.\nSimilarly, the central density is found to be \u00020 \u00bc (2:8 \u0006 0:8) ;\n108 M\u0002 kpc\u00013, which is, in the light of the measurement uncer-\ntainties, consistent with the value of (3:4 \u0006 0:9) ; 108 M\u0002 kpc\u00013\nobtained by M98 from single-component King fitting. The avail-\nable dynamical mass estimates for dSphs yield total masses out\nto the radial limits of the respective kinematic data in the range\nof (3Y8) ; 107 M\u0002 (e.g.,Mateo 1998;Wilkinson et al. 2004, 2006a;\nKleyna et al. 2004; Chapman et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2006a).\nThis places Leo I in the upper range of known LG dSphmasses.\nAdopting a total luminosity of L \u00bc (3:4 \u00061:1) ; 106 L\u0002 (Irwin\n& Hatzidimitriou), we find an isotropic mass-to-light ratio of\n(M \/L)tot \u00bc (24 \u0006 6) (M \/L)\u0002 (see Table 4). This value is 3 times\nlarger than the central value quoted byM98, who obtained their\nestimate based on analyses of the galaxy\u2019s core region and adopted\na higher luminosity of L \u00bc 4:9 ; 106 L\u0002. If we adopt this latter\nvalue for L, we obtain an (M \/L)tot of 17 (M\/L)\u0002. Moreover, S06\nderive an estimate of 5.3 (M\/L)\u0002, again with an underlying higher\ntotal luminosity of 7:6 ; 106 L\u0002 and based on core fitting and their\nvalue of the central velocity dispersion.\nIn Figure 10 we plot the V-band mass-to-light ratios versus\nV-band luminosities of the knownGalactic dSphs, including some\nof the recently discovered systems, like UrsaMajor (Willman et al.\n2005) and Boo\u00a8tes (Belokurov et al. 2006), plus two of the M31\ncompanions with published masses. In particular, we adopted mass\nestimates fromMateo (1998) for Leo II and Sculptor, whereasmore\nrecentmeasurements were used for the other satellites (And II, Co\u02c6te\u00b4\net al. 1999; UMi and Draco, Wilkinson et al. 2004; Ursa Major,\nKleyna et al. 2005; And lX, Chapman et al. 2005; Fornax,Wang\net al. 2005; Carina and Sextans, Wilkinson et al. 2006a; Boo\u00a8tes,\nMun\u02dcoz et al. 2006a).\nThe idea that dSphs may be dominated by dark matter out to\nlarge radii raises the intriguing questionwhether all of these dwarf\ngalaxies could be enclosed in comparable dark matter halos of\nsimilar total mass, as first pointed out byMateo et al. (1993). This\nfeature would then argue in favor of an intimate relation between\nthe dark matter halos of the dSph systems. Moreover, cosmo-\nlogical simulations suggest that it is possible that there is a min-\nimum mass for a dark matter halo that contains stars (e.g., Read\net al. 2006a and references therein). It is also an interesting question\nto ask whether all of the dSphs have similar mass halos, as this\nmight tell us something about the properties of the dark matter.\nUnder such an assumption, the halos can be represented by the\nsimple relation\nM=L\u00f0 \u00detot \u00bc M=L\u00f0 \u00de\b\u00fe MDM=L; \u00f06\u00de\nwhere (M \/L)\b is the intrinsic mass-to-light ratio of the stellar com-\nponent in the galaxy,MDM denotes themass of the darkmatter halo,\nand L is the integrated luminosity in the V band (M98; Wilkinson\net al. 2006a). It is realistic to assume that theM\/L of the luminous\ncomponent in dSphs is of the order of the mean value observed\nin low-concentration globular clusters, which are characterized\nby low values implying no dark matter (Pryor et al. 1991; Moore\n1996; Dubath&Grillmair 1997;M98;Baumgardt et al. 2005).We\ndo not correct the observedM\/L ratios for the (small) effects of\nTABLE 4\nMass and Central Density Estimates\nSample Dispersion Profile\nM (r < rtid)\n(107 M\u0002)\n\u00020\n(108 M\u0002 kpc\u00013)\n(M\/LV)\n[(M\/LV)\u0002]\nGMOS+DEIMOS......................

As the best-fit dashed line\nin Figure 10 implies, the observed dSphs scatter around the ex-\npected relation for a population of luminous objects that are\nembedded in a dark halo with a common mass scale of the order\nof 3 ; 107 M\u0002. Considering the generally large scatter in such an\n(M\/L)-MV diagram, Leo I fits well into the global picture and\napparently is governed by the same uniform dark halo proper-\nties. It is hence worth noticing that Figure 10 demonstrates that\nthe narrow range of dSph velocity dispersions of 6Y10 km s\u00011,\ncombined with their rather similar physical length scales, can\ngenerally be interpreted in terms of a commonmass scale so that\nthis kinematical piece of information can reliably be used as a proxy\nfor an overall underlyingmass distribution (see alsoWilkinson et al.\n2006a).\n7. VELOCITY ANISOTROPY\nThe mass estimates derived above are based on the assumption\nof an isotropic velocity distribution; i.e., the velocity anisotropy\nparameter \t \u00bc 1\u0001 hv 2\n i\/hv 2r i was assumed to be zero. However,\nmost of the kinematic studies of dSphs have revealed that a non-\nnegligible amount of anisotropy is required to account for the shapes\nof the galaxies and the observed dispersion profiles (xokas 2001,\n2002; Kleyna et al. 2002; Wilkinson et al. 2004). Since the neglect\nof a nonzero anisotropy has the effect of under- or overestimating\nthe dark halo mass, we also consider this problem by solving the\nJeans equation\nd \bv 2r\n\u0006 \u0007\ndr\n\u00fe 2\t \bv\n2\nr\nr\n\u00bc \u0001\b d\u0002\ndr\n\u00f07\u00de\nfor a varying \t. Here \b and v 2r denote again the 3D light and\ndispersion profiles, respectively, and \u0002 is the gravitational po-\ntential associated with the underlying mass distribution M (r).\nThe actual observable quantity, the line-of-sight velocity dis-\npersion \u0005, is then obtained by direct integration along the line of\nsight and under the constraints \u0002v 2r ! 0 for r !1 and \t \u00bc\nconst.

By adopting analytical prescriptions for the involved\nfunctions, one can then proceed to derive \u0005 numerically.\nIn concordance with the previous section, we chose to describe\nLeo I\u2019s surface brightness profile I (R) and the associated 3D de-\nprojection with a Plummer profile using the best-fit parameters\nto the observations.We then use two different representations of\nthe mass profileM (r), which enters this formalism, spanning the\nrange of plausible mass distributions.\n7.1. NFW95 Halo Mass Distribution\nBased on high-resolution cosmological simulations, NFW95\ndemonstrated that the density profiles of dark matter halos are well\nfitted by a simple function with a single free parameter, the char-\nacteristic density. This solution has been applied to awide range of\nhalo masses, ranging from galaxy clusters to small scales such as\nthe cosmological dark matter halos associated with the dSphs. On\ntransformation of the variables, the density profile corresponds\nto a mass profile of the form\nM s\u00f0 \u00de\nMv\n\u00bc g c\u00f0 \u00de ln 1\u00fe cs\u00f0 \u00de\u0001 cs\n1\u00fe cs\n\u0004 \u0005\n; \u00f09\u00de\nwhere s \u00bc r\/rv denotes the radial distance in units of the virial\nradius andMv is the mass enclosed within the virial radius. The\nlatter is generally identifiedwith the total mass of the halo. Finally,\nthe concentration parameter c is used to describe the shape of the\nprofile and defines the amplitude function\ng c\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc ln 1\u00fe c\u00f0 \u00de\u0001 c= 1\u00fe c\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0007\u00011: \u00f010\u00de\nFor a detailed discussion of these parameterizations and the model,\nwe refer the reader to NFW95 or xokas &Mamon (2001). Since\nthe NFW95 profile has the unphysical disadvantage of diverging\nat large radii, it is convenient to consider only radii within a certain\ncutoff radius. We follow long-standing practice and assume this\ncutoff to coincide with rv; beyond this point, the overall density\ndistribution becomes unreliable in most natural cases (e.g., xokas\n& Mamon 2001).\nThe concentration c has been shown to scale with mass. Here\nwe adopt an extrapolation of the formulae derived in the N-body\nsimulations for \u0003CDM cosmology of Jing & Suto (2000) to the\nsmall masses of dwarf galaxies. Hence,\nc \u00bc 10:23 hMv\n1012 M\u0002\n\b \t\u00010:088\n; \u00f011\u00de\nwhere h denotes theHubble constant in units of 100 km s\u00011Mpc\u00011.\nIn concordance with current cosmological results, we use h \u00bc 0:7\nfor the remainder of thiswork. Likewise, the virial radius is related\nto the virial mass via\nrv \u00bc 206 Mv\n1012 M\u0002\n\b \t1=3\nkpc\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f012\u00de\nThis leavesMv and the anisotropy \t (assumed to be constant) as\nthe only free parameters to be determined in a fit of the NFW95\nmodel profile to the observations.\nAs Figure 11 (top panel) implies, none of the values for the\nanisotropy that we have considered yield an adequate fit of the\noverall dispersion profile. It rather appears that a progressively\nradial anisotropy is needed to explain the observations at larger\nradii, whereas the inner parts of the velocity dispersion are best\nrepresented by an isotropic velocity tensor. It is worth noticing\nthat the innermost bin, with a smaller value for the dispersion in\nthe sample after inclusion of the M98 data points, may suggest\nthe presence of some tangential anisotropy in the innermost\nregions. However, based on the observations, \t is unlikely to\nfall below \u00010.5. For the four different \t curves that we tested\n(i.e., \u00010.5, 0, 0.5, 1), we obtained reduced \u00062 values of (0.2,\n0.16, 0.22, 0.78). The final best fit in terms of a minimized \u00062\nwas achieved for \t \u00bc 0:05 so that the overall profiles are in\nagreement with an isotropic velocity distribution. The resultant\nbest-fit total virial mass isMv \u00bc 1:0 ; 109 M\u0002, with a correspond-\ning virial radius of rv \u00bc 21 kpc and a concentration c \u00bc 19:4.\nFurthermore, the mass within the nominal observed tidal radius\namounts to 7:7 ; 107 M\u0002. It is, unsurprisingly given the near-\nisotropic distribution deduced, in good agreement with the value\nobtained under the assumption of a purely isotropic velocity\ndistribution.\nKOCH ET AL.254 Vol. 657\n7.2. Cored Halo Profile\nThe density profile that we obtained under the assumption of\nvelocity isotropy appears to be indicative of a flat, close to uniform\ndensity core at small radii (see bottom panels of Fig. 9). In con-\njunction with the observational indications of cored density pro-\nfiles in low-luminosity galaxies and in particular in some of the\ndSphs (xokas 2002; Kleyna et al. 2003; Strigari et al. 2006;\nWilkinson et al. 2006a), this prompted us to also consider this\nparticular density distribution in our calculations of Leo I\u2019s dis-\npersion profile (eq. [7]). We parameterize the cored density profile\nin terms of a generalized Hernquist profile (Hernquist 1990; Zhao\n1996; Read & Gilmore 2005) as\n\u0002(r) \u00bc C r\nrs\n\b \t\u0001\u000b\n1\u00fe r\nrs\n\b \t\u0003\u0004 \u0005(\u000b\u00013)=\u0003\n; \u00f013\u00de\nwhere C is a normalization constant, rs is a scale radius, \u000b is the\nlog slope of the density profile within rs, and \u0003 determines the\nsmoothness of the transition toward the density profile at larger\nradii. The case of \u0003 \t 1 has often been discussed and fitted to\ndispersion profiles in the literature, since it allows one to envisage\na broad class of dark matter halo representations (Jing & Suto\n2000; xokas 2002). A slope of \u000b > 0 then corresponds to the\ncuspy halos, where NFW95-like profiles as discussed above are\nrepresented by \u000b \u00bc 1. The opposing class of models with a cored\nhalo is realized by \u000b \u00bc 0.\nIt turns out that a least-squares fit under the constraint \u0003 \u00bc 1\nyields an unsatisfactory representation of our observations. Thus,\nwe chose to use the profile according to equation (13) in our fits,\nleaving C, rs, \u0003, and \u000b as free parameters. The resulting param-\neters of rs \u00bc 0:3 kpc, \u0003 \u00bc 1:6, and \u000b \u00bc 0 improved the reduced\n\u00062 from 55 (three-parameter fit) to 13 (four parameters). It is\nworth noticing that indeed the best fit was obtained for a pure core\nprofile (\u000b \t 0). Figure 11 (bottom panel ) displays the resulting\nradial velocity dispersion profiles for varying degrees of (con-\nstant) anisotropy.\nAs for the case of the cuspy dark halo treated above, we find\nthat our observed velocity dispersion is broadly consistent with an\nisotropic velocity distribution, where the best fit yielded a \t of\n0.05. Still, the observations allow for a wider range in the an-\nisotropy, from \u00010.5 to 0.5. In this context, a slight amount of\ntangential anisotropy can account for the shape of the profile\ntoward the inner regions, whereas significant radial anisotropy\nis ruled out at all radii. The values for the associated reduced \u00062\nstatistics for the cored halo are (0.39, 0.25, 0.40, 1.94) for re-\nspective \t-values of (\u00010.5, 0, 0.5, 1).\nFinally, we also adopted a radially varying anisotropy in our\ncalculations, where we parameterized \t according to the traditional\nprescriptions by Osipkov (1979) andMerrit (1985) as \tOM(r) \u00bc\nr 2\/(r 2 \u00fe r 2a ), where ra denotes the anisotropy radius, at which\nthe transition from isotropic to radial orbits occurs (see alsoxokas\n2002). Under the assumption of a cored density profile and this\nparticular \t(r), we can fit our observed line-of-sight velocity dis-\npersion profile fairly well (see the thick solid line in Fig. 11,\nbottom panel). The best fit (at a \u00062 of 0.02) is then obtained for an\nanisotropy radius of ra \u00bc 0:13 kpc. In particular, the resulting\ncurve is able to account for the observed rising shape of the profile\ndiscussed in x 5.2, albeit by requiring a considerable amount of\nradial anisotropy at relatively small radii.\nAnother possible explanation of the dispersion profile of\nLeo I might be the presence of two stellar components with dif-\nferent length scales and associated different velocity dispersions.\nMcConnachie et al. (2006) have recently presented dispersion\nprofiles derived for such a system. Their profiles bear a striking\nresemblance to that of Leo I and might account for the initial rise\nin the projected dispersion.\nIn concluding we note that the enclosed mass within the tidal\nradius amounts to 8:5 ; 107 M\u0002 under the assumption of a cored\nhalo in Leo I. This value is larger than under the assumption of\nan NFW95-like mass distribution, but still in agreement with\nthe numbers derived from the Jeans equations above.\n8. THE METALLICITY OF LEO I\nThe observed wavelength region in the near-infrared and our\nspectral resolution, coupled with the S\/N of our observations, also\nenabled us to get an estimate of the red giants\u2019 metallicities from\nthe equivalent widths (EWs) of the Ca triplet (CaT). This pro-\ncedure succeeded for 58 of the radial velocity member stars tar-\ngeted with GMOS, all of which lie well within the nominal tidal\nradius. For the remainder of our targets, the S\/N did not allowus to\nreliably measure EWs, where a lower limit for these measure-\nments was S\/N \u000310.\n8.1. Calibration of the Metallicity Scale\nThe prominent Ca ii feature may be calibrated onto global\nmetallicities since the line strength is a linear function of met-\nallicity for red giants. By defining a reduced width W 0, which\naccounts for the luminosity difference between the targeted star\nFig. 11.\u2014Predicted velocity dispersion profiles with varying degree of an-\nisotropy (\t) for two different halo density profiles, namely, cuspy (\u2018\u2018NFW95;\u2019\u2019 top\npanel ) and a cored halo (bottom panel ). The inner regions are consistent with\nisotropic orbits, whereas the outer regions do not rule out a certain amount of radial\nanisotropy. The bottom panel also contains a line for the case of a radial varying\nanisotropy parameter, \tOM, after Osipkov (1979) and Merrit (1985), which rep-\nresents our data reasonably well.\nSTELLAR KINEMATICS AND METALLICITIES IN LEO I 255No. 1, 2007\nand the horizontal branch (HB) of the system, one can effectively\nremove any dependence on stellar gravity, effective temperature,\nand distance. Thus, the CaT has become a well-defined calibrator\nfor assessing the metallicity for old, globular clusterYlike pop-\nulations (Armandroff & Da Costa 1991; Rutledge et al. 1997a,\n1997b). Consequently, the derived line widths are generally\ncalibrated onto reference scales for globular clusters of known\nmetallicities (Zinn & West 1984, hereafter ZW84; Carretta &\nGratton 1997, hereafter CG97; Kraft & Ivans 2003). Leo I has a\nprominent old population (e.g., Held et al. 2000), but its dom-\ninant populations are of intermediate age (e.g., Gallart et al.\n1999a, 1999b). Nonetheless, we can still apply the CaT technique,\nsince Cole et al. (2004) have extended its calibration to younger\nages. These authors demonstrated that the CaT technique can be\nusedwithin an age range from 2.5 to 13 Gyr and for a metallicity\nrange spanning \u00012 < \u00bdFe\/H \u0007 < \u00010:2. Since our Leo I obser-\nvations aimed primarily at measuring accurate radial velocities,\nwe did not target any globular clusters, which could have been\nused as calibration standards for the CaT technique. Hence, we\nhad to rely on standard calibrations devised in the literature.\nFollowing long-standing practice, we employed the definition\nof Rutledge et al. (1997b) for the line strength of the CaT as the\nweighted sum of the EWs, giving lower weight to the weaker\nlines:\n\u0004W \u00bc 0:5W8498 \u00feW8542 \u00fe 0:6W8662: \u00f014\u00de\nFor a few of the spectra the Ca line at 84988was too weak to be\naccurately measured or was hampered by too low an S\/N over\nthe respective bandpass. In this case we used a relation derived\nfrom the high-S\/N spectral measurements of a sample of Ga-\nlactic globular clusters from Koch et al. (2006):\n\u0004W \u00bc 1:13 W8542 \u00fe 0:6W8662\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 0:04: \u00f015\u00de\nThis relation was applied to the low-quality spectra where only\nthe two strongest lines had S\/N >10. Rutledge et al. (1997b)\ndefined the reduced width as\nW 0 \u00bc \u0004W \u00fe 0:64 \u00060:02\u00f0 \u00de V \u0001 VHB\u00f0 \u00de;\nwhere \u0004W denotes the CaT line strength and VHB is the mag-\nnitude of the horizontal branch of Leo I. For Leo I, the HB\nluminosity is 22:60 \u0006 0:12 mag according to Held et al. (2001),\nwho measured it based on this galaxy\u2019s RR Lyrae population.\nThe final calibration of the reduced width in terms of stellar\nmetallicity is then obtained via the linear relation\nFe=H\u00bd \u0007CG \u00bc \u00012:66 \u00060:08\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 0:42 \u00060:02\u00f0 \u00deW 0\n(Rutledge et al. 1997a), where we chose to tie our observations\nto the reference scale of CG97 unless stated otherwise.\nThe EWs of the calcium lines were determined in analogy to\nthe methods described in Koch et al. (2006), i.e., by fitting a\nGaussian plus a Lorentzian profile across the bandpasses de-\nfined in Armandroff & Zinn (1988) and summing up the flux in\nthe theoretical profile. The median formal measurement uncer-\ntainty achieved in this way, incorporating EWmeasurement and\ncalibration errors, is 0.12 dex. However, we note that the intrinsic\naccuracy of the CaT-based metallicity measurements may be sig-\nnificantly lower. For instance, variations in the HB level of a com-\nposite stellar system with both age and metallicity can give rise to\na systematic error of the order of 0.05Y0.1 dex (Cole et al. 2004).\nMoreover, the general incompatibility between the [Ca\/Fe] ratio\nin dSphs and the Galactic globular clusters adopted as calibrators is\nanother source of uncertainty.High-resolution abundance studies of\nred giants in dSphs have shown that their \u0003-element abundance\nratios lie significantly below those in Galactic halo stars at com-\nparable metallicities (e.g., Venn et al. 2004), and also the two\nred giants observed in Leo I by Shetrone et al. (2003) follow this\ntrend of \u0003-deficiency. Moreover, the low-resolution studies of\nBosler et al. (2006) underscore these low abundance ratios as\ncompared to the halo. The systematic uncertainties resulting from\nsuch a priori unknown variations in [Ca \/Fe] for our targets can\nreach up to 0.2 dex (e.g., Koch et al. 2006). It isworth noticing that\nsuch effects can be overcome in future studies by calibrating the\nreduced width directly onto [Ca \/H] (Bosler et al. 2006), thus\ncircumventing any dependence of the calibrations of the gal-\naxy\u2019s SFH, in contrast to the currently employed method.\n8.2. Metallicity Distribution\nFigure 12 shows the resulting histogram of our metallicity es-\ntimates. The MDF is clearly peaked at a median metallicity of\n\u00011:31 \u0006 0:02 dex on the scale of CG97, with a measurement\nerror of 0.12 dex (\u00011.61 on the scale of ZW84). This value is in\nexcellent agreement with the study of Bosler et al. (2006), who\nderived a CaT metallicity of\u00011:34 \u0006 0:02 dex (mean measure-\nment error of 0.10) for a sample of 101 red giants (note, how-\never, that the lack of any common targets between the studies of\nBosler et al. [2006] and ours does not allow us to compare\nmeasurements of individual stars). Our results also agree within\nthe uncertainties with the low-resolution studies of Suntzeff et al.\n(1986), who obtained\u00011:9 \u0006 0:2 dex (ZW84). Moreover, they\nare consistent with the estimates from photometric analyses, which\nbroadly agree on ameanmetallicity around\u00011:6 \u0006 0:4 dex (ZW84\nscale; Demers et al. 1994; Bellazzini et al. 2004).\nThe formal 1 \u0005 width of the MDF is 0.25 dex. Taking into\naccount a broadening due to the observational uncertainties, the\nintrinsic metallicity dispersion amounts to 0.22 dex. With a full\nrange in [Fe\/H]CG97 of approximately 1 dex between\u00011.8 and\n\u00010.8 dex (note the most metal-poor star, which we discuss be-\nlow),we observe a smaller spread than is seen in a number of other\ndSphs (Shetrone et al. 2001; Pont et al. 2004; Tolstoy et al. 2004;\nFig. 12.\u2014Metallicity distribution for the 58 GMOS radial velocity member\nstars, for which EWs could be measured. These were convolved by observational\nuncertainties to yield the solid line. Overplotted are a modified simple closed-box\nmodel (SCB; dashed line) and a model using PIE (dot-dashed line), scaled to the\nsame number of stars.\nKOCH ET AL.256 Vol. 657\nKoch et al. 2006), where the MDF may span more than 2 dex and\nexhibits a well-populatedmetal-poor tail. Leo I has been shown to\nexhibit a rather narrow RGB. By means of detailed modeling of\nLeo I\u2019s CMD and in particular of this narrow feature, Gallart et al.\n(1999a) suggested that this might be indicative of the absence of\nany significant chemical enrichment in this dSph. Clearly, the\nspectroscopic data show that this is not correct and that Leo I\nunderwent considerable enrichment of at least 1 dex in total range.\nThere is one object in the sample, No. 774, for which we de-\nrived a CaT-based metallicity of\u00012.61 dex. There is no evidence\nin the spectrum that the line strength of this target has been un-\nderestimated, since its S\/N of \u000345 allowed an accurate determi-\nnation of the triplet\u2019s EWs (see Fig. 13).9 Although weak neutral\nmetal lines around the CaT region do not show up clearly at our\nnominal spectral resolution and are thus mostly blended, there are\nstill some additional absorption features discernible from the noise\n(see Fig. 13). Among these are, for instance, the distinct Fe i blend\nat \u00038514 8 and a visible Fe i line at \u00038689 8. Although clearly\npresent in our stars with highest metallicities, these features are\nhardly detectable in the continuum of the metal-poor candidate.\nBy assuming appropriate line bandpasses around these two iron\nfeatures, we employed the same fitting technique as for the CaT\ndescribed in x 8.1 in order to derive a rough qualitative estimate\nof these lines\u2019 EWs in each of the stars, where possible. From\nthis point of view, No. 774 is well consistent with being a rather\nmetal-poor object, in which these two EWs are practically gov-\nerned by the continuum noise. Furthermore, its location well\nwithin the galactic boundary (2.5 core radii and 0.67 tidal radii,\nrespectively), its consistency with the systemic velocity (99.9%\nconfidence level), and the low interloper fraction around Leo I\u2019s\nradial velocity make it appear unlikely that this star is a contam-\ninating foreground dwarf.\n8.3. Radial Gradients and Implications\nfor Evolutionary Models\nIn those dSphs of the LG, in which both old and intermediate-\nage stellar populations have been detected, the younger compo-\nnents often are more strongly centrally concentrated. In a number\nof dSphs with predominantly old populations, population gra-\ndients have been found in the sense that red HB stars are more\ncentrally concentrated than blue HB stars (e.g., Da Costa et al.\n1996; Hurley-Keller et al. 1999; Harbeck et al. 2001; Tolstoy et al.\n2004), a trend that is mirrored also by the presumablymoremetal-\nrich red giants. However, as also pointed out by Harbeck et al.\n(2001), this trend is not seen in all dSphs.\nSince Leo I hosts dominant intermediate-age populations as\nwell as old populations, one may expect that the more metal-rich\nand presumably younger stars should then also be more concen-\ntrated with respect to a spatially extended metal-poor population.\nOur data suggest, however, that the metal-rich and metal-poor\ncomponents in our MDF are drawn from the same spatial distri-\nbution. This is reflected by the comparison of the cumulative\nradial distributions of the more metal-poor (\u00bdFe\/H \u0007 < 1:3 dex)\nversus themetal-rich (\u00bdFe\/H \u0007 \n 1:3 dex) populations in Figure 14.\nVia a K-S test we could underscore this lack of a radial metallicity\ngradient at the 93% confidence level. This finding is in con-\ncordance with the lack of a considerable population gradient in\nLeo I\u2019s CMD. As was reported by Held et al. (2000), both the\nold HB population and its numerous intermediate-age counterpart\nexhibit essentially the same spatial distribution (see also the bottom\nright panel of Fig. 14). In this respect, Leo I differs fromother dSphs\nwith prominent intermediate-age populations such as Carina (e.g.,\nHarbeck et al. 2001; Koch et al. 2006), Fornax (Grebel 1997;\nStetson et al. 1998), and Leo II (Bellazzini et al. 2005). More-\nover, we find that the kinematics of the metal-poor sample and\nthe kinematics of the more metal-rich sample do not differ sig-\nnificantly, either. This is also in contrast to what is found for dif-\nferent stellar components in many other dSphs (Tolstoy et al.\n2004; Ibata et al. 2006): while the sample with \u00bdFe\/H \u0007 < \u00011:3\nexhibits a dispersion of 9:1 \u0006 2:8 km s\u00011, for those stars with\n\u00bdFe\/H \u0007 \n \u00011:3, \u0005 \u00bc 10:7 \u0006 3:1 km s\u00011, which is an insignif-\nicant difference in the light of the uncertainties.\nThis behavior may indicate that Leo I\u2019s star formation occurred\nfrom a well-mixed reservoir of gas that was little affected by local\naccretion ofmaterial or spatially localized outflows. In this vein, it\nwas suggested byHeld et al. (2000) that the size of this galaxy has\nnot significantly changed and that it is unlikely to have undergone\nsevere structural changes in the course of its evolution, i.e., since\nthe first onset of star formation. In such a model one must assume\nthat external effects such as tides, accretion, orminormergersmay\nnot have played a significant role in Leo I\u2019s history, neither ki-\nnematically nor chemically. On the other hand, S06 claim that the\npreferential periods of SF in Leo I may be linked to perigalactic\npassages, which argues in favor of tidal interactions. Still, without\nextant detailed knowledge of this dSph\u2019s orbit (via propermotions),\nthis has to await further investigation.\nFig. 13.\u2014Spectra of themost metal-poor star in our sample and a typical spectrum of a target around the peakmetallicity. Apart from the three dominant Ca lines, there are a\nfew weak neutral metal lines detectable, which are not distinguishable from the continuum in the more metal-poor target.\n9 We note that this metal-poor regime was not sampled by the globular clusters\nin Rutledge et al. (1997a), so that the determination of suchmetallicities relies on an\nextrapolation of the existing calibrations.\nSTELLAR KINEMATICS AND METALLICITIES IN LEO I 257No. 1, 2007\n8.4. Comparison with Simple Chemical Evolution Models\nPresent-day chemical evolutionary models agree on the fact\nthat dSphs are mainly controlled by low SF efficiencies compared\nto the solar neighborhood and by strong galactic winds of the\norder 10 times the SF rate (Lanfranchi & Matteucci 2004). For\nwant of a detailedmodel prediction of Leo I\u2019sMDF from its SFH,\nwe follow long-standing practice in applying basic models of\nchemical evolution to describe the observations (e.g., Pagel 1997,\npp. 218 ff.), without employing any deeper nucleosynthetic or\nphysical prescriptions. Such more detailed modeling is left for\nfuture work.\nIn that spirit, Figure 12 shows the predicted MDFs for two\nsimple models of chemical evolution. To start with, we obtained\na best-fit representation of a modified simple closed-box model\nallowing for outflows, which is exclusively parameterized by the\neffective yield peA. Basically, this value is proportional to the true\nnucleosynthetic yield and takes into account effects of the loss of\nmetals. Consequently, the mean metallicity is reduced to below\nthe true yield by the same factor, which relates the outflows and\nthe actual SF rate. A low yield of 0.06 Z\u0002 is well able to re-\nproduce the metal-poor mean location of the peak of the MDF,\nwhen compared to the solar neighborhood, which peaks at around\n\u00010.2 dex (Nordstro\u00a8m et al. 2004 and references therein). How-\never, this prediction tends to overestimate the number of stars\nbelow \u00011.8 dex (note that the most metal-poor object in our\nsample was excluded from the fit), leading to the well-known\nG dwarf problem. We note that a comparison of these models,\nwhich are based on predictions for long-lived stars, to our ob-\nservations of K giants with predominantly negligible lifetimes\nis still valid, since the simple model of chemical evolution does\nqualitatively predict an excess of metal-poor K giants under the\nassumptions of a standard initial mass function and loss of metals\nfrom the galaxy (Koch et al. 2007). Moreover, it has been shown\nthat there is no noticeable difference between the K giant MDF in\nthe solar neighborhood (McWilliam 1990) and the local G dwarf\nMDF from, e.g., Nordstro\u00a8m et al. (2004). Hence, we carry onwith\nthe long-standing practice of applying the G dwarf predictions to\nK giant MDFs as tracers of low-mass stars.\nAfter allowing for an admixture of a nonzero initial metallicity\n(prompt initial enrichment [PIE]), the overprediction toward the\nmetal-poor tail is reduced and it turns out that a preenrichment of\nZ0 \u00bc 0:013 Z\u0002 yields a remarkably good representation of the\noverall shape of the observedMDF.We refer the interested reader\nto Koch et al. (2006, 2007) for a discussion of these standard\nmodels.\n9. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have obtained radial velocity measurements for 120 red\ngiants in the Leo I dSph. These data not only increase existing\npublished samples by more than a factor of 3 but also extend in\nradial distance beyond previous studies of the central regions of\nthe galaxy (M98).\nAlthough the weak velocity gradient that our data exhibit co-\nincides with an apparent rotation about the observedmajor axis of\nLeo I, the associated amplitude has been shown to be insignificant.\nMoreover, we do not detect any trend of mean radial velocitywith\nmajor-axis distance, and in particular we do not find any evidence\nof an asymmetric velocity distribution toward the outer regions, in\nFig. 14.\u2014CaT metallicities of our radial velocity members vs. their elliptical radius (top). Nominal core and tidal radii are also denoted by vertical lines. The bottom left\nshows the cumulative number distribution vs. radius of the more metal-rich component (solid line) and the more metal-poor population (dotted line). These are practically\nindistinguishable. MDFs at different radii are displayed in the bottom right panel. These density distributions were convolved by individual measurement errors. No apparent\ntrend of [Fe\/H] with radius is discerned.\nKOCH ET AL.258 Vol. 657\nthe sense that the eastern (western) halves of the galaxy would\npreferentially exhibit an excess of low-velocity (high-velocity)\noutliers outside the formal tidal boundary. Supplemented by\nLeo I\u2019s high radial velocity, which we confirmed, and its large\ndistance from the MW, Leo I most likely represents an isolated\nsystem, which is currently not affected by Galactic tides, at least\nfrom a kinematical point of view. This is also consistent with\nour detection of nine radial velocity members outside the nominal\n\u2018\u2018tidal\u2019\u2019 radius and implies that the difficulty of the King model\nfunctional fit to surface brightness data at some (outer) radius is\nnot necessarily dynamical evidence of a physical effect. Tidal\nradii for dSphs, as typically derived from photometry, are labels\nand are not proven to be related in any way to gravitational\ntides. The results of S06 indicate that Leo I\u2019s surface brightness\nprofile exhibits multiple breaks at large radii, where it deviates\nfrom common King models, while further recent photometric\nanalyses do not provide any such clear evidence of photometric\ncomplexity above the noise level (Smolc\u02c7ic\u00b4 et al. 2006). Still the\ndetection of dSphs\u2019 stellar populations far out beyond the limiting\nradius, as in the case of Carina (Mun\u02dcoz et al. 2006b), suggests that\nsome dSphs may in fact be perturbed systems, at least in their\noutermost regions. Clearly this has implications for estimates of\nthe darkmatter content of dSphs at the largest radii, as tidal effects\nmay inflate the projected dispersion in these regions.\nOur derived projected radial velocity dispersion profile is flat\nout to the nominal tidal radius, a result that is turning out to be a\nvery common feature among the dSphs of the MW system, being\nestablished in numerous studies of large radial velocity samples\nout to and even beyond their nominal tidal radii (Mateo 1997;\nKleyna et al. 2001, 2003, 2004;xokas 2001, 2002;Wilkinson et al.\n2004, 2006a, 2006b; Mun\u02dcoz et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2006a;\nWestfall et al. 2006). Coupled with the overall highM\/L ratios and\nlack of unambiguous evidence for nonequilibrium effects, the\nprime explanation offlat dispersion profiles is that dSphs are dark\nmatter supported at all radii, although the N-body simulations of\nS06 indicate that also tides could reproduce such features in Leo I.\nNevertheless, at its large present galactocentric distance, tidal\ninfluences would be plausible only if Leo I\u2019s orbit were close to\nradial. However, our current data set does not allow us to constrain\nits proper motions and any information about its orbit will have to\nawait future accurate proper-motion measurements.\nIt turns out that the observed dispersion profiles are largely con-\nsistent with an isotropic velocity distribution, but nonnegligible\namounts of radial (tangential) anisotropy may be needed to ac-\ncount for the shape of the dispersion profile at the largest (smallest)\ndistances.\nAn apparent rise in the velocity dispersion profile at nearly the\ncore radius was demonstrated not to be a localized dynamical sub-\nstructure in the galaxy.By using simple prescriptions to describe the\nshape of the observed velocity dispersion profile, we obtain an esti-\nmate of the enclosedmasswithin the nominal tidal radius of 900 pc\nof\u00038 ; 107 M\u0002 under the assumption of velocity isotropy. Such\namass and the resultant highmass-to-light ratio of\u000324 (M\/L)\u0002 are\nhigher than previously derived values (M98; S06). From theirM\/L\nof \u00036Y13 (M\/L)\u0002,M98 concluded that Leo I contains a significant\ndark component. These estimates are in reassuringly good agree-\nmentwith the values derived from light profiles obtained fromhigh-\nquality photometric data under the assumption of an extended\nconstant dark matter halo density (Smolc\u02c7ic\u00b4 et al. 2006). Hence, our\nresults strengthen this view and are in concordance with an ex-\ntended dark matter distribution with a halo mass of a typical scale\n(\u00033 ; 107 M\u0002), which is shared by the other dSphs of the LG.\nBy adopting an NFW95 density profile for Leo I, we estimate\nits total virialmass within its dark matter halo to be\u00031 ; 109 M\u0002.\nThemasswithin the tidal radius is estimated to be\u00037:7 ; 107 M\u0002.\nThis does not change much under the assumption of a constant\ndensity core in Leo I, where the enclosed mass and best-fit an-\nisotropy are consistent with the values from a cusped profile.\nAlthough the density profile obtained using Jeans equations,\nunder the assumption of velocity isotropy, indicates a flat central\ncore, this scenario is not significantly preferred against the NFW95\ncase if one exclusively argues on the basis of the velocity dis-\npersion profile. In general, the shape of the observations seems\nto indicate that dark matter in fact dominates this dSph at large\nand small distances. We are aware that analysis only of a disper-\nsion profile \u0005(r) is not sufficient to derive a unique kinematical\ndistribution function of a stellar system. Unless more numerous\ndata sets and in particular the higher moments of the velocity dis-\ntribution are considered, there remains a degeneracy between\nanisotropy and density, leading to identical line-of-sight dis-\npersion profiles (e.g., Merrifield &Kent 1990; xokas &Mamon\n2003). While in general such an analysis requires more data than\nare currently available for Leo I, this will be pursued in future\npapers dealing with more detailed dynamical modeling (M. I.\nWilkinson et al. 2007, in preparation).\nWe derived metallicities for 58 of the member stars from the\nwell-established CaT calibration. In compliance with previous\nestimates thatwere drawn fromboth photometric and low-number\nspectroscopic analyses, we find a mildly metal-poor mean of\n\u00011.31 dex (CG97 scale) and a full spread in metallicity covering\n1 dex. This is noticeably smaller than the ranges found in dSphs\nwith extended or complex SFHs (Grebel 1997; Pont et al. 2004;\nTolstoy et al. 2004; Koch et al. 2006). This spread exceeds the\npredictions from CMDmodeling if one accounts for the narrow\nRGB and Leo I\u2019s existing intermediate-age population. Hence,\nthere may be also a large range in ages present in Leo I, as hinted\nat by the presence of also an old population (Held et al. 2000,\n2001) and the preliminary age determinations by Bosler et al.\n(2004).10 Practically all dSphs that contain significant intermediate-\nage populations do show a central concentration of their young\ncomponents (Stetson et al. 1998; Harbeck et al. 2001; Bellazzini\net al. 2005). Intriguingly, Leo I\u2019s prominently younger and pre-\nsumably metal-rich population does not exhibit this distinct pop-\nulation gradient. Neither its stellar populations (Held et al. 2000)\nnor the metallicities we derived here show any evidence of radial\ngradients. In this respect, Leo I is rather unusual among these\nsystems. This property may again point to a negligible role of\nexternal influences, such as localized accretion of material, in\nLeo I\u2019s evolution, allowing for good mixing of its gas. Since\ntides would affect this mixing, it is therefore possible that its\ncurrent large distance from theMWmay be representative of its\nwhole evolution and that it never approached the Galaxy very\nclosely. This view is consistent with the finding that the fraction\nof intermediate-age populations is closely related to the dSphs\u2019\ngalactocentric distance (e.g., Grebel et al. 2003 and references\ntherein). This behavior can be taken as indicative of an increased\ninfluence of (e.g., ram pressure) stripping close to the MW (van\nden Bergh 1994; Grebel 1997; Grebel et al. 2003) and will not\nhave affected Leo I to a major extent. We note, however, that S06\nargue that the presence of the various stellar populations in Leo I\nmay in fact be linked to much closer perigalactic passages, which\nfacilitated the onset of SF, a scenario that would then incorporate a\nnonnegligible role of tides in Leo I\u2019s evolution.\nWe identified one comparatively metal-poor star in our sample,\nwhich is unlikely to be a foreground contaminant. With its likely\n10 See http:\/\/www.ociw.edu\/ociw\/symposia\/series\/symposium4\/proceedings\n.html.\nSTELLAR KINEMATICS AND METALLICITIES IN LEO I 259No. 1, 2007\n[Fe\/H] of roughly \u00012.6 (CG97 scale), it lies 0.8 dex below the\nmetal-poor tail of our observed MDF. It has been suggested that\nthe explosion of only one massive pregalactic Population III star\nproduces a sufficient amount of energy to expel the entire gas from\nthe first (high z) cosmological minihalos (Bromm et al. 2003). If\nthe expelled gas falls back afterward, the subsequently forming\ngeneration of stars, which we would observe as the most metal-\npoor and the oldest stars in dSphs, should bear the chemical\nsignature of these Population III stars (e.g., Beasley et al. 2003;\nKawata et al. 2006). This makes metal-poor stars in dSph gal-\naxies the prime targets for searches of the signatures of the first\nstars. However, no star with a metallicity below roughly\u00013 dex\nhas been detected in a dSph so far (Fulbright et al. 2004; Sadakane\net al. 2004). The question of whether the lack of any such ex-\ntremely metal-poor objects in the current data is merely due to\nthe low number statistics of present-day observations, hence re-\nflecting an incomplete sampling, or whether such objects gener-\nally do not exist in dSphs remains unsolved. Thus, the presence of\nsuch a comparatively low metallicity object in our data provides\nan invaluable testing ground to study the early phases of general\ngalactic evolution.\nWe thankMike Irwin for providing the CASU photometry, Lee\nClewley for support with the GMOS pipeline, Rachel Johnson for\nassistance in preparing the observations, and Vernesa Smolc\u02c7ic\u00b4 for\nproviding us her photometric results before publication.
