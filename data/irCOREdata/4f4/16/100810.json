INTRODUCTION\nNarrow-gap semiconductors \u0001NGSs\u0002 have been exten-\nsively studied due to their importance for the development of\nlong wavelength optoelectronic devices and infrared detec-\ntors. InSb has been of particular interest, because of the re-\ncent development of extraordinary magnetoresistive\nsensors,\n1 high speed electronic transistors,2 and possible hy-\nbrid spintronic devices based on high mobility InSb\nepilayers.3 Moreover, a small electron effective mass as well\nas strong spin-orbit coupling, and hence a strong Rashba\neffect, make InSb a promising candidate for spintronic appli-\ncation.\nIt is essential for spintronics to be able to control spin\ndynamics with an external electric field.4 In bulk n-type\nsemiconductors, two spin relaxation processes are dominant.\nThey are described by the D\u2019yakonov-Perel\u20195 \u0001DP\u0002 and\nElliot-Yaffet6 \u0001EY\u0002 mechanisms. Only in the case of the DP\nprocess is it possible to alter the spin lifetime with an applied\nelectric field by modulating the strength of the spin-orbit\ncoupling through the Rashba effect. The efficiency of the DP\nmechanism is proportional to the electron mobility, whereas\nfor the EY mechanism it is inversely proportional. It has\nbeen theoretically predicted that for bulk III-V semiconduc-\ntors the EY process dominates only at very low temperature.\nAlthough the EY process is more effective for NGS, the\ntransition between the DP and EY processes for high mobil-\nity InSb has been estimated to occur at 5 K.7 The situation is\ndifferent in the case of low electron mobility. For low mo-\nbility InSb quantum wells \u0001QW\u0002 it has already been reported\nthat the crossover between the two processes could occur\neven at room temperature.8\nFrom a practical point of view, InSb epilayers are gen-\nerally grown on semi-insulating GaAs substrates. The lattice\nmismatch \u000114.6%\u0002 results in the formation of an interface\naccumulation layer with a large defect concentration, which\nis the main obstacle to the manufacturing of thin InSb films\nof high mobility. The electron mobility in this layer could be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than that in bulk mate-\nrial. Due to native surface defects, a low-barrier depletion\nregion is formed on the surface of the InSb films. It has been\nsuggested that the existence of an inversion layer at the sur-\nface would be preferable to form a contact with metallic\nmaterials without a significant resistance mismatch, and con-\nsequently, to increase the efficiency of spin injection from\nferromagnetic materials.9 Charge accumulation is particu-\nlarly strong on the surface of InAs \u0001Ref. 10\u0002 and\nHg1\u2212xCdxTe,11 but as pointed out in our previous publication\non InAs,9 the very short spin lifetime in this region is likely\nto be detrimental in lateral devices where current flows along\nthe surface. Consequently, we have explored the spin relax-\nation properties of InSb films of various thicknesses to de-\ntermine the optimum structure for spintronic applications.\nAlthough the density and mobility profiles are expected\nto be gradually varying, for simplicity InSb films grown on\nGaAs have been considered as consisting of three regions: a\nsurface depletion region, a low mobility interface, and a high\nmobility bulklike region. Because of the strong dependence\nof the spin relaxation processes on the mobility and carrier\nconcentration, the transport properties and spin dynamics are\ndifferent in these layers. For InAs films grown on GaAs sub-\nstrates it was found that even for a thick film \u00011 \u0001m\u0002, the\nmajority of the current \u000160%\u0002 flows through the surface ac-\ncumulation layer, which demonstrated a subpicosecond spin\nlifetime.9 It was pointed out in Ref. 9 that this fact means\nthat if InAs is to be useful for spintronic applications steps\nmust be taken to overcome the surface conduction. In con-\ntrast, InSb films have all the advantages of narrow-gap ma-a\u0002Electronic mail: k.litvinenko@surrey.ac.uk\nJOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS 101, 083105 \u00012007\u0002\n0021-8979\/2007\/101\u00028\u0001\/083105\/5\/$23.00 \u00a9 2007 American Institute of Physics101, 083105-1\nDownloaded 31 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

The improved two-step growth\nrecipe with the LT buffer has been developed in Imperial\nCollege in order to reduce the influence of the defects origi-\nnating at the interface of the InSb films.13 The samples were\nthen annealed at a high temperature \u0001HT\u0002. An additional in-\nvestigation was performed to optimize the temperature of the\nHT second growth step, which was found to be 380 \u00b0C.14 A\nremarkable improvement of the transport properties has been\nreported for these samples.14 For comparison, the spin relax-\nation of an undoped, 4 \u0001m thick InSb film \u0001sample me1655\u0002\nwas also investigated. The mobility and carrier concentration\nof this film were 6.37 m2\/V s \u00013 m2\/V s\u0002 and 1.4\n\u00021015 cm\u22123 \u00012.8\u00021015 cm\u22123\u0002 at 300 K \u000177 K\u0002, appropriate\nfor the phonon limited mobility in quasibulk InSb.15\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS\nIn order to obtain the mobility \u0001 and carrier concentra-\ntion n, Hall measurements were performed on 5 mm diam-\neter clover-leaf Van der Pauw patterns in the temperature\nrange from 77 to 300 K. A detailed investigation of the\ntransport properties of this set of high quality InSb films of\ndifferent thicknesses is presented elsewhere.13,14,16 It was\nfound that the transport properties of the films are well de-\nscribed by a two-channel conductivity model considering\nonly the interface and bulklike region.16 In order to decon-\nvolute the depth dependence of the mobility and carrier con-\ncentration from any pair of films in the set, it was assumed\nthat the properties of the thinner film and the region of the\nsame thickness of the thicker film are the same. Thus the\nproperties of the remaining top region of the thicker film can\nbe found differentially by means of the standard two-layer\nHall formulas.14 The differential mobility and carrier concen-\ntration of these layers of the InSb films at room temperature\nare presented in Table I. Note that the layers i=0, 1, 2, and 3\ndo not intentionally correspond to the interface, bulk, and\nsurface regions discussed above, they simply represent the\naverage carrier density and mobility over a specific region of\nthe film depth. However, Poisson-Schr\u00f6dinger modeling of\nthe band structure of these layers \u0004see the inset, Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0005\nshows that the interface accumulation layer thickness and\nsurface depletion depth \u0001for low-doped material\u0002 are about\n50 and 100 nm, respectively, so that to a good approximation\nthe interface accumulation region consists of the LT layer\n\u0001i=0\u0002 and first layer \u0001i=1\u0002, and the surface depletion region\nis a small fraction of the third layer \u0001i=3\u0002, the rest of which,\nalong with the second layer \u0001i=2\u0002, are in the bulklike intrin-\nsic region. The latter is not quite homogeneous and in fact\nshows a gradual improvement in properties with increasing\nthickness. The sheet conductivity of each layer is equal to the\nproduct \u0001nd, where d is the thickness of the channel, and\nthus the ratio of the current carried by each channel to the\ntotal current through the whole film can be estimated. As one\ncan see from Table I, in the thickest film \u00011 \u0001m\u0002 the interface\n\u0001sum of i=0 and i=1 layers\u0002 of the InSb film, which we have\nfound to have a short spin lifetime \u0001see below\u0002, carries not\nmore than 7.5% of the total current. Over 92% therefore\nflows through the bulklike material, which is much greater\nthan for the InAs films9 where for the same thickness 10% of\nthe current flows through the interface region and 60% flows\nin the surface accumulation layer. Clearly in thinner films the\nproportion of current carried in the accumulation layer\u0001s\u0002 is\ngreater, and this accounts for the change in relative strengths\nof the observed lifetimes in the samples of different thick-\nnesses.\nThe temperature dependencies of the derived mobility of\neach conducting channel are shown in Fig. 1. The tempera-\nture at which the predicted crossover between EY and DP\nprocesses occurs for the nondegenerate case is also shown in\nthis figure. For the degenerate case, which is relevant only\nfor the 0.1 and 0.3 \u0001m films, the mobility of all constituent\nlayers is in the EY dominated regime over the whole tem-\nperature range. Although the concentration of defects was\nsignificantly reduced by the improved growth recipe for dis-\ntances greater than 100 nm from the LT buffer layer,14 the\nelectron mobility is too small to remove EY spin flip scatter-\ning and to make such thin films suitable for spintronic appli-\nTABLE I.

DP domination is only\nachieved at distances further than 300 nm from the interface.\nA circularly polarized pump-probe experiment was per-\nformed to study the spin dynamics. The induced transmission\nchange of the probe beam was measured as a function of the\ntime delay between pump and probe pulses having the same\ncircular polarizations \u0001SCPs\u0002 and opposite circular polariza-\ntions \u0001OCPs\u0002. The optical polarization \u0001SCP\u2212OCP\u0002 \/ \u0001SCP\n+OCP\u0002 is proportional to the spin polarization in the\nsample.17 The light source was a difference frequency gen-\nerator, which mixes the signal and the idler beams of an\noptical parametric amplifier, itself pumped by an amplified\nTi:sapphire oscillator. The time resolution of the experiments\nwas about 200 fs. A ZnSe photoelastic modulator was used\nto modulate the polarization of the pump beam. The detailed\ndescription of the experimental technique is given\nelsewhere.8 The energy of the photons was chosen to be\nclose to the band gap in order to increase the penetration, so\nthat we assume a uniform excitation through the thickness of\nthe films.\nAs mentioned above, the mobility and carrier concentra-\ntion gradually change with the depth of the films; neverthe-\nless the evolution of the spin population, shown in Fig. 2 for\nall samples, can be well described by either a single or dual\nexponential decay.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nAs one can see from Fig. 2, the 0.1 \u0001m film exhibits a\nsingle exponential spin decay for the whole temperature\nrange, whereas the thicker films are found to have two expo-\nnential decays. The short component of the spin lifetimes has\na similar value and temperature dependence for all samples\nand thus originate from the layers in common, i.e., the inter-\nface accumulation region. The intermediate thickness film\n\u00010.3 \u0001m\u0002 exhibits two exponential decays, and the long com-\nponent originates from layer i=2, i.e., the bulklike material.\nAt 300 K the long lifetime contribution of layer i=3 in the\nthickest \u00011 \u0001m\u0002 sample is similar to that of i=2. However, at\n77 K there is a clear difference in the long lifetime compo-\nnents of the 0.3 and 1 \u0001m films, and there is some evidence\nof the i=2 layer decay at short delay times in the signal from\nthe 1 \u0001m sample. The temperature dependencies of the spin\nlifetime of the 0.1 \u0001m film as well as the long components\nof the spin lifetime of the other two samples are shown in\nFigs. 3\u0001a\u0002\u20133\u0001c\u0002. The spin lifetime temperature dependence of\nthe 4 \u0001m, near-bulk InSb, also shown in Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002, demon-\nstrates that the top layer of the 1 \u0001m film exhibits similar\nproperties.\nFIG. 2.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http:\/\/jap.aip.org\/jap\/copyright.jsp\nThe mobility and carrier concentration of layers i=1\u20133\nwere used to calculate the spin lifetimes using degenerate\nand nondegenerate approximations. As expected from the\nmobility analyses, the spin lifetimes for 0.1 and 0.3 \u0001m films\nare well described by the EY relaxation mechanism \u0001see\nFigs. 3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002\u0002. The DP process predicts a spin lifetime\ntwo orders of magnitude larger for these samples. For the\n1 \u0001m film the DP process dominates at room temperature,\nand the EY at low temperatures.\nThe DP spin relaxation rate in bulk materials is given\nby9\n1\n\u0003s\n\u0001DP\u0002 \u0006 Q\u00042\n\u0001Ek\u00023\n\u00052EG\n\u0003p, \u00011\u0002\nwhere Ek is the electron kinetic energy, \u0003p is momentum\nrelaxation time, \u0004= \u00014\u0006 \/\u00073\u2212\u0006\u0002\u0001mc \/m0\u0002, \u0006=\u0007 \/ \u0001\u0007+EG\u0002, \u0007 is\nthe spin-orbit splitting of valence band, mc \/m0 is the electron\neffective mass in units of the free mass, EG is the fundamen-\ntal energy gap, and Q is a dimensionless constant.\nThe EY spin relaxation rate is described by9\n1\n\u0003s\n\u0001EY\u0002 \u0006 A\b\n2\b EkEG\t\n2 1\n\u0003p\n, \u00012\u0002\nwhere \b=\u0006\u00011\u2212\u0006 \/2\u0002 \/ \u00011\u2212\u0006 \/3\u0002 and A is a dimensionless con-\nstant, the value of which depends on the orbital scattering\nmechanism.7 In the limit of degenerate statistics the typical\nelectron kinetic energy Ek is given by EF \u0001the Fermi energy\u0002\nand in the opposite limit of nondegenerate statistics, it is kBT.\nFor the top layer of the 0.1 \u0001m \u00010.3 \u0001m\u0002 film the Fermi\nenergy is approximately 26 meV \u000122 meV\u0002 at 77 K, but\ndrops down to a few meV at room temperature. Therefore the\ntransition from degenerate to nondegenerate statistics is\nwithin this temperature range. Both degenerate and nonde-\ngenerate cases are presented in Figs. 3\u0001a\u0002 and 3\u0001b\u0002. In order\nto obtain the spin lifetime in the intermediate regime, the\naverage \nEk\nm\u000b is used to calculate the spin lifetime governed\nby both the DP \u0001m=3\u0002 and EY \u0001m=2\u0002 processes,9\n\n\u0001Ek\u0002m\u000b =\n\f \u0001Ek\u0002mf\u0001Ek\u0002\t\u0001Ek\u0002dEk\n\f f\u0001Ek\u0002\t\u0001Ek\u0002dEk\n, \u00013\u0002\nwhere f\u0001E\u0002 is the Fermi function, and \t is the density of\nstates. The result of this calculation is shown in Fig. 3 by\nsolid lines. Only the nondegenerate case is shown for the\n1 \u0001m film. The values of A \u0004Eq. \u00011\u0002\u0005 and Q \u0004Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0005 were\nused as the only fitting parameters and were found to be A\n=18 for the 0.1 \u0001m film \u0004Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0005, A=9.5 for the 0.3 \u0001m\nfilm \u0004Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002\u0005, and A=9.5 and Q=1.5 for the 1 \u0001m film\n\u0004Fig. 3\u0001c\u0002\u0005.\nIn order to estimate the spin lifetime of the low mobility,\nhigh carrier concentration LT buffer layer i=0 the degenerate\nEY relaxation mechanism was used, as shown in Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002 by\nthe dashed-dotted line. In spite of such a short spin lifetime,\nthe LT buffer layer carries only 0.5% of the total current and\ntherefore is not expected to affect the transport and spin\nproperties of the films.\nIt should be mentioned that the spin lifetime in intrinsic\nbulk InSb under high intensity laser excitation, which we\nhave previously reported to be 12 ps at room temperature,18\nis three times larger than the spin lifetime presented in Fig.\n3\u0001c\u0002 for the sample me1655 under weak excitation. In Ref.\n18 a free electron laser for infrared experiments \u0001FELIX\u0002\nwas used to create the spin population. The peak energy of\nFELIX was about 1 \u0001J. Such intense laser pulses generated a\nsignificant photohole density, which more than doubled the\nspin lifetime.9 The peak energy of the laser pulses used in the\nexperiment presented here was 10 nJ. The density of photo-\nholes generated by such pulses is negligibly small in com-\nparison with the FELIX experiment, and the measured spin\nlifetime is therefore the true electron spin DP lifetime, which\nwas estimated in Ref. 18 to be about 6 ps or less. This value\nagrees very well with the 4 ps room temperature spin life-\ntime obtained in the present work and proves that with low\nenergy laser pulses the real electron spin lifetime may be\nmeasured without the influence of photoholes.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nTo summarize, we have measured the temperature de-\npendence of the spin relaxation time in the range from\n77 to 300 K for undoped InSb films of different thicknesses\nbetween 0.1 and 1 \u0001m. The spin relaxation has several com-\nponents, which corresponds very well with the model of in-\nhomogeneous, layered conductivity. The spin lifetime in the\ninterface accumulation layer was shown to be the subpico-\nsecond value. Fortunately, its influence on the properties of\nthe whole InSb film should not be significant, because the LT\nlayer carries less than 1% of the total current in thick films.\nThe rest of the accumulation layer, which was found to have\na spin lifetime only a few times shorter than that in the bulk-\nlike region, carries less than 7% of the total current and\ntherefore will not considerably affect the properties of thick\nInSb films either. It was shown that the DP spin relaxation\nmechanism dominates in high mobility regions at room tem-\nperature, whereas the EY process dominates in low mobility\nregions over the whole temperature range and even in the\nhigh mobility regions at low temperature. The influence of\nthe surface depletion layer was not detected in either the\ntransport or spin properties of the films under investigation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe EPSRC is acknowledged for financial support under\nGrant No. EP\/C511999\/1.\n1S.
