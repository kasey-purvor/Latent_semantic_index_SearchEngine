However, it remains unclear whether \nboth soil particles and FIOs are mobilised by discharge independently, or whether soil \nparticles act as vehicles for FIO transport (Kay et al., 2007; Jamieson et al., 2005; Tyrell and \nQuinton, 2003).  There has been much speculation that FIOs may associate with soil particles \n(e.g. Oliver et al., 2005b; Tyrell and Quinton, 2003; Nagels et al., 2002), and in contrast to \nchemical agricultural contaminants, there is a limited availability of such sorption \nmeasurements for FIOs (Kay et al., 2007; McGechan and Vinten, 2003). The dynamics of \nmicrobial association with soil particles are likely to be complex (Ling et al., 2002) and \ninfluenced by a range of factors including, for example, cell motility (McCaulou et al., 1995), \n   3\ncell type (Characklis et al., 2005), electrostatic attraction (Marshall, 1975), cell-surface \nhydrophobicity (Strenstrom, 1989), the presence of extracellular polysaccharides (Lunsdorf et \nal., 2000; Costerton et al., 1978), the presence of manure (Guber et al., 2005; Kuczynska et \nal., 2005) and the ionic environment within the soil \/ water mix and interface (Gannon et al., \n1991).  \n \nA previous field experiment provided the rationale for this investigation; the patterns of \nemergence of E. coli and turbidity within a flow hydrograph followed a similar but delayed \nprofile relative to one another (Oliver et al., 2005a, p. 924). Thus, the peaks for turbidity, flow \nand E. coli concentration were not identical, but occurred in respective order as a function of \nincreasing time. The results suggested that E. coli may have been associated with \nhydrologically energised soil particles of a particular size fraction. This study was therefore \ndesigned to elucidate the attachment preference of E. coli with different particle size fractions.  \nThe aim of this study was to determine whether E. coli would 1) associate with soil particles, \nand if so, 2) would cells preferentially associate with a particular soil size fraction. It was \nhypothesised that E. coli would preferentially associate with small particle fractions because \nof their abundance and increased available surface area for attachment to occur.  \n \n2 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n2.1 Bacterial strain and culturing \nAn E. coli strain originally isolated from faeces collected from cattle at the Institute of \nGrassland and Environmental Research (IGER), North Wyke, was used in this study. An \novernight culture of E. coli in nutrient broth (Oxoid) was grown at 37oC and harvested by \ncentrifugation at 2900 g for 30 minutes using a MSE centaur 2 centrifuge. The pelleted cells \nwere re-suspended in sterile water and washed twice by centrifugation at 2900 g for 30 \nminutes then re-suspended once more in sterile water. The culture was then maintained at \n20oC overnight prior to addition to soil mixes to ensure that any excess nutrients were utilized \nby the bacteria. \n   4\n \n2.2 Soil \nClay loam soil of the Hallsworth Series (UK Soil Survey; Harrod, 1981), a Typic Haplaquept \n(USDA Soil Conservation Service, 1975) was collected from ungrazed pasture (UK National \nGrid Reference (NGR): SX 650 995). \n \n2.3 The experimental approach \nA two-step batch sorption experiment was performed as illustrated in Figure 1. Step one was \nthe crux of the experiment: briefly, treatments of soil and water and bacterial cell mixes were \nshaken under controlled laboratory experimental conditions to facilitate cellular contact with \nsoil particles in a dynamic aquatic environment. Step two was a timed procedure governed by \nStoke\u2019s law: soil particles were fractionated into defined size classes and the associated E. \ncoli enumerated by standard microbiological plate counts. All treatments were performed in \ntriplicate. \n \n2.3.1 Step one: Experimental stage \nA mass of 1 g (dry weight) of fresh sieved (< 2 mm) soil was added, in triplicate, to sterile \nsample bottles of 25 ml volume. To facilitate the mixing of soil with water and the addition of \ncells, the sample bottles were filled with 10 ml of water collected from the River Taw at \nPecketsford Bridge (National Grid reference (NGR) SX 650 950), adjacent to the plot where \nsoil was collected, and then shaken overnight. River water was used because there was no \ndrainage from grassland plots at the time of collection. River water was therefore the most \nappropriate diluent in this context. The use of an ionic dispersant may have had a chemical \/ \nionic impact on potential cell attachment dynamics to soil particles, and was considered \ninappropriate for this experiment. No background counts of E. coli were detected in the soil \nand river water samples used in this study. \n \n   5\nThe soil suspensions were then inoculated with approximately 107 E. coli ml-1 that had been \nprepared as described earlier. The bottles were sealed and shaken end on end at a constant 60 \nrev min-1 at 20oC for three hours (c.f. Ling et al., 2002; Gannon et al., 1991). \n \n2.3.2 Step two: Sedimentation stage \nThe soil-cell-water suspensions from step one were transferred to graduated glass measuring \ncylinders and diluted to 50 ml with river water. The purpose of the dilution was to facilitate \nthe fractionation of the different sized particles based on their different gravity sedimentation \nrates. \n     \nAll sedimentations were conducted at a constant temperature of 20oC and all samples were \nremoved from solutions at a sampling depth of 8 mm (Gannon et al., 1991) at times derived \nfrom Stoke\u2019s law equation. Glass measuring cylinders were sealed with parafilm and inverted \nfive times, end on end, to ensure thorough mixing. The cylinders were then left to allow \nparticle sedimentation. The concentration at time t = 0 was calculated by dividing the initial \ninoculum concentration by the successive dilutions associated with steps one and two (on the \nassumption that bacterial die-off was zero during step one). Using a pipette, samples were \nthen removed from a succession of sedimentation tubes arranged in a time series according to \ncalculated timings (removal of sample = Tn). This is a method which is known to produce \nprecise and reproducible results (Arriaga et al., 2006).  \n \nSedimentation samples were serially diluted in sterile water and spread-plated onto \nMacConkey agar and incubated for 24 hr at 37oC prior to enumeration of E. coli colony \nforming units (CFU). The difference in CFUs recorded between sample T0 and sample Tn was \nattributed to the retention and subsequent sedimentation of E. coli. Changes in E. coli \npopulation size due to die-off and \/ or regrowth were insignificant in the soil-water solution \nover the short sedimentation time period (38 minutes) (Oliver, unpublished data). One-way \n   6\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) on log transformed counts was used to test for differences \nbetween treatments.  \n \n2.4 Determination of the attachment of E. coli cells to soil particles \nUsing the principles embodied in Stoke\u2019s law, the specific surface area of each particle size \nfraction was calculated (Table 1) to approximate the number of E. coli cells attached per unit \nsurface area available of each size fraction. This was done to determine if E. coli showed any \npreference to a particular soil size fraction. The following steps were taken: \n \n1. Particle density; All particles were assumed to be spherical and to have the same density \n(2.6 g cm-3). These are underlying assumptions of Stoke\u2019s law upon which these experiments \nwere based.  \n2. Particle volume calculation; The radius of particles was assumed to be the mid-point radius \nof the fraction size range.  \n3. Number of particles in a 1 ml sample of each size fraction; The total mass of the fraction in \n1 ml was divided by the product of a single particle\u2019s density and volume.  \n4. Size range; An upper limit of 200 \u00b5m was assigned to the fraction >31 \u00b5m. Particle size \ndata of Harrod (1981) showed that, for the Hallsworth soil type, fine sand (60-200 \u00b5m) \nrepresented the greatest proportion of mass within the sand classification. Because this \nfraction used in this experiment also incorporated silt particles (down to 31 \u00b5m diameter), it \nwas considered acceptable that the mean particle size should be weighted more towards \nparticles in the smaller size fraction.  \n5. Number of cells per particle; The number of soil-associated E. coli per ml was divided by \nthe number of particles in 1 ml of sample.  \n6. Number of cells associated with 1 mm2 of surface area for each size fraction; The number \nof soil-associated E. coli per ml was divided by the total surface area occupied by that size \nfraction in 1 ml of sample. \n \n   7\n3 RESULTS \nThe purpose of this study was to assess whether E. coli would associate with soil particles and \nfurthermore, would cells preferentially attach to a particular soil particle size fraction. The \ntotal proportion of cells demonstrating an affinity for soil particles \u22652 \u00b5m was 35% of the \ninitial inoculum. A cumulative increase in the proportion of cells associating with the solid \nfraction was recorded with the removal of each successively smaller size fraction during the \nsedimentation stage. Figure 2 (white bars) shows the proportion of E. coli retained by the \ndifferent size fractions for 1 g of Hallsworth soil series added to water at a 1:10 ratio. A \nsignificantly higher (P \u2264 0.001) proportion (65%) of the cells were found to be in the \u22642 \u00b5m \nor freely suspended size range, relative to all other size fractions. However, discriminating \nwhether cells were attached to particles \u22642 \u00b5m or freely suspended was not possible. For the \n\u226531 \u00b5m, 30-16 \u00b5m, 15-4 \u00b5m and 3-2 \u00b5m size fractions the percentage of inoculum cells \nretained was 2, 12, 14 and 7% respectively. No significant difference existed between the \nproportion of cells retained by the fractions 30-16, 15-4 or 3-2 \u00b5m (P > 0.05). The proportion \nof cells retained by the \u226531 \u00b5m fraction was significantly smaller (P \u2264 0.05) than the fractions \n30-16 \u00b5m and 15-4 \u00b5m. \n \nTable 1 summarises the volume, surface area, mass and number of particles associated with \neach size fraction. The data in Table 1 enabled the theoretical number of cells associating per \nparticle of each size fraction to be calculated and thus the number of cells associated with 1 \nmm2 of surface area for each size fraction could be derived. \n \nNormalised data, showing the number of cells retained per mm2 of surface area for each size \nfraction is presented in Figure 2 (black bars) and this highlights that there was a significantly \n(P \u2264 0.001) different number of cells associated with a unit surface area of different size \nfractions. The 30-16 \u00b5m fraction was found to support a significantly higher (P \u2264 0.001) \nconcentration of cells per unit area than all other size fractions > 2 \u00b5m, including the more \nabundant 15-4 \u00b5m fraction. For soil particles > 2 \u00b5m, E. coli showed at least 3.9 times more \n   8\npreference to associate with the 30-16 \u00b5m than any other fraction. There is a considerable \nshift in importance of the 30-16 \u00b5m fraction when data is normalised for surface area. In \naddition it was confirmed that a greater (P \u2264 0.05) concentration of cells associated with 1 \nmm2 surface area belonging to the 15-4 \u00b5m and \u226531 \u00b5m fraction than the 3-2 \u00b5m size \nfractions. \n \n4 DISCUSSION \nThe main finding of this study was that while 65% of E. coli associated with the <2 \u00b5m \nfraction, those cells associating with the >2 \u00b5m fraction showed preferential attachment (cells \nper unit area) to soil particles in the size range 30-16 \u00b5m. The results of this study also \nconfirm our initial view that previous results had indicated that E. coli attached to soil \nparticles, and that these were mobilised by hydrological events. This has significant \nimplications for the interpretation of bacterial attachment to different particles and the \nhydrological movement of cells in soils of different composition. The nature of association of \nFIOs and sediment have not been fully characterised (Jamieson et al., 2005) and very few \nstudies have investigated the partition of FIOs to different sedimentary fractions (Kay et al., \n2007). Our results suggest that the total proportion of cells with an affinity for soil particles \n\u22652 \u00b5m was 35% of the initial inoculum. This complements the finding of Characklis et al. \n(2005) who found that 20-35% of E. coli were associated with settleable particles in \nstormwater, estimated using a centrifugation technique. We do not consider that growth and \nre-growth of E. coli was a significant factor in this study due to the largely sub-optimal \ntemperature and nutrient status required for E. coli replication. \n \nThe study identified that, under the reported experimental conditions, in a soil-water solution \nthere was preferential attachment of E. coli to those particles in the size range 30-16 \u00b5m \n(normalised black bar data; Figure 2). Gauging the proportion of E. coli that may attach to soil \nparticles of different sizes is an important first step in elucidating the potential efficacy of \n   9\nmitigation measures, such as vegetated filter strips, for protecting watercourses from direct \nwash off of faecal bacteria from pasture (Oliver et al., 2007). \n \nThe particle fraction \u22642 \u00b5m, which included freely suspended cells, accounted for the \nmajority of the inoculated E. coli population in this study, however attempts to further assess \nthe role of smaller clay particles were inconclusive because it was not known whether the \nincreased association of E. coli with particles \u22650.5 \u00b5m to 2 \u00b5m was a function of increased \nexposure time during the sedimentation or actual preferential attachment to clay (Oliver, \nunpublished data). Furthermore, the wider significance of E. coli attachment to soil particles \nof an equal size or smaller than the diameter of an E. coli bacterial cell is unclear in the \ncontext of hydrological mobilisation dynamics. It is possible that cells attaching to soil \nparticles of a similar and smaller diameter will be mobilised together with unattached cells in \nwater flux through the soil, and that those cells that can be readily identified as attaching to \nlarger soil particles may be of importance in assessing the likelihood of E. coli persistence in \nsoils or vegetated filter strips (Fiener and Auerswald, 2003). Others investigating the \ntransported state of E. coli in overland flow from silt loam plots have suggested that the \nbacteria were predominantly associated with particles less than 20 \u00b5m in diameter as opposed \nto larger soil particles (Muirhead et al., 2006). \n \nOf the bacterial cells attached to soil particles, the greatest proportion of soil-associated  E. \ncoli was found in the size fraction 15-4 \u00b5m (White bars, Fig. 2). Other studies, examining \nstorm flow sediments from rivers, have reported that over 90% of faecal coliforms are \nassociated with particles in the range of 0.45 to 10 \u00b5m (Auer and Niehaus, 1993). Schillinger \nand Gannon (1985) were only able to determine cell association with particles \u22655 \u00b5m in urban \nstormwater for similar practical reasons as described in the research reported here: they \nconcluded that approximately 16% of faecal coliforms were associated with particles in \nexcess of 5 \u00b5m. In contrast, Borst and Selvakumar (2003) observed no correlation between \nfaecal coliform or faecal streptococcus concentrations and mean particle size. The few \n   10\npreviously reported results are highly variable and this may point to the need to evaluate \nresults on a case-by-case basis, with reference to the soil textural make-up where applicable. \n \nDespite cells being more abundant in the 15-4 \u00b5m fraction, it was the 30-16 \u00b5m fraction of \nsoil particles that accommodated the highest concentration of cells per unit area. Much of the \nliterature does not present the data in this format, however, Palmateer et al. (1993) did \nnormalise their data and observed that suspended sediments discharged from an agricultural \ndrain in summer tended to be highly colonized with faecal bacteria at a concentration of 6.5 x \n105 bacteria per mm2 of particulate surface area. Palmateer et al. (1993) observed a significant \nchange in cell numbers per unit surface area in the autumn when particulates in the \nheadwaters of the agricultural drain were colonized with 450 bacteria per mm2 surface area; \nthis is of similar magnitude to the number of E. coli associated with two of the size fractions \ninvestigated in this study.  \n \nPrevious research has reported that as much as 99.2% of E. coli can be adsorbed to soil \nparticles \u2265 1 \u00b5m in a clay loam (Ling et al., 2002). It was suggested that the clay content of \nthe soil strongly affected adsorption of E. coli. Clay particles have also been reported as being \ninfluential on the adsorption of agricultural contaminants such as, for example, phosphates \n(Magesan et al., 2003). As the \u22642 \u00b5m fraction could not be investigated in this study, it may \nbe that a significant proportion of cells were associated with the 1-2 \u00b5m clay fraction of \nRowden soil and this would explain the deficit between the results in this study and that of \nLing et al. (2002). Alternatively, differences may be attributed to the presence of different \ntypes of clay minerals that affect sorption, the soil:solution ratio used, cell exposure time to \nsoil and mixing speed of soil-cell solutions. Differences in attachment of laboratory and \nenvironmental isolates to soil particles have also been found. Using a New Zealand silt loam \nin an experimental static system, 24% of an introduced laboratory E. coli strain was found to \nattach to soil particles, compared to 81% of an environmental strain following 30 minutes \ncontact time between cells and soil (Muirhead et al., 2006).  \n   11\n \nIn conclusion, turbid runoff is likely to be comprised of a mixture of both freely suspended \nand particle-associated E. coli. We report that E. coli preferentially associates with different \nsoil particle size fractions in varying proportions. This may allow for a differential \nhydrological transfer of cells through soil depending on particle size and flow condition and \nsoil type. Implications of forming a cell-particle composite may also impact once E. coli are \ndelivered to vegetated filter strips and surface waters. This is because the significant \nproportion of E. coli that remains unattached or associated with particles \u22642 \u00b5m are likely to \n(i) avoid the removal mechanism of filter strips and (ii) remain buoyant in the water column \nand thus able to cause potential contamination problems further downstream. In contrast, the \nsmaller proportion of E. coli associated with larger soil particles are more likely to sediment \nout into the stream bed and delay possible impairment of water quality upon re-suspension.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nThe authors thank Dan Dhanoa for advice and guidance on statistical matters.
