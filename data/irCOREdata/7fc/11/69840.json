Experimental philosophers\nand public demonstrators in Augustan England\nSTEPHEN PUMFREY*\nThe growth of modern science has been accompanied by the growth of professionalization.\nWe can unquestionably speak of professional science since the nineteenth century,\nalthough historians dispute about where, when and how much. It is much more\nproblematic and anachronistic to do so of the late seventeenth century, despite the familiar\nview that the period saw the origin of modern experimental science. This paper explores\nthe broad implications of that problem.\nOne area of scientific activity, public science lecturing and demonstrating, certainly\nproduced its first professionals in the period 1660-1730. This was a period which Geoffrey\nHolmes called 'Augustan England', and which he found to be marked by the expansion\nof many of the professions.1 Swollen lower ranks of physicians, civil servants and teachers\ncrowded onto the ladder up to gentility, and even solicitors achieved respectability.\nAlongside these established types the professional scientist, such as the public lecturer, was\na novelty. Later, in the high Georgian era, a small army of men like Stephen Demainbray\nand Benjamin Martin made recognized if precarious livings from public experimentation,\nbut the first generation pioneers were entering new and risky territory. As Larry Stewart\nhas shown, 'the rise of public science' was a successful social and economic transformation\nof the highest significance in the history of science which was part of what has been called\nEngland's commercial revolution.2\nWe are accustomed to think of early, pioneering professionals like Robert Hooke,\nFrancis Hauksbee or Denis Papin as 'notable scientists'. That is how the Dictionary of\nScientific Biography describes Papin, and his entry is appropriately full and fulsome.3 It is\nthe aim of this paper to show that such judgements made no sense in Augustan society.\nIts professional experimenters knew more keenly than most the difficulties and obstacles\nwhich accompanied the 'making of middle class' and the concomitant reconfiguration of\nall English social relations. An attention to their difficulties, I think, casts important light\nupon the establishment of experimental learning, and continues the historiographical\nprocess of turning experiment from a triumphant given into a problem amenable to\n* Department of History, University of Lancaster, Lancaster LAI 4YG.\nThis paper was first presented at a joint meeting of the Science Museum and the British Society for the History\nof Science, 'Science Lecturing in the Eighteenth Century'.\n1 G. Holmes, Augustan England: Professions, State and Society, 1680-1730, London, 1982.\n2 Larry Stewart, The Rise of Public Science. Rhetoric, Technology and Natural Philosophy in Newtonian\nBritain, 1660-1750, Cambridge, 1992.\n3 DSB, s.v. 'Hauksbee, Francis'.\n132 Stephen Pumfrey\ngenuinely historical explanation. The problem is constituted from two obstacles which\nacted to prevent the work of professional experimenters from receiving intellectual\nrecognition.\nIn the first place, the early professional science lecturers and demonstrators were, by\ndefinition, employed to perform the service of experimenting. They generally performed\nfor and before men of high rank who, because of their financial independence and leisured\nlives, were unquestionably gentlemen of property, virtue and political and cultural\ninfluence. Paid employment betokened a much lower status, and professional experimenters\nwere very dependent upon collective or individual patronage. It is true that eighteenth-\ncentury Enlightenment critics of the old order were beginning to argue, with gradual\nsuccess, that a man's [sic] social status should be a reflection of his rational\naccomplishments rather than his inherited wealth and privilege. Indeed radical Whigs such\nas Addison and Steele promoted this new ideology just as public science was emerging,\nwhich they also promoted. Nevertheless, the liberal implications of that ideology were\nhotly contested, even by moderate Whigs, and few acted in accordance with it. The notion\nof a professional scientist was in the slow process of acquiring the status which it has today,\nbut it still had so little that the phrase is an anachronism. Consequently, it was not clear\nthat a paid experimenter could be a noble philosopher.\nSecondly, there was the nature of the service provided. Experimental philosophy\ninvolved not only head work but also hand work. The construction and use of air-pumps,\nfor example, demanded the manual skill and dirty, sweaty labour traditionally described\nas 'mechanick'. Although science lecturers might appear to differ little from minor lawyers\nor architects in offering professional expertise in return for a fee, the latter professions had\ncomfortably entered the ranks of the 'pseudo-gentry' by 1700 because even though the\nsource of their income was not property, it kept their hands clean. The better sort of\nartisan, such as an instrument maker, might have left 'the mechanick part of mankind'4\nto be redescribed as one of the' middling sort', but he was not genteel. In Augustan society,\nthen, not only the conditions but also the nature of his work was suspect. Thus, where we\nwould assume that a claimant of some discovery had performed the experiments, and had\nbeen paid to do so, Augustan social conventions would have made this doubly surprising.\nThose conventions fractured what for us is the unitary activity of the (professional)\nscientist, because they represented a different set of triangular relationships between\nlabour, reason and social status.\nThis paper presents and interprets evidence that public experimental work emerged in\na hierarchical society in which a person's 'reason' (qua the capacity to be accorded\nintellectual credibility) was strongly correlated with a social status which took little\naccount of intellectual merit. Since social status was negatively correlated with labour\n(specifically paid experimental labour), the triangle put into question whether an employed\nexperimenter or science lecturer could also be an experimental philosopher. There was a\ntension between the epistemological status of his productions, which looked more like\nexperimental philosophy than mechanical labour, and the social status of his position,\n4 For a discussion see Peter Earle, The Making of the English Middle Class: Business, Society and Family Life\nin London, 1660-1730, London, 1989, 3.\nWho did the work? 133\nwhich looked more like that of a mechanic servant than an experimental philosopher. It\nis worth noting, given that early modern discourses of status and rationality remained very\npatriarchal, that a woman science lecturer (had one existed) would have introduced further\nfractures and tensions.5\n' Who did the work ?' thus becomes a pertinent question to ask of Augustan experimental\nscience. It links to profound issues which concerned the upper orders and which came to\ndivide Whigs and Tories in the 'first age of party'. Was rapid change within the social\nhierarchy to be resisted or embraced ? What legitimate grounds divided an elite from the\npeople ? Who, amongst the emerging middle orders, should have a political voice, and who\nshould be admitted to the republic of letters? Was commercialization, most visibly of\nagriculture, which brought increased enclosure and wage labouring, benefiting the nation ?\nOr was 'the monied interest' destroying a traditional, harmonious social order based on\npatronage and deference? Were tradesmen now 'quality', and how should a proper\ngentleman behave towards them ?\nBy the early eighteenth century rapid change had produced many ideologists trying to\nmake sense of the new circumstances. The Tory Henry St John complained, on behalf of\n'the landed men', that 'a new interest has been created... [whose] men are become their\nmasters, who formerly would with joy have been their servants'. Conversely Daniel Defoe\ninsisted that trade was 'the staff on which both king and people lean, and which (if it\nshould sink) the whole fabric must fall'.6 Yet all but the most radical Whigs continued to\ninsist upon the proper observance of place despite (or because of) increased social mobility.\nDefoe was typical when he refused to endow political rights 'upon the inhabitants, but\nupon the Freeholders, the Freeholders are the proper owners of the Country'. And while\nTories were shocked even by such a limited commonwealth, they could agree with the\nWhig and Boyle Lecturer Samuel Clarke's insistence that order depended upon a man not\n' being either uneasy or discontented, that others are placed by providence in different and\nsuperior stations of the world; or so extremely and unreasonably solicitous to change his\nstate for the future, as thereby to neglect his present duty'.7 Faced with a society and its\npresiding ideologies in transition, many Augustans acted, wrote and thought con-\ntradictorily, in ways which extended to their assessment of experimental work.\nThe contradictions are very apparent in the political theory of John Locke, the self-styled\n'underlabourer' to Boyle, Sydenham and 'the incomparable Mr. Newton', Fellow of the\nRoyal Society, advocate of commerce and foremost Whig ideologist of the 'Glorious\nRevolution'. In his Second Treatise on Government Locke essayed a solution to the\nproblem of how to justify the overthrow of an established hierarchy (which most Tories\nsupported, however reluctantly) whilst safeguarding, against Whigs and others who sought\nmore radical change, the effective rule of an elite - albeit a more enterprising one. Since\nLocke based his political theory on concepts of the individual's inalienable liberty, and\n5 For a recent discussion of women and early modern science, see Patricia Phillips, The Scientific Lady: A\nSocial History of Women's Scientific Interests, 1520-1918, London, 1990. I am grateful for the editor's reminder\nthat gender compounded the fractures.\n6 See H. T. Dickinson, Liberty and Property. Political Ideology in Eighteenth-Century Britain, London, 1977,\n52, 86.\n7 Dickinson, op. cit. (6), 88-9, 87-8.\n134 Stephen Pwnfrey\nrights to property and citizenship through his labour, Locke's problem had a specific form:\nhow to prevent rights being claimed by the entire middle class, indeed by all labouring\nmen.8\nLocke's chief target was Robert Filmer's classical defence of the old order, Patriarcha,\nfirst published in 1653. Filmer's ideology had gained renewed popularity among Tories\nduring the political crises of the 1670s and 1680s. As R. Tully explains, a central 'classical\nbelief was 'that labour and property are incompatible. Those who labour can own no\nproperty and those who own property do not labour.' A related belief was that 'the master\nowns the labour and the products of his servants'.9 Against this, Locke asserted supposed\nnatural laws and rights, which reflected the interests of entrepreneurs and actively\nimproving landowners: '[E]very man has a Property in his own Person. This no Body has\nany Right to but himself. The Labour of his Body, and the Work of his Hands, we may\nsay, are properly his.'10 Superficially liberal, even socialist judgements of the modernity of\nhis conception of property11 have produced, for generations of commentators, the paradox\nof Locke's ensuing passage: 'Thus the Grass my Horse has bit; the Turfs my Servant has\ncut; and the Ore I have digg'd in any place where I have a right to them in common with\nothers, becomes my Property.'12\nLocke appears to have held both the 'modern' view that labour created absolute\nproperty rights and the classical view that 'the Turfs my Servant has cut...become my\nProperty'. Although recent commentators such as MacPherson, Tully, Tribe and Wood\ndiffer in their resolutions of the paradox, they agree that Locke was engaged in the far from\nmodern task of justifying new and rapidly evolving socio-economic relations.13 Their\nresolutions rightly focus upon reading Locke in the context of elite Augustan beliefs and\npractices concerning labour, property and master-servant relations. Such readings are of\ngreat importance in the resolution of the more specific paradoxical relations between\ngentlemen philosophers, such as Fellows of the Royal Society, and their experimental\nservants.\nFor leisured Fellows at meetings of the early Royal Society, these profound questions\ntook two circumscribed forms. First, was experimental work appropriate to their 'superior\n8 As Dickinson, op. cit. (6), 57, notes, 'only a minority of [Whigs] were committed to principles which might\nbe regarded as genuinely liberal... It is essential to remember that the Whigs shared many of the prejudices,\nassumptions and ultimate objectives of their Tory opponents.' Concerning Locke he comments that 'there is no\nreason to doubt that he accepted the dependance of the majority of the population on the aristocracy, gentry and\nclergy. Other Whig theorists were more explicit than Locke and they certainly restricted active political rights to\nmen of property' (p. 69). Despite the literally Whiggish readings of past political historians, Locke can no longer\nbe seen as a far-sighted advocate of modern, liberal democracy any more than the Royal Society should be seen\nas a proto-research institute.\n9 R.

The second concerned the public\nexperimenter\/science lecturer\/instrument maker whose performances were paid for from\ntheir subscriptions: was he a natural philosopher like them, an employed mechanic, or\nsome new, in-between creation of a commercializing society? In short, how was\nexperimental work appropriate to his station ?\nSuch questions have recently received attention from Steven Shapin and myself.14 In an\nearlier paper, I explored how these tensions operated upon Robert Hooke, the Royal\nSociety's Curator of Experiments, between the 1660s and 1680s. A major factor in Hooke's\ndifficulties was the very embryonic size, in both social span and absolute numbers, of the\ncareer ladder for the 'professional scientist' in Restoration England. Extending the study\ninto the eighteenth-century era of science lecturers such as J. T. Desaguliers, we encounter\na public sphere of commercial opportunities which Hooke would have envied, particularly\nthose outside the Royal Society's direct influence. The Society's classical vision of the\ngentleman virtuoso philosopher was infiltrated by the values of trade, the market place and\nthe 'monied interest' - values which Tories deplored and Whigs struggled with, but which\ncreated the community of commercial science and released the tensions between the roles\nof paid experimenter and experimental philosopher. The science lecturer, who came to\nbridge the gulf between experimental philosophy as work and as leisure or duty, is thus one\nof the more extraordinary and paradoxical products of the period.\nPAID EXPERIMENTERS AND THEIR HISTORICAL PARADOXES\nThe rise of the paid professional was rapid. No-one in England made a living from public\nexperimental science before Hooke became the Royal Society's 'Setled Curator of\nExperiments' in 1664. His differed from the traditional or private roles fulfilled by an\nacademic lecturer like Seth Ward, a court philosopher like John Dee, a client like Thomas\nHobbes or a private 'operator' like Richard Shortgrave. It was Curator Hooke's\nmisfortune that the seventeenth century offered few other, and certainly no more\nprestigious or remunerative outlets for his experimental talents.15 Yet by 1734 Desaguliers\ncould not 'help boasting of 11 or 12 Persons, who perform, Experimental courses at this\ntime in England and other parts of the world [because] I have had the honour of having\neight of them as my scholars'.16 In seventy years a community had developed which was\ntransforming the experimental study of nature from a gentlemanly pursuit into a publicly\nexchanged commodity.\nThe paradoxes which defeated Locke and his fellow Augustans have also misled\nhistorians of science. For one thing, we have evaluated Hooke as a leading experimental\nphilosopher where the Royal Society treated him as a servant.17 Secondly, commentators\n14 S. Shapin, 'Who was Robert Hooke?', in Robert Hooke: New Studies (ed. M. Hunter and S. Schaffer),\nWoodbridge, Suffolk, 1989, 257-83 and S. Pumfrey, 'Ideas above his station: a social study of Hooke's\ncuratorship of experiments', History of Science (1991), 29, 1-44. Shapin's A Social History of Truth: Gentility,\nCredibility and Scientific Knowledge in Seventeenth Century England, Chicago, 1994, is a broader study which\nwas published too recently for consideration in this paper.\n15 Hooke's disastrous period as Secretary to the Society showed that this was not a viable promotion.\n16 J. T. Desaguliers, A Course of Experimental Philosophy, volume I, London, 1734, p. cv.\n17 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), and Shapin, 'Hooke', op. cit. (14).\n136 Stephen Pumfrey\nhave wondered why the Society's most effective experimenters consistently came from the\n'wrong class'. These men, like the lecturing community they frequently belonged to, were\nnot gentlemen. As John Heilbron observed, 'Stephen Gray, a dyer by trade, fell below the\nsocial level at which the Society aimed.'18 Thirdly, why did some of the major\nexperimentalists of this period die in poverty and obscurity, with only historians to restore\ntheir credit? Where the DSB commemorates Denis Papin as a 'notable scientist', the Royal\nSociety deliberately cold-shouldered the destitute Huguenot as he made his last appeals for\nrecompense and employment.19 Fourthly, why were the Fellows of the Society most famous\nfor their experimental discoveries, like Hooke, Papin and Gray, far from being feted by\ncolleagues, frequently in dispute with them about the intellectual property rights to their\nwork.\nLastly, historians have found it disappointingly inconsistent that, despite the powerful\nand persistent experimentalist rhetoric generated within the Society first by an 'active\nnucleus' of founding Fellows and then by Newton and his allies, the early Society's\nexperimental programme was never securely established. While it may have been a 'golden\nage' for the reputation of individual Fellows and of the Philosophical Transactions,\nmeetings after 1666 left much to be desired. Thanks to the successive revisions of\nEspinasse, Hoppen and Hunter, we no longer think of the Society as the first research\ninstitute, with Hooke as a research director. But its fragile support for experimental\npractice has only recently been fully documented. Marie Boas Hall observes that\nexperiments stopped and discussion died, and that by 1727 'the proud motto of nullius in\nverba had little or no force when the Fellows no longer wished to see for themselves'.20\nEvery member was constantly exhorted, indeed bribed to remedy an ever-present dearth.\nYet from 1668, when a 20 shilling medal was available to any experimenter other than\nCurator Hooke, through numerous reforms later in the century, and still unmoved by the\n\u00a35 reward generated by Copley's bequest of 1709, the Fellows sat on their soft hands. One\nof Newton's final anxieties was the dishonour (blamed on Desaguliers) of Copley's name.21\nAll of these paradoxes are graphically illustrated by contrasting attitudes towards one\nof the Society's most active experimenters, and one of England's first science lecturers,\nFrancis Hauksbee senior (c. 1666-1713). The importance of Hauksbee's work with\nNewton on phosphorescence, electricity and optics to the enlargement of Newtonian\n18 J.

Following Sir Godfrey Copley's bequest, the Council decided to 'forever\ncause one experiment or more to be made before them...soon after the Anniversary meeting'. See the Royal\nSociety of London Journal Book for 20 June 1717, p. 239 (hereafter entries are cited in the form JB, 20\/6\/17, 239).\nDesaguliers was the first recipient in 1718.

Yet Richard Westfall concluded that 'Newton appears to have treated him not\nas an intellectual peer, but as a servant.'22 Hauksbee was not, of course Newton's\nintellectual peer but the German traveller Zaccharius von Uffenbach wanted in 1710 to visit\n'the natural-philosopher Hauksbee',23 not an operator. Outsiders like him would have\nbeen surprised to hear, as Council minutes typically recorded, that 'Mr Hauksbee was\nordered forty pounds for his last years waiting upon the Society and shewing and trying\ntheir experiments.'24 Even Fellows were slow to learn of his death in 1713 because the\nSociety did not mourn his passing. Instead, Council discussed outstanding payments for his\nservices, and:\nMrs Hawksbee was ordered twenty pounds for the service of her late husband for the time he\nmade experiments before the Society before his death she giving a receipt in full. Mr Hawksbee\nhis nephew was ordered five guineas for his services since his unkles [sic] death he giving a receipt\nin full.25\nThe official minutes doubtless accentuate Hauksbee's subordinate position, but the sum of\nthe evidence consistently points, as it does for Hooke, to a man considered first and\nforemost to be under direction, and lacking the independence that Augustans presumed of\ntheir natural philosophers. If we too presume that he was a natural philosopher (perhaps\nprecisely because he 'did the work') we miss the important discrepancy between the\nSociety's assessment, and that of foreigners like von Uffenbach. The latter knew a textual,\nvirtuous Hauksbee read out of experimental records in the Philosophical Transactions and\nin his Physico-Mechanical Experiments of 1709, and not a working, employed Hauksbee\ndeveloping experiments for the Royal Society and other paying publics.26\nThe point is vivid in Nicolas Desmarest's eloge of 1754, where Hauksbee is made to\nembody the finest qualities of the natural philosopher. It was written as part of d'Alembert\nand Bremond's campaign at the Academie des Sciences to defeat the Cartesian\nImpulsionnaires and their esprit de systeme and to advance the Newtonian Attractionnaires\nand the esprit systematique}1\nM. Hauksbee became known around 1704 as a natural philosopher with enormous skill in manual\noperations, and a scrupulous precision when discussing phenomena. He can be considered as the\nfirst person in London who laid the phenomena of natural philosophy before the gaze of a sober\n22 Richard S. Westfall, Never at Rest.

In his experiments we discover the first steps towards a systematic spirit...\nAnd that illustrious company [the Royal Society], convinced by the Tightness of his judgements\nand by his skill, entrusted him with the repetition on numerous important occasions of complex\nexperiments in order to remove doubts and to remedy uncertainties. He justified their\nchoice...and they admired his exact observations and the finesse of his touch as much as his\ninsight and his wisdom - the qualities which together make up the natural philosopher.28\nDesmarest also considered that, despite the dependance of English savants on Hauksbee's\napparatus, 'he did not abuse this trust by turning these machines into commercial objects,\nwhich would have been to cede control to the ignorant'. That, like much else was wishful\nthinking. Whilst it was true that Hauksbee became known to London's natural\nphilosophical community around 1704, he did so as Newton's choice of casual operator for\nthe Society and not as a natural philosopher.29 Desmarest appears to have gleaned his fact\nfrom the preface to Desaguliers' Course in Experimental Philosophy. Desaguliers' book\nitself offers yet another assessment,\nDr John Keill was the first who publickly taught Natural Philosophy by Experiments in a\nMathematicall Manner... in Oxford, about the year 1704 or 1705... There were indeed, about the\nsame time, Experiments shewn at London by the late Mr. Hauksbee... But as they were only\nshewn and explained as so many curious phenomena, and not made use of as mediums to prove\na series of philosophical propositions... [t]hey were Courses of Experiments, and his [Keill's] a\nCourse of Experimental Philosophy.30\nAn advocate and beneficiary of commercial science, Desaguliers did not invoke Hauksbee's\nlaborious status as he denied the rational, natural philosophical quality of his rival's\nexperiments. Whether or not we agree with Desaguliers, the issue of historical interest is\nto explain the more generous judgements of von Uffenbach and Desmarest, and the\ndecidedly less generous behaviour of the Royal Society.31 Until recently, Desmarest's image\nof the progressive, experimental natural philosopher has prevailed. Henri Guerlac, in his\n1974 biography, found Desmarest's assessment 'valuable'.32 But how is today's historian\nto explain the importance of pioneering professional experimenters and lecturers like\nHauksbee as they set about their work for the Society ? As public experimental science was\nforged in front of it, did the Society treat them as true philosophers, plain experimenters,\nmere servants, or some paradoxical melange of all three ? The answer depends first upon\ndiscovering who did the work, and then upon locating that work more precisely within\nAugustan ideologies.\n28 Desmarest, op. cit. (27), i, pp. xl-xliii.\n29 The first known contact between Hauksbee and either Newton or the Royal Society was his performance\nwith his improved air-pump at the first meeting over which Newton presided, on 15 December 1703. He was\nordered 5 guineas in July 1704. He then proposed, but was denied, more regular payment, and was told that 'he\nwould be gratified according to the proportion of his services'. See JB, 15\/12\/04, 55, and CM, 12\/7\/04, 126.\n30 Desaguliers, op. cit. (16), Preface, p. cr. Volume 11 appeared in London, 1744. According to Henry Guerlac\nin DSB, s.v. 'Hauksbee, Francis', Hauksbee did not himself lecture until 1710. He engaged the mathematician\nJames Hodgson to lecture for him in 1704.\n31 For Hauksbee junior's involvement with the Society see below. For Desaguliers' relations with the divided\nHauksbee family see Stewart, op. cit. (2), 120.\n32 DSB, s.v. 'Hauksbee, Francis [1666\u20141713]'. For an earlier but more extensive discussion see Guerlac, op.\ncit. (22).\nWho did the work? 139\nWHO DID THE WORK?\nWhich men, and what kind of men, carried out experiments at the early Society ? While this\nonly requires a trawl through the minutes of meetings, methodological caution and\nexplication are required. First, I have begun my analysis with the reconvening of the Society\nin 1666, when the early, enthusiastic contributions of many individual virtuosi permanently\ndried up, leaving the work to a few dedicated men.33 Secondly, I am concerned only with\nexperimenters who made more than one or two isolated contributions. The first to be\nexcluded by this yardstick is a president, Sir Isaac Newton, who made only four public\nperformances in eleven years, three in the first year of his presidency.34 This represents\nsuperhuman dedication for a Fellow of independent means.\nIt is true that these criteria exclude what little virtuoso activity there was between 1660\nand 1730, but that does not render the argument circular. As my earlier study emphasized,\ngentlemen Fellows could perform experiments, did so frequently before 1665, and probably\ncontinued to do so privately. When the Society invented the term 'curator of experiments'\nit had in mind anyone who 'took care of an investigation. But public science was being\ninvented in its meetings and it evolved rapidly. My earlier study was limited to Hooke's\npaid or 'Setled Curatorship' and could not determine whether it was Hooke's office or his\npersonal dynamism which caused other Fellows idly to leave the experimental work to him.\nThe timescale and personnel included in the current paper suggest that more sociostructural\ncauses were indeed at work. That Fellows could, in principle, experiment in public, but\nchose to leave it to hired hands, would seem to justify excluding their one-off efforts as\ninsignificant. In this section I wish only to establish that the work which gained the early\nSociety its continuing reputation was generated by men whom the Society's Fellows did not\nvalue as experimental philosophers.\nOf more importance and difficulty is the question of what to count as an experiment.\nThis paper is concerned with those practices involving the physical and practical activities\nwhich are a routine part of modern experiment. Unfortunately, early modern usage of\n'experiment' did not always connote them. Indeed the terminology used in the Society's\nminute does not map consistently onto modern categories. Not all experiments were\ndescribed as such, as when 'Mr Hauksbee shewed a new invented air-pump and in it, upon\nthe mercury descending, a Light'. Experiments, instruments and even curiosities from\ngentlemen's cabinets were equally 'shewn'.35 By comparison with the seventeenth-century\nminutes, those taken during Newton's reign employ a more consistently modern notion of\n'experiment'.36\nSince our focus is 'work', rather than 'experiment as an actor's category', we are forced\nto select, and selection risks privileging those performances conforming to modern\n33 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 4-7.\n34 See JB, 17\/5\/04, 75; JB, 31\/5\/04, 76; and JB, 21\/6\/04, 79. These were on burning glasses. See also JB,\n19\/5\/08, 187, on colours.\n35 See JB, 15\/12\/03,55. Compare the showing of a large cock's leg, a horse's stone and ' the pizzle of a possum'\nin JB, 12\/1\/03-4, 57, and that of Hauksbee's water gauge in JB, 15\/3\/04, 67.\n36 Linguistic criteria bring their own illumination to the history of early modern experiment. See C. Schmitt,\n'Experience and experiment: a comparison of Zabarella's view with Galileo's in De motu', Studies in the\nRenaissance (1969), 16, 80-138.\n140 Stephen Pumfrey\nexperimental practice. Marie Boas Hall's Promoting Experimental Learning: Experiment\nand the Royal Society,37 whilst extremely useful in many ways, has been charged with using\nthe criteria for an experiment too unreflectively in this regard. She excludes, for example,\ntrials of apparatus and demonstrations of instruments.38 The anatomical and natural\nhistorical work is particularly hard to classify, because it ranged from systematic\ndissections to simple exhibitions of an unusual phenomenon like a possum's penis. Virtuosi\ncontinued frequently to exhibit, 'experimentally', items from their cabinets of curiosities,\nbut I have only counted performances which require some form of technical, practical or\nmanual activity.39 Such selection is not petitio principii, but a necessary filter for catching\nthose who were prepared to roll up their sleeves and dirty their hands for the Society's\ndeclared cause of the promotion of natural knowledge.\nFollowing these criteria, it emerges that the overwhelming burden of the Society's work\nin the six decades after 1666 devolved upon the twelve men listed below. To them must be\nadded Nehemia Grew, who was primarily active as a curator of plants from 1672 to 1679,\nand James Douglas, whose work as a curator of anatomy around 1706-07 briefly and\nineffectually filled the Society's rarely met need for this kind of experiment. Although a\ndifference between my criteria and those of Boas Hall has been admitted, it is instructive\nto compare her charts of experimental activity with the active periods of the men emerging\non my list. What Boas Hall found to be a very uneven scatter of narrow peaks of industry,\nseparated by expanses of dismal inactivity, resolves into a sequence of active periods of the\nsame twelve individuals.40\nThus the Society's fortune was contingent almost from the beginning upon finding\nindividual men willing to do its work. That there was little contingency in the class of men\nwhom it considered suitable emerges from a comparison of the individuals' curricula vitae.\nTHE TWELVE CHIEF EXPERIMENTERS\nRobert Hooke (1632-1701) came from a very poor clerical family.41 His Westminster and\nOxford education depended upon scholarships. While in Oxford he became an 'operator'\nfor Robert Boyle, and his mechanical skills were critical for the design of 'Boyle's' air-\npump. In 1662 Boyle obtained a similar position for Hooke with the Royal Society and\ngained 'the thanks of the society for dispensing with him for their use'. He impressed\n37 Boas Hall, op. cit. (20). I have relied upon her analysis for the very slack period, from the point of view of\nexperiment, between 1688 and 1702.\n38 Boas Hall, op. cit. (20), 4-5, where she is refreshingly open about her criteria. My reservations have been\nshared by other reviewers, such as Peter Dear in his (1993), 84, 148-9.\n39 The work of the anatomy 'curator' James Douglas (see below) is a case in point. Douglas 'showed' both\ndissections and monstrosities, such as the skull of a mouthless puppy. See JB, 29\/10\/07, 164.1 have not counted\nthe latter as experimental work.\n40 Westfall, op. cit. (22), 634. See below for Richard Lower and Edward Tyson. For graphs of activity from\n1660 to 1727, see Boas Hall, op. cit. (20). Each chronological chapter is accompanied by one. The following list\nof individuals is arranged chronologically according to periods of activity in the Society.\n41 For Hooke's biography, see M. Espinasse, Robert Hooke, London, 1956. For more recent assessments see\nHunter and Schaffer op. cit. (14), and Pumfrey, op. cit. (14).\nWho did the work? 141\nenough to be made a paid curator and, later, a Fellow. He achieved international\nrecognition through Micrographia, a publication of his microscopical observations\noriginally prepared by the Society for presentation to Charles II. His relationship with the\nfellowship was later marred by his pursuit of other employments, such as surveying and\nlecturing, and the concomitant, acrimonious disputes about whether he had fulfilled the\nconditions of his stipend. In 1679 he successfully advanced Denis Papin as the Society's\nregular, paid experimenter. Hooke now lacked power but was rich enough not to depend\nupon his \u00a350 p.a. stipend. He continued to contribute occasional discourses, and a final\nexperiment in 1696, one of the two performed during that year.42\nRichard Lower (1631-91) was an Oxford-trained physician and physiologist. Hoping\nthat he could rectify the Society's dearth of anatomical experiments, Boyle and Hooke\npromoted him as a paid curator of anatomy, believing him to be a 'fit' person with\n'inclinations to such an employment'. A Hooke-like burst of activity resulted in offers of\na Fellowship, which he accepted, and a curatorship, which he declined 'on account of some\nbusiness, in which he was at present engaged'. The Society did not renew the offer, perhaps\nbecause the statutes demanded exclusive employment of their curators. Lower rapidly\nbecame an inactive and unsuitable Fellow, and achieved the rare distinction of being\nexpelled in 1675.43\nFrederick Slare (1648-1727) and Edward Tyson (1650-1708) are my list's odd men out.\nThey were already well-established gentleman Fellows when they were appointed to curate\nexperiments in 1682, with Tyson reviving the curatorship of anatomy. Their posts resulted\nfrom a major shake-up in the Society's organization, specifically designed to revive the\nexperimental focus of meetings following Hooke's consistent failure to fulfil his promises.\nIndeed Slare was implicated in Hooke's sacking as Secretary and his subsequent\nmarginalization. Slare and Tyson temporarily rectified Hooke's dereliction of duty with\nprogrammes of experiments in 1682-83, before slipping back into the typical spectatorial\nroles.44 The minutes make clear that they were remunerated for expenses and loss of\nleisure, an arrangement which the founders considered appropriate to gentlemen curators.\nUnlike Hooke they were not paid for labour or services.\nDenis Papin (1647-c. 1712) was a Huguenot Hooke who met a tragic end. Possessed of\na medical degree but of 'always inadequate finances', Papin scoured Europe for scientific\nemployment and patrons. He began by playing Hooke to Huygens' Boyle in work on the\nair-pump at the Academie des Sciences, and moved on to serve Boyle himself. Having\ndeveloped his 'steam digester' he was introduced to the Society by Boyle and Hooke in\nMay 1679. Although he was paid as a clerk, his service consisted primarily of triumphant\nexperiments, which were published by the Society as The Digester in 1680, and which\nbrought him a Fellowship. When a better position could not be formalized he left, using\nhis new fame to direct experiments at the Venetian academy of Giovanni Ambrosio Sarotti,\nwhom he probably had met at the Society's meetings. He returned to the Society between\n1684 and 1687 as a 'temporary curator' at \u00a330 p.a. Again the Society could not pay him\n42 Boas Hall, op. cit. (20), 94.\n43 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 39 n23.\n44 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 8-10, 32-5.\n142 Stephen Pumfrey\nenough46 and he moved on to work in the German courts, where he received information\nfrom Leibniz about Savery's steam-engine. For some reason he returned and attended\nmeetings after March 1707\/8. Although his proposals for engines (and for the Society's\ninvestment in them) were impractical,46 his cold reception, particularly from Newton, is\nstriking even in the light of his connection with Leibniz.47 Newton insisted upon being\npresent when Papin performed,48 and the Council 'thought it not proper to engage Dr\nPapin in their Service by a certain Salary', although they agreed to his proposal 'to show\nsome new experiments to the Society and to leave his Gratification to the Councill'.49 In\n1711 Council ordered that 'Mr Papin do remove his apparatus for Experiments out of the\nKitchen, which will be necessary for Mr Hunt', and the question 'whether Mr Papin\nshould have ten pounds for his services' went to a ballot.50 Papin finally retired from the\nunequal struggle for livelihood late in 1712, after a derivative proposal to soften fruit and\nnuts in his digester, and he died in obscurity shortly afterwards.51 Papin provides the best\nexample of the perilous position of the gifted 'scientist' who, in a society which could not\nrecognize genius coupled with financial dependence, was in constant danger of being\nreduced from conditions of service to those of servitude and servility.\nHenry Hunt (d. 1713) was the Society's operator and general dogsbody who rose to\nbecome 'Keeper of the House, Repository and Library' at a salary of \u00a340p.a. Usually\nunnamed in the minutes, no natural philosopher and never a Fellow, Hunt became visible\nat times of crisis in the provision of experiments. He is first named in 1683 when Martin\nLister, who wanted to counter Hooke's programme of mechanical experiments, employed\nhim to perform before the Society. Under Newton's presidency Hunt provided the major\nexperimental support for Hauksbee and in 1711, as mentioned above, was preferred to\nDenis Papin.52 In June 1713, shortly after Hauksbee's death, Hunt was perfunctorily\nreferred to as 'being dead since the last meeting'. The listed duties of his successor, one\nAlban Thomas, included cleaning, escorting visitors, collecting monies, and to 'deliver out\nthe orders of the President and Council'.53\nEdmund Halley (1656-1742) had been a somewhat genteel Fellow since 1679, but a\nfamily dispute soon left him apparently in financial difficulties and he began to take up paid\npositions at the Society. In 1684 he was appointed 'in the manner of a curator; and he was\n45 According to the DNB, Papin 'sought the more lucrative post of secretary, but Halley was elected in his\nstead'. I find no record of this in Birch, op. cit. (21), but it would confirm the use of such positions by would-\nbe professional experimenters.\n46 JB, 17\/3\/07-8, 179; JB, 14\/4\/08, 182; JB, 21\/4\/08, 184; JB, 18\/5\/09, 214; JB, 26\/4\/11, 278-80.\n47 According to the DSB, Leibniz wrote to the Royal Society Council about Papin in February 1707\/8.\n48 JB, 14\/4\/08, 182. Newton referred discussion of Papin's payment to Council on 27\/12\/11. Unlike other\nprojectors and instrument makers such as Kerridge and Fahrenheit, Papin was already a Fellow and did not need\npermission to attend meetings.\n49 CM, 22\/12\/08, 158; CM, 23\/2\/09, 160.\n50 CM, 2\/8\/11, 192; CM, 4\/1\/11-12, 199. Unlike other ballots of the period, the result was not recorded\nnemine contradicente.\n51 JB, 16\/10\/12, 421.\n52 Hunt performed experiments, for example, on gunpowder (JB, 15\/3\/03-4, 67), sulphur (JB, 28\/2\/04-5, 97),\na pike (JB, 7\/11\/06, 114), magnetism (JB, 19\/12\/05, 116; JB, 10\/4\/06, 128) and on temperature (JB, 12\/1\/08-9,\n203). For Hunt's earlier assistance to Lister, see Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 35-6.\n53 JB, 25\/6\/13, 500; CM, 29\/6\/13, 211; CM, 7\/12\/13, 215.\nWho did the work? 143\ninformed, that he should be considered for it as others had been' . He began with magnetic\nexperiments, and continued until 1691. In 1686 he won what the statutes describe as the\n' labor ious ' office of clerk, which carried \u00a350 p.a. and required the resignation of his\nFellowship. As his situation consolidated he ceased his public experiments for the Society.54\nFrancis Hauksbee the elder (c. 1666-1713) was a one-time apprenticed draper. Probably\nan established instrument maker by 1704, he emerged from obscurity as Newton's operator\n(or 'servant ') and as a public demonstrator for lectures at Ayers Writing School given by\nJames Hodgson and, later, William Whiston. It has been suggested that he was instructed\nby Papin. Like Papin and Hooke he was made FRS after months of sterling service. Also\nlike Hooke, his work was generally 'ordered ' rather than 'desired' as was other Fellows'.\nHe was paid according to his efforts, which were normally worth about \u00a340 upon\nproduction of receipts. By 1710 he was famous enough to attract foreigners to Wine Office\nCourt, and he now lectured as well as demonstrated. Hauksbee's range of employments,\nwhich certainly put him into the category of minor capitalists of the lower middle class,\nprobably explains why the Society never granted him the regular or 'setled' office of\ncurator, which demanded full-time service.55\nFrancis Hauksbee the younger (1688-1763), was the nephew of the elder Hauksbee. In\nhis lifetime he was both less and more successful than his uncle as an experimentalist,\nalthough he has never achieved his uncle's retrospective eminence as a scientist. He seems\nto have begun under his uncle's wing, but by 1712 had set up as a rival maker and public\ndemonstrator of instruments. Soon after his uncle's death in 1713 he was in partnership\nwith his uncle's partner, the now disgraced Whiston. Desaguliers inaugurated new lectures\non behalf of Hauksbee's widowed aunt.56 Hauksbee himself earned 5 guineas from the\nSociety for his brief 'services since his unkles death he giving a receipt in full'.67 On that\noccasion, services were required when the Due d'Aumont suddenly announced his desire\nto attend and be elected a Fellow.58 It would seem that no Fellow felt motivated, competent\nor suited to introduce the duke to experimental Newtonianism. They turned to a hired\nhand, but the younger Hauksbee seems not to have impressed. Certainly he lost an\nopportunity, since his rival Desaguliers became his uncle's permanent replacement in the\n54 For Halley, see Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 15-16 and C. A. Ronan, Edmond Halley: Genius in Eclipse, London,\n1975, 63-75. Halley's only 'experimental' contribution after 1692 was an observation of the variation, reported\nin JB, 3\/7\/05, 110.\n55 The most convenient summary of Hauksbee's life remains Guerlac's entry in DSB.\n56 Stewart, op. cit. (2), 120.\n57 CM, 24\/8\/13, 212. This is the last reference under Newton's presidency, until he re-emerged as\nhousekeeper. He came recommended 'by divers members of the Society', but not by Newton, whose favourite\nwas one Thomas Overton, nor by Desaguliers, who backed Thomas Glover. See CM, 4\/4\/23, 267.\n58 Following Hauksbee the elder's last performance on 29 January 1713, experiments ceased. When on 21 May\n1713 d'Aumont's arrival was announced just before the meeting commenced 'Mr Hauksbee was ordered to\nprepare some particular Experiments for his Entertainment' (JB, 21\/5\/13, 483). It was thought proper to defer\nthe usual reading of papers for a Newtonian display, and the duke 'was entertained with severall experiments of\nthe production of light by friction, or elasticity, of the mutuall Attraction of the Parts of Matter, of the curve\ncaused by the Rising of a Fluid between glass planes, e tc ' Sloane stalled by showing curiosities in the repository,\nand contributed an 'experiment of the Stone called Oculus Mundi'. Whilst the attendance of 'Mr [George]\nBerkeley, a clergyman' did not provoke experimentation, the return of d'Aumont panicked them into a repertoire\nof air-pump experiments, presumably again by Hauksbee junior. See JB, 11\/6\/13, 492.\n144 Stephen Pumfrey\nSociety. He nevertheless returned as the Society's keeper and clerk in 1723, winning a\ngruelling and ungentlemanly selection procedure occasioned after Alban Thomas had\nabsconded. He did not experiment and never obtained a Fellowship, although his office\nprecluded that honour.59 The lack mattered less as commercial science expanded, and\nHauksbee became an active partner in several lecturing, inventing and patent schemes.\nJean Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744) is one of the better known experimenters.\nLarry Stewart has firmly established his roles in the lecturing community and the Royal\nSociety. His father was a Huguenot refugee and minor London schoolteacher. Desaguliers\nwent to Oxford and, after proceeding BA, briefly took over the lectures in experimental\nphilosophy of John Keill, with whom he had studied. Economic necessity, caused by his\nmarriage in 1712, is the most plausible explanation for his move to London where he\nsucceeded Hauksbee the elder, first as lecturer and then as the Society's paid experimenter.\nDesaguliers was first proposed as a Fellow by Hans Sloane in July 1713, but nothing had\ncome of it before Newton proposed him a year later. In this, however, Desaguliers' career\ndiffered little from that of the other employees who lacked social status. Instead months\nof service commuted into Fellowship and cachet. Once elected Desaguliers was excused his\nfees '[i]n consideration of his great usefulnesse to the Royal Society as Curator and\nOperator of Experiments'.60 The first record of his attendance shows him treated less as\na virtuoso than as a servant: 'It was ordered that Mr. Aguiliers be desired to wait on the\nPresident to take his directions as to the structure of that Instrument and the Experiments\nto be made.'61 Years later, Desaguliers could still be admonished, as Hooke had been, for\nthe neglect of his duties. He also followed Hooke in introducing to the Society his own\nclients like Thomas Glover.62 His income was performance related, typically \u00a330 often\nsupplemented with Copley's \u00a35 donation.63\nDaniel Fahrenheit (1686-1736) came from a family of bourgeois traders in Gdansk. His\nparents died suddenly in 1701 and he was sent to the Dutch Republic to learn commerce,\nwhere he chose the new and growing scientific instrument business. He toured Europe\nmaking contacts before establishing himself in Amsterdam in 1717, with a novel line in\nthermometers. He arrived before the Royal Society on 5 March 1723\/4, during a phase of\nexperimental torpor, and the 'Gentleman of Dantzick had leave to be present'. In a series\n59 For details of the selection process see the fascinating CM, 4\/4\/23, 267. Each candidate was 'examined in\nthe following particulars' of handwriting, languages 'skill in Natural Knowledge or History', librarianship, and\n'the sufficiency of the Security they were able to give for their Trust'. Hauksbee offered \u00a3400-500 against any\nmisdemeanour. This was a sensitive matter because Alban Thomas had absconded leaving debts. The Society\nconsidered legal proceedings (CM, 30\/11\/23, 275; CM, 12\/3\/24-5, 276), but was ultimately benevolent (CM,\n3\/11\/26, 297-8). As with Halley's election to the Clerkship, the conditions imposed on the housekeeper\nwere ungentlemanly and incompatible with Fellowship, but manifestly compatible with the performance of\nexperimental work.\n60 Note that this is not the same as Hooke's Curatorship by Office. Desaguliers was paid according to his\nefforts. Newton generally preferred payments to be 'esteemed as a gratuity and not [to] be drawn into a president\n[sic]'. See CM, 5\/11\/19, 251: CM, 12\/12\/16, 257.\n61 JB, 18\/2\/13-14, 546.\n62 CM, 17\/11\/26,299. Desaguliers also introduced his co-projectors William Vream and Henry Beighton. See\nJB, 4\/4\/23, 267, 269, and Stewart, op. cit. (2), 225.\n63 This was initially a monetary payment only. A medal was also awarded from 1736, which Desaguliers won.\nThe first person other than Desaguliers to receive the \u00a35 was Stephen Gray in 1731 and 1732. See Boas Hall, op.\ncit. (20), 130-1.\nWho did the work? 145\nof experiments up to 30 April he demonstrated his instruments for measuring temperature\nand specific gravity, during which time Desaguliers proposed him for a Fellowship.64\nSloane raised at Council the case of 'Mr Fahrenheit who had for some time made it his\nbuisness [sic] to communicate the description of divers new Instruments by him invented\nfor making Experiments in Natural Philosophy. And whose constant attendance on the\nSociety seemed to require some sort of acknowledgement.' That 'sort' was determined to\nbe a payment of 10 guineas.\nStephen Gray (c. 1666-1736) performed his major experimental work for the Royal\nSociety after 1730. Gray's faltering career provides some of the best evidence of the\nAugustan tensions between scientific accomplishment, manual labour and social status. He\ncontinued the rise of his family of dyers from the artisanry into the middle orders, and he\napplied his family's values of self-education to the study of nature. He was at ease with\nacquaintances like Henry Hunt and John Flamsteed (his mentor and quasi-patron but also\nthe son of a tradesman). He was less at ease with the virtuosi. When he was offered Hunt's\nlowly position at the Society in 1711, Brook Taylor recorded that 'the poor man [was] so\nvery bashful that I can by no means prevail upon him to think of the business'. However,\npoor health made him dependent upon his connections with natural philosophers, such as\nRoger Cotes (whom he had assisted at Cambridge) and William Derham. He was thus\nstimulated to seek the Society's patronage, and in 1719 he became a 'gentleman pensioner'\nof Charterhouse.65\nEver since Hooke had introduced him in 1696, Gray had been known to Fellows as an\nobservant microscopist. He contributed reports of electrical experiments in the 1700s, but\nthey were appropriated by Hauksbee the elder, and he held back until 1720. Following his\nwork and collaboration with the young and wealthy FRS Granville Wheler (a relationship\nwhich would make a fascinating case study in this context),66 Gray's experiments and\nreports produced another flurry of activity at the Royal Society, which led to his own\nelection in 1732. Like the other poor but diligent experimenters, it was agreed at the same\ntime that he should be excused all fees and payments 'and that he should have the five\npounds paid him, which were left by Sir Godfrey Copley, for the experiments he made for\nthe year 1732*.67 The Society was keen to encourage him but Secretary Mortimer found\nhim dying in Charterhouse.\nOTHER PAID ' C U R A T O R S '\nThese twelve good men were responsible for all but a fraction of the Society's experimental\nactivity during this period. They all literally 'curated' experiments but, given the flexible\nand evolving meaning of curatorship, they were not all formally appointed as 'Curators'\nby the Society. Others, even though they did little work, were appointed or paid to fill this\nposition. For completeness, they were:\nNehemiah Grew (1641-1712). Grew was appointed 'curator of the anatomy of plants' in\n1672. His father was a Coventry non-conforming clergyman who resigned in 1662. Grew\n64 JB, 5\/3-30\/4\/24, 443ff.\n65 I have not studied Gray's work after 1730, and my account relies upon those of Heilbron, op. cit. (18) and\nop. cit. (21), and his entry in DSB, s.v. 'Gray, Stephen'.\n66 I am grateful to Simon Schaffer for this suggestion.\n67 CM, 28\/2\/32-3, 122.\n146 Stephen Pumfrey\nmay have developed an unlicensed medical practice because he satisfied the Leiden Faculty\nof Medicine (Cambridge being closed to dissenters) with a dissertation De liquore nervoso\nin 1671. Recognizing a man both gifted and needy, Hooke proposed him for a Fellowship,\nand the Society offered a second paid curatorship. This entailed Grew abandoning his\nCoventry practice for a maximum income of \u00a350, or whatever subscriptions the Society\ncould raise. Grew informed Oldenburg that the income 'would not (as I have tryd) have\namounted to the profit...from my practise in the Country'. The subsequently chequered\nhistory of Grew's project follows the Society's ability to find funds for him. 'Why Grew's\ncontribution to the business of the Society virtually ceased in the summer of 1679 is not\nknown', writes Hunter, although he suspects that, as with other physician Fellows, it 'was\ndue to an increasing preoccupation with other business'.68\n'Dr' James Douglas (1675-1742) was, on one occasion in 1707, ordered a payment of\n\u00a310 for dissections.69 The Society's Journal Book is not informative about what Douglas\ndid, although he was given a Fellowship in the November 1706 elections. It is possible,\nthen, that Douglas was one of the climbers who first impressed with a few performances,\nwas then rewarded with a Fellowship (and money), after which he traded on the prestige\nof membership and fell idle.\nJohn Lowthorp (dates unknown70) is another 'curator' who does not fit my pattern. He\nalso left no visible trace of any work. His case is an interesting one because he was in the\ngroup of councillors, which included John Harris and John Van de Bemde and which was\nled by John Woodward, whose resistance to the Newton-Sloane domination of the Society\ncame to a head in March 1710.71 It seems that in November 1708 Council debated the\nmerits of Hauksbee's, and by implication Newton's control of the experimental\nprogramme. 'It was ordered that Mr Hauksbee should go on and show experiments for the\nnext year, and that the Councill of the Society will pay him as he deserves. It was desired\nthat Mr Bemde should signify the same order to Mr. Lowthorp.' Lowthorp was\nimmediately excused his subscriptions, presumably in recognition of the experiments he\nwould perform.72 However, none are recorded and, once the rebels had been routed, 'it\nwas ordered that Mr Lowthorp be demanded his contributions from the last time he was\nexcused, viz. from the 28th of January, 1708\/9 \\7 3 It is not unreasonable to read these\nevents as an attempt to mount a non-Newtonian experimental programme, which failed\nnot least because gentleman Fellow Lowthorp proved unequal to the work. One might read\nin the same light the arguments over Papin's return, and Newton's resistance to it. If so,\nthen these are intriguing signs of opposition to the way that President Newton employed\nfirst Hauksbee and then Desaguliers to turn the Society's limited work in experimental\nphysics into a consolidation of his own programme.\n68 Hunter, op. cit.

Their effectiveness in altering\nthe experimental agenda was very slight. The remaining twelve histories show remarkable\ndegrees of commonality, which can usefully be summarized before moving on to their\nsignificance in Augustan society.\nFirst, experimental work had connotations of mechanical service. The Society's\nexperiments were performed not by virtuoso gentlemen, but by middle-class men of trade\nand employment who were their social and economic inferiors. The performers were\nemergent 'professionals' of the same social stratum from which science lecturers were\ndrawn. Indeed, most were themselves involved in public demonstration. They all depended\nfor their livelihood, certainly at first, upon the small incomes available from the Society's\ncuratorships, lecturing, operating for philosophers or instrument making.\nIt is, perhaps, no surprise that the Society's experiments were primarily performed by\nthose whom it paid, but the payments must be put into context. The gentleman curator like\nSlare, a rare species after 1665, was reimbursed for the sacrifice of his leisure.74 By contrast,\nthe chief workers came from straitened circumstances, and were trying to climb up the\nmiddle orders of society using the novel route of professional public experiment. Hooke's,\nHunt's, Hauksbee's and Gray's impoverished origins are indisputable. Grew nearly\nrejected his position, and Lower actually did so, because they could not afford to abandon\nfledgling medical practices for the Society's small and unreliable stipends. Halley and\nFahrenheit both failed to receive expected family inheritances, and found alternative\ncareers in natural philosophy. Henry Hunt was the Society's dogsbody. The Huguenot\nemigres Papin and Desaguliers, despite university educations, depended upon high-risk\nscientific patronage. Their fortunes fluctuated but in both cases when their patronage dried\nup they declined, and they apparently died in poverty.75\nThus the Society left its experimental orders with men who were described as useful, 'fit\nfor employment' and 'service' or, in Fahrenheit's case, in 'constant attendance on the\nSociety' which was valued at 10 guineas.76 Conceding that the minutes adopt a consistently\nformal style, it must be noted that the language of employment and service was never\napplied to the leisured gentleman experimenter. Nor were virtuoso Fellows personally\nrebuked for dilatoriness.77 All this points to a systematic and significant pattern of\nbehaviour influenced by Augustan norms of the master-servant relationship. The service\n74 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 9.\n75 For Papin, see DSB, s.v. 'Papin, Denis'; for Desaguliers' decline see L. Stewart, 'Public lectures and private\npatronage', Isis (1986), 77, 47-58.\n76 For Fahrenheit see CM, 7\/5\/24,279.' [Fahrenheit's] constant attendance upon the Society seemed to require\nsome sort of acknowledgement' which was 10 guineas. Fahrenheit was another who arrived as an unknown, was\n'given leave' to attend meetings because he was not a Fellow, and provided experimental entertainment, as\nrecorded in JB, 5 \/3 \/23^ , 443'; JB, 26\/3\/24,454; JB, 2\/4\/24,457; JB, 23\/4\/24,467 and JB, 30\/4\/24, 470. Having\nperformed thermometric experiments and demonstrated instruments, Fahrenheit was proposed for a Fellowship\nby Desaguliers at the meeting of 26 March 1724 and subsequently elected.\n77 See Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 7 and 38 n26 and CM, 17\/11\/26 for Hooke's and Desaguliers' rebukes.\n148 Stephen Putnfrey\nin question was not to the abstract master of 'science' but to the corporeal masters of the\nPresident and Fellowship.\nSecondly, and more contentiously, I conclude that employees were not recognized as\nexperimental philosophers. Sceptics might argue that the Society's virtuosi considered\nscientific ability, and their own forum, to be peculiarly independent of the issues of social\nstatus and hierarchy. Good minds were surely recruited and welcomed wherever they could\nbe found. This counter-argument could be extended to suggest that, since the gentlemen\nFellows needed no recompense, it was an act of benevolence to cede the pleasure of\nexperimenting to needy individuals. But the evidence of the Society's statutory\/minuted\nand quotidian\/actual treatment of them belies the point. Besides, there is the chronology\nof their election to Fellowships: the biographies show how they were only elected once they\nhad proved the value of their service, despite their apparent status (to us) as 'notable\nscientists'. The exceptions here are Slare, Tyson and Halley. Halley, extraordinarily, was\ncompelled to resign his Fellowship when he became clerk, and his successors, Thomas and\nHauksbee junior, were never considered for election. One might have thought that, in a\nperiod when elections were scandalously frequent and experiments scandalously rare,\nanyone proven or even rumoured to be an adept experimenter would have been enrolled.\nAnd yet, when the Society needed an experimentalist, it was forced to recruit outside and\nbelow its ranks to men frequently of unknown or uncomfortable provenance. Whereas\ngentlemen Fellows' honour and worth were presumed, mechanical men were subjected to\nrigorous investigation.\nThirdly, there is very little evidence that the Fellows of the early Royal Society invested\nthe practical activity of performing publicly verifiable experiments with any real\ncommitment or dignity.78 They freely engaged in the genteel or manly exercises of\ngeometrizing, calculating, exhibiting and discoursing, even discoursing on the necessity of\nexperiments to real philosophy. But, with the partial exception of Newton, they watched\nwhile others were paid for the dirty, sweaty mechanical work. In the triangle of reason,\nlabour and status, the Fellows were radical in allowing reason to confer status: the Royal\nSociety proclaimed by its very existence that scholarship and gentility were compatible. But\nthey were conservative when they differentiated paid, labouring 'professional scientists'\nfrom experimental philosophers. 'Promoting Experimental Learning' did not mean\nperforming experimental work.\nGiven the above, early obscurity, poor treatment and constant worries about poverty\nand rejection turn out to be the typical profile of an Augustan experimenter, and nowhere\nnear as surprising as some historians have thought. Nor is the spasmodic nature of the\nSociety's experimental programme; and we can abandon our perception of the early\nSociety in a permanent experimental crisis or decline. Once Fellows stopped curating after\n1665, the Society's programme depended upon the circumstances of a few individuals, and\ntheir ability to retain the Society's favour. In the rare cases where they achieved partial\nrecognition for their work, it depended upon their ability to use their achievements to\ntransform their ascribed status of servant into the de facto status of natural philosopher.\nSo great are the similarities between the twelve that one is tempted to construct an ideal\ntype of Augustan experimental worker. He is born (perhaps without historical trace) into\n78 Though this is not to deny that they did experiment privately, and occasionally publicly. This is discussed\nbelow.\nWho did the work? 149\na family of the middle orders, which is aware that in England education and commerce\noffer ever-expanding opportunities for self-help and social advancement. He develops his\nskills in experimental philosophy by serving a patron, often a Fellow of the Royal Society,\nas Hooke served Boyle, or Gray Roger Cotes. He is introduced by a patron to the Society\nwhen it needs a curator, housekeeper or other servant. He works diligently for some\nmonths, after which his labour is rewarded with money and a Fellowship. He is allowed\nto publish his work in the Philosophical Transactions, or he writes it up as a book of\nnatural philosophy, as Papin did with his Digester. This produces a reputation in London\nand abroad as an experimental philosopher. He cashes in the credit through bigger\ninstrument sales, lecture subscriptions, consultancy and clientage contacts, and other\npositions over which Fellows have influence. For Hooke and Halley, these also included a\nbetter position within the Society itself. Foreign observers now mistake him as a jewel in\nthe Fellowship's illustrious crown. Success reduces, but never removes the obligation of\nservice to one's colleagues. But his success elsewhere brings about a crisis in the supply of\nexperiments, and the Society looks for a new man. He tries to advance his own trainees\nand contacts, as Hooke did for Papin, Hauksbee for his nephew, and as Desaguliers tried\nto do for Glover. Hooke, Papin, Desaguliers and Gray, moreover, all explicitly used the\nSociety to gain outside positions, but in this they were no different from (although more\nexperimentally industrious than) the increasing numbers of would-be professionals,\nespecially medical men like Lower and Douglas and possibly Grew, who sat on the benches\nuntil they had acquired the polish needed by a successful physician.\nBut an emphasis upon commonalities and an ideal type gives the false impression that\nthe community of paid experimenters changed little from the 1660s to the 1720s. In\nactuality, individual, structural and intellectual relations were transformed. Newton's\nimperious presidency created a very different climate and role for experimentation from\nthat of Hooke's heyday. Structurally, the fact that Augustan England witnessed the\nworking through of many of the tensions of a commercializing society improved the\nposition of the paid, public science demonstrator within the changing triangle of labour,\nreason and status. The intervening development of commercialized science crucially altered\nthe kinds of service expected, and of experiments performed. This in turn led to a greater\nphilosophical value being placed on the work, and the workers.\nPUTTING MEN IN THEIR PLACE - THE VIEWS OF LOCKE AND\nSPRAT\nIn a modern, scientific society it makes little sense to ask whether Robert Hooke was an\nexperimental philosopher or a mere experimenter. To Augustans, even to a progressive,\npro-commercial Whig theorist like John Locke, it was an ideologically crucial question.\nLocke's vision was of a polity radically divided into two distinct sorts of men. In his Second\nTreatise, Locke stated:\nGod gave the World to Men in Common; but since He gave it them for their benefit... it cannot\nbe supposed He meant it should always remain common and uncultivated. He gave it to the use\nof the Industrious and Rational, (and Labour was to be his Title to it;) not to the Fancy or\nCovetousness of the Quarrelsom and Contentious.79\n79 Locke, op. cit. (10), 309 (\u00a734).\n150 Stephen Pumfrey\nWhilst his insistence upon labour as man's title is evidence that Locke's state of nature is\nno Eden of Tory paternalism but remarkably like the commercial, 'improving' society\nevolving in his own time, scholars disagree about the assumptions which permitted Locke\nto discount the 'Quarrelsom and Contentious' majority. MacPherson counters readings of\nLocke as a liberal democrat by drawing attention to Locke's denial of citizenship and even\nreason itself to the vast majority of men (and, we might add, to all women - explicitly and\nimplicitly respectively). Instead, he reads Locke as a thoroughgoing theorist of early\ncapitalism, for whom 'irrational' labourers alienate their labour to bourgeois\nentrepreneurs.80 Tully, in an acclaimed study of 1980, argues that MacPherson has\nmisinterpreted Locke's concept of the labour relationship: 'All that Locke assumes is the\nmaster-servant relation. It is not... the wage relationship of capitalism.'81 Tully notes that\nLocke himself described the relation 'Master and Servant', making the servant a free man:\na Free-man makes himself a Servant to another, by selling him for a certain time, the Service he\nundertakes to do, in exchange for Wages he is to receive: And though this commonly puts him\ninto the Family of his Master, and under the ordinary discipline thereof, yet it gives the Master\nbut a Temporary Power over him.82\nTully is persuaded that Locke's servants are like craftsmen, who can perform their work\nundirected. They differ from apprentices, whose genuinely servile treatment in the period\nflowed from their dependence upon a master's direction.83 Servants do not, therefore,\nalienate their capacity to labour, but only the labour embodied in a complete service or\ncommodity. It goes without saying that, in this sense, the product together with the\nembodied labour is the master's. Tully considers that this 'social division of labour... was\nthe dominant and non-capitalist mode of production until at least the late eighteenth\ncentury'.84 Keith Tribe, however, suggests that writers like Locke were necessarily\nadopting and adapting pre-capitalist discourses of labour and property to a changing\nreality.86 Neal Wood has developed the criticism much further. Where Tully concluded\nthat Locke's theory of property was 'consistent with the proposals put forward by [the\nLevellers, proposals which attempted] to ensure the widest possible distribution of private\nproperty', Wood responds that '[o]n the basis of what we know of Locke and his age,\nTully's argument...simply transcends the bounds of common sense and empirical\nevidence'. Wood reasserts Locke as, inter alia, an ideologist of capitalist appropriation but,\nin an important development from MacPherson's view, one specifically of agrarian\ncapitalism.86\nIn my opinion, Wood's reading has the strength of locating Lockean theory within the\ncontext of Locke's and his allies' wider ideas and actions. He argues that Locke's\n80 Macpherson, op. cit. (13).\n81 Tully, op. cit. (9), 136.\n82 Tully, op. cit. (9), 136; Locke, op. cit. (10), 340 (\u00a785).\n83 One might speculate, in this regard, whether Newton, for example, thought of Hauksbee as an apprentice\nnatural philosopher, when he directed him in the design of instruments and experiments.\n84 Tully, op. cit. (9), 140.\n85 Tribe, op. cit. (13), 51.\n86 Tully, op. cit. (9), 169; Wood, op. cit. (13), 75.\nWho did the work? 151\nopposition to the paternalism of Tory landowners and his adoption of the agrarian\ncapitalist ethic of improvement required the active, interventionist, 'labour' theory of\nproperty. He thus established new criteria for new classes of a landed elite. It is well known\nthat elsewhere in Locke's writings, not least in his harsh prescriptions for dealing with the\npoor, he made no concession to a radical' levelling' extension of his theory (as Tully would\nhave it).87 To do so would have destabilized the emerging elite to which he belonged. His\nsolution, of denying citizenship, rational reflection, indeed full humanity, to the labouring\nclasses may seem contradictory and blatantly ideological, but it was a solution. 'The\nlabourer's share [of the national income, he wrote], being seldom more than a bare\nsubsistance, never allows that body of men, time, or opportunity to raise their thoughts\nabove that [subsistence].'88\nHow does this bear on the Royal Society? We have seen just how problematic the\nquestions of paid employment, service and labour were in a rapidly commercializing\neconomy. When we couple this ideological sensitivity to the evidence that paid\nexperimenters were treated as servants, we are surely forced to conclude that men like the\nelder Hauksbee and Desaguliers were real anomalies. Secondly, even progressive theorists\nlike Locke assumed the terms of an increasingly dysfunctional 'classical' discourse of\nsocio-economic relations, in which paid, manual labour debarred one from the small group\nof a rational, politically active gentlemanly elite. Thirdly, the conception of paid\nexperimental work as service in the traditional sense is indispensable to our understanding\nof intellectual, scientific property in the Augustan age. In contemporary ideology, landed\nindividual patrons like Robert Boyle, or gentlemanly collectives like the Royal Society,\ncould assume that air-pumps, chronometers, experimental demonstrations or even natural\nphilosophical discoveries made in their service, not to say under their masterly ' direction ',89\nwere their property. We might note that much of Hooke's chronometric research, which\nhe claimed was being stolen, was done in his capacity as an employed curator.\nLocke would surely have denied Hooke's claim. Despite the physical equivalence of the\nlabour in 'the Turfs my Servant has cut; and the Ore I have digged', when Locke\nappropriates the turves he denies any moral equivalence. The denial invokes deeply\nembedded, conservative Augustan moral distinctions between the supposedly self-\ninterested, irrational labourer, and the virtuous gentleman of property.\nWe can see this Augustan ideology explicitly invoked on behalf of the Royal Society by\nThomas Sprat. In his semi-official History of the Royal Society, Sprat propounded the\nSociety's utilitarian aim of encouraging and advancing the mechanical arts and sciences.\nThis ideology of rational, commercial improvement was similar to Locke's, and similarly\ncarried the risk of quasi-levelling, proto-radical readings. It risked the elevation of\nmechanics such as instrument makers into natural philosophers. This was neither the\nFellowship's intention nor its practice. However, Sprat employed a similarly contradictory,\n87 Locke variously described the lower orders as 'destined to labour and given up to the service of their\nbellies', and who, in religion, 'cannot know and therefore must believe'. See Macpherson, op. cit. (13), 223.\n88 Macpherson, op. cit. (13), 223.\n89 The Society's minutes frequently record the direction of experimenters by the virtuoso philosopher. See, for\nexample, JB, 18\/2\/13-14, 546, where the airy Desaguliers was 'desired to wait on the President and take his\ndirections'.\n152 Stephen Pumfrey\nconservative Augustan ideology to Locke in making his escape. The Society wished to\nencourage the mechanical arts whilst discouraging the mechanics themselves. In order to\nshow that 'Mechanics are improvable by others besides Tradesmen', Sprat observed that:\nTradesmen...chiefly labour for present livelihood, and therefore cannot defer their expectations\nso long, as is commonly requisit for the ripening of any new contrivance... Whereas the men of\nfreer lives, have all the contrary advantages. They do not approach those Trades as their dull, and\nunavoidable, and perpetual employments, but as their diversions.90\nAs with Locke's cutters and diggers, the manipulation of apparatus by mechanics and by\nmechanical philosophers might look physically identical, but they were morally different.\nConsequently, according to Sprat, the advancement of mechanics required 'the light of\nmen of Knowledge, to be a constant overseer, and director, of the industry, and works of\nthose that labour'. He mused over a future Solomon's House, 'when either Mechanick\nLaborers shall have Philosophical heads; or the Philosophers shall have Mechanical\nhands',91 but for Sprat, as perhaps for Locke, such men were futuristic mutants. Yet is not\na mutant, who adds to his mechanical hands a philosophical head, an excellent description\nof the science lecturer or public demonstrator of experiments ? As Sprat, Locke and other\nAugustans sensed but could not acknowledge, the monsters of professional experimental\nscience were already in their midst.\nSprat's and Locke's classical moral distinction explicitly permitted gentlemen to play at\nmechanics and at being mechanics. It is not argued that Augustan ideology prevented them\nfrom experimenting. This would fly in the face of the evidence, particularly from the\nSociety's first meetings. Virtuosi could choose to experiment in public, and also in their\nprivate laboratories.92 What the moral ideology did not permit was for them to do it\n'professionally'. Conversely, it ruled out the paid experimenter from the community of\nphilosophers.\nThe point is that, whatever the Fellows' rhetoric encouraged in principle, the practice of\nthe Society evolved to devolve the work to its paid servants. Many of the famous\nexperimental achievements of its 'Golden Age', such as the development of pneumatics,\nthe consolidation of Newton's mechanical and optical theory and the new science of\nelectricity, depended wholly on their labour and in no small part on their genius. Although\nthe rhetoric of experimentalism was created by gentleman philosophers, the practice was\nforged by their inferiors, to whom the ingredients of sustained labour, physical\nmanipulation, mechanical mindedness and 'intercourse with tradesmen' were closer to\nhand.\nThe new situation exposed the now familiar contradictions in the old ideology. Was a\npaid demonstrator like Hauksbee or, earlier, Hooke a servant of or an equal with his\npaymasters ? Was Desaguliers primarily a labouring hand or a philosophical head ? Did he\ndo experiments or experimental philosophy ? Did the rewards from these men's labour and\n90 T. Sprat, A History of the Royal Society, London, 1667 (reprint edn, London, 1959), 391-2, 404.\n91 Sprat, op. cit. (90), 397, 396, 427.\n92 It would, however, be instructive to re-examine the distribution of private experimental work. We need to\ndetermine the extent to which gentlemen acted as philosophical overseers of operators, whose contributions\nbecome invisible in the public reports.\nWho did the work? 153\nthe intellectual capital belong to them, to the Royal Society, or to the Republic of Letters ?\nThe questions were hard, and getting harder as paid professionals proliferated.\nThose questions, however, were by no means confined to experimental philosophy.\nThey reflected, in a very sharply focused way, problematic changes in relations of class and\nin the relations between reason, status and labour. What had already been in Hooke's time\ntense, unstable demarcations, broke down further as commercialization, including the\ncommercialization of science, continued the evolution of England's social structure. We\nmight conclude that the conversion of experimentalist rhetoric into entrenched social\npractice required such an evolution. In the history of science, the fossil records of the early\nRoyal Society begin with virtuoso curatorship. There follows an unstable period where a\nlower species is allowed to take over, and it concludes with the growth of a new habitat,\nwith fewer barriers to interbreeding. The habitat, which Larry Stewart has called 'public\nscience', is populated by lecturers-cum-philosophers-cum-demonstrators. The rise of\npublic, experimental science was intimately linked to the rise of commercial society but,\nby successfully negotiating the contradictions which were so evident in it, it also acted as\na spur to development.\nTHE CHANGING PLACE OF THE PAID PROFESSIONAL\nThis final section attends more closely to some consequences for the Royal Society of the\nco-evolution of professional science and commercial society. A major change was effected\nby the expanding structure of professional science. By 1730 the range of occupations\navailable within this area had broadened and differentiated into a recognizable professional\nhierarchy. The ladder afforded an ascent into the pseudo-gentry which had not existed in\nthe seventeenth century. With the increased numbers, and the improved levels of wealth\nand status for instrument makers, scientific lecturers and consultants, came increased social\nmobility and diversity. In consequence experimental curators and demonstrators could\nnow emerge from various social strata. No instrument maker was elected FRS in the\nseventeenth century, when even the excellent Joseph Moxon was blackballed. Restoration\nEngland had not developed the social dynamics that in the earliest years of the eighteenth\ncentury allowed a draper like Hauksbee and a dyer like Gray to offer professional scientific\nservices and to obtain formal equality with virtuosi. Contemporaries tried to distinguish\nbetween the likes of Hauksbee, Keill and Desaguliers, but with increasing difficulty. Each\nhad a claim to be doing genuine experimental philosophy. The new era of the science\nlecturer, in which public science came of age, ended the old era of the exclusively gentleman\nphilosopher, in which experimental science had been developed.\nSecondly, commercialization and professionalization eroded the early Society's apparent\nconcern to separate science as public duty from science as private profit. Sprat's distinction\nbetween interested 'tradesmen' and disinterested virtuosi, which Hooke was already, if\nuniquely blurring, became unworkable in the late Augustan climate. Meetings of the\nSociety came to combine readily fruits from philosophy with those from the business of\ncoffee-house entertainment or of technical consultancy. This was because a demonstrator\nlike Desaguliers moved freely between various domains, and transferred practices from one\nto the other as he sought to please the Fellows. Such transfers help to explain two\ncharacteristics of Augustan science.\n154 Stephen Pumfrey\nOne characteristic is the prominence of the lecturer's demonstration experiment.\nHauksbee's genius for producing apparatus which turned ephemeral and feeble phenomena\nsuch as phosphorescence and electricity into visible public spectacles was an essential\ncomponent of the Newtonian programme to explore the hidden active principles of nature.\nDesaguliers excelled at well-designed demonstration experiments which tested and\nremoved ambiguities, and this didactic skill fitted well with Newton's belief in\nincontrovertible experimental deductions. However, serious, pedagogic Newtonianism\ncould also shade into showmanship. Desaguliers, for example, interspersed important, but\ndull optical experiments with his 'Newton's cradle', a combination of demonstration and\ndisplay. He also showed experiments to imitate the feats of the circus 'strong man' with\na system of pulleys, an item doubtless taken from the top drawer of his crowd-pleasers. The\nFellowship, uniquely, desired them to be repeated.93\nA second characteristic was the intrusion of the world of projecting and technical\nconsultancy as the lecturers whom the Society employed brought their projects and\nschemes with them. Under Newton, the Society attempted to keep itself free from\ncommerce, but the pressure of the experimenters' financial interests produced incon-\nsistencies. A proposal from Papin, that they 'Erect a Company or Society for New\nInventions for which Subscriptions may be made for 1000 stock' (beginning with his\nDigester), from which he would get 10 per cent of profits, was dismissed.94 Yet the Society\nwas simultaneously negotiating the profitable right to scrutinize all patents.95 Similarly, it\nrejected requests for patronage and support from 'necessitous' engineers as improper,96\nwhile Desaguliers was allowed to announce a private show during a meeting, and\nadvertised his patent fireplace using as endorsement one he had installed at Crane Court.97\nAfter Newton's death, Desaguliers shifted the emphasis of his demonstrations towards the\ncommercial applications of Newtonian mechanics. Fellows understood the value of this,\nand the majority of subscribers to the second volume of Desagulier's Course of\nExperimental Philosophy insisted upon the replacement of Newtonian optics by 'the\nConsideration of Water-Engines'!98\nRobert Hooke would surely have envied such free play between the Society and a secure\ncommercial sector. He had been in constant dispute with the Society over benefits arising\nfrom his work, and worried about revealing his inventions to them. Curator Hooke had\naccepted exclusive employment - he had no alternatives in the 1660s - and he was brought\nto heel by the Society until the 1670s, when his fortunes improved and he could afford to\nignore its complaints. But in the eighteenth century, the Society recognized that, while\n93 JB, 10\/6\/14, 574; JB, 21\/7\/15, 78. Such experiments were accompanied with references to the principles\nwhich they demonstrated. In the following paper in this issue Schaffer suggests that these particular experiments\nrelated to claims for perpetual motion machines (see S. Schaffer,' The show that never ends: displays of perpetual\nmotion in the early eighteenth century', B)HS (1995), 28, 157-89).\n94 JB, 26\/4\/11, 278-9.\n95 See Stewart, op. cit.

First he asked for recommendations, which Fellows considered giving, but as individuals and not as from\nthe Society as a whole. He returned to offer his services, without result, and then appeared two years later pleading\nhis 'necessitous condition'. He was informed that the Society did not deal with such petitions.

The statutes, for which\nNewton was a stickler, specified that the Curators by Office could not engage 'in any other\nemployment'.99 Hauksbee and Desaguliers arrived already profiting from public lecturing\nand demonstrating. The statutes allowed for men, like them, 'engaged in other\nemployments [who] may yet be of usefulness to the Society'. Such men could not hold a\nCuratorship by Office, but only plain curatorships. They could not receive a salary, but\npayment 'proportionable to the time bestowed in service', a system which Hooke had\nadvocated in the 1670s and which was later implemented.100 Consequently, one of\nNewton's annual tasks at a summer meeting of Council was to decide how much work\nHauksbee or Desaguliers had done, and how much they deserved.101\nBy 1730 we can see the easing of some of the explicit tensions between natural\nphilosophical work and social status, and the creation of a more comfortable world for the\nlikes of Desaguliers. The old ideology linking labour, reason and status had become\ndysfunctional. More and more Englishmen were adopting the ideology of Desaguliers'\npatron, Richard Steele, and agreed that reason (albeit Locke's highly political notion of\nreason) counted for more than breeding.102 In this context, it made less sense to worry\nabout 'who did the work?'\nCONCLUSION: LECTURERS OR PHILOSOPHERS?\nDid these changes turn every experimental worker into a credible natural philosopher?\nWere even public lecturers 'all scientists now'? Some Tories continued to deny that\ncommodified philosophy was philosophy at all. I conclude, as I began, with the\ncontemporary assessments of Hauksbee.\nWhen Desaguliers wished to place himself above Hauksbee, he was in a position to\ninvoke neither considerations of birth and status, nor the impurity of trade. Instead, he\nrefused to dignify Hauksbee's work with the title of philosophy because it was not\n'rational' like his own. Because Hauksbee's experiments were 'not made use of as\nmediums to prove a series of philosophical propositions in a Mathematical Order, they laid\nno such foundation for true Philosophy as Dr. Keill's experiments'.103 Desaguliers could\nnot pretend that his work was untouched by commerce, but he chose to present the newly\ncommercialized profession of science lecturing as peculiarly above other trades and\nprofessions. He traded in reason - a market where, he claimed, the normal ungentlemanly\nrules did not apply.\n[Others'] Discoveries become an advantage to myself; for what would raise envy in any other\nprofession, but that of a Philosopher, is received as a new Acquisition by all Lovers of Natural\n99 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 13.\n100 Pumfrey, op. cit. (14), 8-10. The evidence of Hauksbee's and Desaguliers' employment and reward shows\nthat the system was adhered to in the eighteenth century.\n101 Newton did not pay them 'by results' (in Heilbron's understandably loose words), but according to the\nmodel of service.\n102 For Desaguliers and Steele, see Stewart, op. cit. (2), especially 265-7.\n103 Desaguliers, op. cit. (16), Preface, p. cv.\n156 Stephen Pumfrey\nKnowledge, the Profit being shared in common, while the Discoverer has only the Honour of the\nInvention... For this reason, I never scruple making use of Machines and Instruments contriv'd\nby others, nor was I ever shy of communicating, or even lending my own.104\nThis was nonsense. Ten years later, poorer and disillusioned, he complained that his\ninventions and profits had been stolen by the unscrupulous. As Stewart shows, Desaguliers\neventually found the commercial world tough going, but it was precisely to this world,\nwhere the distinction between civic virtue and common trade was disappearing, that he and\nthe other Georgian lecturers owed their existence and esteem.\nUnlike Desaguliers, when Hauksbee compiled his book of public experiments he did not\nclaim that he was a philosopher. In his preface, he portrayed himself as a man well aware\nthat he was unequal to the natural philosophers whom he served. His Physico-Mechanical\nExperiments present (as Desaguliers claimed of his lectures) a series of 'surprizing\nphenomena', produced by 'so undeserving a person' and one who was 'very sensible [of]\nthe imperfection of my performance and my want of a learned education'. The authority\nof the experiments came not from him, but from his masters - the work had ' been already\nread and approved before the Society', which he hoped would 'overcome the disadvantage\nof coming from the hands of so undeserving a person'.\nThe authorial voice of the descriptions is that of an uninformed observer who is,\ntherefore, constantly 'surprized'. Hauksbee ventured some comments in an appendix, but\ngenerally presented his experiments as the observations of an unlearned mechanic. They\n'will (I hope) be of some use to the Intelligent Philosophical Reader'.105 We could agree\nwith Hauksbee and apply to him, as he did to himself, the conventional, classical standards\nof Augustan England. If so, then he and his like may have done the experimental work, but\nthey were not experimental philosophers. We might say that he became one to later\ngenerations, more distant from, or blind to the status concerns of Hauksbee's age. During\nthe eighteenth century the rise of the science lecturer and of public science rendered those\nconcerns increasingly archaic and irrelevant in England. Many modern historians miss\nthem completely.\nIn Desmarest's Paris of the 1750s, where middle-class ferment against the ancien regime\nwas gathering pace, society was in important ways similar to Hauksbee's own. But the\nFrench academicians read Hauksbee's work in ignorance of the social circumstances of its\nproduction. Distanced from these, Desmarest could present Hauksbee as an exemplary\nnatural philosopher. But the academicians who promoted the image were either naive or\ndisingenuous. Desmarest was not prepared to believe that M. Hauksbee physicien could\n'abuse [his] trust by turning [his] machines into commercial objects'.106 Yet that is\nprecisely what Hauksbee and his fellow science lecturers did, and how, in Sprat's phrase,\nhe chiefly laboured for present livelihood. Had Desmarest known about the ignoble nature\nof the work Hauksbee did, he would surely have treated him no better than did the Royal\nSociety. Hauksbee was a classy experimenter, but other considerations of class mattered\nmore.\n104 Desaguliers, op. cit. (16), Preface, p. cv.\n105 Hauksbee, op. cit.
