There is significant interest in the potential for technology\nto reduce utilisation of health services in these patient populations, including telecare (the remote, automatic and\npassive monitoring of changes in an individual\u2019s condition or lifestyle) and telehealth (the remote exchange of data\nbetween a patient and health care professional).

While there are alternative propo-\nsals about the implications of increasing numbers of\nolder people on demand for services [2], much planning\nis predicated on expected increases in social and health\nservice use amongst older people. Shifting the balance\nof care towards the home environment is seen as requir-\ning an investment in \u2018upstream\u2019 interventions by provid-\ning enhanced primary and community care-based\nalternatives to secondary care and focusing on self-care\nat the patient level.\nThe role of technology\nIn the current context of economic pressures and a\ndesire to secure efficiency savings, there is significant\ninterest in the potential for technology to reduce utilisa-\ntion of health services in older people with long-term\nconditions and social care needs, while improving the\nquality and cost-effectiveness of care. There are a num-\nber of relevant types of telemonitoring technology and a\nlack of consensus concerning terminology.

Examples include\nmovement sensors, falls sensors, and bed\/chair occu-\npancy sensors. These technologies are generally pro-\nvided to patients with social care needs.\n\u2022 Telehealth is the remote exchange of data between\na patient and health care professional to assist in the\ndiagnosis and management of a health care condi-\ntion. Examples include blood pressure and blood\nglucose monitoring. These technologies are generally\nprovided to patients with long-term health condi-\ntions such as diabetes.\nIn the United Kingdom, the announcement of the\nWhole System Demonstrator pilots led to the subse-\nquent award of funding to teams in three areas of Eng-\nland (Kent, Newham and Cornwall) to implement\nservice redesign to support individuals with long-term\nand complex health and social care needs. This \u2018whole\nsystems redesign\u2019 was designed to create multidisciplin-\nary teams in health and social services and the develop-\nment of integrated care plans to deliver care more\neffectively to these patient populations. An important\npart of the \u2018whole systems redesign\u2019 was the introduc-\ntion of telemonitoring technology in the home to sup-\nport the provision of these new services and serve as an\n\u2018effect multiplier\u2019 for changes in service delivery (See\nFigure 1). The aim of the Whole System Demonstrator\ntrial is to evaluate whether telehealth for people with\nlong-term conditions and telecare for people with social\ncare needs can provide cost-effective care to improve\noutcomes, maintain independence, achieve significant\ngains in quality of life and reduce unnecessary acute\nhospital use and costs.\nEvidence for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of\ntelecare and telehealth\nSeveral reviews of the effectiveness of telecare and tele-\nhealth have been published both within specific disease\nareas [3-5] and across different areas [6,7]. Much of the\navailable literature refers to pilot projects and the assess-\nment of the impact of these devices on short-term out-\ncomes and the majority of studies do not meet robust\nevaluation standards. Very few of the studies reviewed\nhave assessed the longer-term or routine use of such\ntechnologies. A systematic review of 24 trials of interac-\ntive health communication applications [8] most closely\nrelate to what is defined here as telehealth. In the\nreview, telehealth had a significant positive effect on\nknowledge, social support, behavioural outcomes (e.g.\ncalorific intake, exercise and medication taking) and\nclinical outcomes (e.g. asthma symptoms, HbA1c levels\nand body mass index). It was not possible to determine\nwhether they had an effect on emotional outcomes or\noverall healthcare resource use. Another recent systema-\ntic review of telecare and telehealth interventions\nreported an emerging evidence base for the clinical\neffectiveness of telehealth technologies aimed at vital\nsigns monitoring but insufficient high quality evidence\nfor the effectiveness of telecare applications such as\nsafety and security monitoring [9].\nThe clear potential of telehealth and telecare technol-\nogy to improve care and reduce costs combined with\nthe lack of rigorous evidence of actual impact means\nthat a randomised controlled trial is required. The\nremainder of this paper will describe the protocol for\nthe evaluation of the Whole System Demonstrator pilots\nand the methodological issues raised in the evaluation.\nMethods\/Design\nThe broad research aim is to assess the effectiveness and\ncost-effectiveness of (a) telehealth in the management of\npatients with long-term health conditions, and (b) tele-\ncare in the management of patients with social care\nneeds. The proposed trial is a large scale, pragmatic\nhealth technology assessment trial, designed to rando-\nmise suitably large numbers of patients and assess the\nimpact of a broad class of telemonitoring technologies\nin the context of routine delivery of NHS care [10,11].\nAs with any pragmatic trial, the proposed design was a\ncompromise between methodological, ethical and policy\nissues. The optimal assessment of the cost-effectiveness\nof a new health technology is a randomised controlled\ntrial, and this was the initial basis for all design discus-\nsions. However, subsequent discussions with sites high-\nlighted the importance of designing a trial that had the\nFlexibility\nIntegration\nCo-ordination\nImproved outcomes\nWhole \nsystems \nredesign\nWhole \nsystems \nredesign\nFlexibility\nIntegration\nCo-ordination\nImproved outcomes\nTelecare and \ntelehealth\nFigure 1 Telecare and telehealth as an \u2018effect modifier\u2019 of\nwider system redesign.\nBower et al.

Although\nmany services provided to patients (especially those with\nsocial care needs) are delivered outside primary care,\ngeneral practices were used as the unit of allocation\nbecause they are stable organisations involved in the\ncare of all patients in each site.\nGeneral practices were randomised so that eligible\npatients within their populations would receive access to\none technology (i.e. either telehealth or telecare). Each\npractice would thus provide intervention participants for\none technology (e.g. telehealth) and control participants\nfor the other technology (e.g. telecare) or vice versa.\nThis ensured that equity of access existed at the level of\nthe practice population, and that no practice was asked\nto risk randomisation to a no-treatment control where\nall patients would be denied access.1\nClearly, the introduction of a complex suite of tele-\nmonitoring technologies and the associated service\nchanges raised more questions than could be answered\nwith a conventional trial alone, so that the proposed\ncluster trial was used as a structure, around which a\nwider evaluative process was designed in line with\ncurrent convention about the assessment of complex\ninterventions [12,13]. The broad evaluation structure is\noutlined in Figure 3, and the research questions listed\nbelow.\n\u2022 Theme 1: Service utilisation. Does the introduction\nof telehealth or telecare result in reduction of service\nutilisation and costs of care?\n\u2022 Theme 2: Clinical effectiveness.

The core measure of service utilisation in\nTheme 1 was use of hospital services, to support a busi-\nness care for the adoption of telemonitoring technolo-\ngies in the United Kingdom. Due to the large skew in\ndistribution of hospital use, a large sample of patients\nwere required (see sample size calculation below).\nTherefore, all patients who receive telecare or telehealth\nin the practices involved in the evaluation were to have\nroutine data on health and social care service extracted\nfrom existing data sources. This did not require the\nindividual patient assessments required for Themes 2\nand 3. Themes 2 and 3 used a subsample of patients\nwho were assessed using patient reported outcome mea-\nsures (PROMs) and health utilisation measures to pro-\nvide a more comprehensive assessment of clinical and\ncost-effectiveness. The design is shown in more detail in\nFigure 6.\nData collection for Theme 1 will be based on extrac-\ntion from existing operational information systems in a\nvariety of health and social care settings. This requires\nnot only the extraction of large population-based data\nsets, but also a method to link data using a pseudoano-\nnymised identifier which protects an individual\u2019s identify\nin accord with national guidance.\nPopulation\n(a) Patients with long-term health conditions\nThree clinical conditions were included in the study:\nheart failure; diabetes and COPD. In the interests of\nmaximising external validity in this pragmatic trial, elig-\nibility was not conferred on the basis of formal clinical\nassessment of disease severity (e.g. HbA1c, FEV1 % pre-\ndicted, brain natriuretic peptide test). Instead patients\nwere deemed eligible on the basis of either (i) their\ninclusion on the relevant Quality Outcomes Framework\n(QOF) register in primary care, (ii) a confirmed medical\ndiagnosis in primary or secondary care medical records\nas indicated by GP Read Codes or ICD-10 codes, or (iii)\nconfirmation of disease status by a local clinician (i.e.\nGP, community matron) or by their hospital consultant.\nPatients were not excluded on the basis of additional\nphysical co-morbidities.\n(b) Individuals with social care needs\nInclusion criteria were informed by the Department of\nHealth Fair Access to Care criteria, and included people\naged 18+ meeting one or more of the following criteria:\ncurrently in receipt of, or considered to have a need for\nnight sitting; receiving 10 or more hours per week of\nhome care; receiving 1 or more days per week of day\ncare; mobility difficulties; those who have had a fall or\nwho are considered at high risk of falling; a live-in or\nnearby carer facing difficulties carrying their current\nburden of responsibilities; or cognitive impairment\/con-\nfusion with live-in or nearby carer.\nCluster randomised trial \nService utilisation \n \n \nTheme 1 \n \nDoes the introduction \nof telehealth and\/or \ntelecare result in \nreduction of utilisation \nand costs of care? \nPatient outcomes \n \n \nTheme 2 \n \nDoes the introduction \nof telehealth and\/or \ntelecare result in \nimprovements in \npatient outcomes? \nCost effectiveness \n \n \nTheme 3 \n \nWhat are the \neconomic \nconsequences of \nintroducing telehealth \nand telecare? \nPatient and professional \nexperience  \n \nTheme 4 \n \nWhat are the \nexperiences of users, \ncarers and professionals \nto the introduction of \ntelehealth\/telecare? \nService delivery and \norganisation \n \nTheme 5 \n \nWhat organisational \nfactors facilitate or \nimpede the sustainable \nadoption and integration \nof telehealth\/telecare? \nWider Context of the Whole Systems Demonstration Sites \nFigure 3 Research Themes.\nBower et al.

Each site has sepa-\nrate agreements with technology suppliers and there is\nno attempt to standardise the exact technology across\nsites. The analysis plan does not propose to evaluate the\neffects of individual technologies and the study is not\npowered to do so.\n(a) Telehealth and telecare\nTelehealth participants in Cornwall and Kent received a\nhome monitoring system comprising a base unit (the\nTunstall RTX 3370 or the Viterion V100 respectively),\nwhich is a small device with an LCD screen and\nWhat are the experiences of service users, carers and health and social care professionals \nregarding the introduction and use of telehealth and telecare? \nThis qualitative evaluation is intended to complement as well as provide additional evidence to \nthe cluster randomised trial as recommended by the MRC Framework for evaluation of complex \ninterventions [47]. The main focus is to assess the impact of telehealth and telecare packages on \nthe views and experiences of patients and service users (including carers) and the interaction \nbetween service users, carers and professionals.  An additional focus is the professional \nperspective on the use and implementation of telecare and telehealth.   \nTheme 4 draws on two conceptual frameworks in the areas of telecare and self-management for \nlong-term conditions. Firstly, the normalization process model [48] has been developed from \nexisting evaluation studies of telecare interventions and has focused on how technologies come \nto be adapted and used (or factors involved in their failure) in routine care. Secondly, the WISE \n(Whole System Informing Self-management Engagement) model has been developed from mixed \nmethods research to investigate when patient-centred self-management is likely to be most \neffective [49]. \nAims \nx To explore patient and carer perspectives and experiences of existing services for \nchronic disease management \nx To explore patient and carer attitudes to and engagement with telehealth and telecare \nx To examine changes in management and care arrangements associated with \ninterventions including impact on caring relationships (informal as well as professional) \nand use of services and resources \nx To explore professional attitudes to and engagement with telehealth and telecare \nincluding perceptions of the costs and benefits and changes to working practices \nx To investigate reasons for refusal of technology and withdrawal from the trial \nMethods  \nA 2-year qualitative longitudinal study is being conducted using a multi-method approach: \nx Semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients, carers and professionals at multiple \ntime-points through the trial \nx Observation to document technology use within patients\u2019 homes in the context of other \nmanagement practices, caring relationships and interactions with professionals \nx Semi-structured in-depth interviews with patients and carers who declined to take part in \nthe trial following eligibility assessment \nSampling \nIn recruiting patients and carers entering the trial, a purposeful maximum variation sampling \nstrategy is being used to select people from across the different sites to include a range of long-\nterm conditions, ages, socioeconomic status, locale, gender and illness severity. Health and \nsocial care staff involved in the care of people within the trial are being recruited, ensuring a \nmixture of grades of staff with various roles across all 3 sites. An opportunistic sample of patients \nwho do not enter the trial following initial eligibility assessment are also invited to be interviewed \nto discuss their views about telehealth and telecare and their past and current care.       \nFigure 4 Theme 4.\nBower et al.

In the longer term, its \nwidespread diffusion will require not just a policy mandate but also a better understanding of the \nfactors that ensure successful and sustainable local implementation. Health service innovation is \nnot linear or orderly [50,51] and technological innovation requires both individual and \norganisational change [52]. Policy support may increase an organisation\u2019s predisposition, but not \nits capacity, to adopt an innovation [53]. Research on the adoption of telemedicine [54] and \ntelecare [55,56] and systematic reviews on telemedicine implementation success factors [57] \npoint to the need for support from local \u2018sponsors\u2019 and coalition building across stakeholders.  \n \nAims \n \nTheme 5 is exploring the challenges in scaling up from the Whole System Demonstrator trials to \nadopt and diffuse telehealth and telecare on a mainstream basis. It is assessing the \nimplementation process across the range of stakeholders involved in planning, delivering, \noperating and embedding these technologies, and highlighting the lessons learnt for improving \nthe future implementation of telehealth and telecare in the UK.  \n \nThis study involves a qualitative analysis of organisational and contextual factors in the \nimplementation of telehealth and telecare within the three sites. The emphasis is on the decisions \ntaken by local stakeholders, including the equipment supply chain, and their impact on the \nimplementation outcomes. The role of strategic policy and operational decisions and targets, and \nrelationships between organizations and between professional groups are likely to be of particular \nimportance. The impact of the boundaries on local implementation practice set by the evaluation \nitself are also likely to be of importance.    \n   \nMethods \n \nAn in-depth, comparative, longitudinal analysis of implementation within the 3 sites, focusing both \non processes and outcomes [58,59] is being conducted. The case study method is useful where \nthe range of issues is wide, the concepts are related in complex ways [60] and context is \nimportant [61].   \n \nQualitative data is being collected through semi-structured interviews with representatives from \nkey stakeholders involved in the sites (e.g. local social service and housing authorities, primary \/ \nacute care trusts, private sector equipment suppliers and installers) from \u2018set-up\u2019 to the \n\u2018completion\u2019 phase . The sample has been selected purposively to include appropriate \nstakeholders and to include a range of experiences.  \n \nTo situate the research within the context of telehealth and telecare adoption in the UK, we are \nreviewing relevant literature and monitoring policy and organisational developments. This \ninvolves regular access to websites, meeting with key local and national personnel, attending \nconferences, and monitoring of new research. Findings will be used to inform policy and develop \na conceptual framework about telehealth and telecare implementation that takes into account the \ninteraction between context, mechanism and outcome.  \n \nParallel to the Whole System Demonstrator programme, we are exploring the process of \nimplementation and progress made in remote care services in 6 sites that are not part of the trial. \nStudying sites that are and are not constrained by conditions in a trial will shed light upon context-\nspecific and generic factors influencing the implementation of these services and their likelihood \nof  sustainability in the absence of external support. Matched semi-structured interviews with \nstakeholders in 3 Whole System Demonstrator sites outside the trial (Lincolnshire, Croydon, \nNorfolk) and 3 other non-Whole System Demonstrator sites (Surrey, Durham, Sandwell) have \nbeen carried out. The findings from this study are helping us understand how different \nmanagement structures and contexts impact on implementation \nFigure 5 Theme 5.\nBower et al.

Sites used different protocols\nfor allocating peripheral devices but across all sites the\ncritical devices by condition were a pulse oximeter (for\nCOPD), a glucometer (for diabetes) and weighing scales\n(for heart failure). Participants with multiple conditions\nreceived multiple peripheral devices. Participants were\nasked to take clinical readings up to 5 days per week at\nthe same time each day but the frequency was adjusted\naccording to their individual history (e.g. a participant\nwith diabetes and well controlled blood glucose would\nbe asked to take readings less frequently than one with\npoorly controlled blood glucose). In Cornwall and New-\nham the base unit or set top box provided a visual and\naudio reminder when readings were due. At the end of\neach session data from clinical readings and symptom\nquestions were sent to a monitoring centre via a secure\nserver either automatically (in Cornwall and Newham)\nor following participant authorisation (in Kent).\nAcross all sites, telecare participants received a Tun-\nstall Lifeline Connect or Connect+ base unit and pen-\ndant alarm together with any number of 27 peripheral\ndevices classified into four broad categories: personal\nhealth and well-being sensors (e.g. bed\/chair occupancy\nsensors, enuresis sensor, epilepsy sensor, fall detector,\nmedication dispenser), sensory impairment aids (e.g. big\nbutton telephone, wearable vibrating alert), safety and\nsecurity aids (e.g. bogus caller button, key safe) and\nenvironmental monitoring sensors (e.g. carbon monox-\nide detector, heat sensor, flood detector). Peripheral tel-\necare devices were allocated on the basis of a needs\nassessment and participants with multiple needs were\nallocated appropriate combinations of peripheral devices.\nTelecare is primarily a passive system to monitor beha-\nviour (via sensors around the home), facilitate indepen-\ndent living (via aids for memory, safety and sensory\nimpairment) and raise alarms either automatically (via\nsensors) or manually (via a personal alarm or pull cord)\nin the event of an emergency. As such there was no\nrequired behavioural regimen that telecare intervention\nparticipants were expected to adhere to (i.e. they were\nnot expected to take any clinical readings or answer\nsymptom questions on a regular basis via the base unit\nor set top box). Data from sensors and alarms were\nautomatically sent to a monitoring centre via a tele-\nphone line.\nMonitoring centres were staffed by specialist nurses\nand community matrons. Incoming telehealth readings\nwere automatically classified using a traffic light system\nof red, amber or green alerts based on relevant NICE\nguidelines or on individually tailored criteria specified\nby clinicians familiar with the case history. Red alerts in\ntelehealth usually represent an opportunity for early\nintervention to prevent or minimise imminent clinical\ndeterioration (e.g. titration of medications in response to\na sudden weight change in heart failure may prevent\nRandomisation \nGroup 2 practices Group 1 practices \nRoutine data \nonly, all \npatients \nPrimary data \ncollection, \nsubsample of \npatients \nRoutine data \nonly, all \npatients \n \nPrimary data \ncollection, \nsubsample of \npatients \nBaseline \n3 months \n \n \nRoutine data \ncollected \nover 12 \nmonth period \n \n \n \n \nTheme 1 \n \nPatients with social \ncare needs receive \ntelecare \nPatients with \nCOPD, diabetes \nand HF receive \nusual care \nPatients with social \ncare needs receive \nusual care \n \nPatients with \nCOPD, diabetes \nand HF receive \ntelehealth \nRoutine data \nonly, all \npatients \n \nPrimary data \ncollection, \nsubsample of \npatients \nRoutine data \nonly, all \npatients \n \nPrimary data \ncollection, \nsubsample of \npatients \n12 months  \nTheme 2\/3 \nBaseline Baseline Baseline \n3 months 3 months 3 months \n12 months \nTheme 2\/3 \n12 months \nTheme 2\/3 \n12 months \nTheme 2\/3 \n \n \nRoutine data \ncollected \nover 12 \nmonth period \n \n \n \n \nTheme 1 \n \n \n \nRoutine data \ncollected \nover 12 \nmonth period \n \n \n \n \nTheme 1 \n \n \n \nRoutine data \ncollected \nover 12 \nmonth period \n \n \n \n \nTheme 1 \n \nFigure 6 Detailed study design.\nBower et al.

Incoming\ndata from certain telecare sensors (e.g. fall detector, heat\nsensor, smoke alarm) generated a red flag if outside set\nparameters to indicate a potential emergency situation\nrequiring an immediate response. Other telecare sensors\n(e.g. bed\/chair occupancy sensors) generated more\nambiguous information and usually required contact\nwith the user to establish their status. Telehealth alerts\nwere typically monitored during office hours on a daily\nbasis (Monday to Friday), while telecare alerts were\nmonitored 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Moni-\ntoring centre staff provided a stepped-care response to\nalerts ranging from reviewing recent clinical readings\nbut taking no further action or requesting a repeat read-\ning (these responses are for telehealth only) through to\ncontacting the participant via the base unit or telephone,\nvisiting the participant or referring on to another health-\ncare professional (e.g. GP, secondary care services or\nemergency services).\n(b) Waiting list controls\nTelehealth and telecare participants randomised to the\ncontrol arm received standard health and social care for\n12-months and then, subject to re-assessment, were\noffered telehealth or telecare at the end of trial.\nOutcomes\nTheme 1 will collect and link large, administrative data-\nsets with the aim of tracking service use for (a) up to\nthree years pre-intervention and (b) 12 months post-\nintervention. It will include an assessment of hospital\nutilisation, including emergency and elective inpatient\nadmissions, inpatient bed day use, outpatient atten-\ndances and accident and emergency visits; primary care\nutilisation, including GP encounters, prescription drugs\nand community matron visits; and, if possible, social\ncare utilisation such as the use of domiciliary and resi-\ndential care. Costs will be attributed to activity using\nnational Payment by Results tariffs and reference costs.\nTheme 2 and 3 include a comprehensive assessment\nof PROMs and health utilisation measures at 3 and 12\nmonths, including general quality of life [14-16], dis-\nease-specific quality of life (teleheath only) [17-19], psy-\nchological well being [20,21], perceived acceptability of\ntelemonitoring devices; use of telehealth and telecare;\nattitudes, self-efficacy and self-care behaviours [22-25],\nclinical outcomes (for telehealth participants), social net-\nworks [26], illness burden [27], disability [28,29] and\nhealth care and social services utilisation [30,31]. Carer\noutcomes include carer anxiety and caregiver strain\n[32,33], and carer costs include carer time spent in pro-\nviding care to the participant as well as lost productivity.\nThe full range of assessment instruments is provided\nonline (Additional file 1).\nSample size calculation\n(a) Sample size calculation for Theme 1\nThe primary outcome measure was taken as the propor-\ntion admitted to hospital, with the secondary outcome\nmeasure being number of bed days. It was thought\nimportant to be able to detect a relative change in\nadmission proportion of between 15% and 20%, from a\nbaseline of 25% (estimated from actual site data), and a\nchange in bed day use of 20%, both at power of 80%\nand two-sided p-value of < 0.05. Previous studies in the\nolder population suggested that the intra cluster correla-\ntion (ICC) for admissions would be around 0.001 [34].\nSample size calculations were carried out using appro-\npriate formulae [35] and suggested that a sample of\n3,000 patients would allow the detection of a relative\nrisk reduction (RRR) of 17.5% in admission proportion\nand a 20% reduction in bed days using the above cri-\nteria. Given that two separate RCTs of telehealth and\ntelecare were being run, this means that the overall tar-\nget sample size for Theme 1 was 6,000 patients.\n(b) Sample size calculation for Theme 2 and 3\nThe sample size requirements were calculated in rela-\ntion to COPD using the most plausible condition-speci-\nfic health related quality of life measure: the Chronic\nRespiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and its key dimension\n(the dyspnoea scale). Baseline mean scores were esti-\nmated at between 2.3 and 3.3 with a standard deviation\nof 1.0 [36]. Taking the minimal clinical important differ-\nence (MCID) at a conservative 0.3 [37], the effect size\n(given the observed baseline SD of 1.0) would be 0.3.\nSince ICC values of around 0.03 for both morbidity [38]\nand health related quality of life [39] variables have been\nreported, the ICC was estimated at 0.01 and 0.05. With\npower of 80% and two-sided p-value of < 0.05, the\nrequired sample size would be between 200 and 300 per\ncondition (i.e. an overall sample size of 900), assuming\nthe effect size for the health related quality of life mea-\nsures is around the same level of 0.3 for the other\nconditions.\nTrial procedures\nGeneral practices were approached by letter inviting\nthem to take part in the trial. Once a practice had con-\nsented, potential participants for telehealth were identi-\nfied in each site using existing registers of patients with\nlong-term conditions in general practice. Potential parti-\ncipants for telecare in each practice were identified from\ndatabases held by social services departments.\nTo meet ethical obligations, patients were asked to\ncomplete and return a \u2018data sharing letter\u2019 if they con-\nsented to their data being shared with the research\nteam. Once this letter was received, patients received a\n\u2018light touch\u2019 visit from a member of the project team in\neach site, where consent was taken to (a) participate in\nBower et al. BMC Health Services Research 2011, 11:184\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/11\/184\nPage 8 of 12\nthe main trial (Theme 1) and (b) the questionnaire study\n(Themes 2 and 3).\nParticipants who agreed to take part in the Themes 2\nand 3 were subsequently contacted by a market research\ncompany to arrange a convenient time for the baseline\ninterview. At this interview, patients received informa-\ntion about this part of the study and signed consent.\nThe baseline assessment varied by participant status (i.e.\nCOPD, heart failure, diabetes, telecare, carers) but each\ncomprised a core of standardised PROMs. The PROMs\nwere self-completed by the participant with the\nresearcher on hand to explain or clarify. Data on health\ncare utilisation were collected via interview. The average\ntotal time for assisted baseline interview completion was\n80 minutes.\nCarers of service users in the trial were identified by\nsites usually at the \u2018light touch\u2019 visit, either by the carer\nexpressing an interest or via snowball sampling (i.e. ask-\ning participants if they had an informal carer at the\nbaseline interview).\nEach practice was allocated to groups via a centrally\nadministered minimisation algorithm. The allocation\ndetermined the technologies available to each practice (i.\ne. either telehealth or telecare) and their associated\npatients. Following installation of the technologies, parti-\ncipants will be followed-up for 12-months. After 12-\nmonths, the \u2018usual care\u2019 groups were eligible to receive\nthe appropriate interventions.\nAnalysis\nThe overall trial essentially involves two nested trials\n(one comparing telehealth with usual care, and one\ncomparing telecare with usual care) which will be ana-\nlysed separately but using identical procedures.\nUnlike other evaluations of technologies in the NHS\n[40], the trial is not primarily designed to assess the\neffectiveness of any particular type of telecare or tele-\nhealth technology, and the primary analysis is at the\nlevel of the technology type (i.e. telehealth or telecare).\nThere are no plans to conduct analyses of individual\ntechnologies.\n(a) Themes 1 and 3\nBaseline characteristics (e.g. age; sex; ethnicity; co-mor-\nbidities; risk of hospitalisation; typical hospital use) of\nthe patients in the intervention and usual care arms will\nbe compared and adjusted for where appropriate. Utili-\nsation (inpatient admissions, bed day use, and cost) will\nbe compared between the two groups for the three\nyears before each patient receives the intervention, and\nthe 12 months afterwards using appropriate statistical\nmodels for cluster randomised trials.\nOne method of analysing the results of Theme 1 will\nbe using a risk stratification tool, to identify individuals\nat different levels of risk of future hospitalisation. Two\nsuch tools will be used, the Patients At Risk of Rehospi-\ntalisation (PARR) model and the Combined Predictive\nModel.2 Both of these models are in use in the NHS to\ncase-find patients for admission-avoidance programmes.\nThe aim will be to understand which patients saw great-\nest changes in service use from the addition of tele-\nhealth or telecare, according to standard metrics used\nroutinely to target services in parts of the NHS.\nData on health, social care and other support service\nuse for participants will be collected using the CSRI\n[30]. Unit costs will be attached to service use data to\ncalculate a total cost per patient at baseline, 3 months\nand 12 month follow up. Costs will be calculated on the\nbasis of the costs incurred in the 3 months prior to the\n3 data collection points. Service use and associated costs\nfor participants in both trial arms will be reported under\nsub-categories such as use of acute hospital services and\ncommunity social services. All cost categories will be\nallocated to a perspective (whether NHS, Local author-\nity, NHS and Local authority, or public sector). The\ncosts of the intervention will be calculated specifically\nfor this study from data provided by the sites and those\ncosts attached to participants receiving the intervention\nin the telehealth and telecare groups. Point estimates of\nthe costs for the control and intervention groups in\neach trial arm will be derived from univariate and multi-\nvariate analyses of costs from all 4 perspectives.\nThe effectiveness of the telehealth and telecare pro-\ngrammes will be compared using a common unit of out-\ncome measurement, the QALY, to be constructed from\nthe EQ-5D health state classification [16] scored using\nestablished algorithms (York Tariff) [41]. QALY scores\nwill be calculated for the baseline, 3 month and 12\nmonth follow-up points. In addition, scores from a\nbroader measure of quality of life intended for health\nand social care evaluations, the ICECAP [14], will be\nexamined. ICECAP scores at each time point will be\npresented for all three time points. Incremental cost\neffectiveness ratios (ICER) will be calculated at the 3\nmonth and 12 month follow up points for both trial\narms. The ICER will be defined as the difference in\nmean costs incurred by the treatment groups in each\narm over the previous 3 month period, divided by the\ndifference in mean QALY gain between those treatment\ngroups. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC)\nwill be produced, based on the results of a model of net\nmonetary benefit for clustered data. The CEAC allows\nthe decision-maker to see what is the likelihood of tele-\nhealth and telecare being cost-effective at different\nmonetary values of increments of improvement in the\nchosen outcome.\n(b) Theme 2\nClinical effectiveness (quality of life, well-being, self-care,\nand carer burden) at 3 and 12 months will be compared\nBower et al. BMC Health Services Research 2011, 11:184\nhttp:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1472-6963\/11\/184\nPage 9 of 12\nbetween the groups, taking into account scores at base-\nline, and adjusting for potential confounders where\nappropriate, using statistical models suitable for cluster\nrandomised trials.\nThe telehealth trial involves three separate clinical\npopulations, and we will assess the differential impact of\ntelehealth in these different clinical populations using a\npre-specified subgroup analysis across conditions\n(including a group with co-morbidities).\nDiscussion\nThe proposed study is an ambitious project that is\ndesigned to provide a pragmatic yet rigorous assessment\nof the benefits of (a) telehealth in the management of\npatients with long-term health conditions, and (b) tele-\ncare in the management of patients with social care\nneeds. Figure 7 shows the CONSORT diagram for the\nrecruitment to the trial which shows that 97% of the\npatient sample size target has been achieved.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of the proposed design\nAdoption of the cluster design means that individual\npatients are not randomised to technology or usual care.\nThis overcomes concerns raised by the participating\nsites, who felt that individual randomisation was unlikely\nto be acceptable to patients or professionals: in the\nadopted design, all general practices will have immediate\naccess to the roll-out of telemonitoring equipment for at\nleast some of their patients. The design thus overcomes\nconcerns about resentful demoralisation among prac-\ntices [42] if some practices had been randomised to\nusual care for all their patients, especially as all partici-\npants are assessed for the technology after 12 months.\nThe current study is a cluster randomised design, using\ngeneral practices as the unit of randomisation. However,\nthe present design is an \u2018individual cluster\u2019 design [43].\nThis means that a cluster randomised design has been\nadopted for various reasons, but the intervention is still\ndelivered to individual patients. This is unlike a \u2018cluster\ncluster\u2019 design, where patients in the cluster cannot\nrefuse the intervention (e.g. a water fluoridation trial).\nClearly, the planned analysis by type of technology\n(telehealth and telecare) ignores differences within tech-\nnologies. The study has not been powered to explore\nthe effects of individual technologies, but combining dif-\nferent technologies into the primary analysis will lead to\ndebates about their comparability [44]. The qualitative\ndata from Theme 4 may be a useful source of data on\nvariation among users and professionals in their experi-\nence of different technologies.\nIt is important to note that all practices taking part in\nthe evaluation are part of the Whole System Demonstra-\ntor pilots, and thus all practices and patients are poten-\ntially benefiting from the wider service redesign that is\nongoing in these sites. Therefore, the study is assessing\nthe added value of telehealth and telecare technologies\nover and above the effects of this wider service redesign,\nand not the benefits of whole systems redesign versus\nconventional care (see Figure 1). There will therefore be\nissues concerning the generalisability of the results,\nbecause the sites which are part of the Whole System\nDemonstrator pilots have been specifically chosen for\ntheir innovations in these areas of care.\nThe themes address related issues using a range of\nmethods. For example, Theme 1 exploits large, existing\nsources of administrative data on service use while\nTheme 3 collects self-reported data from patients. Sev-\neral studies have compared health care utilization as\ndescribed in administrative and self-reported data\n[45,46]. These have typically found significant differ-\nences, especially for people with high levels of use, older\npeople, and for people with poor health status. The trial\nis also novel in the ways that it exploits data linkage\nacross a range of operational data sets. The advantages\nof this approach are that it allows the team to access\nlarge volumes of computerised data relatively cheaply.\nThis enables analyses of much larger groups but also\nincludes historical data which can be used for risk\nadjustment and sub-group analyses. The disadvantages\nare that the data in administrative systems may be of\npoor quality and it may not capture the most important\nvariables. The combination of administrative data\n(Theme 1), and directly recorded patient events (Theme\n3) provide an opportunity to test whether data problems\ncreate different results.\nThe potential of telehealth and telecare technology to\nimprove care and reduce costs is limited by a lack of\nrigorous evidence of actual impact. If telehealth and tel-\necare technology proves cost-effective in our trial, it will\nprovide additional options for health services worldwide\nto deliver care for populations with high levels of need.\nEndnotes\n1 Originally a different design was planned.
