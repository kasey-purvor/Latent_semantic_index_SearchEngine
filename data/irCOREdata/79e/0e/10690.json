Because the effects on muscles and bones in the\nlower extremity during space flight are very similar1,2, bed\nrest is accepted as a ground-based model for it. The latter\nsuggests also that the main cause of the bone loss observed\nduring space flight is immobilization and not weightlessness\nper se.\nObviously, such bed rest studies provide a chance to study\nthe specific effects of immobilization, without interference\nof other diseases. In that sense, and also because the countermeasures\nthat the Space Agencies have started to develop\nmay be efficient in the near future, bed rest studies may also\nbe of interest for clinical medicine. So far, two types of countermeasures\nhave been considered. Resistance exercise is\nthought to preserve the leg musculature, and hopefully it\nthus will conserve the bones. Secondly, bisphosphonates as a\npotent inhibitor to bone resorption should be considered as\na possible countermeasure.<\/dc:description><dc:description>Full-text of this article is available at http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/14\/09RITTWEGER.pdf<\/dc:description><dc:publisher>The International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions<\/dc:publisher><dc:date>2010-04-28T13:48:53Z<\/dc:date><dc:type>Article<\/dc:type><dc:identifier>The Journal of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions, 2003, vol. 3, no. 4, pp. 290-291<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>15758301<\/dc:identifier><dc:identifier>http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/2173\/97574<\/dc:identifier><dc:language>en<\/dc:language><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/index.htm<\/dc:relation><dc:relation>http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/14\/09RITTWEGER.pdf<\/dc:relation><\/oai_dc:dc><\/metadata><\/record>","journals":null,"language":{"code":"en","id":9,"name":"English"},"relations":["http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/index.htm","http:\/\/www.ismni.org\/jmni\/pdf\/14\/09RITTWEGER.pdf"],"year":2010,"topics":[],"subject":["Article"],"fullText":""}
