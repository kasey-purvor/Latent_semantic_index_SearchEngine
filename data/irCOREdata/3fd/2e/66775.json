The result is a world of nested or \njostling territorial configurations, of territorial attack and defense, of scalar differences, of \ncontainer spaces.  The continuing grip of this imaginary is odd because it has been \nchallenged by two significant developments in recent years.   \n \nThe first challenge is the rise of compositional forces that are transforming cities and \nregions into sites immersed in global networks of organization and routinely implicated \nin distant connections and influences.  These are changes we have come to associate with \nglobalization, which includes the everyday transnational flow of ideas, information, \nknowledge, money, people, and cultural influences; the growth of translocal networks of \norganization and influence, such as transnational corporations, global financial \ninstitutions, international governance regimes, and transnational cultural networks; and \nthe ripples of distant developments such as stock market swings, environmental disasters, \nglobal trade agreements, and policy decisions in powerful nations.   \n \nThere is a large body of literature highlighting the variegated processes of spatial \nstretching and territorial perforation associated with globalization, which add up to the \ndisplacement of a world order of nested territorial formations composed of a discernible \n 1\ninside and outside, by a world of heterogeneous spatial arrangements in terms of \ngeographical shape, reach, influence and duration.  In this emerging new order, spatial \nconfigurations and spatial boundaries are no longer necessarily or purposively territorial \nor scalar, since the social, economic, political, and cultural inside and outside are \nconstituted through the topologies of actor networks which are becoming increasingly \ndynamic and varied in spatial constitution (Amin, 2002).   \n \nThe resulting excess of spatial composition is truly staggering.  It includes radiations of \ntelecommunications and transport networks around (and also under and above) the world, \nwhich in some places, fail to even link up proximate neighbours (Graham, 2002).  It \nincludes faith communities, dreamworlds and cultural domains that cut across lines of \nlongitude and latitude and in such complex ways that any attempt to trace the connections \nfrom a given location would look like a mess of squiggles across a map (Nederveen \nPieterse, 2003).  It includes supply chains and corporate networks that tie producers, \nintermediaries and consumers in the most unexpected places in highly structured and \nclose patterns of mutuality and dependence (Dicken, 2003; Hughes and Reimmer, 2004).  \nIt includes well-trodden but not always visible tracks of transnational escape, migration, \ntourism, business travel, asylum, and organized terror which dissect through, and lock, \nestablished communities into new circuits of belonging and attachment, resentment and \nfear (Castles and Miller, 1998; Coleman and Crang, 2002, Gray, 2003).  It includes all the \ntranshuman networks of sacred, viroid, digital, animal and plant life that summon \nmeaning and attachment at microcosmic, bodily, aerial, epidemiological, planetary and \ncosmological scales, and which thoroughly infuse life at any given site (Whatmore, \n2002).  It includes spaces of emotional attachment whose geographies are almost as \nvaried as life on earth, ranging from the workings of home, family and the playground, to \nthe long cultural networks that feed the screen and the musical arrangements etched on \nCDs (as Nigel Thrift reveals in his essay here).  It includes political registers that now far \nexceed the traditional sites of community, town hall, parliament, state and nation, spilling \nover into the machinery of virtual public spheres, international organizations, global \nsocial movements, diaspora politics, and planetary or cosmopolitan projects (Hardt and \nNegri, 2000; Connolly, 2002).  The list could continue, but the point can be made.  These \n 2\nspatialities are decisive in the constitution of the local, but they continue to be written out \nof the hegemonic territorial imaginary of the world. \n \nThis omission is all the more puzzling because there has existed for a while now a \nrelational reading of place that works with the ontology of flow, connectivity and \nmultiple geographical expression, to imagine the geography of cities and regions through \ntheir plural spatial connections.  This is the second reason why it is odd that the \nterritorial\/scalar imaginary of place has not budged.  Perhaps it is not that strange, given \nthe enduring grip of territorial representations of cities and regions.  It will take a lot to \ndisplace the A-Z or concentric-circle image of London by a \u2018relational\u2019 map that \nincorporates the network of sites around the world that pump fresh food into a \ndistribution centre called Covent Garden, that draws neighbourhood boundaries around \nsettlements in post-colonial countries with which social and kinship ties remain strong, \nthat makes us see sites such as Heathrow airport or Kings Cross station as radiations of \ntrails shooting out across the land and far beyond to reveal London a site of transit and \nconnectivity.  I cite London only because it came to mind first, not because it is any more \nrelationally constituted than any other place.  Similar imaginaries could be conjured up \nfor the least likely places, such as Bedouin camps in the Sahara brought to life through \nelaborate trading routes and religious practices that stretch across North Africa and far \nacross the ocean to market stalls in New York (Stoller, 2002). \n \nWithin geography, Doreen Massey and her colleagues at the Open University have been \nformative in developing a relational sense of place and space, supported by a rich vein of \nphilosophical inquiry into why we must take space also to mean dwelling, affinity, \nimmanence, relationality, multiplicity, and performativity (see also Thrift, 1999).  They \nhave imagined all kinds of ways in which our understanding of the spatiality of cities can \nbe enriched.  The bare essential of this theoretical endeavour are summarized in Massey\u2019s \nintroductory essay.  The resulting visualization of cities and regions makes interesting \nreading.  Now they are recast as nodes that gather flow and juxtapose diversity, as places \nof overlapping - but not necessarily locally connected \u2013 relational networks, as perforated \nentities with connections that stretch far in time and space, and, resulting from all of this, \n 3\nas spatial formations of continuously changing composition, character, and reach (Amin \nand Thrift, 2002).  Seen in this way, cities and regions come with no automatic promise \nof territorial or systemic integrity, since they are made through the spatiality of flow, \njuxtaposition, porosity, and relational connectivity.  The analytical challenge posed is to \nmake something of the tracings of varying length and duration of material, virtual and \nimmanent relationships that work through a place called London or a Bedouin camp, that \nmesh with a genealogy of past spatial relationships, to nudge London and the Bedouin \ncamp in new directions of force and expression.  So, if we are to see cities and regions as \nspatial formations, they must be summoned up as temporary placements of ever moving \nmaterial and immanent geographies, as \u2018hauntings\u2019 of things that have moved on but left \ntheir mark (as Thrift, 1999, puts it), as situated moments in distanciated networks, as \ncontoured products of the networks that cross a given place.  The sum is cities and \nregions without prescribed or proscribed boundaries. \n \nWhat\u2019s in such a war of imaginaries?  Why does it matter whether cities and regions are \nterritorially or relationally interpreted?  My argument in this paper is that the differences \nmatter politically in quite profound ways, because I believe that very different \nsensibilities of the political spring out of the two readings of place.  These differences \nrelate not only to the scope and reach of local political activity, but also to what is taken \nto count as being political at the local level.  Thus my aim in part is to open up an \nexpanded understanding of what it is to be political in the context of what counts as local \nmobilisation, echoing Nigel Thrift\u2019s attempt in this collection to interpret affect as \npolitical.  I want to pursue this dual aim through a discussion of the politics of \nregionalism.  Regionalism is certainly live in Britain, fuelled by significant moves \ntowards regional government and regional development agencies, and it is also part of a \nmajor reconfiguration of territorial politics elsewhere in Europe, driven by a reaction \nagainst the demons of state centrism, big nation, or modernist universalism.   \n \nThe Politics of Territoriality: The New Regionalism \n \n 4\nThere are many different models of contemporary regionalism in Europe, from the \ngovernance-driven devolution experiments in Britain, Poland and Hungary, to the ethno-\nnationalist regionalisms such as those in Northern Italy and in some former state socialist \ncountries, and the demands of autonomist movements and struggles of \u2018indigenous\u2019 \npeoples (Keating, 1998; Keating et al, 2003).  It is risky to assume a unitary regionalism \nwith a unitary politics.  I wish to claim, however, that underlying the very different \nnormative registers of regionalism - from febrile localism to secular republicanism and an \ninternationalist regionalism - there is common ground, based on the assumption that \nterritorial autonomy will: a) restore local control and democracy; b) increase economic \nreturns; and c) strengthen sense of attachment.  What I wish to argue is that all three \nexpectations spring from a strongly territorial imaginary of place and place politics, one \nthat is radically at odds with the implications that follow from a relational reading of \nplace.   \n \nOne good example is provided by the English experience, dominated as it has been by \nplans for regional assemblies and development agencies, claims of returning decision-\nmaking to local people, and a strong rhetoric of recovering and protecting old regional \nidentities, as Doreen Massey, Nigel Thrift and I have found in our recent work on the \nspatial grammar of British politics (Amin, Massey and Thrift, 2003).  We have argued \nthat these moves work with a highly restricted sense of local democracy, misunderstand \nthe spatial needs of the contemporary economy (which are increasingly spatially \ndistributed), and play on a conservationist regional identity that can be profoundly closed \nand exclusionary.   \n \nOther experiments are of course different.  So, for example, Scottish nationalists have \nexplicitly sought to reject a sense of place based on cultural parochialism, in support of a \nsense of Scottishness based on multiculturalism and cosmopolitan values, even though \ntheir governance and economic arguments for devolution have been similar.   Regionalist \nmobilization in Upper Silesia in Poland has been an impassioned plea for cultural \nrecognition against a history of state repression but also (as in other post-communist \ncontexts \u2013 see Batt and Wolczuk, 2002) a means for articulating regional identity and \n 5\nregional economy into a uniting Europe (Bialasiewicz, 2002).   The Northern Italian case \n\u2013 perhaps one of the most vocal regionalist claims in today\u2019s Europe \u2013 is not significantly \ndifferent. Certainly, the Lega Nord\u2019s recent rhetoric has become strongly exclusionary if \nnot explicitly xenophobic. But here, too, narratives of cultural-territorial difference serve \nas a foil for economic power. Whatever its supporters may claim, \u201cPadania\u201d is \nconstituted by its (networked and highly globalised) economic geographies \u2013 not any \nbounded and un-changing identity (see Agnew, 2000; Bialasiewicz, 2003).  In turn, at \nleast in terms of where the spatial dynamics of power lie, the Padanian case is quite \ndifferent from the historic struggles in the Basque country for an independent nation and \nindependent state from a centrist Spanish polity (Giner, 1998; Guibernau, 2000).  But, I \nbelieve that the compulsion to think regions and regional politics in territorial terms \nremains constant across these differences.  Most versions of the new regionalism share \nthe conviction that region-building and regional protection is the answer for local \neconomic prosperity, democracy, and cultural expression.  In the rest of this section, I \nfocus on what I consider to be two central aspects of the new politics of place.   \n \nA Politics of Territorial Management \n \nThe first feature of the new politics of place can be described as a cadre managerialism \nfashioned for local returns, often defended as a democratic improvement due to the desire \nto break away from central government control.  Much contemporary regionalism is \nconcerned with localizing decision making in core institutions such as regional \ngovernment, regional assemblies and regional development agencies.  Such an \ninstitutional frame is believed to help build a locally integrated economic system gathered \naround the dynamics of clusters, local supply chains, and local knowledge transfer.  In \nthis politics of localism, now actively endorsed by the EU and many national \ngovernments, a strong link is predicated between the economic and the political, based on \nthe establishment of a locally governed institutional structure to support a locally-\noriented economic system (OECD, 2001; DETR, 1997; DTLR, 2001. The European \nUnion has also been very active in promoting regionalisation and regional governance in \nthe candidate states \u2013 see Batt and Wolczuk, 2002).  \n 6\n At one level, it is hard to fault the politics of managerial localism.  Has it not long been \nargued in critical geography that the regional problem is the product of the concentration \nand centralisation of capital and control?  Does it not follow therefore that devolution and \nlocal orientation \u2013 the establishment of a different order of organization and power to that \nof the central state, transnational corporations, and other remote centres of power \u2013 is a \nnecessary first step in reducing regional inequality?  Is local capacity building not a way \nof helping less favoured regions to shed a culture of dependency on central state solutions \n(Amin, 1999)?  Maybe, but only if the option of region-building and growth-from-below \ncan demonstrate that the assumptions of the new economic localism are valid, and if it is \naccompanied by a reduction or radical re-ordering of the primary orders of power that \ncontinue to drive regional fortunes, as it were, from a distance.   \n \nContemporary experiments in devolution, with their endless concern with clusters, \nassemblies, development agencies, and the like, fall short of these two conditions.  First, \nthere is growing evidence to show \u2013 despite the claims of economic localization theorists \n- that in the majority of contemporary corporate and industrial contexts, supply chains, \nlinkage arrangements, and knowledge networks, are not locationally restricted, but highly \ndispersed spatially (Amin, Thrift and Massey, 2003).  Firms now routinely draw on \nhighly distributed supply chains, they pride success on their ability to break out of local \nmarkets, their knowledge base \u2013 both tacit and formal \u2013 is increasingly distanciated and \ntechno-mediated (Amin and Cohendet, 2004), and their infrastructural links \u2013 from \nlogistics to training \u2013 are trans-regional.  These observations cast serious doubt on the \npotential effectiveness of cluster initiatives and their promised local returns.  Second, the \nnew localism cannot pretend to be able to control the forces \u2013 material, virtual and \nimmanent \u2013 that are implicated in new spaces of trans-territorial organization.  These are \nforces that, in the form of share prices and interest rates, shifts in standards and rules, \ncorporate and banking investment decisions, financial transfers, flows of information, \npeople and knowledge, and decisions in far away places, routinely get around, distort or \nannul brave efforts to organize for local benefit.  Finally, as Doreen Massey, Nigel Thrift \nand I have argued in our recent polemic on UK centrism (op. cit.), only too often \n 7\ndevolution and local institution building \u2013 despite the rhetoric of wresting control away \nfrom the central state - comes without any serious attack on the power of defining others, \nranging from central government, powerful states and international organizations, to legal \ncodes, metrics and technological standards formulated elsewhere.   \n \nMy argument is not against building regional voice and representation.  Instead, it is \nagainst the assumption that there is a defined geographical territory out there over which \nlocal actors can have effective control and can manage as a social and political space.  In \na relationally constituted modern world in which it has become normal to conduct \nbusiness \u2013 economic, cultural, political \u2013 through everyday trans-territorial organization \nand flow (Urry, 2002), local advocacy, it seems to me, increasingly must be about \nexercising nodal power and aligning networks at large in your own interest, rather than \nabout exercising territorial power (unless you have access to the core sources such as \ncontrol over the means of coercion and enrolment as do some in some powerful regions \nand states).  I will return to the idea of \u2018nodal\u2019 regional strategies later.  This is not to play \ndown the significance of the powers that come with devolution in areas such as public \nservices, welfare, education, environmental regulation, housing \u2013 where local control can \nhave a decisive influence on the local quality of life.  Instead, it is to caution that these \npowers do not, as so often assumed, add up to an ability to govern a \u2018manageable\u2019 \ngeographical space.  There is no definable regional territory to rule over. \n  \nThis brings me to a second problem, which relates to the meaning of local democracy in \nthe new regionalism.  In the hands of pro-devolution institutions - governmental and non-\ngovernmental - the project amounts to a politics of good management and the inculcation \nof a local managerialist culture.  This may come with plenty of talk about bringing in new \nvoices and civic institutions into decision making and plenty of references to open \ngovernment and public consultation: to doing government in a more inclusive way.  \nThere is nothing wrong with this.  But, it is a restricted democracy that is envisioned, \nfalling well short of a politics of extensive empowerment capable of distributing power \nand responsibility well  beyond the control of an elite entrusted with such work.  On \noccasions when the interpretation of democracy is more broadly defined to include \n 8\nreturning power to \u2018local people\u2019 (e.g. by grass-roots regionalist campaigns), many of the \nproposals for reform \u2013 possibly in the hope of being taken seriously \u2013 appear as mini \nversions of representative democracy, in the form of proposals for elected regional \nassemblies, accountable regional elites, and incorporation of the interests of different \ngroups within the assemblies.  Again, there is nothing wrong with this, but what is on \noffer is an imitative model of democracy, rather than an opportunity for a different and \nmore expanded politics of place, as I will try to illustrate in the last part of the paper.   \n \nA Politics of Territorial Identity \n \nOften, popular support for regional devolution has been sought by appealing to a local \ncultural heritage that needs to be recovered or protected from a threatening cultural \n\u2018outside\u2019.  An insider culture is imagined, and significantly, as a territorially defined \npublic sphere or public culture that can sustain a regionalist political project.  Many \nthreads are woven in narrating a coherent regional community, from stories of \ncolonization and a common external enemy, to stories of heroism and resistance, as well \nas the scripting of a regional folk culture.  A strong regional culture along these lines is \nassumed to help cement a strong public sphere composed of common interests, local \norientation and active deliberation over a local way of life (see Paasi, 1996). \n \nI acknowledge the risk of cultural caricature and over-stated insiderism in this summary, \nbut the point that remains valid is that devolution politics is grounded in an imaginary of \nthe region as a space of intimacy, shared history or shared identity, and community of \ninterest or fate.  These have become the motivating cultural reasons for a politics of local \nregard and local defense to be delivered through devolution.  Regional identification, the \npresence of a local public sphere, and regional autonomy are assumed to go hand in hand \nand mutually reinforce each other.  Of course, how the relationship between these three \nphenomena is played out varies from case to case.  For example, the regionalism of the \n\u2018Celtic nations\u2019 or the Basque country draws upon a strong sense of regional \nidentification and cultural unity (Le Coadic, 2002), while in the case of the economically \nstrong regions that are seeking to break away from the rest of the nation, such as \n 9\n\u2018Padania\u2019 (and increasingly London, around the falsity that it subsidises the rest of the \nnation), the appeal to local cultural homogeneity is weak.  In turn, regions such as \nCatalonia, Tuscany or South West Sweden play upon the merits of a distinctive public \nsphere rather than a regional homeland.   \n \nA politics of territorial identification comes with a baggage of problematic assumptions.  \nFirst, it cannot be taken as given that strong regional identification along the lines \noutlined above captures cultural practices in most regions of Europe, and that it gathers a \nlocal public into a politics of regionalism.   We know from a deluge of writing in cultural \nstudies that a key consequence of contemporary globalism is the rise of composite and \nhybrid cultures, and hyphenated and diasporic identities.  This globalism, through the \neveryday powers of consumer, lifestyle and media habits defines the cultural practices of \nmost ethnic, class, gender and generational groupings, even those who consciously rant \nagainst modernity and globalization, from religious, cultural and regional \nconservationists to ethno-nationalists and folklorists (some of these contradictions are \npoignantly captured in Linda McDowell\u2019s account here of the cultural practices of \ndisaffected young men in British urban estates).  \n \nThe salient point is that cultural globalism has become the everyday filter through which \nregional attachment or sense of place is developed and expressed (see also Paasi, 2002).  \nThe result is not a weakened sense of place necessarily, but a heterotopic sense of place \nthat is no longer reducible to regional moorings or to a territorially confined public \nsphere, but is one made up of influences that fold together the culturally plural and the \ngeographically proximate and distant.  Increasingly, cultural attachment to a given city of \nregion is defined through plural spaces of attachment, and for this, it provides no easy \npromise for a politics hooked around the myth of a regionalized identity.  This is not to \ndiminish the validity of a politics of place or to deny place attachment.  Far from it.  It is, \ninstead, to question a politics of place based on the idea of a territorial commons or a \ncohesive territorial culture.  Clearly there are exceptions such as Bosnia and Serbia or \nother similar ethno-nationalist regionalist claims driven by a pathology of colonial or \nethno-nationalist abuse, but the norm elsewhere is a politics of place based on other \n 10\nforms of place attachment such as a fondness for where you live or for a particular \nregional way of life, or other forms of struggles such as those over local quality of life or \ndecisions made by local authorities.   \n \nThis brings me to a second objection.  It is all too easy to think that cities and regions \noffer territorially defined public spheres.  The popular imagination abounds with easy \nlabeling of apathetic publics here, buzzes of urban creativity and intermingling there, \nactive public deliberation and debate somewhere else, state dependency or familism in \nother places.  Academic writing on social capital has given further legitimacy to \ncaricatures of place based on assumptions about prevailing local public cultures\/spheres, \nto label, for example, some regions as civic regions (lots of social capital, lots of \ndeliberation, lots of state transparency) and others as bureaucratic (state-driven, low \nlevels of public participation, weak associationalism) or individualist (lots of market, \nproliferation of entrepreneurial cultures, weak state).   \n \nThese caricatures come with a grain of truth about the nature of local public spheres, but \nthe political conclusions draws are far fetched.  The link between the local public sphere \nand the local political culture can only ever be indirect.  For a start, it is an error to \nimagine the local public sphere in purely localist terms.  The public sphere, that is the \ndiscursive arena in which any individual here or there can participate with aid of many \n\u2018traveling\u2019 technologies such as books, newspapers, billboards, the media, the internet, is \ntrans-territorrial vy very definition.  It is a mobile, circulating, and ubiquitous space \n(Warner,  ), one that can generate associations and discursive engagements at a variety of \nspatial scales and a variety of spatial forms (from transnational ethical networks and \nglobal news audiences to school playgrounds and chat rooms).  Any particular \ngeographical site can only ever be a nodal connection in a hydra-like network space that \nnever coheres into a local public sphere.  Cities and regions are nodes in many public \nspheres, sustaining many geographies of attachment and political practice (see also \nPerulli, 1998).  They do not automatically come with a strong local public sphere.  An \nobvious implication is that there is no pre-given place for a politics of regionalism.  Any \n 11\nsuch outcome can only be the result of a deliberate campaign to fashion a community of \nlocal sentiment (over other political projects).   \n \nA Relational Politics of Place  \n \nI want to argue that a relational reading of cities and regions offers a very different \nreading of place politics, one that is neither a-spatial (i.e. where the local is reduced to a \nmere stage) nor territorial (i.e. where the geographical local is all), but topological (i.e. \nwhere the local brings together different scales of practice\/social action \u2013 see Agnew, \n1994).  I want to explore a politics of place that is consistent with a spatial ontology of \ncities and regions seen as sites of heterogeneity juxtaposed within close spatial proximity, \nand as sites of multiple geographies of affiliation, linkage and flow.  I wish to claim that \nassociated with each is a specific spatial register of politics, adding up to a very different \nand expanded sense of the political that we find in the new regionalism (even if certain \nthe local institutional arrangements \u2013 from assemblies to other represented interests \u2013 \nmay reappear).  We could, experimentally, summarize the political challenges of these \ntwo spatial registers of place respectively as the politics of propinquity and the politics of \nconnectivity (or transitivity).  I use the caveat \u2018experimental\u2019 because political geography, \ngeopolitics and international relations lack an established terminology able to synthesize \npolitics in non-territorial terms, but, at the same time, also able to retain a strong sense of \nthe spatiality of social relations (without reducing this spatiality to a dewy-eyed localism \nas Massey warns in her article, or to some other form of boundary politics).  What \nfollows, thus, is a tentative framing of site politics in relational terms.  It is the sketch of \nan alternative imaginary that is crying out for other dimensions of site politics to be \nfashioned. \n \nA Politics of Propinquity \n \nOne major aspect of globalization that any politics of place has to come to grips with is \nthe intense everyday negotiation of diversity in most cities and regions, associated with \nthe exposure to cultural, social, experiential and aspirational difference among those who \n 12\nshare a given regional space.   The politics of a local society made up of bit arrangements \nand plural cultures that never quite cohere or fit together, can no longer be cast as a a \npolitics of intimacy or shared regional cultures.   \n \nWhat, then are the alternatives?  One temptation \u2013 indeed a fashion nowadays in readings \nof Benjamin, Lefebvre and Aug\u00e9 that interpret the local as the arena of the prosaic and \nthe habitual - is to imagine the politics of propinquity as the politics of the everyday.  \nAccordingly, such a politics might attend to the challenges thrown up by negotiations of \neveryday difference in habituated spaced such as work, welfare, housing, schooling, \npublic space, public services, and so on.  The focus would fall on, for example, how \ndiversity is represented, how interests are contested, how different needs are met and \nreconciled.  Indeed, there is no shortage of this style of local politics even if rarely \ngrasped as a politics of propinquity.  Debates in planning, local government studies, and \nsocial policy are inundated with practical suggestions about how everyday public goods \nshould be distributed, about how different voices and interests can be heard, about how \nlocal differences can be reconciled.  This reading of the everyday is the bread and butter \nof local politics everywhere, but it is an unnecessarily restrictive interpretation.  \nIncreasingly daily life is constituted through attachments and influences that are \ndistanciated, as revealed by the workings of diaspora communities, corporate networks, \nconsumption patterns, travel networks, microworlds of communication, and the many \npublic spheres that stretch across space.  These translocal aspects of the habitual cannot \nbe written out of a politics of propinquity, but tend to be undervalued in accounts of the \neveryday taken as the geographically proximate.   \n \nI wish to read the politics of propinquity relationally, in order to rule in everything that \nvies for attention in a given location.  As such, it is a politics that cannot be confined to \nthe everyday local or the intimate, such that spaces of the international or national can be \ntreated as spaces for another kind of politics (e.g. the politics of regulations, standards, \n\u2018big\u2019 issues, state affairs).  But, with everything ruled in as the \u2018political\u2019 at urban and \nregional level, a legitimate question is whether there remains anything specific about \nplace politics.  It is tempting to answer that place politics is no different from any other \n 13\nkind of spatial politics, such as negotiations of issues arising at the national or \ninternational stage, or the machinations of more fluid political configurations such as \nglobal protest movements.  It comes, however, with the risk of rubbing out potentially \nmeaningful political effects associated with differences in spatial configuration.  Space \ncan talk back.   \n \nI wish to experiment with the proposition that if there is something distinctive about the \npolitics of place as a spatial phenomenon (which is not the same as wanting to claim that \nthe difference lies in what counts as the political at the local level), it is that different \nmicroworlds find themselves on the same turf, and that the pull on turf in different \ndirections and different interests needs to be actively managed and negotiated, because \nthere is no other turf.  In other words, it is a politics shaped by the issues thrown up by \nliving with diversity and sharing a common territorial space.  Of course, both of these \naspects also figure in other spatial arenas.  For example, in contemporary debate on \nbelonging and citizenship in a multicultural society, the nation has been taken as the \nprime locus of concern regarding diversity and a shared territorial commons.  The \nnational is intensely contested as a sacred space and as a site of belonging, as we know \nfrom the scars of state and nationalist attacks on immigrants and asylum seekers.  What is \nperhaps distinctive about the local turf, however, is that it is perceived as a micro-world \nthat is experienced and contested as a lived space; as heterogeneity habitually negotiated \nthrough struggles over roads and noise, public spaces, siting decisions, neighbourhoods \nand neighbours, housing developments, street life, and so on. \n \nThe politics of propinquity, then, can be read as a politics of negotiating the immanent \neffects of geographical juxtaposition between physical spaces, overlapping communities, \ncontrasting cultural practices.  As such, the politics of propinquity is neither \nautomatically benign or malign, it has no pre-given remit, institutional composition and \nconduct, and it comes with no territorial restriction of its spatial architecture and \nalignments.  Instead, all it be sure of is to take spatial juxtaposition seriously as a field of \nagonistic engagement.  This means seeing the local political arena as a field of claims and \ncounter-claims, agreements and coalitions that are always temporary and fragile, always \n 14\nthe product of negotiation and changing inter-sectional dynamics, always spreading out to \nwherever a claim on turf or on proximate strangers is made or to where novelty is \ngenerated by juxtaposition.  One implication of this interpretation is that the politics of \npropinquity must be as much about what is struggled over (turf, difference and the \nforcings of spatial juxtaposition), as it must be about the conduct of local politics, in \nallowing agonistic engagement (contra the politics of governmentality) and about who or \nwhat counts as political, through its recognition of the acts of expression and organization \nacross local society (contra the powers of designated institutions).   \n \nWe now have a politics of place that looks very different from the politics of regional \nmanagement or regional destiny that have become the hallmark of territorial regionalism.  \nIt makes for a vision and a set of political priorities established out of the open but fair \npower-play between agonistic actors and their competing and often conflicting claims.  It \naccepts that a regional agenda has to be fashioned out of the disparate interests and the \ndifferent worlds of connectivity that overlap in a given places, through active public \ndiscussion of different visions of what kind of local turf is desired and in whose interest \n(from the vested classes and majority communities to minorities, outsiders, and distant \nstrangers).  \u2018Region-building\u2019 becomes altogether different in a politics of place that \nworks with and through the fragments (Paasi, 1996).  It becomes an act of the free play of \nan active and plural regional body politic and a plural public sphere; an act of making the \ninvisible part of the register of political life (e.g. by decentralizing decision-making to \ncivic organizations and communities, by envisioning planning as an aggregated and \ndiscursively negotiated choice of visions and strategies, by bringing into play sentiments, \nethics, emotions, aesthetics, ambiguity and uncertainty into the field of what counts as \npolitical).  It becomes an act of developing a sense of place and place attachment that \nworks with difference and distance, assuming no indigeneity or privileged set of \nclaimants.  Finally, it becomes an act of acceptance that the shared commons that we \nchoose to call a regional way of life is only ever relationally and discursively constituted.  \n \nThose impatient for normative clarity will object that this alternative reading of \nregionalism is irresponsibly imprecise in that it lacks a vision of the good life. The critics \n 15\nno doubt will include the regional policy community keen on targets as well as activists \non the Left and the Right driven by a vision of what is to be done and for whom.  In \ndefence, I will make three points.  First, the alternative reading has nothing to do with \nmaking up policy as you go along or not having clear normative objectives.  My \nargument is simply that these should be the product of active debate, after different \nvisions and preferences have been brought to the table and given legitimacy.  My \nargument is against a presumed hierarchy of worth or order.  It is not a rejection of \nnormative purpose, but of its formulation in advance of agonistic engagement.   \n \nSecond, and consequently, the alternative normativity is the product of a desire to take \n(regional) democracy seriously.  I find it hard to see how contemporary versions of \nterritorial regionalism are an act of democratization, which should achieve more that \nestablishing new centres of power at the regional scale, that is, more than devolved \ngovernment.  As an act of democratization, it should also extend the franchise, bring in \nnew voices, deal with power asymmetries, decentre authority and responsibility, and \npluralize the decision making process.  A democratic regionalism, consequently, has to \naccept the novelties, antagonisms, unpredictable outcomes, and excess generated by \nallowing heterogeneity and difference to be voiced.   \n \nThird, the alternative regionalism brings new priorities into the frame of what needs \nattending.  This includes above all the issues thrown up by the juxtaposition of difference, \nranging from those related to indigeneity, ethnicity and sense of place, to those related to \nthe rights of claim of different economic interests in a region.  I find it surprising that \ncurrent regionalist mantras have nothing much to ask in the cultural realm about changing \nsenses of place and place attachment in a multiethnic and multicultural society, or in the \neconomic realm, about whether the interests and practices of actors gathered in the local \neconomy \u2013 from maintenance and repair and distribution and logistics to the informal \nsector, public services, small firms and the corporate sector \u2013 can be gathered into \nclusters of local interdependence.  A sense of the local as a fractal culture or fractal \neconomy would yield a very different local politics, one which would begin with the \nassumption that there is no local cultural or economic coherence.  \n 16\n A Politics of Connectivity \n \nThe plural public sphere that is involved in the making of a region is a spatially diffuse \nand geographically mobile sphere.  It calls forth a politics of place that works through this \nconstitutive condition, not one that fakes, as does the new regionalism, a minor national \npolitics of assumed territorial insides and outsides and an imagined regional identity.  As \nI have already argued, it is difficult to imagine areas of social life that are not folded into \nspatially stretched circuits of organization\/flow involving money, trade, work, faith, \nbelief, consumption, information, knowledge, and power.  Equally, it is difficult to hold \non to an idea of the public sphere as a territorial given.  Whatever we choose to describe \nas the institutions and practices of regionalism comes with connections, meanings, and \ninfluences that are never quite of that place.   \n \nIt follows that a politics of place, whether we like it or not, has to work with the varied \ngeographies of relational connectivity and transitivity that make up public life and the \nlocal political realm in general in a city or region.  Analytically, the new regionalism \nacknowledges this constitutive exteriority.  Most contemporary variants recognize the \nlocal transformations brought about by immigration, travel and exodus, global cultural \nconnectivity, external economic integration and the rise of trans-local business chains, \nmediatised or virtual worlds, and other elements of the globalised modern.  It is generally \naccepted by regionalists that local life is shot through with these influences.  \nNormatively, however, this exteriority is either rejected or played down.  So, for \nexample, autonomist and cultural regionalists tend to shut it out through strong narratives \nof local embedding and local pedigree, which allows them to fabricate a pure imagined \nlocal community.  Meanwhile, pragmatic regionalists and devolutionists have tended to \nsee such exteriority as ontologically separate from a regional \u2018inside\u2019 that can still be \nmobilized and organized to drive local fortunes through such interventions as clusters and \njoined-up government.  \n \n 17\nA politics of place rooted in the idea that \u2018we make space through interactions at all \nlevels\u2019 (Massey, this volume, p 1) has to be different.  It has to be fashioned through the \nvaried spatialities of connectivity and transitivity that cross a given region, such that the \ninside and the outside are no longer locationally defined.  What is deemed as \u2018local \nspace\u2019 and what is deemed to be a local priority cannot be determined territorially, but in \nother ways.  A start would be to define regional priorities programmatically, contested \nthrough relationally constituted communities of attachment and resistance.  The result is a \nregional \u2018inside\u2019 constructed through public debate over a particular political programmes \nor visions of the good life.  Indeed, this should happen in ways open to both local and \ndistant actors to sign up to a given programme, thereby, at the very least, freeing \nproximate strangers who inhabit different worlds from the tyranny of belonging to a \n\u2018local community\u2019 with shared interests.   \n \nThere are significant changes in the conduct of regional politics that follow from this \nemphasis on a politics of programme conducted through spaces of relational connectivity, \nas Doreen Massey, Nigel Thrift and I have begun to argue in our work on cosmopolitan \nregionalism (Amin, Massey and Thrift, 2003).  Two examples \u2013 one related to the \nregional economic priorities and the other related to regional cultural priorities \u2013 might \nhelp to illustrate the difference.  First, in a relational politics of place, decisions \nconcerning what is good or bad for the local economy would no be decoupled from scalar \nor territorial assumptions, which in the new regionalism routinely hold that \u2018local\u2019 \nautonomy is empowering, while \u2018external\u2019 control is disabling, that local agglomeration \nincreases local returns while global commodity chains seeps profits away, that home-\ngrown institutions are locally-oriented while distant institutions are predatory or \nindifferent.  Instead, judgement over economic worth would be based on public scrutiny \nof alternative models of economic prosperity and well-being (e.g. neo-liberal versus \nsocial democratic) and competing visions of the economic good life, which are approved \nor not by residents on the basis of how well a vision fits with their interests that may well \nbe locked into spatial connectivities beyond the region.   \n \n 18\nThe task, then, of local debate on economic priorities \u2013 within the development \ncorporations, in regional assemblies, in the public arena \u2013 would become that of \ndiscussing what kind of regional economy is desired, with those who promise various \nreturns extected to make transparent the distributional benefits associated with competing \nmodels of regional prosperity, instead of relying on the make belief that that economic \nlocalism in its own right promises regional competitiveness and rewards for all.  \nWhatever fictions there may be about regarding the inevitability of neo-liberal economics \nor the inevitability of \u2018container\u2019 policies, even the most cursory glance at experience in \ndifferent parts of the world reveals the work of plural models of economic prosperity and \norganization.  There are different models, each with its own spatial connectivities, each \nwith particular local implications, each demanding a different set of policy solutions and \npolicy actors in order to maximize local returns.   \n \nThe models and their consequences need to be publicized.  For example, there is a stark \nchoice between a growth model that draws on TNC power, migrant labour, local elites, \nwage restraint, and minimum regulation, and a growth model that builds on social needs, \nfair trade, redistribution, social investment, international cooperation, mutual funds, and \nties with other regions trying to pursue a similar economic agenda.  The first model, \nwhich is not that far from the circumstances faced by many less prosperous regions, is a \ngrowth-before-equity model that is driven by rewarding sectional interests, that draws on \na local-global relational connectivity geared towards cost minimization and profit \nmaximization, and that requires policy interventions of a very particular kind (e.g. \nupgrading of the local supply base, attraction of more skilled labour, qualitative \nincentives to TNCs) in order to better local returns (if alternative models are unfeasible).  \nThe second model, a growth-for-equity model, works on the principles of mutuality and \nsocial obligation, requires work to be done to legitimate an economy of graduated growth \nand reduced income differentials and a culture of social solidarity that could tie in \ncitizens both locally and a world away.  This contrast is clearly a caricature, but my point \nis to highlight how different the discussion on regional economic priorities can become \nonce the analysis of \u2018local returns\u2019 is situated within a frame of working in connections of \n 19\npower and mutuality around particular visions of economic well-being (with no a priori \nprivilege given to what happens to be \u2018indigenous\u2019). \n \nSimilarly, in the area of cultural priorities - to come to the second example \u2013 attention in \na frame of a politics of connectivity would fall on the actual, material dynamics of \ncultural formation, since no ontology of origin or indigeneity would be assumed.  Here \ntoo, however, it does not follow that a politics of connectivity freed from the baggage of \nregional nostalgia will yield a regionalism that automatically recognizes cultural \ndifference and hybridity.  Instead, as with the economy, the imperative is to arrange for \nactive debate over different models of cultural connectivity, over the kind of cultural \nconnections that people in a region wishes to defend, over the value of relational \ninteractions beyond the region.   \n \nAgain, for the sake of illustration, we can compare two very different versions of cultural \nconnectivity circulating in current debates on multiculturalism.  One is a \u2018consumer\u2019 \ncosmopolitanism, typified by the EU programme on European Cities of Culture, which \ncelebrates cities and regions as cultural gateways, and plays on the virtues of world \nmusic, minority ethnic food and festival, regeneration based on multicultures and \nmultiethnic public spaces, and the exoticism of the stranger.  A raft of contemporary \nurban and regional regeneration strategies play on this aspect of belonging in the world in \norder to re-boot the local economy through new consumption, as well as to demonstrate \nan openness to multiculturalism and multiethnicity.  Another version of cultural \nconnectivity is a cosmopolitan ethos of solidarity and rights that has been growing in \ndifferent parts of the world as a form of local response to global poverty, ethnic \nintolerance and Empire.  It is based on combating racism, protecting the rights of \ndisplaced people and asylum seekers and fostering inter-cultural dialogue and \ncommitment to distant strangers.  It frequently involves local groups developing voice \nand impact through worldwide solidarity networks and social movements in order to \nshape and influence cultural politics both \u2018at home\u2019 and in other regions.  While cultural \nconnectivity in both examples rejects an idea of the region as a place of reminiscence and \ncultural preservation, neither share the same sense of place in the world.   \n 20\n As in the example of the economy, the point is that the politics of connectivity is not \nabout the balance between localism and globalism.  It is a matter of making explicit and \nof choosing between different senses of place and place attachment on the basis of \nagonistic engagement between different coalitions of cultural and geographical \nattachment.  Thus conceived, a region should be able to be claimed can also be claimed \nby distant others, and in turn, able to link up with developments elsewhere on the basis of \ngenuine normative complementarity.   \n \nConclusion \n \nMy aim in this paper has been to articulate a relationally imagined regionalism that is \nfreed from the constraints of territorial jurisdiction.  I have tried to show that if place  \nmatters in this perspective it is through the challenges \u2013 cultural, economic and political - \nthrown up by the spatial juxtaposition of difference and by the effects of connectivity in a \nmultitude of relational spaces.  I have tried to illustrate that these spatial effects really do \ncount, in terms of what is conjured up for political attention, what is deemed significant \nor possible, and what, who and where are mobilized by the political process.   \n \nOne question I wish to return to is whether in this alternative reading of regionalism  \nanything remains distinctive about place politics.  A vein of argument in this paper has \nbeen that what goes on in a city or region is about questions of political choice and \ndemocracy that could be found anywhere, which makes the politics of cities and regions \nno different from the politics of, say, the household, the nation, or the internet.  There is \nnothing gained from fetishizing cities and regions as particular kinds of community that \nlend themselves to territorially-defined or spatially constrained political arrangements \nand choices.  This simply diminishes the political at urban and regional level or restricts it \nto particular tasks.  The typical current assumption is that while national governments \nshould conduct the affairs of the land, regions should concentrate on local matters alone, \nor that while the nation should decide on matters of asylum, immigration, and racism, \nregions should concentrate on \u2018smaller\u2019 or local cultural questions).   \n 21\n But, it is not adequate to stop here, as this is to erode the significance of spatial \ndifference.  I have claimed that cities and regions possess a distinctive spatiality as \nagglomerations of heterogeneity locked into a multitude of relational networks of varying \ngeographical reach.  As such, they express, perhaps more than other socio-spatial \nformations (nations, households, organizations, virtual and imagined communities), the \nmost intense manifestations of propinquity and multiple spatial connectivity.  They are \ndistinctive \u2018nodal\u2019 formations, and as such, they illuminate a particular kind of spatial \npolitics.  They could be seen as the forcing ground for challenges that are thrown up \nwhen difference is so visibly gathered in one place and when a globality of myriad flows \nand connections is temporarily halted in one place.  The placement of different economic \nactors, different cultures, different citizens and non-citizens, different dreams, and \ndifferent needs vies for attention in itself through the effects of spatial proximity (anger, \ndissonance, distance, visibility, encounter, evasion, mobility, non-correspondence).  In \nturn, the global flows and connectivities constantly throw up new dilemmas of placement, \npossibly also new political challenges, from those related to everyday negotiations of \ncultural diversity or conflicts between a changing local populace over the everyday turf, \nto reimaginations of the local through diaspora and transnational (be)longings or \nstrategies of local economic renewal based on the remittance economy.  If thought of \nrelationally, cities and regions could become generators of a kind of democratic energy \nbecause they would continually act to remind citizens what the stakes are in living with \ndifference and everyday global connectivity. \n  \nAcknowlegdements  \n \nI am very grateful to Luiza Bialasiewicz, Stuart Elden, and Gordon MacLeod and for \ntheir help in finalizing this paper.\n 22\n References \n \nAgnew J, 1994, \u2018The territorial trap: the geographical assumptions of international \nrelations theory\u2019 Review of International Political Economy 1 53-80 \nAgnew J, 2000, \u2018The road to Padania: the Northern League and Italian regionalism\u201d \nInternational Journal of Urban and Regional Research 24 227-231 \nAmin A (1999) 'An institutionalist perspective on regional development', International \nJournal of Urban and Regional Research, 2: 365-378. \nAmin, A (2002) \u2018Spatialities of globalisation\u2019, Environment and Planning A, 34, 3: 385-\n99. \nAmin A and P Cohendet (2004) Architectures of Knowledge: Firms, Capabilities, and \nCommunities, Oxford University Press, Oxford. \nAmin, A, Massey, D and N Thrift (2003) Decentering the Nation: a Radical Approach to \nRegional Inequality, Catalyst, London. \nAmin, A and N Thrift (2002) Cities: Rethinking Urban Theory, Polity, Cambridge. \nBatt, J. and K.
