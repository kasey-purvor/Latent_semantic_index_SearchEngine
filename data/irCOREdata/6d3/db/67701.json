J. Smith, M. P. Freeman, and S. Hunter\nBritish Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, UK\nD. K. Milling\nDepartment of Physics, University of York, York, UK\nReceived 15 March 2002; revised 26 June 2002; accepted 9 September 2002; published 13 December 2002.\n[1] A superposed epoch analysis of 100\u2013300 substorms is performed to determine the\nmedian size and shape of the substorm-associated VLF chorus, magnetic bay, and Pi2\npulsation burst observed at the near-auroral Halley research station, Antarctica, and at the\nmidlatitude Faraday station at three different local times (2230, 2330, 0130 MLT). The\nspatial and temporal properties of the magnetic bay signatures are compared with the\nUniversity of York implementation of the Kisabeth\u2013Rostoker substorm current wedge\n(SCW)model and theWeimer pulse model, respectively. These constitute the best analytical\nmodels of the substorm to date. It is shown that the polarities and relative amplitudes of the\nobserved magnetic bays in the H, D, and Z components at Halley at midnight MLT and\nat Faraday in the premidnight sector are consistent with the York model for a SCW 3 hours\nwide in MLTwith its westward electrojet at 67\u0001S magnetic latitude. In particular the little-\ndiscussed Z component of the bay agrees with the model and is shown to be the clearest\nsubstorm signature of the three components, especially at midlatitude. The midnight and\npostmidnight bays are similar to the premidnight case but progressively smaller and cannot\nbe fully reconciled with the model. The shape of theH and Z bays at Halley and theD bays at\nFaraday fit a normalized Weimer pulse well, with Weimer\u2019s 2 h\u00011 recovery rate, but the\nother components do not. The D component at Halley and H at Faraday do fit the Weimer\npulse shape but with a faster recovery rate of 4 h\u00011. It is proposed that this is due to the effect\nof a decaying current in the SCW combining with the geometrical effect of changing\nSCW configuration and position relative to the observing station. The Z component at\nFaraday recovers more slowly than the 2 h\u00011 Weimer prediction; we cannot explain this.\nSecondary bays at Halley and Faraday show a clear tendency to recur after 2 hours.\nInflection points just prior to onset at Halley and Faraday are argued to be related to reduced\nconvection associated with northward turning of the IMF. The median substorm signature at\nHalley in the Pi2 frequency band (7\u201325 mHz) is well correlated with the bay structure,\nshowing that it is part of a broader band, possibly turbulent, spectrum in the substorm-\ndependent DP2 current. There is evidence of a minor additional narrow band component\noccurring at substorm onset. This is the dominant signal at Faraday which shows the classic\nmidlatitude substorm signature, a short Pi2 pulsation burst at onset, that decreases\nprogressively in intensity with increasing local time, implying a source region biased to the\nevening side or else preferred propagation to the east from a near-midnight source.

The textbook \u2018\u2018typical event\u2019\u2019 is rarely seen.\nIn a previous paper [Smith et al., 1999] we used a super-\nposed epoch analysis to establish the typical magnetic bay\nresponse to the substorm current wedge as observed by\nmagnetometers at a near-auroral-zone ground station (Hal-\nley, Antarctica). The rationale was to use a large number of\nevents in order to extract the essential and persistent features\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 107, NO. A12, 1439, doi:10.1029\/2002JA009389, 2002\nCopyright 2002 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/02\/2002JA009389$09.00\nSMP 14 - 1\nof the substorm response. We used a normalization proce-\ndure and took a median rather than a mean of the ensemble\nof cases, so that large and small (or distant and near) events\ncarried equal weight, in order that the results would not be\nskewed by a few unusually large events.\n[3] To identify the epoch of a substorm expansion phase\nonset, we used the SCE (substorm chorus event) signature\n[Smith et al., 1996; Smith, 1997], which is sensitive to the\nwhistler mode waves generated by energetic electrons\ninjected at onset. The ground SCE is perhaps a less familiar\nsubstorm signature than some others but has the advantage\nthat it is observed independently of the magnetometers, is\neasy to identify in the data, and usually has a well-defined\nonset time. A single ground VLF station can detect SCEs\noriginating over a range of L-shells and longitudes. For\nthese reasons we have assembled a large database of event\ntimes (over 2500) from SCEs observed at Halley since 1992\nwhen the VELOX VLF\/ELF receiver began operating, and\nhere we use subsets of events drawn from that database. A\ndisadvantage of our technique for identifying substorms is\nthat because the injected electrons drift eastward, the SCE is\nseen only when the observing station is to the east of the\ninjection region, typically from just before local magnetic\nmidnight until dawn.\n[4] The main aim of the present study is to apply the\nSmith et al. [1999] approach to investigate the typical\nsubstorm-related magnetic bay response at a lower latitude\nground station (Faraday\/Vernadsky, Antarctica). The results\nare discussed in terms of the substorm current wedge\nmodel. Although there is an extensive literature on this\nsubject, there have been relatively few statistical studies.\nCaan et al. [1978] carried out a superposed epoch analysis\nof \u00021800 substorms to derive the average substorm sig-\nnatures in midlatitude magnetograms at four local times\n(00, 06, 12, and 18 hours), in auroral zone magnetograms\nat two local times (17 hours and 24 hours), and in the AE,\nAL, and AU indices. The epochs were onset times of the\nsubstorms derived from a pattern recognition analysis of\nmidlatitude magnetograms. Weimer [1994] did a similar\nanalysis for AE, AL, and AU for 55 events, using AE to\ndetermine the onset times. The study by Kamide and\nKroehl [1994] was for 42 relatively large substorm events\nin which they determined the average substorm signature in\nauroral zone H-component ground magnetograms at three\nlocal times (00, 06, 18 hours), relative to quiet conditions.\nThe data were not direct observations but were computed\nfrom the AL index, and the reference epoch was taken to\nbe the peak of the 00 hour data rather than the substorm\nonset time.\n[5] In this paper we use a superposed epoch analysis to\ndetermine the average substorm effect first for the near-\nauroral Halley station at local midnight (for comparison\nwith Smith et al., [1999]) and then for the midlatitude\nFaraday station at three local times (premidnight, near-\nmidnight, and postmidnight), more closely spaced than the\nabove-mentioned studies. The numbers of substorms used\nin the averaging (123, 282, 189, and 136, respectively) were\nless than Caan et al. [1978] but larger than Weimer [1994]\nand Kamide and Kroehl [1994]. Like Caan et al. [1978] we\ninclude the midlatitude Z-component which has otherwise\nbeen little treated in past work. We also analyze Pi2\nmagnetic variations (frequencies 7\u201325 mHz) at both the\nnear-auroral and midlatitude stations using the same ap-\nproach. An important difference between this paper and\nprevious work is that the set of epochs is defined without\nany reference to the magnetic data, thus avoiding a possible\nsource of bias. The substorm onsets are determined from\nsubstorm chorus events which serve as a ground-observed\nproxy for the injection of energetic electron fluxes into the\nring current at the expansion phase onset.\n2. Data Sources\n[6] In this paper we use ELF\/VLF radio wave data from\nthe VELOX instrument at Halley station (76\u0001S, 27\u0001W, L =\n4.3) [Smith, 1995], magnetic data from the three-component\nfluxgate magnetometer at Halley [Dudeney et al., 1995],\nand magnetic data from the similar magnetometer at the\nArgentine Islands geomagnetic observatory, Faraday station\n(65\u0001S, 64\u0001W, L = 2.3) [Cotton and Simmons, 1986]. Fara-\nday was renamed Vernadsky when it was taken over by the\nUkraine in February 1996, but for simplicity it will be\nreferred to throughout this paper as \u2018\u2018Faraday\u2019\u2019 even though\nwe have used data from both before and after the name\nchange. The time resolution of the Halley magnetometer\ndata is 1 s whereas that of the Faraday data is 20 s. The\namplitude resolution is 1 nT in both cases. The three\nmagnetic components are H (positive northward in the local\nmagnetic frame), D (positive eastward), and Z (positive\nupward). Note that our sign convention for Z is the opposite\nof that normally used in the Northern Hemisphere.\n3. Analysis and Results\n3.1. A Sample Event\n[7] We first present an event which exemplifies the data\ncontributing to the superposed epoch analyses described\nlater. Figure 1 shows the magnetic field and ELF\/VLF wave\nresponse at Halley and Faraday to a substorm which\noccurred close to magnetic midnight at Halley (\u00023 UT),\nwhen Faraday was still in the evening sector (\u00022230 MLT).\nThe characteristics of the SCE (Figure 1b) and magnetic bay\n(Figure 1d) observed at Halley are typical of events pre-\nviously published, e.g. in Plate 1 of Smith et al. [1999]. The\nepoch of the SCE, defined as the time at which the signal in\nthe 1.5 kHz channel begins to increase above the preevent\nlevel, is marked by the arrow. This time is indicated by the\nvertical dotted line in the other panels and is seen from\nFigure 1a to be close to the time at which the AE index\nbegan to increase (i.e., the substorm expansion phase onset).\nThe magnetic bay was negative in H, close to zero in D, and\nnegative in Z, as is commonly observed at Halley which is\nusually located a little equatorward of the auroral oval at\nmidnight.\n[8] At Faraday, premidnight and well equatorward of the\noval, the magnetic bay (Figure 1c) was positive in H,\nnegative in D, and close to zero in Z. The deviations in\nall components were much smaller in magnitude than at\nHalley (note the difference in scales between Figures 1c and\n1d). The signs of the changes are consistent with Rostoker\n[1972] for a low-latitude station when translated to the\nSouthern Hemisphere (D and Z change sign but not H ),\nand account is taken of our opposite sign convention for Z.\nThe small oscillations near the substorm onset were mainly\nSMP 14 - 2 SMITH ET AL.: VLF, MAGNETIC, AND PI2 SUBSTORM SIGNATURES\nin the Pi2 frequency band and have been extracted using a\n40\u2013150 s (7\u201325 mHz) bandpass filter (Figure 1e). The 1-\nmin RMS averaged power in this band (Figure 1g) shows\nthe well-known pulses of Pi2 power at substorm onset, the\neffect being greatest in the H component. Comparing with\nthe measurements at Halley (Figures 1f and 1h), the power\nwas lower at Faraday than Halley, and in fact in this case\nwas only just above the instrument sensitivity (\u00b10.5 nT).\nHaving looked at a single event, we will now use a super-\nposed epoch method, almost identical to that of our previous\nstudy [Smith et al., 1999], to investigate the typical size and\nrelative timing of the different substorm signatures as a\nfunction of latitude and magnetic local time.\n3.2. Superposed Epoch Analysis for a Near-Auroral\nStation L \u0002 4 (Halley)\n[9] As in our previous study, we used a number of criteria\nto select a set of epochs of the substorm expansion phase\nonset from our database of SCEs. The study was over the 4-\nyear interval 1993\u20131996, for which there were a total of\n1043 events in the database. First, we required the epoch to\nbe in the interval 0200\u20130400 UT, i.e., within \u00021 hour of\nFigure 1.

Second, if there was\nmore than one event having its epoch within that time\ninterval, we chose only the first. An additional criterion for\nthe present study was that we required there to be no data\ngaps in the magnetic data, which would have caused\nproblems in the filtering process. Applying the above\ncriteria to the database yielded 123 events. All the data sets\n(ELF\/VLF, magnetic bay and Pi2 power) were converted to\n1-min time resolution as described above and normalized as\ndescribed by Smith et al. [1999] so as to linearly transform\nthe data points in the \u2018\u2018normalization interval\u2019\u2019 to the range\n0\u20131. This was done in order that a few large events did not\ndistort the results. For the ELF\/VLF and magnetic bay data\nthe normalization interval was between \u00011 hour and +3\nhours relative to the SCE epoch; for the Pi2 data, because of\nits more transient character, the normalization interval was\ntaken to be from \u000130 min to +30 min because it was\nexpected to be more localized to the substorm onset. The\ndata were then epoch-aligned and the median and quartile\npoints found for each minute relative to the epoch, from 6\nhours before to 18 hours afterward.\n[10] Figure 2a shows the results of this process for four\nnormalized VELOX channels (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0 kHz); the\nthree normalized magnetic bay components H, D, and Z;\nand the corresponding three normalized Pi2 power compo-\nnents.

We\nrequired that these be \u2018\u2018random\u2019\u2019 but with a similar distri-\nbution in local time, season, etc. to the set of SCE epochs;\nfor this purpose we used the same set of epochs but shifted\n24 hours earlier. The result is shown in Figure 3. As\nexpected, there is a diurnal variation, but no effect is seen\nat t = 0.\n[11] In the final stage of the data analysis the median\ncurves of Figures 2 and 3 were \u2018\u2018unnormalized,\u2019\u2019 as\ndescribed by Smith et al. [1999], using the reciprocal of\nthe median of the scaling factors employed in performing\nthe normalization. This was done in order to restore the\noriginal units and provide a quantitative measure of the\nsubstorm effect. The results are shown in Figures 4a\u20134c for\nthe magnetic bay data and Figures 4d\u20134f for the Pi2 filtered\ndata and are summarized in the first row of Table 1. Each\npanel contains one curve derived from the SCE set of\nepochs and one from the reference set. The difference\nbetween the two approximates to the substorm effect, which\nwill be mainly from the DP1 (SCW) current system which\nswitches on at the substorm expansion phase onset but may\nalso include any substorm-related changes in DP2. The\nreference curve will have contributions from the DP2 and\nSq current systems ( plus a \u2018\u2018smeared out\u2019\u2019 DP1 contribution\naround the zero epoch from any substorms that might have\noccurred on the reference day). To quantify the Sq contri-\nbution we also plot in Figures 4a\u20134c quiet day curves\nobtained from the zero-meaned daily magnetic variations at\nHalley for the quietest day of each month (the international\nq1 day, Mayaud [1980]) from March 1994 to December\n1996, as provided by WDC-C2. The medians for these 21\ndays were detrended and shifted in time so that the 3 UT\npoints (the center of the 0200\u20130400 UT time interval\ncontaining the SCE epochs) were aligned with the origin\nof epoch time. The difference between the reference and Sq\ncurves approximately represents the DP2 effect (except\npossibly close to t = 0 where there may be the smeared\nFigure 3.

Superposed Epoch Analysis for a Midlatitude\nStation, L \u0002 2.5 (Faraday)\n[12] We repeated the analysis described above for Halley\nbut using magnetometer data from Faraday in three different\nlocal time ranges. The substorm epochs were however still\ntaken from the database of SCEs observed at Halley (there\nis no VELOX instrument at Faraday). The first time range\nanalyzed was 0200\u20130400 UT, i.e., the same as for the\nHalley study, when Faraday was in the premidnight local\ntime sector, at approximately 2130\u20132330 MLT. We used a\nset of 282 SCE epochs taken from our database, distributed\nthrough the years 1992\u20131996. The results are shown in\nFigure 5, displayed in the same format as Figure 4, and\nsummarized in Table 1. In a similar way to that described\nabove for Halley, quiet day curves have been added which\nFigure 4.

The quiet day curves labeled \u2018\u2018Sq\u2019\u2019 were derived\nas explained in section 3.2 and offset so as to coincide on average with the reference curves over the\nepoch time intervals 9\u201312 hours (for H and Z) and 15\u201318 hours (for D). These intervals correspond to\n0600\u20130900 MLT and 1200\u20131500 MLT, local times when the contributions of the Sq current system to\nthe reference curves are expected to be greatest relative to those of the DP2 system [Chapman and\nBartels, 1940].

In\nFigure 6 we present the results of a similar analysis using\n189 SCE epochs in the range 0300\u20130500 UT, when Fara-\nday was near local magnetic midnight (\u00022230\u20130030 MLT).\nFinally, Figure 7 shows the results for a set of 136 SCE\nFigure 5.

Discussion\n4.1. ELF\/VLF Substorm Signature\n[13] The upper four panels in Figure 2 represent the\nstatistical shape of the ELF\/VLF (chorus) response to a\nsubstorm, as observed at Halley when the station is close to\nmagnetic midnight. The pronounced rise close to the SCE\nepoch is of course a consequence of using the SCEs\nobserved in the ELF\/VLF data to define the epochs for\nthe superposed epoch analysis. We note in passing that this\nis a unique feature of the present work; previous studies of\nthe statistical magnetic signature of a substorm have used\ndifferent onset definitions; for example Caan et al. [1978]\nused the magnetic data themselves. We will not discuss the\nELF\/VLF results further, other than to note that the effect in\nthe 3.0 kHz channel is delayed \u000210 min relative to that in\nthe 1.5 kHz channel used to identify the epoch and that this\nprovides an estimate of \u00020.15 kHz\/min for the typical\nfrequency dispersion df\/dt of the leading edge of an SCE.\nThus by extrapolation the actual substorm onset may be\nestimated to occur up to \u000210 min prior to the epoch time,\nand this is probably a reasonable estimate of the uncertainty\nin the time of the substorm expansion phase onset when\nestimated from the SCE [Smith et al., 1999].\n4.2. Magnetic Bay Signature\n4.2.1. Model\n[14] We will discuss the magnetic bay response at both\nHalley and Faraday in terms of the well-known three-\ndimensional substorm current wedge (SCW) model in\nwhich downward and upward field-aligned currents, linking\nto the tail of the magnetosphere, close in the ionosphere\nforming the westward electrojet current [e.g., McPherron et\nal., 1973].\n[15] The magnetic field perturbations observed on the\nground (dH, dD, dZ ) from a SCW were worked out by\nKisabeth and Rostoker [1977]. Here we use a formulation of\nthe model which has been implemented at the University of\nYork as part of a modeling package to derive SCW location\nFigure 6. Similar to Figure 5 but for a set of 189 SCE epochs in the range 0300\u20130500 UT (2230\u20130030\nMLT). The vertical scales are the same as in Figure 5.\nSMP 14 - 8 SMITH ET AL.: VLF, MAGNETIC, AND PI2 SUBSTORM SIGNATURES\nand current growth from midlatitude magnetometer data\n[Cramoysan et al., 1995]. The SCW is modeled as a pair of\nfield-aligned currents flowing along dipole field lines,\nconnected in the ionosphere by a westward electrojet and\nin the tail with the equatorial ring current. The field\nperturbations are computed at the surface of the earth which\nis represented as a sphere with a two-layer (i.e., one-\ndimensional) conductivity structure comprising a surface\nresistive layer overlying a superconducting core. Both the\nionospheric and ground conductivities are assumed to be\nlaterally isotropic. Maps of the ground magnetic field\nvariations were presented by Cramoysan et al. [1995] (dH\nand dD) and Bunting [1995] (dZ). The dZ variation at\nmidlatitude, which we discuss below, has been little con-\nsidered in the literature. This is probably because the\nvertical variations can be suppressed by ground-induced\ncurrents in a homogeneous conductivity region or enhanced\nby local and regional conductivity structures.\n[16] In the top row of panels in Figure 8 we present maps\nin MLT versus magnetic latitude coordinates of the modeled\ndH, dD, dZ in the Northern Hemisphere due to a current\nwedge 3 hours wide in MLT [O\u2019Pray, 1998] with an\nelectrojet at 67\u0001 latitude (the most probable latitude accord-\ning to Liou et al. [2001]). The field perturbations for a 1 MA\ncurrent and static geometry are shown in nT by the quasi-\nlogarithmic scale. The next row is the corresponding set of\nplots for the Southern Hemisphere. In the bottom two rows\nthe contributions of the electrojet and field-aligned currents\nto the Southern Hemisphere perturbations are shown sepa-\nrately. It is clear (as would be expected) that at points far\nfrom the electrojet, in either latitude or local time, its\ncontribution is generally smaller than that of the field-\naligned currents. Figure 8 is for just one choice of SCW\nparameters, whereas our data plots represent sets of sub-\nstorms for which the electrojet latitude and MLT of the\ncentral meridian will vary from event to event.\n4.2.2. Auroral Zone Signature at Halley\n[17] We have derived the statistical shape and median\namplitude, in H, D, Z, of the substorm magnetic bay at\nHalley (Figures 4a\u20134c and Table 1), namely a negative H,\nFigure 7. Similar to Figure 5 but for a set of 136 SCE epochs in the range 0500\u20130700 UT (0030\u20130230\nMLT). The vertical scales are the same as in Figure 5.\nSMITH ET AL.: VLF, MAGNETIC, AND PI2 SUBSTORM SIGNATURES SMP 14 - 9\npositive D, negative Z bay (dH \u2019 \u000185 nT; dD \u2019 +50 nT; dZ\n\u2019 \u0001100 nT). This is very similar to that published by Smith\net al. [1999] (their Figure 6) who used a different but\noverlapping set of 258 SCE epochs between 1992 and\n1995. The similarity is expected statistically but does\nconfirm that the results are repeatable. The negative dH\nand dZ perturbations indicate a westward equivalent iono-\nspheric current (electrojet), lying slightly to the south\nFigure 8. (a\u2013c) Maps of dH, dD and dZ (north, east, and down components of magnetic perturbation)\nfor the University of York SCW model (see text for details). Positive values, represented by yellows and\nreds of the quasi-logarithmic color scale, are separated by a solid black curve from negative values,\nrepresented by blues and purples. The horizontal dashed line marks the latitude of the westward\nelectrojet (67\u0001) and the vertical dotted lines indicate the meridians of the field-aligned currents, at \u00b11.5\nhours MLT relative to the central meridian of the SCW.

The ratio of the dH and dZ medians at Halley are consistent with a station \u00021.5 degrees\nequatorward of the electrojet, i.e., latitude 65.5\u0001 for the electrojet shown here (Halley\u2019s actual magnetic\nlatitude is \u000262\u0001). The behavior at Faraday (\u000250\u0001) is represented by the lower latitude boundary of the\nplots.

The positive dD may be the\nresult of a tendency of the center of the current wedge to be\nearlier in local time than the observing station, i.e., premid-\nnight in this case; though Smith et al. [1999] attributed it to\na local effect at Halley in which the electrojet current had a\nslight geomagnetically southward component [Boteler,\n1978]. The substorm effect is smaller than in the example\nof Figure 1d because it includes the effects of many events,\nmost of which may be smaller (owing to a weaker or more\ndistant electrojet current) than the example. Of interest is the\nsecondary peak at t \u2019 2.5 hours, evidence of the tendency of\nsubstorms to recur on this timescale [e.g., Borovsky et al.,\n1993]; this is also seen clearly in Figure 9, described below.\n[18] The reference and sce curves diverge \u000230 min prior\nto t = 0; this is more than the \u000210 min uncertainty in the\nonset time and is interpreted as an enhancement in the DP2\ncurrent system prior to the substorm expansion phase onset.\nThere is a short levelling of the curves (inflection), in H and\nZ and possibly also D, just before onset. This feature was\nfound and noted in the AL index by Caan et al. [1978] but\nnot explained. It could be due to the auroral fading phe-\nnomenon [Kauristie et al., 1997] or the effect on DP2 of\nreduced convection associated with a northward turning of\nthe interplanetary magnetic field which could occur prior to\nthe triggering of a substorm [Lyons et al., 2001].\n[19] As implied above, it is difficult to be sure how much\nof the difference between the \u2018\u2018sce\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018ref\u2019\u2019 curves is\nFigure 9.

The\ndotted and dashed curves are the Weimer pulse waveforms at exp(\u0001pt) for p = 2 h\u00011 and p = 4 h\u00011,\nrespectively, normalized by choosing a = ep.

The dotted and dashed curves are the normalized Weimer pulse waveforms for\np = 2 h\u00011 and p = 4 h\u00011, respectively (H ) and p = 1.5 h\u00011 and p = 2 h\u00011, respectively (D and Z ).\nSMITH ET AL.: VLF, MAGNETIC, AND PI2 SUBSTORM SIGNATURES SMP 14 - 11\ndue to DP1, though any changes at t = 0 such as the\ngradient enhancement in H and Z will be. In order to focus\non the time dependence of the substorm effect, we plot in\nFigure 9 the normalized difference between the \u2018\u2018sce\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018ref\u2019\u2019 variations. In Figure 9a, for example, the Halley H,\nD and Z \u2018\u2018sce\u2019\u2019-\u2018\u2018ref\u2019\u2019 differences (solid curves) are nor-\nmalized to 1 at their greatest absolute values (which occur\nat t \u0002 20\u201330 min). An interesting feature is the faster\nrecovery to the presubstorm levels in the D component\ncompared with H and Z. This may be analyzed in terms of\nthe \u2018\u2018Weimer pulse\u2019\u2019 waveform [Weimer, 1994]: at\nexp(\u0001pt), normalized Weimer pulses for p = 2 h\u00011 and\np = 4 h\u00011 are shown as dotted and dashed curves in the\nfigure. It appears that p = 2 h\u00011 is a good fit to the H and Z\ndata, while p = 4 h\u00011 fits the D variation better. In his\nsuperposed epoch analysis of the AL index substorm bay,\nWeimer [1994] also found p = 2 h\u00011 to give the best fit. The\nwaveform was the solution to a second-order differential\nequation describing the impulsive response of the current\n(and hence ground magnetic perturbation) in an electrical\ncircuit similar to the SCW, in which p = \u00011\/2RC where C\nis the capacitance of the SCW and R is the ionospheric\nresistance. If the geometry of the SCW and its position\nrelative to the observing station remained constant during\nthe substorm, a decaying current in the wedge would be\nexpected to affect all components with the same time\nconstant. The fact that this is not observed may be because\nthe geometry is changing.\n[20] A possible explanation can be proposed in the\ncontext of Figure 8. The initial perturbation in D at Halley\nis positive, which indicates that it was initially equatorward\nof the electrojet and eastward of its center. If the station was\njust equatorward of the electrojet and the current wedge was\nwidening during the recovery phase, the station would\neffectively be moving closer to the center of the wedge,\ntoward a smaller D perturbation (contours run approxi-\nmately north\u2013south), thus giving a faster relaxation rate\nfor the D component as observed. In contrast, the effect of\nthe relative motion would be small on H and Z (contours run\napproximately east\u2013west).\n4.2.3. Midlatitude Signature at Faraday\n[21] In a similar fashion to that described above for\nHalley we have derived the statistical shape and median\namplitude, in H, D, Z, of the substorm magnetic bay at\nFaraday but now for three different local magnetic time\nranges: premidnight, midnight, and postmidnight (Figures\n5a\u20135c, 6a\u20136c, and 7a\u20137c, respectively, and Table 1). The\nthree cases are more closely spaced than those considered\nby Caan et al. [1978] who presented results for dawn, noon,\ndusk, and midnight.\n[22] The premidnight substorm magnetic bay response,\nshown in Figures 5a\u20135c, is naturally much smaller than at\nthe near-auroral station and is positive in H and negative in\nD (dH \u2019 +8 nT; dD \u2019 \u000112 nT). This is the expected\nbehavior for a midlatitude ground station on the westward\nside of the center of the substorm current wedge [Rostoker\net al., 1980] and is consistent with Figure 8. H begins to\nchange close to onset as expected, but D appears to diverge\nfrom the reference curve \u00021 hour earlier, most likely owing\nto enhancement of the DP2 current system during the\nsubstorm growth phase. Note that this midlatitude DP2\nsignature is opposite to what one might expect at auroral\nlatitudes for equatorward flow out of polar cap [Chapman\nand Bartels, 1940].\n[23] There is then a gradient change in D at t = 0,\nimmediately preceded by an \u2018\u2018inflection point\u2019\u2019 similar to\nthat seen in the Halley H and Z components (see above).\nSince Faraday is distant from the auroral zone, this may\nfavor the explanation in terms of the IMF northward turn-\ning. This is because a northward turning of the IMF would\nbe expected to reduce the DP2 current globally, whereas\nauroral fading would reduce the DP2 current only locally in\nthe auroral zone.\n[24] The clear long-lived (\u00025 hours) negative Z bay (dZ\n\u2019 \u00017 nT) begins at onset. Rostoker [1972] suggested that\nthe Z-component bay at midlatitudes is mostly due to the\nwestward electrojet, but Figures 8i and 8l imply that the\ncontribution from the field-aligned segments of the current\nwedge is as great, though both produce a negative Z\nperturbation (upward in the Northern Hemisphere and\ndownward in the Southern Hemisphere). The model cor-\nrectly predicts that the midlatitude jdHj and jdZj are of\ncomparable magnitude. For example at \u000150\u0001 latitude near\nthe western FAC meridian, Figures 8d and 8f show both to\nbe \u000210 nT.\n[25] In Figure 9b we compare the observed normalized\nbay data with a normalized Weimer pulse as we did for\nHalley. In this case the D component curve fits the wave-\nform well with p = 2 h\u00011. As for H and Z in the near-\nauroral zone case, this may represent the effect of the\ncurrent decay alone, since in Figure 8a the D contours\nare roughly east\u2013west at low latitudes near the meridian of\nthe westward field-aligned current. In contrast, the H and Z\ncontours are more nearly north\u2013south, and a geometrical\ncontribution from a changing configuration due to eastward\nmotion of the observing station in local time, and\/or\nexpansion of the wedge, would be expected. This would\nlead to a slower recovery, as observed for Z ( p = 1.5 h\u00011)\nbut not H ( p = 4 h\u00011).\n[26] The near-midnight study (Figure 6) shows similar\nfeatures to the premidnight case, with positive H and\nnegative Z bays (dH \u2019 +6 nT; dZ \u2019 \u00017 nT) beginning at\nonset, and a negative D bay (dD \u2019 \u00017 nT) beginning earlier\nand showing only a slight gradient change at t = 0. The\nsimilarity is perhaps not surprising, given the 50% overlap\nin the UT intervals in the two cases, and a difference of only\n1 hour in MLT. The H and Z bays are similar in size to the\npremidnight case, consistent with the model of Figure 8\nwhich shows that dH and dZ vary little within the current\nwedge at midlatitudes. On the other hand the size of the D\nbay is about half that of the premidnight dD, consistent with\na change to an observation point nearer to, but slightly west\nof, the central meridian. As in the premidnight case, part of\nthe bay may be due to an enhanced DP2 current rather than\nentirely DP1. A comparison with the normalized Weimer\nfunction (not shown) is less clear than for premidnight\nbecause of the poorer signal-noise ratio of the bay; however\nit does not appear to show any significantly different\nbehavior from Figure 9b.\n[27] In the post-midnight case (Figure 7) the trends from\npremidnight to near midnight are continued. The H bay has\nbecome even smaller and is barely seen above the noise\n(dH ] +2 nT). This may indicate that the observing station\nis located outside the substorm current wedge, near the\nSMP 14 - 12 SMITH ET AL.: VLF, MAGNETIC, AND PI2 SUBSTORM SIGNATURES\neastern edge of the low-latitude positive H region (Figure\n8); however this would not explain why the Z bay\ncontinues to be observed and is in fact now the dominant\ncomponent (dZ \u2019 \u00018 nT). There is now little evidence of a\nDP1 contribution to dD (no gradient change at t = 0 and no\nminimum at t \u0002 +30 min), whereas the model would\npredict an increase in jdDj from the center to the edge of\nthe SCW.\n4.3. Pi2 Signature\n4.3.1. Halley\n[28] We have derived the statistical shape and median\nRMS amplitude of the power in the 40\u2013150 s (7\u201325 mHz)\nPi2 band at Halley (Figures 4d\u20134f and Table 1). Referred to\nthe reference curves, this is largest in the H component and\nbegins about an hour before the SCE onset, peaking almost\nexactly at onset in H and D with an RMS amplitude of dH \u2019\n1.2 nT and dD \u2019 0.6 nT. The Z component is the smallest\n(dZ \u2019 0.3 nT) and peaks \u000230 min later.\n[29] Comparing Figures 4a\u20134c with Figures 4d\u20134f, we\nsee that in contrast to the lower latitude Pi2 response\ndiscussed below, there is a close correspondence\/propor-\ntionality between the magnetic H, D, Z perturbations from\nthe reference curves (which have effectively been bandpass-\nfiltered between 1 day\u00011 and 1 min\u00011) and the correspond-\ning wave power in the Pi2 frequency band. Furthermore, the\nPi2 wave power increases prior to the SCE epoch. These\nobservations indicate that wave power in the Pi2 frequency\nband at this near-auroral location of Halley is primarily part\nof a broader band wave spectrum in which the power in the\nlower frequencies is related to the power in the Pi2\nfrequency band. This is consistent with the perturbations\narising from the power law spectrum of a turbulent scale-\nfree DP2 electrojet current [e.g., Weimer et al., 1985].\n[30] The close relationship between the low-frequency\nand Pi2 band behavior is broken slightly near substorm\nonset where the Pi2 amplitude in the H and D components\npeaks immediately after the SCE epoch whereas the low-\nfrequency bay signature peaks slightly later at t = 20\u201330\nmin, the end of the substorm expansion phase. Thus there\nappears to be a secondary, narrow-band Pi2 component that\nis likely associated with the formation of the DP1 electrojet\ncurrent during the substorm expansion phase.\n4.3.2. Faraday\n[31] In a similar fashion to that described above for\nHalley we have derived the statistical shape and median\nRMS amplitude of the power in the 40\u2013150 s (7\u201325 mHz)\nPi2 band at Faraday for the three different local magnetic\ntime ranges (Figures 5d\u20135f, 6d\u20136f, and 7d\u20137f, respec-\ntively, and Table 1).\n[32] For the premidnight case (Figures 5d\u20135f), the 40\u2013\n150 s intensity results show the classic midlatitude Pi2\nresponse [Saito et al., 1976], peaking at RMS amplitudes of\n\u00020.1 nT in all three components (about a tenth of the size of\nthe corresponding peak at Halley). In contrast to Halley,\nthere is no increase before onset, and the peak has a duration\n(<1 hour) that is shorter than the bay, consistent with a\ndominant contribution from a substorm associated Pi2\npulsation burst occurring at the expansion phase onset.\n[33] Near midnight (Figures 6d\u20136f ) the 40\u2013150 s Pi2\nintensity is somewhat smaller (see Table 1), and for the\npost-midnight case (Figure 7d\u20137f ) it is smaller still. The\nprogressively decreasing Pi2 powers seen with increasing\nMLT suggest a center of activity biased to the evening side\nof midnight (see Sutcliffe [1980] who found that Pi2s at\nHermanus were most likely to be seen when the SCW was\ncentered 40\u0001 to the east of the station); alternatively, the\nresult may imply preferred propagation of the Pi2 pulsations\ntoward the evening local time sector.\n5. Summary and Conclusions\n[34] In this paper we have extended the work of Smith et\nal. [1999] to determine the \u2018\u2018typical\u2019\u2019 (or median) magnetic\nbay and Pi2 substorm responses at near-auroral and mid-\nlatitude ground stations (Halley and Faraday stations,\nrespectively) over a large number (100\u2013300) of substorms.\nThe method is based upon a superposed epoch analysis,\nwith sets of epochs of substorm expansion phase onset\ntaken from a database of substorm chorus events (SCEs)\nobserved by the VELOX VLF\/ELF receiver at Halley. The\nspatial and temporal properties of the magnetic bay sub-\nstorm signature are compared against a University of York\nvariant of the Kisabeth and Rostoker [1977] substorm\ncurrent wedge model and the Weimer [1994] pulse model,\nrespectively. This has produced the following results:\n1. The observed spatial variation of the DP1 component\nof the median substorm magnetic bay signature can be\nexplained by the York model for a SCW 3 hours wide in\nlocal time, centered slightly before midnight MLT, and\nwestward electrojet at latitude 67\u0001. This model thus remains\na useful framework within which to interpret substorm\nsignatures, even though a recent study by Weimer [2001]\nhas shown that the actual distribution of field-aligned\ncurrents, and hence horizontal currents, is more complex.\n2. The rarely discussed Z component of the substorm\nmagnetic bay signature is shown to be well-defined and\nsimilar to that expected by the York SCW model. It is\ncommonly the clearest and largest DP1 signature at Halley\nand Faraday.\n3. The York SCW model does not predict the absence of\na gradient change in D at onset or the dominance of the Z\ncomponent in the postmidnight MLT sector. Presumably, a\nmore sophisticated model is required to explain these\npostmidnight observations.\n4. The temporal shape of the DP1 component of the\nmagnetic bay substorm signature fits a normalized Weimer\npulse well. The decay rate of the H and Z components at\nHalley and the D component at Faraday is p = 2 h\u00011 and\nmatches that found byWeimer [1994] for the AL index. This\nis interpreted in terms of a decaying current in the wedge.\nHowever, the recovery time constants are different for dD at\nHalley ( p = 4 h\u00011) and for dH ( p = 4 h\u00011) and dZ ( p = 1.5\nh\u00011) at Faraday. The former two are postulated to be due to\nan additional geometrical contribution, arising from a\nchanging wedge configuration relative to the observing\nstation (possibly widening during the recovery phase). The\nlatter cannot be understood qualitatively in the same terms.\n5. A secondary bay in the superposed epoch plots at\nabout t = 2.5 hours confirms the tendency of substorms to\nrepeat with this period.\n6. The amplitude of the DP2 component of the magnetic\nbay substorm signature is comparable with that of the DP1\ncomponent. The DP2 component is predominantly in H and\nSMITH ET AL.: VLF, MAGNETIC, AND PI2 SUBSTORM SIGNATURES SMP 14 - 13\nZ at Halley at midnight MLT and in D at Faraday between\n2230 and 0230 MLT. It is enhanced \u000240 min prior to\nsubstorm onset.\n7. An inflection point in H and Z at Halley is seen just\nprior to onset. This could be related to auroral fading or\nreduced convection associated with northward turning of\nthe IMF. The same inflection point is seen in D at Faraday,\nprobably favoring the latter explanation.\n8. The median substorm signature at Halley in the Pi2\nfrequency band (7\u201325 mHz) appears to be related to the bay\nstructure, implying that it is part of a broad band turbulent\nspectrum in the substorm-dependent DP2 current, though\nthere is evidence of an additional minor narrow band\ncomponent occurring at substorm onset.\n9. At Faraday we see the classic midlatitude substorm\nsignature: a short Pi2 pulsation burst at onset. The observed\nPi2 power decreases progressively with increasing local\ntime, possibly implying a source region biased to the\nevening side or else preferred propagation to the west from\na near-midnight source.\n10. The typical frequency dispersion of the leading edge\nof an SCE is df\/dt \u00020.15 kHz\/min; the SCE-inferred\nsubstorm onset time can be estimated to an accuracy of \u000210\nmin or better.\n[35] Acknowledgments.
