During this time George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) has remained relatively intact, but is now reaching its \ntheoretical limit of viability. Epishelf lakes, formed when ice shelves dam the mouths of marine embayments, accumulate \nsediments that can be used to constrain past ice-shelf behaviour. They are stratified water bodies with an upper layer of \nfresh melt-water overlying a marine layer of water. Multi-proxy analysis of a sediment core from Moutonn\u00e9e Lake, an \nepishelf lake dammed by GVIIS on the east coast of Alexander Island, has recently shown that it retreated to at least the \nAblation Point area in the early Holocene, c. 9600-7500 yr BP, demonstrating its vulnerability to periods of atmospheric \nand oceanic warmth.  This study tests this interpretation of ice-shelf collapse through detailed analyses of granulometric, \ngeochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for >8 mm clasts from the same cores. Clast data from Moutonn\u00e9e \nLake were compared with geological reference data from two further lakes on Alexander Island (Ablation Lake and \nCitadel Bastion Lake) and an extensive archive of rocks and isotope geochemical provenance data from the Antarctic \nPeninsula region. Underpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic\/igneous outcrops in Palmer \nLand on the western side and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of George VI \nSound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonn\u00e9e Lake during periods of ice shelf \npresence and absence.  Results show that changes in clast distribution and provenance reflect the early Holocene retreat \nand reformation of George VI Ice Shelf at Moutonn\u00e9e Lake. The period of ice shelf retreat was marked by the onset of \nmarine conditions in the basin followed by a rapidly deposited zone of clasts whose provenance, distribution, varied \nlithology and larger than average clast size are indicative of a period of lake-ice disintegration and ice-rafted debris \ndeposition between c. 9600-8450 yr BP. Igneous clasts in the ice-rafted debris have a close affinity with the plutonic \nprovinces of western Palmer Land suggesting transport to the site by icebergs or recycling through Alexander Island \nstrata\/moraines. When epishelf lake conditions returned after c. 7500 yr BP, the clasts were smaller, the number of \nlithologies more limited and the assemblage dominated by olive-green vitric tuff and pale-green rhyolitic clasts that \nisotope data link to Early Cretaceous volcanic activity in Palmer Land. Their dominance in the upper part of the core \nmost likely relates to increased erosion of Palmer Land ash\/tuffs from volcanic outcrops on the floor of Moutonn\u00e9e \nValley and implies a downturn in climate after c. 7500 yr BP and the reformation of George VI Ice Shelf.  \n2 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n1. Introduction \nRecent atmospheric warming across the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region has been substantially greater than both the \ncurrent global mean and the natural temperature variability of the Holocene (Scambos et al., 2000; Vaughan et al., 2003; \nDomack et al., 2005). As a result, substantial volumes of ice have been lost from unconfined ice shelves (Fig. 1) (King et \nal., 2004). This process has led to accelerated glacier flow into the ocean, which contributes to raising global sea-levels \n(De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003; Scambos et al., 2004). Assessing the past stability of ice shelves on the AP improves our \nunderstanding of how the remaining ice shelves will respond to continued warming of the region predicted by many \nclimate models (Houghton, 2001; De Angelis and Skvarca, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2003). \n \nGeorge VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) is the largest remaining ice shelf on the western side of the AP (Fig. 1). It is c. 500 km long, \n20-60 km wide and 100-500 m thick and confined within George VI Sound (70o-73o S, 68o-72o W) by Alexander Island \nto the west and Palmer Land to the east. Unlike most Peninsula ice shelves that have recently disintegrated, its \nconfinement provides additional stability (Smith et al., in press). On the eastern coast of Alexander Island, GVIIS \nimpounds two epishelf lakes, Moutonn\u00e9e and Ablation (Fig. 2). In Antarctica, epishelf lakes form when ice shelves dam \nmarine embayments. Moutonn\u00e9e Lake is a tidal, stratified water body with a lower marine layer that extends under the ice \nshelf to the ocean and an upper fresh melt-water layer whose maximum thickness is determined by the draught of the ice \nshelf (Heywood, 1977; Smith et al., 2006). Smith et al. (2006) proposed that when the ice-shelf is absent, Moutonn\u00e9e \nLake would become a marine embayment (Fig. 3). Therefore, epishelf lakes can be used to constrain past ice-shelf \nbehaviour because when the ice-shelf retreats marine sediments with a distinctive biological and isotopic signature are \ndeposited.  \n \nThe recent loss of the Larsen Ice-shelf B (LIS-B) is unique in the present Holocene interglacial (Domack et al., 2005). \nHowever, other ice shelves are behaving, and have behaved differently with evidence for retreat events in the mid and \nearly Holocene (Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Brachfeld et al., 2003; Bentley et al., 2005; Cook et al., 2005). For example, \nBentley et al. (2005) and Smith et al. (2006) showed that GVIIS retreated to at least the Ablation Point area in the early \nHolocene, c. 9595-7495 yr BP, immediately post-dating the early Holocene climatic optimum identified in ice core \nrecords (Masson et al., 2000; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2004), and occurring at the same time as an influx of warmer ocean \nwater onto the AP continental shelf (Domack et al., 2001; Bentley et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2006). It is thought that \nstructural instability and collapse of unconfined ice shelves such as Larsen Ice Shelf B and C followed a build up of \nsuperficial meltwater ponding, with increased lateral stress leading to rapid removal of large sections of the ice shelf \n(Doake et al., 1998). In contrast, superficial ponding has been observed for decades on GVIIS, and although regional \ntemperatures have risen to its hypothesised viability limit, it has remained relatively stable with only minor retreat \n3 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nrecorded at its northern margin since 1985 (Fig. 4) (Vaughan and Doake, 1996). Thus, a combination of oceanic melting \nof the under-side of the ice shelf and increases in atmospheric temperature at the surface may be necessary for further \nretreat of GVIIS beyond present day limits (Shepherd et al., 2003; Bentley et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2006).  \n \nThe aim of this study is to examine the geological evidence for past retreat of GVIIS through detailed analyses of \ngranulometric, geochemical and Sr and Nd isotope provenance data for clasts retained on an 8 mm sieve (i.e. the >8 mm \nfraction) in a sediment core from Moutonn\u00e9e Lake. We compare data from Moutonn\u00e9e Lake with geological reference \ndata from two other lakes on the eastern side of Alexander Island, Ablation Lake and Citadel Bastion Lake, and an \nextensive archive of rocks and geological provenance reference data from the AP region. Specific objectives are to \ndetermine if the granulometric and geochemical characteristics of the clasts can be used: (1) as an indicator of initial \nand\/or final provenance, (2) as a proxy record for GVIIS collapse and\/or reformation and (3) as an indicator of major \nchanges in glacial activity in the lake-catchment. \n \nUnderpinning this provenance analysis is the contrast between the plutonic\/igneous outcrops in Palmer Land on the \nwestern side of George VI Sound and the predominantly sedimentary strata of Alexander Island on the eastern side of \nGeorge VI Sound, and the different patterns in their deposition that would be expected at Moutonn\u00e9e Lake during periods \nof ice shelf presence versus periods of ice-shelf absence.  At present, locally derived clasts enter Moutonn\u00e9e Lake mainly \nby glacial erosion of catchment bedrock or moraines, and possibly even aeolian transport (cf. Lewis et al., 2002; Gilbert \nand Domack, 2003).  A smaller number of exotic clasts are also transported englacially through GVIIS from Palmer Land \nand become embedded in the lake ice margin or deposited via a local lake ice conveyor along the lake shoreline \n(Clapperton and Sugden, 1982; Potter and Paren, 1985; Hendy, 2000; Bentley et al., 2005; Smith et al., in press). When \nthe ice-shelf was absent in the early Holocene, the lake would have become a marine embayment. The main conclusion \nfrom this study is that during this period of ice-shelf absence a greater number of exotic clasts were deposited in the \nembayment by lake-ice disintegration and iceberg rafting processes.  \n \n2. Site descriptions \n2.1 Moutonn\u00e9e Lake  \nMoutonn\u00e9e Lake (70o 52.123' S, 68o 19.635' W) is an epishelf lake impounded by GVIIS and located in a valley on the \neast coast of Alexander Island (Fig. 2a). The geology and geomorphology of the area are well-mapped, with catchment \nglaciers currently located c. 2 km up the valley (Fig. 2) (e.g., Horne, 1968; Elliott, 1975; Clapperton and Sugden, 1983; \nButterworth, 1991; Browne, 1996). At Moutonn\u00e9e Lake, GVIIS is grounded on a partially submerged bedrock bar \ndamming the embayment (Figs. 2b, 3). However the lake retains a limited hydraulic connection to the seawater in George \n4 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nVI Sound as revealed by the offset tidal regime that occurs in the lake (Pearson and Rose, 1983). At present, freshwater \noverlies seawater with a halocline at c. 30 m depth (Heywood, 1977; Smith et al., 2006). We examined the principal core, \nML, extracted from the deepest point of the main basin with a water depth of 51 m.  \n \nA conceptual model has shown that when the ice shelf is present exotic clasts can be transported across George VI Sound \nfrom the igneous provinces of western Palmer Land by becoming incorporated into the ice-shelf and then the lake ice \n(Fig. 3) (Smith et al., 2006). Bishop and Walton (1981) and Pearson and Rose (1983) demonstrated the existence of a \nstrong south-east to north-west flow regime from the region south of the Bertram Glacier in western Palmer Land in the \ndirection of Ablation Point (Fig. 4). Clapperton and Sugden (1982) and Smith et al. (2006) also noted the presence of \ngranitic clasts in the moat surrounding Moutonn\u00e9e Lake, showing that transport of material across GVIIS had occurred at \nsome point, likely due to the existence of a lake-ice conveyor similar to that described in Hendy (2000). The ice-shelf at \nboth Moutonn\u00e9e Lake and Ablation Lake (AB) is not continuously grounded. Processes similar to those occurring at \nMoutonn\u00e9e Lake are likely to have occurred at Ablation Lake. \n \n2.2 Reference data sets \nAblation Lake and Citadel Bastion Lake \nAblation Lake (70o 48.974' S, 68o 27.143 W) has a similar setting to Moutonn\u00e9e, but differs in that GVIIS is only \npartially grounded across the entrance to the embayment. This results in a continuous hydraulic connection to the \nseawater in George VI sound as revealed by an in-phase tidal regime occurring in the lake (Smith et al., in press). Due to \nthe absence of a bedrock barrier GVIIS penetrates into the basin forming an ice-shelf tongue (Fig. 2b: H) and can directly \ndeposit coarse sediments into the lake.  We examined the principal Ablation Lake core, henceforth referred to as AB, \nextracted from a water depth of 65 m.   \n \nCitadel Bastion Lake (72\u00b0 00.549\u2019 S, 068\u00b0 27.708\u2019 W) (Fig 1) is located on the eastern side of Alexander Island, south of \nand further inland than Moutonn\u00e9e and Ablation Lakes. It is enclosed on three sides by Citadel Bastion and Corner Cliffs \nand dammed along its northern edge by the Saturn Glacier (Fig. 2c, d), which isolates it from George VI Sound. \nTherefore, it provides useful reference data for modes and types of local clast deposition that would be expected on \nAlexander Island at a site beyond the influence of the ice-shelf. There is no subglacial hydraulic connection to George VI \nSound and the Saturn Glacier prevents seawater encroaching into the embayment. We examined the principal core (CIB) \nextracted from a water depth of 89 m. \n \n5 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \n2.3 Geological reference data \nTo best interpret the provenance signals of clasts identified in the ML, AB and CIB cores, we examined previously \ncollected rocks and geological data from across Alexander Island and western Palmer Land. The AP is composed of Late \nJurassic to Early Cretaceous calc-alkaline igneous rocks and fore-arc and back-arc volcaniclastic sedimentary sequences. \nThe latter were formed by subduction of the Pacific and proto-Pacific beneath the AP along an active continental margin \nof Gondwana (Suarez, 1976; Saunders et al., 1980; Pankhurst, 1982; Pankhurst, 1990; Leat et al., 1995; Howe, 2003). \nVaughan and Storey (2000) proposed a terrane model to explain the formation and geology of the AP and the distinct \ngeological contrast that exists between the predominantly volcanic and plutonic bedrock of western Palmer Land and the \nsedimentary deposits of eastern Alexander Island (Fig. 4). The three principal terranes are: (1) the Western Domain, an \naccretionary, predominantly sedimentary terrane covering Alexander Island, (2) the Central Domain, a magmatic \nsubduction-related arc terrane exposed along the west coast of Palmer Land dominated by plutonic and volcanic outcrops \nand (3) the Eastern Domain, a cratonic margin terrane covering the east coast of Palmer Land, not relevant to this study. \nThe Western Domain of Alexander Island is separated from the Central and Eastern Domains by a rift zone that runs the \nlength of George VI Sound (Pearson and Rose, 1983; Bell and King, 1998).  \n \nThe plutonic and volcanic provinces of western Palmer Land and southern Graham Land were formed by magmatic \nactivity during the Mesozoic (Suarez, 1976; Leat et al., 1995; Storey et al., 1996; Howe, 2003). The Western Domain of \nAlexander Island formed in a fore-arc basin setting and is either a subduction\/accretion complex of the Central Domain or \na separate crustal fragment (Elliott, 1974; Vaughan and Storey, 2000). The bedrock in the catchment areas of the three \nlakes examined belongs to the Himalia Ridge Formation (Fig. 2b), part of the Fossil Bluff Group (FBG). The FBG is a \nfore arc sedimentary sequence, deposited during the Late Jurassic-Late Albian (c. 100 Ma) and outcropping along the \neastern coast of Alexander Island (Macdonald et al., 1993; Moncrieff and Kelly, 1993). It is predominantly sedimentary, \nand characterised by interbedded black mudstones\/siltstone, conglomerate, sedimentary breccia and arkosic sandstone \nstrata (Doubleday et al., 1993; Macdonald et al., 1993; Moncrieff and Kelly, 1993; Miller and Macdonald, 2004). The \nHimalia Ridge Formation, which outcrops around the Ablation Point area, is a 1100 m thick sequence dominated by \nmudstone and sporadic conglomerate beds (Doubleday et al., 1993; Doubleday, 1994). Thick fluvial and deltaic \nsequences and interspersed volcanic deposits are exposed in and around the catchments of the three lakes examined. \nThese were deposited unconformably during the Cretaceous on older metasediments of the Lemay Group and later \nuplifted, compressed and inverted during a mid-Cretaceous compression event. The FBG is largely devoid of igneous \nstrata because volcanic activity migrated northwards, away from the Fossil Bluff area (McCarron and Millar, 1997; \nHowe, 2003). \n \n6 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n3. Experimental Methods \n3.1 Rationale \nIn marine core studies, granulometric investigations are commonly undertaken on the >2 and\/or <2 mm fractions that \ndefine the boundary between sand and gravel (e.g., Pudsey et al., 1994; Pudsey, 2000; O Cofaigh et al., 2001; Pudsey and \nEvans, 2001; Anderson et al., 2002). The assumption that the >2 mm fraction is primarily ice-rafted debris (IRD) is valid \nin these studies because marine cores are often extracted far enough from terrestrial inputs to rule out other depositional \nmechanisms (Andrews and Principato, 2002).  \n \nIn this study, the >2mm fraction was subdivided into 2-8 mm and >8 mm fractions because:  \n(i) Research on modern lacustrine environments in Antarctica suggests that coarse sand, fine gravel and coarser sediments \nare commonly found embedded in floating lake ice, while silts and fine sands rain-out onto the lake floor after melting \nthrough the ice. For example, Hendy (2000) noted that clasts <10 mm in thickness will pass through the lake ice and rain \nout because the rate at which they absorb and retain radiation, and, therefore, the rate at which they melt through the lake \nice, is greater than the ablation rate of the lake-ice surface. That is, most individual clasts and clast aggregates >8 mm will \nremain embedded in the lake-ice.  Since few clasts of this size melt through the ice before break-up, increased \nconcentrations of clasts >8 mm in size and\/or changes in their lithology in the lake sediment should represent periods \nwhen lake ice break-up and ice-rafting events occur. \n(ii) Catchment glaciers probably calved periodically into the lakes (Clapperton and Sugden, 1982), allowing numerous 2-\n8 mm and >8 mm clasts to be transported into the lake by glacial and\/or glaciofluvial processes. At Ablation Lake  and \nCitadel Bastion Lake, catchment glaciers feed directly into the lake (Fig. 2b and 2c). In contrast, at Moutonn\u00e9e Lake there \nare no direct inputs from the glaciers in Moutonn\u00e9e Valley (Clapperton and Sugden, 1983) and any increase in >8 mm \nclast abundance and change in lithology would be most likely due to lake ice break-up and\/or ice rafting.  \n(iii) >8 mm clasts can be readily classified into specific lithological groups whose granulometric and geochemical \ncharacteristics are more diagnostic of transport mechanisms and provenance than finer fractions. \n(v) The >8 mm fraction is sufficiently abundant in all three cores for statistical analysis and clasts in this fraction provide \nsufficient material for standard analytical procedures (e.g., XRF, ICP-MS). \n \n3.1 Core extraction, clast separation and chronology \nCores were extracted using a UWITEC gravity corer (for surface sediments) and a 2 m UWITEC KOL \u2018Kolbenlot\u2019 cable-\noperated percussion piston corer (for deeper sediments) and transported frozen to the UK. Following a series of routine \ndescriptions and sedimentological analyses, sub-samples from each 1 cm of the cores were dried, weighed, re-suspended \n7 \nin water, placed in an ultrasound bath for 45 minutes and wet sieved through 8 mm, 2 mm and 63 \u03bcm meshes. This paper \nconcentrates on the >8 mm fraction. Detailed results of other sedimentological analyses including biological analyses of \nforaminifera, diatoms, geochemical and isotopic (\u03b4\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n18O, \u03b413Corg, TOC, NOC, C\/N) and physical analyses (magnetic \nsusceptibility) are described in Bentley et al. (2005) and Smith et al. (2006). \n \nClasts retained on the 8 mm sieve were grouped into lithological types on the basis of hand specimens and the \nrepresentative geochemical and isotopic analyses. In total, more than 1000 clasts were grouped, weighed, and their long, \nintermediate and short axes measured. The number of clasts examined from each lake is approximately three times \ngreater than the number of gravel clasts examined in comparable studies (e.g., Kuhn et al., 1993). Similarly, many of the \nlithological group and core zone divisions contain more than the 117 grains recommended for reliable statistical analysis \nin single-grain geochronology\/provenance studies (Vermeesch, 2004). \n \nFollowing recommendations in similar studies (Jones et al., 2000; Hodgson et al., 2004), monospecific marine \nforaminifera (Globocassidulina sp. and Cibicides sp.) and other macrofossils (e.g., plant remains and organic matter) \nwere handpicked, cleaned and radiocarbon dated (see Table 1 for full experimental details). When macrofossils were \nabsent, bulk surface sediments were dated on an exploratory basis to test the suitability of bulk sediment dating elsewhere \nin core (Table 1). Radiocarbon ages from marine organisms were calibrated to a calendar time scale using CALIB v4.4 \n(Stuiver and Reimer, 1993) and a \u0394R value of 900 yr (Table 1).  \n \n3.2 Geochemical and isotopic analysis \nMajor, trace and Nd and Sr isotope analyses were undertaken on 35 representative clast types from the Moutonn\u00e9e Lake \ncore (ML) and the Ablation (AB) Lake core. At the outset, major and trace element and isotope data were thought to be \ngood provenance indicators because of the macroscale differences in geology between Palmer Land and Alexander \nIsland. Criteria for sampling were: (1) best representation of lithological diversity, (2) lack of significant visible \nalteration, and (3) suitable size of clast. Most of the clasts analysed come from the ML core, reflecting the greater \ndiversity of clast types found in this core. Thin sections were made from all clasts prior to chemical analysis. For \ngeochemical and isotope analysis, the outer\/weathered surfaces were removed by grinding, the remaining sample crushed \nin a mini-rock splitter and ground by hand to a fine powder in a clean agate pestle and mortar. All crushing\/grinding \nequipment was rigorously cleaned between samples with acetone in an ultrasonic bath. Geochemical procedures are \nsummarised in relevant table captions. \n \n8 \nIt was not possible to date the clasts directly due to their limited size and\/or lack of suitable or sufficient phenocrysts. \nClast age estimates used in \u03b5Nd calculations were obtained from isochron analysis of bulk \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n87Sr\/86Sr vs 87Rb\/86Sr data, \nwhich was analysed using Isoplot (Ludwig, 2003). \u03b5Ndi values, representing the difference between the initial 143Nd\/144Nd \nratio of the clasts and that of the chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR) at the time of clast formation, were calculated \nusing age estimates from 87Sr\/86Sr vs 87Rb\/86Sr isochron analysis and compared with Palmer Land datasets of known age. \nInitial hand specimen groupings were improved by agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis of selected REE and \nisotopic data. Multivariate statistical analyses were used to compare new data with published Sr and Nd isotope data from \nPalmer Land. To aid interpretation of clast data, additional geochemical and isotope analysis was undertaken on the \npotentially far-travelled clay\/silt (<63 \u03bcm) sediment fraction from the ML core. Eighteen powdered samples were \nsubjected to the same geochemical\/isotope procedures as the clasts.  \n \n4. Stratigraphic results \n4.1 Core descriptions, stratigraphic units and chronology  \nThe sediment matrix in the ML core is uniformly light grey (2.5Y 3\/2-5\/2, 5YR 4\/1 and 10YR 3\/1) with no major visible \nvariations. A similar matrix was found in AB and CIB cores. The principal sedimentary facies in ML and AB are \nunstratified matrix- and clast-supported diamictons, fine mud with sporadic clasts, and sandy gravels. Clast-supported \ndiamictons are more prevalent in the AB core than the ML or CIB cores and are more common in the bottom half of the \nAB and ML cores.  The upper 30 cm of Zone 4 and the near surface 15-20 cm of all cores are dropstone muds\/fine muds. \nMacrofossils were only found in the ML cores.  \n \nML core: The ML core is divided into five principal units defined by the presence\/absence of marine organisms (Fig. 5). \nZone 1 is devoid of macro- and microfossils. Above this, Zone 2 (522-490 cm) is well defined by the appearance of \nmarine organisms (forams, diatoms, spicules and brachipod shell fragments). Zone 3 is devoid of biogenic organisms, but \ncharacterised by a greater-than-average number of randomly deposited clasts of various sizes and rock type. Organisms \nindicative of marine conditions reappear in Zone 4 (302-236 cm). In the uppermost unit if the core, Zone 5 (236-0 cm), \nmarine fossils are replaced by sporadic terrestrial organic matter and sparse moss fragments. \n \nAMS 14C ages from discrete macrofossils (mono-specific forams) in the ML core are in stratigraphic order (within 2\u03c3 \nerror). Calibrated AMS 14C foram ages from top of Zone 2 (9400\u00b140 and 9260\u00b1110 cal yr. B.P.) and the lower half of \nZone 4 (9400\u00b130; 9470\u00b130; 9430\u00b140 cal. yr. B.P.) are essentially coeval (Table 1; Fig. 5). This means that the clast-\ndominated Zones 2 & 3 and the lower half of Zone 4 were deposited rapidly, with Zones 2 and 3 deposited not long after \n9 \nthe onset of marine conditions. Zone 5 remains undated due to insufficient macrofossils and problems with \u2018old\u2019 \nradiocarbon ages from bulk sediments. Exploratory radiocarbon dating of bulk surface sediments from the ML core \nproduced a clearly erroneous age of 15100\u00b150 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n14C yr BP (Table 1). This substantial age offset is comparable in \nmagnitude with surface ages from other cores we have examined in this region (Table 1), and most likely due to sources \nof \u2018old\u2019 particulate organic carbon (POC) (e.g., lignite) present in the Fossil Bluff Group and\/or old carbon from glacial \nmeltwater (cf. Doran et al., 1999; Hendy and Hall, 2006). For these reasons we do not use bulk sediment 14C ages in \nconstructing chronologies for lake sediments from Alexander Island. \n \nAB core: The reference core, AB was subdivided into five principal lithofacies units (Fig. 5) using criteria in Evans and \nPudsey (2002).  The core consists of a matrix-supported diamicton (Unit I), gravelly mud and muddy gravels with \ninterbedded diamicton layers (Unit II), dropstone sandy mud and gravel (Unit III) and a matrix-supported diamicton (Unit \nIV) fining upwards into a virtually dropstone-free sandy mud near the surface (Unit V). An impenetrable deposit at c. 2.4 \nm prevented deeper coring, and, as a (likely) consequence, there is no evidence of the marine zones found in the longer \nML core. The absence of macro- and microfossils or extractable organic fractions and compounds prevented reliable \ndating of the AB core. Humin and bulk sediment ages from this core are considered unreliable due to the likelihood of \ncontamination from POC in the Fossil Bluff Group and\/or old carbon in glacial meltwater (Table 1). \n \nCIB core: The reference core, CIB consists of a silty-sandy mud with repetitious gravel deposits. It has been divided into \nfive units (A-E) defined by the principal changes in physical characteristics (grain size and magnetic susceptibility) and \norganic content. Some bulk and humin radiocarbon ages are stratigraphically consistent, but the \u2018old\u2019 bulk surface ages \nsuggest that contamination from old carbon sources also occurs at this site. Studies to refine this chronology using \noptically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic intensity dating methods are ongoing. Until then, we assume that \nthe core post-dates the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) because the Citadel Bastion area was most likely inundated by ice \nat the LGM. \n \n4.2 Clast distribution, density, shape and weathering characteristics  \nIn the ML core, the mean clast mass of Zone 1 (62.8\u00b157.4 g) is significantly larger than that of the other zones (Fig. 5). \nThere are, however, only four clasts in this zone and all statistics are heavily skewed by sandstone bedrock embedded in \nthe base of the core. Zone 2 (39 clasts; mean clast mass=18.9\u00b17.6 g, clast density 0.458 g cm-3 sediment) and the first 10 \ncm of Zone 3 (31; 8.92\u00b15.73 g; 0.229 g cm-3) have mean clast masses and densities that are significantly greater than \nelsewhere in the ML core (and both AB and CIB cores) (Fig. 5). Zone 3 has largest number of clasts per cm in the ML \n10 \ncore (1.53), consistent with rapid deposition suggested by the radiocarbon results. More significantly, these data show \nthat the largest clasts were deposited at the start of the marine incursion (Zone 2). Clast density and mean clast mass in \nZone 4 is significantly less than in other zones (0.026 g cm\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n-3\/3.05\u00b10.88 g respectively, cf. mean of 0.110 g cm-3\/5.73 \n\u00b10.87 g) suggesting a lower rate of deposition throughout Zone 4. A further reduction in clast density to 0.0151 g cm-3 of \nsediment between 268-236 cm suggests IRD deposition ceased approximately half way through this zone. Interestingly, \nthe top 17 cm of Zone 5 is similarly devoid of clasts. Indeed, the most notable similarity across all three cores is the near \ncomplete absence of clasts from the upper 15-20 cm. This could relate to a more recent reduction in clasts deposited from \ncatchment glaciers that have receded beyond the lake margins (Figs. 2, 5). \n \nThe clast assemblage in ML differs from that in AB and CIB in several ways. First, the AB core has the greatest mean \nclast density (0.1921 g cm-3) and mean clast mass (6.12\u00b10.58 g). The overall mean clast mass of the ML core is similar to \nthe AB core, but the clast density is significantly less, due to the lack of larger clasts (defined here as clasts >10 g) \nbetween 236-0 cm depth (Fig. 5). In contrast, the smaller proportion of glacially remoulded and striated clasts in the ML \ncore of 8 % compared to 31% in the AB core indicates that input of material from a subglacial or entrained glacial source \n(e.g. basal ice-shelf transportation) is more limited in the ML core. The greater proportion of striated mudstone and \nsiltstone (Group 14) clasts in the AB core most likely reflects the larger size and higher number of active glaciers present \nin Ablation Valley compared with the Moutonn\u00e9e Valley (Fig. 2b). Third, as might be expected, the AB core is \ndominated by clasts from proximal catchment glaciers and direct inputs from the ice shelf tongue that protrudes into the \nlake. Fourth, due to its isolation from GVIIS, the mean clast density of the CIB core (0.0213 g cm-3) is an order of \nmagnitude smaller than the AB and ML cores. This is primarily because the clasts are smaller (Fig. 5), but there is also a \nmarked reduction in the number of clasts per cm (ML=0.960, AB=1.580, CIB=0.75 clasts per cm) and clast density \n(ML=0.110 g cm-3, AB=0.192 g cm-3, CIB=0.0213 g cm-3). The overall mean clast mass in CIB is 1.43\u00b10.34 g (cf. \nML=5.73\u00b10.87 g, AB=6.12\u00b10.58 g) and only five clasts have a mass  greater than 10 g. Zone D is the only zone with a \nclast density >0.1 g cm-3 This zone is characterized by variable inputs of coarse\/fine sediments that are thought to reflect \nfluctuations in the position of the calving front of the catchment glaciers. \n \nClast shape and weathering characteristics in the ML core differ from the AB and CIB cores. Clasts in the ML core are \nangular to sub-angular (mean shape=1.8\u00b10.1; scale=0-6 where 0=very angular and 6=well-rounded) (Pettijohn et al., \n1987), i.e. less well rounded than the average clast from AB (2.5\u00b10.1) and CIB (2.6\u00b10.1) cores. This is because the first \n25 cm of Zone 3 has a large number of angular clasts, possibly representing clasts that were embedded in lake ice and \ndumped into the lake at the first opportunity with little or no recycling\/reworking through Alexander Island moraines. The \n11 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nhigher degree of angularity in Zone 5 is due to the large number of very angular\/angular olive green vitric tuff (Group 1) \nclasts (n=124; mean shape=1.2\u00b10.1). Clasts in AB and CIB are sub-angular to sub-rounded and have a roundness index \ngreater than average (2.5\u00b10.1 and 2.6\u00b10.04, respectively), possibly indicative of proportionately greater reworking or \nerosion from previously reworked deposits in the catchment strata (e.g. Fossil Bluff Group conglomerates).  \n \nOverall, the proportion of potentially subglacially\/ice shelf entrained, derived and\/or remoulded clast shapes (i.e. bladed \nor prolate clasts) remains fairly constant at 40-60% for all three cores and zones within the ML core. Clast shapes that \nmight represent significantly longer periods of basal entrainment, or perhaps through ice-shelf transport commonly \nconstitute 20-40%, with the largest percentage in all cores in marine Zone 4 of the ML core. There are more bladed clasts \nin the CIB core compared to the overall mean shape and the mean shapes for each core (CIB=21% vs ML=13%, \nAB=16%, All cores=16%). This is indicative, perhaps, of greater deposition of sediment entrained in the basal layers of \ncatchment glaciers.  \n \nIn the ML core 29% of mudstone clasts have multi-directional striations, suggesting multiple phases of glacial reworking \nbefore final deposition into the lake. The number of striated clasts is greatest in the AB core (31%) reflecting the \ndominance of Group 10\/14 mudstones\/siltstones (61% of all clasts) on which striations are more readily visible. \nNevertheless, a greater than average number of Group 10\/14 clasts are striated in the AB core (44% in AB compared 33% \noverall, 28 % in ML and 18% in CIB) (Table 2). The most significant pattern in the iron-oxide weathering statistics \n(Table 2) is that only 1% of clasts in the CIB core have visible iron-oxide weathering, far fewer than the ML and AB \ncores. \n \n4.3 Lithological groups and key changes in their distribution \nThirty-five clast groups were identified in the three sediment cores with significant lithological and distributional \ndifferences between them (Fig. 6; Table 2). To aid descriptions of provenance, we have presented clast data in three main \ncategories: primary igneous (plutonic and volcanic clasts), secondary igneous (volcanic clasts only) and non-igneous \n(sedimentary\/meta-sedimentary clasts) (Table 2). Primary igneous clasts are defined by >50% crystalline or tuffaceous \ncomposition. Tuffs in this category contain <10% lithic fragments. Secondary igneous clasts are lithic tuffs or tuffaceous \nsandstones with >50% reworked lithic component. Non-igneous clasts are sedimentary and\/or metamorphosed\/reworked \nsedimentary clasts. These are dominated by black mudstones, and dark grey and grey-white sandstones commonly found \nin the bedrock strata of the Fossil Bluff Group.  \n \n12 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nThere are 31 lithological groups represented in the ML core, with a maximum of 11 in any single 10 cm interval. The \nproportion of igneous and sedimentary clasts is almost equal when averaged over the whole core (50% and 45%, \nrespectively). The number of plutonic clasts is c. 3-5% throughout, perhaps indicating input from a constant, but \nrestricted source. However, general statistics mask significant differences in the distribution of clast types in the marine \n(Zones 2-4) and epishelf lake sediments (Zone 5). The majority of the clasts in marine zones (2 and 4) and in the marine \nIRD Zone 3 are sedimentary or meta-sedimentary. ML Zone 3 has the largest number of clast types (17 in total). The \nvolcanic clast component of >30% in Zones 2 and 3, rises significantly to >80% in Zone 5.  \n \nThere are three main shifts in clast distribution (Fig. 6: circled points 1-3). The most important of these is the shift in clast \nlithologies between Zones 3 and 5 (Fig. 6: circled points 1-2). In Zone 3, the clast assemblage is a mixture of fresh to \nhighly weathered crystal and lithic tuffs and sedimentary clasts. Zone 4 comprises a dropstone mud deposit with a low \nproportion of volcanic clasts (21% volcanic clasts compared to a core average of 50%). The clast assemblage in epishelf \nlake sediments of Zone 5 is dominated (63%) by Group 1\/7 fresh olive green vitric tuff clasts until c. 60 cm depth when \nthey, and all other igneous deposits, disappear abruptly (Fig. 6). There is also a significant shift in the type of rhyolitic \nclasts deposited in Zone 3 compared to Zone 5. Group 2 green rhyolites, 89% of which are found in Zones 3 and 4, are \nreplaced by Group 3 light green rhyolites, 88% of which are found in Zone 5. This change occurs at the same point in the \ncore as the increased abundance of Group 1\/7 clasts. As with Group 1\/7 clasts, Group 3 rhyolites dominate the rhyolitic \nclast assemblage until c. 60 cm depth when they also disappear abruptly (Fig. 6). \n \nCompared with ML the composition of the shorter AB core is dominated by Group 13\/14 sandstones\/siltstones\/mudstone \nclasts (87%), with only 13 volcanic clasts present (out of 366). The high proportion of plutonic clasts (9%) relative to ML \n(3%) and CIB (1%) is due to the presence of seven highly weathered and three fresh granitic clasts (Fig. 7). The highly \nweathered clasts are likely to have been eroded from moraines and\/or conglomerate deposits in the catchment (cf. \nClapperton and Sugden, 1983). It is likely that weathered plutonic clasts in the core are derived from the moraine deposits \nalong the lakeshore and the margins of ice-shelf. Possible shifts in rhyolite and tuffaceous clast distribution occur, but the \npaucity of clasts makes it difficult to judge whether these are significant and\/or related to erosion from catchment deposits \nor transportation through the ice shelf. Interestingly, the lack of volcanic deposits on the floor of Ablation Valley (Elliott, \n1975) appears to be reflected in the general lack of volcanic clasts in the AB core (Figs. 6 and 7).  \n \nDue to its isolation from ice-shelf transport processes, the clast diversity in the CIB core is low, with only four major clast \ntypes present (Fig. 6). There are no obvious shifts in clast-type and the clasts appear to have been deposited in well-\ndefined pulses (e.g. in Unit D). The majority of the clasts are sedimentary (Fig. 7), with Group 13\/14 sandstone\/mudstone \n13 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nclasts dominating (Fig. 6). The number of Group 23 light grey tuff clasts is significant (19%) and proportionately greater \nthan the ML and AB cores. The lack of variety in the volcanic clasts present in the CIB core reflects the general lack of \nvolcanic outcrops in the catchment strata. Tuffaceous outcrops of similar composition to Group 23 tuffs have been found \nin the CIB lake catchment (Fig. 2c). The only clast that might not come from a CIB catchment source is the single Group \n22-I granodiorite clast at 176 cm (Fig. 6: circled point 4). \n \n5. Clast geochemistry, isotopic composition and provenance \nGeochemical and isotopic analyses were used to further subdivide the provenance of clasts in the ML core. The following \nsection details geochemical and isotopic characteristics of the key lithological groups that constrain provenance and \ndepositional processes in Moutonn\u00e9e Lake. In summary, \u03b5Ndi values for primary igneous clasts range from \u20133.37 to 5.18 \n(Fig. 8). All the values, except for C142 (\u03b5Ndi=5.18), lie within the range of previous analyses from granites and \ngrandiorites from the Palmer Land (Fig. 8) (Millar et al., 2001). Overall, the clasts scatter around an Rb-Sr reference \nisochron of c. 143 Ma, approximately in the middle of the 90-200 Ma age range of rocks from Alexander Island and \nPalmer Land (Table 3).  \n \n5.1 Primary Igneous Clasts \nPrimary igneous clasts have similar REE and isotope compositions to several well-studied rock types from NW Palmer \nLand. Combined REE and isotope data from, in particular, granitic, dioritic and Group 1\/7 vitric tuff clasts are compatible \nwith a well-defined source in NW Palmer Land. Although a source in central and western Alexander Island, active during \nthe Late Cretaceous (c. 80-60 Ma), cannot be completely ruled out, a more extensive source in Palmer Land or post-\nsubduction Alexander Island is unlikely because the primary igneous clasts analysed have Sr and Nd isotope \ncompositions that are dissimilar to very young (<60 Ma) or very old (>228 Ma) Palmer Land plutonic rocks. It is not \npossible to distinguish igneous clasts derived from NW Palmer Land from those recycled through the Fossil Bluff Group \nusing geochemical or isotopic data. Nevertheless, some clasts show signs of substantial weathering consistent with \nrecycling through moraine deposits or the Fossil Bluff Group.  \n \n5.1.1 Plutonic clasts \nThe number of plutonic clasts in the ML core is relatively small. Nevertheless, clast compositions provide useful marker \npoints for comparison with more numerous volcanic clasts and are the most directly compatible with existing Sr and Nd \nisotope reference data. Three plutonic clasts were analysed: two granites (C68B and C18D), which represent all granites \nfound in the core, and one foliated diorite (A13), a rock-type that is known to outcrop in NW Palmer Land (Vaughan and \n14 \nMillar, 1996; Vaughan et al., 1997). Extensive superficial iron-oxide staining on C18D suggests it has been recycled \nthrough Fossil Bluff Group strata or catchment moraines. Moreover, C18D can be distinguished geochemically from \nC68B (i.e. unweathered granites) by its characteristically large negative Europium anomaly (Table 3), indicative of \nplagioclase fractionation and\/or weathering. The granitic and dioritic clasts analysed have contrasting Sr and Nd isotope \ncompositions. HREE vs LREE data suggest the heavily weathered granite clast, C18D, is derived from a \ncontinental\/intraplate magma source (Table 3), whilst its low negative \u03b5Nd\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \ni and high 87Sr\/86Sri values are compatible with \nexisting Late Triassic or Late Jurassic data (Fig. 8). Clast A13 (foliated diorite) has low positive \u03b5Ndi and very low \n87Sr\/86Sri values, firmly associated with data from NW Palmer Land Cretaceous plutonic outcrops (Fig. 8). \n \nThe granite clast found at 176 cm the CIB core is similar to sample KG.871.2 (hornblende granite sample) from \nAlexander Island. Furthermore, some of the weathered granitic clasts in the AB core have a similar composition\/external \nappearance (i.e. well-rounded, iron-stained) to weathered granite pebbles from conglomeratic outcrops in Ablation Valley \nin the BAS archives. With mean roundness of 2.4\u00b10.4 and 43% equant clasts they are distinct from the more angular \nweathered granite clasts (1.5\u00b10.6; 0%; Table 2) found in the ML core, and perhaps indicative of a different mode of \ntransport, for example, multiple-phase reworking from local moraines rather than first phase input from local outcrops \n(Elliott, 1975; Bishop and Walton, 1981; Clapperton and Sugden, 1983; Smith et al., 2006).  \n \n5.1.2 Volcanic clasts \nThe original source and final depositional provenance and evaluation of ice shelf retreat\/reformation processes is based \nprimarily on key rhyolitic and tuff clast types. Seventeen volcanic clasts, representing 12 different lithological types, were \nanalysed. Group 2, 3 rhyolites and Group 1\/7 olive\/dark vitric tuff\/lava clasts are the most significant clast types. In ML, \nthey occur throughout marine zones 2-4 in roughly equal proportions to sedimentary clasts and dominate the epishelf \nZone 5 sediments, yet they appear only sporadically in the AB core and are completely absent from the CIB core.  \n \nGroup 2 and 3 Rhyolites: Two clasts, one from each group, were analysed. Both are medium-K subalkaline tholeiites of \nthe calc-alkaline series. Major\/trace and REE compositions and Eu\/Eu* values of Group 2 and 3 rhyolites are similar \n(Table 3). Sr and Nd isotope data shows they have a different eruption age and\/or source (Fig. 8; Table 3). Group 2 \nrhyolites (e.g. C71) are characterised by low negative \u03b5Ndi and high 87Sr\/86Sri values typically associated with Late \nTriassic or Mid-Late Jurassic igneous rocks from Palmer Land (Fig. 8) (Millar et al., 2001). In contrast, Group 3 rhyolites \n(e.g. C83) have low positive \u03b5Ndi\/low 87Sr\/86Sri values more typically associated with Late Cretaceous igneous complexes \nof NW Palmer Land (Fig. 8). No Group 3 rhyolite specimens from the Ablation Point area were found in the BAS \n15 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \narchives, suggesting a restricted, but as yet undiscovered, outcrop in the Moutonn\u00e9e Valley area or transportation through \nGeorge VI Ice Shelf.  \n \nSeveral factors indicate that Group 3 rhyolites are most likely eroded from the ML catchment: (i) the simultaneous input \nof Group 3 rhyolites and Group 1\/7 clasts in Zone 5 of the ML core, (ii) their lack of striations, less well-rounded shape, \nthe small proportion of Group 3 weathered rhyolites (10% vs 18%) relative to Group 2 rhyolites (Table 2), (iii) a possible \nshift from Group 2 to Group 3 rhyolites in the AB core (iv) an absence of Group 2 rhyolites in all but the basal 5 cm of \nthe AB core. Moreover, if both types of rhyolite were eroded directly from Alexander Island outcrops or moraines it is \nlikely that both types would be represented in the epishelf lake sediments of Zone 5 of the ML core. \n \nGroup 1\/7 vitric tuffs: Group 1 tuff clasts are dark olive-green volcanic tuffs with 1-3 mm black ash\/scoraceous deposits. \nIn thin section, much of the groundmass is fine-grained\/unidentifiable or composed of plagioclase and\/or glassy \nfragments. The presence of secondary flow patterns and a well-preserved hyaloclastite texture, that has not been \nrecrystallised, suggests a subglacial eruption or thermal shocking in contact with water, both compatible with a magmatic \narc REE source classification. \n \nSr and Nd isotope analysis shows the original source of Group 1\/7 clasts has a strong affinity with Palmer Land \nCretaceous plutonic data (Fig. 8). However, their final source, prior to deposition into the lake, during the Holocene was \nprobably local, i.e., Alexander Island. Group 7 tuff clasts are distinguished from Group 1 clasts by higher proportions of \nplagioclase phenocrysts and their associated positive Europium anomalies (Table 3). Combined, group 1\/7 clasts form an \nevolutionary trend within the transitional alkaline series and exhibit negative relationship between Eu\/Eu* and silica \ncontent, reflecting increasing plagioclase fractionation from the melt (Fig. 8). They are clearly distinct from alkaline \n(C124: Grp. 19) and subalkaline (tholeiitic) (C270A: Grp. 28) dark green lava clasts, but have \u03b5Nd and 87Sr\/86Sri values \nthat are similar those of the foliated diorite clast A13, suggesting a well-defined NW Palmer Land source. Agglomerative \nhierarchical cluster analysis of all igneous clast \u03b5Ndi, 87Sr\/86Sri and Rb\/Sr data produces nine distinct cluster groups. \nOverall, no relationship exists between the different clast types in each cluster group, but it is interesting to note data from \nGroup 1\/7 clasts, C124, a trachyandesitic dark green lava, and A13 are closely related statistically. \n \nThe evolutionary relationships between Group 1\/7 clasts could reflect a single eruption event, or a similar eruption \nsource. The low to medium positive \u03b5Ndi and low 87Sr\/86Sri values indicate that olive\/dark green tuffs and lava clasts are \nprimarily derived from mantle sources with relatively little assimilation of older crust compared to other igneous clasts \n16 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n(Table 3). Their isotopic composition is compatible with Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous plutonic rocks from NW Palmer \nLand (Fig. 8) (Wareham et al., 1997; Millar et al., 2001) and outcrops with similar petrology in northern Palmer Land \n(Smith, 1987).  \n \nRock specimens of Group 1\/7 vitric tuffs and dark green lavas from Moutonn\u00e9e and Ablation Valley are well represented \nin the BAS archive collection. For example, the green vitric lava clast C124 is similar in hand specimen to sample \nKG802.1, a dark green fine-grained lava with dark chlorite filled amygdales, from the Himalia Ridge (Fig. 2b). Unlike \nAB and CIB, unidirectional glacially striated volcanic rocks (e.g. KG.853) and till deposits outcrop extensively on the \ngravel-covered valley floor around Moutonn\u00e9e Lake and volcanic deposits are common in adjacent screes and moraines \n(Elliott, 1974; Clapperton and Sugden, 1982; Clapperton and Sugden, 1983) .  \n \nThe presence of tuff deposits similar to Groups 1\/7 in agglomerate sample KG.804.1 suggests Group 1\/7 tuffs were \nsyndepositionally emplaced then reworked into the sedimentary deposits of Alexander Island. Moreover, substantial iron \noxide weathering on specimens equivalent to Group 1\/7 clasts (e.g. KG.877.1, KG.853.2 and KG.801.1) suggests \nderivation from conglomerate\/agglomerate beds of the Fossil Bluff Group and\/or moraine deposits within or at the \nentrance to Moutonn\u00e9e Valley (cf. Clapperton and Sugden, 1983).  \n \n5.2 Secondary clasts \n \n5.2.1 Secondary volcanic clasts \nMost significant are Group 23 grey\/white volcanic tuffs\/tuffaceous sandstones, which are present in all three cores. \nGreater than 70% of clasts of this type are found in the CIB core. Their presence throughout the core (and in the ML and \nAB cores) would suggest derivation from exposed strata from within the FBG in the CIB catchment rather than \ntransportation from distal sources.  Significantly, the arkosic sandstones and pebbly arkosic sandstones of the FBG \ncontain heavily reworked\/well rounded igneous clasts of pebble grade, similar to the granitic clasts found in the ML and \nAB cores. In the ML core, >80% of Group 23 clasts were found in the IRD Zone 3, but were notably absent from Zone 5 \nsediments. This likely reflects a significant change in the erosion source of (advancing?) catchment glaciers, sourcing of \ndifferent strata within the Fossil Bluff Group and\/or the relatively limited number of grey\/white volcanic tuff outcrops in \nMoutonn\u00e9e and Ablation Valley compared to the Citadel Bastion catchment. \n \n5.2.2 Sedimentary clasts \n17 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nIt is likely that sedimentary clasts are exclusively derived from the Fossil Bluff Group (FBG) strata on Alexander Island. \nIn this respect, their provenance relationships are not diagnostic of changing depositional processes. Sedimentary clasts \nare predominantly greywackes and shales. Exceptions are A8 and C11, which are litharenites and C187 which is an Fe-\nSand (cf. Herron, 1988). REE data from For Group 14 mudstones show that this lithology is characterised by a significant \npositive Europium anomaly (Table 3). The distribution of sandstones analysed in this study is similar to those from the \nPluto and Neptune Glacier Formations (cf. Browne, 1996). The geochemistry of the <63 \u03bcm silt and clay fraction in the \nML core is most similar to major element compositions of C522, C512 and C11, i.e. Group 14 black mudstones and \nGroup 16\/26 white\/grey sandstones. These are from layered outcrops that constitute most of the Fossil Bluff Group. \n \n6. Discussion \n6.1 Eruption sources, age and tectonic setting  \nMost rocks eroding from Palmer Land are c. 100-140 Ma. Two clasts, C71 (Group 2, Type I rhyolite) and C18d (Group \n22-III granite) form trendlines that are significantly older than the average clast age of c.140 Ma. An estimated age of c. \n180 Ma links them with Late Triassic-Upper Jurassic formations in Palmer Land. \n \n6.1.1 Primary clasts \nThe majority of the igneous clasts plot within the magmatic arc domain for AP rocks on HREE vs LREE (Th\/Yb vs \nTa\/Yb and Th\/Ta vs La\/Ta) ratio plots McCarron and Smellie (1998) used to define magmatic sources of Antarctic \nPeninsula rocks. The two exceptions are C18D (Group 22 granite) and C13A (Group 1 olive green crystal tuff). Sr and \nNd isotope data indicates these clasts could be derived from intraplate magmas or the Jurassic-mid Cretaceous Lemay \nGroup of Alexander Island (Doubleday, 1994).  \n \nUnaltered, crystal-rich volcanic tuffs and fine-grained rhyolites (e.g. Groups 1\/7, 2, 3) reflect the age and location of \nsource volcanism. Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (141-127 Ma) granitoid rocks of the western Palmer Land Central \nDomain are derived from the mantle, or by melting of underplate, and have low initial Sr ratios and high \u03b5Ndi values, \nwhile older rocks, which have assimilated continental crust, have higher initial Sr ratios and lower\/negative \u03b5Ndi values \n(Millar et al., 2001). Rb-Sr and Nd isotope data indicate that these clast types probably originated from volcanic rocks \nfrom in Palmer Land, most likely during a period of widespread and intensive Early Cretaceous arc-related volcanism  at \naround 140 Ma. (Millar et al., 2001).  \n \n6.1.2 Secondary and sedimentary clasts \n18 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \n32 \nSecondary and sedimentary clasts (e.g. lithic-rich tuffs and tuffaceous sandstone clasts) are not diagnostic indicators of \neruption age or source because they contain a large component of reworked sedimentary material. The Sr and Nd isotope \ncomposition more than likely reflects the c. 140 Ma average age of rocks from NW Palmer Land and Alexander Island. \nAll non igneous clasts and sediments sand-silt fraction sediments from the ML core plot in either arc related or active \ncontinental margin fields (Bhatia, 1983; Roser and Korsch, 1986).  \n \n6.2 Depositional model & modes \nBased on detailed on-site investigation, Smith et al. (2006) have proposed a combined biological, geochemical and \nlithological conceptual model for detecting periods of ice shelf loss from the analysis of epishelf lake sediments (Fig. 3). \nIn this model, periods of ice-shelf presence are defined by a restricted range of clast lithologies and clast provenance \n(mainly catchment-derived rocks plus some input from specific locations upstream of the main ice shelf flow lines).  In \ncontrast, periods of ice shelf absence would result in a wider range of clast lithologies sourced from a wider region \nincorporating both rocks from Alexander Island and rock from further a field transported to the site as ice rafted debris.   \n \nLithological and clast isotopic provenance analyses allow us to develop this model further. Six modes of clast deposition \nin Moutonn\u00e9e Lake are summarised in Table 4. These reflect: (i) clast source areas; (ii) erosion and depositional \nprocesses;  (iii) the relative influence\/depositional potential of catchment glaciers vs ice shelf transport; and (iv) changes \nin the strength and\/or direction of ice shelf flow pathways into the lakes. \n \nSome caution has to be exercised, however, when assigning specific provenance locations and modes of deposition. \nAbsolute determinations of source remain elusive for many clast types for the following reasons:  \n(i) The principal difficulty in identifying provenance of the sedimentary clasts is the bimodal provenance signal from the \naccretionary complex and volcanic arc that was active in Palmer Land at the time. The petrography of sediments in the \nAlexander Island mega basin sequence reflect coeval arc volcanism, and erosion of older Palmer Land volcanic outcrops. \nVolcanic deposits in the Fossil Bluff Group or along Moutonn\u00e9e Valley were derived from the rocks of the Central \nDomain, but could be related to ash\/tuffs that were deposited synformationally (Horne, 1968). In both cases, the isotopic \nsignature will be the same as near source igneous outcrops in Palmer Land. Similarly, the lower Cretaceous sandstones \nand conglomerates of the Alexander Island sediments were thought to have been derived from an elevated source area \ncomposed of granodioritic, parametamorphic and volcanic rocks (Butterworth, 1991; Browne, 1996).  \n(ii) Relative to Palmer Land, there are few volcanic outcrops in the lake catchment strata. Tuff and ash deposits in the top \nof the Himalia Ridge and Spartan Glacier Formations are most likely products of Late Cretaceous\/Early Tertiary \neruptions from Alexander Island and\/or coeval volcanism in Palmer Land. \n19 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n(iii) Reworked AP erratics (primarily granites) and granitic rocks associated with the Himalia Formation of Alexander \nIsland have been found in conglomerate and moraine sequences of the Ablation Point massif and along the Moutonn\u00e9e \nLake shoreline (Clapperton and Sugden, 1982; Clapperton and Sugden, 1983; Smith et al., in press). Reworked clasts \nwere distinguished from freshly eroded\/exotic clasts to some extent by their highly weathered, rounded and\/or iron \nstained appearance. This is not entirely diagnostic and it is possible that clasts could be from unweathered or unexposed \nparts of such deposits. \n(iv) Major\/trace and REE data from the Fossil Bluff Group is limited. Further isotopic work that might tighten clast \nsource areas is in progress and it may be possible to pinpoint source outcrops more accurately in future (e.g. Flowerdew \net al., 2003). \n(iv) Palmer Land analyses were undertaken on granites, granodiorites and tonalities. GVIIS analyses were undertaken on \navailable clast types. These were dominated by tuffs and rhyolites and sedimentary clasts that may not be directly related \nto the Palmer Land crustal evolution. This study is different to most geological investigations because it was not possible \nto select, a priori, the most suitable rock types for analyses. Certain volcanic clasts (e.g. tuffs) and bulk compositions are \nnot necessarily diagnostic of a particular source.  \n \nNevertheless, there is a clear difference in lithology and geochemistry of the clasts deposited in the marine ML Zones 2-4 \ncompared with clasts from the other zones in the ML core and from the reference cores (CIB, AB). Specifically the \nmelange of clast types of predominantly medium (10-50 g) to large (>50 g) mass in Zone 3 follows the first incursion of \nmarine water (Zone 2) and suggests that the ice shelf dam and lake ice had disappeared allowing icebergs from George VI \nSound to drift into the newly formed marine embayment and deposit ice rafted debris. The assemblage in Zone 4 is \ninitially dominated (to c. 270 cm depth; c. 8500 ka BP) by local Group 14 mudstones\/siltstones of the FBG, but the fine \nsediments deposited in the latter half of this zone suggest ice-rafting was not the dominant sedimentary process c. 8500-\n7500 yr. BP. The switch to an assemblage dominated by Group 1\/7 olive green vitric tuff clasts in Zone 5 suggests \nIRD\/marine deposition processes ceased at this time and instead were replaced by local glaciers from Moutonn\u00e9e Valley, \ncalving directly into the newly formed marine embayment, and depositing locally-sourced volcanic material.  \n \n6.3 Relationship to wider events \nClapperton and Sugden (1982) constructed a preliminary Holocene glacial history for George VI Sound from \ngeomorphological relationships between till deposits, moraines, radiocarbon and amino acid racemization ages from \nbarnacles in moraines deposits. Their radiocarbon ages suggested open water conditions existed in George VI Sound at \n20 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nleast until c. 6500 14C yr B.P. (c. 6000 cal yr BP \u2013 2\u03c3 median probability, using same input factors as Bentley et al., 2005) \nwith four phases of valley glacier advance including an advance phase prior to c. 6000 yr. BP. \n \nWithout accurate age constraints in the upper half of the ML core it is not possible to categorically assign gaps in the \ndown core distribution of olive\/dark green rhyolitic and tuffaceous clasts between 236-44 cm to climatically induced \nchanges in glacial activity. Nevertheless, six phases of increased Group 1\/7 clast density exist. This suggests up to five \nphases of increased glacial activity, some of which could be contemporaneous with the four phases of valley glacier \nadvance proposed by Clapperton and Sugden (1982). Phases of increased Group 1\/7 clast density are indicative, perhaps, \nof pulsed deposition from stagnating lake ice, calving-related deposition in the near-shelf area of the lake and\/or \nfluctuations at its margin related to retreat of catchment glaciers, perhaps during periods of precipitation decline. \n \nShifts in clast data associated with the transition from marine embayment to epishelf lake conditions support our previous \nconclusion (Bentley et al., 2005) that GVIIS was absent from the Ablation Point area between 9595 and 7945 cal. yr. BP. \nThis retreat occurred immediately after a period of maximum Holocene warmth documented in the EPICA Dome C ice \ncore record (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2004) and at the same time as an influx of warmer Circumpolar Deep Water onto \nthe continental shelf (Domack et al., 2001; Bentley at al., 2005). Not long after the initial ice-shelf break up, ice-rafted \ndebris was deposited into ML. Subsequent reformation of the ice-shelf occurred at the same time period as a the Holocene \nclimatic minimum in the EPICA Dome C ice core (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2004). There is no clear evidence of \nsubstantial phases of retreat or a return to marine conditions during the well-documented, and prolonged, \u2018mid-Holocene \nwarm period\u2019 (Hodgson et al., 2004), when conditions were warm enough to cause significant retreat of ice shelves across \nthe northern AP (Domack et al., 1999; Domack et al., 2001; Pudsey and Evans, 2001; Taylor et al., 2001; Hodgson et al., \n2004). \n \n7. Conclusions \n\u2022 Clasts >8 mm in cores from three lakes on eastern Alexander Island can provide a proxy measure of changes in the \nconfiguration of GVIIS. The Moutonn\u00e9e Lake core has significant changes in clast type and density that are coupled \nto retreat phases of GVIIS and, most likely, readvance phases of local catchment glaciers in Moutonn\u00e9e Valley. \n \n\u2022 The early Holocene retreat of GVIIS in the Ablation Point area (Bentley et al., 2005) is marked by a distinct \ndepositional shift from a more \u2018ordered\u2019 assemblage and low number of clast types when the ice shelf is present to a \nmore chaotic distribution of clasts and more numerous clast types during the period when the ice-shelf was absent. \n21 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n29 \n30 \n31 \nDuring periods of ice-shelf loss, the lithological assemblage is dominated a range of exotic clasts. Iceberg rafting of \nmaterial is likely to be the dominant sedimentary process during periods of ice-shelf loss. Subglacial flow through the \nice-shelf is relatively minor compared to the input of material from local catchment glaciers and iceberg rafting. \n \n\u2022 Further isotopic and age analyses of volcanic outcrops on Alexander Island and NW Palmer Land are necessary to \ndetermine provenance more precisely. This is a substantial undertaking, beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, \ndata presented in this paper have identified six modes of clast transport highlighting the complex provenance and \ndepositional processes in Moutonn\u00e9e Lake and the GVIIS-epishelf lake sedimentary system along the eastern coast of \nAlexander Island. \n \nAcknowledgements: This study was funded by the BAS core program \u2018Signals in Antarctica of past Global ChangeS\u2019 \n(SAGES)-10K, the NERC Antarctic Funding Initiative project (AFI2\/69 and CGS00\/06) with additional support from the \nNERC Radiocarbon Laboratory, East Kilbride, the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory, Keyworth.

Cores were cut frozen and stored in the dark. Sub-\nsamples for dating were extracted from the central portion of an undisturbed half-section of the core; Notes: \na=Foraminifera radiocarbon ages (ML core only): Two species (Globocassidulina sp. and Cibicides sp.) were analysed at \nthree AMS-dating facilities, Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, University of Glasgow (SUERC), Beta \nAnalytical (BETA), University of Arizona (AA). Forams analysed at Beta Analytical received no pre-treatment. Forams \nanalysed at SUERC and Arizona were hydrolysed to CO2 using 85% orthophosphoric acid (AnalaR). Bulk sediment ages \nfrom ML, AB and CIB cores: CAMS\/AA samples were digested in 2M HCl (80oC, 10 hours) washed free of mineral acid \nwith distilled water, dried and homogenised. Total carbon in a known weight of the pre-treated sample was recovered as \nCO2 by heating with CuO in a sealed quartz tube. The gas was converted to graphite by Fe\/Zn reduction. Samples were \nanalysed at the Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (CAMS), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, \nUniversity of California and University of Arizona AMS facility (AA).

Palmer Land outcrop ages are independently determined age of \nplutonic rocks from Palmer Land (Wareham et al., 1997; Millar et al., 2001); b=\u03b5Nd data as shown in Fig. 15; c=TDM is \nthe two-stage depleted mantle model age in Ga, and represents an estimate of the time of extraction of the parental \nmagma of each sample from a theoretical depleted mantle reservoir (Depaolo et al., 1991). Method summary: Samples \nwere sawn in half and thin sections made from one half. The outer\/weathered surfaces of the other half were removed by \ngrinding, the remaining core crushed in a mini-rock splitter and ground by hand to a fine powder in a clean agate pestle \nand mortar. Powders were analysed for ten major elements using fused-disc method in a Philips PW2404 wavelength-\ndispersive, sequential X-ray fluorescence spectrometer following method of Norrish and Hutton (1969). The spectrometer \nwas calibrated for major-element analysis with international standard samples (PCC1, BEN, BIR1, AGV1, RGM1, ALI, \nFKN), using concentrations recommended by Govindaraju (1994). Precision and accuracy are typically 5-10% for most \nmajor elements. Trace element and REE analysis was undertaken at Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre \n(SUERC) following procedures in Olive et al. (2001). In summary, 0.1 g of material was dissolved by a simple tri-acids \ndigestion (4 ml of 48 % (29 M) HF, 50 % (16 M) HNO3 and 10 % (1 M) HCl) in a 15 ml screw cap Teflon Savillex \nbeaker and subsequently diluted in 5% HNO3 for analyses. Residual organic compounds present in some clast samples \nwere removed by additional treatment with 30% H2O2. A VG Elemental PQ2 Plus fitted with a Meinhard nebulizer and a \nwater-cooled glass Scott double pass spray chamber was used. Instrumental sensitivity was set up to 35 million counts per \nsecond for 1 ppm 115In. Data acquisition was made in Peak Jumping mode with 3 points per peak and 3 replicates of 90 \nseconds each. 115In, 102Ru and 185Re were used as internal standards. The quality of the data was controlled by regular \nanalyses of geostandard BCR. Other geostandards (DR-N; MA-N; BEN; BCR; AGV) were also analysed to double-check \nthe quality of the data. All data are expressed in ppm and analysed on a carbonate-free basis to avoid the influence of \nbiogenic Ca. Uncertainties are \u00b11-2% (Olive et al., 2001). Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotope analysis was undertaken at the \nNERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory following the methods of Pankhurst et al. (1993). Sr isotope compositions were \ndetermined using static multicollection on a Thermo-Finnegan Triton mass-spectrometer to an internal precision of better \nthan 5 ppm (1 s.e.m.). During the period of analysis, 13 analyses of the Sr isotope standard NBS987 gave a value of \n0.710249\u00b10.000006 (2\u03c3).  Nd isotope compositions were determined using static multicollection on a Thermo-Finnegan \nTriton mass spectrometer.  Sixteen analyses of the internal J&M Nd isotope standard gave a value of 0.511113\u00b10.000004 \n(2\u03c3); reported 143Nd\/144Nd values were normalised to a value of 0.511130 for this standard, equivalent to 0.511864 for La \n31 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \nJolla. Blanks for Sr and Nd were less than 500 pg and 180 pg respectively.
