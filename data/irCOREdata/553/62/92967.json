Retirement ages, work \npractices and housing needs will be affected but changes are \nlikely to be mediated via new technology and hence cannot be \nexactly predicted. While the ageing population is usually \nprojected in terms of dependency or support ratios, in this paper \nprojections are for older people as a proportion of eligible \nvoters. American experience of the growing power of the elder's \nlobby is related to the European context, with emphasis on the \ngrowth of a framework for lobbying activity in a European context. \nWhile a mass movement of older people is even less likely in \nEurope than in the USA, public choice theory would suggest that as \nthe numbers of older people rises towards 50% of eligible voters, \npoliticians and policy makers will change their policies even \nwithout a united elderly bloc vote. There is also empirical \nevidence to suggest that policy makers perceive elderly people as \na homogeneous, and hence a more powerful, bloc than their real \ndivisions in terms of age, class, ethnicity and gender might \nindicate.  \n \nThe European situation differs from the American in that the \nproportion of older voters is very much higher over all and will \nbe even higher in retirement areas and in areas of out migration. \nThe development of a Europe of the regions may allow older \npeoples' pressure groups to have greater influence in Brussels, \nby-passing their national governments. They may therefore be more \neffective than at present appears likely when the situation is \nlooked at from a national perspective.  Older women who, in some \ncountries will make up 30% of the potential electorate, may come \nto have a growing influence on social policy as they unite with \nyounger women to improve access to equal European citizenship for \ncaregivers and those who receive care. \n \n \n \nThe challenge of an ageing electorate: changes in the formation of \nsocial policy in Europe? \n \n \nThe ageing of European populations is now a widely understood \nphenomenon. There are minor variations in the rate of ageing and \nthe composition of the aged population across Europe, but the \ntrend is common to all countries. The implications of the change \nhave attracted little positive comment. However, 1993 is the \nEuropean Year of the Elderly and the time is ripe for a \nreconsideration of the place of elders in public policy formation. \nThis article is intended to provoke discussion on different \naspects of policy in ageing societies. The content is necessarily \nspeculative. Not only is the future unknown but necessary \ninformation is often lacking (for example from longitudinal \nstudies of ageing) because the elderly have not been a major \nconcern of governments or social scientists.  \n \nDiscussion of the social policy of ageing tends to be either \nnegative or patronising - sometimes both. The structured \ndependency theorists (Estes, 1979; Townsend, 1981; 1986; \nPhillipson, 1982; Walker, 1980; 1983), have, often with the best \nintentions, seen old age as a time of marginalisation, of \nuselessness to a capitalist economy and as worse than useless - a \nburden. Old people are described as being forced out of the labour \nforce into dependency, first on pensions and then on social and \nresidential care. This structured dependency model has been \nchallenged (Dant,1988; Johnson, 1988) by evidence that many, if \nnot most, old people retire willingly and the great majority lead \nindependent lives for many years afterwards. However, the poverty \nof older people, particularly the oldest old and women, lends \nsupport to some aspects of structured dependency theory. \n \nIn discussions of present policy, social security and health have \nattracted the most attention. Social security policies in response \nto an ageing population are well set out in ILO (1987). The \nmessage in this publication is determinedly up beat but the facts, \nas presented, belie the message: a smaller working population \ncould find it increasingly hard to finance pensions for the \ngrowing number of retired elders. \n \nIn health care the well documented fact that older people are \nheavy users of health services is used to justify another doom and \ngloom scenario (see for example Haut Conseil de la population et \nla famille, 1992). In UK at present a person over 75 is four times \nmore likely to be hospitalised in any one year than an adult aged \nless than 44. Costs are high. In health and social security the \nold are often seen as a burden which is about to become \nintolerable.  \n \nPolicy Formation \n \nThe process of policy formation involves groups of younger adults \nacting on behalf of old people, rather than old people themselves. \nThese groups are part of what Estes (1979) has called the 'aging \nenterprise'. They help to keep alive the idea of the elderly as a \nspecial client group in social policy.  Pressure groups, \ngerontologists and service providers attempt to counteract the \nnegative image of old people by a variety of campaigns, eg the \nEuropean Year of the Elderly and Intergenerational Solidarity \n(1993). However by maintaining the image of old people as a \ndisadvantaged group who are unable to speak for themselves and \nhave to rely on powerful, often upper class, campaigners they undo \nmuch of what they accomplish. \n \nThe question posed here is whether European elders will shift from \nbeing the recipients or objects of social policy to having  a real \ninfluence on policies which enhance their own interests. The \nfollowing sections consider how far American experience might \napply to Europe and how far specifically European conditions will \ninfluence possible outcomes. \n \nDemographic change and its implications \n \nThe demographic projections of the numbers of older Europeans (see \nTable 1) are unlikely to be very far wrong. Short of a \ncatastrophic decline in life expectancy, the numbers of older \npeople are predictable. At present the AIDS epidemic does not \nappear to be sufficiently virulent in Europe to bring about a \nmajor downturn in survival rates. Changes in the birthrate could, \nand very likely will, occur but they will take time, (upwards of \n18 years), to work their way through to the voting age population.  \n \nWe are heading for a series of European societies such as have \nnever been known on earth before: societies where children, who \nused to be in the majority, will be a relatively small minority, \nand the majority of adults will be over 50. It is agreed that \nthese societies will be different, (see for example Gillion, 1991) \nbut first, we do not know how they will differ from today and \nsecond, the prospect of radically different societies is not yet \npart of our everyday thinking. \n \nCohort effects \n \nThe effect of life experiences on different generations of elders \ncannot be predicted, (see below on voting behaviour). However it \nis widely believed that elders of the future will be less passive, \nhave higher expectations and be more demanding than current \npensioners. Cohort studies identify differences across age groups \n(see for example DaneAge (1990) which found cohort differences in \na wide range of areas from a propensity to take exercise to \npolitical participation). It is certain that the elders of the \nfuture will be on average more educated and more healthy. They \nwill most probably be better housed and in most countries will be \nbetter off financially. The social support they can call on from \ntheir families is likely to change as more women remain in paid \nwork but this does not mean that older people will feel neglected. \n \nHealth \n \nIt is not clear whether life expectancy will go on increasing as \nit has in past years in  most countries (Eastern Europe excepted), \nbut better health (see for example Henning, (1992) on the improved \nhealth of elders in Denmark) will enable older people to take an \nactive part in their communities for longer and hence to hold more \npower and be more active as voters.  \n  .  \nWhile increases in the numbers and proportions of the very old \n(over 85) will almost certainly mean an increase in expenditure on \nsocial and medical care, we cannot assume that the increase will \nbe pro rata. All European countries except Greece are at present \ntrying to contain health care costs (Abel-Smith, 1992). \nTechnological changes are in sight which will allow a great many \nmore procedures to be done on an outpatient basis or in local \nhealth centres or clinics. Costs will fall. These trends combined \nwith the 'living will' movement (which allows a person to specify \nthat they will not be subjected to needless medical procedures \nwhen they are dying), and cost cutting attempts to end heroic \nsurgery on terminally ill patients, may greatly reduce the cost of \nelder treatment. Such developments would cut the costs of health \ncare for the elderly relative to the costs for other age groups. \nThe demand for elderly health care would thus be seen as less \nexcessive and so have greater legitimacy. It can be argued that \n'minimalist medicine' for older people will be both cost effective \nand better for patients (James Malone Lee, personal \ncommunication). \n \nWork \n \nThe future of older workers is problematic. The relation between \npension levels, capital accumulation and expectations will \ninteract with opportunities for employment. Much will depend on \nnational and local economic development. In areas where work is \navailable, or if existing work is shared differently across age \ngroups and sexes, it is very likely that older people will \ncontinue in paid work for longer than they do today, even in \ncountries such as Greece where activity rates are still high. In \ndepressed areas paid working life may get still shorter. Women are \nlikely to show different participation patterns from men. For \nexample older women's participation rates have risen in UK and \nSweden in the last few years (Esping-Anderson and Sonnberger, \n1989). It is possible that retirement ages will be raised but such \na change will need to be accompanied by European directives \nagainst age discrimination in employment if it is to be of much \nassistance to older workers (see EurolinkAge, 1991 for information \non campaigns against age discrimination). Where labour force \nparticipation is maintained, incomes and participation in \ncommunity and political life (including trade unions) are likely \nto be higher than at present. \n \nHousing \n \nIn much of Europe, particularly the Mediterranean states, housing \nfor older people still involves a degree of co-residence with \nother age groups. There is no reason to think that this will \npersist, given the preference of older people for 'intimacy at a \ndistance'- living near, but not with, their kin, which has \ndeveloped in most norther European countries.  \n \nSo far the concept of housing for the life course, or 'mobility' \nhousing which incorporates facilities for disabled people into \nbasic housing specifications, has made only a limited impact \noutside Scandinavia. As, or if, the policy is accepted and \nmobility standards are incorporated into building regulations, \nmuch disability in older people which now demands \ninstitutionalisation or some form of community care may become a \nmatter of self care. Once again autonomy and the potential for \npolitical participation may increase. \n \nMobility and technological advance \n \nIt is not possible to predict how long it will take for computer \nand other technologies to revolutionise the use of transport (in \nterms of shopping needs), of work (in terms of dispersion of \nworkplaces to the home, and of communications (in terms of \nmonitoring frail elders and getting assistance to them as needed), \n(Commission of the European Communities, 1984). Certainly the \nsuccess of Minitel in France suggests that much could be achieved \nin ten years and that a revolution may be possible in 20. \n \nMany current disabilities of frail elders could be reduced by \nsimple changes such as buses with tail end lifts, already used in \nsome districts in Sweden. The development of cheap, safe, effort \nfree personal transport would revolutionise mobility for many in \nlater life. Computerised shopping and bill payment will be another \nbreakthrough. Such changes could radically alter the ability of \nfrail or disabled old people to take part in community life. It \nmay be argued that they will not be able to take advantage of new \ntechnology, but this too is likely to prove to be an ageist \nprejudice, and older people will use technology when it improves \nthe quality of their lives. \n \nSpecial TV programmes directed at elderly audiences via satellite \nor cable links may increase the knowledge needed to campaign for \nbetter conditions. They may also encourage elders to see \nthemselves in a more positive light and so to be more  willing to \nidentify themselves as part of a mass movement. \n \nVolunteering and self care \n \nEven if healthy elders are excluded from the labour market, it \nseems very probable that more will find the energy needed to do \nfree or expenses-paid voluntary work. Grandmothers will most \nprobably continue to look after young children in countries where \nthey do so at present. They may also find themselves in semi-paid \noccupations in the caring professions where labour is short. \n \nAs the retired population becomes more educated and in most \nEuropean countries slightly more affluent, the opportunities to \ncontribute to the economy, even in unpaid capacities are almost \ncertain to increase and hence the ability to maintain self \nrespect, cohesion and political influence. \n \nElectoral change \n \nAll the above changes are likely to have a greater or lesser \nimpact on the status of the elderly and on the formation and \nimplementation of social policy. However the biggest and most \ninescapable change will be in the numbers of older people as \ncompared to younger. Such changes are usually expressed as \ndependency ratios (or less negatively as the converse, support \nratios). From the point of view of social policy as dominated by \nsocial security considerations, this is the right measure of \npopulation ageing. \n \nHowever if the aim is to consider elders as a factor in policy \nformation or as a pressure group, a more useful measure is the \nproportion of eligible voters over a certain age. The age of \nretirement is sometimes chosen but in European terms this is \nunsatisfactory. Official retirement ages vary and are changing as \na result of European Court directives on equal opportunities. In \nrecent years there has been a widening of the gap between official \nretirement ages and de facto retirement ages, which have dropped \n(Laczko and Phillipson, 1991). There is no reason to think that \ncurrent retirement ages will be maintained over the next thirty \nyears. \n \nAlso if the aim is to delineate a constituency or potential \npolitical grouping it is important to consider cohorts below \nretirement age on the grounds that at a certain age they begin to \nlook ahead and to identify with retired people. The age of 55 has \ntherefore been chosen in Table 1. It gives the present and \nprojected proportions for a range of European countries and \nTurkey. The latter gives an idea of the way that Western Europe \ndiffers from many less developed non-European countries. Eastern \nEuropean countries have been omitted. They show similar but less \nmarked tendencies, despite recent evidence of falling life \nexpectancies in some countries. \n \nTable 1 \n \nTable 1 shows that there is a projected increase of almost 10% in \nthe proportion of potential voters over 55 between 1990 and 2020. \nCountries where almost one third of potential voters are now over \n55 will be in the position of having nearly half of all voters in \nthis age group by 2020. As might be expected the trend is least \nmarked in the Mediterranean countries and most in the Northern \nEuropean. Italy with its sudden collapse in the birth rate is the \nexception on ageing, and Norway with a rise in the birth rate is \nprojected to maintain a younger population for longer. \n \nIt has been argued, for example by Torres-Gil (1992), that it is \nnot just the ability to think ahead to old age (so noticeably \nabsent in early adulthood) that unites those over 50 with retired \npeople. In middle age many people will begin to worry about the \ngrowing frailty of their parents. They may then make common cause \nwith the elderly lobby to provide better care and perhaps even \nhigher incomes to cope with growing frailty. A measure of the \nproportion of voters over 50 produces even more dramatic numbers \nfor a potential elders lobby. Table 2 lists those countries where \nhalf of all potential voters are projected as being over 50 in \n2020. They include most of the northern welfare states, though the \nposition of a united Germany is unclear. Switzerland stands out \namong non-EC states with over 55% of the potential electorate in \nthe older age groups by 2020.  \n \nTable 2 \n \n \nFrom demography to grey power? \n \nNumbers of potential voters are one thing. The conversion from \nnumbers to a functioning interest group is quite another. The \nsimplistic view, that growing numbers of old people mean more \npower for older age groups and more expenditure on their welfare, \nalong with a corresponding shift away from younger people, has \nbeen argued by Pampel and Williamson (1989). Their argument relies \non the US for evidence of lobby power and on numbers for all other \nstates. This failure to extend the political argument beyond the \nUnited States is no accident. So far there is little evidence that \nolder people form any sort of political group except in America. \nThe following paragraphs will consider the interaction of European \ninstitutions with demographic trends. \n \nOlder voters \n \nPolitical scientists have been concerned with the 'elderly voter' \nas one of several constituencies which must be identified in order \nto predict or analyze the outcome of elections. For example \nDunleavy and Husbands (1985) identify voters over the age of 55 \nseparately from the rest of the electorate. They show that retired \nvoters were just as likely to vote Labour as the rest of the \npopulation unless they were among the minority of pensioners with \nabove average incomes. These better off pensioners were very much \nmore likely than the average to vote conservative. The implication \nis that normal class and interest group cleavages, which set tax \npayers against recipients of state transfers, will continue into \nold age. No solidarity is to be expected among older people \n(Oriol, 1981; Midwinter and Tester, 1987). \n \nOthers have related age to voting behaviour in different ways. \nButler and Stokes (1974) do not believe that age in itself has any \ngreat influence on voting but that generation or cohort does. As \nthey say 'We must not ask how old the elector is, but when he \n(sic) was young.' (Butler and Stokes, 1974: 54). In their view, \nwell illustrated by Andrews (1991), people who are loyal to a \nparty or set of political principles stay loyal, while those who \nchange in youth may change in age. They conclude that: \n'conservation of established political tendencies increases with \nage, not conservatism' (Butler and Stokes, 1974: 62).  \n \nIt follows from the Butler and Stokes's approach that people may \nwell vote for different parties as they age and that the change \nmay not always be in favour of more conservative political \nprogrammes. However between the ages of 50 and 95 there will have \nbeen many different experiences of youth. If older voters change \ntheir voting habits there is no guarantee that they will all \nchange them in the same direction. It is possible that older \nvoters will become politically more divided, not less. \n \nA different theory of elderly voting patterns has been put forward \nby Rose and McAllister (1990). In their view voting behaviour is a \nfunction of age, though not only of age. Noting that people over \n65 are more likely to vote Conservative, they suggest that age and \nconservatism (with a small c) go together and that if a party is \nseen as the party of change fewer old people will vote for it. \nHowever they also see evidence that voters can learn or change \neven at older ages. They note that the Labour vote among older \nelectors in the UK has fallen. According to this theory, \ntherefore, if an elder lobby develops, older voters may well shift \nallegiance to support it. \n \nOther European countries have voting patterns which are less class \ndominated than in Britain. Different social cleavages may be more \npowerful. Religion, region and language may all predict voting \nbehaviour more accurately than class. The trend towards a Europe \nof the regions as opposed to a Europe of nation states (Batley and \nStoker, 1991; Gripaios and Gripaios, 1992; Rhodes, 1992) could \nincrease the tendency of all voters, including older people, to \nidentify with interest groups rather than political parties. \n \nDiversity v.Interest group formation \n \nAs the previous sections illustrated, older people are not a \nnatural political grouping in most countries. Even in America \ncommentators have persistently stressed their variety (Ragan and \nDavis, 1975; Rose and Peterson, 1963; Williamson et al.1982; \nTorres-Gil, 1992). However elders have been successful in becoming \na recognised political group and in altering social policy in \ntheir favour.  \n \nWhile emphases differ, American authors generally see four key \naspects in the growth of political influence of older people. The \nfirst is social marginalisation and the development of a sub-\nculture (Rose, 1963). Older people recognise their difference from \nyounger age groups and form associations. Some writers have seen \nindividuals as a key influence, either in favour of elders \n(Lammers and Klingman, 1984) or against them (Putnam (1970). \nSecond, once formed the associations need to build coalitions with \nother groups (Pratt, 1976). Authors differ in the emphasis they \ngive to different coalitions. Williamson et al (1982) see labour \nunion support as a key while Estes (1979) cites a wider coalition \nwhich she terms the 'aging enterprise', (and regards as ultimately \nharmful to the interests of elders). Third, a framework \nestablished at national level enables existing movements in favour \nof older people to exercise greater power. Congressional hearings \nand the related legislation raise the profile of elderly people. A \nraised profile results in greater legitimation, first for elderly \npeople to join elder organisations and second greater public \nsupport for elder claims. \n \nThe fourth stage is to some extent a reversal. Public recognition \nof the legitimacy of elder claims has limitations. Williamson et \nal (1982) and Torres-Gil (1992) both follow Mauss (1971) in seeing \nthe elder lobby in the US as an example of a movement in danger of \nbeing destroyed by its success. Progress, from a marginalised \ngroup to strength via a combination of lobby power and broad \nsocial concern with the plight of older Americans, first results \nin gains for older people, particularly in the field of social \nsecurity and health care. However the success is widely perceived \nas having resulted in shift of social resources from younger \nworkers towards elder retired people. When such a shift is so big \nthat it is seen as unfair or going too far, the legitimacy of \ndemands made by the elders lobby is challenged. For example \nAmericans for Generational Equality (AGE), now wound up and merged \nwith the Association of Baby Boomers was formed to combat \n'excessive' shifts in resources from young to old. Torres-Gil \n(1992) sees the repeal, in 1989, of the Medicare Catastrophic \nCoverage Act 1988 as the turning point for American elders. As he \nsays, 'No other major legislation had ever been enacted and \nrepealed within a year due to political pressure. On the other \nhand, older people were perceived, as a result, as a selfish \ninterest group wanting expanded benefits without the burden on \npaying for them'.( Torres-Gil 1992: 81). \n \nUS commentators therefore see a future in which older people will \nhave more political resources in terms of votes, education and \npossibly money, but not necessarily more political power unless \nthe legitimacy of their demands can be maintained or they move to \nvoting as a bloc. \n \nApplicability of US experience to Europe \n \nMarginalisation \n \nFollowing Rose (1965) there is no difficulty in seeing older \npeople in Europe as a marginalised group even though the degree of \nmarginalisation may vary in modern times. The elderly have long \nbeen held in low esteem across the continent. Stearns (1977) gives \na particularly negative historical picture of the status of old \npeople in France (Sterns,1977), though this is somewhat modified \nby Troyanski (1982). A select group of rich old people were able \nto maintain respect (Guillemard, 1980) because of their control \nover material resources, but even they were often recorded as \nobjects of envy and ridicule rather than veneration or respect \namong the younger generation who wished to come into their \ninheritance. There appears to be little historical evidence in any \nEuropean country of a golden age when property-less old men were \nwell treated, let alone old women.  \n \nIn modern times welfare states have improved the lot of the old to \nvarying degrees. The process has advanced furthest in Scandinavia. \nIn Denmark for example elderly users are represented on local user \ncouncils for the services they consume (Kristiansen, 1992). As \nDaneAge put it 'elderly people... were characterised chiefly by \npoverty, ill health and loneliness...we do not feel as powerless \nor alienated as many people did in the past.. a change in the \npattern of sex roles has especially made women more self confident \nand active' (DaneAge, 1990: 40). Poverty however remains for some, \neven in Denmark. In France a conscious attempt was made to enable \nelders to share in the benefits of post war reconstruction via the \n1962 Raport Laroque (Guillemard, 1980), but it is still difficult \nto argue that elderly people are not marginalised both financially \nand culturally. It therefore seems safe to predict that older \npeople will be identifiable as a marginalised group in all \nEuropean countries over the next decades. \n \nDevelopment of a Mass Movement \n \nThe ability of European elders to form mass movements on the lines \nof the American Association of Retired Person with 30m members \n(Torres-Gil, 1992) is likely to be limited. The strong European \ntradition of marginalising or downgrading old people makes it less \nlikely that they will wish to identify themselves as 'old' by \njoining a mass movement of seniors. For the same reasons the \ndevelopment of high profile militant movements such as the Grey \nPanthers will also have limited impact. At present there is no \ncatalyst such as the need for cheap health insurance, identified \nby Williamson et al (1982) as one of the major factors behind the \nsuccess of AARP.  \n \nLobby power \n \nThe ability to lobby is not dependent on a mass movement and the \ngrowth of existing pensioner's groups in Europe should not be \nunderestimated. There are pensioners groups in all EC countries \n(EurolinkAge,1991; Gifford, 1990) and some of these may yet move \ninto the high profile activist role taken by the Grey Panthers in \nAmerica. While most are not very effective as lobbyists at \nnational level their influence at Community level is bound to \nincrease. \n \nA framework for lobbying \n \nEuropean national political systems do not lend themselves to \nlobbying on the American scale but evidence from Brussels suggests \nthat there is much greater potential for lobbying at the EC level. \nThe potential in Brussels for older people and the European ageing \nenterprise to build up a lobby on the American pattern already \nexists and is developing fast (Fallick, 1990; Gardner, 1991).  \n \nThe development of lobbying is possible because the last few years \nhave seen a very change in competencies at EC level.  Whereas the \nTreaty of Rome made no mention of older people, the Social Charter \n(1989) included them very marginally by noting that every worker \nshould 'be able to enjoy resources affording him or her a decent \nstandard of living' on retirement and that those who need it \nshould be entitled to 'sufficient resources and to medical and \nsocial assistance specifically suited to his needs' (Social \nEurope, 1990: 49-50). The first EC Programme for Older People \nbegan in 1991 with a small budget of  2.2m ECU. Budget increases \nwere exponential in the following two years but slower growth is \nexpected after 1993.  \n \nA European Observatory on Ageing and Older People (see Walker et \nal., 1992, for the first annual report) was set up in 1991. This \nwill henceforth provide one focus for the campaigns of pensioner \ngroups and other national pressure groups. The first meeting of \nthe EC Non-Governmental Organisations Liaison Group, involving \ncross-national pensioners groups, EurolinkAge, Eurag, Fiapa and \nthe European TUC Retired Section also took place in 1991. In 1992 \nthe first European Pensioners Parliament met in Luxembourg. All \nthese activities help to legitimate the claims of older people. \nThey may have relatively little impact on individual governments \nbut they are part of an expanding area of activity in the EC. \nThe designation of 1993 as the European Year of the Elderly and \nIntergenerational Solidarity is another such symbolic gesture. \nNational governments allocate a greater or lesser amount of money \nto support the Year. \n \nThe framework for legislation and legitimation and even for the \nimplementation of a restricted range of initiatives is therefore \nrapidly being strengthened. Court decisions, such and the European \nCourt of Justice ruling in the Barber case (1990) that pensions \nare pay and hence equal pensions should be offered for equal work \nare building a legal, as opposed to a political and \nadministrative, framework. It will further enable older people's \ngroups and the coalitions which support them to extend their \ninfluence and generate legitimacy. Equally legislation and \ndecisions by the ECJ may be expected to increase awareness of \nelder rights and to highlight any cases of social dumping of \npensioners.  \n \nThe expansion of administrative competence may be more difficult \nto achieve as nationalist forces grow in power and countries rely \non the principle of subsidiarity to restrict the growth of EC \ncompetence (see Spicker, 1991). The important area of state \npensions are subject to the principal of subsidiarity and will not \nbe harmonised in the foreseeable future. However moves to \nharmonise private pensions and retirement ages may be more likely \nsince they come under the heading of distortions in the labour \nmarket, and hence can be seen as an area of competence under the \noriginal aims of the Treaty of Rome to establish a free market in \nlabour. Other areas such as rail concessions may be harmonised \nacross Europe, helping to place a framework of entitlements in \nposition which will enhance the sense of common purpose among \nEurope's elders. Equally however such developments may be blocked \nby other governments as they have been by the British. \n \nThe addition of the new concept of 'European citizenship' in the \nSocial Protocol of the Maastricht Treaty opens up much greater \npossibilities for elder rights and claims. As Spicker (1991) \nargues, such citizenship is no longer seen as restricted to those \nwho are in paid work. Older people are unlikely to find themselves \nwith full citizenship overnight but the concept has potential. \nEqually the addition of health as an area of competence under \nMaastricht (Title XVII Public Health) will extend EC competence \ninto an area of vital interest to elders. It is possible in these \ndevelopments to discern parallels with the growth of competence in \nsocial affairs of the US government (Spicker, 1991). \n \nLobby coalitions \n \nSo far, as outlined above, support for the elders lobby has mainly \ncome from NGOs. In America trade unions were an important \nconstituent of the ageing lobby coalition. The role of European \ntrade unions in campaigning for a better deal in old age is \nvariable but nowhere very salient. In Germany unions have been \nconcerned with pensions in terms of deferred pay but have confined \nthemselves to the narrow constituency of indigenous workers. Old \nage poverty for women and gastarbeiter have barely figured on the \nunion agenda. In future there will be scope for union pressure but \ncross-national co-ordination will be needed (Vogel-Polsky and \nVogel, 1991). However such pressure may also come from health and \ncare workers unions as much as from general labour. In the late \nsixties and early seventies, service unions were seen as one of \nthe main pressure groups for better service and higher expenditure \nand they may yet figure as a key actors in the European ageing \nenterprise. In southern Europe all the developments outlined are \nlikely to proceed more slowly. \n \nNew developments \n \nNumbers as political power \n \nThere are three new ingredients in the European situation which \nhave not been identified by American analysts. These are \ndemographic change, change in the position of women and the \ndevelopment of a Europe of the regions. The first is the \ndemographic strength of older people. A public choice model does \nnot necessarily need a fully developed mass movement in order to \ninstigate changes in policy. Sheer numbers and a higher profile \nmay be enough to cause politicians and other policy makers to \nalter their perceptions of the parameters within which they \noperate (Wilson, 1991) in favour of older people. Developments in \nBrussels will reinforce any such trend.  \n \nIn this connection, Kasschau (1978) found, in his studies of \nAmerican policy making, that although political analysts (and no \ndoubt older people themselves), saw elders as too heterogeneous to \nform united interest groups, decision takers saw them as \nhomogenous. This is an important point and one well known to \ngerontologists. Policy makers do tend to see older people as a \nmass and they can be expected to react accordingly if they find \nthey are dealing with large numbers of old people or vocal \npressure groups. The chances are high therefore, that older people \nwill affect policies in areas where they are most numerous even \nthough this effect will be indirect rather than direct via \npolitical representation. \n \nWomen  \n \nSecond there is the possibility that women will become a \nsignificantly greater influence than they are at present.  \nThe issue of population ageing is of great importance for women. \nThey are the primary providers (paid and unpaid) of care at all \nages. As the numbers of very old increase the chances are that \nwomen, at or near retirement age, will have to spend more time \ncaring for frail elders and that this caregiving role may last \nuntil well into their own old age. Women as survivors are more \nlikely to live to be frail. They are therefore the main recipients \nof care as well as the main providers. So far this conjunction has \nhelped to keep informal caregiving off the policy agenda in most \ncountries. Informal care has been seen as something women do \n'naturally'. However there is no reason to think that this \ninvisibility will continue as the number of frail elders rises and \nas the opportunities for paid employment, better incomes and more \nvaried activities increase. Also, in advanced old age, many men \n(husbands) do take on caring responsibilities (Arber ad Gilbert, \n1989) and their contribution should not be forgotten. These \ncaregiving husbands may join politically with the great majority \nof older women who are caregivers and receivers to force some \nchanges in formal caregiving. \n \nTable 3 \n \n \nTable 3 indicates that the proportion of older women among voters \nis already high at around a fifth. It will rise in most countries \ntowards a third if current projections are accurate. It will be \nvery much higher in retirement areas and areas of out migration. \nIn the circumstance it is possible that older women's concerns \nwill remain as invisible as they are at present but it seems \nunlikely that this will be the case.  \n \nIt might be argued that older women are apolitical rather than \npolitical (see Job, 1984 for empirical evidence), and that they \nare less likely than men to vote on any issue, let alone to \ncombine politically. In future however, the drive to increase care \nin the community and so the burdens on carers, which is common to \nall European countries (Abel-Smith 1992), may make some form of \ncaregiver support a necessity. Campaigns, legislation and the \nlegitimisation that a benefit can bring may be expected to \nincrease the political consciousness of older women both as \ncaregivers and care recipients. \n \nSolidarity at regional and local levels \n \nThird, while European political and social conditions may appear \nto be against the growth of national pensioner movements, \nincreased pensioner power at regional and local level is much more \nlikely. Regional ability to by-pass the national capital and lobby \ndirectly in Brussels and Strasbourg is likely to increase \n(Leonardi and Nicoletti, 1990). Regions may vary in their level of \nconcern with older citizens' issues. The figures presented in \nTables 1 and 2 are national totals but conceal wide differences at \nsub-national level. In retirement areas, particularly, it is \npossible to envisage a large population of relatively well \neducated and marginally more affluent pensioners having a strong \ninfluence on local politics and the allocation of resources at a \nlocal level. \n \nTwo scenarios leading to better deals for retired people can be \npostulated. In one retirement migrants make common cause with a \nlocal political party and use their support as a lever for better \nservices. In the second, a public choice model, local parties \ncompete for the votes of pensioners by adopting policies aimed at \ntheir needs. In both cases active retired people may take over \nleadership in local politics. They have the time and increasingly \nthey will be educated and possibly affluent.  \n \nSuch local developments may be strengthened by small scale social \nchanges which could be expected to increase the ability of older \npeople to identify as part of a group: the decrease in family \ncontact through migration; changes in voting patterns as older \npeople become more educated and more willing to vote on age group \nlines; the growth of segregated housing; and cable or satellite \ntelevision programmes targeted on older age groups. In those \ncountries (most) where the relief of poverty is a local government \nissue there will be clear benefits which local politicians can \noffer to impoverished older voters, most of whom will be women.  \n \nThe increased development of regional funds, which will often be \naimed at declining areas where the number of older people is high, \nmay well strengthen the hand of local politicians who want to \nprovide for the majority of their voters (older people). All these \ndevelopments can be seen as helping to raise consciousness in \nareas where old people form the great majority of the electorate. \n \nConclusion \n \nIf the American analysts are right the peak of grey power in \nAmerican has already been passed. The analysis provided by \nWilliams et al and Torres-Gil both indicate 'a shift from \nautomatic legitimacy to political justification for senior citizen \nbenefits' (Torres-Gil 1992: 81). Europe seems very far from that \nstage. \n \nIn Europe older people are handicapped by below average incomes \nand by a strong tendency for younger age groups to perceive them \nas a burden. Pensions are rarely seen as deferred earnings and \nraising pensions is not so far seen as a measure to enable an old \nage which is healthier, more trouble free, and hence a cheaper in \nterms of services. The economic benefits arising from unpaid \nvoluntary work, informal care and self care (a very high consumer \nof personal resources among frail elders), are unlikely to be \nadded to national accounting frameworks in the foreseeable future. \nIt follows that the contribution of older people to national \neconomies will continue to be undervalued and they will continue \nto be seen as a burden by many in the younger policy making \ncohorts.  \n \nHowever there are European developments which could bring about \nchanges in the present allocation of resources between \ngenerations. The results would be to improve the quality of life \nof older people and to bring them nearer full citizenship in old \nage. The framework for legal and social service developments in \nfavour of aged citizens is already being developed in Brussels. \nMore sophisticated lobbying, building on what is already in place, \nis likely to raise consciousness and extend the existing \nframework. Older voters will have a growing political legitimacy \neven if they do not form an identifiable mass movement.  \n \nA Europe of the regions will give greater opportunities for local \npoliticians to bypass national policies and meet local needs for \nbetter conditions for older citizens. The sheer numbers of older \nvoters in some retirement areas will affect political perceptions \neven if there are no political movements specifically organised by \nolder people. The strong tendency of policy makers to perceive \nelders as an undifferentiated mass will indirectly increase their \ninfluence on policy. \n \nThe impact of these changes will be mediated by the strength of \nwomen's movements in the future. The majority of older voters will \nbe women and the majority of very old care recipients will also be \nwomen. It is possible that in countries where the women's movement \nhas little support, the issue of full citizenship for women will \ncontinue to be ignored, and with it the needs of older people. On \nthe other hand in countries, or regions, where the women's \nmovement is strong and where younger and older women make common \ncause it is possible to envisage a real shift towards full \ncitizenship. The result might be greater diversity across Europe \nin the way old people are treated. Alternatively, if policy makers \nconverge on an ideal of citizenship for all, there will be greater \nuniformity, even though the forces for change are unequal between \ncountries. \n \nWhile some might deplore such developments, it is entirely \npossible to argue that policies which are good for elders are good \nfor all citizens over a wide range of government activities. For \nexample Day (1992) lists good public transport, safety in and out \nof doors, accessible parks and other informal meeting places, low \ncost rented housing close to all amenities, and walk-in health and \ncounselling services. These are all improvements which would \nbenefit communities as a whole. Better policies for elders could \nbe seen as a local communal opportunity, even if national \ngovernments are slow to act. \n \nFinally the implication for social policy of enhanced senior power \nare very great. Social policy is traditionally a matter of \ncampaigns, research or administration on behalf of disadvantaged \ngroups. Public policy on the other hand has tended to deal with \nmainstream issues such as defence. If planning and servicing old \nage should become a mainstream matter involving the majority of \nvoting citizens the social policy paradigm would, it is to be \nhoped, undergo a welcome shift. Future European research needs to \naddress the question of whether American experience can or should \nbe repeated and what conditions favour or prevent the development \nof grey power in individual countries.  \n \n \n(1) I would like to thank Brendan O'Duffy for assistance with \npopulation data. \n \nReferences \n \nAbel-Smith, B., (1992), Cost Containment and New Priorities in \nHealth Care, Aldershot, Avebury \n \nAndrews, M., (1991), Life Times of Commitment, Cambridge, \nCambridge University Press \n \nArber, S. and Gilbert, G.N., (1989), 'Men: the Forgotten Carers', \nSociology, 23, 1, 111-118 \n \nBatley.
