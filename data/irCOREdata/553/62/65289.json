This neglect\nis surprising, given that mothers with severe mental\nillness (SMI) are by no means a negligible population\n(McGrath et al. 1999) and that maternal depression and\nanxiety impact negatively on awide range of child out-\ncomes (Murray et al. 1999 ; O\u2019Connor et al. 2002 ; Hay\net al. 2008 ; Pawlby et al. 2009). We know that SMI in the\nparent conveys the greatest risk for the child develop-\ning SMI (Cannon et al. 2002), but beyond interpreting\nsuch intergenerational transfer as evidence for genetic\ninfluence, few studies have addressed other potential\nmechanisms via which parental mental illness may\naffect children\u2019s development. In particular, research\nhas largely neglected the question of how maternal\nSMI relates to the quality of infant\u2013mother interaction.\nAlthough schizophrenia has been linked to poor\nparenting outcomes (Howard et al. 2004 ; Abel et al.\n2005), such conclusions have typically been based\non clinician- or carer-rated measures of parenting\nability or evidence of social services intervention.\nAmong studies involving ratings of videotaped inter-\nactions between infants and mothers with SMI made\nby observers unaware of maternal diagnosis, two\nhave shown that mothers with schizophrenia are re-\nsponsive and affectionate to their infants (Schachter\net al. 1977 ; Sameroff et al. 1982). Others (Riordan et al.\n1999 ; Wan et al. 2007) have found that mothers with\n* Address for correspondence : Dr S.

One reason for\nthe equivocal nature of these findings may be the use\nof global ratings scales to assess interactional quality.\nRecent studies (Wan et al. 2008a, b) involving more\nspecific measures of interactional behaviour continue\nto demonstrate that, compared with mothers with\naffective disorders, mothers with schizophrenia are\nless positively responsive and their speech less infant-\ndirected.\nOne weakness of previous studies has been the\nabsence of healthy comparison groups, making it im-\npossible to establish whether clinical-group behav-\niours differed from expected behaviours in healthy\nparticipants. Pawlby et al. (2005) included a healthy\ncomparison group in studying in-patient mothers\nwith SMI, where videotaped interactions were rated\nby diagnosis-na\u0131\u00a8ve researchers using the Care Index\n(Crittenden, 2004). Compared with a group of healthy\ndyads, mothers with schizophrenia or postpartum\npsychosis were less sensitive and responsive to their\nbabies on admission, but on discharge there were no\ndifferences (Pawlby et al. 2005 ; Pawlby & Fernyhough,\n2009). However, this study still relied on global rating\nscales, making it difficult to identify particular inter-\nactional behaviours that mothers with SMI might find\ndifficult.\nOne relevant facet of early infant\u2013mother interac-\ntion is mind-mindedness (Meins, 1997), operat-\nionalised as caregivers\u2019 ability to \u2018read\u2019 their infants\u2019\ninternal states (Meins et al. 2001 ; Meins & Fernyhough,\n2006). Meins distinguished between appropriate\nmind-related comments indexing the caregiver\u2019s\naccurate reading of the infant\u2019s thoughts or feelings\n(e.g. commenting that the infant is fascinated by a toy\nif he\/she is gazing intently at it for a period of time),\nand non-attuned mind-related comments indicating a\nmisinterpretation of the infant\u2019s internal states (e.g.\nstating that the infant does not want a toy while\nhe\/she is still actively engaged in playing with it).\nCaregiver mind-mindedness in the first year of life\nhas been found to predict infant\u2013caregiver attachment\nsecurity (Meins et al. 2001 ; Lundy, 2003; Arnott &\nMeins, 2007) and children\u2019s theory of mind abilities\nat age 4 years (Meins et al. 2002, 2003).\nWith regard to depressive illness, key features such\nas social withdrawal, impaired concentration, fatigue\nand irritability are likely to prevent caregivers from\n\u2018tuning in\u2019 to their infants\u2019 internal states and engag-\ning in mind-minded discourse. In support of this sug-\ngestion, Murray et al. (1993) reported that, although\ndepression had no effect on the complexity or syntax\nof mothers\u2019 language during face-to-face interactions\nwith their 2-month-olds, depressed mothers were less\nlikely to talk about what the infant was experiencing\nand to assign agency to the infant\u2019s behaviour.\nCognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia\nmay also impact negatively on caregivers\u2019 mind-\nmindedness. For example, patients with schizophrenia\nhave been reported to score lower than healthy con-\ntrols on theory of mind tasks, suggesting a deficit in\ntheir ability to infer people\u2019s thoughts and intentions\nfrom their behaviour (Corcoran et al. 1995). These\ndeficits may carry over into how individuals with\nschizophrenia interact with their infants, leading one\nto predict low levels of mind-mindedness in schizo-\nphrenia.\nThe present study\u2019s first aim was to investigate how\ndifferent types of SMI impact on infant\u2013mother inter-\naction and whether such interactions in mothers with\nSMI differ from those observed in healthy dyads. We\nhypothesized that, compared with healthy women,\nmothers with SMI would demonstrate lower levels\nof mind-mindedness, in terms of (1) few appropriate\ncomments about the infant\u2019s internal states and (2)\nhigh levels of misinterpretations of the infant\u2019s\nthoughts and feelings, and that they would also be (3)\nless responsive and (4) more intrusive. Differences\namong mothers with different diagnoses were also\nexplored, although no directional hypotheses were\nmade.\nExamining infant\u2013mother interaction in an in-\npatient context also allows investigation of interac-\ntional changes as themother\u2019s mental health improves.\nIn a study of in-patient mothers with schizophrenia,\nSnellen et al. (1999) found that an improvement in\nmaternal psychotic symptomatology was associated\nwith an improvement in the quality of infant\u2013mother\ninteraction. Accordingly, we investigated changes in\ninteractional behaviour between admission and dis-\ncharge to a residential mother and baby unit (MBU),\nhypothesizing (5) that levels of mind-mindedness and\nresponsiveness would increase between admission\nand discharge, regardless of diagnosis.\nMethod\nParticipants\nInteractions in 99 infant\u2013mother dyads were observed.\nMothers in 50 of the dyads (60% boys; 42% first born)\nwere a representative sample of in-patients on a MBU.\nThey were observed on two occasions (within 1 week\nof admission when they were unwell and shortly be-\nfore discharge). The MBU is a 12-bedded in-patient\nward where mothers suffering from a severe episode\nof psychiatric illness following childbirth are admitted\nwith their babies (aged 0\u201352 weeks) for treatment. On\nadmission, clinical staff assess the level of risk posed\n1862 S. Pawlby et al.\nby the mother to the child and provide appropriate\nsupport in caring for the baby. In addition to partici-\npating more in the care of their baby as their health\nimproves, mothers are supported in developing their\nrelationship with their babies through video record-\nings of infant\u2013mother interaction, with individually\ntailored feedback with a developmental psychologist.\nAll participants were discharged from the MBU with\ntheir baby after a further videotaped interaction was\nobserved and an assessment by clinicians confirmed\nthat the mother was well enough to return home un-\nder the care of the community psychiatric team.\nDSM-IV diagnoses (APA, 1994) were given retro-\nspectively to each mother by a consultant perinatal\npsychiatrist (G.S.), based on ICD-10 diagnoses and\ndetails from the discharge summaries. Mothers were\nthen assigned to one of three diagnostic groupings\nbased on symptom profile : (1) schizophrenia (DSM-IV\ncodes : 295.30, n=14 ; 295.20, n=1) ; (2) depressive\nmood disorders with or without psychosis, \u2018de-\npression group\u2019 (296.20, n=7; 296.23, n=1 ; 296.24,\nn=2; 296.30, n=2; 296.33, n=5 ; 296.34, n=1 ; 296.54,\nn=2; 298.90, n=3) ; (3) mood disorders where mania\nwas the predominant feature, with or without psy-\nchosis, \u2018mania group\u2019 (296.41, n=1 ; 296.60, n=4;\n298.90, n=7).\nOf 121 admissions to the MBU over a 2-year period,\n82 were eligible to be included in the study. Reasons\nfor exclusion, but not from participating in the video\nfeedback treatment, were : (a) prophylactic admission;\n(b) diagnosis other than the three diagnostic groupings\nselected ; (c) mother\u2019s transfer to an acute ward with-\nout her baby; (d) admission for a parenting assess-\nment ; (e) baby over 12 months on discharge ; (f) use\nof a language other than English in the interaction\nsession.\nOf the 82 eligible mothers and babies, 42 completed\nvideos on admission and discharge, 18 completed one\nvideo only and 22 did not complete any videos.\nAmong mothers with videos completed on admission\nand discharge, seven had a diagnosis of schizo-\nphrenia, 23 had depressive mood disorders with or\nwithout psychosis and 12 had mood disorders where\nmania was the predominant feature, with or without\npsychosis. Participation in both video sessions on ad-\nmission and discharge did not relate to diagnostic\nstatus, suggesting representativeness of the sample.\nHowever, the study participants had longer ad-\nmissions to the ward (mean=13.31 weeks, S.D.=8.07)\ncompared with those not completing two video ses-\nsions (mean=6.25, S.D.=5.04), t (69.27, equal variances\nunassumed)=4.78, p<0.001, suggesting that they may\nhave experienced more severe episodes of illness.\nTo increase the number of participants with a\nschizophrenia diagnosis, we included the next eight\nconsecutive admissions of mothers with schizophrenia\nwith two videotaped sessions on admission and dis-\ncharge. There were no differences in the two groups\nof mothers with schizophrenia in maternal age, social\nclass, ethnicity, infant gender, infant age at admission\nvideo or discharge video or in duration of MBU stay.\nFifty percent of the women were Caucasian, 34%\nwere Black\/Black British, 16% Asian\/Asian British\nand 2% Latin American. Mothers with schizophrenia\nwere less likely to be Caucasian than those in the other\ntwo diagnostic groups. Mothers in the depression\ngroup were more likely to be married\/cohabiting than\nthose in the other two diagnostic groups. Mean infant\nage at admission video was 10.6 weeks, S.D.=8.8,\nrange 2\u201339 and at discharge video 19.1 weeks,\nS.D.=9.8, range 5\u201345. Mean length of admission was\n13.2 weeks, S.D.=7.7, range 1\u201333. No differences ob-\ntained between diagnostic groups on any of these\nvariables (Table 1).\nThe remaining 49 dyads (53% boys ; 56% first born)\nwere drawn from a sample recruited via local health-\ncare professionals on to a separate longitudinal study\nof mind-mindedness and infant\u2013caregiver interaction\nin healthy mothers. Mothers were told that the study\nconcerned individual differences in early infant\u2013\nmother interaction and that the data from the whole\ngroup may be used as a comparison for separate\nsamples of mothers who were experiencing mental\nhealth difficulties. Exclusion criteria for mothers in-\ncluded current treatment for a psychiatric condition or\na history of mental illness. The age, parity and socio-\neconomic status profiles of comparison group mothers\nwere comparable with those of MBU mothers\n(Table 1), but all were Caucasian and married\/\ncohabiting. Comparison dyads were observed when\ninfants were aged 12 weeks.\nFull ethical approval was granted for both studies.\nInformed written consent was obtained for the re-\ncordings of the play sessions to be used for research\nand all procedures were conducted in accordance with\nBritish Psychological Society ethical guidelines.\nMothers with SMI were made aware that they could\nwithdraw at any time without implications for their\ntreatment.\nProcedure\nMothers were invited to make 5-min video recordings\nof an unstructured play session with their baby. In\nMBU mothers, this was during the first week of ad-\nmission or when they were able to give informed\nconsent, and again a few days before discharge fol-\nlowing clinical recovery. Video recordings for both\nclinical and comparison groups were made in\nspecially designed laboratory settings. Infants were\nSevere mental illness and infant\u2013mother interaction 1863\nseated in a baby seat with mothers facing them. No\ntoys were provided. For the dyads observed in the\nMBU, a mirror provided the camera with a full view\nof the mother\u2019s face. For the comparison dyads, split-\nscreen video recording was used. Mothers were in-\nstructed to interact with their infants as they normally\nwould.\nMind-mindedness\nInteractions were transcribed verbatim and mind-\nmindedness was coded from transcripts in conjunc-\ntion with the videotapes using Meins & Fernyhough\u2019s\n(2006) scheme. Each comment containing an internal\nstate term pertaining to the infant was coded di-\nchotomously as either appropriate or non-attuned.\nAppropriate mind-related comments were coded if :\n(a) the coder agreed with the mother\u2019s interpretation\nof the infant\u2019s internal state ; (b) the comment linked\nthe infant\u2019s current activity with similar events in the\npast or future ; (c) the comment served to clarify how\nto proceed if there was a lull in the interaction ; or (d)\nthe mother voiced (using the first person) what the\ninfant might say if he\/she could speak (e.g. \u2018What are\nyou doing, Mummy?\u2019). A coding of non-attuned\nmind-related comments was made if : (a) the coder\nbelieved the mother was misinterpreting her infant\u2019s\ninternal state ; (b) the comment referred to a past\nor future event that had no obvious relation to the\ninfant\u2019s current activity ; (c) the mother asked what the\ninfant wanted to do or commented that the infant\nwanted or preferred a different object or activity, when\nthe infant was already actively engaged in an activity\nor was showing a clear preference for a particular\nobject ; or (d) the referent of the mother\u2019s comment was\nnot clear. Mothers received scores for appropriate\nmind-related comments and non-attuned mind-\nrelated comments expressed as a proportion of the\ntotal number of comments produced during the inter-\naction.\nMaternal responsiveness\nIn addition to coding the interactions for appropriate\nand non-attuned mind-related comments, four further\ndimensions of maternal behaviour were coded: (1)\nmothers\u2019 response to change in infant\u2019s direction of\ngaze (by moving her eyes or head to follow the infant\u2019s\ngaze or commenting on what the infant may be look-\ning at) ; (2) mother seeks infant\u2019s attention (by calling\nthe infant\u2019s name, rapidly moving her face to be in\nthe infant\u2019s line of gaze, clapping hands or snapping\nfingers to attract attention) ; (3) significant pauses\n(>3 s) in the interaction ; (4) mother touches infant.\nHigh scores for (2) and (4) were regarded to index\nmaternal intrusiveness. Scores for all categories of re-\nsponsiveness were expressed as frequencies.\nTable 1.

Pawlby et al.\nInfant behaviours\nIn order to control for the possibility that group dif-\nferences in infant behaviour could underlie any ob-\nserved differences in maternal behaviour across\ndiagnostic groups, two types of infant behaviour were\ncoded: (a) changes in gaze direction (infant changes\nfocus of gaze by moving eyes or head) ; (b) gazes to\nmother. Both categories of infant behaviour were ex-\npressed as frequency scores.\nInter-rater reliability\nVideotapes were coded by two independent trained\nraters who were completely unaware of the study\u2019s\nhypotheses and of the fact that some mothers had a\ndiagnosed mental illness. A randomly selected 20% of\ninteractions were coded by both raters for inter-rater\nagreement. Inter-rater reliabilities for the maternal\nresponsiveness and infant behaviour measures were\ncalculated as intra-class correlations (ICC). For ma-\nternal response to infant direction of gaze, ICC=0.89 ;\nfor maternal attention-seeking, ICC=0.95 ; for signifi-\ncant pauses, ICC=0.99, for mother touching infant,\nICC=0.95. For infant changes in gaze, ICC=0.99 ; for\ninfant gazes to mother, ICC=0.95.\nInter-rater reliability for coding mind-related com-\nments dichotomously as appropriate or non-attuned\nwas k=0.80.\nResults\nMaternal diagnosis and interactional behaviour\nat admission\nInfant gender and maternal ethnicity were both un-\nrelated to all maternal and infant behaviour measures\nand are thus not considered further. Relations be-\ntween mothers\u2019 diagnostic category and maternal\nbehaviours at admission were explored in a series of\none-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with in-\nfant age added as a covariate. Significant main effects\nand post-hoc pairwise comparisons are indicated in\nTable 2.\nThe main effect of diagnostic category on mothers\u2019\nscores for appropriate mind-related comments ap-\nproached significance (p=0.079), with a medium to\nlarge effect (Cohen, 1988) for this relation. Post-hoc\ntests showed a trend (p=0.075) for mothers in the de-\npressed group to be less likely to comment appropri-\nately on their infants\u2019 internal states than mothers in\nthe healthy comparison group.\nFor the main effect of maternal diagnosis on\nmothers\u2019 response to infants\u2019 gaze, the ANCOVA was\nrepeated with infants\u2019 number of gaze changes as an\nadditional covariate. The effect of diagnostic category\nremained significant when infants\u2019 gaze changes were\ncontrolled for [F(3, 90)=3.81, p<0.025], suggesting\nthat group differences were not an artefact of group\ndifferences in gaze changes. The main effect of diag-\nnostic category on maternal attention-seeking behav-\niours also remained when infant gazes to mother\nwere added as an additional covariate [F(3, 90)=4.42,\np<0.01]. There were no group differences in infant\nbehaviours (see Table 2).\nMaternal diagnosis and interactional behaviour\nat discharge\nA series of ANCOVAs compared data from the clinical\ngroups at discharge with those from the comparison\ngroup (recall that the comparison group were ob-\nserved only once). Infant age at observation was\nadded as a covariate. Significant main effects and\npost-hoc pairwise comparisons are shown in Table 3.\nThe main effect of diagnostic category on maternal\nattention-seeking behaviours remained when infant\ngazes to mother were added as an additional covariate\n[F(3, 90)=3.28, p<0.05].\nChanges in infant\u2013mother interaction between\nadmission and discharge\nChanges in both maternal and infant behaviours be-\ntween admission and discharge were investigated\nusing paired t tests. Changes over time are reported\nseparately for each of the three clinical groups in\nTable 4. Alpha was adjusted to 0.005 (0.05\/11) for\nmultiple comparisons. Comparing behaviours at ad-\nmission and discharge for the schizophrenia group,\nmothers talked more to their infants at discharge. For\nthe depressed group, there were no significant differ-\nences between admission and discharge for any of the\nmaternal or infant variables. For the mania group,\nthere were no significant changes in maternal behav-\niour over time, but infants were more likely to look at\nthe mother at discharge compared with admission.\nDiscussion\nOur main aim was to investigate the quality of infant\u2013\nmother interaction, with particular reference to the\nmother\u2019s ability to \u2018read\u2019 her baby\u2019s internal states,\namong mothers with SMI, and to compare this with\nthe quality of interaction observed in psychiatrically\nhealthy mothers. A secondary aim was to investigate\nhow infant\u2013mother interaction in dyads where the\nmother was suffering from SMI changed over the\ncourse of treatment in a residential MBU.\nOn admission to the MBU, there were relatively\nfew differences among mothers in the schizophrenia,\nSevere mental illness and infant\u2013mother interaction 1865\nTable 3.

Pawlby et al.\ndepression and mania groups as indexed by the\nmeasures used here. Mothers in the clinical groups\ndiffered on only one of the seven indices of maternal\ninteractional behaviour, with mothers in the mania\ngroup touching their infants more than did mothers in\nthe schizophrenia group.\nMore differences emerged when the clinical groups\u2019\nadmission data were compared with those of the\nhealthy comparison group. In answer to Hypothesis 1,\nthere was a trend for depressed mothers to be less\nlikely to comment appropriately on their infants\u2019\nthoughts and feelings, with a medium to large effect\n(Cohen, 1988) for this relation, although this trend was\nobserved only on admission and there were no group\ndifferences in non-attuned comments on infants\u2019 in-\nternal states (Hypothesis 2). Contrary to expectations,\nmothers in the schizophrenia group behaved in ways\nmost similar to those observed in the comparison\ngroup (Hypothesis 3). In answer to Hypothesis 4, the\nbehaviour of mothers in both the depression and\nmania groups was more intrusive (indexed by higher\nlevels of attention-seeking and touching the infant)\nthan that of comparison-group mothers both on\nadmission and discharge. While the increased rates\nof intrusive behaviours in the depressed and mania\ngroups are in line with previous findings of reduced\nsensitivity (Murray et al. 1996) and heightened nega-\ntive interactional behaviours (Cohn et al. 1990) in de-\npressed mothers, our findings provide scant support\nfor the hypothesized lower levels of mind-mindedness\nin mothers with SMI and suggest that SMI does not\nautomatically mean that mothers will be more likely to\nmisinterpret their infants\u2019 internal states.\nThe fact that the mind-mindedness coding scheme\nwas developed to assess infant\u2013mother interaction in\npsychologically healthy mothers may be one reason\nwhy we failed to find differences in the clinical groups.\nAnecdotal evidence from the present study suggested\nthat mothers with SMI may have demonstrated non-\nattunement to their infants\u2019 internal states (lower\nlevels of mind-mindedness) in ways that were not\npicked up by the current coding scheme. For example,\none of the mothers with SMI commented in an irri-\ntated voice that her infant \u2018was just fascinated with the\nstrap\u2019 on the baby seat, because the child continued\nto ignore her bids for attention while playing with the\nstrap. Although this mother clearly recognized the\nfocus of her child\u2019s current interest (and was thus\nmaking an appropriate mind-related comment), her\nirritated tone of voice implied that accurately reading\nher infant\u2019s mind could not help her to improve the\nquality of the interaction. Classifying mind-related\ncomments in terms of their emotional tone, and not\nmerely their appropriateness, suggests interesting pos-\nsibilities for adapting the mind-mindedness coding\nscheme for use with clinical populations.\nSchizophrenia-group mothers were the only clinical\ngroup to show a change in interactional behaviour\nbetween admission and discharge (Hypothesis 5) with\nmothers talking more to their infants at discharge.\nNote that this change resulted in schizophrenia-group\nmothers\u2019 scores on discharge being more dissimilar to\nTable 4.

(2007,\n2008a, b). Rather, our findings are in line with those of\nSchachter et al. (1977) and Sameroff et al. (1982), who\nconcluded that mothers with schizophrenia were not\nimpaired in their ability to respond sensitively and\nappropriately to their infants. Pawlby & Fernyhough\n(2009) also showed that, on discharge from in-patient\ncare, mothers with schizophrenia were as sensitive in\ntheir interactions with their babies as were healthy\nmothers with no psychiatric history.\nLimitations\nOne limitation was that the healthy comparison and\nclinical groups were drawn from areas of the UK with\ndifferent ethnic and marital profiles, resulting in\nno ethnic diversity and no single mothers in the\ncomparison group. Another limitation was that com-\nparison-group videos were made only at one time\npoint, when infants were aged 12 weeks. We did,\nhowever, control for infant age in the analyses and\nthere were no effects of ethnicity on our measures.\nAlthough both comparison and clinical groups were\nfilmed in an unfamiliar laboratory setting, the clinical\ngroup had the concomitant stresses of being observed\nwhile unwell (although our impression was that MBU\nmothers were comfortable with the procedure). This\nadditional stress on the MBU mothers makes the fact\nthat we found comparatively few group differences all\nthe more striking. Limitations in the sampling pro-\ncedure include lack of precise detail on why eligible\nmothers did not participate, although we did show\nthat participants were representative of patients ad-\nmitted to the MBU. There was also no formal evalu-\nation of the efficacy of the video-based feedback on the\nquality of mother\u2013infant interaction provided to the\nMBU mothers, which was individually tailored and\nthus varied between dyads\nDischarge videos were not made of mothers who\nunderwent the painful procedure of being discharged\nor transferred from the MBU without their babies.\nAlthough this is a rare occurrence, it does mean that\nthe mothers who did not make sufficient recovery\nto care for their babies were not included in the\nstudy. Future research should therefore investigate\nwhether mothers who lose custody of their infants\nhave different mind-mindedness and responsiveness\nprofiles from those observed here. Another limitation\nis the lack of a formal measure assessing mothers\u2019\nsymptoms and general functioning on admission or\non discharge. Future studies might ask how indi-\nvidual symptoms or clusters of symptoms, including\nmeasures of their severity, might impact on a mother\u2019s\ninteraction with her baby.\nConclusion\nThe main implication of this study is that comparisons\nwith healthy controls show that mothers with SMI,\nparticularly those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia,\nare able to be mind-minded and responsive when in-\nteracting with their babies. It is of crucial importance,\ntherefore, to gain knowledge of normative levels of\ninteractional behaviour and not assume, as has often\nbeen the case in studies only comparing diagnostic\ngroups, that higher frequencies of mother and infant\nbehaviours (e.g. infant-directed speech) are necess-\narily optimal. This knowledge can then be used to in-\nform any intervention aimed at improving the quality\nof infant\u2013mother interaction in mothers with different\ntypes of mental illness.\nAcknowledgements\nThis study was supported by ESRC grant reference\nRES-000-22-0395.
