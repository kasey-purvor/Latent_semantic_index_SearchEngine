Experiments  were  carried  out  with  various \nliquids to determine the effect of \uf062 on the substrate velocity at which air is entrained \ninto the liquid. It was observed that as this angle departs from zero, air entrainment is \ndelayed  to  higher  speeds.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe principle of all coating operations is that air in contact with a dry solid substrate is \ndisplaced by a liquid film. At low substrate speeds a uniform film is formed but as the \nspeed  increases,  air  is  entrained  between  the  coating  and  the solid and spoils  the \nquality of the coating which becomes mared with bubbles. When the coating dries, \nthese bubbles leave defects on the final coated product which becomes wasted. This \nphenomenon  is  observed  in  all  coating  processes  and  is  one  of  the  most  serious \nlimitation to coating operations where high throughput and absolute uniformity are \nrequired.  \n \nThe study of air entrainment in coating flows has largely been based on dip coating \nexperiments where a smooth flat substrate is plunged into a large pool of stagnant \nliquid, a simple flow situation which attempts to extract the essence of the problem at \nthe three phase, solid \/ liquid \/ gas contact line in more complex coating flows. Such a \nflow reveals that the free surface of the liquid intersects the solid substrate along the \nwetting line and forms with it the dynamic contact angle measured through the liquid \n                                                            \n1 corresponding author : Tel (01274) 383721 Fax (01274) 385700 Email H.Benkreira@bradford.ac.uk   2 \nas shown in fig. 1. As the speed of the substrate is increased, the wetting line moves \ndownward  and  the  contact  angle  increases  until  it  approaches  180\u00b0  at  the  critical \nvelocity Vae. Detailed descriptions of the mechanism of air entrainment have been \ngiven by O'Connell (1989), Burley (1992), and Veverka (1995), but Deryagin and \nLevi (1964) noted first that when the critical velocity is reached, the dynamic wetting \nline  which  is  originally  straight  and  horizontal  becomes  unsteady  and  breaks  into \nstraight-line segments that are inclined from the horizontal. At any instant, the wetting \nline has an appearance of sawteeth (fig. 2), and air is entrained at the trailing vertices \nwhere two straight-line segments seem to intersect. This phenomenon is termed gross \nair entrainment to contrast it with the microscopic regime of air entrainment which \nwas observed by Miyamoto and Scriven (1982) and Miyamoto (1991) at speeds lower \nthan Vae. Gross air entrainment only will be considered in this paper. \n \nMany attempts have been made to correlate the critical velocity Vae with the properties \nof the fluid and the substrate involved. Buonoplane et al.(1986) concluded from their \nexperiments that substrate roughness leads to higher critical velocities, as was inferred \npreviously by Scriven (1982). They also showed that surface wettability has little or \nno effect. Using smooth substrates, Burley and Kennedy (1976) derived the following \nempirical correlation, \n \n  V\ng\nae \uf0bb\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf02d\n677\n0 5 0 67\n.\n. .\n\uf06d\n\uf072\uf073\n              [1] \n \nwhereas Burley and Jolly (1984) obtained \n \n  V\ng\nae \uf0bb\n\uf0e6\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e7\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f7\n\uf0e9\n\uf0eb\n\uf0ea\n\uf0ea\n\uf0f9\n\uf0fb\n\uf0fa\n\uf0fa\n\uf02d\n705\n0 5 0 77\n.\n. .\n\uf06d\n\uf072\uf073\n              [2] \n \nHere g is the gravity constant, and\uf020\uf06d\uf02c\uf020\uf073\uf02c and\uf020\uf072\uf020are the viscosity, the surface tension \nand  the  density  of  the  liquid,  respectively.  Being  dimensionally  inconsistent,  both \neqs. [1] and [2] are written here in c.g.s. units. Dimensionless correlations were also \ngiven, but the lack of readily accessible characteristic length weakens their practical \ninterest. \n \nGutoff and Kendrick (1982) found experimentally that viscosity was the sole relevant \nparameter, and then proposed the correlation \n \n  Vae \uf0bb\n\uf02d 511\n0 67 .\n. \uf06d                 [3] \n \nin which Vae is expressed in cm\/s and \uf06d in mPa.s. Their data were in good agreement \nwith eqs. [1] and [2] as both surface tension and density are second order parameters \nand are unlikely to vary significantly in practical situations. \n \n \nBlake and Ruschak (1979) observed the geometry of the sawteeth shaped wetting line \nat speeds higher than Vae and established that the component of the speed normal to   3 \nthe  straight-line  segments  of  the  wetting  line  was  independent  of  the  substrate \nvelocity. They termed this component, the maximum speed of wetting, V* which they \nassumed is the maximum speed at which the wetting line can advance normal to itself. \nThey observed that the substrate could be wet at speeds V higher than V* only if the \nwetting line slanted so that the speed of the solid normal to it did not exceed the \nmaximum  speed  of  wetting.  More  specifically,  they  found  that  the  wetting  line \nsegments adopted the minimum possible inclination \uf046 such that \n \n  cos \uf046 = V*\/ V   (V \uf0b3 V*),            [4] \n \nsee fig. 2. This would explain the break-up of the wetting line into a sawteeth pattern \nand the subsequent occurrence of air entrainment at the point where two straight-line \nsegments seem to intersect. The observation of a maximum speed at which a three-\nphase contact line can advance normal to itself has been also reported by Petrov and \nSedev  (1985)  who  investigated  the  similar  phenomenon  of  dewetting.  Theoretical \nsupport of these observations has been given later by Blake (1993) and Shikhmurzaev \n(1993). \n \nBlake and Ruschak (1979) pointed out that the existence of a maximum speed of \nwetting would imply that the break-up of the wetting line, hence the occurrence of air \nentrainment could be postponed to velocities Vae greater than V* provided that the \nsubstrate  does  not  enter  the  bath  vertically.  They  claimed  to  have  observed  this \nexperimentally  but  surprisingly  did  not  substantiate  this  important  argument  with \nexperimental data. Since then, the possible influence of the angle at which the solid \nplunges into the liquid has been much debated. Burley and Jolly (1984) found that the \ncritical velocities did not change with the angle of entry, although they could observe \nslight differences between the two sides of the tape. They concluded that Blake and \nRuschak's (1979) analysis was incorrect (Burley, 1992). However, they did not realise \nthat they had considered the effect of a different angle (\uf061 in fig. 3a). In their set-up, \nthe  substrate,  though  inclined,  intersected  the  fluid  perpendicularly  to  its  motion \n(fig. 3a) whereas in the arrangement of Blake and Ruschak (1979) the substrate must \nbe  inclined  at  an  angle  \uf062  in  another  dimension,  so  that  the  wetting  line  is  not \nperpendicular to the direction of substrate motion, as depicted in fig. 3b. The same \nerror was made by Ghannam and Esmail (1990) who studied the case of a rotating \ncylinder partially immersed in a liquid pool. They could vary the angle of entry by \nraising or lowering the roller axis. Contrary to Burley and Jolly (1984), they found the \nair entrainment velocity to depend significantly on the angle of entry, and mistakenly \nconcluded  that  their  results  were  in  agreement  with  the  predictions  of  Blake  and \nRuschak (1979). So far then, the simple yet fundamental effect of having the angle \nformed  by  the  wetting  line  and  the  substrate  velocity  vector  different  from  90\u00b0 \n(fig. 3b) has not been tested experimentally comprehensively and conclusively. This is \nprecisely the aim of this paper. \n \n \n2. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP \n \nThe  experimental  apparatus  is  depicted  schematically  in  fig.  4.  A  50  mm  wide \npolypropylene  tape  was  drawn  downwards  through  a  perpex  tank  containing  the \nliquid.  The  tape  passed  over  grounded  metal  rollers  to  reduce  any  static  charges   4 \n(Burley and Jolly, 1984), plunged into the liquid, emerged from a narrow slit at the \nbottom of the tank and was finally wound around a cylinder driven by a variable speed \nmotor. This design prevented the fluid carried along the substrate from flowing back \nand entraining air bubbles into the tank. Additional liquid was supplied regularly to \nthe tank to compensate for the amount entrained out of the pool by the substrate. \n \nThe whole system, including the tank and the motor, was rather compact, the inter-\naxes distance between the feed reel and the take-up reel being approximately 55 cm. It \nwas mounted on a stainless steel frame that could pivot sideways. While remaining is \nthe vertical plane, the tape could be inclined laterally up to 55\u00b0 from the vertical by \nincrements of 5\u00b0. The height of the tank ensured that the depth of the liquid was at \nleast 5 cm even at the maximum inclined angle. \n \nThree glycerine-water solutions and one vegetable oil were used as Newtonian test \nfluids. Their viscosities were measured to an accuracy of \u00b1 5% with a Brabender \nRheotron  rheometer  equipped  with  a  Couette  geometry.  Surface  tensions  were \nmeasured to within \u00b1 2 % using the pendent drop method. The physical properties of \nthe liquid used are listed in table 1. \n \nThe  tape  velocities  were  measured  with  an  optically  triggered  digital  tachometer \nmounted  on  one  of  the  rollers.  All  the  experiments  were  conducted  at  room \ntemperature, that is between 20 and 25\u00b0C. The physical properties of the liquids were \nmeasured at the temperature recorded during the coating experiments, which did not \nvary significantly during the processing of each individual liquid. \n \n \n3. DETERMINATION OF THE ONSET OF AIR ENTRAINMENT \n \nThe onset of air entrainment was determined by slowly increasing the tape velocity \nuntil the break-up of the wetting line into a sawteeth pattern could be observed. The \nspeed  reached  was  then  recorded  as  the onset of air entrainment.  Whether or not \nvisible air bubbles were actually dragged into the liquid from the tip of the v-shapes \nwas not considered. The reason is that the entrainment of air bubbles into the liquid is \nmuch more difficult to detect than the break-up of the wetting line, which could be \neasily  observed  with  the  naked  eye  under  proper  illumination.  It  was  therefore \nassumed that the break-up of the wetting line and the onset of air entrainment were \nconfounded, which may be not rigorously the case in practise (Burley, 1992 ; Veverka \nand Aidun, 1997). In order to reduce experimental errors, each data point was repeated \nat least four times. In spite of the relative crudeness of the experimental method, the \ndiscrepancies between individual and averaged data was always found to be less than \n\u00b1 10%, being even less than \u00b1 7% in most cases. \n \n \n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n4.1. Air entrainment velocity for a vertical tape \n \nIn order to validate the experimental technique, the experimental values of the onset \nof  air  entrainment  obtained  with  a  vertical  tape  (\uf062  =  0)  were  compared  with  the   5 \npredictions of Burley and Kennedy (1976), Burley and Jolly (1984), and Gutoff and \nKendrick (1982). The results are shown in figs. 5 and 6. The correlation of Burley and \nJolly (1984) fits our data best. The agreement with Gutoff and Kendrick\u2019s (1982) \ncorrelation, is less good, probably because both surface tension and density, which \nplay a role albeit a minor one, do not enter in their correlation. It is worth noting that \nfor the glycerine solutions n\nos 2 and 3 of high densities and surface tensions, the air \nentrainment velocities are greater than predicted by Gutoff and Kendrick\u2019s correlation, \nwhereas for the vegetable oil of low density and surface tension, the air entrainment \nvelocity  is  lower  than  predicted.  With  the  glycerine  solution  n\no  1,  which  has  the \nhighest viscosity, the observed air entrainment speed is in very good agreement with \nthe prediction. This confirms that viscosity is the dominant parameter and that the air \nentrainment velocity increases with both density and surface tension. \n \n \n4.2. Air entrainment velocity for a laterally inclined tape \n \nWith  the  four  liquids  tested,  the  air  entrainment  velocity  was  found  to  increase \nsignificantly  as  the  tape  axis  departed  from  the  vertical.  For  instance,  the  air \nentrainment velocity at \uf062\uf0a0 = 55\u00b0 was measured to be about 1.75 times that obtained \nfor \uf062\uf0a0 = 0 (vertical tape). A typical result is shown in fig. 7 for glycerine solution n\no 2. \n \nAccording to Blake and Ruschak (1979), the break-up of the wetting line should occur \nwhen  the  component  of  the  tape  velocity  normal  to  the  horizontal  exceeds  the \nmaximum speed of wetting V*. The air entrainment velocity for a given angle \uf062 is \nthen expected to verify \n \n  Vae\uf020= V*\/cos \uf062                [5] \n \nwhere  V*  is  the  air  entrainment  velocity  at  \uf062\uf0a0 = 0.  Eq.  [5]  can  be  rewritten  in  a \ndimensionless form as \n \n  Vae\uf020cos \uf062\uf020\/ V* = 1.                [6] \n \nThe experimental data obtained for the four liquids used were tested against eq. [6]. \nThe results are shown in fig. 8. Regardless of the liquid involved, it can be seen that \nthe data follow the predictions of Blake and Ruschak (1979) fairly well, the scattering \nof the data being of same order as the experimental uncertainties (\u00b1 10%). This shows \nthat the speed which is relevant in the dynamic wetting process is not the velocity of \nthe substrate itself but its component normal to the wetting line. \n \nAnother evidence of this arises from the observation of the sawteeth shaped wetting \nline  at  speeds  greater  than  Vae  and  for\uf020\uf062  \uf0b9  0.  Not  surprisingly,  the  triangular  air \npockets which were observed throughout the experiments were no longer symmetrical \nfor\uf020\uf062 \uf0b9 0. In full agreement with Blake and Ruschak (1979) indeed, they formed in \nsuch a way that both sides of the v-shapes formed the same angle with the substrate \nvelocity vector (fig. 9).

CONCLUDING REMARKS \n \nThis  work  has  provided  new  experimental  evidence  of  the  existence,  for  a  given \nsolid \/ liquid \/ gas  system,  of  a  maximum  speed  of  wetting  understood  as  the \nmaximum speed at which a dynamic wetting line can advance normal to itself in dip-\ncoating experiments. As pointed out by Blake and Ruschak (1979), this could explain \nthe break-up of the wetting line into a sawteeth pattern when the critical velocity is \nreached and the subsequent air entrainment at the tip of the v-shapes. However, it \nshould be emphasised that our experiments do not give any insight on the physical \norigin of the maximum speed of wetting. Blake (1993) derived a molecular kinetic \ntheory of dynamic wetting in which the maximum speed of wetting appears to be of \nnon-hydrodynamic origin. On the other hand, high-speed visualisations of the contact \nline (Veverka, 1995) suggest that the formation of triangular air pockets at Vae is \nactually of hydrodynamic origin (Veverka and Aidun, 1997). In addition, there are \nconsiderable evidence that the critical speed for air entrainment depends strongly on \nthe flow field in the liquid phase (Perry, 1967 ; Blake et al., 1994 ; Veverka, 1995). In \nour experiments, inclining the substrate with respect to the vertical altered not only the \nangle formed by the wetting line and the substrate velocity vector but also the air and \nliquid flow fields near the contact line. This could also explain the effect of substrate \nlateral inclination in delaying the onset of air entrainment. \n \nThe existence of a maximum speed of wetting as defined above implies that the speed \nwhich is relevant to air entrainment in coating operations is not the velocity of the \nsubstrate itself but its component normal to the wetting line. Using this fact, a simple \nand efficient way has been proposed to postpone the occurrence of air entrainment to \nhigher substrate speeds. It is based on having the angle formed by the wetting line and \nthe substrate velocity different from 90\u00b0. In dip coating, where a continuous dry tape \nenters a large pool of liquid, this was achieved by inclining the substrate laterally in \nthe vertical plane. It has been shown experimentally that the air entrainment velocity \nis multiplied by the expected factor 1\/cos\uf062 when the tape is laterally inclined by an \nangle \uf062 from the vertical. \n \nIn practical terms, this means that a gain of about 75 % on the coating speed can be \nachieved by inclining the substrate laterally by an angle of 55\u00b0 from the vertical, as \nwas  found  experimentally.  It  is  clear,  however,  that  having  the  substrate  inclined \nsideways would pose problems in industrial practise. Nevertheless, the principle of \nslanting the wetting line to delay the onset of air entrainment should be applicable \nmore easily to pre-metered coating methods such as curtain coating and extrusion \ncoating where this may be done by inclining the coating head instead of the substrate. \nTesting this idea and its consequences on the coating thickness and the stability of the \nflow is currently under investigation. \n \n \n6.
