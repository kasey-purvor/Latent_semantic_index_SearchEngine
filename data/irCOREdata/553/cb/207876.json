It is widely acknowledged that private actors play an increasing role in\nglobal environmental politics. Corporations lobby states during negotiations\non multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs), featuring prominently in\nthe implementation of international accords. They also interact with each other,\nas well as with states and other nonstate actors, to create institutional arrange-\nments that perform environmental governance functions. The rise of such pri-\nvate forms of global governance raises a number of questions for the study of\nglobal environmental politics: How does private governance interact with state-\ncentric governance? In what ways are the roles\/capacities of states and nonstate\nactors affected by private governance? Does the rise of private governance sig-\nnify a shift in the ideological underpinnings of global environmental gover-\nnance? This article explores these questions, seeking a better understanding of\nthe signi\u00aacance of private environmental governance (PEG) for International\nRelations.\nPrivate Environmental Governance and Globalization\nIt is widely recognized that \u201cgovernance without government\u201d1 is a reality in\nworld politics. While this claim is relatively uncontroversial in the case of inter-\nnational regimes created by states, the role of private actors in international gov-\nernance has been subject to debate. Growing numbers of scholars argue for the\nexistence of \u201csocial choice mechanisms\u201d2 ranging from decentralized and self-\nregulatory to more centralized, hierarchical forms of governance. \u201cPrivate gover-\nnance\u201d emerges at the global level where the interactions among private actors,\nor between private actors on the one hand and civil society and state actors on\nthe other, give rise to institutional arrangements that structure and direct actors\u2019\n* The author thanks the editors of this special issue and two anonymous reviewers for helpful\ncomments.\n1.

These structuring effects resemble the \u201cpub-\nlic\u201d governing functions of states and intergovernmental institutions, and for\nthis reason the notion of governance, and indeed authority, has been applied to\nprivate actors.3\nPrivate governance needs to be distinguished from mere cooperation\nbetween private actors. Cooperation requires the adjustment of individual be-\nhavior to achieve mutually bene\u00aacial objectives,4 and between private actors is a\npervasive phenomenon in the global economy. It is mostly of an ad hoc nature\nwith a short lifetime. Governance, however, emerges out of a context of interac-\ntion that is institutionalized and of a more permanent nature. In a system of\ngovernance, individual actors do not constantly decide to be bound by the insti-\ntutional norms based on a calculation of their interest, but adjust their behavior\nout of recognition of the legitimacy of the governance system. Cooperation may\nlead to governance, but more is required than the spontaneous convergence of\nprivate actors\u2019 interests via the coordinating function of markets.\nPrivate governance has been documented in many global economic sec-\ntors.5 It is also increasing in global environmental protection, at the level of in-\ndividual \u00aarms, industries and cross-sectoral organizations. For example, the US\nChemical Manufacturers Association, together with its Canadian counterpart,\ndeveloped the so-called Responsible Care program in the 1980s to promote en-\nvironmental and safety principles and codes of management practice within the\nglobal chemical industry. Through the market clout of American MNCs such as\nDuPont and Dow, Responsible Care has been exported to a number of develop-\ning countries, becoming an important benchmark for developing good practice\nin the chemical industry.6 Likewise, the International Organization for Stan-\ndardization (ISO) created a global standard for environmental management\nsystems (EMS) that provides guidance in the development of environmental\nmanagement across many industrial sectors and allows individual companies to\nseek certi\u00aacation. This \u201cISO 14000 series\u201d has been adopted globally by corpo-\nrations and regulatory agencies and has become the dominant reference point\nfor developing national or industry-wide EMS.7\nWhile interest in private governance has grown more recently, the active\ninvolvement of private actors in global governance is not entirely new. Private\nactors played a substantial role in ordering transnational economic relations in\nthe 19th century, but in the 20th century, with the expansion of the state\u2019s regula-\ntory role, \u00aarst domestically, subsequently in the international system, the provi-\nsion of global governance came to be associated primarily with public authori-\nties. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the re-emergence of private governance is closely\nrelated to late-20th century processes of economic globalization and the corre-\nsponding restructuring of state functions.\nRobert Falkner \u2022 73\n3. Cutler, Hau\u00baer, and Porter 1999.\n4. Keohane 1984.\n5. See Braithwaite and Drahos 2000; Hau\u00baer 2001; and Cutler, Hau\u00baer, and Porter 1999.\n6. See Garcia-Johnson 2000.\n7. Cascio, Woodside, and Mitchell 1996.\nThe literature on globalization has thus provided a major vantage point\nfor the study of private governance and authority. Authors such as Susan Strange\nand DeAnne Julius,8 and the polemic depiction by anti-globalization campaign-\ners of a globalized economy out of control,9 suggest the process of globalization\nis intimately linked with a transfer of power and authority from the public to\nthe private sector. What is missing in this perspective, however, is a better under-\nstanding of the more precise connections that exist between globalization and\nthe changing role of private actors.10 In reviewing the debate on PEG, this article\nargues that, while the existing literature in International Relations (IR) rightly\nemphasizes the growing importance of new types of actors in global environ-\nmental governance (business actors and social movements) it overstates their\nautonomy, and underplays the high degree of variation within each type of ac-\ntor. The following discussion stresses the importance of the relationship of these\nnew actors to other actors and examines three particular claims arising in the\ncontext of globalization studies. Each claim suggests that the rise of PEG\namounts to a transformational trend in global governance.\nThe \u00aarst claim concerns the relationship between globalization and the\nperceived decline of the nation-state. In this view, private governance indicates a\nlong-term shift away from state-centric models of governance to new forms of\nauthority located in the global economy, with private actors emerging as the\nnew sovereigns. Susan Strange, for example, has argued that over the last two de-\ncades \u201cthe powers of most states have declined still further, so that their author-\nity over the people and their activities inside their territorial boundaries has\nweakened.\u201d At the same time, \u201cnon-state authorities . . . have impinged more\nand more on those people and their activities.\u201d11 Authors working within this\nperspective emphasize the process of deterritorialization of global governance\nas a consequence of globalization and challenge the traditional dominance of\nstate-centric regime theory in the study of global environmental politics (see\nPaterson, Humphreys and Pettiford, this volume).\nA second, related, claim links the emergence of private governance with\ntransnationalism and growth in global civil society. The latter is seen to support\n\u201cactivities that shape widespread behavior and in\u00bauence the way public issues\nare addressed.\u201d12 Private governance is thus a direct result of pressure exerted by\nactivist groups on corporations. It has become an important instrument in the\npolitical toolbox of global civil society in its efforts to promote environmental\nsustainability. Both the \u201cstate in decline\u201d school and the transnationalist ap-\nproach contribute to the emergence of a \u201cglocalization\u201d perspective on global\ngovernance (see Paterson, Humphreys and Pettiford, this volume), which sees\n74 \u2022 Private Environmental Governance and International Relations\n8.

Governance is no longer identi\u00aaed solely, or\neven primarily, with the regime-building activities of states. Instead, multilevel\nsites of governance emerge out of interactions within the states- system, global\ncivil society and the global economy.\nA third, alternative, conceptualization of private governance is found in\ncritical political economy. Following a neo-Gramscian analysis, capitalist forces\nare seen to be engaging in alliance building processes with a variety of state and\ncivil society actors in an effort to realign the ideological and material bases of\nthe dominant hegemonic order.13 The rise of private governance signi\u00aaes a new\nphase in the ongoing process of re-structuring global hegemony, in which\nglobal \u00aarms organize to establish environmental standards with a view to shift-\ning the ideological focus in global environmental politics in the direction of\nmarket-oriented, deregulatory systems of governance. The emergence of corpo-\nrate-sponsored environmental regimes thus points to an ideological shift in or-\nganizing international responses to the ecological crisis, that ultimately helps to\ncement the grip by the dominant class over anti-systemic forces.\nThese three perspectives raise important questions about the signi\u00aacance\nof PEG for understanding international order and change, suggesting a pro-\nfound change in the way it is organized. This change affects the roles of states\nand nonstate actors alike, causing a power shift from the former to the latter.\nFurthermore, if private governance is indeed becoming more prevalent in global\nenvironmental politics, then the possibility of a fundamental shift in the ideo-\nlogical underpinnings of international environmentalism needs to be consid-\nered. In the following, these perspectives are examined and the impact of private\nforms of governance on the roles of states and nonstate actors, as well as the\nideological basis for global environmental action, are investigated. I argue that\nwhile important changes in the international political economy can be noted,\nthe above perspectives overstate the transformational impact of PEG.\nSupplanting, or Complementing, State Authority?\nA key question in the study of PEG concerns the relationship between private\nactors and states. It can be argued that the rise of private forms of governance is\nintimately linked with a decline in state power and results from the failure of\nthe states-system adequately to govern the global commons. In this perspective,\nthe signi\u00aacance of PEG lies in the support it lends to those arguing for the aban-\ndonment of the traditional state-centric model.\nConventional studies of international environmental politics have viewed\nglobal governance as a function provided primarily by the states-system,\nthrough processes of international negotiations and regime building. Environ-\nmental scholars were among the \u00aarst to point to the eminent role that nonstate\nRobert Falkner \u2022 75\n13. Cox 1987; and Gill 1993. See also Ford, this volume.\nactors play in promoting global norms and pressuring states into action. But\nprivate actors are usually conceptualized as lobbyists seeking to in\u00bauence state-\ncentric processes of regime-building. In some cases, private actors have exerted a\nconsiderable degree of in\u00bauence over outcomes, either supporting or hindering\nprogress towards effective environmental governance, as witnessed in the cases\nof ozone layer protection and climate change respectively.14 But despite the\ngrowing recognition of the involvement of private actors, the conventional no-\ntion of governance remains \u00aarmly embedded in a state-centric setting, insisting\nthat effective governance depends on state authority in establishing and imple-\nmenting international regimes.\nViewed against this background, the emergence of private governance\nposes a challenge to established understandings of the relationship between\nstates and private actors. This argument is central, for example, to Rosenau\u2019s no-\ntion of a multi-centric world which is contrasted with the state-centric world of\ninternational politics.15 Recent writings in the \u00aaeld of private governance suggest\na whole range of institutional arrangements at the global level that fall into this\ncategory of a multi-centric world. Hau\u00baer, for example, has analyzed the emer-\ngence of \u201cprivate regimes\u201d within the oligopolistic market structure of the\nglobal insurance industry.16 Others have highlighted the international authority\nacquired by telecommunications companies, accountancy \u00aarms, credit rating\nagencies and so on.17\nArguments of this kind provide fertile ground for exploring the new reality\nof global environmental governance. A problem, however, is that what might be\ncalled the \u201cpure\u201d form of private governance (governance outside the realm of\nthe states-system) is of only limited empirical and conceptual relevance. For\nmost instances of PEG are of the kind that are better described as \u201cmixed\u201d re-\ngimes, where \u201cthe boundary between public and private spheres is blurred.\u201d18\nHybrid private-public governance emerges out of the interactions of private ac-\ntors, either with the involvement of states or with the later adoption, or cod-\ni\u00aacation, by states and\/or intergovernmental organizations. States are not the\ndriving force behind the creation of such governance systems, but lend them\nstrength through of\u00aacial recognition or incorporation into international law.\nThis mixed nature of PEG can be seen in the case of the ISO 14000 series.19\nIn the early 1990s, a cross-sectoral group of corporate and legal experts from\naround the world began drafting this global environmental management sys-\ntem (EMS), eventually adopted in 1995. Although the ISO 14000 has a mix of\nprivate and public sector members, its drafting was dominated by business rep-\n76 \u2022 Private Environmental Governance and International Relations\n14.

On the role of the ISO 14000 series in global forests governance, see Humphreys, this volume.\nresentatives and re\u00baects the interests of large multinational corporations. ISO\n14000 is intended to become the global standard that would allow multina-\ntional \u00aarms to apply an EMS across their transnational operations to reduce\ntransaction costs.20\nISO 14000 standards have already proved to be a successful tool in per-\nsuading industries around the world to seek ISO certi\u00aacation for their EMS.\nHowever, they derive particular strength from the fact that states and interna-\ntional organizations have recognized the ISO standards and lent them addi-\ntional legitimacy. Several countries, particularly in East Asia and Europe, have\nadopted ISO 14000 as their of\u00aacial standards; governments are expected to in-\ncorporate them into their procurement and international bodies such as the\nWTO have recognized the voluntary ISO standards as international standards\nunder the WTO system and as being consistent with the Technical Barriers to\nTrade Agreement.21\nThus, private regimes such as ISO standards gain in strength and legiti-\nmacy because they are adopted by states and international organizations. More\noften than not, they are hybrid regimes created by transnational policy networks\nconsisting of industry representatives and regulatory of\u00aacials. They exist outside\nthe states-system only insofar as the international community has not set com-\nparable standards. States do, however, exercise considerable in\u00bauence over such\nprivate forms of governance in that they tolerate, and even encourage, their cre-\nation and maintenance by the private sector. Simplistic dichotomies between\nprivate and public regimes do not help in understanding the dynamics involved\nin PEG.\nThe idea that PEG may supplant or undermine the governance function of\nthe states-system is also called into question by the fact that many private re-\ngimes are bene\u00aacial to states in leaving the burden of implementation in the\nhands of the private sector. States may actually choose to let industry establish\nsystems of self-regulation where there is no overriding demand for public regu-\nlation. In these cases, states are saved from the often complex task of negotiating\ninternational standards and do not pay the costs of implementation and com-\npliance. Rather than suffering from a lack of state capacity, as much of the glob-\nalization literature suggests, states can therefore be seen to be bene\u00aating from\nthe more widespread use of private governance mechanisms.\nFinally, claims about the \u201cstate in decline\u201d are misleading in not distin-\nguishing between different states and differential ways in which they are af-\nfected by private sector governance. The power of \u00aarms clearly has a more con-\nstraining effect on the autonomy of the state in developing countries than in the\nindustrialized world. And in the case of PEG, a similar case can be made for\narguing that it is primarily developing countries that are left with little capacity\nRobert Falkner \u2022 77\n20. See Hau\u00baer 1995, 36\u201338; for a critical view see Gleckman and Krut 1996.\n21.

First, standard setting agencies from the developing world were\nunder-represented in the drafting of the management standard and were\nthus unable to push for a discussion of issues related to technology transfer and\na phase-in period for developing countries. Second, some developing countries,\nparticularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, faced considerable dif\u00aaculties in\naccessing relevant information about new environmental standards.22\nNorth-South inequality in the setting and implementation of private stan-\ndards is ubiquitous. Developing country interests regularly \u00aand themselves\nmarginalized. Maintaining a suf\u00aacient level of involvement for state actors,\nbased on UN-style representation, will therefore be crucial for developing coun-\ntries in their efforts to redress imbalances in international environmental\npolicy-making. This is not to say that problems of North-South inequality do\nnot plague the state-centric forums of environmental governance, but tradi-\ntional forums of international policy-making provide Southern states at least\nwith formal equality in the representation of their interests. Furthermore, devel-\noping countries have managed to improve their bargaining position in more re-\ncent MEA negotiations, for example in securing additional funding for comply-\ning with MEAs,23 and in pushing for regulatory standards that were initially\nopposed by industrialized countries.24\nThis does not claim nothing has changed in the relationship between\n\u00aarms and states; the rise in PEG undoubtedly enhances the position and legiti-\nmacy of corporations in GEP. Whether it reduces the power of states at the same\ntime, or signi\u00aaes an erosion in state capacity, is another question; it cannot be\nanswered in a simple and straightforward manner, but requires more careful\nanalysis of the changing conditions of \u201cstateness\u201d (the institutional centrality of\nthe state) in an era of globalization.25 It seems clear, however, that the simplistic\ndichotomy between government and market, and between state-centric and\nnon-state-centric governance at global level, is not helpful in trying to under-\nstand the changing dynamics of global environmental governance.\nEmpowering, or Usurping, Global Civil Society?\nA second set of questions concerns the way in which private governance affects\nthe opportunities for civil society actors in shaping global governance. The focus\nhere is on the interaction between corporations and the environmental move-\n78 \u2022 Private Environmental Governance and International Relations\n22. Clapp 1998, 306\u2013308.\n23. Jordan 1994.\n24. This was the case in the biosafety negotiations. See Falkner 2000; and Bail, Falkner, and\nMarquard 2002.\n25. Evans 1997.\nment, particularly the latter\u2019s attempts to change the corporate sector\u2019s behavior\nin favor of greater environmental sustainability. A central argument in the\ntransnationalist research agenda is that environmental NGOs play a crucial role\nin creating global environmental awareness, spreading ecological values across\nborders, and targeting private actors in their campaigning efforts. In the era of\nglobalization, which provides the \u201cinfrastructure\u201d in the form of global com-\nmunication systems, for new forms of \u201cworld civic politics\u201d26 private governance\nthus emerges not in a political vacuum but in an increasingly politicized space\nof transnational interaction.\nAgainst the backdrop of this transnationalist conception of global politics,\nthe rise of private governance can be seen as strengthening the position of trans-\nnational activist groups in global environmental politics. In this view, impor-\ntant connections exist between the self-regulating activities of corporations and\ncampaigns organized by environmental and consumer groups around the\nworld. The argument is that corporate self-regulation re\u00baects not so much a\ndesire by corporations to govern themselves but a need to respond to public\npressure. The campaigning efforts of NGOs are an essential factor in the prolif-\neration of PEG; they push and shove corporations in the direction of environ-\nmental sustainability. At the same time, private governance helps empower\nglobal civil society in providing activist groups with political levers that exist\noutside the states-system.27\nThere is indeed growing empirical evidence that NGOs play an important\nrole in the formation of PEG, contributing in two principal ways. First, NGOs\ntarget individual \u00aarms that they accuse of environmentally damaging behavior,\nwith a view to changing that behavior and creating conditions in which other\n\u00aarms are induced to comply with higher environmental standards. An example\nof this kind of activity is Greenpeace\u2019s campaign against the sinking of Shell\u2019s\nBrent Spar oil platform in the North Sea, which forced the company to abandon\nits original plan for decommissioning and opt for the more costly alternative of\ndismantling on land. The repercussions of this were felt well beyond the indi-\nvidual case. Greenpeace succeeded in creating suf\u00aacient public awareness of the\npotential ecological risks of deep sea decommissioning that other \u00aarms have\nhad to adjust their own decommissioning plans and explore alternative op-\ntions. By attacking a single \u00aarm, Greenpeace succeeded in establishing a quasi-\nstandard for decommissioning of oil platforms.28\nSecond, NGOs also target entire business sectors, seeking to engage them\nin a process of establishing sector-speci\u00aac environmental standards. In this case,\nNGOs are both a stimulus for and a participant in PEG, and may also play a key\nRobert Falkner \u2022 79\n26. Wapner 1996.\n27. On the role of NGOs in creating private environmental governance, see Newell 2001; and\nBendell 2000.\n28. This quasi-standard was undermined by Greenpeace\u2019s later admission that errors occurred\nwhen it calculated the potential risk to marine life from the sea-based decommissioning of\nBrent Spar.\nrole in monitoring compliance. An important example is the global regime to\nprotect forests that has emerged outside the conventional, state-centric realm of\nenvironmental regulation. The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was launched\nin 1993 by the World Wide Fund for Nature in response to a lack of effective ac-\ntion by the international community. It establishes criteria for sustainable forest\nmanagement, certifying companies complying with FSC standards.29\nThe growing involvement of civil society actors in private governance\nsigni\u00aaes an interesting point of departure in the study of global governance.\nSome analysts contend that NGOs are empowered by their ability to target\nglobal \u00aarms in transnational campaigns without having to rely on the estab-\nlished channels of international policy-making.30 According to this view, envi-\nronmental activism directed at the corporate sector has opened up new political\nspace that exists outside the con\u00aanes of the territorially-based states-system. En-\ngaging with private governance mechanisms thus provides NGOs with an alter-\nnative form of global environmental activism that is potentially more effective\nthan lobbying states to establish international environmental regulation.\nTargeting individual corporations or industry sectors and engaging with\n\u00aarms in a process of global standard setting has become an important form of\nenvironmental activism for many NGOs. Yet this trend raises important ques-\ntions about the nature of the relationship between private actors and activist\ngroups. Some activists have voiced concern about the closeness of this relation-\nship fearing that NGOs are in danger of losing their original identity as civil\nsociety actors with campaigns driven by ecological values.\nIndeed, these concerns point to critical issues in the conceptualization of\nthe link between private governance and global civil society. First, where envi-\nronmental NGOs provide the impetus for the creation of private governance,\nthey often do so in an unsystematic, uneven manner, concentrating on those en-\nvironmental issues that are more likely to support media-intensive public cam-\npaigns, as is the case with Greenpeace. It is often large corporations operating at\nthe consumer end of the production chain that are most vulnerable to con-\nsumer boycotts and campaigns that dent their reputation. Recent examples of\nsuccessful campaigns against such \u00aarms include the sporting goods manufac-\nturer Nike and the oil company Shell. Given the selective and uneven focus of\nNGO campaigns, it therefore falls upon public regulatory authorities to ensure\nadequate global governance. World civic action alone cannot guarantee compre-\nhensive coverage.31\nSecond, the growing willingness of environmental NGOs to engage in a\nconstructive dialogue with corporations and participate in efforts to establish\nprivate governance mechanisms has created a new form of interdependence that\nmay limit the scope for independent civil society activism. One aspect of this\n80 \u2022 Private Environmental Governance and International Relations\n29. See Humphreys 1996 and also in this volume.\n30. Wapner 1997.\n31. See similar concerns raised in Newell 2001.\nnew interdependence between the private sector and civil society is the growing\nreliance on corporate funding by some environmental NGOs. Another aspect is\nthe concern that, by working with corporations to create global environmental\nstandards, NGOs are effectively lending legitimacy to these corporations and\ntheir business operations. Rather than empowering NGOs, private governance\ncan thus be seen as taming civil society actors.\nThere is undoubtedly an important link between private governance and\nglobal civil society that warrants a transnationalist perspective on the changing\nconditions of global environmental politics. But to presume that the rise of pri-\nvate governance works in one direction, empowering environmental activists\nand enhancing the potential for more effective environmental governance,\nwould be misleading. The study of transnationalism needs to be grounded in a\npolitical-economic perspective that critically examines the power relationship\nbetween private actors and environmental NGOs.\nShift in Authority, Shift in Ideology?\nThe third, related, dimension of PEG is that it is held to signify a shift not only\nin authority but also in ideology. In this view, the growing reliance on private\ngovernance in global environmental management represents a privileging of a\nbusiness-friendly, market-oriented approach to environmental politics over a\nmore holistic and ecology-oriented understanding of the relationship between\nhuman activity and environmental destruction. The \u201cprivatization\u201d of global\nenvironmental politics is regarded as a process that undermines established,\nstate-centric, models of democratic accountability in global governance and\npromotes a deregulatory agenda serving to weaken the transformative power of\nglobal environmentalism.32\nUnderlying the trend towards PEG is a change in attitude and strategy in\nthe corporate sector over the last twenty years.33 In the 1970s and early 1980s,\ncorporate responses to the environmental agenda were largely hostile and con-\nsisted of little more than reluctant adaptation. While many companies continue\nto react in similar fashion, the 1980s saw the emergence of new responses based\non proactive and systematic integration of environmental goals into corporate\nstrategy. Having failed to stem the tide of environmental regulation and facing\nchanging consumer attitudes, many corporations began to develop systematic\nenvironmental management strategies. Drawing on managerial approaches as-\nsociated with ecological modernization,34 corporate leaders embraced the no-\ntion that corporate environmentalism can promote \u201cwin-win solutions\u201d that\nfurther business and environmental interests.35 A practical manifestation of this\nRobert Falkner \u2022 81\n32. Stevis and Assetto 2001.\n33. On the change in corporate attitudes, see Fisher and Schot 1993; and Piasecki 1995.\n34. On ecological modernization, see Weale 1992.\n35. Porter and van der Linde 1995.\nwas corporations becoming more actively involved in the international political\nprocess, seeking not simply to block environmental initiatives but to shape and\nin\u00bauence them.\nCorporate efforts to shape the global environmental agenda were particu-\nlarly visible in the run-up to the Rio Earth Summit of 1992. Individual \u00aarms\nand organizations such as the Business Council on Sustainable Development\n(BCSD) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) lobbied delegates\nand promoted the idea of a partnership between the private sector, environmen-\ntalists and international society in searching for environmental solutions.\nPutting forward an interpretation of sustainable development that sought to\nreconcile environmental and business concerns, BCSD and ICC in a sense pro-\nvided a blueprint for a more market-oriented and self-regulatory model of\nglobal environmental governance.36\nThe ideas informing business interpretations of sustainable development\ncenter on the notion that markets, if left to their own devices, have the ability to\nregulate themselves. Environmental governance emerges as a natural outcome\nof the market process and only in extreme scenarios requires intervention by\nstates to impose regulatory regimes. Under normal circumstances, producers\nwill incorporate environmental concerns into their activities wherever consum-\ners value environmental sustainability, allowing for the price mechanism to\nestablish the optimal level of investment in environmental protection efforts.\nThese ideas have entered the praxis of PEG in a number of ways. The ISO\n14000 series represents the most systematic effort to date to lay down principles\nof environmental self-regulation. They are based on the notion that corpora-\ntions can agree to a set of principles and guidelines that govern their environ-\nmental management without needing external, state-sponsored, enforcement\nmechanisms. In the area of climate change, where the international negotiation\nprocess has been predicated on the need for setting emission reduction targets,\nglobal \u00aarms have successfully lobbied governments to include more \u00baexible im-\nplementation mechanisms involving emissions trading systems currently being\nset up by business organizations.\nCritics, however, argue that this business interpretation of sustainable\ndevelopment and environmental governance puts at risk the environmental\nmovement\u2019s achievement in establishing a political agenda for international en-\nvironmental issues. By linking environmental policies with the self-regulatory\neconomic agenda, private actors are seen to promote a managerial perspective\non global environmental issues that precludes a more radical critique of the\nworld economy as a source of the ecological crisis. In this view, the emergence\nof PEG represents a shift in the ideological underpinnings of environmental\npolitics towards a corporate conception of state-market relations.37\nCriticisms of this kind certainly provoke many questions and provide a\nuseful corrective to the belief in the self-healing capacity of global markets. They\n82 \u2022 Private Environmental Governance and International Relations\n36. See Schmidheiny 1992; and Eden 1994.\n37. The Ecologist 1993; and Chatterjee and Finger 1994.\ngive rise to an important research agenda that sees private actors as part of a\nwider global framework of domination based on a mix of economic might and\nideological predominance. Neo-Gramscian approaches in IPE, for example, em-\nploy the notion of a global hegemonic order, comprising elites from MNCs,\nstate agencies, civil society and academia, which legitimizes a speci\u00aac model of\nglobal political-economic organization and marginalizes alternative political\nideologies. Private governance appears to \u00aat well into the neo-Gramscian argu-\nment that global hegemony is never a \u00aaxed entity, but is constantly undergoing\na process of contestation and re-alignment of its central forces. In this view, the\ngrowing relevance of private forms of environmental governance suggests a con-\nvergence of global hegemonic forces towards a model of environmental gover-\nnance that favors \u201cmarket-enabling regimes\u201d over \u201cregulatory regimes.\u201d38\nYet, the view that the rise of PEG represents an ideological shift in global\nenvironmental politics raises two critical problems; it is in danger of overstating\nthe in\u00bauence of business in setting the global agenda and understating the con-\ntinuity of a fundamentally liberal consensus enshrined in the global environ-\nmental agenda. With regard to the role of \u00aarms, it is fair to say that private actors\nhave certainly adopted a more proactive role in global environmental politics\nand are powerful lobbyists in the international bargaining process. But corpo-\nrate involvement continues to vary considerably, across different sectors and\ntypes of business organizations, and is far from promoting an ideologically con-\nsistent agenda. As the international politics of ozone, climate and biodiversity\ndemonstrate, business con\u00baict over the objectives and design of global environ-\nmental regulations continues to weaken the business case in environmental\npolitics.39 At the same time, corporations often pursue contradictory objectives\nwhen seeking to in\u00bauence global environmental governance. Global \u00aarms may\nwish to achieve harmonization of environmental standards while national\n\u00aarms continue to oppose them; and although favoring market-consistent regu-\nlation in principle, many \u00aarms that have successfully adapted to command-and-\ncontrol regulations often \u00aand it in their economic interest to preserve such tra-\nditional, state-centric, forms of governance.\nMoreover, the notion that we are experiencing an ideological shift in envi-\nronmental politics tends to understate the continuity of a liberal orientation\nin global environmental governance. The rise of private governance has un-\ndoubtedly strengthened the place of liberal ideas of self-regulation in environ-\nmental politics, particularly since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. But to suggest\nthat this represents fundamental change in the ideological underpinnings of\nglobal governance underestimates the extent to which the institutionalized\npraxis of environmental protection has come to re\u00baect liberal political and eco-\nnomic ideas. As Bernstein has recently argued, the emergence of the \u201ccompro-\nmise of liberal environmental ism\u201d40 over the last thirty years is less the result of\ncorporate efforts than of a convergence of policy ideas among leading members\nRobert Falkner \u2022 83\n38. Levy and Egan 1990.\n39. Falkner 2001.\n40. Bernstein 2001.\nof state-sponsored policy networks, such as the OECD. He argues that \u201cindustry\ncannot be credited with formulating ideas around sustainable development or\nwith being overly signi\u00aacant players in its institutionalisation.\u201d41 It is therefore\nmore appropriate to view PEG as strengthening the existing dominance of a lib-\neral environmentalist philosophy in international politics, than as being a\ncausal factor in itself. If an ideological shift can be detected at all, then it is oc-\ncurring within the liberal paradigm of global environmentalism, away from the\nfree-market ideal towards that of markets governed by large \u00aarms. As economic\nliberals point out,42 global standard-setting by large corporations is at risk of\ndistorting free markets and discriminating against weaker competitors, thus fa-\nvoring the interests of big business and undermining the classic liberal ideal of\nfair play in economic competition.\nConclusion\nPrivate governance has become a reality in global environmental politics that\nfew analysts deny. Its signi\u00aacance for International Relations, however, remains\ncontested in contemporary debates about globalization and international order.\nThere are good reasons to suggest that the rise of private actors in environmen-\ntal governance points to an ongoing erosion of state capacity, empowerment of\nglobal civil society and shift in the ideological underpinnings of global environ-\nmental governance.\nHowever, closer analysis of the phenomenon of private governance reveals\nthe more complex connections that exist between the \u201cprivatization\u201d of envi-\nronmental governance and shifts in the relationship between \u00aarms, states and\nglobal civil society. The new agenda in global governance is de\u00aaned by an intri-\ncate private-public nexus in which private and public authorities work hand-in-\nhand to rede\u00aane the parameters of global policy-making. Environmental activ-\nists\u2019 groups assume a larger role in shaping global agendas and pressuring pri-\nvate actors into action, but their involvement in private governance also serves\nto alter their role and identity as nonstate actors. And PEG not only strengthens\nthe predominant liberal paradigm in the ideational structure contained in the\nglobal environmental agenda, but promotes a model of global self-regulation\nthat bene\u00aats the interests of powerful MNCs.\nThis raises a number of issues that ought to be central to future research\non PEG in international relations. First, if the ongoing spread of private gover-\nnance mechanisms does not suggest a straightforward power shift away from\nstates and towards \u00aarms but a more complex interdependence between private\nand public actors, then the public-private mix in environmental governance\nneeds to move center-stage in the study of international environmental politics.\nSecond, given the close involvement of NGOs in private governance, we need to\n84 \u2022 Private Environmental Governance and International Relations\n41. Bernstein 2001, 15.\n42. See Henderson 2001.\nlook more carefully at the ways in which global civil society actors are co-opted\ninto self-regulatory efforts, and how this changes their role and in\u00bauence in the\nglobal environmental agenda. Third, if private governance tends to promote a\nparticular international liberal consensus in environmental governance that\nstrengthens the position of MNCs, then we need to pay closer attention to ongo-\ning processes of rede\u00aaning the legitimacy of public and private actors in global\nenvironmental governance.\nReferences\nBail, Christoph, Robert Falkner, and Helen Marquard, eds. 2002.
