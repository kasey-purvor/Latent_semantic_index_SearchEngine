The Project also provided opportunities for the discussion of the history \nof cultural programs amongst a variety academics and arts administrators; I found participation in this \ndebate both stimulating and useful. \n 2 \nIntroduction \nIt has become increasingly familiar to explain the contemporary arrangements for the management of \nculture in terms of culture\u201fs \u201eprivatization\u201f. This characterisation describes a trend identifiable across \nall those governmental sectors\u2014health, education, and social security\u2014established (in their \nnationalised form) as part of the post-world war two welfare state. As there has been a (relative) \nwithdrawal of government from these sectors, so too has the notion that government has a role to play \nin relation to the subvention of culture increasingly come into question. This shift in governmentality \nproduces a range of problems, for instance, access to diverse cultural resources, cultural pluralism, \nfunding for non-profitable \u201eresearch and development\u201f in the cultural sector; I have discussed these \nproblems elsewhere.\n2\n It is not the function of this paper to revisit or discuss further the issues at stake in \nthis shift in governmentality which has produced a new range of cultural technologies for the \nmanagement of the population. Rather, via the discussion of a selection of art programs from the 1930s \nI want to offer a particular theoretical framework for the analysis of conjunctions of culture and \ngovernment.  \n \nIt is possible to provide a distinctive perspective on the history of culture and government by arguing \nthat the relations between culture and government are best defined by the ways in which different \nstrategies for the management of populations have been organised and deployed. These relations have \nbeen various but above all can be understood by the ways in which government has strategically used \nart to act on \u201ethe social\u201f. This analysis seeks to describe the intersection of the different organising \nprinciples which inform the conjunctions of art, citizenship and government. This description will \nemphasise the complex and contradictory nature of rationales for arts administration. In other words, I \nfind no single defining logic to explain the particular forms of art\u201fs governmentalisation in the thirties.  \n                                                          \n2\n I have discussed this shift as it has occurred in Australia in \u201eThe Arts as Industry\u201f 1999. \n 3 \n \nI want to establish immediately that my conception of government is not limited to organisations or \nmechanisms attached to the state. Rather, analysis of the relations between art and citizenship is \ninformed by an understanding of governmental power drawn from a particular reading of Michel \nFoucault\u201fs concept of \u201egovernmentality\u201f (Foucault, 1991). In brief there are three aspects of this \nconcept which are useful for this inquiry. The first is the notion that not all forms of political power \nhave their origins in the state; rather, government refers to the activities of all institutions concerned \nwith the regulation and management of populations. Second, is the precept that government is not \nunified in its function. Governmental rationales and technologies are distinctive and have distinct \nhistories. Third, is the notion that the object of government is population, and that to this object is \nbrought an amalgam of techniques with particular objectives which are practical. In relation to this, \nFoucault suggests that government is intrinsically involved with moulding both public and private \nbehaviour, or, to put it another way, government is concerned with the \u201econduct of conduct\u201f.  \n \nThe period of the 1930s and 1940s is especially significant for the ways in which arts funding came to \nbe institutionalised in the post-war Anglophone world. During the 1930s and 1940s the arts were \nadministered by an increasingly diverse range of organisations. This had two direct outcomes. The first \noutcome was that there was an increased political expectation that it was a responsibility of the state to \nfund and administer art. This meant that in a time of dire economic and political circumstance, due first \nto the Depression and then to WWII, there were multiple initiatives for administering the arts with the \naim of extending access and participation. In the second place, linked to this shift in arts management, \nthere was a shift in the way \u201ethe people\u201f were constructed in relation to art. Far from art being thought \nof as the property of the few or the elite, the definitive art programs of the 1930s and early 1940s were \ntitled \u201eArt for the People\u201f and proudly proclaimed that art was the property of \u201eEveryman\u201f. Both of \n 4 \nthese discursive shifts were the outcome of much longer histories. Specifically, they can be seen in \nrelation to the more general movement towards different strategies for the management of \u201ethe social\u201f, \nwhich can be traced from the early nineteenth century in, for example, museum policy.  \n \nThe 1930s and 1940s are significant for the ways in which cultural policy sought to act on the citizen \nfrom a distance. These strategies hoped to produce and encourage citizens capable of self-regulation in \na way that would ensure their active and productive contribution to the nation. Thus, artists in America \nwere encouraged to paint \u201eAmerican\u201f, British culture became a symbol of \u201ewhat we are fighting for\u201f, \nand, in the latter half of the 1940s, cultural programs were a significant part of the Australian \nreconstruction. In each of these instances the promise of cultural access was part of the promise of a \nnew reconstructed nation. Above all these programs can be understood as being characterised by a \nparticular governmental rationality. This \u201ewelfarist\u201f rationality constructed the citizenry as consisting of \nfree individuals responsible for their own self-management. The cultural technologies of the 1930s and \n1940s constructed the citizenry as freely participating members of a democracy to be protected and \nsaved from the fascist threat. Characteristic of the 1930s was a contradictory concern with the \n\u201egovernment culture\u201f of fascism on the one hand and an increasingly dominant perception that \nsubvention of cultural production was a state responsibility. Thus, art programs managed by the state \nwere characteristically part of the governmental tendencies of social-welfarism. As a result of the \ncompeting logics characteristic of the welfarist governmental rationality, cultural and social \ntechnologies of the 1930s and 1940s sought to manage the citizen from \u201earm\u201fs length\u201f. Art programs \nwere one of the ways in which the citizenry was educated to manage itself in relation to a certain set of \ndesirable norms. During the 1930s in America these norms were set in relation to the construction of a \nfree citizen who had the capacities to participate in the reconstructed democratic New Deal America. \nWe will have an opportunity to interrogate the terms of these constructions later, for now I want to state \n 5 \nthat there is no single logic through which we can understand this formation of culture and government. \nTo describe the relations between art, citizenship, and government as a formation is to recognise the \ncharacteristic and defining features of this conjunction but it is also to recognise the nature of this \nformation as constituting a field in which a number of changing elements are in constant competition.  \n \nFederal Art Project \nAs the most well known of the 1930s art projects and as the only art project which was specifically a \ncreation of the New Deal, it is fitting to begin our discussion with the Federal Art Project (FAP). In \n1935 the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act was passed by Congress, this Act gave government \nbroad powers to centralise the administration of and provide funds for the problem of unemployment \nrelief. To administer this problem the Federal Works Agency was inaugurated in 1935 and was made \nup of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and other administration units. Within the WPA in the \nDivision of Professional and Service Projects a section was established titled Federal Project Number \nOne. Federal One, as it was called, was made up of the FAP, the Federal Theatre Project, the Federal \nMusic Project, the Federal Writers Project, and the Historical Records Survey. \n \nThere are two primary reasons why government organised and funded the large art projects of the New \nDeal. In the first instance, the FAP received appropriations from Congress primarily as a work relief \nproject designed to create employment for unemployed artists. We must underscore the novelty of this \nidea involving as it did \u201ea radical revision of the traditional conception, for it implied that it was normal \nfor artists to be hired for fees or wages\u2026\u201f (Rosenburg, 1975, p. 197). Nevertheless, at its peak the FAP \nemployed more than 5,000 artists. The second primary reason for government attention to the arts in the \nmidst of the Depression was because the FAP was also understood as having a wider social function. In \nparticular art created by FAP programs was characterised as \u201eart for the people\u201f, this was art that spoke \n 6 \nto and depicted the life of the \u201epeople\u201f understood as citizens participating in the reconstruction of the \nnation. The art projects operated as a mechanism through which the New Deal citizen was to be \neducated and equipped with a variety of capacities. For instance, the citizen was to be educated as a \ndiscerning consumer. This citizen-consumer would be equipped not only with the attributes to \nparticipate in the workings of the new reconstructed American nation through the exercise of her or his \nsocial and political responsibilities but also through the thrifty expenditure of her or his capital and the \nsensible expenditure of her or his leisure time. Director of the FAP, Holger Cahill, explained how the \nFAP might contribute to the education of good consumption practices when he wrote that \u201eWe are not \nparticularly interested in developing what is known as art appreciation. We are interested in raising a \ngeneration sensitive to their visual environment and capable of helping to improve it\u201f (in McKinzie \n1973, p. 130). Thus, the FAP was typical of the New Deal in that it operated not only according to the \nimmediate aim of aid to artists but also with a greater social goal in mind.  \n \nCahill made a broader statement of the FAP\u201fs various social aims in a FAP operating manual written in \n1935: \nThe plan of the FAP provides for the employment of artists in varied enterprises. \nThrough employment of creative artists it is hoped, through art teaching and recreational \nactivities to create a broader national art consciousness and work out constructive ways \nof using leisure time, through services in applied art to aid various campaigns of social \nvalue. The aim of the project will be to work toward an integration of the arts with the \ndaily life of the community, and an integration of the fine arts and practical arts. (in \nO\u201fConnor 1969, p. 28) \n \n 7 \nThere are three linked aims in this statement: art programs would encourage a more artistically aware \npopulation who would expend their leisure time in constructive ways; applied art would be utilised in \ncampaigns advocating particular social values (such as, murals in hospitals, schools, public art in \ngovernment housing spaces and so forth); and through these types of programs, the FAP would \nengender a bonding of applied and fine art. These aims would result in the production and consumption \nof better design, and more widely accessible (both physically and intellectually) cultural production; in \na phrase the Project would produce and advocate \u201euseful culture\u201f. The FAP, far from being simply a \nwork relief programme for artists, was primarily understood as a programme which could provide an \neducation in the civic capacities which would be required under the more collectively aligned New Deal \nstate.  \n \nThe community art centre programme most clearly reflected the FAP\u201fs more instrumental goals in \nrelation to the education of citizenship.\n3\n While the community art centre was part of a relatively small \nsection of the FAP the rationales framing the programme are illustrative of the larger project. The \ncommunity art centres, along with the FAP mural program, were the public faces of the project. \nAccording to historian Page Smith, by 1940 an estimated eight million people had attended the one \nhundred art centres established by the FAP (1987, p. 810). \n                                                          \n3\n However, we must bear in mind that the educational services section, of which the community art \ncentres were a part, made up only 17% of the FAP. The project consisted of the following sections: \n48% fine art (murals, sculpture, easel painting, graphic arts), 29% practical and applied arts (posters, \nphotography, Index of American Design, arts and craft, models), 17% educational services (federal art \ngalleries, community art centres, art teaching, research and information), 6% technical and supervisory \n(Berman 1977, p.xvii-viii). McDonald states that by 1939 the education section had grown to 25% of \nthe project (1969, p. 422-23). \n 8 \n \nThe community centres were based on two main aims. The first was to provide democratic access to \nculture, thus, Assistant Director of the FAP, Thomas Parker, said that the centres were devoted \u201eto \nreturning art to the people, to all the people\u201f (in McKinzie 1973, p. 141). In the second place the centres \nwere a site for the management and reconstruction of citizens who for various reasons were disaffected, \ndisconnected and\/or defined as dysfunctional. In this sense then art was used as social therapy. Irving \nMarantz, an FAP artist teacher, put the utility of art in this way when he commented that art was \u201ea \ngreat therapy\u201f which could turn juveniles (and by implication other misfits) \u201einto useful social beings\u201f \n(1973, p. 198). Thus, the Community Art Centre Programme targeted areas which were considered \n\u201eculturally needy\u201f- rural and desert areas, deprived urban communities and new housing developments. \nA project statement put the importance of the Community Art Centres in this way the \ndraining of America\u201fs best talent from the native soil of the small town to the strange \npavements of the big city, has inundated certain sections of America and left others high \nand dry as potential cultural wastelands. It seems essential for the best interests of \nAmerican cultural life that this process now be reversed. The provinces of America may \nyet become as important to the cultural life of America as the provinces of France and \nGermany are to their respective cultures. (in White 1987, p. 2) \nThus, areas and communities defined as peripheral to the nation were reconstructed in Project discourse \nas essential to the cultural development of the national whole. \n \nPerhaps one of the most distinctive aspects of the community art centres and the aspect that most \ndistinguishes the form of cultural consumption promoted in the 1930s is the emphasis on participation \nin the production process rather than the finished product. Across the limited literature available on the \ncommunity art centres there are assertions from both project bureaucrats and artist teachers of the \n 9 \nnecessity of active participation by people attending the art centres. The artists\u201f statement presented at \nthe opening of Chicago\u201fs South Side Community Art Centre is illustrative in this respect. \nAs teachers, some of us were able to unearth, encourage and develop dormant talents of \nmany. As artists ourselves, creatively, we were able to experiment and work in many \ntechniques and processes which were denied to us before because we would not afford to \npay to go to art schools or because we were discriminated against as Negroes. We feel \nthat with this art centre, a worthwhile contribution is being made to all the peoples of the \ncommunity. This art centre is an opportunity for self-expression and development for all \npeople. We truly feel that art belongs to all of the people and should be enjoyed by all. \n(in Burroughs 1987, p. 138) \n \nThis statement is not singular, there are similar statements in relation to the Harlem, LeMoyne and \nJacksonville Negro Community Art Centres for instance. These statements characteristically attribute \nthe Community Art Centre programme and the FAP with providing both the space and opportunity for \nblack artists to bring their work to black communities. What is striking about these statements is the \nway in which art centres are seen as addressing an endemic discrimination against black artists at the \nsame time as providing a space for cultural production which is for \u201eall the people\u201f, not just the black \ncommunities in which the centres were situated.\n4\n In this way in Community Art Centre discourse the \nblack artist figured as an artist-citizen who could contribute directly to the reconstruction of the nation \nby encouraging the development of a particular kind of institutionally based participatory cultural \nprocess. The facilitation of this participatory cultural process by the art centre and the artist-citizen \nwould retrieve communities from their occupation of the periphery to participate in the reconstruction \n                                                          \n4\n Most community art centres either closed or became devoted to war efforts after the United State\u201fs \nentry into WWII. \n 10 \nof a New Deal America. Despite the obvious point that black communities were not able to participate \npolitically in the reconstruction of the nation, community art centre discourse emphasised the \nparticipatory and democratic nature of cultural production and consumption. Thus, art centres in Negro \ncommunities were constructed as both community based and as contributing to a holistic understanding \nof a reconstructed American culture characterised above all by a participatory democracy. In this way \ncommunity art centres placed in communities which were seen as peripheral were designed to \nreconnect such communities with the national whole.     \n \nThese art centres were popular in their appeal and quote impressive attendance figures, for instance, the \nHarlem Community Art Centre had over 70,000 attendees in its first sixteenth months (Bennett 1973, p. \n214), the Jacksonville, Florida Community Art Centre had 40,000 attendees in the three years of its \noperation (Sutton 1973, p.216). It is not persuasive to dismiss the popularity of such centres as \u201efalse \nconsciousness\u201f or to describe the workings of the centres and the New Deal in general in terms of a \nstate based cultural hegemony\n5\n. Such explanations do little to explain a variety of points relating to the \noperation of the programme as a separate New Deal art programme or the specific workings of \nindividual centres. For instance, the ratio of art centres continued to increase after the withdrawal of \nfederal administration due to the shift against the New Deal from 1937 onwards. Or how do we account \nfor the fate of those centres, for instance the Harlem Community Art Centre, which were closed as a \nresult of investigations by the House of Un-American Activities Committee.\n6\n Analyses attributing a \nsingle state based ideological logic to the working of cultural programs cannot account for the specific \nand concrete workings and effects of such programs. This is not to deny that there are particular power \n                                                          \n5\n See for instance Jonathan Harris\u201fs (1995) otherwise interesting history of the FAP. \n6\n Thanks to Joan Saab for this information. \n 11 \neffects but it is to recognise that such effects, intended or otherwise, are always the result of a process \nof negotiation between competing interests and discourses in the sites of their application. \n \nSection of Painting and Sculpture \nThe other main art project of the 1930s was the Section of Painting and Sculpture established in 1934 \nand in operation until 1943. The Section, which received its funds directly from Treasury, \ncommissioned work for the embellishment of Federal buildings. The Section was not a work relief \nproject, selection for commissions was on the basis of quality and the requirements were quite specific. \nThe members of the Section advisory committee were proponents of realist art depicting the \u201eAmerican \nscene\u201f and were antagonistic to European modernist art. \u201ePainting Section\u201f, as Thomas Hart Benton \ndisparagingly described it, involved a realist style which depicted \u201ethe people\u201f as heroic in their daily \nactivities.\n7\n Thus Section art presented images of \u201ethe people\u201f practising civic responsibility in their \nwork and social occupations.  \n \nWhile it was important that Section artists celebrated the \u201eAmerican Way of Life\u201f in their \ncommissioned works, this art also had to be representative of the best of American talent. The primary \ngoal of the Section, as stated in its first Bulletin in 1935, was to \u201esecure suitable art of the best quality \nfor the embellishment of public buildings\u201f (in O\u201fConnor 1969, p. 21). Edward Bruce, the Director of \nthe Section, put the aim this way:  \n                                                          \n7\n In a similar sense history painting was the favoured style of the early days of the French Revolution, \ninvolving depiction of the classical virtues, it was argued history painting could best communicate and \nglorify a particular range of civic virtues. (see Crow, 1985)  \n 12 \nOur objective should be to enrich the lives of all our people by making things of the \nspirit, the creation of beauty part of their daily lives, by giving them new hopes and \nsources of interest to fill their leisure, by eradicating the mere utility, and by fostering all \nthe simple pleasures of life which are not important in terms of dollars spent but are \nimmensely important in terms of a higher standard of living. (in Park and Markowitz \n1992, p. 132) \nThe envisaged outcome of the Section art project was not only the education of the \u201eeveryman\u201f in the \ncivic virtues but also the training of \u201egood\u201f citizenship was indivisible from a training in \u201egood\u201f \nconsumption. This emphasis had two main configurations; first, there was an interest in an education \nfor the proper use of leisure time; second, there was an emphasis on training the people to recognise, \nproduce and purchase good quality design.  \n \nThis insertion of quality art into the daily lives of the people was to be achieved by the nation-wide \ndistribution of art in small federal buildings, such as post offices. During the nine years of the Section\u201fs \nexistence it commissioned murals and sculpture for federal buildings and eleven hundred new post \noffices across America (Park and Markowitz 1992, p. 136-7). A Section Bulletin described the post \noffice as \u201ethe one concrete link between every community of individuals and the Federal government\u201f \nthat functioned \u201eimportantly in the human structure of the community\u201f (in Park and Markowitz 1984, p. \n8). The distribution of art in this way was instrumental in terms of the establishment of a visual \nconnection between art, government, and the people. The murals in small federal buildings interpreted \nthis relation and depicted it as a celebration of nation and citizenship. These national representations \nwere at the same time local and regional as the Section required that artists work extensively with the \nlocal community. In this way the Section could claim that the commissioning process and its outcome \nwas one of collaboration between community, artist and government. Thus Section art articulated both \n 13 \nthe particular identity of the community and at the same time connected this specific identity into the \ngreater whole of the reconstructed America.  \n \nKaral Ann Marling\u201fs history of post-office murals discusses the extent to which the collaborative \nprocess advocated by the Section can be taken as reflecting the reality of the commissioning process \n(1982). Marling finds that the commissioning process was different in each town depending on the \neffort to which the artist went in seeking community feedback and the extent to which the community \nwanted to be involved. However, it is clear from Marling\u201fs study that while Section rhetoric \nencouraged community consultation, the administrative organisation of the Section did not facilitate \nsuch consultation. Nevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to understand the workings of the Section \nsimply as involving the installation of works which the community passively accepted. Both Marling \nand Park and Markowitz, in another study of post-office murals, discuss various instances where works \nwhich the community did not like, were either not installed or quickly taken down (Marling 1982, p.14 \nand Park and Markowitz 1984, p. 8). The process for commissioning, production and installation of \nsuch works was based on the precept of community consultation. Analysis of the concrete \ncircumstances of the commissioning and installation processes of the Section is enlightening in relation \nto the negotiated nature of the outcomes of cultural programs under the New Deal.\n8\n \n \nThe America Artist\u2019s Congress \nThe connection between art, government and the people was articulated distinctively by the Artist\u201fs \nUnion of America and the American Artist\u201fs Congress. Both of these organisations, while organised \n                                                          \n8\n See for a history of the Section Park and Markowitz 1984 and for discussion of the reception of \nparticular murals commissioned by the Section Beckham 1989 and Marling 1982. \n 14 \naround different primary aims acted to professionalise the construction of the artist. Both the Union and \nthe Congress presented the figure of the artist as a professional \u201ecultural worker\u201f whose work was \nintegrally tied to the achievement and maintenance of a popular democracy. In this way the Union and \nthe Congress claimed that funding of the arts was a responsibility of the state. Stuart Davis of the \nAmerican Artists\u201f Congress encapsulated the essence of this position when he advocated state arts \nsubvention in the interest of preserving popular and democratic access to the arts: \nSuch conservation can continue only with the support of a government administration \nthat will regard the arts, along with proper housing, playgrounds, health service, social \nsecurity legislation, and educational facilities for all, as part of the basic obligations of a \ndemocratic government of all people towards the welfare of its citizens. (1973, p. 250) \nBoth the Artists\u201f Union and the Congress trace their lineage to the John Reed Club. The John Reed \nClub was a radical cultural organisation established in 1929 in New York.\n9\n At its meetings, lectures and \nart school the club taught that artist\u201fs interests were in harmony with those of the working classes and \nthus art should advance the position of the working classes. The American Artist\u201fs Congress was begun \nat a Reed Club meeting in 1935, the same year the Reed Clubs were officially disbanded. Unlike the \nReed Clubs the Congress was not specifically attached to the Communist Party, nevertheless, the \nCongress continued to be informed by the Reed Club\u201fs \u201eProlecult\u201f understanding of \u201eart as a social \nforce\u201f.10 However, for the Congress the artist was a cultural worker contributing towards the \nestablishment of a popular democratic culture rather than the stimulation of a revolutionary working \nclass.  \n \n                                                          \n9\n By 1933 the organisation had 200 members in New York (Monroe 1971, p. 34-36). \n10\n The John Reed Club was a member of the International Union of Revolutionary Writers and thus \nreceived its policy directives direct from the Stalin regime (Harrison, p. 243). \n 15 \nThe Congress was established as part of the Popular Front policy of a united alliance against fascism. \nLike the Popular Front generally the Congress was supportive of New Deal programs and reforms. In \nthe Congress we can observe an organisation dedicated to the opposition of fascism but at the same \ntime advocating state support of the arts in the interests of popular democracy. The preamble to the first \nArtist\u201fs Congress, held in 1936, stated the reasons for its formation: \n1. to unite artists of all aesthetic tendencies to enable them to attain their common \ncultural objectives; \n2. to establish closer relationships between the artist and the people and extend the \ninfluence of art as a force of enlightenment; \n3. to advocate and uphold permanent Governmental support for the advancement of \nAmerican art; \n4. to support other organised groups on issues of mutual interest in an effort to develop \nand maintain conditions favourable to art and human existence; \n5. to oppose all reactionary attempts to curtail democratic rights and freedom of \nexpression and all tendencies that lead to Fascism; \n6. to oppose war and prevent the establishment of conditions that are conducive to the \ndestruction of culture and detrimental to the progress of mankind. (in Baigell and \nWilliams 1986 [1936], p. 11-12) \nThere are a number of interesting points in this statement of purpose, for our interests here I want to \ndraw attention to the rhetorical connection made between state support for art and the preservation of \ndemocratic culture. For artists attached to the Congress there was no contradiction implied by the \nadvocacy of state art programs on the one hand and the protection of a democratic culture against the \nthreat of fascism on the other. In the papers of the first Artist\u201fs Congress, titled Artists Against War and \nFascism, many of the papers make just this connection. For instance, A.R. Stavenitz argued that it \n 16 \n\u201eshould be obvious that the prerequisite for a healthily progressing art in this country is a permanent, \ngovernment-supported program, conceived and administered so as to make the efforts of our artists \navailable to the public, to all the people\u201f (1936\/86, p. 180). In their introduction to the collection of \nessays from this first Congress Baigell and Williams argue that \u201ethe disputes that might have arisen \nfrom such a contradiction between artists\u201f desires for free expression and the government\u201fs political \nuses of official art were to a large extent circumvented by the nature of the Popular Front itself\u201f (1986, \np. 23). Tempting as it may be to tie together the cultural interests of the Popular Front and the New \nDeal and to find evidence of an, albeit short-lived, proletarian cultural sphere I argue instead that what \nis most characteristic of the Congress is a particular rationality for the governmentalisation of culture. \nThis rationality while constructing the citizen as a freely participating member of a people\u201fs democracy \nmanages the citizen and her freedom at arm\u201fs length.  \n \nIn The Cultural Front Michael Denning argues that we can understand the relations between the \ncultural programs of the 1930s and the Popular Front as constituting a proletarian public sphere. This \nproletarian public sphere has had cultural effects beyond the 1930s according to Denning\u201fs conception \nof the \u201elaboring of American culture\u201f (1998, p. xvi-xviii). Denning discusses the distinctive nature of \nthe discursive conjunction of culture and the people across a range of institutional sites and in a range \nof cultural forms. He argues that the predominant cultural forms of the 1930s (including the New Deal \nart projects) are characteristic of the momentary dominance of a labor public sphere, a \u201ecultural front\u201f \nwhich while not successful in establishing a hegemonic formation nevertheless \u201ereshaped American \nculture\u201f (1998, p. xvi). This ambitious project is useful in its analysis of various characteristics of the \n1930s cultural formation and its relation to left and labor institutions.  \n \n 17 \nThere is not the space here to engage in an extensive analysis of Denning\u201fs arguments, for the purposes \nof this paper I want to limit myself to one main point in regards to Denning\u201fs analysis of the 1930s \ncultural front.\n11\n As a result of Denning\u201fs theoretical framework the relations between culture and the \nvarious cultural institutional sites of the 1930s are understood as constituting a left counter hegemony. \nThere are two main problems with this. First, due to Denning\u201fs use of \u201eleft\u201f and \u201eright\u201f as defining \ncategories of analysis he misses the important influence of the range of sites and discourses which can \nnot be described as \u201eleft\u201f. For instance, the characteristically social democratic nature of 1930s cultural \nprograms can be traced through the history of settlement houses and other philanthropic programs from \nthe late nineteenth century. While Denning attends to a diverse range of institutional sites and cultural \nproductions in his analysis he is limited by his attention to sites and productions which he (sometimes \nproblematically) characterises as distinctively \u201eleft\u201f. This results in the impression that there was a \nstrong left consensual \u201eflavour\u201f across the various sites of his analysis which ranges from the cultural \nprograms of the New Deal to the cultural apparatus of the cultural industries (see for instance Denning \n1998, p. 39 and p. 44). This is to overstate the extent to which we can ascribe to a diverse range of sites \nand institutions a single political logic. This is not to deny the important influence of socialist ideas for \nthe relations between culture and the people in the 1930s but it is to place limits on the extent to which \nwe can define the 1930s conjunction between art and the people as essentially left. \n \nConclusion \nThe discussion of the FAP, the Community Art Centre Programme, the Section of Painting and \nSculpture and the Artist\u201fs Congress has analysed the conjunction of art, citizenship and government \nacross different state and non-state institutions and programs. Some of the shared characteristics of \n                                                          \n11\n See for such analyses the symposium on The Popular Front in Labor History, 1998. \n 18 \nthese conjunctions have been noted, for instance, the advocacy of a participatory democracy via the \nfocus on participatory cultural processes rather than specific cultural productions. At the same time I \nhave also discussed these conjunctions in relation to the specific circumstances of their application and \nhave noted that in each case the logics of their operation were negotiated and contradictory. In the case \nof the Negro Community Art Centres for instance, the discursive construction of these centres as a site \nfor the reconnection of black communities as participating parts of a democratic and national whole \nwas clearly fiction given the contemporaneous state of black disempowerment. Nevertheless, the \nparticipatory nature of both the funding of the centres and their administration meant that the \ncommunities of which they were a part directed the programs of the individual centres. For this reason \nthe Director of the Harlem Community Art Centre, Gwendolyn Bennett, could claim that the centre was \n\u201ebecoming not only a cultural force in its particular locale, but a symbol in the culture of a race\u201f (1973, \np. 213).  \n \nIn relation to the Artist\u201fs Congress I discussed a particular conjunction of art, citizenship, and \ngovernment which was characteristic of the 1930s more generally. On the one hand, I noted that the \nidea that subvention of culture was a state responsibility was predominant. This advocacy was often \nposed in terms of the notion that an educated and culturally aware populace would be less tempted by \nfascism. On the other hand, I drew attention to the equally predominant awareness of the need to guard \nagainst the kinds of \u201egovernment culture\u201f which were characteristic of fascist countries. In this way \nthen, the characteristic relationship between art, government, and citizenship in the 1930s was an \n\u201earm\u201fs length\u201f one, which in constructing the citizen as a free, participating member of a democracy \nacted upon this \u201efree\u201f citizen in the very spaces of her or his freedom. \n \n 19 \nOne of the main functions of this paper has been to argue for a different set of terms for the analysis of \nthe relations between culture and government. I have sought to unsettle accounts of the conjunction of \nculture and government which claim that this conjunction is characterised above all by relations of \noppression or resistance, hegemony or counter-hegemony. Instead the analysis of art programs during \nthe American Depression has presented some of the benefits of analysing cultural programs which takes \naccount of the specificity of their concrete circumstances and operations. As already mentioned, this is \nfar from denying the operation of particular and definite power effects, but rather to address those \neffects in relation to the specific conditions of their making.  \n \nWe can draw lessons from the foregoing discussion of 1930s art programs for the analysis of \ncontemporary governmental arrangements. In the introduction to this paper the contemporary culture\/ \ngovernment formation was characterised in terms of culture\u201fs \u201eprivatisation\u201f. In view of the argument \nof this paper that we must attend to conjunctions of culture and government in relation to their \nspecificity I want to conclude with some remarks regarding the \u201eprivatisation\u201f of culture. Such a \ncharacterisation does not enable us to account for the ways in which state regulations still figure in \nimportant ways in culture\u201fs administration and distribution\u2014in taxation provisions, in government \ncultural subvention at the state and council levels, and in Britain and Australia, for instance, at the \ncentral government level. It may be more useful to characterise the current culture\/ government \nformation as being defined by a form of entrepreneurial governance characteristic of advanced liberal \ngovernmentality. Defining the culture\/ government formation as one of a shift in forms of governance \nrather than primarily in forms of capital ownership allows us to recognise that the new forms of conduct \ncharacteristic of entrepreneurial governance are internal to state government programs as well as non-\nstate programs. At the same time it allows us to recognise that the introduction of entrepreneurial \nprinciples to those fields which, whether funded by public money or not, had previously been primarily \n 20 \ndefined by welfarist rationalities may undermine the basic principles of cultural democracy. Nikolas \nRose encapsulates the essence of the shift well by describing it in this way, under \nthe rationalities of welfare, social technologies were to civilise individuals, render them \nas citizens with obligations to conduct themselves with prudence in exchange for certain \nguarantees against uncertainty. In the new prudential regimes, individuals, educated \nthrough the mechanisms of marketing and the pedagogies of consumption and lifestyle, \nare to gain access to previously \u201esocial\u201f benefits such as educational advantage, health \nstatus and contentment in old age through purchase in a competitive market. (1996, p. \n343) \nIt is clear that we must scrutinise the predominance of this shift. However, while these advanced liberal \n\u201edeath of the social\u201f changes have been criticised particularly from the Left, the fact that they have been \ntaken up in a variety of milieux indicates their diversity and potency. How are we then to scrutinise this \nshift usefully? Rose has asserted that if \u201ewe are to gain a critical purchase upon these contemporary \nstrategies for the conduct of conduct, it will be, in part through historical investigations which can \nunsettle and de-valorise the regime of subjectification to which they are inextricably linked\u201f (1996b, p. \n147). On this view analyses of the history of cultural formations which reject accounts based on one \nlogic will give us a more productive purchase on contemporary cultural programs if we address \nconjunctions of art, citizenship and government in relation to the concrete conditions of their \napplication and effect. \n 21 \nBibliography \nBaigell, M. and Williams, J. 1986 [1936], Artists Against War and Fascism: Papers of the First \nAmerican Artists' Congress, Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick. \n \nBeckham, S.B. 1989, Depression Post Office Murals and Southern Culture: A Gentle Reconstruction, \nLouisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge. \n \nBennett, Gwendolyn 1973, \u201eThe Harlem Community Art Centre\u201f, in O\u201fConnor F.V., ed., Art for the \nMillions: Essays from the 1930s by artists and Administrators of the WPA Federal Art Project, New \nYork Graphic Society, Boston. \n \nBerman, G. 1975, The Lost Years: Mural Painting in New York City under the Works Progress \nAdministration's Federal Art Project, 1935- 1943, unpublished dissertation Columbia University. \n \nBurroughs, M.G. 1987, \u201eChicago\u201fs South Side Community Art Centre: A Personal Recollection\u201f, \nWhite, J.F., ed., Art in Action: American Art Centres and the New Deal, The Scarecrow Press, London. \n \nCrow, T.E. 1985, Painters and Public Life in Eighteenth-Century Paris, London, Yale University Press. \n \nDavis, Stuart 1973, \u201eAmerican Artists\u201f Congress\u201f in O\u201fConnor, F.V., ed., Art for the Millions: Essays \nfrom the 1930s by Artists and Administrators of the WPA Federal Art Project, New York Graphic \nSociety, Boston. \n \n 22 \nDenning, M. 1998, The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century, \nVerso, London. \n \nFoucault, M. 1991, \u201eGovernmentality\u201f, in The Foucault Effect, Burchell, G. et al, eds., Harvester Press, \nLondon. \n \nGibson, L. 1999, \u201eThe Arts as Industry\u201f, Media International Australia incorporating Culture and \nPolicy, 90, 107-122. \n \nHarris, Jonathan 1995, Federal Art and National Culture: The Politics of Identity in New Deal \nAmerica, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. \n \nHarrison, H.A., \u201eJohn Reed Club Artists and the New Deal: Radical Responses to Roosevelt\u201fs \n\u201cPeaceful Revolution\u201d\u201f, Prospects, 5, 241- 268. \n \nLabor History, 1998, 39, 3.  \n \nMarantz, Irving.
