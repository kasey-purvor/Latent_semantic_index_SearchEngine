Consideration of the subtle distinction between Computer-Aided Learning\n(CAL) and Computer-Aided Instruction (CAI) conform the basis of a possible classification of\ncomputer-mediated learning, and hence of multimedia tools. This classification enables the\ndevelopment of a continuum upon which to place various strategies for computer-mediated\nlearning, and hence a means of broadly classifying multimedia learning tools.\nIt is also important to consider the characteristics of the user when deciding whether to employ\ninteractive multimedia as a tool for learning. Learning style is predisposition to behave in a\nparticular way when engaged in the learning process. Learning strategies are the methods\nemployed by the learner to achieve learning. Taking the work of Pask (serialistlholist) and Kolb\n(learning Style Inventory) as starting points, research is being done to investigate links between\nlearning style and strategy and multimedia. Such knowledge could prove invaluable when\nattempting to design multimedia learning materials for the widest possible educational use.\nIntroduction\nTwo important factors need attention when contemplating how and where to use the new\ncomputer-based learning technologies. Firstly, in order to select the right kind of soft-\nware, it is necessary to have a clear picture of the desired outcomes of a particular\nlearning situation. There are many varieties of interactive multimedia available, and\nmatching the tool to the job should be an early consideration. Of equal, if not greater\nimportance, is the question of whether, for a particular learner, interactive multimedia is\nthe most appropriate learning tool. If there is too great a mismatch between the learning\nstyles and strategies of a particular learner and the given learning environment, learning\nmay be inhibited rather than enhanced.\n12\nALT-] Volume 3 Number I\nThe right tool for the job?\nBehaviourist theories of learning have been largely overshadowed since the 1960s, when\nmodern cognitive psychology began to gain in importance. Generally, behaviourism relies\non a definition of learning as an observable change in behaviour not caused by physical\ndevelopment of the subject, and as such disregards internal learning by a process of\nmaturation. The rationalist\/cognitive approach places the main emphasis on the -\nacquisition, manipulation and recall of abstract symbols, implying a greater interest in the\nmental processes involved with learning. It would be simplistic to assume that theories of\neducation rely exclusively upon either of these extremes. However, they do offer a\nconvenient starting point upon which to build a framework wherein to establish the\ncapabilities of interactive multimedia as a tool for learning.\nTable 1 shows the evolution of the two main strands of computer-mediated learning.\nCAL implies an active role for the student, who is more in charge of the learning process,\nand hence has greater freedom in the management of this learning. CAI suggests that the\nstudent is the recipient and adopts a more passive role.\nTable I: Table io show the relationship between computer-mediated learning and learning theory\n\u2022 Theories of Education\nInstructional Approach Learning Approach\nBehaviourist Cognitivist\nSkinner, Presse\/...

Some of these are shown in Table 2.\nTable 2: Table to show relationship between strategies for computer-mediated learning\nComputer Aided Instruction Computer Aided Learning\n- ^ classification by amount of learner freedom \u2022\ndrill and practice case studies all open styles of learning\nequipment simulations experiment simulations rule-based problern solving\nsome limited problem solving business and strategy games exploration of information bases\nroutine testing creative composition\n13\nPot Paterson and John Rosbottom Learning style and learning strategies\nIn general, CAI leads to a single learning outcome while CAL encourages a variety of\nlearning outcomes. Intelligent tutoring systems, which have been produced as an\napplication of artificial intelligence, develop elaborate models of the expert and the\nstudent but are focused on the support of a single learning outcome. Cognitive tools\n(Jonassen, 1992), on the other hand, are environments that support a wide range of\nlearning tasks in almost any content domain. Between the two extremes, lie microworlds\n(Kommers, 1992), where a more closed environment offers apparently free exploration\nbut limits the conceptual domain in order to focus the attention of the learner. The\nplacing of learning outcomes and environments within the same framework as before is\nshown in Table 3.\nTable 3: Table to show learning outcomes and environments\nComputer Aided Instruction Computer Aided Learning\n- < classification by amount of learner freedom \u2022\nsingle learning outcome multiple learning outcomes\nintelligent tutoring systems microworlds cognitive tools\nThe steadily-increasing range of interactive multimedia applications and authoring\nenvironments can also be placed on the same continuum between CAI and CAL. It is\ncost-effective, both in money and time, to try and match a particular learning situation\nwith a suitable multimedia environment, since much of the complexity of some of the\nmore sophisticated CAL applications may be wasted on a simple CAI implementation.\nTable 4: Table to show placing of some commercial \u00a1MM software\nComputer Aided Instruction Computer Aided Learning\n\u2022 ^ classification by amount of learner freedom \u2022\nself-contained self-contained but allowing completely open\nclosed environments limited links to restricted environment supporting\nrange of external sources almost unrestricted links\neg HyperCard Supercard, Toolbook, Authorware, Guide...

For example, Table 5 shows an overview of\nlearning modes as suggested by Kolb (1984).\nTable 5: Overview of Learning Modes (Kolb)]\nmode\nconcrete experience\nreflective observation\nabstract\nconceptualization\nactive\nexperimentation\nfocus\ninvolvement in experiences\nunderstanding the meaning\nof ideas and situations\nusing logic, ideas, concepts\nactively influencing people\nand changing situations\nemphasis\nfeeling as opposed to thinking\nunderstanding as opposed to\npractical applications\nthinking as opposed to feeling\npractical application as opposed\nto reflective understanding\nThis behaviour is influenced by the ways that learners process information, and how they\nreact to certain learning situations and environments. This will result in certain\npreferences and tendencies to adopt particular habits or patterns, known as learning\nstrategies. These patterns or habits may be liberating or inhibiting, depending on the\nlearning situation, and therefore an understanding of the learning style of the learner is\ndesirable, both for the learner and for the author of learning materials. Once this\ninformation is gained, guidance and advice on the adoption of the most appropriate\nlearning strategies may be formulated.\nThere are several components of learning style, usually categorized as cognitive, affective\nor environmental (e.g. Smith, 1983; Kolb, 1984; Coates, 1991). The cognitive component\nencompasses the internal processes of learning. The affective component pertains to the\nfeelings of the learner, and as such includes aspects such as the measure of structure and\nauthority within the learning situation, which affect the amount of autonomy the learner\nhas, and the expectations and motivation of the learner. The environmental component\nranges from physical considerations of comfort to more abstract influences resulting from\nemotional support. The adoption of a particular learning style may be influenced by the\nlearning task in progress, or by psychological predisposition, or both. Where this\nproduces a conflict, it may be reasonable to assume that the learning process is impaired.\nLearning strategies are the particular habits or patterns espoused when engaged in the\nlearning process. The proficiency of different learners in learning, reasoning and problem-\nsolving varies widely, and so do the strategies they evolve to carry out these activities.\nHayes (1985) raises the possibility that there may be several hundred plausible learning\nand thinking strategies, and identifies at least fifty different strategies that he himself\npresents in a basic learning-strategies course for students. Many researchers (e.g. Hartley\n& Davies, 1976; Rigney, 1978; Tessmer & Jonassen, 1988; Coates, 1991) have examined\n15\nPat Paterson and John Rosboffom Learning style and learning strategies\n-\nf\n1 SECONDARY j jV .\n: - 1 Meta-leamlng I \/ \\\n( PRIMARY \"| X , , 7\n1 Information processing j \\ . ,\nJC Cognitive \\ . \\\nV Afledive Environ- \/\u00edli\u00e9Ma} - \u2022 7\n( Active study ^  \/\nPRIMARY y? - '.'\n| Preparation\/execution | S*\ny SECONDARY j ^ S\n\/\nFigure I: Relationship between components of learning style and primary and secondary learning\nstrategies\nthe field of learning strategies, which has emerged as part of the cognitive science\nrevolution in instructional technology.\nSuccessful learning strategies enable learners to manage their own learning process and\nintegrate new learning into their own existing cognitive structures. Unsuccessful or\ninappropriate learning strategies may inhibit learning (Pask, 1976; Ford, 1985).\nAlthough there is general agreement on what learning strategies are (how one uses one's\nhead when learning) and what they do when successful (help one to learn), the way they\nare viewed varies considerably. Nevertheless, despite the large number and wide variety of\nlearning strategies, it is possible to group them according to how they affect the learning\ncapacity of the learner. The major grouping is into primary strategies, which act on the\ninformation to be learned, and secondary strategies, which provide support for the\nlearner. Primary strategies include information processing strategies, which have more\ninfluence on cognitive aspects of learning style, helping to enhance mental organization\n16\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\nand recall of material, and active study strategies, which often involve physical activities\nsuch as note-taking and seek to improve the affective and environmental components of\nlearning style. Secondary strategies help the learner to establish a suitable mental and\nphysical state for learning and to monitor progress as learning proceeds. These secondary\nstrategies may be considered as meta-learning strategies and preparation\/execution\nstrategies (Tessmer & Jonassen, 1988). The relationship between the cognitive, affective\nand environmental components of learning style, and the broad groupings of learning\nstrategies which may be favoured is shown in Figure 1.\nSome experimental results\nA preliminary study has been.carried out in order to identify some of the links between\nlearning style, learning strategy and the use of interactive multimedia as a tool for\nlearning.\nThe experimental group consisted of course members for the MSc in Information\nSystems, which is a conversion course for students with little background in IT, but a\nwide range of non-IT experience. Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (Kolb, 1984) was used\nto investigate the learning style of each student. Learning strategy for each was broadly\nassessed by means of the single question identified by Clarke (1993) as a possible\nindicator of serialist\/holist tendencies. The application used as a vehicle for the study was\nan interactive guide to the use of a complex telephone console (Paterson, 1990).\nFour different navigational tools were available. These were:\n\u2022 Representational: a graphic of the console and keyboard.\n\u2022 Schematic: a hierarchical map showing the structure and subdivisions of the informa-\ntion available.\n\u2022 Descriptive: a verbal list of information about keys offering more detail than the map\nbot reflecting its structure.\n\u2022 Menu: a pull-down menu listing the high level subdivisions of the information.\nStudents were allowed to browse the application freely until they were confident that they\nunderstood its structure. They were then given a question sheet which grouped questions\nunder six named section headings and asked that these sections be searched to find a total\nof sixteen specific pieces of information. No time restrictions were applied, but all\nstudents completed the work to their own satisfaction within one hour.\nAn analysis of the total number of pages visited during the search for information was\ncarried out so as to establish the potential validity of the data. For 28 subjects, the range\nwas 70 pages (13 min, 83 max), the mean was 47.93, mode was 55.00 and median was\n47.50. It was therefore decided to exclude the lower quartile (<33 pages) from analysis of\npreference for navigational tools on the grounds that the search for information was too\ncursory to produce a meaningful pattern.\n17\nPat Poterson and John Rosbottom Learning style and learning strategies\nAnalysis of paths taken through the interactive-multimedia application shows distinct\npreferences by different users for different navigational tools. Representational\n(graphic\/picture of telephone console), Schematic (map), Descriptive (verbal listing of\nkeys on console) and Menu (pull-down list) tools were all freely available. In order to\ncompare preferences, ratios of visits between pairs of tools were calculated from the\noriginal totals of visits. Boxplots were made of the ratios console\/keylist, console\/map and\nkeylist\/map (Figure 2).\nF\/gure 2: Boxplot to show comparisons between preferences for navigational tools\nThe horizontal line at ratio = 1 represents equal preference. It can be seen that the console\nwas clearly preferred over both the keylist and the map, and that there was a slight\npreference for the keylist over the map. This result was unexpected, since the most\ncommonly provided navigational tool is usually the map. .\nAs described above, it was decided to exclude the lower quartile (<33 pages) from analysis\nof preference for navigational tools. This raised the question as to whether there was any\ndiscernible consistent reason for the cursory nature of the search as performed by these\nsubjects.\nScatter plots of combined learning-style scores obtained form the Kolb analysis were\nplotted against number of pages searched, and the result of the active-reflective versus\npages searched may be significant (Figure 3).\nIt can be seen that for all subjects whose searches were considered cursory, their\n18\nALT-J Volume 3 Number I\na\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne\nr\ne\nf\nI\ne\nc\nt\nI\nV\ne\n10-r\n8->\n6'-\n4 \"\n2 \"\n- 2 -\n-4\"\n-6..\n-8..\n-1O-\n-\n14.\n10\nH\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nnumber of pages searched\nFigure 3: Scatterpbt of combined active-reflective learning style (Kolb) and number of pages searched\norientation towards reflective observation, which emphasizes understanding as opposed\nto practical application, outweighs their orientation towards active experimentation (that\nis, their combination score on the active-reflective axis is <=0). The relevance of this is a\nmatter for conjecture, and needs much more investigation, but it might correspond to a\nreluctance to delve too deeply into an unfamiliar computer environment such as\ninteractive multimedia.\nA further exploration of the data suggested an investigation of correlation of learning\nstrategy with preferred navigational tool. A snapshot picture of serialist\/holist tendency\nfor each student was obtained using the following question (Clarke, 1993):\nWhen I'm reading a book (or other\ninformation source) for my studies,\nI prefer to spend quite a long time\nskimming over and dipping into it\nto get a clear picture of what it's\nabout and how it will be relevant\nWhen I'm reading a book (or other\ninformation source) for my studies,\n12 3 4 5 I prefer to get quite soon into a\nfairly detailed reading of it once I\nknow it's going to be useful, in the\nknowledge that its precise relevance\nand contribution will become clear\nfrom a detailed reading\nWhile plots of console\/keylist and console\/map ratios showed an even spread across\nbreadth-first depth-first strategies, the keylist\/map ratio (which indicated no real\npreference for either tool - see Figure 2) was more interesting. Figure 4 shows the keylist\/\nmap ratio plotted against breadth-first\/depth-first learning style preferences.\n19\nPat Paterson and John Rosbottom Learning style and learning strategies\nK\n 4 +\ne\ny\nI 3+\ni\nS\nt 2 t\nm\na of\nP\n-1, breadth first depth first\nO 1\nLearning strategy\nFigure 4: Plot to show relationship between keylist\/map ratios and preferred learning strategies\nThe keylist is a descriptive tool which offers more detail than the map, and seems to be\npreferred by those who adopt a global approach to problem solving. Since a map is\nusually assumed to give the best overview, this result was somewhat unexpected.\nHowever, it may be that on this occasion the detail given in the keylist gave the better\noverview, and that the map encouraged a more linear approach.\nFuture work\nClearly, this preliminary exercise has produced more questions than it has answered. The\nstudy is being extended to include field dependence\/independence tests (Witkin et al,\n1977) and further experiments are in progress. It is possible that for some students, the\nincreased use of interactive multimedia as a learning tool may be a potential handicap\ninstead of the expected advantage.\nReferences\nClarke, J.
