INTRODUCTION\nSilicon, one of the most widely used materials in the elec-\ntronics industry, often contains carbon to inhibit the diffusion\nof dopants such as boron because the outdiffusion of boron\nfrom as-grown regions can significantly degrade device\nperformance.1 But carbon itself diffuses surprisingly fast.\nThis study examines whether the strain interaction energy\nbetween point defects contributes to the fast diffusion of car-\nbon in silicon crystals.\nImplantation of boron in silicon by ion beam causes an\nexcess of silicon self-interstitials.2 Ion implantation also in-\ntroduces defects into the crystal which are repaired by an-\nnealing at a temperature of about 800 \u00b0C. Boron diffuses by\nkick-in and kick-out reactions with silicon interstitials,3,4 as\nillustrated in Fig. 1 and diffuses particularly fast during\nannealing.2 Diffusion of dopants is undesirable; the dopant\nprofile needs to be kept sharply steplike and this becomes\nmore important as device sizes reduce. Carbon is therefore\nadded to provide a sink for the self-interstitials, inhibiting the\ndiffusion of boron.2,5,6 But carbon itself diffuses fast; it is\neven more diffusive in silicon than boron.7 Like boron, car-\nbon diffuses by kick-out and kick-in reactions with silicon\ninterstitials8 in which a silicon interstitial kicks a substitu-\ntional carbon atom out from a lattice site moving the carbon\natom into an interstitial site. The carbon interstitial then\n\u201ckicks in,\u201d replacing a silicon atom on a lattice site, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 1.\nModels in which the carbon substitutional and the silicon\ninterstitial meet each other by chance do not account for the\nobserved fast rate of diffusion of carbon in silicon, unless a\nlarge value is attributed to the capture radius \u0001a fitting param-\neter representing the separation distance within which a re-\naction is inevitable9\u0002. One contributory factor might be the\nstrain fields associated with a carbon substitutional and a\nsilicon interstitial interact, which produce an attractive force\nbetween the two defects. The interaction energy may produce\na \u201cpotential well\u201d that draws two defects towards each other\nincreasing the effective capture radius.\nIn this paper, we estimate the strain interaction energy\nbetween a silicon self-interstitial and a carbon substitutional\nusing two different approaches. In the first method, which is\nakin to a local force model, the defects were modeled as\ncubic inclusions in a silicon continuum using a Green\u2019s func-\ntion method to estimate the interaction energy due to the\nstrain fields. Secondly, we used atomistic simulation as an\napproximation in which the silicon interstitial was repre-\nsented by a larger substitutional and the carbon by a smaller\nsubstitutional in a lattice of silicon atoms. These two ap-\nproaches were chosen to provide estimates of the defect in-\nteraction energy over complementary length scales, the con-\ntinuum Green\u2019s function approach valid for larger distances,\nand the atomistic simulations for defect pair separations of a\nfew unit cells. This work is complementary to that of Hobler\nand Kresse10 who presented results for interstitial and va-\ncancy pair defects in silicon using ab initio for defect pairs\nseparated by up to two unit cells.\nThe first of the two models, the Green\u2019s function ap-\nproach, is based on the local force model, which is one of the\nsimplest models of a point defect in continuum elasticity. A\npair of opposing forces is placed along each axis11 around\nthe defect, equivalent to inserting a spherical inclusion into a\nspherical hole of initially different size.12 Green\u2019s functions\nand Radon11 or Fourier12,13 transforms can then be used to\ncalculate strain and interaction energy. A refinement of this\nmodel, more suitable for the near field, is the \u201cnonlocal\u201d\ncontinuum model, which places an array of radial forces at\nthe positions of the defect\u2019s first and second neighbor\natoms.14 The forces used in this model are derived from the\nharmonic lattice model developed by Bullough and Hardy.15\nAll of these models are capable of describing an anisotropic\nmaterial such as silicon.

In the\nlocal force model the elastic interaction energy between two\ndefects is proportional to d\u22123 while the nonlocal force and\nharmonic lattice models predict a d\u22125 relation.12,16,17 The har-\nmonic lattice model predicts that, for Cu, the interaction en-\nergy between two like point defects is negative when they\nare both lying on the \u0001100\u0002 crystal axis and positive in the\n\u0001110\u0002 and \u0001111\u0002 orientations. The Green\u2019s function model\ndescribed in the following section produces a similar conclu-\nsion for silicon \u0001with signs reversed for the two unlike de-\nfects\u0002.\nThe second approach to the estimation of the interaction\nenergy of a carbon substitutional and a silicon self-interstitial\nis based on a simple atomistic model. Standard classical in-\nteratomic potentials are used and a molecular dynamics\npackage is used to calculate the system energy at 0 K. This\napproach has been used, for example, to estimate the strain\nenergies in semiconductor materials.18\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we derive\nthe expression for strain interaction energy and describe both\nthe Green\u2019s functions and atomistic methods. Results are pre-\nsented in Sec. III. Despite the substantial differences in ap-\nproach and the approximations used, both methods are\nshown to draw quantitatively similar results. Finally, the con-\nclusions are presented in Sec. IV.\nII. THEORY\nA. Green\u2019s function method\nStrain energy w per unit volume is defined as\nw =\n1\n2\n\u0005ij\u0006ij =\n1\n2\nCijkl\u0006kl\u0006ij , \u00011\u0002\nwhere \u0005, \u0007, and C are the stress, strain, and stiffness tensors,\nthe subscripts represent the three dimensions in space, and\nthe sum is taken over all values of repeated indices. Total\nenergy W in a volume V is given by\nW =\u0004 12Cijkl\u0006kl\u0006ijdV . \u00012\u0002\nAssuming stresses and strains add linearly, the strain energy\ndensity due to two point defects is\nw\u00011+2\u0002 =\n1\n2\nCijkl\u0001\u0006ij\n\u00011\u0002 + \u0006ij\n\u00012\u0002\u0002\u0001\u0006kl\n\u00011\u0002 + \u0006kl\n\u00012\u0002\u0002\n=\n1\n2\nCijkl\u0001\u0006ij\n\u00011\u0002\u0006kl\n\u00011\u0002 + \u0006ij\n\u00012\u0002\u0006kl\n\u00012\u0002 + \u0006ij\n\u00011\u0002\u0006kl\n\u00012\u0002 + \u0006ij\n\u00012\u0002\u0006kl\n\u00011\u0002\u0002 . \u00013\u0002\nThe first two terms are the energy densities associated with\nsingle defects and are not affected by the presence of the\nsecond defect. The last two terms are the energy densities\n\bw associated with the interaction between the two defects.\nThe interaction energy \bW is therefore given by\n\bW =\n1\n2 \u0004 Cijkl\u0001\u0006kl\u00011\u0002\u0006ij\u00012\u0002 + \u0006kl\u00012\u0002\u0006ij\u00011\u0002\u0002dV =\u0004 Cijkl\u0006ij\u00011\u0002\u0006kl\u00012\u0002dV ,\n\u00014\u0002\nsince Cijkl=Cklij.\nIn the Green\u2019s function model, at the site of the silicon\ninterstitial, a silicon unit cell is removed and replaced by a\nlarger cube, which is initially compressed to fit into the unit\ncell. The initial strain inside the cube, before the system is\nallowed to relax, is known as misfit strain, and is uniform\nthroughout the cell and zero elsewhere. When the system\nrelaxes, the cube expands and a nonuniform strain arises in-\nside and outside the cell. The carbon substitutional is repre-\nsented by a corresponding smaller cube replacing a unit cell\nof silicon; thus the misfit strain has the opposite sign to that\nof the interstitial cell. The use of a cube is arbitrary, but the\nstrain field a distance of just one unit cell away from the\nsource of the strain is almost independent of the shape of the\nsource.19\nIt is now necessary to estimate the effective misfit strain\nof a cube of silicon, which contains an extra atom in the form\nof an interstitial. Misfit strain \u0006* for a small volume of ma-\nterial A embedded in material B is defined as\n\u0006* =\naB \u2212 aA\naA\n, \u00015\u0002\nwhere aA and aB are the lattice constants of A and B. The\nlattice constant of silicon is 0.543 nm. The cell which in-\ncludes the silicon interstitial contains nine atoms instead of\nthe usual eight. The unstrained volume of nine silicon atoms\nis therefore 9\/8 of a normal silicon unit cell. To find a char-\nacteristic length, comparable with a, we take the cube root of\nthe volume. Hence the representative misfit strain of the sili-\ncon cell containing an interstitial is given by\n\u0006SiI\n*\n=\n1 \u2212 \u0001 98\u00021\/3\n\u0001 98\u00021\/3\n. \u00016\u0002\nThe cell representing the carbon substitutional contains\nseven silicon atoms and one carbon atom, so the total un-\nstrained volume is taken to be 78aSi\n3 + 18aC\n3\n, and the misfit strain\nis given by\n\u0006C\n*\n=\naSi \u2212 \u0001 78aSi3 + 18aC3 \u00021\/3\n\u0001 78aSi3 + 18aC3 \u00021\/3\n. \u00017\u0002\nA Green\u2019s function method is used to deduce the relax-\nation strains. A Green\u2019s function is the response \u0001in this case\nthe strain response\u0002 at a field point \u0001anywhere in the crystal\u0002\ndue to a unit impulse at a source point \u0001inside one of the cells\ncontaining a point defect\u0002. Integrating over the volume where\nimpulses occur \u0001in this case, the defect cell\u0002 gives the total\nresponse. We used the Green\u2019s tensors developed by Faux\net al.20,21 for materials with cubic anisotropy based on the\nwork of Mura and Kinoshita.22 Faux\u2019s method is particularly\nsuitable for this computationally intensive problem as the\nGreen\u2019s functions form an infinite polynomial series, where\nthe first term describes the isotropic case and subsequent\nterms are successively higher-order corrections for aniso-\nCHRISTMAS, FAUX, AND COWERN PHYSICAL REVIEW B 76, 205205 \u00012007\u0002\n205205-2\ntropy, and they are therefore fast to compute. Faux has\nshown that truncation after the third term produces an excel-\nlent approximation to the exact solution.20 The more general\nand more complex method of Pan23,24 takes into account the\npiezoelectric effect \u0001zero for silicon\u0002 and can be expressed as\na surface integral, which is useful for dealing with the nu-\nmerical singularities that arise when integrating through the\nsource volume.\nThe calculation involved two nested sets of numerical in-\ntegrals; first, integration is required over source points to\ncalculate the strain at a field point due to each of the two\npoint defects then, second, the product of these strains is\nintegrated over field points in a large volume of material\nsurrounding the point defects in order to calculate the total\nstrain interaction energy \u0005Eq. \u00014\u0002\u0006. Three different defect ori-\nentations were modeled with defects orientated along the\n\u0001100\u0002, \u0001110\u0002, and the \u0001111\u0002 crystal axes, respectively. The\ngeometry of our model is shown in Fig. 2. For symmetry\nreasons it was only necessary to take field points in 1\/8 of the\ntotal volume in the \u0001100\u0002 and \u0001110\u0002 cases \u00051\/4 of the total\nvolume in the \u0001111\u0002 case\u0006.\nIn the case of the inner integral, a Simpson weighting was\nused to increase the accuracy. For field points close to the\ndefects, the mesh was refined by a factor of 3. The disadvan-\ntage of integrating over a source volume as opposed to a\nsurface integral over the source surface is that the interaction\nenergy is highly sensitive to the distance from a field point to\nthe closest source point. So, for field points inside the defect\ncell, we assumed a uniform value for the strain throughout\nthe cell. This value of the constant strain used in this region\nwas based on the strain at the center of the cell as calculated\nby the Pan method23 \u0001which uses a surface integral\u0002. This\napproximation introduces an error of less than 8% in the total\nstrain interaction energy.\nThe field points extend 200 cells beyond the source points\nin each direction. By a semi-analytical integration out to in-\nfinity, we have determined that this accounts for more than\n99.96% of the total strain interaction energy of an infinitely\nlarge silicon crystal containing the two defects, since the\nstrain decays as r\u22123, where r is the distance between the\nsource point and the field point. For field points far from the\nsource points, the density of field points was reduced to save\ncomputational time.\nWe used the following material parameters for silicon:\nelastic stiffness C11=166 GPa, C12 \u0001Lame constant \t\u0002\n=64 GPa, C44 \u0001Lame constant \n\u0002=79.6 GPa, lattice constant\na=0.543 nm. For carbon we used the lattice constant of dia-\nmond \u00010.356 nm\u0002. In each of the three orientations we took a\nrange of distances d between point defects. The model is\nprobably only valid for d\u0001\u000710 unit cells or 5 nm.\nB. Atomistic method\nAtomistic calculations were undertaken, first, to check the\norder of magnitude of the strain interaction energies obtained\nby continuum calculations as described in the previous sec-\ntion and, second, as a means of obtaining reasonable esti-\nmates of the strain interaction energies at shorter distances.\nWe adopt a simplistic model in which a silicon crystal has\ntwo atoms replaced, one by a siliconlike atom with a larger\nsize \u0001to represent the interstitial\u0002 and one replaced by a\nsmaller siliconlike atom \u0001to approximate the carbon intersti-\ntial\u0002. This model has obvious shortcomings and would not be\nexpected to accurately simulate the real defect pair especially\nat very short distances but should serve to check the reason-\nableness of Green\u2019s function calculation, recognizing that the\nGreen\u2019s function calculation is itself subject to approxima-\ntions, and extend the range of the energy calculation to\nsomewhat shorter distances. The key approximations inher-\nent in the atomistic model is the size of the Si-like atoms to\nbest approximate the interstitial silicon and substitutional\ncarbon. We acknowledge, also, that there are more sophisti-\ncated interatomic potentials than the Stillinger-Weber\/Jian\nset used here including potentials which explicitly treat\nsilicon-carbon interactions which are likely to produce a\nmore accurate numerical result for the interaction energy. It\nis also noted that a major contribution to the energy is due to\nthe strain of the many atoms surrounding the defects and the\naccuracy of the various interatomic potentials at high distor-\ntions is not known.\nThe atomistic computer simulations are performed on a\ncube of silicon with dimensions of 23\u000b0.543 095 nm con-\n(100) orientation\ny\nxz\nSi interstitial\nfield point\nsource point\nC substitutional\n(111): point defects at z=x\n(110): point defects at z=0\nx\nC substitutional\nSi interstitial\ny\nz\nFIG. 2.

The potentials defined\nabove are used for atoms L and S with just the parameter \u0005\nchanging to reflect the different sizes of the substitutional\ndefects. All other parameters associated with either the two-\nbody or the three-body potential are unchanged. The atomis-\ntic simulations represent approximations to the real system\nand, therefore, it is difficult to assign appropriate values to \u0005\nfor the defect atoms. For example, Eqs. \u00016\u0002 and \u00017\u0002 produce\nvalues of \u00033% for the magnitude of the effective misfit\nstrain for either the silicon interstitial or the carbon substitu-\ntional.

Even\nthough this systematic error is small, as a similar conver-\ngence criterion is used for all simulations, these systematic\nerrors subtract out once the difference between energies is\ntaken.\nSimulations were run for atoms S and L separated by 1\u20137\ncell dimensions in the \u0001100\u0002 direction and 1\u20134.25 cell dimen-\nsions in the \u0001111\u0002 direction, a maximum separation of about\n4 nm.\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nFigure 3 shows the interaction energy between a Si inter-\nstitial and a C substitutional separated by up to 15 nm, cal-\nculated by the atomistic and the continuum Green\u2019s function\nmethods. Figures 4 and 5 show the same data, but on a\nsemilogarithmic plot extending out to a separation of\n100 nm.\nThe quantitative agreement between results from the ato-\nmistic and continuum models is impressive considering the\nvarious approximations used. Both indicate that strain inter-\naction energy \bW between a silicon interstitial and a carbon\nsubstitutional is less than about 0.04 meV, equivalent to a\ntemperature of 5 K, for separation distances greater than\n5 nm. This is small compared to kT at room temperature\n\u000125 meV\u0002 or higher. We can conclude that strain interaction\npotential does not play a significant role in attracting point\ndefects to each other at distances greater than 5 nm except at\nlow temperatures.\nBoth atomistic and continuum models agree that, for de-\nfects aligned along \u0001100\u0002, the interaction energy \bW is posi-\ntive \u0001so defects repel each other\u0002. They also agree that in the\n\u0001111\u0002 orientation \u0001at least at d\u00012 nm\u0002 \bW is negative\n0 5 10 15\nseparation distance (nm)\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.15\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0.15\n0.2\nIn\nte\nra\nct\nio\nn\nen\ner\ngy\n(m\neV\n)\n(100)\n(111)\nFIG. 3.

Our con-\ntinuum model also predicts that the defects attract each other\nin the \u0001110\u0002 orientation. This is consistent with the results of\nMasumura,13 Schaefer,28 Shneck,12 and others, all of whom\nuse the local force model. All of these are studies of Cu,\nwhich has cubic symmetry and the same sign of anisotropy\ncoefficient \u0001C11\u2212C12\u22122C44\u0002 as Si, so would be expected to\nbehave in a similar way.\nThe difference in sign of energy between the various ori-\nentations can be explained as follows. The total interaction\nenergy is dominated by the contributions from field points\ninside the defect cell, very close to the source. The element\nof strain energy density for a field point inside defect cell \u00011\u0002\nis given by\nw = Cijkl\u0007ij\n\u00011\u0002\u0007kl\n\u00012\u0002 \u000110\u0002\nas in Eq. \u00014\u0002. At the center of defect cell \u00011\u0002, \u0007ij\n\u00011\u0002 is a scalar\nmultiple \u0007\u00011\u0002 of the identity matrix; let us assume it is posi-\ntive, like that of the carbon substitutional. Thus the interac-\ntion energy wcen at the center of source \u00011\u0002 is\nwcen = \u0001C11 + 2C12\u0002\u0007\u00011\u0002\u0007ii\n\u00012\u0002 \u000111\u0002\nwhere \u0007ii\n\u00012\u0002 is the trace of the tensor for strain inside cell \u00011\u0002\ndue to defect \u00012\u0002. \u0001C11+2C12\u0002 is always positive. The sign of\nwcen \u0001and thus of \bW\u0002 is therefore the same as that of\nTr\u0001\u0007ij\n\u00012\u0002\u0002. Assuming that defect \u00012\u0002 has negative misfit strain,\nlike the silicon interstitial, Tr\u0001\u0007ij\n\u00012\u0002\u0002 is positive when the two\ndefects are oriented along \u0001100\u0002, which is a soft direction,\nbut negative along the hard directions \u0001110\u0002 and \u0001111\u0002. This\nobservation accords with the arguments of Shneck.12 Of\ncourse, the curves would coincide for an isotropic medium.\nThe atomistic simulation found a large positive \bW\n\u0001about 2 meV, not shown on the graphs\u0002 for d\u0002\u00071 nm in\n\u0001111\u0002 orientation, in the configuration where the defects are\nat the corner of their unit cells. This agrees with the findings\nof Shneck.12 The continuum model would not be valid at\nsuch a small separation. This result suggests that the strain\ninteraction energy may only contribute to the diffusion pro-\ncess once the two defects are close, less than about 3 nm.\nThe straight lines on the semilogarithmic plots imply that\nstrain interaction energy is proportional to d\u22123, which agrees\nwith the literature on the local force model.12 This follows\nfrom the fact that the strain Green\u2019s function for a particular\norientation is proportional to r\u22123, where r is the distance\nfrom the source point to the field point.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe modeled two point defects in a Si crystal \u0001a C substi-\ntutional and a Si interstitial\u0002 as inclusions in a continuous\nmedium, and separately as large and small substitutionals in\nan atomistic simulation. The strain interaction energy \bW\nbetween a Si interstitial and a C substitutional is found to be\n\u0002 0.04 meV for separation distance d\u0001 5 nm. This indicates\nthat strain interaction energy plays a negligible part in the\ndiffusion of C in Si at room temperature or above at dis-\ntances greater than about 5 nm. The strain interaction energy\nmay contribute to the diffusion process at low temperatures\nand\/or once the two defects are less than about 3 nm apart.\nThe potential between the defects due to the strain is re-\npulsive if they are oriented along the \u0001100\u0002 axis, but attrac-\ntive along \u0001110\u0002 and \u0001111\u0002. \bW is proportional to d\u22123.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nU.M.E. acknowledges the support of Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences Research Council \u0001UK\u0002.\n0.1 1.0 10.0 100.0\nSeparation distance (nm)\n0.0001\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\n0.0\n10\n100\nIn\nte\nra\nct\nio\nn\nen\ner\ngy\n(m\neV\n)\n(100) atomistic\n(100) continuum\nFIG. 4.
