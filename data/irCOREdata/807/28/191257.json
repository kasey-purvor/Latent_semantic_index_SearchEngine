It is proposed that this is due \nto the paedomorphic retention of the larval optics through the process of neoteny.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe family Spongicolidae includes 28 species of marine \ndecapod crustaceans of which members of only one genus, \nMicroprosthema, are free living. The remainder are commensal \nin hexactinellid sponges with paired adult shrimps (known \nas wedding shrimps) remaining entrapped within the cavity \nof the host through most of their life cycle (Saito & Takeda, \n2003).  Members of the infraorder Stenopodidea, they are \nclosely related to the caridean shrimps (Richter & Scholtz, \n2001).\nSpongicoloides koehleri (Caullery, 1896) was first described \nfrom the Bay of Biscay, although specimens have subsequently \nbeen taken from the Norfolk Canyon, off Virginia USA. \nPrevious specimens of S. koehleri have been recovered at \ndepths between 500 and 1000 m from Regadrella phoenix \nSchmidt, 1880 although most related shrimps are found in \nsponges of the genus Euplectella (Saito & Takeda, 2003). The \ntaxonomic positions of the various species of Spongicolidea \nare currently being redefined (Saito & Takeda, 2003) which \nwill probably result in the species being transferred to the \ngenus Spongiocaris (J. Goy, personal communication).\nMost adult decapod shrimps possess compound eyes of \nthe reflecting superposition type (Land, 1976; Gaten, 1998), \nthe only exceptions being Gennadas and related genera in \nthe family Benthesicyminidae (Nilsson, 1990). Within the \nStenopodidea, Stenopus hispidus uses this type of optics (Richter, \n2002) although the optics used by shrimps within the family \nSpongicolidae have not been recorded. In this paper the \nunique eyes of Spongicoloides koehleri are described for the first \ntime and their possible evolutionary origins discussed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nHexactinellid sponges (not identified to species) were \ncollected using the Johnson-Sea-Link submersible at depths \nof between 510 and 550 m off the coast of South Carolina, \nUSA (31\u00b044'N 79\u00b005'W). Adult specimens of Spongiocaris \nkoehleri were removed from the cavity of the sponge and \nfixed whole, on the ship, in either 10% formalin or 4% \nglutaraldehyde. The specimens were later identified by Dr \nJ. W. Goy of Harding University, Arkansas, USA.\nAfter the specimens were brought to the UK, the eyes \nwere removed, dehydrated and embedded in Spurr resin. \nThey were sectioned at a thickness of 1 \u00b5m, mounted on \nglass slides and stained in 1% toluidine blue in 1% borax \nsolution.\nRESULTS\nThe adult specimens of Spongiocaris koehleri were almost \ntransparent at the time of capture. A pair of stalked \ncompound eyes (approximately 1 mm in diameter in an adult \nspecimen) was present beneath the rostrum (Figure 1A). The \neyes contained very little shielding pigment, although they \nappeared pink when the animal was alive (P.J. Herring, \npersonal communication).  This  was probably due to the \npresence of the visual pigment rhodopsin within the rhabdoms. \nWhen seen from the lateral aspect, the eye appeared to possess \na ring of dark pigment (Figure 1B) which, when the eye was \nviewed dorsally, could be seen to extend diagonally across the \neye (Figure 1C). There was also an incomplete proximal ring \nof dark pigment around the junction between the eye and the \neyestalk. The facets appeared to be circular and around 80 \nto 85 \u00b5m in diameter. They were not arranged in any clearly \ndefined pattern (Figure 1B).\nLongitudinal sections through the eye show a cone cell \nlayer and a retinula cell layer, each constituting about half of \nthe length of the ommatidia (Figure 2A). The eye has a wide \nfield of view (around 230\u00b0 in the antero-posterior plane) and \na broad inter-ommatidial angle (about 5\u00b0, measured from the \nsectioned eye). Distally there is a thin, parallel-sided cornea \nwith two corneagenous cells immediately underneath (Figure \n2B). The crystalline cones are formed by four cone cells with \nrounded nuclei that fill much of the distal part of the cells. \nIn transverse section, the cones appear rounded over most \nof their length but they are not of a regular shape (Figure \n2C). The cones narrow proximally to form a cone stalk with \nEdward Gaten\nDepartment of Biology, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK. E-mail: gat@le.ac.uk\n484 E. Gaten     Compound eyes of Spongicoloides koehleri\nJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (2007)\nno noticeable change in density. The proximal ends of the \ncones project through the layer of retinula cell nuclei and \nabut the distal ends of the rhabdoms (Figure 2B).\nThe distal part of the rhabdom has three lobes (Figure \n2D) whereas the proximal rhabdoms are more rounded in \ncross section (Figure 2E). The rhabdoms are short (up to 85 \n\u00b5m in length), extending no more than half of the depth of \nthe retinula cell layer (Figure 2B), and they are indistinctly \nbanded.\nOccasional nuclei can be seen below the rhabdoms \nwhich may belong to tapetal cells although no eyeshine \nwas seen in the live specimens. Retinula cell axons extend \nthrough the basement membrane and project to the lamina \nganglionaris.\nNo shielding pigment was found in any of the retinula cells \nor in between the cones in distal pigment cells (except for the \nthin ring of pigment mentioned earlier).\nDISCUSSION\nThe reflecting superposition eyes of shrimp-like decapods \nfrom shallow water are constructed according to a consistent \npattern (e.g. Palaeomonetes pugio\u2014Doughtie & Rao, 1984). \nThe basic constituents include crystalline cones that are \nsquare in cross section; distal pigment cells containing \nmobile shielding and reflecting pigments; retinula cells \ncontaining mobile proximal shielding pigment; fusiform \nrhabdoms built up of alternating layers of microvilli; and a \ntapetum below the rhabdom layer.\nWith increasing depth, many of these characteristics are \nmodified in various crustacean species as they adapt to the \ndecrease in available light. These include loss of mobility \nof the pigments and an overall reduction in the quantity of \nshielding pigment in the eye (Gaten et al., 1990). Changes \nare also apparent in the structure of the rhabdoms of \nmesopelagic shrimps (Gaten et al., 2003) as they seek to \nmaximize absolute sensitivity or contrast enhancement \n(Gaten et al., 2004).\nHowever, the eye of Spongiocaris koehleri shows departures \nfrom the characteristics seen in the eyes of shallow water \ndecapods that do not seem to be related to the increased \ndepth at which the animals were found. The major \ndifferences seen are the presence of circular facets and the \nlack of shielding pigment within the eye.\nSquare-faceted reflecting superposition eyes are found \nin most decapods, with the exception of various crabs, \nhermit crabs and shrimps of the family Benthesicyminidae \n(formerly Aristeidae\u2014Gaten, 1998). Circular facets are \nfound in apposition, refracting superposition and parabolic \nsuperposition eyes (Nilsson, 1989). The characteristics of \nsuperposition eyes include the presence of a clear zone \nbetween the crystalline cones and the rhabdoms and a means \nof redirecting the light within the dioptric layer to the target \nrhabdom. The virtual absence of any shielding pigment \nwithin the eyes of S. koehleri means that the concept of a clear \nzone did not apply to these eyes. The crystalline cones did not \nshow any of the adaptations seen in superposition eyes, such \nas square mirror boxes (reflecting superposition), parabolic \ncurvature of the cone walls (parabolic superposition) or \nany sign of a refractive index gradient (usually detectable \nby variable staining in the crystalline cones of refracting \nsuperposition eyes). No eyeshine, another common \nindicator of superposition optics, was reported from the live \nanimals. Although larval decapod eyes show preadaptations \nFigure 1.

Gaten     Compound eyes of Spongicoloides koehleri\nJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (2007)\nfor superposition image formation in the absence of distal \nshielding pigment (Nilsson, 1983), proximal pigment \nwould be required in this eye to avoid the problem of light \nstimulating adjacent, non-target rhabdoms.\nShielding pigment was not seen in the eyes of S. koehleri \nexcept for a small amount around the margin of the eye and \nin a circle facing laterally. Shielding pigments normally serve \nto reduce the amount of light reaching the rhabdoms, but \nno function can be ascribed to the small amount of pigment \nseen in this case.\nThe combination of virtually unpigmented eyes and \ncircular facets is only commonly found in larval crustaceans \nwhich all use apposition optics initially and which rely on \ntransparency for camouflage in the planktonic environment \n(Nilsson, 1983). The combination of a wide field of view and \nlow resolution (large inter-ommatidial angle) are also typical \nof larval eyes. The major difference between larval eyes \nand the adult eyes of S. koehleri is the absence of proximal \nshielding pigment, resulting in a further loss of resolution.\nMost deep-water spongicolids, including S. koehleri, produce \nsmall numbers of large eggs with juveniles hatching directly \nfrom the eggs (Saito & Takeda, 2003). Such lecithotrophic \ndevelopment is seen in other mesopelagic decapods (see \nGaten & Herring, 1995) although in these cases, the newly-\nhatched juveniles bear eyes that already show evidence of \nthe development of reflecting superposition optics. \nThe presence of reflecting superposition eyes in most \nother shrimp-like decapods (Gaten, 1998) and within \nother members of the infraorder Stenopodidea (Richter, \n2002) indicates that this type of optics is plesiomorphic \nfor this group. Given that paedomorphosis has often been \nimplicated in crustacean evolution (e.g. Gould, 1977; \nRichter, 2002), I would suggest that the unique eyes of \nspongicolid shrimps have arisen through this process. It \nhas been suggested that neoteny is a possible explanation \nfor the presence of apposition optics in brachyuran eyes \n(Land, 1980), although in their case a heavily pigmented and \nrelatively high resolution eye results. In the eyes of S. koehleri, \nthe apposition optics that are retained in the adult are of low \nresolution, implying that life within the cavity of a sponge \nrequires sensitivity to light, but not the resolution of any fine \ndetail, requirements fulfilled by the neotenous retention of \nthe larval eye.\nIt is not clear how the retention of apposition optics would \nbenefit this species. Apposition eyes are apparently sufficient \nfor locating the sponge initially as a juvenile and later when \napproaching sexual maturity (Saito et al., 2001). Further \nspecialization of the eyes would presumably be of no real \nadvantage in the light-deprived environment of the adults. \nGould (1977) has suggested that neoteny in animals showing \nextended parental care of the young (K selected) results in \nretarded differentiation of juvenile features. In the case of \nS. koehleri the avoidance of overspecialization of the eye (in \nthe form of superposition optics) would result in a smaller \neye with fewer facets compared to most other shrimp-like \ndecapods, possibly leading to a reduction in metabolic cost \nto the animal.\nI would like to thank Professor Peter Herring (National \nOceanography Centre, UK) who caught the shrimps and brought \nthem to my attention; Dr Joe Goy (Harding College, Arkansas, \nUSA) who kindly identified the specimens; and Dr Stefan Richter \n(Friedrich-Schiller-Universit\u00e4t Jena, Germany) for his expert \ninsight into the process of paedomorphosis.\nREFERENCES\nDoughtie, D.G. & Rao, K.R., 1984.
