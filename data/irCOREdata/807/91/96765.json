In 1995, a bit-\nstring computer simulation model for population evolution\nwas introduced by Penna \u00031\u0004, which encompasses the inher-\nitance, mutation, evolution, and aging phenomena. The\nPenna model has been so successful that it has rapidly estab-\nlished itself as a major model for population simulations.\nOn the other hand, complex networks composed of a large\nset of interconnected vertices of various kinds are ubiquitous\nin nature and society \u00032\u0004. Examples include the Internet, the\nWorld Wide Web, communication networks, food webs, bio-\nlogical neural networks, electrical power grids, social and\neconomic relations, coauthorship and citation networks of\nscientists, cellular and metabolic networks, etc. In recent\nyears, many properties of complex networks have been re-\nported in the literature. Notably, it is found that many com-\nplex networks show the small-world property \u00033\u0004, which im-\nplies that a network has a high degree of clustering as in a\nregular network and a small average distance between verti-\nces as in a random network. Another significant recent dis-\ncovery is the observation that many large-scale complex net-\nworks are scale-free \u00034\u0004. This means that the degree\ndistributions of these complex networks follow a power-law\nform P\u0001k\u0002\u0005k\u2212\u0002 for large k, where P\u0001k\u0002 is the probability that\na vertex in the network is connected to k other vertices and \u0002\nis a positive real number determined by the given network. It\nis also found that many social networks exhibit assortative\nmixing, the tendency for vertices in networks that have many\nconnections to be connected to other vertices with many con-\nnections \u00035,6\u0004.\nIf we consider social interactions among individuals in the\nPenna model, the individuals \u0001vertices\u0002 and the social inter-\nactions \u0001links\u0002 will form a complex network. In this paper,\nwe first make some modifications on the Penna model. We\nmodify the Verhulst factor to control the birth of individuals\nin the population, and introduce activity-based preferential\nreproduction of offspring in the Penna model, that is, the\nindividuals with higher activity will have higher probability\nto be selected to reproduce offspring. The social interactions\namong individuals are generated by both inheritance and\nactivity-based preferential establishment, that is, the off-\nspring will inherit a part \u0001or all\u0002 of their parent\u2019s social in-\nteractions at birth, and when the individual becomes mature,\nif it has higher activity, it will have higher probability to\nestablish some new social interactions with other individuals.\nThus, with the evolution of the Penna model, it will create a\ncomplex network with evolution and aging, two common\nproperties observed in many real networks. Then we will\nstudy the properties of the network generated by the modi-\nfied Penna model from the point of view of complex network\ntheory.\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we try to\nmimic by computer simulation the evolution of population\nand the formation of social interactions in a society. Second,\nwe provide a network model with many important properties\nobserved in real networks, such as evolution, aging, small-\nworld effect, and the assortative mixing property.\nWe study the asexual Penna model in this paper. In the\nasexual version of the standard Penna model, each individual\nis represented by a bit-string of 32 bits \u000132 bits of 0 and 1\u0002,\nwhich contains the information of when a hereditary disease\nwill appear, and plays the role of a chronological genome.\nEach bit corresponds to a given age, and each individual can\nlive at most for 32 time steps \u0001\u201cyears\u201d\u0002. The presence of a\n1 bit at a given position means that the individual will suffer\nfrom the effects of a genetic disease in that and the following\nyears. The rules for the individual to stay alive are \u0001i\u0002 the age\nof the individual is less than or equal to 32; \u0001ii\u0002 the number\nof inherited diseases already taken into account at current\nage is lower than a threshold T; and \u0001iii\u0002 due to the restriction\nof space and food, at each time step, the individual will stay\nalive with probability V=1\u2212N\u0001t\u0002 \/Nmax \u0001the Verhulst factor\u0002,\nwhere Nmax is the maximum population size allowed by the\nenvironment and N\u0001t\u0002 is the current population size. There is\na minimum reproduction age R, after which the individual\n*Electronic address: cgli@uestc.edu.cn\n\u2020Electronic address: maini@maths.ox.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 045102\u0001R\u0002 \u00012005\u0002\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n1539-3755\/2005\/72\u00014\u0002\/045102\u00014\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society045102-1\ncan generate offspring. The genome of the offspring is a\ncopy of the parent\u2019s genome, with some random mutations.\nOn short timescales, nearly all mutations are bad, so only\ndeleterious mutation is considered: if a 0 bit is chosen in the\nparent\u2019s genome, it is mutated to 1 in the offspring genome,\nwhile if a 1 bit is chosen in the parent\u2019s genome, it stays 1 in\nthe offspring genome.\nThe Verhulst factor in the Penna model takes the idea\nfrom the population growth model introduced by Verhulst in\n1844. In that model, an environmental carrying capacity\nNmax is introduced and the growth rate of a population is\ngiven by\ndN\/dt = rN\u00011 \u2212 N\/Nmax\u0002 , \u00011\u0002\nwhere r is the intrinsic relative growth rate.\nHowever, the Verhulst factor for controlling the popula-\ntion size in the Penna model is too severe. Even if the popu-\nlation size is much smaller than the environmental carrying\ncapacity Nmax, this would predict that many individuals die\nin each year \u201cdue to the limit of space and food\u201d. The exist-\ning simulation results indicate that the population size is usu-\nally very small compared to Nmax \u0001in Ref. \u00037\u0004, the simulation\nresults show that the population size never even reaches\n0.3Nmax\u0002, and the individuals usually die at a very young age\n\u0001in Ref. \u00038\u0004, the simulation results show that almost all the\nindividuals die below the age of 20\u0002. These results are\nmainly \u201cdue to the restriction of space and food\u201d, although\nthere is \u0001more than\u0002 enough space and food. It should be\nnoted that some other researchers also argued that the Ver-\nhulst factor is too severe in the Penna model \u00039\u0004.\nIn fact, it seems from Eq. \u00011\u0002 that it is the population\ngrowth rate rather than the rate of individuals kept alive in\neach time step \u0001in the Penna model, it is the latter case\u0002 that\nis proportional to the Verhulst factor. Here we use a modified\nform of the Verhulst factor in the Penna model. We assume\nthat an individual will die only when its age reaches 32 or\nthe number of active diseases reaches the threshold T. We\nalso assume that in each year, the mature individuals will\nproduce int\u0006N\u00011\u2212N \/Nmax\u0002\u0007 offspring. It is easy to show that\nthe population size will approach, but never exceed, Nmax, if\nthe initial population size is N0\u0003Nmax.\nIn the standard Penna model, all the mature individuals\nhave the same probability to reproduce offspring. But, in\nfact, the reproductive activity is related to the individual\u2019s\nhealth condition and age. Usually when exceeding the mini-\nmum reproductive age, the young and healthy individual has\nhigher reproductive activity. In this paper, we use the follow-\ning function to express the dependence of activity on age:\nA1 = F\u0001a\u0002 = \b0, 0\u0004 a\u0004 R ,1 \u2212 exp\u0003\u0001a \u2212 32\u0002\/2\u0004 , R\u0003 a\u0003 32,\t \u00012\u0002\nwhere a is the age of an individual. We use the following\nfunction to express the dependence of activity on health:\nA2 = H\u0001m\u0002 = exp\u0001\u2212 m\/2\u0002, 0\u0003 m\u0004 T , \u00013\u0002\nwhere m is the number of active diseases at current age. We\nassume that the total activity depends on the product of A1\nand A2, that is, the higher the value of A=F\u0001a\u0002H\u0001m\u0002, the\nhigher the probability of the individual to be selected to re-\nproduce offspring. It should be noted that in Refs. \u00036,10\u0004, the\nauthors also considered the health-controlled birth rate in the\nPenna model.\nIf we consider social interactions among individuals in the\nPenna model, the individuals \u0001vertices\u0002 and the social inter-\nactions \u0001links\u0002 will form a complex network. We summarize\nthe evolution rules for the networks studied in this paper as\nfollows.\n\u0001i\u0002 Initialization. We start from N0\u00011\u0005N0\u0003Nmax\u0002 indi-\nviduals. Randomly, each individual has \u00031,T\u0004 diseases at ran-\ndomly selected positions in the bit-string and each individual\nis at the age in the range of \u00031,32\u0004. The individuals are ran-\ndomly interconnected with probability p1, where p1 satisfies\nthe inequality p1\u0006 ln\u0001N\u0002 \/ \u0001N\u22121\u0002, so that the resulting ran-\ndom network \u0001random graph\u0002 is fully connected \u000311\u0004. In the\nfollowing evolution, we assume that the connection density\nis approximately fixed, that is, the total links in the network\nare approximately equal to int\u0006p1N\u0001N\u22121\u0002 \/2\u0007.\n\u0001ii\u0002 Death. In each time step, the individuals with age\nlarger than 32 \u0001have reached the age 33\u0002 or with the number\nof active diseases having reached the threshold T will die,\nand the dead individuals and all the interactions connected to\nthem will be removed.\n\u0001iii\u0002 Creating new interactions. In each time step, we cre-\nate a small number of new social interactions among existing\nindividuals. We assume the number of newly created inter-\nactions is int\u0006p2\u0003N\u0001N\u22121\u0002\u0004\u0007 with p2 being a small probability.\nWhen choosing two existing individuals to which a new in-\nteraction is connected, we assume that two individuals are\nchosen from among all existing ones, with the probability\n\u0007\u0001i , j\u0002=AiAj \/ \u0001\nm,nAmAn\u0002, where Ai is the activity of indi-\nvidual i. That is, if two individuals both have high activities,\nthey will have a high probability of establishing a new social\ninteraction between them.\n\u0001iv\u0002 Birth. In each time step, the existing mature individu-\nals will reproduce int\u0006N\u00011\u2212N \/Nmax\u0002\u0007 offspring. We choose\nan individual to reproduce offspring with the probability\n\u0007\u0001i\u0002=Ai \/\n jAj. That is, the higher the activity of an indi-\nvidual, the higher is the probability to be selected to repro-\nduce offspring. This is the effect of activity-based preferen-\ntial reproduction. The offspring genome is a copy of the\nparent\u2019s one, and with probability p3 a deleterious mutation\nwill occur.\nAn offspring will establish an interaction with the parent,\nand each social interaction of the parent will be inherited\nwith probability 0.9 if the current total interactions L\n\b int\u0006p1N\u0001N\u22121\u0002 \/2\u0007, and with probability 1 if L\n\u0003 int\u0006p1N\u0001N\u22121\u0002 \/2\u0007.\nRemark 1. In rule \u0001ii\u0002, in principle, there is a possibility\nthat some individuals become isolated due to the removal of\nlinks. We assume that isolated individuals without any social\ninteractions cannot survive, so we simply remove these indi-\nviduals.\nRemark 2. Rule \u0001iii\u0002 is motivated by the observation that\nusually individuals with higher activity have more social ac-\ntivities, and thus have more opportunities to establish new\nsocial interactions with others. This is a kind of activity-\nbased preferential establishment of social interactions. If\nthere is already a link between two selected individuals, then\nwe will do nothing.\nC. LI AND P. K. MAINI PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 045102\u0001R\u0002 \u00012005\u0002\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n045102-2\nRemark 3. In our simulations, we found that if the off-\nspring inherit all the interactions of their parents, the popu-\nlation will evolve to an almost fully connected network, but\nif the offspring inherit each interaction with probability\nsmaller than 1, say 0.9, the number of interactions will de-\ncrease gradually. So, we design an adaptive inherited rule in\n\u0001iv\u0002 to make the total number of interactions approximately\nequal to int\u0006p1N\u0001N\u22121\u0002 \/2\u0007.\nThe above rules are illustrated by numerical simulations\nas follows. For a wide range of parameters, we can obtain\nsimilar results, and we present some representative results\nhere. We consider a network with parameters N0=1000,\nNmax=1000, R=8, T=4, p1=0.1, p2=0.0001, and p3=0.1.\nWe run the simulation several times, and show representative\nresults here. In principle, there is a probability that the re-\nsulting network becomes unconnected, but with these param-\neters this situation does not occur in our simulations. The\nabove rules are iterated 20000 times to reach a stationary\npopulation. In several independent runs, we found that the\nresulting networks always have 998 or 999 vertices, which\nare only slightly different from Nmax. In the following, we\nsometimes do not differentiate the resulting network size and\nNmax explicitly.\nWe next analyze some properties of the resulting network.\nWe first calculate the average path length \u0001APL\u0002 \u00032\u0004 of the\nnetwork. The APL is obtained by averaging the APLs of\nnetworks generated by 10 independent runs with the above\nparametric values \u0001in fact, the APLs are nearly identical in\neach run\u0002. The value of APL for the network is 2.0349,\nwhich is very small compared to the network size. For the\npurpose of comparison, we also computed the APL for net-\nworks with Nmax in the range \u0003100, 1000\u0004 \u0001other parameters\nare the same\u0002, and we found that the average path lengths are\nall small and decrease as the network size increases from 100\nto 1000 vertices \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004.\nThe evolution of the clustering coefficient \u00032\u0004 of the net-\nwork is plotted in Fig. 1\u0001b\u0002. We can see from this figure that\nthe clustering coefficient increases rapidly from a small value\n\u0001in the initial random network, the clustering coefficient is\napproximately equal to p1\u0002 to a large value, and the cluster-\ning coefficient fluctuates around about 0.45.\nAs we know, \u201csmall-world networks\u201d are characterized by\na high degree of clustering and a small average path length\nwhich scales logarithmically with the number of vertices \u00032\u0004.\nWe can see from the above analysis that the network has a\nlarge clustering coefficient and a small average path length,\nand the average path length decreases with increasing net-\nwork size, so the network is a small-world network.\nWe plot the degree distribution \u00032\u0004 of the resulting net-\nwork in Fig. 2. The distribution looks like a Poisson distri-\nbution, but it is \u201cfatter\u201d on the right-hand side of the peak\nthan on the left-hand side. In the above rules, the reproduc-\ntion of offspring can be seen as a kind of preferential attach-\nment in complex network theory \u0001the increase of new inter-\nactions is also a kind of preference\u0002. But the offspring\ngenome is mainly a copy of the parent\u2019s one: if the parent\nhas good health, the offspring will also have good health\n\u0001and high activity on becoming mature\u0002 with a high probabil-\nity, and this will increase the number of individuals with high\nactivity, so in the attachment the preferential effect will be\ndecreased and the random effect will be increased. Due to\nthe effect of mutation, the offspring who has a healthy parent\nwill lose good genome with a certain probability, which will\nalso increase the randomness of the attachment. So, the de-\ngree distribution should be a result of the combination of\npreferential attachment \u0001power-law distribution\u0002 and random\nattachment \u0001Poisson distribution\u0002. This explains the degree\ndistribution in Fig. 2. It is known that the distribution of\nmany real networks can also be seen as a combination of\npower-law and Poisson distributions.\nAssortative mixing is also an important property of many\nnetworks, especially social networks. A network is said to\nshow assortative mixing if the vertices in the network that\nhave many connections tend to be connected to other vertices\nwith many connections \u00035,12\u0004. Assortative mixing can have a\nprofound effect on the properties of a network. For example,\nFIG. 1. \u0001Color online\u0002 \u0001a\u0002 The network average path length\n\u0001APL\u0002 decreases as network size increases from 100 to 1000 verti-\nces. \u0001b\u0002 The evolution of the clustering coefficient.\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 The degree distribution.\nCOMPLEX NETWORKS GENERATED BY THE PENNA\u2026 PHYSICAL REVIEW E 72, 045102\u0001R\u0002 \u00012005\u0002\nRAPID COMMUNICATIONS\n045102-3\nit is found that assortative networks are more robust to re-\nmoval of their highest degree vertices than the disassortative\nones. To measure the assortative property of a network, we\ncan calculate the assortative coefficient. For mixing by ver-\ntex degree in an undirected network, the assortative coeffi-\ncient is \u00035,6\u0004\nr =\nM\u22121\n\ni\njiki \u2212 \u000bM\u22121\n\ni\n1\n2 \u0001ji + ki\u0002\f2\nM\u22121\n\ni\n1\n2 \u0001ji2 + ki2\u0002 \u2212 \u000bM\u22121\n\ni\n1\n2 \u0001ji + ki\u0002\f2\n, \u00014\u0002\nwhere ji ,ki are the degrees of the two vertices at the ends of\nthe ith edge, with i=1,2 , . . . ,M. The coefficient is in the\nrange \u22121\u0003r\u00031, and if r is positive, the network is assorta-\ntive.\nFor a network with Nmax=500 created by the above evo-\nlution rules \u000313\u0004, we calculate the value of r according to Eq.\n\u00014\u0002, and obtain that r=0.4952, which indicates strong assor-\ntative mixing in this network. The scatter plot of the degrees\nof pairs of vertices at the two ends of the links is shown in\nFig. 3\u0001a\u0002, and the histogram of the degree differences be-\ntween pairs of vertices at the two ends of the links is shown\nin Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002. From this figure, we see that the network shows\nassortative mixing. In fact, in the evolution of the population,\nthere are individuals removed in each time step, so the evo-\nlution of the network is robust to the removal of vertices\n\u0001including highest degree vertices\u0002, and has self-repair abil-\nity.\nIn summary, in this paper, we studied the evolution of a\nmodified Penna model, and showed that when taking the\nsocial interactions into account, the individuals form a com-\nplex network. The properties of the network were studied by\ncomputer simulation. Numerical results indicate that the net-\nwork has emergent small-world and assortative mixing prop-\nerties. The replication rule is responsible for the small world\neffect, and the Penna model is responsible for other proper-\nties, such as limited node number, aging effect, and the de-\ngree distribution, of the network. This paper, to some extent,\nmimics the evolution and the formation of social interactions\nin a society and also provides a network model with many\nproperties observed in real networks, such as evolution, ag-\ning, small-world effect, and assortative mixing property. We\nonly studied the asexual case of the Penna model in this\npaper; the sexual case, as well as other properties \u000314\u0004 and\ntheoretical analysis of the generated network, will be the\nsubject of future research.\n\u00031\u0004 T.
