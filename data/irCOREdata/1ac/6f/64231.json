In addition the spatial\nvariability of the tidally induced turbulent kinetic energy and associated mixing in the area are considered.

Tidal calculations show that there is significant small scale spatial\nvariability particularly in the higher harmonics of the internal tide in the region. In addition turbulence energy and mixing exhibit\nappreciable spatial variability in regions of rapidly changing topography, with increased mixing occurring above seamounts. Wind\neffects significantly change the distribution of the M2 internal tide and its higher harmonics, with appreciable differences found\nbetween up\u2013 and down\u2013welling winds, and long and short duration winds due to differences in mixing and the presence of wind\ninduced flows. The implications for model validation, particularly in terms of energy transfer to higher harmonics, and mixing are\nbriefly discussed.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nOver the last thirty years there has been significant\nprogress in computing tidal elevations and current pro-\nfiles in shallow sea regions under homogeneous conditions.\nInitial calculations were two dimensional and used coarse\nfinite difference grids which could not resolve near coastal\nregions. Consequently the main focus was on the M2 tide\n(Flather, 1976), rather than its higher harmonics that were\nproduced by non\u2013linear effects in shallow coastal regions.\nWith advances in computing power, finite difference grids\nwere refined and three dimensional models developed to\nexamine current structure (Davies and Kwong, 2000). Al-\nthough finite difference grids became progressively finer,\nthe majority of calculations were based on a uniform grid\nand hence resolution in nearshore regions was limited. To\navoid this problem boundary fitted coordinates were devel-\noped in order to improve resolution in nearshore regions.\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail address: phh@pol.ac.uk (P. Hall).\nAn alternative approach to the finite difference method\nwas to use finite elements (e.g. Walters and Werner (1989);\nWerner (1995); Walters (2005); Fortunato et al. (1997,\n1999); Heniche et al. (2000); Ip et al. (1998); Jones and\nDavies (2006)). In these models the element size could be\nvaried from coarse offshore to fine in nearshore regions.\nConsequently the generation of higher harmonics of the\ntide in nearshore regions could be accurately reproduced\nin large area models (Jones and Davies, 2007).\nWith increasing computing power three dimensional\nmodels have been developed, and horizontal finite differ-\nence grids refined. In shallow sea regions where tidal mixing\nis strong and the water column remains well mixed then\nstratification effects upon tidal turbulence are absent. Con-\nsequently although tidal currents over a region may have\nbeen collected at different times, the periodic nature of the\ntides means that in essence a synoptic data set can be pro-\nduced. In stratified regions, in particular those adjacent to\ntopography (e.g. Dogger Bank, Proctor and James 1996)\nwhere stratification changes, the determination of tidal\ncurrents and associated internal tides as the barotropic\nPostprint of article accepted for publication in Ocean Dynamics. 19 July 2007\ntide propagates over steep topography is more complex,\ndue to the time evolving nature of the stratification.\nEarly internal tidal models used primarily analytical\napproaches (Craig 1987; Sherwin and Taylor 1989, 1990)\nand were of cross\u2013sectional form. Subsequently three di-\nmensional models using uniform grids were developed\n(e.g. Cummins and Oey 1997) and used to examine the\ngeneration of the internal tide in a range of geographical\nlocations. These models showed the importance of along\nshelf topography, off shelf sea mounts (Xing and Davies\n1998, hereafter XD98, Xing and Davies 1999), and how\nthe shape of sea mounts and ridges influenced internal tide\npropagation.\nThe uniform nature of the grid resolution in these models\nmeant that the focus was the generation and propagation of\ntheM2 internal tide in three dimensions rather than a study\nof processes generating higher harmonics of the internal\ntide. Although recently a cross section high resolution finite\ndifference grid model was used to examine the generation of\nhigher harmonics of the tide in the proximity of sea mounts\n(Lamb, 2004).\nSo far the majority of internal tide calculations used\nuniform finite difference models, and considered the M2\ntide. However, the shallow sea applications of finite ele-\nment models, clearly shows that this approach is ideal in\na shelf edge environment where both enhanced resolution\nis required at the shelf edge and at offshore locations e.g.\nseamounts. Recently calculations of the M2 internal tide\nhave been performed using finite elements to examine its\ngeneration in shelf edge regions and the effect of element\nresolution e.g. Hall and Davies (2005a), (hereafter refer-\nenced as HD05a). This involved a comparison with a fine\nresolution (2.4 km across shelf and 4.6 km along shelf) fi-\nnite difference internal tide model, (XD 98), and calcula-\ntions with a range of finite element meshes to compute the\ninternal tide off the west coast of Scotland. The region cov-\nered by the model, namely the Malin\u2013Hebrides shelf, was\nidentical to that used by XD98, as were water depths, the\nopen boundary conditions and vertical stratification. By\nthis means a rigorous comparison was possible and the in-\nfluence of finite element resolution on the internal tide was\nassessed. A comparison with limitedmeasurements was also\npossible. Although the main features of the internal tide\ncomputed with the finite difference and fine finite element\nmodel were comparable, it was evident that the intensity\nof the M2 internal tide in its generation region and its sub-\nsequent propagation was improved by using the finer mesh\ngrid.\nIn this paper the work presented in HD05a is extended to\nexamine the spatial distribution of the shorter wavelength\nhigher harmonics of the internal tide in the Malin\u2013Hebrides\nshelf region. In addition, how these harmonics and stratifi-\ncation in the shelf edge region changes in response to wind\nforcing is considered. By using a range of wind conditions,\nsome insight as to the role meteorology has in modifying the\ninternal tidal signal in different regions can be determined.\nIn addition the results presented in HD05a, are extended\nto examine the spatial variability of higher tidal harmonics,\nnamely M4 and M6. As these are due to non\u2013linear effects,\nthey are a good guide as to how internal tidal models are\nrepresenting these processes. However, their short wave-\nlength and associated variability is a major challenge both\nin terms of grid resolution, and collecting high resolution\nsynoptic data sets for model validation. The importance of\nmixing in the lateral boundary layers of the ocean has been\nshown to have important consequences for the computed\ncirculation produced by large scale models (e.g. Samelson\n1998; Spall 2001). Since mixing is related to the breaking of\nsmall scale waves, then the energy transfer from theM2 tide\nto the shorter wave higher harmonics is important in this\nenergy transfer to mixing. However, as the present model\nis hydrostatic with a spatial resolution of order kilometres,\nthenmixing has to be parameterized using a turbulence clo-\nsure scheme. Here Mellor and Yamada (see Blumberg and\nMellor 1987 for detail) is used in the vertical and the scale\nselective filter of Smagorinsky (1963) in the horizontal. As\nshown in HD05a, as the finite element grid is reduced for\na specified filter parameter C in the Smagorinsky formula-\ntion, a Gibbs type oscillation occurs in the boundary layer\nclose to topography. To remove this the filter parameter\nC in the Smagorinsky formulation needs to be increased,\nthereby smoothing the boundary layer. In addition, the ex-\ntent to which wind induced mixing in the lateral bound-\nary layers influences internal tide generation, particularly\nthe higher harmonics and how this diffuses away from the\nlateral oceanic boundaries is very important. However, in\nterms of wind forced motion in boundary layers, as shown\nby Hall and Davies (2005c) (hereafter HD05b) it is neces-\nsary to choose an appropriate value of C in the Smagorin-\nsky form of sub\u2013grid scale parameterization in order to\nadequately represent the wind forced boundary layer on a\ngiven grid. The need to use sub\u2013grid scale parameteriza-\ntions of mixing in these models, which impact upon bound-\nary layer stability and thickness means that it is difficult to\nget a rigorous numerically converged solution in the sense\nthat the internal tide converges as the grid scale is reduced\ndue to the fact that the mixing changes in these boundary\nlayers and hence the density field in the region where the\ninternal tide is produced. For this reason the higher reso-\nlution grid and appropriate sub\u2013grid scale mixing as used\nby HD05a, in a successful simulation of the internal tide is\nused throughout.\nAn alternative approach would be to use a full three di-\nmensional non\u2013hydrostatic model on a very fine grid of\norder 10 m, with minimum fixed constant diffusion coef-\nficients, thereby avoiding the sub\u2013grid parameterization\nproblem. However, as shown by Berntsen et al. (2007) this\ndoes not guarantee convergence as the grid is refined unless\na scale selective filter and sub\u2013grid scale mixing parameter-\nization are included. In addition such a calculation would\nbe computationally prohibitive. These problems concerning\nmodel convergence and mixing parameterization suggest\nthat detailed internal tide turbulence measurements are re-\nquired in shelf edge regions. However, as shown later there\n2\nis significant spatial variability in these, both of which are\naffected by the wind, suggesting that large detailed synop-\ntic measurements are required for model validation. To the\nauthors knowledge this is the first time that the three di-\nmensional distribution of higher harmonics of the internal\ntides, associated turbulence intensities and the influence of\nwind effects upon them has been presented in a shelf edge\nregion.\nThe order of the paper is such that the region considered\nand model are discussed in the next section. Subsequent\nsections describe the three dimensional variability of the\nhigher harmonics of the internal tide. The response to wind\nforcing and the resulting changes in tidal distribution are\nconsidered later in the paper. Major findings and implica-\ntions for data collection to validate internal tidal models\nare summarized at the end.\n2. THE GEOGRAPHICAL REGION AND\nINTERNAL TIDAL MODEL.\nAs the full three\u2013dimensional equations and the turbu-\nlence closure model were presented in Xing and Davies 1997\n(hereafter XD97), they will not be repeated here, where\nonly the main features of the equations are discussed. The\nhydrostatic approximation is used in the model and den-\nsity is derived from temperature using the equation of state\ngiven in XD98. The model is forced by the barotropic tide\nintroduced through the open boundary (HD05a) and the\ninternal tide is generated as isotherms are moved over the\ntopography. The model is fully prognostic, with free surface\nelevation changing as the tide propagates on and off shelf.\nVertical mixing of momentum and density are parameter-\nized using vertical eddy viscosity and diffusivity coefficients\ncomputed using a turbulence energy closure, namelyMellor\nand Yamada sub\u2013model (e.g. Blumberg and Mellor 1987).\nAs the form of the turbulence model and similar models\nis given elsewhere (e.g. Luyten et al. 1996, XD98) it will\nnot be repeated here. As shown in HD05b the Smagorin-\nsky (1963) form of horizontal eddy viscosity used here is\nparticularly good at preventing the development of numer-\nical instabilities when wind forced internal waves are gen-\nerated on an irregular grid. However, as discussed previ-\nously and shown in (HD05a,b) the filter parameter C in the\nSmagorinsky formulation of viscosity must be chosen in an\nappropriate manner to match grid resolution in boundary\nlayers, and does influence the extent of these layers. The\nvalue and grid resolution used here is identical to HD05a,\nwhich yielded an accurate M2 internal tide.\nAs the short term modification of the internal tide due to\nwind forcing, rather than its seasonal variation are exam-\nined here, there is no applied surface heat flux. A surface\nboundary condition on momentum and turbulence of wind\nstress origin as in XD97, is applied at the sea surface with\na quadratic friction law as in XD98 at the seabed. Identi-\ncal barotropic tidal forcing to that used in the finite dif-\nference model (XD98) and finite element model (HD05a)\nwas applied. The model uses a sigma coordinate represen-\ntation in the vertical and 40 levels were used in the calcu-\nlations. Sigma levels were such that enhanced resolution in\nthe near\u2013bed and near surface region (as in XD98, HD05a)\nwhere the internal tide was largest, was used in all calcula-\ntions.\nThe finite element model (Fig. 1) is identical to that used\nby HD05a. The domain covers a range of water depths from\nthe order of 10 m close to the coast to the order of 3000 m\nin the ocean. Water depth changes rapidly at the shelf edge\n(approximately the 200 m contour), as it does along the\nedge of the Anton Dohrn Seamount and Hebrides Terrace\nSeamount. As shown in XD98 and HD05a, in these regions\nthere is appreciable internal tide generation. Detailed stud-\nies using a range of unstructured grid approaches (HD05b,\nHall and Davies 2005b) showed that it was necessary to\nhave a fine grid adjacent to the topography in order to ac-\ncurately reproduce wind forced internal waves generated in\nregions of topographic change. This was achieved using the\nfinite element grid (Fig. 2) found by HD05a to accurately\nreproduce the tide. By using the same mesh in the present\ncalculations a direct comparison with HD05a is possible,\nenabling the effect of the wind upon the M2 tide to be de-\ntermined.\nInitial conditions corresponded to a state of rest with zero\nelevation and current, with the same temperature profile\n(Fig. 3) as used by XD97, applied everywhere. This profile\nwas identical to that used in HD05a, enabling comparisons\nto be made with earlier calculations. Tidal barotropic forc-\ning at the M2 period was applied along the open bound-\nary and as found in HD05a, after 6 tidal cycles a periodic\nbarotropic tide and quasi\u2013periodic baroclinic tide were es-\ntablished, which was harmonically analysed. Since bound-\nary layer mixing occurred in the model and modified the\ndensity field through time, this had the effect of slightly\nchanging the baroclinic tide with time. Hence only a quasi\u2013\nbaroclinic tide was established. As HD05a, did not examine\nthe higher harmonics of the tide, in an initial calculation\n(Calc. 1, Table 1) these are computed in a tide only solu-\ntion and presented in detail. As discussed previously these\nare generated by non\u2013linear effects and hence the ability of\nthe model to reproduce them is a critical test of how it can\nhandle the cascade of energy to small scales. However as\nwe will show the short wavelength of these waves and their\nmodification by wind effects suggests that measurements\nto validate this aspect of the model will prove very difficult\nto make with a high level of accuracy.\nThe effect of wind forcing produced by a uniform steady\nwind upon the M2 tide and its harmonics was examined in\nlater calculations. A wind stress of 0.2Pa as used in XD97\nwas applied in these calculations. The generation of strong\ninertial oscillations which would persist in the solution and\nmask the steady wind induced response, was avoided by in-\ncreasing the wind stress with a sine wave form correspond-\ning to the first quarter of a sine curve (namely 0 to \u03c0\/2)\nfor 12 hours during the spin up period.\n3\nFig. 1.

TIDAL DISTRIBUTIONS\nAs considered in HD05a, barotropic tidal forcing pro-\nduces a strong baroclinic tide that is separated from the\ntotal solution by subtracting a barotropic tide computed\nby running the model in a homogeneous form (see HD05a\nfor detail). By this means changes in tidal current profile\nproduced by viscous effects that are significant in boundary\nlayers are removed from those due to internal pressure gra-\ndients, thereby leaving a true baroclinic signal. The alter-\nnative used in observational work of computing the baro-\nclinic tide by subtracting the depth mean current, does\nnot take account of viscous effects, and will not produce a\ntrue baroclinic profile in the boundary layer. This is dis-\ncussed later in connection with the M6 tide. By harmon-\nically analysing the resulting baroclinic tide, the residual\ncurrent and the M2, M4 and M6 components of the baro-\nclinic tide were determined. A similar approach was applied\nin the wind forced case. In a homogeneous tidal model, the\nresidual current, namely the tidal residual and the higher\nharmonics M4 and M6 are due to non\u2013linear effects. In the\nstratified case differential tidal mixing between shelf and\nshelf edge leads to a shelf edge front, with an across shelf\ndensity gradient. Associated with this density gradient is\nan along frontal flow in addition to any flow induced by\nwind forcing. However this aspect of the solution is beyond\nthe scope of the present paper.\nPrevious tidal calculations (XD97 and HD05a) showed\nthat the presence of topographic features such as the Anton\nDohrn offshore seamount at about 57.5\u25e6N (Fig. 1) influ-\nences the local distribution of the M2 internal tide. In ad-\ndition Lamb (2004) showed that topographic features such\nas seamounts had an important role in generating higher\nharmonics. For these reasons we will initially examine the\ndistribution of the M2 tide and its higher harmonics in this\narea. To be consistent with HD05a, the same cross sections\nnamely D1n, D1c and D1s (Fig. 1) are considered to deter-\nmine the spatial distribution of the higher harmonics. How-\never since the M2 baroclinic tidal distribution at all cross\nsections was examined in HD05a, this component will only\nbe considered in detail at cross section D1n.\nConsidering initially the M2 baroclinic tidal current at\ncross section D1n. It is evident from Fig. 4 that on the shelf\na surface and bottom intensification of M2 baroclinic cur-\nrent amplitude which is indicative of a first mode internal\nwave is evident although higher modes with reduced am-\nplitude also occur. A bottom intensification of the internal\ntide at the shelf break, extending down the slope is also\napparent. These regions of internal tide generation are as-\nsociated with areas of critical slope, where the shelf slope\n\u2202h\/\u2202x matches the internal wave slope S, given by S2 =\n(\u03c92\u2212f2)\/(N2\u2212\u03c92) with \u03c9 the M2 tidal frequency, f Cori-\nolis and N buoyancy frequencies, and an enhanced inter-\nnal tide is generated (see Vlasenko et al. 2005, for details).\nObviously in the model the topography and hence \u2202h\/\u2202x\nvaries down the slope. Also due to bottom boundary layer\nmixing N varies from its initial value in a complex manner\ndepending upon local tidal turbulence intensity (see later)\nwhich depends upon both barotropic and baroclinic bot-\ntom currents. These changes in \u2202h\/\u2202x and S exhibit sig-\nnificant small scale variability and hence appreciable local\nchanges in internal tide intensity occur. In addition there is\ninternal tide propagation from the Anton Dohrn seamount\nonto the shelf slope (see below and XD96). Comparison at\nother cross sections (not presented) did however show that\nthe extent of this downslope region of intensified bottom\ncurrent varied from section to section in the region of the\nseamount. This is to be expected since \u2202h\/\u2202x shows signifi-\ncant variability in the seamount region, and bottom turbu-\nlence and hence N changes over relatively small distances\n(see later).\nThe variation in the magnitude of the M2 internal tide\nover small horizontal distances (see separation of cross sec-\ntions D1n, D1c, D1s in Fig. 2) in the Anton Dohrn region is\nbecause both super\u2013critical and sub\u2013critical internal tides\nare generated along the shelf slope and on the seamount\nsides, producing internal tides that propagate both onto the\nshelf and into the ocean (see XD96 for detail). As shown in\nXD96 the exact location and topography of the seamount\nwas responsible for the offshelf distribution of the internal\ntide. Further to the south of the seamount (see cross section\nC2), where the slope is steeper, the region of maximum M2\ninternal tide occurs down the slope in deeper water (not\nshown). In the shelf break region, a surface intensification\noccurs, with a slight increase on the shelf at depth, suggest-\ning that there is little on shelf propagation of the internal\ntide at cross section C2.\nContours of the u current amplitude at the M4 frequency\nin the Anton Dohrn region show (Figs. 5a\u2013c), an intensi-\nfication at depth along the eastern side of the seamount\nat cross section D1n (Fig. 5a). This location corresponds\nto the area of strong M2 baroclinic tidal currents (Fig. 4),\nwhich show significant spatial variability. Consequently the\nnon\u2013linear momentum advection terms which transfer en-\nergy to higher harmonics are a maximum in this region and\ngive rise to this strong M4 signal. Similarly a local increase\nin M4 tidal current is apparent at the sea surface and sea\nbed to the east of the seamount and near the shelf break\nwhere there is an appreciable lateral gradient in the M2\ntidal current (Fig. 4). Besides the non\u2013linear momentum\nadvection terms, other terms such as time varying eddy vis-\ncosity (Davies and Lawrence 1994) can give rise to higher\nharmonics of the tide, although these were appreciably less.\nIn addition quadratic friction can generate higher harmon-\n6\nics, although this is the M6 rather than M4 component (see\nlater).\nAt cross section D1c the region of maximum M4 current\namplitude is located on the western side of the seamount\n(Fig. 5b) in the region of significant gradients in the M2\nbaroclinic tidal current (not shown but see HD05a). A\nweaker signal is evident (Fig. 5b) on the eastern side due\nto the reduced intensity of the M2 tide in this region com-\npared to previously (Fig. 4). A mid\u2013water M4 maximum\ncurrent is apparent at the top of the shelf slope (Fig. 5b)\ncorresponding to a region of rapid M2 tidal current varia-\ntion.\nAt the southern edge of the seamount (cross section D1s)\nthere is a local enhancement of the M4 tidal current on\neither side of the seamount and in the shelf break region\n(Fig. 5c). These areas correspond to regions of enhancedM2\nu\u2013current amplitude (not shown but see HD05a). At cross\nsection C2, there is a small (of order 3 cm s\u22121) M4 tidal\ncurrent amplitude at the shelf break and along the shelf\nslope (not shown) in regions where the M2 tidal current is\nsignificant.\nThe distribution of the M6 tidal current amplitude along\ncross section D1n (Fig. 6) is comparable to that for the M4\ntide (Fig. 5a), although its amplitude is about half that of\nthe M4 tide (compare Figs. 5a and 6). Similarly at the other\ncross sections (not shown) the spatial distribution of the\nM6 tide is comparable to that for M4, although its ampli-\ntude is about half. This suggests that it is non\u2013linear inter-\naction in regions where the M2 internal tide is largest and\nhas a strong spatial variability (significant gradient) that is\nresponsible for the generation of higher harmonics. Away\nfrom the near bed region the non\u2013linear momentum advec-\ntion terms which transfer energy from the M2 to M4, also\nmove energy to theM6 tide. However, in the near bed region\nthe quadratic friction term is the dominant mechanism and\nmoves energy from the M2 to M6 frequency. By generating\nan M6 baroclinic tide by removing the barotropic compo-\nnent using a homogeneous calculation from the total tide\nit is possible to isolate the M6 baroclinic tide. The alterna-\ntive that would have to be used in the case of observational\ndata would be to subtract a depth mean M6 tidal current\nfrom the total, which would clearly only partially remove\nthe barotropic M6 tide. Consequently a rigorous validation\nof the M6 component against observations would be very\ndifficult. In addition since M6 is generated in the nearbed\nregion through bed friction and turbulence, detailed mea-\nsurements of bed roughness and thickness of the turbulent\nbottom boundary layer would be required (see later).\nAs the internal tide upwells and downwells over the steep\ntopography tidal mixing occurs and this influences the tem-\nperature field. Although the extent of the displacement of\nthe temperature surfaces varies with depth below the sur-\nface, it is useful to examine its spatial variability at a given\ndepth. To this end the model was run for a significantly\nlonger period of time (namely 20 tidal cycles ) to allow\ntidal mixing and tidally produced turbulent kinetic energy\n(t.k.e.) to become established. In essence tidal mixing in\nthe bottom boundary layer changes the temperature field\nfrom its initial prescribed value to one which is consistent\nwith the internal tidal distribution and the turbulent Ek-\nman lower layer.\nAway from the Anton Dohrn Seamount and the shelf\nedge region a near uniform spatial distribution of temper-\nature was found at 600 m (Fig. 7a). Since this depth is\nabove the top of the seamount, the reduction in temper-\nature is associated with enhanced vertical mixing above\nthe seamount (see later). Enhanced up\u2013welling and verti-\ncal mixing at the shelf edge region to the north of 57\u25e6N\nleads to regions of cold water, the across shelf extent of\nwhich varies with position (Fig. 7(a)). It is evident from\nFig. 7a that it is largest in the region to the north\u2013east of\nthe seamount where XD96 showed there is a significant M2\ntidal energy flux both along and across the depth contours.\nIn the region of cross section C2 there appears to be a re-\ngion of slightly warmer shelf edge water at 600 m depth.\nAs the shelf slope is different at this location compared to\ncross sections D1 this gives rise to a maximum internal tidal\ncurrent at about 1200 m depth rather than higher up the\nslope (of order 600 m) found farther north. Differences in\nlocation at depth of maximum internal tidal current gen-\neration will produce differences in boundary layer mixing\nthat will influence the temperature distribution. Although\na detailed study of this is beyond the scope of this paper\nwe will briefly consider the spatial variability of t.k.e.\nAt a depth of 1200 m there is more horizontal spatial\nvariability in the temperature field (not shown), associ-\nated with small scale variations in mixing due to spatial\nchanges in tidally produced turbulence. Contours of log10\nt.k.e. along the shelf slope show (Fig. 7(b)) significant spa-\ntial variability. To be consistent with the temperature dis-\ntribution plot, these contours correspond to a depth of 1200\nm below the surface, rather than a height above the sea\nbed that is more appropriate in the case of bed generated\nturbulence. Since it is not possible, due to the highly non\u2013\nlinear nature of the processes producing t.k.e. to partition\nit into a barotropic and baroclinic part, these contours rep-\nresent total turbulent kinetic energy. A major source of this\non the upper part of the shelf slope region is due to the\nbarotropic tide.\nHowever, as shown by Xing and Davies (1996a,b) at\ndepth, along shelf slopes it is a maximum in nearbed re-\ngions where the internal tide is generated. The strong max-\nimum at 1200 m, in the shelf edge region (Fig. 7b) at the\nlocation of strong internal tides at cross section C2 shows\nthat this is associated with the internal tide production in\nthis area, at this depth. As discussed above internal tide\nproduction was evident in the across slope distribution of\nu\u2013current amplitude at this depth. The significant spatial\ndistribution of t.k.e. along the shelf slope region, shown in\nFig. 7(b), illustrates that there will be appreciable variation\nin turbulence intensity measurements from one transect to\nanother. In addition a high resolution model mesh resolu-\ntion both across and along the shelf slope is required. Ap-\npreciable small scale variations in t.k.e. are evident around\n7\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 2 4 6 8 1\n0\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n6\n1\n8\n2\n0\n2\n2\n2\n4\n2\n6\n2\n8\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFig. 4.

A similar feature is just evident\non top of the Hebrides Terrace Seamount (Fig. 7b).\nTo examine the depth and lateral variation of t.k.e. in\nmore detail, cross section plots of log10 t.k.e. were com-\nputed along cross sections D1n, D1c, D1s (Figs. 8a to 8c)\nand C2, at the time corresponding to the internal tide con-\ntours shown previously. Contours of t.k.e. at cross section\nD1n, exhibit (Fig. 8a) enhanced turbulence in the near bed\nregion, particularly at the shelf break and at depth along\nthe eastern edge of the seamount where internal tide gen-\neration is a maximum (Fig. 4a). At cross section D1c the\nregion of maximum t.k.e. is situated at depth on the west\nside of the seamount (Fig. 8b) in the region of strong M2\ninternal tide production. A region of intensified turbulence\nis evident at the shelf break with patches of intensified tur-\nbulence down the shelf slope in areas corresponding to in-\nternal tide generation. Similar patches of intensified tur-\nbulence occur on both the western and eastern side of the\nseamount and along the shelf slope at cross section D1s\n(Fig. 8c) in regions of enhanced internal tide. At cross sec-\ntion C2, where the internal tide at the shelf break is small\nnear bed t.k.e. (not shown) is small and of limited lateral\nextent.\nThe effect of increased turbulence energy in these regions\nis to enhance nearbed mixing thereby reducing the buoy-\nancy suppression of turbulence in the nearbed region. A\nconsequence of this is that in some areas near bed turbu-\nlence increases with time. This time increase was found to\nbe particularly large and extend away from the near bed at\ncross sections D1s and C2. A comparison of the time vari-\nation of t.k.e. at cross section D1s (not presented) shows\nthat the intensity and lateral extent of turbulent energy\nalong the seamount slope and in the shelf edge region where\nthe internal tide is a maximum rapidly grows with time.\nSimilarly at cross section C2 (not shown) there is a rapid\nincrease at a depth of 1200 m, associated with the strong\ninternal tide in this region. As discussed previously in con-\nnection with Fig. 7b, at this depth themaximum turbulence\nenergy in the shelf edge region occurs at cross section C2.\nThe fact that these regions of maximum t.k.e. occur at lo-\ncations of maximum internal tidal current amplitude shows\nthat in the shelf slope region there will be other maxima\nat different positions and depths. Consequently in the shelf\nslope region there will be considerable small scale variation\nin the location of strong t.k.e. regions. This clearly shows\nthat any measurement strategy aimed at determining tur-\nbulence energy data sets for model validation will require\nhigh resolution sampling.\n8\n(a)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n3\n1\n4\n1\n5\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n(b)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n1\n3\n1\n4\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n(c)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFig. 5.

Wind towards the north (a down\u2013welling favourable\nwind)\nIn order to determine the influence of wind effects upon\nthe internal tide, calculations were performed with winds\nof short and long duration towards the north (Calcs 2 and\n3) and the south (Calcs 4 and 5). A summary of the cal-\nculations is given in Table 1. After the initial ramping up\nperiod a fixed time and space invariant wind stress of 0.2Pa\nwas used in all calculations, with open boundary barotropic\ntidal forcing as in Calc. 1.\nThe effect of short term wind forcing was enhanced mix-\ning in the surface layer with an associated weakening of the\nthermocline in the near surface (of order 100 m) layer. How-\never below this layer there was little change in the tidally\naveraged (over an M2 tidal cycle) temperature field.\nTo determine the effect of wind upon tidal u\u2013current am-\nplitude along cross section D1n, differences in amplitude\nwith and without wind forcing were computed for each con-\nstituent (Figs. 9a\u2013c). Contours of this difference for the M2\ninternal tide away from the shelf show (Fig. 9a) that the\nchange in the M2 internal tide is mainly restricted to the\nsurface layer where the temperature and hence density field\nhas been changed by the wind. The largest effect occurs\nin the surface layer above the seamount where the current\ndue to the internal tide was a maximum (Fig. 4). On the\nshelf besides changes in the M2 internal tide at the surface\nthere are some changes at depth. This is due to enhanced\nmixing arising from an increase in bottom turbulence due\nto wind induced bottom currents in shallow water. On av-\nerage these changes were of the order of 5 cm s\u22121, (Fig.\n9a) compared with the M2 internal tidal current amplitude\n(Fig. 4) of order above 20 cm s\u22121. Namely a change of over\n20%. Changes in the u\u2013current amplitude of the M2 inter-\nnal tide at other cross sections was not appreciably differ-\nent to that shown in Fig. 9a.\nFor the M4 component, the most significant modifica-\ntions (Fig. 9b) occur in the surface layer particularly in the\nshelf break region where the M2 tidal current (Fig. 4) is\n9\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n.0 .5 1.0\n1\n.5\n2\n.0\n2\n.5\n3\n.0\n3\n.5\n4\n.0\n4\n.5\n5\n.0\n5\n.5\n6\n.0\n6\n.5\n7\n.0\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFig. 6. As Fig. 4 but for the M6 harmonic at cross section D1n.\nlargest. As discussed previously the M4 is produced by the\nnon\u2013linear interaction of the M2 tide with itself. Conse-\nquently changes in M4 will be largest in regions where the\nlargest changes occur in M2, namely the surface layer. Typ-\nically the changes in M4 are only of the order of 1 cm s\n\u22121\n(Fig. 9b), although this is significant in the surface layer\nwhere the M4 tidal current is only about 3 cm s\n\u22121 (Fig. 5a).\nAt depth, along the eastern side of the seamount, the M4\nchanges by about 1.4 cm s\u22121. In this area, the M4 current is\nappreciable (up to 14 cm s\u22121) (Fig. 5a), and this change re-\nflects the small shift in M2 tidal current maximum at depth\n(Fig. 4) in this region due to the small difference in temper-\nature field produced by the wind. At other cross sections\n(not shown) comparable changes to the M4 tidal current\namplitude occur in the surface layer, with small changes at\ndepth in regions where the M4 tidal current is a maximum.\nThe wind induced difference in theM6 tidal current along\ncross section D1n (Fig. 9c) shows a comparable distribu-\ntion in the surface layer to that computed for M4, although\nwith a significant (of order 50%) reduction in magnitude.\nSimilarly at depth the region of change corresponds to that\nfound for the M4 tidal current (compare Figs. 9b and c). A\nstudy of the M6 tide shows that in this region the M6 arises\nfrom M4 and M2 interaction, with these changes reflecting\ndifferences in the M2 distribution. As for M4, at other cross\nsections (not shown), the M6 changes in the surface layer\nare comparable to those shown in Fig. 9c, with modifica-\ntions at depth occurring in regions where the M6 current is\na maximum.\nA consequence of applying a short duration wind forcing\nis that the major change in the density field only occurred\nin the surface layer. However, when a wind stress of 0.2\nPa was applied for 30 tidal cycles, XD97 found that there\nwas appreciable mixing along the shelf slope region which\naffected the generation and offshelf propagation of the in-\nternal tide. As shown in XD97 this influenced the M2 tide\nat depth. To examine this in more detail, the previous cal-\nculation was repeated with the wind applied for 20 tidal\ncycles (Calc. 3).\nThe result of applying the wind stress for a longer period\nis appreciably more mixing in shallow water than found\nin the tide only calculation together with a weakening of\nthe surface thermocline (Fig. 10a) compared to the short\nwind period calculation. It is evident from Fig. 10a, that at\ndepth, particularly in the regions adjacent to the sea bed,\nenhanced mixing has changed the local density gradient.\nThis is in part due to the wind field, but tidal mixing also\ncontributed to the mixing at depth in slope regions, due to\nthe extended time integration.\nContours of the time averaged (over a tidal cycle) dif-\nferences in the temperature distribution at 200 m between\nthat with tide and wind and tide alone are given in Fig. 10b.\n10\n(a)\nLongitude12\u00b0W 11\u00b0W 9\u00b0W 8\u00b0W\nLa\ntit\nud\ne\n55\u00b0N\n56\u00b0N\n58\u00b0N\n59\u00b0N\n6\n.7\n6\n.8\n6\n.9\n7\n.0\n7\n.1\n7\n.2\n7\n.3\n7\n.4\n7\n.5\n7\n.6\n7\n.7\n7\n.8\n7\n.9\n8\n.0\n8\n.1\n8\n.2\n8\n.3\n8\n.4\n8\n.5\n8\n.6\nFig. 7.

Cross sections of log10 t.k.e. (m2 s\u22122) at cross sections (a) D1n, (b) D1c, (c) D1s from a short tidal integration.\nIn the case of a downwelling favourable wind, in a coastal\nregion, and as found by XD97 at the shelf edge warm sur-\nface water downwells to depth and gives rise to an increase\nin temperature. Some shelf edge regions of increased tem-\nperature at depth are clearly evident in Fig. 10b, although\nelsewhere the temperature is reduced. In the deep ocean,\nas expected there is little change in temperature. The exis-\ntence of patches of increased\/decreased temperature in the\nshelf edge region shows that the three dimensional temper-\nature response to wind forcing is more complex than that\nfound by XD97 in a cross\u2013sectional model. In three dimen-\nsions the internal tide can propagate both across and along\nthe shelf edge. In addition the vertical velocity associated\nwith the wind induced flow is more complex than in a cross\u2013\nsectional model. This leads to greater spatial variability in\nthe internal tidal signal and the associated mixing of tidal\nand wind origin. In addition alongshelf flows of wind origin\ncan advect water from one region of tidal mixing to another.\nA process that is not included in a cross\u2013sectional model.\nAs in the short wind period calculation, contours of the\ndifference in u\u2013current amplitude along cross section D1n\nfor the M2, M4 and M6 components were determined. For\nthe M2 tide it is evident (Fig. 11a) that there is no substan-\ntial change on the shelf. However an appreciable change in\nM2 baroclinic tidal current amplitude (Fig. 11a) has oc-\ncurred in the surface layer above the shelf break and at the\ntop of the shelf slope associated with the change in stratifi-\ncation. In addition, near the foot of the slope an appreciable\nM2 internal tide is produced (Fig. 11a) associated with the\nchange in stratification. Also a strong internal tide was pro-\nduced along the western side of the seamount (Fig. 11a) a\nregion where previously (Fig. 4) there was no internal tidal\nsignal. The reason for the appearance of the internal tide in\nthese areas is due to a local change in stratification arising\nfrom prolonged tidal and wind induced mixing. Compara-\nble changes in the stratification at depth, at other cross\nsections D1c and D1s (not shown) gave similar changes.\nThe modification of the M2 internal tide gives rise to a\nsimilar pattern of change in the M4 component (Fig. 11b).\nHowever the magnitude of the change (Fig. 11b) is small (of\norder up to a maximum of 2.5 cm s\u22121). As in the short du-\nration wind case (Calc. 2, Table 1) there is an appreciable\nchange in the M4 near surface tidal current amplitude due\nto wind mixing in the surface layer affecting the M2 tide.\nIn addition there is a small M4 tidal signal at depth along\nthe shelf slope and on the western side of the seamount in\n13\n(a)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n(b)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n.0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0\n1\n.2\n1\n.4\n1\n.6\n1\n.8\n2\n.0\n2\n.2\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n(c)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0\n.0\n0\n.1\n0\n.2\n0\n.3\n0\n.4\n0\n.5\n0\n.6\n0\n.7\n0\n.8\n0\n.9\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFig. 9.

Similar large scale changes in\nthe M4 current amplitude occurred at other cross sections\n(not shown). Although the large scale distribution was sim-\nilar, the exact location and magnitude varied between cross\nsections due to differences in topography and mixing.\nAs in the short duration calculation, the largest wind\ninduced modification of the M6 tidal current arises in the\nsurface layer (Fig. 11c). At depth the largest change occurs\nin the slope region where the modification of the M2 and\nM4 tide has been greatest. As considered previously this\nshows that M6 is produced by the non\u2013linear interaction\nof M2 and M4 in these areas, although changes in bottom\nfriction due to changes in M2 will have an effect.\nAs shown in the short wind forced calculation, the intro-\nduction of a wind stress influences mixing and hence tur-\nbulence energy. How this is modified by the longer dura-\ntion wind was examined in terms of contours of t.k.e. from\ncross section D1n (Fig. 11d). To determine to what extent\nthe presence of a long (20 tidal cycle) wind stress of 0.2 Pa\ntowards the north has upon the turbulence energy distri-\nbution, contours of t.k.e. were plotted at the various cross\nsections (Fig. 11d). The presence of the surface wind stress\ngives rise to an enhanced layer of surface and on\u2013shelf tur-\nbulence at cross section D1n (Fig. 11d) that was not present\nin the tidal solution. In addition the distribution of t.k.e. in\nthe seamount and shelf slope region changes, due to wind\ninduced mixing, and corresponding changes in the density\nfield. This modification of the density field affects the lo-\ncation and intensity of the internal tide (Fig. 11a) giving\nrise to the differences that are evident between Figs. 11d\nand 8a. A detailed study (not presented) based on other\ncross sections shows similar changes in mixing and t.k.e.\ndistribution from one cross section to another. However,\nthe spatial variability of the mixing from one cross section\nto another appears to be enhanced by the presence of the\nwind. This series of calculations shows that the distribu-\ntion of the internal tide and its higher harmonics is modi-\nfied by a modest wind stress of 0.2 Pa. With short duration\nforcing this is confined primarily to the surface layer.

Wind towards the South (an up\u2013welling favourable\nwind)\nIn this section results are presented from calculations\nperformed with both a short duration (Calc. 4) and longer\nduration (Calc. 5) up\u2013welling favourable wind stresses of\n0.2 Pa. As previously temperature contours along various\ncross sections (not presented) show enhanced surface mix-\ning, comparable to those found in Calc. 2. Some slight dif-\nferences in the region of topographic slopes were evident\ndue to differences in mixing with an up\u2013welling wind com-\npared to down\u2013welling. The change in M2 tidal current am-\nplitude (Fig. 12) was not significantly different from that\nfound with the down\u2013welling wind (compare Figs. 9a and\n12) except for an increase in intensity and lateral extent\nin u surface current amplitude at about 10\u25e6W. This is due\nto changes in shelf slope stratification which influences the\ngeneration region and subsequent propagation of the M2\ninternal tide. Comparable changes to those shown in Fig.\n12 occurred at other cross sections. For the M4 and M6\ncomponents (not shown), the dominant features of the dis-\ntribution and magnitudes of the changes were not appre-\nciably different to those shown in Figs. 9b,c.\nAs to be expected there is appreciably more mixing in the\nslope regions, in the 10 day wind forced calculation (Calc.\n5). Calculations showed that wind forcing gives enhanced\nmixing in the slope region that subsequently spreads fur-\nther into the ocean. Consequently this change in density\ninfluences both internal tide generation and propagation.\nAs in the north wind case, contours of temperature change\nproduced by the presence of the wind (Fig. 10c), show sig-\nnificant spatial variability in the shelf edge region. As this\nwind direction is up\u2013welling favourable then a cross sec-\ntional model such as that of XD97 would give cooler water\nin the shelf edge region. Such regions are clearly evident in\nFig. 10c with the majority of regions where warming oc-\ncurred previously (Fig. 10b) replaced with cooler regions\n(Fig. 10c) due to the change in wind direction. As before\nthere is no significant change in the deep ocean. However\nat about 57.5\u25e6N in both wind cases, there is an increase\nin water temperature, which arises from enhanced verti-\ncal mixing of tidal and wind origin at this location. The\ndifferences in mixing and density advection due to change\nin wind direction explains why there are differences in the\nM2 internal tide under an up\u2013welling compared to down\u2013\nwelling favourable wind (compare Figs. 11a and 13a). For\nthe M4 component the modification due to the up\u2013welling\nwind shows (Fig. 13b) a larger change at depth and at a dif-\nferent position along the shelf slope than previously (Fig.\n15\n(b)\nFig. 10.

As Fig. 9 but for a long integration (Calc. 3) with tide and wind (0.2 Pa towards the North), for (a) M2, (b) M4 and (c) M6 tide\nwith (d) log10 t.k.e. (m2 s\u22122).\n11b). In addition the surface distribution and that on the\nwestern side of the seamount has been modified (Fig. 13b).\nAs discussed previously these changes arise due to the dif-\nferent distribution of the M2 tide computed with an up\u2013\nwelling rather than down\u2013welling favourable wind. Similar\nmodifications to the M4 tide were found at other cross sec-\ntions.\nThe dominant features of the distribution of the change\nin M6 u\u2013current amplitude (Fig. 13c) are comparable to\nthose found with a down\u2013welling wind (Fig. 11c), and on\naverage are small, of the order of 0.5 cm s\u22121. Although the\nlarge scale features are the same, on the smaller scale there\nare some differences due to differences in the distributions of\nthe M2 and M4 tide. As discussed earlier the M6 tide arises\nprimarily from interaction between these components. At\nother cross sections the differences in tidal distribution are\ncomparable to those shown at cross section D1n.\nThe calculations presented here show that on the longer\ntime scale, wind effects substantially modify theM2 compo-\nnent of the internal tide and its higher harmonics. Also the\neffect upon the internal tide is different under up\u2013welling\ncompared to down\u2013welling wind forcing. Changes in the in-\nternal tide distribution arise not only in the surface layer\nbut at depth where the wind field has modified the density\nfield in the region of internal tide generation. In addition\nto changes in the M2 component, the higher harmonics are\nmodified to a different extent depending on wind direction.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nThe three dimensional calculations presented here, ex-\ntend earlier work (XD97) which used a simple cross sec-\ntional finite difference model to study the influence of\nthe wind. Such a slice model could not account for the\nalong\u2013shelf variation of topography, or for the presence of\nseamounts. In addition by using a proven finite element\nmodel (HD05a) with its ability to refine the grid in regions\nof rapid topographic change it is possible to resolve the\n18\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1\n0\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFig. 12.

As in HD05a,\nthe model was forced with the M2 barotropic tide. How-\never, unlike in that paper where the emphasis was on the\ninfluence of grid resolution upon the M2 tide and higher\nharmonics were not examined, here they are considered in\ndetail. In essence the focus of the tide only calculations\nwas an examination of the spatial distribution of the M4\nand M6 internal tide. Calculations showed that with re-\nalistic topography and viscous effects there was no well\ndefined point for the M2 tide generation or well defined\nbeams along which it propagated. This was rather different\nthan the isolated seamount results of Lamb (2004) who\nshowed narrow well defined beams for M2 propagation\nwith higher harmonics generated in regions where these\nbeams intersected. This could give rise to mid\u2013water gen-\neration of higher harmonics. The absence of narrow beams\nin the present calculations meant that higher harmonics\nwere a maximum in the shelf slope region or on either side\nof the seamount, where the M2 current and its horizontal\nderivative were a maximum. Similarly in the surface layer\nwhere the M2 internal tide was reflected giving rise to\nlocal patches of internal tide current, with an associated\nhorizontal gradient, regions of enhanced surface current\namplitude at the higher harmonics occurred.\nThe absence of narrow beams of tidal energy in the\npresent calculation is probably due to using realistic to-\npography and including viscous and diffusive effects. As\nshown by Vlasenko et al. (2005), higher vertical modes are\nvery rapidly damped when viscous and diffusive effects are\nincluded. This leads to appreciable broadening of the tidal\nbeams, and a reduction of interaction between them. The\napplication of realistic topography and an observed den-\nsity profile means that there is no longer a single source\nof internal tide generation as would occur with constant\nbuoyancy frequency and slope.\nCalculated turbulence energy distributions and associ-\natedmixing, show that a region of cooler water occurs above\nthe Anton Dohrn seamount. Such enhanced mixing above\nseamounts has been observed in a number of areas (e.g.\nKunze and Toole 1997).\nShort time scale calculations showed that the wind only\nmodified the near surface stratification, and the change to\nthe M2 internal tidal current and its higher harmonics was\nrestricted to the surface layer. Longer time scale calcula-\ntions showed that both the tide and wind modified the tem-\nperature field at depth, giving rise to a modification of the\ndensity field and a change in the distribution of the internal\ntide and its harmonics.\nOn the short time scale changes in the M2 internal\ntide and its higher harmonics produced with up\u2013welling\n19\n(a)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n0 2 4 6 8 1\n0\n1\n2\n1\n4\n1\n6\n1\n8\n2\n0\n2\n2\n2\n4\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n(b)\nLongitude\nD\nep\nth\n(m\n)\n11\u00b0W 10\u00b0W 9\u00b0W\n.0 .2 .4 .6 .8 1.0\n1\n.2\n1\n.4\n1\n.6\n1\n.8\n2\n.0\n2\n.2\n2\n.4\n2\n.6\n2\n.8\n3\n.0\n3\n.2\n3\n.4\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nFig. 13. As Fig. 9, but for a long duration wind (0.2 Pa towards the South) (Calc. 5), for (a) M2, (b) M4 and (c) M6 frequency.\nfavourable winds were comparable to those found with the\ndown\u2013welling favourable wind. This similarity is because\non the short time scale it is the mixing in the surface layer\nthat has the greatest effect and this is not significantly in-\nfluenced by wind direction. On the longer time scale there\nwas more mixing in the slope regions, the extent of which\ndepended on wind direction. Consequently the M2 internal\ntide and its higher harmonics together with boundary layer\nturbulence and mixing were changed substantially more.\nThe calculations presented here clearly show that\nchanges in the density field in regions of steep topography\nwill have an impact upon the spatial distribution of the M2\ninternal tide and its harmonics. In the present calculations\nthese changes were produced by wind forcing. However\nalong shelf flows of oceanic origin will also influence the\ndensity field in the region of internal tide generation. Ef-\nfects such as this together with meteorological forcing will\nlead to significant variability of the M2 internal tidal sig-\nnal. Consequently non\u2013linear interaction processes which\ngive rise to higher harmonics and a cascade to turbulence\nand mixing will be affected. This has implications in terms\nof trying to partially validate these non\u2013linear effects by\nseeing to what extent internal tidal models can reproduce\nthe energy transfer to higher harmonics. In addition it im-\npacts upon the spatial intensity required for data collection\nand model validation, using higher tidal harmonics. Simi-\nlarly the small scale variability of turbulent kinetic energy,\nsuggests that high spatial sampling is required to exam-\nine its distribution. Since its intensity is strongly related\nto the internal tide distribution in the bottom boundary\nlayer, which depends on local topography and stratifica-\ntion these also need to be measured in detail. The fact that\n20\nthe density field and hence the internal tide is modified\nby meteorological forcing suggests that it is important to\nobtain synoptic data sets for model validation. This is very\ndifferent to the barotropic case where a comprehensive\ndata set could be collected by sampling at different times.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors are indebted to Mrs L.
