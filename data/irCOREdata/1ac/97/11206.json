Khan, S. W. H. Cowley\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH, UK\nReceived: 11 December 1998 \/ Revised: 2 June 1999 \/Accepted: 9 June 1999\nAbstract. We have combined \u0018300 h of tristatic mea-\nsurements of the field-perpendicular F region iono-\nspheric flow measured overhead at Troms\u00f8 by the\nEISCAT UHF radar, with simultaneous IMP-8 mea-\nsurements of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) upstream of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, in\norder to examine the response time of the ionospheric\nflow to changes in the north-south component of the\nIMF (Bz). In calculating the flow response delay, the\ntime taken by field changes observed by the spacecraft to\nfirst e\u0080ect the ionosphere has been carefully estimated\nand subtracted from the response time. Two analysis\nmethods have been employed. In the first, the flow data\nwere divided into 2 h-intervals of magnetic local time\n(MLT) and cross-correlated with the \u2018\u2018half-wave recti-\nfier\u2019\u2019 function V2Bs, where V is the solar wind speed, and\nBs is equal to IMF Bz if the latter is negative, and is zero\notherwise. Response delays, determined from the time\nlag of the peak value of the cross-correlation coe\u0081cient,\nwere computed versus MLT for both the east-west and\nnorth-south components of flow. The combined data set\nsuggests minimum delays at \u00181400 MLT, with in-\ncreased response times on the nightside. For the 12-h\nsector centred on 1400 MLT, the weighted average\nresponse delay was found to be 1.3 \u008b 0.8 min, while for\nthe 12-h sector centred on 0200 MLT the weighted\naverage delay was found to increase to 8.8 \u008b 1.7 min.\nIn the second method we first inspected the IMF data\nfor sharp and enduring (at least \u00185 min) changes in\npolarity of the north-south component, and then exam-\nined concurrent EISCAT flow data to determine the\nonset time of the corresponding enhancement or decay\nof the flow. For the case in which the flow response was\ntimed from whichever of the flow components respond-\ned first, minimum response delays were again found at\n\u00181400 MLT, with average delays of 4.8 \u008b 0.5 min for\nthe 12-h sector centred on 1400 MLT, increasing to\n9.2 \u008b 0.8 min on the nightside. The response delay is\nthus found to be reasonably small at all local times,\nbut typically \u00186 min longer on the nightside compared\nwith the dayside. In order to make an estimate of the\nionospheric information propagation speed implied by\nthese results, we have fitted a simple theoretical curve to\nthe delay data which assumes that information concern-\ning the excitation and decay of flow propagates with\nconstant speed away from some point on the equator-\nward edge of the dayside open-closed field line boun-\ndary, taken to lie at 77\u00b0 magnetic latitude. For the\ncombined cross-correlation results the best-fit epicentre\nof information propagation was found to be at\n1400 MLT, with an information propagation phase\nspeed of 9.0 km s)1. For the combined event analysis,\nthe best-fit epicentre was also found to be located at\n1400 MLT, with a phase speed of 6.8 km s)1.\nKey words. Interplanetary physics (interplanetary\nmagnetic fields) \u00e1 Magnetospheric physics (Plasma\nconvection; solar wind \u2013 magnetosphere interactions)\n1 Introduction\nObservations of plasma convection in the high-latitude\nionosphere by polar-orbiting satellites have demonstrat-\ned that the form and magnitude of the flow depends on\nthe direction and strength of the interplanetary magnetic\nfield (IMF) which impinges on the dayside magneto-\npause boundary of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere (e.g.\nHeppner, 1972; Rei\u0080 et al., 1981; Rei\u0080 and Burch,\n1985).

The EISCAT radar location at 66.3\u00b0\nmagnetic latitude is marked by the dotted-dashed circle, (after Weimer,\n1995)\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1307\nthe Y component of the IMF; and (c) evidence of\nadditional dayside cells when the IMF points nearly\ndirectly northwards. Overall, such results provide con-\nvincing evidence that the primary process which couples\nsolar wind momentum to the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere-\nionosphere system is magnetic reconnection at the\nmagnetopause (Dungey, 1961; Cowley, 1981; Lock-\nwood, 1995).\nAlthough the studies cited define how the high-\nlatitude flow relates to the direction of the IMF, they\nprovide little evidence about the time scale on which\nthe flow reconfigures when the direction changes. The\nearliest information on this topic came from analyses\nof the response of ground magnetic disturbances to\nthe IMF. Using globally distributed magnetic records,\nNishida (1968) found that the DP 2 magnetic distur-\nbance was excited with a 7 \u008b 1 min delay at the pole\nand a 9 \u008b 5 min delay near the equator following the\narrival of southward-directed IMF at the bow shock.\nThe equivalent DP 2 current system is of twin-vortical\nform and is believed to represent the magnetic counter-\npart of the twin-vortex flow shown in Fig. 1. Since the\nonward time for changes in the IMF to propagate from\nthe bow shock to the dayside ionosphere is comparable\nto the delay measured by Nishida (1968), the implication\nis that the ionospheric flow response is very prompt\nindeed. Subsequent studies of magnetic disturbance\nconsidered the correlations between various interplane-\ntary parameters, such as the \u2018\u2018half-wave rectifier func-\ntion\u2019\u2019 of Burton et al. (1975) or the \u2018\u2018epsilon parameter\u2019\u2019\nof Perreault and Akasofu (1978), and geomagnetic\nindices such as the auroral electrojet indices (Baker\net al., 1981, 1983; Clauer et al., 1981; Bargatze et al.,\n1985). These studies indicated that two separate re-\nsponse times were present, with delays of 20 and 60 min\nrelative to interplanetary conditions mapped from an\nupstreammonitor to the subsolar magnetopause (though\nin making these estimates no account was taken either of\nthe slowing of the flow in the magnetosheath, or of the\nsubsequent Alfve\u00b4nic propagation to the ionosphere,\nwhich will shorten these times by \u001810 min). The shorter\nresponse delay was suggested to be associated with\nactivity driven directly by solar wind coupling at the\nmagnetopause, while the longer time scale was suggested\nto relate to eventual substorm activity on the nightside.\nTime scales of \u001820\u201330 min for the reconfiguration of\nthe twin-vortex flow as a whole following southward\nturns of the IMF have also been reported by Hairston\nand Heelis (1995) using ion flow measurements from\nDMSP spacecraft.\nGround-based radars have also been used to study\nthe ionospheric flow, and provide an ideal means of\nmonitoring its temporal variations in a given region.\nBy combining data from the EISCAT UHF radar\nwith IMF measurements made by the AMPTE-UKS\nand -IRM spacecraft, Etemadi et al. (1988) and Todd\net al. (1988) determined the response delay of the flow at\n71\u00b0\u201373\u00b0 magnetic latitude to variations in the north-\nsouth component of the IMF mapped to the subsolar\nmagnetopause. Observations were confined mainly to\nthe dayside ionosphere (08\u201319 MLT), and showed\nminimum delays of \u00185 min in the early afternoon\nsector, increasing to \u001810 min towards dawn and dusk.\nThese estimates should be reduced by \u00182 min if the\nAlfve\u00b4nic propagation time from the subsolar magneto-\npause to the ionosphere is taken into account. Similar\nvery short response delays on the dayside have also been\nreported in HF radar data by Ruohoniemi et al. (1993).\nThe increasing delays away from noon imply that the\nregion of enhanced flow expands rapidly away from the\nregion of the dayside cusp to earlier and later local\ntimes, and also, presumably, over the polar cap into the\nnightside. The dayside azimuthal phase speed at 71\u00b0\u201373\u00b0\nimplied by the results of Etemadi et al. (1988) and Todd\net al. (1988) is 5\u201310 km s)1. Direct measurements of the\ndayside phase speed at similar latitudes have also been\nmade using both radar data and ground-based magnetic\nrecords. Lockwood et al. (1986) and Lockwood et al.\n(1993) report values of 2.6 and 6 km s)1, respectively,\nusing EISCAT UHF and VHF radar data, while\nSaunders et al. (1992) derived a value of 5 km s)1 from\nCANOPUS magnetometer network data. Based on\nthese observations, Cowley and Lockwood (1992,\n1997) have suggested a theoretical picture in which flow\nchanges occurring in response to variations in the\ndirection of the IMF begin in the dayside cusp near\nnoon, and propagate away from this vicinity to establish\na new steady-state convection pattern over intervals of\n10\u201315 min. This expansion of the flow pattern corre-\nsponds to the ionospheric image of the expansion of the\nperturbed flow region at large distances in the magne-\ntosphere. For example, following a north-to-south\nturning of the IMF and the onset of open flux\nproduction at the dayside magnetopause, the perturbed\nregion will initially be confined to the dayside where the\nopen flux tubes are produced, followed by expansion\ninto the nightside as the open tubes are swept antisun-\nward by the magnetosheath flow and the disturbance\npropagates into the tail.\nOn the basis of this we may thus expect that the\ncomponent of the nightside flow which responds directly\nto the IMF should appear with a response delay of\n\u001810 min relative to first e\u0080ects in the cusp, this delay\ncorresponding to an expansion phase speed of\n\u00185 km s)1. To date, however, there have been very\nfew direct determinations of the nightside delay. Esti-\nmates from radar data obtained in a few case studies\nvary from \u001810 to \u001840 min (Lester et al., 1993; Taylor\net al., 1994). However, Ruohoniemi and Greenwald\n(1998) have recently presented an example using Super-\nDARN HF radar data in which changes in flow occur in\napparent response to a southward turn of the IMF\nwhich are essentially simultaneous (within \u00182 min) on\nboth the day and night sides at \u001875\u00b0\u201380\u00b0 latitude. In\naddition, Ridley et al. (1998, 1999) have interpreted flow\npatterns obtained using the AMIE modelling technique\nas indicating a coherent evolution of the flow pattern\nover the whole polar ionosphere with no significant\ndelays greater than \u00181 min between day and night\nsides. They determined that the flow change begins\n\u00188 \u008b 8 min after the corresponding IMF change\narrives at the subsolar magnetopause. However, the\n1308 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\ninterpretation of their data has been disputed by\nLockwood and Cowley (1999).\nIn this study our principal aim is to examine the\nresponse time of the ionospheric flow to the north-south\ncomponent of the IMF, and to determine its local time\ndependence. To this end we have used a large database\nof measurements of the ionospheric flow observed\noverhead at Troms\u00f8 by the EISCAT incoherent scatter\nradar, and have combined these with simultaneous\nmeasurements of the interplanetary parameters mea-\nsured upstream of the Earth by the IMP-8 spacecraft.\nThe next section provides details of the instrumentation\nand database, while cross-correlation and event analyses\nfollow in Sects. 3 and 4.\n2 Instrumentation and data sets\n2.1 The EISCAT CP-1-K experiment\nThe ionospheric flow measurements employed in this\nstudy were obtained by the tristatic EISCAT UHF\nincoherent scatter radar system using the CP-1-K\ncommon programme experiment, which has been run\ntypically on several days each year since 1993. In this\nexperiment the radar beam is pointed along the\nmagnetic field line at Troms\u00f8 (Norway), approximately\nsouthward at an elevation of 77.5\u00b0, while the remote site\nreceivers at Kiruna (Sweden) and Sodankyla\u00a8 (Finland)\nare pointed at a fixed intersection with the transmitter\nbeam at an F-region altitude of 278 km. This arrange-\nment allows continuous tristatic measurement of the\nplasma flow at a single point essentially overhead at\nTroms\u00f8. The data are integrated over 2 min intervals,\nwhich sets the limit on the time resolution of this study.\nThe CP-1-K tristatic observing point corresponds to\na magnetic latitude of 66.3\u00b0. This is a somewhat lower\nlatitude than those (\u001871\u00b0\u201373\u00b0) investigated in the\nprevious studies by Todd et al. (1988) and Etemadi\net al. (1988), which used beam-swung EISCAT data\nfrom the poleward-pointing \u2018\u2018Polar\u2019\u2019 experiment. Com-\nparison with the flow maps in Fig. 1 shows that on the\ndayside 66.3\u00b0 typically lies equatorward of the flow cells\nfor northward IMF, but just within their equatorward\nborder for southward IMF. On the nightside the\nEISCAT latitude lies on average in the equatorward\nborder of the flow cells for northward IMF, and well\nwithin the cells on closed field lines for southward IMF.\nThus the response of the flow to north-south changes in\nthe IMF should be observable in these data at all local\ntimes, a conclusion which is borne out by the data\nthemselves, as we will see later. The response time of the\nflow expected on the basis of previous results varies\nconsiderably between the prompt, few minute, responses\nobserved on the dayside by Etemadi et al. (1988), Todd\net al. (1988), and Ruohoniemi et al. (1993), and the\nmore extended intervals of 20\u201330 min which are prob-\nably more characteristic of reconfigurations of the flow\npattern as a whole reported by Hairston and Heelis\n(1995). On the nightside, Ridley et al. (1998) and\nRuohoniemi and Greenwald (1998) indicate flow re-\nsponses that are essentially simultaneous with the\ndayside flow, within 1\u20132 min or less, while other\nobservations cited suggest a slower propagation. If, for\nexample, flow changes propagate away from the open-\nclosed field line boundary at noon at phase speeds e.g. of\n\u00185\u201310 km s)1, the resulting delay at EISCAT should\nvary between \u00182\u20134 min at noon and \u00187\u201314 min at\nmidnight. The 2-min averaged flow data employed here\nshould thus be capable of distinguishing between these\npossibilities and of resolving day-night di\u0080erences of this\norder, though only just so for phase speeds at the top\nend of the range considered likely.\n2.2 IMP-8 interplanetary data\nFor purposes of this study the EISCAT radar data have\nbeen combined with observations of the IMF made\nupstream of the bow shock by the IMP-8 spacecraft.\nThis spacecraft moves in a near-circular 35 RE radius\norbit, and provides IMF vector data at 15 s resolution\nand solar wind plasma parameters with a resolution\nbetween 60 and 300 s. Since the flow response delays\nwhich we wish to measure lie typically in the range\n\u00185\u201320 min, as indicated, it is crucial to make a careful\nestimate of the propagation delay between fields ob-\nserved at the spacecraft and the arrival of their first\ne\u0080ects in the dayside ionosphere. Full details are\nprovided in the Appendix, but, briefly, the propagation\ndelay consists of three components. The first is the\npropagation time in the solar wind between arrival at\nthe spacecraft and arrival at the subsolar bow shock.\nThis has been calculated by using sharp changes in the\nIMF observed during particular intervals to determine\nthe orientation of the IMF \u2018\u2018phase fronts\u2019\u2019 in the\ninterplanetary medium, and hence the distance along\nthe Earth-Sun line to the subsolar bow shock of the\nphase front which passes through the spacecraft. The\nlatter distance is then divided by the observed velocity\nof the solar wind to give the propagation time to the\nsubsolar shock. This procedure is generally applied to\nseveral field discontinuities during a particular interval,\nfrom which a value is chosen which is representative\nof the interval as a whole. The second element is the\nfrozen-in transit time across the subsolar magneto-\nsheath. To estimate this we require models of the\nlocation of the subsolar bow shock and magnetopause,\nand the variation of the plasma speed between them.\nThe shock and magnetopause locations have been\nderived from the comprehensive empirical studies by\nPeredo et al. (1995) and Roelof and Sibeck (1993),\nrespectively, and we take a linear variation of the\nsubsolar flow from the value just downstream from the\nshock, determined from typical shock jump conditions,\nand a nominal 20 km s)1 reconnection-associated inflow\nat the magnetopause. The third element is the Alfve\u00b4nic\npropagation of the e\u0080ects of magnetopause processes\nalong newly-opened field lines to the cusp ionosphere.\nA constant propagation time of 2 min has been\nassumed, derived from the typical periods of fundamen-\ntal mode eigenoscillations of the high-latitude field lines.\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1309\nUsing these procedures, an IMF delay time representa-\ntive of 2-h intervals of radar data has been determined.\nTypical values lie in the range 5\u201315 min, with an\nestimated random uncertainty of about \u008b2 min and\nan estimated systematic uncertainty which is of the same\norder or less (see Appendix). This estimated propagation\ndelay is removed prior to averaging the interplanetary\ndata over the \u2018\u2018same\u2019\u2019 2 min intervals as the radar data.\nThese joint 2 min-averaged data sets form the basis of\nthe cross-correlation analyses presented in Sect. 3. The\nIMF propagation delays for the event analysis in Sect. 4\nwere determined in a similar manner, except that the\n\u2018\u2018phase front\u2019\u2019 for each IMF event was determined and\nemployed individually, and the solar wind parameters\nwere averaged locally in its vicinity (see Appendix).\n2.3 The combined data set\nThe database of EISCAT CP-1-K flow data and IMP-8\nsolar wind\/IMF data employed in this study, obtained\nduring the interval 1993\u201397, total about 300 simulta-\nneous hours. The data span all local times, though the\nhemisphere centred on dusk is favoured relative to the\nhemisphere centred on dawn. Typically \u00188 experiment-\ndays contribute data in each local time interval in the\ndawn hemisphere, compared with \u001813 experiment-days\nin the dusk hemisphere. An example of the data is\npresented in Fig. 2, where we show a 2-h interval\nspanning 0900\u20131100 UT on 14 February, 1996, corre-\nsponding to 1130\u20131330 MLT in the noon sector. The\ntop panel of the figure shows IMF Bz, while the centre\nand lower panels show the field-perpendicular iono-\nspheric flow velocity components, vN positive towards\nmagnetic north and vE positive towards magnetic east.\nThe results of Weimer (1995) reproduced in Fig. 1\nindicate that the flow should be small for IMF Bz\npositive, while westward and northward (\u2018\u2018dusk cell\u2019\u2019)\nflows should appear for IMF Bz negative. Correspond-\ningly, at the start of the interval when IMF Bz was\npositive, the observed flow scatters about zero. How-\never, two sharp southward turns of the IMF occurred,\nobserved at IMP-8 at 0925 and 1019 UT, which are\nmarked by the vertical dashed lines in the upper panel.\nThe first e\u0080ects in the ionosphere, determined from the\nindividual orientations of the field discontinuities con-\ncerned as indicated, are then expected at 0938 and 1032\nUT (the delay being 13 min in both cases), as indicated\nby the vertical dashed lines in the lower two panels. It\ncan be seen that both southward turns resulted in the\nexcitation of \u0018200\u2013300 m s)1 westward flows and less\ndistinct poleward flows, as expected, with first changes\noccurring at about 0941 and 1035 UT respectively, as\nmarked by the vertical dashed lines in the lower panel.\nThe response delays are thus about 3 min in each case,\nwithin an uncertainty band that is \u00182 min. The flow\nresponse is thus very prompt near noon, in conformity\nwith the previous results e.g. of Etemadi et al. (1988)\nand Todd et al. (1988). These authors reported a\n\u00185 min response delay in this local time sector, but\nthey did not subtract the \u00182 min magnetopause-to-\nionosphere propagation delay in the IMF signal which\nwe have included here.\nHaving now discussed the nature of the data, in the\nnext section we will present the results of a cross-\ncorrelation analysis between the ionospheric flow and\ninterplanetary parameters, which seeks to determine the\nflow response time scale at all local times. This study will\nFig. 2. Simultaneous IMP-8 magnet-\nic field data and EISCAT CP-1-K\nvelocity data for the interval 0900\u2013\n1100 UT (1130\u20131330 MLT) on 14\nFebruary, 1996.

Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nthen be supplemented in Sect. 4 with an analysis of\nindividual events such as those illustrated here.\n3 Cross-correlation analysis\nWe describe the results of a cross-correlation analysis\nbetween the 2 min-averaged EISCAT velocity data and\nthe similarly-averaged IMP-8 interplanetary data from\nwhich the propagation delay to the cusp ionosphere\nhas been removed, as described above. The radar data\nwere divided into overlapping 2-h intervals of MLT\n(MLT \u00bb UT + 2.5 h), and cross-correlations perform-\ned on both eastward and northward flow components\nseparately. The interplanetary parameter chosen for this\nanalysis was the \u2018\u2018half-wave rectifier\u2019\u2019 function V2Bs,\nwhere V is the solar wind speed, and Bs = Bz when the\nlatter is negative, while Bs = 0 when Bz is positive. In\ncommon with the results of the previous cross-correla-\ntion study by Etemadi et al. (1988), initial investigation\nindicated that this parameter produces correlation\ncoe\u0081cients which are generally as high or higher than\nother simple related interplanetary parameters. In\nparticular it produces higher correlations than related\nfunctions that use Bz directly, reflecting the fact that at\nthe latitude of Troms\u00f8 the flow is unresponsive to the\nIMF (and is generally small) when Bz is positive, but\ngrows in magnitude when Bz is negative, as we will\ndemonstrate in the results presented below.\nFor each 2-h MLT interval of radar data the cross-\ncorrelation coe\u0081cients of vE and vN with V\n2Bs were\ncalculated versus time lag over an interval of \u008b120 min,\nwith a resolution of 2 min (the resolution of the data\nsets). For positive lags the interplanetary medium leads\nthe ionosphere, while for negative lags the ionosphere\n(unphysically) leads the interplanetary medium. Before\npresenting the results, however, it is appropriate to\ncomment on the interpretation of the resulting cross-\ncorrelograms, particularly since it seems clear that the\nhigh-latitude flow varies in response to the IMF on\nmore than one time scale. The first time scale is the delay\ntime of the excitation and decay of the flow in response\nto north-south changes in the IMF, whose nature is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2 and in the previous studies\npresented e.g. by Todd et al. (1988). All previous\nevidence indicates that the delay times involved in this\nprocess are of order a few minutes relative to the arrival\nof first e\u0080ects, certainly in the dayside ionosphere. The\nsecond relates to changes in the local flow which are due\nto overall expansions or contractions in the flow pattern\nas the amount of open flux in the system changes. Such\nchanges take place on a significantly longer time scale.\nFor example, unbalanced dayside reconnection at rate\nof 100 kWb s)1 (corresponding to a transpolar voltage\nof 100 kV) will result in a uniform equatorward expan-\nsion of the open-closed field line boundary at a speed of\n\u0018200 m s)1. The time scale required for a given point in\nthe ionosphere to move significantly relative to the flow\npattern, corresponding to a boundary motion of a few\ndegrees of latitude, for example, is then of order several\ntens of minutes (about ten minutes per degree). We may\ntherefore envisage that as the IMF switches between\nnorth and south polarities the ionospheric flow will be\nsimilarly modulated with the short delay time scale,\nwhilst also undergoing variations on the longer time\nscale during each southward-directed IMF interval.\nWe may then ask at what delay time the peak in the\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cient will occur? The answer to\nthis question depends upon the nature of the flow\nvariation which is produced by the variation in the size\nof the flow cells on the longer time scales. If the change\nin the flow component relative to the (usually small)\npositive IMF Bz background has a consistent sense (e.g.\na consistently westward or eastward flow) whose absol-\nute magnitude may be modulated by the size of the flow\ncells, then it is easy to show that an extremum in the\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cient will occur at the lag corre-\nsponding to the flow excitation and decay delay time,\nirrespective of the nature of the long time-scale modu-\nlation. This can be seen from the fact that a maximum\n\u2018\u2018overlap\u2019\u2019 will invariably occur between the enhanced\nflow component and the IMF input function at this lag,\nsuch that a small shift in lag in either direction will\nreduce the \u2018\u2018overlap\u2019\u2019 and hence the cross-correlation\ncoe\u0081cient. Figure 1 shows that this is the situation\nwhich will prevail at EISCAT latitudes in most local\ntime sectors, since the radar will usually be located in the\nequatorward region of the flow cells where the flows will\ngenerally be consistently westward in the dusk cell and\nconsistently eastward in the dawn cell. However, there is\none local time sector where this general conclusion does\nnot apply, namely the pre-midnight Harang region. It\ncan be seen from Fig. 1 that in this region the flows will\ngenerally be westward for positive and small IMF Bz,\nwhile reversing to eastward for significantly negative\nIMF Bz. Typically then, if the direction of the IMF\nreverses from north to south, we may expect that the\ninitial flow excitation will be in the westward direction,\nreversing later to eastward on a time scale (a few tens\nof minutes) which may be dependent on the strength of\nthe southward field. In this case consideration of the\n\u2018\u2018overlap\u2019\u2019 between the flow component and the inter-\nplanetary input shows that a peak in the cross-correla-\ntion coe\u0081cient need not occur at the lag corresponding\nto the flow excitation and decay delay time as above, but\nmay occur at a later time characteristic of the reversal\nin the sense of the flow relative to the positive IMF Bz\n\u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019 value.\nThese qualitative conclusions are illustrated quanti-\ntatively in Fig. 3. We have constructed synthetic data\nsets consisting of 1000 simultaneous \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018ionospheric velocity\u2019\u2019 data points, corresponding to\n33.3 h of the 2-min averaged data employed here.\nA random number generator has then been used to\nselect the times of NIMF switches in the value of \u2018\u2018IMF\nBs\u2019\u2019, between zero, corresponding to northward IMF,\nand )1 nT, corresponding to southward IMF, or vice\nversa. A typical example is shown in the upper panel of\nFig. 3a, where NIMF = 75, such that the average time\nbetween \u2018\u2018IMF\u2019\u2019 switches is \u001826 min, corresponding to\n\u001813 data points. Two synthetic \u2018\u2018velocity\u2019\u2019 data sets are\nshown beneath. In the middle panel the velocity is taken\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1311\nto be a random number between 0 and )300 m s)1\nwhenever \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 is negative, and to be zero when\n\u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 is zero. This corresponds to the excitation of\na flow of variable magnitude, but consistent sense, in\nconcert with a southward IMF. The cross-correlation\nfunction between these data sets is shown in the upper\npanel of Fig. 3b, computed every two minutes over a\nrange of lags of \u008b120 min, with positive lags indicating\nthat the \u2018\u2018IMF\u2019\u2019 leads the \u2018\u2018velocity\u2019\u2019, as indicated.\nA single clear peak is obtained at zero lag, as anticipated\nin the discussion. The same result is obtained for all the\nsynthetic data sets of this nature which we have\ngenerated, having di\u0080erent random variations in the\ntimes of the IMF changes and in the velocity, and for\nvarious values of NIMF (between 50 and 100), as must be\nthe case. In the synthetic \u2018\u2018velocity\u2019\u2019 data shown in the\nbottom panel of Fig. 3a, however, the flow is switched\n\u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018o\u0080 \u2019\u2019 in concert with the \u2018\u2018IMF\u2019\u2019 function just\nas before, but now the flow may take positive or\nnegative values. Specifically, the flow is taken to be\nnegative (at a random value between 0 and )300 m s)1)\nfor 10 successive \u2018\u2018flow on\u2019\u2019 data points (i.e. 20 min of\nflow), after which it becomes positive (at a random value\nbetween 0 and +300 m s)1) for all subsequent \u2018\u2018flow on\u2019\u2019\ndata points, until such time as a \u2018\u2018substorm\u2019\u2019 takes place.\nAfter this time the flow reverts to negative for 10\nsuccessive points, followed by positive again until the\nnext \u2018\u2018substorm\u2019\u2019, etc. The times of NS \u2018\u2018substorms\u2019\u2019 are\nagain chosen randomly, and are indicated in the lower\npanel of Fig. 3a by the arrows, where we have chosen\nNS = 15 for the data set displayed (i.e. an average time\nof \u00182 h between \u2018\u2018substorms\u2019\u2019). This algorithm is\nintended in the simplest possible way to simulate\nconditions in the Harang region, where the flow\ndirection may change from west to east after a few tens\nof minutes of southward IMF due to polar cap\nexpansion (specifically 20 min in our algorithm), fol-\nlowed by the reappearance of westward flow when the\npolar cap subsequently contracts after a substorm. The\ncross-correlogram for this data set is shown in the lower\npanel of Fig. 3b. Here the cross-correlation values are\nlower than before, and peak at a lag of 20 min,\ncorresponding to the time scale of the switch in the\nsense of the flow. While such results are typical, we find\nthat other randomly-chosen data sets having the same\nbasic parameters (i.e. the same NIMF and NS values) can\nproduce peaks at various lags between \u00180 and \u001820 min.\nWhen examining the cross-correlation results, there-\nfore, attention must be paid to the nature of the flow\nresponse to IMF Bz. If the flow response is in a\nFig. 3. a Synthetic data sets of 1000 2-min \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 values (upper\npanel) and simultaneous \u2018\u2018ionospheric velocity\u2019\u2019 components deter-\nmined from two di\u0080erent algorithms (lower two panels). In the upper\npanel, \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 is switched between zero and )1 nT (or vice versa) at\n75 randomly chosen times. In the middle panel the \u2018\u2018velocity\u2019\u2019 is\nswitched \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018o\u0080\u2019\u2019 in concert with \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019, and is allowed to\nhave a randomly-chosen negative value between 0 and )300 m s)1\nwhen \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 is )1 nT, and is zero when \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 is zero. In the\nlower panel the \u2018\u2018velocity\u2019\u2019 is switched \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018o\u0080\u2019\u2019 by \u2018\u2018IMF Bs\u2019\u2019 in\njust the same way, but may now take positive as well as negative\nvalues. Specifically, the flow is initially negative for 10 successive \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019\npoints (i.e. for 20 min), and then switches to positive for all \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019\npoints thereafter until a \u2018\u2018substorm\u2019\u2019 takes place. After the \u2018\u2018substorm\u2019\u2019\nthe flow reverts to negative for 10 successive \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 points, before\nswitching to positive again for all subsequent \u2018\u2018on\u2019\u2019 points until the\nnext \u2018\u2018substorm\u2019\u2019, etc. Fifteen \u2018\u2018substorms\u2019\u2019 are taken to occur during\nthe interval, at randomly-determined times shown by the arrows in the\nlower panel\n1312 H.

However, if the flow is found to reverse\nin sense with changing IMF Bz, relative to the Bz\npositive \u2018\u2018background\u2019\u2019, then the lag of the peak\ncorrelation need not correspond to the flow excitation\nand decay delay of primary interest here, but may occur\nat longer delays characteristic of the flow reversal time\nscale. We may further anticipate on the basis of Fig. 1\nthat such an e\u0080ect is most likely to occur in the pre-\nmidnight Harang region, where flows typically reverse\nfrom west to east as IMF Bz switches from positive to\nnegative. This e\u0080ect needs to be borne in mind when\nconsidering the results presented.\nFigure 4 thus presents representative results for\nvarious 2-h MLT intervals, where all the flow data\navailable for the interval have been combined together\nto produce the results shown. In each panel results for vE\nare shown on the left, while those for vN are shown on\nthe right. The upper graphs in each panel show the\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cient versus lag.

This formula is valid\nwhen n is large (n > 100, say), a condition well satisfied\nhere where the number of 2-min data values in a given\n2-h MLT interval varies from a minimum of about 200\nto a maximum of about 700 (see Fig. 5).

The lower graphs in\neach panel then show scatter plots of the respective\nvelocity components versus V2Bz, derived using the lag\ncorresponding to the peak in the cross-correlation curve\nas indicated at the top of each plot. The interplanetary\nparameter plotted is not V2Bz directly, but (V(km s\n)1)\/\n500)2Bz, in units of nT. That is, we have normalised the\nsolar wind speed V to a nominal value of 500 km s)1 so\nthat the variation of the ionospheric flow with typical\nIMF Bz values can more easily be appreciated. The solid\nlines in these plots represent the least-squares best fit\nto the half-wave rectified interplanetary function (i.e. a\nlinear variation for IMF Bz negative, and a constant\nvalue for IMF Bz positive).\nFigure 4a shows results for the 2-h interval centred\non noon (1100\u20131300 MLT), containing 608 flow mea-\nsurements. The cross-correlogram for vE shows a highly\nsignificant maximum near zero lag, with a peak coe\u0081-\ncient of 0.50 at a lag of 2 min (which is thus in accord\nwith the individual events shown in Fig. 2). The\nuncertainty in the determination of the lag at the peak\nFig. 4. a Results of the cross-correlation analysis between V2Bs and\nthe eastward (left hand) and northward (right hand) flow components\nfor the 2-h interval of local time centred on 1200 MLT.

A linear least-squares\nfit of the ionospheric velocity data to the function V2Bs is indicated by\nthe solid lines\n1314 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nis quantified from the error bar on the peak value by\nexamining how many adjacent cross-correlation values\nlie within its limits. In this case four values lie within\nthese limits at longer lags, and none at shorter lags. We\nthus take the \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 on the lag of the peak to lie\nbetween 2 and 10 min. Secondary and even tertiary\npeaks are also evident in the cross-correlogram, on both\nsides of the main peak. Analysis indicates, however, that\nthese are due to auto-correlation in the input interplan-\netary data at the corresponding periods, and are not due\nto secondary or tertiary response times in the iono-\nspheric flow. The positive value of the cross-correlation\ncoe\u0081cient at the peak implies the existence of westward\nionospheric flow (i.e. negative vE) when IMF Bz is\nnegative. This is confirmed by the scatter-plot shown\nbeneath the cross-correlogram plotted for a lag of\n2 min, which exhibits weak averaged westward flows\nfor IMF Bz positive (with no particular trend evident in\nthe data) and increasing westward flows for IMF Bz\nnegative. Since the scatter-plot shows that the enhanced\nflows present for IMF Bz negative are essentially\nconsistently westward, becoming generally stronger as\nIMF Bz becomes increasingly negative, it is appropriate\naccording to the above discussion to interpret the lag\ntime of the peak correlation as the flow excitation and\ndecay delay time. This conclusion is also consistent with\nthe small lag value (2 min) obtained. That the east-west\nflow in the noon sector is consistently westward at\nEISCAT latitudes agrees with the results of Weimer\n(1995) shown in Fig. 1, where we see that the dusk cell\ngenerally extends across noon to give westward flow at\nnoon at lower latitudes. A similar positive correlation\nFig. 4. b As for a except for the 2-h interval centred on 1500 MLT\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1315\nand mainly westward flow is also found here in the MLT\ninterval centred on 1100 MLT (not shown), reversing to\na negative correlation associated with the eastward flow\nof the dawn cell at 0800 and earlier MLT (see later).\nNo statistically significant correlation with vE is found\nfor the intervals centred on 0900 and 1000 MLT.\nThe right side of Fig. 4a shows results for vN in the\nnoon sector. The correlogram shows a clear negative\nminimum peaking at zero lag (with an \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019\nbetween )2 and +2 min), with a peak cross-correlation\ncoe\u0081cient of )0.42. The negative value implies increas-\ning northward flows (positive vN) for negative IMF Bz,\nas confirmed by the scatter plot underneath. Similar\nnegative vN correlations with relatively short response\ndelays, which we may interpret as the flow excitation\nand decay delay time, are found in the dayside hours\nover the interval 0700\u20131300 MLT, thus spanning the\ninterval \u00183 h on either side of the east-west flow reversal\nat 0900\u20131000 MLT.\nOn moving away from noon into the afternoon\nsector, clear correlations remain with the westward\ncomponent of the dusk cell flow, while the response of\nthe northward component tends to disappear. Results\nfor the 2-h interval centred on 1500 MLT are shown\nin Fig. 4b (containing 708 flow measurements),\nrepresentative of the interval 1300\u20131700 MLT. The\ncross-correlogram for vE shows a positive maximum\n(westward flow for negative IMF Bz) at a lag of 4 min\n(with \u2018\u2018error bars\u2019\u2019 between 0 and 10 min), with a\npeak value of 0.54. Again, two nearly symmetrical\nsecondary peaks are also present, due to autocorrela-\ntion of the interplanetary input. The corresponding\nFig. 4. c As for a except for the 2-h interval centred on 0700 MLT\n1316 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nscatter plot shows a flow that is now almost exclu-\nsively westward, which increases rapidly as IMF Bz\nbecomes more negative. Again, therefore, the lag time\nof the peak correlation can be interpreted as the\nexcitation and decay delay time of the flow. The\ncorrelogram for vN on the right of Fig. 4b, however,\nshows no clear peak and no values above the 99.9%\nsignificance level. In this case the scatter plot is shown\nfor the 4 min lag determined from vE, and indicates\nan essentially zero averaged latitudinal flow in this\nlocal time sector, independent of IMF Bz. The aver-\naged flow is thus almost purely westward in this local\ntime sector.\nFigure 4c shows related results for the dayside dawn\ncell, for the 2-h interval centred on 0700 MLT\n(containing 423 flow measurements). These are repre-\nsentative of the results obtained in the interval 0500\u2013\n0900 MLT, not previously covered in the study by\nEtemadi et al. (1988). The correlogram for vE now\nshows a negative minimum at a lag of 8 min (with an\n\u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 0 and 8 min), with a peak cross-\ncorrelation coe\u0081cient of )0.44. The scatter plot con-\nfirms that this correlation is related to an increasing\neastward flow for IMF Bz negative, with essentially zero\naveraged flow when IMF Bz is positive. Again, the\nmonotonic dependence of the flow component on IMF\nBz indicates that the lag of the peak correlation should\nbe interpreted as the flow excitation and decay delay\ntime. Similar results are obtained for vN, with a negative\npeak cross-correlation value of )0.26 occurring at a lag\nof 8 min (with an \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 6 and 8 min).\nThis correlation is associated with modestly increasing\nFig. 4. d As for a except for the 2-h interval centred on 0100 MLT\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1317\nnorthward flows for IMF Bz negative, with small\naveraged flows for Bz positive.\nThe dayside results surveyed above are indicative of\na major control on the flow exerted by the north-south\ncomponent of the IMF, with response delays at Troms\u00f8\nof just a few minutes relative to the arrival of first e\u0080ects\nat the ionosphere. Delay times are typically 2\u20134 min in\nthe noon-afternoon sector of the dusk cell, with an\nindication of an increase to \u00188 min near dawn. Results\nfor the nightside are not so clear-cut. Typically, the\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cients are lower and the extrema\nless well defined, presumably because of the increasingly\nimportant influence on the flow of tail processes\ncompared with magnetopause processes. Nevertheless,\nthe results are indicative of increased response delays\nof \u00185\u201315 min. Two examples from the post-midnight\ndawn cell are shown in Fig. 4d, e. Figure 4d shows\nresults for the 2-h interval centred on 0100 MLT\n(containing 225 flow measurements). Here the cross-\ncorrelogram for vE has a pronounced but broad mini-\nmum, with a peak of )0.58 at a lag of 16 min (with an\n\u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 14 and 34 min). The scatter plot\nshows that this corresponds to eastward flows which\nincrease strongly with increasingly negative IMF Bz\nfrom small average values for IMF Bz positive. No\nevidence for flow reversal e\u0080ects are observed in these\ndata, so that the lag time of the peak correlation should\nbe interpreted as the excitation and decay delay time.\nThe cross-correlogram for vN shows no pronounced\npeak for positive lags at values above the 99.9% level.\nFig. 4. e As for a except for the 2-h interval centred on 0400 MLT\n1318 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nThe scatter-plot, shown at a lag of 16 min as determined\nfrom vE, indicates weak averaged equatorward flows\nthat barely respond to the IMF. Figure 4e similarly\nshows results for the 2-h interval centred on 0400 MLT\n(containing 425 flow measurements). Here the correlo-\ngram for vE has a weak minimum of )0.28, but above\nthe 99.9% confidence level, at a lag of 14 min (with a\n\u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 2 and 16 min). The scatter plot\nagain shows consistently increasing eastward flows with\nincreasing negative IMF Bz, though scattered large\nvalues are also present for IMF Bz positive, perhaps due\nto tail (substorm) e\u0080ects. As before, the cross-correlo-\ngram for vN shows no pronounced peak above the\n99.9% confidence level. The scatter-plot at a lag of\n14 min shows weak averaged northward flows, which\nare independent of the IMF north-south polarity.\nThe final MLT interval which we need to discuss is\nthe sector from dusk to pre-midnight, i.e. the MLT\nhours centred on 1900\u20132300 MLT corresponding to the\nnightside region of the dusk cell. Here the results show\nrather di\u0080erent features, as exemplified by the data for\nthe 2-h interval centred on 2000 MLT displayed in\nFig. 4f (containing 682 flow measurements). Here the\ncross-correlogram for vE shows a broad but well-defined\npeak at a value of )0.38 with a delay of 34 min (with an\n\u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 30 and 38 min), a much longer\ndelay than found in other local time sectors, as we have\nseen. Furthermore, the scatter-plot corresponding to\nthis delay provides clear evidence of non-monotonic\nbehaviour of the east-west flow with IMF Bz, the flow\nbeing westward for IMF Bz positive, increasing in\nstrength somewhat for small negative Bz, and then\nFig. 4. f As for a except for the 2-h interval centred on 2000 MLT\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1319\nreversing in sense to become eastward for large negative\nBz. Very similar behaviour is found in the 2-h interval\ncentred on 1900 MLT, where the lag of the peak\ncorrelation again occurs with a delay of 34 min (within\nan \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 28 and 44 min). From the\nprevious discussion we may infer that this behaviour\nrelates to the passage of the Harang east-west flow\nreversal across the observing site as the flow system\nexpands with increasing negative IMF Bz. We then\nfurther infer that the lag of the peak correlation relates\nmore to the time scale required for the sense of the flow\nto change relative to the IMF Bz positive \u2018\u2018baseline\u2019\u2019,\nand not to the excitation and decay delay time as in\nother local time sectors. The results of the \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019\nanalysis presented in the next section support this\ninterpretation by showing that the initial flow response\nin this MLT sector to individual sharp switches in the\nsense of IMF Bz occur on significantly shorter time\nscales than those derived here from the cross-correlation\nanalysis, and that they involve an enhancement in the\nwestward flow when IMF Bz turns from positive to\nnegative (5 cases in the data set), and a reduction in the\neastward flow when IMF Bz turns from southward to\nnorthward (1 case in the data set). The cross-correlation\nresults for vE in the MLT intervals centred on 21 and\n22 MLT (not shown) are similar to those in Fig. 4f in\nthat they show that a generally weak but westward flow\nwhich is present for IMF Bz positive gives way to an\nincreasing eastward flow when IMF Bz is negative.\nHowever, the behaviour is now observed to be nearly\nmonotonic relative to the positive IMF Bz \u2018\u2018baseline\u2019\u2019,\nwith eastward flows appearing for relatively small\nnegative values of IMF Bz, and with little evidence of\nsignificant initial enhancements of westward flow. Cor-\nrespondingly, the lag of the peak correlation decreases\ntowards values which are similar to those obtained at\nother local times, i.e. 14 min at 2100 MLT (within an\n\u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 10 and 38 min), and 10 min at\n2200 MLT (within an \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between 6 and\n24 min). It seems reasonable to infer that these values\ncorrespond to a measure of the excitation and decay\ndelay time of the eastward flow in the pre-midnight\nsector.\nWe now turn to the results for vN in the pre-midnight\nHarang region, where, since the considerations which\napply to the reversing vE component no longer hold, we\nmay again suppose a priori that the lag time of the peak\ncorrelation will correspond to the excitation and decay\ndelay time. Correspondingly, the correlogram for vN for\nthe interval centred on 2000 MLT shown in Fig. 4f does\nnot show a peak at the same lag as for vE, but rather\nexhibits a very broad region of positive correlation with\na peak of 0.43 at an (unphysical) lag of )2 min (within\nan \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019 between )4 and +10 min). The vN\nscatter-plot shows a well-defined and monotonic in-\ncrease in equatorward flow with increasing negative\nIMF Bz. Similar vN behaviour is found in the interval\ncentred on 1900 MLT, but this e\u0080ect dies away with\nincreasing local time, and no significant correlations are\nfound for the interval centred on 2100 MLT and at later\nlocal times.\nWe will now summarise the outcome of the cross-\ncorrelation analysis, beginning in Fig. 5a by showing\nresults for the eastward component of ionospheric\nflow. The top panel firstly shows the number of flow\nmeasurements in each 2-h interval of MLT, varying\nbetween a minimum of about 200 in the post-midnight\nsector, to a maximum of about 700 in the afternoon and\nevening sector, as previously indicated. Beneath this we\nshow the response delay of the eastward flow compo-\nnent versus MLT, corresponding to the lag of the peak\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cient, with error bars determined\nas described. No value is shown if there was no peak\npresent above the 99.9% confidence level in the cross-\ncorrelogram. Below this we show the peak value of the\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cient itself. The lower two panels\nthen show the slope and intercept of the least-squares\nlines fitted to the scatter plots at the lag of the peak\ncorrelation (as shown in the lower graphs in Fig. 4). The\n\u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 velocity provides a measure of the average\nflow which is present for northward IMF, while the\n\u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 indicates how this baseline value changes in\nresponse to various levels of negative IMF Bz.\nIn line with the prior discussion, the results for vE can\nbe divided into three main regimes. The first is the\ndayside dusk cell westward flow regime indicated by the\nsquare symbols, observed between 1100 and 1700 MLT.\nHere the flow response delay is typically 2\u20134 min, and\nshows no discernible MLT variation within the resolu-\ntion of this study. The cross-correlation coe\u0081cients are\ntypically quite high, between \u00180.4 and \u00180.7, and tend to\nincrease with local time. The \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 values also\nincrease with MLT, corresponding to radar locations\nwhich are increasingly centrally located within the dusk\nflow cell, as do the \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 velocities, though the\nlatter remain quite small, less than \u0018200 m s)1. The\nsecond regime corresponds to the dawn cell eastward\nflow region indicated by the circular symbols, observed\nbetween 0000 and 0800 MLT. Here the flow response\ndelay times are short, \u00185 min, and similar to the dusk\ncell values on the dayside (certainly within the error\nbars), but tend to increase and become more scattered,\n\u00185\u201315 min, on the nightside. The peak cross-correlation\ncoe\u0081cients are lower than for the dusk cell, typically\n\u00180.3\u20130.4, while in common with the dusk cell, the\n\u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 values tend to increase on\nmoving from the dayside to the nightside, before\ndeclining somewhat near midnight. The third regime\ncorresponds to the nightside (Harang) region of the\ndusk cell, observed between 1900 and 2200 MLT,\nmarked by crosses. As noted already, this regime is\ncharacterised by the presence of westward flow for\nnorthward IMF, reversing to eastward flow for a\nsu\u0081ciently southward IMF, such that the \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019\nand \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 are of the same sign, unlike the opposite\nsigns of the other two regions. Here the response delays\nare very long (\u001830\u201340 min) at 1900 and 2000 MLT, but\ndecline to \u001810\u201315 min at 2100 and 2200 MLT as\noutlined. As previously indicated, the lag times of the\npeak correlation in the interval 1900\u20132000 MLT prob-\nably more reflect the time scale for flow reversal from\nwest to east due to expansion and evolution of the flow\n1320 H.

Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\ncells under the influence of southward IMF, rather than\nto the IMF-modulated flow excitation and decay time\nscale of main interest here. These two values will\nconsequently be excluded from further analysis of the\nlatter delay time.\nResults for vN shown in Fig. 5b are more restricted,\ndue to the fact that within the central parts of the\nflow cells the north-south flow tends to be weak and\nunresponsive to the IMF. Two regimes are evident,\ncorresponding to the region of negative correlations\nindicated by the square symbols (northward flow for\nsouthward IMF), which span the dayside east-west flow\nreversal centred on 0900\u20131000 MLT, and a region of\npositive correlations indicated by the circles (equator-\nward flow for southward IMF), which are observed in\nthe dusk and early evening sector. The noon-sector vN\ndata indicate similar short response delays as found for\nvE, and bridge the \u2018\u2018gap\u2019\u2019 in the latter results in the\ninterval where the east-west flow reverses. Typical cross-\ncorrelation coe\u0081cients are fairly low, \u0018)0.3. Values of\nthe \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 tend to be higher in the morning than\nnear noon, and the \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 remains small through-\nout. Short response delays are also indicated in the\nregion of positive correlation (equatorward flow) in the\ndusk and post-dusk sector, though the correlation\ndistributions tend to be very broad (Fig. 4f) and the\nFig. 5. a Summary of cross-correlation results for the vE component\nof ionospheric flow. The top panel shows the number of flow\nmeasurements in each 2-h interval of MLT used in the study,\nspecifically at zero lag (the number of points may vary slightly with\nlag due to gaps in the interplanetary data record). Beneath this we\nshow the lag of the peak value of the cross-correlation coe\u0081cient\n(min). In the next panel we show the value of the cross-correlation\ncoe\u0081cient at the peak. The lower two panels show the \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 values of the lines least squares-fitted to the scatter plots of\nvE versus (V\/500)\n2Bs, as shown in the lower panels of Fig. 4. The\nsquares indicate results corresponding to the dayside dusk flow cell\nwhere the correlation coe\u0081cient and \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 are positive, while the\n\u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 is negative (increasing westward flows for southward\nIMF). The circles indicate results corresponding to the dawn flow cell\nwhere the correlation coe\u0081cient and \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 are negative, while\nthe \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019 is positive (increasing eastward flows for southward\nIMF). The crosses indicate the Harang region of the nightside dusk\nflow cell where the correlation coe\u0081cient, \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019, and \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019\nare all negative (flow reverses from west to east as the IMF reverses\nfrom north to south).\nH.

Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nuncertainties large. Cross-correlation values peak at\n\u00180.6 at 1900 MLT, and \u2018\u2018gradient\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018intercept\u2019\u2019\nvalues tend to increase with increasing local time from\ndusk towards midnight.\nConsidering all of the vE flow response results shown\nin Fig. 5a, it can be seen that the data are consistent\nwith short, few-minute response delays on the dayside,\nand with increased delays on the nightside, though the\nscatter in the latter values is large. If we take all of the\ndayside values from 0700 to 1700 MLT and weight them\naccording to the inverse of the error bar to take account\nof their varying degrees of certainty, we find an average\ndelay time of 3.1 \u008b 0.8 min (the unweighted average is\n3.3 \u008b 0.8 min). (These averages are collected together\nand displayed in Table 1.) For the nightside values from\n2100 to 0500 MLT (excluding the two values at 1900 and\n2000 MLT for reasons discussed) we find a significantly\nhigher weighted average value of 8.0 \u008b 2.4 min (the\nunweighted average is 9.7 \u008b 1.9 min). Here the errors\nare quoted as the standard error of the weighted mean\n(i.e. the standard deviation divided by the root of the\nnumber of samples in the case of equal weights). For the\nnorth-south component of the flow, the dayside data\nshown in Fig. 5b confirm the short response delays\nwhich are present in the noon sector. The weighted\naverage response delay of the vN values in the interval\n0700\u20131300 MLT is found to be 3.7 \u008b 1.8 min, entirely\nconsistent with the dayside results for vE. The vN results\nin the dusk sector also indicate short, few-minute delays.\nThese data are comparable to the values obtained from\nvE in the pre-dusk sector, but are much shorter than the\n\u001830\u201340 min values obtained from vE in the post-dusk\nsector, for reasons already discussed.\nAlthough the discussion has concentrated on the\ncross-correlation results for the two flow components\ntaken separately, it is also of interest to combine the\nresults together. This significantly improves the MLT\ncoverage, since, as we have seen, the flow responds\nprincipally in the east-west component in some sectors,\nand principally in the north-south component in others.\nAt local times where both components provide an\nestimate of the flow response delay, we have taken the\nsmaller of the two values on the basis that the true\nresponse delay for the flow in a particular MLT sector\ncorresponds to the minimum value obtained, irrespec-\ntive of the component in which it was observed. The\nresults are shown in Fig. 5c, where square symbols\nindicate values derived from the east-west flow compo-\nnent, while circles indicate values derived from the\nnorth-south flow component; where both components\ngive the same value we show the point with the smallest\nerror bar. Again the results suggest longer delays on the\nnightside compared with the dayside, with the weighted\naverage of the dayside values being 2.2 \u008b 0.9 min\n(2.7 \u008b 0.8 min unweighted), while that for the nightside\nbeing 5.5 \u008b 2.5 min (7.1 \u008b 2.3 min unweighted). How-\never, the results taken together suggest that the mini-\nmum response delay actually occurs in the post-noon\nsector, near 1400 MLT, rather than at noon itself.\nAlthough the scatter in this data set is rather large, the\nreality of the o\u0080set from noon is suggested by the fact\nthat a very similar e\u0080ect was previously observed in\nthe cross-correlation and event analyses performed by\nEtemadi et al. (1988) and Todd et al. (1988), respective-\nly, using EISCAT flow data measured at higher latitudes\n(71\u00b0\u201373\u00b0). It also occurs in the event analysis presented\nhere in the following section. If we then average the data\nin Fig. 5c over the 12-h sectors centred on 1400 MLT\nand 0200 MLT, the weighted averages are found to be\n1.3 \u008b 0.8 min and 8.8 \u008b 1.7 min, respectively (see\nTable 1). (The unweighted values are 1.8 \u008b 0.7 min\nand 9.6 \u008b 1.5 min, respectively.) The di\u0080erence be-\ntween \u2018\u2018dayside\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018nightside\u2019\u2019 response delays is thus\nestimated as 7.5 \u008b 1.9 min.\nThe results shown in Fig. 5c suggest that at the\nlatitude of EISCAT, at least, IMF-modulated changes\nin the flow are observed first in the immediate post-noon\nsector, and then propagate into the nightside, such that\nthe response is delayed in the latter region relative to the\nformer. In order to give an indication of the e\u0080ective\nTable 1. Averaged flow response delays in di\u0080erent local time sectors derived from the various data sets employed in this study.

Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1323\nphase speed of that propagation we have employed a\nsimple model in which, starting at zero delay time, the\ninformation propagates radially outwards from the\ndayside open-closed field line boundary, taken to lie\ntypically at \u001877\u00b0 magnetic latitude (according to obser-\nvations of the location of the equatorward border of the\ncusp reported by Newell et al., 1989). The propagation\nspeed and the local time of the epicentre of information\npropagation have then been stepped (through half-hour\nintervals of local time) until the least squares best fit to\nthe cross-correlation data in Fig. 5c has been found.\nThis procedure yields an epicentre located at 1400 MLT\n(thus validating the division of the data chosen), and a\nphase speed of 9.0 km s)1. The best-fit line is superposed\non the data in Fig. 5c. It is seen to follow the trends in\nthe data tolerably well, though we would hesitate to call\nit a \u2018\u2018good fit\u2019\u2019 due to the large error bars and the\nconsequent scatter in the data.\n4 Event analysis\nIn order to complement the results of the cross-\ncorrelation analysis reported, we here present the results\nof an \u2018\u2018event analysis\u2019\u2019 undertaken in the manner of\nTodd et al. (1988), using the same data set as earlier.\nWe have looked for the occurrence of sharp polarity\nchanges in the IMF Bz component, and have then\nexamined concurrent measurements of the ionospheric\nflow to find the time at which the first response was\nobserved, relative to the arrival time of first possible\nIMF e\u0080ects. The latter time was determined from the\nIMP-8 interplanetary data in essentially the same way as\nfor the cross-correlation analysis (see Appendix), except\nthat the orientation of the \u2018\u2018phase front\u2019\u2019 of the IMF was\ndetermined and employed for each \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019 individually,\nwith the delay time calculated from solar wind plasma\ndata averaged over the same 10\u201315 min intervals on\neither side of the \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019 (the IMF discontinuity) as\nwere used to average the field for the \u2018\u2018phase front\u2019\u2019\n(discontinuity normal) analysis. The time of the iono-\nspheric flow response was then determined as the centre-\ntime of the 2-min radar data averaging interval that\nshowed the first enduring change that could be ascribed\nto the e\u0080ect of the IMF, outside of the range of previous\nfluctuations of the flow data. Overall, the responses to\na total of 69 such interplanetary \u2018\u2018events\u2019\u2019 were analysed\nin this study.\nWe first show a few individual examples in various\nlocal time sectors before describing the overall results.\nTwo \u2018\u2018southward turn\u2019\u2019 events observed when EISCAT\nwas in the noon sector were previously discussed\nin Sect. 2 and displayed in Fig. 2, where response delays\nin the westward flow component of 3 \u008b 1 min were\ndetermined, consistent with the results of the cross-\ncorrelation analysis in this local time sector (Fig. 5a).\nHere (Fig. 6a) we therefore begin by showing data for\nthe interval 1200\u20131400 UT on 16 March, 1994, corre-\nsponding to the mid-afternoon sector (1430\u20131630 MLT)\nof the dusk flow cell (see also the correlation results in\nFig. 4b). The format is the same as for Fig. 2. Two\nperiods of predominantly southward fields can be seen\nin the IMF, observed by IMP-8 in the intervals 1213\u2013\n1229 UT and 1304\u20131329 UT, respectively, as indicated\nby the vertical dashed lines in the upper panel. (We\nneglect short-term variations of the field, on times scales\nless than \u00185 min, to which no ionospheric response can\nbe discerned.) The e\u0080ect of the first southward turn at\n1213 UT is estimated to have arrived at the ionosphere\nat 1225 UT (a delay of 12 min relative to IMP-8,\nindicated by the first vertical dashed line in the lower\npanels), and is clearly associated with the onset of a flow\nwhich is directed westward and (weakly) equatorward.\nThe response delay is somewhat obscured in this case by\na one-point data gap centred at 1223 UT, but when data\nis resumed 1225 UT the weak equatorward flow is\nclearly already in progress, while the westward flow is\nnot clearly increasing consistently and at larger values\nthan those occurring previously until 1229 UT. The\nresponse delay of vN is therefore taken to be essentially\nzero, while that of vE is about 4 min. The e\u0080ect of the\nsubsequent northward turn of the IMF, observed by\nIMP-8 at 1229 UT (second dashed line in the upper\npanel), is estimated to have arrived at the ionosphere at\n1240 UT (second dashed line in the lower panels). The\ncessation of the perturbation in vN is rather gradual,\nfrom which no timing information is deduced, while the\nfirst time at which the westward flow is observed to\ndecline (outside the range of general fluctuations in the\ndata) occurs at 1245 UT, with a delay of 5 min. The\nwestward flow then died away gradually from \u0018500 to\n\u0018100 m s)1 over an interval of \u001820 min, as previously\nobserved in this MLT sector by Todd et al. (1988). The\nIMF then turned south again at 1304 UT, with e\u0080ects\nreaching the ionosphere at 1314 UT (third dashed lines).\nThe first measurements exhibiting a clear enhancement\nin the flow are centred at 1319 UT in vN, with a delay\nof 5 min, and at 1317 UT in vE, with a delay of 3 min.\nFinally, an enduring northward turn took place at\n1329 UT, reaching the ionosphere at 1341 UT (fourth\ndashed lines). Both flow components show a first clear\nresponse at 1343 UT, with a delay of 2 min, declining to\nsmall values over a \u001810 min interval. Overall, therefore,\nwe infer small response delays in both flow components\nof typically \u00185 min or less. These individual observa-\ntions are therefore entirely compatible with the results\nof the cross-correlation analysis in this MLT sector\ndiscussed (Fig. 4b), which show peak correlations with a\ndelay of 4 min for the east-west flow component, though\nthere are no significant responses in the north-south flow\nin the data set as a whole.\nIn Fig. 6b we show corresponding data for the\ndayside dawn flow cell, for the interval 0420\u20130620 UT\n(0650\u20130850 MLT) on 19 June, 1996. Here sharp south-\nward turns of the IMF were observed by IMP-8 at 0454,\n0517, and 0542 UT (the second, third, and fifth dashed\nlines in the upper panel), which lead to excitation of\nrelatively weak eastward and poleward flows (essentially\nsimultaneously) at 0509, 0539, and 0601 UT (related\ndotted lines in the lower panels), with delays relative to\nfirst possible e\u0080ects (related dashed lines in the lower\npanels) of 5, 12, and 8 min, respectively. Sharp north-\n1324 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nward turns were also observed at 0436 and 0531 UT (the\nfirst and fourth set of vertical lines), leading to decay of\nthose flows starting at 0457 and 0551 UT, with delays\nrelative to first e\u0080ects of 10 and 9 min, respectively.\nResponse delays are thus typically \u001810 min in this\ninterval, compatible with the cross-correlation results\nfor thepost-dawnflow shownpreviously inFigs. 4c and5.\nFigure 6c shows results for an interval spanning\nmidnight, 2045\u20132245 UT (2315\u20130115 MLT) on 15\nMarch, 1994. Several potentially corresponding IMF\nand flow features appear during this interval, including\nthe flow pulse centred on \u00182135 UT which may be\nrelated to a brief interval of southward field beginning at\n\u00182120 UT. However, we restrict attention here to the\nFig. 6. b As for Fig. 2, except for\nthe interval 0420\u20130620 UT (0650\u2013\n0850 MLT) on 19 June, 1996\nFig. 6. a As for Fig. 2, except\nfor the interval 1200\u20131400 UT\n(1430\u20131630 MLT) on 16 March,\n1994\nH.

We note that\nwhen considering the nightside flow data, magnetic\nrecords from the IMAGE and SAMNET magnetometer\nchains in the Scandinavian sector were examined in\norder to ensure that flow variations associated with\nsubstorms were not misidentified as IMF-related flow\nchanges. During this interval, for example, a Pi2 signal\nFig. 6. d As for Fig. 2, except for\nthe interval 1630\u20131830 UT (1900\u2013\n2100 MLT) on 18 June, 1996\nFig. 6. c As for Fig. 2, except for\nthe interval 2045\u20132245 UT (2315\u2013\n0115 MLT) on 15 March, 1994\n1326 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nwas observed by stations of the SAMNET chain starting\nat \u00182110 UT (indicated by the arrow in Fig. 6c), well\nbefore the flow enhancement discussed, but no clear\nsubstorm-associated onset was related to the flow\nenhancement itself.\nFinally, in Fig. 6d we show results of a somewhat\ndi\u0080erent character observed in the nightside dusk cell\nin the interval 1630\u20131830 UT (1900\u20132100 MLT) on 18\nJune, 1996. In this interval a north to south switch in\nIMF Bz took place at 1701 UT (dashed line in the\nupper panel), following which (apart from brief inter-\nvals) a southward field of \u0018)1 to )3 nT then endured\nfor more than 1.5 h. Thus not only the initial response\nof the flow can be discerned, but also its long-term\nbehaviour under essentially continuous negative IMF\nBz. The first e\u0080ects of the southward turn are estimated\nto have arrived at the ionosphere at 1712 UT (dashed\nline in the lower panel), following which a weak\nequatorward flow and enhanced westward flow devel-\noped. The weak (\u001850\u2013100 m s)1) equatorward flows\nare present at and after 1717 UT (dotted line in the\nmiddle panel), with a delay of 5 min, while the\nwestward flow developed more gradually over a\n\u001840 min interval, with a less well-defined onset. The\ntime beyond which this flow development is unques-\ntionably in progress has been set at 1723 UT as marked\nby the dotted line in the lower panel, with a delay of\n11 min, though it could be argued as having started\nearlier, at the time of excitation of the equatorward\nflow. Significant further development of the westward\nflow, from \u0018100 to \u0018500 m s)1, occurred gradually\nafter this time, presumably related to the expansion of\nthe region of open flux and flow cells during this\ninterval. It may be remembered that the cross-correla-\ntion results for this MLT sector, shown in Fig. 4f,\nindicate peak correlations of the east-west flow with a\nlag of 34 min, with westward flows occurring for\npositive and small negative IMF Bz reversing to become\neastward for large negative IMF Bz. The event shown\nhere in Fig. 6d indicates that the response of the east-\nwest flow in this sector to the onset of relatively weak\nnegative IMF Bz is a westward flow with a prompt\nonset (a delay of only \u00185\u201310 min) which then develops\nin magnitude over a few tens of minutes, thus support-\ning our previous suggestion that the long cross-corre-\nlation delays found for vE in this MLT sector are\nrelated to the time scale for the expansion of the flow\ncells rather than to the initial excitation of flow. In the\npresent example, however, the flow did not subsequent-\nly reverse to eastward as in the cross-correlation results,\npresumably because IMF Bz was not su\u0081ciently neg-\native for a su\u0081cient interval. The flow speed of the\nsolar wind was rather low during this interval,\nV \u00bb 390 km s)1, such that with IMF Bz typically\n\u0018)2 nT we have (V\/500)2Bz \u00bb )1 nT. It is then noted\nfrom Fig. 4f that eastward flows are typically present in\nthis MLT sector only for (V\/500)2Bz less than \u0018)4 nT.\nOn the other hand, the rapid (5 min) response of the\nnorth-south component of the flow seen in Fig. 6d is\ncompatible with the results of the cross-correlation\nanalysis for this flow component (Fig. 4f), which shows\na broad peak near zero lag with an \u2018\u2018error bar\u2019\u2019\nspanning the range from )4 to +10 min.\nHaving thus illustrated the method employed, which\nas we have seen is not without its ambiguities on\noccasion, in Fig. 7 we present the overall event analysis\nresults, where we plot the flow response delay versus\nMLT in a similar format to Fig. 5. Results for the east-\nwest flow component are shown in Fig. 7a, where solid\nsymbols indicate response delays determined from flow\nenhancements following southward turns of the IMF,\nwhile large open symbols indicate delays determined\nfrom flow decreases following northward turns. For\npurposes of easy comparison, these are overlaid on\nthe cross-correlation results from the previous section,\nshown by the smaller open symbols with error bars\njoined by the dashed line. As in Fig. 5, all circular\nsymbols indicate the excitation of eastward flow for\nnegative IMF Bz, usually corresponding to the dawn\ncell, while square symbols indicate that the excitation of\nwestward flow for negative IMF Bz, usually correspond-\ning to the dusk cell. Several points are worth noting.\nFirst, no distinction is apparent between the response\ndelays determined from southward as opposed to\nnorthward turns of the field. Thus the propagation of\ninformation through the ionosphere concerning the\nonset of flow following a southward turn of the IMF\nappears to occur on essentially the same time scale as\nthe propagation of the start of the decay following a\nnorthward turn. Second, the event analysis results are in\noverall agreement with the cross-correlation results,\nsuch that the values determined in a given MLT sector\ngenerally fall within the \u2018\u2018error bars\u2019\u2019 of the cross-\ncorrelation values in that sector. The main exception\noccurs in the immediate post-dusk region, where, as we\nstated in the previous section, the \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019 delays are\ntypically short (\u00185\u201315 min) and comparable to results\nin the adjacent sectors, while the cross-correlation delays\nare much longer (\u001835 min). The origins of this e\u0080ect\nhave already been discussed. It is also noticeable,\nhowever, that the \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019 delays are typically a few\nminutes longer than the cross-correlation delays in the\npre-noon east-west flow reversal region spanning 0800\u2013\n1100 MLT. The origins of this di\u0080erence are not\nobvious. Third, the results again show a minimum delay\noccurring in the immediate post-noon hours at\n\u00181400 MLT, with a trend towards larger delays at\nnight compared with the dayside. The average delay\ntime for the dayside is 5.4 \u008b 0.5 min (Table 1), com-\npared with 3.1 \u008b 0.8 min from the corresponding cross-\ncorrelation analysis. For the nightside, the average\ndelay time is 11.6 \u008b 1.4 min (Table 1), compared with\n8.0 \u008b 2.4 min from the cross-correlation analysis. The\nevent analysis delay times for vE are thus in reasonable\naccord with the cross-correlation delay times, though\ntypically longer by \u00182\u20133 min (corresponding to one or\ntwo flow data points).\nResults for the north-south component are shown\nin Fig. 7b in a similar format to Fig. 7a, except that\ncircular symbols indicate equatorward flow for negative\nIMF Bz, while square symbols indicate poleward flow\n(as in Fig. 5b). The average response delay determined\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1327\nfrom the dayside data is 5.8 \u008b 0.5 min, again compa-\nrable with the corresponding dayside cross-correlation\nresult of 3.7 \u008b 1.8 min. The number of nightside\ndeterminations and their distribution in MLT is insuf-\nficient to allow a meaningful average to be taken.\nAs with the cross-correlation results, we have also\ncombined the east-west and north-south flow \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019\ndata together, by taking the true response delay to\ncorrespond to the first response observed in the flow\nirrespective of the component in which it was observed.\nIn Fig. 7c we therefore show this minimum delay time\nversus MLT for all 69 events analysed in this study. The\nclosed symbols represent results obtained from flow\nenhancements following southward turns of the IMF\n(46 events), while the open symbols represent results\nfrom the onset of flow decays following northward\nturns of the IMF (23 events). As before, no systematic\ndi\u0080erences are observed between these cases. Similarly,\nsquare symbols indicate that the first response was seen\nin the east-west flow component (38 events), circular\nsymbols that the first response was seen in the north-\nsouth flow component (18 events), and triangles indicate\nsimultaneous responses in both components (13 events).\nNo clear MLT trends are observed in these types of\nresponse. However, evidence is again obtained of\nincreasing delays from dayside to nightside, with min-\nimum delays in the post-noon sector. The average delay\nfor the dayside data is 4.8 \u008b 0.5 min, while the average\nfor the nightside data is 8.7 \u008b 1.1 min (Table 1).\nNoting the post-noon minimum, however, if instead\nwe average over the 12-h sector centred on 1400 MLT\nwe find a value of 4.8 \u008b 0.5 min as before, while if we\naverage over the 12-h sector centred on 0200 MLT we\nfind a value of 9.2 \u008b 0.8 min (Table 1). To illustrate\nthis di\u0080erence directly, Fig. 8 shows normalised histo-\ngrams of the distribution of delay times for the 12-h\nFig. 7. a Ionospheric flow response delays\nversus MLT determined from the event\nanalysis keyed to sudden changes in the\nsense of the north-south component of the\nIMF, for the east-west component of flow.\nSolid symbols indicate delay times deter-\nmined from the onset of increases in flow\nassociated with southward turns of the\nIMF, while open symbols indicate response\ndelays determined from the onset of flow\ndecay associated with northward turns of\nthe IMF. Circular symbols indicate that the\nflow excited is eastward, generally corre-\nsponding to the dawn flow cell, while\nsquares indicate the flow is westward,\ngenerally corresponding to the dusk flow\ncell (as in Fig. 5). These data are plotted\nover the delay times determined from the\nvE cross-correlation analysis as in Fig. 5\n(smaller open symbols with error bars\njoined by dashed lines)\nFig. 7. b As for a, except for the north-\nsouth flow component. The square symbols\nindicate poleward flow, while the circular\nsymbols indicate equatorward flow (as in\nFig. 5)\n1328 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nsector centred on 1400 MLT (Fig. 8a), and for the 12-h\nsector centred on 0200 MLT (Fig. 8b). The data are\nshown in 2-min bins, normalised to the total number of\nevents in the two regions. The average values given\nabove are indicated by the arrow and dot-dashed line.\nThe two distributions are clearly di\u0080erent, with the\nnightside values being shifted to longer delay times\ncompared with the dayside values. Even so, it should\nagain be emphasised that the delay times are found to be\nrelatively short at all local times, with the di\u0080erence\nbetween the 1400 MLT sector and 0200 MLT sector\naverage values being only 4.4 \u008b 0.9 min.\nThe results presented here thus again provide evi-\ndence of a propagation of information about changes in\nthe flow through the ionosphere from the dayside to the\nnightside, with minimum delays in the immediate post-\nnoon sector. We have again fit this data to the simple\ntheoretical model of information propagation that we\nemployed above for the combined cross-correlation\nresults (Fig. 5c), and have derived the best fit local time\nof the epicentre from which the propagation starts\n(assumed to lie at 77\u00b0 magnetic latitude), and the phase\nspeed. This procedure yields an epicentre located at\n1400 MLT, and a phase speed of 6.8 km s)1. The best-\nfit line is plotted in Fig. 7c, and is seen to follow the\ntrends in the event data reasonably well.\n5 Summary and discussion\nWe have compared \u0018300 simultaneous hours of obser-\nvations of the high-latitude ionospheric flow obtained\nby the EISCAT UHF radar with measurements of the\ninterplanetary field made by the IMP-8 spacecraft\nupstream from the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, in order to\ndetermine the time scale on which the ionospheric flow\nresponds to changes in the north-south component of\nthe IMF. The field-perpendicular ionospheric flow\nvectors were determined using tristatic velocity data\nfrom the EISCAT CP-1-K common programme exper-\niment, in which the plasma velocity is continuously\nmonitored with 2-min resolution at an altitude of\n278 km along the field line at Troms\u00f8 (66.3\u00b0 magnetic\nlatitude). The data cover all magnetic local times,\nthough with a preference for the hemisphere centred\non dusk compared with the hemisphere centred on\ndawn. Two analysis techniques have been employed. In\nthe first the flow data were divided into overlapping 2-h\nintervals of MLT, and cross-correlated with the half-\nwave rectifier function V2Bs, where the latter data were\nsuitably shifted in time to take account of the propa-\ngation of the IMF from the spacecraft to the subsolar\nmagnetopause, and its e\u0080ects from thence to the cusp\nionosphere. A similar cross-correlation analysis was\npreviously performed by Etemadi et al. (1988) using\ndata from the EISCAT \u2018\u2018Polar\u2019\u2019 experiment (at latitudes\n\u001871\u00b0\u201373\u00b0), but the analysis only spanned the dayside\nhours between \u00181030 and \u00181700 MLT, corresponding\nmainly to the westward flows of the \u2018\u2018dusk\u2019\u2019 flow cell.\nHere we have extended these results to include the\ndayside dawn flow cell and the nightside hours.\nOur cross-correlation results show that for the east-\nwest flow component statistically significant peaks in the\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cient are obtained at nearly all\nFig. 7. c As for a, except that the mini-\nmum delay is shown for each event,\nirrespective of which flow component is\ninvolved. Closed symbols indicate respons-\nes to southward turns of the IMF, while\nopen symbols indicate responses to north-\nward turns of the IMF. Responses ob-\nserved first in the east-west flow\ncomponent are shown by squares, while\nthose observed first in the north-south\ncomponent are shown by circles. If both\ncomponents responded simultaneously the\nsymbol is plotted as a triangle. These data\nhave been least-squares fit to the same\nsimple theoretical model as in Fig. 5c,\nshown by the solid line. In this case the\nbest-fit epicentre of information propaga-\ntion was also found to lie at 1400 MLT,\nwhile the expansion phase speed was found\nto be 6.8 km s)1\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1329\nlocal times, except principally for the pre-noon hours\n(\u00180900\u20131000 MLT) where the east-west flow reverses\nin sense between the flow cells. However, the nightside\ncross-correlation coe\u0081cients are typically smaller than\non the dayside and the results correspondingly more\nscattered. The scatter-plots of the east-west flow versus\nV2Bs corresponding to the peak cross-correlation coef-\nficient generally show relatively weak averaged flows for\nnorthward IMF which change monotonically as V2Bs\nbecomes increasingly negative. In this case we may\ninterpret the lag of the peak correlation as the IMF-\nmodulated flow excitation and decay delay time, which\nlies typically in the range 0\u201315 min. However, in the pre-\nmidnight Harang region the response times become\nsignificantly longer (\u001830\u201340 min), while the correspond-\ning scatter plots for the east-west flow show the presence\nof non-monotonic behaviour. Westward flows which are\npresent for positive IMF Bz intensify for small south-\nward IMF, and then decline and reverse to become\neastward for strong negative IMF Bz. In this case the\nextremum in the cross-correlation coe\u0081cient need not\noccur at the excitation and decay delay time, but at a\nlater time more representative of the time scale for flow\nreversal relative to the northward IMF \u2018\u2018baseline\u2019\u2019. Such\ndata have been excluded from our subsequent analysis.\nThe average east-west flow response delay time for\nthe dayside cross-correlation data, weighted according\nto the inverse of the uncertainty estimates of the values,\nis found to be 3.1 \u008b 0.8 min. This value is closely\ncomparable to the corresponding results of Etemadi\net al. (1988) when the \u00182 min propagation from the\nmagnetopause to the ionosphere is (as here) subtracted.\nOn the nightside, the weighted average value increases to\n8.0 \u008b 2.4 min, where the results from the 1900\u20132000\nMLT Harang region have been omitted. Statistically\nsignificant responses of the north-south flow are more\nrestricted in MLT, and are confined to the dayside\ninterval 0700\u20131300 MLT for poleward flows excited by\nsouthward IMF, and to the dusk sector 1700\u20132000 MLT\nfor equatorward flows excited by southward IMF. The\nweighted average response delay of the former values\nis 3.7 \u008b 1.8 min, entirely compatible with the dayside\nresults for the east-west flow. The dusk-sector values are\nalso consistent with a relatively small delay in the range\n0\u20135 min, though the cross-correlation distributions are\ntypically very broad and the error bars correspondingly\nlarge.\nWhen these data are suitably combined together they\nindicate that the minimum response delay occurs at\n\u00181400 MLT. The overall weighted average delay for the\n12-h sector centred on 1400 MLT is 1.3 \u008b 0.8 min,\nwhile that for the 12-h sector centred on 0200 MLT is\n8.8 \u008b 1.7 min. The implication is that information\nabout IMF-related modulations of the flow propagates\nthrough the ionosphere away from the postnoon sector.\nIn order to quantify the phase speed of that propagation\nwe have fitted a simple model to the combined data in\nwhich information propagates radially outwards from\nan epicentre located on the dayside open-closed field line\nboundary (taken to lie at 77\u00b0 magnetic latitude) at a\nconstant phase speed. In this case the best fit is obtained\nfor an epicentre centred at 1400 MLT and a phase speed\nof 9.0 km s)1.\nIn the second complementary analysis of the same\ndata set we have inspected the IMF time series for sharp\nFig. 8. a Histogram showing the normalised distribution of the\nnumber of events contributing to each 2-min bin of ionospheric flow\ndelay time, for the 12-h local time sector centred on 1400 MLT. The\naverage delay of all the dayside events is marked by the arrow and dot-\ndashed line. b As for a except for the 12-h local time sector centred on\n0200 MLT\n1330 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nchanges in the sign of the north-south component, and\nhave then examined the ionospheric measurements to\ndetermine the time at which the flow responds, either with\nan increase in flow following a southward turn, or a\ndecrease in flow following a northward turn. In all, a total\nof 69 such events have been analysed and included in the\nstudy. A similar analysis was previously performed on\nthe EISCAT \u2018\u2018Polar\u2019\u2019 data by Todd et al. (1988), but\nincluded many fewer events and was again restricted in\nlocal time coverage mainly to the dayside hours. The\nresults confirm and extend those derived from the cross-\ncorrelation study summarised. For the east-west flow\ncomponent, minimum delays are centred on the post-\nnoon sector, with average response delays of 5.4 \u008b\n0.5 min on the dayside, increasing to 11.6 \u008b 1.4 min on\nthe nightside. These values are consistent with, but a little\nlonger (by \u00182\u20133 min) than the cross-correlation values\nfor the east-west flow quoted. No distinction was\napparent between the response times determined from\nthe onset of flow excitation following southward turns,\nand the onset of flow decay following northward turns.\nFor the north-south flow component, the dayside average\nwas found to be 5.8 \u008b 0.5 min, with insu\u0081cient event\ndeterminations being available on the nightside to take a\nmeaningful average.\nWe have also combined the event data for both flow\ncomponents together, and have taken the flow response\ndelay to correspond to the first flow change observed in\neach event, irrespective of which component is involved.\nThese data again show a minimum delay in the post-\nnoon sector, with increased response delays on the\nnightside. When the simple theoretical model outlined is\nfitted to this data, it is found that the best fit is again\nobtained for an epicentre of information propagation\ncentred on 1400 MLT, with a phase speed of 6.8 km s)1.\nThe average of the delays for the 12-h sector centred on\n1400 MLT was found to be 4.8 \u008b 0.5 min, increasing\nto 9.2 \u008b 0.8 min for the 12-h interval centred on\n0200 MLT.\nIt may be noted that the post-noon minimum in the\nresponse delay found here was also observed in the\nearlier studies by Etemadi et al. (1988) and Todd et al.\n(1988). This asymmetry may possibly reflect the Parker\nspiral structure of the IMF, which should generally\nproduce a \u2018\u2018first contact\u2019\u2019 of a similarly oriented inter-\nplanetary tangential discontinuity with the post-noon\nmagnetopause. Examination of our interplanetary data\nshows that the plane of the discontinuities were indeed\npreferentially oriented in this direction. The phase speed\nof propagation is also consistent with the values\ndeduced from the earlier, more limited, studies by\nEtemadi et al. (1988), Todd et al. (1988), Lockwood\net al. (1993), and Saunders et al. (1992), whose data are\nconsistent with values in the range 5\u201310 km s)1. The\nshort (several minute) response delays found here are\nalso consistent with the overall delays of 8 \u008b 8 min\nfound in the study presented by Ridley et al. (1998).\nHowever, the latter authors also interpreted their data\nas indicating an essentially simultaneous response\n(within \u00181 min) at all local times over the high-latitude\nregion. This conclusion is not in accord with our finding\nhere of longer response times on the nightside than on\nthe dayside, though we would point out that the\ndi\u0080erence we found here between these responses is\nonly \u00186 min. Finally we note that our response times\nare much shorter than the values of \u001820\u201330 min\ndetermined by Hairston and Heelis (1995) using DMSP\nspacecraft data. We thus concur with these authors that\nthe response times which they deduced are more\ncharacteristic of the development of the flow pattern\nas a whole following changes in the IMF, rather than the\nIMF-modulated flow excitation and decay delay which\nhas been our primary concern here.\nAcknowledgements.

This\npropagation delay consists of the sum of three compo-\nnents: (1) the time between the appearance of the feature\nat the spacecraft and its arrival at the subsolar bow\nshock, (2) the frozen-in transit time across the subsolar\nmagnetosheath, and (3) the Alfve\u00b4nic propagation time\nalong open field lines from the subsolar magnetopause\nto the cusp ionosphere. The method used to determine\neach of these contributions will now be discussed,\ntogether with their application in the case of the present\nstudy and their likely uncertainties.\nTransit time between the spacecraft\nand subsolar bow shock\nFor a spacecraft located on the Earth-Sun line, the\ntransit time of field changes between the spacecraft and\nthe subsolar bow shock is simply determined from the\ndistance to the bow shock (determined from empirical\nmodels as described below) divided by the observed\nsolar wind speed. However, in general the spacecraft will\nbe located at some distance from the Earth-Sun line, and\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1331\nwe then require to know where corresponding field\nchanges are located on the Earth-Sun line at the same\ntime as they are observed by the spacecraft. In other\nwords we need to determine, or assume, the orientation\nof the \u2018\u2018phase fronts\u2019\u2019 in the IMF so that the intersection\nwith the Earth-Sun line of the phase front which passes\nthrough the satellite can be determined. We therefore\nexamined the IMF data corresponding to each 2-h\ninterval of radar data, and determined the orientation of\nthe plane of the sharp field changes which were\nobserved, assuming that these changes represent tan-\ngential discontinuities propagating in the solar wind.\nTypically the field vectors were averaged over 10\u201315 min\nintervals on either side of the discontinuity, and their\ncross-product taken to determine the discontinuity\nnormal. Usually, several (2 to 6) such determinations\ncould be made for each 2-h interval, and in these cases\nthe orientations of the discontinuities were generally\nfound to be mutually consistent, with normals typically\nlying near the equatorial plane perpendicular to the\ngarden-hose direction. These were then used to deter-\nmine an overall representative delay time for the interval\naccording to the algorithm described later. In a few\ncases, however, no sharp field changes occurred in the\ninterval in question, and in these cases we simply\nassumed that the phase fronts were aligned perpendic-\nular to the Earth-Sun line.\nEstimation of the subsolar magnetosheath transit\ntime from the bow shock to the magnetopause\nWhen the solar wind encounters the subsolar bow shock\nits speed is suddenly reduced by a factor of \u00184 for large\nupstream magnetosonic Mach numbers. According to\ngas-dynamic models the speed then continues to fall as\nthe plasma traverses the magnetosheath and reaches the\nmagnetopause. Accurate estimation of the overall\npropagation time requires that these e\u0080ects are taken\ninto account. In order to do this we need to know the\ngeocentric distances of the magnetopause and bow\nshock, and to model the plasma speed between them.\nRoelof and Sibeck (1993) have provided a comprehen-\nsive empirical model of the position of the magneto-\npause, in which the boundary is modelled as an ellipsoid\nof revolution about the aberrated X axis whose form\ndepends on both IMF Bz and the solar wind dynamic\npressure p. For purposes of our study, we wish to\ndetermine one representative delay time that can be\napplied to few-hour segments of interplanetary data.\nSince IMF Bz typically varies significantly about a near-\nzero mean on such time scales, we simply employ the\nRoelof and Sibeck (1993) model subsolar magnetopause\nposition for IMF Bz \u00bb 0 nT which is valid for a typical\ndynamic pressure of 2 nPa (a value of \u001810.8 RE), and\nthen scale this value according to the usual one sixth\npower law of p. The parameterisation of the subsolar\nmagnetopause position RMP thus employed is\nRMP \u0088 12:1\np\u0085nPa\u00861=6\n\u0088 111\n\u0089n\u0085cm\u00ff3\u0086V 2\u0085km s\u00ff1\u0086\u008a1=6\nRE : \u00851\u0086\nThis formula is in good overall accord with the Roelof\nand Sibeck model for |Bz| not too large, and is also in\nreasonable agreement with the model results of Petrinec\nand Russell (1993).\nUsing this value, the distance to the subsolar bow\nshock can then be determined, using the results of the\nempirical study by Peredo et al. (1995). From a\ncomprehensive analysis of observed shock locations\nthese authors found that the subsolar shock is typically\nlocated at a distance which is larger than that of the\nsubsolar magnetopause by a factor of 1.46. We thus\nparametrise the subsolar shock location as\nRBS \u0088 17:6\u0089p\u0085nPa\u0086\u008a1=6\n\u0088 162\n\u0089n\u0085cm\u00ff3\u0086V 2\u0085km s\u00ff1\u0086\u008a1=6\nRE : \u00852\u0086\nWe now require a model of the flow speed between\nthe subsolar shock and magnetopause, and simply take\na linear variation from a value of VBS just downstream\nfrom the shock and VMP at the magnetopause. Integra-\ntion of (ds\/V) between RBS and RMP then yields the\nfrozen-in propagation time across the subsolar magne-\ntosheath as\nssh \u0088 RBS \u00ff RMP\u0085 \u0086VBS \u00ff VMP ln\nVBS\nVMP\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0088 0:46RMP\nVBS \u00ff VMP ln\nVBS\nVMP\n: \u00853\u0086\nWe finally require values for VBS and VMP. The usual\nshock jump conditions determine VBS in terms of the\nupstream speed VSW as\nVBS\nVSW\n\u0088 c\u00ff 1\u0085 \u0086M\n2 \u0087 2\nc\u0087 1\u0085 \u0086M2 ; \u00854\u0086\nwhereM is themagnetosonicMach number and c = 5\/3.\nSubstituting an average value ofM = 5.3 (Peredo et al.,\n1995) into Eq. (4) gives (VBS\/VSW) \u00bb 0.28, and this is the\nvalue for VBS which we adopt here. The reconnection-\nassociated velocity of inflow at the magnetopause, VMP,\nmust be taken to be a finite value to avoid the\nlogarithmic singularity in Eq. (3), and we assume a\nnominal value of 20 km s)1. Taken together with\nreasonable values for the magnetosheath field at the\nmagnetopause of a few tens of nT, and reasonable\nlengths for the reconnection line of several RE, this value\nimplies reasonable reconnection-driven convection volt-\nages of several tens of kV. However, our results are not\nsensitive to the exact choice. Substituting these values\ninto Eq. (3) finally yields\nssh \u0088 1:66RMPVSW \u00ff 72\u0085 \u0086 ln\nVSW\n72\n\u0012 \u0013\n; \u00855\u0086\nwhere VSW is in km s\n)1, and RMP is in km, determined\nfrom Eq. (1) with RE = 6375 km. Thus ssh is deter-\nmined directly in terms of the density and velocity of the\nupstream solar wind plasma.\nWe finally note that if Eq. (5) is interpreted as the\nmagnetosheath thickness of 0.46 RMP divided by an\n\u2018\u2018average\u2019\u2019 magnetosheath speed hVshi, then for typical\nvalues of VSW \u0018 500 km s)1 we find hVshi \u0019 \u0085VSW =8\u0086.\nOur formula therefore produces a final value which is\n1332 H. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention\nvery similar to that obtained by simply dividing the\nsubsolar magnetosheath thickness by an average mag-\nnetosheath speed which assumes a jump by a factor of\n4 at the shock and a linear decrease to zero at the\nmagnetopause, as employed in previous studies (e.g.\nLester et al., 1993).\nAlfve\u00b4nic propagation from the magnetopause\nto the cusp ionosphere\nOnce reconnection occurs at the dayside magnetopause,\nits e\u0080ects on the flow are transmitted along the newly-\nopened field lines by an Alfve\u00b4n wave. The transit time\nfrom the subsolar magnetopause to the ionosphere can\nthen be determined as approximately one quarter of the\nperiod of fundamental mode eigenoscillations of the\nouter dayside field lines. Since these periods are typically\nfound to lie in the range 5\u201310 min (e.g. Poulter et al.,\n1984), we have taken the magnetopause-to-ionosphere\ntransit time to be 2 min.\nApplication to the present study\nWe finally describe how the methods outlined have\nbeen applied in the present study. For purposes of\nthe cross-correlation analysis we require one represen-\ntative IMF delay time corresponding to 2-h segments\nof radar data. To obtain this delay we first scanned the\ncorresponding IMF data for sharp field changes to\ndetermine the orientation of the phase fronts in the\nfield, as described. Using each orientation so deter-\nmined, we then calculated the total delay time as a\nfunction of UT over the 2-h interval, using the\nmeasured solar wind density and velocity values to\ndetermine the subsolar shock position according to Eq.\n(2) and the magnetosheath transit time from Eqs. (1)\nand (5). The \u2018\u2018delay\u2019\u2019 time series was then averaged\nover the whole interval to provide a single averaged\ndelay time determined from that phase front orienta-\ntion (typically the variation of the delay time over such\nintervals is \u00181 min or less). This procedure was then\nrepeated for each phase front orientation determined\nduring the interval (typically 2\u20136), yielding a set of\naveraged delay times. Normally these proved to be\nmutually consistent within 1\u20132 min. A representative\ndelay time value was then chosen for the interval, and\n2 min-averaged IMF vectors were derived from the\n15 s values, corresponding to the 2 min averaged radar\nvalues with the representative propagation delay re-\nmoved. These averaged IMF values were then used for\nthe cross-correlation analysis. Essentially the same\nprocedures were used for the event study, except that\nthe orientation of the phase front of the particular\nIMF \u2018\u2018event\u2019\u2019 in question was used as the basis of the\naveraged delay time estimate, and the average was\ntaken over the same 10\u201315 min intervals on either side\nof the discontinuity as were used to determine the\ndirection of the discontinuity normal.\nUncertainty estimates\nWe finally consider the likely level of the random and\nsystematic errors in our propagation delay determina-\ntions. The first source of uncertainty arises from our\ndeterminations of the IMF \u2018\u2018phase front\u2019\u2019 orientations in\nthe interplanetary medium, together with the variations\nof this orientation and of the speed of the solar wind\nover the \u00182 h intervals employed in this study. As\nindicated, changes in the solar wind speed over such\nintervals typically produce variations in the estimated\npropagation delay of \u00181 min or less for a fixed \u2018\u2018phase\nfront\u2019\u2019 orientation, and analysis of several \u2018\u2018phase\nfronts\u2019\u2019 in a particular interval generally provide con-\nsistent results within \u00181\u20132 min. These uncertainties\ncontribute to a random error in the propagation delay\nvalues which we thus estimate to be about \u008b1 min. This\nestimate is somewhat smaller than would be inferred\nfrom the recent results of Ridley et al. (1998) and Collier\net al. (1998), both of whom undertook IMF propaga-\ntion studies between spacecraft widely separated in the\nsolar wind (in particular WIND and IMP-8). The\nrandom timing errors determined in these studies are\nof order \u0006dperp=VSW , where dperp is the separation of the\nobserving points in the plane perpendicular to the\nEarth-Sun line. The corresponding distance in our case\nis the perpendicular distance of IMP-8 from the Earth-\nSun line, which we may take typically to be \u001820 RE. The\nuncertainty in the spacecraft to subsolar bow shock\npropagation time would then be \u0018\u008b4 min in values\nwhich range typically between 2 and 8 min, compared\nwith the \u008b1 min which we estimated on the basis\ndescribed earlier. The meaning of an error of order\n\u0006dperp=VSW is that the orientation of the \u2018\u2018phase fronts\u2019\u2019\nof the IMF variations is essentially undetermined; its\nliteral meaning is that the normal may lie anywhere\nwithin a cone of angles \u008b45\u00b0 about the Earth-Sun line.\nHowever, our analysis indicates that the \u2018\u2018phase fronts\u2019\u2019\nassociated with the large changes in IMF Bz which are of\nspecial significance in this study are rather more\norganised in direction than this, and lie typically near\nthe equatorial plane orthogonal to the garden-hose\ndirection, as previously indicated. Thus when several\ndiscontinuities are analysed in a particular interval, the\nvariation in \u2018\u2018phase front\u2019\u2019 orientation typically produc-\nes a variation in the estimated propagation time of\n\u0018\u008b1 min as indicated, rather than the \u0018\u008b4 min that\nwould be expected on the basis of the analysis of more\ngeneral variations in the IMF presented by Collier et al.\n(1998). For the circumstances of the present study,\ntherefore, the smaller value appears more appropriate.\nThe second source of uncertainty lies in the modelled\npositions of the bow shock and magnetopause, and\nmore particularly the distance between them, and in the\nmagnetosheath flow model employed. As indicated, the\nmodels of the bow shock and magnetopause positions\nwe have employed are based on the results of recent\nstatistical studies incorporating large numbers of posi-\ntional observations, while the model of the subsolar\nmagnetosheath flow is based on shock jump conditions\nand the results of gas-dynamic models. It therefore\nH. Khan and S. W. H. Cowley: Observations of the response time of high-latitude ionospheric convention 1333\nseems that large systematic uncertainties are unlikely.\nTypically, the thickness of the subsolar magnetosheath\ndetermined from these models is 4\u20135 RE, and judging\nfrom the scatter in the positional data in the statistical\nstudies cited, the uncertainty in this value is probably\naround 10%, i.e. about \u008b0.5 RE. Equation (3) then\nyields a likely random error in the magnetosheath\npropagation delay of less than \u008b1 min. The systematic\nerror seems unlikely to be larger than this. The third\nsource of potential error arises from the Alfve\u00b4nic\npropagation of information from the magnetopause to\nthe cusp ionosphere, taken to be 2 min on the basis of\nthe measured periods of ULF waves on outer dayside\nfield lines. Based also on the variability of the latter, we\nestimate that the random and systematic error of this\npropagation time is \u008b1 min. Taken together, therefore,\nand recognising the uncorrelated nature of the separate\ncontributions to the uncertainties involved, we estimate\nthe random error in our calculated propagation delays\nto be about \u008b2 min (in a total which lies typically in the\nrange 5\u201315 min), while the systematic error is likely to\nbe comparable with this or smaller. We note that our\nestimate of the random error is consistent with the\ndegree of scatter observed in our results, such as that in\nthe \u2018\u2018event study\u2019\u2019 displayed in Fig. 7.\nReferences\nBaker, D.
