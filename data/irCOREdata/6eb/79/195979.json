Introduction \nThe class trip to a museum or gallery1 is a long-established activity for many schools. Although \nmuseums have been conducting classes, delivering lectures, and designing special programmes for \nschools for over a century (Hein 1998), it is only in recent decades that museums have received \nrecognition for their value to formal education (Black 2005). The UK National Curriculum \nemphasises the \u201cdirect use by pupils of a range of sources of evidence [where] museums and \nheritage sites [are] seen as a readily accessible means of delivery\u201d (Black 2005:157). \nMuseum visits can expose students to subject-matter that cannot be effectively covered in the \nclassroom, introduce them to resources in their community, and provide a varied social experience \n(Anderson & Zhang 2003; Kisiel 2005; Rennie & McClafferty 1995; Storksdieck 2006). \nFurthermore, museum visits are memorable events for the students, allowing the teacher to call \nupon them later in appropriate learning situations (Rennie & McClafferty 1995). Museum visits can \noffer rich learning experiences facilitated by authentic objects and structured into inquiry-led \nlearning. The museum can be a place to learn across curriculum topic areas (DCMS & DfEE 2000) \nin an engaging environment (Johnsson 2003). \n                                                 \n1 The term \u2018museum\u2019 is used throughout this paper to cover museums, galleries and related cultural institutions \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 2 \n1.1 Inquiry learning \nInquiry learning is \u201can educational activity in which students \u2026 investigate a set of phenomena \u2013 \nvirtual or real \u2013 and draw conclusions about it. Students direct their own investigatory activity, but \nthey may be prompted to formulate questions, plan their activity, and draw and justify conclusions \nabout what they have learned\u201d (Kuhn, Black, Keselman & Kaplan 2000:496-7).  \nInquiry learning is a potentially effective strategy when supported appropriately (Chinn & Malhotra \n2002; White & Frederiksen 1998). The museum visit is an ideal context for learning by inquiry \n(McLeod & Kilpatrick 2001), allowing the student freedom to explore the environment within the \nconstraints of pre-existing learning aims. The typical layout of rooms into themes, the mix of media, \nopportunities for \u2018hands-on\u2019 exploration, display of rich and authentic objects, and limited \nguidance, all support a learning approach of active inquiry and engagement.  \n1.2 Learning on school visits to museums \nMuch of the research on learning in museums focuses on measuring knowledge gains, however \nresults are inconclusive: although students usually find visits enjoyable, the amount and nature of \ntheir cognitive learning vary (Griffin 2004). This is not surprising, as knowledge gains are hard to \nachieve during a short visit in an unfamiliar context (Donald 1991) and the main conceptual gains \nof such visits appear to be in consolidating and reinforcing previous knowledge and understandings, \nrather than acquiring new knowledge (Falk 2004).  \nLearning in museums extends beyond cognitive gains, with research emphasising attitudinal, \naffective and social outcomes (Falk, Scott, Dierking, Rennie & Cohen-Jones 2004; Jarvis & Pell \n2005; Rennie & McClafferty 1996). Donald (1991) provides a critique of the focus on cognitive \ngains at the expense of affective or attitudinal outcomes: \u201ceducators have concentrated so hard on \nthe acquisition of knowledge and abilities \u2026 that their austere description of learning has no place \nfor pleasure or wonder\u201d (p.378).  \nThus, in the context of inquiry-based learning discussed earlier, a successful outcome of a school \nmuseum visit is an enjoyable experience that cultivates positive attitudes towards the museum and \nits subject-matter. On leaving the museum, students take away topic knowledge, but also new ideas \nand enthusiasm to continue their inquiry outside the walls of the museum, giving the teacher a solid \nplatform on which to base post-visit school work. \n1.3 Museum learning outside the museum \nResearch suggests that repeat school museum visits are more effective than one-off visits (Hooper-\nGreenhill, Dodd, Creaser, Sandell, Jones & Woodham 2007; Hooper-Greenhill, Dodd, Gibson, \nPhillips, Jones & Sullivan 2006). The Queensland University of Technology\u2019s \u2018Museum \nCollaboratives Manual\u2019 (Piscitelli, Everett & Weier 2003) proposes \u2018Excursion Plus\u2019 programmes, \ni.e. visits that are enhanced through a number of pre- and post-visit activities.  \nPre-visit preparation \u201cimproves the chances of learning especially if it involves integration of the \nschool and museum learning and provides opportunities for student involvement\u201d (Griffin \n2004:S60). Pre-visit preparation includes the students\u2019 cognitive, psychological and spatial \norientation to the museum (Bitgood, Serrell & Thompson 1994; Falk & Dierking 2000). In addition, \npreparation can inform students about the practical arrangements for the day and train them in the \npractical skills they will need, such as taking notes while standing (Talboys 1996). \nPost-visit activities are of equal importance. Anderson and colleagues (Anderson, Lucas & Ginns \n2003; Anderson, Lucas, Ginns & Dierking 2000) found that post-visit classroom activities add \nvalue by helping students assimilate newly learnt concepts and resolve possible misconceptions. \u201cIt \nis only as events unfold for the individual after the museum visit that experiences that occurred \ninside the institution become relevant and useful\u201d (Falk & Dierking 2000:128). \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 3 \nThus, a school museum visit will preferably include a pre-visit lesson where questions are \nformulated, continue during the visit with the collection of evidence and information, and conclude \npost-visit with interpretation of evidence and drawing of conclusions: \u201c\u2026making the links between \nschool and museum learning explicit, genuine, and continuous affords real opportunities for school \nstudents to have enjoyable learning experiences in both settings\u201d (Griffin 2004:S67). \n1.4 Technology-enhanced museum learning \nThe last decade has seen increased research into the use of digital, mobile tools to support school \nmuseum visits. Moving beyond the audio or multimedia museum guide (e.g. Abowd, Atkeson, \nHong, Long, Kooper & Pinkerton 1997), these tools facilitate inquiry activities in the museum such \nas exploration, information search, communication, and experience documenting (Hsi 2002). While \na number of mobile learning applications have been proposed (see for example Cabrera, Frutos, \nStoica, Avouris, Dimitriadis, Fiotakis et al. 2005; Galani, Chalmers, Brown, MacColl, Randell & \nSteed 2003; Hsi & Fait 2005; Mulholland, Collins & Zdrahal 2005; O\u2019Hara, Kindberg, Glancy, \nBaptista, Sukumaran, Kahana et al. 2007; Papadimitriou, Komis, Tselios & Avouris 2006), none \nhave been designed to support activities that span pre-, during- and post-visit learning in the \nmuseum and the classroom. \n1.5 Myartspace evaluation aims \nThis paper describes our evaluation of Myartspace, a mobile service that supports learning in the \nmuseum and connects it with learning in the classroom. The design of Myartspace arose from an \ninitial proposal by a multimedia company to a UK funding agency to develop mobile phone and \nweb technology to support school visits to museums and galleries2. The aim of the service is to \nsupport a process of inquiry learning, beginning with goal-setting at school, followed by \n\u2018collection\u2019 and annotation of artefacts in the museums during a school visit. The visit is then \nfollowed by synthesis back at school (or during homework) and then presentation and sharing of \nwhat students have learned and created. \nWe present the results of our evaluation of Myartspace at three pilot sites. The aim of the evaluation \nis to examine the effectiveness of the service for enhancing learning between classrooms and \nmuseums. \nSection 2 of this paper describes the Myartspace service, section 3 outlines the evaluation \nframework and methods and section 4 presents the evaluation results. The paper concludes with a \ndiscussion of the results and their implications for future systems. \n2.  Overview of Myartspace \nMyartspace is a service that uses both mobile phones and a website to support inquiry learning \nbetween classrooms and museums. Development started in April 2005 and trials were conducted in \nthree UK museums from February 2006 to March 2007. During this period over 3000 children \nengaged with the service. Myartspace combines interactions in three spaces: the physical space of \nthe museum and classroom, the personal space that students create on their mobile phones and \npersonal computers (PCs), and the virtual space containing \u2018collected\u2019 artefacts, in the form of \nonline \u2018stores\u2019 and \u2018galleries\u2019. \nThe recommended mode of use includes three lessons, preceded by customisation of each lesson by \nthe teacher. Participating teachers receive a Teacher\u2019s Pack and Lesson Plans, specific to the \n                                                 \n2 Myartspace was designed and developed by The SEA (www.the-sea.com), while the user experience and educational \nevaluation was carried out by the authors of this paper, in parallel with internal testing carried out by the developers. \nBoth development and evaluation activities were funded by Culture Online, then part of the UK Department for Culture, \nMedia and Sport.  \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 4 \nmuseum. The Lesson Plans contain ideas for designing pre-, on- and post-visit lessons related to \nthat museum. Teachers are however free to customise and use the service as they wish, to suit their \nteaching practices and the specific needs of their students.  \nDuring the pre-visit lesson the teacher explains the concept of \u2018collecting\u2019, introduces the museum, \nsets the students one or more inquiry questions, and optionally allows the students hands-on \nexperience with the Myartspace website. The students\u2019 task is then to investigate the inquiry \nquestion during their museum visit, by using the phone to collect relevant evidence and information, \nthen use these during a post-visit lesson to create a \u2018personal gallery\u2019 on the Myartspace web site. \nFor example, students on a school visit to the D-Day museum were set the question: \u201cWas D-Day a \ntriumph or disaster for Britain?\u201d \nThe website hosts three repositories of digital objects: a museum \u2018store\u2019 (maintained by the \nmuseum), a class \u2018store\u2019 (maintained by the teacher and students), and personal student and teacher \n\u2018stores\u2019 (maintained by each individual user). It also hosts personal student and teacher \u2018galleries\u2019, \nwhich are ordered collections of digital objects similar in style to a Powerpoint\u00ae presentation that \nusers create by selecting objects in their personal store and defining a sequence in which they will \nbe presented. Although users have no access to each other\u2019s stores, they can view each other\u2019s \ngalleries. All content in personal galleries is automatically made available in the class store, where \nall users can access and use it (see Figure 1).  \nThe content of the museum store is provided by the museum and comprises digital content such as \nphotos, illustrations, and text representing physical museum objects and exhibits. Decisions over \nhow much and what museum content to digitise were guided by the need to have enough curated \ncontent to support a wide range of learning tasks. Input came from all stakeholders (developers, \nfunding body, educational consultants) and agreed targets were negotiated with individual museums \nas part of their contractual agreement. The museums involved in the pilot either had no available \ndigitised content at all; or where digital content existed it was not appropriate for the target age \ngroups. The task was seen by museum staff as an extension of their curatorial and archival services.  \nA content specification and style guide was developed by the project team to ensure content quality \nand suitability for the audience. The digitisation was carried out by the museums\u2019 educational and \ncuratorial teams. The process involved the selection of objects to digitise, taking of digital \nphotographs, and writing of textual information3.  Digital content was then imported into the \nmuseum store (content database) using a bulk upload facility and a spreadsheet that enabled the \nassociation of different items so as to create multimedia museum objects. After upload, all the \nobjects could be edited and updated by museum staff as required. The process took place over the \ndesign and implementation phases of the project. \nBefore the museum visit, the museum store is available only to the teacher, who can select some of \nthat content to copy into their personal store and publish it in their gallery. This will make the \nselected content available to the students through the class store for the pre-visit lesson. Students \ncan fill their (initially empty) personal stores with digital content as the lessons progress, while their \nobjective throughout the lessons focuses on the creation of a personal gallery to demonstrate their \nwork on the learning task.  \n \n                                                 \n3 The ability to associate audio content with all objects has now been added to the system, enabling the delivery \nof streaming audio. \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 5 \n \n \nFigure 1: Organisation of stores and galleries in Myartspace. Solid lines indicate deliberate copy of \ncontent by users and dashed lines indicate automatic copy of content by the service. Users can copy \ncontent deliberately (a) from the museum \/ class stores into their personal (student\/teacher) store \n(lines d1, d3), and (b) while publishing (copying) content from their personal store into their \npersonal gallery (line d2). Automatic copy of content takes place (a) from the mobile phone in the \nmuseum onto the user\u2019s personal store (line a1) and (b) from the user\u2019s personal gallery onto the \nclass store (line a2). The class store is initially empty; it is automatically populated as users copy \nitems from their personal stores onto their personal galleries. The museum store is a repository \navailable throughout the lessons and its content cannot be altered or added to by the users. Users \ncan view each other\u2019s galleries but cannot copy content directly from them and have no access to \neach other\u2019s stores. \n \nThe Myartspace experience is: \n\u2022 Prior to the lessons, the teacher may create a teacher\u2019s gallery using objects in the museum \nstore, both as an example to students of a gallery and to familiarise themselves with the web \n \nMuseum \nStore \n \nClass \nStore \nStudent \nStore \nStudent\nStore \nStudent\nGallery\nStudent\nGallery\nTeacher\nStore \nTeacher\nGallery\nd1 \nd1\nd1 \nd2 d2\nd2\nd3\nd3\nd3\na1 a1 \na2\na2\na2\n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 6 \nsite. Content displayed in the teacher\u2019s gallery is made available in the class store and \nstudents can select and copy objects from it into their personal store during the pre-visit \nlesson. Students, however, have no access to the museum store in the pre-visit lesson. \n\u2022 During the visit, students are loaned a Nokia 6680 multimedia mobile phone, with the \nMyartspace service pre-loaded as a Java application. The phone is locked into running the \nservice and cannot be used for other functions (such as making calls). They may create new \ncontent by using the phone to take photos, record sound and input text (see Figure 2). They \nmay also \u2018collect\u2019 objects from the museum store by typing in a two-letter code displayed on \na label next to the exhibit. Having collected an item they are prompted to type in the reason \nwhy they have chosen to collect it. They can also select to view the usernames of other \npeople who have collected that object. All the content they capture is automatically sent by \nGPRS from the phone to their personal store on the Myartspace website; \n\u2022 In the post-visit lesson, students can access their personal store on the website and copy into \nit objects from (a) the museum store, to which they now have full access, and (b) the class \nstore (which contains items held in other students\u2019 galleries). Their task is to create personal \ngalleries. This is the culmination of the inquiry, where students review, enrich and synthesise \ntheir evidence to answer the inquiry question. At the end of the post-visit lesson the students \ncan present their galleries in the classroom or share them with friends and family outside \nschool (some schools have organised parents\u2019 evenings where these galleries are presented) \nusing the Myartspace website (see Figure 3), access to which is password protected and the \ncontent moderated to ensure privacy protection and appropriate use. \n \nThe Study Gallery\n  \nWire, thread, fabric, acrylic \npaint and mosaic on a \nwood construction in cloud\nCloud Factory\n \nCloud Factory\u2019 was \ninspired by a fragment of \n16th century lace collar. \nCan you see how this \n'lacy' structure has been \nput together?\n \n(a)                                   (b)                                   (c)                                  (d) \n \nFigure 2: Myartspace interface: (a) Initial screen, (b) main menu, (c, d) interfaces for collecting an \nexhibit \n \n \n \nFigure 3: An example student gallery \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 7 \n3.  Evaluating Myartspace: methodology and methods \n3.1 The M3 evaluation framework \nThe evaluation was based on the Lifecycle approach (Meek 2006), which places evaluation at the \ncentre of the technology development process, from the very early stages of design to the final \nassessment of the technology in a learning context. Similarly, the Myartspace evaluation took place \nthroughout the course of the project: from conception, through design and implementation, to \ndeployment. The main intention was to evaluate the potential and effectiveness of the Myartspace \nservice to enhance learning between classrooms and museums. The M3 evaluation framework \n(Vavoula & Sharples 2009) was used. M3 comprises three levels: \nMicro level: examines the individual activities of the technology users and assesses usability and \nutility. In the case of Myartspace the activities included collecting objects through exhibit codes, \nmaking notes, contacting people who have collected a particular item, recording audio, and \ntaking pictures. \nMeso level: examines the learning experience as a whole, to identify learning breakthroughs and \nbreakdowns; it also examines how well the learning experience integrates with other related \nlearning experiences. In the case of Myartspace, evaluation at this level involved exploring \nwhether there was a successful connection between learning in the museum and in the classroom \nas well as identifying critical incidents that reveal new patterns and forms of learning or where \nlearning activity is impeded.  \nMacro level: examines the longer term impact of the new technology on established educational \nand learning practice. For Myartspace this related to the organisation of school museum visits. \nThe evaluation at this level looked, for example, at the appropriation of the new technology by \nteachers, the emergence of new museum practices in supporting school visits, and how they \nrelated to the original project visions. \nTo establish the value of the service at each level, the evaluation explores the gap between \nexpectations and reality and also unforeseen processes and outcomes. This takes place in two stages \nof data collection followed by one stage of analysis: \nStage 1: collect data about what is supposed to happen at a level \u2013 user expectations are captured \nthrough interviews with users (teachers, students and museum staff) and by analysing user \ndocumentation, training sessions and materials \nStage 2: collect data about what actually happened at a level \u2013 observations, video and audio \nrecordings substantiate the reality of technology use for the different users.  \nStage 3: examine the gaps between user expectations and reality through a combination of \nreflective interviews with users and critical analysis of the data collected in stages 1 and 2. \nThe development of Myartspace comprised four broad phases: (1) Requirements analysis, to \nestablish the requirements for the socio-technical system (the users and their interactions with \ntechnology) and specify how it would work, through consultation with the different stakeholder \ngroups; (2) Design of the user experience and interface; (3) Implementation of the service; and (4) \nDeployment of the service. These are compatible with an Agile Development approach (Beck, \nBeedle, van Bennekum, Cockburn, Cunningham, Fowler et al. 2001) where requirements can \nevolve throughout the development process to take account of the evaluations of usability, learning \neffectiveness and institutional adoption. Thus, the requirements analysis persisted throughout the \nproject lifecycle, and covered all three levels of analysis (micro, meso and macro).  \nFigure 4 illustrates the gradual introduction of evaluation activities at the three framework levels \nover all project phases. The horizontal axis in Figure 4 depicts time; the change of focus \ndevelopment phase over time is shown, as is the persistence of requirements analysis throughout the \nproject lifecycle. The shaded areas represent activities for requirements analysis (dark grey) and \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 8 \nevaluation at the three levels during design, implementation and deployment (all other shades). \nNote that the figure is not intended to indicate the relative durations of the project phases, only the \nsequence in which they came into focus. \nThe emphasis on level of requirements analysis changes during the development process. At the \nstart of a project, the requirements analysis must take account of all levels to set initial requirements \nfor an educational experience that integrates technology, effective learning and institutional support. \nAs the project progresses, the technology matures so that changes to requirements become focused \non the learning context and institutional adoption. At the end of the project, the requirements have \nbeen finalised and are evaluated at all levels. \n \nFigure 4: Requirements analysis and evaluation activities at the three levels over the project phases. \n \nThe emphasis on level of evaluation also changes during the development process. Early \nevaluations at micro level inform the user interface and human-technology interactions. Once the \ntechnology is robust enough to allow assessment of educational value, evaluation activities at the \nmeso level are introduced during the implementation phase. Similarly, the macro level requires that \nthe technology is in place and used for long enough to establish its effects on e.g. school museum \nvisiting practice, so evaluation activities at the macro level may be introduced during the \ndeployment phase. \n3.2 Evaluation activities and methods \nThe evaluation team comprised the authors of this paper, and was independent of the development \nteam. The evaluation took place throughout the project lifecycle, from April 2005 to March 2007, \nand was planned as a continuous, formative and informative activity rather than a final \u2018success or \nfailure\u2019 test. Three test sites were involved: the Study Gallery in Poole, the Urbis museum of urban \nlife in Manchester, and the D-Day museum in Portsmouth. \nThe evaluation framework presented in section 3.1 guided the design of requirements analysis and \nevaluation activities and the selection of methods. Evaluation began with a series of scoping studies \nand consultation workshops to establish the educational and user requirements for the service. \nDuring the design, evaluation was concerned with the micro level, focussing on usability. The main \nMacro \nevaluation \n \n \nMeso \nevaluation \n \n \n \nMicro \nevaluation \nTechnology robust enough for \nevaluation of learning  \nService deployed long \nenough to assess impact\nSpecify requirements \nDesign \nImplement\nDeploy \nProject development process \n Article published in Computers & Education \nDOI: 10.1016\/j.compedu.2009.02.007 \n Page 9 \ntechnique used was Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen & Molich 1990), carried out on low-fidelity, \npaper prototypes. These evaluation activities continued into the implementation phase. As more \nrobust functional prototypes became available, into the first part of the implementation phase, \nevaluation at the meso level was added, up to full-scale user trials with user observations, \ninterviews, focus groups and questionnaires. Such user trials continued into the deployment phase. \nLater into the deployment phase summative evaluations took place, where the macro level was also \nintroduced, including stakeholder interviews and surveys. Table 1 summarises the evaluation \ntechniques used at the three levels and the associated three-stage data collection and analysis. \nAs shown in Table 1, multiple methods were used, including interviews, observations, \nquestionnaires, and expert reviews. Interviewing included one-to-one semi-structured interviews \nwith teachers and museum educators, and focus groups with students. Observations were facilitated \nby paper-based reporting sheets and videos of the student focus groups, the teachers, and the \nmuseum educators during all lessons, where observers were asked to focus on key areas, e.g. \n\u201cdescribe how the teacher introduces the learning task\u201d. Questionnaires incorporating both open and \nclosed questions were administered to students in paper format before and after each lesson, and to \nMyartspace teachers in the form of an online survey. Expert reviews in the form of Heuristic \nEvaluations were carried out on paper and functional prototypes. \nThe mixed-methods approach enabled triangulation. For example, data collected through teacher \ninterviews before a lesson were checked against data collected during teacher observations for that \nlesson and post-lesson interviews with teacher and students; outcomes of Heuristic Evaluations \nwere tested during full-scale user trials; and data collected during full-scale trials were compared \nagainst interviews with teachers who had not participated in the trials.  \nThe data analysis was guided by the M3 framework presented above and employed Grounded \nTheory (Glaser & Strauss 1967) and the Critical Incident method (Flanagan 1954). We used an \nadaptation of the Critical Incidents method to analyse the students\u2019 experience in the museum. \nRight after the visit, the evaluators watched videotapes of a student group to identify observable \ncritical incidents that appear to be breakthroughs (indicating productive new forms of learning or \nimportant conceptual change) or breakdowns (where a learner is struggling with the technology, is \nasking for help, or appears to be labouring under a clear misunderstanding). These incidents were \nthen assembled into a compilation tape and were reviewed with the students for further elaboration. \nOpen coding was applied to data collected through different sources in stages 1 (expectations) and 2 \n(reality), to extract key themes and emerging issues pertinent to the micro, meso, and macro levels. \nSources of data included interview transcripts, observation sheets, video recordings, questionnaires, \nheuristic evaluation reports, and the outcomes of the critical incident analysis. Issues emerging from \nstage 1 (expectations) were mapped onto issues from stage 2 (reality), enabling us to identify gaps \nbetween expectations and reality.  \n4.  Myartspace evaluation results \nIn this section we summarise the evaluation results of the final full-scale user trial in November \n2006, conducted at the D-Day museum in Portsmouth, UK (which commemorates and interprets the \n1944 Normandy Allied landings).

A pre-visit lesson \ntook place at school on Friday, November 3rd. During the lesson the teacher introduced the topic of \nD-Day to students, along with sets of questions that students would work with in the museum, each \nset dealing with a D-Day issue (e.g. \u201cLife at the home front\u201d). No history modules relevant to D-\nDay were planned in that school at that time of year, so the teacher had to introduce D-Day out-of-\norder, specifically for the Myartspace visit. Students were divided into self-selected groups of three \nwith each group assigned a set of questions to work on. Students were then told that in the museum \nthey would use Myartspace to collect objects, take pictures and record sounds related to the \nquestions on their worksheet. The teacher demonstrated Myartspace galleries and introduced the \nconcept of \u2018collecting\u2019 to students through additional source work. \nThe museum visit lesson took place the following Monday. Students arrived at the museum with \ntheir sets of questions on paper. The museum Education Officer gave them an introduction to \nMyartspace, explaining how the phones worked and what they could do with them. Students were \ngiven one phone each and told to explore the museum in their groups, collecting items relevant to \ntheir set questions. The Myartspace web site was not shown. \nThe post-visit lesson took place on the next day. Students worked individually at a PC to create \npersonal galleries. The teacher and the classroom assistant walked around the room helping \nstudents. \nOur evaluation activities took place before, during and after each of the three lessons. The teacher \nchose two groups of three students for the focus group interviews: one group of girls and one of \nboys. Each group was interviewed after each lesson, and were followed closely and recorded on \nvideo in the museum. The footage from the girls\u2019 museum tour was reviewed by the evaluators after \nthe museum visit to create a video-diary of incidents we considered important to the evaluation. The \ngirls\u2019 group was then shown that diary in the interview following the post-visit lesson and was \nasked to describe the incidents. In addition, questionnaires were distributed to the whole class after \neach lesson. The teacher was interviewed before and after all three lessons. The museum Education \nOfficer was also interviewed in a more general reflection on the Myartspace service that the \nmuseum had been running from February to November 2006. \nThe findings from the three lessons are described below at the micro and meso levels. The analysis \nhas highlighted the significance of preparation work, mainly on behalf of the teacher but also the \nmuseum, which takes place before the three lessons. Thus, findings relating to this preparation work \nbefore the lessons are described separately. Finally, findings at the macro level are described. \n4.2 Myartspace \u2013 before the lessons \nNo teaching unit relevant to the D-Day is taught at this school at the time of year when the study \ntook place, so the teacher ran an introductory lesson on the D-Day landings prior to the pre-visit \nlesson.  \nThe Teacher\u2019s Pack steps through the Myartspace process, including registering students, pre-visit \nlesson, visit to the museum, and post-visit lesson. However, it does not describe the functionality of \neither the website or the phones, or what the students can do with them. The main additional \nsources of information about the service were members of staff at the museum who deliver hands-\non taster sessions; and the Myartspace web site. \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 12 \nMyartspace venues encourage teachers to visit the museum themselves before they come with their \nclass. However, practical limitations often prevent this. This problem is not specific to Myartspace: \n\u201cthis is not a new problem \u2026 teachers don\u2019t normally attend the museum before a visit, though it \nwould be beneficial if they did.\u201d (Interview, Education Officer). Nor is it specific to this museum, \nas other studies suggest (Anderson & Zhang 2003; Finkelstein 2005; Fisher 2001; Johnsson 2003; \nKisiel 2003; Michie 1998; Storksdieck 2001). \n4.2.1 Before the lessons \u2013 micro level \nTeacher and students have access to an online general help page on the website which contains \ninstructions for each task a user can perform (create gallery, view\/copy from stores, etc.). However, \nno detailed, dedicated set of instructions (e.g. a manual) is provided, nor is there context-specific \nhelp (i.e. the help button only takes the user to the above mentioned general help page). Similarly, \nthere is no online guide on how to use the Myartspace phones. These were conscious design \ndecisions, aiming at designing a service that is easy to \u2018pick up and go\u2019 without the need for lengthy \ntutorials and manuals. Although the need for support materials was identified in previous \nevaluations, design efforts had instead focused on further simplifying the user interface. \nThe teacher in this particular study had used Myartspace previously, which provided her with first-\nhand knowledge of the functionality of the phones and the website. Other teachers surveyed \nindicated that training sessions at the museum did not cover the use of the website in full, leaving \nthem uncertain as to how to use it back in their classrooms. Thus, although the teacher in this trial \nknew what to expect at each Myartspace lesson in terms of service functionality, the same cannot be \nassumed for the typical teacher.  \n4.2.2 Before the lessons \u2013 meso level \nAt the interview before the pre-visit lesson the teacher indicated that the students in general had \nenjoyed previous visits to museums, but that these consisted of filling in a prepared worksheet. The \nmuseum Education Officer, too, thought that worksheets were not adequate to support school visits: \n\u201cThe museum had a lack of resources to support secondary school age children. Myartspace was a \nway of attracting secondary schools into the museum\u201d. \n4.3 The pre-visit lesson \nDuring the lesson the teacher demonstrated the website and an example gallery on a class screen, \nusing one of the galleries from her pervious visit as an example, showing pictures and collected \nobjects and playing voice recordings, to introduce the capabilities of Myartspace. Emphasis was \nplaced on the option to collect photos and voice recordings. The teacher explained the Myartspace \nprocess and phones to the students. Students were not allowed time to have hands-on experience of \nthe website. \nThe D-Day topic was introduced. Different groups of students were given different handouts, each \ncontaining several questions, on an inquiry topic, such as \u201chow did people respond to outbreak of \nwar?\u201d and \u201cwould we respond in the same way?\u201d \nThe students were then asked to perform source work, looking at printed sources (photos and text) \nrelevant to their group\u2019s worksheet and filling in a \u201cwho-what-why-when-where\u201d sheet for them. \nThey were told that their job in the museum was to carefully select relevant objects to collect, just \nas a curator of a museum would do. \n4.3.1 The pre-visit lesson \u2013 micro level \nThe only technical problem we observed at the micro level was that the teacher experienced being \ntimed out (she had logged onto the website prior to the lesson). The issue of the lack of a guide to \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 13 \nusing Myartspace came up during teacher interviews and student focus groups. This issue was also \nraised in previous evaluation activities, in this and other trials. The Education Officers in two of the \nparticipating museums have written their own support material, which they distribute to teachers. \n4.3.2 The pre-visit lesson \u2013 meso level \nPre-visit lessons were not standard practice for this teacher, due to lack of time. The teacher\u2019s \nexpectation of this pre-visit lesson and the introduction of Myartspace was that it would help \nstudents to be more focused at the museum visit. Following the lesson, the teacher was very positive \nabout the students\u2019 level of interest.  \n In summary, the learning focus of the pre-visit lesson was on: \na. the History topic, i.e. D-Day;  \nb. the process of analysing and selecting sources\/objects, i.e. collecting; and  \nc. Myartspace, i.e. new technology.  \n4.4 The museum visit \nAt the museum, the teacher began by reiterating the learning task and the significance of the \nstudents' inquiry questions. The phones were distributed and the museum\u2019s Education Officer gave \na brief description of their main functions (see section 2). No mention was made of how many \nobjects to collect. Specific points made included: \n\u2022 when collecting an object, giving a reason will help later when creating their gallery, \n\u2022 a list is available of people who collected the same object - they could discuss their reasons \nfor collecting it, \n\u2022 for the audio recording they could read out an exhibit's label. \nThe students then set off in their groups to explore the museum. \n4.4.1 The museum visit \u2013 micro level \nAfter the pre-visit lesson, the student questionnaire asked how confident they were about using \nMyartspace in the museum. Results were 17% \u2018very confident\u2019, 50% \u2018fairly confident\u2019 and 33% \n\u2018not sure\u2019, with none indicating \u2018Not very confident\u2019 or \u2018Not at all confident\u2019. When asked in \nadvance what they expected to be able to do at the museum, the focus group\u2019s responses included:  \n\u2022 Take pictures \n\u2022 Record what pictures are of \n\u2022 Make [sound] recordings \n\u2022 Copy information that is available at the museum \n\u2022 Gather information to make their own website \n\u2022 Be able to make changes to collected items, with no limits on how much they can collect. \nThese expectations were generally realistic, apart from \u201cRecord what pictures are of\u201d; although \nMyartspace allows the user to take a photo and then record an audio or text comment about the \nphoto, the two items are not linked together by the software. This caused a problem in the post-visit \nlesson, and will be discussed later. \nDuring the visit there were minor usability problems with the phones, but these did not distract from \nthe activity. The main problems were a loss of signal in parts of the museum, the camera flash \ncausing problems with reflection in glass (which students could overcome by covering the flash \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 14 \nwith a finger), and the 15 second limit on audio recordings that was sometimes insufficient for \nreading text from an object\u2019s label into the phone.  \nIn general, the students in the focus group reported that Myartspace was easier to use than they \nexpected. One student mentioned that she liked the fact that the phone looked like a phone, and not \nlike a usual museum handheld audio guide. One student commented that recording audio was \nquicker than typing. They found that Myartspace made the visit less boring, \u201cmore modern\u201d than \ntraditional visits to a museum. Taking pictures and recording audio were highlighted as the \nfunctions they enjoyed most. \nIn a questionnaire administered immediately after the visit, 48% of the students found Myartspace \n\u2018very easy to use\u2019, 30% \u2018somewhat easy\u2019, and 22% \u2018average\u2019, with none indicating it was \u2018difficult\u2019 \nor \u2018very difficult\u2019. Taking photos was judged the \u2018easiest\u2019 thing they could do, recording sound was \n\u2018best\u2019 and \u2018writing comments\u2019 was hardest. In total, 637 objects were collected or captured by the \n23 students during this class\u2019s visit: 364 photographs, 121 sound recordings, 77 written comments, \nand 75 collected objects. \n4.4.2 The museum visit \u2013 meso level \nBoth teacher and students were fairly confident and enthusiastic about using Myartspace prior to the \nmuseum visit. At an interview just before the visit, the teacher anticipated that Myartspace would \nlead to \u201cmore interaction of pupils with exhibits \u2013 more questioning of them, not just taking what \nthey see at face value\u201d. She expected that the opportunity to practice collecting in a real context \nwould mean the students learned more about the process of collecting and thought students would \nbe quite discerning and critical about what they collected. \nAlthough the students exhibited generally high confidence levels regarding the use of Myartspace \nbefore the visit, they were reserved in their expectations of the Myartspace experience: 17% were \n\u2018Excited about using it\u2019, 66% \u2018Not sure\u2019 and 17% thought that \u2018It sounds rather boring\u2019.  \nThe girls\u2019 focus group provides a good example of collecting behaviour. The group began \ncollecting using the codes. One girl asked \u201chow do you collect\u201d and the other members of the group \nwere able to help. As they progressed around the museum the dominant behaviour was to copy the \ntext on the museum exhibit labels into the phone either as text or, more commonly, as an audio clip. \nSometimes a student would take a photo of an exhibit and then read the associated text into the \nphone (sometimes in addition to collecting using the object code). Although reading text from a \nlabel was a frequent activity for this class, it was probably prompted by the Education Officer in her \ninitial briefing; in other museum visits we have observed more students created their own audio \ndescriptions \nObservation in the museum of girls from the focus group showed them discussing among \nthemselves what they should collect. For example, one girl asked \u201cWhy do we want to collect this?\u201d \nwith another replying \u201cIt shows women working\u201d. The group negotiated what to write or, when \nrecording, what to say. At times they cooperated in deciding who would collect which item; at other \ntimes they all seemed to compete to collect the same object. There was confusion as to how they \nwould share the objects when they returned to school. One member of the group indicated they \nshould all collect everything so they would all have it available in their personal stores, while \nanother thought that they would all have access to each other\u2019s objects back at school. This issue \nalso appeared in the answers to the questionnaire after the museum visit (e.g. \u201c[The Myartspace \nstore is] good, but confusing because working in groups people can't make just one\u201d). \nCompetitive collecting was repeatedly observed in one group. In the focus group following the \nmuseum visit the students referred to \u201ccooperating\u201d to have only one person take a photo (and all \nuse it later), but \u201ccompeting\u201d to decide who should actually take the photo: \u201cargue over who would \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 15 \ntake the photo, cooperating but competing to take the photo\u201d. In the focus group one of the students \nsaid he wanted to go around by himself, because of arguments with his friends over who was \ncollecting what.  \nTaking photos was a popular activity. In the girl\u2019s group for example, one girl started to take a \nphotograph and another group member pointed out the 2-digit code for the object; the first girl took \nthe photograph nevertheless, commenting \u201cI want to take my own picture\u201d.  \nA snapshot of activity in one museum room towards the end of the visit found half of those in the \nroom were looking at their phones and half were looking around the room. That does not indicate \nthat children were engrossed in their devices rather than the museum, but rather that the technology \nmediates and extends the museum visit. The activity of collecting multimedia presentations \nencourages students to linger at designated exhibits and the recording of notes and pictures enables \nthem to create and preserve a personal perspective. Teachers in all Myartspace trials noted that \nstudents spent more time than on previous school visits and engaged more with the exhibits. \nAccording to one museum Education Officer, Myartspace extends considerably the average time \nstudents spend in the museum: \u201cA normal visit lasts approximately 20 minutes; a Myartspace visit \nis an hour and a half, so that students have more time working in the venue, looking at the \nmaterial.\u201d  \nIn the focus groups following their tour in the museum the students agreed that the process of \nreading out the label beside an exhibit as an audio recording was a good way of learning, and gave \nthem a purpose for their activity. They said they related their collections directly to the specific \ntopic they had been asked to concentrate on, although one student mentioned that she collected \nsome items only because they \u2018looked good\u2019.  The students expected to sift through their collections \nand select items suitable for their galleries during the post-visit lesson.  \nIn the questionnaire after the visit students were asked if they would visit a Myartspace museum \nagain. Responses were 57% \u201cYes\u201d, 30% \u201cMaybe\u201d and 13% \u201cNo\u201d. Responses for whether they \nwould recommend Myartspace to other students were 56% \u201cYes\u201d, 35% \u201cMaybe\u201d and 9% \u201cNo\u201d. \nInterviewed after the visit, the teacher was asked how effective the museum visit was. Her comment \nwas: \u201cstudents really enjoyed it and had lots of related questions after the visit\u201d. When asked how it \ndiffered from usual museum visits she commented: \u201cnormally a museum visit is a little passive with \nlimited interaction\u201d. Asked if there were any surprises, she said she was surprised at: \u201cjust how \nenthusiastic the students were\u201d. \n4.5 The post-visit lesson \nThe teacher guided them to log on to the website and demonstrated the main features, recapping the \nuse of stores and instructing them to create their own galleries to present the answer to one of their \ngroup\u2019s questions. She did not mention that placing an object in a personal gallery makes that object \navailable for all in the class store. \nAlthough they worked in groups in the museum, in this lesson they worked individually to create \ntheir own galleries. Each student selected one question from their group\u2019s list as the focus for their \ngallery. Students were allowed to choose the same question as other members in their group. \nThe teacher and assistant walked around the class answering mostly \u2018how-to\u2019 questions and helping \nthe students mainly with navigation problems such as \u201chow do I see the museum store?\u201d In some \ncases the students were prompted by the teacher to look in the museum store for items relating to \nthe topic they were working on. \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 16 \n4.5.1 Post-visit lesson \u2013 micro level \nWhile the students had been shown the website during the pre-visit lesson, they had no hands-on \nexperience or detailed knowledge of how to create galleries. In the questionnaire after the museum \nvisit students were asked \u201cHow confident do you feel about using the Myartspace website \ntomorrow?\u201d Responses were 30% \u2018very confident\u2019, 61% \u2018fairly confident\u2019 and 9% \u2018unsure\u2019, with \nnone indicating \u2018Not very confident\u2019 or \u2018Not at all confident\u2019. \nIn general, the students appeared to use the website successfully throughout the lesson. There were \nmany queries about spelling and the availability of a spell-checker. Myartspace deliberately did not \ninclude such a feature, to encourage students to work on their spelling. The main micro level \nproblems observed were: \n\u2022 Listening to audio recordings was problematic, as audio could not be turned up enough on \nthe PCs. Earlier trials suggest school PCs may often have problems with audio. \n\u2022 Several of the photographs that students had taken in the museum were not easy to identify. \nThis relates to the students\u2019 expectation (see section 4.4.1) to \u201cRecord what pictures are of\u201d. \nAudio and text comments made at the time a photograph is taken are not linked to the \nphotograph, and do not therefore serve as annotations. \n\u2022 The absence of a student from the post-visit lesson meant that their group could not access \nthe items that student had collected in the museum. \n\u2022 The gallery editing tool differed from other presentation tools such as PowerPoint\u00ae. In \nparticular, deleting items is done by \u2018hiding\u2019 individual items, while changing their order \ninvolves moving individual items one place at a time (requiring page reloads), which \nstudents found counter-intuitive and time-consuming. \nDuring the teacher\u2019s interview following the lesson, when asked how confident she had felt about \nusing the website in the lesson she replied \u201cOk although a little concerned. Instructions on use \nwould have helped\u201d. \n4.5.2 Post-visit lesson \u2013 meso level \nA questionnaire after the museum visit asked students whether they thought the post-visit lesson \nwould be different to lessons after other school trips. Eighteen students answered \u201cYes\u201d and two \nstudents answered \u201cNo\u201d. The use of technology was the most commonly cited reason for this \nexpected difference (\u201cusing computers\u201d, \u201cusing Myartspace\u201d, \u201cpictures and phones\u201d). Students also \ncited class discussion (\u201cwe\u2019ll talk about it\u201d), appreciation of the practical experience offered by \nMyartspace (\u201cexciting because it\u2019s not just theory\u201d) and the specified learning task (\u201cknow what to \ndo\u201d), and consolidation of their work (\u201cdraw all pictures and information together\u201d). \nWhen asked how critical the teacher thought students had been while collecting in the museum, the \nreply was: \u201cNot very \u2013 they thought they were at the time but have changed their minds since\u201d. \nThere was clearly not enough time to work with all the pictures collected (some students collected \nover 40 items), which prompted the teacher to schedule a second lesson for students to complete \ntheir galleries (although this lesson was not observed). The teacher estimated that a student can \neffectively process 5 to 10 items during one lesson. \nWhen asked how effective the post-visit lesson was the teacher responded: \u201cIt was good and \nconstructive, valuable learning took place as they reviewed their work\u201d. Focus group students said \nthey learned more about D-Day from the post-visit lesson as it gave them the opportunity to reflect \non what they had collected (\u201cthinking over it all again\u201d) \u2013 they do not want to \u201cread it all and forget \nit\u201d and remember it more because \u201cit\u2019s more modern\u201d rather than just \u201creading it all and then \nwriting an essay\u201d.  \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 17 \n4.6 Myartspace \u2013 at the macro level \nThe macro level examined the impact of Myartspace in terms of the effect it has on the educational \npractice for school museum trips: the impact on museums, and on teaching and learning. Key \nstakeholders (six teachers, three museum education officers, two members of the design team, and \none representative from the funding agency) were surveyed or interviewed with respect to their \nexperiences with the project and how they matched their initial expectations. Some of the \ninterviews took place as part of the final full-scale trial and others as part of a survey of teachers \nwho had used Myartspace outside evaluations. This section summarises the main results. \n4.6.1 Impact on museums \nMyartspace requires museums to digitise their contents and offer visitors additional material to \nwork with. Visitors then have the opportunity to access this content after they leave the museum. \nOne museum representative noted that \u201cPotentially [Myartspace] has made our collections much \nmore accessible.\u201d As the teacher in this trial suggested, and participants in previous trials have \nnoted, Myartspace also encourages visitors to go back to the museum.  \nMuseum representatives see Myartspace as a means of attracting secondary level students: \u201cThe \nmuseum had a lack of resources to support secondary school age children. Myartspace was a way of \nattracting secondary schools into the museum.\u201d  \nThe main drawback mentioned by museum representatives for adopting Myartspace was costs, in \nparticular the purchase of phones. The pilot phase of Myartspace began in February 2006; less than \na year later some participating students found the phones \u201cok but not cutting edge\u201d. Thus, to retain \nthe \u2018coolness\u2019 effect on the students, museums may need to upgrade the phones regularly. Museum \nstaff members are concerned about the time and resources required to support such a service: \n\u201cOur reasons for seriously considering whether to continue are the basics of finance and staff \ntime. It is difficult to see how we could make it sustainable due to the running costs.\u201d \n\u201cWe would have liked to continue with the service but it is not financially viable for us within \nour current budgets. We would only consider continuing with Myartspace if it could be funded \nagain.\u201d \nThe costs of digitisation were not mentioned as a drawback by museum representatives. This is not \nsurprising, as digitisation was part of the venues\u2019 contractual agreement and was compensated by \nthe project budget for all the venues that participated in the study. But, like phone purchase costs, \nwe expect digitisation costs to be an issue where external funding is not available. \n4.6.2 Impact on teaching and learning \nOne museum representative summarised the benefits of Myartspace for schools: \u201cIt is more work \nfor the teachers involved but those who have experienced Myartspace say that it is worth the effort. \nIt enables the school to focus on the museum, with the subject area and the technology.\u201d  \nMyartspace offers a better bridge between the museum and the classroom than traditional \nworksheets by allowing students to select artefacts from the museum and have them readily \navailable back in the classroom, along with the museum\u2019s whole digital collection. One teacher \ncommented on how Myartspace meant that the children\u2019s work would not be lost on the bus on the \nway back to school. \nMyartspace students have been observed to work with exhibits, asking questions \u201cwhy do we want \nto collect this\u201d, deconstructing objects, and reflecting on their relevance to the learning task. These \nbenefits are also indicated in the following quotes: \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 18 \n\u201cUsing Myartspace, children have to engage with the exhibit and communicate with each other. \nIt is important because children learn through engaging\u201d (Interview, Museum representative) \n\u201cMade me look at artwork more.\u201d (Interview, Student) \n\u201cIt was really enjoyable \u2013 students were extremely focused on task and got much more out of the \nvisit than I had anticipated.\u201d (Interview, Teacher)  \nIt might have been possible to design a student-visitor experience with the educational benefits of \nMyartspace without the use of digital technology, for example by replacing object collection \nthrough the phones with collecting small leaflets about each exhibit, or replacing the gallery \ncreation with the creation of paper-based collages. Such a non-technological approach would have \nadvantages and disadvantages over the current implementation of Myartspace. However, a major \nadvantage of the use of technology is the high motivation of the students, an effect appreciated by \nteachers, students and museum representatives, and summarised by a student as: \n\u201cMost people think going to galleries is boring, but when you put ideas on a web site and use the \nphones it's much more fun.\u201d (Interview, Student) \n5.  Discussion \nThe evaluation described in the previous section has raised a number of issues about the \ndeployment of Myartspace, many of which will be relevant to the deployment of other technologies \nthat support school museum visits. These issues are now discussed. \nWe should first consider possible effects of the evaluation activities on the collected data. Teachers \nparticipating in the trials were approached in advance of the visit and interviewed with respect to \ntheir expectations about, perceptions of, and plans for the use of the service \u2013 an act that may have \nprompted them to reflect further and may subsequently have positively affected the quality of the \nteaching. Nevertheless, the trials enabled us to document the potential of Myartspace, to observe \nproblems that occur even with well motivated teachers, and offer some advice for improvements. \n5.1 Adoption \nA significant problem facing Myartspace for wider adoption was the additional load placed on the \nschool and the teacher. Firstly, teachers commented that the cost of attending a training session plus \nthe costs for a replacement teacher for the day can be too expensive for a school, while running \nsessions after school hours requires teachers to give up their personal time.  \nMore significantly, most teachers who used the Myartspace service outside evaluation trials did not \nrun a pre-visit lesson, and some did not run a post-visit lesson. The most commonly cited reason for \nthis was costs, both time (integrating Myartspace with their classroom teaching) and financial \n(attending museum training sessions on the use of the website), as well as teacher\u2019s ICT skill level \nand thus their ability to support their classes using Myartspace back at school. Improving the \nTeacher\u2019s Pack may help here.  \nNonetheless, increased levels of engagement and motivation of the students in the museum were \nstill noted, but the opportunity to link the museum and school work directly was lost. It should be \nnoted that teachers who performed more than one visit suggested that subsequent visits take a lot \nless time to organise and plan. \nThe problem appears to lie primarily in the usability of the website. The results at the micro level \nindicate that the website is not intuitive to use (see section 4.5.1), especially for teachers with lower \nICT skills, necessitating teacher training which is only available on-site. This presents an example \nof how usability of the service at the micro level affects its adoption and institutional use at the \nmacro level. \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 19 \nA pre-visit lesson is important because the Myartspace experience requires a combination of skills, \ne.g. art, history, cross-curricular ICT, speaking and listening skills, group work and presentation \nskills. Preparing students is thus complicated, as it requires introducing them not only to the subject \nmatter (e.g. D-Day), but also to the concept and processes of collecting and the Myartspace \ntechnology. These all need to be addressed in the pre-visit lesson to enable students to get the most \nout of their experience. We expect that the introduction to the learning topic will not normally have \nto be part of the pre-visit lesson, if the Myartspace visit is booked according to the school subject \nprogramme. However, even the remaining two teaching goals (to introduce the process of analysing \nsources and objects, and to introduce the Myartspace technology) are challenging for a single \nlesson. Ideally, teachers would be encouraged to plan more than one pre-visit lesson to cover these \ntopics fully; given that in practice most teachers do not run any pre-visit lesson, it becomes critical \nthat at least the technology is easy to \u2018pick up and use\u2019. \n5.2 The phones \nA main attraction of Myartspace in the museum was the use of mobile phones. Mobile phones are \npopular among this age group, and the students can easily relate to their use. This may put mobile \nphone-based systems like Myartspace at an advantage in relation to other types of handheld \nmuseum guide for this age group. However, in assessing the motivational aspects of the technology, \nit should be borne in mind that this technology \u2018ages\u2019 perhaps even faster than other modern digital \ntechnologies. Most mobile phone service providers in the UK offer their contract customers the \noption to upgrade their phones every 18 months. This means that the \u2018lifespan\u2019 of a phone (in terms \nof desirability) is somewhat less than this 18 month contract period, possibly even less than a year. \nThe implications of such short-lived appeal can be substantial in terms of upgrade costs, and may \naffect the relationship between user satisfaction at the micro level and student motivation at the \nmeso level. \n5.3 Student collecting \nThe 562 objects created by the students, against the 75 collected using codes, suggest that students \nappreciate the sense of creativity and ownership that comes with creating their own representations \nof exhibits. However, it created another micro-level problem, this time affecting the learning \nexperience at the meso level. Myartspace does not support the interlinking of objects other than \npresenting them in chronological order of collection, causing students to complain that they could \nnot remember what certain photos they had taken were about, or relate photos to sound recordings \nor text comments. Given the students\u2019 appreciation of creativity and ownership, technical solutions \nat the micro level (e.g. enable interlinking of collected items) are more appropriate than \nconstraining student activity at the meso level (e.g. by confining the use of photo taking). \nIn addition, students in all trials thought that they did not have enough time in the post-visit lesson \nto process all the items they had collected in the museum. The teachers, too, acknowledged this by \nscheduling further lessons. The teacher in the final trial suggested 5 to 10 items as a realistic \nmaximum for students to process in one lesson. Most students had more than this in their personal \nstore, with some having over 40 items.  \nIt is possible that students were uncritical in collecting at the museum. However, this does not seem \nto have been the case: the teachers thought students interacted with the exhibits more, the students \nthemselves were observed to discuss \u201cwhy should we collect this item\u201d, and museum \nrepresentatives noted that students spend a lot more time on their museum tour with Myartspace \nthan without it. Another possibility is that the time required to critically examine and assess an item \nin the museum is less than that required to meaningfully process the item on the web site (i.e. \ndifference in time required for interactions at the meso level in the museum and the classroom); and \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 20 \nalso that the time required to interact with the mobile phone application to collect an item is less \nthan the time required to manipulate that item on the web site (i.e. differences in time required for \ninteractions at the micro level in the museum and the classroom). Thus, although students could be \nvery critical in collecting 40 items in one hour in the museum using the mobile phone, the same \namount of time was not adequate to meaningfully process them on the website in the classroom. \nThis discrepancy led to student frustration, had a negative effect on the learning experience, and \nmay have put some users off Myartspace. While a technical fix at the micro level (improving the \nweb site, or restricting the number of objects a student can collect) is possible, it should be noted \nthat learning to regulate the collection of data to simplify analysis is a valuable skill. It may be more \neffective to place greater emphasis in the pre-visit lesson on the need for students to be selective in \ncreating and collecting objects. \n5.4 Group work \nAnother example of problems at the micro level affecting learning at the meso level is in group \nwork. The focus groups showed that students within a group worked in either coordination or \ncompetition mode. In coordination mode, the group would agree who was going to collect an object \n\/ take a photo \/ record a sound, and what it would be. When in competition mode, each group \nmember would perform the function individually. In cooperation mode they had more opportunities \nto negotiate meanings and tasks and to challenge and complement each other\u2019s views. \nSwitching from collaborative work in the museum to individual work in the classroom generated a \nnumber of problems. The failure of Myartspace to provide tools for group work at the micro level in \nthe classroom (e.g. in the form of group stores and galleries or multi-user accounts) jeopardises \ncollaborative learning at the meso level. \n5.5 The experience \nOne of the focus groups considered the process of writing or dictating an exhibit label into the \nphone a good way of learning (see section 4.4.2), suggesting that students did grasp the educational \npurpose of collecting items and rationalised the capturing of the text in the exhibit labels.  \nHowever, capturing the content of the exhibit label differed from the service\u2019s objective for students \nto capture their own interpretations and reactions to exhibits alongside those offered by the museum \nthrough digitised content and print labels. This was not explicitly explained to the students. Instead, \na combination of the teacher\u2019s emphasis on picture and sound capturing and the museum Education \nOfficer\u2019s suggestion that the two may replace collecting through the codes, reinforced the capturing \nof the museum\u2019s interpretation. \nIt is not clear which of these two ways of use would maximise the learning outcomes for students. \nTo an extent, this can be considered evidence of Myartspace\u2019s flexibility and adaptability. \nNevertheless, informing the students about how the use of individual functions is expected to \nbenefit their learning may broaden their options and give them choice and control.  \n6.  Conclusions \nThe three-level evaluation framework that was presented in section 3.1 provided us with an efficient \nway to structure both the data collection and analysis for the evaluation of Myartspace. Successes \nand failures of Myartspace at all levels, micro, meso and macro have been identified, along with \ninter-level influences. Some of these were issues relevant to school visits to museums generally, \nsuch as the increased demands on teacher time and effort, and the division of costs to schools and \nmuseums. Others were specific to the implementation of the service, such as the usability problems. \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 21 \nNevertheless, and despite the needed improvements, we were able to document the potential of such \na service. \nThe trials have shown that the Myartspace experience can successfully bridge the museum-\nclassroom gap by facilitating the teacher\u2019s design of pre- and post-visit lessons, enabling students to \ncreate artefacts in the museum and have them readily available for further work in the classroom, \nand extending the museum context into the classroom through personal and museum digital \ncollections. The students in the trials appreciated the use of modern technology and teachers \nremarked on how enjoyable the experience was for students, increasing their levels of motivation. \nObservations showed students working with exhibits and asking questions about their relevance, \ndeconstructing objects, and reflecting on their relevance to the learning task. \nOften learners adopt a piece of new educational technology in ways that the designers and educators \ndid not expect. New tools that enable learners to perform new activities may change the way they \nperceive and carry out old activities. Thus, it is only through continuous evaluation and fine-tuning \nof the new technology with the learning practice (including adjustment of peripheral and contextual \nsupport, like lesson planning, IT support, and activity planning), that an educational innovation like \nMyartspace will reach its full potential in transforming educational practice. \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe would like to thank all the students, teachers, and museum educators who took part in our trials, \nwith special thanks to Bryony Kelly from the D-Day museum for her enthusiasm about Myartspace \nand her continuous support during the user trials. \nThe evaluation of Myartspace was funded by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport through \nCulture Online. Myartspace was designed and developed by The SEA (www.the-sea.com); the \nservice was re-branded as OOKL in 2007 and is now commercially available (www.ookl.org.uk) \nand used in a number of sites, including the Kew Gardens in London.  \n \nPreprint Article to appear in Computers & Education \n Page 22 \nReferences \n \nAbowd, G.D., Atkeson, C.G., Hong, J., Long, S., Kooper, R. & Pinkerton, M.
