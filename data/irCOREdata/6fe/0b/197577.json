Ranajit Guha\u2019s \nclassic history of peasant insurgency in colonial India argues that the hool exposed the \nfragility of the changing relationships between landholders, peasants, and itinerant \ncultivators like the adivasi Santals and, as such, it spilled over into and became a \nsignificant element of the later mutiny-rebellion. The hool was a full-scale uprising in \nthe Chota Nagpur Santal areas of the Bengal Presidency, in the region that now \ntraverses the states of Bihar and West Bengal. The Santals felt acutely the incursions \nof logging agents into the forests, and the deforestation implied by the expansion of \nthe railways. And so during the insurrection, the Santals attacked railway engineers, \nas well as the usual targets of rebellion: zamindars (landlords), mahajans \n(moneylenders), policemen, officials, and planters.3\n                                                 \n1 This research is part of a broader project on Indian Ocean penal settlements, funded by an Economic \nand Social Research Council research fellowship (award no. R000271268, 2002-6). I thank the \nCouncil; the University of Leicester for granting me leave during this period; the staff of the India \nOffice Records (IOR), National Archives of India (NAI), and Tamil Nadu State Archives (TNSA); and \nthe anonymous reader of this submission for his\/her insightful suggestions.  \n Yet attacks on railway bungalows \nand works were not provoked only by Santal displacement, for the coming of the \nsteam train had provided relatively lucrative employment for some. It could be a \npartial escape from the triple burden of what Guha describes as the \u2018landlessness, low \nwages and bonded labour\u2019 produced by British policies that favoured zamindars and \nmahajans over poor workers. According to Guha, the hool was also Santal revenge \n2 K.S.

Readers need look no further than Guha\u2019s magnificent Elementary \nAspects of Peasant Insurgency in these respects, or for a critical reading of the \nrebellion in relation to Santal notions of time the work of Prathama Banerjee.\n  \n6 Rather, \nI want to look at the aftermath of the Santal rebellion, and focus on what happened to \nthe many Santals who came before the courts on charges of treason, rebellion, \nplunder, and robbery. Large numbers of Santals were killed in combat, and the British \nexecuted dozens more. They sentenced hundreds to imprisonment in jails like \nBhagalpur and Beerbhum (the latter in the town of Siuri) in the heart of Santal \ncountry, or to transportation to the East India Company\u2019s penal settlement at the \nBurmese port of Akyab (Arakan).7 The article will elucidate two related processes in \nthe history of Santal incarceration. First, is clear that Santals suffered appalling death-\nrates in jail. Even Inspector-General of Prisons F.J. Mouat, himself a physician, \ndescribed the \u2018fearful mortality\u2019 that afflicted them.8\nIn relation to this, it is also worth noting that, as Banerjee illustrates, the hool \nwas neither a singular nor an exclusively Santal event, for a large number of non-\nSantals also participated.\n Second, both imprisonment and \ntransportation afforded British officials a unique opportunity to examine closely \nSantal society, and this led to the consolidation of extant discourses of the \u2018wild \ntribes\u2019. Yet these discourses were complex and in many ways contradictory, for as we \nwill see colonial notions of \u2018tribal wildness\u2019 on occasion produced simultaneously the \nSantals as \u2018model\u2019 prisoners. \n9\n                                                 \n4 Guha, Elementary Aspects, 142-3. \n Neighbouring tribal communities in Chota Nagpur like the \n5 Guha, Elementary Aspects, 97-8.  \n6 Prathama Banerjee, \u2018Historic Acts?

I will follow them in this respect, but readers should note that the descriptor \n\u2018Santal\u2019 was often part of colonial shorthand for the many and often diverse adivasi \ncommunities who populated particular regions of Bengal. \nImprisonment, Mortality, and the Model Prisoner \nIn August 1855, with the imprisonment of dozens of Santals arrested during the hool, \nBhagulpur jail was so full that cholera broke out.12 During the epidemic, fifty-two \nprisoners died in a single week. By the beginning of 1856, the number of Santals in \nthe prison had doubled and it had become so overcrowded that a large number of \nprisoners were sleeping outside. With three hundred Santals camped in a large grove \non the site of the jail, Mouat warned at the start of February that death-rates were \nrising.13 The civil surgeon of the jail, A.J. Sheridan, reported at about the same time \nthat the daily ratio of sick Santal prisoners was almost seven per cent, as compared to \nalmost four per cent of other prisoners.14\nThere were immense pressures on Beerbhum jail too. In 1855 it had been \nconverted into a fortress, magazine, and granary to house and to supply troops \nengaged in anti-hool operations nearby. By the end of the year, the jail was \novercrowded, manufacture had more or less ground to a halt, and the prisoners were \nno longer engaged in their usual productive labour.\n  \n15\n                                                 \n10 Kaushik Ghosh, \u2018A Market for Aboriginality: Primitivism and Race Classification in the Indentured \nLabour Market of Colonial India\u2019, in Gautam Bhadra, Gyan Prakash and Susie Tharu (eds), Subaltern \nStudies X: Writings on South Asian History and Society (New Delhi, Oxford University Press: 1999), \n13.  \n As death-rates began to rise, the \nBengal government asked the civil surgeon of the prison to send in weekly sanitary \nreturns. Though these returns did not enumerate Santals separately, the accompanying \nnotes leave no doubt that they constituted the largest proportion of sick inmates. \nSheridan, who had previously worked in the Indian penal settlement in Arakan, \n11 Gautam Bhadra, \u2018Four Rebels of Eighteen-Fifty-Seven\u2019, in Ranajit Guha (ed.), Subaltern Studies IV: \nWritings on South Asian History and Society (New Delhi, Oxford University Press: 1985), 256-63. \n12 IOR P.145.17 Bengal Judicial Consultations (henceforth Ben JC) 6 Sept. 1855: W.

He underlined the urgency of their trial, release and\/or \ntransfer. Three of the women had six young children, one of whom had been born in \nprison. The children were ill and he feared that they would die if not released: \u2018it is \npainful to behold the condition of these poor children\u2019. The government had in fact \nalready released sixteen Santal women and children, though not before many had \nalready succumbed to dysentery and dropsy.16 Sheridan\u2019s report was the first of many \nrepresentations on behalf of aged, infirm, and sick Santal prisoners.17 By March 1856, \ntwenty-five Santals had died while still awaiting trial.18\nAfter the hool, Mouat sought advice on how to avoid high death-rates among \nthe Santals, but he was never optimistic about his ability to prevent them altogether. \nHe made enquiries amongst railway overseers used to employing Santals, as well as \nRivers Thompson, the magistrate of Beerbhum, about how to ensure their good \nhealth. Thompson interviewed the Santals then in prison, and reported back to Mouat \non their desired provisions and clothing. Mouat also consulted the medical official Dr \nCheek, who worked in Bankura prison. He made a series of suggestions that \nsubsequently Mouat recommended to government. First, prison officials should issue \nall Santal prisoners with a daily supply of vegetables and meat twice a week. Second, \nthey should not give Santals too plentiful rations, for they were not accustomed to \nunlimited supplies of food. Third, they should limit the use of fetters in order to avoid \nthe production of sores. Fourth, government should only imprison Santals in their \nhome region. Finally, local officers should employ them on the roads in preference to \nindoor labour. Cheek pointed to the example of the terrible mortality that succeeded \nthe imprisonment of Kol rebels after the insurrection of 1831-2, writing of \u2018the known \ndepression which causes all such savages to sink and die when incarcerated, \u201clike old \nbirds when caught and confined in cages\u201d\u2019.\n \n19\n                                                 \n16 IOR P.145.26 Ben JC 20 Dec. 1855: Weekly sanitary report of Civil Surgeon A.J.

Of course prison \nmortality rates in general were very variable. In 1837, the Committee on Convict \nLabour reported that they ranged from less than one to more than twenty per cent per \nannum.\n \n21 The main causes of death amongst prisoners were cholera, malaria, \ndysentery, and diarrhoea.22 However, there is no doubt that tribal communities \nsuffered out of all proportion to other prisoners. A good example was the aftermath of \nthe Ghumsur Wars, which the British fought against the Konds of central Orissa in an \nattempt to take over (or as the British put it to pacify) territory in 1835.23 Of the one \nhundred and eighty Konds put on trial, forty-three were executed, forty-seven \nsentenced to life imprisonment or transportation overseas, and forty-eight to shorter \nterms of incarceration, mostly with hard labour on road gangs in chains. The \ngovernment shipped at least three to the penal settlement in Moulmein.24 Judicial \nprocedure in the Kond areas was administered through the Madras Presidency, and \nthe British thus transferred most of the remainder to jails in South India: Bellary, \nTrichinopoly, Chingleput, and Ganjam.25 Ten died before their terms had even \nstarted.26 As David Arnold puts it, the real end for communities like the Konds came \nnot with military defeat and judicial sentence, but with a miserable death in prison.27 \nLater in 1860, Inspector-General of Prisons Mouat even suggested that because a \nsentence of imprisonment was a near death sentence for adivasis, \u2018Hill Tribes and \njungly races\u2019 generally should be sent to the new penal settlement at Port Blair in the \nAndaman Islands in lieu of incarceration in mainland jails.28\n                                                 \n20 Ghosh, \u2018A Market\u2019, 17.  \n \n21 IOR P.141.9 Ben JC 14 Mar. 1837: Second and Concluding Report of the Committee of Convict \nLabour, 28 Jan. 1837. \n22 David Arnold, Colonizing the Body: State Medicine and Epidemic Disease in Nineteenth-Century \nIndia (Berkeley, University of California Press: 1993), 103-4. \n23 For a fascinating account of the campaign, see Felix Padel, The Sacrifice of Human Being: British \nRule and the Konds of Orissa (New Delhi, Oxford University Press: 1995), ch. 2.  \n24 TNSA Madras Judicial Proceedings (MJP) Vol. 304B: H.G.A.

Mouat reported that \nhe believed that no severity of punishment or discipline could be too stringent for the \nserious crimes of which they had been convicted, mostly rebellion or dacoity (gang \nrobbery). He wrote of the need to punish Santals so that they would \u2018profit by the \nexperience of the past, without encouraging other savages to repeat the same \nexperiment\u2019. Yet in practice their imprisonment was almost invariably a death \nsentence. In a bid to ameliorate Santal sickness, at the end of 1855 Mouat ordered \neither their transfer to Hazaribag jail, which due to its cool climate later the British \nchose as a particularly salubrious site for the incarceration of Europeans, or their \nemployment outdoors on the roads. Those Santals who worked well would, in \naddition, get a daily dram of liquor. However, he was not hopeful about the capacity \nof these recommendations to have any effect, writing that if the Santals were to be \npunished at all, inevitably they would suffer high death-rates.29 One solution proposed \nby Mouat, but rejected by government, was the forced resettlement of \u2018the misguided \nand starving\u2019 Santals in the Indian penal settlement at Arakan.30 At the time there \nwere just forty-three transportation convicts there,31 for in 1854 the government \ntransferred almost all its life convicts to Singapore, and subsequently transported only \nterm convicts to the settlement. Labour was therefore in great demand.32 Mauritian \nplanters too, desirous of indenturing \u2018hill tribes\u2019 to work in the island\u2019s expanding \nsugar industry, also suggested that migration was a preferable option for the \nemiserated Santals.33\nThe Bengal government made some limited concessions to Santal prisoners. \nAt the end of 1855, for instance, it released the four remaining women in Beerbhum \njail, though this was rather to protect their children from almost certain death than to \n \n                                                 \n29 IOR P.145.30 Ben JC 17 Jan. 1856: Mouat\u2019s memo on Beerbhum Jail, 18 Dec. 1855. \n30 IOR P.145.47 Ben JC 18 Sept. 1856: Mouat to Grey, 19 Apr. 1856. \n31 Fred.

Though \ntobacco had been banned in most Bengal Presidency jails in 1853, prisoners were \nusually able to get a supply through their guards or while working at outdoor labour. \nThis explains why its sudden withdrawal from jails had had no ill effects generally. \nYet the Santals\u2019 sense of deprivation points to their relative social isolation as a prison \ncommunity.35 They told Sheridan that outside prison they always suffered from sore \nmouths and throats when they were unable to acquire chewing tobacco.36 Once Mouat \nlearnt of the concession, however, he withdrew it. He maintained that the outbreak of \nmumps had not been caused by the lack of tobacco, and once again pointed to the \nneed to balance the issues of punishment and privilege with the prevention of crime \nand the protection of society.37 At the same time, according to the magistrate in \ncharge of the jail, W.J. Wigram, it seems that the issue of tobacco to the Santals had \ncaused considerable resentment on the part of other prisoners.38\nThe tension between the punishment and medical treatment of prisoners \ninevitably led to disputes between jail officials and doctors. As noted above, the civil \nsurgeon of Beerbhum jail was quick to call for the release of sick Santal prisoners. \nNeither was he reticent about bringing poor jail conditions to the attention of his \nsuperiors, writing in one weekly sanitary report in January 1856: \u2018Many of the \nsanthals possess no warm clothing whatever and sleep almost naked on the bare \nearthen floor \u2026 at this inclement season\u2019.\n \n39 Officiating Magistrate Thompson did not \ntake kindly to this criticism, noting in his submission of the report to government that \nthe prisoners had been issued with blankets, though there had been some delay.40\n                                                 \n34 IOR P.145.35 Ben JC 3 Jan. 1856: Grey to Thompson, 29 Dec. 1855. \n \nSheridan would not let the matter rest, complaining again and again about jail \nadministrators\u2019 failure to supply Santals with warm clothing, and the issue of too few \n35 IOR P.145.39 Ben JC 15 May 1856: Mouat to C.J.

Though he conceded to the issue of two blankets \nto each Santal, he believed that sickness was to a large degree inevitable, and at least \npartly caused by the overindulgence of a community unused to good food.42\n \n In \nresponse to Sheridan\u2019s criticisms, he wrote:  \nI cannot help having an idea that a good deal more illness among them has been \noccasioned by pampering and overfeeding than the reverse. Nothing can exceed Dr \nSheridan\u2019s attention to the prisoners, but he is continually trying to procure some \nluxury or indulgence for them; in my opinion injudiciously, and this over pampering \ncombined with the sense of confinement and comparative want of exercise is I believe \nthe cause of a good deal of the illness that has prevailed.43\n \n \nOther factors were the thin clothes Santals customarily wore and jail administrators\u2019 \nrefusal to allow them to light warming fires in prison. At the time of this letter, March \n1856, over ten per cent of the Santals were sick in the jail hospital.44\nWigram\u2019s opinions on the matter were strongly at variance with Santals\u2019 own \nperspectives on their punishment. Subaltern views on imprisonment are notoriously \ndifficult to ascertain. Yet with respect to the Santals, there are some clues. Mouat \nreported that during a visit to Beerbhum jail in December 1855, he had received more \nrequests for the removal of fetters and increases in rations than during his whole \npresidency wide tour of inspection the year before, when he had seen over four \nthousand prisoners. He wrote that the Santals \u2018generally entertain a very erroneous \nnotion of the objects of imprisonment, and evidently consider themselves the victims \nof society\u2019.\n \n45 No substantive mention is made of imprisonment and\/or transportation \nin surviving Santal accounts or songs of the hool, except that it took place.46\n                                                 \n41 For instance IOR P.145.35 Ben JC 20 Mar. 1856: Weekly sanitary report Beerbhum Jail, 16 Feb. \n1856. \n \nNevertheless, in reading against the grain of colonial correspondence a sense of the \nagency of Santal prisoners emerges.

Neither guards nor prisoners \ncould speak Santali, meaning that jail officials lost a vital source of information about \ntheir charge: the prisoner informer. In March 1856, for instance, two hundred and fifty \nSantals escaped from Dumka Jail, apparently having planned to do so within earshot \nof the entire prison establishment.47 Prison officials\u2019 failure to understand Santali \nperhaps also explains at least in part why they regarded Santal prisoners with a degree \nof ambivalence: on the one hand easily managed, on the other, according to \nadministrators like Magistrate Wigram, \u2018an uncertain set\u2019.48 One is left pondering the \nhuge possibilities for subversions of all kinds on their part, not least of which \nlinguistic. In relation to this point, it is worth noting the case of a Santal convict \nreturned from the Andamans penal settlement to the Indian mainland as \u2018insane\u2019 \nalmost three decades later. The surgeon of the transportation committee in Bengal \nexamined him and remarked that it was quite possible that because the man was \n\u2018uneducated and uncivilised\u2019, his \u2018clumsy, stupid and cunning\u2019 nature had been \nmisunderstood. The medical officer at Alipur jail near Calcutta, the largest in the \nBengal Presidency, added that because the convict could not speak Bengali very well, \nhe seemed stupid and \u2018slow of understanding.\u201949\nAs operations against the rebels continued in the districts during the military \ncampaign against the hool, more and more Santals arrived in jail. This added to the \nproblems of overcrowding and sickness, and of course raised the grim spectre of \nfurther rebellion and resistance. Colonial administrators were quick to express their \nauthority in this respect. In March 1856, for instance, they marched seventy-five of \nthe escaped Santal gang taken at Dumka back to Beerbhum, a two-day journey. They \ndid not give them shelter, rest, food or blankets on the way. On arrival, sixty-eight \nwere admitted to hospital. The remainder were crammed into Beerbhum prison, \nchained together in pairs, and expected to sleep on the bare earthen floor. Sheridan \nwrote of their \u2018extreme suffering\u2019 as they literally gasped for air. He urged a reduction \nin prison numbers or at the very least the removal of the Santals\u2019 fetters and the \nprovision of clean straw for them to sleep on. Otherwise, he urged, they might as well \n \n                                                 \n47 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Wigram to Grey, 28 Mar. 1856.

By this time, there were about a hundred prisoners \nmore than the jail was designed to hold (three hundred and seventy-five).50 Just three \nmonths earlier, Mouat had likened such overcrowding in Bengal\u2019s jails to the Black \nHole of Calcutta, that most evocative of colonial metaphors, warning district \nmagistrates to guard against it.51 There was little the magistrate of Beerbhum could do \nto deny the problem. Even according to him, the number of sick had doubled in just \none month, and a quarter of the Santal prisoners were in hospital.52\nThe Bengal authorities were clearly aware of the agency of their potentially \nrebellious charge and, after the Dumka escape, ordered that one hundred of the most \n\u2018dangerous\u2019 offenders or those with the longest sentences to serve be sent to Alipur, \nwhich had the most stringent discipline in the whole presidency.\n  \n53 But the problem \nwas not solved, for the transfer left Beerbhum free to receive more prisoners.54 \nNotwithstanding practical concerns, Wigram did not take kindly to Sheridan\u2019s \ncriticisms about the treatment of Santals jail, submitting his report to the Bengal \ngovernment with a note stating that it exceeded what was expected of a civil surgeon. \n\u2018[I]f I am not responsible for the safe keeping of the prisoners\u2019, he wrote, \u2018I must be \nable to secure them as I think best and I trust Government will decide whether I, and \nall the other officers connected with these prisoners are to be attacked in the strong \nlanguage and charged with gross inhumanity and unnecessary cruelty.\u201955 The \ngovernment did indeed make a decision, but in support of Sheridan. It called for the \nimplementation of Sheridan\u2019s suggestions and noted Wigram\u2019s \u2018want of proper care \nand attention\u2019. Wigram suffered the further humiliation of the correspondence being \ncopied to his civil surgeon and the inspector-general of jails.56 By this time, a third of \nthe original gang of seventy-five Santals marched from Dumka were still in the jail \nhospital. The jail officers transferred the remaining fifty to Alipur.57\n                                                 \n50 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Weekly sanitary reports Beerbhum Jail, 29 Mar., 6 Apr. 1856. \n With Mouat \n51 IOR P.145.30 Ben JC 17 Jan. 1856: Mouat\u2019s circular, 26 Dec. 1855. \n52 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Weekly sanitary report Beerbhum Jail, 6 Apr. 1856. \n53 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Grey to Wigram, 5 Apr. 1856.  \n54 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Wigram to Russell, 7 Apr. 1856. \n55 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Weekly sanitary report Beerbhum Jail, 6 Apr. 1856 - Wigram\u2019s \nremarks, n.d. \n56 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Buckland to Wigram, Mouat and Sheridan, 18 Apr. 1856. \n57 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Weekly sanitary report Beerbhum Jail, 20 Apr. 1856. \n 11 \nadding his support to the Bengal government, Wigram meanwhile assured them that \nhe would no longer interfere in matters of jail discipline.58\nAs this controversy shows, at least part of the reason that Santals suffered so \ngreatly was their sudden arrival in big groups after periods of socio-economic \ndeprivation, the authorities\u2019 concurrent failure to issue any or enough warm clothes, \nbedding, and blankets, or to allow the lighting of warming fires. This meant that they \nwere prone to illnesses like dysentery. In some respects, as visiting Sessions Judge \nO.W. Malet remarked, such treatment was unavoidable. Jails like Beerbhum were \nunprepared for the reception of large numbers of rebels, and space, blankets, and \nprovisions were all in short supply. Moreover, European officials were keen to avoid \nprisoner escapes, especially by those convicted as rebels, and so subjected prisoners to \nharsh discipline. Their Indian guards were no doubt complicit in this, for if prisoners \nescaped they faced the wrath of their superiors.\n \n59\nAnd yet despite the recognition by some prison doctors like Sheridan that \nSantal sickness was the result of the nature of rebellion and their treatment \nsubsequently, more usually officials represented it as caused by the intrinsic nature of \nthe Santal body itself. They viewed tribal communities used to living in the open air \nas suffering more from incarceration than other prisoners, and argued that they fell ill \nwith what commonly they described as \u2018mental depression\u2019.\n \n60 Indeed, during the \nsame period migrant dhangars suffered high death rates at sea, when conditions on \nboard overcrowded indenture ships bore a strong resemblance to those in colonial \nprisons.61\n                                                 \n58 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 8 May 1856: Wigram to Buckland, 23 Apr. 1856, Mouat to Buckland, 30 Apr. \n1856.  \n Officials used the language of contagion, described so eloquently by Guha \nin relation to peasant insurrection more generally, liberally. They represented Santals \nas both physically and morally infectious. Mouat wrote that like the Kols \u2018and all \nsimilar tribes of savages\u2019, there was \u2018pestilence and contagion into all places in which \nthey are confined\u2019. This could be explained by the type of food Santals customarily \nate, \u2018the flesh of what most nations regard as vermin\u2019 (snakes), and their liberal \nindulgence in alcohol. Moreover, like all tribal communities, they responded to \nimprisonment with a \u2018peculiar despondency\u2019, causing depression and thus disease. \n59 IOR P.145.46 Ben JC 4 Sept. 1856: Remarks by Sessions Judge O.W.

There was no question in his mind as \nto the relative development of India\u2019s adivasis, for he compared the Santals directly \nwith the \u2018monkey tribes\u2019 who, he claimed, always died once they were imprisoned.62 \nFor him, there was little difference in some of the physical symptoms displayed by \nboth \u2018wild animals\u2019 and \u2018wild tribes\u2019.63 Other prison administrators compared the \nSantals with supposedly uncivilized communities. The civil surgeon of Akyab, for \ninstance, wrote of their similarity with the \u2018half-tamed\u2019 Mughs under his charge.64\nAs unrest in the districts and the threat of prison-based resistance receded, \nthese discourses were further developed to transform \u2018tribal rebels\u2019 into \u2018poor \nSantals\u2019. To some degree, this was reflected in Sheridan\u2019s sympathetic eye with \nregard to high prison death-rates. Also, it became related to claims about the \u2018natural \nstate\u2019 of Santals, which denied them political consciousness. For instance, the Bengal \nauthorities maintained in May 1856 that most Santals were in prison because their \nleaders had taken advantage of their \u2018barbaric ignorance and superstition\u2019.\n \nThus within the medical discourses of colonial jails, notions of primitivism, wildness, \nand sickness became inextricably intertwined.  \n65 They \nfound Santal prisoners easy to manage, and this also fed into their descriptive \ntransformation. Colonial categories of rule were of course inherently contingent and \nunstable. An excellent example of this is produced through a close reading of the \ntransportation of large numbers of convicted thugs to the Burmese penal settlements \nduring the 1830s and 1840s. There they were transformed from the scourges of India \ninto what penal administrators described as the most orderly prisoners in their \ncharge.66\n                                                 \n62 IOR P.145.30 Ben JC 17 Jan. 1856: Mouat\u2019s memo on Beerbhum Jail, 18 Dec. 1855; P.145.31 Ben \nJC 24 Jan. 1856: Mouat to Grey, 29 Dec. 1855. \n The Santals too came to embody such complex slippages. By March 1856, \nthere were forty-four Santals in Alipur jail. Superintendent H. Fergusson was effusive \nin his praise for their exemplary behaviour. They had, he said, submitted to being \nwashed and having their hair shaved, and after being put to work had become expert \ngunny weavers and the best rope spinners in the prison. In fact, their work had been \n63 IOR P.145.37 Ben JC 12 June 1856: Mouat to Wigram, 5 Apr. 1856. \n64 IOR P.145.52 Ben JC 11 Dec 1856: J.W.

The Santals were not savages, but touchingly attached to their \nhomes and families.67\nAlmost certainly part of the reason Fergusson was so effusive in his praise \nwith respect to the management of Santhal prisoners was the avoidance of conflicts \nover issues relating to caste that were so central to the multiple meanings local \ncommunities attached to north Indian jails in the lead up to the mutiny-rebellion of \n1857-8.\n \n68 Santals could be put to any type of labour, and did not protest against \nparticular types of caste-based occupation. For instance, they were chosen to work as \nmehtars (sweepers), a lowly occupation that involved the disposal of human waste.69 \nSubsequently, the Bengal authorities decided that the Santals would not be \ntransported, but would remain in Alipur jail where they were easily managed and \nworked, and they enjoyed good health.70 Meanwhile, a call for information about their \nfamilies was forwarded to their home districts, for the Santals were keen to receive \nnews.71 An interesting aside in relation to the Santals\u2019 supposed attachment to their \nfamilies was the preference for tribal migrants among Mauritian sugar planters, on the \ngrounds that they had fewer concerns about migrating in family groups and thus were \nmore likely to form a population of permanent settlers.72 It has been estimated that \nabout seventeen per cent of the total migration to Mauritius (by far the largest \nrecipient of indentured labour in the British Empire) during the period 1842-70 were \ndhangars, the colonial term for adivasi migrants. The history of indentured \nimmigration also shows that the devastating mortality suffered by Santals in prison \nwas not unique. Death rates amongst tribal migrants were ten times that of others \nsigning contracts of indenture. In the Mauritian case, this eventually led to the \nfavouring of non-tribal groups in indentured recruitment, notably those from South \nIndia.73\n                                                 \n67 IOR P.145.44 Ben JC 5 June 1856: A.

What made \nthem attractive as prisoners was to a large degree what earlier had made them \nattractive as railway workers, and later as indentured labourers. As well as being well \nversed in seasonal migration, colonial officials considered adivasi migrants more \ngenerally as unrestrained by caste taboos, and thus willing to perform menial labour. \nKaushik Ghosh argues that such de-casting was another way of putting them outside \nthe pale of civilization.74 And yet as a group the Santals present a clear contrast with \nother socially marginal caste Hindu communities who used their experience in jail as \na means of launching periodic claims for social mobility.75 Within the prison system, \ncolonial officials came to regard Santals so well that district magistrates often \nrequested them specifically for road labour projects.76 Their expertise in prison \nmanufactures also came to be admired widely.77 Even magistrate Wigram in \nBeerbhum, who had once regarded the Santal prisoners under his charge as an \n\u2018uncertain set\u2019, wrote against their transfer to road labour because he found them so \nskilled at indoor manufactures.78 Their conduct was so exemplary that in February \n1857 Superintendent Fergusson arranged for the one hundred and sixty-eight Santals \nthen in Alipur jail to be given a conditional pardon on the condition that they go to the \nSunderbans to work on land clearing projects. In April, cholera broke out amongst the \ntransferred men and twenty-one of them died. With the exception of three men who \nwere too ill to move, the remainder asked to be readmitted to jail rather than face \ncertain death in the jungles. Fergusson saw this as evidence of their general \ntrustworthiness, and asked government to issue them a conditional pardon in \nexchange for their agreement to work anywhere where there were labour shortages.79\n                                                 \n74 Ghosh, \u2018A Market\u2019, 21-2.  \n \nThe commissioner of the Santal Parganas, however, advised against the measure.

Their liberation caused huge \nconcern to the colonial administration, for they became involved in what the \nofficiating commissioner of Chota Nagpur described as \u2018widespread plundering\u2019 in \nthe district.81 In one attack, six or seven hundred Santals marched on a village in \nRampur. As during the hool they were accompanied by a drum, a flag, and music.82\nAs the British reoccupied and secured jails like Hazaribag and Maunbhum in \nthe aftermath of the crisis of 1857-8, it faced a new set of problems relating to what to \ndo with hundreds of newly-convicted prisoners, many of whom were in poor health as \na result of the deprivations of revolt. It was not long before the jails became \novercrowded. Alipur jail, for instance, was almost fifty per cent over capacity. It was \ndesigned to hold a maximum of 1307 prisoners, but at this time its daily average rose \nto 1895.\n \nSubsequently, a handful of Santals were convicted of offences like rebellion, dacoity, \nand plunder connected with the revolt and imprisoned on the mainland or shipped as \ntransportation convicts to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands, though we know almost \nnothing of their experiences there.  \n83 Later, Inspector-General of Prisons Mouat described the \u2018formidable \nsickness\u2019 that had gripped the jail at the time. During 1858 there were serious \noutbreaks of cholera and gangrene, caused by the constant arrival of sick prisoners \nand insufficient or unsuitable rations for \u2018up-country\u2019 inmates from the plains. Four \nhundred and forty prisoners died during the year.

During the first year, \na phenomenal eighty per cent of a daily average of three hundred and eighty-four \nprisoners died.86 Although the government had ordered the retention in Alipur of \ninfirm or elderly inmates, in effect the jail authorities took the opportunity to dispose \nof every prisoner it could.87 Many of the men sent to Akyab were in a terrible state. \nOf the first batch of eighty convicts, for instance, just eight were fit for labour. Only \nsixteen men were younger than fifty years, and their average age was fifty-eight. On \narrival in Akyab the commissioner split the prisoners into two gangs, putting one to \nwork at the civil station and the other at clearing jungle in the Noakhally salt water \nmarshes. Most of the convicts, referred to be Civil Assistant Surgeon J.W. Mountjoy \ndescribed as \u2018Hindu\u2019 and \u2018Bengali\u2019, went on hunger-strike. It was not long before \ncholera, bowel disorders, and fever broke out in both gangs.88 One hundred convicts \ndied, including a man who committed suicide. Mountjoy claimed that this was the \ninevitable result of \u2018moral causes acting on the physical frame\u2019 after the British \nquashed the revolt. Therefore, convicts had resorted to \u2018voluntary starvation\u2019 and \nrefused to take medicine.89\nAt the end of 1859 the government of Bengal instructed Mouat to conduct an \nenquiry into the devastating death-rates experienced by convicts in Akyab. By the \ntime of he visited the settlement, most of the remaining Indian convicts had died.\n \n90\n                                                 \n85 Mouat\u2019s report, 1858-9, 34. As these were controlled by the Bengal Presidency, strictly speaking the \nprisoners were subject to prison transfer not transportation. This avoided any potential difficulties in \nchanging the terms of their original sentence. \n \nMouat disagreed with Mountjoy\u2019s assessment, and concluded that high mortality was \nthe result of the convicts\u2019 work in the salt marshes, for their camp had been ill-chosen \nand no sanitary measures had been put in place. Moreover, it had been unusually hot \n86 Mouat\u2019s report, 1858-9, 28. \n87 This was a common feature of local policy in relation to transportation.

The \nlatter of course took on a whole new dimension in the context of the mutiny-rebellion, \nin which the public perception of widespread colonial violations of caste in jails, \nparticularly the introduction of the system of common messing, was so central.93 This \nwas foremost in Mountjoy\u2019s mind, for he compared the \u2018pampered\u2019 prisoner with the \n\u2018petted\u2019 army. He wrote that even if convicts were given purple silks (to indicate their \nnobility) they would remain as dissatisfied as the recently mutinous sepoys. Caste \nobjections to the cultural conditions of imprisonment and transportation, notably with \nregard to rations, were evidence of the \u2018gross ignorance and prejudice\u2019 through which \nthey \u2018whined, cried, sulked with their food, became skeletons \u2026 and died\u2019.94 \nTypically, the voices of the convicts themselves are absent from the account and so it \nis not clear whether the hunger-strike had broader political motives or aims. \nNevertheless, there is some suggestive evidence that when the British transported \nmutineer-rebel convicts to the Andaman Islands after 1858, they suffered appalling \ndeath-rates, perhaps for similar reasons.95\nThe Santal convicts alone escaped this devastating mortality, with Mountjoy \ndescribing them as \u2018very robust and splendid fellows\u2019.\n \n96 It seems that they complied \nwith the Akyab convict regime with respect to rationing. Mountjoy reported that \nSantal convicts ate well, and so remained \u2018sleek, laughing and in good condition\u2019. He \nlamented the fact that other Indians did not possess \u2018the wisdom of the barbarian.\u201997\n                                                 \n91 IOR P.146.28 Ben JP June 1860: Thompson to Mouat, 29 Dec. 1859; Mouat\u2019s memo, 30 Apr. 1860. \n \nThe Santals both ate their jail rations and took advantage of their employment at \noutdoor labour to collect herbs, leaves, and other foodstuffs, a practice which \n92 Mouat\u2019s report, 1859-60, App. I, 118. \n93 Anderson, The Indian Uprising, ch. 2. \n94 Mouat\u2019s report, 1859-60, App. I, 119. \n95 Mouat\u2019s report, 1859-60: App. I, 114. \n96 Mouat\u2019s report, 1857-8, App. I, 111-13; Mountjoy\u2019s annual report of Akyab jail hospital, 1858. \n97 Mouat\u2019s report, 1858-9: Annual report Akyab jail hospital: Mountjoy to Shepherd, 11 Sept. 1857 \n(n.p.) \n 18 \nMountjoy urged other convicts to follow.98 It was not long before local officials \npromoted Santal majhis (chiefs) to burkundauzes, or overseers over ordinary \nconvicts.99\nMeanwhile, at the end of 1859 the Indian authorities extended a general \npardon to Santal prisoners still in jail for rebellion or plunder committed during the \nhool. Fergusson\u2019s successor at Alipur jail was no less effusive in his praise for the \nnineteen Santals then remaining there, writing that their conduct was excellent and \nthat he had never had cause to reprimand them.\n This was a considerable elevation of penal rank awarded to few convicts. \nFor Indians of rank in the settlement, the men Mountjoy called \u2018Hindus\u2019 and \n\u2018Hinduised Muslims\u2019, this must have been an extraordinary inversion of the social \norder, and one that could only add to the grievances they felt as transportation \nconvicts.  \n100 Another official described them as \nthe best prisoners in jail, writing, \u2018They are always willing to work and are never \nfound malingering, are patient, contented and never grumble, and it has never been \nfound necessary to punish any of them.\u2019101 The government directly referred to their \npardon and release as a sort of moral bargain, or clemency in exchange for guarantees \nof their future loyalty and good conduct.102 In 1861, and considering once again their \nmodel behaviour in prison, the Bengal government also pardoned Santals convicted of \nriots attended with murder during the hool. Only those concerned in murder or other \nviolent crimes were kept in jail.103 At the same time, the government also made \nmoves to extend the same provisions to those Santals in other prisons for the same \noffences.104\n \n  \nConclusion \nDespite the insights attempted in this article, evidence of post-hool experiences of \nSantals is at best fragmentary. Of particular interest is the question of what happened \nto those Santals who managed to evade the clutches of the colonial courts during \n                                                 \n98 Mouat\u2019s report, 1859-60, App. I, 119. \n99 Mouat\u2019s report, 1859-60, App. I, 115.  \n100 IOR P.146.30 Ben JP (jails) Aug. 1860: \u2018Statement of the nineteen sontal [Santal] prisoners who \nwere in confinement in the Alipore [Alipur] Jail on the 23rd November 1859\u2019. \n101 IOR P.146.44 Ben JP (jails) Oct. 1861: \u2018Statement of Santal prisoners confined in the jails of the \nLower Provinces except Alipur\u2019, 9 Aug. 1861. \n102 IOR P.146.21 Ben JP 20 Oct. 1859: Thompson to Commissioner Santal Parganas, 19 Oct. 1859. \n103 IOR P.146.44 Ben JP (jails) Oct. 1861: J.

Did they continue their tradition of seasonal migration, or perhaps sign \ncontracts of indenture to overseas sugar colonies like Mauritius as was suggested at \nthe time? Moreover, to what extent were the Santal rebels of 1855 involved in the \ntribal rebellion that gripped the district of Chota Nagpur two years\u2019 later?105 Reports \nat the time suggest that mutineer-rebels liberated Hazaribag and Maunbhum jails in \nthe middle of 1857 in order to release the hool Santals imprisoned there. To the \nBritish, the prospect of their crossing into the far from pacified neighbouring districts \nand combining with their fellow Santals was extremely worrying.106 It is clear that the \nBritish later imprisoned or transported Santals for mutiny-rebellion offences. In 1861 \nover one hundred were still in prison in mainland jails, most for the offences of \nplunder or riot rather than rebellion per se.107 The colonial perspective was that they \nhad taken advantage of widespread social anarchy for their own personal gain. They \nwere not, the commissioner of Chota Nagpur assured his colonial superiors, \u2018political\u2019 \nprisoners.108\nAfter the1855 revolt, Santal prisoners experienced appalling death-rates in \nprisons. There was a combination of reasons for this, including their already poor \nhealth in the aftermath of the hool and their admission to jail in large numbers, \nleading to overcrowding and shortages in clothing, bedding, and rations. And yet \ncolonial discourses commonly heaped the blame for elevated mortality on the Santal \nbody politic and its intrinsic savagery and\/or embodied wildness. This presented a \nstark contrast to the overseas penal settlement at Akyab, where officials used the same \ndiscourses in representing Santal rebels as the healthiest convicts of all. At the same \ntime, Santals seemed uninterested in using their experience of incarceration or \ntransportation for the purpose of social mobility and were apparently willing to take \non tasks usually performed by low or outcaste communities, and to learn a variety of \npenal trades. Discourses of wildness thus became intertwined with corresponding \n His comments of course speak to a narrow definition rather than a \nnuanced understanding of the social meaning of tribal insurgency. And, as we have \nseen the same linguistic turn was employed by officials writing of Santal prisoners in \nthe aftermath of the hool. \n                                                 \n105 On the Kols, see Bhadra, \u2018Four Rebels\u2019, 256-63.
