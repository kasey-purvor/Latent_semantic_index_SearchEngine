Its grisly\ntale could easily be by Aeschylus: think of the\nbloody dispatch of Agamemnon in his bath, or the\nhorrific slaughter of their 50 husbands by the\ndauntless daughters of Danaus. \nYet for sheer brutality, the Thyestes myth (gen-\nerally accepted as a prime source for\nShakespeare\u2019s Titus Andronicus) is hard to beat.\nClaus based his play on Seneca, who was only too\nhappy to let blood flow freely onstage. Happily in\nthe opera, for which Claus has reworked his play\nas a libretto, we were spared the spectacle of John\nDaszak\u2019s leering Atreus slitting the throats of his\nbrother\u2019s small sons \u2013 whom we had just a\nmoment earlier watched innocently disporting\nthemselves with a bright pink kite and blue and\nyellow balloons. As in Greek drama, that\u2019s left for\na Messenger to describe. \nBut we do witness the famous banquet, in which\nAtreus, the father of Agamemnon, in revenge for\nhis younger brother\u2019s cuckolding him and conceiv-\ning designs on the throne, serves up to Thyestes (the\nAmerican baritone Dale Duesing) the boiled\nhuman flesh of his sons right there on stage. For\nsheer ghastliness, child slaying is about as vile as it\ngets. But this \u2013 \u2018a penalty beyond the bounds of\nhuman hate\u2019 \u2013 beats even that. When the boys\u2019 sev-\nered heads are kicked around the stage in a rouged\nsack, this is not one for the squeamish.\nThe slightly too static staging by Gerardjan\nRijnders for Brussels\u2019s Opera Royal de la Monnaie,\npremi\u00e8red on 2 October, improved dramatically as\nthe four main acts (or scenes) progressed.\nMusically, the opera could not have had a better\nadvocate than conductor Stefan Asbury, whose\nintelligent quick grasp of complex modern scores\nhas rendered him a valuable and enabling figure in\nthe European contemporary music world. Van\nVlijmen opted to dispense with the full-sized\norchestra of La Monnaie, restricting himself to an\nexpressive ensemble with solo strings. Here,\nAsbury conducted the capable Asko Ensemble\nand Cappella Amsterdam. \nNervy brass, eerie percussion and slithering\nstrings soon gave a sense of the atmospheric,\nsinewy music van Vlijmen \u2013 originally a forthright\nserialist of the Birtwistle generation \u2013 elected to\nembrace later in his career. But it took a moment\nor two to adjust to Rien Bekkers\u2019s individual cho-\nrus costume designs, which left the initially inert,\nsupine choir looking slightly comic \u2013 like an adver-\ntisement for flowery pyjamas \u2013 amid a potentially\nforceful opening tableau featuring a vengeful,\nblood-red Fury (fearsomely intoned by contralto\nHelena Rasker) and the father of this doomed\nrace, Tantalus (Harry Peeters), emerging from the\nrear like a ghoulish Caliban. \nNeither Daszak nor Duesing seemed very help-\nfully directed: this endangered the impact of\nearlier scenes. But the cavern of dripping sound \u2013\nbells, bowed percussion and harp \u2013 that evolved\nduring one early brothers\u2019 encounter; the touch-\ning exchange between Thyestes and his young son\nTantalus (clear echoes of Debussy\u2019s Yniold); and,\nin particular, the impressive Messenger scene,\nominously hammered home by the magnificent\nSyrian bass Nabil Suliman, picked out in shadow\nand supported by bowed percussion and overtly\ngrieving brass, came across especially strongly. \nPaul Gallis\u2019s simple but effective d\u00e9cor deliber-\nately restricted the stage action to an oval area,\naptly recalling the curved \u2018orchestra\u2019 space of\nEpidaurus or Athens\u2019s Theatre of Dionysus. Solos\nwere well taken: a striking passage for double bass\nas Atreus cynically deceives Thyestes into accept-\ning a share of the crown; another for cor anglais,\nemerging as a desolate prelude to the final revela-\ntions. In yet another sequence Daszak\u2019s Atreus,\npitched high in the tenor register, is subtly under-\nscored by dark low strings and bassoon; as\nThyestes\u2019 misplaced optimism grows, several bars\nscored for viola and bassoon seem poignantly to\nquestion his doomed false hopes. \nBest was the final encounter \u2013 a long drawn out\nexchange between the two brothers during which\nClaus cleverly permits the full horror (of the boys\u2019\nslaughtering, the true nature of the supposed ban-\nquet, and the fact that Thyestes, just when\nsupposedly celebrating the two brothers\u2019 reconcil-\niation, is consuming his dead sons\u2019 flesh and\nquaffing their blood) \u2013 to emerge only casually, bit\nby bit. Slyly, sneeringly, scowlingly, Daszak\u2019s\nAtreus gradually tightened the screw. But it was\nDuesing\u2019s harrowing depiction of Thyestes as an\nincreasingly crumpled, scarred and ultimately sui-\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773\n63Tempo 60 (235) 63\u201382 \u00a9 2006 Cambridge University Press\nDOI: 10.1017\/S0040298206000064 Printed in the United Kingdom\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ncidal victim that finally gave this grim opera its\nbite. Van Vlijmen saw this last sequence as \u2013 para-\ndoxically \u2013 a virtual \u2018love scene\u2019 between the two\nbrothers. Rijnders\u2019s direction was unexpectedly\ngood here: the effect of this final scene was unde-\nniably searing.\nRoderic Dunnett \nCheltenham Festival 2005: John Pickard\u2019s\n\u2018Gaia\u2019 Symphony for brass\nThe world premi\u00e8re of John Pickard\u2019s Gaia\nSymphony for brass band is arguably the most\nexciting and distinctive piece of programming by\nMartyn Brabbins in the first Cheltenham Festival\nunder his Artistic Directorship. Both Brabbins and\nPickard grew up in the brass band tradition, which\nthe symphony both respects and transcends. The\nGaia Symphony has had a long gestation period. \nThe title of this colossal, hour-long work refers\nto the Greek goddess of the Earth, and reflects the\nsymbolic connexion of each movement to natural\nphenomena, based on the four elements of Water,\nFire, Air and Earth. The symphony consists of\nfour separate tone poems or movements linked\ntogether by \u2018Windows\u2019 written for six percussion-\nists. These pivotal interludes refine the score\u2019s\npalette and give the brass players a well-earned\nrest, as well as adding a fresh perspective on the\npreceding music and anticipating the ensuing\nmaterial. Each of the movements was in fact writ-\nten and performed separately (the earliest,\nWildfire, as long ago as 1991) and it was only after a\nspan of 13 years composing the four tone poems\nthat the composer decided to unite them into a\nsingle entity.\nFrom the introductory bars, it is evident that\nthis is going to be a large-scale, truly symphonic\nwork. Momentous pedal points and ominous osti-\nnati tell the audience they are about to embark on\na vast journey. There is a genuine sense of expecta-\ntion as the odyssey is begun. The opening\nmovement, Tsunami, was completed in 2002 and\nhence has no reference to the tragic events of\nBoxing Day 2004. It is, rather, a purely musical\nresponse to the concept of the momentum built\nup and ultimately discharged by a large tidal wave.\nThe movement is launched and driven by nervous\nenergy, grippingly held in check during a tense\ncentral section that features solos of eerie fore-\nboding. \nWildfire was inspired by a newspaper report of\ntwo forest fires that started separately before con-\nverging on each other. Again, this movement is\nnot a literal depiction of the fire, but there is a\nfierce, blazing quality to this, the scherzo of the\ndesign. Phrases flicker, spit and flare up, burning\nthrough climaxes of white heat, which extinguish\nthemselves in a remarkable, desiccated fragment\nof crackling wooden slapsticks. Aurora, a tenderly\nsketched depiction of the Aurora Borealis, offers\ncrucial respite after the fierce energy of the first\ntwo movements. Interlacing solos shape the fabric\nof this serene, contemplative slow movement,\nweaving a fragile, kaleidoscopic skein of gos-\nsamer beauty.\nThe Finale, Men of Stone, is cast in four distinct\nsections, each picturing an ancient site housing\nvarious Neolithic stone circles around the British\nIsles, captured at specific times of day. \u2018Avebury\u2019 is\ndepicted on an autumnal morning, \u2018Castlerigg\u2019 in\nCumbria in a snowstorm on a winter\u2019s afternoon,\n\u2018Barclodiad-y-Gawres\u2019, on the coast of Angelsey,\nduring a spring sunset and \u2018Stonehenge\u2019 during\nMidsummer\u2019s Eve, as dawn emerges through the\nstones. Whilst Earth remains the dominating ele-\nment behind the whole of Men of Stone, its four\nsections also contain the classical elements repre-\nsented by the four movements of the symphony as\na whole: earth for \u2018Avebury\u2019, air for the blizzard\nscene of \u2018Castlerigg\u2019, water for the seascape of\n\u2018Barclodiad y Gawres\u2019 and fire for the climactic\nmidsummer scene of \u2018Stonehenge\u2019. The four-in-\none nature of \u2018Men of Stone\u2019 serves as a rigorous\nreview of the entire large-scale structure, in true\nsymphonic fashion. The massively optimistic final\nmajor chord, with which this work ends, not only\nrepresents harmony between a natural and man-\nmade phenomenon, but also signifies journey\u2019s\nend for this spectacular aural voyage. \nSpecial mention must be made of the three\ntransitional \u2018Windows\u2019, which use a variety of\ndrums, bells and cymbals. They link the four main\nmovements and go a long way towards securing\nthe success of the whole symphony. As well as\noffering a welcome contrast in timbre from the\nbrass band sonorities, these interludes gather in\nrhythmic complexity, from the regular pulse of\nthe first via the elaborate counterpoint of the sec-\nond to the more flexible and irregular aspect of the\nthird. They contribute vital musical and narrative\ncohesion.\nThe Buy As You View Band (formerly the Cory\nBand), under the direction of Robert Childs, gave\na virtuoso world premi\u00e8re performance, with fine\nbrass sonorities allied to a keen rhythmic sense\nand peerless technical execution. It is good that\nthey have recorded the work, so their masterly\ninterpretation of this monolithic tour de force can\nbe widely heard (Doyen CD 188). \nPickard\u2019s Gaia Symphony is a remarkable\nachievement, challenging received opinion about\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f64\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthe brass band concert repertoire \u2013 habitually a\ndiet of trite marches, prosaic arrangements and\nmortifyingly stodgy versions of pop tunes. He has\nsucceeded in creating an epic work of genuine\nsymphonic weight as well as dimension, with sub-\ntle thematic and structural links between all four\nmovements. A lesser composer might have pro-\nduced the longest test piece in the history of the\nbrass band movement, but Pickard is a natural\nsymphonist, thinking in long-breathed, sweeping\nparagraphs of sound and, as in Nicholas Maw\u2019s\nOdyssey, the very choice of material determines\nand sustains an expansive structure. I hope John\nPickard will go on to write more symphonies\n(Gaia is his Fourth): on the strength of this exam-\nple and his bravely compelling Second and Third\ncontributions to the genre, he has the technique\nand the temperament to emerge as one of the\ngreat symphonists of the 21st century.\nPaul Conway\nProms 2005 (1): Berkeley, Musgrave,\nMacMillan, Glanert, Corigliano, Abrahamsen\nMichael Berkeley\u2019s 24-minute Concerto for\nOrchestra is the second work to emerge from his\nappointment as Associate Composer of the BBC\nNational Orchestra of Wales which, under its\nchief conductor, Richard Hickox, gave it the world\npremiere on 19 July (the first fruit of the union was\nTristessa (2003), a concerto for viola and cor\nanglais). It opens, Energico, with a tone of fierce\nexultation, the material acknowledging the genre\nas it is passed around the orchestra in urgent \ndiscussion, the string-writing animated by\nTippett-like rhythms, the textures somehow man-\naging to be both bright and dark at the same time \u2013\nnot least because Berkeley is remembering his\nbass lines. An oasis of calm in the centre of all this\nactivity is inhabited by pizzicato violins and tuned\npercussion, who play with a descending motif that\nruns through the whole work; here it drifts down-\nwards like a fleck of dust on the eye. The brass and\nheavier percussion, sustained by long string lines,\nreturn the temperature to the intensity of the\nopening, and the movement closes with a decisive-\nness reminiscent, oddly enough, of Roy Harris.\nThe title of the slow movement, \u2018Threnody for\na Sad Trumpet\u2019, might suggest a Morton Gould\nminiature; in fact, Berkeley was sitting down to\nthe music when he heard news of the death of\nJane Attenborough (daughter of Richard, who\nwas present for what must have been one of the\nmost poignant first performances of his long life)\nand his grief worked its way into the music. The\nmovement begins with gossamer string figures\ndappled with light from tuned percussion, bells,\npiano, before the trumpet intones its elegiac line,\nlyrical but immensely sad and essentially alone; a\nlight crash from the percussion silences it, and the\nstrings continue the tissue of mourning before the\ntrumpet elegy resumes over an ominous com-\nmentary from bass drum and timpani. The finale\nerupts Con fuoco with an antiphonal crash of cym-\nbals, unleashing melodic shapes that now bustle\nupwards \u2013 the long shadow of Tippett still audible\nin the strings. Angry gestures from brass and per-\ncussion, and a repeated brass chord unleashes a\nmonumental chordal underpinning from the\norgan; after a sudden silence, the last emphatic\nrhythms are punched out tutti. That unexpected\norgan irruption underlined my principal misgiv-\ning about the work as a whole. Even in a concerto\nfor orchestra, when showing off the myriad vari-\neties of texture available from the modern\nsymphony orchestra, you need to stay your hand:\nconstant variety is no variety at all. That last-\nminute organ blast shoots the work in the foot: a\nbig gesture to underline the fact that it was the first\none we had heard \u2013 and that Berkeley achieves his\nclimax through the simple expedient of unleash-\ning violent power rather than generating genuine\nintensity.\nAs with Berkeley\u2019s Concerto, Thea Musgrave\u2019s\nTurbulent Landscapes (2003), given its London pre-\nmi\u00e8re on 20 July by the BBC Scottish SO under its\nmuch-missed former chief conductor Osmo\nV\u00e4nsk\u00e4, showed some remarkably inventive\norchestral writing, but it likewise suffered from\nthe lack of a big idea. Turbulent Landscapes is a suite\npremised on six Turner paintings (thoughtfully\nreproduced in the programme on the evening) but\nit, too, is a concerto for orchestra: Musgrave paints\nwith sounds as Turner with oils and calls on the\nconstituent instrumental colours even more\nexplicitly. The opening \u2018Sunrise with Sea-\nMonsters\u2019 gave a fair indication of what was to\nfollow: it\u2019s an obvious seascape, with a broad sense\nof primal movement beneath the subtleties of its\nsurface chiaroscuro. Thus, too, in \u2018The Shipwreck\u2019\n\u2013 the horns (deliberately?) evoking Peter Grimes \u2013\nthe tension mounts to a violent climax as the\nstorm claims its victim. In \u2018Snow Storm: Hannibal\nand his Army Crossing the Alps\u2019 flutter-tongued\nflutes hover over the heavy tread of muffled low\npercussion and pizzicato basses; a solo horn,\nstanding (Musgrave likes these theatrical touch-\nes), represents Hannibal urging on his men, and\nhesitant fanfares indicate distant Italy. The solo\ntrumpet in \u2018War. The Exile and the Rock Limpet\u2019\nis Napoleon, unsettled, brittle, bitter, the first\nnotes of the Marseillaise recalling his triumphs and\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 65\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nan echo of \u2018God Save the King\u2019 his defeat. More\nsolo lines \u2013 bass clarinet, cor anglais and, especial-\nly, viola \u2013 decorate \u2018God Save the King\u2019 in the\nhorns, but the next player on his feet is the piccolo,\njoined by the flutes: these flickering improvisatory\nlines depict the first of the flames that consumed\nthe Houses of Parliament in 1834. Pregnant with\nlatent power, the orchestra at last unleashes wood-\nwind and percussion as the conflagration bursts\nout, and the heavy brass pitch in to bring the roof\ndown, almost literally \u2013 but horns softly intone the\nnational anthem: all will be well again. Finally, in\n\u2018Sunrise, with a Boat between Headlands\u2019, string\nclusters paint the fog and muted brass chords sug-\ngest \u2018the huge looming cliffs\u2019 (Musgrave\u2019s\nprogramme note). A solo clarinet calls up three\ntrumpets to evoke the sun; mutes off, the brass\npowers Turner\u2019s boat out towards the open sea\nand the music sinks into tranquillity. Musgrave\u2019s\nuse of orchestral soloists and her deliberate sym-\nbolism might seem crude in the necessary\nsummary of a review; experienced as music,\nTurbulent Landscapes is delicate, refined, imagina-\ntive \u2013 not plumbing the emotional reserves of the\nlast orchestral work of hers presented at the\nProms (the soprano song-cycle Songs for a Winter\u2019s\nEvening in 1998), but with its own poetic logic.\nStrauss used Ein Heldenleben to get even with his\ncritics; James MacMillan\u2019s organ concerto A Scotch\nBestiary \u2013 given its first London performance on\n21 July, with the soloist Wayne Marshall and the\ncomposer conducting the BBC Philharmonic \u2013 is\nan elaborate and energetic settling of scores with\nhis own naysayers. Since the work was initially\ncommissioned for the Walt Disney Concert Hall\nin Los Angeles, MacMillan explains, \u2018I was moti-\nvated by the great American cartoon makers who\nrepresented human characters in animal form. A\nScotch Bestiary is inspired by human archetypes\nand personalities encountered in Scottish life over\nthe years\u2019. The subtitle \u2013 \u2018Enigmatic variations on\na zoological carnival at a Caledonian exhibition\u2019 \u2013\ngives the musical game away: MacMillan takes\nleaves from Elgar\u2019s, Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 and Mussorgsky\u2019s\nbooks. The work falls into two sections, the first a\nset of character variations, intermittently linked\nby various treatments of the \u2018Promenade\u2019 from\nMussorgsky\u2019s Pictures, the second a wild and \nfreewheeling fantasy on the material generated in\nthe first. \nIt\u2019s plain MacMillan\u2019s gloves are off from the\nferocious chordal opening, organ, brass and per-\ncussion all piling in like vultures on a kill. His\nvictims aren\u2019t always obvious: quite who are the\n\u2018Reptiles and Big Fish (in a small pond)\u2019 of the sec-\nond episode isn\u2019t revealed explicitly, though the\nlumbering waltz that emerges suggests we should\nnot expect much fleetness of thought. The title of\nthe fourth episode, though \u2013 \u2018The red-handed, no-\nsurrender howler monkey\u2019 \u2013 fingers Scottish\nanti-Catholic prejudice clearly enough for its\nmanic militarism, expressed in a mad Ivesian\nscherzo, to turn its target orange with indigna-\ntion. MacMillan is now on a roll, and the sixth\nepisode aims a slug at the Scottish political estab-\nlishment when a \u2018discarded fanfare for the\nopening of the new Scottish Parliament\u2019 is\nmocked with wow-wow trombone, \u2018accompa-\nnied by bagpipe-like drones and snuffling on the\norgan\u2019; a powerful organ statement sweeps it all\naway disdainfully, perhaps discarding the\nParliament itself. When the organ bookends \u2018The\nReverend Cuckoo and his Parroting Chorus\u2019 (sev-\nenth episode, clarinet stirring the other\nwoodwinds into excitement) with a hymn and the\norchestra sings \u2018Amen\u2019, the Prom audience, enjoy-\ning the scrap like kids around a playground fight,\nlaughed out loud. The eighth and last episode,\n\u2018Jackass Hackass\u2019, is a swirling moto perpetuo,\nwhere MacMillan gets even with us hapless\nscriveners \u2013 two orchestral typewriters make it\nclear whose eye he is jabbing. \nBut if that first section, 20 minutes in length, is\nan essay in epic whimsy, MacMillan reveals a more\nserious purpose in the white-knuckle chase of the\nfantasy which follows, where material from the\nfirst is joined by new \u2018animals\u2019; the humour and\nviolence coalesce in a riot of colour and energy\nthan is far more than simple snook-cocking.\nMacMillan occasionally relaxes the throttle, but\nwhen the music gathers speed for the frenzied\nskelter and fierce organ cadenza of the closing\npages, the thrill is physical as much as musical. As\nComposer\/Conductor of the BBC Philharmonic,\nMacMillan was as obviously at home with his\nmusicians as he was with his music; and, secure in\nthe knowledge that Wayne Marshall would under-\ntake the first performances, threw a demonic solo\npart a him; Marshall despatched it with assured\nconfidence.\nMore animal energy was unleashed on 26 July,\nin the world premi\u00e8re of Detlev Glanert\u2019s\nTheatrum bestiarum, a BBC commission conduct-\ned by John Storg\u00e5rds, replacing the indisposed\nOliver Knussen in front of the BBC Symphony\nOrchestra. Glanert sees the 20-minute work as \u2018a\ndark and wild series of songs and dances for\norchestra, [\u2026] an exploration of dangerous\ndreams and wishes\u2019; its \u2018uncomfortable undertow\u2019\nmakes it \u2018a glimpse into the inner soul of a mon-\nster \u2013 as human beings can become\u2019. Here, too,\nthe organ joins the orchestra in the opening\nm\u00eal\u00e9e, but the sound evaporates instantly, leaving\na lone bass line to splutter out on tuba and organ.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f66\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nDancing figures in the strings try to re-animate the\nmusic; the woodwinds join in and the orchestra\nwhirls into life, and a dance rhapsody burls for-\nward, whooping winds whipping the strings\nalong. The frenetic repeated rhythms point to the\nheritage of Karl Amadeus Hartmann as the music\ngrows increasingly manic, until three huge organ\nchords put a brake on the momentum. The strings\nanswer, pianissimo, introducing a restless\nnightscape illuminated with a myriad points of\nlight; occasional commentary from the organ is\nmet by woozy glissandi from solo violins and a\nhalf-hearted response from the orchestra, and a\nfanfare, gently dying, sings this section to sleep,\nthe cellos dropping off in a sinking melodic line. A\ngentle dissonance in the winds stirs the dawn cho-\nrus, the growing energy again suggesting\nHartmann as a distant inspiration. Organ, percus-\nsion and strings, cleverly scored, egg on the\nmomentum but are silenced by sudden stasis.\nTimpani tattoos, jubilant horns and Rite-like\nstomping try to jab the orchestra into ever more\nviolent life, but the response is a string-quartet\nelegy which spreads into a slow, shimmering\nchord across the orchestra \u2013 and the work stops\ndead in its tracks.\nWith its origins in the score for Fran\u00e7ois\nGirard\u2019s film The Red Violin, John Corigliano\u2019s vio-\nlin concerto of that name, given its UK premi\u00e8re\non 28 July by Joshua Bell and the Bournemouth\nSymphony Orchestra under Marin Alsop, must\nhave been the most widely-heard new music in\nthis year\u2019s Proms season. Corigliano first (in 1997)\nwrote an expansive, romantic chaconne which\nwas needed ahead of time so that the actors could\nsynchronize their hand-movements with the film;\nhaving thus laid his soul bare, he decided it could\nfunction as the opening movement of a full-scale\nconcerto, and the piece \u2013 dedicated to the memo-\nry of Corigliano\u2019s father, erstwhile concertmaster\nof the New York Philharmonic \u2013 was completed in\n2003. The chaconne (at 16 minutes the longest sin-\ngle movement of this 37-minute work) opens with\nthe solo violin twice drawing a swish of colours\nfrom percussion, harp and woodwinds before\ngruff bassoons announce the ground bass, which\nthen recedes from view: during the long, lyrical\nand very lovely exposition you would hardly know\nit is a chaconne, the steady tread asserting itself\nonly slowly. And the acquired dignity is soon dis-\ncarded as the music sets off on a wild chase. The\nwriting for violin is fearsomely virtuosic, with an\nimprovisatory feel \u2013 in this, of all forms. The cli-\nmax, which has a whiff of Prokofiev, doesn\u2019t make\nthe most of the emotion that has been generated,\nand after a ruminative cadenza the brass and per-\ncussion bring back the opening material. \n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 67\nBox office 0121 780 3333\nwww.symphonyhall.co.uk\/boxoffice\nG\nIG\nS4\nU\n \u2022\nG\nIG\nS4\nU\n \u2022\n G\nIG\nS4\nU\n \u2022\nG\nIG\nS4\nU\n \u2022\n G\nIG\nS4\nU\n \u2022\nG\nIG\nS4\nU\n \u2022\n G\nIG\nS4\nU\nFriday 20 January @ 7.30pm\nTallis Scholars\nPeter Phillips director\nSarah Connolly soprano\nVanessa Redgrave narrator *\nGombert Missa Tempore Paschali \nTavener Tribute to Cavafy* \nSymphony Hall Commission - World premi\u00e8re\nFREE Pre-Concert Talk @ 6.15pm\nGIGS4U\nTuesday 7 February @ 7.30pm\nFiddlesticks  \nEnsemblebash director\nMadeleine Mitchell violin\nMusic for percussion and violin by: Lou\nHarrison, Peter Maxwell Davies, Joby\nTalbot, Nigel Osborne, Tarik O\u2019Regan,\nRachel Leach, Simon Limbrick\nFREE Pre-Concert Talk @ 6.15pm\nThursday 30 March @ 7.30pm\nSteve Reich \nRhythm and Movement \nLondon Sinfonietta\nAkram Khan Company*\nBrad Lubman conductor\nAkram Khan choreographer\nSound Intermedia sound design\nSteve Reich \nSextet - Different Trains - Variations \nfor Vibes, Pianos and Strings* (UK Premi\u00e8re) \nFREE Pre-Concert Talk @ 6.15pm\n*commissioned by the European Concert Hall Organisation (ECHO)\nWednesday 19 April @ 7.30pm\nBach Meets Moondog\nBritten Sinfonia\nJoanna MacGregor\npiano\/director \nAndy Sheppard\nsaxophones \nShri Sriram tabla\/flute\/bass \nMike Mondesir bass \nMark Mondesir drums \nMoondog (Louis Hardin) \nSingle Foot; Bumbo; Sextet; Up Broadway; All is Loneliness;\nVoices of Spring; Invocation; Reedroy; Organ Rounds;\nSymphonique No 6,Good for Goodie;Frankanon; Heath on\nthe Heather (arr.

Harmonics in the\nviolin are answered with a hint of orientalism in\npercussion and woodwind. The violin resumes its\ncatch-me-if-you-can with the orchestra, and the\nmusic rushes upwards and disappears. The follow-\ning Andante flautando opens with a broad cello\nmelody, to which the soloist appends his own\nextended, plangent thoughts. The troubled lyri-\ncism brings clear echoes of the Samuel Barber\nConcerto; unlike that work, and despite the beauty\nof the string-writing, the ideas are not adequately\nsustained. The rhythmically dislocated finale is\nanother wild hunt, soloist and orchestra barrelling\nonwards at different tempi, the brass whooping\nand percussion banging defiance, soloist and\norchestral strings pressing crunches out of the\ninstruments. The tension falls and oboe and flute\nunfold a sad nocturne, encouraging one of the\nsoloist\u2019s loveliest melodies so far. The opening cha-\nconne balefully returns, sparking excited\ncommentary from the violin. A percussion-accom-\npanied cadenza stirs up more crunching and,\nprefaced by percussion thuds, a final whoop from\nthe violin closes the concerto \u2013 which is not quite\nthe sum, I fear, of its estimable parts.\nHans Abrahamsen\u2019s Four Pieces for Orchestra\n(UK premi\u00e8re on 1 August) began life as the first\nfour of his 10 Studies for Piano in 1983: \u2018Tr\u00e4umlied\u2019,\n\u2018Sturm\u2019, \u2018Arabesque\u2019 and \u2018Ende\u2019; even then they\nwere intended to \u2018recall the German Romantic era\nfull of expression, night, timelessness, dream and\nthe irrational\u2019 and he already foresaw them\nexpanded for full orchestra. In the long run (that\nexpansion took place in 2000\u20133) he requires 107\nplayers, among them two harps, guitar, mandolin,\ntwo contrabassoons, bass trumpet, four Wagner\ntubas, two normal ones and a forest of percussion;\nbetween Sibelius\u2019s Third Symphony and Brahms\u2019s\nSecond Piano Concerto, this was indeed a pro-\ngramming indulgence \u2013 especially since, in this\nconcert of Ilan Volkov and the BBC Scottish, the\nplayers would have to have been transported\ndown from Glasgow. But Abrahamsen uses his\nhuge resources as sparingly as Mahler \u2013 and to\ntremendous effect: the range of colours was daz-\nzling. The magister in absentia is clearly Berg, the\nfigure where once before the heritage of the\nRomantic ethos fused with atonality. The shifting\nchords of \u2018Tr\u00e4umlied\u2019, built on a phrase of\nWebernian brevity and allowed to echo into the\ndistance, are charged with gently suggestive\nstrength. \u2018Sturm\u2019 boils from the start, spluttering\nangrily and soon whirling into a modernist re-\nwriting of the Storm from Peter Grimes: the\nparallels are striking. The twisting lines of\n\u2018Arabesque\u2019, brighter than any of the preceding\ntextures, twinkle and flicker in textures of\nDebussyan lightness. And \u2018Ende\u2019, incorporating\nsilence into the deeper recesses of the orchestra\nand juxtaposing it with occasional surges of\nchordal colour, proved a deeply subtle psychologi-\ncal essay. Of all the new music on my watch this\nyear, this was by far the most impressive piece.\nThe world premi\u00e8re of Huw Watkins\u2019s Double\nConcerto for the unusual combination of viola and\ncello occupied the centre-spot of the Prom on 4\nAugust; the violist Philip Dukes and cellist\nJosephine Knight, both of them first-rate musi-\ncians, were joined by the BBC National Orchestra\nof Wales under the alert baton of Jac van Steen.\nThe concerto begins with a brief fusillade of\ndemisemiquavers from the violins, underpinned\nby the bass drum and capped by flourishes from\nthe soloists. A viola solo (sola?), high in the register,\nbrings a hint of Celtic dance; the cello responds\nless assertively, before the duo and string-dominat-\ned orchestra exchange material in a wild allegro.\nIndeed, the repeated bursts of toccata-like writ-\ning, occasionally animated by a brittle humour,\nsuggest that the entire movement functions as a\npreludial toccata of sorts, with a calm and sadly\nlyrical postlude for the duo. The elegiac tone thus\nset up continues into the central Adagio, the\nsoloists rhapsodizing contrapuntally, braving\nbrisker interjections from trumpets and trom-\nbones to suggest a loss felt jointly, the sense of pain\nmaintained into the closing bars, where the phras-\nes run out, unfinished. Bass drum and double\nbassoon support the beginnings of a dance, which\nthe duo seems to be trying to recover from the\ndepths of memory. Tempo and power gradually\nincrease, establishing a stomping rhythm. But the\nonward drive drops back for a wistful reverie until\nthe bell-crested orchestra insists again, growing\never more excited under the tumbling, intertwin-\ning lines of the soloists. Finally, they too get the\nidea and wrong-foot it enthusiastically to the \nsudden conclusion.\nMartin Anderson\nProms 2005 (2): Unsuk Chin, Sorensen, Hayes,\nSalonen\nOn 10 August Kent Nagano and The Deutsches\nSymphonie-Orchestra Berlin with Christiane\nOelze gave the European premi\u00e8re of Unsuk\nChin\u2019s snagS and Snarls, settings of texts by Lewis\nCarroll with additions by the composer. There are,\nof course, no moral imperatives about these sorts\nof things, but it seems that anybody setting Carroll\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f68\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nshould tread very carefully, especially if not a native\nspeaker. The word setting in the last movement,\n\u2018Speak softly to your little boy,\u2019 was supposed to be\nunnatural and distorted for (presumably comic)\neffect, but in fact it was no more so than that of the\nfirst, a setting of \u2018A boat beneath a sunny sky,\u2019 the\ndedicatory poem which has Alice Liddell\u2019s name\nembedded in it as the first letter of every line,\nwhere the intention was clearly to set the words in\nan absolutely straightforward manner. The music\nof \u2018The Alice acrostic,\u2019 as that movement was enti-\ntled, was evocative, sweetly \u2018old-fashioned\u2019 and\ngentle, but the voice-part was likely to sprout\nmelismas at any moment, however inopportune it\nmight be in relationship to the text, to no particu-\nlarly good end. \u2018The long and sad tale\u2019 of the\nmouse after the caucus race was set to music which\nwas supposed to mimic the graphic character of\nthe text as Carroll printed it, with phrases that start-\ned loud and got softer and also got progressively\nhigher and shorter, but this attribute was not par-\nticularly clear aurally. Contractions in Carroll\u2019s text\nwere changed back into separate words, which\nblithe disregard for its scansion. \u2018Twinkle, twinkle,\nlittle bat,\u2019 the fourth movement, had lots of addi-\ntional text by Chin, starting from the well-known\nnursery rhyme which was Carroll\u2019s reference and\nelaborating on it. It was a frenetically crazy patter\nsong with a refrain of nonsense words supplied by\nthe composer. \nAll of the music throughout the piece was\nappealing, but it wasn\u2019t ever really funny. A singer\nwho made contact with the audience and really\npresented the piece might have been able to make\nit charming and amusing, but Ms. Oelze, as if giv-\ning an impression of a singer filling in at the last\nmoment, had to work very hard to keep her head\nabove water, singing directly to her music stand\nand conducting herself practically the whole time,\nand didn\u2019t help anything. Even though the orches-\ntration was attractive and skilful, particularly in\nrespect to the balance between the voice and the\norchestra, it would probably have been more suc-\ncessful had it been for saxophone or flute or\nclarinet and orchestra.\nThe concert by the Danish National Orchestra\nand Thomas Dausgaard on 12 August included\nthe first performance of The Little Mermaid by\nBent Sorensen. The work is for three girl\u2019s chorus-\nes (the Danish National Girls Choir), high soprano\n(Inger Dam-Jensen), and tenor (Gert Henning-\nJensen), with orchestra. Hans Christian Andersen\nwrote his story The Little Mermaid soon after the\nwedding of a friend with whom he had an unrecip-\nrocated passionate attachment, and the story\u2019s\ntheme of unrequited love and renunciation is\nthought to reflect his own feelings at the time. In\nSorensen\u2019s piece, one of the three strands of the\nmusic is the choruses (placed in different parts of\nthe room), presenting the narrative (or at least\nsuggesting it); another is the soprano as the mer-\nmaid, telling the story in first person and present\ntense; and the third is the tenor who sings excerpts\nfrom Andersen\u2019s diaries, initially only obliquely\nrelated to the story. At the climax of the work, the\ntenor and the soprano sing the same words, join-\ning the mermaid\u2019s story with Andersen\u2019s. The\nmusic is extremely quiet practically all the time,\nthe pitch language fairly simple. The writing for\nthe choruses is intricate, mellifluous, and delicate,\naccompanied with shimmering music in the\norchestra. Around the climactic part the orches-\ntral music gets lower and much more agitated, but\nhardly louder. The delicacy and quietness of the\nwork as a whole suggests a sort of siren\u2019s song.\nThe vocal writing is always extremely effective,\nboth for soloists and choruses. The whole work\nwas understatedly beautiful and moving, and the\nplaying and singing was about as good as anybody\ncould ever imagine or wish.\nOn the BBC Symphony concert on 25 August,\nwhich contained the first performance of the\nBBC-commissioned Strip by Morgan Hayes,\nJoseph Swensen filled in on very short notice for\nan indisposed Sir Andrew Davis. The title of\nHayes\u2019s work is intended to have a number of dif-\nferent implications, including that its material is\nlayered, in strips, and that its music is stripped-\ndown, reduced to its simplest means. The work is\nin a modernistic, non-tonal style, bristling with\ncomplicated rhythms and quarter-tone inflected\nmelody, and is scored for a large orchestra replete\nwith an extensive percussion section plus cim-\nbalom, harmonium, and piano four hands. \nStrip began with a repeating grid of non-tuned\npercussion music, over which is soon suspended\ndissonant longish chords. The percussion\nrhythms migrate into cellos and basses, acquiring\npitches. Eventually intense and active melodic\nlines flower, most memorably in a more extended\nsection for two solo violins early on in the piece.\nFollowing the unfolding of its initial progress each\nof the disparate elements of the work expands fur-\nther in range and instrumentation as the texture is\nincreasingly stratified and simplified. The prep-\naration of the performance had been impeded by\nDavis\u2019s illness, and it was clearly inadequate.\nExactly how much it undermined the clarity and\nstrength of the work\u2019s arc is a question that the\nnext performance will have to answer. In a better\nperformance, though, Strip might have a clearer\nand more convincing progress to it and might\nseem less static and inconclusive. \nThe World Orchestra for Peace can only be\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 69\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ndescribed as an all-star group. Its players are drawn\nfrom major orchestras from all over the world; as\nan example, of the 15 members of the first violin\nsection, 12 are concertmasters of their regular\norchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic,\nthe Israel Philharmonic, the Helsinki Phil-\nharmonic, and the orchestra of the Royal Opera,\nCovent Garden. The group was founded by Sir\nGeorge Solti, and after his death in 1997, Valery\nGergiev became the conductor. \nThe orchestra\u2019s Prom concert on 27 August\nincluded the first performance of Helix, a work\nwritten for them on a BBC commission by Esa-\nPekka Salonen. Salonen described Helix, which is\nof about nine minutes duration, as being like a spi-\nral or a cone. The tempo of the piece is always\nincreasing, but the note values of the main parts\nbecome correspondingly longer, so that the\nimpression is of an acceleration of speed of figu-\nration, but not of tempo. The mood of the work\nchanges progressively from the hazy, languorous\nquality of the beginning to the busy, manic, and\nvery loud character of the end. The work was\nclearly written with the virtuosic abilities of the\namazing players of the orchestra in mind. Salonen\nhas worked with many of them for years and\nknows their playing very well, and he had written\nthat he felt that the project was a more personal\nundertaking that usual.\nRodney Lister \nProms 2005 (3): Gubaidulina, Ad\u00e8s, Turnage\nThe Light of the End, Sofia Gubaidulina\u2019s 2003 piece\nfor large orchestra, which received its UK pre-\nmi\u00e8re on 20 August from the LPO under the\ndirection of Kurt Masur, is a work that looks like\nsomething of a departure for its 73 year-old com-\nposer. Denying any religious influences in its\norigin, Gubaidulina spoke at her pre-Prom inter-\nview instead of the \u2018conflict\u2019 between natural and\ntempered tunings as the source of the piece.\nInterestingly it is the familiar tempered tuning\nthat the composer, at least here, seems to regard as\nthe dark force. \u2018Nature is neutralized\u2019 through this\nman-made compromise, as she somewhat eccen-\ntrically sees it.\nAlthough the piece begins in familiar\nGubaidulina \u2018colourist\u2019 territory, with slow solo\nflutes and alto flute supported by harp harmonics;\nviolent upsurges from the strings quickly lead the\nway for the horns, playing loudly and raucously in\ntheir natural pitch, to stand in aggressive contrast.\nDespite Gubaidulina\u2019s claim that the title came\n\u2018only from the bright sound of the antique cym-\nbals that bring the coda of the piece to a close\u2019, the\ncustomary religious atmosphere of her works is\nnever far away. Immediately after the opening the\nstring surgings, now joined by woodwind, are stat-\nically contrasted with a serious, almost\nchorale-like series of passages in the lower strings.\nWhen the divisi string sounds stop abruptly after\nan fff chord and trumpet-led brass come in with\nmighty fanfares, the piece takes on a mystical\natmosphere that it never really abandons. \nThe composer\u2019s stated desire to \u2018mine the dark\nside\u2019 involves, or so it seems, the juxtaposition of\nheaven (in a rather Messiaen-like halo of trum-\npets), earth (all the endless, aimless surgings) and\nthe deep (those solid, heavy string passages).\nFanciful though this reading of Gubaidulina\u2019s the-\nology might be, one can\u2019t help noticing how the\npervasive atmosphere of the piece \u2013 particularly in\nits early sections \u2013 is a ruminative setting of con-\ntrasting sounds and textures against one another.\nUnder Masur, the LPO was complicit in this: play-\ning with precision and care, but not, even in the\nwork\u2019s more dramatic later sections, giving\nenough pace to achieve the strength and flow that\nwe get in Gubaidulina\u2019s Viola Concerto or\nSymphony.\nIt is the middle sections of the piece\u2019s 23-\nminute span that are most successful. In the first\nGubaidulina brings her richly-coloured orchestral\nforces together for the first time, so that a lively\ndancing string melody is counterpointed by a\nswirling figure dominated by bar chimes. Brass\ntake up the strings\u2019 ever-more urgent rhythm\nbefore a sensuous, thrilling full orchestral climax.\nIf some of Gubaidulina\u2019s writing for snarling\ntrombones, stratospheric horns and the colours of\na large percussion section is occasionally over-\nindulged, the work\u2019s heart \u2013 a duet for solo\n(tempered) cello and (natural) solo horn is effec-\ntive because of the simplicity of the material given\nto them. The stripped-down music brings out the\nhorn\u2019s free, raw, primitive quality against the\ncello\u2019s passionate but vibrato-heavy and rather\nsophisticated tones. Not so much darkness against\nlight, more the raw and the cooked.\nHowever the drama of this contrast is lost\namidst the sheer welter of colours in\nGubaidulina\u2019s complex and busy orchestral writ-\ning; and so her central argument is dissipated. It is\nonly later, after a few longeurs, that we hear such\neffective dramatic conflict again. The great coup\nof the final section is when the brass break out in\nall directions across the landscape in an\nunchecked, \u2018natural\u2019 moment, bells pealing\nbehind. So has the \u2018natural\u2019 won? Yes, if we listen\nto the sweeping glissandos of an ecstatic solo cello\nand strings disappearing into the ether, harps and\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f70\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nglockenspiels accompanying them to a familiar\nheaven. Beautiful, visionary and light-filled cer-\ntainly, yet where is the battle from which this\ntriumph has come? \nThere is a winning simplicity about Thomas\nAd\u00e8s\u2019s recently completed first Violin Concerto,\ngiven its UK premi\u00e8re with the composer himself\nconducting on 6 September, only two days after its\nworld premi\u00e8re in Berlin with the Chamber\nOrchestra of Europe and Anthony Marwood as\nsoloist. Ad\u00e8s supplied an unrevealing 76-word pro-\ngramme-note (unlike Gubaidulina, he eschews\nexplanatory words about the motives behind his\nworks) and subtitled the work Concentric Paths.\nLikewise, each of the three movements has a sim-\nple if not especially enlightening title (\u2018Rings\u2019,\n\u2018Paths\u2019 and \u2018Rounds\u2019), but the directness of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s\nstyle means that any more explanation of the\nmusic\u2019s designs would be superfluous.\nIn \u2018Rings\u2019, the opening quick movement, the\nsoloist plays almost without a pause, mostly in a\nhigh register, often in rapid similar semiquaver\npatterns alternating higher and lower notes to cre-\nate a \u2018circling\u2019 effect. The orchestra joins in this\nhard-driven near-perpetuum mobile movement,\ncontinuing the soloist\u2019s own patterns and then just\nas quickly returning to an accompanying role to\nlet the violin\u2019s repeated figures come to the fore.\nThe metal percussion, sparingly used trumpets,\nflutes and piccolos add to the movement\u2019s gos-\nsamer texture and motoric energy, while metal\nguiro and small cans drive it breathtakingly to its\nend.\nAfter the almost Baroque technique of \u2018Rings\u2019,\nthe slow movement \u2018Paths\u2019 shows \u2013 appropriately\n\u2013 soloist and orchestra on different tracks. The\norchestra opens with stark jumpy chords. The vio-\nlin, on edge, is forced for the first time into\nsubterranean depths and rhythmically complex\nfigures, leaps and runs as the trombone and tuba\npursue it over sullen ground. At figure 18, as if\nhurt and defiant, the soloist has a passage in its\nlowest register, marcato as the orchestra play ppp;\nthe orchestra rejoins, still quieted, the trumpets\nand horns making a woeful buzzing sound\nthrough their Harman mutes. The long rhapsodic\nsolo passage at the centre of this movement and\nwhich continues to the double-bass and timpani-\naccompanied end is distinguished not only by its\ntenderness but also by how Ad\u00e8s succeeds in writ-\ning such compelling music out of repeated\n\u2018cyclical\u2019 patterns by slowly varying mood and\nshape, without ever being tempted into becoming\ntricksy or gratuitous. \nThe last movement takes us back, with its\ndrums and flautando strings, to the Mayan drum-\nming of America: A Prophecy (2000) and for a while\nAd\u00e8s seems content to let the violin once more\nhold high notes while the orchestra provides the\nmain interest. But no \u2013 the soloist has other\ndevices: a syncopated line, an angular double- and\ntriple-stopped one and finally a race towards and\nsudden thump of a surprise ending. The compos-\ner describes the atmosphere of this last movement\nas being \u2018playful, at ease\u2019. While it is neither (and is\nthe least successful movement), its brevity and the\nold-fashioned excitement of seeing the soloist\nnegotiate some tricky running passages make the\nappeal of the work as whole more straightforward\nthan Asyla (1997) which has thus far established\nitself as Ad\u00e8s\u2019s most admired orchestral score.\nWhereas one sometimes wonders what logic gov-\nerns the sequences in Asyla\u2019s madhouse, the\nsoloist\u2019s prominence and the focus that gives to\nthis new 20-minute piece, the absence of mere\nshow and the work\u2019s sheer slickness make it a real\n\u2018Concerto Conciso\u2019 which will, I am sure, contin-\nue to bear aloft the multi-hued torch of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s\nreputation.\nH\u00e5kan Hardenberger, the pre-eminent trum-\npeter of our time, has been responsible for\ninspiring a number of commissions for his instru-\nment (not least from HK Gruber, Harrison\nBirtwistle and Sally Beamish). On 9 September he\nappeared as soloist in Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s\nnew trumpet concerto, another work that had\ncome to the Proms just a few days after its world\npremi\u00e8re by its co-commissioners the Helsinki PO\nunder Esa-Pekka Salonen. \nHardenberger has collaborated with Turnage\nbefore. Dispelling the Fears, Turnage\u2019s 1995 double\ntrumpet concerto, in fact began the process of col-\nlaboration that prompted the Swede to request a\nsingle-trumpet concerto; this new piece, entitled\nFrom the Wreckage, is the result. Turnage\u2019s style has\nmoved on somewhat in the last 20 years, as he is\nthe first to acknowledge. Although the double\nconcerto is only ten years old, it has less of a range\nthan the new piece. Where the earlier concerto\nwas more aggressive and brass-dominated in tex-\nture, with the solo instruments heard mostly in\ntheir more vociferous and extravert mode, here\nthe composer attempts to exploit both a wider\nregister and breadth of tone; so much so that the\nsolo part calls additionally or the soloist to play the\nflugelhorn and piccolo trumpet alongside the\nusual instrument.\nUnlike Ad\u00e8s, Turnage makes no secret of his\nwork\u2019s source or references \u2013 from a particularly\ndark time in the composer\u2019s life \u2013 while the snare-\ndrums (which surround the orchestra at all four\ncompass points) play their cross-stick \u2018ticking\u2019 pat-\nterns in all too evident symbolism of time passing.\nIndeed the 16-minute piece \u2018darkness to light\u2019 pro-\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 71\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\ngression can readily be read off the composer\u2019s\nown markings in the score, so that we begin\n\u2018veiled and spiky\u2019 \u2013 with a nervy flugelhorn \u2013 but\nquickly progress to a \u2018more subdued and desolate\u2019\nsection where Turnage\u2019s blues influences \u2013 his\ntrumpeter heroes are Miles Davis and other jazz\ngreats \u2013 cast a distinctively cool light. Mixing gen-\nres, however, has never been easy for any\ncomposer: and in drawing on the type of jazz\ntrumpet playing that represents a subdued or\nuncertain mood, Turnage has written a solo part\nthat often feels rambling and lacking purpose \u2013\neven when, after only a few minutes, the soloist\nswitches from the mellow flugelhorn to the C\ntrumpet and continues on it until near the end.\nIndeed, in the switch of tempo to the crotch-\net=96 central section, marked \u2018constant\nmovement\u2019, the interest and vigour is largely\nachieved by Turnage\u2019s characteristic energetic\nwriting for timpani and brake drums; the trum-\npet\u2019s high-tessitura quick figurations sound\nsimply shrill in their persistence, and for all\nHardenberger\u2019s brilliance to make his instrument\nsound \u2018flute-like\u2019 (at Fig. 17), this is simply impos-\nsible. The most impressive and liberating writing\noccurs in the semi-improvised 19-bar section, and\nit seems a shame that Turnage\u2019s plan for a cadenza\nwas dropped from the earlier version of the score. \nWhen, towards the end of the piece, in the sec-\ntions marked \u2018aggressive\u2019 and then \u2018rowdy\u2019, the\npiccolo trumpet is counterpointed by a strong\nbrass and string rhythm in a manner reminiscent\nof Dispelling the Fears, one concludes that\nTurnage\u2019s broader latter-day scope hasn\u2019t all been\nfor the best. Yet the ending does leave one satis-\nfied: over soft sustained string chords the piccolo\ntrumpet repeats its plaintive cry while the clock-\nlike percussion cut remorselessly in.

The magic worked. \nAristophanes\u2019 play centres on the pithy social\nbanter of two Athenians, Euelpides and\nPeithetairus, who bid to escape the petty tribula-\ntions of urban life and imperial Athenian\narrogance. Glyn Maxwell\u2019s atmospheric text com-\npressed these into a single human figure, dubbed\nPitcher (\u2018a vessel stuck on the earth \u2026 a man toss-\ning out ideas.\u2019) \nThe evening\u2019s tour-de-force \u2013 besides some\nthrilling lighting by Charles Balfour and intricate\ndesigns by Soutra Gilmour \u2013 was the magnificent\ncentral performance by Glenville Hargreaves.\nThis declaimed role requires an heroic feat of\nmemory and rhythmic ingenuity. Hargreaves tow-\nered throughout, gripping the audience from the\noutset: tetchy, moody, nervous, wheedling, sym-\npathetic, insistent and bossy; but always engaging. \nTaped sounds of city traffic and passing sirens\nare gradually stilled as soft, alluring chords well up\nin the chorus (\u2018Restless man, awhile be still\u2019).\nPossibly this is what the piece is about: not just a\nwheeze of social engineering, but a deeper yearn-\ning for a spiritual escape, much as Walter Braunfels\nconceived it in his sumptuous neo-Romantic\nGerman opera The Birds a century earlier. \nHughes\u2019s (often nine-part) choral writing is by\nturns blistering and soothing, just as the instru-\nmental underlay is both lulling and frenetic.\nPitcher emerges to a patter of twittering cow\nbells, temple blocks and tom-toms; the wide-inter-\nvalled cello line for the Hoopoe (Giles\nUnderwood as the birds\u2019 affable leader) supplied\nan attractive contrast, as did Robert Rice\u2019s long-\nsuffering Vulture and a high-tessitura assault by\nthe hostile Crow (the splendid Carys Lane), the\nensuing a cappella chorus and beguiling pattern-\nings for cello and marimba as Pitcher starts\nwooing the birds.\nMaxwell\u2019s fourth scene echoes the point in\nAristophanes where interlopers from Earth\ninvade the birds\u2019 new castle in the sky. Here\nHughes\u2019s rhythms grow ever more syncopated: in\nplace of jumped-up Athenian officials, the unwel-\ncome intruders are a rock star (mezzo), a PR man,\na guru (countertenor) and a clutch of other \u2018para-\nsites\u2019. This yields to an effective pow-wow for\nCrow and Owl (Simon Wall), a cello solo, a nifty\n\u2018council\u2019 scene and a striking slow invocation by\nthe now acquiescent Crow. A rainbow heralds the\ndescent of Iris, heaven\u2019s messenger ( Julie\nCooper), bearing the Gods\u2019 order to rip down the\nwall: her arrival provides another scintillating con-\ntrast; likewise (in contrast to the dramatic out-\nburst as war bulletins fly in from ever corner) the\nunexpectedly stilled Scene 10, \u2018Holy war\u2019, sung\nvirtually as an Adagio. \nMaxwell\u2019s almost pointillistic text \u2013 a cheerfully\ncheeky filleting of Aristophanes\u2019 longest play \u2013\nsomehow skirts pretentiousness. When Pitcher\ndemands \u2018What hides behind a star? Can we trust\nthe galaxies?\u2019 or the choir intones \u2018Ship that can\nonly sail, sun that can only rise, year that can only\nturn\u2019, lured into this extraordinary, fussing aviary\nby a staging as compelling as this, you accepted its\nirony on its own terms. Fulljames\u2019s staging was\nmesmerizing, the cast utterly committed, I\nFagiolini\u2019s singing and intoning first rate, and the\nmusic with its myriad swirling patterns beautiful-\nly underlined each move. A joyously bizarre piece\nof theatre \u2013 as Aristophanes should be. The audi-\nence was besotted. An enchanted evening.\nRoderic Dunnett\nManchester, Bridgewater Hall: John Casken\u2019s\nRest-Ringing (and CD releases)\nRest-ringing, John Casken\u2019s new work for string\nquartet and orchestra, was written for, dedicated\nto, and premi\u00e8red on 19 May 2005 by the Lindsay\nQuartet, accompanied by the Hall\u00e9 orchestra\nunder Mark Elder\u2019s baton. The title apparently\ncame to Casken after he mis-read an advert adver-\ntising piano restringing; the addition of the\nhyphen alludes to the legacy of the Lindsay\u2019s \u2018ring-\ning on\u2019 after their retirement. Some of this\nword-play seems to have infused the music too, by\nvirtue of the bell-sounds and similar metallic\nsounds that occur at key moments.\nA case in point is the opening of the work, which\nCasken describes as \u2018exotic\u2019. Twittering woodwind\nand delicate orchestral strings are coloured by\nmetallic percussion, providing a background for\ndelicate arabesques from the solo string quartet.\nThis serves as something of a curtain-raiser for an\nanimated section in which the quartet provide\ndance-like material in rhythmic unison. The\norchestra\u2019s role is largely one of accompaniment:\nthe light but often intricate textures and intertwin-\ning melodic fragments allude to the chamber\nmusic tradition to which the string quartet\nbelongs. Thus although the orchestra provides\nshifting colours and textures against which to fore-\nground the quartet\u2019s material, it never asserts itself\nas an equal partner in the unfolding dialogue. This\ndoes not preclude it being used to provide formal\narticulation, such as when a short outburst causes\nthe string quartet to divide into canonic pairs. \n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 73\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe idea of a concertante instrument (or group\nof instruments) progressing through a changing\nmusical terrain is common to a number of\nCasken\u2019s works. Ghosts of formal archetypes\noften haunt these soundscapes, although their\nprecise identification are often elusive. In the case\nof Rest-ringing, there are hints of an \u2018all-in-one\u2019\nsymphonic structure, for the dance-like material is\nfollowed by a slower section characterized by\nrhapsodic lines given to the quartet, and a devel-\nopmental scherzo section. In lieu of a\nfinale\/recapitulation, there is a \u2018still centre\u2019, con-\ntaining one of the most memorable moments of\nthe work: slowly descending and bell-like chords,\nmoving at different speeds in the orchestra and\nquartet. From here, there is a brief review to the\ncharacter of the scherzo, and a short coda featur-\ning a cadenza for the leader of the quartet,\naccompanied by a sustained chord from the back\ndesks of the orchestral strings. A reversal of for-\ntune, representing the continually surprising and\naffirmative qualities of the Lindsays, results in a\nsudden re-energizing of the quartet and orchestra\nfor half a minute or so: the music appears, at the\nend, to be cut-off mid flow. \nHowever, the formal plan outlined above only\nhints at what happens, for the \u2018exotic\u2019 introduc-\ntion emerges at two important junctures in the\nwork: just before the first scherzo, and after the\n\u2018still centre\u2019. Considered as a ritornello, it\nstrengthens the identification of Rest-ringing as a\nconcerto grosso, and indeed, Casken envisages\nthe work being performed by the leaders of the\nstring sections. It is difficult, though, to imagine\nthat the piece could be effectively performed by ad\nhoc quartets of this nature. The Lindsays\u2019 per-\nformance, aided by the unfailingly sensitive\nsupport from the Hall\u00e9, carried the conviction of\ndecades of mutual music-making. Indeed, the\npiece as a whole is chamber music on the grandest\nscale: one hopes that this does not ultimately deter\nother ensembles and orchestras taking the music\non in future.\nBefore writing the work, Casken studied a\nnumber of pieces for quartet and orchestra, which\nheightened his awareness of the rarity of the com-\nbination, and the problems of balance. The\ndelicacy with which the orchestra was deployed\nwas one way in which Casken addressed this issue;\nthe frequent use of the quartet in unison another.\nA similar solution can be heard in Distant\nVariations for saxophone quartet and wind orches-\ntra (1996), a recording of which has recently been\nreleased as part of \u2018Night Fire Sun Silence\u2019,\nMetier\u2019s 2-CD set of Casken\u2019s music (MSV\nCD92076). \nIn contrast to the relatively \u2018abstract\u2019 Rest-ring-\ning, most of the works on the release draw on\nextramusical stimuli. Thus Distant Variations com-\nbines an underlying formal archetype (the\nvariations of the title) with a shifting musical ter-\nrain inspired by sunrise at Grand Canyon to\nprovide the background for the concertante\ngroup. Just as the string quartet in Rest-ringing\nevokes the intimacy of chamber music, the use of\nsaxophones in Distant Variations gives rise to an\nurban sound-world in which jazzy elements pro-\nliferate. A sharper distinction between musical\nlandscapes can be heard in the wonderful Infanta\nMarina, in which a solo cor anglais is situated\nmusically and physically between a Debussy-like\ntrio of flute, viola and harp on one side, and a\nmore strident trio of clarinet, horn and double\nbass on the other. The sense of drama \u2013 almost\ntheatrical \u2013 that pervades Casken\u2019s concertante\nmusic is heightened here, for the soloist\u2019s role is\nforever changing. At times independent, at others\ninfluenced by one group or other, and sometimes\nmediating between the two trios, the cor anglais\nrepresents Marina from Shakespeare\u2019s Pericles, fil-\ntered through a poem by Wallace Stevens. But\nInfanta Marina is not ( just) a character study:\nCasken\u2019s fine ear for texture and colour, combined\nwith a compelling musical logic ensures that this is\none of the highlights of the disc.\nThe translation of the extramusical into the\nmusical is no less impressive in Amarantos,\nFirewhirl and Salamandra, the three oldest pieces\nrepresented in the Metier release. Although\nCasken\u2019s musical voice is less distinctive in these\nearly works, and perhaps occasionally over-reliant\non textural affects, the intensity of the latter two\npieces \u2013 perhaps a reflection of the fire imagery\ncentral to their conception \u2013 is gripping, particu-\nlarly in the case of Firewhirl. \nOne can detect a different approach in Apr\u00e8s un\nsilence, the most recent work on the disc, written\nafter \u2018almost a year of not composing\u2019.\nQuestioning the experience of silence, and how\none deals with expression after that silence, gave\nCasken the framework for the piece: the musical\nlogic is just as concerned with how one develops\nthe opening idea. The craftsman-like working-out\nreflects the cooler classicism of Casken\u2019s more\nrecent music; nevertheless, the alternations of agi-\ntated recitative-like sections with calm lyrical\nsections show that this is not at the expense of\nimmediacy of affect. Both versions of the piece \u2013\nthe original for violin and piano, and the arrange-\nment for violin and chamber orchestra \u2013 are\ncontained in the release. Not only does this pro-\nvide a fascinating contrast in terms of colour and\ntexture, but the readings of the solo violinists\noffers different interpretative perspectives.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f74\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nare always magical. Special mention must be\nmade of an evening concert by the excellent\nPresteigne Festival Orchestra and Canterbury\nCathedral Choir under Vass featuring impressive-\nly cogent performances of Tippett\u2019s Little Music\nfor strings, Alan Rawsthorne\u2019s alluringly Arcadian\nConcertante Pastorale and culminating in a per-\nformance of Cecilia McDowall\u2019s graceful\nMagnificat. This reflective work, adorned with\ndeft, Baroque flourishes, has already been record-\ned by the choir, soloists and conductor (Dutton\nCDLX7146)1 and their assured singing radiated\nwith the confidence of a team with this elegant\nchoral piece in their blood.\nAnother treat featured John McCabe with the\nDante Quartet in Elgar\u2019s Piano Quintet and Krysia\nOsostowicz in Rawsthorne\u2019s expertly crafted and\nbafflingly overlooked Violin Sonata. The other\nitems in the programme, David Matthews\u2019s deli-\ncately scored Little Serenade, op.16 and Robin\nHolloway\u2019s ripely Romantic Lento for string quar-\ntet, were classic examples of the refreshingly\napproachable, but skilfully fashioned works this\nfestival features so strongly. \nThe highlight was a song recital presenting two\nworld premi\u00e8res with a local resonance commis-\nsioned by the Presteigne Festival. Both pieces\ngerminated from \u2018A Garland for Presteigne\u2019\n(2003), where ten composers associated with the\nfestival each wrote one short song celebrating the\nWelsh border country. John McCabe and Cecilia\nMcDowall have developed their contributions\ninto substantial song-cycles, with words by cele-\nbrated local poets Jo Shapcott and Simon Mundy.\nJohn McCabe\u2019s settings of Gladestry Quatrains\nwere as pithy and epigrammatic as Jo Shapcott\u2019s\n12 short poems, which charted local and human\nlandscapes with great wit and poignancy. These\nwryly observed verses were pointed up by occa-\nsionally soaring vocal lines, whilst the piano\naccompaniments, sensitively moulded by Paul\nPlummer, were sharply-etched. Ethereal, sus-\ntained chords conjured up distant tolling church\nbells in \u2018Dolyhir\u2019, whilst thunderous, dark chords\netched \u2018serious black clouds\u2019 surrounding Burl\nHill and Newchurch. Elsewhere, the style ranged\nfrom crisp, toccata-like figurations introducing\n\u2018Hergest\u2019, to a delightful chant-like mini-proces-\nsional in \u2018Song in the Shed\u2019 where \u2018every day is\nSunday\u2019. \nThe resulting 20-minute work offered strongly\ncharacterized and fastidiously fashioned settings,\nmatching the range and depth of the poems, from\nthe intimacy of a shared joke to the touching\n1 Reviewed in Tempo Vol.59 No.232 (April 2005), p.85 \u2013 Ed.\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 75\nAlso included on the disc is Casken\u2019s virtuosic\nand highly-charged Piano Quartet, which in part\nrelates to his first opera Golem. The Virgin Classics\nrecording of the latter has recently been re-\nreleased on the NMC Ancora label (NMC D113),\nand a welcome return it is too. The elemental\npower of the Golem, fashioned from earth, and\nthe relationship between the creator and created,\nis an intensification of the themes apparent in the\nworks on \u2018Night Fire Sun Silence\u2019 as well. The\nmusic is as intricately crafted as one might expect\nfrom Casken, who demonstrates unfailing capaci-\nty to draw fascinating and arresting colours and\ntextures from an 11-strong ensemble. A restrained\nuse of an electronic tape part further enriches the\nsoundworld. As with the other works considered\nabove, an underlying formal scheme (a prelude\nfollowed by a fugue) is used to structure the musi-\ncal events. The immediate model for this is Billy\nBudd, rather than Wozzeck, although the theme of\nan outcast ultimately driven to murder, along with\nthe general Expressionistic manner of presenta-\ntion, is obviously similar to Berg\u2019s opera. The\nintensity of the performance, by the original cast\nand conductor, is compelling, leaving me to reflect\nthat Golem must count as one of the most vital\nBritish operas of the 1980s. \nEdward Venn \nPresteigne Festival 2005: Cecilia McDowall\nand John McCabe\nThe Presteigne Festival of Music and the Arts con-\ntinues to enchant and enrich. Events in August\n2005 embraced a broad survey of English music,\nincluding centenary tributes to Tippett and\nRawsthorne, as well as world premi\u00e8res by John\nMcCabe, Cecilia McDowall, David Matthews and\ncomposer-in residence Ian Wilson. Informal talks\nwere particularly compelling, including a sympo-\nsium consisting of Sally Groves, David Matthews\nand Geraint Lewis offering affectionate and\ninsightful reminiscences of Michael Tippett and a\ndetailed and uniquely authoritative appraisal of\nthe music of Alan Rawsthorne by his biographer,\nJohn McCabe.\nAmong the many admirable qualities of this\nannual feast is its fearlessness in programming\nnon-mainstream late 20th- and early 21st-century\nworks, none of them world premi\u00e8res, thus tak-\ning audiences into unfamiliar territory without\nthe critic-luring prestige of a first performance.\nThanks to the unfailingly acute ear of Artistic\nDirector George Vass for pieces uniting impecca-\nble quality with engaging accessibility, the results\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nacceptance of the transience of all things. McCabe\nenhanced his texts with a limpet-like fidelity to the\ntone of the words whilst capturing and sketching\nthe moods they provoked with a painterly \nsensibility. \nCecilia McDowall\u2019s Radnor Songs set six poems\nby Simon Mundy. The composer\u2019s genuine gift for\nilluminating and embellishing texts was instantly\nin evidence. \u2018The Buzzard\u2019, which opened the\ncycle, used liberating, outspread intervals to illus-\ntrate the awesome, swooping bird. The brooklet\nin \u2018Summergil\u2019, which \u2018ingratiates the birds\u2019, was\nlaced with filigree ornithological ornamentation,\nwhilst the final, spacious setting of \u2018Radnor (Old),\nChurch and Harp\u2019 created a movingly nostalgic,\nbut valiantly unsentimental evocation of the\narea\u2019s lost glories. Unostentatious and refined,\nMcDowall\u2019s vocal lines and accompaniments\nwere alert to the meaning and nuance of the\npoems, so that musical ideas grew naturally from\nthem. \u2018Radnor Songs\u2019 was a model of how to give\ninsight into words through music, as opposed to\nparaphrasing or merely adorning them. \nIn a very welcome touch, the poems were read\nby their respective authors as an introduction to\nthe settings; soprano Rachel Nicholls, despite a\nvirus affliction, gave persuasive, authentic and\ncommanding performances of both song-cycles.\nThese two new Presteigne Festival commissions\ncomplemented each other well, making a signifi-\ncant addition to the repertoire. Though they have\nmuch to offer anyone who has yet to set foot in the\nWelsh border country, for those who know the\narea, its mysteriously melancholic atmosphere\nand blood-soaked history are triumphantly cap-\ntured. More courageously, the settings do not\nshirk from laying bare the challenges of present-\nday life in a scene \u2018ravaged by tranquillity\u2019 as\nSimon Mundy so memorably puts it in the final,\nfading moments of Radnor Songs. \nPaul Conway\nBirmingham: John Joubert\u2019s \u2018Jane Eyre\u2019\nJane Eyre is by no means John Joubert\u2019s first foray\ninto opera. Both Silas Marner (1961) and Under\nWestern Eyes (1968) are forceful, impressive three-\nact stage works which underline Joubert\u2019s gift for\nworking on a large canvas; the prelude to those\nwas In the Drought, a substantial one-acter dating\nfrom the mid-1950s, which reveals a comparable\npower. One regrets that Joubert, being South\nAfrican-born, has not been able to turn his hand to\nthe opera based on Alan Paton which remains a\nproject close to his heart.\nIn the meantime we have Jane Eyre, composed\nsome years ago, largely in the 1990s, although not\nto commission. Hence it has had to wait for a pre-\nmi\u00e8re, and one can only be grateful that Opera\nMint, a company mixing professionals and ama-\nteurs, had the nerve to take the bull by the horns\nand volunteer a staging at the CBSO Centre in\nBirmingham (23 and 25 September). \nSome caveats are necessary. This was a modest,\neven embryonic staging, although not without\nideas, including some effective use of back-projec-\ntions by designer Saranjit Birdi and a striking use\nof dance and coloured light effects, notably for the\nfire which, at the close of Act I, serves as a warning\nof worse to come. Moves were clearish; otherwise\nstage direction seemed slightly sporadic. Most\nimportantly, the orchestra \u2013 Joubert stipulates sin-\ngle wind and brass \u2013 effectively disappeared. This\nwas done in a version for string quartet and piano. \nIn the circumstances, it was remarkable how\nwell the opera fared. The skill of librettist\nKenneth Birkin in paring down Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s\nnovel (which has also been turned into an opera by\nMichael Berkeley, staged by Music Theatre Wales)\nemerged clearly. Act II encompasses perhaps the\ntwo most important scenes \u2013 the burgeoning of\nlove between Jane and Mr.Rochester and the disas-\ntrous wedding \u2013 while Act I (the departure from\nLowood and arrival at Thornfield Hall) serves as a\ntension-filled prelude and the final Act (including\nJane\u2019s welcoming into the home of the would-be\nmissionary St. John Rivers and her flight from him\nback to the blinded Rochester) functions as an\neffective epilogue.\nJoubert fills his first Act with nervy, jagged\nrhythms and stabbing patterns which evoke, and\nwith varying success maintain, a laden atmos-\nphere not unlike that of The Turn of the Screw \u2013\nBritten, from Peter Grimes onwards, remains one of\nJoubert\u2019s most recurrent influences; indeed, he\nwas perhaps one of the earliest composers to soak\nin and capitalize upon Britten\u2019s example. More\nthan once one sensed Miles, the Governess and\neven Quint (notably the eerie passage when Mrs.\nGrose describes his icy demise) hovering in the\nwings. \nThe four young string players made a magnifi-\ncent job of the score, with Dane Preece\u2019s piano\nfilling in quite graphic independent parts and the\npace \u2013 essential here \u2013 ably maintained by conduc-\ntor Emyr Roberts.

In\nrecent years this biennial July festival has show-\ncased major contemporary composers, for\ninstance commissioning in 1997 Giles Swayne\u2019s\nChinese Whispers which the composer himself\ndescribed in his pre-concert talk as an argument\nbetween organ and orchestra driven to a climax\nwhere the organist (Kevin Bowyer) was required\n\u2018to run amok\u2019 \u2013 which he duly did, being required\nat one point, I seem to remember, to almost throw\nhimself bodily onto the keyboard in a dramatic\ngesture. As I described in my review for the St\nAlbans Observer \u2018we got a first movement which\nsounded like measured spurts of mathematically\nstructured chaos\u2019. On the final festive concert of\nIOF 2001, we were treated to the UK premi\u00e8re of\nPiet Kee\u2019s The World with the BBC Singers under\nNicholas Cleobury.\nThe 2005 Festival had no new specifically IOF\ncommission, but the traditional Three Choirs\nConcert on 11 July saw Winchester Cathedral\nChoristers give a most invigorating performance\nof their new commission from James MacMillan,\nLaudi alla beata vergine, which they had premiered\nto mark Advent 2004, at Winchester Cathedral.\nBased on the poem by Dante Alighieri, this is a\npowerful piece. Its rousing opening is followed by\nalternating strong outbursts and quiet interludes,\nand one can discern possible shades of Eastern\ninfluence in the harmonies later on, with use of\nbackground hummimg, \u2018slides\u2019 and delicate glis-\nsandi to atmospheric effect.\nHowever most innovative of all at this year\u2019s\nThree Choirs Concert was the performance by St\nAlbans Cathedral\u2019s Assistant Master of Music,\nSimon Johnson, of Jonathan Harvey\u2019s Toccata for\nOrgan and Tape (1980) \u2013 apparently the compos-\ner\u2019s only work for organ. \u2018I wanted to play\nsomething exciting as an organ solo and this was\nso \u201cdifferent\u201d\u2019, said Simon when I asked him about\nthis intriguing piece after the concert. In the pro-\ngramme notes he described this very unusual\nscore, where usual metre is abandoned in favour\nof strict timings in seconds, as a piece \u2018driven by\nperpetual motion in both organ and tape parts\u2019. It\ndates from early 1980s, which Johnson describes as\na very productive time for Harvey, when he was\ninvited by Pierre Boulez to work at IRCAM.in\nParis. (He also produced his well-known tape\npiece Mortuos plango vivos voco, influenced by the\nsounds of \u2018Musique concrete\u2019, in the same year.)\nAs rendered by Johnson at IOF, Harvey\u2019s Toccata\nfor organ and tape came across as a stunningly\nintrepid perpetual motion piece, strictly metro-\nnomic, with the organist performing the\nmarathon task of fitting in his intricate organ part\nagainst the unforgiving relentless \u2018plopping\u2019 of\nthe electronic tape that he has to respond to and\nsynchronize with. The ongoing tape, relayed\nthrough a PA system in the organ loft, \u2018takes no\nprisoners\u2019 in its wake. Johnson rose to the chal-\nlenge with amazing skill and energy, amidst the\nfinal build-up with its accelerando, full organ out-\nbursts, shuddering sound effects, and glissandi.\nJill Barlow\nShrewsbury, Maidment Hall: Hugh Wood\u2019s\nOverture op. 48.\nAlthough the Lindsay Quartet retired in July 2005,\ntheir former leader Peter Cropper shows little sign\nof slowing down. To his many ongoing activities,\nwe must now add the piano trio he has formed\nwith long-time associates Martin Roscoe and\nMoray Welsh. To mark the first performance of\nthis ensemble, Cropper commissioned a short\noverture from Hugh Wood, which was premi\u00e8red\non 29 September alongside trios by Beethoven and\nSchubert. \nAs its no-nonsense title suggests, Wood\u2019s\nresponse to the commission was to provide a\nstraightforward concert opener: its cheerful verve\nreminiscent of Classical overtures. It opens with a\nseries of fanfare-like gestures in the strings, punc-\ntuated by sonorous chords and driving\nsemiquaver figuration from the piano. This swift-\nly gives way to a lyrical duet between violin and\ncello, the piano now supplying the accompani-\nment. An extended middle section begins with\njust violin and cello, and ends with piano alone.\nThe fanfares return twice more, at first spectrally,\nto announce the start of an altered recapitulation,\nand then again at the outset of a vigorous coda.\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 77\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nThe juxtaposition of fanfares and lyricism\nforms a characteristic means of generating con-\ntrast in Wood\u2019s music, and is handled in the\noverture with typical regard for dramatic pacing.\nFamiliar, too, is the use of three tetrachords that,\nin various combinations, permutations and verti-\ncal arrangements, underpin much of the musical\ndevelopment. Two of these tetrachords are\nformed from segments of the whole-tone scales\nstarting respectively on G and B\u0002; the third is their\ncomplement. The emphasis on whole tones\ncolours the harmonic and melodic content of the\noverture, even in the more overtly chromatic pas-\nsages. This in turn contributes to the general\natmosphere of the work, which must count\namongst Wood\u2019s most light-hearted pieces.\nBoth Peter Cropper and Moray Welsh are expe-\nrienced interpreters of Wood\u2019s music: the Lindsay\nQuartet premi\u00e8red Wood\u2019s Third and Fifth quar-\ntets, and Welsh\u2019s wonderful 1978 recording of\nWood\u2019s Cello Concerto has been re-issued recent-\nly by NMC. The resulting familiarity with Wood\u2019s\nstyle undoubtedly informed the excellent per-\nformance of the overture, which began with a\nriskily fast but exhilarating tempo, and rarely let\nup after that. The only drawback was that the\npiano accompaniment to the lyrical passages was\nnot given enough time to resonate, sounding\nrather heavy against the soaring strings; indeed, in\nthe resonant Maidment Hall, the piano too often\nobscured the other instruments. However, the\nnine further scheduled performances of the work,\nas part of the Music in the Round \u2018Around the\nCountry\u2019 tour\u2019, should see such problems of bal-\nance ironed out. Given the distinguished\nperformances of the Beethoven and Schubert that\nfollowed Wood\u2019s overture, one cannot imagine\nthat it would be otherwise. \nEdward Venn \nLondon, Royal Albert Hall \u2013 Wynton\nMarsalis\u2019s \u2018All Rise\u2019\nThe idea of a synthesis of classical music and jazz is\nnearly as old as jazz itself \u2013 from the era of\nGershwin and Stravinsky through Bernstein,\nBrubeck or Jacques Loussier.

The eclectic mix of dif-\nferent styles and genres is centred on the Blues.\nOriginally commissioned by the New York\nPhilharmonic in 1999 and recorded by the Los\nAngeles Philharmonic in 2002, the work was per-\nformed here on 2 October by the Lincoln Centre\nJazz Orchestra with the London Philharmonic and\nthe London Adventis Chorale under the command\nof Kurt Masur, at a capacity-filled Albert Hall, the\nthird leg in a five-concert UK premiere tour (fol-\nlowing performances in Birmingham and Cardiff ). \nThe piece, according to the composer, \u2018cele-\nbrates togetherness and ascendence in the context\nof the blues\u2019 and twelve movements (based on the\nidea of a 12-bar Blues) show how the freedom of\njazz can be combined with the traditions of con-\ncert music, sectioned into three contrasting\ngroups in a traditional fast-slow-fast arrangement.\nThe final choral movement, entitled \u2018All Rise\u2019,\nsums up the theme of the entire piece, which\naddresses the \u2018global community\u2019 through the\nBlues which Marsalis sees as containing elements\nof folk music from all over the world and express-\ning the philosophy of \u2018acceptance of life\u2019. This is\nperhaps questionable, since one might want to\nconsider the Blues as an expression of a state of\naffairs inviting one to rise up against injustice and\noppression. Yet the simple three-part form\nallowed us to focus on the really innovative aspect\nof the work, the inspired mixture of popular\nidioms, eastern scales and classical elements,\nembodying the idea of \u2018togetherness\u2019, a combina-\ntion of disparate styles and peoples, not, as\nMarsalis says \u2018in a world-music type of melange\u2019\nbut keeping them distinct, and yet emphasizing,\nthrough a myriad variations of Blues, traces of\ntheir commonality.\nAt a formal level the work displays some of the\nfeatures of the Baroque era, combining elements\nof the oratorio, orchestral suite and, most strik-\ningly, the concerto grosso, in which the virtuoso\nconcertino \u2013 the LCJO \u2013 is pitted in dialogue and\ncombination with the larger symphony orchestra,\nwith ingenious dovetailings of brass or wood-\nwind. It is a very American work, one in which the\njoyful brilliance of the LCJO\u2019s many jazz idioms\ninteracts with the orchestra, both as a classical and\njazz medium. For example in the initial four-\nmovement section, the thrusting, driving patterns\nof the music were infused with great energy and\nrich harmony, as in the overture \u2018Jubal Step\u2019. One\nmovement begins with Mahlerian waltz, while\n\u2018Wild Strumming of Fiddle\u2019 is a Coplandesque\n\u2018hoe-down\u2019 leading to a fizzing fugato reminiscent\nof Ned Rorem. Many of the textures recall\nLeonard Bernstein\u2019s swinging syntheses and big\nbands of the 1940s and 50s; the orchestra often\ncomments on and dovetails into the jazz soloists\nwho then go off on their own; at one point the\norchestra is also a brilliant big band in itself.\nThere were many highlights to this exuberant\nperformance, in which the always lucid Masur\nseemed to be gradually skipping more and more\nto the LCJO\u2019s beat and riff, and the audience\u2019s\nresponse to each new jazz solo sandwiched\nbetween orchestral textures increased in warmth.\nMost impressive was Marsalis\u2019s own solo, in \u2018Save\nUs\u2019, sharing his inimitable trumpet playing. He\nmakes the instrument sound almost vocal, high in\nits register, swoops and glissandos and pure-toned\nhigh notes, shaped into a dreamy world of its own;\nand his always audible interjections into the lively\ntutti-choral movements added vital spice. There\nwere several other notable solos, one for trom-\nbone ending on an incredibly pure high note,\nvarious sax solos and a witty duet for principal\norchestral violin and principal cellist, accompa-\nnied by piano and bass. The piano solo was a\nfantastic display of musicianship, sophisticated\nand subtle in its blues harmony and extended\nphrases, while final limelight was reserved for the\nsuperb drummer: throughout, he was a fine part-\nner to the team of percussionists of the London\nPhilharmonic who visibly enjoyed their syncopat-\ned colours on various instruments including\nguiro, slapsticks and cymbals.\nThe singing of the London Adventist Chorale\nwas rivetting, gradually increasing in presence\nfrom a short introductory movement to the\nsolemn movements of the second main group. In\n\u2018Save us\u2019, a Sprechgesang alto soloist shouts\n\u2018Comfort me\u2019 against a wall of groaning, slither-\ning chromatically in dizzy curves, creating\nhaunting colours enhanced by Marsalis\u2019s solo; it is\nfollowed by the fiercer \u2018Cried Shouted Then\nSung\u2019, with screaming trumpet solos. Here\nMarsalis\u2019s use of the \u2018New Orleans Funeral\nCadence\u2019 (an almost prophetic choice in the wake\nof the devastation of Hurricane Katrina) added to\nthe \u2018affect\u2019 of the music, which was also punctuat-\ned by unusual tuba solos, while the choir shone in\nthe final brilliant pair of movements to close this\nsection: \u2018Look Beyond\u2019, with its upbeat Hosannas\nand a spiritual, \u2018Come back home\u2019, in which five\nsoloists of the choir displayed wonderful zest and\nstyle, the last an unbelievably high soprano solo\n( Jennifer Phillips). The inner intensity of this\nmovement drew to a conclusion with spiritual pas-\nsion and eloquence that affirmed the work\u2019s\nunderlying seriousness of purpose. Indeed the\nwhole work, with its unpredictable phrase-lengths\nand effects, rich and unusual harmonies, nuances\nof orchestration and dynamics, seemed to channel\n\uf766\uf769\uf772\uf773\uf774 \uf770\uf765\uf772\uf766\uf76f\uf772\uf76d\uf761\uf76e\uf763\uf765\uf773 79\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nthe qualities of light musicality into a most engag-\ning and profound artistic confluence of serious\nand popular idioms.\nThe third and final section (which followed\nafter an interval) featured dance movements,\nincluding a slinky slow \u2018Saturday Night Slow\nDrag\u2019 and faster dances like the bossa nova, before\nthe thrilling final tutti chorus \u2018All Rise\u2019. This move-\nment begins with a soloist repeating \u2018all rise\u2019; the\nensuing lively choral textures lead to an uplifting\ngospel song, \u2018Listen up and hear my song\u2019, to\nwhich the jazz orchestra adds a final coda in\nDixieland swing \u2013 a section that was repeated as\nencore after enthusiastic applause from the audi-\nence. As an additional treat Kurt Masur remained\non stage for a beautiful jazz number by the LCJO,\nled by a beguiling Marsalis solo. Evocatively sil-\nhouetted in profile, as artist and instrument\nseemed for an extended moment to fuse into a sin-\ngle entity, he coaxed some husky, blues-inflected\ntunings at pianissimo levels. \nMalcolm Miller\nLondon, Royal College of Music: Ad\u00e8s and\nHesketh London premi\u00e8res\nTo go by the relative public profiles of Thomas\nAd\u00e8s\u2019s Violin Concerto and Court Studies, given\ntheir London premi\u00e8res within a fortnight of one\nanother, then the latter must count as a minor\nwork within his output. If this is true, then what\nbetter sign of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s international standing can\nthere be for a \u2018minor\u2019 work to receive three per-\nformances by different ensembles within the\nspace of just over three months? Following the\nfirst performance at the Aldeburgh Festival on 16\nJune by the Composers Ensemble, the US pre-\nmi\u00e8re was given at the Charlottesville Chamber\nMusic Festival on 15 September. Four days later,\nthe Contemporary Consort became the third\ngroup to take the work into their repertory, in the\npiece\u2019s first London performance.\nWritten for clarinet, violin, cello and piano\nCourt Studies is the first of two works to be based\non Ad\u00e8s\u2019s 2004 opera The Tempest;2 it also happens\nto use the same forces as his Catch, op. 4 of 1991.3\n(The second work, Scenes from The Tempest, is to be\ngiven its premi\u00e8re by the Los Angeles PO in 2006.)\nThe Court Studies belong to the tradition of Ad\u00e8s\u2019s\nearlier arrangements for the Composers\nEnsemble, Les baricades Mist\u00e9rieuses and Cardiac\nArrest: they are not, therefore, commentaries or\nre-workings of themes from the opera. All four\ninstruments are asked to play more or less contin-\nuously; nevertheless, they frequently find\nthemselves contributing only a fragment of a line\nbefore leaping to complete another figure initiat-\ned in a different instrument. In particular, the\nvocal lines are cleverly dissolved into the texture to\nthe extent that their presence can be distantly felt,\nghost-like, only occasionally coming to the surface. \nAs its title suggests, Court Studies consists of a\nseries of character sketches of members of the\nNeapolitan court from the opera. These sketches\nare largely drawn from Act 2 Scene 1, in which the\nvarious characters are introduced in turn; there\nare also sections drawn from Act 2 Scene 2, and\nAct 3 Scene 4. I was unconvinced of the merits of\nall the selected material: for example, against the\ncaptivating final section, \u2018The King\u2019s Grief \u2019, the\npreceding \u2018The Counsellor\u2019 seemed merely prosa-\nic. A persistent melodic motif notwithstanding, it\nwas hard on one hearing to make sense of how the\nbrief and contrasting character pieces combined\nto make a satisfactory whole; however, there was\nplenty in this performance to suggest that repeat-\ned hearings would be worthwhile.\nThe concert opened with world premi\u00e8res of\nworks by two of the RCM\u2019s current students. The\nfirst, Far Secco Qualcuno by Jonathan Herbert,\nexplored the increasing interaction between con-\ntrasting ideas: one sustained, fluid, and delicate,\nand the other percussive, brittle, and loud. The\nsharply defined character of the material at the\noutset occasionally gave way to more neutral\nmaterial in the latter stages; nevertheless Herbert\ndemonstrated a keen aural imagination and sensi-\ntive feel for pacing. Dominic Sewell\u2019s Esoteria for\nstring trio and clarinet was less ambitious in its\naims, and more focussed as a result. Conceived as a\n\u2018tonally based response to a 12-note row of pitch-\nes\u2019, the work consists of an extended commentary\non a theme first announced by the clarinet, inter-\nspersed with cadenzas for each instrument. To say\nthat the harmonic language and manner of the-\nmatic development was traditional is no bad\nthing; this was well-composed and sincere music. \nThe technical wing of the Contemporary\nConsort is entrusted to Michael Oliva, who diffused\nthe electronic part of his restrained Apparition and\nRelease for quarter tone alto flute and electronics.\nThe latter provided a generally understated back-\nground to the meditative lyricism of the flute, often\ntaking the form of pulsed, hypnotic chords; only\noccasionally did it threaten to overwhelm the solo\nline in the more energetic climaxes.\nThe final work of the concert was Kenneth\nHesketh\u2019s Threats and Declamations, another\nLondon premi\u00e8re. The title refers to the novel for-\n2 The Tempest was reviewed in Tempo 59 (229), pp. 72\u20133.\n3 In its US premi\u00e8re, Court Studies was programmed alongside\nCatch.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f80\nhttp:\/\/journals.cambridge.org Downloaded: 07 Dec 2010 IP address: 194.80.32.10\nmal and narrative structures employed in the\nmusic, which are guided by the old English expres-\nsions Commination and Patriment (or joc-partit).\nThe first of these expressions means \u2018threat\u2019 (it is\nalso a church service held during Lent); the second\nis a poetic form of the Proven\u00e7al troubadours, in\nwhich two verbal antagonists trade themes. This\nexchange happens three times before an arbiter\ndeclares a winner. Within Threats and Declamations,\nthe structure of the joc-partit is most clearly audi-\nble in the second half of the work; two contrasting\nideas (one improvisatory, one regular) alternate\nthree times, the first functioning rondo-like, the\nsecond varied on each appearance. At the climax\nof the work, the two occur simultaneously, before\na theme from the first section returns to close the\npiece.

I\nhad caught up with Sadie just before she flew off to\nLithuania (winter 2004\u20135) to make some record-\nings.

It is due to\nappear on the Metier label during 2006,4 as will her\nLithuanian-based string quartet Geda\u2019s Weavings,\nall much influenced by the violinist Rusne\nMataityte.\nBut what of Sadie Harrison\u2019s compositional\napproach stylistically? Strangely enough I found\nher \u2018Taking Flight\u2019(the Metier CD of that title,\nMSV CD92053, released in 2000) particularly\nstrong in impact, revealing distinct shades of a\n\u2018Birtwistle trying to get out\u2019. When I asked Sadie\nabout this she replied: \u2018well, one can\u2019t be a com-\nposer in isolation, one is influenced by other\ncomposers, and Harrison Birtwistle consented to\nbe patron of our local Semle Festival which I\ndirect.

Indeed I can\u2019t help but\nfeel perhaps critic Andy Hamilton (The Wire) best\nsums up her style when he puts her as a composer\nin the \u2018category of what could be described as\n\u201cdomesticated modernism\u201d \u2013 tonal composers\nwho are aware of modernist gestures while (also)\naware of the danger of audience alienation\u2019.

Personally I\nwould say I find Sadie Harrison\u2019s works abrasively\ncompelling, imbued with sheer emotional energy\nand impact. So if there is a \u2018Birtwistle\u2019 (and cer-\ntainly a \u2018Harrison\u2019) trying to take full flight, by\nthrowing caution to the wind, this composer\ncould have a truly radical future ahead.\nJill Barlow\n4 see < www.metierrecords.co.uk>.\n\uf774\uf765\uf76d\uf770\uf76f82\n"}
