We obtain accurate radial velocities for 42 globular clusters (GCs) in total, 30 for GCs around the elliptical\nNGC 3379, eight around the lenticular NGC 3384, and four which may be associated with either galaxy. These data are notable for their large\nradial range extending from 0.\u20327 to 14.\u20325 (2 to 42 kpc) from the centre of NGC 3379, and small velocity uncertainties of about 10 km s\u22121. We\ncombine our sample of 30 radial velocities for globular clusters around NGC 3379 with 8 additional GC velocities from the literature, and\nfind a projected velocity dispersion of \u03c3p = 175+24\u221222 km s\u22121 at R < 5\u2032 and \u03c3p = 147+44\u221239 at R > 5\u2032.

Such a model is also consistent with the stellar velocity dispersion at small radii and the rotation of the H i ring at large radii, and\nhas a (M\/L)B that increases by a factor of five from several kpc to 100 kpc.

Introduction\nThe current paradigm for galaxy formation is that galaxies form\nfrom baryons that cool within dark matter halos. This paradigm\nis supported by the abundant observational evidence for dark\nmatter in the Universe on many scales, ranging from clusters\nof galaxies to the halos of individual spiral and dwarf galaxies.\nIdeally, one would like to test for the presence of dark matter\nhalos around early-type galaxies as well, and to study the prop-\nerties of these halos.\n\u0002 Based on observations collected at the very large telescope (VLT),\nEuropean Southern Observatory, Chile, under programme 71.B\u20130537.\n\u0002\u0002 Tables A.1\u2013A.3 are only available in electronic form at the CDS\nvia anonymous ftp to\ncdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via\nhttp:\/\/cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr\/cgi-bin\/qcat?J\/A+A\/448\/155\nDetermining the halo masses and mass profiles of individ-\nual elliptical galaxies has proven to be challenging, primar-\nily because they lack a readily observed dynamical tracer at\nlarge radii like the H i gas of spiral galaxies. Dedicated spectro-\nscopic studies of the integrated light have been limited to about\nR \u0001 2Re (e.g., Kronawitter et al. 2000). For the most lumi-\nnous and massive ellipticals, X-ray observations of the hot gas\naround these galaxies provide evidence for dark matter (e.g.\nLoewenstein & White 1999). Studies of gravitational lensing\nalso indicate the presence of dark matter halos around ellip-\ntical galaxies. Specifically, individual cases of strong lensing\n(e.g., Treu & Koopmans 2004) show evidence for dark mat-\nter at modest radii, while analyses of weak lensing (Wilson\net al. 2001; McKay et al. 2001; Hoekstra et al. 2004) provide\nstrong statistical evidence for dark matter halos at large radii\naround early-type galaxies. Similar results for dark matter at\nArticle published by EDP Sciences and available at http:\/\/www.edpsciences.org\/aa or http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1051\/0004-6361:20053697\n156 G. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group\nlarge-scales around elliptical galaxies are provided by studies\nof satellite galaxies in large surveys (Prada et al. 2003; Brainerd\n2004). However, for ordinary elliptical galaxies, a substantial\nrange of profiles from inner to outer regions is allowed, and\nthe dependence of halo properties on galaxy luminosity is not\nstrongly constrained. Therefore, determining the masses and\nmass profiles of ordinary individual elliptical galaxies is of sig-\nnificant interest.\nThe radial velocities of globular clusters (GCs) and plane-\ntary nebulae around elliptical galaxies provide a powerful way\nto probe the dynamics of their host galaxy. The extended spa-\ntial distribution of GC systems makes them particularly useful\nprobes of any dark matter halos around elliptical galaxies. The\nvalue of these probes has been demonstrated by the clear evi-\ndence for dark matter halos found by studies of the radial ve-\nlocities of GCs around the elliptical galaxies NGC 4472 (e.g.\nZepf et al. 2000; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2003), NGC 4486 (e.g., Cohen\n2000; Romanowsky & Kochanek 2001), NGC 1399 (Richtler\net al. 2004), and NGC 5128 (Peng et al. 2004). However, there\nare only four galaxies with such high quality data, and with the\nexception of NGC 5128, all are considerably more luminous\nthan a typical elliptical galaxy.\nSpectroscopic studies of the planetary nebulae (PNe) can\nalso probe the dynamics of elliptical galaxies. Romanowsky\net al. (2003), hereafter R03, specifically carried out a study of\nthe radial velocities of PNe around three elliptical galaxies of\nmoderate luminosity. They found that the galaxy with the most\ndata, NGC 3379, required little dark matter to the radial limit of\ntheir sample at 9 kpc (3\u2032). The other two ellipticals, NGC 821\nand NGC 4494 also appeared similar, but with weaker con-\nstraints. NGC 3379 (\u2261M105) is in many ways the archetypal\nordinary elliptical galaxy, as it is the nearest \u201cnormal\u201d giant el-\nliptical galaxy, with a distance of 10 Mpc (Jensen et al. 2003;\nsee also Gregg et al. 2004) in the Leo I group, and an inter-\nmediate luminosity of LB = 1.42 \u00d7 1010 L\u0004 (MB = \u221219.9).\nTherefore, the possibility that its dark matter halo might not be\nas expected is critical to follow up.\nIn this paper, we present the results of a study of the dy-\nnamics of the GC system around NGC 3379. Studying the\nGC system has two important advantages for understanding\nthe halo dynamics of NGC 3379 beyond the obvious utility of\nproviding an independent test of the PNe results. Firstly, there\nhas long been discussion in the literature about the possibility\nthat NGC 3379 has a significantly flattened component viewed\nface-on (Capaccioli et al. 1991). Subsequent papers have come\nto mixed conclusions about the presence of such a compo-\nnent (e.g., Statler 1994; Statler & Smecker-Hane 1999; Statler\n2001), but it is obviously an important consideration for inter-\npreting the radial velocities of objects observed in NGC 3379.\nHere, GCs provide a key advantage, because they are less likely\nthan other tracer populations such as PNe to have significant\ncontribution from a strong disc component. The second advan-\ntage of GCs is that candidate GCs can be identified in wide-\nfield imaging of nearby ellipticals out to very large radii (e.g.\nRhode & Zepf 2001, 2004 \u2013 hereafter RZ04; Harris et al. 2004).\nThis large area over which GCs are observed allows the kine-\nmatics of the halo to be probed over a very large radial range.\nThe plan of the paper is that the spectroscopic observations\nand the determination of the radial velocities are presented in\nSect. 2. The properties of the GC systems of the Leo I group\ngalaxies NGC 3379 and NGC 3384 are discussed in Sect. 3. In\nSect. 4, we present the dynamical analysis of the NGC 3379\nGC system and the implications for the dark matter halo of this\ngalaxy. The conclusions are given in Sect. 5.\n2. Observations and data analysis\n2.1. Identification of globular cluster candidates\nand MEDUSA fibre allocation\nThe advent of large format images with mosaiced arrays of\nCCDs on 4-m class telescopes allows for the identification of\ncandidate GCs over a wide field around galaxies in the lo-\ncal universe. In particular, RZ04 carried out a multi-colour\nimaging study of the GC systems of nearby elliptical galax-\nies utilising the MOSAIC camera on the Mayall 4 m telescope.\nThey identified GC candidates as unresolved objects withBVR\ncolours consistent with those of Galactic GCs, taking into ac-\ncount the photometric uncertainties (see RZ04 for more de-\ntails). In order to obtain sufficient S\/N spectra in a <\u223c 4-h ex-\nposure, we selected candidates brighter than V \u2264 22. To help\nminimise contamination from non-GCs, we also placed a bright\nlimit on the sample of V \u2265 19, which affects only the extremely\nhigh luminosity tail of the GC population at MV <\u223c \u221211. Over\nthe 37\u2032 \u00d7 37\u2032 MOSAIC field centered on NGC 3379, 196 can-\ndidate GCs met these criteria for our spectroscopic follow-up.\nWe used FLAMES, the multi-object, wide-field fibre spec-\ntrograph of VLT\/UT2 (see Pasquini et al. 2004) to efficiently\nobtain spectra of a significant sample of these GCs. The\nGIRAFFE\/MEDUSA mode of this instrument offers 130 fi-\nbres over a 25\u2032 diameter field of view, making it an excel-\nlent match to the wide-field MOSAIC images (see Fig. 1) and\nthe extended spatial distribution of the globular cluster sys-\ntems of nearby elliptical galaxies. We ran the FPOSS soft-\nware to allocate the 130 available fibres to 108 GC candidates,\ntwelve sky positions, and ten V \u223c 18 stars to be used as tem-\nplates for radial velocity determinations, in a field centered at\n(\u03b1, \u03b4)J2000.0 = (10h48m01s, 12\u25e633\u203230\u2032\u2032).\n2.2. Observations and radial velocity determination\nThe FLAMES observations were carried out in service mode\non VLT\/UT2 (Kueyen), with the GIRAFFE\/MEDUSA config-\nuration. We chose to use the grating LR4 which has a resolv-\ning power of \u03bb\/\u2206(\u03bb) \u223c 6000, and a central wavelength of\n\u03bbc = 5431 \u00c5 that covers many absorption features over 800 \u00c5\n(including strong Mg and Fe lines), and sufficient efficiency to\nprovide useful spectra (S\/N \u2265 5 per pixel) of V <\u223c 22 unre-\nsolved sources in 3\u20134 h. Our observing programme consisted\nof five 2595-s exposures taken on separate nights, in May\u2013\nJune 2003, under good seeing (\u223c0.\u2032\u20327) conditions.\nAfter standard reductions to extract the spectra with the\nIRAF hydra package, we determined the radial velocities \u0001\nof the objects by cross-correlating their spectrum with stel-\nlar templates. The cross-correlation function (CCF) peak was\nG. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group 157\nFig. 1. V-band MOSAIC image of the Leo I group. The image covers\n37\u2032 \u00d7 37\u2032 and is plotted with north up and east to the left. The large\ncircle shows the FLAMES 25\u2032 diameter field of view, corresponding\nto 75 kpc at the distance of NGC 3379. The objects are noted with\nvarious symbols according to their FLAMES radial velocities \u0001 as fol-\nlows: squares represent GCs (500 < \u0001 < 1300 km s\u22121) with larger\nsquares indicating a more certain radial velocity, crosses represent ob-\njects identified as stars (\u0001 < 350 km s\u22121) with the size of the symbol\ncorresponding to the confidence in the velocity as above, and triangles\nshow the 21 objects without a clear cross-correlation peak including\nobjects with insufficient S\/N and background emission-line galaxies.\nfitted by the IRAF\/rv task fxcor to estimate the velocity rel-\native to the template, with a typical accuracy of 5\u201315 km s\u22121\n(each pixel represents 0.2 \u00c5 or 11 km s\u22121 with the LR4 grat-\ning).\nThe cross-correlation was first done using the ten V \u223c\n18 red stars to which we allocated fibres so as to provide\nstellar templates for radial velocity determination. To supple-\nment these \u201csimultaneous\u201d templates, we used 100 F5\u2013K2 high\nsignal-to-noise spectra \u2013 both (sub)dwarfs and giants \u2013 ex-\ntracted from the \u00c9LODIE archive1 (Moultaka et al. 2004). The\nLL_ELODIE stellar library is well-suited for GIRAFFE, with a\nvery similar dispersion (the scale is also of 0.2 \u00c5\/pixel, iden-\ntical to the LR4 grating) which implies minimal rebinning of\nboth spectra.\nThe CCF peak Gaussian fits to all of the templates were\nchecked both by determining the RCCF -value of the fit as de-\nfined by Tonry & Davis (1979), and additionally by eye. These\nagreed well, and the velocities obtained for a dozen of the\nbrightest targets were compared between individual exposure\nspectra, and also showed good agreement to within the errors\nestimated by fxcor. We then adopted the following classifica-\ntion of the quality of FLAMES radial velocity determinations:\n\u2013 class A: more than 98% of \u00c9LODIE and more than five (out\nof ten) simultaneous templates agree within the errors \u03b4\u0001;\n1 http:\/\/atlas.obs-hp.fr\/elodie\nFig. 2. A histogram of the FLAMES radial velocities for all class A\n(34 GCs and 32 stars) and class B (8 GCs and 4 stars) objects. This\nhistogram shows a clear \u223c200 km s\u22121 gap between the highest velocity\nstars and the lowest velocity clusters (associated with NGC 3384).\n\u2013 class B: more than 80% of \u00c9LODIE and \u22653 simultaneous\ntemplates agree within the estimated errors;\n\u2013 class C (not used): less than 60% of \u00c9LODIE and only 0\u20132\nsimultaneous templates agree.\nFor one object, gc771, we clearly detected [O iii] \u03bb 5007 at a\nradial velocity of 766 km s\u22121. This both provides interesting\nevidence for a planetary nebula in an extragalactic GC, suggest-\ning these may not be exceedingly rare (see Minniti & Rejkuba\n2002, for another example), and also confirmation of the best\nestimate for the radial velocity from the cross-correlation of\nthe absorption lines. For all subsequent work, we consider the\nobjects with class A and B radial velocities, and defer consid-\neration of the class C objects until further data are obtained.\nThe reliability and accuracy of our radial velocities are\nstrongly supported by a comparison with the data of Puzia et al.\n(2004, hereafter P04) who used the FORS instrument on the\nVLT to obtain radial velocities for 18 NGC 3379 inner GCs.\nTen of the clusters in the P04 dataset are in our sample, in-\ncluding nine of our class A objects and one class B cluster.\nThe agreement between the two studies is excellent with an\naverage difference of 1 km s\u22121 and a dispersion of 30 km s\u22121.\nSince 30 km s\u22121 is close to the typical uncertainty in the lower\nspectral resolution P04 data, this comparison is consistent with\nthe small uncertainties we find for our velocities of only about\n10 km s\u22121 in most cases.\n2.3. Separation of globular clusters and stars\nThe histogram of measured radial velocities for the objects\nwe observed is shown in Fig. 2. The heliocentric velocities\nof NGC 3379 and NGC 3384 are 904 km s\u22121 and 721 km s\u22121\nrespectively (Falco et al. 1999; Smith et al. 2000) and the galax-\nies are expected to have modest velocity dispersions. As a\n158 G. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group\nresult, GCs are well separated from stars in the data: there is a\n200 km s\u22121 gap between the lowest velocity object we consider\na globular cluster and the highest velocity star. Specifically,\nwe classify objects with 500 < \u0001 < 1300 km s\u22121 as GCs,\nand objects with \u2212102 \u2264 \u0001 \u2264 332 km s\u22121 as stars. The lat-\nter range is in good agreement with the expected star field\nvelocity of about 60 km s\u22121 in the direction of NGC 3379 at\n(l, b) = (233.\u25e65, 57.\u25e66).\nWe then have a total sample of 42 GCs with radial veloci-\nties, listed in Table 1 along with various properties; 34 of these\nGCs have highly confident class A radial velocities, and 8 have\nlikely class B determinations. These form the basis for the anal-\nysis and discussion in subsequent sections.\nWe also have radial velocities for 36 stars in our field. This\nis consistent with expectations from the photometric survey of\nRZ04, which predicts that about 60% of our objects at a dis-\ntance of 4\u2032 from NGC 3379 are GCs, in agreement with the\n22 GCs and eleven non-GCs (stars and unclassified objects)\nwithin this radius. Most unclassified targets have V >\u223c 21 and\nare probable galaxies, compact but unresolved in the MOSAIC\nimages (typical seeing 1.\u2032\u20323) \u2013 including [O ii] emission line\nobjects at 0.35<\u223c z<\u223c 0.55 for the LR4 wavelength range. The\ntotal number of stars and background objects found is con-\nsistent with the work of RZ04, given our fibre allocation and\nV \u2264 22 limit.\n3. Properties of the globular cluster systems\nof NGC 3379 and NGC 3384\n3.1. Identifying globular clusters with NGC 3379\nand NGC 3384\nThe core of the Leo I group has a compact appearance on the\nsky with the central elliptical (E1) galaxy NGC 3379 sepa-\nrated by only 7\u2032 from the nearby SB0 galaxy NGC 3384, and\nby 10\u2032 to the small spiral NGC 3389, corresponding to pro-\njected distances of 20 and 29 kpc respectively. However, the\ngalaxies are fairly clearly delineated in their radial velocities,\nwith NGC 3379 at 904 km s\u22121, NGC 3384 at 721 km s\u22121, and\nNGC 3389 with 1300 km s\u22121. The velocity for NGC 3379 is\nthe average of the Updated Zwicky Catalogue (UZC, Falco\net al. 1999) and Smith et al. (2000) values, and the velocities\nfor NGC 3384 and NGC 3389 are from the UZC. The scat-\nter of measurements in the literature suggests uncertainties of\n10\u201320 km s\u22121 in these numbers.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the location and velocities of our\nGC sample overlayed on an image of the Leo I group. This fig-\nure shows the clear velocity offset of the group of GCs around\nNGC 3379, which all scatter around the galaxy\u2019s systemic ve-\nlocity, from the group around NGC 3384, which have veloci-\nties like that of NGC 3384 and are thus offset to lower \u0001 than\nNGC 3379 and its GC system. The velocity difference of these\ntwo galaxies and their GC systems is useful for determining\nwhich clusters in their outer halos belong to which galaxies\ngiven their closeness in projection on the sky.\nBased on their radial velocities and positions, we assign\nall of the GCs spatially centered around NGC 3379 to its\nGC system, along with the GCs located in intermediate spatial\nregions that have velocities greater than the systemic veloc-\nity of NGC 3379, and the globular gc756. We also assign\nthe eight GCs centered on NGC 3384 to this galaxy, and note\nthat these have a strong rotation signature, which we discuss\nfurther in Sect. 3.3. We consider the objects gc573, gc571,\nad1102, and ad1021 as possibly belonging to either galaxy.\nWe note that it would seem unlikely that NGC 3379 has only\nouter globulars to its south and not its north, so some of these\nfour would seem likely to belong to NGC 3379. On the other\nhand they are slightly closer in projection to NGC 3384, so\nsome of the four would appear likely to be associated with its\nhalo. The velocities of these four GCs are also generally con-\nsistent with NGC 3384 (see Fig. 4), but if none of them is as-\nsigned to NGC 3379, then its outer halo would have a strange\nbias towards only globulars with velocities greater than both\nthe systemic velocity of NGC 3379 and its inner GC system\n(a similar argument supports the identification of gc756 with\nNGC 3379). We also note that although at very large radii it\nmay become more sensible to consider the halo of the group of\ngalaxies together, given the clear velocity offset of the galaxies\nand their inner GC systems, a closer relationship to the individ-\nual galaxies is indicated over our field of view of \u224830 kpc.\nFor the calculations that follow, we use the assignments de-\nscribed above and given in Table 1, and also consider the effect\non these calculations of including or excluding various combi-\nnations of the GCs with uncertain assignments. As noted below,\nwe find that the conclusions are not significantly affected by the\nchoices in these assignments.\n3.2. Kinematics of the globular cluster system\nof NGC 3379\nOur sample of NGC 3379 GCs with radial velocities consists of\nthe 30 clusters clearly identified with NGC 3379 and the four\nfor which this assignment is uncertain. To these, we add eight\nadditional GCs from the study of P04 (see Sect. 2.2).\nFor the sample of 38 GCs associated with NGC 3379, we\nfind a mean of \u0001 = 947 km s\u22121 with an uncertainty of 38 km s\u22121\ndetermined via Monte Carlo simulations. The projected veloc-\nity dispersion of the full sample is \u03c3p = 169+20\u221220 km s\n\u22121\n. We\ndiscuss the \u03c3p as a function of radius in the following sec-\ntion, in which we use this to constrain the mass of the halo\nof NGC 3379. One additional note is that the mean value of the\nGC radial velocities is 1\u03c3 larger than the velocity of the galaxy\nat 904 km s\u22121 (Sect. 3.1). Our GIRAFFE data have good spec-\ntral resolution and are highly repeatable from night to night.\nMoreover, there is excellent agreement between our radial ve-\nlocities and the independent data of P04. Thus, the most likely\nexplanation is that the small offset is a statistical fluctuation,\nwhich can be tested with more data. For modelling purposes,\nwe will use hereafter the mean GC velocity of 937 km s\u22121 from\nthe central regions with good azimuthal coverage (Fig. 4).\nOur data also show little evidence for rotation in the\nNGC 3379 GC system. Although our sample size is modest,\neven with a much smaller sample we are able to detect rota-\ntion in NGC 3384 owing to our small velocity uncertainties\n(see Sect. 3.3). The exact constraint on the rotation around\nNGC 3379 depends somewhat on the sample definition, but\nG. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group 159\nTable 1.

Kinematics of the globular cluster system\nof NGC 3384\nOur sample also has eight GCs that are clearly associated with\nNGC 3384. Even with just these eight radial velocities, there is\nevidence for rotation (v\/\u03c3 \u223c 2) in the GC system of NGC 3384,\nwhich can be seen visually in Fig. 3. Specifically, the four GCs\nto the south-west of the galaxy centre have radial velocities\n200 km s\u22121 lower than the four to the north-east. This rotation\nsignature is very similar to that found by a study of 68 PNe\naround this galaxy by Tremblay et al. (1995).

GCs associated with NGC 3379\nare shown as squares (bold for class A; diamonds are eight additional\nGCs from P04), those associated with NGC 3384 as filled circles and\nGCs possibly associated with either galaxy as open circles.\nFig. 5. B\u2212R colours vs. radii for our spectroscopic sample of 42 GCs\n(symbols are as in Fig. 4). The plot shows the trend of redder colours\nfor GCs close to the NGC 3379 centre and bluer colours at large radii.\nMilky Way globular cluster system (e.g. Zinn 1985) is some-\nwhat unusual, and the rotation seen in the Messier 31 GC sys-\ntem (e.g., Perrett et al. 2002) is possibly more typical.\n3.4. Colours of the globular clusters around NGC 3379\nand NGC 3384\nWe can use our dataset to examine questions about the colours\nof the NGC 3379 and NGC 3384 GCs with a spectroscopically\nG. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group 161\nconfirmed dataset. In Fig. 5 we plot the B \u2212 R colours from\nRZ04 of our GC sample as a function of their distance from the\ncentre of NGC 3379. The data show that NGC 3379 has more\nblue, metal-poor GCs than red metal-rich ones, in agreement\nwith the suggestion of RZ04 from their photometry. As noted\nin that paper, of current models for the formation of GC sys-\ntems, only those that involve galaxy mergers (e.g. Ashman &\nZepf 1992; Beasley et al. 2002) are readily able to account for\nthis larger number of blue relative to red GCs in an elliptical\ngalaxy like NGC 3379 with its modest luminosity and small\nGC population.\nThe data shown in Fig. 5 also indicate a colour gradient\nin the GC system of NGC 3379, such that the ratio of blue to\nred GCs increases with distance away from the galaxy centre.\nThis is consistent with RZ04 and many other previous studies\nfor the globular cluster systems of a number of elliptical galax-\nies (see Ashman & Zepf 1998, for a review). However, RZ04\nalso noted that the photometry indicated that there may be red,\nmetal-rich GCs at large distances around some elliptical galax-\nies. In NGC 3379, our data show a metal-rich GC (gc581) at a\nprojected distance of almost 6\u2032, corresponding to about 17 kpc.\nThe GC ad1021 is also interesting in this regard, as it is very\nred, and is almost 10\u2032 away from NGC 3379 and about 5\u2032 away\nfrom NGC 3384. Thus there are two spectroscopically con-\nfirmed, metal-rich clusters well into the halos of these galax-\nies. We also note that two of the inner GCs associated with\nNGC 3384 are very red, which might be attributable to dust in\nthe system.\n4. Constraints on the halo of NGC 3379\n4.1. Velocity dispersion profile\nOne of the primary goals of this study is to determine the radial\nvelocities of GCs to probe the halo dynamics of NGC 3379. To\ntest mass models of the halo of NGC 3379, we use our dataset\nto determine the projected velocity dispersion at several dif-\nferent radii. As shown in Fig. 6, we adopt three radial bins to\nallow the comparison of the mass over a range of radii, corre-\nsponding in the inner region to the largest radial extent of the\nstellar data, in the intermediate region to the largest extent of\nthe PNe data, and the outer region which is uniquely probed\nby our globular cluster dataset. We then plot the projected ve-\nlocity dispersions \u03c3p in these three radial regions in Fig. 6. To\ncalculate \u03c3p, the mean velocity of \u00010 = 937 km s\u22121 is adopted,\nand the measurement uncertainties \u03b4\u0001i are taken into account.\nThe \u00b134% uncertainties are estimated by 30 000 Monte Carlo\nsimulated data sets drawn from the best-fit model. Note that the\ndispersion \u03c3p discussed throughout this paper incorporates any\nrotational support, and thus is technically \u0001rms = (\u00012p + \u03c32p)1\/2.\nFigure 6 shows the binned velocity dispersion profile. We\nestimate \u03c3p = 205+43\u221240 km s\u22121, 155+27\u221226 km s\u22121 and 147+44\u221239 km s\u22121\nat R \u223c 0.\u20328 (13 GCs), \u223c2.\u20325 (18 GCs) and \u223c11\u2032 (7 GCs), respec-\ntively. Inclusion of the four uncertain GCs has very little effect:\nthe outer \u03c3p becomes 147+33\u221232 km s\n\u22121\n. Alternatively adopting\n904 km s\u22121 for the NGC 3379 velocity has the effect of raising\nthe outer two \u03c3p estimates to 165+29\u221227 km s\u22121 and 165+48\u221244 km s\u22121.\nFig. 6. Projected velocity dispersion vs. radius for the NGC 3379 GCs.\nThe error bars show radially-binned data, where the vertical bars are\nfor the \u00b134% uncertainties, and the horizontal bars show the range\ncovered by 68% of the data. The dotted line shows a moving window\nestimate, with dashed lines signifying the \u00b134% uncertainties. The\nsolid line shows the best-fit scale-free power-law profile. The boxes at\nthe bottom indicate the radial positions of the GC velocity data.\nWe also construct a smoothed estimate of \u03c3p(R), using a\n\u201cmoving window\u201d. This performs a \u03c3p estimate at every ra-\ndius R using the nearby data (each estimate is thus not inde-\npendent). Unlike previous versions of this method which used\na window of constant width (Zepf et al. 2000; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2001)\nor with fixed number of data points (Kissler-Patig & Gebhardt\n1998; Cohen 2000), we use an exponential weighting function\nfor the contribution of each data point \u0001i to the estimate at ra-\ndius R:\nwi(R) = 1\n\u03c3R\nexp\n\u23a1\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3 (R \u2212 Ri)22\u03c32R\n\u23a4\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6 , (1)\nwhere the half-width \u03c3R \u221d [R\u03a3(R)]\u22121, and \u03a3(R) is the underly-\ning surface density distribution from which the measurements\nare drawn. For \u201cperfect\u201d sampling, the number of points con-\ntributing to each estimate is constant. For optimal smoothing,\nthe number of points within \u00b1\u03c3R has a maximum of \u223c25. For\nthe current data set, the surface density is the R1\/4 law found\nby RZ04, and the window width is normalised to \u03c3R \u000b 1.\u20328.\nFigure 6 shows the result of this procedure. The dispersion\nprofile is consistent with being constant over the wide range\nof radii studied, with a possible increase to small radii. The\ninclusion of the four uncertain GCs does not affect the pro-\nfile much, but a mean velocity of 904 km s\u22121 would raise \u03c3p\nin most places by 10\u201320 km s\u22121. Utilising a maximum likeli-\nhood technique for fitting the data to a scale-free power-law\n(see Appendix A), we also find the same result that the veloc-\nity dispersion is generally constant with radius with a possible\nmodest increase in the dispersion to small radii.\n162 G. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group\n4.2. Halo models\nA primary goal of this programme is to test whether our\nmeasured velocity dispersion profile for the GC system of\nNGC 3379 is consistent with the mass distribution expected\nfrom standard \u039bCDM halos or other models. To perform this\ntest, we construct mass models of NGC 3379 with and without\ndark matter halos. The circular velocity of these models is:\n\u00012c(r) =\n\u00012\u0002a\u0002r\n(r + a\u0002)2 + \u0001\n2\ns\n[\nrs\nr\nln\n(\n1 + r\nrs\n)\n\u2212 rs\nr + rs\n]\n, (2)\nwhere \u0001\u0002 and a\u0002 describe the stellar mass distribution (after\nHernquist 1990) and \u0001s and rs are the Navarro et al. (1996)\nNFW parameters of the dark matter halo. More accurate rep-\nresentations of the stellar and dark matter distributions are pos-\nsible (e.g. Mamon & \u0141okas 2005), but at this stage we wish to\nuse identical models to R03 for consistent comparisons.\nFor the stellar mass distribution, extensive studies of stel-\nlar dynamics in the inner regions of NGC 3379 (Kronawitter\net al. 2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000; Cappellari et al. 2005), find\nstellar mass-to-light ratios of \u03a5\u0002,B = 5\u20136 (in units of \u03a5\u0004,B).\nThese models neglect any dark matter found inside Re, so the\nactual \u03a5\u0002,B may be lower. The orbit models of R03 separate\nM(r) into the stellar and dark components, giving \u03a5\u0002,B = 6\n(based primarily on the kinematics of the stars rather than the\nPNe). Stellar population synthesis models with a Kroupa IMF\nimply \u03a5\u0002,B = 4\u20137 (Gerhard et al. 2001; Napolitano et al. 2005;\nCappellari et al. 2005). We adopt \u03a5\u0002,B = 5.8 as the overall\nbest estimate, and combine this with the observed light profile\nto construct the galaxy mass profile. The resulting stellar mass\nmodels for NGC 3379 gives \u0001\u0002 = 603 km s\u22121 and a\u0002 = 0.\u20323\n(Re = 0.\u20326) for use in Eq. (2) above.\nTo determine the \u0001s and rs values for a given \u039bCDM\nhalo, we compute the virial mass and radius, Mvir and\nrvir, and express the model halos in terms of Mvir and the\nconcentration cvir \u2261 rvir\/rs. In \u039bCDM, there is a well-\ndetermined mean relation between these parameters: cvir \u000b\n17.9(Mvir\/1011 M\u0004)\u22120.125, with a 68% log scatter of 0.14\n(Bullock et al. 2001; Napolitano et al. 2005). Our approach here\ndiffers from R03 in assuming a fluctuation amplitude\u03c38 = 0.9\nrather than 1.0, and in using a virial overdensity of 101 rather\nthan 200 \u2013 changes that permit less massive inner halos in\n\u039bCDM.\nWe then consider whether \u039bCDM halos with various\nmasses and concentrations are consistent with the velocity dis-\npersions we find for the NGC 3379 GCs. To do this, we cal-\nculate the projected velocity dispersion of the globular cluster\nsystem using a Jeans equation:\n\u03c32p(R) =\n2\n\u03a3(R)\n\u222b \u221e\nR\nrdr\u221a\nr2 \u2212 R2\n\u222b \u221e\nr\nj(r\u2032)\u00012c(r\u2032)dr\u2032\nr\u2032\n\u00b7 (3)\nIn making this calculation of the \u03c3p(R) expected for the\nGC system given a mass model for the galaxy, we assume\nthe following: 1) spherical symmetry; 2) isotropic distribu-\ntion function and Gaussian LOSVDs; 3) density distribution\nof tracers j(r) well-known; 4) dynamically negligible gas con-\ntent; 5) stellar mass-to-light ratio \u03a5\u0002 well-constrained by other\ntechniques.\nFig. 7. Model predictions compared to the observed velocity disper-\nsion profile of the NGC 3379 GCs. Error bars are as described in\nFig. 6. The hatched region describes profiles for typical \u039bCDM halos\nas described in the text. The solid line shows the \u201cconsensus\u201d model\nthat matches the H i data and provides a reasonable fit to the GC and\nPNe results. The dotted line represents a mass traces light model with\nNewtonian dynamics, while the dot-dashed line is with MOND.\nThe spherical assumption is motivated by the roundness\nof NGC 3379 (e.g. Peletier et al. 1990), the absence of evi-\ndence for substantial flattening of the GC system of NGC 3379\n(RZ04), and the evidence that globular cluster systems appear\nto be typically at least as round as their host galaxies (e.g.,\nAshman & Zepf 1998). Similarly, isotropy is observed for sys-\ntems where sufficient data are available (e.g. Zepf et al. 2000;\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. 2003); our \u03c3\u02c6p fits to the NGC 3379 GC velocities\ngive very similar results to traditional \u03c3p calculations, indicat-\ning that Gaussianity is a good approximation. The density dis-\ntribution we adopt is a Hernquist (1990) model which matches\nthe R1\/4 law fitted to the NGC 3379 globular clusters (RZ04):\nj(r) \u221d r\u22121(r + a)\u22123, where a = 9.\u20328 (Re = 17.\u20329). The mass of\nhot gas within 100 kpc of NGC 3379 is no more than \u2248108 M\u0004\n(David et al. 2005, conservatively assuming a linear increase in\ngas mass from the inner parts), which is a negligible fraction of\nthe stellar mass of M\u0002 \u2248 1011 M\u0004.\n4.3. Comparison of globular cluster system velocity\ndispersion to models\nThe comparison of the \u03c3p(R) of the GC data to predictions for\nvarious models of the mass distribution for NGC 3379 is shown\nin Fig. 7. The GC data are in good agreement with a wide va-\nriety of \u039bCDM halos that have typical concentrations for their\nmasses and match the inner stellar data. In detail, the range of\n\u039bCDM halos plotted is based on halos which fall within the 1\u03c3\nscatter in the halo mass-concentration relation of Bullock et al.\n(2001), with the additional constraints that the stellar mass to\nG. Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group 163\ndark halo mass is not lower than typical for galaxy clusters and\nis not larger than the cosmic baryon fraction.\nA valuable constraint on the halo mass of NGC 3379 is\nprovided by observations of a rotating ring of H i gas at R \u223c\n100 kpc (Schneider et al. 1983; Schneider 1985). The posi-\ntions and velocities of the H i are consistent with the gas be-\ning in a Keplerian orbit around the barycentre of NGC 3379\nand NGC 3384, with about 2\/3 of the mass within 100 kpc be-\nlonging to NGC 3379. This then gives a mass for NGC 3379\nof about 4\u20135 \u00d7 1011 M\u0004 at R \u223c 100 kpc and \u03a5B \u000b 25\u201335.\nA \u039bCDM halo model that matches the H i ring and is gener-\nally consistent with the GC and PN dynamical constraints is\nshown in Fig. 7. This \u201cconsensus\u201d model predicts a GC veloc-\nity dispersion that is close to that observed, with a preference\nfor smaller values.\nThis \u201cbest-fitting\u201d \u039bCDM halo is only slightly below the\nGC data and has a concentration well within the normal range\nfor a halo of its mass. The only notable feature of this \u039bCDM\nhalo is that it gives a fairly small mass-to-light ratio, with\n\u03a5B \u000b 35. Modest mass-to-light ratios for early-type galaxies\nwith luminosities around L\u2217 like NGC 3379 may be in agree-\nment with expectations from some recent halo occupation mod-\nels (e.g. van den Bosch et al. 2003), although the value for\nNGC 3379 is about a factor of two less than the model aver-\nage for galaxies of its mass. Another implication of the inferred\nmass-to-light ratio is that if the halo has the universal baryonic\nfraction of 0.17 of the concordance model, and given the \u03a5B\nof about 6 measured in the inner regions, the \u03a5B for the halo\nwould suggest most of the baryons have been turned into stars\n(see Napolitano et al. 2005, for this calculation for a number of\ngalaxies).\nOur data also allow us to assess alternatives to \u039bCDM ha-\nlos. Assuming no dark matter and a Newtonian force law, we\nexpect \u03c3p = 98 km s\u22121 at R = 2.\u20325 and 49 km s\u22121 at 10\u2032. This\nmass traces light model is clearly ruled out by the data (see\nFig. 7). We also consider MOND, which has been proposed to\nprovide a good fit to the earlier PNe data (Milgrom & Sanders\n2003). The comparison of our observed \u03c3p with the predic-\ntions of MOND is shown in Fig. 7. The velocity dispersion of\nthe GCs is slightly higher than the MOND prediction, although\nthe uncertainties mitigate against an unambiguous rejection of\nMOND.\nA final comparison is to the published velocity dispersions\nof NGC 3379 PNe (R03). The reasonable agreement of all of\nthe constraints with the overall \u201cbest-fit\u201d mass model indicates\nthat the GCs and PNe are broadly consistent. In detail, although\nthe PNe have a \u03c3p of about 120 km s\u22121 in the radial range of\n0.\u20327 \u2264 R \u2264 4\u2032 where the PN data overlap with our GC data,\ncompared to a \u03c3p of about 170 km s\u22121 for the GCs in the same\nregion, the two do not give greatly discrepant masses. This is\npartly due to radial anisotropy in the PNe system suggested by\norbital modeling of the PN system (R03), which naturally gives\na somewhat lower \u03c3p for the same mass, and partly due to the\nuncertainties in\u03c3p from the modest number of radial velocities.\nFurthermore, the GCs appear to have a shallower spatial profile\nthan the galaxy light (and by inference the PNe) in the relevant\nregion (RZ04) which would produce a smaller \u03c3p for the PNe\nrelative to the GCs. If additional data find a difference in the \u03c3p\nbeyond these effects, several possibilities present themselves.\nThese include the possibility that the GCs may have modestly\ntangential orbits, that orbits may be disturbed by group inter-\nactions, or that NGC 3379 may have a substantial disc compo-\nnent seen face-on (e.g. Capaccioli et al. 1991) which would be\nmore likely to include PNe than GCs. The question of the halo\nmass profile inferred for NGC 3379 has also been addressed\nin a recent paper by Dekel et al. (2005). They simulated disk\ngalaxy mergers and found that in the resulting elliptical galax-\nies, tracers like PNe have steeply declining \u03c3p profiles because\nof radially biased orbits, flattened triaxial structures, and steep\nspatial profiles. They predicted that GCs would be less prone to\nthese effects and should have flatter dispersion profiles, which\nis consistent with our results.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have used the FLAMES multi-fibre spectrograph on the\nVLT to obtain radial velocities of globular clusters (GCs)\naround the Leo I group galaxies NGC 3379 and NGC 3384.\nFLAMES allowed us to obtain spectra of 42 GCs over a wide\nfield (1\u2032<\u223c r <\u223c14\u2032) with very small uncertainties (\u223c10 km s\u22121).\n1. Our primary conclusion is that the projected velocity disper-\nsion of the GC system of NGC 3379 is consistent with that\nexpected from standard dark matter halos in \u039bCDM cos-\nmologies. This is based on comparing our observed velocity\ndispersions for the GC system over a wide range of radii to\nthe expectation from the Jeans equation for the mass profile\nof\u039bCDM halo models and the observed radial profile of the\nGC system.\n2. We find evidence that the GC system of the SB0 galaxy\nNGC 3384 has a rotation similar to that of the stellar disc\nand planetary nebula system of this galaxy. This result sug-\ngests that significant rotation in the globular cluster systems\nof disc galaxies may not be rare.\n3. We find a colour gradient in our spectroscopic sample such\nthat the fraction of red, metal-rich GCs decreases from small\nto large radii, in agreement with photometric studies. Even\nwith this colour gradient, we also find some red GCs at\nlarge distances from the centre of their host galaxy, which\nmay place interesting constraints on models for the origin\nof metal-rich globular clusters.\nAcknowledgements.

Bergond et al.: Wide-field kinematics of globular clusters in the Leo I group\nby assuming \u03c3p is constant within each bin. As an alternative,\nwe consider a maximum-likelihood technique for fitting dis-\ncrete velocity data to local velocity dispersions (see Ciardullo\net al. 1993; Saglia et al. 2000). This technique allows one to fit\ndata to a model for \u03c3p(R), which may be e.g. a constant disper-\nsion, a power-law, or the prediction of a Jeans model.\nWe convolve a Gaussian line-of-sight velocity distribution\n(LOSVD) with a Gaussian measurement function \u0001i \u00b1 \u03b4\u0001i to\nderive the likelihood of a given measurement \u0001i given a model\ndispersion \u03c3p(Ri):\nLi = 1\u221a\n\u03c32p + (\u03b4\u0001i)2\nexp\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n(\u0001i \u2212 \u00010)2\n2\n[\n\u03c32p + (\u03b4\u0001i)2\n]\n\u23ab\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23ac\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23ad , (A.1)\nwhich can be converted into a \u03c72 statistic:\n\u03c72 =\ni=N\u2211\ni=1\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23a9 (\u0001i \u2212 \u00010)\n2\n\u03c32p + (\u03b4\u0001i)2\n+ ln\n[\n\u03c32p + (\u03b4\u0001i)2\n]\u23ab\u23aa\u23ac\u23aa\u23ad . (A.2)\nThis method assumes Gaussian LOSVDs, so strictly speaking,\nwe are computing the best-fit Gaussian parameter \u03c3\u02c6p rather\nthan the true second-moment \u03c3p. For near-isotropic systems,\n\u03c3\u02c6p \u000b \u03c3p.\nTo apply this to our globular cluster data for NGC 3379,\nwe characterise the dispersion data by a scale-free power-law\nprofile:\n\u03c32p(R) = \u03c320(R\/R0)\u2212\u03b3p , (A.3)\nwhere R0 = 2.\u20322. We find \u03c30 = 168+21\u221219 km s\u22121 and \u03b3p = 0.25 \u00b1\n0.25 (see Fig. 6). This result is scarcely affected by including\nthe four uncertain clusters; on the other hand, adopting a mean\nvelocity of 904 km s\u22121 would mean \u03c30 = 177+21\u221221 km s\u22121 and\n\u03b3p = 0.20 \u00b1 0.25.\nThis dispersion estimator is checked using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. A small correction for estimator bias is derived\nusing the difference between the simulations\u2019 input and median\noutput. The (doubly-debiassed) 68% scatter of the simulations\ngives the likely range of the dispersion.\nReferences\nAshman, K. M., & Zepf, S. E. 1992, ApJ, 384, 50\nAshman, K. M., & Zepf, S.
