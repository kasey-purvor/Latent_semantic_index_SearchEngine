Both EL and PA powders were cold pressed at different pressures, ranging from 250 to 770 MPa, and sintered under vacuum in the range 580-640\u00b0C for 30-120 min. and then under pure nitrogen atmosphere for comparison. Vacuum degassing of the PA powder provided better compressibility and thus higher green densities than those for the as received PA or the premixed EL powder compacts pressed at compaction pressures \u00bf340 MPa. Near full sintered densities of ~98%TD were obtained for both EL and PA 6061 Al alloys. Degassed PA Al with 0\u00b76 wt-% paraffin wax (PW) or with only 0\u00b712 wt-%Pb addition as sintering aid and no lubricant, and premixed EL with only 0\u00b712 wt-%Pb addition and no lubricant gave the best optimum properties. It became apparent that additions of some solid lubricants such as lithium stearate (LS) and acrawax to both the premixed EL and PA powders provided reasonable green densities, but had deleterious effect on sintered densities and microstructures, particularly under vacuum sintering. Heating data curves during the sintering cycle, revealed formation of both transient and persistent liquid phases for the EL and mainly supersolidus liquid phase sintering (SLPS) mechanism for the PA.
