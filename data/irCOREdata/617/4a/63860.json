Introduction\nDuring the preparation of the Regional Geo-\nchemical Atlas of the Humber-Trent region (British\nGeological Survey, 2007) for the British Geological\nSurvey\u2019s Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Envi-\nronment (G-BASE) project, a series of strong and\ndistinctive geochemical patterns for a number of ele-\nments were observed over sedimentary ironstone\noutcrops in Lincolnshire, U.K., and are worthy of\nspecial attention. Possible explanations for the pat-\nterns observed are given and examined.\nThe English county of Lincolnshire hosts several\nMesozoic sedimentary ironstone formations, nota-\nbly the Frodingham ironstone at Scunthorpe, the\nMarlstone Rock in the south near Grantham, and\nthe Claxby ironstone which runs below the escarp-\nment of the Wolds from Spilsby north to Caistor\n(Fig. 1). The former are of Lower Jurassic age, the\nlatter is of Lower Cretaceous age, but all show some\ninteresting geochemical characteristics. Each of\nthese named \u2018ironstone formations\u2019 contain ferrugi-\nnous sandstones, limestones and mudstones in addi-\ntion to beds of true ironstones which generally\ncontain greater than 30% by weight Fe oxides. Sed-\nimentary ironstones, other than the more problem-\natic banded iron formations, are mainly lagoonal\n0883-2927\/$ - see front matter Crown Copyright \u0002 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The content of sulphides such as\npyrite is variable, depending largely on the original\norganic-matter content of the lagoonal sediments\nand the O2 fugacity during sedimentation and pre-\ncipitation, but is generally low in the ironstones\nunder consideration here. This is significant, as pyr-\nite can be an important carrier mineral for As, and\nsuch a readily-oxidised mineral would make the\nhigh As levels noted in this study much more mobile\nand potentially hazardous. A comprehensive expla-\nnation of sedimentary ironstone geochemistry can\nbe found in Maynard (1983), and Young and Taylor\n(1989). Elevated levels of other elements are often\nfound in sedimentary ironstones, notably Ca (as\nmany are impure limestones) and P, due to the reac-\ntion and sorption of solubilised organic and inor-\nganic phosphate with Fe(III) as hydroxide to give\nthe highly insoluble FePO4\u2013Fe(OH)3 additive com-\nplex. Strengite (FePO4 \u00c62H2O) and ferrihydrite\n(Fe(OH)3) can be considered to be the nominal\nend-members of this complex reaction series. One\nadditional feature of this sorption reaction is that\narsenate, AsO3\u00024 , can behave very similarly to phos-\nphate, PO3\u00024 , under these conditions (cf. Dixit and\nHering, 2003), and is also strongly sorbed to Fe\nhydroxide precipitates, resulting in elevated As lev-\nels in many sedimentary ironstones. Scorodite\n(FeAsO4 \u00c62H2O) is analogous to strengite and simi-\nlarly forms a complex reaction series with ferrihy-\ndrite, though the pure scorodite end-member is a\nrare mineral, which is only formed under strongly\nacidic conditions (e.g., in precipitates from acid\nmine drainage waters) and is not especially resistant\nto weathering. The peculiar sources and deposi-\ntional environment of sedimentary ironstones may\nalso lead to elevated levels of other trace elements,\nnotably those which are commonly believed to have\na \u2018resistate\u2019 mineral host, such as Cr, V, Th and the\nFig. 1.

Resistate elements\nare generally those whose host minerals are highly\nresistant to both chemical and physical weathering\nand hence have a very long residence time in soils\nand sediments. They are not necessarily the same\nas \u2018heavy minerals\u2019, though some heavy minerals\nare resistate.\n2. Topography and geological background\nMuch of Lincolnshire is relatively low-lying, but\nwith ridges of higher ground formed by a number of\nresistant geological formations, notably the Frod-\ningham and Marlstone Rock Bed ironstones, the\nLincolnshire Limestone, and the Chalk, which rises\nto over 160 m O.D. in the Wolds. A map of the\n\u2018solid\u2019 (Pre-Quaternary) geology is shown in\nFig. 1, and shows a broadly north\u2013south to NW\u2013\nSE pattern of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks ranging\nfrom the late Triassic (Mercia Mudstone Group)\nto the Upper Cretaceous (Chalk). The Quaternary\ngeological map (Fig. 2) shows a variety of coverings\nof till and fluvioglacial sands and gravels, lacustrine,\nriver and marine alluvium, peat and patches of\nblown sand. Holocene beach and Fen deposits, with\nsmaller areas of anthropogenic \u2018made ground\u2019, com-\nplete the sequence. The stratigraphic relationships\nare shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Of the three major iron-\nstones present, the Frodingham and Claxby beds\nare restricted to this area, while the Marlstone rock\nbed is more strongly developed to the south, notably\nin Leicestershire and Oxfordshire, and only crops\nout in the south of the area shown. The Frodingham\nironstone provided rich Fe ores and was extensively\nmined until recently, forming the basis for the steel\nindustry of Scunthorpe. The Claxby ironstone has a\nnarrow outcrop at the base of the Chalk escarpment\nand was worked on a much smaller scale, e.g., at\nFig. 1 (continued)\n1972 N.

The Marlstone rock bed was not worked in\nthe area of interest, but was formerly mined in the\narea immediately to the south, for example between\nGrantham and Melton Mowbray. Other much thin-\nner and impersistent ironstones are locally present\nat some other horizons within the Lias and Lower\nCretaceous (e.g., within the Hundleby and Tealby\nClays), but naturally show less prominent geochem-\nical features at outcrop.\n3. The G-BASE regional geochemical survey project\nThe Geochemical Baseline Survey of the Envi-\nronment (G-BASE) is a long-established, high-res-\nolution regional geochemical mapping project run\nby the British Geological Survey, aimed at making\na complete geochemical survey for the whole UK\nlandmass, and is described in detail in several pub-\nlications (Johnson and Breward, 2004; Johnson\net al., 2005). When sampling commenced in the\nlate 1960s the work was stimulated by mineral\nexploration, but this high-resolution survey has\nevolved continuously and now has many environ-\nmental applications. The geochemical mapping,\noriginally based on the collection of wet-sieved\nsub-150 lm drainage sediments at a target sam-\npling density of one stream sediment sample per\nkm2, has expanded to include the sampling and\nanalysis of stream waters and soils (sub-2 mm)\nand now also includes the systematic sampling of\nurban soils (Fordyce et al., 2005). Solid materials\nare analysed for some 38 elements by X-ray fluo-\nrescence spectrometry (XRFS), and filtered stream\nwaters (0.45 lm) are analysed mainly by induc-\ntively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrome-\ntry (ICP\u2013AES) and inductively-coupled plasma\nFig. 2.

Stream sediments\n(1342) and stream waters (1000) were taken from\nnatural first and second-order streams, and were\ntherefore limited to those areas of suitable surface\ndrainage. An average sampling density of only\none sample\/4 km2 was achieved for stream sedi-\nments over the area of interest, this relatively\nlow figure being due to the areas of limestone\nand chalk outcrop being devoid of low-order sur-\nface drainage, and the fenlands where much of the\nsurface drainage is in man-made ditches and\ndrains which do not accurately represent natural\nsurface drainage.\nFig. 5.

In addition to presenting\nresults in a series of geochemical atlases, G-BASE\nsamples and data are utilised in a wide range of\napplications and reported in peer-reviewed publica-\ntions. Recent publications have shown how these\nregional geochemical data can be used: to interpret\nsubtle geological changes (Stone et al., 2004); to\ndemonstrate the relationships between soils, heavy-\nmetal pollution and parent material (Breward,\n2003; Rawlins et al., 2002, 2003); in bioacessibility\nstudies (Palumbo-Roe et al., 2005), in archaeology\n(Chenery et al., 2001); and surface water research\n(Hutchins et al., 1999).\nThe geochemical maps shown here display a sub-\nset of the regional geochemical data used in the\nHumber-Trent Regional Geochemical Atlas (British\nGeological Survey, 2007), re-gridded at a suitable\nscale (100 m per pixel).\n5. Results and discussion\n5.1. Arsenic\nThe geochemical maps for As in topsoils and\nprofile soils are very similar (Figs. 5 and 6), with\nthe principal ironstone outcrops showing very high\nAs values. Minimum, maximum, mean and median\nvalues for As in soils and sediments over each of the\nmajor ironstones are given in Table 1.\nThe tight definition and spatial correlation of the\nanomalous As levels to the ironstone outcrops indi-\ncates both the high levels and the relative lack of\ndispersion and removal from the soil. Each of the\nironstones stands out sharply against the back-\nground, but it is of note that the coastal marine allu-\nvium deposits also show moderately high As levels\nin both soil horizons while the alluvium of the Fens\nand in the Humberhead Levels show higher levels in\nthe topsoils. The role of Fe oxides in influencing\nselected trace element concentrations in soils is dis-\ncussed in Hamon et al., 2004.\nFig. 7 shows As levels in stream sediments, giving\na broadly similar distribution pattern to that in the\nsoils, albeit with a rather less continuous coverage\ndue to the lack of natural first-order stream drain-\nage in some areas. High levels are present over the\nironstone outcrops, although there are only two\nstream sediment samples located directly on the\nMarlstone rock outcrop. The coastal and Humber-\nhead Levels alluvium is less well marked by elevated\nAs levels in the sediments than in the soils, but the\nanomalies in the Trent valley west of Lincoln are\nmore pronounced.\nMore significantly, the map for As in stream\nwaters (Fig. 8) shows no sign of elevated dissolved\nAs values over those areas of anomalously high\nsoils and sediment As. This is characteristic of\nthe very high stability of the As\u2013Fe sorption com-\npounds with regards to dissolution and the conse-\nquent very slow release and low solubility of As\nfrom this source. It would appear that conditions\nof low pH, low Eh and high soil microbiological\nactivity (giving rise to both reduction and methyl-\nation) may be required to mobilise a significant\namount of As from these ironstone soils (Alloway,\n1995). There is, therefore, very little health or envi-\nronmental risk from such high As levels in iron-\nstones as the bioaccessibility of the As appears to\nTable 1\nMinimum, maximum, mean and median values for As in soils and sediments over the ironstone outcrops\nSoil A (surface) Soil S (profile) Stream sediment\nMin Max Mean Median Min Max Mean Median Min Max Mean Median\nClaxby ironstone 14 342 70 50 7.6 389 78 62 15.4 210 70 60.5\nn = 98 n = 93 n = 76\nMarlstone rock bed 22 146 49 33 21.2 237 57 33.8 78 96 87a n\/a\nn = 20 n = 26 n = 2\nFrodingham ironstone 25 120 54 41.5 25.0 152 60 57.6 30 96 65 63\nn = 31 n = 28 n = 16\nRegional median value 15.5 16.5 16.9\nAll values in mg\/kg.\nn = Number of samples.\na Not reliable on such a small sample set.\nN.

The bioac-\ncessibility of As in soils and sediments derived from\nAs-rich ironstones has also been studied using the\nphysiology-based extraction test (PBET) selective\nextraction test derived by Ruby et al. (1996) and fur-\nther developed in BGS (Cave et al., 2003). This uses\nreagents and conditions designed to simulate the\nsolution and sorption characteristics of the human\ndigestive tract. The bioaccessibility of As in the sam-\nples has been found to be very low (Palumbo-Roe\net al., 2005; Wragg, 2005), using both PBET and\nother sequential-extraction and chemometric methods.\nThese showed that the bulk of the As was held in less\nreactive, low-solubility Fe phases, thus reinforcing\nFig. 8. Arsenic in stream water, Lincolnshire.1:625,000 geology lines. Gridded at 100 m\/pixel.\nN. Breward \/ Applied Geochemistry 22 (2007) 1970\u20131993 1979\nAuthor's personal copy\nthe observation that very little As is moving in solu-\ntion into the stream waters.\nThis clearly has implications for the treatment\nof \u2018contaminated\u2019 land. Many of the soils in these\nareas have total As levels well above the soil\nguideline values derived by the CLEA model of\n30 mg\/kg for residential areas (DEFRA, 2002)\nand would require \u2018remediation\u2019 in the event of\ndevelopment, even though the high levels are\nentirely natural and the As is almost completely\nimmobile and non-bioaccessible under normal sur-\nface conditions. The current legislation, based\nsolely on \u2018total\u2019 element analyses of soils, would\ntherefore appear to be seriously flawed in this\naspect, and refinements to these models (and\nthe legislation based on them) to take the bioac-\ncessibility of the \u2018contaminant\u2019 into account, are\nrecommended.\nThe high levels of As in the Claxby soils and\nsediments compared to those derived from the\nother ironstone outcrops are also worthy of note.\nThe ironstones of the Wealden district in southern\nEngland, which are similar in age to the Claxby\nironstone, do not show particularly high As levels\n(J D Appleton, BGS, pers. comm.) so this is not a\ngeneral feature of the Lower Cretaceous and a\nmore local sedimentation effect must be responsi-\nble. In the Wealden district, the Lower Cretaceous\nsedimentation follows the latest Jurassic shallow-\nwater marine sediments without a break, the only\nsignificant unconformity within the Lower Creta-\nceous being above the horizon of the ironstones.\nHowever, in Lincolnshire the base of the Creta-\nceous (the base of the Spilsby Sandstone is actu-\nally of uppermost Jurassic age, but this does not\naffect the case proposed) is transgressive west-\nwards over an uplifted late-Jurassic land surface,\nand exposed Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay\nwould have provided a source of sediment to the\nLower Cretaceous sea, the coastline of which\nwas probably not more than a few km west of\nthe current outcrop (Rawson, 1992). Both clay\nformations are relatively rich in S and organic\nmatter and thus might provide a richer source of\nAs and other elements to the lagoonal ironstone\ndepositional system. Subaerial weathering of these\nFig. 9. Profile soil chromium (red), vanadium (green) and lanthanum (blue) RGB addition map. 1:625,000 geology lines.\n1980 N.

Other elements\nArsenic is not the only trace element commonly\nobserved to be enriched in soils and sediments\nderived from sedimentary ironstones, and this is\ncertainly true of those in the study area. A three-\ncomponent RGB map (red\u2013green\u2013blue colour-\naddition map, see Breward, 2003) for profile soil\nCr, V and La is shown as an illustration (Fig. 9).\nThe major ironstone units are picked out clearly\nas bright near-white areas (indicating high levels\nof all three elements), especially the Claxby iron-\nstone outcrop which is very sharply defined. More\ndiffuse areas of moderately high values of supposed\n\u2018resistate\u2019 elements are shown in mid-grey by the\ncoastal marine alluvium, the Fen soils west of\nSkegness, parts of the Trent floodplain and the\nsuperficial deposits over the low-lying Upper Juras-\nsic clay outcrop to the east of the Lincolnshire\nLimestone ridge.\nThese trace elements may occur at elevated levels\nin ironstones either through chemical concentration\n(like As) or from the residual detrital fraction.

This sug-\ngests that the Frodingham soils are more disturbed\nand contaminated by outfall from the local iron and\nsteel industry, possibly by Fe-rich dusts from which\nthe As has been removed, which weakens the direct\ngeogenic correlation.\nThe patterns shown by V are broadly similar to\nthose given by As, again giving very strong correla-\ntions, but the sediments derived from the Froding-\nham ironstone show a breakdown in correlation at\nhigh Fe levels, though this is based on only two aber-\nrant samples and otherwise the correlation is strongly\npositive, similar to that in the soils. Whether this is\nagain a feature of the industrial overprint of the Scun-\nthorpe area on the Frodingham samples is not clear.\nIt is likely, given this strong correlation, that the\nenriched levels of V are, at least in part, due to\nin situ sorption and concentration by the sedimentary\nFe oxides during their formation.

The Cla-\nxby pattern clearly suggests a non-Fe oxide source\nfor the P, and the lack of a strong correlation with\nany other major soil or sediment component sug-\ngests an independent input source, possibly of\nagricultural fertiliser, though this is far from con-\nclusive. However, a strong correlation (r2 = 0.66\nfor >990 samples) between PO3\u00024 and NO\n\u0002\n3 in\nstream waters throughout Lincolnshire is typical\nof such an intensively farmed county with high\ninputs of fertilisers.
