KURUM, H.B. DONG, and J.D. HUNT\nA comparison has been made between the amount of microsegregation predicted by a numerical model\nand that found experimentally in Al-Cu alloys varying in composition between 1 and 8 wt pct Cu.\nA depleted region was predicted and observed experimentally near the Al2Cu. The depleted region\nwas formed below the eutectic temperature and had a significant effect on the ordered composition-\nfraction plots, particularly for high alloy compositions. Although the fit between experiment and the-\nory was reasonably good, it was concluded that it was necessary to propose that local equilibrium\nwas not maintained between the phases in the solid-state reactions.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEARLIER work on microsegregation was carried out\nby the authors in Al-Cu alloys using heat evolution in a\nsensitive single-pan calorimeter.[1,2] It was pointed out, in\nthe articles, that it is not possible to measure directly the\nfraction solid as a function of temperature and, thus, the\namount of microsegregation using calorimetry, unless it is\nassumed that the latent heat is constant and the heat evolved\ndoes not depend on the composition changes that occur dur-\ning solidification. However, it was possible to compare\nthe heat evolved using a model of microsegregation and a\nthermophysical software program like MTDATA.[3] When\nthis comparison was made, the experimental results com-\npared well with the predictions, except at the highest Cu\nconcentrations.[1] Despite the reasonable agreement, it was\nrecognized that calorimetry was a relatively insensitive\nmethod for investigating the progress of microsegregation,\nbecause there was only a small change in the amount of\nheat evolved for the two extremes of equilibrium freezing\nand there was no diffusion in the solid. For this reason,\nadditional experiments were carried out, investigating the\namount of microsegregation using the more traditional\nmethod of measuring composition as a function of sample\nfraction.[4] It was concluded that, although the amount of\neutectic at the eutectic temperature measured using the\ncalorimeter was as predicted, the final ordered composition-\nfraction plot did not fit well, particularly at high Cu con-\ncentrations. This type of behavior has been found by other\nauthors.[5,6] It was noticed that small changes in the phase\ndiagram (in particular, the solidus and solvus) and the tem-\nperature dependence of the solid-diffusion coefficient\naffected the predicted results. For this reason, parts of the\nphase diagram and the solid-state diffusion coefficient were\nremeasured as a check on the input data. The results of these\nmeasurements and a comparison with a new series of Al-Cu\nalloys, varying from 1 to 8 wt pct Cu, are reported in this\narticle.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE\nA. Measurement of the Phase Diagram\nSuperpure Al (99.9999 wt pct) and pure Cu (99.999 wt\npct) were used to make up the alloys. The measured alloy\ncompositions are shown in Table I.\nThe liquidus was measured using the single-pan calorime-\nter. The thermocouples were calibrated with pure Al, and the\nliquidus temperature was taken to be the break as the last\nsolid melts. The results are shown in Table II and Figure 1.\nThe results do not differ significantly from previous work.\nThe solidus and solvus were measured using electron-\nprobe microanalysis (EPMA) after a long anneal at a num-\nber of different temperatures.[14] The length of the anneal\nwas made greater than 10 x2\/D (where x is the scale of the\nmicrostructure and D is the solid-state diffusion coefficient).\nThe results are shown in Tables III and IV. Figure 2 com-\npares the results with previous work. The solidus line is\ntoward the top of the previous results and is well away from\nthat predicted by MTDATA. The solvus line agrees rea-\nsonably well with that predicted by MTDATA, but is above\nthat of Matsuyama.[10] The phase diagram used in the future\ncalculations is shown by the dotted line in Figure 2.\nB. Measurement of the Solid-State Diffusion Coefficient\nThe solid-state diffusion coefficient was measured using\nan Al\/\/Al-2 wt pct Cu diffusion couple, prepared by Alcan\nInternational Research Laboratories using roll bonding.[14]\nThe composition-distance plots before and after annealing\nwere measured using EPMA along a series of lines (15 \u0001m\napart) parallel to the junction between the two materials. The\ncomposition along the line was averaged and plotted against\ndistance. Three different annealing temperatures were used.\nThe composition profile was fitted with the least-squares error\nfit for all the points, assuming a constant diffusion coeffi-\ncient.[14] From this Arrhenius plot, the pre-exponential con-\nstant (Do) is taken to be 2.04 10\u00025 m2\/s and the activation\nenergy is taken to be 127.504 kJ\/mol. The results, using Do\nand the activation energy, are compared with previous work\nin Figure 3.\nC. Measurement of the Composition-Fraction Plots\nThe technique used to more directly measure the microseg-\nregation in this work and in the authors\u2019 earlier work was\nGungor\u2019s method.[4] Using this technique, the composition\nMETALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 36A, NOVEMBER 2005\u20143103\nE.C.

COMPARISON OF THE MODEL\nPREDICTIONS WITH EXPERIMENT\nThe plots in Figure 4 were compared with predictions cal-\nculated using the numerical model named Alloy.[18] Alloy is a\nfully implicit backdiffusion-based model treating diffusion in\na cylinder. More details of the model are given in Reference\n19. The actual temperature-time curves, obtained in the calorime-\nter for the different alloys, were used as an input to the model.\nThe solid-state diffusion coefficient is assumed to vary with\ntemperature, and an allowance is made for the dendrite-tip\nundercooling. Local equilibrium is assumed to occur at the\nboundary between phases. Thus, after the eutectic temperature,\nthe aluminum at the boundary between the single phase and\nthe eutectic should follow the solvus. This leads to one of the\ncomplications of using Gungor\u2019s method to measure microseg-\nregation. Since the solid solubility of Cu in Al is reduced below\nthe eutectic temperature, the boundary composition in the pri-\nmary Al is reduced to a level often lower than that at the cen-\nter of the dendrite. A true microsegregation plot is then similar\nto the experimentally measured plot along the line shown in\nFigure 6 for the 4 pct Cu alloy. The important point is that the\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d )\nFig. 5\u2014Backscattered images of the 1 to 8 pct Cu samples taken in the microprobe.

This observation illustrates the fact that the Gungor plot\nis not a microsegregation plot when more than one phase is\npresent. This observation seems to have been neglected in the\npast. For comparison with experimental measurements, the pre-\ndicted microsegregation plot obtained from the numerical model\nwas converted into ordered plots (this was done by taking the\ncomposition of each control volume and placing them in ascend-\ning order while summing the relevant volumes).\nThe newly measured phase diagram and the diffusion\ncoefficient were used for the calculations. The program was\nrun while treating the spacing as a variable to see whether\nany one spacing would fit the experimental plots, since it\nwould be impossible to get a definitive single spacing from\nthe microstructure. The approximate spacings are given in\nTable V. The simulations with three different spacings are\nshown in Figures 7(a) through (h). The three spacings were\nchosen arbitrarily, but were chosen to be similar to those\ncrudely estimated from the samples (Table V).\nFor the 1 pct Cu alloy shown in Figure 7(a), a good fit\nis obtained at low compositions for a spacing of 330 \u0001m.\nHowever, changing the spacing to get a better fit at high\nFig. 5\u2014(Continued).

The model did not predict any eutectic for the three\nspacings shown, but a very small amount was found in the\ncompositional measurements.\nFor the 2 pct Cu alloy, there is a reasonable fit at low con-\ncentrations for the spacing of 260 \u0001m (Figure 7(b)) but, again,\nthe overall fit is not improved by changing the spacing. No\neutectic was predicted for the two smaller spacings, but it was\npresent for the largest spacing. It is interesting to note the\nchange in the form of the profile when eutectic forms. This\nis the result of the Al in the boundary following the solvus.\nFor the 3 and 4 pct Cu samples, a good fit can be obtained\nover much of the sample (Figures 7(c) and (d)), but there\nis a poor fit at the highest concentrations. Eutectic is pre-\ndicted for all three spacings.\nSimilar results were obtained for the 5, 6, 7, and 8 pct Cu\nalloys, but the overall fit gets worse as the composition\nincreases from 5 to 8 pct Cu (Figures 7(e) through (h)).\nVarious reasons can be suggested to explain the poor fit\nat high concentrations or high volume fractions.\n(1) The volume activated by the electron beam in the micro-\nprobe is about 2 \u0001m and could contain two phases (Al\nand Al2Cu), giving higher Cu contents than actually\nexist. This explanation is useful to explain the poor fit\nnear the boundary, but it is not sufficient to explain the\nmore extensive poor fit in the samples.\n(2) Any real structure consists of a wide range of spacings.\nIn principle, it is possible that a combination of differ-\nent spacings could lead to a fit over the whole compo-\nsition range. This explanation is unlikely because, at the\n3108\u2014VOLUME 36A, NOVEMBER 2005 METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A\nFig. 8\u2014Al-Cu phase diagram showing the shifted solvus.\nhighest compositions in the 5 to 8 pct Cu alloys, the\ncomposition varies very little with spacing (Figure 7(h)).\nThe small variation is a result of the peak composition\non the microsegregation plot, being insensitive to changes\nin spacing. It would be necessary for at least one spac-\ning to have a higher concentration than that from the\nexperiment to get a good fit at high concentrations. This\nwas not possible for any reasonable spacing. The range\nof spacings does, however, explain why a small amount\nof eutectic was formed in the 1 and 2 pct Cu alloys. The\neutectic forms in small pockets of liquid in the regions\nof largest spacing in the sample.\n(3) For simplicity, the effect of coarsening[20,21] was\nneglected in the present numerical model. The previ-\nous approaches[22\u201325] were felt to be very approximate\nand introduced parameters which were not easily mea-\nsured. A small increase in the solid-state diffusion coef-\nficient could be employed to allow for coarsening. It is\nclear that any coarsening model would reduce the max-\nimum height on the Gungor plot, so this omission was\nnot felt to be the cause of the discrepancies.\n(4) In the model, it is assumed that the boundary between\nphases is maintained at the local-equilibrium composition\nfor the two phases. This assumption is thought to be valid\nfor solidification of a nonfaceted material, but is less likely\nto be true for a solid-state reaction. From the calculations,\nit became apparent that the poor fit at high concentrations\non the 5 to 8 pct Cu alloys could be because the com-\nposition on the primary Al side of the boundary did not\nfollow the solvus. This could arise because the kinetics\nof the growth of Al2Cu was difficult, and the process\nshould be considered to be only partially diffusion-\ncontrolled. In principal, it might be possible, knowing the\ngrowth rate of the Al2Cu, to calculate how much the com-\nposition should shift, but this was not done in the pre-\nsent work. Instead, the position of the solvus was arbitrarily\nshifted (refer to the shifted solvus line in Figure 8) to\ndetermine whether departure from the equilibrium solvus\nwould account for the present experimental results.\nFigure 9 shows new simulations with the shifted solvus\nalong with the equilibrium solvus. No change occurs for the\n1 and 2 pct Cu samples (Figures 9(a) and (b)) due to the fact\nthat no eutectic is formed for these compositions in the model,\nso the solvus is not used. However, for all the other samples,\nthe simulation plot is shifted up, improving the fit. The shift\nis largest for the high-concentration alloys, giving a better over-\nall fit with change in composition (Figures 9(e) through (h)).\nThis fit is discussed in more detail in the following section.\nFig. 7\u2014(Continued). Experimental ordered microsegregation plots compared with simulations: (a) 1 wt pct Cu, (b) 2 wt pct Cu, (c) 3 wt pct Cu, (d) 4 wt pct\nCu, (e) 5 wt pct Cu, ( f ) 6 wt pct Cu, (g) 7 wt pct Cu, and (h) 8 wt pct Cu.\nMETALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A VOLUME 36A, NOVEMBER 2005\u20143109\nFig. 9\u2014Experimental ordered microsegregation plots compared with simulations using the solvus and the shifted solvus, for (a) 1 wt pct, (b) 2 wt pct,\n(c) 3 wt pct, (d) 4 wt pct, (e) 5 wt pct, ( f ) 6 wt pct, (g) 7 wt pct, and (h) 8 wt pct.\nIV. THE EFFECT OF SHIFTING THE SOLVUS\nThe 1 pct Cu alloy could be fitted reasonably well by the\nequilibrium phase diagram for most of the sample. It is sug-\ngested that the poor fit at the highest volume fraction was the\nresult of spreading near the phase boundary. The small amount\nof eutectic was the result of the wide range of spacings pre-\nsent on the sample. The eutectic forms in the regions with the\nlargest spacing. The estimated spacing was 390 \u0001m (Table V),\nand the spacing used in the calculation was 330 \u0001m.\nThere is a poor fit for the 2 pct Cu alloy both in Figures\n7(b) and 9(b). It is suggested that the reason for this is that\nthe 2 pct Cu alloy is near the borderline between forming eutec-\ntic and not forming eutectic at the relevant spacing. This means\nthat very different behaviors occur over the range of spacings\npresent on the sample. In contrast, there is a reasonable fit for\nthe 1 pct Cu alloy because there is so little eutectic, and there\nis a reasonable fit in the 3 pct Cu alloy because eutectic is\nformed for all spacings near the average spacing.\nThere is a good fit for most of the volume fraction for\nthe 3 and 4 pct Cu alloys (Figures 9(c) and (d)). The shift-\ning of the solvus has little effect for these alloys. As for the\n1 pct Cu alloy, it is suggested that spreading near the phase\nboundary produces the poor fit at the highest concentrations.\nThe amount of eutectic is close to the calculated value. The\nestimated spacings (Table V) were 250 and 200 \u0001m, and\nthese should be compared with the spacings of 240 and\n200 \u0001m used in the calculations.\nThere is a good fit for most of the volume fraction for\nthe 5 and 6 pct Cu alloys (Figures 9(e) and (f)) for the shifted\nsolvus. As before, it is suggested that spreading near the\nphase boundary produces the poor fit at the highest con-\ncentrations. The amount of eutectic is not very close to the\ncalculated value. The estimated spacings (Table V) were\n185 and 175 \u0001m, and these should be compared with the\nspacings of 170 and 142 \u0001m used in the calculations.\nThere is a good fit for most of the volume fraction for\nthe 7 and 8 pct Cu alloys (Figures 9(g) and (h)) for the\nshifted solvus. As before, it is suggested that spreading near\nthe phase boundary produces the poor fit at the highest con-\ncentrations. The amount of eutectic is close to the calculated\nvalue. The estimated spacings (Table V) were 150 and 130 \u0001m,\nand these should be compared with the spacings of 146\nand 140 \u0001m used in the calculations.\nSince it is difficult to decide where the eutectic starts in\nthe experimental composition vs volume-fraction plots, the\narea above the point where the composition began to rise\nrapidly was calculated in an attempt to make a comparison\nwith theory. This area was then used to calculate the fraction\neutectic if it were all of the eutectic composition. This pro-\ncedure gives the dotted lines plotted in Figures 9(a) through\n(h). The fit is reasonable for most of the samples, particularly\nfor the 7 and 8 pct Cu samples.\nV. SUMMARY\nThe microsegregation model used in the present work\nhas the advantage of treating diffusion below the eutectic\ntemperature. Both the model and experiment showed that a\ndepleted layer occurred in the Al near the eutectic, resulting\nfrom solid-state diffusion. It was shown that the depleted\nlayer has a significant affect on the shape of the Gungor plot.\nThis means that the Gungor plot is not a true microsegrega-\ntion plot.\nCalculations showed that a detailed fit between theory and\nexperiment depended on the position of the solvus and the\ntemperature dependence of the solid-state diffusion coeffi-\ncient. These parameters were remeasured as an independent\ncheck. The results, although different, were not significantly\ndifferent from previous work.\nWhen the measured parameters were used in the model,\nthe fit obtained was reasonably good. The remaining dis-\ncrepancies were discussed, and the following conclusions\nwere made.\n(1) The presence of a small amount of eutectic in the 1 pct\nCu alloy was felt to be the result of a range of spacings\npresent on the sample; this also led to problems with\nthe 2 pct Cu alloy.\n(2) It was felt that the activated volume in EPMA led to\nsome smearing at the highest Cu concentrations, but this\ncould not explain the more extensive poor fit in the high-\nCu-composition alloys.\n(3) Modeling with a shifted solvus showed that a better fit\nwas obtained for the high-composition alloys. It is sug-\ngested that this observation provides some evidence that\nlocal equilibrium at the interface is not achieved for the\nsolid-state reactions below the eutectic temperature.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors thank Alcan International Limited for finan-\ncial support and supplying the samples.\nREFERENCES\n1.
