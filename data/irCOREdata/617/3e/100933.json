In fact, a-C films with intrinsic stress values\ns,12 GPad of almost one order of magnitude higher than\nthose found in other amorphous materials s,1 GPad such as\na-Si, a-Ge, or metals have been reported. Excessive stress on\nthin films can cause adhesion problems where the film\ndelaminates from the substrate. The presence of high stress\non a-C has been reported to have induced changes in the\nelectronic properties such as electrical conductivity.3 The a-C\nfilms with high sp2 concentrations s,90% d can have high\nintrinsic stress and a local density close to those found in\ntetrahedral amorphous carbon sTACd thin films.1 The high\ncompressive stress in these graphite-like a-C sGACd films is\na result of the ion bombardment during the deposition pro-\ncess that \u201cknock-on\u201d carbon which subimplant into the films\nand thus create regions of high stress.4 This results in the\ndensification of the films which increase the local density. It\nis known from theoretical studies that by applying pressure\nsstressd to a material one can modify its electronics proper-\nties, e.g., band structure, resistivity, position of Fermi\nlevel.5,6 The influence of internal pressure on the electron\nemission properties of nanocomposite thin films which con-\ntain nano-graphite has been reported by Poa et al.7 in which\nby varying the deposition conditions, the properties of the\nnano-graphite as a function of stress were studied. The ob-\nserved low threshold field was explained by the amount of\nintrinsic stress induced within the carbon matrix. Basically,\nthe variation in field emission characteristics with intrinsic\nstress can be driven by two effects: s1d band structure modi-\nfications in the film and s2d increases in local density within\nthe film. In both cases, the beneficial effect is the lowering of\nfield emission threshold fields and\/or increasing the electric\nfield enhancement factor. Due to the dielectric mismatch\nwithin the carbon films, electric field lines terminate at the\nmore conductive regions of the film surface. The crowding of\nthe field lines result in an increase in the local electric field\nbetween the dielectric interfaces, increasing the field en-\nhancement for electron emission.\nIn this work the a-C\/silicon substrate is physically bent\nto induce external stress on the a-C films. The effect of the\napplied external pressure was then examined in terms of the\nelectron field emission characteristics. We further show that\nprevious results attributed purely to the effects of sp2 \/sp3\nbond hybridizations may equally well be explained using an\nargument based on stress in thin films.\nThe graphitic a-C sGACd films studied in this investiga-\ntion were deposited by an ion beam assisted deposition\nsIBADd technique using two Kauffman ion sources. Films\nproduced from this technique are mainly graphitic, with a sp2\nconcentration of up to 90% as determined by electron energy\nloss spectroscopy. Details of the deposition system have been\ndescribed elsewhere.8 Stress measurements were performed\nusing films deposited on c-Si bars of 20 mm by 5 mm, and\napplying an optical bending beam method.9 The field emis-\nsion sFEd characteristics of these films were determined us-\ning a sphere-to-plane technique with a separation distance\nbetween the anode and cathode of 20 mm. The threshold\nfield sEthd is defined as the macroscopic electric field where\nan emission current of 1 nA is observed. The samples are\nbent using a fiber placed in the middle of the sample, with\ntwo glass slides used to clip down both ends of the sample to\ncreate a curvature as shown in Fig. 1. Different sizes of fibers\nare used, from 50 to 250 mm, which allows for different\ncompressive stresses to be applied onto the a-C films.\nadAuthor to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail:\ns.silva@surrey.ac.uk\nAPPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS 86, 232102 s2005d\n0003-6951\/2005\/86~23!\/232102\/3\/$22.50 \u00a9 2005 American Institute of Physics86, 232102-1\nDownloaded 30 Mar 2009 to 131.227.178.132.

Previous examination of the\nfield emission properties of TAC have been explained by\nconsidering the influence of different bond hybridization,\nwith higher sp3 bonding found to enhance field emission.10\nWe take this data and now plot it as a function of ion energy\nwith the data found in the literature together with data from\nour own highly sp2-rich a-C films, Fig. 2. The effects of\nintrinsic stress and ion energy for both TAC and GAC are\nshown in Fig. 2sad. The TAC films were deposited using the\nfiltered ion beam technique by Fallon et al.11 and the intrinsic\nstress in Fig. 2 is seen to be maximum s11 GPad at about 140\neV ion energy. The GAC films deposited using IBAD tech-\nnique with krypton show a maximum stress of 11.7 GPa at\n300 eV. This optimum energy is dependent on many factors\nwith the deposition system being used primary among\nthem.12 Despite two different deposition techniques, similar\ntrends have been observed, where a maximum stress is ob-\nserved at an optimum energy, which starts to decrease with\nincreasing energy.\nThe field emission results obtained from Ref. 10, are\nshown in Fig. 2sbd for the TAC and GAC films sthis workd,\nwhere the lowest threshold fields s8 and 23 V\/mm, respec-\ntivelyd are observed in the region where the films have the\nhighest stress. The variation of threshold field and intrinsic\nstress for all the a-C films, in a combined plot, is shown in\nFig. 3, where it can be seen clearly that the lowest threshold\nfields are from those films with the highest intrinsic stress. It\nis important to note that the definition of field emission\nthreshold field in Ref. 10 is different from this work where\nan emission current density of 1 mA\/cm2 was used to define\nthe threshold field. However, it is still suitable to compare\nthe data qualitatively as the threshold fields are consistent\nwith the results reported in the literature.\nSatyanarayana et al.10 proposed that for TAC films to\nexhibit low threshold fields, high sp3 content within the films\nshould be present. It was suggested by the authors that, nega-\ntive electron affinity may be responsible for the reduction of\nthe emission barrier. However, TAC is not a negative elec-\ntron affinity material with its work function being 3.5\u20134\neV.13 Interestingly, the threshold fields decrease with increas-\ning sp3 concentration, which is the opposite dependence to\nlaser ablated TAC films14 and GAC films shown in Fig. 3.\nThe samples studied by us are highly graphitic and have the\nlowest emission threshold fields when the sp3 content was a\nminimum. Therefore, this suggests that other mechanisms\nare important in controlling the field emission properties and\nin some cases more dominant than the sp3 bond content.\nTo investigate the effects of externally applied stress on\nthe field emission from carbon thin films, three films with\ndifferent stress are subjected to bending experiments to\nstimulate controllable external stress application on films.\nDifferent krypton assisted films are used to represent films\nwith low s1 GPad, medium s6.5 GPad and high intrinsic stress\ns11.7 GPad. By bending the substrate as shown in Fig. 1, the\nchange in curvature results in an increase of the stress within\nthe thin film. The stress is compressive on the Si\/GAC in-\nterface and tensile on the GAC\/air interface. The changes in\nthe substrate curvature due to bending are calculated using\nStoney\u2019s equation. It is difficult to calculate the induced\nstress within the thin GAC films and therefore the curvature\nin Fig. 1 is used on a qualitative basis for comparison to\ncurvature modifications. The bending of the low stress film\nshows a very interesting sequence of results, as shown in\nFig. 4. Upon the application of external stress, Eth initially at\n37 V\/mm falls to 24 V\/mm, as the amount of stress is in-\ncreased due the change in the curvature. This reduction of Eth\nwe believe is due to the increase of internal stress by having\nan external compressive force applied on the film. As the\ncurvature is further increased to the highest level, we believe\nthere is significant structural modification sreversibled in the\ngraphitic planes which relaxes the microstructure due to the\nFIG. 2.

Interestingly,\nwhen the sample is tested after the curvature has been re-\nmoved, the field emission threshold field resets itself to the\noriginal value of 35 V\/mm, emphasizing the elastic behavior\nof the film which can be subjected to repeated bending\ncycles. This appears to support a phenomenon which is more\nlikely to be related to electronic modification as opposed to\nstructural changes. In the case of the films with medium\nstress, similar trends are observed in the bending process.\nHowever, when the film with the highest stress is bent, there\nis no decrease of Eth below the initial value. This can be\nattributed by the high intrinsic stress within the films not\nbeing exceeded by the external pressure on the film or the\nphenomenon responsible for the electron density\/decrease in\nthreshold exceeding the \u201cstress threshold value.\u201d\nThe effect of stress on the field emission properties of\na-C thin films has not be often discussed in the literature.\nCommonly, intrinsic stress is only associated with the sp3\nconcentration in a-C films and is ignored due to delamina-\ntion of the films. However, from the bending results in Fig. 4,\nit is clear that stress can play a crucial role in the field emis-\nsion results. Interestingly, the threshold field resets itself after\nthe bending experiment which suggests that the modification\ndue to stress is reversible. In comparison to single wall car-\nbon nanotubes, applying radial deformation to a nanotube\ncan vary the band gap from semiconducting to metallic.15\nDepending on the type of tubes and the relative position of\nthese bands, the band gap displays different behavior to\nstrain. In general, the band gap decreases and eventually\ncloses to form a semiconducting to metallic transition. How-\never, the band structure in amorphous materials is not well\ndefined, for example, in a-C films, it is predominantly con-\ntrolled by its p and s bonding and there are localized states\nfound in the midgap region. It is possible that under strain,\nthe localized states within the a-C film are pushed closer\ntogether and hence deform the band structure to favor elec-\ntron emission.\nThis experiment illustrates a drop of 10\u201315 V\/mm by\nsimply creating a curvature of 3 on the film with low and\nmedium stress. The fact that the process is reversible and\nhighly reproducible bodes well for the possibility of fabrica-\ntion of highly sensitive pressure sensor based on electron\nfield emission. For example, for a constant electric field of\n35 V \/mm a FE current of 1 nA is recorded. Now, when the\ncurvature of 3 is applied to the film, while the constant elec-\ntric field of 15 V\/mm is applied, a new current of 1 mA is\ndetected. Due to a small change in threshold field, very large\nchanges in FE currents are recorded.\nIn conclusion, we have examined the variation of elec-\ntron field emission with stress. The effect of intrinsic stress is\nshown to make a significant contribution to factors control-\nling the process of electron field emission. The lowest thresh-\nold fields were observed in films possessing the highest\nstress. By bending the films, we observe variations in the\nthreshold field which we believe to be the result of electron\ndensity variations within these films.\nAll authors gratefully acknowledge financial support\nfrom the EPSRC Carbon Based Electronics program.\n1See, for example, Properties of Amorphous Carbon, edited by S.
