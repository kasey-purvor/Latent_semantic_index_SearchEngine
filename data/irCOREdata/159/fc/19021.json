Even\nthough there has been much research investigating\nthese forms of movement it still remains unclear to\nwhat degree the limbs are controlled independently or\nconcurrently. A major question is whether the most\nefficient way to control the separate upper limbs is\nthrough combining their control mechanisms at a high\nneural level or for their control to remain independent\nfrom one another. Wang and Sainburg (2003) have\nshown that, during a unimanual movement, learning a\nvisuomotor rotation with one arm did not interfere\nwith learning the opposite visuomotor rotation with the\nother arm. They concluded that the neural processes of\neach arm are independent. Transfer of learning is not\nobligatory but, when beneficial, they suggest a link can\nbe made between the control mechanisms.\nHence there is a possibility that the two control\nsystems remain largely independent but converge\nfunctionally at various areas in the brain. Evidence for\nthis convergence is found in a number of different\nstudies. Performing two different tasks simultaneously\noften results in mutual interference but dissociation\ncan occur with training, which suggests that learning is\nrequired to separate the incoming information within\nthese various areas (Wenderoth et al. 2003). Eliassen\net al. (2000) have shown that callosal transmission af-\nfects the degree of bilateral synchrony within simple\nbimanual movements implying that the corpus callo-\nsum is integral in synchronizing the movement.\nWenderoth et al.

In particular they hypothesize that inter-\nference occurs when computational resources in the\nparietal areas are insufficient to code two incompatible\nmovement directions independently from each other.\nIn addition, Johansson et al. (2006) believe that when\nperforming a bimanual task there is high degree of\ninteraction between the two limbs. They showed that\nsubjects are able to choose the hand with the greatest\nnatural spatial mapping between actions and goals as\nthe primary actor, irrespective of the preferred hand.\nThis involved a high degree of flexibility and commu-\nnication between the limbs as their roles were inter-\ndependent on one another. It implies that bimanual\nperformance involves two independent actions evolv-\ning into a meaningful gestalt which can then be adap-\nted to perform optimally in a given environment\n(Swinnen and Wenderoth 2004).\nIn contrast, no interference has been found when\nsubjects learn two novel opposing visual rotations\nduring alternating pointing tasks. Mikaelian and Mal-\natesta (1974) and Prablanc et al. (1975) used prismatic\ndisplacement, exposing subjects to a visual displace-\nment for one arm and then the opposite displacement\nfor the other arm. They found that both arms adapted\nto the specific displacement and suggested independent\nneural mechanisms for the two limbs. Bock et al.\n(2005) extended this finding using a visual distortion\nproduced via a computer screen. They found the time\ncourse of adaptation was similar for both hands and the\nmagnitude of adaptation was comparable to unimanual\ndata. They concluded that the two adaptive states were\nformed concurrently and without interference or\nfacilitation.\nHowever, an important criticism of these three\nstudies is that the subjects learnt the opposing dis-\nplacements during epochs of unimanual movement,\nwhich intermittently changed from side to side on a\ntime scale ranging from 20 s (Bock et al. 2005) up to\n3 min (Prablanc et al. 1975). Even with the 20-s sce-\nnario, the subject produced up to 15 movements before\nswapping arms. Hence there is considerable opportu-\nnity for unilateral adaptation within each of these\nepochs.\nAnother important limitation in Bock et al. (2005) is\ntheir comparison of unimanual and alternating adap-\ntation using data from two separate studies. As a\nconsequence they were unable to compare the full time\ncourse of adaptation, and could only compare the\nmagnitudes of adaptation after a given time. They\ncompared the point at which the adaptation curves\nreached the mean absolute error and found that these\nwere not significantly different.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate if interfer-\nence occurred when the visual displacement and limb\ninvolved changed after every movement in an alter-\nnating fashion. The comparison of unimanual and\nalternating conditions would take place over the full\ntime course of adaptation using performance measures\nindicating both the feedforward and online correction\ncomponents of the movement. We have compared\nalternating conditions with visually opposing and\nvisually consistent prismatic displacements. In addi-\ntion, control conditions would identify whether the\nalternation of the limbs and vision were factors which\ninfluenced adaptation rate. Through these series of\nconditions our aim was to explore in more detail the\nprocess of dual adaptation within an alternating task.\nOf interest was whether we could replicate Bock\net al.\u2019s (2005) results when alternation occurred after\nevery movement. In particular a lack of interference in\nthe alternating condition would suggest that the con-\ntrol systems of the two upper limbs were independent\nof each other throughout the adaptation process.\nMaterials and methods\nParticipants\nSixty healthy subjects (17 males, 43 females) with a\nmean age of 20 (S.D. 3.3 years) took part. They were\nall right-handed and had normal or corrected to nor-\nmal vision. The subjects were recruited from the uni-\nversity community and received course credits to\nparticipate. All subjects provided informed consent.\nRight handedness was assessed using the 10-item ver-\nsion of the Edinburgh inventory (Oldfield 1971). This\nstudy was approved by the school ethics committee and\ntherefore was performed in accordance with ethical\nstandards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Hel-\nsinki.\nMaterials\nSubjects sat as close as possible to a wooden table.\nIn front of each hand was a start button 7 mm in\ndiameter, approximately 10 cm in front of each\nshoulder. Two additional 7 mm targets were positioned\n35 cm away, in the saggital plane. The targets were\n32 cm apart (Fig. 1), each placed centrally on a\n20 cm \u00b7 20 cm response plate.\nThe start and target switches were coupled to gog-\ngles with liquid crystal shutters (PLATO, Translucent\nTechnology, Toronto, Canada). There were two sets of\nExp Brain Res (2006) 175:676\u2013688 677\n123\ngoggles, one set were normal while the other set had\nself-adhesive prismatic Fresnel lenses (3M, Press-on, St\nPaul, MN, USA) attached to each lens. For the alter-\nnating opposing (AO) condition the left lens caused a\nvisual displacement of 11.4\u0002 in an anti-clockwise\ndirection, while the right lens caused a similar dis-\nplacement in a clockwise direction. For the alternating\nconsistent (AC) condition both lenses caused a visual\ndisplacement in a clockwise direction.\nThe movement of the index fingers was sampled\nusing the Polhemus tracking system (Colchester, VT,\nUSA) at a frequency of 60 Hz.\nProcedure\nThe subjects were informed that their main objective\nwas to hit the targets as accurately as possible using\ntheir index fingers. Subjects were randomly allocated\nto one of six groups, which all followed a protocol of\nthree sessions (Table 1). The pre- and post-adaptation\nsessions involved both hands moving simultaneously to\nand from the targets with the subjects only receiving\nvision when pressing the starting position and when\nhitting the target boards but not during the movement.\nThis was to test whether the adaptive states could be\nconcurrently and independently engaged in motor\n   A\n   B\nC\nD\nFig. 1 Experimental set-up of the targets (a), start buttons (b)\nand subjects position. During adaptation, the shutters (d)\nblocked vision through the non-ipsilateral lens (c).

Vision was restricted to endpoint information\nas de-adaptation occurred within the first movement\nwith unrestricted vision.\nThe subjects were told that the movement should be\ncontinuous between the starting buttons and targets,\nand at each end they should press down causing the\nswitches to close. A metronome was used to ensure a\nsimilar movement speed across all subjects and condi-\ntions (1 s per movement) however the participants\nwere reminded to focus on their movement accuracy\nand not speed.\nThe six groups differed in terms of the prism adap-\ntation session that they experienced. The alternating\nadaptation conditions (AO and AC) involved the\nsubject beginning with both fingers pressing down on\nthe start buttons and then either the left or right hand\nmoved to the target situated on that side, whilst the\nother hand remained on the button. For half the sub-\njects their right hand moved first while for the other\nhalf their left hand moved first. The release of the left-\nor right-sided start button resulted in left or right eye\nmonocular vision, respectively during the movement to\nthe target. Once the hand moving had travelled to the\ntarget and back to the starting position, pressing the\nswitch, the other hand could begin its movement. The\nleft and right hand moved in strict alternation. This\nensured each hand only received vision from one eye\nand thus the hands learnt separate visual displace-\nments. The AO condition involved the left hand\nadapting to a counter clockwise displacement and the\nright hand adapting to a clockwise displacement. The\nAC condition involved both the left and right hand\nadapting to a clockwise displacement. Thus the AO\ncondition involved opposing visual displacements and\nthe AC condition involved visually similar displace-\nments.\nThe unimanual adaptation conditions involved\nonly the left or right hand moving, respectively,\nwhilst the other hand remained on the starting but-\nton, thus still only allowing monocular vision via the\nipsilateral lens.\nTwo control conditions were used. Control 1 in-\nvolved an alternating movement of both hands; how-\never only the right hand movement involved\nadaptation to a visual displacement. This was to ensure\nthat if interference did occur between the limbs it was\nas a result of learning to adapt to two visual displace-\nments and not the alternation between the limbs.\nControl 2 involved a unimanual right handed move-\nment however, the subject\u2019s unilateral vision alternated\nafter every movement. This was to ensure that any\nchange in adaptation rate during the alternating con-\nditions was not due to the subjects having to switch\nbetween left eye and right eye, a process which might\nwithdraw computational resources from the adaptation\nprocess.\nAnalysis\nTwo measures of task performance were calculated;\nhand-path direction error at peak tangential hand\nvelocity (angle) and the final position error of the index\nfinger for each pointing movement towards the distal\ntarget (error). We assumed that the angle measurement\nwould represent the pre-planned aspect of the move-\nment, whilst the error measurement would also reflect\nonline correction. Hand-path direction error was cal-\nculated as the angular difference between the starting\nmarker and the point of maximal hand velocity. A\npositive value indicated an initial displacement to the\nright and a negative value to the left of the line joining\nthe starting marker and targets. Final position error\nwas calculated as the horizontal error of the index\nfinger, with relation to the target, as it made contact\nwith the target board.\nFor statistical analysis epochs were created averag-\ning error across three successive movements. There-\nfore, for the pre- and post-adaptation sessions there\nwere 5 epochs, and the prism adaptation session con-\nsisted of 30 epochs (90 movements). The five pre-\nadaptation epochs were averaged to produce a baseline\nerror for each subject. This was the then subtracted\nfrom each of their post-adaptation epochs leaving the\nerror above baseline.\nWithin the analysis comparisons were performed for\nboth measures of task performance. Analysis of vari-\nance with repeated measures (2 hands \u00b7 30 epochs)\nwere used to compare the left and right hand within the\nalternating conditions (AO and AC). These two con-\nditions were then compared separately for the left and\nright hands (2 conditions \u00b7 30 epochs). In order to\nmeasure the performance within these conditions in\ncomparison to unimanual movement, separate ANO-\nVAs compared each hand with the corresponding\nunimanual left or right hand condition (2 condi-\ntions \u00b7 30 epochs). The two control conditions were\ncompared with the unimanual right condition (3 con-\nditions \u00b7 30 epochs). When significant interactions\nwere found between conditions and epochs, indepen-\ndent t-tests were performed on the 1st and 30th epoch\ncomparing the performance between each condition.\nThis aimed to test initial performance error and the\nextent of final adaptation, respectively.\nFinally, for each group, an exponential learning\nmodel was fitted to the average epoch data for the\nprism adaptation session:\nExp Brain Res (2006) 175:676\u2013688 679\n123\nE\u00f0i\u00de \u00bc a0 \u00fe q e\u0001\u00f0i=s\u00de\nIn the model, E is the average group data from\nepoch i relative to the start of the session. a\u00a2 is a scalar\noffset representing a subject\u2019s performance learning\nplateau, q is the gain and s represents the time constant\nof adaptation. A comparison of the left and right hand\nacross conditions were performed by calculating the\nstandard error of the s value. The standard error\nindicated the possible variance of these values.\nResults\nSummary\nFigure 2 shows the final position error (error) for each\ntrial across the three sessions prior to averaging across\nepoch and removing baseline errors in each condition.\nThe pre-adaptation session is characterized by rela-\ntively accurate performance. The prism adaptation\nsession shows an initial large error due to the prismatic\ndisplacement; however over subsequent movements\nadaptation is seen as the error values return back to\nbaseline. Within the post-adaptation session an after-\neffect is seen as an error in the opposite direction to the\ninitial displacement, with this fading over subsequent\ntrials under the return to normal vision.

There was a main effect of epoch\n(F(29, 493) \u2021 7.418, P \u00a3 0.0005) however the main ef-\nfect of condition was not significant. For the left and\nright hand comparisons the interaction between con-\ndition and epoch was significant (F(29, 493) \u2021 1.760,\nP \u00a3 0.009). Independent t-tests were performed on\nepochs 1 and 30. For the left hand no significant dif-\nferences were found however; for the right hand a\nsignificant difference was found at epoch 1 (t = 1.883,\ndf = 18, P \u00a3 0.038). Fig. 5b shows that the right hand\nwithin the AO condition produced a larger initial error\nin comparison to the right hand in the AC condition.\nThe learning models applied (Eq. 1) suggest that the\nleft hand within both conditions produced similar rates\nof adaptation (AO = 0.26, S.E. 0.03, AC = 0.3, S.E.\n0.05) (Fig. 6a). The slightly larger s value produced\nwithin the AC condition may explain the interaction\nfound and implies that the left hand within this con-\ndition adapted slightly faster than in the AO condition.\nFor the right hand the s values were significantly dif-\nferent (AO = 0.3, S.E. 0.03; AC = 0.5, S.E. 0.08).\nFigure 5 shows the more rapid return to asymptotic\nperformance for both the left and right hand in the AC\ncondition, compared to AO.\nControl conditions\nControl 1 involved an alternating movement with\nnormal vision for left arm trials, but a clockwise visual\ndisplacement for right hand trials. The aim was to test\nif the slowed adaptation rate within AO and AC\ncompared to unimanual conditions was due to the\nalternation of the movement or whether interference\nonly occurred during dual adaptation. It was hypothe-\nsized that if the alternation of the two hands was di-\nrectly causing the slowed adaptation rate within the\nalternating conditions then differences would be seen\nbetween control 1 and condition UR. A main effect of\nepoch was found (F(29, 522) = 14.771, P \u00a3 0.0005),\nhowever the main effect of condition and the interac-\ntion between epoch and condition were both non-sig-\nnificant. However the learning models (Eq. 1) applied\nsuggest that within condition UR a faster rate of\nadaptation (s = 1.85, S.E. 0.41) was occurring in com-\nparison to control 1 (s = 1.01, S.E. 0.131).\nThere was also a possibility that the alternation of\nvision from left to right eye during the alternating tasks\nwas a factor in causing the slowed adaptation rate.\nControl 2 involved a unimanual movement with the\nright arm. Subjects had to adapt to a clockwise visual\ndisplacement whilst their monocular vision alternated\nafter every movement.

A main effect of epoch was\nfound (F(29, 522) = 10.883, P \u00a3 0.0005), however the\nmain effect of condition and the interaction between\nepoch and condition were both non-significant. The\nlearning models applied (Eq. 1) suggest that condition\nUR adapted at a faster rate (s = 1.85, S.E. 0.41) in\ncomparison to control 2 (s = 1.21, S.E. 0.181). However,\nFig. 7 shows that for both control conditions this dif-\nference in adaptation rate was not substantial enough to\nproduce any clear separation of the learning curves.\nOpposite eye exposure\nTo ensure these results were not due to a specific re-\nlationship between eye and hand another group were\ntested. This group was tested with the same conditions\nas the AO group; however the opposing eye was used.\nFor example when the right hand moved, vision was\ndisplaced rightwards but using the left eye and vice-\nversa. Five subjects participated in this condition (three\nfemales, two males, mean age 23 \u00b1 9.7). Two mixed\nANOVAs [conditions (2) \u00b7 epochs (30)] were used to\ncompare it with the original AO condition. For both\nthe left and right hands, there were no significant dif-\nferences suggesting the eye used was not important.\nThe s values (left hand\u20140.3 \u00b1 0.098, right\nhand\u20140.34 \u00b1 0.82) were found to be similar to those of\ncondition AO (left hand\u20140.26 \u00b1 0.4, right\nhand\u20140.31 \u00b1 0.034) supporting the claim that there\nwere no significant differences between these condi-\ntions.\nThese results suggest that the slowed adaptation rate\nwithin the alternating conditions (AO and AC) was not\nsolely due to the task involving alternating movement\nand vision. In support of this view the s values (Fig. 6a)\nwithin the alternating conditions were at least 50%\nsmaller in comparison to the values within the two\ncontrol conditions. This suggests that factors other than\nthe specifics of the task were influencing the rate of\nadaptation.\nPost-adaptation\nFor the post-adaptation session one sample t-tests\ncompared the performance of each condition within\nEpoch\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\nEr\nro\nr (\nmm\n)\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\nUR\nControl 1\nControl 2\nUR\nControl 1\nControl 2\nFig. 7 A comparison of the control conditions with condition\nUR.

As the data had\nbeen previously adjusted for baseline performance, this\ntested for a return to this baseline value. For all con-\nditions there was a significant difference between\nepochs 1 and 0 (t = 3.285, df = 9, P \u00a3 0.009). This\nsuggests that when the prismatic displacement was re-\nmoved an aftereffect error in the opposite direction\noccurred. This error is observable for both the angle\nand error data (Figs. 2, 3). The only group which had\nnot returned to baseline performance by epoch 5 was\nthe right hand within condition AC (error data), where\na significant difference was still found (t = 3.290,\ndf = 9, P = 0.009). It is apparent that for all conditions,\nbut in particular the unimanual conditions, the after-\neffect has a greater initial error in comparison to the\ncorresponding initial displacement caused by the\nprisms. An exponential learning model was applied to\nthe average post-adaptation data; however due to the\nlimited number of trials within this session reliable\nparameters could not be fit.\nWithin the unimanual conditions (UL, UR and\ncontrol 2) the pre- and post-adaptation sessions in-\nvolved bimanual movement and so tested for afteref-\nfects in the other hand. T-tests compared epoch 1\nwithin the post-adaptation session with epoch 5 of the\npre-adaptation session. No significant effects were\nfound, suggesting that there were no differences be-\ntween pre- and post-adaptation for the non-adapted\nhand. Thus the non-adapted hands did not show any\nsignificant aftereffects.\nDiscussion\nThe present study aimed to test if the left and right\nhands could independently adapt to prismatic visual\ndisplacements during an alternating pointing task.\nWithin one condition the subjects learnt to adapt to\nvisually opposing (AO) and in another visually con-\nsistent (AC) displacements. These alternating condi-\ntions were compared to unimanual conditions (UL and\nUR). There were two measures of task performance;\nhand-path direction error at peak tangential hand\nvelocity (angle) and the final position error of the index\nfingers for each pointing movement towards the distal\ntarget (error). It was thought that the angle measure-\nment would represent the pre-planned aspect of the\nmovement, whilst the error measurement would also\nreflect online correction.\nBock et al. (2005) found using a performance mea-\nsure similar to the angle parameter, that the two limbs\nwere able to adapt to opposing visual displacements\nconcurrently without negative interference. Our results\nalso show clear evidence of adaptation to the opposing\nvisual displacements within the AO condition. When\nusing the angle movement parameter we found no\nsignificant differences between the two hands in their\ninitial displacement, learning rate or final level of\nadaptation. As opposing aftereffects were also found\nfor both hands, we assume that the two adaptive states\nreflecting changes in sensory-motor translation were\nadopted and thus are indicative of motor learning\n(Bock et al. 2005).\nIn contrast to Bock et al.\u2019s (2005) results we found\nthat within the error data the unimanual conditions\nhave significantly faster adaptation rates in comparison\nto the alternating conditions. This is based on signifi-\ncant interactions between conditions and epochs and\nlarger s values for the unimanual conditions. Hence,\nsubjects in the unimanual conditions reach the plateau\nstage of adaptation in fewer movements. The plateau\nindicates the asymptotic portion of the curve where\nincreasing experience with the visual perturbation no\nlonger leads to substantial improvements in perfor-\nmance (Wang and Sainburg 2004). This suggests that\nduring the alternating task negative interference oc-\ncurred between the limbs resulting in a slowed adap-\ntation rate.\nIt has been shown that if a subject is simultaneously\nexposed to two opposing displacements, convergence\noccurs which is suggestive of neural cross-talk (Craske\nand Crawshaw 1974). The present set-up of alternating\nexposure appears to have allowed the brain to disso-\nciate the two adaptive states. However, the continuous\nshifting of attention from not only one arm to the other\nbut from one displacement to the other could produce\na performance decrement (Jackson et al. 1999). Con-\ntrol 1 involved an alternating movement where only\nthe right limb was exposed to a visual displacement. It\nwas hypothesized that if the alternation of the move-\nment was causing the slowed adaptation rate then the\nright hand performance would show significant differ-\nences to the right hand within the unimanual condition\n(UR). The s values suggest that the alternation did\nindeed result in a slower adaptation rate. However, as\nthese reduced s values were still at least double the\nvalues found within the alternating conditions (AO\nand AC), and as no significant interaction was found\n[Condition (control 1 vs UR) vs Epoch] it implies that\nthe continuous shifting from one limb to another was\nnot a pivotal factor in causing the observed interfer-\nence.\nThe unimanual and alternating conditions not only\ndiffered by the numbers of arms used but also by the\nnumber of eyes used. Control 2 involved a unimanual\nmovement where unilateral vision alternated after\nExp Brain Res (2006) 175:676\u2013688 685\n123\nevery movement. It was hypothesized that if the\nslowing of the adaptation rate was due to the subjects\nhaving to switch between left and right eye vision then\na significant difference would be found between this\nand the unimanual right (UR) condition. The s values\nagain suggest that the alternation of vision does influ-\nence the adaptation rate. However, the lack of an\ninteraction between conditions and epochs and the\nsubstantially larger s values in comparison to the\nalternating conditions indicate that even though com-\nputational resources may have been partially engaged\nin dealing with the alternating vision this alone fails to\nexplain the larger reduction in adaptation rate occur-\nring in the alternating conditions.\nThe inconsistent results from the angle and error\ndata suggest that interference did not occur during the\nfeedforward aspect of movement. As the differences\nbetween alternating and unimanual conditions were\nonly in the error data, we propose that interference\nbetween the limbs occurred within the online correc-\ntion stage of movement. Note that with one exception\nthe adaptation rates for the error data are lower than\nthose for the angle data suggesting that negative\ninterference affected online correction but not feed-\nforward commands. Servos and Goodale (1994) be-\nlieve visual information stored in extrinsic coordinates\nis essential for the online control of visually guided\nmovements. The prismatic displacement involved in\nthe present task directly affects this component of\nonline correction. If it is accepted that the limbs are\ncontrolled independently (Bock et al. 2005) it is\ntherefore pivotal that the displacements are dissociated\nin order for each limb to adapt to the respective dis-\nplacement and thus be able to use vision accurately\nduring online correction. Interference and a slowed\nadaptation rate may occur as a result of this require-\nment to dissociate the visual information from the\nalternating displacements. Control 2 indicates that this\ndissociation is not coupled with the alternation of vi-\nsion; this dissociation seems only relevant during an\nalternating task involving two limbs. As this interfer-\nence also occurred within the AC condition, it implies\nthat it may be an implicit consequence of using the left\nand right limb independently. It is already known that\nthis dissociation does not occur during unimanual\nmovement where external contextual cues are required\nto learn opposing adaptive states (Osu et al. 2004;\nWada et al. 2003).\nThe slowed adaptation rate was found to occur\nwithin both alternating conditions. However there does\nseem to be a grading effect where a greater amount of\ninterference occurred within the AO condition than in\nthe AC condition. This view is based on the significant\ninteractions found between conditions (AO vs AC)\nand epochs, the significant difference between the\nconditions at epoch 1 for the right hand, and the larger\ns value for the right hand within condition AC. These\nresults suggest that for the right hand in particular a\nsmaller amount of negative interference occurred\nwithin the AC condition. Bays et al. (2005) suggest that\nthe ability to retain motor memories for different tasks\ndepends on the degree to which their representations\nconflict in working memory. We propose that the AC\ncondition involved a smaller amount of interference.\nAs the interference was seen within online correction,\nthe conflict may be the perceived distance between the\ntargets. For the AC condition the prismatic displace-\nments would have not changed this distance; however\nwithin the AO condition the perceived distance would\nhave increased from 32 to 46 cm as a result of the 11.4\u0002\nopposing displacements. If interference between tasks\nis due to the degree to which their representations\nconflict (Bays et al. 2005; Bock 2003) and if visual\ninformation stored in extrinsic coordinates is essential\nfor the online control of visually guided movements\n(Servos and Goodale 1994) then this increased distance\nbetween the targets may result in the greater interfer-\nence seen within the AO condition.\nBock et al. (2005) suggest that the interaction be-\ntween the adaptive states during the alternating tasks is\nfunctional, with the use of a given arm acting as a cue\nto switch between two available states. If a single\nadaptive area of the brain is used for both hands, this\nwould have to functionally adjust in order to prevent\ninterference. Within unimanual literature there is a\ndispute as to whether two opposing environments can\nbe learnt by one limb if they are randomly or contin-\nually changing. Karniel and Mussa-Ivaldi (2002)\nexposed subjects to two alternating dynamic force-\nfields and found even after 4 days of learning that they\nwere unable to form two independent internal models.\nThey concluded that the central nervous system em-\nployed a single internal model when dealing with a\nsequence of perturbations. In contrast Osu et al. (2004)\nand Wada et al. (2003) have shown that if the two\nforce-fields are paired with contextual cues the for-\nmation of two internal models can take place. How-\never, this learning is significantly slowed in comparison\nto learning to adapt to one force-field. Wada et al.\n(2003) conclude that the key determinants of multiple\ninternal model learning are the relative efficiency of\ncontextual information and the similarity of the two\nenvironments. With regard to the current experiment it\nseems likely that using separate limbs was a very effi-\ncient cue in selecting the correct feedforward move-\nment command. This is shown by there being no\n686 Exp Brain Res (2006) 175:676\u2013688\n123\nsignificant differences between the alternating and\nunimanual conditions within the angle data which is\nthought to represent the feedforward component of the\ntask.\nWe observed negative aftereffects within the post-\nadaptation session. Bimanual coupling is characterized\nby two independent movements converging (Franz and\nRamachandran 1998). The two hands produced smaller\naftereffects in AO compared to the unimanual condi-\ntions, suggesting they converged as a result of the two\nhands moving simultaneously. The AC condition pro-\nduced slightly larger aftereffects than the unimanual\nconditions. This can also be explained through\nbimanual coupling as the two limbs moved in the same\nanti-clockwise direction forcing each limb further in\nthat direction.\nAn interesting finding is that generally all the\naftereffects had greater initial amplitude, in com-\nparison to the error caused by the onset of dis-\nplacement. This is surprising as they are presumably\nmanifestations of a single underlying change (Harris\n1965). However, this may be simply due to the post-\nadaptation session only involving vision of the\nmovement end point and therefore not having any\nonline feedback. This would cause the error to be\nlarger in comparison to full vision as in the prism\nadaptation session. Note that the average error in the\nbaseline condition, with terminal feedback, was lar-\nger than the final error in the adaptation session,\nthus supporting this suggestion. Finally, the pre- and\npost-adaptation sessions involved simultaneous hand\nmovement in all groups, whereas the adaptation\nsession involved either unimanual or alternating ac-\ntion. This also may contribute to the difference in\nadaptation and aftereffect errors.\nAs the post-adaptation session always involved a\nbimanual movement, bimanual coupling could have\nresulted in a bimanual aftereffect following the uni-\nmanual conditions. However, for the non-adapted\nhands there were no significant differences between the\npre- and post-adaptation error values within both\nunimanual conditions. This suggests that adaptation of\none hand to the visual displacement did not interfere\nwith the subsequent performance of the non-adapted\nhand and that bimanual coupling was specific to the\nalternating conditions. This specificity suggests that the\ncoupling seen in the alternating condition is engaged\nby the adaptation process; if only one hand is adapted,\nthe plastic process is constrained to affect only that\nhand.\nIn summary this present paper supports the view\nthat two adaptive states can be learnt concurrently\nduring an alternating bimanual task. The slowed\nadaptation rate within the alternating conditions is\nbelieved to be due to negative interference between\nthe two limb controllers during online correction. Two\ncontrol conditions suggest that the intermittent nature\nof the task and the alternation between the left and\nright eye are factors which influence the adaptation\nrate but do not fully explain the negative interference.\nIt seems likely that during alternate movement, use of\neach limb provides contextual cues to switch between\nthe relevant internal models. We propose that the\nnegative interference may result from the requirement\nto dissociate the visual information needed for online\ncorrection of each limb.\nReferences\nBays PM, Flanagan JR, Wolpert DM (2005) Interference be-\ntween velocity-dependent and position-dependent force-\nfields indicates that tasks depending on different kinematic\nparameters compete for motor working memory.
