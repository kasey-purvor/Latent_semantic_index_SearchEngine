It \nis concluded that the AE technique offers a complementary tool for rail track defect \ndetection.  \n \nKeywords: Acoustic Emission, condition monitoring, rail track diagnosis. \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n1 RAIL TRACK DEFECTS \n \nThe phenomenon of wear and cracks in rail track due to rolling contact fatigue is not \nfully understood. Different defects types appear in rail tracks and there are various \nmechanisms responsible for this such as corrosion, rolling contact fatigue, creep and \nwear, with rolling contact fatigue and wear constituting the two most prominent. The \nrolling contact fatigue of rails manifest as headchecks, torgue lipping, squats, false \nflange damage, wheel burns and spalling [2]. The stages of initiation and growth are \nwidely detailed. \n \nIt has been showed [2] that ultrasound can be used to detect cracks in rails. Ultrasonic \ninspection of rails requires use of several probes in order to increase the probability of \ndetecting cracks. For reasons of geometry ultrasound is not suitable for detecting defects \nin the gauge corner [2,3]. Krull et al [3] showed that the eddy current technique was \nsuitable to detection of fine cracks on the surface of the rail.   Whilst techniques such as \nultrasound and eddy current testing can be employed for crack detection on rail-tracks, \nseveral defects have clearly been missed. \n \n2 ACOUSTIC EMISSION IN RAIL TRACK \n \nMeasurement of high frequency Acoustic Emissions (AE) has become a viable \ntechnique in the condition monitoring of many types of rotating machinery [4-9]. On \nreal operational machinery, it is often only practical to take AE measurements from \nnon-rotating members, at or on the bearing housing. Consequently, AE signals \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \noriginating from any component other than the bearing will incur significant attenuation \nto an AE receiving sensor attached on the bearing housing. However, recent attempts \n[4] at locating the AE receiving sensor on rotating parts have been encouraging.  \n \nAcoustic emission is a naturally occurring phenomenon within materials and is defined \nas the resulting transient elastic wave generated when strain energy is released suddenly \nwithin or on the surface of a material. This is due to microstructure changes such as, \ndislocations, crack generation and propagation, friction phenomena within a crack, \nplastic deformation, fracture of brittle inclusions, fibre breakage, etc. These changes can \nbe generated internally or externally and cover a broad frequency range between 20 kHz \nto 1MHz. An added advantage of using the AE technique is that it is independent of \nrotational velocities. \n \nAcoustic emissions as described in this paper refer to elastic surface waves generated \nentirely by the rubbing\/frictional of mating components. The formation, deformation, \nand fracture of surface irregularities or asperities, which is associated with friction of \nmetals [10], will result in the generation of AE. Publications on the application of AE to \nrail-track defect detection are non-existent at present and this paper provides a \nfundamental assessment of its application to rail-track defect detection. In light of the \nrecent, and past, accidents in the rail industry, the assessment of the mechanical \nintegrity of rail track is of vital importance. AE is widely used for crack detection in \nstatic structures and Bassim et al [11] showed that crack initiation and progression in \nrail steel specimens exposed to bending can be detected using the AE technique.  \n \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nStudies in the application of AE to tribology are relevant to the current investigation on \nrubbing faces of the wheel and track. Researchers [12,13] have investigated wear \nbetween loaded metal surfaces in relative motion, with or without lubrication, and \nconcluded that AE can be used to determine the onset and the rate of wear between \ncomponents. The source of AE activity was attributed to the breaking of surface \nasperities and the formation and destruction of the friction contact. Sarychev [12] \nobserved that the strength of AE depended on; sliding velocity, friction coefficient of \nmating surfaces, contact pressure and the height of surface roughness, while Lingard \n[13] noted that AE was attributed to frictional forces rather than wear. It may be \nconcluded that the process of wear between contact faces of the wheel and rail-track, \nand propagation of cracks within the track, will generate AE activity. \n \n3 TEST RIG \n \nA schematic diagram of the test-rig is illustrated in figure 1 and shown in figure 2. The \ntest-rig consisted of two wheels, a rail track wheel and a rail wheel, both scaled down \nreplicas of standard rail\/wheel profiles (ratio 3:1). The material employed was mild \ncarbon steel and the surface finish of the wheel and rail was approximately 3\u03bcm. No \nsurface hardening was employed to allow for accelerated wear, particularly as the initial \nthrust of this investigation was to ascertain the applicability of AE to surface defect \ndetection.  A three-phase electrical motor (1 kW) with a variable speed mechanical \ngearbox was employed to drive the test-rig. A belt from the gearbox was connected to a \ndriving rubber wheel (part 9 of figure 1) onto which the rail-track wheel rested. The rail \ntrack wheel was rotated solely by frictional contact between the rubber wheel and the \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nrail-track wheel. The rail track wheel in turn rotated the rail wheel also by frictional \ncontact. A simple hydraulic mechanism that permitted loading between the rail wheel \nand track was employed. This was a Parker HC 20T cylinder that provided up to 3000 \nN. \n \nThe main reason for designing the rail and track wheels at 900 to each other was to \nsimulate the best condition conducive for the generation of surface defects, particularly \nas wear is more prevalent on curved tracks [1]. However, at the time of designing the \ntest-rig due consideration was not given to the effect of sliding between the rail \nwheel\/track interface on audible noise generation. In addition, during experimental \nsimulations that required loading between the wheel and the rail further limitations of \nthe test-rig became apparent. As the speed of rotation and load on the rail wheel was \nincreased to 460rpm (25km\/hr) and 1800N respectively, the noise levels reached values \nin excess of 95dB. At these test conditions the loss of signal transmission between the \nAE receiving sensor and the acquisition system was experienced. This was attributed to \nthe high amplitude levels of the low frequency carrier (modulating the high frequency \nAE signature) thereby saturating the band-pass filter on the pre-amplifier (see section on \ndata acquisition system and discussion). As a consequence of the above the maximum \nload and speed tested were 1800N at 200rpm (10.5km\/hr). Whilst this was a clear \nlimitation, it was not thought detrimental to establishing fundamentally if AE could be \napplied to rail-track diagnosis. Design alterations are currently in process to allow for \ntest simulations to be achieved at speeds of up to 50Km\/hr. This is being accomplished \nby changing the orientation of the rail track wheel such that both wheels, rail and track, \nare vertical. Furthermore, alternative methods of transferring the AE signature from the \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nreceiving sensor to the acquisition system are currently being explored, as are \ninvestigations on limitations of current AE sensors. \n  \n       1                 2                3                              4                      5                 6 \n \n                             7                 8                           9                 \nThe numbers represents the following components: \n \n1.

The sensor was placed on rail wheel and was secured with a mechanical \nclamp, see figure 3. The cable connecting the sensor placed on the wheel with the pre-\namplifier was feed into the shaft and connected to a slip rig, see figure 3. This \narrangement allowed the AE sensor to be placed as close as possible to the rail wheel. A \nPH-12 slip rig manufactured by \u2018IDM Electronics Ltd\u2019 was employed. The output signal \nfrom the AE sensors was pre-amplified to 40dB. The pre-amplifier had a built-in band-\npass filter ranging from 100KHz to 1,000KHz. The signal output from the pre-amplifier \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nwas connected (i.e. via BNC\/coaxial cable) directly to a commercial data acquisition \ncard where a sampling rate of between 2MHz to 4MHz was used during the tests. A \nhand held optical tachometer was used to measure the rotational speed of the rail wheel. \n \n \n \nFigure 3 Location of sensors on test-rig \n \n6 ATTENUATION TEST \n \nPrior to undertaking any simulations it was thought prudent to ascertain if Acoustic \nEmissions could be transmitted across the wheel\/rail interface. The test undertaken in \nthis investigation involved pressing lead (0.5mm 2H) obliquely against the surface of \nthe wheel and rail-track until fracture. This test is widely known as the Nielson source \ntest and was employed due to its simplicity and repeatability in generating a broadband \nAE sensor \nSlip ring \nOptical \ntrigger \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nAE signal [14]. It is noted that the release of strain energy within such lead breaks is \ncaused by the sudden recoil of the compressed atoms upon the surface of the metal \nwhen the pencil snaps and does not originate within the lead itself. Between five to \nseven tests were undertaken at each location (load approximately 100N) and the exact \nlocation of the lead breaks is highlighted in figure 4 whilst results are presented in table \n1. The results presented are relative attenuation values with reference to a lead break \nnext to the sensor (P1). \n                      P5                        P4                   P3             P2                           P1 \n \n                                            \nFigure 4   Location of attenuation tests ( P \u2013 position) \n \n \n \n \n \nSeeded \nsurface \ndefect \nSensor \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nAttenuation \/ Position P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 \nMax.

This was a clear indication of the \ntransmissibility of the AE generated on the track across the rail\/wheel interface. \n \n7 TEST PROCEDURE \n \nThe rig was run-in for approximately three hours before the actual experiments were \ncarried out. This was undertaken at a rail wheel speed of approximately 50 rpm and a \ncorresponding load of 300 N. The primary purpose of running-in was to smooth out the \nsurface finish of the wheel and track.  \n \nThe test simulations started with no-defect condition to obtain background noise \nconditions. Tests were undertaken at three rotational speeds; 50, 100 and 200rpm, \ncorresponding to 2, 5, and 10 Km\/hr respectively. Furthermore, four load conditions \nwere simulated; 0, 300, 900 and 1800 N. Following the background noise tests a \nsimulated fault condition of a surface defect was introduced to the rail track, see figures \n4 and 5. This was accomplished with an engraving machine. To ensure that AE \nsignatures were directly associated with the passage of the rail wheel over the defective \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nrail track an optical trigger was employed, see figure 3. Identical speed and load \nconditions were undertaken as with the defect free condition. The seeded surface defect \nwas located on the edge of the track wheel, where the rail wheel was in contact with the \ntrack wheel. The edge of the track wheel is similar to the gauge corner of a rail track. \nThe length of the surface defect was approximately 5 mm, the depth approximately 1 \nmm and the width approximately 2 mm, see figure 5. \n \n \n \nFigure 5 Photograph of seeded defect \n \nAn artificial defect of this type is known to produce AE activity and is considered to be \nrepresentative of a surface discontinuity, such as a surface crack. It was not intended to \ninitiate crack propagation from the seeded defect but rather assess the applicability of \nAE from a position of assumed maturity of a surface crack\/discontinuity. Whilst it could \nbe argued that this is not entirely representative, the reader is reminded that at this stage \nthis is a fundamental study. \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n8 DEFECT SIMULATIONS AND OPERATIONAL NOISE \n \nAcoustic Emission signatures associated with five different speeds at 0N is shown in \nfigure 6. Due to the limitations detailed earlier speeds of 350rpm and 450rpm (19 and \n25Km\/hr) were not investigated at higher loads. It must be noted that the 0N load \nspecification was not literally \u2018zero\u2019 as some preload (approximately 10N) was required \nto maintain frictional contact. Clearly AE activity increased (observe the different scales \non the y-axis of figure 6) with increasing speed at this load condition. At speeds of 50 \nand 100rpm, no AE activity was noted. The AE signatures associated with these \nconditions and displayed in figure 6 are signatures of system electronic noise only. \nThese observations of increased AE activity with speed for a load condition reinforce \nthe findings of Sarychev [12]. \n \nTypical AE signatures from defect and defect free conditions are shown in figures 7 and \n8. In all cases four load conditions are presented with 0 N at the top of each figure and \n1800 N at the bottom. Three speed conditions were investigated, 50, 100 and 200 rpm. \n \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \nFigure 6    Background AE activity for  five speeds under no load condition \n(a) 50rpm (b) 100rpm (c) 200rpm (d) 350 rpm (e) 460 rpm \n \n \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n(a) \n(d) \n(c) \n(b) \n \nFigure 7    Background AE activity for four load conditions; no seeded defect \nSpeed:  100 rpm (6 Km\/hr); Load  (a) 0N  (b) 300N  (c) 900N  (d) 1800N \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.01\n0\n0.01\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\nVo\nlts\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(a) \n \nFigure 8    Defect AE activity for four load conditions with seeded defect \nSpeed:  100 rpm (6 Km\/hr); Load  (a) 0N  (b) 300N  (c) 900N  (d) 1800N \n \nIt was hoped that the seeded surface discontinuity would result in AE activity, however, \nthe natural wear process of the test specimen could not be controlled. This was \nprimarily due to the fact that the surfaces of the wheel and rail had not been hardened. A \nconsequence of this was the inability to differentiate between AE generated from the \nseeded defect to that from natural wear. The AE signatures presented in figure 8 cover a \ntime window of 0 to 0.064 seconds that includes the rail wheel passing over the defect \non the track. Irrespective of this, observations of progressive wear on the rail \ntrack\/wheel interface were associated with increasing AE transient bursts. This \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \nobservation was noted during simulations. At the start of the test, the surface of the  \nrail\/track interface did not how any visible signs of wear. However, as the test \nsimulations progressed, signs of wear on the interface became apparent, as did the rate \nof AE burst activity, see figures 11 and 12. \n \nA frequency spectrum of a typical AE transient burst at the start of the tests is \nhighlighted in figure 9 whilst a spectrum of an AE burst signature for the same test \ncondition recorded a few hours later is displayed in figure 10. \n0 0.002 0.004 0.006 0.008 0.01 0.012 0.014 0.016 0.018 0.02\n-0.04\n-0.02\n0\n0.02\n0.04\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nFrequency (MHz)\nm\nV\n \nFigure 9   Frequency spectrum of AE signature associated with background noise; \nspeed 200rpm, load 1800N \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n0 0.005 0.01 0.015 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035\n-0.1\n-0.05\n0\n0.05\n0.1\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n0\n0.5\n1\nFrequency (MHz)\nm\nV\n \nFigure 10    Frequency spectrum of AE burst associated with increased wear on the \nrail track; speed 200rpm, load 1800N  \n \n9 DISCUSSIONS \n \nFrom the simulated conditions it was observed that AE transient burst activity increased \nwith progressive wear, however, the author\u2019s attempts to relate the rate of this activity \nwith load and speed could not be ascertained. Whilst early observations showed AE \nburst activity and underlying levels to increase with speed, this phenomenon did not \nhold true as the wear progressed. This unpredictable relationship was noted by Lingard \net al [13] where a correlation between wear and AE activity for varying speeds and \nloads was not discernible. Associating specific AE transient burst to the simulated \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \ndefect was not possible for the reasons already detailed. It must be noted that the \ninvestigation centered on mild steel which is not typical of the rail head, as such the \ndirect relevance of these results to actual operational conditions can only be postulated \nat present. \n \nFrom the results it was observed that AE activity under background noise conditions \nwas only detectable when the load was above 900 N for all speeds. These observations \nwere made at the start of the experiment. However, after the defect was seeded AE \nactivity was detectable at loads above 300 N for all speed conditions. More importantly, \nthe rate of AE activity as the rail wheel passed the defective rail track was significantly \ngreater than the defect free condition, see figure 7 and 8. This was clearly due to the \nprogressive wear of the contact region and not due to the presence of the defect, see \nfigures 11 and 12. It is interesting to note that the frequency content of AE bursts at the \nstart of the tests and a few hours later were identical, see figures 9 and 10. This is not \nsurprising and confirms the view that the AE transients were generated from the same \nmechanism, frictional contact. \n \n \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n \n \nFigure 11    Evidence of wear on the circumferential periphery of rail track wheel \n \n \n \n \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n \n \nFigure 12    Evidence of wear on the rail wheel \n \nWhilst the initial objective of identifying a surface defect was not successfully \naccomplished observations of AE activity with progressive wear from the rail \nwheel\/track interface have been encouraging. The test-rig design and transmission \nbreak-up of the AE signature see figures 14 and 15, limited the test conditions which \ncould have been carried out. This breakage was noted at speeds above 200rpm and loads \nof 300N. As a direct result of this draw back a new means of transferring AE data from \na rotating sensor are been investigated with a prototype under design.  \n \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06\n-0.025\n-0.02\n-0.015\n-0.01\n-0.005\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\n0.02\n0.025\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n \nFigure 13   Break-up of AE signature \n0.042 0.043 0.044 0.045 0.046 0.047 0.048 0.049\n-0.015\n-0.01\n-0.005\n0\n0.005\n0.01\n0.015\nTime (seconds)\nVo\nlts\n \nFigure 14    Zoom of figure 13 \nElectronic \nnoise levels \nNDT and E International, 37 (7), pp. 507-516, 2004 \n  \n \n11   Conclusion \n \nIt has been shown that the AE sensor, positioned on the side of the rail wheel, was able \nto pick up AE activity from the rail track. The AE activity was attributed to the \nprogressive wear of the rail wheel\/track frictional process. As wear progressed the rate \nof AE burst activity increased. This paper has demonstrated the potential of applying \nAE to rail track defect detection. The research programme reported is in its infancy but \nthe results to date are encouraging.  \n \n12 REFERENCES \n \n1.
