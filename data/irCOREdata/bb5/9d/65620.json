In the North Atlantic, by circa C.E. 800\u2013C.E. 850,\nsettlers colonized the islands of the eastern North Atlantic\n(Shetland, Orkney, Hebrides, Man, Ireland, and Faroes). Ice-\nland was traditionally settled circa 874, Greenland circa\n985, and the short-lived Vinland colony survived for a few\nyears around C.E. 1000 in Newfoundland\u2013Gulf of St. Lau-\nrence region (Arneborg 2000; Wallace 2000). Around the\nyear C.E. 1000, Nordic language and culture extended from\nthe coast of North America to the Baltic, and by C.E. 1014\nan Anglo-Scandinavian dynasty briefly united England,\nDenmark, and Norway. However, this first connection of\nold and new worlds proved transient. By the mid\u201311th cen-\ntury the Vinland colony was abandoned, and by the mid\u2013\n15th century the Greenlandic colony became completely\nextinct. Iceland survived as the westernmost outpost of the\nViking Age North Atlantic expansion, and the first transat-\nlantic connection between the Old and New Worlds ended\nin failure. Changes in politics and market forces in Europe\nplayed a role in the unhappy end to the \u201cNorse Atlantic\nAMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, Vol. 109, Issue 1, pp. 27\u201351, ISSN 0002-7294 online ISSN 1548-1433.

Since the mid\u2013\n1970s research focus has shifted, as multiple projects com-\nbining archaeology, paleoecology, and history have been\ncarried out all across the region, producing a richer un-\nderstanding of the Norse migrations and placing them\nmore effectively in an environmental and economic con-\ntext (Arneborg and Gr\u00f8nnow 2005; Bigelow 1991; Housley\nand Coles 2004; McGovern 1990, 2004; Morris and\nRackham 1992; Ogilvie and McGovern 2000). The histor-\nical ecology movement (Balee\u00b4 1998; Crumley 1994, 1998,\n2001; Kirch and Hunt 1997) has come to provide the theo-\nretical underpinning of much North Atlantic archaeological\nresearch, a pattern shared by many other regions where ar-\nchaeology and paleoecology are attempting to connect the\nlong-term record of human\u2013environment interaction with\npresent issues of rapid environmental change and human\n28 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nresponse (Hardesty and Fowler 2001). The movement at-\ntempts to combine the interdisciplinary environmental ori-\nentation of the best of the processual archaeology of the\n1980s with the concern for contextual history, factional\nconflict, and politically loaded cultural landscape construc-\ntion stressed by some postprocessualists in the 1990s\u2014with\na clear agenda aimed at integrating archaeology and envi-\nronmental history within global change research (Amorosi\net al. 1996; Bawden and Reycraft 2001; Descola and Pa\u00b4lsson\n1996; Kirch 1997; McGovern 1994; Redman 1999; Spriggs\n1997; Steadman 1995).\nThe dramatic value of the diverse cases provided by the\nNorse North Atlantic (initial spread of a homogeneous pop-\nulation into different island ecosystems, subsequent eco-\nnomic and social diversification, and total extinction of the\nVinland and Greenland colonies) has increasingly featured\nin works aimed at a broad audience interested in global\nchange topics (Diamond 2005; McGovern and Perdikaris\n2000; Pringle 1997; Redman 1999). In the past decade,\nthe North Atlantic has thus become an arena for just the\nsort of international, interdisciplinary research into long-\nterm, human\u2013environmental interactions that most fund-\ning agencies identify as worthy of global change support.\nThis development is itself in part an outcome of early global\nchange funding to archaeology and paleoecology by the\nU.S. National Science Foundation\u2019s Office of Polar Programs\n(NSF OPP).\nThe regional research cooperative North Atlantic\nBiocultural Organization ([NABO], see www.geo.ed.ac.uk\/\nnabo) was formally set up at an NSF supported workshop\n1992, but it initially grew out of a meeting in 1988 at\nBowdoin College hosted by Gerry Bigelow and Susan Ka-\nplan of the Peary-Macmillan Arctic Center (Bigelow 1991).\nSince 1993, NABO has provided support for field projects\nin Iceland, Greenland, Northern Norway, Scotland, and the\nFaroe Islands. The group has contributed to Northern ed-\nucation by sponsoring doctoral, Master of arts, and Mas-\nter of science theses in anthropology, geology, and geog-\nraphy in the United States, United Kingdom, and Scan-\ndinavia, and since 1997 has cosponsored (with City Uni-\nversity of New York [CUNY], the Icelandic Institute of\nArchaeology, University of Oslo, and University of Glas-\ngow) an international multidisciplinary field school in Ice-\nland that has involved students from 26 nations. Since\n2000, a special NSF OPP Research Experience for Under-\ngraduates grant to Sophia Perdikaris of Brooklyn College,\nCUNY, has integrated classroom, laboratory, and real-time\ndistance learning, with Icelandic fieldwork, dramatically\nchanging the lives of highly motivated inner-city under-\ngrads and producing a series of student-authored papers and\nposters (Amundsen et al. 2005; Krivogorskaya et al. 2005).\nNABO has also provided practical logistic support (three\njointly purchased and maintained Land Rovers, jointly\npurchased resistivity instruments, electronic distance me-\nters [EDMs], and GPS receivers, and prepositioned stocks\nof basic field gear, tents, and provisions), has provided\nenhanced data comparability through community devel-\noped data management software (NABONE), and has held\na suite of 22 workshops and conferences since 1992 that\nhave helped forge individual and institutional connections\nand produced major conference publications (Arneborg\nand Gr\u00f8nnow 2005; Bigelow 1991; Housley and Coles\n2004; Morris and Rackham 1992; Ogilvie and Jo\u00b4nsson\n2001). NABO interdisciplinary efforts produced the first\nuse in archaeology and history of high-resolution proxy\nclimate data from the Greenland ice-core projects (Bar-\nlow et al. 1997; Buckland et al. 1996; Dugmore et al.\nforthcoming), and NABO meetings now regularly include\nrepresentatives of the hard sciences and environmental\nplanners, as well as the usual crowd of historians, archae-\nologists, and paleoecologists. NABO teams have also been\nsuccessful in leveraging the initial NSF support to a cur-\nrent total of just over US$3.5 million in external fund-\ning from North American, Scandinavian, and United King-\ndom sources. NABO participants have gotten by with help\nfrom their friends and neighbors and have been able to\ntake on projects and address problems beyond the capa-\nbility of any single scholar, university, or national research\nprogram.\nCASE STUDY: EARLY SETTLEMENT IN NORTH ICELAND\nAlthough one objective of this article is to indicate the\ngeneral benefits (scholarly and financial) of sustained, ac-\ntive, and coordinated interdisciplinary international co-\noperation, the only real justification for involvement in\nthe acronym-rich world of Global Change research is\nthe improvement of our collective contribution through\ncase-specific, problem-focused field and laboratory research\nprojects. The remainder of this article turns to a presenta-\ntion of the results of one of the largest and longest-lasting\ncooperative NABO projects: the \u201cLandscapes of Settlement\nin NE Iceland\u201d project (1996 to present) in the inland\nMy\u00b4vatn district (My\u00b4vatnssveit).\nIceland is a volcanic island situated atop the North\nAtlantic ridge. It is subject to frequent volcanic erup-\ntions, many of which provide a widespread fallout of vol-\ncanic ash (tephra). Where identified, these tephra layers\ndefine isochronous marker horizons that can be traced\nthrough sediment, soil profiles, and archaeological deposits\n(Dugmore et al. 2004; Tho\u00b4rarinsson 1944, 1961, 1981).\nSouthern Iceland is warmed by the North Atlantic drift\nand is classed as a boreal environment (with little persis-\ntent snow in lower elevations). Northern Iceland is signif-\nicantly colder (low arctic, substantial long-lasting winter\nsnow), and the interior highlands are today covered by large\nglaciers and heavily eroded arctic deserts.\nAccounts of early settlement by Celtic Christian monks\nare still unproven by archaeology (but see Ahronson 2000),\nand archaeological evidence strongly indicates the first ef-\nfective settlement of the island by humans occurred in the\nlate ninth century C.E. (conveniently associated with the\n\u201cLandna\u00b4m\u201d tephra layer now dated C.E. 871 \u00b12 by cor-\nrelation to the Greenland Ice Sheet; see Gro\u00a8nvold et al.\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 29\n1995). When Scandinavian settlers arrived, they encoun-\ntered a mid\u2013Atlantic island with substantial arctic birch for-\nest in the lower elevations, coastal sea mammal (includ-\ning walrus) and sea bird colonies, migratory nesting birds,\nand the green grass that could feed their imported do-\nmestic livestock. The economy of the Viking Age North\nAtlantic settlers was flexible but based around stock raising\nsupplemented by limited barley growing and often exten-\nsive use of wild species (Dugmore et al. 2005; McGovern\net al. 2001; McGovern et al. 2006; Simpson et al. 2002).\nPasture was the ultimate source of wealth and power, and\nthe correlation of cattle, good grazing, and chieftainship\nis clear in both the historical and archaeological record\n(McGovern 2000; Ve\u00b4steinsson 1998). Between the initial\nsettlement (Landna\u00b4m), traditionally dated circa C.E. 874,\nand political union with Norway in 1262, Icelandic society\nwas dominated by chieftains and great families but con-\nstrained by codified laws and an elaborate system of tradi-\ntional justice (Sigur sson 1999; Ve\u00b4steinsson 2000a, 2000b,\n2001). Although today Iceland is an independent, vibrant,\nrapidly urbanizing modern Scandinavian nation of around\n300,000, during the 15th\u201318th centuries Iceland was a rel-\natively impoverished rural province in the kingdom of\nNorway\u2013Denmark with a population fluctuating around\n50,000.\nLike many of the islands of Oceania and the Caribbean,\nIceland thus represents an environment with a clear and\nrelatively recent prehuman\u2013human baseline, but Iceland\nwould also become a fully literate island community whose\nnatives were to produce some of the most important histo-\nries of early medieval Scandinavia and self-consciously anti-\nquarian records of pre-Christian pagan mythology. Iceland\nalso has a long modern tradition of scholarship in both the\nnatural and social sciences, particularly in history, anthro-\npology, and the earth sciences. Icelandic medieval litera-\nture (sagas, hagiographies, histories, annals, law codes, etc.)\nprovides a rich record of later landholding patterns, legal\npractice, stock raising, demography, conflict and competi-\ntion, and invaluable access to an internal world view and\nemic social and economic categories that have been heavily\nexploited by anthropologists and social historians (Byock\n2001; Durrenberger 1989, 1992; Eggertsson 1998; Hastrup\n1985, 1990; Ingimundarson and Ogilvie 1998; Miller 1990;\nOgilvie 1997; Vasey 1991, 1996; Ve\u00b4steinsson 2000b). Partic-\nularly useful for economic history and settlement pattern\nanalysis is a comprehensive land and stock register com-\npiled in 1703\u201312 (Jar bo\u00b4k A\u00b4rna Magnusso\u00b4nar 1990), which\nstill exists for most of Iceland and has been recently con-\nverted to digital format (Edvardsson 2001). The Jar abo\u00b4k\nentries provide farm-by-farm details of early-18th-century\nstock raising and wild resource use; furthermore, they re-\ntain some elements of medieval land valuation systems\n(Fri riksson 2004a). However, until the 12th century, none\nof the medieval written sources are contemporary with the\nevents they describe, and they are problematic sources for\nthe reconstruction of economy and society at Landna\u00b4m.\nThe first two centuries of Icelandic archaeology are effec-\ntively prehistoric and can only be directly investigated by\narchaeology and paleoecology (Ve\u00b4steinsson 1998, 2000a).\nRESEARCH PROBLEM: UNINTENDED HUMAN IMPACT\nON ISLAND ECOSYSTEMS\nIceland has long been famous both for its rich medieval lit-\nerature and for an extreme human impact on vegetation,\nsoils, and landscapes since its settlement in the ninth cen-\ntury C.E. While Icelanders were composing the prose and\npoetry that still comprise major sources of the history of\nthe North Atlantic in the Viking Age and a key element\nin the literary heritage of medieval Europe, they were also\nparticipating in massive and often unanticipated alteration\nof their mid\u2013Atlantic island. It is estimated that 90 per-\ncent of the forest and 40 percent of the soil present at\nthe ninth century Landna\u00b4m has disappeared, and 73 per-\ncent of the modern land surface is currently affected by\nsoil erosion (Arnalds et al. 1997). Scores of deflated Viking-\nage farm ruins now stranded in gravel deserts devoid of\ntrees, grass, and soil bear witness to the complete destruc-\ntion of the presettlement environment in some parts of\nthe country. The growth of the modern Icelandic economy\nsince 1900 was based largely on fishing rather than agri-\nculture, and in many parts of Iceland today rural farming\nsettlements continue to be endangered by soil erosion be-\ngun in the tenth century. The deliberate introduction of\nthe northwestern European Iron age agricultural complex\nof domestic mammals and crops and the accidental in-\ntroduction of a host of European insects and wild plants\n(Buckland et al. 1991a, 1991b) rapidly transformed plant\ncommunities not previously subjected to grazing pressure\nby mammals and created what Paul Buckland has called\nan \u201covigenic landscape\u201d (Buckland 2000). Rapid deforesta-\ntion often closely followed first settlement (Caseldine et al.\n2004; Hallsdo\u00b4ttir 1987) and was, in turn, often followed\nby soil erosion beginning first at higher elevations and\nprogressing downslope; as groundcover was breached over\nwider and wider areas, the highly friable Icelandic andisols\n(volcanic soil type) were exposed to wind and water trans-\nport (Dugmore and Buckland 1991; Dugmore and Erskine\n1994).\nThe biogeography of the North Atlantic islands may\nhave compounded the environmental assessment efforts of\nfirst settlers: Essentially, northwestern European plant com-\nmunities extend from Norway and the British Isles all the\nway to southern Greenland (Buckland 2000; Dugmore et al.\n2005). A ninth-century colonist coming from coastal Troms\ndistrict in North Norway (north temperate climate despite\nits location above the arctic circle) who came hundreds of\nmiles south to settle in Iceland might be excused for failing\nto immediately recognize that pasture plant communities\nfamiliar from home were in fact much closer to their bio-\nlogical range limits in Iceland and thus more vulnerable to\ngrazing pressure. The volcanic andisols of Iceland are also\nsubtly different from most soils of the settlers\u2019 homelands\nand are far more structurally vulnerable to wind and water\n30 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\ntransport (Arnalds 1990) and less responsive to fertilization.\nAn \u201coveroptimistic pioneer fringe\u201d of tenth-century settle-\nment may have pushed into the interior highlands only to\nsee vegetation and soils destroyed by the grazing pressure\nof their imported animals (Sveinbjarnardo\u00b4ttir 1992; but see\nalso Dugmore et al. 2006).\nLocal populations of walrus in southwest Iceland docu-\nmented by zooarchaeology also seem to have been killed\noff in the first few generations of settlement, and wild\nbirds (described as initially \u201cunwary\u201d and easy to kill in\nlater accounts) made up a major portion of animal bone\ncollections (archaeofauna) in southern Iceland (McGovern\n1999; McGovern et al. 2001; Perdikaris and McGovern 2005;\nVe\u00b4steinsson et al. 2002). Analysis of a suite of eighth- to\n11th-century archaeofauna indicated that colonists were\nimporting a very standardized mix of domestic stock, im-\nposing the same suite of cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, horses,\ndogs, and cats on every island settled (McGovern et al.\n2001). This attempt to transplant a familiar economy to\nunsuitable ecosystems resulted in the (brief) attempt at pig\nkeeping in Greenland in the 11th century, and substan-\ntial piggery lasted in Iceland throughout the tenth century\n(McGovern 1985; Olafsson et al. 2005). By the time Ice-\nland became a province of Norway in 1264 (following a\nprolonged civil war among its great magnate families), the\ncountry had become a very different place environmentally\nas well as socially from the Landna\u00b4m age.\nIf the marginalization and relative poverty of the later\nmedieval and early modern period had partly environ-\nmental roots, then it would appear that the early settlers\u2019\napplication of ultimately unsuitable models for land man-\nagement had effectively passed on a crushing bill to their de-\nscendants through their early land-use decisions (Amorosi\net al. 1997). What happened in the undocumented first two\ncenturies of settlement in Iceland? Or perhaps, more specif-\nically, to what extent did the settlers adapt to their new en-\nvironment, creating a sustainable economy for themselves,\nand to what extent did they continue practices developed\nin a different environment, thus reducing their capacity to\nproduce riches and stability for their community?\n\u201cTRADITIONAL NARRATIVE\u201d OF THE LANDNA\u00b4M\nPERIOD (CA. 1990)\nBy the last decade of the 20th century, sustained multidis-\nciplinary (but mainly single-site) investigations in Iceland\nhad produced what may be called a \u201ctraditional narrative,\u201d\ndescribing the process of Landna\u00b4m and its environmen-\ntal consequences (McGovern et al. 1988 is a representative\nexample).\n\u0002 Settlement proceeded from coastal enclaves inland,\nprobably following major river valleys in gradual expan-\nsion (perhaps sometimes too far) into the interior high-\nlands as less wealthy or successful colonists were pushed\nout of the most desirable districts.\n\u0002 First settlers had claimed vast tracts later subdivided\namong followers, but the individual independent farmer\n(bondi) and his farm household (so evident in the sagas)\nwere the basic element of settlement and subsistence.\n\u0002 Human impact on most wild resources was immediate\nand severe. \u201cNatural capital\u201d (in the sense of Cronon\n1991) accumulated since glacial times was rapidly drawn\ndown and expended to finance the rapid expansion of\nthe initially limited numbers of imported domestic stock\nduring the first years of Landna\u00b4m.\n\u0002 Deforestation was uniformly rapid; trees were cleared\nfrom all but a few belatedly protected areas.\n\u0002 Almost all manufactured goods were imported, establish-\ning a long-term dependency on continental Europe for\niron and other critical materials.\n\u0002 Cognitive maladies (\u201cfalse analogy,\u201d \u201cinsufficient detail,\u201d\n\u201cshort observational series\u201d) prevented effective adapta-\ntion of northwestern European economic expectations\nto Icelandic realties.\n\u0002 \u201cTragedy of the commons\u201d (Feeny et al. 1990) had been\nplayed out in the highland pastures, leading to erosion\nrolling downslope and eventually overwhelming infields\nand farms.\n\u0002 Climate cooling in the later Middle Ages impacted a land-\nscape and society already riddled with self-created vul-\nnerabilities and substantially expended natural capital\nreserves.\n\u0002 Competition among elites interfered with effective en-\nvironmental management, pushing tenants into unsus-\ntainable practices and eventually destabilizing whole\nregions.\nThis narrative certainly evokes parallels in many parts\nof the modern world, where overgrazing and land degrada-\ntion affects up to 40 percent of the earth\u2019s vegetated land\nsurface (Brady and Weil 1999). The direct connection of\nthese archaeologically visible processes to both modern Ice-\nlandic and global erosion control efforts was used to justify\napplication for global change funding to supplement tradi-\ntional sources of support for archaeology. Just over a decade\nlater (thanks to this expanded funding), we now recognize\nthat many aspects of the traditional Icelandic environmen-\ntal Landna\u00b4m narrative above are simply wrong, that oth-\ners are clearly oversimplifications, and that the model as a\nwhole needs revision if it is to provide an effective tool for\nmodern landscape managers. These realizations are not the\nresult of gradual accumulation of facts derived from more\nsingle-site excavations but, rather, of a sustained program\nof cross-disciplinary, landscape-scaled investigation made\npossible by the support of U.S., Icelandic, and U.K. global-\nchange research funding to what became the \u201cLandscapes\nof Settlement Project\u201d (see Figure 1).\nLANDSCAPES OF SETTLEMENT IN NORTHERN ICELAND\nThe Landscapes of Settlement project began as a single-site\ninvestigation centered on the site of Hofsta ir near Lake\nMy\u00b4vatn in north eastern Iceland (see Figure 2). Hofsta ir\nwas identified as a potential pre-Christian \u201ctemple\u201d site\nin the 19th century; it was also the site of one of the\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 31\nFIGURE 1. General location map, Lake My\u00b4vatn basin area (Oscar Aldred). The Laxa\u00b4 river flows north to the arctic ocean, and the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4 river\ndrains the now heavily eroded highlands to the south of the lake basin. Active volcanism runs along the east side of the basin.\n32 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 2. Site plan for Hofsta ir. The sunken featured structure G\nwas probably one of the first buildings occupied; it was filled with\nlater midden deposits, as were sunken feature structures A4 and A5\nto the east. The structure D was initially a dwelling, but it was used\nfor hay storage by the final phase as the great hall (AB) reached its\nfull size. Structure E2 is a large and well-constructed privy, and the\noutshot room A2 was used for storage and some smithing. C2 is\na medieval structured added after the abandonment of the great\nhall. Note the indications of benches and interior partitions left by\npost and stake holes in the great hall and the other buildings. Small\nsheet middens extended around E2, but most refuse (bone, ash, fire\ncracked stones, artifacts, etc.) was dumped into the sunken feature\nstructure ruins. (Image courtesy of Gavin Lucas)\nearliest fully professional archaeological excavations in Ice-\nland in 1908 (Bruun and Jo\u00b4nsson 1909, 1910, 1911). Daniel\nBruun and Finnur Jo\u00b4nsson\u2019s partial excavation revealed an\nexceptionally large long hall (floor area 270 m2 whereas\nmost Viking Age halls varied between 60\u201390 m2) with\nassociated middens whose well-preserved bone collections\ngenerated the first professional zooarchaeological report for\nIceland (Winge in Bruun and Jo\u00b4nsson 1909). The site was\npartially reexcavated by Olaf Olsen (1965), who identi-\nfied it as one of a class of \u201ctemple farms\u201d: sites that may\nhave seen regular pagan ritual activity but were primarily\nworking farms and elite residences rather than special-\nized structures like Christian churches or classical Greco-\nRoman temples. In 1991, teams from the Icelandic Insti-\ntute of Archaeology led by Adolf Fri riksson (and joined\nby Ve\u00b4steinsson in 1995) began what became a multiyear\nprogram of open-area excavation (1996\u20132002) that even-\ntually revealed a complex series of outbuildings and un-\ndamaged earlier floor layers and which recovered a large\nwell-preserved archaeofauna from stratified contexts, dat-\ning from the tenth to early 11th centuries (Fri riksson 1993,\n1994; Fri riksson 2004c, Lucas 1998, 1999; Simpson et al.\n1999). The collaborative investigations at Hofsta ir con-\nclusively demonstrated that the site was indeed a working\nfarm, where a full range of settlement-age domestic ani-\nmals were maintained, cooking fires generated ash- and fire-\ncracked stones in large quantities, and local bog iron was\nsmithed regularly.\nHowever, some finds and faunal patterning also sug-\ngest regular ritual activity. During excavation of the wall\ncollapse and the terminal floor layers of the great hall and\nits outshot rooms, the skulls of 11 cattle, one male pig,\none male goat, and one sheep were recovered, all show-\ning depressed fractures between the eyes and marked dif-\nferences in weathering between front and interior of the\nskull, suggesting that they had been displayed outside the\nbuilding for some time before their eventual deposition (see\nFigure 3). All the cattle and caprine skulls either had horn\ncores attached or were naturally hornless (a very rare trait\nin early medieval Nordic stock). Two of the cattle skulls\nwere found face down in the wall collapse, and the rest\nof the skulls were tossed in a pit in one of the side rooms\nof the structure during demolition. As part of the demo-\nlition process, two sheep were beheaded and both heads\nand bodies thrown into the same room but were otherwise\nleft unbutchered. Sheep heads were placed in each door-\nway as demolition was completed, and the great hall was\nabandoned as the farmstead moved approximately 140 me-\nters to the southwest, next to a newly constructed Christian\nchapel (whose two basal radiocarbon dates fall around C.E.\n1000).\nThe cattle skulls are unusual in that three are definitely\nfrom mature bulls (in the 1712 Jar abo\u00b4k register the en-\ntire My\u00b4vatn district had only two immature bulls among\n18 occupied farms), and that horn cores were normally bro-\nken off skulls to extract the horn for craft work in speci-\nmens recovered from midden contexts. Also unusual is the\nage distribution of the skulls with intact dentition: All are\nyoung adult animals around 2.5\u20133.5 years old (in the \u201cprime\nbeef\u201d age). In most Icelandic archaeofauna from all peri-\nods, there is a strong \u201cdairy culling\u201d profile, with a high\npercentage of newborn calves and old adults (presumably\nworn-out milkers) dominating skeletal and dental-age indi-\ncators. At Hofsta ir, the midden deposits generally conform\nto this dairy-age profile, but with an overlay of a small but\nregular addition of cattle also dying in the two\u2013four-year\nrange. Sheep mortality patterns tend to be complicated by\na mix of dairying, meat, and wool production strategies,\nbut again Hofsta ir is unusual in the number of \u201cprime\nmeat age\u201d specimens. Although research is ongoing, cur-\nrent zooarchaeological evidence suggests that some regular\nevent (in the early summer) regularly resulted in the death\nand consumption of cattle and sheep in their prime (thus,\nnot the culling off-take of the normal economy) and the be-\nheading and display of the heads of some cattle and other\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 33\nFIGURE 3. Bull\u2019s skull from wall demolition at Hofsta ir. Depressed fracture between the eyes is typical of these specimens, as is differentially\nheavy weathering on the outer surface and the intact horn cores. Fractured during 11th-century demolition of the great hall, this partial\nskull and set of horns seems to have been displayed for some time on the outside of the building. Radiocarbon dates on these skull fragments\nindicate that they were mounted gradually and not in the same event. (Image courtesy of Tom McGovern)\ndomestic animals. These patterns are not typical of other\nIcelandic archaeofauna and would tend to support Olsen\u2019s\nmodel for a \u201ctemple farm,\u201d combining normal farming ac-\ntivity with recurring seasonal rituals involving the sacrifice,\nconsumption, and display of major domestic animals whose\ndeath would have been expensive in terms of the normal\neconomic cycle as we understand it.\nWhile the excavation program at Hofsta ir progressed,\nsurvey teams documented early sites around the lake, even-\ntually documenting over 1,200 sites and structures in the\nMy\u00b4vatn region (My\u00b4vatnssveit). As test pits and surface\ncollections revealed excellent organic preservation at an\nincreasing number of sites datable to the ninth to 12th\ncenturies in My\u00b4vatnssveit, we somewhat belatedly realized\nthat this inland region was particularly well suited to a sus-\ntained landscape-scale multidisciplinary investigation. Ma-\njor excavations (see Figure 1) have taken place at Sveigakot\n(1999\u20132006), Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar (2001, 2003\u201306), Steinbogi (2002),\nand Selhagi (2001); mapping and small-scale excavation has\nbeen carried out at abandoned farm sites at Oddasta ir,\nBrenna, and Stong (Edvardsson 2001; Edvardsson and\nMcGovern 2004; Ve\u00b4steinsson 2000a, 2002, 2003).\nFollowing a thorough revision of the entire Icelandic\ncorpus of grave goods (Eldja\u00b4rn and Fri riksson 2000), the\nMy\u00b4vatn pre-Christian burial sites as well as all (19) such sites\nin northeastern Iceland have been revisited (Fri riksson\n2004b), offering new insights into the development of\nthe Landna\u00b4m society (Fri riksson 2003, 2004a; Fri riksson\net al. 2005a). New studies of burial topography have led to\nfresh burial finds at Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar (Fri riksson and McGovern\n2005), Da asta ir (Fri riksson et al. 2005b), Litlu-Nu\u00b4par\n(Fri riksson et al. 2005c), and Saltv\u0131\u00b4k (Fri riksson et al.\n2005c), from which both artifacts and human and animal\nbones have been recovered and are now being used to form\na new basis for the chronology of the whole region.\nArchaeological and paleoecological investigation in\nMy\u00b4vatnssveit has been greatly aided by close cooperation\nwith the long-established My\u00b4vatn Research Station (af-\nfiliated to the Icelandic Ministry for the Environment),\nwhich generously provided comparative zoological speci-\nmens, steadily expanding low-level air-photo coverage, and\na trove of local environmental and cultural information and\ncontacts. Collaboration with geophysicists, geoarchaeolo-\ngists, and tephrochronologists from Iceland and the United\n34 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nKingdom also revealed a complex Holocene environmental\nhistory of the region and the presence of a series of datable\ntephra (notably the Landna\u00b4m sequence of C.E. 871 \u00b12, a\ntenth-century Vei ivo\u00a8tn layer, Hekla 1104 and 1300, Katla\n1262, Vei ivo\u00a8tn 1477 and 1717). Our research, combined\nwith that of Gu ru\u00b4n Larsen and colleagues (2002), has built\nup an excellent tephrochronological framework that can be\nused to help answer chronological questions as well as rates\nof environmental change.\nMY\u00b4VATNSSVEIT REGION\nThe My\u00b4vatn region (My\u00b4vatnssveit) straddles the mid\u2013\nAtlantic rift and has been volcanically active for thousands\nof years. The broad shallow lake is fed by underground chan-\nnels that drain a large area of basaltic lava fields and sand\ndeposits. The groundwater feeding the lake through a num-\nber of springs gushing forth along its east shore is rich in\nphosphate and silica, leading to a luxuriant growth of di-\natoms and Cyanobacteria (blue\u2013green algae) that support\nthe populations of chironimid and simuliid flies that pro-\nvide its name (\u201cMidge Lake\u201d). The lake is renowned for rich\nfishing\u2014mainly of arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Despite\nits altitude of 250\u2013300 meters above sea level (hereafter,\nasl), the My\u00b4vatn district supports rich hay fields around the\nlakeshore. Today, the highlands around the lake to both the\nnorth and south are heavily eroded deserts. My\u00b4vatnssveit\nrepresents the largest surviving inland farming community\nin northern Iceland.\nThe major drainage is the Laxa\u00b4 river flowing north-\nward to the sea approximately 60 kilometers away. The Laxa\u00b4\n(\u201csalmon river\u201d) is a famous trout stream (Salmo trutta); in\nits lower reaches, it also receives migratory Atlantic salmon\n(Salmo salar), which do not reach the lake area. The Laxa\u00b4\nis joined by the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4 River, which extends southward into\nthe interior highlands; today the region is largely stripped\nof vegetation and subject to ongoing soil erosion. Many\nsmaller but less fertile lakes surround My\u00b4vatn, also provid-\ning habitat for charr and trout. My\u00b4vatn hosts vast num-\nbers of migratory waterfowl in spring and summer, with\ncurrently over 15,000 breeding pairs nesting around the\nlake. High-quality wet meadow was available around the\nlake, particularly around Reykjahl\u0131\u00b4 in the northeast cor-\nner of the lake (prior to an 18th-century lava flow) and in\na broad periodically flooded marshland with small ponds\nand streams called Framengjar, a delta created by the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4\nriver. Since at least the 18th century, the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4 has been\na destabilized, biologically impoverished, silt-laden, wan-\ndering stream, annually transporting tons of sand from the\nrapidly eroding southern highlands and infilling much of\nthe southern portion of the Framengjar.\nWhen the ninth-century settlers arrived in this inte-\nrior highland lake basin, they found a somewhat different\nenvironment. The hills around the lake were covered with\na mixed vegetation of birch woods, heath, grassland, and\nwetlands. Stands of birch woods probably extended up to\nat least 400 meters, except for the wet meadows around the\nFIGURE 4. Summary pollen diagram from Helluva ostjo\u00a8rn. Tephra\nisochrones have been identified by microprobe analysis at Hekla-\n3, V1477, and V1717. The probable Landna\u00b4m horizon is marked by\nthe onset of soil erosion within the catchment and by a step change\nin the productivity of the lake, both of which are presumed to be\nanthropogenic.\nlakeside and the Framengjar (Olafsdo\u00b4ttir and Gu mundsson\n2002; Olafsdo\u00b4ttir et al. 2001). At higher elevations to the\nnorth and south of the lake, the forest probably thinned\nout into dwarf-shrub heath lands and arctic-alpine herba-\nceous vegetation above 400\u2013500 meters, with some copses\npotentially extending up to 600 meters in elevation.\nGeoarchaeological trenches indicate that at least\n1.5 meters of redeposited silts now cover the late-ninth-\ncentury land surface along the southern edge of the sur-\nviving Framengjar wetlands. Distribution of waterfowl and\nfreshwater fish bones in ninth- to tenth-century midden\ndeposits along the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4 also suggest that the produc-\ntive ponds, streams, and wet meadows of the Framengjar\nwere once broader and extended further south along the\nnow heavily eroded banks of the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4 river (McGovern\net al. 2006). Pollen evidence from a core taken from Lake\nHelluva stjorn, five kilometers southwest of My\u00b4vatn (see\nFigure 4), suggests that birch woodland was not imme-\ndiately cleared from the whole region at first settlement\nbut instead persisted for several centuries (Lawson et al.\nn.d.). Large fragments of burnt wood (including some cross-\nsections of carbonized birch trunks probably originally\nabout ten cm in diameter) have been recovered from site\nmidden deposits dating from the mid\u2013tenth to later-11th\ncenturies, suggesting that wood lots were still producing\nfairly substantial trees over a century after first settlement.\nAfter the 12th century, such large pieces of charcoal become\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 35\nrare. At the sites of Sveigakot (at 286 m asl) and Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar\n(at 316 m asl), a pattern of tree root casts appearing be-\nneath both the ninth-century Landna\u00b4m tephra sequence\nand a midden deposited directly on the Landna\u00b4m tephra\nindicated the presence of a fairly dense wood, with trunk\nspacing about 50\u201375 centimeters apart. By the time a sec-\nond tephra fell in the early- to mid\u2013tenth century, the trees\nwere cleared from around the farm sites and the ash covered\na leveled midden surface. Human impact had begun in the\nMy\u00b4vatn lake basin.\nCHRONOLOGY AND SETTLEMENT IN MY\u00b4VATNSSVEIT\nA growing suite of AMS radiocarbon dates (most on col-\nlagen from cattle or pig bones) provide a framework for\nphasing sites and contexts, especially where the local\ntephra sequence obviates some of the inherent problems\nof the tenth-century radiocarbon calibration plateau (see\nFigure 4). One immediate surprise was the early date for set-\ntlement in My\u00b4vatn. We have encountered definite midden\ndeposits (including imported domesticates) in direct con-\ntact with the late-ninth-century Landna\u00b4m tephra sequence\nat Sveigakot, Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar, Selhagi, and probably Brenna\n(Ve\u00b4steinsson 2002). Still further inland (100 km from the\ncoast and over 400 m asl), midden deposits at the aban-\ndoned site of Undir Sandmu\u00b4la in Krokdalur have also been\nfound in direct contact with the Landna\u00b4m tephra. Available\nAMS radiocarbon dates confirm these surprisingly early in-\ndications of substantial human presence in the deep interior\nbased on the tephra sequence.\nPart of the research program has been the radiocar-\nbon dating (and isotopic analysis) of previously excavated\npre-Christian burials in the region and the selective excava-\ntion of additional graves (Fri riksson 2000, 2004a, 2004b,\n2004c). As many pagan graves included horse and dog skele-\ntons, these domesticates can provide a chronological con-\ntrol even when the human remains produce partly maritime\ncarbon isotope ratios likely to generate \u201cold\u201d dates (Ascough\net al. 2006). As Figure 5 and Table 1 illustrate, the horse\nbones that are associated with My\u00b4vatnssveit burials (wholly\nin the terrestrial food web) produce radiocarbon ages that\nindicate human occupation of this inland zone in the ninth\ncentury. Our old model of a gradual penetration inland by\nindividual households from the coastal zone, driven mainly\nby population pressure, now looks decidedly unlikely, and\nwe need to consider other approaches to understanding the\nIcelandic settlement process.\nPOLITICAL ECOLOGY AND SETTLEMENT PROCESS\nBasal radiocarbon dates from the Greenlandic colony (set-\ntled from Iceland in the late tenth to early 11th centuries)\nalso indicate surprisingly early occupation of what appear to\nhave always been small, marginal farms in highland valleys\nor on steep slopes with poor pasture (Arneborg 2000). As in\nIceland, the radiocarbon evidence does not support the idea\nof a very gradual expansion from a few coastal centers but,\nrather, indicates instead a very swift dispersal within the first\ngeneration of settlement. Orri Ve\u00b4steinsson and colleagues\n(2002) discuss these two unexpected patterns for Landna\u00b4m,\nsuggesting that significant simple population pressure was\nvery unlikely to have produced such early dispersal or such\nstrong resource competition that independent settlers were\nimmediately driven into marginal areas, given the small\ninitial colonizing population. An alternate hypothesis can\nbe drawn from the Icelandic saga accounts of early settle-\nment, particularly the often-cited passage from Egil\u2019s Saga\ndescribing the establishment of the settlement of the chief-\ntain Skallagrim in Borgarfjo\u00a8ro\u00a8ur in SW Iceland:\nSkallagrim was an industrious man. He always kept many\nmen with him and gathered all the resources that were\navailable for subsistence, since at first they had little in\nthe way of livestock to support such a large number of peo-\nple. Such livestock as there was grazed free in the woodland\nall year round . . . there was no lack of driftwood west of\nMyrar. He had a farmstead built on Alftanes and ran an-\nother farm there, and rowed out from it to catch fish and\ncull seals and gather eggs, all of which were there in great\nabundance. There was plenty of driftwood to take back to\nhis farm. Whales beached there, too, in great numbers, and\nthere was wildlife there for the taking at this hunting post:\nthe animals were not used to man and would never flee.\nHe owned a third farm by the sea on the western part of\nMyrar. . . . and he planted crops there and named it Akrar\n(Fields). . . . Skallagrim also sent his men upriver to catch\nsalmon. He put Odd the hermit by Gljufura to take care\nof the salmon fishery there . . . When Skallagrim\u2019s livestock\ngrew in number, it was allowed to roam mountain pas-\ntures for the whole summer. Noticing how much better\nand fatter the animals were that ranged on the heath, and\nalso that the sheep which could not be brought down\nfor winter survived in the mountain valleys, he had a\nfarmstead built up on the mountain, and ran a farm there\nwhere his sheep were kept. . . . In this way, Skallagrim put\nhis livelihood on many footings.\u201d [Egil\u2019s Saga, ch. 29: see\nHreinsson 1997, emphasis added]\nThis image of such a \u201cSkallagrim effect\u201d of chiefly first\nsettlers claiming huge areas and \u201cputting their livelihoods\non many footings\u201d by scattering retainers widely into dif-\nferent resource zones recurs in other written accounts, in-\ncluding the apparently comprehensive Landna\u00b4mabo\u00b4k (Book\nof the Settlements; see Benediktsson 1968). Although such\naccounts provide a mechanism for the rapid, wide dispersal\nof small sites over a large area (perhaps initially occupied\nseasonally or by a very few individuals), it does not ade-\nquately explain the pattern of early tephra and radiocar-\nbon dates for both farms and pre-Christian burials in the\nninth- to early-tenth-century My\u00b4vatnssveit. These are not\nthe isolated dwellings of salmon-fishing hermits but fully\nestablished farms with resident lineages wealthy enough to\nfund elaborate burials of their ranking members.

In addition, we have some rea-\nsons to distrust all the literary accounts of the Landna\u00b4m\nperiod.

Tephra layers indicate that most of these\ndikes (many of which were two to three meters thick and\nextended for kilometers across the landscape) were con-\nstructed in the 11th\u201312th centuries as part of a very la-\nbor intensive program of physical demarcation of cultural\nlandscape. Some of these dikes follow later medieval prop-\nerty or administrative boundaries, but others do not, sug-\ngesting changes in the political and economic landscape\nsince their creation. As the natural environment changed\nand the population of humans and their domestic animals\nincreased, the cultural landscape also adjusted, with the po-\nlitically powerful certainly striving to amass resources and\n38 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nfollowers, but it is difficult to detect the presence of a single\ndominant chieftain of the Skallagrim sort.\nIn My\u00b4vatnssveit, the 18th-century Jar abo\u00b4k and ear-\nlier medieval documents indicate a more complex di-\nvision of power, with an early chieftain\u2019s settlement at\nReykjahl\u0131\u00b4 near the wet meadows of the northeast corner\nof the lake, while two potential competitors at Gr\u00e6navatn\nand Sku\u00b4tusta ir were spaced around the edges of the Fra-\nmengjar wetlands along the south shore.\nA 13th-century saga partially set in My\u00b4vatnssveit re-\ncounts multiple homicides and repeated, eventually suc-\ncessful attempts to assassinate \u201cKiller Sku\u00b4ta\u201d (the supposed\nfounder of Sku\u00b4tusta ir), but it is unclear how much of the\ntale relates to ninth- to tenth-century competition and how\nmuch to more contemporary later medieval power struggles\n(Hreinsson 1997). Hofsta ir would make sense as another\nearly chieftain\u2019s farm, but tephra running beneath the walls\nof the great hall make clear that this farm was in fact set-\ntled in the mid\u2013 to-late tenth century rather than in the first\nwave of Landna\u00b4m. The great hall was probably in use for less\nthan a century before being demolished and abandoned in\nthe 11th century. The \u201ctemple farm\u201d at Hofsta ir thus ap-\npears to be an ultimately failed ploy by a second- or third-\ngeneration chieftain to set himself up in competition with\nthe existing power centers at Reykjahl\u0131\u00b4 , Gr\u00e6navatn, and\nSku\u00b4tusta ir, all of which had access to better quality agri-\ncultural land. Well-furnished pre-Christian burials (some\nwith associated weapons and other valuables) and scattered\nfinds of Viking-age luxuries such as amber beads, a copper\nalloy sword chape (Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar), and ring-headed pin and\nsilver pendant (Hofsta ir) from floor and midden suggest a\ncomfortable level of prosperity on many of the early settle-\nment farms. When earlier patterns of chiefly competition\nwere consolidated by the formation of the parish structure\nin the 12th century, both Reykjahl\u0131\u00b4 and Sku\u00b4tusta ir sig-\nnaled their triumph by erecting parish churches. However,\nthe 12th-century parish boundaries were gerrymandered to\nplace both Hofsta ir and Graenavatn in the more distant\nparish of Reykjahl\u0131\u00b4 instead of the far closer and more con-\nvenient (but then bitterly rival) church farm at Sku\u00b4tusta ir\n(Ve\u00b4steinsson 2000a).\nPolitical power in My\u00b4vatnssveit seems to have been\nfairly fragmented from first settlement, with no local\nparamount chieftain capable of dominating the entire basin\nemerging. It is difficult to model overcentralized or de-\ntached chiefly decision making as a cause for adverse early\nenvironmental impact. Current evidence instead suggests\nat least two or three early chiefly aspirants, probably sur-\nrounded by lesser farmers initially capable of playing off\ncompeting chieftains against each other (Miller 1990). By\nthe 13th century, My\u00b4vatnssveit had become a political\nbackwater marginal to the violent power struggles of the\ngreat magnate families based elsewhere. The 18th-century\nJar abo\u00b4k record shows far less concentration of wealth and\nstock on a few farms than is visible in nearby districts, and\nlittle apparent variation in household subsistence strategy.\nAlthough the district was later known as a refuge during\nfamines (because of its freshwater fishing), as well as a ma-\njor source of mined sulfur (for gunpowder and medicinal\nproduction), it remained economically marginal until the\nexpansion of tourism and industry in the later 20th century\nbrought a resurgence of prosperity probably not seen since\nthe tenth century.\nIRON PRODUCTION AND CHARCOAL MAKING\nAir photos have revealed patterns of circular depressions\nalong ridgelines in several parts of My\u00b4vatnssveit and the sur-\nrounding valleys. Excavation indicates that these are char-\ncoal production pits similar to those documented in south-\nern Iceland (Dugmore et al. 2006), and their density and\nextent suggests a fairly intensive production that could not\nbe sustained by the few modern stands of surviving birch\nwoods. Detailed archaeobotanical, radiocarbon, and tephra\nanalysis is ongoing from the excavated pits but preliminary\nresults indicate that the charcoal largely consisted of locally\ngrown birch-branch wood cut in late spring to early sum-\nmer, which may indicate some form of deliberate manage-\nment of the resource. All of the pits investigated were used\nprior to the fall of the V1477 tephra that filled the pits.\nRecent excavations at Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar have uncovered evi-\ndence of very large-scale iron smelting in the form of a group\nof smelters and smithy structures clustered on a ridgeline\njust above the farm ruin, and quantities of production slag\nand bloomery debris have been recovered from the eroded\nridgeline (Edvardsson 2001). The charcoal produced in the\npits was very similar in form to the material recovered from\nthe middens at Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar, suggesting the smelting at the\nsite used locally produced charcoal. It would appear that\nthis now-abandoned Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4 valley farm was heavily involved\nin iron production and was a major consumer of wood char-\ncoal. Excavations continue at Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar, but it would ap-\npear that one product of Landna\u00b4m-era My\u00b4vatnssveit may\nhave been smelted iron. Although the impact of charcoal\nmaking on the birch woods would have been significant, a\nlocal iron production industry might also provide incentive\nto efforts at woodland management, which, perhaps, was in\nturn reflected in the pollen profile of persisting birch woods\non now-barren hillsides at Helluva stjo\u00a8rn. In any case, early\nIceland was clearly far less dependent on imported iron than\nit was to become in early modern times, when virtually all\nmetal tools were imported.\nPASTURES, SOIL, AND FARMING STRATEGIES\nAnalysis of regional My\u00b4vatnssveit Holocene geomorphol-\nogy based on multiple soil cores tied together by tephra\nisochrones indicates that the highlands around the lake\nbasin have undergone repeated phases of vegetation and\nsoil loss and restabilization since deglaciation, suggesting\nthe instability of the region over the long term (Olafsdo\u00b4ttir\nand Gu mundsson 2002). Following periods of increased\nsediment accumulation circa 5,000 and circa 2,500 years\nbefore present, which Rannveig Olafsdo\u00b4ttir and Hjalti\nGu mundsson (2002) relate to enhanced regional erosion,\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 39\nMy\u00b4vatnssveit seems to have entered a period of stabiliza-\ntion prior to human settlement. It is possible that in pre-\nLandna\u00b4m times, the aeolian sediment accumulation form-\ning the regions\u2019 soil was significantly affected by rates of\ntephra production. Volcanic ash is a major component of\nthe Icelandic andisols, and in prehistoric times when sedi-\nment accumulation rates were generally lower than in the\nlast 500 years, the proportion that was derived from re-\nworked tephra falling in the interior barren lands could\nhave been significantly higher. It is notable that the basal\nages of soils in the My\u00b4vatnssveit region become younger\ninto the interior, a pattern consistent with soil cover ex-\ntending inland as more and more tephra is deposited in\nthe highlands and reworked downslope to aid soil profile\nformation. Crucial changes occur with settlement. Gener-\nally, across Iceland, aeolian sediment accumulation rates in-\ncrease, a change that Sigurdur Tho\u00b4rarinsson (1961) convinc-\ningly argued to be a result of soil erosion. Many studies have\nsince reinforced this picture (e.g., Dugmore et al. 2000), sug-\ngesting a widespread shift in environmental processes as a\nresult of human impacts, more sediment on the move as a\nresult of the widespread development of erosion patches in\nvegetated areas, and, as a result, greater rates of accumula-\ntion in the reducing areas of surviving vegetation and soil\ncover.\nIn contrast to areas of southern Iceland (e.g.,\nDugmore and Buckland 1991; Dugmore et al. 2000), ge-\nomorphological and tephrochronological studies in the\nvicinity of the archaeological sites along the Kra\u00b4ka\u00b4\n(Sveigakot and Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar) indicate a comparatively lim-\nited increase in aeolian sediment accumulation following\nthe Norse settlement of the area. In general, there appears to\nbe a relatively slow increase in regional soil erosion through\nthe Middle Ages; with the exception of some localized\nepisodes of soil erosion prior to 1477, it seems that it was not\nuntil after the deposition of the Vei ivo\u00a8tn 1717 tephra layer\nthat key local thresholds were crossed. The 18th-century\nrecord is characterized by greatly increased accumulation\nrates (up to 20 times the 1477\u20131717 rate in some profiles)\nand the presence of repeated sand layers in the profiles, a\nfeature not present in the older and pre-Landna\u00b4m soils. In\ngeneral, therefore, the soil profiles in the area do not suggest\nthat Landna\u00b4m immediately triggered widespread erosion\non the regional scale in My\u00b4vatnssveit, and that the catas-\ntrophic levels of deflation and erosion visible in the mod-\nern landscape postdate C.E. 1700 (see also Einarsson et al.\n1988).\nWithin this broad picture, there is much variability in\nsoil erosion impact on the scale of the individual farm hold-\ning, and investigations focused on this scale produce ev-\nidence of variability in land management between farms.\nOlafsdo\u00b4ttir and Gu mundsson\u2019s (2002) detailed investiga-\ntion of accumulation patterns in grazing estates associ-\nated with the contrasting early settlements at Hofsta ir and\nSveigakot indicate marked differences in human impacts\n(Simpson et al. 2004). In both locations, there is evidence\nof an acceleration of soil erosion with settlement through\nto circa C.E. 1477. However, at Hofsta ir there was a subse-\nquent reduction in erosion rates to substantially below the\nregional average, whereas at Sveigakot the acceleration of\nerosion that began with settlement continued, leaving the\narea as subarctic desert. Part of the explanation for these dif-\nferences in settlement impacts is inherent in landscape sen-\nsitivities: Presettlement erosion patterns indicate a greater\nrate of sediment movement at Sveigakot compared to\nHofsta ir, but positive land management strategies were\nalso of significance at Hofsta ir. Here, on a continuously\noccupied farm site, the later reduction in land degrada-\ntion to substantially below the regional average indicates\na household community whose management of livestock\ninvolved grazing to minimize negative land degradation im-\npacts (Thomson and Simpson 2006, in press).\nSuggestions of early land management within the\nHofsta ir estate are not confined to grazing livestock; there\nis also evidence of fuel resources regulation and man-\nagement (Simpson et al. 2003; Ve\u00b4steinsson and Simpson\n2004). Micromorphological and image-based analyses of\nfuel residues found in midden stratigraphies indicates that\nfuel resources included peat, mineral-based turf, and birch\nwood but with temporal trends in utilization mix. Residues\nfrom low temperature domestic combustion of mineral-\nbased turf are evident throughout midden stratigraphies,\nalthough more concentrated in earlier phases. In contrast,\npeat utilization is almost entirely associated with high, \u201cin-\ndustrial\u201d temperature combustion and evident throughout\nthe stratigraphy, whereas wood ash residues from low and\nhigh temperature combustion become more prevalent in\nlater phases of midden stratigraphies. This latter observa-\ntion hints that woodland management may have promoted\ndifferent age structures and densities of woodland, raising\nproductivity for a time.\nAlthough Hofsta ir and Sveigakot are less than 12 kilo-\nmeters apart, their trajectories of human\u2013stock\u2013vegetation\u2013\nsoil interactions were critically different. The eventual out-\ncomes for the farm households were also different. Hofsta ir\nis still farmed and was continuously occupied, despite some\nshifts of the dwelling around its home field. Sveigakot was\nsettled earlier, initially by people living in a series of sunken-\nfeatured buildings, which were replaced by a small hall\naround 60 square meters in floor area in the late tenth cen-\ntury. After some decades it was briefly abandoned, and when\nreoccupied in the late 11th century, its hall floor area was\nshortened to circa 35 square meters. In addition, the associ-\nated archaeofauna shows changes (emphasizing wool pro-\nduction), which may be associated with declining status or\ntenantry. The site was completely abandoned by the early\n13th century and was only rediscovered by archaeological\nsurvey in 1998, as bone and charcoal eroded out of deflating\nmiddens surrounded by a denuded rock field (Ve\u00b4steinsson\n2000a). The continuity of farm-management strategy may\nhave been an important factor in preserving the pro-\nductivity of pasture communities around Hofsta ir, and\nthe changing economic and social fortunes of Sveigakot\u2019s\nhousehold certainly was a factor in the decline and eventual\n40 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 6.

In early\nIceland, as in so many areas today, human poverty and pow-\nerlessness are bad for pastures as well as people.\nWe now know that animal management strategy did\nnot remain static throughout the period of settlement.\nArchaeofauna from Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar, Sveigakot, Hofsta ir, and\nSelhagi clearly indicate that early settlers of My\u00b4vatnssveit\ndid indeed introduce the standard Landna\u00b4m complex of\ncattle, sheep, goats, horses, and pigs whose combined graz-\ning, browsing, and rooting would certainly be effective in\ndeforestation\u2014and which, if unchecked, could lead to soil\nexposure and erosion. However, this initial mix of domes-\nticates was altered during the tenth century, as goats be-\ncame increasingly rare and pigs were progressively removed\nfrom the farmyard, eventually becoming extinct in Iceland\n(see Figure 6). As the early-13th-century archaeofauna from\nSteinbogi indicates, there was also a shift away from cat-\ntle production toward the sheep-dominated pattern of the\n18th-century Jar abo\u00b4k farms (see Figure 7). Although the\nearly settlers certainly initially introduced a traditional mix\nof domestic stock familiar from their homelands, they were\nby no means passive hyperconservative \u201cprisoners of cul-\nture\u201d (Descola and Pa\u00b4lsson 1996), incapable of altering their\nfarming strategy as they gained local experience and as local\nwoodlands (which made pig and goat keeping inexpensive)\nshrank.\nSurviving law codes postdate the Landna\u00b4m period by\ncenturies but contain a wealth of land-use and stocking leg-\nislation clearly shaped by practical experience and extensive\ncase-by-case litigation built up over years. Gra\u00b4ga\u00b4s (surviving\nin late-13th-century manuscripts; see Dennis et al. 1993)\nmakes clear that pigs were by then viewed mainly as \u201cprob-\nlem animals,\u201d ones likely to generate disputes rather than\neconomic mainstays, and detailed land management pro-\nvisions make equally clear that access and use of common\npasturage was by no means open or unregulated. As Ian\nSimpson and colleagues note, \u201cRegulatory mechanisms\nwere in place to prevent overgrazing from at least the\n1200s A.D., with sufficient biomass to support the num-\nbers of domestic livestock indicated from historic sources\u201d\n(2001:176). Although some aspects of the surviving law\ncodes penalize underuse of pasture vegetation, the overall\neffect of the laws (if enforced) would be to closely regulate\ngrazing pressure on common pool resource pastures.\nEnvironmental simulation modeling predicting spatial\nand temporal patterns of vegetation biomass production\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 41\nFIGURE 7. Changing ratios of caprine (sheep and goat) and cattle bones from larger archaeofauna spanning the ninth to 14th century in\nIceland. The earliest archaeofauna tend to have the highest ratio of cattle to caprine bones, but the pattern differs between regions. Higher\nstatus sites tend to have more cattle. The conversion to a largely sheep-based farming strategy appears to occur in the late 12th to early\n13th century.\nand utilization (Bu\u00b4model; Thomson and Simpson 2006)\nhas been used to compare landscapes of the Landna\u00b4m\nand Jar abo\u00b4k periods (Simpson et al. 2001; Thomson and\nSimpson 2006, in press). Observations derived from this ap-\nproach suggest that there were spatial and temporal vari-\nations in productivity within and between historic graz-\ning areas and indicate that land degradation was not an\ninevitable consequence of the livestock introduced with\nsettlement. The model also clearly indicates that utiliz-\nable plant biomass productions in the winter and sum-\nmer grazing areas far exceeded potential grazing pressure,\neven when stock numbers were inflated beyond those in-\ndicated by archaeology or the Jar abo\u00b4k record. The crit-\nical variable appears to be not total stock numbers, but\nthe timing of the annual removal of flocks in autumn.\nIf animals are allowed to graze even a week beyond the\nend of grass growth, pasture degradation sets in, leading\neventually to breaching of the soil cover and rapid ero-\nsion. Correct assessment of the climatically driven on-\nset of winter in the highlands thus appears to have been\nat least as important as management of total stocking\nlevels.\nLONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT:\nWATERFOWL AND EGG COLLECTION\nThe My\u00b4vatn waterfowl nesting area is today a World\nHeritage site, protected by Icelandic law since 1974, but lo-\ncal residents are still permitted to continue their traditional\nharvest of duck eggs. Duck-egg harvesting from the nest-\ning grounds around My\u00b4vatn is first mentioned in the 1712\nJar abo\u00b4k entry. The present rule to leave at least four to\nfive eggs in the nest for the female to incubate is first men-\ntioned by a traveler in the area in 1862 (Shepherd 1867),\nbut self-imposed restrictions to harvesting are mentioned\nsome 40 years earlier (Thienemann 1827). The four-to-five\negg rule ensures a sustainable yield, as the ducks produce\nonly 0.3\u20132.8 young per female a year on the average and\nthe overall production of young is regulated by the avail-\nability of food in the lake, mainly midges and their lar-\nvae and small crustaceans (Gardarsson and Einarsson 1997,\n2002, 2004). Today adult waterfowl are still not hunted, but\nthe lakeside farmers collect an average of 10,000 eggs each\nspring. The zooarchaeological record for ninth- to 11th-\ncentury My\u00b4vatnssveit indicates that bird bones were a mi-\nnor element in the archaeofauna (see Figure 8), and what\n42 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nFIGURE 8. Wild and domestic species use in ninth-to-12th\u2013century My\u00b4vatn and Krokdalur. Note the presence of small quantities of bird\nbones on all sites, nearly all of which are Ptarmigan rather than nonmigratory waterfowl. Marine and freshwater fish bones are common\non most sites in the region, outnumbering domestic mammal bones in the Laxa\u00b4 valley area.\nbird hunting there was focused in every case on the non-\nmigratory ptarmigan (grouse, Lagopus mutus), even at Sel-\nhagi in the heart of the waterfowl nesting area. By contrast,\nthe ninth- to 13th-century midden layers at Hr\u0131\u00b4sheimar,\nSelhagi, Brenna, Hofsta ir, and Steinbogi are rich in bird\neggshell, with thousands of fragments recovered from some\ncontexts. Microscopic analysis indicates that the majority\nof these fragments are from duck eggs, but ptarmigan and\nseabird eggshells were also present (McGovern et al. 2006).\nThese archaeological data indicate that the successful com-\nmunity management of waterfowl for sustainable egg col-\nlection is well over a millennium old (see Table 2). This ex-\nample of genuinely long-term sustainable wild resource use\nagain conflicts with notions of the inevitability of human\ndraw-down of natural capital following first settlement.\nCOASTAL CONNECTIONS: SCALES OF INTEGRATION OF\nTHE LANDNA\u00b4M COMMUNITY\nOne surprise in the archaeofauna from inland My\u00b4vatnssveit\nhas been the presence of marine species 50\u201360 kilome-\nters from the nearest salt water. Seal bones have been\nfound at Hofsta ir and Sveigakot, and a segment of por-\npoise tail (with butchery marks) was recovered from the\nlate-ninth-century basal layers at Sveigakot. Sea bird bones\nand seabird eggshell have been recovered from Selhagi,\nSveigakot, and Hofsta ir, and tiny mussel shells proba-\nbly transported attached to seaweed root balls are present\nin all the My\u00b4vatnssveit archaeofauna (McGovern et al.\n2006).\nHowever, fish are the most common wild taxa in these\ninland archaeofauna (see Figure 8). Unsurprisingly, locally\navailable freshwater salmon-family fish (arctic charr and\nbrown trout) make up the great majority of the identi-\nfied specimens. Fluctuation in the relative abundance of\ncharr and trout in these collections probably relate to com-\nplex interactions of local and regional patterns of ero-\nsion and deforestation, alteration of streamside and lake-\nside ecology, changing lake-nutrient cycling patterns, and\nclimate change. A summary of the recent and paleoeco-\nlogical evidence for changes in freshwater fish ecology in\nMy\u00b4vatnssveit appears in Lawson et al. 2005, and a coop-\nerative project on long-term biological change in isolated\nIcelandic salmonid populations is now underway.

Although the overwhelming majority of bones are from the nonmigratory Ptarmigan (grouse), there are substantial concentrations of\nmigratory waterfowl eggs. There are both bones and eggshell from seabirds present on several of the sites, indicating the importance of the\ncoastal connection which also brought sea mammal remains and substantial amounts of marine fish to these inland farms.\nother areas, zooarchaeological data have proven useful for\nmodern biological conservation efforts (Lauwerier and Plug\n2004).\nHowever, bones of marine cod family fish (gadid) make\nup 12\u201330 percent of the identifiable fish from the fully\nquantifiable collections, and their presence in My\u00b4vatnssveit\nclearly relates more to cultural than to natural patterns\n(McGovern et al. 2006; Perdikaris and McGovern in press).\nAlthough the locally available trout and charr are repre-\nsented by the bones of the whole skeleton, the marine fish\nhave a skeletal element distribution strongly indicating the\ntransport of a prepared fish product. Figure 9 illustrates the\nbones found on the inland sites relative to the complete\nfish skeleton. Heads and midbody vertebrae are conspicu-\nously absent. The bones around the gill opening (esp. the\ndense cleithrum) tend to be left in most dried fish prod-\nFIGURE 9. Cod skeleton with parts found on the inland\nMy\u00b4vatnssveit sites indicated in darker tone.

This pattern is seen uniformly in all My\u00b4vatn\narchaeofauna.\nucts to keep the filleted upper body together and to aid in\nspreading the body cavity for drying. This bone element\ndistribution suggests that the Viking-age preserved fish was\na flat-dried product (similar to modern Norwegian klipfisk)\nrather than the round-dried stockfish typical of the later\nfully commercial international fishery of the 11th\u201319th\ncenturies. High species diversity within the gadid family\nis evident in these ninth- to 11th-century inland archaeo-\nfauna, including haddock, saithe, and ling, as well as the\nAtlantic cod, which come to dominate the later medieval\nto early modern international trade (Amundsen et al. 2005;\nPerdikaris and McGovern 2005). Similar patterns are visible\nin Iron Age North Norwegian fisheries, where elites man-\naged an extensive production and local exchange of air-\ndried fish dating back to the fifth century C.E. (Perdikaris\n1999).\nIn line with the occurrence of freshwater fish, marine\nmammals and marine fish in archaeofauna are generally\ndominated by domestic mammals: The \u03b413C results (\u221218.9\nto \u221219.7 percent), derived from the analyses of human bone\ncollagen from the inland My\u00b4vatnssveit pre-Christian buri-\nals, indicate a small enrichment over values that would be\ntypical of a wholly terrestrial diet in northern hemisphere\nand high-latitude populations, and which would tend to\nindicate some reliance on aquatic resources. Jette Arneborg\nand colleagues (1999) suggest for population groups from\nhigh northern latitudes that a \u03b413C end member of \u221221.0\npercent would be appropriate for a 100 percent terrestrial\ndiet whereas 12.5 percent would represent the end mem-\nber for 100 percent marine diet. Detailed information on\nthe effect of freshwater fish consumption on human bone\ncollagen \u03b413C values is not well documented. Gordon Cook\n44 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nand colleagues (2002) have demonstrated a similar range\nof \u03b413C values (\u221218.2 to \u221219.5 percent) for consumption\nof significant freshwater resources at Schela Cladovei in the\nIron Gates Gorge of the River Danube during the Mesolithic.\nHowever, these small shifts in \u03b413C were accompanied by\nsignificantly greater shifts in \u03b415N (range = +13.2 to +15.3\npercent; cf. approximately +8 percent for a totally terres-\ntrial diet). The My\u00b4vatnssveit \u03b415N values were lower in range\n(+7.7 to +10.0 percent); however, the shift would depend\non the species consumed and its trophic level in the fresh-\nwater food web.\nBecause of the mix of freshwater and marine aquatic\nresources at My\u00b4vatnssveit, it may not possible to adopt the\nstrategy of Arneborg et al. (1999) to determine the ma-\nrine 14C reservoir correction in individual humans, based\non the \u03b413C results. Furthermore, without evidence to the\ncontrary, we cannot rule out the possibility of a freshwater\nreservoir effect (Cook et al. 2001). The age offset between\nthe humans and associated horse burials certainly indicate\nthat a reservoir effect does exist. More work is currently un-\nder way on the chronology and isotopic dietary reconstruc-\ntion of Icelandic pre-Christian burials, but at present these\ndata appear to provide confirmation of the role of aquatic\nproducts in the diet of inland farmers during the settlement\nage.\nDespite fully established farming and extensive use of\nlocal freshwater fish and well-managed egg collection, the\neighth- to 11th-century settlers of My\u00b4vatnssveit felt the\nneed to regularly provision themselves with marine prod-\nucts. This Viking-age inland distribution of marine prod-\nucts (esp. dried fish) is best documented in My\u00b4vatnssveit,\nbut marine fish and sea mammal bones have also been re-\ncovered from early inland sites in eastern Iceland (A albo\u00b4l;\nMcGovern n.d.), inland Eyjafjord (Granasta ir; Einarsson\n1994), and in western Iceland (Reykholt and Ha\u00b4ls;\nMcGovern 2004). The inland transfer of marine fish and\nother marine resources was definitely an established pat-\ntern in most parts of tenth-century Iceland. However the\nacquisition of coastal resources was organized (chiefly sta-\nple goods exchange, paired interhousehold transfers, labor\nservice), it appears that even in the earliest days of settle-\nment neither the single farmstead nor even the local district\n(hreppur) was in fact the basic unit of economic survival. We\nneed to consider the role and importance of trade and ex-\nchange networks potentially connecting whole quarters of\nIceland, and to take seriously the entrepreneurial role of\nchieftains who were evidently not simply managers of their\nown prosperous farms. New evidence of early specialized\nfishing settlements in northwest Iceland further suggest the\nexistence of an extensive distribution network that predates\nthe historical international fisheries of the later Middle Ages\n(Amundsen et al. 2005; Edvardsson 2001, 2005; Edvardsson\nand McGovern 2005; Edvardsson et al. 2004; Krivogorskaya\net al. 2005; McGovern et al. 2006). In light of these findings,\nthe location of Hofsta ir at the juncture of the lake basin\nand the route along the Laxa\u00b4 valley to the sea may in itself\nbe significant. Did an aspiring tenth-century chieftain lack-\ning high-quality pasture land attempt to control the flow\nof marine resources inland as well as playing the religion\ncard?\nCOMPLICATING CLIMATE INSTABILITY\nUntil recently, most paleoclimatic data sets had resolution\non the order of centuries or millennia, which led to simplis-\ntic or deterministic attempts to correlate climate and culture\n(Grove 1988; McGovern 1991). A major accomplishment of\nmodern climatology has been the development of multiple\nclimatic proxy indicators whose resolution is on the \u201chu-\nman scale\u201d of decades, years, or seasons (Jones and Mann\n2004; Meeker and Mayewski 2002). In the North Atlantic\ncontext, this most notably includes the Greenland Ice Sheet\ncores. The ice core data requires careful and informed inter-\npretation, but it can be used to document proxy temper-\natures on the seasonal scale, transforming the debate over\nclimate impact on the extinction of the Norse Greenlanders\n(Barlow et al. 1997; Buckland et al. 1996). The new high-\nresolution proxy indicators are not restricted to isotopic\ntemperature reconstruction; they also provide geochemical\nindicators of sea ice extent and storminess, which suggest\nthat the North Atlantic of the Viking Age was relatively calm\nand ice free compared to conditions after the 15th century\n(Dawson et al. 2003).\nThese multiple high-resolution indicators permit better\ninvestigation of key questions as to which aspects of climate\nchange are potentially significant in terms of potential im-\npacts on people. One view is that a year of extremely bad\nweather (resulting in poor fodder crops or high neonatal\nfatalities in domesticated livestock) could create issues for\nsome (the poorest and most marginalized settlements), but\na sequence of poor weather and repeated losses and poor\nyields is more likely to create significant problems for many,\nespecially those in marginal environmental or cultural set-\ntings (e.g., Parry 1978). Simple economic response mod-\nels (Farmpact; see McGovern 1991; McGovern et al. 1988)\ndeveloped for North Atlantic farming economies heavily\ndependent on stock herding and pasture productivity have\nindicated that even very extreme events would have been\nless systemically damaging than a closely spaced series of\nless extreme, moderately poor growing seasons (Barlow et al.\n1997). Sequence and spacing of climate events thus prob-\nably mattered more in terms of actual climate impact on\nNorth Atlantic medieval economies than did extreme cold\nspikes.\nPerhaps an even more important factor in creating cli-\nmatic economic impact could be predictability. Northern\nsocieties tend to be well buffered against a wide range of\nclimate fluctuation, and demographic records for early\nmodern Iceland reveal considerable resilience and success\nin containing human mortality, even in the face of com-\nbined cold weather and volcanic eruption (Vasey 1996). Ef-\nfective responses to bad seasons and even to strings of bad\nseasons were certainly within the competence of the tra-\nditional knowledge systems of the Viking Age Icelanders,\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 45\nand awareness of climatic variability is evident in the me-\ndieval law codes and annals (Ogilvie and McGovern 2000).\nHowever, the effectiveness of any climate response strat-\negy depends on an ability to reasonably anticipate and pre-\ndict the behavior of key environmental variables within\na tolerable range (such as the end of the growing season\nin upland pastures), so that key renewable resources are\nnot degraded beyond recovery. Climatic thresholds are fa-\nmously hard to detect until crossed, and increasing inter-\nannual variability continues to adversely affect our own\nability to effectively respond to rapid climate change in\nthe modern circumpolar north. Increasing variability and\ndeclining predictability of climate\u2013environment\u2013resource\ninteractions definitely stress local resource management\nstrategies of northern peoples today, in some cases creating\na frightening sense of devaluation of long-held traditional\nknowledge bases (Arctic Climate Impacts Assessment 2004).\nSimilar problems in separating signal from noise certainly\nafflicted medieval communities, and declining predictabil-\nity must be a key explanation for increased environmental\ndegradation in the generally unstable conditions of the so-\ncalled Little Ice Age of the later Middle Ages (Simpson et al.\n2001).\nA novel way to identify changes in interannual pre-\ndictability in the GISP2 (Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2)\nproxy records is through the use of a cumulative assessment\nof annual deviations from the long-term mean (Dugmore\net al. in press). Cumulative measures are generally not used\nin the analysis of time series of climate data because they\nadd data from one year to the next rather than leaving each\nseason as an independent event. The advantage of a cu-\nmulative approach when considering human dimensions\nis the \u201cmemory effect\u201d it simulates: A trajectory indicates\nchange that is potentially predictable, and a \u201cturn over\u201d\npoint highlights a time when the established pattern of the\npast change is no accurate guide to future trends. In addi-\ntion, steeper parts of the graph indicate extreme events or\nrapid change (see Figure 10).\nSeveral key patterns emerge from cumulative assess-\nments of the GISP2 data sets. Some highlight the on-\nset of changes in the later Middle Ages with fundamen-\ntal climate shifts in the early- to mid\u201315th century and\nthe extremes of the early 16th century. Others pick out\nearlier and potentially significant changes C.E. 975\u2013C.E.\n1040 and highlight the nadirs of the 18th century (prob-\nably linked to the massive erosion visible after the 1717\nash fall). For the farmers of My\u00b4vatnssveit, the increase in\nshort-term variability of the tenth to 11th centuries would\nhave been coupled with progressive deforestation, cultural\nlandscape remodeling (probably involving intensive com-\npetition among elites), the introduction of Christianity,\nand a shift in stock-raising strategy away from pigs, goats,\nand cattle and toward sheep. In this context, it may not\nbe surprising that some medieval land managers got the\ncritical timing wrong for bringing down flocks from up-\nlands or failed to optimally manage winter grazing in the\nlowlands.\nFIGURE 10. GISP\u20132 proxy storminess data. Deviations from mean\nPPB Na+ (left-hand scale), cumulative deviations from the mean\nPPB Na+ (right-hand scale). The cumulative annual deviations from\nthe overall mean show a key change in 1425, a turning point when\nestablished patterns of change became a misleading guide to the\nfuture. Similar but less sustained changes occurred earlier at 975\nand 1040; later, extreme events (e.g., the changes of the 1740s)\nseem to have become more characteristic.\nSUSTAINABLE AND UNSUSTAINABLE RESOURCE USE\nON THE MILLENNIAL SCALE\nThe full results of the NSF \u201cLandscapes of Settlement\nProject\u201d are still appearing, but we can already offer a num-\nber of important corrections to the previously accepted\nnarrative of early settlement and human environmental\nimpact.\n\u0002 Settlement patterns at Landna\u00b4m were far more complex\nthan previously realized. Inland settlement (perhaps at\nwhat was then the upper boundary between woodland\nand highland pastures) was early\u2014possibly predating\nthe occupation of the valley systems of the lower eleva-\ntions. These early settlements were extensive: They prob-\nably involved whole communities rather than individual\nhouseholds or chieftains and a few followers. The later\ndocumentary sources describing Landna\u00b4m need reexam-\nination in light of current archaeology.\n\u0002 Early human impact in My\u00b4vatnssveit involved local but\nnot universal deforestation, and clearance may have\nbeen more gradual than in southern Iceland. Iron and\ncharcoal production may have provided both additional\npressure on forest resources and an incentive to conserve\nwoodland. The reduction in pigs and goats notable in\nthe zooarchaeological record may well reflect efforts to\nslow forest destruction rather than a simple response\nto deforestation, as the faunal shift occurs at least a\ncentury before pollen evidence for effective deforesta-\ntion. The most severe erosion is not associated with the\ninitial settlement but, rather, with later Middle Ages and\nearly modern periods.\n\u0002 Human impact on pasture communities and soils ini-\ntially was very local. Although the massive erosion catas-\ntrophe that began after 1717 has tended to create a\n46 American Anthropologist \u2022 Vol. 109, No. 1 \u2022 March 2007\nhomogenized, deflated, gravel-field landscape in the\nworst impacted areas around the lake basin, site-focused,\nintensive soil science investigations backed by impact\nmodeling reveal considerable differences between early\nmanagement strategies and resulting human impacts in\nthe different farm catchments. It is possible to recon-\nstruct household-level land management practices while\nintegrating these findings with regional-scale indicators.\n\u0002 Political competition in the first two centuries of settle-\nment was complex, and it appears to have involved a\nrange of strategies including the control of pasture re-\nsources, the manipulation of regional staple goods ex-\nchange, iron and charcoal production, and investment\nin pre-Christian ritual and feasting. Following the adop-\ntion of Christianity, the clearance of the valley forests\nfor settlement, and the depletion of at least some of the\nwoodlands of the upper elevations, the economic and\nritual landscape changed, affecting the political ecology\nof power and probably permanently relegating upland\ncommunities like My\u00b4vatnssveit to political and eco-\nnomic marginality. The collapse of the attempted \u201cfaith-\nbased\u201d chieftainship at Hofsta ir probably reflected fac-\ntors beyond the devaluation of an investment in a temple\nfarm by change in cult, including changing patterns of\ntrade and new routes to the sea that bypassed Hofsta ir.\n\u0002 Although information management maladies associated\nwith colonization of deceptively familiar North Atlantic\necosystems certainly provided unwelcome surprises to\nearly Icelandic settlers, the main cognitive challenges\nseem to have been associated with changes in cli-\nmatic stability and predictability after the first century\nof Landna\u00b4m. Patterns of land use, traditional herding\nknowledge, and the critical timing for the end of up-\nland grazing would all be impacted by changes in what\nhad become a well-understood set of environmental pa-\nrameters. \u201cTragedy of the commons\u201d is an unlikely ex-\nplanation for the eventual failure of herding systems to\nprevent large-scale erosion. Inability to cope with radical\nincreases in environmental variability is far more likely\nto be the ultimate cause of eventual catastrophic soil loss.\n\u0002 Not everything went wrong. The My\u00b4vatn record indi-\ncates significant human response to changing environ-\nment, much probably aimed at resource management as\nwell as chiefly aggrandizement. The eventual failure to\nconserve soils and pasturelands over much of the region\ncan be balanced against the impressive record of success-\nful sustainable management of the migratory bird popu-\nlation of My\u00b4vatn. Some remedies were probably applied\ntoo little and too late, others may have been frustrated\nby rapid and unpredictable climate change or by simple\ninability to predict volcanic eruptions or external politi-\ncal changes. However, the pastures are still green around\nHofsta ir, and the waterfowl still come in their thousands\neach spring to the lake shore. These features of the land-\nscape of My\u00b4vatnssveit are as much a result of a thousand\nyears of human environmental management as are the\neroded hills beyond the lake.\nHISTORICAL ECOLOGY AND MODERN GLOBAL\nCHANGE\nAnthropologists instinctively find attractive the notion that\nsmall-scale, traditional societies are good stewards of land\nand resources. However, \u201csustainability\u201d of resource use\nneeds to be assessed on the long-time scale of centuries\nand millennia if we are to avoid simply confusing \u201cserial\nunsustainability\u201d (Kohler 2004) or cycles of \u201crape, ruin,\nand starve\u201d (McGovern 1985) with the near-homeostasis\nenvisaged by modern resource planning. Although there\nare clearly huge social and technological gaps between Ice-\nlandic Viking Age farmers and modern resource mangers\nof global change impacts, some lessons of potentially wide\napplication may be drawn from the My\u00b4vatn research:\n\u0002 Long-term sustainability is possible. Millennial-scale\nsustainable use of waterfowl and their eggs can be doc-\numented at My\u00b4vatn. This pattern seems to extend to\nfirst settlement and certainly provides a demonstration\nthat small-scale, nonstate societies can organize and en-\nforce genuinely sustainable resource use over a thousand\nyears, despite climate fluctuation and severe economic\nhardship. The long-term record thus contains messages\nof hope for the future as well as warnings.\n\u0002 Continuity and security count. It is probably no ac-\ncident that the heavily eroded site of Sveigakot under-\nwent cycles of abandonment and reoccupation at pro-\ngressively lower-status levels, whereas the still-occupied\nsite of Hofsta ir is still richly vegetated. The geoarchae-\nological evidence for successful long-term soil manage-\nment at Hofsta ir certainly reflects in part the continuity\nof occupation by an upper-middle ranking household.\nImpoverished farmers with insecure land tenure manage\nresources differently from secure landowners expecting\nto pass on inheritance to kin.\n\u0002 Predictability is critical. Successful local-level range\nmanagement systems that have achieved broadly sus-\ntainable patterns of resource consumption for centuries\nmay well be overwhelmed by the simultaneous rapid\nincreases in rate of change coupled with simultaneous\ndecrease in interseasonal predictability. This finding has\nmajor implications for modern attempts to sustainably\nmanage agricultural systems in the face of rapid and in-\ncreasingly unpredictable climate change. Planning for\nuncertainty is difficult, but this seems a critical need\nfor modern resource managers. Spending more resources\non updating older baselines and learning more about\npast variability is indicated; complacency about \u201cknown\nranges\u201d of environmental change is not. Sustainable fu-\ntures are not built on ignorance.\nSCIENCE MANAGEMENT LESSONS LEARNED\nThe experience of committing a decade of international,\ninterdisciplinary effort to My\u00b4vatnssveit has provided some\nhumbling lessons. Some of the most difficult issues limiting\neffective interdisciplinary cooperation (esp. between social\nMcGovern et al. \u2022 Landscapes of Settlement 47\nand natural scientists) are the manifold problems of scale\nmatching. Had the investigations been limited to a typi-\ncal archaeological project of two or three seasons of inten-\nsive excavation on a single site combined with a catchment\nsurvey, we would have totally misunderstood the larger re-\ngional pattern and would have lacked the comparison of\nnearby sites that provide some basis for sorting out vari-\nability caused by time, place, environmental change, and\nchance. If a broad-brush regional scale approach had been\napplied, based on site survey backed by a few soil profiles or\npollen cores, we would have also come to a largely false ap-\npreciation of the actual dynamics of human\u2013environmental\ninteractions in the study area. The marvelous isochrones\nprovided by the well-studied Icelandic tephra have been in-\nvaluable, but the single greatest asset to effective integration\nhas been prolonged fieldwork involving sustained focus on\na common set of problems within a common research area.\nPersistence may matter more than project size: Small,\nwell-integrated teams collecting data for multiple summers\n(and arguing over analytical patterns each winter) in this\ncase accomplished more effective integration than a sin-\ngle, huge, multi-investigator project limited to a few sea-\nsons (the first of which tends to be inevitably spent in lo-\ngistic and coordination struggles). But however achieved,\nthe size of the different disciplinary data sets does matter\ngreatly; multiple site collections, large ecofact counts, and\nhundreds of soil profiles all provide the solid basis for cross-\ndisciplinary discussion and integration that is nearly impos-\nsible to achieve from a pastiche of small-scale, short-term\ninvestigations. If we are to successfully contribute to the ar-\nchaeology of global change, we need to develop structures\nof funding and research support that will promote similar\nsustained, long-term cooperative investigations with a clear\nlandscape focus.\nTHOMAS H.

We would like to thank the people of\nMy\u00b4vatnssveit and Hu\u00b4sav\u0131\u00b4k who have so kindly welcomed us and\nwho have so ably assisted the many seasons of investigation re-\nported here. Warm thanks are also owed to the international field\ncrews (drawn from 26 nations in total), whose hard work and resis-\ntance to black flies made the fieldwork possible. The students of the\nspecial NSF Office of Polar Programs Research Experience for Under-\ngraduates program run by Sophia Perdikaris from Brooklyn College\ndeserve special recognition for their hard work in both the field and\nlaboratory, and for their wonderful ability to adapt from inner-city\nto subarctic conditions.
