Introduction\nThe Canonbie area of southwest Scotland (Fig. 1) is\none of the few areas in the UK outside of the English\nMidlands where uppermost Carboniferous (Bolsovian\u2013\nAsturian) strata can be directly examined at outcrop.\nThe presence of red strata (including both primary\nand secondary red beds) in the \u2018Upper Coal Measures\u2019\nof the Canonbie area was noted by Peach & Horne\n(1903), Simpson & Richey (1936), Barrett & Richey\n(1945), Trotter (1953), Lumsden et al. (1967), Day\n(1970) and Picken (1988). Recent work by Jones,\nHolliday & McKervey (2010) on outcrops along the\nRiver Esk (Fig. 2) has shown that these strata can be\nassigned to the Warwickshire Group because the red-\nbed facies show evidence for early oxidation (primary\nreddening). The type area of theWarwickshire Group is\nthe Warwickshire Coalfield in central England (Fig. 1),\nwhere the succession attains its fullest thickness of\n1225 m (Powell et al. 2000) and typically comprises\nredmudstones and sandstones,with varying amounts of\npebbly sandstone, conglomerate, grey mudstone, thin\ncoals, lacustrine limestone (\u2018Spirorbis limestone\u2019) and\ncalcrete palaeosols. The Warwickshire Group ranges\nin age from late Bolsovian to Autunian, although\nthe degree of biostratigraphical control is reduced\ncompared with the Pennine Coal Measures Group\n\u2217Author for correspondence: a.c.morton@heavyminerals.fsnet.\nco.uk\n\u00a7Present address: Saudi Aramco, P.O. Box 2001, Dhahran 31311,\nSaudi Arabia\nbecause of the effects of reddening (Besly & Cleal,\n1997; Powell et al. 2000).\nThe Warwickshire Group in the Canonbie area\nhas been subdivided into three formations (Jones,\nHolliday & McKervey, 2010): the Eskbank Wood\nat the base, the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone, and\nthe Becklees Sandstone at the top (Fig. 3). The\nCanonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation is noteworthy\nbecause of the occurrence of thick units of medium-\nand coarse-grained cross-bedded channel sandstones\ndeposited by a series of northward-flowing braided\nriver systems. The sandstones in the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation are commonly micaceous and\ncontain abundant lithic grains, thereby resembling\nthe Halesowen Formation of central England and\nthe Pennant Sandstone Formation of South Wales\nand southern England (Jones, Holliday & McKervey,\n2010), which are known from isotopic studies to\nrepresent detritus sourced from the Variscan orogenic\nbelt to the south (Hallsworth et al. 2000; Sherlock,\nJones & Jones, 2000). The similarity between the Can-\nonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation and the Halesowen\nFormation is substantiated by heavy mineral and garnet\ngeochemical data (Jones, Holliday&McKervey, 2010).\nThe similarities in petrographical and heavy mineral\ncharacteristics between theCanonbieBridge Sandstone\nFormation, the Halesowen Formation and the Pennant\nSandstone Formation, together with evidence for\nnortherly directed palaeocurrents, led Jones, Holliday\n& McKervey (2010) to propose that the Canonbie\nBridge sandstones represent the products of a river\nsystem that drained the Variscides several hundreds\nVariscan sourcing of Westphalian sandstones in Canonbie Coalfield 719\nFigure 1.

If so, this would extend\nthe known northward distribution of Variscan-derived\nUpper Carboniferous sediment, the previous record\nbeing the Dalton Rock (Bolsovian) near Sheffield,\nYorkshire (Hallsworth et al. 2000).\nAlthough the evidence is compelling, the similarity\nin petrographical and mineralogical characteristics\nbetween the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation\nand known Variscan-sourced sandstones in central and\nsouthern England is not absolute proof that these\nsandstones have a common provenance. In this paper,\nwe report U\u2013Pb isotopic age dates of detrital zircons\nfrom a Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation sample,\nanalysed in order to test the possibility that Variscan-\nsourced sediment reached the Canonbie area during\nLate Carboniferous times.\n2. Geological background\nSedimentological and stratigraphical studies of the\nWarwickshire Group crop out along the River Esk\n(Fig. 2), together with borehole records from the\nCanonbie area, led Jones, Holliday&McKervey (2010)\nto subdivide the group into three units: the Eskbank\nWood, Canonbie Bridge Sandstone and Becklees\nSandstone formations (Fig. 4).\nThe EskbankWood Formation consists mostly of red\nmudstones, interbedded with fine- to medium-grained\nsandstones, calcrete palaeosols, thin beds of Spirorbis\nlimestone and Estheria-bearingmudstones. Sparse thin\ncoals (some of which have been oxidized and altered to\nlimestone) and grey mudstones are present in the lower\npart of the formation. The outcrop includes mudstones\nthat contain a fauna believed to diagnose the A. tenuis\nor A. prolifera non-marine bivalve zones of Trueman &\nWeir (1946), indicative of an Asturian age (Fig. 3). The\noutcrop section along the River Esk (Fig. 2) proves up\nto 75 m of the formation, but borehole records suggest\nthat the thickness of the formation ranges between 145\nand 175 m. The base of the formation, which is not\nexposed at outcrop and has therefore been defined in\nboreholes, is taken at the first major primary red-bed\nstrata overlying the grey mudstones that dominate the\nPennine Upper Coal Measures Formation (Fig. 3).\nThe overlying Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Form-\nation is dominated by reddish brown to greenish\ngrey, moderately to poorly sorted, fine- to coarse-\ngrained sandstones with a lithic arenite composition,\ninterbedded with reddish brownmudstones and reddish\nbrown mudstone palaeosols (including calcretes). The\nsandstones occur as sharp to erosively based, cross-\nbedded channel bodies, 10\u201330 m thick, in multi-\nstorey successions. In hand specimen, the sandstones\nare commonly micaceous and contain a noticeable\ncomponent of greenish grey grains. Thin-section\npetrography reveals that the greenish grey grains\nare lithic clasts, mainly comprising fine foliated or\nschistose low-grade metapelitic and metapsammitic\nfragments. The formation is well exposed along the\nRiver Esk between \u223c 250 m south and \u223c 600 m north\nof Canonbie Bridge (Fig. 2). Borehole records show\nthat the formation ranges in thickness from 131 to\n168 m. The sample reported in this paper (NJN100)\nwas taken at [339789 576088] (Fig. 2).\nThe Becklees Sandstone Formation comprises sand-\nstones with a subfeldspathic arenite composition,\ninterbedded with reddish brownmudstones and reddish\nbrown mudstone palaeosols (including calcretes). The\nsandstones are generally cross-bedded and occur as\nerosively based channel bodies, 10\u201330 m thick, in\nVariscan sourcing of Westphalian sandstones in Canonbie Coalfield 721\nFigure 4.

MORTON, M. FANNING & N. S. JONES\nmulti-storey units. In hand specimen, the sandstones\nare fine- to medium-grained, orange brown to bright\nreddish brown and pinkish brown, moderately to well\nsorted, typically lackmica, and contain low proportions\nof lithic clasts. At outcrop along the River Esk, the\nchange in lithology between the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation and the Becklees Sandstone\nFormation is abrupt, and is associated with sand-filled\npolygonal cracks penetrating the top of the Canonbie\nBridge Sandstone Formation. The change in com-\nposition, accompanied by a change in palaeocurrent\ndirection from northward-directed in the Canonbie\nBridge Sandstone Formation to southerly directed in\nthe Becklees Sandstone Formation, indicates a change\nin sediment provenance across the boundary. The top\nof the Becklees Sandstone Formation is truncated at\nthe sub-Permian unconformity and its full thickness is\ntherefore not known, but up to 200 m was proved in\nthe Becklees Borehole (Jones, Holliday & McKervey,\n2010).\n3. Analytical methods\nZircon grains were separated from sample NJN100\nusing standard crushing, washing, heavy liquid (Sp.\nGr. 2.96 and 3.3), and paramagnetic procedures. The\nzircon-rich heavy mineral concentrate was poured\nonto double-sided adhesive tape, mounted in epoxy\ntogether with chips of the reference zircons (TEMORA\nand SL13), sectioned approximately in half, and pol-\nished. Reflected light photomicrographs, transmitted\nlight photomicrographs and cathodoluminescence (CL)\nscanning electron microscope (SEM) images were\nprepared for all zircon grains. The CL images were\nused to decipher the internal structures of the sectioned\ngrains and to ensure that the \u223c 20 \u03bcm SHRIMP spot\nwas wholly within a single age component within the\nsectioned grains.\nThe U\u2013Th\u2013Pb analyses were made using SHRIMP\nRG at the Research School of Earth Sciences, The\nAustralian National University, Canberra, Australia.\nThe zircons on the mount were analysed sequentially\nand randomly until a total of 70 grains was reached.\nEach analysis consisted of five scans through the\nmass range, with a reference zircon analysed for every\nfive unknown zircon analyses, following the SHRIMP\nanalytical method recommended by Williams (1998\nand references therein). The data have been reduced\nusing the SQUID Excel Macro of Ludwig (2001).\nThe U\/Pb ratios have been normalized relative to\na value of 0.0668 for the TEMORA reference zircon,\nequivalent to an age of 417 Ma (Black et al. 2003).\nUncertainties given for individual analyses (ratios and\nages) are at the one sigma level (Table A1, in online\nAppendix at http:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/journals\/geo).\nCorrection for common Pb was made using the\nmeasured 204Pb\/206Pb ratio in the normal manner,\nexcept for grains younger than c. 800 Ma and for grains\nwith low U and, therefore, low radiogenic Pb, in which\ncase the 207Pb correction method was used (Williams,\nFigure 5. Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram displaying zircon\ncompositions from Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation\nsample NJN100 (n = 70). Data ellipses are 1\u03c3. Zircons that\nare > 20 % discordant or have otherwise unreliable apparent\nages are shown in black.\nFigure 6. Combined histogram\u2013relative probability plot of\nzircons from Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation sample\nNJN100 (n = 69 of which 63 are > 90 % concordant),\ngenerated using the AgeDisplay program (Sircombe, 2004).\nInset shows detail of the 250\u2013750 Ma age range and the\napproximate ages of the main peaks.\n1998). When the 207Pb correction is applied, it is not\npossible to determine radiogenic 207Pb\/206Pb ratios or\nages. In general, for areas younger than c. 800 Ma,\nand for areas that are low in U and therefore low\nin radiogenic Pb, the radiogenic 206Pb\/238U age has\nbeen used for the histogram and probability density\nplots. The 207Pb\/206Pb age is used for grains older than\n800 Ma, or for younger grains enriched in U.\n4. Zircon age population in the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation\nThe zircon age data from sample NJN100 are displayed\non a Tera & Wasserburg (1972) concordia plot\n(Fig. 5) generated using Isoplot\/Ex (Ludwig, 2003)\nand on a combined relative probability density\u2013stacked\nhistogram plot (Fig. 6), generated using AgeDisplay\n(Sircombe, 2004).\nVariscan sourcing of Westphalian sandstones in Canonbie Coalfield 723\nThe concordia plot shows that the majority of the\nzircons analysed are concordant or near-concordant.\nThe most obvious exceptions are grains 16.1 and 31.1,\nwhich are > 20 % discordant (Table A1, in online\nAppendix at http:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/journals\/geo),\nand grain 14.1, which lies slightly above concordia,\nis slightly enriched in common Pb, and yielded a\n206Pb\/238U age close to the Carboniferous\u2013Permian\nboundary (294\u00b1 7 Ma, \u00b1 1\u03c3). The Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation is believed to be Asturian\n(equivalent to theMoscovian: Heckel &Clayton, 2006)\nin age (Jones, Holliday & McKervey, 2010), and\nshould therefore be no younger than c. 306.5 Ma,\naccording to Gradstein, Ogg & Smith (2004). Grain\n14.1 has an apparent age c. 24 Ma younger than the\nmain Carboniferous group of zircons (Table A1), the\nyoungest of which is 318 Ma (Namurian). This age is\ntherefore considered suspect, and was not plotted on\nthe relative probability density\u2013histogram plot (Fig. 6).\nIt should be noted, however, that it does fall within\nerror of the youngest of the main group of zircons\nif the appropriate 2\u03c3 error (\u00b1 14 Ma) is applied. The\ngrain is probably a Carboniferous zircon that has lost a\nsmall amount of radiogenic Pb from the crystal lattice,\ncausing 238U\/206Pb to increase, thereby yielding an\nanomalously young apparent age.\nThe zircon age spectrum (Fig. 6) shows the presence\nof two major groups, together with a number of smaller\npeaks. The two main groups are late Neoproterozoic to\nearly Cambrian (693\u2013523 Ma) and Early Carbonifer-\nous (348\u2013318 Ma). The late Neoproterozoic to early\nCambrian peak comprises 31 of the 67 concordant or\nnear-concordant grains (46 % of the population), and\nappears to consist of two main groups, the larger one\npeaking at c. 568 Ma and the smaller one at c. 615 Ma.\nThe Early Carboniferous group is represented by 16\nzircons (24 % of the population), peaking at c. 326 Ma.\nIn addition, eight zircons (12 % of the population) are\nlate Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic in age\n(1119\u2013827 Ma), four (6 %) are late Palaeoproterozoic\nto early Mesoproterozoic (1712\u20131566 Ma), and four\n(6 %) are mid-Palaeoproterozoic (2042\u20131818 Ma).\nFinally, there are two zircons dated at 390\u2013396 Ma,\none at 1218 Ma, and one at 1365 Ma.\nMost of the Early Carboniferous zircons are euhedral\nor subhedral, with simple igneous oscillatory zoning\nunder CL (Fig. 7). Rare grains show more homogen-\neous CL that may reflect a metamorphic paragenesis.\nGrains with recognizable cores and overgrowths are\nscarce. Their habit and zonation patterns suggest\nthat most of the Early Carboniferous zircon grains\nrepresent first-cycle derivation from granitoids, which\naccords with the relatively short time gap between\ncrystallization and sedimentation.\nThe late Neoproterozoic\u2013early Cambrian zircons\nshow a wider range of habit, from euhedral to\nrounded. CL images ofmost grains show zoned igneous\ninternal structures (Fig. 7). A small proportion of\nlate Neoproterozoic\u2013early Cambrian zircons display\ncores and overgrowths, such as grain 8 (Fig. 7), which\nFigure 7.

It seems likely that many of these older\nzircons are recycled. Most have igneous zonation\npatterns (Fig. 7). Some of the Palaeoproterozoic to early\nNeoproterozoic zircons display cores and overgrowths.\nOne zircon (grain 70) has an irregular intricately zoned\nigneous core that has been partially resorbed and\/or\nreplaced by a bright CL, homogeneous overgrowth\n(Fig. 7). The overgrowth has comparatively low U\n(47 ppm) and very low Th (Table A1). The Th\/U ratio\nof \u2264 0.01, in conjunction with the habit, suggests that\nthe overgrowth may be of metamorphic origin.\n5. Discussion\nThe zircon population in sample NJN100 from the\nCanonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation unequivocally\nindicates that the sediment was derived from south of\nthe Variscan Front. This is diagnosed by the presence of\nthe two major age groups, Early Carboniferous (348\u2013\n318 Ma) and late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian\n(693\u2013523 Ma). The Early Carboniferous group\n724 A. MORTON, M. FANNING & N. S. JONES\ncorresponds to granitoid magmatism and associated\nmetamorphism in Brittany, dated as 345\u2013300 Ma\n(Brown & Dallmeyer, 1996), and in the Saxo-\nThuringian Zone of the central European Variscides,\nwhich ranges from 352 to 290 Ma (Tischendorf et al.\n1995). The late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian\ngroup corresponds to the Cadomian of Armorica\n(Guerrot & Peucat, 1990; Strachan, D\u2019Lemos &\nDallmeyer, 1996) and the central European Variscides,\nsuch as the Saxo-Thuringian Zone (Tischendorf et al.\n1995). Derivation from the north or west can be\ncategorically ruled out, since the zircon age structure\nin sample NJN100 contrasts strongly with that seen in\nnortherly or westerly derived Carboniferous sandstones\nin the Pennine Basin. The zircon populations in\nnortherly or westerly derived sandstones have\nArchaean, mid-Proterozoic and Silurian\u2013Devonian\nelements, indicating that their source regions lay in\nparts of Laurentia\u2013Baltica that were affected by the\nCaledonian orogeny (Hallsworth et al. 2000).\nThe zircon data therefore indicate that the Canonbie\nBridge sandstones represent the products of a river\nsystem that drained the Variscan orogenic belt several\nhundreds of kilometres to the south or southeast,\nproviding strong support for the suggestion made on\nthe basis of petrographical, heavy mineral and palaeo-\ncurrent evidence (Jones, Holliday &McKervey, 2010).\nThe zircon age structure of theHalesowen Formation of\nthe EnglishMidlands, which has similar petrographical\nand heavy mineral characteristics (Jones, Holliday\n& McKervey, 2010), is closely comparable to that\nseen in sample NJN100 (Fig. 8). The Halesowen\nzircon age spectrum contains two main groups (357\u2013\n323 Ma and 651\u2013534 Ma), comprising 38 % and 33%\nof the population, respectively. These peaks directly\nmatch the two main peaks in the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation, although the relative abundance\nof zircons in the two groups is somewhat different.\nThe other components of the Halesowen spectrum also\ncorrespond to those present in the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation (Fig. 8). There is little doubt that\nthe Halesowen Formation and the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation share a common provenance,\nand that their source area lay within the Variscides of\nwestern or central Europe.\nThe Dalton Rock (Bolsovian) near Sheffield, York-\nshire, and the Cleaver Formation (Duckmantian) of the\nsouthern North Sea also have zircon age populations\ndiagnosing derivation from the Variscides (Hallsworth\net al. 2000; Morton, Hallsworth & Claoue\u00b4-Long,\n2001;Morton, Hallsworth&Moscariello, 2005). These\nsandstones have bimodal zircon populations similar to\nthose in theCanonbieBridge Sandstone andHalesowen\nformations (Fig. 8), with Carboniferous and late\nNeoproterozoic to early Cambrian peaks.\nThere are two likely sources for these Variscan-\nderived sandstones: the Saxo-Thuringian Zone of\ncentral Europe and the Armorican Massif of Brittany.\nAs discussed above, both of these areas have Early\nCarboniferous granitoids intruding Cadomian crust.\nFigure 8. Comparison of detrital zircon age spectra from the\nCanonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation compared with other\nCarboniferous sandstones derived from the Variscides, adapted\nfrom Hallsworth et al. (2000) and Morton et al. (2001, 2005).\nIt is unlikely that Armorican-derived sediment could\nhave reached the Pennine Basin and southern North\nSea areas during the Duckmantian\u2013Bolsovian, since\nthe Wales-Brabant High was an area of positive\nrelief at that time (Besly, 1988; Cope et al. 1992).\nConsequently, the Cleaver Formation and Dalton Rock\nare believed to have been derived from the Saxo-\nThuringian Zone to the southeast (Morton, Hallsworth\n& Claoue\u00b4-Long, 2001; Morton, Hallsworth & Moscar-\niello, 2005). However, during the Asturian, there is\nevidence that the Wales-Brabant High was breached\n(Besly, 1988), a view supported by the similarity\nbetween the petrographical character of the Halesowen\nand Canonbie Bridge Sandstone formations (north of\nthe Wales-Brabant High) and the Pennant Sandstone\nFormation (south of the high), which suggests a\ncommon provenance for these sandstones. Hence, it\nis possible that sediment could have been introduced\nto the English Midlands and the Canonbie area from\nthe Armorican Massif through the breached Wales-\nBrabant High at this time (Hallsworth et al. 2000).\nHowever, Sherlock, Jones & Jones (2000) argued that\nBolsovian\u2013Asturian lithic arenites in the Forest of Dean\nBasin (south of the Wales-Brabant High) were derived\nfrom the central European Variscides.\nThere is heavy mineral evidence indicating that\nthe Dalton Rock and similar \u2018Mexborough-type\u2019\nsandstones had a different provenance to the\nHalesowen Formation, the former having higher\nmonazite:zircon (Hallsworth et al. 2000). It could\nVariscan sourcing of Westphalian sandstones in Canonbie Coalfield 725\nbe argued, therefore, that the Dalton Rock was\nderived from a different source to the Halesowen\nand Canonbie Bridge Sandstone formations (Saxo-\nThuringian as opposed to Armorican). However, it\ncan equally well be argued that the difference in\nmineralogy represents a change in the nature of\nthe lithologies available for erosion, for example,\nthrough uplift. This question therefore remains to be\nresolved.\nThe origin of the older Proterozoic zircons in\nthe Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation remains\nsomewhat equivocal. They could either represent older\ncrustal components within the Variscides, or be derived\nfrom sources outwith the Variscan belt. Most of\nthe peri-Gondwanan terranes in central and western\nEurope have a Palaeoproterozoic (c. 2.2\u20132.0 Ga)\nprotolith (Armorica, Saxo-Thuringia, Moldanubia),\nwith only the Moravian\u2013Silesian area having younger\n(c. 1.3\u20131.0 Ga) crust (Calvez & Vidal, 1978; Nance\net al. 2008). Hence, the older Palaeoproterozoic zircons\nin the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone and Halesowen\nformations, which extend back to > 2.0 Ga, could\nhave been derived from the western or central\nEuropean Variscides. The late Mesoproterozoic to\nearly Neoproterozoic group in the Canonbie Bridge\nSandstone Formation is approximately coeval with\nthe so-called \u2018Pentevrian\u2019 event (c. 900\u20131100 Ma),\nformerly believed to be the age of the Penthie`vre\nmassif in Brittany (Bishop, Roach & Adams, 1975),\nbut the significance of this event was subsequently\ncalled into question by Roach, Lees & Shufflebotham\n(1990). High-grade paragneisses in the Mid-German\nCrystalline Rise (adjacent to the Saxo-Thuringian\nZone) contain small numbers of c. 1.0 Ga zircons in\nassociation with dominant c. 550 Ma and c. 2.06 Ga\nzircons (Zeh et al. 2001). In the Massif Central of\nFrance, Visean volcanic rocks contain xenocrystic\nzircons dated as Mesoproterozoic, > 1.0 Ga (Bruguier\net al. 1998), approximately coeval with the late\nMesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic group in\nthe Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation. Therefore,\nthere is evidence to indicate that late Mesoproterozoic\nto early Neoproterozoic zircons could have been\nderived from basement rocks in the Variscides. It is also\npossible that earlyNeoproterozoic to Palaeoproterozoic\nzircons could have been recycled from sandstones\nwithin the Variscides. For example, Gerdes & Zeh\n(2006) and Linnemann et al. (2008) have estab-\nlished that early Neoproterozoic (c. 850 to 1000 Ma)\nand Palaeoproterozoic (c. 1700 to 2250 Ma) zircon\nage populations are present as detrital components\nwithin sandstones of the central European Variscides.\nTherefore, the only Proterozoic component of the\nzircon age spectrum that cannot be readily matched\nwith a source in the Variscides is that found at\nc. 1600 Ma. It is also possible to find a Variscan\nsource for the zircons dated as 390\u2013396 Ma, since this\ncorresponds to the subduction\u2013obduction cycle of the\nRheic and Galicia-Massif Central Palaeozoic oceans\n(Matte, 1986); furthermore, grains of this age have been\nfound in the Visean of the Massif Central (Bruguier\net al. 1998).\nFor the most part, therefore, the zircon population\nin the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation can be\nmatched with sources in the Variscides. However, it is\nalso possible that some detritus was supplied from non-\nVariscan sources traversed by the river system en route\nto the Canonbie area. Incorporation of a small amount\nof older northerly derived Carboniferous (Namurian)\nsediment is one possibility, since these sandstones\ncontain a wide range of mid-Proterozoic grains\nin conjunction with Silurian\u2013Devonian (Caledonian-\nage) zircons (Hallsworth et al. 2000). However, this\nmechanism should also introduce a small number of\nArchaean zircons, which does not appear to be the case,\nthe only possible exception being grain 15.1, which\nyielded an age of 2551\u00b1 10 Ma but is 24 % discordant.\nRecycling of northerly derived Old Red Sandstone is\nanother possibility, but cannot be tested owing to the\nabsence of zircon age data from theOldRed Sandstone.\n6. Conclusions\nThe zircon population in the Late Carboniferous\nCanonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation comprises\ntwo main peaks, one of Early Carboniferous age\n(348\u2013318 Ma), corresponding to the age of igneous\nactivity during the Variscan Orogeny, and one of late\nNeoproterozoic to early Cambrian age (693\u2013523 Ma),\ncorresponding to the Cadomian. Together, these two\ngroups comprise 70 % of the zircon population. These\ndata show unequivocally that most of the sediment\nwas derived from the Variscides of western or central\nEurope. The assemblage also contains a range of older\nProterozoic zircons, including a late Mesoproterozoic\nto early Neoproterozoic group (1119\u2013827 Ma), a late\nPalaeoproterozoic to early Mesoproterozoic group\n(1712\u20131566 Ma), and a mid-Palaeoproterozoic group\n(2042\u20131818 Ma), together with two Devonian grains.\nMost of these zircons can also be attributed to\nVariscan sourcing, the only exception being the c.\n1600 Ma group. However, it is also possible that\nsome of the late Mesoproterozoic to Palaeoproterozoic\nand Devonian zircons were locally derived through\nrecycling of northerly derived sandstones of Devonian\u2013\nCarboniferous age.\nThe Canonbie Bridge Sandstone Formation zircon\npopulation is closely comparable to those found in other\nVariscan-sourced sandstones from the UK Carbonifer-\nous, the coeval (Asturian) Halesowen Formation of the\nEnglish Midlands, the older Bolsovian Dalton Rock of\nYorkshire, and the Duckmantian Cleaver Formation of\nthe southern North Sea, as described by Hallsworth\net al. (2000), Morton, Hallsworth & Claoue\u00b4-Long\n(2001) and Morton, Hallsworth & Moscariello (2005).\nThe zircon age data confirm previous suggestions of\na Variscan source for the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nFormation, made on the basis of petrographical, heavy\nmineral and palaeocurrent evidence (Jones, Holliday\n& McKervey, 2010). This is the most northerly record\n726 A. MORTON, M. FANNING & N. S. JONES\nto date of Variscan-derived sediment in the UK,\nthe previous being the Bolsovian Dalton Rock of\nYorkshire. However, the sandstones at Canonbie are\nthick (channels 2\u201310 m thick in multi-storey units up\nto 50 m thick) and are believed to represent fairly\nextensive northerly flowing fluvial systems. Given their\nsize, it is thought likely that they would extend to at\nleast the Midland Valley of Scotland, and probably\nbeyond. Similar-aged successions are known locally\nfrom the Midland Valley (e.g. the Ayrshire Coalfield)\nand it is interesting to speculate about the provenance\nof sandstones in this area.\nPossible sources for the Canonbie Bridge Sandstone\nFormation and coeval Halesowen Formation are the\nArmoricanMassif of Brittany and the Saxo-Thuringian\nZone of the central European Variscides. Derivation\nfrom the former would require transport across the\nWales-Brabant High, which is believed to have been\nbreached by this time (Besly, 1988). The Saxo-\nThuringian Zone is believed to have supplied the earlier\nWestphalian Variscan-sourced sandstones (Morton,\nHallsworth & Claoue\u00b4-Long, 2001; Morton, Hallsworth\n& Moscariello, 2005), but these have different heavy\nmineral characteristics to the Asturian (Hallsworth\net al. 2000), implying they had a different provenance.\nHowever, this could either reflect a geographical shift\nin source or evolution of the lithological characteristics\nwithin the same source area, and cannot be taken as\nproof of Armorican versus central European sourcing.\nAcknowledgements.
