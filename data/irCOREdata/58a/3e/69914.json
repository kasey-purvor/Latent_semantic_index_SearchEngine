INTRODUCTION \nIn the production of steel strip, the temperature \ndistribution and cooling rates have a significant effect on the \nsteel microstructure and hence on final material properties, \nsuch as yield strength, tensile strength and ductility.  \nIncreasingly, steel customers require better materials in order \nto improve their own products and processing lines that use \nautomatic feeding or similar techniques. Consequently, \ndemands for higher product consistency and a greater \ndiversity of sophisticated steel grades have increased the \nrequirements for tighter control of process conditions and \nhence improved instrumentation.  The aim of this paper is to \ndescribe a new instrument to monitor the microstructure of \nsteel during controlled cooling on a hot strip mill. \nII. BACKGROUND  \nAn overview of the application is shown in Figure 1.   \nWhen hot steel strip leaves the last rolling stand, the structure \nis usually the high temperature, face-centered cubic austenite \nphase. As it cools, it transforms to a structure consisting of \nthe body centered cubic ferrite phase and carbide, usually \ncementite (Fe3C), the morphology of the latter depending on \ncooling rate and composition. Increasing the cooling rate or \nalloy content causes transformation to occur at lower \ntemperatures giving a finer carbide dispersion and hence a \nstronger product. By altering the final microstructures a wide \nrange of strengths can be produced in the strip product from \nvery low carbon essentially ferritic structures with tensile \nstrengths of about 200 N\/mm2 to high strength steels with \ntensile strengths in excess of 1000 N\/mm\n2\n. These have higher \ncarbon contents with microstructures consisting of mixtures \nof ferrite, pearlite, bainite, martensite and, in some cases, \nknown as TRIP steels, austenite which by suitable alloying \nhas been stabilized at temperatures down to ambient.  \n \nMill rolling stands CoilerControlled cooling\nTransformation sensors\n1 N\nTension load,\nTorque\nRoll gap\nSpeed\nThickness\nTemperature\nWidth, Shape,\nProfile\nTemperature\nFigure 1. The schematic diagram of a hot strip mill \nNon-contacting optical temperature sensors are typically \nused to implement feedback control of cooling.  \nUnfortunately, water spray variations and surface emissivity \nirregularities adversely affect these sensors.  The optical \npyrometers are therefore positioned outside the quenching \nzone and mathematical models are used to interpolate the \ncondition of the steel strip during cooling [1-3].  In addition, \ntemperature is only used as an assumed indicator of \nmicrostructure and only the surface of the steel is measured.  \nIdeally, the control of cooling path should take account of the \nprogress of dynamic transformation at a particular point \nrather than the strip temperature alone.  A transformation \nmonitoring system used in conjunction with optical \npyrometers would therefore represent a significant step \nforward. \nA number of approaches have been proposed and studied \nfor monitoring transformation on-line, including X-ray \ndiffraction [4], X-ray attenuation to monitor density change \n[5], ultra-sonic [6], thermal and magnetic.  It is well known \nthat the electromagnetic (EM) properties of steel change \nsignificantly as the material progresses through phase \ntransformation [7].  The austenitic phase is paramagnetic and \nthe ferritic phase is ferromagnetic below the Curie point, \nwhich is around 770 \no\nC but depends on the chemical \ncomposition of the steel.  The iron-carbon phase diagram, see \nFigure 2(a), shows the temperatures of the main \ntransformations versus the carbon content, when cooled very \nslowly.  Any austenite to ferrite transformation occurring \nbelow the Curie temperature may be detected by the \nferromagnetic transformation.  However, for Fe-C alloys with \n10910-7803-8879-8\/05\/$20.00 \u00a92005 IEEE\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The \nferrite thus formed remains paramagnetic and above the Curie \ntemperature this phase change would be difficult to detect \nmagnetically, unless very sensitive devices were used.  \nHowever, in practice, common alloying additions and \naccelerated cooling of the steel on the run-out tables of strip \nmills reduces the austenite-to-ferrite transformation \ntemperature to below the Curie temperature, in most cases, \nexcept at very low carbon contents.  For example, Figure 2(b) \nshows a continuous cooling transformation diagram for a \n0.74%C steel where even at very slow cooling rates (e.g. 0.4 \no\nC\/s) transformation from austenite does not take place above \n700 \no\nC.  The phase change is indicated by the bump in the \ntemperature plots caused by the release of the latent heat of \ntransformation. Thus, micro-structural changes can be \ndetected and monitored on-line using magnetic sensors.  \nPhase transformations have been previously studied using \nthermal analysis techniques [8] and more widely by \ndilatometry but these are essentially laboratory techniques \nand are not suitable for on-line use. \n300\n400\n600\n700\n800\n500\n1000\n900\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\nTemperature 0C\nCarbon %\nFerrite\nAustenite\nCurie temp.\nFerrite + cementite\nFerrite + austenite\n      \n(a) \nPearlite\nMartensite\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\n900\nT\ne\nm\np\ne\nra\ntu\nre\n (\n0\nC\n)\n0.1 1 10 100 1000Time (s)\nCooling rate (0C\/s)\nbetween 800 0C & 500 0C 4\n1\n7\n3\n0\n0\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n6\n8\n5\n.5\n6\n4\n.0\n3\n8\n.6\n2\n9\n.1\n1\n4\n.6\n8\n.2\n1\n8\n.6\n4\n.2\n2\n.5\n1\n.3\n0.7\n0.4\n(b) \nFigure 2. Transformation data.  a) Fe-C phase diagram  (b) Continuous \ncooling transformation diagram for a 0.74% C steel \nThe electromagnetic approach has several potential \nadvantages.  The magnetic field is unaffected by water and \nany non-magnetic, non-conductive material used to protect \nthe sensor.  In addition, the field acts at a distance and \nrequires no contact with the hot strip. There are several \nreports of the successful use of electromagnetic sensors to \nmonitor transformation both in the laboratory and on the run-\nout table [9-17].  These systems used either DC or a single \nexcitation frequency.  Consequently, separate measurements \nare required to compensate for variations in the distance (or \nlift-off) between the sensor and strip steel.  The multi-\nfrequency approach in the paper allow the phase signature of \nthe signal spectrum to be used directly, which has been \nshown to be approximately lift-off independent. The \nanalytical treatment of the topic is dealt with in a separate \npaper by Yin et al [18]. \n Recently, research has also been focused the underlying \nrelationship between the microstructure of the steel and the \nelectromagnetic response.  In particular, the sensor output has \nbeen shown to have a monotonic, non-linear response to the \nratio of transformed ferrite, which is dependant on the \nmorphology of the ferromagnetic phase [19].  Finite element \nsimulation at the microstructure level has also been used to \nmodel the experimental results [20].  Surface conditions of \nthe steel such as the presence of decarburization can \nsignificantly affect the response of the sensor [21] although in \npractice on a full scale mill this is not considered to present a \ndifficultly as the surface will not have time to react with the \natmosphere before being cooled. \nIII. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION \nAn overview of the system is shown in Figure 3. The \nacquisition system contains a digital signal processor (DSP), \nimpedance measuring circuitry and a sensing head.  The DSP \nhas dedicated on-board firmware, which operates in response \nto commands received via a serial link from the host \ncomputer.  The DSP controls the measurement process and \ncan generate a composite excitation waveform containing up \nto 8 frequencies in a binary sequence.  The excitation \nwaveform is fed to the sensing head via a digital-to-analogue \nconverter (DAC) and buffer amplifier.  The impedance \nmeasurements are achieved using two analogue-to-digital \nconverters (ADC\u2019s), one for measuring the excitation current \nand one measuring the detected voltage.  An important design \nissue is the ability to measure a small impedance change \nsuperimposed on a large background, which is often the case \nin electrical tomography.  Consequently, a second ADC is \nused to null the background signal.  \n \n1092\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

The magnetic head before encapsulation (a) and the main elements \nof the magnetic sensing head (b) \nMulti-frequency impedance analysis is performed by \nexciting the sensing head with a composite waveform \ncontaining the required harmonics, each at a nominal phase \nand magnitude.  The actual excitation current and the flux \nsensing coils' voltages are sampled and analyzed by the DSP \nusing a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to extract the harmonic \nphase and magnitude information, from which associated \nimpedances are calculated.  To maximize the dynamic range \nof the system, it is necessary to null the background voltage \nfrom active sensing element's output voltage.  The \nbackground voltage can be several orders of magnitude \ngreater than the desired signal from the steel and must be \ncarefully removed.  A three-tier approach is used.  First, most \nof the unwanted voltage is removed by subtracting the output \nvoltage from head's dummy sensing element from that of the \nactive head using a magnetic bridge configuration as \ndescribed above. Second, the residual voltage, which is \ncaused by differences between the active and dummy sides of \nthe sensor, is subtracted using a compensation waveform \ngenerated from a second ADC. A multi-frequency \ncompensation waveform is required as the residual has \nfrequency dependent magnitude and phase errors.  Finally, \nany further residual of the background signal is subtracted in \nsoftware. \nThe compensation waveform was determined in the \nfollowing three stages. \n1. The magnitude and phase response of the sensor was \nmeasured,  \n2. The response of the compensation channel was \ndetermined, \n3.    The required compensation wave was calculated.  \nThe purpose of the first stage is to characterize the \nfrequency magnitude and phase response of the entire active-\ncompensation loop. This loop starts at the active \ncompensation DAC's output and passes through the input-\nsumming amplifier, gain amplification stages and filtering \nand ends at the head voltage sensing ADC (analogue to \ndigital converter) as shown in Figure 3.

RESULTS \nThree sets of steel samples of compositions given in Table \n1 and dimension 137mm x 87mm x 2mm were investigated in \norder to verify the effects of phase transformations and \nchanges in lift-off.  Each sample was heated to 1000 \no\nC and \nthen placed over the sensor and allowed to cool in free air.   \nTable 1: Compositions of steels under investigation \n COMPOSITION (% wt) \nSample C Si Mn P S \nLow Carbon (A) 0.09 0.02 0.94 0.017 0.003 \nMedium carbon \n(B) \n0.44 0.25 0.81 0.017 0.005\nHigh Carbon (C) 0.68 0.22 0.74 0.009 0.001 \n \nThe samples were thermally insulated within a 1 cm thick \nDuratec enclosure, which provided a slow controlled cooling \nrate (<1 oC\/s), hence near equilibrium transformation was \nobtained. The measured temperature uniformity across a \nsample was less than 10 oC. \nTwo plots of the changes in the measured impedance \nversus temperature for the low carbon (A) and high carbon \n(C) samples are shown in Figure 5 for a lift-off of 51 mm.  \nEach graph contains 8 curves for excitation frequencies \nranging from 781 Hz to 100 kHz in a binary sequence of \nvalues, as indicated in the legend.   \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure 5.  Changes in the measured trans-impedance (ohms) versus \ntemperature (oC) for the low carbon (a) and high carbon (b) samples \nFor the low carbon sample (A), the curves all display a \nsteep rise at the Curie temperature, TC, which is the point \nwhere the material becomes ferromagnetic. After this \ntransformation, (i.e. below 700 \no\nC) the low frequency curves \n(e.g. 781 Hz) are relatively flat. As the frequency increases \nand samples cool, the curves reduce in value because the \ninterrogating EM field cannot diffuse as deeply into the strip.  \nThe depth of penetration, \u03b4 to approximately e-1 of the surface \nvalue, is governed by the skin depth equation, \n\u03c3\u03c9\u00b5\n\u03b4\n\u22c5\u22c5\n=\n2\n \n(4)\n \nwhere \u00b5 is the magnetic permeability and \u03c3 is the \nelectrical conductivity of the sample and \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f is the \nangular frequency. As the sample cools, both conductivity \nand permeability increase and consequently the interrogating \nfield can only penetrate less of the thickness of the sample.  \nThis effect is more pronounced for higher frequencies. \n1094\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

Restrictions apply.\nFor the high carbon sample (C), the curves show the same \ntrends, but with the addition of a second transformation at the \neutectoid temperature (680 oC), caused by the presence of the \ncarbon.  This effect is shown in more detail in Figure 6, with \na lift-off of 51 mm and an excitation frequency of 21.5 kHz.  \nFigure 6.Influence of carbon composition upon imaginary impedance Z\u201d at \n12.5 KHz \n Sample A shows an increase in the impedance at TC (~ \n770 \no\nC).  Due to its low carbon content, this sample is \nexpected to transform fully to ferrite above TC, so here the \nsensor is detecting the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic \ntransformation.  Samples B and C contain more carbon (0.44 \nand 0.68 % wt respectively) and are expected to transform to \na mixed ferrite and pearlite microstructure, with the majority \nof the ferrite forming above TC and the pearlite forming at the \neutectoid temperature, TE, (~723 \no\nC at equilibrium, but \nsuppressed to ~680 oC by the cooling rate used).  The higher \ncarbon content of the sample C results in a higher pearlite and \nby implication lower ferrite content.  Hence a larger expected \nZ\u201d response at TE and a lower Z\u201d change at TC as shown in \nFigure 6. Differences in measured impedance therefore imply \ndiscrimination between steels of varying carbon composition, \nas seen in previous work [19]. \nThe effect of lift-off is shown in Figure 7, which plots the \nmagnitude of the trans-impedance change (in \u2126) and change \nin phase (deg.) versus both temperature (oC) and lift-off \n(mm).  Changes in magnitude are shown on the left hand side \nand phase changes are shown on the right, with an excitation \nfrequency of 32 kHz.  These curves were obtained by testing \na series of samples cut from adjacent positions on the sample \nand therefore with virtually identical material properties.  \nLift-off distances of between 42 and 70mm were considered \nin 3mm increments.  Each sample was only used for one hot \ntest.  The effect of lift-off is generally to simply scale the size \nof the magnitude, the larger the lift-off the smaller the signal.  \nHowever, lift-off has little effect on the phase response as \nthese curves are virtually constant in this direction.  This was \nfound to be the case for all the measured frequencies, which \nsuggests that the phase signature of the trans-impedance is \napproximately lift-off independent.  The theoretical basis of \nthis result is treated in a complementary paper [18]. \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n1095\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Lancaster University Library.

CONCLUSIONS \nThis paper has described the design and operation of an \ninstrument to analyze the phase transformations of hot strip \nsteel using electromagnetic interrogation.  The instrument \nuses a novel multi-frequency excitation method to monitor \nthe micro-structural changes.  The paper has shown that the \ninstrument can successfully detect transformation at both the \nCurie and Eutectoid temperatures.  Furthermore, the sensor is \nable to discriminate the response between steels of varying \ncarbon composition.  The measurements presented in the \npaper confirm the phase response of the sensor is virtually \nlift-off independent. This is the first time this result has been \nreported with tests on hot steel samples. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nThe authors wish to express their gratitude to EPSRC \nand for its financial support of this project.  \nREFERENCES \n[1]  (NISI ) Nissan Steel KK, \u201cControlling Phase Transformation in Coiled \nHot Rolled Steel Strip by Monitoring Temp. on Leaving Hot Rolling \nMill and Applying Cooling Water in Computer Calculated Amount\u201d,  \nWPI Acc.
