Furthermore,  the  TQQ  can  be  used  to\nscreen for moderately\/severely impaired children in re-\nsource-poor countries; however, the low positive predic-\ntive values mean that other assessments are required for\nconfirmation.\nCopyright \u00a9 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel\nBackground\nThere are few studies on the prevalence of neurological\nimpairment (NI) in children in resource-poor countries,\nyet most of the neurological disorders are thought to occur\nin these areas [1]. In this region, identification of children\nwith NI is difficult, since the major sources of referral\nused in western countries, i.e. schools and medical ser-\nvices, do not provide enough information to detect im-\npairment [2]. Other techniques such as national census\ninterviews or key informant techniques often underesti-\nmate the number of children with NI [3].\nA \u2018Ten Questions\u2019 Questionnaire (TQQ) was devel-\noped to rapidly screen children aged 2\u20139 years for several\ntypes of impairment. Studies have been reported from\nJamaica, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh [4\u20139],\nbut the use of the TQQ in other continents has not been68 Neuroepidemiology 2004;23:67\u201372 Mung\u2019ala-Odera\/Meehan\/Njuguna\/Mturi\/\nAlcock\/Carter\/Newton\nTable 1.

As part of a study to identify children\nwith NI in a rural Kenyan community, we assessed the\nvalidity and reliability of the TQQ as a tool for identifying\nchildren with moderate to severe NI (table 1).\nMethods\nStudy Setting\nThis study was conducted in a demarcated study area in the Kilifi\nDistrict on the coast of Kenya. The area is subdivided into 87 enu-\nmeration zones, with sketch maps of each zone drawn in 1992 and\nupdated in 2000, showing major landmarks, footpaths and home-\nsteads, with their relative positions and survey numbers (fig. 1). The\nsketch maps were used to relocate each household both during the\ncensus in October 2000 and the NI survey between June 2001 and\nMarch 2002.\nPopulation\nA study population of 10,218 children aged 6\u20139 years was drawn\nfrom a population of about 100,000 people. This rural population\nconsists mainly of the Mijikenda ethnic group, in which the Giriama\nsubgroup predominates. This age group was chosen because it is\nmore difficult to identify impairments in children younger than 6\nyears (particularly hearing and visual impairment), and due to the\nlack of culturally appropriate cognitive assessment tools for children\nbelow 6 years of age. Furthermore, since one of the aims of this study\nwas to identify acquired NI, the most likely causes (bacterial menin-\ngitis and cerebral malaria) will only have occurred by the age of 6\nyears. Children in this age group were identified through the census\nconducted in October 2000. Only children who had been residing in\nthe area for at least 6 months preceding the survey were included.\nTQQ Screening Instrument\nThe TQQ consists of 10 questions (Appendix 1): 1 each address-\ning the child\u2019s vision, hearing, movement and seizures, 6 on cogni-\ntion competence, and 1 extra question regarding other serious health\nproblems. The questionnaire was translated into Kigiriama and back\nto English to ensure the intended meaning remained the same, before\nbeing used. A screening test was considered positive if there was a\npositive response to any one of the 10 questions.\nPilot Survey\nA pilot survey was performed on 102 children who had earlier\nundergone both neurological and cognitive impairment as part of\nanother study investigating the impact of malaria and seizures on\nepilepsy [Carter et al., in prep.]. Twenty-nine (28%) of these children\nhad impairments.\nInitially, 45% of the children tested positive on the TQQ, with\nglobal sensitivity and specificity values for any impairment of 47 and\n55%, respectively. We explored the reasons for the highly positive\nresult by checking the Kigiriama translation and the inter-interview-\ner administration of the questionnaire. In 4 focus group surveys, with\n28 mothers from the community, questions 1, 3 and 4 were found to\nhave been misunderstood. In question 1, the difficulty occurred in\nthe concept of delay in developmental milestones. In this communi-\nty, mothers tend to compare their child\u2019s development with those of\nother siblings; for instance, walking at the age of 11 months might not\nbe  a  significant  delay;  however,  a  mother  whose  other  children\nwalked by the age of 8 months may consider this a delayed milestone.\nIn question 3, a direct translation of the question to the local dialect\nresulted in two interpretations pertaining to hearing and inattention\n(an  inattentive  child).  The  Kigiriama  translation  was  therefore\nrevised to reflect the aspect of hearing alone. Likewise, question 4\nhad two interpretations: the child\u2019s understanding of simple instruc-\ntions and a behavioral aspect (obeying of instructions).\nAfter the revision, the questionnaire was again piloted on guar-\ndians of 439 children aged 6\u20139 years, before being administered to\nthe target population. Eleven percent of the children tested positive,\nwith  questions  1  and  3  accounting  for  most  of  the  positive  re-\nsponses.\nStudy Design\nTo test the validity of the TQQ, a two-stage design was followed.\nStage one involved the screening of the entire population of children\naged 6\u20139 years residing in the study area, using the TQQ tool. In\nstage two, all the children testing positive on the TQQ underwent\ncomprehensive clinical and psychological assessments. Based uponDetection of Neurological Impairment in\nChildren Aged 6\u20139 Years in Rural Kenya\nNeuroepidemiology 2004;23:67\u201372 69\nFig. 1. Country and area of the study.\nthe pilot data and estimates from other studies [4\u20138], we chose to\nselect every twelfth child who tested negative on the questionnaire to\nundergo similar assessments. The assessments focused on detecting\nimpairments of vision, hearing, motor, and cognition, and the diag-\nnosis of epilepsy. Assessments were performed within 1 week of the\nscreening. None of the clinicians and assessors involved in the study\nknew the result of the TQQ screen at the time of the examination.\nHousehold Screening\nFive trained field interviewers fluent in Kigiriama performed the\nhousehold screening after undergoing a week\u2019s training in field meth-\nods and questionnaire administration. The fieldworkers adminis-\ntered the TQQ to the guardians of between 80 and 100 children on\neach day. All those with at least 1 positive response and an equal\nnumber of children testing negative were referred to the research cen-\nter for detailed assessment.\nPsychological and Neurological Assessment\nA team of 3 clinicians and 5 psychosocial assessors performed\nassessments. The assessments included a vision test, with the Sonk-\nsen-Silver Acuity system for measuring acuity distance [10]. Hearing\nwas measured with a Kamplex screening audiometer to establish the\nhearing thresholds of the children. The thresholds were measured at\n500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz [11]. Finally, motor impairments\n(clinical examination) were assessed. The diagnosis of epilepsy was\nbased upon history elicited by clinicians, and an electroencephalo-\ngram used to classify the type of epilepsy. The electroencephalogram\nwas performed on children who had a history of epilepsy (more than\n1 seizure), with at least 1 seizure within the last 12 months, or had\npartial  seizures.  Local  adaptations  of  assessments  of  cognition,\nspeech and language were used. The cognitive assessment involved a\n7-item battery, which included \u2018Panga Mutu\u2019 (testing intellectual and\ndevelopmental maturity of a child through observing how a child\ndeploys a set of basic skills to represent his\/her knowledge of the\nhuman form) [12], a local adaptation of the matching familiar figures\n(assessing information processing speed and impulsivity) [13], digit\nspan (auditory short-term memory) [14], a construction task using\nwooden sticks (simultaneous processing, visuomotor coordination,\nvisuospatial perception and reasoning) [15], category fluency (execu-\ntive function) [14], information questions [15] and picture vocabula-\nry test (receptive vocabulary, verbal comprehension, achievement\nand association of pictures and words) [15]. The speech and language\nassessment battery included measures of comprehension, expression\nand the child\u2019s phonological system [16]. The neurological assess-\nment involved eliciting birth, developmental and medical history,\nclinical and physical examination and observation of function and\nanthropometric measurement (height, weight, head and mid-upper\narm circumferences).70 Neuroepidemiology 2004;23:67\u201372 Mung\u2019ala-Odera\/Meehan\/Njuguna\/Mturi\/\nAlcock\/Carter\/Newton\nTable 2.

Impairment-specific interpretations [8]\nwere adopted, in which a child with a given impairment had to be\npositive for at least 1 screening question specific to that impairment\nin order to be considered a true-positive. For example, a child with a\ncognitive impairment has to test positive for at least 1 question on\ncognitive competence for him\/her to be considered to have a cogni-\ntive impairment.\nSensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values\nwere calculated to measure the validity of the TQQ [17]. Cohen\u2019s\nkappa scores were used to measure the test-retest reliability [17].\nResults\nA total of 10,218 children were screened, of whom 955\n(9.3%) were positive (table 2). Delayed milestones and\nhearing problems were the most common types of prob-\nlems reported, while learning and visual problems were\nthe least reported (table 2). There was no difference be-\ntween the sexes in those screened.\nIn total, 1,576 underwent assessment, and 810 (51.4%)\nof them were those who tested positive on the TQQ. Half\nof these children were (51.4%) boys. Overall the sensitivi-\nty of the TQQ to detect the different impairments (mod-\nerate\/severe and severe only) was greater than or equal to\n70% for all domains, with lowest for cognitive impair-\nment (70.0%) and highest for epilepsy (100%; table 3). In\nthis  study,  specificities  were  high  (171%)  for  all  the\nimpairments; however, positive predictive values (PPV)\nwere  low.  There  was  a  difference  in  sensitivity  rates\nbetween boys and girls in the cognition (63.4 vs. 48.1%)\nand motor (66.7 vs. 80.0%) domains.\nIn total, 322 (20%) of the children assessed had some\nform of impairment. Twenty percent of them were those\nwho tested negative on the TQQ. From this group (false-\nnegatives) 45% were aged 7 years and 66.2% were fe-\nmales. The associated impairments for the false-negatives\nwere cognition in 70.9% of the children, epilepsy in 24.6%\nand hearing and vision in 4.5%.\nReliability of the TQQ\nThe test-retest reliability of the TQQ was excellent for\nquestions on vision, motor, seizures, speech and 4 of the\nquestions on cognition (table 2). It was fair on the general\nquestions about developmental milestones and hearing.\nPsychological and Clinical Assessments\nThe interrater agreement of the clinical examinations\nwas good (kappa 0.40\u20130.75), with that of epilepsy being\nexcellent (kappa = 0.78). For the cognitive and language\ntests, the statistical measurements of interrater reliability\nwere at an acceptable level of congruence between asses-\nsors, with the mean difference in scores being less than\n10% of the mean score [18].\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates that the TQQ is reliable and\nuseful for detecting moderate\/severe impairment in chil-\ndren aged 6\u20139 years in rural Africa. The high sensitivity\nensures that most cases of NI are identified, while the very\nhigh  specificity  means  that  resources  can  be  targeted\ntowards assessing these children. The low PPV suggests\nthat a large number of the children who screen positive on\nthe TQQ are false-positives for moderate or severe im-\npairment. Many of these children may have mild impair-\nments. This suggests that the TQQ alone is insufficient for\nuse in case finding in epidemiological studies of severe\nimpairment, but still remains useful as a screening tool in\nselecting cases for further assessment.\nUnlike in the other studies where only 6\u201310% of chil-\ndren who screened negative were evaluated, findings from\nour study are stronger in that an equivalent number of\nthose that screened negative were evaluated [4\u20138]. These\nstudies  had  comparable  sensitivities  for  cognition  andDetection of Neurological Impairment in\nChildren Aged 6\u20139 Years in Rural Kenya\nNeuroepidemiology 2004;23:67\u201372 71\nTable 3.

All these studies used impairment-specific inter-\npretation of the data. The differences in the sensitivity\nand specificity could have been caused by different cultur-\nal perceptions of impairment, differences in the develop-\nment of the questionnaire or population groups (rural vs.\nurban). It is clear that the TQQ does require considerable\ndevelopment, piloting and reliability tests before being\nutilized.\nVision, hearing and cognitive impairments are often\nunderreported by parents [19]. In our study, the TQQ was\nable to detect moderate\/severe impairments in vision and\nhearing.  The  low  sensitivity  for  detection  of  cognitive\nimpairment may have arisen from the poor reliability of\nquestion number 1 on the child\u2019s development. Further-\nmore, the assessments of cognitive impairment were not\ncomprehensive,  but  were  developed  to  test  the  main\ndomains of cognition within an hour. A more detailed\nassessment of cognition may indicate that the TQQ has a\nhigher sensitivity for cognitive impairment.\nReliability data for the TQQ were shown to be consis-\ntent over time for all the questions except for the ques-\ntions  on  milestones  (question  number  1)  and  hearing\n(question number 3) where the reliability was fair [17].\nThe lower level of reliability on the hearing question may\nhave been due to misunderstandings about the nature of\npersisting hearing impairment, within this culture, partic-72 Neuroepidemiology 2004;23:67\u201372 Mung\u2019ala-Odera\/Meehan\/Njuguna\/Mturi\/\nAlcock\/Carter\/Newton\nularly parents\u2019 perception of a child\u2019s inattention com-\npared  with  actual  deafness.  Furthermore,  fluctuating\nhearing levels due to ear infections or upper respiratory\ntract infections may have contributed to this result. How-\never, the results suggest that the TQQ is a reliable tool, a\nfinding  that  was  also  demonstrated  by  the  Pakistani\nstudy,  which  established  reliability  coefficients  in  the\nrange of 0.6\u20130.8 [20].\nWe have found that the TQQ is a useful screen for\nmoderate\/severe NI in epidemiological studies of children\nbecause of its ability to identify more than 70% of the\nseriously  impaired  children.  However,  the  low  PPV\nmeans that it should not be used alone to detect such\nimpairments.\nAppendix 1\nThe \u2018Ten Questions\u2019 Questionnaire\n(1) Compared with other children, did the child have any serious\ndelay in sitting, standing or walking?\n(2) Compared with other children, does the child have difficulty\nin seeing, either in the daytime or at night?\n(3) Does the child appear to have difficulty in hearing?\n(4) When you tell the child to do something, does he\/she seem to\nunderstand what you are saying?\n(5) Does the child have difficulty in walking or moving his\/her\narms or does he\/she have weakness and\/or stiffness in the arms or\nlegs?\n(6) Does the child sometimes have fits, become rigid, or lose con-\nsciousness?\n(7) Does the child learn to do things like other children of his\/her\nage?\n(8) Does the child speak at all (can he\/she make himself\/herself\nunderstood in words; can he\/she say some recognizable words)?\n(9) Is the child\u2019s speech in any way different from normal (not\nclear enough to be understood by people other than his\/her imme-\ndiate family)?\n(10) Compared with other children of his\/her age, does the child\nappear in any way mentally backward, dull or slow?\nAcknowledgements\nThe Wellcome Trust, UK and Kenya Medical Research Institute\n(KEMRI) supported this study.
