I was (and am) also a feminist, and there was a\nperiod when it seemed politically urgent to bring these commitments and\nenthusiasms together\u2014in one\u2019s work and practice. That moment has, I\nthink, passed\u2014to a degree because many of the battles have been won.\nBut in different ways and to various degrees that moment has been for-\nmative of the disciplines of film and media studies, shaping their content\nand conduct as well as the habits of thought of those of all genders and\ngenerations who work in those fields.\nThis change of consciousness goes beyond the academy, too: themes\nand motifs in films that might thirty years ago have seemed commonplace\nor gone unremarked (women in peril, say) are treatable on screen today,\nif at all, only ironically or in some other distanced manner. If we choose\nto be optimistic about the impact of our work, we may conclude that this\nis a measure of the consciousness-raising potential of scholarship and\nteaching. At the same time, if the political energy that brought about\nthese changes is still there, it seems to require less proclamation. So if in\nmy own work feminism is still a sine qua non, it seems less necessary, less\nurgent, to say so. It is built in, can be taken for granted.\nCinema and film remain my main areas of interest, and I am aware that\nthese have changed in all sorts of ways since I first got involved in film\nstudies. Nonetheless, the seductiveness of \u201cnew media\u201d notwithstanding,\nI think it would be unwise to lose sight of the idea of film as a distinctive\nmedium. Of course the nature of film\u2019s distinctiveness does not stay con-\nstant\u2014this is something to be charted and explored. Film studies is a\ndifferent discipline from what it was in the 1970s (and media studies\nscarcely existed then), and here I would like to explore three areas in\nwhich both disciplines seem to me to be evolving and to look at the issues\n1222 \u2759 Kuhn\naround feminism in each of them. If I focus my discussion largely on film\nand cinema, this is not just because these are the areas with which I am\nmost familiar but also because I think there are significant issues of media\nspecificity here, and I want to avoid conflating different media. The three\nareas are: the ontology, aesthetics, and metapsychology of film; cultural\nstudies of cinema (and other media); and social histories of cinema (and\nother media). I shall concentrate mainly on the first and offer some brief\nconcluding remarks on the other two.\nThe ontology, aesthetics, and metapsychology of film\nThere is a distinction to be made straight away between film and cinema.\nI use the term film to refer to the distinctive textual features of the medium.\nBy cinema I mean the entire industry or apparatus of cinema, that is, film\ntexts along with the contexts and manner in which they are produced and\nconsumed.\nInspired by the novelty of this very modern medium, the earliest\ntheorists of film were keen to pinpoint what was different and distinctive\nabout it and thus directed their inquiries at the ontology, the essential\nnature, of film and also at film\u2019s aesthetics (see, e.g., Bala\u00b4zs 1970). Later\ntheorists expanded ontological concerns into metapsychological studies\u2014\nexplorations of the distinctiveness of film\u2019s address to its spectators, of the\nrelationship between the film text and the subjectivity of the spectator\n(Metz 1982). Are we at risk now of losing sight of the aesthetic and\nmetapsychological distinctiveness of film\u2014even if this is very different\ntoday from what it might have been in the medium\u2019s earlier years?\nThe task of theory is to illuminate its objects, and vice versa. Film\ntheory should help us make sense of film, and films ought to be the\ngrounding and the inspiration for film theory. In an essay from the late\n1980s on the then-current state of feminist film theory, I wrote that\ntheories of film do not translate automatically to other media (Kuhn\n1989). This, I think, is still true. We need to take the objects, not the\ntheory, as the starting point for our thinking and allow ourselves to learn\nfrom them in all their specificity, whether they be film, television, video,\nor whatever else. This is one reason why the idea of \u201capplying\u201d theory\nmakes me uneasy: it feels rather a constraining, procrustean sort of exercise\nand rarely produces convincing or helpful results.\nWe are asked to consider whether psychoanalytic theory still has any-\nthing to offer feminist inquiry into the media. Psychoanalysis was used\nfirst of all in relation to film (as opposed to other media), and as I see it\nfeminist psychoanalytic film theory sprang from two rather different de-\nS I G N S Autumn 2004 \u2759 1223\nsires: to understand the nature of film, in particular its metapsychology,\nin relation to sexual difference; and to understand how gender informs\nthe contents of films and\/or how men and women relate to film and\/or\ncinema.\nThese desires come together in thinking on how psychoanalytic ideas\non the production of sexual difference may contribute to a more general\nunderstanding of the interaction between films and those who watch them.\nIn practice, however, they pull in opposing directions. The central pre-\noccupations of the first do not readily map onto gender or other identity\npolitics, in part because of the polymorphous range of subjectivities in the\ninternal world. Feminine subjectivity is not the same as femaleness, and\nmale subjectivity is not the same as maleness, and in the psyche many\nmore subjectivities even than these are potentially available. More im-\nportantly, perhaps, psychoanalysis is as much, or more, concerned with\nthe internal world of the psyche as it is with the external world of politics\nand social action. It is not that these worlds are separate and unrelated\nso far as psychoanalysis is concerned. Rather, they are different from each\nother, and it is the job of psychoanalysis to explore and explain their\ninterrelation in particular cases rather than to assume it. The second desire\nsprings from a more overtly political debate about women (or men) as\nthey appear in films and\/or constitute an audience for them. For the sake\nof brevity, I shall call the two tendencies, respectively, \u201cpsychoanalytic\u201d\nand \u201csocial.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, these two tendencies constantly seem to anger or\ndisappoint each other. For many feminists, the \u201cpsychoanalytic\u201d tendency\nseems abstruse and unrelated to the \u201creal world,\u201d a judgment scarcely\nmitigated by the difficulty of some of the writing in this area. Many have\nfelt excluded from this debate, and such feelings generate resentment\nalong with lack of understanding. Even those like myself who find psy-\nchoanalytic theory enormously helpful in thinking about film (and indeed\nabout culture more generally) can struggle with this. As well, at a certain\nperiod, happily now past, a demand for compliance seemed to be in the\nair, especially around acceptance of the work of Jacques Lacan. This is\nthe very sort of thing that makes people feel inadequate, and I certainly\nstill have difficulty finding some of Lacan\u2019s work, particularly that around\nsexual difference, convincing. At the same time, I do not believe that this\nabsolves me from trying to come to grips with it, and colleagues whose\nwork I greatly respect have successfully done this and produced excellent\nfeminist exegeses of\u2014and challenges to\u2014Lacan. The best of this work\nsheds light on the connections and the differences between Lacan and\nSigmund Freud on the one hand and existential phenomenology on the\n1224 \u2759 Kuhn\nother. Where it is linked with the metapsychological study of film, this\nwork is particularly helpful and should be required reading for all students\nof film (Rose 1986).\nFrom the standpoint of psychoanalytic theory the \u201csocial\u201d tendency\ngenerates the demand that psychoanalysis explain phenomena that are\nbeyond its scope. For example, psychoanalysis does not claim to deal with\nsocial aspects of gender and other social differences such as those of \u201crace\u201d\nand class. The very fact that we are asked to review the continuing\nrelevance of psychoanalysis to the study of film (and other media) suggests\nthat these differences remain unfinished business. This has made for a\nfraught encounter between feminist politics on the one hand and psy-\nchoanalytic film theory on the other. An immediate consequence of this\nis that at a certain point the two tendencies parted company and set off\nin quite different directions, without really acknowledging that a sepa-\nration had taken place. The \u201csocial\u201d strand inspired various kinds of cul-\ntural study of cinema and other media (on which more later), while the\n\u201cpsychoanalytic\u201d tendency fed into various feminist-inspired metapsych-\nologies of film, including theories of the masquerade, fantasy, and mas-\nochism (Doane 1982; Cowie 1984; Studlar 1984).\nSo what, if any, is the relevance of feminist psychoanalytic film theory\ntoday? My first response to this question is to say that if I were working in\ncultural studies of cinema (or other media), psychoanalysis would not be\nmy first port of conceptual or methodological call. In this area other ap-\nproaches (such as cultural ethnography and audience research) have proven\nmore productive. If psychoanalysis does offer any continuing relevance to\nunderstanding film (if not necessarily to understanding other media), it will\nbe in a circumscribed arena, accompanied by the recognition that psycho-\nanalysis cannot explain everything. It will also be with objectives that are\nnot powered first and foremost by feminism tout court. That is, we might\nconsider setting aside a totalizing feminist desire (I do not, of course,\nsuggest that such a desire should be abandoned) and not being shy about\nconcentrating on film as distinct from cinema and from other media. With\nthese caveats in mind, I believe that psychoanalysis has a lot to offer film\ntheory, in particular the metapsychology of cinema, in terms of depth of\nunderstanding and inspiration for further inquiry.\n\u201cCinepsychoanalysis\u201d has concerned itself largely with the psychical\norganization of looking and seeing, drawing on the psychoanalytic\naccount of human development: it is for good reason that the subject of\ncinema is invariably called a spectator. This emphasis on vision calls up\nFreud\u2019s thinking on the drives and their activity in creating differences of\nsocial gender out of psychical sexual difference. We should remember that\nS I G N S Autumn 2004 \u2759 1225\nfor Freud, one of the key processes at work here is repression, and therefore\nthe Unconscious. To this extent, in Freudian terms, sexual-libido drives,\nincluding the drive to pleasurable looking (scopophilia), partake in the\nproduction of the Unconscious and have a central unconscious compo-\nnent. This is transported into and elaborated on in Lacan\u2019s thinking. To\nthis extent, psychoanalytic theories of film spectatorship have rested on\nboth the centrality of vision and the activity of the Unconscious, and these\nconcerns have been carried over into feminist psychoanalytic film theory\nin work on \u201cthe gaze.\u201d While, as I shall suggest, psychoanalytic theories\nof the gaze can be seen as rather limiting, there is much work still to be\ndone in this area. In particular, the key question in Christian Metz\u2019s\nseminal essay \u201cThe Imaginary Signifier\u201d (\u201cin what way can psychoanalysis\ncast light on the cinematic signifier?\u201d [1982, 25]) has still not been sat-\nisfactorily answered.\nThis project was more or less abandoned in anglophone film theory,\nlargely because Metz\u2019s work is not only gender blind (which would not\nnecessarily make it untenable) but is also (unacceptably) dismissive of the\nsexual difference agenda informing the Freudian concepts on which it\notherwise productively draws. To cite just one example, Metz rightly\npoints to the role of disavowal (\u201cI know this is not so, but I accept the\nillusion for the time being\u201d) in organizing spectatorial belief and pleasure\nin film, arguing that to this extent the \u201ccinematic signifier\u201d is a fetish\nand\/or that the spectator-film relationship is psychically analogous to that\nbetween the fetishist and his object. At the same time, though, Metz\ncontrives to disregard Freud\u2019s main point about fetishism, which is that\nit arises from the disavowal of sexual difference (Freud 1977). It is possible\nthat, as far as the metapsychology of film is concerned, the disavowal is\nmore important than the sexual difference: we are not after all bound to\nthe letter of Freud. But such a hypothesis calls for inquiry and argument.\nWhat I am suggesting is that prefeminist psychoanalytic film theory,\nor film theory that does not prioritize issues of sexual difference, has been\nprematurely abandoned, and that psychoanalytic metapsychologies of film\nthat do not take sexual difference as their starting point might be just as\nworthy of exploration as those that do. For the latter, feminist readings\nof Freud and Lacan have led the way in that for both Freud and Lacan\nthe key arena of sexual difference is the Oedipal moment, when the infant\nrecognizes the mother\u2019s \u201clack.\u201d However, while most feminist psycho-\nanalytic film theory has followed this lead, a number of writers, feminist\nand otherwise, have argued for the significance of the pre-Oedipal in\nunderstanding the spectator-film relationship (Baudry 1974; Studlar\n1984). Nonetheless, to the best of my knowledge, psychoanalytic work\n1226 \u2759 Kuhn\non early objects and how they get woven into the subject\u2019s experience of\nits world has yet to be thoroughly explored in relation to film as an object\nthat inhabits both our inner and our outer worlds (Winnicott 1971; Kon-\nigsberg 1996). This area, for one, could be significant to the extent that\nit addresses at least two of the objections raised against psychoanalytic\nfilm theory.\nIt has become commonplace to observe that psychoanalytic film\ntheory\u2019s emphasis on vision in the film-spectator encounter is partial, and\nthat spectatorial engagements have been\u2014and with certain kinds of cin-\nema, such as IMAX, remain\u2014more fully embodied than the idea of the\ngaze would suggest (Gunning 1986; Bukatman 1999). In addition to this,\nI would argue that the emphasis on the Unconscious in psychoanalytic\nfilm theory has resulted in a downplaying of the activity of partly or fully\nconscious aspects of the spectator\u2019s inner world in the encounter. That\nis, the spectator\u2019s experience, considered in psychoanalytic terms, might\nalso be usefully addressed (Kuhn 1989, 2003).\nIn conclusion, then, I believe that, as a system of ideas that can illumin-\nate film and in particular add to our understanding of what is at stake in\nthe encounter between films and spectators, psychoanalysis has much to\noffer film theory. To the extent that psychoanalysis can shed light on the\nquestion of how sexual difference organizes this encounter, film scholars\nwho are also interested in questions of a broadly feminist nature will\nundoubtedly continue to follow or contribute to this rather specialized\ndebate. However, I believe that the key agenda for psychoanalytic film\ntheory lies elsewhere.\nCultural studies of cinema (and other media)\nPsychoanalysis is unlikely to prove useful to feminists who are interested\nin cinema (as opposed to film), by which I mean those seeking to inter-\nrogate cinema for its engagements with women, sexual difference, sexual\/\ngender identity, or sexual politics. Many of those who approach cinema\nfrom this angle do so from a base in disciplines other than film studies\u2014\nmedia studies, cultural studies, and women\u2019s studies, for example, as well\nas more traditional disciplines like English, history, or sociology\u2014and so\nmay well be uninterested in the ontology, aesthetics, or metapsychology\nof film. In cultural studies of cinema, films or cinema are studied not in\ntheir own right but as they engage external issues: \u201crace,\u201d gender, violence,\nand so on. By extension, media other than cinema are readily assimilable\nS I G N S Autumn 2004 \u2759 1227\nto this approach. Regardless of the medium, in cultural studies the time\nframe tends to be the present, the media contemporary.\nTerms like reflection and representation characterize work that inquires\ninto the relationship between media content (and occasionally formal\norganization) on the one hand and a range of social issues on the other.\nCultural studies of media may also include inquiries into the consumption\nand uses of media. Because inquiry in these areas can appear deceptively\nstraightforward until you try to do it properly, work in cultural studies of\nmedia can vary enormously in quality. Research methodologies in cultural\nstudies are on the whole underdeveloped, and where they are not (as in\ncertain types of audience research and media ethnography) research design\ncan be complicated and the conduct of a good-quality investigation ex-\npensive and time consuming, often yielding disappointingly superficial\nfindings. However, as long as there are media, and feminists interested in\nmedia, the demand for feminist cultural studies of media will remain. We\nowe it to the discipline and to our students to enhance methodological\nskills and awareness in this area.\nSocial histories of cinema (and other media)\nWhile there is potential for overlap between cultural studies and social\nhistories of media, in that cultural studies methods may be brought to\nbear on historical media and their uses, in practice they remain effectively\nseparate areas of inquiry. Unlike cultural studies, social histories of media\nhave the benefit of established methodological protocols. As far as cinema\nis concerned, certainly, sources and methods of research are well docu-\nmented, and film studies scholars have been pursuing innovative and dis-\ntinctive lines of historical inquiry since the 1970s (Allen and Gomery 1985).\nAt the same time, there is still work to be done in feminist, as in other,\nsocial histories of the media, and excellent examples have been set in\nparticular by some U.S. feminist scholars with backgrounds in film studies\n(see, e.g., Hansen 1991; Staiger 1995). Key areas of feminist inquiry\ninclude the history of women\u2019s contribution to the making of films and\nthe history of women\u2019s activities as consumers of films, and the scope for\nnew research in these fields is clearly potentially international. As far as\nfeminist-informed work in film and media studies worldwide is concerned,\nthis, in my view, is where to seek the cutting edge today.\nInstitute for Cultural Research\nLancaster University\n1228 \u2759 Kuhn\nReferences\nAllen, Robert C., and Douglas Gomery. 1985.
