Art is defined by the distinctive function it plays \nin advancing social relationships through \u201ethe abduction of agency\u201f. Art objects are \nindexes of the artist\u201fs or model\u201fs agency. The paper examines Gell\u201fs use of agency, \nparticularly in relation to the ritual art that is central to his argument. It looks critically at \nwhy Gell selects the term index from Peirce\u201fs triad of index, icon and symbol. I note that \nPeirce\u201fs approach deflects attention from signification toward the link between art works \nand the things they refer to. Finally I consider what Peirce meant by abduction, and \nconclude that while Gell makes a good case for the agency of art objects he does not \nexplain how they function as art. \n \nIntroduction \nIt is now four years since the publication of Alfred Gell\u201fs posthumous book, Art and \nagency. Gell set out to construct a theory of art based neither on aesthetics nor on visual \ncommunication. Gell acknowledges the importance of form, balance and rhythm at \nvarious points in his argument, but argues they are not to be appreciated in the detached \nmanner implied by the term \u201eaesthetics\u201f. His rejection of semiotics is more radical. \nDrawing on Peirce\u201fs concepts of index, icon and symbol, Gell argues that art objects may \n 2 \nbe icons or indexes, but never symbols. Indeed, he frequently treats icon and index as \nsynonymous. The argument is dense and ingenious, and highlights many aspects of the \nsocial role of art objects that have previously been neglected. In the end, however, I \nconsider Gell\u201fs argument is unsustainable. His efforts to exclude Saussurian symbolism \nhave also been criticized by some of the contributors to a recent volume celebrating \nGell\u201fs achievement (Pinney and Thomas 2001). In this paper I propose to recall what \nPeirce, Saussure and Georges Mounin wrote on index, icon, sign and symbol. Peirce and \nSaussure used sign and symbol in quite different fashions, while Mounin (1970) \nelaborated a theory of visual communication that acknowledged the special qualities of \nicons and indexes.[1] Armed with some basic definitions, I shall then critically re-\nexamine Gell\u201fs argument in Art and agency. I shall argue Gell was correct to reject a \nspecifically linguistic model for visual communication, but wrong to minimize the \nimportance of cultural convention in shaping the reception or \u201ereading\u201f of art objects. \n \nGell\u2019s approach to the anthropology of art \nGell sets out to provide an anthropological theory of art, rather than one derived from \nsemiotics or art history. His theory is, specifically, a theory based on British social \nanthropology, on the study of social relationships, rather than culture (Gell 1998: 7). \nThere are, however, two differences between Gell\u201fs anthropology and classic Radcliffe-\nBrownian Structural Functionalism. First, the unit of analysis is not status, reproduced as \na position in a social structure. Gell\u201fs focus is on the agent, and the networks of social \nrelationships constructed through his or her agency. Second, ritual is not misguided \n 3 \nbehaviour that inadvertently has the effect of sustaining the social order, but behaviour to \nbe understood in terms of the participants\u201f own theory of agency. \nArt is defined by the distinctive function it plays in advancing social relationships \nconstructed through agency. Not all objects function as art objects. \u201eAgency can be \nascribed to \u201cthings\u201d without this giving rise to anything particularly recalling the \nproduction and circulation of \u201cart\u201d\u201f (23).[2] Art objects can often be recognized \nintuitively: \u201emost of the art objects I shall actually discuss are well-known ones that we \nhave no difficulty in identifying as \u201cart\u201d; for instance, the Mona Lisa\u201f (7). However, art \nobjects have three diagnostic features. They are usually made so they can be seen (24). \nSecond, art objects are indexes of social agency. Smoke is not art, because it is a natural \nindex of fire, unless the fire has been artificially lit, in which case smoke becomes an \nartefactual index (15). Art objects are further distinguished by being difficult, captivating: \n\u201ethey are difficult to make, difficult to \u201ethink\u201f, difficult to transact. They fascinate, \ncompel, and entrap as well as delight the spectator\u201f (23). \u201eWhere indexes are very \nrecognizably works of art, [they are] made with technical expertise and imagination of a \nhigh order, which exploit the intrinsic mechanisms of visual cognition with subtle \npsychological insight\u201f (68). Anthropology is characterized by its interest in unfamiliar \nmodes of thought. The anthropologist\u201fs task is to describe forms of thought which are not \nparticularly sound from a philosophical perspective, but which are nonetheless socially \nand cognitively practicable (17). Art objects that function as agents in social relations \nconstructed through ritual and magic are therefore particularly instructive for the \nanthropological study of art. \n \n 4 \nExisting work on anthropology of art \nGell\u201fs canon of existing work on the anthropology of art  includes some six authors: \nCoote, Hanson, Kaeppler, Morphy, Richard and Sally Price (Gell 1998: 3, 73). The task \nof an anthropology of art is not, as Price (1989), Coote (1992, 1996), Morphy (1994, \n1996) and other suppose, to define the characteristics of each culture\u201fs aesthetic. Gell \nacknowledges interesting work by Steiner (1994) and Thomas (1991) on the reception of \nnon-Western art in the West, but argues this is not a genuine anthropology of art, since it \ndoes not study art functioning in the context for which it was created (8).  \n Gell rejects Morphy\u201fs (1994) definition of art, that art objects have either or both \n(a) semantic properties, (b) aesthetic properties, that are used for presentational or \nrepresentational purposes (Morphy 1994: 655; Gell could also have cited a similar \ndefinition in Layton 1981: 4). Gell argues that aesthetic properties can only be assessed in \nterms of the intended effect of an art object in its context of use. He entirely rejects the \nnotion of art as a visual code, arguing that nothing \u201eexcept language itself, has \u201cmeaning\u201d \nin the intended sense\u201f (Gell 1998: 6). \nThe studies of decorative art by Price and Price (1980), Kaeppler (1978) and \nHanson (1983) are commended as among \u201ethe more interesting studies which have been \nproduced by anthropologists\u201f (Gell 1998: 73). Hanson is however later criticized for \nfailing to identify a specific correlation between Maori art style and Maori exchange \nnetworks. \n  Gell sets out his vision of the anthropology of art as follows. A programme of \nelucidating non-western aesthetics is exclusively cultural, whereas anthropology is a \nsocial science, not a humanity. The anthropology of art should focus on the social context \n 5 \nof art production, circulation, and reception, not on the evaluation of particular works. \nAnthropology has, from the start, been concerned with things which appear as, or \u201edo \nduty as\u201f persons. Tylor\u201fs work on animism initiated this approach, and it continued with \nMauss\u201fs work on the gift. There is thus a solid basis in anthropological theory for treating \nart objects in the same way. \u201eI view art as a system of action, intended to change the \nworld rather than encode symbolic propositions about it\u201f (Gell 1998: 6). Gell could here \nhave noted the conclusion to chapter two of Layton\u201fs The anthropology of art: \u201eart \nobjects have been seen to play a major role in the patterns of interaction which bring the \npolitical system to life\u201f (Layton 1981: 43). But Layton continues, \u201ethe ideas which gain \ntangible expression in art objects [added italics] appear to be something more than a \npassive reflection of [original italics] the political system; they are rather philosophical \nreflections on the nature of political authority and its place in the world.\u201f Gell \ncategorically rejects a semiotic approach. \n \nWhat\u2019s wrong with existing work? \nAesthetics \nGell\u201fs rejection of aesthetics is less radical than his rejection of art as a visual language. \nHe does not deny that works of art are sometimes intended and received as objects of \naesthetic appreciation (66), but reminds the reader that \u201ethe \u201caesthetic attitude\u201d is a \nspecific historical product of the religious crisis of the Enlightenment and the rise of \nWestern science\u2026 [that brought about] the separation between the beautiful and the holy\u201f \n(97). Gell argues aesthetic values vary from culture to culture and are always embedded \nin a social framework. The anthropology of art should be interested in how aesthetic \n 6 \nprinciples are mobilized in the course of social interaction. \u201eMelanesian aesthetics is \nabout efficacy, the capacity to accomplish tasks, not \u201cbeauty\u201d\u201f (94). Trobrianders \nattribute outstanding skill to superior magic, Westerners attribute it to artistic inspiration.  \nI find these arguments uncontroversial. Of course aesthetic values vary from \nculture to culture, and their effect may be construed within a different theory of being \n(Layton 1981: 11-19). Forge long ago documented that Abelam artists discuss form and \nproportion in their work, but \u201ethe skilful artist who satisfies his aesthetic sense and \nproduces beauty is rewarded not for the beauty itself but because the beauty\u2026 is \nrecognized by the others as power\u201f (Forge 1967: 82-3). Morphy later showed in greater \ndetail how Yolngu artists are clearly concerned to produce effects on the senses which \nEuropeans would interpret as aesthetic, but \u201ewhat Europeans interpret at a general level as \nan aesthetic effect Yolngu interpret as a manifestation of ancestral power\u201f (Morphy 1989: \n23). \nNor does Gell reject universals. Acknowledging Washburn and Crowe (1992), he \nargues (160) \u201eThere exists what amounts to a \u201cuniversal aesthetic\u201d of patterned surface; \nthe same symmetry configurations\u2026 turn up all over the world.\u201f Gell attributes two \nfunctions to the formal qualities of decorative art. The world is filled with decorated \nobjects because decoration is often an essential aspect of the technology of enchantment. \nDecorative patterns weave their spell because \u201ewe can never quite understand the \ncomplex relationships they embody\u201f (80).  Relationships between the elements of \ndecorative art are, secondly, analogous to social relationships constructed through \nexchange.  \n 7 \n I disagree with Gell\u201fs discussion of aesthetics to the extent he only recognizes \ncases that support his own agency-oriented approach. Many other social contexts for the \nappreciation of form can be found in the anthropological literature. Hughes-Freeland \n(1997) discusses whether the Dutch introduced aesthetics to Java, or whether an aesthetic \nof dance already existed. The Lega of Central Africa treat ivory carvings with castor oil, \npolish and perfume to beautify them (Biebuyck 1973: 179). Consistent with Bourdieu\u201fs \ntheory of taste (Bourdieu 1984), Lega objects made of ivory and well polished wood are \nsocially the most important because they are associated with the highest grades of the \nBwami association, and therefore with the most skilled and experienced leaders. Mende \nof Sierra Leone expect women to be beautiful, delicate, pretty and groomed. They also \nexpect women to be kind, patient and loving. \u201eThe Mende word nyande means both to be \ngood and to be beautiful\u2026 no one can be beautiful if she doesn\u201ft have a fine character\u201f \n(Boone 1993: 304). Beauty is dangerous because it is powerful, but the danger is that a \nbeautiful Mende girl may become arrogant and narcissistic. Among the Wola of Papua-\nNew Guinea men imitate birds of paradise and incorporate their feathers in ceremonial \nheaddresses worn at exchange festivals. They do so not because they expect some \nsympathetic magic-like transference of the birds\u201f qualities to themselves but because the \ndancers wish to appear virile and handsome by modeling themselves upon the birds\u201f \nbehaviour (Sillitoe 1988: 310-11).  \n \nThe linguistic model \nThomas rightly notes in his foreword to Art and agency that the book is most radical, not \nin its rejection of aesthetics as a basis for an anthropological theory, but in its rejection of \n 8 \nthe view that art is a matter of meaning and communication. \u201eVisual art objects are not a \npart of language\u2026 nor do they constitute an alternative language\u201f (Gell 1998: 6). Art \nobjects are only signs with meanings when they are used as a part of language, i.e. as \ngraphic signs. Gell wishes to avoid \u201ethe slightest imputation that (visual) art is \u201elike \nlanguage\u201f (14). \n  The stated motive for Gell\u201fs attack is the failure of structuralist semiotic \nanthropology in the 1970s (163). At that period, Gell writes, \u201eit was customary to discuss \nsystems of all kinds as \u201clanguages\u201d\u2026. Art was the (cultural) \u201clanguage of visual forms\u201d \n(164, AG\u201fs parenthesis). Gell singles out Faris (1971) and Korn (1978) who constructed \nvocabularies of visual elements and grammatical rules for combining them into well-\nformed motifs or compositions. He objects that there is no hierarchy of levels in art \nequivalent to the phoneme - morpheme \u2013 syntactic structures of language. Lines, circles \nand zigzags are not visual phonemes. This may be a fair comment, but language is not the \nonly form of human communication. The French semiologist Mounin (1970) made much \nof the unique \u201edouble articulation\u201f of language just as Saussure, the founder of \nsemiology, emphasised the distinctive arbitrariness of the association of sounds in \nlanguage and the prototypes they denote. \nIn fact, just as Gell accepts the study of aesthetics where it can elucidate the \npower of art objects as agents, so he concedes there is some value in a semiotic approach, \nprovided it does not rely on a linguistic model. \u201eNo reasonable person could suppose that \nart-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of \nsemiosis; however one approaches the subject there seems something irreducibly \n 9 \nsemiotic about art\u201f (14). Gell uses the terms meaning and semiosis imprecisely. I return \nto these issues after outlining Gell\u201fs theory of agency. \n \nAgency \nGell defines agency in the following terms:  \nAgency is attributable to those persons (and things, see below) who\/which are \nseen as initiating causal sequences\u2026 events caused by acts of mind or will or \nintention\u2026. An agent is the source, the origin, of causal events, independently of \nthe state of the physical universe (Gell 1998: 16, his parenthesis).  \nOn the face of it, art objects cannot therefore be agents in themselves, but act merely as \nextensions (indexes) of their maker or user\u201fs agency. As Gell writes, art objects are not \nself-sufficient agents, but secondary agents that have effect by virtue of being enmeshed \nin social relationships.  \nAlthough Gell does not cite an authority for his use of the term \u201eagency\u201f, it is \nnoteworthy that Giddens saw an intimate connection between agency and power. For \nGiddens, agency does not refer to people's intentions but to their ability to act. Agency is \nthe ability to act in particular ways, where more than one course of action is possible. \nOne ceases to be an agent if one can no longer make a difference, in other words, where \nonly a single course of action is practically available (see Giddens 1984: 9, 15). Each of \nthe various forms of constraint simultaneously enables someone else to exercise agency \n(Giddens 1984: 173). Gell emphasizes the ritual efficacy of art; the ability of designs to \nentrap the recipient in competitive exchange, to dazzle the opposing warrior or deflect \nevil spirits, all of which contribute to an argument for agency as power. \n 10 \nThe idea of art objects as social agents is not new. \u201eWe will not attempt to reduce \nthe ideas and values given expression in art objects to a servile reflection of social \ninteraction, but rather assess their impact as agents of an ideology upon the form of social \nrelations\u201f (Layton 1981: 43; see also Wolff 1981: 24-5). The difference lies in the type of \nagency attributed to art objects. \nHow does an art object extend its maker\u201fs or user\u201fs agency? Gell argues that \ncausal chains initiated by agents come into being as states of mind and are oriented to the \nstates of mind of other actors. If the initiator and recipient do not come into contact, the \ninitiator\u201fs agency must be mediated by physical objects. We detect their agency in the \ndisturbances they leave in the material world. A stone chipped in a suggestive way \nattracts our attention because it may be a prehistoric tool and therefore an index of \nancient agency. Kula objects are ultimately attached to powerful persons, but circulate \nwell beyond their physical reach. Kula valuables associated with a participant\u201fs name are \nindexes of his bodily presence. Gell identifies four types of agency that art objects can \npossess. Sometimes the agency is psychological, as when a spectator is impressed by \ntechnical excellence or erotically aroused. Sometimes the art object\u201fs agency is physical, \nas when a supplicant is cured by kissing a religious icon. Works of art are sometimes \nintended and received as objects of aesthetic appreciation; they may, indeed, sometimes \nfunction semiotically, but Gell specifically rejects the notion that they always do (66). \nPeople and things are only agents if there is a recipient (a \u201epatient\u201f) for them to act \nupon. Patients enter into a social relationship with the index, the art object. The art object \nin turn refers to a prototype (such as an historic individual, or a deity), either by \nrepresenting it iconically (Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds) or by an indexical \n 11 \nassociation \u2013 such as a stone cast as a thunderbolt by the deity. Chapter 3 of Art and \nagency is a highly original and extremely methodical working through of the \npermutations offered by the relationships between these four terms. The fundamental \nquestion is, then, how indexes or icons have agency, how they mediate the interaction of \nstates of mind. Gell cites land mines as agents of the evil intent in the minds of Pol Pot\u201fs \nsoldiers (Gell 1998: 21). Pol Pot\u201fs soldiers used them as extensions of their own agency. \nThis is a misleading parallel. Art objects do not have the same kind of agency as man \ntraps or poisoned arrows. If Pol Pot\u201fs soldiers had spent their time burying pictures of the \nMona Lisa, or even pictures of Pol Pot, there would not be so many Cambodians whose \nlives today have been ruined by shattered limbs. Nor is Gell\u201fs book illustrated with \ndiagrams of land mine firing mechanisms, breech-loading cannon, etc., but rather with \nreproductions of paintings, sculptures, tattoos and decorative designs. \n \nIndex and icon \nGell draws on Peirce\u201fs theory of semiotics to characterize the way in which art objects \nfunction as social agents. Gell uses the technical term \u201eindex\u201f instead of \u201eart object.\u201f The \nindex characterizes the distinctive way in which art relates some object to a social agent. \n\u201eAn \u201eindex\u201f in Peircean semiotics is a \u201enatural sign\u201f\u2026 from which the observer can make \na causal inference of some kind, or an inference about the intentions or capabilities of \nanother person\u201f (Gell 1998: 13). Smoke is an index of fire, of the agency of the fire-\nlighter. \nThe naturalness of the index is crucial to Gell\u201fs escape from a linguistic model. In \nPeirce\u201fs theory the index was one of three types of sign: index, icon and symbol, \n 12 \nclassified according to the way in which they are linked with the object - Gell\u201fs prototype \n(Peirce 1955: 100-109). An index refers to an object by virtue of being really affected by \nthat object. A sundial is an index of the time of day, a weathervane an index of wind \ndirection. An iconic sign, such as a picture of a horse, or an onomatopoeic sound (woof, \nneigh), has some of the same characteristics of the thing it denotes. An icon is a sign of \nan object to the extent that it is like that object. A Peircian symbol is arbitrarily associated \nwith what it denotes, and this is the case with the vast majority of the words in any \nlanguage. The link between the word [symbol] and the object is wholly established by \nconvention. \nGell is clearly using index in the way it was defined by Peirce and Morris. So too \nin his use of icon: \u201eI believe that iconic representation is based on the actual resemblance \nin form between depictions and the entities they depict\u201f (Gell 1998: 25). While symbol \ndoes not figure much in Gell\u201fs argument, he does use it in the Peircian sense. \u201eI do not \nbelieve that iconic representation is based on symbolic \u201cconvention\u201d (comparable to the \n\u201cconventions\u201d which dictate that \u201cdog\u201d means \u201ccanine animal\u201d in English)\u201f (25).  \n \nConflation of index and icon \nGell decided to avoid not only a linguistic model, but also any appeal to the role of \nculture in educating the eye (Gell 1998: 2, quoting Price 1989). Index, icon and symbol \ncan therefore be ranked in order of decreasing usefulness to Gell. The index and icon \nhave an intrinsic connection with the objects they denote, unlike the Peircian symbol, \nwhich depends entirely on cultural convention. \u201eA symbol is a sign which refers to the \nobject that it denotes by virtue of a law, usually an association of general ideas\u201f (Peirce \n 13 \n1955: 102). A symbol is no use to Gell. An icon is also relatively unhelpful, because it is \nnever identical to its prototype, a point that Gell glosses over with a couple of passing \nremarks: \u201ewithout pausing to unravel the very difficult question as to the nature of the \nrelationship between real and depicted persons\u201f (15). \u201eIt is true that some \n\u201crepresentations\u201d are very schematic\u2026. Recognition on the basis of very under-specified \ncues is a well-explored part of the process of visual perception\u201f (25). Iconicity in art, the \nresemblance between an art object and its prototype, is mediated by cultural convention. \nThis process is, in my assessment, both central to a comparative anthropology of art and \nirredeemably cultural (Layton 1981, chapter 4). Rather than address the issue, Gell \ncircumvents it by treating icons as a subset of indexes.  \nOne may need to be told that a given index is an iconic representation of a \nparticular pictorial subject (26). \nPrototypes: entities held, by abduction, to be represented in the index, often by \nvirtue of visual resemblance, but not necessarily (27). \n\u201eiconic\u201f\u2026 that is, indexes physically resembling a prototype (97). \nThe clearest conflation of index and icon occurs in Gell\u201fs discussion of Lucretius. Gell \nproposes that the convergence of images (icons), and parts (indexes) of things, can be \napproached from a philosophical angle through the doctrine of \u201eemanations\u201f, which \n\u201e\u201cprimitive\u201d people anticipated, in their confusion\u201f (Gell 1998: 104). This Epicurian \ndoctrine was clearly stated by Lucretius: idols (simulacra) of things are like films peeled \noff the surface of things, which fly to and fro through the air. \u201ePictures of things\u2026 are \nemitted from things off their surface,\u201f like the smoke which logs of wood emit (De \nRerum Natura 4: 26, quoted Gell: 105). \n 14 \nThere is something special about the index because, according to Peirce, an index \n\u201enecessarily has some quality in common with the object\u201f (prototype) (Peirce 1955: 102). \nUnlike the connection between a word and the thing it denotes, the link is not constructed \nby cultural convention. \u201eIndexes are not part of a calculus (a set of tautologies, like \nmathematics) nor are they components of a natural or artificial language in which terms \nhave meaning established by convention\u201f (Gell 1998: 13). A Kula valuable \u201edoes not \n\u201cstand for\u201d someone important, in a symbolic way; to all intents and purposes it is an \nimportant person in that age, influence, and something like \u201cwisdom\u201d inheres in its \nphysical substance\u2026 mind and reality are one\u201f (231). Sometimes the index really is a \nperson, as when a child is possessed by a deity (67). \n \nSense and reference \nThe distinction between sense and reference was identified by Frege. Saussure\u201fs primary \nconcern was with sense, or signification: how sounds are conventionally related to ideas \nin the structure of the language. Peirce, on the other hand, classifies signs according to \nthe way they refer to objects in the environment. \u201eTo refer is what the sentence does in a \ncertain situation and according to a certain use. It is also what the speaker does when he \napplies his words to reality\u201f (Ricoeur 1976: 20). Peirce\u201fs approach is therefore more \nappropriate to Gell\u201fs aims than is Saussure\u201fs. However, sense and reference are difficult \nto discuss in isolation. Saussure is clearly writing about reference when he describes \nspoken language as arbitrary in the sense that words do not rely on onomatopoeia, but on \npurely conventional sounds (Saussure 1959: 69). Equally, Peirce takes sense into account \nwhen he writes, \u201ethe sign stands for something, its object\u2026. Not in all respects, but in \n 15 \nreference to a sort of idea\u201f (Peirce 1955: 99). Saussure is also ambiguous in his example \nof what he calls a symbol, \u201ethe symbol of justice, a pair of scales, could not be replaced \nby just any other symbol, such as a chariot\u201f (Saussure 1959: 68). While he apparently \nintends that the idea of a pair of scales is a metaphor for balanced judgement, he might \nalso have intended that justice could be represented by a picture (an icon) of a pair of \nscales. Gell\u201fs tendency to downplay sense is consistent with his critique of structuralism \nand the linguistic model, but it is difficult to see how a discussion of both reference and \nsense can be avoided, if art is about the ability to influence minds.  \n \nAbduction \nIn order to avoid treating art as a medium of communication, Gell introduces the term \nabduction. \u201e \u201cArt-like situations\u201d can be discriminated as those in which the material \n\u201eindex\u201f (the visible, physical, \u201cthing\u201d) permits a particular cognitive operation which I \nidentify as the abduction of agency\u201f (Gell 1998: 13). Abductions are inferential schemes, \nand we infer the same type of agency in a real and a depicted person\u201fs smile (15). The \ninference is based on a supposition. Abduction was defined by Eco, following Peirce, as \nthe process that occurs when \u201ewe find some very curious circumstances, which would be \nexplained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt \nthat supposition\u201f (Eco 1976: 131, citing Peirce 1931-1958: 2.624, quoted Gell 1998: 14). \nPeople act as if there were rules but art, unlike language, does not depend on \nconventional rules.  \nGell illustrates the process of abduction with an example taken from L\u00e9vi-Strauss, \nin which a Dakota Indian, described energy gushing forth through matter, making or \n 16 \nleaving things each time it stops (Gell 1998: 248-9). This is strikingly similar to the \nPitjantjatjara theory of being (Layton 1995). The things left by a supernatural agency \nbecome indexes of the agent\u201fs creativity (Gell 1998: 249). Similarly Maori meeting \nhouses, according to Thomas, \u201ewere not \u201csymbols\u201d\u2026 but vehicles of a collectivity\u201fs \npower. They simultaneously indexed a group\u201fs own vitality and ideally or effectively \ndisempowered others\u201f (Thomas 1995: 103, cited Gell 251). The whole thrust of Gell\u201fs \nargument is thus to get away from signification and establish a real, material link between \nthe art object, as index, and its prototype, the primary agent.  \n \nAgency, not signification  \nGell recognizes the difficulty of replacing a theory based on art objects as visual \nsignifiers with one based on art objects as agents. \u201eTo assert\u2026 the idol is not a \n\u201cdepiction\u201d of the god, but the body of the god is all very well, but I accept that any such \nassertion constitutes a paradox\u201f (99). There are two principal stages in Gell\u201fs theory of \nagency in art. The first considers agency in individual objects, the second considers the \nartist\u201fs \u0153uvre as an aspect of his social identity. \n \nThe individual object \nGell\u201fs theory of agency is directed toward the way in which actors\u201f states of mind are \naltered. Causal chains initiated by agents come into being as states of mind and are \noriented to the states of mind of other actors. Abduction is a cognitive operation. The \nagency of art objects therefore derives from the way in which they affect the mind of the \nrecipient (the patient). \n 17 \nGell\u201fs first step is to cite Frazer\u201fs theory of magic. The power of the icon is \nexemplified through what Frazer called homeopathic magic. Homeopathic magic aims to \ndestroy an enemy by destroying an image of him, or cure someone by giving them \nmedicine made of healthily-coloured objects (Frazer 1994: 29). The power of the index is \nexemplified by contagious magic. Contagious magic works on fragments a person gives \noff, such as hair or nail clippings (Frazer 1994: 37). \u201eThe kind of leverage which one \nobtains over a person or thing by having access to their image is comparable, or really \nidentical, to the leverage which can be obtained by having access to some physical part of \nthem\u201f (Gell 1998: 105). \nDuring the 1960s, around the time Gell and I were students, there was a debate \nabout the difference between ritual and science, and how best to render magical actions \nrational (Lienhardt 1961, Goody 1961, Horton 1960, 1964; Beattie 1966). Gell cites one \nof the principal contributors. Beattie criticized Frazer for attributing causal intentions to \nmagical practices. Beattie argued magic is in fact symbolic or expressive. He concluded \nthat spirit mediums among the Nyoro put on a dramatic performance that was satisfying \nin its own right as a theatrical representation of the everyday hazards of Nyoro life, and \nnot intended to change them (Beattie 1966:72).Gell challenges Beattie\u201fs attempt to deny \na means-end relationship in ritual or magic: \u201eMagic is possible because intentions cause \nevents to happen in the vicinity of agents\u201f (Gell 1998: 101, Gell\u201fs emphasis). Magic \nregisters and publicizes the strength of desire and therefore has an effect, just as Gell\u201fs \ndesire for a boiled egg causes the egg to be cooked. If one were taking a semiotic \napproach similar to that advocated by Beattie, contagious magic would become a case of \nmetonymy: calling the whole by the name of a part to dramatize the enemy\u201fs suffering. \n 18 \nBut Gell rejects this: \u201eThese exuviae do not stand metonymically for the victim; they are \nphysically detached fragments of the victim\u201fs \u201cdistributed personhood\u201d\u201f (104). Like the \nclassic Peircian index, the nail clipping is an index of the person as smoke is of fire. A \nMalangan funerary carving is a skin for the deceased (Cf. Lucretius), which creates new \nskins in the memories of the onlookers. \u201eThus memory becomes a socially engineered \nmedium for the transmission of the power to change the world\u201f (227). According to Gell, \nall this happens without visual communication.  \nGell then moves to a more complex case, the worship of images. Because \n\u201efertility can be represented \u2013 i.e. objectified in an index \u2013 it comes under the control of \nthose who control the index, the priests\u201f (107). Hindu images are worshipped to gain \nblessing (darshan) that is conveyed through the eyes of the image [icon]. Ancient Indian \nphilosophers held that the eyes send out invisible beams. Darshan is \u201ethe gift of \nappearance\u201f imagined as a material transfer. Some Indian philosophers compare darshan \nas \u201eseeing\u201f to the way the blind use a stick to ascertain the shape of objects. In relation to \nimages, there is thus no distinction between similarity and contact (i.e. icon and index).  \nFreedberg asked whether religious and other images are efficacious because the \nrituals of consecration have endowed them with power, or because they are images linked \nby mimesis to what they represent. Freedberg chose the second solution and argued they \nare images with signifying functions (Freedberg 1989; Gell 1998: 150). Gell \nacknowledges Freedberg\u201fs very pertinent objection that collapsing art objects into real \npersons risks losing sight of the specificity of art but opts for the first, on the tendentious \ngrounds that the anthropologist deals primarily with human beings themselves playing a \nrole, rather than portraits and effigies. He goes on to discuss a case where the deity is \n 19 \nembodied in a living person, a living icon. The transition between a person and an image \nis \u201einsensible\u201f; the position they occupy in networks of agency \u201emay be regarded as \nalmost entirely equivalent\u201f (153).  \nGell claims the Tylorian concept of animism can be made more serviceable if it is \nremoved from its pejorative Victorian context. Nonetheless I find this stage in Gell\u201fs \nargument embarrassingly prone to recapitulate the twin Victorian strategies of \u201eIf I were a \nsavage\u201f, and \u201eThe western child is like the adult savage\u201f (see Gell 1998: 125, 129, 134). \nGell\u201fs strategy of asking how people believe art objects have agency is, however, a useful \none. The Lucretian doctrine of images as cast-off skins is similar to the Australian one of \nincreasing a species by rubbing or smoking the rock (or painting) which is the \ntransformed body of the totemic ancestor. It is a different causal theory to ours, based on \na different ontology. Within the Aboriginal theory of the interchangeability of energy and \nmatter (Layton 1995) increase rites are not symbolic, but rely on cause and effect. I agree \nwith Gell, contra Beattie, if the aim is to understand another theory of being, and how it is \nworked out in practice. Following Horton, Frazer\u201fs mistake was to assume there was no \ntheory of being underpinning magic. In religious thought, Horton argued, social relations \nare taken as the model on which the working of the world is conceptualized. This is \npreferred in societies where social relations provide \u201ethe most markedly ordered and \nregular area of their experience\u201f (Horton 1964: 99). Horton\u201fs theory of religion implies \npeople attribute agency to sculptures because they have a religious explanatory model of \nhow the world works, that the world is animated by human-like agencies. In these \ncircumstances, the position a person and an image occupy in networks of agency may \nindeed be regarded as similar, if not almost entirely equivalent. \n 20 \n If one wants to go beyond cultural relativism, a provocative philosophical and \nmoral problem is encountered. Do we take an Enlightenment view that our explanation is \nsuperior to theirs, or a post-modernist view that all theories of being are equal, and only \npower enables one to prevail over others? Lienhardt\u201fs solution was to focus on examples \nwhere influencing the participants\u201f state of mind was, from both a Western and an \nindigenous point of view, intrinsic to the success of the action but, like Beattie, Lienhard \nconsiders the result (such as peace between warring clans) is achieved by dramatizing the \ndesire. \nGell acknowledges that people in non-Western cultures can tell the difference \nbetween an image and a person. Many cases of skepticism among the illiterate and \nuneducated have been recorded; \u201ethe devotee does know that the image of the god is only \nan image\u201f (Gell 1998: 118). If it were to move or speak that would be a miracle. Argenti \ngives a pertinent example from the Cameroon Grassfields. The potter Elizabeth Nbwe \nSonjonka explained to Argenti that she could not make anthropomorphic forms because, \n\u201eWoman bears life; how [why] will she then model it? To say one is like God \u2013 that is a \nbad thing\u201f (Argenti 1995: 89). But this puts into question Gell\u201fs claim that the position a \nperson and an image occupy in networks of agency can be considered almost entirely \nequivalent. Why bother with images, if people will do? Why not have someone sit or lie \nmotionless in the place of a statue of the Buddha? Why not station people along the \nroadside to shout at each passing car \u201eroad works ahead, elderly people crossing\u201f? \n  \n 21 \nThe artist\u2019s \u0153uvre \nIn contrast to the problems with the first stage in Gell\u201fs argument about the agency \ninherent in art, I find his second stage brilliantly convincing. Agency derives from a \nposition in a network in social relationships. Since we are constructed by our social \nrelationships, our inner personhood replicates what we are externally (compare Myers \n1986). Personal agency creates the distributed art objects that belong to the corpus; our \nmind becomes manifest in the objects, traces and leavings we generate during our \nlifetime. There is a structural isomorphy between something internal \u2013 mind or \nconsciousness \u2013 and something external, the aggregate of artworks (Gell 1988: 222). The \ncirculation of indexes steadily transforms agents\u201f conscious experience. The right to \nproduce a Malangan sculpture, for example, indexes a wider bundle of rights, including \nland rights (Cf. Morphy 1991: 57-74 on rights to produce bark paintings depicting \ntotemic ancestors). Stage two of Gell\u201fs argument can stand independently of stage one. It \nis consistent with Peirce\u201fs theory. Peirce regarded an algebraic formula as an icon \u201ein that \nit makes quantities look alike which are in analogous relations to the problem\u201f (Peirce \n1955: 107).  \n Despite having rejected the relevance of culture for an anthropological theory of \nart, culture becomes central to Gell\u201fs argument in chapter 8. This may be is an \ninconsistency Gell would have dealt with if he had had longer to revise the book, but I \nthink Gell is here using culture in a different sense to the one earlier rejected. Gell \nappears to use culture as a way of describing the characteristic way a community \norganizes its social relationships; a way of doing things which demands agency. The style \nof an art tradition maps out, and can be used to manipulate, social relationships. Gell cites \n 22 \nFernandez (Gell 1998: 153). Fernandez reported that among the Fang the production of \naesthetically pleasing carvings is an aspect of culture, and is less valued than bringing \nabout harmony in social relations (Fernandez 1973: 194 \u20136). \nGell exemplifies this approach through an extended discussion of Marquesan art \nand social exchange. Marquesan art was not representational in the Western sense of \ndepicting objects that existed independently of the art, but a ritual art intended to make \nthe bearer powerful and invulnerable. The limitless variations on recognizably \nMarquesan themes within the art shows however a passion for creating difference which \nparallels, or has an \u201eelective affinity\u201f (219) with the social differences created through \nexchange. Individual art works do not signify social status, they merely advertise their \nstanding as variant parts of the whole, the corpus of Marquesan art, through their \nrecognizable style.   \n \nIndex, icon and cultural convention  \nGell makes a good case for art as agency, but not for agency as art. To understand the \ntype of agency characteristic of art, we need to study the distinctive way in which \npaintings and carvings affect people. An argument that art objects have the same kind of \nefficacy, or function in the same way as land mines, cannot be sustained. In what ways is \nagency mapped out through social relations by means of art objects? The distribution of \ncommissioned paintings and sculptures \u2013 Michaelangelo\u201fs Holy Family and Last \nJudgement, the Pope\u201fs Tomb and the Sistine Chapel \u2013 do not map out agency in the same \nway that Hitler or Stalin\u201fs agency was mapped out in the death camps, the gulags, the ebb \nand flow of huge armies. Nor does art map agency in the same way that the career of a \n 23 \npowerful industrialist is mapped through the sale of commodities, construction of \nfactories and the employment of thousands of workers. Of course, the Renaissance \nChurch\u201fs power and wealth is manifest in the distribution of Michaelangelo\u201fs work. Like \nMarquesan art, Nazi propaganda posters and the art of Soviet socialist realism also map a \nparallel course to social action, but a picture of valiant workers does not affect the viewer \nin the same way as a day\u201fs work in the Siberian salt mines. The difference is similar to \nthe difference between a powerful electric shock and the notice attached to a fence \ndepicting a figure falling back under the blow of a jagged flash of electricity. The first is \nbrute energy, the second is coded information. Art objects can be related to their primary \nagents (the artist, patron and prototype) because, to the competent viewer, they embody \npertinent information. \nGell is right to argue that icons and indexes, unlike spoken words, are not entirely \ndependent on conventional, cultural structures. They are not, however, entirely natural \nsigns. Icons, and the indexes embodied in art, do depend on cultural convention. It is \nclear from several of Gell\u201fs examples that the significance of indexes depends on cultural \nconvention. Gell cites Turner\u201fs ethnography of tree saps used in Ndembu ritual as an \nintrinsic indexical form of agency. Blood coloured sap cures menstrual dysfunction. Yet \nhe continues: \u201eThe most common case is for the material index to dictate its form simply \non the basis of traditional knowledge\u201f (29), surely a property of culture or habitus. \nTurner\u201fs work on Ndembu colour symbolism (Turner 1962a, 1962b, 1965) makes the \nimportance of cultural context very clear. Gell writes that where an idol is an artefact \nrather than a natural object, \u201ethe nature of agency exerted by the prototype is to cause the \n 24 \nartist to produce a religiously stipulated image according to the conventions for such \nimages\u201f (99, Gell\u201fs italic; my bold).  \nIcons are different from indexes. Icons are not a product or part of the prototype. \nIcons resemble their prototypes but are not identical to them. \u201eThe semantic rule for the \nuse of icons is that they denote those objects which have the characteristics they \nthemselves have \u2013 or more usually a certain specified set of their characteristics\u2019 (Morris \n1938: 24, my emphasis). Here, too, culture intervenes. \u201eThe way in which such dissimilar \nreptiles as tortoises and lizards have become visually synonymous in Marquesan art \npartly reflects their similar symbolic associations\u201f (Gell 1998: 180n). The image must \noften \u201elook like\u201f what it represents, but according to cultural convention. Totemic art in \nnorthern Australia, and on the Northwest Coast of North America, illustrates this well \n(Boas 1955: 186-209; Morphy 1991: 155-164; Taylor 1996: 147-168). To paint or carve \nanother group\u201fs totem would be to claim their land. Gell asserts: \u201eculture may dictate the \npractical and\/or symbolic significance of artefacts, and their icongraphic interpretation, \nbut the only factor which governs the visual appearance of artefacts is their relationship \nto other artefacts in the same style\u201f (Gell 1998: 216). This may be true of Marquesan art, \nbut it is demonstrably not the case where two or more art styles co-exist in a community. \nLawal\u201fs study of Yoruba art styles includes good examples (Lawal 1985). The difference \nbetween silhouette and geometric art among the Yolgnu, or \u201ex-ray\u201f and geometric infill in \nWestern Arnhem Land rock art, is partly a matter of stylistic convention but it also relates \nimportantly to the kind of information the art is intended to convey (Morphy 1991: 176-\n180; Taylor 1996: 224-238). \n \n 25 \nWhen Gell does write about meaning and semiotics, he is in fact sometimes discussing \nreference. \u201eWhere geometric forms occur as graphic signs, they are meaningful in \nthemselves (a circle can represent an eye)\u201f (Gell 1998: 165). Representation is the means \nby which icons refer to objects, Gell\u201fs prototypes. Broadly speaking, there are two types \nof reference. Peirce\u201fs definition of index, icon and symbol are based on the way signs \nrefer to objects (a circle can look like an eye). Eco extends Peirce\u201fs approach in his \nanalysis of textual interpretation. A text refers to a universe of discourse, and thereby \neliminates some possible misreadings (Eco 1990: 28 and 60, compare Ricoeur 1991: 93 \nand see also Layton 2000). Gell is alluding to the second type of reference, reference to \nan artistic discourse, in his analysis of the relation of individual objects to the stylistic \ntradition of Marquesan art. He writes, \u201ethis is the sense in which any part \u201cstands for\u201d the \nwhole\u201f as in synecdoche\u2026. \u201cRepresenting\u201d in this sense is clearly a semiotic relation, in \nwhich the object is a sign, and the corpus of stylistically related objects from which it is \ndrawn, is what is signified thereby\u201f (Gell 1998: 166). This impoverishes the notion of \nsignification.  \nOne of Gell\u201fs fundamental objections to the linguistic model was its reliance on \nStructuralism. He condemned the Structuralist semiotic anthropology of the 1970s for \nconstructing vocabularies of visual elements and grammatical rules for combining them \ninto well-formed motifs or compositions. However, his conclusion to the Marquesan case \nstudy is that the multiplicity of variant forms \u201esuggest an overwhelming need to establish \ndifference and a recognition of the merely relative character of all differences\u201f (220). \nThis surely a Structuralist proposition! Shortly afterwards, Gell refers to \u201ethe structural \n 26 \nisomorphy between something \u201cinternal\u201d (mind or consciousness) and something \n\u201cexternal\u201d \u2013 aggregates of artworks\u201f (222). \nGell writes \u201eSemiotic\/interpretative theories of art give prominence to the fact that \nwhat a person sees in a picture, or, even more, gleans from an utterance or a text, is a \nfunction of their previous experience, their mind-set, their culture, etc.\u201f(33). He construes \nthis approach as a denial of the intrinsic agency of art objects, implying that it stems from \nthe postmodern argument that the reader or viewer can make whatever they choose of \nobjects in a gallery. The connection with current western notions of individualism is, as \nhe says, obvious. But this is not adequate to dismiss the semiotic argument that even to \nconstrue the artist\u2019s agency correctly the viewer must rely on \u201etheir previous experience, \ntheir mind-set, their culture.\u201f Campbell spells this out very clearly in her analysis of the \nart on Vakutan Kula canoes. The process by which specific animals in the Vakutan \nenvironment are represented is mimetic. The system by which form and meaning \nconverge is symbolic, the means aesthetic (Campbell 2001: 133). In chapter four of Art \nand agency, Gell criticizes western misunderstandings of West African nail fetishes. He \nwrites, \u201ethe apparent rhyme between these carvings and Western images of suffering and \nviolation is fortuitous\u201f (59). The point is that we interpret them according to our \nexperience of the Christian tradition, whereas those who were intended to view them rely \non their own cultural tradition. Recent work on the anthropology of landscape makes it \nvery clear that signs of agency in landscapes are construed according to the habitual \nunderstandings gained through life in a distinctive cultural tradition (Strang 1997, Layton \n1997 and papers in Hirsch and O\u201fHanlon 1995 and Bender and Winer 2001). \n \n 27 \nAbduction is a concept taken from semiotics. As defined by Peirce, and used by Eco, \nabduction says nothing about the presence or absence of rules. It characterizes the logical \nprocedure a person can adopt when they think they have detected a pattern in events and \nact upon that supposition. \u201ethe logic of interpretation is the Peircian logic of abduction. \nTo make a conjecture means to figure out a Law that can explain a Result\u201f (Eco 1990: \n59). Eco quotes two examples from Peirce. One is a purely statistical question of \nprobability concerning bags of coloured beans. The other reads as follows: \u201eI once landed \nat a seaport in a Turkish province; and\u2026 met a man on horseback, surrounded by four \nhorsemen holding a canopy over his head. As the governor of the province was the only \npersonage I could think of who would be so greatly honoured, I inferred that it was he. \nThis was an hypothesis\u201f (Eco 1976: 131, citing Peirce 1931-1958: 2.265). It would be a \nmatter of further investigation to discover whether an elaborate protocol of coloured \ncanopies, numbers of attendants etc. existed to signal status, or whether the governor, on \na whim, used his superior authority to call up four horsemen to shelter him from the sun \non a particularly hot day (see also Keen 2001: 32-3). \nThe essential differences between art and language hinge on such questions of \nconvention and formalization. Gell is probably right to argue that the most clearly \nstructured art systems are those which closely mirror language, such as the road signs of \nthe highway code, or the conventional motifs for house, tree, road and river on maps. But \neven here, art has different properties to language. We can construe a new and unfamiliar \nroad sign such as \u201eelk crossing road ahead\u201f as soon as we encounter it. The style of the \nsilhouette and the red triangle refer us to the discourse of road signs, but the black \nsilhouette in the warning triangle edged with red has an iconic resemblance to a large \n 28 \nanimal found in Scandinavian forests (compare Mounin 1970: 20 on reading the Michelin \nGuide). We need to know the stylistic conventions of the Highway Code, but do not need \nto speak Swedish. When we hear new slang expressions, on the other hand, we have to \nobserve their use in particular contexts (what they refer to), and their opposition to other \nterms in the structure of the language. We can read a map in two dimensions and take in \nthe merits of alternative routes, whereas a spoken set of directions gained from a local \ninhabitant unfolds through time (Mounin 1970: 35). \n Mounin attached particular importance to the unique \u201edouble articulation\u201f of \nlanguage, the distinction between phonemes and morphemes (Mounin 1970: 43-44, 52, \n74). The existence of a range of sounds (phonemes), which can be combined into a far \nlarger range of meaningful units (morphemes\/words) gives language its unique richness \nas a medium of communication. Gell rightly argues that icons and indexes lack this \ndouble articulation. Mounin distinguishes between systematic forms of communication \nsuch as language, musical notation and marine signal flags, and apparently non-\nsystematic forms such as the plastic arts and advertisements. Communication through \nnon-arbitrary signs does not require the same degree of systematization as language. \nIcons do not need to be chopped into discrete units; the width of a river on a map can \nvary continuously, according to the width of the river itself. Advertisements may use a \nrange of colours to catch the consumer\u201fs eye; a series of different advertisements can \nentice the consumer into buying the same product. A photograph of a refrigerator can \nchoose a variety of products to advertise its capabilities (Mounin 1970: 38). In the face of \nuncertainty about the nature or precision of rules, abduction may be the appropriate mode \nof interpretation, but some art traditions are more highly structured than others. \n 29 \nSemiology originated, not in linguistics, but in Durkheim\u201fs (1915) analysis of central \nAustralian art. As an unrepentant semiologist, I believe the distinctive features of art that \nGell has demonstrated cannot be explained by denying its status as visual expression, but \nrather by recognizing the inapplicability of a specifically linguistic model. \n \n8145 words (including endnotes, excluding pr\u00e9cis) \n 30 \nNOTES \n \n1.
