Methods and \nResults:  Real time PCR was used to amplify the nor-1 gene (target gene) and benA56 (\u03b2-\ntubulin gene), used as a control gene. Expression of three structural genes, nor-1 (=aflD), \nver-1 (=aflM), and omtA (=aflP), and the regulatory gene aflR of the aflatoxin biosynthetic \npathway were also assayed. There were significant differences between nor-1 gene \nexpression at the three aw levels; higher expression at 0.90 aw in weeks 1-3, when compared \nto 0.95. In contrast, in the driest treatment (0.85 aw) none or very low nor-1 expression \noccurred. The populations of A. flavus (CFUs g\n-1\n) increased over time with the highest at 0.95 \naw. Highest AFB1 production was at 0.90 and 0.95 aw from weeks 3-6.  Aw had a significant \neffect on aflR transcription at 0.95 aw over the 6 week period, while at 0.90 aw, only in the last \ntwo weeks.  \nConclusions: Correlations between different factors showed that log AFB1 x log CFUs, log \nAFB1 x aw, and log CFUs x aw were statistically significant; while log CFUs x RQ-PCR and \nRQ-PCR x aw were not. The AflR gene may not have an important role in regulation of nor-1 \nexpression in food matrices (e.g. peanuts).  \nSignificance and Impact of the study: Determination of correlations between nor-1 \nexpression and aflatoxin production by A. flavus in raw peanuts under different aw levels \ncould be helpful to predict potential risk of aflatoxin production during storage of this \nhygroscopic food product and minimise contamination with the AFB1. \n \n \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n3 \n \nIntroduction \nAflatoxin (AFA) contamination continues to be a serious problem in many parts of the world. \nA. flavus and A. parasiticus are known as pathogens of cotton, corn, peanuts and other oilseed \ncrops, producing toxins both in the field and during storage under various environmental \nconditions (Pittet 1988; Llewellyn et al. 1992; Cotty 1997; Payne and Brown 1998; \nBhatnagar et al. 2000; Horn 2007). The key environmental determinants pre- and post-\nharvest are water availability and temperature (Magan et al. 2003; Magan and Aldred 2007). \nThe biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, including mycotoxins, is significantly influenced \nby environmental conditions such as pH, water activity (aw) and temperature (Belli et al. \n2004; Hope et al. 2005). \nPreviously, Moubasher et al. (1980) examined the effect of  different moisture \ncontents (8.5-21 % on a dry-weight basis) and temperatures (5-45\no\nC) on A. flavus infection of \npeanuts stored for up to 6 months. Highest population counts of A. flavus was found in \npeanuts stored at 13.5 % moisture content (approx. 0.90 aw) at 15 \u00b0C for 1 month. Recently, a \nsurvey of Egyption peanuts by Sultan and Magan (2010) showed that Aspergillus section \nFlavi was consistently the most frequent genus in in-shell peanuts and was the dominant \nmycotoxigenic component of the mycobiota. However, in this two year survey, there was no \ndirect correlation between the moisture content of the samples and the fungal populations on \npeanut seeds from different regions. The major mycotoxins found in Egyptian peanuts are \naflatoxins (El-Maghraby and El-Maraghy 1987).  \n Molecular techniques have been applied for the detection of aflatoxigenic fungi in \nfood samples (Geisen 1996; Shapira et al. 1996; Mayer et al. 2003; Somashekar et al. 2004). \nTraditional methods used to assess the presence of mycotoxigenic fungi in food are \ndependent on selective media, which are only available for some mycotoxigenic species. \nHowever, knowledge of the ability of the fungus to activate mycotoxin biosynthesis genes \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n4 \n \nunder different environmental conditions may be a better indicator for determining the risk \nfrom specific mycotoxigenic species. Few studies have attempted to relate the expression of \nspecific mycotoxin biosythesis genes with phenotypic mycotoxin production under different \nenvironmental conditions. Some studies have attempted to integrate the correlation of \necophysiological conditions with gene expression and phenotypic toxin production (Schmidt-\nHeydt et al. 2007; Geisen et al. 2008; Jurado et al. 2008; Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2009).    \n It has been reported that at least 25 identified genes are clustered within a 70-kb DNA \nregion in the chromosome involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis (Yu et al. 2004). One of these is \nthe nor-1 (=AflD) gene which encodes an enzyme that catalyses the ketoreduction of \nnorsolorinic acid (the first stable pathway intermediate) to averantin (Chang et al. 1992; Trail \net al. 1994). Disruption of this gene in A. parasiticus resulted in norsolorinic acid (NA) \naccumulation (Chang et al. 1992), confirming the important function of the nor-1 (=aflD) in \nAFA synthesis and suggesting that NA is a substrate for this protein.  \nSeveral studies have measured the expression of genes involved in the AFA \nbiosynthetic pathway to distinguish between AFA producers and non-producers (Scherm et \nal. 2005; Degola et al. 2007; Rodrigues et al. 2009). Real-time RT-PCR is highly sensitive \nand allows quantification of rare transcripts and small changes in gene expression. Recently, \nPrice et al. (2005) used a whole genome microarray approach to analyse the influence of \nsubstrate composition and pH on the activation of AFA biosynthesis genes. Yu et al. (2004) \ndescribed the whole biosynthetic pathway and renamed the genes in the cluster. We have \nused the new names except for the nor-1 (=aflD) expression for comparison with previous \nstudies. \n Schmidt-Heydt and Geisen (2007) developed and used a mycotoxin gene microarray \nand Real-Time PCR to study the influence of physical parameters like water activity (aw), \ntemperature and pH on the expression of ochratoxin A, trichothecenes and AFA gene \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n5 \n \nclusters. Schmidt-Heydt et al. (2008) studied the effect of temperature and aw on growth and \nmycotoxin gene expression of several fungal species, including the AFA cluster of \nAspergillus  parasiticus. Recently, the influence of both parameters on AFA gene expression \nand aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) production by A. flavus was analysed (Schmidt-Heydt et al. 2009). \nThe ecology and regulation of AFA biosynthesis by A. flavus in relation to external factors \nhave also recently been summarized (Abbas et al. 2009; Georgian and Payne 2009). \nRecently, Passone et al. (2010) applied a real-time PCR system to detect and quantify the \nnor-1 gene of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway based on DNA analyses in relation to \nAspergillus section Flavi populations in stored peanuts.  \n The objectives of this study were to apply molecular tools and compare this with \ntraditional assessment methods and quantitative AFB1 analyses in monitoring temporal \nchanges in stored peanuts. Experiments were carried out with A. flavus inoculated peanuts \nstored at three aw levels (0.95, 0.90, 0.85)  to measure  (a) asexual reproduction of A. flavus \n(CFUs), (b) quantification of nor-1 (aflD) gene expression, (c) AFB1 production and (d) \ntranscription of four AFA genes nor-1 (aflD),ver-1 (aflM),  omtA (aflP), and AflR over a \nperiod of six weeks at 25\no\nC.  \n \nMaterials and methods \n Fungal strain and growth conditions: In this study, an aflatoxigenic strain of \nAspergillus flavus (EGP9) isolated from Egyptian peanuts has been used. This was compared \nwith a type strain of A. flavus SRRC G1907 provided by Dr. D. Bhatnagar, USDA and \nconfirmed to be taxonomically similar, and an aflatoxin B1 and B2 producer.  The strain was \nsub-cultured on Malt Extract Agar (20.0 g Malt extract (Difco), 2.0 g Peptone (Difco), 15.0 g \nAgar (Sigma) for 7 days at 25 \u00b0C in the dark.  \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n6 \n \n Inoculation of peanut samples: A moisture adsorption curve was prepared for \nshelled peanuts in order to accurately determine the amount of water required to add to obtain \nthe target aw levels. This curve was obtained by adding different quantities of water to \npeanuts, equilibration overnight, and then determining moisture content by drying at 130\u00b0C \nfor 12 hrs, and comparing this with the aw level measured with an AQUALAB \u00ae 3TE, USA. \nThis showed that   90 \u00b5l, 53 \u00b5l and 25.4 \u00b5l water per gram peanuts were required to reach the \ntarget aw levels of 0.95, 0.90 and 0.85 respectively.  \n One hundred g sub-samples of peanuts (three replicates per treatment) were put in \nglass jars covered with lids containing a microporous membrane and autoclaved at 121 \u00baC for \n20 min. After cooling, the water was added and after equilibration the peanut samples were \ninoculated with 1 ml of a 10\n6\n spores ml\n-1\n of A. flavus and vigorously shaken to coat the \npeanuts with spores and incubated at 25\u00b0C for six weeks in polyethylene sandwich boxes \ncontaining glycerol\/water solutions to maintain the equilibrium relative humidity conditions. \nSamples were destructively sampled every 7 days (approx 15 g of contaminated peanuts) and \ndivided into three parts: (a) 10 g for aflatoxin extraction, (b) 1 g for CFU determination and \n(c) 1 g for RNA extraction followed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR.  \n Determination of colony forming units (CFUs): The A. flavus total colony forming \nunits (CFUs) were determined by serial dilution and spread plating the different dilutions on \nMEA and incubating for 4-5 days before counting numbers of colonies. \n Aflatoxin extraction and HPLC analysis: 10 g of peanuts was extracted for AFA \nanalyses using an immunoaffinity column (Neogen, Europe Ltd). The residue was derivatized \nusing TFA (Triflouroacetic acid) as decribed by the AOAC (2000). Sample extracts were \nanalyzed using an Agilent 1200 series HPLC (Agilent, Berkshire, UK) using a 470 \nfluorescence detector (FLD, G1321A, Agilent) (\u03bbexc 360 nm; \u03bbem 440 nm) and a C18 column \n(Phenomenex Luna ODS2 150 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m). The analysis was performed using a mobile \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n7 \n \nphase of methanol:water:acetonitrile (30:60:10) at a flow rate of 1 ml\/min\n \nand a run time of \n25 mins. \n Isolation of RNA from the samples and RT-PCR: Total RNA was extracted from \ninoculated peanuts using the RNeasy and Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) \nwith minor modifications. 1 g peanuts was ground in a mortar with a pestle in the presence of \nliquid nitrogen, and 500\u03bcl of lysis buffer from the RNeasy kit and 0.5 g of \npolyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP). Insoluble PVPP binds to both polysaccharide and phenolic \ncompounds and prevents the undesirable binding between nucleic acids and these compounds \n(Chen et al. 2000). RNA extraction was then performed according to the instructions \nprovided by the manufacturer. RNA was treated with DNase I (RNase free DNase I, \nAmplification Grade, Sigma) to digest residual DNA in the samples.  \n The expression of three structural genes nor-1 (aflD), ver-1(aflM), and omtA (aflP), \nand the regulatory gene aflR of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway were assayed in all \ntreatments and replicates. The expression of the housekeeping gene (\u03b2-tubulin) was used as a \ncontrol (see Table 1). RT was performed with a Qiagen sensiscript \n\u00ae\n kit (Qiagen, UK) using \noligo-dT primers to amplify the mRNA. The reaction was assembled in a 20 \u00b5l tube as \nfollows: 1 \u00b5M Oligo(dT) primer, 1 x reaction buffer, 4U sensiscript Reverse Transcriptase, 2 \n\u00b5M dNTPs, 10 U RNase inhibitor , and 40 ng RNA sample in 12 \u00b5L H2O (RNase free). The \nmixtures was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min followed by 93\u00b0C for 5 min in a thermal cycler \n(Peltier Thermal cycler PTC-200 MJ Research), followed by rapid cooling on ice.  \n Each 25 \u00b5l PCR reaction contained  800 \u00b5M dNTPs, 1 x reaction buffer , 1.25 U  Taq \nDNA polymerase I, 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer, 1 \u00b5l cDNA mixture, 12 \u00b5L H2O (RNase and \nDnase free). PCR conditions were an initial denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 \ncycles of 30 s at 94 \u00b0C, 60 s at 65 \u00b0C and 90 s at 72 \u00b0C, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 7 \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n8 \n \nmin (Scherm et al. 2005). Primer sequences are detailed in Table 1. PCR products were \nvisualized on a UV transilluminator (Gene Genius Bio Imaging system).  \n TaqMan probes and primer design: Real Time RT-PCR was used to amplify the \nnor-1 gene (target gene) and benA56 (\u03b2-tubulin gene) as a control gene (Mayer et al. 2003). \nThe two primers and an internal fluorescence labelled probe used in the reaction were nortaq-\n1 5 -GTCCAAGCAACAGGCCAAGT-3 ; nortaq-2 5  -TCG TGCATGTTGGTGATGGT-3 ; \nnorprobe 6FAM TGTCTTGATCGC GCCCG- BHQ2; bentaq-1 5 -\nCTTGTTGACCAGGTTGTGGAT-3 ; bentaq-2 5 -GTCGCAGCCCTCAGCCT-3 , benprobe \nCY5-CGATGTTGTCCGTCGCGAGGCT-BHQ2.  \n Real-time PCR conditions: Amplification was performed using a total reaction \nvolume of 25 \u00b5l in a MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). For \neach reaction 12.5 \u00b5l of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 \u00b5l cDNA, \n3 \u00b5l of primer and probe mix (0.5 nM primer and 0.2 nM probe), and 7 \u00b5l of free RNases \nwater. Real Time reactions were performed using the Bio Rad CFX96 platform (Bio Rad) \nwith the following conditions: an initial step at 95 \u00baC for 10 min, and all 40 cycles at 95\u00baC for \n15 s, 55\u00baC for 20s and 72\u00baC for 30s. \n Relative quantification method: The efficiency of PCR (E) was calculated from \neach linear regression of standard curves of each target and control gene which was \ncalculated from the formula E= [10 \n(-1\/slope)\n -1] X 100 (Figure 1). This method compares the \nrelative amount of the target gene (nor-1) to control gene (benA56). The target and control \namplification were carried out in separate tubes in triplicate. Normalized relative quantity \n(NRQ) = E \nCt nor-1\n\/E \nCt benA56\n where E is the PCR efficiency for each target, Ct is the threshold \ncycle (Pfaffl 2001). Only the linear range was used for quantification. \n  Contour map of responses: The three dimensional (3D) response contour plot was \nemployed to determine the relationship between RQ-PCR data and aw in relation to the \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n9 \n \ntemporal storage period. The data was analysed using Statistica version 8 (StatSoft, Inc, 1984-\n2007) software. \n Statistical analysis: All experiments were carried out with 3-4 replicates and \nrepeated twice with similar results. Statistical tests were performed using Statistica version 8 \n(StatSoft, Inc, 1984-2007) for three-way ANOVA and LSD Fisher was determined at the \n95% confidence limits.  \n \nResults \n Effect of water activity on populations of A. flavus on stored peanuts: Figure 2 \nshows the temporal changes in A. flavus isolated from the three aw treatments. There was a \nrapid increase in viable propagules produced at 0.95 aw reaching a maximum at the end of the \nexperiment. At 0.90 aw, CFU numbers were <0.95 aw with a maximum total after 4 weeks \nincubation. As water stress was imposed, the populations of A. flavus isolated were \nsignificantly decreased (P=0.05).  Statistical analysis of the effect of single, and interaction \nconditions of aw, time and aw x time were statistically significant (Table 2a).  \n Effect of aw on aflatoxin production: Figure 2 also compares the temporal AFB1 \nproduction by A. flavus in the stored peanuts under different aw regimes. Overall, A. flavus \nproduced maximum amounts of AFB1 at 0.90 aw and 0.95 aw after 3 weeks storage.  The \nproduction of AFB1 was detected after 1 week storage at 0.95 and 0.90 aw. No increase in \nAFB1 production occurred at 0.85 aw when compared to the controls over the storage period.  \nTable 2b summarises the statistical significance of the single and two way interaction factors \nfor aw, time and aw x time which were all statistically significant. \n RQ-PCR of nor-1 in relation to water activity: The normalized relative quantity \n(NRQ) of nor-1 aflatoxin gene with the \u03b2-tubulin gene (housekeeping gene) of A. flavus in \npeanuts was analysed (see Figure 2). There was a significant differences between nor-1 \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n10 \n \nexpression at the three aw levels, There was higher expression at 0.90 aw especially during \nweeks 1-3, after which expression decreased. At 0.95, the expression was lower than at 0.90 \naw and the highest expression was after 3 weeks and then decreased further.  At 0.85 aw, there \nwas no nor-1 expression during the first two weeks and very low expression subsequently. \nSingle and interacting factors were all significant (Table 2c).  \n The data for nor-1 gene relative expression was analysed to examine whether there \nwas any pattern to production over time. Figure 3 shows the contour map for relative \nexpression of the nor-1 gene at different aw levels in relation to time. There is a clear \noptimum of expression at 0.90 during the first 2 weeks of storage, with less expression at \n0.95 and 0.85 aw and over time. This suggests some pattern with regard to relative expression \nof the nor-1 gene when A. flavus colonises peanuts. \n Analysis of aflatoxin gene transcription in relation to water activity: In this study \nthe transcription of four genes,  nor-1 (aflD), ver-1(aflM), and omtA (aflP), and aflR in the \nbiosynthetic pathway for AFB1  production were assessed (Figure 4). The expression of the \nhouse keeping gene (\u03b2-tubulin) was used as a control. Transcription of the genes was assayed \nby RT-PCR. To ensure there was no DNA contamination in the RNA, for each sample PCR \nwas performed following an RT reaction in the presence (+RT) or absence (-RT) of the \nreverse transcriptase enzyme. RT-PCR results revealed that at 0.95 aw, all four genes were \ntranscribed from the beginning to the end of the storage period. At 0.90 aw, aflD was \nexpressed from the start of the experiments while aflR only from 4 weeks onwards. The genes \naflP and aflM were expressed from the 2\nnd\n week onwards.  In the driest conditions tested \n(0.85 aw) only two genes were transcribed (aflD and aflM) after 3 weeks.  \n Correlation co-efficients for comparing different factors: Table 3 shows the results \nfrom examining the possible correlations between different treatment factors. There was a \ngood correlation between A. flavus CFUs and aw (R= 0.75: P= 0.00), AFB1 correlated \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n11 \n \nsignificantly with aw (R= 0.68; P= 0.00) and AFB1 x log CFUs (r=0.85. However, for other \nfactors there were no significant correlations. \n \nDiscussion \n This is one of the first studies to compare the influence of aw on relative quantification \nof the nor-1 gene in relation to CFUs, phenotypic aflatoxin production, and aflatoxin gene \ntranscription of A. flavus during storage of peanuts.  Quantification of the nor-1 gene \nexpression, based on the relative expression of this gene, versus a reference gene or \nhousekeeping gene (\u03b2-tubulin gene) provided useful information to relate molecular changes \nto ecophysiological parameters. Previously, Mayer et al. (2003) reported that the \u03b2-tubulin \ngene was constitutively expressed and constant during the subsequent growth phases when \ncompared with the expression of nor-1 gene of A. flavus.  \n Our results showed that temporal changes in asexual reproduction (CFUs) in relation \nto storage aw showed a good correlation (r=0.75; P =0.00). In the wettest condition tested \nmore rapid colonization and sporulation occurred reflecting the high log10 CFUs found. No \nstatistical correlation between A. flavus CFUs and the quantified nor-1 gene expression levels \n(r=0.175; P=0.09) was found. This may partially be because of the fact that at lowered aw \nlevels (e.g., 0.90) there was an increase in nor-1 gene expression although populations \n(CFUs) of A. flavus increased at a slower rate over the 6 week storage period. Recently, \nPassone et al. (2010) reported a good correlation (r=0.613; P<0.0001) between nor-1 gene \nexpression and CFUs in naturally stored peanuts over a period of 4 months for Aspergillus \nsection Flavi.  However, their study was based on DNA analyses of the nor-1 gene, not RNA \nexpression. Since all propagules contain the gene, the presence of nor-1, per se, may not \naccurately reflect expression and phenotypic production of aflatoxins.  \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n12 \n \n The only other recent study was that by Schmidt-Heydt et al. (2007) who examined \nPenicillium verrucosum populations and ochratoxin A (OTA) and the OTA polyketide \nsynthesis gene expression (otapksPv) in wheat stored at three water contents (14, 19 and \n24%) for up to three months. They showed good correlations between the otapksPv \nexpression, phenotypic OTA production and in some cases that this was paralleled by CFUs \nof P. verrucosum. \n  Overall, similar results were obtained by real time PCR at both 0.90 aw and 0.95 aw; \nwith high expression especially during the first three weeks, before expression slowed down. \nThe contour map of expression of nor-1 shows these changes clearly over storage time with \nthe optimum during the first few weeks of storage. There was thus a poor correlation between \nRQ-PCR data and AFB1 production (r= 0.488; p=0.000). This poor correlation is probably \ndue to the nor-1 expression being initiated very early, prior to phenotypic aflatoxin \nproduction being synthesised. Thus expression of the nor-1 transcripts may already be \ndecreasing as the increase in toxin production is detected (Mayer et al. 2003).  \nThe high sensitivity of the nor-1 (=aflD) gene expression in relation to changes in aw \nlevels during storage of peanuts can be easily determined by the real-time PCR system. This \ncould be a useful tool to improve food safety of peanuts and predict environmental condition \nthat we can use to inhibit or reduce expression of this important gene as well as aflatoxin \nproduction. Previously, Mayer et al. (2003) used a real-time reverse transcription-PCR \nsystem to\n \nmonitor the expression of the nor-1 gene of\n \nA. flavus in wheat. They found that the \ndescribed real-time PCR system\n \nwas able to completely characterize the mycological status of\n \nwheat as a model food matrix.   \n Several genes code for proteins involved in the aflatoxin biosynthesis pathway. \nAmong the 25 genes involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis, we selected three structural genes \naflD (early stage), aflM (middle stage), aflP (late stage) and the regulatory gene aflR  that \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n13 \n \nplays a role in controlling the level of structural gene expression (Woloshuk et al. 1994; \nChang 2004; Price et al. 2005) to measure their transcriptional status in relation to changes in \naw level during peanut storage.  \n Water activity had a significant effect on aflR transcription, especially at 0.90 aw, \nwhere it was transcripted from the 4\nth \nweek, while during the initial three weeks there was \nhigh expression of nor-1 gene, transcription of the structural genes and high aflatoxin \nproduction. This suggests that aflR may not have a role in regulation of structural gene \nexpression in food matrices such as peanuts. This contrasts with Degola et al. (2007) who \nreported that structural gene expression follows regulatory genes aflR and aflS transcription. \nIncomplete induction of these genes does not permit the detection of the structural gene \nexpression, even by RT- PCR. This may confirm the fact that gene expression may be \nvariable depending on physiological and environmental conditions.  \n Our results support those obtained by Schmidt-Heydt et al. (2009). They \ndemonstrated that at lowered aw (0.90) levels, the ratio of aflS\/aflR was decreased compared \nto the other genes of the cluster. Thus, although expression was high (including that of aflD), \nlow amounts of AFB1 were produced in vitro. In contrast, in peanuts a high amount of AFB1 \nwas produced. This may partially be because the present study was carried out directly on the \nfood matrix which may give different results from those on a conducive in vitro medium. \nHowever, in situ studies are critical to enable a better understanding of the ecophysiological \nand functional importance of specific regulatory genes to develop effective control \napproaches to minimise mycotoxin contamination of a range of important staple food \ncommodities. \n \n \n \nJournal of Applied Microbiology, Volume 109, Issue 6 (2010),1914-1922. \n \n14 \n \nAcknowledgements \nAhmed Abdel-Hadi is very grateful to Egyptian Higher Education Ministry and Al-Azhar \nUniversity, Assuit branch, for financial support. \n \nReferences \n Abbas, H.
