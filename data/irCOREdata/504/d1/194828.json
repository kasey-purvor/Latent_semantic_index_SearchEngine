We have also identified a third source as a possible counterpart,\nwhich lies 0.8 arcsec from the nominal X-ray position. Point spread function fitting photometry\nyields V-band magnitudes of 20.3, 22.0 and 22.4 for the three sources. The V \u2212 I band colours\nare 0.6, 0.1 and \u22120.2, respectively (i.e. the fainter sources are bluer). We find that all V \u2212 I\ncolours and luminosities are consistent with those expected for young stellar clusters (age\n<10 Myr).\nKey words: accretion, accretion discs \u2013 black hole physics \u2013 galaxies: photometry \u2013 galaxies:\nstar clusters \u2013 X-rays: binaries \u2013 X-rays: individual: NGC 5204 X-1.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nEinstein and ROSAT observations show that at high energies most\nnearby (spiral) galaxies are dominated by a relatively small number\nof discrete, compact, but highly luminous X-ray sources. These so-\ncalled ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) have luminosities of\nLx \u223c 1039\u20131041 erg s\u22121, far in excess of the Eddington limit for\nspherical accretion on to a neutron star (Roberts & Warwick 2000).\nNearly 20 per cent of ULXs appear to be associated with super-\nnova remnants (SNRs: Roberts et al. 2002), while the rest are thought\nto be powered by accretion on to a compact object. One possibil-\nity is that ULXs represent the missing class of intermediate-mass\n(102\u2013105 M\u0004) black holes (Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). How-\never, recent Chandra observations reveal a strong association be-\ntween ULXs and active star-forming regions (Fabbiano, Zezas &\nMurray 2001; Lira et al. 2002), which are far too young to con-\ntain massive black holes (King et al. 2001). Subsequently, at least\ntwo alternative scenarios have been proposed. In the first, ULXs\nare stellar-mass black hole binaries undergoing a period of super-\nEddington accretion (e.g. Watarai, Mizuno & Mineshige 2001;\nBegelman 2002). In the second, the apparent super-Eddington lu-\nminosities are due to the beamed X-ray emission from an other-\nwise normal intermediate\/high-mass X-ray binary (King et al. 2001;\nGeorganopoulos, Aharonian & Kirk 2002). While both scenarios tie\nin neatly with the observed association between ULXs and active\nstar-forming regions (Long, Charles & Dubus 2002; Terashima &\nWilson 2002; Zezas et al. 2002), the latter requires a significantly\nlarger number of ULXs to be present.\nRoberts et al. (2001) identified the first optical counterpart to a\nULX, NGC 5204 X-1, based on its Chandra position and optical\n\u0002E-mail: mrg@astro.soton.ac.uk\nmultifibre spectroscopy. The counterpart, located within 1 arcsec\nof the nominal Chandra position, displays a blue featureless con-\ntinuum and is surrounded by an ionized bubble of gas with a di-\nameter of some 360 pc (Pakull & Mirioni 2002). Here, we present\narchival Hubble Space Telescope\/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2\n(HST\/WFPC2) V- and I-band images of this source, together with\nan improved analysis of the multifibre data. These data allow us to\nplace more robust constraints on the nature of the counterpart, and\nthus obtain a deeper insight into the ULX phenomenon.\n2 H S T \/ W F P C 2 I M AG E S O F N G C 5 2 0 4 X - 1\nWe have obtained archival HST\/WFPC2 V- and I-band (F606W and\nF814W) images of the dwarf magellanic-type galaxy NGC 5204\n(Fig. 1, upper panel). These data (now public) were obtained as\npart of an ongoing HST\/WFPC2 snapshot survey of nearby dwarf\ngalaxies (Seitzer, Principal Investigator).\nThe HST\/WFPC2 V- and I-band images (Fig. 1, lower panel) show\nthat the optical counterpart can be resolved into at least two sources,\nhere designated HST-1 and HST-2, separated by 0.47 arcsec. We also\nidentify a third source designated HST-3, located 0.8 arcsec to the\neast of the nominal Chandra position. This source was not detected\nin the fibre data of Roberts et al. (2001), but because of its close\nproximity remains a possible counterpart to the ULX. The observed\nseparations correspond to distances of 10\u221216 pc at the distance of\nNGC 5204 (4.8 Mpc).\nWe have performed point spread function (PSF) fitting photom-\netry on the V- and I-band images using HSTPHOT (Dolphin 2000).\nUnfortunately, only one image was available in each filter, ham-\npering cosmic ray rejection. Given the difficulty of identifying\nreal point sources, we decided against iterative adjustment of the\nstandard PSFs of HSTPHOT on the basis of the fit residuals. The chip\npositions, RA, Dec., V- and I-band magnitudes (referenced to a\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS\nL68 M. R. Goad et al.\nFigure 1. Upper panel: HST WFPC2 V-band (left-hand side) and I-band (right-hand side) images of NGC 5204 showing the location of the optical counterpart.\nLower panel: enlarged V- and I-band images reveal that the optical counterpart is resolved into two components (HST-1 and HST-2) separated by \u223c0.47 arcsec.\nA third source (HST-3) is located 0.8 arcsec east of the nominal Chandra position. The 1.0 arcsec radius ring shows the formal error on the ULX position.\nNorth is up.\n0.5-arcsec aperture), colours and distances from the nominal Chan-\ndra position (\u0005) are quoted in Table 1 for each source.\nOur HSTPHOT photometry reveals that all sources are blue (i.e. F\u03bb\ndecreases with increasing \u03bb), consistent with the finding of Roberts\net al. (2001) for a single unresolved source. However, the two fainter\nsources are significantly bluer than HST-1. The combined magni-\ntudes of HST-1 and HST-2 are 20.1 in V and 19.6 in I, with a V \u2212 I\ncolour of 0.5. These magnitudes are referenced to a 0.5-arcsec aper-\nture, becoming 20.0 and 19.5 when corrected to infinite aperture.\nWe do not include HST-3 in the combined magnitude estimate, as\nit does not fall within the same fibre in the data of Roberts et al.\nThe best-fitting Chandra position for the ULX (determined us-\ning WAVDETECT: Freeman et al. 2002) \u2013 \u03b1 = 13h 29m 38.s61, \u03b4 =\nTable 1.

The 1\u03c3 er-\nror associated with the Chandra reference frame is \u00b10.6 arcsec\n(Aldcroft et al. 2000). However, errors of up to 1.0 arcsec are not\nuncommon when linking the Chandra and HST reference frames\n(see e.g. Grindlay et al. 2001). Thus, while HST-1 is the preferred\nlocation for the optical counterpart, neither HST-2 nor HST-3 can\nbe ruled out.\n3 C O M PA R I S O N W I T H W H T \/ I N T E G R A L\nM U LT I F I B R E S P E C T RO S C O P Y\nWe have reanalysed the optical multifibre data on NGC 5204 X-1\nfrom Roberts et al. (2001) with the aim of improving the photometric\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 335, L67\u2013L70\nThe optical counterpart of NGC 5204 X-1 L69\naccuracy of their spectrum. This allows a direct comparison of their\nresults with our new results from HSTPHOT. Our new analysis takes\nbetter account of fibre throughput corrections (using an improved\nthroughput image, with repeatability errors of <0.1 per cent) and\ncontamination by the night sky background. More importantly, we\nhave also tried to correct for diffuse emission from within the host\ngalaxy.\nThe reconstructed multifibre image of our source shows that emis-\nsion from the optical counterpart lies within a single central fibre\nand its surrounding nearest six neighbours. If we adopt the proce-\ndure followed by Roberts et al. (2001) and correct for night sky\nbackground only, we derive a V-band magnitude of 19.9. This is\n0.2 mag fainter than found by Roberts et al.; this difference is due\npartly to our improved throughput correction and partly to the use\nof a median (instead of a mean) night sky background.\nAs noted above, we have also tried to account for diffuse emis-\nsion from the host galaxy, which shows a clear west\u2013east gradient\n(see Fig. 1). We do this by taking a median of the local background\ncontinuum over 18 fibres arranged in a hexagonal ring \u223c3 arcsec\nfrom the source. This avoids including source flux in the back-\nground fibres. As in Roberts et al. (2001), the resultant spectrum\n(Fig. 2) is blue and featureless at the resolution of our instrument\n(6 A\u02da per two-pixel resolution element). However, removal of local\ngalaxy contributions results in a cleaner, fainter and marginally bluer\nspectrum. The measured flux near 5500 A\u02da translates to a V-band\nmagnitude of 20.4 \u00b1 0.1. This is 0.7 mag fainter than the magni-\ntude quoted by Roberts et al. and 0.4 mag fainter than that derived\n5000 6000 7000 8000\n0\n2\n4\n6\nFigure 2.

The open triangles represent\nthe derived V- and I-band fluxes for the combined sources as estimated from\nthe HST\/WFPC2 images.\nfrom the HST\/WFPC2 V-band image. The discrepancy between the\nWHT V-band flux estimate and that determined directly from the\nHST\/WFPC2 V-band image most likely results from the intermittent\npresence of high cloud during some of the ground-based observa-\ntions. This gives an indication of the accuracy of the absolute spectral\nflux calibration of the fibre data.\n4 T H E NAT U R E O F T H E U L X\nA N D I T S C O U N T E R PA RT\nRoberts et al. (2001) found that the optical counterpart to NGC\n5204 X-1 was unlikely to be a Galactic foreground object, but could\nnot rule out the possibility that it was a background BL Lac. This\nwas because the derived X-ray to optical slope, \u03b1ox \u2248 1.0, lies well\nwithin the parameter range occupied by BL Lacs. However, a recent\nmeasurement of the radio flux at 8.3 GHz with the Very Large Array\n(Wong 2002) shows the source to be radio-faint (<84 \u00b5J), yielding\nan upper limit to \u03b1ro < 0.08. This places the source well outside the\nparameter space occupied by BL Lacs and confirms the status of\nNGC 5204 X-1 as a bona fide ULX.\n4.1 ULXs in young star clusters?\nThe HST\/WFPC2 colours show that our composite WHT spectrum,\nwhich is dominated by the brighter and significantly redder source,\nmust flatten towards longer wavelengths. Based on the colours alone,\nHST-1 has an apparent spectral type F2\u2013F5, HST-2 is type A2, and\nHST-3 is type B5\u2013B6 (Zombeck 1990). The absolute magnitudes of\nthe three sources are Mv = \u22128.1 (HST-1), \u22126.4 (HST-2) and \u22126.0\n(HST-3), which at the bare minimum requires \u223c1\u20132 F supergiants,\n\u223c2\u20133 A2 supergiants and \u223c2\u20133 B5 supergiants respectively. How-\never, a much more likely scenario is that the colours are represen-\ntative of young stellar clusters. Indeed, there is increasing evidence\nto support such an idea. Zezas et al. (2002) find several instances\nof ULX\/young stellar cluster coincidences in the Antennae galax-\nies. Further, based on its location and colour, one of the two optical\ncounterparts to the known ULXs in NGC 4565 has been associ-\nated with a globular cluster located in the outer bulge of this galaxy\n(Wu et al. 2002).\nIn Fig. 3 we show V \u2212I colours as a function of age for three stellar\ncluster models. Each model assumes a single instantaneous burst of\nstar formation. The adopted stellar initial mass function (IMF) is\nhere represented by a power law with slope 2.35 between the low-\nand high-mass cut-offs and approximates the classical Salpeter IMF\n(Salpeter 1955), appropriate for most observations of star-forming\nregions. Two of the models are from the STARBURST99 models of\nLeitherer et al. (1999). For comparison, we also show the solar-\nmetallicity model of Bruzual & Charlot (1993), which highlights\nthe effect of adopting a smaller lower mass cut-off.\nIf each of our sources represents a stellar cluster, and the clusters\nare coeval, then Fig. 3 shows that the observed V \u2212 I band colours\nare broadly consistent with young stellar clusters with ages between\n106.6 and 107.3 yr. Furthermore, asuming that the clusters have the\nsame metallicities, then the low-metallicity model is inconsistent\nwith the V \u2212 I colour of HST-1, and the age constraint is tightened\nto between 106.6 and 106.9 yr. This time-scale is much shorter than the\nformation time-scale of a low-mass X-ray binary, \u223c108\u2013109 yr, but\nis consistent with the formation time-scale of an intermediate\/high-\nmass X-ray binary, \u223c107 yr (King et al. 2001).\nBy comparing the absolute V-band magnitudes with the V-\nband magnitudes predicted by the nuclear STARBURST99 models of\nLeitherer et al. (1999), we estimate the number of cluster members\nC\u00a9 2002 RAS, MNRAS 335, L67\u2013L70\nL70 M. R. Goad et al.\nlog10 Age (yrs)\nFigure 3.

The hatched regions indicate\nthe V \u2212 I colours of our three sources.\nto be between several hundred (HST-3) and a few thousand stars\n(HST-1). We note that the upper limits to our source \u2018sizes\u2019 (a few\nparsecs at the distance of NGC 5204) are consistent with cluster\nsizes determined for nearby starburst galaxies (2\u20133 pc, see Meurer\net al. 1995).\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe have used archival HST\/WFPC2 V- and I-band images to show\nthat the previously reported optical counterpart to the ultralumi-\nnous X-ray source NGC 5204 X-1 can be resolved into two sources\nseparated by 0.47 arcsec. We have also identified a third possi-\nble counterpart 0.8 arcsec east of the nominal Chandra position.\nAll three sources appear blue (i.e. F\u03bb decreases with increasing\n\u03bb), with the fainter sources being significantly bluer. PSF fitting\nphotometry with HSTPHOT yields source magnitudes of 20.3, 22.0\nand 22.4 in V. Assuming that all three sources are coeval, the\nV \u2212 I band colours suggest that NGC 5204 X-1 lies within a young\n(<10 Myr) stellar cluster. This is consistent with the idea that ULXs\nare intermediate\/high-mass X-ray binaries.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nThis work is based on observations made with the NASA\/ESA Hub-\nble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space\nTelescope Science Institute.
