Introduction\nIn a recent paper on \u2018Multi-element signatures of stream sediments and sources under\nmoderate to low flow conditions\u2019, Stutter et al. (2009) presented results of a simple\nsediment source tracing method based on major and trace elements for a small agricul-\ntural catchment in north-east Scotland. The authors reported statistically significant,\nlarger concentrations of four trace elements (Ce, Nd, Th and Y) in bank subsoils (n=5)\nand stream bed sediments (n=3) compared to topsoils from both pasture (n=5) and\narable (n=5) land. They used these differences to aid discrimination between topsoil\nand subsoil (stream bank erosion) contributions to bed sediment. These elements may\nbe more depleted in topsoil compared to subsoil because the former have been subject\nto more intense weathering over a longer period. If these naturally occurring trace\nelements could be used to understand the relative proportions of topsoil and subsoil\ncontributions to headwater bed sediments this approach might be applied more widely\nto elucidate transport pathways for the transfer of agricultural contaminants such as\nparticulate phosphorus to streams (Walling et al., 2008). This approach warrants fur-\nther investigation across a range of catchments at different scales with contrasting land\nuse and bedrock types. This can be undertaken using data from regional-scale geo-\nchemical surveys (Johnson et al. 2005) which include analyses of both stream bed\n1\nsediments and subsoil samples. Previous studies have shown that much of lowland\ncentral England is at risk of topsoil transfer to watercourses via land drains (Chapman\net al., 2003). A geochemical survey across part of central England covering 15 400 km2\nwas recently undertaken and these data are well-suited to testing whether three of the\nfour trace elements identified by Stutter et al. might be used to discriminate between\ntopsoil and subsoil in sediments more widely. Specifically, if the concentrations of these\nelements are significantly smaller in stream bed sediments than in the subsoil, this may\nbe due to mixing with topsoils which have lower concentrations of these elements. Be-\nlow I describe the regional-scale survey, the methods I used to compare the geochemical\ndata in subsoil and bed sediments, and I discuss my findings and their implications.\n2. Regional-scale geochemical survey\nThe soil and stream sediment sampling was undertaken across the same large region\nof central England during the summers of 1997, 1998 and 1999 in rural and peri-urban\nareas; the coordinates of the region are between 400 and 540 km (Easting) and between\n235 and 345 km (Northing) on the British National Grid. Elevation across the region\nis between 20 and 255 m above sea level, with undulating topography. Bedrock in\nthe study region ranges in age from Precambrian to Cretaceous with a wide range\nof predominantly sedimentary lithologies including limestones, sandstones, siltstones,\nmudstones, shale, coal measures, marls, ironstones and chalk. There are also extensive\nsuperficial deposits including glacial tills, glacial sands and gravels, marine and river\nalluvium, river terrace deposits, and to the east of the region, peat deposits (Sylvester-\nBradley and Ford, 1968). Land use is dominated by agriculture: 48% arable and 21%\ngrassland.\nSoil sampling locations (n=7288) were chosen from alternate kilometre squares\nof the British National Grid by simple random selection within each square, subject\nto the avoidance of roads, tracks, railways, urban areas and other seriously disturbed\nground. At each site, a soil sample was taken from between 35 and 50 cm from five\nholes augered at the corners and centre of a square with a side of length 20 m by a\n2\nhand auger and combined to form a bulked sample. All samples of soil were dried and\ndisaggregated and sieved to finer than 150\ud707m.\nMainly first and second order streams sites were selected, either avoiding or lo-\ncated upstream of obvious sources of contamination such as road intersections and farm\nbuildings. Where possible, sediment was collected from central areas of active stream\nbeds after removal of the upper layer of oxidised sediment. Between 15 and 25 kg of\nsediment was wet-screened on site to collect the fraction finer than 150\ud707m typically\nyielding a final mineral mass of approximately 500 g. On return to the laboratory, all\nbed sediment samples were freeze-dried, coned and quartered and a 50-g sub-sample\nwas ground in an agate planetary ball mill. The total concentrations of major and\ntrace elements including Ce, Th and Y were determined in each sample by wavelength\nand energy dispersive XRFS (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry). From a larger set of\nstream sediment sites from which bed sediment was collected, I selected a subset of the\nsmallest (< 10km2 catchments sediment sites (n=1005) comprising only: i) first and\nsecond order streams, ii) low to moderate flow conditions (at the time of sampling)\nand, iii) small channels with widths of between 1 and 3 metres.\n3. Estimating subsoil trace element concentrations in each drainage catch-\nment\nI examined the distributions of the concentrations of the three elements in the subsoil\nand stream sediment. Each distribution was positively skewed and so I took natural\nlogarithms of each to transform them to approximately normal distributions.\nI used a 5 m resolution digital terrain model (DTM; Intermap, 2009) of the\nstudy region and hydrological functions in ArcMap9.3TM(ESRI) to generate drainage\nnetworks. I then superimposed on this the locations of each of the 1005 sediment sam-\npling sites and snapped these to the nearest stream, ensuring that where two streams\nwere close together, the correct stream had been selected by reference to positions\nwhich had been recorded on hardcopies of Ordnance Survey maps during sample col-\nlection. I then used hydrological functions and the DTM to delineate polygons of the\n3\n1005 sub-catchment areas draining to each of the sampling sites. I identified the central\nlocations of the drainage catchment polygons using the \u2018centroids\u2019 function in the GIS.\nI then used ordinary kriging to make optimal estimates of subsoil concentrations of\nthe three elements at the central positions of the 1005 catchments where bed sediments\nhad been sampled. Using the data on the log transformed concentrations of each\nelement in subsoils across the region (n=7288), I calculated semivariances using lag\nintervals of 1 km to a maximum lag distance of 40 km and fitted both exponential and\nspherical functions to them. I checked for any substantial anisotropy by calculating\nvariograms in four directions, but none was apparent in the data so I proceeded by\nusing isotropic variograms. In each case I found an exponential function was optimal\nwhen fitted to the semivariances; the models had nugget:sill ratios of between 50 and\n52% showing that there was a substantial proportion of spatially correlated variance\nin the data. I used these functions to make ordinary kriged estimates (Webster and\nOliver, 2007) of Ce, Th and Y in subsoil at the centre of each catchment using the log\ntransformed data. The final data were a set of 1005 paired concentrations (log scale)\nof Ce, Th and Y in subsoil at the centre of each catchment and in its bed sediment.\n4. Comparison of subsoil and bed sediment geochemical data\nAs might be expected the subsoil and sediment concentrations of Ce, Th and Y were\nlinearly related (Pearson correlations coefficients \ud45f = 0.5, 0.54 and 0.41, respectively)\nand each linear relationship was statistically significant (\ud443 -value <0.001). I calculated\nmean and standard deviations for each element in each media. In the case of Ce and Y,\ntheir mean log concentrations in stream sediment (4.49 and 3.41) were slightly larger\nthan in subsoil (4.46 and 3.38). In the case of Th, the log mean concentration in\nsubsoil (2.34) was slightly larger than in sediment (2.33). I applied a one-sided, paired\n\ud461-test to the two Th distributions (n=1005); the mean subsoil Th concentration was\nnot significantly larger then the mean Th concentration in stream sediment at the 95%\nconfidence level (\ud443 -value=0.734). The standard deviations of each of the three, paired\ndistributions were very similar.\n4\n5. Discussion\nEvidence from geochemical surveys across a large area of agricultural central England\ndemonstrate that subsoil concentrations of Ce, Th and Y are not substantially greater\nthan in the same, fine size fraction (< 150\ud707m) stream bed sediments in many (n=1005)\nsmall headwater catchments. The mean concentrations in both media were very similar\nfor each of the three elements. It is therefore unlikely that these elements could be\nused to discriminate topsoil and subsoil inputs to stream beds across this region. This\ncontrasts strongly with the results of Stutter et al. (2009) who reported significantly\nhigher concentrations of these elements in bank subsoil than in stream bed sediment.\nDifferences in parent material types between the two regions may go some way to ex-\nplaining this; the study area of Stutter et al. is dominated by igneous bedrock (gabbro\nto granite) whilst the East Midland region largely comprises sedimentary lithologies. It\nis conceivable that soil formation processes are different in these two regions. Also, the\nsubsoil samples from the regional survey were from sites across the entire landscape and\nnot from the stream bank locations sampled by Stutter et al., but I would not expect\nthis to cause significant differences between their geochemical compositions. Finally,\nsediment dynamics in the Scottish study site may be somewhat different resulting in\ndifferent bed sediment particle size distributions \u2013 and by association, geochemical\ncomposition \u2013 in comparison to the catchments in the East Midlands. In summary, the\nresults of my analysis based on data from 1005 catchments suggest that discrimination\nof soil-related source contributions to headwater bed sediments based on Ce, Th and\nY concentrations is unlikely to be widely applicable.\nAcknowledgements\nThis comment is published with the permission of the Executive Director of the British\nGeological Survey (Natural Environment Research Council).
