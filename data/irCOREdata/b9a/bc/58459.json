Introduction\n[2] Coastal flooding is caused by high water levels that\nare generated by the combined effect of tides and storm\nsurges. Often the overtopping of coastal defenses by waves\naccompanies such conditions [Wolf, 2008]. The risk of\ncoastal flooding in low\u2010lying areas is likely to increase in\nthe future in response to global warming and climate change\n[e.g., Houghton, 2005; Lowe and Gregory, 2005; Lowe et\nal., 2001], as a result of future sea level rise combined\nwith an increase in the intensity and frequency of storms.\nStorm winds over England and Wales have the following\ndirectional dependencies: 29% SW, 30% W, 21% NW, and\n12% S, where the directions represent from where the wind\nhas come [Lamb, 1991]. The shallow eastern Irish Sea is\nsusceptible to large storm surges [Wolf, 2008], which at\nLiverpool can reach up to 2.5 m [Pye and Blott, 2008] as a\nresult of storm winds and low\u2010pressure systems. A major\nsurge at Liverpool is likely to occur if a secondary depres-\nsion with a speed of \u223c40 knots approaches such that its rear\u2010\nright quadrant (defined in Figure 2) can act over a long fetch\n[Lennon, 1963]. Other factors which also contribute to a\nmajor surge are whether the depression can be represented\nas an independent, concentric system with a radius of \u223c150\u2013\n200 nautical miles and if a pressure gradient of 30 mb over\n250 nautical miles is present in the rear\u2010right quadrant\n[Lennon, 1963]. For surges in the eastern Irish Sea the flow\ninto the Irish Sea through the North Channel and Celtic Sea\n(the external surge) is about equally as important as the\nlocally generated surge [Jones and Davies, 1998]. The large\ntidal range in Liverpool Bay (\u223c10 m on spring tides) causes\na significant tide\u2010surge interaction. This large tidal range\nreduces the risk of the peak surge occurring at high water\n[Horsburgh and Wilson, 2007]. Details on tide\u2010surge in-\nteraction are given by Prandle and Wolf [1978] and Wolf\n[2009]. The largest waves and surges in Liverpool Bay are\ngenerated by westerly and northwesterly winds which have\nthe longest fetch (Figure 1). Liverpool Bay is sheltered from\nswell waves from the Atlantic and experiences locally wind\u2010\ngenerated sea. The Coastal Flooding by Extreme Events\n(CoFEE) project and European Union (EU) FP7 Morpho-\nlogical Impacts and Coastal Risks induced by Extreme\nstorm events (MICORE) project are investigating the flood\nrisks in the eastern Irish Sea\/Liverpool Bay. This study area\nincludes many of England\u2019s coastal types and the project\nfocuses on the management of the Sefton coast (between the\n1Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Liverpool, UK.\nCopyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148\u20100227\/10\/2009JC005662\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 115, C05018, doi:10.1029\/2009JC005662, 2010\nC05018 1 of 12\nRibble and Mersey estuaries) with its mobile dunes. The\npast, present, and future flood risk posed by extreme events\nis being investigated using surge and wave models [Wolf et\nal., 2008; Brown et al., 2009a]. Previously, an extreme\nevent in November 1977, which coincided with tidal high\u2010\nwater overtopping coastal defenses throughout Lancashire\nand Cumbria, has been hindcast to represent a past extreme\nsurge event [Brown and Wolf, 2009]. This event and a\nsevere event in January 2007, for which both wave and surge\ndata were available, have been used to initially validate\nand tune the coupled Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory\nCoastal Modelling System\u2010WAve Model (POLCOMS\u2010\nWAM) set up for the eastern Irish Sea [Brown and Wolf,\n2009], prior to a long\u2010term (11 year) hindcast [Brown et al.,\n2010b]. It is known that the largest recorded surge at\nLiverpool at total high water was 1.98 m in January 1976.\nThis resulted in a high water level of 5.56 m above the mean\ntidal level (MTL). However, the largest surges generally\noccur during lower water levels. The largest recorded surge\nachieved 2.47 m in February 1990. At Heysham, larger\nsurges and tidal levels occur. The largest surge recorded\nwas 2.6 m in February 1990 and the highest\u2010observed tide\nexceeded 6.46 m (MTL) in February 1983; unfortunately\nthe tide gauge failed during the peak tidal level. Since the\n1990s the frequency and magnitude of extreme high water\nlevels for the eastern Irish Sea has increased [Pye and Blott,\n2008]. Waves have only been recorded continuously since\nOctober 2002, and the data show that waves exceed 3 m\nduring 5\u201310 events per year and 4 m during 1\u20135 events per\nyear. The 1 in 50 year wave height is about 5.5 m [Wolf,\n2008]. Over the last 25 years the maximum wave height\nacross the North Atlantic is thought to have increased\n[Carter, 1999]. The changes in extreme surges and waves\ncould be linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and\nin particular the strength of the prevailing westerly winds\n[Woodworth et al., 2007;Wolf and Woolf, 2006]. The foot of\nthe Sefton dunes lies just above the mean spring high water\nlevel. Consequently, during the largest tides and mean spring\ntides combined with a storm surge, waves can break directly\nonto the dune frontage [Pye and Neal, 1994]. Significant\ndune erosion along the Sefton coastline has resulted from\nindividual extreme storms, some of which lasted for more\nthan a single high water, that occurred in 1961, 1965, 1967,\n1968, 1975, 1976, 1983, 1990, 1997, 2002, and 2004 [Pye\nand Blott, 2008]. The most damaging storms occurred in\nNovember 1977, January 1983, and February 1990 [Pye and\nNeal, 1994]. During the 1977 [Jones and Davies, 1998] and\n1990 [Pye, 1991] events the damage was due to winds\nveering west from the southwest generating extreme surge\nand wave conditions. To project the future risk of erosion\nand flooding, extreme value theory [Coles and Tawn,\n2005] and joint probability of waves and water level\n[Hawkes et al., 2002] need to be considered. The return\nperiods for both waves and water level and the joint proba-\nFigure 1. The Irish Sea model domain.

The Sefton coastline extends from Liver-\npool to the Ribble Estuary.\nBROWN ET AL.: A DECADAL\u2010SCALE INVESTIGATION OF STORMS C05018C05018\n2 of 12\nbility of occurrence of extreme conditions for Liverpool and\nHeysham have been determined by Brown et al. [2010b].\n[3] In order to investigate the present\u2010day flood risk posed\nby extreme events, we use an 11 year period (1996\u20132006) of\nmodel hindcast data combined with long\u2010term data sets\ncollected across the Irish Sea [Brown et al., 2010b], as\npresented in section 2. A methodology is presented to ana-\nlyze the data to investigate what causes the most extreme\ntide\u2010surge residuals, filtered surge residuals, and wave\nheights. These factors can be used to determine regional\nflood risk and coastal erosion. The most significant surge\nand wave events are selected in section 3. The meteoro-\nlogical conditions driving these events are then discussed in\nsection 4, followed in section 5 by a conclusion on the\nfactors generating severe flood risk conditions in Liverpool\nBay.\n2. Method\n[4] To determine the most extreme flood risk conditions\nin the eastern Irish Sea we use observed and modeled data\nfrom an 11 year period (1 January 1996\u20131 January 2007).\nTo simulate the waves, we use the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art third\u2010\ngeneration spectral wave model [WAM, Komen et al.,\n1994], modified for shallow water [Monbaliu et al., 2000].\nIn order to accurately simulate the waves and the surge in\nthe study area, a one\u2010way nested modeling approach has\nbeen set up. For waves, a 1\u00b0 North Atlantic model forces the\nboundary of a 1.85 km Irish Sea model, using WAM. Any\ninfluence that swell might have in the study area will\ntherefore be correctly represented. The tide and surge is\nsimulated using the POLCOMS [Holt and James, 2001]. To\ncapture the external surge effects generated outside of the\nIrish Sea the 1\/9\u00b0 by 1\/6\u00b0 Operational Continental Shelf\nsurge model [CS3, Williams and Flather, 2000]) provides\nboundary forcing to the 1.85 km Irish Sea POLCOMS\nmodel. The coarse WAM model was driven by 1\u00b0 resolution\nERA\u201040 data provided every 6 h. The other models were\nforced by \u223c12 km resolution wind and pressure data pro-\nvided hourly by the UK Met Office mesoscale atmospheric\nmodel. The models were validated using data collected from\nwave buoys and coastal tide gauges around the United\nKingdom [Brown et al., 2010b]. For the Irish Sea a coupled\nPOLCOMS\u2010WAMmodel was used to capture the wave\u2010tide\u2010\nsurge interaction. This allows the waves to be refracted by\ntime varying current and depth fields, while the surface stress\nand bottom friction in the tide\u2010surge simulation are modified\nby the presence of waves. Tidally varying water elevation\nalso has a significant impact on the surge residual. Prior to the\n11 year hindcast, the coupled model was set up by Brown and\nWolf [2009] to simulate valid model hindcast results in\nthe eastern Irish Sea using two extreme storm events in\nNovember 1977 and January 2007.\n[5] Analysis of the 11 year wave\u2010tide\u2010surge model hind-\ncast and observed data provide us with insight into what\ncauses the most severe conditions in Liverpool Bay (defined\nin Figure 1), and in particular along the Sefton coastline.\nTide gauge data collected at Liverpool and Heysham, which\nare ports at either end of the Sefton coastline, have been\nused to isolate the most extreme surge events that have\noccurred in the last decade. Extreme wave conditions are\nalso investigated at the Liverpool Bay wave buoy location\n(53\u00b031\u203289N, 3\u00b022\u203228W). Owing to limited wave data (from\nOctober 2002 onward) model hindcast data has mainly been\nused to determine the most severe wave conditions in\nLiverpool Bay. The model results were validated by Brown\net al. [2010b] to show good agreement with observation.\nTo determine the wind conditions that generate extreme\nwave and storm surge conditions in the eastern Irish Sea we\nlook at the peak wind velocity, from the mesoscale model\ndata, at an offshore location (53\u00b045\u2032N, 4\u00b054\u2032W). This\nprovides us with an idea of the wind conditions blowing\nover the adjacent sea generating the local wave and surge\nconditions.\n[6] We use the tide\u2010surge residual (meaning the additional\nwater level on top of the predicted tide level) to examine the\npotential for coastal flooding at high water. This residual is\nthe result of surge\u2010tide interaction as well as meteorological\nforcing, the tidal interaction modifying both the timing and\nsize of the peak surge. This quantity provides information\nabout the increase or decrease in the actual water level at all\nstates of the tide compared with the predicted astronomical\ntidal level due to the surge and tide\u2010surge interaction. This\nresidual is useful in dune management, since the period over\nwhich the water level exceeds the dune toe is important. We\nalso use the filtered surge, defined as the residual water level\nafter all periodic signals (tidal influence and storm period-\nicity within a tidal period) are removed. This residual is due\nto the meteorological event only. Filtering is achieved by\npassing the total water elevation through the MATLAB\nfiltering routine \u201cfiltfilt.\u201d This performs zero\u2010phase digital\nfiltering removing the tidal signal between the M4 (\u223c6 h)\nand O1 (\u223c24 h) tidal periods. Comparison of the magnitude\nand timing of these surge residuals during extreme events\nprovides insight into how important the tide\u2010surge interac-\ntion is within a region. The \u201cskew surge\u201d [see de Vries et al.,\n1995] is also briefly investigated. This quantifies the amount\nby which the maximum water level exceeds the predicted\ntidal high water, a quantity that is important in coastal flood\nmanagement. Finally the most extreme high water event at\nLiverpool and Heysham is investigated in order to determine\nwhat conditions (tidal range, filtered surge, tide\u2010surge)\ngenerated the worst flood risk conditions in the last decade\nwithin this study area. Wave setup has not been included\nhere, but can reach 0.3 m locally [Wolf, 2008]. This will be\ninvestigated in further research for this location.\n3. Extreme Events in the Eastern Irish Sea\n[7] This section presents the most extreme events that\nhave occurred in the eastern Irish Sea over the past 11 years\n(1996\u20132006, inclusive). For each event the wind conditions\nare analyzed to determine what conditions (wind directions)\nare most likely to pose a flood risk in the future. The five\nlargest wave events and five largest surge events are studied\nfurther in section 3.3. The events are named in Tables 1 and 2\nas T1\u2013T10 depending on when they occurred in time; in\nmost, but not all cases, the names occur in both tables since\nthe extreme wave and surge events occurred simultaneously.\n3.1. Extreme Surge Events\n[8] We define a major surge event along the Sefton\ncoastline as a tide\u2010surge residual elevation greater than 1.5 m\nat either Heysham or Liverpool. This elevation is chosen\nBROWN ET AL.: A DECADAL\u2010SCALE INVESTIGATION OF STORMS C05018C05018\n3 of 12\nsince it is exceeded approximately 20 times in 11 years\n[Brown et al., 2010b]. An extreme surge is considered to\nhave an elevation of 2.1 m or greater, since such events only\noccur twice in 11 years [Brown et al., 2010b]. Using tide\ngauge data at these two locations, we find 16 major surge\nevents that occurred in the last 11 years of which 4 are\nclassed as extreme (Table 1). Out of these 16 events only\n14 have data at both locations.\n[9] From the long\u2010term observations (Table 1) we find\nthat the largest tide\u2010surge residuals along the Sefton coast-\nline can reach 2.43 m and occur due to winds from the south\nto the west. Wave heights accompanying these surge events\nare in the range 2.5\u20135.6 m. Often the waves are not con-\nsidered extreme (defined in section 3.2) during extreme\nsurge events at these locations (i.e., there are few underlined\nvalues in Table 1).\n3.2. Extreme Wave Events\n[10] Major wave events are defined as significant wave\nheights greater than 4 m. Brown et al. [2010b] found such\nevents to occur 15 times in 11 years. Extreme events are\nconsidered to have heights above 5.4 m, as these conditions\nare only achieved twice in 11 years [Brown et al., 2010b].\nThese major events occur due to winds between the direc-\ntions of west\u2013southwest and west\u2013northwest (Table 2).\nWaves in the area are mainly the result of local wave gen-\neration. Waves propagating into the Irish Sea from the\nSouthwest Approach very rarely penetrate into Liverpool\nBay. Wave propagation through the North Channel is\nrestricted and sheltering from Wales may prevent significant\nexternal wave propagation into the eastern Irish Sea. Thus\nlocal wave generation is limited by the short fetches to\nLiverpool Bay across the northern Irish Sea.

This is larger\nthan the more frequently generated waves (4\u20135 m) in the\nlast decade due to weaker west\u2013southwesterly through to\nnorthwesterly wind conditions. These waves have the\nlongest periods, but are still locally generated according to\ncoastal engineering formulae [see Hurdle and Stive, 1989].\nAssuming waves in Liverpool Bay have a maximum fetch\nof 200 km in a depth of 20 m (approximate depth at wave\nbuoy), then a wind of 29 m\/s can generate waves between\n5.47\u20135.67 m with periods between 9.67\u201311.57 s. The largest\nwaves are generated by the strongest winds (Table 2), but the\nwind duration and wind speed over fetches between the\nsouthwest to northwest will determine the peak wave con-\nditions. For example, the waves on 26 December 1998 are\nsmaller than on 24 December 1997. Even though the peak\nwind from west\u2013southwest was stronger on 26 December\n1998 it veered more westerly during the peak wind condi-\ntions on the 24 December 1997. The winds are often stronger\nwhen blowing from a southwest to west\u2013southwest direction,\ngenerating larger wave heights (Table 2). Such conditions\nlead to extreme waves combined with extreme surge, since\nthis is when the most significant surge is also generated (see\nsection 3.1).\n3.3. Storm Tracks\n[12] Here the storm track is based on the central low\u2010\npressure location as a storm moves across the British Isles\n(Figure 2). The storm tracks for the five largest wave events\nand five largest tide\u2010surge residuals at Heysham and\nLiverpool have been investigated (see Figures 3\u20135). These\nstorms named T1\u2013T10 are identified in Tables 1 and 2. This\nprovides insight into which storms will cause the largest\nwaves and additional water levels on top of the tide. We\nfind similar results to Lennon [1963], as follows. The surge\nperiod is transitory with a period of 6\u201312 h. The largest\nsurge conditions are generated by storms which track from\nwest to northeast across the British Isles (Figures 3 and 4).\nIn most cases large waves are also generated with these\nstorm events (see Table 1) and even extreme wave events\n(e.g., T3, T4, and T10; Figure 5). The position of the storm\nalong its track at peak wave and peak surge levels is differ-\nent; since extreme wave generation depends on a westerly\nwind and extreme surge generation is dependant on a more\nsouthwesterly wind. Storms tracking from north to east along\nthe eastern side of Britain (T9; Figure 5) or with a significant\neasterly component along the north coast of Scotland (T1;\nFigure 5) can generate extreme waves. The associated surge\nmay or may not be considered extreme (see Table 2) de-\npending on the track the storm takes. The position of the\nstorm at the time of peak surge or waves is to the northeast of\nthe British Isles.\n[13] We find the storms that generate major surges at\nHeysham (Figure 3) have a more northerly position in their\ntrack compared with Liverpool (Figure 4). The tracks do not\ndirectly cross the Irish Sea, only the North Channel. Surge\ngeneration occurs at Liverpool (Figure 4) if the storm track\ncrosses the northern or eastern Irish Sea. There are two\nexceptions to this (T2 and T4; Figure 4), when depressions\nwest of Ireland move northeast past the same latitude as\nLiverpool generating a significant external surge component\nto the eastern Irish Sea. We cannot track the initial positions\nof these two tracks since they are outside the boundaries\nof the available data. As found by Lennon [1963] the\nposition of the storm at peak surge is to the northeast of\nthe British Isles. This is when the wind in the rear\u2010right\nquadrant of the storm has local surge\/wave generating\ncapability due to its direction (Figure 2). The speed of the\nstorm also seems to affect the size of the surge. Fast\u2010moving\nstorms, before the peak in the surge, continue to act on the\n(external) surge as both surge and storm propagate toward\nthe coast, therefore the surge becomes more extreme. For\nexample, T4, T6, T8, and T10 are fast traveling and cause\nthe majority of the largest surges at Heysham and\/or\nLiverpool.\n[14] Extreme wave events in Liverpool Bay are often\ngenerated by the same storms that generate significant sur-\nges at both Liverpool and Heysham. Their tracks are north\nof Liverpool Bay passing across or to the north of the North\nChannel. But they are also generated by storms with a\nmarked easterly component in their track moving north of\nthe Irish Sea (T1; Figure 5) and by storms moving to the\nsoutheast (T9; Figure 5). During these storms the winds are\nmainly between the northwest and west. Surges due to\nnorthwesterly winds, e.g., the surge on the 13\u201315 November\n1977, can reach \u223c1.5 m at Liverpool [Jones and Davies,\n1998], but very rarely exceed this level. This is a conse-\nquence of the North Channel restricting the external surge\npropagating into the eastern Irish Sea. T1 in Table 1 is the\nonly extreme surge (>1.5 m) observed (at Liverpool alone)\nover the 11 year period due to an initially northwesterly\nwind. In this case the wind backs to the southwest for a short\nduration at the time of peak surge, but rapidly veers to the\nFigure 2.

The arrows on the pressure system represent the wind\ndirection.\nBROWN ET AL.: A DECADAL\u2010SCALE INVESTIGATION OF STORMS C05018C05018\n5 of 12\nwest generating the peak in wave height. In the case of\nstorm T9, two storms track around the British Isles, which is\nwhy there is a break in the track as one storm diminishes and\nthe second grows. Although the first storm generates west-\nerly winds it is thought that the second storm has more\nimpact on wave growth as it moves closer to the British\nIsles. For this storm only a low (locally generated) surge\noccurs since the storm was badly positioned for external\nsurge generation into the eastern Irish Sea. The location of\nthe storm at the time of peak wave activity is either close to\nthe east coast of Scotland or further offshore in the North\nSea. The speed of the storm has less affect on the wave\nconditions. T4 is the only fast moving storm before the peak\nin wave heights, but many storms, e.g., T3, T4, T9, and T10\ngenerate extreme waves (>5 m).\n4. Tidal Effects\n[15] At Liverpool it is known that large surges generally\navoid tidal high water (HW) and occur more frequently on\nthe rising tide, especially under spring tide conditions, due\nto the tide\u2010surge interaction. The annual maximum HW\nbetween 1768 and 1999 exceeded the average annual mean\nhigh water by 1.3\u20132.6 m. These extreme high waters occur\non spring tides, with the largest high water occurring in\n1905 [Woodworth and Blackman, 2002]. To investigate the\nimportance of the tide, we compare the magnitude of the\npeak tide\u2010surge residual to peak filtered surge residual for\nthe five largest tide\u2010surge residuals and five largest filtered\nsurge residuals at Liverpool. The tidal and surge residual\nconditions are also analyzed to determine what caused\nthe largest high water levels at Liverpool over the past\n11 years.\n4.1. Tide\u2010Surge Interaction\n[16] Tide\u2010surge interaction is significant at Liverpool\n[Brown et al., 2010b]. We look at the five most extreme\ntide\u2010surge residuals (Table 3) and the 5 most extreme fil-\ntered surge residuals (Table 4) to determine how the tidal\nrange modifies the magnitude of the peak in filtered surge\n(meteorological surge) to create the peak in tide\u2010surge\nFigure 3. Storm tracks generating the five largest surge events at Heysham. The track number relating it\nto a surge event is given in Table 1. The storm position is plotted every hour, and the locations at peak\nsurge are marked by open circles.\nBROWN ET AL.: A DECADAL\u2010SCALE INVESTIGATION OF STORMS C05018C05018\n6 of 12\nresidual (overall surge). It is very infrequent that a storm\nevent is classed as an extreme event by both surge defi-\nnitions simultaneously.\n[17] We find that the most extreme tide\u2010surge residuals\n(Table 3) occur during low water levels (>1 m). Also the\ntidal range at the time of these surges implies that they occur\nduring tides between neap (5 m) and mean (7.5 m) tidal\nranges. The largest filtered surge residuals (Table 4) can\noccur at any water level, but only result in a significant tide\u2010\nsurge residual if the water level is low when it peaks (e.g.,\n26 December 1998). In all cases shown, the magnitude of\nthe filtered surge residual (due to the wind) is enhanced\ndue to tide\u2010surge interaction. But it is possible for the\nsurge to be reduced if it occurs close to spring high water\nlevels (an example is discussed by Brown et al. [2010b]).\nFlood inundation in Liverpool Bay is therefore unlikely to\nresult solely from an extreme surge event, but rather as a\nresult of a smaller surge during (spring) tidal HW. On the\nrare occasion that a significant surge does occur on\nthe falling tide, the surge can significantly contribute to\nthe HW level leading to extreme flooding, e.g., 26 Sep-\ntember 1905 and 11\u201312 November 1977 [Woodworth and\nBlackman, 2002].\n[18] The skew surge is used to determine the flood risk at\neach location investigated. This value represents the addi-\ntional water level on top of the predicted tidal high water [de\nVries et al., 1995]. Over the 11 year study period the\nmaximum skew surge at both locations occurred on the\n8 January 2005. At Liverpool it reached 1.80 m and for\nHeysham it reached 1.64 m. For this event the tide\u2010surge\nresidual was actually larger at Heysham (Table 1). So,\nalthough Heysham experiences the largest surges, the tide\u2010\nsurge interaction at this location can sometimes result in a\nlower skew surge than the coincidental skew surge at\nLiverpool, owing to the larger tidal range. The skew surge\nat Liverpool was 0.5 m or greater on 370 occasions in\n11 years and was 1.0 m or greater 17 times in 11 years. At\nHeysham the skew surge was equal to or greater than 0.5 m\nand 1.0 m 470 times and 20 times, respectively. Since 1996\nthere seems to be a slowly increasing trend in the positive\nskew surge at both Liverpool (Figure 6, line 1) and Heysham\n(Figure 7, line 1). However, the trend in the extreme skew\nsurge (\u22650.6 m) is decreasing at both locations (line 2 in\nFigure 4. Same as Figure 3, but for Liverpool.\nBROWN ET AL.: A DECADAL\u2010SCALE INVESTIGATION OF STORMS C05018C05018\n7 of 12\nFigures 6 and 7). This implies that the future flood risk could\nincrease in frequency along the Sefton coastline but not in\nintensity. The rate of increase in the positive skew surge is\ngreater for Heysham (\u223c12 mm\/yr) than Liverpool (\u223c9 mm\/\nyr). Compared with the overall variability in the data (0 to\n\u223c1.7 m) and the variability in the extreme values (\u223c1.1 to\n\u223c1.7 m) over the 11 year period these trends have low\nsignificance.\n4.2. Extreme High Water\n[19] Over the past decade the most extreme high\u2010water\nlevel reached 5.64 m at Liverpool on the 10 February 1997,\nFigure 5. Storm tracks generating the five largest wave conditions in Liverpool Bay. The track number\nrelating it to a wave event is given in Table 2. The storm position is plotted every hour, and the locations\nat the peak of the wave event are marked by open circles.\nTable 3.

This event\nwas the result of west\u2013southwesterly winds (257.60\u00b0) with a\nmaximum speed of 20.4 m\/s. The filtered surge residual\nshows that the peak in the wind\u2010driven surge occurred close\nto high water (Figure 8b). Spring tide\u2010surge interaction\nprevented a significant tide\u2010surge residual at this time\n(\u223c0.6 m). The peak in the tide\u2010surge residual followed during\nthe lower water levels and reached 1.34 m, although large\nthis is not considered to be an extreme surge. The tide\u2010surge\ninteraction enhanced the peak (filtered) surge by a factor of\n1.77 as the water levels fell (i.e., the ratio of the peak tide\u2010\nsurge to peak filtered surge was 1.77). But the tide\u2010surge\nresidual was initially reduced during high water.\n[20] At Heysham the highest water level achieved was\n6.18 m on 1 February 2002, as a result of 22.0 m\/s south\u2013\nsouthwesterly winds (195.13\u00b0) (Figure 9). The tidal range\nwas 10.49 m. Interestingly, the peak in the tide\u2010surge re-\nsidual nearly coincides with the time of the peak in the\nFigure 6.

The\nhigh water levels prevent a significant peak in the tide\u2010surge\nresidual (\u223c1.28 m). In this case the peak (filtered) surge was\nenhanced by a (multiplication) factor of 1.43 due to tide\u2010\nsurge interaction giving the overall (tide\u2010surge) residual.\nAlthough the filtered surge is of a similar magnitude to that\nin the Liverpool case, the modulation of the tide\u2010surge re-\nsidual is noticeably less than in the Liverpool case. This may\nbe the result of slightly weaker wind\u2010forcing at low water\nand\/or the more southerly wind direction reducing the local\nsurge contribution. The timing of the peak winds compared\nwith the time of high water limited the tide\u2010surge interaction\npreventing a significant enhancement in the tide\u2010surge re-\nsidual. Unlike the largest high water case at Liverpool, the\ntidal modulation of the surge is less significant.\n[21] Neither of these events was associated with a sig-\nnificant tide\u2010surge residual (i.e., <1.5 m) or filtered surge\nresidual (i.e., <1 m). But the large tidal range combined with\nsignificant winds from the southwest can enhance high\nwater levels leading to flood risk.\n5. Discussion\n[22] In the eastern Irish Sea extreme wave heights (>4 m)\nrarely coincide with the most extreme surge events (>1.5 m).\nWest to northwesterly wind conditions leading to extreme\nwave conditions will generate surge events but not to ex-\ntreme levels (i.e., <1.5 m). It is only under west\u2013southwest\nand westerly wind conditions that extreme surge levels and\nwave heights can be generated simultaneously. When the\nwind veers from the southwest to the west, the largest waves\nand largest surge can coincide. Extreme west\u2013southwesterly\nwind conditions therefore cause the worst flood risk along\nthe Sefton coastline as a result of extreme surge levels (2\u2013\n2.5 m) and large wave overtopping conditions (\u223c5.6 m).\n[23] Tide\u2010surge interaction modulates the extent of the\nsurge and the likelihood of coastal flooding in Liverpool\nBay. We have found that the largest filtered surge residuals\n(i.e., the surge due to the wind alone) do not cause the\nlargest tide\u2010surge residual (i.e., due to the interaction of\nthe tide and the wind driven surge). The tidal elevation at the\ntime of the surge can either enhance or reduce the size of the\nresulting surge level (Figure 8b). The tide\u2010surge residual\ngives an idea of the magnitude of the additional water level\non top of the predicted tidal level. Hence, this is more im-\nportant in a region of large tidal range, e.g., Liverpool Bay,\nwhen assessing flood risk. Often an extreme tide\u2010surge re-\nsidual peak will occur during low water levels in Liverpool\nBay; hence the flood risk posed is minimal as the overall\nwater level is still below that of spring high tide. Extreme\ntide\u2010surge residual peaks and extreme filtered surge residual\npeaks very rarely coincide (Tables 3 and 4). A storm event\nclassed as extreme by one residual classification may not\nbe considered extreme by the other. The residual used to\ndetermine extreme events in regions of large tidal range\nmust therefore be chosen carefully.\n[24] The most extreme tide\u2010surge residuals occur during\ntides with a range between neap and mean tides. Although\nthe wind stress has most influence on the water column\nduring spring low water, the duration and fetch of the wind\nalso controls the size of the surge. Higher water elevations,\nabove mean tidal level, during spring tide act to reduce the\neffect of the wind generating the local surge. This seems to\nhave more of an effect than the lower water levels allowing\nthe surge to be enhanced. Although smaller surges seem to\noccur during spring tides, the most extreme high water le-\nvels are still achieved during spring tides since the tide effect\nis dominant.\n[25] Waves are locally generated in Liverpool Bay\n[Brown and Wolf, 2009]. Winds from the northwest and\nwest have the longest fetches, thus generate the most severe\nwave conditions. If winds from these directions become\nmore intense and frequent, so will the extreme wave con-\nditions. Since the waves are locally generated the speed of\nthe storm has little effect on the resultant wave conditions.\nThe most severe surge conditions occurred when the winds\nwere from the southwest. Since the external surge has a\ndominant contribution to the surge in the eastern Irish Sea\nthis direction provides longest fetch for surge generation. A\nfast\u2010moving storm can continue to act on the external surge\nas both surge and storm propagate along the fetches to\nLiverpool Bay enhancing the (total) surge conditions, while\nFigure 8.

The coast is at most risk from flooding when a\nsouthwesterly wind veers to the west during HW spring tide.\nUnder these conditions substantial wave heights coincide\nwith a low to moderate surge on top of extreme tidal levels.\nThis leads to a high risk of defenses being overtopped and\nextreme dune erosion (e.g., November 1977) [Jones and\nDavies, 1998; Pye and Neal, 1994].\n[26] The worst flood risk in Liverpool Bay, due to water\nlevels alone, will be posed when strong southwesterly winds\ncoincide with maximum spring high tide. During these\nconditions flooding could be worse if waves are present. In\ncontrast, at times of highest water elevation the actual tide\u2010\nsurge residual is not classed as extreme due to the consid-\nerable water depth at the time of the peak in wind effect. A\nlarge tide\u2010surge residual may occur during times of lower\ntidal levels, but will not pose a flood risk as a consequence\nof the much lower tidal levels at this time. Flood risk\nposed by wave overtopping is greatest during westerly or\nnorthwesterly wind conditions, especially if combined with\nmaximum tidal water levels. The effect of wave setup will\nbe assessed in further research using a higher resolution\n(185 m) model of Liverpool Bay.\n[27] No long\u2010term change in the level by which the\naverage annual mean HW is exceeded by extreme high water\nlevels is expected [Woodworth and Blackman, 2002].\nHowever, an increase in future extreme water levels around\nthe United Kingdom is expected due to sea level rise and an\nincrease in wave height, up to 5% of present\u2010day conditions\nby 2075 is projected around the United Kingdom by\nSutherland and Wolf [2002], due to climate change. If\ncoastal defenses remain unchanged then overtopping of\nseawalls could increase by 150%. This increased flood risk\nis mainly posed by sea level rise [Sutherland and Wolf,\n2002]. At Liverpool the present rate of sea level rise is\n1.4 mm\/yr [Woodworth et al., 1999]. Thus the change in\nwater depth over the next decade will be small compared\nwith the tidal range in the eastern Irish Sea. The major threat\nto Liverpool Bay will be an increase in the frequency and\nintensity of west\u2013southwesterly wind events. These condi-\ntions generate the most extreme locally generated surge and\nwave events in response to storms. More rapid change in the\nmorphology of the (Sefton) coastline could also result as a\nconsequence of the increased frequency of extreme events.\nA change in the northeasterly storm tracks such that the\nmaximum southwest winds cross over the eastern Irish Sea\nwould also increase the flood risk within Liverpool Bay,\nwhereas a shift further north would reduce the flood risk in\nLiverpool Bay.\n6. Conclusions\n[28] Using the presented methodology applied to model\nhindcast and observational data for the last 11 years (1996\u2013\n2006, inclusive) we have found that the largest surge in the\neastern Irish Sea during that period was 2.43 m and the\nlargest significant wave height was 5.6 m. Extreme surge\nconditions in the eastern Irish Sea are generated by south-\nwesterly to westerly winds. Extreme wave conditions are\ngenerated by westerly to northwesterly winds. The most\nextreme wave and surge conditions occur (simultaneously)\nwhen a southwesterly wind with significant strength (\u226520m\/s)\nveers to the west. This often occurs when a storm tracks\nacross or just north of the eastern Irish Sea and into the\nNorth Sea in a northeast direction. The peaks of the surge or\nwaves occur at different times during the storm propagation,\nbut both peaks occur between 6\u201312 h into the storm track.\n[29] When strong southwesterly winds occur close to\nspring high tide in Liverpool Bay the most extreme water\nlevels result. When combined with the presence of waves,\novertopping of coastal defenses along the Sefton coastline\ncould lead to coastal flooding. Future flood risk will there-\nfore increase with sea level rise and if more intense south-\nwesterly wind conditions occur. Under these conditions the\nadditional water level on top of spring high tide may be\nless than a meter, but the very high tidal range contributes\nsignificantly.\n[30] The track of the storm determines the wind sequence\nexperienced in the eastern Irish Sea. Storms traveling\nnortheast passing to the north of Liverpool Bay cause the\nworst surge conditions in the bay. Often large waves are\nassociated with these storm tracks. Storms moving southeast\noff the east coast of Britain or moving east just north of\nScotland can generate significant waves within Liverpool\nBay, with no simultaneous large surge event. From the re-\nsults presented we can conclude that southwesterly wind\nconditions veering west pose the greatest flood risk as they\ngenerate the largest tide\u2010surge residual and extreme wave\nconditions on top of the raised water levels.\n[31] Acknowledgments.
