It provides the \nimmediate context for this article which seeks to present a pragmatic liberal \nhumanist critique of pornography regulation. It is argued that such a critique, \nderived in particular from the writings of Martha Nussbaum and Richard \nRorty, presents an alternative case for regulation, one which eschews the \nvisceral competing fundamentalisms which characterised the \u201eporn-wars\u201f of \nthe 1980s and 1990s. Whilst moral and epistemological philosophers squabble \nwith radical feminists and radical libertarians, extreme pornography can \nnurture real injustice and ruin real lives. A pragmatic liberal humanism \ndemands a pragmatic response to extreme pornography. The first part of this \narticle will revisit the longer history of the \u201eporn-wars\u201f and the \nfundamentalisms which characterised so much of the attendant debate. The \nsecond will then describe the parameters of a pragmatic liberal humanist \ncritique, before examining, in the third part, the shorter history of pornography \nregulation which is written into the provisions now enacted in the 2008 Act. \n \n \n \nThe debate regarding the legal regulation of pornography has waxed and waned: \nburning fiercely for much of the 1980s, all but eclipsed for parts of the 1990s.\n1\n Today, \nthis debate is beginning to sharpen once again, given an immediate impetus by the \nenactment of new provisions in the 2008 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act \ndesigned to criminalize the possession of images of \u201eextreme pornography\u201f. Such \nregulation, as we shall see, is the subject of considerable vexation, one where the \nintellectual mist rapidly reddens. Of course, few claim that pornographic imagery \nshould remain beyond any regulation. There is a line in the sand, a point at which the \nvast majority agree that something must be done; images of child abuse can be found \nat such a point. And once that line is drawn, then the question no longer becomes that \nof whether we should regulate, but simply what should be regulated, how it might be \nbest regulated, and how such regulation might be most convincingly justified. The \npurpose of this article is to address, in particular, this latter question. In doing so, it \nwill present a distinctive liberal humanist defence of pornography regulation, one \nwhich draws on the particular writings of Martha Nussbaum and Richard Rorty.  \n \n \n                                                 \n*\n  Durham Law School, Durham University.  \n**\n  Newcastle Law School, Newcastle University.  \nWe should like to thank Erika Rackley for her insightful discussions on many of the issues raised in \nthis article and the anonymous referees for their helpful comments on an earlier draft \n \n1\n  For an expression of this sense of weariness, see Alisa Carse, \u201ePornography: an uncivil \nliberty?\u201f (1995) 10 Hypatia 155. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 2 \n1. Pornography: The Clash of Fundamentalisms \n \nA liberal humanist perspective is presented as an alternative to the existing debate \ninherited from the so-called \u201eporn-wars\u201f of the 1980s and early 1990s.2 For reasons of \nbetter comprehension, this debate can be triangulated: a clash of three competing \nfundamentalisms, the moral conservative, the radical feminist, and the classical \nliberal.\n3\n We must revisit each in turn, before outlining a liberal humanist approach. \n \nA. Moral Fundamentalism \n \nThe first fundamentalism, what Joel Feinberg termed \u201emoralistic paternalism\u201f, has \ntended to proclaim deep historical roots.\n4\n In the popular perception, it is often \nassociated with Victorian \u201evalues\u201f; even though, as Lisa Sigel has recently confirmed, \npornographic imagery was just as commonly found in the mid-nineteenth century \ngentleman\u201fs drawing room as it is today.5 More often than not moral fundamentalism \nalso imports a theological charge. Notably, many of the more strident contributions to \nthe consultation process which accompanied the drafting of the extreme pornography \nprovisions in the 2008 Act came from Christian interest groups. The Lawyers\u201f \nChristian Fellowship, for example, suggested that \u201eall forms of pornographic material\u201f \nwere a \u201eserious problem\u201f because it \u201eencourages a distorted and selfish view of \nsexuality\u201f which \u201edivorces sex from love and tenderness\u201f.6 Familiar jurisprudential \nexpressions of this theologically-grounded moralism can be found in texts such as \nPatrick Devlin\u201fs commentary on the 1957 Wolfenden Report, The Enforcement of \nMorals.\n7\n According to Devlin, English law was \u201einextricably joined\u201f to questions of \nmorality and faith, so much so that \u201ewithout the help of Christian teaching the law will \nfail\u201f. The purpose of criminal law is to address the ravages of \u201esin\u201f, and in so doing \nmaintain the authority of the \u201eright-minded man\u201f. Respect for \u201ecommon morality\u201f, in \nsum, is the \u201eprice\u201f paid by a civilized society.8 And sexual promiscuity, however it is \ndisplayed, represents a particular threat to such a society.\n9\n There was nothing shy \nabout Devlin\u201fs invocation of what he perceived to be a distinctively English \u201elegal \nmoralism\u201f, as Herbert Hart described it.10 \n \n                                                 \n2\n  For an earlier plea to move beyond the \u201estark dichotomous choice\u201f which the porn-wars \npresented, see Emily Jackson, \u201eThe Problem with Pornography: A Critical Survey of the Current \nDebate\u201f (1995) 3 Feminist Legal Studies 49. \n3\n  The same essential triangulation was noted by Jackson, above n 2, at 51-2. For the supposition \nthat there is here a clash of \u201efundamental\u201f political and jurisprudential principles, see Ishani Maitra and \nMary Kate McGowan, \u201eThe Limits of Free Speech: Pornography and the Question of Coverage\u201f (2007) \n13 Legal Theory 42. \n4\n  Joel Feinberg, \u201ePornography and the Criminal Law\u201f, in David Copp and Susan Wendell (eds) \nPornography and Censorship (New York: Prometheus, 1983), 133. \n5\n  See Lisa Sigel, Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England 1815-\n1914, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2002) 1-13 and also Mary McIntosh, \u201eLiberalism \nand the contradictions of Sexual Politics\u201f, in Lynne Segal and Mary McIntosh (eds) Sex Exposed: \nSexuality and the Pornography Debate (London: Virago, 1992) 165. \n6\n  Quoted in Clare McGlynn and Erika Rackley, \u201eStriking a Balance: Arguments for the \nCriminal Regulation of Extreme Pornography\u201f [2007] Sept Criminal Law Review 677, at 682. \n7\n  Patrick Devlin, The Enforcement of Morals, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1968). \n8\n  Devlin, above n 7, 4-5, 9, 23-5. \n9\n  Devlin, above n 7, 62-3. \n10\n  Herbert Hart, Law, Liberty and Morality (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1968) 4-6. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 3 \nThis morality finds a more immediate juristic expression, of course, in the \nexisting provisions of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act which, until the enactment \nof the 2008 Act, was the primary statutory mechanism for regulating adult \npornography. Section 1 of the 1959 Act defines \u201eobscene\u201f material as that which may \ntend to \u201edeprave or corrupt\u201f the consumer. This specific terminology has a particular \nhistorical resonance, finding an original expression in Lord Cockburn\u201fs proscription \nof material which contained \u201ethoughts of the most impure and libidinous kind\u201f in \nHicklin in 1868.\n11\n A century later, as Susan Edwards has confirmed, English courts \ncontinue, in such cases, to presume that the test of obscenity is set by received \nperceptions of morality and immorality.\n12\n Consumers, as the court confirmed in the \nnotorious Whyte case in 1972, must be protected from themselves.\n13\n \n \nA generation after Devlin, conservative fundamentalism finds a more \nconfident expression amongst communitarian theorists, particularly in the US. Amitai \nEtzioni\u201fs The Spirit of Community was intended to address the \u201eincreasing moral \nconfusion and social anarchy\u201f which had taken possession of fin-de-siecle America.14 \nOther communitarians such as Alasdair MacIntyre shied away from overt moralising. \nEtzioni did not. The future well-being of America, he declared, depended on the \nreassertion of private \u201emorality\u201f and public \u201emoral voice\u201f.15 And like Devlin, Etzioni \nidentified loose sexual morality, including the lax regulation of pornography, as a \npeculiar threat.\n16\n Likewise addressing the particular instance of pornography, a rather \nmore cautious Michael Sandel could still argue that the cause of the \u201ecommon good\u201f \nmight justifiably demand enhanced regulation. There is nothing particularly noble, he \nconfirmed, in a pointed rejoinder to liberal critics, in defending the offensive.\n17\n \n \nIn the UK, the transient advance of \u201ethird way\u201f politics represented a rather \npaler imitation. But if the advocacy of moral fundamentalism was here rather harder \nto discern, at least in academic circles, there was no such reticence amongst \npoliticians, especially those who associated themselves with the crusading zeal of \nBlairite New Labour. In part this zeal was bred of a desire to detach \u201enew\u201f Labour \nfrom the presumed stigma of association which aligned \u201eold\u201f Labour and the \n\u201epermissive society\u201f. In part, too, it could be identified as part of a more personal, and \nintensely theological, mission pursued by the leader of New Labour, Prime Minister \nBlair.\n18\n \n \nSuch moralism was apparent in government briefings which attended the \npassage of the 2008 Act. One Home Office minister simply declaimed images of \nextreme pornography to be \u201eextremely offensive to the vast majority of people\u201f.19 In \n                                                 \n11\n  R v Hicklin (1868) LR 3 QB 360, at 371.  \n12\n  See Susan Edwards, \u201eOn the Contemporary Application of the Obscene Publications Act \n1959\u201f [1998] Criminal Law Review 849. \n13\n  Whyte v DPP [1972] AC 849. \n14\n  Amitai Etzioni, The Spirit of Community: Rights, Responsibilities and the Communitarian \nAgenda, (London: Fontana, 1995). \n15\n  Etzioni, above n 14, ix-xi, 12. \n16\n  Etzioni, above n 14, 198-9. \n17\n  Michael Sandel, \u201eMorality and the Liberal Ideal\u201f (1984) 190 New Republic May 15-17. \n18\n  See generally Julian Petley, \u201eNew Labour, Old Morality\u201f, Index on Censorhip 02 2007, 132-6. \n19\n  Paul Goggins, quoted in Home Office Press Release, \u201eCrackdown on Violent Pornography\u201f, \n31 August 2005, available at: http:\/\/press.homeoffice.gov.uk\/press-\nreleases\/Crackdown_On_Violent_Pornography?version=1 [last visited 18 February 2009]. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 4 \nits response to the 2005 consultation paper, the Conservative Party likewise \ndenounced the portrayal of sexual activity that was \u201edepraved and corrupting\u201f.20 The \nsame tone could be clearly heard in parliamentary debate. Justice Secretary Jack \nStraw expressed himself repelled by such \u201evile\u201f imagery. Martin Salter MP railed \nagainst images that were \u201eobscene and disturbing\u201f, adding \u201eIf people want to do weird \nthings to each other, they still can, but I say \u201cdon\u201ft put it on the internet\u201d\u201f. Charles \nWalker MP weighed in with a personal dislike of \u201enasty and unpleasant stuff\u201f.21 \nParliament is, of course, the last place to look for nuanced intellectual debate. But the \nsentiment, all the same, was clearly audible. It was altogether more conservative than \nliberal, and in its invariable desire to promote particular norms of non-corrupting \nsexual behaviour, presumed a moral charge.  \n \nOf course, one critical feature of these utterances is immediately notable: their \nlack of precision. What is pornographic and what is not? The question is one which \nexercises anyone who engages with the subject, including, as we shall see, anti-\npornography feminists.\n22\n But this critical indeterminacy tends to haunt moral \nfundamentalists all the more. Liberals argue against regulation, in part, because \npornography cannot be defined, at least not absolutely. Richard Posner, a rather \ndifferent liberal it must be admitted, makes precisely this argument.\n23\n On its face the \nargument has some strength. Should we seek to criminalise people who enjoy \nsomething we cannot even define? Justice Stevens\u201fs observations in the Jacobellis \ncase are notorious. Declining to attempt a definition, because he \u201ecould never succeed \nin intelligibly doing so\u201f, Stevens nevertheless concluded \u201eI know it when I see it\u201f.24 \nPractical perhaps; but not on its face terribly helpful, especially to a moral \nfundamentalist. It hardly helps the cause of proscription if no one can define for sure \nwhat it is they hope to proscribe. Ultimately, it is this indelible contingency, political, \nsocial and cultural, as well as textual, which fatally undermines the grander \nintellectual pretensions of moral fundamentalism.  \n \nB. Feminist Fundamentalism \n \nThe uncompromising tone of moral fundamentalism finds a resonance in the \ncompeting claims made by radical anti-pornography feminists. Andrea Dworkin \narticulated a famously categorical tone, suggesting that all pornography confirms that \n\u201emale pleasure is inextricably tied to victimizing, hurting, exploiting; that sexual fun \nand passion in the privacy of the male imagination are inseparable from the brutality \nof male history\u201f.25 Catharine MacKinnon agreed: pornography is a totem of endemic \n\u201efemale sexual slavery\u201f.26 The potential reach of regulation imputed by this \nfundamentalism found an equally famous expression in the anti-pornography \nOrdinances crafted by Dworkin and MacKinnon.\n27\n The Ordinances intended to create \n                                                 \n20\n  Quoted in McGlynn and Rackley, above n 6, at 682. \n21\n  See variously, Hansard, 8\/10\/2007, cols.60, 92-3, 113, 117. \n22\n  See Jackson, above n 2, at 49, noting that a \u201eprecise definition is difficult, perhaps even \nimpossible\u201f. \n23\n  See his Sex and Reason (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1994) 381-2. \n24\n  Jacobellis v Ohio (1964) 378 US, 197. \n25\n  Andrea Dworkin, Pornography: men possessing women (London: Women\u201fs Press, 1981) 224. \n26\n  Catharine MacKinnon, Women\u2019s Lives: men\u2019s laws (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University \nPress, 2005) 301. \n27\n  The Ordinance text can be found in MacKinnon, above n 26, at 493-7, with further details at \n359-72.

Whilst \nthe Supreme Court eventually affirmed their unconstitutionality in Hudnut, as being \ncontrary to the First Amendment, the strategic value of the proposed Ordinances was \nconsiderable; bringing to the fore of public debate the potential, intensely gendered, \nharms which pornographic images might promote.\n28\n \n \nThe evolution of feminist fundamentalism has a dual aspect; one associated \nwith the vexed issue of causal harm, the other with conceptual notions of objectivity. \nIn the case of the former, it is argued that pornographic images, especially those \nwhich portray sexualised violence, inspire men to commit acts of sexual assault. The \nMinneapolis hearings, which prefaced the Dworkin-MacKinnon Ordinance, heard \nmuch testimony which confirmed the possibility of a causal link between \npornography and sexual violence. For the \u201efirst time in history\u201f, MacKinnon insisted, \nwomen, more particularly those trapped in the sex industry, \u201espoke to the harms done \nto them through pornography\u201f. For those who had somehow \u201esurvived pornography, \nthe hearings were like coming up for air\u201f. Central to MacKinnon\u201fs thesis is the \nasserted link between pornography and rape; \u201eporn is the theory, rape is the \npractice\u201f.29 The supposition clearly presumes a causal association, and finds support \nelsewhere. It was imputed in the conclusions to the Meese Commission, and has been \nmore recently affirmed in a 2007 Home Office report on the subject which found \n\u201eevidence of some harmful effects from extreme pornography on some who access \nit\u201f.30  \n \nHowever, the problem with the causation argument is that it remains difficult \nto prove; or at least easy for the liberal fundamentalist to reject.\n31\n The evidence might, \n                                                                                                                                            \nhttp:\/\/www.nostatusquo.com\/ACLU\/dworkin\/other\/ordinance\/newday\/AppA.htm [last visited 17 \nFebruary 2009]. \n28\n  The Supreme Court agreeing that they breached the First Amendment.

It also spread across the \nborder into Canada, exercising a notable influence on the crafting of Canadian obscenity legislation. \nSee further Bret Boyce, \u201eObscenity and Community Standards\u201f (2008) 33 Yale Journal of International \nLaw 299. In addition, the legacy of the MacKinnon\/Dworkin approach to pornography can be seen in \nmany of the feminist responses to the Government\u201fs 2005 consultation on extreme pornography, as \ndiscussed in McGlynn and Rackey, above n 6 at 681-682 and further below. \n29\n  Catharine MacKinnon , \u201eThe Roar on the Other Side of Silence\u201f, in Catharine MacKinnon and \nAndrea Dworkin (eds) In Harm\u2019s Way: The Pornography-Civil Rights Hearings (Cambridge, Mass: \nHarvard University Press, 1997) 17. \n30\n  See, respectively, Attorney General\u201fs Commission on Pornography (Meese Commission) \n(1986), available at: http:\/\/www.porn-report.com\/ and Catherine Itzin, Anne Taket and Liz Kelly, The \nEvidence of Harm to Adults Relating to Exposure to Extreme Pornographic Material: a rapid evidence \nassessment, (Ministry of Justice Research Series 10-07, 2007), at \nhttp:\/\/www.justice.gov.uk\/docs\/280907.pdf [both last visited 17 February 2009].

The authors concluded that \ntheir research represented a \u201esignificant step in clarifying the position in an area subject to previous \nacademic dispute about the findings of specific studies\u201f (at v).  \n31\n  See, for example, James Weinstein, Hate Speech, Pornography and the Radical Attack on \nFree Speech Doctrine (Boulder: Westview Press, 1999) 132, asserting that data might incline towards a \npossible link, but as yet \u201eno confident conclusions can be drawn\u201f. Posner also uses the same argument \nin his Sex and Reason, above n 23, at 370-1. An early and authoritative critique of the possibility of a \nsufficient causal link can be found in Joel Feinberg, above n 4, at 105-37. The broader jurisprudential \ndebate regarding the possibilities of establishing causal harm in criminal law is vast. For recent \nexpressions, see Andrew von Hirsch, \u201eExtending the Harm Principle: Remote Harms and Fair \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 6 \nat best, be \u201esuggestive\u201f, but it is not \u201ealone dispositive\u201f.32 For this reason, many \nfeminists reject reliance on causation arguments. Karen Boyle, for example, argues \nthat linking a feminist case against pornography to \u201eflawed effects research\u201f has \n\u201esignificantly damaged\u201f the feminist anti-pornography argument.33 Drucilla Cornell \nsimilarly questions the strategic value of alleging causal linkage. The impact of \npornography, she observes, is anyway likely to be various, any harm as readily \nallusive as immediate.\n34\n For this reason, Robyn Eckersley advocates a \nreconceptualisation of the harm of pornography, conceiving of it as a \u201esignifying \npractice\u201f which shares \u201emany characteristics with other more everyday representations \nof women\u201f.35 Such an approach, marrying textual sophistication with a more \npragmatic concern with the varieties of women\u201fs experiences, reaches towards the \nkind of liberal humanism which we will advance shortly. \n \nThe second aspect of this radical feminist argument centres on \n\u201eobjectification\u201f and the constitutive capacity of pornography. Here pornography is an \nact, rather than mere speech; a series of \u201einstitutions and practices\u201f which \u201econstitute\u201f \nrather than simply express \u201ethe ideas they embody\u201f.36 The claim is that pornography \nenshrines a particular, degraded image of women; it defines them in a peculiarly \nsexualised way, and in doing so denies their humanity. Rae Langton makes this \nargument\n37\n, though it finds original expression in MacKinnon, most strikingly in Only \nWords: \u201ePornography is not restricted here because of what it says. It is restricted \nbecause of what it does\u201f. 38 The harm is immediate, quite literally apparent, and in no \nneed of anecdotal or other reinforcement. It is part of what critical legal scholars, \nechoing early twentieth century phenomenologists, term the \u201elived experience\u201f of \nbeing female.\n39\n Such an imposition, the construction of a particular image of women \nby pornography, it has been further argued, can itself be construed as an infringement \nof an alternative right to equality.\n40\n For obvious reasons, the resonance between the \nthesis presented in Only Words and the \u201espeech act\u201f theories of Austin and Searle has \n                                                                                                                                            \nImputation\u201f, in Andrew Simester and ATH Smith (eds) Harm and Culpability (Oxford: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 1996) 259-76; Andrew Simester and Andrew von Hirsch, \u201eRethinking the Offence \nPrinciple\u201f (2002) 8 Legal Theory 269 and Dennis Baker, \u201eThe Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote \nHarms\u201f (2007) 10 New Criminal Law Review 370. \n32\n  Cass Sunstein, \u201ePornography and the First Amendment\u201f (1986) Duke Law Journal 589, at \n600. \n33\n  Karen Boyle, \u201eThe Pornography Debates: beyond cause and effect\u201f (2000) 23 Women\u2019s \nStudies International Forum 187, at 187. \n34\n  Drucilla Cornell, The Imaginary Domain (London: Routledge, 1995) 101. \n35\n  Robin Eckersley, \u201eWhither the Feminist Campaign: an evaluation of feminist critiques of \npornography\u201f (1987) 15 International Journal of the Sociology of Law 164. \n36\n  Catharine MacKinnon, Only Words (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 1993) 11-13. \nFor an overview of the broader argument, see Cynthia Stark, \u201eIs Pornography an Action?

Conservatives, as Robin West noted, worry about God, virtue and \nmaintaining the status quo; anti-pornography feminists about women being raped.\n44\n \nViolence is the key differential. For this reason, David Dyzenhaus suggests that \nfeminists opposing the proliferation of pornography would find better \u201eallies\u201f in those \nliberals who argue  for a \u201erich\u201f conception of harm and equality.45 \n \nIn the longer term, other feminists, in response to the fundamentalism of the \nradical anti-pornography approach, began to articulate a more nuanced approach to \npornography. Robin West eloquently suggested that women\u201fs experiences of \npornography are variable; much of it is regressive and degrading, but some may be \npositive, even \u201elife-affirming\u201f.46 Less inclined to embrace nuance was Wendy \nMcElroy. Pornography, McElroy baldly affirmed, \u201ebenefits women, both personally \nand politically\u201f.47 While this declaration has tendencies towards fundamentalism of its \nown, it highlights the divergence in feminist approaches to the regulation and \nconsumption of pornography. For this reason, the instantiation of a feminist position \nagainst pornography, a feminist fundamentalism indeed, must be resisted.\n48\n   \n \nC. Liberal Fundamentalism \n \nA third fundamentalism, ranged against both conservative and feminist alike, is rooted \nin classical liberal jurisprudence. Once again, it could be heard, albeit in often rather \n                                                 \n41\n  John L. Austin, How to do Things with Words, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975) and John \nSearle, Rediscovery of the Mind (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1992). \n42\n  For a critical view, see Jennifer Saul, \u201ePornography, Speech Acts and Context\u201f (2006) 106 \nProceedings of the Aristotelian Society 227, at 229-48, concluding that a \u201espeech act\u201f as understood by \nan Austinian only makes sense in particular contexts, and cannot be strategically deployed to bolster a \nmore general, necessarily more abstract, argument. The \u201ebest one can do\u201f, accordingly, \u201eis to claim that \npornographic viewings are sometimes the subordination of women\u201f. Similarly sceptical is Mary Kate \nMcGowan, above n 38, 43-6. \n43\n  Martha Nussbaum, Cultivating Humanity: a classical defense of reform in liberal education  \n(Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1997) 141. \n44\n  Robin West, \u201eThe Feminist-Conservative Anti-Pornography Alliance and the 1986 Attorney-\nGeneral\u201fs Commission on Pornography Report\u201f (1987) 12 American Bar Foundation Research Journal  \n681, at 700-7. \n45\n  David Dyzenhaus, \u201eJohn Stuart Mill and the Harm of Pornography\u201f (1992) 102 Ethics 534, at \n551. \n46\n  Above n 44, at 693 and 709-11.  \n47\n  Wendy McElroy, XXX: a woman\u2019s right to pornography (New York: St Martin\u201fs Press, \n1995), p viii. \n48\n  Drucilla Cornell made the same argument, for a more sensitive appreciation of differential \nexperiences of pornography, in The Imaginary Domain, above n 34, particularly at 95-6 and 162-3. See \nalso Shrage, above n 38. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 8 \ncorrupted form, in the months preceding the 2008 Act; most immediately in arresting \naspersions of pending moral and intellectual despotism.\n49\n There is a rather more sober \nand more rigorous side to liberal fundamentalism of course; one that has enjoyed \nconsiderable intellectual influence over recent decades.\n50\n And it too often proclaims a \nhistorical root, most commonly invoking the canonical writings of John Stuart Mill, \nand latter Millians such as Isaiah Berlin.\n51\n  \n \nThe bit of Mill that liberal fundamentalists like to cite is the so-called \u201eHarm \nPrinciple\u201f. If finds famous expression in Mill\u201fs essay On Liberty: \u201eThat the only \npurpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized \ncommunity, against his will, is to prevent harm to others\u201f.52 The liberal \nfundamentalist prefers a strict interpretation of Mill\u201fs Principle, proclaiming that, in \nthe absence of clear evidence of physical, or perhaps even mental, harm, legislative \nregulation of individual behaviour is unwarranted. In fact, whilst a simplistic \nsequestration of the \u201eHarm Principle\u201f might be deployed against the regulation of \nmilder forms of sexual imagery, it is quite possible that the revered hero of liberal \nfundamentalism would have strode very happily through the government lobbies \nwhen it came to passing legislation criminalizing extreme pornography. A closer \nreading of The Subjection of Women, as David Dyzenhaus has suggested, reveals a \nMill who would have been exercised in the extreme by the supposition that his essay \n\u201eon liberty\u201f should be used to institutionalise the cultural degradation and \njurisprudential inequality of women.\n53\n  \n \nThe current champion of liberal fundamentalism is Ronald Dworkin. In a \nsuccession of essays on the subject, Dworkin has repeatedly argued against the \nprinciple of regulation. This is part of a broader defence of individual liberties against \nthe temptations of intrusive government, cast strategically in terms of a corresponding \nenhancement of individual \u201emoral responsibility\u201f.54 Realising that the increasingly \narcane tenets of moral fundamentalism might be swatted away with relative ease, \nDworkin has focussed instead on the particular challenges of radical feminism.\n55\n To \nthis end he has repeatedly argued two things. First, is the mantra that there is no \n                                                 \n49\n  The Campaign Against Censorship, for example, insinuated that all manner of literary and \ntextual canon might fall victim to the pending legislation, including Leda the Swan and The Rape of \nEuropa: see McGlynn and Rackley, above n 6, at 684-5. Of course, such proscription was never \npossible, and indeed specifically excluded by the requirement for explicit and realistic depictions (see \nfurther below). But, as the pulses race, the temptations to exaggerate can be irresistible. \n50\n  For this influence, see Jackson, above n 2, at 53. \n51\n  For a strong anti-regulation statement, founded on what he terms the \u201eMillian principle\u201f, see \nThomas Scanlon, \u201eA Theory of Freedom of Expression\u201f (1972) 1 Philosophy and Public Affairs 204. \nFor a comment on Mill\u201fs ubiquity in this context, see Susan Easton, The Problem of Pornography: \nregulation and the right to free speech (London: Routledge, 1994) 1-3. \n52\n  John Stuart Mill, On Liberty (London: Penguin, 1985) 68. \n53\n  See David Dyzenhaus, above n 45. Dyzenhaus\u201fs highly original supposition generated \nconsiderable critical comment. For a sceptical rejoinder, see Robert Skipper, \u201eMill and Pornography\u201f \n(1993) 103 Ethics 726. For a more supportive re-iteration, refuting the fundamentalist \u201emyth\u201f of the \nHarm Principle, see Richard Vernon, \u201eJohn Stuart Mill and Pornography: Beyond the Harm Principle\u201f \n(1996) 102 Ethics 621. The same argument is made by Susan Easton, above n 52, at 1-9 and also 52-7. \n54\n  For a crisp statement, see Ronald Dworkin, \u201eThe Coming Battles Over Freedom of Speech\u201f, \nNew York Review of Books 11\/6\/1992, 56-7. \n55\n  See his comments, specifically directed at MacKinnon, in Ronald Dworkin, Freedom\u2019s Law: \nThe Moral Reading of the American Constitution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 227-8. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 9 \ncompelling evidence of causal harm.\n56\n Second, is the collateral argument that, \nregardless of any possible utility, as a matter of policy, regulation of pornography can \nhave a \u201echilling effect\u201f on the broader jurisprudential culture of free expression.57  \n \nFor Dworkin, famously, rights are \u201etrumps\u201f over moral and \u201egoal-based\u201f \narguments; no matter how great or loud the weight of popular opinion in their \nsupport.\n58\n A vague sense of \u201edisgust\u201f, even a strong sense of abhorrence, of the kind \nwhich is more overtly articulated by moral fundamentalists, but which, Dworkin \ninfers, lurks behind the rhetoric of all pro-regulation anti-pornographers, is never \nenough to justify legislative intervention.\n59\n Two such rights are invariably presented; \na right to freedom of expression and a right to privacy. The former, in particular, is \n\u201evaluable\u201f not just \u201ein virtue of the consequences it has\u201f but because it is an \u201eessential \nand constitutive feature of a just political society\u201f.60 The idea that pornography might \ninhibit the free participation of women in such a society is dismissed as \u201einstrumental\u201f \nand derivative, a perversion of Berlin\u201fs idea of \u201epositive liberty\u201f, and its countenance \nin various jurisdictions \u201eominous for liberty and for democracy\u201f, and suggesting of \nincipient \u201etyranny\u201f.61 Of course, the realm of \u201eright\u201f is not conceptually uncontested, \njust as the meaning of \u201espeech\u201f remains a matter of some dispute.62 \n \n \n2. Pragmatism: A Liberal Humanist Critique  \n \n                                                 \n56\n  For a critique of the often rather scanty nature of this dismissal, see Langton, above n 41, at \n327. For the strength of this view, and its hold on academic and popular opinion, see Easton, above n \n52, at 32-3. \n57\n  For an invocation of this effect, see Dworkin, A Matter of Principle (Oxford: Oxford \nUniversity Press, 1985) 348 and also Freedom, above n 55, at 221. The same fear is articulated by \nFeinberg, above n 4, at 112. For a sceptical dismissal of this rather simplistic leap of the juristic \nimagination, see Danny Scoccia, \u201eCan Liberals Support a Ban on Violent Pornography? (1996) 106 \nEthics 776, at 797-8. Deploying a different metaphor, Susan Easton recasts the \u201echilling effect\u201f \nargument as the \u201eslippery slope\u201f argument, see above n 51, at 65-78. \n58\n  See, for example, his comments in Principle, above n 57, particularly at 353-65, written in the \nimmediate context of the Williams\u201f Commission (Bernard Williams, Report of the Committee on \nObscenity and Film Censorship, Cmnd 7772, London: HMSO, 1979) which entertained a variety of \npolicy-based arguments for regulation. As we shall see in due course, in the final analysis, the \nCommission rejected virtually all such argumentation. But Dworkin remained critical of the \nCommission\u201fs willingness even to countenance such arguments in the first place. \n59\n  For an early dismissal of arguments from moral \u201etaste\u201f, see Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights \nSeriously (London: Duckworth, 1977) 257-8. For a re-assertion, see his comments in Freedom, above n \n55, at 233-4 and also 238, concluding that \u201ewe cannot count, among the kinds of interests that may be \nprotected in this way, a right not to be insulted or damaged just by the fact that others have hostile or \nuncongenial tastes, or that they are free to express or indulge them in private\u201f. \n60\n  Dworkin, Freedom, above n 55, at 200-1, citing Mill, once more, as an ultimate authority for \nthis view. \n61\n  Dworkin, Freedom, above n 55, at 205-7, 219-23 and 239. Given his caustic criticism of \nMacKinnon for deploying rhetorical vaguery in the place of cogent argument, Dworkin\u201fs raising the \nspectre of pending \u201etyranny\u201f has its own ironies. For his accusation of \u201ebreathtaking hyperbole\u201f, see \nDworkin\u201fs review of Only Words, republished in Freedom, above n 55, at 230-1. \n62\n  See Langton, \u201eWhose Right?\u201f, above n 40, at 311-12, Sunstein, above n 32, at 625-6 and also \nStark, above n 36, at 277 making this concession. Dworkin also readily concedes the need for \n\u201eexceptions\u201f, but determines to maintain a high-line in permitting such exceptions, and remains \nresolutely opposed, as a matter of principle, to the idea that pornography might be recognised as one. \nFor a discussion of \u201eexceptions\u201f, see Freedom, above n 55, at 209-11. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 10 \nClassical liberalism tends to pervade modern jurisprudence textbooks; think \nliberalism, think autonomy, think rights. It brooks no compromise. Neither, of course, \ndo its rival fundamentalisms, the moral and the radical feminist. But such \nintransigence does few any favours and, for this simple reason, the case for crafting \nalternative approaches is compelling. The purpose of this section is to present such an \nalternative, one which, drawing most immediately on the writings of Martha \nNussbaum and Richard Rorty, can be termed liberal humanist. Such a liberalism, \ndriven primarily by a desire to craft a political morality that is both ethical in its \nconception and pragmatic in its application, will help us to make sense of the \nprovisions recently enacted in the 2008 Act, whilst also perhaps reconciling us to their \nlimitations. This idea of reconciliation, of accepting the virtue of contingency, and \nrelishing it, is central to both aspirations of the liberal humanist; the desire to retrieve \nan ethics and the desire to make it credible. But before we focus more closely on this \nparticular virtue, we must first take a closer look at what a liberal humanist ethics \nmight look like.  \n \nEthics lies at the heart of Nussbaum\u201fs intellectual enterprise; rather more so \nperhaps than Rorty who remained famously sceptical of the lure of \u201ecomprehensive\u201f \ntheories. Nussbaum\u201fs desire to reaffirm a conception of the \u201egood\u201f, as an exercise in \n\u201epractical wisdom\u201f, is overtly Aristotelian.63 We will explore the pragmatic \nimplications of this  conception in due course. Suffice to say, for Nussbaum a \n\u201epractical wisdom\u201f is one that is devoted to particularity, to setting the parameters of \nthe good in relation to the alternative interests of particular individuals. It is for this \nreason that Nussbaum is so anxious that a liberal humanist ethics should be driven by \na concern for the fate of others. An \u201eintelligent\u201f liberal citizenship, as she \nrecommended in Cultivating Humanity: \n \n[M]eans the ability to think what it might be like to be in the shoes of a person different from \noneself, to be an intelligent reader of that person\u201fs story, and to understand the emotions and \nwishes and desires that someone so placed might have.\n64\n \n \nSuch a conception of citizenship imports two other key characteristics. First, it is \nconcerned with feelings, with the faculty of sensibility as much as the faculty of \nreason. Morality and emotion \u201esupport and inform one another\u201f.65 The latter softens \nthe edges of the former, instantiating a critical sense of the particular against the \ntemptations of dogmatic fundamentalism. It is for this reason that a democratic \nsociety needs \u201eleaders\u201f, and it might be added jurists, \u201ewhose hearts and imaginations \nacknowledge the humanity in human beings\u201f.66  \n \nThis same sentiment can be found in Rorty\u201fs description of the liberal \n\u201eironist\u201f, as compared with the metaphysical:  \n \nThe liberal metaphysician wants our wish to be kind to be bolstered by an argument, one \nwhich entails a self-redescription which will highlight a common human essence, an essence \nwhich is something more than our shared ability to suffer humiliation. The liberal ironist just \n                                                 \n63\n  The ambition is strongly, and repeatedly, confirmed in Nussbaum\u201fs, Love\u2019s Knowledge: \nEssays on Philosophy and Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990). For explicit affirmation, \nsee 18, 36-44, 72-3. \n64\n  Nussbaum, Humanity, above n 43, at 10-11. \n65\n  Nussbaum, Love\u2019s Knowledge, above n 63, at 53. \n66\n  Nussbaum, Love\u2019s Knowledge, above n 63, at 101. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 11 \nwants our chances of being kind, of avoiding the humiliation of others, to be expanded by \nredescription. She thinks that recognition of a common susceptibility to humiliation is the only \nsocial bond that is needed.\n67\n \n \nRorty\u201fs rejection of what he termed \u201ecomprehensive\u201f moral philosophy was, of \ncourse, notorious. The idea of a \u201enecessary truth\u201f is merely a \u201eproposition\u201f which \nenjoys a momentary \u201ehold\u201f on our political imagination. There are instead merely \nvarious historically contingent \u201eattempts to solve problems\u201f.68 Rorty\u201fs is an ethics \nwritten \u201ewithout the ought\u201f.69 Of course, such an ethics asks considerable questions of \nliberal jurisprudence. According to Rorty, to say something is right or wrong, just or \nunjust, is merely to say that it does or does not conform to current social practice.\n70\n \nFor this reason, in practical terms the cause of justice would be altogether better \nserved if jurists worried less about abstract rights and rather more about real harm and \nsuffering. Justice is a \u201epractical goal\u201f, not a piece of juristic whimsy, the construct of \nindividuals addressing \u201esmall contingent facts\u201f rather than paying obeisance to \u201elarge \nnecessary truths\u201f.71 The dismissal of rights-theory as a debilitating distraction, the \nprimary theme of his seminal 1993 Amnesty Lecture, attracted a splenetic response \nfrom liberal fundamentalists such as Ronald Dworkin.\n72\n But Rorty was unbowed. The \naspiration of social justice, he later affirmed, will only be realised when \u201etalk of \nfraternity and usefulness has replaced talk of rights\u201f.73 Nussbaum is perhaps a little \nless abrasive, prepared to admit that a theory of rights may have a necessary role in a \nmodern democracy.\n74\n But, like Rorty, she is not prepared to allow a wedded fetish for \nrights and reason to diminish the place of \u201edignity\u201f, or the faculty of compassion, as a \nvital component of a liberal humanist ethics.\n75\n The implications for her more \nconcentrated critique of pornography and legal regulation, to which we shall turn \nshortly, are considerable. \n \nThe second defining quality of a liberal humanist ethics is that it is literate. \nHere Nussbaum and Rorty are in close agreement. In her short essay on the relation of \nliterature and law, Poetic Justice, Nussbaum opened with a defence of the \u201eliterary \nimagination precisely because it seems to me an essential ingredient of an ethical \nstance that asks us to concern ourselves with the good of other people whose lives are \n                                                 \n67\n  Richard Rorty, Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, \n1989) 91.

Pornography can \nobjectify, suggests Nussbaum. It can deny the essential respect for difference which a \nliberal humanist cherishes above all else.\n83\n Deploying a familiar Kantian \nconceptualisation, pornography habitually reduces women to means rather than \u201eends-\nin-themselves\u201f, and the resultant harm, as Nussbaum is quick to affirm, is not merely \ncognitive but deeply emotional too.\n84\n Legal proscription, Nussbaum readily agrees, is \nalways difficult for a liberal jurist. And the prospective proscription of pornography is \nno exception.\n85\n But it is here, at the point of systematic objectification and \ndegradation, that the law must intervene, not as in the past in order to assuage a \nmasculine fear of female sexuality, but because the failure to do so reinforces the \n                                                 \n76\n  Martha Nussbaum, Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life (Boston: Beacon \nPress, 1995), xvi. \n77\n  It is for this reason that Nussbaum discusses Adam Smith\u201fs A Theory of Moral Sentiments in \nsome depth in chapter 14 of Love\u2019s Knowledge, above n 63, arguing, quite rightly, that his \ndetermination to impress the place of emotions in liberal jurisprudence is rooted in the residual \ninfluence of an Aristotelian conception of the good. It is, as Nussbaum stresses, notable that the \nsupposed champion of neo-liberal free market economics should have been so keen to impress the \nvalue of such a philosophy. \n78\n  Nussbaum, Poetic Justice, above n 76, at 119-20. \n79\n  See Rorty, Truth, above n  69, at 172 and also Rorty, Social Hope, above  n 72, at 249, \nechoing the statement made in Contingency, above n 68, at xv. \n80\n  Rorty, Mirror, above n 68, at 370 and 372. \n81\n  Rirchard Rorty, Philosophy as Cultural Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, \n2007) 94, and also 96, 1010-3.

The former prefers a violence of argument against the merits of reason. At 251, \nshe explicitly decries the \u201efire and brimstone\u201f rhetoric which tends to pervade feminist fundamentalism, \nand which maintains \u201eno such space for reconciliation, no positive vision\u201f.

In reality, however, the liberty of some always shapes \nthe subjection of others.\n87\n Fundamentalist conceptions of liberty, as Mill admitted, are \neasily \u201edeformed\u201f.88 Choices have to be proscribed, just as regulatory strategies must \nequally be context-specific. Objectification of the female body may well harm in \ncertain contexts; in others it may not.\n89\n In some instances it may need to be  \nproscribed; as most obviously in the case of child abuse images, or in principle at \nleast, extreme violence. In others it may not. It is for this reason that we can accept \ndepictions of female sexuality in texts such as Lawrence\u201fs Lady Chatterley\u2019s Lover or \nHenry James\u201fs The Golden Bowl, whilst expressing rather greater doubt as we turn the \npages of Playboy or peruse rapedbitch.com.\n90\n Whilst the former, as Nussbaum argues, \ncan be defended in terms of a capacity to liberate an erotic female experience, to \npromote emotional growth perhaps, the latter, which seeks merely to degrade and to \nsilence, cannot.\n91\n In both text and reality, what matters is the \u201eoverall context of the \nhuman relationship\u201f.92 The \u201esalient issue\u201f is the degree of \u201eharm, humiliation and \nsubordination\u201f.93 If the imagery prefers the infliction of violence on the powerless, the \nrelationship is abusive. It seeks to deny the dignity and humanity of the violated, and \nshould be proscribed regardless of notional rights of \u201efree\u201f expression.94 Legal \nregulation is here justified.\n95\n Indeed, in a liberal society which sets itself against the \ncultural defence of such abuse it is demanded.\n96\n  \n \nThe concern with specificity is the third defining characteristic of a liberal \nhumanism. The idea of \u201epractical wisdom\u201f, as we have already noted, is primarily \n                                                 \n86\n  See Easton, above n 51, at 25-7, and also Nussbaum, Sex, above n 74, at 56 and also Hiding \nfrom Humanity: Disgust, Shame and the Law (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2004) 137-9. \n87\n  For arguments along these lines, see Stephen Gardbaum, \u201eWhy the Liberal State can Promote \nMoral Ideas After All\u201f (1991) 104 Harvard Law Review 1350, Shrage, above n 39, especially at 58-64, \nand also, at a slight variance, Leslie Green, \u201ePornographies\u201f (2000) 8 Journal of Political Philosophy \n27. \n88\n  See Nussbaum, Sex, above n 74, at 149. \n89\n  The same view, again based on a reading of Kant, is taken by Shrage, above n 38 at 54, 57-8. \n90\n  For Nussbaum\u201fs particular discussion of Lawrence, James and Playboy, alongside Alan \nHollinghurst\u201fs The Swimming-Pool Library, see Sex, above n 74, chapter 8.

For a critical commentary on Nussbaum\u201fs invocation of \nKantian instrumentality, here, see Green, \u201ePornographies\u201f, above n 87, at 44-5. Green suggests that \nNussbaum is mistaken in assuming that there should always be a prohibition on treating people as \nmeans. \u201eWhat is forbidden\u201f, he argues, is \u201eto treat them merely as means\u201f. This is correct. But it is also \nprecisely what Nussbaum anyway argues, when she denies that instrumentality will always demand \nregulation. \n95\n  In her more recent, Hiding from Humanity, above n 86, at 144-6, Nussbaum explicitly \napproves and recommends the recasting of German criminal law in terms of \u201edignity, subordination and \nobjectification\u201f.  This argument is strongly affirmed by Laurie Shrage, above n 38, at 59-64, for whom \nthe promotion of \u201ereal violence\u201f is the key issue. \n96\n  See her concluding comments, on the moral responsibility to address actions which engender \n\u201erage\u201f against injustice, in Hiding, above n 86, at 139 and again at 146-7. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 14 \ngeared by a desire to address real harms and injustices in a liberal community.\n97\n \nAccording to Nussbaum, therefore, a pragmatic feminist jurisprudence should be \nabove all concerned with ensuring that women have enough to eat, that they can walk \nthe streets in safety, and should not be compelled to suffer the agonies of genital \nmutilation.\n98\n Again, it is for this reason that Nussbaum is so keen to recommend a \npoetic jurisprudence. Literature thrives on human particularity, on \u201ecomplexity\u201f, the \n\u201eflawed and imperfect\u201f.99 It helps reconcile us to chance, \u201eto be bewildered\u201f even, to \n\u201ewait and float and be actively passive\u201f.100 It encourages us to translate our \u201enarrative \nemotions\u201f into our more immediately political or jurisprudential \u201eimagination\u201f.101 It \nalso demands that we embrace a critical contingency in our politics; the appreciation \n \nthat there is after all more joy in the kind of citizenship that questions than in the kind that \nsimply applauds, more fascination in the study of human beings in all their real variety and \ncomplexity than in the zealous pursuit of superficial stereotypes, more genuine love and \nfriendship in the life of questioning and self-government than in submission to authority.\n102\n \n \nSuch an embrace is, of course, just as central to Rorty\u201fs pragmatic politics. As \nhe confirmed in his later Philosophy and Social Hope: \n \n[T]o us pragmatists moral struggle is continuous with the struggle for existence, and no sharp \nbreak divides the unjust from the imprudent, the evil from the inexpedient. What matters for \npragmatists is devising ways of diminishing human suffering and increasing human equality, \nincreasing the ability of all human children to start life with an equal chance of happiness. \nThis goal is not written in the stars, and is no more an expression of what Kant called \u201epure \npractical reason\u201f than it is the will of God. It is a cause worth dying for, but it does not require \nbackup from supernatural forces.\n103\n \n \nTruth, understood as nothing more than a construct of \u201eshared convictions\u201f, is shaped \nonly by the process of \u201econversation\u201f and the \u201econtingencies\u201f of time and context.104 \nRorty repeatedly invoked a Deweyan idea of democratic \u201esolidarity\u201f, a determination \nto give priority to the pragmatics of \u201ehelping people solve problems\u201f, and to broaden \nas far as possible our sense of who might be part of \u201eus\u201f.105  \n \nIn contrast with Nussbaum, Rorty only briefly touched on the issue of \npornography as part of his broader critique of MacKinnon in his 1992 Tanner \nLecture.\n106\n But it is not difficult to flesh out the position of a Rortian pragmatist.

Neither will she fall prey to the juristic miasma of causal harm. \nThe pragmatics of making life better should never be sacrificed on the altar of juristic \nabstraction. It was for this reason that Rorty, whilst wary of its fundamentalist \ntendencies, was so supportive of MacKinnon\u201fs work.107 Urging a critical affinity, \nfounded on their common contempt for \u201erepresentational accounts of knowledge\u201f, \nRorty suggested that ironic pragmatists and radical feminists shared a common \ndetermination to engage real instances of injustice and suffering.\n108\n Approvingly, he \nconcluded:   \n \nWe are not saying that the voice in which women will some day speak will be better at \nrepresenting reality than present-day masculinist discourse\u2026 We are just trying to help \nwomen out of the traps men have constructed for them, help them get the power they presently \ndo not have, and help them create a moral identity for women.\n109\n \n \nThe suggestion that women might \u201eonly now\u201f be in the \u201eprocess of achieving a \nmoral identity as women\u201f did not, of course, speak to some kind of epistemological \ndiscovery.\n110\n Rather, as a result of political strategies designed to generate public \n\u201erevulsion and rage\u201f women are re-writing their historically prescribed social and \nmoral condition.\n111\n Armed with the knowledge that no aspect of this condition is set \nin epistemological stone, those concerned with refining this narrative process should \nfeel empowered to continue their argument against misogyny, degradation and de-\nhumanization, whether or not expressed in pornographic form.\n112\n It is not, moreover, \njust a matter of having the confidence to do so. It is also a matter of having a \nresponsibility to do so.\n113\n The regulation of pornography is subject to the same \u201elaw\u201f \nof history which Hegel uncovered; what one generation thinks is beyond argument, \nthe next generation argues about, and the next generation to come, as often as not, re-\nwrites.\n114\n \n \n3.

It must be admitted that not all feminists were so sanguine \nabout the prospects of history. As Joan Williams observed, such poetic optimism was all very nice. But \nit threatens a distraction not altogether dissimilar from that of the liberal fundamentalist fetish for \nrights.

The \nlatter\u201fs Report on obscenity famously preferred a liberal fundamentalist position, \ndeploying a crude version of Mill\u201fs Harm Principle, and presuming a utilitarian \nrationale for either recommending regulation or not. It concluded that those who \nworried about the impact of pornography on society had got the \u201eproblem\u201f out of \n\u201eproportion\u201f.115 For much of the two decades which followed, anti-pornography \ncampaigns in the UK tended to be piecemeal, often the playthings of individual \nMembers of Parliament or particular media outlets.\n116\n \n \nBut the debate also has a rather shorter history, covering the last four or five \nyears, and one which provides the immediate impetus to revisit, and perhaps \nreconceptualise, the case for pornography regulation. Initiating this shorter history \nwas the popular and political furore which surrounded the murder conviction of \nGraham Coutts and the subsequent enactment of the extreme pornography provisions \nin the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. Coutts, it transpired, was a devotee \nof extreme pornography, indulging his taste excessively in the days and hours before \nhe murdered Jane Longhurst.\n117\n Following his conviction, Jane Longhurst\u201fs mother, \nLiz, campaigned long and hard for reform, gaining in the process not only the \nsignatures of 50,000 supporters, but also the specific approbation of various senior \ngovernment ministers.\n118\n The original Government consultation process, initiated in \n2005, indeed made the link between the Longhurst murder and the Government\u201fs \nproposals explicit.\n119\n  \n \nIn the beginning, the consultation process regarding the new proposals was \nnotable both for its preparedness to countenance statutory prohibition on some forms \nof pornography, as distinct from existing provisions relating to obscenity and \nindecency, and for its justification on the basis of the possible harm of pornographic \nimages of sexual violence. To this latter end, the Government\u201fs 2005 Consultation \nPaper objected to images of \u201ethe torture of (mostly female) victims\u201f, explicitly \nreferring to the need to proscribe \u201esites featuring violent rape scenes\u201f.120 It expressed \nconcern for those who \u201eparticipate in the creation of sexual material containing \nviolence\u201f and defended action on the basis that extreme pornography may \u201eencourage\u201f \n                                                 \n115\n  Report of the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship (Chair: Bernard Williams) Cmnd \n7772 (1979) at 95.

This new offence would \nsupplement the existing Obscene Publications Act 1959 which only criminalises the \nproduction and dissemination of \u201eobscene\u201f materials.  \n \nInstantly, the fundamentalist flames were fanned. Liberal fundamentalists \nimmediately challenged the proposals, raising the spectre of an \u201eOrwellian victimless \ncrime enforced by Thought Police\u201f.122 Moreover, these \u201ethought police\u201f were going to \nbe very busy, criminalising the \u201emillions\u201f who use the pornographic material to be \ncovered.\n123\n The Bar Council worried that those who perused images of anal rape in \nvideo recordings of Howard Brenton\u201fs Romans in Britain might find themselves up \nbefore the Bench.\n124\n Of course, such a recording would never come within the scope \nof the measures, not being explicit, or pornographic or involving life-threatening or \nserious injury.\n125\n But as the debate heated up, common-sense melted away. Julian \nPetley lamented the prevalence of \u201eover-heated language\u201f, the fact that in these \ndebates \u201esheer assertion takes the place of rational argument\u201f. The fault was obvious: \nanti-pornography feminists are \u201enot exactly people with open minds on the subject of \npornography\u201f.126 The proposed legislation, Petley advised, \u201eputs nanny firmly into \njackboots\u201f. And the Government, clearly, is \u201ehappy\u201f to align itself with the regimes of \n\u201eSaudi Arabia, China and South Korea\u201f, he concluded portentously; overcome at the \nlast, it seemed, by the irresistible urge to \u201esheer\u201f, and ever more absurd, \u201eassertion\u201f.127  \n                                                 \n121\n  Home Office, Consultation: On the Possession of Extreme Pornographic Material (London: \nHome Office, 2005), at 2 and paras 34 and 27.  \n122\n  The Campaign Against Censorship, quoted in McGlynn and Rackley, above n 6 at 677-678. \nThe vast majority of responses to the 2005 consultation are available at: \nhttp:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/law\/research\/politicsofporn\/responses\/ [last visited 26 February 2009].  \n123\n  As suggested by the group \u201ebacklash\u201f which was formed to fight the proposals.

Another feminist group advocated inclusion of \u201ethe \nwritten text as well as visual imagery\u201f.132 \n \nMoral fundamentalists reacted just as strongly to the proposals. Mediawatch-\nuk reaffirmed that all pornography, because of its \u201ecasual, immoral and responsibility-\nfree approach to sexuality, contributes significantly to the social problems of sexual \ndysfunction, the continually rising rates of sexually transmitted infections, the \nincreasing rate of marital breakdown and the annually rising sexual crime rate\u201f. It also \n\u201eencourages a distorted attitude to human sexuality\u201f.133 The Conservative Party \nexpressed its concern over images which are \u201edeeply depraved and corrupting\u201f.134 The \nLawyers\u201f Christian Fellowship maintained that all pornography \u201eencourages a \ndistorted and selfish view of sexuality\u201f which \u201edivorces sex from love and tenderness\u201f \nand demanded sex education which focuses on \u201esex in a positive way, emphasising \nthat it finds it proper and most fulfilling place within a marriage between a man and a \nwoman\u201f.135 A number of police forces responded in similar fashion. The Kent \nconstabulary argued for an extension to cover written material, whilst their colleagues \nin the West Midlands voiced a peculiar concern about images which might depict the \n\u201eeating of faeces or urine\u201f.136  \n \nIt was readily apparent that tempers would again be high, that argument would \nveer toward the extremes and that easy accommodation would be impossible. Perhaps \nnot surprisingly, the Government\u201fs amended proposals presented in 2006 evidenced a \n                                                 \n128\n  Feminists Against Censorship, equally unsurprisingly, represented the only significant \nfeminist exception to the broadly supportive reception. \n129\n  Justice for Women, above n 122.  \n130\n  Respectively, Justice for Women and the pressure group Object, above n 122 \n131\n  Lilith, above n 122. \n132\n  Wearside Women in Need, above n 122. \n133\n  Mediawatch-uk, response available at:  \nhttp:\/\/www.mediawatchuk.org.uk\/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=238&Itemid=124 \n[last visited 26 February 2009].  \n134\n  Conservative Party, above n 122. \n135\n  Lawyers\u201f Christian Fellowship, above n 122. \n136\n  Both responses available at n 122. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 19 \ngrowing temerity.\n137\n The idea of criminalizing images of sexual violence was \nsuperseded by a concern with pornographic acts of \u201eserious violence\u201f alone. Such \n\u201eserious\u201f images, it was now proposed, would have to \u201eappear to be life threatening\u201f \nor \u201elikely to result in serious, disabling injury\u201f. Such stipulations, most obviously the \ninsertion of a criterion of apparent \u201einjury\u201f, were clearly intended to lend a little \ndefinitional veracity. But they were also limiting. Rape referents were erased; even \nthough independently commissioned research for the Ministry of Justice concluded \nthat the link between pornography and rape was demonstrable.\n138\n By the time the draft \nBill was published a year later, the provisions were further restricted in scope, now \nonly covering images of an act which \u201ethreatens or appears to threaten a person\u201fs life\u201f \nor \u201ean act which results in or appears to result (or be likely to result) in serious injury \nto a person\u201fs anus, breasts or genitals\u201f.139 By the time the legislation received Royal \nAssent, yet another threshold had been inserted, namely that the \u201eextreme image\u201f must \nalso be one which is \u201egrossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene \ncharacter\u201f.140 Much had changed in three years.141 \n \nClearly the ferocity of the debate caught the Government by surprise. Liberty \ncastigated the \u201ecarelessly drafted, over-broad\u201f language of the statute; the sort of \ncriticisms which can only explain the Government\u201fs oddly precise physiological \nenunciation of \u201eanus, breasts or genitals\u201f.142 Moral fundamentalists were to be sated \nwith the statutory instantiation of the terms \u201edisgusting\u201f, \u201eobscene\u201f and \u201egrossly \noffensive\u201f; a new target for creative debate and interpretation. Least effective in the \nfight over statutory language, it appears, were the anti-pornography feminists. An \nimmediate absurdity inherent in the new measures is that while the possession of \npornographic images of intercourse or oral sex with animals is criminalized, this is not \nthe case for all pornographic images of sexual violence. Most particularly, to all \nintents and purposes, pornographic rape images will not now come within the scope \nof the measures.\n143\n The failure to include such paradigmatic images of sexual violence \n                                                 \n137\n  Home Office, Consultation on the Possession of Extreme Pornographic Material \u2013 summary \nof responses and next steps (London: Home Office, 2006).  \n138\n  Above n 30. The report itself has been subject to detailed criticism for its methodology and \nconclusions. The principal point here, however, is the dissonance between the Government\u201fs use of this \nreport to justify its proposals which by and large exclude images of rape, and the fact that the report \nlargely relies on studies considering the effect of pornographic images of rape to reach its conclusions. \n139\n  It further sought to criminalize images of necrophilia and of sexual activity with animals.

The specification of \u201eanus, breasts or genitals\u201f evidences the lack of understanding \nthat the harm of extreme pornography is not simply that of violence against specific body parts.  \n143\n  Depictions of rape which are life-threatening or which involve serious injury to the anus or \ngenitals will fall within the scope of the measures, but this excludes all other, indeed the vast majority, \nof rapes. See further McGlynn and Rackley, \u201eLost Opportunity\u201f, above n 141, at 249-250. This is a \nlacuna set to be rectified in the Scottish measures on extreme pornography which, as currently \nproposed, are to include images of \u201erape and other non- consensual penetrative sexual activity, whether \nviolent or otherwise\u201f: see Scottish Executive, Revitalising Justice - Proposals To Modernise And \nImprove The Criminal Justice System, 25 September 2008, available at:    \nhttp:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Publications\/2008\/09\/24132838\/0 [last visited 26 February 2009]. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 20 \nsays much about the progress of debate and negotiation. It further confirms that, for \nall the Government\u201fs warm words in the initial consultation, it feared the \ndisapprobation of the liberal and moral fundamentalists rather more than that of the \nanti-pornography feminists.  \n \nAt this point, the liberal humanist may be disappointed, but not too surprised. \nThe disappointment is rooted in the knowledge that the existence of internet sites \nwhich trade under the nomenclature rapepassion.com or rapedbitch.com add nothing \nto the cause of human dignity, or indeed make our society a kinder, more \ncompassionate or more human place. It is confirmed by the realisation that the new \nprovisions will add little to the regulation of such sites, or the posting or downloading \nof images of a violent sexual nature, that they fall well short of the kind of \nproscription which might have been reasonably expected, at least in a society which \npresumes to set itself against the glorification of misogyny. And s\/he will wonder \nwhy. There is no pretension to art here, no attempt to explore the deeper emotional \nreaches of human engagement. It is hardly likely that internet providers would have \nsuccessfully pressed a Convention right. And to suggest that criminalizing the \npossession of such images might have a \u201echilling\u201f effect on so-called \u201erights\u201f of free \nexpression stretches credence. No such absolute rights exist in practice; at least not in \nthe real world. And to repeat Stanley Fish\u201fs famous aside, to which the liberal \nhumanist would nod vigorously, it is a good thing too.\n144\n As Cass Sunstein rightly \nargued long ago, some speech is \u201ehigh-value\u201f and some is \u201elow-value\u201f.145 The screams \nof pain and misery which tend to accompany images of extreme pornography fall into \nthe latter category.   \n \nThe concern for practicality, for addressing real harms and real injustices, will \nconfirm this sense of regret. Not only would little to be lost by the closer proscription \nof sites such as rapedbitch.com, or any of the others which the likes of Graham Coutts \nfind so addictive, but so too would there be much to be gained. Regulation of such \nforms of \u201eexpression\u201f does not need to satisfy the more esoteric demands of moral \nepistemology or abstract jurisprudence. Sense, understood as an expression of \npractical reason, and human sensitivity, the twin constituents of what Nussbaum terms \nan \u201eintelligent\u201f liberalism, is enough.146 The \u201eharms\u201f of extreme pornography are not \nlocated in any comprehensive theory; and they do not need to be. They are, instead, \nexpressed in a violence that is politically constructed and culturally embedded.\n147\n A \nsociety that really aspires to be compassionate, that wishes to do more than simply \npay lip-service to the idea of justice, will address such harms undeterred by the \nabstruse distractions of the liberal fundamentalist.  \n \nAt the same time, this pragmatic bent of the liberal humanist furnishes at least \nsome consolation, even reconciliation, from the inroads that have been made. The \nsheer existence and prevalence of extreme pornography is now a part of public \n                                                 \n144\n  See, Stanley Fish, There\u2019s No Such Thing as Free Speech, and Its a Good Thing Too (Oxford: \nOxford University Press, 1994), particularly 111-15. \n145\n  The importance of liberals recognising the pragmatic necessity of distinguishing \u201elow-value\u201f \nand \u201ehigh-value\u201f speech is strongly made by Sunstein, above n 32, at 602-9 and also 616-18. For \nsimilar observations see also Scoccia, above n 57, at 795-9. \n146\n  See Nussbaum, Humanity, above n 43, at 10-11, and Rorty, Contingency, above n 67, at 176-\n7. Susan Easton urges a similar justification, above n 51, at 16-17. \n147\n  For more on the concept of \u201ecultural harm\u201f as a justification for pornography regulation, see \nMcGlynn and Rackley, \u201eLost Opportunity\u201f, above n 141, at 256-259. \nPublished in (2009) 36(3) Journal of Law and Society 327-351 \n \n 21 \nknowledge, and public debate. The use of such materials has been challenged; \nresponsibility has been broadened to include not only those who produce and \ndisseminate extreme pornography, but also those who access and use it, who feed the \ntrade. Some may be deterred, some may be prosecuted. Perhaps more importantly \npublic consciousness about the cultural harm of extreme pornography will be raised.  \n \nAnd so, leaving the bickering fundamentalists to their endless squabbles, the \nstatutory drafters to their agonies of imprecision, and the politicians to their wild \noscillations between rhetorical rage and legislative temerity, the liberal humanist \nsimply moves on. Rather than trying to make people more virtuous, or better aware of \ntheir supposed rights, or possessed of a more acute perception of the difference \nbetween eroticism and pornography, s\/he prefers to get on with the business of \naddressing the various little \u201econtingencies\u201f that make the lives of those with whom \ns\/he lives that little bit more, or that little bit less, edifying.\n148\n The primary \nresponsibility here, as both Nussbaum and Rorty repeatedly urge, is to \u201ehelp\u201f real \npeople resolve \u201ereal problems\u201f.149 The continued existence of internet sites such as \nrapedbitch.com is a problem. The violence inflicted upon women such as Jane \nLonghurst is all too real. There is much still to be done. And much that can be done. \nThe liberal humanist jurist knows that law is anyway a limited instrument; often \nuseful, rarely sufficient.\n150\n Exorcising extreme pornography will require \ncomplementary economic and cultural strategies, perhaps punitive tax regimes or civil \nordinances indeed, educational programs certainly. It will take time.  \n \nAnd more debate, much more; for the liberal humanist also knows that the \nconversation will continue, as it always does. And s\/he cherishes this thought; not \nleast because it further leavens the immediate sense of disappointment. Of course the \nmeasures which finally crept onto the statute book in the 2008 Act disappoint, a pale \nimitation of the original draft provisions presented three years ago. In their present \nform they will probably not save the next Jane Longhurst, anymore than they will \ndeter the next Graham Coutts. But they represent another stage in a particular history \nthat is constantly in the writing.\n151\n This is how a liberal democracy operates, \ninherently agonistic, the construct of myriad conversations and debates, all organic, \nall ongoing.\n152\n It makes progress by \u201emuddling through\u201f, and is happy to do so, not \nbecause it is preferable to any other mode of operation, but because it is the only \nmode of operation.\n153\n Progress, it might be said of the 2008 provisions, has been \n                                                 \n148\n  See Rorty, Consequences, above n 68, at 165-6, 189, discussing the idea of a politics as a \nmatter of resolving \u201econtingencies\u201f, and also Mirror, above n 68, at 370-2, for the liberal pragmatist\u201fs \nprimary responsibility for enhancing that which \u201eedifies\u201f our lives. \n149\n  See Rorty, Philosophy as Cultural Politics, above n 68, at 79 and also Nussbaum, Sex, above \nn 74, at 5-6, 9-10, explicitly recommending the greater need to address the \u201ereal\u201f harms that women \nsuffer in their daily lives. \n150\n  Nussbaum, Poetic Justice, above n 76, at 119-20.
