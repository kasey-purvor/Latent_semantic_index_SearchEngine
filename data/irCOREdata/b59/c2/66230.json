In some situations, this\nraises serious ethical questions.\nConclusions: Guidelines dealing with confidentiality in practitioner-patient relationships in medical\npractice have long been available and have recently been restated, specifically in relation to the prac-\ntice of sports medicine, by the British Olympic Association, the British Medical Association, and the\nFootball Association. This is a welcome first step. However, if the guidelines are to have an impact on\npractice, detailed consideration needs to be given to ensuring their effective implementation; if this is\nto be achieved, consideration also needs to be given to identifying those aspects of the culture and\norganisation of professional football clubs that may hinder the full and effective implementation of those\nguidelines.\nThe role of the club doctor in sport is sometimes likened tothat of the \u201cold fashioned family doctor\u201d, although thiscomparison is in many respects misleading. The relation-\nship between doctor (or other health professional) and patient\nis normally underpinned by a number of fundamental\nassumptions: (a) the doctor\u2019s skill is used exclusively on behalf\nof the patient; (b) the doctor is not acting as an agent on behalf\nof anybody else whose interests may conflict with those of the\npatient; (c) the doctor may be trusted with private or intimate\ninformation which he\/she will treat confidentially and not\ndivulge to others.\nHowever, these assumptions may not apply in the same way,\nor to the same degree, in the work situation of the club doctor\nor physiotherapist in professional sport; as Bottomley1 has\nnoted, the \u201cteam doctor, having been invited by the club or\ngoverning body of the sport in question, is acting as an agent\nof that club or body\u201d. But if the team doctor and physiothera-\npist are agents of the club, how can they simultaneously act as\nagents for, and on behalf of, the individual player as patient?\nIn the above context, one obvious area for potential\nproblems relates to medical confidentiality. The Arsenal and\nEngland team doctor2 has written that the rules of confiden-\ntiality governing relationships between the club doctor and\nplayers are not those that apply in general practice, but rather\nthose that apply to the relationship \u201cbetween an occupational\nphysician and an employee of a company\u201d. In this respect, he\nnoted that the physician \u201cmay be employed by the company\nprimarily to serve its interest. There may arise, therefore, a\nconflict of loyalties . . .\u201d. A similar point has been made by\nGraf-Baumann.3 Writing as a member of the Sports Medical\nCommittee of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football\nAssociation (FIFA), he has noted that: \u201cPressure from officials,\nthe media or even sponsors can lead to a conflict of interests\u201d,\nand he added that a \u201cparticularly sensitive problem in football\nand in all prominent sports is that of confidentiality and\nprofessional secrecy in dealing with information on an\nathlete\u2019s physical and mental condition\u201d. Mellion and Walsh,4\nwriting from an American perspective, have similarly noted\nthat, in sports clubs, confidentiality is \u201coften compromised\u201d by\nthe physician\u2019s relationship to the club and that \u201cinformation\nis seldom held in the strict doctor-patient confidentiality\u201d.\nHow, then, do club doctors and physiotherapists deal with\ndelicate issues involving doctor-patient confidentiality? For\nexample, how much information about the players\u2019 health is\ncommunicated to the team coach or manager? Is such\ninformation confined to the players\u2019 injury status, or does it\ninclude information that the manager may want, but which\nwould normally be considered confidential to the doctor-\npatient relationship, such as information relating to a player\u2019s\nlifestyle? And what do club medical staff do if they discover\nthat a player is consuming large amounts of alcohol or is ille-\ngally using drugs? Are such problems handled within the\nconfidentiality of the doctor-patient relationship, or do doctors\nfeel that, as the club employs them, they are under an obliga-\ntion to inform the manager about aspects of a player\u2019s lifestyle\nthat may affect his performance? Although these questions\nhave all been phrased in relation to the club doctor, they also\napply equally, of course, to the club physiotherapist. The cen-\ntral focus of this paper is the way in which confidential mat-\nters are dealt with in English professional football clubs in the\ncontext of the relationship between the doctor (or physio-\ntherapist) and the individual player as patient.\nSee end of article for\nauthors\u2019 affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Waddington, Centre for\nResearch into Sport and\nSociety, 14 Salisbury\nRoad, Leicester LE1 7QR,\nUK; iw11@leicester.ac.uk\nAccepted\n6 December 2001\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n118\nwww.bjsportmed.com\nMETHODS\nThese issues were probed as part of a broader study of club\ndoctors and physiotherapists conducted on behalf of the\nProfessional Footballers Association.5 Some results from this\nstudy have been published already, describing the constraints\non players to continue playing while injured,6 and the qualifi-\ncations, experience, and methods of appointment of club\ndoctors.7 The present paper is based primarily on data\ncollected by tape recorded, face to face interviews of between\n30 and 60 minutes with 12 club doctors, 10 club physiothera-\npists, and 19 current and eight former players. Interviewees\nwere given guarantees that neither they nor their clubs would\nbe identified.\nDoctors in the Premier League were more amenable to being\ninterviewed, a fact that probably reflected their generally\ngreater involvement in their clubs. However, this did mean\nthat the sample of doctors interviewed was biased towards\nclub doctors in the Premiership. Of the 12 interviews, seven\nwere with doctors at clubs in the Premier League (one had\nrecently left the club to return full time to general practice),\ntwo were with doctors at clubs in the First Division of the\nNationwide League, two with doctors at Second Division\nclubs, and one interview was with a doctor in a Third Division\nclub; one of the Premier League club doctors had also\npreviously worked in a Second Division club.\nOf the club physiotherapists, three worked in Premier\nLeague clubs, two in First Division clubs, two in Second Divi-\nsion clubs, and two in Third Division clubs; in addition, one\nphysiotherapist had formerly worked in two football clubs\n(one Third Division club, one Premier League club) but now\nworked as a club physiotherapist in another sport. Nineteen\ncurrent and eight former players were also interviewed in\norder to get the \u201cpatient\u2019s perspective\u201d.\nThe larger study also included a questionnaire which was\nsent to 90 club doctors who were not interviewed; 58\nquestionnaires were returned. This paper, however, draws pri-\nmarily on data obtained from the 49 interviews with doctors,\nphysiotherapists, and players.\nRESULTS\nThe most general finding\u2014and one that we believe is a matter\nof concern\u2014is that there is among club doctors and\nphysiotherapists no commonly held code of ethics governing\nthe way in which confidential issues are handled, and there\nare considerable variations in terms of both the amount, and\nthe kind, of information about players that doctors and physi-\notherapists pass on to managers. This lack of a common ethi-\ncal code for dealing with confidential issues was particularly\nstriking among physiotherapists, but, although there was\nmore uniformity in terms of the responses of club doctors,\nthere were nevertheless some concerns about the ethics of the\nbehaviour of some doctors; a particularly striking example of\nunethical behaviour on the part of a club doctor is cited later.\nMost club doctors are general practitioners,7 and many seek,\ninsofar as it is possible to do so, to apply the rules governing\nconfidentiality in general practice to their practice within the\nfootball club. Asked about how issues involving patient confi-\ndentiality were best dealt with, one doctor replied:\n\u201cI find this one very difficult because coming from a back-\nground in general practice obviously anything between a\npatient and myself is confidential, unless it\u2019s an absolutely\nextreme case . . . Whereas inside a football club, it seems like\neverybody else thinks they have the right to know what\u2019s\ngoing on before the player does and when I have had\ndisagreements with managers it\u2019s usually been around this\nissue. There\u2019s also the question of the press, and I think that\nthe right of confidentiality still holds. I don\u2019t see why it should\nbe different because you\u2019re in a football club.\u201d\nAsked about the appropriate way to handle a situation in\nwhich a player is drinking heavily, this doctor said:\n\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t tell the physio or the manager or the\nboard unless he said that it was alright for me to do so. I don\u2019t\nthink he would. [I would] see whether he would let me get the\nPFA [Professional Footballers Association] involved, or where\nhe would accept help, just like in general practice . . . it\u2019s the\nsame with drugs . . . I wouldn\u2019t tell the manager unless he told\nme to. I would consider that as a breach of my confidentiality\nif I told. I mean, that has happened to me [a player using\ndrugs] and I have dealt with it like I would any patient.\u201d\nThis doctor summed up the problem of dual loyalties\u2014to\nthe club as employer and to the player as patient\u2014in the fol-\nlowing way:\n\u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself the players\u2019 doctor. You\nknow, it is more difficult because I am employed by the club . . .\nfortunately I haven\u2019t had the situation where the club would\nbe at risk, but it would make it more difficult. But I would\nalways try to get the player\u2019s consent before I involved\nanybody else.\u201d\nAnother doctor took a broadly similar line in relation to\npatient confidentiality. Asked about the best way to deal with\na situation in which a player confided that he was drinking\nheavily, this doctor replied:\n\u201cWe would sit down and have a talk about it. I have a very\nstrong feeling about confidentiality with the players. If I tell\nsomebody that they\u2019re telling me something in confidence\nthen it doesn\u2019t go any further, and I\u2019m sure there are things\nthat I\u2019ll probably carry to my grave that people have told me as\nplayers that I wouldn\u2019t say to anybody unless they said, \u2018Yes,\nOK, I\u2019m happy to talk about it\u2019. So I would try to sort out with\nthem what to do, between the two of us.\u201d\nThis doctor indicated that he would encourage the player to\ntalk to the manager, but that if the player did not wish the\nmanager to know, then he could not pass on that information:\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell the manager . . . I think players, in order to come\nto you with confidences have to be very sure that they can\nreally trust you because clubs are places where that kind of\nthing goes around in a flash and sometimes physios aren\u2019t as\ndiscreet as they should be about that kind of thing, and I see\nmy role as being somebody who people can trust, things will\ngo no further.\u201d\nAlthough most doctors sought to apply within the club the\nsame rules governing confidentiality that they applied in gen-\neral practice, one doctor differentiated very clearly between his\nrole as an occupational physician for the club, and his role as\npersonal physician to the players. He said that, in the former\nrole:\n\u201cin respect of what I do with [the players], I share the\ninformation with their employer. I also have a personal physi-\ncian role which means that things that are said between the\ntwo of us are entirely confidential and I will not discuss them\nat all with anyone else unless I have their permission . . . if\nthere is information that\u2019s coming to me that I feel\ncompromises the position of the club, compromises the\nposition of the team, that compromises the well-being of the\nclub, I will say to them: \u2018Right. You\u2019ve told me this now. This is\nsomething that I feel should be shared with the manager . . .\nand if you don\u2019t want me to share it, don\u2019t go into this any\nfurther. You\u2019re going to have to discuss this with somebody\ndifferent\u2019.\nIt\u2019s always been agreed between us that there are two roles\nthat I have. It\u2019s not like a normal doctor-patient relationship.\u201d\nOne of the doctors cited above suggested that \u201csometimes\nphysios aren\u2019t as discreet as they should be\u201d, and it is certainly\nthe case that there was considerable variation between physi-\notherapists in terms of how they dealt with issues involving\nconfidentiality. It might be argued that, in relation to such\nissues, physiotherapists have a particular ethical responsibility\nbecause, as one experienced physiotherapist pointed out,\nphysiotherapists\u2014perhaps more so than doctors, most of\nwhom work only part time at the club\u2014often get to know a\ngreat deal about players\u2019 private lives:\nManaging confidentiality in professional football clubs 119\nwww.bjsportmed.com\n\u201cI could tell you more about any player in the football club\nthan the manager, chairman, coach together, because you\nwork one-to-one with them. You get to know, not just the\nproblems themselves, but the families that they have, the chil-\ndren . . . everything about them because you spend time with\nthem and, you know, you\u2019re not prying, you\u2019re just asking\nquestions all the time.\u201d\nThis particular physiotherapist was clearly aware of his\nresponsibilities to the club\u2014he said that, if a player had a\nproblem that was affecting the team, then \u201cit\u2019s better that the\nmanager knew\u201d\u2014but he emphasised, in particular, his\nresponsibilities to the players and, in this context, he adopted\na position in relation to confidentiality that was not very far\nremoved from that expressed by several doctors. He said, for\nexample, that normally he would not tell the manager if a\nplayer was drinking excessively\u2014\u201ca manager\u2019s got enough to\ndo without worrying about people who drink\u201d\u2014or if a player\nwas using \u201csocial\u201d drugs such as marijuana:\n\u201cI know an awful lot of things about players that needn\u2019t go\nany further. It\u2019s important it doesn\u2019t go any further . . . if you\nfind something out, or the player tells you something in confi-\ndence and they ask you not to tell anyone, then you keep that\nconfidence . . . they tell you an awful lot in confidence and if\nyou went running to the manager with everything then you\nwouldn\u2019t probably find these things out.\u201d\nA player at another club described how the physiotherapist\nnot only did not tell the manager that a particular player was\ndrinking heavily, but actually sought\u2014as this player put it\u2014to\n\u201cprotect\u201d the player from the manager:\n\u201cI used to get changed next to [the player] and . . . at times\nwhen he was a bit worse for wear he\u2019d come into the treatment\nroom and [the physiotherapist] would protect him and maybe\nsay he\u2019d got a sore so and so and he couldn\u2019t train that day. Or\nsometimes, if [the player] had to go out training he would call\nhim back over and say that there\u2019s a telephone call or whatever\nto get him out early. He would protect him that way.\u201d\nOther physiotherapists, however, appeared to see their\nprimary responsibility towards the club and to the manager,\nand some of these expressed a greater readiness to pass on\ninformation. Thus one physiotherapist, when asked what\ninformation he passed on to the manager, explained, without\nany further prompting:\n\u201cMost physios know more about their staff than anybody in\nthe club, and if it was beneficial that the manager should\nknow [something]\u2014or essential that the manager should\nknow\u2014then I would tell him.\u201d\nAsked whether he would inform the manager if a player is\ndrinking heavily, he replied:\n\u201cThe problem is that I\u2019m employed by the football club. I\u2019m\nemployed by the manager and I\u2019m supposed to be working\nwith him and if I withhold information which he thinks he\nshould have, then he would say that I wasn\u2019t working for the\nclub or for him, so it puts me in a difficult position . . . if I didn\u2019t\ndivulge what I knew and then it came out afterwards, we\u2019re in\nhot water . . . If I thought it was beneficial to the club . . . that\nhe should know, then I would say. \u201d\nAnother physiotherapist who placed particular emphasis on\nhis responsibility to the club said:\n\u201cI think if [a player\u2019s] breaking the law, i.e. taking drugs,\nwhether performance-enhancing or whether they were just\nrecreational, I think it\u2019s my duty to tell the football club. I work\nfor the football club. And the players know where I sit. I\u2019m not\na player. I don\u2019t know who they\u2019ve shagged, I don\u2019t know what\nthey\u2019ve drunk and I don\u2019t want to know what substances\nthey\u2019re taking. They can do what the f*** they want. If they tell\nme, it will go back. And the players know that.\nIf they come to me confidentially and they\u2019re breaking the\nlaw, it will go back. If they\u2019re not breaking the law\u2014I don\u2019t\nmind if they\u2019re out nightclubbing twice a week, I\u2019m not judge\nand jury\u2014but if the performance on the pitch . . . [if] they\u2019re\nnot performing well or they\u2019re getting muscular irritations,\nand I know their lifestyle\u2019s all over the place . . . I would go to\nthe manager and say, \u2018Look, his lifestyle is in a right mess\u2019.\u201d\nGiven the considerable variation in terms of the way in\nwhich physiotherapists\u2014and also, to some extent, doctors\u2014\ndeal with issues involving confidentiality, it is perhaps not\nsurprising that some players expressed considerable reserva-\ntions about revealing confidential information to club medical\nstaff. One player, asked whether he would be happy to discuss\na confidential matter with the club doctor or physiotherapist,\nanswered with an emphatic \u201cNo\u201d. He explained:\n\u201cThings get back. Things get back all the time. You can\u2019t say\nanything at a football club to anyone because basically they get\nback. There is no such thing as confidentiality at a football\nclub. I found that out . . . something got back to a manager that\nI had said to a doctor . . . Well, it should be confidential . . . it\nwas something [non-medical] I commented on . . . and it came\nstraight back which I thought was a bit out of order. No, I\nwouldn\u2019t have confidence in anyone.\u201d\nOne ex-player, asked if confidential information about\nplayers was ever passed on by the physiotherapist, said:\n\u201cI think maybe that happened at [the club] sometimes,\nwhere you\u2019d say So-and-so is the gaffer\u2019s eyes and ears . . . in\nthe treatment room. I think the manager does have certain\nmembers of his staff to listen out to what players are saying in\nthe treatment room . . . word quickly gets round who you\nshould be careful of saying things to . . . players do tend to open\ntheir hearts out in there when they are on a bed for half an\nhour or more, or under a machine, and they just talk and\nthings come out and, you know, really if the physio is hearing\nthat type of stuff it should be for his ears only and really\nshouldn\u2019t go any further.\nI mean . . . if he was a normal physio [and] he\u2019d got a private\npractice, of course he wouldn\u2019t mention things his patients\nhad said. It is a slightly different situation in a football club . . .\nbecause the manager\u2019s his boss and if the manager asks him\nsomething he might feel duty bound to tell him . . . So, with\nsomebody in that position, it\u2019s not just a question of treating\n[the players] and whatever they say stays there.\u201d\nAnother senior player indicated that a particular cause for\nconcern was where a new manager came to the club and\nbrought with him his own \u201cbackroom staff\u201d, including the\nphysiotherapist, from a previous club:\n\u201cWhen a manager brings in his own people, that is where\nthere is concern because this person is relying on the manager\nfor his job and he\u2019s not going to go against the manager.\u201d\nHe indicated that under a previous manager:\n\u201cAnything that was said in the physio\u2019s room went straight\nback to the manager. The manager had a huge input, even in\nthe physio\u2019s room.\u201d\nPlayers, he said, joked about this situation, but were very\ncareful about what they said in the physiotherapist\u2019s room.\nIt was not, however, just in relation to physiotherapists that\nplayers expressed reservations about the degree to which\ninformation that they provided would be held in confidence,\nfor some players also expressed reservations in this regard\nabout club doctors and one player provided a striking example\nof unprofessional conduct on the part of the club doctor.\nIn this incident, the club doctor was clearly acting as an\nagent on behalf of the club, and used confidential medical\ninformation about a player to advance the interests of the club\nover and against those of the player. The player described what\nhappened as follows:\n\u201cThe club doctor, in my opinion, totally compromised his\nsituation. I\u2019d had [an operation] and my contract was up at the\nend of the season . . . I was approached by [three leading Eng-\nlish clubs], Atletico Madrid, and Lyon. Three or four weeks\nlater, when I was talking to these clubs, I got summoned to the\nclub doctor\u2019s . . . the club doctor called me and said would I go\nround to his house . . . I arrived there and he was there with\nthe surgeon who did my operation . . . the surgeon wasn\u2019t par-\nticularly happy about being there. He [the club doctor] said,\n120 I Waddington, M Roderick\nwww.bjsportmed.com\n\u2018You\u2019re thinking about leaving the club this summer?\u2019 I said\n\u2018Yes\u2019. He said, \u2018Well, the surgeon has told us that you\u2019ve only\ngot another year at the most to play football. If we make that\ncommon knowledge, no club in the world would pay millions\nof pounds for you\u2019. I said, \u2018Well, what are you telling me?\u2019 He\nsaid, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re thinking of leaving the club and we made\nthat common knowledge, then . . . no-one would buy you\u2019.\nSo . . . I ended up agreeing a new deal to stay.\u201d\nThe incident described by the player had taken place several\nyears previously and, at the time of the interview, the player\nwas still playing for the same club. The player said that he\nthought the club doctor was probably acting under great pres-\nsure, not in this case from the manager but from the club\nchairman, but he added that this did not excuse the doctor\u2019s\nbehaviour: \u201cHe was probably under great pressure to do that,\nbut he\u2019s done wrong\u201d.\nDISCUSSION\nThere is considerable variation from one club to another\nin terms of the amount and kind of information about\nplayers that is communicated to the manager by doctors\nand physiotherapists. In some clubs, medical staff try to\noperate more or less on the basis of the rules governing\nconfidentiality that apply in general practice, but, in other\nclubs, doctors and\/or physiotherapists are much more ready\nto pass on personal information about players. This lack of\nuniformity in terms of ethical standards is a matter of\nconcern.\nAlthough this paper is concerned specifically with the situ-\nation in English professional football, there is no reason to\nsuppose that the problems we have documented are confined\neither to football or to England. For example, as we noted in\nthe introduction, Graf-Baumann3 has pointed out that\nconfidentiality is a \u201cparticularly sensitive problem\u201d not just in\nfootball but in all prominent sports, and Mellion and Walsh4\nhave similarly drawn attention to the fact that in sports in the\nUnited States confidentiality is \u201coften compromised\u201d by the\nphysician\u2019s relationship to the club. Of course, the magnitude\nof the problem is likely to vary from one country to another\nand from one sport to another, perhaps depending on the\nimportance attached to winning and the associated commer-\ncial, media, and other pressures to succeed, as well as other\nsport specific factors. Unfortunately there are almost no\nsystematic data available that would shed light on these issues\nfor, although there are numerous general statements of prin-\nciple setting out guidelines for the behaviour of physicians\nworking with sports clubs, our own study is, as far as we are\naware, the only completed empirical study that has examined\nnot how club doctors and physiotherapists ought to behave, in\nterms of general ethical principles, but how, as a matter of fact,\nthey actually do behave in situations involving medical confi-\ndentiality.\nIn relation to this last point, it may be of interest to note that\na study similar to the one reported here, but in relation to\nrugby union, is currently being undertaken by colleagues at\nthe University of Leicester. The one early paper that has been\npublished from this research8 does not deal with issues involv-\ning confidentiality, but preliminary results from the study do\nsuggest that breaches of confidentiality may be less common\nin rugby union than in football. If this preliminary finding is\nconfirmed, then it may be that it can be explained in terms of\na variety of sport specific considerations, including the follow-\ning: commercial and media pressures, although increasing in\nrugby, are less intense than in football; in rugby all club physi-\notherapists, unlike their counterparts in football, appear to be\nchartered; and in rugby there is considerably less movement of\nboth players and managers\/coaches from club to club, which\nmay facilitate the development of more stable and perhaps\nmore trusting relationships between players and manage-\nment. Clearly what is needed are more detailed empirical\nstudies of the ways in which issues involving confidentiality\nare handled within the context of different elite\/professional\nsports.\nMore or less concurrently with the research reported here,\nthree major organisations have recently issued guidelines\ndealing with confidentiality in sports related contexts. The\nBritish Olympic Association (BOA)9 issued in 2000 a position\nstatement on athlete confidentiality, and, in the following\nyear, the British Medical Association10 issued advice for\ndoctors working with sports clubs, which included a\nstatement of doctors\u2019 responsibilities in relation to confiden-\ntiality. The medical committee of the English Football Associ-\nation (FA) also introduced, in February 2001, guidelines relat-\ning to confidentiality for club medical and support staff.11\nAll three documents emphasise the importance of main-\ntaining confidentiality within the relationship between the\ndoctor\/physiotherapist and the athlete\/player as patient. For\nexample, the FA guidelines, which draw heavily on the BOA\ndocument, state that \u201cthe duty of confidentiality of [medical]\nstaff to the player overrides the contractual obligations owed\nto the employer\u201d. It notes that managers\/coaches may want to\nbe informed about matters relating to a player\u2019s health, but\nstates that such information should only be passed on with\nthe consent of the player concerned.\nIn considering these guidelines, perhaps the first point to\nnote is that, as an editorial by Macauley and Bartlett in this\njournal12 pointed out, the BOA position statement does not\ninvolve a statement of any new principles but \u201cdraws together\nand explains the implications of the Codes of Conduct that\nalready exist among medical and scientific support staff\u201d. In\nthis sense, these documents simply reaffirm what has long\nbeen the general understanding, of both patients and medical\npractitioners, in relation to such issues: that when a patient\nprovides information to his\/her doctor that information will,\nsave in exceptional circumstances (for example, where\ninformation is required by due legal process), be treated con-\nfidentially. As the General Medical Council succinctly puts it:\n\u201cPatients have a right to expect that [doctors] will not disclose\nany personal information . . . unless they give permission\u201d.13\nThis is of course also the standard position expressed in books\non medical ethics (see, for example, Phillips and Dawson14).\nPerhaps most interestingly, guidance on ethics for occupa-\ntional physicians\u2014and the club doctor can be regarded as a\nparticular kind of occupational physician\u2014was one of the first\nissues addressed when the Faculty of Occupational Medicine\nwas founded in 1978, and, in the most recent edition of its\nGuidance on ethics for occupational physicians,15 the Faculty reiter-\nates the long established position that the consent of the\npatient is required\u2014again save in exceptional and defined\ncircumstances\u2014before access to clinical information is\ngranted to others.\nThe fact that three major organisations\u2014the BOA, the\nBMA, and the FA\u2014have all recently felt the need, specifically\nin relation to sports medicine, to restate ethical principles that\nare generally well understood both within and outside the\nmedical profession does suggest a growing concern about the\nway in which issues involving confidentiality are dealt with in\nsport. The research reported here indicates that, at least in\nrelation to professional football in England, that concern is\njustified. In this context, the FA guidelines represent a\nwelcome first step. They are, however, precisely that: a first\nstep for, as Macauley and Bartlett have correctly pointed out,\n\u201ccreating these [guidelines] is relatively easy; implementation\nis more difficult\u201d.12\nIn this regard, there are several potential problems which\nare likely to be encountered in implementing the guidelines.\nThe most obvious, perhaps, relate to the increasingly intense\ncommercial, media, and other pressures for clubs to achieve\nsuccess on the field of play. These pressures are experienced\nparticularly acutely by the club manager, whose position\nwithin the club is a notoriously insecure one and whose ten-\nure is often very short; one index of this insecurity is that, of\nManaging confidentiality in professional football clubs 121\nwww.bjsportmed.com\nthe 92 clubs in the English Premier League and the\nNationwide League, no fewer than 20 replaced their manager\nin the first three months of the 2001\u20132002 season. These\nintense pressures on managers to achieve success in the short\nterm, and the associated insecurity of their position, have a\nnumber of consequences for the relationships between\nmanagers, players, and medical staff which are likely to make\nit difficult to implement fully and effectively the FA guidelines.\nIn the first place, these pressures on managers to achieve\nsuccess on the field of play mean that, as the FA guidelines put\nit, \u201cmanagers may feel that they should be informed about any\nproblems relating to their squad\u201d. Our own research leads us\nto state the problem in considerably stronger terms, for it is\nclear not only that managers generally do feel that they have a\nright to be informed about problems relating to their players\nbut, rather more worryingly, this view is not uncommonly\nshared by club physiotherapists and doctors. In other words, a\nculture of medical confidentiality is much less well established\nin professional football clubs than in most other contexts in\nwhich medicine is practised. Successful implementation of the\nguidelines will thus require a shift in football club culture\nwhich may not be easy to achieve.\nA further problem is associated with another, related aspect\nof the culture of professional football. As we have documented\nelsewhere,6 professional footballers are subject to strong con-\nstraints to \u201cplay hurt\u201d, that is to continue playing with pain\nand injury. In this connection, one of the things that manag-\ners look for in a player is that he should have what, in profes-\nsional football, is regarded as the \u201cright attitude\u201d, and one way\nthat players can show that they have the \u201cright attitude\u201d is by\nbeing prepared to play with pain and injury. A closely related\naspect of football culture is the idea that players who are\nunable to play because of injury and who can therefore make\nno contribution to the team on the field of play may be seen by\nmanagers as being of little use to the club and may be stigma-\ntised, ignored (some managers simply do not speak to players\nfor the duration of their injury), or deliberately \u201cinconven-\nienced\u201d in other ways, for example by being required to arrive\nat the training ground earlier than players who are fit and by\nbeing kept behind long after the other players have left.6\nThese often unsympathetic attitudes towards injured play-\ners on the part of some managers can be understood, at least\nin part, in relation to the constraints on managers mentioned\nearlier. They do, however, raise obvious difficulties in relation\nto the effective implementation of the FA guidelines. One such\ndifficulty relates to the fact that the guidelines indicate that\ninformation should not be released to managers unless players\nhave signed a consent form. But what does signing such a\nform imply? Does it simply imply permission to reveal\ninformation about a player\u2019s injury status? Or, given the\nparticular conditions characteristic of the culture of profes-\nsional football clubs, will signing a consent form be taken to\nimply that a player agrees to the release of information relat-\ning to more personal matters, such as his lifestyle, which may\ninfluence his performance on the field of play? And if manag-\ners demand such information, to what extent are club doctors,\nand perhaps more especially club physiotherapists, in a\nposition to effectively resist such demands? Such questions\nare, perhaps, particularly pertinent in relation to physiothera-\npists who have a longstanding personal relationship with a\nparticular manager to whom they may feel they owe their job\nand, secondly, to non-chartered physiotherapists who have a\nqualification that is not recognised outside of the football con-\ntext, who may therefore have difficulty in finding another job\nshould their contract be terminated and who may therefore be\nin a weak position to resist such pressure from managers.\nIt is also necessary to ask one other question: what happens\nto players who refuse to sign a consent form? Will their right\nto withhold their consent be recognised and accepted or, given\nthe culture of football and the unsympathetic attitudes of\nsome managers towards injured players, will their refusal to\ngive their consent be taken as an indication that they are\nuncooperative, not \u201cteam players\u201d or, quite simply, that they\ndo not have the \u201cright attitude\u201d? Such questions remain to be\nanswered. In the light of these questions, there is clearly a\nneed for the implementation of the guidelines to be carefully\nmonitored; without such monitoring there is a danger that\nthey may become simply one more policy document to gather\ndust.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was carried out on behalf of the Professional Footballers\nAssociation, who part funded the research.

COMMENTARY .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nThis paper examines the dilemma facing the football club\ndoctor\/physiotherapist when they are presented with confi-\ndential information, often given in good faith by a player. The\ndoctor\/physiotherapist is employed by the club, and the\nauthors of the paper have questioned whether, in this role,\nthey are working in the interests of the club or the player. Tra-\nditionally occupational health doctors are responsible for the\ninterests of the organisation that employs them. Their role is\nconcerned with issues such as fitness for employment, the\nsafety of staff in the work place, and the immediate care of\nindividuals taken ill or injured at work. Primary medical care\nis the responsibility of general practitioners who work\nindependently.\nHealth professionals working in a football club should\ndemarcate their occupational health role from that of the\nplayer\u2019s primary care provider. If football clubs feel the need to\nemploy a general practitioner to supply primary medical care,\nthis care should be supplied in a confidential setting. The two\nroles are different and no attempts should be made to merge\nthem.\nP Bundred\nDepartment of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, Whelan\nBuilding 2nd Floor, Quadrangle, Brownlow Hill, Liverpool L69 3GB,\nUK; peterb@liv.ac.uk\nEDUCATION PROGRAMME...........................................................................\nBritish Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine in association with the National Sports\nMedicine Institute\nEducation programme 2002\nGeneral Sports Medicine\nLilleshall National Sports Centre, 21\u201326 April.\nDiploma Preparation\nSheffield Centre of Sports Medicine, April\u2013May.\nCurrent Concepts: Lower Limb Rehabilitation\nDSMRC Headley Court, Surrey, 10\u201311 May .\nIntermediate Sports Injury Management and Medicine\u2014Lumbar\nSpine, Thorax, Groin, Pelvis, & Hip\nLilleshall National Sports Centre, 7\u201312 July .\nGeneral Sports Medicine\nLilleshall National Sports Centre, 22\u201327 September.\nPractical Sport and Medicine Meeting\nClub La Santa, Lanzarote (families & non-delegates welcome;\ndeadline 17 July, 2002), 3\u201310 October.\nDiploma Preparation\nLocation and date to be confirmed, October.\nThe Queen\u2019s Golden Jubilee & Post Commonwealth Games BASEM\nCongress\nThe Low Wood Hotel and Conference Centre, Windermere,\n10\u201313 October.\nIntermediate Sports Injury Management and Medicine\u2014Lower Limb\nLilleshall National Sports Centre, 17\u201322 November.\nCurrent Concepts\nTopic, location, and date to be confirmed, December.\nEducation programme 2003\nIntermediate Sports Injury Management and Medicine\u2014Head, Neck,\nand Upper Limb\nLilleshall National Sports Centre, 16\u201321 February.\nGeneral Sports Medicine\nLilleshall National Sports Centre, 27 April\u20132 May.\nFor further details of these courses please contact Mr Barry Hill, The\nNational Sports Medicine Institute, 32 Devonshire Street, London\nW1G 6PX, UK.
