Unfortunately, the \nmeasurement of pH in unbuffered, low ionic strength solutions, \nsuch as wet deposition, is prone to a variety of experimental \ndifficulties which can compromise the validity of the data. \nConsequently, it is essential that all investigators use \nmeasurement procedures that are consistent and reproducible. \nThis document provides recommendations on all aspects of the \nanalytical process, including collection, handling and analysis \nof acid rain samples, to assure the quality and comparability \nof the resulting pH data. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe pH of wet deposition, atmospheric precipitation, or, commonly, \"acid rain\" \n(which includes rainwater, snow, dew, sleet and hail), has become an \nenvironmental problem of international proportions. Extensive efforts are \ncontinuing to determine the extent of the problem and to ascertain spatial and \ntemporal trends. To achieve these goals, international networks have been \nestablished to monitor and record accurately the composition of rainfall. \nUnfortunately, discrepancies in data often occur due to differences in \ninstrumentation and analytical methodologies. These discrepancies limit the \nconclusions that can be drawn from these data. This is especially true of \nhistorical data sets which do not include sufficient documentation on the \nmethods, accuracy, precision and quality assurance procedures to ascertain the \nvalidity of the data. \nTo this end, the purpose of this document is to provide a set of recommended \nprocedures for the collection, handling and analysis of acid rain samples and \nfor assuring the quality of the resulting pH data. The conscientious use of \nthese procedures should result in greater comparability between laboratories \nand, consequently, improved reliability in data interpretation. As noted in the \ndiscussions below, there is still some disagreement among experts on some of \nthe procedures listed. Accordingly, the recommended procedures represent the \nbest compromise consistent with the current knowledge in this area. \nFurthermore, depending on the monitoring objectives, the frequency of \nsampling will vary. For example, weekly sampling may be appropriate for long- \nterm trend evaluation, whereas sequential sampling within a single wet \ndeposition event may be necessary to obtain information on scavenging \nprocesses. \n650 \nElectrometric determination of pH of atmospheric wet deposition 651 \nThe concept of pH, definition of pH scales, assignment of standard reference \nvalues, operational measurement, and recommended terminology have been \ndiscussed in detail in a previous IUPAC recommendation [ l ] .  The present \ndocument differs only in describing the unique considerations relevant to pH \nmeasurements in unbuffered, very low ionic strength (51 0-4 mol\/L) solutions \nsuch as atmospheric wet deposition and boiler feed waters. Measurements of \npH in these systems has been the subject of numerous research and review \narticles [2-111, and the purpose ,of this document is to bring together the best \napproaches, irrespective of national predilections. The most serious error in \nthe measurement is associated with the residual liquid junction potential \nwhich includes an intrinsic bias term resulting from the operational definition \nof pH and an additional bias error associated with the method of construction \nand history of the liquid junction. By performing measurements on a quality \ncontrol standard of dilute acid, a correction can be made to approximately \ncompensate for these bias terms. \nSUMMARY OF THE METHOD \nThe pH measurement system (pH\/millivolt meter and associated electrodes) is \ncalibrated with two reference buffer solutions that approximately bracket the \nanticipated sample pH range. The pH of the wet deposition sample is \ndetermined from this calibration and a quality control standard. The quality \ncontrol standard is necessary in this application to evaluate the residual liquid \njunction potential bias and to correct for this bias. In addition, a test \nprocedure is given to verify the proper functioning of the electrodes for \nmeasurement in dilute, unbuffered solutions. This procedure is capable of \nproviding measurements of pH with an absolute accuracy of f0.03 and a \nprecision of k0.02. \nSIGNIFICANCE OF THE PH MEASUREMENT AND ITS U S E  \nThe accurate measurement of pH in atmospheric wet deposition is an essential \nand critically important component in the monitoring of atmospheric wet \ndeposition for trends in the acidity and overall air quality. However, special \nprecautions, as detailed in this method, are necessary to ensure accurate pH \nmeasurements in low ionic strength, unbuffered solutions. Emphasis must be \nplaced on the reference electrode and minimizing the effect of the residual \nliquid junction potential bias. \nThis method is strictly applicable only to the measurement of pH in \natmospheric wet deposition. Its use in other applications may result in \ni n acc u rac ies . \nINTERFERENCES \nThe pH meter and the associated electrodes reliably measure pH in nearly all \naqueous solutions and are generally not subject to solution interferences from \ncolor, turbidity, oxidants, or reductants. \nThe electromotive force between the glass and the reference electrodes is a \nfunction of temperature as well as pH of the solution. If measurements cannot \nbe performed under constant-temperature conditions, e.g., in the field, \ntemperature effects can be approximately compensated for automatically or \nmanually depending on the type of pH meter used. \n652 COMMISSIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL AND ELECTROCHEMISTRY \nAlthough usually not a serious problem with acid rain samples, organic \nmaterials dispersed in water may foul the glass electrode surface, particularly \nwhen analyzing low ionic strength solutions. Difficulty encountered in \nstandardizing the electrodes, erratic readings, or excessive response times \nmay be an indication of contamination of the glass bulb or the liquid junction \nof the reference electrode. \nThe residual liquid junction potential can lead to very large errors in the \nmeasurement of low ionic strength samples. This error occurs when the \njunction potential of the sample differs from that of the standards. These \nconditions frequently occur in wet deposition analyses when the electrodes are \ncalibrated with conventional standard reference buffers of moderate ionic \nstrength. Other factors which influence the liquid junction potential are the \njunction configurations (free flowing vs. constrained), electrolyte leak rate, \njunction resistance, and flow-rate or \u201cstreaming\u201d effects caused by solution \nflow past the electrodes [12]. \nTo speed electrode equilibration, the sample should be agitated prior to taking \na pH reading. Care must be taken, however, to avoid an error that can occur \nbetween stirred and unstirred wet deposition samples. It is recommended that \nthis error be eliminated by agitating all calibration, quality control, and wet \ndeposition solutions thoroughly to speed electrode equilibration and then \nallowing each solution to become quiescent before taking a pH reading. If \nmagnetic stirring is used, take care not to contaminate the sample when \ninserting the stirring bar. Provide insulation or maintain an air space between \nthe surface of the stirring motor and the sample container to prevent heating \nof the test solution. \nAPPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT \nPH Meter -- The meter may have either an analog or digital display with a pH \nreadability of at least 0.01. A meter that has separate calibration and slope \nadjustment features and is electrically shielded to avoid interferences from \nstray currents or static charge is necessary. It may be battery or AC line \npowered; if battery powered, the meter must have a battery check feature. A \ntemperature compensator control for measurements at temperatures other than \n25 \u201cC is desirable. \npH Electrode -- Select a general purpose glass electrode which has a useful pH \nrange of 2-1 1. This electrode should be used exclusively fqr atmospheric wet \ndeposition measurements. \nReference Electrode --  The preferred reference electrode for wet deposition \nanalysis is one equipped with a free-diffusion junction with cylindrical \nsymmetry but, for the pragmatic reasons of availability and ease of operation, \nquartz-fiber and ceramic-frit junction electrodes are also recommended \nprovided they meet the acceptance testing criteria (minimum performance \ncharacteristics) given below. Mercury\/calomel and Ag\/AgCI internal reference \nelements are satisfactory for these applications, although the calomel \nreference electrode is more prone to temperature hysteresis effects and care \nshould be taken to avoid the formation of insoluble chlorides in the frit when \nused in dilute solutions [12]. This electrode should also be used exclusively for \natmospheric wet deposition measurements. \nElectrometric determination of pH of atmospheric wet deposition 653 \nCombination pH\/Reference Electrode --  The combination electrode combines \nthe indicating and reference elements in a single unit. A ceramic reference \njunction is recommended as noted above. Since sample volume requirements are \noften a consideration when analyzing limited-volume wet deposition samples, \ncombination electrodes are more convenient than separate glass and reference \nelectrodes. This electrode should be used exclusively for atmospheric wet \ndeposition measurements. \nTemperature Control -- Use either a constant temperature water bath, a \ntemperature compensator, or a thermometer to verify that all standards and \nsamples are maintained at temperatures within +2 \"C  of one another. \nStirrer (optional) -- This device may be electric, water- or air-driven. If an \nelectric stirrer is selected, leave an air gap or place an insulating pad between \nthe stirrer surface and the solution container to minimize heating of the \nsample. Use a thoroughly cleaned fluorocarbon-coated stirring bar. \nAlternatively, solutions may be manually stirred or swirled to enhance the rate \nof equilibration. \nElectrode Storage -- When not in use, electrodes should be stored in a solution \nwhich maintains conditioning. It is recommended that glass electrodes be \nstored in a dilute acid or dilute buffer solution such as 10-4 M hydrochloric \nacid (ca. pH 4.00) or a 1:lOO dilution of the pH 4.00 phthalate buffer. For \nceramic-frit reference electrodes and combination electrodes storage in a KCI \nsolution (23.5 mol\/L and <saturated) containing ca. 5% of the diluted phthalate \nbuffer (or dilute HCI) is recommended to maintain conditioning of the glass, to \nprevent the formation of a salt concentration gradient in the frit and to \nminimize the precipitation of calomel or silver chloride .in the liquid junction \npores [12]. Reference electrodes with free diffusion liquid junctions may be \nstored in more dilute KCI, e.g., 0.1 mol\/L, since the junction is flushed prior to \nuse. \nREAGENTS AND MATERIALS \nPurity of Reagents --  Use reagent grade chemicals for all solutions. \nPurity of Water -- Use water conforming to ASTM Specification D 1193, Type II \n[13], or equivalent. Filters (0.2 micrometer) are recommended for all faucets \nsupplying ASTM Type II water to prevent the introduction of bacteria and\/or ion \nexchange resins into reagents, standard solutions, and internally formulated \nquality control check solutions. \nBuffer Solutions --  IUPAC phthalate reference value standard and I :1 phosphate \nprimary standard [ l ]  or their commercially available equivalents must be used \nfor calibration. These buffer solutions have nominal pH values of 4 and 7, the \nexact pH for the measurement temperature being provided by IUPAC [ l ]  or by \nthe supplier of the specific buffer. Store the reference buffer solutions in \npolyethylene or chemical-resistant glass bottles and replace after one year or \nsooner if a visible change such as the development of colloidal or particulate \nmaterials is observed. \n654 COMMISSIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL AND ELECTROCHEMISTRY \nQuality Control Sample (QCS) -- Quality control samples may be prepared by \ndilutions of stock volumetric acids with water. \nSolutions of strong acids containing 0.1 to 1.0 mol\/L, intended as \nvolumetric standards and certified to kO.1 Yo, are commercially available. \nThey may be diluted to provide a 10 -4  mol H+\/L solution using \ngravimetrically calibrated pipettes and volumetric flasks. The pH of these \nsolutions has been found not to be affected by the trace quantities of \npreservative (usually HgC12) which the volumetric acids sometimes contain. \nThe final solution should be accurate to +0.2%, with a pH specified to \nf0.005. The pH of these solutions is 4.005 for 10-4 mol\/L HCI or HNO3 and \n4.006 for 5 x 10-5 mol\/L H2SO4,  assuming the solution is in equilibrium \nwith atmospheric C02 .  The pH with respect to the calibration buffers is \nhigher than paH+ according to the value of the residual liquid junction \npotential. Recent measurements under idealized conditions [8,14,15] \nindicate that the true pH is 4.035 rtr 0.01. Although measured at 20 \"C, this \nvalue should be good for the range from 10 to 30 \"C. \nOther dilutions of acid may be made to prepare solutions in the pH range of \n4 to 5.  The paH+ of these solutions can be calculated from a knowledge of \nactivity coefficients and the solubility of C 0 2 ,  but the pH, referred to \nstandard buffer solutions, must be determined empirically, as consensus \nvalues have not yet emerged. As the pH approaches 5, its precise value \nbecomes more sensitive to the partial pressure of CO2, thereby reducing the \nreliability of the solution as a QCS. \nThe solutions should be stored at room temperature in a high-density \npolyethylene (HDPE) or polypropylene (HDPP) container. Various factors \nmay affect the stability of these solutions which, due to their extreme \ndilution, have poor buffer capacities. The pH of the chosen quality control \nsample should be verified against the phthalate reference value standard on \na daily basis. \nAlternatively, quality control samples of verified pH in an atmospheric wet \ndeposition matrix are available from the U.S. National Institute of Standards \nand Technology as Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2694, \"Simulated \nRainwater\" [ I  0,161. \nSAMPLE COLLECTION, PRESERVATION AND STORAGE \nAlthough darkened, borosilicate glass bottles have been recommended for the \ncollection and storage of natural freshwater to prevent photosynthesis and gas \nexchange [5], rainwater normally contains minimal microbial populations and \nthe low pH (15) precludes significant C 0 2  effects. Consequently, it is \nrecommended that wet deposition samples be collected in high-density \npolyethylene containers that have been thoroughly rinsed with distilled water. \nDo not use strong mineral acids or alkaline detergent solutions for cleaning \ncollection vessels. Residual acids may remain in the polyethylene matrix and \nslowly leach back into the sample. Alkaline detergents may also leave residues \nthat may affect the sample chemistry. Cap collection bottles after cleaning to \nprevent contamination from airborne contaminants; air dry collection buckets \nin a laminar-flow clean, air workstation (if available) and wrap in polyethylene \nbags prior to use. If a laminar flow workstation is not available, pour out any \nElectrometric determination of pH of atmospheric wet deposition 655 \nresidual rinse water and bag the buckets immediately. \ninterior by any method other than air drying in a clean air workstation. \nDo not dry the bucket \nThe frequency of sample collection and the choice of sampler design are \ndependent on the monitoring objectives. In general, the use of wet-only \nsamplers is recommended to exclude dry deposition contributions, minimize \nsample contamination, retard evaporation, and enhance sample stability. \nSample collection frequency may vary from subevent to monthly sampling \nperiods. However, collection periods of more than one week are not \nrecommended since sample integrity may be compromised by longer exposure \nperiods. For detailed siting and sample collection recommendations, refer to: \n\"Analysis of Wet Deposition (Acid Rain): Determination of the Major Anionic \nConstituents by Ion Chromatography\" [17]. \nThe dissolution of particulate materials and the presence of microbial activity \nwill affect the activity of hydrogen ions (pH) in wet deposition samples [5,18]. \nThis source of error becomes more significant as the sample acquisition time \nincreases. Samples which can not be analyzed immediately after collection \nshould be refrigerated at 4 \"C. This will minimize, but not prevent, changes in \nthe hydrogen ion content. \nFor samples collected over longer periods or where particulate contamination \nis a problem, filtration of samples through a water-leached 0.45 micrometer \nmembrane is effective at stabilizing pH values that are influenced by the \ndissolution of alkaline particulate matter [19]. \nCALIBRATION \nTurn on the pH meter and allow it to stabilize according to the manufacturer's \ninstruct ions. \nIf necessary, add filling solution to the reference electrode before using. \nMaintain the filling solution level at least 2 cm above the level of the sample \nsurface to ensure an adequate flow of electrolyte through the constrained \nliquid junction. For a free-diffusion junction, before contacting the sample \nsolution, flush the junction with the salt bridge electrolyte to provide a fresh \nliquid junction interface with the sample solution. \nBring the nominal pH 4 and 7 buffers, the QCS solution, and all wet deposition \nsamples to the same temperature, to within 2 \"C. \nCaution: Take extreme care to avoid cross contamination, i.e., carryover, of the \nsolutions. \nCalibration Function: \na) Rinse the electrodes with three aliquots of distilled water or with a \nflowing stream from a wash bottle. Dispense two aliquots of the buffer \nwith the higher pH (i.e., pH = 7) into separate, clean sample cups. Insert the \nelectrodes into one aliquot with agitation for 30 seconds. \nb) Remove the electrodes from the first aliquot and insert directly into \nthe second. Allow sufficient time for the pH reading to stabilize within \nkO.01 for 30 seconds. \nc) Adjust the calibration control until the reading corresponds to the \ntemperature-corrected value of the reference buffer solution. \n656 COMMISSIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL AND ELECTROCHEMISTRY \nSlope Function: \na) Rinse the electrodes with three aliquots of distilled water or with a \nflowing stream from a wash bottle. Dispense two aliquots of the second \nreference buffer solution into separate, clean sample cups. Insert the \nelectrodes into one aliquot with agitation for 30 seconds. \nb) Remove the electrodes from the first aliquot and insert directly into \nthe second. Allow the system to equilibrate as directed above. \nc)  Adjust the slope function until the reading corresponds to the \ntemperature corrected value of the reference buffer solution. The slope \nfunction should be between 98% and 102% of the theoretical Nernstian \nresponse. \nNote - Some of the possible causes for deviation from Nernstian response \ni ) improper calibration procedure, \ni i )  old, contaminated or improperly prepared buffer solutions, \ni i i )  insufficient rinsing of the electrodes between solutions, \ni v )  fouled reference junction, \nv )  defective electrode(s), \nv i )  defective meter. \ninclude [12]: \nIt may be necessary to replace one or both of the electrodes if the non- \nNernstian behavior persists even with accurately and freshly prepared \nbuffer standards. \nCalibration Check: \nRemove the electrodes from the second buffer, rinse thoroughly, and place \ninto the first reference buffer solution. If the pH does not read within \nfO.O1 of the temperature-corrected value, repeat the calibration procedure \nuntil the buffer readings agree. \nQUALITY CONTROL \nIt is recommended that electrodes used for the measurement of wet deposition \nsamples should not be used for other sample types. Strongly acidic or basic \nsolutions may cause electrode contamination or degradation and result in \nbiased measurements and\/or slow response in wet precipitation samples. \nSimilarly, samples containing high concentrations of organic matter may leave \na residue on the pH glass membrane surface resulting in slow electrode \nresponse. \nIndividual laboratory quality control practices should establish the limits of \nacceptable bias and establish the conditions under which the correction for \nbias need not be applied. It is recommended that the data obtained from the \nQCS checks be plotted on a co,ntrol chart for routine assessment of bias and \nprecision. \nQCS measurements should be made after every ten samples or after completion \nof a batch of samples consisting of less than ten. If the measured pH of the \nQCS has changed by more than 0.03, reanalyze all samples since the last QCS \ncheck. \nHectrometric determination of pH of atmospheric wet deposition 657 \nv E R IF IC ATI ON o F E L ECTR o D E P E R F o R M AN c E \nAfter the meter and electrodes have been calibrated, measure the pH of the \nquality control sample (QCS). This sample of dilute HNO3 (see Reagents \nSection above) should be freshly prepared each day. Verify the pH of the QCS by \ndirect comparison with the phthalate reference buffer solution. The difference \nbetween the measured pH of the QCS and reference value constitutes the bias \nof the pH measurement system. All measured values of the pH of subsequent \nwet deposition samples should be corrected for this bias by subtracting this \ndifference from the measured value. If the pH bias exceeds 0.1, the electrodes \nare not acceptable for wet deposition measurements and should be replaced. \nIn addition, the pH readings should be relatively independent of solution \nstirring effects. If a pH shift of more than 0.02 is observed between a stirred \nand quiescent dilute acid solution, it is likely due to a malfunction of the \nreference electrode. If, after attempted rejuvenation (refill with fresh KCI \nsolution and soak the junction for several hours in concentrated KCI), the \nelectrode still exhibits an excessive pH shift upon stirring, the reference \nelectrode should be discarded. \nMEASUREMENT PROCEDURE \nBring all solutions to the same temperature (+2 \"C). \nCalibrate the electrode assembly with two reference buffer solutions as \ndescribed above. \nAfter the electrodes and meter are calibrated, determine the bias by analyzing \na QCS sample using the same procedure as given below for rainwater samples. \nSample Analysis: \na) Rinse the electrodes with three aliquots of water or with a flowing \nstream from a wash bottle. Dispense two aliquots of atmospheric wet \ndeposition sample into separate, clean sample cups. Insert the electrodes \ninto one aliquot and agitate for 30 seconds to condition the electrodes. \nb) Remove the electrodes from the first aliquot and insert directly into \nthe second, once again agitating for 30 seconds, then allowing the solution \nto become quiescent (approximately 30 seconds) and the pH reading to \nstabilize. The pH electrode response time is typically three to five minutes \nfor acid rain samples. Record the pH measurement when readings differ by \nno more than kO.01 within a 30 second period. Record the pH and the \ntemperature of the sample. Correct for the bias and report the corrected \nvalue as the pH of the wet deposition sample. \nSUMMARY \nThe measurement of pH in low ionic strength, unbuffered solutions such as \natmospheric wet deposition is prone to a variety of experimental difficulties \nwhich can compromise the validity of the data. However, if the procedures \ndiscussed above are concientiously followed, the reliability of the data \nacquired will be considerably increased permitting valid intercomparisons of \nresults. \n658 COMMISSIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL AND ELECTROCHEMISTRY \nREFERENCES \n1.
