Nevertheless, IP evidently is only a relatively minor interest to Posner. He has \npublished merely 20 or so substantial papers on it, about half of which were written \nwith Landes (pp 3-4), whereas his total output now runs to about 300 books and \nsubstantial papers, written at a rate of almost 10 a year since 1969, and during this \ntime he has also written some 150 other pieces and served as an appeal court judge. In \nThe Economic Structure of Intellectual Property Law, L&P have now brought \ntogether and reworked many of their papers on IP (p 425) to give the most extensive \ncommentary upon it from the \u2018Posnerian\u2019 law and economics perspective. With the \nstriking exception of a sustained treatment of the unusual remedies extended to the \nprotection of IP (p 7), most of the issues raised by IP are somewhere discussed in the \npapers now combined in this book, and a, to some extent new, framework for this \ndiscussion is given at the beginning of the book. The gist of L&P\u2019s position is that, \nthough they to some extent agree with the widely-held belief that copyright holders in \nparticular (chs 2-3), but also patent holders to a lesser extent (pp 310-26), now enjoy \nexcessive rights (p 9), they generally approve of intellectual property: \u2018We do ?  find \npretty solid economic support for a degree of trade secrecy protection close to what \nwe have and for a degree of copyright and patent protection as well, but possibly a \nlesser degree than we have\u2019 (p 9). \n In this review we will argue that L&P\u2019s defence of intellectual property is not \nreconcilable with the stance they have elsewhere taken towards government \nintervention. IP rights are government interventions in market allocations, and their \njustification is in terms of optimising the social welfare function. As such they should \nbe subject to many of the criticisms L&P have levelled at other interventions, but they \nare not. Reflection on this paradox leads to interesting insights into the nature of \nPosnerian \u2018efficiency\u2019 and \u2018welfare maximisation\u2019. More broadly, it once again \nillustrates the way in which Posnerian law and economics is an interaction of \nmutually reinforcing economic and legal formalisms (Campbell and Picciotto 1998). \nA truly critical approach to both the law and the economics of IP could contribute to a \nfundamental re-evaluation of the social consequences of IP law, especially as it has \ndeveloped in the recent past, and to some radical proposals for change. But L&P \nmerely apply a hackneyed formula to yet another body of law, and so provide no more \nthan a few ideas for tinkering with details of IP; despite being, as we will see, \nconscious that the entire edifice rests on the weakest of foundations. \n \n 2 \nL&P\u2019S ARGUMENT FOR IP \nAs the title of their book, and, of course, the nature of their entire work, leads one to \nexpect, L&P\u2019s account of IP law is economic. Quickly dismissing \u2018Other perspectives \n\u2026  besides the economic\u2019 (p 4), L&P put forward \u2018an analysis and evaluation of \nintellectual property law ?  conducted within an economic framework that seeks to \nalign that law with the dictates of economic efficiency\u2019 (p 4). As with their earlier \nwork on eg tort law (p 10, cf Landes and Posner 1987), L&P\u2019s aim is to cut through \nthe complexities of the legal doctrines to enhance understanding of the \u2018economic \nstructure\u2019 of IP, revealing the \u2018deep commonality, as well as significant differences, \namong the various fields of intellectual property law, and between intellectual \nproperty law and the law governing physical property\u2019 (p10). \n But whereas L&P are confident that their work on tort does show a \u2018generally \nefficient\u2019 \u2018unity\u2019 to the law it studies, they concede from the start that IP does not \nhave such a unity, and consequently there is a \u2018degree to which economic analysis of \nintellectual property remains inconclusive, if not indeterminate\u2019 (p10). Consequently, \nin order to bring such unity and structure to the field as is possible, they promise a \nnovel departure from the standard economic argument for IP. That argument is, of \ncourse, that the state is required to grant IP \u2018monopolies\u2019 because, in their absence, \nthe \u2018intangible\u2019 nature of IP makes it difficult to exclude non-paying use, and without \nthe ability to charge for use, there will be insufficient incentive to innovate, so the rate \nof innovation will be too low. We will call this the \u2018innovation argument\u2019. L&P, \nhowever, tell us that: \nIt may come as a surprise to many readers that the economic arguments \nwe make for intellectual property protection are not based primarily on a \nbelief that without legal protection the incentives to create such property \nwould be inadequate. That belief cannot be defended confidently on the \nbasis of current knowledge. The concerns we highlight have rather to do \nwith such things as optimal management of existing stocks of intellectual \nproperty, congestion externalities, search costs, rent-seeking, and \ntransaction costs (pp 9-10). \n Throughout their book, L&P do indeed highlight subsidiary aspects of the case \nfor IP. The patent, for example, is defended on the basis that, in its absence, \u2018investors \nwould invest many more resources in maintaining trade secrecy (and competitors in \nunmasking them) and inventive activity would be inefficiently biased toward \ninventions that can kept secret\u2019 (p 328). \u2018Moral rights\u2019 (in their US form at least) are \ncriticised because \u2018much of what they seek to prevent is already forbidden, often by \ncriminal as well as civil law\u2019 (p 276), and the mischiefs they alone seek to address are \n\u2018too rare to justify the creation and maintenance of a complex body of law (with \nundesirable side-effects) designed to prevent them arising\u2019 (p 280). One could go on \nfor this book does make provocative comments about many of the current lively \npolicy issues within IP law. In particular, its remarks on \u2018congestion effects\u2019 (pp 222-\n8) are, we believe, an unarguably interesting contribution. \n But when it comes to the basic issue raised by IP law, which is whether it is \njustified at all, L&P are committed to the innovation argument. This is the core of \n\u2018The Economic Theory of Property\u2019 set out in Chapter 1, and recapitulated at points \nthroughout the book. Their basic account is so conventional that it does not seem \nworthwhile to set it out in full, and, in truth, there does not seem to be much substance \nto their claim to be stating a novel economic argument for IP. Instead, they place \nequivocation about the innovation theory at the heart of their account of that theory. \n 3 \nL&P repeatedly tell us that IP rights have \u2018social costs\u2019 (p 172), that the argument for \nthe necessity of IP rights for innovation to take place is \u2018easily exaggerated\u2019 (p 53), \nthat it would be a mistake to take the growth in the use of IP rights to be \u2018a reliable \nproxy for technological advance\u2019 (p 352), etc; and, in sum, they emphasise a \u2018cost-\nbenefit tradeoff\u2019 (p 21) \u2018between \u201cincentive\u201d and \u201caccess\u201d\u2019 (p 11) in their statement of \nthe innovation theory. \n But, although the preposterous partiality of much pleading in IP cases, and of \nmost public debate when yet greater rights are sought, would hardly lead one to \nrealise it, the interesting literature on IP is already dominated by the realisation that \nthe curtailing of IP rights by fair use exceptions, limitations of time and extent, de \nfacto permission for wholesale violation, etc is essential to maintain any plausibility \nin the argument that granting those rights enhances welfare. L&P are merely placing \nthese limitations at the heart of their account of the innovation argument. By focusing \non partial aspects of the innovation argument and by registering all sorts of caveats \nabout it, it appears that L&P are taking a distance from that argument, but, with \nrespect, they are merely stating the argument in a less than scrupulous manner. They \ndo not defend that argument outright, but they do basically maintain it, and actually \nshield it from criticism by treating the counter-evidence as caveats which leave the \nbasic argument intact. \n All this is an instance of the \u2018exception barring\u2019 which Lakatos (1978, ch 1) has \ntold us is used to excess in the defence of degenerate research programmes. L&P \nplausibly argue that the passage of the US Copyright Act in 1976 marks a step change \nin the long history of IP, and we are now in period of unprecedented, tremendous \ngrowth in IP rights (pp 2-3, 403-4, 406-7). Of this they say: \u2018Whether the increases in \nthe legal protection of intellectual property since 1976 have conferred net benefits on \nthe US economy is uncertain\u2019 (p 416). Now, whilst arguments of this exception \nbarring sort are hardly unknown in Posner\u2019s previous work (Campbell and Picciotto, \n1998, pp 255-6), this is strikingly theoretically unscrupulous. For anyone who \nbelieves that government intervention should be eschewed unless it can reliably be \nshown to have net social benefits, being uncertain about the net benefits of IP should \nlead to nothing less than a call for its repeal, but L&P treat it as merely a qualification \nof their basically approving stance. They conclude that \u2018definitive recommendations \nfor fundamental change [to the existing law of IP] cannot be supported on the basis of \nexisting knowledge\u2019 (p 10), which is a marked, and markedly curious, reversal of \nPosner\u2019s normal stance towards bodies of the law which cannot be shown to be \nefficient. \n Another consideration makes it even more difficult to see why L&P would \ndisplay this commitment to the innovation argument. Very commonly the IP rights \nthey are defending when they accept the innovation argument are regarded as \nmonopolies, and as such, one would have thought, anathema to the \u2018pro-market\u2019 \nstance of Posnerian law and economics. It is to the resolution of this paradox that this \nreview now turns. \n  \nIP AND ANTITRUST \nIt can hardly be denied that \u2018Many important antitrust cases have involved intellectual \nproperty\u2019 (p 372), and indeed there now is a very considerable body of law in which \n\u2018the rights of owners of intellectual property have been shaped (mostly limited) to a \ngreat degree by antitrust law\u2019 (p 372). Important parts of this body of law are \nreviewed in Chapter 14, in the course of which L&P\u2019s view of the relationship of IP \nand antitrust emerges. This attitude is very sympathetic indeed to the IP side of this \n 4 \nrelationship. It will not do to attack IP protection simply by exploiting the \u2018persuasive \ndefinition\u2019 (Stevenson 1938) of IP rights as monopolies, trusting to the pejorative \nconnotation of \u2018monopoly\u2019 to prejudice the evaluation of those rights. (One might, \nhowever, feel that those proselytisers of IP who so commonly use \u2018piracy\u2019 and similar \nterms intending to benefit from the opposite connotation can hardly complain about \nthis). However, when L&P argue that it is \u2018a mistake\u2019 \u2018to suppose that there is an \ninherent tension between intellectual property law, because it confers \u201cmonopolies\u201d, \nand antitrust law\u2019 (p 374), they are purporting to make rather more than this good \npoint. \n L&P sometimes even seem to go so far as to say that IP rights can never \nproductively be described as monopolies at all: \u2018Talk of patent and copyright \n\u201cmonopolies\u201d is conventional ?  This usage is harmless as long as it is understood to \nbe different from how the same word is used in antitrust analysis\u2019 (p 374). The IP \nright merely creates private property in intangible goods just as, say, land law creates \nit in tangible goods: \nOne does not say that the owner has a parcel of land has a monopoly \nbecause he has the right to exclude others from using this land. But a \npatent or a copyright is a monopoly in the same sense. It excludes other \npeople from using some piece of intellectual property without consent. \nThat in itself has no antitrust significance (p 374). \n This is right in itself, but it is very partial, for one would have thought that, \nthough they both create private property, it could not be denied that IP rights are \ncreated in a very different way to rights in land. But this is just what L&P do deny.2 In \nwhat in our opinion remains the most penetrating exposition and evaluation of the \ninnovation argument, Plant (1974, pt 2; see further Picciotto and Campbell 2003, pp \n284-91) argued as long ago as 1934-5 that, as L&P have it, \u2018intellectual property \nrights create scarcity whereas property rights in physical goods manage scarcity\u2019 (p \n20). Although they initially seem to accept this point made by \u2018the invaluable Plant\u2019 \n(p 8), they ultimately reject it, claiming that:  \n[Plant\u2019s] point is incomplete. Unless there is a power to exclude, the \nincentive to create intellectual property in the first place may be impaired. \nSocially desirable investments ?  may be deterred if the creators of \nintellectual property cannot recoup their sunk costs ?  charging a price for \nan [IP right] reduces access to it (a social cost), making it artificially \nscarce (Plant\u2019s point), but increases the incentive to create it in the first \nplace, which is a possibly offsetting social benefit ?  Arnold Plant was \nmistaken to think that rights in physical property alleviate scarcity and \nrights in intellectual property create it ?  Information is a scarce good, \njust like land. Both are commodified \u2013 that is, made excludable property \u2013 \nin order to create incentives to alleviate their scarcity (pp 20-1, 374). \n To the extent that L&P\u2019s argument may be taken to yield any overall sense, it is \nthat, as the creation of scarcity by means of IPs is necessary to give incentives to \ninnovate, Plant is wrong to say this is the creation of scarcity! The necessity L&P feel \nto accept the innovation argument leads them to deny the objectionable aspects of that \nargument which Plant had the intellectual honesty to look in the face.3 L&P\u2019s brief \nrejection of this important position in the analysis of IP is too slight to be taken \nseriously, but it is expressive of the extent of their sympathy to IP and, we will argue, \nthe unsatisfactory way they maintain it.  \n 5 \n L&P\u2019s other line, not readily reconcilable with the denial that IP rights can \nusefully be regarded as monopolies at all, is that, though they do tend to create \nmonopolies, this is not really a very serious problem: \u2018we do not mean to suggest that \nevery copyright and every patent should raise warning flags for antitrust enforcers. \nMost copyrights and patents do not confer enough market power to raise any kind of \nantitrust issue\u2019 (p 15 n 11). The most sustained exposition of the concept of market \npower in the book concludes that we normally should have \u2018no worry\u2019 (p 378) about \nIP in this respect \u2018because the vast majority of copyrights, patents, and other \nintellectual property rights confer no more monopoly power on the owner of the right \nthan owning the only barber shop within a five-block radius\u2019 (pp 378-9). Even had we \nthe space to do so, we would not wish to go through what L&P say of these monopoly \nproblems at any length, for the labour would not be repaid. We want only to convey \nthe nature of their attitude to these problems by quoting their treatment of them as \nthey are posed by the \u2018new economy\u2019 (p 390) based on information technology: \nThe features of the new economy \u2026  tug it toward monopoly yet, oddly, \nalso toward competition. The more protection from competition a firm \nthat succeeds in obtaining a monopoly will enjoy, the more competition \nthere will be to become that monopolist; and provided that the only \nfeasible or permitted means of obtaining the monopoly are socially \nproductive, this competition may be wholly desirable rather than a form of \nwasteful rent-seeking. A firm that will have the protection both of \nintellectual property law and of economies of scale in consumption if it is \nthe first to come up with an essential component of a new economy \nproduct or service will have a lucrative monopoly, and this product should \naccelerate the rate of innovation, just as, other things being equal, the \nmore valuable a hoard of buried treasure is, the more rapidly it will be \nrecovered (p 395).  \n Well, that\u2019s alright then. Similarly, \u2018provided that\u2019 Campbell\u2019s dog has feathers \ninstead of fur, then, \u2018other things being equal\u2019 (he also has a beak instead of a muzzle, \ntwo instead of four feet, etc), then he is a duck. But, leaving aside the homespun \ncomplaisance and absurdity of this passage (and its flat contradiction of the many \ntimes L&P criticise IP as an inducement to rent-seeking, eg p 220), what is so wrong \nwith this way of treating IP rights is that it obscures their essential nature as a public \nintervention. There certainly are varying degrees of market power, so that if one \ndefines a monopoly by effective market power beyond a certain threshold, there will \nbe interminable argument about whether IP in general or particular IP rights create a \nmonopoly. But the whole point of IP is to strengthen market power by government \nintervention. When the intervention unarguably purports to create sole rights of \nsupply with the purpose of enhancing market share, gives effect to these rights by \nstate imposition of criminal sanctions foreign to competitive business, or by state \nenforcement of unusually draconian civil sanctions, and when there may well also be \nextensive government subsidy of the industries which the intervention is intended to \nbenefit,4 it seems to us that it is but natural to call that intervention a monopoly; but \nwe do not want to die in a ditch over this. The most important thing is to recognise \nthat IP is an intervention, and to explore the consequences of this. \n \nIP AS AN INTERVENTION \nAn intervention can have only one justification: that the social welfare function is \nimproved by it, and this is, overall, what L&P believe to be the case with IP. They \n 6 \nhold that IP encourages \u2018socially desirable investments\u2019, which they define as \n\u2018investments that yield social benefits in excess of their social costs\u2019 (p 20). They \nproduce formal models of the welfare calculations necessary to show this for \ncopyright (ch 3), trademarks (pp 174-9), patents (pp 297-300), and trade secrets (p \n366), and apply this formal reasoning to subsidiary problems such as the optimal \nduration (ch 8) and extent (ch 5) of copyright. \n The crucial equation in all this modelling is the rather simple one that W = w \u2013 \ne(z), where W is net welfare, w is the total welfare provided by granting the IP right, \nand \u2018e(z) is the cost of creating the particular work and is a function of the scope of \nthe [IP] protection\u2019 (p 80). (e is the \u2018cost of expression\u2019 and z \u2018the level of [IP] \nprotection\u2019 (p 71)). As with all cost-benefit calculations, estimating cost in this case is \nlikely to be insuperably difficult but in principle possible. On the other hand, benefit \ncannot be estimated even in principle if that benefit is, as it is typically claimed to be, \nthe sum of the satisfactions enjoyed by citizens affected by the policy, for data is not \navailable about citizens\u2019 preferences regarding goods which, ex hypothesi, do not \nexist unless the decision is taken to intervene to produce them. (Cost-benefit analysis \ntypically refuses to regard the fact that goods do not exist as expressive of a \npreference that they should not exist). Hence, benefit estimates are supplied by the \nmodeller in the absence of preference data. In IP, the basic benefit is the accelerated \nrate of innovation which follows the grant of the IP right. \n L&P follow the overwhelming majority of the IP literature by thinking that they \ncan put realistic values into the algebra which allow them to determine, for example, \nwhether copyright should be extended to unpublished works (pp 131-41). We get the \nfollowing, entirely characteristic, priceless, result: \nAn author of unpublished materials is likely to object to their being \npublished because they reveal his disreputable or unethical behaviour. \nKnowing in advance that copyright protection for such materials was \nweak might induce him to behave better, thus raising social welfare ?  A \nrisk remains that knowledge of discreditable jottings were not protected \nby copyright would induce people to be more discreet in those jottings. \nSince the private cost of discretion is likely to be less than its social cost \nin concealing valuable clues to character, the reticence factor will reduce \nthe consumer surplus generated by biographies if unpublished materials \nare denied copyright protection (p 141). \nOn this basis of this airy speculation, models for gauging the welfare consequences of \nvarious extensions of copyright are put forward in formal, algebraic terms which the \nspeculation makes ridiculous (pp 131-41, 142-3). We imagine that many of those \ncritical of Posner reading this review will not be surprised at this, for purporting to put \nobjective numerical values on that what cannot be so valued is, of course, what \nPosnerian law and economics has long been about.5 \n When one puts cost-benefit estimates into practice as policy, one finds what \nappears so exact on the blackboard has to be turned into rather more rough and ready \nlaw, and, of course, the thrust of L&P\u2019s book is that the existing law of IP is capable \nof being improved upon. Posner has always expressed a pronounced preference for \nlitigation over legislation, but L&P are in fact broadly sympathetic to both the statute \nand the case law of IP. The most sustained criticism they make is of the US Visual \nArtists Rights Act 1990 and the miniscule litigation about moral rights which has \nfollowed it (ch 10), and even here the criticism of an unclear (p 286) statute which \n 7 \ndoes \u2018not benefit the group [it] is intended to protect\u2019 (p 287), and so has led to a \n\u2018paucity\u2019 (p 286) of questionable (pp 273-4) judgments, is muted. \n But statute and case-law of this quality have not always received gentle \ntreatment at Posner\u2019s hands. What strikes us about IP law, especially the court \njudgments, is just how inherently poor it is, with the contradictory necessity of \ncurtailing the rights granted leading to the continual drawing of indefensible \ndistinctions which themselves invite their own criticism. It is all highly reminiscent of \nwhat Posner has repeatedly said about the quality of antitrust law, the \u2018vague \nprovisions\u2019 (Posner 1976, p 7) of which generally articulate \u2018meaningless\u2019 (Posner \n1976, p 59) doctrines which lead only to \u2018confusion\u2019 (Posner 1979, p 929). Why does \nthe one intervention receive much gentler treatment at L&P\u2019s hands than Posner has \nbeen known to mete out to the other? \n \nIP AND THE MARKET \nL&P are well aware that the innovation argument is essentially the argument for the \ncreation of \u2018public goods\u2019: that the market would produce a sub-optimally low amount \nof these goods (pp 19-20), and that intervention is therefore required to produce a \nhigher optimal amount, in the case of IP, a higher optimal rate of innovation. It is on \nthis basis that, to take the famous example to which L&P themselves refer, that \nHotelling (1938) argued for public financing of certain large construction works. But \nL&P are anxious to stress that \u2018it is better to say that [a good produced under IP \nprotection] has public-good characteristics than that it is a public good\u2019 (p 225), for \nthe crucial difference is, of course, that IP is a system of public goods delivered gratis \ninto private hands: \nThe very term \u201cpublic good\u201d is misleading ?  It sounds like a good \nproduced by the government as opposed to the private sector. That is true \nof public goods that people cannot be excluded from having the benefit of \neven if they don\u2019t contribute to the cost of supplying the goods. The \nclearest example is national defence. Many public goods, however, \nincluding intellectual property, are excludable in the sense that it is not \npossible to condition access to them on payment. Such goods need not be \nprovided by the government (p 14).  \n Accepting, if only for the purposes of argument, L&P\u2019s distinction between \npublic goods, and the identification of IP as \u2018an excludable public good\u2019 (p 403 n 3), \nwe want to concentrate on the important consequence of that distinction. Posner in \nparticular has been known to be somewhat critical of the provision of public goods \nand the consequent necessity of regulation; indeed, the first paper he wrote, \u2018Natural \nMonopoly and Its Regulation\u2019 (Posner 1969), was an argument that \u2018we would be \nbetter off without trying to regulate natural monopolies\u2019 (Posner 1999, p vi). This \npaper has had an extraordinary impact, and arguably remains the best thing Posner has \nwritten. Public monopolies and public attempts to regulate private monopolies get a \npretty thorough drubbing in this paper; but in his subsequent work on IP, the public \nplacing of monopolies in private hands is looked upon, by contrast, very favourably, \nand the argument against regulation dropped. IP can, for example, readily be regarded \nas a way of regulating entry to a market, though the regulation seeks to narrow rather \nthan expand entry. The anxiety Posner displayed in \u2018Natural Monopoly and Its \nRegulation\u2019 to argue that \u2018Regulation of entry is unjustified and should be abandoned\u2019 \n(Posner 1999, p 82) is precisely what is abandoned in his work on IP. It seems that the \n 8 \nmonopoly which is deplored when the monopoly remains in public hands undergoes a \ndramatic transformation when the monopoly is granted to a private corporation. \n L&P seem to believe that the only alternative to the growth in IP since 1976 was \npublic ownership of these public goods, and of this they say: \nIf in 1976 there had been no patent system but instead a system of direct \ngovernment awards to successful inventors or direct government financing \nof R&D \u2026  if royalties in licenses of intellectual property had been fixed \nby government rather than by contract; if the publication of books had \nbeen a government monopoly; if the prices of books, drugs, and other \ngoods that embody intellectual property were fixed by a regulatory \nagency; if to minimise access costs intellectual property was given away \nfor free and its costs subsidised by the government \u2013 if any of these things \nhad been true, substitution of patent and copyright and trade secret and \ntrademark law, in short of intellectual property rights, would have been a \ngiant step in the right direction from the standpoint of economic efficiency \nand a major plank of the deregulation movement. But none of these things \nwas true. Intellectual property was already \u201cderegulated\u201d in favour of a \nproperty-rights system (pp 414-5). \nWell, again, all one can say is that\u2019s alright then. It is on the very next page that L&P \ntell us, as we have seen, that it \u2018is uncertain\u2019 whether IP since 1976 has \u2018conferred net \nbenefits\u2019 (p 416), but it is obvious that, so long as the monopoly revenues accrue to \nprivate hands, monopolies will be tolerated.  \n The range of alternatives which L&P contemplate in the above paragraph is \ncuriously limited. The provision of IP is, in their view, as in the view of the great \nmajority of those writing on the subject, a matter of either a private or public \nmonopoly. Posner and Landes are, indeed, in advance of much of the literature in \ngiving extended consideration to the latter. But surely it is puzzling that they, of all \nwriters, do not consider the alternative of market provision, for they do not think it \npossible that \u2018such property would be created in a free-market system\u2019 (p 376) (save \nfor trivial exceptions). In an entirely characteristic passage they say: \nIn the absence of intellectual property rights either the intellectual \nproperty will not be created or the government may have to finance it \nthrough a system of grants or rewards to writers and inventors. (We say \n\u201cmay\u201d, not \u201cwill\u201d, because there may be alternative sources of funding, \nsuch as private patronage.) (p 24). \n There are two errors which inform this passage. The first is to ignore the \npossibilities of alternative, competitive business models as the basis of innovation, \nalbeit ones which no doubt will lead to a typically lower rate of some kinds of \ninnovation than is produced by the stimulus of the grant of the IP monopoly. The \nsecond is to assume that, when innovation does not take place absent the IP \nmonopoly, this is always sub-optimal. But one does not have to be a Luddite to see \nthat the rate of innovation cannot be assumed to be invariably positively correlated to \nwelfare. One merely has to be other than fixated with growth of gdp to see this. What \nis more, the lower rate of innovation absent the IP intervention would be the rate \nproduced by the market, even if this meant that the good produced under IP was not \nproduced, and it is most curious to find L&P not giving any weight, indeed barely any \nrecognition, to the market\u2019s verdict that a good should not be produced because its \nproduction will not yield revenues in excess of the costs of its production.6 Normally, \n 9 \nwhen this is the case, (neo-)liberal economists conclude it is welfare optimising that \nthe good is not produced, and question interventions which seek to produce it as a \npublic good. But L&P clearly believe IP to be the acceptable face of intervention, and \nwe can put this down only to the fact that IP monopolies are conferred upon private \nparties, not upon public undertakings.  \n The most substantial defence of market allocation of the goods which now are \nallocated through IP rights is that of Plant which we have mentioned above. L&P \ndiscuss Plant in their general consideration of the issues in their \u2018Introduction\u2019 and in \nChapter 1, calling him \u2018The leading sceptic\u2019 about IP rights (p 21 n 18), and citing \nhim as authority for raising the question whether \u2018the high social costs of intellectual \nproperty rights create uncertainty as to whether on balance such rights are, from an \noverall social standpoint, cost-justified at all\u2019 (p 21). They purport to take from Plant \nthe argument that \u2018intellectual property protection might result in too much \nintellectual property being produced rather than too little (or perhaps both, for \ndifferent types of intellectual property)\u2019 (p 22), and repeatedly cite him when they \nargue that present arrangements are inefficient in that they lead to one or other of \nthese errors (e.g. p 374). But this is not what Plant means when he hazards the \npossibility that \u2018there may be too much invention\u2019 (Plant 1974, p 55). What Plant \nmeans is that there is no way of determining the optimal rate of innovation for an \neconomy, and therefore we cannot have confidence in claims to be able to maximise \nthe social welfare function by the intervention of creating or curtailing IP rights, \nregardless of whether the argument is that there is too little, just enough, or too much \nprotection, for the necessary quantities cannot be known. If one cannot know these \nthings, it is unwise to throw the great weight of state intervention backed by \ncompulsion behind a particular position which cannot be known to be right and \ncertainly will have costs and lead to rent-seeking. It is better to leave things to \ndecentralised, voluntary allocations through the market, which will be crowded out by \nIP monopolies (Merges 1994). \n L&P seem incapable of understanding Plant\u2019s argument, and they repeatedly \nnote aspects of it which should cause them to pause for thought, but, having noted, \nmove on. In a typical fashion, they also cite Hayek making very similar points (p \n415), but again do not stop to learn from Hayek by pursuing those points. Even more \nstrikingly, in the context of discussing the foundations of the theory of public goods, \nthey, seemingly approvingly, cite Coase\u2019s (1946) criticism of the concept of marginal \ncost that has played such a role in justifying intervention, which is that one cannot \nknow what marginal costs are for the purposes of marginal cost pricing (p 23). \nNevertheless, their entire book is an attempt to set an optimal level for the marginal \nrevenues of the holders of various IP rights. L&P are even prepared to acknowledge \nthat \u2018the empirical studies required\u2019 for proper identification of when it is necessary to \ngrant IP rights to avoid the rate of innovation being \u2018seriously suboptimal\u2019 are not \navailable and (if we read them aright) cannot be made available (p 24), but proceed \nregardless. In a throwaway line that one can hardly believe one is reading, they \njuxtapose the argument they take from Plant that the rate of innovation may be too \nhigh with an argument they take from Arrow (1985, ch 4) that (for reasons we need \nnot set out) it may be too low, and of this they say: \u2018Unfortunately, the weights of \nthese two offsetting factors are unknown\u2019 (p 304). In sum, L&P tell us that \u2018Economic \nanalysis has come up short of providing either theoretical or empirical grounds for \nassessing the overall effect of intellectual property law on economic welfare\u2019 (p 422). \nWe recall that L&P began their book by warning us that \u2018economic analysis of \nintellectual property remains inconclusive, if not indeterminate\u2019 (p 10). Now, whilst it \n 10 \ncertainly is the case that they intentionally and, even more, unintentionally show this \nto be so, one does have to wonder what they therefore think the justification of their \nbook can be. Their claim that what they show of IP law amounts to an \u2018economic \nstructure\u2019 is an unintended parody of \u2018structure\u2019, or \u2018IP\u2019, or both. \n In truth, behind the equivocations they repeatedly enter, L&P remain \nunthinkingly confident they that they can determine a social welfare function from \nwhich to judge the outcomes of IP intervention. It is important to stress that sort of \nintervention, rather than market allocation, is what Posnerian law and economics is all \nabout (Campbell 1994, pp 445-9).7 Wealth maximisation is a sort of welfare \neconomics, but a sort which has \u2018economic\u2019 \u2018efficiency\u2019, rather than any of the more \nleft-wing sounding goals normally identified with welfare economics, as its end. It has \nproven impossible to say what wealth maximisation is in any theoretically coherent \nway. There seems to be no point saying more than that it represents the growth of \nprivate accumulation. The goal of wealth maximisation is not a fully competitive \nmarket, in which costs as well as profits are internalised, but a state of private \naccumulation in which the law is efficient to the extent that it is used to maximise \nprivate accumulation, even if, as is certainly the case with regard to IP, this involves \nextensive intervention in the market (pp 36, 415). The profound resonance of Posner\u2019s \nwork lies in the fact that this is, of course, an empirically accurate description of the \nrole of the state in advanced capitalism, and the weakness of that work is that this is \ndefended not as the intervention it is, but as \u2018the market\u2019. \n All this harks back to the tortured interpretation of Pareto optimality that \nbrought Posner to such prominence a quarter of a century ago. What the book under \nreview contributes to the wealth maximisation literature is new evidence of just how \nmuch of a reformulation \u2018market\u2019, \u2018competition\u2019, etc undergo in Posnerian law and \neconomics: \nCasual talk about patent and copyright \u201cmonopolies\u201d \u2026  implicitly views \ncompetition as the state in which there are many firms competing to sell \nthe same product rather than as the state in which society\u2019s scarce \nresources are being exploited as efficiently as possible. From the latter \nstandpoint, which is more directly related to economic welfare, excluding \nothers from the use of property either physical or intellectual may be \nprocompetitive even if the result is a reduction in the number of \ncompetitors or a divergence from perfect competition \u2026  If making \nintellectual property excludable creates value, the efficient allocation of \nresources may be improved even if an economic and not merely a nominal \nlegal monopoly is created (p 379).  \nThe Posnerian touch8 is not that non-competitive outcomes are regarded as welfare \noptimising without any defence of how one would know this, for this is characteristic \nof the IP literature. It is that these outcomes are called competitive, when this is \nexactly what they are not. This passing off of \u2018intervention\u2019 as \u2018market\u2019 is the very \nessence of the Posnerian defence of \u2018economic efficiency\u2019. \n \nONE ALTERNATIVE TO IP: RIGHTS TO REMUNERATION \nThe major defect in the \u2018structure\u2019 of IP which L&P have erected on such shaky \nfoundations is that they fail to consider alternative approaches towards providing \nrewards for innovation, especially more market-based approaches. The need for this \nhas been recognised by other law and economics scholars, notably Kitch, who \nidentifies both the \u2018failure to consider the importance of licensing\u2019 and the \u2018failure to \n 11 \nconsider the full range of policy variables\u2019 as two of four \u2018elementary and persistent \nerrors in the economic analysis of IP\u2019 (Kitch 2000).9 We would also add the neglect of \nthe remedies for infringement, which we have mentioned are not discussed in L&P\u2019s \nbook. L&P fail to directly or systematically address these issues, no doubt because to \ndo so would both require them to abandon the assumption that innovation must be \nencouraged by property rights formed on the basis of the innovation argument, as well \nas taking them further into the thicket of the complexities of IP law and practice than \nthey would find it comfortable to go. Proper discussion of the panoply of draconian IP \nremedies, which now, of course, has added the public shaming of children to the \nincarceration of adults, would be a particularly rough ride. \n Much IP scholarship has pointed to the disadvantages of protecting innovation \nin the form of exclusive private property rights. In practice, the valorisation of IP \nrights results from the sales of products which very often embody a multiplicity of \nthose rights, frequently with different owners: for example, a multi-media product \nsuch as a DVD, which will combine music, lyrics, visuals and software; and bio-\nmedical products, which often depend on a variety of building blocks (Eisenberg \n2001). Granting each IP owner an exclusive right may create significant obstacles in \nthe form of transaction costs for bargaining over these rights. It also produces some of \nthe most deleterious effects of IP rights, such as defensive patenting to block off a \ncompeting technology. L&P discuss these problems (eg pp 310-26), but, \ncharacteristically, their discussion merely serves to relegate these problems to the \nsidelines and does not prevent them sticking to the innovation argument. \n A very different economic analysis from L&P\u2019s has been made by Shavell and \nvan Ypersle (2001), who argue that a superior approach to the private property right \nwould be a reward system, which they suggest could be based on sales data, and if \ndone continuously would be based on superior information than that available to the \ninnovator who normally has to estimate the value ex ante. L&P dismiss such \nsuggestions, as well as those for compulsory licensing, as \u2018hopelessly politicized\u2019, \nwithout any further consideration (p 9). Yet careful analysis of the factors that should \naffect optimal design of rights over innovation points to their close connection with \nthe ease of contracting over such rights (Gallini and Scotchmer 2002).  \n As we have suggested elsewhere (Picciotto and Campbell 2003), a strong case \ncan be made for treating IP not as an exclusive property right, but a right to \nremuneration. This argument has been made in particular by Jerome Reichman, \nalthough he has limited it to incremental innovations which in his view do not merit \nthe protection of full property rights (Reichman 2001). The creation of what would be \nin effect rights to use innovations, subject to acknowledgement and payment of \nappropriate fees, would, in our view, do much to redress the balance between \nappropriation and diffusion which many, including even L&P, consider has been \nweighted far too heavily in favour of exclusivity. Bargaining over the price and other \nterms of access would take place in a decentralised way in the shadow of this law, but \nsince the legal remedy would be less stringent, the outcome would be less tightly \nprescribed (in favour of the IP rights holder).10 \n \nCONCLUSION \nOne is tempted to say that the shortcomings of L&P\u2019s book are the result of the way it \nwas composed: largely a stitching together of articles produced over almost twenty \nyears. But, if the underlying argument is sufficiently sound, then, with adequate \nrevision, there is no need for this way of writing to lead to such a disjointed or even \nincoherent end-product. Posner\u2019s early, popular book on antitrust, for example, makes \n 12 \na far better job of this (Posner 1976, pp vii-viii), and even his (and Easterbrook\u2019s \n(1981)) casebook on antitrust reads more coherently than the book under review. One \nis obliged to note that the revision that has produced this book has not been adequate, \nfor how else can one account for the repeated presence of flatly contradictory \nstatements within paragraphs of each other? But the incoherence of the book is more, \nwe believe, the result of the lack of soundness of its underlying argument. L&P wish \nto defend the innovation argument for IP, but no at all competent scholar can now do \nso without difficulty, for the necessity of curtailing the IP rights granted on the \nauthority of the innovation argument is now what is most obvious to independent \nscholars (as opposed to IP lobbyists and practitioners). \n The theoretically progressive thing to do in the light of this is acknowledge the \nshortcomings of the innovation argument and seek extensive improvement upon it. \nL&P instead enter an overwhelming number of exceptions, indeed congratulate \nthemselves on having the acuity to do so, but maintain the basic argument intact. They \ndo so despite the fact that IP, whether one calls it a system of monopolies or not, is a \nsystem of government intervention designed to alter what would otherwise be the \nresults of market allocation, something about which one might have thought they \nwould feel uncomfortable The small discomfort that they actually seem to experience \nsurely is yet further evidence that Posnerian wealth maximisation has very little \nindeed to do with encouraging markets and everything to do with organising state \nsubsidy of private accumulation. \n But the, as it were, right-wing error of approving copyright legislation which the \nentertainment corporation is bound to capture, or patent regulation the agribusiness \nand pharmaceutical corporation is highly likely to capture, etc, has a complementary \nleft-wing error. The entire western marxist tradition was a critique of the degradation \nof culture produced by the corporate sales effort,11 and in a strong sense this was \nright. But this is a critique of \u2018the market\u2019, and so western marxism had had little \npower to relate its critique to specific institutions, largely degenerating into a sort of \nintellectual crie de coeur against the vulgarity of the choices of masses in the grip of \nfalse consciousness. But the \u2018culture industry\u2019 against which western marxism railed \nis a system of monopolising interventions by the state at the behest of inter alia the \norganised lobbying of capitalist corporations, ie it is not a market at all but its \nopposite; and this really is rather beyond the comprehension of most left-wing \ncritiques of corporate capitalism. \n We are here presented with a characteristic feature of the economic policy, and \ntherefore the politics, of corporate capitalism. The most apparently antithetic left and \nright-wing positions are united in their commitment to the belief that the state can \ndirectly produce optimum outcomes, and their struggle being not over means but \nends, there is a surprising degree of consensus about means. The inevitable result is a \ngrowth in the size and power of the state. In the course of this, the anarchist and \nlibertarian strains that are the highest aspirations of left and right-wing politics are put \noff to the indefinite future and the work of policy now is to get hold of the state and \nuse it. \n It is not ultimately to the credit of left-wing politics that the contradictions of IP \nare greater for the right. L&P have spent their intellectual lives decrying intervention, \nbut evidently not when corporate capitalism can find valuable use for it in the pursuit \nof accumulation, for this is wealth maximisation. The desperate tension in Posner\u2019s \nversion of law and economics between the freedom central to the concept of choice \nand the oppression central to making sure those choices maximise wealth as he \nunderstands it is nowhere more clear than in L&P\u2019s views of intellectual property, in \n 13 \nwhich even monopolies redolent of mercantilism are viewed positively so long as they \nmaximise corporate revenue. L&P have given us the benefit of their views on more or \nless everything already. There is only one subject about which they could write and \nmake more clear the bias that is the central feature of their work in general, and their \nwork on IP in particular: arms spending by the military-industrial complex. \n \nNOTES\n \n1 A review of WM Landes and RA Posner, The Economic Structure of Intellectual \nProperty Law, Cambridge, Mass, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003, \npp vi, 442, ISBN 0-674-01204-6, hbk, US$39.95. Unattributed page references are to \nthis book. An earlier version of this review was read to the Annual Conference of the \nCanadian Law and Economics Association, University of Toronto, Canada, \nSeptember 2004. We should like to thank Ronan Deazley for his comments on this \nreview. \n2 There are many passage in this book which outright contradict this, for, as L&P \nthemselves say, \u2018we have seen throughout this book\u2019 that intellectual property rights \nand \u2018physical property rights\u2019 do not have \u2018identical economic properties\u2019 (p 414), \nthat government has a \u2018much deeper involvement in intellectual than in physical \nproperty\u2019 (p 36), and, in sum, that it is \u2018perilous to extrapolate\u2019 from physical property \nto IP (p 36). It is fruitless to chase through all the statements of this sort, from which \nan unsympathetic critic would conclude that this book is just overall incoherent. \n3 We do not wish to imply that Plant is alone. In the recent scholarship, contrast L&P \nto eg Kaplow (1984, p 1817): \u2018A practice is deemed to violate the antitrust law \nbecause it is anticompetitive. But the very purpose of the patent grant is to reward the \npatentee by limiting competition, in full recognition that monopolistic evils are the \nprice society will have to pay\u2019.  \n4 A high proportion of R&D is publicly funded. According to the OECD (2004, p 70) \ndata, 30% of R&D is financed by governments; while 7% (in the US closer to 10%) \n 14 \n \nof industry spending on R&D is directly paid for by government (ie this does not \ninclude tax and other incentives). In addition, a high proportion of goods based on IP \nare price-regulated, notably pharmaceutical drugs which are purchased by state or \ninsurance-funded healthcare systems. \n5 It is only relatively recently that Posnerian law and economics has turned its \nattention to the defence of cost-benefit analysis that Posnerian law and economics \nrequires (Posner 2000). Nothing of substance seems to us to have been added to the \nvast existing literature on cost-benefit analysis in welfare economics, public \nadministration, policy analysis, etc. \n6 We feel obliged to give an example so that the non-specialist reader may follow our \nreasoning, but this is a merely illustrative example which we pick because it suits our \nargument well. The leading work on the relationship of IP and antitrust, to which L&P \nrefer (p 372 n 1), is Hovenkamp et al (2004), which uses the following example to \nillustrate the innovation argument (Hovenkamp et al 2002, para 4.1.c): \u2018Making (the \nJames Cameron film) Titanic may have cost $150,000,000\u2019, and though it \u2018can \npresumably be duplicated onto a video cassette for a cost of $2 per copy\u2019, it is \nessential that we convey \u2018very high market power\u2019 by means of copyright upon its \nowners so that they can charge $20 per copy, otherwise they will not be able to \nrecover their fixed and marginal costs and make a profit. We must make it plain that \nwe believe that Titanic is dreadful rubbish, and that the film industry in particular and \nculture in general would be better without this sort of stuff, but the point is that \nintervention should not be put on a basis where differences of opinion of this nature \nare at all to the point. Can we be so sure that the making of Titanic, and all it implies \nabout film, celebrity, advertising, etc, so optimises the social welfare function that it \n 15 \n \njustifies IP intervention? Can we be sufficiently confident about this that we should \ntrump the market\u2019s verdict that investments of this nature in Hollywood blockbusters \nshould not be made (unless at a private investor\u2019s hazard when faced with competition \nover diffusion)? \n When this paper was presented to the Canadian Law and Economics Society, a \nmember of the audience seemed to accept the point but asked \u2018what about Citizen \nKane?\u2019 Three things might be said: (1) in our opinion, exactly the same point applies \nregardless of the merit of the film; (2) a specific case for the production of Citizen \nKane might be made which would need to establish its superiority to Titanic. This \nwould be a specific case for public support (perhaps more like a patent), rather then \nthe block support presently granted by copyright. (The incorrigibility of this argument \nand its authoritarian implications are why we prefer (1) to (2)); and (3) after Citizen \nKane, Welles never again enjoyed a really productive relationship with Hollywood, \nwhich repeatedly denied him finance. Now, Welles was not blameless in this, but a \nsystem of finance based on copyright that privileges pursuit of very high volume sales \nby mass marketing of IP protected brands was more to blame. A system that denies \nadequate funds to Orson Welles but gives them in superabundance to James Cameron \ncannot easily be said to be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. \n Since this was submitted for publication, we have learned of a fourth point that \nmight be made. Weber (2004, p 6) tells us that the special effects that are the only \nother than contemptible part of Titanic were created using Linux, which is, of course, \nopen source software! The great success of Linux so contradicts the innovation \nargument that it has been called \u2018the impossible public good\u2019 (Kollock 1999, p 230). \n 16 \n \n7 The description of Posner\u2019s relationship to Coase in this paper is quite wrong, and \nwas hopefully corrected in later work (Campbell 1996). \n8 So far as we are aware, the first to apply the Chicago School approach to IP in this \nway was not Posner but Bowman, whose 1973 Patent and Antitrust Law turned on his \nbelief that both policies aimed \u2018to maximise wealth by producing what consumers \nwant at the lowest cost\u2019 (p 1). \n9 Kitch (2000, pp 1734-5) used earlier work by L&P to illustrate another such error \nand they respond to him in the book under review (pp 375-7). \n10 Unfortunately, of course, this approach is substantially precluded by the far-\nreaching impact of the Agreement on Trade Related Property Rights (hereinafter \nTRIPS) administered by the World Trade Organisation. Nevertheless, the extent and \nefficacy of IP remedies, as well as the regulation of licensing, are central policy \nquestions to be negotiated under the aegis of the TRIPS agreement.  \n11 The leading figure is, of course, Adorno, and a useful collection of his papers on the \ntheme is Adorno (1991). \n \nBIBLIOGRAPHY \nAdorno, TW (1991) The Culture Industry.
