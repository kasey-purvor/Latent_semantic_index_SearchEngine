The inscription of\nboundaries, the articulation of coherence, and the identification of threats to its\nsense of self can be located in and driven by the official discourses of government.\nBut they can equally be located in and driven by the cultural discourses of the\ncommunity, and represented in sites as \u2018unofficial\u2019 as art, film and literature. While\nsuch cultural locations are often taken to be the sites of resistance to practices of\ngovernment, their oppositional character is neither intrinsic nor guaranteed. Indeed,\nstates have often engaged in or benefited from practices of cultural governance. As\nMichael Shapiro argues, cultural governance involves support for diverse genres of\nexpression to constitute and legitimise practices of sovereignty, while restricting or\npreventing those representations that challenge sovereignty.1 In this sense, cultural\ngovernance is a set of historical practices of representation \u2013 involving the state but\nnever fully controlled by the state \u2013 in which the struggle for the state\u2019s identity is\nlocated.\nIn this article, I focus on some issues concerning the visual media\u2019s representation\nof recent wars as a means of exploring cultural governance in the contemporary\nperiod. Focusing on elements of the news media, film and documentary photo-\ngraphy, this article explores how these diverse genres have contributed to the\nexpression of collective identity. Arguing from a position in which governance and\nresistance are understood to be intrinsically related practices rather than discrete\nmodes of acting, this article also explores the pictorial challenges to common under-\nstandings that underpin the collective identities enabled by cultural governance.2 The\nstory begins with a film.\nA film fable\nLong before the United States, Britain and Australia invaded Iraq, before the attack\non the World Trade Center precipitated Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan,\nand prior to the NATO intervention in Kosovo and the Monica Lewinsky scandal,\nBarry Levinson\u2019s film Wag the Dog (1997) told the story of a president compromised\nby sexual misconduct who deflects the scandal by engineering a foreign crisis in a\nfaraway land. Based upon the plan of an intelligence operative (Conrad Brean,\nplayed by Robert de Niro), a Hollywood producer (Stanley Motts, played by Dustin\nHoffman) is engaged to construct the appearance of a war. Disturbed by the notion\nthat this ruse is untrue and will inevitably be exposed, both the nervous producer\nand anxious White House staffers are placated by Brean\u2019s belief that the truth makes\nno difference once the aura of a scandal takes hold.\nCentral to establishing the truth for both of the competing stories (the president\u2019s\nalleged affair and the emerging war) is the public use of photographs. News reports\ndetailing the allegations of sexual misconduct are anchored by an image of the\npresident with the girl who later made allegations against him. Likewise, in his effort\nto convince Motts that a Hollywood producer is ideally placed to simulate a war,\nBrean asserts that war is a performance remembered for its slogans rather than its\nspecificities. After running through a series of iconic black and white images that are\nalmost subliminally cut into the film \u2013 \u2018naked girl covered in napalm\u2019; \u2018V for\nvictory\u2019; \u2018five marines raising the flag on Mount Surabachi\u2019 \u2013 Brean asserts \u2018you\nremember the picture 50 years from now; you will have forgotten the war\u2019. Similarly\nfor the Gulf War: \u2018smart bomb falling down a chimney; 2500 missions a day; 100\ndays; one video; one bomb . . . the American people bought that war . . . war is\nshow business . . . that\u2019s why we\u2019re here\u2019, Brean says.\nBrean directs Mott to think of the war as a pageant, something with a theme,\nsong and visuals. Of course, given that the proposed war has no actuality, the images\nhave to be created from scratch. First off, an enemy has to be put in place, and\nBrean opts for Albania on the grounds that no one has heard of it and no one\nknows anything about Albanians. This permits Brean to conclude they must\ntherefore be shifty, standoff-ish and untrustworthy. On this foundation, Motts starts\nto weave a narrative of fundamentalist danger and the threat of nuclear\nproliferation, with Albanian terrorists attempting to smuggle a \u2018suitcase bomb\u2019 over\nthe Canadian border into the US.\nEmbodying conflict often requires that someone be cast in the role of victim. To\nthis end, Motts\u2019 constructs an image of a \u2018young girl in rubble . . . driven from her\nhome by Albanian terrorists\u2019 as the pivot for popular support to justify the military\nmobilisation. Captivated by the idea of having grainy, hand-held news footage with\nher clutching a kitten while running from the ruins, a series of models\u2019 photographs\nare scanned to select the suitable candidate. Rejecting one for being \u2018too Texan\u2019,\nMotts and his staff settle on a beautiful young blonde and dress her to fit the\nstereotype of East European peasant, head scarf and all. After dismissing the make-\nup lady \u2013 because the victim has to look like \u2018she\u2019s been raped by terrorists\u2019 \u2013 the\nactress makes a couple of runs towards the camera against the standard blue TV\nbackground that allows images to be manipulated around her. The production staff,\nsitting on high in the control room perusing picture library files for suitable elements\n58 David Campbell\nof the shot, digitally add the kitten along with a backdrop of a devastated village on\nfire, a bridge over a stream, and a soundtrack of screams and sirens. Mocked up in a\nfew hours, the simulated news footage is leaked via satellite and instantaneously\nbroadcast by a 24-hour news channel. After it is shown and described, the\nnewscaster concludes, \u2018America has seldom witnessed a more poignant picture of the\nhuman race\u2019. In place of the president\u2019s alleged affair, the news media had been fed a\nnew story to consume endlessly.\nNews media and contemporary war\nThe propaganda practices that make up the plot of Wag the Dog may be crude and\nfictional, but they do highlight elements found in the news media\u2019s coverage of\ncontemporary war. The insatiable appetite of a twenty-four hour news cycle, the\nproliferation of cable and satellite channels, the emotional value of feminised\nvictims, the historical resonance of iconic images, and the official appreciation of all\nthese factors, can all be located in recent coverage.\nOne of the lessons the Pentagon took from Vietnam was that the power of\ntelevision meant control of the military\u2019s message was central to the success of their\noperations. As such, the combination of independent reporting and regular military\nbriefings (the infamous \u2018five o\u2019clock follies\u2019) US officials used to conduct daily in\nSaigon were to be restricted. Learning also from the British experience in the\nFalklands, the US developed constraints for media coverage of its operations in\nGrenada and Panama, before deploying them most successfully during the Gulf War\nof 1990\u201391. By arranging selected media representatives into pools \u2013 which would\nthen be handled by military liaison staff and given only restricted access to the\nbattlefield \u2013 and organising military briefings around video images the Pentagon\nitself produced, the Pentagon effectively controlled the story of its campaign.3\nThe success of military media management in the Gulf War led to the 1992\npromulgation of the \u2018Principles of Coverage\u2019. These principles state that the US\nmilitary should, as quickly as is practicable, but cognisant of any possible impact on\nmilitary operations, provide reporters with independent access to combat operations.\nIn practice, those principles were not applied in Operation Enduring Freedom in\nAfghanistan.4 According to New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd:\nMilitary reporters say they are more handcuffed now than during Desert Storm. They have\nhad only the most restricted and supervised access to Special Operations units. Even reporters\nwho went to Afghanistan with Marines found themselves quarantined in warehouses and\nhanded press releases from Central Command in Tampa about casualties less than 100 yards\naway. Some who got close to the action had film confiscated and guns pointed at them by\nSpecial Operations soldiers or their mujahedeen bullies.5\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 59\n3 See John J. Fialka, Hotel Warriors: Covering the Gulf War (Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson\nCenter, 1992).\n4 \u2018In the War on Terrorism, a Battle to Shape Public Opinion\u2019, New York Times, 11 November 2001,\n<http:\/\/nytimes.com\/2001\/11\/11\/politics\/11PROP.html> \n5 Maureen Dowd, \u2018Coyote Rummy\u2019, New York Times, 24 February 2002, <http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\n\/2002\/02\/24\/opinion\/24DOWD.html>. See examples of this given in Frank Rich, \u2018Freedom from the\nPress\u2019, New York Times, 2 March 2002, <http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/03\/02\/opinion\/02RICH.html>\nIn the place of independent journalism, the Pentagon produced its own material.\nTo cope with the void of imagery in the opening weeks of the US military operation,\nthe Defence Department provided its own pictures, among which the firing of a\ncruise missile from a navy ship, the American flag caught in the rocket\u2019s bright\nplume, was much used around the world. Phone interviews with groups of pilots\nfresh from bombing runs over Afghanistan were arranged and their patriotic\nsentiments broadcast far and wide.6 Some operations were themselves designed for\nthe images they could produce. When US Army Rangers parachuted into a Taliban\nairbase near Kandahar in late October 2001, the story of the first action by US\nground forces was made possible by the green, grainy night video of troops in action\nreleased by the Pentagon. But the Rangers were not the first on the ground, as an\nArmy Pathfinder team had already secured the base to ensure it was safe, leading a\nnumber of senior military officials to deride the much covered parachute jump as a\n\u2018television show\u2019 designed largely to influence public opinion.7\nThe military\u2019s desire to increasingly manage information was also made clear by\nthe strange case of the proposed Office for Strategic Influence (OSI) in the\nPentagon. Throughout the fighting in Afghanistan, the US and Britain established\na series of \u2018Coalition Information Centres\u2019 in Washington, London and Islamabad\nin order to produce coordinated messages and rebuttals concerning alliance\nstrategy, and have them available for the ceaseless global news cycle. Having been\ncaught off guard by Osama Bin Laden\u2019s release of video messages to the media\nthrough Al-Jazeera, the Bush administration opted to expand the ad hoc wartime\narrangements into a new office of global diplomacy run by a former advertising\nexecutive.8 But it is the plans for the OSI that has been most revealing. Concerned\nwith \u2018information operations\u2019 to influence foreign audiences, it was envisaged after\nSeptember 11th that the OSI would coordinate everything from factual news\nreleases to foreign advertising campaigns (billboards in Pakistan with images of the\nWorld Trade Centre under attack was one suggestion) to covert disinformation\nprogrammes designed to plant pro-American stories in the international media,\nsometimes using private firms to achieve the strategy.9 The dilemma for the\nPentagon, once OSI\u2019s existence had been revealed, was how to maintain the\ncredibility of its public statements \u2013 how to make clear the Department of Defence\nwas not engaging in spreading lies, while declaring that its strategy was to engage in\n\u2018tactical deception\u2019 of people beyond the US.10 In an ironic outcome, Secretary of\nDefence Donald Rumsfeld claimed that \u2018the misinformation and adverse publicity\u2019\n60 David Campbell\n6 \u2018A Public Flooded with Images from Friend and Foe Alike\u2019, New York Times, 10 October 2001,\n<http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2001\/10\/10\/arts\/television\/10NOTE.html> \n7 For the images, see \u2018Revealed: How Bungled US Raid Came Close to Disaster\u2019, The Guardian, 6\nNovember 2001, p. 1.

While\nreporters from ABC\u2019s news division (along with those from CNN and others) were\nnot able to gain access to the military in the Afghan battlefield, the same restrictions\ndid not apply to representatives from ABCs entertainment division. In the aftermath\nof September 11th, the satirical magazine The Onion ran an article entitled\n\u2018American Life Turns into Bad Jerry Bruckheimer Movie.\u201912 It is a notion that was\nstrangely prescient. Bruckheimer, the producer of successful blockbusters such as\nTop Gun, Pearl Harbour, and Black Hawk Down, joined forces with the television\nproducer behind the reality programme \u2018Cops\u2019 to develop a \u2018patriotic\u2019 series about\nUS soldiers fighting the war against terrorism. All Bruckheimer\u2019s films have\nportrayed the US military favourably, which is not surprising given they were made\nwith the Pentagon\u2019s assistance and blessing (in the case of Black Hawk Down, they\nprovided the Apache helicopters and one hundred soldiers on location in Morocco).\nSimilar cooperation made the six hour-long episodes of the \u2018Profiles from the\nFrontline\u2019 project possible, with the Pentagon guaranteeing access to those US\ntroops in Afghanistan and around the world previously shielded from news\njournalists.13 Screened on network television in the month prior to the invasion of\nIraq, \u2018Profiles\u2019 provided a visual link for the war on terror from Afghanistan to Iraq,\nand gave both the media and the viewers a clear idea as to how the strategy of\n\u2018embedding\u2019 journalists with military units would produce a paean to valour and\nvirtue.14\nThe Bruckheimer production of the war on terrorism will not be the only\nHollywood film effort in this new patriotic struggle. There is, of course, a long\nhistory of Hollywood\u2019s association with US military causes, so cooperation post-\nSeptember 11th is hardly novel. Nonetheless, the willingness of all branches of the\ntelevision and film industry to meet President Bush\u2019s top political advisor Karl Rove\nin November 2001 reflected, as the head of Paramount Pictures said, \u2018this incredible\nneed, this incredible urge to do something.\u201915 Notwithstanding the administration\nand industry\u2019s assertions that there is no question of the government control of\ncontent, it is clear from such views that official control, let alone censorship, would\nbe redundant. Moreover, increasingly positive portrayals of US national security\nissues predate September 11th. After years of declining even media comment, let\nalone media assistance, and reaping a negative image in film and television as a\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 61\n11 \u2018Pentagon May Eliminate New Office of Influence\u2019, The New York Times, 25 February 2002,\n<http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/02\/25\/politics\/25CND-MILI.html>; \u2018Rumsfeld Formally Disbands\nOffice of Strategic Influence,\u2019 New York Times, 26 February 2002, <http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2002\/\n02\/26\/national\/26CND-PENTAG.html> \n12 \u2018American Life Turns Into Bad Jerry Bruckheimer Movie\u2019, The Onion, 26 September 2001,\n<http:\/\/www.theonion.com\/onion3734\/american_life_turns_into.html> \n13 \u2018\u201cReality TV\u201d About GIs on War Duty\u2019, New York Times, 21 February 2002, available from the New\nYork Times on-line archive.\n14 For details of the show, see its official web site at <http:\/\/abc.go.com\/primetime\/profiles> \n15 \u2018Hollywood Signs on to Assist War Effort\u2019, Los Angeles Times, 12 November 2001, <http:\/\/www.\nlatimes.com\/news\/local\/la-111201holly.story> \nresult, the CIA appointed a former Latin American specialist as a full-time enter-\ntainment liaison officer. With the promise of official cooperation, scriptwriters and\nproducers have submitted their work for approval, and incorporated suggestions\nfrom CIA staff. The result has been some three television series and five feature films\nin which the agency is flatteringly featured as hard-working and heroic, though some\n(such as the Robert Redford movie Spy Game and the television series 24) were\ncompleted and shown even though agency approval was withheld.16\nIt is important to understand \u2013 so that we can appreciate the full extent of the\nchallenge that faces those who want to develop a politically critical stance in relation\nto developments and issues such as those outlined here \u2013 that the interweaving and\ninterdependence of the military, media and information industries is neither an\nunforeseen accident or a failure of nerve on the part of the participants (especially\nthe media). This blurring of what previously appeared to be distinct domains is the\ncore of the new military strategy that results from the \u2018 Revolution in Military\nAffairs\u2019 (RMA) that has preoccupied the Pentagon for some time.17 The RMA is\nconcerned with how networked information technology is integrated into and\nchanges the battlefield for the US military. One of the principal changes that result\nfrom this is a different understanding of the nature and extent of \u2018the battlefield\u2019.\nNo longer confined to a spatial or temporal exception, it stems from what James Der\nDerian has called the \u2018military-industrial-media-entertainment network (MIME-\nNET)\u2019.18 While the interaction of civilian and military technologies is not a recent\ndevelopment, what is new about MIME-NET, Der Derian argues, \u2018is the power of\nMIME-NET to seamlessly merge the production, representation, and execution of\nwar. The result is not merely the copy of a copy, or the creation of something new:\nIt represents a convergence of the means by which we distinguish the original and\nthe new, the real from the reproduced.\u201919 This seamless merging of production,\nrepresentation and execution comes about because \u2018the new wars are fought in the\nsame manner as they are represented, by military simulations and public dissimul-\nations, by real-time surveillance and TV live-feeds. Virtuality collapses distance,\nbetween here and there, near and far, fact and fiction.\u201920 As a result, the battlefield is\nnow global and inclusive, overriding previous boundaries between the military and\ncivilian, combatant and non-combatant, participant and observer. In such a world,\nthe Pentagon\u2019s suffocating restrictions on the press, the demise of news programmes\nin the face of entertainment alternatives, intimate relations between Hollywood and\nthe national security establishment, and the conduct of military operations for their\ninformation outcomes and representational value in the struggle for strategic\ninfluence, are the norm rather than the exception.\nFrom the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the story of Private Jessica Lynch\u2019s \u2018rescue\u2019\ndemonstrates the ever-increasing cultural governance of the news media by the\n62 David Campbell\n16 \u2018Hollywood Helps CIA Come in From the Cold\u2019, The Guardian, 6 September 2001, <http:\/\/www.\nguardian.co.uk\/Archive\/Article\/0,4273,4251281,00.html>, \u2018The Caring, Sharing CIA\u2019, The Guardian, 5\nOctober 2001, <http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/Archive\/Article\/0,4273,4270257,00.html> \n17 For details, see the on-line resource The RMA Debate at <http:\/\/www.comw.org\/rma\/index.html>\n18 James Der Derian, Virtuous War: Mapping the Military-Industrial-Media-Entertainment Network\n(Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 2001).\n19 Ibid, xx.\n20 Ibid, xviii.\nmilitary. Lynch\u2019s release was made public through the Coalition Media Centre\n(CMC) at the US Central Command headquarters in Qatar. This $1.5m briefing\noperation, with a futuristic, Hollywood-inspired set replete with plasma TV screens,\nis housed in a remote warehouse hundreds of miles from the battlefield, but offering\nthe military overview desired by its US, UK, and Australian media minders. The\nCMC was integral to the strategy of embedding reporters with military units, for\nthose on the front line provided images and stories from an unavoidably narrow\nperspective, while the journalists at the CMC were given what was said to be the\nbroad overview but in effect only amplified the narrow perspective desired by the\nPentagon and its partners. As one media critic observed, the 500 or more \u2018embeds\u2019\n(with 100 cameras) were \u2018close up at the front\u2019 while the 600 CMC journalists were\n\u2018tied up in the rear\u2019. This meant the military could be confidant journalists would\nproduce \u2018maximum imagery with minimum insight\u2019.21\nThe Lynch story demonstrated how well this operation could function. CMC\njournalists were roused from their sleep in the early hours of 2 April, thinking that a\nmajor story (such as the death of Saddam Hussein) was breaking. Instead they were\npresented with an edited five-minute military video \u2013 shot through a night lens,\nproducing green, grainy images of silhouetted figures \u2013 detailing the Special Forces\nrescue of Private Lynch. The video encapsulated a narrative familiar to viewers of\nBlack Hawk Down and Behind Enemy Lines \u2013 that the US military \u2018never leaves a\nfallen comrade\u2019. A single still image was taken from this operation and circulated\nwidely, showing Lynch lying on a stretcher aboard a US special forces helicopter,\nsmiling grimly from under a US flag draped across her chest.\nThat Jessica Lynch is a fair-skinned, 19 year old blonde female from West\nVirginia helped spur the stories of heroism surrounding her captivity and rescue.\nSaid to be suffering gun shot and stab wounds, and having been reportedly mis-\ntreated during her detention in an Iraqi hospital, a much used Washington Post story\nfrom 3 April cited unnamed sources as describing how Lynch had fought bravely\nduring the battle of 23 March that led to her capture, firing a weapon repeatedly\ndespite being hit and seeing many of her comrades killed.22 Unsurprisingly, the\ncinematic quality of this description has led to quickly produced TV documentaries\n(the Arts and Entertainment network screened \u2018Saving Jessica Lynch\u2019 within two\nweeks of her rescue) and a massive effort to secure an exclusive interview upon her\nrecovery, with CBS (which is part of the media conglomerate Viacom) offering a\npackage of media inducements that included proposals for shows and publications\nfrom CBS News, CBS Entertainment, MTV (who dangled the prospect of Lynch co-\nhosting an hour long programme, with a concert held in her home town of Palestine,\nWest Virginia), Paramount Pictures, and Simon and Schuster books.23\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 63\n21 John Kampfner, \u2018War Spin\u2019, Correspondent, BBC2, 18 May 2003.

But later media investigations have discovered that most of the\ndramatic elements of the early accounts of Lynch\u2019s condition and return are open to\nserious question. A BBC documentary, which interviewed staff involved in Lynch\u2019s\ncare after the war had been declared over, revealed that she had no war wounds but\nwas diagnosed as a serious road traffic accident victim, had received the best\navailable treatment from Iraqi medical staff, and that their attempt to return her to\nUS forces in an ambulance had been repelled at a US military checkpoint.24\nWhile the basic coordinates of Lynch\u2019s story were not invented (she was injured,\ncaptured then recovered), the account was staged, in so far as the particular\nnarrative that was attached to and derived from the military film of her release was\nconstructed by the Pentagon\u2019s media operation to convey a heroic and redemptive\nmeaning (implicitly recalling the captivity narratives common in the early days of\nAmerican settlement, with Iraq functioning as \u2018Indian country\u2019). The power of the\nimage \u2013 both the night-vision video, and the still of Lynch on the stretcher, redolent\nof the fair-haired victim in Wag the Dog \u2013 was key to the way this account repre-\nsented part of the invasion of Iraq. But are there images resistant to such official\ndiscourses of cultural governance?\nIt is important to remember that, whatever the power of MIME-NET and\ninformation warfare strategies, alternative images to those released and broadcast\nare captured all the time. That is because a not insignificant number of cameramen\nand photographers operate independently and unilaterally in war zones. But even\nembedded cameramen have recorded shocking images of wars effects that counter\nthe clean narratives of surgical strikes. The problem is that the media industry itself\noperates in terms of codes and norms that mesh with the military\u2019s restrictions and\nprevent the public release of such images by invoking conceptions of \u2018taste\u2019 and\n\u2018decency\u2019. In this context, it is worth exploring one branch of the media that has not\nbowed to these conventions and continues to represent much of the unvarnished\nhorror of war \u2013 the traditions of documentary photography and photojournalism.\nThis necessitates reflecting on concerns about the truth of the photograph, before\nexamining Don McCullin\u2019s photojournalism as an instance of potential pictorial\nresistance to the cultural governance of war\u2019s representation.\nPhotographs and the question of truth\nIt might seem anachronistic in the age of digital video and real-time news coverage\nto be concerned with the photojournalism of war and the politics of documentary\nphotography. After all, it has been argued that Biafra (in 1968) was the last war in\nwhich newspapers scooped television, and black and white photographs played a\n64 David Campbell\n24 Kampfner, \u2018War Spin\u2019, Correspondent, BBC2, 18 May 2003; Kampfner, \u2018The Truth about Jessica\u2019, The\nGuardian (G2 supplement), 15 May 2003, pp. 2\u20133. Many of these features were confirmed by the\nWashington Post\u2019s re-examination of the story two months after its initial account (which is no longer\navailable in its online archives).

Indeed, as Susan Sontag has argued, it might be precisely because of\nthe ubiquity of television\u2019s visual flow that the arrest of time in the photograph\noffers space for contemplation and critique.26\nThe digital age has, however, had an important impact on contemporary debates\nabout photography. With the increased capacity for pictorial manipulation arising\nfrom the use of digital cameras and computer imaging, public laments about the\nassociated loss of authority and truth are common. For example, the new tech-\nnology has led Fred Ritchin to wonder how the photograph\u2019s documentary authority\ncan be maintained when the computer provides no archival notion of an original\nphotographic negative against which changes and tamperings could be checked. As a\nresult, Ritchin speculates that ever-increasing digitisation might paradoxically mean\n\u2018a revival of the largely dormant photo essay taken by living, breathing, thinking\nphotographers; the photograph, unchained from its simplistic role of authentication,\nwill then be recognized for its linguistic subtlety and broader reach\u2019.27\nWhile computerisation might produce that paradoxical outcome, the resultant\nphotographic product will not function as a stable referent of objective truth in\ncontrast to the computer\u2019s indeterminate subjectivism. In large part, that is because\nthe age of computer-based photography has heightened but not introduced the\nelement of bias to an otherwise certain domain. Indeed, the digital revolution\u2019s most\nimportant effect has been to end the \u2018interlude of false innocence\u2019 in which the\nreferential veracity of the photographic image was too often unquestioned.28 But\neven those who did not assume that photography corresponded directly to the\nexternal world, have sometimes been moved by the computer to a different position.\nAs John Roberts observes, \u2018one of the ironies of the debate on simulation and the\nchemical photograph is that all those who previously took documentary photo-\ngraphy to task for believing in the \u2018truth-value\u2019 of the naturalistic image, now talk\nnostalgically about the disappearance of documentary\u2019s reportorial and archival\nrole\u2019.29\nThe irony of this situation is even more marked if we reflect on the way the truth-\nvalue of the photographic image has always been challenged through allegations of\nmanipulation leading to fraud. Indeed, many of the most famous war photographs\nhave been the subject of controversy, with at least elements of the alleged naturalism\ndispelled. For example, during the American civil war, photographers (such as\nAlexander Gardner and Matthew Brady) moved bodies around to make images;30\nRobert Capa\u2019s falling Spanish republican soldier is alleged to have been staged (or at\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 65\n25 Jonathan Benthall, Disasters, Relief and the Media (London: I.B.

Rothstein placed a locally\nobtained cow skull against various backdrops to obtain an image of the economic\nand environmental plight of farmers in the area. As part of the famous Farm\nSecurity Administration\u2019s (FSA) photographic unit, which did so much to establish\nthe reputation of documentary photography as a progressive social practice, Rothstein\nwas part of the effort to visualise the Depression in such a way that enabled New\nDeal policies. As such, regional newspapers opposed to the economic strategies of\nthe New Deal seized on Rothstein\u2019s work as a way of supposedly demonstrating that\nsuch policies were based on \u2018trickery\u2019.35\nGiven the political stakes in the debate around Rothstein\u2019s image, the controversy\nalmost brought a premature end to the FSA photographic unit by putting in doubt\nthe aura of naturalist veracity its work had acquired.36 Even some of Rothstein\u2019s\ncolleagues were appalled by his action. Walker Evans, one of the FSA\u2019s most famous\nphotographers and one of the most noteworthy photographers of the twentieth\ncentury, declared \u2018that that\u2019s where the word \u201cdocumentary\u201d holds: you don\u2019t touch\na thing. You \u201cmanipulate\u201d, if you like, when you frame a picture \u2013 one foot one way\nor one foot another. But you\u2019re not sticking anything in.\u201937\nEvans\u2019 stipulation that one can \u2018manipulate\u2019 in terms of picture selection and\ncomposition, but one cannot \u2018stick anything in\u2019, requires a fine but tenuous sense of\nlegitimate practice.

However, each of the above\nexamples of controversial war pictures demonstrates the way in which these well\nunderstood realist accounts of photography are largely insufficient in making sense\nof the politics of photography. That is because in each of the cases there is no fraud\nequivalent to the obviously staged nineteenth-century images of fairies at the bottom\nof the garden, equivalent attempts to portray the Loch Ness monster or UFOs, or\nthe manipulative construction of the Albanian victim in Wag the Dog. In each of\nthe above cases, none of the critics doubt the basic elements of the images were\nthere; what they doubt are the meanings most derive from the use of such images.\nWhich raises the interesting prospect that a realist image may be a poorer conveyer\nof truth than either a heavily interpreted or even partially constructed image (such\nas Rothstein\u2019s cow skull). If we accept that, then what is the line \u2013 if any such line\nexists \u2013 between Rothstein\u2019s cow skull and Wag the Dog\u2019s Albanian beauty?\nOne of the major problems with war photography that focuses on victims as an\nantidote to heroic images is that it can produce a generalised and standardised visual\naccount that anonymises victims and depoliticises conflict.38 This results in what\nAllen Feldman calls \u2018cultural anaesthesia\u2019, and effects what Martha Rosler has\ntermed the revictimisation of victims.39 Moreover, given the importance of photo-\ngraphy in the emergence of social science discourses such as anthropology and\ncriminology in the late nineteenth century, the reduction of the mobile and multiple\ncontingencies of personhood to the figure of a static, one-dimensional victim have a\nlong history. As John Tagg observes, in turn-of-the-century social science \u2018the\nworking classes, colonised peoples, the criminal, poor, ill-housed, sick or insane were\nconstituted as the passive \u2013 or, in this structure, \u201cfeminised\u201d \u2013 objects of knowledge.\nSubjected to a scrutinising gaze, forced to emit signs, yet cut off from command of\nmeaning, such groups were represented as, and wishfully rendered, incapable of\nspeaking, acting or organising for themselves.\u201940\nThe issue to consider, then, is whether being \u2018culturally anaesthetic\u2019 is an\ninevitable and unavoidable element of the photographic representation of victims of\nwar, and to ask what are modes of photographic representation that can dissimulate\nif not dispense with such depoliticising effects? To locate this questioning, I will look\nat the work of noted British photojournalist Don McCullin.\nDon McCullin and the ghosts of victims\nKnown in particular for his photographs of the conflict in Cyprus, the war-driven\nfamine of Biafra, the fighting in Vietnam and the refugees created by the secession\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 67\n38 Allen Feldman, \u2018On Cultural Anaesthesia: From Desert Storm to Rodney King\u2019, American\nEthnologist, 21:2 (May 1994), p. 407; and Liisa Malkki, \u2018Speechless Emissaries: Refugees,\nHumanitarianism, and Dehistoricization\u2019, Cultural Anthropology, 11:3 (1996), p. 386.\n39 Cited in Andrea Liss, Trespassing Through the Shadows: Memory, Photography and the Holocaust\n(Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1998, p. xiv.\n40 John Tagg, The Burden of Representation: Essays on Photographies and Histories (Minneapolis, MN:\nUniversity of Minnesota Press, 1993), p. 11.\nof East Pakistan, Don McCullin readily acknowledges that his photography is\npreoccupied with often personalised images of atrocity. \u2018I thought of my pictures as\natrocity pictures. They were not of war but of the dreadful plight of victims of\nwar.\u201941 Invariably, though not exclusively, composed of one or two individuals in a\nsituation of distress, McCullin\u2019s dark, tonal images brood with a violence that\nexceeds the events being depicted.\nThe force of these images \u2013 what McCullin describes as their \u2018fist-like black and\nwhite\u2019 quality \u2013 is not something developed because of the fetishistic pleasure of\ndeath and disaster.42 As Mark Haworth-Booth has observed, McCullin\u2019s \u2018photo-\ngraphy of suffering has been a kind of service\u2019 to its audience.43 The nature of that\nservice? To be a witness \u2013 \u2018someone who epitomises the role of witness to the despair\nof our time\u2019,44 \u2018our eye-witness\u2019, a \u2018passionately eloquent witness\u2019 whose work is\nitself a \u2018witness to history\u2019.45\nEssential to the role of witness for McCullin is emotion. \u2018Photography for me is\nnot looking, it\u2019s feeling. If you can\u2019t feel what you\u2019re looking at, then you\u2019re never\ngoing to get others to feel anything when they look at your pictures.\u201946 What\nMcCullin feels more often than not is a combination of disgust at the violent\ncircumstances embracing the innocent, and an empathy with those who become the\nvictims of war. Indeed, for McCullin that empathy is so strong he shares intimately\nthe danger of those being fired upon. \u2018There were times\u2019, McCullin says, \u2018looking at\nthose people when I felt I was looking at a mirror. There was an empathy because of\nmy background. It never went away from me.\u201947\nEmpathetic witnessing, McCullin originally thought, would not be a political\nexercise. \u2018When I began as a photographer, I believed that my work would suffer if I\nallowed it to become political. In the event, it turned out to be nothing but political\nfor I consistently took the side of the underdog and the under-privileged.\u201948 This\npolitical exercise in photography was, however, for a clear purpose. By portraying\n\u2018the appalling things we are all capable of doing to our fellow human beings\u2019,\nMcCullin\u2019s photojournalism sought \u2018to stir the conscience of others who can help\u2019;\nto show those comfortably at home in Britain . . . how these people were suffering.\u201949\nBut while political, McCullin\u2019s pictures, especially those of Biafra, \u2018were not\npartisan. I would like to think these images brought help to the beleaguered\nhospitals with their dying children. I knew my pictures had a message, but what it\nwas precisely I couldn\u2019t have said \u2013 except perhaps, that I wanted to break the hearts\nand spirits of secure people.\u201950\n68 David Campbell\n41 Don McCullin, Unreasonable Behaviour: An Autobiography (London, Vintage, 1992), p. 165.\n42 Quoted in Pam Roberts, \u2018War and Peace\u2019, in Don McCullin: A Retrospective (London: British\nCouncil, 1993), p. 7.\n43 Mark Haworth-Booth, \u2018Introduction\u2019, in Don McCullin, Sleeping with Ghosts (London: Jonathan\nCape, 1994), p. 11.\n44 Mark Holborn, \u2018Don McCullin\u2019, at <http:\/\/www.hamiltonsgallery.com\/>, 20 August 2003.\n45 Haworth-Booth, \u2018Introduction\u2019, p. 9.

Perhaps for this reason, Don McCullin has been haunted by his work,\noften commenting on the presence of ghosts in his world. Reflecting on how he\noperated during the East Pakistan refugee crisis, McCullin has remarked, \u2018I felt as if\nI were using the camera as something to hide behind. I stood there feeling less than\nhuman, with no flesh on me, like a ghost that was present but invisible.\u201951 The motif\nextends to the production of the print itself: \u2018If I\u2019m printing a picture of a man\nwhose wife lies dead before him, or the albino boy in Biafra, the moment I see them\nappearing through the fog of the developer it\u2019s as if they are still alive, and the full\nforce of the tragedy comes flooding back\u2019.52 Not surprisingly, given that a\nphotojournalist such as McCullin finds himself surrounded by an archive of still\nimages of dead people who can be brought back to a limited form of pictorial life,\nthe retrospective exhibition at the V & A Museum in London displaying McCullin\u2019s\nlifetime of work was entitled Sleeping With Ghosts.\nOf course, one of the spectres hanging over the status of the documentary\nphotograph as authentic witness is the code of practice articulated by Walker Evans\nand discussed earlier. Evans insisted that the truth of a realistic image can only be\nsecured by the photographer refraining from meddling in any way with the subject\n(beyond the need to compose the shot), and declared that the whole point about\ndocumentary is \u2018that you don\u2019t touch a thing\u2019 and you certainly \u2018cannot stick\nanything in\u2019. It is a view that McCullin \u2013 who has argued, \u2018what comes into the\nframe is truth\u2019 \u2013 endorses.53\nHowever, in his role as eyewitness, trying to convey an image to a distant public\nthat might disturb their collective conscience, McCullin has occasionally violated\nEvans\u2019 dictum in a manner akin to Arthur Rothstein\u2019s New Deal photograph. One\ncase in point is his famous image of a dead North Vietnamese soldier lying, eyes\nfixed open and arm outstretched, next to his scattered personal effects \u2013 his wallet\nwith the photo of a young child, along with a letter and other family photos strewn\nfrom an open tin. The placement of these personal effects alongside the body was\nsomething that McCullin created. As he has explained: \u2018I saw a whole bunch of\n[American] soldiers vandalising his body for souvenirs. I thought there\u2019s got to be\nsomething I can say about this. So I put these things together, I put them there to\nmake the picture. It was the first time I thought I could justify it. And I don\u2019t have\nany shame about doing it. It wasn\u2019t the dead soldier that is the statement, it was the\nfamily photographs, the wallet. I was making a still-life.\u201954\nMcCullin experienced a similar moment in Biafra. One of his photographs from\nthat conflict shows a solitary girl perched on a wooden bench. Smiling wanly, the\nimage is notable in part for the girl\u2019s hands crossed in her lap, a pose that would not,\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 69\n51 Ibid., p. 165.\n52 Hamilton, \u2018Laying some Ghosts to Rest\u2019, p. 299.\n53 Ibid.\n54 Quoted Ibid., p. 300.

McCullin has discussed how this picture was produced:\nBefore leaving I found a young girl of about sixteen sitting naked in a hut, looking ill and\nvery frail, but beautiful. Her name, I was told, was Patience. I wanted to photograph her and\nasked the orderly if she would persuade the girl to cover the private parts of her body with\nher hands so that I could show her nakedness with as much dignity as possible. But the sight\nof her stripped me naked of any of the qualities I might have had as a human being. The\nwhiplash of compassion and conscience never ceased to assail me in Biafra.55\nIn this case, as many others, the portrayal of the victim\u2019s dignity was McCullin\u2019s\npurpose. Commenting on his experience of covering a famine in the Bihar region of\nIndia, McCullin observed \u2018no heroics are possible when you are photographing\npeople who are starving. All I could do was try to give the people caught up in this\nterrible disaster as much dignity as possible.\u201956 In common with a photojournalist\nlike Sebastiao Salgado, McCullin has made dignity the leitmotif of his work.\nEqually in common with Salgado, the portrayal of dignity has meant that McCullin\u2019s\nwork has entered the debate about the place and role of aesthetic values in atrocity\npictures.57\nThe identification of beauty in the midst of disaster is controversial and contest-\nable. While the alleged timelessness and universality of images like the McCullin\nphotograph of Patience are often taken to be the product of the aestheticisation of\nthe image, and this is taken to be one way to make an image stand out despite its\ngeneralisable quality, critics such as Robin Andersen maintain that aestheticisation\nonly further depoliticises the issue at hand, especially when tragedy is the product of\nagony beautified. As Andersen remarks, \u2018the beautification of squalid reality offers\nthe viewer a certain amount of emotional distance. This distancing lessens the\nimpact, and in the process the media have created a public which has learned not to\ncare much.\u201958\nSuch effects would be contrary to most photojournalists\u2019 hopes. They would\ncertainly be contrary to what McCullin has aimed for with his documentary work.\nNonetheless, the standard critique of McCullin\u2019s work is that his overriding emphasis\non subjects either alone, or framed with another in a similar state of suffering, is\nhighly problematic. As Andersen writes:\nIn McCullin\u2019s work, and in much of the work of photographers who have come after him,\nneither starvation\u2019s victims nor victims of war are shown in a social context. They don\u2019t\nexplain or inform. They become suffering individuals of the human condition. The social and\npolitical \u2013 human made \u2013 causes are not in appearance, and therefore not in the image. And\nmany times, indeed most, the news context does not supply adequate information and\nexplanations.59\n70 David Campbell\n55 McCullin, Unreasonable Behaviour, p. 124.

Andersen, \u2018The Ideological Significance of News Photography: The Case of El Salvador\u2019,\nIdeologies and Literature, 3:2 (Fall 1988), p. 251.\n59 Ibid, pp. 237\u20138.\nIn Andersen\u2019s view, \u2018without a social or political context, and without information\nor explanations which would explain or account for suffering, photographs which\ndocument pain, misery and death cannot elicit public concern and empathy\u2019.60\nFor one concerned to emphasise the importance of context, Andersen makes a\ndefinitive and emphatic judgement about what the photograph alone can and cannot\ndo. It is, moreover, a judgement that differs in some respects from John Berger\u2019s\nmeditation on the potential impact of what he calls atrocity photos. Moved to write\nafter viewing a McCullin photo from Vietnam, Berger opined that such images had\none predominant purpose:\nThey bring us up short. The most literal adjective that could be applied to them is arresting.\nWe are seized by them . . . As we look at them, the moment of the other\u2019s suffering engulfs us.\nWe are filled with either despair or indignation. Despair takes on some of the other\u2019s suffering\nto no purpose. Indignation demands action. We try to emerge from the moment of the\nphotograph back into our lives. As we do so, the contrast is such that the resumption of our\nlives appears to be a hopelessly inadequate response to what we have just seen.61\nThe terms of Berger\u2019s reading are, of course, loaded, the only options for response\nbeing \u2018despair\u2019 versus \u2018indignation\u2019, with despair having no purpose. Berger is\ninterested in whether a photograph can politicise understanding, and appears to\nendorse Roland Barthes\u2019 notion that \u2018photography is subversive not when it\nfrightens, repels, or even stigmatises, but when it is pensive, when it thinks\u2019.62 In this\ncontext, Berger claims \u2018it is not possible for anyone to look pensively at such a\nmoment [of agony, as in McCullin\u2019s photos] and emerge stronger\u2019.63\nAlthough he wants to rule out this possible effect, Berger nonetheless thinks that\nthe war photo is contradictory. While it is assumed to awaken concern, once the\nreader who is arrested by the image emerges from it to carry on with her life, the\ndisjuncture of the experience will leave her, says Berger, feeling morally inadequate.\nThat inadequacy may now shock her as much as the war itself, and either she shrugs\nthat paradox off or \u2018 [s]he thinks of performing a kind of penance \u2013 of which the\npurest example would be to make a contribution to OXFAM or to UNICEF\u2019.\nWhatever the response, concludes Berger, \u2018the issue of the war which had caused\nthat moment is effectively depoliticised. The picture becomes evidence of the general\nhuman condition. It accuses nobody and everybody.\u201964 Andersen thinks atrocity\nphotos cannot elicit concern and sympathy, while Berger thinks they do provoke a\nresponse, but one that is misplaced and unhelpful.\nConcluding reflections\nThose differences notwithstanding, both Andersen\u2019s and Berger\u2019s accounts burden\nthe image itself with the responsibility for politicisation, rather than viewing it in the\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 71\n60 Ibid, p. 238.

However, this identification of\nthe importance of the pictorial does not mean that we have to invent a new and\nsingular mode of analysis for the visual.65 As W. J. T. Mitchell argues, \u2018whatever the\npictorial turn is, then, it should be clear that it is not a return to na\u00efve mimesis, copy\nor correspondence theories of representation, or a renewed metaphysics of pictorial\n\u201cpresence\u201d; it is rather a postlinguistic, postsemiotic rediscovery of the picture as a\ncomplex interplay between visuality, apparatus, institutions, discourse, bodies, and\nfigurality\u2019.66 As such, Mitchell\u2019s argument chimes with Susan Sontag\u2019s view that\nwhile the photograph is significant because of its capacity to engender a space for\nthought, it cannot by itself be an instrument for change. Sontag maintains the image\ncan help build or reinforce a moral position, but it cannot create such a position in\nthe absence of \u2018an appropriate context of feeling and attitude\u2019.67 In other words, the\nphotograph requires the politics produced by the interplay of image and context\nabout which Mitchell writes. Moreover, the photograph requires the overt and\ncommitted politics of a photojournalist like Don McCullin.\nAs a practice of resistance, documentary photography has its work cut out. The\nspeed at which (dis)information circulates in the media-managed battle space means\nthe time for contemplation and critique offered by the still image is more com-\npressed than ever. Nonetheless, while the images alone are unlikely to lead to change,\nespecially in the short time available, they become part of what Sontag calls the vast\nrepository of pictures that make it difficult to sustain the \u2018moral defectiveness\u2019 of\nignorance or innocence in the face of suffering. Images may only be an invitation to\npay attention. But the questions photographs of war and atrocity pose should be\nrequired of our leaders and us: \u2018Who caused what the picture shows? Who is\nresponsible? Is it excusable? Was it inevitable? Is there some state of affairs which we\nhave accepted up to now that ought to be challenged?\u201968\nThe conclusion Sontag reaches is a battle cry in which the picture functions as a\nghost: \u2018Let the atrocious images haunt us. Even if they are only tokens, and cannot\npossibly encompass most of the reality to which they refer, they still perform a vital\nfunction. The images say: This is what human beings are capable of doing \u2013 may\nvolunteer to do, enthusiastically, self-righteously. Don\u2019t forget.\u201969 The Guardian used\nthis Sontag quote in a short editorial to support its publication, twelve years after\nthe event, of many previously unseen photographs from the Persian Gulf War.70\nUnder the title \u2018Blood in the Sand\u2019 and edited by Don McCullin, these unsparing\n72 David Campbell\n65 See Martin Jay, \u2018Vision in Context: Reflections and Refractions\u2019, in Vision in Context: Historical and\nContemporary Perspectives on Sight, eds.

As evidence of the infamous \u2018turkey shoot\u2019 on the Basra road \u2013 when allied\njets devastated a vast convoy of Iraqi vehicles after they had fled Kuwait \u2013 this\nphotograph immediately contested the well-established view of the conflict as\ncasualty-free. Against the larger narrative of the conduct of the Gulf War, this\nimage functioned as a point of disruption, a reminder of what that narrative hid. As\na result, the publication of the photo was immediately controversial, with the\npolitical issues of reportage being contested by complaints of taste. Indeed, in most\nnewspapers, issues of taste easily trumped the significance of the photograph as\neditors refused to contemplate its publication.72\nNonetheless, Kenneth Jarecke\u2019s photograph demonstrates the potential (through\nits publication both in 1991 and 2003) for such images to serve as a form of \u2018post-\nreportage\u2019, whereby one can speak in \u2018considered retrospect\u2019 of events narrated in\ncontradictory ways.73 In this context, what photographs can do is \u2018provide moments\nof silence, caught in the uneasy space between what was experienced there and what\nis being experienced here\u2019.74 Evocative of Barthes\u2019 contention that the photograph\nproduces a different rendering of space-time, and is subversive when it is pensive,\nunderstanding photographs as opening critical spaces for thought (and political re-\nenactments) through their narrative positioning is suggestive of one way to promote\nphotography\u2019s capacity to politicise war \u2013 especially when the power of MIME-NET\npropels us frighteningly close to the official promulgation of Wag the Dog\u2019s prop-\naganda practices. It is a position that neither dismisses the art gallery as a critical\nsite for public consumption (especially given the way a gallery and its commentary\nfosters contemplation rather than gratification), nor insists that a strict adherence to\nrealist documentary protocols is essential for the truth-value of an image.\nWith the changing international political economy of the media \u2013 in which serious\ndocumentary reportage has given way to the fluff of consumerist lifestyle coverage \u2013\nthese alternative uses and locations of images are far from being irrelevant to the\ndevelopment of resistant political positions. Moreover, it demonstrates that pictorial\nresistance to the official practices of cultural governance can take place in a\nmultitude of previously unacknowledged political spaces. What is required, however,\nis for that resistance to be timelier, more in tune with the speed of contemporary\nwar.\nCultural governance and pictorial resistance 73\n71 The Guardian (G2), 14 February 2003, pp. 1\u201317.
