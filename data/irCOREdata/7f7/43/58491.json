Introduction \nIn China, most  industrial development and therefore the majority of large sources of carbon dioxide (CO2), lie \nalong the eastern coastline and consequently storage sites are being sought is this area. The COACH (Cooperative \naction within Carbon Capture and Storage China-EU) project considers storage in the Bohai Basin, a rift-subsidence \nbasin located in north-eastern China, south-east of Beijing (Figure 1). The work on storage capacity in the COACH \nproject is building on the earlier work in China of the EU GeoCapacity project (Bohai Basin, Hebei Province) and is \ncomplemented by investigation of the UK-NZEC (Near Zero Emissions from Coal) project (Jilin Province, Subei \nBasin and Songliao Basin).  \n \nThe Bohai Basin was formed during the Cenozoic when frequent tectonic movements developed numerous fault \nblocks. During Cenozoic rifting, the basin divided into six sub-basins; Liaohe, Jizhong, Huanghua, Bozhong, Jiyang \nand Linqing  [1]. Each of these sub-basins or depressions has been independently affected by tectonic activity and \nsedimentation.  \n \nFrom collation of large sources in the Shandong Province, average annual emissions for power stations larger \nthan 100 mW (Megawatts) in the Shandong Province were 2.5 Mt; over a 25-year estimated lifespan of a power \nplant this would mean that a storage volume of 62.5 Mt would be required for a full-scale demonstration of carbon \ncapture and storage (CCS).  \n \n* Corresponding author.

Dagang oilfield \nThe Dagang oilfield complex (operated by PetroChina) lies in the Huanghua depression and covers an area of \ncirca 24 km2 in Cang County, Hebei Province (Figure 1). Exploration in the area began in 1964 and production \nstarted in the Dagang oilfields in 1968. The oil-bearing area covers 640 km2, with in total, 16 oil fields developed \nwith an estimated reserve of nearly 1.1 billion tonnes of oil. The Dagang oil reservoirs lie at depths of 1000\u20132500 m \nand have a complex and highly compartmentalised stratigraphy and structure. The main reservoir rocks in the \nDagang complex are fluvial facies of Cenozoic age, including the Dongying, Guantao and Minghuazhen groups \n(Figure 2).  \n \nThe Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration and Development, PetroChina Co. Ltd studied the reservoirs of \nthe Dagang field to assess potential for geological CO2 storage. There are several types of reservoir-trap systems \nobserved in the Dagang field; fault block condensate gas field, complex faulted block, bottom water reservoir, low \npermeability reservoir, limestone reservoir and volcanic reservoir. At the first-pass assessment for suitable storage \nsites, the limestone and volcanic reservoirs were discarded as less favourable than the clastic sedimentary reservoirs \ndue to their smaller size and lower porosities and more complex chemical reactions with CO2. The fault block \ncondensate gas fields were discarded due to conflicts of interest as PetroChina is considering these for natural gas \nstorage. The low permeability, bottom water and complex block fields were considered further. The sandstone-\ndominated Gangdong, Gangxi, Gangzhgong, Wangguantun and Shenvshi fields were studied in more detail, having \naverage porosities in the range 19-31%, permeability 18-975 mD (milli Darcies), average net pay thickness 10-22m \nand oil API 33-34 and saturation 60-65% (in Table 1).   \n \nA simplified calculation (Equation 1), using the models presented by Bachu et al. [2] in the Carbon Sequestration \nLeadership Forum (CSLF) 2007 paper, gives an effective storage capacity of approximately 77 million tonnes (Mt) \nof carbon dioxide (CO2) for the seven selected oilfields in the Dagang complex.   \n \nEffective CO2 storage = URp . FVF . \uf072 CO2r        (1) \n Where:  URp = proven ultimate recoverable oil \n  FVF = formation volume factor \n  \uf072 CO2r = CO2 density at reservoir conditions \n \n The results of storage potential calculations are given in Table 1. The Gangdong field was believed to show the \nmost potential of the selected fields, however, after calculating the storage capacity, the storage volume was only \n27.5 Mt. A fluvial environment of deposition and faulting mean the reservoirs are highly compartmentalised, \nconditions not favourable to CO2 storage. The number of wells drilled in the Dagang complex is also very large \n(spacing between boreholes is around 200m), presenting many potential leakage pathways. This also makes the \nDagang complex unfavourable for CO2 storage. There may be some opportunity to recover additional oil through \nenhanced oil recovery (EOR), however, the Dagang field is not considered suitable for large-scale storage of CO2.  \n \n3. Kailuan coalfield \nThe Kailuan coalfield lies in the north Bohai Basin and has been in operation for over 100 years. The coals of the \nKailuan field are of Carboniferous and Permian age (360-248 Ma old) and coal reserves are estimated to be 3753 \nmillion tonnes. Carbon dioxide is preferentially adsorbed by the coal, displacing coalbed methane. The effectiveness \nof this process varies with pressure (and therefore with depth). The macerals and the vitrinite reflectance of the coals \nfrom the Kailuan Coalfield which could significantly influence the CO2 adsorption were examined.  \n \nThe experimental adsorption capability of the coals with varying pressure and composition of injected CO2-CH4 \n(carbon dioxide and methane) gas was examined by the China University of Mining and Technology. Two coals of \ndifferent rank and from different depths were selected for isothermal adsorption experiments and proximate \n \"C. Vincent\" \/ Energy Procedia 1 (2010)2785\u20132792  \nanalysis; the No.11 seam Coal from the Linnancang Mine and the No.9 seam Coal from the Majiagou Mine. \nProximate analyses of the coals (moisture, ash and volatile matter) sulphur content and vitrinite reflectance were \ndetermined according to ASTM standards. Characteristics for isothermal adsorption of pure CO2, pure CH4 \n(methane) and CH4\/CO2 mixed (binary) gas were analyzed using an IS 100 isotherm instrument. Results indicated \nthe coals of the Kailuan Coalfield were of medium volatile bituminous rank. The maceral compositions and depth of \nthe two coal seams (greater than 800 m) were determined to be favourable for CO2 adsorption. \n \nExperimental adsorption isotherms of pure CH4, pure CO2 and a mixture of the two gases (binary gas) were \ndelineated for the No.11 coal from Linnancang Mine and for the No.9 coal from Majiagou Mine. As the level of \nCO2 concentration was increased in the feed gas composition, the total adsorbed gas increased for both coal \nsamples. The adsorption of CH4\/CO2 binary gas is a competitive process rather than an independent adsorption of \npure CH4 and pure CO2, thus the optimum binary gas mixture was tested experimentally. The adsorption curves of \nthe CH4\/CO2 binary gas lie above that for pure methane and below that for pure carbon dioxide. With the increase of \nCO2 concentration for feed gas compositions, the adsorbed amounts of the total gas increased for the two coals. The \nadsorption capacity of the No.9 coal from Majiagou Mine is higher than that of the No.11 coal from Linnancang \nMine. The Langmuir constant, necessary for calculation of CO2 capacity using CSLF methodology [2] was \ndetermined. The maximum adsorption of CO2 for both coal samples was 10-16 g\/cm3. Thus, for these coals, the \nvitrinite-dominated maceral composition was determined to be favourable for CO2 adsorption. \n  \nThree different methods of predicting adsorption behaviour of the binary gas mixture were applied; the extended \nLangmuir equation, ideal adsorbtion theory and numerical analysis. It was determined that for the No.11 coal from \nLinnancang Mine, the numerical analysis method theoretical results were closest to those obtained experimentally. \nHowever, for the No.9 coal from Maijiagou Mine, the results from the extended Langmuir equations more \naccurately modelled the experimental results. Comparison of these theoretical and measured figures demonstrates \nthe importance of experimental results for calculating absorption properties and estimating CO2 storage capacity for \nthe coals of the Kailuan Coalfield. However, mining continues in the Kailuan field, and potential storage sites would \nhave to be selected with care to avoid potential leakage issues or contamination of mineable coals. \n \nFurther investigation into the storage potential for the coals is being carried out. Initial results for injectivity of \nthe coals indicate that properties may be unfavourably low for large-scale storage. The Early Permian Taiyuan \nFormation coal is the most promising with porosity 3.7% and permeability 3.62mD. \n4. Jiyang Depression \nThe Jiyang Depression (figure 1) lies in the central Bohai Basin near the Shengli oilfield complex. It covers an \narea of around 20000 km2 and is divided into six sags; Huimin, Chezhen, Zhuandong, Dongying, Qingdong and \nZhanhua. This is an oil producing region and the Shengli and Gudong oilfields lie within the Jiyang super \ndepression, thus deep geological information is available in some areas. Aquifer sediments in the Jiyang Depression \nfall into five groups; Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, Eocene, Neogene (Guantao Group and Minghuazhen Group) and \nQuaternary. The Neogene aquifers are believed to have the best potential; they lie at suitable depth (greater than \n1000 m) and have a broad areal distribution and good connectivity between fault blocks. From east to west, the \nenvironment of deposition grades from flood plain to lacustrine.  \n \nThe Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences studied the potential for storage in the \nJiyang Depression. Here, the Guantao Group comprises partially cemented and fractured gravel rocks. The pore \nwater chemistry is stable; the majority contain CaCl2. On the southern and northern margins, pore water has \ncomposition NaHCO3. Overall, the general total dissolved solid (TDS) is 10-20mg\/l. The ratio of Na\/Cl in most \nareas is less than 1. The hydrochemical characteristics indicate that the groundwater flows from the margin to the \ncentre of the depression. \n \nThe Minghuazhen Group can be divided into the upper and lower deposits; the lower comprising thick mudstone \nand the upper comprising fluvial sandstones and mudstones. The Lower Minghuazhen Group could provide a \nregional cap rock for the underlying Guantao Group. The upper portion is a regional potable water source.   \n \n \"C. Vincent et al.\" \/ Energy Procedia 1 (2010) 2785\u20132792 \nMost of the oil produced is from the east Jiyang Depression. There are 50 oilfields in Zhanhua and Dongying \nsags where oil is extracted mainly from the Guantao and Shahejie formations. Thus efforts to find aquifer storage \nare being focussed on the Huimin Sag, where there are only four oilfields (Linpan, Shanghe, Yuhuangmiao and \nLinfanjia) in operation and therefore it is less likely storage would be subject to be a conflict of interest with \nhydrocarbon production and associated risks of leakage from exploration wells. \n \nThere is more uncertainty in estimation of aquifer storage potential as a result of limited data availability due to \ngeneral lack of commercial interest in deep saline aquifers. However, the Jiyang depression is a petroliferous area \nand oil and gas field data have been used to infer geological properties across this region and a crude storage \nestimate has been calculated. For the Linfanjia oilfield, the average porosity is 31% and the permeability is 392 mD \n(milliDarcies). Effective storage capacity is calculated to be 448 Mt for CO2 storage based on the agreed CSLF-\nderived calculation (Equation 3) [2]. \n \nEffective aquifer storage = A . h . \u03c6 .  \uf072 CO2r  .  Scff      (3) \n Where  A = area of regional aquifer \n  h = average height of aquifer multiplied by average net:gross ratio \n  \u03c6 = average reservoir porosity \n  \uf072 CO2r   = CO2 density at reservoir conditions \n  Scff = storage coefficient, here 0.02 is used based on results from the EU-GeoCapacity project \n \n5. Large sources of carbon dioxide \nLarge sources of CO2 (emissions greater than 100 kT\/year) were mapped in the Shandong Province to allow \nsome preliminary recommendations for source-storage matching. A GIS (Geographic Information System) \ncomprising the large point sources, infrastructure and relevant information for assessment of the geological storage \ncapacity has been created by the British Geological Survey, with the intention of aiding all project partners in \nmaking preliminary recommendations for matching geological storage options for CO2 with large sources of CO2.  \n \nTo date, Tsinghua University have catalogued 49 power stations of over 100 MW generating capacity, with \ncombined annual emissions of 121 Mt; one gas-fired plant, one oil-fired plant and 47 coal-fired plants. In addition, \n66 power plants over 50MW were catalogued with total emissions of 125 Mt\/a; one gas fired, one oil fired and 64 \ncoal-fired. The average gross coal consumption rate for these power plants was 330 gce\/kWh (grams coal equivalent \nper kW.hour).  \n  \nChinese Government policy is to close older, smaller thermal power stations and replace them with larger, more \nefficient power stations as part of a national scheme to save energy and reduce pollution. In 2007, 553 small power \nstations with a total capacity of 14.38 GigaWatts (GW) were closed across China. China intends to oversee the \ndecommissioning of small thermal power plants (with total capacity 50 GW) with replacement by larger more \nefficient plants during the period 2005 - 2010. Shandong is the leading provincial region in this shut-down drive, \nhaving closed 1 GW thermal power capacity in 2007. Shandong has over 800 coal-fired power generating units with \na capacity under 100 MW. By the end of 2010, it is planned that a further 4 GW of these small power plants will be \ndecommissioned in the Shandong Province.   \n6. Source-storage site matching \nBased on storage site potential evaluated by the COACH partners, it is considered that the Dagang oilfield is not \nsuitable for large-scale storage, though could be considered for EOR pilots. The aquifers in the Jiyang Depression \nhave a large storage potential; one option could be to route pipelines from the planned TRPI (Thermal Power \nResearch Institute) at Tianjin (south-east of Beijing) via Dagang oilfield complex for an EOR pilot, then on to the \nHuimin Depression for storage. Alternatively, the potential for enhanced coalbed methane recovery from the \nKailuan coalfield accompanied by large-scale aquifer storage in the Jiyang Depression could be considered. \n \n \"C. Vincent\" \/ Energy Procedia 1 (2010)2785\u20132792  \n7. Conclusions \nEmissions in the Shandong Province are increasing as China\u2019s economy grows. The greatest capacity for storage \nappears to lie in deep saline aquifer formations. However, the potential for \u2018value-added\u2019 options through enhanced \noil recovery in the Dagang oilfield complex or enhanced coal-bed methane recovery at Kailuan coalfield should not \nbe ignored when designing potential storage scenarios as these may offer a way to offset some of the initial outlay \nfor CCS. Unfortunately, where deep boreholes have not been drilled, aquifer properties must be inferred from \nnearby hydrocarbon fields. This results in significant uncertainty in the storage estimates for the Jiyang Depression. \nHowever, of the sites considered for the COACH project, based on the potential storage volume, this region appears \nto be the most promising for storage and worthy of further investigation.  \n8.
