INTRODUCTION\nThe electronic structure of dilute nitride alloys such as\nGaNxAs1\u2212x and GaNxP1\u2212x has attracted considerable interest,\nboth from a fundamental perspective, and also because of\ntheir potential device applications.1 Replacing a small frac-\ntion of P atoms by N introduces a series of N-related defect\nstates into the band gap of GaP, below the conduction band\nminimum. By contrast, when a small fraction of As atoms\nare replaced by N in GaAs, the energy gap initially decreases\nrapidly. This has been attributed to a band-anticrossing\n\u0001BAC\u0002 interaction between the host matrix conduction band\nedge \u0001CBE\u0002 and N-related defect levels above the CBE.2 To\ndate, most interest has focused on dilute nitride arsenide and\nphosphide alloys, with comparatively little analysis under-\ntaken of the dilute nitride antimonide alloys, InNxSb1\u2212x and\nGaNxSb1\u2212x.\nInSb has the smallest energy gap of any III-V semicon-\nductor, and it has been proposed3 and demonstrated4 that the\naddition of N to form InNSb can give a zero-gap semicon-\nductor. GaNSb is also being considered as a potential emitter\nfor wavelengths both at and beyond the 1.5 \u0001m telecommu-\nnication range.5 We use the tight-binding method we have\npreviously established for GaNAs \u0001Ref. 6\u0002 and GaNP \u0001Ref.\n7\u0002 to investigate here the band structure of dilute InNxSb1\u2212x\nand GaNxSb1\u2212x alloys. It is well established that N-related\ndefect states are found below the lower of the X- and\nL-related conduction band levels in GaAs, InAs, and GaP.\nWe show here that this is also the case in InSb and GaSb.\nBecause there is a large separation between these levels and\nthe \u0002 conduction band minimum in InSb, we find that the\nN-related defect levels tend to be well above the CBE in\nInNSb. A comparison to the tight-binding calculations pre-\nsented here shows that the two-level BAC model initially\nintroduced to describe the band gap variation in GaNAs\ngives a good description of the dependence both of the en-\nergy gap and of the conduction band dispersion on N com-\nposition in InNSb. By contrast, the lowest X- and L-related\nconduction band states are closer to the \u0002 conduction band\nminimum in GaSb than is the case in any of GaAs, InAs, or\nInSb. Our calculations show that the band structure of\nGaNSb is intermediate between that of GaAs and GaP. We\nfind that N-related defect levels occur both above and below\nthe CBE in GaSb: the large number of lower-energy N states\nlead to a strongly disordered band structure close to the CBE\nin GaNSb.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The sp3s* tight-binding\nHamiltonian which we use is described in Sec. II, with the\nmain results then presented in Sec. III. Because disorder\nplays such an important role, we present 1728-atom supercell\ncalculations, investigating the lowest conduction band states\nboth as a function of increasing N composition \u00030%\u0003x\n\u00031.7% \u00013.8%\u0002 for InSb \u0001GaSb\u0002\u0004 and also as a function of\nincreasing short range correlations in the N distribution. We\nfind for InSb that such correlations have relatively little ef-\nfect on the conduction band minimum, but that the assumed\ndistribution of N atoms strongly influences the results of the\nGaNSb supercell calculations. We then discuss the conse-\nquences of our calculations for randomly disordered InNSb\nand GaNSb alloys, with the summary and conclusions of our\nwork presented in Sec. IV.\nII. DETAILS OF TIGHT-BINDING MODEL\nTo investigate the electronic structure of various alloy\nstructures, we use an sp3s* nearest-neighbor tight-binding\n\u0001TB\u0002 Hamiltonian which takes explicit account of the imme-\ndiate environment. We conduct our calculations on super-\ncells, in which all atomic positions have been relaxed to their\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 165205 \u00012008\u0002\n1098-0121\/2008\/77\u000116\u0002\/165205\u000110\u0002 \u00a92008 The American Physical Society165205-1\nequilibrium values using the GULP molecular relaxation\npackage8 and a parametrized valence force field model,9,10\nwhile using V\u00e9gard\u2019s law to vary the unit cell basis vectors\nas a\u0001x\u0002=xaXN+ \u00011\u2212x\u0002aXSb \u0001X=In,Ga\u0002. In this model, we\nused the Keating9 bond-stretching \u0001\u0004\u0002 and bond-bending \u0001\u0005\u0002\nforce constants of Ref. 10 for InSb \u0001\u0004=29.61 N \/m and \u0005\n=4.77 N \/m\u0002 and GaSb \u0001\u0004=33.16 N \/m and \u0005=7.22 N \/m\u0002\nand of Ref. 11 for InN \u0001\u0004=79.20 N \/m and \u0005=7.10 N \/m\u0002\nand GaN \u0001\u0004=96.30 N \/m and \u0005=14.80 N \/m\u0002. For the\nN-III-Sb three-body bond-bending terms, we simply take the\naverage of the two relevant values of \u0005. Previous work on\nGaAsN has shown that the relaxed bond lengths calculated\nusing this approach are in good agreement with those ob-\ntained from ab initio calculations.12 The on-site orbital ener-\ngies for each atom are determined by taking an average of\nthe corresponding value in each binary compound made up\nby the given atom and its four nearest neighbors, with a\nfurther minor adjustment due to changes in the next-nearest-\nneighbor shell. For the interatomic interaction energies, we\ntake the values for the two atoms in the equivalent binary\ncompound and adjust for lattice distortion: the interaction\nenergies are assumed to vary as \u0001d0 \/d\u0002n, where d0 is the\nequilibrium bond length in the binary compound, d is the\nbond length after relaxation in the alloy, and n is a scaling\nexponent, which can take a different value for each type of\norbital combination. The effects of changes in bond angle are\ntaken into account by using the two-center integral expres-\nsions of Slater and Koster.13 The scaling indices are deter-\nmined by fitting the bond length dependence of the InSb,\nInN, GaSb, and GaN nearest-neighbor interaction parameters\nto a range of their respective hydrostatic deformation\npotentials.6 The self-energy and interatomic interaction pa-\nrameters used in the model are taken from Vogl14 in the case\nof InSb and GaSb, while those for InN and GaN were de-\nrived by fitting to data from pseudopotential band structure\ncalculations of the zincblende structures.12,15\nTable I lists the tight-binding parameters used for the bi-\nnary compounds, while Table II shows the calculated indices\nn\u0004\u0005 used to describe the distance dependence of the inter-\natomic interactions between orbitals \u0004 and \u0005 on neighboring\natoms.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe two-level BAC model explained the extreme band\ngap bowing observed in GaNxAs1\u2212x in terms of an interaction\nbetween two levels: one at energy Ec associated with the\nextended CBE state \bc0 of the GaAs matrix and the other at\nenergy EN associated with the localized N impurity states \bN,\nwith the two states linked by a matrix element VNc describing\nthe interaction between them.2 The CBE energy E\n\u2212\nof\nGaNxAs1\u2212x is then given by the lower eigenvalue of the de-\nterminant\n\u0005EN \u2212 E VNc\nVNc Ec \u2212 E\n\u0005 , \u00011\u0002\nwith the magnitude of the interaction matrix element varying\nwith N composition x as x1\/2, VNc=\u0005x1\/2. In this model, the\ninteraction matrix element VNc mixes N-like character into\nthe CBE level and also mixes CBE \u0002 character into a higher-\nlying state E+, with the energies of the states E\u2212 and E+ then\ngiven by\nE\t =\nEN + Ec\n2\n\t\u0006\u0007EN \u2212 Ec2 \b\n2\n+ VNc\n2\n, \u00012\u0002\nand with the alloy CBE wave function given by \b\n\u2212\n=\u0004c\bc0\n+\u0004N\bN, where \u0004c\n2+\u0004N\n2\n=1.\nThe fractional \u0002 character f\u0002=\u0004c2 of the E\u2212 state provides\na useful measure of how much the N-related states perturb\nthe CBE wave function.23 From the k \u00b7p method, the effec-\ntive mass at the CBE increases with increasing energy gap\nand is inversely proportional to the modulus squared of the\nmomentum matrix element linking the CBE state with the\nvalence band zone center states. Mixing N character into the\nE\n\u2212\nstate reduces this matrix element, and the alloy conduc-\ntion band edge effective mass m\nalloy\n* is then inversely depen-\ndent on the magnitude of f\u0002.25\nIn practice, the two-level BAC model provides only an\nidealized description of the CBE state in GaNAs because it\nignores the distribution of N-related defect states in the alloy.\nIt is well established that when a single N atom replaces an\nAs atom in GaAs, it forms a resonant defect level above the\nconduction band edge of GaAs.26,27 However, the alloy can\nalso contain clusters of N atoms, such as N-N nearest-\nneighbor pairs, where a single Ga atom has two N neighbors\n\u0003denoted by N2\u0001110\u0002\u0004, as well as larger clusters, some ex-\namples of which are depicted in Fig. 1. There are in total five\ndifferent types of three-atom clusters: three of these intro-\nduce a defect level below the lower energy N2\u0001110\u0002 level,\nwhile strain relaxation in the other two cases causes the low-\nest cluster defect level to be above this level.28 Figure 1\nillustrates the three types of 3N atom clusters which give rise\nto the lower energy defect levels, as well as an example of\none 4N atom cluster, which introduces a defect level below\nthe three-atom cluster levels. In a random alloy, the number\nof such clusters markedly increases with increasing N com-\nposition, with the detail of the cluster distribution strongly\ninfluencing the alloy conduction band dispersion.23,28,29\nTo investigate the role of N in InNSb and GaNSb alloys,\nwe have used the TB Hamiltonian described in the previous\nsection to calculate the band structure of a range of different\n1728-atom X864NMSb864\u2212M supercells \u0001X=Ga, In\u0002, with four\ndifferent configurations \u0001i=1\u20134\u0002 of N atoms considered for\neach nitrogen composition M. Previous work on ultralarge\nGaNxAs1\u2212x supercells containing a statistical distribution of\nN atoms calculated using the TB based linear combination of\nisolated N states \u0001LCINS\u0002 model23 has shown that aside from\nisolated N atoms the five N complexes in Fig. 1 have the\nmost important effect on the CBE as a function of x because\nof their energy relative to the isolated level and also to the\nCBE. Table IV lists the average number of isolated N atoms\nand of each of these clusters expected in a 1728-atom super-\ncell for the different N compositions studied. It can be seen\nthat it is impossible to exactly reproduce the average cluster\ncomposition in a single supercell calculation. The five N\ncomplexes from Fig. 1 are therefore introduced in various\nconcentrations in each configuration. Table V lists the differ-\nent In864NMSb864\u2212M supercells considered, with M =3, 6, 10,\nand 14, to investigate the evolution of band structure with N\nconcentration x up to x=1.62%. The calculations were then\nrepeated for Ga864NMSb864\u2212M for M =3, 6, 14 and 32 \u0001x\nTABLE IV.

For\neach value of M, the label i=1 refers to the supercell with\nthe smallest number of N clusters included in the calculation:\nonly isolated N atoms and second and\/or further neighbor\npairs are included for i=1 in all cases other than for M =32.\nWe define an isolated N atom \u0001denoted N1\u0002 as one where\nthere are no N atoms occupying any one of its \u00011,1,0\u0002 second\nneighbor sites; i.e., all 12 of its second nearest neighbors are\nhost group-V atoms. The energy of an isolated N atom can\nbe perturbed by other N atoms which are close by, but which\nare not immediate second neighbors. To monitor the effect of\nthese more distant interactions, we also note in Table V the\nminimum separation between N atoms in each structure\nwhere only isolated N atoms are included. Increasing num-\nbers of larger N clusters are included with increasing i,\nthrough to i=4 having the greatest number of larger N clus-\nters. The clusters include the N2\u0001110\u0002 clusters depicted in\nFig. 1\u0001a\u0002 and, depending on M, an increasing number of 3N\nclusters \u0003depicted in Figs. 1\u0001b\u0002\u20131\u0001d\u0002\u0004 and \u0001for M =32, x\n=3.70% only\u0002 a 4N cluster of the type depicted in Fig. 1\u0001e\u0002.\nOur calculations are set up so that the random alloy distribu-\ntion lies closest to that assumed for i=1 and i=2. Table V\nsummarizes the specifications of the supercell configurations\nconsidered in this work, the band structures of which are\npresented in Figs. 2 and 3.\nFigures 2 and 3 show, respectively, the calculated conduc-\ntion band structure of the different InNSb and GaNSb super-\ncells considered. We also include for comparison at the bot-\ntom left of each figure the band structure of the host binary\ncompounds InSb and GaSb. The right hand panel for each\nvalue of i and M shows the band dispersion calculated along\nthe kz direction between the supercell zone center and Bril-\nlouin zone edge. The left hand panel shows how the host \u00021c\nstate, \bc0, is distributed over the alloy states j at the \u0002 point,\nwith\nf\u0002\u0001j\u0002 = \t\n\b j\t\bc0\u000b\t2. \u00013\u0002\nWe consider first the influence of isolated N atoms on the\nband dispersion in the ultradilute alloys. Figure 2 \u0001M =3, i\n=1\u0002 shows that the inclusion of three isolated N atoms into a\n1728-atom supercell \u0001x=0.35% \u0002 introduces three N-related\nlevels centered around 0.75 eV above the valence band\nmaximum and therefore lying \f0.55 eV above the CBE.\nThis is twice the energy separation of \f0.25\u20130.30 eV be-\ntween the isolated N level and the CBE in GaNAs. There is\na small 30 meV reduction in the CBE energy E\n\u2212\nof the alloy\ncompared to that of InSb \u0003Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The CBE is only\nslightly perturbed from that of InSb, retaining over 95% host\n\u00021c character \u0003Fig. 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004. The calculated effective mass is\nslightly lower than that of InSb due to the reduction in en-\nergy gap more than compensating for the reduced CBE \u00021c\ncharacter \u0003Fig. 4\u0001c\u0002\u0004. The three levels centered at \f0.75 eV\noriginate from a combination of three highly localized s-like\nimpurity states, each associated with one of the N atoms.\nOne of these levels \u0003identified with E+ in Eq. \u00012\u0002\u0004 is shifted\nupward to a slightly higher energy and has around 5% \u00021c\ncharacter. This level is made up of a symmetric combination\nof the s-like impurity states centered on each N atom, which\ninteract with the host \u00021c state to give the E+ state.\nTurning to GaNSb \u0003Fig. 3 \u0001M =3, i=1\u0002\u0004, we again see that\nthe introduction of a small number of isolated N atoms leads\nto the formation of localized defect levels in GaSb, similar to\nthose in GaNAs and InNSb, and which have a similar though\nmore dramatic effect on the CBE. The key change is in the\nrelative positioning of the N levels and the CBE in GaNSb.\nThe isolated N level is calculated to be almost degenerate\nwith and to have a large interaction matrix element with the\nGaSb CBE. This can be clearly seen in Fig. 3 \u0001M =3, i=1\u0002,\nwhere two closely spaced N levels are found at 0.77 eV,\nwhile the symmetric combination of localized N states\nstrongly interacts with the host CBE to give approximately\nequal f\u0002 character on the alloy CBE state \u0001E\u2212\u0002 and on the E+\nlevel. We therefore find a strong redshift in the CBE energy,\nwith \f50% drop in f\u0002 and an almost 50% enhancement in\nthe band edge mass \u0001Fig. 4\u0002. Here, in contrast to InSb, the\nreduction in f\u0002 is then the dominant factor contributing to the\nchange in effective mass.\nWe next consider the dependence of the band structure on\nthe density of isolated N levels. Moving down the i=1 series\nin Fig. 2, we see classical BAC behavior as the number of\nTABLE V.

We see that the interaction between the two N\natoms starts to perturb the distribution of N-related defect\nlevels, with the introduction of two new defect levels, which\ncan be described as a symmetric \u0003N2\n+\u0001220\u0002\u0004 and an antisym-\nmetric \u0003N2\n\u2212\u0001220\u0002\u0004 combination of the isolated N defect levels.\nFinally, we see from M =3, i=4 the effect of introducing an\nisolated N atom and a N-N pair \u0003N2\u0001110\u0002, Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004 into the\nsupercell. The N2\u0001110\u0002 pair introduces two defect levels,\nwith even \u0001\f\u0002 and odd \u0001\r\u0002 symmetries, which are related to\nthe levels in Fig. 2 \u0001M =3, i=4\u0002 at 0.54 and 0.84 eV, respec-\ntively, and at 0.50 and 0.85 eV, respectively, in Fig. 3 \u0001M\n=3, i=4\u0002. For InNSb, the introduction of this N-N pair has\nlittle influence on the band dispersion near the CBE, with\nlittle observed change in energy gap or CBE effective mass.\nThe concentration of N-N pairs in supercell \u0001M =3, i=4\u0002 is\naround an order of magnitude greater than what would be\nexpected in a random alloy with x=0.34% so that the two-\nlevel BAC model should remain appropriate to describe the\nCBE in this case. By contrast, the introduction of a N2\u0001110\u0002\npair strongly modifies the band structure of GaNSb near to\nthe conduction band minimum. There is now significant \u0002\ncharacter on two of the lower-lying conduction levels in Fig.\n3 \u0001M =3, i=4\u0002, the lower of which has also strong N2\n+\u0001110\u0002\ncharacter. As a result the CBE cannot be fitted to a two-level\nBAC model in this case. Statistically, we would expect far\nfewer N2\u0001110\u0002 pairs in a random GaNSb alloy for x\n=0.34%, but given that the pair states determine the lowest\nconduction levels in Fig. 3 \u0001M =3, i=3,4\u0002, they will still\nstrongly modify the band structure and must be explicitly\nincluded in any model of the electronic properties of this\nalloy.\nIn a random alloy, the number and average size of N\nclusters increases with increasing N composition x. Consid-\nering the i=4 series, which contains the highest proportion of\nN clusters at each x, we observe in Figs. 2 and 3 an increas-\ning number of new levels appearing below the isolated N\nlevel due to the introduction of larger N clusters with in-\ncreasing N concentration \u0001increasing x\u0002. We see in Fig. 2 that\nbecause of the large energy separation between the isolated\nN-related levels and the CBE, the lower energy states asso-\nciated with the N clusters do not in general have a significant\neffect on the InNSb CBE. Figure 4\u0001a\u0002 shows that the CBE\nenergy smoothly decreases with increasing N composition x\nfor the different structures considered in Fig. 2. This is also\ntrue for the fractional \u0002 character f\u0002 and for the CBE effec-\ntive mass \u0003Figs. 4\u0001a\u0002 and 4\u0001b\u0002\u0004. Of the 16 structures consid-\nered, there are only two cases where a N-related defect level\nhas a significant influence on the CBE energy and its f\u0002\ncharacter, namely, M =6 and M =14 \u0001both i=4\u0002, where the\nN3\n+\u0001C\u0002 level at about 0.42 eV and the N3\n+\u0001A\u0002 level at 0.26 eV,\nrespectively, strongly mix with the CBE state, reducing its \u0002\ncharacter, and pushing the CBE to lower energy compared to\nthe other structures considered. For both cases, the number\nof N3 clusters in the 1728-atom supercell is at least an order\nof magnitude greater than would be expected in a random\nalloy. We therefore expect these states to have a much\nweaker effect near the conduction band minimum in a ran-\ndom alloy. The two-level BAC model should therefore pro-\nvide a good description of the variation with composition x\nof the CBE energy and the band edge effective mass in\nInNxSb1\u2212x.\nThis conclusion is supported by the available experimen-\ntal data. There have been relatively little data reported con-\ncerning the dependence of the energy gap on N composition\nx in InNxSb1\u2212x. Part of the difficulty in determining the band\ngap is that both InSb and InNxSb1\u2212x tend to have a large\nintrinsic electron concentration4 so that the Moss-Burstein\nshift then makes it difficult to determine the fundamental\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nf \u0393\ni=1\ni=2\ni=3\ni=4\n0 1 2 3 4\nx, Nitrogen composition (%)\n0\n1\n2\n3\nm\n* a\nllo\ny\n\/m\n* h\nos\nt\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n\u2206E\n\u2212\n(e\nV\n)\nRef. 30\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFIG. 4. \u0001Color online\u0002 Variation of the E\n\u2212\n\u0001a\u0002 energy \u0001relative to\nhost CBE\u0002, \u0001b\u0002 fractional \u00021c character, and \u0001c\u0002 effective mass in the\nIn864NMiSb864\u2212Mi \u0001continuous line\u0002 and Ga864NMiSb864\u2212Mi \u0001dashed\nline\u0002 band structures of Figs. 2 and 3.

We estimated above that the incorporation of N\ninto InNSb will lead to a zero-gap semiconductor for x\u000e\n\f2.7% at T=0 K. A zero-gap band structure has been re-\nported for InNxSb1\u2212x with x=6%, with the conduction band\nminimum estimated to be \f255 meV below the valence\nband maximum at room temperature at this composition.\nThese numbers are consistent with our analysis here. The\nconduction band dispersion has also been measured by cy-\nclotron resonance in pulsed magnetic fields up to 150 T, al-\nlowing the dispersion to be probed over a wide energy\nrange.31 These results directly demonstrated the band anti-\ncrossing, with the measured results in good quantitative\nagreement with theoretical calculations for a value of x\n\u00031%. Overall, we conclude that the two-level BAC model is\ntherefore appropriate to describe the conduction band disper-\nsion in InNxSb1\u2212x.\nBy contrast, Figs. 3 and 4 show that the two-level BAC\nmodel of Eq. \u00011\u0002 is not appropriate to describe the band\ndispersion in GaNSb. We saw in Fig. 3 \u0001M =3, i=1\u0002 that the\nisolated N defect level is almost degenerate with the GaSb\nCBE energy at T=0 K. Because the N cluster state levels lie\nbelow the GaSb CBE energy, we find that the specific distri-\nbution of N levels then strongly influences the calculated\nCBE energy and effective mass for the GaNxSb1\u2212x supercell\nstructures considered in Fig. 3. The GaNSb results presented\nin Figs. 3 and 4 include the case of x=3.70% to investigate\nthe band structure for a GaNSb alloy whose energy gap is\nclose to that of InSb. This higher N composition leads to an\nincreased number of larger N clusters in a random alloy. We\nfind that there is strong hybridization between the host band\nstates and pair and\/or cluster defect levels lying close to the\nband edge over the full range of x considered here. For each\ncomposition, the calculated energy gap and its f\u0002 character\nstrongly depend on the assumed distribution of N atoms.\nThe square red data points in Fig. 4\u0001a\u0002 compare the mea-\nsured room temperature change in the energy gap of a series\nof GaNxSb1\u2212x epilayers30 with the calculated variation of the\nCBE energy in our tight-binding calculations. The valence\nband edge Ev approximately shifts upward as Ev=Ev0\n+0.13x eV in our calculations. The experimental energy gaps\nhave consequently been shifted by 0.13x eV to compare to\nthe calculated variation in the CBE energy. The calculated\nand measured shifts are of comparable magnitude over the\nlimited composition range for which there are experimental\ndata available. The strong hybridization between N cluster\nlevels and the conduction band edge will have significant\nconsequences for the electronic and optical properties of\nGaNSb. We estimate below that there will be an order of\nmagnitude more N resonant states close to the CBE in\nGaNSb compared to GaNAs. The N cluster states contribute\nto the observed inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption\nspectrum in GaNAs \u0001Ref. 32\u0002 and also contribute to the\nstrong carrier localization effects observed at low tempera-\nture in microphotoluminescence experiments.33 These effects\nshould be even more dramatic in the case of GaNSb. In\naddition, the N resonant states severely limit the electron\nmobility in GaNAs,34 giving an intrinsic electron mobility of\norder 100 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. The high density of N clusters in\nGaNSb should have an even stronger effect on the mobility.\nIt has been proposed that the low electron mobility and high\nelectron mass could make GaNAs particularly suited as the\nmultiplication region in avalanche photodiodes operating at\ntelecommunication wavelengths.35 This should also be the\ncase for GaNSb. Overall, we conclude that defect levels as-\nsociated with N clusters will play a dominant role in deter-\nmining the lowest conduction band structure of GaNSb, lead-\ning to strong inhomogeneous broadening of the band edge,\nand a low electron mobility.23,29,34\nThe calculations presented here and previous work on\nGaNAs show that there are two main factors which deter-\nmine the extent of hybridization between the host band states\nand pair and\/or cluster defect levels that lie close to the band\nedge:\n\u0001a\u0002 the energy levels of some basic key N clusters and\nwhere they lie in relation to the initial CBE energy and\n\u0001b\u0002 the rate at which the CBE moves down in energy with\nx.\nIn GaNAs for example, which has properties intermediate\nbetween those of InNSb and GaNSb, the CBE passes\nthrough the N2\n+\u0001110\u0002 level at low temperatures at x\f0.2%.\nWe estimate a concentration x2 of N2\u0001110\u0002 pairs at this com-\nposition of x2\r2\n10\u22123% using the approximation for a ran-\ndom alloy that x2\r6x2. We calculate that the CBE then\npasses through the N3\n+\u0001C\u0002 level at x\f0.8%, for which com-\nposition x3\u0001C\u0002\r1\n10\u22123% \u0003where we assume the concentra-\ntion of N3\u0001C\u0002 clusters, x3\u0001C\u0002, varies as 24x3\u0004, and passes\nthrough the N3\n+\u0001B\u0002 level at x\f2%, where x3\u0001B\u0002\r5\n\n10\u22123% \u0003using x3\u0001B\u0002\r6x3\u0004, before finally passing through\nthe N3\n+\u0001A\u0002 level at x\f4%, where x3\u0001A\u0002\r0.03% \u0003using\nx3\u0001A\u0002\r4x3\u0004. These different N cluster levels then lead to a\nwell-defined nonmonotonic variation of the measured low\ntemperature CBE mass with increasing N composition in\nGaNxAs1\u2212x. For InNSb, we calculate that the N2\n+\u0001110\u0002 level\nlies \f0.3 eV above the host CBE, and therefore has little\ninfluence on the CBE mass for any x. Of the states which\nwere key to determine the band edge mass in GaNAs, we\ncalculate that only the N3\n+\u0001A\u0002 level initially lies below the\nInSb CBE in the band gap, shifting into the conduction band\nat x\f0.3%. At this composition, the concentration of N3\u0001A\u0002\nclusters is only x3\r1\n10\u22125% in a random alloy. This is\nabout 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the concentration\nof N2\u0001110\u0002 pairs in GaNAs at a similar x. Hence, we con-\nclude that the band dispersion of InNSb should be well de-\nscribed by a two-level BAC model, with N cluster states\nhaving little effect on the observed band structure at the con-\nduction band minimum.\nBy contrast, if we use the two-level BAC parameters de-\nrived from Fig. 3 \u0001i=1\u0002 then the GaNSb CBE passes through\nthe N2\n+\u0001110\u0002, N3\n+\u0001C\u0002, N3\n+\u0001B\u0002, and N3\n+\u0001A\u0002 levels at x\f1.2%,\n2.2%, 3.3%, and 4.4%, respectively. At these compositions,\nwe calculate x2\r0.09%, x3\u0001C\u0002\r0.03%, x3\u0001B\u0002\r0.02%, and\nx3\u0001A\u0002\r0.03%. These concentrations are generally an order\nof magnitude larger than the corresponding ones in GaNAs.\nWe conclude therefore that the CBE character of GaNSb will\nbe dominated by the presence of N-related defect levels.\nThese will mix strongly with the GaSb host \u0002 conduction\nband states and should give a broad series of optically active\ndefect-related transitions. We conclude that the electronic\nproperties of GaNSb will be intermediate between those of\nGaNAs, where a small number of N-related cluster states are\nLINDSAY et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW B 77, 165205 \u00012008\u0002\n165205-8\napproximately degenerate with the CBE, and GaNP, where\nthe electronic properties are dominated by an increasing den-\nsity of N-related defect states below the conduction band\nminimum.\nFinally, we note the effect that nitrogen has on the upper\nvalence bands of InNSb and GaNSb. We see from Figs. 2\nand 3 that the heavy-hole valence band remains largely un-\naffected by N for both InNSb and GaNSb. However, it is\nevident from Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 \u0001for M =32\u0002 that the light-hole\n\u0001LH\u0002 valence band is significantly affected by the introduc-\ntion of N. Because InSb is a narrow band gap semiconductor,\nthe effect of reducing the band gap through the introduction\nof nitrogen is both to modify the LH band edge effective\nmass and also to increase significantly the nonparabolicity of\nthe LH band. This change in LH dispersion is expected to\nmodify the energy dependence of loss mechanisms such as\nAuger recombination36 and so must be taken into account in\nmodels of InNSb-based materials and devices. This can be\nachieved by extending the standard eight-band k \u00b7p model to\na ten-band k \u00b7p model that includes the coupling between the\nnitrogen levels and the conduction band edge.6,37 For\nGaNSb, high concentrations of nitrogen also significantly\nmodify the LH band dispersion. However, it is more difficult\nto model this effect with a modified k \u00b7p model due to the\nstrong dependence of the conduction band structure on the\nassumed N distribution.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nIn summary, the electronic structure of various InNxSb1\u2212x\nand GaNxSb1\u2212x alloys \u0001x\u000f3.7% \u0002 has been presented and\ndiscussed in detail. We find that N-related defect levels will\ngenerally lie well above the conduction band minimum in\nInNSb, with the band dispersion of InNSb then well de-\nscribed by a two-level band-anticrossing model. We estimate\nthat the incorporation of N in an ideal InNSb alloy should\nallow a zero-gap III-V semiconductor for x\u000b2.7% at low\ntemperature. By contrast, the calculated electronic structure\nof GaNxSb1\u2212x supercells strongly depends on the assumed\ndistribution of N atoms within the supercell, with N-related\ndefect levels strongly perturbing the lowest conduction band\nstates and energy gap. This should lead to strong inhomoge-\nneous broadening and localization effects due to N-related\ndefect levels close to the conduction band minimum in\nGaNSb. Overall, we find that details of the lowest conduc-\ntion band states in dilute nitride alloys are dominated by the\nrelative energy of the N-related defect levels and the host\nmatrix conduction band edge. We conclude that the distribu-\ntion of N states has an increasingly large effect as the states\nshift down in energy relative to the host matrix CBE on\ngoing from InSb to GaAs to GaSb and finally to GaP.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was funded by the Electro-Magnetic Remote\nSensing \u0001EMRS\u0002 Defence Technology Centre.
