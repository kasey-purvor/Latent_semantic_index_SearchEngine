It is central to adolescence that teenagers learn to anticipate and \ncope with risk \u2013 in short, to become resilient. In this article, we inquire into children and \nteenagers\u2019 responses after they have experienced online content or contact risks. Pan-\nEuropean findings show that especially in Northern European countries with high internet \naccess, parental perception of likelihood of online risk to their child is negatively associated \nwith their perceived ability to cope. A comparison of representative surveys conducted \namong children in three relatively \u2018high risk\u2019 countries (Norway, Ireland and the United \nKingdom) found that although the frequency of exposure to perceived online risks, especially \ncontent risks, is fairly high, most children adopt positive (e.g. seek help from friends) or, more \ncommonly, neutral (e.g. ignoring the experience) strategies to cope, although a minority \nexacerbate the risks (e.g. passing risky content on to friends). Most strategies tend to \nexclude adult involvement. Significant differences in both risk and coping are found by \ngender and age across these countries, pointing to different styles of youthful risk \nmanagement. \u00a0\n \nKeywords    Children; internet; risk; parenting; coping; resilience \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\n \nAccompanying the rapid rise in domestic internet use during the past decade, concerns \nabout children\u2019s exposure to risk of harm online have become a familiar part of the public \ndiscourse in Western societies. While children are popularly perceived as techno-savvy users \nand innovators in terms of education, communication and creativity  (although see Facer & \nFurlong, 2001), when it comes to risks they are instead portrayed as potential victims in an \nAristotelian state of tabula rasa, vulnerable to the wide array of harmful contents and contacts \nafforded by the internet. This presents policy makers, parents and teachers with a dilemma: \non the one hand, there is considerable government and industry-led impetus behind the \nfurther promotion of the internet, but on the other hand, enthusiasm for the benefits this may \nfacilitate is tempered by anxieties regarding the prospects for minimizing the attendant risks. \nAttempts to resolve this dilemma by either ignoring the risks or, conversely, by \nrestricting children\u2019s online opportunities (whether by limiting their access to the internet or by \ncontrolling their activities) are unsatisfactory. More subtle solutions are required, especially \nsince research suggests that those who experience more online opportunities also \nexperience more risks, and that reducing online risk may restrict online opportunities \n(Livingstone & Helsper, 2009). Solutions may include state or industry self-regulation, \nawareness-raising among parents, teacher training or \u2013 the focus of this article \u2013 supporting \nand guiding the coping responses of children themselves. \nDeliberations regarding online risk echo wider debates regarding risk in childhood \n(Jackson & Scott, 1999). Defining risk as \u2018the possibility that human actions or events lead to \nconsequences that harm aspects of things that human beings value\u2019 (Klinke & Renn, 2002, p. \n1071), distinguishes risk assessment (calculating risk probability and magnitude), risk \nevaluation (determining the acceptability of a given risk) and risk management (the process \nof reducing risks to a level deemed tolerable by society). All three processes are important, \nbut when it comes to children, risk management is impeded by apparent public reluctance to \ntolerate any risk whatsoever.  \nDissenting voices are beginning to counter this risk-averse approach, so that while one \nset of pressures (media panics, growing litigation, conservative  regulations) pushes society \ntowards a highly protective, even over-protective approach to children, there is growing \nresistance to the restrictions this imposes on children\u2019s autonomy, privacy and freedoms (Gill, \n2007; Madge & Barker, 2007). Theorized in terms of \u2018resilience to risk\u2019, this approach argues \nthat children must learn for themselves how to navigate the wider world, including learning \nfrom their mistakes and recovering from accidents, for \u2018resilience can only develop through \nexposure to risk or to stress\u2019 (Coleman & Hagell, 2007, p. 15).  \n\u2018Coping\u2019 refers to behaviour that protects people from being psychologically harmed by \nrisky experiences (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). Little is known of how teenagers cope with \nonline risk, although see Frydenberg et al. (2003) and Coleman and Hagell (2007) on \nadolescent coping, Reyna and Farley (2006) on adolescents\u2019 anticipation of and responses \nto risk, and Spitzberg and Hoobler (2002) for adult coping with online risk. In relation to \ntelevision, Buckingham (1996) argued that children can be shocked, fearful or upset but they \nlearn to cope by choosing content that is a little but not much too old for them and by \nrealizing that their emotional responses do not last. However, Cantor (2002) found that \nchildren\u2019s fear responses to television can persist into adulthood, with continued nightmares, \navoidance practices and anxiety. Qualitative work suggests that some shrug off experiences \nthat for others are distressing, although it may be that some are more reluctant to report \ndistress (Nightingale, Dickenson, & Griff, 2000).  \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nWhile claims about television may apply to the internet, online risks are more diverse \nand the associated harms are potentially more extreme; moreover children are less \namenable to parental mediation, being widely regarded as the online \u2018experts\u2019 (Livingstone, \n2008). Questions regarding children\u2019s responses to online risk are increasingly pertinent. To \nwhat degree can children themselves be expected to cope with risk on the internet? How \nmuch exposure to risk, under what circumstances, might engender resilience rather than \nharm? How do adolescents make decisions in relation to anticipated risks (Reyna & Farley, \n2006)? And when should adults intervene, given adolescents\u2019 tendency towards risk-taking \nactivities (Hope, 2007; Slater, 2003)? To date, such questions have been barely addressed.  \nRather, following mass adoption of the internet in homes across Europe, North America \nand many parts of Asia, empirical research has mainly focused on the identification and \npossible prevention of risk \u2013 mapping what different children do online and whether and \nwhen they are exposed to various kinds of risk (Staksrud, Livingstone, & Haddon, 2007). A \nnumber of studies are prominent in this tradition: UK Children Go Online (Livingstone & \nBober, 2004), Eurobarometer (2006), the Safety, Awareness, Facts and Tools (SAFT) 2003 \nand 2006 surveys (Staksrud, 2005; Staksrud, 2008b), the Youth Internet Safety Survey of \n2000 and 2006 (Finkelhor, Mitchell, & Wolak, 2000; Wolak, Mitchell, & Finkelhor, 2006) and \nthe Young Canadians in a WiredWorld survey, conducted in 2001 and 2005 (ERIN Research \nInc., 2005; Media Awareness Network, 2001)  (see also Australian Broadcasting Authority & \nNetAlert Ltd, 2005; Lenhart, 2007; Liau, Khoo, & Ang, 2005; Smith, 2007).  \nIn this article, we review the nature and incidence of online risk before focusing on the \nnew challenge of children\u2019s coping. We then compare findings from the SAFT and UKCGO \nprojects conducted in Norway, Ireland and the UK, setting these in the context of pan-\nEuropean findings to ask what children do after exposure to risk. Specifically, two research \nquestions are explored in relation to a variety of content and contact risks: (1) how do \nchildren feel and (2) what do children do having encountered online risks? \nWhat risks do which children encounter online? \nBy tackling some difficult issues of research ethics and design (Lobe, Livingstone, & Haddon, \n2007), researchers over the past decade have achieved three main tasks: an analysis of  the \nlandscape of online risk; a scoping of risk incidence by age and gender; and a collaboration \nwith policy makers and safety awareness initiatives to translate evidence into policy \noutcomes. Research has made less progress in addressing the difficult but important relation \nbetween risk (measured through surveys of children\u2019s risky experiences) and harm (e.g. \nmeasured through clinical or criminal reports (Millwood Hargrave & Livingstone, 2009)). Nor \nhas it examined how children respond to risky experiences.  \nNotwithstanding definitional debates, online risks are generally taken to include a \nheterogeneous set of intended and unintended experiences which increase the likelihood of \nharm to the internet user: these include encountering pornographic, self-harm, violent, racist \nor hateful contents online, inappropriate or potentially harmful contact via grooming1 or \nharassment, and, attracting recent attention, problematic conduct among peers such as \nbullying, \u2018happy slapping\u2019 or privacy invasions. One may distinguish content risks (where the \nchild is a recipient of unwelcome or inappropriate mass communication), contact risks (where \nthe child participates in risky peer or personal communication), and conduct risks (where the \nchild acts themselves to contribute to risky content or contact). Risks can be further \ncategorized in terms of the motivations of those who originate online information or \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\ncommunication, resulting in the classification shown in Table 1 (Hasebrink, Livingstone, & \nHaddon, 2008).  \n \nTable 1: A classification of online risks to children \n Commercial Aggressive Sexual Values \nContent \n- child as \nrecipient \nAdvertising, \nspam, \nsponsorship \nViolent\/ \nhateful \ncontent \nPornographic \nor unwelcome \nsexual \ncontent \nRacism, biased \nor misleading \ninfo\/ advice (e.g. \ndrugs) \nContact \n- child as \nparticipant \nTracking\/ \nharvesting \npersonal info \nBeing bullied, \nstalked or \nharassed \nMeeting \nstrangers, \nbeing \ngroomed \nSelf-harm, \nunwelcome \npersuasion \nConduct \n- child as \nactor \nGambling, \nhacking, \nillegal \ndownloads \nBullying or \nharassing \nanother \nCreating and \nuploading \nporn material \nProviding advice \ne.g. suicide\/ pro-\nanorexic chat \nSource: EU Kids Online (Hasebrink et al, 2008) \n \nThis usefully organizes the available research evidence on the incidence of risky \nexperiences (although it does not wholly satisfactorily distinguish risks from opportunities in \nthe sense that meeting new people, or exploring intimate experiences, may be perceived as \nopportunity by children but a risk by parents). Bearing in mind differences in the measures \nused, since different countries have conducted research in different ways, the EU Kids Online \nnetwork2 reviewed over 500 research projects conducted recently in 21 European countries, \ngenerating a broad picture of the experiences of online teenagers33 (having found little \nresearch on younger children) (Hasebrink, et al., 2008): .  \n \n \n\u2022 Giving out personal information: while not strictly speaking a risk, this is a likely \nprecondition for many of the risks shown in Table 1 and is reported by half of online \nteens (with national variations spanning 13% - 91% of teenagers); \n\u2022 Seeing pornography: around 4 in 10 across Europe (ranging from 25% - 80%, \ndoubtless depending on definitions); \n\u2022 Seeing violent or hateful content: around 1 in 3 (fairly consistent cross-nationally); \n\u2022 Being bullied\/harassed\/stalked: around 1 in 5 or 6 (higher in few countries); \n\u2022 Receiving unwanted sexual comments: around 1 in 10 teens in Germany, Ireland, \nPortugal; around 1 in 3 or 4 in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK; rising to 1 in 2 \nin Poland; \n\u2022 Meeting an online contact offline: around 9% (1 in 11) online teens in most \ncountries, rising to 1 in 5 in the Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden; \n \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nAfter the risks associated with personal disclosure, content-related risks appear the \nmost common \u2013 especially exposure to unwelcome or inappropriate sexual or aggressive \ncontent (though commercial and value-based content risks have been little researched). \nContact risks vary in incidence, with bullying fairly commonplace, sexual harassment less \ncommon and, potentially most risky but least common, meeting online contacts (\u2018strangers\u2019) \noffline.  \nUndoubtedly, there is scope to contest both the definition and measurement of online \nrisk; still, the emerging consensus is that the internet affords significant risk of harm to \nchildren and young people, with evidence that 15\u201320 per cent of online teens have felt \ndistress or discomfort or threatened on the internet. Similar findings to those found in Europe \nalso exist in the USA. A national survey of 10\u201317-yearolds in 2006 found one in three had \nbeen exposed to unwanted sexual content, onein three communicated online with people \nthey had not met offline, one in seven had received an unwanted sexual solicitation, and 9 \nper cent had been distressed by exposure to unwanted sexual material (Wolak, et al., 2006). \nNot all children encounter risk online to the same degree, and socio-demographic \nfactors make a difference. Both the UKCGO and SAFT surveys found that older teenagers \nwere more likely than younger ones to meet online friends offline, while boys and middle \nclass teenagers were more likely to disclose personal information online (Livingstone & \nHelsper, 2007; Staksrud, forthcoming-a; see also Mitchell et al 2007). Internet usage matters: \nthe UKCGO survey found that those who used the internet more (in time spent and range of \nuses), and those who were more technically skilled, experienced a greater range of online \nrisks (Livingstone & Helsper, 2009). The SAFT survey found that late starters (who began \nusing the internet after the age of twelve) or those with more limited experience online were \nmore at risk of harm from people they arranged offline meetings with (Staksrud, forthcoming-\na).  \nLeast researched is the possibility that psychological and family factors matter. \nChildren\u2019s social difficulties, psychological depression and\/or aggressive practices may \nincrease their chance of online risk (Ybarra, Mitchell, Finkelhor, & Wolak, 2007). Those \nmotivated to compensate for lack of social relations offline by forming new online \nrelationships are more likely to seek new contacts (Peter, Valkenburg, & Schouten, 2006). \nThose with lower selfesteem or life satisfaction, and possibly those with poorer relations with \ntheir parents, also encounter more online risks (Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). If the research \nagenda is to encompass questions of online risk management as well as risk prevention, the \nrisk factors and protective factors that shape children\u2019s lives require investigation.  \n \nFrom risk avoidance to risk management \nWhat happens after the pornographic, violent or gory content has been accessed? Or after a \nface-to-face meeting following an online encounter? Or after receiving a frightening or \nharassing message online? The EU Kids Online review found qualitative evidence that \nchildren are developing strategies to cope with online risks, gaining confidence in their use. \nBut, how these are applied and whether they are effective, remains unknown (Hasebrink, et \nal., 2008). The Eurobarometer survey conducted in 2005\/06 provides pan-European answers \nto two questions asked of parents\/carers whose child (0\u201317 years) uses the internet: has \ntheir child ever encountered harmful or illegal content on the internet; and do they think their \nchild knows what to do if a situation on the internet makes them feel uncomfortable? Treating \nthe latter as a rough indication of parents\u2019 judgment  regarding their child\u2019s ability to cope, we \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nnote that nearly one third say their child has encountered harmful content on the internet and \ntwo thirds say their child knows what to do in such situations (see Table 2).  \n \nTable 24: Parents\u2019 perceptions of their child\u2019s encounter with harmful\/illegal content and \ntheir ability to cope.

This suggests that where parents \njudge their child to encounter little risk, they need not worry about their coping; but where \nthey judge risk to be higher, they are concerned that their child may not cope. In two small, \nSouthern countries (Cyprus, Austria) the correlation is positive, suggesting that children who \nencounter more risk are judged to cope better than those who encounter less. It seems \nplausible that in the first set of countries, increasing internet use is seen, whether as a result \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nof personal experience or awareness-raising, to generate risks that children are unprepared \nfor. The finding for the second pair of countries may be regarded complacently, though \nequally it may indicate a low awareness of online risk in countries relatively new to the \ninternet. \n \nFigure 1: Parents\u2019 perceptions of their child\u2019s encounter with harmful\/illegal content and \ntheir ability to cope, by country.

Figure 1 shows that the \nhigher the percentage of parents in a country who claim their child has encountered harmful \ncontent, the lower the estimated ability of children in that country to cope with these \npotentially harmful encounters, and vice versa. Differences in the absolute level of risk \nperceived in each country suggest a different country grouping: possibly, in countries \nperceived by parents to pose lower risk (Belgium, Cyprus, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, \nUK6), children have indeed learned to cope. But it seems more likely that in lower risk \ncountries, parents are less aware of children\u2019s need to cope and so overestimate their \nresilience. Similarly in countries perceived to be at higher risk (Romania, Estonia and \nBulgaria, followed by Sweden, Slovenia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic), children may \nreally be less able to cope or, more likely, in higher risk countries, parents are more aware of \ntheir children\u2019s need to cope.  \nThe foregoing suggests that the incidence of risk and the ability to cope are culturally \nshaped. Intriguingly, while policy initiatives tend to be often directed at those relatively new to \nthe internet, different initiatives are clearly required once the population becomes more \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nexperienced online. In what follows, we examine children\u2019s responses to online risk in three \ncountries where the evidence of risky activities (as opposed to parental perceptions) \nsuggests risks are fairly high (Hasebrink, et al., 2008). The three countries were chosen for \npragmatic reasons: although there are many surveys regarding children\u2019s online risk \nexperiences, only in Ireland, Norway and the UK did we find surveys that followed up on \nquestions about perceived risk with questions posed to children about their responses, \ncoping or otherwise.5 Broadly comparable questions were asked in each country, enabling \nthe examination of both common and distinctive \npatterns of coping within and across countries in relation to two research \nquestions, which were operationalized as follows. \n \nRQ1: How do children feel about online risk (operationalized as seeing pornography or \nviolent or gruesome material online, being bullied or harassed online, or meeting \nsomeone in real life who they first met online).  \nRQ2: What do children do having encountered online risk (operationalized aswhat they \ndo after seeing pornography or violent or gruesome material online, after being bullied or \nharassed online, or having gone to an offline meeting with an online contact). \n \nData collection \nThe SAFT and UKCGO projects investigated children\u2019s use, activities and risks online. The \nSAFT project initially surveyed 9\u201316-year-olds in Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway and \nSweden in 2003 (Staksrud, 2008b). Its questionnaire informed the design of the UKCGO \nproject, which surveyed 1,511 9\u201319-year-olds in the UK in 2004 (Livingstone & Bober, 2004). \nThe SAFT survey was replicated in Ireland and Norway in 2006. For the present analysis, the \ndatasets from Ireland (2006)7, Norway (2006) and the UK (2004) were reanalysed for 9\u201316-\nyear-olds who used the internet once per week or more frequently (see Table 3).8  \n \n \nTable 3: Samples interviewed in each country, by age and gender  \n(Filter: uses the internet at least once per week) \n \n \n \nIreland Norway UK \nNumber of interviews 604 792 952 \n \n                    Sample ( %) by age \n9-12 years 45% 47% 47% \n \n13-16 years 54% 52% 53% \n \n Sample (%) by age and gender \nBoys 9-12 years 21% 24% 24% \nBoys 13-16 years 28% 26% 26% \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nGirls 9-12 years 24% 23% 22% \nGirls 13-16 years 26% 26% 27% \n \nMethods of data collection in the two projects differed: the SAFT project collected the \ndata by self-completion surveys in schools, supervised by a professional market research \ninterviewer and with no teacher or parent present; the UKCGO project collected the data via \nin-home computer-assisted interviews conducted by a professional market research \ninterviewer, but with self-completion portions of the survey for sensitive questions concerning \nonline risks. All data have been weighted in accordance with population estimates. The \nsurvey questionnaires can be found at www.eukidsonline.net.  \nResearching children and risk requires care in terms of research ethics, as the \nquestions concern activities and experiences that might be perceived as \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018illegal\u2019, \n\u2018embarrassing\u2019 or \u2018private\u2019. Both projects conducted considerable qualitative work and pilot \ntesting before framing the survey questions to check the appropriateness of question \nwording. The SAFT project obtained informed consent for the children to participate from \nboth school head teachers and parents. The UKCGO survey sought written consent from \nparents and children (for those under 18 years old). \nSince national surveys were conducted under somewhat different conditions, in \ndifferent languages and with different samples, no statistical comparisons are made, and we \ncomment only on sizeable percentage differences (5 per cent or more). Note also that since \nmultiple response options were permitted for many questions, we focus on relative values \n(e.g. responses of older vs. younger children) and absolute percentages should be \ninterpreted with caution, especially as our focus is on matters that are far from easy to \nexamine with a survey questionnaire. \n \nComparative analysis of risk findings \nHow much exposure to online risk do children in the three countries report? Figure 2 shows \nthat, consistent with the overall European findings, content risks are more common than \ncontact risks, with exposure to online pornography being more common than to violent or \ngruesome material. Seeing online pornography, whether intentionally or accidentally, is \nexperienced by a majority of teenagers \u2013 around two-thirds of those in Norway and the UK. \nContact risks are less common: a substantial minority have experienced online threats or \nbullying; only a small minority have been to an (offline) meeting with a contact that they first \nmet online, though this rises to one in five Norwegian teenagers.  \nEach risk is reported more by teenagers (13\u201316 years old) than younger children (9\u201312 \nyears old). Gender differences are also striking, with content risks higher for boys than girls, \nthough this is not the case for contact risks where gender differences appear small; contrary \nto publicity regarding the grooming of girls, it seems that older boys are more likely to meet \nonline contacts offline.  \n \n \n \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\n \nFigure 2: Overall risk exposure among child internet users in UK, Ireland, and Norway, by \ngender and age \nIn Norway and, especially, the UK, older girls seem more often bullied online. Ireland was \nlowest overall on exposure to pornography, although the younger Irish boys were most likely \n(44 per cent) and younger Irish girls were the least likely (12 per cent) to have seen \npornography online. Irish children seem more likely to have seen online violence, overall, with \nfew differences between Norway and the UK on content risks. However, meeting online \ncontacts offline is notably higher in Norway, especially among teenagers (at 21 per cent), \ncompared with Ireland (11 per cent of teenagers) and the UK (8 per cent of teenagers). While \ncross-national differences in incidence of risk clearly merit further investigation, our purpose \nhere is to examine children\u2019s responses to risk.  \nResponses to content risks \nHow do children feel about seeing pornography and violent or gruesome material online? \nAmong those who have seen online pornography, responses varied by country, age and \ngender, as shown in Figure 3. The response option, \u2018I didn\u2019t think too much about it\u2019, may \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nindicate low perceived risk: this is more common among older teenagers, especially boys, \nand among British children. The options, \u2018I thought it was funny\u2019 and \u2018I thought it was cool\u2019, \nsuggest a risk-taking attitude which may reflect either resilience or defiance: neither was as \ncommonly used, especially by younger children and girls, though Irish children, especially the \nyounger ones, seem particularly defiant (or \u2018naughty\u2019), with the younger girls thinking \npornography funny (possibly out of embarrassment) and the older teenage boys thinking it \ncool. The remaining two options, \u2018It upset me\u2019 and \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t seen it\u2019, suggest high \nperceived risk or even actual harm: though fairly uncommon, the second option was more \nendorsed by younger children and by girls. Further, \u2018It upset me\u2019 was more common in the \nUK, especially among girls, and \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t seen it\u2019 was more common in Norway, \nespecially among younger children. Some of the greatest variation, interestingly, is among \nthe younger girls: the Irish girls thought it funny (52 per cent), the British girls were upset (52 \nper cent) and the Norwegian girls wished they hadn\u2019t seen it (48 per cent): possibly these \nstrong reactions reflect equivalent repugnance framed differently according to culture.  \n \n \n \nFigure 3: Reported feelings about seeing pornography, in UK, Ireland and Norway, by age \nand gender (among internet users who have seen pornography online)1\n \n \nThe link between perceived risk and coping or risk management was not \ne interpreting the findings requires judgements \u2013 possibly straightforward, partly becaus\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1\u00a0Slightly\u00a0different\u00a0wordings\u00a0were\u00a0used\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0UK\u00a0questionnaire:\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cit\u00a0upset\u00a0me\u201d,\u00a0they\u00a0answered\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0\nthought\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0disgusting\u201d;\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0thought\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0cool\u201d,\u00a0they\u00a0answered\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0thought\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0\ninteresting\u201d;\u00a0and\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0thought\u00a0it\u00a0was\u00a0funny\u201d,\u00a0they\u00a0answered\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0enjoyed\u00a0it\u201d.\u00a0\nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\ncontentious \u2013 about the value of children\u2019s responses. Figure 4 suggests that a positive \ncoping response (\u2018I ignored it\u2019) was the most common (as with the above \u2018I didn\u2019t think too \nmuch about it\u2019), especially among British children. It was also more common among \nteenagers, which we interpret either in terms of a higher response rate on this question \namong teenagers (note that younger children did not select many of the options offered) or, \npossibly, among those children who saw it, it was interesting in some way (compared with \nthe teens for whom, as we saw above, might be less shocking).  \nWhat we might term \u2018negative\u2019 responses \u2013 those that extend rather than diminish the \nrisk, such as \u2018I bookmarked it\u2019 and \u2018I sent the URL to some of my friends\u2019 \u2013 were much less \ncommon overall, though a little higher among Irish children and Norwegian teenagers. The \nproportion of young Irish girls who bookmarked pornography follows from their apparent \namusement at seeing it (above), albeit in a way we find difficult to explain: possibly a Catholic \nculture creates a specific and taboo interest in such material that intrigues young girls. \nBookmarking and, especially, sending the address of porn sites to peers is, clearly, a \nteenage boys\u2019 practice, consistent with their finding such content \u2018cool\u2019 and revealing a youth \nsubculture that crosses national boundaries. \nThe pro-active coping response, at least for those concerned about encountering \npornography, is to tell someone: this is the response promoted by safety awareness \ninitiatives. Limited success is evident from the high likelihood of younger children telling a \nparent or teacher in each country (11 per cent in the UK, 13 per cent in Norway, 19 per cent \nin Ireland). Norwegian and, especially, Irish children are far more likely to tell a friend than \nBritish children, leaving the British overall the least likely to tell anyone, it seems. \n \n \n \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\n \nFigure 4: Reported actions after seeing pornography in UK, Ireland and Norway, by age \n(among internet users who have seen pornography online)2\n \nAlthough the overall incidence of seeing violence or gruesome content online is lower \nthan for pornography, children\u2019s responses follow a broadly similar pattern (see Figure \n5).When asked how they felt, \u2018I didn\u2019t think too much about it\u2019 is the most common response, \nwith fewer finding it funny, cool or upsetting. Again, British girls are more likely to find such \ncontent upsetting, Irish children to find it funny or cool, and Norwegian children to wish they \nhad never seen it, confirming the suggestion above that these represent culturally different \nframings to, possibly, a similar underlying reaction of negativity or embarrassment.  \n \n \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2\u00a0Slightly\u00a0different\u00a0wordings\u00a0were\u00a0used\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0UK\u00a0questionnaire:\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0ignored\u00a0it\u201d,\u00a0they\u00a0answered\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0\nleft\u00a0the\u00a0site\u00a0immediately\u00a0without\u00a0looking\u00a0at\u00a0it\u201d;\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0bookmarked\u00a0it\u201d,\u00a0they\u00a0answered\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0went\u00a0back\u00a0\nto\u00a0it\u00a0another\u00a0time\u201d;\u00a0instead\u00a0of\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0sent\u00a0the\u00a0URL\u00a0to\u00a0some\u00a0of\u00a0my\u00a0friends\u201d,\u00a0they\u00a0answered\u00a0\u201cI\u00a0sent\u00a0the\u00a0website\u00a0\naddress\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0friend\u201d\u00a0\nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\n \nFigure 5: Reported feelings about seeing violent or gruesome material online, in UK, Ireland \nand Norway, by age and gender (among internet users who have seen violent or gruesome \nmaterial online)3 \n \nFigure 6 shows what children do after seeing violent content online.

We note, further, that across all risk types, children are \nrelatively sanguine about the consequences \u2013 pornography and violent content is typically \nignored, bullying messages are deleted and face-to-face meetings with online contacts \nmostly result in \u2018a good time\u2019. This suggests that safety messages \u2013 both passive (ignore, \ndelete, etc.) and active (tell someone, take a friend to a meeting) are effectively reaching \nmany children.  \nHowever, the signs of distress are also spread across risk types \u2013 for example, a \nsizeable minority of British children exposed to pornography were upset, while Norwegian \nchildren wished they hadn\u2019t seen it; further, a small number of children had a bad experience \non meeting an online contact. There are promising indications, meriting further research, that \nemotional responses to online risk are translated into appropriate actions \u2013 for example, \nyounger girls were not only the most concerned about seeing online violence but they were \nalso the most likely to tell an adult (in Norway and Britain). On the other hand, children\u2019s \nevident reluctance to tell an adult rather than a friend, as well as the demographic and \nnational variation in responses, points to a range of factors that shape coping responses, \nsome of which may impede appropriate self-protective actions. \nFor the three countries analysed here, demographic differences are more striking than \ncross-national differences. Teenagers encounter more risks than younger children, boys \nencounter more content risks and, contrary to popular perception, go to more meetings, than \ngirls, while older girls may be more often bullied online. However, younger girls report \nstronger responses to online risk experiences, mainly negative (though the Irish responses \nare puzzling) and, therefore, they may respond constructively to safety messages targeted at \nthem. Teenagers, and boys, appear to pay less attention to online risk, suggesting they may \nbe harder to reach in terms of safety advice \u2013 an issue since they encounter more risk. \nTeenage boys are also most likely to perpetuate risk in, one may judge, an irresponsible \nmanner \u2013 they bookmark pornographic or violence links and send them on to friends, for \nexample.  \nIntriguingly, each country stands out for a different risk \u2013 Ireland is higher for violent \ncontent and lower for pornography, Norway is highest for meeting online contacts offline, the \nUK is highest, at least among teenage girls, for bullying. This pattern of findings is, perhaps \ncuriously, seemingly unrelated to media coverage: a content analysis of media coverage of \nchildren and online risks in twelve European countries finds the UK (and to a lesser extent \nIreland) to give more publicity to online sexual content than Norway, while Norway appears \nmore concerned about bullying (Haddon & Stald, in prep). Another possibility is that online \nmultiplayer games are particularly well established among Norwegian boys (Kaare, 2005) \nand that their high rate of face-to-face meetings is because they are meeting up with their \n\u2018clan\u2019 or group or going to \u2018the Gathering\u2019, an annual event with thousands of participants.  \nThese three countries differ in other ways too. Based on a combination of \nEurobarometer and SAFT findings, Hasebrink et al. (2008) classified Norway as a high child \nuse\/high parent use country, the UK as high child use\/medium  parent use, and Ireland as \nmedium child use\/medium parent use.9 This suggests that the gap between children\u2019s online \nexperiences and parental awareness or readiness to mediate may be greatest in the UK, \nwhile in Ireland, both parents and children may be less experienced or skilled online, \ncompared with  Norway. Yet British children seem no less likely to tell an adult of a risky \nexperience, albeit that this is a minority response among children generally (though British \nchildren are less likely to tell a friend, interestingly). Possibly the lesser experience of the \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\ninternet in Ireland may account for some of the odd responses from Irish children \u2013 \nbookmarking risky content, finding it cool or funny. \nOther cross-national differences may be more intangible, raising issues yet to be \nexplored empirically. For example, a comparison of tragic events in Norway and the UK \nreveals subtle cultural constructions of risk and responsibility. The murder of two-year-old \nJames Bulger in the UK in 1993 became \u2018a watershed in the history of youth justice and in \nour attitudes towards children\u2019 (Jewkes, 2004, p. 91). One year later, a five-year-old \nNorwegian girl, Silje Marie Redergard, was killed by four other children while playing. \nHowever, in the UK, the two child perpetrators were publicly labelled as evil monsters and \ntheir parents too were blamed (Barker & Petley, 2001), but the Norwegian children were  \ninstead treated as themselves victims (Freeman, 1997). The implications of these and similar \ncultural factors are little understood, and probably would Benefit from qualitative rather than \nsurvey research.  \nThis article has shown that children\u2019s ability to cope with online risk varies across types \nof risks, cultures, gender and age. It seems plausible that their coping strategies depend on \nhow they themselves regard the risk. While parents might see children\u2019s exposure to \npornography online as problematic, many children will perceive it as \u2018cool\u2019, \u2018fun\u2019 or not think \ntoo much about it. likewise, while face-to-face meetings with online contacts often is labelled \nas \u2018dangerous\u2019 and linked to paedophile activities, for most children such meetings result in a \npositive experience with other peers. It will therefore surely be ineffective to advise children to \navoid such meetings altogether: they will hear from peers that there are no problems, and so \ndiscredit safety advice. That children are far more likely to turn to friends than parents or \nteachers, that some children compound rather than avoid online risk, and that \ndemographically and culturally  different groups appear to respond in different ways, are all \nfactors that make the effort to develop children\u2019s resilience a difficult, albeit also an important, \ntask.  \nThe present analysis has, we hope, made the best use of survey findings which, \nnonetheless, were not strictly designed for cross-national comparison and which both \nstruggled to ask reliable questions of children regarding emotional responses and coping \nactions. The methodological requirements for future research in this field pose challenges \nregarding research ethics, design and measurement which, though difficult, should now be \nattempted (Lobe, et al., 2007). Further cross-national research is also required that broadens \nthe range of online risks investigated, some of which may concern \u2018approved\u2019 content (e.g. \nthe news), about other values (e.g. racist or pro-anorexia content) and, occasioning \nincreasing concern, commercial content (from covert advertising to gambling sites).  \nWe conclude, in concurrence with the conclusions of the public consultation held by the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s Safer Internet plus programme (2007, p. 3) that risk and safety \nshould be addressed in the context of the \u2018overwhelmingly positive potential of the internet\u2019 \nand that since \u2018a risk free internet for children and young people is an illusion\u2019, more attention \nshould be paid to children\u2019s risk avoidance and their strategies for coping with risk and, \nindeed, harm. To put it another way, if no risk to children is considered acceptable, risk \nmanagement is reduced to preventing them from enjoying precisely the freedom of online \nexploration that, in other spheres \u2013 notably, education, self-expression and civic participation \n\u2013 society seeks to encourage. But if instead we recognize that risky encounters are \nnecessary to the development of resilience, the challenge shifts from that of risk prevention to \nthat of balancing tolerable levels of risk against desirable freedoms of opportunity. In support \nof this growing resilience, parents may need a closer understanding of their child\u2019s perception \nof online risks and appropriate coping strategies (Livingstone & Bober, 2006; Nikken & \nStaksrud\u00a0and\u00a0Livingstone\u00a02009\u00a0\nJansz, 2006; Staksrud, 2008a; Wilson, Peebles, Hardy, & Litt, 2006). Thus we invite further \nresearch on the consequences of risk, as understood and negotiated between parents and \nchildren. \n \nAcknowledgements \nAcknowledgements are due as follows.
