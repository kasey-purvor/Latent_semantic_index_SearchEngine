H. MATES\nUniversity of Durham\nIntroduction\nFRENCH COMMUNISTS AND SOCIALISTS pioneered the Popular Front, a strategy devel-\noped to combat the rise of fascism in the early 1930s. Demonstrations and a general\nstrike called jointly by both French left parties in February 1934 defeated a threatened\nfascist coup. Formal agreement between the Communists and Socialists came in July\n1934. Three months later French Communists went further, calling for an alliance of\nall progressive and democratic anti-fascist forces under the banner of a \u2018People\u2019s\nFront\u2019 (i.e. Popular Front).1 The \u2018Dimitrov resolution\u2019, passed at the Seventh World\nCommunist Congress in July\u2013August 1935, brought the international Communist\nmovement into line with these developments. Popular Front governments were elected\nin Spain in February 1936 and in France three months later.2 The Popular Front\nstrategy replaced the ultra-sectarian \u2018Class Against Class\u2019 policy of the \u2018Third Period\u2019.\nThen Communist parties directed much of their invective at the leaders of Labour and\nSocial Democratic parties, who they deemed \u2018social fascists\u2019. The policy\u2019s effects were\nwidely regarded as disastrous: it divided the German left so completely that Hitler\ncould not but take decisive advantage.\nIn Britain, the urgent need was to defeat the National Government, which many on\nthe left regarded as pro-fascist. The British engineered policy of non-intervention in\nSpain aided the fascist-backed rebels as it denied the democratically constituted\n* I would like to thank Peter Mates, Professor Martin Pugh and the staff of the libraries and archives mentioned.\n1 Some historians, such as Jim Fyrth, preferred the term \u2018People\u2019s Front\u2019, but it is synonymous with Popular\nFront. Orwell wrote that Communists liked \u2018People\u2019s Front\u2019 as the title lent the strategy a \u2018spuriously democratic\nappeal\u2019. Britain, Fascism and the Popular Front, ed.

The term \u2018Popular Front\u2019 was also unfortunate as it allowed critics such as\nJ. Henderson to deem it an \u2018un-Popular Front\u2019 (with, as will be seen, justification in the North-East). Blaydon\nCourier, 13 May 1938.\n2 M.

Some on the left thought that this could occur through a reinvigorated League\nof Nations. There was, after all, wide support for the principles of the League of\nNations in the Labour and Liberal parties. Popular Fronters believed that an alliance\nwith France, Russia, America and other democracies could halt fascist expansionism.\nHowever, most left-wing Labour Popular Fronters also argued against supporting the\nNational Government\u2019s moves to rearm. These arms, they claimed, were more likely\nto be used to support fascism than to combat it.\nPopular Front agitation did not take the form of a nation-wide, cross-party\ngrassroots campaign explicitly devoted to advancing the strategy until 1938.5 Before\nthen, the left largely concentrated on promoting co-operation within its own ranks,\nwhich many regarded as an important first step to forging an alliance with Liberals\nand other \u2018non-working-class\u2019 organizations.6 This was the object of the 1937 \u2018Unity\n3 The appeasement policy has been the source of considerable historical debate.

Eric Hobsbawm thus described the Popular Front as \u2018a set of concentric circles of unity: at its centre\nthe united front of the working-class movement, which in turn formed the basis of an even broader anti\u2013fascist\npeople\u2019s front, which in turn provided in the relevant countries the base for a national front of all those determined\nto resist fascism [. . .], and finally \u2014 even more loosely \u2014 an international front of governments and peoples \u2014\nincluding the USSR \u2014 against fascism and war. Each of these circles had, as it were, a different degree of unity\u2019.\nHowever, the ILP did not agree, and it would not contemplate association with capitalist parties. George Orwell,\nbriefly an ILP member in 1938, wrote: \u2018The People\u2019s Front is only an idea, but it has already produced the nauseous\nspectacle of bishops, Communists, cocoa magnates, publishers, duchesses, and Labour MPs marching arm in arm\nto the tune of \u201cRule Britannia\u201d.\u2019 Underlying the ILP attitude was the belief that fascism was the product of capital-\nist crisis and that any capitalist society was susceptible to it. Fascism was a desperate attempt by the ruling class to\nretain its power in societies that appeared to be disintegrating under severe economic depression. To eliminate\nfascism, socialism had to replace capitalism. For this reason only socialist parties should co\u2013operate. The Popular\nFront strategy was based on the idea that fascism was a threat to democracy and that all democratic forces needed\nto combine in order to defeat it. Crucially, the idea that fascism was inherent to capitalism and could not be defeated\nwithout overthrowing it was jettisoned. The Communist Party\u2019s support for the Popular Front, which necessitated\nclass collaboration, allowed the ILP to criticize it from a left wing position.

MATES\nCampaign\u2019, undertaken by the Communist Party and the Independent Labour Party.\nThe third component of the \u2018Unity Campaign\u2019 was the Socialist League, a left-wing\nginger group within the Labour Party. Its leader was Sir Stafford Cripps, a relatively\nrecent recruit to the Labour Party who had been radicalized by the experience of\neconomic slump in the early 1930s.\nOn 20 March 1938 Sydney Elliott, editor of the national Co-operative newspaper\nReynold\u2019s News, launched the campaign for a \u2018United Peace Alliance\u2019 (yet another\nname for a Popular Front). It was a direct response to the German incorporation of\nAustria into the Reich. The Liberal News Chronicle stated its approval and the Co-\noperative Party conference passed a resolution supporting the proposal in April 1938.\nThe Liberal leader, Sir Archibald Sinclair, and three Liberal MPs had been favourable\nto the idea since 1936 and in May 1938 the Liberal Party backed the Popular Front.\nHowever, most of the Labour Party leadership opposed the Popular Front through-\nout the period and the campaign fizzled out by mid-1938. The campaign to promote\nthe Popular Front policy inside the Labour Party came to a climax in early 1939,\nwhen Sir Stafford Cripps launched his \u2018Petition campaign.\u2019 This was crucial as Popu-\nlar Fronters agreed that the Labour Party would have to lead any successful Popular\nFront government. Cripps\u2019s move came three months after the Munich agreement,\nwhich had induced a feeling of powerlessness in Labour Party ranks and prompted\nincreasing calls for a Popular Front to combat the government more effectively.7\nSoon after Munich \u2018Popular Front\u2019 candidates did well at the Oxford and Bridgwater\nby-elections, which seemed to give the project new impetus.8 Cripps\u2019s memorandum in\nJanuary 1939 to the Labour Party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) argued\nthat the party would not be able to defeat the National Government at the next\nelection unless it placed itself at the head of an electoral alliance of \u2018all opposition\nparties\u2019.9 The NEC rejected the idea. Undeterred, Cripps embarked on a national\ncampaign in order to rally support and convince the NEC to change its mind. The\nparty expelled him for this action.\nAttitudes within the north-east labour movement were particularly important as\nCripps launched his campaign to collect the signatures of Popular Front supporters at\na public meeting in Newcastle on Sunday, 5 February 1939. Fortune played its part in\nthis decision as Cripps requisitioned a pre-arranged Tribune (a Cripps-controlled peri-\nodical) rally in the town. However, Newcastle was in many regards an appropriate\nplace to launch such a campaign.10 It was the main city of a region characterized by a\ntraditionally moderate and loyal labour movement that dominated in many localities.\nThis was especially true of the coal producing areas of County Durham. There,\nLabour enjoyed hegemonic support amongst the working class.

This article\nwill examine in detail Cripps\u2019s Petition campaign in the North-East; the attitudes and\nactions of its supporters and opponents, its effects, successes and failures and their\ncauses and consequences, comparing these with the less well documented 1938 United\nPeace Alliance campaign.13 Consideration of these two Popular Front campaigns at\ngrassroots level is itself of utility.14 However, more importantly, the failure of the\nPopular Front campaigns in the North-East throws light on the political culture\nof the region; on the attitudes within parties and relations between political party\nactivists at grassroots level during a tumultuous moment in twentieth-century British\nhistory.\nCripps\u2019s friends and enemies in the North\nTribune deemed the inaugural \u2018Petition Campaign\u2019 meeting in Newcastle an \u2018amazing\nexperience\u2019 that had seen \u2018as good a launching as ever had any ship\u2019.15 Even the\n11 J.

Robert Moore claimed Methodism and nonconformism were largely responsible for the character\nof the DMA\u2019s trade unionism. Methodism emphasized thrift and accepted ownership of private property. Noncon-\nformist beliefs were based on an acceptance of the market system: they encouraged deference to coal owners and\nplaced faith in arbitration and conciliation rather than confrontation.

Trevelyan and Blenkinsop had supported the Popular Front\n\u2018United Peace Alliance\u2019 campaign in 1938.19 Though there is no evidence of Lawther\nor Watson supporting the United Peace Alliance they were both on the Labour left\nand had actively supported the united front.20 Oxford-educated Wilkes had only\nbeen Labour parliamentary candidate for Newcastle Central since January 1938 and\nwas, at twenty-two, possibly the youngest prospective parliamentary candidate in\nEngland.21 It is likely that Wilkes did not openly support the United Peace Alliance\nbecause he did not wish to jeopardize his standing within the Labour Party at such an\nearly stage in his career.22 These observations largely applied to other high-profile\npetition campaign supporters. County Councillor John Bell, who agitated for Cripps\nwithin Bishop Auckland constituency Labour Party, was a long-standing friend of\nTrevelyan who shared his views on the deteriorating international scene.23 Blaydon\nleft-wingers Henry Bolton, Steve Lawther and wife Emmie all acted in various ways\nto marshal support for Cripps.24\n16 Newcastle Journal, 6 Feb. 1939. Though not supporting the campaign from a left wing perspective, perhaps the\nNewcastle Journal had as much reason as Tribune to exaggerate the success of the meeting as this would suggest that\nthe splits within the labour movement over the Popular Front were considerable.\n17 A. J. A. Morriss, C. P. Trevelyan: Portrait of a Radical (Belfast, 1977).\n18 The first seven names on Cripps\u2019s petition were published in Tribune. The sixth and seventh names were those of\nHyman Lee and Harry Brook. Lee was an important figure in the north\u2013east Communist Party so his name was not\nsurprising. Brook was a member of Newcastle East constituency Labour Party (Blenkinsop\u2019s party) and the Shop\nAssistants\u2019 Union. Tribune, 10 Feb. 1939.\n19 Blenkinsop and Wilkes were the only two north-east parliamentary candidates of a total of sixty\u2013four men-\ntioned in a presumed list of Cripps Labour parliamentary candidate supporters. A letter in April from Labour\nparliamentary candidates to the NEC pledging support for Cripps was signed by Wilkes and thirteen others, but not\nBlenkinsop.

Watson was a member of\nDurham Left Book Club circle. Durham Chronicle, 11 Jun., 30 Jul. 1937; J. Lewis, The Left Book Club.

In Sept. 1938, Wilkes was apparently prevented from chairing a Left Book Club rally in\nNewcastle with Gollancz and Communist leader Pollitt as speakers by an intervention from Transport House.\nPost\u2013war, Wilkes was involved in \u2018Keep Left\u2019 (the Bevanite left wing group).

Will Lawther\u2019s attitude, for example, was distinctly\nlukewarm. He agreed to stop supporting Cripps when the NEC threatened him with\nexpulsion from the Labour Party.25 Support from Blenkinsop and Wilkes was impor-\ntant, but both of these were young men. The young are expected to be rebellious and\ncan be afforded indulgences. The NEC did expel the veteran aristocrat Trevelyan for\nhis actions. Though clearly dedicated, Trevelyan\u2019s flaw was ignorance of his own\nconstituency Labour Party\u2019s attitude to the issue. He admitted having \u2018no conception\nwhat they are thinking in the rank-and-file\u2019 immediately before attending the\nWansbeck constituency party meeting on the controversy.26 This became evident\nwhen his pro-Cripps resolution was easily defeated at the constituency party\u2019s annual\nmeeting, despite Trevelyan\u2019s own high standing in the party.27\nOthers, though pro-Popular Front, did not support Cripps\u2019s campaign at all.\nWillard Sexton (Hexham Labour parliamentary candidate) refused to sign a letter\nprotesting at NEC threats to Popular Front supporters within the party. Sexton was\n\u2018still in favour of a Popular Front, but in my view it has been apparent for some time\nthat there was not the slightest chance of carrying it at the Labour Party conference\u2019.28\nEllen Wilkinson, MP for Jarrow, argued for Cripps\u2019s plan on the Labour NEC, but\nshe did not sign the petition and was not prepared to risk expulsion.29 Wilkinson\nregretted the NEC decision to expel Cripps: \u2018I voted against it, but of course I remain\nloyal to the Socialist Party [sic.].\u201930 Wilkinson could not \u2018possibly\u2019 act as a sponsor for\nCripps\u2019s campaign as this would threaten the unity of the Labour Party.31 This stance\nwas consistent with her earlier loyalty to Labour and the NEC. Cripps also failed to\nconvince some important left-wingers. For example, Jim Stephenson was absent from\nBlaydon Labour Party\u2019s activities on the issue in 1939. Stephenson had not supported\nthe Popular Front in 1938 and Cripps\u2019s arguments had not changed his mind.32\nThe third major problem for Cripps was that most of the individuals who provided\nunstinting support represented no one other than themselves. Trevelyan got his local\n25 Lawther, along with C. L. Poole MP, provided a satisfactory reply to a letter from the NEC regarding support\nfor Cripps\u2019s campaign that had been sent to seven important Labour Party members (also including Bevan and\nTrevelyan). Cooke claimed that of those who withdrew their support from Cripps in February Lawther was \u2018the\nmost significant\u2019. (Watson seems not to have been named in the letter), but he also pointed out that the vote to\nsuspend standing orders and allow Cripps to speak at the 1939 Labour conference was \u2018due principally\u2019 to Lawther\nand the miners.

Despite not appear-\ning on Cripps\u2019s platform, Wilkinson still spoke at a large Popular Front demonstration in London at the end of Feb.\nprotesting against the recognition of Franco. Wilfred Roberts (Liberal MP, Cumberland North) was present in an\nunofficial capacity collecting signatures for Cripps\u2019s Petition. At the Newcastle Petition campaign meeting, Cripps\npaid tribute to Wilkinson\u2019s \u2018sincerity\u2019 and said that, in staying away, \u2018she had acted in the way she considered best in\nthe interests of the working\u2013classes\u2019.

However, the constituency party itself rejected the resolution by 111 against\nto only thirty-seven for.33 It continued to oppose the Popular Front even after\nTrevelyan\u2019s expulsion from the Labour Party over the issue.34 Likewise, Lawther and\nWatson received no official DMA support. The other DMA officials either remained\nsilent on the issue or supported the NEC, and there was no lodge vote on either\nCripps or the Popular Front.35 A large majority of Newcastle City Labour Party\nendorsed Cripps\u2019s expulsion and Blenkinsop\u2019s constituency Labour Party, Newcastle\nEast, followed suit at its annual meeting, with only four delegates defiant.36 Indeed,\nBishop Auckland constituency Labour Party was so hostile to Cripps supporters in its\nranks that it expelled Bell and M. Walton, a second Cripps supporter.37 Of the first\npetition signatories, only Wilkes received backing from his constituency Labour\nParty, Newcastle Central, which also sent two messages of support for Cripps in\nFebruary.38 This was particularly significant as Newcastle Central was the only\nconstituency Labour Party in the North-East to support Cripps unequivocally.\n33 Each parliamentary constituency had a Constituency Labour Party with a membership that could be active in\nall or some of three distinct levels of organization within the constituency: in ward Labour Parties (the lowest level),\nin local or town Labour Party branches (an intermediary level; \u2018town\u2019 here is used to distinguish between constitu-\nency and local Labour parties that have the same name, e.g. Jarrow, Gateshead, or South Shields) or at constituency\nlevel itself. Constituency Labour Parties were in turn organized into regional federations. There were two of these in\nthe North-East, Northumberland and Tyneside Federation of Labour Parties and Durham County Federation of\nLabour Parties. Each trade union had branches and a central organization for the north\u2013east region, normally\nbased in Newcastle. Trades councils organized branches of all trade unions in several larger localities and acted as\nlocal Trade Union Congresses. In some of the larger towns they acted as combined organizations with the local\nLabour Party (for examples, Jarrow, South Shields and Gateshead, but not in Newcastle or Blaydon). Trades coun-\ncils organized regionally by affiliating to the North\u2013East Federation of Trades Councils. There was also a national\norganization of trades councils that held annual conferences.\n34 N(orthumberland) R(ecord) O(ffice), 527\/A\/3, Wansbeck constituency Labour Party Minutes, 6 May, 8 Jul.\n1939; North Mail, 1 Apr. 1939; 6 May 1939; Sunday Sun, 19 Mar. 1939.\n35 The DMA Monthly Journal reproduced the cases for the NEC and Cripps in February and March 1939.\nGateshead Public Library, L622.33, DMA Monthly Journal, no.12, Mar. 1939; North Mail, 9 Feb. 1939. Eatwell was\nthus mistaken in interpreting the miners\u2019 choice of both Cripps and Bevan as guest speakers at the DMA gala in July\n1939 (receiving the largest and second largest number of votes from the lodges, respectively), as indicating official\nDMA support for the Popular Front. It could, of course, indicate rank-and-file support, but the small number of\nDMA lodges that openly advocated Cripps\u2019s plan suggests otherwise. As with Cripps\u2019s election as DMA gala\nspeaker in 1937, this did not necessarily indicate support for his political stance. Eatwell, thesis, p. 326; Mates,\nthesis, pp. 150\u201351.\n36 North Mail, 15, 17 Feb. 1939.\n37 This was despite the fact that the local Labour Party had, in mid-April, decided that all constituency Labour\nParty delegates should vote to take no action on Cripps or the Popular Front until Labour conference. Walton was\n\u2018heartily\u2019 thanked by the meeting for his \u2018splendid work\u2019 for the party.

Later that month, Wilkes put his name to another letter, signed by seventeen parliamentary\ncandidates, protesting at Labour\u2019s attitude to Cripps and reaffirming their intention to keep supporting the Popular\nFront.

The first level is of\nparties and union organizations (normally branches) that were left-wing dominated\nand therefore predictable Popular Front supporters. Their support thus represented\nthe least significant successes. Stanley local party, in which Bart Kelly, a United Peace\nAlliance supporter, played a leading role, can be ranked at this level. Other parties at\nthis level were Blaydon (Steve Lawther and Henry Bolton\u2019s party), Jarrow and South\nShields (all town rather than constituency Labour Parties). They all supported the\nUnited Peace Alliance in 1938, in areas where Labour was strong. In Newcastle\nCentral constituency Labour was weaker, but in the thrall of young left-winger\nWilkes. On the industrial side, the five DMA lodges openly supporting Cripps had all\nbeen involved in left-wing causes such as the Hunger March, supporting Communist\naffiliation to Labour or the united front \u2018Unity Campaign\u2019. Newcastle trades council\nwas also involved in all left-wing activity in this period.40\nThe second level comprises organizations that were not notably left-wing from\nareas where Labour was weak, such as in parts of Northumberland. Tynemouth\nLabour Party\u2019s support for Cripps was important as relations with the local Commu-\nnist Party had been poor and the party had not previously supported the Popular\n39 North\u2013East Labour movement organizations that either left evidence of their endorsement of the Cripps\nPetition Campaign or expressed disquiet at Cripps\u2019s treatment by the NEC were: Blaydon and Winlaton (including\nwomen\u2019s section), Birtley, Blyth, Cambo, Cleadon, Dunston, Ellington, Hebburn, Jarrow, Morpeth, Newburn,\nPrimrose and Monkton including women\u2019s section, Shiney Row, Shotton, South Hylton, South Shields, Stanley,\nTynemouth and Willington Quay local, ward and town Labour Parties and Newcastle Central constituency Labour\nParty. On the industrial side, support came from Blyth and Newcastle trades councils, Newcastle No.13 Amalgam-\nated Engineering Union branch (with a 500 membership), Heaton and Newcastle Locomotive Engineers and Fire-\nmen branches (Newcastle branch had defended Cripps from the NEC in 1936), Gateshead No. 1 Railwaymen\nbranch, Woodhorn branch of the Northumberland Colliery Mechanics Association (NCMA), Stanley (with a\nmembership of 180) and Shotton branches Municipal Workers (NUGMW) and five DMA lodges (of these,\nRandolph, Spen and Chopwell lodges clearly supported Cripps whilst Ravensworth and Hetton\u2019s stances merely\nimplied support). Hexham constituency Labour Party has not been included in this list as it is clear that it was anti\u2013\nPopular Front. Its 1939 annual meeting voted against a resolution supporting the Popular Front policy, though the\nsame meeting then passed a resolution calling on the NEC to reinstate Cripps.

South\nShields town Labour Party received a copy of a letter from their MP, Chuter Ede, to the national Labour Party\nsecretary, Middleton, expressing his amazement at the expulsion. The party then overwhelmingly passed (by\ntwenty-seven votes to two) a resolution protesting at the \u2018hasty\u2019 expulsion, condemning the \u2018attempt to stifle discus-\nsion within the party\u2019 and demanding a hearing for Cripps at conference. It also sent a message of support to\nTribune. In April 1939 it passed a resolution \u2018inviting\u2019 the NEC to bring all the prominent expelled Cripps support-\ners back into the party. Almost as soon as the controversy had broken, the secretary of West ward of Jarrow town\nLabour Party sent his \u2018best wishes\u2019 to Cripps. A Jarrow town Labour Party special meeting called to consider\nCripps\u2019s expulsion passed a resolution urging his re\u2013admission (sixty\u2013three votes to four in favour). Regardless of\ntheir MP Ellen Wilkinson\u2019s attitude, Jarrow town Labour Party (and its ward party in Primrose and Monkton\nward) sent messages of support for Cripps to Tribune throughout February.

H. MATES\nFront.41 The same went for Morpeth Labour Party\u2019s support for the petition\ncampaign. In 1936, Morpeth constituency Labour Party voted against supporting\nCommunist Party affiliation to Labour (albeit narrowly).42 Both Morpeth and\nTynemouth parties operated in strongly Conservative areas, so they potentially stood\nto gain directly from a progressive alliance. However, their support for the Popular\nFront was less predictable than that of the left-dominated parties discussed above and\ntherefore more of a success when it came.43\nA third group of parties that neither of the previous two conditions applied to\nrepresented the most significant gains for Cripps. The main example of this group was\nBlyth Labour Party, where Labour was dominant in local politics and not notably\nleft-wing. Indeed, relations between the Communist Party and the Labour Party in\nBlyth were strained well before 1939, with open clashes between members of the two\nparties over the 1936 Hunger March and the day-to-day unemployed campaigns.44\nA second example came in a section of Wansbeck constituency Labour Party. In\nFebruary 1937 a meeting of Newburn local Labour Party narrowly defeated a resolu-\ntion critical of the NEC\u2019s attack on the Socialist League, a left-wing ginger group, and\nagainst \u2018heresy hunting\u2019 within the party.45 In 1939 Newburn local Labour Party\nsupported Cripps. However, as these are the only two examples that can be cited with\ncertainty, this is a reflection of the lack of success Cripps\u2019s campaign achieved in the\nregion. Overall, Cripps secured support from most of the regional left-wing plus a\nhandful of other parties. It was nowhere near the level of support required even to\nchallenge the power of the union block votes at Labour\u2019s party conference.\nAn important qualification here is that it is not always clear from the evidence that\nthese organizations actually supported the Popular Front. A message of support\nfor Cripps or condemnation of the NEC did not necessarily indicate agreement\nwith Cripps\u2019s memorandum. For example, South Shields Labour MP Chuter Ede\u2019s\nsupport for Cripps extended only as far as defending him from his treatment by the\nNEC, rather than actually endorsing his proposals. There is no evidence that Ede had\nchanged his mind on the Popular Front since negative comments he made on\nan Ellen Wilkinson Popular Front memorandum in late 1938.46 More constituency\nLabour Parties expressed their opposition to the NEC\u2019s treatment of Cripps than sup-\nport for his plans. With many of the north-east organizations discussed above, it is\nimpossible to determine whether they supported Cripps\u2019s case for a Popular Front or\nwere merely supporting his right to argue his case against an anti-democratic and\n41 That Tynemouth trades council did not support Cripps was perhaps due to the chairholder, Ovington\u2019s, oppo-\nsition to Communism.

North Mail, 1 Apr. 1939; Mates, thesis, p. 24.\n43 Particularly so in Morpeth, where, according to Communist William Allan, Labour organizer Mr. N.

Given the relative tolerance of the north-east labour movement, it is\nvery likely that many organizations mentioned above fell into this latter category.\nMoreover, set against these successes were the organizations that would have been\nexpected to support Cripps, but which did not. Whilst important individuals in\nBlaydon Labour Party supported Cripps\u2019s campaign, it is unlikely Blaydon constitu-\nency Labour Party as a whole did, which was significant as it had supported the\nUnited Peace Alliance in 1938.47 South Shields constituency Labour Party also did not\nsupport Cripps and neither did Jarrow constituency Labour Party, despite significant\nsections of both parties backing him.48 The campaign\u2019s most important failures were\nNewcastle North and Newcastle East constituency Labour Parties. Both had sup-\nported the United Peace Alliance in 1938, but in 1939 they openly opposed Cripps.\nGateshead town Labour Party, which had supported the united front Unity\nCampaign in 1937, but not the Popular Front in 1938, was very quiet on the issue.\nContrary to Ferguson\u2019s claim, it was not clearly \u2018in favour of the idea of a Popular\nFront\u2019.49\nAnother damaging measure of the non-support for Cripps is evident in those who\nwere billed to speak at the \u2018Tribune Rally\u2019 in Newcastle on 5 February, but who then\npulled out when Cripps changed the meeting\u2019s remit. The main example was Ellen\nWilkinson, but other billed speakers who withdrew included David Adams (Labour\nMP for Consett), Jack Bowman (an Engineering Union regional official), William\nMaclean (Wansbeck Labour Party parliamentary candidate) and R. E. Butchart (of\nthe Shop Assistants\u2019 Union).50 Before the meeting, Tribune boasted that \u2018Practically\nthe whole of the local labour movement will thus be represented at this great meet-\ning\u2019.51 In the event, much of the local labour movement was, in fact, not represented.\nSupport from David Adams would have been a notable coup, had it been forthcom-\ning. The only Catholic Labour MP in the region, Adams nevertheless openly sup-\nported the Spanish Republican cause.52 Yet he and these other key individuals had\nshown their opposition to the Popular Front by pulling out of the pre-planned\nTribune meeting.\nStill, the 5 February launch meeting attracted an impressive audience of 3500 with\n1000 turned away.53 Flushed with success, Trevelyan claimed that the meeting had\n47 There is no evidence of the attitude of the Labour MP for the constituency, William Whitely.

Ferguson argued that Gateshead constituency\nLabour Party\u2019s choice of Konni Zilliacus as its parliamentary candidate proved that the party was pro\u2013Popular\nFront.

Fancy \u00a391 being subscribed in 15 minutes for the fund for running it!\u201954\nTrevelyan was exaggerating: the first Unity Campaign meeting in Newcastle only two\nyears earlier had mobilized 5000 people and raised only \u00a38 less.55 Furthermore, the\nUnity Campaign initiated in the region by this earlier equally substantial meeting\nhad no palpable positive effects. Eatwell was thus rightly critical of Cripps\u2019s over-\nestimation of the political impact of mass meetings.56 Moreover, as the meeting had\nbeen planned before the Cripps controversy had erupted, it is likely that, like the\nspeakers who were originally billed but did not speak, many in the audience did not\nsupport the Popular Front.\nSimilar observations regarding the size of public meetings not necessarily equating\nto support are also applicable to a Cripps meeting at Bishop Auckland in late March\n1939. With an attendance of 600, it was the largest meeting the town had seen for\nyears. Yet, just over a sixth (110) signed the petition, which was, curiously, even fewer\nthan the 115 who had volunteered to help collect signatures.57 Cripps meetings at\nNorth Shields (with an audience of 350) and West Stanley (600) were also impressive\nin terms of size. Yet a public meeting featuring a politician as well-known as Cripps\nwas always likely to attract large audiences in places that were normally overlooked\nby national political figures, out of curiosity if nothing else.58\nThe poor response to a conference organized to marshal regional support for the\nPetition campaign in Gateshead in mid-March 1939 was symbolic of its failure. There\nwere only 160 people representing fifty political parties, trade union branches, miners\u2019\nlodges and co-operative bodies present at the conference. This was less than 4 per cent\nof the 1400 organizations that had been invited.59 The support of around fifty \u2018pro-\ngressive organizations\u2019 in the whole of the North-East was hardly a ringing endorse-\nment for the Popular Front in 1939. In fact, this Petition conference was around half\nthe size of a United Peace Alliance conference held in the region ten months earlier\nand even this could not be regarded as well supported.60\n54 NRL, CPTEX133, C.P.

In fact, the way in which a large amount of the\nmoney was raised suggests that Cripps benefited from a handful of relatively wealthy benefactors rather than from\nthe pennies of working-class supporters. Trevelyan was the first to donate, and placed \u00a310 on the chairman\u2019s table.\nMembers of the audience in the front rows and those on the platform then threw several \u00a35 notes onto the table and\nan \u2018avalanche of half crowns\u2019 followed. In fact, more than two-thirds of the total donated (\u00a364 9s. 6d. of the \u00a391)\nwas raised in this way before the collecting tin was passed around the audience. Trevelyan\u2019s single donation\namounted to more than the difference in money raised between this and the Unity Campaign meetings; even then\nthe total collected was not massive. The north-east International Brigade memorial meeting, which occurred two\nweeks before, raised \u00a3142 13s. 6d. Trevelyan was not noted as having attended the first Unity Campaign demonstra-\ntion, so he may have been ignorant of the turnout and the amount raised. He was, however, at the International\nBrigade meeting and must have known that it raised over \u00a350 more.

The Gateshead Town Hall conference in mid-March was the only regional\nlevel meeting held to organize practical campaigning.61 In fact, most of the debates\noccurred in specially called meetings of \u2018official\u2019 labour movement organizations held\nto discuss the issue.62 The Durham County Federation of Labour Parties and Durham\nCounty Labour Women\u2019s Sections, for examples, held meetings to discuss the issue.63\nThese meetings invariably defeated Cripps\u2019s proposals. The Petition campaign clearly\nprovoked a lot more hostility than support in the North-East. Only six of the 221\ndelegates at the Durham County Labour Women\u2019s Sections emergency conference on\nthe issue voted in favour of Cripps.64 Other official organizations pronouncing against\nCripps and in favour of the NEC in the region included the Northumberland and\nTyneside Federation of Labour Parties, Newcastle City Labour Party (comprising the\nfour city constituency Labour Parties), Northumberland Labour Women\u2019s Advisory\nCouncil and Bishop Auckland, Jarrow, Wansbeck, Newcastle East and Houghton-le-\nSpring constituency Labour Parties.65 They were joined by Durham constituency\nLabour Party when it endorsed Cripps\u2019s expulsion (by seventy-one votes to twelve) in\nmid-February. The same party had supported Communist Party affiliation to Labour\nin 1936.66 Seaham MP Manny Shinwell attacked Cripps\u2019s supporters, asking if they\n\u2018realised the damage they were doing to the working-class cause\u2019.67 On the industrial\nside of the movement, Councillor J. Middleton, president of the General and Munici-\npal Workers\u2019 Northern District Council, condemned Cripps\u2019s \u2018farcical\u2019 movement,\nwhich he thought was doomed, like other \u2018rebel causes\u2019, to \u2018meet an early death\u2019.68\nThe Northumberland Colliery Mechanics mandated its delegates to support the NEC\nand several other branches of various trade unions passed resolutions supporting\nCripps\u2019s expulsion.69\n61 The conference formed a regional committee to distribute petitions and organize house\u2013to\u2013house canvassing.\nThis committee presumably came to form the North\u2013East District Petition Campaign committee with an area office\nin Newcastle. There were twelve regional committees in total.

H. MATES\nThe final measure of failure was that even in the few localities where Petition\ncampaign machinery appeared to be working and gaining a degree of popular local\nsupport, it was incapable of exerting any influence on the power-brokers in the local\nlabour movement. This influence was imperative if the policy was to emerge victori-\nous at the national Labour Party annual conference. At Bishop Auckland, the 115\nrecruited as campaign supporters managed to collect nearly 1,000 signatures for the\nPetition within two weeks, and more were still coming in. Yet this impressive figure\nhad no obvious effect on the district labour movement. Indeed, Bishop Auckland\nconstituency Labour Party expelled two of its members for supporting Cripps,\nand the locality\u2019s Petition campaign subsequently disintegrated. A thousand plus\nsignatures meant nothing to labour movement officials in the area.70\nReasons for failure: the labour movement\nUnlike the United Peace Alliance campaign of the previous year, Cripps\u2019s campaign\nhad a definite organizing centre and a figurehead.71 It also sparked more controversy\nin the North-East than did the United Peace Alliance, but it was still defeated with an\nalmost 10-1 vote against at the Labour national annual conference in late May 1939.72\nHistorians have judged harshly Cripps\u2019s conduct of the Petition campaign, and this\nclearly offers part of the explanation for its failure. First, the flaws in Cripps\u2019s Popular\nFront memorandum have been highlighted. Though adopting a largely positive\napproach to the Popular Front idea, Eatwell still argued that Cripps\u2019s memorandum\nwas understated, poorly researched and sloppily presented.73 G. D. H. Cole, who sup-\nported the Popular Front at the time, did not approve of the memorandum either.\nCole thought that Cripps weakened the Popular Front\u2019s case as he argued for it solely\non the terms of the Labour leadership, depicting it as an electoral strategy rather than\nas a device for immediately mobilizing public opinion against government foreign\npolicy. This allowed the NEC to retort that Cripps was \u2018surrendering socialism\u2019.\nMoreover, Labour accused Cripps in 1939 \u2018not without justice, of having radically\nchanged his line\u2019, a point later echoed by Ralph Miliband.74 Cripps\u2019s opposition to\nrearmament also caused problems. He had no answer to those who wondered what\nwould be used to back up the anti-appeasement foreign policy of a Popular Front\ngovernment.75 Chris Bryant highlighted the confusion in Cripps\u2019s own mind over\nexactly who was to be included in a Popular Front.76\nEatwell also criticized Cripps\u2019s tactics, citing his refusal both to consult some left-\nwingers before embarking on the campaign (such as Ellen Wilkinson) and to listen to\nthose he did consult (such as Shinwell). Cripps\u2019s choice to remain on the NEC whilst\n70 Sunday Sun, 9 Apr. 1939.\n71 G. D. H.

Cripps played into the hands of the Labour lead-\nership as he focused the campaign on himself. This allowed his opponents to depict\nhim as another Mosley with ease.77 Bryant seemed unsure of the efficacy of Cripps\u2019s\ntactics. He approved of Cripps sending his memorandum to constituency Labour\nParties as he \u2018stole a march\u2019 on the NEC, but this was ineffective as, in doing this,\nCripps alienated the NEC. In fact, this action gave the NEC an excuse to punish him\n\u2018not for what he said, but for how he had gone about saying it\u2019.78 Most agree that\nCripps\u2019s speech at Labour conference, in which he concentrated on why he should\nhave been allowed to behave as he had, rather than arguing the case for the Popular\nFront, was another tactical error.79 The tactic of collecting signatures was also flawed.\nIt required a lot of work and was ineffective. As noted above, even large numbers of\nsignatures collected appeared to have no positive impact.80 On top of this was Cripps\u2019s\ninsensitivity. Mervyn Jones has described a line from Cripps\u2019s account of his ten week\nholiday in Jamaica in Tribune as \u2018perhaps the most tactless sentence ever to appear\nin a left-wing paper\u2019.81 Raymond Challinor has also criticized Cripps\u2019s personal\nconduct.82 Those opposing Cripps in the North-East certainly employed many of\nthese arguments, especially the claim that Cripps\u2019s wealth allowed him to pursue a\ncampaign that most in the party would not be able to afford.83\nIn addition to these problems were the weaknesses in Cripps\u2019s organization. Eatwell\nhas argued that Cripps\u2019s petition organization was under-funded, badly organized\nand inefficient. Whilst there were 321 local Petition Committees by the end of April\n1939 and 450 in two-thirds of all constituencies in Britain by mid-May, many of these\nwere nominal and a third were concentrated in London.84 These organizational weak-\nnesses were reflected in the North-East. Though the number of Petition Committees\nin the region is uncertain, evidence exists for at least four, in Bishop Auckland,\nNewcastle, Durham and South Shields. It is conceivable that these were the only four\nin the region: there were only seven in the whole of South Wales, a region that, owing\nto the relative domination of the Communist Party, provided far more support for the\nPopular Front than the North-East.85 Yet, as has been seen, Cripps\u2019s organization\nseems to have functioned relatively well in Bishop Auckland.\n77 Burgess echoed Eatwell\u2019s criticisms. Eatwell, thesis, pp. 308\u201337; Burgess, Stafford Cripps, pp. 119\u201329.\n78 Bryant, Stafford Cripps, p. 171.\n79 For examples, Cole, Labour Party, p. 359 and Bryant, Stafford Cripps, p. 181. However, Cooke thought\nCripps\u2019s choice of subject matter was wise. Cooke also praised Cripps for the work he put into the campaign.\nCooke, Life of Richard Stafford Cripps, pp. 231\u201338.\n80 Even if constituency Labour Parties had been won over in significant numbers, there remained the problem\nof forcing the NEC to act. Despite massive labour movement support for a national conference in 1938, the NEC\nrefused to act and there seemed to be little local labour movement organizations could do. They could, of course,\ndisaffiliate in protest and enter the political wilderness as the ILP had done in 1931. However, this would have been\na very drastic \u2018solution\u2019 and very unlikely to happen as these constituency Labour Parties generally did not have the\nideological problems with the NEC that the ILP had had. Despite the fact that more constituency representatives\nhad been allowed on the NEC from 1937, it is remarkable how little practical control the constituency parties still\nhad over the national party leadership. It was even more remarkable that they put up with this situation. That they\ndid was a testament to their strong loyalty to the movement. Mates, thesis, pp. 184\u201386.\n81 M.

H. MATES\nHowever, it would be wrong to attribute too much importance to these particular\nfactors. By laying the blame for failure of the Popular Front in 1939 at Cripps\u2019s feet,\nthe implication is that the project could have been successful, had it not been for\nCripps. This was not the case. The failure of Cripps\u2019s campaign in the North-East can\nbe attributed to the same wider factors that ensured that the United Peace Alliance\ndid not receive significant north-east labour movement support in 1938. Indeed,\nCripps failed even to mobilize the support that the United Peace Alliance managed in\nMay 1938. This, arguably, may have had something to do with Cripps\u2019s particular\nprogramme and a way of behaving which alienated some in the region. This is\nunlikely, however, as Cripps was popular enough for the DMA to vote him as a\nspeaker at its gala in 1939. The timing of Cripps\u2019s campaign was crucial. Previously\nsupportive, the Co-operative Party and Liberals were either opposed to the Popular\nFront or lukewarm by spring 1939. There was also a rift between Liberals and Labour\nover conscription in early 1939, with Labour opposed and the Liberals in favour. In\naddition, Eatwell has claimed that a decrease in public interest in foreign affairs in\nspring 1939 meant that the Petition campaign came too late to capitalize on the after-\nmath of Munich. The anger felt by some at the Munich \u2018betrayal\u2019 had become confu-\nsion and apathy. In fact, the increased resolution of the government on foreign policy\nand its apparent distancing of itself from appeasement after Hitler\u2019s invasion of\nCzechoslovakia led to an increase in its popularity by April 1939.86 The timing of\nevents in Spain was also potentially important. The primary purpose of the Popular\nFront, argued Michael Foot, was to save \u2018Spain\u2019. When Franco marched into Madrid\nin March 1939, \u2018there was no longer a Spain to save\u2019.87 The fall of the Spanish Repub-\nlic must have dissipated some of the Petition campaign\u2019s impetus, though, for reasons\ndiscussed below, this effect was minimal.\nUltimately, the Cripps campaign failed for the underlying reasons that the United\nPeace Alliance had not gathered significant support in the region the previous year. A\nkey consideration was loyalty. A national party statement, The Labour Party and the\nPopular Front, ended with the claim that the success of a political party depended on\nthe loyalty and staying power of its members, and this had a strong resonance in the\nregion.88 The north-east labour movement was particularly noted for its loyalty, and it\ndid not appear to falter in the late 1930s. In early May 1938, the Durham County\nFederation of Labour Parties (DCFLP) unanimously accepted the NEC\u2019s report that\nthe Labour Party should not associate with political bodies that did not share its\npolicy (i.e. Liberals and Communists in a Popular Front). \u2018However desirable, the\nexpressed objects [of the Popular Front] can best be pursued within the ranks of our\nParty, as apart from the elementary principle of loyalty, the diffusion of effort and\nfinance involved must inevitably weaken our organization\u2019, the DCFLP told its affili-\nates.89 These considerations were paramount in informing the attitudes of regional\nlabour movement leaders.\n86 Eatwell, thesis, pp. 364\u201368. James Hinton argued that Chamberlain\u2019s apparent abandonment of appeasement in\nspring 1939 was \u2018a victory of sorts\u2019 for the Popular Front agitation as it had as much to do with fear of a Conserva-\ntive rebellion as any genuine rethinking of foreign policy.

In spring 1938, the union demonstrated its\nloyalty to Labour by overwhelmingly supporting an executive proposal to make a\ndonation of \u00a35,000 to the party (the lodge vote was 843:35 in favour). This was\nclaimed to be the largest single contribution to the party by any one labour movement\nbody.90 Nothing occurred in 1938 or 1939 that shook the firm belief within the DMA\nthat Labour alone was capable of righting the deteriorating situation. What was this\nloyalty based on? It is unlikely that it was based on fear. The NEC did not discipline\nnorth-east activists who openly supported the Popular Front in 1938, and only a\nhandful of the main activists were expelled or threatened with such in 1939. If it was\nbased on fear of the consequences of stepping out of line, then the fear was largely\nunfounded. As argued below, loyalty was also not based on satisfaction with the\nnational leadership. Loyalty to Labour in the region was not blind and certainly did\nnot accept everything the national leadership did or did not do. Rather, it appears\nto have been based on the belief that the labour movement was the best method of\npursuing the interests of its members, regardless, and sometimes in spite of, the\nleadership.\nThe attitudes of important individuals in the regional labour movement suggest\nother reasons for the Popular Front\u2019s unpopularity. Some north-east Labour MPs\nseemed uninterested in foreign affairs. The awful economic problems of their con-\nstituents were a far greater concern. Others displayed complacency regarding the\ninternational situation.91 However, these attitudes were not representative of the rank-\nand-file, many of whom were active on Spain.92 Notwithstanding this, the Popular\nFront remained fundamentally an expression of radical liberalism. This is significant\nin explaining its lack of support in the North-East. 93 Moreover, it proposed an\nalliance with Communists and Liberals, both of whom offended large sections of\nthe north-east labour movement. In March 1938, for example, William Maclean\n(Wansbeck Labour parliamentary candidate) rejected \u2018new alliances to left or right\u2019 as\nthey made for \u2018parliamentary weakness\u2019. 94 This was despite Maclean\u2019s own constitu-\nency being a Conservative seat in this period. Alliances demanded compromise too.\nAs one regional commentator wrote:\nPopular Front is the wrong name. UnPopular Front is truer. [. . .] Any party which stands\nfor certain definite principles will find that many of those principles will have to be thrown\noverboard if it is necessary to curry favour with supporters from other parties\u2019.95\n90 Durham Chronicle, 7 Jan., 18 Feb. 1938.\n91 Examples of the first type are Tom Sexton, MP (Barnard Castle) and Joe Batey, MP (Spennymoor).

H. MATES\nThe regional labour movement was more ambivalent than openly hostile to\nCommunists. North-East Labour leaders spent very little time condemning the\ndoctrine and its practitioners. Instead, opposition to communism was manifest in the\ndistinct lack of \u2018official\u2019 (i.e. non-Communist) regional labour movement support for\nall Communist ventures. The Communist Party remained relatively small and lacked\ninfluence in the region. Its logistical ability to advance its policies, such as the Popular\nFront, was consequently highly limited.96 The party was unattractive to Labour for\npractical reasons too. It had very little electoral influence in the region and certainly\nnot enough to win Labour a marginal seat. In fact, regional Labour leaders regarded\nCommunist support as more of a vote loser.97 However, there was no evidence that\nevents in the Soviet Union, particularly the \u2018Show Trials\u2019, had any effect on attitudes\nwithin the \u2018official\u2019 north-east labour movement, as they had elsewhere.98 Regarding\nthe North-East District Communist Party, there is no evidence of opposition to the\nPopular Front policy. The regional party attempted to advocate and pursue the policy\nas much as its meagre resources would allow. There was equally no obvious disquiet\nfrom Communists in the region at the signing of the Hitler-Stalin non-aggression pact\nin August 1939.99\nFor the \u2018official\u2019 labour movement, a potential alliance with Liberals spawned\na considerable number of additional reasons to oppose the Popular Front. These\nwere emphasized by the national Labour leadership and strongly resonated in the\nNorth-East. Jupp has claimed that NEC attacks on non-socialists and the idea of\nclass collaboration \u2018probably aroused more sympathy among the party membership\n[. . .]\u2019.100 In proposing the Popular Front the left \u2018broke with the tradition of the labour\nmovement. According to this tradition independence from the other two major parties\nwas the reason for the existence of the Labour Party\u2019.101 The Liberal Party was not the\nelectoral force it once had been. The Liberal Party received its lowest ever vote in the\n1935 general election. In 1936, Liberals only had 189 constituency associations and\nless than a third of these were active.102 Because of the existence of local electoral pacts\nbetween Liberals and Conservatives, it is difficult to determine where Liberals were\nactive in north-east local elections in the late 1930s. If the 1935 general election is an\naccurate reflection of Liberal strength in the region, then Liberals only had a signifi-\ncant presence in Barnard Castle and Bishop Auckland in the south of County\nDurham, and South Shields and Tynemouth on the Tyne.103 Tactically, Labour was\nvery unlikely to want an alliance with parties that were not as influential as they had\nbeen in the past (especially as Labour won three of these four north-east seats in\n1935).\n96 Although the regional Communist Party appeared broadly supportive of the Popular Front strategy, residual\nsectarianism within it also acted against the policy\u2019s advancement.\n97 Mates, thesis, pp. 53\u201356.\n98 Murphy, thesis, pp. 386, 403.\n99 See Lewis H.

A Liberal stronghold before the First World War, the region\nwas divided between supporters of the National Government and Labour after\n1935.105 Electoral expediency in the North-East meant that Popular Front supporters\nwere always going to have problems convincing the labour movement in County\nDurham. As Ellen Wilkinson admitted in January 1939, the situation in County\nDurham was \u2018not so serious because of the strong position the party holds in that\narea\u2019.106 Of the fifteen County Durham seats covered in this article (Sunderland was\na two-member constituency) Labour won twelve in 1935.107 In 1935, thirteen of the\nfifteen election contests in County Durham were straight fights. Of these, one was\nbetween Labour and Liberal (Bishop Auckland) and the rest were between Labour\nand National Government candidates. A Popular Front pact would have meant no\nLiberal opposition in Bishop Auckland, but Labour won there anyway. In the other\nstraight fights, there is no indication that a Liberal alliance with Labour would have\nhelped the party. In fact, where Liberals stood as an independent third party it seems\nto have benefited Labour by taking votes from the Conservatives, for example in\nBarnard Castle in 1935. In 1931, Labour lost in a straight fight to the Conservatives in\nthe seat. In 1935, the Labour share of the vote increased from 44.7 per cent to 49.8 per\ncent, the Conservative vote decreasing from 55.3 per cent to 44.2 per cent. The Liberal\nsecured just 6.1 per cent, but this appears to have been at the expense of the Conser-\nvative. This suggests that when not given the choice of a Liberal candidate, Liberal\nvoters generally opted for Conservatives rather than Labour in the region. G. L.\nDodds has claimed that, with the collapse of the local Liberal Party, the Conserva-\ntives received the Liberal vote, thereby winning the two Sunderland seats in 1931.108\nThe case of South Shields also revealed that the presence of three parties helped\nLabour. In 1931, there was a straight fight between Liberal and Labour, the Liberal\nwinning with 59.8 per cent. In 1935, a National Labour candidate received 23.6 per\ncent of the vote, most of which must have come from the Liberal who took 28.3 per\ncent. This allowed Labour to win the seat on 48.1 per cent. There was no guarantee\nthat, in the absence of a Liberal candidate in South Shields, Liberal voters would vote\nLabour if their party were aligned with it in a pact. The two South Shields results\nsuggest that much of the Liberal vote in 1931 was in fact Conservative and that, with\na section of Liberals again an independent electoral force, this divided the anti-\nLabour vote. The evidence of Barnard Castle and South Shields suggests that Hugh\nDalton was right to argue that it was unlikely that a Lib\/Lab pact would have\ninduced many Liberals voters to vote Labour.109\n104 Eatwell, thesis, p. 194.\n105 For details, see A.

Thus, when arguing\nfor the Popular Front at a Sunderland Communist crusade meeting Reg Bishop could only really cite the town as an\nexample of one which should be a \u2018backbone Labour seat\u2019, but which could not be won by Labour without progres-\nsive support. This contention was by no means certain, however. Daily Worker (first edition), 20 Feb. 1939.\n108 G. L.

H. MATES\nLabour was far weaker in Northumberland, winning only one of nine seats in the\ncounty. Ostensibly, the practical electoral case for the Popular Front in Northumber-\nland was far stronger. Yet only at Tynemouth was there a possibility that anti-\ngovernment forces could benefit from electoral unity. From 1922, Liberals and Labour\nsecured a little less than a third of the vote each, allowing the Conservative victory\non a minority vote. Again, though, it is not certain that the absence of a Liberal\ncandidate would have induced Liberals to vote Labour. (If Liberal voters behaved\nlike Liberal activists in the town, discussed below, then most of the Liberal vote would\nhave gone to the Conservatives). Equally, it is not clear what Labour voters would\nhave done if a Popular Front Liberal candidate had stood. Elsewhere in Northumber-\nland, Labour fought only government candidates, winning Morpeth. In the seven\nstraight fights that Labour lost to government candidates north of the Tyne, the\npresence of Liberal candidates, as at Barnard Castle, could well have helped them by\ntaking votes from the Conservatives. Of course, Popular Front supporters could cite\nthe national picture in arguing their case, or assert that the Popular Front was about\ncreating a mass anti-government movement immediately, rather than a simple elec-\ntoral pact at election time. Had the electoral situation in the North-East suggested\nmore strongly that a Liberal-Labour pact would be advantageous, this could only\nhave assisted Popular Front advocates. Yet, as with Labour electoral co-operation\nwith Communists, if there was no ideological commitment to a pact, then even an\nextremely strong practical case would have had little or no effect.110\nRegardless of these considerations, the situation for Labour in the North-East was\nevidently not hopeless. The Popular Front seemed defeatist, especially in a region\nwhere Labour was far from defeated. The anti-Popular Front DCFLP circular was\nupbeat when it appealed \u2018earnestly to our organizations to plan for victory [and] to\nextend their efforts\u2019.111 Like West Yorkshire, the North-East was an industrial area\nwhere Labour was dominant in many localities and wedded to the idea of remaining\nan independent force.112 The fear that a Popular Front would actually stimulate a\nLiberal revival must also have characterized the attitudes of some regional labour\nmovement leaders, who regarded Lib\/Lab pacts as a discredited tactic.\nAs noted above, the fall of the Spanish Republic in March 1939 must have had\nsome effect in disillusioning Petition campaign supporters in the labour movement.\nHowever, generally speaking, far from galvanizing greater support for the Popular\nFront, the urgent situation in Spain acted as a distraction from it.113 The distraction\nof \u2018Spain\u2019 is vividly illustrated by the stark contrast between the level of labour\nmovement support secured by Cripps\u2019s and the Tyneside foodship campaigns, which\nwere running concurrently. Trevelyan and other left-wing Cripps supporters, such\n110 Mates, thesis, pp. 182\u201383.\n111 Durham Chronicle, 6 May 1938.\n112 Murphy, thesis, pp. 382\u201387, 411, 440.\n113 Of course, in some cases, this worked the other way round. For example, Trevelyan decided to donate \u00a3100 to\nCripps\u2019s Petition campaign in Feb. 1939, instead of giving it, as he had previously intended, to support a plan for\nsending raw materials to Spain. Highly impressed by Cripps\u2019s plan, Trevelyan thought that \u2018to fundamentally alter\nthe position here and really threaten our government would be a bigger help to Spain than anything\u2019. However,\nTrevelyan represented a small minority of labour movement opinion. NRL, CPTEX133, C.P.

There had been an equally clear illustration of\nthe distraction the conflict provided in 1938. Labour\u2019s change in national attitude\nfrom supporting the government\u2019s policy of non-intervention in Spain in 1936 to\nadvocacy of the Republic\u2019s right to buy arms in 1937 had not placated many\ngrassroots activists. Disquiet at the national leadership\u2019s inactivity on the issue and\nother foreign policy concerns was manifest in calls for an emergency national labour\nmovement conference on Spain or the general international situation. By mid-1938,\nalmost the entire north-east labour movement had expressed its desire for such a con-\nference. (Owing to a change in the timing of the national Labour Party conference,\nnone was scheduled for 1938).115 Indeed, in June 1938 a conference of the North-East\nFederation of Trades Councils, Northumberland and Tyneside Federation of Labour\nParties and Co-operative Party went as far as to call for a national labour movement\nconference \u2018to formulate industrial and political action to remove the Chamberlain gov-\nernment\u2019 [my emphasis].116 This apparent desire to discuss the possibility of industrial\ndirect action to place pressure on the government momentarily placed the regional\nmovement far to the left of the constitution-obsessed national leadership.\nHowever, the evident grassroots disaffection at the national leadership\u2019s refusal\nto organize a conference did not impel constituency Labour Parties in regions like\nthe North-East into supporting the Popular Front. This almost complete inability to\ncapitalize on discontent within the official labour movement rank-and-file suggests\na further reason for the Popular Front\u2019s failure. Popular Fronters could not openly\nadvocate mass industrial direct action for political ends for fear of scaring away\npotential support from Liberals and the middle class in general. Consequently, for a\nsubstantial part of the official labour movement rank-and-file, including much of the\nsupposedly \u2018moderate\u2019 and \u2018loyal\u2019 North-East, the Popular Front policy was simply\n\u2018too Liberal\u2019 to have any appeal. This was especially problematic for the Communist\nParty. Its support for the Popular Front forced it to tone down previous policies and\nrhetoric at a time when open advocacy of industrial direct action could have had a\n114 In retrospect, Trevelyan wasted his money on Cripps\u2019s campaign. However, by February 1939, little short of\nextensive British and French military intervention on the side of the Republic could have saved it. Foodships were\ntoo little and too late, and the number who saw them as aiding the Republic against fascism as opposed to simply\nproviding succour to starving and innocent civilians is also unclear.

MATES\nsignificant resonance within the official labour movement, in the North-East and else-\nwhere.117 Arguably, support for the Popular Front actually cost the Communist Party\na degree of influence within the labour movement in the North-East.\nIn the North-East, interest in the Popular Front peaked in early summer 1938, at\nthe same time as clamour from regional labour movement organizations for a\nnational labour movement conference on Spain and the \u2018international situation\u2019\n(though the latter was far more supported than the former). In the aftermath of\nMunich, support for a Popular Front in the North-East appeared less than in summer\n1938. Even at its peak, this support was insignificant.118 Thus, even if Cripps had\nlaunched his campaign at an earlier, more propitious moment, it is highly doubtful\nthat he would have secured significantly more support in the North-East and\nelsewhere.\nIn attacking the Popular Front in March 1938, William Maclean mentioned\nanother significant consideration. He argued that \u2018there can exist many approaches\nand many angles of vision\u2019 within the Labour Party, making it \u2018in the true sense, a\nPopular Front\u2019.119 Thus, one of the reasons that Labour did not need a Popular Front\nwas because, in some senses, it already was one. As the Labour educationalist, R. H.\nTawney, recognized in 1932, the Labour Party was clearly a cross-class alliance: \u2018If\nvariety of educational experience and economic conditions among its active support-\ners be the tests, the Labour Party is, whether fortunately or not, as a mere matter\nof fact, less of a class party than any other British party.\u2019120 Generally speaking,\nMaclean\u2019s attitude appeared representative of the majority in the North-East. He\napproved of a diverse Labour Party and was implicitly critical of the NEC when\nhe said \u2018unity is strength, but unity does not mean rigid regimentation and heresy\nhunting\u2019.121 There was very little witch hunting in the north-east against Popular\nFront supporters. Indeed, the region was a good deal more tolerant of its heretics\nthan the national movement.122 Yet, like the vast regional majority, Maclean did not\nsupport the Popular Front itself.\nThe very level of bickering and disputes within the regional movement in the period\nalso testifies to its diversity.123 Internal division was a further factor that worked\nagainst those seeking an alliance with outside forces. It was difficult enough ensuring\nsome semblance of internal unity without the added complications of securing alli-\nances with other parties. Roger Eatwell has argued that a Popular Front could have\nbeen mobilized around Labour\u2019s Immediate Programme. It was moderate and would\nnot have alienated potential supporters from the right such as Liberals. This would\nalso have precluded Labour objections that the movement was not socialist.124 Yet it\n117 National leaders with a power base in the North\u2013East predictably ruled out the use of industrial action for\npolitical ends. At a Durham County Labour delegate conference after Munich, Dalton argued that a general strike\ncould not be used to bring the government \u2018to its senses\u2019 as this was not democratic.

As noted above, the\nleadership resisted calls for a national conference despite considerable pressure. Still,\nit was more likely to listen to its own members than to Liberals and others outside the\nparty. The labour movement was already very broad in social and political terms. It\ncould accommodate those who desired a stronger stand against the fascist powers and\nwere able to accept its moderate domestic polices. Furthermore, it excluded Commu-\nnists (at least theoretically if not necessarily in practice), which would have repelled\nmany to the right of Labour.\nThe \u2018Capitalists\u2019: North-East Liberal and Conservative attitudes\nCripps\u2019s 1939 campaign aimed primarily at galvanizing support for the Popular Front\ninside the labour movement as most Popular Fronters agreed on the need for Labour\nParty leadership of the project. Still, Liberal support, especially, was required if the\nidea was to work. In theory, north-east Liberal support should have been forthcom-\ning. The party\u2019s foreign policy was similar to Labour\u2019s and important national Liberal\nParty figures such as the party leader, Archibald Sinclair, and the MPs Wilfred\nRoberts, Geoffrey Mander and Sir Richard Acland supported the Popular Front\nsince 1936. Vernon Bartlett, who won the Bridgwater by-election as an independent\nprogressive in November 1938, was also a Liberal. Many significant north-east Liber-\nals echoed their party\u2019s stance on foreign relations, calling for the establishment of a\nsystem of international \u2018collective security\u2019 that included Soviet Russia.126 However,\nthere was very little direct evidence of north-east Liberal involvement in the United\nPeace Alliance campaign. There were an indeterminate number of \u2018progressive organi-\nzations\u2019 outside the labour movement represented at a campaign conference in the\nregion in May 1938, the same month as the Liberal Party nationally backed the\nstrategy. However, the only organization that was definitely represented and probably\ncontained Liberals (and which itself represented the Popular Front in microcosm) was\nthe Left Book Club. None of the high profile regional politicians who endorsed this\nconference were Liberals. Only one north-east Liberal organization, Newcastle West\nLiberal Association, obviously supported the Liberal Party\u2019s renewed national\nendorsement of the Popular Front in the wake of Munich. Even then, there was no\nindication that Liberals in Newcastle West acted on the resolution by attempting to\nbuild links with Labour in the town.127\n125 This was what people such as Attlee thought. Swift argued that Attlee was reasonable to suggest that Liberals\nand the Communist Party, as smaller parties, should drop their differences with Labour and not the other way\nround. J.

Phillips, then secretary of the Northern Liberal Federation and chairholder of\nNewcastle Central constituency, spoke at Newcastle urging a mutual assistance pact between \u2018peaceful countries\nincluding Russia\u2019. Phillips saw Germany as the \u2018centre of disturbance in Europe\u2019 as \u2018she desired those things that\ncould only be achieved through war, and was content to attain them through war\u2019.

H. MATES\nNorth-East Liberals were equally un-supportive of the Popular Front in 1939. The\nnational Liberal organization told Liberal Associations that there would be no official\nparticipation in Cripps\u2019s campaign, but that individual Liberals could participate.\nIn the North-East only one \u2018Liberal\u2019 figure appeared to have been involved. Enid\nAtkinson, a member of Lloyd George\u2019s grandly titled grouping, the \u2018Council of\nAction for Peace and Reconstruction\u2019, addressed a \u2018Petition Campaign\u2019 conference in\nGateshead.128 However, the minuscule \u2018Council of Action\u2019 was the only \u2018Liberal\u2019 body\nthat obviously supported the Popular Front in the North-East, and it was not even\nstrictly aligned with the Liberal Party.129 Moreover, this support was not new in 1938.\n\u2018Council of Action\u2019 activists had been active with labour movement leftists in the\nnorth-east peace councils (Tyneside Joint Peace Council and Sunderland and District\nPeace Council) since 1936.130 The only other direct evidence of Liberal support\ncame in Bishop Auckland where another indeterminate number signed the Cripps\nPetition.131\nOf the significant north-east Liberals, Raymond Jones, parliamentary candidate for\nSouth Shields, went the closest to supporting the Popular Front in 1939. He told his\nconstituency party annual meeting in February 1939 that \u2018It was high time there was\na change of government in this country. The Labour Party was so engrossed in seek-\ning a socialist state that it preferred to risk a continuance of the present government\nrather than join hands with any other party in defeating it\u2019.132 This was significant as,\nbefore 1939, Jones spent as much time attacking Labour as the government.133 How-\never, Jones did not mention the Popular Front at all in this speech in February 1939.\nPeculiarly, Jones\u2019 solution to the problem of the government\u2019s foreign policy and\nLabour\u2019s commitment to a socialist state was that one hundred Liberals were needed\nin Parliament as a \u2018safeguard\u2019.134 Not surprisingly, he played no part in the Cripps\nagitation. Other Liberals were more sympathetic towards the government. In April\n1939, for example, M. R. Shankcross (secretary of the Northern Liberal Federation)\nsaid that Liberals would support the government \u2018so long as it continues with the\npolicy of collective security\u2019. While Shankcross argued that the present problematic\nsituation was attributable to the government\u2019s foreign policy, he still thought that\n\u2018this was not the time for recriminations\u2019.135 The country was, he considered, now\nunited \u2018left to right\u2019 behind the government.\n128 Tribune, 3 Mar. 1939. Lloyd George established the \u2018Council of Action\u2019 in summer 1935 to promote his \u2018new\ndeal\u2019 proposals to tackle unemployment and promote peace. Although professing to be \u2018non\u2013party\u2019, the \u2018Council\nof Action\u2019 was designed to concert efforts to secure a parliament pledged to a progressive policy based on the\nproposals. Nationally, \u2018Council of Action\u2019 branches formed the basis of Petition Committees in some localities.\nP. Rowland, Lloyd George (1975), pp. 713\u201323; F. Owen, Tempestuous Journey. Lloyd George His Life and Times\n(1954), pp. 726\u201345; Eatwell, thesis, pp. 111, 225, 267, 341\u201342.\n129 The \u2018Council of Action\u2019 nationally was a small organization and this was reflected in the North\u2013East. The \u2018north\narea\u2019 \u2018Council of Action\u2019 appears to have been a small group of middle\u2013class radicals. Nationally, there was a\nfeeling within the \u2018Council of Action\u2019 that it had done well out of its involvement in the Spain and China relief\ncampaigns and the Cripps Petition campaign, which facilitated the recruitment of some disillusioned Labour Party\nmembers. It is uncertain if this occurred in the North\u2013East. Certainly the names connected with the \u2018Council of\nAction\u2019 in the regional press in 1939 were largely the same as in 1936.

Thus the Popular\nFront programme, based on radical Liberal foreign policy concerns and neglecting\ndomestic policies where Liberal and Labour most diverged, must not have posed a\nproblem in itself. However, there were practical reasons why an electoral alliance was\nproblematic for Liberals. Roger Eatwell has claimed that many Liberals in the North\nopposed the Popular Front as they feared that an alliance would ultimately lead to\nthe eclipse of the party.136 This was the opposite of the argument used by Labour\nParty opponents of the Popular Front who feared that it might provoke a Liberal\nrevival. Both arguments were plausible, depending on the workings of any putative\nelectoral pact. Liberal fears of being eclipsed certainly could be justified in the North-\nEast. In 1935, the only north-east Liberal MP lost to Labour in a straight fight at\nBishop Auckland, and there were Liberal candidates in only three other north-east\nconstituencies. Assuming that the Popular Front party with the best placed candidate\nin 1935 would automatically choose the candidate at a future general election, there\nwould have been no Liberal candidates in the region.137 However, Liberal Popular\nFront supporters could have argued that the party, without an alliance with Labour,\nwould not win a seat in the region anyway. Moreover, it was possible that an electoral\nagreement would force Labour to stand down in a north-east constituency and allow\nthe Liberal a free run. This scenario must have informed Labour fears of a Liberal\nrevival.138\nOther aspects of the Popular Front that alienated Labour Party members applied\nequally to Liberals. Many did not wish to ally with Communists for the same reasons,\nand because Communists theoretically proposed to end capitalism. As with north-east\nlabour movement attitudes, there was no evidence that the Moscow Show Trials\nworsened the image of the Communist Party in the eyes of Liberals. Communism was\ntheoretical anathema to liberalism and that was sufficient.\nYet, for many north-east Liberals, socialism was little different. Tynemouth was\nparticularly significant in this context. The local labour movement was weak there,\nwhile liberalism remained relatively strong.139 As noted above, a roughly equal three-\nway split vote gave the Conservatives victory on a minority vote. Tynemouth Labour\nParty supported the Popular Front by 1939. At least one important local Liberal,\nCouncillor Stanley Holmes, appeared sympathetic to co-operation with the left.140\nHowever, Tynemouth Liberals regarded the Conservatives as their natural allies. An\n\u2018anti-socialist\u2019 pact existed in the town between Conservatives and Liberals before\n136 Eatwell, thesis, pp. 206, 279.\n137 In 1935 the Liberal Party came closest to Labour in the region at Tynemouth. Liberals polled relatively well in\nSouth Shields in 1935 (28.3 per cent), but Labour won this seat with 48.1 per cent.\n138 It was possible that the pact would entail \u2018progressive\u2019 candidatures instead of using party labels. This created\nscenarios that could be used to support both Liberal fears of eclipse and Labour fears of a Liberal revival. Whether\n\u2018progressive\u2019 candidatures could have mobilized the majority of both Labour and Liberal votes must remain a\nmatter for speculation.\n139 As recently as 1930, Tynemouth was one of five boroughs in Britain where Liberals were still the largest party\n(with eighteen of the thirty\u2013six councillors). C. Cook, \u2018Liberals, Labour and Elections\u2019, in The Politics of\nReappraisal, ed. G. Peele and C. Cook (1975), p. 170.\n140 Holmes, who was Tynemouth Liberal parliamentary candidate in the 1931 and 1935 general elections, sup-\nported a local Communist-organized anti-Means Test March in mid-October 1936 and appeared on a Tyneside\nJoint Peace Council platform in November 1936.

In practice, the pact did not work well in Tynemouth. Both Liberals and Con-\nservatives assumed the \u2018Moderate\u2019 label at municipal elections, but they still stood\nagainst other Moderates.141 The parties made unsuccessful efforts to remedy this\nsituation in 1936 and had a scare in December when a Communist, standing against\nno fewer than five Moderate candidates, was eighteen votes short of winning a by-\nelection seat.142 In February 1937, the president of Tynemouth Ratepayers\u2019 Associa-\ntion warned that \u2018unless the Moderate forces combine and show a united front, it\nwill be inevitable that the Communist and Socialist forces will obtain command in\nthis town also\u2019.143 Attempts to establish a firmer electoral understanding continued\nthroughout spring 1937. However, eventually the Liberals refused to finalize arrange-\nments with Conservatives owing to a \u2018bitter feeling\u2019 and divisions continued in the\n1937 and 1938 municipal elections.144 There remained a desire within Tynemouth\nLiberal circles for a degree of autonomy in an area where they remained relatively\nstrong. Notwithstanding this, the situation in Tynemouth supported Hugh Dalton\u2019s\ncase against the Popular Front. Dalton argued that the Liberal vote was more\nlikely to go to Labour in constituencies where both Liberals and Labour were weak\nand where even a combined vote could not defeat the Conservative. However, in con-\nstituencies where Labour \u2018grows strong, Liberals have a habit [. . .] of entering into\ncompacts with Conservatives [. . .] to \u201ckeep Labour out\u201d\u2019.145 Labour remained weak\non Tynemouth municipal council, but had, for the first time, come second to the\nConservatives in the constituency in the 1935 general election, usurping the Liberals.\n(The Liberals secured 23.1 per cent with Labour gaining 29.8 per cent). When the\nTynemouth Ratepayers\u2019 Association spokesman implied that Labour and Commu-\nnists represented a combined electoral threat, despite Labour in the town not being\ninterested in allying with Communists, it is likely he was expressing a genuinely held\npolitical perspective (rather than disingenuously attempting to discredit Labour with\nthe electorate).146\nFurthermore, it seems Tynemouth Liberals\u2019 attitudes characterized those of\nthe majority of north-east Liberals. Nationally, anti-Labour electoral pacts between\nLiberals and Conservatives began when Labour started to have an impact in local\nelections after 1918 and such pacts had been agreed in virtually all north-east towns\nby 1930. This proliferation of local \u2018anti-socialist\u2019 electoral pacts in the region, most\nof which worked far better than that at Tynemouth, suggests a strong ideological\naspect to Liberal attitudes in the North-East. Liberals identified themselves with Con-\nservatives, who were also capitalists, rather than with Labour, which they regarded,\n141 The case of Tynemouth thus contradicts Cook\u2019s claim that that no Moderates stood against each other in the\nperiod as Liberals could not afford to act outside of these pacts. In fact, split Moderate votes occurred at\nTynemouth throughout the early nineteen-thirties. In 1934 Moderates stood against each other and Labour or\nCommunist candidates in four wards. However, this did not happen in 1935. Evening Chronicle, 2 Nov. 1934; 2 Nov.\n1935; Cook in Peele and Cook, Politics of Reappraisal, p. 179.\n142 Shields News, 7, 8 Oct., 6, 13 Nov., 3 Dec. 1936; North Mail, 24 Oct., 3 Nov., 3 Dec. 1936; Evening Chronicle,\n3 Nov. 1936.\n143 This was an overstatement. Moderates dominated Tynemouth council and there was very little chance that their\ncontrol could be threatened by Labour, whether combined with Communists or not, in the near future.

Thus Eatwell\u2019s claim that Liberals could have been brought\ninto a Popular Front based around Labour\u2019s Immediate Programme is very doubtful\nfor north-east Liberals. Regardless of whether the programme was \u2018socialist\u2019, north-\neast Liberals were likely to have perceived it as such and therefore opposed it. This\nwas Liberal \u2018loyalty\u2019: not to the party as such, but to Liberal principles. As these\nolder established patterns of thinking and behaving appeared well entrenched in the\nNorth-East, it was consequently highly unlikely that there would have been any local\nelectoral arrangements between anti-government parties in the region in the event of\na general election. Eatwell noted that national Labour leaders could not cite Liberal\nopposition to the Popular Front as an argument against it.148 However, the anti-\nsocialist attitude of most north-east Liberals provided regional Labour leaders with\nyet another argument against the Popular Front, should they have cared to use it.\nThere was another aspect of the more \u2018conservative\u2019 nature of north-east Liberal-\nism.149 The National Liberal Party in the region was much stronger than its \u2018indepen-\ndent\u2019 equivalent. In 1935, there were National Liberal candidates in five north-east\nconstituencies. They were successful in Sunderland, Gateshead and Newcastle East\nand defeated in straight fights with Labour in Consett and Durham. Thus, the major-\nity of north-east Liberals had chosen to stay with the National Government. Already\ninvolved in a parliamentary pact with Conservatives, these Liberals therefore would\nbe very difficult, if not impossible, to attract to a pact with Labour (especially as none\nof them seemed to have any problems with Chamberlain\u2019s foreign policy; see below).\nAs argued above, Liberal voters in the North-East appear to have been largely on the\nright of the Liberal political spectrum too. As general election results in Barnard\nCastle constituency showed, they tended to vote Conservative, rather than Labour in\nthe absence of a Liberal candidate.\nThe only direct evidence of rank-and-file Conservative\/National Liberal support\nfor the Popular Front in the North-East was the indeterminate number of National\nGovernment supporters who apparently signed the Cripps Petition at Bishop\nAuckland.150 Dissent at government foreign policy was a necessary starting point for\n147 For example, the pact at Newcastle: Cook was broadly correct to cite Newcastle as an example of where Mod-\nerates did not stand against each other, although the situation was complicated by the presence of \u2018Independents\u2019,\n\u2018Moderates\u2019, \u2018Progressives\u2019 and \u2018Municipal Reformers\u2019 all standing in different numbers at each election. Cook in\nPeele and Cook, Politics of Reappraisal, pp. 169\u201370, 178\u201379.\n148 Eatwell argued that there was likely to have been between thirty and fifty such agreements in Britain. Thus, the\nPopular Front could well have secured some kind of success. Eatwell made little of this important point. Eatwell,\nthesis, pp. 205\u20138, 214\u201316, 376.\n149 This was not a new development. B. E. Naylor claimed that the Liberal Party in the North\u2013East was to the right\nof the party nationally in the Edwardian period. For this reason, more progressive Liberals joined the ILP, which in\nturn placed the ILP to the right of the party nationally. This partly explains why the Labour Party in the region\nbecame a \u2018bastion of right wing labourism\u2019. B. E. Naylor, \u2018Ramsay Macdonald and Seaham Labour Politics\u2019,\nBulletin of the North\u2013East Group for the Study of Labour History, 15 (1981), 30\u201331.\n150 Tribune, 6 Apr. 1939. There were eleven National Government MPs in the North\u2013East after 1935: eight Conser-\nvatives and three National Liberals. The National Labour Party hardly existed in the region. In 1935 it only fielded\ncandidates in Seaham (Ramsay Macdonald\u2019s seat) and South Shields. In February 1938 Cuthbert Headlam com-\nplained that the Conservative Party could not find any \u2018National Socialists\u2019 [sic.] to support Conservative speakers.\nDRO, D\/HE\/34, Headlam Diary, 25 Feb. 1938.\nPu\nbl\nish\ned\n b\ny \nM\nan\ney\n P\nub\nlis\nhi\nng\n (c\n) U\nniv\ners\nity\n of\n Le\ned\ns\n 299L. H. MATES\npotential Popular Fronters and this appeared almost non-existent in the region. There\nwere no north-east National Government MPs involved in any group of foreign\npolicy critics that centred around Anthony Eden (who resigned from the Cabinet as\nForeign Secretary in February 1938 in protest at Chamberlain\u2019s personal conduct of\ngovernment foreign policy), Winston Churchill, and Harold Macmillan (Conservative\nMP for Stockton). The most rebellious was Samuel Storey (Sunderland), who, along\nwith Macmillan, Churchill and Eden, abstained from voting on the debate on the\nAnglo-Italian agreement in November 1938. He had abstained on foreign policy\nquestions perhaps twice previously in 1938. It is possible that Storey abstained in the\nvote on Labour\u2019s censure motion in the debate surrounding Eden\u2019s resignation.\nColonel Bernard Cruddas (Wansbeck) threatened to rebel on this vote also, but ended\nup actually voting with the government.151 Before and subsequently, Cruddas\nsupported government foreign policy. Both he and Storey loyally supported their\ngovernment in the Commons vote on the government\u2019s handling of the Munich crisis\non 6 October 1938, when a group of government MPs abstained in protest.152 The\nmajority of National Government figures in the region merely voiced loyal support\nfor all facets of their government\u2019s foreign policy throughout all the government\u2019s\nvicissitudes. Indeed, several north-east government supporters, most notably Alfred\nDenville MP (Conservative, Newcastle Central), Sir Nicholas Grattan-Doyle (Conser-\nvative, Newcastle North), Tom Magnay MP (National Liberal, Gateshead) Sir Rob-\nert Aske MP (National Liberal, Newcastle East), and the Marquess of Londonderry\nand his wife displayed varying degrees of sympathy towards Nazi Germany, Fascist\nItaly, and Franco\u2019s Spain.153\nOf course, politicians\u2019 public pronouncements are likely to have differed consider-\nably from their private thoughts. Fortunately, Cuthbert Headlam, one of the most\nimportant and influential north-east Conservatives, left a diary. Headlam moved from\nalmost a pro-fascist stance in 1936 to anti-Nazism soon after (though he remained\na Franco supporter). Yet he did not adopt a critique of government foreign policy.\nInstead, he blamed all Chamberlain\u2019s predecessors for the problems Britain faced,\nincluding during and after the Munich settlement, which he did not like.154 Indeed,\nHeadlam was one of very few Conservatives, and unique in the North-East, explicitly\nto condemn the Popular Front. In March 1939 he told Alnwick Conservatives that\nthe Popular Front \u2018had ruined France for the time being and had brought disaster\n151 Storey\u2019s name did not appear as having voted on the Eden motion, although it is possible he was paired. There\nis no way of being sure: the Times often carried lists of the names of paired MPs, but it did not do so for this vote.\nMoreover, his name was not mentioned in a regional newspaper report on possible north-east Conservative rebels.\nIn mid-March 1938, Storey announced his intention to protest by abstaining from voting for government moves to\norganize talks with Italy, although he \u2018only wanted to be proved wrong\u2019.

It failed to secure significant support from any section of the labour\nmovement in an important region. Extensive support for Cripps in a moderate domi-\nnated Labour region such as the North-East would have suggested that his campaign\ncould have been more successful. This support simply did not materialize. The major-\nity of labour movement moderates in the region permitted the left and their few sup-\nporters to conduct their Popular Front campaigns and then comprehensively defeated\nthem in votes on the issue in every constituency Labour Party except one. Strong\ndisquiet at the national leadership\u2019s stance, particularly its lack of action on Spain,\ndid not translate into substantial support for the Popular Front. A handful of north-\neast Labour politicians may have briefly supported a Popular Front at the time of\nMunich, but if they did their support was very short-lived.158 It was clear that, apart\nfrom the small Communist influenced Labour left, most in the North-East saw their\nlabour movement as sufficient in itself to rectify the situation, if only the leadership\nwould take a firmer lead and discuss tactics with the membership. Even the\nleadership\u2019s refusal to do this did not spawn great support for the Popular Front.\nAlliances to the left and right brought more problems than they solved, and there was\nplenty of room for any Popular Front supporter within the Labour Party. Indeed, the\nLabour Party was already a kind of \u2018Popular Front\u2019, and infinitely preferable to an\nalliance with a declining political force (liberalism) that could not be trusted to deliver\nits supporters\u2019 votes. The United Peace Alliance failed in the region for these reasons\nin 1938. Cripps\u2019s campaign came at a less propitious time and, despite his energy and\nresources, Cripps failed even to muster the numbers that had been mobilized in the\nprevious year. This failure was not due to Cripps\u2019s personality, the niceties of his\nprogramme, or his ill-conceived tactics. The North-East retained its traditional loyalty\nto the Labour leadership and remained convinced that salvation lay in the electoral\nvictory of a diverse, un-regimented and independent labour movement.159 The\n155 Newcastle Journal, 3 Mar. 1939.\n156 Crowson, Facing Fascism, pp. 20\u201321.\n157 Mates, LHR, 69:1 (2004), 323\u201345.\n158 Mates, thesis, pp. 170\u201375.\n159 In general, the north\u2013east labour movement tolerated its rebels. Trevelyan was the only figure of national stand-\ning to be expelled in the region for supporting Cripps. Only Bishop Auckland constituency Labour Party expelled\nlocal activists. This was Hugh Dalton\u2019s seat, a key opponent of Cripps on the NEC. Lesser ranking politicians such\nas Wilkes and Blenkinsop were allowed their rebellion without suffering serious consequences. It is debatable\nwhether they would have been expelled had their profile been higher. Lawther and Watson were permitted to con-\ntinue supporting Cripps without reprimand from DMA council. Like the United Peace Alliance the year before\nresolutions on the topic were not allowed to appear at DMA council meetings, thereby minimizing division. The\nsame tolerance also ensured that divisions within the regional movement over Catholic attitudes to Labour policies\non the Spanish Civil War were minimized.

MATES\nregional labour movement, an influential component of the national movement, was\nsimply not interested in the Popular Front.\nVehemently opposed to both communism and socialism, and prepared to ally either\npermanently at parliamentary level or simply at local electoral level with fellow\ncapitalists, it is hardly surprising that the very small \u2018independent\u2019 Liberal forces in\nthe North-East did not provide any noticeable support for the Popular Front. The\nLiberal Party leader, Archibald Sinclair, feared that a Popular Front alliance with\nLabour would mean the loss of many members on the right of the party. A Popular\nFront agreement at national level would surely have completely ended the small inde-\npendent Liberal presence in the region. North-east Conservatives largely supported\ntheir government\u2019s foreign policy or rebelled at only aspects of it. This rebellion never\nled them into firm contact with Popular Fronters on the left. Figures like Headlam\nshowed that considerable disquiet could exist amongst government supporters at its\nforeign policy, but that the perceived origins of present difficulties in no way led inevi-\ntably to an anti-government alliance. In spite of his wealth and undoubted oratorical\nability, Cripps was never likely to convince a significant section of the north-east\nlabour movement of the need for a Popular Front. Even if he had, there would have\nbeen very few to the right of Labour keen to join forces in the region.\n"}
