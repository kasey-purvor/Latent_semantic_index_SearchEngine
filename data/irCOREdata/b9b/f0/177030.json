We expect that effects of the messages on prescribing behaviour will be mediated\nthrough changes in physicians' cognitions.\nTrial registration number: Current controlled trial ISRCTN72772651\nBackground\nIn the clinical and health services, the problem of a\nknowledge-practice gap and its significant adverse effects\non health and social welfare is increasingly being recog-\nnised and addressed [1,2]. However the effectiveness of\ninterventions to translate knowledge into practice appears\nto vary across different clinical problems, contexts and\norganizations [3]. Current quantitative evaluations of pro-\nfessional behaviour-change strategies provide little insight\ninto how interventions lead to behaviour change, and\nhow they are moderated by different barriers and enablers\nto implementing evidence-based care [4]. This limits the\nability to generalise from the findings of individual stud-\nies to other clinical problems and contexts. One of the\nchallenges for implementation researchers is to develop\ngeneral principles that could produce testable hypotheses\nabout professional behaviour change that apply across a\nrange of clinical contexts, thus leading to greater general-\nisability of research findings. Such principles may be pro-\nvided by systematically developed and rigorously tested\ntheories. The opportunity has arisen to test some of these\ntheoretical principles in the context of the Ontario Printed\nEducational Materials (OPEM) Trial. The content of edu-\ncational messages in this sub-trial will be constructed\nusing both standard methods and methods inspired by\ntheory.\nThe Ontario Printed Educational Materials (OPEM) Trial\nThe OPEM trial [5] was originally designed to be a large,\nsimple two (short, directive message or not) by two (long,\ndiscursive message or not) factorial cluster randomised\ntrial, with participants randomised to one of four groups\n(control, short directive messages only, long discursive\nmessages only, and both short and long messages). The\nmessages are embedded in the informed newsletter, a free\nquarterly publication produced in Canada by ICES. The\nnewsletter is a well-regarded evidence-based practice syn-\nopsis mailed quarterly since 1994 to 9,825 subscribers in\nOntario, including all primary care physicians (except\napproximately 20 who opted to be removed from the\nmailing list). The short directive educational messages are\nproduced on a postcard-sized card stapled to the outside\nof informed. The long educational messages are produced\nas a one-page, two-sided insert into informed (indistin-\nguishable from the rest of the periodical in size, style and\nediting), excluding the directive statements and including\nmore background, an evidence-based guideline, and refer-\nences. OPEM involves three replicated randomised trials\nin three successive editions of informed for three clinical\nbehaviours (assertive hypertension and cholesterol treat-\nment in diabetic patients; regular diabetic retinopathy\nscreening; and use of thiazide diuretics in the initial man-\nagement of hypertension). The TRY-ME study is designed\nto investigate the effects of theory-inspired and standard-\nconstruction short messages in the third replicate of these\ntrials (use of thiazide diuretics in the initial management\nof hypertension). Routinely collected administrative data\n(OHIP, ODB and CIHI data) available within ICES will be\nused to measure changes in prescribing behaviour.\nGuidelines for the initial treatment of hypertension (HT)\namong the elderly population originally recommended\ndiuretics followed by beta-blockers as first line agents [6].\nBeta-blockers are inferior in reducing long-term cardio-\nvascular morbidity and mortality in elderly patients [7],\nwhile calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors\nappeared particularly useful in this group [8-10]. New\nguidelines repositioned diuretics as first-line agents, with\ncalcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors as second-\nline treatments for elderly patients with uncomplicated\nHT [11]. The recent publication of ALLHAT, a multi-centre\nrandomized, double-blind clinical trial, has supported\nthis choice by demonstrating that thiazide diuretics are\nsuperior to other antihypertensive agents in reducing car-\ndiovascular disease outcomes [12].\nIn a separately funded, theory-based process evaluation\nstudy alongside these trials [13], we have developed the-\nory-based questionnaire measures, to be administered\npre- and post-intervention. The aim of the process study is\nto test for potential mediators of behaviour change so that\nmechanisms underlying trial effects can be identified. The\nOPEM process evaluation for the third trial (concerning\nthiazide prescription) will be used to address the second\nresearch question of the TRY-ME study.\nImplementation Science 2007, 2:39 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/2\/1\/39\nPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe dissemination of printed educational materials (for\nexample, mailing summaries of research findings to\nhealth care professionals) is a knowledge translation strat-\negy commonly used in healthcare. There have been few\nevaluations of the effectiveness of this strategy [14,15],\nand little examination of the effect of message content on\nmessage effectiveness. Perhaps this arises from a lack of\nprinciples, categories, or dimensions by which to describe\nmessages (see above). The proposed research offers one\nway of constructing and describing messages about evi-\ndence-based practice that is both testable and replicable.\nTheory-inspired messages\nThere are at least two plausible strategies for selecting a\ntheoretical basis for this study. One is to choose from the\nwell-researched principles relating to the effects of persua-\nsive messages on attitude change, developed at Yale Uni-\nversity in the 1950s [16]. Another is to select from theories\nthat purport to predict actual behaviour.\nTheories of persuasion propose that certain specified fea-\ntures of communication will be more persuasive (i.e., will\nmore likely change attitudes) [17]. For example, one fea-\nture is credibility of the message source. When an audi-\nence perceives that the originator of the message is more\ncredible (e.g., in this context, a scientist rather than a foot-\nball player), the message will be more effective. The\ndesign of the OPEM trial already includes this principle, as\nthe credibility of the informed newsletter is high (see\nabove). Furthermore, the ICES and informed logos appear\non the cards that present the short message, thus presum-\nably enhancing credibility.\nA further principle of persuasion theory, articulated in the\nElaboration Likelihood model of persuasion [18-20], is\nthe distinction between 'central' and 'peripheral' routes to\npersuasion. Individuals are more likely to be persuaded by\nan argument if they are able (i.e., motivated, have the\nskills and opportunity) to use the central route. This\ninvolves processing information deeply (e.g., by consider-\ning the arguments and carefully weighing up the positive\nand negative components). It is thus effective to present\ndetailed information about the issue in question and\ninclude both sides of an argument. Individuals may still\nbe persuaded if they are unable to engage in deep process-\ning, but they will be influenced by factors that have noth-\ning to do with the actual message content. In this\nperipheral route to persuasion, influence may occur\nthrough superficial cues such as the authority or attractive-\nness of the message source, or the amount of repetition of\nthe message, a principle that drives strategies in the adver-\ntising industry. According to the Elaboration Likelihood\nmodel, the persuasive effect of a message that is processed\nthrough the peripheral route is weaker and more tempo-\nrary than through the central route. On the reasonable\nassumption that primary care physicians are both capable\nand motivated to practice evidence-based care, the long\nmessage in the OPEM trial addresses this principle by pre-\nsenting an elaborate message that can be processed using\nthe central route. However, deep processing of informa-\ntion takes time and is a further demand on physicians,\nwhose work is usually time-pressured and demanding.\nHence the 'short message' arm of the OPEM trial attempts\nto provide relevant information formatted attractively\nwith as little demand as possible on time and information\nprocessing resources. One highly generalisable aspect of\nthe OPEM trial will relate to the three replications of the\nquestion of long versus short messages.\nIn summary, some aspects of persuasion theory are\nalready represented in the OPEM trial. The theory-based\nprocess evaluation study, being conducted alongside the\ntrial, includes a test of the predictions from this theory;\nnamely, that exposure to the educational messages will\nchange attitudes. Within this framework, the idea that\naltered attitudes will result in altered clinical actions is\nmerely an assumption, albeit a plausible one, as persua-\nsion theory is silent with respect to the effect of attitudes\non behaviour.\nA number of theories propose a measurable link between\nattitudes and behaviour. This link has been empirically\ntested and appears to be robust. The TPB (Figure 1) is one\nsuch theory [21]. According to the TPB, the immediate\nprecursor of behaviour is intention. To predict whether a\nperson intends to do something, we need to know the per-\nson's attitude (i.e., whether the person is in favour of\ndoing it). In addition, prediction will be improved by\nmeasuring two more variables: how much the person feels\nsocial pressure to do it ('subjective norm') and whether\nthe person feels in control of the action in question ('per-\nceived behavioural control'). Changing these three 'pre-\ndictors' will increase the chance that the person will\nintend to do a desired action, and thus increase the chance\nof the person actually doing it. In a clinical consultation,\nthe clinician's treatment decisions and actions are exam-\nples of intentional behaviour.\nThe TPB has been extensively tested in clinical settings,\nand includes guidance about how best to operationalise\nthe constructs [22-24]. For example, the behaviour must\nbe specified carefully in terms of the action itself (e.g., pre-\nscribing), its target (e.g., thiazide diuretics), the context\n(e.g., patients with hypertension) and the time (e.g., soon\nafter diagnosis; in the near future). This is known as the\nTACT principle. The TRY-ME study will utilise the TPB\nbecause (a) it is well-tested in the clinical domain; and (b)\nspecifications about operationalising the key variables are\nwell developed [25-27].\nImplementation Science 2007, 2:39 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/2\/1\/39\nPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nThe primary research question is whether a message\ninspired by the TPB will be more effective in changing\nclinical behaviour towards more evidence-based practice\nthan a message based on 'standard' methods that are less\ninformed by an explicit theoretical model. In addition\n(and as an indicator of underlying processes), we hypoth-\nesize that the variables in the theory that are represented\nin the theory-inspired message will be measurably\nimproved among physicians who are exposed to theory-\ninspired message (compared with the standard message\ngroup and the control group), whereas the variables in the\ntheory that are not represented in the theory-inspired\nmessage will not show such improvement.\nFor the TRY-ME study, the group randomised to receive\nthe short directive message attached to the outside of the\ninformed newsletter (the 'outsert') will be sub-randomised\nto receive either a standard message or a message\ninformed by the TPB. The trial design will thus be\nexpanded to a two (long message \u2013 'insert' \u2013 or no insert)\nby three (theory-based outsert; standard outsert; or no\noutsert) design (see Table 1). The messages will relate to\nprescription of thiazide diuretics as first line drug treat-\nment for hypertension (described in the accompanying\nprotocol, 'The Ontario Printed Educational Materials\ntrial') [5]. The short messages will be developed inde-\npendently by two research teams, and the validity of the\ndistinction between theory-inspired and standard mes-\nsages will be established empirically.\nThe primary outcome is prescription of thiazide diuretics,\nmeasured by routinely collected data available within\nTheory of Planned Behaviour \u2013 Ajzen, 1991Figu e 1\nTheory of Planned Behaviour \u2013 Ajzen, 1991.\nBehavioural\nBeliefs\nAttitude\nToward the\nBehaviour\nNormative\nBeliefs\nSubjective\nNorm\nPerceived\nbehavioural\ncontrol\nControl\nBeliefs\nIntention Behaviour \nTable 1: Design of replicate three of the OPEM Trial (the TRY-ME study)\nOPEM REPLICATE 3: \nPrescribing diuretics for first-\nline treatment of \nhypertension\nLONG INSERT NO INSERT\nSHORT OUTSERT Theory-based outsert 1.

The study is designed to answer the question, is\nthere any difference in guideline adherence (i.e., thiazide\nprescription rates) between physicians in these 6 groups?\nAims and objectives\nThe aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a theory-\ninspired short message compared with a 'standard' short\nmessage (without an explicit theoretical basis) and a long,\ndiscursive message in changing prescribing behaviour.\nThe objectives are:\n1. To develop two brief educational messages recom-\nmending the use of thiazide diuretics for the first line drug\ntreatment of hypertension: one inspired by theory and\none 'standard' (Phase I).\n2. To test the effect of type of message (the two short mes-\nsages and the long message) on frequency of prescription\nof thiazide diuretics using the two by three design\ndescribed above. (Phase II). Prescribing behaviour will be\nmeasured two months before and six months after the\nintervention.\n3. To use the theory-based process evaluation study to test\nthe effects of these three messages in terms of the variables\nrepresented in the TPB (Phase III).\n4. To test an explanatory proposition: that intervention\neffects will be mediated by changes in attitudes, subjective\nnorms and intentions (Phase IV).\nMethods\nEthics approval\nThe TRY-ME project has received ethics approval from the\nResearch Ethics Board, Sunnybrook Campus, University\nof Toronto (Project identification number 135-2004).\nStudy participants and setting\nParticipants are the primary care physicians in Ontario\nwho receive the informed newsletter (and are thus partici-\npants in the third replicate of the OPEM trial) [5]. Data\nfrom this sample will be used to test the first hypothesis\n(specified in study objective two).\nThe subsample of these participants who will receive the\nTPB questionnaire will form the sample for the process\nstudy (relating to study objectives three and four). The\nquestionnaire will be sent to 504 physicians randomly\nselected from the trial sample by the ICES-based investiga-\ntors. The survey will be mailed to this subsample two\nmonths before and six months after the dissemination of\nthe index edition of informed.\nDevelopment of intervention materials\nTwo research teams will independently develop the word-\ning of the two short messages. One team will consist of\npsychologists with experience in implementation research\nand clinical researchers experienced in the use of psycho-\nlogical theories (who will develop the theory-inspired\nmessage); the other team will consist of clinical research-\ners experienced implementation research and in the devel-\nopment of short educational messages directed to\nclinicians (who will develop the standard message). Each\nmessage will be designed to include the following:\n\u2022 Banner\n\u2022 Up to four bullet points\n\u2022 Up to 85 words\n\u2022 Key clinical messages with footnotes on back of card\n\u2022 Cite the ALLHAT trial as the evidence base for the recom-\nmended behaviour\nFollowing agreement on message wording, a graphic\ndesign consultant will format the messages using similar\nstyles, font sizes and colours.\nTesting the validity of the intended distinction between \ntheory-inspired and standard messages\nThe Aberdeen Health Psychology group, approximately\n15 doctoral fellows, post-doctoral fellows and academics\nat the University of Aberdeen, who are not familiar with\nthe OPEM study or with the way the two messages have\nbeen constructed, will be given the two messages and\nasked to make the following judgements with respect to\neach:\n\u2022 What is the target behaviour?\n\u2022 How clearly does the message specify the behaviour?\n\u2022 Which theoretical constructs are reflected in this mes-\nsage?\nResponse formats will include confidence or extent ratings\nto produce continuous scales for appropriate analysis of\nthe data. Order of presentation of the two messages will\nbe counter-balanced, so that half the group will be pre-\nsented with the theory-inspired message first.\nPaired sample t-tests will be used to test differences\nbetween judgements. Validity check materials are pre-\nsented in Additional file 1. The results will provide evi-\ndence regarding whether the 'theory-inspired' message has\na greater amount of theoretical content (including the\nImplementation Science 2007, 2:39 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/2\/1\/39\nPage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nclarity of specification of the target behaviour) than the\nstandard message.\nDevelopment of survey instruments\nThese have been developed in accordance with the OPEM\ntheory-based process evaluation study protocol [13].\nBased on the TPB (Figure 1), a questionnaire will be devel-\noped to assess attitudes to prescription of thiazide diuret-\nics as first line drug treatment of hypertension; perceived\nsocial pressure ('subjective norms') with respect to pre-\nscription of thiazide diuretics as first line drug treatment\nof hypertension; perceived control over this behaviour;\nand intention to prescribe thiazide diuretics as first line\ndrug treatment of hypertension.\nOutcome and process variables\nPrimary outcome\nRoutinely collected data available within ICES will be\nused to measure changes in prescription of thiazide diu-\nretics as the first line drug treatment for people with newly\ndiagnosed hypertension. This will enable us to test for\ngroup differences by comparing the thiazide prescription\nrates of the groups exposed to the theory-inspired short\nmessage, the standard short message and the long\nmessage.\nProcess measures\nThe process evaluation survey instrument based on the\nTPB, to be administered pre- and post-intervention, will\ninclude measures of attitude, subjective norm, perceived\nbehavioural control and intention.\nSample size considerations\nPrimary outcome\nBecause the informed newsletter is mailed to over 9,000\nprimary care physicians, the sample size is adequate to\nboth accommodate a second version of the short message\nand provide adequate numbers to recruit the required\nsubsample for the process evaluation. Please see the\nOPEM trial protocol for additional details [5].\nProcess measures\nAssuming a 50% response rate for each survey (pre- and\npost-intervention), we will mail the survey to 252 physi-\ncians in each of the six groups to achieve the sample size\nneeded to have 80% power of detecting an effect size of\n0.5 standard deviations using a significance level of 5%.\nPlease see the OPEM process evaluation protocol for addi-\ntional details [13].\nPlanned analyses\nFirst, we will compare groups using methods appropriate\nfor comparing independent samples (t-tests to compare\ntwo groups; analysis of covariance to compare groups\nadjusting for differences in baseline performance) to\ndetermine whether there have been changes in the pre-\nscription of thiazide diuretics across the study groups as\nhypothesised.\nSecond, in line with the protocol for the theory-based\nprocess evaluation study related to OPEM, we will test\ninternal reliability of the questionnaire measures using\nCronbach's alpha. If internal consistency is <0.7, we will\nexplore whether we can improve this by omitting any\nindividual item. We will then use a two-way Analysis of\nCovariance to test for group differences in scores for atti-\ntudes, subjective norms and intentions.\nTo test the mediation hypothesis, we will use a series of\nregression analyses (in the manner described by Baron\nand Kenny [28]) to explore the relationships between pre-\ndictor variables (attitude and subjective norm), mediator\n(intention) and the dependent variable (recorded behav-\niour). If the dependent variable is markedly skewed, we\nwill use generalized linear modelling regression to allow\nfor this.\nDiscussion\nThe benefits of theory-based interventions have been\nargued elsewhere [29]. Briefly, results of intervention\nstudies that have a strong theoretical basis are potentially\nmore generalisable than their atheoretical counterparts \u2013\nor at least the limits of generalisability can be more easily\nspecified. As theories identify process variables (in this\ncase, the constructs that are proposed to mediate behav-\niour change), and how to operationalise them, the proc-\nesses underlying change can be made explicit and\ninvestigated appropriately. This approach is thus likely to\nresult in a cumulative science of implementation of evi-\ndence-based health care. In addition, the TRY-ME study\nenables us to distinguish between the content of an inter-\nvention and its mode of delivery. The same information\n(content) can be delivered using a variety of modes (e.g.,\neducational group sessions; opinion leaders; printed\nmaterials), so holding the mode of delivery constant, as\nwe have done in this study, enables us to investigate the\nquestion of content without contamination from the\npotential effects of different modes of delivery. Hence,\nthis study will add to the body of knowledge that distin-\nguishes between content and delivery mode.\nFurthermore, an educational message is essentially a com-\nplex intervention. Theorizing of the intervention content\nalso allows us to distinguish between intervention com-\nponents (e.g., aspects of a message that focus on attitudes\nversus aspects that focus on subjective norms). By evaluat-\ning the effect of the intervention on each process variable,\nwe can potentially identify which components are the\nactive ingredients of the intervention. This work can thus\nImplementation Science 2007, 2:39 http:\/\/www.implementationscience.com\/content\/2\/1\/39\nPage 7 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlead to further studies that make explicit predictions\nabout the effects of intervention components.\nThere are, however, limitations to this study that are dic-\ntated by pragmatic issues. For example, in experimental\ncognitive psychology, two sets of stimuli presented in a\nstudy like this would be exactly matched for word length\nand word frequency (i.e., how often each word is encoun-\ntered in the daily use of a language, a proxy measure of\nword familiarity). Although the TRY-ME materials will be\ndevised using a common set of criteria (see above), we\nwill be subject to permissions and opinions of the editors\nof informed and this may limit our capacity to render the\ntwo versions of the insert comparable in this strict sense.\nFurthermore, as argued above, the 'standard' method of\ndeveloping the short message is not entirely devoid of the-\nory; the underlying theory is merely less explicit for the\nstandard message than for the theory-based message. The\nvalidation procedure for distinguishing between theory-\nbased and standard messages will provide quantification\nof this possibility and is potentially a useful methodolog-\nical component of this work.\nIn conclusion, the TRY-ME study will use theories and\nmethods from psychology to devise a brief educational\nmessage in an attempt to change the behaviour of family\nphysicians. We predict that the three kinds of messages\n(long; short and devised using standard methods; short\nand theory-based) will have different effects on behaviour\nchange.\nList of abbreviations\nCIHI \u2013 Canadian Institute for Health Information\nICES \u2013 Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences\nODB \u2013 Ontario Drug Benefit Program\nOHIP \u2013 Ontario Health Insurance Plan\nOPEM \u2013 Ontario Printed Educational Material\nPEM \u2013 Printed Educational Material\nTACT \u2013 Target, Action, Context, Time\nTPB \u2013 Theory of Planned Behaviour\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJF contributed to the development of the theory-based\nmessage, designed the validation test for the theory-based\nversus non-theory-based messages, was a Co-I for the\nprocess evaluation study, and drafted the manuscript.
