Special \ncirculations have additional specific features of blood flow control. Several \norgans control their blood supply by autoregulation. Coronary blood flow is \nlinked to myocardial oxygen consumption, primarily by a metabolic mechanism, \nthus increases in demand, or decreases in supply, of oxygen cause the release of \nvasodilator metabolites, which act on vascular smooth muscle to cause relaxation \nand hence increase blood flow.  Cerebral blood flow is primarily regulated by a \nmyogenic mechanism whereby increases in transmural pressure stretch the \nsmooth muscle, which responds by contracting, however, this can be overridden \nby cerebral tissue PCO2. Further, the cerebral circulation is contained in a rigid \nstructure (the skull) that has additional consequences for blood flow after brain \ninjury, when the pressure within this compartment may rise dramatically.  Renal \nblood flow is regulated by both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms; sympathetic \nvasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles reduces renal blood flow in response to \na decrease in effective circulating volume, myogenic mechanisms and \ntubuloglomerular feedback, as well as the release of vasoactive metabolites from \nthe vascular endothelium regulate renal blood flow intrinsically. Hepatic blood \nflow is delivered via the hepatic artery and the portal vein, and the amount \nvaries reciprocally to maintain total blood flow constant. The pulmonary \ncirculation receives the entire cardiac output and blood flow is regulated both \npassively and actively. Pulmonary vessels are highly distensible and can \naccommodate increases in blood flow without significant increases in pressure. \nHowever, this leads to regional differences in blood flow throughout the lung. \nRegional reductions in alveolar oxygen tension constrict local arterioles to divert \nblood to better ventilated areas. \n \n \n \nIn \u2018special circulations\u2019 additional factors govern the control of blood flow, beyond \nthe \u2018standard\u2019 mechanisms that prevail in most organ systems (see article Control of \nthe Circulation).  In this article the coronary, cerebral, renal, hepatic and pulmonary \n\u2018special\u2019 circulations are considered. \n \nBlood flow through the cardiovascular system is dependant on the force driving blood \nalong the vessel (pressure gradient) and is restricted by the resistance of the vessels.  \nThe resistance to blood flow, in turn is dependent on the radius and length of the \nblood vessel and the viscosity of the blood flowing through it.  In practice it is the \nresistance of the arterioles that normally has the greatest effect on blood flow.  An \napproximate relationship between vessel dimensions and blood viscosity is shown in \nEquation 1 (below). \n \nPoiseuille\u2019s law is an approximation for the cardiovascular system since Poiseuille\u2019s \nlaw strictly should only be applied to Newtonian fluids flowing through a straight \nunbranched, non-distensible, tube; conditions that do not prevail in the cardiovascular \nsystem.  However, the equation does give a useful approximation for the \ncardiovascular system. \n \nQ = \uf070(P1 \u2013 P2) r4 \n             8\uf068l \n \nPoiseuille\u2019s law; Q = blood flow, P1 \u2013 P2 = the pressure gradient (normally arterial \nminus venous), r = radius of the vessel, \uf068 \uf03d viscosity, l = length of the vessel, \uf070\/8 = \nconstant of proportionality. \n \nIn Poiseuille\u2019s Law radius of the vessel is raised to the power 4, thus if the radius \nwere to double, flow would increase 16-fold. The most important vessels regulating \nblood flow in this manner are the small arteries and arterioles as they contain an \nabundance of vascular smooth muscle arranged in a circular manner along the length \nof the vessel, the tone of which is regulated by both extrinsic (neural and humoral) \nand intrinsic (myogenic and metabolic) factors.   \n \nExtrinsic control \n \nThe major vasomotor nerves are vasoconstrictor sympathetic fibres, which have tonic \nactivity, accounting for the basal tone in resistance vessels. The primary \nneurotransmitter released from sympathetic nerve terminals is noradrenaline (NA) \nacting on the \u03b1 and \u03b2-adrenoreceptors. In many vascular beds the sympathetic system \nis associated with activation of \u03b1-adrenceptors to mediate a vasoconstriction.  Only a \nsmall proportion of the resistance vessels in the body receive a parasympathetic \n(vasodilator) nerve supply, e.g., the cerebral and meningeal blood vessels, parts of the \nviscera, genitalia, large bowel and bladder, but not skeletal muscle or skin. The \nvasodilation of cutaneous blood vessels in association with sweating may be partly \ndue to the production of a vasodilator polypeptide bradykinin within exocrine glands.  \n \nAdrenaline has varying effects on vessel diameter, and hence blood flow; in skeletal \nmuscle low concentrations of adrenaline act on the \u03b2-adrenoreceptors to induce \nvasodilation, whereas in high concentrations acts on the \u03b1-adrenoreceptors to induce \nvasoconstriction. NA, however, is always a vasoconstrictor. Other vasoconstrictor \nhormones include angiotensin II and vasopressin. \n \nIntrinsic control  \n \nIntrinsic control refers to local control within a vascular bed rather than a centrally-\nmediated reflex control.  Local control of the circulation can be divided into direct \neffects on vascular smooth muscle and indirect effects via the vascular endothelium.  \n \nProperties of vascular smooth muscle  \nA number of vascular beds can maintain a constant blood flow despite variations in \narterial blood pressure (within limits).  This is termed autoregulation. In addition, \nmany organs adjust blood flow to match metabolic activity. This type of local \nregulation occurs independently of both the endothelium and nervous input, and is the \nresult of direct changes in vascular tone. There are currently two main theories to \nexplain autoregulation of blood flow: \n \nMyogenic mechanism \nIncreased tension in the blood vessel wall stretches the vascular sarcolemma. The \nvascular muscle responds by contracting, and increasing resistance to maintain \npressure, and hence blood flow, constant.  \n \nMetabolic mechanism \nIn certain organs blood flow is regulated to match metabolic activity of the tissue. A \ndecrease in supply or an increase in demand of oxygen causes the tissue to release \nvasodilator metabolites such as; \n\u2022 potassium ions \n\u2022 hydrogen ions (lactic acid)  \n\u2022 phosphate ions  \n\u2022 carbon dioxide  \n\u2022 prostaglandins  \n\u2022 adenosine  \nThese act locally, directly influencing vascular smooth muscle to cause relaxation \nand an increase in blood flow. This is called functional hyperaemia.  A decrease in \nmetabolic activity will decrease the formation of vasodilator metabolites, and hence \nlead to vasoconstriction.  There is normally a background level of metabolites in the \ntissue so this mechanism can also form the basis of autoregulation.  An increase in \nblood pressure can increase blood flow (Equation 1).  This will cause a \u2018wash-out\u2019 of \nvasodilator metabolites leading to a loss of vasodilator influence and hence a \nvasoconstriction, reducing blood flow back to the original level. \n \nProperties of the endothelium  \nThe vascular endothelium can also influence local blood flow. Endothelial cells \nproduce and release both vasodilator and vasoconstrictor metabolites in response to a \nvariety of stimuli such as shear stress due to increased blood flow and hypoxia. Nitric \noxide (NO) is perhaps the most important of the vasodilator substances (see \nAnaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine 2:2: 77). \n \nThe relative importance of these different regulatory mechanisms of regional blood \nflow differs between different vascular beds and at different times within the same \nvascular bed. \n \nCoronary circulation \n \nThe myocardium receives its entire nutritional blood supply from the coronary \narteries. The right coronary artery mainly supplies the right atrium and ventricle, the \nleft coronary artery divides into the anterior descending and circumflex branches and \nmainly supplies the left atrium and ventricle.  \n \nControl of myocardial blood flow \nThe primary factor responsible for perfusion of the myocardium is aortic pressure. \nHowver, moment-to-moment coronary blood flow (CBF) is strongly influenced by \nmechanical activity of the heart. The coronary blood vessels course through the \nmyocardium and are thus compressed during systole. Thus, CBF is greatest during \nearly diastole when extravascular compression is minimal and aortic pressure is still \nhigh, and lowest during isovolumetric contraction when extravascular compression \ncan interrupt, or even reverse blood flow in the left ventricular coronary vessels \n(Figure 1). Tachycardia (reduced diastolic time), elevations in end-diastolic pressure, \nand reduced arterial pressure will all result in a reduction in CBF. Compression of the \ncoronary arteries is greatest near the endocardial surface and diminishes nearer the \nepicardial surface. Thus, it is vessels in the left ventricular inner wall which are most \nsusceptible to ischaemic damage in coronary artery disease.  \n \nCBF is tightly linked to myocardial oxygen consumption, primarily by the metabolic \nmechanism. In contrast to most tissues, cardiac tissue extracts oxygen maximally even \nunder normal conditions.  The heart therefore adjusts its blood flow to meet its \nmetabolic needs. Adenosine appears to play a significant role in metabolic \nvasodilation under pathophysiological conditions such as ischaemia, but may not be \ninvolved in matching CBF to myocardial metabolism under physiological conditions \nsuch as exercise (1). Numerous other agents may be involved in functional \nhyperaemia (hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, potassium and hydrogen ions) but the full \nmechanism is yet to be determined.  \n \nCardiac nerve activity has little influence on CBF. Activation of cardiac sympathetic \nnerve fibres initially constricts, and vagal nerve activity initially slightly relaxes the \ncoronary resistance vessels. However, the resulting changes in metabolic work have a \nfar more potent effect on vascular tone.  \n \nCerebral circulation \n \nBlood flow to the brain is via the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, which \nanastomose to form the circle of Willis. The brain is particularly intolerant of periods \nof ischaemia. Indeed, interruption of cerebral blood flow for as little as 5 seconds \nresults in loss of consciousness, and irreversible cell damage occurs within minutes. \nCerebral blood flow will be maintained at the expense of other organs in situations of \nreduced cardiac output, such as haemorrhage.  \n \nThe whole of the cerebral circulation lies within a rigid structure, the cranium, the \ncontents of which are essentially incompressible (see Anaesthesia & Intensive Care \nMedicine 2:8: 293). Following head injury cerebral oedema occurs which may lead to \nintracranial hypertension. Under these conditions cerebral perfusion pressure is \ngoverned by the difference between arterial pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP) \nrather than the usual arterio-venous pressure difference.  Increased ICP following \nhead injury will reduce cerebral blood flow and may lead to cerebral ischaemia. \nRecent studies suggest that resuscitation with hypertonic solutions may reduce ICP in \nthese circumstances. \n \nControl of cerebral blood flow \nTotal cerebral blood flow is maintained within tight limits to ensure an uninterrupted \nsupply of oxygen to the brain, although local neuronal activity is associated with \nchanges in regional cerebral blood flow via metabolic substances. Extrinsic control of \ntotal cerebral blood flow appears to be weak and mainly affects larger cerebral vessels, \nwhereas the cerebral resistance vessels are regulated under a well-developed intrinsic \nmechanism. Autoregulation of total cerebral blood flow is apparent within the range \nof 60-180 mmHg arterial pressure, and this is likely to be due to a myogenic \nmechanism, but this range may be right-shifted by sympathetic nerve activity or \nchronic systemic hypertension. Cerebral myogenic autoregulation can be overridden \nby changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension; even small degrees of hypercapnia \ncause vasodilation and hypocapnia leads to vasoconstriction. Hypoxaemia also causes \ncerebral vasodilation at thresholds which may be as high as 8.5kPa. The vasodilatory \neffects of hypercapnia but not hypoxaemia, appear to be mediated by NO from the \nendothelium (see Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine 2:2: 77).  \n \nRenal circulation \n \nBlood flow to the kidneys is via the renal arteries, which eventually branch to form \nthe afferent arterioles, glomerular capillaries and efferent arterioles. This arrangement \naids tight regulation of renal blood flow (RBF) and, indirectly, glomerular filtration \n(GFR).  \n \nControl of renal blood flow \nRBF is regulated by both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms. Autoregulation of RBF \noccurs over the range of pressures 90-180 mmHg by two mechanisms; the myogenic \nmechanism and tubuloglomerular feedback, whereby changes in tubular flow rate are \ndetected by the cells of the macula densa, which in turn leads to changes in afferent \narteriolar diameter, to alter glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure and hence \ncontrol GFR. It has been suggested that the variable sensed is NaCl concentration of \ntubular fluid and the likely effector mediators are adenosine, (which, in this instance \nconstricts the afferent arteriole) and NO. Stimulation of renal sympathetic nerves \ncause an \u03b1-adrenoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction of both afferent and efferent \narterioles, but primarily affects afferent arterioles; e.g., sympathetic vasoconstriction \nof the afferent arterioles occurs in response to strong emotional stimuli and decreases \nin effective circulating volume to decrease RBF. Endothelial cells also play an \nimportant role in regulating in RBF (Figure 2).  \n \nHepatic circulation \n \nThe liver receives three quarters of its blood supply from the portal vein (PV; formed \nfrom the superior mesenteric and splenic vein) and the rest from the hepatic artery \n(HA; a branch of the coeliac trunk). As the PV has already passed through the spleen \nand gastrointestinal circulation oxygen saturation is low. However, blood in the HA is \nfully saturated. The PV and HA branch to form the terminal portal venules and \nhepatic arterioles, both of which contain vascular smooth muscle, and drain into the \nsinusoids (capillary network) in the acinus.  \n \nControl of hepatic blood flow \nBlood flow in the PV and HA varies reciprocally in an attempt to maintain hepatic \nblood flow. However, the increase in blood flow in one vessel doesn\u2019t fully \ncompensate for reductions in the other. The hepatic arterial buffer response (HABR) \nnormally maintains blood flow and hence oxygen delivery constant to the liver at \ntimes of reduced portal venous flow and is thought to be mediated by adenosine. Thus \nunder normal conditions adenosine is constantly washed out by portal venous blood \nflow, however, under conditions of decreased portal venous flow adenosine \naccumulates and, due to the close proximity of the PV and HA, leads to dilation of the \nhepatic arterioles and increases in blood flow. \n \nThe PV and HA are innervated by noradrenergic sympathetic nerves, activity in \nwhich reduces blood flow during low flow states such as hypovolaemia. However, \nstimulation of hepatic nerves has a more significant effect on capacitance vessels and \ncan mobilise about half of the hepatic blood volume following haemorrhage. \n \nPulmonary circulation \n \nThe pulmonary circulation is a low resistance (one tenth of systemic), low pressure, \nhigh flow network with a very high density of capillaries. Pulmonary arterioles have \nvery little vascular smooth muscle and so do not have the same capacity for \nvasoconstriction as do systemic arterioles. However, this structure matches its \nfunction in that it is required to accept the entire cardiac output at all times, whilst \nminimising right ventricular work.   \n \nPassive regulation of pulmonary blood flow \nLarge increases in flow (as in exercise) can be accommodated with only small \nincreases in pressure, thus resistance must fall further. This is achieved by recruitment \nand distension of capillaries. Lung volume also has affects on pulmonary vascular \nresistance (PVR); at low and high lung volumes resistance is high, and lowest at \nfunctional residual capacity. The low pressures and high distensibility of the \npulmonary vessels mean that gravity causes regional variations in blood flow within \nthe lung, which is affected by posture and exercise. In the upright individual flow is \ngreatest at the bottom of the lung due to the hydrostatic pressure of the \u2018column\u2019 of \nblood above it. Flow at the apices is thus lowest and in conditions of low pulmonary \narterial pressure such as hypovolaemia, or positive pressure ventilation, intravascular \npressure may fall below extravascular (alveolar) pressure in this region leading to \ncessation of blood flow and reduced gas exchange. \n \nActive regulation of pulmonary blood flow  \nPulmonary arterioles are innervated by the autonomic nervous system and PVR may \nbe altered by stimulation of the baro and chemoreceptor reflexes. However, the main \ninfluence on PVR is hypoxia. Regional reductions in alveolar oxygen tension constrict \nlocal arterioles (opposite to systemic effects) to divert blood to better ventilated areas \nand thus optimise the ventilation:perfusion ratio (Figure 3). However if more than \n20% of the lung is involved this may increase overall PVR and lead to pulmonary \nhypertension and pulmonary oedema.  \n  \n \n \nFigure 1  \nNOTE: FOR THIS FIGURE PLEASE USE A FIGURE PREVIOUSLY \nPUBLISHED IN ANAESTHESIA AND INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE 2:1 \n(feb), pg14 fig 1  \n \n \n \nFigure 2 Role of endothelial cells in renal afferent and efferent arteriolar \nvascular tone \n \nEndothelial cells produce several vasoactive hormones which act on the smooth \nmuscle cells to regulate RBF.
