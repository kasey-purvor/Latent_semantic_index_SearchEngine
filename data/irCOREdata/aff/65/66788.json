INTRODUCTION\nNanowires \u0002NWs\u0003 fabricated in a bottom-up manner1,2 via\nthe vapor-liquid-solid \u0002VLS\u0003 mechanism3 with a metallic\n\u0002Au\u0003 catalyst have recently shown the ability to accumulate\nstrain in two dimensions \u00022D\u0003 and to enable coherent growth\nat sufficiently small footprints.4\u20136 The critical diameter for\ncoherent epitaxial growth of NWs decreases with the lattice\nmismatch \u00030 \u0002Ref. 4\u0003 and equals 24\u201326 nm for InAs\/Si \u0002\u00030\n=11.6%\u0003, 36\u201338 nm for InP\/Si \u0002\u00030=8.1%\u0003, and 110 nm for\nGaAs\/Si \u0002\u00030=4.0%\u0003 systems.5,6 The NW geometry therefore\nlooks very promising for monolithic integration of III-V\ncompounds on silicon. The controlled production of III-V\nNWs \u0002in general, not only on Si substrates\u0003 requires, how-\never, careful considerations of their chemical purity and crys-\ntal structure. Au-assisted VLS growth can lead to an uninten-\ntional Au contamination.7 As regards the crystal-phase purity,\nit is now generally recognized that, in contrast to their bulk\nzincblende \u0002ZB\u0003 form, most of III-V NWs tend to adopt hex-\nagonal wurtzite \u0002WZ\u0003 structure.5,8\u201312 Usually, the WZ phase\nis not stable; the NWs have a disordered polytypelike struc-\nture with mixed WZ-ZB character. Since these stacking\nfaults introduce unwanted defects, the control over the phase\npurity is now considered as one of the major challenges in\nNW fabrication techniques.\nAccording to Ref. 13, the difference in bulk cohesive en-\nergies between the WZ and ZB GaAs phases amounts to 24\nmeV per pair. To overcome this difference and obtain WZ\nGaAs in bulk form, one should apply a huge pressure on the\norder of several tens of gigapascal.14 In the NW geometry,\nthe volume contribution to the overall formation enthalpy\ncan be more than compensated by the surface-energy gain.\nIndeed, WZ NWs feature a lower number of dangling bonds\non relevant sidewall facets and on the edges separating the\nfacets.15\u201317 A kinetic model of NW growth and crystal phase\npioneered in Ref. 18 and further developed in Refs. 19 and\n20 shows the importance of nucleation. During the mono-\nnuclear VLS growth of a NW, the WZ phase is favored if the\nnucleation barrier of 2D WZ island formation is lower than\nof a ZB one. This requires two conditions:18 \u0002i\u0003 the material-\nrelated condition for the surface energies to allow triple\nphase line \u0002TL\u0003 nucleation \u0002where some part of nucleus pe-\nrimeter is in contact with the vapor and the lower surface\nenergy of WZ sidewall facets can decrease the nucleation\nbarrier\u0003 and \u0002ii\u0003 a growth-related condition which makes liq-\nuid supersaturation decisive for the observed crystal struc-\nture. Also, increasing the NW diameter must suppress the TL\nnucleation19 in the polynuclear growth mode and therefore\nrestore the bulk ZB phase.\nWith these considerations, one method for tuning the\ncrystal structure of III-V NWs is changing the deposition\nconditions and Au nanoparticle diameter.21\u201327 For example,\nas demonstrated in Refs. 21 and 22 in the case of Au-assisted\nmolecular beam epitaxy \u0002MBE\u0003 of GaAs NWs on the GaAs\nsubstrates, intelligent manipulations of the growth conditions\npermit continuously low supersaturation in the vicinity of\ngrowing NWs and, consequently, the stacking-fault-free ZB\nstructure. The study in Refs. 23 and 24 indicates that the\nstructure of InAs and InP NWs can be controlled by the\ndiameter and growth temperature. As expected, NWs of\nsmaller diameter are predominantly WZ, with a temperature-\ndependent crossover to the ZB structure for larger diameters.\nIn Ref. 25, the pure ZB phase in different III-V NWs grown\nby Au-catalyzed molecular-organic chemical-vapor deposi-\ntion \u0002MOCVD\u0003 is achieved using a low growth temperature\ncoupled with a high V\/III ratio. The comprehensive analysis\nin Ref. 27 confirms the pure ZB phase \u0002regardless of NW\ndiameter and the substrate material\u0003 only for antimonides. In\nthe MOCVD case, liquid supersaturation during the NW\ngrowth is sensitive to the temperature-dependent pyrolysis\nefficiencies and therefore to the precursors used. This could\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 82, 035302 \u00022010\u0003\n1098-0121\/2010\/82\u00023\u0003\/035302\u00026\u0003 \u00a92010 The American Physical Society035302-1\nbe an explanation of the controversial results of Ref. 5 that\nreport the pure WZ structure for different III-V NWs and\nRef. 27, where GaAs NWs appear to be pure ZB.\nAs regards the crystal structure of III-V NWs grown on Si\nsubstrates, the pure ZB phase has been observed in the case\nof Au-catalyzed MOCVD of GaAs NWs on the Si\u0002111\u0003 sub-\nstrates with AlGaAs buffers.28 In Ref. 29, pure ZB, Ga-\ncatalyzed GaAs NWs \u0002although containing two twin ZB ori-\nentations\u0003 has been obtained by MBE on the GaAs substrates\ncoated with a sputtered silicon dioxide layer. This study dem-\nonstrates the importance of As flux: ZB structure has been\nachieved only under sufficiently high As pressure. Self-\nassembled GaAs NWs of Ref. 30 could nucleate only on the\n\u0002110\u0003 facets. Structural analysis demonstrated two types of\nNWs, the first one being terminated by a Ga droplet and the\nsecond by pyramidal shaped GaAs. The first type of NWs\ncomprises the WZ phase remote from the droplet while the\nsecond type comprise predominantly ZB lattice with rather\nnarrow WZ regions. Catalyst-free InAs NWs,31 grown by\nMOCVD directly on Si\u0002111\u0003 substrates, are mainly ZB, how-\never, high densities of twins and stacking faults are found. In\nRef. 32, epitaxial GaAs NWs were obtained by Au-assisted\nMBE on Si\u0002100\u0003 and Si\u0002111\u0003 substrates but the structural\ncharacterization again revealed mixed ZB\/WZ character.\nIn this work, we present pure ZB NWs \u0002excluding the\nvery tips just beneath the Ga droplet, where stacking faults\nand WZ phase exist\u0003 grown directly on Si\u0002111\u0003 substrate by a\nspecial MBE procedure. As in Ref. 29, the key point is the\nformation of liquid Ga nanoparticles at the initial stage in the\nopenings of a native oxide layer but on the Si\u0002111\u0003 substrate.\nThese Ga droplets act as the catalyst seeds promoting NW\nnucleation via the VLS mechanism at the follow-up growth\nstage. It is demonstrated that the change in catalyst from Au\nto Ga has a tremendous effect on the crystal phase, which is\nfound to be almost single-crystalline ZB. A simple nucleation\nmodel is used to explain the observed phase purity by the\ndecrease in the surface energy of the droplet, which sup-\npresses the formation of WZ islands on surface energetic\ngrounds.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nOur growth procedure and in situ diagnostics are as fol-\nlows: the GaAs NWs are grown by MBE using EP1203\nsetup directly on Si\u0002111\u0003 substrates. Before introduction into\nthe growth chamber, the substrates are chemically treated in\nHF \u000210% in water\u0003 for 1 min, and then rinsed in deionized\nwater. The deposition rate of GaAs is set at 1 monolayer per\nsecond \u0002ML\/s\u0003 \u0002\u00040.28 nm \/s\u0003, as measured on a separate\nGaAs\u0002100\u0003 substrate by the reflection high-energy electron\ndiffraction \u0002RHEED\u0003 oscillation technique. A conventional\narsenic source producing As tetramers is used. Before the\ngrowth of NWs, the substrate temperature \u0002measured by a\ncalibrated pyrometer\u0003 is increased to the desired value within\nthe range 560\u2013630 \u00b0C, and is kept constant during the\nwhole growth run. In this temperature window, a native ox-\nide layer on Si\u0002111\u0003 substrate looses continuity and openings\n\u0002i.e., the holes penetrating through the oxide toward the sub-\nstrate surface\u0003 are formed.33 The surface density of openings\ndepends on the temperature. Above 630 \u00b0C, the oxide layer\nis completely desorbed, as detected by the corresponding\ntransformation of RHEED pattern. After the formation of\nopenings, the Ga flux is supplied to the surface for 5 s while\nthe As shutter is closed. This initiates the formation of Ga\ndroplets in the openings. To ensure the deposition conditions\nproviding the NW growth, the As4 \/Ga flux ratio is decreased\ndown to \u00040.4. When the As flux is switched on, the NW\ngrowth is started after an incubation time. The latter is\nclearly detected by the transformation of the RHEED pattern\nand typically amounts to 2\u201310 s, depending on the tempera-\nture. Total growth time is 20 min in all cases. During the NW\ngrowth, the RHEED pattern features pronounced three-\ndimensional spots of cubic ZB phase regardless of the tem-\nperature. The spot structure does not change during the\nwhole growth run excluding the very final stage after the Ga\nshutter is closed. At this stage, the RHEED pattern converts\nto a mixture of spots resulting from the diffraction from ZB\nand WZ lattices.\nA typical scanning electron microscopy \u0002SEM\u0003 image of\nthe sample grown at 590 \u00b0C is presented in Fig. 1, where the\ndroplets seated on the tops of the longest NWs are clearly\nseen. A small fraction of short NWs that do not seem to have\nthe droplets on top will be ignored in the foregoing analysis.\nStatistical analysis of the SEM images of different samples\nallowed evaluation of the substrate temperature dependence\nof the NW length and surface density. It is found that the\naverage length of 1.8\u20131.9 \u0004m, and the density of \u00041\nFIG. 1. \u0002Color online\u0003 \u0002a\u0003 Lateral cross-section view SEM image of GaAs NWs on Si\u0002111\u0003 substrate grown at 590 \u00b0C, the inset shows\nthe hexagonal NW cross section ; \u0002b\u0003 the substrate temperature dependences of the average length and surface density of Ga-catalyzed NWs.\nCIRLIN et al.

At higher temperatures, the\nNW density increases up to \u00044\u0005108 cm\u22122 at 630 \u00b0C while\nthe length behavior is nonmonotonic, first increasing up to\n\u00043 \u0004m at 610 \u00b0C and than decreasing down to \u00042.5 \u0004m\nat 630 \u00b0C. Energy-dispersive x-ray analysis after growth\nshows that the droplet consists of pure Ga. All NWs have\nalmost uniform diameters of \u000470\u201380 nm from base to top.\nThese values are lower than the critical diameter for coherent\nepitaxial growth of GaAs on Si\u0002111\u0003 \u0002i.e., 110 nm\u0003.6 The\naverage length of 1.8 \u0004m corresponds to the average NW\ngrowth rate of 1.5 nm\/s. At a higher temperature of 610 \u00b0C,\nthe NW growth rate reaches its maximum at 2.5 nm\/s. The\nobserved NW growth rates are 5.4\u20138.9 times higher than the\ndeposition rate of 0.28 nm\/s so that the NW length is much\nlarger than the deposition thickness. This proves the\ndiffusion-induced mode of NW growth with major contribu-\ntions from the adatom migration to the top, as is usual during\nMBE.9,12,19,22,34\nIn common with the first-type NWs in Ref. 30, our data\nclearly show the presence of a Ga droplet on top of most\nNWs. We therefore propose the following growth mecha-\nnism: initial droplets formed in the openings in the absence\nof an As flux must consist of pure liquid Ga. When the As\ndeposition is started, the growth species are supplied to the\ndroplet by direct impingement and, more importantly, by sur-\nface diffusion. The corresponding diffusion fluxes are driven\nby the difference in chemical potentials on the surface and in\nthe droplet. Rather than being a chemical catalyst as in the\nMOCVD case, the droplet acts as a material collector.19\nSince stoichiometric GaAs cannot be formed in the liquid\nvolume \u0002because of its low As content\u0003, Ga and As are trans-\nferred through the droplet to the solid surface \u0002initially Si\nand then GaAs\u0003, where a supersaturated liquid crystallizes in\nthe VLS fashion via 2D nucleation.18\u201320 After the steady-\nstate growth mode is achieved, the droplet size and shape\nremains constant due to a dynamic balance between the\nGaAs arrival to the droplet and the GaAs sink at the liquid-\nsolid interface.35 The latter provides continuous building of\nNW MLs. Effectively, liquid Ga now plays the role of Au in\nthe standard Au-assisted NW growth. As demonstrated by\nthe SEM image in Fig. 1, the contact angles of all droplets\nafter growth are larger than 110\u00b0.\nThe prevalent NW growth direction is \u0005111\u0006, however a\nsmall fraction of NWs are tilted randomly with respect to the\nsubstrate surface. Using SEM, we indexed the sidewall facets\nagainst the \u0005110\u0006 cleavage planes of the substrate. Regardless\nof the substrate temperature, the NW cross section is a regu-\nlar hexagon with six equivalent lateral facets \u0002as shown in\nthe inset of Fig. 1\u0003, identified as being of \u0002211\u0003 family. Since\nthe facets are of the \u000221\u00af1\u00af\u0003 type, there are important consid-\nerations with respect to sidewall surface energies, discussed\nin the next section.\nFor transmission electron microscopy \u0002TEM\u0003 investiga-\ntions of the crystal structure, the NWs are scraped from the\nsubstrate with a scalpel, transferred to holey carbon films and\nanalyzed using a JEOL 2100F TEM operated at 200 kV.\nConventional bright-field TEM imaging of the NWs com-\nbined with selected area diffraction and phase contrast lattice\nimaging, is used to identify the crystal structures. The NWs\ngrown at different temperatures were checked for crystal\nstructure, twining, and stacking faults over their entire\nlength, Fig. 2 showing typical TEM images. It was found\nthat the majority of the length of the NWs adopted the ZB\nphase, but that the region immediately beneath the Ga drop-\nlet had the WZ crystal structure \u0005Fig. 3\u0002a\u0003, region B\u0006, the\nmaterial having undergone a transition \u0002region C\u0003. Indeed the\ntwins, stacking faults, and polytypes associated with WZ-ZB\nphase instability are better known for the case of the II-VI\nsemiconductors, for which the stabilization energy is gener-\nally lower than the III-Vs \u0002see Ref. 36 for a description\u0003.\nClose examination of region C in Fig. 3 shows how the\npurely ZB part transforms via the introduction of single\nstacking faults, then narrow twin lamellae, followed by ran-\ndom stacking, the WZ structure with some stacking faults\nand ultimately the pure WZ phase. As mentioned already, the\nphase mixing \u0002stacking transition\u0003 happens only when the\nGa-supplying flux is stopped, and is therefore associated\nwith an abrupt change in growth conditions.\nIII.

Estimates in Ref. 37, based on\nsimply counting the density of dangling bonds created by the\ndissection of crystal by the corresponding vertical planes,\ngive the following values: \u0006WV=1.73 J \/m2 for the \u000221\u00af1\u00af\u0003 ZB\nplane, 1.30 J \/m2 for the \u000211\u00af00\u0003 WZ plane, and 1.50 for the\n\u0002112\u00af0\u0003 WZ plane. Therefore, the \u201cdirect\u201d \u000221\u00af1\u00af\u0003\u2192 \u000211\u00af00\u0003\nZB-WZ transition with parallel sidewall planes yields a 25%\nsurface energy gain while the \u201cindirect\u201d \u000221\u00af1\u00af\u0003\u2192 \u0002112\u00af0\u0003\nZB-WZ transition \u0002associated with 30\u00b0 angular rotation of\nthe entire NW\u0003 yields a 13% gain. Therefore, the ZB-WZ\nphase transition should be most favored for the case of \u000221\u00af1\u00af\u0003\nfacets.\nTo explain the observed ZB phase of our NWs, we use the\nnucleation model of Ref. 18, illustrated in Fig. 4. We assume\nthat the NW growth is mediated by the nucleation of 2D\nislands, where the formation of nuclei having the WZ orien-\ntation on a ZB NW template can happen at the liquid-solid\ninterface \u0002C\u0003 \u0005Fig. 4\u0002a\u0003\u0006 or at the TL \u0005Fig. 4\u0002b\u0003\u0006. In the latter\ncase, a fraction x of WZ nucleus perimeter is in contact with\nthe vapor. Under the assumption of phase-independent sur-\nface energy of lateral solid-liquid interface \u0002i.e., \u0006SL=const\nfor the ZB and WZ nuclei because of the close atomic envi-\nronments on the surface around the two types of nuclei18,19\u0003,\nthe formation enthalpy of a monolayer island with surface\narea A and perimeter P is given by19\n\u0007G = \u2212 \u0007\u0007\u0004 \u2212 \b \u2212 2\u0006LV\u0002\tS \u2212\tL\u0003sin \nR \bAh\tS + \u000bPh . \u00021\u0003\nHere, \u0007\u0004 is the chemical potential in the liquid phase with\nrespect to ZB solid state, \b is the stacking-fault energy \u0002\b\n=0 for ZB and \b=\bWZ\f0 for WZ nucleus\u0003, \tS and \tL are\nthe elementary volumes in the solid and liquid phase, respec-\ntively, R is the NW radius, \n is the contact angle of the\ndroplet, and h is the height of a ML. The R-dependent term\nin Eq. \u00021\u0003 accounts for the Gibbs-Thomson \u0002GT\u0003 effect. The\neffective lateral surface energy \u000b is written down as\n\u000b = \u00021 \u2212 x\u0003\u0006SL + x\u0002\u0006WV \u2212 \u0006LV sin \n\u0003 . \u00022\u0003\nHere, \u0006SL is the surface energy of lateral solid-liquid inter-\nface, \u0006LV is the surface energy of liquid droplet, x=0 for the\nC nucleation, and x\f0 for the TL nucleation. Since \u000bC\n=\u0006SL is identical for ZB and WZ nuclei, the GT term \u0002at\n\ts\tconst for the both phases\u0003 is phase independent and\n\bWZ\f0, the C nucleation always occurs preferentially in the\nZB phase. The formation of a WZ layer therefore necessarily\nrequires the TL nucleation.18 This happens only when the TL\nnucleation barrier for a WZ nucleus is lower than the C one.\nFrom Eqs. \u00021\u0003 and \u00022\u0003, the difference \u0007GTL\u2212\u0007GC equals\n\u0007GTL \u2212 \u0007GC = xPh\u0002\u0006WV \u2212 \u0006SL \u2212 \u0006LV sin \n\u0003 . \u00023\u0003\nA given nucleus therefore tend to form at the TL provided\nthat18\n\u0007\u0006 = \u0006WV \u2212 \u0006SL \u2212 \u0006LV sin \n \r 0, \u00024\u0003\nwhere the sidewall surface energy \u0006WV should be taken for\nWZ sidewall planes.\nFor further estimates, we use the values of surface ener-\ngies of Ref. 19: \u0006WV=1.3 J \/m2, \u0006SL=0.59 J \/m2, and \u0006LV\n=1.0 J \/m2. According to Refs. 38 and 39, the surface energy\nof pure liquid Au equals 1.145 J \/m2 at temperature Tm\n=1065 \u00b0C, and the surface energy of pure liquid Ga amounts\nto 0.711 J \/m2 at temperature Tm=30 \u00b0C. As in Ref. 40, we\naccount for the decrease in liquid surface energy at higher\ntemperatures using the linear interpolation formula\n\u0006LV\u0002T\u0003 = \u0006LV\u0002Tm\u0003 \u2212 c\u0002T \u2212 Tm\u0003 , \u00025\u0003\nwhere T is the growth temperature. With this approximation\nand the known coefficients c \u0005c=2.0\u000510\u22124 J \/ \u0002m2\u0005 \u00b0C\u0003 for\nAu and 7.0\u000510\u22125 J \/ \u0002m2\u0005 \u00b0C\u0003 for Ga\u0006,38,39 we arrive at\n\u0006LV=1.24 J \/m2 for pure Au and \u0006LV=0.67 J \/m2 for pure\nGa at typical MBE growth temperature T=590 \u00b0C. The\nvalue of \u0006LV=1.0 J \/m2 therefore corresponds to approxi-\nmately 40% Ga concentration in the Au-Ga alloy during the\nFIG. 3.

After growth, all our droplets have contact angles\nbetween 110\u00b0 and 125\u00b0\u0002the contact angles should be even\nlarger during the growth when the droplets contain more Ga\nand some As\u0003. With these \n, we obtain \u0007\u0006 from \u22120.23 to\n\u22120.11 J \/m2 for the Au-assisted growth so Eq. \u00024\u0003 would be\nsafely satisfied and the TL nucleation of WZ nuclei would be\nindeed preferable. In our Ga-catalyzed growth, under stan-\ndard assumption of a low concentration of As in the\ndroplet,18,19 the liquid-vapor surface energy is decreased to\nits value for pure liquid Ga, \u0006LV=0.67 J \/m2. This yields\npositive \u0007\u0006 form 0.08 to 0.16 J \/m2 so that the TL nucle-\nation becomes energetically suppressed. Changing the cata-\nlyst to a lower surface-energy liquid makes the substitution\nof its surface to a more energetically costly wire-vapor inter-\nface unfavorable. It should be noted, however, that our esti-\nmates lead to rather small positive values of \u0007\u0006. This may\nqualitatively explain the onset of twinning defects and WZ\nphase at the end of growth, where the droplet decreases in\nsize and consequently the contact angle changes as some Ga\nis emptied into the solid NW phase.\nIt is noteworthy that whenever the TL nucleation condi-\ntion given by Eq. \u00024\u0003 is broken, the crystal structure should\nbe less dependent on the liquid supersaturation and the fac-\ntors influencing the latter, such as the temperature and ar-\nsenic flux. The arsenic pressure can, however, change the\nsurface energy of sidewall facets \u0006WV but this dependence is\ncompletely unknown for the WZ NWs. As regards the tem-\nperature behavior, our experiments \u0002performed at fixed\nAs4 \/Ga flux ratio\u0003 reveal pure ZB phase in the entire growth\nwindow from 560\u2013630 \u00b0C, where we are able to form the\nNWs by the self-catalyzed growth procedure described here-\ninabove. Our nucleation model was aimed to identifying the\nmajor effect of a lower surface energy of growth catalyst, not\nyet to give a complete description of the complex interplay\nof the two phases, including the observed phase mixing upon\nthe growth termination.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nTo summarize, we have demonstrated the Au-free, self-\ncatalyzed MBE growth of GaAs NWs having the pure ZB\nstructure on Si\u0002111\u0003 substrates. The unexpected phase purity\nis attributed to the substitution of the growth catalyst from\nthe conventional liquid Au-Ga alloy to pure liquid Ga, whose\nsurface energy is much lower and therefore suppress the TL\nnucleation. Overall, since the necessary condition for the WZ\nphase formation involves surface energies, an appropriate\nchoice of the growth catalyst and\/or the vapor environment\naround the droplet can provide a powerful method for the\nfabrication of pure ZB NWs. This is important for the mono-\nlithic integration of chemically pure and stacking-fault-free\nIII-V NWs on silicon. Whenever the TL nucleation becomes\nenergetically unfavorable, ZB crystal structure should be-\ncome less dependent on the growth conditions and the diam-\neter. We now plan to use the self-catalyzed MBE growth for\nother NWs of III-V compounds and to investigate their crys-\ntal structure from the viewpoint of the obtained results. To\nthis end, the existing nucleation models18\u201320,25 are effectively\nsingle component and therefore do not include the influence\nof group V element neither on the liquid phase supersatura-\ntion nor on the surface energies. We intend to develop a\nself-consistent NW growth model to account for these ef-\nfects.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was partially supported by the Russian Federal\nAgency for Science and Innovation \u0002Contract No.\n02.740.11.0383\u0003, scientific programs of Russian Academy of\nSciences and few grants of Russian Foundation for Basic\nResearch, and also by FP7 EU project POLALAS.\n*Corresponding author; cirlin@beam.ioffe.ru\n1W.
