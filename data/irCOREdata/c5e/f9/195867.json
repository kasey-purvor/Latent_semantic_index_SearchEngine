In its crystal structure, the two flavins are close together,\npositioned for interflavin electron transfer but not for electron\ntransfer to cytochromeP450. A number of lines of evidence sug-\ngest that domain motion is important in the action of the\nenzyme. We report NMR and small-angle x-ray scattering ex-\nperiments addressing directly the question of domain organiza-\ntion in human CPR. Comparison of the 1H-15N heteronuclear\nsingle quantum correlation spectrum of CPR with that of the\nisolated FMNdomain permitted identification of residues in the\nFMN domain whose environment differs in the two situations.\nThese include several residues that are solvent-exposed in the\nCPR crystal structure, indicating the existence of a second con-\nformation in which the FMN domain is involved in a different\ninterdomain interface. Small-angle x-ray scattering experi-\nments showed that oxidized and NADPH-reduced CPRs have\ndifferent overall shapes. The scattering curve of the reduced\nenzyme can be adequately explained by the crystal structure,\nwhereas analysis of the data for the oxidized enzyme indicates\nthat it exists as amixture of approximately equal amounts of two\nconformations, one consistent with the crystal structure and\none a more extended structure consistent with that inferred\nfrom the NMR data. The correlation between the effects of\nadenosine 2\u0003,5\u0003-bisphosphate and NADPH on the scattering\ncurve and their effects on the rate of interflavin electron transfer\nsuggests that this conformational equilibrium is physiologically\nrelevant.\nThe cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase system in the\nmammalian endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for oxida-\ntive metabolism of both endogenous compounds, including\nfatty acids, steroids, and prostaglandins, and exogenous com-\npounds ranging from therapeutic drugs and environmental\ntoxins to carcinogens (1).Within this enzyme system,NADPH-\ncytochrome P450 reductase (CPR4; EC 1.6.2.4) plays a central\nrole by catalyzing the transfer of electrons fromNADPH, via its\ntwo flavin cofactors FMN and FAD, to the cytochromes P450\n(2). CPR is also an electron donor to heme oxygenase (3), the\nfatty acid elongation system (4), and cytochrome b5 (5). More\nrecently, CPR has been found to carry out in vivo reductive\nactivation of anticancer prodrugs in a hypoxia-specificmanner,\nresulting in amarkedly cytotoxic effect on tumors (6, 7), andhas\nthus also become a target in anticancer therapy (8, 9). CPR is a\nmember of a small family of diflavin reductases, including the\nisoforms of nitric-oxide synthase (10), methionine synthase\nreductase (11), protein NR1 (12), cytochrome P450 BM3 (13),\nand sulfite reductase (14), each of which catalyzes electron\ntransfer through the pathway NAD(P)H 3 FAD 3 FMN 3\nacceptor.\nSequence analysis indicates that CPR comprises three identifi-\nable domains: a hydrophobicN-terminal domain that anchors the\nenzyme to the membrane, an FMN-binding domain homolo-\ngous to bacterial flavodoxins, and an (FAD\u0001NADPH)-binding\ndomain homologous to ferredoxin-NADP\u0001 reductases, leading\nto the proposal that the enzyme evolved as the product of a\nfusion of two ancestral flavoproteins (15). The latter two puta-\ntive domains were expressed separately and shown to fold cor-\nrectly and to bind their respective cofactors (16). The crystal\nstructure of a soluble form of the enzyme lacking the mem-\nbrane-anchoring N-terminal 70 residues (see Fig. 1) (17) con-\nfirmed the existence of these domains and their structural and\nsequence homology to flavodoxin and ferredoxin-NADP\u0001\nreductase, respectively. The structure reveals two additional\nimportant features: (i) the existence, as an insert in the FAD-\nbinding domain, of a \u201clinker domain\u201d that may serve to deter-\nmine the mutual orientation of the FMN- and FAD-binding\ndomains and (ii) the fact that the FMN-binding domain is con-\nnected to the rest of the protein through a loop or hinge of 13\n* This work was supported by grants from the Biotechnology and Biological\nSciences Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.\nAuthor\u2019s Choice\u2014Final version full access.\n\u0002 This article was selected as a Paper of the Week.\n\u25a1S The on-line version of this article (available at http:\/\/www.jbc.org) contains\na supplemental figure.\n1 Present address: School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent Uni-\nversity, Nottingham NG1 4BU, UK.\n2 Present address: School of Biological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liver-\npool L69 7ZB, UK.\n3 Towhomcorrespondence should be addressed: HenryWellcome Laborato-\nries for Structural Biology, Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Leicester,\nHenry Wellcome Bldg., P.

As a result, domain move-\nment in CPR is widely anticipated to play an important role in\nits physiological function (e.g. Refs. 2 and 18\u201321), and we sug-\ngested previously (2) that CPR might exist in an equilibrium\nbetween the structure observed in the crystal and one in which\nthe FMN-binding domain couldmove freely with respect to the\nrest of the protein, being connected only by the flexible hinge\nsequence.However, differential scanning calorimetrymeasure-\nments (22)5 are consistent with a single cooperative unfolding\nprocess, suggesting that the FMN-binding domain is closely\nassociated with the FAD-binding domain. Experimental evi-\ndence supporting the importance of domain motion in the\nfunction of CPR comes from the observations that either the\naddition of high concentrations of glycerol (23) or the deletion\nof several amino acids from the flexible loop connecting the\nFMN-binding domain to the rest of the protein (22, 24) leads to\na drastic decrease in the rate of interflavin electron transfer. A\nwide range of kinetic studies of the isoforms of nitric-oxide\nsynthase, anothermember of the diflavin reductase family, have\nalso been interpreted in terms of a movement of the FMN-\nbinding domain as an obligatory part of the mechanism (see\nRefs. 25\u201327 and references therein).\nCrystallographic studies of CPR mutants provide evidence\nfor the existence of somemobility of the FMN-binding domain\nrelative to the FAD-binding domain (28), whereas in the struc-\nture of the homologous flavoprotein subunit of sulfite reduc-\ntase, the FMN-binding domain was absent from the electron\ndensity maps, implying a substantial degree of mobility (14).\nThe most direct structural evidence for domain mobility has\ncome from recent crystallographic studies of a mutant of rat\nCPR inwhich four residues (236TGEE239) were deleted from the\nhinge (24) and of a chimeric enzyme consisting of the yeast\nFMN-binding domain and the human linker and FAD-binding\ndomains (29). In both cases, the mutants showed a change in\nthe relative orientation and position of the FMN- and FAD-\nbinding domains such that the FMNwas farther from the FAD\nand more solvent-accessible.\nWe now report the use of a combination of NMR and small-\nangle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to address directly the question of\ndomain organization in the soluble form of wild-type human\nCPR. These experiments provide evidence for the existence in\nCPR of a two-state equilibrium between a compact conforma-\ntion (consistentwith the crystal structure) and amore extended\nstate that may be the form that transfers electrons to cyto-\nchromes P450. The position of this equilibrium is affected by\nthe binding of ligands to the coenzyme-binding site in a way\nconsistent with their effects on interdomain electron transfer.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nMaterials\u2014NADPH, 2\u0003,5\u0003-ADP, NADH, and horse heart\ncytochrome c were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals\nwere of analytical grade.\nProtein Expression and Purification\u2014The gene for human\nfibroblast CPR lacking the N-terminal membrane-anchoring\nregion (a kind gift from Professor C. R. Wolf, University of\nDundee) was subcloned into pCS22, a plasmid vector in which\nexpression of the target protein is under the control of the cold\nshock promoter (30). CPR was expressed in Escherichia coli\nBL21 Star cells carrying the pCS22 plasmid construct. Cells\nwere grown to mid-log phase in 2YT broth at 42 \u00b0C prior to\ninduction by reducing the growth temperature to 18 \u00b0C.\n2H,15N-Labeled CPR was produced from cells grown in E. coli\nOD2 DN medium (Silantes). CPR was purified as described\npreviously (31). The protein concentrationwas calculated using\na molar extinction coefficient of \u0001450 nm \u0004 22,000 M\u00051 cm\u00051.\nCytochrome c reduction assays were carried out in 0.3 M potas-\nsium phosphate (pH 7.7) with 50 \u0002M cytochrome c and 50 \u0002M\nNADPH at 25 \u00b0C.\nThe segment of the CPR gene coding for the FMN domain\n(residues 61\u2013239) was amplified by PCR, introducing NdeI and\nSapI restriction sites to enable cloning into the pTWIN2 vector\n(NewEngland Biolabs) in-framewith theMth RIR1 intein. This\nconstruct allowed expression of the isolated FMN domain with\na C-terminal intein\/chitin-binding domain affinity tag as a self-\ncleavable fusion protein. 2H,13C,15N-Labeled FMNdomainwas\nproduced from cells grown in E. coliOD2CDNmedium (Silan-\ntes) at 28 \u00b0C and induced at mid-log phase by addition of 0.05\nmM isopropyl \u0003-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Harvested cells were\nresuspended in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0) containing 500 mM\nNaCl and 1 mM EDTA.

Protein was\nstored at\u000520 \u00b0C in buffer containing 50% glycerol. The pro-\ntein concentration was calculated using a molar extinction\ncoefficient of \u0001450 nm \u0004 11,000 M\u00051 cm\u00051.\nNMR Spectroscopy\u2014NMR samples of 1.5 mM 2H,13C,15N-\nlabeled FMN-binding domain and 0.5 mM 2H,15N-labeled CPR\nwere prepared in 30 mM BES (pH 6.5) containing 10% D2O.\nAll NMR experiments were performed at 25 \u00b0C on Bruker\nAVANCE DRX 600 and AVANCE DRX 800 spectrometers\nequipped with CryoProbes. Proton chemical shifts were refer-\nenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid. The\n15N and 13C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using\nrecommended gyromagnetic ratios (32). Spectra were pro-\ncessed with TopSpin (Bruker) and analyzed using CCPN Anal-\nysis (33). Three-dimensional HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB,\nand HN(CO)CACB experiments were used to adjust reported\nassignments (34) of the isolated FMN-binding domain. Chem-\nical shift differences between the isolated FMN-binding\ndomain and the domain in the full CPR molecule were evalu-\nated from comparison of the 1H,15Nheteronuclear single quan-\ntum correlation (HSQC) spectra using the minimum chemical\nshift difference approach. All cross-peaks were picked in the\nCPR spectrum, and for each cross-peak in the FMN spectrum,\nthe minimum distance to a CPR cross-peak (\u0006\u0004(HN,N)) was\ncalculated using the equation \u0006\u0004(HN,N) \u0004 \u0007[(\u0006\u0004HWH)2 \u0001\n(\u0006\u0004NWN)2], whereWH andWN are weighting factors for the 1H\nand 15N amide shifts, respectively (WH\u0004 1,WN\u0004 0.154; BMRB\nData Bank; Refs. 35 and 36), and\u0006\u0004\u0004 \u0004CPR\u0005 \u0004FMN. The chem-\nical shiftswere compared automatically using a computer script\nwithout any attempt to adjust the cross-peakmapping between\nthe two spectra.\nSolution X-ray Scattering Data Collection and Analysis\u2014\nSAXS measurements were carried out at Station 2.1 of the Sci-\nence and Technology Facilities Council Synchrotron Radiation\nSource (Daresbury, UK) using a position-sensitive multiwire\nproportional counter. Scattering profiles were collected at two\ndifferent sample-to-detector distances, 1 and 4.25 m, using\nsample concentrations of 15\u0002M (1mg\/ml), 45\u0002M (3mg\/ml), 75\n\u0002M (5mg\/ml), and 150\u0002M (10mg\/ml) in 30mMBES (pH 7.0) at\n25 \u00b0C. To prepare NADPH-reduced enzyme, solutions of\nNADPH and CPR were prepared anaerobically in syringes\nlinked by flexible tubing, to give defined concentrations upon\nmixing, prior to transfer to the observation cell and collection of\nSAXS data.\nReduction and analysis of scattering data were performed as\ndescribed previously (37). The radius of gyration (Rg), the max-\nimum linear dimension (Dmax), the intraparticle distance dis-\ntribution function (P(r)), and the forward scattering intensity\nwere calculated from the experimental scattering data using the\nindirect Fourier transform method with the program GNOM\n(38). Model-independent molecular shapes were calculated\nusing GASBOR (39). This ab initio procedure represents the\nprotein as an assembly of spherical \u201cdummy residues\u201d and uses\nsimulated annealing to find the three-dimensional arrange-\nment of these dummy residues that gives optimum agreement\nwith the experimental scattering data. Twenty independent\nGASBOR runs were averaged using DAMAVER (40) and\nSUPCOMB (41) to obtain a typical molecular shape. Scattering\nprofile simulations from crystal coordinates were carried out\nusing CRYSOL (42). The data were also analyzed using the\nensemble optimizationmethod (EOM) (43). In this approach, a\npool of 10,000 conformers is calculated by starting from the\ncrystal structure, defining the flexible \u201chinge\u201d region, and, on\nthis basis, moving the FMN-binding domain relative to the\nFAD-binding domain. The scattering curve for each of these\nconformers is calculated, and then a genetic algorithm is used\nto find the optimum combination of these scattering curves to\naccount for the experimental data. This method is thus able to\ndeal with mixtures of conformers.\nRESULTS ANDDISCUSSION\nNMR Spectroscopy\u2014Despite its relatively large size (67 kDa),\nCPR gives reasonably well resolvedNMR spectra (Fig. 2A). This\nallowed us to compare the 1H,15N HSQC spectra of 2H,15N-\nlabeled CPR with the corresponding spectrum of the isolated\nFMN-binding domain, which we had previously assigned (34),\nto compare the environment of the residues in this domain in\nthe two situations (Fig. 2B). The comparison was made using\nthe \u201cminimum chemical shift approach,\u201d in which for each\ncross-peak in the assigned 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of the iso-\nlated FMN domain, we identified the nearest cross-peak in the\nunassigned spectrum of CPR. This conservative approach may\nunderestimate the shift differences in crowded regions of the\nspectrum and will clearly not identify all those residues whose\nenvironment is different in the two situations, it but has proved\nto be a reliable indicator of the location of ligand-binding sites\nin proteins and will similarly provide a valuable indication of\nwhich parts of the FMN-binding domain interact with the rest\nof CPR. It should be noted that the crystal structure of the\nisolated FMN-binding domain (44) is closely similar to that of\nthe corresponding domain within the crystal structure of CPR\n(17), with a root mean square deviation of 0.29 \u00c5 for the back-\nbone atoms, so any 15N-1H chemical shift differences are very\nlikely to reflect domain-domain interactions rather than struc-\ntural differences.\nFig. 3 depicts those residues in the FMN-binding domain\nshowing minimumNH chemical shift changes of\u00050.075 ppm,\nmapped onto the crystal structure of CPR. There are no chem-\nical shift changes evident in residues in the \u201cbottom hemi-\nsphere\u201d of the FMN-binding domain in the orientation shown\nin Fig. 3, whereas, as would be expected, residues that are in\ncontact with the FAD-binding domain in the crystal structure,\nnotably those in the loops surrounding the FMNcofactor and in\nhelix 85\u201393, do display clear chemical shift differences.\nHowever, it is notable that residues throughout the \u201cupper\nhemisphere\u201d of the FMN-binding domain in the orientation in\nFig. 3 showdifferences in chemical shift; these are not limited to\nresidues at the interface with the FAD-binding domain in the\ncrystal structure.

Similarly, Leu205, which shows a clear difference in\nchemical shift, is in a short \u0003-strand lying alongside this helix\nand is also distant from the interdomain interfaces. There is\nalso a group of residues, including Val70, Lys75, Asn79, Ala102,\nArg108, and Met110, at the far end of the FMN-binding domain\nfrom the FMN that show clear chemical shift changes; with the\nsole exception of Ala102, these residues are substantially sol-\nvent-exposed in the crystal structure.6\nIt follows that the FMN-binding domain must spend part of\nthe time in a position that differs both from the crystal structure\nand froma freelymoving \u201cball on a string\u201d state because, in both\nthese situations, the residues on helix F and at the far end of the\ndomain from the FMN would be solvent-exposed and would\nthus have chemical shifts very similar to those in the isolated\ndomain. The fact that residues in\nthe FMN-binding domain that are\ndistant from the interdomain\ninterface seen in the crystal struc-\nture show chemical shift differ-\nences suggests that theymay be part\nof a different interdomain interface.\nSolutionX-ray Scattering Studies\u2014\nThe evidence fromNMR thus suggests\nthat CPR exists in an equilibrium\nbetween (at least) two conforma-\ntions that differ in the orientation\nof the FMN-binding domain. We\ninvestigated this further by SAXS\nstudies of CPR under a number of\ndifferent conditions. Fig. 4 com-\npares the experimental scattering\nprofiles of oxidized CPR (CPRox)\n(22) and 4-electron reduced CPR\n(CPRhq; prepared under anaerobic conditions with a 10-fold\nexcess of NADPH).7 It is clear that these curves are not super-\nimposable, demonstrating that CPR undergoes significant\nstructural changes upon reduction by NADPH. This is further\nillustrated by the values for Dmax and Rg (distribution of scat-\nteringmass) calculated from the scattering data, which are pre-\nsented in Table 1. The clear differences in these two parameters\nbetween CPRox and the fully reduced, coenzyme-bound\nenzyme show that CPR is able to adopt at least two distinct\nconformations in solution. The differences between the two\nconformations are even more apparent when comparing the\nP(r) functions, directly calculated from the scattering curves.\nThis function provides a histogramof the interatomic distances\nwithin the molecule, giving information on shape and maxi-\n6 In the crystal structure, the \u0001-aminogroupof Lys75 iswithinhydrogen-bond-\ning distance of the carboxylate of Glu354, a residue on a loop of the linker\ndomain; however, these residues are essentially completely solvent-ex-\nposed, and this interaction may not be significant in solution.\n7 The4-electron reduced speciesmaynotbephysiologically relevant (45), but\nit represents a stable reduced stateof theenzyme that can conveniently be\nstudied under the conditions of the SAXS experiment.\nFIGURE 3.Residues in theFMN-bindingdomain showingNHchemical shift differencesbetweenCPRand\nthe isolated FMN-binding domainmapped onto the crystal structure of CPR.

The comparison of the P(r) functions for CPRox and\nCPRhq (Fig. 4, inset) clearly shows that CPR adopts different\nconformations in these two states, with CPRox having a more\nextended shapewith a broaderP(r) (in agreementwith its larger\nDmax and Rg values).\nShape reconstructions from the experimental scattering pro-\nfiles of CPRox and CPRhq were performed using the established\nab initio dummy residue procedure of the program GASBOR\n(39) and averaged by DAMAVER (40). Fig. 5A shows the low\nresolution molecular envelope obtained for CPRhq, the 4-elec-\ntron reduced state. As implied by the Dmax and P(r) data\nreported above, the calculated envelope indicates a compact,\nmore or less spherical shape for this state of the enzyme, which\ncorresponds reasonably well to the crystal structure of rat CPR\n(17). The few parts of the crystal structure that extend some-\nwhat outside the calculated envelope tend to be those with\nhigher B-factors.\nBy contrast, the molecular envelope derived from the SAXS\ndata for CPRox, the oxidized form of the enzymewithout bound\ncoenzyme, is significantlymore elongated (Fig. 5B). In this case,\nthe crystal structure is a very poor fit to the envelope, leaving\none end of the calculated volume empty while the FMN-bind-\ning domain protrudes outside the envelope. This observation\ndemonstrates clearly that the crystal structure is not the only\nconformation accessible to wild-type CPR in solution and sup-\nports the idea of domain reorganization within CPR upon\nchanges in redox state and\/or coenzyme binding.\nModel for an Extended Conformer of CPR\u2014Because the\nSAXS data show that in the oxidized state CPR can adopt a\nconformation that is more extended than that seen in the crys-\ntal, we sought to construct a model that accounts both for the\nSAXS data and for the information from NMR implicating a\ngroup of residues in and near helix F of the FMN-binding\ndomain. We postulated that the FMN-binding domain might\nrotate across the surface of the linker domain to make a new\ninterface involving these latter residues. This simple model of\nan extended CPR is shown in Fig. 5C. When superimposed on\nthe molecular envelope for CPRox, it is apparent that this\nextended model does help to account for the extended molec-\nular envelope, occupying space that is left empty by the crystal\nstructure. However, it also leaves some unoccupied space mid-\nway along the envelope, which is occupied by the FMN-binding\ndomain of the crystal structure in Fig. 5B.\nHence, neither of these two conformations alone is able to\naccount for the molecular envelope of CPRox calculated from\nthe SAXS data; rather, a good fit appears to require amixture of\nthe two. This is indicated by the P(r) plots in Fig. 5D, which\nshow that a 50:50 mixture of the two does fit the experimental\ndata.\nEffects of Reduction and Ligand Binding\u2014To further probe\nthe effect of reduction and coenzyme binding on the shape of\nCPR, we collected SAXS data for CPR reduced to the 2-electron\nlevel by stoichiometric amounts ofNADPH (CPR semiquinone;\nCPRsq), and CPR reduced to the 4-electron level by NADH.\nNADP\u0001 binds tightly to the enzyme, so in the two samples\nreduced by NADPH, the reduced CPR will have NADP\u0001\nbound, whereas after reduction by NADH, the weakly binding\nNAD\u0001 will not remain bound at the concentrations used (46).\nThe Dmax and Rg values for these samples are given in Table 1,\nand the P(r) curves are in the supplemental figure. After addi-\ntion of stoichiometric amounts of NADPH, CPRsq exists as a\nmixture of the FAD\u0004\/FMN\u0004 and FAD\/FMNH2 species (23, 47)\nwithNADP\u0001 bound. In this case, as shown in Table 1,Dmax and\nRg are decreased (corresponding to an increase in the propor-\ntion of the compact form) but not to the same extent as by the\nbinding of NADPH and reduction to the CPRhq state. By con-\ntrast, reduction to the CPRhq state by NADH has essentially no\neffect on the shape of the enzyme as judged by the Dmax and Rg\nvalues, indicating that reduction alone is not sufficient to lead to\nthe change in the position of the conformational equilibrium\nproduced by addition of NADPH.\nWe also further analyzed the data on the 2\u0003,5\u0003-ADP complex\nreported previously (22). As shown in Table 1, the Dmax and Rg\nvalues for this sample are intermediate between the extremes\nrepresented by unliganded CPRox and NADP\u0001-bound CPRhq\nand are essentially identical to the values for NADP\u0001-bound\nCPRsq. Importantly, this shows that coenzyme binding alone,\nwithout any change in the redox state of the enzyme, is suffi-\ncient to produce a significant change in the position of the con-\nformational equilibrium, although reduction to the CPRhq\nFIGURE 4.

In\nour model of the extended conformation of human CPR, the\nsolvent-accessible surface area is \t900 \u00c52 greater than in a\nmodel in which the human sequence is built into the crystal\nstructure of the rat enzyme, and the change in relative popula-\ntion of the two states will contribute to the thermodynamics of\n2\u0003,5\u0003-ADP binding. An accurate estimate of this contribution\nmust, however, await a better structural model of the extended\nconformation and a detailed SAXS study of the temperature\ndependence of the equilibrium.\nWe have shown that interflavin electron transfer in human\nCPR is kinetically gated by domain motion. In human CPR\nreduced to the 2-electron level with dithionite, the interflavin\nelectron transfer rate is 11 s\u00051, but this is increased to 35 s\u00051 in\nthe presence of 2\u0003,5\u0003-ADP and to 55 s\u00051 when the reduction is\ncarried out by NADPH (i.e. when NADP\u0001 is bound) (23, 48),\ncorrelating well with the effects of these ligands on the confor-\nmational equilibrium.\nAnalysis of the SAXS Data Using the EOM\u2014Having shown\nthat the scattering data could be accounted for by a mixture of\nconformers, we analyzed the data using the recently described\nEOM(43), which allows an objective approach to the analysis of\nscattering data from flexible proteins.

This indicates that the scattering\ncurve is best described by an\t85:15 mixture of two families of\nconformations with Rg values of \t27 and \t33 \u00c5, respectively.\nThis is in broad agreement with the conclusion drawn above,\nthat the reduced enzyme with coenzyme bound exists in solu-\ntion predominantly8 in a compact conformation similar to the\ncrystal structure (hydrated Rg value calculated from the crystal\nstructure \u0004 26.6 \u00c5), and indeed the fit to the experimental\nscattering curve is very much the same for the mixture derived\nfrom the EOM analysis as for the crystal structure. Representa-\ntive structures for the compact form within the EOM ensem-\nble clearly resemble the crystal structure (Fig. 7). Fig. 6 (C and\nD) shows the corresponding results of the EOM analysis for\nCPRox. Although the fit to the experimental data is less good\nthan for the reduced enzyme (\u00062 value of\t12 versus\t3 for the\nreduced enzyme), two families of conformations are again\nselected by the EOM analysis, with equivalent Rg values of\t27\nand \t32 \u00c5 and similar widths, and these are structurally very\nsimilar to those obtained from the analysis of the data for the\nreduced enzyme (Fig. 7). However, in the case of the oxidized\nenzyme with no ligand bound, the proportions of the two con-\nformational families reveal that equal amounts of the compact\nand extended forms give the best fit to the data8; in Fig. 6, the\nproportions are 50.3% compact and 49.7% extended conforma-\ntion, in agreement with the basic analysis in Fig. 5.\nIt is particularly notable that the EOM analysis provides\nindependent evidence that CPR exists in a two-state equilib-\n8 The accuracyof the EOM isdeterminedby theextent towhich the largepool\nof structures it generates provides an adequate portrayal of all the poten-\ntial conformers and by the procedure of the filtering process (43). Looking\nat the pool of conformations generated for CPR by the EOM (indicated by\nthe dotted line in Fig. 6A, which represents the Rg distribution derived from\nthe pool of structures), some bias toward extended structures is apparent.\nIt is therefore possible that the family of structures characterized by the\nlarger Rg value may be over-represented.\nFIGURE 6.Analysis of SAXSdata for CPRby the EOM.A and B, CPRhq;C andD, CPRox.A andC show the frequency distribution of CPR conformers as a function\nof Rg obtained by this analysis (solid lines) and the distribution of the initial pool of structures generated by the EOM (dotted lines).

Thewidths of each of the two peaks in Fig. 6 (A andC) are\nvery similar to that of the single peak obtained by starting with\nthe crystal structure, generating a theoretical scattering curve\nusing the programCRYSOL, and analyzing this using the EOM.\nThis suggests that each of the two forms is a reasonably well\ndefined conformation. The two conformations are, within the\nlimitations of the low resolution data, very similar for both the\noxidized and reduced enzymes (Fig. 7); the compact conforma-\ntion is similar to the crystal structure. The results of the EOM\nanalysis are thus in agreement with the conclusions from the\nanalysis with GASBOR, using our simple model for the\nextended form of the enzyme, that CPR reduced by NADPH\nexists essentially wholly in a compact conformation consistent\nwith the crystal structure, whereas in the oxidized state the\nenzyme exists approximately half the time in an extended form.\nThe data for all the complexes listed in Table 1were analyzed\nby the EOM. In each case, the experimental data were satisfac-\ntorily accounted for by a mixture of the same two families of\nconformations, with Rg values of\t27 and\t33 \u00c5. The propor-\ntion of the extended conformation in the 2\u0003,5\u0003-ADP complex\nwas estimated to be 33%, intermediate between the values esti-\nmated for the NADPH-reduced and oxidized enzymes; this is\nconsistent with the discussion above on the basis of the Dmax\nand Rg values.\nRelation to the Structures of Mutant CPRs\u2014Hamdane et al.\n(24) have recently reported studies of a rat CPR mutant,\n\u0006TGEE, in which four residues were deleted from the hinge\nregion; this resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of\nthe enzyme to catalyze reduction of cytochrome c or cyto-\nchromeP450 2B4due to a defect in interflavin electron transfer.\nThe crystal structure of the NADP\u0001 complex of the \u0006TGEE\nmutant shows a marked reorientation of the FMN-binding\ndomain relative to the FAD-binding domain in each of the three\nmolecules in the asymmetric unit (24). Molecule A has a rela-\ntively compact structure, but with the FMN-binding domain\nrotated relative to the FAD-binding domain so as to make the\nFMNmore solvent-accessible; however, residues 211\u2013222 and\nthe residues at the far end of the domain from the FMN remain\nsolvent-exposed, so molecule A cannot account for the NMR\nresults reported here. Molecules B and C have more extended\nconformations, and the electron density for the FMN-binding\ndomain is ill defined in both cases, suggesting a significant\ndegree of mobility. Complete coordinates are not available for\nthese less well orderedmolecules, but modeling (on the basis of\nthe incomplete coordinates and Fig. 1 in Ref. 24) suggests that\nboth are broadly similar to the extended conformations shown\nin Fig. 7. Aigrain et al. (29) have reported the structure of a\nchimeric enzyme consisting of the FMN-binding domain from\nyeast CPR with the hinge and the linker and FAD-binding\ndomains from human CPR. In this structure, the enzyme\nadopts a very extended conformation, with the FMN some 86\u00c5\naway from the FAD. This structure extends beyond the molec-\nular envelope derived from the SAXS data for human CPRox\nand yields a calculated Rg value of 35.2 \u00c5, which is significantly\ngreater than the 32 \u00c5 obtained for the extended conformation\nof human CPR from the EOM analysis (see above). This struc-\nture is therefore not consistent with the SAXS data reported\nhere for the human enzyme and in addition cannot account for\nour NMR data because the residues identified as showing\nchemical shift differences between the isolated FMN domain\nand intact CPR are solvent-exposed in the structure of the\nyeast-human chimeric CPR. Thus, although the exact domain\npositions in these two mutant CPR crystal structures cannot\naccount for the NMR and SAXS data for human wild-type CPR\npresented here, they do lend clear support to the idea that CPR\ncan exist in both compact and extended forms.\nIn conclusion, the combination of NMR and SAXS data pre-\nsented here provides clear evidence for amodel inwhichCPR in\nsolution can be described by a two-state conformational equi-\nlibrium. The SAXS data indicate that one conformation of the\nenzyme is compact and that the other is more extended.\nAlthough analysis of the SAXS data can of course provide only\nlow resolution pictures of these two conformations, the data are\nFIGURE 7. Typical structures of CPR obtained from the EOM analysis.\nStructures are shown for the extended and compact forms, and in the case of\nthe extended form, structures derived from the analysis of data from both\nCPRox and CPRhq are shown.

The extended conformation is\nas yet structurally less well defined, and experiments aimed at\nobtaining more detailed structural information are in progress.\nHowever, the NMR data indicate that a group of residues on\nand near the last helix of the FMN-binding domain must, in\nsome state of the protein, interact with the rest of the protein. A\nmodel of the extended conformation was generated based on\nthe NMR data, and a mixture of approximately equal amounts\nof this and the compact state is consistent with the SAXS data\nfor the oxidized enzyme. If the models of the extended confor-\nmation in Figs. 5C and 7 are reasonably accurate, it is possible to\nenvision a mechanism of domain reorganization wherein the\nFMN-binding domain slides or rolls across the surface of the\nlinker domain to form a new interface involving the surface of\nthe FMN-binding domain, including helices B (residues\n86\u2013102) and F (residues 212\u2013231); residues on the hinge itself;\nand surface charges such as Glu388, Arg403, and Asp442 on the\nlinker domain. This is shown in Fig. 8, which represents CPR on\nthe membrane as it would be when attached by its N-terminal\nhydrophobic sequence. The extended conformation appears to\nbe appropriate for electron transfer from FMN to electron\nacceptors such as cytochrome P450 because the FMN is readily\naccessible.\nThe observation that the effects of ligand binding on the\nequilibrium between the extended and compact forms of the\nenzyme correlate well with the effects on the rate of interflavin\nelectron transfer (22, 23, 48) strongly suggests that the extended\nform is physiologically relevant, and the observations with the\n\u0006TGEEmutant (24) indicate that the same is true for the phys-\niological electron transfer to cytochromes P450. Kinetic studies\n(23, 48) suggest that domain movement is rate-limiting for\ninterflavin electron transfer, and there is evidence that a similar\ndomain movement is rate-limiting in nitric-oxide synthase,\nanother member of the diflavin reductase family (Refs. 25\u201327\nand references therein). This indicates the crucial importance\nof this major structural change for the function of this enzyme.\nAcknowledgments\u2014We gratefully acknowledge the Science andTech-\nnology Facilities Council for awarding x-ray scattering beam time at\nthe Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source.
