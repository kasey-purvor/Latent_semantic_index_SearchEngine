A model of their phase interactions is obtained for the first time,\nthereby gaining new insights into the strength and direction of the cardiorespiratory phase coupling. The\nreconstructed model can reproduce synchronization phenomena between the cardiac and respiratory sys-\ntems, including switches in synchronization ratio. The technique is equally applicable to the extraction\nof the multi-dimensional couplings between many interacting subsystems.\n1 Introduction\nBiological oscillators are found at every level of complexity, and for almost every living system [1]. Os-\ncillations arise through the interaction of many dynamical degrees of freedom and processes with different\ntime scales [2]. Oscillatory signals from the human cardiovascular system (CVS) have been analysed over\nseveral decades because they appear to contain so much clinically relevant information. For diagnostic\npurposes, however, it seems still to be the case that only classical time-series analysis methods are being\napplied [3]. As each new technique of time-series analysis has emerged with the development of nonlinear\nand stochastic dynamics, it was challenged by application to CVS data and, in particular, to the analysis\nof cardio-respiratory interactions. Heart rate variability (HRV) has attracted particular attention, whereas\nrespiratory rate variability (RRV) has been less studied. Several additional oscillatory processes were also\nshown to be involved in cardiovascular interactions, e.g. the myogenic, neurogenic, and endothelial-related\nmetabolic activities [4]. The underlying dynamics is complex, nonlinear, time-varying, and subject to fluctu-\nations [5, 6, 7], so that no single time-series analysis method can be expected to reveal all relevant properties.\nIt must therefore be insufficient for diagnosis of many pathological states.\nBecause of the complexity, a parametric model of the cardiovascular system is essential. Once it has been\nconstructed, its parameters (e.g. amplitudes, phases and coupling coefficients) could characterise the state\nof the subject and thus be used both for earlier diagnosis of CVS disease and for assessing the efficacy of\ntreatment. Cardio-respiratory interactions have been modelled from first principles (see [8] and references\ntherein). Yet, because the system is so complex and present physiological knowledge is still insufficient\n[9], this group of models is of limited utility and often not realistic. Moreover, it was mainly amplitude\ndynamics that was considered. Because time-series data are now easily measured and widely available, the\ninverse approach based on recorded data seems more promising. However, very few techniques are available\nfor modelling nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. The recently introduced Bayesian inference technique\n[10, 11], or a Markov approach [12], may provide the solution to this as yet unsolved problem. The inference\ntechnique has already been applied to the amplitude dynamics of the cardio-respiratory interaction, whereas\n\u2217Corresponding author.\n\u2020A.

Biol. 2, 48-54 (2008).\nthe Markov approach has not yet been applied to the problem. Coupled oscillators interact both through their\namplitudes and phases. There is a crucial distinction between phase and amplitude investigations in that\nsmall perturbations have a huge impact on the phase, but only a very small effect on the amplitude. Analysis\nof phase dynamics has recently been used to reveal synchronization properties [13, 14, 15], nonlinearities\n[16], and the directionality of the inter-oscillator interactions [17, 18, 19]. Both HRV and RRV have so far\nbeen used only in synchronization or directionality analysis and no known modelling attempts have been\nmade to date.\nThe heart is the main pump in the CVS. The latter consists of a large network of vessels that can be\nregarded as resistances or conductances. The ultimate goal of the circulation is to supply all cells with O2\nand nutrients. So optimal control of the amount of blood, and thus of O2 and nutrients, is needed. This is\nperformed by controlling the cardiac frequency and the stroke volume, the amount of blood expelled by the\nheart in each cycle. The cardiac frequency and stroke volume adapt to variations in the conductance of the\nvascular network. In addition, the conductances are regulated by local mechanisms such as the endothelial,\nneurogenic and myogenic activities. The other generator in the network is the respiratory system, which\nnot only takes care of the O2 but also modulates the heart rate and stroke volume. The respiratory modu-\nlation of the heart rate has long been known as respiratory sinus arrythmia (RSA) [20, 21], while the other\nmechanisms are presently the subject of intensive research [7, 22, 23, 24].\nIn fact it is cardiac output, the product of heart rate and stroke volume, that is regulated. While the\nstroke volume is rather constant, the heart rate varies to take account of the needs of the body. It is also\nwell known that the respiratory frequency changes significantly when the system is perturbed, e.g. during\nan\u00e6sthesia [25], or in diabetes [24]. Frequency dynamics is therefore a powerful, objective and noninvasive\ntool to explore the dynamics of the system and can in principle improve our understanding of the physiology\nand the health of a subject.\nIn this paper we apply the theory of multidimensional Markovian processes to cardio-respiratory data for\nthe first time, analyse HRV and RRV data simultaneously, and model cardio-respiratory phase interactions.\nMathematical modelling of system dynamics is combined with the extraction of model parameters directly\nfrom measured time series. We analyzed recordings of cardiac and respiratory activity from healthy volun-\nteers in repose using, respectively, a 3-lead ECG system and piezoresistive sensor attached to a belt around\nthe thorax. The measurements were non-invasive and of length 30 minutes (10 subjects) or 80 minutes (8\nsubjects). The instantaneous frequencies of the cardiac and respiratory oscillations (HRV and RRV) were\nextracted using the marked events method [26]. For the first time, we reconstruct a model by simultaneous\nconsideration of the phase dynamics of the cardiac and respiratory oscillations.\n2 The mathematics of Markov processes\nThe theory of multidimensional Markovian processes [27] was applied to the data as follows. Consider the\ntwo-dimensional stochastic variable\nq(t) =\n(\nf\u02dch(t)\nf\u02dcr(t)\n)\n, (1)\nwhere f\u02dci(t) = fi(t)\u2212f\u00afi\u03c3i , i = h, r, fh and fr are the instantaneous heart (HRV) and respiratory (RRV)\nfrequencies, f\u00afh and f\u00afr are their averages, and \u03c3h and \u03c3r are the HRV and RRV variances. The stochastic\nprocess underlying the evolution of q during the time t is Markovian if the conditional probability density\nfunction (pdf) P (q(t1)|q(t2),q(t3), ...,q(tN )) with tN \u2264 tN\u22121 \u2264 ... \u2264 t1 for a certain time interval tM =\nt2 \u2212 t1, fulfills the relation P (q(t1) |q(t2),q(t3), ...,q(tN ) ) = P (q(t1) |q(t2) . For Markov processes,\n2\nthe evolution of the conditional pdf can be described by the Kramers-Moyal expansion which, by Pawula\u2019s\ntheorem, truncates after the second term if the fourth order expansion coefficient vanishes. In this case, the\nKramers-Moyal expansion reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation [27]. Alternatively, the stochastic process\nunderlying the evolution of q can be described by the Langevin equation for q(t):\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nqi(t) = fi(q, t) +\n2\u2211\nj=1\ngij(q, t)\u0393j(t) . (2)\nThe components of \u0393(t) represent the stochastic influences acting on the process. In this case, the func-\ntions f(q, t) and g(q, t) can be calculated from the drift vector D(1) and the diffusion matrix D(2). In\nStratanovich\u2019s stochastic calculus, f(q, t) and g(q, t) are given by\nfi(q, t) = D\n(1)\ni (q, t)\u2212 (\n\u221a\nD(2))kj\n\u2202\n\u2202qk\n(\n\u221a\nD(2))ij ,\ngij(q, t) = (\n\u221a\nD(2))ij , (3)\nwhere the drift vector D(1) and the diffusion matrix D(2) are defined as\nD\n(1)\ni (q, t) = lim\ntM\u21920\n1\ntM\n\u3008(q\u2032i(t\u2212 tM )\u2212 qi(t)) |q, t\u3009,\nD\n(2)\nij (q, t) = lim\ntM\u21920\n1\n2tM\n\u3008(q\u2032i(t\u2212 tM )\u2212 qi(t))\u00d7\n(q\u2032j(t\u2212 tM )\u2212 qj(t))|q, t\u3009. (4)\nHere \u3008\u00b7\u3009 are conditional expectation values that can easily be determined from experimental data. Moreover,\u221a\nD(2) is to be calculated by diagonalizing the matrix D(2), taking the square root of each element of the\ndiagonalized matrix and transforming the result back into the original system of coordinates. We have\nused a data analysis technique that yields estimates for drift and diffusion functions of Markov diffusion\nprocesses [28]. Accordingly, drift and diffusion functions are given in terms of truncated function series\nwith expansion parameters computed from experimental data. Note that the conditional averages D1 and\nD2 are not necessarily continuously differentiable functions with respect to t. Therefore, it is important\nto note that the derivatives correspond to derivatives from above. In this case, we have used a procedure\nwhich is discussed in detail in a paper by Frank et. al [28]. Accordingly, the phase space is decomposed\ninto bins. This decomposition of the phase space into bins suggests that we may usefully decompose D1\nand D2 in a similar way. After that, the drift and diffusion functions expressed as polynomials of f\u00afi. This\nstep-wise decomposition of drift and diffusion coefficients has been successfully applied in a number of\ncases [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. We comment, however, that this step-wise decomposition introduces an\ninaccuracy of O(\u2206fi,\u2206t) where \u2206fi is the resolution of fi and 1\/\u2206t is sampling frequency[28]. The\nLangevin equation offers an alternative way of checking the Markovian properties of a stochastic variable.\nThe idea [30] is to estimate the coefficients D(1) and D(2) from experimental data according to (4), and to\ncalculate f and g using (3); the Langevin equation (2) can then be used to extract \u0393(t) from the (measured)\nderivatives of the qi(t). If the realizations of the stochastic force obtained by this method are \u03b4-correlated\nwith zero mean and a Gaussian distribution, the Markov condition is fulfilled. We use this method here\nbecause, for multidimensional stochastic variables, it is hardly possible to check the Markov condition\ndirectly by means of multiconditional pdfs. Also the numerical cost for the estimation of the coefficients\nD(k) of order three and higher grows considerably with the order k (growth \u221d 2k).\n3\n3 Inferred Model\nWe now apply the above method to the fluctuations in HRV and RRV. Using (4) directly, we calculate\nthe drift and diffusion coefficients, D(1)i and D\n(2)\nij . We start with the HRV component of the drift vector.\nUsing experimental data, it will be shown that the dependence of D(1)h on f\u02dch can to a good approximation\nbe described by a straight line, as D(1)h = a + bf\u02dch. Although we have a first order dependence (with\nsmall scatter) for a with different values of f\u02dcr, the b-component of the drift vector shows a second-order\ndependence on the f\u02dcr (Fig. 1). The second-order coefficient D(2)hh is almost constant, for example in Fig. 2\nD\n(2)\nhh is shown as a function of f\u02dcr, which shows no clear functional dependence on f\u02dcr. Before we proceed\nwith the f\u02dcr-components of the drift vector and diffusion matrix, note that D(2)hr fluctuates approximately\naround zero (Fig. 2). We take this as evidence that the mixed coefficient D(2)hr vanishes. Given that these\noff-diagonal elements vanish, the functions g(f\u02dch, f\u02dcr) in (2) can easily be calculated according to equation\n(3) and g is then simply given by:\nghh =\n\u221a\nD\n(2)\nhh , ghr = grh = 0, grr =\n\u221a\nD\n(2)\nrr . (5)\nFrom the results obtained so far the Langevin-equation (2) for f\u02dcr takes the form:\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nf\u02dch(t) = D\n(1)\nh (f\u02dch, f\u02dcr) +\n\u221a\nD\n(2)\nhh \u0393h(t). (6)\nIt can already be used to extract the h\u2013component \u0393h(t) of the stochastic force from measured realizations\nof \u2202\n\u2202t\nf\u02dch(t), f\u02dch, and f\u02dcr(t). The stochastic process governing the t\u2013evolution of the stochastic variable q(t) is\nMarkovian, if the stochastic force \u0393 is \u03b4\u2013correlated. As can be seen in Fig. 3, the correlation function of the\nstochastic force \u0393h(t) fluctuates around zero, clearly indicating that the Markovian properties are fulfilled,\nin agreement with [35] which for healthy subjects the Markov length scale is less than 5 steps. To complete\nthe description by Markov analysis, we still have to determine the coefficients D(1)r and D(2)rr . D(1)r turns\nout to be a linear function of the f\u02dcr and does not depend explicitly on f\u02dch, and the coefficient D(2)rr turns out\nto be a second order function of just f\u02dcr. Hence\nD(1)r (f\u02dcr, f\u02dch) = D\n(1)\nr (f\u02dcr) = a\n\u2032 + b\u2032f\u02dcr\nD(2)rr (f\u02dcr, f\u02dch) = D\n(2)\nrr (f\u02dcr) = c+ df\u02dcr + ef\u02dc\n2\nr , (7)\nand for f\u02dcr the Langevin-equation (2) takes the form:\n\u2202\n\u2202t\nf\u02dcr(t) = D\n(1)\nr (f\u02dcr)\u2212\nd\ndf\u02dcr\n(D(2)rr (f\u02dcr)) +\n\u221a\nD\n(2)\nrr (f\u02dcr)\u0393r(t). (8)\nFor other data measured from different subjects, we expect the functional dependence of drift coeffi-\ncients and diffusion matrices to be the same, but with different numerical coefficients (cf. Table 1). The\ndynamics of D(1)h and D\n(2)\nhh is as shown in Fig. 4, and the average values can be seen to be close to those in\nTable. 1 obtained from the whole signals. The functionality of the coefficients obtained indicates that the\nfrequency of respiration influences the cardiac frequency strongly, whereas the influence is very small in the\nopposite direction, consistent with the results of methods specifically developed for detecting the coupling\ndirectionality of interacting phases [18, 19], and with direct physiological observations.\nTable 1 shows that the values of the drift and diffusion coefficients vary considerably from one\nsubject to another. One possible explanation is that we have a wide range of ages (from 22 to 72 yr) and\nthat the drift and diffusion coefficients are age-dependent. Moreover, although, we have divided all the\nsignals by their variances, there is still a large inter-subject variability which is probably attributable\n4\nSubject D(1)h (f\u02dch, f\u02dcr) D(2)hh (f\u02dch, f\u02dcr)\n1 0.16-0.01f\u02dcr-(0.32-0.04f\u02dcr+0.69f\u02dc2r )f\u02dch 0.15\n2 -0.06-0.09f\u02dcr-(0.39-0.01f\u02dcr+0.27f\u02dc2r )f\u02dch 0.21\n3 -0.04+0.01f\u02dcr-(0.27-0.19f\u02dcr+0.25f\u02dc2r )f\u02dch 0.16-0.04f\u02dcr\n4 0.01 -0.03f\u02dcr-(0.06-0.02f\u02dcr+0.09f\u02dc2r )f\u02dch 0.02\n5 -0.01 -0.03f\u02dcr-(0.20-0.12f\u02dcr+0.17f\u02dc2r )f\u02dch 0.15\nSubject D(1)r (f\u02dcr) D(2)rr (f\u02dcr)\n1 -0.02-0.74f\u02dcr 0.09+0.06f\u02dcr+0.43f\u02dc2r\n2 -0.01-0.45f\u02dcr 0.21+0.05f\u02dcr+0.17f\u02dc2r\n3 -0.10-0.71f\u02dcr 0.28+0.37f\u02dcr+0.46f\u02dc2r\n4 -0.05 -0.71f\u02dcr 0.27+0.12f\u02dcr+0.36f\u02dc2r\n5 -0.05-0.82f\u02dcr 0.18-0.05f\u02dcr+0.47f\u02dc2r\nTable 1: The drift coefficients and diagonal components of the diffusion Matrix for 5 out of 18 subjects (the\nfirst 3 are 30 minute and the rest are 80 minute).\nto from the differing natures and histories of the subjects. Nevertheless, for all subjects the drift and\ndiffusion coefficients for respiration, as well as the diffusion coefficients for heart, do not vary by very\nmuch. The situation is more complicated in the case of the drift coefficient of the heart. This may\nsuggest that the heart interacts with many more sources of variability than just with respiration.\n4 Validation - synchronization analysis\nWe now have two equations related to HRV and RRV. To check the accuracy of estimation we have analyzed\nand compared the synchronization behavior of the original and reconstructed pairs of signals. The results\nare shown in Fig. 5 and 6. In Fig. 5 the reconstructed signals related to HRV and RRV have been plotted\nversus the original (labelled as \u201cReal\u201d in the figures) signals.\nClassically, synchronization of two periodic nonidentical oscillators is understood as an adjustment of\ntheir rhythms, or locking of their phases, \u03c6n,m = n\u03c61 \u2212 m\u03c62 = const, where \u03c61 and \u03c62 are phases,\nn and m are integers, and \u03c6n,m is the generalized phase difference, or relative phase. For noisy, chaotic\nsystems and\/or systems with modulated natural frequencies a weaker condition of phase synchronization,\n|\u03c6n,m| = |n\u03c61\u2212m\u03c62\u2212 \u03b4| < const, where \u03b4 is some (average) phase shift, was introduced [36, 37, 38, 39].\nAccordingly, synchronization is then understood as the appearance of peaks in the distribution of cyclic\nrelative phase \u03c8n,m = \u03c6n,m mod 2pi and interpreted as the existence of a preferred stable value of phase\ndifference between two oscillators. In such a case, the n:m phase locking is manifested as a time variation\nof \u03c8n,m around a horizontal plateau.\nIn analyzing synchronization, the integers n and m should both be determined. In the case of two\ninteracting noisy oscillatory processes, n and m change in time. One possibility, known as the phase stro-\nboscope, or synchrogram, is to fix the value of m and observe changes of n in time [40]. Accordingly,\nthe cardiorespiratory synchrogram is constructed by plotting the normalized relative phase of a heartbeat\nwithin m respiratory cycles, \u03a8m = 12pi (\u03c62(tk) mod 2pim), where tk is the time of kth heartbeat and \u03c62 is\nthe instantaneous phase of respiration. We calculated the normalized relative phase, \u03a8m, directly from the\nmeasured data, exploiting the fact that both signals contain sharp peaks that clearly mark the instantaneous\ncycles. Each successive peak was marked as an equivalence of one oscillatory cycle, corresponding to which\na 2pi increment was added. The instantaneous phase is then\n\u03c6(t) = 2pi\nt\u2212 tk\ntk + 1\u2212 tk + 2pik, tk \u2264 t < tk+1, (9)\n5\nwhere tk is time of kth marker event. Defined in this way the phase is a monotonically increasing piecewise-\nlinear function of time defined on the real line. Usually, the first step in searching an n:m locking is look for\nhorizontal plateaus in \u03a8m, revealing the value of n in cases when synchronization exists. The distribution\nof \u03a8n,m is then a \u03b4 function, smeared in the presence of noise. For strongly nonlinear oscillators it can be\nnonuniform even in the absence of noise [41]. To characterize the strength of synchronization we therefore\nneed a robust quantitative measure. Since in noisy systems phase synchronization can be understood in a\nstatistical sense as the existence of preferred values of the generalized phase difference, measures based on\nquantifying the distribution of phases\n\u03b7 = \u03c62 mod 2pin|\u03c61 mod 2pim (10)\nwere proposed. We will use an index based on conditional probability which was introduced in [39] and\nwas shown to facilitate reliable detection of synchronous epochs of different order n:m [42]. Accordingly,\nthe phase of the second oscillator is observed at fixed values of the phase of the first oscillator, \u03b8. The\ninterval of each phase \u03c61 and \u03c62, [0, 2pim) and [0, 2pin), respectively, is divided into N bins. The values of\n\u03c61 mod 2pim that belong to bin l are denoted as \u03b8l , while the number of points inside this bin is denoted as\nMl , and, by using Eq. (10), Ml values of \u03b7j,l, j = 1, ...,Ml , are calculated. If there is no synchronization\nbetween the oscillators, a uniform distribution of \u03b7j,l can be expected on the interval [0, 2pin), or else it\nclusters around a certain value resulting in a unimodal distribution. Hence, the distribution is quantified as\nrl(tk) =\n1\nMl\nMl(tk)\u2211\nj=1\nei\u03c62(tj) (11)\nfor each j when \u03c61(tj) belongs to the lth bin and tk\u2212tp\/2 \u2264 tj < tk+tp\/2. Ml(tk) is the number of points\nin this bin at the kth instant. An average over \u223c8 periods, tp, of the slower oscillator was used. Where the\nphases are completely locked, or completely unlocked we obtain |rl(tk)| = 1 or |rl(tk)| = 0, respectively.\nTo improve reliability, we also calculate the average over all bins and obtain the index of synchronization\n\u03bbn,m(tk) =\n1\nN\n\u2211N\nl=1 |rl(tk)|.\nAccordingly, \u03bbn,m is a measure of the conditional probability that \u03c62 has a certain value within the lth\nbin when \u03c61 belongs to this bin. Synchronization can occur in several regimes, switching from one index to\nanother with time. The indices used must be found by trial and error, although a good indication of where the\nregimes occur can be obtained from the frequency ratio of the two oscillators. A frequency ratio of f1\nf2\n= 4\nwould suggestm:n indices of 1:4. As we mentioned before, perfect synchronization appears when the value\nof the index = 1, and is zero when there is no synchronization. However, in a noisy system such as the\nCVS, perfect synchronization is rarely seen. Hence a high index value close to 1 is used as an indication of\nsynchronization. For the present investigation, values above 0.9 were taken to validate evidence of possible\nsynchronization seen in the synchrograms.\nAlso, there is the problem of apparent synchronization that occurs by pure coincidence. As a test,\nshuffled data was created from pairs of HRV and RRV signals, as well as from the reconstructed ones: in the\nshuffling process, these data were randomized in such a way that no real synchronization could exist. It was\nfound that short epochs above the threshold did indeed occur occasionally, but that they lasted no more than\n\u223c25 seconds in length, as illustrated in Figs. 6(B)and (D). Hence, only epochs exceeding 25 seconds were\nconsidered as representing true synchronization. Using these two criteria it was possible to give a picture of\nlikely synchronization regimes. The synchronization indices show that, instead of there being long episodes\nof n:m synchronization with constant n and m, the cardiorespiratory interaction switches in time between\nseveral close ratios. This switching could either be representative of the onset of chaos or just an indication\nthat there are other oscillatory components on slower time scales that perturb the pattern of synchronization\nalmost periodically.\n6\nFig. 6 shows that these results demonstrate convincingly that the nonlinear Langevin equations derived\nfrom experimental data provide a valid description of cardiorespiratory dynamics. These results reveal an-\nother important aspect of applying a Markov approach to the cardiorespiratory interaction. Fig. 6 illustrates\ntransitions between the 2:11 and 1:5 synchronization states. They are thought to arise from interactions\nbetween the different oscillatory components in the cardiorespiratory signals. Fig. 6 shows the correctness\nof this idea. Synchronization episodes derived from two Langevin equations show almost the same transi-\ntions between synchronization states. The small differences between the original and reconstructed graph\nmay be related to the effect of other oscillatory components, e.g. the myogenic, neurogenic, or endothelial-\nrelated metabolic activities [7], which have not been considered here. We also comment that, to make a\nprediction for the future of the signal we could select a few (say 3) consecutive points in the exper-\nimental series and search for the three consecutive points in the reconstructed series, derived from\nLangevin equations, that differ least from the selected points. Note that the better the estimations of\ndrift and diffusion and the longer the time series (better statistics), the better and more complete the\nreconstruction that can be expected. If the process were exactly Markovian then we could use these\nLangevin equations to predict any quantity involved in the problem. In reality, of course, all of the\ndiscussion relates to Markovianicity within some range of accuracy.\n5 Discussion and conclusion\nLike the Bayesian inference method [10], the Markovian approach can in principle be applied to any signals,\nincluding multi-dimensional ones arising from complex interactions between many subsystems. The two\nmethods differ radically, however, in that the former is an analytical extension of the generalized least\nsquares method, whereas the latter is based on the analytical information of the Markov processes. The\nmethod proposed here is in some ways similar to that discussed in the paper by Frank et all [28] which\ndescribes model identification from trajectory measurements in nonlinear stochastic equation with state-\ndependent (multiplicative) white noise. The drift h(x) and diffusion D(x) coefficients as functions of a\nstate variable x (D(1)i (fh, fr) andD(2)ij (fh, fr) in the present paper) are obtained using definitions following\nfrom the Fokker Planck equation, i.e. as conditional averages involving first and second moments of the\nsystem trajectory displacement from the point x during an infinitesimal time interval. The method presented\nin the paper by Frank et al gives asymptotically correct values for h(x) and D(x) in the limit of an infinitely\nlarge number of measurements, but it may not provide a very accurate statistical analysis of the problem for\na limited .\nWhere the number of observations is relatively small, certain regions of the state variable x (correspond-\ning to the tails of the probability distribution of x in the dynamical problem) may contain only a few data\npoints. In such cases, discretization with a constant bin size is not the optimal approach. Correct analysis\nrequires one to choose a bin size adaptively for different regions of x, depending on the particular obser-\nvations, with wider bins where there are fewer dat points. Alternatively, it is possible to completely avoid\nbinning of the configuration space by introduction of a posterior distribution of model parameters condi-\ntioned on the measured trajectory points. This approach, introduced in a recent paper by Smelyanskiy et al\n[10], is based on a path integral representation of the stochastic process and a functional series expansion of\nthe empirically chosen basis functions in the dynamical model. As mentioned above this approach avoids\nbinning of the measured trajectory points and computes directly a posterior distribution of the unknown\nmodel parameters with computational complexity equal to that in Frank et al. On the other hand, it may\nnot always be easy to guess a priori which type of the model and how many different basis functions will\nbe appropriate. Nevertheless, with suitable initial, inference method should gives accurate results even for\nshort time series.\n7\nIn summary, the model reconstructed by the Markovian approach reproduces the coupling direction-\nality, strength, and phase dynamics of the cardiac and respiratory oscillations and their interactions. The\nfundamental time scale in the approach is the Markov time scale, which is the minimum time interval\nover which the series can be considered as constituting a Markov process. Based on the estimates of\nthe Kramers- Moyal coefficients for the series, it was shown that the fourth-order coefficient is very\nsmall, implying that the Kramers-Moyal expansion reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation which, in\nturn, is equivalent to a Langevin equation. Thus, the probability densities of the fluctuations satisfy a\nFokker-Planck equation. It is characterized by drift and diffusion coefficients, representing the first\ntwo coefficients in the Kramers-Moyal expansion. We computed accurate approximants for the coef-\nficients of the stochastic time series by using the polynomial ansatz. We then constructed two simple\nLangevin equations governing the time series. The resulting equations are capable of providing a ra-\ntional explanation for complex features of the series. Moreover, it requires no scaling feature. Our\napproach also reveals in detail the statistical properties of the data, which can help one to check the\nbiological modelling rather precisely.\n6 Acknowledgment\nThe authors would like to thank V.
