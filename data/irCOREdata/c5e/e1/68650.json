INTRODUCTION\nIt has long been known that cardiorhythm is influenced by\nrespiration, a phenomenon called respiratory sinus arrhyth-\nmia ~RSA! @1\u20134#. RSA is a modulation of the heart rate\nresulting from interaction between the processes of respira-\ntion and heart rhythm generation. This interaction can some-\ntimes cause the related but different phenomenon of synchro-\nnization @5\u20139#. Cardiorespiratory synchronization ~CRS!\nmanifests itself through entrainment between heart and res-\npiration rates @10\u201313#, and has been shown to be useful for\nmedical diagnostics in humans @14# and in rats @15#.\nRSA has been widely studied, both in freely breathing\nsubjects, and in subjects performing paced respiration where\nbreathing is synchronized with some external signal @16,17#.\nPaced respiration is now a well-established tool for relax-\nation and for the treatment of chronic pain and insomnia,\ndental and facial pain, etc. @18\u201320#. Modulation of heart rate\ndue to paced respiration was systematically studied in Refs.\n@21,22#: in Ref. @21# three values of respiration frequency,\nand in Ref. @22#, the frequency range between 0.083 Hz to\n0.2 Hz, were examined. CRS has been detected in subjects\nundergoing paced respiration @23# and the cardiorespiratory\ninteraction has been used as a diagnostic tool @24#. In clinical\npractice, and occasionally in everyday life, the need can arise\nto control the heart rate without involving invasive or com-\nplex techniques. It is known that a change of respiration\nparameters can lead, not only to modulation of the heart rate,\nbut also to a shift in its average value. In this context paced\nrespiration would appear to be a promising technique for the\ncontrol of heart rate. However, there have been no systematic\nstudies of the synchronization of heart rate by paced respira-\ntion, and a number of important questions remain open. For\nexample, it is important to know whether CRS is stable un-\nder variation of the frequency of paced respiration. Does this\nphenomenon occur randomly, or are there ranges of paced\nrespiration frequency when synchronization is to be expected\nwith a larger probability, in spite of noise and nonstationar-\nity? What types of n:m synchronization appear most fre-\nquently during paced respiration? The present work is an\nattempt to answer these questions.\nFrom the viewpoint of oscillation theory, the cardiovascu-\nlar system ~CVS! can be treated as a self-sustained oscillator\nwhose basic frequency is the average heart rate, and where\nrespiration can be regarded as an external forcing. According\nto theory, the average frequency of self-oscillation can1063-651X\/2002\/66~5!\/051909~9!\/$20.00 66 0519change whenever external forcing is applied, regardless of\nwhether or not synchronization takes place. However, syn-\nchronization preserves a constant ratio between the forcing\nand response frequencies while either the forcing or the sys-\ntem parameters are varied. Thus, to predict the effect of forc-\ning, one needs to know in detail how the CVS responds to a\nchange in the parameters of forcing, the latter being paced\nrespiration. In mathematical terms, one needs a bifurcation\ndiagram ~map of regimes! in a plane of the control param-\neters, for example, the respiration-amplitude versus\nrespiration-frequency plane, delineating the synchronous and\nasynchronous regimes for every individual. This is an ideal-\nized and ambitious goal which will not be addressed here in\nview of the unavoidable restrictions imposed on the study of\nany living system. The more modest aim of the present work\nis to reveal a one-dimensional cut of the complete map of\nregimes defined by the frequency of paced respiration. Even\na rough picture of this kind, showing the transitions through\ndifferent synchronous and asynchronous regimes as just one\ncontrol parameter is increased, can provide some indication\nof the global structure.\nIn contrast to experiments with, e.g., electronic oscilla-\ntors, the parameters of a living system cannot be kept con-\nstant but continuously vary. The CVS is influenced by a huge\nnumber of factors that change in time. Such changes cannot\nbe eliminated, even when the subject is fully relaxed, but\nconstitute unavoidable manifestations of noise and nonsta-\ntionarity. In this situation, even the existence of synchroni-\nzation that is stable under variation of forcing parameters\nbecomes questionable.\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II basic\ndefinitions are given and assumptions about the system under\nstudy are formulated, allowing the problem to be considered\nin terms of oscillation theory. Section III describes experi-\nments. Section IV describes the techniques used for data pro-\ncessing. The results obtained are given in Sec. V. Section VI\ncontains a discussion and Section VII some conclusions.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nSynchronization between two or more interacting oscilla-\ntory systems is a fundamental phenomenon @5\u20139#. For two\ninteracting, self-sustained ~dissipative, nonlinear!, systems it\nmanifests itself as an adjustment of their basic frequencies\nf 1 , f 2 so as to satisfy the relation n f 15m f 2, where n and m\nare integers. Synchronization with the given values of n and\u00a92002 The American Physical Society09-1\nRZECZINSKI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 66, 051909 ~2002!m is called \u2018\u2018n:m synchronization.\u2019\u2019 Another manifestation of\nsynchronization is adjustment of the phases w1(t) and w2(t)\nof the interacting systems so as to satisfy\nuunw1~ t !2mw2~ t !u2Cu,e , ~1!\nwhere t is ~continuous! time, C is some constant and e\n,2p . Synchronization can occur either when the two sys-\ntems mutually influence each other ~bidirectional coupling!,\nor when one system forces the other without feedback ~uni-\ndirectional coupling!. According to the theory of synchroni-\nzation of periodic @25# ~and even chaotic! oscillations, syn-\nchronization occurs when certain conditions on both the\nfrequency and amplitude of forcing are satisfied. Let the ba-\nsic frequency of unforced oscillations in the system be f 0,\nthe amplitude and frequency of forcing be A and f f , respec-\ntively, and the basic frequency of forced oscillations be f.\nThe quantity D f 5( f f \/ f 0)2(n\/m) is the frequency detuning\nbetween the system and the forcing, and f f \/ f 0 is their fre-\nquency ratio. Then, the larger D f is, the larger the A that is\nneeded to synchronize the system. For a periodic system\nforced periodically, a common structure for the n:m synchro-\nnization regimes in the \u2018\u2018forcing amplitude\u2019\u2019\u2014\u2018\u2018frequency\nratio\u2019\u2019 parameter plane, for relatively small values of A, is\nshown in Fig. 1 @25#. Synchronization regions have the shape\nof horns. They are now commonly referred to as Arnol\u2019d\ntongues. Each tongue begins with a point on the abscissa axis\nwhich is equal to the corresponding n:m value. For weak\nforcing, the larger the value of m, the narrower is the syn-\nchronization tongue, at least for m.4 @26#. For weak forcing\nthe transition from an asynchronous to a synchronous regime\nis associated with the transition from an ergodic to a resonant\ntorus in the phase space. If m,4, the synchronization is\ncalled a \u2018\u2018strong resonance,\u2019\u2019 and if m>4 the resonance is\ncalled \u2018\u2018weak.\u2019\u2019 A very important feature of the synchroniza-\ntion phenomenon is its robustness: that is, if one is inside the\nsynchronization tongue, a small variation of D f and ~or! or A\nshould not lead to disappearance of the effect. A qualitatively\nsimilar picture of synchronization regions was also observed\nfor chaotic @27# and even for stochastic @28# oscillations.\nIf the interacting systems are periodic and subject to noise\n@29#, or chaotic ~maybe, also with noise! @30#, Eq. ~1! can\nonly remain satisfied during finite time intervals. In this case,\nthere is no strict definition of either synchronization or syn-\nchronization regions. Whether or not to treat an observed\nFIG. 1.

The dashed line shows the kind of one-dimensional cut\nthrough this map of regimes that was sought in the experiments.05190regime as synchronous depends solely on the judgement of\nthe observer. Usually, a regime is considered to be synchro-\nnous when the duration of the plateau defined by Eq. ~1!\nexceeds some predefined number of basic oscillation periods.\nSynchronization persisting only during a finite time interval\nis known as effective synchronization @31#. Following this\nnotation, we will hereinafter refer to the average relative du-\nration of synchronization epochs as the effectiveness of the\nsynchronization, for brevity.\nIt is known that an isolated heart can continue to contract\nrhythmically for a long time at a very stable frequency, that\nis, it behaves as a self-sustained oscillator. It is also known\nthat respiration affects heart rate much more strongly than\nthe heart activity affects respiration @32#. Thus, as a good\napproximation, one can assume that respiration forces heart\nrate in a unidirectional manner. This forcing can be easily\nbrought very close to being periodic through paced respira-\ntion. With these assumptions, we can treat the CVS of a\nhuman undergoing paced respiration as a generator under\nperiodic forcing, affected by noise and nonstationarity. Syn-\nchronization theory should therefore be applicable.\nWe change the frequency of paced respiration gradually\nbetween the feasible extreme frequencies of 0.05\u20130.5 Hz. It\nis known ~ @32#, and references therein! that normally, the\nsmaller the breathing frequency, the larger its amplitude,\nsince the average volume of air required to go through the\nsystem per unit time is roughly the same. We aim to establish\nwhether n:m synchronization between respiration and heart\nrate took place for the given respiration frequency by com-\nparing the forcing and response signals. In this way, we aim\nto plot a one-dimensional cut of the map of regimes along\nthe curve formed by the current values of forcing amplitude,\nsketched in Fig. 1 as a dashed line.\nIII. DESCRIPTION OF MEASUREMENTS\nSix volunteers participated in the measurements. They\nwere young men aged 22\u201329 years, non-smokers, without\nany history of cardiopulmonary disease. The sessions were\nperformed 3\u20134 h after the last meal, and no caffeinated bev-\nerage was taken on the day of the experiment.\nEach subject was asked to lie on a bed in a comfortable\nposition, with his head on a pillow, slightly tilted. An interval\nof about 20 min followed in order to achieve full relaxation.\nValues of heart rate were measured and compared several\ntimes during this period, to establish that relaxation had\ntaken place. A signal with which to synchronize respiration\nwas generated by computer and presented to the subject as a\nseries of light and sound pulses of duration 0.1 sec as de-\nscribed in Ref. @33#: he was able to see a red square on the\ncomputer screen and hear the sound. He was asked to inhale\nwhen the sound and light signal appeared, and to exhale at\nhis convenience before being prompted to inhale again by\nthe next signal. We did not impose any restrictions on the\namplitude of breathing, and suggested to subjects that they\nshould breathe to whatever depth felt most comfortable for\nthe given frequency.\nAfter about 20 sec, the subject was breathing as pre-\nscribed by the generated signal and had become accustomed9-2\nREGIONS OF CARDIORESPIRATORY . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 66, 051909 ~2002!to the regime being imposed. Simultaneous measurements of\nthe ECG and the respiration signals were then initiated, and\ncontinued for 180 sec. The respiration signal was measured\nusing a respiratory effort transducer by Biopac Systems Inc.,\nand the ECG signal by positioning three electrodes on the\nright and left shoulder and on the last rib on the subject\u2019s left.\nFor each new measurement, the respiration frequency f resp\nwas increased by 1 breath per min ~i.e., by 1 min21). The\nminimal and maximal respiration frequencies were selected\nexperimentally to be 3 and 30 min21, respectively, so that\nthey should not be too difficult for the subject. Thus, 28\ndataset pairs were measured for each subject. In between\nmeasurements the subject was allowed to relax for about 5\nmin until his heart rate, averaged over 1 min, had stopped\nchanging. The average heart rate at rest was recorded to pro-\nvide the current value of f 0 before each new measurement.\nThe measurements for each subject were completed in a\nsingle continuous session ~except for subject 2! lasting for\nabout 4 h in total. This procedure was adopted because, to\nplot a map of regimes, we were interested in ensuring that\nthe experimental conditions ~weather, room temperature,\ntime of the day, etc.! and the physical and mental state of the\nsubject, remained as constant as possible. The relatively\nlarge number of datapoints needed to create the map of re-\ngimes, and the necessity of completing the measurements for\na given subject in one session, imposed restrictions on the\ntime per measurement. On the one hand, the time of one\nmeasurement should not be too short. In practice, however,\nour preliminary experiments have shown that a session can-\nnot reasonably exceed 3\u20134 h, because a longer time is ex-\nhausting for the volunteer. Compromise was obviously nec-\nessary, and 3 min was selected as being the optimal time per\nmeasurement.\nFor any given subject, the respiratory effort transducer\nand ECG electrodes were positioned once at the beginning of\nthe measurements, and not adjusted subsequently during the\nrest of the session. We can therefore make meaningful com-\nparisons between the relative amplitudes of respiration\nthroughout the whole session for that particular subject.\nFor two of the six subjects we repeated the measurements\nseveral days after the first session. This was done in order to\nlearn whether the effect of cardiorespiratory synchronization\ncan easily be reproduced when the experimental conditions\nand the state of the subject ~mood, food taken, previous ac-\ntivities, etc.! would all have been slightly different.\nThe first session with subject 2 was an exception, how-\never: it was split into two parts. Measurements for respira-\ntion frequencies f resp of 3\u201315 min21 inclusive were com-\npleted on the first day, and those for f resp of 16\u201330 min21\ninclusive were done on the next day.\nIV. DATA PROCESSING TECHNIQUES\nThe ultimate goal of our study was to plot a curve split\ninto segments of nonsynchronized and n:m synchronized ac-\ntivity on the plane of the two control parameters f resp \/ f 0 and\nA resp ~see Fig. 1 for a sketch of the curve!, where A resp and\nf resp are the amplitude and frequency of paced respiration,\nrespectively. Following the representation in Fig. 1, we chose05190to normalize the respiration frequency f resp to the average\nheart rate before measurement f 0, for two reasons. First, the\naverage heart rate in relaxation differs between subjects, im-\nplying that the same respiration frequency can lead to differ-\nent synchronization orders in them. Normalization allows us\nto compare the synchronization regions of different subjects.\nSecond, the average heart rate changes slightly in the course\nof experiments, in spite of all precautions, so that f 0 will not\nbe quite constant in a given subject before different measure-\nments within the same session.\nThe ratio of the two numbers f resp and f 0 is readily com-\nputed to find the coordinate on the horizontal axis. The co-\nordinate A resp on the vertical axis is the amplitude of the\nrespiration signal. Strictly speaking, its amplitude was not\nconstant from one breath to the next. By amplitude we there-\nfore mean an average amplitude. We define A resp as the\nsquare root of the signal power, assessed by integration over\nits Fourier power spectrum. A one-dimensional cut of the\nmap of regimes is thus straightforward to plot.\nThe next step is to split this curve into segments corre-\nsponding to synchronized and nonsynchronized regimes. The\nabsence or presence of n:m phase synchronization is de-\ntected by introducing phases for both respiration and ECG\nand computing the phase difference\nDw~ t !5\nn\nm\nwecg~ t !2w resp~ t !. ~2!\nIn order to establish the values of n and m, we first find a\nrough approximation of the synchronization order n:m by\ncomputing the Fourier spectra of the respiration and ECG\nsignals and finding the ratio of their basic frequencies j\n5 f resp \/ f ecg . After that we try several values of n which,\nbeing multiplied by j will be close to some integer value m.\nIn doing so, we try to find n and m values that are not larger\nthan 15 because, according to the theory, the larger the de-\nnominator of the synchronization order, the narrower is the\nsynchronization tongue. In the presence of noise ~which is\ninevitable in real systems! these tongues will be smeared.\nFurthermore, the relatively rough sampling provided by our\n28-point curve made it quite improbable that points would\nfall within the narrow tongues.\nThe presence of n:m synchronization was arbitrarily de-\nfined by the condition that\nuDw~ t !2Cu,\np\nm\n, ~3!\nduring 5 periods of respiration, or longer. In practice, how-\never, for all respiration frequencies larger than 0.25 Hz\n(15 min21) we seek for plateaus lasting 20 sec or longer.\nThere may be several such plateaus during the same mea-\nsurement. If at least one plateau of sufficient duration is de-\ntected, we attribute that measurement to the corresponding\nn:m synchronization region.\nSometimes ~but rarely! during the same measurement\nswitchings between synchronization regimes of different or-\nders n:m occur. We then attribute the same measurement to\ntwo different synchronization tongues. Where several succes-\nsive values of respiration frequency lead to the same syn-9-3\nRZECZINSKI et al. PHYSICAL REVIEW E 66, 051909 ~2002!chronization order n:m , they form the required segment of\nthe curve belonging to the same tongue.\nThere are several different ways for introducing phases\nfrom one-dimensional signals @34#. One way is to store all\ntime moments t i when the signal x(t) crosses some threshold\nlevel u in one direction ~e.g., from above to below! and then\nattribute to each such crossing a phase increase of 2p . An\nillustration of this technique is given in Fig. 2, where an\nECG of one of our healthy volunteers @Fig. 2~a!# is given\ntogether with his simultaneously measured respiration signal\n@Fig. 2~b!#. For the ECG, following the usual convention, we\ncount only intersections of the so-called R peak @the highest\nand narrowest peak, negative going as plotted in Fig. 2~b!#\nwith the threshold. If threshold levels are crossed at the time\nmoments t i\necg and t i\nresp\n, the phases for ECG and respiration\nare defined as follows:\nwecg~ t !52p\nt2t i\necg\nt i11\necg 2t i\necg 12pi , tP]t i\necg ;t i11\necg ]\nw resp~ t !52p\nt2t i\nresp\nt i11\nresp 2t i\nresp 12pi , tP]t i\nresp ;t i11\nresp ], ~4!\nwhere i is the number of the crossing.\nAnother method is to reconstruct the phase portrait from a\nsignal, project it onto the phase plane and introduce phase as\na phase angle on this plane. For the reconstruction of the\nphase plane one can use various methods, including the Hil-\nbert transform @7# and delay embedding @35#. Delay embed-\nding is easier to implement and requires much less compu-\ntation time and resources than the Hilbert transform. It is\nknown that for an ~almost! periodic signal, the optimal time\ndelay t is equal to a quarter of a period. In Fig. 3, delay\nFIG. 2.

RESULTS\nIn Fig. 4 values of R-R intervals are given for all sessions\nof measurements for all six subjects. The horizontal axis is\nsplit by vertical lines into segments of duration 180 sec, be-\ning the duration of one measurement. R-R intervals within\nseparate neighboring measurement are also marked by differ-\nent shades to help to distinguish between them. The integers\nbeneath segments mark the frequency of paced respiration in\nbreaths per minute. In the first plot for subject 2 one can see\na discontinuity between the measurements for respiration fre-\nquencies 15 and 16 min21. This was due to the break of 1\nday between these measurements. All other sets of measure-\nments were done in single sessions, and there are no abrupt\njumps in the series of R-R intervals between successive mea-\nsurements.\nBy average heart rate we will mean the reciprocal of the\naverage R-R interval during the time of one measurement.\nFigure 5 plots ~a! the average values and ~b! the variance of\nthe R-R intervals shown in Fig. 4, as functions of the respi-\nration frequency.

The\ndashed line connects the positions of the measurement points\nmarked by circles @which for complete measurements are the\nsame as those shown in Fig. 6~b!#. Empty circles indicate the\nabsence of any synchronization, while filled circles mark\nsynchronous regimes.\nFrom the theory we know that a synchronization region\nshould grow from a point (n:m) at zero forcing amplitude,\nand as the latter increases, their widths should increase, too.\nWe have no precise information about how the boundaries of\nthe synchronization regions evolve. We only know that, for\nvery small forcing amplitude, they are straight lines rising\nfrom the horizontal axis. To estimate roughly the limits of\neach synchronization region, we connect the theoretical start-\ning point (n:m) on the horizontal axis with the bounding\npoints of the same region on the experimental curve. The\nexperimental synchronization tongues, estimated in this way,\nare shown as the shaded regions in Fig. 8.\nTo estimate the effectiveness ~see Sec.

The verti-\ncal axis indicates the relative durations of plateaus for the\nmost frequently encountered orders of synchronization n:m ,\naveraged over all subjects and all measurements in which\nthis synchronization occurs. The numbers over the datapoints\ngive the number of subjects who demonstrated this particular\nsynchronization regime.\nFinally, we estimate the robustness of synchronization.\nWe compute the tongue width as the difference of frequency\nratios D( f resp \/ f 0) at its boundaries, for each of the com-\nmoner synchronization orders. If the tongue consists of only\none point, we define its width as the step in respiration fre-\nquency, 1 min21, divided by the average heart rate prior to\npaced respiration f 0. Note, that this is not the tongue width at\nthe same level of respiration amplitude. This estimate reflects\nthe width of synchronization region along the cut of the pa-\nrameter plane at the current value of frequency, which, in\nturn, defines the optimal amplitude. Figure 10~b! gives the\nvalues of tongue width for the commoner synchronization\norders, averaged over all subjects.\nVI. DISCUSSION\nOur observation that heart rate variability, as expressed\nthrough the variance of R-R intervals, decreases as the res-\npiration frequency increases ~Figs. 4,5! is in a good agree-\nment with earlier observations @1,17#. The fact that the larger\nthe frequency of paced respiration, the smaller on average its\namplitude becomes ~Fig. 6!, accords with common sense\n~because of the need to maintain a particular oxygenation\nlevel! and is consistent with earlier experiments @32#.\nThe experimental maps of regimes in Fig. 8 are to be\ncompared with the theoretical one in Fig. 1. The qualitative\nstructure of the theoretical Arnold tongues is reproduced in\nour experiments, notwithstanding the inevitable real-life cir-\ncumstances affecting the possibility of synchronization. This\nallows us to infer that the system governing the heart rate of\na healthy human can be treated as a generator in a physical\nsense, and that paced respiration acts as an external periodic\nforcing of this system. However, the widths of the synchro-\nnization tongues do not seem to be as predicted by the theory\nof a periodic oscillator forced periodically @Fig. 10~b!#. In\nparticular, the synchronization regions found do not exhibit\nan obvious decrease of the tongue width with the increase of\ndenominator m of synchronization order n:m . It is not obvi-\nous what rule, if any, governs the width of the tongue. Such\na rule may perhaps be hidden because the actual strength\nwith which heart rate generator is forced is not simply pro-\nportional to the amplitude of breathing, as measured by our\ntechnique, but may be due to some specific features of the\nnonlinearity of the system. Consistent with the classical\ntheory, however, we failed to find any synchronization re-\ngions with m.10, in full agreement with predictions about\nthe improbability of falling within them under the given ex-\nperimental conditions.\nComparison between experiments conducted with the\nsame subjects on different days have shown that, even where\nthe detuning and amplitude are quite close, the structure of9-6\nREGIONS OF CARDIORESPIRATORY . . .

The first column gives results from the first session\nwith subjects 1, 2, and 3; the second column gives results from the second session with subjects 2 and 3; and the third column gives the\nresults for subjects 4, 5, and 6. Dashed lines mark the amplitude of respiration versus the frequency ratio and, for first ~or only! sessions, are\nprecisely the same as in Fig. 6~b!. Shaded tongues show the inferred synchronization regions, their tips pointing to the corresponding n:m\nrotation number. These results are to be compared with the predictions of the classical theory as sketched in Fig. 1. Details are given in the\ntext.the synchronization regions is not precisely reproduced: Sub-\nject 3 reproduced four out of eight synchronization regions\nduring his second session; whereas subject 2 reproduced\nonly one of seven synchronization regions. The second sets\nof measurements also demonstrated synchronization orders\nthat were absent during the first sessions.\nNevertheless, regimes of synchronization with certain\nn:m are realized in particular subjects more frequently than\nin others. Namely, 2:5 synchronization was induced in all 6\nsubjects, 1:2 and 1:3 in 4, 1:7 and 3:5 in 3. Other types of\nsynchronization appear occasionally. Cardiorespiratory syn-\nchronization can be induced with greatest probability in the\nrange of paced respiration frequency 0.15\u20130.5 Hz.\nAs to the effectiveness of synchronization of different or-\nders, one can note from Fig. 10~a! that the most effective\nsynchronization was 1:3 in those subjects where it was in-\nduced. This means that the average duration of the corre-\nsponding plateaus was the longest of all synchronization or-\nders. It is known that the typical range of breathing\nfrequencies in the relaxed state lies between 1\/6 and 1\/3 of\nthe average heart rate @16#. Note, that the breathing fre-\nquency inducing 1:3 synchronization is on the borderline of05190those which are most common in the relaxed state. Although\nbeing the most effective, 1:3 synchronization was encoun-\ntered in only 2\/3 of all subjects. The next most effective\nregime was 1:2 synchronization, which requires an even less\nnatural breathing frequency. The next regime was 2:5 which\nwas found in all subjects studied. Although being the most\nprevalent, the 2:5 synchronization appeared to be less effec-\ntive than the 1:3 and 1:2 ones. Note that the denominator of\nthis synchronization order is larger than 4 which means that\nthis resonance is weak. The corresponding tongue is ex-\npected to be narrower than those for 1:2 and 1:3, which is\nindeed observed in our experiments. The remaining two\ncommon orders of synchronization were 1:7 and 3:5, both\nclassified as weak resonances. Synchronization of orders 1:6,\n1:5 and 1:4 appeared much more rarely, namely, 1:4 and 1:6\nin 1\/3 and 1:5 in 1\/6 of all subjects.\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\nWe note that to draw global conclusions, a larger study\nwill be required, and that it will be interesting to study how\nthe synchronization phenomena depend on, for example, the9-7\nRZECZINSKI et al.
