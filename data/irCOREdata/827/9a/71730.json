The research we discuss investigates two \ncase studies of deliberative exercises used by local authorities to develop their Local \nTransport Plans, chosen as exemplars of authorities seen to be at the forefront of \nparticipatory transport planning.  Our analysis avoids the rather simplistic \u2018check list\u2019 \nevaluative models based upon the Habermasian ideals of communicative rationality \nand instead develops an approach which attends to the power relations embedded in \nthe process of participation. Significantly, the research, across a range of stakeholder \ngroups, reveals a deeply problematic relationship between citizen involvement and \nestablished structures of democratic decision-making - reflected in an emphasis on \n(soft) relational outcomes to the virtual exclusion of (hard) policy impacts.  We draw \nattention to the institutional constraints which account for the limited realisation of the \nparticipatory agenda in local governance.   Conclusions are developed relating to both \nthe process of participation evaluation and the wider consequences (intended and \nunintended) of the expansion of public involvement for the renewal of local democracy.   \n \n \n \n \n 2\nIntroduction \nSince the mid-1990s an increasingly hegemonic discourse coalition has developed in \nthe UK around the need to engage the public more directly in policy development and \ndecision-making (Blair 1998, DETR 1998, LGA 1998, House of Lords 2000, POST \n2001, UK Research Councils 2002, RCEP 1998).  This discourse has emerged in \nresponse to a perceived crisis of legitimation in government and a questioning of the \nnormative and functional adequacy of democratic institutions and of the rights and \nresponsibilities of citizens.  Traditional representative democracy, it has been argued, \nhas become dysfunctional (Coote and Lenaghan 1997, Cooper et al 1995), unable to \nadequately respond to declining public participation in political processes or the \ngrowing public distrust of authority and expertise (House of Lords 2000, IPPR 2004).  \nAccordingly, the current government\u2019s modernising agenda has sought to engender \ndemocratic renewal and reactivate citizen responsibilities (DETR 1998) - in part \nthrough vigorous engagement and an opening up of policy processes. The pervasive \nrhetoric of public dialogue and involvement in decision-making can be found across \nvarious spheres of governance including environment (Petts 2001, Jones et al 2002, \nEnvironment Agency 2002, Burgess et al 1998), health care policy and service delivery \n(Barnes 1999, McIvor 1998, Pickard 1998, Abelson et al 2003), urban planning and \nregeneration (Burns and Taylor 2000, Wates 1999) and risk management (Atherton \nand Hunt 2002, Cabinet Office 2002, DEFRA 2001, 2002).  \n \nMuch of the substantial activity accompanying this rhetorical shift has taken place \nwithin local government.  Driven by both the national government participatory agenda \nand local advocacy for the broadening of participation, UK local authorities have been \n 3\nexperimenting with \u2018new\u2019 and deliberative methods of stakeholder and public \ninvolvement. Local Agenda 21 provided an early catalyst for innovation with various \nmodels of local stakeholder involvement emerging in the production of sustainable \ndevelopment strategies at different levels of local and regional government \n(Buckingham-Hatfield and Percy 1999).  Other processes of local policy and plan \ndevelopment have built on this experience, including participation related to the \ndrawing up of local air quality management plans (DETR 2000a), local transport plans \n(DETR 1999) and community strategies (DETR 2000b).  Within this local level activity \nthe objective of enabling deliberation rather than consultation has often been central. \nDeliberation is defined by Wakeford (2001) as the process by which participants \ninteract, engage in considered debate and modify their views based on information, \nshared views and respect for different perspectives. Deliberative methods seek to \novercome the communicative barriers that lead to adversarial styles of interaction (such \nas traditional public meetings) and also aim, at least in principle, for a certain \nredistribution of power and an equalising of the resources and ability of different parties \nto speak.    \n \nOur purpose in this paper is to bring some critical reflection to bear on this upsurge of \nparticipatory rhetoric and activity in local governance, through in particular examining \ninitiatives that have taken place in UK local transport planning.  For whilst a move \ntowards the broadening of involvement in local decision-making must fundamentally be \n\u2018a good thing\u2019 for those committed to democratic ideals, and a project we would broadly \nseek to support, we are equally concerned that this is taken forward critically and with \nfull appreciation of the challenges involved.  There are, for example, fundamental \n 4\nquestions to ask about what the aims and objectives of participation are to be and the \nrelationship between new participatory processes and established practices of \nmanagerialism and representative democracy in local government. What are \nparticipatory initiatives actually delivering and what has changed from the processes \nthat existed beforehand?  Are participatory and deliberative processes making a \ndifference, and is this difference an improvement?  \n \nSuch questioning of the new participatory agenda has become an increasing feature of \nrecent commentary and analysis, maybe inevitably as the first wave of enthusiasm for \nnew ways of working has ceded to critical evaluation, reflection and learning from \nexperience (Liberatore and Funtowicz 2003).   Owens (2000) argues, for example, that \nsimply redesigning processes of participation will not be sufficient to realise a civic \nmodel of deliberation and could indeed be counterproductive.  She calls for a critical \nconsideration of how and whether new ways of engaging the public \u2018can avoid the \npitfalls of the old\u2019 and for an analytical focus on the nature and failures of the \ninstitutional contexts within which processes are being employed.   In a similar vein, \nRayner (2003) raises the possibility that new participatory practices may be becoming \npart of a managerial approach to politics rather than instruments of real empowerment \nor democratisation; a concern also articulated by Hajer and Kesselring (1999) through \nan analysis of processes of engagement in transport policy in Munich. O\u2019Neill (2001) \nhighlights problems of representation in small deliberative fora, which, he argues, raise \nquestions of political and ethical legitimacy and the need for \u2018a clearer account\u2019 of the \nrole of such fora in democratic institutions.   \n \n 5\nA good deal of analytical attention has centred on and critiqued the Habermasian \nprinciples of communicative rationality that underpin much of the upsurge of \nparticipatory effort.  For Habermas the roots of cooperation are found in the very \nstructure of language. Through conversation and debate, he contends, people \nrationally and inevitably move towards reasonable (and consensual) judgements and \nagreements. The communicative rationality of a process of deliberation depends upon \na number of principles being met - conditions of what Habermas terms the ideal speech \nsituation.  Individuals representing all the important interests in the issue must be at the \ntable.  All the stakeholders must be fully, and equally, informed and able to represent \ntheir interests.  The discussion must be carried out in terms of good reasons, so that \nthe power of a good argument is the important dynamic.  It must allow all claims and \nassumptions to be questioned \u2013 and all constraints to be tested. Crucially, all must be \nequally empowered.  For Habermas, power-equalising communicative practice is \nensured by having a procedure where all claims are evaluated through commonly \naccepted principles of comprehensibility, integrity, legitimacy and truth (or accuracy).  \nLike scientific method, the conditions of communicative rationality will never fully be \nmet, but the attempt to approximate them should, it is argued, help ensure that \ndecisions take into account important knowledge and perspectives, that they are in \nsome sense socially just and that they do not simply co-opt those in weaker positions \n(Innes and Booher 1999).  \n \nCritiques of the Habermassian ideal and how this has underpinned the development \nand use of deliberative methods in local governance have, however, increasingly \nturned to Foucault\u2019s perspective on discourse and power and the notion that \n 6\nparticipation (or discourse) is constrained by, hides, and at the same time perpetuates \ncertain sets of power relations. For example, work in the field of critical planning theory \nhas challenged the idealism of communicative rationality and questioned the \nemancipatory achievements and potential of participatory innovations in the UK and \nelsewhere (Tewdwr-Jones and Allmendinger 1998, Huxley 2000, McGuirk 2001, \nFlybjerg 1998a, Rydin 2003).  Many of these authors have, in particular, questioned \nwhether the process goal of consensus is possible or even desirable in a world of \nincreasing difference.  Seeking shared values they argue may actually silence rather \nthan give voice (Tewdwr-Jones and Allmendinger 1998).  There are interesting \nparallels here with recent highly critical accounts of the use of participatory methods in \ndeveloping countries, with Cooke and Kothari (2001) arguing that these have become a \n\u2018new tyranny\u2019 facilitating the illegitimate and unjust exercise of power.  Such a trenchant \nchallenge to the current orthodoxy may at first sight appear inappropriate to the UK \ncontext, but the focus of this critique on relations of power and the ritualised use of \nparticipatory techniques may prove instructive for understanding the challenges and \npotential implications of the participatory shift that has taken place. \n \nAlongside drawing on this literature we also seek to shed some critical light on the \napproaches that have been used to assess recent experiments in participatory \ndemocracy in the UK.  Much of the participatory research, which explicitly deals with \nevaluation, is based on a set of rather narrowly focussed procedural criteria derived \nfrom the ideals of communicative rationality.  These evaluative models typically involve \nan assessment framework which considers two meta-criteria: fairness and competence \n(Webler 1995). Fairness relates to the sufficiency of opportunities that each and every \n 7\nperson will have to protect and express their legitimate individual interests and to \ncontribute to the development of the collective will. Competence refers to the ability of \nthe participation decision-making process to provide the participants with the \nprocedural tools and knowledge needed to make the best possible decisions (Petts \n1995, 2001, McIver 1998, Beierle and Cayford 2000,  Renn et al 1995, Webler  and \nTuler 1998, Rowe and Frewer 2000).  In most cases assessment is systematically \nstructured to allow comparability across different participatory methods.  In contrast, \nonly a small number of studies have considered the outcomes rather than the process \nof participation (cf. Seargent and Steele 1999). Most of these are based on in-depth \ncase studies that explore participants\u2019 goals and satisfaction immediately following their \ninvolvement (e.g. Rosener 1981, Sommer 2001, Santos and Chess 2003, Burns and \nTaylor 2000) and few address longer-term policy or decision-making impacts (e.g. \nBeirele 2002) or the institutional constraints that impede policy outcomes.  This lack of \nattention to impacts is, in part at least, down to the fact that questions about the \ntemporality of outcomes go well beyond the scope and lifetime of most evaluative \nframeworks \u2013 which are characteristically short term and oriented to providing a \njudgement of efficacy.  Linked to this are the difficulties involved in establishing cause-\neffect relationships when participation is one of many inputs into decision-making \nprocesses (also Abelson et al 2003).  \n \nThe research we discuss in this paper, with the aim of contributing to both substantial \nand methodological debates, has investigated participatory activities in English \ntransport planning.  Whilst we do consider the specific circumstances associated with \ntransport planning (see also Bickerstaff et al 2002) our principal purpose here is to \n 8\ndevelop insights regarding the achievements and constraints to enacting the \nparticipatory agenda across local governance. As noted above transport is one of a \nnumber of areas of local government responsibility where public involvement has \nbecome more central, reflecting an expectation that this may garner wider local support \nfor and ownership of transport decisions (DETR 1999, DfT 20041).  Authorities in \nEngland are required to plan and deliver Local Transport Plans (LTP\u2019s) - five-year \nprogrammes for managing and enhancing transport services within a comprehensive \nmulti-modal strategy for the achievement of local and national objectives (DETR 1999).  \nLTP\u2019s are essentially bidding documents with funding allocation dependent on \nassessment of the strength and quality of submissions based on a series of criteria set \nout by central government. Guidance on Local Transport Plans (1999) laid down \ngovernment expectations and requirements for participation across a range of strategy \ndomains.  The first provisional LTP\u2019s were submitted in July 1999 with the full plans \nfinalised a year later.  The second round of LTP\u2019s requires local authorities to prepare a \nnew plan by the end of July 2005 (provisional) to be revised and finalised by March \n2006.  Less prescriptive or demanding expectations are set out for involvement in the \nsecond round of LTP\u2019s with a stronger emphasis on engaging local stakeholders rather \nthan \u2018the public\u2019 as such (DfT 2004).  Particular importance is, however, attached to \nevidence that local authorities have sought to \u201cachieve local support for potentially \ncontroversial transport proposals e.g. congestion charging\u201d (Ibid, 16). \n \n                                                          \n1 The Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DEFRA) was dismantled in \n2002 with transport responsibilities transferred to the newly created Department for Transport \n(DoT).  \n \n 9\nOur research has investigated two case studies of deliberative exercises used by local \nauthorities to develop their LTP\u2019s, chosen as exemplars of authorities seen to be in the \nforefront of participatory transport planning.  In considering these two case studies we \nfocus, in particular, on those aspects that are often hidden in simplistic \u2018check list\u2019 \napproaches to evaluating participatory processes - power relations, outcomes and \ndemocratic practice \u2013 but which we argue are central to understanding the tensions \nthat are being played out at a local level.  To do so, we bring together the voices of \ndifferent actors involved in processes of deliberation to ground (theoretically and \nempirically) our approach and to expose commonalities and contrasts of perspective.  \nFor analytical purposes we distinguish between aspects of process (the discourse \nspace) and outcomes (policy impacts, relational changes and the institutional \nconstraints to outcomes) - although these categories do overlap. We also address the \ntemporal abstraction of much research on public participation by exploring people\u2019s \nreflections at some distance from the original participatory and plan-making process.   \nA similar post-hoc approach has been productively applied by Davies (2002) in \nevaluating the relational and policy outcomes of a partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment.  \n \nWe begin our discussion with a brief description of the case studies and research \nmethods and then move on to an analysis of interviewee accounts.  We then draw \nconclusions related to both the process of researching participative and deliberative \nexercises and the wider consequences (intended and unintended) of the expansion of \npublic involvement for the renewal of local democracy.  \n \n 10\nCase studies and research methods \nThe empirical discussion in this paper draws upon a two-part project examining how \n\u2018public participation\u2019 has been conceptualised and implemented within local transport \nplanning practice in England.  In the late 1990\u2019s a new responsibility for the \ndevelopment of integrated local transport plans was given to local highway authorities \u2013 \nwith expectations for public involvement in producing these plans laid out in national \npolicy guidance (see also Bickerstaff and Walker 2001). The first phase of our research \nhad the objective of establishing the extent to which both traditional and more \ninnovative participatory processes had been applied in the development of LTP\u2019s. It \ntherefore involved a broad survey of English highway authorities and a content analysis \nof provisional LTP documents (see Bickerstaff et al 2002, Bickerstaff and Walker 2001 \nfor discussion of this work). The second \u2018case-study\u2019 phase, and the focus of this \npaper, sought to evaluate \u2018best practice\u2019 examples of participatory processes in more \ndepth.  Two local authority areas were selected - Warrington Borough Council (W.B.C.) \nand Warwickshire County Council (W.C.C.) \u2013 both standing out in the survey analysis \nas authorities that had not only employed a range of different involvement techniques \nbut had also developed and adopted novel, deliberative methods. In addition, each \nauthority performed well in our analysis of the LTP documents, which drew upon the \npublic involvement criteria or descriptors used by the DETR to assess the quality of \nplans (DETR 1999).  The cases were also selected to offer variation in terms of local \nauthority political structure and culture.  Warwickshire is a two tier County Council \nwhich, in producing a Local Transport Plan, must co-ordinate with five separate District \nCouncils.  As a county authority W.C.C. has experience of consultation under the \nprevious funding framework for transport \u2013 a style of engagement characterised by the \n 11\nauthority itself as \u201cdraft, announce and defend\u201d (W.C.C. 2000, 1).  In contrast, W.B.C. \nis a Unitary Authority (a status attained in 1998) with less experience of consultation \n(under the prior political structure it did not hold transportation responsibilities), but \nseeking to assert an independent identity and a capacity to make decisions and decide \npolicy without reference to an outside county authority.  In contrast to Warwickshire, \nWarrington covers a smaller, largely urban, geographical area \u2013 associated with \nsmaller numbers of interest groups.  Finally, both authorities were prepared to \ncooperate in the research.   \n \nIn terms of the participatory processes that the two authorities embarked upon, W.B.C. \ndeveloped a programme which utilised a range of methods, beginning in 1999 with a \nmajor leafleting campaign. This was followed by four separate round-table meetings \nwith key stakeholders (representatives of interest groups) - sessions that dealt with pre-\ndefined issues central to the government\u2019s White Paper on transportation (1998).  Each \nroundtable meeting was attended by 12-24 participants. The stated aim was to solicit \ndetailed comments on the substance of the emerging LTP from stakeholders with \nestablished knowledge and experience of transport matters (W.B.C. 1999, 30). The \nfinal element of the programme involved nine focus groups with sectors of the \npopulation that it was felt may have distinctive views on transport (e.g. the disabled, \nyoung people).  A number of traditional participatory techniques (exhibitions, a \nhousehold survey) were also used.   \n \nThe second case study authority, Warwickshire County Council, adopted consensus-\nbuilding methods involving a cross-section of stakeholders from across the county \u2013 \n 12\nbut as with Warrington attendees were all representatives of particular interest groups. \nThe consensus building process began in 1998 consisting of four rounds of meetings, \nwith between 75-100 organisations or individuals taking part in each event, following \nthe main stages in development of the final LTP \u2013 from identification of problems and \nvisions, to strategy development and then through to drafting targets and measures \n(W.C.C. 2000).  Community groups were also given the opportunity to run their own \nconsensus building exercises and meetings were arranged with groups who were felt \nto be under-represented at the main events (e.g. small community groups in rural \nareas). Several traditional methods (a representative survey and exhibitions) were, \nagain, used alongside the deliberative exercises.   \n \nIn order to access a diversity of actors\u2019 evaluations of these processes a total of 42 \nsemi-structured interviews were undertaken - made up of 32 participants, six council \nofficers (two of the officer interviews related to local authorities other than W.B.C. or \nW.C.C. that had used innovative deliberative mechanisms) and four council members. \nThe interviews each lasted between 1\u00bd - 2 hours and were designed to explore how \nthe participatory exercises were carried out, what was achieved and not achieved, and \nhow the various participants felt about their involvement.  In the case of the participant \ninterviewees, lists of attendees were first assembled with the assistance of local \nauthority officers (these were partial given gaps in record keeping) and from this \ninformation two contact lists of 20-25 people were drawn up. Since all participants \ncame as representatives of local interests in each of the deliberative processes (the \nWarrington roundtables and the Warwickshire consensus building exercise) sampling, \nas far as possible, aimed for a mixture of interests (business, user groups, \n 13\nenvironmental interests, civic groups, residents groups) as well as a small number of \nlocal authority participants (from other sections\/district councils).  Contact was made \nwith all of these individuals (in one case this had to be done initially through the local \nauthority) and interviews carried out with those that were willing\/able to take part.  \n \nThe interviews took place between October and December 2000.  This was after the \npublication of both the provisional LTP\u2019s in July 1999 (and the preliminary DETR \nassessment in December) and the final LTP\u2019s in July 2000, but just prior to the final \nassessment and allocation of resources from central government in the December \n2000.  Each of the interviews was transcribed and coded using an iterative procedure, \nwhere categories were identified and developed through an interaction between \nconcepts and themes emerging from the data and theoretical ideas derived from \ncommunicative rationality and its critiques.  \n \nOur discussion of the interviewee accounts is structured into two themes, the nature of \nthe discourse space and participation outcomes.  In terms of criticisms of participation \nthese themes recurred, both explicitly and more implicitly, throughout the interviewees \nassessments of the two deliberative processes.  Although we do highlight some areas \nof contrast between the two authorities, our argument is that beyond these relatively \nminor differences we can identify generic reflections and concerns, which offer an \ninsight into the realities of the \u2018participatory turn\u2019 in local transport planning and more \nbroadly local governance.  In the discussion which follows we use verbatim quotes \nfrom the stakeholder interviews, identifying whether the speaker was a participant (and \nif so giving representative affiliations), officer or council member. \n 14\nThe discourse space  \nThe (Habermasian) conceptualisation of deliberation aims for the achievement of an \nequality in the ability (or competence) of all parities involved in debate, to put views \nforward, challenge the claims of others and to have an influence on outputs and \noutcomes. As discussed earlier the central weakness and critique of the theoretically \nattractive ideals of communicative rationality is that relations of power are not simply \nput to one side on entering the deliberative forum, delivering some sort of relational \nneutrality, but are actually brought into and shape the process of deliberation.  \n \nThe permanence of power relations within the LTP deliberations was a strong feature \nin the accounts of many participants, often supported by the remarks of council officers \nand members.  In part this related to relations between participants and government \ninstitutions (cf. Davies 2002, Santos and Chess 2003). For many people early \nenthusiasm for the process had begun to give way to doubts and scepticism about the \npurposes and institutional drivers underlying these exercises.  Participants often \ncommented to the effect that the local authority was obligated to carry out participatory \nexercises, \u2018they had no choice\u2019, or that motivations were grounded in the legitimation of \ndecisions already made.  Many were concerned that their involvement in processes of \ndeliberation and consensus building was amounting to a process of co-option and a \nneutering of oppositional politics. Participants were consequently left to make choices \nabout whether and how to participate given the potential links between inclusion and \nsubordination.  It was noticeable that this was a position most clearly articulated by \nthose participating in the Warwickshire exercise.  This greater cynicism regarding the \ndrivers of participatory initiatives can be linked to what many people talked about as the \n 15\nauthority\u2019s poor track-record of engaging the local community.  These concerns do, as \nthe following remark demonstrates, present a very real tension between a closer \ninteraction with the local authority and the ability or power to criticise and challenge \n(also Barnes 1999b, Abelson et al 2003).  \n \nI feel it\u2019s sort of softened up the debate a bit somehow and therefore, it\u2019s a \nbit like do you want to go down a Greenpeace line on these issues and just \nhave your\u2026 strongly state your view, and don\u2019t sort of get into cosy \nrelationships with people and you can go on doing that.  Whether you want \nto take that line or whether you think you\u2019re going to get more results by \nbeing a responsible and patient negotiator on these issues with people who \nnow want to be your friend rather than a faceless enemy (Participant, male, \ncivic interest)  \n \nA central question for many participants related to the distribution of control over \ndeliberation between stakeholders.  The framing and scope of debate have been \nidentified as critical in determining whether the process empowers people or merely \nlegitimises established power relations (e.g. Irwin 2001, Pickard 1998, Pratchett 1999, \nSantos and Chess 2003). What was clear in both case studies was that the agenda for \ndebate was strongly defined from above \u2013 a structure that was inflexible to any further \nrevision.  So in this sense community knowledge did not (and could not) determine or \nmodify decision-making processes, but was instead articulated through and organised \nby existing professional structures (also Cooke and Kothari 2001, Rydin 2003).  The \nnarrow parameters of debate drew criticism from a range of participants \u2013 principally, \n 16\nthat events were too focussed on the generalities, ignoring big structural projects and \ncircumventing all talk of money.   \n \nInterviewer: In terms of improving it what would you say the key areas \nare? \nI think the main thing is the feeling that in the end we were powerless \nbecause we didn\u2019t have a say on how the money was divided up, how the \nbid was actually going to be made.  We could say nice things, put forward \nnice idealist views but they then go away and make hard-nosed decisions.  \n(Participant, female, environmental interest) \n \nBeyond the scope of debate, Owens (2000) raises the questions of how the baggage \ncarried into deliberative fora bears upon the identities and values that they produce and \nhow power is deployed within such processes.  Reflecting similar concerns Cooke and \nKothari (2001) point to the tyranny of the group \u2013 where group dynamics lead to \nparticipatory decisions that reinforce the interests of the already powerful.  Our case \nstudy work similarly revealed distortions in deliberative processes based on relations \nbetween different participant constituencies and the (inequitable) distribution of \ncommunicative and knowledge resources (see also Abelson et al 2003, Flyvbjerg \n1998a, DfT 2004).  Individual participants often articulated, or were seen by others to \nhold, strong ideological and instrumental reasons for taking part, leading to distortions \nwithin the process of deliberation.  In democratic terms the result was either \nintransigence and a lack of movement or a skewed \u2018consensus\u2019 reflecting the partial \ninterests of a vocal and powerful (in a communicative sense at least) minority.  In the \n 17\nfollowing extracts the speakers reflect on the limits to deliberation (or the achievement \nof a shared vision) given the strong positions that people taking part had adopted \u2013 and \nmaintained.  \n \nAnd they\u2019re representatives of [erm] residents associations from a particular \npart of the town, and on their mind is one thing, we need a bypass through \nour bit of town, or whatever sort of issue there is, so that people bring their \nown agendas [\u2026] So it probably wasn\u2019t realistic to expect to sort of get \nmembers of the public together to come up with a sort of shared vision in \nany practical way. (Participant, male, business interest) \n \nFrom my experience when we\u2019ve tried to organise residents groups or \nanything else the people who come are generally the people with some sort \nof an axe to grind, they\u2019ve got some sort of an interest.  (Council member, \nfemale) \n \nIn some cases the search for consensus itself was seen as a mechanism of silencing \nrather than of giving voice \u2013 where individuals held opinions that conflicted with the \nmajority. As Huxley argues, drawing on Foucault, a conception of communicative \naction that presupposes consensus could come close to being an instrument for \ndiscipline and a rather unbearable group pressure (2000, 372).  The following extract \ngives an example of such pressure: \n \n 18\nProbably there\u2019s a thing to impress the others in the group.  And this \nschoolmistress she [\u2026] agreed with what I said, she told me \u201cyes, I agree\u201d \n\u2013 again that was during the break while no-one else was there, and again \nthey\u2019re [the participants] frightened to say something, of upsetting the rest \n[\u2026] But if you\u2019re asking me about the tables [the \u2018roundtable\u2019 discussions], \nthey\u2019re almost frightened to say something. (Participant, male, civic \ninterest) \n \nThese power inequalities and instrumental motivations were perpetuated through a \nrange of strategies and tactics (not always consciously calculated), performed both \nwithin and external to the deliberative forum. Drawing on the typology of sociological \naction adopted by Tewdwr-Jones and Allmendinger (1998) these strategies can \nusefully be grouped into teleological, normatively regulated or dramaturgical \nbehaviours. \n \nTeleological action: This is goal-oriented action where people used argumentative or \nother tactics explicitly or more implicitly to achieve their ends.  This type of action \nincludes recourse to alternative channels of influence beyond the deliberative forum \n(also Flyvbjerg 1998a), for example:  \n \nIn our group we had a representative of a car company and he was a very \nhigh animal and of course he was an executive, he was able [erm], to \nspeak his mind and manipulate people and he would always have an \n 19\nanswer on anything and he was constantly talking (Participant, female, \nresidents\u2019 interest) \n \nIt is slightly beholden on us that if we do have views about various aspects \nto make those known separately, that, that [\u2018deliberative\u2019 involvement] has \nto be done very carefully so that we\u2019re not sort of undermining the \nsubmissions that we\u2019ve sort of supported. (Participant, male, business \ninterest) \n \nNormatively regulated behaviour: There are also instances where pre-defined common \nvalues are used to ensure individuals complied with a particular set of group norms \n(Rydin 2003). In a number of cases we found that representatives of a range of interest \ngroups, who shared similar goals or values, chose to work together, to agree objectives \nand priorities.  In this way they were able to pool power in deliberative fora to ensure a \nparticular instrumental purpose was met. Such responses were more characteristic of \nthe W.C.C. case \u2013 reflecting not only the greater continuity in involvement (i.e. \nparticipants could attend all rather than a single event) but also the more extensive and \nestablished interest group networks that were in place. Whilst W.B.C. lacked the \nnumber of what one council member termed \u2019consultation groupies\u2019 (and thus the \npotential for co-operative behaviours), several participants did comment to the effect \nthat they would take a more tactical approach in future involvement. What we see \nresulting from participation, and evident in the quote below, is the acquisition of \nplanning knowledge or an understanding of the institutional context, which supports the \nposition of powerful actors (Ibid).   \n 20\nThere were a number of us that were trying to achieve similar things and I \nthink if we\u2019d known better ahead of time we would have made more \nheadway I think, but we were all novices at it relatively speaking \nInterviewer: In what way can you make headway if you don\u2019t know \nwhat you are going into? \nYou\u2019re going into a consensus building process [\u2026]  and you know that it \nwill be difficult to get a particular segment of view across so you\u2019d work out \nstrategies and tactics before going into it \u2013 which is much more difficult \nonce you\u2019re into it because you\u2019re split up [\u2026] because one of you\u2019s in this \ngroup, and one in that and another, and it\u2019s very difficult once the process \nis started to say look I really think we\u2019re going to fail to get across the point, \nthat this is crucial - whereas if you\u2019d gone to it knowing that this is a crucial \npoint and everybody\u2019s agreed that it\u2019s a crucial point (Participant, female, \nenvironmental interest). \n \nDramaturgical behaviour: Participants sometimes chose to hide a particular image of \nthemselves to evoke an acceptable representation to the \u2018consensus audience\u2019 in order \nto minimise antagonism.  This was particularly the case for business representatives \nwho felt that full openness about organisational goals and values, which were likely to \nconflict with the participating majority, would damage their \u2018public image\u2019.  Rather, they \nfavoured alternative communicative channels to make their \u2018substantive\u2019 \nrepresentations to the council.  So to use the terminology of Irving Goffman (1969) we \nsee, within the deliberative forum, front stage performances or modes of interaction \n 21\nthat conceal (not necessarily in an overt manner) the real reality of the back stage and \ncome to be taken for that reality (see also Kothari 2001). \n \nMy view is that the degree to which we\u2019re able in that type of forum to have \nan open and honest debate is very limited \u2013 cause obviously the other thing \nis you\u2019ve got an awful lot of people there that you can potentially upset if \nyou say the wrong thing because of the nature of the people \u2026.So you do \nhave to, you have to mind your p\u2019s and q\u2019s when you\u2019re in that environment. \n(Participant, female, business interest) \n \nThe discussion in this section does clearly show how, within the deliberative process, \npower relations map onto the process of participation. Some individuals or groups have \nthe skill or authority to present their interests in more generally valid terms, which \nothers do not (Mosse 2001).  Importantly, these power relations and the strategic \nbehaviours that accompany them were very real to the participants in the deliberative \nfora.  Such relational distortions are very far from the equalizing of communicative \nskills, procedural tools and neutrality of strategic objectives envisioned by the \nHabermasian conceptualization of the ideal speech situation.    \n \nWe have, however, focused so far on the process of participation.  It is also important \nto consider the interaction of relations of power with the outcomes of deliberative fora \u2013 \nthat is the nature of policy and non-policy impacts including relational consequences \nand the institutional barriers which constrain change.  It is to these outcome issues that \nwe now turn.  \n 22\nThe outcomes of deliberation \nThe outcomes of deliberation are one dimension of participation evaluation which \nremains both poorly operationalised and in itself problematic to assess.  This reflects a \nlack of agreement on what constitutes an outcome, how it should be measured, as well \nas the difficulty in tracking any impacts beyond the particular event and in establishing \ndirect cause-effect relationships.  Whilst we cannot hope to provide a comprehensive \napproach to conceptualising and assessing outcomes, the retrospective focus of the \nstudy does allow us to explore some of the distinctions and complexities raised by this \ndimension of researching participation.  Here we distinguish specifically between policy \noutcomes, relational impacts and finally the institutional constraints that limit the \noutcomes of participation.  \n \nPolicy outcomes: interpretation and transparency \nAs noted already one of the key questions for participatory democracy centres on what \nnew deliberative processes are actually delivering in terms of policy outcomes: how \nthese deliberations are being interpreted by officials, and how decisions are altered as \na result.  \n \nThe general findings of research in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, which considers \nthe impacts of participation, suggests that participation is not having a substantive \neffect on policy processes and decision outcomes (Flyvbjerg 1998a, Bickerstaff and \nWalker 2001, Davies 2002, Tewdr Jones and Allmendinger 1998, Tewdr-Jones and \nThomas 1998, Lowndes 2001a, Barnes 1999b, Abelson et al 2003).  A survey of best \npractice in local authorities by the Audit Commission found that three quarters failed to \n 23\nlink the results of consultation with decision-making processes (1999, 41).  Indeed, an \nevaluation of the LTP process itself found that authorities had not been successful \u201cin \nfeeding the results of consultation back into the process in terms of redefining \nobjectives or programme priorities\u201d (DfT 2004, 44-45).  The translation of the range of \nparticipatory outputs into usable policy instruments required the planners to sort \nthrough and prioritise an \u2018argumentative jumble\u2019 of inputs based on diverse systems of \nknowledge, value, and meaning (Healey 1997). As Mosse (2001) and others (Tewdwr-\nJones and Allmendinger 1998, McGuirk 2001, Abelson et al 2003, Chess and Santos \n2003, Barnes et al 2003, Flyvbjerg 1998a) argue, project actors are not neutral \nfacilitators of local knowledge. At the most basic level officers own the research tools, \nchoose the themes for debate, establish rules of dialogue and abstract and summarise \naccording to relevant institutional criteria.  \n \nWhen officers and council members were asked to explain how the public deliberations \nhad specifically influenced the development of the LTP they often found it difficult to do \nso (see also DfT 2004). Where direct links were made between public involvement and \nthe LTP outcome, the \u2018involvement\u2019 was usually through a traditional opinion survey - \nfor which quantified data could be reported and summarised in an accepted manner.   \nFor officers the survey data gave answers to precise questions \u2013 which, as Hoggett \nhas argued (1995), reflects a preference for forms of consultation which only give \nexpression to the power-holders\u2019 definition of the problem.   Importantly, a key concern \nof public agencies is to generate responses which are representative of their \ncommunities (also Leach and Wingfield 1999, Seargent and Steele 1999). In this sense \nthe sample populations associated with large scale surveys (whether fully \n 24\nrepresentative or not) were talked about as more balanced and reliable, lending a \nlegitimacy to policy-making that could not be matched by deliberative methods.  \n \nIn the few cases where the outputs of the deliberative processes were referred to, this \ntook the form of participant testimonies being used to legitimise the official discourse, \nrather than to structure aspects of the plan or present an alternative view.  As one \nofficer commented: \n \n When you read the Local Transport Plan you\u2019ll be able to see places \nwhere their contribution [quotes] was actually slotted in (Transport officer, \nmale).   \n \nAnalysis of the LTP documentation from both local authorities similarly suggests a \nrather ambiguous interpretation of the outputs of participation.  Overall, the W.B.C. \nplans did make stronger links between outputs and (changes to) the plan documents \u2013 \na contrast which may in part reflect differences in administrative structure and political \nculture.   In the case of W.B.C., whilst the provisional LTP gives little evidence of how \nstrategies took account of the participation process, it does catalogue the responses \nand gives the council\u2019s reaction to them.  In the final LTP (W.B.C. 2000a) the \nparticipation programme is attributed with influencing the wording of one of the core \nobjectives (which correspond to those set out in government guidance), and the priority \nattached to different road uses. The plan\u2019s emphasis on road safety, developing \nwalking and cycling strategies, proposals for improving public transport and the \nrecommendation that congestion charging and paying for workplace parking should not \n 25\nbe pursued, are all linked to data (primarily quantitative) from the consultation \nprogramme. Whilst a companion report on the consultation process does detail the \nmethodology, responses and application of results, it is still difficult to establish the \nprecise role of the participatory methods, particularly the deliberative elements, and \ntheir importance relative to other decision-making inputs.  \n \nThe W.C.C. consensus building process is linked in the final LTP document (W.C.C. \n2000) to influencing the identification of transport problems and the strategic \nformulation of the plan.  However, as with the Warrington LTP, it is not clear how far \nthe consultation outputs contributed something new to the plan or their importance \nrelative to other policy factors.  The ambiguity in the status of participatory outputs and \ntheir transformation into outcomes is clear in the following quote from the LTP:  \n \nThis new approach means that it is not possible to answer the question that \nhas been posed \u201cto what extent did the consensus building exercise \ninfluence the strategy?\u201d [\u2026] It cannot be answered when consultation \ninitiated the process before any strategy had been drafted.  The strategy \nemerged from the consultation in a \u2018seamless\u2019 manner. (W.C.C. 2000, 1).   \n \nRather, \u2018influence\u2019 is demonstrated through the incorporation of results, again mainly in \nthe form of statistics, where considered appropriate (Ibid, 3).  Yet, it is not made clear \nwhat constitutes appropriateness and why. Like Warrington the council sought views \non traffic reduction targets and associated demand management measures, and the \nselection of more conservative targets than set out in government advice was linked to \n 26\nthe results of a ranking exercise.  Neither Warwickshire nor Warrington effectively \naddressed the issue of consulting disadvantaged groups in assessing the needs of the \nsocially excluded \u2013 an issue which does point to the problems in widening participation \nbeyond the \u2018usual suspects\u2019.  Nor did they open the consultation agenda up to the \nsubject of major infrastructural projects (i.e. new road schemes). \n \nSo both the interview and textual analyses suggest that deliberative materials are \ntranslated into, and filtered through, the technical language and structured analytical \nframeworks used by local authority officers (Healey 1997).  \n \nAs far as most stakeholders are concerned, it then becomes an \nimpenetrable \u2018black box\u2019 of \u2018taken-for-granted\u2019 knowledge (Ibid, 275).   \n \nThe application of people\u2019s deliberations was therefore oriented upwards, to justify or \nvalidate higher policy objectives or mobilise civic support rather than downwards to \nsteer action.  So, as the following extract from one local authority officer highlights, the \nuse of participatory outputs often served a rather symbolic role \u2013 to signal good \ndecision-making without necessarily influencing it (Mosse 2001).  \n \nIf I can be slightly cynical \u2013 they\u2019re (workshops) very useful in keeping \npeople engaged and getting you know getting them involved and getting \nthem on side because they are involved.  What we actually get out of them \nis perhaps of less value than the mere fact that they\u2019re happening [\u2026].  But \nif I was a politician I would say I think the public consultation was excellent. \n 27\n[\u2026] To the politicians the public acceptance of it was very, very important. \n(Transport officer, male) \n \nIt is not surprising, then, that participants across the two case studies were critical of \nthe lack of transparency in the processes of analysis and decision-making or raised \nconcerns about what, if anything, would be done with their recommendations (cf. \nAbelson et al 2003, McIver 1998, Santos and Chess 2003, Seargent and Steele 1999).  \n \n It\u2019s a bit of black box to me, I can see all the bits that went in and I\u2019ve seen \nthe documents at the end but what they did in the middle? (Participant, \nmale, environmental interest) \n \nThe net result was a sense of confusion and frustration - people were unable to judge \nwhether their involvement had made a genuine difference to the decisions made. This \noften led to an interpretation of the process as a manifestation of political rhetoric, with \nparticipation only occurring after politics had defined the problem and to a large degree \nthe solution.  It is noteworthy that Lowndes et al\u2019s (2001b) case study research similarly \nshowed dissatisfied citizens to be preoccupied with a perceived lack of council \nresponse to their concerns and a feeling that councillors and officers did not take them \nseriously.  What we see, then, is a level of ambivalence and ambiguity expressed by \nboth participants and local authority officers (and members) on the direct policy \noutcomes of participation. \n \n 28\nI suppose it\u2019s satisfying to a degree, but then is that the veneer of the thing, \nthat I feel as though I\u2019ve been consulted to a degree.  So maybe this is an \nunholy alliance, the Borough Council, they feel as though they\u2019ve done their \nbit, I feel as though there\u2019s been a consultation bit \u2013 we neither of us feel it \nhas been done as well as it might have been done, but we\u2019re not quite sure \nhow to do it much better.  So we agree that we\u2019ve done it without delving, \nand as soon as you start doing that you get into this thing, is it worth doing \nit, are we just doing it because the government have said we need to. \n(Participant, male, residents\u2019 interest) \n \nRelational outcomes \nThe study of outcomes in much participatory research has tended to focus on the \nimmediate policy or relational impacts of deliberations, with scant attention given to \nwider, longer term citizenship and relational changes (Bickerstaff et al 2002, Burns and \nTaylor 2000, Barnes 1999, Sommer 2000, Kuper 1997, Lowndes et al 2001a).   In this \nsection we consider the often unintended outcomes of participatory processes, \nfocusing specifically on the educative effects of deliberation and changes in citizen-\nlocal authority relationships.  \n \nThe first theme relates to the more intangible, non-policy impacts of participatory \nactivities. Pateman, in the 1970\u2019s, developed the argument that the major function of \nparticipation is an educative one, educative including both a psychological aspect and \nthe gaining of practice in democratic skills and procedures. It is these \u2018softer\u2019 impacts - \n\u2018increased understanding\u2019, \u2018mutual respect\u2019,  'relationship building', 'profile raising' and \n 29\n'getting to know the local community better' (also Beierle and Cayford 2002, Barnes \n1999a, Lowndes et al 2001a, Bickerstaff and Walker 2001) - that dominated discussion \nof outcomes in our interviews.  As one participant commented when asked what he felt \nhad been the main good points of being involved in the LTP deliberations:  \n \nThe people who went through the sessions, there would be some build up \nof networking, we would begin to pick out officers you wouldn\u2019t feel badly \nabout ringing up and saying I\u2019ve got a problem here and I don\u2019t understand \nit and what are you going to do about it and also other groups.  You begin \nto pick out the ones that - with whom you felt you could work cause that\u2019s \nhow change happens (Participant, male, user interest) \n \nSo whilst across the interviews people identified as beneficial the building of links \nbetween citizens and the local authority, such relational impacts do not in and of \nthemselves redress power imbalances and uncover hidden policy networks.  More \nbroadly these knowledge and learning impacts were, for participants, often connected \nto the wider policy process, that is gaining an understanding of the complexities, \ndifficulties and necessary trade-offs linked to local decision-making (see also \nBickerstaff et al 2001, Stewart 1996, Lowndes et al 2001b).  \n \nWhilst these relational impacts can clearly be, and often were, interpreted as beneficial \nthere remain (unintended) problems for the goal of reactivating citizenship and \nredressing power inequalities.  For as Cooke and Kothari (2001) argue such \n\u2018educational\u2019 outcomes may more accurately be viewed as the acquisition and \n 30\nmanipulation of a new professionalized planning knowledge, rather than the \nincorporation of people\u2019s lay knowledge by local authorities. Through participatory \nlearning, it is the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 who acquire this new planning knowledge and learn \nhow to manipulate it (reflected in earlier extracts), thereby serving to widen inequalities \nwithin civic society (see also Mosse 2001, Rydin 2003).  Indeed, for Abelson et al \n(2003) a greater awareness of the harsh realities of making difficult political decisions \nmay mean that participants lose their lay perspective and their views become more \naligned with those of the \u2018professionals\u2019 (247) \u2013 in effect serving as a mechanisms of \npolitical co-option.  In the extract below a councillor reflects on how through repeated \ninvolvement a new professionalized category of participants is being created: \n \nI mean I did find myself going to meetings to engage with the community \nand I found I knew a very large proportion of people I was engaging with \nfrom other places and so there is a danger there that it is not that open a \ncommunity \u2013 it\u2019s a new sort of consultation groupie class or something. \n(Council member, male) \n \nBeyond these softer impacts of participation the research revealed other unintended \nconsequences which could, over the longer term, only add to the already precarious \nposition of civic deliberations within existing democratic systems.   What we repeatedly \nobserved, particularly amongst participants that could be described as the \u2018usual \nsuspects\u2019, was the problem of consultation fatigue or overload (noted by Lowndes \n2001a, IPPR 2004, reported by the House of Commons Public Administration Select \nCommittee 2001, DfT 2004). There were too many overlapping public participation \n 31\nforums, demanding too much time of people (an issue also applicable to council staff) \nand, crucially, with no visible policy outcomes to result.  Many of the key interest \ngroups and their representatives were being overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of \nparticipatory events and the attendant workloads. The net result was a growing sense \nof disaffection and disinclination to take part (IPPR 2004, Copus 2003) \u2013 a situation, \nwhich, if it continues, will erode and further skew what is for most local authorities the \nbedrock of local consultative and deliberative processes. \n \nThe government have gone crazy on plans, people are absolutely \ninundated with plans on every subject under the sun and people are getting \nplan fatigue really.  I think if you have too many of them people just go and \nlose interest and they\u2019re not going to be worth the effort really [\u2026] After the \ntwo meetings I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve sort of thought to myself well I\u2019ve had enough \nof all this I want a rest now. (Participant, male, environmental interest) \n \nYou do get a bit punch drunk you know, in fact I felt I couldn\u2019t, I went to the \nlocal plan one the other evening\u2026 I quite honestly I couldn\u2019t take much \nmore of it you know.  If you\u2019ve got a full time job and you\u2019ve still got to get \nhome afterwards you feel well actually why am I doing this [\u2026]   but in the \nend I suppose I felt that there\u2019s almost too much consultation going on.   \n(Participant, male, civic interest) \n \nCouncil officers and elected members also expressed reservations about the formal \nrequirements for public participation across local government responsibilities - the \n 32\nnumber of repetitive processes on closely related themes, the diminishing number and \nrange of participants taking part (becoming increasingly narrow and exclusive), and a \nlack of local government resources and powers to carry out meaningful deliberation.  In \na comment that demonstrated the involved interplay between pressure on resources \nand concerns about representation and the legitimacy of deliberative processes, one \ncouncillor invoked the vocabulary of \u2018best value\u2019 to rationalise decisions on how much \nto spend on participation:     \n \nThe government attitude has changed and consultation is one of the key \nplanks of the council\u2019s community plan and we consult on all sorts of things.  \nThere again that\u2019s fine but you\u2019ve got to get the balance between \u2013 if you \ngo over the top and spend too much money on consultation, because yes \nwe must consult, but if your consultation is so detailed and so pressure \ngroup focused that you get a distorted view you\u2019re not getting best value - \nso its striking that balance. (Council member, female)  \n \nInstitutional constraints \nIn reflecting on the impacts of participation, interviewees talked about a number of \ninstitutional barriers that related to the inflexibility of representative democracy, the \nobduracy of political cultures and the pre-determination of policy by central \ngovernment.  One persistent theme across the stakeholder interviews reflected the \ndifficult relationship between deliberation and the political priorities and necessities of \nrepresentative government (also Copus 2004).  We observed, specifically in the \ncomments of council officers and members, an underlying reassertion of relations \nbetween the government (the representatives) and the governed (the represented).  In \n 33\nthese, often implicit, remarks we see evidence of political power shaping not only the \nprocess but also the outcomes of participation.  \n \nIt was sold to councillors that it [public participation] wasn\u2019t taking away \ntheir decisions.  It was their job to decide what goes in the Local Transport \nPlan but they would be better informed so that they could look at the fact \nthat the general population was saying this but other people were saying \nthat and then it\u2019s a question of political judgement which way they go. \n(Transport officer, male) \n \nThere can be a feeling that a process that produces a programme by a \ndifferent route than the representative democracy could be in conflict and \ncould undermine your ability to pursue a particular objective (Council \nmember, male) \n  \nThere was a sense, in such comments, that beyond the more directly involved \ncouncillors we spoke to, other council members remained deeply cynical of or felt \nthreatened by the new emphasis on public participation, and were reluctant to engage \nwith local people or to reassess their own role in democratic governance (see also \nCopus 2003, Lowndes et al 2001a, 1999, Leach and Wingfield 1999).  In the context of \nlocal governance, Wilson (1999) points to: \n \n 34\n [A] deeply held view amongst backbench councillors that local democracy \nmeans representative democracy \u2013 hence their desire to marginalize the \nparticipatory democracy agenda (257).  \n \nSo whilst (some) councillors may be supportive of participatory initiatives, their desire \nto retain decision-making power within the existing framework of representative \ndemocracy could, as Copus (2003) has argued, act as a barrier to developing greater \ninvolvement. As one council member we spoke to summarised the problem: \n \nCouncillors, if you\u2019re not careful can get the \u2018anointed not appointed \nsyndrome\u2019 \u2013 you sit here and think well you know best (Council member, \nfemale). \n \nPerhaps the pivotal democratic constraint, repeatedly identified across the interviews, \nwas the practical workings of decision-making. Government guidance in this arena has, \nfor instance, been criticized as too prescriptive, reflecting \u201can excessive focus on \ntargets and ticks in boxes\u201d (DfT 2004, 8). So, in a policy arena strongly shaped by \nnational political concerns and objectives, local authority powers to influence anything \nbut the most superficial aspects of the form and content of LTP\u2019s were heavily \ncircumscribed. This underlying structural problem in large part precedes the issue of \nlocal political commitment to public participation.  In this light, public involvement in the \nLTP process was repeatedly seen as having little if any agency - a matter of tampering \nat the edges of decisions essentially made.  For instance, one officer talked about how \nthe shift in New Labour policy on road building - from an early pledge to reduce road \n 35\nbuild to the later encouragement of new schemes (subsequent to public participation) - \nhad played a significant role on the content and specifically funding of the final plan.   \n \n[S]omething about the bypass schemes, it\u2019s only really that the government \nhave completely changed their views \nInterviewer: In the provisional round were the major schemes \naccepted? \nNo, in fact [the bypass scheme] was slated, they said we never want to see \nit submitted ever again, it was as strong as that you know: for a government \noffice to say something like that and then they turned round. I think they\u2019ve \nhad word from above \u2013 they want to build some bypasses.  I have to say \nour director and politicians all said we want it to go back in again.  If it had \nbeen my decision after last year I\u2019d of said you\u2019re wasting your time putting \nit back. (Transport officer, male) \n \nImportantly, the extract, taken alongside the member comment below, highlights the \nmultiple, often competing, pressures which act upon and shape decision-making:  \npolitical group affiliation (members), professional independence (officers), serving or \nrepresenting the community and, crucially, central government objectives. \n \nGovernment guidance, political imperatives and then public opinion. Yeah, \nyou\u2019ve got the three legs of the stool I suppose, you\u2019ve got to balance them \nto try and keep the stool on an even keel as it were with the three legs.  In a \nway you could argue the more information you get the harder it is \u2013 all the \n 36\npaper\u2019s piling on top of the stool as it were, and the higher that paper is the \nmore wobbly the legs are likely to be \u2013 the more  sensitive it is to be upset. \nYou know if you haven\u2019t got much information and you just look at the \npolitical imperative, you just look at what your party policy is on something. \n(Council member, male) \n \nTaken together these comments highlight the tensions that underpin representative \ndemocracy and simultaneously reveal areas of tension in relations between members \nand officers in the interpretation of participatory outputs (cf. Copus 2003, Tewdr-Jones \nand Thomas 1998, Tait and Campbell 200; DfT 2004).   \n \nThe constraints of statutory (or institutional) requirements and limitations, and the \nresulting narrow parameters set for debate, have been documented by researchers \nacross a number of public policy and development fields (Beierle and Cayford 2002, \nPetts 2001, Barnes 1999b, Lowndes et al 2001a,  McGuirk 2001, Martin and Boaz \n2000, Tewdwer Jones and Thomas 1998, Cooke and Kothari 2001).  In the context of \nlocal transport planning, and reflected in the comments of both officers and members, \nthe prescriptive nature of government guidance has led to concern that the public may \nidentify priorities that conflict with government objectives - raising questions over the \nvalidity of engagement processes if they cannot genuinely feed through into decision-\nmaking (also DfT 2004). \n \n \n \n 37\nConclusion \nIn researching the practice of participation in local transport planning we have situated \nthe achievements and failures of deliberative activities in relation to the wider political \nlandscape of power and decision-making. Our analytical focus has thus come not from \nnormative models of communicative rationality or discursive democracy, but rather \nfrom the theoretical and practical criticisms that have been levelled at this collective \nbody of work.  Accordingly our evaluative framework has avoided the mechanistic \nassessment of the specific process and\/or outcomes of particular exercises prevalent \nin much participation evaluation. Instead we have adopted a grounded approach, \nbringing together the reflections of all stakeholder groups, accessed at some distance \nfrom the participatory experience and after policy decisions have been realised.  Whilst \nthere are inevitably some methodological limitations, such as the potential for \nselectivity of recall by interviewees and \u2018reinterpretation with hindsight\u2019, we would argue \nthat this particular approach to researching participation is necessary if a more \nsophisticated and reflexive understanding of the manifestations and dynamics of power \nin the implementation of the current participatory agenda in the UK is to be achieved.  \n \nWhilst we have investigated only two examples of the use of extended and deliberative \nprocesses within one sphere of local governance, and although the two case studies \ndiffered in a number of respects, the participants, officers and councillors we \ninterviewed do highlight some generic questions and complexities about the processes \nthey had been engaged in and struggled with.  At the heart of some of these tensions \naround issues of inclusion, consultation fatigue, power inequalities, and the dearth of \npractical outcomes, lies the difficult and unresolved linkages between representative \n 38\nand participatory governance. What is the \u2018democratic\u2019 balance to be struck between \nformal politics and civil society, informing and listening to the public, professional and \nlay expertise, conflict and consensus? These are tensions that have not been \nadequately grappled with in policy arenas.  Rather, what we have seen in the intense \npolitical and academic activity around participation over the last decade has been a \ndisproportionate focus on innovation in process and method with a lack of attention to \nthe thornier questions surrounding impacts - particularly in terms of institutional design \nand structures of democratic decision-making.  \n \nIf we first take the analysis of aspects of process and the discourse space, our \nresearch revealed general perceptions of participation initiatives as dominated by \nparticular and forceful interests (civic, business or institutional) or that these interests \nserved to co-opt and neuter any dissenting or oppositional voices \u2013 reinforcing a \ndistinctly unequal set of power relations.  In terms of the participants, we have pointed \nto a range of strategies and tactics that participants and groups used to influence or to \nbypass the so-called consensus position \u2013 in some cases even before entering the \ndeliberative forum.  In this sense, more participation is clearly not the same thing as \nmore democracy - and can in fact reproduce or even exacerbate existing patterns of \nsocial exclusion and disadvantage (cf. Wilson 1999).  We need, then, to move away \nfrom the concepts of inclusivity and rational consensus in the Habermasian sense, \nwhich ignore the permanence of conflict, inequality, and domination, and turn instead to \nsomething more akin to Mouffe\u2019s agonistic model of democracy (1999).  In this way \nparticipation and, in particular, establishing the democratic value of civic deliberations \nmust recognise that decision-making involves conflict and partiality, and that attention \n 39\nto power relations and difference necessitates the acceptance of unresolvable \ndisagreements (Jasanoff 1996) and some forms of exclusion (McGuirk 2001).  Dryzeck \n(1996) has argued that this is a necessary feature of healthy democracy, as a truly \ninclusive state corrodes the vitality of civil society through a destructive process of co-\noption. \n \nFor the participants we interviewed, perhaps the key tensions centred not on process \nbut on policy outcomes and the lack of direct, observable and substantial policy \nimpacts resulting from their involvement in deliberative exercises. Many interviewees \nrecognised the value of more ambiguous relationship-building and learning impacts, \nbut the very fact that these softer impacts dominated discussion of outcomes, \nreinforced the lack of direct influence seen as achievable or possible upon harder \npolicy decisions.  Indeed soft impacts can be emphasised largely because of the \nimpossibility of more substantial outcomes being achieved (Stewart 1996). \nFurthermore, and as we have suggested, such impacts can be interpreted as the \nacquisition of planning knowledge by an elite citizenry of the \u2018usual suspects\u2019 - and \npotentially a political mechanism of circumventing opposition - rather than the local \nauthority developing an understanding of people\u2019s knowledge or delegating powers to \ncitizens.  Our analysis also revealed a failure on the part of authorities to set \ninvolvement in a transparent framework of outputs and outcomes (also DfT 2004). \nIndeed, the officers\u2019 interpretations of participatory materials, and specifically \ndeliberations, underlined the predominance of deeply entrenched practices of elite \ndecision-making or planning knowledge. As we have shown, the new methods of \nworking with the public presented significant challenges to elected officials who often \n 40\nbelieved it was their duty (and right) to represent their citizens (and not to involve them) \nor to those whose professional training taught them to separate themselves from those \nto whom they provide services (see also Barnes 1999a, Copus 2003, Tait and \nCampbell 2000). In addition, and as particularly those participants working within the \nlocal authority emphasised, the LTP was shaped by statutory requirements and \nlimitations \u2013 the Realpolitik and Realrationalit\u00e4t (Flyvbjerg 1998a) of local transport \nplanning.  Fundamentally, the final plan had to conform to government guidance (cf. \nTewdwr-Jones and Allmendinger 1998, Tewdwr-Jones and Thomas 1998, Petts 2001).  \nUnder these circumstances, what Copus (2003) has described as \u2018crises of \nrepresentation\u2019 become all too possible and likely.  In other words tensions arise for \ncouncil members and officers regarding the competing demands of the community \n(expressed through engagement processes) and those of central government or party \naffiliation \u2013 an inconsistency which is intensified by government ambitions to see \ngreater citizen engagement in local government. \n \nConsistent with political analyses that have emerged across a range of settings where \nparticipatory activities have flourished in recent years, our findings support the view \nthat civic deliberations are failing to deliver significant changes in prevailing practices of \nlocal transport planning and more widely local government.  In effect the formal \nplanning system still controls access to decision-making processes. In this light, the \npatterns of consultation fatigue and a disinclination to become involved we have \nidentified are not altogether surprising. Although this disjunction between the rhetoric of \nopen exploratory interaction and the practice of a more constrained and closed mode \nof engagement may not be intentional, it does raise the danger that new forms of \n 41\ndeliberative democracy are providing something of a legitimatory veneer over existing \nrelations of power within and between institutions and civic society (Hajer and \nKesselring 1999).  So rather than providing for the possibility of a radical challenge to \nexisting power structures, professional positions and knowledge systems, these civic \ndeliberations emerge as more or less compatible with traditional top-down decision-\nmaking processes (see also Cooke and Kothari 2001, Rydin 2003, Pickard 1998) and \nin their current form can be interpreted as part of a system of domination rather than \nemancipation. As Pl\u00f8ger (2001) has argued the formal and informal aspects of power \nprevent a fulfilment of public participation based on the power of citizens or the \nempowerment of weak groups, in the sense of Habermasian communicative rationality. \n \nIn these examples taken from local transport planning the arenas of national and local \npolitical concerns emerge as critical to understanding the problematic functioning of \nparticipatory activities in the context of actual impacts.  Public involvement is not, to \ndate, allowing change of the procedural system itself or contesting the power of these \nsystems or the expert discourses that underpin them. Rather, what we are witnessing \nis a \u2018jarring\u2019 between the ideals of participatory democracy and the realities of \nrepresentative democracy.  Unless and until the current political enthusiasm for \nparticipatory activities is matched by genuine processes of institutional reflexivity and \nchange, centring on the structures and practices of democratic decision making, then \nthe impacts in terms of reinvigorating civic society and empowering citizens will be \nminimal.  It may even be the case that the participatory turn in local governance is \nactually serving, in the longer term at least, to de-activate rather than reactivate \ncitizenship, further skewing the civic contribution to local decision-making.  \n 42\nIn practical terms these insights point to real weaknesses in formal approaches \ncurrently being developed and applied to evaluate new modes of participatory \ndemocracy.   Much of this activity adopts a position of technical revisionism based on \ncriteria drawn from Habermasian ideals.  Yet as Santos and Chess (2003) argue, in a \nrecent participant-centred evaluation of two citizen advisory boards, evaluation \nframeworks based on communicative rationality are inherently problematic.   Drawing \non participant criteria, derived from observation and interviews conducted with a range \nof different stakeholders, they stress not only the importance of outcomes but also the \nway relations of power influence the process and outcomes of participation.   In this \nsense we would support the call they make for: \n \n[F]uture research efforts to better understand [\u2026]  how power is distributed \namong participants in a participatory process and the corresponding impact \nof power on the process (Ibid, 278).  \n \nIf researching new mechanisms is to meaningfully examine their contribution to \ndemocratic practice, this work will need to better account for the political settings and \ncultures in which participatory processes becomes embedded, the relations of power \nthat are brought into deliberative fora (and how far they map onto or challenge existing \nrelational inequalities), how these relations are worked through and incorporated into \ndeliberative outputs and the extent to which real changes in the practices and \noutcomes of decision-making can be traced to deliberative outputs.   Centrally, efforts \nneed to move away from an emphasis on the goal of achieving some kind of equality of \nvoice and consensual agreements, to a recognition of the politics of participation \u2013 \n 43\nwhich encompasses both relations (and relational changes) inside and outside the \ndeliberative fora.  So, whilst we would not dismiss efforts which have emphasised the \nfairness and competence of process, we believe that until more basic questions \nregarding the distribution of political power and the institutional capacity for democratic \nchange are addressed then evaluation will remain at best limited at worst deceptive in \nits conclusions.  \n \nAcknowledgements.
