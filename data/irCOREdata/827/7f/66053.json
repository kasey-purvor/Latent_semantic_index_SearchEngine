The article concludes that, in order\nto maintain integrity or generalisability, future welfare state typologies need to reflect more\nadequately the role of services in welfare state provision.\nIntroduction\nWelfare state modelling has long been a preoccupation of comparative social\npolicy (Wilensky and Lebraux, 1958; Titmuss, 1974; Therborn, 1987; Esping-\nAndersen, 1990; Castles and Mitchell, 1993). Recently, the literature has been\ndominated by the extensive, and on-going, debate that has surrounded Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s influential analysis of welfare state decommodification and the\nresulting \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology (Esping-Andersen, 1990, 1999; Lewis,\n1992; Leibfried, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994;\nDaly, 1994; Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Goodin\net al., 1999; Sainsbury, 1994, 1999; Abrahamson, 1999; Pitruzzello, 1999; Arts and\nGelissen, 2002; Kasza, 2002). However, what is remarkable about this debate is\nthat, while there are numerous critiques about his range (Leibfried, 1992; Castles\nand Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997), his methodology (Kangas, 1994;\nRagin, 1994; Pitruzzello, 1999) and the absence of gender in his typology\n196 clare bambra\n(Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Sainsbury, 1994, 1999; Bambra, 2004a), core procedures\nhave attracted less attention: the analytical focus on cash benefits (Alber, 1995;\nAbrahamson, 1999; Kautto, 2002; Bambra, 2005) and the creation of regimes that\ngeneralise about all forms of social policy provision from this base (Kasza, 2002).\nThis ignores the fact that welfare states are also about the actual delivery of\nservices, such as health, education or social care, and that, far from being internally\nconsistent, countries vary in terms of the relative emphasis that they place upon\ncash benefits and\/or welfare state services (Korpi and Palme, 1998; Castles, 1998;\nKautto, 2002). Indeed, welfare services may well account for the greatest differen-\nces both between and within countries\u2019 welfare state arrangements (Castles, 1998).\nHealth care is by far the largest area of welfare state service delivery,\naccounting as it does for an average of 6.6 per cent of GDP in the EU member\nstates (Eurostat, 2001). Although it has been subject to extensive separate com-\nparative analysis (Ham, 1997; Moran, 1999, 2000; Freeman and Moran, 2000;\nFreeman, 2000), health care has been a significant and notable omission from\nthe broader welfare state literature and particularly the regimes debate (Bambra,\n2005). However, as some commentators such as Ginsburg (1992) and Moran\n(1999) have suggested, it is a strong example of internal welfare state inconsistency\nin the provision of cash benefits and welfare services. They assert that there is a\nsignificant difference between the principles behind the UK\u2019s market-orientated\ncash benefit programmes and its state-dominated health care provision. This\ndiscrepancy has also been touched upon in exploratory research by the author\non the health care provision of different welfare states (Bambra, 2005). This\narticle takes such analysis further by examining in depth the cash and services\nmix in, and between, welfare states through the detailed comparison of the\ndecommodification levels of the main cash benefits (pensions, sickness and\nunemployment) with the main area of service provision: health care.\nThe article proceeds with a brief outline of Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds\nof welfare\u2019 thesis and the subsequent debate that has emerged around it. It then\ndiscusses the concept of decommodification and presents an updated version\nof Esping-Andersen\u2019s cash benefit decommodification index and a similarly\nconstructed health care services index. The results of these two indexes are\ncompared and used to explore the internal and external diversity of countries\u2019\ncash benefit and welfare service arrangements, and what they mean for the \u2018three\nworlds of welfare\u2019 and welfare state modelling.\nThe \u2018Three Worlds of Welfare\u2019\nIn The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism, Esping-Andersen argues that \u2018existing\ntheoretical models of the welfare state are inadequate\u2019 (1990: 2) as their analysis\nrelies too heavily upon the misleading comparison of aggregate welfare state\nexpenditure. The focus on total expenditure figures conceals the variety of state\napproaches to welfare as, \u2018even if the lion\u2019s share of expenditure or personnel\ncash versus services 197\nTABLE 1. The three worlds of welfare.\nLiberal Conservative Social Democratic\nAustralia Austria Denmark\nCanada Belgium Finland\nIreland France Norway\nNew Zealand Germany Sweden\nUK Italy\nUSA Japan\nNetherlands\nSwitzerland\nSource: adapted from Esping-Andersen, 1990: 52.\nserves welfare aims, the kind of welfare provided will be qualitatively different,\nas will its prioritisation relative to competing activities\u2019 (1990: 1). He asserts that\nit is therefore more beneficial to focus upon what a welfare state does, rather\nthan how much money it is afforded. On this basis, Esping-Andersen (1990:\n52) presents a three-fold typology of welfare state regimes based largely on the\nprinciple of labour market decommodification: Liberal, Conservative and Social\nDemocratic (see Table 1).\nIn the welfare states of the Liberal regime (UK, USA, Ireland, Canada,\nAustralia), state provision of welfare is minimal, benefits are modest and often\nattract strict entitlement criteria, and recipients are usually means-tested and\nstigmatised (Esping-Andersen, 1990: 26). In this model, the dominance of the\nmarket is encouraged both passively, by guaranteeing only a minimum, and\nactively, by subsidising private welfare schemes (ibid: 27). The Liberal welfare\nstate regime thereby minimises the decommodification effects of state welfare\nand a stark division exists between those, largely the poor, who rely on state aid\nand those who are able to afford private provision.\nThe Conservative welfare state regime (Germany, France, Austria, Belgium,\nItaly and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands) is distinguished by its \u2018status\ndifferentiating\u2019 welfare programmes in which benefits are often earnings-related,\nadministered through the employer, and geared towards maintaining existing\nsocial patterns. The role of the family is also emphasised and the redistributive\nimpact is minimal. However, the role of the market is marginalised, and therefore\nEsping-Andersen places it between the low decommodifying Liberal regime and\nthe highly decommodifying Social Democratic regime (1990: 27).\nThe \u2018third world of welfare\u2019, the Social Democratic (Nordic countries), is the\nclearly the smallest regime cluster. Its provision is characterised by universal and\ncomparatively generous benefits, a commitment to full employment and income\nprotection, and a strongly interventionist state. The state is used to promote\nsocial equality through a redistributive social security system. Unlike the other\nwelfare state regimes, the Social Democratic regime type \u2018promotes an equality\n198 clare bambra\nof the highest standards, not an equality of minimal needs\u2019 and it provides \u2018a\nmix of highly decommodifying and universalistic programs\u2019 (Esping-Andersen,\n1990: 28).\nThe \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019 debate\nThis \u2018three worlds\u2019 typology has sparked a volatile and ongoing debate (Sainsbury,\n1999; Goodin et al., 1999; Pitruzzello, 1999; Arts and Gelissen, 2002; Kasza, 2002)\nand, indeed, much of the burgeoning comparative welfare state literature since\n1990 can be seen as a \u2018settling of accounts\u2019 with Esping-Andersen (Pierson, 1998:\n175). This debate has been dominated by three principle critiques: the range\n(Leibfried, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997), the\nmethodology (Kangas, 1994; Ragin, 1994; Pitruzzello, 1999) and the omission\nof gender in the analysis (Lewis, 1992; Orloff, 1993; Borchost, 1994; Daly, 1994,\nSainsbury, 1999). Two other critiques of the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology,\nand indeed of welfare state modelling as a whole, have been less prominent: the\nusefulness of the regimes concept (Kasza, 2002) and the focus on cash benefits\n(Alber, 1995; Abrahamson, 1999; Kautto, 2002).\nThe limited range\nThe range of countries used to construct Esping-Andersen\u2019s typology has met\nwith criticism (Leibfried, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli,\n1997). Leibfried (1992), Ferrera (1996) and Bonoli (1997) assert that a distinctive\nfourth type of welfare state regime is emerging in the countries of the Latin rim\nof the European Union (Spain, Portugal, Greece and, to a lesser extent, Italy).\nLeibfried (1992) describes these welfare states as \u2018rudimentary\u2019 because they are\ncharacterised by their fragmented system of welfare provision, which consists of\ndiverse cash benefit schemes that range from the meagre to the generous, and a\nhealth care system that provides only limited and partial coverage.\nCastles and Mitchell (1993) similarly challenge the notion that there are only\nthree worlds of welfare. They cross-classify the same 18 OECD nations used by\nEsping-Andersen and examine their high and low aggregate expenditure levels,\nand their high and low degrees of benefit equality. On the basis of this analysis,\nthey claim that a fourth, \u2018radical\u2019, world of welfare should be added to the thesis\n(Castles and Mitchell, 1993: 107). They argue that the UK, Australia and New\nZealand constitute a \u2018radical\u2019 form of welfare state regime, one in which \u2018the\nwelfare goals of poverty amelioration and income equality are pursued through\nredistributive instruments rather than by high expenditure levels\u2019 (Castles and\nMitchell, 1993: 107).\nThe methodological approach\nA more general methodological critique of Esping-Andersen has been\ndeveloped through the use of cluster analysis. Kangas (1994) performed a cluster\nanalysis of indicators of sickness insurance for the same 18 OECD countries. The\ncash versus services 199\nresults broadly confirmed Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds\u2019 thesis, although the\nexistence of a coherent Liberal regime was questioned: no clear Liberal regime\ncluster was identified as, while the UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia\nwere merged together, the USA and Canada were separate outliers. However,\na more comprehensive cluster analysis (Pitruzello, 1999) of all three of Esping-\nAndersen\u2019s decommodification factors (sickness, pensions and unemployment)\nrevealed a number of significant discrepancies. Pitruzzello\u2019s research showed\nsignificant support for the existence and distinctiveness of welfare regimes, but it\nchallenged the empirical accuracy of the \u2018three worlds\u2019 typology: the antipodes\nwere identified as a distinctive fourth cluster and a sub-group of the corporatist\ncluster emerged. This suggested that there could be four or five \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019\n(Pitruzello, 1999: 23\u201350).\nThe gender blind \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019\nThis is perhaps the most developed and influential critique of the \u2018three\nworlds of welfare\u2019 (Esping-Andersen, 1999; Bambra, 2004). Feminist comment-\nators (such as Lewis, 1992; Borchost, 1994; Bussemaker and Kersbergen, 1994;\nDaly, 1994; Hobson, 1994; Lewis and Ostner, 1995; Sainsbury, 1994, 1999) have\nargued that Esping-Andersen\u2019s \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology is deeply flawed\nbecause it marginalised women in its analysis. Aside from the overt absence of\nwomen in Esping-Andersen\u2019s analysis, the critique revolves around three other\nissues: the gender blind concept of decommodification (Daly, 1994; Hobson,\n1994; Lewis, 1992), the unawareness of the role of women and the family in\nthe provision of welfare (Borchost, 1994; Bussemaker and Kersbergen, 1994;\nDaly, 1994), and the lack of consideration given to gender as a form of social\nstratification (Bussemaker and Kersbergen, 1994). These criticisms have in turn\nled to both theoretical attempts to \u2018gender\u2019 Esping-Andersen\u2019s analysis (for\nexample, Orloff, 1993; O\u2019Connor, 1993), and the construction of alternative\nwelfare state typologies in which gender has been a more overt and centralised\npart of the analysis (for example, Lewis, 1992; Lewis and Ostner, 1995; Sainsbury,\n1999). These alternative typologies, although often flawed themselves (Esping-\nAndersen, 1999), have undermined confidence in the comprehensiveness and\ngeneralisability of the \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 thesis, especially in respect to any\nclaims about women, welfare and the family.\nThe \u2018illusion\u2019 of welfare state regimes\nKasza (2002) has questioned the validity of the regimes concept itself. He\nargues that the concept of welfare regimes incorporates two flawed assumptions:\nfirstly, that most of the key social policy areas, such as income maintenance (cash\nbenefits), education, health or housing, within a welfare regime will reflect a\nsimilar, across the board, approach to welfare provision; and, secondly, that each\nregime type itself reflects \u2018a set of principles or values that establishes a coherence\n200 clare bambra\nin each country\u2019s welfare package\u2019 (Kasza, 2002: 272). Kasza asserts that instead\nof an internal policy homogeneity or cohesion, welfare states and welfare regimes\nexhibit significant variation across different areas of social provision. He asserts\nthat the regime concept therefore \u2018does not capture the complex motives that\ninform each country\u2019s welfare programs\u2019 and, in pursuit of consistency, it ignores\nthe fact that different areas of welfare state provision exhibit different cross-\nnational variations. Kasza\u2019s critique has been shown to be particularly applicable\nto health care (Bambra, 2005) although it is not without its own limitations\n(Bambra, 2004a).\nThe dominance of cash over services\nThis critique focuses on Esping-Andersen\u2019s decision to organise the principle\nof classification around the study of cash benefit programmes (Alber, 1995;\nAbrahamson, 1999; Kautto, 2002). The \u2018three worlds of welfare\u2019 typology is\nlargely based on a comparison of the decommodification of three cash benefit\nprogrammes: pensions, sickness benefits and unemployment benefits. This\nignores the fact that welfare states are also about the actual delivery of services,\nsuch as education, health or social services (Kautto, 2002). It is suggested that\ncountries vary in terms of the emphasis that they place upon welfare state\nservices and\/or social transfers: the Social Democratic welfare states have high\nspending on both cash benefits and welfare services; the Conservative countries\nare more inclined to fund cash benefits than welfare services; and the Liberal\ncountries are divided into two sub-groups, one that is prepared to spend a little\nmore on services and the other that is consistently low in all forms of social\nexpenditure (Castles, 1998). These differences are not adequately reflected in\nEsping-Andersen\u2019s typology.\nThe later two critiques have been less extensively explored both empirically\nand within the regimes debate. This article will now examine what they may mean\nfor the \u2018welfare modeling business\u2019 (Abrahamson, 1999) and the construction of\ntypologies through the detailed comparison of a more up-to-date reconstruction\nof Esping-Andersen\u2019s decommodification index with a current index of health\ncare services decommodification.\nDecommodification\nIt is important to acknowledge the importance of going beyond aggregate\nmeasures of welfare and so, in comparing the relative role of cash benefits and\nwelfare services, the concept of decommodification, as pioneered in comparative\nwelfare research by Esping-Andersen, has been kept. Decommodification refers\nto \u2018the extent to which individuals and families can maintain a normal and\nsocially acceptable standard of living regardless of their market performance\u2019\n(Esping-Andersen, 1987: 86). Commodification, on the other hand, refers to the\ncash versus services 201\nextent to which workers and their families are reliant upon the market sale of their\nlabour. Labour became extensively commodified during the industrial revolution\nas workers became entirely dependent upon the market for their survival (Esping-\nAndersen, 1990: 21). In the twentieth century, the introduction of social rights\nthat entailed entitlement to social welfare brought about a \u2018loosening\u2019 of the pure\ncommodity status of labour. The welfare state decommodified labour because\ncertain services and a certain standard of living became a right of citizenship and\nreliance on the market for survival decreased (1990: 22). However, it must be noted\nthat under capitalism, while the pure commodification of labour is possible, its\npure decommodification is not (O\u2019Connor, 1993: 61). The issue is therefore the\nrelative degrees of protection from dependence on the labour market provided by\nthe welfare state in the form of cash benefits. When extended to cover health care\nprovision, decommodification refers to the extent to which an individual\u2019s access\nto health care is dependent upon their market position and the extent to which\na country\u2019s provision of health is independent from the market (Bambra, 2005).\nDecommodification indexes\nThe cash benefit and health care decommodification indexes are constructed\nin the same way as Esping-Andersen\u2019s original indexes (Esping-Andersen, 1990:\n54; Bambra, 2004a, b, 2005) even though this methodology has met with some\ncriticism within the literature (Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas, 1994; Ragin,\n1994; Pitruzello, 1999). It is important to replicate Esping-Andersen\u2019s method to\nensure compatibility and comparability.\nCountries\nThe decommodification indexes include the same 18 OECD countries used\nby Esping-Andersen in the 1980s: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,\nFinland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the USA.\nData and sources\nThe data used to compile the indexes relate to the years 1997, 1998 and\n1999. The majority of data that have been used are of an international nature\n(such as that published by the Eurostat, UN or the OECD). The international\nnature of these data has helped to minimise any cross-national differences over\ntheir measurement, definition and collection. These measures should ensure data\ncomparability both between countries and between Esping-Andersen\u2019s original\nindex and the ones in this article.\nMeasures\nThe cash benefits decommodification index is based on the assessment of a\nnumber of factors relating to the three main cash benefit programmes: pensions,\n202 clare bambra\nTABLE 2.

On the basis of the values on each of these four indicators\nfor the 18 nations, a score of one for low decommodification, two for medium\nand three for high decommodification was given. Following Esping-Andersen,\nthe classification into three scores has been done on the basis of one standard\ndeviation from the mean, with adjustment where necessary for extreme outliers\n(1990: 54). These individual factor scores are then added together to get a final\nscore which is then weighted by factor five \u2013 the percentage of the (relevant)\npopulation covered by the programme. In line with Esping-Andersen\u2019s approach\nand his concern for the importance of replacement rates, these variables have been\ngiven extra weight (multiplied by the factor of two) in each index. Finally, the\nresults of these three separate indexes \u2013 pension, unemployment and sickness \u2013\nhave been combined to give the overall cash benefits decommodification score\nfor each country (see Tables 5, 6, and 7) (Bambra, 2004b).\nThe process of scoring in the health care decommodification index is\nidentical: the numerical description of the relationship of an individual country\u2019s\n204\nc\nl\na\nr\ne\nb\na\nm\nb\nr\na\nTABLE 5.

These individual factor scores are then added\ntogether to get a final score which is then weighted by factor three \u2013 the percentage\nof the population covered by the health care system on the basis of 100 per cent\ncoverage providing a weighting of 10, 92 per cent coverage a weighting of 9.2\nand so on (see Table 8). Coverage is used as a weight because, as with the use\nof coverage\/take-up rate in the cash benefit decommodification index, it is the\nmost important issue for public health care systems. A health care system that\nhas a high proportion of public funding and provision but that only provides\nservice access to a small proportion of the population cannot be regarded as\nhighly decommodifying.\nResults\nIn order to meaningfully compare the results of the two different indexes,\nthe different index scales have been equalised (see Table 4). The individual\ncountry score for each index has been translated into a percentage of the total\ndecommodification score produced by that index.

Decommodification of cash benefits compared with health care services.\nunadjusted cash benefits decommodification score was 31.5 and its health care\nservices score was 39.8, but when adjusted and expressed as a percentage of the\ntotal decommodification in the respective index they are 6.8 and 5.8.\nThe cash benefits index shows a wide variety of scores from 2.9 (Australia) to\n7.5 (Sweden). The health services index has a similar spread with scores ranging\nfrom the outlier score of 1.4 (USA) to 9.0 (Norway and UK). Some countries\nhave very similar scores in both the cash benefits and health care services indexes:\nAustralia scores 2.9 for cash benefit decommodification and 2.9 for health care\nservices decommodification, Canada and Italy both score 6.0 for cash benefits\nand 5.8 for health care services. Other countries have very divergent scores with\neither cash benefits or health care services exhibiting higher decommodification\nlevels. For example, Germany scores 6.0 for cash benefits but only 4.0 for health\ncare services, whereas the UK scores only 3.3 for cash benefits and 8.8 for health\ncare services.\nThese differences in internal decommodification scores can be more\nadequately explored by plotting the countries\u2019 cash benefit decommodification\nscores against their health care services decommodification score (Figure 1).\nFigure 1 also demonstrates the inter-relationships of the countries and\nhow they divide into five groupings based on their above\/below average scores\n(depicted by the cross-hairs). The first group of countries (Finland, Norway and\nSweden) score highly in both cash benefit and health service decommodification.\nThe second group of countries (Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands)\nscore more highly on cash benefits decommodification; and the third group of\ncountries (Ireland, New Zealand and the UK) score more highly on health care\nservice decommodification. The fourth group of countries (Australia, Japan and\ncash versus services 209\nthe USA) have low scores for both cash benefit and health service decommodi-\nfication. The decommodification scores of the fifth group of countries (Austria,\nBelgium, Canada, Denmark, France and Italy) are very close to the index average\nfor both cash benefits and health care services.\nDiscussion\nThese results suggest that there is significant internal diversity within the welfare\nstate arrangements of some countries. Ireland, New Zealand and the UK all\nhave higher decommodification scores for health care services than would be\nexpected from their \u2018Liberal\u2019 regime cash benefits score. Similarly, Germany, the\nNetherlands and Switzerland score lower for health care than would be expected\nfrom their \u2018Conservative\u2019 cash benefit score. This indicates that certain welfare\nstates do vary internally in terms of the emphasis that they place upon different\ntypes of social provision, with some focusing on cash benefits and others on\nwelfare services (Korpi and Palme, 1998; Castles, 1998; Kautto, 2002). Therefore\nit cannot be assumed that a country\u2019s approach to one aspect of welfare state\nprovision can be generalised to explain all others (Kasza, 2002: 284; Bambra,\n2005). However, the results also show that some countries are more consistent in\ntheir approach to welfare state provision. Most notably, the Social Democratic\ncountries score similarly above average for cash benefits and health care services,\nand the USA, Japan and Australia score similarly low.\nMore significantly, the comparison of the two indexes also raises more\nquestions about the differences between countries and the number of different\ntypes of welfare state regimes (Leibfried, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Kangas,\n1994; Ragin, 1994; Ferrera, 1996; Bonoli, 1997; Pitruzzello, 1999). The comparison\nsuggests that there are five possible welfare state groupings when cash benefits\nand health care services are compared with one another. The composition of\nthe high scoring group \u2013 Finland, Norway, Sweden \u2013 reflects a tenant of welfare\nregime theory: the existence of a distinctive Scandinavian regime that provides\nconsistently high levels of provision (Titmuss, 1974; Therborn, 1987; Esping-\nAndersen, 1990; Leibfried, 1992; Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Ferrera, 1996;\nBonoli, 1997; Korpi and Palme, 1998; Esping-Andersen, 1999; Sainsbury, 1999;\nKorpi, 2000). The position of countries such as Germany, Switzerland and the\nNetherlands, to some extent reflects comments that the Conservative regime\ncountries tend to place more emphasis upon cash benefits in their welfare mix\n(Castles, 1998), and the division of the Liberal regime countries \u2013 Australia,\nCanada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA \u2013 into two distinctive\ngroups, one that is consistently low in welfare decommodification and one that\nis more service orientated, gives credence to claims about a fourth \u2013 radical (for\nexample, Castles and Mitchell, 1993) \u2013 world of welfare that is a sub-type of the\nLiberal regime.\n210 clare bambra\nThe identification of two additional groupings, sub-regimes, within the\nConservative and Liberal \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019, suggests that welfare services in these\ncountries are based upon different, politically structured, principles from their\nrespective cash benefit programmes. The Conservative sub-group countries \u2013\nGermany, Switzerland and the Netherlands \u2013 all score more highly on cash\nbenefits than welfare services, and the Liberal sub-group countries \u2013 Ireland, New\nZealand and the UK \u2013 all score more highly on services than cash benefits. The\nimbalance within these countries\u2019 welfare mix perhaps reflects Kasza\u2019s assertions\nthat welfare policy making is politically inconsistent and disjointed. He asserts\nthat the cumulative nature of welfare policy making \u2013 the diverse histories of\ndifferent policy areas, the variation of policy actors across different fields, dif-\nferences in the policy-making process and the influence on policy of foreign\nwelfare models \u2013 all undermine the likelihood of a coherent approach to welfare\nprovision within a country (Kasza, 2002). These differences would be particularly\napparent in a comparison of such diverse aspects of welfare policy as cash benefits\nand health care services which, as Kasza points out, aside from a common\nnormative role in satisfying human need, have very little in common with one\nanother. However, it should also be noted that, in contrast to Kasza\u2019s overall con-\nclusion that welfare states are too internally inconsistent to validate the regimes\nconcept, the majority of the 18 countries analysed in this article have shown con-\nsistency in their cash benefits and welfare services mix. It is perhaps therefore the\ncase that certain countries, such as Sweden on the one hand or the USA on the\nother, are more cohesive and uniform in their welfare state construction and\nthe political philosophy behind it, than others, such as the UK or Germany, that\ndemonstrate a more fragmented approach to cash benefits and welfare services.\nConclusions\nThis examination of the cash versus services mix of welfare state arrangements \u2013\nthrough the comparison of decommodification levels of cash benefit programmes\nand health care services \u2013 has highlighted the importance of welfare services.\nIn demonstrating significant internal inconsistency within some countries\u2019\nprovision of cash benefits and health care services, this article has reinforced\nand expanded the findings of earlier research on health care decommodification\n(Bambra, 2005) as well as Kasza\u2019s more general critique of the \u2018illusory\u2019 nature of\nwelfare state regimes (Kasza, 2002). More significantly, though, the inclusion of\nservices has suggested that welfare states divide into not three (Esping-Andersen,\n1990, 1999), or four (Castles and Mitchell, 1993; Korpi and Palme, 1998; Korpi,\n2000; Bambra, 2005), but five different clusters (Pitzurello, 1999): (1) Finland,\nNorway, Sweden; (2) Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland; (3) Australia, Japan,\nUSA; (4) Ireland, New Zealand, UK; (5) Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark,\nFrance and Italy. However, it is unclear as to whether the extra two clusters\nshould be considered as distinctive regime types or merely as subgroups of the\ncash versus services 211\nLiberal and Conservative \u2018worlds of welfare\u2019, perhaps reflecting different political\nattitudes to the roles of cash benefits or welfare services. Further research into the\nfive clusters, perhaps incorporating other services such as social care or education,\nis needed before firmer conclusions can be drawn.\nWelfare states cannot be accurately analysed and classified by cash benefit\nprogrammes alone. Welfare state modelling, and the construction of typologies,\nneeds to encapsulate the full diversity of a welfare state, or welfare state regime, by\nexamining as many aspects of provision and service delivery as possible. Services\nare a vital element of welfare state provision and they need to be more adequately\nreflected in comparative research. It will be more fruitful if future attempts at\nwelfare state modelling combined both cash and services (Daly and Lewis, 2000).\nReferences\nAbrahamson, P.
