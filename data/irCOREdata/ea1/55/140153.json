Advances in micro and nanofluidics have influenced technological developments in\nseveral areas, including materials, chemistry, electronics and bio-medicine. The phenomena\nobserved at micro and nanoscale are characterised by their inherent multiscale nature. Accurate\nnumerical modelling of these phenomena is the cornerstone for enhancing the applicability\nof micro and nanofluidics in the industrial environment. We investigated different strategies for\napplying macroscopic boundary conditions to microscopic simulations. Continuous rescaling of\natomic velocities and velocity distribution functions, such as Maxwell-Boltzmann or Chapman-\nEnskog, were investigated. Simulations were performed for problems involving liquids and\ngases under different velocity and temperature conditions. The results revealed that the selection\nof the most suitable method is not a trivial issue and depends on the nature of the problem,\navailability of computational resource and accuracy requirement.\nKeywords: multiscale modelling, heat transfer, molecular dynamics, hybrid atomistic contin-\nuum methods, micro\/nanofluid dynamics\n1 INTRODUCTION\nDuring the last decade, nanofluidics has emerged as a strongly emerging field [1] and has al-\nready found applications in various disciplines including bioengineering, medicine and chem-\nistry [2]. In the near future, it is also expected to have impact in many areas, such as drug\ndelivery and nano-manufacturing.\nNanoscale devices have unique characteristics and present significant differences compared\nto larger scale ones. Surface properties for this type of devices are dominant and, therefore,\nunderstanding of the phenomena involved, as well as efficient and realistic modelling of these\nphenomena is of paramount importance [3]. Traditional continuum flow models, based on\nNavier-Stokes equations with no-slip boundary conditions are not applicable for microscale sys-\ntems, such as combustors, valves, nozzles and turbomachines [3], due to the break down of the\ncontinuum approximation. In particular, the macroscopic constitutive relations and boundary\nconditions become inadequate [4]. This discrepancy increases further for nanofluidic devices,\nwhere molecular modelling must be employed. Molecular simulations are computationally\nintensive, thereby restricting their application to nanoscale systems and time scales below mi-\ncroseconds. Thus, modelling nanofluidic devices presents a significant challenge due to the\ninaccuracy of the continuum models and inefficiency of the molecular ones in the meso scale\nregimes. To address this challenge, multiscale methods that bridge the gap between micro-\nscopic and macroscopic description have been proposed [5]. One group of multiscale methods\nfor nano- and microscale systems couple molecular and continuum solvers to provide a unified\ndescription from nanoscale to larger scales and are called hybrid methods.\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (9 November 2009)\n\u00a9  2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers [DOI: 10.1117\/1.3269638]\nReceived 23 Jul 2009; accepted 4 Nov 2009; published 9 Nov 2009 [CCC: 19342608\/2009\/$25.00]\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 1\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\nA number of hybrid methods for fluidics have been proposed in the literature [5\u201315].The\nmajority of these methods are based on the domain decomposition technique which is suit-\nable for problems where the continuum equations are valid in most parts of the computational\ndomain, but fail to fully describe the phenomena in a particular area. The main idea is to decom-\npose the simulation domain into two distinct regions. One region is modelled as a continuum\nand solved by a continuum fluid dynamics (CFD) solver, while the other region is modelled\nusing molecular dynamics (MD) [5, 6]. Within each region the solution is separately computed\nand both regions are linked by a hybrid solution interface (HSI). The advantage is that the\ncomputationally expensive MD solver is only applied within a small region, whereas the major-\nity of the simulation domain is solved by a CFD solver, which is several orders of magnitude\nfaster [6, 16]. The domain decomposition technique does not decouple the time scales between\nthe macroscopic and microscopic scales. Thus, the maximum computational time is restricted\nto time scales computed by MD. In order to handle the time scale constraints a pointwise cou-\npling (PWC) method has been recently proposed [13, 17]. In the PWC, the entire domain is\ncomputed by the macroscopic solver while the microscale model enters as a refinement and is\nused locally for obtaining macroscopic properties from the microscopic model. One important\nproperty of the PWC is that it naturally decouples the microscopic and macroscopic timescales.\nThe accuracy and efficiency of multiscale approaches depend to a great extent on the bound-\nary condition transfer (BCT) method that constrains the atomistic region to the continuum con-\nditions. The problem of imposing macroscopic conditions on a molecular system is a very\nchallenging task and has not yet been addressed for a general case [16,18]. The main difficulty\nis the disparity between degrees of freedom modelled by the atomistic and continuum models.\nThis paper investigates mesoscale methods for applying macroscopic boundary conditions\nto a microscopic system, in particular temperature enforcement. However, the anticipated im-\npact of this work is broader as these techniques can be implemented to other multiscale prob-\nlems. In the simulation problems presented in this paper, MD is used within the PWC for ob-\ntaining macroscopic properties either near the boundary of the continuum domain or at specific\npoints inside the flow domain. The paper is organised as follows. Sec. 2 provides a brief de-\nscription of MD, the PWC coupling scheme and the methods for enforcing the continuum states\nin the MD domain. The results for liquid flow cases are presented in Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 3.2. In\nSec. 3.3 the results of gaseous flow simulations are discussed. The conclusions are summarised\nin Sec. 4.\n2 METHODOLOGY\n2.1 Molecular Dynamics\nIn the PWC method, MD simulations are used to calculate macroscopic properties of the fluid.\nThe nature of MD method is deterministic so that if velocities, positions and equations of mo-\ntions of the components of a molecular system are known at time t, the state of the systems is\nfully determined at time t+\u2206t. Atoms are modelled as mass points with position ri and mass\nmi. Their motion is governed by Newton\u2019s equation of motion, written for each atom i in the\nfollowing form\nmir\u00a8i = \u2212\u2202Vi\n\u2202ri\n. (1)\nThe potential energy Vi is the sum of semi-empirical analytical functions that represent the\ninteratomic forces. The atomic trajectories are calculated by integrating Eq. (1) in time for\nall atoms. Despite the apparent simplicity, the simulations are computationally demanding\ndue to the large number of atoms involved. Nowadays, modern parallel computers allow MD\nsimulations of several millions of atoms [19]. The MD simulations in this study were performed\nusing a modified version of LAMMPS [20], which employs the velocity Verlet scheme [21] to\nintegrate Eq. (1).\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 2\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125.

Schematic representation of PWC.\nAll interatomic interactions are modelled by the shifted Lennard-Jones (LJ) 6-12 potential.\nBetween a pair of atoms i and j with the distance rij , the LJ potential is given by\nV LJij = 4\u0002\n[(\n\u03c3\nrij\n)12\n\u2212\n(\n\u03c3\nrij\n)6\n\u2212\n(\n\u03c3\nrc\n)12\n+\n(\n\u03c3\nrc\n)6]\n. (2)\nThe cut-off distance is set to rc = 2.5\u03c3.\nDepending on the choice of \u0002, \u03c3 and the massm, the LJ-potential can represent a number of\nelements whose atoms interact via Van-der-Waals forces. Unless otherwise stated, reduced units\nare used throughout the paper. For Argon these would represent \u0002 = \u0002Ar = 119.8K\/kB, \u03c3 =\n\u03c3Ar = 0.34 nm, m = mAr = 0.34 amu. The corresponding time unit is \u03c4 = (m\u03c32\/\u0002)1\/2 =\n2.16 ps.\n2.2 Pointwise coupling scheme\nIn the PWC scheme, the CFD solver advances the solution in the entire domain. MD simu-\nlations are used to (i) provide accurate boundary conditions, such as slip velocity, tangential\nstress or heat flux; (ii) substitute the constitutive relations, for example, to calculate pressure\n(P (\u03c1, T )); and (iii) calculate transport properties, such as viscosity for non-Newtonian fluids.\nIn the most simplistic PWC scheme the MD simulations are performed at every CFD time step,\ncorresponding to the local current continuum states. The macroscopic quantities of interest are\nmeasured from the MD simulations and fed back to the CFD solver, where they are used to\nadvance the solution. Obviously, this procedure leads to repetitive MD simulations of nearly\nidentical states and, thus, a more sophisticated algorithm that stores and makes use of already\nperformed MD simulations may be employed instead.\nIn order to perform MD simulations for the required continuum states, they must be con-\nstrained in an appropriate manner. Initially, this is achieved by setting up the molecular system\nwith the corresponding continuum density \u03c1con and temperature Tcon. During the actual MD\nsimulations, the molecular system is constrained to the continuum velocity gradient and tem-\nperature by controlling the molecular state within confined regions on the boundary of the MD\ndomains. Since this paper focuses on the implementation of continuum conditions to MD sim-\nulations for PWC, the test cases are one-dimensional continuum simulations which use three\ndimensional molecular simulations for computing boundary conditions and viscosity. For this\nsetup, the PWC scheme must distinguish between boundary cells and general cells away from\nthe boundary. Both cases are shown schematically in Fig. 1. In the general case, the MD sim-\nulations are constrained by two sides (upper and lower). On both sides, the continuum state is\nimposed within a small region. The two other dimensions are periodic. When the lower side is\nbounded by a wall, this is modelled by MD.\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 3\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125. Terms of Use:  http:\/\/spiedl.org\/terms\nEnforcing the continuum constraints requires to alter the properties of the atoms inside the\nconstrained region to match the continuum velocity, ucon, and temperature, Tcon. Addition-\nally, the local continuum pressure, Pcon, must be applied normal on the outer surface of the\nconstrained region in order to keep the atoms within the molecular domain and to subject the\nmolecular system to the correct pressure.\nThe velocity and temperature conditions can be imposed by two alternative methods. The\nfirst one is based on periodic rescaling of the atomic velocities [4, 10, 22\u201326], and the second\none on a periodic re-sampling from a velocity distribution functions, such as the Maxwell-\nBoltzmann [15, 27, 28] or the Chapman-Enskog [29\u201334] distribution.\n2.3 Rescaling techniques\nThe average velocity of particles in the constrained region Rctr must correspond to the contin-\nuum velocity ucon:\n1\nMctr\n\u2211\ni\u2208Rctr\nmiui = ucon , (3)\nwhere Mctr =\n\u2211\nmi, i \u2208 Rctr is the total mass of particles inside the constrained region. In\norder to satisfy Eq. (3) velocities, ui of the atoms inside the constrained region are periodically\nreplaced by u\n\u2032\ni, which is calculated by\nu\n\u2032\ni = ui \u2212\n1\nMctr\n\u2211\ni\u2208Rctr\nmiui + ucon . (4)\nHybrid methods usually apply the normal pressure through external forces [9, 22]. The\ndisadvantage of using an external force is that inserts\/removes energy depending on the velocity\nof the atoms onto which the force is applied to. This results in oscillations in the molecular\nsystem [6, 16]. The oscillations can be significantly reduced by using the velocity reversing\nscheme [6]. According to this, the pressure, Pcon, is applied by reversing the velocity vector\nof atoms that move in the opposite direction of the pressure force. If the outer surface of\nthe constrained region is normal to a dimension \u03b1, then an atom i is reversed by changing\nthe sign of the respective velocity component: v\n\u2032\ni,\u03b1 = \u2212v\n\u2032\ni,\u03b1. For each reversed atom, i, a\nmomentum pi = 2miv\n\u2032\ni,\u03b1 is applied. To apply a pressure of Pcon at each MD time step,\nthe algorithm continues to reverse atoms until the transferred momentum equals the required\nmomentum transfer due to the pressure:\u2211\ni\n2miv\n\u2032\ni = Pcon\u2206tActr , (5)\nwhere the sum is over the reversed atoms, \u2206t is the size of the time step and Actr is the surface\narea of the constrained region. The main advantages of the velocity reversing scheme are its\nsimplicity, robustness, and the absence of any artifacts due to transfer of energy [6].\nThe continuum temperature is applied to the microscopic system through an energy transfer\nscheme [6]. The main idea is to add or remove energy from the microscopic system in order\nto match the macroscopic temperature without modifying the particles\u2019 mean velocity. The\nenergy transfer is performed independently for each dimension and is achieved through scaling\nthe velocity vectors of the atoms as follows:\nu\n\u2032\ni = uif + c. (6)\nThe scaling factor, f , is calculated by\nf =\n(\n1 +\n3NctrkBTcon\n2Ek,int\n)\n, (7)\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 4\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125.

The factor c is given by\nc = u\u00af(1\u2212 f) (9)\nand ensures that no momentum is transferred along with the energy.\n2.4 Resampling techniques\nThe second BCT method utilises velocity distribution functions. For the scope of this study\nthe atomistic velocities are periodically sampled either using the Maxwell-Boltzmann or the\nChapman-Enskog distribution. Resampling has been previously applied by other authors in\nrelation to the moving contact line problem [15,27].\nTheMaxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution is the natural velocity distribution of an atomic\nor molecular system in an equilibrium state [35]. It defines the probability of the one-dimensional\nvelocity components of an atom assuming a specific value, based on a temperature T and the\natom mass m.\nFor the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution the probability density f(C) of the thermal veloc-\nity C = u\/ (2kBT\/m)\n1\/2 is given by\nf(C) =\n1\n\u03c03\/2\nexp (\u2212C) . (10)\nEach particle in the upper region is assigned a velocity u = ucontinuum+umaxwell, where\numaxwell is the velocity of the Maxwellian distribution and ucontinuum is the macroscopic\nvelocity. The assigned atomistic velocities in the constrained region are then defined as\nuia = u\ncon\na +\n\u221a\nkBT con\nmi\n\u00b7 \u03c8, (11)\nwhere \u03c8 denotes a Gaussian distributed number N (0, 1) and ucona is the ath component of the\ncontinuum velocity.\nIn order to ensure that every particle remains inside the molecular domain a reflective plane\nis placed at the upper boundary of the constrained region. This is simpler than the velocity\nreversing scheme, but can only be applied to incompressible flows because the normal pressure\nis a result of the reflected atoms.\nFor non-equilibrium situations the Chapman-Enskog distribution is a better model and,\ntherefore, its application for sampling the atomic velocities has also been investigated. It has\nbeen used primarily in hybrid simulations of dilute gases that employ geometrical decomposi-\ntion and state coupling [30\u201334].\nThe Chapman-Enskog distribution is a perturbed Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution [29] with\nprobability density given by\nf (C) = \u0393 (C)\u03c0\u22123\/2exp\n(\u2212C2) , (12)\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 5\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125.

The atomistic velocities for the current distribution are sampled from Eq. (12) through\nthe implementation of an acceptance-rejection random velocity generator described in Ref. 29.\n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1 Liquid flow for the boundary problem\nIn this section the results of BCT schemes for liquid and gas flow and heat transfer problems\nare presented. The size of the molecular domain was 20\u03c3, 50\u03c3 and 20\u03c3 in x, y and z directions,\nrespectively. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the x and z directions. Three regions\nwere assigned: the wall at the bottom, the BCT region at top of the domain and the flow region\nin between.\nThe wall was modelled by two planes of a face-centred cubic (fcc) lattice, where the wall\nmolecules were allowed to vibrate around their lattice sites by a harmonic spring with stiffness\nk = 50\u0002\/\u03c32. Their velocities were rescaled to the wall temperature Twall = 1.0\u0002\/kB . The\ndensity of the wall atoms was \u03c1wall = 1.0 m\u03c3\u22123 and their mass was equal to that of the fluid\natoms. Here, the wall properties do not correspond to any specific solid material, but represent\na solid wall with no slip boundary condition. Similar models for solid walls have been used\nin previous studies [27, 36, 37]. The BCT region was located at y > 45\u03c3 and the flow region\nat 1.5\u03c3 < y < 45\u03c3. The total number of atoms was 18, 820, of which 676 formed the wall\nand the remaining 18, 144 the fluid within the flow and BCT regions. The fluid density was\n\u03c1fluid = 0.8 m\u03c3\n\u22123 and the simulation time step was \u2206tMD = 0.001\u03c4 . Each simulation was\nrun for 2\u00d7 106 time steps and the calculated quantities were averaged over the last 2 \u00b7 105 time\nsteps.\nInitially, the rescaling technique and the one based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-\ntion have been tested for a stationary heat transfer problem with continuum conditions Tcon =\n1.5 \u0002\/kB and ucon,x = 0 \u03c3\/\u03c4 on the upper constrained region. The Chapman-Enskog distribu-\ntion was utilised when the results obtained from the Maxwell-Boltzmann were not physically\ncorrect. A typical example is the application of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the\ndilute gases.\nIn the second test case the boundary conditions were Tcon = 1.0 \u0002\/kB and ucon,x =\n1.0 \u03c3\/\u03c4 . The temperature of the constrained region was equal to the wall temperature and,\nthus, the temperature was expected to remain nearly constant throughout the molecular domain.\nThe results from both BCT methods are in good agreement with the theory as shown in Fig.\n3. A linear velocity profile was obtained and the temperature remained constant and equal to\n1.0 \u0002\/kB .\nIt was found that for the rescaling technique the size of the BCT region can influence the\nconsistency of velocity values with the macroscopic conditions. In Eq. 1 the atomistic velocities\nare rescaled to a new mean velocity equal to the continuum constraint. In the current test case\nthis results in an underestimated velocity in the lower boundary of the rescaled region (Fig. 4).\nThe inconsistency between the macroscopic and microscopic states introduces inaccuracies in\nthe simulation procedure. To address this issue, in the current test cases the BCT region has\nbeen further divided to four bins, with height 2.5\u03c3 each.\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 6\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125.

The size of the molecular\ndomain was 10\u03c3, 30\u03c3 and 10\u03c3 in the x, y and z dimensions, respectively. The molecular domain\nwas subdivided into three regions: the upper and lower BCT regions and the flow region in\nbetween. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the x and z dimensions. The lower\nconstrained region was located at y < 5\u03c3, the flow region at 5 < y < 25 with height H = 20\u03c3\nand the upper constrained region at y > 25\u03c3.

The\nperformed simulations were restricted to boundary node problems only. The size of the molec-\nular domain was 200\u03c3, 120\u03c3 and 200\u03c3 in the x, y and z directions, respectively, and similar\nto the liquid flows the domain was divided into two subregions; the flow region was located at\ny < 100\u03c3 and the BCT region at 100\u03c3 < y < 120\u03c3. At the bottom of the molecular domain\na stochastic thermal wall was imposed. A stochastic thermal wall is similar to a reflective wall\nbut corrects or resamples the velocity vector of the reflected atom depending on the transferred\nthermal energy to or from the wall.

Equation (17) means that low density results in higher Knudsen numbers and,\nconsequently, higher magnitudes of the slip velocity. Figure 9(a) shows the velocity profiles\nobtained from the gas flow using the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution based BCT scheme for\nthe three densities. As expected, higher slip velocities near the wall are obtained for lower den-\nsity values. However, large deviations are observed between the applied velocity constraints\nand the actual velocity in the upper boundary of the flow region. This is because of an ad-\nditional slip velocity generated between the flow and BCT regions due to the application of\nthe Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Note that lower gas density results in higher deviation\nbetween the actual and applied velocity [15, 33]. To circumvent the unphysical slip at the con-\nstrained region, the same simulations have been performed with Maxwell-Boltzmann distribu-\ntion replaced by the Chapman-Enskog distribution. Figure 9(b) shows velocity profiles obtained\nwith the Chapman-Enskog distribution. Application of this distribution eliminates artificial slip\nphenomena between the flow and BCT regions.\nFor the last test case, the rescaling based technique and the method based on resampling\nthe Chapman-Enkog\u2019s distribution are utilised for gas flow simulations in the same domain\nwith the previous gas simulations, with density \u03c1 = 0.05 m\u03c3\u22123, and continuum constraints\nucon,x = 1.0 \u03c3\/\u03c4 and Tcon = 1.0 \u0002\/kB and wall temperature Twall = 1.0 \u0002\/kB .

Two BCT methods of constraining the molecular domain to the\ncontinuum state have been examined, one based on rescaling the atoms\u2019 velocities and the other\none is based on velocity sampling through a distribution function.\nThe rescaling BCTmethod was implemented in conjunction with a velocity reversing scheme\nwith regards to the macroscopic pressure. Applying the correct value of pressure and minimis-\ning any associated artifacts is crucial for the performance of any hybrid scheme. Inconsistencies\nin the pressure can shrink the simulation domain or even make particles drift away. This can\ngenerate errors and instabilities in the hybrid procedure. Simulations performed with the rescal-\ning BCT method show that it can be successfully applied to both liquid and gas flows. The size\nof the regions where the velocity constraints are applied has to be selected carefully in order to\nobtain consistent velocities with the continuum state.\nFor the second BCT method, Maxwell-Boltzmann and Chapman-Enskog distribution func-\ntions were examined. The former has been used in liquid simulations and the results were found\nin good agreement with the rescaling BCT method. The size of the constrained domain, the way\nthat the domain is terminated and the sampling frequency may have significant impact on the\nresults when the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is used. Inadequate sampling frequency can\nlead to unrealistic effects, such as trapping of particles in the constrained region, or deviations\nbetween the macroscopic and microscopic velocities. Selection criteria of these parameters\ndepends on the problem in question and cannot be defined explicitly. The application of the\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution to gas flows leads to discrepancies between the desired and the\nactual applied velocity. This discrepancy can be corrected by applying the Chapman-Enskog\ndistribution. The results obtained are then consistent with the rescaling-based BCT method and\nlarger MD simulations.\nThe selection of BCT method is not a trivial issue. It depends on the specific simulated\nproblem and a number of other parameters such as the accuracy requirements and the available\ncomputational resource. The main advantage of the rescaling method is its generic nature and\nbroad range of applicability. However, it is less computationally efficient compared to the\nvelocity distribution function method.\nJournal of Nanophotonics, Vol. 3, 031960 (2009)                                                                                                                                    Page 12\nDownloaded from SPIE Digital Library on 23 May 2011 to 138.250.27.125.
