INTRODUCTION\nThe primordial curvature perturbation \u0001 provides one of\nthe few windows available to the early Universe, and is the\nsubject of intense interest at present. It may be that \u0001 is\npractically Gaussian. Then its Fourier components will\nhave practically no correlation, except for the one required\nby the reality condition. The latter is defined by the two-\npoint correlator, specified by the spectrumP \u0001 \u00f0k\u00dewhere k is\nthe wave number. On cosmological scales, the observed\nCMB anisotropy gives an almost scale-independent value\nP \u0001 \u2019 \u00f05\u0001 10\u00025\u00de2.\nAccording to typical scenarios for the generation of \u0001 ,\nthe principle signal for non-Gaussianity would be the\nthree-point correlator, specified by the nonlinearity pa-\nrameter fNL. At present there is only an upper bound\njfNLj & 100. Over the next few years, the bound will go\ndown to jfNLj & 5 or so if there is no detection.\nDuring inflation, the vacuum fluctuation of each canoni-\ncally normalized light scalar field becomes a classical\nperturbation, with a nearly scale-independent and\nGaussian spectrum. It is usually supposed that one or\nmore of these perturbations is responsible for the primor-\ndial curvature perturbation \u0001 . In this case, \u0001 is statistically\nhomogeneous and isotropic, which means that its correla-\ntors are invariable under translations and rotations. Then\nP \u0001 \u00f0k\u00de depends only on the magnitude of a momentum\n(wave vector) k, and fNL\u00f0k1; k2; k3\u00de depends on the lengths\nof the sides of a triangle.\nMost of the proposals for generating \u0001 from the scalar\nfield perturbations belong to one of two broad classes,\nwhich are distinguished by their prediction for fNL. If \u0001\nis generated during single-field inflation one generally has\njfNLj & 10\u00022. More strongly, this bound applies to all\nsingle-field models in the squeezed configuration k1 \u2019\nk2 \u0003 k3. If instead \u0001 is generated at or after the end of\ninflation, fNL becomes almost scale independent. In this\ncase the prediction for jfNLj is usually at least of order 1\nand can be as big or bigger than the observational bound.\nUnder the assumption of statistical isotropy, the con-\nstraints on fNL from current observation at the two-\u0002 level\nare [1]\n\u0002 9< flocalNL < 111; \u0002151< fequilNL < 253; (1)\nwhere the label \u2018\u2018local\u2019\u2019 can be taken to mean the squeezed\nconfiguration k1 \u2019 k2 \u0004 k3 and the label \u2018\u2018equil\u2019\u2019 can be\ntaken to mean the equilateral configuration k1 \u00bc k2 \u00bc k3.\nThe first result might be regarded as weak evidence for a\nflocalNL \u0003 1, which if confirmed would rule out the genera-\ntion of \u0001 during single-field inflation.\nRecently, it has been suggested that the perturbation of\nsome vector field may generate part or even all of the\ncurvature perturbation. Such a thing is possible because\nthe vacuum fluctuation of a vector field can generate an\nalmost scale-independent and Gaussian spectrum although\nthe condition for that to happen is rather special (e.g. it\ndoes not happen for a canonically normalized light vector\nfield.) The contribution to \u0001 from a vector field perturba-\ntion is statistically homogeneous but not in general statis-\ntically isotropic. Then the spectrum may depend on the\ndirection of k, and the bispectrum may depend on the\norientation of the triangle of vectors \u00f0k1; k2; k3\u00de.\nObservational bounds on statistical anisotropy have not\nreceived much attention, and are not mentioned in the\notherwise comprehensive analysis by the WMAP team\n[1]. As far as we know, the only available result [2] con-\ncerns the spectrum. It is parametrized in the form\nP \u0001 \u00f0k\u00de \u00bc \u00bd1\u00fe g\u00f0d^ \u0005 k^\u00de2\u0006P iso\u0001 \u00f0k\u00de; (2)\nwhere k \u00bc jkj and the hats denote unit vectors. After\ntaking account of all possible uncertainties, the conclusion\nfrom this study is g & 0:31 or so. We will adopt a bound\ng & 0:1 for definiteness.\nUsing the \u0003N formalism [3\u20136], one can write general\nformulas for the contribution of a vector field perturbation\nto the spectrum and the bispectrum. They were evaluated in\nRef. [7] for the case that \u0001 is generated at the end of\ninflation, and in Ref. [8] for the case that \u0001 is generated\nby the curvaton mechanism. (Vector field inflation was also\nconsidered in Ref. [8] but we shall not consider it here.) It\nwas found that the contribution to P \u0001 spectrum is of the\n*m.karciauskas@lancaster.ac.uk\n\u2020k.dimopoulos1@lancaster.ac.uk\n\u2021d.lyth@lancaster.ac.uk\nPHYSICAL REVIEW D 80, 023509 (2009)\n1550-7998=2009=80(2)=023509(8) 023509-1 \u0001 2009 The American Physical Society\nform shown in Eq. (2). An analogous form for the contri-\nbution to fNL is to be obtained in this work. These are the\ntree-level contributions. The one-loop contribution toP \u0001 is\ngiven in Ref. [8] but the one-loop contribution to fNL is not\nknown at the time of writing.\nFrom the formula for P \u0001 , one sees that its statistical\nanisotropy could easily be as big or bigger than the obser-\nvational bound. The purpose of this paper is to consider\nalso fNL. We want to know if a vector field contribution to\nfNL could be big enough to observe, bearing in mind that\nits contribution to P \u0001 should respect the observational\nbound. We answer this question in the affirmative, and\ngive explicit formulas for the dependence of fNL on the\norientation of the triangle.\nII. fNL INCLUDING VECTOR PERTURBATIONS\nThe evolution of the curvature perturbation \u0001 on super-\nhorizon scales is most readily described using a separate\nuniverse approach [3\u20136]. In a recent paper [8] the formal-\nism was extended to take into account the possible statis-\ntical anisotropy in \u0001 , where it was shown that once one\nincludes perturbations of the vector field, the resulting\ncurvature perturbation can be calculated up to quadratic\nterms using the following equation:\n\u0001\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc N\u0004\u0003\u0004\u00fe NAi \u0003Ai \u00fe 12N\u0004\u0004\u00f0\u0003\u0004\u00de2 \u00fe 12NA\u0004i\u0003\u0004\u0003Ai\n\u00fe 12NAij\u0003Ai\u0003Aj; (3)\nwhere N is the number of e-folds of expansion of the\nunperturbed universe, the lower case roman letters denote\nspatial indices, and Einstein summation over those indices\nis assumed. The derivatives of N with respect to the fields\nare denoted as\nN\u0004 \u0007 @N@\u0004 ; N\nA\ni \u0007\n@N\n@Ai\n; N\u0004\u0004 \u0007 @\n2N\n@\u00042\n;\nNA\u0004i \u0007\n@2N\n@\u0004@Ai\n; and NAij \u0007\n@2N\n@Ai@Aj\n:\n(4)\nTo obtain Eq. (3) it was assumed that the anisotropy of the\nexpansion of the Universe is negligible. Even for the vector\nfields having a considerable contribution to the curvature\nperturbation the isotropic expansion of the Universe can be\nachieved at least in several ways, for example, with the\noscillating massive vector field [9\u201311], using a triad of\northogonal vectors [12], a large number of identical ran-\ndomly oriented vector fields [13], or if the contribution of\nthe vector field(s) to the total energy density is negligible\n[7]. However, in general perturbations generated by vector\nfields will induce statistical anisotropy in \u0001 . In Eq. (3) we\nassume only a single scalar field\u0004 and a single vector field\nA\u0005.\nWe define the power spectrum and the bispectrum\nthrough the Fourier modes of \u0001 as\nh\u0001\u00f0k1\u00de; \u0001\u00f0k2\u00dei \u0007 \u00f02\u0006\u00de3\u0003\u00f03\u00de\u00f0k1 \u00fe k2\u00de 2\u0006\n2\nk3\nP \u0001 \u00f0k1\u00de; (5)\nh\u0001\u00f0k1\u00de\u0001\u00f0k2\u00de\u0001\u00f0k3\u00dei \u0007 \u00f02\u0006\u00de3\u0003\u00f03\u00de\u00f0k1 \u00fe k2\n\u00fe k3\u00deB\u0001 \u00f0k1;k2;k3\u00de; (6)\nwhere normalization of Fourier components is chosen to be\nsuch that\n\u0001\u00f0k\u00de \u0007\nZ\n\u0001\u00f0x\u00dee\u0002ik\u0005xdx: (7)\nNote that the power spectrum and the bispectrum are\ndependent on the direction of k.

By Ai we refer to the spatial components of\nthe physical vector field Ai \u00bc Bi=a, where a is the scale\nfactor in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) uni-\nverse. The field Bi, which enters the Lagrangian, is the\ncomoving vector field with the expansion of the universe\nfactored out. In FRW spacetime the temporal components\nof the physical and comoving fields are the same, A0 \u00bc B0\n[9,10].\nIII. ANISOTROPY IN THE VECTOR CURVATON\nMODEL\nIn this section we study the non-Gaussianity in the\ncurvature perturbation for a model of slow roll inflation\nwith an additional U\u00f01\u00de vector field which decays some\ntime after reheating and contributes to the total curvature\nperturbation following the curvaton mechanism [15]. For\nthis contribution to be non-negligible, the vector field must\nundergo particle production during inflation and obtain a\nsuperhorizon spectrum of perturbations. But the massless\nU\u00f01\u00de field is conformally invariant and, consequently, its\nquantum fluctuations are not amplified during inflation.\nThis means that in order for such a vector field to undergo\nparticle production we have to brake its conformality [16].\nAnother problem is that a dominant homogeneous (homo-\ngenized by inflation) vector field could make the expansion\nof the Universe strongly anisotropic, which is in contra-\ndiction with observations.\nOne way out of this problem can be the curvaton mecha-\nnism [15,17,18]. The usual curvaton scenario incorporates\ntwo scalar fields: one that drives inflation and another one,\ncalled curvaton, which produces the curvature perturba-\ntion. During inflation the curvaton is subdominant.\nHowever, after reheating the universe is radiation domi-\nnated and its energy density is diluted as \u0007r \/ a\u00024. If the\nenergy density of the curvaton field decreases slower than\na\u00024, at some moment it can dominate (or nearly dominate)\nthe Universe and impose its own curvature perturbation.\nThis is the basic idea of the curvaton mechanism.\nHere we consider a massive vector field acting as the\ncurvaton. Before dominating the vector curvaton field is\nrapidly oscillating in a quasiharmonic manner. As shown in\nRef. [9], the oscillating vector field behaves as a pressure-\nless isotropic fluid and can dominate without generating a\nlarge-scale anisotropy.\nANISOTROPIC NON-GAUSSIANITY FROM VECTOR FIELD . . .

[8] it was shown that for the oscillating\nvector field NAi and N\nA\nij are equal to\nNAi \u00bc\n2\n3\nr\nAi\nA2\n; (21)\nNAij \u00bc\n2\n3\nr\n\u0003ij\nA2\n; (22)\nwhere A \u0007 jAj is evaluated just before the vector field\ndecays and the parameter r is defined as\nr \u0007 3\u0007A\n3\u0007A \u00fe 4\u0007r \u00bc\n3\u0001A\n4\u0002\u0001A (23)\nwith \u0007A being the energy density of the vector field just\nbefore its decay (taken to be sudden),\u0001A \u0007 \u0007A=\u0007 and \u0007 \u00bc\n\u0007A \u00fe \u0007r.

The calculation of A? in the equi-\nlateral configuration is explained in more detail in the\nappendix.\nFor the squeezed configuration the bispectrum from the\nvector field perturbation in Eqs.

This\nmeans that fNL is anisotropic and that the amount of\nnon-Gaussianity is correlated with the statistical anisot-\nropy. However, from Eqs. (10), (11), and (13) it is clear\nthat, if particle production is isotropic (i.e. P 0 \u00bc P\u00fe and\nP\u0002 \u00bc 0) then p \u00bc q \u00bc 0 and the above expressions for\nfequilNL and f\nlocal\nNL become isotropic too and both reduce to\nfNL \u00bc 5=4r as in the scalar curvaton scenario, where we\nhave assumed that P\u0004 \u0004 P\u00fe, i.e. that the dominant con-\ntribution to the curvature perturbation is due to the vector\ncurvaton field only.\nB. fNL for nonminimally coupled vector curvaton\nIn Ref. [9] it was shown that a vector field can attain a\nscale invariant perturbation spectrum if its mass during\ninflation is equal to m2 \u00bc \u00022H2. One way to achieve a\nnegative mass squared of this magnitude is to introduce a\nnonminimal coupling of the vector field to gravity of the\nform 16RB\n\u0005B\u0005, where R is the Ricci scalar. The idea of\nsuch a nonminimally coupled vector curvaton was intro-\nduced in Ref. [11]. In that paper and in Ref. [8] it was\nshown that the power spectra for different polarizations are\nP \u00fe \u00bc\n\u0003\nH\n2\u0006\n\u0004\n2\n; P\u0002 \u00bc 0; and P 0 \u00bc 2\n\u0003\nH\n2\u0006\n\u0004\n2\n:\n(30)\nOne notices that the parity conserving transverse power\nspectrum and the power spectrum generated during the\nsingle scalar field inflation are equal, i.e. P\u00fe \u00bc P\u0004.\nThus the isotropic part of the curvature perturbation spec-\nKARC\u02c7IAUSKAS, DIMOPOULOS, AND LYTH PHYSICAL REVIEW D 80, 023509 (2009)\n023509-4\ntrum can be written as\nP iso\u0001 \u00bc P\u0004N2\u0004\u00f01\u00fe \b\u00de; (31)\nwhile the anisotropy parameter from Eq. (13) becomes\ng \u00bc \b\n1\u00fe \b : (32)\nUsing Eq. (30) we find\np \u00bc 1 and q \u00bc 0: (33)\nThus, the anisotropy in the vector field is rather strong,\nwhich means that it will have to remain subdominant, i.e.\n\u0001A \u0004 1. Using this and Eq. (27), the fequilNL for the non-\nminimally coupled vector curvaton is found to be\n6\n5\nfequilNL \u00bc 2\n\b2\n\u0001A\n\u0003\n1\u00fe 9\n8\nA2?\n\u0004\n: (34)\nSimilarly, flocalNL for the squeezed configuration in Eq. (29)\nis\n6\n5\nflocalNL \u00bc 2\n\b2\n\u0001A\n\u00f01\u00fe A2?\u00de: (35)\nSince P\u00fe \u00bc 12P 0 \u00bc P\u0004 \u00bc \u00f0H2\u0006\u00de2, for the typical values\nof the perturbations we have \u0003\u0004\n \u0003Ai \nH. This means\nthat, in order for the vector field contribution to be sub-\ndominant, we requireNA \u0004 N\u0004 (c.f. Eq. (3)). Hence, \b\u0004\n1 and g \u2019 \b. Thus, in view of Eqs. (34) and (35), we see\nthat fNL \n g2=\u0001A. Therefore, we find that the non-\nGaussianity is determined by the magnitude of the statis-\ntical anisotropy.\nThis prediction is valid in the regime j\u0003A=Aj \u0004 1which\ncorresponds to \u00012A * P \u0001\b, which implies fNL &\ng3=2=\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nP \u0001\nq\n. For smaller \u0001A, the contribution of the vector\nfield perturbation to \u0001 is of order \u0001A\u00bd\u0003A=\u00f0\u0003A2\u00de1=2\u0006. In\nother words, it is of order \u0001A and is the square of a\nGaussian quantity. The resulting prediction for its contri-\nbution to fNL would be given by a one-loop formula which\nhas not been evaluated at the time of writing.\nIV. ANISOTROPY GENERATED AT THE END OF\nINFLATION\nAs another example, we consider the generation of an\nanisotropic power spectrum at the end of inflation. The idea\nis based on Ref. [21] where it was shown that in hybrid\ninflation models the generation of curvature perturbations\ncan be realized due to inhomogeneous end of inflation.\nYokoyama and Soda [7] used this idea to generate the\nanisotropic contribution to the total curvature perturba-\ntions. In their model the anisotropy is generated at the\nend of inflation due to the vector field coupling with the\nwaterfall field. In this section we calculate the non-\nGaussianity of the model in Ref. [7] using our notation in\nSec. II.\nIn this model there are two components of the curvature\nperturbation: one generated during inflation and an aniso-\ntropic one, generated by a vector field at the end of in-\nflation:\n\u0001 \u00bc \u0001inf \u00fe \u0001end: (36)\nThe first component is due to the perturbation generated\nduring inflation. The second component is due to the\nperturbation of the vector field. Reference [7] considers a\nmassless, U\u00f01\u00de vector field. Without parity violating terms\nthe power spectra for left-handed and right-handed polar-\nizations are equal, while the longitudinal polarization is\nabsent for a massless field. In this situation we find that\nparameters p\u00f0k\u00de and q\u00f0k\u00de from Eq. (11) become\np \u00bc \u00021 and q \u00bc 0: (37)\nThe conformal invariance of the U\u00f01\u00de vector field is\nbroken through a noncanonical kinetic function of the\nform f2\u00f0t\u00deF\u0005\tF\u0005\t, where F\u0005\t \u00bc @\u0005B\t \u0002 @\tB\u0005 is the\nfield strength tensor and B\u0005\u2014comoving vector field.\nThis form of conformal invariance braking was considered\nin many papers (e.g. Refs. [10,22\u201325]) where it was found\nthat a scale invariant perturbation spectrum is obtained if\nf \/ a:\nP \u00fe \u00bc\n\u0003\nH\n2\u0006f\n\u0004\n2 \u00bc P\u0004f\u00022: (38)\nSo the isotropic part in Eq.

Also the level of non-Gaussianity is propor-\ntional to the anisotropy parameter squared, fNL \/ g2, as in\nthe nonminimally coupled vector curvaton model.\nV. DISCUSSION\nIn this paper we have calculated the amount of the non-\nGaussianity generated by the anisotropic part of the curva-\nture perturbation. We have also considered two specific\nmodels to generate the anisotropic curvature perturbation\nfrom the vector fields and calculated the non-Gaussianity\nin detail for those models. The results were given for the\nequilateral and squeezed configurations in Eqs. (34) and\n(35) for the model of nonminimally coupled vector curva-\nton and in Eqs. (49) and (50) for the end-of-inflation\nscenario. We have shown that fNL generated by the vector\nfield is anisotropic and that it is correlated with the amount\nand direction of the statistical anisotropy.\nAlthough in some specific models it would be possible\nto generate the statistically isotropic curvature perturbation\nonly from the vector field, however, in general, perturba-\ntions generated by the vector field are anisotropic. From\nobservations the bound on statistically anisotropic contri-\nbution to the total power spectrum is constrained to be less\nthan about 10%. In this case one can estimate the maximal\nfNL caused by the statistically anisotropic curvature per-\nturbation on fairly general grounds.\nLet us assume that the non-Gaussianity is produced\nsolely due to the vector field perturbations. If this is so\nthen Eqs. (17) and (20) suggest fNL \nB\u0001=P 2\u0001 , where we\nconsider that the anisotropic contribution to the curvature\nperturbation is subdominant, i.e. P \u0001 \u2019 P iso\u0001 . According to\nEqs. (16) and (19) we have B\u0001 \nM2NAA, where M \u0007\njMj and NAA \u0007 jjNAijjj. Thus, we have fNL \n\nM2NAA=P 2\u0001 .\nNow,M depends on the mechanism which breaks the\nconformality of the vector field and is responsible for the\ngeneration of its superhorizon perturbation spectrum. If\nthis mechanism does not introduce additional mass scales,\nthen, on dimensional grounds, we expect the anisotropy in\nthe vector field perturbation to be of order unity, i.e. jpj,\njqj \nO\u00f01\u00de, barring cancellations such as due to parity\ninvariance (which results in q \u00bc 0) or an isotropic particle\nproduction, which gives p \u00bc q \u00bc 0 and generates no sta-\ntistical anisotropy. In our examples in Secs. III and IV we\nindeed analyzed such a situation, where the effective mass\nsquared of the vector field during inflation m2 \u00bc 16R \u00bc\n\u00022H2 or the time dependence of the kinetic function\n_f=f \u00bc H were both determined by the dynamics of the\nexpansion and given by H, the only scale in the theory. If\nthe anisotropy in the vector field perturbation is of order\nunity, then Eq. (9) gives M\n P ANA, where P A \u00bc\n2P\u00fe \u00fe P 0 is the power spectrum of the total vector field\nKARC\u02c7IAUSKAS, DIMOPOULOS, AND LYTH PHYSICAL REVIEW D 80, 023509 (2009)\n023509-6\nperturbation given by P A \u00bc k32\u00062\nP\nij\u0003Aij2 in the superhor-\nizon limit.

CONCLUSIONS\nIt is clear that the study of vector field contributions to\nthe primordial curvature perturbation is just beginning.\nGiven a scale invariant and Gaussian vector field perturba-\ntion, the calculation of \u0001 from the \u0003N formalism is\nstraightforward and should now be done for the full range\nof scenarios that have already been explored for the con-\ntribution of scalar field perturbations. Also, the Feynman\ngraph formalism available for the scalar field case should\nbe generalized to cover the vector field contributions. At a\ndeeper level, one also wishes to understand how the scale\ninvariant perturbation can be generated. One would also\nlike a fuller understanding of the generation of perturba-\ntions from the vacuum fluctuation when the expansion of\nthe unperturbed Universe is anisotropic, since that can\neasily happen in the presence of vector fields.\nFor the moment though, it is most urgent to confront\nspecific predictions for the form of the anisotropy with\nobservation. Specifically, we want to know what constraint\nis placed by observation on a contribution to fNL of the\nform in Eqs. (34) and (35) or Eqs. (49) and (50). It seems\nquite possible that with the latter prediction, valid for the\nsqueezed configuration, one might find a nonzero value at\nbetter than the 2-\u0002 level that is already found for the\nisotropic case. Such a finding, if confirmed, would be a\nsmoking gun for a vector field contribution to the curvature\nperturbation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported (in part) by the European\nUnion through the Marie Curie Research and Training\nNetwork \u2018\u2018UniverseNet\u2019\u2019 (MRTN-CT-2006-035863) and\nby STFC (PPARC) Grant No. PP\/D000394\/1.\nAPPENDIX: CALCULATION OF A?

This gives A1 \u00fe A2 \u00bc \u0002A3 and\nA21 \u00fe A22 \u00fe A23 \u00bc 2\u00f0A21 \u00fe A1A2 \u00fe A22\u00de;\nA1A2 \u00fe A2A3 \u00fe A3A1 \u00bc \u0002\u00f0A21 \u00fe A1A2 \u00fe A22\u00de;\nA21A\n2\n2 \u00fe A22A23 \u00fe A23A21 \u00bc \u00f0A21 \u00fe A1A2 \u00fe A22\u00de2: (A1)\nLet us define a vector A? which is the projection of A^ to\nthe plane containing vectors k^1, k^2, and k^3. Then the\nscalar product of these vectors and A^ is the same as the\nproduct with A?:\nA^ \u0005 k^a \u00bc A? \u0005 k^a; (A2)\nwhere a \u00bc 1, 2, 3.\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that the angle\nbetween A? and k^1 is \u2019\nA1 \u0007 A^ \u0005 k^1 \u00bc A? \u0005 k^1 \u00bc A? cos\u2019; (A3)\nwhere A? \u00bc jA?j. In equilateral configuration the angle\nbetween vectors k^1 and k^2 is 2\u0006=3, and A2 becomes\nA2 \u0007 A? \u0005 k^2 \u00bc A? cos\n\u0003\n\u2019\u00fe 2\u0006\n3\n\u0004\n\u00bc \u0002A?\n\u0003\n1\n2\ncos\u2019\u00fe\nffiffiffi\n3\np\n2\nsin\u2019\n\u0004\n: (A4)\nFrom the last two equations we get\nA21 \u00fe A1A2 \u00fe A22 \u00bc 34A2?: (A5)\nPutting this result back into Eq. (A1) we find\nA21 \u00fe A22 \u00fe A23 \u00bc 32A2?;\nA1A2 \u00fe A2A3 \u00fe A3A1 \u00bc \u000234A2?;\nA21A\n2\n2 \u00fe A22A23 \u00fe A23A21 \u00bc 916A4?: (A6)\nANISOTROPIC NON-GAUSSIANITY FROM VECTOR FIELD . . .
