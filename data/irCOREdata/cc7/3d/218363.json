Yet \nmost of it, particularly the newest, ignores internal governance condi-\ntions and implicitly assumes that once the structure of collective bar-\ngaining is coordinated or centralized, no other organizational factor \nneeds to be in place for wage moderation to materialize.1 recent po-\nlitical economic studies either disregard the internal decision-making \nprocess of trade unions2 or take at face value the conclusions of neocor-\nporatist studies from the 1980s.3\nWe argue that the internal governance processes within trade union \nconfederations are important for wage moderation but that the rela-\ntionship is very different from the one hypothesized by classic neo-\ncorporatist studies. Controlling for a number of factors, including the \ndegree of collective bargaining coordination, the organizational variable \nthat correlates with moderate wage growth is the degree to which trade \nunion confederations engage in a democratic organizational process \nthat directly involves workers in collective bargaining approval; it is not \nthe leaders\u2019 ability to impose their decisions upon lower-level structures \nand affiliates. furthermore, the evidence indicates that the coordina-\n*the authors wish to thank Joseph Doyle, thomas Kochan, Peter Hall, Bob Hanck\u00e9, rickard \nlocke, steve Pischke, Kenneth scheve, David soskice, and Peter swenson for helpful comments on \nprevious versions. marco simoni gratefully acknowledges financial support from the British acad-\nemy.\n1 layard, nickell, and Jackman 2005; Blanchard 2006.\n2 e.g., mares 2006.\n3 iversen 1999; traxler and Kittel 2001.\nWorld Politics 62, no. 4 (October 2010), 594\u2013635\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 trustees of Princeton University\ndoi: 10.1017\/s0043887110000201\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 595\n4 Przeworski and Wallerstein 1982; eichengreen 1996; eichengreen and iversen 1999.\ntion of collective bargaining and a process of democratic ratification are \ncomplements that magnify each other\u2019s wage-dampening effect.\nWe engage in an econometric analysis to document the existence \nof a relationship of robust dependence between wage moderation and \nworker involvement in contract approval, and then, through a historical \nreconstruction of developments in ireland and italy, illustrate the causal \nmechanisms that undergird this statistical association. these are the \ntwo countries in our sample in which both the involvement of work-\ners in decision making and the coordination of collective bargaining \nincreased the most, and thus provide an opportunity to investigate in \ngreater detail the uncovered complementarity between wage coordina-\ntion and rank-and-file involvement and its effect on wage moderation. \nthe case-study analysis suggests that the process of contract approval \ncontributes to wage moderation by strengthening the legitimacy of \ntop union leaders vis-\u00e0-vis both individual rank-and-file members and \ncontrarian organized factions. as such, leaders can resolve conflicting \nclaims inside their organizations at lower wage levels than would be \nachieved (all other things being equal) by a less participatory gover-\nnance process.\nthe article is divided into four parts. it begins with an analysis of the \ntheoretical links between the internal organization of collective actors \nand bargaining outcomes. next, it moves to an econometric analysis \nof the determinants of wage growth in sixteen Organization for eco-\nnomic Cooperation and Development (OeCd) countries between 1974 \nand 2000. then, through case studies of ireland and italy, it illustrates \nthe causal mechanisms by which worker involvement in contract rati-\nfication leads to more moderate union demands. finally, it concludes \nwith remarks on the relationship between wage moderation and em-\nployment growth.\nwAge MOdeRAtION ANd ORgANIzAtIONAL PROCeSSeS wIthIN  \ntRAde UNIONS\na key theme in the comparative political economy literature is the ex-\nploration of the institutional conditions that allow wages to grow closely \nin line with or even below productivity increases. Wage moderation is \ngenerally regarded as an important driver of a country\u2019s economic per-\nformance. some literature links it to rapid capital accumulation and \neconomic growth in Western europe after World War ii.4 more re-\n596 wORLd POLItICS \ncent literature argues that the ability of countries such as ireland or \nthe netherlands to achieve lower unemployment rates than other eu-\nropean countries in the 1990s and early 2000s is linked to their capac-\nity (associated with effective collective bargaining institutions) to keep \nwage growth in check.5\nPolitical economists seem to have reached a consensus, increasingly \nshared by macroeconomists, that coordinated or centralized bargaining \nleads to wage moderation and through that channel to lower unem-\nployment\u2014either directly or by moderating the impact of restrictive \nmonetary policies implemented by independent central banks.6 inter-\nestingly, this literature pays little to no attention to the organizational \ncharacteristics of the collective actors who participate in bargaining, \nand therefore implicitly assumes that centralized or coordinated bar-\ngaining needs no other condition to deliver wage restraint.\nto the extent that organizational factors are taken into account at \nall, the problem they pose is conceptualized as a horizontal problem \nof coordination among different unions. for example, where multiple \nunions try to coordinate on a single wage policy, an individual union is \ntempted to defect from the agreement especially if it is small enough to \nreap the benefits of its action (a higher wage) without paying the costs \nof defection (an increase in consumer prices).7 Hence bargaining coor-\ndination and the associated wage restraint should be more difficult to \nachieve where the representational structure is more fragmented and, \nconversely, easier where it is more concentrated.\nin addition to issues of horizontal collaboration or competition \namong unions, the vertical relationship between peak-level and decen-\ntralized structures and between leaders and members also seems rel-\nevant to the ability of trade unions to deliver wage moderation. this \ntheme is virtually ignored in the most recent literature but was dis-\ncussed extensively in the neocorporatist literature of the 1980s. that \nliterature concludes that the most propitious organizational context for \nwage moderation is one in which trade union confederations are highly \ncentralized, decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of \na limited number of peak leaders, and the influence of rank-and-file \nworkers is kept to a minimum.8\n5 Visser and Hemerijck 1997; Blanchard and Philippon 2004; Baccaro and simoni 2007.\n6 see, in a very long list, Cameron 1984; Calmfors and Driffill 1988; soskice 1990; scharpf 1991; \ngarrett 1998; Hall and franzese 1998; iversen 1999; soskice and iversen 2000; traxler and Kittel \n2001; franzese 2002; layard, nickell, and Jackman 2005; nickell, nunziata, and Ochel 2005; mares \n2006.\n7 golden 1993; iversen 1999; Carlin and soskice 2006.\n8 schmitter 1974.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 597\nthe literature accepts mancur Olson\u2019s argument9 that more broadly \nrepresentative (or encompassing) union organizations are more likely \nto voluntarily agree to wage restraint than small and sectoral ones. \nHowever, the literature does not stop there; it also specifies the in-\nternal conditions that protect large, encompassing organizations from \npotentially disruptive centrifugal tendencies. this further specification \nis necessary because in formally democratic countries trade unions are \nvoluntary associations. even when wage restraint is in the unions\u2019 orga-\nnizational interests, it is more than likely to conflict with the interests \nof at least some rank-and-file groups. these groups may conceivably \nreact to this discrepancy either by demanding a shift in union bargain-\ning policy from moderate to more aggressive, or by leaving the more \nresponsible, encompassing organization and joining\u2014or establishing \nex novo\u2014other, less encompassing associations better capable of satis-\nfying their specific interests.\nHalf-descriptively, half-prescriptively, the neocorporatist literature \nargues that to ensure internal compliance with centralized wage stipu-\nlations, decision-making power needs to be concentrated in the hands \nof a limited number of national leaders (assumed to be more long-\nterm oriented than their rank-and-file counterparts). in addition, these \nleaders need to be effectively insulated from the disruptive influence of \ntheir base. Based on these premises, the neocorporatist literature un-\nderscores the importance of monopolistic associations and compulsory \nor semicompulsory membership.10 readily apparent at least in some \nportion of the literature is also a less-than-enthusiastic stance in re-\ngard to trade union democracy; enabling the rank-and-file to influence \nunion choices through elections and worker referenda threatens to sub-\nvert centralized wage restraint.11\nthe literature\u2019s widely held view that achieving wage moderation re-\nquires union organizations with a capacity to impose leaders\u2019 decisions \non members12 has rarely been submitted to empirical testing. When it \nhas been, results have seemed contradictory. a small number of country \nstudies appear to corroborate it,13 but other studies\u2014including large-n \nones\u2014find no systematic link between the success of centralized wage \nregulation and a lack of internal democracy.14\n9 Olson 1965; 1982.\n10 schmitter 1974; Panitch 1979; Offe 1981.\n11 schmitter 1974; streeck 1988; 1994; Pemberton 1988; Przeworski 1991, 12; stepan-norris and \nzeitlin 1995.\n12 this view is found for example in garrett and Way 1999, 414\u201315; golden, Wallerstein, and \nlange 1999, 195; iversen 1999, 48; traxler and Kittel 2001, 65.\n13 streeck 1982; Wolfe 1985; Hardiman 1988.\n14 regini 1984; lange 1984; armingeon 1986; golden 1993.\n598 wORLd POLItICS \nWe contend that the neocorporatist argument is crucially dependent \non two dubious assumptions and a fallacious practical conclusion as-\nsociated with them. the assumptions are that the rank-and-files\u2019 policy \npreferences are determined outside of the organizational process and \nare systematically more extreme than the leaders\u2019. the fallacious con-\nclusion is that the only organizational mechanisms available to leaders \nto ensure worker compliance with centralized agreements are those of \nhierarchical authority and control, including, for example, the power to \nsign an agreement independently of workers\u2019 consensus, direct appoint-\nment of workers\u2019 representatives, centralized control over strike funds, \nand veto power over wage agreements signed by lower-level structures.\nassuming that preferences are exogenous and fixed, it must be noted \nthat if members are systematically more extreme than leaders, then di-\nrect rank-and-file control over organizational policy (through proce-\ndures like ratification of collective agreements or reelection of union \nrepresentatives) may indeed lead to militancy and\/or unwillingness to \ncompromise. this situation, however, is far from being the norm. for \nexample, in the U.K. in the thatcher\/major era, union governance re-\nforms that introduced compulsory balloting prior to strikes as a way of \nlimiting union militancy were motivated by exactly the opposite view, \nnamely that leaders have systematically more extreme preferences than \nmembers.15\nin addition, alessandro Pizzorno\u2019s classic account of workers\u2019 mili-\ntancy in italy16 suggests that one should not take for granted that \nunion policy will automatically reflect the preferences of the majority \nof workers. the unions\u2019 power is largely based on their ability to mo-\nbilize workers in strikes. Without democratic mechanisms for register-\ning worker preferences, leaders may take their cues from the revealed \npreferences of a biased subsample\u2014the workers who participate in or \npromote collective actions. in this way, in the absence of democratic \ndecision-making procedures, extreme preferences may prevail even \nwhen the majority is moderate. Within trade unions, this situation \nwould alter the internal balance of power in favor of vocal factions pur-\nsuing more militant agendas because workers who identify with these \nfactions are more likely to participate in strikes than workers with less \nintense preferences.17\nfurthermore, although it is customary in economic and political eco-\nnomic research to model trade union behavior as if workers\u2019 preferences \n15 see Undy and martin 1984, and Undy et al. 1996.\n16 Pizzorno 1978.\n17 sabel 1981.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 599\nwere given and fixed and leaders\u2019 choices as reflecting the exogenous \npreferences of the median worker,18 these assumptions seem empiri-\ncally untenable. a paper presented in 2010 based on microdata19 shows \nthat even when the issue at stake is highly salient and workers can \nbe expected to have made up their minds about it in advance, more \nthan 30 percent of workers are uncertain about the options being con-\nsidered before the ratification process is initiated. these workers form \ntheir preferences during the ratification process by heeding the advice \nof union leaders. in particular, they become favorable or unfavorable \ntoward the agreement at stake depending on the way it is presented to \nthem by leaders in assemblies. the resulting aggregate effects are large \nenough to transform an initially unfavorable majority into a favorable \none. in other words, a democratic ratification process does not just reg-\nister a positive majority but helps to shape it.\nthe claim about the endogeneity of worker preferences resonates \nwith the growing literature on the preference-shaping effects of de-\nmocracy.20 this literature is no longer just normative or theoretical. \nthere is by now ample empirical evidence that discourse and delibera-\ntion have net effects on preference formation and not solely aggrega-\ntive effects.21\nin light of the discussion above, neocorporatism\u2019s practical conclu-\nsion that hierarchical control is the only mechanism available for com-\npliance seems untenable.22 We hypothesize that democratic processes, \nsuch as assemblies and ratification of agreements, may lead to wage \nmoderation through two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive. \nfirst, if the majority of workers has moderate preferences, union de-\nmocracy may help this group emerge and prevail against a vocal minor-\nity whose mobilization capacities may be greater. second, to the extent \nthat union leaders manage to persuade their members that their true \ninterests are better served by moderate wage policies, the communi-\ncative processes associated with union democracy may contribute to \nconstructing the moderate majority in question.23\n18 farber 1978;

2) can veto \nwage agreements of affiliates; 3) can veto strikes; and 4) has its own \nstrike funds. in this way we obtained a 0\u20134 index of confederation hi-\nerarchy.32\nBecause no cross-country indicator was available to measure the \nextent of rank-and-file involvement in collective bargaining by union \nconfederations, we created our own. in doing so, we were faced with \ntwo problems. first, we found a dearth of secondary sources detailing \nthe internal procedures of trade unions\u2014a sign that, until recently, the \nconstruct was not thought to be particularly relevant for wage behavior. \nthus we relied primarily on interviews with trade union leaders. sec-\nond, we found union democracy to be a loaded and slippery concept. \nif one talks with trade unionists about it, one finds that virtually all \ntrade unions may be considered democratic (or non) according to some \ndefinition. those on the left of the union spectrum seem to consider \ndemocracy visible in its outcomes. When unions are not vocal and mil-\nitant it is interpreted as a sign that workers have been hoodwinked by \ntheir leaders and that therefore a democratic deficit is present.33 Oth-\ners argue that to the extent that the formal procedures and guarantees \nincluded in the constitutions of major trade union confederations\u2014\nnamely the fact that workers are allowed to affiliate freely; have free-\ndom of expression; elect their floor-shop representatives; and elect, \neither directly or indirectly, the delegates to higher-level structures in-\ncluding the confederation congress\u2014can be likened to those existing \nin many democratic polities, trade unions are at least as democratic as \nnational governments.34\nWe do not address here the normative issue about what constitutes \na genuine union democracy. Our indicator, contract ratification (CR), is \n31 Kenworthy 2003.\n32 Data from golden, lange, and Wallersten 2006 (henceforth referred to as the gLw database). \nWe updated the measure from 1993 to 2000 and coded ireland based on the same sources used to \nconstruct the measure of contract ratification (see below in this article).\n33 see Bertinotti 1991; minkin 1991, 159\u201365; Cremaschi 1993.\n34 Willey 1971.\n602 wORLd POLItICS \nless ambitious and seeks to capture the extent to which rank-and-file \nworkers are involved in the process of approving collective bargaining \noutcomes at the sectoral and\/or national levels. CR varies from 0 to 2. \nthe score is 2 when national collective agreements, in particular the \nmost politically divisive ones, are adopted through secret ballots among \nmembers (or, a fortiori, workers). an intermediate case (CR = 1) is re-\ncorded when union leaders only consult workers informally on collective \nagreements, asking either for a show of hands or for opinions in open \nassemblies. CR is null when the leadership never consults members over \ncollective agreements or, alternatively, when there are no sectoral or \nnational collective bargaining agreements in the country in question.35 \nthe latter rule creates a linkage between contract ratification and bar-\ngaining centralization. the correlation between the contract ratification \nindex and a measure of collective bargaining centralization is positive, \nbut far from perfect (\u03c1 = 0.41).36 additionally, it should be emphasized \nthat the measures of confederation hierarchy and contract ratification \nare orthogonal, not negatively correlated (\u03c1 = 0.07). this means that a \nunion confederation could involve the rank-and-file in contract rati-\nfication while simultaneously retaining authority to veto contract and \nstrike decisions, make appointments within affiliate organizations, and \nkeep its own strike funds.37\nall other things being equal, a union that involves the rank-and-file \nin contract approval should be considered more democratic than one \nthat does not. However, we cannot assess the normative quality of the \norganizational processes involved and therefore do not mean to imply \nthat a union confederation scoring higher on our index is necessarily \nmore democratic than another scoring lower. Organizational processes \nwithin trade union confederations are known to reflect national cultural \nspecificities.38 this might contribute to the explanation of why the no-\ntion of union democracy is controversial among union practitioners. \nlike other existing indicators of industrial relations institutions,39 the \nCR index focuses on objective formal characteristics rather than subjec-\ntive interpretations of substance.\nthe CR index was created for sixteen OeCd countries between 1974 \nand 2000. the country scores are based on two waves of interviews \n35 this second instance refers to, in our database, Canada and the U.s. the econometric results \npresented below are robust to alternative or simultaneous dropping of these countries.\n36 this is the variable BARgLev2 in the gLw database.\n37 an example is the norwegian LO, which scores 2 out of 2 on contract ratification and 3 out of 4 \non confederation hierarchy.\n38 Crouch 1992; Hyman 2001.\n39 Kenworthy 2003.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 603\nwith trade union leaders participating in the international labor Or-\nganization\u2019s (ILO) international labor Conference (in June 2004 and \n2007) and governing Body (in 2004) in geneva, switzerland.40 the \ninformation was cross-checked with national industrial relations ex-\nperts as well as with secondary sources, leading to the scores presented \nin table 1.41\nthe 0 \u20132 indicator reveals some interesting differences across coun-\ntries, including among those that are traditionally considered to have \nsimilar trade union structures. among the nordic countries, for exam-\nple, worker ratification is never practiced in sweden (CR = 0). the con-\nstitution of the swedish trade union confederation (LO) has stated since \n1941 that the power to decide over collective agreements and industrial \naction must be vested in the executive committee of the national union \nas a condition for membership in the confederation.42 the situation is \nthe same in the other two swedish confederations, the swedish con-\nfederation of professional employees (tCO) and the swedish confed-\neration of professional associations (SACO). in contrast, the constitu-\ntion of the norwegian confederation of trade unions (norwegian LO) \nexplicitly requires that workers vote on collective agreements through \nreferenda. if less than two-thirds of workers affected by the issue par-\nticipate in the ballot, the outcome of the referendum is advisory only. if \na collective agreement involves more than one union, the confederation \nmay decide to organize a joint ballot with the explicit permission of \nthe unions in question. similar rules apply to the two other norwegian \nconfederations, the yS (a confederation of vocational unions) and the \nAf (a confederation of norwegian professional associations).\nin Denmark, ballots are also regularly organized and workers voting \non collective bargaining agreements is tightly linked with the institu-\ntion of state mediation. When collective bargaining reaches an impasse, \nthe state mediator is entitled by law to propose the terms of a solution \nthat is then voted upon by the unions concerned. most unions, and \nparticularly the largest ones, organize secret ballots of their member-\nship prior to voting on a proposed solution. Participation rates in these \nballots are generally quite low and rejection of the terms is rare though \nit has happened.\nOther interesting differences emerge when comparing Belgium and \nthe netherlands. in Belgium, the act of 5 December 1968 presumes \n40 see also simoni 2007.\n41 a complete list of interviewees and secondary sources is available from the authors upon re-\nquest.\n42 martin 1984.\n604 wORLd POLItICS \nthat the delegates of the organizations involved in collective bargaining \nhave the power to conclude agreements on behalf of those organiza-\ntions. therefore decisions concerning collective agreements are left to \nleaders. for an agreement to be adopted, the leaders need to obtain \nthe approval of their organization\u2019s governing body: no rank-and-file \nvote is required. the largest Belgian union, ACv, justifies its governance \nsystem as follows:\n\u201cin the heroic times of the trade union movement . . . leaders were nominated \ndirectly by the members, who selected . . . those who displayed the greatest \ndynamism and the liveliest zeal for trade union interests . . . .

Different from \nmost previous analyses, which focus on a proxy outcome, e.g., unem-\nployment, we use a direct measure of wage moderation, or, conversely, \nwage militancy\u2014the measure of wage in efficiency units (weU) devel-\noped by Olivier Blanchard.46 in our measure, the real (product) wage is \ndivided by an index of total factor productivity (tfP or solow residual), \nwhich captures technical progress, and then further normalized by the \nlabor share.47 the resulting index is a measure of unit labor costs where \nwages are compared with a steady-state rate of labor productivity that \ndepends solely on technological progress and not also on changes in \ncapital intensity. if the index is greater (smaller) than zero, wages grow \nfaster (slower) than technologically determined productivity increases, \nand there is wage militancy (moderation).\nDifferent from other possible measures of wage moderation, e.g., \nunit labor costs, the weU controls for the endogenous impact that real \nwage militancy may have on labor productivity. in the short to me-\ndium run, firms may react to wage militancy by substituting labor with \ncapital, which is likely to lead to increased labor productivity. through \nthis channel, then, wage militancy may generate its own compensating \nproductivity increases.48 By using Blanchard\u2019s measure of weU we avoid \nthese potential problems of endogeneity.49\ntables 2 and 3 begin the analysis with descriptive statistics and sim-\nple cross-tabulations. table 2 displays the average change in the wage \nin efficiency units (1974\u20132000) by average level of contract ratification. \nthe country\/years with no ratification procedure in place display the \nhighest level of wage militancy (0.38 percent). an intermediate level \nof wage militancy (0.14 percent) is associated to intermediate levels of \ncentralization (see below) also coded by golden, lange, and Wallerstein (2006), has no temporal \nvariation at all.\n46 Blanchard 1997; Blanchard 2000, 300\u2013304; Blanchard and Philippon 2004, 3.\n47 formally, this is\n48 Hellwig 2004.\n49 a full discussion of the rationale for the choice of the weU measure and of the assumptions \nunderlying it (within the framework of the solow-swan growth model: Harrod-neutral technological \nprogress and economies on the balanced growth path) is beyond the scope of this paper.

Using this index instead of \na wage centralization index allows us to control for the additional in-\nstitutional characteristics of the wage determination system that are \nincorporated in the coordination construct, i.e., the coordination ca-\npacities of employer associations, as underscored by David soskice.52 \nBargaining coordination has been shown to lead to wage moderation \nbecause it helps collective actors internalize the consequences of their \nwage policies,53 thus a negative sign is expected.\nWe add to this specification, one by one, additional institutional and \norganizational variables that have been argued to affect wage pressure. \nWe first add the confederation hierarchy index illustrated above. if the \nneocorporatist hypothesis were true, the coefficient of this variable \nwould be negative. By including the indicator of contract ratification \nand the indicator of union hierarchy in the same specification, the two \ncompeting hypotheses about the optimal internal structure of union \nconfederations seeking to moderate wage demands are tested simulta-\nneously and their relative weight assessed.\n52 soskice 1990.\n53 see Baccaro and rei 2007, and literature cited therein.\n610 wORLd POLItICS \nanother model includes the union density rate, which should be \npositively associated to wage militancy to the extent that it captures \nthe monopoly power of unions. as an alternative measure of union \npower we use the collective bargaining coverage rate, which can be very \nhigh even when the density rate is low (as in the paradigmatic case of \nfrance) due to legal provisions for contract extension. this variable, \ntoo, should be positively correlated with wage growth.\nan organizational feature that may also affect wage behavior is the \nlevel of interconfederation concentration. it has been argued that the \nmore concentrated the membership of trade unions (ideally within a \nsingle union confederation), the lower the likelihood that the confed-\nerations will engage in leapfrogging and cause a wage-wage spiral.54 a \nnegative sign is therefore expected.\nanother model includes a measure of the hierarchical power of em-\nployer associations, capturing whether employer associations have the \npower to impose particular settlements or decisions on their affiliates. the \nrationale behind including this variable is that wage moderation may not \nonly be a function of the unions\u2019 capacity to exercise internal discipline, \nbut is also, if not more, a function of the employers\u2019 ability to do likewise \nwithin their own ranks.55 still another specification includes a compos-\nite index capturing the extent of government intervention in collective \nbargaining\u2014from noninvolvement, to the setting of minimum wages, \nall the way to the imposition of wage freezes and prohibition of supple-\nmentary local bargaining. the expectation is that higher government \ninvolvement in wage determination will slow down wage growth.\nthe last institutional variable we add is a measure of central bank \nindependence. Various scholars have suggested that a central bank that \nis not accountable to political authorities can induce trade unions to \nmoderate wages at given levels of unemployment by credibly threaten-\ning to deflate the economy.56 Based on this argument, we hypothesize \na negative sign.\nthe vector of macroeconomic and policy controls includes\n\u03a3\nj  \ngj, x j,it = g1URi,t\u20131 + g2 \u0394URi,t\u20131 + g3UNBENi,t + g4 \u0394TAXi,t + g5 TOTSi,t\nwhere ur is the lagged unemployment rate; \u0394ur is the lagged yearly \nchange in unemployment; \u0394tax is the change in taxes, including in-\n54 Carlin and soskice 1990, 113; golden 1993; iversen 1999.\n55 martin 1984; swenson 1991; swank 2001; swank and martin 2001; thelen 2001; swenson \n2002; martin and swank 2004.\n56 scharpf 1991; streeck 1994; Hassel 2003.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 611\ncome and indirect taxes as well as social security contributions on la-\nbor, expressed as percentage of gross domestic product (gdP); unben is \na measure of the generosity of unemployment benefits; tots captures \nterms of trade shocks measured as changes in terms of trade (ratio of \nexport prices to import prices) weighted by the openness of the econ-\nomy (defined as the ratio between imports plus exports to gdP).\nWe expect both higher levels of unemployment rate as well as change \nin unemployment to be conducive to wage moderation (negative sign). \nthe inclusion of the latter term captures the possible nonlinearity of \nthe relationship, which implies that the trade-off between unemploy-\nment and wage growth should become steeper as unemployment in-\ncreases.57 more generous unemployment benefits (replacement rates) \nshould lead to higher wage outcomes (positive sign) at given levels of \nunemployment by increasing the reservation wage of workers and thus \nstrengthening their bargaining power.58 the effect of changes in taxes is \na priori unclear. if there is real wage resistance, i.e., if workers respond \nto changes in labor taxes that lower the take-home wage by pushing \nup the pretax wage, then there should be a positive relationship with \ngwe\u0131. if there is no wage resistance, then the pretax product wage should \nbe unaffected. along similar lines, changes in terms of trade should \nhave a negative sign if there is wage resistance.59\nWe also include two types of interactions. first, we interact contract \nratification with wage bargaining coordination (CR*wBCOOR). this \ntests the hypothesis of complementarity that emerged in the previous \ncross-tabulation of data. We expect a negative sign for the interacted \ncoefficient. the second interaction explores the impact of contract rati-\nfication changes over time. as hypothesized above, the need to demo-\ncratically legitimate the outcomes of peak-level agreements may have \nincreased over time due to the declining availability of side payments \nthat could compensate union members for their short-term losses.60 to \ntest this hypothesis we interact the contract ratification variable with a \nlinear time-trend term (tIMe). We expect this interaction to be nega-\ntive, meaning that the wage-moderating effect of contract ratification \nshould increase over time.61\nWe run various specification and robustness checks in a separate \nsubsection.\n57 layard, nickell, and Jackman 2005, 365.\n58 layard, nickell, and Jackman 2005, 76.\n59 Carlin and soskice 1990, 294\u2013300; layard, nickell, and Jackman 2005, 209\u201310.\n60 mares 2006.\n61 a section describing variables and data sources is omitted due to space constraints. it is available \nfrom the authors upon request.\n612 wORLd POLItICS \neCONOMetRIC ReSULtS\nOrdinary least squares (OLS) with panel-corrected standard errors is our \nestimator of choice.62 it allows us to correct for both country-specific \nheteroskedasticity and spatial correlation of the errors.63 table 4 reports \nregression results.64\nthe regression results fully corroborate our hypotheses. across all \nmodels, the macroeconomic and policy-related variables perform as ex-\npected: high levels of unemployment and of changes in unemployment \ndepress wage growth, while a decline in the price of exports relative to \nimports, high levels of unemployment benefits, and increases in labor \ntaxes push wages (in efficiency units) up.\nOur measure of contract ratification is robustly negatively correlated \nwith the dependent variable (weU), indicating that the more workers \nare involved in ratifying collective agreements, the greater the wage \nmoderation. additionally, and confirming a standard result in the lit-\nerature, wage bargaining coordination is robustly negatively associated \nwith wage militancy. it seems that the more coordinated the bargain-\ning system, the easier it is, all other things being equal, to ensure wage \nmoderation.\nthe clear impact of contract ratification is paired with the absence \nof an impact of union hierarchy (model 2). the coefficient is negative, \nas corporatist theory would predict, but not significantly different from \n0. similarly insignificant are the coefficients of other institutional and \norganizational variables, which might be hypothesized to affect wage \npressure: union density (model 3); the degree of collective bargaining \ncoverage (model 4); the concentration of union confederations (model \n5); the degree of centralization of employer organizations (model 6); \nthe degree of government intervention in wage bargaining (model 7); \nand the degree of central bank independence (model 8).\n62 the hypothesis of no cross-sectional dependence of the errors is rejected (Breusch-Pagan LM \ntest: chi2(120) = 159.392, p = 0.0094). similarly rejected is the hypothesis of homoskedasticity (modi-\nfied Wald test: chi2(16) = 231.51, p = 0.000). We estimate static models because the null hypothesis of \nno serial correlation cannot be rejected at standard levels of confidence. since the result of the Wool-\ndridge test was borderline\u2014f(1, 15) = 3.802, Prob > f = 0.0701\u2014as a further check we estimated a \ndynamic model with the lagged dependent variable among the predictors; the coefficient of this vari-\nable was not significantly different from 0. results are omitted for reasons of space and are available \nfrom the authors upon request.\n63 Beck and Katz 1995.\n64 We did not estimate a two-way fixed-effects model with country dummies as well because an \nf-test of joint significance could not reject the hypothesis that the country fixed effects were jointly \nequal to zero: f(15, 380) = 0.80, Prob > f = 0.6809. the time dummies were instead jointly highly \nsignificant: f(27, 380) = 6.75, Prob > f = 0.0000.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 613\nmodels 9 and 10 include interaction terms. the complementarity \nbetween contract ratification and wage bargaining coordination emerg-\ning by the cross-tabulation of data is confirmed in model 9. the coef-\nficient of the interaction term (CR*wBCOOR) is negative and significant. \nat the same time, the marginal effect of each variable is not signifi-\ncantly different from zero when the value of the other is zero. in other \nwords, in a hypothetical country where no ratification procedures are \nin place and wage bargaining is not coordinated, our estimates suggest \nthat neither a unit increase in wage coordination nor a unit increase in \ncontract ratification would have any significant impact on wages. in \nthis model the sign of the contract ratification coefficient is positive\u2014\nthus providing some support for the corporatist view that worker in-\nvolvement may lead to greater wage militancy, but only when collective \nbargaining is uncoordinated.\nin model 10, we relax the assumption of a constant contract ratifica-\ntion coefficient and explore how it may vary over time. interestingly, \nboth the time trend variable and the interaction between time trend \nand contract ratification (CR*tIMe) are negative and significant. the \ntime trend, which proxies for all trended omitted variables, suggests \nthat there is linear decline in wage militancy over time when other de-\nterminants are controlled for. the interacted coefficient suggests that \nthe wage-moderating effect of contract ratification becomes stronger \nover time. 65\nfigure 1 shows in a 95 percent confidence-level band how the effect \nof contract ratification on wage growth changes over time. this effect \nis significantly negatively different from zero (at 5 percent) starting \nfrom around 1980. We interpret this finding as suggesting that demo-\ncratically legitimating collective agreements become more important as \nwelfare state expansion and other side payments are no longer much of \nan option.66 Procedural legitimation becomes a substitute for outcome \nlegitimation.67\n65 We estimated two further models (not reported for reasons of space, but available from the \nauthors): a model including a dummy variable for european monetary Union (eMU ) countries, and \na model with an interaction between wage coordination and central bank independence. the eMU \ndummy (scoring 1 for eMU

coordination and central bank independence was not only insignificant but also wrongly \n(i.e., positively) signed. this finding seems interesting and worthy of further investigation, as it sug-\ngests that controlling for the previously overlooked process of contract ratification (which according to \nour argument helps union confederations moderate their wage demands), the much discussed wage-\ndampening effect of the combination between independent central bank, and coordinated bargaining \ndisappears.\n66 Pizzorno 1978b; Katzenstein 1985; Pierson 2001; mares 2006.\n67

additional regression results. first, we estimate models \nthat include different operationalizations of our key independent vari-\nables, contract ratification and wage bargaining coordination

model with averaged data \n(model 4). fourth, we estimate two models (5 and 6) in which our key \nindependent variables are lagged. and fifth, we consider models with \na different operationalization of the dependent variable: model 7 does \nnot include the interaction between contract ratification and wage co-\nordination; model 8 does.\nOur conclusions hold even if we weigh both contract ratification \nand wage coordination by the degree of collective bargaining cover-\nage (model 1). the reasoning behind this choice is that the impact of \nparticular institutional features is likely to be contingent on the overall \nimportance of collective bargaining in a particular country (captured \nby the bargaining coverage rate). the impact of the contract ratifica-\nfIgURe 1 \neffeCt Of

costs, where w (wage), L (labor), Y \n(product).\ntion and wage bargaining coordination variables on wage growth may \nbe different between countries with high and low coverage. However, \nthe two institutional measures remain significant predictors of wage \ntrends. in model 2 we substitute the measure of wage coordination \nwith a measure of wage centralization. the contract ratification coef-\nficient is still significant but its magnitude is smaller and the standard \nerror larger. While the measures of wage bargaining centralization and \nwage coordination are highly correlated (r = 0.80), contract ratification \nis (by construction) more highly correlated with wage centralization \n(r=0 .41) than with wage coordination (r = 0.24). it is therefore more \ndifficult for OLS to sort out the respective contributions of wage cen-\ntralization and contract ratification to movements in wages.\nWe then estimate a reduced-form model, omitting the two controls \nfor the unemployment rate (model 3). this is intended as a further \ncheck on possible endogeneity problems (in addition to using one-year \nlags of the unemployment controls). in other words, it may be sus-\npected that the unemployment rate responds to wage growth in ef-\nficiency units. after omitting these terms the two institutional pre-\ndictors (contract ratification and wage coordination) continue to have \nnegative and significant coefficients. model 4 runs an estimate using \nthree-year averaged data.68 all results are confirmed.\nOur results are likewise confirmed if we lag contract ratification and \nwage coordination by three or four years (model 5 and model 6, re-\nspectively). these tests rule out the possibility of reversed causation \nbetween wage moderation and the institutional variables, i.e., that the \nneed to reduce wage militancy leads to an increase in bargaining coor-\ndination and contract ratification rather than vice versa.\nWe then estimate the model with macroeconomic controls and in-\nstitutional predictors using a different operationalization of the depen-\ndent variable\u2014the wage share. the reason for this choice is twofold. \nfirst, the wage share is essentially a measure of unit labor costs; it is a \nstandard (albeit less refined) proxy for wage militancy.69 second, the \nmeasure allows us to estimate a model where both the left-hand side \nand the right-hand side of the equation are expressed in levels. Unfor-\ntunately, data on wages in efficiency units are only available as an index \nnumber, thus making it inevitable to express the dependent variable as \nchange. regression coefficients support our previous conclusions. in \nt\nA\nB\nL\ne\n 5\nSP\ne\nC\nIf\nIC\nA\nt\nIO\nN\n A\nN\nd\n R\nO\nB\nU\nSt\nN\ne\nSS\n C\nh\ne\nC\nk\nSa\nM\nod\nel\n 1\n \nc\nr\n a\nnd\n  \nw\nb\nc\no\no\nr\n \nW\nei\ngh\nte\nd \nby\n \nC\nol\nle\nct\niv\ne \nB\nar\nga\nin\nin\ng \nC\nov\ner\nag\ne\nM\nod\nel\n 2\n  \n \nW\nag\ne \nB\nar\nga\nin\nin\ng \nC\nen\ntr\nal\niz\nat\nio\nn \nIn\nst\nea\nd \nof\n \nw\nb\nc\no\no\nr\n \nM\nod\nel\n 3\n  \n    \nR\ned\nuc\ned\n   \nFo\nrm\nM\nod\nel\n 4\n  \n   \nT\nhr\nee\n-Y\nea\nr \nA\nve\nra\nge\nd\nD\nat\na \nM\nod\nel\n 5\n \n  \nc\nr\n a\nnd\n \nw\nb\nc\no\no\nr\n  \nL\nag\nge\nd \nby\n  \nT\nhr\nee\n Y\nea\nrs\nM\nod\nel\n 6\n  \nc\nr\n a\nnd\n  \nw\nb\nc\no\no\nr\n  \nL\nag\nge\nd \nby\n  \nFo\nur\n Y\nea\nrs\nM\nod\nel\n 7\n  \n   \nA\nlte\nrn\nat\ne \nD\nep\nen\nde\nnt\n \nVa\nri\nab\nle\n \nM\nod\nel\n 8\n \nA\nlte\nrn\nat\ne \nD\nep\nen\nde\nnt\n \nVa\nri\nab\nle\nIn\nclu\ndi\nng\n \nc\nr\n*w\nb\nc\no\no\nr\n \nIn\nte\nra\nct\nio\nn\nD\nep\nen\nde\nnt\n v\nar\nia\nbl\neb\ng\nw\ne\nU\ng\nw\ne\nU\ng\nw\ne\nU\ng\nw\ne\nU\ng\nw\ne\nU\ng\nw\ne\nU\nA\nw\nS\nA\nw\nS\nC\non\ntr\nac\nt r\nat\nifi\nca\ntio\nn \n(C\nR\n) w\nei\ngh\nte\nd\n\u20130\n.0\n06\n45\n**\n(0\n.0\n02\n56\n)\nC\noo\nrd\nin\nat\nio\nn \nof\n w\nag\ne \nba\nrg\nai\nni\nng\n\u20130\n.0\n03\n04\n**\n \n(w\nB\nC\nO\nO\nR\n) w\nei\ngh\nte\nd\n(0\n.0\n01\n40\n)\nC\nR\n\u20130\n.4\n23\n**\n\u20130\n.4\n36\n**\n\u20130\n.4\n58\n**\n\u20131\n.7\n84\n**\n*\n2.\n57\n2*\n**\n(0\n.2\n07\n)\n(0\n.1\n94\n)\n(0\n.2\n21\n)\n(0\n.1\n4)\n(0\n.4\n49\n)\nw\nB\nC\nO\nO\nR\n\u20130\n.4\n17\n*\n\u20130\n.6\n35\n**\n\u20130\n.1\n41\n1.\n50\n3*\n**\n(0\n.2\n20\n)\n(0\n.3\n08\n)\n(0\n.2\n04\n)\n(0\n.1\n93\n)\nC\nR\n+\n\u20130\n.5\n40\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.5\n66\n**\n*\n(0\n.2\n05\n)\n(0\n.2\n19\n)\nw\nB\nC\nO\nO\nR\n+\n\u20130\n.6\n24\n**\n\u20130\n.4\n95\n**\n(0\n.2\n52\n)\n(0\n.2\n52\n)\nC\nR\n*w\nB\nC\nO\nO\nR\n\u20133\n.1\n23\n**\n*\n(0\n.3\n23\n)\nW\nag\ne \nba\nrg\nai\nni\nng\n c\nen\ntr\nal\niz\nat\nio\nn\n\u20130\n.2\n98\n**\n(0\n.1\n40\n)\nU\nne\nm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt r\nat\ne \n(la\ngg\ned\n)\n\u20130\n.1\n43\n**\n\u20130\n.1\n30\n**\n\u20130\n.1\n55\n*\n\u20130\n.1\n36\n**\n\u20130\n.1\n21\n*\n\u20130\n.1\n45\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.1\n18\n**\n*\n(0\n.0\n63\n2)\n(0\n.0\n64\n6)\n(0\n.0\n82\n6)\n(0\n.0\n61\n5)\n(0\n.0\n62\n5)\n(0\n.0\n44\n8)\n(0\n.0\n42\n7)\nC\nha\nng\ne \nin\n u\nne\nm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt (\nla\ngg\ned\n)\n\u20130\n.8\n41\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.8\n22\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.6\n94\n**\n\u20130\n.7\n20\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.6\n75\n**\n*\n0.\n15\n5\n\u20130\n.0\n07\n74\n(0\n.1\n96\n)\n(0\n.2\n00\n)\n(0\n.3\n37\n)\n(0\n.2\n09\n)\n(0\n.2\n17\n)\n(0\n.1\n82\n)\n(0\n.1\n50\n)\nC\nha\nng\ne \nin\n ta\nxe\ns\n1.\n32\n0*\n**\n1.\n33\n8*\n**\n1.\n42\n1*\n**\n1.\n62\n9*\n**\n1.\n27\n8*\n**\n1.\n22\n9*\n**\n0.\n43\n4*\n*\n0.\n35\n3*\n*\n(0\n.1\n98\n)\n(0\n.2\n01\n)\n(0\n.2\n06\n)\n(0\n.3\n88\n)\n(0\n.2\n11\n)\n(0\n.2\n18\n)\n(0\n.2\n02\n)\n(0\n.1\n74\n)\nU\nne\nm\npl\noy\nm\nen\nt b\nen\nefi\nts\n0.\n02\n15\n0.\n02\n37\n*\n0.\n01\n77\n0.\n02\n40\n*\n0.\n02\n13\n0.\n01\n86\n0.\n02\n70\n**\n*\n0.\n02\n23\n**\n(0\n.0\n13\n6)\n(0\n.0\n13\n8)\n(0\n.0\n12\n7)\n(0\n.0\n12\n9)\n(0\n.0\n13\n8)\n(0\n.0\n14\n6)\n(0\n.0\n08\n57\n)\n(0\n.0\n10\n6)\nt\ner\nm\ns \nof\n tr\nad\ne \nsh\noc\nks\n\u20131\n.3\n47\n**\n*\n\u20131\n.3\n50\n**\n*\n\u20131\n.4\n19\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.9\n25\n**\n\u20131\n.3\n52\n**\n*\n\u20131\n.3\n50\n**\n*\n\u20130\n.5\n58\n**\n\u20130\n.4\n50\n**\n(0\n.1\n86\n)\n(0\n.1\n90\n)\n(0\n.2\n01\n)\n(0\n.3\n60\n)\n(0\n.2\n12\n)\n(0\n.2\n19\n)\n(0\n.2\n68\n)\n(0\n.2\n08\n)\nC\non\nst\nan\nt\n4.\n23\n5*\n**\n4.\n28\n2*\n**\n3.\n52\n6*\n**\n4.\n75\n6*\n**\n\u20130\n.4\n5\n\u20130\n.5\n61\n72\n.2\n1*\n**\n70\n.3\n3*\n**\n(0\n.5\n76\n)\n(0\n.5\n87\n)\n(0\n.5\n29\n)\n(0\n.5\n84\n)\n(0\n.6\n97\n)\n(0\n.7\n06\n)\n(0\n.5\n95\n)\n(0\n.5\n11\n)\nO\nbs\ner\nva\ntio\nns\n42\n6\n42\n9\n42\n9\n14\n3\n38\n1\n36\n5\n42\n9\n42\n9\nn\num\nbe\nr o\nf c\nou\nnt\nri\nes\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\n16\nr\n-s\nqu\nar\ned\n0.\n51\n6\n0.\n51\n4\n0.\n47\n7\n0.\n62\n0\n0.\n45\n9\n0.\n45\n5\n0.\n47\n3\n0.\n58\n4\nC\noe\nffi\nci\nen\nts\n o\nf t\n-1\n ti\nm\ne \ndu\nm\nm\nie\ns \nar\ne \nom\nitt\ned\n d\nue\n to\n s\npa\nce\n c\non\nst\nra\nin\nts\n, b\nut\n a\nre\n in\ncl\nud\ned\n in\n a\nll \nth\ne \nes\ntim\nat\nes\n;

On the contrary, it seems to increase the \nwage share. it is only the combination of the two variables that matters \nfor labor cost containment. this confirms that wage coordination and \ncontract ratification are complements.\nfinally, in table 6 we estimate a number of purely cross-sectional \nspecifications.70 the \u201cbetween estimator\u201d is in all likelihood not the \nmost appropriate for testing a model in which contract ratification is \ninteracted with wage coordination, which varies more within countries \nthan between. nevertheless, this extreme test addresses the problem of \nthe nearly time-invariant contract ratification variable. the dependent \nvariable is the average annual change of wage in efficiency units. Our \nindependent variables are also averaged. With only sixteen observa-\ntions, one per country in the sample, we include only our most impor-\ntant institutional predictors: contract ratification, wage coordination, \nand their interaction. the macroeconomic controls are not expected \nto have any impact on the long-run rate of growth of the wage in ef-\nficiency units, so they are excluded. We estimate models for the overall \nperiod 1974\u20132000 (models 1 and 2); for 1974\u201389 (models 3 and 4); \nand for 1989\u20132000 (models 5 and 6). in other words, we distinguish \nbetween the period of classic political exchange following the two oil \ncrises (1974\u201389) and the age of new social pacts (1990\u20132000) in which \ntrade unions were no longer compensated for wage moderation through \nside payments.71\nthe results of cross-sectional regressions are less straightforward than \nthose of the time-series cross-sectional analysis, but overall are in line \nwith them. even with only sixteen observations, contract ratification \nemerges as the most important institutional predictor of wage mod-\neration. its coefficients for the entire period 1974\u20132000 are negative \nand significant (models 1 and 2). Controlling for contract ratification, \n70 We also performed (but do not present here) a jackknife analysis (excluding one country at a \ntime) on the model presented in table 4, column 1. this suggested that the model is robust to pres-\nence or absence of particular countries in the sample. in particular, the two institutional variables, \nwage coordination and contract ratification, do not depend on any particular country for statistical \nsignificance.\n71 regini 1997; Wallerstein, golden, and lange 1997; Perez 2000; Compston 2002; Culpepper \n2002; molina and rhodes 2002; traxler 2004; Hassel 2006; Hamann and Kelly 2007; avdagic 2010.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 621\nthe degree of wage bargaining coordination (i.e., the institution all \nprevious literature has focused on) is not significantly associated with \nwage moderation in the 1974\u20132000 regressions. the coefficients of \nboth contract ratification and wage coordination are positive albeit in-\nsignificant in the 1974\u201389 period (models 3 and 4). this is strange but \nnot completely unexpected since the results shown in figure 1 (which \nis derived from table 4, model 10) indicate that the impact of contract \nratification becomes significantly different from zero only in the 1980s. \nthe same coefficients are negative and significant in the period 1990\u2013\n2000 (the era of new social pacts).72 additionally, in the 1990\u20132000 \n72 in the interacted models, each of the variables in the interactive term is expressed as deviation \nfrom the sample mean. this allows one to interpret the direct effects of contract ratification and co-\nordination of wage bargaining in the interacted models as referring to the average country (for which \nthe interacted term is zero).\ntABLe 6\nCROSS-SeCtIONAL RegReSSIONS IN dIffeReNt PeRIOdSa\nModel 1 \n \nBaseline\n1974\u20132000 \nModel 2\n1974\u20132000 \nwith\ncr*wbcoor \nInteraction \nModel 3 \n \nBaseline\n1974\u20131989 \nModel 4\n1974\u20131989 \nwith\ncr*wbcoor \nInteraction \nModel 5 \n \nBaseline\n1990\u20132000 \nModel 6\n1990\u20132000 \nwith\ncr*wbcoor \nInteraction \nContract \u20130.430** \u20130.381* 0.0638 0.0588 \u20131.030*** \u20130.700**\n ratification  \n (CR)\n(0.171) (0.199) (0.119) (0.149) (0.288) (0.248)\nCoordination  \nof wage \nbargaining \n(wBCOOR)\n0.0368\n(0.135)\n\u20130.0404\n(0.175)\n0.211\n(0.149)\n0.219 \n(0.196)\n\u20130.388\n(0.283)\n\u20130.675**\n(0.250)\nCR*wBCOOR  \u20130.197  0.0190  \u20131.011***\n  (0.241)  (0.250)  (0.325)\nConstant 0.330** 0.405* 0.140 0.133 0.727** 0.987***\n (0.143) (0.190) (0.158) (0.208) (0.325) (0.243)\nObservations 16 16 16 16 16 16\nr-squared 0.407 0.425 0.130 0.130 0.652 0.790\nDependent variable: growth of wages in efficiency units yearly average; all models are robust to a \njackknife test done by excluding one country at the time; each of the variables interacted is expressed \nas deviation from the sample mean, i.e., the direct effects of contract ratification and coordination \nof wage bargaining in the interacted models can be interpreted as referring to the average country; \n(White-) robust standard errors in parentheses; *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1\na all models are OLS estimations.\n622 wORLd POLItICS \nperiod there is a strong complementarity between these institutions \n(models 5 and 6).73\nthe finding that contract ratification and wage coordination are not \nassociated with wage moderation in the 1974\u201389 period may be a sta-\ntistical incident and we do not put much store on it, especially since it \ncontradicts both the theory and the practice of institutionalized wage \nmoderation in this period. nevertheless, it may indicate that the wage \nmoderating effects of contract ratification, wage coordination, and their \ninteraction apply only to the 1990s and not to the preceding period.74\nto summarize, the econometric analysis reveals a new, previously \noverlooked correlation between wage moderation and the internal gov-\nernance processes of trade union confederations. it also suggests that \nworker involvement in contract ratification and collective bargaining \ncoordination are complements: each individually reduces wage mili-\ntancy (all other things being equal) and together they magnify each \nother\u2019s effect. the effect is particularly robust in the 1990\u20132000 pe-\nriod\u2014an era in which trade union moderation was no longer compen-\nsated by sizeable side-payments.\nthis article next examines the mechanisms underlying the statistical \ncorrelations uncovered through large-N analysis. We argue that statisti-\ncal analysis is indispensable to uncovering relationships of covariation \namong variables, but needs to be complemented by a narrative that \nillustrates the generative processes by which, through the actions and \ninteractions of human agents, such relationships are produced.75 We \nfocus on developments in ireland and italy. these are the only two \ncountries in our sample in which the index of contract ratification in-\ncreases over time. they are also the two countries in which the index \nof collective bargaining coordination increases the most between the \n1980s and 1990s. in brief, they are the two cases that most clearly ex-\nemplify the institutional interaction between bargaining coordination \nand contract ratification highlighted by the econometric analysis.\n73 in another test, we have added one by one to each cross-sectional model all the institutional \nvariables that we have tested in the time-series cross-section analysis (see table 4). none of the in-\nstitutional variables reached significance at standard levels in any of the three time periods, barring \ngovernment intervention, which reached significance at 5 percent in the model for 1974\u20132000 (al-\nthough with a sign opposite to expectations), and union density, positive as expected and significant at \n1 percent in the model for 1974\u201389.\n74 We also performed (but do not present here) a jackknife analysis on the model presented in table \n6, column 6. results held when the model was reestimated excluding one country at a time.\n75 esser 1996; goldthorpe 2001, 3; Hedstr\u00f6m 2005; elster 2007.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 623\nwAge BARgAININg ANd UNION gOveRNANCe IN IReLANd  \nANd ItALy\nDuring the 1990s, ireland and italy experienced a dramatic transfor-\nmation of their wage determination systems. Beginning in late 1987, \nireland moved from an essentially decentralized enterprise-based col-\nlective bargaining system to a completely centralized and coordinated \nsystem, thanks to a succession of seven centralized pacts involving gov-\nernment, employers, and unions, each lasting three years. these pacts \nregulated wage dynamics in all sectors simultaneously. they also deter-\nmined exactly what percentage increases, if any at all, could be negoti-\nated at the peripheral levels.\nin italy, too, the 1990s were the decade of centralized bargaining. a \ncentralized agreement abolished wage indexation in 1992 and banned \nenterprise-level bargaining. in 1993, government, employers, and \nunions agreed to a new architecture of collective bargaining in which \nindustry-level bargaining (every two years) was tightly linked to gov-\nernment inflation targets and assigned the role of protecting real wages \nagainst purchasing-power erosion, while enterprise-level bargaining \n(every four years) was to redistribute productivity increases. this bar-\ngaining system was the object of new negotiations in 1998, which con-\nfirmed its dual structure.\nthe emergence of centralized institutions in ireland and italy oc-\ncurred despite the apparently inhospitable institutional and organiza-\ntional characteristics of the two countries, at least according to prevailing \nscholarly views. in 1988, an irish scholar wrote that \u201cthe organizational \nand political conditions which would tend to be conducive to sustain-\ning neo-corporatist agreements were not well developed in ireland, \ntherefore concertative wage bargaining could not develop very far. in \nparticular, the trade union movement\u2019s authoritative centralization was \nlimited, and it was constrained in its ability to devise a central strategy \nand secure the compliance of all affiliates.\u201d76 similar judgments were \noften expressed about italy. indeed, italy was constantly ranked at or \nnear the bottom of the various indexes of corporatism and regarded as \na problem case among advanced nations.\nin both countries union structure remained relatively fragmented \nin comparative perspective.77 in terms of processes, both union move-\n76 Hardiman 1988, 3.\n77 in ireland (but not in italy), the ICtU increased its internal concentration through union merg-\ners. there were fifteen such mergers between 1985 and 1989, and seventeen between 1990 and 1994 \n(roche and ashmore 2002, table 5). With fifty-two unions affiliated to the ICtU in 1995, the irish \nlabor movement was still more fragmented than most.\n624 wORLd POLItICS \nments stepped up their levels of organizational democracy as they ar-\nranged extensive consultations of union members (as well as of non-\nmembers in italy) combined with binding workers\u2019 referendums on \nkey collective agreements. in ireland, the practice of balloting became \nmore prevalent in the 1990s\u2014it was less widely practiced before then, \nwhen consultations were more informal.78 to understand how these in-\nternal organizational processes helped confederation leaders mobilize \ninternal consensus for policies that were not immediately perceived as \nbeneficial by the union constituency, we focus on the formative mo-\nments of wage bargaining coordination in both countries.\nthe INStItUtIONALIzAtION Of COORdINAted BARgAININg\nin ireland the first centralized pact, the Program for national recovery \n(PNR) of 1987, was the most politically contested of the lot. the lead-\ners of the irish Confederation of trade Unions (ICtU) were favorably \ninclined towards it\u2014the country faced a serious macroeconomic crisis, \nand they were concerned that the government might respond thatcher-\nstyle with an all-out attack on trade unions.79 in particular, public sector \nunions were afraid they would fare especially poorly in free-for-all bar- \ngaining, given the government\u2019s emphasis on cutting expenditures.80\nthe various unions affiliated to the ICtU had, however, mixed feel-\nings. in particular, the craft unions (representing skilled workers in \nthe private sector) were against the PNR because they perceived de-\ncentralized bargaining as more advantageous for them. among gen-\neral unions, the two largest\u2014the irish transport and general Workers \nUnion (ItgwU) and the federated Workers Union of ireland (fwUI) \n\u2014supported the deal. the third largest general union, the amalgam-\nated transport and general Workers Union (AtgwU), was adamantly \nopposed to it. as stated above, public sector unions generally favored \nthe agreement.\naware of the controversial status of the proposed PNR, the ICtU en-\ngaged in a highly proceduralized decision-making process that relied \non electoral rules similar to those used to elect the american president. \nif 50 percent plus one voter in a union chose to support the option to \n78 interviews by Baccaro with esther lynch, ICtU legislation and social affairs officer, ireland, June \n8, 2007; and with Patricia O\u2019Donovan, former deputy secretary general of the ICtU, geneva, april 9, \n2001; field research.\n79 interviews by Baccaro with Bill attley, former general secretary of the fwUI and the services, \nindustrial, Professional, and technical Union (SIPtU), Bundoran, ireland, July 3, 2001; and with Da-\nvid Begg, ICtU general secretary, Bundoran, ireland, July 4, 2001.\n80 interview by Baccaro with Peter mcloonne, general secretary of IMPACt, Bundoran, ireland, \nJuly 4, 2001.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 625\nendorse (or reject) the PNR agreement, all the delegates of that union \nvoted for (or against) that option in a national convention especially \nsummoned. as with the american process, the rule implied that the \nICtU could end up pursuing a policy that was supported by less than a \nmajority of workers if the larger unions approved it by close margins \n(as they did) while the smaller unions rejected it by larger margins. \nHowever, this possibility did not detract from the legitimacy of the \ncollective decision to support the PNR. the unions that lost the vote did \nnot secede or mobilize to pursue their own independent wage policy; \nthey all abided by the will of the majority.\nmost of the fifty-six unions attending the special conference on the \nPNR voted against the agreement, with the largest unions conducting \nworker ballots to decide how to allocate their votes. the ItgwU, the larg-\nest union of all, had forty-eight delegates and its votes were crucial. it \nran a ballot of its members and the PNR passed by only 400 votes.81 the \nunion convention then approved the agreement with 181 votes to 114.\nin italy, the union decision to engage in centralized bargaining was \nalso highly controversial. the internal process was remarkably similar \nto the irish case because in italy, too, the unions relied on organiza-\ntional referenda to mobilize consensus among the workers. the 1992 \ntripartite agreement abolishing wage indexation provoked a major cri-\nsis in the unions, especially within the largest confederation, the italian \ngeneral Confederation of labor (CgIL). in the fall of 1992 numerous \nfactory councils mobilized against the abolition of the popular wage \nindexation mechanism (scala mobile). interestingly, protesters focused \njust as much on the content of the agreement (which, of course, they \nrejected) as on the decision-making process. Because the agreement \nhad not been preceded by a consultation of the workers affected, they \nclaimed it was illegitimate and unrepresentative of the workers\u2019 will.82\nitalian union leaders learned the lesson. the 1993 agreement, unlike \nits 1992 analogue, was preceded by a binding referendum among the \nworkers\u2014a first in the history of the italian labor movement. With \nthe grassroots mobilization that had taken place one year earlier fresh \nin their minds, the confederation leaders asked for and obtained from \ntheir bargaining counterparts sufficient time to organize a secret ballot \n81 interview by Baccaro with Bill attley, former general secretary of the fwUI and SIPtU, Bun-\ndoran, ireland, July 3, 2001.\n82 interviews by Baccaro with tino magni, secretary general of the federazione impiegati Operai \nmetalmeccanici (fIOM), sesto san giovanni, italy, June 3, 1997; with edoardo Bano, head of organi-\nzation, labor Chamber of Bergamo, Bergamo, italy, June 9, 1997; and with savino Pezzotta, secretary \ngeneral of the italian Confederation of trade Unions, milan, italy, June 10, 1997.\n626 wORLd POLItICS \namong the rank-and-file workers. although the tentative agreement \nbetween the government, employers, and union leaders was reached \non July 3, 1993, the actual agreement was not signed until July 23. in \nthe intervening twenty days, the confederation unions set up approxi-\nmately 30,000 assemblies in the country\u2019s major plants and offices to \nexplain the agreement. While 1.5 million workers participated in the \nvote and 68 percent of them approved the agreement, the consultation \nidentified large pockets of dissent. the employees of some historic au-\ntomotive plants\u2014alfa arese near milan, mirafiori in turin, and OM \niveco in Brescia, for example\u2014voted against the accord (sometimes \noverwhelmingly). the majority of workers in the cities of milan and \nBrescia\u2014two strongholds of the italian labor movement\u2014also rejected \nthe accord.\nthe history of the italian labor movement features several examples \nof rank-and-file mobilization against union policies that were per-\nceived as too moderate, particularly by industrial workers. in the past, \nsimilar mobilization had all but quashed analogous attempts at collec-\ntive bargaining reform.83 this time, however, the dissenting groups did \nnot openly mobilize even though their inaction did not reflect approval \nof the agreement. for example, the essere sindacato faction (the hard \nliners) within the CgIL declared well before the conclusion of the 1993 \nnegotiation that the forthcoming compromise looked \u201cawful\u201d and that \n\u201cit would be a mistake to reach an agreement.\u201d84 similarly, the la-\nbor Chamber of Brescia promised \u201ca new Hot autumn.\u201d85 However, \nthe situation was procedurally different than it had been in 1992. the \nagreement contained two important responses to the procedural cri-\ntique previously raised by the dissident factions. first, it institutional-\nized the regular election of workplace representatives. second, it was \naccompanied by a binding consultation among the workers. although \nthey clearly frowned on the agreement\u2019s content, the dissident groups \nconcentrated their energies not on organizing grassroots protest but \nrather on dissuading workers in the assemblies from approving the \nagreement.\nsome of these groups had something to say about the process. a \nfew, for example, complained that \u201cin the assemblies, only union lead-\ners who were in favor of the agreement [were] allowed to speak.\u201d86 Yet, \n83 lange and Vannicelli 1982; golden 1988.\n84 Il Sole-24 Ore, June 18, 1993.\n85 Il Manifesto, July 10, 1993.\n86 Il Sole-24 Ore, July 23, 1993.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 627\nin the end, none contested the outcome of the consultation, that is, the \nclear endorsement of the July 1993 agreement by the majority of the \nitalian workers.\nMeChANISMS Of CONSeNSUS MOBILIzAtION\nUnion leaders have a number of options when faced with the need to \npush through a bargaining policy that meets with less than enthusias-\ntic approval from their constituencies. they can try to impose it upon \nthose constituencies if institutional and organizational conditions allow \nthem to do so. this is the neocorporatist recipe. alternatively, they can \ncompensate losers with side payments. this option was increasingly \nimpracticable in the 1990s. indeed, national bargaining was not made \nsmoother in either ireland or italy by an increase in public expendi-\ntures. On the contrary, one of the explicit goals of national bargaining \nwas to limit such growth.87\nanother possibility is for union leaders to assuage internal ten-\nsions by scaling up bargaining demands. in this case, internal cohesion \nwould probably be more easily preserved than in the case of hierarchi-\ncal imposition but (to the extent that unions have market power\u2014the \nassumption guiding this and other studies) at the cost of greater wage \nmilitancy. still another option is for union leaders to rely on procedural \nmechanisms to try and persuade dissenting worker groups to go along \nwith a bargaining strategy they do not necessarily like.\nthis last approach was adopted by union leaders in ireland and italy. \nin both case studies it looks as if a majority of workers favored the \nmoderate bargaining policies proposed by confederation leaders. How-\never, implementing a centralized wage policy implied circumventing a \nvocal internal faction that claimed to be representative, particularly in \nthe italian case, of the whole working class. this radical faction had \nconsiderable mobilization capacities and, in the italian case at least, it \nhad previously blocked prior experiments with centralized bargaining.\nthe adoption of majority rule as a decision-making principle leveled \nout the different degrees of intensity of the workers\u2019 preferences.88 the \nvote of workers who were more likely to engage in collective action \ncounted as much as that of more quiescent workers in determining \ncollective decisions. the fact that the radical factions did not mobilize \nagainst the outcome of the vote may reflect a procedural justice effect \nas described by social psychologists, i.e., an increased willingness to \n87 Baccaro and simoni 2007; roche 2007.\n88 Dahl 1956.\n628 wORLd POLItICS \ngo along with unfavorable outcomes if the process that has generated \nthem can be perceived as procedurally fair.89\nalthough we assume that a favorable majority towards centralized \nwage regulation was already in re and that the democratic process \nsimply facilitated its emergence, we cannot exclude that the process \nof debate preceding the vote (in union assemblies) contributed to the \ncreation of such a favorable majority. indeed, in a companion paper we \npresent microevidence that this may be the case based on a representa-\ntive random sample of italian workers covering both those who en-\ngaged and those who did not engage in a union referendum.90 in other \nwords, leaders may have been able to convince at least some workers \nthat wage moderation was in their best interest by using the force of \nargument and persuasion.91\nthe evidence suggests that worker ballots augmented the credibility \nof confederation leaders and weakened the resistance of militant groups \nby providing clear evidence that the choice of moderate wage demands \nwas not an arbitrary imposition of self-interested union bureaucrats but \nwas supported by the majority of workers. these legitimacy resources \nsubstituted for waning material compensation and facilitated internal \ncompliance with peak-level stipulations.\nCONCLUdINg ReMARkS\nthis article deals with a classic theme in the literature on comparative \npolitical economy: understanding what impact particular collective bar-\ngaining institutions have on a country\u2019s economic performance. We fo-\ncus on wage moderation (measured as wage growth in efficiency units) \nas the most direct link between the functioning of a national industrial-\nrelations system and economic outcomes. econometric analysis shows \nthat worker involvement in the ratification of collective agreements is \nassociated with wage moderation, especially in the 1990s. in addition, \nit is a complement to coordinated wage bargaining (the institutional \ncharacteristic all previous literature has focused upon)\u2014the stronger \nthe involvement of workers in contract ratification, the stronger the ef-\nfect of coordinated wage bargaining on dampening wage growth.\nthe case studies of ireland and italy highlight, in turn, that wage \n89 lind and tyler 1988.\n90 Baccaro 2010.\n91 an italian trade union leader argued that union assemblies have the capacity to change about 20 \npercent of the workers\u2019 preferences (interview with Carlo spreafico, milan, italy, June 16, 1997). see \nalso Habermas 1984.\n deteRMINANtS Of wAge MOdeRAtION 629\npolicies are the result of a heated internal political process within union \nconfederations involving groups with different views about bargaining \nstrategy and feasible wage demands. the case studies also show that \nunions that go through a process of democratic legitimation are able \nto reconcile conflicting internal claims at lower levels of wage demands \nthan unions whose leaders make decisions autonomously.\nWe conclude with a few cautionary notes on the view that wage \nmoderation is unequivocally a good thing for a country\u2019s economic \nperformance. it is generally assumed that wage moderation increases \nemployment by pushing the wage-setting curve rightward. However, \nconsidering the irish and italian cases, the argument for a positive link-\nage between wage moderation and unemployment reduction is only \nvalid for the former country. Wage militancy and unemployment both \ndeclined dramatically in ireland after the introduction of centralized \nbargaining in late 1987. a look at the italian case reveals the relation-\nship is not as clear-cut. Wages slowed down considerably in italy after \nthe abolition of wage indexation in 1992, but unemployment contin-\nued to rise for several years.\nthis contrast suggests that the impact of wage moderation is possibly \ncontingent on the particular growth path of a country and that lower \ngrowth of wages in efficiency units may translate into lower unemploy-\nment only in countries such as ireland, in which foreign demand is by \nfar the most important component of aggregate demand.92 in countries \nwith large domestic markets, like italy, the impact of wage moderation \non external competitiveness may be counterbalanced by lower domestic \ndemand and overall lower aggregate demand. this, however, is a topic \nfor another paper.\nRefeReNCeS\narmingeon, Klaus. 1986. \u201cformation and stability of neo-Corporatist incomes \nPolicies: a Comparative analysis.\u201d European Sociological Review 2, no. 2: 138\u2013\n47.\navdagic, sabina. 2010. \u201cWhen are Concerted reforms feasible? explaining the \nemergence of social Pacts in Western europe.\u201d Comparative Political Studies \n43, no. 5: 628\u201357.\nBaccaro, lucio. 2003. \u201cWhat is Dead and What is alive in the theory of Corpo-\nratism.\u201d British Journal of Industrial Relations 4, no. 4: 683\u2013706.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 . 2010. \u201cCorporatism, Democracy, and the Construction of interests: les-\nsons from the italian Pension reform.\u201d Paper presented at the Council for \n92 see soskice 2007; Carlin and soskice 2009.\n630 wORLd POLItICS \neuropean studies seventeenth international Conference, montreal, Canada, \napril 15\u201317.\nBaccaro, lucio, and Diego rei. 2007. \u201cinstitutional Determinants of Unemploy-\nment in OeCD Countries: Does the Deregulatory View Hold Water?\u201d Inter-\nnational Organization 61, no. 3: 527\u201369.\nBaccaro, lucio, and marco simoni. 2007. \u201cCentralized Wage Bargaining and the \n\u2018Celtic tiger\u2019 Phenomenon.\u201d Industrial Relations, 46, no. 3: 426\u201355.\nBarabas, Jason. 2004. \u201cHow Deliberation affects Policy Opinions.\u201d American Po-\nlitical Science Review 98, no. 4: 687\u2013701.\nBeck, nathaniel, and Jonathan n.
