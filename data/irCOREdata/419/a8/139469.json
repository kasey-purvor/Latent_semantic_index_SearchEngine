What techniques have been employed? What are the \nmain findings and achievements up to date? What are the major obstacles that have ever been \nencountered and how might they be overcome?   \n \nThis paper is organised in five sections. Subsequent to the introduction in the first section, the soft \ncomputing and supply chain management techniques are briefed in the second and third section. The \nfourth section describes the research methodology used in this paper. The fifth section examines the \nexisting research of applying soft computing techniques to a variety of fields in supply chain \nmanagement. Then the key findings are concluded. Finally, a summary of existing studies and a \ndiscussion on the future research directions are provided. \n \n2. Soft computing \nSoft computing is a group of unique methodologies, contributed mainly by Expert System (ES), \nFuzzy Logic (FL), Neural Networks (NN), and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), which provide flexible \ninformation processing capabilities to solve real-life problems. The advantages of employing soft \ncomputing is its capability to tolerate imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to achieve tractability \nand robustness on simulating human decision-making behaviour with low cost (Pal and Ghosh, 2004). \nIn other words, soft computing provides the opportunity to represent ambiguity in human thinking with \nthe uncertainty in real life (Roy et al., 1999). The major soft computing techniques are briefed as \nfollowing. \n2.1. Fuzzy Logic \nFuzzy set theory was initiated by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965. In the 1970s a complete theory of evidence \ndealing with information from multiple sources was produced by Glenn Shafer (Ross, 2004). It \nprovides a mathematical framework to treat and represent uncertainty in the perception of vagueness, \nimprecision, partial truth, and lack of information (Tettamanzi and Tomassini, 2001).  \n \nPage 3 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 3 \nAs the basic theory of soft computing, fuzzy logic supplies mathematical power for the emulation of \nthe thought and perception processes (Sinha and Gupta, 2000). Fuzzy systems are very useful not only \nin situations involving highly complex systems but also in situations where an approximate solution is \nwarranted (Ross, 2004). To deal with qualitative, inexact, uncertain and complicated processes, the \nfuzzy logic system can be well-adopted since it exhibits a human-like thinking process (Du and Wolfe, \n1997).  \n \nFuzzy logic is a mathematical formal multi-valued logic concept which uses fuzzy set theory. Its \ngoal is to formalise the mechanisms of approximate reasoning. Fuzzy logic has widely been applied in \nvarious areas. Fuzzy control is one prominent example. In fuzzy control, data is characterised by \nlinguistic variables and expert knowledge (IF-Then-rules) using these variables is mapped into rule \nbases. In fuzzy control these bases can be used for logical inferences for controlling purposes (Petry \nand Zhao, 2009). One of the reasons for the success of fuzzy logic is that the linguistic variables, values \nand rules enable the engineer to translate human knowledge into computer evaluable representations \nseamlessly (Tettamanzi and Tomassini, 2001). Fuzzy rule bases \u2013 if sufficiently small \u2013 can be \ninterpreted by an engineer. This is different to Neural Networks (see next section), which are \nessentially black boxes. The treatment of data from a linguistic viewpoint is a major consideration in \nfuzzy set theory.  \n \nFuzzy logic is one of the techniques of soft-computing which can deal with impreciseness of input \ndata and domain knowledge and giving quick, simple and often sufficiently good approximations of the \ndesired solutions. Fuzzy logic is different from probability theory because fuzzy logic is deterministic \nrather than probabilistic. Imprecision is modeled via fuzzy sets, linguistic variables, membership \nfunctions, inferences and defuzzification. These concepts are all handled in an entirely deterministic \nmanner. There exist various forms of formal fuzzy logic, fuzzy set theory and fuzzy control systems. \nFor example, uncertainty in the membership functions in fuzzy set theory, i.e. uncertainty about the \nactual value of a membership function, has been addressed by type-2 fuzzy sets (Zadeh, 2008).  Fuzzy \nlogic operators (such as fuzzy \u2017and\u2018, \u2017or\u2018, \u2017not\u2018 operators) and defuzzification (i.e. the transformation of \na fuzzy set into a crisp value), can be modeled in various ways and are still widely discussed. A \nprominent example how fast growing and complex the field of fuzzy-logic has become can be seen \nfrom the t-norm, which is a non-classics logic operator used for fuzzy conjunctions interpretation. \nPage 4 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 4 \nThere exists a plethora of t-norm fuzzy logics which are discussed e.g. by Esteva, Godo and Montagna \n(Esteva et al., 2001). \n \nFrom the area of data modelling, fuzzy sets have not only been extended to data summarisation by \ndeveloping more abstract concepts and fuzzy gradual rules, but also been applied to pattern \nrecognition, e.g. fuzzy clustering algorithms (Bosc et al., 2005). In addition, a fuzzy multi-criteria \ndecision making algorithm has been developed for the network reconfiguration problem. It has been \nimplemented in a proof-of-concept tool and applied to multi-criteria problems successfully (Bernardon \net al., 2009). \n2.2. Neural Network \nA neural network is a parallel distributed information processing structure consisting of a number of \nnonlinear processing units called neurons. The neuron operates as a mathematical processor performing \nspecific mathematical operations on its inputs to generate an output (Musilek and Gupta, 2000). It can \nbe trained to recognise patterns and to identify incomplete patterns by duplicating the human-brain \nprocesses of recognising information, burying noise literally and retrieving information correctly \n(Kartalopoulos, 1996). \n \nIn terms of modelling, remarkable progress has been made in the last few decades to improve \nartificial neural networks (ANN). Artificial neural networks are strongly interconnected systems of so \ncalled neurons which have simple behaviour, but when connected they can solve complex problems. \nChanges may be made further to enhance its performance (Kartalopoulos, 1996). \n \nNeural networks and fuzzy systems, usually regarded as elements of artificial intelligence, have their \nshortcomings. Some of these shortcomings may be overcome if fuzzy logic operations are incorporated \ninto neural networks and neural networks are classified into fuzzy systems (Kartalopoulos, 1996). In \nfact, several authors have already combined fuzzy logic with neural network as neural-fuzzy systems \n(Yager, 1994). It may be a new class of computing systems provided by the integration of all these \nevolving disciplines for the emulation of higher-order cognitive power (Sinha and Gupta, 2000). They \nhave been applied in various products in a number of fields. \nPage 5 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 5 \n2.3. Genetic Algorithms \nEvolutionary algorithms (EA) were invented to mimic some of the processes observed in natural \nevolution. Evolution occurs on chromosomes - organic devices for encoding the structure of living \nbeings. Processes of natural selection then drive those chromosomes that encode successful structures \nto reproduce more frequent than those that encode failed structures. In other word, the chromosomes \nwith the best evaluations tend to reproduce more often than those with bad evaluations. By using \nsimple encodings and reproduction mechanisms, the algorithms can then display complicated \nbehaviour and turn out to solve some extremely difficult problems (Davis, 1991). \n \nGenetic algorithms (GA) are a special subclass of a wider set of EA techniques. In the following \nthey are especially highlighted due to their common appearance. GA were named and introduced by \nJohn Holland in the mid-1960s. Then Lawrence Fogel began to work on evolutionary programming \nand Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel introduced the evolution strategy. In resolving difficult \nproblems where little is known, their pioneered work stimulated the development of a broad class of \noptimisation methods (Tettamanzi and Tomassini, 2001). Subsequently the genetic algorithms were \nstudied by De Jong and Goldberg. Others such as Davis, Eshelman, Forrest, Grefenstette, Koza, \nMitchell, Riolo, and Schaffer, to name only a few, GA had been most frequently applied to the domain \nof optimisation (Back et al., 1997).  \n \nBased on the principles of natural evolution, genetic algorithms are robust and adaptive methods to \nsolve search and optimisation problems (Silva et al., 2005). Because of the robustness of genetic \nalgorithms, a vast interest had been attracted among the researchers all over the world (Goldberg, \n1989). In addition, by simulating some features of biological evolution, genetic algorithms can solve \nproblems where traditional search and optimisation methods are less effective. Therefore, genetic \nalgorithms have been demonstrated to be promising techniques which have been applied to a broad \nrange of application areas (Sinha and Gupta, 2000). The ability to apply genetic algorithms to real-\nworld problems has improved significantly over the past decade (Davis, 1991). The applications will be \nintroduced further in later sections. \n \nPage 6 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 6 \n3. Supply Chain Management \nChristopher (2004) defined supply chain management as the management of upstream and \ndownstream relationships with suppliers and customers to deliver superior customer value at less cost \nto the supply chain as a whole. Harrison and Hoek (2005) described the supply chain management as a \nplan and control all of the processes that link partners in a supply chain together in order to meet end-\ncustomers\u2018 requirements. \n \nAs the sub-process of supply chain management, logistics deals with planning, handling, and control \nof the storage of goods between manufacturer and consumer (Silva et al., 2005). Rushton et al. (2000) \ndescribed another well-known definition of logistics as the strategic management of movement, \nstorage, and information relating to materials, parts, and finished products in supply chains, through the \nstages of procurement, work-in-progress and final distribution. \n \nAs demonstrated in Figure 1, the concept of supply chain refers to the idea of developing a logistics \npipeline approach for finished goods to transfer through the supply chain (Rushton et al., 2000). The \nsupply chain highlights the close partnership from upstream supplier, transport operator, manufacturer, \nto the downstream 3rd party distributor and retailer. Its objective is to produce and distribute the \ncommodity in the right quantity, to the right place, and at the right time to minimise overall cost while \nmaintaining customer satisfaction. \n \nFigure 1.

Methodology \nThe research methodology involves reviewing papers for soft computing techniques applied to the \nrelated processes in supply chain management.  \n4.1. Sources and search methods \nThe databases that had been searched in this study include ScienceDirect, Emerald, ProQuest, \nInspec, and Comrendex. The reviewed papers were sorted out from more than 40 journals such as \nEuropean Journal of Operational Research, International Journal of Production Economics, Computers \n& Industrial Engineering, Expert Systems with Applications, Computers & Operations Research, \nFuzzy Sets and Systems, Decision Support Systems, Applied Soft Computing and Applied \nMathematics and Computation. \n \nInitially, two groups of keywords were used to cross-search related papers in specific databases. The \nfirst group of key words includes soft computing, artificial intelligence, neural network, fuzzy logic, \nevolutionary computation, and genetic algorithm while the second group includes supply chain, \ntransportation, logistics, forecasting, and inventory. Given the specific interest in how soft computing \ntechniques have been applied to supply chain management, the empirical and diverse studies published \nfrom 1990 to 2008 were selected for further analysis. Additionally, the reference sections of these \npapers were reviewed to locate additional studies of interest.  \n \nAs a result, the final references consist of 163 papers published in referred journals. \n4.2. Scope \nThe concept of supply chain management has been analysed by many researchers from various \nperspectives. However, it is beyond the scope of this paper to address all problems in details. In an \nattempt to provide a more intensive review of existing papers in this area, this paper mainly focuses on \nmanagement-related issues. The studies with non-management-related subjects will not be discussed in \nthis paper, such as robotics and automation, traffic flow prediction, public transportation policy, traffic \ncongestion\/control, traffic flow and its pattern analysis.  \n \nThe soft computing techniques and their applications have been developed vastly in recent years. \nThe techniques introduced in section 2 are the major focus in this research. \nPage 8 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 8 \n4.3. Framework \nThe framework applied in this research is defined and developed by the Global Supply Chain Forum \n(GSCF) (Cooper et al., 1997; Lambert et al., 1998; Lambert et al., 2005) sponsored by the Council of \nLogistics Management (since 2005 it is called the Council of Supply Chain Management \nProfessionals). The following eight processes of supply chain management have been categorised by \nthe GSCF:  \n\uf06c Manufacturing flow management \n\uf06c Order fulfilment \n\uf06c Demand management \n\uf06c Supplier relationship management \n\uf06c Product development and commercialisation \n\uf06c Returns management \n\uf06c Customer service management \n\uf06c Customer relationship management \n \n \nThe sub-processes of the GSCF framework are illustrated in Appendix 1. All reviewed papers are \nclassified into the categories introduced above.  \n \nReview articles on similar subjects have been published previously (Dougherty, 1995 & 1997). \nHowever, both papers mainly concentrated on transportation issues instead of the whole supply chain \ndomain.  \n \n5. The target subject processes \nTo refer to the eight processes of supply chain management categorised by the GSCF, the review of \nexisting papers is classified into the following sections. \nPage 9 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 9 \n5.1. Manufacturing flow management \nThe challenge to improve manufacturing performance has drawn the attention of researchers to \nemploy diverse soft computing techniques. This becomes evident from the over 60 papers in \nmanufacturing field which are included in this review.  \n \nAs shown in Figure 2, the initial paper with respect to application of soft computing in \nmanufacturing flow management was accepted in 1990. There were only a few works in this area \nbefore 2001. Nevertheless, it demonstrates a steady rise in the number of papers since 2003 and reaches \na peak in 2008. The evidence seems to be strong that more studies can be anticipated in the near future. \n \nFigure 2.

Particularly, there \nare 39 pieces of work focusing on materials planning, which make up 62.9% of all papers within the \nmanufacturing flow management field.  \nPage 10 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 10 \nFigure 3.

Then \nFuzzy logic and neural network were applied to industry and had been discussed by Du and Wolfe \n(1997). A fuzzy model was developed by Li et al. (2002) to address single-period inventory problem. \n \nRecently the typical inventory problems such as the order-quantity and reorder-point problem or the \ntwo storage inventory problem, have been solved by the development of multi-objective inventory \nmodel (Maiti and Maiti, 2006, 2007; Maiti, et al., 2006a, 2006b; Maiti, 2008; Dey, et al., 2008). The \neconomic lot-size scheduling problems were solved by a GA-based heuristic approach as well (Chang \net al., 2006a, Pourakbar et al., 2007). There were also a few studies concentrated on fuzzy order and \nproduction quantity with or without backorder problems (Yao and Lee, 1996; Lee and Yao, 1998, \n1999; Chang et al., 1998; Samanta and Al-Araimi, 2001; Mondal and Maiti, 2003; Yao et al., 2000; \nWang et al., 2007), \n \nAn early research of multi-criteria inventory classification was presented by Guvenir and Erel \n(1998). Later the multi-item inventory model was formulated to solve the multi-buyer joint \nreplenishment problem (Chan et al., 2003), the cost-saving problem for deteriorating items (Roy et al., \n2008), and the supplier selection problem (Rezaei and Davoodi, 2008). Kochel and Nielander (2005) \nshowed that simulation-based optimisation can be applied to multi-location inventory systems \nsuccessfully. Chang et al. (2008a) derived a GA-based model for the joint optimisation for the multi-\nbuyer and single-supplier problem. A fuzzy decision making model was developed to analyse the trade-\nPage 11 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 11 \noff effect between customer service level and inventory cost (Wang and Shu, 2005) and to solve \ninventory problems with fuzzy random variables (Xu and Liu, 2008). Based on an enhanced fuzzy \nneural network, Li and Kuo (2008) developed a decision support system to manage automobile spares \ninventory. Furthermore, Wu and Hsu (2008) proposed a GA-neural network approach to reduce spare \nparts logistics costs. \n \nOther inventory-related issues approached by researchers include vendor managed inventory \nproblems (Nachiappan and Jawahar, 2007; Chi et al., 2007), ABC classification of stock keeping units \n(Partovi and Anandarajan, 2002), optimisation of transportation cost as well as inventory cost \n(Yokoyama, 2002), shelf space allocation problems (Hwang et al., 2005), determination of base-stock \nlevels in a serial supply chain (Daniel and Rajendran, 2006). \n \nSupply chain planning \nSupply chain planning is focused on synchronising and optimising multiple activities involved in the \nenterprise from procurement of raw materials to the delivery of finished products to end customers \n(Roghanian et al., 2007). \n \nGenetic algorithms and artificial neural networks have been applied to derive optimal solutions for \ncollaborative supply chain planning (Chiu and Lin, 2004; Smirnov et al., 2004; Berning et al., 2004; \nHan and Damrongwongsiri, 2005). Moon et al. (2002; 2008) integrated process planning and \nscheduling model for resource allocation in multi-plant supply chain and Huin et al. (2003) presented a \nknowledge-based model for resource planning. Subsequently Huang et al. (2005) designed a supply \nchain model to integrate production and supply sourcing decisions. Also, Roghanian et al. (2007) \napplied fuzzy programming technique to solve multi-objective programming problem in supply chain \nplanning. \n \nProduction planning \nGenetic algorithms have been applied to solve production planning problems. The general \ncapacitated lot-sizing problem was studied by Xie and Dong (2002) initially. Ossipov (2005) then \nproposed a heuristic algorithm to optimise the sequence of customer orders in production line. \nMoreover, Kampf and Kochel (2006) focused on simulation-based sequencing and lot size optimisation \nPage 12 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 12 \nwhile Bjork and Carlsson (2007) analysed the effect of flexible lead times by developing a combined \nproduction and inventory model. In addition, lot scheduling (Chatfield, 2007) and batch manufacturing \nproblems (Li et al., 2007) were addressed.  \n \nOther issues \nOther issues that have been addressed in the area of manufacturing flow management include \nimprovement of procurement decision quality (Lau et al., 2005), load planning for a maritime container \nship (Imai et al., 2006), resource management for allocation of containers (Lau et al., 2004), internet-\nenabled global manufacturing management (Ulieru et al., 2002), truckload scheduling in an automatic \nstorage and retrieval warehouse (Oliveira, 2007), forward-backward analysis of dynamic supply chain \nenabled by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) (Kim et al., 2008), maximum warehouse space \nrequirement (Yao and Chu, 2008), and evaluation of ERP performance (Chang et al., 2008b) \n5.2. Order fulfilment \nOrder fulfilment is one of the key measures to reflect customer service performance. A \u2015perfect \norder\u2016 implies the completion of an order that entirely satisfies customer requirements. The key \ncomponents to grade actual order fulfilment are whether orders were delivered on time, in full, damage \nfree, with accurate and complete documentation (Rushton et al., 2000). How to fulfil these \nrequirements has become a major challenge of supply chain management. \n \nWithin the growing papers in supply chain domain, genetic algorithms have been applied to some \nchallenging tasks successfully, such as logistics network design, vehicle routing, and vehicle \nscheduling problems. In addition to that, there are other interesting works that develop genetic \nalgorithm approaches for customer allocation and shipping alternatives selection. \n \nAs illustrated in Figure 4, the number of papers regarding order fulfilment increased slowly, with \nsome fluctuations, between 1995 and 2003. However, a dramatic growth can be observed from 2004 to \n2008.  \n \nPage 13 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 13 \nFigure 4.

Other researchers concentrated on truckload assignment \n(Caputo et al., 2006), container shipping and repositioning (Shintani et al., 2007), concrete distribution \n(Naso et al., 2007), and third party logistics (3PLs) services integration (Ko et al., 2006; Ko and Evans, \n2007). The promising results from these applications indicate that evolutionary algorithms are suitable \nto work in a complicated and uncertain environment. \n \nTeodorovic (1999) proved that fuzzy logic could be a very promising mathematical approach to \nsolve complex traffic and transportation problems. Sheu (2004; 2006; 2008) firstly presented a hybrid \nfuzzy-based methodology to identify global logistics strategies then achieved a remarkable cost saving \nand customer service enhancement by allocating logistics resources dynamically.  \n \nVehicle routing \/ assignment \nDynamic vehicle routing and scheduling problems have drawn logistics managers and researchers\u2018 \nattention since 1990. It could be a key parameter for companies to develop competitive advantages in \norder to differentiate themselves from other competitors.  \n \nIn order to pick up and deliver within specific time window, Slater (2002) used expert system and \nartificial intelligence to predict e-commerce customer orders. Also, Pankratz (2005) justified that a GA-\nbased approach is able to find quality solution to meet the increasing demands on flexible and prompt \ntransportation services. \n  \nIn addition, Arslan and Khisty (2005; 2006) proved that fuzzy logic could be a promising approach \nto model driver\u2018s psychology and behaviour in route choice. Ganesh and Narendran (2007) produced \nan encouraging result on vehicle routing problem with pick-up and delivery sequence constraints while \nHo et al. (2008) proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve similar problem with multiple depots. \nFurthermore, Hu and Sheu (2003) explored the potential advantage of fuzzy clustering techniques in \nclassifying pre-trip customers by their demand attributes for further vehicle dispatching and routing \nPage 15 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 15 \noperations. Lin et al. (2008) proved that the proposed coordinated distribution mechanism is feasible to \nsolve distribution scheduling problems.   \n \nTorabi et al. (2006) found that a hybrid genetic algorithm is more promising in minimising \ntransportation cost in a simple supply chain. A survey of different heuristic shortest path algorithms for \ndemand-responsive transportation applications was presented by Fu et al. (2006).  \n \nIn terms of vehicle assignment, Vukadinovic et al. (1999) concluded that neural networks can refine \nthe fuzzy system to achieve better performance. In addition, Potvin et al. (1995) reported an \nexperimental result with data provided by a courier service company and proved that the neural \nnetwork outperform the linear programming model in vehicle dispatching. \n \nOther issues \nTo ensure an effective logistics decision-making process, Toivonen et al. (2006) analysed both \nqualitative and quantitative information from customers. Schneeweiss (2003) indicated possible \nsynergies between various sciences, such as applied mathematics and artificial intelligence, to solve \ndistributed decision making problems. Additionally, Zhou et al. (2002; 2003) found an optimal \nsolution, by considering total transit time and shipping cost simultaneously, to allocate customers to \navailable warehouses or distribution centres. Then Yang et al. (2007) developed a GA-based model to \nselect distribution centre location while total relevant cost is minimised. \n \nWith respect to measurement of supply chain performance, Chan et al. (2003) provided a simple \nmathematical model to calculate performance index. Lin et al. (2006) developed a fuzzy agility index \nto identify supply chain weaknesses and to devise further improvement plan. Subsequently, Jain et al. \n(2008) proposed a practical method for decision makers to evaluate agility in supply chains. \n \nDullaert et al. (2005) suggested an evolutionary algorithm to determine the optimal combination of \nshipping alternatives to minimise total logistics costs. Celik (2004) concluded that artificial neural \nnetworks are a very promising tool to predict the short-term inter-regional freight distribution. \n \nInterestingly the majority of these papers address mainly the ground transportation issues. Only a \nfew studies focus on maritime and aviation industries. This may be due to confidentiality reasons \n(Dougherty, 1995; 1997). \nPage 16 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 16 \n5.3. Demand management  \nDemand management plays a critical role within supply chain management. A reliable demand \nforecast can improve the quality of organisational strategy (Kuo, 2001). The domain of demand \nmanagement has been a major interest in soft computing since 1990s. Subsequently, considerable \nresearch has been performed on the subject of sales and demand forecasting. \n \nAs shown in Figure 6, the applications in demand management fluctuated before 2004, yet an \nobvious growth has started since 2005. On this basis it may infer the possibility of more work to be \npublished in this field in 2009 and after. \n \nFigure 6.

Manufacturing firms forecast future demand to prepare \nnecessary manpower and raw materials for production. Service companies forecast customer arrival \npatterns to maintain appropriate staffing to serve customer demands. Therefore, forecasting is one of \nthe major strategic activities in organisational decision-making processes for demand management.  \n \nIn fact, there is no perfect solution available to solve these problems due to the uncertainty and \ndifficulty to predict market demand. However, a reliable sales forecasting can enhance the overall \nperformance of an organisation effectively. On the contrary, the inaccuracy of forecasting typically \nresults in considerable disturbance in production planning. \n \nArtificial neural networks have been recognised as a valuable tool for forecasting. The major \nadvantages to employ artificial neural networks in forecasting include its self-adaptive capability to \nlearn from experience as well as to generalise results from sample data with noise. In addition, to \ncompare with conventional statistical methods, artificial neural networks can model continuous \nfunctions to any desired accuracy (Sprecher, 1965). Furthermore, as opposed to the traditional linear \nand nonlinear time series models, artificial neural networks are nonlinear data-driven approaches with \nmore flexibility and effectiveness in modelling for forecasting (Zhang et al., 1998).  \n \nFor instance, the artificial neural network has been applied to sales forecasting since 1998 (Kuo and \nXue, 1998a, 1998b, 1999; Kuo, 2001; Kuo et al., 2002). Similar approach had been used to sales \nforecasting in other industries as well, such as printed circuit board industry (Chang et al., 2005; 2006b; \n2007; 2008c; Chang and Wang, 2006), textile and apparel industry (Frank et al., 2003; Thomassey et \nal., 2005a, 2005b; Thomassey and Happiette, 2007), aggregate retail industry (Alon et al., 2001; Chu \nand Zhang, 2003), food products (Doganis et al., 2006), and glass products (Jeong et al., 2002). \n \nBesides, Wall et al. (1992) presented a prototype supply planning system to enhance short-term \ndemand forecast. Ansuj et al. (1996) and Luxhoj et al. (1996) presented a neural-network-based model \nto achieve more accurate sales forecasting results. In addition, Kimbrough et al. (2002) and Strozzi et \nal. (2007) analysed the famous beer game for order policy optimisation. Liang and Huang (2006) \ndeveloped a multi-agent system for agents in supply chain to share information and minimise total cost. \nPage 18 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 18 \nBullwhip effect \nThe bullwhip effect is one of the most popular research problems in supply chain management. It \ndescribes the distortion on demand forecasting throughout supply chain partners. Soft computing \ntechniques proved to be effective to reduce bullwhip effect in supply chains (Carbonneau et al., 2008; \nZarandi et al., 2008; Balan et al., 2009). \n \nOther issues \nIn addition to the above work, Marx-Gomez et al. (2002) employed neural-fuzzy approach to \nforecast returns of scrapped products. Aburto and Weber (2007) improved the forecasting accuracy of a \nreplenishment system proposed to a supermarket.  Lee and Ou-Yang (2009) developed a neural-\nnetwork-based model to forecast supplier\u2018s bid price in order to shorten the lead time in supplier \nselection. \n5.4. Supplier relationship management \nSeveral papers used fuzzy logic approach to monitor and measure suppliers\u2018 performance based on \ndifferent criteria (Gunasekaran et al., 2006; Chan and Kumar, 2007). For example, Lau et al. (2002) \nanalysed suppliers\u2018 product quality and delivery time while Shore and Venkatachalam (2003) focused \non the information sharing capability of potential partners. Deshpande et al. (2004) achieved an \noutstanding performance in assigning tasks to suppliers.  \n \nFurthermore, decision support models were proposed to enable a more effective selection of \nsuppliers (Moghadam et al., 2008), vendors (Wang et al., 2008), and 3PL service providers (Isiklar et \nal., 2007; Efendigil et al., 2008; Buyukozkan et al., 2008). Choy et al. (2002; 2003) used artificial \nneural network to design an intelligent supplier relationship management system in order to benchmark \nsuppliers\u2018 performance and shorten the cycle time of outsourcing. Chiadamrong and Prasertwattana \n(2006) proposed a genetic algorithm approach for optimisation of incentive scheme to manage \nperformance of supply chain partners to ensure the long-term strategic relationships. \n5.5. Product development and commercialisation \nThe soft computing techniques that have been applied to the sub-processes of product development \ninclude product quality enhancement and cost reduction (Tong and Liang, 2005), the relationship \nPage 19 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 19 \nbetween the shelf space assigned to various brands and the market share (Suarez, 2005), the optimal \nvariable selections of R&D and quality design (Tsai, 2006), and evaluation of supply chain \nperformance for new product (Wang and Shu, 2007). \n5.6. Returns management \nMin et al. (2006a, 2006b) proposed a GA-based approach to solve reverse logistics problem of \nmanaging returned products. Furthermore, Liechens and Vandaele (2007) developed an optimal \nsolution to solve the reverse logistics network design problem while Min and Ko (2008) addressed the \nsimilar problem from 3PL service providers\u2018 perspective. \n5.7. Customer service management \nBottani and Rizzi (2006) presented a fuzzy quality function deployment approach to address \ncustomer needs, improve logistics performance, and ensure customer satisfaction. \n5.8. Customer relationship management \nIt seems that there is a lack of papers addressing related issues in this area. \n6. Distribution of papers \nIn this section the distribution and growing trend of all reviewed papers, as well as the employment \nof soft computing techniques, are analysed and demonstrated according to various criteria. \n6.1. Distribution of papers in subject processes \nAs illustrated in Table 1, numerous research papers have contributed to 7 broad categories of supply \nchain management. The manufacturing flow management is the most popular area targeted by soft \ncomputing applications. The research papers about order fulfilment are slightly more common than the \npapers regarding demand management. It is clear therefore that papers for those three major subject \nprocesses in supply chain management are considerably more than those in other subject processes. \n \nPage 20 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 20 \nTable 1: Annual distribution of number of papers in respective subject processes \n \nManufacturing flow \nmanagement\nOrder                \nfulfillment\nDemand            \nmanagement\nSupplier \nrelationship \nmanagement\nProduct \ndevelopment & \ncommercialisation\nReturns      \nmanagement\nCustomer service \nmanagement\nTotal\n1990 1 1\n1991 1 1\n1992 1 1\n1993 0\n1994 0\n1995 2 2\n1996 2 2 4\n1997 2 1 3\n1998 3 2 5\n1999 2 2 1 5\n2000 1 1\n2001 1 2 3\n2002 6 3 4 2 15\n2003 3 4 2 2 11\n2004 4 2  1 7\n2005 7 7 3 2 19\n2006 7 10 4 2 1 2 1 27\n2007 10 8 4 2 1 1 26\n2008 12 8 3 4 0 1 28\n2009 2 2 4\nTotal 62 49 30 13 4 4 1 163  \n \n \nAdditionally, Figure 8 shows the proportion of papers focusing in major subject processes.

The growing trend of research in supply chain management \nAs demonstrated in Figure 9, there were only a few studies in the supply chain management area \nusing soft computing approaches in early 90\u2018s. Then the produced papers fluctuated slightly from 1995 \nto 2000. Over the next two years there was a dramatic increase of research. In spite of the decrease in \nthe number of papers from 15 in 2002 to 7 in 2004, the number rose significantly and reached a peak of \n28 in 2008. Looking at the general trend, the number of papers can be expected to increase in the \nfuture. \n \nFigure 9.

The employment of individual soft computing technique \nAs clearly demonstrated in Table 3, genetic algorithm has become the most frequent soft computing \ntechnique that has been applied to both manufacturing flow management and order fulfilment.

Discussion, conclusions and future research \nSome of the research papers involve more than one domain. Therefore it is difficult to classify \nindividual research to a single category. It is attempted to place each work in the closest representative \ncategory. However, this classification scheme aims to draw a general picture for the distribution of \nrelated papers. It does not impact the associated findings derived and the uncovered opportunity for \nfuture research. \n \nPage 24 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 24 \nBoth genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic approach are the most popular techniques adopted to solve \nsupply chain management problems, particularly in the manufacturing management and order \nfulfilment issues. Neural networks are broadly used to improve sales forecasting performance.  \n \nThe numerous and complex data sources are always needed to solve most of the problems in supply \nchain management. Soft computing tools seem promising and useful to analyse this data and to support \nmanager\u2018s decision making in a complex environment.  \n \nBy examining the number of papers in manufacturing flow management, order fulfilment and \ndemand management, the evidence seems to be strong that the issues in supply chain management have \nattracted a growing attention. It could be identified that there has been a significant upward trend of \napplying soft computing techniques to solve diverse supply chain management problems since 2002. \nThe reasons may not only be that more researches have been involved in traditional supply chain \ndomain, but also far more studies have been developed in new areas such as supplier relationship \nmanagement and product development and commercialisation since 2002. In addition, the emergence \nof user-friendly tools (e.g. Matlab) enables easier application of soft computing techniques, even by \nnon-specialist users. \n \nAn interesting observation is that two or more soft computing techniques were combined or varied to \nenrich the flexibility of problem solving. According to Table 3, the number of soft computing \ntechniques used is more than the number of papers. It indicates that an integrated solution which \ncombines multiple techniques is developed to pursue superior results. Therefore, there may be a great \npotential for further research either to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing practice or to \ncreate a new paradigm by integrating more practical algorithms. \n \nAnother suggestion for further research is how to fulfil more practical e-commerce business models \nby developing a dynamic demand-responsive technology which integrates real time electronic orders \nand en-route fleet management algorithms. To make or buy is always a trade-off consideration. 3PLs \nservice providers might be an ideal alternative solution to fulfil e-commerce business requirements. \nWith sophisticated information systems and dedicated equipments, 3PLs can provide reliable services \nto fulfil customer orders, especially for both dynamic forward flows and reverse flows. Thus it could be \nPage 25 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 25 \nan interesting research to make the most of 3PLs\u2018 value-added service to develop an integrated and \nflexible supply chain strategy. \n \nThis paper reviews the existing research papers in supply chain management, analyses their \ndistribution in respective subject processes, and provides suggestions for future research. While some \nof the main problems in supply chain management have been addressed by soft computing techniques, \nthere are still some areas of possible application which have not yet been well explored. This is \nparticularly true in the field of customer service management. The qualitative issues dominate customer \nservice management research. The qualitative nature of this domain also implies that it is difficult to \nframe problems in this area in a way that soft computing techniques can be readily applied. This may \nhave resulted in the limited number of studies in this area. It is therefore expected that this paper can \nstimulate more research in the field of supply chain management. \n \nPage 26 of 44\nAc\nce\npte\nd M\nan\nus\ncri\npt\n 26 \n8.
