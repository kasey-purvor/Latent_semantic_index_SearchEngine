Introduction   \n \nThermal Barrier Coatings are used to limit the heat transfer through a coating and to protect vital \nengine components from oxidation and hot corrosion.  A TBC system generally consists of three \nlayers and outer YSZ ceramic layer typically 125-200\u00b5m thick which is applied to a thin alumina \nlayer, the TGO, (initially this is in the order of 1\u00b5m thick) which forms on the bond coat.  The bond \ncoat is typically either a Pt-aluminide or and MCrAly layer. \n \nOne of the primary causes of failure of TBCs has been attributed to oxidation of the bond coat and \ngrowth of the Thermally Grown Oxide (TGO) [1].  Erosion has been named as the second most \ncommon failure mode, caused by the ingestion of particles, which leads to thinning of the TBC, \nreducing insulation and increasing the TGO growth rate [1].   \n \nIncreasing turbine inlet temperature has seen a rapid increase in corrosion problems caused by molten \ndeposits, otherwise known as calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate (CMAS) attack.  The porous \nstructure of EB PVD TBCs makes it susceptible to this type of attack, with the CMAS infiltrating the \npores and column boundaries resulting in both chemical and micro structural degradation of the \ncoating [2].  As there is a large coefficient of thermal expansion mismatch between the CMAS and the \nTBC, the added stain energy stored in the CMAS can lead to delamination and spalling between the \nTBC and bond coat [3].   \n \nIn 1992, Kim et al identified problems associated with the deposition of volcanic materials onto the \nhot sections of gas turbines [4].  Although this work did not involve components with TBCs, it did \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 2 \nserve to identify degradation due to blockage and cooling of molten deposits leading to further studies \nin this area.  By injecting known amounts of volcanic ash into the hot sections, it was identified that \nthe composition melted between 1090 and 1150\u00b0C, whereby the deposit became molten and adhered \nto surfaces.  Further research extended to more modern engines showed that TBC degradation \noccurred when engines ingested particles and other debris in sandy middle eastern environments, \nwhich also became molten and adhered to the surface of TBC coated components, but only when \ntemperatures exceeded 1150\u00b0C [5]. It was suggested that these molten deposits led to an increase in \ncoating stress due to the thermal expansion mismatch, causing spallation of the TBC.  Penetration of \nCMAS into pores is said to result in the loss of strain tolerance, leading to progressive exfoliation of \nthe coating on thermal cycles.   \n \nScott et al specifically investigated TBC performance on jet engines, which were used in the Middle \nEast, where these molten deposits were first identified as CMAS [6].  A common observation across \nall literature was that compositions of mineral intake were similar and all contained CaO, MgO, Al2O3 \nand SiO2.  This means that the correct components for CMAS are present in generic \u2018dirt\u2019 and that \nonly the ratios of these components differ.  When these constituents come together in the correct \ncomposition range then it forms the low melting point eutectic Calcium-magnesium-alumino-silicate \n(CMAS).  Depending on the composition of CMAS the melting point is usually approximately \n1240\u00b0C, much lower than the melting point of the constituents which by themselves would not cause a \nproblem.    \n \nIt was observed that very fine particles, with a diameter less than 10 microns can pass through the \nparticle separators and enter the combustor systems.  Usually, these particles do not possess sufficient \nkinetic energy to cause impact damage to the TBC, however they are aerodynamically captured within \nthe combustor gases (due to the leading edge and pressure surface of the aerofoil) and deposit onto the \nsurface [3]. \n \nWork by Borom, who investigated the spallation of Air Plasma Sprayed TBCs [5] showed that \nspallation was linked to the infiltration of molten deposits.  An important observation was that, from \nall available oxides in external environments, only CaO, MgO, Al2O3 and SiO2 made up the molten \nphase that penetrated into the TBC microstructure.  Most elements in the earths crust and soil occur in \nminerals, with oxygen, silicon, aluminium, iron, magnesium and calcium being the most common \nchemical elements [7], giving the scope for CMAS formation in a wide range of locations.  It is due to \nthe abundance of these elements in nature that leads to the easy deposition of the constituents of \nCMAS into engines, leading to significant corrosion problems.  Many of these materials are \ntransported into the soils and atmosphere in volcanic plumes [8].   \n \nDolomite, which is a calcium magnesium carbonate, has been identified as the most common \ncomponent found in the gas path in Saudi Arabia, and was associated with the degradation of engine \nperformance.  Dolomite would only need to combine in small amount with an aluminosilicate, which \nare also abundant within the same regions, to readily form CMAS within a gas turbine.  Many of these \nminerals named above have been identified in the locations where CMAS attack presents a large \nproblem to aircraft.  Any combination of the above minerals when present and in the correct \ncomposition will combine leading to significant corrosion problems.   \n \nCMAS is said to attack as a \u2018moving front\u2019, first by becoming molten and infiltrating into the TBC \npores.  When the CMAS cools, it freezes, locking together columns tips and the coating loses it ability \nto accommodate strains due to the thermal expansion mismatch with the super alloy base metal.  It \nfollows that the coating will suffer delamination cracking leading to the progressive exfoliation of \ndiscrete layers or spallation of the TBC coating, leading to the loss of thermal efficiency and \ndegradation of the base metal component.  Simultaneously, the coating has been reported to undergo \nsevere chemical attack from the CMAS [9].   \n \nResearch by Stott et al was one of the first studies to show that TBC coatings were degraded readily \nby the molten sands and molten glass debris [6].  It was claimed that the zirconia and yttria were \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 3 \nabsorbed from the ceramic during attack that happened preferentially at grain boundaries.  It was noted \nthat when the solubility limit of the Zirconia was exceeded that the phase was reprociprated as a \nmonoclinic fine grain structure depleted in yttria.  This has also been reported in other studies; Kramer \nin particular has studied the effects of CMAS attack in great depth [9-12] and found that CMAS \nrapidly penetrates the open structure of an EB PVD TBC upon melting, which leads to changes in \nchemistry and microstructure.  The original YSZ is said to dissolve in CMAS and re-precipitate with a \ndifferent morphology and composition.  The extent of penetration is controlled by the interaction \nbetween the thermal gradient through the TBC with the fluidity of the melt.  They also observed that \nthe CMAS composition did not melt, penetrate or adhere to the substrate at temperatures below \n1230\u00b0C, partial melting was observed at 1235\u00b0C which was completed by 1240\u00b0C. \n \nCMAS was observed to penetrate right down to the substrate, noticeably attacking the alumina TGO, \nwhich promoted detachment of the TBC.  The failure mechanism was identified as the infiltration of \nCMAS between the intercolumnar pores, resulting in a monolith structure when cool with complete \nloss of the strain tolerance.  Examination of the samples showed that the bulk of the columns remained \nintact but were impregnated with CMAS, whereas the column tips, (columns \/ bulk CMAS interface) \nand substrate \/ TBC interface showed significant degradation, as shown in Figure 1.  \n \nKramer observed that the column tips completely lost their identity, and were replaced with a series of \nglobular particles that were embedded with CMAS.  The effect of temperature of this \u2018upper\u2019 reaction \nzone was that the area of degradation increased with increasing temperature significantly.  At 1240\u00b0C, \nthe area of globular particles extended just 14\u0001m into the coating, but by 1400\u00b0C this had extended to \napproximately 42\u0001m.  However, with that said, it was noted that the general appearance of the \ndegraded area was not related to temperature, and the \u2018number\u2019 of globular particles did not increase \nwith increased temperature.   \n \nAll open capillaries in any TBC structure are vulnerable to CMAS attack due to its excellent wetting \nproperties, particularly on YSZ, and it is able to spread rapidly over the surface and penetrate the \nstructure.  Infiltration rate is affected by the availability of the melt; hence melt kinetics [12], as well \nas capillary-driven flow into a porous medium [9]. \n \nFrom calculations, Kramer estimated that the infiltration of a 200\u0001m EB-PVD TBC coating took less \nthan one minute, even at the lowest recorded melting temperature of 1240\u00b0C [9].  It is therefore \nexpected that the CMAS is able to infiltrate a coating from tips to the substrate even before the highest \ntemperature has been reached, explaining why the attack of the substrate \/ TBC interface occurs at \ntemperatures just above melting temperatures.   \n \nThe maximum operating temperature of TBCs is potentially being limited by CMAS infiltration.  \nWhen this deposit melts, it is drawn by a capillary action into all open pores due to the morphology \nand structure of the TBC.  When the temperature is reduced, the CMAS cools and solidifies, resulting \nin the infiltrated area developing a high modulus [11].  With the whole penetrated region essentially \nbeing a solid structure, there is a complete loss of strain tolerance as well as a decrease in thermal \nconductivity.  It is when the CMAS infiltrated region is subject to rapid cooling that delamination \nbecomes the dominant form of failure.  This loss of strain tolerance is a significant problem with TBCs \nas it makes them susceptible to thermomechanical failure brought about by the thermal cycling \nexperienced by TBCs during their normal operations.   \n \nBoth EB-PVD and APS TBCs are susceptible to loss of strain tolerance, due to the porous structures, \nwhich are designed specifically to be effective in reducing thermal conductivity as well as \naccommodating the thermal expansion mismatch between the TBC and substrate.  Once the CMAS \ncools sufficiently the TBC becomes a fully dense domain, locking together the tips of the columns and \nsplats, the thermal expansion mismatch causes crack initiation and propagation ultimately leading to \nthe complete loss of the TBC. \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 4 \nWith delamination and spalling identified as the most prominent form of failure attributed to CMAS, \nthere is a wide range of literature on this aspect when compared to the thermochemical mechanism.  \nMercer, in 2004, investigated delamination mechanisms for EB-PVD TBCs that were subject to \nCMAS infiltration, which he associated with \u2018cold shock\u2019 on engine shut down [11].  He identified \nthat there were potentially three important mechanisms, in which he based upon observation of the \nsub-surface delamination within infiltrated regions.  Using these observations he made the following \nassumptions: \u201ca) The sub-surface delamination always infiltrates at surface-connected vertical \nseparation, b) They are fully infiltrated with CMAS, and c) they are strictly mode I\u201d [11].     \n \nFigure 2 is an example of delaminations that occur on both TBCs on aerofoils and shrouds, and is in \nagreement with statements made by Mercer [11] and Chen [13], that delaminations occur in mode I \nand always extend from surface cracks.   \n \nFinally, recommendations concerning the critical penetration depth that causes cold shock \ndelaminations showed that this thickness is dependant upon heat transfer coefficient.  This implies that \nthere is a heat transfer coefficient below which delamination can be avoided.  A rapid shock model \ncreated using shock analysis predicted that the critical infiltration thickness is approximately 30\u0001m, \nalthough for less severe shocks this thickness would be larger.  Using this model Mercer has suggested \ntwo possible techniques for the prevention of this delamination mechanism, this includes maintaining \nthe temperature at a range that ensures the CMAS infiltration depth is kept below this critical \nthickness. This other method is to control the critical cooling rate during engine shut down.   \n \nIt was found from investigating components used in the field that the depth of penetration of the \nCMAS is location dependant.  The depth of penetration had a significant impact on the delamination, \nwith the deeply infiltrated regions exhibiting multiple sub-surface delaminations which originate from \na single channel crack.  The location of the delaminations were found to predominate at three levels, \nthose being, just above the bond coat, adjacent to the bottom of the CMAS infiltrated area and just \nbelow the top surface, with the most important of these being shown in figure 14.   \n \nDelaminations just below the top surface were found to be completely filled with CMAS, hence \nusually still firmly adhered.  Those adjacent to the bottom of the CMAS infiltrated area tended to link \ntogether, causing large sections to spall, in what was described as a \u201cslab of ejected material\u201d.    Those \njust above the bond coat were found to be the most detrimental to the durability of the coating as they \nwere usually extremely long.   \n \nThe CMAS composition with depth into the TBC varied, with shows that there are a series of melting \nand infiltration steps that are \u201cconsistent with the stochastic nature of the ingestion and deposition of \nsiliceous debris\u201d [14].  Using TEM Kramer ascertained that the CMAS structure itself changed at a \ndepth of 150\u0001m.  At the surface of the examined component the structure of the CMAS is amorphous, \nand as it penetrates deeper into the coating it became crystalline.  Large globular particles were \nidentified at 180\u0001m in depth and were identified as re-precipitated zirconia, which suggests that the \nCMAS crystallises after dissolution.  It probably should be noted that there was no mention of the \ntemperatures that the shrouds were subject to during this study, which makes comparison of this \nresearch to other studies rather difficult, as it is highly likely that the severity of any CMAS attack is \ndependant upon the temperature.  It is also likely that the temperature experienced by this component \nvaried greatly during operation, hence depending upon where the component was section was likely to \ngive a different solution.   \n \nIt is evident from the literature that CMAS attack of EB PVD TBCs is starting to become a lifing issue \nfor some turbine engines, and is being investigated, however, most of the research either uses engine \nrun components or samples which have large amounts of CMAS deposited onto the coating.  This \npaper is the first to investigate the minimum levels of CMAS deposition required to initiate CMAS \nattack.  Another issue which has not yet been resolved is when the CMAS is formed.  Does \natmospheric dust react in the combustor to form CMAS which then deposits onto the turbine blades?  \nOr do the various constituent powders deposit onto the turbine blades and then form CMAS if \/ when \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 5 \nthe surface temperature of the blade exceeds 1240\u00b0C.  One of the aims of this paper was to determine \nthe minimum level of CMAS required to initiate damage in the TBC.  The reason for trying to \ndetermine the minimum levels required for attack was to be able to produce samples, for erosion \ntesting, which were only partially infiltrated with CMAS and thus determine the effect of CMAS \nattack on the erosion of EB PVD TBC, in other words to determine the erosion-corrosion behaviour of \nEB PVD TBCs. \n \n2.  Test Method \n \nIn order to establish the minimum level of CMAS required to infiltrate and attack a TBC, small levels \nof CMAS and powders were sprayed (in a water suspension) onto EB PVD TBCs and then heat \ntreated at 1300\u00b0C for 4hrs to ensure that there was sufficient time for CMAS attack to occur.  To this \nend EB PVD TBC samples which had been deposited onto single crystal pure (99.99%) alumina were \ncoated with 0.0075g, 0.01g, 0.015g 0.02g and 0.03g of CMAS powder and heat treated. \n \nDue to the fact that all the heat treatments were conducted (in air) in a tube furnace under isothermal \nconditions 99.99% purity sapphire discs were used as the substrates for EB PVD TBC deposition.  \nOnly one composition of CMAS was used in this study, 48 SiO2 - 35CaO \u2013 10MgO \u2013 7Al2O3(mol%), \nalthough it was used in two different forms, as a chemically reacted CMAS and as the component \npowders referred to as  reacted CMAS and constituent powders in this paper. \n \nTo deposit the CMAS a spray gun method was adopted in order to ensure the most uniform and \naccurate coverage possible.  The spraying was carried out within a fume cupboard, which contained a \nheated plate, a clamp and the spray gun.  The spray gun was externally connected to a compressed air \nline, and held in the clamp to ensure it was always in the same position when spraying the sample.  \n \nAll heat treatment took place in a horizontal tubular Al2O3 furnace. This furnace is controlled \nelectronically and has a maximum operating temperature of 1500\u00b0C.  Samples were loaded onto Al2O3 \n\u2018boats\u2019, which were pushed into the working section of the furnace.   \n \nThe hot target was set to the temperature required, in most cases this was 1300\u00b0C with a ramp up time \nof 10\u00b0C\/min.  The dwell time was set in minutes to the length required before the furnace was set to \nramp down to 20\u00b0C, which was also set at 10\u00b0C\/min.  During all of these heat treatments the furnace \nwas never loaded or unloaded when the furnace was hot, and in all experiments the samples were \nremoved when the furnace temperature gauge read room temperature.  \n \n3. Results \n \n3.1 Initial CMAS Investigation \n \nThe first samples to be examined were those that were subject to large quantities of CMAS \n(120mg\/cm2) in order to establish if degradation occurred at the chosen CMAS composition and \nconditions.  On removal from the furnace, both types of CMAS samples appeared to have a glassy \ntexture on the surface.   \n \nCMAS1, the compressed and heat-treated \u2018reacted\u2019 CMAS shown in Figure 3(a), showed no damage \nto the TBC, and had a thick glassy coating of CMAS.  CMAS2, made solely from the constituent \npowders also had a thick CMAS coating, but the TBC had several large cracks, shown in Figure 3(b).    \n \nIn order to establish whether the level of attack on these two samples was the same, both samples were \nexamined using Raman Spectroscopy and ESEM. \n   \nThe samples were examined in cross section using Raman Spectroscopy, a standard 7YSZ coating \nwith a meta stable tetragonal (t\u2019) crystal structure has characteristic peaks at 250 R cm-1  and 625 R \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 6 \ncm-1.  The monoclinic (m) on the other hand has a series of peaks in the 175 R cm-1 range with smaller \npeaks at between 290 to 390 R cm-1.   \n \nFigure 4 shows the Raman Spectrum for samples CMAS1 and CMAS2 compared with the standard \n7YSZ.  This confirms that at high levels of CMAS deposition there is a shift from tetragonal to \nmonoclinic, although there was not a complete transformation.  It is also interesting to note that the \nconstituent powder (CMAS2) has shifted considerably more towards monoclinic than the reacted \nCMAS (CMAS1).   \n \nRaman spectroscopy revealed that the constituent powders appeared to have a more pronounced shift \ntowards monoclinic than reacted CMAS, which is the first indication that the different types may not \nbe having the same effect.  In order to show whether the two CMAS types were equivalent the \nsamples were examined using the Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope, to study any changes \nin morphology.  This equipment was also used to study the composition and look for changes to the \nTBC using elemental analysis (EDX), which could be used to explain why a difference in the Raman \nspectra was observed. \n \nThe results showed almost identical damage to the TBC structure with both CMAS types, see Figure \n6.  The damage occurred in terms of severe damage to the tips of the TBC columns, and at first glance \nboth appear to be full of holes.  Elemental analyses of the \u2018holes\u2019 (dark regions) showed that they have \nthe same composition as the bulk CMAS, with the addition of both yttria and zirconia and shows how \nCMAS has infiltrated and solidified within the columns.   \n \nElemental analysis confirmed that the tips of the columns are depleted in yttria when the CMAS \ndegraded samples were compared with the control, showing a drop of approximately one third, which \nis in agreement with previous research by Kramer [9]. \n \n3.2 Determination of Minimum Level Required for CMAS Attack \n \nThe ESEM was used to examine the cross sections of the samples subjected to CMAS attack \nconcentrating on the tips of the columns and the TBC substrate interface.  These were then compared \nto a reference sample shown in Figure 7.  The Micrographs in figures 7 to 9 are all of fracture sections. \n \nIn order to assess the damage from the CMAS, closer examination of the samples which had \nconstituent powder CMAS applied were examined, starting from the sample that had received the \nlowest amount, 0.0075g (1.8mg\/cm2). \n \nIt can be seen from these images that the columns and column tips remain intact, with very little \ndifference between the images in Figure 8 and the control shown in Figure 7.  From the lower \nmagnification image there appears to be evidence of very minimal CMAS attack, however the TBC \nstill appears to be fully adhered to the substrate from closer examination of the interface.  From these \nimages it can be assumed from the good adherence and very minimal damage to the intracolunmar \nstructure that 1.8mg\/cm2 is a safe level of CMAS attack.  \n \nFollowing this samples that had increasing amounts of CMAS (0.01g, 0.0125g, 0.02g and 0.03g) were \nexamined after heat treatment for 4hrs at 1300\u00b0C. \n \nIn the sample with 0.01g, CMAS degradation to the column tips was beginning to initiate, with the \ndamage only affecting column tips sporadically across the surface with a number of areas that \nremained completely unaffected.  This was common across the entire surface of the sample.  It could \nbe assumed that the sporadic degradation was a consequence of \u2018non-uniform\u2019 coverage of the CMAS \ndue to a low level being applied.  \n \nThe sample with 0.0125g (3mg\/cm2) of CMAS showed little change from the 0.01g sample.  Although \nstill sporadic, there was a more distributed attack across the sample surface.  There were very few \n(c) \n(a) \n(c) \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 7 \ncolumns that were completely unaffected by the CMAS, and the formation of globular particles was \nbecoming more apparent.  The main difference between this sample and the previous was the \nbeginning of the loss of the column tips; however this only occurred in the more severely damaged \ncolumns.   \n \nAs can be seen in the SEM micrographs in Figure 10, the formation of globular particles was more \nconsistent at this level, with nearly all columns showing evidence of CMAS attack.  Many of the \ncolumns were losing their identity at the tips and it is clear that this level would have a significantly \ndetrimental effect on the TBCs\u2019 performance.  At this level the CMAS has caused degradation to a \ndepth of approximately 30\u0001m, which increases to 50\u0001m in the more heavily affected areas.  Again, \nthis is a sign of non-uniform deposition, but it is clear that the CMAS attack is significant at this level.   \n \nThe TBC was also examined from the top, to provide information regarding the shape of the formation \nof globular particles, Figure 11 shows the top of sample P_0.02, after four hours at 1300\u00b0C.  As \ndeposited, the particles would be expected to be angular and if they melt completely then surface \ntension would make them take on the appearance of spherical or globular particles.  This is important, \nas the shape they produce shows if they start to wet the column tops. At temperatures just below the \nmelting point, surface diffusion can lead to facetted crystals forming with slightly rounded edges.  \nHence inspection of these particles shows whether there is any interaction with ZrO2 (Y2O3) and \nwhether they have melted. \n \nWhen shown next to the control in Figure 12 the image in Figure 11 shows sintering of the columns \nand loss of the column tips.  It also shows how the sintering has occurred in patches, and only affects \nareas of columns rather than being distributed uniformly across the surface.   \n \nAll samples were furnace cooled, i.e. cooled slowly into a near equilibrium structure of the reaction \nproducts.  The shapes and sizes of the globular particles were compared with the shape and size of the \nconstituent particles.  It was found that overall, the size of the globules were smaller than the \u2018as \ndeposited\u2019 particles in both types of CMAS used.  The shape of the deposited particles was angular, \nand due to them melting completely they become more spherical and globular due to surface tension.  \nThis contact appearance provides information on surface energy, and shows that the particles wet the \n7YSZ column tops, showing that there is an interaction between the CMAS and the TBC.  \nExamination of the interface showed that spallation was starting to occur, with significant damage.   \n \nBy 0.03g the spallation had become so severe that it was not possible to examine the sample using \nESEM as the coating had completely delaminated from the surface of the substrate flaking off in \nnumerous small pieces, showing that between 0.02g and 0.03g the effect of CMAS at the substrate \ninterface becomes significant and life limiting.  However, it can be assumed that by this level \nsignificant CMAS damage has occurred and 4.8mg\/cm2 (0.02g) can be defined as an unsafe level.   \n \n3.3  Erosion Testing \n \nCMAS has been shown to have excellent erosion properties as a glazing material, so it was important \nto measure the erosion properties of a sample that had been sufficiently degraded, yet did not have any \nexcess CMAS on the surface.  For this reason 4.8mg\/cm2 (0.2g) of CMAS was selected, as this level \nhad caused formation of globular particles to approximately 35\u0001m depth within the TBC in a uniform \nmanner (representative of a thermal gradient), yet no excess CMAS remained on the surface.  Despite \n30\u0001m being described as the critical depth required to cause delamination and spalling for a rapid \nshock model, for the purpose of this study it was felt more important to have a sample that had \nuniform degradation and the samples were not subjected to a thermal shock. \n \nIn order to carry out these tests, it was first important to ensure that the level of CMAS degradation \nobserved in the previous samples was also observed in the erosion samples.  Four samples were \ndeposited with 0.02g of CMAS and heat treated at 1300\u00b0C for four hours.  One of these samples was \nsectioned and examined using the ESEM, prior to the erosion testing.  Having confirmed that the \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 8 \ndegradation was consistent with what had previously been observed, two samples from the same batch \nwere then used for erosion testing and one standard TBC as a control for comparison.   \n \nErosion testing was carried out at room temperature at a rate of 0.54g of Al2O3 erodent per minute. \nThe alumina grit size used was 90-125\u00b5m and the test was carried out at an average particle velocity \nof 100m\/s. The samples were eroded for three minutes in thirty second intervals and were weighed \nafter each interval.  During run 5 sample P-0.02a spalled significantly and the testing was stopped for \nthis sample.   \n \nAs can be seen in Figure 13 both the CMAS degraded samples had a similar erosion rate which was \nsignificantly higher than the control sample. \n \nBoth CMAS samples have a significantly higher initial erosion rate than the control, which then \nreduces slightly when it settles into a steady state rate.  The control by comparison has a lower initial \nerosion rate, which then increases after the second thirty second exposure period, although remains \nconsistently lower than the CMAS degraded samples.   \nThe erosion rate was calculated from the gradients of the curves, and is shown in Figure 14, which \nshows both an initial erosion rate, which was calculated from the first point on the curve and a steady \nstate erosion rate calculated from the straight line section of the curve.   \n \nDepending on the impact conditions and the particle size a number of different erosion mechanisms \nhave been identified for the erosion of EB PVD TBCs by solid particle impact [15].  Under the \nconditions tested in this paper the near surface cracking mechanism was expected to be the \npredominant mode of material loss.  This was indeed found to be the case for both the control and the \nCMAS infiltrated samples.  However, as can be seen in Figure 15b, in the control sample the columns \nof the TBC are discreet and cracks do not propagate into neighbouring columns.  While in the samples \ninfiltrated with CMAS the columns are no longer discreet and, as indicated by the arrows, cracks \ninitiated in one column can propagate into other columns.  This results in a higher mass loss per \nimpact and thus a higher erosion rate.     \n \nAlso of interest is the fact that the initial erosion rate of the infiltrated samples was significantly higher \nthan the steady state erosion rate.  This has been attributed to the fact that the samples were infiltrated \nto a depth of around 30\u00b5m and that this layer was most likely totally removed in the first erosion run.  \nFurther investigations are required to determine precisely why the infiltration of CMAS has such a \nsignificant effect on the erosion rate of the coating. \n \n4. Conclusion \n \n \n\u2022 CMAS causes severe damage to the column morphology, due to a dissolution \u2013 re-\nprecipitation mechanism and sintering of columns.  This degradation then reduces the TBCs \ninsulating properties and reduces its strain tolerance.  \n\u2022 The minimum level at which CMAS degradation occurs uniformly over the column tips was \nfound to be 4.8mg\/cm2 after 4 hours at 1300\u00b0C, hence this can be defined as the minimum \nlevel at which the TBC would start to lose its ability to protect vital engine components.  \nAlthough this observation is specific for both the conditions of the tests and the composition \nof the CMAS used, this work has shown that minimum levels do exist although they may vary \nfor different conditions and CMAS compositions. \n\u2022 Raman spectroscopy confirms a change in crystal structure from tetragonal to monoclinic, due \nto depletion in yttria.   \n\u2022 CMAS degradation leads to a significant increase in the erosion rate of TBCs, even at the \nminimum level of 4.8mg\/cm2. \n \n \n \nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT \nPage 9 \n8.
