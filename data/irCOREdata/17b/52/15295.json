Numerous empirical studies demonstrate that the quality of this relationship is \npositively related to followers\u2019 attitudes and organisational outcomes. It has been proposed \nthat the quality of possible relationships between the leader and the led will be affected by the \nnumber of employees directly reporting to the leader, with empirical findings showing a \nslight negative relationship between span of control and LMX. Little is known, however, \nabout how span of control influences variability in the quality of leader-member-exchange \nwithin the context of work groups. Therefore, following a recognized assumption to strive for \nas many as possible leadership relations on a high LMX level, we examine how individual \nand group level (consensus in) LMX can be based on different dimensions of the LMX \nrelationship. We suggest how LMX consensus and a high LMX level can be established even \nin large spans of control. \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n3 \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Subordinate Consensus in \nLeader-Member Exchange \nIntroduction \nLeader-member exchange (LMX) refers to the relationship quality a leader shares with \nindividual members of his or her work group. From the outset of research in this area it has \nbeen shown that leaders differentiate their relationships and their behaviour toward \nsubordinates within their work groups (Graen and Cashman, 1975; Liden & Graen, 1980). \nThat is, in the course of their interactions, leaders develop qualitatively different relationships \nwith followers suggesting little consensus among those subordinates regarding LMX quality. \nSuch differentiation among followers by leaders is central to LMX theory (Liden, Sparrowe \n& Wayne, 1997).  The issue of differentiation is particularly relevant because many \nindividual studies and indeed meta-analyses (e.g., Gerstner & Day, 1997; Ilies, Nahrgang & \nMorgeson, 2007) confirm that leader-member exchange quality is positively related to \nfollowers\u2019 positive attitudes and organisational outcomes, implying that only high level \nexchanges would be preferable. \nInitially proposed as a dyadic-level theory to capture the leader-member relationship, \nLMX has been discussed and examined from multiple levels of analysis. Most frequently, an \nindividual level of analysis, where the quality of the exchange has been assessed from one \ndyad member\u2019s perspective, has been used (Schriesheim, Castro, Zhou & Yammarino, 2001). \nAt the dyad level, researchers have focused on and examined the essence of exchanges or \nreciprocity between dyad members, including discussions of multiple dimensions of LMX \n(e.g., Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Uhl-Bien & Maslyn, 2003) as well as agreement between \nleader and follower (Gerstner & Day, 1997). Further, LMX has been viewed as a relative \nphenomenon (individuals-within-groups level), where variability in the relationship quality \nwithin groups serves as the relevant approach to understanding the impact of different quality \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n4 \nrelationships (e.g., Cogliser & Schriesheim, 2000). Finally, more recent examinations (e.g., \nBoies & Howell, 2006; Cogliser, Schriesheim, Scandura, & Gardner, 2009; Liden, Erdogan, \nWayne & Sparrowe, 2006) have considered the importance of the group level, using \ndifferentiation itself as a key variable.  \nDespite the extant literature showing the great extent of differentiation by leaders, it is \noften suggested that leaders should strive for high quality exchange relationships across their \nentire work group (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995; Maslyn & Uhl-Bien, 2005). Consequently, a \nhigh absolute average of LMX ratings on the follower side (high level of LMX quality), \naccompanied by a low variability of ratings of followers reporting to the same leader (high \nconsensus) and a high level of shared perceptions (leaders and members rating their \nrelationship the same) about the LMX quality between leader and follower regarding the \nsame dyadic relationship (high agreement) should be a manager\u2019s goal, a combination called \nLMX excellence by Schyns and Day (in press). Ultimately, however, it has also been \nsuggested in the LMX literature (e.g., Dansereau, Graen & Haga, 1975; Liden et al., 1997) \nthat while managers should attempt such broad high quality relationship development, it is \nextremely difficult to accomplish, especially in large work groups.  \nFor example, Dansereau et al. (1975) argue that leaders possess limited resources of \ntime and energy, which automatically limits the number of possible high-quality relationships \nthey can develop and maintain. Similarly, there is support in the LMX literature for the \nproposition that increased span of control fosters greater differentiation (Green, Anderson & \nShivers 1996; Schriesheim, Castro & Yammarino, 2000; Schyns, Paul, Mohr & Blank, 2005). \nOther studies, however, have failed to support and even disagree with this assertion (Cogliser \n& Schriesheim, 2000; Kinicki & Vecchio, 1994), leaving the question more equivocal than \ncertain. As high LMX quality is shown to be a positive asset for organisations and because \ncurrent organization structuring tends to increase the span of control through downsizing, \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n5 \ndecentralization, and empowerment, it is worthwhile to look deeper into this contradicting \nresearch. \nThe organisational terminology \u201cspan of control\u201d describes the number of employees \nwho are formally and directly subordinated to a superior and are reporting to her\/him. \nThough thinking about the optimal span of control and the impact of span of control has been \na foundational issue in organization theory since the classical study of Graicunas appeared \n(1937), LMX research has not considered span of leadership beyond the core tenets of the \nexchange of limited resources to key individuals in the workgroup. In this paper, we define \nspan of control in a practical rather than theoretical fashion: a large span of control is defined \nas the number of followers led by a leader that make \u201cclose\u201d (high quality) relationships \ndifficult to pursue across all members. The actual number of followers that render a work \ngroup large may vary depending on, for example, the structure of a work group (e.g., team \nversus individual direct reports; task interdependence). \nThe aim of this paper is examine the impact of the manager\u2019s span of control on \nindividual and group level LMX (consensus) as a means of understanding the circumstances \nthat could affect LMX within work groups. Rather than centre on LMX as a composite of \nmultiple dimensions or currencies of exchange, we offer propositions that focus on the \ninfluence of span of control on different dimensions of LMX (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; \nLiden & Maslyn, 1998). One of our key assumptions is that increased leader distance \n(Antonakis & Atwater, 2002; Shamir, 1995) created by a large span of control influences \nLMX dimensions differently. We concentrate here on the individual level effect (quality of \nLMX relationship as seen by one follower) and the group level effect (consensus regarding \nLMX quality in a group of followers reporting to the same leader). With this baseline, we \ndiscuss a number of implications regarding consensus among group members in high quality \nLMX relationships. \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n6 \n \nDimensions of LMX \nDifferent types of currencies of exchange, discussed in depth in the multidimensional \napproach to LMX (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Liden & Maslyn, 1998), are central to our \nunderstanding of the LMX-span relationship. In early conceptualizations of LMX theory, the \nexchanges made between members were considered to be essentially work-related and consistent \nwith the traditional roles of manager and subordinate (Graen & Scandura, 1987; Graen & Uhl-\nBien, 1995). For example, followers might contribute a high level of effort toward the job while \nleaders might reciprocate by providing favourable task assignments. As research in LMX theory \nprogressed, however, various researchers (e.g., Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Liden et al., 1997) \nargued that LMX was not based solely on the job-related elements emphasized in earlier work \nbut may also include socially-related currencies. Specifically, Dienesch and Liden (1986) and \nLiden and Maslyn (1998) proposed multiple dimensions of LMX that included both material and \nnon-material currencies of exchange. These dimensions were labelled Contribution (e.g., \nperforming work beyond what is specified in the job description), Affect (e.g., friendship and \nliking), Loyalty (e.g., loyalty and mutual obligation), and Professional Respect (e.g., respect for \nprofessional capabilities). Other LMX research has produced measures of these constructs and \ndemonstrated validity of these dimensions (Liden & Maslyn, 1998; Schriesheim, Neider, \nScandura & Tepper, 1992).   \nThe multidimensional approach to LMX has received growing attention in the \nliterature and scholars have started utilizing the LMX-MDM (LMX multidimensional \nmeasure, Liden & Maslyn, 1998) to assess LMX in their research. Maslyn and Uhl-Bien \n(2001) provided an early glimpse into the value of a multidimensional approach in finding \nunique effects among the dimensions in an examination of effort toward relationship \ndevelopment. Use of the component dimensions of the LMX-MDM (contribution, affect, \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n7 \nloyalty, and professional respect) as either independent antecedents or outcomes, however, is \nstill limited with the vast majority of research using the LMX-MDM combining the \ndimensions to form a broader measure of LMX (see Ansari, Hung & Aafaqi, 2007; Schyns & \nPaul, 2005, for recent exceptions). \nInvestigating LMX in large spans of control opens up the question as to whether or \nnot these different currencies of exchange are manifested in different ways in larger work \ngroups. As prior research has concentrated on the relationship between span of control and a \ncomposite measure of LMX (Green et al., 1996; Schriesheim et al., 2000, Schyns et al., \n2005), we no virtually know nothing about the role of dimensions with regard to span of \ncontrol. However, because the different dimensions require different reinforcement, helping \nleaders to understand the role of dimensions in LMX relationships seems a fruitful way to \nsupport LMX relationships also in large spans of control.  \nIn the following, we will first set out our general theoretical background relating to \nthe role of dimensions of LMX in large spans of control and then derive how individual level \nLMX is shaped by those dimensions in large spans of control. Subsequently, we will transfer \nthese considerations to the group level.  \n \nIndividual Level: The influence of span of control on different LMX currencies of exchange \nWe propose that not all currencies of exchange are equal in the amount of effort needed \nby leaders to develop or maintain a high quality relationship. LMX relationships develop through \ntesting processes and the exchange of valued currencies of exchange (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995; \nLiden et al., 1997). Given a large span of control, managers have resource constraints that can \nlead to a differential exchange among their followers. A primary resource examined in the \nliterature is time available from managers to interact with and provide other resources to \nsubordinates. Dansereau et al. (1975) noted that the size of the workgroup directly impacted the \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n8 \ntime managers can spend with their subordinates. Judge and Ferris (1993) similarly suggested \nthat the larger the span of control the less actual manager-follower contact occurs. Still other \nresearchers (e.g., Cogliser & Schriesheim, 2000; Goodstadt & Kipnis, 1970; Green et al., 1996) \nproposed or found support for this contention. Time effects, however, have not been any more \nconsistent regarding LMX than have studies of span of control. In a study by Kinicki and \nVecchio (1994) time constraints were actually positively related to LMX quality while Cogliser \nand Schriesheim (2000) found no relationship leaving open the question of possible differences \nin bases of relationship quality associated with a manager\u2019s time. An examination of the \ndifferential process for the development and maintenance of exchanges based on different \ncurrencies of exchange offers an alternative view to a rigid resource constraint approach. Rather \nthan the actual time spend with followers, we argue that the different results found for the impact \nof span of control on LMX are due to the different effects of span of control on the different \nLMX dimensions. We thus explore the question whether leader distance is responsible for the \neffect of span of control on LMX relationships.  \nAccording to Napier and Ferris (1993), organizational distance is comprised of physical \ndistance, structural distance, and functional distance (Napier & Ferris, 1993). The leadership \ndistance literature (e.g., Antonakis & Atwater, 2002; Napier & Ferris, 1993; Shamir, 1995; \nWeibler 2004) defines leader distance as consisting of status and power distance, physical \ndistance, and infrequent contact with followers. The latter two are especially characteristic for \nlarge spans of control. Antonakis and Atwater\u2019s (2002) review and extension of the leader \ndistance literature holds that leaders and followers may operate at different distances from one \nanother. While high quality LMX relationships have been conceptualized as falling in the \ncategory of \u201cclose\u201d relationships, with quality diminishing as distance increases, Antonakis and \nAtwater\u2019s (2002) position challenges the universality of this notion by suggesting that followers \ncan identify with leaders whether social distance is large or small. This identification implies that \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n9 \nfollowers can ascribe or, as noted by Shamir (1995), attribute, characteristics to leaders even \nwhen distant, while in closer relationships they base their judgment on actual leader behaviour \nrather than attribution.   \nTherefore, the question arises as to whether and which LMX dimensions are more or less \nlikely to occur in the case of small or large leader distance. Research and theory concerning \npsychological distance and level of construal (Liberman, Trope & Stephan 2007) facilitates the \nanswer to this question.  \n \n\u201cAccording to CLT [construal level theory], individuals use concrete, low-level \nconstruals to represent near events and abstract, high-level construal to represent distant \nevents. Low-level construals are relatively unstructured, contextualized representations \nthat include subordinate and incidental features of events. High-level construals, in \ncontrast, are schematic, decontextualized representations that extract the gist from \navailable information.\u201d (Trope, Liberman & Wakslak, 2007, p. 83).  \n \nPsychological distance is characterised by temporal, spatial and social distance as well as \nhypotheticality (referring to decisions under uncertain outcomes; Trope et al., 2007). Leader \ndistance can be set into relation to this construct in so far as both comprise spatial and social \ndistance. We therefore assume that some of the predictions Trope et al. (2007) make with regard \nto psychological distance are valid for leader distance as well. According to Trope et al. (2007), \npsychological distance leads to a higher level of abstraction in representations of events. \nTransferring this assumption to leader distance, we argue that in cases of higher leader distance \nor large spans of control, more abstract representations of the leader-member relationship will be \nmore relevant.  To apply this thought to the different dimensions of LMX we need to look closer \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n10 \nat the dimensions of LMX suggested by Dienesch and Liden (1986) and Liden and Maslyn \n(1998) in order to determine their level of abstraction.  \nThe dimension \u201caffect\u201d comprises items referring to liking and direct work experience, \nthus is not abstract. Liden & Maslyn (1998) specifically note that a characteristic of this \ndimension involves frequent interaction because the members enjoy each others\u2019 company.  \n\u201cContribution\u201d is characterised by the \u201cperception of the amount, direction and quality of work-\noriented\u201d (Dienesch & Liden, 1986: 624) contributions of the follower, again something that is \nrelated to direct experience and does not imply leader distance. That means that the currencies \nbeing exchanged when relationships are based on contribution and affect need to be replenished \nfrequently. As with closer forms of manager-follower relationships, we consider that \ncontribution and affect are based less on attribution and more on direct interaction between \nmanagers and followers. The reason for this assumption is that the dimensions of contribution \nand affect are more specific in their scope and impact on followers, characterized by an \ninterdependence that Uhl-Bien, Graen and Scandura (2000) note is typical of high quality, \n\u201cclose\u201d LMX relationships. Specifically, contribution\u2019s definition as a \u201cperception of the current \nlevel of work-oriented activity each member puts forth toward the mutual goals (explicit or \nimplicit) of the dyad\u201d (Liden & Maslyn, 1998, p. 50) implies more frequent short-term \nexchanges. Similarly, the affect dimension of LMX includes \u201cpersonally rewarding components \nand outcomes (e.g., a friendship)\u201d (Liden & Maslyn, 1998, p. 50) suggestive of frequent \nexchanges and investments on the part of dyad members.  \nWe suggest that the LMX dimensions of loyalty and professional respect can and do exist \nfrom a \u201cdistance.\u201d That is, followers can obtain these currencies based on their beliefs and \nexpectations of the leader without experiencing them directly, but instead through vicarious \nmeans such as the reputation of their manager. \u201cProfessional Respect\u201d, for example, refers to the \nfollower\u2019s appreciation of the leader\u2019s professional abilities. It is a rather abstract construct as it \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n11 \nis not comprised of specificities of what this respect is exactly built on or what it refers to. For \nprofessional respect, work on the importance of expectations of competence (e.g., Liden, Wayne \n& Stilwell, 1993) and the importance of expert power (Antonakis & Atwater, 2002) support this \ncontention. Having an admirable reputation as an expert provides potential present and future \nvalue to followers, even if it is accessed only occasionally. Further, the maintenance of this \nexpertise requires little extra work on the part of managers beyond normal day-to-day \ninteractions with followers in general or with others in the organization because reputation is by \ndefinition a social phenomenon. As such, once developed, professional respect is likely to \ncontinue as a valid currency without placing either continued demands on the manager, or \nincreased demands across multiple followers. \nIn the same way loyalty to each other, or the expression of public support or the \nexpectation that the manager will remain faithful in that support from situation to situation \n(Liden & Maslyn, 1998), does not require constant reinforcement by managers but only the \nabsence of disloyalty. The items of the LMX-MDM bear out that the value of loyalty is found in \na future expectation -- two of the three items of the loyalty subscale include statements such as \n\u201cMy supervisor would come to my defence if\u2026\u201d and \u201cMy supervisor would defend me to others \nin this organization if\u2026\u201d Because of this expectation loyalty can exist at a distance or be \nconsidered valuable by subordinates without a manager ever demonstrating loyalty directly or \nfrequently. Further, in terms of construal theory, loyalty is a hypothetical dimension (\u201cMy \nsupervisor would come to my defense if I were \u201cattacked\u201d by others\u201d) implying a higher \nconstrual level. \nConsequently, we propose that contribution and affect are more characteristic in close \nleader-member relationships with high quality of LMX relationships, thus, in large spans of \ncontrol resulting in fewer subordinates with high quality relationships. Loyalty and professional \nrespect on the other hand are currencies that do not demand frequent exchange but instead are \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n12 \ncharacteristics that can be achieved even in the case of psychological or leader distance. On the \nbasis of these arguments, we propose the following: \nProposition 1a: In large spans of control, there will be a negative relationship \nbetween span of control and contribution and affect. \n \nProposition 1b: In large spans of control, a greater number of quality LMX \nrelationships will be based on the dimensions of loyalty and professional respect \nthan on contribution and affect.  \n \nGroup Level: The influence of span of control on consensus regarding different LMX \ncurrencies of exchange \nMuch of the research on LMX has focused on the outcomes of a good relationship \nquality between leader and his or her subordinates, often differentiating between an in-group \nof trusted members and an out-group of members with whom a purely contractual \nrelationship is upheld (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). In the context of the larger workgroup, \ndifferentiation research has shown that consensus among followers of the same leader is an \nimportant predictor of organisational outcomes. Research indicates that perceived differences \nin LMX quality within groups affects the judgments of co-workers\u2019 use of ingratiation \n(Maslyn & Uhl-Bien, 2005), negatively influences job satisfaction and well-being (Hooper & \nMartin, 2008); that similarity in LMX is positively related to co-worker exchange \n(Wikaningrum, 2007) and that the variability of one dimension of LMX (contribution, cf. \nLiden & Maslyn, 1998) is negatively related to satisfaction and commitment (Schyns, 2006). \nThese studies underscore that it is beneficial for leaders to uphold positive relationships with \nall members of their workgroups. Henderson et al. (2008) extended this line of inquiry to \nexamine differentiation from both the individual-within-group and group levels and found \nthat LMX at both levels significantly predicted judgments of psychological contract \nfulfilment. They noted that variability in LMX quality at the group level was dysfunctional \nbut interestingly also noted that differentiation could be functional under certain \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n13 \ncircumstances, for example, when differentiation is based on individual contribution and, \nthus, accepted by other followers (see also van Breukelen & Weselius, 2007).  \nBesides empirical work showing negative effects of lack of consensus in LMX \nquality, simple differential treatment of followers by their leaders has been proposed to have \nimplications for justice or perceived fairness. Empirical research is inconclusive at this stage: \nVan Breukelen, Konst and van der Vlist (2002) as well as Sias and Jablin (1995) look into the \neffect of differential leader treatment on LMX relations. While Van Breukelen et al. (2002) \nfound no direct effect of differential treatment, they found an interaction effect of differential \ntreatment and LMX quality on commitment. Sias and Jablin (1995), on the other hand, found \na direct effect of differential treatment on communication between co-workers. In a \ntheoretical contribution, Scandura (1999) suggests that justice and LMX are closely related \nand that justice is associated with the differentiation between in- and out-group. In an \nempirical study Pillai, Scandura and Williams (1999) showed that distributive justice \nmediated the relationship between LMX and job satisfaction in US, Australian, Columbian \nand Middle Eastern samples. Ansari et al. (2007) extended this research, using commitment \nand turnover intention as outcomes. They found that procedural justice mediated the \nrelationship between the respect dimension of LMX and commitment in a Malaysian sample. \nConsequently, not only should the expected good results associated with high quality LMX \nrelationships motivate leaders to uphold as many positive relationships as possible but a \njustice or fairness perspective make treating followers similarly appear vital ethically. \nConsequently, both research on LMX differentiation and its results as well as LMX \ndifferentiation and justice have led some LMX scholars to recommend to leaders to avoid \ndifferentiation (e.g., Uhl-Bien et al., 2000).  \nIn essence, two broad levels of consensus can be differentiated: Followers of the same \nleader can agree in their rating regarding the relationship with their leader on a high or a low \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n14 \nlevel of LMX quality. Extreme variability or a lack of consensus, on the other hand, would \nlead to a mid-level LMX average. In accordance with the positive outcomes of high quality \nLMX relationships, on the one hand, and consensus, on the other hand, in this paper, we are \nmost interested in the consensus among followers of the same leader with regard to their \nindividual (dyadic relationship between one leader and one follower) relationship quality on a \nhigh level of LMX quality. That is, high consensus with an average high LMX quality at the \nsame time. However, as we have argued above, depending on the number of followers \nreporting to one leader, establishing a good relationship quality with all followers and, thus, \nachieving high consensus on high quality LMX might be next to impossible in large spans of \ncontrol. Again, examining the different dimensions of LMX can be useful to differentiate \nwhich type of consensus is achievable and which is not achievable because consensus in \nLMX must be built from the bottom up (Graen, 2009).  \nWe argued above that different dimensions of LMX can be related to different levels \nof closeness \/ distance, namely, that high LMX between leaders and followers with a large \nleader distance will be characterised by loyalty and respect rather than affect and \ncontribution. In large spans of control, not all followers can be close to the supervisor, \nmeaning that consensus regarding LMX quality is unlikely to be built on dimensions that \nneed closeness, such as affect and contribution. However, loyalty and respect can flourish in \nthe case of leader distance as well, making it more likely that if consensus develops at all in \nlarge spans of control, it will be shaped by loyalty and respect.  \n \nProposition 2: In large spans of control, followers are more likely to have a high \nconsensus concerning the LMX dimensions of loyalty and professional respect and \na low consensus concerning the LXM dimensions of affect and contribution. \n \nSummary and Discussion \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n15 \nAs Johns (2006) argues, the influence of context on organisational behaviour \u201cis often \nunrecognized or underappreciated\u201d (p. 389). With this paper, we bring organization structure \nand practice in the form of span of control to a discussion of leadership as it is a potential key \nfactor for organisational context in which leader-member relationships are placed (see also \nPorter & McLaughlin, 2006).  \nThough there is some consideration within LMX theory regarding contextual factors, \nour analysis takes the discussion into a rather new direction. Instead of only demonstrating \nthat certain effects (e.g., satisfaction) go along with different sizes of span of control (e.g., \nnarrow), or that larger spans of control are necessarily associated with lower average LMX \nquality, as prior research has done, our contribution has argued that analysing the different \ndimensions of LMX quality more closely, leads to an insight into the working of LMX in \nlarge groups. As such, we look at dimensions of LMX as a means to collectively examine \nboth bottom-up influences on consensus (Graen, 2009) with top-down or contextual realities \nin organizations.  One the one hand, the idea that relationships can be built on different \ndimensions can explain the contradictory results of prior studies that were based on \ncomposite LMX measures. On the other hand, it can support leaders in coping with large \nspans of control more effectively. That is, we identify means by which managers may build \ngreater high quality LMX consensus within their workgroups even under conditions of larger \nspans of control. Our focus was on individual level as well group level LMX (consensus) as a \nfunction of different dimensions of LMX, an approach consistent with researchers who \nsuggested or found that LMX operates at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously \n(Henderson et al., 2008).   \nWe postulated that different currencies of exchange between managers and their \nsubordinates will have different effects on LMX quality consensus, depending on how \nnecessary personal interaction or psychological closeness might be for the different \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n16 \ncurrencies involved in the exchange process. We suggested that the \u201caffect\u201d and \n\u201ccontribution\u201d currencies needed to be exchanged more frequently and more directly, thus \nmaking low leader distance necessary. Loyalty and professional respect, on the other hand, \nrely more on attribution processes and can, therefore, be developed and sustained in large \ngroups. Integrating leader distance into LMX, is a new way of looking at the different \ndimensions of LMX. While so far, the question leading to the development of dimensions \nwas mainly how leader-member relationships can be described (Liden & Maslyn, 1998; \nBerneth et al., 2007), we explained how the different dimensions contribute to positive \nleader-member relationships in specific context (small versus large span of control). \nPractical Implications and Future Research \nBased on our discussion, some practical implications can be articulated. Regarding \nthe broader or more narrowly based impact of different currencies of exchange, leaders can \nbe trained to show and communicate more consciously the professional respect and loyalty \ndimensions in their exchanges with subordinates instead of relying as heavily on the \ncontribution and affect dimensions. Again, a high level of professional respect and loyalty \ncan be accomplished from a \u201cdistance\u201d by communicating critical incidents where examples \nof professional capabilities and loyalty were present.  This approach can create the \nexpectation that these are characteristic of the leader more generally.  Before such an \napproach is recommended and applied, however, more research is necessary as to the \ndifferent outcomes that are likely to accompany each unique dimension. For example, Liden \nand Maslyn (1998) found that contribution is highly related to organizational commitment, \nwhile loyalty is highly related to leader-rated performance. Future research needs to \ninvestigate in how far these relationships are stable in different spans of control. \nIn terms of large spans of control and the creation of LMX beyond professional \nrespect and loyalty, an on-going discussion has emerged as to how leaders can more \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n17 \neffectively differentiate among followers (Maslyn & Uhl-Bien, 2005). This more \ninstrumental approach to relationship development suggests that in cases where factors such \nas span of control present constraints on managers\u2019 time spent with individual subordinates \n(large leader distance), manager\u2019s efforts should be invested in fewer targeted subordinates as \nopposed to most or all subordinates (Liden et al., 2006). For example, Liden et al. (1997) \nproposed that under such circumstances managers would be advised to establish higher \nquality relationships with those followers that possess greater network centrality. Harmon and \nVan Dyne (2008) also suggest prescriptive role-making with a recommendation that \nmanagers target top performers within work groups for the development of high quality \nrelationships. Consequently by targeting such employees, leaders could strive to substitute for \ntheir own lack of possibility to establish LMX relationships on the basis of affect and \ncontribution. However, this discussion implies that the decision to target certain employees is \nmade on an explicit level. Looking into research that shows that, for example, value \nsimilarity is positively related to the development of a high quality exchange relationship \n(e.g., Ashkanasy & O'Connor, 1997) may imply that the differentiation in LMX relationships \nis made unconsciously. That would mean, that before using the approach of targeting \nfollowers instrumentally, leaders need to be made aware of their choices and the implications \nof these choices. \nThe development of high quality LMX relationships with targeted followers are then \nlikely to be the key contributors in creating co-worker exchange (CWX, Sherony & Green, \n2002). CWX is conceptualized as a dyadic process between respective team members along \nsimilar dimensions as used by LMX. Drawing from balance theory (Heider, 1958), Sherony \nand Green (2002) showed that there was a tendency within individuals to balance exchange \nqualities between triads (leader-member and member-member relationships). This indicates \nthat a good CWX quality would lead to a good LMX quality even considering \u201cclose\u201d LMX \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n18 \ndimensions such as affect and contribution. Sherony and Green (2002) suggested that a few \npositive LMX relationships with certain co-workers could have a contagion effect on the \nwhole team. Thus, leaders who are able to establish and maintain high-quality LMX \nrelationships with significant co-workers will provoke direct positive effects on exchange \nrelationships between co-workers.  \nThe possibility of influencing targeted co-workers, however, depends on the group \nstructure. Leadership research has just begun exploring this topic (e.g., Balkundi & Kilduff \n2006; Graen & Graen 2006; Mayo, Meindl & Pastor, 2003; Uhl-Bien, 2006). For example, \nBalkundi and Kilduff (2006) outline a network approach to leadership, emphasizing the need \nto include different relationships into the leadership process. When introducing the notion of \ntarget co-workers, one has to take into account that relying on others enhances the \ndependency on them and leads \u2013 in this case and at least indirectly \u2013to a shared leadership \napproach (see, for instance, Pearce & Conger, 2003) where efficiency of a work group is \ndependent on the productive co-acting of different formal and informal leaders. Therefore, \norganisational support for LMX relationship should concentrate either on the optimal match \nbetween a leader and the situation or on shaping selected substitutes or context factors which \nsupport superiors to lead larger groups effectively. \nIf we broaden our view regarding in terms of networks of leadership and look into \norganisational \u201cchains of command\u201d, we recognize that leaders are mostly followers \nthemselves. This means that as with their own followers, they are members of their respective \nleaders\u2019 in- or out-group (Graen, Cashman, Ginsburg & Schiemann, 1977). Weibler (1994; \n2004), for instance, empirically demonstrated that the next higher leader influences the ease \nwith which a leader-member relationship are managed. Thus, we can assume that the \npossibilities as well the effectiveness of more positive LMX relationships based on different \ndimensions will be influenced by a powerful and resourceful next higher leader. If leaders do \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n19 \nnot share a good relationship quality with their own leader, they may have fewer resources \navailable to establish many high quality LMX relationships with followers. For example, if \nfollowers perceive that the next higher leader does not respect their leader professionally, this \nmay lead to lower follower respect as well.  \nResearchers should also consider factors potentially affecting leader distance and \nLMX quality, such as the use of a team structure and variance in relationship tenure. Leaders \nwho interact and communicate with followers regularly on a one-to-one basis (direct reports, \ne.g., sales and distribution), those that have only one team versus several teams, or those \nwhose subordinates are located in different regions (e.g., research and development), are \nlikely to have different experiences regarding LMX and span of control. For example, \ncontagion effects may be limited in non-collocated workgroups. Within different teams, \ndifferent levels of leader distance can emerge, influencing the dimension of LMX quality \nrelevant to that group.  \nPossibly, this notion is also dependent on follower characteristics that might be \nconducive to high levels of consensus regarding LMX. One example comprises followers\u2019 \nimplicit leadership theories as prior research has shown that implicit leadership theories are \nrelated to the perception of leadership (e.g., Schyns, Felfe & Blank, 2007). Assuming that the \nsame is true for LMX, it could be argued that when followers agree in their implicit \nleadership theories, they will also agree more in terms of their perception of LMX quality and \nthe related dimensions. However, in a large span of control, achieving consensus among \nfollowers may be difficult simply due to the fact that there will be many different views. For \nexample, in a large group, some followers may be more or less likely to accept professional \nrespect as part of a good LMX relationship. \nOther follower-oriented research might consider the role of followers\u2019 needs in their \nperception of LMX quality. For example, Schyns, Kroon and Moors (2008) found that \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n20 \nfollower needs are related to their perception of LMX quality. They argue that follower needs \nare relevant for leaders as they can only establish good relationships with their followers if \nthey are aware of their followers\u2019 needs. Again, in a large span of control, aligning followers\u2019 \nneeds can be more difficult than in a small span of control. This is in line with diversity \nresearch which suggests that in order to cooperate and agree on issues, similarity in terms of \nvalues and needs (deep level diversity as opposed to surface level diversity which is based on \ndemographic dissimilarity) among members of the same group is crucial. Transferring this \nprior research into consensus and span of control, we would expect that with a larger span of \ncontrol, the advantage of leading teams \u2013 in contrast to isolated followers \u2013 is only and \nundoubtedly conducive to high level, high consensus LMX when followers are similar in \ntheir implicit leadership theories and in their needs, and thus show deep level similarity.   \nIn this paper, we have concentrated on the effects a large span of control has on \nindividual and group level LMX (consensus) and how the suggested negative effects can be \novercome by emphasizing different dimensions of the LMX relationship. However, we did \nnot consider the effects of a large span of control on the agreement between leader and \nfollower on their mutual relationship. Prior research has shown that, although we would \nexpect a high agreement between leader and member when rating their mutual relationship, \nthis is not the case (Gerstner & Day, 1997). According to Liberman et al. (2007), power can \nimply social distance, meaning that leaders see themselves as separate from their followers. \nThey argue that power leads to more abstract perceptions. With respect to LMX relationships, \nwe could thus assume that especially in large spans of control that have been associated with \nlarger structurally induced distance and larger power distance (Napier & Ferris, 1993), \nsupervisors will tend to view relationship in a more abstract way than followers. \nConsequently, leaders may perceive more respect and loyalty rather than affect and \ncontribution while this may be different for followers. Given that Gibson, Cooper and Conger \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n21 \n(2009) argue and find that perceptual distance between a leader and his\/her team negatively \naffects team performance, this is an important area for future research. \nOur focus in this paper was on span of control as an indicator of leader distance. \nLooking into the literature around leader distance, span of control is only one indicator of \nleader distance. An interesting route to pursue in future research would be to look into the \npersonality of the leader and how it can convey psychological distance leading to similar \nconstrains regarding the dimensions of LMX that define good relationship qualities as \nindicated here for span of control. The example of attachment styles may illustrate this point:  \nAttachment styles are differentiated into avoidant, anxious, and secure (Ainsworth, \nBlehar, Waters & Wall, 1978; Hazan & Shaver, 1987). Essentially, individuals with an \navoidant attachment style do not look for relationships but rather try to avoid establishing \nrelationships, preferring to work alone (Hazan & Shaver, 1990). In the workplace, managers \nwith this style are likely to be inattentive, manipulative, and provide little interpersonal \nsupport to subordinates (Keller & Cacioppe, 2001), characteristics that could be used to \ndescribe distance. Therefore, managers with this attachment style would not be expected to \nbe willing or able to develop many high quality relationships. In contrast, individuals that \nshow an anxious attachment style are concerned about relationships to fulfil their need for \nattachment (Hazan & Shaver, 1990). Keller and Cacioppe (2001) suggest that leaders with \nthis attachment style may be attentive to followers as a means of creating dependence by \nfollowers on the leader, though still not trusting in their competence. This one-sided \nrelationship runs counter to a high quality LMX relationship where there is mutual \ndependence and a high level of trust between members of the dyad (Graen & Uhl-Bien, \n1995). \nFinally, leaders with a secure attachment style feel comfortable about interdependence \nwith others and have been shown to recognize and balance the needs of the parties to the \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n22 \nrelationship (Hazan & Shaver, 1987). Leadership research has linked a secure attachment \nstyle to relational competence (Manning, 2003), and to transformational leadership behaviour \nsuch as individualized consideration and intellectual stimulation (Popper & Mayseless, 2003; \nPopper Mayseless, & Castelnovo 2000). Keller and Cacioppe (2001) note that secure-type \nleaders \u201cmay positively approach their leadership role and express more certainty of their \nability to perform well in that role\u201d (p. 72). These characteristics are consistent with high \nquality LMX relationships (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). Thus, with respect to leader distance, \nwe can assume that only a secure attachment style allows the closeness that the LMX \ndimensions affect and contribution need to be developed and maintained even when other \nfactors might suggest a greater distance between leader and follower. \nConclusion \nIn conclusion, this overview identified how focusing on different dimensions of LMX \ncan explain the effects of span of control on individual and group level LMX, and also \nprovides guidance for organisations that wish to expand the number of high quality \nrelationships within their expanding workgroups. Although some recent research has \nidentified certain conditions under which differentiation may be beneficial (e.g., Liden et al., \n2006, van Breuekelen & Weselius, 2007), overall we believe that an understanding of how to \nmaximize LMX quality within groups is important for researchers and managers alike. \n  \nUnderstanding The Relationship Between Span of Control And Leader-Member Exchange \n23 \nReferences \nAinsworth, M.
