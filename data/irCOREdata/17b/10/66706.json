She suggested that the selling of locally\nmade grain beer for cash, and its consumption in commercial clubs, had\nplayed a major role in altering relationships between young and old, and\nmen and women. Generational separation had broken down: young\nmen had lost respect for elder men and women had acquired a new\neconomic autonomy founded on the cash income they earned from\nselling beer. Beer thus lay at the heart of a pattern of social change\n(1977: 186).\nThis article examines changes in authority and the drinking of beer in\nNyakyusa society from the 1890s-when written records become\navailable-to the end of the twentieth century. It argues that patterns of\ndeference and authority have suffered less dislocation than Wilson\nsuggested and that-while locally made grain beer has been physically\ntransformed, has disappeared from certain public rituals of well-being\nand has come increasingly into the cash market-its commoditisation\nhas not necessarily empowered women, nor has it eliminated the role of\nbeer in patterns of behaviour and discourse which sustain elder men's\nclaims to authority.\nDRINKING POWER\nIn 1970 MacAndrew and Edgerton's Drunken Comportment challenged\na generation of literature which had focused on alcohol's chemically\ndefined role as a disinhibitor (see, for example, Emerson, 1934: v-vi).\nMacAndrew and Edgerton suggested that drunken behaviour in any\nculture is actually learned, rather than being the inevitable consequence\nof chemical processes (1970: 87-8), and went on to argue that in many\nsocieties drinking is associated with 'time out', that is, drink defines\nmoments in which the bounds of normally accepted behaviour may be\nchallenged (ibid.: 89-90, 166-8). Their argument, which will seem\nfamiliar enough to any student of Gluckman, was that such moments of\ninversion serve ultimately to reinforce norms of behaviour (ibid.: 169;\nsee also Dennis, 1979: 60; Adler, 1991: 387; Akyeampong, 1996: 8).\nJUSTIN WILUS is a Senior Research and Development Associate in the Department of History\nat the University of Durham. He has worked widely on the social and political history of East\nAfrica in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\n374 NYAIZUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s\nThe implication of the MacAndrew and Edgerton argument was that\n'time out' was not the only possible learned manifestation of\ndrunkenness. Subsequent scholarship has built on their arguments to\nmove decisively away from the assumption of disinhibition while\npreserving the idea that in almost all human societies there is an\nexpectation that drink defines moments in which behaviour is deemed\nto be of particular significance. This has inspired both functionalist\nanalyses of the 'purpose' of drinking-in which it is argued that 'the\nceremonials of drinking construct an ideal world' (Douglas, 1987: 8;\nsee also Marshall, 1979: 3, 451-7)-and quite different studies which\nfocus on the idea that drinking moments provide space for what Scott\nwould call challenges to 'transcripts of authority' (Levine, 1983;\nMorgan, 1983; Scott, 1990: 121; Barrows, 1991). This article will\nsuggest that the idea that drink creates particularly significant moments\nof behaviour can be more usefully set in the context of a theory of\npractice (Bourdieu, 1977). In this approach drinking moments are\nladen, carrying an especial importance in the daily remaking of\nassumptions about behaviour and propriety which serve as 'structuring\nstructures'. The article will argue further-rather against Bourdieu-\nthat this especial social weight extends also to the ways in which people\ntalk about drinking. Through drinking, and through talking about\ndrinking, people make and remake the assumptions about proper\nbehaviour, and about power, on which social authority rests.\nTHE DECLINE OF GOOD COMPANY\nThe ideal of ukwangala, or 'good company', was central to Monica\nWilson's idea of how Nyakyusa society worked in the past, and was\ncentral to her ideas of how the values of that society were undermined\nby twentieth-century change. In her eyes the convivial company of age\nmates of one's own sex was a central element in Nyakyusa ideas\nof pleasure and well-being (1963: 66-7, 1977: 85). Through such\nmoments elder men in particular would acknowledge, while sharing\nfood and millet beer, their mutual involvement in a community of\ninterest through which they dominated society as a whole; and they\nwould avert the ever-present danger posed by the jealous murmurings\nof the 'breath of men' by the unexpressed resentment of peers, and by\nwitchcraft consequent on such resentment, all of which might bring ill\nhealth (1959: 66,123,1963: 55,72,78,101,106,32,62). Fear of the\ndangers of witchcraft and the breath of men permeated society, and\nunderlay a kind of ritual balance between chiefs-who claimed a power\nof their own over what Feierman might call 'social health'-and the\ninnate power of elder men over the well-being of other individuals\n(Wilson, 1959: 2-3, 39, 1963: 127; Feierman, 1990: 94). The\nseparation between different generations that was inherent in the idea\nof good company was bound up with the idea that elder men held\nparticular power over one another's well-being, and over the health of\ntheir male and female juniors (Wilson, 1957: 179, 1977: 87); and the\nsuperior status of old men was marked by their exclusive access to millet\nNYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s 375\nbeer, the lubricant of their social engagements with one another and the\neffective means of encouraging the 'speaking out' which dispelled\ndangerous resentments.\nWilson argued that this idealisation of 'good company' was under-\nmined by changes in settlement patterns and in the Nyakyusa economy\nin the twentieth century (1963: 175-6). Young men acquired access to\ncash, particularly as migrant labourers in a regional colonial economy\nwhich took many of them a thousand miles south to the mines of the\nRand, and they used that cash to buy cattle for bridewealth-thus\nevading the control over their reproductive powers which had been\nexercised by bridewealth-paying fathers. Even more subversively they\nbought beer which they drank with their fellows or even with their\nfathers (ibid.: 69, 176). The very nature of beer changed. Women, the\nbeer makers of Nyakyusa society, started to make and sell maize beer\nrather than millet beer. And the cash income which women came to\nderive from selling beer gave them a new economic autonomy (1977:\n131). A new imperative to individual accumulation undermined the\ncommitment to generosity between age mates and, at the same time,\npopulation growth and the new economic importance of standing tree\ncrops like tea and coffee ended a former pattern of generationally\nshifting settlement which had made practicable the strict separation of\nfathers and sons (1959: 221, 1977: 185). Wilson cited at length the\nopinion of a chief (when it was recorded is unclear) which firmly located\nchanges in drinking as the root of a decline in the proper authority of\nelders:\nYoung men returning from work have less respect for seniors than formerly.\nWhat brings disrespect is beer; formerly the young did not drink beer, but\nnow they come with their own money and buy and drink. Beer brings pride.\nA junior quarrels with an elder and seizes a spear. Beer used to belong to the\nolder men. Yes, it belonged to men, there was none for sale, and juniors did\nnot get any. [1977: 93]\nYet this vision of drinking change and its relation to a decline in\n'respect' for elders rests on a particular understanding of Nyakyusa\nsociety in the nineteenth century. A reappraisal of the evidence on this\nsuggests that Wilson's portrayal of the past may overstate the hegemony\nexercised by elder men and, conversely, that her understanding of\ntwentieth-century trajectories of change may overstate the decline in the\nauthority of elders.\nAUTHORITY AND DRINKING IN LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY NYAKYUSA: A\nREAPPRAISAL\nIn Wilson's analysis of nineteenth-century Nyakyusa society the age\nvillage was central in ensuring 'good company': her work repeatedly\nstressed the unique nature of this social institution (1963: 18, 157). At a\ncertain age young men would move, as a group, out of their fathers'\nhomes and go to establish a new village under the rule of one of the sons\n376 NYAIZUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s\nof the ruling chief. This establishment of new villages always involved a\nbifurcation-two sons of each chief would establish new villages (1959:\n49-62, 1963: 19-31). The villages thus established were based not on\nkinship but on age, and thus was created a political and social\ncommunity of men of similar age, a community which was linked with\nthe political structure of chiefly rule (1 959: 94).\nYet, central as the age village was to Wilson's analysis, there is a\ncuriously unobserved quality to these institutions. Wilson (and others)\nnoted in the 1930s, her most intensive period of fieldwork, that the\nactual composition of village settlements among the Nyakyusa did not\nreflect the ideal rules of settlement formation that she and her husband\nrecorded from their informants (Wilson, 1959: 92,1963: 35-7;\nMcKenny, 1973). In her analysis this lack of fit between observed\nreality and supposed rules was the result of a process of breakdown that\nwas already in train in the 1930s, but there is an alternative explanation:\nthat age villages had never existed in their ideal form, and that\ndescriptions of these phenomena were a retrospective creation of a\nmodel of age separation and authority which had never really achieved\nsuch a settled form.\nWilson herself noted-with evident puzzlement-that despite the\npresence of missionaries in the area from 1891, and despite the\nexistence of a more or less effective colonial administration from 1894,\nno previous observer had mentioned the existence of the age villages\n(1963: 158). This omission is all the more striking since it does not\nreflect a simple lack of evidence; there were several brief published\naccounts of the area, and two lengthier ethnographic reports. One of\nthese was the work of Theodor Meyer, a Moravian missionary resident\nin the area from 1891 to 1916 (Meyer, 1993); the other was prepared\nby Northcote, a British administrator, for the Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, in 1931. 1 These sources make no mention of\nage villages.\nIn the late nineteenth-century accounts, chiefs appear as squabbling\nprincelings vying for followers (Charsley, 1969: 70). Seeking always to\nattract young men to their settlements with the aim of building up their\npower to raid, they were in competition with household heads as much\nas with other chiefs, for they sought to undermine the efforts of married\nmen to control the labour of younger men, who as sons or prospective\nsons-in-law would be expected to put in labour in the crucial male\nsphere of hoeing land for planting each year. Elder men sought to use\ntheir control over cattle and\/or marriageable young women to maintain\ntheir claim on young men's labour (de Jonge, 1985). Behind these\nclaims lay the authority derived from their presumed power to harm the\n1 I have not been able to locate a full text of this but there are extracts in the Southern\nHighland Provincial Book and the Rungwe District Book, in the Tanzania National Archives\n(TNA). These extracts describe the succession of chiefs, but do not identify it with the wider\nprocess of generational succession.\nNYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s 377\nwell-being of their juniors, either through their own wrath or through\ntheir ability to stir or placate the anger of deceased elders (Meyer, 1993:\n69, 212).\nThe sources dating from before the 1930s make clear the importance\nof drinking practice in creating this presumption of power: 'Beer is\ndrink for men and Gods,' noted one missionary (Mackenzie, 1925:\n128). Millet beer was constantly given to elder men and used by them\nin circumstances which suggested that the goodwill of elders was\nessential for well-being: 'the important things [in rituals] are beer and\nmeat' (Meyer, 1993: 74). In marriage negotiations and in weddings, in\nfunerals and in propitiatory offerings to recently deceased kin, and most\nof all in offerings made by young men who sought the forgiveness of\nelder men whose wrath they had incurred, drinking practice reproduced\nthe idea that the unexpressed anger of elder men was a potent,\ndangerous force, and that millet beer would help elders to express their\ngrievances, and so would dissipate that force (ibid.: 1993: 74,77,82).\nBeer was presented to elder men, was drunk by them and\/or 'blown' out\nover those who sought forgiveness; and was 'blown' over the particular\nbanana sucker which every man kept which was dedicated to the\nrecently deceased members of the patriline (ibid.: 76). Wilson tried to\ncategorise Nyakyusa notions of power over well-being, distinguishing\nwitchcraft, the collective power of elder men, and the curse of a senior\n(1957: 3, 1959: 66; 1963: 91-4, 102). But Meyer's account (and am-\nbiguities in Wilson's own schema) suggest that Nyakyusa ideas of this\npower were contested and in flux, and that all centred around the idea\nof 'snakes' in the intestine of the individual, a power which any\nindividual might possess (Meyer, 1993: 86-104; see also Wilson, 1977:\n69, 138).\nYoung men did 'come out' from their parental homes, reaching an\nage where they sought their fortune. 2 But this event was not directly\nassociated with the 'coming out' of the sones) of a chief (Charsley,\n1969: 116). That too was a process full of conflict, between the chief\nand sons who might seek to supplant him (Fotheringham, 1891: 285).\nA young man anxious to acquire the wherewithal to marry might go to\nlive in the following of a chief, just as he might go to serve a wealthy\nrelative (Meyer, 1993: 134-5, 151), and an ambitious chief might seek\nto gather round himself a group of young men, whom he promised to\nreward with the spoils of raiding-and who took the cue to loot from\nthe households of married men around them (ibid.: 132, 136; see also\nWilson, 1959: 54; Charsley, 1969: 63).3 The authority of these chiefs\nmight be insubstantial-in 1877 one traveller was struck by the\nweakness of the chiefs (Elton, 1879: 331-2)-but the ambitions of such\n2 Neu Langenburg District Annual Report, 1919-20, 11: in TNA library; see also the\nextract from Northcote's report, in the Southern Highlands Provincial Book, TNA.\n3 Violent dispossession features largely in popular memories of pre-colonial chiefship: see\nInts Nya4c, 8; Nya36b, 3.\n378 NYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s\nchiefs might spark off periods of intense raiding, plunging the area\nabruptly into a spate of localised violence and plunder (Charsley, 1969:\n47, 116).4 Chiefs feasted their followers, in defiance of elder men's\nclaimed prerogative over alcoholic beverages. In even more striking\ndefiance of the authority of elders, chiefs might subvert their claim to\nguarantee health by performing their own rituals, including, in one\nrecorded instance, blowing beer over a group of young warriors (ibid.:\n1969: 67). Drinking practice and discourse reflected, and participated\nin, the contested nature of authority.\nThe followings of chiefs offered refuge for dissatisfied women as well\nas young men. While Wilson believed that marriage among the\nNyakyusa had become more unstable by the 1930s, Meyer's account\nsuggested that adultery, and flight by wives, were not uncommon in the\n1890s (1993: 123, 253-5). Young men who ran away with the wives of\nelder men might find a ready refuge in the village of a chief anxious for\nfollowers (just as they were to do in the twentieth century) (ibid.; 1993:\n98),5 and Meyer's account suggests that single runaway women might\nalso come to join a chiefs following, and might in doing so become\nsexually available to some of his young male following (ibid.: 140). In\nthese ways, too, the claims to authority of chiefs and elder men were\nantagonistic and unformalised, and their antagonism made social space\nfor the subordinate.\nNYAKYUSA UNDER COLONIAL RULE\nDuring the colonial period, access to new resources of power affected\nthe relationship between chiefs, elder men and younger men, providing\nthem with an authority which did not derive from-and was in some\nways inimical to-assumptions about their power over well-being. Yet\nneither chiefs nor elders abandoned their claims over well-being and-\nespecially from the 1920s, when British policies entrenched the role of\nthe past as a discursive field for contest over the present-both chiefs\nand elders increasingly used the recasting of history, as much as the\ndaily recreation of practice, to make and remake the assumptions of\npower on which their authority rested.\nA lengthy process of engagement with missions began in 1891,\noffering access to material patronage-clothes, salt, tools and an\nalternative model of well-being-for those whom the missions favoured\n(Wright, 1972: 162).6 From 1893 the presence of a German colonial\nstate which disposed of considerable coercive resources, as well as\n4 So it was that Fotheringham, visiting the area in November 1889, was struck by the\nubiquity of petty conflicts between chiefs (1891: 287-91), while another traveller, visiting a\nfew months earlier, had thought this a particularly peaceful society: Kerr-Cross, (1890).\n5 For chiefs sheltering runaways in the 1920s, see Rungwe District Annual Report, 1924, 5,\nin TNA library.\n6 Ints Nya25b, 2; Nyal9c, 3.\nNYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s 379\npatronage, changed the nature of contests over authority even more\ndramatically. In the 1920s British officials believed that the German\npolicy of recognising and ruling through a multitude of minor chiefs, to\nwhom the state lent support in return for the efficient collection of tax\nand mobilisation of labour, had increased the effective authority of\nchiefs and made it possible for them to acquire a new degree of wealth\nat the expense of household heads, who were almost routinely subject to\nformalised theft of cattle through 'trials' and fines. 7 As Moore has\nargued of Kilimanjaro in the same period, colonial rule encouraged\nchiefs to serve as 'accumulators' rather than 'redistributors' (1986: 97,\n104); it also meant that a chiefs ability to wield coercive power\nultimately rested less on a following of young men than on relations\nwith the colonial state.\nBritish rule was effectively established in this area in 1917; by the\nmid-1920s the proliferation of minor chiefs had come to be seen as a\nmajor problem in the context of a Tanganyika-wide policy on indirect\nrule which sought the enlargement of political scale as well as the\nmaintenance of tradition.8 In 1926 the British accordingly created two\n'paramounts' and effectively withdrew recognition from many smaller\nchiefs. 9 Several years of repeated disputes over boundaries, recognition\nand most of all over the power of the 'paramounts' led to a further\nreorganisation in 1935 which abolished paramountcies and created a\nnew federation in which a small number of chiefs were recognised and\nallowed to have their own courts. 10 This, the time of the Wilson's major\nfieldwork, was a crucial period. Wilson was later to argue that colonial\nrule strengthened the power of the chiefs as against commoner\n'headmen' and household heads more generally (1977: 70). This had\nalmost certainly been true up to 1930, but district administrators had\nalready become acutely aware of it before the Wilsons arrived, and over\nthe next two decades sought to reduce the power of chiefs. 11 This\nprocess culminated in 1949 with the establishment of a radical new\nsystem of local councils in which 'headmen' and commoners-\nspecifically, 'educated' elders-held a majority. 12 Within these councils\n7 Neu Langenburg District Annual Report, 1919-20, 10, TNA library.\n8 Rungwe District Annual Report, 1923, 8-9, TNA library; Admin.

Incidentally, it should be noted that there is a\nconfusion in English terminology: colonial officials sometimes referred to lesser chiefs\n(balafyale, in Nyakyusa terms) as 'headmen'; Wilson uses this term solely for the non-chiefly\nfigures called mafumu in Nyakyusa usage.\n380 NYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s\nit soon became apparent that the category of 'headmen' (rnafumu) was\nalmost infinitely expandable and could include almost any male\nhousehold head. 13 The councils moved rapidly to curtail the power of\nchiefs, particularly in the crucial area of their control over local courts. 14\nThis series of reforms and new administrative schemes ensured that\nNyakyusa chiefs, far from being secure in their influence, were\nconstantly anxious at the challenges to their authority from rival chiefs\nand from elder men. In this situation they turned to history to bolster\ntheir claims. Their awareness of the potential importance of the\nWilsons, as intermediaries with higher authority, was made explicit in\nthe remark of one disgruntled would-be chief: 'You all ask me about\n[clan histories], but you don't give me a court!,15 The elaboration of an\nethnographic past in which chiefly power dovetailed with generational\ndominance, and in which the rituals of chiefly power were also those of\ngenerational succession, must be understood in this context: the idea of\nformalised age villages was an invention of chiefs and would-be chiefs\nwho sought to legitimise their power by establishing it as part of the\ngenerational routine of succession. A similarly striking invention of the\nperiod, also taken up in Wilson's analysis, was the idea that all the\nchiefs, the balafyaIe, were in some way related to one another and\ncomposed a distinct ethnic group which had come relatively recently\nto impose its dominion on the indigenes (Wilson, 1959: 1, 1963: 3).\nThere is, quite simply, no hint of this in reports from the earlier period,\nin which people and the multiple competing lineages of chiefs were all\nrepresented as being of heterogeneous origins (Meyer, 1993: 28-30; see\nalso Wilson, 1957: 16).16 It would seem that the idea ofa chiefly line,\nlike the notion of 'the Nyakyusa' as a bounded ethnic group, was an\ninvention of the twentieth century (Wright, 1972: 154).\nThe chiefs were not alone in recasting history. Throughout these\nyears the relationship between elder men and chiefs shifted, from\nhostility to alliance, as all wrestled to assert authority over young men\nand women. Historical presentations of the seamless link between\nmen's authority and chiefs authority suited elder men too. By the later\n1920s there was already substantial labour migration; 17 by the later\n1930s it was one of the most striking features of Nyakyusa society, and\n13 Minute 41, meeting of 9-11 November 1950; Minute 52, meeting of 27-30 October\n1952, TNA 157\/L5\/5\/5\/I.\n14 Minute 6, meeting of 23-25 April 1951, and Minute 57, meeting of 17 December 1952,\nTNA 157\/L5\/5\/5\/I.\n15 Book EIII, 31-32, Wilson Notebooks, African Studies Centre, University of Cape Town.\nThis particular chiefs venture into history proved rewarding.

Young men could buy their own cattle and marry now. 19\nChiefs and household heads tussled over the use of state resources,\nparticularly courts, to control the consequences of this new-found\nwealth. The cost of a bride rose rapidly as elder men tried to extract\nwealth from younger migrant labourers (Wilson, 1977: 149, 188), and\ncourts could punish young men for seeking to evade these rising\ncosts by imposing fines for adultery or for running away with a girl. 20 The\nNyakyusa regarded courts as a chiefs key source of authority.21 British\nadministrators, stunned by the popularity of courts, noted that\nthe vast majority of cases concerned adultery, desertion or elopement\n(Hall, 1943) .22\nUntil 1949 chiefs still dominated the courts. Elder men turned to the\nchiefs for help in policing a bridewealth system which served to limit the\neffects of young men's cash earnings, and chiefs were able to use\nconsiderable coercion in this role when they chose. Following one\nparticularly flagrant assault on a woman accused of desertion, a witness\nremarked that 'It is not unusual to see women beaten in native\ncourts. ,23 But elder men frequently complained that chiefs instead used\nthe courts to try and accumulate on their own account, taking runaway\nwomen into their own retinue rather than upholding the claims of\nhousehold heads. 24 Colonial rule provided new resources for the\ncontrol of younger men and women; but control over these resources\nwas contested.\nEconomic change offered household heads opportunities as well as\nchallenges. From the later 1920s foodstuffs could be sold for cash, and\nfrom the 1930s a small number of African men were growing coffee or\ntea for the market. 25 Married men and women became involved in a\n18 Int Nya4c, 3-5.

Wilson observed that women took\nsome of the cash, but an official noted in the 1930s that 'economic\ncrops are mainly the property of married and settled men'. 26 Household\nheads also earned money in less predictable ways, which illustrated the\nability of some to control the economic enterprise of their wives. By the\nearly 1930s beer had already come to be an item of commerce, and in\n1941 more than 1,700 male taxpayers (out of a total of 31,000) derived\ntheir tax money from the selling of beer or malted grain made by their\nwives. 27\nIn dealings with new, colonial, forms of power certain of the former\npractices which had made authority came to be inappropriate. Drinking\nbeer was not deemed suitable for the world of desks and chairs and\nwritten records which came into existence around the courts, so there\nwas an end to the drinking which would once have ensured that all were\nreconciled to the settlement of a case. Missions-Lutheran and\nMoravian-provided their adherents with at least some of the skills of\nreading and writing which officials (and some chiefs) increasingly\nsought when choosing their subalterns. 28 In return these Churches\nexpected their followers to desist from involvement in public non-\nChristian rituals, and from 1927 they discouraged the drinking of beer\n(Mackenzie, 1925: 31).29 In offering new routes to health-which were\ntaken up with apparent enthusiasm by the populace-the petty clinics\nand hospitals of the colonial medical service also sought to discourage\nreliance on former rituals of well-being. 30\nIn consequence, it is evident that public practice of certain rituals\ndeclined and that there was a diminution of the formerly prominent role\nof beer in events which recreated assumptions about the power of elders\nover health. There is clear evidence of changing attitudes to drink and\nauthority in the debate over control of beer selling. For years, chiefs in\nNyakyusa resisted the introduction of 'permits' for the sale of millet\nbeer, apparently because they feared that such official recognition\nwould change the marginal and ambiguous status of beer selling,\nestablishing the propriety of its sale to, and consumption by, young men\nand women. 31 Immediately after the establishment of the new councils\n26 'Labour', Rungwe District Book, TNA library.

The direct consequence of their decision was the rapid spread\nof 'clubs' holding permits.33 These had hitherto been confined to\nTukuyu and Kyela, the two small towns of the area. From the early\n1950s they became a common feature of rural life, and much beer\nconsumption moved from a domestic setting into these new clubs.\nBut even as household heads took up-and fought over-these new\nsources of power, many of them still sought to reproduce the idea that\nthey possessed a special power over the well-being of others. And the\nways they talked about-and drank-beer still played an important part\nin this. Public rituals involving the blowing of beer may have declined,\nbut in the negotiations over marriage, at funerals, and in events\nintended to seek the goodwill of the deceased or the forgiveness of living\nelders, beer still occupied a central position.34 And as the comment\nrecorded by Wilson showed, evocations of a former ideal of drinking\nstressed that, properly, elder men alone should have access to beer.\nSTATE AND ECONOMY SINCE 1961\nWilson identified the Marriage Act of 1971 as a defining moment of the\npost-colonial experience. Giving women new legal rights in marriage\nand divorce, for Wilson the Act was emblematic of the changes in\nrelations of authority which resulted from the new ability of\ntraditionally subordinate groups to access the power of the state in\nsocial conflicts (Wilson, 1977). This new access to power compounded\nthe effects of wage employment and the cash market in beer and other\nitems, further undermining the power of elders. Using the Marriage Act\nas the end of her narrative, Wilson expressed the belief that it\nconfirmed-and made irrevocable-the overall direction of a pattern\nof 'zigzag change'.\nThe post-colonial experience looks rather different when viewed from\nthe end of 2001. The brief efflorescence of the Tanzanian state in the\n1960s and 1970s did indeed create a new public rhetoric of authority\nand rights, abolishing chiefs and introducing an entirely new system of\ncourts (Moore, 1986: 157-61). It also vastly expanded wage employ-\nment and the range of state-sponsored projects which bestowed wealth\nparticularly on the literate and those who possessed the kind of formal\neducation acquired through mission and state schools. Through state-\ncontrolled crop marketing bodies the educated and employed were\n32 Minute 8 of first meeting, n.d.; Minute 32 (vi), meeting of 22-24 October 1952; Minute\n69, meeting of 5-9 October 1953, TNA 157\/L5\/5\/5\/I.\n33 Ints Nya36a, 4; Nya4a, 3; Nya40a, 7.\n34 Wilson Notebook EIII, 103-5; 135; African Studies Centre, University of Cape Town.\n384 NYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s\neffectively subsidised by cultivators; education and employment\nappeared as the key to wealth. Yet even at its height the state became\nentwined with existing forms of authority at the local level, as Moore\nhas shown for Kilimanjaro. Older married men and household heads\ndominated the system of ten-house cells and party organisation, and\nmost cases under the Marriage Act went to informal tribunals, not to\nthe courts (ibid.: 1986: 147-8, 161, 165,213). And in the period of\n'political and economic decay' from the 1980s (Barkan, 1994: 21-35)\nthe ability of individuals to access the wealth or the coercive power of\nthe state declined. Formal wage employment opportunities had already\nbegun to decline in the 1960s, with the effective end of labour migrancy\nto the south. By the 1990s local labour opportunities focused around\ncross-border smuggling, principally of sugar, and a halting liberalisation\nof the food-grain trade and of the marketing of coffee and cocoa (a\nlowland crop established in the 1960s) had created new, if limited,\nopportunities for cultivators. The most effective strategy for accumula-\ntion-or for survival-was to combine access to land and labour with\nsome involvement in petty trade or a craft.\nControl over land has therefore been an important source of\nauthority for elder married men (as Gulliver, 1958: 21-5, noted in\nthe late 1950s), but they struggle to control the time of unmarried sons\nand the sexual activity of their daughters. They struggle too to stop\nyoung men and boys from helping themselves to crops, or from\npractising even more open forms of theft. There is a clear sense of\ngenerational conflict; and in this conflict elder men and the local\nofficials of the state are increasingly in alliance, rather than competition,\neach seeking the other's support. In trying to collect 'development tax',\nin combating theft and in occasional attempts to mobilise communal\ninvolvement or labour in 'development' schemes, the local representa-\ntives of the state turn to elder married men. Over a period of several\nmonths I observed the difficulties of a very senior local official who had\nbought a piece of land but was unable to control the labourers hired to\nwork it, or to stop constant theft of crops. Eventually the official had to\nenlist the support of the most prominent neighbouring homestead head.\nIn theory the official possessed control over the local coercive resources\nof the state-but could not rely on them to enforce property rights or\nlabour contracts. Such is the 'retraditionalisation' of the state, in its\nmost local form (Chabal and Daloz, 1999).\nDRINKING AND AUTHORITY IN THE 1990s\nAs in the pre-colonial period, the authority of elder men rests ultimately\non assumptions about their power over well-being. That such\nassumptions remain widespread is apparent. When one young man\nwas killed in an accident in Tukuyu in 1997 local discussion\nimmediately identified his defiant attitude to his father-culminating\nin a recent public quarrel-as the cause of his death. My research\nassistant readily explained a very serious illness which had befallen him\nas a result of the resentment of an uncle; he had recovered only when\nNYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s 385\nthe uncle was induced to vent the resentment publicly. While grand\npublic ritual events, in which chiefs played a role, have largely\ndisappeared-their demise assured by the hostility of the Christian\ndenominations to which most of the populace belong-there are\nconstant smaller events which evoke and remake assumptions about the\npower of elder men, and the danger posed by their unexpressed\nresentment. The notion of spitting out or venting anger is commonly\nmentioned, and the very terminology of Christian worship maintains\nthis notion. 35\nThe giving and consumption of alcoholic beverages continues to play\nan important part in recreating these assumptions. Since the introduc-\ntion of the rural clubs in the 1950s the bulk of village drinking has taken\nplace in them. In the 1960s, indeed, local officials sought to insist that\nall sales of drink should be confined to the clubs.36 But drink sales are\nnot governed solely by access to cash. Most drinkers are men, and they\ndrink in groups which share the cost of a quantity of beer, which is\nconsumed without any strict regard for the amount each member\ncontributed. Drinking groups are self-selecting, running along lines of\nfriendship and shared appreciation of status. Beneath a commercial\nsurface, such drinking reproduces ideas about generosity and status,\nand about who may drink with whom. There is contest, of course, for\nthat is the nature of drinking events. Sometimes there are more or less\nheated arguments about who may drink in which group, or accusations\nabout the failure of some members of a group to contribute. But the\nrules of drinking are not set simply by ability to pay.\nThe ambiguity about the degree to which beer is 'commoditised' in\nthese events is apparent from the difficulty women sellers frequently\nencounter in extracting payment-a difficulty which makes beer selling\na much less reliable source of income in this area than has been argued\nof neighbouring Iringa (Green, 1999). Credit sale is common, and\ndelayed or refused payment leaves the status of many drinking events\nhanging uneasily between giving and sale. Courts and local officials\nhave been unwilling to get involved in enforcing the commercial nature\nof drinking. 37\nThere are other, explicitly non-coITlmercial, drinking events which\nevoke elder authority. Beer has apparently disappeared from some\nevents but continues to feature in others in a pattern which partly\nreflects the degree to which Christian Churches have captured the\nphysical space of performance. Many older men and women will\nexplain that in the past a bride would always be taken to the groom\nwith beer, to ensure the goodwill of all the families involved. 38 Where a\n35 See Int Nyal2b, 3; also Int Nyal9c, 5, which explicitly link the Nyakyusa notion of\nkwikemesya with Christian confessional practice; the same point is made in Wright, (1971: 91).\n36 Int Nya lOb, 4; Katibu wa T ANU wa Wilaya-all Katibu tarafa and Kata, 16 January\n1976, Rungwe District file L3\/2.\n37 Ints Nyal8b, 4; Nyal9a, 3.\n38 Int Nya20a, 3; Nya39b, 1; Nya17a, 3.\n386 NYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-1990s\nchurch is the central place for a wedding, this no longer occurs. But for\nthose who choose to keep all or most of the wedding events away from\nchurch, the pattern of beer giving, and its association with ensuring the\ngoodwill of the living and the dead, remain explicit.\nIf your daughter is getting married, you prepare beer and pour some for the\nancestors. You prepare beer and food and people come ... If they [unclear\nwhether this means ancestors or neighboursl do not drink they cause\nproblems ... Maybe the children will get sick. 9\nMourning, which is very much a domestic affair, still requires beer.\nBeer makers bring beer to sell, but then it is given and shared.40\nHousehold heads still perform domestic rituals of well-being in which\nbeer is poured; reconciliation between men who have quarrelled still\nrequires beer.41 In seeking forgiveness from a senior, the gift of beer is\nof fundamental importance.\nYou have been cheeky to me: can you be cheeky to me? At once you start to\nsuffer, for you are cursed. When you go to your father to repent, you must\noffer something. When you have given him some money, he calls people ...\nWhen he has made beer he calls people who can help him to remove the\ncurse42 .\nThere is an element of uncertainty over whether this ability to harm\nextends to all younger people, or only to kin. Here there is a hint of a\nnarrowing of the range of elders' power since the nineteenth century.43\nAnd these events are just as contested as are daily drinking: some young\nmen try to avoid paying bride price at all; some refuse to seek\nforgiveness; many will insist that there should be no beer at their\nwedding, for their Christianity forbids it. 44 But others argue for these\nevents, and some go through them, and in remembering the past people\nargue the present. 'Without beer people could not talk properly,'\nexplained one man during mourning. In his view the drinking had\nensured social harmony and well-being, but he added, 'The elders were\nseparated. They would not drink with young people carelessly.,45\nArgument and practice recreate the idea of elder authority over well-\nbeing, making it inhere in everyday existence.\nMostly it is maize beer which is consumed at all these events, in clubs\nand elsewhere.

Now that Tanzania's\nbreweries have been revived, bottled beer is always available in town,\nand occasionally it makes its way into rural clubs. But this is an\nexpensive way to drink-about six times the price of maize beer. And it\nis consumed in rather different ways. Bottled beer tends to be bought by\nindividuals for their own consumption rather than for sharing with a\ngroup. Sometimes bottled beer may feature in marriage payments, for\nexample, but it is not common, and in 1997 a survey of rural drinking\namong the Nyakyusa showed that bottled beer accounted for less than\n0\u00b75 per cent of alcohol consumption.46\nDrinking events, then, may still reproduce a notion of elders'\nauthority. And even when they are not drinking, the way in which elder\nmen in particular talk about drinking is important. There has been a\nsubtle recasting here, too. Some retrospective accounts of drinking\nmake much of the moderation of elders' drinking, a stress on sobriety\nwhich accords well with post-colonial Tanzania's emphasis on hard\nwork and responsibility.47 But the key point is that modem drinking is\ndangerous: 'Nowadays this alcohol has brought about diseases.,48 In a\nhealthier past, elders had exclusive access to beer. 'They are drunkards,\nour young people; it wasn't that way with our parents.' 'Today's beer is\ndifferent . . . We began when we were adults, but these ones, they\nare careless by nature.,49 Youthful disobedience-and ill health-are\nthe consequence of changes in drinking behaviour: 'My children do not\nlike digging, and instead go to drink beer. This makes Reople not care\nabout dying, or working like we did, because of beer.'so The idea of\ndrinking change recorded by Wilson is still common: discourses on the\ndangers of modern drinking serve, in a continuing debate over well-\nbeing, as an explicit assertion of the linkage between respect for elders\nand the well-being of society and individuals.\nCONCLUSION\nAmong the Nyakyusa drinking has changed enormously in the last\ncentury. It now takes place very largely in commercial settings, in which\nwomen and young men have, in theory, considerable access to alcohol.\nBut Wilson's argument that a decline in the authority of 'men and\nelders' was inextricably associated with drinking change is problematic.\nPre-colonial authority and drinking patterns were more contested than\nshe argued; and at the end of the twentieth century-as people in\nTanzania struggle to adjust to the declining wealth and abilities of the\nstate-an assumption of a gendered, generational, power over well-\nbeing, recognisably similar to that manifested by late nineteenth-\n46 Results summarised on the web site at http:\/\/www.dur.ac.uk\/History\/projects.htm\n47 Ints Nyal2b, 5; Nyal7b, 4; Nya20a, 4.\n48 Int Nyal4b, 3.\n49 Ints Nya 19b, 4; Nya8c, I.\n50 Int Nya3b, 6.\n388 NYAKUSA BEER, 1890s-19908\ncentury drinking practice, is being made and remade in daily life, partly\nthrough drinking practice but even more through the creation of a\ndiscursive realm in which beer still properly does belong to elder men.\nNobody champions the propriety ofyouthful drinking of maize or millet\nbeer, and there are many who assert that 'Long ago, old men would\ndrink. Young people never used to drink.,s1 In doing so, they assert also\na relationship between proper drinking, the authority of elders and well-\nbeing, and they denounce a modernity which has called that relation-\nship into question yet has failed to offer any effective alternative route to\nwell-being:\n... life is very hard and complex now.... The beer in the past did not cause\nany harm because education was very little. It was too little to lure people to\ndrunkenness. It was little. Now they mix many drugs into the beer.

That is why many people are getting infected with very\nmany diseases, many infectious diseases which weren't around in the past\n... Nowadays there is a lot of TB and syphilis. Infectious diseases are\ncommon because people are overcrowded. They are so crowded such that we\nno longer have protections and treatments. We do not have the protective\nmedicines, there are just no hospitals. When people are taken you have to\npay for the medicine. So those who are poor, when they go there, they come\nback untreated.

This article\nsuggests that these works took insufficient account of struggles over authority\nin the colonial period. Consequently they overstated the formalisation of chiefly\npower and understated the complex relationship between generational tensions\nand political authority in the pre-colonial period. Following discursive and\npractical changes in the use of alcohol, the article identifies a shift in the nature\nof power among the Nyakyusa over the twentieth century and develops the idea\nthat drinking talk, and drinking practice, are central fields for the creation and\nrecreation of the assumptions of power which underpin authority.\nRESUME\nLes Nyakyusa ont fait l'objet d'une serie classique d'ethnographies. Cet article\nsuggere que ces etudes n'ont pas tenu suffisamment compte des luttes de\npouvoir au cours de la periode coloniale. Elles ont par consequent surestime la\nformalisation du pouvoir des chefs et minimise la relation complexe entre\ntensions generationnelles et autorite politique au cours de la periode\nprecoloniale. A la suite d'une evolution discursive et pratique de la\nconsommation d'alcool, l'article denote un changement dans la nature du\npouvoir chez les Nyakyusa au cours du vingtieme siecle et developpe l'idee\nselon laquelle la discussion accompagnee d'une consommation d'alcool et la\npratique de la consommation d'alcool sont des domaines fondamentaux de\ncreation et recreation des prises du pouvoir qui etayent l'autorite.\n"}
