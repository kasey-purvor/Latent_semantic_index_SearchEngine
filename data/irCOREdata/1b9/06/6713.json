But he was, plainly, overwhelmingly more concerned with his mark in the examination than with the arguments themselves. Any tactic which might lead him to a higher mark was one to be adopted: in the real world, he was clearly less interested in real learning than in any kind of learning which would lead to a high assessment of his performance; and, from his standpoint of future employment, etc., understandably so.

That he might well have really learned but that he had decided to put this real learning behind him at examination time? I doubt it. It seems to me that his attitude betrayed a typical young-student learning experience, focused on gaining high marks and to Hell with self-edification which at best might be a by-product of study. The way out of this problem is, of course, to assess students on real learning. There is less of a literature on that topic.

And in many respects we have. The technology is progressing at a pace which is\nincreasingly difficult to comprehend. The software 'revolution' continues unabated to\nproduce increasingly complex integrated applications. These daunting developments\nincrease the pressure on academics, their institution and inevitably the student. To this we\ncan add the problem of decreasing finance to universities and educational establishments\nin general. We, as practitioners in learning technology, must utilize the best features of\ncommunications and applications to reduce the pressures on ourselves and our colleagues.\nAre we succeeding? What is success? How is it monitored, measured and evaluated?\nTo use the convoluted technology and its associated infrastructure, and to exploit the\nopportunities afforded to us by the Internet and advanced communications, is no mean\nfeat. The papers presented at this year's conference, under the banner Virtual Campus -\nReal Learning, presented some apposite developments in the field of learning. This is the\ncrux of any development. It is very easy to blame the technology, or worse still see the\ntechnology as the goal of the research development process. We need to be mindful of what\nwe as learning technologists are endeavouring to achieve. Is it interaction (something as yet\nnot really achieved on the Internet)? Is it administration? Should we as academics be\nresearching into this area? Is it simply to occupy? As academics can we afford to teach\nstudents on a one-to-one basis?\nWhat am I suggesting is: yes, we have come a long way but there is a long way to go still. In\nfact, arguably as we consider that we have reached the end, the chequered flag has not only\nmoved on but it has probably moved tangentially to where we wanted or felt that it could\ngo. I quote from an article by Richard Hooper published in 1975:\nThe computer [...] displays to the learner another frame of text depending on the\nparticular response the learner has typed in to the questions. Each frame of text is\n3\nEditorial\nselected by the computer to match the performance of the individual under tuition. The\ncomputer is said to be adaptive to the individual learner.\nWe are still striving for this, and now with 'virtuality'. The title of the conference suggested\nan unreal learning world. I can cope with this as long as the learning and its associated\nexperiences are real. The papers at the conference addressed many of the issues of learning\nin a world of communications technology. The conference presented many opportunities\nfor collaborative networking of research and development ideas. For this particular issue\nwe received 52 submissions for publication. Yet again, the referees found it difficult to\nextract the few accepted for this edition. We have increased the number accepted last year\nto 14 this year, and hope that the diversity of approach, interest and development reflects\nwhat is currently happening within our respective institutions. I look forward to ALT-98\nand the connected world.\nJohn O'Donoghue, Chair, ALT-C97\nReference\nHooper, R., and Toye, I.
