We derive uniform approximations for contributions to Gutzwiller\u2019s periodic-orbit\nsum for the spectral density which are valid close to bifurcations of periodic orbits in systems\nwith mixed phase space. There, orbits lie close together and give collective contributions,\nwhile the individual contributions of Gutzwiller\u2019s type would diverge at the bifurcation. New\nresults for the tangent, the period-doubling and the period-tripling bifurcation are given. They\nare obtained by going beyond the local approximation and including higher-order terms in the\nnormal form of the action. The uniform approximations obtained are tested on the kicked top\nand are found to be in excellent agreement with exact quantum results.\n1. Introduction\nSemiclassical approximations, in terms of periodic orbits, belong to the main tools for the\nexamination of spectral properties of quantum systems. They allow us, for example, to\nexplain fluctuations in quantum spectra in terms of the periodic orbits of the corresponding\nclassical system. Semiclassical periodic-orbit approximations have been derived in cases\nwhere the classical dynamics is chaotic or integrable or has more general symmetries [1\u20138].\nIn these systems periodic orbits are typically either isolated or appear in families.\nMost systems, however, are neither chaotic nor integrable but show a complicated\nmixture of regular and chaotic behaviour. In these systems, semiclassical approximations\nare more complicated and to date there do not exist complete semiclassical approximations\nfor quantities such as the spectral density in terms of periodic orbits. These difficulties are\ndue to the fact that in many situations periodic orbits neither appear in families nor can\nthey be treated as being isolated in a semiclassical approximation. This is the case when\nthere are other periodic orbits very near. If the action differences of neighbouring periodic\norbits are not large in comparison with h\u00af then the orbits yield a collective semiclassical\ncontribution, and this is the typical situation when bifurcations of periodic orbits occur. In\norder to extend semiclassical approximations to systems with mixed phase space one has to\nderive expressions for the joint contribution of orbits which participate in a bifurcation. For\ngeneric two-dimensional systems this was first done by de Almeida and Hannay [9]. They\nderived an approximation which was valid in the vicinity of a bifurcation. In this paper we\nextend the results of de Almeida and Hannay and derive analytic formulae which interpolate\nover the regime from a bifurcation up to regions where the orbits can be considered isolated.\nBifurcations are a characteristic phenomenon in systems with mixed phase space. They\nare responsible for the rapid increase of the number of periodic orbits when an integrable\nsystem is transformed into a chaotic system, for example by changing an external parameter.\nIf one changes this parameter by an arbitrarily small but finite amount, then in general an\n0305-4470\/97\/134537+26$19.50 c\u00a9 1997 IOP Publishing Ltd 4537\n4538 H Schomerus and M Sieber\ninfinite number of bifurcations occur, since they take place any time that the stability angle\nof a stable orbit is a rational multiple of 2\u0019 . There are different kinds of generic bifurcations,\nbut the number of different forms is limited. The generic bifurcations that occur in two-\ndimensional conservative systems (or, equivalently, one-dimensional area-preserving maps)\nwere classified by Meyer and Bruno [10\u201312]. They are characterized by normal forms which\ndescribe the characteristic classical motion in the vicinity of a periodic orbit. Altogether\none has to distinguish five different cases. These are the period-m-tupling bifurcations with\nm D 1 up to m D 5. They have the property that a central periodic orbit bifurcates and other\nperiodic orbits split from the central orbit whose primitive period is m times the primitive\nperiod of the central orbit. (An exception is the case m D 1 for which there is no periodic\norbit before the bifurcation.) The cases for m > 5 follow the same pattern as for m D 5.\nBy integrating over the normal forms de Almeida and Hannay derived their\napproximation. Their results are expressed in terms of diffraction catastrophe integrals.\nIn the following we call this approximation the \u2018local approximation\u2019, since it is valid\nin the vicinity of a bifurcation. In farther distance from a bifurcation it reduces to an\napproximation of Gutzwiller\u2019s type for isolated periodic orbits, it does not yield, however,\nthe correct semiclassical amplitudes of the orbits. In [13] the results of de Almeida were\nextended for the case m > 5 by including higher-order terms in the normal forms. A slightly\ngeneralized version of this result is given in [14]. In this paper we derive corrections for the\nlow-order bifurcations with m D 1\u20133. We obtain uniform approximations in closed form\nwhich are valid from a bifurcation up to the regime where Gutzwiller\u2019s approximation can\nbe applied.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the semiclassical\nmethod for treating bifurcations and in section 3 we present the results for the uniform\napproximations in two-dimensional conservative systems that are derived in the appendices.\nIn section 4 we give the corresponding results for one-dimensional area-preserving maps.\nNumerical examinations of the uniform approximations are carried out in section 5 on\nthe example of a kicked top, and in section 6 we discuss the range of validity of our\napproximations and possible extensions.\n2. Contributions to the spectral density\nIn autonomous systems with discrete energy spectra the density of states\nd.E\/ D\nX\nn\n\u000e.E \u2212 En\/ D \u2212 1\n\u0019\nImTrG.E\/ (1)\ncan be expressed in terms of the trace of the (retarded) Green\u2019s function.\nSemiclassical contributions of periodic orbits to the level density are derived from (1) by\ninserting the semiclassical approximation for the Green\u2019s function. In a mixed coordinate-\nmomentum representation this approximation is given for two-dimensional systems by\nG.q0;p; E\/ \u0019 1\nih\u00af\np\n2\u0019 ih\u00af\nX\n\u0018\npjD\u0018 j exp\u001a i\nh\u00af\nOS\u0018 .q0;p; E\/\u2212 i\u00192 O\u0017\u0018\n\u001b\n(2)\nwhere the sum runs over all classical trajectories with initial momentum p and final position\nq0 at energy E. The function OS\u0018 for a trajectory \u0018 is defined as\nOS\u0018 .q0;p; E\/ D\nZ q0\nq\np \u0001 dq C q \u0001 p (3)\nBifurcations of periodic orbits and uniform approximations 4539\nwhere the integral is evaluated along the trajectory \u0018 , and q is the initial position of the\ntrajectory which is determined by the initial momentum p and the final position q0. Its\nvalue follows from the condition that the gradient of the right-hand side of (3) with respect\nto q vanishes. OS.q0;p; E\/ is the generating function for a canonical transformation from\nfinal to initial coordinates of a trajectory. The mixed representation has been chosen since\nfor a bifurcating orbit this transformation is close to the identity which cannot be generated\nin a pure coordinate or momentum representation.\nFinally, D\u0018 is the determinant of a matrix of second derivatives of OS\u0018\nD\u0018 D det\n \n@2 OS\u0018\n@q0@p\n@2 OS\u0018\n@q0@E\n@2 OS\u0018\n@E@p\n@2 OS\u0018\n@E2\n!\n(4)\nand O\u0017\u0018 is an integer related to the Maslov index (see, e.g. [7]).\nThe semiclassical spectral density is then determined by\nd.E\/ D \u2212 1\n\u0019\nIm\nZ\nd2q 0 d2pG.q0;p; E\/ exp\n\u0012\n\u2212 i\nh\u00af\nq0 \u0001 p\n\u0013\n: (5)\nIn the vicinity of a periodic orbit the integrals are evaluated by choosing local coordinates\nwith one coordinate along the orbit and one perpendicular to it. If the integral over\nthe perpendicular direction is evaluated in stationary phase approximation one obtains the\nGutzwiller approximation for the semiclassical contribution of the orbit\nd\u0018 .E\/ D 1\n\u0019h\u00af\nT\u0018\nr\u0018\npjTrM\u0018 \u2212 2j cos\n\u0012\nS\u0018\nh\u00af\n\u2212 \u0019\n2\n\u0017\u0018\n\u0013\n: (6)\nHere S\u0018 is the action of the orbit whose value is given by the function OS\u0018 .q0;p; E\/\u2212q0 \u0001p for\nthe considered periodic orbit. T\u0018 ,M\u0018 and \u0017\u0018 are the period, stability matrix and Maslov index\nof the orbit, respectively. The integer r\u0018 denotes the repetition number of the orbit. In this\nnotation we consider a periodic orbit and its multiple traversals which all give semiclassical\ncontributions to the level density as different periodic orbits. The uniform approximations\nfor bifurcating periodic orbits that are derived in this paper will be expressed in terms of\nexactly the same classical quantities that appear in (6).\nWe now consider the contribution of a bifurcating orbit with repetition number r to\nthe level density. The condition for such a bifurcation is that the stability matrix of\nthe corresponding primitive periodic orbit (repetition number r D 1) satisfies TrM D\n2 cos.2\u0019n=r\/ with integers r and n and thus the stability matrix of the rth traversal has a\ntrace which is equal to two. Let l be the greatest common divisor of r and n. Then the\nbifurcation is a period-m-tupling bifurcation with m D r= l. Near the bifurcation the integral\nover the perpendicular coordinates cannot be evaluated in stationary phase approximation\nsince there are stationary points nearby which correspond to the other orbits participating in\nthe bifurcation. This is reflected by the fact that the Gutzwiller approximation (6) diverges at\nthe bifurcation. Instead, one has to derive a joint contribution of all orbits which are involved\nin the bifurcation. This is achieved by expanding the generating function OS.q0;p; E\/ in\nhigher order around the central orbit. In general this results in a complicated exponent in the\nintegrand of (5). The integrals can be considerably simplified by a canonical transformation\nof the coordinates and by using the fact that the form of equation (5) is semiclassically\ninvariant under canonical transformations. This follows from the work of Miller [15] and\nis discussed by Littlejohn [16].\nThe most simple form that the generating function can take near the bifurcation is\ngiven by the normal form. This normal form contains information about the number and\narrangement of the orbits which are involved in the bifurcation. The transformation to the\n4540 H Schomerus and M Sieber\nnormal form coordinates has the further advantage that the integral over the coordinates\nalong the periodic orbit can be performed trivially.

As will be\nshown in the appendices, the diffraction integrals for these cases can be expressed in terms\nof Bessel functions. The properties of the bifurcations corresponding to these normal forms\nare discussed in more detail in the next section. All these bifurcations involve two periodic\norbits.\nThe approximation of de Almeida and Hannay is valid in the vicinity of a bifurcation\nand hence we called it the local approximation. Further from a bifurcation the local\napproximation splits up asymptotically into a sum of separate contributions of Gutzwiller\u2019s\ntype for the periodic orbits. However, in this limit the semiclassical amplitudes of the orbits\nhave a fixed ratio, i.e. there is a fixed relationship between the stabilities (and periods) of\nthe different orbits. In more detail, the approximation holds when the following relations\nbetween the monodromy matrices and the periods of the orbits are valid.\nm D 1 : TrM1 C TrM2 \u2212 4 D 0 T1 D T2\nm D 2 : TrM1 C 2 TrM0 \u2212 6 D 0 T1 D T0\nm D 3 : TrM1 C 3 TrM0 \u2212 8 D 0 T1 D T0:\n(10)\nFor m D 2 and m D 3 the index 0 denotes the central bifurcating orbit and the index\n1 denotes the satellite orbit. For the case m D 1 there is no central periodic orbit and\nthe two periodic orbits which are involved in the bifurcation are given the indices 1\nand 2. Relations (10) follow from the normal forms and are valid in the vicinity of a\nbifurcation. Further from a bifurcation, however, they are not valid any more, and then the\nlocal approximation becomes inaccurate. In order to obtain a formula which uniformly\ninterpolates over the region from the bifurcation up to regimes where the Gutzwiller\nBifurcations of periodic orbits and uniform approximations 4541\napproximation is valid (without restrictions on the semiclassical amplitudes) one has to\ninclude higher-order corrections to the normal forms in (9). The resulting integrals can then\nbe reduced to simpler forms by appropriate coordinate transformations. These calculations\nare carried out in appendices A\u2013C, and the results are discussed in the next section.\n3. Results for the uniform approximations\n3.1. The isochronuous bifurcation\nThe bifurcation which is described by the normal form in (9) for m D 1 has the following\nproperty: on one side of the bifurcation where \" and a have opposite signs two periodic\norbits exist, one stable and one unstable. We denote these orbits by \u00181 and \u00182. On the other\nside of the bifurcation where \" and a have the same sign both orbits are complex, and we\ngive the index 1 to that orbit for which the imaginary part of the action is positive. Due to\nthe shape of the function OS.q 0; p;E\/\u2212 q 0p this bifurcation is called tangent bifurcation or\nsaddle-node bifurcation.\nThe uniform approximation for the semiclassical contributions of the two orbits is\nderived in appendix A.

Equations (11) and (13) can be written in a combined\nform by expressing them in terms of an Airy function.\nIn the limit \" ! 0 the leading-order semiclassical contribution of equations (11) and\n(13) is given by\nd\u0018 .E\/ D\nT00\n1\n3\n\u0019l\np\n6\u0019h\u00af7=6a1=3\ncos\n\u0012\nS0\nh\u00af\n\u2212 \u0019\n2\n\u0017 \u2212 \u0019\n2\n\u001b\n\u0013\n: (14)\nHere T0 and S0 are, respectively, the period and action of the orbits at the bifurcation, a is\nthe coefficient in the normal form (9), and l is the repetition number of the bifurcating orbits.\nThe contribution (14) is of order h\u00af\u22121=6 larger than the contribution of an isolated period orbit.\nAll appearing classical quantities in (14) depend on the integer l. In detail, T0;l D lT0;lD1,\nS0;l D lS0;lD1, \u0017l D l\u0017lD1 and al D l5=2alD1. The relation for the Maslov index follows from\nthe Maslov index of the unstable orbit in table 1 for multiple traversals. The last relation is\nobtained by noting that all coefficients in the normal form (9) increase by a factor of l as l is\nincreased. However, \u001b is restricted to be \u00061. This is achieved by a subsequent (canonical)\ntransformation p! p=pl and q ! qpl. It follows that the amplitude of the contribution\nat the bifurcation decreases like l\u22125=6 with l. However, this result is only valid as long as\nthe bifurcation can be considered isolated from other bifurcations. Longer periodic orbits\ntend to bifurcate more and more rapidly, for that reason contribution (14) is expected to\nbreak down for large l since the bifurcation cannot then be considered isolated from further\nbifurcations of the participating orbits.\n3.2. The period-doubling bifurcation\nThe period-doubling bifurcation which is described by the normal form in (9) for m D 2\nhas the following form. On one side of the bifurcation where \" and a have the same sign\nthere is only one orbit which is called the central orbit. This orbit changes its stability at the\nbifurcation from stable to unstable or vice versa, and a new orbit appears which is named\nthe satellite orbit since the two fixed points of the Poincare\u00b4 map which belong to this orbit\nlie symmetrically on both sides of the fixed point of the central orbit.

Uniform approximations for maps\nAlthough we concentrated on autonomous systems in the preceding paragraphs, the uniform\ncontributions given there can equally be applied, with minor modifications, to quantum\nmaps. These maps are described by a unitary time-evolution operator F , the so-called\nFloquet operator; the dynamics of the system is generated by repeated applications of\nthe operator on a state in Hilbert space. F has eigenstates and unimodular eigenvalues\ne\u2212i\u2019i , where the phases \u2019i are called quasi-energies and the states quasistationary states\nsince many quantum maps originate from a stroboscopic description of periodically driven\nsystems.

(i) The orbits which\ncontribute are those with a fixed period n, not those with a given energy E; (ii) the primitive\nperiods have to be expressed in units of T and thus are integer valued; (iii) the action is\nnot the reduced energy-dependent one, but depends on time (that is, on the number n);\n(iv) instead of taking twice the real part, the full complex contribution has to be taken; (v)\nthe results further differ by a factor of 2\u0019h\u00af.

Numerical results\nIn this section we want to test the quality of the uniform collective contributions that we\nderived for the various types of bifurcations on a certain quantum map, a periodically kicked\ntop [19\u201321]. It will turn out that the uniform approximations are indeed accurate both close\nto the bifurcation as well as at a distance; the local approximation is only valid close to the\nbifurcation while far away the orbits can be treated as being isolated via the stationary-phase\napproximation.\nTops are dynamical systems that involve the angular-momentum operators Jx , Jy , Jz,\nsatisfying the usual commutation relations [Jk; Jl] D i\u000fklmJm, where h\u00af is set to unity. The\nevolution of the system is such that the total angular momentum J 2x CJ 2y CJ 2z D j .j C1\/ is\nconserved. This introduces the well known good quantum number j which fixes the Hilbert\nspace dimension 2j C 1. j C 12 further plays the role of the inverse of Planck\u2019s constant;\naccordingly, the semiclassical limit is reached by sending j !1.\nThe specific top used here is described by the Floquet operator\nF D exp\n\u0012\n\u2212i kz\n2j C 1J\n2\nz \u2212 ipzJz\n\u0013\nexp.\u2212ipyJy\/ exp\n\u0012\n\u2212i kx\n2j C 1J\n2\nx \u2212 ipxJx\n\u0013\n: (25)\nThe dynamics consists of rotations by angles pi and nonlinear rotations (torsions) of strength\nki . For the study of bifurcations we hold the pi at fixed values (px D 0:3, py D 1:0,\npz D 0:8) and take k D kz as our control parameter, with kx D k=10. The classical\ncounterpart of the system is integrable at k D 0 and displays well developed chaos at k D 5.\nBifurcations of periodic orbits and uniform approximations 4547\n1\n2\naction spectrum\nk=2.0\n1\n2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 S\nk=2.25\n1\n2\naction spectrum\nk=2.5\n1\n2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 S\nk=3.0\nFigure 1.

A ghost peak shows up before the bifurcation at S D 5:3;\nbeyond the bifurcation the peak splits into two, each corresponding to a bifurcating orbit.\nThere is a very convenient testing tool which enables one to examine each contribution\nof a given cluster of periodic orbits individually.

We used\njmin D 1 and jmax D 64 with a single exception for m D 3.\nFrom the asymptotic behaviour (20) of all uniform approximations it is clear that one\nexpects peaks in jT .n\/.S\/j2 at values of the argument which correspond to actions of periodic\norbits. The function jT .n\/.S\/j2 is called the action spectrum for that reason. Figure 1\nconfirms that peaks indeed show up. A sequence of action spectra is plotted for n D 1 as\nthe control parameter, k is varied across a tangent bifurcation at k D 2:45. Already before\nthe pair of orbits comes into existence a peak is visible at S D 5:3. This peak arises from\nthe complex predecessors of the bifurcating orbits that were already observed in [22]. The\nother peaks pertain to different orbits. Slightly beyond the bifurcation the new-born orbits\nhave nearly identical actions and give rise to a single peak that would be resolved if one\nwould go to much higher jmax. Increasing the control parameter further the peak splits into\ntwo peaks which are located at the now well separated values of the orbits\u2019 actions.\nThe quality of our results can now be tested by calculating the height of the peaks\njT .n\/.Scl\/j2 both quantum-mechanically exact as well as on the grounds of the various\nsemiclassical approximations. Figure 2 depicts the height of the aforementioned peaks\nas the control parameter is varied across the tangent bifurcation. In the vicinity of the\nbifurcation both the local, as well as the uniform approximation, are accurate to a degree\nthat makes it difficult to resolve the error at all. The uniform approximation also remains\nvalid as one moves away from the bifurcation. There the sum of individual contributions\nof isolated orbits is seen to gain validity.\nFigure 3 illustrates the superiority of the uniform approximation over the local one away\nfrom the bifurcation. To that end, the exact peak itself is compared with the approximated\n4548 H Schomerus and M Sieber\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n1 2 3 4 5 k\nstable orbit\npeak height\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\n0.01\n0.1\n1\n10\n1 2 3 4 5 k\nunstable orbit\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\nFigure 2.

Both the uniform and the local bifurcations work well\nclose to and on the left of the bifurcation. The local approximation starts to fail as k is increased,\nand the sum of isolated contributions of Gutzwiller\u2019s type becomes valid. Note that the uniform\napproximation remains accurate and can hardly be distinguished from the exact result in this\nplot.\nones. The local approximation assumes that the stabilities of both orbits are equal and gives\ntwo peaks of the same height. With the sum of two isolated terms of Gutzwiller\u2019s type\nboth peak heights are slightly overestimated. The uniform approximation almost coincides\nwith the exact result. Figure 3 thus shows a case where the distance from the bifurcation\nis already so large that the local approximation becomes bad, but not large enough for the\nGutzwiller approximation to become as good as the uniform approximation.\nIn figure 4, the peak heights of orbits participating in a period doubling at k D 4:3 are\nplotted. In this case it is hardly possible to discriminate between the local and the uniform\napproximations. Before the amplitudes start to differ significantly, erratic deviations to the\nexact result are encountered which stem from overlapping peaks of other orbits. One such\norbit has already been included here with its isolated contribution for k > 5:8 and cures\npart of the problem, but other orbits become relevant from k \u0019 6:2. Instead of further\nimproving on this we settle for the information that the approximations work well close to\nthe bifurcation and turn to other period doublings. Figure 5 actually arises from a similar\nsituation of two overlapping peaks; both peaks, however, arise from two pairs of orbits\nwhich undergo period doublings at k D 2:78 and k D 2:84, respectively. It is a pure\ncoincidence that both pairs have almost the same action. Plotted now is the collective\ncontribution of the total number of four orbits in various semiclassical approximations and\nthe exact result. The situation is qualitatively the same as for the tangent bifurcation: both\nBifurcations of periodic orbits and uniform approximations 4549\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n5 5.2 5.4 5.6 5.8\naction spectrum\nS\nk=3.0 exact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\nFigure 3. The exact peak in the action spectrum of figure 1 at k D 3:0 is compared with\nsemiclassically evaluated ones. The uniform approximation works well. The local approximation\npredicts peaks of equal height. Treating both orbits as isolated gives peaks that are slightly too\nhigh.\nthe local and the uniform approximations are excellent close to the bifurcations; moving\naway, the uniform approximation remains valid and the sum of isolated orbits starts to work\nwell while the local approximation breaks down.\nFor period tripling we encounter difficulties from the close neighbourhood of a tangent\nbifurcation of the satellite. This tangent bifurcation was found to be very close to the tripling\nfor all investigated cases. The problem can be overcome if jmin is chosen large enough in\norder to ensure that the further satellite which is involved into the tangent bifurcation\nis well separated, the separation being measured by its difference in action in units of\nPlanck\u2019s constant, .jC 12 \/1S. Then our analytical expression (24), which does not describe\nthe tangent bifurcation, can be tested without being overshadowed by the existence of the\nadditional satellite. Since the relevant action difference is tiny we raised jmin up to 213C 1,\nwith jmax D 213 C 64. The result is presented in figure 6. For the lower values of k the\ntangent bifurcation at k D 3:525 is still felt strongly and all semiclassical approximations\ngo wrong. At the period tripling (k D 3:545) and beyond it the uniform and the local\napproximation work well again. The breakdown of the local approximation is observed if\none goes to a different scale of the control parameter, as shown in figure 7.\nIn conclusion, for all cases studied the uniform approximation was found to give\nexcellent results (as long as the results were not overshadowed by the existence of further\norbits). The local approximation is of the same quality close to the bifurcation. It\nbreaks down when relations (10) between the monodromy matrices become invalid as one\nincreasingly detunes the control parameter. Along the same line, the action difference of\nthe orbits in units of Planck\u2019s constant is large in that region of parameter space, and the\nuse of the sum over isolated orbits (20) makes sense there.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper we examined semiclassical contributions of three different bifurcations in\ntwo-dimensional conservative systems and one-dimensional area-preserving maps. These\nbifurcations are the generic period-m-tupling bifurcations with m D 1, 2 and 3. We extended\nthe local approximation of de Almeida and Hannay for these cases and derived uniform\n4550 H Schomerus and M Sieber\n0.1\n1\n10\n4 5 6 7 k\ncentral orbit\npeak height\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\n0.1\n1\n10\n4 5 6 7 k\nsatellite\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\nFigure 4.

One such orbit has already been included, others not, as is explained in the text.\nThe sum of individual terms that treats all orbits as isolated fails close to the bifurcation and\nregains validity far away.\napproximations which interpolate over the regime from the bifurcation up to regions where\nthe orbits can be considered isolated. The approximations were tested numerically on the\nexample of a kicked top and were found to be in excellent agreement with exact quantum\ncalculations. The local approximation was found to be good near a bifurcation, but its\nquality decreased further from a bifurcation. In contrast, the Gutzwiller approximation is\ngood sufficiently far away from a bifurcation, but it diverges at a bifurcation.\nWe derived the classical properties of periodic orbits that follow from normal forms\nwith higher-order corrections. We further examined the semiclassical contributions of the\norbits directly at the bifurcation (\" D 0). It was found that with increasing m, bifurcations\ncontribute more strongly to the level density. In more detail, the semiclassical amplitude\nof the orbits at the bifurcation is of order O.h\u00af\u22127=6\/ for m D 1, O.h\u00af\u22125=4\/ for m D 2,\nand O.h\u00af\u22124=3\/ for m D 3. For the case m > 5 it follows from [13] that the semiclassical\namplitude at the bifurcation is of order O.h\u00af\u22123=2\/. These results are of the general form\nO.h\u00af\u22121\u2212\u0017\/ where \u0017 is the singularity index corresponding to the considered bifurcation [23].\nThus, bifurcations with larger m have a stronger influence on the level density. In addition,\nfor larger m the semiclassical amplitudes decrease more slowly for higher repetitions of the\nbifurcating periodic orbits. For the lth multiple of the bifurcating orbits the semiclassical\namplitude decreases by a factor of l\u22125=6 for m D 1, by l\u22123=4 for m D 2, by l\u22122=3 for m D 3,\nBifurcations of periodic orbits and uniform approximations 4551\n0.1\n1\n10\n1 2 3 4 k\ncentral orbit\npeak height\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\n0.1\n1\n10\n1 2 3 4 k\nsatellite\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\nFigure 5.

We mention, however, that these results have been obtained by\ntreating the bifurcations isolated from any other bifurcation in the vicinity, an approximation\nwhich is expected to break down for large l.\nIn general, all uniform approximations in this paper are only valid as long as the\nparticipating periodic orbits do not bifurcate further, i.e. as long as the bifurcations can be\nconsidered isolated. If a periodic orbit undergoes several subsequent bifurcations then the\nuniform approximations have to be modified. In general this is the case if contributions\nof longer orbits are considered, because they tend to bifurcate more rapidly. The situation\nthus becomes more and more complex if longer orbits are taken into account. Whether\nneighbouring orbits or neighbouring groups of orbits can be considered isolated depends on\nthe value of the action difference in comparison with h\u00af.\nAn example of a periodic orbit undergoing two subsequent bifurcations was seen in\nsection 5. There a tangent bifurcation occurred very close to a period-tripling bifurcation.\nSimilar situations for period-doubling and period-quadrupling bifurcations have been\nobserved in [24, 17]. In these cases the uniform approximation has to be modified by\nfully integrating over an extended normal form in which higher-order terms are included\nthat describe also subsequent bifurcations. This means that the reduction of the higher-\norder corrections in the exponent of the oscillatory integral (7), as done in appendices A\u2013C,\ncannot be performed in these cases. Instead, the higher-order corrections have to be left in\n4552 H Schomerus and M Sieber\n100\n1000\n10000\n3.54 3.56 3.58 k\npeak height\nexact\nisolated\nlocal\nuniform\nFigure 6.

For the mentioned period-tripling bifurcation this was done in [25].\nAn extension of the present results concerns the case m D 4, i.e. the period-quadrupling\nbifurcation. Since the casem > 4 was treated in [13] this is the only remaining generic bifur-\ncation. The treatment of the generic period-quadrupling bifurcation is more complicated than\nthe other cases since it involves three periodic orbits whose action differences all scale with\nthe same leading power in \" (for small \"). As a consequence one has to add two correction\nterms to the local approximation in order to obtain a formula which has the correct Gutzwiller\nlimit. Furthermore, the diffraction catastrophe integral for this case can in general not be\nexpressed in terms of simple functions. A treatment of this bifurcation is in preparation.\nBifurcations of periodic orbits and uniform approximations 4553\nA further extension concerns systems with symmetries. In these systems there can be\nfurther kinds of bifurcations which are characteristic for the considered symmetry. Normal\nforms for systems with symmetries have been derived in [26, 27]. If these normal forms\nagree with normal forms for generic bifurcations, then they can be described, with only\nslight modifications, by the same uniform approximations. For example, in systems with\ntime-reversal and reflection symmetries there can be isochronuous pitchfork bifurcations\n[27]. These bifurcations are described by formula (15) for period-doubling bifurcations\nwith the replacement of A1 by 2A1. Another example where the generic formula for m > 5\nis applied to symmetric period-n-tupling bifurcations with n D m=2 is discussed in [14].\nAcknowledgments\nMS would like to thank A Mouchet for helpful discussions, and wishes to\nacknowledge financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft under\ncontract no DFG-Ste 241\/7-1 and \/6-1.

The step to obtain the uniform approximation consisted of expressing the coefficients of\nthe normal forms in these equations by the classical actions and amplitudes of the orbits.\nThis resulted in equations (39) and (41), which have the correct asymptotic form as \u000eS=h\u00af,\nbecoming large. These approximations thus have the properties of uniform approximations,\nthey are valid close to the bifurcation as well as far away from it. From another point of\nview, they are valid in both limits h\u00af ! 0 as well as \" ! 0. One might ask what would\nhappen if one added even more corrections to the normal form (27). After a modification of\ntransformation (35) this leads to higher powers of x in the exponential prefactor in integral\n(37). This results in higher derivatives of the Airy function which can be expressed by\nthe Airy function and its first derivative (by using the differential equation for the Airy\nfunction). After expressing the coefficients by the classical actions and amplitudes, one\nobtains exactly the same equations (39) and (41) since the coefficients of the Airy functions\nare fixed by the asymptotic form of the equations for large \u000eS=h\u00af. The only difference in\ncomparison with the previous derivation is that the expansions of the classical actions and\namplitudes are carried out in higher order.\nAppendix B.

The integrals leading to (72) after a substitution x D I 3=2 can be found in\n[31]. From (72) to (73) the limit \" ! 0 has been performed and the duplication formula\nof the gamma function has been used. From (73) to (74) the sum has been split into three\nparts (by taking every third term, respectively) where the third part vanished. Furthermore,\nthe recurrence formula and the triplication formula of the gamma function have been used.\nFrom (74) to (75) the definition of Kummer\u2019s function 1F1 has been used, and from (75) to\n(76) the formula exp.iz\/J\u0017.z\/ D .z=2\/\u0017 1F1.\u0017 C 12 I 2\u0017 C 1I 2iz\/=0.\u0017 C 1\/ was used [32].\nThe corresponding expression for negative values of z follows from the evenness and\noddness of the real and imaginary part of the integral, respectively.
