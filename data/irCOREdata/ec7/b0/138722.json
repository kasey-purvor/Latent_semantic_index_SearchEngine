This paper describes the methodology developed22\nand the results obtained in a study aimed at estimating organic carbon contents (%) in23\ntopsoils across Europe. The information presented in map form provides policy makers24\nwith estimates of current topsoil organic carbon contents for developing strategies for soil25\nprotection at regional level. Such baseline data is also of importance in global change26\nmodelling and may be used to estimate regional differences in soil organic carbon (SOC)27\nstocks and projected changes therein, as required for example under the Kyoto Protocol to28\nUNFCCC, after having taken into account regional differences in bulk density.29\nThe study uses a novel approach combining a rule-based system with detailed30\nthematic spatial data layers to arrive at a much-improved result over either method, using31\nadvanced methods for spatial data processing. The rule-based system is provided by the32\npedo-transfer rules, which were developed for use with the European Soil Database. The33\nstrong effects of vegetation and land use on SOC have been taken into account in the34\ncalculations, and the influence of temperature on organic carbon contents has been35\nconsidered in the form of a heuristic function. Processing of all thematic data was36\nperformed on harmonized spatial data layers in raster format with a 1km x 1km grid37\nspacing. This resolution is regarded as appropriate for planning effective soil protection38\nmeasures at the European level. The approach is thought to be transferable to other regions39\nof the world that are facing similar questions, provided adequate data are available for40\nthese regions. However, there will always be an element of uncertainty in estimating or41\ndetermining the spatial distribution of organic carbon contents of soils.42\n43\n3Introduction44\nFollowing the unprecedented expansion and intensification of agriculture during the 20th45\ncentury, there is clear evidence of a decline in the organic carbon (OC) contents in many46\nsoils as a consequence (Sleutel et al., 2003). This decline in OC contents has important47\nimplications for agricultural production systems, because OC is a major component of soil48\norganic matter (OM). OM is an important \u2018building block\u2019 for soil structure and for the49\nformation of stable aggregates (Waters & Oades, 1991, Beare et al., 1994). The benefits of50\nOM are linked closely to the fact that it acts as a storehouse for nutrients, is a source of soil51\nfertility and contributes to soil aeration, thereby reducing soil compaction. Other benefits52\nare related to the improvement of infiltration rates and the increase in storage capacity for53\nwater. Furthermore, OM serves as a buffer against rapid changes in soil reaction (pH) and54\nit acts as an energy source for soil micro-organisms. Moreover, soil OM might be55\nsequestered by vegetation and soils, as a possible way of mitigating some detrimental56\neffects of Global Change. These circumstances have heightened the interest in quantifying57\nthe OC contents of soils at regional as well as global level. The official Communication58\n\u2018Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection\u2019 (EC, 2002), adopted in April 2002, is an59\nadditional stimulus to studying the geographical distribution of soil OC. The60\nCommunication identifies eight main threats to soil, of which declining OM is considered61\none of the most serious, especially in southern Europe.62\nThere have been several attempts to estimate carbon stocks at regional level in63\nEurope (Howard et al., 1995; Batjes, 1996; Smith et al., 2000a, b; Arrouays et al., 2001).64\nEstimates of organic carbon stock at national level were established, for example for the65\nUK by Howard et al. (1995) for land under arable agriculture using OC measurements66\nmade during the National Soil Inventories in England & Wales and Scotland (1979-83).67\nSmith et al. (2000b) revised the estimates of Howard et al. (1995) for the UK using data68\n4compiled by Batjes (1996) and a relationship that assumes a quadratic decline in soil OC69\ncontents with depth. Arrouays et al. (2001) calculated OC stocks in the soils of France70\nusing the CORINE land cover database, the 1:1,000,000 scale soil geographical database of71\nFrance and a geographical database containing OC measurements. Lettens et al. (2004)72\nused soil OC data collected during 1950-70 from more than 30,000 soil profiles excavated73\nduring the soil survey of Belgium. Despite the size of the sampled data, all these studies74\nhave the potential problem of assigning point measurements of OC to polygons75\nrepresenting large areas of land with no additional validation of the OC values assigned.76\nFurthermore, they do not provide a basis for estimating OC of soils at the European level,77\nwhich is accurate enough for policy support.78\nIn contrast to this study, the primary aim of these investigations was to estimate the79\ncarbon sequestration potential of soils in global change research: For example, Batjes80\n(1996, 2002) used the WISE database and calculated OC contents for the major soil groups81\nfor the purpose of estimating stocks. However, similar to our study, Batjes (1997)82\nestimated OC contents (%) for FAO Reference Soil Groups and, in an attempt to guide83\npolicy makers at European level, Rusco et al. (2001) estimated OC in topsoils by applying84\na pedo-transfer rule (PTR21) to the data stored in the European Soil Database.85\n86\nMethodology87\nThe objective of this study was to produce a continuous pan-European cover of quantitative88\nOC content in the topsoil, taken as 0-30cm depth. An extrapolation procedure based on89\nsample data was deemed unsuitable for the task. The main reason for developing an90\nalternative method to point-data extrapolation was that, although OC contents have been91\nmeasured systematically in some countries, for example UK, Denmark, The Netherlands92\nand Slovakia, or non-systematically though comprehensively, for example in Belgium,93\n5France, Hungary and Italy, the number of samples analysed at the European level is still94\ninsufficient to generate an accurate spatial distribution at the required scale. Furthermore,95\nthe sample data from national field surveys are regrettably either insufficiently geo-96\nreferenced or not accessible outside the country of origin. Another important reason for97\ndeveloping an alternative method to extrapolating from point data stems from the well-98\nknown fact that OC contents can vary within pedologically defined soil units, depending on99\nvegetation and land management. This is clear from the data computed by Batjes (1996,100\n1997), who determined a coefficient of variation (CV) in topsoil OC contents of between101\n50 and 150% for the same pedological (Reference) soil group. This tendency for large102\nvariation in OC contents increases the difficulty of accurately estimating OC stocks in103\nsoils.104\nTo overcome the limitations in data availability and intrinsic variability in soil105\nproperties, this study developed a distinct procedure, which centres on the processing of a106\nstructured series of conditions for defining topsoil OC in a Geographic Information System107\n(GIS). The principal modules of the procedure are depicted in form of a flow chart in108\nFigure 1.109\nThe main data source for the study is the European Soil Database (ESDB), which110\noriginates from national soil surveys, following harmonization to provide a seamless111\nspatial and thematic cover of European soil properties (King et al., 1994). The ESDB112\nconsists of two main databases, the Soil Geographic Database (SGDB) and the Pedo-113\nTransfer Rules Database (PTRDB) - see Daroussin & King (1997). Both databases were114\nused to produce a European Raster Database, which contains a selected number of thematic115\nsoil properties as spatial data layers in raster format (Hiederer et al., In press).116\nThe PTRDB includes a set of conditions for defining topsoil OC, which are117\narranged in the pedo-transfer rule No. 21 (PTR 21). This rule has been revised and118\n6translated into processing commands, which operate directly on spatial data layers in a119\nGeographic Information System (GIS). The spatial layer was combined with spatial data120\nlayers from the raster database (for soil properties), a European Land Cover layer (for land121\nuse) and a temperature layer (for OC temperature correction). All input data were122\nprocessed to produce topsoil OC content layers on a 10-year basis, ranging from 1900 to123\n1990. The data layer for the decade 1980 to 1989 forms the baseline for calculating topsoil124\ncarbon stocks in European soils, since it relates most closely to 1990, the baseline chosen125\nfor the Kyoto Protocol. Verification of the final OC estimates obtained from the processing126\nchain was performed by comparing the modelled data with measured values from over127\n12 000 ground samples, which were available to the study from soil surveys conducted in128\nthe UK (England and Wales) and Italy.129\n130\nData Sources131\nSoil: European Soil Database132\nThe European Soil Database v.1.0 (Heineke et al., 1998) has been constructed from source133\nmaterial prepared and published at a scale of 1:1 000 000 (CEC, 1985). The resulting soil134\ndata have been harmonised for the whole area covered, according to a standard135\ninternational classification (FAO-UNESCO, 1974; FAO-UNESCO-ISRIC, 1990), together136\nwith analytical data for standard profiles (Madsen and Jones, 1995). The spatial component137\nof this database comprises polygons, which define Soil Mapping Units (SMUs). These138\nspatial elements can be linked to soil attributes, which are referred to as Soil Typological139\nUnits (STUs) and stored in a thematic database. Although each STU is unambiguously140\ndefined, an SMU may comprise up to 10 STUs. The spatial location of STUs within an141\nSMU is not known, only the proportion of each STU in the SMU. Hence, a soil property142\ncan only be diffusely mapped at the resolution of the SMU. While this structure of the143\n7European Soil Database allows relatively efficient data storage, it is not particularly well-144\nsuited for spatial analysis or for combining external information. Therefore, a set of145\nattributes in raster format, which were generated from combining SMUs with all linked146\nSTUs, was used in the study (Hiederer et al., In press).147\n148\nLand Use\/Cover: European Land Cover Data149\nThe land use data utilized in the study were taken from the European Land Cover Data150\nlayer of the Catchment Information System (CIS) (Hiederer, 2001). The layer covers151\nEurope with information according to the CORINE Land Cover (LC) classification codes.152\nThe layer was generated by combining specifically adjusted data from the CORINE LC153\nraster dataset combined with data from the Eurasia land cover data derived from the US154\nGeological Survey (USGS) (United States Geological Survey, 2003). To achieve155\ncomparable thematic coverage between the data sets, a series of cross-classifications was156\ncarried out, in which various USGS data layers were re-assigned or merged. The final layer157\ncorresponds to CORINE level 3 classification codes and is spatially fully compatible with158\nthe layers of the CIS. For use in the pedo-transfer rule for OC, the European Land Cover159\ndata were then re-classed to the four land use types used in the original PTR21 in the160\ninterest of simplicity.161\n162\nClimate: GHCN163\nAn original spatial layer was generated comprising Average Annual Accumulated164\nTemperature (AAAT), expressed in day degrees Celsius (day degrees C). The layer data are165\nbased on meteorological data from the Global Historical Climatology Network - GHCN166\n(Easterling et al., 1996). Spatial layers were derived from the point data through a167\nweighted-distance interpolation. The influence of station altitude on temperature168\nobservations was adjusted for by applying an adapted moist adiabatic lapse rate. The169\n8AAAT spatial layers were calculated using average monthly temperatures from 1890 to170\n1990. The AAAT layer for the decade 1970 to 1979 was used to calculate the OC_TOP171\nvalidation layer because this period covers the decade prior to the ground sampling. The172\ninfluence of moisture on OC was not specifically modelled though this soil-forming factor173\nis implicitly taken into account in the soil type. For example, a Gleysol by definition is a174\nsoil that shows evidence of water logging within 50cm of the surface.175\n176\nVerification: Soil Data from Ground Surveys177\nData from national soil surveys were available for the UK (England and Wales) and Italy,178\nthus covering a wide range of European soils and climatic conditions.179\nEngland & Wales. Measured OC data from England & Wales were available from ground180\nsamples taken during the National Soil Inventory (NSI) in the period 1979-1983 (McGrath181\n& Loveland, 1992). OC was determined by a widely used wet dichromate acid digestion182\nmethod (Avery & Bascomb, 1982). The sampling procedure was a systematic scheme,183\nusing a 5km x 5km grid (McGrath & Loveland, 1992). Sample sites include all land cover184\ntypes, with the exception of some built-up areas, and the data exist for >5500 points. The185\nsystematic nature of the ground samples allows comparison of modelled estimates with186\nmeasured data over a wide range of soil types, environmental conditions and OC values.187\n188\nItaly. The measured OC data for Italy were derived from a monitoring network on189\nagricultural land. The 6779 sample locations are strongly clustered in some areas and it is190\npossible that a plot sampled contained grassland as well as arable crops. The data used in191\nthis study were compiled by Rusco (In prep.) and analysed by a method similar to that used192\nin England & Wales. The sampling scheme, and the limitations imposed by the location of193\nsample sites, render the Italian ground data unsuitable for the compilation of general194\n9statistics for administrative units. However, the data can be used to verify OC estimates for195\nsouthern European conditions on agricultural land.196\n197\nPedo-Transfer Rules198\nA Pedo-transfer Rule (PTR) forms the basis for calculating OC in the methodology199\ndeveloped during this study (PTR21). The system of PTRs present in the European Soil200\nDatabase was developed by Van Ranst et al. (1995) to extend the range of soil parameters201\nnot normally observed or measured during soil surveys, but can be inferred from a202\ncombination of soil properties commonly measured or observed. The principal parameters203\ndefining a property and the representative value for that property are identified through204\nexpert knowledge (Jones & Hollis, 1996). The PTRDB consists of 34 PTRs (Daroussin &205\nKing, 1997), each producing values of a single soil parameter as its output. The output206\nvalues of the parameter are defined through a sequence of conditions, representing, in a207\nstructured form, the typical situations found in the field survey data. The conditions use a208\nvariety of related environmental parameters. They are applied sequentially, starting from209\ngeneral situations and proceeding to more specific situations. As a consequence, the order210\nin which the conditions are applied is part of the rule.211\nThe common form of using such rules is to apply them to each STU in the212\nEuropean Soil Database to generate a new attribute by STU. This study implements the213\nPTR concept using a different methodology. Firstly, the PTR is not applied to tabulated214\ndata, but calculations are performed on spatial data layers directly. Secondly, external data215\nare used for land use and temperature in place of data for these parameters originally stored216\nin the European Soil Database. Furthermore, the influence of temperature on OC content217\nhas been removed as a parameter from the revised rule and is now calculated using a218\nmathematical function.219\n10\nTopsoil OC content defined by PTR 21 uses six input parameters and comprises220\n150 conditions (Van Ranst et al. 1995). The input parameters (see Table 1) are (1) the first221\ncharacter in the FAO code (item SOIL in the database), (2) the second character in item222\nSOIL, (3) the third character in item SOIL, (4) the dominant surface textural class (TEXT),223\n(5) the land use class (USE) and (6) the accumulated temperature class (ATC) of the224\nEuropean Soil Database .225\nThe first step in using the PTR 21 as a basis for estimating topsoil OC was to226\nanalyse the existing conditions and to remove any ambiguity in the sequence of application.227\nFollowing the absence of any conditions differentiating soils with OC content in excess of228\n6%, the next modification was to define two new OC_TOP classes, one for soils with 18 to229\n30% OC (very high) and a second for soils >30% OC (extremely high).230\nNext, values for the USE parameter of the soil database were substituted by those231\nfrom the European Land Cover data layer. The substitution of the information does not232\naffect the conditions of the PTR, but greatly transforms the method of data processing from233\ncomputing records in a table to analysing individual pixels of the spatial layer.234\nThe ATC parameter was removed completely from the conditions. This was235\nconsidered necessary, because the class definitions are rather coarse and version 1.0 of the236\nsoil database contains only the class \u2018medium\u2019. Thus, any condition using ATC as a237\ndefining parameter was effectively ignored in previous applications of PTR 21. In total,238\n112 modifications were made to the previous rule and 24 new conditions were added. The239\nremoval of the ATC parameter from the revised rule requires subsequent processing to240\naccount for the influence of temperature (see below).241\nThe revised PTR for OC_TOP has 5 input parameters and comprises 140242\nconditions, an extract being given in Table 1, which can be translated into programming243\ncode as follows:244\n11\n245\n:246\n17 IF (SN1=L) AND (SN2=c) AND (TEXT=2) AND (USE=C) THEN LET OC_TOP=L247\n18 \uf0c4 IF (SN1=L) AND (SN2=c) AND (TEXT=2) AND (USE=MG) THEN LET OC_TOP=M248\n:249\n68 IF (SN1=G) AND (SN2=f) AND (SN3=m) AND (TEXT=2) AND (USE=SN) THEN LET OC_TOP=H250\n69 \uf0c4 IF (SN1=G) AND (SN2=f) AND (SN3=m) AND (TEXT=3) AND (USE=SN) THEN LET OC_TOP=H251\n:252\n77 IF (SN1=J) AND (SN3=g) THEN LET OC_TOP=M253\n78 \uf0c4 IF (SN1=J) AND (SN3=g) AND (TEXT=4) AND (USE=SN) THEN LET OC_TOP=H254\n:255\n256\nConditions 17 and 18 of the revised PTR define class values for OC_TOP for257\nChromic Luvisols (Lc) with texture class 2 (18% < clay < 35% and sand > 15%, or clay <258\n18% and 15% < sand < 65%). For such soil under cultivation (USE = C), an OC_TOP class259\n= \u2018L\u2019 (1 - 2% OC content) is assigned (Condition 17). Where the soil is under managed260\ngrassland, an OC_TOP class =\u2018M\u2019 (2-6% OC content) is assigned instead (Condition 18).261\nConditions 68 and 69 are examples of conditions added to the original PTR. They apply to262\nMolli-fluvic Gleysols with medium (TEXT = 2) or medium fine (TEXT = 3) texture under263\nsemi-natural vegetation (USE = SN). In both cases the OC_TOP class \u2018H\u2019 (6-18% OC264\ncontent) is assigned. The conditions were added to the rule, because the situation was265\ntypical and not sufficiently defined in the original PTR. In contrast to the previous266\nconditions, Conditions 77 and 78 are examples of defining OC_TOP going from general to267\nmore specific situations and the order of the rule is crucial to the correct functioning of the268\nPTR. In Condition 77, any Gleyic Fluvisols are set to medium OC_TOP content. However,269\nwhen such soils have a fine texture (TEXT = 4) and when land cover is semi-natural270\n(USE = SN), the areas concerned are classified as = class \u2018H\u2019 (6 - 18% OC content).271\n272\nTemperature Effect273\nThe exclusion of the influence of temperature on OC_TOP in the revised PTR necessitated274\ngenerating adequate information on temperature across the area of interest followed by275\ndeveloping a method to include the data in the evaluation outside the PTR. The first task276\nwas accomplished by creating the AAAT data layers. The second task was achieved by277\n12\nsubstituting the rule-based method with a mathematical function to account for the278\ninfluence of temperature on OC_TOP. The function was developed in accordance with the279\nestablished principle that, within belts of uniform moisture conditions and comparable280\nvegetation, the average total OM and nitrogen in soils increase by two to three times for281\neach 10 degrees C fall in mean temperature (Buckman & Brady, 1960, p.152). This is only282\na very general relationship, but it was thought to be suitable for this pan-European study.283\nBased on this relationship and considerations for mathematically permissible minimum and284\nmaximum values, a sigmoidal function of type y=a\u00b7cos(x)n was defined to relate changes in285\ntemperature with changes in OC content. The definition of the function parameters was286\nlater improved by using data from the ground surveys. The function is graphically287\npresented in Figure 2.288\nFigure 2 shows the average ratio of the OC values of the ground data to the output289\nof the revised PTR (OC_TOPPTR) for 175 aggregated units. The aggregation was290\nperformed, because a display of all 12 275 ratio values produces little discernible291\ninformation on the form of the relationship and the aggregated values allow a better visual292\ninterpretation of the relationship between AAAT and the temperature correction293\ncoefficient. Values were aggregated according to land use, FAO soil subgroup and294\ntemperature.295\nTo reduce the influence of isolated values on the graphical representation, only296\nthose data points, which were defined by more than nine values, are displayed on the297\ngraph,. Applying this threshold procedure resulted in 175 aggregated ratio values (managed298\ngrassland: 33, semi-natural: 28, cultivated: 103, no information: 11) depicted in Figure 2.299\nThe most obvious outlier in the graph is a value for TEMPcor of 2.25 and a value for300\nAAAT of 5800 day degrees C. The point represents a site in Italy, where the ground301\nsamples are classified as Chromic Vertisols. Yet the sampled value for OC_TOP averages302\n13\n31%. Such a large amount of OC precludes defining this soil as a Vertisol and thus, for303\nverification purposes, this data point was excluded.304\nThe parameters of the function for TEMPcor are defined in equation 1:305\n306\n\uf028 \uf029 7.010.11024.4cos1.1 44 \uf02b\uf02d\uf0b4\uf0b4\uf03d \uf02d AAATTEMPcor (1)307\n308\nThe equation is applicable within the range of 2200 to 6000 day degrees C. Below and309\nabove this range, constant values were used for TEMPcor. Estimates of OC_TOP derived310\nfrom the model (OC_TOPMOD) were calculated by multiplying the OC_TOPPTR value layer311\nwith the temperature coefficient layer in the GIS.312\nThe parameters set TEMPcor = 1.0 at 4300 day degrees C, i.e. the OC values output313\nby the revised PTR for soil and land use remain unchanged at that temperature. Such314\nAAAT values occur, for example, in southern England, northern France and southern315\nGermany. From approximately 6000 day degrees C upwards a minimum value for TEMPcor316\nof 0.7 is used. Areas with these high temperatures are mainly found in southern Europe.317\nThe TEMPcor value of 0.7 was determined by the ground data from Italy alone, where318\nsamples were restricted to cultivated land. The maximum value for TEMPcor was set to 1.8319\nand kept constant for AAAT values of 2200 or less. Areas with AAAT in this range are in320\nnorthern Europe and in Alpine regions. On the basis of the aggregated mean AAAT in321\nareas below 1800 day degrees C, one could assume a decrease in TEMPcor with decreasing322\ntemperature. However, the number of ground data located in such areas was limited to 32323\ndata points of which 9 were located in areas of <1200 day degrees C. Except for one324\nsample all data stem from the Italian survey. Since it would be unusual to have land325\ncultivated under those temperature ranges and the number of samples is relatively low it326\n14\nwas decided to exclude these data and to keep the value of TEMPcor constant for areas with327\nAAAT values below 1800 day degrees C.328\nThe maximum value of 1.8 for the temperature coefficient derived from the ground329\ndata ties in with the procedure for estimating OM content from OC_TOP. The maximum330\nestimated OC_TOP content after applying the function was approximately 60%. Thus331\nassuming a relatively stable OC:OM ratio of 1:1.72, the maximum value for estimated OM332\ncontent is thus 100%. For the purpose of taking temperature into account for estimating333\nOC_TOP from the revised PTR, no specific distinction by land use was made. The334\ndistribution of the ratio values depicted in Figure 2 would suggest a coefficient, which335\ncould vary by land use and possibly with region. Unfortunately, there is little overlap in the336\ntemperature ranges of the areas for which ground data were available to the study. Data337\nfrom soil samples, including land use other than agriculture, would be required to338\ndetermine different relationships. This could not be done in the scope of the study, but339\nshould be envisaged as a future investigation.340\n341\nProcessing Environment342\nAll processing was performed using spatial data layers, including the SOIL parameter. The343\nrules were converted into processing code of the GIS package used and applied to the344\nspatial data layers. All data \u2013 soil, texture, land cover and climate \u2013 were compiled as345\nstandard 1km x 1km raster data sets for processing as spatial layers conforming to a346\nLambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection of the CIS. The projection parameters and the347\nspatial frame are in accordance with the Eurostat GISCO database. All data processing was348\nperformed in the spatial domain using IDRISI 32 Release 2.349\n350\n15\nResults351\nThe estimated OC contents in the surface horizon of soils in Europe, produced by applying352\nthe revised PTRs and temperature function to 1km spatial data layers of soil, climate and353\nland cover, are shown in Figure 3. For display purposes the data layer of continuous values354\nwas grouped into seven classes (Jones et al., 2004a,b). The estimates cover an area of355\n4 947 079 km2 and includes the following countries: Andorra, Albania, Austria, Bosnia and356\nHerzegovina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Estonia, Spain,357\nFinland, France, Greece, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lichtenstein, Lithuania,358\nLuxembourg, Latvia, Monaco, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, The359\nNetherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovak360\nRepublic, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.361\n362\nVerification363\nTo verify the calculated OC values in the surface horizon of European soils, the data were364\ncompared with measured OC data from sampling surveys on the ground in the UK365\n(England and Wales) and Italy. The verification was performed for two different types of366\nreference items: (1) soil-related reference items, i.e. ground and model data are compared367\nfollowing aggregation at the level of FAO soil subgroup codes and SMU units; (2) soil-368\nindependent spatial items, i.e. ground and model data are compared following aggregation369\nbased on catchments and NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) as used370\nby Eurostat. The use of the reference items required the aggregation of the data into371\ncomparable units.372\n373\nAggregation Units374\n1) FAO soil subgroup codes: The use of the FAO soil subgroup code as the aggregating375\nunit allows an evaluation of differences between modelled and measured values using376\n16\nparameters that are also included in the PTR. This permits, to some degree, an assessment377\nof the correctness of a condition within the PTR and can thus serve as a feedback to378\naddress any shortcomings in the existing rule-based system.379\nBecause of the construction of the soil database (1:n SMU-STU relationship), it is380\nnot possible to generate a definite unambiguous assignment of OC_TOP values to specific381\nsoil types. Therefore, the soil type of the dominant STU in an SMU was used as382\nrepresenting the area. For England and Wales, there are 32 different subgroup codes for the383\ndominant soils stored in the database, whereas the Italian ground data covers 22 different384\nsubgroup codes.385\n386\n2) Soil Mapping Units: SMUs are the actual spatial units in the geographical component of387\nthe European Soil Database. England and Wales are covered by 75 SMUs, of which four388\ndo not contain any ground sample points because of their small extent. For Italy, it was not389\npossible to calculate a meaningful OC value by SMU, because the data collection was390\nconcentrated on agricultural land.391\n392\n3) Catchment Layer: The catchments used in the study were the primary data layer of the393\nCatchment-based Information System (CIS) of the Joint Research Centre (Hiederer & de394\nRoo, 2003). For England and Wales, 159 catchments are defined in the primary layer of the395\nCIS and range in size from 1km2 to 10 969km2. The size of the spatial units is of396\nimportance, because small units have few or even no ground survey points. Therefore, the397\nstudy concentrated on primary catchments larger than 1000km2.398\n399\n4) Administrative Layer: The aggregation to NUTS spatial units is directed at the400\nimplementation of environmental policies, such as protection measures, which are401\n17\ngenerally implemented across administrative regions. The administrative units used to402\naggregate the OC data are those of NUTS Level 2. For England and Wales, a total of 32403\nunits is defined at this level, ranging from 322km2 (Inner London) to 13 122km2 (West404\nWales and The Valleys) in the GIS layer.405\n406\nGround vs. Modelled Data407\nThe average OC_TOP content in the ground data was calculated using the arithmetic mean408\nof the observed values of all points within a spatial unit. For the ground sample data, 95%409\nconfidence levels (CI95) were calculated, as these allow an approximation of the range of410\nvalues of topsoil OC content that can be expected for a given soil type in the field. Ground411\ndata were compared with modelled data separately by region and by land use category. The412\nanalysis used only ground data for which modelled data could be calculated. In Italy, only413\ndata from ground sample points in cultivated land were included, whereas for England and414\nWales all observations were used.415\n416\n1) England & Wales - Ground Data vs. Modelled Data by FAO soil subgroup and SMU:417\nFigure 4 provides a graphical representation of the ground data CI95 for OC content and the418\nmean value obtained from the model in England and Wales by FAO soil subgroup. A total419\nof 5 289 points was used in the aggregation and the number of observations per FAO soil420\nsubgroup ranges from 5 for Calcaric Regosols (Rc) to 654 for Stagno-gleyic Luvisols (Lgs).421\nThere is generally an extremely close relationship between the average OC_TOP content of422\nthe ground and modelled data. From analysing all land cover classes, it is clear that the423\nmodel overestimates OC content in the topsoil for Histosols (organic soils): Dystric424\nHistosols (Od) produced a mean topsoil OC content of 36.4% for ground data vs. 45.5%425\n18\nfor model data. For the subgroup Eutric Histosols (Oe), the mean OC content was426\ncalculated as 14.8% for ground data vs. 20.4% for modelled data.427\nWhen analysing the results by land use, one should bear in mind that the428\nstratification layer contains inconsistent land classes, either due to classification errors, the429\nattribution of a dominant land use, where the ground sample was taken at a point with sub-430\ndominant land use, or simply a change in land use between observation periods. A total of431\n1 885 points fell on cultivated land in the land use layer. The most obvious discrepancy432\nbetween ground and modelled data for cultivated land occurs for Dystric Histosols (Od),433\nwhere a mean of 39.9% OC content for ground data contrasts with 17.5% for modelled434\ndata. The soil subgroup value was determined by only two ground sample points in an435\nSMU and in which the dominant STU covers 70% of the area (with 30% covered by Oe).436\nFor Eutric Histosols (Oe), the model over-estimates the average OC_TOP content by about437\n4% (15.5% for ground data, from 24 ground sample points) vs. 19.8% for modelled data.438\nBy contrast, the model underestimates OC for Humic Gleysoils (Gh) on cultivated land by439\n10.6%, though this finding is based on only 4 ground observations.440\nAccording to the land use layer, 1 012 ground sample points were located in semi-441\nnatural areas. Notable deviations from the generally good agreement between ground and442\nmodelled data were found only for Dystric Histosols (Od) and Molli-fluvic Gleysols (Gmf).443\nThe values for Od were determined by data from 95 sample points and the model444\noverestimated the mean OC contents by 10% (38.1% mean ground data OC vs. 48.2%445\nmean modelled OC). The OC values for Gmf were determined by just 2 sample points. The446\nmean OC value for the ground data was 18.8%, while the mean modelled OC value was447\n9.9%. As indicated in the graph, the CI95 was also rather large for the soil subgroup and the448\nmodelled mean was within the range of the interval by FAO soil unit.449\n19\nUsing SMUs as the aggregation unit, the overall mean OC_TOP is 6.5% for the450\nground data and 6.4% for the modelled data at the locations of the ground samples. The451\nresults of aggregating OC_TOP content by SMUs can be characterized in form of a linear452\ncorrelation. When relating the mean ground OC_TOPGRD to the mean model OC_TOPMOD453\nat the locations of ground samples, the following regression equation was determined:454\n455\nOC_TOPGRD = 0.82*OC_TOPMOD + 1.45 (2)456\n457\nThe coefficient of determination for the relationship (r2) is 0.95 for the average values from458\n71 SMUs with data. This indicates a highly significant relationship between the modelled459\ndata and the situation found on the ground within the SMUs of England and Wales and460\nsuggests that the model predicts OC contents well..461\n462\n2) England & Wales - Ground Data vs. Modelled Data by Catchment and NUTS:463\nThe results for primary catchments larger than 1000km2 and NUTS Level 2 units in464\nEngland & Wales are given in Table 3. For each catchment and NUTS unit, the Table465\ncontains the number of ground sample points within the area covered, the mean value of466\nOC_TOP content calculated from the ground survey and two values of mean OC_TOP467\ncontents calculated from the modelled OC_TOP content spatial layer. The mean OC_TOP468\nderived from the ground sample data for the whole of England and Wales is 6.7% for469\ncatchments and administrative units. The average value calculated from the modelled data470\nat the locations of the ground survey is 6.3% for larger catchments and for administrative471\nunits. With an average of 6.1% it is marginally less when using the complete area of either472\nspatial unit. For ground data, the average OC_TOP values for catchments range from 1.5%473\n(2.7% for NUTS) to 19.8% (13.9% for NUTS). The range of values for modelled data for474\n20\ncatchments is similar, spanning from 1.5% (2.4% for NUTS) to 19.8% (14.3% for NUTS).475\nThe larger range of values in catchments than in the NUTS units can be explained by the476\nnumber of smaller-sized catchments as compared to NUTS units, i.e. some local477\nparticularities are better represented in the smaller spatial units.478\nA graphical representation of the linear relation between ground observations and479\nmodelled data for England and Wales for catchments and NUTS units is given in Figure 5.480\nThe graph depicts for each primary catchment the data pair of average OC_TOP content481\nderived from ground data and from modelled data. Filled marker points (\uf06c) represent482\naverages from the point aggregation, boxes (\uf078) relate to values derived from area483\naggregation. The regression lines show the linear relationship between ground484\n(OC_TOPGRD) and modelled data (OC_TOPMOD) aggregated over catchments >1000km2485\nand NUTS Level 2 using point aggregation for all sample points. The mathematical486\nexpression of the relation is:487\n488\nCatchments: OC_TOPGRD = 0.88*OC_TOPMOD + 1.11 (3)489\nNUTS: OC_TOPGRD = 0.89*OC_TOPMOD + 1.07 (4)490\n491\nThe coefficient of determination (r2) of the relation is calculated as 0.94 for492\ncatchments and 0.93 for NUTS units. Determining the regression based on sample points,493\nrather than the spatial units themselves, reduces the influence of varying unit size in the494\nregression analysis. However, the simple calculation of the coefficient assumes that495\nobservations are independent. Yet, this is not the case when calculating the coefficient from496\naggregated sample points, because a fair degree of spatial dependence (auto-correlation)497\nbetween observations exists, largely overestimating the degrees of freedom.498\n499\n21\n3) Italy - Ground Data vs. Modelled Data by FAO soil subgroup: The Italian data set500\ncontains 6 779 ground measurements of OC content, of which 5 436 points were used to501\nrelate ground to modelled data by FAO soil subgroup code. A graphical representation of502\nthe OC content for soils is summarized in Figure 6. Because sampling was restricted to503\nagricultural land, the results show generally much smaller values for OC content compared504\nto those found for cultivated land in England and Wales (see Figure 4). Values for the505\nItalian data lie mainly in the range of 1-2% OC. This range is too small to calculate a506\nmeaningful coefficient of correlation between ground observations and modelled values.507\nHowever, the data are ideal for calibrating the AAAT correction function for areas with508\nsmall OC contents, characteristic of southern Europe. Noticeable is the over-estimation by509\nthe model of 6% for Dystric Histosols (Od) (5.1% ground data vs. 11.1% for model data).510\nThe mean value of OC content for Od was calculated from 11 points, which is not511\ninappropriately small, but an examination of the location of the points reveals that they are512\ndistributed across four spatial elements of a single, spatially non-continuous SMU, two513\ncontaining one sample, one containing two samples and one including seven sample sites.514\nThe values in the ground data included in the SMU vary from 0.8 to 14.0% OC content.515\nThe CI95 of the soil subgroup ranges from 2.9 to 7.9% and is the largest in the Italian data516\nset. The distribution of soils in the SMU is 45% Od, 45% Eutric Histosols (Oe) and 10%517\nEutric Gleysols (Ge). There are a number of possible explanations for the overestimation.518\nFirstly, the ground samples sites were intentionally selected and clustered at the field scale,519\nwhich accentuates the situation. Secondly, the Italian part of the European Soil Database520\nwas derived from a map of the soils of Italy drawn up in 1966, based on surveys made521\nduring the previous decade. The soils identified as Histosols during this survey, which522\nsubsequently have been sampled for the Italian OC data set, have been cultivated for more523\nthan 50 years. In this time the OM content has declined through mineralization to the524\n22\nextent that these soils may no longer be classified as organic. Thirdly, the sites sampled are525\nprobably small cultivated areas, which are located within a larger soil mapping unit526\ndominated by pasture and\/or semi-natural vegetation and hence not classified as arable in527\nthe land use layer.528\n529\n4) Italy - Ground Data vs. Modelled Data by NUTS:530\nThe results obtained from subjecting the Italian data to an analogous procedure of531\nestimating OC_TOP content for the 20 NUTS Level 2 are summarized in Table 4. The532\nanalysis of soil-independent units was restricted to NUTS, because the use of catchments533\ndid not give any significantly different answers. The total number of sample points used in534\nthe analysis of OC content by NUTS for the Italian data set was 4 500. The number was535\nless than in the analysis of soils because some 1km grid cells contained more than one536\nsample. In those cases the mean of all points within the grid cell was used. The mean537\nvalues for OC content in the Table are weighted by the portion of arable land by region.538\nThe overall mean OC_TOP content for the ground measurements was 1.2%. The mean539\ncalculated for the modelled data over the subset of sample points was also 1.2%. This540\namount is small, but is to be expected for agricultural land in Italy since the dry conditions541\nand high temperatures favour rapid oxidation of OM. The mean OC_TOP content,542\ncalculated from the area aggregation of the model data to NUTS units including all land543\nuse classes, is estimated at 2.4%. Although the OC values in the Italian data set are544\nrestricted by the selection criterion for sample sites, these findings indicate that the545\nmodelled data are correct estimates of OC_TOP content for agricultural land in Southern546\nEurope, when aggregated at the NUTS Level 2.547\n548\n23\nDiscussion and Conclusions549\nOur results demonstrate that the methodology described in this paper represents a realistic550\nalternative to approaches based on direct extrapolation of point observations, either by551\nassigning measured data from a small number of points (deemed to be representative of a552\nparticular soil type) to polygons delineated on a soil map that represent much larger areas553\nwith no measured values, or by employing a spatial extrapolation procedure of values554\nderived from point data. Even with the apparently large number of ground data points555\n(>12 000 values available to the study) some soils with limited spatial representation are556\nhardly included in the sample data. A stratification of the area by land use further reduces557\nthe number of observations per soil type and, as a consequence, lessens the reliability of558\nestimating OC content of a soil type under different land uses from ground data. A559\nsophisticated pedo-transfer rule has been successfully applied to the most detailed560\n(1:1 000 000 scale) harmonized spatial soil data that currently exist for Europe. The561\nconditions defined in the rule are a concentration of expert knowledge in the field soil OC562\ncontent. The original PTR, defined by Van Ranst et al. (1995), was to some extent limited563\nby the data available in the database. Having more detailed data available for land use and564\ntemperature has allowed the original rule (PTR 21) to be modified and extended to better565\ndistinguish between soils of large OC content. Processing directly in the spatial domain566\nwas made possible by technological advances in computer hardware and software. The567\nresults are thus encouraging not only because of the detailed quantification of soil OC568\ncontent at the European scale, but also for demonstrating the viability of using569\ncomprehensive spatial databases to generate standardized data layers that can be calibrated570\nby actual measurements (where these are available). There are several other sources of571\nvariation that could result in the calculated OC values deviating from the measured data572\nfrom ground surveys. Firstly, topsoil OC contents are known to vary considerably from573\n24\nplace to place because of differing land use history, timing of sampling and small574\nvariations in soil drainage conditions. Secondly, the land use at the time of sampling might575\nhave been different from that defined by the land cover data set (valid for the period 1988-576\n92). This could be a result of land use change or merely the effect of scale.577\nHowever, the results obtained from our study also demonstrate some limits in the578\ndetail of OC content estimates presented in the corresponding data layer. One limitation is579\nclearly set by the number of conditions defined in the rule. The more parameters that are580\ntaken into consideration the more precisely the conditions have to be defined. Even with581\none parameter less in the revised PTR, it was found necessary to define 140 conditions to582\ncharacterize topsoil OC content. Rather than adding more parameters, the rule could be583\nfurther refined by including more specific conditions. However, extending the detail of the584\nconditions will require a spatial regionalization of their applicable range and, as a585\nconsequence, a more complex system. Another limitation is imposed by the accuracy of the586\ndata used. The spatial units in the European Soil Database vary in detail depending on the587\nregion covered. Soils with very limited extent may not be well represented in areas covered588\nby the database. It would appear that some very organic soils fall into this category.589\nThese limitations in the geographical representation of ground conditions in the590\ndatabase must be considered carefully to avoid misinterpretations when comparing ground591\nwith modelled data. This was highlighted during the validation process. The systematic592\nsampling scheme for ground data in England and Wales has by design a tendency to under-593\nestimate the presence of soils with little representation in the area covered. On the other594\nhand, the clustered sampling scheme used in Italy does not provide independent measured595\nvalues due to auto-correlation of the sample sites. As a result, the areas defined in the596\ndatabase as being soils with large OC content display relatively large ranges of597\nmeasurements in the ground data located within the spatial units.598\n25\nFurther validations should be performed using measured data from other areas in599\nEurope and for the whole range of land cover types. This will be done when the relevant600\ndata sets are made available. There may be scope for further refining the definition of601\nparameters used for the temperature correction. The function parameters were set602\nempirically based on data from very different regions. Additional data could improve the603\ndefinition of the function, although in its present definition it corresponds to a general604\nrelationship of long standing. The research could also be extended to incorporate changes605\nin climatic conditions over longer and different periods, for example 1961-2000 and in606\ndecades, for example 1961-70, 1971-80 and 1981-90, thus providing valuable input data607\nfor global change modelling. For the purposes of modelling change or future developments,608\nthere might also be some merit in adding a correction, based on precipitation and evapo-609\ntranspiration data, to account for the effect that moisture may have on crop productivity and610\nOC turnover.611\nThe status of soil OC is known locally in many European countries. However,612\nexisting national data must be harmonized and new data collected for regions where OC613\ndata are scarce, before a new European map can be produced. The OC map of Europe thus614\nprovides the best general picture of the OC\/OM status in topsoils throughout the continent615\nat this time.616\n617\nAcknowledgements618\nWe thank all our colleagues in European Soil Bureau Network for their past and continuing619\ncollaboration in providing soil data and expertise for construction of the European Soil620\nDatabase.
