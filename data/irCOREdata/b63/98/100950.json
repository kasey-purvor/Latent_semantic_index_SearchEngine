Because of their loosely bound nature, to\nproperly understand and interpret such reactions, it is crucial\nto take into account the few-body degrees of freedom. At\nhigh energies, the multiple scattering expansion of the total\ntransition amplitude (MST) is a convenient framework that has\nalready been applied to analyze such reactions for elastic [1,2]\nas well as for inelastic [3,4] scattering. In the latter case, the\nmethod can take into account spin excitations that occur when\nscattering from a spin target such as a proton. In these calcu-\nlations, it is formal and numerically advantageous to represent\nthe continuum states in terms of a basis of square-integrable\nfunctions, also known as pseudostates (PSs). Unlike the\ntrue scattering states, the PSs vanish at large distances and\nhence the method will be only useful if the calculated observ-\nables are not sensitive to the asymptotic region. Moreover,\ncalculations performed with different families of states should\nconverge to the same results, provided that enough states are\nincluded and that the basis is complete within the radial region\nrelevant for the process under study.\nGuided by this motivation, in this Brief Report we present\nbenchmark calculations of proton inelastic scattering from\n6He within the MST framework, making use of two different\nPS bases to describe the 6He continuum. We aim to check to\nwhat extent the calculated breakup observables depend on the\nchoice of the PS functions.\nFor a Borromean system, such as 6He, the wave function for\na total angular momentum J (with projection M) and energy\n\u0001, \u03d5JM\u0001 , can be expressed in terms of the Jacobi coordinates \u0001r\n*Electronic address: moro@us.es\n\u2020Electronic address: mrodri@cii.fc.ul.pt; present address: Centro de\nF\u0131\u00b4sica Nuclear, Universidade de Lisboa, Avenida Prof. Gama Pinto 2,\nP-1649-003 Lisboa, Portugal.\n\u2021Electronic address: Raquel.Crespo@tagus.ist.utl.pt\n\u00a7Electronic address: I.Thompson@surrey.ac.uk\n(the relative coordinate between the valence nucleons) and \u0001R\n(the relative coordinate from the center of mass of the neutron\npair to the core).\nIt is also convenient to introduce a set of hyperspherical\ncoordinates: the hyper-radius \u03c1 and five hyperspherical polar\nangles \u00045 = {\u03b1, \u03b8x, \u03c6x, \u03b8y, \u03c6y}. The former is defined as\n\u03c1 =\n\u221a\nx2 + y2 with scaled coordinates \u0001x = 2\u22121\/2\u0001r and \u0001y =\n(2\/\u221a3) \u0001R. The angle \u03b1 = arctan(x\/y) is the hyperangle and\n\u03b8x, \u03c6x, \u03b8y, \u03c6y are the angles associated with the unit spatial\nvectors x\u02c6 and y\u02c6.\nWithin the PS method, the eigenstates \u03d5JM\u0001 (\u0001r, \u0001R) are\nobtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a basis of\nnormalizable states. These states are conveniently expanded in\na basis of hyperspherical harmonics of the form\n\u03c8JMn\u03b2 (\u0001r, \u0001R) = Rn\u03b2(\u03c1)\u03d2JM\u03b2 (\u00045), (1)\nwhere \u03d2JM\u03b2 (\u00045) is the generalized angle-spin basis [5]\n\u03d2JM\u03b2 (\u00045) =\n{YK\u000bx\u000byL(\u00045) \u2297 [\u03c7s2 \u2297 \u03c7s3]S}JM, (2)\nwith \u03c7si the neutron spin functions and YK\u000bx\u000byL(\u00045) the\nhyperspherical harmonics,\nYK\u000bx\u000byLML(\u00045) = \u03c8K\u000bx\u000by (\u03b1)\n[\nY\u000bx (x\u02c6) \u2297 Y\u000by (y\u02c6)\n]\nLML\n. (3)\nThe functions \u03c8K\u000bx\u000by (\u03b1) have an explicit form in terms of\nJacobi polynomials of the hyperangle\u03b1 [5]. The set of quantum\nnumbers \u03b2 = {K\u000bx\u000byLS} defines a channel, with \u000bx and\n\u000by the orbital angular momenta associated with the Jacobi\ncoordinates \u0001x and \u0001y,K = \u000bx + \u000by + 2\u03bd (\u03bd = 0, 1, 2, . . .) the\nhyperangular momentum, \u0001L = \u0001\u000bx + \u0001\u000by the total orbital angu-\nlar momentum, and S the spin of the particles related by the\ncoordinate \u0001x. In Eq. (1), Rn\u03b2(\u03c1) are the hyper-radial functions\nand n is an index that labels the basis states within a given\nchannel \u03b2.

First, we consider\nthe Gauss-Laguerre (GL) basis [6], whose hyper-radial part,\nRGLn (\u03c1), is given by\nRGLn (\u03c1) = \u03c10\u22123[n!\/(n + 5)!]1\/2L5n(z) exp(\u2212z\/2) , (5)\nwith z = \u03c1\/\u03c10, L5n the generalized Laguerre polynomials, and\n\u03c10 a parameter that sets the radial scale of the basis.\nThe second choice is the transformed harmonic oscillator\n(THO) basis, recently introduced in Ref. [7] for a three-body\nsystem. The THO method is based on the idea of transforming\nthe bound ground-state wave function of the system into the\nground-state wave function of the harmonic oscillator (HO),\ndefining a local scale transformation (LST). The ground-state\nwave function can be written as a linear combination of the\nbasis functions (1),\n\u03d5\nJ0M0\n0 (\u0001r, \u0001R) =\n\u2211\n\u03b2\nR\n\u00010\n\u03b2 (\u03c1)\u03d2J0M\u03b2 (\u00045), (6)\nwhere we have introduced the abbreviated notation \u03d5J0M00 \u2261\n\u03d5J0M0\u00010 . Then, the equation that defines the LST for each channel\n\u03b2 is \u222b \u03c1\n0\nd\u03c1 \u2032\u03c1 \u20325\n\u2223\u2223R\u00010\u03b2 (\u03c1 \u2032)\u2223\u22232 =\n\u222b s\n0\nds \u2032s \u20325\n\u2223\u2223RHO0K (s \u2032)\u2223\u22232, (7)\nwhere RHO0K (s) is the hyper-radial part of the HO ground state\nfor the hyperangular momentum K. Then, the THO basis is\nconstructed for each channel by applying the LST, s\u03b2(\u03c1), to\nthe HO basis\nRTHOn\u03b2 (\u03c1) = R\u00010\u03b2 (\u03c1)LK+2n\n(\ns2\u03b2(\u03c1)\n)\n, (8)\nwhere LK+2n are generalized Laguerre polynomials of degree\nn. For channels not included in the ground state, information\nfrom one of the known (ground-state) channels with the closest\nquantum labels to the channel of interest is used to construct\nthe LST, as explained in Ref. [7].\nNeither the GL nor the THO functions are eigenstates of\nthe Hamiltonian, but they provide a complete and orthonormal\nset in which the Hamiltonian can be diagonalized. For\nthis purpose, the basis is truncated by setting a maximum\nvalue of the index n (n = 0, . . . , N ) as well as a maximum\nhyperangular momentum Kmax. Upon diagonalization in the\ntruncated basis, the eigenstates are obtained as\n\u03d5JM\u0001i (\u0001r, \u0001R) =\n\u2211\nn\u03b2\nC\nJ\u0001i\nn\u03b2 \u03c8\nJM\nn\u03b2 (\u0001r, \u0001R), (9)\nwhere {\u0001i} are their associated eigenvalues.\nFrom this derivation, it becomes apparent that the GL basis\nis obtained in a more straightforward way than the THO\nbasis. However, the latter has some appealing properties that\ncould make it more suitable in some situations. In particular,\nthe THO basis has the advantage of being constructed from\nthe ground-state wave function of the system. Thus, when\nwe diagonalize the Hamiltonian in a finite THO basis, the\nground state is recovered for any size of the basis. By contrast,\nin the GL representation a large basis may be required to\nobtain a good description of the ground state. Also, note that\nthe hyper-radial part of the GL basis is the same for all the\nchannels \u03b2 whereas in the THO basis a different hyper-radial\npart is calculated for each channel, with the correct behavior\nat the origin (\u03c1K).\nFor a meaningful comparison between the two bases, we\nuse the same three-body Hamiltonian to generate the GL and\nTHO eigenstates for 6He. In particular, we use the n-n potential\nof Gogny, Pires, and de Tourreil [8] with spin-orbit and tensor\ncomponents and we take the n-4He potential from Ref. [9].\nBesides the pairwise interactions, an effective three-body\npotential is included, with matrix elements of the form [5]\nV 3B\u03b2 \u2032\u03b2(\u03c1) =\n\u03b4\u03b2 \u2032\u03b2V\n3B\nJ\n1 + (\u03c1\/5)3 . (10)\nThe J = 0 strength of this effective potential is tuned to\nreproduce the experimental three-body separation energy and\nthe J > 0 strength is adjusted to obtain the 2+1 resonance at\nthe experimental energy.\nWe now consider the scattering process of 6He, originally\nin its ground state, |\u03d5J0M00 \u3009, to a final continuum state |\u03d5JM\u0001 \u3009,\nat excitation energy \u0001 and with total angular momentum\nJ (projection M), by means of its interaction with a proton,\nwith initial (final) linear momentum \u0001k1(\u0001k \u20321) in the nucleon-\nnucleus c.m. frame and spin S1 = 1\/2 with projection \u03c3 (\u03c3 \u2032).\nThe double differential cross section for this process can be\nformally expressed as\nd2\u03c3JJ0\nd\u0004d\u0001\n= 1(S\u03021)2\n1\n(J\u03020)2\n[\nh\u00af2\n4\u03c02\u00b5NA\n]2\n\u00d7\n\u2211\n\u03c3\u03c3 \u2032\n\u2211\nMM0\n\u2223\u2223\u2329\u0001k\u20321\u03c7\u03c3 \u2032S1 ; \u03d5JM\u0001 \u2223\u2223T \u2223\u2223\u0001k1\u03c7\u03c3S1 ; \u03d5J0M00 \u232a\u2223\u22232, (11)\nwhere T denotes the transition amplitude operator [10]. This\noperator can be expressed as a multiple expansion series in\nthe transition amplitudes t\u02c6I for proton scattering from each\nprojectile subsystem I [11]. At high energies and for small\nmomentum transfers, this expansion is expected to converge\nquickly. If only the leading term of the series is retained, the\nsingle scattering approximation (SSA) is obtained [3,12]:\nT SSA =\n4\u2211\nI=2\nt\u02c61I (12)\nwith I = 2, 3 for the halo neutrons, and I = 4 for the core.\nThe proton-I subsystem transition amplitude satisfies the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation\nt\u02c61I = v1I + v1IG0 t\u02c61I , (13)\nwith v1I the interaction between the nucleon and I subsystem.\nWithin the impulse approximation, the propagator G0 =(\nE+ \u2212 K)\u22121 contains the kinetic energy operators of the\nproton and all the projectile subsystems. Here E is the kinetic\nenergy, E = h\u00af2k21\/2\u00b5NA in the overall c.m. frame, and \u00b5NA is\nthe proton-projectile reduced mass.\nWithin the PS method, the scattering states \u03d5JM\u0001 in Eq. (11)\nare approximated by the pseudostates \u03d5JM\u0001i .

The amplitude\nt[b\u03b2SpS \u2032p] is given in terms of the tensor components of the\nnucleon-nucleon transition amplitude [2,13]. The transition\ndensity form factors, \u03c1[b\u03b2;ST S \u2032T \u0001i ], depend exclusively on the\nstructure of the composite system. Its explicit expression as a\nfunction of the hyper-radial parts of the wave functions of the\ninitial and final states can be found in Ref. [2].\nThe scattering from the core, assumed here as spinless, can\nequivalently be written as\u2329\u0001k\u20321\u03c7\u03c3 \u2032S1 ; \u03d5JM\u0001i \u2223\u2223t\u02c614\u2223\u2223\u0001k1\u03c7\u03c3S1 ; \u03d5J0M00 \u232a\n= t[00SpS \u2032p](\u03c914,\u0012) \u00d7 \u03c1[00;ST S \u2032T \u0001i ]\n(\n0,\nM23\nM234\n\u0001\u0012\n)\n, (16)\nwhere, as before, \u03c914 is the appropriate energy parameter\n[2].

Each curve includes the contribution from eigeinstates up\nto 10 MeV in excitation energy, according to Eq. (17).\nhyperangular momentum was set to Kmax = 20. This yields\nthe three-body force parameters V 3B0 = \u22122.4 MeV, for J = 0,\nand V 3BJ = \u22120.85 MeV, for J > 0.\nIn Fig. 1 we show the angular distribution of the calculated\ninelastic differential cross sections. For simplicity, only the\nJ\u03c0 = 0+ continuum is included, and the Coulomb interaction\nbetween the proton and the \u03b1 core is ignored. The three lines\nrepresent the SSA calculation for different values of the basis\nsize, according to the choice of the parameter N . The three\ncases are in almost perfect agreement, indicating that in this\nreaction the convergence with the basis size is very fast.\nNext, we study the dependence of the breakup observables\non the choice of the basis, by comparing the calculations in\nthe GL and THO representations. As before, the maximum\nhyperangular momentum was set to Kmax = 20, and only\neigenstates below 10 MeV are considered. The index n\nwas truncated to N = 20 and N = 4 for the GL and THO\nbases, respectively. With this model space, the number of\npseudostates in the GL (THO) basis is 31 (30) for 0+, 63(86)\nfor 1\u2212, 53(49) for 1+, and 79 (81) for 2+. For the GL\nbasis, the range parameter was set to \u03c10 = 0.25 fm, which\nprovides a basis that extends up to about 20 fm in the\nhyper-radius. With these parameters, the ground state obtained\nafter diagonalization of the Hamiltonian appears at \u22120.9781\nand \u22120.9549 MeV, for the GL and THO bases, respectively.\nIn Fig. 2 we compare the inelastic angular distributions\ncalculated in the GL and THO bases. The separate\ncontributions for J\u03c0 = 0+, 1\u2212, 1+, and 2+ final states are\nalso shown. As before, the Coulomb interaction is neglected.\nThe thick lines are the incoherent sum of all these J\u03c0\ncontributions. Solid and dashed lines correspond, respectively,\nto the calculations with the GL and THO bases. For each\ncurve, the contribution of eigenstates up to \u0001max = 10 MeV are\nadded incoherently, according to Eq. (17). We consider only\nthe forward angles \u03b8c.m. < 30\u25e6 since the SSA is not expected\nto work well at large momentum transfers [2]. We see that, at\nthese angles, the dominant contribution to the breakup cross\nsection comes from the 1\u2212 states, whereas for \u03b8c.m. > 25\u25e6,\n017603-3\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 75, 017603 (2007)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n\u03b8\nc.m.\n (deg)\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\nd\u03c3\nin\nel\n\/d\n\u2126\n \n(m\nb\/s\nr)\nTotal\n1-\n2+\n0+\n1+\nFIG. 2. (Color online) Calculated contributions for breakup dif-\nferential cross section leading to final states with J \u03c0 = 0+, 1\u2212, 1+,\nand 2+, using the SSA. Solid and dashed lines refer to the GL and\nTHO basis, respectively.\nthe 2+ excitation becomes dominant. Finally, the population\nof the unnatural parity 1+ states is almost negligible at all\nangles. We notice that this excitation mode requires spin-flip\ntransitions, which, according to these calculations, are very\nsmall in this reaction.\nFor all these contributions, the GL and THO bases provide\nvery similar results, suggesting that the calculated observables\ndo not depend on the choice of the continuum representation,\nprovided that enough states are included.\nIn summary, in this Brief Report we have calculated proton\ninelastic scattering from 6He at 717 MeV\/nucleon, using\nas scattering framework the single-scattering approximation\nand two different pseudostate representations of the 6He\ncontinuum: the GL and the THO. Provided that enough states\nare included, both bases predict essentially the same inelastic\ndifferential cross section. Furthermore, the studied observables\nconverge very quickly with the size of the basis. These results\nsupport the reliability of the pseudostate method as a useful\nand convenient tool to treat scattering problems dealing with\ncontinuum states. This analysis could be extended to other\nPS bases and reactions. Furthermore, it could be applied to\nother scattering frameworks, for which the PS method has also\nbeen implemented, such as the continuum discretized coupled\nchannels method [14,15].\nWe are grateful to J.
