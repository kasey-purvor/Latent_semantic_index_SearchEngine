Most of \nthis literature concentrates on identifying factors and developments behind processes \nof decline. This paper reviews the literature, focusing on the identification of patterns \nof neighbourhood change, and argues that the concept of neighbourhood governance \nis a missing link in attempts to explain these patterns.  Including neighbourhood \ngovernance in the explanations of neighbourhood change and decline will produce \nbetter explanatory models and, finally, a better view about what is actually steering \nneighbourhood change. \n \nKey words: neighbourhood, governance, neighbourhood change, neighbourhood \ndecline \n \nIntroduction \nNumerous studies of neighbourhood change, and of neighbourhood decline in \nparticular, have been published in the last century. It has been adequately described in \nmost of these studies that problems confronting particular neighbourhoods never stand \nalone but are connected with one another and in most cases also with developments \noutside the area (see, e.g., Hall, 1997; Marcuse & Van Kempen, 2000; Megbolugbe et \nal., 1996; Murie et al., 2003; Van Kempen, 2002). Knowledge of how to handle these \nproblems has been extended in the last two decades, by combining several ideas from \ntraditional approaches and by developing comprehensive models of neighbourhood \n 3\nchange.TPF1FPT Despite all these efforts, however, one major field of activity appears to have \nreceived insufficient attention in the models, namely, that of neighbourhood \ngovernance. \n We start, therefore, with an analysis of what is meant by neighbourhood \ngovernance. We then move on to a discussion of ecological and behavioural \napproaches to neighbourhood change, drawing mainly from sociological and \ncriminological literature. We develop the argument that governance tends to be a \nsilent factor in such accounts, mediated largely through an emphasis on social \ninstitutions and structures. We then focus on more structural approaches, varying \naccording to their emphases on economic, social or spatial dimensions. Here we \nhighlight the absence of a theoretically explicit account of neighbourhood \ngovernance. Finally, through a discussion of the value and limitations of structural \napproaches, we foreground the concept of neighbourhood governance as a means to \nimprove our understanding of neighbourhood dynamics. We conclude with some \ncomments about how horizontally developed neighbourhood governance structures \nmight play a role in wider programmes of democratic integration and inclusion. \n \nThe meaning of neighbourhood governance \nIn recent years, especially in England, there has been an increasing interest in the \nneighbourhood as a site or space for urban and social activity, and particularly for \ngovernance activity (Taylor, 2000; Kearns and Parkinson, 2001; Sullivan, 2001, 2002; \nWhitehead, 2003; ODPM, 2005; Purdue, 2005; Robinson et al., 2005; Hilder, 2006; \nKeil, 2006; White et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2007). A recent issue of Urban Studies, \n                                                 \nTP\n1\nPT In addition, there has been a burgeoning literature on community participation designed to address \nthese problems but, as shown below, this has not necessarily involved participation in governance and, \nwhere it has, the governance in which such participation occurs has not necessarily been \nneighbourhood governance. \n 4\nhowever, suggested that \u2018the neighbourhood is at best a chaotic concept\u2019 (Kennett and \nForrest, 2006: 715), with its use, meaning and role varying enormously across \nEuropean societies. Galster (2001), on the other hand, suggests that the meaning of \nneighbourhood is clear enough, being tied to the value of its attributes for those \nlocated in a defined territory: that is, where a group of people all derive value from \nthe same attributes of the same area, we can call that area a neighbourhood. The \napparently chaotic character of \u2018neighbourhood\u2019, then, could be due to confusion \nabout its precise scale of operations, i.e. where its territory is not clearly defined or is \ncontested (Somerville, 2009). \nThe literature on governance in general, and on urban governance in \nparticular, has grown immensely in the past two decades. It is not our intention to \nreview this literature here, but it is important to come to a definition. In essence \ngovernance is about working together, about the cooperation between different (kinds \nof) stakeholders, such as national and local government, residents and resident \norganisations, housing associations and private partners such as developers and \ninsurance companies (see, e.g., Bailey et al., 1995; Clark & Newman, 1997; Dekker & \nVan Kempen, 2004; Imrie & Raco, 1999; Kooiman, 1993; Rhodes, 1996; Rhodes, \n1997; Elander, 2002; Stone, 1989). Governance can be understood, following Le \nGal\u00e8s (1998: 496), as a double capacity, to shape collectivities (interests, groups, \norganisations, territories) and to represent them in different arenas. Kooiman (2005) \nhas distinguished three modes of governance: hierarchical governance, self-\ngovernance and co-governance. Hierarchical governance is \u2018top-down\u2019 governance in \nwhich a central \u2018governator\u2019 dominates the shaping and representing of a collectivity. \nSelf-governance is \u2018bottom-up\u2019 governance in which a collectivity is able to shape \nand represent itself. Co-governance is then where a collectivity works co-operatively \n 5\nwith other collectivities, in a process of mutual shaping and mutual representation. \nWe have found this typology useful for making sense of neighbourhood governance.  \nUsing Le Gal\u00e8s\u2019 definition, neighbourhood governance can be conceptualised \nin terms of the capacity to shape the attributes of a neighbourhood (as defined by \nGalster) and to represent that neighbourhood, at least partially, in interactions with \nothers. Such shaping can be conducted in an unplanned way, through interactions \nbetween elements of the neighbourhood (not just among residents or those with a \n\u2018stake\u2019 in the neighbourhood but also between residents and features of the neighbour-\nhood environment), or in a planned way, through organisations and institutions set up \nspecifically for this purpose.TPF2FPT These individuals and organisations also provide the \nmeans by which the neighbourhood is represented in other arenas. We hypothesise \nthat the decisions and actions of such organisations play a key role in neighbourhood \nchange and we will make clear that the importance of such decisions and actions is \nunderestimated, or even not recognised, in many important theoretical models of \nneighbourhood change and decline. We reject, however, the conflation of \nneighbourhood governance with neighbourhood management or with \u2018arrangements \nfor collective decision-making and\/or public service delivery at the sub-local authority \nlevel\u2019 (Lowndes and Sullivan, 2008, cited in Smith et al, 2007: 2).TPF3FPT \nFollowing Kooiman (2005), neighbourhood governance can be hierarchical \nand even more or less forced, where the shaping and representing of the \nneighbourhood is conducted, for example, by national or local government based \noutside the neighbourhood, with little scope for alternative shaping or representation \n                                                 \nTP\n2\nPT Recent research on neighbourhood governance in Britain (Somerville & Haines, 2008) indicates a \nhuge variety, not only of neighbourhood governance bodies themselves (e.g. parish and town councils, \nneighbourhood management bodies, community-based housing organisations and community \nassociations and forums) but also of activities performed by these different bodies. \nTP\n3\nPT Neighbourhood management involves shaping but not necessarily representing of the neighbourhood. \nThe definition by Lowndes and Sullivan, on the other hand, includes forms of representation but not \nnecessarily of the neighbourhood. \n 6\nfrom local residents. Here the governance institution is typically a governmental body \nacting as an instrument or \u2018site\u2019 (Smith et al., 2007) for the implementation of \ngovernment policies within the neighbourhood. Or it can be self-governance, where \nthe shaping and representing of the neighbourhood is carried out by the residents \nthemselves. Here governance institutions are typically community or residents\u2019 \nassociations or forums based in the neighbourhood. Or it can be co-governance, where \nthe shaping and representation of the neighbourhood is done jointly by governmental \nand non-governmental bodies, for example, in forms of neighbourhood partnership. \n \nEcological and behavioural approaches to neighbourhood change \nEvidence from a wide variety of sources, and over several decades, has supported the \nthesis that the key causes of neighbourhood change are socio-economic (particularly, \nunemployment and poverty), with their effects being mediated by housing market \nprocesses and social relations within the neighbourhood itself (see, for example, \nMolotch, 1976; Pahl, 1975, 1977; Lipsky, 1980; Taub et al., 1984; Schuerman & \nKobrin, 1986; Evans, 1998; Walklate & Evans, 1999; Hancock, 2001; Bottoms & \nWiles, 2002; Lupton, 2004). This section and the following one review the main \nattempts to understand neighbourhood change that have been developed over the \nyears. \nThe first of these attempts was probably the human ecology approach of the \nChicago School in the 1920s with their identification of filtering processes resulting \nfrom an ageing housing supply (see, for example, Burgess, 1925; Hoyt, 1933; and \nlater Birch, 1971). Since the Second World War, evidence for such long-term \nprocesses of change has been found in the public housing sectors of many countries, \naccording to which higher-income households have tended to move out, and been \n 7\nreplaced by lower-income households, resulting in a decline in the status of public \nhousing neighbourhoods (Cole & Furbey, 1994). Such processes of succession, along \nwith processes of invasion and filtering, can still be identified in numerous \nneighbourhoods throughout the world (see, e.g., Power, 1997; Murie et al., 2003; Hall \net al., 2003, for an overview of the developments in London and Birmingham; \nAalbers et al., 2003, for an overview of the developments in Amsterdam and Utrecht; \nTurkington et al., 2004). \nThe human ecology approach, however, was soon criticised as being over-\nsimplified and over-deterministic (see, for example, Firey, 1947; and later, Ahlbrandt \n& Brophy, 1975; Ahlbrandt & Cunningham, 1979). For the purpose of this paper, we \ncan add that attention to neighbourhood governance was lacking in these studies.  \nA number of the early critics of the Chicago School advocated a focus on a \nmore behavioural approach, in which neighbourhood decline (and perhaps \nneighbourhood change generally) is not seen as an inevitable process but can be offset \nby people\u2019s conscious actions, and specifically also by the strength of social networks \nwithin neighbourhoods (see, e.g., Ahlbrandt & Cunningham, 1979; Varady, 1986; \nTemkin & Rohe, 1996; 1998). Implicitly agreeing with this, Bottoms and colleagues \n(1992: 123), for example, suggested that the housing market \u2018interacts with a range of \nother aspects of social life to create the relevant social effects\u2019, for example, social \nnetworks, socialisation processes, social control agencies, reputations and labels, \neconomic development, and the physical form of the locality. The web of interaction \nis complex, but Bottoms and his co-workers believe that it is possible to identify \ncertain patterns of change in particular neighbourhoods.  \nInitial evidence for the existence of such patterns of neighbourhood change \nwas provided by Baldwin & Bottoms (1976) in their studies of Sheffield. Their first \n 8\nstudy identified housing allocation processes as a key factor in explaining why two \nsimilar interwar council housing estates, with similar social class and gender \ncomposition, and relatively well-settled populations, had such different offending \nrates (three times as high in one as in the other). Although both estates began as \n\u2018good\u2019, crime-free areas in the 1920s, one of them \u2018tipped\u2019 sometime in the 1940s for \nreasons unknown and, once tipped, the council\u2019s allocation rules had the unintended \neffect of maintaining the difference between the two areas. When their study was \nreplicated in 1988, however, the offence rates on the two estates were similar. The \nreason for this was that the worse estate improved, as modernisation and decanting \nbroke up the criminal sub-culture that had long existed on part of the estate, the child \ndensity was reduced, the local school improved, and a crime reduction initiative \n(strengthening residents\u2019 organisational capacity) had a long-term impact; while the \nbetter estate deteriorated, through rehousing slum tenants and homeless families \n(Bottoms et al., 1989; Bottoms et al., 1992; Bottoms & Wiles, 2002: 635-6). This \nexample illustrates how long-term processes of neighbourhood decline and rise can \nresult from a complex combination of ecological (e.g. population moves), \ninstitutional (e.g. management rules) and sub-cultural (e.g. offending cultures) \nfactors.  \nThe importance of this study for our argument in this paper is that the \nmanagement rules look like manifestations of neighbourhood governance, in the sense \nthat they are rules about how housing should be allocated in a neighbourhood. \nInterestingly, however, the purpose of these rules is not to shape the attributes of the \nneighbourhood in which they apply, let alone represent that neighbourhood to others. \nRather, the purpose of these rules is to ensure the fair distribution of housing on a \n 9\nmunicipal scale \u2013 there are no rules specific to the neighbourhood and no \nrepresentation of the neighbourhood at the municipal level.  \nIn their research in Chicago, Taub and colleagues (1984) similarly concluded \nthat changes in neighbourhood status could be explained in terms of a behavioural \nmix of ecological, institutional and sub-cultural or individual factors. The factors \ninvolved, however, were slightly different from those identified by Bottoms and \ncolleagues. The ecological factors were the potential employment base, the pressure \non the housing market, the age and quality of the housing stock, and the nature of the \nlocal amenities. The institutional factors were corporate and institutional decisions, \nfor example, by banks, insurance companies and universities. And the individual or \nsub-cultural factors were decisions to move home, for example, because of \ndissatisfaction with the area or concerns about crime or fears of abandonment. In this \ncase, the institutions involved were primarily private rather than public sector, \nreflecting perhaps the institutional and political differences between the UK and the \nUS. As with Baldwin and Bottoms, however, the researchers did not explicitly \nidentify any particular capacity (whether ecological, institutional or sub-cultural) to \nshape the attributes of a neighbourhood or to represent the neighbourhood to others, \ni.e. the issue of neighbourhood governance (or the lack of it) was not addressed.TPF4FPT \nTaub et al (1984) also noticed something else. They identified the possibility \nthat different neighbourhood residents respond differently to similar neighbourhood \nattributes (see also Temkin & Rohe, 1996). The effect of this difference is to make \n                                                 \nTP\n4\nPT For another example, see Schuerman & Kobrin (1986). Here, changes in neighbourhoods from low-\ncrime to high-crime status are also explained in terms of a combination of ecological (demographic \nchange, such as population decline, an increase in the proportion of unrelated residents, and an increase \nin residential mobility), institutional (shifts in land use, such as an increase in renting or in apartment \ndwellings) and sub-cultural (changes in the socio-economic status of residents, such as more unskilled \nand more unemployed, and in explicit subculture variables such as an increase in black and minority \nethnic households) factors. However, this is little different from an ecological approach, because the \ninstitutional and sub-cultural factors are themselves presented as quasi-ecological, i.e. as involving \nsuccession, invasion, filtering, etc. \n 10\npatterns of neighbourhood change potentially far more complex. The researchers \nnoted that the impact of disorder, for example, depends, in part, on the level of \ntolerance community members feel towards that disorder, with different members \nhaving more or less tolerance or more or less capacity to move away. Similarly, a \nlongitudinal study of neighbourhoods in Baltimore (Taylor, 2001) found that disorder \nor incivilities were not as consistently important as other features of the \nneighbourhood, particularly its social status.TPF5FPT So it appears that certain features of the \nneighbourhood environment (such as the prevalence of crime and disorder) can cause \nneighbourhood decline, while other features (to do with residents\u2019 capacity and \namenities) can act against this. These studies suggest a certain \u2018collective efficacy\u2019 \n(Sampson et al, 1997) or resilience that residents exhibit in the face of neighbourhood \ndecline, but they fall short of explicitly identifying forms of resident shaping or \nrepresentation of the neighbourhood that might embody or institutionalise such \nefficacy or resilience. The possibility that \u2018voice\u2019 as well as \u2018exit\u2019 might determine \nneighbourhood change is raised for the first time in these studies, but the forms of \nexpression of that voice remain to be explored.  \nAnother example of a behavioural approach is Prak & Priemus (1986). From \ntheir studies of social rented housing in Europe, and in the Netherlands in particular, \nthey developed a model of neighbourhood change based on three self-reinforcing or \nmutually reinforcing spirals of decline: social, economic and technical. In this model, \nrelatively small changes in one factor can trigger more far-reaching consequences \nacross a range of factor types. Social decline concerns changes that take place within \nthe tenant population. When the attractiveness of an estate decreases, more and more \nhigh-income households might move out and the number of low-income households \n                                                 \nTP\n5\nPT This finding is strongly echoed in Robertson et al (2008), who concluded that three neighbourhoods \nin Stirling, Scotland, had retained their relative social status over a period of centuries.  \n 11\nin these particular areas will rise. The increasing mobility of residents causes faster \nturnover rates, which in turn can lead to vacancies, vandalism, pollution, low tenant \nparticipation and a further decline in the neighbourhood\u2019s reputation. These \ndevelopments may result in technical decline, which can again lead to further \nmobility. Both social and technical decay may result in decreasing rent income \n(because of increasing mobility and the influx of more and more low-income \nhouseholds). At the same time, higher turnover rates, problems with tenants, \nincreasing maintenance and, for example, landlords\u2019 attempts to ensure that the \ncomplex remains competitive, result in higher running costs (economic decline). A \nlandlord may react to this unfavourable situation by relaxing the allocation rules for \nits properties, meaning that low-income households can enter the area more easily. \nAlso, they can decide to invest less in maintenance. In both cases the spirals of \ndecline continue to strengthen one another.  \nSuperficially, this model appears very different from those of Bottoms et al., \nTaub et al., etc. Within it, however, one can detect the same sets of causal factors at \nwork, namely, ecological (resident moves, condition of housing stock), institutional \n(housing management and maintenance practices) and sub-cultural (tenant behaviour). \nThe model does not, however, explicitly cite any factors related to the intentional \nshaping and representing of a neighbourhood as a whole.  \nStill following a behavioural approach, Bottoms & Wiles (2002: 632) have \npointed to the role of peer influence or sub-culture, affecting daily routines, social \nactivities, and thought processes. Such sub-cultural factors can either alleviate or \nexacerbate the changes in neighbourhood status resulting from factors of other types. \nLupton (2004), for example, found that \u2018the illegal economy was normal, rational and \nwell-established\u2019 in poverty neighbourhoods, involving drug dealing, buying stolen \n 12\ngoods and shoplifting to order. However, such criminal activity can co-exist with \nstrong social networks within the neighbourhood and does not necessarily signify low \nneighbourhood status, so the common assumption that crime and disorder is generally \nassociated with neighbourhood decline is not correct (May et al., 2005). Rather, the \nrelationship between the two is less direct and more complex. This suggests a need to \nmove beyond behavioural approaches towards more sophisticated theoretical \napproaches that attempt to take account of such complexity.  \n \nStructural approaches to neighbourhood change \nThe behavioural approach is useful so far as it goes, therefore, but is limited in that it \ndoes not explain how factors of different types might interact so as to produce given \nkinds of neighbourhood change. Also, its conceptions of the different types of factors \nraise further questions about what, in turn, might be responsible for them \u2013 e.g. the \ncauses of population migration, corporate decisions, offending cultures, etc. \nAhlbrandt (1984: 123), therefore, on the basis of a random survey of 6,000 residents \nof Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, suggested a new typology, in which neighbourhood \nchange can be understood in three different ways: economically, in terms of \nhousehold incomes or property values (e.g. gentrification or residualisation); socially, \nin terms of the character of its residential population (e.g. its mix of classes, ethnic \ngroups, ages and household types); or with a focus on housing. Each of these ways of \nunderstanding conveys a greater breadth and depth of content than the typologies of \neither Bottoms et al. (1976) or Taub et al. (1984). Clearly, the relationships among the \nfactors concerned are complex and vary from one neighbourhood to another. Taken \ntogether, they comprise the three dimensions of what Ahlbrandt (1984: 39) called the \n\u2018neighbourhood environment\u2019. Despite the ecological language, therefore, this can be \n 13\nseen to represent a step towards a more structural approach to understanding \nneighbourhood change, in the sense of an approach that attempts to explain this \nchange in terms of sets of relationships underlying manifest forms of behaviour.TPF6FPT \n \n1) Economic dimension \nFollowing a structural approach, Grigsby and colleagues (1987) looked more closely \nat the economic dimension of neighbourhood change. Specifically, they emphasised \nthe importance of changes in socio-economic variables, causing households to change \ntheir behaviour in the housing market, resulting in changes in dwelling and \nneighbourhood characteristics. Grigsby et al particularly highlighted the concentration \nof poverty in a neighbourhood, associated with a critical mass of residents with \nbehavioural problems, resulting in the unravelling of the neighbourhood\u2019s social \nfabric (see also Hope & Shaw, 1988). Similarly, Lupton (2004) found that the pattern \nof decline, based on deindustrialisation and housing market change, was the same in \nall twelve of her case study areas, with the additional factor, in some areas, of a \ndecline in public services, especially policing. Although significant reductions in \nunemployment had occurred in all twelve areas, a new \u2018culture of disposability\u2019, \nbased on low skilled and temporary work, had taken root (Lupton, 2004: 201), so that \nthe local economy remained unhealthy. \nBoth of these studies, along with many others with similar findings TPF7FPT, tend to \nsuggest that residents in many (poorer) neighbourhoods are virtually powerless in the \nface of wider economic, institutional and political forces. Neither of them, however, \n                                                 \nTP\n6\nPT In contrast, ecological and behavioural approaches focus only on the activities within a \nneighbourhood, and attempt to identify patterns to those activities. \nTP\n7\nPT See, for example, Power (1997), on so-called \u2018mass\u2019 housing estates across Europe. For reviews of \ncase studies of the effects of economic change on neighbourhoods and communities, see Crow and \nAllan (1994) and Day (2006). \n \n 14\nexplicitly considers the issue of the absence of governance structures and processes in \nsuch neighbourhoods (which could shape and represent the neighbourhood as a \nwhole) and therefore what difference the introduction of such neighbourhood \ngovernance might make. Neighbourhoods are seen as shaped by outside forces but \nthey do not appear to enjoy any form of representation. \n \n2) Social dimension \nStudies emphasising the social dimension have used concepts of social trust, social \nfabric, social capital and collective efficacy. There would appear to be general \nagreement among them that these are crucial factors influencing neighbourhood \nchange. We would argue that these concepts are important for highlighting  the \nsystem of norms and sanctions that may exist in a neighbourhood, and so provide \nsome understanding of how neighbourhoods are shaped, but they fall short of a focus \non structures in and through which a neighbourhood can be represented, i.e. \ngovernance structures. .  \nGreen and colleagues (2005), for example, looked at the sustainability of eight \nformer coal-mining neighbourhoods in South Yorkshire, characterised by persistent \nlabour market disadvantage, and concluded that there was a strong relationship \nbetween neighbourhood assets \u2013 particularly social assets of trust, safety and \nreciprocity \u2013 and neighbourhood well-being. Where residents mistrusted their \nneighbours, they were more likely to want to move away, to a \u2018better area\u2019 and, \nbecause of increased housing provision in the sub-region, they were often more able \nto do so. This led to a spiral of decline in those neighbourhoods where little \nregeneration investment had taken place. People moving out of the neighbourhoods \ntended to be younger, healthier and better qualified, so there was a need for initiatives \n 15\n(e.g. affordable housing provision) that would attract similar people back into the \nareas. Such initiatives, however, are unable to guarantee the sustainability of the \nneighbourhoods concerned, as the newcomers are unlikely to mix with the existing \nresidents, even within the same housing development. This study therefore shows the \nimportance of social trust within a neighbourhood (mediated through the housing \nmarket) for arresting its decline when labour market conditions are unfavourable. The \nquestion of structures for shaping and representation, however, is addressed only \nindirectly, in connection with policy going beyond the neighbourhood on, for \nexample, health and regeneration. The concept of social trust is not placed within a \ncontext of developing governance on a neighbourhood scale. \nSimilarly, Temkin & Rohe (1996) stress the importance of the social fabric for \nencouraging or resisting neighbourhood change, where \u2018social fabric\u2019 is understood as \na combination of \u2018intimate bonds\u2019 (of kinship and strong friendship) and \n\u2018neighbouring\u2019 developed through borrowing, visiting and helping activities \n(Ahlbrandt, 1984: 108). Although they give priority to economic and social forces \noutside the neighbourhood (e.g. loss of manufacturing jobs or an influx of ethnic \nminorities), they show that it is essential to consider how these forces are actually \nplayed out within each neighbourhood and, in particular, how local residents and \norganisations interpret and respond to these forces. For example, residents may decide \nto move or to organise instead, while institutions may try to resist the change, e.g. \nthrough increasing public investment (Temkin & Rohe, 1996: 166). Clearly, \nneighbourhoods with a strong social fabric are better able to resist changes than areas \nwith a weak social fabric. In general, the concept of social fabric seems very similar \nto that of social capital, especially bonding social capital. Arguably, therefore, social \n 16\nfabric could form the foundation on which neighbourhood governance can be built, \nbut this possibility remains undeveloped.  \nWriters using the concept of social capital have noted how the attenuation and \ndecline of social relations within a neighbourhood can reduce its liveability or the \nquality of life of its residents (for a comprehensive review, see Halpern, 2005). Also, \nSampson et al. (1997) argue that high crime neighbourhoods lack the kinds of social \ncapital that would allow them to define collective goals and then organise effectively \nto achieve them, and they call this a lack of collective efficacy. In the context of a \nneighbourhood, they define collective efficacy as \u2018the linkage of mutual trust and the \nwillingness to intervene for the common good\u2019 (Sampson et al., 1997: 919). Their \nresearch shows that variations in violent crime rates among Chicago neighbourhoods \ncan be partially explained by the relative possession of the capacity for collective \nefficacy (Sampson et al., 1997: 923). Clearly again, willingness to intervene for the \ncommon good looks like a necessary condition for effective neighbourhood \ngovernance \u2013 indeed, it could be argued that willingness to act for the good of a \nneighbourhood is an indicator of capacity to shape and represent that neighbourhood. \nThis idea, however, is not developed here.TPF8FPT \n \n3) Housing dimension \n                                                 \nTP\n8\nPT One problem with the collective efficacy approach is that it assumes that the community is basically \ncomposed of \u2018good citizens\u2019. As Bottoms & Wiles (2002: 644) point out, however, some criminal \ngangs can be collectively efficacious but the results are not necessarily desirable for the community as \na whole. For example, in Walklate & Evans (1999), the Salford Firm in Oldtown policed local criminal \nincidents by giving culprits a \u2018smacking\u2019 (physical chastisement) and by intimidating \u2018grasses\u2019 (people \nwho complained to the police about the Firm\u2019s actions). More generally, differences and divisions \nwithin communities can mean that a high level of population turnover (working against collective \nefficacy) can co-exist with a stable community of residents (working in favour of collective efficacy) \n(Hancock, 2001: 188). Case studies of different housing estates suggest that such a situation may not be \nuncommon (Reynolds, 1986; Page, 2000). Such empirical considerations suggest that theories of social \ncapital and collective efficacy, while potentially very useful in drawing attention to the agency \ndimension of neighbourhood change, may, like previous ecological and behavioural concepts, suffer \nfrom a certain circularity and lack of explanatory \u2018bite\u2019 (e.g. neighbourhood improvement is caused by \ncollective efficacy, while collective efficacy is whatever causes neighbourhood improvement). \n 17\nIt is clear that housing figures prominently in the literature on neighbourhood change. \nThe US studies tend to focus on the private housing market while the European \nstudies have mainly looked at social rented housing. In spite of this difference, the \nfindings are similar, in that the rules by which the tenure operates tend to mediate the \necological facts, though in different ways. The private market uses the price \nmechanism to determine concentrations of poorer households in declining \nneighbourhoods. According to followers of the neo-weberian approach, for example, \nthere is competition between households to gain access to desirable dwellings \n(\u2018housing classes\u2019) (Rex & Moore, 1967). Whether a household has this access or not \nis highly influenced by its resources, for example income (see Van Kempen & \n\u00d6z\u00fcekren, 1998, for an overview of these resources). The social rented sector, on the \nother hand, employs bureaucratic or (more recently) \u2018choice-based\u2019 allocation to \nachieve almost similar results.  \nAn important consideration here is that wider economic inequality combined \nwith government policy that is oriented to market provision can result in a process of \nresidualisation. This refers to the narrowing social profile of the social rented sector. \nResidualisation can be observed in several Western European countries, but the \ndevelopments seem to be more dramatic in some countries (e.g. Britain and Germany) \nthan in others (e.g. Denmark and the Netherlands) (see Forrest & Murie, 1983; Forrest \n& Murie, 1988; Meusen & Van Kempen, 1994; Harloe, 1995). Basically, the \nresidualisation concept focuses on housing sectors, but can easily be applied to the \nneighbourhood level. Then residualisation refers to the increasing concentration of \nlower-income households in neighbourhoods with less valued attributes. However, the \nconcept explains only why certain neighbourhoods may experience a decline in the \ncapacity to shape and represent themselves, and does not focus on the (lack of) \n 18\ncapacity itself, i.e. it does not give explicit attention to the issue of neighbourhood \ngovernance.  \n One important scholar here is Power (1997), who emphasises the interaction \nbetween the physical design and layout of a neighbourhood and its social (and \neconomic) conditions. She sees neighbourhood decline primarily in terms of a loss of \nterritorial control, so that the residualisation that is associated with that decline is \nexplicitly linked to the lack of resident capacity to shape the neighbourhood. For \nPower, territorial control has to be regained through the introduction of new forms of \nneighbourhood management, with the support of the residents themselves, and this \ncould be seen as a possible form of neighbourhood co-governance. However, it seems \nto ignore or even disparage the role of existing social networks within (declining) \nneighbourhoods and its conception of neighbourhood management does not quite \nequate with neighbourhood governance as understood in this paper. It is a structural \nexplanation because it takes account of the social pressures arising from economic \ndecline but then it offers merely managerial solutions through what it calls a \u2018local \nrescue focus\u2019 (Power, 1997: 379), which involves interventions to restore \nneighbourhood stability and strong social control (:386-8). Its focus is on shaping \nneighbourhoods through decisive collective action but not on developing the \nrepresentation of those neighbourhoods. The role of governance is recognised only in \nrelation to \u2018central institutions\u2019 (Power, 1997: 392) \u2013 there is no conception of \nrepresentation specifically at the level of a neighbourhood. It talks about \u2018creating a \nsense of control at ground level\u2019 (Power, 1997: 398) but, far from being control by the \ncommunity, this appears to be a form of control of the community, in which the \ncommunity itself is actively involved.  \n 19\nLater research following a similar approach has found that neighbourhood \nregeneration depends not only on the implementation of effective neighbourhood \nmanagement but also on sustained capital investment over long periods, led by \ngovernment and its partners, with residents playing a key role. In addition, other \nchanges in the wider economy and society, particularly rising employment, a buoyant \nhousing market, falling crime and rising educational achievement are influential \n(Tunstall & Coulter, 2006).  \n \nEvaluation of structural approaches to neighbourhood change \nTaken together, what the \u2018structural\u2019 studies show is that housing markets work by \ninstitutionally mediating ecological facts produced by wider socio-economic forces, \nresulting in sub-cultural change. The key line of causation runs from the performance \nof the economy and the state at a macro level to the neighbourhood environment, but \nthis is mediated primarily through housing markets, which are themselves partially \ndetermined by the political economy and partially determine the nature and quality of \nthe neighbourhood environment. However, the housing market is not the only \ninstitution that mediates in this way \u2013 practically any public, private or voluntary \norganisation operating at a meso level in the neighbourhood environment can perform \na similar function (e.g. schools, businesses, local authorities, police forces, health \nauthorities, charities). Moreover, within that environment, social relations not only \ncan exert a reciprocal effect on the housing market and other institutions but also can \ncounteract the effects of the political economy (whether these effects be negative, in \nterms of neighbourhood decline, or positive, in terms of neighbourhood rise) \u2013 cf. the \ndiscussion of Temkin & Rohe (1996) above.  \n 20\nHuman ecology and behavioural approaches are useful for making sense of \nthis complexity, but they have their limitations. This is partly because the \nneighbourhood environment as a whole, as well as each element within that \nenvironment, both affects and is affected by macro-economic and political processes, \nand also affects and is affected by meso-level institutions such as the housing market. \nIn comparison, a structural approach may prove to be more illuminating, with \nneighbourhood change being explained in terms of complex interactions of social, \neconomic and spatial factors. Structural explanations vary, however, according to \nwhich factors are selected and how they are seen to combine and interact. \nConsequently, it is possible to have competing explanations, with no clear way of \ndeciding between them.  \nA common problem with structural approaches is that they tend to subordinate \nagency to structure, that is, they identify factors that can act as causes of \nneighbourhood change, but their accounts of the capacity of action for change are less \nwell developed, e.g. they do not sufficiently explore the potential for social capital \ndevelopment within the neighbourhood or else they do not focus on how that social \ncapital might shape the neighbourhood and form a foundation for its representation \u2013 \nin other words, they do not give sufficient consideration to issues of neighbourhood \ngovernance. Ahlbrandt\u2019s concept of the neighbourhood environment, for example, \ndoes not include factors concerned with the intentional shaping and representation of \nneighbourhoods. Other researchers following a structural approach tend to focus on \none or more of Ahlbrandt\u2019s three factor types, such as economic (Grigsby et al., 1987; \nLupton, 2004), social (Sampson et al., 1997; Green et al., 2005), or spatial (Power, \n1997; Tunstall & Coulter, 2006). Overall, a key factor that structural approaches have \nnot integrated into their theory is that of the capacity of neighbourhood residents (on \n 21\ntheir own or in co-operation with other stakeholders) to shape the neighbourhood and \nrepresent it to others.  \n \nNeighbourhood change and neighbourhood governance \nThe question of the nature and extent of residents\u2019 participation in neighbourhood \ngovernance is crucial because this determines the dominant mode of governance in a \nneighbourhood. A feature of hierarchical governance, for example, is that, if residents \nparticipate in governance at all, it is only tokenistic, in that they have no influence on \nthe key decisions that are taken. For self-governance, in contrast, residents make all \nthe key decisions affecting their neighbourhood (or specific attributes of that \nneighbourhood). In many cases where some form of governance institution exists in a \nneighbourhood, however, we have examples of co-governance, where governmental \nbodies work with residents\u2019 groups in a variety of forums and partnerships. \nResearch (particularly by Ahlbrandt) suggests that residents\u2019 attachment to \ntheir neighbourhood (irrespective of how satisfied or dissatisfied they may be with it) \nis the most important factor associated with their participation in neighbourhood life \ngenerally, and in neighbourhood governance in particular (see, most recently, \nLivingston et al, 2008). In particular it seems that more people are likely to \nparticipate, and to participate more, if their participation is valued (and indeed invited) \nand if they can be confident of the collective as well as individual benefits that their \nparticipation will bring (Simmons & Birchall, 2005). These findings suggest that the \nstructural approach to understanding neighbourhood change needs to be extended to \ncover the effects of policies relating to resident participation, i.e. focusing not just on \nthe collective capacity of residents to achieve change but also on the capacity and \nwillingness of the political system to respond to residents\u2019 needs and aspirations, and \n 22\nspecifically on the absence or presence of civic infrastructure that will facilitate and \nsupport resident-led neighbourhood improvement. In short, understanding \nneighbourhood change requires attention to the capacity of the system to develop \nneighbourhood governance and the orientation of that system towards different modes \nof governance (hierarchical, self- and co-governance). \nIn a number of countries, it has been shown that, when formal opportunities \nfor participation are created (mainly by government) for neighbourhood residents, few \nactually participate (for the UK, see Getimis et al, 2006 and Skidmore et al, 2006; for \nthe Netherlands, Spain and Hungary, see Van Beckhoven et al, forthcoming; for \nEurope generally, see Bull and Jones, 2006, and Keil, 2006). When instruments to \nfacilitate participation are available, neighbourhood characteristics have an enormous \ninfluence on their use - for example, residents\u2019 associations with weak structures, lack \nof such associations, or uncooperative associations can form a barrier to the \ndevelopment of local participation. On the other hand, when formal instruments are \nlacking, a strong association structure or a high level of neighbourhood social \ncohesion can lead residents to develop their own participation instruments. However: \n\u2018The point is that to date relatively little has been done to put mechanisms in place \nthat ensure that all neighbourhoods in a city have the opportunity to develop and \narticulate collective neighbourhood views and to ensure these can be brought together \nat a city-wide level other than through traditional local electoral mechanisms, which \nare increasingly viewed as inadequate\u2019 (Atkinson, 2007: 72). Neighbourhood \ngovernance as understood in this paper therefore remains a largely untapped \npotential.TPF9FPT \n                                                 \nTP\n9\nPT We are of course far from being the first to point out the lack of governance structures and processes \nwithin neighbourhoods and the significance of this lack for community development. For example, \nTaylor (1995, 2000, 2003, 2007) has long argued that such institutions need to be in place if \ndisadvantaged neighbourhoods are to be turned around. What has so far been missing from Taylor\u2019s \n 23\nNeighbourhood governance, or rather the lack of it, could also be responsible \nfor many of the problems found in poorer neighbourhoods in particular. This is \nbecause the absence of legitimate democratic institutions and processes of conflict \nresolution within the neighbourhood can lead to attempts by certain groups to gain \nand maintain control over what they see as their territory or \u2018turf\u2019 by physical force \nand intimidation. This in turn can lead to bitter divisions, conflicts and disorder, \nwhich are found in many of these neighbourhoods (and commented on by, for \nexample, Reynolds, 1986; Walklate & Evans, 1999; Page, 2000; Hancock, 2001; \nBottoms & Wiles, 2002). \nThe effects of different modes of governance on neighbourhood change have \nnot yet been studied in any detail. One way in which co-governance could work, \nhowever, for example as a means to reverse neighbourhood decline, is where a \nneighbourhood democratic authority (such as a commune in France) acts in \npartnership with other organisations responsible for (aspects of) the neighbourhood \nenvironment. Since the partnership has to be reasonably equal in order to ensure that \nthe needs of the neighbourhood are fully recognised, it is necessary for \nneighbourhood governance to be scaled up to higher levels of decision-making, \ntypically at municipal level in the first instance, and for higher levels of political \ngovernance to be scaled down to the neighbourhood level, or as near to it as is \npracticable. This could be achieved through appropriate forms of federation and \nclustering on the one hand, and strategically planned devolution on the other. The \nwhole process, of simultaneously scaling up and scaling down political governance, is \nrequired to ensure that the empowerment of poorer neighbourhoods is real and \n                                                                                                                                            \nanalysis, however, is a clear identification of what kinds of bodies might count as neighbourhood \ngovernance ones, i.e. as both shapers of neighbourhood place and representers of the neighbourhood as \na whole. In general, the literature on community participation is strong on normative questions but \nlacks clear focus on the capacity for resident participation in neighbourhood governance. \n 24\nenduring. Such co-governance between residents and the state would ensure a unity of \nresident \u2018ownership\u2019 and two-way accountability (of the state to the residents and of \nthe residents to the state) (see Somerville, 2009).  \nIn the UK, for example, the New Labour government has been encouraging \nneighbourhood governance, particularly through the New Deal for Communities and \nNeighbourhood Management Pathfinders, and is now progressing this agenda further \n(see, for example, ODPM, 2005; CLG, 2006; CLG, 2008).TPF10FPT A variety of \nneighbourhood governance institutions have been established, and the agenda \ncontains important potential for co-governance (see, for example, Somerville & \nHaines, 2008). As Smith et al. (2007) point out, however, the government has no clear \nconception of neighbourhood or of neighbourhood governance. As yet, not only in the \nUK but also in many other countries, very few initiatives have managed to achieve \nboth a high degree of resident participation and effective representation of residents in \nneighbourhood decision-making (see, for example, Barnes et al., 2007; Atkinson & \nCarmichael, 2007).TPF11FPT  \nOne thing that has become increasingly clear, however, is that, although it can \nand does play a key role, housing governance on its own is incapable of reversing \nneighbourhood decline \u2013 all the major regeneration successes in England such as The \nEldonians, Castle Vale, Royds, Coin Street, and so on, have worked across a number \nof fronts, particularly in creating jobs, building assets, improving health and social \ncare, working with young people, and exercising political leadership on at least a city-\n                                                 \nTP\n10\nPT Much of this, of course, is not neighbourhood governance as we have defined it but neighbourhood \nmanagement or else it is little more than national governance implanted into selected neighbourhoods. \nA discussion of this point, however, would take us beyond the scope of this article. \nTP\n11\nPT The deeper reasons for this badly need to be explored but instead attention now seems to be in the \nprocess of shifting to \u2018citizen-centred governance\u2019 (Barnes et al, 2008 \u2013 see also, Lowndes and \nSullivan, 2008). This sees governance misleadingly in terms of delivering public services rather than \nshaping and representing places or communities, and risks blurring the differences between modes of \ngovernance as defined by Kooiman. Politics seem conspicuous by their absence. This is not to deny \nthat the governance of public services (particularly housing) is very important for neighbourhood \nchange but it should not be confused with the governance of neighbourhoods themselves.  \n 25\nwide, city-region and regional scale. In all these cases, community-based housing \nassociations and\/or cooperatives have been an integral part of the success story but it \nwould be misleading to say that the regeneration has been housing-led. \n \nConclusion \nThe variety of neighbourhood governance is increasing, and this can be interpreted \neither as a problem (e.g. of \u2018fragmentation\u2019) or as a welcome sign of diversity. \nMeasures to give residents greater powers and responsibilities can be seen as \ngenuinely empowering or as increasing the burdens of those who are already \noppressed and over-laden. If the aim is to do the former, then the argument in this \npaper suggests that instruments enabling residents to participate need to be developed \non the neighbourhood scale, taking into account the extent of social cohesion, the \ncomposition of the neighbourhood population, the structure of any residents\u2019 \nassociations, and the extent of the residents\u2019 trust in national or local policy (see also \nVan Beckhoven et al., 2005) \u2013 joining together the links in what Simmons & Birchall \n(2005: 277-8) call the \u2018participation chain\u2019.  \nIn addition, an integrated approach is essential for successful policy outcomes. \nThe tendency to integrate policies is quite strong in European countries, especially in \narea-based policies (policies, for example focused on a single neighbourhood). The \nadvantage of integrated efforts is clear on this spatial level: combinations of problems \ncan be attacked from different angles. However, only when all parties (e.g. local \ngovernment, housing associations, shop owners, inhabitants, private developers) can \ncome to an agreement about the content of the policy, is it possible for success to be \ngenerated (see e.g. Van Kempen & Van Beckhoven, 2006). This is not to say that \nuniversal consensus is required for successful neighbourhood regeneration but only \n 26\nthat there is a need for some kind of decision-making forum at neighbourhood level \nwhere disagreements can be openly debated and conflicts resolved as far as possible. \n Neighbourhood change is caused not only by outside forces, but also by all \nkinds of processes that are more or less internal to the neighbourhood. These \nprocesses relate not only to housing but also to employment, education, transport, \nhealth, crime, public amenities, leisure and recreation, shops, relations within \nhouseholds, etc. Neighbourhood governance is one means by which such processes \ncan be integrated. Without appropriate neighbourhood governance institutions, issues \nof accountability and legitimacy tend to be blurred or confused, with accountability \nupwards to authorities and agencies outside the neighbourhood tending to contradict \nand over-ride accountability to those living and working in the neighbourhood. \nNeighbourhood improvements are at risk of being reversed as traditional vertical lines \nof accountability re-assert themselves, and resources devoted to such improvement \nwill tend to be captured by organisations that are not neighbourhood-based. Even \nwhere a neighbourhood has seemingly declined past the point of no return, it is \narguable that its residents should have the main say in deciding its future, and this can \nonly be safeguarded where appropriate neighbourhood governance structures are in \nplace. The nature of such structures should, so far as possible, be decided through \nopen negotiations with the totality of residents in each neighbourhood, on the basis of \nwhich forms of representation that are acceptable to all residents are most likely to \nemerge. \n \nReferences  \nAalbers, M., Van Beckhoven, E., Van Kempen, R., Musterd, S. & Ostendorf, W. \n(2003) Large Housing Estates in the Netherlands: Overview of Developments in \n 27\nAmsterdam and Utrecht (Utrecht: Faculteit Geowetenschappen Universiteit \nUtrecht).  \nAhlbrandt, R. & Brophy, P.
