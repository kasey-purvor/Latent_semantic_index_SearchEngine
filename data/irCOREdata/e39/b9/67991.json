INTRODUCTION\nDuring the last years group object tracking has been\ninvestigated in various different applications includ-\ning road traffic systems, military surveillance and in\nparticular for ground moving target indicator (GMTI)\ntracking [1] and robotics applications [2]\u2013[5].\nGroups of targets can be considered as formations\nof entities whose number varies over time because\ntargets can enter a scene, or disappear at random times.\nThe groups can split, merge, to be relatively near to\neach other or move largely independently on each\nother. However, it is typical for group formations to\nmaintain some patterns of movement [6] and hence the\nmethods for group tracking differ from the methods of\nThis paper was submitted August 2008, revised October 2009,\nApril 2010 and September 2010.\nstandard multiple-target tracking. Although individual\ntargets in the group can exhibit independent movement\nat a certain level, overall the group will move as one\nwhole, synchronising the movement of the individual\nentities and avoiding collisions. In most of the multi-\ntarget tracking methods, as opposed to groups tracking\nmethods, tracking of individual objects is the common\napproach. However, there are strong motivations to\nmodel and to study the behaviour of groups. One\nmotivation is the ability to statistically infer which\ntracks are moving in formation or are having common\nmovement. We may also want to detect events inside\ngroups (splitting) and between groups (merging). This\ninformation fits well with a number of modern multi-\ntarget tracking applications where one may want to\ndifferentiate friendly objects from enemies or to predict\nthe intention, destination and future manoeuvres of\ntargets. Moreover, another strong motivation for group\ntracking is in the possibility of using common informa-\ntion about the group to improve the estimation of the\nobjects\u2019 individual states. For instance, in case of low\ndetection probabilities and\/or very noisy environments,\nby modeling the targets\u2019 interactions inside groups,\nthe detection of stealthy targets can be facilitated [7].\nA further motivation is that a user may be unable\nto assimilate information relating to large numbers of\nindividual objects. Group object estimation makes it\npossible, for such a user, to detect events or focus on\nparticular groups with interesting behaviour. Finally, an\nadditional motivation is to consider common applica-\ntions where objects have multiple parts, each of which\ngenerates detections (e.g. when multiple radar scatters\nexist in a single extended object). In many cases group\nobject tracking is the only applicable approach, for\ninstance when tracking thousands of targets that may\nnot be possible to be individually tracked [8]. Rescuing\npeople in earthquakes, floods and disaster events also\nnecessitate approaches where the whole group motion\nis monitored instead of the motion of each individual\nperson.\n2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, REGULAR PAPER, VOL. A, NO. SEPTEMBER, 2010\nIn [9] the benefit of group object tracking over indi-\nvidual object tracking is demonstrated over simulated\nand real data in terms of estimation accuracy. The\ninteractions between group members are modelled by\nrepulsive forces. In these classes of problems, group\nmodeling offers a natural solution.\nDifferent models of groups of objects have been\nproposed in the literature, such as particle models for\nflocks of birds [10]\u2013[12], and leader-follower models\n[6]. However, estimating the dynamic evolution of the\ngroup structure has not been widely studied in the\nliterature, although there are similarities with methods\nused in evolving network models [13], [14].\nMethods for group object tracking also vary widely:\nfrom Kalman filtering approaches, Joint Probability\nData Association (JPDA) [15], [16] to Probability Hy-\npothesis Density (PHD) filtering [17]\u2013[19], and others\n[20]\u2013[24]. The influence of the \u2018negative\u2019 informa-\ntion on group object tracking is considered in [25]\nand ground moving target indicator tracking based on\nparticle filtering in [1]. In [19] a coordinated group\ntracking model is presented, comprising a continuous-\ntime motion of the group and a group structure tran-\nsition model. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nparticle filter algorithm is proposed to approximate the\nposterior probability density function (PDF) of the high\ndimensional state.\nMahler [6] outlines that careful group target motion\nmodels should be able to describe target appearance\nand disappearance, not just for the motion of individual\ntargets and the degree to which targets jointly move in\na coordinated manner.\nInspired by some ideas from [13], we consider\nthe groups of objects as evolving undirected random\ngraphs. The novelty of this paper is in the proposed\napproach for estimating the group structure jointly with\nthe group target states using a graphical representation.\nWith this graphical representation, objects are not as-\nsigned to groups but are connected to one another. This\nenables the cohesion of a group to be precisely mod-\neled. The main contributions for this work consist in:\ni) the developed graphical representation of the group\nstructure, ii) a second graphical model is developed\nfor the groups which gives information about mutually\ninteracting groups and that is also used in the data\nassociation algorithm, iii) finally, target state estimates\n(from the designed Monte Carlo methods) within the\nsame group or within interacting groups are compared\nin order to update the graph.\nThe remaining parts of this paper are organised as\nfollows. Section II presents the evolving network mod-\nels. Section IV formulates the group object tracking\nproblem jointly with the proposed evolving network\nmodel for the groups. Section VI presents results with\nsimulated data and from real GMTI radar measure-\nments, with measurement origin uncertainty. Finally,\nconclusions are given in Section VII.\nII. EVOLVING NETWORK MODELS\nThe evolution of complex network structures has\nbeen studied in the light of different problems, such\nas complex networks in communications, biology, so-\ncial sciences, economics and Internet (see, e.g., the\nsurveys [13], [14]). Graph theory represents natural\nways of modeling these network structures. Within this\ngraphical family, random graphs introduced in the early\nsixty by Erdos and Renyi [26] are the first approach\nattempting to model these complex evolving networks.\nA random graph of size n is simply obtained by\nstarting with a set of n vertices and by adding randomly\nedges between them. In the first model proposed in\n[26], every possible edge in the graph occurs with a\nchosen common probability. After several studies and\ngeneralisation on random graph network theory, recent\nresearch in networks has been focussed on more sophis-\nticated evolving dynamic systems. The main difference\nstems from the necessity to continuously change the\nsize of the graph (e.g., due to addition of new nodes or\nremoval of nodes). Another major difference is in the\nprobabilities associated to the creation of new edges.\nFor instance, when adding a new node, instead of\nusing a random process with an equal probability for\nthe generation of new edges, a preferential creation\nof edges can be computed. The preferential strategy\nof adding edges is based on the assumption that a\nnode with a higher impact in the graph network has\na higher probability to be connected to new nodes\nthan a second node with less impact. For instance, for\na research community network, an article with many\ncitations has more chances to be cited than a paper\nwith few citations.\nThe flexible approach of evolving graphs fits well\nto the problem of group object tracking. The closest\napplication to the group modelling task is the World-\nWide Web (WWW) network representing a large dy-\nnamic network where nodes and links are continuously\ncreated and removed [13]. However, the network char-\nacterising the group object evolution is obviously more\ndynamic than the WWW network where the effects of\nremoved links between nodes are often negligible. A\nsignificant novelty in the evolving group object network\nthat we develop is that the targets have dynamical\nspatial constraints. The preferential approach is con-\nsequently irrelevant for the group tracking problem\nand more appropriate evolving models need to be\nintroduced.\nIn this paper we extend concepts of evolving network\nmodels to group object network in Section III. A graph-\nical representation models the connections between\ntargets. At each time step new nodes are added, existing\nnodes are removed and the set of edges is updated.\nIII. AN EVOLVING NETWORK MODEL FOR GROUP\nMOTION ESTIMATION\nOne of the challenges in group object tracking is in\nthe necessity of updating the group structure and mod-\nGROUP OBJECT STRUCTURE AND STATE ESTIMATION WITH EVOLVING NETWORKS AND MONTE CARLO METHODS 3\neling the interactions between separate components.\nFor this purpose adding components to the groups,\nremoving others, splitting and merging groups are of\nprimary importance.\nIn our paper, Gt is chosen to be an evolving\nundirected random graph representing both the targets\nwithin the groups (nodes in the graph) and some rela-\ntions between the group members, which is reflected by\nthe edges between the related graph nodes. Symmetric\ncriteria as distance and velocity are used to create an\nedge. However, other criteria can be applied.\nA. Graphical Representation for the Group Object\nStructure\nConsider N targets constituting the set of vertices\nfv1; : : : ;vNg. Each vertex vi is associated with the\ntarget state and with the target state\u2019s corresponding\nvariance. The set of edges linking the set of vertices\nis denoted by E. The graph structure can then be\ndenoted by G = (fv1; : : : ;vNg; E). One edge, in E,\nbetween two nodes vi and vj is denoted by (vi;vj). In\norder to characterise the presence or absence of a link\n(edge) between two nodes, the distance between these\ntwo considered nodes is calculated, e.g., by the Maha-\nlanobis distance criterion. The Mahalanobis distance\nis computed from the estimated positions and from\nthe velocities of the separate objects. This estimated\ndistance is thresholded and a decision is made about the\nconnections. In this representation a group corresponds\nto a connected component of the graph structure. Note\nthat, two nodes are in the same connected component if\nand only if a path between them exists. In the following\nsections, the groups in Gt are denoted fg1; : : : ; gnGg,\nwhere the groups gi are the connected components of\nG and nG is the number of groups in G.\nIn [19],Gt represents a set of group\u2019s labels for each\ntarget. For example, with five targets, Gt = [1 1 2 2 2]\nmeans that targets 1 and 2 are in group 1 and tar-\ngets 3, 4 and 5 are in group 2. With the graphical\nrepresentation, one similar group structure is: Gt =\n(fv1;v2;v3;v4;v5g; f(v1;v2); (v3;v4); (v3;v5)g)\nand the groups correspond to the connected compo-\nnents of the graph Gt.\nB. Motivations for the Group Object Structure Graph-\nical Representation\nThe approach proposed in this paper builds up a\ndynamical evolution model instead of using transition\nprobabilities in the space of possible group structures\n(e.g., see Figure 1).\nAlgorithms of adding components to the groups,\nremoving others, splitting and merging groups by\ntaking into account geometric distances and velocity\ndistances between the groups and between the targets\nare proposed.\nIn [19] the approach with transition probabilities is\nfollowed. In contrast with [19], an evolution model\nx1\n, x2\nx3\nx1\n, x3\nx2\nx1\n, x2\nx3\nx1\n, x2\n, x3\nx2\n, x3\nx1\nx3\nx1\nx2\nG\n1\nG\n1\nG\n5\nG\n4\nG\n3\nG\n2\npi1,1 pi1,2\npi1,3\npi1,4\npi1,5\nx1\n, x2\nx3\nG\nt-1\nx1\n, x3\nx2\nG\nt\nEvolution model\nG\nt\n=  f (x1, x2 , x3, Gt-1)\nFig. 1.

At each time instant, based on the\ndecision made about birth and death targets, nodes are\ncreated or removed inside a group. For each removed\nnode, all its links to other nodes are deleted, and for\neach new node, respective links to neighbour nodes\nare added. Similarly, when an object passes from one\ngroup to another, the respective links (edges) in the\nconsidered graph disappear, and one or more links will\nappear in the graph of the other group which the object\njoins.\nA strong motivation for such graphical representation\nis illustrated in Figure 2. The graphical representation\nallows an easy switch in the group structure space:\nremoving or adding only one edge can change the\ngroup structure.\nA further motivation is illustrated in Figure 3 which\nshows two groups g1 and g2 with the same nodes\nfv1; : : : ;v4g. These two groups are identical if con-\nsidered as a set of indexes. When propagating these\ntwo groups, using the graph representation, g2 is more\nlikely to split than g1. The graph representation, allows,\nthus, to propagate more information than a vector of\ngroup indexes for each target.\nC. Evolving Graph Models\nThe aim is to determine an evolution model Gt =\nf(Gt\u00001;Xt) for the group structure, for time t > 0\nand an initialisation process G0 = f(X0) for t = 0.\n4 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, REGULAR PAPER, VOL.

Graph Initialisation- Model fI\nIn this Section, we assume that, at time t = 0, the\nnumber of targets and their respective states are known,\ngiven by one of the detection techniques from [16]. Let\nus consider N targets constituting the set of vertices\nfv1; : : : ;vNg. Each vertex vi is associated with the\ntarget state x0;i at time t = 0, as well as the target\nstate\u2019s corresponding variance matrix P 0;i. Model 1,\ngiven below describes the proposed edge initialisation\nmethod where E0 is the set of edges linking the set\nof vertices fv1; : : : ;vNg. Initially E0 is the empty set\nf?g. The Mahalanobis distance di;k between vertices\nvi and vk is calculated and we evaluate whether it ex-\nceeds a chosen decision threshold \". The edge between\nnodes vi and vk is denoted by (i; k). Using Model 1,\nModel 1.fI -The Edge Creation Process.\nE0 = f?g\nFOR i = 1; : : : ; N \u0000 1\nFOR k = i+ 1; : : : ; N\nCALCULATE di;k\nIF di;k < \", E0 = E0 [ f(i; k)g\nEND\nEND\nEND\nthe initial graph structure G0 = (fv1; : : : ;vNg; E0) is\nthen obtained.\nE. Edge Updating- Model fEU\nThe evolving graph of group of targets is more dy-\nnamic than those studied in the literature [13]. Existing\nedges should be updated at each time instant since\nthe graph structure is related with the dynamic spatial\nconfiguration. In a straightforward way, Model 1 can\nrecalculate the distance between any pair of nodes.\nHowever, the computational complexity can be reduced\nwhen some information about group centres (means,\ncovariances and the distances between them) is used.\nFor each group g we define its centre Og = 1ng\nX\nvk\u000fg\nxgk\nand its corresponding average covariance matrix P g =\n1\nng\nX\nvk\u000fg\nP gk where ng is defined as the number of\ntargets in g. The centre and covariance matrix of each\ngroup can be characterised differently, e.g., based on a\nmixture of Gaussian components.\nUsing the Mahalanobis distance criterion, an ap-\npropriate threshold \"0 >> \", and based on Model\n1, a second graph G0 = (fv01; : : : ;v0nGg; E0) can be\nintroduced with nodes v0i being characterised by their\nposition Ogi . A couple of connected nodes in the set\nE0 can be interpreted as two groups that can possi-\nbly have interactions (exchange of targets). Model 2\nsummarises the edge updating process between neigh-\nbouring groups. The graph G0 will also be used in the\nnode incorporation process.\nGROUP OBJECT STRUCTURE AND STATE ESTIMATION WITH EVOLVING NETWORKS AND MONTE CARLO METHODS 5\nModel 2. fEU -Edges Updating Process.\nFOR i = 1; : : : ; nG \u0000 1\nAPPLY Model 1\nto the set of nodes in gi and update E\nFOR k = i+ 1; : : : ; nG\nIF edge (i; k) 2 E0\nFOR each node in group gi,\nCALCULATE the distance\nto each node in group gk\nCOMPARE with \" and update E\nEND\nEND\nEND\ni = nG APPLY Model 1\nto the set of nodes in gi and update E\nModel 2 can be illustrated using the example from\nFigure 4.

Further-\nmore, in Figure 4 (c), for any couple of groups (gi, gj)\nconnected in graph G0 (in this example, only g1 and\ng2 are connected). The distances between any couple\nof nodes (vi, vj), chosen respectively in groups gi and\ngj , are calculated. The use of Model 2, in this example,\navoids calculations of distances between nodes in g3\nand nodes in g1 and g2, respectively.\nF. New Node Incorporation-Model fNI\nClassical approaches rely on either random or pref-\nerential approaches (the mixture of the two also exists)\nin order to assign edges to the new nodes. Additionally,\nin classical graph techniques, the number of new edges\nassigned to each new node is fixed. The approach\nproposed in this paper differs from the above mentioned\ntechniques. For the purposes of group tracking, the\nModel 3. fNI - Incorporation of new nodes.\nConsider group i = 1\nNodeNearGroup = false\nDO\nCALCULATE dnew;i\nIF dnew;i < \"00\nNodeNearGroup = true\nFOR each node in gi,\nCALCULATE the distance\nbetween vnew and each node in gi\nCOMPARE with \" and update E\nEND\nFOR k = i+ 1 : : : nG\nIF edge (i; k) 2 E0\nCALCULATE the distance\nbetween vnew and each node in gk\nCOMPARE with \" and update E\nEND\nEND\ni = i+ 1\nWHILE(i = nG + 1 or NodeNearGroup = true)\ndistance calculated based on the interaction criterion\nshould be used to create edges with the existing nodes\nand the number of edges is then determined by the\nnodes\u2019 spatial configuration. Consider a new node (ver-\ntex) denoted as vnew and its state xnew. Depending on\nthe state xnew and in comparison with the existing nG\nnodes, new edges have to be created. A simple way is to\nevaluate the criterion for the interaction between every\npair (vnew;vi). In order to optimise the computational\ntime, the graphG0 defined in Section III-E can be used.\nModel 3 shows the edge updating process when\nincorporating a new node, where dnew;i is the Ma-\nhalanobis distance between vnew and Ogi (dnew;i =\nMahalanobis-distance ((xnew;P new); ( 1ngi\nX\nvk\u000fgi\nxgik ;\n1\nngi\nX\nvk\u000fgi\nP gik )); the fixed threshold \"\n00 > \" introduced\nin order to see whether the new node vnew is interact-\ning with a node in a group g.\nLet us illustrate Model 3 using the example from\nFigure 5. The considered graph contains 4 groups of\n14 nodes. In Figure 5 (a), by introducing the centre of\neach group, the graph G0 is represented: it contains 4\nnodes, corresponding to the centre of each group, and\ntwo edges between, respectively, g1 and g2 and g3 and\ng4. Distances dnew;i between the new node vnew and\ncentres of groups Oi are computed. The principle of\nModel 3 is to calculate distances dnew;i until finding\none neighbour group of node vnew according to a\nthreshold \"00 or until reaching the last index i (i = nG).\nNote that \"00 is chosen such that \"00 << \"0 so that a\nnew node close to one group g according the threshold\n\"00 is far from any group that is not connected with g\naccording to the threshold \"0.\nFor the example presented on Figure 5, g1 and g2\nare not neighbours of vnew according to the distance\ncriterion. In contrast, g3 satisfies the distance criterion.\nThen, the calculated distances of Model 3, used to\nupdate graph G, are illustrated.

Old Node Suppression-Model fNS\nThis is the simplest graphical evolution modeling\npart and consists of removing death targets by remov-\ning corresponding nodes and their related edges. A\ntarget in the graph will be removed if the measurements\ndo not contain any information about it after a certain\nperiod of time.\nIV. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nConsider the problem of tracking the motion of\ngroups of targets. Each target i is characterised by its\nstate vector xt;i = (xt;i; _xt;i; yt;i; _yt;i)0 (comprising the\npositions xt;i, yt;i and velocities _xt;i, _yt;i in x and y\ndirections respectively); 0 denotes the transpose oper-\nation. Targets which are close to one another tend to\nform a group. The Mahalanobis distance di;k is chosen\nas a criterion of closeness between the targets within a\ngroup. At each time instant t, the set of objects tracked\nin a group g can be modeled by a Random Finite Set\n(RFS, see [6]) that incorporates the state vectors of the\ngroup members, Xgt =\n\b\nxgt;1;x\ng\nt;2; : : : ;x\ng\nt;ng\n\t\n(ng\nis the random size of group g). Knowing the group\nstructure Gt = fg1; : : : ; gnGg (nG is the number of\ngroups), the joint state for the all the targets in the nG\ngroups has the expression Xt = fXg1t ; : : : ;X\ngnG\nt g.\nAt time t a measurement vector zt is received which\ncan be described as a function of the state Xt =\nfXg1t ; : : : ;X\ngnG\nt g. Assuming that the measurement\nlikelihood function p(ztjXt) can be calculated, the\npurpose is to compute sequentially the state PDF for\neach group of objects. The changes of the groups such\nas merging and splitting are taken into account during\nthe graph update process. Additionally, the groups\u2019\nmovements are assumed independent.\nUnder the Markovian assumption for the state tran-\nsition, the Bayesian prediction and filtering steps can\nbe written as follows:\np(Xt;GtjZ1:t\u00001) = p(GtjXt;Z1:t\u00001)\u0002 p(XtjZ1:t\u00001)\n=\nR\np(GtjXt;Gt\u00001)\u0002\np(XtjXt\u00001;Gt\u00001)p(Xt\u00001;Gt\u00001jZ1:t\u00001)dXt\u00001dGt\u00001; (2)\np(Xt;GtjZ1:t) = p(ztjXt;Gt)\u0002 p(Xt;GtjZ1:t\u00001)\np(ztjZ1:t\u00001) ; (3)\nwhere Z1:t is the set of measurements up to time t and\nzt is the current vector of measurements.\nThe transition PDF p(GtjXt;Gt\u00001) of the group\nstructure can be calculated knowing the prediction\nof the target state and group structure in the pre-\nvious time instant, and using the graph evolution\nmodel introduced in Section III-C. The transition PDF\np(XtjXt\u00001;Gt\u00001) of the state of all targets is cal-\nculated knowing the previous time target states and\ngroup structure PDF p(Xt\u00001;Gt\u00001jZ1:t\u00001). With the\nassumption of independence between group motions,\nthe PDF p(XtjXt\u00001;Gt\u00001) can be decomposed in the\nfollowing supplementary equation\np(XtjXt\u00001;Gt\u00001) =\nY\ngi2Gt\u00001\np(X\ngi\nt jXgit\u00001); (4)\nwhere p(Xgit jXgit\u00001) is the transition density of the set\nof targets from the group gi.\nIn order to perform the correction step, the likelihood\nfunction p(ztjXt;Gt) of the whole state has to be\nevaluated by means of a data association approach. In\nthis paper, the JPDA algorithm [16] is used to resolve\nthe measurement origin uncertainty.\nIn addition, in the gating process in the JPDA\nalgorithm is enhanced by using other information\nabout the graph structure, such as the distance between\ngroups. Figure 5 shows an example where groups g3\nand g4 can be considered separately from groups g1\nand g2. Note that the graph G\n0\nt estimated at each\ntime instant is applied in the edge updating process\nand in the nodes incorporation steps which leads\nto reduction of the data association computations.\nAt each time step, the graph G0t can also be used\nin the gating process. Indeed groups of the same\ngraph G0t\u2019s connected component can be gathered in\nseparate data association process: the graph G0t offers\na straightforward method of clustering the targets for\nthe data association process.\nDenote by fg01; : : : ; g0nG0g, the set of nG0 connected\ncomponents in graph G0. Any connected component\ng0i can model a set of groups that are close enough\nGROUP OBJECT STRUCTURE AND STATE ESTIMATION WITH EVOLVING NETWORKS AND MONTE CARLO METHODS 7\nto be treated in the same data association algorithm.\nUnder the independence assumption between the g0i,\nthe following equation (5) can be written\np(ztjXt;Gt) = p(ztjXt;Gt;G0t)\n=\nQ\ni=1;:::;nG0\np(z\ng0i\nt jXg\n0\ni\nt\u00001); (5)\nwhere Xg\n0\ni\nt\u00001 is the set of targets\u2019 states belonging to\nthe groups in g0i. The vector z\ngi\nt comprises the subset\nof measurements related with the group in g0i. For\nexample, zgit can be chosen by gating measurements\nusing the set of targets state Xg\n0\ni\nt\u00001.\nA. Model of Individual Targets\nThe nearly constant velocity model [27], [28] is used\nfor the update of each node of the graph, i.e., for\nmodelling the motion of each target within a group.\nIn two dimensions, the state of the ith target is given\nby:\nxt;i = Axt\u00001;i + \u0000\u0011t\u00001; (6)\nwhere A = diag(A1;A1), A1 =\n\u0012\n1 T\n0 1\n\u0013\n, \u0000 =\u0012\nT=2 1 0 0\n0 0 T=2 1\n\u00130\n, T is the sampling interval\nand \u0011t\u00001 is the system dynamics noise. In order to\ncover a wide range of motions, the velocity should be\napproximately constant over straight line trajectories\nand the velocity change should be abrupt at each turn\n(especially for the direction of the velocity). Then, the\nsystem dynamics noise \u0011t\u00001 is represented as a sum\nof two Gaussian components\np(\u0011t\u00001) = \u000bN (0;Q1) + (1\u0000 \u000b)N (0;Q2); (7)\nQ1=diag(\u001b\n2; \u001b21), Q2=diag(\u001b\n2; \u001b22); \u001b is a standard\ndeviation assumed common and constant for x and y;\n\u001b1 \u001c \u001b2 are standard deviations allowing to model\nrespectively smooth and abrupt changes in the velocity.\nThe fixed coefficient \u000b has values in the interval [0; 1].\nIn addition, to model the interaction between objects\nin each group, the average velocity of group objects\nis used in (6) instead of the velocity of each group\ncomponent. For each group g, in the group structure G\nand for each xgt;i 2Xgt =\n\b\nxgt;1;x\ng\nt;2; : : : ;x\ng\nt;ng\n\t\nwe have the following equation\nxgt;i = x\ng\nt\u00001;i +\nngP\nj=1\n(Bxgt\u00001;j) + \u0000\u0011t\u00001; (8)\nwhere and B = diag(B1;B1) with B1 =\u0012\n0 Tng\n0 0\n\u0013\n. More sophisticated models can be con-\nsidered to model targets\u2019 interactions in each group\nsuch as the developed in [19].\nB. Observation Model\nRange and bearing observations from a network\nof low cost sensors positioned along the road are\nconsidered as measurements. The measurement vector\nzt;i for the ith target contains the range rt;i to each\ntarget and the bearing \ft;i. The measurement equation\nis of the form:\nzt;i = h(xt;i) +wt;i; (9)\nwhere h is the nonlinear function\nh(xt;i) =\n\u0012q\nx2t;i + y\n2\nt;i; tan\n\u00001 yt;i\nxt;i\n\u0013\n(10)\nand the measurement noise wt;i is supposed to be\nGaussian, with a known covariance matrix R.\nC. Particle Filtering Algorithms for Group Motion\nEstimation\nIn this paper, two approaches are proposed. The\nimpact of incorporating or not the group structure in\nthe state is studied, also from the point of view of its\ncomputational complexity. One way of considering the\ngroup structure is to propagate, at each time step, a\ndeterministic group structure using the previous group\nstructure Gt\u00001 and the current estimate of all the\ntarget states denoted by cXt, i.e., Gt = f(Gt\u00001;cXt).\nAlthough the complexity of such an approach is re-\nduced, it does not provide information about the group\nstructure uncertainty. This group structure evolution\nmodel has been introduced in [29].\nIn contrast, by considering an augmented state (in-\nstead of Xt, the state is now (Xt;Gt)), the group\nstructure uncertainty can be accounted for in a better\nway. This group structure evolution model with an aug-\nmented state has been studied in [30]. In the next two\nsubsections, particle filtering algorithms are presented\ncombined with these two approaches.\n1) Deterministic Update of the Graph Structure:\nWe denote byNp the number of particles and L is the\ncurrent index of a particle. Having in mind equations\n(2)-(5), the implemented algorithm is described as\nAlgorithm 1, where the proposal PDF is of the form:\nqgi(X\ngi\nt jXgi;(L)0:t\u00001 ; z0:t\u00001) = p(Xgit jXgi;(L)t\u00001 ) (where\np(X\ngi\nt jXgi;(L)t\u00001 ) is the transition PDF, for the target\u2019s\nstate in the group gi, under the assumption that the\ninteraction between targets is with respect to the\ngroup structure Gt\u00001). In order to sample from this\ntransition PDF, a nearly constant velocity model (6)\nis used for each component Xgi;(L)t\u00001 of the particle\nX\n(L)\nt\u00001 to obtain X\ngi;(L)\nt .\nJPDA Combined with the Estimated Group Structure\nIn step 2 of Algorithm 1, the data association problem\nis resolved by the JPDA algorithm [16].

These\nthreshold values are very sensitive to the elements\nof the estimated covariance matrix for each target. A\nsuitable choice of these parameters is necessary to\navoid gatherings of two targets, with big difference\nin their speed or position, in the same group.

However, the computational\ncomplexity is increased substantially (approximately 3\ntimes more) compared with the PF without the MH step\nand with deterministic update of the graph structure.\nThe computational time for on time step (1s) are in av-\nerage, respectively, 220ms for the deterministic update\nand 500ms for the second approach. Both approaches\nsatisfy the real time constraint for these simulations\nwith Matlab.\nThe approach with the augmented state can model\nwell the group structure uncertainty and hence, gives\nmore robust performance.\n12 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, REGULAR PAPER, VOL.

The validation is performed over\nreal GMTI radar data shown in Figure VI provided to\nus by QinetiQ, UK. Two groups of targets are moving\non the ground by crossing their paths which constitutes\nan additional ambiguity for the group tracking algo-\nrithm. The GMTI measurements are obtained by an\nembedded radar on a moving airborn platform. There\nis a measurement origin uncertainty which requires the\nsolution of the data association problem.\nAs seen from Figure VI, there is clutter noise in the\nmeasured bearing angles and measured distances to the\ntargets.\nThe developed approach provides good estimation\naccuracy of each vehicle trajectory positions (see Fig-\nure 20). Figure 21 shows additionally that the estimated\nx coordinates of the groups are close to x coordinates\ncalculated from the measurements.

CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper presents Monte Carlo techniques\nfor group object structure and state estimation.\nEvolutionary graph network-type models for the group\nstructure are proposed. The graph structure can be\ndeterministically estimated or in a probabilistic way\nwith a graph jointly updated with the samples of the\nparticle filter. The core idea is to maintain the structure\nof a graph in which connected components correspond\nto groups of targets. The effectiveness of the proposed\ntechniques is investigated and validated over a\nchallenging urban environment scenario with splitting,\nmerging and crossing of groups. The performance of\nthe approach is also validated over real ground moving\ntarget indicator data sets. The proposed approaches\nsuccessfully estimate the targets states and the group\nstructure graph with reliable performance and accurate\ntracking.\nAcknowledgements.
