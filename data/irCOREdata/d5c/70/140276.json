This is a revised paper previously presented at the 21st IPMA\nWorld Congress on Project Management Cracow, Poland.\nKeywords: complex project management, competency standards, major projects,\nIntroduction\nFads and fashions in management are well understood phenomena [1]. Project Management\n(PM) could itself be described as \u2018currently fashionable\u2019, given the level of interest in the area.\nOn the one hand, PM is recognized to be the key enabler of business change and a vital\ncontributor to future business success [2]. On the other, projects commonly fail to meet their\nobjectives [3-5]. What are project managers and their organizations to do to resolve this\ndissonance? One organizational response to this is to seek increased levels of certainty of\nperformance through the application of recognised competencies and standards [6]. Significant\nnumbers of Project Managers have gained certification to the existing PM standards (e.g. PMI,\nAPM, PRINCE2) and more recently to the Program Standards, ProgM (PMI) and Managing\nSuccessful Programmes (from the UK\u2019s Office of Government Commerce).\nA recent addition to the list of professional organisations is the College of Complex Project\nManagers (CCPM) who have developed their own standard. This new standard has emerged and\nappears to have gained momentum unchecked by any critical debate. The Competency\nStandards for Complex Project Managers (CSCPM)) holds little back on its claims. \u201cThis\nstandard lays the foundation for project management to effectively deal with complex projects,\nand in doing so, to add real value to our world.\u201d [7]\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a discussion starter on the professional development\nissues raised by this development, to examine this phenomenon and the associated claims, and to\nprovide a development of the critical debate concerning its utility and implications for the\npractice of PM. The outcome is a set of recommendations for how the debate can be progressed\nthrough grounded research.\nThe paper is structured around three main issues. The first concerns the nature of complex and\ncomplexity being discussed. The approach used by the College and the standard are compared\nwith existing approaches. Secondly, the process by which the College and standard has emerged\nis examined. Lastly, the content of the standard and its implications are discussed.\nThe nature of complexity and the complex project manager\n\"Every decade or so, a grandiose theory comes along, bearing similar aspirations and\noften brandishing an ominous-sounding C-name. In the 1960 it was cybernetics. In the\n'70s it was catastrophe theory. Then came chaos theory in the '80s and complexity\ntheory in the '90s\" [8].\nProject managers have a wide and diverse set of applications for the term \u2018complex\u2019 [9], without\ndrawing distinctions between complex and complicated, for instance. Some unpacking of the\nterm is useful however, to allow more specific examination of relevant aspects of complexity\ntheory.\nComplexity theory has been liberally applied over the last decade in many disciplines as\ndisparate as astronomy, biology, physics and finance in an attempt to solve complex problems\n[10]. Much theory building and modelling of complex systems has taken place from which we\nmay make successful predictions about the real world, but very few practical tools have been\ndeveloped to manage or control complex systems. Traditional methods are often the only option\nhumans have to muster some sort of control of complex systems, and these predominate in the\nPM literature [11].\nA complex system is a system formed out of many components whose behaviour is emergent.\nThat is to say that the behaviour of a complex system cannot be simply inferred from the\nbehaviour of its components [12]. Examples of complex systems include human civilisation,\ngovernments, families, the human body (physiological), a person (psychosocial), the brain, the\necosystem of the world and sub-world ecosystems: desert, rainforest, ocean, and forest fires,\ntraffic jams, the weather, the spread of infectious disease and infectious ideas [12, 13]. The term\n\u2018complexity\u2019 (the suffix \u2013ity being used to express a state or condition) is best defined as a\nquestion. How complex is it? An answer would be, its complexity is <some metric>. This\ndefinition makes a connection between the condition of a complex system and our understanding\nof it. Complexity therefore, is a measure of the inherent difficulty to achieve the desired\nunderstanding of a complex system. Or alternatively stated it is the amount of information\nnecessary to describe a complex system [12].\nManagerial Complexity in the project environment comes not only from individual structural\nelements (categorised as being external stakeholders, task characteristics and organisational\ncomplexity) and their interaction, but also from the dynamic effects of each of these changing\nand then interacting as they change, causing further change in other parts of the system [9]. A\nmodel of this complexity is shown as a Structural Dynamic Interaction (SDI) matrix in Fig. 1\nSo what does complex mean in PM? A review of the subject has been published recently which\nassists the development of this debate [14]. In practice, common synonyms for the term complex\nare difficult, complicated, intricate, involved, tangled, and knotty, to name but a few. Commonly\nthe PM literature uses the term loosely, for instance when describing the \u201cweb of relationships\u201d\namong project stakeholders that need to be managed (e.g. [15]). Projects themselves have been\ndescribed as complex systems that require management [7, 16, 17], not only because they deal\nwith technological issues but because they deal with the wider organizational factors largely\nbeyond the project manager\u2019s control [18]. Using the SDI matrix, we can say that they are truly\ncomplex where they exist in stage 4 \u2013 they have multiple structural elements interacting and\nchanging as they progress. This precludes many projects, including very large ones, where they\nmay have very high levels of structural complexity, but due to stability in other conditions, do\nnot have the dynamic interaction complexity. A question that arises from this discussion is the\n<metric> that would apply to a project to put it into the complex (stage 4) category. This has not\ncurrently been established and is required to provide some threshold to the inevitable notion that\nmost projects possess some degree of complexity. Thus complexity is a variable rather than a\nbinary commodity, and without measures for it, is a term that is less than helpful, particularly\nwhen being used to prescribe what is and is not a complex project.\nIn addition to this, it is notable that projects are socially constructed entities [19, 20], and so can\nbe described as complex adaptive systems. Indeed, there are many notions of complexity,\ndescribing projects in terms of complexity landscapes, for instance.\nA case of mistaken identity\nWith the above in mind, we now consider the approach taken to complexity by the College and\nthe standard.\nSection 3 of the CSCPM [7] defines the characteristics of complex projects. It uses the language\nof complexity science such as open, dynamic, recursive, non-linear feedback, and emergent,\nhowever these are not the characteristics of the projects cited in the definition. A game of chess\nis used to exemplify dynamic complexity where parts of the system can react and interact.\nHowever, chess is a two player, time and turn based game, with a clear set of deterministic rules.\nThe system is not open. It is played on a square board of eight rows and eight columns, and each\nplayer begins with an identical set of sixteen pieces; king, queen, two rooks, and so on. Extra\nsquares never emerge, and when two pawns are next to each other they do not turn into a jester\nwith a whole new set of movement rules. Each player\u2019s move ultimately focuses on capturing\ntheir opponent\u2019s king. Each chess piece has a well defined set of rules concerning how it moves\nand how it can capture other pieces. The movements of each piece cannot be described as\ndynamic or emergent. Consider the king, a piece that can only move one square any which way\nat a time. Once in every game the king is allowed a special move known as castling. The novice\nor non-player might describe the king\u2019s behaviour as complex, but those well versed in the game\nof chess consider the behaviour knowable \u2013 complicated (predicting when in time castling\noccurs) maybe, but still predictable because only a limited number of moves are technically\npossible. The behaviour is still not non-linear or emergent when a player\u2019s pawn advances to its\neighth rank and gets promoted to a queen, rook, or knight of the same colour (almost always to a\nqueen) because this behaviour is still deterministic \u2013 it is causally determined by an unbroken\nchain of prior moves.\nSimply having unforeseen events that occurred during daily project work activities is not\nevidence of a complex system. Unforeseen events are inevitable to some degree in almost all\nprojects. Therefore without defining the level and the challenges of complexity, it is\nunsupportable to claim that \u201ca completely new way of managing is required to control these\nunforeseen events\u201d. Uncertainty is a fundamental characteristic of all projects, as most\nintroductory texts will testify. High levels of uncertainty may indicate a dynamically complex\nproject, but this does not provide an exclusive definition \u2013 many small and relatively simple\nprojects could be classified as complex projects by this definition, and indeed there are well\ndeveloped responses to these situations, as we will show.\nTesting the definition further, the CSCPM [7] cites the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the Fellows of the College of\nCPM. If one considers the projects the Fellows have managed e.g. gas and oil pipelines,\nrailroads, flight control centres, space shuttle engines, combat ships, missile software, civil\nengineering and offshore structures to name a few, one immediately sees that these systems are\nnot necessarily complex. Complicated though they may be, if all of their parts are inert, they are\nnot complex. Their behaviour as a whole may be entirely understood by reducing them to their\nparts. Morris and Hough [21] categorised these as Major Projects, as does the UK\u2019s Major\nProjects Association (see [22]). Other organisations term them Program(me)s.\nThe types of projects referred to in the CSCPM may not meet a threshold measure of complexity,\nbut the social environment in which they take place may do. The Fellows of the College have\ntherefore managed complicated projects in complex social environments \u2013 but as for dealing\nwith uncertainty, this is the case for the majority of PM practitioners.\nThe complex project manager\nThe CSCPM hypothesises that today (more than in previous times), there exists a special\ncategory of projects called complex projects, the proper management of which can only be\nachieved by persons who are appropriately certified and sanctioned by their peers.\nThe CSCPM suggests there is a global acceptance of the shortfall in supply of complex project\nmanagers. Moreover, that there is an increasing demand for complex project managers. This is\nstated without a definition of complex (as stated above) or any data to justify that there is indeed\nan increase in the demand.\nClearly, many activities we participate in are very complicated; they have many components,\nmany interactions, have well defined boundaries with predictable interactions across them. Some\nactivities are complex \u2013 we can at least qualitatively say this. There is an inherent limitation in\nour ability to predict the long-term or emergent behaviour they create. It is not that prediction is\nmerely hard or that the system has not been completely modelled or understood. Rather, the lack\nof predictability arises from the nature of the interactions between the components and often\nfrom the inability to measure the state of the system at any time with sufficient precision.\nManaging under Complexity\nJust because we know a system is complex does not mean that we require complex tools to\ncontrol or manage it. More traditional methods may continue to be appropriate because we live\non a scale where these methods work well. The human brain has evolved to survive in a world\nwhere objects are neither very small nor very large and where things stand still or move slowly.\nToday it is commonly agreed that Quantum Mechanics describes how the world really works.\nHowever, humans have evolved in a world where Newtonian physics works well enough because\nsimple laws emerge on the scale our bodies operate. There are challenges to many of the long\nheld beliefs about tools and techniques used in projects, but these apply across the board and are\nnot necessarily limited to something that may be labelled as complex. Critical Path Method, for\ninstance, is a useful part of project planning, but it does not model the reality of the uncertainty\nof the project environment well in either small or large projects, simple or complicated [23].\nClearly here too, there is an opportunity for the issue to be considered further. Before continuing\nwith the notion that because a project is complex we need new tools and techniques, it would be\nhelpful to have a picture of what constitutes use and effective use of the existing tools and\ntechniques, and how they work in environments of varying dynamism.\nIn addition to tools and techniques, how does one manage or attempt to control a truly complex\nsystem? What kind of interventions are useful, and which interventions simply exacerbate\nproblems [24]? The weather is a complex system. The term \u2018weather\u2019 usually refers to the\nactivity of atmospheric phenomena over short periods of time such as hours or days. Weather\nforecasts are made by collecting data on the current state of the atmosphere (temperature, wind,\nhumidity etc) and then using computer models to determine how the atmosphere is expected to\nchange. The complex nature of the atmosphere means that perfect forecasting is impossible, and\nforecasts become less accurate as the forecast range increases. The methodology of forecasting\nthe weather can be similarly applied to other complex systems like the stock-markets. Again,\nperfect forecasting is impossible and only short range forecasts are reliable. The 50% rule and\nrolling wave planning (e.g. [25]), Last Planner [26], and variations on agile project management\n[27], extreme programming and other IT-derived methods, are all responses to this reality. None\nof these are factored into the discussions of dealing with this claimed new complexity.\nHaving set out current understanding of complexity, the approach taken by the College can be\nassessed as having not justified that the projects in which they are interested are complex,\nbecause they have not satisfactorily established any measures or threshold for such complexity.\nIndeed, the projects listed in the resumes, whilst \u2018large\u2019 or \u2018major\u2019 projects, are hardly unique.\nSimilarly, stating that they are socially constructed systems is a useful view, but again does not\nprovide any meaningful exclusivity. The additional demand for \u2018complex project managers\u2019 is\nnot justified. Finally, the requirement for new tools and techniques is not based on any critical\nevaluation of either the espoused theory or the theory in practice. Relatively recent responses in\nboth theory and practice have not been evaluated.\nThe process by which the college and the standard has emerged\nIn 2006 PM was purportedly added to the list of disciplines to which complexity theory was\napplied, as the \u2018discipline of CPM\u2019 was unofficially launched at the 20th IPMA World Congress\nin Shanghai. As discussed previously, the application of complexity theory to PM was not new\neven then, being pre-dated by Shenhar [16] and others [28, 29].\nIt is clear though, that there are some well established responses to complexity \u2013 as outlined\nabove. In developing a future research agenda for PM, the Rethinking Project Management\nNetwork (2004-2006 \u2013 see [30]) attempted to move the agenda of research away from the highly\ndeterministic view of projects that had prevailed up to that point.\nHowever, approaches away from the mainstream (as defined by the bodies of knowledge for\ninstance) are not well developed, and will require further investigation before they can be\nregarded as \u2018current technology.\u2019 The following section considers the content in more detail, but\nfor now the process by which the College and standard have emerged is worth stating.\nDuring 2006 there were extensive efforts on the part of the protagonists of the College to recruit\nsenior practitioners as Fellows of the College. In doing so, this provided implicit endorsement of\nthe College, its aims, and the processes of the organisations that the Fellows represented. This\nprocess by itself has succeeded where the other PM institutions have only had limited success\nrestricting entry to the profession (see e.g. [31]).\nOne also has to question the basis that the Fellows are working from. Specifically, given the\nlevels of performance indicated in survey after survey (e.g. [32]), is promoting the existing\nincumbents really a good idea? This appears to be running the risk that the existing approaches,\nwhich can hardly be said to be working effectively, are simply reinforced and further legitimised\nand institutionalised. Further, what is the problem that this initiative is trying to solve or be part\nof the solution to? By what analysis is the addition of further competencies to individual project\nmanagers, the solution to \u2018challenged performance\u2019 in major projects? A fuller analysis of the\nissues (as we will propose) may for instance, find that the issues are more systemic rather than\nunder the influence of the project manager. Similarly, issues such as the ownership and\nmanagement of risk and opportunities (rather than outsourcing risk) may be at the root of the\nproblems faced. Without fuller analysis we can only speculate on this. Intuitively, the supply of\ncomplex project managers is unlikely be at the root of such analysis and any credible business\ncase for change must consider root causes.\nWhat is the likely business case for the standard? Section 11 of the CSCPM describes the\nCollege as a charity as it is not for profit and has no membership fees (Australian and UK\nDefence Departments are currently providing secretarial support). However, it also mentions that\nthe College will develop and establish postgraduate programmes in CPM. Section 12 provides a\nglimpse at what the CSCPM and College is likely to be all about \u2013 not only selectively awarding\nthe keys to the profession, but owning the gates to it. One consequence of the Australian and UK\nDefence Departments willingness to sign up to the CSCPM, is that all government contractors\nand subcontractors will necessarily be required (it will not be optional) to train and certify their\nproject managers in CPM. This need for training and certification will powerfully drive a whole\nnew industry of CPM course developers, trainers, and certifiers. Given the size of the industries\ninvolved, this has the potential to be a substantial business, though this does depend on how far\ndown the work breakdown (assuming the WBS concept is still relevant in complex projects, it\nbeing so reductionist in outlook) the complexity would be perceived to go.\nIt is clear that the Fellows of the College decide who they let in to their club; they choose who\nthey give the keys to. The College, the administrators of the standards and therefore the keepers\nof the gates to \u2018the profession\u2019 can, in the same manner that they created it, change it at will.\nAmongst the questions this situation poses is how useful is this situation to the Australian or UK\nDefence Departments?\nThe situation is clear. The development of the College and its standard has proceeded without\ncheckpoints and with political support rather than intellectual input to test the core concepts. We\nwill discuss the content of the CSCPM in the following section; however, based on the argument\nthus far there is the potential for an entire new industry in training and certification to add to the\ncurrent offerings in this area. The business case for this is not clear.\nThe content of the competency standard\nNotwithstanding the challenges identified above \u2013 the definition and the process both being\nflawed, the content should similarly be treated in a critical manner. When the APM was revising\nits BoK (see Morris [33]), there was a significant research project underpinning it. When PMI\nundertake revising their BoK, they draw on the extensive research that they commission to do\nthis. Whatever the politics or purpose of those standards, they have at least some basis to the\nclaim of representing \u2018accepted practice\u2019 (though not best practice). The attempt at\nnormalisation is justified on the basis that there are many organisations who have not even got to\na basic level of process, and many new project managers coming into \u2018the profession\u2019 daily who\nneed to have a grounding in these basics.\nHowever, none of these are based on such a limited view as the standard being promoted by the\nCollege. It is not clear what research has underpinned its development, and the competence\nlevels appear to have been allocated on an entirely arbitrary basis as any attempt to rationalise\nthe allocation of competency levels in the example shown in fig. 2 will show. Fig 3 provides a\nkey to the four levels of competency. We think it perfectly reasonable for the authors of the\nCSCPM to demonstrate the empirical evidence for the practices that will be driven and enforced\nthrough the standards.\nHaving seen the criteria, consider how a certifier of the standard would validate evidence in\norder to certify a CPM practitioner as competent or even leader. Concerning examples are not\nhard to find in the CSCPM. Fig 2 shows View 3 Change and Journey, element 3.10 Pilot\nprojects \u2013 symbolism and the management of meaning: certifiers are required to validate\nevidence that the practitioner is competent in myth creation and \u2018walks their talk\u201d. Another\nexample, View 10 Special Attributes, element 10.1 Wisdom: practitioners have a robust self-\nesteem, a sense of wonder, and reserves time to sit back, relax, and mull over issues.\nFinally, the content itself is completely untested. One view is that it risks plunging the PM\ncommunity into the dark ages. With no empirical evidence to support it, the CSCPM drives\nproject managers to apply the knowledge and theories of metaphors, rich pictures, anti-\npositivism, punctuated equilibrium, and the butterfly effect. These terms have more in common\nwith the chapter headings of a compendium on post-modernism than they do with real people\nmanaging (complicated) projects. Whilst they provide useful views of the project environment,\nthey are relatively undeveloped in application in the project environment (rich pictures in soft-\nsystems methods being the possible exception). It would be interesting to hear the application,\nbeyond the complexity response already discussed above (rolling wave plans, 50% rule etc), that\nthe butterfly effect would suggest. As for previous issues, there is a real opportunity here for\nresearch to demonstrate how these ideas have been applied and their relative costs and benefits.\nSimilarly, cases of the application of particular practices do need to be written and disseminated\nto support evidence-based training where skills gaps are identified.\nConclusions and areas for further research\nThe College and the standard trouble us for a host of reasons: the definition of complex does not\nstand up to any scrutiny; there has been no analysis of the problems that the establishment of this\ninitiative is intended to solve; the process by which the College and the standard have progressed\nhas gone un-checked; and the standard is not established on evidence based practices.\nA good place to start is with an understanding of the problems faced in the kinds of projects\nembraced by the College \u2013 projects that we and others have termed \u2018major\u2019 rather than complex.\nSpecifically, it is required to understand the root causes of problems. We propose the following\nresearch question:\nWhat has been the root causes of failure in major (e.g. defence procurement) projects?\nThis question does not assume that the causes are all generalisable, but would provide the\nfoundation for determining the nature of the initiatives that would start towards improved\nperformance. The role that further training and accreditation would play in this would then be\nevident, and the business case clear.\nOn the definition, we concluded that there was no case for treating the kind of projects discussed\nby the College as \u2018complex\u2019 any differently from other large, complicated undertakings. This led\nto the second research question:\nHow do you measure complexity in a robust manner, that takes account of structural, dynamic\nand interaction elements?\nThis would allow setting boundaries for levels of complexity within projects, and allow analysis\nof the supposition that projects have increased in complexity. Similarly, we concluded that\nbeyond the existing tool sets of PM, there was little defined that would be relevant as tools\ncoming from the \u2018post-modernist book chapter headings\u2019. Understanding the level of complexity\nin a project would allow evaluation of the current approaches, and the conditions under which\nthese and emergent alternatives are effective. This led to the third and fourth research questions:\nUnder what conditions of complexity are the current toolsets and approaches to managing\nprojects effective?\nHow should the approach to a high complexity project differ from that of a non-complex\nproject?\nRelated to the toolsets was the issue of the interventions that project managers can make in\ncomplex systems. These are poorly described by the standard, and are worth further research.\nSpecifically research question five:\nUnder what conditions (including complex) are different interventions effective?\nFinally, having started the process to provide credible knowledge under-pinning the definition\nand associated approaches, it would then be worth considering the personal skills, competencies,\nthinking processes, attitudes and abilities that underpin high performance in \u2018complex projects.\u2019\nIt has been argued that 21st century practitioner development will focus more on enabling\nreflective practitioners rather than providing skilled technicians [30]. A standard may indeed\ncontain some of these elements, but it is key to such a process that we understand:\nWhat are the characteristics of managers who appear to be able to handle complexity at pre-\ndefined levels, and are these characteristics imitable?\nWe would then have some reassurance that a competency standard had some basis in fact, and\nwas able to demonstrate business benefit to organisations that adopted it.\nThe process of the development of the College and the standard are undoubtedly flawed, and\nmaybe given the emergent state of development of the academic subject area, they have simply\nfilled a vacuum. The proliferation of unchecked standards will only fragment the emerging\nprofession and reinforce the notion of Project Management as just another fad. The challenge for\nthe academic and practitioner communities is to possess a credible suite of tools and techniques,\nwell developed through research such as that outlined above, which are based on good evidence\nand that support practitioners in improving performance in their own environments.\nReferences\n1.
