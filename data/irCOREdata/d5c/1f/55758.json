More recently, teacher training and professional development have often been used to promote\nand reinforce a narrow focus on the government\u2019s \u2018standards agenda\u2019. However, the emerging dis-\ncourse of \u2018new professionalism\u2019 has raised the profile of professional development in schools, and,\ntogether with union learning representatives, there are opportunities to secure real improvements in\nteachers\u2019 access to continuing professional development.

It has also been a controversial and\ncontested history in which fundamental questions have been raised about unions\u2019 role\nin relation to the wider social and economic system. Within the history of the British\nlabour movement there has always been a strong tradition of seeking to work within\nthe system in order to maximise the benefits for workers, whilst the voices of those\nwho have argued that unions must ask more fundamental questions about the nature\nof capitalism have tended to be more marginal (Hyman, 1989). This conflict,\npresented crudely as between reformists and radicals, is echoed in the history of trade\nunion education (Simon, 1990), which for many years wrestled with the tensions\n*Centre for Educational Research and Development, University of Lincoln, Brayford Pool, Lincoln\nLN6 7TS, UK.

Stevenson\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nbetween an independent and critical working-class education\u2014\u2019carried on by and for\nthe working class, and under its own control\u2019 (Simon, 1990, p. 16), and a system\nunderpinned by significant state support, positioned within, rather than against, the\ndominant economic system.\nThe political, economic and social context at the current time is in many respects\nsignificantly different from, for example, the issues identified by Brian Simon in the\nearly part of the twentieth century. However, in important ways the relatively recent\nemergence of union learning representatives resurrects the historic debate within\ntrade union education about the extent to which such education has an explicit role\nin challenging the status quo. Or is it the case\u2014as an integral element of the relation-\nship between the state, capital and labour\u2014that union learning representatives are\ncentral to reinforcing, rather than challenging, current orthodoxies?\nUnion learning representatives have developed as a key feature on the landscape of\ncontemporary trade unionism within the United Kingdom. Supported by statutory\nentitlements, union learning representatives have a qualitatively different function\nwithin trade union education in so far as their role is presented as one of facilitator,\nrather than provider. Union learning representatives have a key role in supporting\nfellow union members to gain improved access to education and training through the\nprovision of advice, and the negotiation of learning agreements with employers. A key\nemphasis for union learning representatives has been to support those sections of the\nworkforce for whom an inability to access basic skills leaves them at greater risk of\nmarginalisation in the labour market. However, union learning representatives are\nalso a feature of white-collar unionism, and this article focuses on the role, and the\npotential role, of union learning representatives in the school teacher unions.\nUnion learning representatives have developed at a time when issues of teacher\neducation and professional development have emerged high on the policy agenda.\nPolicy discourses speak of a \u2018new professionalism\u2019 (RIG, 2005) in which teachers\u2019\nwork will be better informed by access to high-quality continuing professional devel-\nopment. However, the apparent increase in emphasis on professional development\nalso highlights the potential use of such forms of teacher training as a means of rein-\nforcing current policy agendas. Education performs a powerful role in forming and\nshaping the \u2018common sense\u2019 of the world that we inhabit. Teachers\u2019 training, and\ntheir continuing professional development, exerts a powerful influence on teachers\u2019\nprofessional world\u2014shaping not only what they do, but what questions are presented\nand how problems are perceived in the first instance.\nIn such circumstances, union learning representatives may have an important role\nto play in ensuring their colleagues can access the professional development that is\nthe rhetoric of new professionalism. However, as union learning representatives, to\nwhat extent is it possible for teachers in these roles to work against the grain of current\npolicy, and to open up spaces where the common sense of current policy discourses\nis challenged?\nThis article identifies how teacher education and the continuing professional\ndevelopment of in-service teachers performs a powerful role in shaping and reinforc-\ning the discourses within which policy is framed. It then explores the role of the union\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 458  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\nUnion learning representatives as organic intellectuals 459\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nlearning representative within school teacher unions, and specifically within the\ncontext of the new professionalism agenda. The paper highlights the development of\nunion learning representatives within a context of \u2018social partnership\u2019 in which unions\nand employers seek to work together to secure common objectives. The article\nconcludes by discussing the potential development of the role of union learning repre-\nsentatives, but located within the more traditional concerns of trade union education.\nDrawing on Gramsci\u2019s (1971) notion of the \u2018organic intellectual\u2019, the present paper\nargues that union learning representatives can create spaces in which critical\ndiscourses can emerge, and in which ideas that challenge current orthodoxies can be\nencouraged and developed.\nTeacher education and professional development: capturing the discourse\nPerhaps one of the most remarkable features of the changes that have taken place in\nthe English school system in recent years has been the degree of centralisation, and\nthe extent to which the discourse of \u2018standards\u2019 has come to dominate the entire\neducational landscape. Such developments are common in different forms globally,\nbut even by international comparison the extent to which the English system has\nsuccumbed to the demands of the central state are striking. Of course, the means by\nwhich this has been achieved are complex. There can be little doubt that the suffocat-\ning presence of the body responsible for the inspection of schools in England, the\nOffice for Standards in Education (OFSTED), buttressed by the introduction of\nquasi-market structures, has had a profound disciplinary impact\u2014encouraging\nuniformity across the sector, coupled with an obedience to the demands of national\npolicy. However, it is important to recognise how many of these processes have been\nreinforced by key developments in teacher education and professional development,\nthe consequence of which has been to narrow the opportunities for generating critical\nperspectives in relation to current policy.\nThe importance of teacher education to winning the battle of ideas in education\nwas perhaps most graphically illustrated by the state\u2019s role in reforming teacher train-\ning by taking control of the teacher training curriculum and putting OFSTED in\nplace to police its implementation (Furlong, 2005). Coupled with the encouragement\nof more school-based routes to qualified teacher status, the consequence of these\nchanges has been to focus \u2018training\u2019 more on practical skills of \u2018delivery\u2019, whilst\nmarginalising efforts to raise more fundamental questions about pedagogy and prac-\ntice. These tendencies within initial teacher education have then been reinforced by\nthe state\u2019s nationalisation of \u2018leadership and management\u2019 training under the auspices\nof the National College for School Leadership (NCSL). In contrast to the United\nStates, for example, where a master\u2019s qualification is the accepted route to principal-\nship, policy in England requires potential head teachers to hold the NCSL-provided\nNational Professional Qualification for Headteachers, a qualification reinforced by a\nbattery of related programmes for middle leaders, new and experienced head teach-\ners. NCSL\u2019s monopoly on providing the professional qualification for headship,\nsupported by its associated programmes, provides a powerful mechanism whereby\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 459  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\n460 H. Stevenson\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nthe central state, through its arms-length agents, is able to assert influence over all\nthose teachers who take on the leadership of a school. The impact of all these reforms\nis to significantly diminish the role of universities and other higher education institu-\ntions in providing teacher education and professional development. Hence those\ninstitutions whose traditional mission has been to generate new knowledge and to\npromote challenge and critique as the basis of educational enquiry have their role\nsignificantly diminished through the influence of new forms of regulation and profes-\nsional accreditation.\nMoreover, it is possible to discern further ways in which teachers\u2019 professional\ndevelopment becomes used both to support and to reinforce the demands of the\ncentral policy agenda. Specifically these link to the ways in which the culture of\nperformativity increasingly drives the professional development needs of both teach-\ners and schools. At an individual level, teachers face a performance management\nsystem that is now heavily focused on demonstrating impact on pupil performance.\nBoth pay and career progression are underpinned by the need to show improved\nresults, and within the performance management system there is a clear logic to iden-\ntifying continuing professional development needs that support the drive for results.\nThe link between professional development and performance at an individual level\nthen becomes replicated at an institutional level as schools operating in a competitive\nenvironment search for quick-fix solutions that offer the prospect of providing\nimproved results, quickly. In such circumstances it is little surprise if growing\nnumbers of private providers enter the market to offer schools what they want (Ball,\n2007). These organisations have no mission to generate new knowledge, to challenge\nor critique. On the contrary, their business survival depends on appearing to make the\nsystem work, not raising wider fundamental questions about the efficacy of the system\nitself.\nThe extent to which continuing professional development is both driven by\nnational agendas, and reinforces them, is highlighted by the Association of Teachers\nand Lecturers (2005, p. 3): \nGovernment policy has attempted to standardise practice, showing a lack of trust in the\nprofession and a denial of complexity. It conceptualises CPD [continuing professional\ndevelopment] as a management tool to ensure good classroom practice, and is seeking to\nembed it within the management toolkit, including performance management, pay\nprogression and contract. Items of training are to be imposed on teachers according only\nto immediate corporate needs.\nTeacher unions, continuing professional development and the new \nprofessionalism\nTeacher unions have long had an interest in \u2018professional issues\u2019 and professional\ndevelopment. Arguably the history of teacher unions in England often reflects\nuncomfortable efforts to reconcile their dual role as traditional trade unions\ncampaigning on issues of pay and conditions of service, and professional associations\nadvocating on matters of professional concern for teachers (Ironside & Seifert, 1995).\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 460  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\nUnion learning representatives as organic intellectuals 461\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nAlthough it is not straightforward (Naylor, 2002), it is still arguably the case that the\nmost effective way of differentiating between teacher unions is to locate them in\nrelation to their stance on so-called industrial and professional issues. However,\ndespite their long-held interest in professional issues, and matters of professional\ndevelopment in particular, it is only relatively recently that English teacher unions\nhave moved beyond a somewhat narrow engagement with these issues. Traditionally\nunions had restricted their own provision of training to union officers with an empha-\nsis on supporting those in lay roles who undertook representational duties on behalf\nof members. Unlike teacher unions in the United States, for example (Kerchner &\nMitchell, 1988; Kerchner, 1993), there was no tradition of English teacher unions as\ndirect providers of professional development. Conference motions tended to restrict\nthemselves to calls for \u2018more continuing professional development\u2019, and the non-\ncontact time that would make this accessible.\nBy the 1990s this situation was beginning to change. Unions such as the Associa-\ntion of Teachers and Lecturers were increasingly positioning themselves around\nissues of professional development. At the same time the National Union of Teachers\nwas drawing on ideas from the US teacher unions, and recognising that direct union\nprovision of continuing professional development offered opportunities to engage\nwith members who might otherwise be less inclined to participate in the union\nthrough established structures (Barber, 1992). The election of New Labour in 1997\ngave these developments a significant spur with the establishment of the union learn-\ning fund and union learning representatives, backed up with statutory entitlements.\nAlthough this initiative was arguably focused on those sectors of the workforce at\ngreatest risk of exclusion, and in greatest needs of skills development (Fryer, 1997),\nunion learning representatives have been taken up by all the main teacher unions and\nhave become a key feature of union strategy in relation to promoting professional\ndevelopment for their members.\nIt is significant, but not coincidental, that union learning representatives have\ndeveloped alongside the emerging \u2018new professionalism\u2019 agenda in schools and\ndebates that have taken place regarding the transformation of the school workforce\n(Department for Education and Skills, 2002). In 2003 most of the teacher unions\nsigned a national agreement (Department for Education and Skills, 2003) with\nGovernment and local authority employers that set out to both raise educational stan-\ndards, whilst also reducing teacher workload. The squaring of this particular circle\nwas to be achieved through the reconfiguration of the school workforce in a way that\nencouraged support staff to undertake \u2018non-essential\u2019 tasks previously undertaken by\nteachers. Styled as a \u2018remodelling\u2019 of the workforce, this agenda has since metamor-\nphosed into the \u2018new professionalism\u2019 (RIG, 2005), and has extended its remit to\ncover pay restructuring and new performance management arrangements.\nThe new professionalism agenda is now one of the dominant influences on the\ntraining and professional development needs of schools, and it is important to identify\nits component elements in more detail. Elsewhere, I and others (Stevenson et al.,\n2007) have argued that new professionalism is best analysed in terms of four distin-\nguishing features. First is an emphasis on the so-called \u2018core task of teaching and\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 461  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\n462 H. Stevenson\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nlearning\u2019, whereby teachers\u2019 work is re-organised\u2014ostensibly to allow teachers more\ntime to focus on teaching rather than be distracted by extraneous and unnecessary\ntasks. Although many aspects of these changes are uncontentious (such as the\nremoval of a range of bureaucratic duties from teachers), there are consequences\n(such as an increased emphasis on the \u2018academic\u2019 role of a teacher at the expense of\n\u2018pastoral\u2019 issues) that are much more contested and strike at the heart of what it\nmeans to both teach and be a teacher (Stevenson, 2007a). Second is an acceptance\nof new accountability regimes, such as performance management and performance-\nrelated pay, in which teachers are held increasingly accountable for the performance\nof their pupils. In many ways this may be considered the key quid pro quo for the intro-\nduction of initiatives that may have had a beneficial on reducing workload pressures.\nAlthough teachers, for example, now have a statutory entitlement to 10% planning,\npreparation and assessment time, they are also subject to a performance management\nregime that ratchets up considerably the pressure to perform. \u2018Performance\u2019 in this\ncontext is increasingly framed within a framework that focuses on measurable outputs\nof student achievement in standardised tests.\nThe third discernible element of the new professionalism agenda is a focus on\ncontinuing professional development and a recognition that \u2018improvement\u2019 requires\ninvestment in staff and their continued training and development. As with other\nelements of the remodelling reforms (such as the emphasis on performance manage-\nment), the case for investment in continuing professional development is rooted in\ncontemporary human resource management strategy. Recognising the importance of\nhuman resources, especially in labour-intensive service industries, it is asserted that\nthe key to competitive advantage is achieved by investment in human capital. In a\ncontext of limited resources, centrally imposed targets and quasi-market operating\nenvironments, the logic of this argument applies equally to public services as to\ncommercial enterprises. The fourth, and final, feature of new professionalism is an\nemphasis on partnership in which teacher professionalism is predicated on the notion\nof a constructive dialogue between all key stakeholders. The approach does not neces-\nsarily eschew industrial militancy, but it does reject the adversarialism of traditional\ncollective bargaining (Stevenson & Carter, 2007). In contrast, the partnership\napproach is based on generating pragmatic solutions to common problems as a means\nof securing win\u2013win outcomes (NEA, 2003). Within the new professionalism agenda,\nthis approach is illustrated by the emergence of the Social Partnership (Bangs, 2006;\nPassy et al., 2007) in which teacher and support staff unions, central government and\nlocal authority employers work together to develop and promote the new profession-\nalism agenda.\nOf the four elements of new professionalism presented above, the latter two have a\nparticular significance in relation to the development and role of union learning repre-\nsentatives. Clearly the increased emphasis, at a rhetorical level at least, placed on\nprofessional development provides opportunities for union learning representatives to\npress the case for improved teacher access to continuing professional development.\nAs has been indicated, lack of access to professional development has been a long-\nheld concern for teacher unions. Although there is now an apparently increase interest\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 462  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\nUnion learning representatives as organic intellectuals 463\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nin ensuring teachers can access relevant continuing professional development, it is not\nyet clear how far this might result in significant and tangible improvements for teach-\ners. Despite the rhetoric, there are still powerful pressures\u2014notably, limited resourc-\ning\u2014that are likely to restrict teacher access to continuing professional development.\nUnion learning representatives therefore have an important role in maximising the\nopportunities provided by an apparent coalescing of employer and teacher interests\naround the need for improved professional development opportunities.\nThe notion of converging interests highlights the extent to which union learning\nrepresentatives may be assisted in their role by the development of a social partner-\nship model of industrial relations in schools. It has been argued more widely (Clough,\n2005) that the development of union learning representatives represents a practical\nmanifestation of social partnership as advocated by the Trades Union Congress\n(TUC, 1999). Within this model of industrial relations, emphasis is placed on\nemployers and unions working together\u2014\u2019effective partnerships are built on a shared\nunderstanding of, and commitment to, the business goals of the organization\u2019 (TUC,\n1999, p. 13), whilst recognising the autonomy and independence of each of the part-\nners within that. Significantly, \u2018training and development\u2019 (TUC, 1999, p. 11) is\nidentified as one of three areas where the possibilities for partnership might be most\nfertile. It is the case that social partnership in the school sector has developed in ways\nthat are quite distinctive to the sector (Passy et al., 2007); however, it is possible to\nsee the emergence of union learning representatives as firmly located within the\ndevelopment of this wider TUC-driven initiative.\nNevertheless, whilst the development of a social partnership model of industrial\nrelations in schools may offer opportunities for the development of union learning\nrepresentatives, it may also point to important limitations. Social partnership seeks to\nprovide an independent voice for employees, which is separate from the employer-\ndriven \u2018employee participation\u2019 initiatives that are a feature of much contemporary\nhuman resource management (TUC, 1999). As such, and especially within school\nsector education, it might be presented as a strategic choice by unions to seek re-\nassert influence through a more constructive engagement with employers. Central to\nthis re-engagement is an acceptance of the overall aims of the enterprise. Social part-\nnership is a debate about means, not ends. Hence, within the private sector, social\npartnership represents a formal acceptance by trade unions of the need for the\ncommercial success of individual enterprises within a capitalist economy. It does not\nseek to challenge the fundamental nature of the employment relationship and the\nsocial relations that underpin it. This is not to suggest that trade unions have always\nseen themselves as critics of the capitalist enterprise\u2014the reality has always been\nmuch more complex. However, it is to argue that social partnership represents a\nsignificant and qualitatively different adaptation to the dominance of current modes\nof production. So too can it be argued in school sector education that social partner-\nship represents an acceptance of the fundamental elements of the post-1988 Act\nrestructuring together with the future trajectory of policy. The debate is no longer\nabout the efficacy of the standards agenda, and the competition-driven system that\nunderpins it, but rather the debate becomes restricted to how best to raise \u2018standards\u2019.\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 463  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\n464 H. Stevenson\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nWithin this context, the potential role of the union learning representative is\nlimited. It is reduced to seeking more continuing professional development for\nmembers, but without being able to question the type of professional development\nbeing secured, or the efficacy of the wider system it seeks to support. By working\nwithin, and towards, the overall objectives of the organisation, union learning repre-\nsentatives not only leave the wider system in tact, they may actively reinforce it with\nunion endorsement effectively undermining rank and file resistance. The danger is\nthat union learning representatives simply reproduce the managerialist system of\nperformance appraisal-driven professional development within which their members\nhave to work. Union learning representatives can then be seen as no more than trying\nto compensate for the limitations of a management system that on its own terms may\nbe inadequate.\nWhilst there may be elements of this analysis that fail to convey the complexity of\nthe role that union learning representatives perform on behalf of their members, it\nnevertheless serves to highlight the potentially narrow role played by these new union\nofficers, and also the need to think more widely about the role they may perform.\nChallenging the orthodoxy: union learning representatives as organic \nintellectuals\nThus far I have argued that different forms of teacher training and staff development\nhave played a key role in winning teacher support for the process of school restruc-\nturing that began with the 1988 Education Reform Act, and which has represented a\npermanent revolution since then. This has been a difficult environment in which\nteacher unions have had to engage, and, although they continue to represent a power-\nful force in the school system, they have been unable to fundamentally challenge the\noverall trajectory of policy development. Union learning representatives provide an\nimportant opportunity for unions to support their members in the current context\nand to work towards meeting the demands of members frustrated by their limited\naccess to professional development. However, given the framework of a social part-\nnership approach to industrial relations, there is a danger that union learning repre-\nsentatives perform only a limited role. Not only do they fail to challenge the wider\nsystem, and for example the social inequalities it generates, but they actively reinforce\nit. If union learning representatives are to transcend this role, and to provide some\nspace in which dominant ideas in education are challenged, then it may be useful to\ndraw on the notion of the organic intellectual developed by Antonio Gramsci (1971).\nOne of Gramsci\u2019s central concerns in his Prison Notebooks is the role performed by\nintellectuals in \u2018organising ideas\u2019 and providing the ideological framework within\nwhich hegemonic power might be exercised. For Gramsci, intellectuals were much\nmore than \u2018thinkers\u2019 (thinking, after all, is an activity common to all) but were distin-\nguishable by the specific organising function they performed in society: \u2018All men are\nintellectuals \u2026 but not all men have in society the function of intellectuals\u2019 (Gramsci,\n1971, p. 9). This shifts the focus from intellectuality as the preserve of an elite minor-\nity to a broader conception of intellectuality as engagement in the development of\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 464  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\nUnion learning representatives as organic intellectuals 465\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nideas. Specifically, Gramsci was concerned with how intellectual activity defined in\nthese terms might either reinforce or challenge the existing social order. The link\nbetween the generation of ideas and social action was made explicit by Gramsci in his\nnotion of \u2018organic intellectual\u2019 (1971, p. 10). Organic intellectuals were those indi-\nviduals who had a role in developing and propagating the ideas that challenged the\ndominant ideology. Gramsci\u2019s focus on both consent and coercion as the twin\nelements underpinning hegemonic power highlighted the importance he placed on\nideological considerations, and therefore the need to \u2018assimilate and conquer\u2019 (1971,\np. 10) the ideas of the existing order. For Gramsci, organic intellectuals were not\nremote and passive individuals, but were likely to be grounded in the social move-\nments they represented. Organic intellectuals were likely to be actively engaged in\n\u2018practical life\u2019 as \u2018constructor, organiser, \u201cpermanent persuader\u201d\u2019. (Gramsci, 1971,\np. 10)\u2014a notion that not only emphasises the role of organic intellectuals as activists,\nbut also as a role alongside, and not remote from, those being organised.\nThe role of organic intellectual outlined by Gramsci points to the possibility of how\nthe role of the union learning representative might be conceived. This is not to argue\nthat all union learning representatives should be spear-heading the ideological war\nagainst neo-liberalism. This is neither realistic nor practical. However, it is to argue\nthat union learning representatives have a vital role in creating a space in which the\ndominant, almost all-pervading, discourses of current education policy might be\ncritiqued and challenged. The necessary first steps in this process require uncoupling\nunion learning representatives from the strategic HRM approach in which they are\ncurrently steeped, and locating the post in an approach that has its roots in more\ntraditional models of trade union and political education . In these cases, union learn-\ning representatives need to develop as something distinctive and different to the\ncurrent role of continuing professional development coordinator\u2014with whom they\nare sometimes confused (Alexandrou & O\u2019Brien, 2007). Union learning representa-\ntives should continue to have a key role in negotiating with employers to improve\nunion members\u2019 access to professional development. Developing union learning\nrepresentatives\u2019 role by embedding them in collective bargaining structures is an\nimportant way in which union learning representatives become more than just\ncontinuing professional development advisers for colleagues and become genuine\nadvocates of an improved learning environment for teachers. However, union learn-\ning representatives should also be encouraged to promote new and different forms of\nprofessional development\u2014driven by distinctive union values and promoting union\nobjectives. In so doing, spaces open up to discuss new and critical ideas\u2014ideas that\nhave often been driven out of schools by the relentless pressure to meet targets and\nsatisfy inspectors.\nSuch a role may not be welcomed by many union learning representatives. There\nis already considerable evidence to suggest that union members who undertake\nunion-organised continuing professional development activities, or take on the role of\nunion learning representative, are often individuals who have not previously had\nexperience of engaging with the union (Wood & Moore, 2007). It is not unreasonable\nto assume that many of these individuals will be attracted to this type of activity\nAQ2\nAQ1\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 465  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\n466 H. Stevenson\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nprecisely because it breaks out of some of the traditional stereotypes of union activity\nand campaigning. Involvement such as this is to be welcomed and encouraged as one\nof the real benefits of the development of the union learning representative. However,\nit is not a reason to simply replicate a management-driven professional development\nagenda with one that has a union label. If union learning representatives are to begin\nto take on the sort of role presented in this paper, then they will need to be supported\nthrough both the lay and professional structures of their unions. At a lay level, union\nofficers need to engage actively with the role of the union learning representative and\nthe central role it can play in developing a vibrant union culture. Dismissing the work\nas peripheral, or \u2018not union work\u2019, seriously underestimates an important opportunity\nto challenge the existing orthodoxy. Within the professional structures of the union,\nthe support for union learning representatives through training needs to ensure that\nthose who take on the role are provided with a good understanding of what the role\nmight look like. Unions themselves need to take on the role of collective organic intel-\nlectuals (Togliatti, 1979) by generating the discussions that challenge government\npolicy at an intellectual and ideological level. Timidity about engaging with ideas does\nno more than leave the field open for dominant discourses to progress unchallenged.\nConclusion\nRestructuring the public education system in England has been accompanied by a\nsubstantial and sustained ideological challenge to the welfarist values that under-\npinned the development of the comprehensive education system in the latter part of\nthe twentieth century (Gewirtz, 2002). Central to the engineering of this process of\nchange has been a \u2018reculturing\u2019 of the teaching profession in which efforts have been\nmade by the state to align professional values with state objectives. This has been\nachieved in part by seeking to marginalise independent and critical voices, such as\nteacher unions and institutions of higher education. It has also been secured through\nthe introduction of regulatory forms of control that ensure compliance and confor-\nmity across the profession. A key element of this ideological battle to capture and\ncontrol the discourse shaping the future direction of policy has been increased central\ncontrol of teacher education and professional development.\nMore recently the linked developments of a new relationship between the state and\nteacher unions in the form of a social partnership, and the development of the new\nprofessionalism agenda, has placed an increasing emphasis on professional develop-\nment as a central element of the strategy to continue to press for higher standards.\nWithin this context, union learning representatives have emerged with a key role to\nplay in advocating for colleagues and seeking improved access to continuing profes-\nsional development. Union learning representatives have an important role to play in\nensuring that much of the rhetoric about professional development within the new\nprofessionalism agenda has the prospect of becoming a reality. However, there is a\ndistinct danger within this approach that union learning representatives become no\nmore than a union-endorsed version of the continuing professional development\ncoordinator\u2014making the system work when pressures from elsewhere may threaten\nRJIE_A_332979.fm  Page 466  Friday, September 26, 2008  9:25 PM\nUnion learning representatives as organic intellectuals 467\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\nto undermine it. Conceived in these terms, union learning representatives are unlikely\nto challenge the current discourse dominating education policy, quite the reverse.\nThey are likely to contribute to its reinforcement.\nThis article argues that union learning representatives are a key development in\nthe new industrial relations landscape but that unions need to think more creatively\nand more ambitiously about what their role might be. Challenging the dominance of\ncurrent discourses in education requires spaces where alternative and critical\nperspectives can be developed. These have been systematically closed down in\nrecent years, and new approaches to generating critical discourses now need to be\nconsidered. Union learning representatives have a potentially vital role in creating\nthe spaces in which these ideas may emerge, and doing so in such a way that\nconnects the battle for ideas with teachers at the workplace. Union learning repre-\nsentatives are perhaps uniquely placed to make the connection between ideas and\naction\u2014with each informing the other. In this sense union learning representatives\nhave a key organising role to play, influenced by the notion of organic intellectual\ndeveloped by Gramsci. This is not to exaggerate the role and influence that union\nlearning representatives may be able to play; however, it is to assert that union learn-\ning representatives have an important potential role in helping reclaim the discourse\nshaping education policy. For this to happen, a necessary first step is for teacher\nunions to recognise that union learning representatives need to help challenge\ncurrent orthodoxy, not reinforce it.\nIf unions are to successfully resist the forward march of neo-liberal reform that is\nrestructuring public education, then it is vital that they engage in an ideological battle\nwith dominant discourses. Failure to do so leaves unions dependent on fighting rear-\nguard actions\u2014resisting an academy school here, or redundancies there. Such strug-\ngles are the lifeblood of unionism, and vital in any campaign of resistance. But unless\nthey are linked to a wider ideological renewal of unionism that is capable of mobilising\nthose within and beyond schools behind a new vision of democratic public education,\nthen such isolated campaigns are unlikely to yield long-term and significant gains\n(Stevenson, 2007b). Unions and other progressive forces must engage in the struggle\nfor hegemonic power\u2014recognising this \u2018is constantly having to be built and rebuilt;\nit is contested and negotiated\u2019 (Apple, 2003, p. 6). Union learning representatives\nhave the potential to play an important role in that process of ideological renewal and\nengagement in which dominant ideas are challenged and contested. They are\nuniquely placed to connect struggles on the ground with wider debates about the\nfuture trajectory of policy. Their potential should not be underestimated.\nReferences\nAlexandrou, A. & O\u2019Brien, J. (2007) Union learning representatives: facilitating professional\ndevelopment for Scottish teachers.
