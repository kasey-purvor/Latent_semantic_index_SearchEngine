Introduction \nLow thermal expansion glass and glass ceramics, such as ULE\u00ae and Zerodur\u00ae respectively, \nhave been employed for many years in the manufacturing of large optics. Currently, a number \nof projects are studying the possibility of making the next generation of European Extra Large \nTelescope. These generally follow the Keck hexagonal segmented mirror scheme. The \nsegments are expected to be in the size range 1-2.5 metres in glass, glass ceramic, ceramic or \nBeryllium [1]. Sagem and Kodak have reported manufacturing process concepts for making \n>1 metre hexagonal mirrors. The blank is progressively ground to reach the desired shape. \nThen, the mirror is lapped and polished to get the correct form geometry and to remove any \nsubsurface damage induced by previous machining process [2].  \nA possible production improvement is to achieve a grinding process that is capable of \nproducing better shaped surfaces having less subsurface damage and at higher material \nremoval rates. To achieve this production capability a new ultra precision large optics grinder \n[3] - BoX\u00ae - has been developed at Cranfield University. A 5-axis Holroyd Edgetek grinding \nmachine with a dedicated fixture has been used in advance in order to validate the BoX\u00ae \ngrinding mode. The grinding forces and power [4] as well as the wheel wear [5] induced by \nthis particular grinding mode were previously discussed.  \nThe purpose of the work described in this paper has been to establish the level of \nsubsurface damage (SSD) in ULE\u00ae and Zerodur\u00ae using different material removal rates. A \ncomparison of surface roughness and SSD qualities, for ULE\u00ae and Zerodur\u00ae, is provided in \nassociation with grinding parameters. \n2. Theoretical details \n2.1 Brittle materials \nDuctile or brittle fracture mode grinding [6] can be used to machine brittle materials such as \nZerodur\u00ae and ULE\u00ae. Ductile mode grinding has been reported to give low SSD [7]. However, \nachievable material removal rate is low, as for example the critical depth of cut is ~50 nm on \nZerodur\u00ae [8]. Higher manufacturing rates are supported using micro brittle fracture grinding. \nHowever, the brittle mode leaves surface and subsurface damage on ground surfaces.  \nAn efficient grinding process requires optimisation of the grinding parameters to reduce \nthe level of SSD. Micro fracture mechanisms that lead to SSD in brittle materials have been \nextensively investigated by Lawn [9]. Median cracks commence and propagate with increase \nof indentation load. With indentation unloading, the median cracks close and lateral cracks \ngrow towards the surface. These fracture mechanisms result in surface and subsurface defects. \n2.2 Subsurface damage evaluation \nDifferent models to predict SSD have been proposed using the maximum chip thickness and \nthe material properties [10]. Other attempts to estimate the SSD have been proposed in order \nto correlate it with the abrasive grain size [11] or the surface roughness [12]. The importance \nof grinding machine performance has also been identified [13, 14]. Most recently, some work \ncarried out on Zerodur\u00ae using a 25 \u00b5m grit size wheel showed that subsurface damage was \nbelieved to be separable into \u2018Process\u2019 related and \u2018Machine dynamics\u2019 related [15]. \n#85518 - $15.00 USD Received 23 Jul 2007; revised 7 Sep 2007; accepted 8 Sep 2007; published 11 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 17 September 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 19 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12198\nIn order to measure the extent of subsurface cracks, different non-destructive and \ndestructive measurement methods have been developed. Some non-destructive subsurface \ninspection techniques [16], such as ultrasonic Rayleigh wave measurement, have proved \nsuccessful for information and qualification of significant and deep cracks. Destructive \nmethods have proved to be more successful for detecting micron and sub-micron scale \nfractures. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis has shown good \nresults for detection of sub-micron scale defects in glasses and crystals [17]. This TEM \nprocess is however time consuming and less appropriate for large defects in multi-phase \nadvanced ceramics. Repetitive polish, etch and optical microscopy have been widely \nemployed to observe SSD in ground glasses [18]. A variant of this repetitive polish and etch \nmethod [19] is a \u201cwedge\u201d polishing approach which simplifies assessment of how defect \ndensity relates to depth beneath the ground surface [20].  \nTwo terms were employed to describe the subsurface damage level. The majority of \nsubsurface cracks cluster together near the surface and terminate at a characteristic \u2018cluster \ndepth\u2019. A small minority of cracks propagate deeper beneath the surface. The \u2018single last \nfracture depth\u2019 is usually much deeper than the cluster depth and corresponds to the deepest \npenetration of such cracks into the sample [12]. \n3. Experimental details \n3.1 Specimens and grinding equipment \nZerodur\u00ae and ULE\u00ae specimens used in these tests were 100 mm x 100 mm x 20 mm. \nTable 1.

A \nfixture was added on the grinding table so that the material blank can be tilted at 70\u00b0 to the \nhorizontal (the grinding spindle axis is horizontal). The fixture recreates the 20\u00b0 wheel tilt \nangle employed on the BoX\u00ae machine and employs a vacuum system to hold the test samples \nin place (Fig. 1). \n \n         \nFig. 1. (a).

Wheel details are given in Table 2. A nickel \nelectroplated wheel with 181\u00b5m diamond grit size was employed to true and form the \ngrinding wheels\u2019 cross sections to a 300mm radius. \nTable 2.

Before each \ncut, the wheel was \u2018dressed\u2019 by plunging into a dressing stick. The coolant employed \nthroughout was a water based fluid with 2% Dowel. To achieve a relatively laminar flow, the \npressure was set to 2 Bar. A slot nozzle design was chosen to provide \u2018laminar like\u2019 flow over \nthe large engagement zone. All tests used a 30m\/s grinding speed (vs). The surface roughness \nand surface waviness of specimens were assessed using a Form Talysurf profilometer. The \nstylus used was a 2\u00b5m radius conisphere diamond. The values of surface roughness (Ra) and \nsurface profile (Pt) parameters were used to characterise the surface quality. \n3.2 Grinding mode and grinding parameters \nThe grinding mode used in these tests (Fig. 2) corresponds to the BoX\u00ae grinding mode [3]. \nThis type of grinding mode has previously been described in the use of the Large Optical \nGenerator [23] as well as the grinding of aspherical optical components [24]. \n \nae \nVw \nfr \n\u2019scallop\u2019 \nshape Rc \nc\nR\nr\nf\nt\nP\n\u00d7\n\u2248\n8\n2\n [22] \n    \n \nFig. 2.

Surface Responses \n \nThe values show good correlation with equations developed for other processes of surface \ngeneration [25]. For the finish cut, the profile value is noticeably influenced by the errors, \nparticularly in respect of scallop to scallop height consistency. Examination of a Form \nTalysurf profile [5] shows that the bottoms of each ground cusp are distributed around the \naverage surface line by approximately 2 \u03bcm p-v. This is as a result of error motion of the \ngrinding machine\u2019s axes at these high force levels; this effect is at least partially a function of \nstatic and dynamic stiffness of the machine. The difference between ULE\u00ae and Zerodur\u00ae is \nimportant when considering surface roughness \u2018along vw\u2019 but less significant for the surface \nprofile.  \n4.2 Subsurface damage assessment \n4.2.1 Surface preparation \n \n        \nFig. 3.

The depth of the wedge was obtained using a profilometer. \nEtching of the polished \u2018wedge\u2019 was made using a HF\/HCl solution on Zerodur\u00ae and a HF \nsolution on ULE\u00ae. Etching rate on ground surfaces was established to choose an adequate and \nsafe etching time. The etching times were set to 10 and 30 seconds which removes \napproximately 1\u00b5m and 0.5\u00b5m depth on Zerodur\u00ae and on ULE\u00ae respectively.  \nFigure 4 shows an example of the SSD in a Zerodur\u00ae and ULE\u00ae sample after etching. \nLabels on zones in Fig. 4 indicate distance along the wedge in mm, then depth in \u00b5m.

It is interesting to note that the amount of defects per mm2 \nreduces dramatically before this last crack. The \u2018cluster depth\u2019 is significantly influenced by \nreducing the abrasive size. However, an influence of abrasive size on SSD in respect of the \n\u2018single last fracture depth\u2019 is not clearly apparent. By contrast, a relationship between \u2018single \nlast fracture depth\u2019 and material type is indicated.   \nA small number of samples were investigated due to the time consuming process of \nanalysis. For the finish cut using the D25 wheel, the process was repeated once for each \nmaterial; with the D46 and D76 wheels, one sample was used for each. To improve these \ninitial findings, further work will be carried out in order to obtain statistical data. \nTable 5 shows the SSD measured relative to the grinding parameters used for ULE\u00ae and \nZerodur\u00ae. \nTable 5.

However, for all other \nconditions the subsurface damage found in ULE\u00ae is higher than in Zerodur\u00ae. This can be \nexplained by relating the level of subsurface damage to the brittleness of the material. A crack \nis less likely to be created in ULE\u00ae but it is more easily propagated once the load becomes \nsignificant.  \nAs Zhang [14] showed in ceramics, a lower brittleness value and higher grit size lead to \nhigher SSD. However, the lower SSD level obtained for the rough cut using the 76 \u00b5m grit \nsize wheel shows that there are other important parameters to look at when assessing SSD. \nThe degree to which densification of ULE\u00ae influences both its brittleness value and its \nresponse to the finishing operation is not known at this stage. \nBy plotting the number of defects per mm\u00b2 against the distance from the surface using a \nlogarithmic scale, two zones can be identified, see Fig. 7(b). \na) \n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nDistance from the surface (\u00b5m)\nNu\nm\nbe\nr \nof\n d\nef\nec\nts\n \n\/ m\nm\n2\ngroove 1 (sample 1)\ngroove 2 (sample 1)\ngroove 1 (sample 2)\ngroove 2 (sample 2)\n \nb) \n1\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n100000\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nDistance from the surface (\u00b5m)\nN\nu\nm\nbe\nr o\nf d\nef\nec\nts\n \n\/ m\nm\n2\ngroove 1 (sample 1)\ngroove 2 (sample 1)\ngroove 1 (sample 2)\ngroove 2 (sample 2)\nZone 2\n'Machine dynamics' related\nZone 1\n'Process' related\nsdprocess\n \nFig. 7. \u2018Process\u2019 related and \u2018Machine dynamics\u2019 related zones (finish cut - D25) \u2013 a) ULE\u00ae b) \nZerodur\u00ae \n \nIn Fig. 7(b) for Zerodur\u00ae, first the number of defects decreases rapidly (Zone 1) then it \nfollows another distinct trend (Zone 2). Zone 1 is believed to be \u2018process\u2019 related and Zone 2 \nto be \u2018machine dynamics\u2019 related. The transition point between these two zones has been \ndefined as sdprocess. This is also the \u201ccluster\u201d depth in this case, which the authors believe is an \nartefact of process conditions only and not machine related. For Zerodur\u00ae, the value of sdprocess \nusing the D25 wheel under \u201cfinish cut\u201d conditions is 4 \u03bcm. The machine dynamics \nperformance is therefore considered to be of significant importance. For the particular case of \na finer grit size, 25 \u03bcm, ULE\u00ae seems to be less responsive to the machine dynamics. This is \nbelieved to be due to longer cracks, resulting from easier propagation in ULE\u00ae as observed in \n#85518 - $15.00 USD Received 23 Jul 2007; revised 7 Sep 2007; accepted 8 Sep 2007; published 11 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 17 September 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 19 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12204\nFigures 3-4. The transition between Zone 1 and Zone 2 is unclear and further work will be \nneeded to identify this value. The unclustered cracks, assumed to be \u2018machine dynamics\u2019 \nrelated, occur deeper beneath the surface in Zerodur\u00ae. Further results obtained using a \ndynamically stiff grinding machine, having smoother motion control, e.g. the BoX\u00ae machine, \nshould clearly test this hypothesis. \n6 Conclusions \nThe purpose of this research is to reduce to a minimum the required time for any subsequent \npolishing process. A high material removal rate at 187.5mm3\/s has been demonstrated using \nresin bonded diamond wheels on Zerodur\u00ae and ULE\u00ae.  \nAchieved surface roughness and subsurface damage levels using the finer grit wheel (D25) \nduring finish cuts were 124 nm (Ra) and 6.6 \u03bcm respectively for ULE\u00ae. For Zerodur\u00ae, these \nresults were 137 nm (Ra) and 9.5 \u03bcm respectively.  \nOur work shows the value of the \u201cwedge\u201d polishing technique to assess the amount of \ndamage under a ground ULE\u00ae or Zerodur\u00ae surface. As previously discussed for Zerodur\u00ae \n[20], these results show that for ULE\u00ae the number of defects apparent at different depths \nbeneath the surface is a combined function of \u2018process\u2019 related and \u2018machine dynamics\u2019 \nrelated damage. However, the material brittleness is believed to give further understanding of \nthe distribution of the numbers of defects beneath the surface. A low brittleness value will \ngive longer cracks that combine with \u2018machine dynamics\u2019 related cracks. More aggressive \ngrinding parameters, in particular coarser grit sizes, can leave more and deeper cracks which \nreduce the importance of the \u2018machine dynamics\u2019 related damage in preliminary or rough \ngrinding. Additional work will be carried out in order to develop a model relating subsurface \ndamage to both \u2018process\u2019 related and \u2018machine dynamics\u2019 related issues. This model will be \ndeveloped by performing the same grinding tests using the stiffer, hydrostatic bearing based \ngrinding machine in order to prove the extent of machine dynamics effects in regard to the \nsubsurface damage defects profile. \nAcknowledgments \nThe authors would like to acknowledge project funding through the UK\u2019s Joint Research \nCouncils\u2019 Basic Technologies programme and funding support from the McKeown Precision \nEngineering and Nanotechnology Foundation at Cranfield. \n#85518 - $15.00 USD Received 23 Jul 2007; revised 7 Sep 2007; accepted 8 Sep 2007; published 11 Sep 2007\n(C) 2007 OSA 17 September 2007 \/ Vol. 15,  No. 19 \/ OPTICS EXPRESS  12205\n"}
