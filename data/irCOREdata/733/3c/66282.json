The experiment used data gathered\nby the Iceland Hotspot Project, which operated a 35-station network of continuously\nrecording, digital, broad-band seismometers over all of Iceland 1996\u20131998. The\nstructure of the upper mantle was determined using the ACH damped least-squares\nmethod and involved 42 stations, 3159 P-wave, and 1338 S-wave arrival times, including\nthe phases P, pP, sP, PP, SP, PcP, PKIKP, pPKIKP, S, sS, SS, SKS and Sdiff.\nArtefacts, both perceptual and parametric, were minimized by well-tested smoothing\ntechniques involving layer thinning and offset-and-averaging. Resolution is good beneath\nmost of Iceland from y60 km depth to a maximum of y450 km depth and beneath the\nTjornes Fracture Zone and near-shore parts of the Reykjanes ridge. The results reveal a\ncoherent, negative wave-speed anomaly with a diameter of 200\u2013250 km and anomalies\nin P-wave speed, VP, as strong as x2.7 per cent and in S-wave speed, VS, as strong as\nx4.9 per cent. The anomaly extends from the surface to the limit of good resolution at\ny450 km depth. In the upper y250 km it is centred beneath the eastern part of the\nMiddle Volcanic Zone, coincident with the centre of the y100 mGal Bouguer gravity\nlow over Iceland, and a lower crustal low-velocity zone identified by receiver functions.\nThis is probably the true centre of the Iceland hotspot. In the upper y200 km, the low-\nwave-speed body extends along the Reykjanes ridge but is sharply truncated beneath the\nTjornes Fracture Zone. This suggests that material may flow unimpeded along the\nReykjanes ridge from beneath Iceland but is blocked beneath the Tjornes Fracture Zone.\nThe magnitudes of the VP, VS and VP \/VS anomalies cannot be explained by elevated\ntemperature alone, but favour a model of maximum temperature anomalies <200 K,\nalong with up to y2 per cent of partial melt in the depth range y100\u2013300 km beneath\neast-central Iceland. The anomalous body is approximately cylindrical in the top 250 km\nbut tabular in shape at greater depth, elongated north\u2013south and generally underlying\nthe spreading plate boundary. Such a morphological change and its relationship to\nsurface rift zones are predicted to occur in convective upwellings driven by basal heating,\npassive upwelling in response to plate separation and lateral temperature gradients.\nAlthough we cannot resolve structure deeper than y450 km, and do not detect a\nbottom to the anomaly, these models suggest that it extends no deeper than the mantle\ntransition zone. Such models thus suggest a shallow origin for the Iceland hotspot rather\nthan a deep mantle plume, and imply that the hotspot has been located on the spreading\nridge in the centre of the north Atlantic for its entire history, and is not fixed relative to\nother Atlantic hotspots. The results are consistent with recent, regional full-thickness\nmantle tomography and whole-mantle tomography images that show a strong, low-\nwave-speed anomaly beneath the Iceland region that is confined to the upper mantle and\nGeophys. J. Int. (2001) 146, 504\u2013530\n504 # 2001 RAS\nthus do not require a plume in the lower mantle. Seismic and geochemical observations\nthat are interpreted as indicating a lower mantle, or core\u2013mantle boundary origin for\nthe North Atlantic Igneous Province and the Iceland hotspot should be re-examined to\nconsider whether they are consistent with upper mantle processes.\nKey words: hotspot, Iceland, seismic tomography, upper mantle, plume.\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nArthur Holmes was the first influential advocate of convection\nwithin the Earth, a process that later became generally accepted\nas the physical basis for Wegener\u2019s theory of continental drift\n(Holmes 1931). Very early, the convection hypothesis was\naccepted by German geodesists, who surmised that the rift zones\nof Iceland might overlie upwelling limbs and be widening, with\nmagma rising passively to fill the space created (Bernauer 1943).\nIt is now accepted that subducting slabs comprise the descending\nlimbs of a convecting system, but the nature of the ascending\nflow at spreading ridges and hotspots, and the depths from\nwhich material rises, are still poorly understood.\nMagmas at spreading ridges are thought to be of relatively\nshallow origin, perhaps no deeper than y100 km (e.g. Shen\n& Forsyth 1995). Subducted slabs, however, are known from\nearthquake activity and full-thickness mantle tomography\nto extend much deeper (Grand 1994). Spreading ridges thus\nappear not to involve upwellings on the same depth scale as\ndowngoing slabs. It was originally suggested by Wilson (1963)\nand Morgan (1971, 1972) that hot material rises from the\ndeep mantle to the surface of the Earth in jets or vertical, cylin-\ndrical \u2018plumes\u2019. This hypothesis has gained wide acceptance,\nand has been invoked to explain large-scale geological and\ngeophysical features such as large igneous provinces and geoid,\ntopographic and geochemical anomalies. However, few obser-\nvations require that magma rises in plumes from great depth.\nWhole-mantle tomography, for example, suggests that deep\nupwellings are very broad and diffuse, although the spatial\nresolution of those models cannot rule out narrow structures.\nAlternatives to the plume model that involve only relatively\nshallow processes have been proposed (e.g. King & Anderson\n1998). The plume hypothesis is an elegant tenet that has achieved\nwidespread acceptance, but it is unproven. It should thus not\ngo unchallenged. Alternative models should be considered.\nSeismic studies seeking mantle plumes include whole-mantle\ntomography, regional full-thickness mantle tomography, tele-\nseismic tomography involving regional-scale seismic networks,\nand experiments focusing on specific plume markers. Tabular,\nhigh-wave-speed lithospheric slabs have been imaged beneath\nmajor subduction zones (e.g. van der Hilst et al. 1997; Fukao\net al. 1992). However, negative wave-speed anomalies with\nthe vertical, cylindrical morphology traditionally expected of\nplumes have not been detected. Three candidate bodies have\nbeen reported to date, one y2000 km wide arising from the\ncore\u2013mantle boundary beneath the South Atlantic and extend-\ning obliquely to the Earth\u2019s surface beneath East Africa, and\ntwo beneath the Pacific ocean (e.g. Ritsema et al. 1999; Megnin\n& Romanowicz 2000). However, none has a simple, traditional\nplume shape, width or geometry or can be explained as a\nthermal plume (Tackley 1998; van der Hilst & Karason 1999;\nMegnin & Romanowicz 2000).\nFor most hotspots there is no seismic evidence for a deep-\nseated origin. The best studied is the Iceland hotspot. Several\nindependent, regional full-thickness mantle tomography and\nwhole-mantle tomography studies have imaged a strong, broad,\nlow-wave-speed upper mantle anomaly that occupies most of\nthe north Atlantic at the latitude of Iceland (Hager & Clayton\n1989; Zhou 1996; Bijwaard & Spakman 1999; Ritsema et al.\n1999; Megnin & Romanowicz 2000; Karason & van der Hilst\n2001a,b). In contrast, the lower mantle is characterized by\nanomalies at least an order of magnitude weaker, with poor\nrepeatability of the details of individual features. The maxi-\nmum depth of good resolution of land-based, regional seismic\nexperiments in Iceland is limited to y450 km by the size of\nthe island, and thus such studies can only image reliably the\nupper mantle above the transition zone. A strong, negative\nwave-speed anomaly is invariably detected. Allen et al. (1999)\nreported that the attenuation pattern of teleseismic waves pass-\ning beneath Iceland indicates a body no more than y200 km\nwide and with an anomaly in VS of up to x12 per cent. This\nis considerably narrower and stronger than anomalies found\nin earlier teleseismic tomography experiments, which report\nbodies with diameters of 200\u2013400 km and VP anomalies of up\nto yx4 per cent (Tryggvason et al. 1983; Wolfe et al. 1997).\nInterpretations of these regional experiments did not consider\nalternative, non-plume hypotheses.\nWe report here the results of the largest teleseismic tomo-\ngraphy study yet performed of the upper mantle beneath\nIceland. Our study involves more stations and several times\nmore arrival times than have been used before, and includes\ndiverse seismic phases that improve resolving power. The results\nconfirm the presence of a negative wave-speed anomaly in the\nupper mantle, but show additionally that its gross morphology\nvaries with depth. The body is centred beneath east-central\nIceland and is consistent with elevated temperature and partial\nmelting. It extends beneath the Reykjanes ridge southwest\nof Iceland in the upper y200 km but terminates laterally\nat shallow depth beneath the Tjornes Fracture Zone north of\nIceland. The body is roughly cylindrical in the upper y250 km,\nbut at greater depth assumes a vertical, tabular morphology\nunderlying and approximately parallel to the spreading plate\nboundary. Such a change in shape is expected near the bottom\nof rising, buoyant bodies, and our observations thus suggest\nthat the negative wave-speed anomaly in the upper mantle\nbeneath Iceland does not extend into the lower mantle (Foulger\net al. 2000).\nT E C T O N I C S T R U C T U R E O F I C E L A N D\nIceland has east\u2013west and north\u2013south dimensions of y500\nand 350 km and lies on the spreading plate boundary in the\nnorth Atlantic. Over 30 spreading segments are exposed on\nland and comprise four major volcanic zones: the Northern,\nEastern, Western and Middle Volcanic Zones (NVZ, EVZ, WVZ\nand MVZ; Fig. 1; Saemundsson 1979). The currently active\nspreading zone is represented by the NVZ, which developed\nat y7 Ma with the abandonment of a zone 150 km further\nUpwelling beneath Iceland confined to upper mantle 505\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nto the west (Saemundsson et al. 1980). The NVZ is linked to\nthe offshore Kolbeinsey ridge by the y120 km long, right-\nlateral Tjornes Fracture Zone (TFZ). The EVZ, a southward-\npropagating rift, is currently growing at the expense of the\ndwindling WVZ (Sigmundsson et al. 1994). The WVZ is con-\nnected to the offshore spreading plate boundary, the Reykjanes\nridge, via the Reykjanes peninsula in southwest Iceland.\nThe Iceland hotspot is popularly thought, on the basis of\ngeochemistry and volcanic production rates, to be currently\ncentred beneath the northwest part of the Vatnajokull ice-cap\n(Schilling 1973; Sigvaldason et al. 1974). It has been suggested\nthat the hotspot has migrated east with respect to the oceanic\nplate boundary at a rate of y1 cm yrx1 over the last 55 Myr\n(Vink 1984), and that recently the spreading plate boundary in\nIceland has migrated with it. However, these models are based\non the assumption that the Iceland hotspot has remained fixed\nrelative to other Atlantic hotspots. Furthermore, the shape of\nthe edge of the Iceland plateau is consistent with the centre\nof volcanism having been relatively stationary with respect to\nthe plate boundary over the last 26 Myr (Bott 1985).\nD A T A A C Q U I S I T I O N\nThe objective of the Iceland Hotspot Project is to study the crust\nand upper mantle beneath Iceland. A network of 35 digital\nbroad-band seismic stations was operated from June 1996 to\nAugust 1998\u2014the largest deployment of such instruments ever\nin Iceland (Fig. 1). A primary objective was to perform tele-\nseismic tomography of the highest quality practical. The greatest\ndepth that may be imaged using this method is approxi-\nmately equal to the network aperture, and we maximized this\nby deploying sensors from coast to coast, including one on\nthe island of Grimsey north of Iceland. The network comple-\nmented the permanent Icelandic SIL (South Iceland Lowland)\nnetwork (Stefa\u00b4nsson et al. 1993), from which data were also\ndrawn. Particularly challenging was the deployment of station\n23 at Grimsfjall, a nunatak on the caldera rim of the Grimsvotn\nvolcano, within the Vatnajokull icecap. Bedrock is exposed\nthere because the ground is warmed by geothermal heat from\nthe Grimsvotn volcano. This station was deployed two months\nprior to, and at a distance of 5 km from, the eruption of\nthe subglacial volcano Gjalp in September and October 1996\n(Gudmundsson et al. 1997), and resulted in the serendipitous\nacquisition of an excellent seismic data set of volcanic earthquakes\nand tremor.\nThe equipment used was supplied by the IRIS\u2013PASSCAL\nconsortium. We used 24-bit REFTEK 72 A-08 data loggers\nrecording a continuous data stream at 20 samples sx1 on\n0.66\u20131.2 Gbyte disks.

The CMG-40T sensors are\ncompact and suitable for outdoors deployments where vaults\nhave to be excavated. Microseisms are strong in Iceland, and\ndominated the noise compared to instrumental effects. Timing\nand station locations were provided by GPS clocks.\nMost of the coastal zone in Iceland is populated, so we were\nable to deploy most of the stations in buildings, either on bed-\nrock exposed in basements or on concrete floors laid directly\nonto bedrock. At these sites, mains power was used, and backup\npower was provided by trickle-charged batteries. Five broad-\nband sensors were deployed in existing vaults of the Icelandic\nSIL network. Those data were sampled at 100 samples sx1 and\nstored in a ring buffer from which earthquakes of interest\nwere extracted on a daily basis. The SIL data were resampled\nat 20 samples sx1 for this study. The interior of Iceland is\nunpopulated and not served by mains electricity, but in order to\nachieve uniform coverage, five stations were deployed there.\nWe deployed the recorders in mountain huts that were selected\nfor regularity of spacing and suitability for winter maintenance\nvisits by a team of field workers in specially equipped snow jeeps.\nWinter-time power was the limiting factor at those stations, and\nbanks of eight 150 amp hr batteries were used, trickle charged\nby four to eight 30 W solar panels.\nAll stations were visited at 6\u201312 week intervals. Data\nwere dumped from field disks and archived in Reykjavik.\nEarthquakes were extracted on a monthly basis using event\nlists from the National Earthquake Information Centre (NEIC)\nand the Meteorological Office of Iceland, which operates the\nSIL network. We achieved an average of 86 per cent uptime for\nour stations. The most serious causes of data loss were lack of\npower at the interior stations, and malfunctioning of elements\nin outdoor excavated pits that were inaccessible throughout the\nwinter because of frozen ground. The final data archive comprises\ny200 Gbytes of data compressed with the Steim algorithm\n(Halbert et al. 1988), and is publicly available over the inter-\nnet from the IRIS\u2013PASSCAL Consortium Data Management\nCenter.\nD A T A P R O C E S S I N G\nTeleseismic earthquake arrival times were measured on rotated\nseismograms using the interactive computer program dbpick\n(Harvey & Quinlan 1996). The signal-to-noise ratio of seismic\nrecordings in Iceland is degraded by microseismic and wind-\ngenerated noise, but the 2 yr deployment period was sufficient\nto gather excellent recordings of more than 120 teleseisms. Using\npreliminary arrival times computed using the IASP91 earth\nmodel (Kennett & Engdahl 1991) and NEIC final locations,\ntraces were time-shifted to align the first-arriving P phase to\nfacilitate waveform comparison. Phases picked were P, pP, sP,\nPP, SP, PcP, PKIKP, pPKIKP, S, sS, SS, SKS and Sdiff.\n(Table 1). For the final inversion we selected picks made in\nthe frequency band 0.5\u20132.0 Hz for P waves and 0.05\u20130.1 Hz\nfor S waves. We picked by hand for consistency, since initial\ntrials with numerical cross-correlation revealed that frequent\ncycle misidentification occurred. Furthermore, algorithms that\ncorrelate several cycles of waveforms introduce systematic\nerrors, since later cycles include crustal reverberations and\nmultipathing, which vary across a large network deployed in an\ninhomogeneous region. Such errors may distort final models\nmore seriously than the slightly larger but random errors in\nhand picks. We measured times of the first trough or peak\nrelative to the phase of interest, with an estimated accuracy of\ny0.05 s for P phases and y0.5 s for S phases. Weights were\nassigned to picks on the basis of qualitative judgement of the\nclarity of the phases. Traveltime residuals were calculated by\nsubtracting the arrival times predicted by the IASP91 model\nfrom each observed time.\nThe surface-reflected phases PP and SS are particularly\nvaluable because, for a given epicentral distance, they have\nlarger slownesses than most other teleseismic body phases and\ncan therefore help to increase vertical resolution where earth-\nquakes at small epicentral distances are sparse, as is the case\nfor Iceland. In particular, use of PP and SS phases can reduce\nvertical smearing, and help to distinguish true vertical structures\nfrom artefacts of poor resolution. The results of previous\nstudies of mantle structure beneath Iceland are open to question,\npartly because of failure to use such phases (Keller et al. 2000).\nAt the same time, however, surface-reflected phases introduce\ntheir own problems because their rays are not minimum-time\npaths. Reflections from points on the surface other than the\ngeometrical ray bounce-point can arrive before the geometrical\narrival, so signals tend to have emergent beginnings whose\nabsolute onset times are difficult to measure. Relative arrival\ntimes must thus be measured for peaks or troughs later in the\nwaveform, which are more subject to contamination by crustal\nstructure variations and multipathing. In this study, we used\nPP phases from 33 earthquakes and SS phases from 14. To\nminimize the errors discussed above, we used only phases with\nhigh signal-to-noise ratios and waveforms that were coherent\nfrom station to station.\nIn a data set of this size, some measurements inevitably have\nlarge errors, caused, for example, by comparing different peaks\nor troughs at different stations, and it is important to identify\nand remove such outliers. This can be done by comparing the\npatterns of arrival-time anomalies at different stations for earth-\nquakes with similar locations. For such a collection of events,\nthe ray paths beneath the network are similar, and therefore, in\nthe absence of errors, the pattern of arrival-time anomalies is\nalso similar. We divided the phases into 10 azimuth\u2013slowness\nbins for P and nine for S (Fig. 2) and analysed each bin\nseparately. Fig. 3 shows an example of a single bin of P waves\narriving from the east-northeast. The ordinate for each symbol\ngives the arrival-time anomaly minus the median value for the\nevent for all stations. The median value plotted for each event is\nTable 1.

R. Foulger et al.\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nT O M O G R A P H Y M E T H O D\nTo invert the arrival-time anomalies and determine 3-D\nstructure, we used the \u2018ACH\u2019 damped-least-squares method\nof Aki et al. (1977). In particular, we used a version of the\ncomputer program thrd that had been modified to correct a\ngeometrical error that is important at high latitudes (Julian\net al. 2001). A comprehensive description of the method and\napplication is given by Evans & Achauer (1993). The ACH\nmethod uses data from a network of seismic stations whose\naperture is small compared with the distances to the sources.\nThe 3-D structure is represented as a stack of layers, each\ndivided into homogeneous rectangular blocks. The optimum\nblock size depends on the station spacing. Blocks should have\nhorizontal dimensions of approximately the average station\nspacing, and layers should initially have thicknesses about 1.5\ntimes this width. The method requires that all rays enter the\nstudy volume through its base, so the model cannot extend\ndeeper than the turning point of the shallowest incoming ray.\nWell-conditioned experiments involve rays distributed widely\nin azimuth\u2013slowness space, and thus the study volume is a\ntruncated cone that broadens downwards.\nThe ACH method perturbs an initial 1-D wave-speed model\nto minimize the arrival-time anomalies in the least-squares\nsense. Only in those places where there are many crossing rays,\nwell distributed in azimuth and slowness, is the structure well\nresolved. The near surface, where there are no crossing rays, is\ntreated differently, by solving for a single wave-speed anomaly\nin a cone beneath each station (a \u2018special first layer\u2019). A key\nassumption is that delays caused by structure outside the study\nvolume are the same for all stations for a particular event\nand phase. Clearly this is only an approximation, and hetero-\ngeneities outside the study volume can introduce spurious\nanomalies into peripheral parts of the final images (Evans &\nAchauer 1993). These parts must thus be viewed with caution.\nFurthermore, the method computes the effects of changing\nwave speeds in the blocks by applying Fermat\u2019s Principle\nto ray paths appropriate to the initial 1-D, layered structure,\nand thus ignores the second-order effect of refraction of rays\nby horizontal variations in wave speed. The severity of this\napproximation depends on both the magnitude of the wave-\nspeed anomalies and their geometry. Because the rays follow\nminimum-time paths, regions of high wave speed are sampled\nmost heavily, and the wave speeds in the derived models tend to\nbe overestimated. In practice, the errors introduced have been\nfound to be negligible if wave-speed anomalies are less than\ny5 per cent (Steck & Prothero 1991), which is the case for the\nupper mantle beneath Iceland.\nTo choose optimum block sizes and damping parameters, we\nperformed trial inversions using layers 100 km thick and blocks\n100, 75 and 50 km wide (Pritchard 2000). In all cases, the\nhomogeneous cones used to approximate variations in crustal\nstructure beneath the stations were taken to be 10 km high.\nAs a starting model, we used a layered approximation to the\nIASP91 wave-speed model. We performed a suite of inversions\nvarying only the damping parameter, and studied the trade-\noff between residual variance and the square of the Euclidean\nlength of the model vector m. A damping-parameter value of\n400 s2 per centx2 provided a reasonable trade-off between data\nfit and model complexity.\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\nR\ne\nla\nti\nv\ne\nre\ns\nid\nu\na\nl\n(s\n)\n1 1\n1\n1\n1\n1 1 1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2 2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3 3 3 3 3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3\n3 3\n3\n3 3\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n4 4\n4 4\n4\n4\n4\n4 4\n4\n4 4\n4\n5\n5\n5\n5 5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5 5\n5\n5\n5 5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n6\n7\n7\n8\n8 8\n8\n8\n8\n8\n8 8\n8\n8\n8\n8 8\n8 8\n8 8\n8\n8\n8\n9\n9 9\n9 9\n9 9\n9\n9 9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n9\n10\n10 10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10 10\n10 10\n10\n10\n11\n11\n11 11\n11\n11\n11 11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11\n11 11 11\n12\n12\n12 12\n12\n12\n2\n12\n12\n2 12\n12\n12\n12\n12\n2\n12\n12\n12 12 12\n2\n12 12 12\n13 3\n13\n3\n13\n13 13 13\n13\n13\n13\n13 13 13\n3\n13\n3\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n13 13 13\n13\n13\n13\n13\n4\n14\n4\n14 14\n14\n4\n14\n14\n14 4\n4\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n14\n4\n4\n4\n14\n4\n15\n15\n15\n5\n5\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n5\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15\n15 15\n16\n6 16\n6\n16\n16\n6\n6\n6\n16\n16\n17\n7\n17\n7\n17\n17\n17\n17\n17\n17\n17\n7\n17\n7\n7 17\n7\n17 7\n17\n18\n19\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n20\n21\n21\n1\n21\n21\n1\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21 21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n21\n1\n2\n22\n22\n22\n22 22\n22 22\n22\n22\n22\n22 22\n22\n22\n22 2223\n23\n23 3\n23\n23 23 23\n23\n23\n23\n23\n3\n2\n23\n23 23 3\n3\n23\n23\n23\n23\n23\n23\n23 23 23\n24\n24 24\n4\n24 24\n4\n24\n24\n24\n24\n24 24\n24 24\n24 24 24\n24\n24\n4\n24\n24 24\n25\n25\n2 5\n5\n25 5 5\n25\n25\n25\n5\n5\n5\n25\n25\n25 5\n25\n25\n25\n25\n5\n25\n25\n25\n25\n26 26\n6\n6\n26\n26\n26 26 6\n6 6\n26\n26\n26\n26\n6\n26\n26 26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n26\n6\n26\n6\n6\nH\nO\nT\n0\n8\nH\nO\nT\n0\n9\nH\nO\nT\n1\n0\nH\nO\nT\n0\n7\nH\nO\nT\n0\n6\nH\nO\nT\n0\n4\nH\nO\nT\n1\n1\nH\nO\nT\n0\n3\nH\nO\nT\n0\n2\nA\nS\nB\nH\nO\nT\n0\n5\nH\nO\nT\n0\n1\nH\nO\nT\n3\n0\nV\nO\nG\nK\nR\nO\nH\nO\nT\n2\n8\nH\nV\nE\nS\nK\nR\nH\nO\nT\n2\n6\nH\nO\nT\n2\n7\nH\nO\nT\n1\n4\nH\nO\nT\n1\n3\nH\nO\nT\n1\n2\nS\nIG\nG\nR\nI\nG\nR\nA\nR\nE\nN\nK\nR\nA\nG\nIL\nH\nO\nT\n1\n5\nH\nO\nT\n2\n9\nG\nR\nS\nH\nO\nT\n1\n6\nH\nO\nT\n1\n7\nH\nO\nT\n1\n8\nH\nO\nT\n2\n4\nH\nO\nT\n2\n5\nH\nO\nT\n1\n9\nH\nO\nT\n2\n3\nH\nO\nT\n2\n0\nH\nO\nT\n2\n1\nH\nO\nT\n2\n2\nFigure 3.

Foulger et al.\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nThe ACH method is prone to non-linear effects that can\nintroduce distortion into 3-D models. The effect whereby the\nsensitivity of the method to features smaller than the block size\ndepends on their position with respect to the block boundaries\nis known as the \u2018disappearing anomaly\u2019 effect. An anomaly\nnear the centre of a block can be resolved more easily than one\nnear a block corner. We dealt with this problem by applying the\n\u2018offset-and-averaging\u2019 procedure of Evans & Achauer (1993).\nThe original grid is offset by 1\/n times the block size along each\nhorizontal axis, where n is a small integer, and an additional\nn2x1 offset models are computed. The final model is the\naverage of all n2 models. This averaging also smoothes the\nmodel horizontally.\nIn order to smooth the model vertically, to remove visual\nartefacts, we used \u2018layer thinning\u2019 (Evans & Achauer 1993).\nThis procedure involves performing a final inversion with\nlayers thinner by a factor of m, a small integer, than the initial\nvalue used (which in the case of this study was 100 km). The\ndamping parameter must simultaneously be reduced by about\na factor of m to compensate for the increased number of\nblocks in the model. For our layer-thinned inversions we used\nm=2 and a damping value of 225 s2 per centx2. Increasing\nthe number of blocks reduces the number of rays per block,\nand thus reduces formal statistical resolution. However, using\nsynthetic tests, Evans & Achauer (1993) showed that layer\nthinning yields vertical smoothing without loss of ability to\nretrieve true Earth structure, so that the equivalent spatial\nresolution of the layer-thinned models is the same as that of\nfull-thickness layer models.\nWe performed a suite of inversions with block widths of 100,\n75 or 50 km and layer thicknesses of 100, 50 or 33 km, both\nwith and without offset-and-averaging, for n=2 (Pritchard\n2000). Agreement of the overall results between inversions was\ngood for the first-order features we interpret in this paper.\nPritchard (2000) showed additionally models with 100 km wide\nblocks and 100 km thick layers that yielded smooth, averaged\nstructures, and models with 50 km wide blocks and 33 km\nthick layers that yielded noisier results. Our preferred final VP\nand VS models used offset-and-averaging with n=2, blocks\n75 km wide and layers 50 km thick (Fig. 5), a compromise\nbetween under-modelling the data and over-modelling noise.\nFor the original models, the initial and final rms arrival-time\nanomalies for P waves are 0.49 and 0.19 s, and for S waves 3.27\nand 1.08 s. The 3-D models thus give data variance reductions\nof 84 per cent for P and 89 per cent for S. Values for the offset-\nand-averaged models are expected to be approximately the\nsame.\nWe studied four measures of inversion quality. The hit-count\n(the number of rays sampling each block) is shown for P and S\nwaves in Figs 6 and 7 for the model with 75 km wide blocks\nand 100 km thick layers. The whole of Iceland is well sampled\nfrom the surface down to y450 km depth. Below this, the\nbest-sampled areas are to the north of Iceland, where blocks\ndown to over 600 km depth are sampled by >100 P waves and\n>50 S waves, and to the southwest of Iceland.\nHit-count is a poor indicator of resolving power because\nthe locations of anomalies can be determined well only if the\nstructure is sampled by crossing rays. Arrival times measured\nfrom a bundle of quasi-parallel rays can detect the existence\na wave-speed anomaly but are insensitive to its position along\nthe ray bundle. More detailed information is provided by the\nresolution matrix R (Evans & Achauer 1993, eq. 13.18), which\nspecifies the mapping between the \u2018true\u2019 Earth m and the\ninversion result m\u02c6,\nm^ \u00bc Rm : (1)\nR is based on assumptions, most notably that the true Earth\nconsists of homogeneous blocks and that ray theory accurately\ndescribes the paths of seismic waves. The diagonal elements of\nthe resolution matrix provide relative measures of the ability\nof the data set to detect anomalies in different locations. Figs 8\nand 9 show the diagonal elements ofR for VP and VS for 75 km\nwide blocks and 100 km thick layers. These are good indicators\nof the quality of our preferred models with 50 km thick layers\n(Evans & Achauer 1993). The pictures are broadly similar\nfor VP and VS. Resolution greater than y0.8, which exists\nthroughout much of our models, is unusually good for studies\nof this kind. There is no resolution in the top y60 km of\nthe model since there are no crossing rays there. In the depth\nrange y60\u2013450 km, resolution is high beneath most of Iceland\nexcept in the upper 100 km beneath a small area in south\nIceland. Below 450 km, resolution decreases, and at great depth\nresolution is poor, the incoming rays diverge strongly and\nsmearing is strong.\nThe diagonal elements of the resolution matrix do not\ndescribe the tendency of an anomaly to be imaged in the wrong\nlocation along a ray bundle, i.e. the degree of smearing.

Because there are no\noutlying seismic stations at which to record waves traversing\nthe study volume, deep, peripheral blocks on the edges are\nsampled only by rays approaching from outside the study\nvolume. It is significant to our results that the radial smearing\nat the periphery is similar in all areas, and not greater in one\nquadrant than in another. Below y450 km the tendency for\ndownward smearing, and for structure outside the imaged\nvolume to map into the model, is strong. Thus, despite the\nrelatively high hit-counts and resolutions in some deeper areas,\nwe consider our models to be unreliable at depths >y450 km.\nIn order to increase our confidence in the large-scale first-\norder features of our models, we performed a fourth resolution\ntest for both VP and VS. We generated models containing hypo-\nthetical wave-speed anomalies, expressed in the block structure\nused in our inversions, and multiplied the models by the\ncomputed resolution matrices R (eq. 1) for 100 km thick layers\nwithout offset-and-averaging. The results show how hypo-\nthetical anomalies would be distorted in the tomographic\ninversion because of uneven sampling by the available seismic\nrays. This test is more powerful than one based only on the\ndiagonal elements of R, because it measures not only the\nsensitivity to an anomaly at a particular location, but also the\ntendency to generate spurious images in the wrong locations.\nWe tested whether we could faithfully image a simple,\nvertical, cylindrical, plume-like anomaly with constant wave\nspeeds inside and outside. Fig. 12 shows the results of such\na test for an anomaly with horizontal dimensions of 2r2\nblocks (150 kmr150 km) underlying central Iceland. The\nresult indicates that good resolution extends to depths of about\n500 km in both VP and VS, and that there is little tendency\nto distort the shape of the anomaly in any systematic way.\nWe performed tests of many such anomalies with different\ndiameters and locations, all of which confirm this conclusion.\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\nVp\nFigure 10. \u2018Volume metrics\u2019 for five blocks from the final VP model (75 km wide blocks, 50 km thick layers), as seen looking downwards from the\nsouthwest.

Foulger et al.\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nWe also tested the ability of our method to resolve structure\nbeneath the Tjo\u00a8rnes Fracture Zone to the north of Iceland. We\nfound that such structure in the upper 100\u2013300 km could be\nresolved clearly to a distance of y50 km north of Iceland. There\nwas no tendency for computed anomalies to be terminated\nartificially beneath the fracture zone.\nR E S U L T S\nOur final VP model is shown in Fig. 13. The most significant\nfeature is a coherent, low-VP body extending vertically down-\nwards beneath east-central Iceland. This anomaly has a strength\nof up to x2.7 per cent in the top layer (Fig. 13, layer L2), and\nup to x2.1 per cent in deeper layers.\nWave-speed variations in the special first layer are as strong\nas t5.5 per cent for VP and t8 per cent for VS, with little\nspatial coherence in their values (Fig. 13, layer L1). Recent\nexplosion seismology, surface wave and receiver function work\nsuggests that the crust is thickest (up to about 40 km) in central\nIceland and thinner (around 25 km) beneath coastal areas\n(Darbyshire et al. 1998; Allen et al. 1999; Du & Foulger 1999,\n2001; Du et al. 2001). The wave-speed perturbations in the special\nfirst layer show only very broadly such a trend, suggesting that\nthey reflect mostly the very shallow structure of the upper\n10 km only. Crustal structure below this contributes to the top\nlayer of the tomographic image and to the strong VP anomalies\nimaged there. It is a common problem in teleseismic tomo-\ngraphy that few rays cross at shallow depths and shallow\nstructure is thus poorly resolved. When an independently\ndetermined model for the seismic structure of the crust over all\nof Iceland becomes available, it will be possible to overcome\nthis limitation by explicitly correcting for the crust in our model.\nThere are no crossing rays in the upper y60 km of the\nmodel, which includes layer 2. In this layer, the structure\ndetermined is thus the smoothed perturbation field obtained\nindependently for each station. The low-wave-speed anomaly is\nsharply truncated to the north, at the TFZ. It underlies the\nNVZ, EVZ and MVZ, and is centred easterly within the MVZ,\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-25\u00ca\n-20\u00ca\n-15\u00ca\n-10\u00ca\n60\u00ca\n62\u00ca\n64\u00ca\n66\u00ca\n68\u00ca\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\n-5\n0\n0-\n4\n0\n0-\n3\n0\n0-\n2\n0\n0-\n1\n0\n0\n0\nVs\nFigure 11.

A small, local,\nlow-VP anomaly occurs beneath the Northwest Fjords area.\nThe area where VP is depressed by more than 1 per cent relative\nto the surrounding areas has a diameter of 200\u2013250 km.\nIn the depth interval y50\u2013250 km, the low-VP anomaly\nunderlies northwest Vatnajokull, the NVZ, EVZ and MVZ\n(Fig. 13, layers L3\u2013L6). It extends beneath all of the MVZ at all\ndepths, but is not everywhere continuous beneath the NVZ and\nEVZ. As a result, it is elongated east\u2013west in some layers, most\nnotably at depths of y50\u2013100 and y150\u2013200 km. A weak\nlow-VP anomaly underlies the Reykjanes ridge, southwest of\nIceland, at all depths (Fig. 13, Section CCk). This part of our\nimage is peripheral and the least reliable. The TFZ, in contrast,\nis well resolved in the upper y450 km because of the presence\nof the station Grimsey off the north coast of the mainland\n(Fig. 1). The TFZ is underlain by relatively high-VP material in\nthe upper y100 km (Fig. 13, section AAk), but beneath this VP\nis low.\nBeneath y250 km, the morphology of the low-VP anomaly\nchanges systematically. Instead of being cylindrical, with a\nquasi-circular or east\u2013west elongated shape in map view, it\nbecomes elongated north\u2013south. This is clear in all horizontal\nsections below this depth, down to the limit of moderate\nresolution at y450 km (Fig. 13, layers L7\u2013L10). This change\nfrom cylindrical to tabular morphology is particularly clear\nin cross-section. Section AAk of Fig. 13 runs south\u2013north and\nclearly shows the anomaly widening with depth, whereas the\nwest\u2013east section DDk shows the anomaly narrowing with depth.\nThe volume metrics show an equal tendency for the inversion\nto smear anomalies radially outwards and downwards in all\ndirections, which suggests that this anomaly shape is not a result\nof smearing. Furthermore, images of hypothetical anomalies\n(Fig. 12) show no tendency to elongate real anomalies north\u2013\nsouth. This supports our inference that the azimuthally\nasymmetric morphology we observe is real.\nBecause the maximum aperture of our array is y450 km,\nstructure imaged at depths greater than this is poorly resolved,\nand heavily influenced by downward smearing. This is a conse-\nquence of the inherent geometric weakness of teleseismic tomo-\ngraphy, and stems from the fact that there are few crossing rays\nat great depth. Thus, despite the fact that the formal resolution\nis good in some parts of our model at greater depth, we do not\nattach significance to those parts of our model deeper than\ny450 km, but show these results for information only. The\nlow-wave-speed anomaly we image persists from the surface\ndown to at least y450 km depth, and thus our experiment does\nnot image the base of the anomaly.\nThe structure obtained for VS is shown in Fig. 14. Fewer\nS-wave than P-wave data were available, the picking accuracy\nwas poorer because of the longer wavelength of S waves, and\nthus the image obtained is poorer than the VP image. Most of\nthe first-order features of the two models agree well, however.\nAgain, the most obvious feature is a coherent, low-wave-speed\nbody that extends throughout all well-resolved depths. The VS\nanomaly has a strength of up to x4.9 per cent in the upper\ny300 km and it extends beneath the MVZ, the NVZ and\nVatnajokull (Fig. 14, layers L2\u2013L7). A weak low-VS anomaly\nunderlies the Northwest Fjords in the top y50 km. As with VP,\nthe VS anomaly in the depth interval y50\u2013200 km is circular\nin map view or slightly elongated east\u2013west. Low-VS material\nunderlies the Reykjanes ridge in the depth interval y50\u2013200 km,\nbut not at greater depths (Fig. 14, Section CCk). In this area,\nthe S-wave data set is larger than the P-wave data set and the\nmodel has better resolution. Beneath the TFZ, VS is reliably\nresolved and is high in the upper y100\u2013150 km. The low-VS\nanomaly beneath central Iceland extends beneath the TFZ only\nat depths greater than y150 km. As for VP, the VS anomaly\nbecomes tabular and oriented north\u2013south at depth (Fig. 14,\nSections AAk and DDk).\nFig. 15 shows the distribution of the ratio VP\/VS, represented\nas deviations from the IASP91 model (Fig. 16). The ratios\nshown are computed from the separate VP and VS models,\nobtained by adding the calculated anomalies to the IASP91\nstarting models. They are less well determined than either VP or\nVS because of the inhomogeneous sampling and resolution in\nthe two models, because teleseismic tomography only deter-\nmines wave-speed perturbations and is insensitive to absolute\nspeeds, and because the errors in both wave-speed models\ncontribute to the error in VP \/VS (the relative variances add),\nVar(VP=VS)\nV2P=V\n2\nS\n~\nVar(VP)\nV2P\nz\nVar(VS)\nV2S\n:\nFor this reason, VP \/VS is moderately well resolved only on\nthe scale of y100 km and only down to the limit of good\nresolution, i.e. y450 km depth.\nThe VP \/VS anomaly is i+1 per cent beneath much of\nIceland. It exceeds +3 per cent beneath the MVZ and northwest\nVatnajokull in the depth range y100\u2013200 km and beneath the\nMVZ, EVZ and NVZ in the depth range 200\u2013300 km. VP\/VS\nis also exceptionally high at depths of 100\u2013200 km beneath\nthe Reykjanes ridge, where the anomaly exceeds +2 per\ncent, but it is normal beneath the TFZ in the upper y100 km,\nand only slightly high at greater depth. In the depth range\ny300\u2013400 km, VP\/VS anomalies greater than +2 per cent are\nfound only in peripheral, less reliable parts of the model.\nIn addition to the first-order features described above,\nour VP, VS and VP\/VS models shown in Figs 13, 14 and 15\ndisplay small-scale, second-order features that have not been\nsuppressed by heavy smoothing in the inversion method as is\nthe case in some studies (e.g. Wolfe et al. 1997). The consistency\nof these features varies between inversions with different block\nsizes, damping, layer thicknesses and input data. These features\nare probably not all significant and may be due to data noise\nor to real structure, and we do not consider them sufficiently\nreliable to warrant detailed interpretation. Smoother and\nrougher inversion results obtained with different damping and\nparametrizations are given by Pritchard (2000).\nI N T E R P R E T A T I O N A N D D I S C U S S I O N\nThe main anomaly\nThe first-order observation is of a vertically extensive, low-\nwave-speed body centred beneath the middle of Iceland. In the\nupper y50 km, the body is centred easterly beneath the MVZ,\nnot beneath northwest Vatnajokull, where the hotspot centre is\ntraditionally assumed to lie. Our result agrees with gravity data\nand crustal structure. The centre of the Bouguer gravity low\nover Iceland lies in the eastern MVZ (Thorbergsson et al. 1990),\nwhere seismic receiver-function data show a thick, low-velocity\nzone in the lower crust (Du & Foulger 2001; Du et al. 2001).\nLow wave speeds are present at all depths beneath the MVZ,\nand a positive VP \/VS anomaly, which suggests the presence of\n518 G.

In con-\ntrast, the anomaly is discontinuous beneath the NVZ and EVZ,\nsuggesting that these linear zones may be fed laterally by a\ncentral upwelling. The WVZ is peripheral to the main, low-\nwave-speed body at most depths, in keeping with the view that\nit is a declining rift (Sigmundsson et al. 1994). A subsidiary,\n15 mGal Bouguer gravity low is associated with the Northwest\nFjords area, where we image local low VP and VS anomalies in\nthe upper y50 km.\nA number of factors affect seismic wave speeds. High\ntemperature reduces VP by y0.9 per cent per 100 K and VS by\n1.2\u20131.8 times this (Anderson 1989; Faul et al. 1994; Ito et al.\n1996; Goes et al. 2000). Numerical plume models for Iceland\npredict temperature anomalies of 70 to 250 K (e.g. Sleep 1990;\nFeighner & Kellogg 1995; Ribe et al. 1995; White et al. 1995),\nwhich correspond to anomalies in VP of 0.6\u20132.2 per cent and in\nVP \/VS of up to 2.1 per cent. The anomalies we observe are\nlocally up to about x2 per cent in VP and +3.7 per cent in VP \/\nVS, although the bulk of the low-wave-speed body has an\nanomaly in VP of 0.5\u20131.5 per cent and in VP\/VS of y1 per cent\n(Figs 13 and 15).\nThe wave-speed anomalies cannot be caused solely by\nelevated temperatures, since VS anomalies of up to 4.9 per\ncent would imply temperature anomalies of up to y300 K,\nthought to be an unrealistically high value.

Variation of VP\/VS with depth in the IASP91 model, i.e.\nthe starting values of VP\/VS (Kennett & Engdahl 1991).\n520 G. R. Foulger et al.\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nanomalies of only up to y2.5 per cent would be expected.\nPartial melt is a candidate explanation for the observations, as\nit depresses VS more strongly than VP (Anderson 1989; Karato\n1993). The effect of melt on seismic wave speeds is difficult to\nassess quantitatively, because it depends strongly on the geo-\nmetry of the melt bodies, with tabular shapes such as dykes,\nsills and thin films having about twice the effect of tubular\nshapes (Spetzler & Anderson 1968; Anderson & Sammis 1970;\nFaul et al. 1994). Melt may form at grain boundaries as both\nfilms and pockets (Faul et al. 1994). Under these circumstances,\na decrease of y3.4 per cent in VP and 7.8 per cent in VS for\neach 1 per cent increase in melt is a reasonable estimate (Goes\net al. 2000). In the upper y300 km of the central core of the\nbody, where the VP\/VS anomaly is strong, the observations are\nmost readily explained by temperature anomalies significantly\nlower than 200 K and a few tenths of a per cent partial melt.\nSuch an amount is insufficient for percolation to take place\n(Faul et al. 1994; Schmeling 2000). The outer parts of the body\ncan be explained by lower temperature anomalies and per cent\npartial melt. Regions where VP \/VS is highest and VP lowest are\nthe most likely sites for partial melt. These underlie the MVZ\nand northwest Vatnajokull in the depth range y100\u2013200 km,\nand the NVZ and EVZ in the depth range y200\u2013300 km.\nThe degree of partial melting suggested by our observations\nis smaller, and the depth range greater, than predicted for\nspreading plate boundaries and plumes. Melt fractions up to\ny20 per cent are predicted to occupy zones a few tens of kilo-\nmetres high in the upper y70 km beneath ridges and y120 km\nof plumes (Iwamori et al. 1995; Shen & Forsyth 1995; White &\nMcKenzie 1995; Ito et al. 1996; Schmeling 2000). Such zones\nare too small to be resolved by teleseismic tomography, which\nwill, at best, average them over a large volume. However, the\ndistribution of low-concentration partial melt beneath hotspots\nand ridges is not strongly constrained by physical plume models\n(McKenzie & Bickle 1988). Our observations are consistent\nwith Iceland being underlain by an extensive volume of low-\ndegree partial melt that extends at least throughout the sub-\nlithospheric low-velocity zone in the depth interval 190\u2013250 km\n(Gutenberg 1959; Anderson & Bass 1984; Anderson 1989).\nOther factors expected to affect seismic wave speeds in a\nvolcanic environment are chemical heterogeneity, including\nchemical depletion, and anisotropy. The possibility that com-\npositional variation might contribute to the observed anomalies\ncannot be ruled out. Depletion is the removal of basalt from\nthe parent rock. VP increases by y0.5 per cent per 10 per cent\ndepletion (Goes et al. 2000), and partial melting levels of up\nto y20 per cent are predicted locally beneath Iceland (White &\nMcKenzie 1995). However, the parent volume must be con-\ntinuously replenished by flow from deeper levels if erupted\nlavas are not to become progressively depleted with time, and if\nmelt production is not eventually to dwindle and cease, trends\nthat are not observed. The degree of depletion beneath Iceland\nis thus not certain, nor is its expected effect on seismic wave\nspeeds.\nAnisotropy is expected at mid-ocean ridges because flow\naligns olivine crystals so that the crystallographic a-axes [100]\nlie parallel to the flow direction. This causes VP and VS to be\nhigher for waves propagating parallel to the direction of flow\nthan normal to it. Such anisotropy might be as strong as +7 per\ncent (e.g. Anderson 1989; Kendall 1994). A simplistic model for\na plume beneath Iceland would predict vertical upward flow\nwithin a central core and radially outward flow in the upper\n50\u2013100 km. Superimposed on the shallow, radial flow pattern\nmight be bilaterally symmetric flow away from the spreading\nplate boundary. Such a pattern of flow might increase vertical\nwave speeds in the plume core, where rays are subvertical. Thus\nthe negative wave-speed anomalies we observe there, of up to\nx2.1 per cent in VP and x4.9 per cent in VS, if corrected for\nanisotropy, might be as strong as x9 and x12 per cent. In the\ntopmost y100 km, dykes and flow-induced anisotropy might\nstrengthen the negative anomalies observed, since horizontal\nflow aligns the slow b-axis vertically. However, the few obser-\nvations of upper mantle anisotropy currently available for\nIceland fail to support the simple flow model described above\n(Bjarnason et al. 1996), so this effect cannot yet be assessed\nquantitatively.\nStructure beneath the Reykjanes ridge and the Tjornes\nFracture Zone\nWe observe a negative VP anomaly of up to yx0.5 per cent\nat all depths beneath the Reykjanes ridge close to Iceland.\nResolution in VS is superior in this part of the model, and\nshows an anomaly of up to yx2.5 per cent in the depth range\ny50\u2013200 km. In this region, the VP\/VS anomaly is up to\n+2.4 per cent, which is consistent with the presence of up to a\nfew tenths of a per cent of partial melt. The Reykjanes ridge is\nperipheral to our study volume and is poorly imaged. However,\nthe structure imaged beneath it contrasts with that observed\nbeneath other seaward parts of our study volume, for example,\nto the west and east of Iceland (Figs 13 and 14, section DDk).\nThis structure is also expected on geological grounds, and is\nthus probably real.\nThe structure found beneath the TFZ to the north is well\nresolved and contrasts sharply with that beneath the Reykjanes\nridge. Both VP and VS are normal or high in the upper\n100\u2013200 km. At greater depths, the low-wave-speed body imaged\nbeneath central Iceland extends to the north of the TFZ. The\npositive VP \/VS anomaly is, however, no stronger than y+1 per\ncent anywhere beneath this region, and thus partial melting is\nnot required to explain the observations.\nThe structures we observe beneath the Reykjanes ridge and\nthe TFZ agree with predictions that melt may be channelled\nbeneath ridges and blocked by fracture zones (e.g. Vogt 1976;\nSchilling et al. 1985; Schilling 1991; Ribe et al. 1995; Sleep\n1996, 1997). Material is thought to flow unimpeded from\nbeneath central Iceland southwestwards along the Reykjanes\nridge at shallow depth, and to cause the topographic uplift and\nenhanced on-ridge volcanism observed there. The structure\nwe observe beneath the TFZ supports the prediction that this\nfracture zone blocks the lateral flow of melt. This close agree-\nment with geological ground truth in peripheral parts of our\nstudy volume strengthens confidence in our results in general.\nNature of the anomaly beneath Iceland\nThe most significant feature of the anomaly is its change\nin shape from cylindrical to tabular at about 250 km depth\nbeneath Iceland. Several geodynamic models predict such a\nchange in morphology, including buoyant upwelling, passive\ninfilling of a widening rift, convection resulting from lateral\ntemperature gradients, heating from below or cooling from\nabove. All these models imply that the anomaly is caused by\na buoyant upwelling whose origin is approached at the depth\nUpwelling beneath Iceland confined to upper mantle 521\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nat which it becomes tabular. Thus, although our experiment\ndoes not resolve structure below the base of the anomaly, the\nchange in morphology we observe suggests that the anomaly\nis confined to the upper mantle. We cannot rule out by direct\nobservation the possibility that it continues below this, but some\nunknown mechanism would be required to cause a cylindrical\nplume rising from deep within the lower mantle to become\ntabular as it rises. The possibility that the tabular structure is\nan artefact of poor resolution and that the true structure\nis axisymmetric is shown to be very unlikely by the several\nresolution tests we performed (see e.g. Figs 10 and 12).\nNumerical models of convection in a constant-viscosity\nlayer heated both from below and internally display changes\nin thermal structure resembling the structure we observe\n(Houseman 1990). Both uprising hot bodies and downgoing\ncold bodies are predicted to start out with tabular morphology\nand then to become cylindrical. Flow at the surface retains\nmemory of the deep upwellings, so that surface rift zone\norientations reflect the trends of the deep tabular zones near the\nbase of the convecting layer. Although convection modelling\nresults are not unique, they do predict a morphological change\nsuch as that we observe, in addition to the fact that the tabular\npart of the anomaly below 250 km underlies the spreading\nplate boundary and has the same orientation.\nPulling apart lithospheric plates induces transient upwelling\non a vertical scale similar to lithospheric thickness (Anderson\n1998a), which in the case of the Greenland and Scandinavian\ncratons is y200\u2013300 km. The deep upwelling is predicted to\nhave a linear form parallel to the plate margins at depth, but to\nassume a more cylindrical shape at shallower levels (Korenaga\n2000). Lateral temperature gradients at the edges of cold cratons\ncan also drive convection (e.g. King & Anderson 1995, 1998;\nAnderson 1998a). Sinking cold mantle material at the margins\nof Greenland and Scandinavia might by this mechanism induce\ncompensating upwelling of hot material centred between the\ncratons, and could account for volcanism in the Iceland region.\n3-D models of this process indicate that a north\u2013south tabular\nupwelling is expected at depth, which becomes concentrated\nupwards into cylindrical bodies (Korenaga 2000).\nMorphological changes like the one we observe are common\nin other geological phenomena, e.g. salt domes, diapirs and\nback-arc volcanism. Similar structures also occur in laboratory\nexperiments on diapiric phenomena in materials such as oils and\nputty, and in gravity-driven and centrifuged models (Ramberg\n1981). Our model is probably the first observation of such\nmorphology on the scale of the upper mantle.\nAll the above-mentioned models predict that the Iceland\nhotspot has remained essentially centred in the middle of the\nnorth Atlantic for its whole history. Such a conclusion would\nsupport ridge-stationary models (e.g. Bott 1985) but not models\nof an eastward-migrating hotspot (e.g. Vink 1984), which are\nbased on the assumption that the Iceland hotspot has remained\nfixed relative to other Atlantic hotspots.\nComparison with whole-mantle and regional\nfull-thickness mantle tomography models\nOur inference that upwelling beneath Iceland is primarily an\nupper mantle phenomenon is consistent with recent whole-\nmantle and regional full-thickness mantle tomography models,\nwhich provide no evidence for structure in the lower mantle\ncomparable to that in the upper mantle. Following the\npioneering studies of Hager & Clayton (1989) and Zhou\n(1996), studies by Bijwaard & Spakman (1999), Ritsema et al.\n(1999), Megnin & Romanowicz (2000) and Karason & van der\nHilst (2001a,b) all confirm that a strong, negative wave-speed\nanomaly 1000 km or more wide occupies the upper mantle\nbeneath the Iceland region. Because of the resolution limitations\nin these studies, the results are consistent with the narrower but\nstronger anomaly we observe, and all the results are con-\nsistent with a narrow anomaly embedded in a broader, weaker\nanomaly extending beyond our study volume. All these studies\nimage a strong anomaly that is confined to the upper mantle.\nAnomalies in the lower mantle are weak, with strengths of\nat most a fraction of a per cent, have complicated shapes\nand are mostly discontinuous with the upper mantle anomaly\nimmediately beneath Iceland. Resolution may not be equally\ngood at all depths, however, and it is important to explore, for\neach study, the minimum size and strength of anomaly in the\nlower mantle that can be ruled out.\nRitsema et al. (1999) inverted more than two million data\nfrom digital global and regional networks, including shear wave\narrival times (S, SS, SSS, ScS and SKS), fundamental- and\nhigher-mode Rayleigh wave phase velocities and normal-mode\nfrequencies. This is the first whole-mantle tomography model\nthat makes use of higher-mode phase velocity measurements.\nThe inclusion of higher-mode surface waves results in this\nmodel probably having the best resolution of any spherical\nharmonic model to date in the transition zone and mid-\nmantle. Resolution beneath Iceland and the north Atlantic is\nfurther improved by the use of SS and SSS traveltimes from\nstations in North America and Europe, for which the bounce\npoints underlie Iceland and the north Atlantic (J. Ritsema,\npersonal communication, 2001). In this model, lower mantle\nVS anomalies beneath Iceland are clearly much weaker and\nless coherent than the upper mantle anomaly, and there is no\nevidence that the latter continues down into the lower mantle\n(Fig. 17).\nMegnin & Romanowicz (2000) inverted time-domain wave-\nforms of SH body waves and first- and second-orbit fundamental-\nand higher-mode Love waves, which have sensitivity throughout\nthe mantle. Their method uses more accurate kernels for\nbody waves in the lower mantle than traveltime methods that\nassume infinite-frequency or waveform methods that use path-\naveraging approximations (Megnin & Romanowicz 1998). Their\nVS model resembles that of Ritsema et al. (1999) in having\nweak lower mantle anomalies beneath Iceland (Fig. 18). In the\nupper few hundred kilometres of the lower mantle, their model\nhas a positive VS anomaly.\nBijwaard & Spakman (1999) inverted a large set of repro-\ncessed seismological bulletin P-wave arrival times (Engdahl\net al. 1998). Their 3-D model has a continuous, negative VP\nanomaly in the lower mantle with a strength of up to x0.5 per\ncent, extending from a few hundred kilometres above the core\u2013\nmantle boundary beneath the Iceland\u2013Greenland ridge to the\nbase of the upper mantle transition zone beneath the Iceland\u2013\nFaeroe ridge (Fig. 19a). The width of the anomaly varies from\nless than 300 to about 900 km, and it is inclined by about 30u\nfrom the vertical. Bijwaard & Spakman (1999) suggested that\nthis anomaly represents a plume extending from the core\u2013\nmantle boundary to the surface, and present a cross-section\nshowing a continuous low-wave-speed structure throughout the\nupper and lower mantles (Fig. 19a). However, the impression\nof a continuous, homogenous structure is achieved by saturating\n522 G. R. Foulger et al.\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nthe colour scale at 0.5 per cent, concealing the fact that the\nanomaly is an order of magnitude stronger in the upper mantle\nthan in the lower mantle. Furthermore, the limited longitudinal\nextent of the cross-section presented conceals the fact that\nsimilar, vertically continuous, even more plume-like, low-\nwave-speed structures are also imaged beneath the adjacent\nCanadian and Scandinavian cratons, where there is no geo-\nlogical evidence for hotspots. These facts, combined with\nthe poor repeatability of this structure between independent\nmodels, makes it unlikely that the structure imaged represents a\ncontinuous plume traversing the whole mantle beneath Iceland.\nFurthermore, inversions heavily reliant on reprocessed seismo-\nlogical bulletin P-wave arrival times have very little resolving\npower in the lower mantle beneath Iceland (Karason & van der\nHilst 2001a,b).\nThis last point is well illustrated in a study by Karason &\nvan der Hilst (2001a,b) who used yseven million reprocessed\nP-, pP- and PKP-phase arrival times from the catalogue of\nEngdahl et al. (1998) measured at y4000 stations worldwide,\nfrom y300 000 earthquakes, along with several thousand\ndifferential traveltimes of Pdiff, PKP and PP waves determined\nby waveform cross-correlation.

Beneath Iceland, a\nlow-wave-speed anomaly of up to 2 per cent is detected that\nextends from the surface down to the base of the upper mantle\nand no deeper (Fig. 19b, cross-section at lower left). In order to\nstudy the variation in resolution in the mantle beneath Iceland,\nand specifically to investigate if a deeper structure could be\ndetected if it existed, rays were traced through a theoretical\nplume-like structure (Fig. 19b, cross-section at lower middle)\nto generate synthetic data. The theoretical structure extends\nfrom the surface to 1500 km depth, and has a wave-speed\nanomaly of 2 per cent in the upper mantle and 1 per cent in\nthe lower mantle. The synthetic data were inverted to test\nfor anomaly retrieval (Fig. 19b, cross-section at lower right).\nRetrieval of the anomaly is good above y400 km, partial in\nthe transition zone, but poor in the lower mantle. Inversion\nparameters can perhaps be found that would recover better this\nparticular theoretical structure, but this example (H. Karason\n& R. D. van der Hilst, personal communication, 2001) illustrates\nthat, with this data set, and that of Bijwaard & Spakman\n(1999) because of the paucity of rays sampling the lower mantle\nbeneath Iceland, resolution there is very poor. This analysis\nillustrates the non-uniformity of data coverage, and thus\nresolution, in mantle tomography images, and the importance\nof assessing resolution prior to interpreting the results.\nPresently available tomography models using spherical\nharmonic basis functions cannot resolve the sizes of bodies\nsmaller than y1000 km in diameter. Smaller bodies can be\ndetected if they are strong, but they become smeared over\nbroad regions. For example, low-wave-speed bodies underlying\nthe mid-Atlantic ridge are imaged, but smeared over distances\nof y1000 km, although regional and local-scale studies show\nthem to be much narrower. Models that use local rather than\nspherical harmonic basis functions can resolve the sizes of\nsmaller bodies. In addition, low-wave-speed bodies are more\ndifficult to detect using tomography than high-wave-speed\nbodies because rays passing through a low-wave-speed body\nmay not arrive first at stations. Beneath Iceland, ray coverage\nin the lower mantle is sparse for direct P waves, compared with\nthe upper mantle, and the use of additional phases and higher-\nmode surface waves is necessary to achieve good resolution in\nthe transition zone and uppermost lower mantle. Mindful of\nthese caveats, it remains the case that none of the presently\navailable tomographic models of the whole mantle shows\nevidence of continuation into the lower mantle of the structure\nimaged in the upper mantle beneath Iceland.\n Depth 410 km\nI II\n   0\n 410\n 660\n2000\n I II  I II\n0   \n410 \n660 \n2000\n I II\n(\u22121.0%) slow fast (+1.0%)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 19.

Foulger et al.\n# 2001 RAS, GJI 146, 504\u2013530\nThe dependence of seismic wave speeds on temperature\nis weaker in the lower than in the upper mantle, so that a given\ntemperature anomaly would be characterized by a weaker\nseismic anomaly in the lower mantle than in the upper mantle.\nHowever, the effect of temperature on seismic wave speeds\nis closely related to thermal expansion through the second\nGruneisen parameter, both being caused by anharmonicity of\nlattice vibrations (e.g. Anderson 1989, Chapter 5), so material\nwith a weak seismic anomaly in the lower mantle would have\nweak buoyancy. This fact suggests that material in the upper\nand lower mantles with greatly contrasting seismic anomalies\nwould not form a single, coherent, convecting structure.\nComparison with previous teleseismic tomography\nresults\nTryggvason et al. (1983) conducted the first teleseismic tomo-\ngraphy study of the upper mantle beneath Iceland. They used\ndata from a highly non-uniform 39-station network of 4 Hz\ngeophones with pen-and-ink recording (Fig. 20). These data\nare of poor quality, because the geophones used are insensitive\nto teleseismic P waves, whose dominant frequencies are in the\nband y0.5\u20132.0 Hz. A set of 714 P-phase arrival times from\n61 earthquakes was inverted to determine the VP structure\nof the upper 375 km (Table 2). The resulting model has two\ndisconnected bodies about 200 km in diameter with VP up to\nyx3 per cent low (Fig. 21). This study did not deal with the\neffects of lateral variation in crustal structure, and explained\nonly 33 per cent of the arrival time residual variance, which\nsuggests that the data set contains little coherent signal. There\nis little resemblance between the results of Tryggvason et al.\n(1983) and those of later work.\nWolfe et al. (1997) conducted a study using data from a\n16-station network of digital broad-band stations, uniformly\ndistributed at intervals of y100 km over a 450 kmr260 km\narea covering much of Iceland (Fig. 22). They inverted 601\nP-wave (mostly P-phase) times from 86 earthquakes and 560\nS-wave (mostly S-phase) times from 78 earthquakes for structure\nin the upper 400 km, using station terms to model the crust.\nThey achieved arrival time residual variance reductions of\n90 per cent for P and 83 per cent for S (Table 2). They used a\nfine-scale (25 km) parametrization of the structure and applied\nsmoothing constraints using a minimum-variation method to\nstabilize the inversion. The first-order structure they found\nis a negative wave-speed anomaly with a maximum strength\nof about x2 per cent for VP and x4 per cent for VS. In the\nshallowest parts of the model (125 km), this anomaly underlies\nthe surface rift zones, and it broadens with depth to a width of\ny400 km at 400 km depth.\nCompared with the experiment of Wolfe et al. (1997), our\nnetwork contained about three times as many stations and had\na larger aperture, including instruments in the far north and\neast of Iceland, on the island of Grimsey in the TFZ and on the\ntip of the Snaefellsnes peninsula. Our P-wave data set is more\nthan five times as large and our S-wave data set over twice\nas large. In addition, we used many surface-reflected (PP, SS)\narrivals, which improved ray coverage in azimuth\u2013slowness\nspace and model resolution. Wolfe et al. (1997) used an iterative\nmethod to deal with non-linearity effects of the refraction\nof rays, and smoothed their model by applying regularization\nconstraints that minimize spatial gradients and roughness and\nminimize shallow or abrupt anomalies. Their model is thus\nhighly smoothed, as it must be for such a sparse network.\nTable 2. Details of teleseismic tomography studies of the upper mantle beneath Iceland.\nTryggvason et al.

(1997) is a negative wave-speed anomaly, with a diameter\nof about 200 km and strengths of up to 2\u20133 and 4\u20135 per cent\nin VP and VS, extending continuously to a depth of at least\n400 km. The anomalies imaged by Wolfe et al. (1997) differ\nfrom ours in widening with depth in all directions. Keller et al.\n(2000) pointed out that the shape of the anomaly of Wolfe et al.\n(1997) closely resembles that of the incoming ray bundle, and\nquestioned the resolution of the model at depths greater than\nabout 200 km. They argued that the experiment cannot resolve\nstructure deeper than y200 km, and that structure imaged\nbelow this depth could simply result from the downward\nsmearing of shallow anomalies. The anomaly in our model also\nwidens with depth in the north\u2013south direction, but narrows in\nthe east\u2013west direction. By virtue of our wider array aperture,\ndenser station distribution and larger and more diverse data\nset, our resolution is superior at all depths. The criticisms\nof Keller et al. (2000) are thus probably valid, and the east\u2013\nwest widening of the anomaly of Wolfe et al. (1997) is artificial.\nClearly, the problem of resolution is of critical importance to\nusing teleseismic tomography to seek plume-like structures\nbecause this type of experiment is prone to systematic dis-\ntortions that can produce artificial anomalies of precisely the\nkind being sought.\nAlthough Wolfe et al. (1997) did not point it out, except for\nVP around 125 km, the anomaly in their model is centred on\nthe eastern MVZ as it is in our model. Some tendency is also\ndiscernible for their anomaly, especially for VP, to be elongated\nin the NNW direction at depths of about 300 km, in agreement\nwith the systematic morphological change that we find. Wolfe\net al. (1997) also found a positive VP\/VS anomaly of up to\ny+2 per cent, which agrees with our result. The sparseness\nof the network used by Wolfe et al. (1997) resulted in a lack of\ncrossing rays in the upper y100 km and a lack of resolution\nbeneath the near-shore Reykjanes ridge.

The thickness of the transition zone (that is,\nthe separation of the 400 and 650 km discontinuities) is smaller\nbeneath south Iceland than the global average. This is con-\nsistent with elevated temperatures, and Shen et al. (1998, 2001)\ninterpreted it as evidence for a plume rising from the lower\nmantle. However, similar thickness variations have been detected\nelsewhere and there is no global correlation between these\nvariations and hotspots (e.g. Chevrot et al. 1999), although this\nmight be explained by a lack of resolution in the global studies.\nUltra-low-wave-speed anomalies have been detected in a dome-\nshaped volume 250 km wide and 40 km high in region Da just\nabove the core\u2013mantle boundary southwest of Iceland and\ninterpreted as a partial melt body that could be the source\nof a lower mantle plume beneath Iceland (Helmberger et al.\n1998). However, this anomaly may have nothing to do with the\nIceland volcanic province, because region Da is exceptionally\nheterogeneous everywhere and evidence for structural con-\nnection with the surface is absent. Observations of seismic\nanomalies for waves passing beneath the Iceland region and\narriving at the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) are con-\nsistent with a weak negative VP anomaly beneath the Iceland\u2013\nFaeroes ridge, similar to that found by Bijwaard & Spakman\n(1999), but this interpretation is highly non-unique (Pritchard\net al. 2000). The NORSAR data do not support an extension\ninto the mid-lower mantle of the broader plume hypothesized\nby Shen et al. (1998, 2001) to underlie Iceland.\nMuch of the seismic evidence for a plume in the lower mantle\nbeneath Iceland consists of observations of types that either\nare found elsewhere unaccompanied by hotspots or are not\nfound beneath known hotspots. Many studies specifically seek\na narrow, vertical, cylindrical body with a relatively strong\nanomaly, and the results tend to be interpreted in these terms if\npossible, although the observations may be consistent with\nother hypotheses.\nNon-seismic data interpreted in support of plumes in the\nlower mantle include the broad geoid highs associated with hot-\nspots, which indicate major low-density anomalies in the lower\nmantle (Richards & Hager 1988). Global surface heat flow\nrequires the extraction of heat from the lower mantle and core\n(Davies 1988; Sleep 1990). Trace element and isotopic anomalies\nhave been attributed variously to lower mantle plumes, the upper\nmantle or upper mantle sources with entrained lower mantle\nmaterial (e.g. Fitton et al. 1997). In particular, high 3He\/4He\nisotope ratios in some hotspot rocks (e.g. Hilton et al. 1999) are\ncommonly attributed to excess 3He from a primordial, little-\ndegassed lower mantle (e.g. O\u2019Nions & Tolstikhin 1994). This\ntheory has recently been brought into question, however, and\ninstead these observations may reflect an upper mantle source\ndepleted in 4He (e.g. Anderson 1998c,b; Graham et al. 1998;\nFoulger & Pearson 2001).\nThe deep structure beneath hotspots varies greatly. The\nEast African rift is underlain by a strong negative VP anomaly\nthat plunges to the southwest, is y2000 km wide and extends\nthroughout the whole mantle to the core\u2013mantle boundary\n(Woodhouse & Dziewonski 1984; Ritsema et al. 1999). This\ncontrasts radically with the Iceland hotspot, where the strong\nseismic anomaly is confined to the upper mantle. Where clear,\nlow-wave-speed, lower mantle bodies are detected by full-\nthickness mantle tomography beneath surface hotspots, they\nare far from having classical plume morphology. The simplistic\nmodel of tall, narrow, relatively simple, vertical, cylindrical\npipe-like structures delivering hot material from deep within\nthe lower mantle, or even transporting material within the upper\nmantle to the surface, is gaining little observational support,\nwhile that of shallow-seated phenomena is becoming increasingly\nviable.\nA C K N O W L E D G M E N T S\nWe are indebted to Jeroen Ritsema, Barbara Romanowicz,\nCharles Megnin, Rob van der Hilst and Hrafnkell Karason,\nwho generously provided cross-sections through their mantle\ntomography models in the Iceland region (Figs 17, 18 and 19).\nThis research was funded by Natural Environment Research\nCouncil (NERC) grants GST\/02\/1238 and GR3\/10727, and\nNSF grant EAR 9417918.
