INTRODUCTION\nNitride-based semiconductor structures have been of con-\nsiderable interest in recent years.1,2 Whereas GaAs and most\nother III\u2013V compounds have a cubic \u0001zinc-blende\u0002 crystal\nstructure, GaN and related nitride alloys generally have a\nhexagonal \u0001wurtzite\u0002 structure, which leads to strong built-in\nfields in quantum wells and heterostructures, of the order of\nMV\/cm. As a consequence, conduction band electrons and\nvalence band holes become spatially separated in GaN-based\nquantum well structures, with the electron-hole overlap de-\ncreasing rapidly for quantum well widths greater than about\n50 \u00c5. As well as strong interest in the influence of composi-\ntion and well-width fluctuations on the electronic structure of\nInGaN\/GaN quantum well structures, there is increasing in-\nterest in nitride-based quantum dot \u0001QD\u0002 structures.3\u20135\nA key requirement therefore is for a relatively simple\ntechnique to determine the variation in the built-in potential\nin nitride-based QD structures. There are two contributions\nto the built-in potential in these systems; the first, referred to\nas the spontaneous potential, arises due to the difference be-\ntween the QD and matrix materials; the second, referred to as\nthe strain-induced or piezoelectric potential, arises due to\nstrain-induced lattice distortions.\nWe previously presented a Fourier transform method for\ndetermining the built-in potential in wurtzite crystals.6 The\nmethod is based on a plane-wave expansion method in\nwhich, first, the Fourier transform of the quantum dot char-\nacteristic function is calculated explicitly, second, an analyti-\ncal expression for the built-in potential due to a plane-wave\nvariation in composition is derived, and finally, the built-in\npotential due to the QD is calculated. The Fourier transform\nmethod has demonstrated very clearly that the piezoelectric\neffect can introduce a strong additional lateral confining po-\ntential into a quantum dot, localizing both electrons and\nholes along the central axis of the dot. However, although\nthis Fourier transform method provides a useful technique\nfor calculating the three-dimensional \u00013D\u0002 built-in potential,\nit suffers from a number of drawbacks. It does not provide a\nready intuitive understanding of how the potential depends\non such factors as the dot base-to-height ratio and the relative\ninfluence of different contributions to the overall built-in po-\ntential. Solutions for an isolated QD, rather than a uniform\n3D array, requires a unit cell size large enough for the influ-\nence of the surrounding dots to be negligible, which in-\ncreases the number of Fourier terms required and hence the\ncomputation time. Finally, adaptation of the Fourier trans-\nform method to dots of unusual shape or variable composi-\ntion is not easy.\nThe only alternative method for determining the built-in\npotential in wurtzite crystals is due to Pan,7 who determined\nthe Green\u2019s functions enabling the piezoelectric potential to\nbe computed for an anisotropic and piezoelectric half-space\nfor a range of surface boundary conditions and accounting\nfor the electromechanical coupling of the piezoelectric po-\ntential \u0001but not the spontaneous potential\u0002 to the strain. The\ntheory is general, rather complex, and therefore suffers from\nas many drawbacks as the Fourier transform method. Par-\nticularly, it does not provide analytic expressions or simple\nmethods of calculation for the group III-nitride \u0001III-N\u0002 sys-\ntem.\nIt is clearly useful to have a simple real-space technique\nto determine the built-in potential for the nitride-based semi-\nconductors. Previous authors have presented volume and sur-\nface integral expressions for the potential due to the sponta-\nneous polarization of the dot and matrix materials. We\nextend that work here to present a technique to derive similar\nvolume and surface integral expressions for the strain-\ninduced piezoelectric potential. A number of simplifying as-\nsumptions are made in order to make the problem analyti-\ncally tractable, including isotropic elastic constants and equal\nelastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric constants in the QD and\nmatrix. We discuss these assumptions in more detail below\nand how any errors that they introduce should be less than or\nequal to the error caused by the current uncertainty in the\nknown values of material parameters for nitrides.8\nThe derived surface integral formulas are especially use-\nful for QDs with vertical sides such as cuboidal or cylindrical\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 235318 \u00012005\u0002\n1098-0121\/2005\/72\u000123\u0002\/235318\u000110\u0002\/$23.00 \u00a92005 The American Physical Society235318-1\ndots. Analytical solutions are derived for the built-in poten-\ntial along and close to the central axis of spherical, cylindri-\ncal, cuboidal, truncated-cone, and ellipsoidal dots. The effect\nof varying the dot shape is investigated, with particular em-\nphasis on the truncated hexagonal pyramid shape, thought to\nbe the actual shape of Stranski-Krastanow grown nitride\nQDs.9 The relative contribution of the spontaneous and\nstrain-induced potentials to the total potential is also exam-\nined. We show that the potential distribution in a hexagonal\nquantum dot is very close to that of an equivalent dot with\ncircular symmetry, which can considerably simplify the cal-\nculation of energy states in such dots. Overall, the results\npresented here provide a very useful framework to analyze\nthe built-in potential in nitride-based QDs, providing a\nsimple starting point for more detailed calculations of elec-\ntron and hole states in such structures.\nII. THEORY\nThe built-in polarization due to quantum dots in wurtzite\ncrystals arises from two sources; that induced by the strain\nfield and that due to the difference in spontaneous polariza-\ntion between the dot and matrix materials. The piezoelectric\npolarization induced by a strain field \u0001kl is given by\nPi = eijk\u0001 jk, \u00011\u0002\nwhere eijk is the tensor of piezoelectric constants. Symmetry\nconsiderations allow these 27 constants to be reduced to just\nthree independent components for the wurtzite nitrides\n\u0001GaN, AlN, InN\u0002, which for convenience are renamed: e15\n\u0003e113=e223, e31\u0003e311=e322, and e33\u0003e333, so that the strain-\ninduced polarization is given by\nPstr = \u0004 2e15\u0001132e15\u000123\ne31\u0001\u000111 + \u000122\u0002 + e33\u000133\n\u0005 . \u00012\u0002\nThe spontaneous polarization arises because the dimensions\nand atom sites of a III-N unit cell differ slightly from those\nof an ideal hexagonal crystal. This small deviation introduces\nspontaneous polarization along the c axis \u0001x3 direction\u0002,\nPspo= Pspon\u02c63. The total polarization P is therefore equal to\nPstr+Pspo.\nIn the theory that follows, a number of simplifying as-\nsumptions are made.\n\u00011\u0002 It is assumed that the elastic constants of the dot and\nmatrix material are equal. We have argued before that this is\na reasonable approximation10 which can be overcome using\niterative techniques.6\n\u00012\u0002 We have calculated previously the strain due to arrays\nof dots in crystals of hexagonal symmetry11,12 but, in order to\nderive the integral expressions here, the dot and matrix are\nassumed to have isotropic elastic constants and equal c \/a\nratios. This should be a reasonable approximation for\nInN\/GaN, where the fractional lattice mismatch along the\ngrowth direction \u0001c axis\u0002 is similar to that in the lateral di-\nrection \u0001a plane; x1-x2 plane\u0002. It will be a poorer approxima-\ntion for GaN\/AlN, where the lattice mismatch in the lateral\nand growth directions are different. However, the spontane-\nous polarization makes the greater contribution to the total\npotential in GaN\/AlN heterostructures, so that any error in-\ntroduced through the isotropic approximation will be of less\noverall consequence in this case.\n\u00013\u0002 It is assumed that the piezoelectric constants are inde-\npendent of material. This is a good approximation for e31,\nand is also reasonable for e15 in the case of GaN\/AlN and\nInN\/GaN heterostructures \u0001see Table I\u0002. However, it is not so\ngood for e33, particularly in the case of GaN\/AlN. We use\nthe piezoelectric constants of the dot material in the calcula-\ntions below. This minimizes any error in the calculated dot\npotential due to the difference in e33 between the dot and\nmatrix materials.6,10\n\u00014\u0002 The dielectric constant \u0001relative permittivity\u0002 is as-\nsumed to be isotropic and independent of material. The ar-\ngument in favor of this approximation is similar to that for\nthe elastic constants, and can also be corrected using the\nsame iterative techniques.6,10 Here, we take the isotropic di-\nelectric constant to be \u0002r=\n1\n3 \u00012\u0002xx+\u0002zz\u0002, using the ab initio\nvalues from Ref. 13 for GaN and AlN, giving values of 9.6\nfor GaN and 8.5 for AlN. The difference between the two is\nthus less than 12%, in agreement with other studies,14,15 im-\nplying that the approximation is reasonable for GaN\/AlN\nQDs. In the case of InN, the published values vary greatly,\nfrom 6.7 \u0001Ref. 16\u0002 to 15.3 \u0001Ref. 14\u0002, and this uncertainty is\ncompounded by the recent uncertainty in the band gap of\nInN. We take the most commonly used experimental value,\n15, from Ref. 17. The large difference between this value and\nthat of the other nitrides suggests that the approximation\nmust be used with caution for InN\/GaN QDs. However, it\nshould still be valid for studies of InxGa1\u2212xN\/GaN QDs with\nmoderate values of x, since in this case the dielectric constant\nof the InxGa1\u2212xN alloy will be much closer to that of GaN.\nTABLE I.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 72, 235318 \u00012005\u0002\n235318-2\n\u00015\u0002 It is assumed that the dot is buried within an infinite\nmatrix, thus surface effects are neglected for the matrix. The\npolarization potential decays over a distance of several dot\ndimensions,10 so this is a good approximation provided the\ndot is not very close to a surface or interface.\n\u00016\u0002 It is assumed that the materials are electromechani-\ncally uncoupled, that is, the standard isotropic elastic strain\nsolution is used to evaluate the piezoelectric field assuming\nthat the piezoelectric field itself produces a negligible modi-\nfication of the elastic field. The magnitude of the electrome-\nchanical coupling can be estimated by evaluating g\n=emax \/\u0006\u0002maxCmax where emax, \u0002max, and Cmax are the maxi-\nmum values of the piezoelectric constant, dielectric constant,\nand elastic constant, respectively.18 A value of g in excess of\n0.5 indicates strong coupling, a value of 0.1 or less indicates\nnegligible coupling.7 InN, GaN, and AlN take values ranging\nfrom 0.12 to 0.25, suggesting that electromechanical cou-\npling is small and can safely be neglected. This has been\nconfirmed for InGaN\/GaN quantum wells by Christmas et\nal.,8 where the exact solution for the fully coupled problem is\npresented and it is shown that the effects of electromagnetic\ncoupling are small. An alternative argument has been pro-\nvided by Andreev and O\u2019Reilly,19 where it is shown that the\ncorrections due to electromechanical coupling may be taken\ninto account by renormalizing \u0001or correcting\u0002 the material\nconstants and these corrections of the constants are smaller\nthan the uncertainty in their values.\nA. Strain-induced piezoelectric potential\nWe derive here expressions in the form of surface and\nvolume integrals for the electrostatic potential arising from\nthe strain-induced polarization in wurtzite crystals.

Finally \u00010 is the isotropic\nmisfit strain, assumed equal to 13 \u00012\u00010a+\u00010c\u0002, where \u00010a is the\nmisfit strain in the a plane, and \u00010c is the misfit strain along\nthe c axis.\nThe strain components can be written as integrals over the\nsurface of the dot20,22\n\u0001ij\u0001r\u0002 = \u0005ij\u00010\u0004QD +\n\u00010A\n4\u0006 \tQD\n\u0001xi \u2212 xi\u0001\u0002\n\nr \u2212 r\u0001\n3\nn\u02c6 j \u00b7 dS\u0001, \u00014\u0002\nwhere the primed quantities refer to points on the surface of\nthe dot, \u0001x1 ,x2 ,x3\u0002\u0003\u0001x ,y ,z\u0002, n\u02c6 j is the unit vector in the j\ndirection, and A= \u00011+\u0003\u0002 \/ \u00011\u2212\u0003\u0002. We can now determine the\nelectrostatic potential using the Maxwell equation \u0001 \u00b7D=0,\nwhere\nD = \u0002r\u00020E + P \u00015\u0002\ntogether with the corresponding continuity condition that\nn\u02c6 \u00b7D must be continuous on crossing the boundary of the dot.\nHere n\u02c6 is a unit vector normal to the surface of the dot, D is\nthe electric displacement, \u0002r is the relative permittivity, and\nthe electric field, E, is equal to \u2212\u0001\u0007, where \u0007 is the electro-\nstatic potential we wish to determine. Thus Eq. \u00015\u0002 becomes\n\u0001 \u00b7 Pstr = \u0002r\u00020\u00012\u0007str. \u00016\u0002\nWhen we substitute Eq. \u00014\u0002 into Eq. \u00013\u0002 for Pstr, we can then\nobtain \u0001 \u00b7Pstr and hence \u00012\u0007str as the differential of a set of\nsurface integrals. The strain components \u0001ij given by Eq. \u00014\u0002\ncan be discontinuous on crossing the boundary between the\ndot and matrix material. We require, however, that n\u02c6 \u00b7D and\nhence the potential \u0007str is continuous across the boundary.\nWe use this continuity requirement below to determine \u0007str\nfor the given strain distribution. In the following derivation,\nwe initially ignore the points on the surface of the dot which\ngive rise to singularities in the integrals of Eq. \u00014\u0002, and hence\ncan take differentials inside or move them outside the inte-\ngral equations.

Spontaneous potential\nThe wurtzite crystal structure is hexagonal and, even in an\nunstrained state, the III-nitride crystal structure deviates\nslightly from a perfect hexagonal arrangement, resulting in a\npermanent or spontaneous polarization with the polarization\nvector pointing along the c axis \u0001x3 axis\u0002.\nThe potential due to the spontaneous polarization can be\nderived by using the standard result from electromagnetism\nfor the potential distribution due to a constant polarization\nfield, to obtain,23\n\u0007spo\u0001r\u0002 =\n1\n4\u0006\u0002r\u00020\n\u000f\t\nQD\nPQD \u00b7 dS\u0001\n\nr \u2212 r\u0001\n\n+ \t\nM\nPM \u00b7 dSM\n\nr \u2212 rM\n\n\u0010 ,\n\u000113\u0002\nwhere PQD and PM are the constant spontaneous polariza-\ntions due to the dot and matrix, respectively.

Special solutions\nResults may be generated by evaluating explicitly the in-\ntegrals derived in the previous sections. For example, the\nelectric field due to the spontaneous potential may be evalu-\nated from Espo=\u2212\u0001\u0007spo using Eq. \u000114\u0002.

These solutions are particu-\nlarly useful, since the electron and hole wave functions are\ngenerally centered on this high-symmetry axis.6 The inte-\ngrals I1 and I2 can be solved analytically along the central x3\naxis for any regular n-gon-shaped surface, oriented in the\nx1-x2 plane \u0001see Appendix B\u0002. This immediately provides the\npotential along the central axis for any dot with a regular\ncross section and vertical sides.

ANALYSIS OF GaN\/AlN AND InN\/GaN\nQUANTUM DOTS\nWe now use this surface integral method to investigate the\nbuilt-in potential in GaN\/AlN and InN\/GaN quantum dots.\nThe material parameters used are taken from Vurgaftman and\nMeyer24 \u0001see Table I\u0002. We use the dot material values for \u0002r\nand the eij throughout, and the matrix value for \u0003, as in Refs.\n6 and 10. For nitrides, the lattice mismatch is different in the\nc direction than in the a direction, hence the misfit strain has\na value \u00010c in the z direction and a different value \u00010a in the\nx and y directions. For the isotropic approximation, we use a\nthree-dimensional average of this, taking \u00010= \u00012\u00010a+\u00010c\u0002 \/3.\nWe begin by comparing the potentials due to the interface\nbetween square and circular GaN planes and an AlN matrix.\nIn practice, the full potential in a cylindrical or cuboidal QD\nof height h will involve taking the difference between the\npotentials due to two such interfaces a distance h apart. We\nfocus here for illustrative purposes on the potential due to\none of the interfaces.\nFigure 1 shows the potential in the x-y plane at z=0 for a\nsquare plane of side 10 nm and a circular plane of radius\n10\/\u0006\u0006 nm\u2014the dimensions are chosen so that the two\nplanes have equal area. The plots are divided along the line\nfor which the radius of the circle is the same as for the cross\nsection of the square, demonstrating that the contours along\nthis line are almost identical for the two shapes. Both sur-\nfaces exhibit a large potential well in the center, which will\ncontribute to the lateral carrier confinement in the dot. Notice\nthat the magnitude of this potential can reach 2.85 V which\nis comparable to band-gap potentials, emphasizing that\nbuilt-in potentials must be accounted for in calculations in-\nvolving nitrides. The square geometry introduces only slight\nvariations to the circular distribution, which rapidly become\nless noticeable on moving away from the dot. Figure 2 shows\nthe potential along the central z axis as a function of distance\nz from the square and circular planes of Fig. 1. It can be seen\nthat the potential along this axis due to the two planes is\nalmost identical, with at most a 0.55% difference between\nthe two.\nExperimental studies indicate that real nitride quantum\ndots have a truncated hexagonal pyramid shape,9 for which\nthe potential needs to be calculated numerically. However,\nthe discussion above suggests that the potential within a trun-\ncated hexagonal pyramid dot should be well approximated\nFIG. 1.

Use of this approximation reduces the potential varia-\ntion to a function of two variables \u0001r ,z\u0002 rather than three,\nthereby simplifying the solution of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation.\nThe surface integrals I1 and I2 for a truncated cone can also\nbe partially solved analytically \u0001in terms of elliptic func-\ntions\u0002, greatly reducing the computation time required to de-\ntermine the built-in potential. With this in mind, Fig. 3 com-\npares the total built-in potential in the x-y plane at z=0 for a\ntruncated cone and a truncated hexagonal pyramid with the\nsame height, side angle, and volume. Again, the plot is di-\nvided along the line of equal radii. Figure 4 plots the poten-\ntial in the r-z plane taken along this line, while Fig. 5 shows\nthe potential variation along the central z axis of the two\nstructures. There is excellent quantitative agreement between\nthe two potentials, with the maximum difference in potential\nalong the z axis of the order of 1.5 mV, an order of magni-\ntude smaller than the difference between the square and cir-\ncular results in Figs. 1 and 2.\nFigures 3\u20135 also illustrate some typical properties of the\nbuilt-in potential in nitride QDs. There is a large potential\ndifference between the top and bottom of the dot, which\nleads to a spatial separation of confined electrons and holes,\nsince the electrons will be attracted towards the top of the\ndot, while the holes are attracted towards the bottom of the\ndot. This results in a built-in dipole moment and a redshift of\nexciton emission energies with respect to the band-gap\nenergy.3,25 The built-in potential also provides an additional\nlateral confinement for both electrons and holes, ensuring\nthey are well-confined within the dot, close to the central\naxis.\nThe results presented in Figs. 3\u20135 were for GaN\/AlN\nquantum dot structures. We find that similar conclusions are\nalso obtained when we consider InN\/GaN systems. The rela-\ntive contribution of the spontaneous and strain-induced po-\ntentials to the total potential depends on the dot and matrix\ncompositions. For GaN\/AlN, the spontaneous and strain-\ninduced potentials contribute approximately equally, while in\nInN\/GaN, the potential is almost entirely strain-induced\n\u0001Fig. 6\u0002. The weak spontaneous potential in InN\/GaN is due\nto the small difference in the spontaneous polarization con-\nstants of the two materials, about a factor of 7 smaller than in\nGaN\/AlN. However, the decrease in the total potential for an\nInN\/GaN QD compared to an equivalent GaN\/AlN QD is\nless than might be expected, due to an increase in the strain-\ninduced contribution. This is principally caused by the larger\nlattice mismatch in InN\/GaN, which results in a greater\nmagnitude of the misfit strain \u00010. \u0001This is slightly offset by an\nincrease in the relative permittivity, \u0002r.\u0002 There is increasing\ninterest in InxGa1\u2212xN\/GaN quantum dot structures, grown by\na variety of methods.26,27 Considerable uncertainty still re-\nmains concerning the structure of these dots, including dot\ncomposition and whether the composition is constant or var-\nies through the dot. Uncertainty also persists concerning\nsome of the material parameters for nitrides, especially InN\nFIG. 3.

The sensitivity of calculated dot\nproperties to material parameters can present difficulties in\nexperimental analysis. We suggest, however, that if the ge-\nometry of a dot is accurately known from structural measure-\nments, then the surface or volume integral methods presented\nhere may prove useful in combination with other techniques\nto refine the values of some of these parameters.28\nIV. CONCLUSION\nWe have presented in this paper a straightforward method\nfor determining the built-in potential, both spontaneous and\nstrain-induced, due to a quantum dot in an isotropic nitride-\nlike system. The technique involves evaluating two integrals,\neither over the surface of the dot \u0007Eqs. \u00019\u0002 and \u000114\u0002\b or\nequivalently over the volume of the dot \u0007Eqs. \u000112\u0002 and \u000115\u0002\b.\nUnlike other methods used, it has the advantage that it is an\nentirely real-space technique, thus providing a more intuitive\nunderstanding of the factors which influence the built-in po-\ntential, as well as admitting analytical solutions in certain\ncases. We have calculated the full analytical solution for the\nbuilt-in potential in a cubic dot, and analytical solutions for\nthe potential along the central x3 axis for spherical, cylindri-\ncal, truncated cone, ellipsoidal, and spherical cap dot shapes.\nMoreover, we have shown how it is possible to obtain an\nanalytical approximation for the lateral variation of the po-\ntential close to the x3 axis, thus providing a full analytical\nexpression for the potential in the region of the central axis,\nwhere electron and hole wave functions are expected to be\nlarge.\nWe have demonstrated that the potential due to a circular\nsurface is remarkably similar to that due to a square surface\nof equal area, with even closer agreement obtained between a\nhexagonal and circular surface. This allows, in theoretical\nstudies, the replacement of a truncated hexagonal pyramid\nshape, which is the most likely shape for actual nitride dots,\nwith a truncated cone shape of the same volume. Such an\napproximation introduces only minor errors in the built-in\npotential, and can considerably simplify the solution of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation.\nFinally, we have reviewed the contributions of the strain-\ninduced and spontaneous potentials to the total built-in po-\ntential. We have shown that in GaN\/AlN systems the two\ncontribute a similar amount to the total potential, while in\nInN\/GaN the spontaneous contribution is very small due to\nthe much smaller difference in polarization constants, and so\nthe potential is almost entirely strain-induced. In both cases,\nthe piezopotential produces large electric fields along the\ngrowth direction, spatially separating confined electrons and\nholes. The potential also provides an additional lateral con-\nfinement within the dot. In conclusion, the technique pre-\nsented here provides a very useful method to calculate the\nbuilt-in potential due to an arbitrarily shaped nitride quantum\ndot, of considerable value for theoretical studies of such sys-\ntems.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank G.
