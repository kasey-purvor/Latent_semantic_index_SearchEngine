Wide acceptance of this approach is limited by poor understanding of the anatomy associated with this technique however. This was investigated through a cadaveric study. The facial artery (FA) of 16 cadaveric half faces were each identified, cannulated with coloured latex, and then dissected to give an accurate and quantified description of FA perforating branches.
