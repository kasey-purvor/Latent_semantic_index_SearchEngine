The effectiveness of the model in \nsupporting 194 primary (pupils aged 5-11 years) trainee teachers\u2019 achievement of the \nsubject knowledge standards (DfEE 1998a) required for qualified teacher status is \nevaluated and the impact of the model on trainee confidence is explored.  Features of the \nmodel that trainees, tutors and post-qualifying teachers identify as critical factors for \nsuccess are outlined and the relevance of the model for teacher professional development \nis discussed.  \n \n \n1.0 Context \n \nIn the USA, Australia and the UK there is political concern about the teaching of \nmathematics (Third International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS] 1996). This \nissue underpins international activity focusing on the improvement of mathematics \nsubject knowledge among trainee teachers and practising teachers.   \n \nResearch in the USA has identified the importance of what prospective primary \n(elementary) teachers bring to training courses.  Ball (1988) has argued that a lack of \nattention to what teachers bring with them to learning to teach may account for the reason \nwhy teachers tend to teach mathematics as they were taught themselves.  In Australia, \nHill (2000) has explored why mathematics education programmes appear to have only a \nlimited effect on trainee teachers\u2019 capacity and willingness to learn and teach \nmathematics for relational understanding (knowing both what to do and why).  She \nargues that even though trainees are trained to teach for relational understanding they \noften revert to the instrumental methods they learnt in school.   \n \n 3 \nIn the UK, the period 1998-2002 saw an unprecedented rise in national regulations (DfEE \n1998a) governing initial teacher training (ITT) programmes, including an extensive \nprescribed subject knowledge curriculum that each trainee was to be taught and assessed \nagainst.  This was a response to the perceived decline in mathematical performance by \nEnglish school pupils when viewed in a comparative international context (Second \nInternational Mathematics Study [SIMS], 1993; Third International Mathematics and \nScience Study [TIMSS], 1996).   \n \nFor practising teachers, this was paralleled by the introduction of national strategies1\n \n to \npromote pupil achievement in literacy and numeracy in England (DfEE 1998b; DfEE \n1999).  This has involved all primary schools in training and professional development \nactivities to improve the teaching skills and subject knowledge of teachers.  Evaluation \nreports on the introduction of these national strategies (OISE\/UT 2003) suggest there \nhave been improvements in the teaching of literacy and mathematics.  However, there is \nstill much variation across teachers and schools in terms of expertise, and the task of \nsustaining improvements in subject knowledge and teaching skills will require continued \nprofessional development input over many years.  Research by Basit (2003) suggests that \nthe issue of developing and improving subject knowledge is a particular issue for newly \nqualified teachers entering the profession which has not been resolved by the introduction \nof the National Numeracy Strategy (NNS).  Proposals for accredited postgraduate \nprofessional development and reform of mathematics teaching (TTA 2004, DfES 2004) \nconfirm that teacher development emphasising subject expertise remains a key \ngovernment priority for England. \nThe Open University\u2019s Postgraduate Certificate in Education (OU PGCE) subject \ndevelopment model was developed in response to this context, in order to support \nprimary trainee teachers in achieving the mathematical subject knowledge standards \nrequired for qualified teacher status.  Two major characteristics of the OU PGCE cohort \nshaped the development of the subject knowledge development model.  First, the \n                                                          \n1 Put in footnote about NLS and NNS \n 4 \nprogramme operated nationally across England, Wales and N. Ireland and trainee \nteachers were widely geographically dispersed.  The logistical demands of providing \nindividualised training, support, assessment and monitoring for a high volume, \ngeographically dispersed trainee teacher population are challenging (Banks and Shelton \nMayes, 1998).  In this context, distance-learning with programme specific text materials \nand e-conferencing is the most appropriate mode of delivery to allow trainees access to \nthe curriculum and support from tutors and other trainee teachers.  Second, the cohort\u2019s \nentry qualifications, in terms of mathematical subject knowledge, were highly variable.  \nThis meant that the approach to developing subject knowledge needed to be highly \ndifferentiated, allowing individual trainees to focus on and develop in specific identified \nmathematical areas in relation to personal need. \n \nThese issues of variable access to professional development linked to geographical \ndispersal and diversity of professional development needs are shared by practising \nteachers.  The model may have relevance, therefore, to those planning professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers in the context of the continued national focus on \nimproving mathematics teaching.   \n \n \n2.0 Research Study \n \nThe research presented in this article relates to a cohort of 194 primary ITT trainees on \nthe OU PGCE2\n                                                          \n2 Open University Postgraduate Certificate in Education is an accredited initial teacher training programme \nleading to qualified teacher status.  \n (1998-2001) who were the first, in the UK, to undertake the formal \nprocess of subject knowledge development in mathematics and English for qualified \nteacher status, through integrating e-learning with conventional distance learning \nmaterials. The OU PGCE programme pioneered the use of an e-environment in ITT for \ntrainee communication and support purposes.  The e-environment annually received the \nhighest trainee course approval ratings (OU PGCE 1996-2001).  The mathematics subject \n 5 \nknowledge model reported in this study, evolved from the continual refinement of this e-\nenvironment. \n \nThe study considered these questions:  \nWas this subject knowledge development model effective in supporting trainees in \nachieving the mathematical standards for qualified teacher status? \nWhat features of the model contributed to successful trainee development? \nWhat relevance does the model have for teacher professional development? \n \nThe research evidence is drawn in part from a larger study (Burgess & Shelton Mayes, \n2001) undertaken to analyse the developing subject knowledge of primary trainee \nteachers on this programme.  Data are also drawn from a follow up questionnaire sent to \nthis cohort of qualified teachers in their third year of teaching as part of an ongoing \nlongitudinal study.  This was critical in determining whether successful features of the \nmodel identified by trainees and tutors were confirmed from the perspective of qualified \nteachers.  The following sources of data were used to assess the effectiveness of the \nsubject knowledge development model in terms of trainee achievement of national \nstandards. \n \n\u2022 194 primary trainees were involved in e-conferencing producing data consisting of \n1403 messages relating to mathematics subject knowledge (Burgess and Shelton \nMayes 2003) \n\u2022 entry and exit mathematical subject knowledge trainee outcomes were compared as \nthe basis for judging the effectiveness of the subject knowledge development model.  \nThe exit outcomes were independently confirmed by the national inspection agency \n(Office for Standards in Education (OfSTED) 2001) \n\u2022 interviews with the mathematics subject knowledge tutors \n\u2022 programme questionnaires  \n\u2022 a follow-up questionnaire to the 194 graduates in 2003 (Respondents N=63) (See \nTable 1) \n \n 6 \nIn addition to the specific data sources identified above, the ITT programme was set up to \ngenerate ongoing data for evaluative and improvement purposes (Banks and Shelton \nMayes 1998).  Programme specific quality assurance procedures provided sources of \nevidence, including trainee monitoring and observation records, and reports from tutors \nand school-based mentors.  Information from course questionnaires completed by \ntrainees were also included.  Benigno and Trentin (2000) identify questionnaires for on-\nline course evaluations as a valuable source of research data.  In addition, the requirement \nby national external inspection agencies (e.g. OfSTED) to provide information on trainee \nprogress led to the development of detailed trainee case studies and quantitative data on \ntrainee outcomes.  Research evidence, therefore, is taken from a variety of sources \nproviding both quantitative and qualitative data.  The use of different research methods \nand detailed analysis of evidence allows for triangulation of data and provides research \noutcomes that are both verifiable and trustworthy (Wilcox 1993, Burgess and Shelton \nMayes 2003).  \n \n \n3.0 The Subject Knowledge Development Model \n \nThe mathematics subject knowledge development model was conceptualised as a three \nstage process of identification, personal development and directed support. (See Figure 1)  \nAlongside a conventional distance-learning self-study text (Centre for Mathematics, \n1998, Passport to Mathematics) and face-to-face workshops, the e-environment was \norganised as a hierarchy of conferences for specific teaching and learning purposes, such \nas mentoring, peer support and coaching, to reflect a mathematics subject culture.  E-\nconferencing provided the integrative dimension in this model, functioning throughout \nthe course as the primary mode of communication and support as well as, at different \npoints, a direct teaching medium and a monitoring tool for quality assurance purposes.  \n \nINSERT Figure 1 \n \n(Burgess and Shelton Mayes 2003.) \n 7 \n \nThe e-community was organised around e-conferences reflecting the mathematics subject \nculture. .  In stage 1 of the programme, the trainees shared ideas relating to their \npedagogic subject knowledge and supported each other in preparation for teaching \nexperience.  In stage 2, a mathematics subject knowledge e-conference was set up.  \nTrainees developed the subject knowledge required by the national standards, through \nresponding to directed tasks set by tutors.  In this e-learning environment both peer group \nand tutor support were strongly in evidence, facilitating discussion and mathematical \nproblem solving.  In stage 3, the mathematics subject knowledge conference was \nextended to form a series of six specialist sub- conferences focusing on discrete \nmathematical areas to support direct trainee-tutor coaching.  Trainees also had access to \ntheir own personal mailbox for more private communication, for example, \ncommunicating assessment outcomes and setting targets.  This e-environment is broadly \nsupporting two different modes of working - a community of practice involving \ncollaborative working with peers, facilitated by tutors and individual direct teaching and \nassessment (Burgess and Shelton Mayes, 2003). \n \nUsing an e- environment made it possible to design an open-ended model where teaching \nand learning were not tied to a series of fixed sessions in a classroom or allocated to a \nspace on a timetable.  Instead, the model was premised on multiple opportunities for \ntrainees to re-visit and re-test subject knowledge with support and without penalty until \nthe standards required were successfully achieved.  Research by Burgess and Shelton \nMayes (2003) has indicated that subject knowledge development in mathematics requires \nan environment of support for trainee teachers and the opportunity to return to concepts \nagain and again, without the threat of failure.  A learning environment that encourages \n 8 \nincreased confidence in subject knowledge will also encourage trainee teachers to be \nmore confident in their teaching  \n \nThe philosophy underpinning the model was premised on minimizing negative emotional \nresponses to mathematics as a subject; promoting connections between subject content \nknowledge and school pedagogical knowledge; and providing opportunities for \ncollaborative working, peer and tutor support and direct coaching. \n \nThere was an emphasis on developing the trainee mathematics teacher as a thinking \nprofessional who knows and understands the subject matter and pedagogy of \nmathematics.  As Edwards and Collinson (1996) have argued: \nTraining to be a thinking professional demands more than reflection on practice. It needs \nopportunities for the consideration of wider professional issues and the creation of a cast \nof mind which regards initial training as the start of a long process of professional \ndevelopment. (Edwards & Collinson, 1996, p.158). \n \nThe role of emotion in the dynamic of learning and teaching is widely acknowledged and \nyet it was not until 1980 that researchers began to use theoretical frameworks and \nmethods to evaluate emotion in the classroom (Boekaerts, 1996).  Research by Elbaz \n(1983) has suggested that the images that teachers have of themselves, their role in the \nschool and their academic and personal criteria, all have considerable influence on how \nthey use and present knowledge to their pupils.  Images of the self and professional self \nare inextricably bound together (Nias, 1989) and therefore, how trainee teachers construe \ntheir developing understanding of mathematics teaching and learning needs to be \nunderstood in the context of personal belief about mathematics teaching and emotional \nresponse to the subject.  Schuck (1998) argues that one of the reasons for lack of success \nin challenging trainee teachers\u2019 views of mathematics and mathematics teaching is that \nthe engagement between trainee and teacher educator is an engagement with an \ninappropriate \u2018self\u2019 of the trainee.  She proposes that trainees engage in different ways \nwith their mathematics education courses through the perspective of three \u2018selves\u2019: \n\u2018student-learning-to-teach\u2019; \u2018primary-school-student\u2019; and \u2018teacher\u2019.  Brown et al (1999) \n 9 \nargue that for primary teachers, the initial transition from school learner of mathematics \nto the trainee teacher of mathematics is an important part of the complex process of \nlearning to teach.  If the transition is to be successful, it involves for many \u2018a considerable \ndegree of \u2018unlearning\u2019 and discarding of mathematical baggage, both in terms of subject \nmisconceptions and attitude problems\u2019 (Brown et al, 1999, p.301).  This is also evident in \nMeredith\u2019s work (1993), whose research suggests that there is a need to clarify the \nrelationship between prior learning and attitudes towards pedagogical content knowledge.  \nOther research on affective issues in mathematics education has focused on high levels of \nanxiety (Newstead, 1998) and protection of self-worth (Thompson, 1993).  Such \nemotional responses to knowing and doing mathematics has also been recognised by \nBibby (2002), who argues that shame is a reaction to other people\u2019s criticisms.  The \nmodel of interaction between tutors and trainees within this e-environment draws on the \nissues that emerge from the research outlined above.  \n \nWe considered it essential that this subject knowledge development model should not \nincrease negative responses to mathematics as a subject.  Trainee teachers\u2019 comments \ndrawn from the e-conferencing environment are very revealing in terms of the feelings \nand emotional responses to beginning teaching.   \n \nI was dreading the mental maths session as I had been told to keep it brisk. My first \ncouple of lessons I warmed up my brain by giving myself questions and checking \nthem using different methods. I made sure I really challenged the top attainers in \nY6 by asking two or three part questions. For lower attainers I still asked two\/three \npart questions but made the steps slightly easier. This also gave children the \nopportunity to work together on parts or help others out. Different children could \nanswer different parts. I have come away from three weeks of fast mental maths \nwith new strategies and an ease with numbers that I do not think I have ever had \nbefore. Just shows that more work with mental maths makes one much more \nproficient \u2013 give me 17X table any day.  \n \n 10 \nSuccesses were shared alongside problems as trainees identified with the \u2018dread\u2019 of the \nunknown and elation at success. \n \nDitto! I\u2019m on SE3 at the moment in Y5\/6 and every Friday they have an hour (!) of \nmental maths!! Today\u2019s lesson was great. They love it, my strategies are improving \ntoo.  \n \nDeveloping subject knowledge and practical teaching skills and ideas for lessons were \nshared with vivid descriptions of experiences in numeracy lessons.  \n \nMy own mental maths improved so much over (second placement) \u2013 I saw patterns I \ndid not know exist before \u2013 talk about learning with the children! (I used to be the sort \nof person that could work things out as long as I had a piece of paper and pen). They \nparticularly liked \u201cdarts score\u201d \u2013 doubles and triples \u2013 I was particularly pleased \nwhen most hands went up \u2013 it was a job to stop them calling out and making those \ngrunting noises when they know the answer and want to be chosen. Even the children \nwho did not put their hands up worked the answers out when I picked them. I found \nmyself really looking forward to the sessions.   \n \nThe e-environment encouraged the trainees to be specific about activities in teaching \nnumeracy and some shared sharply observed experiences. A lesson that was planned at an \nappropriate level meant all the children in the class could respond to the activities and \nresulted in the mutual pleasure of teacher and pupils. As well as individual comments \nabout experiences and sharing ideas, whole strands of applying subject knowledge to \npractical classroom situations were developed as the trainees supported each other in their \ndeveloping professional practice.  Often, the conversational strands were initiated by \ntutors who would encourage the trainees to focus on a particular aspect of numeracy. In \nthe example below, a tutor has set up the strand by providing trainees with a list of mental \nstrategies, taken from the NNS, to be introduced year by year. The trainees were asked to \ndraw on their third school experience to focus on methods of developing mental \nstrategies with their pupils, and to identify their problems as well as their successes.  \n 11 \n \nTrainee 1. \n\u2026\u2026.after one or two days practice at using the cards, we could maintain a fast \npace during these sessions, due to the enthusiasm of the class and a clear \nintroduction to the sessions, so that all knew what they were to do. I have since had \nsome positive feedback from the Head (my mentor) who felt that these mental maths \nsessions appeared to be both very beneficial as well as being fun. This has spurred \nme on no end, particularly as I have never considered maths to be one of my \nstronger subjects!!  \n \n \nTrainee 2. \nI was interested to read your comments on using cards with Y1 classes. I tried with my \nY2 class and found it very difficult. The children were not used to using this type of \nresource and it took some of them a long while to find the correct cards - then they \noften reversed the numbers when they held them up. While waiting for all the class to \nfind the correct cards other became restless and started chatting, however if I moved \non too quickly them the lower attainers became bored as they couldn\u2019t keep up. I \nthought a solution to this may be to differentiate questions between tables, but this too \nbecame confusing, as they were then unsure of which questions to answer. Can anyone \nsuggest how this system worked for them?  \n  \nTrainee 3. \nI have used Number Cards in the past and found that the first thing I had to do was \ntake away the elastic bands! After this I had the same problem but I got the children \nwho had the answer to put one hand on their head so I knew they had the answer and \nwith the other hand use their pencil and write down the answer to doubling it tripling \nit etc. Perhaps you could just ask your Y2 to add or subtract?  \n \nThis short strand identifies how important it is for trainees to have feedback from \nexperienced teachers as in the case of Trainee 1 who was greatly encouraged by the \n 12 \npositive response from the headteacher.  The trainee identified mathematics as one of her \nweaker subjects and yet was \u2018spurred on\u2019 to develop and extend her knowledge and \nteaching skills.  Trainee 2 had attempted a similar activity with her Year 2 class and \nfound her numeracy lesson to be far more problematic.  She had issues linked to \nmanagement of the activity yet to resolve successfully and maintaining the interest and \nenthusiasm of the children was also problematic.  Unable to solve the problems herself \nthe student sought help from her peers and tutors in the electronic environment.  The \nresponse came from one of her peers, Trainee 3, who had noted the despair in the \nmessage and began by trying to lift her spirits by making a joke about elastic bands.  The \nadvice that followed was both practical in terms of managing the pupils while at the same \ntime gently suggesting that her peer simplify the activity.  \n \nTutors intervened or commented in a variety of supportive, practical and encouraging \nways on the subject knowledge strands.  On some occasions the tutor simply reinforced \nthe positive feelings of the trainees and made a link back to subject knowledge to \nreinforce what the trainee was learning. \n \nYou feel good \u2013 and I expect the children do too. Great. And perhaps you understand \nsomething about fluency that might help with subject knowledge!    \n \nOn other occasions more practical advice was offered.  A discussion of children\u2019s \nmisconceptions linked to 3D shapes led to the following advice from a tutor: \n \nIt\u2019s a good idea to build up your own collection of 3D shapes. (You need a good box to \nkeep them in). Get the children to look out for good ones \u2013 reward donations with smiley \nfaces etc and your collection will soon expand. A good home-school activity.  \n \nThe electronic environment enabled trainees to extend their knowledge in a supportive \nenvironment through allowing them to comment on their feelings and experiences of their \nteaching placements.  Emotional responses to teaching were accepted as valid comments \nalongside more practical and mathematical issues.  The recognition of trainees as \n 13 \nindividuals who need emotional support and understanding, as well as practical \nknowledge and intellectual inspiration, helped to engage the trainees as active \nparticipants in their own developing professional practice in mathematics teaching.  The \ncomments from trainees demonstrate the emotional benefit gained from their peers and \ntheir tutors in the electronic environment. In addition, there is strong evidence that the \nmodel was very effective in terms of developing mathematics subject knowledge.  \n \n \n4.0 Successful features of the model \n \nThe following evidence points to the effectiveness of the OU subject knowledge \ndevelopment model in supporting primary trainees in achieving the prescribed national \nstandards in mathematics subject knowledge.   \n \nThe OU PGCE primary cohort of 194 trainee teachers were all postgraduates with a \ndiverse range of first degree subject specialisms.  Ninety trainee teachers had a degree \nspecialism in a mathematics\/science\/design & technology area however more than 50% \nhad only the minimum entry level of mathematics (GCSE C grade or an access \nequivalent3\n                                                          \n3 GCSE is the national examination for 16+ years and graded A*-E \n).  The challenge for the majority of trainees, who had an average age of 35 \nand had achieved the basic entry mathematical qualification at age 16, was significant.  \nNevertheless, by the end of the programme, 99% of all trainees had achieved the required \nstandard for mathematical subject knowledge with 76% judged \u2018good\u2019.  This successful \noutcome was confirmed through an external independent OfSTED inspection (OfSTED \n2001) by the award of a Grade 2 (good) on a four-point scale for trainee mathematical \nsubject knowledge.  The OfSTED criteria for this grade states that all trainees, who pass \nthe course, must achieve the standards for mathematical subject knowledge and that more \nthan 70% of the cohort must achieve a \u2018good\u2019 subject knowledge outcome \n(OfSTED\/TTA 1998).  This independent inspection confirms that the subject knowledge \ndevelopment model was highly effective, particularly given the broad base of trainees\u2019 \n 14 \nentry level knowledge.  Indeed, an analysis of the final subject knowledge grades showed \nthat 57.6% of those trainees identified as requiring the highest level support (i.e. lowest \ndiagnostic assessment scores \u2013 29.6% of the cohort) had achieved a \u2018good\u2019 subject \nknowledge outcome.  This suggests that the programme was able to provide a \u2018value-\nadded\u2019 dimension where trainees perform better than might be expected based on their \nentry level of subject knowledge. \n \nThe views of practicing teachers who had trained using this model were sought during \ntheir third year of teaching.  77.8% of respondents rated the OU subject knowledge \ndevelopment model as useful or better in developing their personal subject knowledge, \nwith 14.3% rating it at the highest level.  However, when asked to rate the model\u2019s \nimpact on their self-confidence to teach mathematics in their first teaching post, the \nresponses were markedly more positive with 85.8% rating the model as helpful, with \n19.2% rating it at the highest level.  Those who rated it less useful were those who \nidentified a personal high level of mathematics subject knowledge on entry, for example \na prior degree with a mathematics or science specialism.   \n \nThe interviews with tutors revealed that lack of confidence was a major issue for many \ntrainees, confirming research undertaken by Bibby (2002) and Thompson (1993).  \nMacNab & Payne (2003) have researched the beliefs and practices of Scottish primary \nschool mathematics teachers and found that their trainees felt more confident teaching the \nmore structured aspects of mathematics and that they were least confident using problem \nsolving strategies and mathematical procedures.  It has also been argued by Stipek et al \n(2001) that those who have greater self-confidence in their mathematics ability are more \nlikely to use inquiry oriented methods in their teaching of mathematics.  Their research \nsupported our research findings by demonstrating that teachers\u2019 self-confidence as \nmathematics teachers was significantly correlated with trainees\u2019 perceptions of their own \ncompetence as mathematics learners.  The primary teachers, who had been OU trainees, \ncommented that the methods used to support their subject knowledge development in \nmathematics helped with solving problems, maintained their motivation and enabled a \n 15 \ntransition to using new methods to understand and teach mathematics that they had not \npreviously used.   \n \nAll the above [electronic conferences, text materials, tutor & peer support and face-to-\nface] linked in with each other very well: e.g. problems were resolved by any of the above \nbeing referred to \u2013 the face-to-face days being the reliable \u2018last resort\u2019. \n \nI felt that I was very much responsible for my own learning and was very self-motivated.  \n \nIt provided an excellent transition between the \u2018old\u2019 maths I learnt at school and the \n\u2018new\u2019 maths taught now \u2019 \n \nThis link between self-confidence and perception of competence is corroborated by the \nresponses of the OU cohort, indeed the majority of comments related specifically to the \nissue of confidence.  Their responses resonate with the work of Stipek et al who suggest \nthat greater confidence as a learner of mathematics leads to teachers who are more likely \nto be confident of their teaching ability in the classroom. The positive approach by tutors \nand peers as trainees developed their mathematics subject knowledge helped most OU \ntrainees to avoid adverse responses to teaching the subject, as suggested by Bibby (2002) \nin research that explored the impact of negative criticism on the emotional responses of \nmathematics learners to the subject. \n \nI felt most confident when working through subject knowledge with my peers\/fellow \nstudents and when supported face-to-face \u2013 I need interactive learning \n \n 16 \nDeveloping confidence in my own ability, my growing enjoyment of the subject and \nseeing children\u2019s knowledge grow and \u2018fear\u2019 of maths disappear. \n \nI was confident that there would be nothing in the primary maths curriculum that I would \nbe unable to teach in a variety of ways.  \n \n\u2018 Having completed the maths \u2018on-line tests and worked through all the maths module \nactivities as well as having read the suggested references (\u2026)I was confident from day \none\u2019  \n \n\u2018it gave me the confidence to develop plans (for my class) that moved in very small steps \nso that I was able to bring a huge range of entry to school into a much closer knit cohort \nat the end of the year\u2019 \n\u2018as a mature PGCE student I had learnt maths the \u2018old way\u2019 I could do it but not \nunderstand   (and therefore explain) it.\u2019 \n \n\u2018I battled with self-doubt because I had such poor maths tuition as a schoolchild myself\u2019.  \n(\u2026) Studying maths was an eye-opener for me (\u2026) I had only ever \u2018done\u2019 maths in one \ncertain way \u2013 it was almost scary to suddenly de-construct numbers and mix up strategies \n\u2013it helped take away that debilitating fear of \u2018getting it wrong\u2019 and maths became \nenjoyable at last. \n \nSome commented that they believed that their self-confidence was linked to the practical \napplication or delivery of the subject rather than the development of personal subject \nknowledge.  They were critical of a national policy that had forced a separation of subject \nknowledge and pedagogy through the assessment of personal subject knowledge \nrequirements of trainees (DfEE 1998a).  Despite the unanimous acknowledgement \n(100%) that good personal subject knowledge is important to the effective teaching of \nprimary mathematics, there were a number of negative comments on the OU subject \n 17 \nknowledge development process.  These reveal the frustration of a cohort subjected to \nexternal government subject knowledge standards, which they believed required greater \nlevels of personal mathematics subject knowledge than was necessary for the demands of \nteaching in primary schools.  Comments included: \n \n\u2018KS1 (teaching) does not lend itself to improving subject knowledge \u2013only methodology\u2019 \n \n\u2018what I was taught would benefit those teachers working with older pupils\u2019\u2026 \n \n\u2018Some aspects were above the level which is appropriate\u2019 \n \nThis is further illustrated by the significant difference between Key Stage 1 (KS1) and \nKey Stage 2 (KS2) teachers\u2019 responses.  70% (N=30) KS1 teachers reported that the OU \nsubject development model was useful or better in developing their personal subject \nknowledge for teaching rising to 84.8% (N=33) for teachers working in KS2.  Similarly \n80% KS1 teachers reported that the model was helpful or better in developing their \nconfidence for teaching rising to 90% for KS2 teachers.  This suggests that neither the \ngovernment standards, nor indeed the OU PGCE programme team, had been successful \nin persuading trainees and teachers of the importance of developing personal subject \nknowledge that extends beyond that directly required to teach a specific age-group.  The \nseparation of pedagogy and subject knowledge in the national subject knowledge \nstandards exacerbated this perception.  It is interesting to note that the revised national \nstandards (DfES 2002) removed the prescriptive atomised subject knowledge curriculum \nand replaced it with a standard that requires only that qualified teacher have appropriate \nsubject knowledge to teach specific age-groups.   \n \nAlongside confidence-building, other features appear to be successful in supporting \ntrainees learning.  First, the staging process of self-auditing and diagnostic auditing, \ninherent in the model, allowed tutors to focus on specific trainees and target their \ncoaching to individual need.  This is likely to be a critical factor in the support of those \ntrainees who entered the programme with low levels of subject knowledge.  Specific case \n 18 \nstudies on the progress of some trainees in this category support the success of this \nstrategy.   \n \nSecond, the high levels of support that were provided because trainees were \ngeographically isolated and because the model was based within an e-environment were \nundoubtedly a factor that helped to make it effective.  The cohort rated levels of peer \nsupport (68.3%) as highly as the tutor support in e-conferences (71.4%).  Direct coaching \nwas one of the supportive strategies used by tutors.  In this strategy the trainee works \ndirectly one-to-one with a tutor. It is both intensive and supportive.  Research by Oldroyd \nand Hall (1991), has demonstrated that coaching is likely to have a greater impact on \npractice than simply a presentation of the theory.  The key word is doing, being engaged \nin the activity of working a problem through.  In many respects this is similar to \nmentoring and shares some of the positive and negative features of this activity.  One of \nthe essential differences is that a mentor will counsel and listen but not necessarily tell a \ntrainee what to do while in direct coaching the tutor is directing the trainee, through their \ninterventions, towards a particular outcome.  Direct coaching was a common strategy in \nthe specialist sub-conferences where trainees were required to prepare answers to \nquestions set by tutors in specific mathematics areas linked to the outcomes of the \ndiagnostic assessment and directed towards a deeper understanding through detailed \nfeedback provided by the tutor (see Burgess and Shelton Mayes, 2003, for an appraisal of \ntutor support strategies). \n \nThird, in using and developing strategies of peer support and collaborative working the \ntrainees were committed to helping each other achieve success in their mathematics \nsubject knowledge and assignments.  They shared the common goal of improving their \nmathematics knowledge in order to improve the quality of their teaching.  Swafford \n(1998) has argued that peer coaching is non-evaluative and non-judgmental encouraging \na community of learning where teachers can investigate and explore alternatives, \nimplement new strategies and explore again.  We would argue on the basis of evidence \nfrom our research, that such strategies build confidence in trainee teachers and therefore \ncan have a positive impact on the outcome of mathematics subject knowledge \n 19 \ndevelopment.  It is interesting to note that 60.3% of OU PGCE graduates were still in \ncontact with alumni from their cohort three years into their teaching career. This suggests \nthat even though the trainees were on a distance learning course and rarely met, the \nelectronic environment as a community of learning was a very powerful medium with \nenduring consequences.   \n \nFourth, all the modes of learning and support operated within a common mathematics \nframework.  Six mathematical areas provided the common structure for the subject \nknowledge learning and support model through the self-study text, the e-conference \nenvironment and face-to-face teaching sessions.  An individualised subject knowledge \ndevelopment plan was created from a diagnostic profile.  Trainees were able to move \neasily between different modes of learning and support and make connections. Of the \nvarious components of the OU subject knowledge development model, the cohort rated \nthe Passport to Mathematics as most useful (87.1%) followed by face-to face support \n(79.4%), which was offered primarily to those trainees who required additional support.  \nAll other forms of support received an overall positive response with mentor support \ngaining the lowest positive response (61.9%).  This supports Ofsted inspection reports \n(Ofsted,1999) which suggests that school-based mentors do not play a significant role in \nsubject knowledge training in ITT.   \nFifth, high levels of tracking and quality assurance were built into the model with the \nprogress of all trainees monitored in the e-environment.  Additional face-to-face support \nwas provided for trainees who did not appear to be making sufficient progress in the \ndevelopment of their subject knowledge.  The cohort rated this strategy very highly \n(79.4%) in terms of positive support for their subject knowledge development.  It was \nevident in the questionnaire responses that maintaining good mathematics subject \nknowledge continued to be important to these trainees in the early years of their teaching \ncareers. \n \n 20 \n \n6.0 Teacher professional development in early career \n \nOverall this research suggests that perceptions of mathematics and trainees emotional \nresponses to the subject and to the e-environment in which they learned and extended \ntheir subject knowledge all appear to play a part in a successful outcome.  The challenge \nbeyond qualifying is for teachers to maintain their confidence in their mathematics \nsubject knowledge, extend that knowledge and continue to enhance their teaching skills \nand professional practise.  \n \nThe responses of the OU cohort in the third year of their teaching career raises some \ninteresting points for planning teacher professional development.  87.4 % of the cohort \nreport improvements in their subject knowledge during the first years of teaching and \nidentify a range of strategies undertaken to improve their understanding, illustrating a \ncommitment to ongoing professional development.   \n \nConventional modes of teacher professional development, such as school-based and \nexternal in-service training and published materials remain the most commonly accessed \nstrategies (93.7%, 87.3% and 85.6% respectively) and received the highest ratings in \nterms of usefulness.  Given this cohort\u2019s experience in using e-learning as trainees, there \nwas little indication that this was a preferred strategy with only 57.1% reporting using \nteacher specific e-environments as a medium for learning.  This may be a reflection of the \ncurrent paucity of e-environments for teacher professional development or given the \nfeatures that the cohort rated most strongly in terms of the OU model, including peer and \ntutor support and structured support for individualised progress, this may reflect the \ndesign of e-conferences for teacher education.  Surprisingly too, 60.3% of the cohort \ncontinue to use OU PGCE training materials to support their professional development. \n 21 \nMaintaining and developing subject knowledge as a practising teacher was not \nuniversally recognised by the teachers, who followed the OU programme, as their \nteaching roles were not demanding in this respect.  Here there was a strong difference \nbetween Key Stage 1 (5-7 age range) and Key Stage 2 (8-11 age range) teachers.  The \nlatter less inclined to value a breadth of personal subject knowledge extending beyond \nthat directly relevant to teach their specific 5-7 age range.  However, it was revealing to \nnote that 96.8% of teachers, who had qualified with the OU, felt confident to informally \nsupport other teachers in teaching mathematics and 80.6% felt confident to undertake \nmore formal support, for example through leading school-based training.  This has \nimportant implications for the future of school-based initial teacher training where these \nteachers would be able to play a stronger role than is currently expected of mentors in \nsubject knowledge training.  It also suggests there is a developing reservoir of teachers \nwho feel confident to engage in supporting colleagues.  This would accord with the \nTeacher Training Agency proposals (TTA 2004) to prioritise the collaborative nature of \nteacher professional development.  \n \n \n6.0 Conclusion \n \nThis study makes a significant contribution to the debate on teacher education pedagogy \n(Edwards & Ogden 1998).  In the context of international focus on the importance of \npersonal subject knowledge in the area of mathematics for primary teachers, this study \noffers a model that has successfully supported UK trainees with low levels of personal \nsubject knowledge on entry to a teacher training programme.  The follow-up study \nseeking the views of practising teachers, who qualified on this programme, helps to \nestablish why it has potential as an effective model for practising teachers.  The teachers \nrated the mathematics subject knowledge development model, an integrated conventional \ndistance learning with an e-learning coaching and peer group conferencing environment, \nvery highly.  In addition, a surprising number of teachers were still using the training \nmaterials in their scheme and lesson planning for teaching mathematics. \n \n 22 \nIt offers a distance learning and e-learning approach to subject knowledge development \nwhich may provide greater access for potential teachers to enter the profession through \nundertaking part of their professional studies part-time and at a distance.  There was \nevidence that trainees who had used this approach to their subject knowledge \ndevelopment were committed to further professional development in subject knowledge \ntraining.  The research also indicated that the teachers wanted to see much more \nintegration of subject knowledge training with classroom pedagogy and this was \nparticularly evident in the responses from the KS1 teachers.  The practitioners considered \nthat some of the subject knowledge they had been required to learn was not relevant to \ntheir teaching of very young children, and they would have appreciated greater \nconcentration on links to practical application in early years settings. \n \nAn analysis of the subject knowledge development model in the context of other research \nsuggests significant features that can support trainee learning, particularly through \nenhancing self-confidence in mathematics.  Our research emphasises the importance that \npeers have in the learning process.  A key feature in the learning processes in the \nelectronic environment was the support, advice and knowledge gained and shared \nbetween trainees.  A number of trainees continued to use the OU\u2019s e-learning conferences \nafter they had completed the programme and remained in contact with each other.  Peer \nsupport, tutor mentoring and coaching can be successfully embedded in e-learning \nenvironments and as part of the TTA strategy for teacher professional development could \nsignificantly enhance continuous learning for practising teachers.  The teachers in our \nstudy demonstrate the self-confidence to take on a development role in schools.  \nHowever, the analysis showed that few teachers had been able to continue their \nprofessional development through e-learning and there appear to be limited opportunities \nfor teachers to continue their development through this medium.   \n \nFinally, it should be noted that UK (England) government agencies, such as the TTA, \nhave stipulated high level entry qualifications as an indicator of quality on initial teacher \ntraining programmes and all initial teacher training providers are required to provide \nannual data for publication (TTA, 2000).  However, this study has shown that trainees \n 23 \nwith a broad range of entry qualifications can achieve equally good subject knowledge \noutcomes.  The evidence from the qualified teachers in this study indicates that such \ntrainees do maintain high levels of confidence in their subject teaching in the early years \nof their teaching careers. This has implications for government policies on setting entry \nrequirements to teacher training programmes and future professional development \nprogrammes for practising teachers.  \n \n \nReference \nBall, D.L.
