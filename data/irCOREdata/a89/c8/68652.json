INTRODUCTION\nTo establish from experimental data whether or not two or\nmore interacting processes are synchronized is an old and\nimportant problem. In the absence of noise, the existence of\nsynchronization between two processes in interacting limit\ncycle oscillators was originally taken to imply that their basic\nfrequencies of oscillation are related as integer numbers ~i.e.,\nare rationally connected! @1,2#, and that their instantaneous\nphases are permanently locked. This definition suggests that\nthe detection of whether or not synchronization exists can be\nestablished by computation of the ratio of basic frequencies\nin the Fourier spectrum of the signal from one of the sub-\nsystems involved. Even in this simplest case, however, the\nfinite observation time and the discreteness of the digitiza-\ntion steps used in practice will make it appear that all fre-\nquencies are rationally connected, thereby complicating the\nreliable estimation of their ratio. Furthermore, the noise that\nis invariably present in all real macroscopic systems means\nthat only effective synchronization @3# can normally take\nplace, meaning that the phases can remain locked only dur-\ning finite time intervals, and that the basic frequencies may\nno longer be rationally connected @4#. Serious difficulties\nmay also arise due to the nonstationarity of experimental\ndata.\nIn view of these problems, modern techniques for estab-\nlishing the presence or absence of synchronization are based\non the assumption that the behavior of each subsystem can\nbe considered separately, and that their individual time series\ncan be compared by a variety of techniques ~e.g., by compu-\ntation of the phase difference between them!. This approach\nhas been justified theoretically @3\u20136# and is widely used to\ndetect synchronization, not only in periodic noisy, but also in\nchaotic @7\u201310# oscillators, and even between stochastic @11\u2013\n15# processes. Its principal assumption is quite reasonable\nwhere the system is being forced externally, when one is able\nto measure both the forcing and response signals @16#, or for\nmutually coupled oscillators of radiotechnical @8,9,17# or\nbiological @18# origin, or for biological systems such as iso-1063-651X\/2002\/65~3!\/036211~12!\/$20.00 65 0362lated neurons @19#, or in any situation when a living system\nis artificially split into separate subsystems for research pur-\nposes, usually by means of surgery or drugs ~thereby disrupt-\ning its natural functional state! @20\u201323#. However, in practice\nthere are not many opportunities to measure noninvasively\nseparate signals coming from different interacting processes\nwithin a living system: the independent registration of sig-\nnals derived from respiration and from cardiac activity @24\u2013\n28# is one of the very rare examples.\nIt remains an open problem how best to learn from the\none-dimensional signal coming from a system, within which\nseveral processes with distinguishable time scales interact,\nwhether or not the processes in question are synchronous. In\nRef. @29# it was suggested that the interaction of processes in\nthe autonomic regulation of the human cardiovascular sys-\ntem could be studied by the application of ideas from ethno-\nmusicology to univariate time series ~heart rate data!. How-\never, this approach is tightly linked to the physiological\nnature of the particular data and cannot be applied in general.\nAnother possibility that has recently been demonstrated @30#\nis to filter a univariate time series to create two \u2018\u2018separate\u2019\u2019\nsignals that can then be analyzed for synchronization phe-\nnomena in the usual ways already developed for bivariate\ntime series.\nIn the present paper we propose a more general approach\ntowards detecting the presence or absence of synchronization\nbetween two or more interacting processes from univariate\nexperimental data. A preliminary report @31# introducing the\nmain idea has already been published. The aims of the\npresent paper are, first, to give an explicit relation between\nthe new variable introduced for univariate data and the con-\nventional variables used in synchronization theory. Second,\nwe extend the approach to encompass the case of several\ninteracting processes.\nIn Sec. II the basic idea of the approach is outlined, ex-\nplicit models for the angles of return times maps are derived\nfor an oscillator that is forced either periodically or quasi-\nperiodically, and the relation between the angles and the con-\nventional phase difference is established. In Sec. III the latter\nrelation is demonstrated on a model of nonstationary forced\u00a92002 The American Physical Society11-1\nJANSON, BALANOV, ANISHCHENKO, AND McCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036211oscillations and the method is tested. The results are summa-\nrized and discussed in Sec. IV, and conclusions are drawn in\nSec. V.\nII. ANALYTIC DESCRIPTION FOR THE IDEAL\nNOISE-FREE CASE\nA. General idea and experimental observations\nThe central idea of the proposed approach is based on the\nsimple fact that, if m periodic processes with different fre-\nquencies interact weakly enough within a single system, an\nm-dimensional torus exists in its phase space @2#. The case of\ntwo interacting processes is illustrated by Fig. 1~a!, showing\na two-dimensional torus as the attracting set. To quantify\nmotion on this torus, the rotation number j is introduced as\nthe ratio between the basic frequencies of the interacting os-\ncillators. It specifies how many periods of one oscillator fall\nwithin a single period of the other oscillator.\nIf the processes are not synchronous, the rotation number\nis irrational. The phase trajectory then fills the whole torus\nsurface and is never closed, and thus its Poincare\u00b4 map is a\nclosed curve. If the processes are synchronous, the rotation\nnumber is rational. In this case, distinct stable and unstable\ncycles lie on the torus surface, and the phase trajectory tends\ntowards the stable limit cycle. The Poincare\u00b4 map consists of\none or several stable points belonging to the stable cycle and\nan equal number of saddle points belonging to the saddle\ncycle lying between the stable points on the closed curve\nFIG. 1. ~a! Surface of a two-dimensional torus. The point O is\nsome origin in whose vicinity the motion occurs. The saddle cycle\nSC ~dashed line! is that from which the torus was created as a result\nof a Hopf bifurcation. The phase trajectory moves along the torus\nsurface and makes two kinds of rotation: around the point O with\namplitude R, and around the cycle SC with amplitude r. ~b!

Arrows show the direction of stable and un-\nstable manifolds of saddle equilibria. f i is the current angle, ri is\nthe current amplitude. ~c! Illustration how the points jump on the\nPoincare\u00b4 section of a two-dimensional torus.03621formed by the unstable manifolds of the saddles as shown in\nFig. 1~b!. To consider the dynamics of the Poincare\u00b4 map,\nplace the origin somewhere inside the region bounded by the\nclosed curve and introduce the phase angle f i and phase\nradius ri @Fig. 1~b!#. At each discrete time moment t i when\nthe trajectory returns to the Poincare\u00b4 secant surface, the\nphase vector rotates by some angle. It is obvious that for the\nsynchronous regime there is a discrete number of possible\nvalues of f i , and for the asynchronous one the angle f i may\ntake any value between @2p; p#. The geometrical meaning\nof the rotation number is then the average angle by which the\nphase vector rotates at each step @Fig. 1~c!#,\n^f i2f i21&52pj , ~1!\nwhere ^fl& means an average over time.\nIf some general noise ~with large enough tails in its dis-\ntribution! perturbs the system, only effective synchronization\ncan take place @3#. In terms of the Poincare\u00b4 section this\nmeans that, at every step, noise prevents the phase point\nfrom jumping exactly to the stable point, but makes it jump\ninstead to the vicinity of the stable point. However, at a\ncertain moment, a large enough fluctuation may throw the\nphase point outside the region bounded by the two stable\nmanifolds of the nearest saddle points, and the phase point\nthen moves along the unstable manifold to another stable\npoint @Fig. 1~b!#. The latter stage of the dynamics is associ-\nated with phase slip. Thus, instead of one or a few discrete\npoints, one observes one or a few clouds of points smeared\naround the stable equilibrium\/equilibria, and possibly also\nthe trace of the unstable manifolds forming the torus. The\nlatter situation is illustrated by Fig. 2~a! where a stroboscopic\nsection is shown for a Van der Pol system under harmonic\nforcing while affected by Gaussian white noise,\nx\u02d95y ; y\u02d95e~12x2!y2v0x1C sin Vt1ADm~ t !. ~2!\nHere, the nonlinearity parameter e50.1, eigenfrequency v0\n51, forcing amplitude C50.1, forcing frequency V\n51.025, m(t) is a random value with a Gaussian distribu-\ntion, zero average and unity variance, and the noise variance\nD50.1.

In Fig. 2~a! black points show the strobo-\nscopic map of system with noise, and the white diamond in\namong the bulk of the black ones shows the position of the\nstable cycle in the noise-free system. Here, the angle f i can\ntake any possible values, but those corresponding to the vi-\ncinity of stable equilibrium are the most probable. Effective\nsynchronization manifests itself in a sharp increase in the\nduration of the time intervals without phase slips.\nAccording to the Takens theorem @32# and its extension to\nnoise-affected system @33#, the system\u2019s attractor can be re-\nconstructed from its one-dimensional time series. Obviously,\nthe Poincare\u00b4 map can also be restored from the reconstructed\nphase trajectory, being topologically equivalent to that of the\noriginal system. In Refs. @34,35# it is shown that the same\nmap can be reconstructed from return times of the system.\nConsider a map for the angles of a return times map,\nf i5 f ~f i21!. ~3!\nThe technique of plotting such a map has already been ap-\nplied to reveal determinism in the R-R intervals of anesthe-\ntized dogs @36# and in the human heart rate during paced\nrespiration @37#, and in jet atomization @38#. The distinctive\nshape of the maps observed in all these works was attributed\nto interaction between the particular processes involved. Her-\nzel et al. @36# and Suder et al. @37# suggested approximate\nempirical models to describe the dynamics of such maps, but\nwithout linking them to the general theory of synchroniza-\ntion or developing an analytic description.\nSome typical examples of such a map are shown in Fig.\n3~a! for the noise-free Van der Pol system ~2! with e50.1\nand the small forcing amplitude C50.01, for several values\nof forcing frequency V varying from 0.25 to 0.9. The basic\nfrequency of the oscillations is close to v051, and thus the\nrotation numbers j are close to the corresponding values of\nV. Note that, for j51\/2, one observes a 1:2 synchronization\nthat is reflected by the presence of only two points in the\nmap of Fig. 3~a! ~the most distant point from the diagonal in\nthe lower-right part of the picture and the closest point to the\ndiagonal in the upper-left part!, and that the whole return\nfunction is not seen here since we removed all transients.

Here and in what follows, the axes of the maps\nfor angles have the limits @2p; p#.\nB. Derivation of the map for angles of return times map\nfor two interacting processes\nIn this subsection we will clarify the physical meaning of\nthe angles of return times map and will relate it to the con-\nventional phase difference. We will also derive the map de-\nscribing the evolution of angles with time.\nConsider a very simple case of a forced system, namely, a\nperiodic self-sustained oscillator with eigenfrequency v0 and\namplitude R that is forced harmonically at frequency V and\namplitude r. As a result of the forcing, a two-dimensional\ntorus is born @Fig. 1~a!#. If the nonlinearity in the oscillator is\nweak, its autonomous solution can be approximated by a\nsinusoidal function of time, and the oscillator is then called\nquasiharmonic. If the harmonic forcing is also weak, r!R ,\nthe solution of the resulting nonautonomous equations can be\napproximated by a superposition of: one sine term coming\nfrom the unforced system and describing rotation around\nsome origin O, i.e., oscillations with frequency v and ampli-\ntude R @as shown in Fig. 1~a!#; and a second sine term cor-\nresponding to rotation around the saddle cycle ~SC! ~the\nformer limit cycle of the autonomous system from which the\ntorus was born via a Hopf bifurcation!, i.e., oscillations with\nthe frequency of external forcing V and amplitude r. Thus\nx~ t !5R sin vt1r sin~Vt1f0!, r!R , ~4!\nwhere f0 is the initial phase shift. Note that frequency v\ncoincides with the eigenfrequency v0 of the autonomous\nsystem in the absence of synchronization. In the presence of\nsynchronization, it is shifted in the direction defined by the\nforcing. If the oscillations are synchronized by the forcing,\nthe rotation number of the whole system under consideration,\nhere denoted as j5V\/v , is equal to n\/m , where n, m are\nintegers.\nDefine the return times of the system as the time intervals\nbetween successive crossings by the signal x(t) of a thresh-\nold x50 in one direction. To find the time moments tk of\nthese crossings one should solve the transcendental equation\nx(t)50, which in general has no analytic solution. Let us\nmake use of the fact that the first term is much larger than the\nsecond one, and, therefore, that the times tk of zero crossing\nby x(t) are close to the times tk*5pk\/v of zero crossing by\n(R sin vt). We expand the function x(t) as a Taylor series in\nthe vicinity of tk* , considering only the linear term and ne-\nglecting all the others:\nx~ t !5R sin pk1r sinS Vv pk1f0D1RvS t2 pkv D cos pk\n1rVS t2 pkv D cosS Vv pk1f0D50.\nNoting that cos pk5(21)k, and in order to consider every\nsecond zero crossing so as to register intersections in only\none direction, we set k52i ,1-3\nJANSON, BALANOV, ANISHCHENKO, AND McCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036211S t2 2piv D FRv1rV cos S 2piVv 1f0D G52r sin 2piVv .\nThe t we seek is the ith moment of crossing,\nt i52\nr sinS 2piVv 1f0D\nRv1rV cosS 2piVv 1f0D\n1\n2pi\nv\n. ~5!\nDivide the numerator and denominator of the first term of\nEq. ~5! by r.

Note that Eq. ~11!\nwas quoted earlier as Eq. ~6! of Ref. @31#, without detailed\njustification.\nC. Analysis of angles for two interacting processes\nFirst, note that, if the amplitude of forcing is much\nsmaller than the amplitude of natural oscillations in the sys-\ntem, the map ~3! does not depend on the amplitudes and is\ncompletely defined by the rotation number j. The ambiguity\nin defining the value of arctan that is periodic with the period\np, not 2p, implies that the return function in Eq. ~11! is not\ncontinuous but makes a jump by p at the point f50, thus\nbeing not one-to-one. Moreover, the function arctan itself\nvaries between 2p\/2 and p\/2. To draw the return function\nfor angles in a proper way, reflecting its distinct physical\nmeaning, we just leave the value of f i if f i21>0 and sub-\ntract p from f i if f i21,0. When referring to maps ~11!, or\n~19! below, we will assume them to have been extended by\nthis procedure.\nSecond, note that the map ~11! does not depend on the\ninitial phase shift f0 between the solution components.\nThird, note that the return function of Eq. ~11! is periodic\nwith respect to the variable j with period 1, because the\ncosine function takes equal values for the arguments 2pj, or\n2p62pj , or 2pl62pj ~where l is an integer! if 0<j\n<1. Denote j*5(1\/2p)arccos(cos 2pj), so that j* or (1\n2j*) is the fractional part of the true rotation number lying\nwithin the interval @0;1#. Then the true rotation number j can\nbe expressed via j* as\nj5j*1l , or j5~12j*!1l . ~12!\nThus, from the map for angles only j* can be defined. To\nselect one of the two formulas in Eq. ~12! and find l, the\nFourier spectrum of the original signal x(t) can be helpful,\nsince for this purpose only a rough estimate of the basic\nfrequencies is required. To simplify further consideration, we\nwill take j to mean the value of j* which in all numerical or\nreal data examples given in this paper coincides with true\nrotation number.\nFourth, it follows from Eq. ~11! that ~i! if j51\/4, the\nreturn function is the straight line f i5f i212p\/2 ~ii! for any\nvalue of j the return function passes through the points ~0;\n2p\/2! and ~p;p\/2! and touches the line f i5f i212p\/2 at\nthese points.\nA series of return functions of Eq. ~11! for several values\nof j between 0.25 and 0.9 inclusive @the same values as in\nFig. 3~a!# are shown in Fig. 3~b!. The results are in good\nagreement with Fig. 3~a!, showing that return functions de-\nrived theoretically appear to coincide with those obtained\nfrom a numerical simulation.1-4\nPHASE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN . . . .

Another useful observation is that even in the\ncase when a weakly chaotic oscillator is forced periodically,\nthe map for angles may sometimes look very similar to that\nfor noise-influenced forced or interacting periodic oscillators.\nIn Fig. 4 a map for angles of return times is given for the\nRo\u00a8ssler oscillator @40# in a chaotic regime forced periodi-\ncally. The form of the equations is taken to be as in @41# with\nthe following parameters values: eigenfrequency v51; a\n50.2; b50.2; m510; and the forcing frequency v150.3\nwith amplitude C50.5.\nTo reveal the physical meaning of the angles, return to Eq.\n~8!. Here, C i is the phase of external forcing taken at the\ntime moments 2pi\/v when the phase of basic oscillations\nwith frequency v changes by 2p. Note that in general C i\ndefines the phase of external forcing up to some constant. If\nC i is wrapped into the interval @2p;p# @which does not\nchange the value of tan(Ci 1u\/2)#, it is by definition the\nso-called relative phase introduced in Ref. @25#. Consider the\nphase difference between two signals, C\u02dc (t)5F1(t)\n2F2(t), and the values of C\u02dc at time moments t i when the\nphase of one signal, e.g., F2 , changes by 2p,\nC\u02dc ~ t i!5C\u02dc i5F1~ t i!22pi . ~13!\nWrapping of C\u02dc i into the interval @2p;p# implies C\u02dc i\n5F1(t i).

A typical return function of\nthe map ~14! is shown in Fig. 5. Let us make a comparison of\nmap ~11! with map ~14!.\nThe formal difference between Eq. ~11! and the sine circle\nmap is the presence of two points at which the distance be-\ntween the return function and the diagonal is minimal, in-\nstead of only one such point. An important distinction is that\nthe map ~11!, unlike map ~14!, does not depend on the am-\nplitude of forcing and is thus always one-to-one, so no chaos\ncan be described by it. Another important feature is that the\nreturn function of Eq. ~14! can cross the diagonal, as param-\neters K and d are varied, while in the map ~11! it can only\ntouch the diagonal at two points where j50 or j51, but\nnever crosses it.\nIt is obvious that, when ~i! the approximation of a quasi-\nharmonic oscillator is not valid, and\/or ~ii! the oscillator is\nnot being forced harmonically, and\/or ~iii! the amplitude of\nforcing cannot be considered small, the real map will differ\nfrom that predicted theoretically. However, even where one\nor more of ~i!\u2013~iii! apply, but the torus still exists, the quali-\ntative picture remains the same, i.e., for the synchronous re-\ngime we will obtain a finite number of points, whereas for\nthe asynchronous one the map will look like a continuous\ncurve.\nWe have, therefore, arrived at a diagnostic criterion for\nthe existence of synchronization, or the lack of it, between\ntwo noise-free interacting processes manifested within a one-\ndimensional signal.\nD.

Note that for more than two interacting\nprocesses the resulting map for angles depends on the initial\nphase shifts f j\n0\n. First, one can check that, if the second forc-\ning signal is absent, it coincides with Eq. ~11!. Second, if the\nfrequency of the second forcing signal tends to zero, Eq. ~19!\nalso tends to coincide with Eq. ~11!. Third, if b2 is not zero,\nthe map ~3! is in fact a nonautonomous system, and the forc-\ning represents a nonlinear function of harmonic terms with\ntwo independent frequencies, V1 and V2 , added to a return\nfunction that is similar in form to Eq. ~11!. Thus, if the map\nfor angles f i is a one-dimensional curve ~or close to it in the\npresence of noise! one can conclude that only two periodic\nprocesses with different time scales are involved in the inter-\naction. But if the map is far from being a one-dimensional\ncurve, this implies that there are at least three interacting\nprocesses with different time scales.\nExamples of what the phase portrait of the map ~19! looks\nlike for four different sets of parameters are shown in Fig. 6.\nDenote the \u2018\u2018partial\u2019\u2019 rotation numbers as j i j , where the in-\ndices i and j mean the numbers of the processes, and the\nindex 0 signifies the \u2018\u2018basic\u2019\u2019 process of frequency v.

The case\nwhen all three rhythms are synchronous is reflected by a\nfixed number of points in the map, is thus trivial, and so is\nnot illustrated here.\nIII. TESTING THE METHOD ON MODELS WITH NOISE\nA. Two interacting processes\nOne of the simplest situations encountered in real ~espe-\ncially living! systems is the interaction of two periodic pro-\ncesses with different time scales. It may, however, be com-\nplicated by nonstationarity and by noise. First, consider a\nstationary process in a periodic oscillator with periodic forc-\ning under the influence of noise. In Fig. 2~b! the map for\nangles of return times is shown for the case of effective 1:1\nsynchronization of Van der Pol system whose stroboscopic\nsection is given in Fig. 2~a!. Here, the upper cloud of points\non the diagonal corresponds to the smeared stable equilib-\nrium of the stroboscopic map @white point in Fig. 2~a!#, and\nthe other points are related to the trace of the unstable mani-\nfold. The thin black line plots the return function of map ~11!\nfor j51, and the map points fall on it with high accuracy.\nNow let us simulate a typical experimental situation when\nthe interacting processes are nonstationary, and the nonsta-\ntionarity exhibits itself in a slow random variation of the\neigenfrequency of oscillations. Consider the Van der Pol os-\ncillator ~2! with a randomly varying parameter v, which for1-7\nJANSON, BALANOV, ANISHCHENKO, AND McCLINTOCK PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036211small e is approximately equal to the basic frequency of os-\ncillations, under external harmonic forcing:\nx\u02d95y , y\u02d95e~12x2!y2v2x1C sin Vt ,\nv5v01\nDh\nt\nh~ t !, h\u02d952\nh\nt\n1m~ t !, ~20!\nfor e50.1, v051, C50.2 V50.3\u02d9 . m(t) is Gaussian white\nnoise @^m(t)&50,^m(t)2&51# , h(t) is colored noise with\nvariance Dh and correlation time t5200.\nThe presence or absence of synchronization between self-\noscillations and forcing can easily be detected by the con-\nventional method for bivariate data, i.e., by plotting the time\ndependence of the phase difference between the forcing and\nthe response DF(t)5Fr(t)23F f(t), where Fr(t) is the\nphase of forced oscillations ~\u2018\u2018response\u2019\u2019! in the system ~20!,\nand F f(t) is the phase of the external forcing. Consider\nDF(t) at the moments t i when the signal x(t) returns to zero\nin one direction, i.e., when the phase of oscillations changes\nby 2p. In the absence of noise (Dh50) a 1:3 phase synchro-\nnization arises, and is detectable through the associated pla-\nteau around zero on a DF(t) plot over the whole observation\ntime; the corresponding map ~3! consists of three points ~this\ncase is trivial and is not illustrated here!. For noise variance\nDh50.15 nonstationary oscillations take place in the system\nexhibiting epochs of effective 1:3 phase synchronization,\nwhich are detectable through the presence of plateaus, and\nintervals where phase difference slides slowly @Fig. 7~a!#.\nFIG. 7. Comparison of different methods to detect phase syn-\nchronization for a forced Van der Pol system with slowly and ran-\ndomly varying eigenfrequency, Eq. ~20!. Parameter values are given\nin the text. The first two rows of plots were derived from bivariate\ndata and are ~a! the conventional phase difference DF i between\nresponse and forcing; ~b! relative phase C i ; ~c! map of relative\nphase C i11 vs C i . The third and fourth rows are obtained from\nunivariate data: ~d! angles of return times map; ~e! map of angles;\n~f! angles transformed by means of Eq. ~8!; ~g! map of transformed\nangles.

In Fig.\n7~d! the angles f i of return times map @45# are shown and\ntheir map is given in Fig. 7~e!.\nNext, we analyze the behavior of the system using only\nunivariate data, namely, the variable x(t). From Eq. ~8! the\nrelative phase C i* is reconstructed from angles f i whose\ntemporal dependence and map are given in Figs. 7~f! and\n7~g!, respectively. Note the remarkable correspondence of\nFigs. 7~b! and 7~f!, and 7~c! and 7~g!, which clearly demon-\nstrates that the relation ~8! still holds even for strongly non-\nstationary processes. Another significant observation is that\nmaps in Figs. 7~c! and 7~g!, being in fact classical circle\nmaps ~compare with Fig. 5! are very close to being straight\nlines, thereby confirming that the forcing was indeed weak.\nB. Estimation of rotation number from the angles map\nIn Ref. @25# a method was suggested to find the rotation\nnumber j5n\/m of synchronization from relative phase C i :\nthe relative phase is extended to the interval @0;2pn# , the\nnumber n being found by trial; once n is found, the number\nm is given by the number of horizontal stripes in the plot C i\nversus i. The situation becomes complicated if the process is\nnonstationary and the transition occurs from synchronization\nwith numerator n1 to that with n2 , where n2\u00den2 , etc. Then\none has to find all possible ni\u2019s by trial and error and to\nestimate all the j i corresponding to each different epoch of\nsynchronization, which can require time and patience.\nBut we have shown theoretically in Sec. II C for the ideal\nstationary noiseless case, and confirmed by simulation in\nSec. III A for a nonstationary case, that the relative phase C i\ncan easily be obtained from the angles of return times map,\nprovided that the interaction is weak. Then, in principle, we\ncan apply the already developed technique to the angles and\nthus estimate the rotation number. However, the angles map\nhas a noticeable advantage over the relative phase, namely,\nthat the shape of a particular angles map is explicitly defined\nby the value of the rotation number j. That means that one\ncan estimate j directly from the map without needing to\nsearch for the correct value n of the numerator. Equation ~10!\ncould be used for the ideal noiseless case, which of course\ndoes not arise in reality. In real life situations one can esti-\nmate j as an average over some temporal window,\n^j&5\n1\n2p arccos\ns\n2 , s5^tan f i1cot f i21&, ~21!\nwhere ^fl& implies an average over the window. As one re-\ngime gives way to another, the value of ^j& changes, respec-\ntively.\nThe rational rotation number n\/m describing synchroni-\nzation should be close to the one defined by Eq. ~21!, which\nwe will further refer to as \u2018\u2018average rotation number,\u2019\u2019 though\nnot precisely equal to it ~due to noise and nonstationarity!. It1-8\nPHASE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN . . . . I. . . . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036211should be noted that the number of clouds in the angles map\ndoes not in general allow one to define the rotation number\nimmediately, because it gives only its denominator m. The\nsame number of clouds m will exist for synchronization with\nany n, though the clouds will be placed differently. To find\nthe numerator n we suggest finding the approximate rotation\nnumber ^j& using formula ~21!, and then seeking the integer\nn closest to the value m^j&.\nHowever, before applying formula ~21! we should check\nthat it is valid under the circumstances in question, i.e., that\nthe processes under study interact weakly. The most straight-\nforward way to check this is to obtain the value of ^j& from\nEq. ~21!, to plot the corresponding return function, and to see\nif it fits experimental map for angles well enough. If it does,\nwe can accept this ^j& as an approximation of the true rota-\ntion number; but if not, we cannot rely on the value in\nquestion.\nThere is also a straightforward way to estimate the rota-\ntion number from the angles f i by using its definition ~1!.\nHowever, to do so one needs to be able to extend the discrete\nangle f i in order to make it increase monotonically. In the\npresent paper we use only formula ~21! to estimate the rota-\ntion number.\nThe rotation number ^j& for the case of Fig. 7~e! is ap-\nproximated by formula ~21! as 0.333 27...; the number 3 of\nparallel stripes in Figs. 7~b!, 7~d!, 7~f! gives the denominator\nm; and thus the true value of the rotation number correspond-\ning to the epochs of phase locking is 13. The return function\nof map ~11! for j5 13 fits the plot in Fig. 7~e! with high\naccuracy and cannot be distinguished from it, thereby con-\nfirming that the interaction is weak.\nC. Three interacting processes\nThe situation where more than two processes with differ-\nent time scales interact is one that is often encountered in\ncomplex living systems. We, therefore, consider the case of\nthree interacting processes in systems affected by weak\nnoise, which we will take to be Gaussian. It is clear that the\naddition of even weak noise will smear the plots in Fig. 6,\naffecting our ability to detect synchronization between the\ndifferent processes. However, the extent of the effect will\ndiffer for different rhythms. Namely, closed loops as in Fig.\n6~d! are likely to become hard to distinguish from a large\nnumber of discrete points; but we will still observe three\nisolated clouds of points pointing to synchronization between\nthe basic rhythm and the one with smaller amplitude with\nrotation number j5 13 . Similarly, the conclusions about the\nabsence of synchronization between the basic rhythm and\nthose with smaller amplitude as illustrated by Fig. 6~c! will\nremain valid even in the presence of noise.\nHowever, noise will definitely prevent one from making\njudgments about the fine structure of such plots, thus render-\ning it almost impossible to establish whether or not the pro-\ncesses with smaller amplitudes are synchronized with each\nother. Fluctuational smearing of the plot in Fig. 6~c!, for\nexample, will prevent one from identifying the number of\nnonclosed curves ~because two of them are likely to merge!,\nand smearing of the plot in Fig. 6~d! will prevent one from03621distinguishing whether each cloud represents a smeared loop\nor consists of several smeared points.\nIn view of these problems we suggest an extension of our\nmethod to remove from consideration the basic rhythm,\nthereby enabling us to focus our attention on the smaller\namplitude processes. Namely, after detecting synchronization\nor otherwise between the main rhythm and the one of the\nremaining two, we propose to proceed as follows. Plot the\nreturn times Ti vs i and form a new dataset consisting of all\ntheir local maxima ~or minima! as shown in Fig. 8~a!. Now\ntreat the new data as an independent time series resulting\nfrom the interaction of only two processes. One can plot for\nthese data the map of angles and then analyze it by analogy\nwith Sec. III B.\nThis approach can be realized in application to experi-\nmental data only in cases where the frequency of the basic\nprocess is larger than those of smaller amplitude. However,\nthis condition is often satisfied in practice, as will be illus-\ntrated @46# in relation to human heart rate variability data.\nTo demonstrate the workability of this technique, we ap-\nply it to the Van der Pol system forced quasiperiodically and\ninfluenced by noise,\nx\u02d95y , ~22!\ny\u02d95e~12x2!y2v0x1C1 sin V1t1C2 sin V2t1ADm~ t !\nfor e50.1, v051, C15C250.1, V150.5, V250.1, D\n50.000 01.

In Fig. 8~a! the sequence of return\ntimes Ti extracted from coordinate y(t), and all its local\nmaxima, are shown. In Fig. 8~b! the map for angles is shown\nfor Ti , which consists of two clouds of points ~black points!\nlying on a return function ~11! for j5 12 ~thin black line!,\nbeing evidence of 1:2 synchronization between the basic pro-\nFIG. 8.

At this stage, it is\ndifficult to decide from looking at the map whether or not the\nsmaller amplitude processes are synchronous. Now, plot the\nmap for angles for the set of local maxima of Ti @Fig. 8~c!#.\nOne can clearly distinguish five separate clouds of points\nhere, pointing to synchronization between the processes with\nsmall amplitudes, the denominator m of the rotation number\nbeing given by the number of clouds. A rough estimate of the\nrotation number by Eq. ~21! gives 0.212 36 which is close to\n1\n5 ~the corresponding return function is shown by a thin black\nline!, and so the correct rotation number of 15 has been suc-\ncessfuly extracted.\nNow, apply our technique to the case when only partial\neffective synchronization in Eq. ~22! takes place. Set e\n50.1, v051, C150.3, C250.17, V150.333 001, V2\n50.1001, D50.0001. In Fig. 9~a! a map for angles of return\ntimes is plotted. Three clouds of points testify to the effective\n1:3 synchronization between the basic rhythm and forcing\nwith frequency V1 . The \u2018\u2018average rotation number\u2019\u2019 calcu-\nlated from this map by use of Eq. ~21! is 0.333 333, which is\na very good approximation of 13. With this, the map for\nangles for local maxima of return times shown in Fig. 9~b! is\nrather smeared by noise and displays no effective synchroni-\nzation between forcings. The average rotation number\nfrom Eq. ~21! is 0.2801 . . . , which is close to the actual\nfrequency ratio of the processes under consideration j12\n50.300 599 . . . . The return function for the map ~11! with\nparameter j50.3, shown by a thin black line, seems to fit the\nmap points reasonably well.\nThus, the technique described above seems to be able to\nprovide information about synchronization, or its absence,\nbetween each consecutive ~first with second, second with\nthird! pair of three processes interacting within a nonlinear\nsystem, even in the presence of noise.\nIV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\nTo summarize, we have proposed an approach to the de-\ntection of synchronization ~or the lack of it! between two or\nseveral processes interacting within a single system, using\nFIG. 9. Quasiperiodically forced Van der Pol system with noise\n~22!. The basic process is synchronous with that with V2 .

The thin black lines show return functions of Eq.\n~11! for ~a! j51\/3, ~b! j50.3.036211only a one-dimensional signal coming from it. The approach\nis based on plotting the map of angles of the return times\nmap, and studying its dynamics. We have revealed an ex-\nplicit relation between the angles of return times map and the\nphase difference between interacting processes. The validity\nof this relation is confirmed also for nonstationary processes\nin a model.\nExplicit maps have been derived describing the behavior\nof the angles-of-return-times map for a system with a limit\ncycle forced by an arbitrary number of harmonic signals of\nsmall amplitude. The maps obtained appear to describe well\nnumerically simulated data under appropriate conditions.\nAll the formulas describing the angles\u2019 behavior can be\nderived not only for the return times map, but also for the\nstroboscopic map reconstructed from a one-dimensional sig-\nnal by the delay method. Moreover, as numerical simulations\nhave shown, they also fit well angles of Poincare\u00b4 sections\nreconstructed from one-dimensional time series. The reason\nfor presenting the above discussion in relation to the return\ntimes map, rather than for the stroboscopic map, comes back\nto the reason for writing this paper: to obtain a stroboscopic\nsection we would need to link ourselves to an external forc-\ning, or to a signal from interacting partial subsystem, and\nthese are by definition absent or unknown in the context of\nthe problem posed.\nAlthough the same ~or similar! formulas should in prin-\nciple be obtainable for the reconstructed Poincare\u00b4 map\nwithin the framework of our starting suppositions ~4!, ~15!,\nwe failed to do so because of the complicated transcendental\nequations that arise.\nGiven a one-dimensional time series, we can find the map\nfor angles by reconstructing either the Poincare\u00b4 or the return\ntimes map. Both of these operations seems equally valid and\nshould lead to the same results for dynamical systems. How-\never, in practice, data from medical or biological experi-\nments are often already presented in the form of return times,\nlike R-R intervals of human electrocardiogram. Moreover,\nthe algorithm for extraction of return times can be simpler\nthan that for the Poincare\u00b4 section, the latter being connected\nwith restoration of the phase portrait in a multidimensional\nphase space and searching for intersection of the phase tra-\njectory with a secant hypersurface. Of course, one should\ndecide for oneself which method is preferable in any particu-\nlar case.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nBased on the results presented above, we arrive at the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFor two weakly interacting processes, the angles of return\ntimes map can be transformed to a relative phase by means\nof Eq. ~8!.\nWithout noise, when a weak periodic forcing is applied to\na periodic oscillator, the dynamics of angles of return times\ndoes not depend on the amplitude of forcing and is com-\npletely defined by the rotation number. When a periodic os-\ncillator is forced quasiperiodically and weakly, the dynamics\nof angles is defined not only by partial rotation numbers, but\nalso by the ratios of the forcing amplitudes.-10\nPHASE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN . . . .

PHYSICAL REVIEW E 65 036211The technique of eliminating the higher-frequency com-\nponents by extracting local extrema from the return times\nallows one to reach a judgment about the synchronization or\notherwise of each successive pair of processes involved, for\nat least three processes.\nWe, therefore, expect that the proposed approach is likely\nto be useful in application to the analysis of different kinds\nof real data, for example, biological. It is applied to heart rate\nvariability data in the paper @46# that follows.036211ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are much indebted to Dr. Alexander Neiman for valu-\nable discussions and for his constructive comments on a draft\nversion of the manuscript.
