INTRODUCTION\nThe hole-doped 3d transition-metal oxides have been\nstudied extensively over the past few years due to their re-\nmarkable physical properties; the most interesting being the\nhigh-temperature superconductivity displayed by the\ncuprates1 and the colossal magnetoresistance ~CMR! shown\nby the manganites.2 The three-dimensional half-doped perov-\nskite manganite systems have been studied intensely in order\nto investigate the relationship between the charge, spin,\nstructural and orbital degrees of freedom. The electronic and\nmagnetic properties have been studied in an effort to achieve\nan understanding of the mechanism associated with the CMR\nbehavior. Neutron-, electron-, and x-ray-diffraction tech-\nniques have allowed the behavior of the charge, spin, and\nstructural properties to be investigated thoroughly, and re-\ncently it has also been possible to investigate the behavior\nof the orbital degree of freedom using resonant x-ray scatter-\ning techniques.3,4 However, more work is needed to under-\nstand the relationship of orbital ordering with the other de-\ngrees of freedom in the system and the electronic and\nmagnetic properties.\nThe magnetoresistive properties are very sensitive to the\ndimensionality of the manganese oxide lattice, and by insert-\ning rock salt layers between manganese oxide sheets it is\npossible to dramatically vary the electronic and magnetic\nproperties of the system. This group of compounds are\nknown as the Ruddlesden-Popper series, and they have the\ngeneral formula (La, Sr)n11MnnO3n11 where n is an integer.\nThe n51 single-layered perovskite La0.5Sr1.5MnO4 shows\nno metallic or ferromagnetic state,5 while the n5\u2018 , which\ncorresponds to the cubic perovskite structure, shows the\nCMR effect.6 By varying the value of n, the properties of the\nsystem are dramatically changed, and they should eventually\napproach those of the cubic system as n is increased towards\ninfinity.\nThe bilayer system, as shown in Fig. 1, has the I4\/mmm\ntetragonal space group lattice parameters with a5b.3.87 \u00c5\nand c\u201920 \u00c5. The presence of the rock salt blocker layer has\nthe effect of reducing the dimensionality, and in the x50.4\ndoped system there exists a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic\ntransition at 126 K with a huge accompanying change in the\nCMR.7\nBy changing the ratio of lanthanum to strontium, holes are\ndoped into the system, and this changes the electronic and\nmagnetic properties. For the half-doped bi-layer system the\nstructure within the a-b plane is the same as that in the\nhalf-doped three-dimensional ~3D! manganites and the\nsingle-layered n51 manganite. The bilayer system would\ntherefore be expected to display the same charge\/orbital or-\nder checkerboard state seen in the 3D manganites, which was\npredicted by Goodenough in the 1950s.8 A schematic of the\nproposed ordering of the manganese ions at a height of z\n;0.1 and ;0.9 is shown in Fig. 2. The manganese ions at\nheights of z;0.4 and ;0.6 are similarly ordered, but with an\norigin shift of ~0.5, 0.5, 0!. The bilayer system is often in-\ndexed with a5b5ap as opposed to the 3D systems where it\nis indexed with a5b\u20192Aap. This corresponds to a rotation\nof the a and b axes by 45\u00b0, and in this model the superlattice\nPHYSICAL REVIEW B 67, 205110 ~2003!\n0163-1829\/2003\/67~20!\/205110~9!\/$20.00 \u00a92003 The American Physical Society67 205110-1\nreflections should occur at modulations of QCO\n5(0.5,0.5,0) and QOO5(0.25,0.25,0) for the charge and or-\nbital order, respectively. The true orbital order supercell is\nsmaller than that shown in Fig. 2 with space group Amam.\nHowever, we have chosen to use the larger supercell in order\nto be consistent with the previous literature. This pattern\nhas been found in the 3D manganites Nd0.5Sr0.5MnO3,9\nPr0.5Ca0.5MnO3 ,10 and in the layered type perovskite\nLa0.5Sr1.5MnO4.3\nElectron11,12 and x-ray-diffraction studies13 have shown\nthe presence of a charge and orbitally ordered state at low\ntemperatures. In the electron-diffraction measurements by Li\net al.11 and Kimura et al.,12 the appearance of charge order\nreflections at ~0.25, 0.25, 0! around the Bragg peaks below\n220 K was reported, and that they maximize in intensity\nat approximately 180 K before disappearing at 100 K. In\naddition, x-ray-diffraction studies have been performed using\nresonant x-ray scattering and high-energy x-ray scat-\ntering.13,14\nAmong the x-ray and electron-diffraction measurements,\nthere has been some disagreement in the position of the\ncharge, Jahn-Teller, and orbital order satellites in the litera-\nture. The electron diffraction measurements by Kimura\net al.12 and the high-energy measurements of Chatterji et al.\nreported that the charge order satellites occurring at a modu-\nlation of ~0.25, 0.25, 0! around the Bragg peaks. However,\nthe resonant measurements carried out by Wakabayashi\net al.14 have reported the charge order at a modulation of\n~0.5, 0.5, 0! and the signal due to the orbital order at ~0.25,\n0.25, 0!. In this paper we will clarify the correct positions of\nthe charge and orbital order. We postulate that the modula-\ntion that occurs at ~0.25, 0.25, 0! seen at high energy and\nusing electron diffraction is caused by co-operative Jahn-\nTeller ordering on the Mn31 ions, which consists of an elon-\ngation of certain Mn-O bonds. This elongation of the bond\nlength causes the Mn41 ions to move from their high-\ntemperature position, which results in a lowering of the sym-\nmetry of the crystal structure. The charge order from the true\nMn31\/Mn41 pattern occurs at a modulation of ~0.5, 0.5, 0!.\nHere we report on a high-energy and resonant x-ray scat-\ntering study of charge and orbital ordering within the\nLa222xSr112xMn2O7 system for the doping levels x50.5\nand x50.475. The x50.475 sample is of interest because it\nis very close to the 0.47 boundary below which the charge\nordered state is not observed and has not been reported on by\nthe previous x-ray measurements.13,14 By observing the be-\nhavior of the charge ordered state in the x50.475 sample\nand comparing the results with those from the x50.5\nsample, it is hoped to understand the charge ordered region\nof the phase diagram as shown in Fig. 3.\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\nHigh-quality single-crystal samples of\nLa222xSr112xMn2O7 with x50.5 and 0.475 were grown us-\ning the floating-zone method at the University of Oxford.\nThe x50.5 and 0.475 samples had dimensions 631.5\n30.5 mm3 and 63431 mm3, respectively.\nFIG. 1.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 67, 205110 ~2003!\n205110-2\nThe high-energy x-ray studies were carried out at the\nHamburger Synchrotronstralunglabour ~HASYLAB! at\nDESY, Hamburg, on the high-energy wiggler beam line\nBW5.16 The incident beam was monochromated using a\ngraded Si12xGex crystal in transmission geometry. The\nsample, located in a closed cycle He cryostat with a tempera-\nture range from ;10 K to ;300 K was mounted in triple-\naxis geometry on a four-circle diffractometer. A similar\ngraded Si12xGex crystal was used as an analyzer crystal and\nthe scattered x rays were detected with a solid-state Ge de-\ntector. Both samples were mounted with the @110# and @001#\ndirections lying within the diffraction plane.\nThe resonant x-ray scattering experiments were carried\nout on the XMaS beam line BM28 at the ESRF in Grenoble,\nFrance.17 The incoming beam was monochromated by means\nof a constant exit double-bounce silicon ~111! monochro-\nmator and focused using a pneumatically bent silicon mirror\ncoated with rhodium. The sample was mounted on the 11-\naxis, 6-circle Huber diffractometer within a closed cycle He\ncryostat similar to that used at BW5. Measurements were\nundertaken in the vicinity of the manganese K edge, corre-\nsponding to an energy of 6.555 keV. Polarization analysis\nwas provided by means of a copper ~220! crystal diffracting\nclose to its Brewster\u2019s angle. The incident beam was 93%\nplane polarized and the energy resolution (DE\/E) of the\nmonochromator was 2 eV. All flight paths were evacuated to\nreduce the effects of absorption. The crystals were found to\ncleave naturally along the a-b plane, which resulted in the\nsamples forming platelets with the @001# direction normal to\nthe large surface. Due to the high absorption of the x rays,\nthe measurements were undertaken in reflection geometry,\nwhich in turn placed the requirement that the scattering was\nperformed with the @001# direction forming the on-axis di-\nrection.\nIII. RESULTS FROM x\u02dc0.5\nA. High-energy diffraction\nInitially measurements were undertaken on a sample of\nLa222xSr112xMn2O7 with x50.5, the same composition\npreviously studied by Chatterji et al.13 and Wakabashi\net al.14 After cooling the sample to 170 K, the temperature\ncorresponding to the maximum in intensity from the previ-\nous studies, a search for superlattice reflections from both the\nJahn-Teller order and charge order was undertaken.\nReflections of appreciable intensity were found, with the\nstrongest being situated around the ~1, 0, 5! Bragg reflection.\nSuperlattice reflections were found with a modulation wave\nvector of QW 5(20.25,20.25,0), which was consistent with\nthe superlattice reflections found by Chatterji et al.13 in their\nhigh-energy results. In addition, weaker superlattice reflec-\ntions were also located at a modulation wave vector of QW\n5(20.5,20.5,0), not reported in the study of Chatterji\net al.,13 but observed by Wakabayashi et al.14 We therefore\npropose that the reflections at QW 5(20.25,20.25,0) are, in\nfact, due to a Jahn-Teller ordering with the charge ordering\nreflections appearing at QW 5(20.5,20.5,0) consistent with\nthe model presented earlier and the work of Wakabayashi\net al. ~see Fig. 2!.\nA systematic study of the superlattice reflections ~0.75,\n20.25, 5!, the ~1, 1, 5! reflection in the Amam cell, and ~0.5,\n20.5, 5!, the ~0, 1, 5! reflection in the Amam cell, corre-\nsponding to the Jahn-Teller and charge order, respectively,\nwas undertaken. At 170 K, the peak intensities were mea-\nsured to be 34.23103 counts per second ~cps! for the Jahn-\nTeller ordering and 1.23103 cps for the charge ordering\nreflection. Upon cooling to 10 K, the superlattice reflec-\ntions were found not to disappear, but had decreased in in-\ntensity appreciably. The peak intensities at 10 K were 5.1\n3103 cps for the Jahn-Teller order and 147 cps for the\ncharge order.\nThe temperature dependence of the integrated intensity\nand width of the Jahn-Teller and charge order reflections\nwere measured upon warming from 10 K. Scans were taken\nalong the three principal directions in reciprocal space (H ,\nK, and L) in triple-axis geometry. Data in all three directions\nwere found to fit to a Lorentzian squared line shape. The\nresults of these are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for the Jahn-Teller\n~JT! order and charge order, respectively. The presence of the\nFIG. 3.

PHYSICAL REVIEW B 67, 205110 ~2003!\n205110-3\nsuperlattice reflections from both the charge order and Jahn-\nTeller order indicates that contrary to the assumption of\nWakabayashi et al.,14 the charge order is not reentrant but\nexists at low temperature in a weaker state. We shall now\nconsider the temperature dependence of the Jahn-Teller order\nupon warming from 10 K. Here it can be seen that upon\nwarming the integrated intensity starts to fall, reaching a\nminimum at a temperature of 70 K. However, even at this\ntemperature the reflection is easily observable, as indicated\nby the inset of Fig. 4, with a peak intensity of 1.57\n3103 cps, after subtraction of the background. Upon further\nwarming the integrated intensity stays constant until a tem-\nperature of 90 K, upon which the intensity starts to rapidly\ngrow, reaching a maximum at a temperature of 170 K. Fur-\nther warming causes the integrated intensity to fall again\nuntil it is not observable above background at a temperature\nof 225 K. The charge order reflection was found to display\nthe same trend, as indicated by Fig. 5.\nThe inverse correlation length j21 of the reflection was\ncalculated by the following equation:\njd\n215\n2p\nd w , ~1!\nwhere w is the half-width at half maximum of the reflection\nand d is the lattice parameter along the direction of the re-\nflection. Table I shows the inverse correlation length of the\nJahn-Teller order at temperatures of 10 K and 170 K. Here\nno significant difference can be seen in the inverse correla-\ntion length at the two temperatures. In addition, the charge\norder was not found to display any change in inverse corre-\nlation length over the whole temperature range.\nIV. RESULTS FROM x\u02dc0.475\nA. Mn K-edge resonant x-ray scattering\nThe sample was cooled to 180 K, similar to the case for\nthe x50.5 sample, and a search was carried out for satellite\nreflections corresponding to the Jahn-Teller, charge, and or-\nbital orders. Superlattice reflections were located at ~0.5, 0.5,\n10!, ~0.25, 0.25, 10!, and ~2.25, 20.25, 10!. By polarization\nanalysis of the scattered x-ray beam, the ~0.5, 0.5, 10! and\n~2.25, 20.25, 10! reflections were found to be primarily s8\npolarized ~i.e., no rotation of the plane of polarization!,\nwhereas the ~0.25, 0.25, 10! was found to be p8 polarized,\ncorresponding to a rotation of p\/2 of the plane of polariza-\ntion. The ~0.25, 0.25, 10! reflection was found only to have\nappreciable intensity in the vicinity of the manganese K\nedge.\nLet us first consider the case of the reflection located at\n~0.5, 0.5, 10!. Such a resonance occurs due to the asymmetry\nbetween the resonant scattering factors f 8(\\v) and f 9(\\v)\nfor the Mn31 and Mn41 species.

The parameter C comes from the contribution due to the\nnonresonant scattering @ f 0(\\v)# and scattering due to asym-\nmetry in the position of the oxygen ions. Due to the effects\nof chemical shift, the edge positions for the Mn31 and Mn41\nions will be altered, resulting in an increase in the contrast\nbetween the Mn31 and Mn41 ions between the energy of\neach absorption edge from the initial off-resonant difference\nof less than one electron. The resonance observed in Fig. 6 is\nconsistent with such a model, and it is thus attributed to be\ndue to the charge order. The resonance was observed to occur\nat the K-edge position of 6.556 keV as indicated by the fluo-\nrescence spectrum shown in the lower panel of Fig. 6 and the\npolarization was found to be unrotated.\nThe reflection at ~2.25, 20.25, 10!, of which the energy\ndependence is shown in Fig. 7, shows behavior that would be\nexpected from a structural modulation caused by the motion\nof the Mn41 species only ~see Fig. 2! as mentioned previ-\nously for the Jahn-Teller order. Such a dip in the intensity at\nthe absorption edge is due to the increased absorption post\nedge, which reduces the probed sample volume, in turn re-\nducing the signal.\nFinally, the reflection at ~0.25, 0.25, 10!, which behaved\ndifferently to the previous reflections was found to have a\nfinal polarization state rotated p\/2 from the incident beam, in\naddition to having only appreciable intensity at the K edge\n~see Fig. 8!. Similar results were found on the ~0.25,\n20.25, 10! position. This is consistent with the origin of the\nreflection being from the orbital order, caused by a splitting\nof the 4p energy levels from the ordering of the 3d orbitals.\nThe theory behind such a resonance has not clearly been\ndetermined, with two possible models. The first one has the\n4p states being split due to a hybridization of the\nMn(3d)-O(2p) and O(2p)-Mn(4p) states.18 Whilst the\nsecond one has the 4p states split due to Coulomb coupling\nbetween the 4p and 3d state,18 which will cause an increase\nin the 4p levels lying parallel to the extension of the 3d\norbital and reducing the energy perpendicular to such exten-\nsion. With resonant x-ray scattering at the K edge it is im-\npossible to separate the two models presented above, but\nboth are indicative of an orbital ordering process.\nB.

Triple-axis measure-\nments were carried out in the same manner described previ-\nously for the x50.5 sample.\nThe sample was cooled to 180 K, which corresponds to\nthe maximum in intensity observed in previous studies.\nStrong superlattice reflections were located around the the ~1,\n1, 0! Bragg peak with modulations of ~0.25, 20.25, 0! and\n~20.25, 0.25, 0!. Also present were weak reflections at\nmodulations of ~0.25, 0.25, 0! and ~20.25, 20.25, 0!. In\naddition, strong reflections were found with a modulation of\n~0.5, 20.5, 0! with weak reflections again at ~20.5, 0.5, 0!.\nWe attribute these to be due to the Jahn-Teller order and\ncharge order, respectively, in agreement with the resonant\nscattering data presented above. A systematic study was un-\ndertaken to observe peaks in the @100# \/ @010# plane of recip-\nrocal space. The results are shown in Fig. 9. Apparent from\nthis data is that strong reflections were seen only along the\n@11\u00af0# direction, with weaker reflections along the 90\u00b0 rotated\n@110# direction.\nAt 180 K, the ~1.75, 0.25, 0! superlattice reflection was\nmeasured along the three principal directions, H, K, and L.\nThe data were found to fit best to a Gaussian line shape\nalong the H direction, with the K and L directions displaying\na Lorentzian squared line shape. Fits to these data are shown\nin Fig. 10. The sample was then further cooled to ;10 K and\nthe intensity of the superlattice reflections corresponding to\nthe Jahn-Teller order were found to decrease, but were still\nobservable above background. Scans in H, K, and L were\nrepeated at this new temperature. Table II shows a compari-\nson of the inverse correlation lengths calculated using Eq.\n~1!, at 180 K and 10 K. There is a clear broadening in the\npeaks at low temperature, especially in the L direction; how-\never, along the H direction the broadening is not as apparent.\nThe Jahn-Teller ordering superlattice reflection was stud-\nied as a function of temperature from 10 K. Fig. 11 shows\nthe integrated intensity, wave vector, and inverse correlation\nlength over the temperature region 10\u2013240 K. For the inte-\ngrated intensity, we can see from the top panel of Fig. 11 that\nthe intensity of the Jahn-Teller distortion stays constant until\n100 K, at which point it starts to increase. A maximum is\nreached at 180 K, at which point the integrated intensity has\nincreased by a factor of ;6. Upon further warming, the in-\ntegrated intensity starts to decrease until 220 K, where the\npeak was barely observable above background. We now turn\nto the inverse correlation length, displayed in the bottom\npanel of Fig. 11. In this case the inverse correlation length\nstays constant until ;100 K, at which point it starts to fall,\nindicating an increase in correlation until the temperature\nagain reaches 220 K, where the inverse correlation length\nstarts to increase. From these data it is possible to see that\nthere exist three main temperature regions. In the range\n10 K<T<140 K ~region I in Fig. 11! the Jahn-Teller order\nexists in a low-intensity, less correlated region than in the\nregion 140 K,T<210 K ~region II in Fig. 11!, where the\nJahn-Teller distortion is large, which is more correlated than\nat low temperature. Above 220 K ~region III! there is no\ndetectable Jahn-Teller order. The integrated intensity is pro-\nportional to the amplitude squared of the electron density, the\nsuperlattice reflections arise due to the movement of the\nMn41 ions and the displacement of the oxygen ions due to\nthe elongation of the Mn-O bonds caused by the Jahn-Teller\neffect; and therefore as the Mn-O bond length increases, the\nMn41 ions will be further moved, causing an increase in the\nasymmetry of the electron density. This will, in turn, cause\nan increase in the integrated intensity. We can therefore con-\nclude that in region I the magnitude of the Jahn-Teller dis-\ntortions ~i.e., the Mn-O bond length! is less than in region II.\nIn addition, in region I the correlation of the cooperative\nordering of the Mn-O bond length elongation is less than in\nregion II. An alternative explanation for the nature of the\nreentrant charge behavior is a movement of the holes as a\nFIG. 9.

At high temperatures ~region II!, the\nholes are believed to reside at the positions of the manganese\nions. At low temperatures a movement of the holes towards\nthe oxygen positions would cause a reduction in the Mn41\nJahn-Teller displacements, and thus a reduction in the scat-\ntered intensity. Physically, this corresponds to a shift of the\neg electron density ~localized at the Mn31 sites! towards the\noxygen sites, and thus delocalized between Mn pairs.\nIn addition to the integrated intensity and inverse correla-\ntion length, the wave vector ~position! was measured along\nthe ^100& direction as a function of temperature, the results of\nwhich are displayed in the central panel of Fig. 11. Here we\ncan see that in region I the Jahn-Teller order exists at an\nincommensurate value, but, upon warming at the boundary\ninto region II, the wave vector locks into a commensurate\nvalue of 1.75. The incommensurability corresponds to a\nvalue \u00ab50.004 r.l.u., which suggests a long period modula-\ntion of the Jahn-Teller distortion. No change in position of\nthe wave vector along the K or L direction was observed, due\nto the larger peak width in these directions. Charge ordering\nin the 3D perovskites such as Pr0.5CaxSr0.52xMnO3 develops\nby particular steps, suggesting that the observed incommen-\nsurability is caused by quasiperiodic defects, that is, discom-\nmensurations.19 However, the very small value of the incom-\nmensurability would suggest such discommensurations\nwould be separated by lengths approaching the domain size,\nhence such deviations could be due to an effect of domain\nboundaries. Previous studies by Radaelli et al.20 using pow-\nder neutron diffraction on samples of La12xCaxMnO3 have\nalso observed an incommensurability of the Jahn-Teller or-\nder, however, no \u2018\u2018lock-in\u2019\u2019 behavior was reported.\nSimilar measurements were also carried out on the charge\norder. No charge order was detectable at 10 K, in contrast to\nthe x50.5 sample. However, at 120 K, superlattice reflec-\ntions were visible above the background and the temperature\ndependence in the region 120\u2013210 K of the ~1.5, 0.5, 0!\ncharge order reflection was studied, with the results being\nshown in Fig. 12. At the maximum in intensity at 180 K, the\ncharge order was found to be ;50 times weaker than the\ncorresponding Jahn-Teller order. This is the first observation\nof charge ordering reflections for any composition other than\nx50.5. Previous synchrotron x-ray and neutron-powder-\ndiffraction studies did not observe charge ordering except for\nx50.5.21\nWithin this temperature range the charge order is found to\ndisplay the same variation as the Jahn-Teller order with tem-\nperature, maximizing at the same temperature of 180 K.

No variation\nwith temperature was observed over the whole range studied\nalong the H and K directions. However, along the L direction\na distinct variation was observed. Figure 13 shows the in-\nverse correlation length as a function of temperature. Here a\nbroadening at low temperature is apparent, which indicates\nthat at low temperature the charge ordering is becoming\nmore two dimensional in nature.\nThe absence of the charge order reflection at 10 K, in\ncontrast to the x50.5 sample, does not suggest that the x\n50.475 sample is not charge ordered. The presence of Jahn-\nTeller order at the modulation wave vector QW 5~0.25, 0.25,0!\nrelies upon the model of a \u2018\u2018checkerboard- like\u2019\u2019 charge or-\ndering as displayed schematically in Fig. 2. In the absence of\nany charge ordering, the Jahn-Teller ordering would not ap-\npear at this wave vector. Therefore we propose that the x\n50.475 sample is charge ordered at low temperatures, but it\nis not of sufficient intensity to observe above the experimen-\ntal background.\nFinally, we carried out high-resolution measurements on\nthe Bragg peaks at station 16.3 at the SRS, Daresbury Labo-\nratory, UK, with an incident wavelength of 1 \u00c5. A silicon\n~111! analyzer was used to provide high-resolution measure-\nments. The temperature dependence of the wave vector ~po-\nsition!, width, and intensity of the Bragg peaks was collected\non the same sample as studied with the high-energy experi-\nments for the ~1, 21, 16! Bragg reflection. No significant\nchange in wave vector or integrated intensity was observed\nin any of the principal reciprocal space directions over the\ntemperature range 10 K<T<300 K. However, a clear in-\ncrease in the inverse correlation length along the L direction\ncan be seen, in agreement with Wakabayashi et al.14 These\ndata are shown in Fig. 14.\nWe propose that the increase in inverse correlation length\noccurs due to the presence of charge and Jahn-Teller order,\nwhich causes strains within the lattice, the maximum of the\nstrain coincides with the temperature of the maximum Jahn\u2013\nTeller distortion.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have used high-energy x-ray scattering\nalong with resonant x-ray scattering to investigate the Jahn-\nTeller, charge, and orbital order in the bilayer manganite\nLa222xSr112xMn2O7 with x50.5 and 0.475.\nThese studies have confirmed the correct modulation\nwave vector for the charge, orbital, and Jahn-Teller order as\nQW CO5~0.5, 0.5, 0!, QW OO5~0.25, 0.25, 0!, and QW J2T5~0.25,\n0.25, 0!, respectively. This is in agreement with the resonant\nx-ray scattering studies of Wakabayashi et al.,14 but is in\ncontrast with the results of Chatterji et al. We propose that\nthe charge order reflections measured by Chatterji et al. are,\nin fact, due to cooperative Jahn-Teller order. The resonant\nscattering data presented here using polarization analysis on\nthe x50.475 sample confirms the origin of the scattering at\neach of these wave vectors.\nWork previous to this report had suggested that the charge\nand orbitally ordered state is reentrant in behavior. However,\nthe results here on both the x50.5 and x50.475 show that\nthe ordered state exists down to the lowest temperature of\nthese measurements, ;10 K. In fact, the previous transition\n~whereby the ordered state was seen to disappear!, is, in fact,\nonly a reduction in intensity of the ordering, with an addi-\ntional reduction in correlation in the x50.475 sample.\nThere are clear differences between the ordered states in\nthe x50.5 and x50.475 systems. First, in the x50.5 sample\nthe correlation of the Jahn-Teller and charge ordering, indi-\ncated by the inverse correlation lengths, does not change\nover the whole temperature range, at which there is sufficient\nintensity to observe the superlattice reflection. However, in\nthe x50.475 sample there are three clear temperature re-\ngions; at high temperatures there is no Jahn-Teller order, the\nsecond one occurs at moderately high temperatures where\nthe Jahn-Teller order and charge order are highly correlated\nand intense, and third at lower temperatures where the Jahn-\nTeller order is weak and less correlated than at higher tem-\nperatures. In addition, the temperature variation along the L\ndirection for the charge order suggests that at low tempera-\nture the charge order is becoming more two-dimensional-\nlike. The presence of Jahn-Teller order indicates that the\ncharge order is still present. In the low-temperature region of\nthe x50.475 sample, the Jahn-Teller order is found to be\nincommensurate with a transition at 140 K into a commen-\nsurate phase. Such a lock-in behavior of the Jahn-Teller order\nFIG. 13.

Unlike the x50.475\nsample, the intensity of the Jahn-Teller and charge order in\nthe x50.5 sample is found to be greater at 10 K than at 70 K.\nUpon warming, a reduction in intensity before the dramatic\nincrease into the higher temperature region is observed. Such\nbehavior has been recently theoretically predicted through\npolaron bandwidth calculations by Yuan and Thalmeier.22\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Steve Collins of the SRS,\nCLRC Daresbury Laboratory, UK, for his assistance during\nthe measurements at station 16.3.
