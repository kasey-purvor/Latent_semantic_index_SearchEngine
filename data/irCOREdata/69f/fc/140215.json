INTRODUCTION\nThere has been intense interest within the HRM field regarding how HRM can add value to\norganizations, leading to an increasing focus on high performance work systems (HPWS)\n(Macky and Boxall, 2007). At the same time, commentators have increasingly argued the\nneed to revise existing research to address some of the inherent methodological weaknesses in\nthe field (Guest, 1997; Wood, 1999). One issue is that many models of HRM and firm\nperformance are based on theoretical assumptions about the outcomes of certain HRM\npractices, rather than on empirical observation (Paauwe and Farndale, 2005: 97). Guest (1999)\nalso argues for more attention to be paid to the employee perspective in this debate, alongside\nthe more common organizational level variables.\nConceptual models have started to explore the links between HRM practices and HRM\noutcomes. HRM practices can take three different forms: intended, actual and perceived\n(Wright and Nishii, 2004). Intended HRM includes the policies and practices put together at\norganization level. These practices are then enacted by line management in the process of\nimplementation, and may or may not be carried out as originally intended. The employee is\nultimately the recipient of these practices, forming his or her own perceptions of them. These\nperceptions then influence employee-level outcomes by affecting the way the employee\nthinks, feels or behaves (Purcell et al., 2003). This debate is often referred to as \u2018opening the\nblack box\u2019 between HRM and performance (Guest, 1997; Purcell et al., 2003).\nOne dimension of the HRM\/performance debate focuses on the notion that practices can be\ndesigned to create a particular HRM outcome, in this case high commitment \u2013 so called high\ncommitment work practices (HCWP). Commitment is seen as a fundamental requirement to\nachieve such desirable outcomes as higher job satisfaction and lower absenteeism (Mathieu\nand Zajac, 1990), higher organization citizenship behaviour and employees who are willing to\n\u2018go the extra mile\u2019 (Organ, 1990). We focus here on a sub-system of practices within HCWPs:\nhigh commitment performance management (HCPM). HCPM includes performance\nmanagement practices which are designed to engender commitment from employees through\ninvolvement and personal development, such as regular appraisal feedback, input into the\nprocess of target setting, choosing pay and benefit options, and appraisals leading to\ndevelopment opportunities and new targets. HCPM is argued to affect an employee\u2019s\nperceptions of organizational actions, which leads to related employee attitudes and\nbehaviours (Den Hartog et al., 2004). We need, however, to look deeper into how this process\nworks. The approach adopted here is to consider how the extant organizational climate affects\nemployee reactions using theories of organizational justice and trust.\nWe present the argument that for performance management practices to have the effect of\nachieving high commitment, this depends on the extent to which employees perceive these\npractices to be fair, both in terms of the process and the outcomes. Organizational justice is\nproposed to play a key mediating role in this relationship, and has been found to explain a\nwide range of employee behaviours (Greenberg, 1990).\nIn addition, the broader macro-environment of the organizational context creates the\nconditions under which the employee-employer relationship is formed (Den Hartog et al.,\n2004). This affects how employees perceive performance management practices and again\ninfluences the related behaviour and attitudes. Particularly, the extent of trust that employees\nhave in the organization as represented by senior management is an important aspect of\norganizational climate (McAllister, 1995; Macky and Boxall, 2007). Trust, it is argued here,\n4moderates the extent to which performance management practices can lead to perceptions of\njustice and employee commitment.\nIn summary, this study explores the effect of employee perceptions of the fairness of\nperformance management practices on organizational commitment and the impact of trust in\nsenior management on this relationship. The related issues of commitment, perceived\ndistributive, procedural, and interactional justice and organizational trust are first discussed. A\nmodel of HCPM and its relationship with these variables is then constructed based on extant\ntheory and tested in an empirical study to explore its applicability to theory and practice.\n2. HIGH COMMITMENT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT\nEmployee commitment denotes a belief in and acceptance of the goals and values of an\norganization, a willingness to exert effort on behalf of the organization, and a strong desire to\nmaintain membership of the organization (Mowday, et al. 1979). This HRM outcome has a\nstrong relationship with organizational success factors such as higher job satisfaction, lower\nabsenteeism and organization citizenship behaviour (e.g. Mathieu and Zajac, 1990; Organ,\n1990). It has thus been argued that individuals with high levels of commitment are more\nwilling to devote greater efforts towards an organization\u2019s goals and objectives (Guest, 1987).\nIn order to support a desire for high commitment, certain HRM practices can therefore be put\nin place in organizations.\nThe term \u2018high commitment\u2019 is frequently used (incorrectly) interchangeably with terms like\n\u2018high involvement\u2019 and \u2018high performance\u2019, the former being more prominent in the UK and\nthe latter two in the US literature (Gould-Williams, 2004). The tendency in the \u2018high\nperformance\u2019 literature is to identify a set of HRM best practices which together will improve\nfirm performance (Guest, 1987; Whitener, 2001; Wood & de Menezes, 1998). However, the\nvariety of practices included in these different studies has led to confusion over which HRM\npractices should be regarded as \u2018high performance\u2019. More recently, Boxall and Macky (2009)\nhave highlighted that high involvement and high commitment work practices are not\nsynonymous: although high involvement work practices tend to engender high commitment,\nthe reverse is not necessarily the case. For example, practices which enhance empowerment\nhave been found to have a significant effect on employee commitment (Gardner et al., 2001).\nHowever, there are many studies which show that employee commitment can be achieved by\nroutes other than those incorporating high involvement, such as pay and job security (Boxall\n& Macky, 2009).\nLike the \u2018high involvement\u2019 literature, the \u2018high commitment\u2019 literature focuses on desired\noutcomes more than on practices themselves (Wood & de Menezes, 1998). In general, studies\nof high involvement or high commitment work practices have a clearer definition of the\ndesired outcome (involvement or commitment) compared to the more generic high\nperformance literature in which \u2018performance\u2019 can have many interpretations (Boxall &\nMacky, 2009). High commitment HRM is about shaping employee behaviours and attitudes\nby developing psychological links between organizational and individual goals to increase\neffectiveness and productivity (Arthur, 1994). Correspondingly, the practices that represent a\nhigh commitment strategy include any sets of HRM policies and procedures that affect\nemployee commitment (Whitener, 2001).\nFocusing in particular on the performance management dimensions of HCWPs, these\npractices are recognized as increasingly central to high performing organizations.\n5Performance management itself is \u201can integrated process in which managers work with their\nemployees to set expectations, measure and review results, and reward performance, in order\nto improve employee performance, with the ultimate aim of positively affecting\norganizational success\u201d (Den Hartog et al., 2004: 557). The primary aim is to provide\nguidance to employees on how to apply their resources for the benefit of the organization\n(Gardener et al., 2001). Performance management practices represent an important element in\nthe HRM process and have particular significance for notions of high commitment (Fletcher\nand Williams, 1996), although as yet evidence of a direct linkage is weak (Guest et al., 2003).\nWe argue here that there are two types of commitment-enhancing performance management\npractices. The first, as noted above, has a high involvement focus and includes personal\ninvolvement in setting objectives, having frequent opportunities to discuss performance and\nreceive feedback, and having some choice over the pay and benefits received. In return for\nthese organizational practices, the employee reciprocates with higher commitment to the\norganization in line with social exchange theory (Blau, 1964). The second type focuses on\nemployees feeling they have opportunities to develop, with the reciprocal repayment of this\ninvestment again in terms of commitment and a lower intention to leave. Such practices\ninclude appraisal discussions which result in training and development opportunities and new\nchallenges being set for the employee to work towards. Combined, we refer to these practices\nfurther as High Commitment Performance Management (HCPM): a sub-system of practices\nwithin HCWPs focusing on the three dimensions of performance management (appraisal,\ntarget setting and reward).\nThese HCPM practices effectively represent an intersection of the organization\u2019s and\nindividual\u2019s interests, and are fully facilitated by line managers and supervisors. Outcomes of\nthese processes are generally explicit and consequently may provide a focus for employees\u2019\nassessment of the organization. Equally, decisions about performance are in many\norganizations frequent, regular occurrences and so capturing employee perceptions in relation\nto them may be more realisable than for other HRM activities. Therefore, the first hypothesis\nis presented as follows:\nH1: The more employees are the recipients of HCPM practices, the higher their level of\ncommitment.\nIt has been suggested that there is a need to understand the broader organizational context in\nwhich performance management occurs to understand its outcomes (Den Hartog et al., 2004).\nOrganizational context is explored here further in terms of the extant organizational climate,\nincluding employee perceptions of justice in HCPM practices, and their levels of\norganizational trust.\n3. THE ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE\nIn studying the outcomes of HCPM, it is interesting to explore not only what practices are\nimplemented, but also how they are experienced by employees (Gratton and Truss, 2003).\nGuest (1999) argues that the way in which employees perceive and evaluate HRM practices\nimpacts employee behaviour and attitudes. Employee perceptions of performance\nmanagement practices are thus of crucial importance (Purcell et al., 2003; Wright and Nishii,\n2004), and can be explained with the help of organizational justice theories. Organizational\njustice can explain a wide range of employee behaviours and highlights the importance of the\n6ideals of justice and fairness as a requirement for organizations to function effectively\n(Greenberg, 1990).\nThe two most prevalent forms of organizational justice discussed in the literature are\ndistributive and procedural justice (Folger and Konovsky, 1989; Greenberg, 1990).\nDistributive justice refers to the perceived equity of outcomes for individuals, for example,\nwhether the performance appraisal process results in what the individual perceives to be a fair\nevaluation. Procedural justice refers to the individual\u2019s perception of the fairness of the\nprocess carried out, for example, to reach a final performance grading. An employee is said to\nbe more likely to find the outcomes of HRM practices fair, if the process of those practices is\nperceived to be equitable (Folger and Konovsky, 1989). A process which allows employee\ninvolvement is also often perceived as being more fair (Greenberg, 1990). For example, if an\nemployee is able to input into the process of setting targets, he or she is more likely to\nperceive those targets as fair.\nExtant research shows that perceptions of procedural justice in HRM are related in particular\nto measures such as trust in management, job satisfaction and employee commitment (Folger\nand Konovsky, 1989; McFarlin and Sweeney, 1992). Distributive justice on the other hand is\nmore closely related to outcome satisfaction, such as fairness of levels of pay and\nperformance evaluations (Folger and Konovsky, 1989; Greenberg, 1990). Procedural justice\nis therefore a stronger predictor of evaluations of an organization as an institution, whereas\ndistributive justice relates more closely to specific personal outcomes (McFarlin and\nSweeney, 1992).\nThere is some debate in the literature regarding the extent to which distributive and\nprocedural justice can actually be measured independently. However, Greenberg (1990)\npresents an overview of studies which have identified measures of distributive and procedural\njustice which are statistically independent, and show that employees are intuitively aware of\nthe distinction, supporting the idea that these are separate, though related measures of\norganizational justice.\nThere is also a third type of organizational justice: interactional justice. This is argued to be a\nsubset of procedural justice (Cropanzano et al., 2002), and is described as the interpersonal\naspects of procedural justice (Greenberg, 1990). Whereas procedural justice focuses on the\nfairness of procedures relating an employee to an organization, interactional justice focuses on\nthe interpersonal treatment employees receive from their managers during these procedures\n(Chang, 2005).\nOrganizational justice can thus help explain employee attitudes and behaviour, triggering\nemployee commitment in organizations (Folger and Konovsky, 1989; McFarlin and Sweeney,\n1992; Organ, 1990; Purcell et al., 2003). This leads to the following hypotheses:\nH2a: The more employees are the recipients of HCPM practices, the more positive their\nperceptions of the justice of these practices.\nH2b: More positive perceptions of the justice of HCPM practices are associated with\nhigher levels of employee commitment.\nAs justice perceptions are expected to be strongly related to employee commitment (cf.\nGreenberg, 1990), we also anticipate a mediating effect of justice between experiences of\nHCPM and commitment:\n7H2c: Employee perceptions of the justice of HCPM practices will mediate the relationship\nbetween the experienced HCPM practices and employee commitment.\n4. ORGANIZATIONAL TRUST\nIn addition to the mediating role of organizational justice in the relationship between\nperformance management practices and commitment, extant literature also shows that trust\ncreates conditions which affect employee responses to HRM practices, including commitment\n(McAllister, 1995; Macky and Boxall, 2007).\nThere are many definitions of trust, as well as multiple types of trust which have differing\neffects on organizational behaviour (McAllister, 1995). A common organizational definition\ndescribes trust as: \u201ca psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability\nbased upon positive expectations of the intentions or behaviours of another\u201d (Rousseau et al.,\n1998: 395). Trust can be looked at from both the micro (an employee\u2019s job and line manager)\nand the macro perspective (their employer\/senior management) (Ayree, et al., 2002). In order\nto understand the broader organizational context in which HRM practices are carried out and\nhow employee perceptions of justice are formed, it is important to consider this macro-\nenvironment. Costigan et al. (1998) claim that employee trust in senior management is (ibid:\n304): \u201cbased on the outcomes of organizational decisions made by these top managers and\nless on direct experience of their character, words and actions.\u201d Therefore employee trust in\nsenior management is interpreted through the company\u2019s policies and practices, in this case\nperformance management practices.\nLike organizational justice, trust has also been shown to lead to higher levels of organizational\ncommitment (McAllister, 1995). For example, negative feedback from a trusted manager is\nlikely to be considered as accurate by an employee, and they will try to improve their\nperformance. Yet an employee is likely to doubt the accuracy of negative feedback from a\nmanager who is not trusted, and will not attempt to improve their performance (Dirks and\nFerrin, 2001).\nTrust is thus not only an end in itself: it facilitates the effects of other determinants on desired\noutcomes such as commitment, cooperation, acceptance of decisions and higher performance,\nbut in this sense it remains an undeveloped area of research. Dirks and Ferrin (2001: 451)\nacknowledge that there is empirical evidence that trust has a main effect, but also develop a\ntheoretical argument that trust \u201cmoderates the relationship between an interaction partner\u2019s\naction and the trustee\u2019s response by influencing one\u2019s interpretation of the action\u201d. Levels of\nemployee trust in their employer\/senior management can therefore be seen as impacting the\nlink between employee experiences of HCPM practices, and their related behavioural and\nattitudinal outcomes in terms of commitment and perceptions of justice. This leads to the final\nhypotheses for empirical investigation:\nH3a: Higher levels of trust in employer\/senior management are associated with higher\nlevels of employee commitment.\nH3b: Employee levels of trust in their employer\/senior management will moderate the\nrelationship between experienced HCPM practices and employee commitment.\nH4a: Higher levels of trust in employer\/senior management are associated with higher\nlevels of perceived organizational justice.\n8H4b: Employee levels of trust in their employer\/senior management will moderate the\nrelationship between experienced HCPM practices and organizational justice\nperceptions.\nIn summary, our exploration of the extant literature to identify the relationships between\nHCPM practices and employee commitment has considered both a direct and indirect\nrelationship between input factors and outcomes. In order to explore these relationships\nfurther, we present these in a model in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Research model\nMETHODOLOGY\nTo test the hypotheses, four large organizations in the UK were surveyed in 2004\/5. For the\npurpose of corporate anonymity, the organizations are referred to here as Finance,\nAutomotive, Foodstuff, and Communications, representing the sectors to which they belong.\nQuestionnaires were distributed by internal post either to the full population of smaller\nbusiness units, or a sample was selected by the organization based on selection of the nth\nemployee on a non-stratified alphabetical listing (e.g. reducing a population of 800 to a\nsample of 200 participants). This was done in order to ensure in total a maximum of 200\nrespondents per organization to avoid over-dominance in the dataset of a single organization.\nQuestionnaires were completed and returned anonymously direct to the researchers. The\naverage response rate was 63%. In total, 524 responses were received from the four\norganizations. The profile of respondents is presented in Table 1. Although Finance and\nCommunication compose the larger share of the sample, the cases were not weighted in order\nto maintain the reliability of the original data.\nDistributive justice\nProcedural justice\nInteractional justice\nTrust in employer\/\nsenior\nmanagement\nEmployee\ncommitment\nHigh commitment\nperformance\nmanagement\npractices\nH1\nH2bH2a\nH4a\nH3b\nH3a\nH2c\nH4b\n9Table 1: Respondent profile\nOrganization (n= 524) %\nFinance 37\nAutomotive 16\nFoodstuff 16\nCommunication 31\nGrade (n= 519)\nSenior management 9\nManagement 34\nProfessional 16\nAdministrative 41\nGender (n=521 )\nMale 47\nFemale 53\nAge (n=523 )\nUnder 20 1\n20-29 23\n30-39 29\n40-49 25\n50 or over 23\nTenure (n=524 )\nLess than 5 years 33\n6-15 years 32\n16-25 years 20\nMore than 25 years 14\nMeasures\nFirstly, six items were included regarding the HCPM practices as experienced by employees,\nincluding: appraisal frequency, outcomes of appraisal (training opportunities, targets), extent\nof personal involvement in target setting, and personal choice over pay and benefits. For the\nremaining variables, new scales were developed based on existing work and were all\nmeasured using a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree). An\nalpha factor analysis resulted in 7 factors covering justice, trust and commitment, which\ntogether account for 61% of variance:\n\uf0b7 Distributive justice was measured using eight items, including validated items from the\nPrice and Mueller (1986) Distributive Justice Index: \u2018fair considering effort\u2019 and \u2018fair\nconsidering responsibilities\u2019. Two dimensions of distributive justice emerged in the factor\nanalysis: distributive justice in appraisal and objective setting (Cronbach \u03b1 = .89) and\ndistributive justice in reward practices (Cronbach \u03b1 = .84).\n\uf0b7 The procedural justice measure, which included 9 items, was based on Folger and\nKonovsky (1989), but adapted specifically for questions regarding performance\nmanagement. The Cronbach \u03b1 for this scale was .91. (Note: Three items, those pertaining\nto procedural justice in reward practices, loaded highly (and with similar values) onto two\nfactors: interactional justice in reward, and procedural justice in appraisal and objective\nsetting. It was decided to group these three items with the other procedural justice items\nfor the purpose of clarity in the results.)\n\uf0b7 Interactional justice considered whether the employee feels he\/she has been treated with\ndignity, sensitivity and consideration, and the quality of information used to reach\ndecisions on performance, drawing upon the work by Bies and Moag (1986) and Skarlicki\net al. (1999). In the factor analysis, two separate dimensions of interactional justice\n10\nemerged from the six item scale: interactional justice in appraisal and objective setting\n(Cronbach \u03b1 = .93) and interactional justice in reward practices (Cronbach \u03b1 = .93);\n\uf0b7 Based on work by Cook and Wall (1980) and Gabarro & Athos (1976), the measure for\ntrust in employer\/senior management asked for employee perceptions of the sincerity,\nequity and integrity of senior management. Eight items were included. The trust in\nemployer\/senior management scale had a Cronbach \u03b1 of .90.\n\uf0b7 Employee commitment was measured using seven items from the 15-item Organizational\nCommitment Questionnaire (Mowday, et al., 1979). The scale was found to be reliable\n(Cronbach \u03b1 = .83).\nThe data was controlled for the impact of structural and demographic variables: organization,\nage, tenure, and job grade. Although significant differences were found in a number of\nvariables based on these divisions, the data has not been weighted as within the organizations\nthe respondents were found to be representative of the populations. However, it is\nacknowledged that such demographic variables do account for some of the variance in the\noutcomes measured (see, for example: McFarlin and Sweeney, 1992). Age was measured\nbased on five groups in ten year intervals from under 20 to over 50. Tenure was based on four\ngroups in five year intervals from under 5 to over 25 years of service. Job grading was worded\nspecifically for each company so that it would be meaningful to the respondent. With the help\nof an HR representative in each company, these specific job grades were mapped onto five\ngeneral levels of job grade for comparability purposes (ranging from manual worker to senior\nmanagement).\nTable 2 shows the descriptive statistics for all variables. A number of correlations between\nvariables are significant, with the highest being between procedural justice in performance\nmanagement and interactional justice in appraisal and objective setting (.649). This might be\nexpected given the theoretical discussion of the interrelatedness of these two concepts.\nEqually, there is a high correlation (.639) between age and length of service, which again\nmight be expected. However, none of the correlations exceed .700: this, along with the prior\nresearch discussed above, indicates that the factors are sufficiently different measures of\nseparate variables. Harman's single factor test was performed to test for the presence of\ncommon method variance bias (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986). All variables were entered into a\nprincipal components analysis with varimax rotation. The results of the analysis indicated\neight factors with eigenvalues greater than one, and no single factor accounted for more than\n33.1% of the covariation. The results indicate that common method variance is not expected\nto affect the results.\n11\nTable 2: Mean, standard deviation, Spearman correlations and reliability\nM SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n1.

To test this relationship further, a single HCPM practices score was\ncalculated by summing the component parts; this new variable also shows a significant\nrelationship with commitment (Table 3, column 3). Therefore the direct link between\nexperienced performance management practices and employee commitment is confirmed.\nHypothesis 2 suggests (a) employee experiences of HCPM are related to their perceptions of\norganizational justice; (b) there is a positive direct relationship between perceived\norganizational justice and employee commitment; and (c) this will mediate the relationship\nbetween experienced HCPM practices and commitment levels. Firstly, the results of H2a are\nshown in column 4, Table 3. In order to calculate a single organizational justice dependent\nvariable, the mean score across the five dimensions of organizational justice was calculated.\nFour of the five HCPM practices are shown to have a significant relationship with perceived\norganizational justice, explaining 24% of variance with the control variables included. These\nresults show that perceptions of justice of HCPM practices improve particularly the more\nfrequently employees experience appraisal, the more involved they are in setting their own\ntargets, and the more frequently appraisal discussions result in development opportunities and\nnew targets being set. As above, the test was also rerun using the single HCPM variable\nincluding all five elements; this combined variable again shows a significant relationship with\norganizational justice (Table 3, column 5).\nSecondly, looking at column 6 (H2b) in Table 3, distributive justice in appraisal, objective\nsetting and reward, and interactional justice in appraisal and objective setting have a\nsignificant positive effect on employee commitment. Only employee perceptions of\ninteractional justice in reward do not affect their level of commitment to the organization.\nExploring the mediating effect of justice, column 7 (H2c) of Table 3 shows that the addition\nof organizational justice to the equation has increased the variance explained from 23% to\n33%, and the performance management practices are no longer significant at the p<.05 level,\nindicating a full mediation relationship. In other words, in addition to the actual presence of\nHCPM practices, these practices must be perceived to be fair in order for their full effect on\ncommitment levels to be observed.\nHypothesis 3 introduces the notion of the importance of trust in the employer\/senior\nmanagement as an additional contextual variable which may help explain levels of\ncommitment. Firstly, the relationship between trust and employee commitment was explored.\nBased on ANOVA analyses, column 1 (H3a) of Table 4 shows that trust is very strongly and\npositively related to employee commitment. Secondly, to explore hypothesis 3b, the single\nsummed experienced HCPM practices variable was used. When looking at the role of trust as\na moderator of the HCPM practices \u2013 employee commitment relationship, Table 4, column 2\n(H3b) shows the positive significant interaction effect of HCPM practices and trust in\nemployer. Support is thus found for both hypotheses: the level of trust an employee has in the\nemployer effects the extent to which HCPM practices are linked with higher commitment.\nAlthough the variance in organizational justice explained (R2) increases from 47% to 53%,\nthere is a decrease in the adjusted R2 figure (from 42% to 36%). Given that adjusted R2\ncorrects for the number of variables in the model, this implies the new model (H3b) is less\nefficient in its ability to predict organizational justice than the previous model (H3a).\n15\nTable 4: Factorial ANOVA results\nEmployee commitment Organizational justice\nH3a H3b H4a H4b\nF df F df F df F df\nOrganization 10.904** 1 10.258** 1 4.842* 1 3.352\uf085 1\nJob grade 1.393 1 .451 1 4.123* 1 3.578\uf085 1\nAge 10.506** 1 12.694**\n* 1\n2.105 1\n.140 1\nTenure .039 1 .111 1 .296 1 .299 1\nHCPM\nTrust in employer 8.398*** 39 6.081*** 40\nHCPM x Trust in employer 2.594*** 124 2.962*** 126\nR2 .466 .529 .385 .549\nAdjusted R2 .417 .358 .328 .382\nN 514 480 515 482\n\uf085 p < .10, * p < .05, ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001.\nHypothesis 4a explores the relationship between trust and organizational justice. Table 4,\ncolumn 3 (H4a) shows that there is a positive significant relationship between trust and justice\nperceptions with the control variables included. Hypotheses 4b then explores the moderating\nrole of trust in the relationship between experienced HCPM practices and perceived\norganizational justice. Again Table 4, column 4 (H4b), shows a strong positive effect. This\nshows how trust in the employer plays a significant moderating role in the relationship\nbetween HCPM practices and employee perceptions of organization justice: the more trust,\nthe higher the chance employees will consider the HCPM practices to be fair.\n6. DISCUSSION\nThis paper set out to look at the relationship between employee perceptions of HCPM\npractices and their commitment to the organization. In addition, the study was designed to\nexplore the mechanisms by which these perceptions influence particular employee attitudes\nand behaviours, and the effect of the broader organization context on how this mechanism\nworks.\nAll the hypotheses received some support. There is a strong positive relationship between\nemployee experiences of HCPM practices and perceptions of justice, and between perceived\nlevels of justice and employee commitment, which is in line with previous studies (Folger and\nKonovsky, 1989; Greenberg, 1990; McFarlin and Sweeney, 1992). The link between HCPM\npractices and commitment is fully mediated by perceptions of organizational justice,\nespecially distributive and interactional justice. This supports the notion of the importance of\njustice in explaining employee attitudes and behaviours (cf. Greenberg, 1990). Looking at the\nrole of employee trust in the organization, this is found to moderate the relationship between\nHCPM and perceptions of justice, and between HCPM and levels of commitment. The\ntheoretical argument presented by Dirks and Ferrin (2001: 463) that trust moderates the\nrelationship between an interaction partner\u2019s action and the trustee\u2019s response has thus been\ntested here and found to be supported by the empirical data.\n16\nThus the main findings to emerge from the study are threefold. Firstly, at a theoretical level,\nthe study contributes to the growing literature on how HRM practices and their impact as\nperceived by employees result in HRM outcomes (cf. Guest, 1997; Purcell et al., 2003). In\nparticular, the findings explain some of the \u2018black box\u2019 workings: HCPM practices achieve\ntheir aim of higher commitment provided these practices are perceived to be fair, which in\nturn is facilitated by high levels of trust in the organization (cf. Dirks and Ferrin, 2001).\nHCWPs should thus include performance management elements which allow employee\ninvolvement (cf. Gardener et al., 2001) and opportunities for development, but they also need\nto be built on processes and interactions that are considered fair by employees.\nThe second main contribution of the study is a further definition of the variables which\nconstitute organizational justice. Based on previous research, we would expect to see the\nstrongest relationship to be observed between procedural justice and employee commitment\n(cf. Folger and Konovsky, 1989; McFarlin and Sweeney, 1992). Distributive justice in\ncontrast has previously been most likely to be related to personal satisfaction outcomes, rather\nthan broader organization assessments such as commitment (cf. McFarlin and Sweeney,\n1992). The study however shows that perceptions of the distributive justice of HCPM\npractices have the strongest impact on employee commitment. This may be specific to the\norganizations selected, as they were all undergoing major change programmes. Further\nresearch is required in this area to uncover whether in times of change, or other significant\norganizational events, distributive justice takes on a different priority for employees. Indeed,\nit is acknowledged that little is known about the differential effects of various aspects of\norganizational change on different aspects of the attitudes of those individuals affected by the\nchange, such as levels of commitment (Fedor et al., 2006).\nThe significant effect of organization observed in the results may also indicate that the\nfindings are specific to a particular context. To explore this further, the research models were\ntested in each of the four separate company datasets (see Appendix). The results indicate that\nthe factors are reliable in all four cases, with Hypotheses 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a and 4a all fully\nsupported in each individual organization. Hypothesis 4b, suggesting the moderating role of\ntrust between HCPM and justice, found support in three organizations. Hypothesis 1,\nsuggesting a direct link between experienced HCPM practices and employee commitment,\nand hypothesis 3b, suggesting the moderating role of trust between HCPM and commitment,\nwere supported in two organizations. In general, these results support the generalisability of\nthe findings, although further research would be needed in multiple settings to test this\nfurther.\nFinally, in continuing the discussion as to whether the three dimensions of organizational\njustice identified \u2013 procedural, distributive, interactional \u2013 do indeed exist as separate\ndimensions in the perceptions of employees (cf. Cropanzano et al., 2002; Greenberg, 1990),\nthis study has shown that separate factors did emerge in most of these dimensions. Only in the\narea of reward did employee opinions on procedural and interactional justice items overlap. In\nall other dimensions, distributive, interactional and procedural justice items created separate\nfactors.\n17\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nIn our exploration of the \u2018black box\u2019 debate on the link between HRM and performance, we\nhave seen how creating a set of practices for high commitment performance management that\nengender feelings of perceived justice amongst employees leads to increased levels of\nemployee commitment, moderated by employee levels of trust in the employer.\nFor organizations, this study emphasizes the importance of justice and trust to achieve desired\nperformance outcomes. As Folger and Konovsky (1989: 128) conclude: \u201cto be maximally\neffective in sustaining employee commitment to an organization and trust in its management,\nthose making allocative decisions [\u2026] must take procedural justice into account\u201d. Our\nfindings refine this statement to emphasize the moderating role of trust in achieving employee\ncommitment and perceptions of justice, as well as emphasizing the importance of three\ndifferent types of justice. The key is thus to find ways of triggering discretionary behaviour in\nemployees and management in order to stimulate organizational commitment (cf. Purcell et\nal., 2003). Particularly for the organizations involved in this study, our findings suggest that\nincreased focus on improving perceptions of justice, through ensuring line management are\ncapable of carrying out HCPM practices, may help improve commitment to the organization\nduring change.\nDespite the interesting findings emerging from this study, it is important to note that the\nresearch is based on self-report data on levels of commitment: future studies could try to\nmeasure this also from a line management perspective, for example, to help minimize possible\nproblems of common-method variance. In addition, we proposed a causal model for the\nlinkage between organizational justice and employee commitment and the role of trust, and\nalthough the findings from our cross-sectional study were consistent with the mediating and\nmoderating models proposed, alternative causal paths may be possible. A full exploration of\nthe causal links requires a longitudinal study.\nThe study presented here leads us to believe that it is essential to observe the actual employee\nexperience of HCPM practices and outcomes at employee level if we are to understand their\neffects on firm performance.\n18\nAppendix: Single company comparative results\nFinance Automotive Food Communication Full dataset\nReliability (Cronbach \u03b1)\nInteractional justice in appraisal and objective setting .935 .927 .914 .925 .928\nInteractional justice in reward .929 .930 .894 .904 .926\nProcedural justice in performance management .906 .910 .886 .925 .909\nDistributive justice in appraisal and objective setting .897 .893 .878 .865 .888\nDistributive justice in reward .838 .862 .822 .812 .836\nTrust in employer .876 .862 .858 .927 .899\nCommitment .832 .797 .753 .784 .830\nRegression (standardized \uf062)\nH1 (commitment)\nHCPM .099 .363** .191\uf085 .113 .163***\nH2a (justice)\nHCPM .368*** .392** .580*** .249* .389***\nH2b (commitment)\nJustice .332*** .336** .472*** .429*** .359***\nH2c (commitment)\nHCPM .024 .147 .063 .126 .082\nJustice .328*** .266* .461*** .453*** .354***\nANOVA (F values)\nH3a (commitment) 3.931*** 3.996*** 2.353** 4.407*** 8.398***\nH3b (commitment) 2.353*** 1.494 1.642\uf085 2.124** 2.594***\nH4a (justice) 3.451*** 2.945** 3.354*** 3.876*** 6.081***\nH4b (justice) 2.256*** 4.400*** 1.564\uf085 3.046*** 2.962***\n\uf085 p < .10, * p < .05, ** p<0.01, ***p<0.001.\n19\nREFERENCES\nArthur, J.
