Pamela Graves\nThe attack on images in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth century was not random destruction.\nParticular parts of the body, namely, the head and the hands, were the focus of attack. These were\nthe same foci against which capital and the severest forms of corporal punishment were aimed.\nDistinct from the theological reasons for iconoclasm, these persistent foci and forms of attack reveal\nsomething about attitudes to the body in this period and the privileging of the head and hands in\na number of social and cultural discourses. Iconoclasm both informs and was informed by an\nunderstanding of bodies as they were constructed in the later medieval and early modern periods.\nThe attack on statuary and images in sixteenth- and seven-\nteenth-century England was not random destruction. It was\ndirected against particular parts of the body, the same parts\nto which capital and corporal punishment was administered.\nI will explain why both statues and criminals were treated in\nthese specific ways and then place this in context and attempt\nto develop aspects of an anthropology of the body. I draw\nattention to continuities and changes between the late me-\ndieval and early modern periods that may have given a par-\nticular resonance to the anthromorphism of iconoclasm.\nIconoclasm has taken different forms in different contexts,\namong them Christian destruction of pagan images, Byzan-\ntine, Islamic, or French Revolutionary iconoclasm, pre-Con-\nquest Mesoamerican ritual mutilation of sculpted and painted\nheads, and political erasure, both ancient and modern, such\nas the shelling of the Bamiyan Buddha figures by the Taliban\nin Afghanistan in 2000 (e.g., Belting 1994, 144\u2013207; Barber\n2002; Gamboni 1997; Wilson 2005; Sauer 2003; Latour and\nWeibel 2002). Ancient Egyptian iconoclasts hacked the faces\nfrom stone images of pharaohs, and cartouches of their names\nwere erased. The Roman practice of damnatio memoriae in-\nvolved the physical erasure of the name or image of the dead\nfor political reasons (Elsner 1998, 12, 55\u201356). Sauer (2003,\n52) distinguished what he terms such \u201chalf-hearted pagan\niconoclasm\u201d from more vehement and systematic Early Chris-\ntian destruction in the Roman world but pointed out (p. 95)\nthat the face was universally selected for destruction. Con-\nC. Pamela Graves is a member of the Department of Archaeology\nat Durham University (Durham DH1 3LE, UK [c.p.graves@\ndurham.ac.uk]). This paper was submitted 13 XII 05 and accepted\n22 V 07.\nsequently, he did not seek to explain this in any particular\ncultural context. Anthropologists and sociologists, however,\naccept that the social meanings attached to the body vary\nwidely according to culture and period (Shilling 1993). The\nobjects of European later medieval and early modern icon-\noclastic mutilation were the head and the hands. The ap-\nproach taken here is therefore to seek to understand the sig-\nnificance of the head and the hands in the context of the\ncontemporary religious and social practices that gave them\nmeaning. This is not the blinkered pursuit of a Eurocentric\nagenda but rather an attempt to suggest that even in an area\nof scholarship so heavily dominated by the study of docu-\nments, an archaeological, material-culture approach informed\nby anthropology can throw up new, if challenging, insights\nfor the interpretation of the evidence and the period.\nPatterns and intensity of European Reformation icono-\nclasm varied regionally, leaving some areas with little imagery\nwhilst others retained much of the visual heritage and others\nretained damaged and partial fragments of former devotional\nimages (Eire 1986; Koerner 2004). Many images were de-\nstroyed completely, and there are historical references to sug-\ngest that a variety of means were deployed to dispose of images\nin some particular instances (Aston 1988; Wandel 1995; Ko-\nerner 2004, 105). But in England much statuary and two-\ndimensional imagery, although damaged, was not entirely\nobliterated and was left on view in its mutilated state. This\npaper is primarily concerned with these items, in which pre-\ncise features of the body, most frequently the head and the\nhands, were systematically targeted. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show\nchurch furnishings decorated with figures of saints. On the\ntwo-dimensional screens, the painted faces and\/or heads and\nsometimes the hands have been scraped off down to the raw\n36 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\nFigure 1.

Iconoclasm to the heads and hands of saints on the\nrood screen of Salthouse parish church, Norfolk.\nwood. On the font, the heads of all the sculptures have been\nknocked off.\nWhilst the theological basis of the attack on images has\nbeen extensively discussed elsewhere (e.g., Aston 1984, 1988,\n1993, 2003; Besanc\u00b8on 2000; Duffy 1992, 2001; Eire 1986;\nMacCulloch 2003; Phillips 1973; Spicer 2003), it is the im-\nplications of this selective, patterned destruction which are of\ninterest here. This paper departs from previous analyses of\niconoclasm by asking what the foci of this particular form of\niconoclasm tell us about cultural constructions of the body\nand what the methods of destruction reveal when examined\nfrom the perspective of other contemporary practices. It will\nbe argued that an archaeological approach to iconoclasm as\na culturally constructed practice of fragmentation broadens\nour understanding of the social and religious context of the\ntime. Iconoclasm both informs and was informed by an un-\nderstanding of bodies as they were constructed throughout\nthe later medieval and early modern periods.\nAn Archaeology of Iconoclasm\nThe ritual \u201ckilling of things\u201d has been explored in archaeology\nby Hamilakis (1998), Chapman (2000), and others. It is the\ncontention of this paper that the iconoclasm of the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries acted out ideas about the killing\nor mutilating of people. Miller (1985) has suggested that ar-\ntefacts embody the fundamental elements of human catego-\nrization processes, and it is argued here that the treatment of\nartefacts which were themselves depicting human form tells\nus about contemporary categorization of parts of the body\u2014\nthat is, the way in which bodies were deconstructed at a\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 37\nFigure 3. Iconoclasm to the heads of saints around the stem and\nbowl of the font at Watlington, Norfolk.\ncertain time can indicate aspects of how bodies were socially\nconstructed at that time.\nAmongst the most frequent objects of European later me-\ndieval and early modern iconoclastic mutilation were the head\nand the hands. I will therefore seek to understand the sig-\nnificance of head and hands in the context of the contem-\nporary religious and social practices that gave them meaning.\nThis approach examines iconoclasm as practical action which\nhad a direct and transforming impact on material culture.\nHistorians and art historians have shown that reformers and\niconoclasts had diverse motives, views, and values (Koerner\n2004, 2002; Aston 1988, 1993; Phillips 1973). Iconoclasm\nmight be official and unofficial, staged or spontaneous, en-\nacted during riots or by unknown individuals (Aston 1988;\nDavis 1973; Wandel 1995; Cressy 1999). Archaeology does not\nproceed by accounting for every observed material phenom-\nenon with a textual explanation. Many things have been so\nmuch taken for granted that they have not been written about,\nand many voices have not been recorded. It is axiomatic to\nan archaeological approach to iconoclasm that not all actions,\nmotivations, and intentions will have been recorded in written\ntestimony. The following draws on both material culture and\nwritten sources but cannot necessarily be proven in historical\naccounts.\nEnglish Iconoclasm\nEngland is a particularly suitable place in which to conduct\nthis examination, because iconoclasm in England was both\nmore protracted and more variable than in many parts of\nContinent. This was because of the changing intensity of re-\nform and violence against images during the successive reigns\nof Henry VIII and Edward VI, the return to a more orthodox\nCatholicism under Mary I, and the compromise sought under\nthe religious \u201csettlement\u201d of Elizabeth I. Episodes of icono-\nclasm recurred over the period of a century, from the late\n1530s to the 1650s (Aston 1988; Marks 2004, 255\u201375). During\nthe reign of Mary I (1553\u201358) many Catholic images were\nreinstated, and Protestant imagery and artefacts became the\nfocus of attack in a countermove (Cummings 2002). The\nPuritan and Presbyterian extremes of the mid-seventeenth\ncentury marked the last great episode in this complex process\n(Aston 1988, 62\u201395; Cooper 2001). It is, however, often dif-\nficult to determine precisely when particular images were de-\nstroyed unless the attacks were recorded. The archaeology of\nthe Dissolution of the English monasteries in the 1530s and\n1540s has on the whole left a picture of asset-stripping and\nsalvage rather than ideologically inspired iconoclasm (Morris\n2003). Very few instances of archaeologicaly stratified icon-\noclasm have been reported for any period; still fewer offer a\nway of differentiating iconoclastic episodes.\nLincoln Cathedral and the neighbouring church of St. Paul-\nin-the-Bail provide a remarkable example of the conjunction\nof archaeological and historical sources. Lincoln Cathedral\nsuffered iconoclastic attacks in both the sixteenth and the\nseventeenth century. During excavation of the well in the\nchurchyard of St. Paul-in-the-Bail, architectural fragments\noriginating from the medieval shrine of Little St. Hugh in the\ncathedral were found in archaeologically datable contexts. The\nmost important is the damaged head (fig. 4) of one of the\nfigures which projected from the bases of the gables on the\nfacade of the shrine. Significantly, the damage on the head\nhas two distinct physical characteristics. The face has been\nchipped off with a small chisel and partially smoothed over,\nwhereas the marks on the base were made by a larger chisel,\nand this rough hacking corresponds exactly with that on the\nremaining parts of the shrine in the cathedral. Ceramics, clay\npipes, and wine bottles date the relevant archaeological layer\nto the early\/mid-seventeenth century (Graves n.d., 1994). The\nshrine was still largely intact in 1641, as a drawing from this\ndate reveals (British Library, Loan MS 38; Stocker 1986, p1.\n38 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\nFigure 4. Sculpted figure found in the churchyard well, St. Paul-\nin-the-Bail, Lincoln (line drawing by Y. Beadnell after an original\nby D. Watt, City of Lincoln Archaeology Unit).\n23D). Significantly, the drawing shows some of the projecting\nheads remaining on the central tabernacle of the shrine. The\nshrine was probably destroyed in 1644 as part of Parliament\u2019s\nprogramme of iconoclasm. John Evelyn visited Lincoln Ca-\nthedral in 1654 and noted the destruction: \u201cThe soldiers had\nlately knocked off all or most of the brasses which were on\nthe gravestones: . . . they told us they went in with axes and\nhammers, and shut themselves in, till they had rent and torn\noff some barges full of metal; not sparing the monuments of\nthe dead\u201d (de Beer 1955:132). The archaeological context,\nhowever, suggests that we may be witnessing the physical\nresults of two separate episodes of iconoclasm, for if much of\nthe sculpted detail remained on the shrine until 1644, it had\nevidently survived the first order to break up shrines in Lin-\ncoln, issued under Henry VIII in June 1540 (Lincoln Record\nSociety 1917, 35\u201336):\nForasmuche as we understande that there is a certen shryne\ndyverse feyned reliquys and juellys in the cathedral churche\nof Lincoln wherwith all the simple people be moche de-\nceyvyd and brought in to gret superstition and idolatrye to\nthe dishonor of god and gret slaunder of this our realme\nand perill of ther soulys. We lett you wyt, that therfor beyng\nmyndyd to brynge our loveying subjects to the right knowl-\nedge of the truths takeyng awaye all occasions of idolatrye\nand superstition [. . . the king has] appointed certain com-\nmissioners. . . . to take downe as well the sayd shrine, su-\nperstitiose reliques as superstitiose juellys, plate, copes and\nother suchelike. . . .\nThe iconoclasm of Henry VIII\u2019s successor, Edward VI, was\nmore thorough. Proclamations specified that people should\n\u201cdeface and destroy or cause to be defaced and destroyed\u201d\nimages (Statutes of the Realm, iv\/I, III; 3-4 Ed. VI, cap. 10,\nquoted in Aston 1988, 267). I believe that the first phase of\ndamage to the figure from the shrine of Little St. Hugh, the\nerasure of the face (fig. 4), dates to this period. However, the\nhead remained on the shrine in this damaged state for another\ncentury. The conjunction of archaeological and documentary\nevidence at Lincoln suggests that in the first phase it was\nsufficient simply to deface the figures of this shrine in order\nto render them innocuous. By the mid-seventeenth century,\nhowever, the very fact that any part of the shrine survived\nwas offensive. This was when the defaced head was finally\nknocked off the structure. More generally, Dowsing\u2019s journal\nand the activities of his contemporary Culmer prove that in\nSuffolk and Kent, as in many other parts of England, enough\nimagery had survived the iconoclasm of the 1500s to form a\ntarget in the mid-1600s (Aston 1988, 62\u201395; Cooper 2001).\nThe Punishment of the Images\nIdeas that were prevalent in the later Middle Ages imbued\nthe head and the hands with more of the symbolic life-force\nthan other parts of the body, and these were supported by\nsocial and religious practices which underlined these special\nroles. Iconoclasm was therefore not random destruction or\nvandalism but focused and deliberate. It was predicated on\nideas which made images potent and was a specific denial of\nthose ideas. Most frequently faces and heads were attacked;\nheads and hands together were the next most frequent targets.\nWhat were the ideas which made these parts of the body\nparticularly abominable? To understand this, we must first\nlook at the way in which statues and images were destroyed.\nIn the later medieval period, the attitude of the laity towards\nimages ranged from sophisticated understanding of the theo-\nlogical precepts to animistic veneration and superstitious\npractices and included critics of image veneration (Aston\n1988, 19\u201334; Duffy 1992 and 2001; Eire 1986; Kamerick 2002;\nMacCulloch, Laven, and Duffy 2006; Marks 2004; Wandel\n1995, 38\u201351). Despite the theological arguments, images were\noften regarded as representing saints in real ways. The Church\ndid not always discourage such beliefs (Marks 2004; Belting\n1994; Freedberg 1991), and it has been argued that some\namongst the laity regarded saints as powerful friends and\nhelpers (Duffy 1992, 160, 169\u201383). These patron-client re-\nlations mirror the clientage practiced in late medieval En-\ngland, with lay people becoming clients of particular saints,\npaying the \u201cdebt of interchanging neighbourhood\u201d between\nthe living and the dead (or eternally living) as explained in\nthe Golden Legend (Duffy 1992, 160). Numerous gifts and\nbequests were made to images, which created relations of\nmutual indebtedness between saint and follower (Graves\n2000a). This understanding underpinned the earlier practice\nof the humiliation of saints and occasionally resulted in phys-\nical violence against relics echoing criminal sanctions (Geary\n1983). Recorded instances of this practice took place when a\nsaint who was considered by a population or monastic com-\nmunity to be its patron was deemed to have failed in his or\nher obligations to that community under the patron-client\nrelationship. The image or relics of the saint would be ritually\ndebased, placed in ashes on the floor, and sometimes phys-\nically attacked, with the assailants drawing on the physical\n\u201cvocabulary\u201d of punishments that they themselves would ex-\nperience if they failed in an obligation or duty.\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 39\nAmongst reformers, there were differing views on the role\nof images and consequently differing degrees of toleration or\nhostility towards them from reform centre to centre. Some,\nlike Calvin, denied that images were in any sense conduits\nfor God\u2019s power; images which encouraged idolatrous beliefs\nand erroneous faith in intercessors polluted the temples of\nGod. Such arguments effectively negated the patron-client\nrelationship between the laity and the saints; therefore, where\nthese beliefs were promulgated, it could be perceived that the\npatron (and the image) had betrayed the client. The belief\nthat the carved images were merely inert matter had to be\ndemonstrated. If the theology which sanctioned images was\nfalse, then the images themselves were false and could be\nchallenged. There were precedents in England for the \u201ctesting\u201d\nor \u201ctrying\u201d of images, especially amongst the Lollard followers\nof John Wycliffe in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries. The\nLollards were regarded as heretics by the Church establish-\nment, and they rejected much Catholic tradition and doctrine,\nincluding attitudes to pilgrimage and images (Aston 1984,\n1993). Amongst other things, they criticized the popular belief\nthat images embodied saints rather than providing a vehicle\nfor instruction. Two Lollards were reported to have \u201ctested\u201d\na wooden statue of St. Catherine by axe and fire (Kamerick\n2002, 127): \u201cLet us try her sainthood, they said. If she is truly\nworthy of adoration she will bleed: if not, into the fire with\nher. So while one of them held the figure, the other took an\naxe and cut off its head. . . . The St. Catherine was burnt\nbecause it was a sham. It evinced no sign of life; it could not\nprove itself\u201d (Aston 1988, 133). Aston has sought to explain\nwhy burning was a particularly apt method of destruction.\nStatues were burnt in spectacularly staged public circum-\nstances, sometimes after being imprisoned, tried, and sen-\ntenced as heretics (Camille 1989, 224). These images were\nbeing treated just like certain categories of condemned crim-\ninal\u2014witches, traitors, heretics\u2014and given appropriate cor-\nporal and capital punishment. A gruesome example was the\ndual burning in May 1538 of the Observant friar John Forest\nand the figure of St. Derfel removed from Llandderfel in Wales\n(Aston 1993, 276). The friar was burnt for his loyalty to the\npope, hence his treason to the king; the image was burnt\nbecause its reputation for miraculous powers was false, hence\na form of treason to the laity. Aston\u2019s thesis is that burning\nhad a particular resonance for the Reformers. Karlstadt,\nHa\u00a8tzer, and others identified fire as God\u2019s chosen punishment\nfor idols and their worshippers (Mangrum and Scavizzi 1991,\n20, 37; Aston 1993, 293) on the basis of numerous Old Tes-\ntament precedents (e.g., Deuteronomy 7:5, 12:3). There was\nalso the long-standing notion that burning, which reduced\nthe accused to the smallest possible particles of dust and ashes,\npurified the convicted heretic (Aston 1993, 294; see also Davis\n1973, 55).\nAston\u2019s thesis is compelling. Iconoclasm also took many\nother forms, however, and it is argued here that these also\nfind their logical explanation in contemporary practices of\ncapital and corporal punishment. Equally spectacular public\ndismemberments of images\u2014the striking of the heads and\nhands from statues\u2014took place. This was not because these\nwere the most easily accessible projections: two-dimensional\nimages had their faces and hands obliterated as well, usually\nwith deep gouging into the wood reflecting the force applied\nto the task (fig. 1). There were biblical precedents for such\nmutilations. When God struck down a false idol he targeted\nthe head and the hands (I Samuel 5:2\u20134, my emphasis):\nWhen the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it\ninto the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. And when\nthey of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon\nwas fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the\nLord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.\nAnd when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold,\nDagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the\nark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms\nof his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump\nof Dagon was left to him.\nThus God himself had set a pattern for the mutilation of\nidols. John Knox, the Calvinist Scottish reformer, referred to\nthis text specifically when the head and hands of the statue\nof St. Giles were knocked off in Edinburgh in 1558 (Higgitt\n2003, 17).\nTwo-dimensional images might of course have been white-\nwashed rather than mutilated (Aston 1988, 93). The rood\nscreen of Binham Priory, Norfolk, which was whitewashed\nand then painted over with texts from Tyndale\u2019s English trans-\nlation of the Bible, is often cited as the embodiment of the\ntriumph of the Word over the Image. However, considerable\nnumbers of heads, hands, or feet painted in two dimensions\non wood were scraped off first, sometimes deeply gouged out,\neven if they were later painted over. In other words, to para-\nphrase Barthes (1990, 4), the hiding can be seen. Simply paint-\ning over the face and hands did not signal the \u201cdeath\u201d of the\nimage\u2014did not deprive it of power. Such subtleties were un-\nderstood in the later Middle Ages, because chancel screens in\nchurches acted in an analogous way\u2014partly masking the\nclergy and the Mass in order to emphasize them (cf. also Jung\n2000). The parclose screens that defined family chapels in\nEnglish churches divided the elite from the congregation but\nallowed the elite occupants to be seen as separate and therefore\nsocially distinct (Graves 2000a). Thus to cover an image was\none thing: to remove physically all traces of its head and\nhands, and in such a way as to make repainting difficult, was\nquite another. Some reformers sought to retain the damaged\nimages in order to demonstrate their inanimate and powerless\nnature, unmasking their emptiness (Koerner 2002, 179, 164).\nOne two-dimensional medium often cited as surviving de-\nstruction for practical reasons is glass. Stained-glass windows\nwere a necessary protection against the elements and too\ncostly to replace with unpainted glass; Luther, Zwingli, and\nCalvin all spoke out against glass-breaking (Aston 1988, 257,\nn. 10). Prior to 1547 only the most radical reformers in En-\ngland had advocated the destruction of images in windows\n40 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\n(Aston 1988, 256\u201358). Occasional survivals demonstrate that\nfaces could be targeted, as at Great Massingham, Norfolk,\nwhere the saints\u2019 faces and the Lamb of God were replaced\nwith plain glass (Phillips 1973, fig. 16). In some parishes,\nnotably in Kent, the heads and faces of saints in stained-glass\nwindows were masked by painting them out (Aston 1988,\n260\u201361, n. 19). However, there are very few examples of such\nmasking. I would suggest that this is because it was an un-\nsatisfactory way of denying the power of images. By contrast,\nwhen the monastic houses were officially dissolved in the late\n1530s, glass windows were destroyed routinely because they\nwere no longer needed to fulfil their primary function of\nkeeping out wind and rain. The archaeological patterning of\nbroken glass from sixteenth-century deposits demonstrates\nthat images were deliberately attacked to a greater extent than\nis normally appreciated (Graves 2000b, 462\u201364). Much more\nglass seems to have been destroyed in the parish churches\nand college chapels in the 1640s (Cooper 2001, 89\u201393,\n391\u201395).\nCorporal and Capital Punishment\nImages were variously burned, drowned, or beheaded: an im-\nage of the Virgin was hanged in England in the early 1530s\n(Aston 1988, 212); a statue of St. Francis was hanged at Ayr,\nin Scotland, in 1537, and the great statue of St. Giles in Ed-\ninburgh was drowned before it was burnt (Higgitt 2003, 17).\nThe most obvious context for comparison is official punish-\nment enacted on the body. The equivalence of punishments\nmeted out to statues and to offenders has been stressed by\nboth contemporaries and modern historians (Davis 1973). I\nbelieve that this can be taken farther: there was tacit ac-\nknowledgement of the appropriate body locus for judicial\nviolence according to the crime committed, based on an un-\nderstanding of the relative role and value of body parts. Ex-\nceptional bodily punishment was in fact meted out only to\ntraitors, heretics, and other extreme criminals (Dean 2001,\n124):\nFor the most serious of crimes, the most serious penalties\nwere reserved: the multilation of ears, lips and tongue, the\namputation of hands, feet and ears, the gouging out of eyes,\nor death by hanging, beheading or other means. . . . There\nwas a code to the assignment of mode of capital execution.\nDismemberment was reserved for traitors and conspirators.\n. . . Burning was for crimes requiring \u201cextreme purification\nby the total elimination of the offender\u2019s body.\u201d\nThus the seriousness of the crime was mapped out on the\nbody (Merback 1999, 139\u201340). The \u201ctariff\u201d of monetary fines\nfor attacking people physically varied according to the part\nof the body attacked. The examples cited by Dean (2001, 132)\nindicate clearly that mutilations to the head consistently cost\nmore in monetary reparation. Blinding in both eyes incurred\nthe highest penalty. An attack leaving a facial scar accrued a\nmuch greater fine than did the severing of a limb, but an\nattack leaving a \u201cshameful\u201d mark on the face cost even more,\nimplying that such marks resembled those inflicted through\njudicial punishment. To put this in context, in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries a woman accused of whoredom or\nadultery was given the whore\u2019s mark on her face, often a slit\nnose (Hallam 2004, 251). To damage the nose on a male was\nto imply sodomy (Groebner 2004). This made the sins of the\nlower body visible on the face. Scholarly culture of the Middle\nAges considered the beauty or physical integrity of the face\nto reflect the inner honesty and integrity of the soul and taught\nthat facial flaws were signs of sin (e.g., Albertus Magnus,\nwriting in the thirteenth century; Groebner 2004, 75; Synnott\n1993, 73\u2013102). Thus to damage or defile the face was to\ndamage reputation and honour.\nThe metaphor of the body politic extended to a conception\nof the body parts rendering quasi-feudal service to one an-\nother and to their higher, governing organs. The corollary\nwas that the head of the body\u2014the king or prince\u2014had the\npower to \u201cdivide others who threatened the body politic with\ndivision\u201d (Binski 1996, 65). High treason, encompassing\ncrimes against the ruler, the ruler\u2019s family, and high officials,\nwas rewarded with the severing of the head in particular; petty\ntreason, encompassing the slaying of a master or mistress by\na servant or of a husband by a wife, was also punishable by\nexecution, usually by aggravated hanging for men and burning\nat the stake for women (Bellamy 1970; 1973, 189; 1979, 9;\nHanawalt 2000, 197; Gowing 2003, 7). Punishment restored\nthe purity and integrity of the social body. Bodily mutilation\nfor lesser crimes had died out in England by 1300, and any\nform of judicial bodily mutilation had become rare by the\nfifteenth century, save for treason. There was, however, a re-\nsurgence of bodily punishment under the Tudors, and, from\n1534, during Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome, even pronounc-\ning the king a heretic, schismatic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper\nwas deemed high treason (Bellamy 1979, 31, 181\u201392). Many\nmore people were charged with treason than before, because\nit was necessary to secure the new succession and religious\nauthority. Although the ultimate punishment for high treason\nwas to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, under the Tudors\nthe rope and the axe accounted for 99% of all such deaths\n(Bellamy 1979, 207). Thus hanging and beheading were the\npunishments most symbolic of treachery in that age. More-\nover, tongues and hands that had committed blasphemy\nmight be abscised. When the Protestant William Gardiner\nwas executed for heresy in Portugal in 1552, his hands were\ncut off before he was burnt and placed in the fire with him\n(Aston 1993, 299). The Covenanters who opposed the im-\nposition of the king\u2019s Episcopalian Church in Scotland had\ntheir right hands cut off before they were hanged in 1638\n(Thomson 1886, 239\u201340).\nSpectators and Agency\nOther readings of public judicial violence may inform an\nunderstanding of iconoclasm or at least of the competing\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 41\ninterpretations audiences may have put upon the acts. Mer-\nback (1999) has argued that capital punishment can be read\nnot only as state authoritarianism, retribution, and deterrence\nbut also, in popular perception, as a spectacle in which com-\nmunities made great religious investment in the \u201cgood death\u201d\nof criminals (Spierenburg 1984). Good deaths had a penitent\nand salvific quality that restored to the crowd its sense of\nproper social and moral order. The crowd could engage in a\nmystical identity between Christ\u2019s passion and the torment\nof the condemned (passio and compassio), and this emotional\nparticipation restored a sense of power and agency to people\notherwise excluded from the judicial decisions and events\nwhich had led to the execution (Merback 1999, 141\u201357). In\nEngland, official dismemberments and burnings were some-\ntimes publicized in order to collect as large a crowd as pos-\nsible, for it was the transformative effect on the religious ideas\nof the crowd\u2014its consent\u2014which was crucial to the project\nof reform (Aston 1993, 262, 310). In the discourse of public\nexecution, spectators became agents; corporate veneration\nturned to corporate vilification.\nThis analysis of crowd expectations and behaviour in of-\nficial situations complements our understanding of popular\nriot, in which the crowd assumed quasi-judicial powers to\nenact rituals of punishment on those deemed to have escaped\nproper retribution. Such action also created a precedent for\nreligious rites of violence. Official policy moved too slowly\nfor some reformers, who took matters literally into their own\nhands. Much popular, unofficial, and even clandestine icon-\noclasm was improvised from a repertory of forms of popular\nand unofficial justice and rituals of humiliation (Davis 1973;\nAston 1993; Berlin 1997). Images were also used as proxies\nfor the punishment and defamation of those who escaped the\nlaw (Jones 2002; Groebner 2004; Freedberg 1991, 246\u201382).\nThis probably drew on other traditions of the use of images\nand effigies as proxies for political bodies, for example, in\nritually liminal contexts such as royal and heraldic funerals\nin the medieval and early modern periods, as well as the\nsymbolic stonings and beheadings of effigies of Carnival in\nparts of Europe (Kantorowicz 1957; Ruff 2001). In England,\nthose who carried out acts of iconoclasm varied across the\nperiod according to specific royal injunctions, parish circum-\nstances, and individual initiative. In recorded instances arti-\nsans may have constituted the majority, but there were also\nparsons, vicars, and curates, lay preachers, churchwardens,\ncollege radicals, merchants, villagers, and mobs (Aston 1988,\npassim). As Wandel (1995) has pointed out, however, the\nphysical act of iconoclasm gave a voice to many who were\nnot preachers, writers, or officials and whose names are\nunknown.\nThe next section explores further aspects of the social world\nand practices from which the agents of iconoclasm might\ndraw their \u201cvocabulary\u201d for attacks on images. Whereas we\ncannot know what has disappeared without trace, there is no\ngetting away from the fact that the surviving remains display\nremarkably consistent targets for attack.\nHead and Hands in Medieval and\nEarly Modern Discourse\nIt has been argued above that, in certain contexts, the head\nand the hands were thought to embody more of the symbolic\nlife-force than other parts of the body; thus if they were the\nkey life-signifiers, their destruction was intended to deny the\nlife or reality of the being portrayed. There is a considerable\narchaeological literature concerning the body (e.g., Hamilakis,\nPluciennik, and Tarlow 2002; Fowler 2004; Gilchrist 2004;\nJoyce 2004), and historians have examined medieval and early\nmodern aspects of the body in art, literature, and social con-\ntexts (Kay and Rubin 1994; Biller and Minnis 1997; Grantley\nand Taunton 2000; Kleinschmidt 2000). Recent work em-\nphasizes an anti-essentialist stance, the multiplicity of valences\nof bodies, and the plurality of social identities, varying with\nstatus, gender, age, occupation, and life experience (e.g., Butler\n1993; Gilchrist 1997, 1999, 2004). Some approaches have ex-\nplored the relevance of the fissuring or the cleaving of bodies\nin relation to female piety and mysticism (e.g., Bynum 1987,\n1989). Others have examined the humoral conception of the\nbody, space, and metaphor (e.g., Gilchrist 1999). As Bynum\n(1999) has argued, there were many medieval bodies, and\neven within orthodox Christian discourses there was no single\nconcept of \u201cthe body\u201d (see also Biernoff [2002, 17\u201339] on\nthe interrelatedness of body, flesh, and soul). Women\u2019s lives\nin the early modern period have been examined by, for ex-\nample, Gowing (2003), Wiesner (2000), and Mendelson and\nCrawford (1998). Masculinities and male bodies have been\nexamined for medieval Europe (e.g., Hadley 1999) and early\nmodern England (e.g., Breitenberg 1996; Fisher 2001).\nNone of these works has, however, examined the link be-\ntween iconoclasm, the fragmentation of the body, and the\nvalue or meaning accorded to parts of the body through social\npractice. My approach to this topic is informed by the work\nof Bourdieu (1987), Douglas (1970, 1980), Giddens (1986),\nGoffman (1987), Turner (1997), and others. I argue that, for\nthe head and hands to be accorded a significance beyond the\neveryday, there would have to be discourses which built up,\nthrough social practice, cultural horizons of meaning, sym-\nbolism, and attributes in the social worlds of those who took\npart in iconoclasm. From this rarefied vocabulary of meaning,\niconoclasts could draw their knowledge of how to proceed in\nthe context of attacking images (cf. Giddens 1986; Barrett\n1988). The following sections explore a number of practices\nthrough which this could happen; the list is by no means\ncomprehensive but seeks to open the field for further\nexploration.\nArt, Life, and Body Metaphors\nMedieval theologians taught that Art was subordinate to Na-\nture, and this was conveyed in secular themes: in the Roman\nde la Rose, Art could not breathe life into her images. In a\n1282 manuscript of the story of Zeuxis, the artist is on the\n42 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\npoint of colouring the face and hands of his statue of Helen\n(Muse\u00b4e Conde\u00b4 MS 590). To explain this image, Camille (1989,\n318) says that the face and hands were the key life-signifiers,\nbut he does not elaborate on the origins or currency of this\nidea or on its implications. If we are to place the idea in\ncontext, the starting point must be the fact that the body\nprovided a widely deployed metaphor in the Middle Ages.\nA potent Christian body metaphor conceived of the Church\nas a single body or organism, with Christ as its head, and as\na hierarchy which privileged the high over the low. This hi-\nerarchical image was appropriated for political use, and the\nfeudal household was conceived of as a corps (body) with a\nchef (head), the members and the lord respectively. In the\nformulation of the body politic the head governed all and\nwas explicitly identified with the prince or king: \u201cthe function\nof the eyes, the ears and the tongue is assured by the judges\nand provincial governors. . . . The \u2018officers\u2019 and \u2018soldiers\u2019\n. . . can be compared to the hands\u201d (John of Salisbury, 1159,\nPolicraticus, quoted in Le Goff 1989, 17). Thus the king\u2019s\nprovincial representatives were his eyes, ears, and mouthpiece,\nand the king acted in the community through his knights.\nThe lowest members of the community, the peasants or la-\nbourers, were identified with the feet. The head was thus a\nmetaphor for the formulation of principle, and the hands\nwere a metaphor for the implementation of principle\u2014im-\nportant agents but subsidiary to the overall rule of the head.\nWhether the identity of the metaphoric head was secular or\nreligious was disputed, especially by the Church, as was the\npriority of head or heart (Le Goff 1989, 18\u201323; Binski 1996,\n65; Blamires 1997). Civic Corpus Christi processions provided\none of the most widely projected expressions of the meta-\nphorical Christian body, even if the reality of social exclusion\nand guild competition belied the ideological intention of rep-\nresenting a unified community (James 1983; Rubin 1991,\n243\u201371).\nOutside the elite sphere of political or theological discourse,\nthe body metaphor applied somewhat differently to the in-\ncorporation of trade and craft guilds. The idea of fraternity,\nwith \u201cmembers subsumed in a common substance,\u201d coexisted\nwith hierarchy, experienced in craft discipline and the physical\nordering of bodies at guild courts and in religious processions\n(Farr 2000). Furthermore, traditional guild inspections of\nproducts in London took place in choreographed processions\nof the guild and civic officials making stops at each workshop.\nContemporary records use the language of judicial punish-\nment and iconoclasm to describe what happened to any con-\ndemned goods. They were \u201cbroken all in pieces,\u201d \u201cburnt and\nconsumed,\u201d \u201cbroken defaced and spoiled\u201d (Berlin 1997, 81).\nAs with public executions and public spectacles of iconoclasm,\nthese public demonstrations were designed to uphold the col-\nlective or corporate reputation of the trade.\nIn the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the\nReformation gave new preeminence to the metaphor of the\nbody politic and a new scale of application within the house-\nhold. It dismissed the authority of the priestly confessor and\nreplaced it with the authority of the patriarchal head of the\nhousehold (Aughterson 1995, passim; Fletcher 1994). The\nbody politic was but one of many coexisting medieval body\nmetaphors. Gilchrist has drawn attention to textual uses of\nthe female body as a metaphor for \u201csafe, contained places\u201d\nin application to castles, to the integrity of kingdoms, to the\ninterior of the body in medical texts, and to the range of\nmetaphors used for the female body itself (1999, 138\u201345).\nFor some, the eyes specifically were the surest sign of life\nin an image. There were several competing theories of vision\nin the medieval period, mostly derived from ancient Greece\nand filtered through Islamic thinking. The \u201cextramission\u201d the-\nory of Euclid (ca. 300 BC) and Ptolemy (ca. 170 BC) and the\n\u201cintromission\u201d theory of Aristotle both proposed quasi-phys-\nical rays connecting the object and the viewer\u2019s eye (Smith\n2004, 327; Lindbery 1987; Miles 1986, 96; Biernoff 2002, 91).\nSeeing something was in effect touching it through a visual\nray; to see the consecrated host, for example, was to touch\nChrist, and this had a salvific effect (Miles 1986, 96). Bacon\u2019s\nthirteenth-century synthesis maintained that species entered\nthe optic nerve (Smith 2004; Lindberg 1987; Biernoff 2002,\n63\u2013107). Consequently, some theologians taught that the eyes\nrepresented a portal through which harmful, sinful, and de-\nlusional qualities could entice the viewer (Cressy 1999, 40;\nBiernoff 2002). Furthermore, there was something special\nabout the direct gaze of statues: they looked not above their\nworshippers but at them, as if to engage them in direct in-\nterpersonal communication through the meeting of the eyes\n(Aston 1988, 401; Baxandall 1980, 166; Dahl 1978). Inte-\ngrating these optical theories with pious traditions of the later\nMiddle Ages, Biernoff (2002) has argued that the relationship\nbetween viewer and image was one of reciprocity, in which\noptical, carnal, and redemptive vision combined to allow for\nbodily participation in the divine, what she calls \u201cocular com-\nmunion.\u201d \u201cTo see was to become similar to one\u2019s object\u201d and\nentailed \u201ca certain violence to the self, as one became like\none\u2019s object\u201d (pp. 137, 138). This concept has enormous im-\nplications for iconoclasm, perhaps as a means to prevent any\ncontinuing interaction: there are a few instances of the eyes\u2019\nhaving been scratched out of a religious image\u2019s face (e.g., on\nthe rood screen of Thornham, Norfolk). For some reformers,\nthe eye was a potential traitor, and hearing was privileged over\nsight (Miles 1986, 95; Wandel 1995).\nArt and legal depositions from the period provide insights\ninto vernacular practices and ideas concerning the head and\nthe hands. Many signs of infamy, humiliation, insult, and\ndefilement focused on the head, as did everyday figures of\nabusive speech (Hallam 2004), while the substitution of an-\nimal heads on human bodies and depictions of multiple heads\nboth indicated the foolish and the monstrous (Jones 2002,\n68\u201373). Such derisive iconography was particularly prevalent\nin Reformation propaganda on both sides (Jones 2002, 73;\nGaimster 1997, 142\u201355), involving inversions of the normal\nhierarchy, political or domestic, satirized by the inversion of\nhead and feet or head and buttocks. Sometimes abusive ac-\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 43\ntions in these terms were performed to humiliate a religious\nimage in addition to its \u201ccapital\u201d punishment. For example,\nrams\u2019 horns were nailed to the head of the statue of St. Francis\nthat was hanged in Ayr in 1537, and a \u201ckowe\u2019s rumpe\u201d was\nnailed to the statue\u2019s buttocks (Higgitt 2003, 31, n. 74). In\nthe seventeenth century portraits of political enemies were\noften slashed on the face prior to immolation (Cressy 1999,\n34, 30\u201331).\nBut whatever the head and the hands meant in political or\nartistic conceptions, if these meanings were to be prevalent\nin society at large they would have to be made apparent in\na wide variety of contexts and discourses. The following sec-\ntions explore the practices by which such meanings may have\nbeen sustained and reproduced.\nHead and Hands in Rituals\nHands were inevitably the medium of all rituals, but many\nof the seven sacraments or rites of transition of the medieval\nchurch contained a pronounced focus on the head and\/or\nhands. This section explores some of these, drawing on some\nreligious and elite texts, amongst other sources, for illustrative\nmaterial. Such items had limited social circulation, and pre-\nscriptive texts did not necessarily determine action; action\nwas contingent upon context and the circumstances and im-\nprovisation of agents (Rubin 1991; Graves 2000a; Giddens\n1986). In practice, liturgies were subject to unregulated in-\nterpretation. Nonetheless, because many of the sacraments\nwere intended to influence the lives of the majority, they are\nused to gain an idea of the general characteristics of practice.\nIn baptism by immersion, the sponsor might lay a hand\non the infant\u2019s head (B. M. Cott. MS. Julius E. iv, f. I, d\n[Kingsford 1921, 7, fig. 3]). The child would be anointed on\nthe forehead (Kingsford 1921, 13, fig. 6) and a lighted taper,\nsupported by the priest\u2019s own hand, perhaps placed in its\nhand (The Arte or Crafte to Lyve Well, Soc. Ant. f. xxxvii\n[Kingsford 1921, 15, fig. 7]). During confirmation the\nbishop\u2019s hands were raised over the group of candidates; each\nwas anointed with cream on the forehead and had a chrism\ncloth tied round his or her head (Soc. Ant. f. xl [Kingsford\n1921, 20\u201321, fig. 10]). Absolution was marked by the priest\u2019s\ntouching the head of the penitent with a discipline rod (B.\nM. Add. 25698, f. 9 [Kingsford 1921, 22\u201323, fig. 11]) or\nplacing his hand upon the penitent\u2019s head (Soc. Ant. f. xlii,\nd [Kingsford 1921, 27, fig. 13]). On Ash Wednesday, the pen-\nitent was marked with ashes on the forehead (B. M. Add.\n18851, f. 69, d [Kingsford 1921, 29, fig. 15]). At communion,\nthe wafer was usually placed directly into the communicant\u2019s\nmouth (B. M. Royal 2B. vii, f. 207, d [Kingsford 1921, 30\u201331,\nfig. 16]). The marriage ceremony required the priest to join\nthe hands of the betrothed together at the church door and\nagain before the altar after the ring had been placed on the\nbride\u2019s fourth finger (Sarum Manual [Kingsford 1921, 34\u201335,\nfig. 19; 42\u201343, fig. 23]). The handing over and the ring were\nthe most contested parts of the post-Reformation marriage\nrite (Cressy 1997, 339\u201347).\nAfter childbirth women might undergo rites of purification\nbefore acceptance back into the parish community. In the\npre-Reformation rite, holy water, candles, and the wearing of\na veil over the head were the principal material features. The\n1552 Prayer Book did away with all three, but the wearing of\nveils or kerchiefs over the head persisted as the popular out-\nward sign of the event and was highly disputed by religious\nradicals (Gowing 2003, 47\u201348; Cressy 1997, 216\u201329).\nThe priesthood of the Catholic Church itself was repro-\nduced through the laying-on of hands, and there were many\nother components of the ordination rite relating to the head\nand the hands (Cullum 2004, 64). The first tonsure on the\nhead of a cleric was a significant rite of passage (Cullum 2004,\n56).\nAs death approached, the dying person might be helped to\nhold a lighted candle (B. M. Add. 18854, f. 78, d. [Kingsford\n1921, 49, fig. 26]). Absolution was marked by the laying of\nthe priest\u2019s hand on the dying person\u2019s head (Kingsford 1921,\n53, fig. 28). In the Sarum Manual unction proceeded from\nthe sensory organs of the head down the body to the hands,\nfeet, and back (Kingsford 1921, 54). Upon death, the corpse\nwould be sprinkled with holy water, again starting with the\nhead. Although most corpses were wrapped in cloth prior to\nburial, the head and the hands might sometimes be left visible\n(Horae of the Regent Philip, Pierpoint Morgan Collection\n[Kingsford 1921, 83, fig. 43]). Archaeological excavation in\nEngland has often revealed that the head of a burial was given\ngreater emphasis than the rest of the body, for example, with\nwooden plank covers extending only as far as the neck, the\ninclusion of head recesses in cists, and stones surrounding\nthe head or supporting the head both where no other cist\nexisted and inside stone coffins (Gilchrist and Sloane 2005;\nWhite 1988). Gilchrist and Sloane consider that these practices\nallowed the head to be exposed during the final burial rites.\nThey cite commentaries on the liturgy from the eighth to the\nthirteenth century in which the head was important in burial,\nfor example, the place of the head at the Resurrection marking\nwhere the rest of the body would be assembled (Gilchrist and\nSloane 2005, 139; Bynum 1995, 212).\nAmongst the aristocracy, post-mortem bodily division was\nwidespread by the thirteenth century. It allowed a patron to\nsupport a number of institutions by leaving parts of his or\nher body to be buried in each. However, the hierarchical\nconcept of the body resulted in sensitivities amongst the re-\nceiving institutions; few were happy to \u201creceive those parts\nof the body which were lower in the physical hierarchy, and\nmore closely associated with appetite, vice and disease\u201d (Bin-\nski 1996, 63). Furthermore, the logical consistency of the body\nmetaphor can be seen in the fact that in the medieval pun-\nishment for high treason the quartering (bodily division) of\nthe offender was preceded by the burning of the entrails and\nheart, since \u201ctreasonable thoughts must arise in the entrails\u201d\n(Bellamy 1979, 204). The hierarchy of the body was both\n44 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\npolitical and affective: \u201cthe head remained the official site of\nthe burial of the person,\u201d but the heart came to be regarded\nas the \u201cseat of piety\u201d because of the Christian head\/heart\npairing (Binski 1996, 64). Consequently, the heart was often\ngiven to institutions to which the donor felt particularly de-\nvoted. Thus Eleanor of Castile (d. 1290), queen of Edward I,\narranged for her heart to be buried at the Dominican priory\nin London, her entrails in Lincoln Cathedral, and her body\nat Westminster Abbey, \u201cmarking the latter as the head of the\nkingdom\u201d (Binski 1996, 64). Bodily division of saints was of\ncourse well established, and in this context hand and head\nshrines featured amongst the veneration and giving of relics.\nFinally, the dissection of corpses for scientific or artistic\nscrutiny had been subject to restrictions imposed by the\nChurch during the Middle Ages. Relieved of these prohibi-\ntions after the Reformation, a new science of anatomy flour-\nished in Protestant contexts such as Calvinist Holland in the\nseventeenth century. It has been suggested that the workings\nof the hand, in particular, engaged Protestant practitioners of\nthis new discipline, as is perhaps reflected in Rembrandt\u2019s\npainting The Anatomy of Dr. Nicolaas Tulp (1632, Mauritshuis,\nThe Hague). In this, a renowned anatomist demonstrates the\nworkings of the muscles and tendons of the flayed left hand\nof a newly executed criminal, convicted of armed robbery.\nThis scene, like all art, is subject to interpretation, but some\npoints may be relevant to the cultural emphasis on the hand\nat this time and relate to similar themes explored above. These\ninclude the fascination with the mechanical workings of the\nhand itself, the instrument with which work (for good or evil)\nis accomplished; greater knowledge of God, since the human\nbody is a product of divine creation; and the redemptive value\nof knowledge gained to the benefit of a whole community\nfrom the excision of an evil-doer (Heckscher 1958; Mitchell\n1994).\nRitual Hand-washing\nOne practice which gave significance to the hands in the\nMiddle Ages was that of ritual ablutions. The washing of the\nhands was concerned with the moral sphere rather than phys-\nical hygiene. The ritual washing of the priest\u2019s hands in the\nMass was seen by varied sections of society on a regular basis.\nThe liturgical Use of Sarum, which was the most extensively\nused in late medieval England, prescribed the handling of the\nritual vessels, the pre- and postconsecrated wafer, and rules\nconcerning the priest\u2019s hands; more accessible versions ex-\nisted, such as the Lay Folk\u2019s Mass Book (Simmons 1879). I\nhave argued elsewhere (Graves 2000a) that this concern with\nwashing the hands was integral to conveying the changing\nnature of the host as the performance of the ritual progressed.\nThe ritual climax of the Mass was the consecration, when\nChrist\u2019s body became immanent in the wafer. After many\npreparatory actions but before the Preface which was the start\nof the consecration, the celebrant\u2019s hands would be washed\n(Frere 1898\u20131901, 76\u201377; Legg 1916, 218). This was intended\nto decontaminate his hands of any pollution prior to his\ntouching the host at the moment of transubstantiation. After\nthe dismissal, the celebrant was to wash his hands again (Lock-\nton 1920, 150). Medieval commentators asserted that this\nablution was not to cleanse the priest after having handled\nthe consecrated host but the opposite. In terms that fulfil\nDouglas\u2019s (1980) analysis of purity and danger, having once\ntouched the sacred, the celebrant\u2019s hands were not allowed\nto touch anything profane until the sacred had been washed\naway, lest remnant traces of the sacred on his hands be pol-\nluted by this contact (Alexander of Hales, Summa Theologica\nIII, 327, quoted in Lockton 1920, 150\u201351; Simmons 1879,\n145).\nGreat concern with passing corrupt matter into the body\nby means of the hands is reflected in the testimony of people\nexamined for heresy in Montaillou, southern France, between\n1318 and 1325 (Ladurie 1984, 142\u201343). For this, albeit his-\ntorically specific, group the practice of toilet was restricted to\n\u201cthose parts of the body which blessed, handled or swallowed\nfood\u2014i.e. the hands, face and mouth\u201d (Ladurie 1984, 142).\nAt the other end of the social scale, medieval courtesy books\nurged boys of the wealthier classes in England to wash their\nface and hands when they arose in the morning and to wash\ntheir hands before meals (Orme 2001, 75). In England, as\nelsewhere, a bowl of water for hand-washing was to be offered\nto an important guest on arrival at a religious or noble house\nas a sign of courtesy, status, and respect (Re\u00b4gnier-Bohler 1995,\n363).\nGesture\nModern anthropology has reinvigorated studies of hand ges-\nture (Enfield 2005). Systems of gesture permeated so many\nspheres of medieval life that Schmitt (1991, 59) has called the\nMiddle Ages a \u201cgestural culture.\u201d Gestures could be bad or\ngood, wicked or virtuous, as they contributed to the fashion-\ning of wicked or virtuous subjects (Asad 1987; Camille 2002,\n154\u201355; Schmitt 1989, 136\u201337). Some everyday insulting ges-\ntures can be re-created from visual images and literary and\nlegal references. At least four gestures of contempt involving\nthe thumb and mouth were known on the Continent before\nthe sixteenth century and had been introduced to England\nby that time (Jones 2002, 79\u201381). The finger in the mouth\nand a range of grins or grimaces also denoted foolishness,\nstupidity, or derision (Jones 2002, 114\u201315). In the early mod-\nern period, gestures and insulting actions were related to a\ncomplex nexus of disputed discourses, including seniority,\ngender, dependency, and honour, but boxing the ears, spitting\nin the face, slapping the face, pulling the beard or hair, and\nattacking neck-bands and neck-ruffs were amongst the most\ncommon and prevalent (Shepard 2003, 140\u201351; Gowing 2003;\nWells 2004).\nThe kiss of peace within the Mass, in theory, created a com-\nmunity of equals. In practice, however, in England people in\nmany later medieval communities avoided kissing each other\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 45\nand instead used a special board or tablet (pax board) which\ncould be passed round and kissed. The order in which the pax\nwas received was perceived as reflecting a social hierarchy and\ncould therefore be a catalyst for dispute and social fragmen-\ntation rather than Christian unity (Bossy 1987, 69\u201370).\nThe language of gesture in fourteenth-century art and of\nthe \u201cspeaking hand\u201d in particular has been the subject of\nintensive analysis by Barasch (1987). The power of this anal-\nysis is that it identifies the origins of these gestures in con-\ntemporary church ritual and judicial procedures which would\nhave had an audience across the social spectrum. The idea\nthat hand gestures \u201ccould form a comprehensive system of\ncommunication that might be called \u2018language\u2019\u201d was explicitly\nformulated in the early years of the seventeenth century\n(Knowlson 1965). In 1644, an English physician, John Bulwer,\npublished his Chirologia: Or the Naturall Language of the\nHand. For Bulwer (1644, 1\u20132, quoted in Barasch 1987, 2) the\nhand was another mouth: \u201cthe Hand, that busie instrument,\nis most talkative, whose language is as easily perceived and\nunderstood as if Man had another mouth or fountaine of\ndiscourse in his Hand.\u201d In the present context Bulwer\u2019s work\nraises two points. First, in the period immediately preceding\nthe Commonwealth, the role of the hands as a primary cul-\ntural medium was acknowledged in certain intellectual circles.\nSecond, Bulwer was associated with the Royalist Laudian\nparty. This was the party that supported the use of elaborate\nceremony, vestments, and veneration in the rituals of the\nChurch of England, seen by opponents such as the Puritans\nas akin to the reintroduction of Catholicism, and that largely\nsupported the king when the Civil War of the 1640s in En-\ngland set the king against Parliament, led by Oliver Cromwell.\nConsequently, Bulwer\u2019s attitudes could have been subject to\nthe same violent rejection that other aspects of the Established\nChurch suffered in the late 1640s and \u201950s. Liturgical gesture\nwas certainly seen as part and parcel of Laudian religious\npractice and was despised by the religious radicals: kneeling,\nbowing, any form of lowering or uncovering the head, the\nsigning of the cross, or making a benediction were anathema\nto them (Cressy 1999).\nCourtesy and conduct books were produced primarily for\neducating the male children of the gentry, describing body\ndiscipline, hygiene, gesture, and elite concepts of manners\n(Bryson 1998). The earlier seventeenth century was a period\nin which reverence and deference were shown by bodily dis-\nposition and gesture not only in Royalist court and church\ncircles and amongst the gentry but also, if in far less codified\nand recorded ways, in ordinary homes and workshops be-\ntween servant and master or mistress, between children and\ntheir elders, and between apprentices and masters (cf. Gold-\nberg 1999; Brooks 1994, 53; Gowing 2003, 7, 58\u201365). In En-\ngland children were expected to kneel as a gesture of sub-\nmission before their parents to ask for a blessing in the\nmorning (Stone 1979, 122). Hat-doffing was the norm be-\ntween males of inferior and superior rank and between male\njuniors and elders in many institutions (Cressy 1999, 35\u201336;\nBryson 1998, 88\u201389, 93\u201394; Stone 1979, 122\u201323). Infringe-\nments of these prerogatives denoted rebellion and insult. To\nstrike off the hat was one of the commonest forms of hu-\nmiliating insult used in male encounters in the early modern\nperiod, as it imposed a gesture of subordination on the one\nwhose hat was dislodged (Shepard 2003, 145; Ruff 2001, 123).\nA similar though differently nuanced practice concerned hon-\nour and insult amongst women. The tangible symbol of mar-\nried status for a woman in the seventeenth century was the\nhead-covering: to have it forcibly removed during a fight\nevoked the dependency of a servant or the shame of a whore\n(Gowing 2003, 58). Slapping the face was symbolic of the\ndisciplinary rights that masters had over male servants and\napprentices as well as younger male relatives and that mis-\ntresses of households had over female servants in particular\n(Brooks 1994, 144; Hanawalt 2000, 208\u201314; Gowing 2003).\nTo use it out of these contexts projected servility onto the\nrecipient. Gestures of deference pervaded most domestic con-\ntexts in the early to mid-seventeenth century but in religious\ncontexts evoked disputed religious practices. Thus gesture\nmade the body an area of contesting disciplines and ideologies\nin this period.\nDress, Body-fashioning, and the Significance of Clothing\nClothes were the central material markers of identity in the\nearly modern world (Jones and Stallybrass 2000). Many as-\npects of medieval and early modern dress (e.g., sumptuary\nlaws, livery, significance of types of cloth) have been the sub-\nject of academic study, but an anthropology of what was\nemphasized at any one point and why has yet to be attempted.\nHere just a few aspects are explored.\nAs in many societies, the attention given to the head\nthrough dress, head ornamentation, and hair practices sig-\nnaled certain social distinctions (cf. Bartlett 1994; Hiltebeitel\n1998). Moreover, theologians put a religious gloss on much\nof the evidence. For Thomas Aquinas, a crown was a symbol\nof royalty, but its circular form was also a sign of perfection\n(Minnis 1997, 121). One of the external signs of priestly or-\ndination was the tonsure, which, however, also provided a\nreference point for marks of infamy and humiliation. Ac-\ncording to the fifteenth-century Liber Albus, brothel-keepers\nof both sexes in London might be given a tonsure as pun-\nishment, as was a common whore if caught for her third\noffence (Jones 2002, 103\u20134). Fools\u2019 heads might be shaved\ninto multiple tonsures or shaved completely, and fools were\nalso signified by the wearing of cocks\u2019 combs on the head,\nass-eared hoods, and hoods with a phallic appearance (Jones\n2002, 103\u20136, 109). Pieces of paper pinned to the cap or paper\nhats or mitres inscribed with the crimes of the malefactor\nwere an integral part of punishment in both the late medieval\nand early modern periods (Jones 2002, 87; Cressy 1999, 28).\nConstable (1985) has reviewed the sometimes contradictory\nmeanings of beards in the Middle Ages. The beard, or at least\nthe ability to grow one, was regarded as a symbol of manliness,\n46 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\nvirility, and potency. The absence of a beard therefore required\nexplanation, for example, either as a symbolic component of\na clerical or religious way of life or as a sign of weakness,\neffeminacy, or sterility. However, the texts cannot tell us about\nthe prevalence or otherwise of real beards on real men. Cum-\nberpatch (2006) suggests that ceramic vessels with anthro-\npomorphic faces and nearly always beards of the later eleventh\nto mid-fifteenth century may have been connected with rites\nof passage for boys coming of age or with feasting and drink-\ning related to fertility (e.g., weddings and harvests). Fisher\n(2001) argues that in early modern England beards became\na central aspect of the elite Renaissance male and that the\nbeard was so important that boys may have been regarded as\na distinct gender between the mid-sixteenth and the mid-\nseventeenth century but that manipulations of gender sig-\nnaling were possible on the theatrical stage and elsewhere\nthrough the use of prosthetic beards.\nThe hands were distinguished by rings to denote marriage,\nwealth, feudal and familial alliance, and authority (usually by\nseal rings). So important was the ring in certain contexts that\nthe custom arose of wearing the ring over gloves; some gloves\nwere made with slits to allow rings to be seen through them\n(Norris 1999, 90\u201391). Gloves were expensive and were a fa-\nvoured high-status gift. Norris (pp. 93\u201394) has identified 16\npoints of etiquette and ritual respecting glove wearing that\nwere current amongst the elite throughout the Middle Ages\nup to the end of the sixteenth century\u2014more than for any\nother single item of clothing. These included the issuing of\nchallenges and insults and also favour, homage, and deference.\nA whole semiotic system evolved around the wearing or re-\nmoving of gloves in different contexts. In the sixteenth and\nseventeenth centuries gloves, handkerchiefs, and hand-held\nfans were material props in the highly stylized self-represen-\ntation of elite married women. They also mapped cultural\nanxieties about courtship and marriage, and new gloves were\noften distributed to guests and friends on the day of a gentry\nwedding (Green 2000; Cressy 1997, 216, 362). The throwing\ndown of the gauntlet, although cliche\u00b4d in European historical\nmemory, was an elite act of defiance.\nSome have argued that there were fundamental changes in\nbody discourse in Western cultures between the fifteenth and\nseventeenth centuries. Vigarello (1989), Muir (1997), and\nKleinschmidt (2000, 76\u201388) claim that by the sixteenth cen-\ntury a new perception of the body had emerged, and new\ntechniques of the body came into being that focused mainly\non the upper body\u2014its discipline, flexibility, and agility in\npractices such as fencing and dancing. Upper-body strength\nas a marker of distinction and beauty in the male elite in the\nlater Middle Ages gave way to an emphasis on deportment,\ngracefulness in movement, and suppleness in the sixteenth\nand seventeenth centuries, together with the idea of civility\nin conduct (Bryson 1998). These ideas were propagated\nthrough bodily practices and literature on deportment which\nbecame far more prescriptive than had previously been the\ncase (Vigarello 1989, 156; Muir 1997, 117\u201346). The limitation\nof these arguments is the extent to which they refer to limited\nsocial groups. Discipline extended, through bodily practices,\nto the mind and disposition. It is uncertain how far Stone\u2019s\n(1979) assertion that punishment for children increased in\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries stands up to scrutiny\n(cf. Orme 2001, 85). \u201cControlled\u201d beating or whipping was\nadvocated in the Middle Ages but not to excess (Shahar 1990,\n109\u201311, 173\u201375 190, 194). It was intended to improve the\nchild: \u201cto chastise\u201d was \u201cto make chaste or pure\u201d (Orme 2001,\n84). The increase in the number of schools in the postmedieval\nperiod may have extended the experience of corporal pun-\nishment. The English Poor Laws of the sixteenth and early\nseventeenth centuries physically marked and regulated the\nbodies of the poor in new, intensive ways and subjected the\nbodies of many unmarried women to unprecedented physical\nsearches (Gowing 2003, 40\u201347).\nBy the early seventeenth century, dress and deportment\nhad become an aspect of partisan religious and political iden-\ntity: crudely juxtaposed, this pitted Royalist flamboyance and\nlewdness against Puritan simplicity and sobriety. Colour and\nlace were measured against simplicity, where \u201cplainness\u201d\ncould become a measure of human value and worth to Pu-\nritans. This had a corollary in the relative exposure and fram-\ning of neck and head, arms and hands; the culturally loaded\nsemiotics of hat-wearing have been mentioned above. Some\nurban trade guilds tried to impose dress legislation, some of\nit focusing specifically on head and neck apparel, on their\napprentices in this period, but they had limited success be-\ncause this apparel provided the apprentices with a means to\nassert their individuality and defy their masters (Mackenzie\n1827, 666). How the body was framed in the 1640s\u2013\u201950s was\nneither incidental nor a whim of fashion.\nAn Anthropological Context for\nthe Treachery of Images\nWhilst the destruction and removal of images was encouraged\nby key reformers in Europe and by state decree in England,\nthe systematic attacks suggest more than the agency of central\nauthority. Aston (1989) has made a distinction between public\nand private acts of iconoclasm. It is my contention that the\nform and context of these actions elucidate an aspect of the\nrelationship between ordinary people and images that has not\nbeen recorded or explicitly verbalized because it formed part\nof popular thinking rather than a theological argument or\nstate directive. This is not to reconstitute a two-tiered model\nof the Reformation (learned elites versus unschooled popu-\nlace) or to deny theological understanding, intent, and piety\nto ordinary people\u2019s actions but rather to postulate a further\ndimension to their motives. Clearly some iconoclasm was\ntheologically motivated; some no doubt had its precedents in\nmedieval Carnival, in which the normal social and religious\nhierarchies were inverted and uncontrolled riot\u2014derisive and\ndestructive behaviour\u2014was tolerated for a season. In the fol-\nlowing I propose a hitherto unexplored motivation from\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 47\nwithin an otherwise orthodox community. It is not intended\nto explain all occurrences. The argument rests on a material-\nculture aspect of the relationships between people, saints, and\nimages and the medieval contexts of gift giving.\nThe doctrine of the communion of saints bound together\nthe living and the dead as a community of believers who\nhelped one another in preparation for the day of judgement\n(Morrill 2001, 25). The living were engaged in constant prayer\nfor their dead kin, patrons, and allies. Duffy\u2019s analysis of\nmedieval miracle tales argues that such supplication was re-\ngarded as semi-contractual (1993, 185). The Church circu-\nlated exempla to warn the laity of the saintly wrath and pun-\nishment they would incur if they reneged on their obligations\nunder the contract, and the laity were equally capable of feel-\ning aggrieved if the saints did not fulfil theirs. Generations\nhad contributed bequests to the same images, for painting,\nclothing, lights, housings, vestments, and cloths for the altars\ndedicated to them, and to the priests who served them. I have\nargued that these practices had resonances for a wide social\nspectrum by the sixteenth century (Graves 2000a). Cloth and\nclothing, in particular, played a central role in the European\nand English economies of the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies.\nCloth not only had a commodity value but was circulated\nand recycled as clothing in a number of spheres which gave\nit other equally important social and economic values (cf.\nKopytoff 1986). This can be seen most conspicuously in the\nlate medieval and early modern institution of livery, \u201cwhereby\npeople were paid for their services not in cash but in goods,\nespecially clothing\u201d (Jones and Stallybrass 2000, 4). Marked\nclothing proclaimed the identity of the aristocratic or gentry\nemployer through specific colours, heraldic badges, armorials,\nor other personal ciphers. It also, thereby, proclaimed the\nidentity of the wearer as a servant of the patron. In addition,\ncraft and trade guilds often required their members to wear\nguild livery in public processions, at guild courts, and at fra-\nternal feasts and funerals. Unmarked clothing could also be\ngiven as a form of non-monetary payment with the under-\nstanding that it formed part of a livery and maintenance\nagreement or apprenticeship indenture or as part-wages for\ndomestic service or other wage work (Goldberg 1999; Gowing\n2003, 32). \u201cLivery was a form of incorporation, a material\nmnemonic that inscribed obligations and indebtedness upon\nthe body. As cloth exchanged hands, it bound people in net-\nworks of obligation\u201d (Jones and Stallybrass 2000, 20). Finally,\ncloth and clothing were the principal non-ephemeral items\nin gift giving as a mediating practice in the discourse of social\npatronage outside the institution of formal livery and formed\na large component of charitable giving to the poor. As have\nother seminal studies of the gift (Mauss 1954), contemporary\nevidence shows that participants were bound in formidable\nnetworks of mutual debt and obligation (Crawford 2004;\nSweetinburgh 2004).\nFrom this perspective, by the frequent gifts of cloth and\nclothing to their favoured saints and the clergy who served\nthem early-sixteenth-century people were offering support\nand maintenance which created mutual obligations. The pop-\nular feeling was that, in return, the saint was obliged to answer\nprayers and requests. It is interesting to consider where the\npower balance was perceived to lie. Would these donors not\nhave been entitled to think of themselves as the patrons? The\ncommunion of saints seems to have been partially under-\nstood, if not sealed, in the terms and material culture of these\npractices.\nFrom this perspective, when the intercessionary power of\nsaints and images was denounced in the process of Refor-\nmation, there must have been an enormous sense of religious,\nemotional, and social betrayal amongst some portions of the\npopulation. These might have been people of many ranks\nwho experienced livery and incorporation in their own lives\nand who had even contributed singly or collectively for cloth\nand clothing for a saint\u2019s image, the dressing of a saint\u2019s altar,\nor the provision of the liturgical cloths required to maintain\nthe rituals at the altar or in connection with the image. They\nwould have represented a potentially large proportion cer-\ntainly of the artisanal class and middling sort\u2014those from\nwhose ranks many iconoclasts are believed to have come.\nWhatever religious reforms iconoclasm enacted, the form of\nthe enactment resonates with an understanding of social be-\ntrayal in the context of both livery and gift-giving practices.\nThe punishment meted out to images surely tells us that some\npeople felt both a personal and social institutional sense of\nbetrayal: petty treason, as between a master and a servant or\napprentice or between the head of a household and his de-\npendents, but treason nonetheless.\nThe increased occurrence of capital punishment, particu-\nlarly for treason, provided the \u201cvocabulary\u201d with which those\nfeeling betrayed on these grounds could enact vehement at-\ntacks on the bodies of images. If a row of two-dimensional\nsaints painted on a chancel screen could not be individually\nburnt or hanged, it could nonetheless be \u201ckilled\u201d or executed\nby striking the body parts which were most socially significant\nand which were the most frequent objects of judicial punish-\nment: the head and the hands. In this context we may also\nunderstand why, after some public image-breaking, the crowd\ntook fragments from the broken images home with them to\nenact private retribution on them (Aston 1993, 307).\nConclusions\nThis paper has sought to build towards an aspect of body\ndiscourse by extrapolating from practices inflicted on images\nrather than practices represented by images. Heads and hands\nof images were removed whether the saint or religious persona\nrepresented was male or female, young or old, religious or\nlay, mother or virgin (or both). Thus although our modern\nunderstanding of the cultural constructions of bodies in his-\ntory is alert to complex nuances according to wealth, gender,\nlife-course, status, and other socially constructed concepts,\nthere remains an observed consistency in the corpus of sur-\n48 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\nviving evidence to be explained. This is not to argue that there\nwas only one dominant discourse of \u201cthe body\u201d sustained by\nnormative texts and practices when, clearly, body discourse\nand corporeal experience varied enormously, but it does re-\nquire us to seek answers for the observed phenomena.\nWhat gave the archaeological pattern meaning in the past?\nI have tried to construct an argument, drawing upon both\nthe written record and other forms of material culture, for\nways in which heads and hands were accorded significance\nin the period. I have argued that some iconoclasts of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries treated images in the way\nthat bodies would have been treated in circumstances of cap-\nital and corporal punishment. The selective attack on the\nheads and hands of images was predicated on cultural un-\nderstandings of these features as signifying more of the life-\nforce than other parts of the body. The potency of these\nfeatures was borne out, reproduced, and reinforced through\nthe social practices of a wide range of discourses\u2014sometimes\ncommon to an equally wide range of subjects, sometimes\nparticular to a specific few\u2014which gave the head and the\nhands priority and heightened importance. These practices\nincluded religious and secular rituals, systems of gesture and\ndeportment, and both the physical composition of clothing\nand its role in the construction of social identity. From this\nperspective, iconoclasm can contribute to an anthropological\nunderstanding of bodies in this historical period.\nCan any differences be seen between sixteenth-century and\nseventeenth-century iconoclasm? I would contend that read-\ning the retribution on images as socially understood appro-\npriate punishment for crimes against both the individual and\nthe collective of believers helps us to understand not only a\nfurther aspect of body discourse but an anthropological aspect\nof religious practice. The contexts of the exchange of clothes\ncreated a social understanding within which relationships with\nsaints and images were embodied. I argue that the particular\nform of destruction also adds a dimenstion of social justice\nor cultural appropriateness to iconoclasm. In this I have, in\nWandel\u2019s (1995, 11) words, tried to \u201cexcavate the meaning of\nacts\u201d of people who did not necessarily have control over\nmore protected and conventional forms of communication\u2014\nthe treatise, the pamphlet, the sermon, the propaganda image.\nThe immediacy of involvement with images may explain\nmuch of the fury of the popular iconoclasm of the sixteenth\ncentury.\nBy the mid-seventeenth century, however, there was little\ncontinuity in public reverence for images. Religious icono-\nclasm in the early 1640s was both commissioned by the state\nand undertaken by soldiers in less controlled circumstances\n(Morrill 2001). The recent installations of Laudian worship\nwere as much the target as surviving traces of those late me-\ndieval practices which were regarded as idolatrous. Most com-\nmentators consider seventeenth-century iconoclasm to have\nbeen more encompassing, also targeting monuments to the\ndead which included any hint of Catholic belief in prayer\nformulae (Cooper 2001). The sense of active personal betrayal,\ntherefore, was absent. The passage of time had allowed the\nidentity of the nation itself with Protestantism to become\nmore concrete. The treachery of idolatrous practices could be\nseen far more in relation to a communion of the realm than\na communion of saints. The Civil War challenged even that\ncommunion and unleashed an attack on the \u201cpassive re-\nminders of [a] discredited theology\u201d (Morrill 2001, 26). After\nthese purges, and lacking any more available images, religious\nviolence continued in the later seventeenth century when ef-\nfigies\u2014or substitute bodies\u2014of hated figures (e.g., the pope,\nthe Whore of Babylon, or the perpetrators of the Popish Plot)\nwere specially made in order to be burnt in public bonfires\n(Cressy 1999, 24\u201325). Nevertheless, if an image could not be\nremoved or destroyed in toto, the targets of attack in the\nseventeenth century continued to be heads and hands. It is\nthe contention of this paper that the head and the hands\ncontinued to denote the highest association with the life-force,\nsupported by a raft of social practices which emphasized this\nimportance. The punishment unleashed on them still bore a\nrelation to these factors and reflected an age of contested\nbodily deference and discipline. It was an age in which it was\nperhaps more obvious for the gestures and framing of the\nbody itself to betray religious and political allegiance than had\nbeen true in the 1530s and \u201940s. In a period in which the\nword came to represent the ideological cynosure of political\nand religious thinking, it would repay further study to con-\nsider how other, alternative ways of speaking were made pos-\nsible through bodies and their actions.\nAcknowledgments\nI offer thanks, with fond memories, to my colleagues at the\nformer City of Lincoln Archaeology Unit, now the Post-Ex-\ncavation Team within the Heritage Team, Directorate of De-\nvelopment and Environmental Services, City of Lincoln\nCouncil, and special thanks to Jenny Mann.

Funari\nDepartment of History and Center for Strategic Studies, State\nUniversity of Campinas, C. Postal 6110, Campinas, SP, 13081-\n970, Brazil (ppfunari@uol.com.br). 9 IX 07\nTwo features are most salient in Graves\u2019s paper: the use of\nsocial theory for the understanding of archaeological evidence\nand the role of deep-rooted historical mores and ethos in\nexplaining the past. Iconoclasm and attacks on images are\nusually dealt with using theological discussions as background\nor direct explanations of the social practices involved. Graves\nprefers to use anthropological models, emphasizing the plu-\nrality, diversity, and fluidity of social identities (cf. Jones\n1997). Gestures are thus part of religious communities\u2019 dif-\nferentiation, opposing, in the case of early modern England,\nCatholic, various Protestant, and other religiosities. Further-\nmore, popular identities are opposed to elite Weltanschau-\nungen, the former interested in contrasting power relations\nand the latter prone to defend the status quo. Contrary to\nthe official damnatio memoriae of Roman times, popular icon-\noclasm was aimed at authorities in general and Church ex-\nempla in particular. The occurrence of concepts such as dis-\ncipline and bodily practices suggests the influence of Foucault\nand Bourdieu, but Graves stresses her use of a plethora of\nspecific studies such as Vigarello (1989) and Kleinschmidt\n(2000). Social theory is thus mostly used through historical\nstudies. Historical context is put at the center of the argument.\nAgency and the limits of normative interpretive models and\nprescriptive historical documents are dealt with again in the\nvery specific historical Reformation and Counter-Reforma-\ntion context. Giddens is used to understand historicity.\nIt is natural, then, that Graves\u2019s arguments pay special at-\ntention to the histrorical, medieval roots of religiosity in En-\ngland (Johnson 2005), particularly as the destruction of im-\nages is placed in the context of the Reformation\u2019s official\nanti-Catholic royal policy. The later-medieval perceptions of\nsainthood, described by Graves as \u201canimistic veneration and\nsuperstitious practices,\u201d are perhaps a deep-rooted popular\nunderstanding of the sacred, as Aron Gurevich (1988) ob-\nserved. Medieval associations with body (corpus) and head\n(caput), as well as hands (manus) and face (facies), are related\nto society as a whole, and the procession of Corpus Christi\nis taken as a good example of the relationship between the\nimagery of society and of the body (cf. Funari 1993). In the\ndetailed study of iconoclasm, Graves is keen to emphasize the\ndiversity of social groups and attitudes, as discourse and ex-\nperience varied enormously. She clearly denies normative\ncompliance. Her overall conclusion is a tentative one, again\ngrounded in the historicity of cultural understandings: some\niconoclasts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries treated\nimages in the way that bodies would have been treated in\npunishment. More than that, the appeal of iconoclasm was\nrooted in its direct, popular character, as opposed to upper-\nclass conventional media. She stresses both the variety of per-\nceptions and the overall difference between ordinary and\nscholarly expressions. Archaeology is taken as a way of ac-\ncessing people\u2019s feelings, particularly those reflecting contra-\ndictions and social conflict.\nThe most challenging issue raised by Graves is how to put\ntogether anthropological and historical interpretive models,\nmodern and postmodern epistemologies. The fluid provi-\nsional and contradictory identities of social agents complicate\nthe study of the construction of social identity, but Graves\nright from the start does not aim at proving that her inter-\npretation is the only possible one. She succeeds, however, in\nconvincing the reader that material culture does not depend\non the written record and that historicity and culture are key\nto an understanding of iconoclasm in England. These are no\nmean achievements, and others, studying different subjects,\nwill profit from her epistemological outlook.\nM. H. Johnson\nDepartment of Archaeology, University of Southampton,\nAvenue Campus, Highfield, Southampton SO17 1BF, UK\n(m.h.johnson@soton.ac.uk). 6 VIII 07\nGraves has written a paper of the first significance whose\nargument and conclusions are important and timely. Hith-\nerto, too much of the literature on sixteenth and seventeenth-\ncentury iconoclasm, even where it has been anthropologically\ninformed, has framed itself as a contribution to religious and\ntheological history or to the political narrative of the time.\nGraves shows us how a comparative anthropology, when com-\nbined with a stress on materiality and material culture, adds\nan essential dimension to the understanding of iconoclasm.\nIn approaching iconoclasm in this way, Graves shows us\nhistorical actors behaving not as mindless vandals, on the one\nhand, or as robots following a formal Protestant agenda, on\nthe other. Instead, they act as social agents in their own right,\noperating against a backdrop or habitus of late-medieval val-\nues and assumptions (the importance of the head and hands,\nthe \u201ccontract\u201d between saint\/image and laity) and making\ntheir own history in the process. After 30 years of agency\ntheory, this may seem a very basic point to make, but it\nremains an important and valuable one.\nIn the process, Graves raises some difficult and important\ninterpretive questions, of which I will pursue only one. Graves\nis working here on the cusp of history, archaeology, and an-\nthropology. She is right to stress the way her argument op-\nerates at the level of folk practice and understanding rather\nthan formal doctrinal belief and fully justified in asserting\nthat it should be evaluated against the evidence of the pat-\nterning of material culture rather than what an elite minority\n50 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\nof contemporaries chose to scribble down\u2014in other words,\nthe stuff of traditional documentary history. However, I would\nask her to dwell a little more on the way acting upon the\nmaterial world in the form of iconoclasm was refracted\nthrough social class and literacy.\nThe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in England and\nEurope were, among many other things, a period of class\npolarization, and this polarization was linked to the changing\nsocial configuration of the practice of reading and writing.\nThe older Marxist accounts of the end of feudalism and the\n\u201crise of the middle classes\u201d may have been revised, but class\nformation and its relationship, via literacy, to changing forms\nof knowledge and power remain at the heart of all theoretically\nreputable understandings of the period. This being the case,\nI would suggest that a more complex and nuanced picture\nneeds to be drawn than simply a documentary record of elite\ndoctrinal and political impulse on the one hand and a material\nrecord of popular or folk understandings on the other.\nLiteracy and, more specifically, the practice of reading and\nwriting and the way the spread of that practice was refracted\nthrough status, class, and gender and through the seculari-\nzation of education changed the way people thought and felt\nabout the world. In particular, following the lead of Goody\n(1987) and to some extent Sharpe (2000), I suggest that it\nchanged the way people thought and felt about material things\nsuch as icons and images. The religious changes of the six-\nteenth and seventeenth centuries had iconoclasm as one\nsymptom and a rising level of literacy as another. Neither\narchaeology nor history is adequately placed on its own to\ngrasp this decisive transition, since it is about the relationship\nbetween the actions and processes that produced the records\nof both.\nTo clarify at the risk of oversimplification: a sixteenth-cen-\ntury peasant may well have inhabited the mental world that\nGraves describes, and iconoclasm, for him, was an appropriate\nreaction for the reasons Graves delineates. But his other re-\nactions, as I have argued elsewhere (Johnson 1996; 2007,\n152\u201361), may well have been to engage in other patterns of\neconomic and cultural practice, including, for example, new\nagricultural practices that might be described as \u201ccapitalistic\u201d\nand the sending of his son to grammar school to learn to\nread and write. For his son, then, there were other ways of\nunderstanding the world than through the \u201cgestural culture\u201d\nreferred to by Graves, and history shows that such young men\nwere not slow in appropriating and exploiting those new cul-\ntural resources.\nFor Graves\u2019s argument to be complete, then, it needs some\naccount of changing levels and patterns of literacy in this\nperiod and the way those changes related to changing patterns\nof social class and gender. A full account of such would be\na tall order and a \u201ccomplete\u201d argument in a period of such\ndense scholarship and abundant data something of a chimera,\nbut some brief comment on this topic would be welcome.\nCharles E. Orser Jr.\nResearch and Collections Division, New York State\nMuseum, 3140 Cultural Education Center, Albany, NY\n12230, U.S.A. (corser@mail.nysed.gov). 30 IX 07\nGraves\u2019s case study in the archaeology of iconoclasm repre-\nsents another important step in the maturation of historical\narchaeology. As she works to push the discipline farther into\nthe realm of anthropological scholarship, she demonstrates\nits multidisciplinary power. She shows how seemingly random\nindividual actions (here the partial destruction of human im-\nages) mask cultural manifestations of a deeper mentality. At\nthe most explicit scale she pursues a line of inquiry that teases\nout a likely meaning for the destruction of anthropomorphic\nimages in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England. The\nthoroughness of her scholarship provides a convincing and\nenlightening case study.\nFirst, Graves\u2019s explicit assertion that her article is not just\nanother Eurocentric exercise should not be overlooked. Read-\ners unfamiliar with historical archaeology may be surprised\nthat she must offer this disclaimer. If one is a scholar of\nhistoric England, must one be Eurocentric by definition? Are\nall anthropologists of Europe inherently Eurocentric because\nof their chosen field of study? These are philosophical ques-\ntions that anthropologists would seemingly be able to answer\nwith ease. To clarify the situation in historical archaeology,\nhowever, it must be noted that it has become something of\na mantra among some historical archaeologists working out-\nside the developed world to argue\u2014sometimes covertly, often\nmore openly\u2014that archaeologists of post-Columbian Euro-\npean history necessarily pursue a Eurocentric agenda. Obvi-\nously cognizant of this possible charge, Graves feels compelled\nto defend herself at the outset even though she is a widely\nrespected authority on her subject. Her need to distance her-\nself from Eurocentrism to a broad readership outside England\nis a sorry commentary on how far global historical archae-\nology has yet to travel to become truly accepted as an an-\nthropological pursuit. Whether we like it or not, the many\ndiverse nations and peoples of Europe (itself a historical con-\nstruct) helped to shape our modern world. To ignore the\noppression and repression they wrought in the world and,\nindeed, to gloss over their sometimes well-intended but mis-\nguided attempts to \u201craise\u201d indigenous peoples is to overlook\na significant part of our shared global history. Even the es-\nteemed anthropologist Jack Goody (2006), in a recent critique\nof the Eurocentric agenda (but not specifically directed toward\nresearch in and about Europe), has considerable difficulty\ncompletely removing Europe from global history. Even when\nChina ruled the commercial world with its porcelains and\nsilks, it traded these commodities to the eager residents of\nEuropean city-states first in the Mediterranean and then\nelsewhere.\nEqually significant is Graves\u2019s comment that her analysis\ncannot necessarily be proven with historical records. This\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 51\npoint raises another hot issue for historical archaeologists and\nperhaps is more acutely noticed in Britain than in the United\nStates. American historical archaeologists who have intellec-\ntually matured on a diet of historically rooted cultural an-\nthropology fully appreciate the close epistemological links be-\ntween history and anthropology. In Britain, however, the\nintellectual schism between social anthropology and archae-\nology\u2014which some scholars are working to mend\u2014has\nmeant in a practical way that the tradition of British archae-\nology is distinct from that of its American cousin. Even the\nterm for the field in Britain, \u201cpost-medieval archaeology,\u201d\nevokes the tradition in which it has emerged. The English\nhistorical archaeologist Matthew Johnson (2007) has explored\nthis intellectual history as it pertains to the scholarship of\nlocal history in Britain and concretely outlined its impact on\nthe archaeology of recent history.\nAs a further line of inquiry it would be interesting to know\nwhether and how contemporary osteological specimens con-\nform to Graves\u2019s thesis. For example, in a recent study of the\nuse of black bodies as cadavers in Dallas, Texas, during the\nearly twentieth century, James Davidson (2007) found that\nsome of the skeletons were missing their lower arms and\nhands. The sociohistorical and cultural setting of the Dallas\nskeletons is much different from the focus of Graves\u2019s study,\nbut the similarities are striking nonetheless. The apparent\nconsistency exposed in the disparities of time and place may\npresent a fruitful line of additional inquiry.\nThe Dallas information also makes one wonder about the\ncontinuity of dismemberment through time and the contin-\nuation of its symbolism. The contextual information for six-\nteenth- and seventeenth-century England is so rich that\nGraves can explore the broader anthropological implications\nthat link the destruction of images with questions of punish-\nment and torture, but a more cross-culturally sensitive, pan-\ntemporal analysis also appears to represent a rich area of\nfuture research.\nJes Wienberg\nDepartment of Archaeology and Ancient History, Lund\nUniversity, Box 117, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden\n(jes.wienberg@ark.lu.se). 24 IX 07\nIn 1793 the former French king Louis XVI was guillotined in\nParis. The same year the cathedral of the town, Notre Dame,\nwas exposed to a violent iconoclasm in which the biblical\nkings on the western facade were beheaded. The crowd be-\nlieved that the statues represented the French kings. Thus\nduring the French Revolution there was a clear-cut parallel\nbetween the execution of people and the vandalism of sculp-\ntures symbolizing the ancien re\u00b4gime: Off with their heads!\nGraves demonstrates a correlation between body culture,\npunishment, and vandalism during the Reformation in En-\ngland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It was the\nmost important body parts\u2014head and hands\u2014that were\npunished for extreme crimes that were attacked during this\nperiod. Her article is a brilliant example of historical archae-\nology unifying different disciplines and fields of research\u2014\nanthropology, history, and archaeology, body culture, law, and\nreligious imagery. The examples are convincing, and the ar-\ngument ought to inspire new investigations employing its\nquestions and methods.\nEngland is described by Graves as well suited for such\ninvestigation because of the intensity of the Reformation. In\nScandinavia the Reformation was milder and more pragmatic,\nand I do not see all of the same tendencies as she does in\nEngland. Catholic imagery was to a great extent accepted by\nthe Lutheran reformers, and many medieval altars and sculp-\ntures are preserved in churches and museums. Only a handful\nof instances of iconoclasm are known. The Catholic Poul\nHelgesen describes an attack in 1531 on the imagery in the\nchurch of Our Lady in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark:\n\u201cFirst they overthrowed all the imagery of saints, spitted on\nthem, beated them with their fists and mocked them with\ndreadful invectives, while they smashed them with axes.\u201d Fur-\nthermore, in 1534 everything divine in the church was made\n\u201csilient\u201d (Frederiksen 1987, 117; Bolvig 1996, 96). The de-\nscription of the 1531 event has been considered overstated\nand untrustworthy (e.g., Bolvig 1996, 97). However, what is\ndescribed is an attack on images as if they were living people\nwho had failed, in accordance with the examples from En-\ngland and Graves\u2019s interpretation of them. Catholic wooden\nsculptures appear to have often been burned. The Lutheran\nbishop Peder Palladius wrote in his visitation book in the\n1540s that pilgrimage imagery \u201cshould be taken away and\nburnt\u201d (Frederiksen 1987, 112). This was what also happened\nto witches, according to Graves.\nA survey of the Romanesque and Gothic sculpture in Scan-\ndinavia does not, however, reveal any traces of selective van-\ndalism. Medieval stone sculpture is often intact except for\nnatural disintegration. Medieval wooden sculpture is also well\npreserved in many cases. The national museums of Scandi-\nnavia do have rooms, now and then, called \u201chospital de-\npartments,\u201d of sculptures that lack some part of the body.\nHeads are usually preserved, while an arm or a leg of a crucifix,\nor the arms and hands of a seated Madonna, apostle, or bishop\nsaint are missing. Rather than selective vandalism this reflects\nthe fact that arms and hands were more easily broken off or\nloosened under rough treatment since the Reformation.\nReply\nI am grateful to all of the contributors both for their ex-\npressions of support and for indicating areas for further ex-\nploration and necessary consideration.\nWienberg has drawn attention to a different response to\nthe Reformation in much of Lutheran Scandinavia, in which\n52 Current Anthropology Volume 49, Number 1, February 2008\nthe selective destruction I have suggested for England was\nlargely absent. Whilst reviewing the patterns of iconoclasm\nin England I was aware of both similarities and contrasts in\nCalvinist Scotland and in Lutheran countries. There is ob-\nviously scope for a much wider survey and analysis of Ref-\normation and Counter-Reformation attitudes and actions to-\nwards the materiality of images across Europe. This study\nwould examine patterns of iconoclasm, tolerance of images,\nand the active promotion of images, on the one hand, and\nwhitewashing or concealment of images in compliance with\nstate regulation carried out in the covert hope of future re-\ncovery, on the other (Duffy 1992, 583; Tarlow 2003). Given\nthe range of theological, political, and social responses to the\nReformation, it is to be expected that there will be variety in\npatterning in different countries and different regions. Con-\ntextual analysis of iconoclasm and image toleration can pro-\nvide rich understanding of diversity in levels of orthodox\nunderstanding and relations between Reformation, social\nstructure, and agency (see, e.g., Bolvig 2003; M\u00f8hlenfeldt Jen-\nsen 2003). However, part of my argument is that where there\nwas a perception of betrayal in the relationship between in-\ntercessors, images, and petitioners, contemporary life pro-\nvided a vocabulary of physically appropriate retribution or\nerasure. Where the sense of betrayal was less emphatic, for\nexample, in image-tolerant dispensations and theologies, or\nwhere the images were not necessarily important to religious\nunderstanding, there would have been far less incentive to\nrespond in this way. More studies of the range of patterns\nand their religious and social implications are to be welcomed.\nIn response to one practical point raised by Wienberg, I\nwould point out that the projecting limbs of three-dimen-\nsional imagery will be vulnerable to breakage if the imagery\nis handled, removed from its original position, and moved\nabout in museum store-rooms, but the erasure of specific\nbody parts on two-dimensional imagery cannot be explained\nby simple wear-and-tear.\nOn another tack, I knew that my argument would not and\ncould not be \u201ccomplete,\u201d as Johnson is correct to indicate. A\nmore complete consideration of changing patterns of literacy,\ncapitalism, class, and gender in relation to the aspects of icon-\noclasm with which I was concerned in this article would have\nbeen a far larger project than it could have encompassed. It\nseems to me that, in response to Johnson, there are two issues:\nfirst a simple matter of clarification and second the wider\nconsiderations to which he alludes.\nFirst, I do not consider the reactions Johnson delineates in\nrespect of other patterns of economic and cultural practice\nas incompatible with the actions I suggest in response to\nimages. I have been careful to point out the range of social\nactors at least recorded as having been engaged in-iconoclasm,\nwhich crosses social classes and, to a less retrievable extent,\ngender (Aston 1988). Whilst following Wandel (1995) in\nthinking that the physical act of iconoclasm gave a voice to\nmany who were not preachers, writers, or officials and whose\nnames are unknown, I did not intend to imply that these\nactors were illiterate. To say that certain iconoclasts did not\nnecessarily have control over more protected and conven-\ntional forms of communication\u2014the treatise, the pamphlet,\nthe sermon, the propaganda image\u2014in which to record or\narticulate their personal acts of iconoclasm does not mean\nthat they were illiterate or that they did not engage in the use\nand production of documents of many sorts in other aspects\nof their lives. My specific aim in emphasizing these points\nwas to attest that not every iconoclast has been recorded as\nsuch.\nThe state of current thinking on levels of literacy across\nsocial class in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in En-\ngland suggests that literacy was relatively high and certainly\nrising. The complexity of engagement with texts in changing\nsocial relations and ways of thinking has been explored by\nJohnson (1996). Many of those artisans, for example, who\ntook part in acts of iconoclasm would have acquired (and\nrequired) some degree of literacy to further their livelihoods\nand businesses, particularly in the changing world of this\nperiod (e.g., Brooks 1994; Farr 2000). Craft regulation was a\nrecursive relationship between order as accounted for in texts\nand order as accounted for in actions (Berlin 1997) to which\nProtestant ideas, capitalist work relations, and social practices\ngave new and poignant nuances. I may have erred in taking\nthis understanding for granted. As Johnson (1996) has argued,\nnew ways of thinking about and ordering the world emerge\nin this period, many of them inspired by the kind of en-\ngagement with literacy that, for example, the Protestant em-\nphasis on reading the Bible encouraged (although the use of\nreligious texts in late medieval secular piety was already sig-\nnificant amongst the \u201cmiddling sort\u201d [Aston 1984; Swanson\n2004; Duffy 2006]). In a world where old certainties were\nbeing smashed and churches, landscapes, and living spaces\nreordered (Johnson 1996; 2007, 152\u201361), the peasant farmer\nand the artisan may well have seized the opportunities and\npotential for power that engaging with new cultural resources\noffered them and that sending their sons to grammar school\ncreated for following generations. Rather than excluding this\npossibility, I envisage some acts of iconoclasm as expressions\nof that engagement. I was categorically not implying that the\nmaterial record reflects a simple dichotomy between \u201cpopular\nor folk understandings\u201d and \u201cgestural culture,\u201d on the one\nhand, and a \u201cdocumentary record of elite doctrinal and po-\nlitical impulse,\u201d on the other: a great deal of the vocabulary\nof body discourse, body discipline, and violence permeated\nthe changes and complexities of class and gender discourse\nand was therefore accessible to people in many social spheres.\nTowards the end of my article I suggested one level of un-\nderstanding and response hitherto unexplored but not exclu-\nsive of other ways of thinking and behaving.\nSecondly, Johnson\u2019s work in exploring the interconnect-\nedness between the material ordering of the world, the ne-\ngotiation of social relations, and the ordering of documents\nas artefacts has been extremely influential. Iconoclasm in this\nperiod was precisely an attempt to assert the authority and\nGraves Images, Punishment, and Personhood 53\nprimacy of the Word and its conveyance through text and\nspeech over image. In addition to official texts painted on\nchurch walls and commandment boards, words, texts, and\nposies\/poesies were chalked, scratched, or written in coals as\ngraffiti in both domestic and church contexts, on a wide range\nof artefacts, and on bodies (tattoos, labels) (Jones 2002, 87;\nFleming 2001; Cressy 1999, 28). The very consciousness of\nthe materiality of text and the material contingency of text\nin the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provides scope for\nfurther research, particularly on ideas of erasure, concealment,\nand whitewashing\u2014the aggressive and protective imposition\nand obliteration of text (Cooper 2001; Fleming 2001; Cum-\nmings 2002; Groebner 2004).\n\u2014C.
