For monolithic IR \ndetectors the thermal budget for PST deposition is limited by the underlying CMOS circuitry \nwhich suffers from thermally induced degradation of the Al-Si interconnect metallization [1].  \nRecently there has been a move away from the fully monolithic approach for PST based \ndetectors in order to remove these thermal budget limitations and enable high merit figures for \nIR detection to be realized [2].  In this composite thermal detectors the arrays of microbridges \nare fabricated on an interconnect wafer, able to withstand temperatures of up to 1000 \u00b0C, which \nis then flip-chip bonded to the read-out integrated circuit [2]. \n    Extensive research has been reported on the ordering of PST. However, only limited reports have \nbeen devoted to the crystallisation and very little, if any, on the kinetics of phase transformations of \nperovskite PST from its amorphous or pyrochlore phases.  In this paper we report our study on the \nkinetics of phase transformations from amorphous to pyrochlore and then to perovskite in PST thin \nfilms. \n \nEXPERIMENTAL  \n    The substrates used were (100)-Si single crystal wafers which were thermally oxidised and \novercoated with a sputtered platinum\/titanium(Pt\/Ti) layer.  The PST was deposited by \nsputtering.  More details have been published elsewhere [3]. The as-deposited wafer was cut into \nseveral pieces of squares about 10 mm x 10 mm, and each piece was then subjected to a series \nof RTA and structural characterisation processes.  \n 3\n \nRTA of the samples was carried out using an AG Associate Heatpulse system with a heating \nramp rate of 100\u00b0C\/s and natural cooling.  A piece of thin film was RTA annealed for a pre-\ndetermined time, e.g. 5 s, after the RTA treatment the structures of the film were investigated \nusing conventional \u03b8\/2\u03b8 X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans. This alternating process of RTA and X-\nray diffraction was repeated for the same piece of  film either until full crystallisation was \nachieved, or until it was confirmed that no further transformation of pyrochlore to perovskite \nwas taking place.  \n    The Avrami equation [4] has been widely used to model the kinetics of phase transformation \nand is given by V(t) = 1 - exp(- k tn), where V(t) is the transformed fraction at time t, n is  the \nAvrami coefficient whose value normally varies from 1 to 3 [4].  \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \n    The structure of the as-deposited PST films was found to depend on sputtering conditions \nespecially deposition temperature. Figure 1 shows XRD patterns for the films deposited at 200 \n(PST499), 300 (PST307) and 450 (PST183) \u00b0C respectively. It can be seen that PST183 had \nstrong peaks of pyrochlore. For the film PST499, the crystalline phases included PbO and \nSc6TaO11.5, no apparent pyrochlore peaks were observed for this film.  For the film PST307 \ndeposited as the intermediate temperature 300 \u00b0C,  a mixture of PbO, non-stoichiometric \nSc6TaO11.5 and pyrochlore Pb2(Sc0.5Ta1.5)O3 were found to co-exist. Apart from these crystalline \nphases, amorphous material was found by TEM to be present in the films deposited at 300 \u00b0C or \nbelow. \n 4\n \n    The complexity of the structure of the as-deposited PST films introduces some uncertainty in \nthe kinetics of the PST crystallisation. For simplicity we consider two extreme cases, i.e., the \nstarting materials being fully amorphous or pyrochlore.  \n \n    First we consider the starting material being amorphous (model A). Upon annealing PST \nundergoes transformations from amorphous to pyrochlore (Py) then  to perovskite (Pe), which \ncan be represented as follows: \n  zyx nknk \u23af\u23af\u2192\u23af\u23af\u2192\u23af 2211 ,,  \nhere x, y, and z are the volume fractions of the amorphous, pyrochlore and perovskite phases \nrespectively, n1, k1, n2, and k2 are transformation parameters in Avrami equation.  \nIf there is an amount  r of the  pyrochlore phase which for some reason does not transform into \nperovskite, then the pyrochlore y can be divided into two parts: an active component ya, which \nundergoes the transformation into z and is therefore dependent on all four transformation \nparameters n1,k1,n2, and k2, and a passive component yp which only undergoes transformation \nfrom the amorphous but does not convert into z, and therefore is only dependent on parameters \nn1 and k1. The exact time profile of the yp is not known but it is plausible to assume that this \npyrochlore component also obeys Avrami kinetics, i.e.,   \n( )111 ntkp ery \u2212\u2212\u22c5= ,      \nthen we have  \n( ) ( ) \u222b \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2212+\u2212\u22c5= \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212 t kkntktk deeknererty nnnn\n0\n1\n11\n2\n2\n1\n112\n1\n1 11)( \u03c4\u03c4 \u03c4\u03c4                 (1) \n 5\nSubstituting the expression for ya to equation (4) gives the following expression for z: \n( ) \u03c4\u03b8\u03b8\u03c4 \u03c4 \u03b8\u03b8\u03c4 ddeeknenkrtz t kknkn nnn\u222b \u222b \u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\u22c5\u22c5\u2212= \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n0 0\n1\n11\n1\n22\n2\n2\n1\n11\n2\n221)(           (2) \nwhere y(t) and z(t) represent the theoretical volume fractions of  the pyrochlore and perovskite \nphases at time t respectively with py and pe the corresponding experimental values. Parameters \nn1, k1, n2, and k2 can be obtained by minimising the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) \nwhich was defined as: \n( ) ( )( ) ( )( )\u2211 \u2212+\u2212=\ni\niiii tZpetYpyknknSSE\n22\n2211 ,,,                 \nwith summarisation over all the experimental points for the film annealed at a particular \ntemperature. \n \n    The volume fractions of the Py and Pe phase (marked by x and \u25ca respectively) as functions of \nannealed time are plotted in figure 2b, theoretical curves of y(t) and z(t) (solid line and dotted-\nline respectively), as obtained by finding the best fitting parameters n1, k1, n2, and k2, are also \nshown in  figure 2b. Figure 2a, c and d show the simulated curves y(t) and z(t) as compared with \nthe responding experimental data for temperatures 650, 725 and 750 \u00b0C respectively. It can be \nseen that there is a good agreement between the simulated and the experimental values. From \nthe Arrhenius equation the activation energies for the perovskite formation is calculated to be \n219 KJ\/mol.  \n \n    As an alternative, we can assume the starting film being fully pyrochlore (model B). We can \nalso assume that the residual pyrochlore was uniformly distributed within the perovskite, i.e., \n 6\nthe volume fraction of the residual pyrochlore is proportional to the volume of the perovskite. \nNow the transformation can be described as:  \n  zy nk \u23af\u23af \u2192\u23af 22 ,  \nwe also assume \nyr = c * z                             \nwe have the following solutions: \n)()( 22)1(1 1\nntkc\nc ecty\n+\u2212\n+ +\u22c5=                   (3) \n)1()( 22)1(1 1\nntkc\nc etz\n+\u2212\n+ \u2212\u22c5=                     (4) \nin the limit t \u2192\u221e these equations yield y(\u221e) = c\/(1+c) and z(\u221e) = 1\/(1+c), therefore c can be \ncalculated from the amount of residual pyrochlore r = c\/(1+c). The parameters n2, and k2 can be \nobtained by minimising the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) as defined before. \n \n    Figure 3a, b, c and d depict the simulated curves y(t) and z(t) (solid line and dotted-line \nrespectively) according to equations (3) and (4) as compared with the responding experimental \ndata (x and \u25ca for pyrochlore and perovskite respectively)  for temperatures 650, 700, 725 and \n750 \u00b0C respectively. From Arrhenius plot the activation energy for the perovskite formation is  \n352 KJ\/mol.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n    PST thin films for pyroelectric application have been deposited by rf sputtering and \ntransformed into the desired perovskite structure by rapid thermal annealing. Two extreme cases \n 7\nwhere the starting material being either pure amorphous or pure pyrochlore have been studied in \ndetails. Equations have been derived and numerical calculation used to simulate the volume \nfractions for pyrochlore and perovskite as functions of annealing time. Transformation \nparameters k and n were obtained by comparing the simulated to the experimental intensities \nusing a least-square curve fitting technique. Activation energies for phase transformations were \ncalculated for both the extreme cases.  \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS: This work was financially supported by EPSRC platform grant \nGR\/R92448 and the UK Ministry of Defence. \n \nReferences \n [1] Whatmore R W and Watton R: Pyroelectric materials and devices.
