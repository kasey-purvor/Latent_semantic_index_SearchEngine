Is learning as an activity\nfundamentally changing as a result of the opportunities offered by new technologies and tools? How\nare the new communicative channels and increased social dimensions possible through Web 2.0\ntechnologies impacting on the way students work and learn? And what does this mean for the role\nof teachers and institutions in terms of how they support students? This paper considers these\nquestions and reports on findings from current research evaluating how students are actually using\ntechnologies and what this research tells us about the ways in which patterns of learning might be\nchanging. It will consider the implications for individual teachers (in terms of designing and\nsupporting learning activities for students) and institutions in terms of the impact on policy and the\nassociated infrastructure needed to provide an appropriate environment that maximises the potential\noffered by new technologies. \nKeywords: Student experience, evaluation, technology use, learning design, audio logs\n1  Introduction\nWhereas early use of the web tended to be predominantly about static presentation of\ninformation (\u2018Web 1.0\u2019), O\u2019Reilly (2005) describes a shift towards a more interactive\nuse of the web, characterised by social networking and user generation of content\n(\u2018Web 2.0\u2019). Many argue that the new possibilities of these social networking tools are\nresulting in a fundamental shift in the way we work and learn (Alexander, 2006;\nDownes, 2006; O\u2019Hear, 2006). Rich immersive virtual environments such as \u2018Second\nLife\u2019 are exciting educators in terms of the possibilities they offer for learning\n(Calongne, ND). The rate of this change and its impact has been phenomenal and the\nincreasing impact of technologies on all aspects of our lives shows no signs of abating.\nListening to the learner voice 125\nThis clearly has major implications for education and raises a whole series of questions.\nHow are students using these new tools for learning? Are there indications that the ways\nin which they are working and communicating (and hence learning) are changing? What\nare the implications for how teachers create and maintain a supportive learning\nenvironment maximising the potential of these technologies? What are the implications\nat an institutional level and what is the appropriate mix of institutional versus personally\nappropriate technologies? This paper considers these issues by reporting on the findings\nfrom a study that aimed to elicit the student voice and evaluate the ways in which\nstudents are using technologies to support their learning. It then considers the\nimplications of these findings in terms of how teachers design learning activities and\nhow institutions develop appropriate policy and strategy. It highlights some of the\ncurrent work in learning design through a methodology which aims to support teachers\nin making more effective use of technologies and concludes by arguing that there is a\nneed for a closer synergy between research on student evaluation, learning design and\ninstitutional policy.  \nThis paper considers the factors associated with this new dynamic, technology-rich\nenvironment, drawing on the findings from the JISC-funded1 Learning Experience study\n(LXP) that explored students\u2019 use of technologies across four subject disciplines.\nAlthough the data was gathered at a time when the full impact of Web 2.0 technologies\nwas only just emerging, the findings provide evidence of how the environment within\nwhich students are learning is rapidly changing. The paper will focus in particular on the\nfindings found through working with the Languages and Linguistics subject centre of the\nUK Higher Education Academy, and will consider the implications for language learning.\nIt will consider both the teacher and student perspectives \u2013 offering suggestions on how\nwe need a new approach to the design and delivery of learning activities to maximise the\npotential affordances of the increasingly abundant range of tools and resources available\nto help teachers facilitate and scaffold learning, and for learners to appropriate these tools\nand resources for their own personalised learning needs. \nThe paper draws on a number of other sources of evidence to support the arguments\nbeing made. The work of Oblinger and Oblinger (2005) and the more recent ECAR\nsurvey of IT use (ECAR, 2007) in the states and Kennedy et al. (2006) in Australia are\nused as international comparisons. \n2  Methodology\nThe LXP study focused on two main questions. How do learners engage with and\nexperience e-learning (perceptions, use and strategies)? How does e-learning relate to\nand contribute to the whole learning experience? To ensure a wide range of student\nexperiences, data was collected with the support of four HE Academy subject centres:2\nMedicine, Dentistry and Veterinary Medicine; Economics; Information and Computer\nSciences; and Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies. Data collection consisted of three\n1.

Conole126\nmain sources: an online survey, audio logs and interviews. We used purposive sampling\nrather than random sampling or comparison groups and selected \u201cinformation-rich case\nstudies that manifest the phenomenon\u201d (Mayes, 2006). The combination of methods\nprovided rich empirical descriptions of use and perceptions of technologies, whilst\nensuring that there was some triangulation of data. The participating institutions provided\na range of contexts across the UK \u2013 old and new institutions, city and regionally based. A\ntotal of 427 valid surveys and 85 audio logs were collected. Fourteen interviews were\nconducted with students who had submitted the audio logs. Full details on the\nmethodology are provided elsewhere (Conole et al., 2006; Conole et al., 2008).\n3  The learner voice: focusing on the language students\nThis section attempts to capture the heart of the learner voices illustrated through the in-\ndepth case studies. The case studies drew on the data from the 85 audio log diaries left by the\nstudents and the fourteen semi-structured interviews. They were intended to illustrate \u201cthe\nrich diversity of the ways in which the students across the subject disciplines were using\ntechnologies, to draw out the \u2018learner voices\u2019 and to try and get a clearer understanding of\ntheir use of technologies holistically, over time and to support all aspects of their lives and\nlearning\u201d (Conole et al., 2006). An overwhelming feature that emerged from the case studies\nwas the fact that technologies appeared to be integral to learning for all the students,\nirrespective of their background, prior IT expertise, learning preferences or subject discipline\nstudied. Two of the case studies from the language students are represented here. Each voice\nis presented as a summary that attempts to capture that student\u2019s story and in particular their\nown unique perceptions of and experiences with technologies. \n3.1 Learner one \u2013 Dzel \nDzel was a 24-year-old Turkish student, studying for a masters in applied linguistics for\nlanguage teaching. She lived in a hall of residence. Her audio logs and the interview\nrevealed that she used a range of technologies including: the Internet generally and\nGoogle in particular for searching, the institutional web catalogue for library searches,\nWord and Powerpoint for coursework and presentations, a memory stick for transporting\ninformation, the telephone to talk with friends. She had a laptop that she bought towards\nthe end of her first degree. During the time data was being collected she was focusing on\nher thesis and final assessments, which included essays on language teaching and\ncurriculum, language teaching and education, sociolinguistics and a presentation for her\n\u2018autonomy\u2019 unit. Her assignment focus was on the role of technology, teachers and\nlearning objects for language learning.\nIn comparison to some of the other students she uses technologies to a more limited\ndegree. She uses Word and PowerPoint to prepare for her assignments and presentations\nand both Google and the library web catalogue to find information and resources. The\ndata suggests that she is an example of a student who is still in more of a traditional\nmindset in terms of the use of technologies \u2013 text books feature as her primary resource\nand she comments that she sometimes finds it difficult to obtain relevant articles and\ninformation from the web, suggesting that she may lack the necessary information\nsearching and evaluation skills. In terms of subject specific uses of technologies,\nListening to the learner voice 127\nhowever, she comments that she finds online dictionaries useful as a means of checking\nwords and finding new vocabulary. However, she does not appear to use discussion\nforums or MSN chat extensively, preferring to phone friends directly to talk about\nassignments and work activities. She describes technologies as \u2018supporters\u2019 or\n\u2018facilitators\u2019 for learning and as a \u2018rich\u2019 resource, allowing her to access content easily.\nShe thought it would be \u2018impossible\u2019 to \u2018access\u2019 knowledge without technologies as they\noffered the opportunity to write, search the web, browse library files and prepare and\npresent work. She plans to keep using technologies when she completes her studies in\nher professional practice as she thinks they can be motivating, despite having some\nconcerns about plagiarism and how pupils might use technologies inappropriately.\nShe described how the students in her group used the discussion forum as a space to\ncollectively decide what they were going to focus on. Although she did actively browse\nthe discussion forum, she did not contribute significantly and complained that a\nminority could sometimes dominate the forum. \nWe used Blackboard for all the courses actually this discussion board was\nspecifically used for the autonomy unit but we didn\u2019t use it for the other units. I\nfound it very interesting; we could access it in our free time and just write a\ncomment whenever we wanted too and it was a nice discussion coz everyone just\nwrote a question, when you wanted and then, ahh and then the others could join. So\nI found it very interesting, but I think always the same people just contributed to the\ndiscussions, so I don\u2019t think there was a, I mean that not everyone contributed so not\neveryone joined the discussion.\nShe commented on cultural differences in technology use, observing that VLEs were not\nso prevalent in Turkey. She had also noticed that email appears to be a more common\nmode for communicating with tutors in the UK. She felt that more support was perhaps\nneeded for foreign students, arguing that many will have had limited exposure to the use\nof technologies in a learning context before coming to the UK. \nActually I found some differences in the materials for courses. For example back in\nTurkey we don\u2019t have any Blackboard site. And we didn\u2019t have any webmails\nspecific for our school. So I mean, for example here communication was really just\ndone by, by email, whereas in Turkey during your studies it\u2019s not that widespread\ncommunicating through email\u2026 em, for example in my own study you would just\ngo directly to the teacher to have to ask something. \nHowever overall she did feel that the resources (digital and non-digital) available were\nsuitable and relevant to her studies.\nYes, definitely, they were very suitable and I think they were very, that the resources\nwere very rich. And I really benefited a lot from them the whole time during my studies,\nespecially during this first year\u2026 For example, for the xxx improving my English, there\nwere some language resources. For the university, we could access and I mean I studied\nall kinds of which they are like writing about, reading about, listening and specifically\nabout our courses we also had some online material and yeah. And that was great.\nG. Conole128\nShe sees technologies as important for her own practice and is internalising her\nexperience as a learner and what this means in terms of the ways she might use\ntechnologies to support her own teaching. \nI think they [technologies] are quite important and em they are really I mean a great\nadvantage coz, I am a teacher myself. And I think they are very important like for\nlanguage learning as well as for teaching for everything, they are very important.\n3.2  Learner two \u2013 Peizhi \nPeizhi was a 22-year-old Chinese student, studying for a masters in applied linguistics for\nlanguage teaching. Like Dzel she lived in a hall of residence, but was a more active user of\ntechnologies than Dzel. Technologies mentioned included MSN, ICQ, QQ (chat software);\nSkype, SPSS (analysing data for her dissertation), Word, PowerPoint, and Blackboard.  \nFor her MSN and Skype were essential. She uses them to keep in touch with family and\nfriends and to collect data from Chinese students for her dissertation. MSN was always\n\u2018on\u2019 she said and was \u2018very important\u2019 for her. Other technologies she noted included\nSPSS for analysis of data and the basic suite of tools available from Microsoft Office. \nFrom her experience, technologies were used far less for study purposes in China. For\nexample, for her first English degree she used radio, television and basic lecture notes,\nwhereas when she came to the UK she started to use a wider range of technologies, such\nas Skype for communication and SPSS for data manipulation. \nI think it [referring to the technology] is very important, coz in China, em, when we\nneed teachers, we just need them, and the teachers I don\u2019t think in such a rush and\nyou can ask them questions and even follow them to their office after class. But here\neverything you have to make, make an appointment, you have to send email and not\nall things sent by email are not things like the programme Blackboard [sentence\nspoken in broken English, interviewee referring Blackboard as a system they do not\nhave in China]. Although in China, we do use these kind of systems although I don\u2019t\nuse them quite often but here if you don\u2019t look into it, you are not using these\nthings, ah. I think that is more important, that everything in your year arranged in\norder before so you can know what you are going to do but in China I don\u2019t think it\nis like that and here the students might report that way\u2026.. In China most of the time\nwe don\u2019t use computers that often, when you have to do an assessment you don\u2019t\nhave to have it typed. So although, in China we have email and QQ (chat system)\nwe don\u2019t check that this often.\nAlthough enthusiastic about the use of technologies, she was also aware that an\nenvironment of constant email, MSN and other forms of communication was not always\nconducive to studying.\nSometimes you cannot concentrate on doing one thing, if I am at home, I mean in\nChina, if you don\u2019t have a laptop, you write everything out by your hand. It is easier\nfor you to concentrate, but here when you type often xxx and that you cannot help to\nlisten to this and that.\nListening to the learner voice 129\nOne of the benefits of the institutional VLE (Blackboard) that she highlighted was that it\nmeant that the materials for the course were all co-located and always available, so you\ncould refer back to them.\nThe good thing, is that, what you want is always there, so you can, I mean, that if at\nthe beginning, I think the teacher give out, ah, some pamphlets, that I think lost\nthem but most of them you can always download them, from the internet. It is a pity\nthat when you take them to the Blackboard, you can just the little things, you can,\nyou courses, you have, you know, some other courses you might have interests in\nyou can not get access to the data.\nHowever she also said that there were drawbacks to Blackboard, because sometimes\nstudents \u2018forget to look at it\u2019. Like Dzel, she had some reservations about the discussion\nforums, but for her the issue was that because it was asynchronous it meant that other\nstudents and the tutors were often not logged on at the same time as you. \n\u2026.eh, you don\u2019t know who is on the Blackboard, sometime you want someone to\ndiscuss but they are not there, they just leave a message there, and you put your\nopinion there several days ago, you see someone say \u2018not it\u2019s not that case\u2019\u2026.but\nyou have, you can, you might forget what you have said and what others have said\nand you have to look at it again. I think this is quite, disappointed. So I just go there\nnot quite often, I see, I just want to see what other people talk.\nShe felt contributing to forums was important but sometimes was frustrated because she\nfelt she was contributing just for the sake of it, rather than as part of a meaningful debate\nwith others.\nI think I look more often than I talk, although I talk, I just think, it is not too good if\nyou just look and not talk, so I just talk not because I want to.\nShe used the web extensively to find relevant information for her course but was aware\nof some of the limitations, highlighting in particular the issue of the variable quality of\ninformation on the web and the lack of details to be able to adequately reference\nmaterial (which appears to be a particular problem with Chinese sites). \nI use search quite often, however you must be very good at using, choosing key\nwords, or else you\u2019ll find a pack of rubbish. Sometimes, the things on the internet\nyou are not sure whether they are right or wrong and I think the English it is alright\nbut for the Chinese most of the time, they wouldn\u2019t give you the name of the people\nand they the b..bibliography or the time or date of the data or something like that. It\njust, its just there so when you write dissertation or something like that you cannot\nreally use it, or it will cause a big problem, how is it, who write it each one, is that\nreliable or something like that.\nPeizhi valued the opportunity to experience different cultures and said that her reasons\nfor coming to study in the UK were not just to \u2018learn original English style\u2019 of\nG. Conole130\ncommunicating but also to learn \u2018what others were doing\u2019. This was reflected in her\ncomments about how she liked to discuss work with other international and British\nstudents, particularly those who had different opinions to her.\nMostly when I need help I turn to the British students and other International\nstudents, rather then Chinese more, I think. Coz when Chinese look at a sentence\nthey, think, they might have the same opinion but one thing, people from different\nculture, they have different things. So I think you learn more. I would rather to\ndiscuss with other international students, as long as they have different opinions.\nShe also discussed how her experience in the UK had changed her perspectives on things. \n\u2026I think the things I learnt here is very useful for me\u2026\u2026\n\u2026coming to England is not just coz the teaching here is good, because I can get\naccess to other cultures, other ways of thinking, so in this way, if you know more\nabout others, you know more about yourself \n\u2026you realise why I am different from others\u2026\nShe did struggle with some cultural differences however. For example she sometimes\nfound it difficult to ask questions in class or to contribute to debates with the other\nstudents, as she had little prior exposure to argumentation and debate during her\neducation in China. In particular she discussed how her first week in the UK was very\nhard as the teacher expected the students not only to find the answers in the book but\nalso to present their opinions and argue their points. This approach was not familiar to\nher and she discussed how in China writing assignments was easier than in the UK\nbecause they were not expected to discuss ideas in the same way.\n\u2026.I mean sometimes the Chinese wouldn\u2019t have conflict with each other, they\nwouldn\u2019t agree, here teacher, would like the students to argue.\nTo record her experiences, Peizhi kept a blog (written partly in English and partly in\nChinese) of her experience in the UK.  The following extracts illustrate the different uses\nof her blog \u2013 to record her private thoughts and perspectives; as a notebook or reference\nfor content that she found appropriate to her studies; a record of her life in the UK.\nYeah, I write blog nearly everyday, that is when I look into these things, and I think\nsomething is important, I write it in my blog, as a notebook ...but my blog, I mean\nthe blog, is not too others, I mean in my course can not see it in fact, coz some of the\nthings is important for me, I think it is new to me and sometimes you don\u2019t want to\nshare everything with others \n\u2026. some of them is just to say what I learnt from the teacher today, yeah and,\njust the progress, what is the progress of the day, and some is like I think ah this is\nnew ideas and ah I write it down and sometimes I say well I like this paragraph and\nI copy it down, and sometimes it just I don\u2019t like this class and give a comment on\nxxx students or something like that, mmm\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..sometimes you just write\nsome nonsense on it.\nListening to the learner voice 131\nPeizhi\u2019s experiences highlight the complexity and overlaying cultural norms and modes\nof communication and interaction that overseas students simultaneously engage in when\nstudying in the UK. For Peizhi technology plays a vital, mediating role, a bridge\nbetween worlds, which allows her to keep in touch with friends and family, collect data\nfor her thesis and reflect on her experiences of studying in a foreign country.\n4  Discussion\nThe two learner voices described here give a flavour of the ways in which students are\nusing technologies and how they are appropriating use to meet their own needs and\npreferences. Dzel and Peizhi are both foreign students struggling to adapt to learning in\nthe UK, but the ways in which they use technologies are different, with Peizhi using a\nwider range of technologies than Dzel and placing a higher value on the communicative\naffordances of tools like MSN chat and Skype. This is echoed in the wider set of data\nfrom the survey results, the audio logs and the other interviews (Conole et.al., 2008). An\nillustration of this wider body of data is presented in Table 1, which provides a selection\nof the audio logs received from the Language students. \nA parallel study undertaken by Creanor et al. (2006), although working with a\ndifferent population of students, found similar patterns of technology use. Our findings\nmap to an international trend toward higher levels of PC-ownership, coupled with\nincreased ICT usage and skills (See for example ECAR, 2007; Kennedy et al., 2006).\nMany are now arguing that these students fundamentally differ from previous\ngenerations in the way they process information and communicate (and hence learn).\nTerms such as: \u2018digital natives\u2019, \u2018the net generation\u2019, \u2018the Nintendo generation\u2019, \u2018the\nneomillenial generation\u2019 (See for example Oblinger & Oblinger, 2005; Prensky, 2001;\nBaird & Mercedes, 2006) have been used to try and encapsulate this shift. The\ncharacteristics of this new generation include the fact that they are comfortable with\ntechnologies and adept at working in multiple\/multi-modal environments. The ways that\nthey learn are more task orientated and experiential. These learners prefer to receive\ninformation quickly, are adept at processing information and multi-tasking, and using\nmultiple communication channels to access information and communicate with friends\nand tutors. They seamlessly integrate online resources and desktop applications with\npaper-based materials. They are critical users \u2013 not prepared to take the use of tools at\nface value but wanting evidence of real use and benefit. The changes also hint at a\npotential change in the nature of the way they learn; suggesting that they are strategic\nand experiential in the way they learn, more comfortable with group learning than\nprevious generations. \nWe found that the students used the web extensively to extend their understanding of\nconcepts and supplement course material. A study by Kennedy et al. (2006) in Australia\nfocused on how students were using technologies to communicate, publish and share\ninformation and their findings were in line with ours, namely that there is extensive use\nof technology by students; they argue that this has considerable implications for\ninstitutional policy and practice. Similarly the ECAR survey (2007) indicated that\nInternet searching was one of students\u2019 most important strategies for learning, with 72%\nlisting Internet searching as their preferred means of learning. In our study we also\nfound that Google was their first action when trying to get information and Wikipedia is\nG.

A selection of the audio logs received from the Language students\nG. Conole134\nused extensively. Most find Google easy to use. However, there is some evidence that\nstudents do not always find what they want from a search engine and that they do not\nnecessarily have the advanced searching skills needed to perform detailed academic\nsearches. The rapid positioning of Wikipedia as an important authoritative text, despite\nits relative newness, is an important indicator of the way in which students are now\nusing technologies with peer review and sharing of \u2018what counts as good\u2019 being an\nimportant scaffold to help make meaning of a complex and constantly changing\ninformation landscape. \nStudents did however discuss how difficult it could be to assert the credibility of\nsources found on the web, and adopted strategies to double check sources by cross-\nreferencing and validating material found on the web with other sources (text books,\nlecture notes, etc.), as well as restricting their search scope to reliable sites that they\nlearnt to trust. Methods of validation and cross-referencing indicate that students mix\nand match information sources, combining old and new methods. For many the Internet\nwas invaluable in terms of enabling them to access up-to-date information. Specialised\nsubject-based sites were cited frequently. Printed textbooks were considered by some to\nbe outdated and difficult to digest but were still used by many as a baseline measure.\nStudents described how they tended to use a process of trial and error to refine their\nweb searching skills. The degree to which tutors steered students in terms of relevant\nresources varied, depending on individual departments and tutors: some provided links\nto recommended sites, whereas others did not. Links to useful sites were frequently\npassed between students. \nStudents recognised the value of library catalogues in terms of being able to see\navailability and reserve books online. The ECAR survey (2007) found similar results, with\nstudents reporting a relatively high expertise in ICT skills; although the report also\ncautioned that these self-reports are sometimes over inflated. In our study it was evident\nthat some difficulties were reported in using catalogues and students were frustrated when\nthey found that a paper they wanted was in a journal that their university did not subscribe\nto. \nInformation retrieval from the web was primarily for text-based materials but students\nalso reported searching for images (to include in presentations), as well as downloading\nrelevant podcasts. This was mirrored in the ECAR (2007) and Kennedy et al. (2006)\nstudies. This indicates that the students were drawing on external resources to complement\ncourse materials; appropriating commercial, academic and popular information sources\ntogether so as to gain a better understanding of the topics being studied.\nUse of communication technologies to support their studies was extensive. Many\nstudents reported using mobile phones frequently to phone and text each other, to\ndiscuss issues related to their learning, and particularly for assignment queries. They\nalso used instant messaging software, especially for international communications.\nEmail was used universally and was the main channel for tutor communication. A\ncommon pattern was for email to be used for communication between staff and students,\nwith text messages and instant messaging used for communication with peers. Students\nexpected and generally received quick responses to their emails and appreciated the\nflexibility this provided, although this does raise questions about student-tutor\nexpectations in terms of response times. The ECAR survey found that email was still the\nmain communication channel for official university communications. \nListening to the learner voice 135\nThere was surprisingly little mention of discussion forums. The language students\nappeared to use forums most but, as is evident in the extracts from Dzel and Peizhi, they\nprefer to read rather than post messages. Although they considered forums a potentially\nuseful way of engaging with others, they complained that individuals often dominated\ndiscussions. They also found the time lag between message postings and responses\nfrustrating and felt that it was not always possible to engage with issues at a deep level.\nOthers expressed the view that they did not find forums particular useful or inspiring.\nThis should be treated with caution as forum-usage is heavily context dependent in\nterms of how they are integrated and used within a course. However these findings are\ninteresting in that students gave far more examples of the alternative communication\nchannels they were using (text, chat, etc.), suggesting that students are creating their\nown social network to support their learning, tailored to their particular needs and using\nthe technologies which suit them rather than being constrained in topic and technology\nvia discussion forums. A recent survey undertaken by the SPIRE project supports this,\nshowing a significant increase in the uptake of Web 2.0 technologies by students\n(SPIRE, 2007). The ECAR survey found that discussion boards were one of the least\nused features of VLEs; students described them as more time-consuming and less\ninteresting than live discussions (ECAR, 2007: 72).  \nLow cost communication technologies such as Skype, MSN chat and email were\nconsidered invaluable forms of communication and were being used in a variety of ways\n(student-student, student-friends\/family, student-department\/university or tutor). Skype,\nsoftware which allows students to call people for free or at a low cost via the internet,\nwas specifically mentioned by foreign students as a cheap, easy way to keep in touch\nwith friends and family. For some students text messaging and the mobile phone,\nalthough popular, were regarded as more expensive options. \nStudent use of blogs varied; some used blogs as a means of keeping up-to-date with\nnew developments, others used them as a reflective diary. As described earlier, Peizhi\nkept a blog as a record of her experiences in the UK; other students reported reading\nblogs but did not discuss writing them. Ferguson et al. (2007) describe how Ph.D.\nstudents are now using blogging as an important part of their research practice.\nKerawalla et al. have carried out a detailed study exploring how students are using blogs\nand have developed a framework which outlines the different purposes; the framework\ncategorises use of blogs into four areas: community, audience, presentation and\ncomments (Kerawalla et al., 2007; Kerawalla et al., submitted). \nA high proportion of reported ICT-usage was in connection with assessed work.  The\ndata provided a rich picture of the ways in which students are using technologies on a\ndaily basis to support routine aspects of their study. Students used Word to write\nassignments as well as take notes and PowerPoint to prepare and give presentations to\ntheir class.  All were positive about the benefits of PowerPoint and Word and some\nwondered how they had ever managed without these tools. Kennedy et al\u2019s (2006) study\nalso uncovered evidence for how students were using technologies to support their\ncoursework. They found that students now relied on computers to create digital\ndocuments and for general study purposes. Students cited few disadvantages to using\nword processing packages and found them invaluable for presenting work. A number of\nstudents mentioned the benefits of Word and PowerPoint in terms of improving the final\npresentation of their work; foreign students valued the grammar, spell checking and\nG. Conole136\ndictionary functionality. However, there is an issue here in that well presented work is\nnot necessarily good in terms of the content. \nThere was surprisingly little mention of subject-specific software. Traditional CAL-\ntype software (such as e-tutorials and simulations) was noticeable by its absence and the\nfew instances that did arise, for example the use of concordance software, were\nprimarily about the difficulty of using the software. \nOnly one person on the survey mentioned a VLE as one of the four technologies they\nlike to use most, and ten listed a VLE as a dislike. Critical factors appear to be whether\nthe VLE is well designed and structured, how relevant the information on the VLE is to\nthe students\u2019 needs and the degree to which it is really embedded into the culture of the\ncourse.  The findings hint that students are beginning to move beyond VLEs as a central\nresource and that they use the VLE only when it meets specific, individual needs. Many\nstudents did say that they used their VLE to check for course-related information and in\nsome cases the VLE was used as a course calendar or for communicating course\nadministration. A fundamental issue is how students integrate use of the institutional\nVLE with their own personally acquired technologies. The ECAR survey found \u201cstudent\nrespondents to be immersed with technology ownership  and use, and impatient with\ninstructors who don\u2019t have adequate technical skills\u201d (ECAR, 2007: 5).  \nDespite the general consensus amongst the students that online course materials \u2018were\na good thing\u2019, face-to-face contact with tutors was still considered necessary and was\ncited as important by a number of students in both the interviews and audio logs. The\nstudents interviewed described the benefit of meeting with classmates and tutors to\ndiscuss work issues. Face-to-face contact was considered vital in building a sense of\ncommunity or \u2018belongingness\u2019 to the class or study group. For many this could not be\nreplaced by online environments. This was a key factor to emerge from the ECAR and\nKennedy et al. studies as well, demonstrating that the students show a degree of\nscepticism and moderation as well as enthusiasm for the use of technologies. They see\nthe value of face-to-face contact and personal communication and want technologies to\nbe used appropriately, rather than extensively. \nThe findings demonstrate that students use a variety of communication tools to\nsupport their learning needs. Also there is evidence from the data that there is a shift in\nemphasis from passive to more interactive, across all aspects of their learning, which is\nanother characteristic of today\u2019s learners. The environment students are working in is\ncomplex and multifaceted; technology is at the heart of all aspects of their lives \u2013 a key\nquestion for institutions is whether institutional infrastructures match students\u2019 own rich\ntechnology-enhanced environment, and perhaps more importantly, whether courses are\ndesigned and delivered with these external influences in mind.\nStudents appear to place greater value on technologies they have \u2018discovered\u2019 or\nselected for themselves. Ownership, personalisation and appropriation of technologies\nare overarching themes that emerge from the data. Personalisation and a sense of\ncontrol come across as key factors of success in the use of technologies. Importantly, if\nstudents did not find the technology or platform provided by the institutions useful they\nwere in a position to by-pass it in favour of their own personalised approach and\npreferred tools.\nThe findings suggest a shift in the way in which students are working with a rich and\ncomplex inter-relationship between individuals and tools. In a recent paper (Conole et\nListening to the learner voice 137\nal., 2008) we described eight factors that emerged from the data in terms of the\nchanging nature of the way students are working and argued that this might form a\nuseful checklist against which institutions might begin to think about and incorporate\nthese findings into policy and practice (Figure 1). \n5  Implications\nThe findings have profound implications for how teachers design learning activities, as well\nas for institutional ICT strategy. Both design and strategy need radical rethinking in light of\nthis new context of students immersed in a technology-enhanced environment, with\nincreasing levels of ICT skills and expectations of inclusion of the use of technologies as\ntools for learning. This section offers some thoughts on how we might begin to bridge this\ngap between students\u2019 expectations and their actual experiences of learning, offering some\nsuggestions for radical rethinking at the level of design and strategy. \nIn terms of supporting teachers and their design strategies, there has been growing\ninterest in recent years in the development of toolkits and planners to support the design\nprocess. Examples include LAMS (www.lamsfoundation.org), DialogPlus toolkit (Fill\net al., 2007; Conole & Fill, 2005), Pheobe (http:\/\/phoebe-project.conted.ox.ac.uk\/cgi-\nbin\/trac.cgi) and the JISC pedagogical planner (http:\/\/www.wle.org.uk\/d4l\/). Coupled\nwith this there have been attempts to capture and synthesise case studies of good practice,\nsuch as the JISC case studies of good practice (http:\/\/www.elearning.ac.uk\/effprac\/) and\ninnovation (http:\/\/www.elearning.ac.uk\/innoprac\/), the AUTC Learning Design project\n(http:\/\/www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au\/) and the TELL Pedagogical Patterns (Tell,\n2005). At the Open University we are currently undertaking a Learning Design project\nwhich is attempting to build on this work. We have developed a formal learning design\nmethodology and are adapting an argumentation and mind mapping tool, Compendium\n(http:\/\/www.compendiuminstitute.org\/), as the basis for guiding teachers through the\nprocess of creating learning activities. Work to date on this is reported elsewhere (Conole\net al., 2007; Conole, 2008[a]; Conole, 2008[b]). We argue that there are two fundamental\nissues associated with this: How can we gather and represent practice (and in particular\ninnovative practice) (capture and represent practice) and how can we provide \u2018scaffolds\u2019\nFig. 1. The eight factors of technology use emerging from the LXP study\nG. Conole138\nor support for staff in creating learning activities which draw on good practice, making\neffective use of tools and pedagogies (support learning design)? \nThe other key challenge is the need to put in place effective policies and strategies at an\ninstitutional level to capitalise on the potential of these new technologies. A recent review\nof the relationship between policy and impact on practice suggests that there is too often a\ngap between what is needed at a \u2018ground-level\u2019 and the approach adopted more\nstrategically (Conole, 2007). Work through the HE Academy e-learning benchmarking\nand pathfinder programmes may offer one way forward. The benchmarking programme\nhas provided a set of formal methodologies for institutions to undertake reflective audits\nin terms of what they are doing with e-learning, along with identification of strengths and\nweaknesses (Plenderleith et al., 2007). This is linked to the follow-on pathfinder\nprogramme, which intends \u201cto be a transformation initiative which has organisational\nchange, development and dissemination as its core aims. The goals of the programme are\nfocused on exploiting and developing synergies to enhance and change practice where\nnecessary\u201d (http:\/\/elearning.heacademy.ac.uk\/weblogs\/pathfinder\/). A series of themes are\nemerging across the programme in terms of approaches to successful implementation of\ne-learning including strategies for embedding and communicating, the nature and format\nof staff and student development, the role of leaner evaluation and adoption of an\nevidence-based approach (Carmichael et al., 2008). \n6  Conclusion \nThe findings from our study and related work in the literature demonstrate that students\nare using technologies to support all aspects of their learning processes (communication\nwith tutors and other students, keeping abreast of course administration, finding and\nmanaging learning materials, processing data, and creating assignments\/presentations).\nThese tools are appropriated in a variety of ways, depending on individual needs and\npreferences. Technology is not simply seen as an \u2018add on\u2019 for these students, it is central\nto how they organise and orientate their learning. \nThe implications of these findings for institutions is profound, suggesting that a\nradical rethink is needed in terms of how courses are designed and the type of\ninfrastructure institutions put in place to support students. The application of a more\nformal learning design methodology has been put forward as a means of changing\ndesign practice and the benchmarking\/pathfinder programmes are offered as\nillustrations of how change can be enacted at an institutional level. Finally I would\nargue that there now needs to be a much closer synergy between evaluation of the\nlearner voice and their evolving use of technology, with the development of\nmethodologies for supporting new forms of design, support for teachers in creating\neffective learning, and the development of appropriate policy and strategy to create\ntechnology-enhanced learning environments within our institutions. \nReferences\nAlexander, B.
