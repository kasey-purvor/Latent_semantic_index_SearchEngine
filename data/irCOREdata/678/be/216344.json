Introduction \nHas economic damage from natural disasters increased over time? This is a question \nof high policy relevance for mainly two reasons. First, if it has then this could require \na policy response in terms of disaster risk management and disaster damage \nmitigation and prevention. Second, an increasing trend of damage from natural \ndisasters could point in the direction that climatic changes may be the driving force, \nwhich would have implications for the debate on reducing greenhouse gas emissions \n(Bouwer 2009; Schmidt, Kemfert and H\u00f6ppe 2009).1 This question has recently \nattracted some broader media attention when critics accused both the Inter-\ngovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Stern (2007) Review of \nallegedly reporting selected pieces of evidence in support of such a trend.2 \nA potential climate change signal is not easily detected from data of economic \nloss from natural disasters, however. One cannot simply look at inflation-adjusted \ndamages from natural disasters and test for a time trend therein. While such an \nanalysis would be interesting for other reasons, any trend found may simply be due to \nthe fact that areas affected by natural disasters have become wealthier over time. For \nexample, people often move to disaster-prone areas such as floodplanes and coastal \nareas because other characteristics of these areas attract them, which provide a higher \nexpected benefit than the expected cost following from damage in the uncertain event \nof natural disaster. Even in the absence of migration, existing populations in affected \nareas are bound to increase over time, while property values are bound to rise. Hence, \nany increase in natural disaster damage may be entirely due to an increase in what can \npotentially be destroyed, i.e. an increase in exposed wealth, rather than because of an \n                                                 \n1\n  For example, IPCC (2001: 13) claims that \u2018part of the observed upward trend in disaster losses \nover the past 50 years is linked to socioeconomic factors (\u2026), and part is linked to climatic \nfactors, such as the observed changes in precipitation and flooding events\u2019. \n2\n  See, for example, Pielke (2007). \n3 \nincrease in the frequency and\/or intensity (potential destructive power) of natural \nhazards.3 Even then, a policy response may be required of course \u2013 for example, in the \nform of discouraging people from migrating to disaster-prone areas and undertaking \nmeasures to protect the lives and property of existing people in such areas. \nThe question that has attraced more scholarly attention, however, is whether \neven after adjusting for changes in wealth, there is still an increasing trend in natural \ndisaster damage over time. Certainly, if one is interested in analyzing whether \nclimatic change plays a role in increasing disaster damage, then this is the question to \naddress. Existing scholarship seemingly provides an exhaustive negative answer to \nthis question already, but there is a large amount of terra incognita in terms of \nadequate regional- and hazard-specific loss analyses, partly because of unavailability \nof data. Existing scholarship comes to the conclusion that while natural variability in \nweather patterns can explain some of the variability in disaster losses (Pielke and \nLandsea 1998; Katz 2002; Pielke et al. 2008; Schmidt, Kemfert and H\u00f6ppe 2009), \nthere is no evidence for a rising long-term trend in so-called \u201cnormalized\u201d disaster \ndamage, which is the damage after adjustments for wealth changes over time. To be \nsure, even if a trend was detected, one needs to be careful in attributing such a trend to \nanthropogenic climate change, i.e. climate change caused by man-made greenhouse \ngas emissions, since natural climate variability could provide an alternative \nexplanation. For example, some studies find an upward trend in normalized damage \nfrom hurricanes in the US since the 1970s (e.g., Schmidt, Kemfert and H\u00f6ppe 2009) \u2013 \na trend, which may well be explained by natural variability in hurricane landfall. \nThere are three reasons why the topic of natural disaster loss normalization \nneeds to be studied further. First, the vast majority of existing studies have either \n                                                 \n3\n  Hazards are events triggered by natural forces. They will turn into natural disasters if people \nare exposed to the hazard and are not resilient to fully absorbing the impact without damage to \nlife or property (Schwab, Eschelbach and Brower 2007). \n4 \nanalyzed losses in the United States (Pielke and Landsea 1998; Brooks and Doswell \n2001; Nordhaus 2006; Pielke et al. 2008; Vranes and Pielke 2009; Schmidt, Kemfert \nand H\u00f6ppe 2009) or other countries (Raghavan and Rajseh 2003; Crompton and \nMcAeneney 2008) or a region (Pielke et al. 2003; Barredo 2009).4 It remains to be \nseen whether what holds true for these individual countries or regions will hold for \nother countries, other regions and the world as a whole. Second, the one study that has \nlooked at disaster damage on a global scale (Miller et al. 2008) suffers from the fact \nthat it had to resort to assembling loss estimates from a plethora of sources, which will \nuse very different criteria and which will produce data of very varied quality. Third, \nthe normalization methodology used by practically all existing studies is, we argue \nhere, incomplete in that it normalizes for changes over time, but fails to normalize for \ndifferences in spatial location at any point of time. This article addresses all three \nshortcomings by analyzing a global sample in addition to region-specific samples, by \nusing a comprehensive high-quality database and by employing, in addition to the \nconventional method, a methodology that normalizes both for changes over time and \ndifferences over space. In other words, this article makes both a contribution to the \nsubstance and the methodology of the literature studying economic loss from natural \ndisasters. \nDespite these differences in research design, we come to similar conclusions \nas existing studies: whilst we find massive increases in non-normalized inflation-\nadjusted natural disaster damage, there is no longer any evidence for an increasing \ntrend once each natural disaster event has been normalized. It is premature to interpret \nthese findings as evidence that climatic factors have not led to an increase in \nnormalized disaster damage. This is because defensive mitigating measures \n                                                 \n4\n  Bouwer (2009) provides a comprehensive literature review.  \n5 \nundertaken by rational individuals and governments in response to more frequent \nand\/or more intensive natural hazards may have reduced natural disaster losses such \nthat these measures would mask any increasing trend in normalized disaster damage. \nUnfortunately, it is impossible to adequately account for measures such as improved \nearly warning systems, better building qualities, heightened flood defences etc. It is \ntherefore impossible to say whether one would see an increasing trend in normalized \nnatural disaster damages in the absence of such measures. \nThis article is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the conventional \napproach to normalise disaster losses, while Section 3 discusses its limitations. Our \nalternative method is presented in Section 4. Results of a global analysis and for \nvarious regions and disaster types are shown in Section 5, using both normalization \napproaches. Section 6 concludes with an emphasis on the caveats and limitations that \nnecessarily accompany our analysis. In particular, we stress that our inability to take \ninto account defensive mitigating measures implies that one cannot infer from our \nanalysis that there has been no actual increase in the frequency and\/or intensity of \nweather-related natural hazards. Our analysis therefore cannot be used to undermine \nthe case for reducing greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 based on the precautionary principle \nand justified in part by a desire to prevent or reduce a potentially increasing trend in \neconomic loss from natural disasters in the future. \n \n2. The conventional approach to normalizing natural disaster loss \nThe conventional approach to normalizing natural disaster loss can be credited to \nRoger Pielke Jr. and co-authors (see Pielke and Landsea 1998, Pielke et al. 1999, \n2003, 2008; Vraines and Pielke 2009). The typical equation to compute normalized \ndamage according to this approach is as follows: \n6 \n \ns s s s\nt t\nt t t\nGDPdeflator Population Wealth per capitaNormalized Damage Damage\nGDPdeflator Population Wealth per capita= \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 (1) \n \nwhere s is the (chosen) year one wishes to normalize to, t is the year in which damage \noccurred, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator adjusts for inflation (i.e., \nchange in producer prices), while the remaining two correction factors adjust for \nchanges in population and wealth per capita. In theory, the population and wealth \nchanges should be based on data from the exact areas affected by the natural disaster \nin question. However, in practice it is often impossible to determine the exact areas or \ninformation on these areas is difficult or impossible to get, so scholars typically resort \nto using data from the country or, if they can, from sub-country administrative units \nknown to be affected (e.g., counties or states). Studies differ with respect to how \nwealth per capita is measured. Some use data on the value of capital stocks (e.g., \nPielke and Landsea 1998; Brooks and Doswell 2001; Vranes and Pielke 2009; \nSchmidt, Kemfert and H\u00f6ppe 2009) or the value of dwellings (Crompton and \nMcAneney 2008; Pielke et al. 2008), others, often for lack of data, simply GDP per \ncapita (e.g., Raghavan and Rajseh 2003; Pielke et al. 2003; Nordhaus 2006; Miller et \nal. 2008; Barredo 2009). With more than one disaster per year, the measure of disaster \nloss per year is the sum of normalized damages from each disaster as per equation (1). \nPielke et al. (2008) justify the conventional normalization approach to disaster \nlosses by saying that it provides \u201clongitudinally consistent estimates of the economic \ndamage\u201d that past disasters would have caused \u201cunder contemporary levels of \npopulation and development\u201d. Normalization thus accounts for the fact that, even \nafter adjusting for inflation, actual damage from disasters in the past, when affected \nareas were less populous and less wealthy, is typically smaller in absolute terms than \n7 \nactual damage from contemporaneous disasters. It therefore adjusts past disaster \ndamage for wealth and population changes to make them comparable to absolute \ncontemporaneous disaster damage. In other words, past disasters would have caused \nhigher damage had they hit the same areas as back then nowadays and normalization \naccounts for the fact that most places have become more populous and wealthier over \ntime. \n \n3. Problems with the conventional normalization approach \nThe problem with conventional normalization is that it is incomplete. It adjusts for \nchanges in wealth and population over time, but fails to adjust for differences in \nwealth and population across space at any given point of time. Conventional \nnormalization correctly posits that a disaster like the 1926 Great Miami hurricane \nwould have caused far more damage if it hit Miami nowadays since the value of what \ncan potentially become destroyed has increased tremendously over this time period \n(Pielke et al. 1999). At the same time, however, a hurricane that hits Miami in any \nyear will cause a much larger damage than a hurricane that hits in the same year rural \nparts of Florida with much lower population density and concentration of wealth. \nConventional normalization accounts for the former effect, but not for the latter. It \nmakes Miami in 1926 comparable to Miami in 2010, but fails to make Miami in \nwhatever year comparable to rural Florida or other areas affected by a particular \nnatural disaster in that same year. \nThe incompleteness of conventional normalization means that it is not a fully \nvalid measure of disaster loss for the purpose of detecting a trend in disaster loss over \ntime. In order to be a valid measure for this purpose, a normalization method must \nfulfil the following two conditions: \n8 \na. Ceteris paribus, normalized loss in period 1 must be higher than \nnormalized loss in period 0 if more disasters of the same intensity strike in \nperiod 1: higher frequency leads to higher loss. \nb. Ceteris paribus, normalized loss in period 1 must be higher than \nnormalized loss in period 0 if the same number of disasters strike in \nperiod 1 with higher intensity: higher intensity leads to higher loss. \nConventional normalization is not guaranteed to fulfil either condition. If more \ndisasters of the same intensity or the same number of disasters with higher intensity \nstrike less wealthy areas in period 1 than in period 0, then the conventionally \nnormalized loss from period 0 may well be higher than the loss in period 1, even in \nthe absence of any growth in wealth between period 0 and 1 (the ceteris paribus \nassumption). By measuring absolute loss rather than relative loss (relative to what can \npotentially be destroyed), conventional normalization fails to provide a valid measure \nof disaster loss. \nWill the failure to account for relative loss (relative to what can potentially be \ndestroyed) represent a problem for conventional normalization in detecting a trend? In \nits defence, one could argue that contrary to temporal changes in wealth and \npopulation for which one is bound to observe more wealth and population in later \ncompared to earlier periods due to population and economic growth, there is no \nreason why one would expect that disasters systematically hit more populous or \nwealthier areas relatively more than less populous or less wealthy areas in either \nearlier or later periods. Invoking the law of large numbers, one could therefore argue \nthat normalization does not need to account for differences in spatial location since \nwith a very large number of disasters such differences in spatial location will cancel \neach other out in an analysis of trends in the aggregated sum of disaster loss over \n9 \ntime: disasters will sometimes hit poor and low population density areas and \nsometimes hit wealthy and high population areas, but with a very large number of \ndisasters the expected damage, normalized according to conventional methodology, is \nthe same in early as in later parts of the study period \u2013 much the same as with many \nthrows of a dice or many tosses of a coin the expected average dice count will be 3.5, \nwhile the expected probability of heads will be 50%. However, depending on what \ntype of disaster (low or high frequency), what unit of aggregation (sub-country units, \ncountry, region, global) and what length of study period one looks at, there may well \nbe too few relevant disasters to invoke the law of large numbers. Also, if one is \ninterested in disaster loss more generally, i.e. going beyond mere trend analysis over \ntime, then one needs to account for differences across spatial location to make a \nmeaningful comparison of relative disaster loss. If, for example, one wants to know \nwhether natural disasters cause relatively more damage in one part of a country, \nregion or the world than in another, then conventional normalization is obviously \nunsuitable. \n \n4. An alternative normalization method \nThe upshot of the discussion in the previous section is that if one wants to make \ndisaster losses that occur in different spatial locations and different time periods \ncomparable, then one needs to normalize for differences in both space and time. In \norder to do so, we have developed another normalization approach that does exactly \nthis. Our normalization equation is specified as follows: \n \nt\nt\nt\nDamageNormalized Damage\nWealth\n=  ,       (2)  \n10 \nIn way of explanation, first note that the population correction factor of the \nconventional methodology is in fact redundant if one were to use in equation (1) a \ncorrection factor for wealth rather than wealth per capita, since the sum of the change \nin population and the change in wealth per capita equals the change in wealth. Hence, \nby using wealth rather than wealth per capita in equation (2), we do not need to \naccount for population. Second, by dividing damage in year t by wealth in year t \nrather than multiplying it with a correction factor s\nt\nWealth\nWealth\n as per conventional \nmethodology, our normalization method does not normalize absolute damage values. \nRather, it expresses damages from any time period as relative damages, namely as a \nrelative loss of total wealth in affected areas, which is theoretically bounded below by \nzero (no damage) and above by one (total loss of all wealth). Equation (2) can \ntherefore be interpreted as an actual-to-potential-loss (APLR) ratio. With more than \none disaster per year, our aggregate measure of disaster loss per year is the sum of \nAPLRs of any given year. As argued below, this provides a valid measure of disaster \nloss, where validity is defined as per the previous section. \nBecause equation (2) measures relative rather than absolute loss, we do not \nneed to scale up or down absolute damages from different points of time to arrive at \nnormalized absolute damages as per conventional methodology. For the same reason, \nwe do not need to adjust for inflation, since damage relative to wealth is a ratio, which \nis not subject to inflation distortion, as long as one divides either nominal damage by \nnominal wealth in year t or damage expressed in constant prices of a given year by \nwealth in prices of the same year. Lastly, note that relative damage normalization as \n11 \nper equation (2) does not require the choice of a base year s to which damages are \nnormalized to as per conventional method of equation (1).5 \nIt should be clear why, contrary to conventional methodology, our competing \nnormalization equation adjusts for differences across spatial location: by dividing \nactual damage by the wealth in affected areas that can potentially be destroyed we \nadjust for the fact that the same natural disaster will necessarily create more absolute \ndamage if it strikes a wealthier area than if it stroke a poorer area where there is less \npotential wealth to be destroyed. But what about adjusting for differences over time? \nBy expressing normalized damage as damage in relation to wealth, no further \nadjustment for differences in wealth over time are needed as relative damage is time-\ninvariant and therefore directly comparable across time. An example may advance \nunderstanding of this crucial point. The 1926 Great Miami hurricane would have \ncreated a much larger absolute damage than the absolute damage recorded at the time \nwere this hurricane to hit Miami in, say, 2010 instead and, following conventional \nmethodology, the absolute damage therefore needs to be scaled up in order to make it \ncomparable to absolute damages in 2010. Our normalization approach instead \nnormalizes each damage by the wealth that could have potentially been destroyed at \nthe time and by expressing each damage in the same invariant unit (the APLR, i.e. \nratio of actual to potential loss), no scaling up of previous disaster damages are \nrequired. Absolute damages are not comparable over time and therefore need \nadjustment along the lines of conventional methodology, but relative damages are \ndirectly comparable over time and need no further adjustment. \nOur proposed alternative normalization method is theoretically superior to \nconventional normalization because it fulfils both conditions for a valid measure of \n                                                 \n5\n  This is not an advantage of our methodology over conventional methodology since the choice \nof a normalization \u2018base\u2019 year has no substantive implication. We merely mention it to \nfacilitate understanding. \n12 \nnatural disaster loss, as defined in section 3. The sum of APLRs will be higher in \nperiod 1 than in period 0 if, ceteris paribus, more disasters of the same intensity strike \nin period 1 or if, ceteris paribus, the same number of disasters strike with higher \nintensity in period 1. The first contingency would lead to more APLRs of the same \nsize to be added up to the aggregate sum of APLRs of period 1, while the second \ncontingency would lead to the same number of APLRs, but of larger size, to be added \nup to the aggregate sum of APLRs of period 1. \n \n5. Empirical analysis of trends in disaster losses \n5.1 The Research Design \nOur period of study covers the years 1980 to 2009. In principle, estimates of loss from \nnatural disasters exist before 1980, but it is only since 1980 that these are \nsystematically, comprehensively and consistently included in Munich Re\u2019s NatCat \ndatabase (Munich Re, personal communication). The disadvantage of not being able \nto use data from further back in time is that, ceteris paribus, the shorter the time series \nof annual loss data the less likely any trend will be detected as statistically significant \n(the smaller N, the number of observations, the higher the standard error of the \nestimate). Also, the IPCC (2007a: 942) defines climate in a narrow sense \u201cas the \naverage weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean \nand variability of relevant quantities\u201d over a period of 20 to 30 years, so our time \nperiod of 30 years may be too short to identify changes in climate. \nThe NatCat database provides high quality data, but it is of course not perfect. \nEconomic damage is always estimated. Smaller disasters may be somewhat under-\nreported in the early periods relative to later periods. This would slightly bias the \nanalysis toward finding a significant upward trend in disaster loss, which we do not \n13 \nfind in our empirical analysis below. At MunchRe, several members of staff scan \ndaily international and regional sources to compile information about disaster events. \nData on economic loss and victims are collected from a variety of sources including \ngovernment representatives, relief organisations and research facilities. Information \non economic losses, however, is also based on insurance claims to MunichRe\u2019s \ncustomers, which provide the best approximation to the actual damage. Initial reports \non fatalities and losses, which are usually available in the immediate aftermath of a \ndisaster, are often highly unreliable. Therefore, data in the NatCat database is updated \ncontinuously as more accurate information becomes available, which might be even \nyears after the disaster event. Economic loss consists predominantly of damage to \nbuildings and the physical infrastructure, but also of production losses if economic \noperations are interrupted as a result of the disaster. Even price increases as a \nconsequence of demand surges in the wake of large disasters are included. \nFor two reasons, we employ both conventional normalization methodology \nand our proposed alternative. First, we wish to compare the results of the two \nmethodologies. Second, and more importantly, while we contend that our proposed \nalternative methodology is theoretically superior to conventional normalization, it \nfaces many more problems in its empirical operationalization than conventional \nnormalization, particularly if applied at the global level.  \nThe empirical problems with the theoretically correct measure of natural \ndisasters loss from equation (2) all have to do with accurately measuring the wealth \nthat can potentially be destroyed by a natural disaster, i.e. with the denominator in \nequation (2). The first problem is that there typically are no good measures of wealth \navailable, particularly for a global analysis. We therefore need to use a proxy for \nwealth, which in our case is gross domestic product (GDP). GDP has the advantage \n14 \nthat it captures well potential economic loss due to the interruption of economic \noperations as a result of a natural disaster, but it is a relatively poor proxy for the \nphysical wealth stock potentially destroyable by disasters. Whereas economic wealth \nis a stock, GDP is a flow of economic activity. Fortunately, despite GDP consisting in \npart of intangible components such as services with scant correspondence to the value \nof the physical wealth stock, on the whole GDP is highly correlated with it. But GDP \ncan only function as a proxy for wealth and typically understates it. Economists \nestimate the ratio of the value of the physical man-made or manufactured capital stock \nto GDP to lie somewhere in between 2 and 4 for a typical macro-economy (D\u2019Adda \nand Scorcu 2003). But this ratio will differ from country to country and, more \nimportantly, is a national macro-economic average, which can differ more drastically \nacross sub-country units.6 It also only captures the value of the physical capital stock \nused for the production of consumption goods and services, but not the value of other \nwealth held in the form of, for example, residential property. Moreover, the increasing \nshare of GDP consisting of intangible components such as services, which is observed \nin many, but not all, countries implies that the growth rate of GDP possibly over-\nestimates the growth rate of the physical wealth stock. This will bias the results \nagainst finding a positive trend since disasters from past periods are scaled up too \nstrongly as a result of normalization. \nThe second problem stems from defining the area potentially affected by a \nnatural disaster, which determines the boundaries of wealth (or GDP) to be included \nin the denominator of equation (2). Few natural disasters affect an entire country such \nthat the country\u2019s total GDP could be taken as the proxy for potential wealth to be \n                                                 \n6\n  It has also changed over time (see D\u2019Adda and Scorcu 2003), but Krugman (1992: 54f.) \nconcludes that \u201cthere is a remarkable constancy of the capital-output ratio across countries; \nthere is also a fairly stable capital-output ratio in advanced nations. These constancies have \nbeen well known for a long time and were in fact at the heart of the famous Solow conclusion \nthat technological change, not capital accumulation, is the source of most growth.\u201d \n15 \ndestroyed. Disasters are more likely to affect a smaller area. The problem is that it is \nvery difficult to know the exact affected area for each natural disaster. In our analysis, \nwe resort to the extreme simplifying assumption that each disaster affects an equally \nsized area of 100 x 100 kilometres, i.e. 10,000 square kilometres arranged equally \naround the reported centre of the disaster. This introduces some measurement error \nand, potentially, some bias.7 In future research, we will tackle this issue and we will \nattempt to measure the affected area more adequately contingent on specific natural \ndisasters and\/or specific countries or regions looked at. \nReaders will wonder why these empirical problems do not equally affect \nconventional normalization methodology. The answer is that they do affect \nconventional methodology, but differently and arguably less so. Conventional \nnormalization also suffers from, depending on the unit of analysis and the quality of \navailable data, having to resort to proxy measures of wealth and not knowing the \nexact affected areas. But since conventional normalization only adjusts for changes in \nwealth over time, rather than levels of wealth across time and space, it suffers less \nfrom these problems. The assumption that growth in GDP is a good approximation for \ngrowth in wealth in all areas affected by natural disasters is less restrictive than the \nassumption that the GDP to wealth ratio is the same in all affected areas. Similarly, if \nconventional normalization does not capture the true affected area, but takes some \n                                                 \n7\n  The measurement error could be non-random (i.e. systematically under- or overestimating the \ntrue affected area relatively more in earlier or later periods), but is more likely to be random. It \ncould be non-random if, for example, one is willing to make the assumption that climate \nchange leads to larger areas being affected over time such that our approximation would tend \nto under-estimate the affected area relatively more in later compared to earlier periods. Since \nthis would lead us to over-estimate normalized damage in later periods and we mostly fail to \nfind significant upward trends in normalized damage, we are not much concerned about this \nspecific type of non-random measurement error. Random measurement error will lead to \nattenuation bias of the estimated coefficient toward zero and thus will make it less likely that \nwe will find a statistically significant trend. A similar problem plagues the conventional \nnormalization method, however. Its failure to account for spatial heterogeneity introduces a \nkind of measurement error. Even when this is random measurement error, the analysis will be \nsomewhat biased against finding a significant trend. This caveat should be kept in mind when \ninterpreting the findings of this and previous studies. \n16 \nproxy thereof, then the error this introduces derives from the fact that the change in \nwealth in the truly affected area can be different from the change in wealth in the area \nassumed to be affected. The bias in growth rates is likely to be much smaller than the \nbias in absolute levels of wealth, which is the relevant bias for our proposed \nalternative normalization approach. \nIn sum, while normalization according to equation (2) is theoretically superior \nto normalization according to equation (1), our proposed alternative faces many more \nproblems in empirical operationalization. We therefore regard it as complementary to \nconventional normalization, definitely not as a substitute. If both normalization \nmethods lead to similar results, then we can be more confident in the results. \nIn the remainder of this section, we describe our empirical research design in \nmore detail. For the results generated with our alternative method, the starting point is \nGDP data taken from the G-Econ project (G-Econ 2010), which provides worldwide \ninformation on GDP in purchasing power parity, on a one degree latitude\/one degree \nlongitude resolution. GDP data in purchasing power parity is preferable to GDP \nestimates at exchange rates known to under-state GDP in poorer countries. Data is \navailable for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. The dataset, developed by Nordhaus et al. \n(2006) builds on previously established data for the gridded population of the world \nand contains a cell-level equivalent to GDP. Data comes from various sources at \ndifferent levels of spatial disaggregation, such as regional GDP information, regional \nincome and employment by industry, or regional urban and rural population or \nemployment along with sectoral data on agricultural and non-agricultural incomes. If \nregional data is not available, as is the case for many of the lowest-income countries \nparticularly in Africa, spatial distribution of population is taken to impute a spatial \n17 \nGDP distribution (Nordhaus et al. 2006). To create gridded data, information is then \nspatially rescaled from political boundaries to geophysical boundaries. \nIn a first step, we filled the gaps in time by intra-polation assuming a constant \ngrowth rate. We then extrapolated the values backwards to 1980 and forward to 2009, \nbased on country growth rates, adjusted for differences in cell-level growth rates to \naccount for the fact that some regions, for instance urban centers, grow at a faster \npace than others. For backward extrapolation, we average annual country growth rates \nwith the cell growth rate between 1990 and 1995, while for forward extrapolation we \naverage annual country growth rates with the cell growth rate between 2000 and 2005. \nAs a consequence, cells that grew faster than the country average between 1990 and \n1995 are also assumed to have grown faster than the country as a whole between 1980 \nand 1989, while cells that grew faster than the country average between 2000 and \n2005 are also assumed to grow faster than average after 2005 to 2009. \nWith increasing distance from the equator, the size of a one degree \nlongitude\/one degree latitude cell decreases. To correct for this, all cells are rescaled \nto a cell size of 100 x 100 kilometres, i.e. 10,000 square kilometres, leaving the \nproportion of land mass in each cell unchanged. This is equivalent to modelling a \nquadrangular world. Under the assumption of an equal distribution of GDP within a \ncell, we then divided each cell into nine subcells of the same size. For the largest \nnumber of events, the NatCat database provides a geo-reference of the centre of the \ndisaster. The affected area of an event is taken to have the size of nine subcells, which \nis equal to the original size of one cell.8 How the subcells are chosen depends on \nwhere the centre of the disaster lies with respect to the gridded GDP-cells. Figure 1a \nillustrates an example on the Northern hemisphere east of the zero meridian, in which \n                                                 \n8\n  While we have tested for the effect of assuming different sizes of affected areas and found \nresults to be robust, in future research, we will adjust the size of the assumed affected area, \nmaking it contingent on the type of natural disaster analyzed. \n18 \nthe centre of the disaster is in the North-Eastern subcell of a one degree latitude\/one \ndegree longitude cell. We calculated the affected area as the sum of four subcells in \nthe cell in which the disaster took place, plus two subcells of the cell adjacent in the \nNorth, one subcell of the cell in the North-East, and two subcells of the cell in the \nEast. In 11.7 percent of the cases the geo-reference lies on the intersection of one \ndegree latitude and one degree longitude, which might be due to data inaccuracy. As \nillustrated in Figure 1b, in these cases the affected area is simply the sum of the four \nadjacent cells divided by four. Consequently, a quarter of the affected area comes \nfrom each of the four adjacent cells in these cases. \nSince GDP data provided by G-Econ (2010) is in constant 1995 international \ndollar we deflated the disaster losses to year 1995 values, which are expressed in \nnominal USD in NatCat, using the US GDP deflator. The normalized damage is then \ncalculated by dividing the deflated losses by the GDP of the affected area. This gives \nthe APLR for each disaster. Note that these APLRs are not bound from above by one \nbecause GDP is only a proxy of wealth, which often will be several times larger than \nGDP. Out of 19,360 disasters for which we have APLRs, 204 are above one. \nHowever, in a very few cases we arrive at implausibly high APLRs where the loss in \nrelation to the assumed affected area is far too large to be plausible. In these cases, the \ncentre of disaster is usually located in a very sparsely populated area or on a small \nisland. This might indicate a coding error in the geo-referencing. In addition, wide-\nranging disasters such as droughts and wildfires are over-represented in the list of \ndisasters with top APLRs. For such disasters, it is hard to identify the centre and the \nassumed affected area might be much smaller than the truly affected area. We decided \nto drop 20 (out of 19,360) disasters with an APLR over 50. While this choice is \n19 \nsomewhat arbitrary, our results are not affected by choosing a lower threshold.9 They \nalso remain valid if we do not exclude these events from the analysis.  \nTo arrive at the annual aggregate,10 the sum of APLRs of disasters happening \nin one year is taken.11 To test for the existence of a trend, the time-variant sum of \nAPLRs from each year is regressed on a linear year variable and an intercept: \n[Annual sum of APLRs] t  = \u03b10 + \u03b21year t  + t\u03b5     (3) \nA trend is statistically significant if the null hypothesis that \u03b21 is equal to zero can be \nrejected at the ten percent level or lower. From a statistical point of view, this \napproach is potentially problematic, but we found the results to be robust to \nalternative approaches.12 \nFor the conventional normalization approach, we normalised disaster losses to \n2009 values by multiplying the original disaster damage, which is expressed in \nnominal USD in NatCat, with three multipliers each accounting for the change in \nproducer price levels (using the US GDP deflator), as well as the changes in the \ncountry\u2019s population and GDP per capita in purchasing power parity, respectively. \nWe use country level data for population and GDP from World Bank (2010). To test \n                                                 \n9\n  We tested various cut-off levels down to an APLR of more than 1.5. \n10\n  Scholars so far have typically aggregated damage figures to annual aggregates. However, it is \nnot clear that annual aggregates are necessarily more appropriate than, say, monthly \naggregates. We repeated our analysis using monthly aggregates and generally found no more \nevidence for increasing trends than with the annual aggregates. \n11\n  We took the onset of a disaster as the relevant information for the year of occurrence. Most \ndisasters are short-lived. \n12\n  To understand why from a statistical point of view the approach taken is potentially \nproblematic, note that the APLRs consist of the ratio of two rather random variables, the loss \nand the associated gross cell product (GCP) value, and the distribution of the annual sum of \nAPLRs is likely to have a so-called \u201cfat tail\u201d. In our context, these fat tails appear, for \nexample, if a disaster hits a very sparsely populated area with a very low GCP in the \ndenominator. A consequence of fat tail distributed data series is that the trend detection power \nof common statistical tests might be low because a weak trend signal could be drowned out by \nthe highly volatile fat tail data. As an alternative to our method, one can compensate for very \nlarge and very small APLR-outliers by summing the total disaster losses and the total affected \nGCP per year before calculating the ratio. This alternative measure mitigates the problem of \nheavy tails but comes at the cost of being a pure intensity measure as it neglects disaster \nfrequency. We found no more evidence for significant trends in normalized disaster loss using \nthis alternative to our preferred method, but we will tackle in more detail the question of the \ntrend detecting power of different normalization methods in future research. \n20 \nfor the existence of a trend, the annual sum of normalized disaster losses from each \nyear is regressed on a linear year variable and an intercept: \n[Annual sum of damage] 2009t  = \u03b10 + \u03b21year t  + t\u03b5     (4) \nAs before, a trend is statistically significant if the null hypothesis that \u03b21 is equal to \nzero can be rejected at the ten percent level or lower. Robust standard errors are \nemployed in all estimations. \n \n5.2 Results \nWe start by showing non-normalized natural disaster loss at the global level, where \nloss is merely adjusted for inflation (see figure 2). There is a clear and statistically \nsignificant upward trend.13 The question is: does this finding uphold if disaster loss is \nnormalized? \nFigure 3 shows loss from all natural disasters at the global level once \nnormalized according to the conventional method and once normalized according to \nthe alternative method. Whereas figure 2 covers all natural disasters, we lose some \ndisasters (roughly 6 per cent) when normalizing loss due to lack of data.14 To ensure \ncomparability when contrasting results, the same sample is used for both \nnormalization approaches. The graphs look somewhat different, as one would expect \ngiven the differences in underlying methodology. Normalized according to \nconventional method, there is no statistically significant trend, whereas there is a \n                                                 \n13\n  The coefficient and t-value of \u03b21 in equation (3) and the corresponding p-value are displayed \nat the bottom of each figure. Due to the devastating hurricane Katrina, which hit densely \npopulated and wealthy areas on the South East coast of the USA in August 2005, this year \nshows extraordinarily high inflation-adjusted losses. Since this outlier is toward the end of the \nobserved period, it could pivot the trend line upwards and inflate the significance of the trend. \nHowever, if we drop the year 2005, then the coefficient drops to 2.79, but the trend remains \nstatistically significant at the five percent level (p-value: 0.012).  \n14\n  Figure 2 looks similar and the significantly positive trend remains if we restrict the sample of \ndisasters to the ones for which we undertake normalization. \n21 \ndownward trend, significant at the 10 per cent level, according to the alternative \nmethod. \nFor the purpose of detecting a climate change signal, it makes no sense to \ninclude loss from all natural disasters since some disaster types will be practically \nunaffected by climate change. In figure 4, we therefore have taken out geophysical \ndisasters (earthquakes, land slides, rock falls, subsidence, volcanic eruptions, and \ntsunamis) and only include the following disaster types: blizzards, hail storms, \nlightning, local windstorms, sandstorms, tropical cyclones, severe storms, tornados, \nwinter storms, avalanches, flash floods, general floods, storm surges, cold and heat \nwaves, droughts, winter damages, and wildfires. Both methods lead to the same result \nas for all disasters: no significant trend over time according to conventional method, a \nmarginally significant downward trend according to the alternative method. If the \nvery small number of disasters with very large APLRs above 50 are kept in the \nsample, the negative trend loses its significance (p-value of 0.115). \nClimate change will not affect all regions or countries at different stages of \ndevelopment equally and in the same way. In figures 5a to 5f we therefore look at \ndeveloped vis-\u00e0-vis developing countries as well as at specific regions of the world, \nemploying the same list of weather-related disasters as in figure 4. Looking at \ndeveloped nations first (figure 5a), no significant trend is found with the conventional \napproach, but a relatively strong negative trend, which is statistically significant at the \none percent level, is found using the alternative method.15 In contrast, the analysis \nyields no significant trends using either method for developing countries (figure 5b). \nThis could possibly indicate a stronger capability of richer nations to fund defensive \n                                                 \n15\n  Interestingly, while hurricane Katrina is the major reason for conventionally normalized loss \nin 2005 to represent the largest loss in developed countries over the period 1980 to 2009, the \nsum of APLRs for 2005 is not even in the top three over this period. The reason is that while \nKatrina caused a very large economic loss, it also hit a relatively wealthy part of the \ndeveloped world. \n22 \nmitigating measures, which decrease vulnerability to natural disasters over time. As \nshown in figure 5c, the negative and significant trend is prevalent when normalizing \nwith the alternative method for the US and Canada.16 For all other selected regions, \nnamely Western Europe (figure 5d), Latin America and the Caribbean (figure 5e), as \nwell as South and East Asia and Pacific countries (figure 5f), no statistically \nsignificant trend is found under either approach. \nClimate change also need not affect all climate-related disasters equally and in \nthe same way. In figures 6a to 6d we therefore look at specific disaster types at the \nglobal level. For convective events (figure 6a), that is, damages from flash floods, hail \nstorms, tempest storms, tornados, and lightning, there is no statistically significant \ntrend, according to either normalization approaches. The same result is found for \nstorm events (figure 6b) and for tropical cyclones (figure 6c). For precipitation-related \nevents (figure 6d), we find no trend with the conventional approach, but a negative \ntrend with the alternative method, which is significant at the ten percent level. \nThere is concern about specific climate-related disasters affecting specific \nregions, which is not sufficiently addressed by any of the analysis reported above. In \nfigures 7a to 7d, we therefore look at specific disaster events in specific regions or \ncountries. To begin with, Figure 7a displays disaster losses from convective events in \nthe US. For the United States, data quality in the NatCat dataset is high also for earlier \nyears back to 1970. We therefore are able to cover 40 years in this analysis. If losses \nare normalized according to the conventional method, a positive and statistically \nsignificant trend can be established. With the alternative method, however, the \npositive trend is marginally insignificant (p-value of 0.129). For the same disaster \ntype in Europe, on the other hand, no significant trend is discernible after \n                                                 \n16\n  The trend remains statistically significant at the five percent level if the large value in the year \n1984 is excluded. \n23 \nnormalization with either approach (figure 7b). Disaster losses caused by hurricanes \nin the US and in the Central American and Caribbean region have been subject to \nvarious focussed studies (Pielke and Landsea 1998, Pielke et al. 2003, Nordhaus \n2006, Pielke et al. 2008).17 We do not find a significant trend either in the United \nStates (figure 7c) or in Central America and the Caribbean (figure 7d), independent of \nthe normalisation approach applied. At face value, the result for the US contradicts \nstudies, which have found an upward trend in US hurricane losses since the 1970s \n(e.g,, Schmidt, Kemfert and H\u00f6ppe 2009). Note, however, that the trend with the \nconventional normalization approach is not too far from statistical significance (p-\nvalue of 0.166).18  \n \n6. Defensive mitigating measures \nOne of the problems with normalizing damage from natural disasters, independently \nof the method chosen, is our inability to take into account defensive mitigating \nmeasures, which rational individuals would undertake in response to an increasing \nfrequency and\/or intensity of natural hazards. An increase in such measures could \nprevent an increasing trend in natural disaster loss that would otherwise occur in the \nabsence of such measures and could thus prevent detection of a potential climate \nchange signal in the data. For example, flood defence measures in Western Europe \nhave dramatically reduced the risk of flood damages from winter storms (e.g., Lavery \nand Donovan (2005) on the River Thames tidal defences or Ronde et al. (2003) on \nflood defence development in the Netherlands), while stricter building codes \nintroduced in parts of coastal Florida from the mid-1990s onwards have significantly \n                                                 \n17\n  Nordhaus (2006) finds a positive and significant trend in normalised tropical cyclone losses in \nthe United States.  \n18\n  Moreover, if we restrict our analysis to the exact same time period as Schmidt, Kemfert and \nH\u00f6ppe (2009) and regress, as they do, the log of normalized loss (rather than loss itself) on \nyears, then we also find a significant trend. \n24 \nreduced hurricane damage from Hurricane Charley in 2004 (Institute for Business and \nHome Safety 2008). Our findings of a downward trend in natural disaster loss with \nthe alternative method for all natural disasters and for all non-geophysical disasters at \nthe global level could be driven by such measures. Splitting up the sample into \ndeveloped versus developing countries, we find a strong and more clearly statistically \nsignificant downward trend for developed countries, but no trend whatsoever for \ndeveloping countries. This would also be consistent with increased defensive \nmitigating measures since developed countries are much better able to fund such \nmeasures than developing countries. To be sure, increased mitigating measures are \nonly one possible explanation for the findings, but not the only one. \nWith the possible exception of Crompton and McAneney (2008) who study \none specific type of natural disaster in one single country, due to lack of data no \nexisting study has been able to adequately take defensive mitigating measures into \naccount, and neither can we. Instead, we offer evidence on trends in the frequency of \nnatural disasters, which could tentatively point in the direction that such measures are \nincreasingly undertaken. To this effect, figure 8 shows trends in the simple count of \ndisasters, once for weather-related and once for geophysical disasters not related to \nweather. There seems to be a clear upward trend in the frequency count of weather-\nrelated disasters. There is also an upward trend in the frequency count of geophysical \ndisasters. However, the trend line for weather-related disaster counts suggests more \nthan a doubling over the period 1980 to 2009, whereas the trend line for geophysical \ndisasters suggests only a small percentage increase over this period. A natural \nquestion is whether this strongly increasing trend in the frequency count of weather-\nrelated disasters is driven by increased awareness and reporting of natural disasters in \nlater compared to earlier periods as well as by new settlements in areas that were \n25 \nuninhabited before as populations and economies grow and where the same natural \nhazard would have gone unrecorded (no damage) before. To check this, in figure 9 we \nrepeat the exercise from figure 8, but this time restricting the analysis to major \ndisasters, for which a reporting bias is less likely. Major disasters are defined as \ndisasters that exceed a property damage value, which is linearly interpolated from 85 \nmillion USD in 1980 to 200 million USD in 2009, or exceed a (time-invariant) fatality \nlevel of 100 people killed. As before, there is a clear upward trend in the frequency \ncount of major weather-related disasters, but there is also an upward trend in the count \nof major geophysical disasters. As before, the frequency count of weather-related \ndisasters increases relatively more than the frequency count of geophysical disasters. \nHowever, since there is no physical reason why the frequency count of major \ngeophysical disasters should have increased, some reporting bias is likely to remain \npresent even for major disasters, unless the increase can be fully explained by there \nbeing fewer uninhabited areas available in later periods. It is impossible to say how \nlarge this reporting bias is, but there could well be some increase in the frequency of \nweather-related disasters beyond what can be explained by reporting bias. \nInterestingly, one observes a similar upward trend in the frequency of weather-related \ndisasters, both all and major ones only, for a country like Germany, in which \nreporting bias is not very likely and where no major expansion of population into \npreviously unsettled areas has taken place over the period of our study (no figures \nshown, but available upon request). \nIndependently of the reason behind the strong increase in the frequency count \nof weather-related disasters over our period of analysis, how can this be reconciled \nwith our finding of no upward trend in normalized damage from natural disasters? \nThere are three possibilities. First, there could be an opposite reporting bias in terms \n26 \nof damage caused such that economic loss is over-estimated in the early years of our \nstudy period and under-estimated in the later years. Second, weather-related natural \ndisasters could have become less intensive over time. Third, weather-related natural \ndisasters have not become less intensive, but defensive mitigating measures have \nprevented increasingly frequent weather-related natural disasters from causing an \nupward trend in normalized natural disaster loss. Since there is little reason to \npresume that loss has been systematically over-estimated in the past or that weather-\nrelated natural disasters have become less intensive, the third explanation presents a \ndistinct possibility. \n \n7. Conclusion \nIn this article, we have analyzed whether one can detect an increasing trend in \nhistorical data on economic damage from natural disasters. We have argued that the \nconventional method used for normalization is theoretically problematic as it fails to \nnormalize for a spatially heterogeneous distribution of wealth which renders absolute \nlosses from different locations non-comparable to each other. We have proposed an \nalternative method, which normalizes disaster loss for both differences in space and \ntime. The actual-to-potential loss (APLR) ratio provides a theoretically correct and \nvalid normalization method for economic disaster loss. Contrary to conventional \nnormalization, our proposed alternative is valid for the purpose of detecting a climate \nsignal in the sense that it will always attribute a higher value to periods in which, \nceteris paribus, more disasters of the same intensity take place or the same number of \ndisasters strike with higher intensity. Yet, our theoretically correct measure of disaster \nloss encounters many more practical difficulties than the conventional normalization \n27 \nmethod, particularly if applied at the global level. We have therefore undertaken our \nanalysis with both methods, regarding them as complements, not substitutes. \n Independently of the method used, we find no significant upward trend in \nnormalized disaster loss. This holds true whether we include all disasters or take out \nthe ones unlikely to be affected by a changing climate. It also holds true if we step \naway from a global analysis and look at specific regions or step away from pooling all \ndisaster types and look at specific types of disaster instead or combine these two sets \nof dis-aggregated analysis. \n Much caution is required in correctly interpreting these findings. What the \nresults tell us is that, based on historical data, there is no evidence so far that climate \nchange has increased the normalized economic loss from natural disasters. More \ncannot be inferred from the data. In particular, one cannot infer from our analysis that \nthere have not been more frequent and\/or more intensive weather-related natural \ndisasters.19 Our analysis necessarily cannot take into account defensive mitigating \nmeasures undertaken by rational individuals and governments and a serious attempt at \ntrying to collect data on such measures should top the priority list for future research. \nSuch measures would translate into lower economic damage compared to the damage \nin the absence of defensive mitigation and if mitigating measures have increased and \nstrengthened over time then this increasing trend toward mitigation could well mask \nan increasing trend in natural disaster loss over time. Our finding of an increasing \ntrend in the frequency count of weather-related disasters, including only major ones, \ntentatively points in the direction of an increasing trend toward such defensive \nmitigating measures, unless the trend were fully explained by reporting bias. Besides \nthe issue of defensive mitigating measures, another caveat to keep in mind in making \n                                                 \n19\n  In fact, our frequency count of weather-related natural disasters suggests increasing rather \nthan decreasing frequency of such disasters. \n28 \ninferences from our analysis is that it is based on historical data. Available evidence \nsuggests that climatic change has only just begun and that it will take many years and \ndecades still before its consequences will be truly felt (IPCC 2007a, 2007b). If so, the \npast will be a poor guide to the future. \nIn sum, while we find no evidence for an increasing trend in normalized \neconomic damage from natural disasters, this provides no reason for complacency. \nThat inflation-adjusted non-normalized disaster damage is significantly increasing \nshould prompt policy-makers into seriously considering measures to prevent the \nfurther accumulation of wealth in disaster-prone areas. More importantly for the \ndebate on climate change, our results do not undermine the argument of those who, \nbased on the precautionary principle, call for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in \norder to prevent or reduce a potentially increasing economic toll from natural disasters \nin the future. We find no evidence for an increasing trend in the normalized economic \ntoll from natural disasters based on historical data, but given our inability to control \nfor defensive mitigating measures we cannot rule out its existence, let alone rule out \nthe possibility of an increasing trend in the future. \n29 \nReferences \nBarredo, J.I., 2009, Normalised flood losses in Europe: 1970\u20132006, Natural Hazards \nand Earth Systems Sciences, 9, pp. 97-104. \nBouwer, Laurens M., 2009, Have past disaster losses increased due to anthropogenic \nclimate change?, Amsterdam: VU University. \nBrooks, Harold E. and Charles A.
