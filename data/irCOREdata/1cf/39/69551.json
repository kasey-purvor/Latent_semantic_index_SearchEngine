Introduction\n[2] The magnetotail plasma sheet shows complicated\ndynamics around the time of substorm onset in the near-\nEarth tail region which holds important information about\nthe mechanism of explosive instability which triggers the\nonset. The gross configuration changes [e.g., McPherron et\nal., 1973] include the magnetic field dipolarization, plasma\nsheet expansion and inward plasma injection in the dipole-\nlike inner region (roughly, within 10 Re), which are thought\nto be closely related to the diversion of a part of the plasma\nsheet dawn-to-dusk current via the ionosphere (the so-called\nsubstorm current wedge, SCW). Further downtail, in the\nmidtail region, the plasma sheet current starts to be dis-\nrupted (as revealed by the lobe magnetic field decrease\n[Caan et al., 1978]) and fast plasma flows are generated,\nwhereas the plasma\/current sheet configuration often dis-\nplays a fast thinning [Hones et al., 1984]. These changes are\noften interpreted as an indication of explosive onset of\nmagnetic reconnection [Nagai et al., 1998]. However, the\nonset phenomena are highly variable and localized so they\ncould not be fully observed and described with previous\nscarce spacecraft and ground coverage. Consequently, the\nbasic morphological questions concerning the exact time\nsequence of the phenomena in different regions (at time\nresolution better than a couple of minutes) remain contro-\nversial. The answer to questions concerning the origin of the\nexplosive tail instability is a basic goal of the Time History\nof Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms\n(THEMIS) mission.\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A00C02, doi:10.1029\/2008JA013527, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1St. Petersburg State University, St. Petersburg, Russia.\n2Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, California, USA.\n3Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley,\nCalifornia, USA.\n4NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland, USA.\n5Finnish Meteorological Institute, Helsinki, Finland.\n6Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2008JA013527$09.00\nA00C02 1 of 11\n[3] A special interest in that respect is the transition\nregion at \u000110\u201312 Re in the tail separating the dipole-like\nand tail-like plasma tube configurations, which approxi-\nmately correspond to a demarcation line between the source\nregions in the groups of Inside!Out models (instability\nstarts in the inner region, and may then stimulate the\nreconnection further down the tail) and Outside!In models\n(midtail reconnection starts first and send flows to the inner\nregion) [Ohtani, 2004]. This region is thought to be close to\nthe heart of the current disruption and also a potential region\nof the braking of the fast Earthward flows launched from the\ntail [e.g., Kepko et al., 2001]. However, the substorm onset-\nrelated phenomena in this key region were not previously\nstudied as systematically as it was done in the midtail or in\nthe geosynchronous region, so the question (What is going\non in this region during the first minutes around onset\ntime?) is still basically unanswered. It is why we choose as a\nmain objective of our particular study to investigate the\nperturbations near the outward PS boundary (including\nadjacent lobes) at \u000111Re during simultaneous observations\nof the inward injection and ground-based phenomena on the\nsame meridian. Our goals here are (1) to describe the\nconfigurational changes in the PS boundary region, (2) to\nestablish a time sequence between the perturbations in this\nregion comparing to the inner region (between GEO and\n9 Re) and ground phenomena, and (3) to discuss the con-\nstraints on the choice of onset instability as seen by the\nobserver at 11 Re.\n[4] In the following we analyze a case of two subsequent\nsubstorm onsets observed by two THEMIS spacecraft\nideally located (for our goals) on the outbound part of their\ntrajectory. These events are also ideal because they had very\ndistinct onsets in all phenomena, at both spacecraft and on\nthe ground, and because both spacecraft and the conjugate\nground MIRACLE network made observations inside the\nsubstorm current wedge (SCW) sector. To support our\ninterpretation we also show some additional material from\nother events and present the results of MHD simulations.\n2. Observations on 27 December 2007\n[5] The THEMIS mission was previously described by\nAngelopoulos et al. [2008]. Here we used observations from\nthe magnetometer (FGM), the particle spectrometers (ESA\nand SST) and from the electric field double probe. These\ninstruments are described in the special issue of Space\nScience Reviews, 2008.\n[6] The two events of interest occurred at the end of the\nday on 27 December 2007, when the probes P1 and P2\npassed outbound near the midnight meridian plane after\ntheir perigee (Figure 1). At the times of onset (\u00012132 UT\nand \u00012219 UT) the P1 spacecraft was \u00011.5 Re below the\nneutral sheet and probed the plasma sheet near its outer\nboundary at the distance of 11 and 12 Re, respectively.\nProbe P2 passed near the neutral sheet (jdZj < 0.4 Re) and\nnear the inner PS boundary during the first onset (being at\n7.4 Re), or inside the innermost portion of the inner plasma\nsheet (at 8.7 Re) during the second onset; see Figure 1 (top).\nThe data come at 3 sec spin resolution in the slow data\nstorage mode, which excludes the detailed study of the\ndistribution functions in these events.\n[7] Ground activity started in the quiet background dur-\ning the northward (but small) IMF Bz and solar wind flow\npressure of 2 nPa (Figure 2). The electrojet index of the\nImage magnetometer network (midnight at \u00012140 UT for\nthe central meridian chain) indicates the modest electrojet\nenhancements with AL peak values of\u0004450 nTand\u0004150 nT\nand isolated onsets. The magnetic bays are also very distinct\nin the midlatitude variations: positive H bays and D varia-\ntions of different signs with intense Pi2 components (shown\nin Figure 2) are good for accurate timing and quantitative\nanalysis. Using the midlatitude magnetic variations of\n16 Intermagnet stations (distributed between 1800 and\n0600 MLT on the nightside) as inputs to determine the\nintensity and longitudes of the substorm current wedge (see\nSergeev et al. [1996] for the description of the procedure)\nwe reconstructed the SCW parameters for both onsets, using\nthe magnetic field values at 2131 and 2218 UT as the\nreference levels for the variations. Although the current\nwedges in the two events were of different peak magnitude\n(0.3 and 0.2 MA, correspondingly) and of different width\nand locations (see Figure 1, bottom), the spacecraft foot-\npoint longitudes (close to midnight) as well as the central\nmeridian of the Image network (local midnight at\u00012140 UT)\nfall well inside of the developing substorm current wedges,\nand thus, fairly well inside of the substorm active sector.\nFigure 1. (top) XZ-GSM locations of P1 and P2 space-\ncraft at two substorm onsets, (middle) the keogram (zenith\nangle versus time) of the auroral brightness at Long-\nyearbyen (LYR, located at 75\u0001 CGLat), and (bottom) total\nSCW current and MLT locations of the westward and\neastward edges of the substorm current wedge reconstructed\nfrom magnetic variations observed at 16 midlatitude Inter-\nmagnet stations.\nA00C02 SERGEEV ET AL.: THEMIS OBSERVATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSETS\n2 of 11\nA00C02\n[8] The digital ASC auroral measurements for this event\nare only available from Longyearbyen station (LYR, 75.1\u0001\nCGLat, 113\u0001CGLon) situated near the poleward border of\nthe auroral oval (see Figure 1, middle). Although these\nmeasurements are useless for the precise substorm onset\ntiming, they document a strong poleward expansion of\nbright active auroras during the times when the P1 space-\ncraft probed the inward motion of the outer plasma sheet\nboundary. According to the Image magnetograms, the onset\nlatitude was at \u000167\u0001, slightly southward of Nordkap station\nas follows from initial small positive dZ excursion observed\nhere at both onsets. The poleward expansion peak reaches\n\u000173\u0001 (72\u0001) CGLat (at 2142 and 2233 UT) indicating a\nrather strong and fast poleward auroral expansion during the\nperiod when the P1 probe made observations in the lobe\nregion (see below).\n[9] Both THEMIS spacecraft observed distinct positive\nbay-like Bz variations of similar shape (Figure 2); however,\nthe behavior of plasma parameters at spacecraft separated\nby only \u00013 Re distance differs drastically (see Figure 3).\nFigure 2. (top) Survey of time-shifted solar wind parameters (Vz, flow pressure and Bz, from high-\nresolution OMNI database), (middle) ground magnetic perturbations at nightside (Image electrojet index\nand magnetograms of subauroral near-midnight SAMNET stations), and (bottom) spacecraft observations\nof magnetic field at THEMIS spacecraft together with energetic electron injection observed at LANL-\n02A spacecraft. The local time of LANL-02A spacecraft was 01.90 h MLT at 2132 UT.\nA00C02 SERGEEV ET AL.: THEMIS OBSERVATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSETS\n3 of 11\nA00C02\nWhereas the innermost probe P2 observed the arrival of\naccelerated plasma soon after the onset times, probe P1\ninstead showed \u000110 min-long plasma dropouts in both\ncases, indicating that the probe exited from the plasma\nsheet to the lobes. Let us consider in more detail the initial\nonsets and lobe periods at P1 which display a lot of\ninteresting activities.\n[10] Figure 4 provides the time series of basic parameters\nfrom particle and field experiments at the plasma sheet\u2013\nlobe interface. The onset of the first isolated event was very\ndistinct and related phenomena occurred simultaneously in\nthe magnetic and electric fields, at around 2131:35(\u00b110 s).\nAt this time the Bz component started its positive excursion,\nand the Bx component dropped in magnitude. In terms of\ntotal energy (magnetic plus plasma pressure, equivalent to\nthe lobe energy density) the last variation implies a signif-\nicant loss of the lobe magnetic pressure by 10% in a half\nminute (see Figure 4, bottom). The magnetic pressure\ncontinued to decrease during the next several minutes when\nthe probe P1 was already in the lobe. A very distinct and\nstrong negative Ey field in satellite (DSL [see Angelopoulos,\n2008]) coordinates, reaching 3 mV\/m in a half minute,\ncorresponds to the appearance of strong dawn-to-dusk\n(positive GSM) electric field near the spacecraft. This\nmay imply a fast upward plasma motion (Vz in Figure 4)\nas the origin of fast disappearance (thinning, or upward\nlifting) of the plasma sheet which was noticed a minute after\nthe onset. This strong Ey, indicating the fast flux transport\nand enhanced dissipation in the tail, was the dominant E\nfield component. Similar manifestations, including a drop of\nthe total (lobe) pressure, an increases in GSM Bz and GSM\nEy (although more smooth and weak) are confirmed for the\nsecond event. The inferred onset times of particular onset\nphenomena will later be summarized in Table 1.\n[11] Approximately 2 and 4 min after the onsets, corre-\nspondingly, probe P1 exited into the lobe for 6\u20138 min in\nboth events. However, the lobe intervals were not the quiet\nperiods. The total pressure continued to decrease, although\nat smaller rate compared to its drop at the onset. The Bz\ncomponent continued to grow (increasing finally to as much\nas 15 nT in the first event) and the Ey component remained\nlarge and directed dawn-to-dusk. These field variations\ncontain a noticeable impulsive component at 1 min time\nscale, which is a dominant feature of the first episode, with\ncorrelating Bz and Ey GSM components.

However,\nthe ion spectrometer frequently detected the intense and\nalmost monoenergetic ions with energy varying in time\nfrom tens to hundreds of eV. This energy is displayed by red\ncircles in Figure 4 (top). Owing to the slow sampling rate\nmode only one distribution function was available in 3 min.\nA single example was available during the monoenergetic\nion event (at 213330 UT) and exhibited a tailward compo-\nnent as well as a significant component perpendicular to B.\nTo test whether the variations of monoenergetic beam\nenergy reflect the cross-B convective motion of the cold\nplasma as previously observed by Cluster [e.g., Sauvaud et\nal., 2004] and THEMIS [McFadden et al., 2008], we\ncomputed the Vz expected from the electric drift motion\ntaking into account only one flow component, namely, Vz =\nEy\/Bx. From that we calculate the kinetic energy of this\ncross-field motion, Wi = mpVz\n2\/2, assuming that ions are\nprotons. A comparison in Figure 4 (top) justifies our\nexpectation: the beam energies are in a range compatible\nwith the energy of the proton electric drift motion, and the\nobserved time variations closely follow our predictions. As\na result of this successful test we learned that (1) cold ions\nare protons, (2) the magnetic fields are frozen into the\nplasma, (3) the measurements of the electric field Ey\ncomponent are reliable even in the lobes, and (4) there are\nreal fast upward plasma tube convective motions in the\nlobes at r \u0001 10 Re toward the plasma sheet center.

Compared to the onset times at P1 the first signa-\ntures of activity at P2 (slow Earthward and a stronger\nduskward flow, and a slow pressure increase) are delayed\nby 20\u201330 s in the first event, and the major injection started\na minute later. In the second event the first appearance of a\nweak Earthward-then-dawnward-then-tailward flow and\nslow pressure increase were nearly simultaneous with the\nstart of activity at P1. However, in this case, the absence of\nconvective flow implies that these flows may be associated\nwith the plasma injection mainly along the flux tube, rather\nFigure 5.

A major injection of plasma\ntubes in the second event was observed after 2221 UT,\nsimultaneously with the Ey increase and fast plasma sheet\nthinning at P1 (Figure 4). Although the details of plasma\ninjection into the inner magnetosphere will be the subject of\na subsequent paper, we briefly emphasize one remarkable\nfeature. In the first event (P2 was near the dusk edge of the\nSCW, Figure 1) the azimuthal flow was duskward, whereas\nin the second event (P2 was near the dawn SCW edge) it\nwas dawnward. This possibly indicates a flow diversion\nassociated with the localized (in MLT) inward plasma\ninjection. After inspecting the observations at r \u0001 8 Re in\nthe middle of the dipole-like plasma sheet, it can be\nconcluded that there is no strong activity (strong flux\ntransport, or pressure variations) that precedes and could\nexplain the intense plasma sheet convection (Ey) com-\nmenced at P1 location at the substorm onset. The distance\nbetween two spacecraft is too small (less than 4 Re) to allow\nfor significant flux or plasma transport to be missed in\nobservations.\n[15] The timing of important features is summarized in\nTable 1. Together with already discussed observations we\ninclude the injection of energetic electrons to 6.6 Re. This\ninjection time was obtained after eliminating the drift time\nby using the dispersed electron hole (see data in Figure 2,\nbottom) which is known to be the \u2018\u2018negative\u2019\u2019 image of\nthe ordinary energy-dispersed injected particle signatures\n[Sergeev et al., 1992]. It is observed only in the first event,\nand shows a large (\u000170 sec) time delay against the injection\nat P2, consistent with a slow inward propagation speed of\n\u000180 km\/s. We also include the earliest timing of Pi2 onset\nat subauroral stations of SAMNET network which are\ndelayed by 50\u201360 s after the initial activation observed at\nP1 spacecraft. In any case, the phenomena observed at P1\nare the most intense and earliest observations related to the\nexplosive substorm onset, and they are most closely linked\nto the basic instability responsible for the onset.\n3. Discussion\n3.1. Expansion Onset Process as Seen by the Observer\nat the Lobe\u2013Plasma Sheet Interface\n[16] Favorable location and distinct isolated onset fea-\ntures in the considered events allow us to provide a\nconsistent description of the substorm expansion process\nfrom the viewpoint of the observer, located at the lobe\u2013\nplasma sheet interface, in the transition region separating\nthe dipolelike and taillike plasma sheet domains. This\nlocation is illustrated by the P1 probe location in the\nmagnetic configuration shown in Figure 1. We note that\nactual depression of the Bz component just prior to the onset\nwas \u000110 nT larger than in the Kp = 3 T89 model used to\ndraw the field lines in Figure 1, so the real configuration is\neven more tail-like than shown.\n[17] An important new observation is that the earliest\nsignature of the onset includes a distinct increase of the\ndawn-dusk Ey field, indicative of a sudden start of intense (a\nfew mV\/m) flux transport. Although double-probe measure-\nments in the rarified lobe plasma are usually considered\nwith great caution, in our case we were able to confirm the\nlarge amplitude and time variations of Ey by directly\nobserving the energy of perpendicular (E \u0006 B\u2013related)\nproton drift motion on the ion spectrograms. We emphasize\nthat Ey and related Vz are an order more intense as compared\nto the average cross-tail electric field (about 0.15 mV\/m), so\nthat these Ey are really strong and corresponding Vz are very\nfast, compared to their average values. The reliable obser-\nvation of a convection of such intensity allows us to\ncombine and interpret a few other features observed nearly\nsimultaneously. Most of the features discussed below have\nalready been identified in previous studies, although in our\ncase the reliable Ey diagnostics, high time resolution and\ngood identical instrumentation of THEMIS spacecraft allow\nfor the first time to combine all of these features together, to\nprovide the constraints for the choice of a physical model of\nsubstorm onset.\n[18] A remarkable onset-related phenomenon is the rapid\nexit of the probe from the plasma sheet, which may be\ninterpreted either as a manifestation of fast plasma sheet\nthinning, or as a result of a current sheet tilt, induced, for\nexample, by a sudden change in the solar wind direction.\nIndeed, a short positive excursion of the solar wind Vz,\nwhich could cause the upward shift of the current sheet, was\ninferred near 2130 UT at the subsolar bow shock position\n(Figure 2). However, this feature is too late in the first event,\nand no comparable variation is seen in the second event.\nBoth events showed an increase of Ey and correspond to\nrather strong (50 to 150 km\/s) upward transport velocities\n(Vz = \u0004Ey\/Bx in Figure 4) which continued for about\n10 min, much longer than a short positive excursion of\nthe solar wind Vz in the first event. Another reason to\nbelieve in the inner-magnetospheric origin of the fast\nplasma thinning is that the onset of upward flow (Vz) was\nsynchronized within 10 s with a sudden drop of the total\npressure and with a start of Bz increase, which is inconsis-\ntent with what is expected from a simple upward lifting of\nthe current sheet. These three phenomena are closely\nconnected and should be interpreted together.\n[19] The fast plasma sheet thinning is a well-known\nmanifestation of the substorm onset; however, previously\nit was associated with a more tailward midtail region, at r >\n15 Re [Hones et al., 1984]. Previous analysis showed that\nthe thinning sheet boundary velocity evaluated from the\ntiming at two spacecraft (ISEE-1,2) was consistent with\nsimultaneously observed inward (upward in our case) plas-\nma flow velocity [Forbes et al., 1981]. A recent timing\nstudy by Cluster [Dewhurst et al., 2004] gave the typical\nthinning speeds of 10\u201370 km\/s and confirm that fast\nthinnings are the expansion-related (rather than growth\nphase-related) phenomena. In a few cases the fast thinnings\nwere observed as close to the Earth as 9 Re (Polar\nobservations at 2107 UT on 8 September 2002 presented\nby Sergeev et al. [2005]) or even \u00017 Re (initial thinning at\nTC2 before the subsequent plasma sheet expansion occurred\n1 min later [Sergeev et al., 2008]). These observations\nconflict with the scheme in which the plasma sheet is\nexpanding in the near-Earth region where dipolarization is\nobserved [McPherron et al., 1973; Baker et al., 1996]. We\nreiterate that in our case the plasma sheet thinnings were\nobserved simultaneously with the continued depolarization\n(see Figure 4).\n[20] Dipolarization (Bz increase) is very pronounced in\nboth events. Its amplitude (of the order of 10 nT) is similar\nat both P1 and P2 spacecraft and it is comparable to the\nA00C02 SERGEEV ET AL.: THEMIS OBSERVATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSETS\n7 of 11\nA00C02\npositive H component bay amplitude at the midlatitudes\n(see Figure 2). Formally this can be interpreted by the\ndecrease of the tail current that started and continued\ntailward from the P1 spacecraft, in agreement with the\nobserved dipolarization time delay from P1 to P2.\n[21] A sudden drop of the total pressure (in the absence of\nrelated drops of the solar wind flow pressure) is another\nsignificant and well-known feature of the substorm onset\nmechanism [e.g., Caan et al., 1978; Yamaguchi et al.,\n2004]. It means a net loss of the magnetic flux from the\ngiven tail cross section, which is consistent with enhanced\nflux transfer revealed by the large Ey amplitude. In other\nway, it is consistent with the decrease (disruption) of the tail\ncurrent, which takes place tailward of P1 as argued above.\n[22] All of these features can in principle be interpreted\nby either (any kind of) current disruption process in the\ninner magnetosphere (earthward of 10 Re), or by (any kind\nof) current disruption in the further tail region including the\nmagnetic reconnection. However, current disruption in the\ninner magnetosphere is inconsistent with both relative\ntiming and relative intensities of the flux transport at P1\nand P2, which stay nearly in the same magnetic meridian\nplane (within 1\u20132 Re perpendicular to that plane). Our\nstudy clearly shows that in the outermost part of the dipole-\nlike region, at r \u0001 7\u20138 Re, there were no indications of any\nsignificant phenomena, which could cause the sudden fast\ninward transport of the plasma tubes at P1\u2019s location by\nlaunching the tailward-propagating rarefaction wave propa-\ngating down the tail, as suggested in some versions of the\nInside-Out scenario [Lui, 1996]. Neither large transport\nthrough the inner region, nor the significant pressure drop\ncapable to launch the rarefaction wave are observed by the\ninner spacecraft. Vice versa, significant dipolarization\/in-\njection phenomena at P2 start later and are less intense than\nthose observed at P1. Finally, the P1 and P2 probes are close\nenough (interspacecraft distance is less than 4 Re) to safely\nexclude the possibility, that the strong process capable of\nconsiderably changing the amount of magnetic flux or\nplasma in the very limited space between the two closely\nspaced spacecraft could be missed from observations.\n[23] \u2018\u2018Dipolarization\u2019\u2019 combined with \u2018\u2018thinning\u2019\u2019 is a\nnontrivial combination. For geometrical reasons, a dipolar-\nized tube normally has a larger height\/thickness compared\nto its \u2018\u2018stretched\u2019\u2019 neighbors. The inward propagation of a\nfast plasma flow tube, the likely result of a tailward source\nlocation (either reconnection or current disruption), or its\nbraking; both processes are typically associated with the\nincrease of the plasma sheet thickness (e.g., the simulation\nof plasma bubbles by Birn et al. [2004]). If the enhanced\nmagnetic field diffusion occurs at the distance probed by the\nP1 spacecraft, it is usually associated with the increase of\nthe current sheet thickness. Therefore the combination\n\u2018\u2018dipolarization+plasma sheet thinning\u2019\u2019 may be an addi-\ntional important property to constrain the choice of sub-\nstorm onset mechanism.\n[24] The magnetic reconnection process provides the total\npressure drop (unloading) and includes the inward plasma\nand flux transport (toward and through the reconnection\nseparatrix) and dipolarization (see, e.g., Baker et al. [1996]\nfor a review). The outward expansion of accelerated plasma\n(plasma sheet expansion) which proceeds simultaneously\nwith the plasma motion in the opposite direction (toward the\nneutral sheet) is also explained by the reconnection model in\ncase of lobe reconnection. However, the association of\nplasma sheet thinning and dipolarization does not automat-\nically follow from the reconnection mechanism taken alone,\nwithout being implanted into the realistic magnetospheric\nconfiguration. In the next section we shall address this\nquestion by using the global 3d MHD simulations.\n3.2. Interpretation of Fast Plasma Sheet Thinning\nPhase\n[25] In this section we shall demonstrate the results of\nglobal MHD simulations of the reconnection onset in the\ntail current sheet to show that two phenomena, namely,\ndipolarization and plasma sheet thinning, may be observed\nsimultaneously in the transition region during a sudden\nincrease of the reconnection rate for a nearby active X line,\nstaying a few Re from the observation point. For this\npurpose we utilize one of simulations made previously in\nCommunity Coordinated Modelling Center at NASA\/GSFC\n(run Masha_Kuznetsova_092203_6a). In that case the\nBATSRUS code [Powell et al., 1999] was run with a very\nhigh spatial grid resolution of 1\/16 Re in the tail current\nsheet region of interest.\n[26] Figure 6 (right) provides the simulation results at\n1-min time resolution near the reconnection onset time at\nX = \u000410 Re for two locations (at Z = 1 and 1.5 Re) in\nthe same format as THEMIS observations shown in Figure 6\n(left). Selected snapshots of the plasma configuration are\ncollected in Figure 7. The simulated disturbance was driven\nby the solar wind with a strong southward IMF (Bz = \u000410\nnT) which caused a rapid growth and thinning of the tail\ncurrent at the initial stage. This thinning was enhanced after\na reconnection X line started to develop at 0814 (of\nsimulation time, ST) near X \u0001 \u000415 Re, which occurred\ninside of the closed field lines, in the thin current sheet\nformed during the previous several minutes.\n[27] Soon after this time Ey, Bz and plasma inflow (\u0004Vz,\ntaking into account the probe locations in the northern half\nof the simulated plasma sheet) start to grow gradually,\nwhich is noticeable after 0817 ST. This occurs concurrently\nwith the enhanced plasma sheet thinning, as evident from\nFigure 6 (bottom). This episode is what we would like to\nhighlight in the simulations to argue where and when the\nreconnection can naturally provide the complementary\ndipolarization and thinning, namely, on the Earthward side\nof the near-Earth reconnection region while the reconnec-\ntion still proceeds inside the closed flux tubes. The thinning\ncontinued at an enhanced rate until 0823 ST, when the lobe\nreconnection started and plasmoid was quickly expelled\nfrom the midtail allowing for the increased reconnection\nrate. The rapid magnetic flux pileup in the near-Earth tail at\nthis stage caused the fast expansion of the strongly heated\nplasma sheet, which proceeded for a few minutes while the\nplasma kept the same Vz (directed toward the neutral sheet).\n[28] There cannot be a complete analogy between the\nsimulation results and observations. The amplitudes and\ntime scales are somewhat different. The initial plasma sheet\ntemperature is very different. Such differences are not\nsurprising when taking into account the absence of correct\nmicrophysics in the MHD simulation model. Although there\nis no direct analogy between the modest external driving in\nour THEMIS event and the strong driving in the simulated\nA00C02 SERGEEV ET AL.: THEMIS OBSERVATIONS AT SUBSTORM ONSETS\n8 of 11\nA00C02\nevent, this simulation shows that it is principally possible to\nobserve in the transition region (near 10 Re in case of\nsimulations) a combination of thinning and dipolarization as\na result of the development of the magnetic reconnection at\na nearby (a few Re) location from the observation point.\n[29] In the context of these simulations we can interpret\nour observations as follows. The sudden drop in the total\npressure, increase of Ey, Bz and Vz can be attributed to the\nexplosive growth of reconnection in closed flux tubes at the\ndistance of a few Re from probe P1. Similar large ampli-\ntudes of impulsive reconnection on closed field lines\nwere previously shown to occur [Sergeev et al., 2008].\nThe following stage, during which the probe P1 exited into\nthe lobe during a strong plasma inflow (large + Vz) in the\nabsence of any energization of the outer plasma sheet may\ncorrespond to the episode of reconnection proceeding\non closed field lines. We note that at a speed of Vz \u0001\n50\u2013100 km\/s (i.e., 0.5\u20131 Re\/min) observed at P1 in the first\nevent, the entire closed magnetic flux contained in the\nplasma sheet at r 11 Re should be transported to the neutral\nsheet, reconnected and transported away (because the total\npressure continues to decrease) in a couple of minutes. The\nlast stage, with the sudden expansion of the heated plasma\nsheet, is natural to associate with lobe reconnection.\n[30] The final verification of this scenario will certainly\nrequire the direct observations of the reconnection at the\nmore tailward THEMIS spacecraft, which we hope will be\navailable after analyses of other events during the THEMIS\nmission.\n4. Conclusions\n[31] Simultaneous measurements during distinct substorm\nonsets near the midnight meridian made by two THEMIS\nprobes, one in the inner region at 7\u20138 Re, and another one\nnear the plasma sheet\u2013lobe interface at 11\u201312 Re, show the\nearliest indication of the explosive onset and the largest flux\ntransport rates to occur at the outermost spacecraft, con-\nfirming that the source region was definitely at r > 11 Re in\nthe midtail in these events. As seen by the observer near the\nplasma sheet boundary, the explosive process responsible\nfor substorm onset is characterized by the fast unloading of\nthe magnetic energy and fast transport of plasma tubes\ntoward the neutral sheet leading to the fast plasma sheet\nthinning under the conditions of frozen-in plasma. This all\noccurred simultaneously with the local magnetic dipolariza-\ntion (Bz increase), which is a nontrivial association because\nin most cases the dipolarized tubes have a larger thickness\nthan their thin neighbors have. Only \u00016\u20138 min later, the\nplasma sheet expanded while the plasma tubes continued to\nmove inward; the expanding plasma was considerably\nheated up to the boundary, and its density was reduced as\ncompared to the preonset state. The process operated with\nfast transfer rates characterized by Ey up to 5 mV\/m in the\nFigure 6.
