Introduction\n[2] Since the auroral substorm concept was first intro-\nduced from the ground-based auroral observations [Akasofu,\n1964], many mechanisms for the magnetospheric substorm\nhave been proposed. One of the most challenging subjects\nof substorm research is the onset process of substorm\nexpansion, which is the beginning of the violent release of\nenergy into the ionosphere that is stored in the magneto-\nsphere. There are currently two major scenarios for the\ntriggering of a substorm: the near-Earth neutral line (NENL)\nmodel [e.g., Baker et al., 1996; Shiokawa et al., 1998]\nwhich proposes that magnetic reconnection in the mid-tail\ninitiates substorm onset, and the current disruption (CD)\nmodel [e.g., Lui et al., 1992; Lyons, 1995] which proposes\nthat cross-tail\u2013current disruption in the near-Earth tail\nregion triggers substorm onset.\n[3] In both scenarios, abrupt particle acceleration along\nauroral field lines is essential to complete the substorm\nonset process. A sudden formation of a parallel electric field\nin the magnetosphere-ionosphere (M-I) coupling system is\nrequired. However, neither scenarios necessarily contain a\nself-consistent field-aligned acceleration process; instead, it\nis a consequence of the process. In these substorm onset\narguments, a question arises: Can the ionosphere at any time\naccept the onset demand from the magnetosphere and\ninstantly build up a parallel electric field in the M-I coupling\nregion? There might be cases in which the ionosphere is not\nready for a substorm, not ready to establish a substorm\ncurrent closure between the magnetosphere and ionosphere\nand field-aligned acceleration. To answer this question, we\nneed detailed observations of the dynamical behavior (ver-\ntical development) of the field-aligned acceleration region\naround substorm onset times as well as information on the\nlatitudinal and longitudinal expansion of the auroral arcs\n(horizontal development).\nJOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, VOL. 113, A09213, doi:10.1029\/2008JA013322, 2008\nClick\nHere\nfor\nFull\nArticle\n1Planetary Plasma and Atmospheric Research Center, Tohoku\nUniversity, Sendai, Japan.\n2Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory, Nagoya University, Nagoya,\nJapan.\n3Space Environment Research Center, Kyushu University, Fukuoka,\nJapan.\n4Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley,\nCalifornia, USA.\n5Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa, Iowa City,\nIowa, USA.\n6Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Calgary,\nAlberta, Canada.\n7Department of Communication Systems, Lancaster University,\nLancaster, UK.\nCopyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.\n0148-0227\/08\/2008JA013322$09.00\nA09213 1 of 14\n[4] The existence of auroral particle acceleration parallel\nto the ambient magnetic field in the upward field-aligned\ncurrent (FAC) region has been established by sounding\nrocket observations [e.g., Evans, 1974; Arnoldy et al.,\n1974] and satellite observations [e.g., Shelley et al., 1976;\nMizera and Fennell, 1977]. Direct evidence of parallel\nelectric fields in the auroral acceleration region was first\nreported by Mozer et al. [1977]. These observations were\nconsistent with the inverted-V particle precipitation [Frank\nand Ackerson, 1971] associated with the auroral arcs.\nRecent in-situ observations from the Polar and Fast Auroral\nSnapshot (FAST) satellites revealed detailed characteristics\nof field-aligned electric fields together with accelerated\nparticle spectra and background plasma distributions there-\nin. These observations suggest that parallel electric fields\nare located at two altitudes (high-altitude E\/\/ and low-\naltitude E\/\/) from about 0.5 to 2 RE [Ergun et al., 2002].\nThese in-situ observations have greatly contributed to the\nunderstanding of the comprehensive behavior of quasi-\nsteady auroral particle acceleration in the M-I coupling\nregion.\n[5] The important issues still to be addressed after these\nobservations are as follows: (1) How does the field-aligned\nacceleration evolve prior to and at substorm onsets and\nduring substorm expansion phases? (2) What is the connec-\ntion between substorm triggering in the magnetosphere and\nthe abrupt build up of the auroral particle acceleration in the\nionosphere? These questions require knowledge about the\ntime-dependent vertical evolution of the acceleration region\nat substorm onsets.\n[6] AKR remote senses field-aligned acceleration region\nat substorms because AKR is initiated by the accelerated\nelectrons in the M-I coupling region. Kaiser and Alexander\n[1977] first discussed the substorm evolution and related\nAKR source dynamics using the AKR spectrograms. Sub-\nsequently many studies [e.g.,Morioka et al., 1981; Liou et al.,\n2000; de Feraudy et al., 2001; Hanasz et al., 2001] have\naddressed the acceleration altitude in the auroral region on\nthe basis of the AKR spectra. Olsson et al. [2004] and\nJanhunen et al. [2004] suggested Alfve\u00b4n waves can accel-\nerate auroral particles on the basis of the AKR spectral\ncharacteristics.\n[7] Morioka et al. [2007] recently derived information on\nthe dynamical behavior of the field-aligned acceleration\nduring substorms using high-time-resolution spectrograms.\nThey assumed that AKR is radiated at the local electron\ncyclotron frequency in the parallel electric field region and\nthat the frequency-band reflected the source altitude along\nthe auroral field line. They then investigated the evolution\nof the auroral acceleration region from the AKR spectral\nbehavior and obtained information on the vertical structure\nof the acceleration region and its dynamic behavior prior to\nand during a substorm. Dual acceleration regions at sub-\nstorm onset were identified: a low-altitude one and a high-\naltitude one. The low-altitude acceleration region appeared\nduring the substorm growth phase at 4000 to 5000 km,\nwhile the high-altitude one appeared abruptly with the\nsubstorm onset at 6000 to 12,000 km.\n[8] The high-altitude AKR has been studied in terms of\n\u2018\u2018isolated AKR\u2019\u2019 (ITKR [Steinberg et al., 1988, 1990]),\n\u2018\u2018different types of AKR\u2019\u2019 (LF burst [Kaiser et al., 1996;\nDesch and Farrell, 2000]) \u2018\u2018dot-AKR\u2019\u2019 [de Feraudy et al.,\n2001], and \u2018\u2018LF-AKR\u2019\u2019 [Olsson et al., 2004; Janhunen et al.,\n2004]. It has generally been agreed that the low-frequency\ncomponent of AKR is accompanied by substorm onset\nalmost without exception [e.g., Anderson et al., 1997,\n1998].\n[9] The progress of these observations now enables us to\nstudy the connection between the auroral acceleration\nprocess and magnetospheric substorm onsets. In this paper,\nwe investigate the detailed dynamics of the M-I coupling\nregion in relation to the substorm onset and discuss how the\nauroral acceleration region evolves in relation to magneto-\nspheric substorms.\n2. Database Used\n[10] The Polar satellite is in a highly elliptical polar orbit\nwith an apogee at about 9 RE, and it collects data from a\nhigh-altitude perspective on auroral activities. We used the\nAKR data provided from Plasma Wave Investigation (PWI)\n[Gurnett et al., 1995] observations onboard the Polar\nsatellite. PWI provides high-time-resolution spectral data\nfor the electric field every 2.352 seconds, which enables us\nto investigate the fine evolution of the AKR source along\nthe auroral field lines.\n[11] Polar Ultra Violet Imager (UVI) data [Torr et al.,\n1995] were also used to examine the synoptic auroral\nactivity during substorms. All-sky imager data at Gillam\n(from the NORSTAR database) were referred in identifying\nthe local breakup of auroral substorms. Geomagnetic pul-\nsation data from auroral (from WDC in NIPR), sub-auroral\n(from the SAMNET and CAMNOS databases), and low-\nlatitude (from WDC in Kyoto University) stations were\nused to identify substorm onset by Pi 2 pulsation. The\nlocation and related geomagnetic information on these\nground stations are listed in Table 1.\n3. Observations\n3.1. AKR Breakup and Substorm\n[12] Since AKR is generated at the local electron cyclo-\ntron frequency, fc, by beamed electrons in the auroral\nacceleration region [e.g., Ergun et al., 1998; Delory et al.,\n1998; Pottelette et al., 2001], the altitude range of the AKR\nsource can be estimated from its frequency-band. Thus the\nf-t diagram of AKR can be converted into an altitude-time\n(a-t) diagram of the AKR source [Morioka et al., 2007].\nFigure 1a shows the a\u2013 t diagram of AKR sources converted\nfrom the f-t diagram observed by PWI on 30 January 1997.\nThe auroral field line of the AKR emission was assumed to\nbe at L = 7 (Invariant latitude (ILAT) = 67.7\u0001). Since fc is not\nsensitive to the invariant latitude in the polar region, the\nestimated AKR altitude is valid even when the auroral field\nline is not exactly L = 7. The right ordinate of Figure 1a\nshows the observed frequency for reference. The AKR\nintensity is represented by the false color code in logarithm\nof AKR power. The periodic structures at around 15,000 and\n13,000 km (corresponding to about 40 and 60 kHz, respec-\ntively) here and in all of the a-t diagrams shown hereafter\nare instrumental artifacts. Figure 1d presents ULF data at the\nmidlatitude station (Victoria; L = 2.9) in the midnight sector.\nThe two Pi 2 pulsations starting around 08:08 and 08:42 UT\nindicate substorm onsets in the magnetosphere [e.g., Saito\nA09213 MORIOKA ET AL.: AKR BREAKUP AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION\n2 of 14\nA09213\net al., 1976]. From Figures 1a and 1d, we can derive the\nAKR source dynamics during the substorm. Low-altitude\nAKR appeared around 08:00 UT at altitudes from 3000 to\n6000 km. Almost simultaneously with the first Pi 2 onset\nat around 08:08 UT, the AKR source region suddenly\nexpanded to a higher altitude. The colored\/contoured a-t\ndiagram indicates that this source expansion was not a\nsimple development from the preexisting low-altitude\nTable 1.

The altitude of the new high-altitude source\nranged from 7000 to 14,000 km. This is the dual structure\nof the acceleration regions at substorm onset reported by\nMorioka et al. [2007]. By the time of the second substorm\nonset at \u000208:42, the high-altitude AKR had weakened and\nthe low-altitude AKR had decayed into a narrow source at\nan altitude \u00025000 km. Near the second substorm onset,\nthe AKR source region was again activated. Immediately\nbefore the second Pi 2 onset (about 1 min before), the\nlow-altitude AKR intensity increased, and an intense high-\naltitude AKR appeared over a wide altitude range (6500\u2013\n16,000 km).\n[13] Figures 1b and 1c represent the power profiles of the\nAKR intensity at high altitudes (7000\u20139000 km) and low\naltitudes (4000\u20135000 km), respectively. It is evident from\nthese figures that the high-altitude AKR intensity grew explo-\nsively, almost four orders of magnitude within 30 seconds at\nthe 08:08 UT onset and within 1 minute at the 08:42 UT\nonset. Other cases of fast evolutions of the high-altitude\nsources at substorm onsets were reported by Morioka et al.\n[2007] (see Figure 6 of their paper). The low-altitude AKR\n(Figure 1c), on the other hand, grew rather slowly and\nshowed small variations in intensity.\n[14] These features of AKR during substorms are com-\nmonly observed: a low-altitude AKR source appears prior to\nand during the substorm over a rather narrow altitude range\n(4000 to 6000 km in altitude), while a high-altitude AKR\nsource suddenly appears with intense power at the substorm\nonset along a wider altitude range (6000 to 12,000 km in\naltitude) above the preexisting low-altitude AKR source.\nFigure 2 illustrates how often and how similarly Pi 2\nassociated (substorm associated) AKR is observed. The\nfigure shows a-t diagrams of AKR from the Polar satellite\nand simultaneous ULF data from Kakioka (L = 1.3). These\nsix examples are typical ones found from the data set in the\n20\u201303 h magnetic local time (MLT) at Kakioka during the\nfirst 2 weeks in January 1997. All of them demonstrate that\nhigh-altitude AKR suddenly appears above preexisting low-\naltitude AKR at substorm onsets. Morioka et al. [2007]\nindicated that 69% of the associations between AKR and\nlow latitude Pi 2 showed the sudden appearance of a new\nhigh-altitude AKR source at substorm onsets.\n[15] Here we propose a term \u2018\u2018AKR breakup\u2019\u2019 to describe\nthe abrupt development of the field-aligned acceleration\nregion in the M-I coupling region at substorm onsets.\n3.2. AKR Breakup and Auroral Breakup\n[16] The relationship between AKR breakup and local\nauroral breakup is shown in Figure 3. The lower panel\nshows the a-t diagram for 15 min on 11 May 1996. Weak\nlow-altitude AKR was observed between 5000 and 7000 km\nwhich gradually decreased. The intensity of the low-altitude\nAKR increased at \u000204:34 UT, and intensified again around\n04:37 UT after a modest intensity gap. About 2 minutes\nafter the start of the second gradual increase, high-altitude\nAKR suddenly appeared and completed its growth within\nFigure 3.

Lower panel: a-t diagram of AKR indicating AKR breakup at 04:39 UT after gradual\nenhancement of low-altitude AKR.\nA09213 MORIOKA ET AL.: AKR BREAKUP AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION\n5 of 14\nA09213\nabout 30 seconds at altitudes of 8000\u201312,000 km with peak\nintensity at 9000 km. This abrupt buildup of the dual\nsources at 04:39 UT is the AKR breakup. It is again\ndemonstrated that the high-altitude AKR is not an extension\nfrom low-altitude AKR but is a newly created source. The\nupper panel of Figure 3 shows all-sky images from Gillam\n(L = 6.5). A stable auroral arc was observed slightly south of\nthe zenith until 04:35 UT. At 04:37 UT (image c), both the arc\nbrightness and latitudinal extent increased, corresponding to\nthe second intensification of the low-altitude AKR. The\nauroral arc broke up at 04:39 UT (image d) showing sudden\narc intensification and poleward expansion. This observation\nconfirms that AKR breakups coincide with local auroral\nbreakups at auroral latitudes.\n[17] Figure 4 shows the relationship between AKR source\nevolutions and global auroral activities seen from the Polar\nsatellite. The lower panel is the a-t diagram on 3 April 1996.\nLow-altitude AKR appeared at \u000215:32 UT in the altitude\nrange 3000\u20135000 km, and began intensification at\n\u000215:35 UT. Between 15:35 and 15:36 UT, AKR breakup\ntook place showing a formation of a new high-altitude\nsource with the growth time of about 30 seconds. The new\nhigh-altitude AKR extended up to 8500 km with peak\nintensity at \u00027000 km. After this AKR breakup, several\nAKR breakups recurred (\u000215:38 and \u000215:42 UT) at high\naltitudes, while the low-altitude AKRwas relatively inactive.\nThe upper panel of Figure 4 shows a sequence of nightside\n(1800\u20130600 MLT) auroral UVI images. The 7 images in the\npanel are all that were available during this period (15:31 to\n15:37 UT). The images were obtained by a combination of\nLBHL and LBHL filters in the wavelength range 140\u2013180\nnm. The narrow blue horizontal bar under each panel\nindicates the exposure time. The faint oval around 65\u2013\n67\u0001magnetic latitude in the premidnight sector (image a)\ngradually became brighter and its latitudinal extent widened\n(image b), roughly coincident with the appearance of the\nlow-altitude AKR. It became more distinct and clearer and\ncontinued to grow (images c and d). The image at 15:35:48\n(image e) corresponds to an auroral breakup or immediately\nafter a breakup as shown by the intense brightening at the\ncenter of the active region and the poleward expansion of\nthe poleward boundary. This auroral breakup (or the mo-\nment immediately after the breakup) was almost simulta-\nneous with the AKR breakup. This confirms that auroral\nbreakup is the time when the local ionosphere in the center\nof the active region connects to the magnetosphere through\na suddenly formed parallel acceleration region.\n[18] It should be also noted that, before the auroral\nbreakup, the gradual intensification of the auroral arc\/oval\nstarted almost concurrently with the appearance of low-\naltitude AKR (15:32 UT). This tight relationship between\nthe pre-breakup auroral activity and the low-altitude accel-\neration region suggests that the low-altitude AKR is not\ndirectly related to the local breakup but is related to the\nglobal intensification of the aurora in the auroral oval.\n3.3. Evolution of Acceleration Region and\nField-Aligned Current Around Substorm Onset\n[19] To elucidate the formation process of the auroral\nacceleration region at substorm onsets, we further examined\nFigure 4.

They illustrate the Polar\nobservations for the development of an auroral oval and\nAKR. At around 01:04 UT on 17 May 1996, the AKR broke\nup almost simultaneously with the auroral breakup. In the\nUV image at 01:03:53 UT (image e), a bright spot appeared\nat the center of the active region on the premidnight oval. It\nis again seen that, before the AKR breakup, weak low-\naltitude AKR appeared, and its gradual growth was fol-\nlowed by the pre-breakup evolution of the auroral oval. The\nlast three panels plot the ULF data at the midlatitude station\n(Nordli; L = 4.1) in the northern hemisphere, and geomag-\nnetically conjugate-pair stations at auroral latitudes (Tjornes\n(L = 6.4) in Iceland and Syowa (L = 6.0) in Antarctica). The\nlocal times of these stations during the auroral breakup were\ndusk (Nordli) and post midnight (Tjornes and Syowa)\nFigure 5. Substorm event on 17 May 1996.

The Nordli ULF data showed\ntypical Pi 2 pulsation at \u000201:04 UT, almost coincident with\nboth auroral and AKR breakups. Low-latitude and midlat-\nitude Pi 2 pulsations are manifestation of magnetospheric\nsubstorm onsets [Yumoto et al., 1994; Olson, 1999; Kepko\net al., 2004] accurate to \u00021.5 min on average [Liou et al.,\n1999; Meng and Liou, 2004]. Considering the simulta-\nneous onset of midlatitude Pi 2 with the AKR breakup and\nauroral breakup, we deduce the substorm onset time to be\n01:03:30\u201301:04:00 UT (indicated by the vertical rectangle\nin Figure 5).\n[21] The ULF data of both auroral conjugate stations\nshowed long-period magnetic field oscillation began at\n\u000201:00 UT, about 3.5 minutes before the substorm onset\nAt substorm onset, a new irregular oscillation, the start of\nwhich was almost synchronized with the midlatitude Pi 2\npulsation observed at Nordli, was superposed on the preex-\nisting longer period oscillations. Note that the fundamental\ncomponents of both pre- and post-onset oscillations were\nbasically in phase between the two conjugate-pair stations\nand midlatitude station, indicating that they were not locally\ngenerated irregular oscillations in the ionosphere but odd\nmode waves generated in the magnetosphere. These fine\nphase relationships were observed when the stations were\nnot under the substorm onset-site where the violent iono-\nspheric electrojet was dominant, like the case shown in\nimage f. It is also noteworthy to note that the start of the\nlong-period waves before the onset was closely associated\nwith the gradual intensification of the low-altitude AKR.\nThis suggests that some magnetospheric disturbances were\nactivated prior to the substorm onset, resulting in the MHD\nwave generation in the magnetosphere and intensification of\nthe field-aligned acceleration (low-altitude AKR) in the M-I\ncoupling region.\n3.3.2. 16 April 1996 Event\n[22] Figure 6 illustrates the detailed evolution of AKR\nand ground-based ULF pulsations. Figure 6a shows the a-t\ndiagram of AKR for 15 minutes on 16 April 1996. AKR\nbreakup occurred \u000223:13 UT preceded by the gradual\nenhancement of low-altitude AKR from about 23:10 UT.\nThe magnetogram at Kvistberg (L = 3.3) is shown in\nFigure 6b, where midlatitude Pi 2 pulsation began around\n23:13 UT. From these two remote observations of the substorm,\nwe can say the onset time of the substorm was 23:12:40\u2013\n23:13:10 UT (indicated by the vertical rectangle in the figure).\n[23] Figure 6c shows the ULF (dH\/dt) data at Tjornes.\nThe irregular pulsations that started around 23:11 UT are the\nhigh-latitude Pi 2 pulsations [e.g., Olson, 1999]. Around\nthis time, Tjornes was at premidnight location (midnight in\nmagnetic local time (MLT) is 23:45 UT at Tjornes). It is\ninteresting that dH\/dt data showed quasi-DC variation\ntoward negative values with alternative oscillations. The\nsimultaneous negative excursion of the dH\/dt signal was\nalso observed at the conjugate station, Syowa (not shown).\nTo investigate the characteristics of this geomagnetic fluc-\ntuation, we analyzed ULF signals in terms of the band-pass\nampligram. Figures 6d\u20136m show the band-pass compo-\nnents of dH\/dt signal at Tjornes divided into ten period\nbands in the period range 2 to 100 seconds. Three ULF\ncomponents related to the substorm onset are evident from\nthis band-pass ampligram.\n[24] Quasi-DC component: The dH\/dt signal began to\nnegatively decrease (quasi-DC variation) about 2 minutes\nbefore the substorm onset, roughly simultaneous with the\ngradual enhancement of low-altitude AKR. This is obvious\nfrom both the raw dH\/dt data and from band-10 (Figure 6m),\nwhere a gradual decrease of the field began around 23:11 UT.\nThis negative excursion of the derivative of the geomagnetic\nH-component (d\/d\/t (dH\/dt) < 0) suggests an exponential\nincrease in the westward electrojet current in the ionosphere,\ninduced by the exponential increase in the upward FAC. It\nshould be also noted that the decrease in the quasi-DC\ncomponent just before the onset seen in band-10 was again\naccelerated around the substorm onset, indicating the explo-\nsive reinforcement of FAC at the onset. This reinforced FAC\nwould correspond to the upward current part of the sub-\nstorm current wedge (SCW) system [e.g., Akasofu, 1972;\nMcPherron et al., 1973; Lui, 1996].\n[25] Shorter period component: Short period components\n(less than 30 seconds) showed irregular variations, as seen\nin Figures 6d to 6f. The amplitudes of these fluctuations\ngradually increased starting almost simultaneously with the\nappearance of the quasi-DC component (blue areas in band-1\nand -2). These fluctuations are interpreted as the noise\ncomponent of the exponentially increasing FAC. Note that\nthe amplitudes of this noise suddenly increased after the\nsubstorm onset (beige area in band-1 and -2). This is\nconsistent with the signature of the tail-current disruption\nwith violent fluctuations and\/or fluctuations associated with\nthe ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator [e.g., Lysak, 1991].\n[26] MHD wave component: Two kinds of MHD waves\nrelated to substorm onset were observed. They seem to be\nexcited in the magnetosphere because they showed in-phase\noscillation between the conjugate stations (not shown). In\nthe period range between 30 and 50 seconds (band-4 and -5),\nsmall-amplitude but continuous waves appeared around\n23:11 UT (blue areas in band-4 and -5) nearly simultaneous\nwith the appearance of the negative quasi-DC component\n(Figure 6c). The excitation of these waves prior to the\nsubstorm onset would be closely related to the gradual\nenhancement of the FAC driven in the near-Earth magne-\ntosphere. At substorm onset, the wave amplitude was\nsuddenly enhanced, and then showed damping after the\nonset (beige areas in band-4 and -5). Another wave com-\nponent related to the substorm is the longer period pulsation\nwith a large amplitude, as seen in band-7 to band-10 (note\nthat the vertical axis for these components is twice that for\ncomponents with shorter bands). This longer period oscil-\nlation was excited about 1 minute after the onset (beige\nareas in band-7 to -10) and consisted of a small number of\nwave trains.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. Summary of Observations\n[27] Dual structure of auroral acceleration regions: Two\nsources of AKR were identified at substorm onsets from\nfrequency spectrograms observed by Polar\/PWI. One source\nis a low-altitude source corresponding to middle-frequency\n(MF) AKR, and the other is a high-altitude source\ncorresponding to low-frequency (LF) AKR. The former\nappears in the substorm growth phase at altitudes from\n4000 to 5000 km and intensifies a few minutes prior to the\nA09213 MORIOKA ET AL.: AKR BREAKUP AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION\n9 of 14\nA09213\nsubstorm onset. In contrast, the high-altitude AKR appears\nabruptly with intense power in a higher and wider altitude\nrange, 6000 to 12,000 km. The increase in its power is\nexplosive (increasing 10,000 times with the growth time of\n30 seconds), suggesting the abrupt growth of the parallel\nelectric fields that cause bursty auroral electron beams. The\nsource of the onset-associated high-altitude AKR is differ-\nent from that of the preexisting low-altitude AKR, showing\nthat the source is not a simple expansion from a preexisting\nAKR source but a newly developed one. This duality of\nAKR sources is a common feature of substorms. These\nfindings of the vertical structure of the M-I coupling region\nand its dynamics at substorm onsets could not be made until\nthe fine-resolution wave data from the Polar satellite,\nbecame available.\n[28] The existence of two AKR sources suggests the\nexistence of two types of field-aligned accelerations in the\nM-I coupling region during a substorm. On the basis of in-\nsitu observations by the FAST satellite, Ergun et al. [2000]\nsuggested that the parallel electric fields are concentrated in\nat least two locations: high-altitude E\/\/ near \u00021 RE and low-\naltitude E\/\/ between \u00022000 and \u00025000 km along the\nmagnetic field lines. The statistical study of the electric\nfield distribution using in-situ E-field observations by the\nPolar satellite [Mozer and Hull, 2001] showed that the\nhigh-, middle-, and low-altitude electric field regions are\nroughly at 2.5\u20133 RE, at 2\u20132.5 RE, and below \u00022 RE\ngeocentric, respectively. These in-situ observations are not\nnecessarily consistent with the present study. This may be\npartly because their analyses were essentially statistical ones\nbased on long-term observations in contrast to our remote\nand temporal observations.\n[29] AKR breakup: AKR breakup is defined in this study\nas the explosive development of a high-altitude AKR source\nat the time of an auroral breakup, which suggests the abrupt\nformation of an acceleration region above a preexisting and\nfairly stable low-altitude acceleration region. The explosive\ngrowth of the high-altitude acceleration in a very short time\nimplies a local and coherent development of acceleration.\nAuroral observations by means of recent photometers with\nhigh-time resolution have revealed the detailed development\nof auroral breakup. Friedrich et al. [2001] reported that the\nauroral expansion phase is composed of three stages and\nthat the first explosive onset takes place within tens of\nseconds before the poleward motion of 557.7-nm emissions.\nMende et al. [2007] examined one example of substorm\nusing the THEMIS ground-based observations and showed\nthat it took 27 seconds from arc brightening to auroral\nbreakup. This breakup time seems to be consistent with the\ngrowth time for the AKR breakup (\u000230 seconds).\n[30] Pre-onset activity of AKR and auroral arc: AKR\nbreakups are usually preceded within 1\u20133 minutes by the\nappearance and\/or gradual enhancement of low-altitude\nAKR, which can be seen in Figures 1 to 6. This suggests\nthat the explosive buildup of the high-altitude electric field\ntakes place in the course of the gradual growth of low-\naltitude acceleration, in other words, low-altitude accelera-\ntion is a necessary condition for the ignition of high-altitude\nbursty acceleration.\n[31] It was also shown in this study (as seen in Figures 3\nand 4) that, almost concurrently with the beginning of the\nlow-altitude AKR, the auroral arc exhibited the pre-onset\nactivity prior to the auroral and AKR breakup. This suggests\nthat the low-altitude acceleration along the auroral oval is\nresponsible for the activation of both the longitudinally\nelongated auroral arc and the low-altitude AKR before the\nonset. Recent ground-based auroral observations disclosed\nthe detailed behavior of auroral features around substorm\nonset. Friedrich et al. [2001] reported a case in which there\nwas a period of emission intensification 4 min prior to the\npoleward movement. Lyons et al. [2002] showed that the\nintensity of the breakup arc increases monotonically for\nthe few minutes prior to the substorm onset and then\nincreases explosively. These observations would correspond\nto the present pre-onset activity of the auroral arc and the\nlow-altitude AKR.\n[32] ULF around substorm onset: The ULF signals (dH\/dt)\nfrom the search-coil magnetometer at ground presented very\ninteresting behaviors prior to auroral and AKR breakup. The\nquasi-DC component of dH\/dt showed a gradual negative\nexcursion almost concurrent with the enhancement of low-\naltitude AKR before the onset. The negative excursion\nsuggests the exponentially increasing westward auroral\nelectrojet current induced by the exponentially increasing\nupward FAC. At auroral and AKR breakups, the decrease in\nthis component further accelerated indicating the sudden\nreinforcement of the FAC. This quasi-DC variation before a\nsubstorm has remained unnoticed except by Kepko et al.\n[2004], who described a high-latitude magnetic precursor to\nthe substorm onset.\n[33] In spite of the few reports of this phenomenon, we\ncan show how common these phenomena are in the night\nside auroral region. Figure 7 shows typical records of dH\/dt\ncomponent from the search-coil magnetometer for a 4-week\nperiod (16 April to 13 May 1996) at the Tjornes-Syowa\nconjugate-pair stations. The arrow above each panel shows\nthe onset of the midlatitude Pi 2 pulsation detected at the\nSAMNET stations. Many negative quasi-DC variations\nwere found prior to the onset (hatched portions in the\nfigure). The reason why these common phenomena were\nnot previously noticed is probably that most examinations\nof ULF phenomena have been done using high-pass filtered\ndata from an ordinary magnetometer.\n[34] As shown in Figure 6, the high-latitude Pi 2 can be\ndescribed in terms of both the short-period (less than\n30 seconds) irregular fluctuation and MHD waves which\nshow the in-phase oscillation between the conjugate-pair\nstations. The former is characterized by its gradual ampli-\nfication as the quasi-DC component intensifies before the\nonset and its sudden reinforcement immediately at auroral\nand AKR breakup. This component can be attributed to the\nfluctuation in the ionospheric current that connects to FAC.\nThe MHD waves are rather smooth and continuous and can\nbe classified into two components. The first component\nbelongs to Pc 3 pulsation with a period of 30\u201360 seconds.\nA remarkable characteristic of this pulsation is that it starts\nalmost simultaneously with the appearance of the quasi-DC\ncomponent of dH\/dt and low-altitude AKR prior to the\nonset. These waves may correspond to the kinetic balloon-\ning instability (KBI) in the plasma sheet during the growth\nphase, as discussed by Cheng and Zaharia [2004]. The\nother MHD waves appear immediately after substorm onset\nwith a longer period (more than 80 seconds) and are\ncharacterized by a shorter duration and 1\u20132 pulse trains.\nA09213 MORIOKA ET AL.: AKR BREAKUP AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION\n10 of 14\nA09213\n4.2. Formation of Field-Aligned Acceleration at\nAround Substorm Onset\n[35] The scenario for the formation of field-aligned ac-\nceleration at substorm onset is required to explain the\nessential evidence presented in this study: (1) separate\nacceleration regions at lower (4000\u20135000 km) and higher\n(6000\u201312,000 km) altitudes, (2) gradual intensification of\nlow-altitude acceleration prior to AKR onset, and (3) explo-\nsive growth (within 30 seconds) of a high-altitude accelera-\ntion region at onset.\n[36] The large-scale quasi-static field-aligned electric\nfield has been discussed as a self-consistently formed\nelectrostatic potential structure due to the anisotropic mag-\nnetospheric plasma distribution, such as quasi-static double\nlayers [e.g., Block, 1972; Ergun et al., 2004], electrostatic\nshocks [e.g., Swift, 1975], and the magnetic mirror process\n[e.g., Chiu and Schulz, 1978]. The low-altitude acceleration\nregion described in this paper belongs to this category of\nacceleration process. Chiu and Schulz [1978] estimated the\npotential structure along the auroral field line on the basis of\nthe magnetic mirror process. One of their results is shown in\nthe form of an electric field profile in Figure 8 (curve a),\nwhere the electric field peaks in a rather narrow altitude\nrange (3000\u20135000 km) consistent with the present study.\nThe observed pre-onset phenomena can also be understood\nby the enhancement of this electric field. At the end of the\nsubstorm growth phase, the tail current is increased [e.g.,\nMcPherron, 1972; Ohtani et al., 1992, 2000] and the low-\naltitude inverted-V electric field along the auroral oval is\nenhanced. The electron beams accelerated by this low-\naltitude electric field activate the auroral arc on the oval\nand also generate and\/or intensify the low-altitude AKR.\nAccording to the equation by Knight [1973], the FAC is also\nenhanced which results in the intensification of the west-\nward electrojet current in the ionosphere, inducing a nega-\ntive excursion of the quasi-DC dH\/dt component with short-\nperiod fluctuation (Figures 6d and 6e). The feedback system\nbetween the magnetosphere and ionosphere may work in\nthis phase, leading to still stronger FAC, through the\nmechanism such as feedback instability [Sato, 1978;\nFigure 7. Negative excursion of dH\/dt signals before substorm onset. The hatched portion in each panel\nindicates quasi-DC variation in dH\/dt signal toward negative prior to onset. The arrow above each figure\nindicates onset of midlatitude Pi 2 pulsation detected by SAMNET stations. Examples shown were\ngathered during 4 weeks (16 April to 13 May 1996) at Tjornes-Syowa conjugate-pair stations.\nA09213 MORIOKA ET AL.: AKR BREAKUP AND PARTICLE ACCELERATION\n11 of 14\nA09213\nWatanabe et al., 1993]. Present observations showed that\nthese precursor-like processes usually occur 1\u20133 minutes\nbefore substorm onset. This period would be intimately\nconnected with the \u2018\u2018explosive growth phase\u2019\u2019 in the near-\nEarth plasma sheet suggested by Ohtani et al. [1992, 2000].\n[37] The drastic appearance of a high-altitude acceleration\nregion at substorm onset means that the buildup of the\nregion is due to the explosive acceleration process on the\nfield line of the local onset site. Among various theories for\nthe generation of the field-aligned acceleration [Borovsky,\n1993], the time-dependent mechanisms can be categorized\ninto (1) anomalous resistivity as the consequence of wave\ninstabilities such as current driven instability [Kindel and\nKennel, 1971], (2) microscopic double layers such as ion-\nacoustic double layers [Sato and Okuda, 1981] and electron\nholes [Pottelette and Treumann, 2005], (3) kinetic Alfve\u00b4n\nwaves [e.g., Lysak and Lotko, 1996; Lysak and Song, 2003],\nand (4) shear flow evolution in the plasma sheet which\nresults in the field-aligned acceleration [e.g., Birn and\nHesse, 1991]. Although the present observations do not\nenable to identify the most probable mechanism for the\nhigh-altitude acceleration, the mechanism is restricted, in\naddition to the explosive growth to complete the accelera-\ntion (within 30 seconds), to have an effective acceleration\naltitude of 6000\u201312000 km. In Figure 8, the estimated\naltitude profile of the drift velocity of the FAC electrons\n[Mozer et al., 1977; Morooka and Mukai, 2003] and the\nAlfve\u00b4n velocity along the L = 7 field line are shown (curves\nb and c) using the vertical electron density distribution on\nthe dusk side (21 MLT) observed by the Akebono satellite\n[Sato, 1998; Morioka et al., 2005]. The drift velocity of\nFAC carrier electrons has a broad maximum at around\n10,000 km. This seems to be preferable to the observed\nhigh-altitude acceleration and suggests that the mechanism\nfor the high-altitude acceleration is closely related to the FAC\nintensity and its altitude profile. The estimated Alfve\u00b4n veloc-\nity shows a peak at around 5000 km (curve c in Figure 8),\nindicating that the ionospheric Alfve\u00b4n resonator (IAR)\n[Polyakov and Rapoport, 1981] forms below this altitude.\nThis implies that Alfve\u00b4n waves are not effective for the\nhigh-altitude acceleration.\n[38] The critical issue for substorm onset is the causality\nbetween the sudden formation of the high-altitude field-\naligned acceleration in the M-I coupling region and the\nabrupt disruption of the near-Earth tail-current in the plasma\nsheet. Does the sudden acceleration in the M-I coupling\nregion ignite the tail-current disruption or does the tail-\ncurrent disruption in the plasma sheet induce the ionospheric\nacceleration? In the context of the present observation, it is\nnot unreasonable to assert that the sudden formation of the\nhigh-altitude field-aligned acceleration in the M-I coupling\nregion ignites the tail-current disruption when the intensi-\nfied acceleration in the M-I coupling region rapidly induces\nand accelerates the inflow of the tail-current into the\nionosphere. In this case, massive current is quickly injected\ninto the ionosphere from the plasma sheet; that is, the tail-\ncurrent is disrupted. The advantage of this hypothesis is that\nsubstorm onset is self-consistently determined through\ninteraction between the magnetosphere and ionosphere.\n5. Conclusions\n[39] We have investigated the dynamical behavior of\nAKR in connection with the auroral particle acceleration\nduring substorm onsets, using high-time-resolution wave\nspectrograms provided by Polar\/PWI electric field observa-\ntions. At the substorm onset, AKR showed explosive\ndevelopment at higher altitudes (6000\u201312,000 km) above\na preexisting low-altitude AKR source (4000\u20135000 km).\nThis AKR breakup suggests the abrupt formation of a new\nhigh-altitude field-aligned acceleration region at the sub-\nstorm onset. The growth time of the new acceleration\nregion is very short (increasing amplitude of 10,000 times\nwithin 30 seconds), suggesting a local and explosive devel-\nopment. The low-altitude AKR showed gradual enhance-\nment 1\u20133 minutes prior to the AKR breakup. This suggests\nthat the explosive formation of the high-altitude electric\nfield takes place in the course of the growing low-altitude\nacceleration; in other words, the development of a low-\naltitude acceleration region is a necessary condition for the\nignition of the high-altitude bursty acceleration.\n[40] Before the substorm onset, the quasi-DC component\nof dH\/dt (ULF) signal showed negative excursion that was\nalmost synchronized with the start of the gradual enhance-\nment of the low-altitude AKR, showing precursor-like\nbehavior for the substorm. This negative variation of dH\/\ndt suggests an exponentially increasing ionospheric current\ninduced by the upward FAC. At the substorm onset, the\ndecrease in the quasi-DC variation of dH\/dt is further\naccelerated, indicating a sudden enhancement of the FAC,\nthat is, the current disruption.\nFigure 8.
