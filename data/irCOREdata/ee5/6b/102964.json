This study\nexamined the supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer within England. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted in six\nacute NHS Trusts. Seven hundred and forty-one men with prostate cancer participated. They had been diagnosed 3\u201324 months\nprior to the survey and had received various treatments. Men surveyed had specific and significant unmet supportive care needs.\nAreas of greatest need are related to psychological distress, sexuality-related issues and management of enduring lower urinary tract\nsymptoms. High levels of psychological distress were reported, and those reporting psychological distress reported greater unmet\nsupportive care needs. Unmet sexuality-related need was highest in younger men following radical prostatectomy. Lower urinary\ntract symptoms were almost universal in the sample. Perceived quality of life varied; men unsure of their remission status reported\nlowest quality of life. Psychological distress impacts significantly on perceived unmet need and is currently not being assessed or\nmanaged well in men living with prostate cancer in England.\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2008) 98, 1903\u20131909. doi:10.1038\/sj.bjc.6604406 www.bjcancer.com\nPublished online 27 May 2008\n& 2008 Cancer Research UK\nKeywords: prostate cancer; lower urinary tract symptoms; quality of life; supportive care need\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nProstate cancer is the most common solid tumour malignancy in\nmen. In 2004, 29 406 new cases were diagnosed in England, and\ncomprised 25% of all male cancer diagnoses that year (Office for\nNational Statistics, 2006). Fortunately, the 5-year survival rate for\nthis male cancer is encouraging, reflecting the slow growing nature\nof the disease in many men and its successful treatment in others.\nSeventy-one per cent of men are alive 5 years after diagnosis\n(Office for National Statistics, 2007).\nVarious treatment options are available; management of men\nwith prostate cancer is generally determined by their stage of\ndisease, age and comorbidity (Harlan et al, 2001). Unsurprisingly,\nmen with localised disease have more treatment options, including\nopportunity for radical treatments including prostatectomy and\nradiotherapy, than men with locally advanced or metastatic\ndisease. However, there are wide variations in management\npractices for localised prostate cancer in the United Kingdom,\nreflecting the lack of consensus over what constitutes best\ntreatment (Hanna et al, 2002; Payne and Gillatt, 2007). Different\nprimary treatments for localised treatments typically confer\ncomparative cancer control (Litwin et al, 2007). Some urologists\nand oncologists take account of baseline urological and sexual\nfunction in optimising treatment options, usually in discussion\nwith the men themselves. Logically, patient experience will be\noptimised if the enduring side effects associated with the various\ntreatments, and consequential supportive care needs, are also\ntaken into account.\nSupportive care needs can be defined as requirements for care\narising during illness and treatment to manage symptoms and side\neffects, enable adaption and coping, optimise understanding and\ninformed decision-making, and minimise decrements in function-\ning. Limited evidence, generated primarily by four surveys, exists\non the supportive care needs of men living with prostate cancer.\nOne survey explored the supportive care needs of 206 men\nsubscribed to prostate cancer self-help groups in Queensland,\nAustralia (Steginga et al, 2001), another investigated the needs of\nmen (n\u00bc 204) with localised prostate cancer in four US sites\n(Boberg et al, 2003), Smith et al (2007) conducted a survey in New\nSouth Wales, Australia of 978 men under 70 years and newly\ndiagnosed with the disease, whereas Lintz et al (2003) conducted\nthe only UK survey. The latter surveyed needs of men attending a\nnon-surgical oncology clinic (n\u00bc 210). These surveys suggest that\nReceived 6 November 2007; revised 28 March 2008; accepted 15 April\n2008; published online 27 May 2008\n*Correspondence: Dr E Ream; E-mail: emma.ream@kcl.ac.uk\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2008) 98, 1903 \u2013 1909\n& 2008 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved 0007 \u2013 0920\/08 $30.00\nwww.bjcancer.com\nC\nli\nn\nic\na\nl\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\nup to 87% of men with prostate cancer have elements of unmet\nsupportive care need (Steginga et al, 2001) with greatest unmet\nneed relating to sexuality and psychological issues (Steginga et al,\n2001; Lintz et al, 2003; Smith et al, 2007). Steginga et al (2001) and\nSmith et al (2007) determined that high need for patient care\nand support was associated with lower levels of education.\nFurther, Steginga et al (2001) determined that men who had had\nradiotherapy to the prostate and not in remission were at risk of\nhigh unmet need. Unfortunately, evidence generated by these\nstudies is compromised by the size and nature of their samples\n(none being widely representative of men living with prostate\ncancer). Further, most surveys were conducted outside the UK and\nmay not translate well to it as health care systems generally, and\ncommunity care specifically, differs between countries.\nTo date, the supportive care needs of men with prostate cancer\nwithin the United Kingdom have been poorly articulated. To\naddress this, a postal survey was undertaken in England across six\nsites to determine how the disease and its treatment affect men\nliving with prostate cancer and identify factors that account for\nthis experience.\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS\nData were collected for the survey prior to the conduct of a quasi-\nexperimental study evaluating the role of prostate cancer-specific\nclinical nurse specialists. These nurse specialists were put in post\nin various locations across the UK funded by The Prostate Cancer\nCharity to enhance the care provided to men with this malignancy.\nThe function of the survey was to provide context for the latter\nevaluation.\nThe aims of the survey were to:\n\u0002 Identify unmet supportive care needs in men living with\nprostate cancer\n\u0002 Determine predictors of unmet supportive care need\nStudy population\nA total of 1848 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer in\nthe 3\u201324 months prior to data collection, from across six NHS Trusts,\nwere written to by their consultant urologist inviting them to\nparticipate in the study. A standard letter was used. If men\ndid not respond, a further letter was not mailed out. The sites\n(St George\u2019s Healthcare NHS Trust in London, The Hillingdon Hospital\nNHS Trust, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust,\nYork Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Nottingham University\nHospitals NHS Trust and Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Founda-\ntion Trust) were selected to provide two in the north of England, two in\nthe midlands and two in the south. A postal questionnaire was sent to\nthe men (n\u00bc 820) who responded to the invitation. A further\nquestionnaire was posted to non-responders 3 weeks later. There were\nno exclusion criteria with men of all ages, stages of disease and\nethnicity being invited to participate in the survey. Data were collected\nbetween November 2004 and September 2005.\nSurvey questionnaire\nThe survey questionnaire comprised four discrete research tools.\n(1) The Supportive Care Needs Survey (Bonevski et al, 2000;\nSanson-Fisher et al, 2000) is a 34-item questionnaire that\nencompasses 4 dimensions \u2013 Physical and Daily Living (need\nrelated to physical symptoms and side effects of treatment),\nPsychological (need regarding emotions and coping), Sexu-\nality (need relating to sexual relationships), Patient care and\nSupport (need for information on treatment centres and\ninvestigations\/treatment). Additionally, a seven-item prostate-\nspecific module was used that measures need relating to\nurinary and bowel function, and self-image. For each item,\nrespondents report the level of need they have from one of the\nfollowing: no need, need satisfied, low need, moderate need or\nhigh need. Validity testing has supported the questionnaire\u2019s\nfactor structure; the five domains account for 72% of total\nvariance (McElduff et al, 2004). Internal reliability of 40.86\nhas been consistently reported (Bonevski et al, 2000; Steginga\net al, 2001; McElduff et al, 2004).\nPreceding analysis, data from this tool were classified into \u2018no\nneed\u2019 and \u2018some need\u2019 according to the author\u2019s instructions\n(McElduff et al, 2004). The former category incorporated \u2018no\nneed\u2019 and \u2018satisfied need\u2019, whereas the latter included \u2018low\u2019,\n\u2018moderate\u2019 and \u2018high\u2019 need.\n(2) The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (Barry et al,\n1992) was used to determine lower urinary tract symptoms\n(LUTS). The IPSS is an internationally used, psychometrically\nsound tool that measures severity of seven aspects: incomplete\nemptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak stream,\nstraining and nocturia. Respondents record answers on a scale\nthat ranges from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost always). According\nto the authors\u2019 instructions, these items were summed to\nprovide an overall score and then categorised to indicate mild\n(range 0\u2013 7), moderate (range 8\u2013 19) and severe (range 20\u201335)\nsymptoms (Barry et al, 1992). A further item requires men to\nrespond yes\/no regarding whether they are affected by\nincontinence.\n(3) The EuroQol EQ-5D and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale)\n(EuroQol group, 1990) is a widely-used tool to assess\nrespondents\u2019 perceived quality of life. The tool comprises\ntwo sections. The first includes five items measuring health\nstate \u2013 mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain\/discomfort and\nanxiety\/depression. Respondents chose from one of three\nresponses: no problem, some or moderate difficulty, or\nextreme difficulty. Prior to analysis, data from the EuroQol\nwere transposed to \u2018no problems\u2019 and \u2018some problems\u2019. The\nlatter incorporated \u2018some or moderate difficulty\u2019 and \u2018extreme\ndifficulty\u2019.\nThe second section consists of a vertical VAS (0\u2013100) valuing\nindividuals\u2019 health state.\n(4) A final section comprised additional questions on age and\nother demographic characteristics, including treatment\nreceived, sociodemographic and domestic status, and perceived\nremission status.\nData were not collected from patient records; demographic and\nclinical data were attained solely through patient self-report.\nEthical approval\nThe research proposal was submitted to and gained MREC\napproval from the Metropolitan Multicentre Research Ethics\nCommittee (REC reference 04\/MRE11\/6), prior to conduct of the\nstudy.\nAnalysis\nDemographic and clinical characteristics were described according\nto the categories of unmet supportive care need. w2 tests were\nundertaken to identify associations. Results reported in this paper\nrelate to demographic and clinical factors that were consistently\nassociated with unmet need. These were age, treatment adminis-\ntered and perceived remission status. Backward logistic regression\nanalysis was performed on The Supportive Care Needs Survey data\nto determine predictors of need for each domain. Interactions\nbetween predictors were explored. The following factors were\nutilised as predictors: age, educational level, domestic status,\nmental affect (attained from the EuroQol item on depression\/\nanxiety), time since diagnosis, treatment modality, treatment\nSupportive care needs of men with prostate cancer\nE Ream et al\n1904\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2008) 98(12), 1903 \u2013 1909 & 2008 Cancer Research UK\nC\nlin\nic\na\nl\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\nstatus, time since treatment and remission status. All analyses were\nperformed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nRESULTS\nEight hundred and twenty (44%) of the 1847 men informed about\nthe study expressed interest in it and were mailed the survey\nquestionnaire. Of these, 749 returned it (response rate to\nquestionnaire 91%, overall response 41%). Eight questionnaires\nwere incomplete; results are reported on 741 men. Their mean age\nwas 70.2 years (s.d. 8.5). Mean time elapsed since diagnosis\nwas 14.3 months (s.d. 6.2). The sample reported that they had\nreceived various treatments following diagnosis, most common\nwere hormone therapy (n\u00bc 376, 51%), radiotherapy to prostate\n(n\u00bc 209, 28%) and radical prostatectomy (n\u00bc 188, 5%). Some\nstated that they had had a combination of these therapies. A\nrelatively small proportion reported that they were yet to receive\ntreatment, that is, they were on active monitoring or watchful wait\nprotocols (n\u00bc 124, 17%). Caucasian British males dominated the\nsample (n\u00bc 675, 91%). Most men had not attained formal\neducational qualifications (n\u00bc 341, 46%). The majority believed\nthey were in remission (n\u00bc 342, 46%) and at the time data\ncollected were not undergoing any form of treatment for prostate\ncancer (n\u00bc 344, 47%) (Table 1).\nSupportive care needs\nTo determine the extent of unmet need within each domain\n(except the prostate domain), a numeric score was attributed to\neach category of need (low need scored 1, moderate need scored 2\nand high need scored 3) and a mean value calculated. This was not\nundertaken with the prostate domain as it is relatively new and it is\nunclear how its individual items relate to one another (McElduff\net al, 2004). Unmet sexuality-related need was greatest with a mean\nvalue of 1.42. All other domains scored on average o1.\nThe w2 tests identified that need related to sexuality was\nsignificantly associated with both age (P\u00bco0.001) and treatment\n(P\u00bc 0.001) (Tables 2 and 3). There was a clear downward trend by\nage (Table 2). With regards to treatment, proportionally more men\nwho had undergone radical prostatectomy reported sexuality-\nrelated needs when compared with other subgroups of men (51 vs\n2\u201340%). Further 45% of men who had undergone multiple\ntreatments reported some unmet sexuality-related need. Conversely,\nthe relatively small group of men in receipt of brachytherapy\nexperienced little sexuality-related need.\nTreatment was also associated with physical and daily living\nneed (Po0.001) (Table 3). More men having combinations of\ntreatment or undergoing hormone therapy reported unmet\nphysical and daily living need when compared across treatment\nregimes. However, it is also worth acknowledging that these\ntreatments are typically prescribed for men with advanced disease.\nAgain, men who had undergone brachytherapy reported fewer\nneeds related to this domain.\nPsychological need was associated with remission status\n(P\u00bc 0.001) as was health system\/information need (P\u00bco0.001)\n(Table 4). Psychological need was most prevalent in men who\nwere uncertain of their remission status, whereas health system\/\ninformation need was most associated with men not in remission.\nData relating to the individual prostate items determined that\nacross three of the individual prostate items (hot flushes, bowel\nhabits and feeling that you have lost part of your manhood), need\nwas significantly associated with treatment type (Pp0.001). No\none treatment was more greatly associated with all prostate\nsymptoms (Table 5). Rather, hot flushes were most problematic in\nmen having hormone therapy, bowel problems with brachytherapy\nand multiple treatments, and feeling that you have lost part of your\nmanhood most associated with radical prostatectomy and multiple\ntreatment combinations.\nPredictors of unmet supportive care need\nLogistic regression revealed that treatment, age and mental affect\nwere significant factors impacting on the Physical and Daily living\ndomain (Table 6). Older men, and men who received multiple\ntreatments, were more likely to express unmet physical and daily\nliving need. However, the factor that placed men most at risk of\nneed in this domain was low mental affect. Men with some\ndepression and\/or anxiety were five times more likely to express\noutstanding physical and daily living need compared with men not\nreporting anxiety and\/or depression. With regard to unmet\npsychological need, two predictors were identified \u2013 time since\ndiagnosis and, unsurprisingly, low mental affect. Psychological\nneed was less likely to arise as time elapsed following treatment,\nbut was 10 times more likely in men with low mood. Predictors of\nsexuality-related need comprised age, treatment, treatment status\nand mental affect. Prostatectomy and hormone therapy were the\nTable 1 Characteristics of the sample (N\u00bc 741)\nN %\nAge (years)\no65 180 24\n65\u201369 164 22\n70\u201375 171 23\n75\u201380 121 16\n80o 105 14\nTime since diagnosis (months)\n3\u20136 96 13\n7\u201312 223 30\n13\u201318 204 28\n19\u201324 218 29\nTreatment receiveda\nHormone therapy 376 51\nRadiotherapy to prostate 209 28\nRadical prostatectomy 188 25\nWatchful wait 124 17\nBrachytherapy 26 4\nOther treatments 54 7\nState of remission\nIn remission 342 46\nNot in remission 231 32\nUncertain 142 19\nMissing data 26 3\nEducation\nNo formal qualifications 341 46\nGCSE (or equivalent) 110 15\nA level (or equivalent) 95 13\nHigher educational qualification 131 18\nMissing data 64 9\nEthnicity\nBritish 675 91\nIrish 22 3\nAfrican or Caribbean 22 3\nIndian, Pakistani or other Asian background 8 1\nMixed race 14 2\nTreatment status\nTreatment in past 344 47\nOn treatment 273 37\nWatchful wait\/no treatment 122 17\nMissing data 2 \u2014\naSome individuals received more than one type of therapy.\nSupportive care needs of men with prostate cancer\nE Ream et al\n1905\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2008) 98(12), 1903 \u2013 1909& 2008 Cancer Research UK\nC\nli\nn\nic\na\nl\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\ntwo treatments that placed men at risk of sexuality-related need.\nHowever, the single most important factor was once again mental\naffect. Low mood increased risk of sexuality-related need by 3.7\ntimes. As with previous elements of supportive care need, low\nmood was the most significant predictor of both the Patient Care\nand Support domain and Health Systems\/Information domain.\nExperience of LUTS\nIn the month prior to the survey, almost the entire sample\n(n\u00bc 726, 97%) experienced at least one of the following:\nincomplete emptying, frequency, intermittency, urgency, weak\nstream, straining or nocturia. Responses to individual items were\nsummed and classified to indicate whether overall urinary\nsymptoms were mild (scores 0 \u20137), moderate (8\u201319) or severe\n(20\u2013 35). This revealed that 356 men (50%) were mildly sympto-\nmatic, 288 men (39%) moderately so and 82 men (11%) had severe\nurinary symptoms. Of the 726 men who completed the final item\nregarding incontinence, 144 (19%) reported difficulty with leaking\nurine.\nInferential statistics confirmed that perceived severity of urinary\nsymptoms was impacted by treatment (Po0.001), remission status\n(Po0.001) and time since last treatment (P\u00bc 0.029). Urinary\nsymptoms were least severe in men who were in remission, and\/or\nhad undergone radical prostatectomy, and\/or completed their\ntreatment regimen 19 \u201324 months prior to the survey.\nQuality of life\nAround a quarter of the sample experienced problems with four of\nthe five quality of life domains measured. Moderate or extreme\nanxiety or depression was reported by 227 (30%) men, difficulty\nwith undertaking usual activities was reported by a further 221\nmen (30%), some or extreme pain was reported by 192 men (26%),\nand problems with mobility arose in 167 (22%) of those sampled.\nConversely, difficulty with self-care was evident in only 56 men\n(7%).\nThe w2 testing identified that age, treatment and remission status\nwere significantly associated with impairments to these dimen-\nsions of quality of life (Tables 2\u20134). Age was significantly\nassociated with reduced mobility (Po0.001) and difficulty in\nperforming usual activities (Po0.001), with older men reporting\nmore problems with these domains (Table 2). Treatment was\nsignificantly associated with both problems with mobility\n(Po0.001) and pain (Po0.001). Certain treatment regimes \u2013\nhormone therapy, watchful waiting\/active monitoring and those\nentailing multiple treatments \u2013 were allied with greater pain and\nreduced mobility (Table 3). Remission status was associated with\nfour quality of life domains: depression\/anxiety (Po0.001),\nreduced mobility (Po0.001), difficulty performing usual activities\n(Po0.001) and pain (P\u00bc 0.001) (Table 4). Across each of these\nfour domains, proportionally more men not in remission reported\nsome difficulty when compared with those either in remission or\nunsure of their remission status.

This\nwas particularly evident with regards to psychological care needs.\nThe survey identified high levels of psychological distress within\nthe sample even though the majority (57%) had completed\ntreatment over a year previously. Need for psychological care\nwas particularly high in men not in remission and in those\nuncertain of their remission status. This might be due to\nheightened feelings of uncertainty in these men. Recognition of\nthe contribution of uncertainty to psychological distress in men\nwith prostate cancer is not new. It is acknowledged to be\nparticularly associated with watchful wait or active monitoring\nprotocols (Wallace, 2003; Bailey et al, 2004) and reported to be\npresent in survivors of the disease (Talcott, 2006).\nUnfortunately, this study did not explicitly survey the pre-\nvalence of either anxiety or depression. Indeed, there is little\nevidence on how much these psychological symptoms affect men\ntreated for prostate cancer. Some understanding is provided by\nKorfage et al (2006) who undertook a 5-year follow-up in\nRotterdam of 299 men treated for local disease. They determined\nthat 25% men experienced high anxiety before treatment. This\ndecreased 6 months post-treatment and remained lower through-\nout the 5-year follow-up period. They concluded that most, but\nnot all, men adjust well psychologically following treatment for\nlocalised prostate cancer. The current study suggests that men\nunsure of their remission status may not adjust as well. This\nsupports the National Audit Office findings (National Audit Office,\n2005) that many men with prostate cancer wish more information\non how their disease has responded to treatment.\nThe current study identified that psychological need\ntypically decreased with time, as did Steginga et al (2004).\nThe latter determined that at diagnosis 63% of men had high\ndecision-related distress that persisted for 42% of men 12 months\nafter treatment.\nThe need for systematic assessment and better management of\npsychological distress within men with prostate cancer was evident\nin this study. Regression analysis identified that this variable was a\nstrong predictor of supportive care need. Across all domains\nmeasured, men with psychological distress had greater unmet\nsupportive care needs. Nurse-led interventions for uncertainty\nhave been developed and evaluated (Mishel et al, 2002; Bailey et al,\n2004), as have those for depression (McCorkle et al, 2007).\nArguably, a clinical nurse specialist could deliver such interven-\ntions following the requisite training.\nAdditionally, a high level of unmet sexuality-related need was\nreported. Younger men, with a good prognosis following curative\nradical prostatectomy, were more greatly affected. Radical\nprostatectomy is known to impact on libido and erectile\nfunction\/sexual performance (Talcott et al, 2003; Matthew et al,\n2005; Ponholzer et al, 2006). However, the men in this group are\nalso more likely to be sexually active due to their age, and so find\nimpotency and changes in sexual desire more problematic.\nAs with uncertainty and psychological distress, problems with\nsexuality are not necessarily evident; men may be reluctant to\nbring sexuality-related issues to the fore, given the stigma\nassociated with them. Clinically important sexuality-related need\nwill only be identified through systematic assessment.\nThis survey also identified that LUTS were almost universal in\nmen up to 2 years following treatment for prostate cancer. Lower\nurinary tract symptoms transcend stage of disease, treatment\nadministered and stage of treatment. Their high prevalence in\nthis survey (97%) is indicative of the difficulty associated with\nTable 4 Significant associations between remission status and supportive\ncare need and quality of life domains\nIn remission\nNo Yes Unsure\nN (%) N (%) N (%) P-value\nHealth system\/information\nSome health system\/information\nneed\n118 (51) 112 (33) 59 (43) o0.001\nPsychology\nSome psychological need 63 (27) 72 (21) 43 (31) 0.001\nDepression\/anxiety\nSome depression and\/or anxiety 91 (40) 83 (24) 48 (34) o0.001\nMobility\nSome mobility problems 70 (30) 58 (17) 35 (25) 0.001\nUsual activities\nSome problems with usual activities 86 (37) 80 (23) 47 (33) 0.001\nPain\nSome pain\/discomfort 88 (38) 66 (19) 32 (23) 0.001\nTable 5 Significant associations between treatment and prostate-specific supportive care need items\nTreatment\nWatchful\nwait\/active\nmonitoring\nRadiotherapy\nto prostate\nRadiotherapy\nto prostate+\nhormone\ntherapy\nHormone\ntherapy\nRadical\nprostatectomy\nMultiple\ncombinations Brachytherapy\nN (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) N (%) P-value\nHot flushes\nSome need 11 (9) 7 (16) 42 (30) 61 (32) 8 (5) 15 (29) 2 (8) o0.001\nBowel problems\nSome need 23 (19) 7 (16) 35 (25) 38 (20) 13 (8) 18 (35) 10 (38) o0.001\nLost part of manhood\nSome need 28 (23) 11 (26) 58 (41) 60 (31) 73 (45) 22 (42) 7 (27) 0.001\nSupportive care needs of men with prostate cancer\nE Ream et al\n1907\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2008) 98(12), 1903 \u2013 1909& 2008 Cancer Research UK\nC\nli\nn\nic\na\nl\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\nresolving them. However, prevalence is not dissimilar to that\nwithin a general population of elderly men (465 years) without\nprostate cancer (Taylor et al, 2006). Yet, although men in the\ngeneral population report a similar presence of LUTS, they appear\nless severe (Taylor et al, 2006). Fifty per cent of men sampled in\nthis survey of men living with prostate reported these symptoms to\nbe moderate or severe. This would appear unsatisfactory and may\nreflect current service delivery. Services for incontinence are well\nestablished within health care. Specific services for LUTS, however,\nare less common. The high prevalence and severity of LUTS in this\nsample would suggest that these symptoms require increased\nclinical attention within prostate services. They should be\naddressed from presentation and diagnosis, through treatment\nand during follow-up.\nHowever, although this is the largest survey of its kind to date to\nbe conducted in the UK and to have enjoyed a relatively healthy\nresponse rate, its limitations must be considered. Only men who\nconveyed interest in the study to the research team were invited to\nparticipate. This opt-in approach was stipulated by the approving\nethics committee in line with current requirement and illustrates\nthe impact of it on sample selection (Hewison and Haines, 2006).\nThe sample may be unrepresentative of all men living with this\ndisease. Men from black and mixed ethnic (BME) groups were\npoorly represented even though two research sites were selected\nfor their high proportion of BME groups in their local populations.\nThe study was also of cross-sectional design and included men at\ndifferent points in the treatment and recovery pathway. Many men\nhad completed treatment. Further, as baseline measures of\nsupportive care need, symptoms and quality of life prior to\ntreatment were not attained, it is not possible to determine how\nmuch the differences in outcome reported between treatment\ngroups relates to baseline factors rather than treatment-related\nones. Additionally, the survey relied on self-reported data related\nto treatment received and remission status. This approach is\nsubject to reporting bias.\nHowever, the study raises important points for debate concern-\ning the current provision of services for men with prostate cancer\nin England. It strongly indicates that further research is necessary\nto provide robust evidence on the long-term impact of prostate\ncancer. From a practice perspective, it suggests that greater\nattention should be paid to symptoms and problems that men may\nbe reticent to raise with professionals, perhaps due to perceived\nstigma associated with them. These include sexuality-related\nproblems, psychological distress, incontinence and LUTS, and\naltered bowel functioning. Management of these problems\nwould be improved through routine systematic screening of men\nat risk of developing them \u2013 this survey and others have\ndetermined that particular treatments are strongly associated with\nparticular sequelae. Further, resources need to be devoted to\nensuring that all men have access to the relevant specialist services,\nsome of which could be provided by specialist nurses with the\nrequisite training. Finally, this survey has highlighted that\npsychological distress is currently not being assessed or managed\nwell in men living with prostate cancer in England and this\ncontributes to much of their perceived unmet supportive care\nneed.\nTable 6 Predictors of unmet supportive care need\nDomain Predictor Odds ratio 95% CI P-value\nPhysical and daily living Depression 5.9 4.1, 8.6 o0.001\nTreatment 0.003\nRadical prostatectomy 1.1 0.6, 2.1 0.694\nRadiotherapy to prostate 2.3 1.0, 5.2 0.045\nRadiotherapy to prostate+hormone therapy 2.5 1.4, 4.4 0.002\nHormone therapy 1.9 1.1, 3.2 0.025\nBrachytherapy 1.0 0.3, 3.0 0.996\nMultiple treatments 3.5 1.6, 7.6 0.002\nWatchful wait\/active monitoring \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nAge 1.0 1.0, 1.1 0.02\nPsychological Time since diagnosis 1.0 0.9, 1.0 0.047\nDepression 10.7 7.0, 16.2 o0.001\nSexuality Age 1 0.9, 1.0 o0.001\nDepression 3.7 2.6, 5.2 o0.001\nTreatment 0.009\nRadical prostatectomy 2.7 1.5, 4.8 0.001\nRadiotherapy to prostate 1.5 0.6, 3.3 0.378\nRadiotherapy to prostate and hormone therapy 2.4 1.3, 4.4 0.005\nHormone therapy 3.4 1.7, 7.1 0.001\nBrachytherapy 2.4 0.9, 6.1 0.076\nMultiple treatments 2.9 1.3, 6.5 0.012\nWatchful wait\/active monitoring \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nTreatment status 0.005\nOn treatment 0.5 0.3, 0.8 0.005\nTreatment in past \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nPatient care and support Age 1.0 0.9, 1.0 0.023\nDepression 5.7 3.9, 8.2 o0.001\nHealth systems\/information Depression 3.8 2.7, 5.3 o0.001\nRemission status 0.001\nIn remission 0.5 0.4, 0.7 o0.001\nDo not know 0.8 0.5, 1.2 0.232\nNot in remission \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nSupportive care needs of men with prostate cancer\nE Ream et al\n1908\nBritish Journal of Cancer (2008) 98(12), 1903 \u2013 1909 & 2008 Cancer Research UK\nC\nlin\nic\na\nl\nS\ntu\nd\nie\ns\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe research on which this paper is based was commissioned by\nThe Prostate Cancer Charity.
