We investigate this possibility and find that the rate of magnetar production\nvia white dwarf\u2013white dwarf (WD\u2013WD) mergers in the Milky Way is comparable to the rate\nof production via core collapse. However, while the rate of production of magnetars by core\ncollapse is proportional to the star formation rate, the rate of production via WD\u2013WD mergers\n(which have long lifetimes) is proportional to the stellar mass density, which is concentrated\nin early-type systems. Therefore magnetars produced via WD\u2013WD mergers may produce soft\ngamma-repeater giant flares which can be identified with early-type galaxies. We also comment\non the possibility that this mechanism could produce a fraction of the observed short-duration\nburst population at higher redshift.\nKey words: white dwarfs \u2013 gamma-rays: bursts.\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nSoft gamma-repeaters (SGRs) are thought to be highly magne-\ntized neutron stars with rotational periods of seconds and strong\n(>1014 G) magnetic fields (Duncan & Thompson 1992; Kouveliotou\net al. 1998). They undergo frequent outbursts and occasional giant\nflares (Hurley et al. 1999; Palmer et al. 2005). These giant flares are\nsufficiently bright to be observed in external galaxies out to large\ndistances (>50 Mpc), and would be observable as a short-duration\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) (Hurley et al. 2005). However, the paucity\nof observed giant flares in our own Galaxy has so far precluded ob-\nservationally based determinations of either their luminosity func-\ntion or their rate.\nObservations of recently localized short-duration GRBs have\nshown them to be associated with a variety of host galaxy types\nat typical redshifts of z \u223c 0.2 (e.g. Gehrels et al. 2005; Fox et al.\n\u0002E-mail: levan@star.herts.ac.uk\n2005; Berger et al. 2005). Their energetics, and location in a vari-\nety of host galaxies, including those with little or no ongoing star\nformation, point to an origin in the merger of two compact objects,\neither neutron star\u2013neutron star or neutron star\u2013black hole (Bloom\net al. 2005; Hjorth et al. 2005).\nHowever, if at least some fraction of short-duration GRBs are due\nto SGRs in external galaxies, then it may be expected that some cor-\nrelation between the positions of bursts and the locations of galaxies\nin the local Universe would be seen. Tanvir et al. (2005, hereafter\nT05) have recently reported such a correlation, indicating that up to\n\u223c25 per cent of short-duration GRBs originate in the local Universe\n(within 100 Mpc). Intriguingly, this analysis shows a correlation\nwith all galaxy types, and is strongest when restricted to relatively\nearly-type galaxies (Sbc and earlier). SGRs are thought to be formed\nin the core collapse of massive stars, and because of relatively short\nlifetimes (\u223c104 yr, e.g. Kouveliotou 1999) would naturally be lo-\ncated in predominantly star-forming galaxies, while essentially none\nshould be seen in ellipticals. Two possibilities present themselves:\nthe first is that, rather than representing SGRs, the correlations\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS\nL2 A. J. Levan et al.\nreported by T05 are due to a different progenitor class, such as\nlow-luminosity neutron star mergers. The second possibility is that\nSGRs are not created exclusively by core-collapse events and can be\nfound in older stellar populations. This second option is the subject\nof this Letter.\nHere we consider an alternative model for the creation of SGRs,\nand thus potentially GRBs: namely SGRs that are created via the\naccretion-induced collapse (AIC) of white dwarfs to neutron stars\n(e.g. Nomoto & Kondo 1991). Such an AIC may occur in white\ndwarf\u2013white dwarf (WD\u2013WD) mergers (Usov 1992; King, Pringle\n& Wickramasinghe 2001), or rarely in binaries with more massive\nmain-sequence companions although the precise outcome of WD\u2013\nWD mergers remains uncertain, and may produce either a type Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) or an AIC. Once the magnetar has been created,\nits evolution will proceed in an analogous manner to those created\nvia core collapse.\n2 M A K I N G M AG N E TA R S F RO M W H I T E\nDWA R F M E R G E R S\nKing et al. (2001) first suggested that the merger of two white dwarfs\n(one or more of which was highly magnetic) may result in the pro-\nduction of a magnetar via AIC. Observational evidence for such a\nchannel can be found from the highly magnetic white dwarf RE\nJ0317\u2212853, which appears to be the result of the merger of two\nwhite dwarfs with a total mass marginally below the Chandrasekhar\nlimit. For more massive systems a magnetar may be formed.\nHowever, the required field strengths for the white dwarfs are\nvery large. Upon collapse the new magnetic field is given by B NS =\nB WD(RWD\/RNS)2. For typical white dwarf and neutron star param-\neters this implies that white dwarf B-fields of several hundred MG\nare necessary for magnetar creation. Such fields are relatively rare,\nbut do exist within the magnetic white dwarf population. Fig. 1\nshows the distribution of magnetic fields in isolated white dwarfs\nand in magnetic cataclysmic variables (Wickramasinghe & Ferrario\n2000; Schmidt et al. 2003; Norton, Wynn & Somerscales 2004;\nVanlandingham et al. 2005). As can be seen, a small fraction (\u223c10\nper cent) achieve the required field strengths. This may be consid-\nered a lower limit as magnetars may also be formed from stars with\nlower fields via post-collapse dynamos (e.g. Thompson & Duncan\n1995). Thus it is plausible that the AIC of a white dwarf during the\nmerging process could create a magnetar.\n3 T H E R AT E O F F O R M AT I O N O F\nM AG N E TA R S F RO M W D \u2013 W D M E R G E R S\nWe now proceed to estimate roughly the rate of formation of\nSGRs via the WD\u2013WD channel within the Milky Way. Initially\nwe construct a mass distribution containing both magnetic and\nnon-magnetic carbon\u2013oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (Fig. 2). The\nmass function for the non-magnetic systems is taken from Liebert,\nBergeron & Holberg (2005), exhibiting a broad structure with a peak\nat \u223c0.57 M\u0004. The mass function for highly magnetic white dwarfs\nis markedly different from this, and for this work is considered to be\nflat between 0.5 and 1.4 M\u0004 with a mean of 0.95 M\u0004 (this is con-\nsistent with current observations of magnetic white dwarfs: Liebert,\nBergeron & Holberg 2003; Nalezyty & Madej 2004). The fraction\nof magnetic white dwarfs (with B > 2 MG) within this model is\n9 per cent, again consistent with recent observations (e.g. Liebert\net al. 2003). For each white dwarf we obtain a radius using the\nformulation of Nauenberg (1972), and, for magnetic white dwarfs\ncalculate the B-field that would be formed upon collapse to a neu-\ntron star of radius 1 \u00d7 106 cm. We only consider CO white dwarfs\nFigure 1. The distribution of white dwarf magnetic fields seen in magnetic\ncataclysmic variables [black line \u2013 33 stars taken from Norton et al. (2004)]\nand isolated white dwarfs [red dashed line \u2013 148 stars with B > 2 MG,\ntaken from Wickramasinghe & Ferrario (2000), Schmidt et al. (2003) and\nVanlandingham et al. (2005)]. For magnetic cataclysmic variables we have\nconverted from magnetic moment to B-field assuming that R = 6 \u00d7 108 cm\n[the radius of a mean-mass (0.95 M\u0004) magnetic white dwarf]. A more\ndetailed description including the effects of the white dwarf mass\u2013radius\nrelation is given in Section 3. The inset shows the fields following collapse\ninto a neutron star of radius 1 \u00d7 106 cm. Magnetars are defined as having\nB > 1014 G.\nFigure 2. The mass distributions assumed for this work. The non-magnetic\nwhite dwarf distribution has been taken from Liebert et al. (2005), while the\nmagnetic distribution is assumed to be flat over the mass range of 0.5 < M\n< 1.4 M\u0004, as is shown in the hatched area. The relative numbers of white\ndwarfs in each population are those assumed here.\nsince although He\u2013He systems are the dominant double-degenerate\npopulation by number, they are of less interest as sources of magne-\ntars, since they will rarely exceed the Chandrasekhar mass. Detailed\npopulation synthesis calculations by Nelemans et al. (2001) find that\n\u223c25 per cent of the WD\u2013WD systems formed consist of two CO\nwhite dwarfs.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation C\u00a9 2006 RAS, MNRAS 368, L1\u2013L5\nShort GRBs in old populations L3\nFigure 3. The distribution of the combined masses of mergers of CO white\ndwarfs, where each component is picked to favour mass ratios close to unity\nas described in Section 3. The red dotted line shows the mass distribution of\ndouble-degenerate systems that contain a magnetic white dwarf. As can be\nseen, it is charaterized by a higher mean mass, due to the differing shape of\nthe magnetic white dwarf mass function. The dashed vertical line represents\nthe Chandrasekhar mass.\nWe do not consider the detailed evolutionary pathways that lead\nto the production of the WD\u2013WD binaries, but do pick white dwarfs\nfrom the mass distribution such that the observed mass ratios are\nconsistent with observations (Maxted, Marsh & Moran 2002). To\nthis end we pick the first white dwarf at random from the entire mass\ndistribution but then pick the secondary from a Gaussian function,\ncentred on the mass of the first WD with a FWHM of 20 per cent\nof this mass. This preferentially produces binaries with mass ratios\nclose to unity, in agreement with observations of double-degenerate\nsystems.\nWe find that the fraction of double-degenerate systems that form\nabove the Chandrasekhar mass is \u223c25 per cent of our population\n(or \u223c6 per cent of the total WD\u2013WD population if CO\u2013He and\nHe\u2013He systems are also considered). As we do not attempt de-\ntailed population synthesis calculations here, we instead normalize\nthe double degenerates created with masses > 1.4 M\u0004 against the\nrate obtained via population synthesis (Nelemans et al. 2001), so\nthat the rate of such mergers is 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 yr\u22121. Of this population,\n\u223c40 per cent contain at least one magnetic white dwarf. Although\nthis appears to be a larger fraction than might naturally be antici-\npated, it is due to the fact that magnetic white dwarfs exhibit a higher\nmean mass, so that the distribution of WD\u2013WD binaries contain-\ning a magnetic white dwarf is biased towards higher masses (see\nFig. 3 \u2013 at masses above \u223c1 M\u0004 the mass function of magnetic\nwhite dwarfs contributes approximately the same number of stars\nas the non-magnetic population). In approximately 10 per cent of\nthe double-degenerate systems (with M > 1.4 M\u0004) the magnetic\nfields are sufficiently strong to form a magnetar should an AIC occur\nupon merger.\n4 D I S C U S S I O N\nThe currently popular picture for the production of magnetars is that\nthey result from the core collapse of stars more massive than 40 M\u0004\n(e.g. Gaensler et al. 2005). The rate of production of such stars within\nthe Galaxy is \u223c6 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121 (Podsiadlowski et al. 2004). The rate\nof SGRs (created by both WD\u2013WD and core-collapse channels)\ncan also be estimated based on the observed number within our\nGalaxy. Given a lifetime of 104 yr and the observed number within\nthe Milky Way (four), the estimated rate is \u223c 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121. The\nlocation of the observed Galactic SGRs within the Galactic plane\nand the association in some cases with young stellar clusters make\nit reasonable to assume that all of the Galactic SGRs have been\ncreated via core collapse, although this is not certain. The total rate\nis also a lower limit since it is possible that some Galactic SGRs\nhave been quiescent and have thus far evaded detection.\nNelemans et al. (2001) estimate a rate of mergers of white dwarf\nbinaries with masses higher than the Chandrasekhar mass of 3 \u00d7\n10\u22123 yr\u22121. Thus if \u223c10 per cent of these systems create a magnetar\nthen we expect a Galactic rate of magnetar production via WD\u2013WD\nmergers of 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121. This this is comparable to the rate inferred\nfrom core collapse.\nThe rate of core-collapse events within the local Universe should\ntrace the massive star formation rate (SFR), while the rate of SGRs\nformed via WD\u2013WD mergers will better trace the stellar mass den-\nsity, since the merger of the white dwarf pair can occur several Gyr\nafter the star formation that created the white dwarf progenitors.\nIn early-type systems the rate of production of SGRs via WD\u2013WD\nmergers will be significantly larger than via core collapse. For exam-\nple, in an early-type galaxy, the SFR may be \u223c0.1 M\u0004 yr\u22121, while\nthe stellar mass may be similar to the Milky Way. In such systems the\nrate of production via core collapse would be \u223c 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 yr\u22121, while\nthe rate of production via WD\u2013WD mergers would be unchanged at\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121, a factor of 10 higher than the core-collapse rate.\nGiven the SFR and stellar mass of the Milky Way [following the\ncalculations of Nelemans et al. (2001), we assume SFR= 4 M\u0004 yr\u22121\nand M disc = 8 \u00d7 1010 M\u0004], we estimate the rate of production by\nWD\u2013WD mergers and by core-collapse events to be \u0005WD\u2212WD \u2248\n3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121 \u00d7 (M\/1011 M\u0004) and \u0005CC \u2248 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121 \u00d7\n[SFR\/(M\u0004 yr\u22121)]. An extrapolation of this to the local Universe is\nshown in Fig. 4. The rates of SGR production via core collapse and\nWD\u2013WD mergers are comparable within the uncertainties. Thus\nSGRs produced via WD\u2013WD mergers would naturally predict a\ncorrelation between the locations of short GRBs and galaxies of all\ntypes in the local Universe. Indeed, the total rate of SGR production\nin earlier type galaxies (T-type 4 and earlier, where T05 find their\nstrongest correlation) is predicted to be \u223c 0.2 yr\u22121, or 70 per cent\nof the total SGR production, providing a natural explanation of this\nresult. Some enhancement of the rate of WD\u2013WD mergers may\nalso be seen in globular clusters where the systems can be formed\ndynamically as well as via the normal binary evolution channels.\nAlthough this enhancement is probably only modest (see e.g. Davies\n& Benz 1995), it would primarily act to enhance the rate of mergers\nin very early-type systems, where a large number of globular clusters\nare found.\nThe predicted total rate of \u223c 0.3 yr\u22121 combined with the life-\ntime of SGRs of 1 \u00d7 104 yr implies that within a velocity cut of\n<2000 km s\u22121 there exist \u223c3000 SGRs. The results of T05 indicate\nthat \u223c3 short GRBs per year occur within this volume. If this is the\ncase then it implies that the rate of SGR giant flares is approximately\none per SGR every 1000 yr (i.e. within the Milky Way where there\nare four SGRs, a giant flare of the magnitude of that seen from SGR\n1806\u221220 in 2004 December would be expected every 250 yr). This\nis not unreasonable, since it is thought that giant flares similar to that\nseen in SGR 1806\u221220 might release \u223c10 per cent of the magnetar\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.

Top: the distribution of different T-types within the Third Refer-\nence Catalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3 \u2013 de Vaucouleurs et al. 1995) with\nv < 2000 km s\u22121. The T-type distribution runs along the Hubble sequence\nbetween \u22126 (elliptical) and 11 (irregular); the Hubble type for a given T-type\nis indicated in the top panel. Middle: the cumulative distribution of stellar\nmass (red dashed) and star formation (black solid) within the same velocity\ncut; the model for stellar mass and star formation assumed to create this\nis described in Appendix A. As can be seen, much of the stellar mass is\nmaintained in early-type systems, while star formation takes place predomi-\nnantly in later systems. The lower panel shows the extrapolated rates of SGRs\nwhich follow (red dashed line) the stellar mass at a rate of 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121\n\u00d7 (M\/1011 M\u0004) and follow (solid black line) the star formation rate as\n1 \u00d7 10\u22124 yr\u22121 \u00d7 (SFR\/M\u0004 yr\u22121). Within the considerable uncertainties,\nthe rates of each channel within the local Universe are comparable and thus\nwe may expect to see a correlation between the locations of short bursts and\nall galaxy types. The blue dot\u2013dashed line shows the cumulative rate of SGR\nformation via both channels. As can be seen, the rate of formation in earlier\ntype galaxies (T-type 4 and earlier) accounts for \u223c 70 per cent of the total\nrate.\ndipole energy, therefore this rate fits well with the estimated lifetime\nof SGRs of 104 yr.\nIt is interesting to note that a primary piece of evidence used to\nargue that the recently located short-burst population is the result\nof compact binary (neutron star or black hole) mergers is the asso-\nciation of short GRBs with all galaxy types, including those with\nlittle or no ongoing star formation. This immediately rules out any\nconnection with events requiring ongoing star formation. Under the\nstandard assumption that SGRs are produced via core collapse, this\nobservation can also be used to argue that SGRs cannot be respon-\nsible for the recent well-localized short-duration bursts. However,\nit should be noted that under our proposed model we would expect\nto locate bursts in all galaxy types. Indeed, the galaxy type frac-\ntions for WD\u2013WD mergers may be similar to those of SNe Ia, or\nmay even be biased to typically earlier type galaxies if the SN Ia\npopulation is represented by two progenitor classes [one of which\nis enhanced in younger populations (e.g. Mannucci, Della Valle &\nPanagia 2005b)]. Given the long lifetimes of the WD\u2013WD dwarf\nsystems, we would not expect to find them in or near regions of mas-\nsive star formation, and in this sense their locations in host galax-\nies may be similar to those of neutron star\u2013neutron star mergers.\nHowever, the dynamics of their formation will differ from neutron\nstar\u2013neutron star and neutron star\u2013black hole binaries (in the sense\nthat WD\u2013WD systems will not have natal kicks as neutron stars\ndo), and so the location of bursts around their hosts may enable the\ndistinction between different models.\nThere are limits to the energetics that can feasibly be achieved\nvia SGR giant flares. Those observed within the Milky Way have\nachieved luminosities up to 1046 erg, although Hurley et al. (2005)\ncomment that it may be possible to achieve luminosities a factor of\n100 greater. None the less, the most luminous short-duration bursts\nwith energies of 1050 erg would appear to be beyond the energies that\ncan be created via SGRs, implying that two populations of bursts are\nstill required. Ultimately observations of SGRs in nearby galaxies\nmay enable the determination of their luminosity function and fix\nthe rate at which they occur.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe have presented a mechanism for the production of magnetars\nvia AIC following the merger of two white dwarfs in a tight bi-\nnary. Considering the observed mass and magnetic field distribu-\ntions for white dwarfs, it appears that the rate of formation of SGRs\nvia this process in the local Universe is comparable to the produc-\ntion rate via the core-collapse channel (although possibly slightly\nlower than the core-collapse channel in the Milky Way). In early-\ntype galaxies the WD\u2013WD mechanism is the dominant producer of\nSGRs, while in late-type galaxies most SGRs are produced via core\ncollapse. Thus it would be expected that SGR flares appearing as\nshort-duration GRBs may be found from galaxies of all types, and\nthis naturally explains the correlation seen between the locations\nof BATSE short-duration bursts and early-type galaxies in the local\nUniverse.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nWe thank the referee for a rapid and constructive report, and for\ncomments on the white dwarf mass\u2013radius relation.

We then cross-correlate the\npositions of these galaxies with the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey\n(2MASS) extended source catalogue to obtain B \u2212 K colours for\neach of the galaxies. We are then able to estimate the mass of each in-\ndividual galaxy using the relation given by Mannucci et al. (2005a):\nlog\n(\nM\/L K\nM\u0004\/L\u0004\n)\n= 0.212(B \u2212 K ) \u2212 0.959. (A1)\nHaving ascertained the mass, we now derive rough estimates\nfor the star formation contained within each galaxy T-type. We\nestimate this based on the mean SFR of galaxies of a given\nT-type (from Shane & James 2002). The rates that we as-\nsume are E (0 M\u0004 yr\u22121), S0 (0.2 M\u0004 yr\u22121), Sa (0.25 M\u0004 yr\u22121),\nSb (0.5 M\u0004 yr\u22121), Sc (1.4 M\u0004 yr\u22121), Scd (1.1 M\u0004 yr\u22121), Sd\n(0.7 M\u0004 yr\u22121) and Irr (0.15 M\u0004 yr\u22121). While these numbers only\ncrudely estimate the SFR for a given galaxy, the total SFR obtained\nvia this assumption is in agreement with the extrapolation of the\nlocal SFR to v < 2000 km s\u22121 (Gallego et al. 1995).\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX\/LATEX file prepared by the author.\nC\u00a9 2006 The Authors.
