Introduction  1 \nAround 5000 structurally determined isoprenoids have been identified, including 2 \nmonoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes (C20) and higher molecular weight 3 \nspecies (Geron et al., 2000). Monoterpenes (C10H16) are the simplest family of 4 \nisoprenoids (>1000 compounds), forming an array of acyclic and cyclic structures (Fall, 5 \n1999). Most studies investigating biogenic isoprenoids have focused on emissions from 6 \nfoliage to the atmosphere, and only limited attention has been paid to subsurface 7 \nemissions (Hayward et al., 2001). However, isoprenoids have been detected in litter 8 \nemissions, and are likely products of microbial activity (Isidorov and Jdanova, 2002; 9 \nIsidorov et al., 2003) or derivatives of root exudates (Lin et al., 2007). The degradation 10 \nof monoterpenes by indigenous soil microflora has also been demonstrated (Owen et al., 11 \n2007). In a review of secondary plant metabolites in phytoremediation, Singer et al 12 \n(2003) summarised research by Focht (1995), who proposed that plant terpenes 13 \n(particularly monoterpenes and sesquiterpene) might be natural analogues for PCB 14 \noxidation, and subsequent studies have investigated the efficacy of amending PCB-15 \ncontaminated soil with biogenic terpenes in an effort to induce and\/or enhance PCB 16 \ndegradation (Focht, 1995; Gilbert and Crowley, 1997; Hernandez et al., 1997; Tandlich 17 \net al., 2001). It may be that exogenous sources of terpenes may enhance the growth and 18 \nreproduction of PCB-degrading microorganisms and induce the genes encoding 19 \nenzymes involved in PCB degradation. Indeed, Leigh et al. (2007) demonstrated that 20 \nthere was a very active biphenyl-degrading capacity in indigenous microbes in the 21 \nrhizosphere soil of Pinus nigra, using an innovative stable isotope probing technique. 22 \nThis suggestion that degradation of PCBs in soil might be enhanced by analogue 23 \nenrichment was made almost forty years ago (Raymond and Alexander, 1971), and 24 \nsubsequently revived twenty years later (e.g. Brunner et al., 1985). More recently, it has 25 \nbeen suggested that plant terpenes are likely co-metabolites for PCB degradation due to 26 \n  \n3 \ntheir structural similarity to biphenyl (Hernandez et al., 1997; Singer et al., 2003 and 1 \nreferences therein), which can facilitate biodegradation of PCBs through co-2 \nmetabolism. However, biphenyl can not be applied to PCB-contaminated land because 3 \nit is also harmful to the environment. The ability of soil microorganisms to utilize root 4 \nexudates, particularly isoprenoids, as their sole carbon and energy source (Cleveland 5 \nand Yavitt, 1998) may justify the hypothesis that isoprenoids emitted within the soil 6 \nprofile may also enhance the biodegradation of PCBs through co-metabolism, and they 7 \nhave the advantage of being harmless to the environment.  8 \n 9 \nThe terpene isoprenoids limonene and \u03b1-pinene were selected for investigation as 10 \nthey are plant-derived compounds that dominate woodland soil emissions (Steinbrecher 11 \net al., 1999; Hayward et al., 2001; Isidorov and Jdanova, 2002; Isidorov et al., 2003; Lin 12 \net al., 2007) , and are readily degraded by indigenous microorganisms (Misra et al., 13 \n1996; Misra and Pavlostathis, 1997; Owen et al., 2007); both possess a cyclic structure 14 \nwith a chemical structure closely related to 2,4-DCP. In aerated soil, 2,4-dichlorophenol 15 \n(DCP) is the main catabolic metabolite of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), a 16 \nwidely used selective systemic herbicide (Tomlin, 1997). Several studies have 17 \ndemonstrated that 2,4-DCP is biodegradable under both aerobic and anaerobic 18 \nconditions with several pathways of degradation identified (Haggblom, 1992). Because 19 \n2,4-DCP is considered representative of common soil and water contaminants (Xing and 20 \nPignatello, 1998), it was selected as the test contaminant for this study. While this paper 21 \nfocuses exclusively on terpenoid compounds as structural analogues of 2,4 DCP, it is 22 \nrecognised that there are thousands of other secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids 23 \nwhich have a basic 10-carbon ring skeleton, which may also function as structural 24 \nanalogues and co-metabolites of 2,4 DCP and other persistent organic pollutants in soil 25 \nsystems. 26 \n  \n4 \n 1 \nPrevious work on the influence of co-substrate concentration on contaminant 2 \nmineralisation are limited, although Tandlich et al. (2001) suggested that biodegradation 3 \nof PCBs is independent of the concentration of co-substrate used (10 mg l-1 and 20 mg l-4 \n1). Aged woodland soils have also shown higher levels of [UL-14C] 2,4-DCP 5 \nmineralisation than fresh soils, which was significantly enhanced by the addition of 6 \nmonoterpenes (Rhodes et al., 2007). 7 \n 8 \nIn this study, the use of monoterpenes as a natural analogue for the stimulation of 9 \n2,4-DCP degradation was investigated, by quantifying (i) the ability of indigenous 10 \nmicroorganisms in soils associated with monoterpene emitting vegetation to metabolise 11 \n2,4-DCP; (ii) the effect of pre-exposure on degradative ability; and (iii) the effect of 12 \nmonoterpene (co-substrate) concentration on catabolic activity.  13 \n 14 \n  \n5 \n2. Materials and methods  1 \n2.1 Materials  2 \nNon-labeled 2,4-DCP was supplied by ACROS Organics, UK, and 14C-2,4-DCP in 3 \ntoluene was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, UK. Limonene and \u03b1-pinene were obtained 4 \nfrom Fisher Scientific, UK. Goldstar, multipurpose liquid scintillation cocktail was 5 \nsupplied by Meridan. Sodium hydroxide used for the CO2 traps and chemicals for the 6 \nminimum basal salts solution were supplied by BDH Laboratory Supplies.  7 \n 8 \n2.2 Soil sampling and preparation 9 \nSoil samples of ca. 3 kg were collected from sites located under three vegetation 10 \ntypes; pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus robur) and mixed turf grass. Quercus robur 11 \nand Pinus sylvestris are isoprene- and monoterpene-emitting vegetation types (Stewart 12 \net al., 2003), respectively, and grass is a non-volatile isoprenoid-emitting vegetation. 13 \nWoodland soils were collected from Lancaster University Campus, Lancashire, U.K. 14 \nand grassland soil from Mycercough College, Garstang, Lancashire, UK. Soil was 15 \nhomogenized by sieving (2 mm) to remove stones and root material and stored at 4oC in 16 \nthe dark for no more than a month prior to commencement of the experimental work. 17 \n 18 \n2.3 Soil Characteristics  19 \nSoil pH and moisture content were determined using standard techniques.  The 20 \norganic matter content was determined by an acid hydrolysis followed by combustion at 21 \n450 \u00baC for 4 h and by a Carbo Erla 1108 Elemental Analyser . Phosphate and potassium 22 \ncontent were determined by acid digestion with HNO3. Phosphate reducing agent 23 \n(neutralised with NaOH) was used to develop the characteristic blue colour for 24 \nspectrometric determination at 882 nm (Cecil Ce 1011 UV spectrometer). Potassium 25 \n  \n6 \nwas determined directly using a Sherwood 410 Flame Photometer calibrated against the 1 \nhighest concentration (20 mg l-1) standard solution. 2 \n 3 \n2.4 Soil Spiking  4 \nSoils were spiked with non-labeled 2,4-DCP dissolved in acetone (20 ml) as the 5 \ncarrier solvent giving a final concentration in soil of 10 mg kg-1 at field moisture content 6 \n(30-40%). A stainless steel spoon was used to blend the soils and 2,4-DCP spike to give 7 \na homogenous distribution (Doick et al., 2003). Soils were subject to three different 8 \npreparations: (1) \u201cFreshly spiked\u201d soils were spiked with 2,4-DCP and amended with 9 \nthe isoprenoid compounds at five concentrations varying in order of magnitude (0.1, 1, 10 \n10, 100, 1000 \u00b5g kg-1) and degradation monitored immediately; (2) \u201c2,4-DCP aged\u201d 11 \nsoils were spiked with 2,4-DCP and stored in amber glass jars in darkness at room 12 \ntemperature for 32 d before amendment with isoprenoid compounds at the start of the 13 \nmineralisation assay; (3) \u201cIsoprenoid and 2,4-DCP aged\u201d soils were spiked with both 14 \n2,4-DCP and isoprenoid compounds and stored in amber glass jars in darkness at room 15 \ntemperature for 32 d before starting the mineralisation assay. For each of the three 16 \npreparations \u201cnon-amended\u201d soils were spiked with 2,4-DCP (dissolved in acetone) 17 \nwithout isoprenoid amendment and monitored as a control. Each treatment was 18 \nperformed in triplicate. 19 \n 20 \n2.5 Respirometry 21 \nThe effects of exposure time and isoprenoid amendment on the rate and extent of 22 \nmineralisation of 2,4-DCP was determined by measuring 14CO2 production using 23 \nrespirometric assays (Reid et al., 2001). Soil samples (10 g), 30 ml minimal basal salts 24 \nsolution, and 12C\/14C-2,4-DCP were added to each respirometric flask, to achieve a 14C-25 \nactivity of approximately ~80 Bq 14C-2,4-DCP g-1 soil and concentration\/mass of 10 mg 26 \n  \n7 \nkg-1. A CO2 trap, consisting of a 7 ml scintillation vial containing 1 ml NaOH (1 M) 1 \nsolution, was suspended from the lid of each respirometer to trap 14CO2 evolved as a 2 \nresult of 14C-2,4-DCP mineralisation. Respirometers were placed securely in an orbital 3 \nincubator (SANYO\u00ae Gallenkamp orbital incubator) at 20 oC and shaken at 100 rpm to 4 \nagitate and ensure adequate mixing of the slurry over the period of sampling. The 14C-5 \nactivity in the 14CO2 traps was assessed at regular intervals by replacing the NaOH traps 6 \nand adding scintillation fluid (5 ml) to each spent 14CO2 trap. After storage in darkness 7 \novernight, trapped 14C activity was quantified using a Packard Canberra, Tri-Carb\u00ae 8 \n2300TR liquid scintillation counter. An analytical blank (containing no 14C 2,4-DCP) 9 \ndetermined the level of background radioactivity. A blank, (autoclaved control) was 10 \nused to estimate 2,4-DCP lost through volatilization. Maximum mineralisation rates 11 \nwere calculated from the steepest part of the 14CO2 respirometric curve and presented as 12 \n% 14CO2 d-1; total extents of mineralisation are defined as cumulative mineralization 13 \n(%) at the end of the respirometric incubation; and lag time is defined as the time taken 14 \nto achieve 5% of 14CO2 evolution. 15 \n 16 \n 17 \n2.6 Statistical Analysis 18 \nSigma Stat\u00ae Version 2.03 and Sigma Plot\u00ae 2000 software packages were used to 19 \nanalyze data. To compare the extents, rates and lag times of 14C-2,4-DCP 20 \nmineralisation, two and three way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. Data 21 \nwere ln transformed in some cases to achieve equal variance. Tukey multiple 22 \ncomparisons test were used to identify treatments with significant differences.  23 \n 24 \n3. Results  25 \n  \n8 \n3.1. Mineralisation of 14C-2,4-DCP in freshly spiked soils  1 \nThe ability of indigenous soil microflora to mineralise 14C-2,4-DCP was measured 2 \nin freshly 2,4-DCP spiked soils, sampled from sites under pine, oak and grassland 3 \n(Figure 1). Up to 40 % of the freshly applied 14C-2,4-DCP was mineralised during the 4 \n17 d incubation period in the soils freshly spiked with isoprenoid compounds. Less than 5 \n7% of 14CO2 release was lost by volatilization (Table 2). There were significant 6 \ndifferences in lag times between each of the soil types (>2 d in the pine and the oak 7 \nsoils, <1 d in the grassland soils; P<0.05; Table 2). Overall, isoprenoid amendment did 8 \nnot affect lag times (P>0.05). However, within the limonene amended soils, there was a 9 \nsignificant isoprenoid concentration effect with 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 amendments, 10 \nresulting in significantly shorter lag times than the control and the 1 \u00b5g kg-1 limonene 11 \namendment (P<0.05). 12 \n 13 \nMineralisation rates varied from 2.5 % 14CO2 d-1 to 13.9 14CO2 % d-1 (Table 2). 14 \nMineralisation rates in the grassland soil were significantly greater than in the oak and 15 \nthe pine woodland soils (P< 0.001). There were no overall significant effects of 16 \nisoprenoid amendment on the rates of mineralisation (P>0.05). However, limonene 17 \nconcentrations of 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 in the grassland soil resulted in significantly 18 \nhigher mineralisation rates than in the control soils, and in the soils amended with 0.1 or 19 \n1 \u00b5g kg -1 (P<0.05). Mineralisation rates in the soils with limonene amendment of 1000 20 \n\u00b5g kg-1 also differed significantly from the 10 \u00b5g kg-1amendment (P<0.05). No 21 \nenhancement of mineralisation rates were observed in soils with \u03b1-pinene amendments 22 \n(P>0.05). 23 \n 24 \nThere was an overall significant difference in the extent of mineralisation between 25 \neach soil type (P<0.001). There were no differences in extents between the limonene 26 \n  \n9 \nand the \u03b1-pinene amended pine soils, nor between the limonene and the \u03b1-pinene 1 \namended oak soils. However, in the grassland soil, \u03b1-pinene amendment resulted in 2 \nhigher extents of mineralisation than in the limonene amendment (P<0.05). Amendment 3 \nwith \u03b1-pinene resulted in higher extents of mineralisation in the pine soil than in the oak 4 \nsoil (Tables 2, 3; P<0.05). The extents of mineralisation in the control (no amendment) 5 \ntreatment were significantly lower than for the 100 \u00b5g kg-1 limonene-amended soil 6 \n(P<0.05) and lower (but not significantly) than the 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 amendment (P=0.07).   7 \n 8 \n3.2. Mineralisation of 14C-2,4-DCP in aged soils 9 \nThe capacity of the indigenous soil microflora to mineralise 14C-2,4-DCP was 10 \nmeasured in the woodland and grassland soils following a 32 d incubation in the 11 \npresence of 2,4-DCP (Figure 2). Up to 61% mineralisation occurred in 2,4-DCP aged 12 \nsoils over the 17 d incubation period, with <7% of 14CO2 release by volatilization (Table 13 \n3). Lag times were less than one day for all except the \u03b1-pinene amended oak and 14 \ngrassland soils, where lag times were >1 d, and up to 3 d (Table 3). There were 15 \nsignificant differences in lag times between soil types (P<0.05), but there was no overall 16 \nsignificant influence of isoprenoid amendment (P>0.05). Lag times in the oak soil were 17 \nsignificantly greater than lag times in the pine and the grassland soils amended with 18 \nlimonene (P<0.05). In the \u03b1-pinene amended soils, lag times in all of the soil types were 19 \nsignificantly different from each other (P<0.05), with shortest lag times in the pine soil 20 \nand longest in the grassland soil.  21 \n 22 \nMineralisation rates for 2,4-DCP in aged soils ranged from 4.1 % 14CO2 d-1 to 45.3 23 \n% 14CO2 d-1 (Table 3). In a given soil, there were large differences in mineralisation 24 \nrates between isoprenoid types, but no overall significant effect of isoprenoid 25 \namendments on the mineralisation rates (P>0.05). Mineralisation rates were 26 \n  \n10 \nsignificantly different between each of the soil types (P<0.05), with the highest rates in 1 \nthe pine soil and the lowest in the oak soil.  2 \n 3 \nOverall, isoprenoid amendment did not have a significant influence on the extents 4 \nof mineralisation (P>0.05). However, there was a significant difference in the extents of 5 \nmineralisation between each soil type (P<0.05). Within both limonene- and \u03b1-pinene- 6 \namended soils, the pine soil exhibited the greatest extents of mineralisation. In limonene 7 \namended soils, there was a significant influence of isoprenoid amendment (P<0.05) in 8 \npine soil, with the 0.1 and 1 \u00b5g kg-1 amendment having a significantly greater extent of 9 \nmineralisation than all other concentrations of limonene amendments and the control 10 \ntreatment. However, no effect of isoprenoid amendment was observed in the \u03b1-pinene 11 \namended soils (P>0.05). 12 \n 13 \n3.3. Mineralisation of 2,4-DCP in soils aged with both limonene and 2,4-DCP 14 \nThe capacity of the indigenous soil microflora to mineralise 14C-2,4-DCP was 15 \nmeasured in the woodland and grassland soils following a 32 d incubation in the 16 \npresence of limonene and 2,4-DCP (Figure 3). Over the incubation period of 9 d, up to 17 \n71% mineralisation was achieved in soils aged with 2,4-DCP and limonene, with <6% 18 \nof 14CO2 released due to volatilization (Table 4). Lag times were <1 d for the majority 19 \nof treatments in the limonene and 2,4-DCP aged soils (Table 4). Isoprenoid 20 \nconcentration had a significant effect on lag times. Lag times in incubation with no 21 \nlimonene and the 0.1 mg kg-1 limonene amended soils were similar (P>0.05), but 22 \nsignificantly longer than lag times in the soils with 1, 10, 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 23 \nlimonene amendments (P<0.05). Lag times in soils with 1, 10, 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 24 \nlimonene amendments were also similar (P>0.05). Lag times also differed significantly 25 \n  \n11 \nbetween soil types (P<0.05); the pine and the grassland soils had similar lag times, 1 \nwhich were shorter than those in the oak soil.   2 \n 3 \nOverall, there was a significant isoprenoid amendment effect on mineralisation 4 \nrates (P<0.05). The mineralisation rates for the control treatment and the 0.1 \u00b5g kg-1 5 \namendment were not statistically different (P>0.05), but these rates were slower than 6 \nthose resulting from 1, 10, 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 amendments (P<0.05). The 7 \nmineralisation rates in soils amended with 1, 10, 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 limonene were 8 \nsimilar (P>0.05).  9 \n 10 \nGenerally, increasing limonene concentration enhanced the extents of 11 \nmineralisation of 14C-2,4-DCP (P<0.05; Figure 4). For the limonene amendment of 10 12 \n\u00b5g kg-1 in the pine soil and 100 \u00b5g kg-1 in the grassland soil, the extents of 13 \nmineralisation were relatively low and did not follow the general trend. The absence of 14 \nlimonene (control) resulted in a significantly lower extent of mineralisation than all the 15 \nlimonene amendments (P<0.05). The 0.1 \u00b5g kg-1 limonene amendment resulted in a 16 \nmineralisation extent similar to the no-addition of limonene treatment (P=0.52), but this 17 \nwas significantly lower than extents resulting from all the other limonene amendments 18 \n(P<0.01). The 1, 10, 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 amendments had similarly high extents of 19 \nmineralisation (P>0.05). There was also a significant difference between soil types 20 \n(P<0.05); extents of mineralisation in the oak and the grassland soils were similar, and 21 \nsignificantly lower (P<0.05) than in the pine soil.  22 \n 23 \n  \n12 \n4. Discussion 1 \n4.1. Adaptation of soils to 14C-2,4-DCP mineralisation. 2 \nIn the freshly spiked soils, between 22 and 39% mineralisation occurred after 17 d 3 \nincubation, which agrees with previous studies. For example, Rhodes et al. (2007) 4 \nreported 19% of 14C-2,4-DCP released as 14CO2 after 14 d (in soils spiked with 10 mg 5 \nkg-1 2,4-DCP). Further, Boucard et al. (2005) found 23% 2,4-DCP was mineralized after 6 \n20 d (total concentration 1.4 mg kg-1) and Shaw and Burns (1998) found that 25% 14C-7 \nactivity was mineralized after 21 d (total concentration 20 mg kg-1). Mineralisation in 8 \nfreshly contaminated soils indicates that soils have the potential for 2,4-DCP 9 \ncatabolism, thus 2,4-DCP degraders were already present in the indigenous microbial 10 \ncommunity to permit immediate utilization of 2,4-DCP (Shaw and Burns, 1998; 11 \nBoucard et al., 2005). It has been shown that biodegradation of 2,4-DCP is feasible in 12 \npreviously uncontaminated soils, due to the presence in many soil microorganisms 13 \nhaving the tfdB gene that encodes 2, 4-DCP hydroxylase (Vallaeys et al., 1996).  14 \n 15 \nIn the soils, spiked and aged with either 2,4-DCP alone, or with limonene, the 16 \ncatabolic activity of the indigenous microflora increases with contact time. Overall, 2,4-17 \nDCP aged soils exhibited greater extents and rates of 142,4-DCP mineralisation, with 18 \ndegradation of up to 60% and rates of between 4.14 and 45.34 % d-1. This contrasts with 19 \nthe maximum 39% extent of mineralisation and rates between 2.45 and 13.95 % d-1 for 20 \n142,4-DCP degradation in soils freshly spiked with 2,4-DCP. This has been observed for 21 \nother organic contaminants in soil, particularly that of PAHs (Hwang and Cutright, 22 \n2002; Macleod and Semple, 2002; 2006; Reid et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003). Macleod 23 \nand Semple (2002) suggested that the process of increasing degradation ability 24 \n(adaptation) could be via (1) induction of specific enzymes; (2) genetic changes 25 \nresulting in increased metabolic capabilities; or (3) the selective enrichment for 26 \n  \n13 \norganisms with the metabolic capability to transform the target contaminant or a 1 \ncombination of these mechanisms.   2 \n 3 \nThe properties of the sigmoidal mineralisation curves of the inoculated 142,4-DCP 4 \nobserved in soils freshly spiked with 2,4-DCP show that a period of microbial growth 5 \n(acclimation or lag phase) is required before significant mineralisation rates occur 6 \n(e.g.Grosser et al., 1991). After 32 d, most soils\u2019 mineralisation curves for inoculated 7 \n142,4-DCP had shorter lag times and earlier onset of rapid rates of mineralisation 8 \ncompared with freshly spiked soils. This indicates that 32 d was sufficient for adaptation 9 \nand enrichment in the soils of microbial populations with 2,4-DCP degradative ability. 10 \n 11 \nIn contrast, similar mineralisation processes lasted >24 and \u2264 76 weeks in pyrene-12 \ncontaminated pasture soil, and were not completed at all in woodland soils 13 \ncontaminated with pyrene even after 90 weeks of pre-exposure (Macleod and Semple, 14 \n2002). This highlights the rapidity of the development of 2,4-DCP catabolic activity in 15 \nthe soils used in the present study. Clearly the physico-chemical properties of the 16 \nmolecules and their interactions with the soil will be important contributing factors, 17 \nwith pyrene being a more complex and less water soluble molecule than the 18 \nchlorophenol.  19 \n 20 \n4.2. The effect of isoprenoid and isoprenoid concentration on 14C-2,4-DCP 21 \nmineralisation in soil 22 \nThe overall insignificant differences between isoprenoid amendments and the no-23 \naddition of isoprenoid treatment in the freshly spiked soils are comparable with the 24 \nfindings of Rhodes et al. (2007). In this study, Rhodes et al. (2007) found that soils 25 \nfreshly spiked with 2,4-DCP and amended with \u03b1-pinene, or an isoprenoid mixture 26 \n  \n14 \ncontaining limonene, showed no enhanced 2,4-DCP mineralisation relative to the no-1 \naddition of isoprenoid control. In this current study, it was found that soils aged with 2 \n2,4-DCP then amended with isoprenoid at the start of the mineralisation assay also 3 \nshowed an insignificant difference in biodegradation between isoprenoid amendments 4 \nand the no-addition of isoprenoid control. These combined results suggest that 2,4-DCP 5 \ncatabolic activity is not significantly influenced by the presence of isoprenoids. It 6 \nappears that the period of contact time with 2,4-DCP is more critical than the isoprenoid 7 \nconcentration applied; however, although not significant, within limonene amended 8 \nfreshly spiked soils, the 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 amendments resulted in a greater extent 9 \nof mineralisation and shorter lag times than the no-addition of limonene control in the 10 \noak and the pine soils. In the grassland soil, freshly amended with limonene, greater 11 \nrates of mineralisation were also observed in the 100 and 1000 \u00b5g kg-1 amendments. 12 \nThe greater extents, shorter lag times and faster rates observed for grass soils amended 13 \nwith higher concentrations of limonene implied that there may have been a stimulatory 14 \neffect on the microbial 2,4-DCP catabolic activity above a minimum concentration.   15 \n 16 \nMacleod et al. (2002) suggest that higher concentrations of contaminant during 17 \nprior exposure result in greater catabolic potential; therefore, a greater concentration of 18 \nco-substrate might result in greater catabolic potential. The results presented in this 19 \nstudy support this hypothesis, but also indicate that the enhancing effect diminishes at 20 \nhigher concentrations. There is a rapid rate of increase in the extent of mineralisation 21 \nwith increasing limonene concentration, followed by a diminishing rate of increase in 22 \nmineralisation extent at high concentrations of limonene (\u2265 1 \u00b5g kg-1). This suggests 23 \nthat there might be both co-substrate and substrate (contaminant) concentration 24 \nthresholds, below which catabolic activity is not maximized (Macleod and Semple, 25 \n2003). However, Tandlich et al. (2003) did not report the existence of a concentration 26 \n  \n15 \neffect, suggesting that biodegradation of PCBs was independent of the concentration of 1 \nco-substrate (10 and 20 mg l-1). However, it is possible that the concentrations of co-2 \nsubstrate applied were high enough that the enhancing effect of co-substrate 3 \nconcentration had stabilized and so there appeared to be no benefit in applying higher 4 \nconcentrations of co-substrate. Alternatively, the concentration independence might 5 \nhave been a function of the reduced bioavailability of PCB molecules.  6 \n 7 \n14C-2,4-DCP mineralisation rate was lowest in grassland soils. This may be 8 \nexplained by the fact that grass is a non-monoterpene emitting vegetation. If grass roots 9 \ndo not emit monoterpenes, then the soil microflora may not be enriched with species 10 \npossessing the enzymes to degrade these compounds which are structural analogues of 11 \n2,4-DCP. Deciduous oak trees emit isoprene rather than monoterpenes (Possell et al., 12 \n2004), and mineralisation rates in the oak soil were statistically similar to those in the 13 \ngrassland soils. In contrast, pine trees are monoterpene emitters (Janson, 1993), and 14 \nmineralisation rates in the pine soils were higher. Hence, natural exposure of the pine 15 \nwoodland microbial communities to monoterpenes, which are structurally similar 16 \n(natural analogue) to 2,4-DCP, appears to confer a greater inherent ability to adapt to 17 \nthe presence of 2,4-DCP. Natural exposure of pine soils to monoterpenes from roots and 18 \nlitter may also result in a larger and\/or more active community of 2,4-DCP degrading 19 \nmicroorganisms, and is an example of how different plant communities could influence 20 \nthe microflora in the rhizosphere. 21 \n 22 \n4.3. Influence of soil characteristics on 14C-2,4-DCP mineralisation 23 \nSoil organic matter (SOM) content differed significantly between the different soil 24 \ntypes, with the greatest SOM content in woodland soils (48% in pine and 17% in oak). 25 \nSorption of 2,4-DCP is strongly correlated to SOM content, with increased sorption at 26 \n  \n16 \ngreater SOM contents (Benoit et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2004). It has recently been 1 \nproposed that in soils with high SOM content, the rate of transfer of contaminants from 2 \nsolid to aqueous soil phases and hence to microorganism limits mineralisation (Macleod 3 \nand Semple, 2002). However, in this present study, mineralisation was greatest in soils 4 \nthat contained the highest SOM content; this supported the findings Benoit et al (1999). 5 \nA possible explanation for the greater mineralisation in soils with higher SOM content 6 \nmay be that SOM provides a source of energy and a reservoir of nutrients for the 7 \nindigenous soil microflora. Low SOM frequently limits the growth of microbes, thus the 8 \nstimulatory effects of SOM content on microbial biomass might override the possible 9 \nreduced biodegradation rates as a consequence of high SOM to give a greater overall 10 \nextent of 2,4-DCP mineralisation in woodland soils. Further, it has been reported that 11 \nthe presence of organic matter does not significantly affect the biodegradation of 12 \nmonoterpenes (Misra et al., 1996). 13 \n 14 \nAll soils were acidic, reflecting their high organic matter content. The woodland 15 \nsoils had significantly lower pH than the grassland soil (pH 3.7 \u00b1 0.02 and pH 3.9 \u00b1 16 \n0.03, for pine and oak, respectively; pH 5.1 \u00b1 0.06 for grass). Acidity affects the 17 \nefficacy of some chlorinated pesticides (e.g. chlorophenols) which become less mobile 18 \nin acidic soils (Jensen, 1996). This may also have contributed to mineralisation rates of 19 \n14C-2,4-DCP in the different soils.  20 \n 21 \n4. Conclusions 22 \nSoil-contaminant contact time is a critical factor affecting the development of catabolic 23 \nactivity within indigenous soil microflora. Isoprenoid amendment has an enhancing 24 \neffect only when sufficient time has elapsed for microbial adaptation. Following 25 \nadaptation, increasing isoprenoid concentrations enhanced biodegradation, with the 26 \n  \n17 \nenhancing effect diminishing at higher concentrations. Degradation was greatest in 2,4-1 \nDCP and limonene aged soils. Overall, this study supports the suggestion that 2 \namendment of soils with monoterpenes induces organic contaminant degradation by 3 \nindigenous soil microflora. Therefore, it is feasible to suggest that there is potential for 4 \nin-situ remediation of contaminated soils through the stimulation of indigenous 5 \nmicroorganisms through applications of exogenous isoprenoid such as terpene rich plant 6 \nresidues or the planting of isoprenoid emitting vegetation. 7 \n 8 \nAcknowledgements 9 \nThe authors acknowledge the advice and assistance in the laboratory of Kieron Diock, 10 \nNadia Dew and Jackie Stroud.
