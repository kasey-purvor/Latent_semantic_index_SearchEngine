Clausen\n(lbnc1@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nSince ground-based magnetometers were deployed in many\nregions of the world it is well known that ultra-low frequency\n(ULF) waves are a ubiquitous feature of the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere. As the plasma inside the magnetosphere and indeed\nthe entire solar system is mostly collisionless, they act as the\nprimary agent to transfer mass and energy through the entire\nsystem.\nPulsations on the ground were grouped according to their\ncontinuous or irregular appearance and their frequency (Ja-\ncobs et al., 1964). Whereas the irregular pulsations (termed\n\u201cPi\u201d) are often connected to the substorm phenomenon (Ros-\ntoker et al., 1980), the continuous branch was found to relate\nto drivers outside the magnetosphere (Takahashi, 1998).\nRegular oscillations were termed \u201cPc\u201d pulsations. One\nspecial group of regular pulsations was first interpreted\nas standing Alfve\u00b4nic waves on geomagnetic field lines by\nDungey (1954). These pulsations are known as field line res-\nonances (FLRs). If measurements of the FLR are available\nover a range of latitudes, profiles of the signal power at the\nFLR frequency and the signal\u2019s phase can be compiled. In\nthese profiles FLRs are easily identified as resonant features\nif the power profile shows an about 1\u25e6 wide peak at one lati-\ntude, and the phase profile exhibits a 180\u25e6 phase shift across\nthat resonant latitude (Walker et al., 1979). Generally, the\nphase propagation is poleward.\nGlobal characteristics like polarization and occurrence dis-\ntributions of FLRs were first described in detail by Samson\net al. (1971) and Samson and Rostoker (1972). Shortly af-\nter this, Southwood (1974) and Chen and Hasegawa (1974)\nwere able to explain these characteristics by showing that\ncompressional magnetic waves originating from the magne-\ntopause can couple to Alfve\u00b4nic waves on closed geomag-\nnetic field lines. They proposed that the compressional\nwaves were generated by surface wave activity originating\nat the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) at both flanks of\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n3238 L. B. N. Clausen and T. K. Yeoman: Comprehensive survey of ULF band spectral content\nthe magnetosphere which thus acts as the primary driver for\nFLRs.\nIn the model for the generation of FLRs by Southwood\n(1974) and Chen and Hasegawa (1974), propagating com-\npressional waves in the near-Earth environment can couple\nto Alfve\u00b4nic waves on closed magnetic field lines. As each\nfield line has its own set of eigenfrequencies depending on\nits length and the mass distribution along that field line, a\nbroad band input of compressional waves should produce a\nbroad band response in the Alfve\u00b4nic mode, each field line\n\u201cpicking\u201d its resonant frequencies from the broad band input.\nThis has been shown to be the case using spacecraft measure-\nments (Engebretson et al., 1986; Clausen et al., 2009). When\nlooking at ground-based data, however, FLRs rarely show a\nbroad band response.\nInstead, monochromatic pulsations were observed on the\nground. The frequencies of the pulsations proved to be sur-\nprisingly stable with FLRs sometimes resonating over hours\nwith the same frequency, independent of the latitude (i.e. the\nfield line length) at which they were observed.\nKivelson et al. (1984) offered a possible solution to this\ninconsistency. They proposed, based on observational evi-\ndence, that the magnetosphere can for compressional waves\nbe treated as a cavity, bounded by the magnetopause on one\nside. The other boundary is the frequency dependent posi-\ntion of a turning point of the compressional wave. Between\nthese boundaries a standing compressional wave would form.\nHowever, the inner boundary allows energy to leak out of the\ncavity. The evanescent wave can then, provided a closed field\nline with a matching eigenfrequency is in the vicinity, couple\nto an Alfve\u00b4nic wave on that field line, hence creating a FLR.\nNaturally, the cavity only supports a discrete set of eigenfre-\nquencies, hence explaining the absence of frequency spread-\ning in ground-based observations of FLRs. This model was\nsubsequently developed further by Kivelson and Southwood\n(1985) and Kivelson and Southwood (1986).\nThe cavity model explained the occurrence of stable fre-\nquencies which depended on the position of the two bound-\naries. Later however, several researchers reported not\nonly stable frequencies but a reoccurring stable set of fre-\nquencies. Using ground-based magnetometer and High-\nFrequency (HF) radar data, they found that FLRs tended to\noccur at frequencies of 1.3, 1.9, 2.6 and 3.4 mHz, largely in-\ndependent of the local time of the observation (Samson et al.,\n1991; Fenrich et al., 1995; Provan and Yeoman, 1997; Mathie\net al., 1999; Plaschke et al., 2009). This set of frequencies is\nknown as \u201cCMS frequencies\u201d \u2013 cavity mode model of Sam-\nson et al. (1991).\nUsing the cavity model by Kivelson and Southwood\n(1985), the predicted eigenfrequencies of the proposed\nglobal standing compressional modes were estimated to lie\nslightly above the CMS frequencies observed on the ground.\nThis inconsistency prompted Samson et al. (1992) to propose\nthat the magnetosphere has to be treated like a waveguide\nrather than a cavity, therefore allowing azimuthal propaga-\ntion of the global compressional modes. With this assump-\ntion they were able to quite accurately reproduced the ob-\nserved CMS frequencies.\nAs FLRs are observed in abundance on the ground, the\ncorresponding driving compressional modes should be ob-\nserved as often by satellites. This is, however, not the case\n(Waters et al., 2002). Convincing indirect evidence for the\nvalidity of the waveguide model was provided by Samson\net al. (1995), however at frequencies significantly higher than\nthe CMS frequencies.\nDespite the large body of work that has been done on re-\noccurring stable frequencies, the topic remains controversial.\nThe most obvious question is how the global mode frequen-\ncies can be so stable when the topology of the cavity is so de-\npendent on upstream conditions. The predicted frequencies\nof both the cavity and the waveguide model depend on the\nposition of the boundaries. Surely the stand-off distance of\nthe magnetopause changes quite significantly, hence chang-\ning the properties of the cavity\/waveguide. It it thus not ob-\nvious why the magnetosphere should still support the same\neigenfrequencies while its dimensions are so variable.\nThe mere preference of FLRs for the CMS frequencies is\ndisputable as well. Baker et al. (2003) analysed pulsation\nevents in ten years of CANOPUS ground-based magnetome-\nter data and while confirming all of the known characteris-\ntics of Pc5 wave activity like dawn\/dusk asymmetry, they\nfound no preference for any set of frequencies. On the other\nhand Mathie et al. (1999) found a clear preference for CMS\nfrequencies when analysing 137 pulsation events in IMAGE\nground-based magnetometer data. Mathie et al. (1999) how-\never only analysed pulsation events from the month March,\n\u201cas the equinoctial months have previously been found fruit-\nful for the observation of pulsation events\u201d. It may hence be\nthat the preference for CMS frequencies was masked in the\nstudy of Baker et al. (2003).\nSome researchers have suggested that compressional and\nAlfve\u00b4nic MHD oscillations embedded in the solar wind di-\nrectly drive FLRs in the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere (Prikryl et al.,\n1998). Eriksson et al. (2006) report a number of cases\nwith good correlation between pulsations observed in the so-\nlar wind and in HF radar data on the ground. They find\nthe best correlation occurs at frequencies between 0.8 and\n1.2 mHz. Stephenson and Walker (2002) even present evi-\ndence that pressure pulsations in the solar wind drive FLRs\non the ground at some of the CMS frequencies.\nA recent paper by Viall et al. (2009) summarises work that\nwas done on the occurrence of stable frequencies in ground-\nand space-based measurements. They also show that in about\nhalf the cases where a spectral peak was found in solar wind\ndata, the same frequency was statistically significant in a cor-\nresponding magnetospheric data segment. However, none of\nthe above cited works is able to explain why pulsations at a\ncertain frequency are more prominent in the solar wind.\nAnn.

The\ngrey areas give the FOVs of the Saskatoon (looking East) and Ka-\npuskasing (looking North) SuperDARN radar.\n2 Case studies\nIn this section we will present two case studies of the 132 in-\ntervals that form the statistical study. This aims to emphasise\nthe validity of our statistical results discussed later.\n2.1 24 October 2004\nBetween 12:00 and 14:00 UT on 24 October 2004 the Clus-\nter satellites were magnetically conjugate to the CARISMA\narray spread over Northern America. The satellite\u2019s perigee\nwas located on the dawn flank at 9.1 h MLT. The trace of\nthe footprint for s\/c 1 calculated for standard input parame-\nters (pdyn=2.0 nPa, Dst=0.0 nT, By=0.0 nT, Bz=0.0 nT) by\nthe T96 model (Tsyganenko, 1995) is shown in Fig. 1. Also\nshown are the positions of the CARISMA magnetometer\nstations and the fields-of-view (FOVs) of two SuperDARN\nradars located in Saskatoon (looking North-East) and Ka-\npuskasing (looking North-West).\nDuring the hours leading up to the event that will be dis-\ncussed here, the solar wind conditions were quiet. Between\n10:00 and 11:10 UT the ACE satellite measured a steady\nIMF around (8,\u22124,0) nT in GSM coordinates (see Fig. 2).\nA steady solar wind velocity at 450 km\/s combined with a\nparticle density of about 6 cm\u22123 lead to a dynamic pressure\nof 2.5 nPa. A simple time-of-flight analysis suggests that it\ntook the solar wind about 60 min to reach the Earth\u2019s magne-\ntopause.\nFig. 2. Overview of the solar wind parameters measured by the\nACE satellite.\nAfter 11:10 UT the conditions were slightly disturbed,\nmore specifically at 11:35 UT a short (\u223c1 min) magnetic dis-\nturbance together with an increase in dynamic pressure from\n2.5 to 3.0 nPa was observed by ACE. The IMF X compo-\nnent increased from 6 to 8 nT and the Y component shot up\nfrom \u22124 to \u22121 nT. The Z component dropped from 2 to\n\u22122 nT, leaving the IMF magnitude essentially unchanged at\n8 nT. This resulted in a clock angle change from \u221260\u25e6 to\n\u2212160\u25e6. The disturbance lasted for about one minute before\nthe IMF returned to its original orientation. Lagged by the\nsolar wind propagation time the disturbance is expected to\nhit the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere around 12:35 UT.\nIonospheric velocities measured at 1 min resolution by the\ntwo SuperDARN radars located in Saskatoon and Kapuskas-\ning are shown in the top two panels of Fig. 3. The data from\nSaskatoon\u2019s beam 10 and Kapuskasing\u2019s beam 5 are shown\nin the top and second panel, respectively. A pulsation was ob-\nserved by the Kapuskasing radar between range gate 15 and\n30 in all 16 beams of the radar (not shown) after 12:40 UT.\nIt was observed both in E-region scatter at lower range gates\nand F region scatter at higher range gates. Just after 12:40 UT\nit had a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 1000 m\/s which de-\ncreased over the cause of the event. Unfortunately, the data\nquality is poor, i.e. the data contains a lot of gaps. This makes\na Fourier analysis impossible, however from line plots of the\nvelocity the period of the pulsation can be estimated to be\nbetween 5 and 6 min.\nAlthough the data quality is bad, the velocities measured\nby the Kapuskasing radar suggest that the pulsation had a\npoleward phase propagation, as indicated by the slanted re-\ngions of maximum velocity.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3237\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3237\u20133248, 2009\n3240 L. B. N. Clausen and T. K. Yeoman: Comprehensive survey of ULF band spectral content\nThe same pulsation was observed in E region scatter by the\nSaskatoon radar between range gate 12 to 14. The data qual-\nity here is even worse then at Kapuskasing, however again\nthe period can be estimated to be around 5 min. The areas\nof the FOVs in which the pulsation was observed are marked\ndark grey in Fig. 1.\nMagnetic field measurements by s\/c 1 of Cluster for this\nevent are shown in panels three to five of Fig. 3. The mag-\nnetic field is shown in a coordinate system which is aligned\nalong the background magnetic field as predicted by the T96\nmodel.\nFor each magnetic field datum along the orbit of each\nsatellite the T96 model value gives the background magnetic\nfield direction F . The azimuthal direction component A is\ncalculated via A=F\u00d7r where r is the geocentric position\nvector of the satellite. Hence the azimuthal unit vector points\npositive East. The right hand system is completed by a radi-\nally inwards pointing componentR=F\u00d7A.\nThe advantage of a field-aligned coordinate system is that\nif a wave is observed, the component in which it is most\nprominent will indicate its mode (compressional, Alfve\u00b4nic\ntoroidal or Alfve\u00b4nic poloidal). The field aligned time series\nof the magnetic field will contain the compressional mode\nand the toroidal mode is contained within the azimuthal time\nseries. The poloidal mode will be within the radial direction.\nPanels 3, 4 and 5 in Fig. 3 show the radial (poloidal),\nazimuthal (toroidal) and field-aligned (compressional) mag-\nnetic field. The right panels show the respective Fourier pow-\ners. As a guide to the eye vertical dashed lines are plotted\nevery five minutes.\nThe oscillations of interest appear just after 12:35 UT in\nthe compressional component of the magnetic field (fifth\npanel in Fig. 3). They consist of two cycles and have a period\nof about five minutes (3.1 mHz). A pulsation with the same\nfrequency, however almost a factor of 4 larger, is observed\nin the poloidal component (third panel in Fig. 3). A pulsa-\ntion was also observed in the toroidal component but with a\nlonger period of about seven minutes (2.4 mHz).\nThe magnetic field measurements in the geographic North-\nSouth direction from ground-based magnetometers belong-\ning to the Churchill line of the CARISMA chain are shown\nin the bottom five panels of Fig. 3. The stations are sorted\nfrom highest (TALO) to lowest (PINA) latitude.\nAt the same time as in the compressional component of\ns\/c 1 all ground-based magnetometer observed a pulsation\nat 3.1 mHz. The latitude profile of the Fourier power and\nphase at 3.1 mHz of both the North-South (solid line) and\nEast-West (dashed line) component are shown in the left and\nright panel of Fig. 4, respectively. A maximum in amplitude\nof the North-South component is observed at the latitude of\nGILL, along with a 180\u25e6 phase shift. No peak is observed\nin the East-West data. The latitude profiles provide strong\nevidence that the observed pulsation was a FLR.\nFourier phases at 3.1 mHz along a longitudinal profile of\nground based magnetometers allow the determination of the\nazimuthal wave number m. Here we used the data from\nGILL, RABB and FSMI. Note that FSIM and DAWS (com-\npare Fig. 1) did not observed the pulsation. The average m\nnumber is 3.6, as would be expected for such a large scale,\nexternally driven event.\nBetween 12:10 and 12:35 another pulsation with a fre-\nquency of 1.7 mHz was observed by the ground-based mag-\nnetometers. Its latitude profile peaked in amplitude around\nESKI, accompanied by a roughly 180\u25e6 phase shift. The pro-\nfiles of the East-West component do not show this behaviour,\nagain identifying this pulsation as a FLR.\nNote that the pulsation at the lower frequency (1.7 mHz)\npeaked in amplitude at a higher latitude than that with a\nhigher frequency at 3.1 mHz. This behaviour is characteris-\ntic of the observation of pulsation events at CMS frequencies\n(Fenrich et al., 1995).\n2.1.1 Cluster power spectra\nThe power spectra of the Cluster magnetic field data pre-\nsented in Fig. 3 were calculated from the interval for which\nthe time series is shown (12:20 to 13:00 UT). Due to the rela-\ntively short interval length, the frequency resolution of these\nspectra was poor at 0.4 mHz.\nIn order to clearly link the case studies with the statistical\nanalysis presented in the second part of this paper, we already\ninclude here a discussion of how Cluster magnetic field data\nwere analysed to produce power spectra which will allow the\nstatistical evaluation of their frequency contents.\nCluster orbit data on 24 October 2004 were searched for\nthe time and position at which each satellite reached perigee.\nCentred at the time of perigee, the three components of the\nmagnetic field sampled by the four Cluster satellites were\nselected for an interval with a length of 2500 points. At\nspin resolution (4 s) this corresponds to an interval length of\n10 000 s.\nDuring this interval of about three hours length, each Clus-\nter satellite sampled the magnetic field between \u221240\u25e6 and\n+40\u25e6 magnetic latitude. Based on the assumption that the\nmagnetic field is dipolar, this corresponds to L values smaller\nthan 10RE . On 24 October 2004 the analysed 10 000 s inter-\nval stretched from 10:02 to 12:48 UT which, according to the\nfootprint prediction shown in Fig. 1, maps to latitudes below\n75\u25e6. It can hence be assumed with confidence that during the\nentire interval the satellites sampled the conditions on closed\nmagnetic field lines only.\nThe magnetic field data of the four satellites were con-\nverted into the T96 field-aligned coordinate system as de-\nscribed earlier. Subsequently, a linear trend was subtracted\nfrom each time series. Spectral powers p\u02c6(fi) were calcu-\nlated from the Hanning window tapered time series using a\nFFT. The interval was 10 000 s long, hence a frequency reso-\nlution of 0.1 mHz was achieved. An overall spectrum p(fi)\nwas then calculated as the mean of the spectral powers of the\nspacecraft in each frequency bin fi .\nAnn.

All data are\nfrom 24 October 2004.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3237\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 3237\u20133248, 2009\n3242 L. B. N. Clausen and T. K.

The profile of the North-South component is shown\nas solid lines, the dashed lines give the profiles for the East-West\ncomponent.\nBecause of the close separation of the Cluster satellites\nduring this event (smaller than 0.5RE), any \u201creal\u201d wave\nshould appear in data from all four satellites. Taking the av-\nerage in each frequency bin ensures that artefacts that were\nonly observed by one spacecraft are excluded as much as\npossible.\nTo identify peaks in each averaged spectrum, the noise\nlevel P \u2032 was determined between 0.8 and 15.8 mHz in a\nstraight forward way following Walker et al. (1979). First,\nthe average signal power P was determined from the power\nvalues p(fi) as\nP = (1\/n)\nn\u2211\ni=0\np(fi), (1)\nwhere n is the number of spectral values between 0.8 and\n15.8 mHz. An estimate for the noise level P \u2032 is then ob-\ntained by repeating this procedure omitting all points where\np(fi)>2P .\nA peak is then defined as a spectral power value that\n\u2013 is larger than the noise level estimate P \u2032;\n\u2013 is larger than at least one neighbouring point both to-\nwards higher and lower frequencies.\nFrom all peak values matching the above criteria, those\nwith the highest 20 amplitudes were selected, the others dis-\ncarded.\nTo obtain a more accurate estimate of the peak\u2019s position,\na parabola was fitted to the power value identified as peak\nand the two adjacent spectral values. The position of the\nmaximum of the fitted parabola was then taken as the peak\u2019s\nposition.\nFig. 5. Panel (a) shows the average spectrum of the compressional\nmagnetic field component for 24 October 2004 in double logarith-\nmic space. The dotted line shows the fitted 4th order polynomial.\nPanel (b) shows the same spectrum on a linear y-axis. Peaks found\nin the untreated spectra are marked by vertical dashed lines. See\ntext for further explanation.\nPanel (a) in Fig. 5 shows the averaged spectrum of the\ncompressional component for 24 October 2004 in double\nlogarithmic space. The same spectrum but with a linear y\naxis is shown in panel (b). Vertical dashed lines indicate lo-\ncations of peaks in the spectrum determined by the algorithm\ndescribed above. The noise level P \u2032 is shown as a horizontal\ndotted line in panel (b) of Fig. 5. Orange dash-dotted lines\nindicate the parabolas fitted to the peak positions.\nIn order to whiten the spectra and enhance real peaks, es-\npecially at higher frequencies, a 4th order polynomial was\nfitted in double logarithmic space to the average spectrum\nand subsequently subtracted from the spectral powers. The\ndashed line in panel (a) of Fig. 5 shows the polynomial fit.\nThe resulting detrended spectrum is shown in panel (c), in\nthe same format as panel (b) on a linear y-axis.\nFigure 5 clearly shows the difference in output when ap-\nplying the peak-finding procedure to the untreated i.e. unde-\ntrended spectrum shown in panel (b) and the treated one in\npanel (c).\nBetween 4 and 10 mHz no peaks were detected by the\ndescribed algorithm in the untreated spectrum, however the\ntreated spectrum clearly shows the existence and relevance\nof such peaks. Note that in both spectra peaks at 1.7 and\n3.1 mHz are detected, as would be expected as Cluster was\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3237\u20133248, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3237\/2009\/\nL. B. N.

Unlagged magnetic magnitude and particle data measured\nby the ACE satellite.\nclose to the region containing a compressional wave driving\nthe FLRs observed on the ground.\n2.2 12 November 2004\nThe pulsations that were observed on 12 November 2004\nwere most likely caused by a sudden increase in solar wind\npressure. Figure 6 shows the unlagged magnetic magnitude\nand particle data observed by the ACE satellite. The IMF\nwas steady around (6,\u22128,5) nT in GSM coordinates.\nDuring the two hour interval shown in Fig. 6 the solar\nwind speed was essentially constant at 585 km\/s. Before\n11:23 UT the solar wind pressure was constant and low at\nvalues around 0.5 nPa. After 11:23 UT the solar wind den-\nsity increased in two steps from 1 to 4 cm\u22123. Together with\na slight increase in solar wind flow speed, this caused a so-\nlar wind pressure increase by a factor of 5. Propagating the\npressure pulse at 585 km\/s predicts that the first smaller pres-\nsure increase hit the magnetopause about 50 min later, i.e.\n12:13 UT.\nDuring the time of the event, the Cluster satellites were,\naccording to the T96 model, again magnetically conjugate to\nthe CARISMA stations in Northern America. This is shown\nin geomagnetic coordinates in Fig. 7 using the same format\nas Fig. 1. The measurements of the ground- and space-based\ninstruments are shown in Fig. 8 in the same format as Fig. 3.\nThe magnetometers in Northern America observed a pul-\nsation starting around 12:10 UT, in very good agreement with\nthe predicted arrival time of the pressure pulse. Fourier spec-\ntra of the pulsation show that the pulsation consisted of two\nseparated pulsations, one had a frequency of 1.2 mHz, the\nFig. 7. Locations of the CARISMA magnetometers and the foot-\nprint of s\/c 1 in geomagnetic coordinates on 12 November 2004.\nother oscillated at 2.8 mHz. The lower frequency pulsation\nwas the larger one with amplitudes over 200 nT at RANK.\nThe pulsation was also observed by the four Cluster satel-\nlites. The unfiltered magnetic field data in the T96 field-\naligned system is shown in the top three panels of Fig. 8.\nThe variation causes the spectral peak at 1.2 mHz which can\nbe clearly observed in the spectra on the right. Although not\nimmediately obvious from the time series data, the Fourier\nspectrum of the compressional component reveals that wave\npower at the second frequency at 2.8 mHz was observed by\nthe satellites as well. The poloidal components of the mag-\nnetic field measured by Cluster shows some sign of the pul-\nsation near 1.2 mHz.\nLatitude profiles of the ground-based magnetometer data\nfor the two dominant frequencies are shown in Fig. 9. The\nlatitude profile at 1.2 mHz is shown in the top panel, that at\n2.8 mHz is shown in the bottom. Both show the character-\nistic peak at one latitude with a 180\u25e6 phase shift across that\nlatitude. As would be expected, the lower frequency peaked\nat higher latitudes, i.e. on longer field lines.\nApplying the same scheme as described in Sect. 2.1.1 to\nthe magnetic field data of the Cluster satellites during this\ninterval again extracts, among others, the two frequencies at\nwhich FLRs were observed on the ground.\nWe have presented two events where pulsation activity\nwas observed in the compressional component by the Clus-\nter satellites simultaneously to FLR activity on the ground.\nIt was shown that our algorithm detected peaks at the FLR\nfrequency in the spectra of the compressional magnetic field\ncomponent measured by Cluster.

Hence their\nrespective separation stayed essentially constant while they\nsampled the plasma conditions at all MLT. The maximum\nseparation at the perigee leg of the orbit was 0.8RE between\ns\/c 1 and s\/c 3, whereas s\/c 1 and s\/c 4 were only separated by\n0.1RE . The average distance between the spacecraft during\na typical orbit around perigee was 0.4RE .\nFor each of the 154 orbits between 1 June 2004 and 31\nMay 2005 the time and position at which each Cluster satel-\nlite crossed the perigee was determined. The three compo-\nnent time series of the four spacecraft were visually inspected\nFig. 10. The MLT position of the perigee and the minimum geo-\ncentric distance of all the Cluster passes analysed in this study. The\ncolour of each datum gives the month according to the colour bar\non the right.\nto spot obvious problems with the data. Unfortunately, all or-\nbits between 23:00 and 01:00 MLT had to be rejected due to\nlarge data gaps of the order of half an hour during the perigee\npass. These data gaps were caused by Cluster spending the\ntime around perigee in the shadow of the Earth, hence no\nsun-pulse was available to determine the correct spin rate,\nmaking the data calibration impossible. All in all, of the 154\npasses 20 were rejected for s\/c 1, 23 for s\/c 2, 22 for s\/c 3 and\n25 for s\/c 4. This inspection left 132 orbits for the statistical\nstudy.\nThe perigee positions and their respective times of the or-\nbits which were used in this study are shown in Fig. 10. The\ncolour of the points give the month in which the Cluster satel-\nlites completed the marked orbit and hence provide a relation\nbetween time and MLT. All orbits had closest approaches be-\ntween 4 and 5RE when projected into the X-Y GSM plane.\nCentred at the time of perigee, time series of the magnetic\nfield data of 10 000 s length were transformed into the T96\nfield-aligned coordinate system for all 132 orbits. Then, a\nFFT was calculated of each time series and the power values\nwere averaged in each frequency bin over the four satellites\nto generate a resulting spectrum p(fi). The spectrum was\nsubsequently whitened by subtracting a fitted 4th order poly-\nnomial.\nPeaks in each whitened spectrum were then identified us-\ning the criteria outlined in Sect. 2.1.1. We end up with a list\nof intervals, the MLT of the perigee during that interval and\na list of frequencies at which the overall spectrum showed\npeaks.\nIn the following section we will investigate whether our\ndata contains evidence that spectral peaks in the magnetic\nfield tend to occur preferentially at a certain set of frequen-\ncies, including the CMS frequencies.\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3237\/2009\/ Ann.

Subsequent panels show charac-\nteristics of significant peaks in occurrence distributions determined\nfrom different magnetic field models. See text for further details.\n3.2 Statistical results\nThe number of peaks in 0.2 mHz frequency bins detected in\neach of the three magnetic field components are shown in the\ntop panel of Fig. 11. The occurrence rates of the three com-\nponents have been offset in order to facilitate a comparison of\npeak positions in the three histograms. The CMS frequencies\nare marked by grey vertical dashed lines.\nIn Fig. 11 the dotted lines give a linear fit to the occur-\nrences in each component, the solid lines give the 95% confi-\ndence level of each fit. Any occurrence above the 95% confi-\ndence level is marked as a significant peak in the distribution.\nThe second panel in Fig. 11 shows the position of signif-\nicant peaks in the three data sets. The markers are scaled in\nthe y direction according to the level of each peak above the\n95% confidence line. The x direction is scaled according to\nthe width of the peak.\nWe find some indications that pulsations preferentially oc-\ncur at CMS frequencies in all three magnetic field compo-\nnents. However, none of the three data sets shows a prefer-\nence for all CMS frequencies. The preference is also not as\npronounced as was found in studies confirming the existence\nof CMS frequency preference (Samson et al., 1991; Fenrich\net al., 1995; Provan and Yeoman, 1997; Mathie et al., 1999;\nPlaschke et al., 2009).\nThe poloidal and toroidal data sets mostly show preferred\nfrequencies, i.e. peaks, at the same frequencies. The peaks in\nthe compressional component are found at somewhat differ-\nent locations.\nTo investigate the influence of the magnetic field model on\nthe peak occurrence, the same statistical study was repeated\nusing a dipolar magnetic field to predict the field-aligned di-\nrection. The resulting occurrence histogram is not shown,\nhowever the positions and amplitudes of the significant peaks\nin the distribution are shown in the third panel in Fig. 11. The\npositions and amplitudes of the significant peaks differ very\nlittle from those presented in the second panel. This is to be\nexpected as the Cluster satellites spend a large part of the or-\nbit around perigee in the inner magnetosphere where the T96\nmodel is essentially dipolar.\nWe repeated the analysis using an average over a variety of\nactual magnetic field measurements by the Cluster satellites\nto determine the background magnetic field direction. As for\nthe dipole magnetic field, the characteristics of the significant\npeaks found in the occurrence histograms are shown in the\nbottom three panels of Fig. 11.\nThe number of data points from which the average was\ncalculated to determine the background magnetic field di-\nrection were chosen to be 400 (27 min), 300 (20 min) and\n225 (15 min) and the results are shown in the fourth, fifth\nand sixth panel of Fig. 11, respectively. Again, evidence for\na preference of certain CMS frequencies is found, however\nwhich specific frequency is preferred depends on the average\nlength.\nWe find that the position of significant peaks below 5 mHz\nvaries considerably with the magnetic field model. Above\n5 mHz, however, we find consistent peaks independent of the\nmagnetic field model used. Specifically, we find peaks in\nthe poloidal component around 6.5, 8, 11.5 and 13.5 mHz.\nThe toroidal component shows reappearing peaks at 6.5, 8,\n11, 12.5 and 13 mHz. Consistent peaks in the compressional\ncomponent are found at 5.5, 7.5, and 15 mHz.\nWe hypothesise that a preference for the stated frequencies\nabove 5 mHz is caused by the same mechanism as was put\nforward to explain CMS frequencies. The harmonic series of\nthe cavity\/waveguide is being detected in the region close to\nwhere it drives FLRs. However, as will be discussed in the\nAnn. Geophys., 27, 3237\u20133248, 2009 www.ann-geophys.net\/27\/3237\/2009\/\nL. B. N. Clausen and T. K. Yeoman: Comprehensive survey of ULF band spectral content 3247\nnext section, the polar orbit of the Cluster spacecraft favours\nthe analysis of frequencies higher than the CMS frequencies.\nThe peak data provided by the scheme described in\nSect. 2.1.1 has also been binned in many categories that\nmight effect the distribution of peak occurrence. It is for ex-\nample well established that the solar wind conditions and the\nlocal time have a dominating influence on the observation of\nPc5 pulsations within the magnetosphere. Hence the results\nwere binned according to solar wind conditions and position\nof orbit in MLT, however the resulting histograms did not\nalter significantly from those presented in Fig. 11.\n3.3 A note on the Cluster orbit\nSome characteristics of a typical Cluster orbit are shown in\nFig. 12. The Cluster satellites typically sample magnetic field\nlines with L-values between 6 and 10 only at the beginning\nand end of each interval; the middle 60% of the interval they\nspend on field lines with L values smaller than 6RE .\nFLRs in the Pc5 frequency range, specifically at CMS fre-\nquencies, tend to occur at magnetic latitudes above 60\u25e6 on\nfield lines with L values between 6 and 10RE . In the cav-\nity\/waveguide model, the turning point of the driving com-\npressional wave lies at larger L values than the resonance\nregion. Toward smaller L values the compressional driver\ndecays exponentially. Hence the Cluster orbit is not ideal\nfor the study of cavity\/waveguide modes at CMS frequen-\ncies as it crosses the inner magnetosphere earthwards of the\nexpected turning point.\nWhen the satellites sample field lines having L values be-\ntween 6 and 10RE , i.e. on field lines which can support FLRs\nat CMS frequencies, they are generally located at magnetic\nlatitudes between 20 and 40\u25e6. Hence they are a significant\ndistance (3RE or so) away from the magnetic equatorial\nplane. The equatorial plane is the region where one would\nintuitively expect the cavity\/waveguide modes to form. This\npreference for the equatorial plane has been suggested by\nmodelling studies by Lee and Lysak (1989).\nHowever, the top panel of Plate 3 in Lee and Lysak\n(1989) shows the leakage of significant compressional power\nto magnetic latitude above 20\u25e6. Hence signatures of cav-\nity\/waveguide modes at CMS frequencies can be expected to\nbe observed by the Cluster satellites. Furthermore, the two\ncase studies presented here show that Cluster observed sig-\nnificant compressional wave power during FLR occurrences\neven though it was located inside the evanescent region of\nthe cavity\/waveguide mode.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have described two case studies during which ground-\nbased magnetometers and HF radars detected FLRs in the\nPc5 frequency range, specifically at CMS frequencies. A\ncareful analysis of power spectra compiled from an ex-\ntended 10 000 s interval during which the Cluster satellites\nFig. 12. Characteristics of a typical Cluster orbit. For 24 October\n2004 the L value (top panel), magnetic latitude (middle panel) and\ndistance from the magnetic equator (bottom panel) are shown.\nwere magnetically conjugate to the resonance region exhibits\npeaks at the FLR frequency in both cases. Most importantly,\npeaks at the FLR frequencies were found in the spectra of\nthe compressional component, indicating that signatures of\nthe cavity\/waveguide mode driving the FLR were picked up\nby Cluster during both events.\nFollowing on from the two case studies where compres-\nsional power in the Cluster magnetic field measurements\ncould be connected to FLR activity detected on the ground\nwe expanded the analysis of such 10 000 s intervals to one\nyear\u2019s worth of Cluster data. An algorithm was use to au-\ntomatically detect peaks in spectra of the compressional,\npoloidal and toroidal magnetic field component of 132 such\norbits between May 2004 and June 2005.\nWe presented histograms of the occurrence of spectral\npeaks in 0.2 mHz wide frequency bins between 1 and 15 mHz\nand peaks in the occurrence rate are identified. Although pre-\nvious studies have reported that FLRs occur with a stable re-\noccurring set of frequencies we find no consistent preference\nfor all CMS frequencies in our data.\nRepeating the statistical analysis using 5 different mag-\nnetic field models we again find no consistent preference for\nthe CMS frequencies. We do find, however, indications for\na preference of certain frequencies above 5 mHz, depending\non the magnetic field component. We hypothesise that the\nmechanism selecting these frequencies is the same waveg-\nuide\/cavity model as was put forward to explain the CMS\nfrequencies. However, in the inner magnetosphere, where\nCluster\u2019s perigee is located, we measure higher harmonics of\nthe cavity\/waveguide than the CMS frequencies.\nThe fact that no clear preference for pulsations occurring\nat CMS frequencies could be found in the presented data set\nmight be due to the spacecraft\u2019s orbit.
