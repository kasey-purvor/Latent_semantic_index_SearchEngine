The concept has directly influenced the workings of both the international \nUnited Nations Development Programme and the UK's domestic Equality and Human \nRights Commission. It is argued that it is essentially a liberal-individualist concept. \nDespite its attractions - which the article acknowledges - the 'capability approach' \nobscures or neglects three key realities: the constitutive nature of human \ninterdependency; the problematic nature of the public realm; and the exploitative nature \nof capitalism. The article argues for an emancipatory politics of needs interpretation that \nwould be better served by a discourse of rights than a discourse of capabilities. \n \nKey words:  exploitation; interdependency; needs; public realm; rights \n__________________________________________ \n \n \n \nThe 'elephant in the room' metaphor (which alludes to a problem so large and obvious \nthat everybody pretends not to notice it) is admittedly facile and overworked. But it is \nquite apt when it comes to reminding ourselves of certain key issues that remain \nperennially neglected by the increasingly influential concept of 'capabilities', as originally \ndeveloped by Amartya Sen (Sen, 1985, 1999, 2005). I want to suggest that there are (at \nleast) three elephants in what Sen has called 'the space of capabilities': three issues from \nwhich the beguiling notion of capabilities seems to distract attention. Despite its heuristic \nvalue, the foundations of the capabilities concept are essentially liberal. It therefore elides \nthe fundamental and inherent contradictions of capitalism. This article will briefly outline \nthe capabilities concept. It will explore its influence - for example, upon the thinking of \nthe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and, most recently, the UK's \nEquality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), before developing a critique that will \ntouch upon the way in which the concept and its supporters have ignored or attempted to \nsideline three key issues: the realities of human interdependency; the hegemonic liberal \nconception of the public realm; and the extent to which capitalism's global reach is \npredicated upon exploitative relations of power. The article concludes by arguing that the \n                                                 \n1 Hartley Dean teaches Social Policy at the London School of Economics. He is interested in people's \nexperiences of poverty, exclusion and welfare, and the ways in which human needs and social rights are \nsocially and ideologically constructed.

Sen's argument is that inequalities of income and \noutcome are less important than equality of fundamental freedoms. He has redefined \npoverty as an objective curtailment of a person's 'capabilities'; of her capacity and \nfreedom to choose and to act. Capabilities are not the same as abilities. The term refers \nnot simply to what people are able to do but to their freedom to lead the kind of lives they \nvalue, and have reason to value. \n Sen distinguishes between capabilities and: \n \n\u2022 On the one hand, commodities (that is, the goods, services or other resources to which \npeople have access) and the essential characteristics of those commodities (that is, the \nproperties which define their purpose or utility). \n\u2022 And on the other hand, functionings (that is, the full range of activities \u2013 including \nproductive, re-productive, caring, expressive and deliberative kinds of functioning \nthat human beings may achieve) and the subjective 'end states' (that is, the happiness \nor sense of well-being that are the final outcome of those functionings). \n \nCapabilities, therefore, represent the essential fulcrum between material resources and \nhuman achievements2. While poverty may be relative in the space of commodities, it is \nalways absolute in the sphere of capabilities. Sen's argument has been that equal inputs \ndo not necessarily give rise to equal outputs because human capabilities \u2013 the real \nfreedoms that people have to fashion their own way of living \u2013 may be objectively \nconstrained (cf. Held, 1994; Walzer, 1983). The substantive utility of particular \ncommodities and the well-being that results from particular kinds of functioning are \ndetermined or mediated by a host of socio-economic, cultural, historical, geographical \nand climatic factors. The principal advantages of the concept are twofold.  \n \n\u2022 First, it transcends the distinction between absolute and relative needs. The well-worn \ndistinction between absolute and relative concepts of poverty was famously debated \nbetween Sen and Peter Townsend in the 1980s (see Townsend, 1993 for a reprise) \n(and for a helpful overview Lister, 2004). While Sen claimed that Townsend's relative \napproach conflated poverty and inequality, Townsend claimed that Sen's insistence on \nidentifiying an 'absolutist core' of poverty perpetuated a narrow subsistence-standard \nconception of poverty. In truth neither claim stands up. Townsend was seeking \nobjectively to define the point at which 'relative' deprivation leads to a person's \ninability to participate in society. Sen was seeking to describe the circumstances in \n                                                 \n2 The author has advanced this definition elsewhere, albeit in a more specific context: see Dean, H., \nBonvin, J-M., Vielle, P. and Farvaque, N. (2005) 'Developing capabilities and rights in welfare-to-work \npolicies', European Societies, 7(1), 3-26. \n \n 2\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nwhich a person is 'absolutely' deprived of the ability to function (to do and to be) \nwithout shame. They both recognised the social nature of needs, but were adopting \ndifferent understandings of 'absolute' and 'relative'. It has been argued that the \ndistinction between absolute and relative needs reflects more complex distinctions \nthat may be drawn between inherent and interpreted notions of human need (e.g. \nDean, 2002). Psychological theories of need envisage that the human individual \npossesses a bundle of inherent needs, ranging from base pleasures to higher forms of \nself-fulfilment (Maslow, 1943; Ryan & Deci, 2001). Other commentators (e.g. \nBradshaw, 1972) regard human need as a matter of interpretation: its nature depends \nupon by whom, the criteria by which and the context in which it is defined. In \ncontrast, however, the capabilities approach provides a single all subsuming criterion \nof need: namely, whether a human being is substantively free to live as she would \nchoose.  \n\u2022 Second, it is an advance on Rawlsian concepts of social justice. Prior to the capability \napproach, Rawls' theory of social justice (1972) had offered the most progressive \napproach from within a liberal perspective, since it had sought to combine negative \nprinciples of liberty with meritocratic notions of equal opportunity and positive rights \nto 'primary goods': it was a theory, however, that expressly permitted social \ninequalities insofar as they could be justified in terms of the benefits they might \nbestow upon the least well endowed. The capabilities approach, by focusing on the \nsubstantive freedom of the individual to do or to be that which she values, is better \nable to accommodate the diversity of human beings and the complexity of their \ncircumstances (see Burchardt, 2006). \n \nCapability is at one level a neo-Aristotelian concept. It is an idea that, potentially, \ncaptures the notion of eudaimonic wellbeing and the 'good life' that is to be found in \nAristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics (see Macintyre, 2007). It is a \nconcept that transcends a narrow hedonic and utilitarian calculus in order to embrace the \nessential 'virtues' that, morally, define humanity. Yet capability remains a post-\nEnlightenment liberal concept. It is an idea within the tradition of Roosevelt's (1944) four \nfreedoms speech in which - amongst other things - he asserted that 'a necessitous man is \nnot a free man'.  The elusiveness of the concept has not been aided by Sen's own \nreluctance specifically to list or to prioritise what might constitute 'capabilities' (2005). \nUnsurprisingly, therefore, it is a concept whose influence has been extraordinarily \ndiverse. \n \n \nThe influence of the concept \n \nCertainly, the concept has been important within academic Social Policy, not least \nbecause it provided a direct influence on Doyal and Gough's theory of human need \n(1991). Doyal and Gough asserted that the most basic human needs are physical health \nand personal autonomy. Not only do we need to be healthy enough to survive, but we \nmust be able to make informed choices about our lives. Although these universal needs \nmay be satisfied in a variety of ways, it is possible to specify the needs satisfiers that are \noptimally necessary for human dignity. The concept has been even more explicitly \n 3\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nadapted and extended by Nussbaum (2000b) whose work has been influential within \nDevelopment Studies and who has been a central figure in the Human Development and \nCapability Association (see www.capabilityapproach.com). \n Amartya Sen himself has had some ostensible influence on the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, contributing to recent Human Development Reports. In the \n2000 report (UNDP 2000: ch. 1), for example, he presented his argument that the process \nof human development is the enhancement of human capabilities. However, it is argued \nelsewhere (Dean, 2002, 2008) that the international establishment never properly \nembraced his central premise. The prevailing establishment discourse \u2013 that is evident in \nother parts of the Human Development Report 2000 \u2013 assumes that human development \nand the reduction of poverty self-evidently require economic growth, not human \nempowerment. Poor countries, it is supposed, should avail themselves of the \nopportunities that capitalist globalisation can provide. In later chapters of the Human \nDevelopment Report 2000 the term 'human capital' is insinuated as if it were a synonym \nfor Sen's notion of 'human capabilities'. Sen, in fairness, has remarked upon the \nlimitations of the term human capital on the grounds that 'human beings are not merely \nmeans of production, but also the end of the exercise' (1999: 296). Though it may have an \napplication within critical sociological analysis (e.g. Bordieu, 1997), as a metaphor in \npolicy discourse the concept of human capital takes on a distinctly reductive economistic \nmeaning: individuals are constituted as actual or potential economic actors. Whether it \nrepresents a wilful corruption or a misunderstanding of the idea of human capabilities, the \nhuman capital approach continues to reflect essential elements of the economic and \npolitical orthodoxy once dubbed the 'Washington Consensus' (Williamson, 1990): a \nconsensus by which the ability of the poor to 'succeed' is construed too readily as a \nproperty or characteristic of individuals. Even within the context of the targets set by the \nMillennium Development Goals (UNDP 2003) the recipe for tackling world poverty still \nfavours the liberalisation of trade and financial markets, the privatisation and \nderegulation of economic production, flexible labour markets, low public spending and \ntaxation, and selective social 'safety nets'.  \n A very recent application of the capabilities approach has been witnessed in the \nUK. In October 2007 the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) was created, \nabsorbing into a single organisation the separate function of its three 'legacy \ncommissions', the Commission for Equal Opportunities (EOC), the Commission for \nRacial Equality (CRE) and the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). The EOC and the \nCRE had been created in the 1970s and the DRC in the 1990s with powers respectively to \npromote sex equality, 'race' equality and equality for disabled people and to investigate \ncomplaints of sexual and racial discrimination and discrimination against disabled \npeople. The new body additionally has powers in relation to the enforcement of equality \nlegislation relating to age, religion or belief, sexual orientation and transgender status and \nis charged with encouraging compliance both with the UK's Human Rights Act 1998 \n(which had, with effect from 2000, incorporated the provisions of the European \nConvention on Human Rights into domestic law) and with international human rights \nobligations more generally.  \n It is part of the EHRC's mission to develop 'an evidence-based understanding of \nthe causes and effects of inequality for people across Britain' \n(www.equalityhumanrights.com\/en\/aboutus\/mission). To prepare the EHRC for this \n 4\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nresponsibility the UK government had in 2005 established an independent Equalities \nReview, whose final report drew in its definition of 'an equal society' upon elements of a \ncapabilities approach: \n \nAn equal society protects and promotes equal, real freedom and substantive opportunity to \nlive in the ways people value and would choose, so that everyone can flourish. An equal \nsociety recognises people's different needs, situations and goals and removes the barriers \nthat limit what people can do and can be. (Equalities Review 2007: 6) \n \nThis definition was arrived at on the basis of evidence (Burchardt, 2006; Burchardt & \nVizard, 2007; Vizard & Burchardt, 2007) which explicitly recommended a capability \nmeasurement framework as a way of monitoring inequalities in the UK. The framework \nidentified and operationalised ten 'domains of valuable capabilities', derived from the \ninternational human rights framework. However, despite the potential breadth of its \nremit, the EHRC appears in practice to be primarily or expressly concerned with \ninequalities based on sex, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, religion and age. It is \nnot concerned with general and\/or social class inequalities and this clearly raises \nquestions as to whether this will constitute an adequate operationalisation of a capabilities \napproach. \n \n \nLimitations of the concept \n \nSupporters of a capabilities approach may struggle satisfactorily to implement it. But I \nam concerned in this article not so much with the ways in which it can be colonised, \ndistorted or subverted as with what may be the fundamental limitations of the capability \nconcept. It is not simply that it is possible for official national and international agencies \nto adopt the language of capabilities while studiously ignoring key drivers of inequality \nand poverty. For all its attractions, the concept is in itself constrained. The 'space of \ncapabilities' is abstracted from the 'space of commodities' and the 'space of functionings' \nin ways that necessarily constrain the critical purchase of the concept. If we consider the \nrevolutionary Enlightenment objectives of egalit\u00e9 (equality), libert\u00e9 (freedom), fraternit\u00e9 \n(solidarity), the capability approach to equality is framed in terms of freedom, but not \nsolidarity. It is a liberal-individualist approach and while ethical individualism need not \nimply methodological individualism (Burchardt, 2006) the priority is individual liberty, \nnot social solidarity; the freedom to choose, not the need to belong. In the space of \ncapabilities the individual is one step removed; she is objectively distanced from the \nrelations of power within which her identity and her life chances must be constituted. \nWithin the space of capabilities there are three major issues which the individual cannot \nreadily see and which are seldom clearly discussed. First and in any event, human beings \ncannot be free from their dependency upon other human beings. Second and third, under \ncapitalist social relations of production, individuals can be free neither from hegemonic \ncontrols over their participation in the public realm, nor from the direct or indirect \nconsequences of the exploitation of human labour. \n \nThe quotidian realities of human interdependency \n \n 5\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nHuman society is axiomatically to be understood as an association of interdependent \nbeings. And yet dependency in late-modern societies has become problematic (Dean & \nRodgers, 2004; Dean & Taylor-Gooby, 1992). There is a fetishistic tendency for people \nto condemn the dependency of others and to deny their own dependency; even when - \nparadoxically - they may celebrate their own dependability for loved ones, neighbours or \nfriends. The basis upon which we construe the nature of our membership of society (our \ncitizenship) and the claims that we have against each other (our rights and capabilities) is \npredominantly liberal or 'contractarian': it assumes the individual to be an autonomous \ncreature who survives by her bargaining with others (Dean, 2003; , 1999). The alternative \nbasis upon which to construe such things - though it remains for the most part eclipsed - \nis more republican in nature or 'solidaristic': it assumes the individual to be a vulnerable \ncreature who survives through her attachments to others (see also Turner, 1993; , 2006). \nThe social order can therefore be understood not just in terms of how it organises its \nmeans of production, but also in terms of how its members care for and about each other \n(Kittay et al, 2005; Parker, 1981). \n A similar reservation has been expressed by Deneulin and Stewart (2000), who \ncontend that social structures (or 'structures of living together') matter not only because \nthey may enable or constrain our capabilities, but because they are constitutive of our \nindividual identities and the frameworks of meaning by which we value various \nfunctionings. Social solidarity is not necessarily inimical to freedom, but a social being \ncannot wholly be free from others because the terms on which she belongs within a \nfamily, a community or a society will matter as much as her freedom to do or to be. \n In fairness to the supporters of the capability approach, the capabilities some seek \nto define and promote are by no means exclusively premised on the self-sufficient \nindividual subject. For example, Nussbaum's list of central human functional capabilities \nincludes 'affiliation', which encompasses 'being able to live with and towards others' \n(2000b: 79). The Equalities Review's dimensions of equality 'score card' includes \n'Individual, family and social life' (2007: 18). In each instance, the very legitimate \nconcern is with the integrity of the individual in the context of her relationships. In \nNussbaum's case she is clearly mindful of people's 'need for care in times of extreme \ndependency' (2000a: 48) so she seeks to recast liberalism to accommodate this; to move \nbeyond the Kantian division of the human individual's rational and animal selves and to \ninsist that being wholly dependent on another need not subserve one's moral personality. \nTo this end, she argues, the goal should be to provide 'affirmative support for all the \nrelevant capabilities'; to create 'a space' within which even the most impaired and \ndependent individual can 'exchange love and enjoy light and sound, free from \nconfinement and mockery' (2000a: 56 and 58). Thus in her list of central human \ncapabilities Nussbaum stipulates that a person should 'be able to imagine the situation of \nanother and have compassion for that situation' (2000b: 79). But it seems that both the \nperson and 'the other' are constituted as the abstract bearers of capabilities, not as what \nproponents of a feminist ethic of care would term a 'self-in-relationship' (Sevenhuijsen, \n2000: 10). From the perspective of the feminist ethic of care the question is 'How can I \nachieve some freedom, yet remain connected?' (Hirschmann, 1997: 170). To be capable \nof 'imagination' and 'compassion' for the situation of another implies disconnection as a \nstarting point, not a substantive connection. The person and 'the other' interact in a \nmetaphorical 'space of capabilities'. \n 6\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \n A care framework offers a quite different approach to that of a capabilities \nframework, being premised on a relational ontology. The individual can only exist \nthrough and with others within networks of care (Clement, 1998; Sevenhuijsen, 1998; \nTronto, 1994). The insight is not necessarily new since it resonates with the premises of \nUbuntu, the ancient pan-African philosophy (Ramose, 2003); and - importantly - it is not \nnecessarily sufficient when it comes to constructing the responsibilities we owe to \nstrangers, rather than intimates. Nonetheless it reminds us of the concrete substance of \nhuman lives in which everyday relationships can entail conflict, negotiation and struggle. \nThe ways in which we care for and about each other are, as often as not, socially \nnegotiated within such relationships, across the generations and over time (e.g. Finch & \nMason, 1993). While capability theorists seek to identify the components of a 'good life', \nAxel Honneth (1995) has suggested that the elements of what he calls an 'ethical life' \ninclude not only rights (which enable us to recognise the claims that others make upon \nus), but love (which enables us to recognise each other as needy creatures) and solidarity \n(which enables us to respect each other as creatures defined by difference). For Honneth, \nthe story of humankind is a struggle for recognition as much as for freedom. Human \nbeings must contend with their shared vulnerabilities as much as their quest for personal \nautonomy (cf. Turner, 2006). \n \nThe construction of the public realm \n \nThe aporia at the heart of the capability concept is the notion of the things to do and be \nthat the individual values and has reason to value. By implication, the individual must \nhave 'good' reason to value such things. But who is to determine what constitutes good \nreason? It is precisely because such judgements are necessarily contingent and relative \nthat Sen himself has been reluctant to engage in the listing of essential capabilities. It is \nimportant nonetheless to recognise that though Sen may have been the originator of the \ncapabilities approach, it is an approach that is now subject to an entire spectrum of \ninterpretations. There are those at another end of the spectrum who insist that by public \ndeliberative processes it is possible to determine what a list of central human capabilities \nshould look like. This is, in part, what Nussbaum (2000b), Alkire (2002) and Burchardt \nand Vizard (2007) have attempted. What is more, proponents of the capability approach \nwill include participation in public deliberation as a core capability. Nussbaum's list of \ncentral human functional capabilities includes 'Control over one's environment', which \nencompasses 'Being able to participate effectively in political choices that govern one's \nlife' (2000b: 80). The Equalities Review's dimensions of equality 'score card' includes \n'Participation, influence and voice' (2007: 18). And Sen himself has lately acknowledged \nthe role of 'public reasoning' in evolving definitions of capabilities (2005). \n But consensual agreements achieved in the process of public deliberation - \nwhether in the course of participative poverty assessments or through citizens' juries or \nfocus groups - may elide fundamental conflicts and hidden oppression. They may do \nnothing more than reflect prevailing hegemonic assumptions. What is more, the scope for \npublic reasoning is inhibited by the dominant liberal notion of what constitutes 'the \npublic'.  \n Whether or not we accept the concept of 'post-modernity', we can accept that what \nis currently happening is a 'hollowing out' of the sphere of the public and of the state (e.g. \n 7\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nJessop, 2002); as a partial 'dissolution' of the public realm (Clarke, 2004); and a \ncultivation of the ethical space of the private and responsible individual (Bauman, 1993). \nThe public sphere in which the modern (i.e. supposedly 'old') politics of class and \nredistribution had been conducted is discredited and shrinking and, though a post-modern \n(i.e. supposedly 'new') politics of identity, recognition and respect may be emerging, this \nis valorised within, and largely confined to, the personal or private sphere of the self (cf. \nTaylor, 1998). The personal and the private are not properly connected. To connect the \ntwo requires us, as Nancy Fraser has put it, to 'rethink the public sphere' (1997: ch. 3). \nFor the moment, I am using the notion of 'public sphere' not as a synonym for the \nadministrative state, nor to encompass the formalised realm of the market economy, but \nto refer to the space in which citizens deliberate their common affairs; in which it might \nbe possible to debate the capabilities that are to be valued. While the public forum of \nantiquity may have been constituted as a literal rather than a metaphorical venue, the \npublic sphere of modernity was an abstract ideal with particular significance for liberal \ndemocracies. It is the ideal that has justified a social order in which the state is \nsupposedly disengaged from the functioning of a 'free' market, yet made accountable \nbefore the metaphorical court of public opinion (Habermas, 1962).  \n Fraser's critique of the liberal ideal has four elements. First, the liberal ideal \nassumes that citizens are constituted as formally free and equal and that participation in \nthe public sphere is open upon the same terms to everybody. The capabilities approach is \nin essence a restatement of this ideal. Fraser's argument is that it is impossible to ignore \nthe effects of systemic inequalities in liberal societies that effectively exclude, or \ncompromise participation by, a variety of social classes and groups, including women. \nSecond, the liberal ideal assumes the existence of a single undifferentiated public. \nFraser's argument is that societies are composed of many publics, with competing and \noverlapping interests. In practice, the interests of powerful elites may be advanced in the \nname of defending the common interest, while the interests of subordinate groups are \nignored. Third, the liberal ideal seeks to distinguish between 'private' concerns and \ncommon concerns and to exclude consideration of the former. Fraser argues that \ninasmuch as economic and domestic concerns have been regarded as largely 'private', this \nhas precluded or constrained debate about the nature of both class and gender oppression. \nFinally, the liberal ideal sought a rigid separation between state and civil society. This, \nFraser argues, weakens the effective accountability of the state.   \n Fraser therefore makes the case for a different ideal; for a public sphere or realm \nin which there would be parity of participation and an end to systemic inequalities; in \nwhich diverse publics would be able to communicate across lines of difference; in which \n'publicity' \u2013 in its literal and deepest sense \u2013 would be accorded to 'private' concerns \nwhere these are held in common; in which the boundaries between state and civil society \nwould be permeable as more open forms of democracy develop. It is an argument that \nbuilds on Fraser's earlier critique of the capitalist welfare state and her call for a 'politics \nof needs interpretation' (1989), premised not only on demands for social justice, but also \nfor parity of participation and, literally, for 'publicity' for the needs of poor and oppressed \ngroups. This reconfigured ideal would expose the inequalities and injustices perpetuated \nby capitalism to public reasoning in a way that the capabilities approach has not and \nprobably cannot.  \n \n 8\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nThe exploitation of labour under capitalism \n \nFinally, and fundamentally, the capabilities approach remains largely silent on the issue \nof capitalism itself. It is not and does not purport to be a theory of social change3. Sen is \nclear that hunger and poverty result from human not natural failures (1999) and yet the \ncapability concept does not of itself address the systemic impediments to human freedom \nthat are associated with the capitalist mode of production.  Nussbaum, for her part, is \nclear that the capabilities approach promotes 'truly human functioning' in a sense that she \nattributes to capitalism's arch critic, Karl Marx (Nussbaum, 2006: 85). And yet the \nimplication of the capabilities approach appears to be that human development and \ncapitalist economic development are - potentially, at least - commensurable. \n     Malcolm Bull (2007) has drawn out the common intellectual connections between, on \nthe one hand, the capability approach and, on the other, both the Aristotelian notion of \n'the good life' and Marx's notion in his early writings of 'species being' (1844). But it is \nimportant to grasp how the capability approach departs from the understanding of \ncapitalism to be found in Marx's later writings. Marx contended that 'work' - that is to say \npurposive interaction with the world around us - both defines and constitutes the very \nbasis of humanity's conscious 'species-being' and humanity's social, as opposed to its \nnatural, existence (cf. Arendt, 1958). To that extent, work is different from repetitive and \nunending labour. The problem with capitalism, according to Marx, is that it transforms \nwork into alienated labour, so detaching human beings not only from the objects of their \nproduction but from the essence of their social humanity. Marx's alternative vision - \ncommunism - was of a society in which there would be a unity of humanity and nature. \nTo an extent, therefore, as Malcom Bull has argued, the capabilities approach is \n'equivalent to (and perhaps a substitute for) the projected path of human development \nenvisioned by communism', albeit that they are different because 'moving from bare \ncapability to fully human functioning is alienating just insofar as it is not universal' \n(2007). \n In his later writings, Marx (1887) sought to expose the immanent logic of the \ncommodity form and the wage relation under capitalism. His focus here was upon the \nextent to which the realisation of the surplus value upon which capital accumulation \nprocess depends rests upon the fiction of a free contract and, ultimately, the exploitation \nof labour. Sen (1999: 6) is anxious to defend the principles of free and fair market \nexchange, but Marx's argument had been that, although wage labour is preferable to slave \nlabour, a contract for labour cannot be wholly freely entered so long as one party depends \nupon the sale of her labour power in order to obtain the means of subsistence. Markets for \nthe exchange of goods and services have long served human ends, but a market economy \n'violates the requirements of justice [because] individuals under capitalism do not have \nequal access to advantage' (Callinicos, 2003: 117). What is more, in a market economy, \nnecessary and valuable functionings such as caring for children or for disabled relatives, \nstudying, voluntary work in the community, and amateur artistic endeavour have no \nmarketable value and are not rewarded as 'work' (e.g. Mooney, 2004). In this way, \ncapitalism distorts our perceptions and our experience of work and of our species being. \nIf it does not directly constrain our capabilities, it compromises them, because in a global \n                                                 \n3 I am grateful to Tania Burchardt for this point. \n 9\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \nmarket economy our ability at any particular moment to function as we choose may \nnecessarily be achieved at the expense of others' freedom. \n In fairness to the capability approach one of its great strengths is that indeed it can \nemphasise the value of functionings that are not marketable. Nussbaum's list of central \nhuman functional capabilities includes, for example, 'Being able to use the senses, to \nimagine, think and reason \u2026. to laugh to play, to enjoy recreational activities' (2000b: \n79-78). The Equalities Review's dimensions of equality 'score card' is more prosaic. \nUnder the heading 'Productive and valued activities', it focuses first on 'access to \nemployment', but also upon 'positive experience in the workplace, work\/life balance, and \nbeing able to care for others' (2007: 18), themes that are elaborated elsewhere within its \nreport. Once again, however, it is not simply that the capabilities approach can be too \neasily inflected toward an accommodation with the imperatives of the market economy, \nbut that it is inherently liberal-individualist. The individual is constructed as an abstract \nbearer of freedoms, rights and\/or the capabilities that should ideally flow from these. \nMarx had railed against the illusory rights of social life (or 'civil society') under capitalist \nrelations of production which, far from manifesting the liberty of the subject, are 'nothing \nbut the expression of his absolute enslavement and of the loss of his human nature' (1845: \n225). The abstract nature of the individual citizen betrays an alienated rather an \nemancipated status. The capability approach may demand substantive freedoms to \nchoose, but the subject remains as abstract as ever and her supposed choices are formal \nconstructs, not substantive demands.  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe capabilities approach has undeniable attractions, precisely because of the way in \nwhich it recaptures elements of Aristotle's pre-enlightenment moral philosophy, albeit \nthat it does not and perhaps cannot escape the influence of Western Enlightenment \nliberalism. It should be noted, incidentally, that 'radical Aristotelians' express parallel \nreservations about the Marxist interpretation of Aristotelian moral philosophy \n(Macintyre, 2007). The fact remains, however, that capabilities reflect an abstraction \nfrom philosophical judgements about the nature of human virtues; virtues that exist to be \ndiscovered as opposed to concrete human needs that occur as and when they are \nexperienced.  \n Needs may be translated into claims in the course of a struggle for human \nsurvival. Claims may in turn be translated into rights in the struggle for human \nemancipation. My concern is that the ascendancy of the capabilities approach distracts \nattention from a politics of need (Soper, 1981) or of needs interpretation (Fraser, 1989). \nThe attempt in the UK by or on behalf of the Equalities Review to read off a 'core' set of \ndesirable capabilities from the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) \nwas imaginative. But there is a sense in which this amounts to reading backwards from \nthe outcome of previous historically specific struggles over the interpretation of human \nneeds. The UDHR was a consensual compromise reached in the post-World War II era \nthat made the world safe for the continued expansion of global capitalism. The resulting \nlist of capabilities - translated by the Equalities Review into its dimensions of equality \n 10\nFINAL DRAFT - to appear in Critical Social Policy, vol. 29, no. 2 (2009) \n'score card' - does not of itself challenge the roots of social injustice or the quotidian \nrelations of power through which we struggle to name and claim our needs. \n This article contends that, although it has its limitations, the discourse of rights \nprovides a more immediate strategic terrain for a politics of need than a discourse of \ncapabilities, particularly if capabilities are to be construed at one stage removed from the \ncontext in which our rights have been settled or through which they can be disputed and \nextended. The capabilities approach is well suited to a consensual approach, but a politics \nof need should be about struggle, not consensus: the struggle for the recognition of \nunspoken needs; the struggle for more direct forms of political participation; the struggle \nagainst exploitation and the systemic injustices of capitalism. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nThe author is grateful to Tania Burchardt and Polly Vizard for helpful comments on an earlier draft of this \narticle.
