Introduction \nThe understanding of the influence solid-substrate surface energy has on the wettability characteristics is \nof great importance. Both scientists and engineers alike have a distinct interest in the mechanisms of the \nphenomena since it is one of the principal influences on the wetting, and subsequent adhesion, of \ncoatings, etc., on a selected substrate; therefore, ultimately influencing the in-service performance of any \nsuch article. This paper details work that has been conducted using a 60 W high power diode laser \n(HPDL) in order to determine the effects of HPDL radiation on the surface energy, and consequently the \nwettability characteristics, of a variety of engineering ceramic materials. \nAlthough little work has been carried out to investigate employing lasers to modify the surface properties \nof materials in order to improve their wettability characteristics, it is nevertheless recognised within the \ncurrently published work that laser irradiation of material surfaces can affect changes in the materials \nwettability characteristics. However, the reasons for these changes with regard to changes in the materials \nsurface energy are not reported. Zhou et al [1, 2] have carried out work on laser coating of aluminium \nalloys with ceramic materials (SiO2, Al2O3, etc.), reporting on the well documented fact that generated \noxide layers often promote metal\/oxide wetting. Bahners et al [3, 4], have observed and accounted \ncomprehensively for the changes in technical properties of various textile fibres, including adhesion and \nwetting properties, with a view to developing an alternative to the conventional methods of chemical \nagents addition or wet-chemical pre-processing. Similarly, Kappel [5] has shown that the texturing of \nceramics with an excimer laser can improve the adhesion strength by up to 20%. Such an improvement is \nsaid to be due to the formation of raised microscopic protrusions over the surface.  \n  3 \n2. Theoretical background \nWhen a drop of liquid is in contact with a solid surface, the final shape taken by the drop, and thus \nwhether it will wet the surface or not, depends upon the relative magnitudes of the molecular forces that \nexist within the liquid (cohesive) and between the liquid and the solid (adhesive) [6]. The index of this \neffect is the contact angle, \u03b8, which the liquid subtends with the solid. The adhesion intensity of a liquid \nto a solid surface is known as the work of adhesion, Wad, and is related to the liquid surface energy, \u03b3lv, by \nthe Young-Dupre equation: \n   ( )Wad lv= +\u03b3 \u03b81 cos  (1) \nThe influence of the substrate surface roughness on the wetting contact angle is also of great importance, \nbeing described by Wenzel\u2019s equation: \n ( )r sv sl lv w\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b8\u2212 = cos  (2) \nwhere, r is the roughness factor defined as the ratio of the real and apparent surface areas, \u03b3sv is the solid \nsurface energy, \u03b3sl is the solid-liquid surface energy and \u03b8w is the contact angle for the wetting of a rough \nsurface. Clearly, as Equation (2) shows, the influence of surface roughness on the contact angle is to \naffect an increase in the contact angle. Thus, the smoother the contact surface is, the smaller the contact \nangle will be. \nThe intermolecular attraction which is responsible for surface energy, \u03b3, results from a variety of \nintermolecular forces whose contribution to the total surface energy is additive [7]. The majority of these \nforces are functions of the particular chemical nature of a certain material, and as such the total surface \nenergy (\u03b3) comprises of \u03b3p (polar or non-dispersive interaction) and \u03b3d (dispersive component). As such, \nWad can be expressed as the sum of the different intermolecular forces that act at the interface [7]: \n ( ) ( )W W Wad add adp svd lvd svp lvp= + = +2 2\n1 2 1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\/ \/\n (3) \nBy equating Equation (3) with Equation (1), the contact angle for solid-liquid systems can be related to \nthe surface energies of the respective liquid and solid by \n \n( ) ( )\ncos\n\/ \/\n\u03b8\n\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b3\n\u03b3\n=\n+\n\u2212\n2 2\n1\n1 2 1 2\nsv\nd\nlv\nd\nsv\np\nlv\np\nlv\n (4) \n \n \n  4 \n3. Experimental procedures \nThe laser used in the study was a 60 W HPDL, emitting at 810nm \u00b120nm. The laser beam was delivered \nto the samples by means of a 600\u00b5m core diameter optical fibre, the end of which was connected to a 2:1 \nfocusing lens assembly mounted on the z-axis of a 3-axis CNC table. The defocused laser beam was fired \nacross the surfaces of the ceramic materials by traversing the samples beneath the laser beam using the x- \nand y-axis of the CNC table at speeds of 5-8 mm\/s, whilst 3 l\/min of coaxially blown O2 assist gas was \nused to shield the laser optics. \nThe liquids used for the wetting experiments were human blood, human blood plasma, glycerol and               \n4-octanol. The test liquids, along with their total surface energy ( \u03b3 2 ) as well as the dispersive ( \u03b3 2\nd ) and \npolar ( \u03b3 2\np ) components, are detailed in Table 1. The solid materials used as substrates in the wetting \nexperiments were squares (10 x 10mm with a thickness of 3mm) of common engineering ceramic \nmaterials; unglazed ceramic tile, clay quarry tile, Al2O3 and SiO2-TiO2 (crystalline). The contact surfaces \nof the materials were polished (3\u00b5m) and cleaned in an ultrasonic bath.  \nThe wetting experiments were carried out in atmospheric conditions at a temperature of 200C. The \ndroplets were released in a controlled manner onto the surface of the test substrate materials  (treated and \nuntreated) from the tip of a micropipette, with the resultant volume of the drops being approximately        \n6 x 10-3 cm3. Each experiment lasted for three minutes with profile photographs of the sessile drops being \nobtained every minute, with the contact angle subsequently being measured. The experimental results \nshowed that throughout the period of the tests no discernible change in the magnitude of the contact angle \noccurred.  \n4. Results and discussion \nAs one can see from Table 2, laser irradiation of the substrate material surfaces resulted in all the \nmaterials displaying a reduction in the contact angle. One explanation for this is that the surfaces obtained \nafter laser treatment are significantly smoother than the original untreated surfaces (Fig.1 and Fig.2). \nThus, according to Equation (2), the smoother surface will inherently result in a reduction in the contact \nangle. \nAlso, the improvements in the wetting action experienced by all the materials will have certainly been \ninfluenced by the increase in the surface oxygen content of the ceramic materials as a result of the laser \ntreatment; since this is known to increase the likelihood of wetting [8, 9]. Indeed, by mounting cross-\nsectioned samples of the untreated and laser treated ceramic materials next to each other, and examining \nthem both simultaneously by means of energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX), it was possible to \n  5 \ndetermine the relative element content of oxygen near the material surfaces. As one can see from Fig. 3, \nthe surface oxygen content was observed to increase in all the ceramic materials after laser treatment due \nto the oxidisation on the laser treated surfaces of the materials, thus indicating that oxygen enrichment of \nthe laser treated ceramic material surfaces was active in promoting wetting and adhesion [8, 9]. \nIt is possible to estimate the dispersive component of the ceramic materials surface energy \u03b3 sv\nd\n by using \nEquation (4), and plotting the graph of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv (Fig. 3). Thus the value of \u03b3 sv\nd\n is \nestimated by the gradient (=2(\u03b3 sv\nd\n)1\/2) of the line which connects the origin (cos \u03b8 = -1) with the intercept \npoint of the straight line (cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) correlating the data point with the abscissa at cos \u03b8 = 1 \n[7]. The values of \u03b3 sv\nd\nfor the untreated and laser treated ceramic materials are shown in Table 3. From the \nbest-fit plots of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv, it was found that the ordinate intercept points of the untreated \nceramic materials-liquid systems were closer to cos \u03b8 = -1 than those for the laser treated ceramic \nmaterials-liquid systems. This indicates that, in principle, dispersion forces act mainly at the ceramic \nmaterials-liquid interfaces resulting in poor adhesion [7, 10]. In contrast, the best-fit straight line for the \nlaser treated ceramic materials-liquid systems intercepted the ordinate considerably higher above the \norigin. This is indicative of the action of polar forces across the interface, in addition to dispersion forces, \nhence improved wettability and adhesion is promoted [7, 10]. \nIt is not possible to determine the value of the polar component of the ceramic materials surface energy \n\u03b3 sv\np\n directly from plots of cos \u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv.  This is because the intercept of the straight line (cos \n\u03b8 against (\u03b3 lv\nd\n)1\/2\/\u03b3lv) is at ( )2\n1 2\n\u03b3 \u03b3sv\np\nlv\np\n\/\n\/\u03b3lv, and thus only refers to individual control liquids and not the \ncontrol liquid system. However, it has been established that the entire amount of the surface energies due \nto dispersion forces either of the solids or the liquids are active in the wettability performance [7, 11]. \nThus it is possible to calculate the dispersive component of the work of adhesion, Wad\nd\n from Equation (3). \nThe results revealed that for each particular control liquid in contact with both the untreated and laser \ntreated ceramic materials surfaces, Wad  could be correlated with Wad\nd\n by a linear relationship. Also, for \nthe control test liquids used, a linear relationship between the dispersive and polar components of the \ncontrol test liquids surface energies could also be deduced. By combining these linear relationships and \ndifferentiating with respect to ( )\u03b3 lvd\n1 2\/\n, the following can be derived: \n  ( )\n( ) ( )\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nsv\np sv\nd a1 2\n1 2\n1\n13\n\/\n\/\n.\n=\n\u2212\n (5) \n  6 \nFrom a plot of the linear relationship between Wad\np\nand Wad\nd\n, a was determined for the untreated and laser \ntreated ceramic materials. Since \u03b3 sv\nd\n has already been determined for the untreated and laser treated \nceramic materials from the plots of Equation 4, it is possible to calculate \u03b3 sv\np\n for untreated and laser \ntreated ceramic materials using Equation (5) (see Table 3) \nAs Table 3 shows clearly, HPDL treatment of the surface of the ceramic materials has led to an increase \nin the polar component of the surface energy\u03b3 sv\np\n, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \nSuch changes in the surface energy of the ceramic materials after laser treatment are due to the fact that \nHPDL treatment of the surface of these ceramic materials results in partial vitrification of the surface; a \ntransition that is known to affect an increase in \u03b3 sv\np\n [12]. \n5. Conclusion \nLaser treatment of the surfaces of all the selected ceramic materials resulted in a reduction in the contact \nangles with the test liquids. Improvements in the wetting action of the ceramic materials after laser \ntreatment were identified as being due to: \n\u2022 The laser sintering of the ceramic materials surfaces reducing the surface roughness, thus \ndirectly reducing the contact angle \u03b8. \n\u2022 The increase in the polar component of the surface energy, \u03b3 sv\np\n, after laser treatment as a result \nof the partial laser vitrification of the glass forming elements within the ceramic materials \ncomposition, thus improving the action of wetting and adhesion. \n\u2022 The increase in the surface oxygen content of the ceramic materials resulting from laser \ntreatment was identified as further promoting the action of wetting. \nThis work demonstrates that it is possible to alter the wetting characteristics of the selected ceramic \nmaterials using the HPDL. Moreover, the findings of this work show that with the use of laser radiation it \nis a distinct possibility that the wetting characteristics of many other materials could be altered, based on \nsimilar mechanisms identified for the selected ceramic materials. \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to the EPSRC: Process Engineering Group (Grant No. \nGR\/K99770), the EPSRC: CDP Group (CASE Award No. 95562556) and BNFL for their financial \nsupport.  \n \n  7 \nReferences \n1.
