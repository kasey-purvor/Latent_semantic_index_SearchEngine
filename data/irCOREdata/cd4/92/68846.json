Both\nprocesses may be regulated by changes in plant\nhormone concentrations. Tomato plants (Solanum\nlycopersicum L. cv Moneymaker) were cultivated\nhydroponically for 3 weeks under high salinity (100 mM\nNaCl) and five major plant hormones (abscisic acid,\nABA; the cytokinins zeatin, Z, and zeatin-riboside, ZR;\nthe auxin indole-3-acetic acid, IAA; and the ethylene\nprecursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid,\nACC) were determined weekly in roots, xylem sap, and\nleaves. Salinity reduced shoot biomass by 50\u201360% and\nphotosynthetic area by 20\u201325% both by decreasing\nleaf expansion and delaying leaf appearance, while\nroot growth was less affected, thus increasing the\nroot\/shoot ratio. ABA and ACC concentrations\nstrongly increased in roots, xylem sap, and leaves\nafter 1 d (ABA) and 15 d (ACC) of salinization.

Salinity dramatically de-\ncreased the Z+ZR content of the plant, and induced the\nconversion of ZR into Z, especially in the roots, which\naccounted for the relative increase of cytokinins in the\nroots compared to the leaf. IAA concentration was also\nstrongly decreased in the leaves while it accumulated\nin the roots. Decreased cytokinin content and its\ntransport from the root to the shoot were probably\ninduced by the basipetal transport of auxin from the\nshoot to the root. The auxin\/cytokinin ratio in the\nleaves and roots may explain both the salinity-induced\ndecrease in shoot vigour (leaf growth and leaf number)\nand the shift in biomass allocation to the roots, in\nagreement with changes in the activity of the sink-\nrelated enzyme cell wall invertase.\nKey words: Abscisic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic\nacid, indole-3-acetic acid, plant hormones, salt stress, sodium\nchloride, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), zeatin, zeatin-\nriboside.\n* AA and MEG contributed equally to this work.\ny Present address: Department of Horticulture-Seed Biology, Oregon State University, OR 97331, Corvallis, USA.\nz To whom correspondence should be addressed: E-mail: alfocea@cebas.csic.es\nAbbreviations: ABA, abscisic acid; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; CK, cytokinin; CWIN, cell wall invertase; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; RGR,\nrelative growth rate; RER, relative expansion rate; Z, zeatin; ZR, zeatin riboside.\n\u00aa 2008 The Author(s).\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc\/2.0\/uk\/) which\npermits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nIntroduction\nSalinity is a major factor reducing crop productivity in\nagriculture as well as a major cause of the abandonment\nof lands and aquifers for agricultural purposes. Improving\nthe use of such marginal resources requires insight about\ntheir limiting effects on plant development. The release of\nsalt-tolerant crops to optimize the use of salt-contaminated\nwater and soil resources has been a much prosecuted\nscientific goal but with little success to date, as few major\ndeterminant genetic traits of salt tolerance have been\nidentified (Flowers, 2004; Munns, 2005). Although main-\ntenance of ionic and water homeostasis is necessary for\nplant survival, salinity decreases crop productivity both by\nreducing leaf growth and inducing leaf senescence. This\nlowers the total photosynthetic capacity of the plant, thus\nlimiting its ability to generate further growth or harvest-\nable biomass and also to maintain defence mechanisms\nagainst the stress (Yeo, 2007).\nThe major physiological processes believed to be\ninvolved in the control of plant growth under salinity\nhave been water relations, hormonal balance, and carbon\nsupply, with their respective importance depending on the\ntime scale of the response (Munns, 2002). Salinity affects\nplant growth in two phases (Munns, 1993). During the\ninitial phase of salinity, the osmotic effect predominates\nand induces water stress due to the high salt concentration\nin the root medium. During this phase, shoot growth arrest\noccurs very quickly (seconds to minutes) but recovers\n(over several hours) to a new steady-state that is\nconsiderably lower than under non-stress conditions.\nThese changes seem to be driven by changes in water\nrelations (Munns, 2002), but during this initial period\nwhen osmotic effects predominate (days to weeks),\ngrowth seems to be regulated by hormones and\/or\ncarbohydrates. During the second phase of the stress\n(weeks to months), growth is governed by toxic effects\ndue to the high salt accumulation in leaf tissues.\nOverall, salinity affects plant productivity by reducing\nthe photosynthetic area by inhibiting cell division and cell\nexpansion rates during leaf growth and by affecting\ndevelopmental programmes regulating leaf emergence,\nthe production of lateral primordia, and the formation of\nreproductive organs (Munns, 2002). However, the mech-\nanism(s) that down-regulates leaf growth and shoot\ndevelopment under the osmotic phase of salinity is not\nknown. It has been hypothesized that leaf growth in-\nhibition must be regulated by hormones or their precur-\nsors, because the reduced leaf growth rate is independent\nof carbohydrate supply, water status, nutrient deficiency,\nand ion toxicity (see Munns and Tester, 2008, for\na review). Since plant meristems are actively growing\ntissues where cell division governs sink strength, environ-\nmental signals can modulate plant responses to the\ngrowing conditions through changes in phytohormone\nconcentrations, thus controlling assimilate partitioning\nbetween different sink tissues (Hartig and Beck, 2006).\nThese hormonal changes not only influence the\nadaptive response but also affect the normal growth of\nthe harvestable organs and thus influence economic\nproductivity. Hence, plant hormones are considered\na primary component of the signalling pathways control-\nling these processes.\nThis integrated plasticity in plant development probably\ninvolves long-distance communication between different\norgans with hormones playing an essential role (Sachs,\n2005) or differential changes in root and shoot hormone\nconcentrations. Although salinity increased plant ABA\nconcentration in all plant compartments (Wolf et al.,\n1990; Kefu et al., 1991), its role in growth regulation has\nbeen equivocal as different studies have suggested it can\ninhibit (Dodd and Davies, 1996) or maintain growth by\nrestricting the evolution of ethylene, another potential\ngrowth inhibitor (Sharp and LeNoble, 2002). Both\ncytokinins and auxins act as endogenous mitogens whose\nconcentrations can be environmentally modulated to\nregulate the formation of roots and shoots and their\nrelative growth (Werner et al., 2001; Sachs, 2005). It has\nbeen hypothesized that a decrease in CK supply from the\nroot to the shoot could inhibit leaf growth while a low CK\ncontent would promote root growth and thus the root\/\nshoot ratio (van der Werf and Nagel, 1996; Rahayu et al.,\n2005). It has been reported that salinity decreased the\nauxin indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels in the roots but not in\nthe leaves of tomato plants (Dunlap and Binzel, 1996),\nwhile leaf zeatin concentration declined under osmotic\nstress in tomato (Walker and Dumbroff, 1981). However,\nsince many of these (relatively scarce) studies were only\nable to measure one or two of the major hormone groups\nfollowing a step-change in salinity or any other stress,\ninterpretation of changes in biomass allocation by specific\nauthors has generally favoured the hormones that each\nauthor measured, and thus there are several divergent\nhypotheses of the regulation of biomass allocation (van\nder Werf and Nagel, 1996; Munns and Cramer, 1996;\nSachs, 2005) that co-exist in the literature.\nThe advent of multi-analyte techniques for hormone\nquantification allows a far more comprehensive analysis\nof the changes in plant hormone status following salinity.\nAccordingly, the endogenous concentrations of five major\nplant hormones; ABA, ACC, IAA, and two major active\ncytokinins (Davey and van Staden, 1976) in tomato, Z and\nZR, were analysed in leaves of a cultivated tomato\ngenotype submitted to salinity stress (100 mM NaCl for 3\nweeks), in order to study the influence of local changes in\nboth plant hormones and ionic status on leaf senescence\n(Ghanem et al., 2008). In this study, however, root and\nxylem hormone concentrations were measured to evaluate\nwhether differential hormonal changes in and between\nroots and shoots regulated growth and biomass\n4120 Albacete et al.\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \npartitioning under salinity. Tomato was chosen for this\nwork since it is an economically important crop, whose\ncropping area (particularly in the Mediterranean) is often\nlimited by the availability of sufficient high quality (non-\nsaline) water for irrigation.\nMaterials and methods\nPlant material and culture conditions\nSeeds of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) cv. Moneymaker were\nobtained from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center (TGRC)\n(University of California-Davis, CA, USA). Seeds were sown in\ntrays filled with a perlite-vermiculite mix (1:3 v\/v proportion)\nmoistened regularly with half-strength Hoagland\u2019s nutrient solution.\nFourteen days after sowing, the substrate was gently washed from\nthe roots and seedlings placed on polyvinyl chloride plates floating\non aerated half-strength Hoagland\u2019s nutrient solution in a growth\nchamber. Solutions were refilled every 2 d and renewed every\nweek.\nPlants were grown in a growth chamber under a 16 h daylight\nperiod. The air temperature ranged from 25\u201328 \u0001C during the day\nand 17\u201318 \u0001C during the night. Relative humidity was maintained at\n7065% during the night and at 5065% during the day. Light\nintensity at the top of the canopy was around 245 lmol m\u00012 s\u00011\n(PPFD). After 4 d acclimation in control conditions (18 d after\nsowing), the seedlings were exposed to 0 mM (control) or 100 mM\nNaCl added to the nutrient solution for three more weeks. Three\nreplications with eight plants per replication and salt treatment were\nused. An actively growing leaf, present at the moment that salt\nstress was applied (identified as leaf number 4 by numbering from\nthe base of the plant) was tagged for subsequent growth measure-\nments and harvest for biochemical determinations. Six plants per\ntreatment were harvested for different analyses at 1, 9, 15, and 22 d\nof salt treatment. Xylem sap was obtained from three plants per\ntreatment immediately after severing the shoot about 2\u20133 cm above\nthe root system. The root system was placed into a Scholander\npressure chamber, and samples obtained by applying a nitrogen\npressure similar to the leaf water potential (\u20130.5 MPa for control\nplants and about \u20130.9 MPa for stressed ones) in order to maintain\nsap flow rates as close as possible to whole plant transpiration rate\n(Pe\u00b4rez-Alfocea et al., 2000).\nVegetative growth assessment\nSix plants per treatment were used for growth analysis. The number\nof leaves on the main stem with a length >2 cm was recorded every\n2 d, and the rate of leaf appearance was estimated from the slope of\nleaf number versus time. At each harvest, the shoots and roots of\neach plant were separated and weighed to determine fresh weight\n(FW) and the root\/shoot ratio. The area of the tagged leaf 4 was\ndetermined by using a Li-Cor 3100 area meter (Li-Cor Inc.,\nLincoln, Nebraska, USA). The relative growth rate (RGR) on a FW\nbasis, and the relative expansion rate (RER) of leaf 4, and the RGR\nof the root system, were evaluated as the increase in FW or leaf area\nper unit of FW or leaf area present per unit of time and were\nestimated from the equation [(lnPt2\u2013lnPt1)\/(t2\u2013t1)], where Pt2 and\nPt1 are the values of each parameter at the end (t2) and at the\nbeginning (t1) of the corresponding growing period.\nHormone extraction and analysis\nCytokinins (zeatin, Z, and zeatin riboside, ZR), indole-3-acetic acid\n(IAA), and abscisic acid (ABA) were extracted and purified\naccording to the method of Dobrev and Kaminek (2002). One gram\nof fresh plant material (leaf or root) was homogenized in liquid\nnitrogen and placed in 5 ml of cold (\u201320 \u0001C) extraction mixture of\nmethanol\/water\/formic acid (15\/4\/1 by vol., pH 2.5). After over-\nnight extraction at \u201320 \u0001C solids were separated by centrifugation\n(20 000 g, 15 min) and re-extracted for 30 min in an additional 5 ml\nof the same extraction solution. Pooled supernatants were passed\nthrough a Sep-Pak Plus yC18 cartridge (SepPak Plus, Waters, USA)\nto remove interfering lipids and plant pigments and evaporated to\ndryness. The residue was dissolved in 5 ml of 1 M formic acid and\nloaded on an Oasis MCX mixed mode (cation-exchange and reverse\nphase) column (150 mg, Waters, USA) preconditioned with 5 ml of\nmethanol followed by 5 ml of 1 M formic acid. To separate\ndifferent CK forms (nucleotides, bases, ribosides, and glucosides)\nfrom IAA and ABA, the column was washed and eluted stepwise\nwith different appropriate solutions indicated in Dobrev and\nKaminek (2002). ABA and IAA were analysed in the same fraction.\nAfter each solvent was passed through the columns, they were\npurged briefly with air. Solvents were evaporated at 40 \u0001C under\nvacuum. Samples then dissolved in a water\/acetonitrile\/formic acid\n(94.9:5:0.1 by vol.) mixture for HPLC\/MS analysis. Analyses were\ncarried out on a HPLC\/MS system consisting of an Agilent 1100\nSeries HPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)\nequipped with a l-well plate autosampler and a capillary pump,\nand connected to an Agilent Ion Trap XCT Plus mass spectrometer\n(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using an electro-\nspray (ESI) interface. Prior to injection, 100 ll of each fraction\nextracted from tissues or a similar volume of xylem sap were\nfiltered through 13 mm diameter Millex filters with 0.22 lm pore\nsize nylon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). 8 ll of each\nsample, dissolved in mobile phase A, was injected onto a Zorbax\nSB-C18 HPLC column (5 lm, 15030.5 mm, Agilent Technologies,\nSanta Clara, CA, USA), maintained at 40 \u0001C, and eluted at a flow\nrate of 10 ll min\u00011. Mobile phase A, consisting of water\/\nacetonitrile\/formic acid (94.9:5:0.1 by vol.), and mobile phase B,\nconsisting of water\/acetonitrile\/formic acid (10:89.9:0.1 by vol.),\nwere used for the chromatographic separation. The elution pro-\ngramme maintained 100% A for 5 min, then a linear gradient from\n0% to 6% B in 10 min, followed by another linear gradient from\n6% to 100% B in 5 min, and finally 100% B maintained for another\n5 min. The column was equilibrated with the starting composition\nof the mobile phase for 30 min before each analytical run. The UV\nchromatogram was recorded at 280 nm with a DAD module\n(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mass spectrom-\neter was operated in the positive mode with a capillary spray voltage\nof 3500 V, and a scan speed of 22 000 m\/z s\u00011 from 50\u2013500 m\/z.\nThe nebulizer gas (He) pressure was set to 30 psi, whereas the drying\ngas was set to a flow of 6.0 l min\u00011 at a temperature of 350 \u0001C.

ACC was extracted with 80% (v\/v) ethanol and assayed by\ndegradation with alkaline hypochlorite in the presence of 5 mM\nHgCl2 (Casas et al., 1989). A preliminary purification step was\nperformed by passing the extract through a Dowex 50W-X8, 50\u2013\n100 mesh, H+-form resin and later recovered with 0.1 N NH4OH.\nThe conversion efficiency of ACC into ethylene was calculated\nseparately by using a replicate sample containing 2.5 nmol of ACC\nas an internal standard and used for the correction of data.\nHormones in salinized tomato 4121\n at Lancaster University on 10 December 2009 http:\/\/jxb.oxfordjournals.orgDownloaded from \nEnzyme extraction and assay\nFor cell wall invertase activity (CWIN, EC 3.2.1.25), the enzyme\nextracts were prepared essentially as described in Balibrea et al.\n(1999). Fresh leaf or root tissue samples (100 mg) were frozen with\nliquid nitrogen and stored at \u000120 \u0001C until analysis.

After\ncentrifugation at 20 000 g, the supernatant was discarded and the\npellet was washed three times and resuspended in 30 mM acetate\nbuffer (pH 5). The amount of hexose was determined through an\nenzyme-linked assay monitoring NADH formation at 340 nm, after\nadding 25 ll 0.6 M sucrose and incubating at 30 \u0001C for 15 min.

The\nstatistical significance of the results was analysed by the Student\u2013\nNewman\u2013Keuls test at the 5% level.\nResults\nPlant development and biomass allocation\nSalinization decreased shoot fresh weight by 50\u201360%\n(compared to control plants) from the first week of\nsalinization (Fig. 1A). However, root fresh weight was\nonly significantly affected (30%) after 3 weeks under\nsaline conditions (Fig. 1B). As a consequence, salinization\nincreased the root\/shoot ratio by 2-fold compared to\ncontrol plants, reaching the highest values after the first\nweek of salinization (Fig. 1C).\nShoot growth reduction during the first week of salinity\nwas attributable partially to an arrest in the appearance of\nnew leaves, which was detected from day 5 (Fig. 2A). By\nday 9, the salinized plants had three fewer leaves than the\ncontrol plants. After this 4 d growth arrest, leaf appear-\nance rate recovered to control values (about 1 new leaf\nevery 2 d).\nAnother major factor limiting shoot growth was the\nimpaired development of individual leaves. After 3 weeks\nof salinity, fresh weight and area of actively expanding\nleaves (4 g FW and 100 cm2 at the time of imposing\nsalinity) were decreased by 60% and 25%, respectively\n(Fig. 2B, C).\nHormonal profiling\nCytokinins: Although ZR concentrations were 2-fold\nlower in the root than in the leaf (cf. Fig. 3D, F), they\nshowed similar dynamics through the experiment, as they\ndid in xylem sap (Fig. 3E), with an immediate and\nsustained decrease in ZR concentration following the\nFig. 1.

By contrast, the transient (day 1)\nincrease in leaf Z concentration following salinity (Gha-\nnem et al., 2008) was maintained throughout the experi-\nment in the roots (cf. Fig. 3A, C). Xylem sap Z\nconcentrations progressively decreased throughout the\nexperiment (Fig. 3B). Since ZR concentrations were 4.5-,\n5-, and 10-fold higher than Z ones in leaves, xylem sap, and\nroots, respectively, the total CK (Z+ZR) concentration was\ndecreased by salinity throughout the experiment [except on\nday 1 in the leaves, as noted previously (Ghanem et al.,\n2008) where the decrease in ZR concentration sustained the\nincrease in Z concentration] (Fig. 3G, H, I).\nIndeed, the ratio between (the putatively more active)\nzeatin and one of its supposed storage forms (ZR) was\nmaintained almost constant in both leaves and roots under\ncontrol conditions (Fig. 3J, L). However, salinity pro-\nvoked a general increase in the Z\/ZR ratio following leaf\ndevelopment, but it occurred especially and more pro-\ngressively in the roots (from 2 to 12 times more than in\ncontrol roots, following salinization). Only in the xylem\nsap of control plants did the Z\/ZR ratio increase with time,\nbut it was reduced under salinity during the second week\n(Fig. 3K).\nIndoleacetic acid (IAA): Salinity induced opposite changes\nin IAA concentrations in leaves and roots. Salinity\ndecreased leaf IAA concentration by 80% (Fig. 4A), but\nincreased root IAA concentration 2-fold (Fig. 4B) during\nthe first day of salt treatment, compared with control\nplants. These changes remained statistically significant\nthroughout the experiment, even though leaf IAA levels of\nboth control and salinized plants fluctuated with time.\nThe IAA\/(Z+ZR) ratio in the leaves fluctuated in both\ntreatments throughout the experiment, and reached mini-\nmum values in salinized plants during the first and\nthird weeks (Fig. 4C), coinciding with the greatest\nsalinity-induced growth reduction (Fig. 2B, C). By\ncontrast, the maximum IAA\/(Z+ZR) ratios were in the\nroots of salinized plants, and were 2\u20133 times higher than\ncontrol plants from the first day of salinization (Fig. 4D).\nAbscisic acid (ABA) and aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid\n(ACC): ABA concentrations of both roots and leaves\n(although not xylem sap) increased on the first day of\nsalinity and with time in all compartments, reaching up to\n8-fold, 4-fold, and 2.3-fold higher concentrations than\ncontrol plants in roots, leaves, and xylem sap, respectively\n(Fig. 5A, B, C). Increased ACC concentrations in re-\nsponse to salinization were first detected on day 15 in both\nleaves and xylem sap, but not in roots (Fig. 5D, E, F).\nACC increased with time in all compartments, reaching\n2.4-fold, 12-fold, and 30-fold higher than control plants\nby the end of the experiment in roots, leaves, and xylem\nsap, respectively.\nFig. 2.

However, root\nCWIN activity was significantly increased from the\nsecond week of salinization.\nLeaf to root hormonal ratios\nRelative changes in hormone concentrations between leaves\nand roots may explain relative changes in growth ratios\nand biomass partitioning induced by salt stress. In spite of\nthe small effect on leaf Z concentration, salinity decreased\nthe [Z]leaf\/[Z]root ratio by 60\u201370% compared with the\ncontrol plants from the first week (Fig. 7A), while it\nincreased the [ZR]leaf\/[ZR]root by 40% during the same\nperiod (Fig. 7B). Since these changes were somewhat\ncompensatory, the leaf\/root ratio for total CK (Z+ZR) was\nonly reduced by 20% during the last two weeks of\nsalinization, and a similar increase occurred on day 1\n(Fig. 7C). The most dramatic change induced by salinity\nwas the 70\u201395% decrease in [IAA]leaf\/[IAA]root ratio from\nthe first day of salinity and throughout the experiment\n(Fig. 7D). As in the case of ZR, the [ABA]leaf\/[ABA]root\nand the [ACC]leaf\/[ACC]root ratios were also increased by\nsalinity during the experiment (Fig. 7E, F). Thus, salinity\nfavours the accumulation of CK (especially Z) and IAA in\nthe roots compared to a mature leaf, while it promotes the\naccumulation of ABA and the ethylene precursor ACC in\nthe leaf compared to the roots.\nCorrelation analysis: Relative leaf growth (expressed as\neither fresh weight, RGR, or area, RER) was positively\ncorrelated with the leaf IAA concentration (r\u00bc0.89, P\n<0.001) and still more closely with the IAA\/(Z+ZR) ratio\n(Fig. 8A, B). No significant correlations were found\nbetween the other leaf hormonal concentrations or ratios\nand leaf growth (Table 1). However, while both shoot and\nroot RGR were positively correlated with leaf Z, ZR, and\nZ+ZR concentrations (r\u00bc0.82\u20130.93, P <0.05; Table 1),\nthe RGR of the root was negatively correlated with\nthe [Z+ZR]root\/[Z+ZR]leaf ratio (r \u00bc \u20130.83, P <0.05)\nFig. 3.

Interestingly, the accumulation of IAA in the\nroot was negatively correlated with leaf growth parame-\nters, while the ratios of both CK (Z+ZR) and IAA with\nABA in the root were positively correlated with shoot\ngrowth (Table 1).\nDiscussion\nAlthough the economic impact of salinity on tomatoes\ndepends on fruit growth, overall plant growth can first be\nconsidered as two local processes (shoot and root de-\nvelopment) but also as co-ordinated responses between\ndifferent organs (biomass partitioning), which must be\nessentially regulated by hormones (Sachs, 2005). During\nthis time, prior to ion toxicity, when the osmotic stress\nand nutrient imbalances (e.g. N uptake) mediate changes\nin hormone concentrations (Pe\u00b4rez-Alfocea et al., 1993;\nMunns, 2002; Rahayu et al., 2005; Ghanem et al., 2008;\nMunns and Tester, 2008), growth responses may account\nfor differences in the overall plant productivity by\nmaintaining ion homeostasis and generating new energetic\nresources (Balibrea et al., 2000; Munns and Tester, 2008).\nShoot growth regulation\nSalinity decreased both the total number of leaves (Fig.\n2A) and the growth of individual leaves (Fig. 2B, C), thus\ncell division, elongation, and primordium formation were\nall decreased. Shoot CK and auxins are probably involved\nin these processes since they were strongly reduced by\nsalinity in the shoot tissues: about 50% for Z+ZR contents\nin leaf (Ghanem et al., 2008) and xylem sap, and 50\u201390%\nfor IAA during leaf development. This idea is supported\nby the significant correlation found between both the leaf\nIAA content and the IAA\/(Z+ZR) ratio with leaf de-\nvelopment under both control and saline conditions (Fig.\n8A, B; Table 1). In addition, the leaf CK (ZR and Z+ZR)\nconcentrations were also positively correlated with the overall\nshoot growth capacity (Table 1), which may be explained\nnot only by promoting cell division but also by delaying leaf\nsenescence under salinity (Ghanem et al., 2008).\nThe phenotype of salinized tomato plants, where leaf\nCKX activity was enhanced by salinity (Ghanem et al.,\n2008), was similar to that of CKX-transgenic tobacco\nplants (Werner et al., 2001), where total CK contents were\nalso diminished compared to the wild type. In both cases,\nleaf growth and the leaf appearance rate were strongly\nFig. 4. IAA concentration and IAA\/(Z+ZR) ratio of leaf 4 (A, C) and root (B, D) of tomato plants (cv.

Assuming that\nchanges in leaf hormone concentration also occur in other\nparts of the shoot, delayed leaf appearance (Fig. 2A) could\nbe explained by the decrease in shoot IAA concentration\nduring the first days of salt treatment. The later recovery\nin leaf appearance rate coincided with the increased IAA\nconcentration and IAA\/Z+ZR ratio in the leaf (Fig. 4A,\nC). Since CK and auxin contents changed in parallel, it is\ndifficult to resolve their independent effects and more\nfunctional work is needed, but it is interesting to note that\nboth hormones could exert a major control on the leaf\ngrowth rate, as suggested from correlative analysis\n(Fig. 8A, B; Table 1), probably by promoting cell\nelongation after cell division.\nAlthough increased leaf ABA accumulation (Fig. 5A)\nwas correlated with impaired shoot development (Figs 1,\n2), experiments investigating natural genetic variation in\nABA concentration of salinized plants showed a positive\n(de Costa et al., 2007) or negative (Cramer and Quarrie,\n2002; He and Cramer, 1996) correlation between leaf area\nand ABA concentration, and further studies are needed to\ndetermine the physiological significance (if any) of such\ncorrelations. That one of the functions of ABA\nFig. 5. ABA and ACC concentrations of leaf 4 (A, D), xylem sap (B, E), and roots (C, F)) of tomato plants (cv.

That ethylene\ninhibits shoot growth of salinized plants was suggested by\nthe improved growth of transgenic canola containing ACC\ndeaminase activity (Sergeeva et al., 2006). Although ACC\nlevels were at the limit of detection of our analytical\nprocedures, the fact that leaf and xylem ACC concen-\ntrations increased during the third week of salinization\n(Fig. 5) while growth was inhibited from the first week of\nsalinization (Figs 1, 2), suggests that it was unlikely that\nACC was responsible for the initial reduction in leaf\ngrowth and leaf appearance rate (Fig. 2).\nRoot growth regulation\nSince CKs promote shoot growth but inhibit root growth\n(Thomas et al., 1995), low root CK content could\nstimulate or maintain root growth by prolonging the\nmeristematic phase and thus increasing the number of\ncells before root elongation took place, as suggested for\nCKX-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibiting en-\nhanced root development (Werner et al., 2001). Indeed,\nthe relative accumulation of CKs in the roots compared to\nthe leaves (Fig. 7A, C) may be involved in the late root\ngrowth reduction under salinity, as these parameters were\nnegatively correlated (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, salinity\nactually increased root Z concentration from day 1 (Fig.\n3C), probably due to conversion from its conjugate ZR\n(Fig. 3L), which should inhibit root growth rather than\npromote it. However, variable effects of CKs as a function\nof concentration and tissue specificity, suggests that\na positive role of the increased root Z concentration on\nroot growth cannot be ruled out. Indeed, exogenous CKs,\nespecially the most active form Z, but also its derivatives\nsuch as ZR, stimulated tomato root growth (length and\nfrequency) at very low concentrations (10\u000111 M) but\ninhibited growth at higher concentrations (Taylor and van\nStaden, 1998).\nThe interaction of CKs with other hormones such as\nauxins can also influence root biomass allocation (Sachs,\n2005). Although salinity (300 mM for an unknown\nperiod) decreased root IAA concentration in tomato\n(Dunlap and Binzel, 1996), salt-induced auxin accumula-\ntion in the roots increased the auxin\/CK ratio (Fig. 4B, D),\nwhich may promote cell elongation and root growth.\nSince auxin is formed in developing and mature leaves\nand is necessary for the formation of lateral primordia in\nboth root and shoot apical meristems (Kepinski, 2006),\na link between acropetal and basipetal auxin transport has\nbeen suggested to co-ordinate shoot and root responses to\nenvironmental stimuli depending on the organ of detection\n(Casimiro et al., 2001; Sachs, 2005). Furthermore, IAA\nmay act as a negative feed-back signal temporarily to\nrepress CK synthesis in the roots and their xylem transport\nto the shoot (Bangerth, 1994; Rahayu et al., 2005), as\nseems to occur under salinity (this study).\nMoreover, increased assimilate partitioning to the roots\ncan be explained by changes in CWIN activity in both\nroots and leaves, as reported in CK-deficient tobacco\nplants (Werner et al., 2008). This enzyme regulates\nsucrose transport by controlling the apoplastic unloading\nstep from phloem (Roitsch et al., 2003). However,\nalthough CKs are major hormones establishing sink\nactivity through the co-ordinated induction of extracellular\ninvertases and hexose transporters in order to enhance\nphloem carbohydrate supply to actively growing tissues\n(Roitsch et al., 2000), this response seems to depend on\nthe tissue, and Z is unlikely to be responsible for the\nCWIN induction in the roots. This idea is supported by\nthe induction or maintenance of this enzyme activity\nreported in the roots of CKX-overexpressing tobacco\nplants (Werner et al., 2008) with lowered total CK and Z\ncontents (Werner et al., 2001). However, IAA seems to\ninduce both sink (sucrose allocation) and CWIN activities\nFig. 6. Cell wall invertase activity (CWIN)of leaf 4 and roots of tomato\nplants (cv.

Albacete et al., unpublished results), supporting its role\nin the relative increase in the root sink strength under\nsalinity.\nSimilar to its action in the shoot, ABA accumulation\nmay also be necessary to maintain the root growth of\nsalinized plants. Although both WT and ABA-deficient\n(flacca) tomato plants showed a 50% reduction in root\nbiomass at 200 mM NaCl, reciprocal grafting experiments\nshowed that flacca scions with the same shoot biomass\nhad a much greater root biomass with a WT rootstock\nthan with a flacca rootstock (Chen et al., 2003). As in the\nshoot, it is possible that root growth of these ABA-\ndeficient rootstocks may have been inhibited by ethylene,\nsince transgenic canola plants containing ACC deaminase\n(Sergeeva et al., 2006) had greater root growth, although\nthis may be a consequence of improved shoot growth.\nWhile root ABA accumulation was apparently sufficient\nto limit root ACC concentration during the first two weeks\nof salinization (Fig. 5), a late increase in root ACC\nconcentration coincided with root growth inhibition.\nWhether this correlation is causative remains to be\ndetermined.\nLong-distance transport\nWhile local hormone concentrations can influence local\ngrowth processes in both roots and shoots, the extent to\nwhich a root-applied stress influences long-distance\nhormone signalling and thus shoot hormone status\nremains an ongoing research field (Dodd, 2005). Although\non some measurement occasions, for some hormones,\nFig. 7.

Fig. 3B,\nC) and root and shoot hormone concentrations for IAA\n(cf. Fig. 4A, B). While this correspondence between root\nand xylem hormone concentrations might suggest that the\nformer regulates the latter, the contributions of roots and\nshoots to xylem hormone concentrations can only be\nassessed by detailed flow modelling experiments (Jiang\nand Hartung, 2008) and\/or girdling to block phloem\ntransport to the roots and thus hormone recycling via the\nxylem (reviewed in Dodd, 2005).\nWhile the roots are the first to perceive the osmotic\ncomponent of saline stress, rapid loss of shoot turgor\nwithin minutes and hours (Munns, 2002) could alter shoot\nhormone concentrations (Pierce and Raschke, 1980).\nHowever, root pressurization during salinity revealed that\nleaf ABA accumulation was independent of shoot turgor\n(Kefu et al., 1991), but possibly induced by specific ions\nsuch as sodium, disproportionately to their osmotic\npressure (Montero et al., 1998). Nutrient relations may\nalso be involved in stress perception by the roots and CKs\nare considered long-distance signals mediating the shoot\nresponse to NO\u00013 availability in the roots (Beck, 1996;\nRahayu et al., 2005). Thus NO\u00013 =CI\n\u0001 antagonism at the\ntransport level (Kafkafi et al., 1982) may decrease root\nnitrate uptake and xylem loading (Cramer et al., 1995),\nand long-distance CK transport to limit shoot growth\nunder salinity. This idea is supported by observations that\nonly the most tolerant tomato genotypes were able to\nmaintain leaf nitrate concentration (Pe\u00b4rez-Alfocea et al.,\n1993), while deleterious effects of salinity can be\nalleviated by increasing NO\u00013 in the substrate (Grattan\nand Grieve, 1999). However, the contribution of xylem\nCK delivery to shoot CK status remains controversial\n(Dodd and Beveridge, 2006).\nConclusions\nFigure 9 summarizes the different hormonal and growth\nchanges induced by salinity in this study. Although much\nattention has been directed towards the role of the \u2018stress\nhormones\u2019 ABA and ACC in growth regulation, these do\nnot seem to be the primary factors controlling growth\nunder salinity, at least during the early (osmotic) phases of\nsalinity.
