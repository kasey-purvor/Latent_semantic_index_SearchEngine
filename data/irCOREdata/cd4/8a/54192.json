Introduction \nAs the composition of rural economies and approaches to rural development have \nchanged in recent decades, this paper seeks to identify the importance of education and work \nexperience among rural business owners.  Traditional rural enterprise was characterised by \nfamily succession and the importance of local knowledge and reputation but today, the variety \nof businesses operating in rural areas calls for different skills and knowledge.  Although \nobscured by net in-migration to rural areas, rural communities are losing a significant \nproportion of school-leavers who are unable to access suitable employment opportunities or \nfurther education locally (Stockdale, 2002; 2004).  The aim of this paper is to identify \nwhether this out-migration of human capital is compensated by the inward migration of \nindividuals who are able to introduce new human and social capital into the rural economy. \n \nGuided by results from a postal questionnaire survey of rural microbusinesses (see \nRaley and Moxey, 2000, for a detailed methodology and additional results), this research used \n40 qualitative interviews to explore the background of business owners and the way that \nprevious education, training and work experience influenced the subsequent development \ntrajectory of their businesses.  Within such a study, it was possible to compare and contrast \nbusiness owners in different sectors, those with different levels of formal education and those \nwho grew up locally or outside the area.  The data also allowed preliminary investigation into \nthe extent that knowledge and skills were transferred among actors in the rural economy \u2013 a \ncritical factor to address the contrasting hypotheses of whether local people with lower levels \nof education are marginalised by the in-migration of individuals with higher skills and \neducation levels or whether the increase in the average level of education provides \nopportunities and benefits to individuals who were previously marginalised by virtue of the \ncombination of peripherality and low skills. \n \n \n \n 3\n2.  The Changing Composition of the Rural Economy \nRural districts have experienced significant growth in small business numbers with an \nincrease of over 7% in the number of new businesses registering for VAT (or 37,000 per year) \nbetween 1995 and 2004.  This was marginally higher than the rate of increase in urban or \nmixed authorities (Commission for Rural Communities, 2007).  It is also estimated that some \n5 million people work in rural locations in England (Reuvid, 2003).  Although the national \neconomy is dominated by urban centres, some 28% of all small businesses are in rural areas \n(Department of Trade and Industry, 2005) compared to approximately 19% of the population.  \nRural businesses operate across a range of activities as the dominance of land-based sectors \nhas declined in recent decades.  Recent data suggests that the mix of rural businesses is not \ndissimilar to the national average and \u201cperhaps unexpectedly, in 2006 rural areas supported \nmore than the national share of workplaces in energy and utilities, construction, transport and \ncommunications and manufacturing\u201d (Commission for Rural Communities, 2008, p. 104). \n \nAs well as business growth, rural areas have experienced significant population \ngrowth over the past four decades with a shifting balance of the population away from urban \ncentres.  Champion (1989) defines this process of counterurbanisation as an inversion of the \ntraditionally positive relationship between migration and settlement size.  \nCounterurbanisation has traditionally been seen as a principally negative phenomenon being \naccused of increasing property prices to the disadvantage of indigenous residents (Gilligan, \n1987; Hamnett, 1992), reducing the potential viability of services (Divoudi and Wishardt, \n2004) and diminishing the sense of community (Bell, 1994). \n \nPrevious research (Bosworth, 2006; 2008a; 2008b) sought to provide a counter-\nargument to these views and discovered that inward flows of population are helping to \nstimulate the rural economy by creating new businesses and additional employment.  In-\nmigrants are more growth oriented and entering a diverse range of business sectors.  Other \nresearch has found new arrivals to be relatively affluent, often equipped with distinct \n 4\nattributes and networks of contacts and also much more successful in penetrating international \nmarkets (Kalantaridis and Bika, 2006).  Although not directly addressing the problems of \nyoung, educated individuals leaving rural areas (Stockdale, 2004), it is considered that rural \nin-migration can help to offset some of the problems and restore human and social capital in \nrural economies. \n \nIn the context of Neo-Endogenous Development, defined by Ray (2001, p. 4) as \n\u201cendogenous-based development in which extra-local factors are recognised and regarded as \nessential but which retains belief in the potential of local areas to shape their future\u201d, rural \nactors require the ability to influence local development and to generate extra-local \nconnectivity.  As Lin (2001) explained, the accessibility of valuable social capital is directly \nconnected to an individual\u2019s human capital resources.  In his view, the hierarchical nature of \nsocial capital makes individuals with higher education levels or higher skills more attractive \nand therefore more influential in business and social networks.  If this is true, the case for \nincreasing education and skills in the rural economy is clear but the potential for inequality is \nequally evident. \n \n \n3.  Education Levels in Rural Areas \nRural areas experience higher academic achievement in schools when measured in \nterms of GCSE grades (Commission for Rural Communities 2007, p. 48) but achievement is \nslightly lower in the more sparse areas.  This is in turn reflected in a higher propensity for \nrural school-leavers to attend university, resulting in the outflow of a high number of 18-21 \nyear olds.  Stockdale (2004) notes that rural out-migrants are highly qualified, employed in \nsecure and responsible positions, and earn in many cases substantially more than they could in \nthe donor community.  Policy aimed at retaining young people in rural areas would restrict \ntheir personal development opportunities so it appears that return migration back to rural \n 5\nareas (N\u00ed Laoire, 2007) or the inward migration of other individuals constitute increasingly \nimportant sources of entrepreneurship and skills for rural economies. \n \nFocusing on the adult population, census data indicates that in general, \u201cthere is a \nhigher incidence of top end qualifications such as university degrees (Level 4\u20135 and above) in \nrural areas and, correspondingly, a lower incidence of those without skills or qualifications\u201d \n(Commission for Rural Communities, 2005, p. 90)  A study in Wales confirmed this with a \nsurvey of the rural workforce showing that \u201crural areas have a lower proportion [of the \nworkforce] with no qualifications at 18.7% and 20.5% for males and females respectively \ncompared to 20.0% and 24.6% for the rest of Wales\u201d (Jones, 2003).   \n \nThe higher levels of education among rural populations are considered to be an \nadvantage for rural economies with Chell (2001, p. 270) reporting that \u201cthe more highly \neducated are more likely to found high growth businesses\u201d.  Littunen (2000) also refers to the \nimportance of previous work or entrepreneurial experience in the decision to become an \nentrepreneur.  Storey (1994, p. 64) provides further evidence with empirical work from \nAmerica which indicates that, ceteris paribus, \u201ceducational attainment levels are positively \nassociated with a move into self-employment\/new business formation.\u201d  A study by Westhead \nand Matlay (2006) advocates policies aimed at increasing human capital in the small business \nsector, either through graduate recruitment or lifelong skills development,  \n \nFounders of businesses in rural areas in the UK are generally more likely to have \nhigher educational qualifications that those in urban areas (Townroe and Mallalieu 1993).  \nWhile education levels are higher, the employment opportunities available in rural areas tend \nnot to require high-order skills with the result that, on average, in-migrants to rural areas \nmove to jobs with lower Standard Occupation Classifications (Groves-Phillips, 2008).  This \nmay be a further reason for the propensity for in-migrants to move into self employment on \nthe grounds that \u201clatent entrepreneurs will move into their own businesses when they reckon \n 6\nthe pay-off from employment to be greater than that afforded by their present position\u201d \n(Hamilton and Harper, 1994, p. 6). \n \nEarlier research in Northumberland (Bosworth, 2008a) found that, on average, in-\nmigrants had attained higher levels of education.  This suggests that counterurbanisation is \nhelping to maintain levels of human capital but adds further weight to arguments that rural in-\nmigration can be a divisive force for local communities.  Literature on the differentiated \ncountryside (Murdoch et al., 2003) places a strong emphasis on social divisions but this \nresearch explores the extent to which in-migrants are able to enhance rural economies through \ntheir business activities and embeddedness.  As Jack and Anderson (2002) explain, by \nbecoming part of the local structure, an embedded entrepreneur is able to draw upon and use \nresources and new entrepreneurial opportunities are created.  Also, as local knowledge can be \na \u201ckey factor of profitability\u201d (ibid, p. 469) in-migrants will be keen to become embedded and \nthrough this socio-economic process, it is hypothesised that opportunities arise for knowledge \nexchange, new trade and new networks which can all benefit the local economy. \n \n \n4.  Methodology \nA mixed methods approach was used whereby re-analysis of a survey of almost 1,300 \nrural microbusinesses provided the context for in-depth interviews with 40 rural \nmicrobusiness owners. The survey data provided important contextual data and a valuable \nsample group from which to explore deeper sociological processes.  Large scale surveys, \nhowever, only provide broadly categorised data so in depth interviews were essential for \neliciting the life stories and motivations of rural business owners.    These detailed stories \nwere critical to understanding how previous education and work experience were applied to \nthe activities of business owners and the benefits that were perceived at different points \nthrough the business start-up and development process. \n \n 7\nThe initial survey was conducted by former colleagues in the Centre for Rural \nEconomy at Newcastle University and included questions relating to education and \nprofessional qualifications, the use of business support and advisory services and many \naspects of business performance such as growth, employment, trade and turnover.  It also \nincluded questions that enabled the categorisation of local and in-migrant business owners, \nwith the latter being defined as those who had moved at least 30 miles to their current place of \nresidence during their adult lives. \n \nWhile statistical data can provide generalised results, the interviews add insights into \nhow issues such as education and work experience impact upon decisions to start a business \nand the ongoing running of a business.  The sample of 40 businesses was selected to comprise \na mix of those in the retail, business and domestic services, manufacturing and hospitality \nsectors as these were the four most populous sectors from the original survey.  These sectors \nalso included businesses that had combinations of more or less local and extra-local \ncustomers and suppliers. \n \nA flexible interview schedule was designed with questions that sought to follow the \nhistory of the business and business owner to understand how they had reached their current \nsituation.  This biographical approach encouraged interviewees to describe their stories and \nwhere critical moments arose, the researcher was able to probe into the motivations that lay \nbehind key decisions and the personal attributes that individuals required at each stage. \n \nThe mix of qualitative and quantitative data allows the analysis not only to identify \nstatistical results but also to explain some of the underlying reasons associated with personal \ndecisions and business development.  Additionally, the qualitative research enables \ninvestigation into the ways that information and expertise is shared among different business \nowners, providing a new insight into the networks that facilitate knowledge exchange in the \nrural economy. \n 8\n \n5.  Findings from the Microbusiness Survey \nHaving identified a broadening base of rural enterprise, the analysis in Table 1 shows \nthe education qualifications achieved by business owners in the main sectors identified in the \nsurvey.  With the concept of \u201cKnowledge Economies\u201d (Department of Trade and Industry, \n1998) gaining greater attention, certain business sectors are thought to have a greater \nimportance for local development and the data illustrates the importance of higher education \nin certain sectors, most notably the professional and domestic services sector.   \n \nTable 1 \nThe highest education qualification achieved by business owners in each of the main business \nsectors.* \n \nNumber \nof Firms \n16 or \nUnder \nGCSE or \nO-level \nA-Level or \nequivalent Diploma Degree \nPost-\ngraduate \nLand Based ** 61 27.9% 23.0% 6.6% 18.0% 13.1% 1.6% \nManufacturing 138 24.6% 14.5% 8.0% 18.8% 18.1% 3.6% \nConstruction 101 47.5% 20.8% 1.0% 21.8% 3.0% 1.0% \nRetail 310 31.0% 21.9% 7.7% 16.8% 9.0% 4.2% \nHospitality 271 20.3% 15.5% 8.5% 14.4% 17.3% 5.9% \nBusiness\/Domestic \nServices 201 11.9% 11.4% 2.5% 10.9% 20.4% 23.4% \nOther Services 193 11.3% 9.3% 4.7% 12.7% 24.0% 14.0% \n \n* Those business owners who selected an additional category of \u201cprofessional qualification\u201d as the \ntime at which they completed formal education are excluded from the analysis as they may or may not \nhave been to university and not all business sectors have professional qualifications. \n** The survey excluded farm businesses so these include other land-based activities \n \n \n \n 9\nThe survey data for the North East shows that over 25% of people who started their \nbusinesses had a degree compared to approximately 10% of those who took over through \nsuccession and 20% of those who purchased the business.  This confirms the findings of \nTownroe and Mallalieu (1993) indicating that education is an important factor associated with \nbusiness start-ups.  Despite other claims that education is associated with business \nperformance (Storey, 1994; Chell, 2001) the data showed no clear trends between a rural \nbusiness owner\u2019s education and their attitudes towards growth, their business turnover or job \ncreation.  There was also no significant difference in the mean number of jobs provided by \nbusiness owners with different levels of educational qualifications. \n \nIt was possible to elicit other conclusions about how education affects aspects of the \nbehaviour of business owners.  There was a very strong correlation between education and \nuse of the Internet which, as the original survey data is from 1999-2000, is considered a good \nproxy for the general adoption of new technology.  A further indication of education being \nassociated with forward-thinking business practices is that over 30% of businesses owners \nwith a degree or postgraduate qualification reported that they were keen to improve staff \ndevelopment compared to fewer than 16% of those with only school-based qualifications.  \nLeaving formal education at a later stage was also linked with a stronger willingness to \nparticipate in business networks.  These two factors indicate that other local employees and \nbusiness owners participating in networks will see benefits too. \n \nPrevious knowledge is considered to be highly valuable in the integration and \naccumulation of new knowledge and in adapting to new situations (Davidsson and Honig, \n2003) and this is supported by the fact that individuals with higher education qualifications \nwere more likely to engage with business support organisations.  Perhaps related to this, some \n25% of those with undergraduate or postgraduate degrees applied for grants compared to just \n16% of other business owners.  Those applicants with degrees were also marginally more \nsuccessful with 72% winning grants.   \n 10\n \nTable 2 \nComparing responses to the survey question \u201cHave you ever considered seeking business \nadvice?\u201d among business owners with different levels of education qualifications. \n \n \nNo \nGeneral \nBusiness \nAdvice \nSector \nSpecific \nAdvice \nBoth \n16 or Under 68.4% 17.6% 13.4% 0.7% \nGCSE\/O-level 53.7% 28.0% 17.8% 0.5% \nA-Level\/BTEC 38.5% 33.3% 24.4% 3.8% \nDiploma 38.8% 37.2% 17.3% 6.6% \nDegree 37.4% 38.5% 18.7% 5.3% \nPostgraduate 35.9% 37.9% 17.5% 8.7% \n \n \nTable 2 illustrates the fact that a longer time spent in education is associated with the \nuse of business advice.  The trend is less strong with sector specific advice suggesting that \nthis is learned through more formal channels of education but for more general advice, \neducation appears to enable and encourage engagement.  In-migrants are also more likely to \nhave sought business advice with almost 60% having considered either general or sector \nspecific advice compared to just over 40% of local business owners TPF1FPT, demonstrating that both \neducation and mobility are positively linked with business support and network participation. \n \nThose with degrees gave lower scores to the importance of local service provision \nand local employment creation but this is strongly associated with the fact that in-migrants are \nalmost three times more likely to have degrees than local business owners.  As well as being \nmore likely to have stayed in education for longer, in-migrants are also more likely to have a \n                                                          \nTP\n1\nPT A chi-square test confirms that these differences are significant to a 0.1% confidence level. \n 11\nprofessional qualification although the data does not indicate whether these are directly \nrelevant to the business that they are running.  With over 50% of local business owners not \nbeing educated beyond GCSEs or O-levels, the influx of new business owners is raising the \nlevels of human capital in the rural economy.   \n \n \nTable 3 \nComparing the stages at which local and in-migrant business-owners \ncompleted their formal education. \n \nOrigin GCSE or earlier \nA-level or \nequivalent Diploma \nProfessional \nqualification Degree \nPost-\ngraduate \nLocal 55.6% 6.5% 18.1% 10.3% 7.6% 1.9% \nIn-migrant 29.3% 5.7% 13.2% 17.7% 20.8% 13.4% \nPlanned Start-up 32.0% 6.5% 16.2% 15.5% 21.2% 8.6% \nUnplanned Start-up 27.0% 5.2% 11.3% 19.4% 20.6% 16.5% \n \n \nTable 3 confirms the above analysis with the bottom two rows distinguishing between \nthose in-migrants who moved with a clear intention to start a business (planned start-ups) and \nthose for whom self-employment was a later decision (unplanned start-ups).  We can see that \nbusiness owners who intended to start a business when they moved completed their formal \neducation earlier than the owners of unplanned start-ups and they are also less likely to have a \nprofessional qualification.  Initially we might think that those who are able to plan to start a \nbusiness would be better educated and that a professional qualification would be an advantage \nfor people planning to move and start their own business.  However, if we reverse the \ncausality, perhaps these statistics are actually telling us that educated people are moving to the \nNorth East to pursue further education or other employment and only after that does the \nopportunity arise to establish an independent business.   \n \n 12\nThis also raises the possibility that local people are being misrepresented if they move \naway for a period of time to pursue higher education.  To test this, the separate category of \nreturn migrant (those who grew up in the areas and returned in adult life) is introduced in \nTable 4.  With universities and urban employment taking people away from rural areas as \nwell as attracting new people into the region, return migration offers a potential benefit for \nrural areas whereby out-migrants leave to gain education and work experience and when they \nreturn they already possess some of the advantages of local knowledge and local networks.   \n \nTable 4 \nThe percentage of local, return and in-migrants leaving school before \nA-levels and the percentage attaining degrees \n \nCompletion of formal education \n  \nGCSE or \nearlier \nDegree or \npostgraduate \nLocal 55.6% 9.5% \nReturned 25.7% 26.5% \n In-migrant 29.9% 35.9% \n \nThis table demonstrates that return migrants who own rural microbusinesses are \nconsiderably more likely to have a degree compared to those who have always lived locally \nbut the fact that they still lag behind other in-migrants suggests that those brought up in the \nrural North East are disadvantaged in terms of accessing higher education.  The distinction \nbetween local and in-migrant business owners based on their education and qualifications is \nnot simply the result of local people who attend university subsequently being defined as \nmigrants.  It may be that higher educated local people are less likely to enter self-employment \nand are therefore not picked up by this survey but as small businesses are the lifeblood of \nrural economies (North West Development Agency, 2004; Federation of Small Businesses, \n2008), it is those entrepreneurs that run rural businesses that are considered the most \n 13\nimportant units of analysis in this study.  Having established that this difference exists, the \nfollowing sections seeks to explore the implications for rural businesses and the extent to \nwhich new forms of human capital are making a difference to businesses in the rural economy \nof the North East.   \n \n \n6.  The Importance of Education and Work Experience for Rural Business Owners \nAs noted by Politis (2008), the effect of prior start-up experience for entrepreneurs \nhas thus far been relatively under-researched.  His research discovered that previous \nexperience could overcome the liability of newness and change their attitudes and \nexpectations but this paper seeks to delve more deeply into the activities of business owners \nare influenced by their levels of education and work experience. \n \nFrom the biographical interviews, individuals\u2019 education and training appeared to \nimpact upon their business activity in three distinct ways.  The first is as an enabler of \nentrepreneurship, the second as the provider of essential business skills and the third as the \nprovider of learning and networking skills.  In this section, each of these three points is \nexplained with the use of examples from the interviews before the concluding section \nexplores the extent to which these attributes are transferable and the extent to which skills \nmay be developed in other ways, outside of formal education or employment.  \n \n \n6.1  Enabling Entrepreneurship \nFrom the literature we have already seen that education is positively associated with \nbusiness formation.  In the previous section, the statistical findings also confirmed that those \npeople starting a rural business were more likely to have a degree compared to those buying \nor taking over an existing business.  Given that education is also positively linked to salaries, \nthe opportunity cost associated with self-employment among higher educated individuals will \n 14\nbe higher that among those individuals with lower levels of education (Shane, 2003).  This \nsection therefore explores the entrepreneurial attributes and opportunities that are provided by \nhigher levels of education and work experience that encourage or enable this group of \nbusiness owners to run their own businesses. \n \nFor some business sectors, professional qualifications are a barrier to entry but once \nthe business owner has these qualifications, they are in a privileged position where the \nnumber of competitors is limited.  The accrual of experience in that business sector during the \nlearning phase will provide both the requisite business knowledge as well as the skills to do \nthe work.  With these attributes, an individual is well placed to identify a business opportunity \nand to turn that opportunity into reality.  Examples may include a range of businesses and \ninterviews illustrated that this covered a variety of business sectors.  One business was run by \na couple who each took a catering course and subsequently bought premises to realise their \nprofessional ambitions, a second was run by photographers who met studying their art at \nuniversity, and others included property and business consultants with professional \nqualifications or a specific masters degree. \n \nFor other individuals, high educational attainment enables them to fast-track their \ncareers.  One interviewee explained that after taking a postgraduate degree, he was able to \nenter the teaching profession at a more senior level than other colleagues and this resulted in \nhim becoming a head-master at a relatively young age.  Once in that position, the \nadministrative work became a greater burden and a ceiling had been reached where any \nfurther career progression would have resulted in fewer teaching hours.  In his words, \u201cby the \ntime you\u2019re a head teacher you have nothing to do with the classroom, largely you\u2019re \ninvolved with administration so I decided that if I was going to do admin I\u2019d rather do it in \nmy own business and have the freedom to be where I wanted to be when I wanted to be rather \nthan carry on teaching.\u201d  Rather than pursue a career that was becoming less attractive, he \ntook the opportunity to develop an independent business in his spare time and once he was \n 15\nconfident that it would succeed, he was able to run the business full time.  Without the job \nsecurity and contacts that he developed as a teacher, the start-up would have been \nsignificantly riskier and without the personal and financial status, the prospects of success \nmay also have been slimmer.   \n \nOther examples of how education and work experience can facilitate entrepreneurship \ncome from early retirees and pre-retirement in-migrants (Green, 2006) who subsequently \nrecognise opportunities to pursue business interests.  Without the financial pressures of \nhaving to earn a living, those in early retirement or semi-retirement are able to tackle new \nprojects or expand their hobbies into business activities.  Examples from the North East \nregion include a brewery which is run by a retired computer engineer and a bed and breakfast \nrun by a couple where one had been in the police force and the other a teacher.  Had they not \nhad successful careers behind them, they may not have had the financial capital, business \nacumen or the time to develop these enterprises.  These were both examples where the \nbusiness owner had previously worked in nearby cities but a third example comes from a \nfarmer\u2019s wife with extra time on her hands after her children had grown up.  She said \u201cI just \nneeded something else for myself to do\u201d and as she had always enjoyed baking, when the \nlocal tea-room came up to rent, it was an obvious step.  Rural areas are seeing increasing \nnumbers of pre-retirement entrepreneurs and although in some cases, older business owners \nhave less ambition for growth, this business has relocated to larger premises, employs up to \n20 staff in peak season and attracts significant numbers of visitors into a small village.  The \nowners of these three businesses had no formal education beyond A-levels but the ubiquity of \nuniversity education is a more recent phenomenon and computer engineers and teachers today \nwould be expected to have degrees. \n \nThe importance of education as an enabler of entrepreneurship is well advertised by a \nlocal business owner.  After completing an undergraduate degree and finding few appealing \ncareer options, he had an ambition to establish a specific manufacturing business.  He knew \n 16\nthat this would require some specialist knowledge so he enrolled on a masters course some 30 \nmiles away and used that year to built up the necessary contacts as well as the business \nknowledge to reach the position where, with family support, he was able to acquire a property \nand develop the business.  While in-migrants may arrive with certain attributes, this \ndemonstrates that local entrepreneurs often have to make greater efforts to achieve similar \nambitions.  A further example was presented by a farmer who uses the farm assets as the basis \nfor a variety of diversified activities, many of which he acknowledges would not have been \npossible without the networks of friends and professional advisers that he developed by taking \na masters degree.  In each case it was the contacts and confidence rather than specific \nbusiness skills that enabled the entrepreneurs to follow their chosen career paths.  \n \nThe importance of universities for regional development has been the subject of \nincreasing academic interest (Ward et al., 2005) and as well as spin out firms and knowledge \ntransfer initiatives, universities are also able to attract new entrepreneurs into a region.  While \nlocal people may have to seek out appropriate education and training courses elsewhere, other \ngraduates may enter the local community as a result of migration associated with higher \neducation.  One such business owner was attracted to the North East to attend university \nbefore working in the city for a short time, marrying a local girl and subsequently taking over \nhis father-in-law\u2019s manufacturing business.  This, and other examples of individuals \nrelocating to the region to take urban-based employment before a subsequent counter-\nurbanising move, are clear examples of the importance of urban centres for the supply of rural \nentrepreneurs and education is a significant factor in the mobility of these individuals. \n \nA further example of the impact of education on a rural microbusiness comes from a \nmarketing consultancy that was initially run from home by one person.  She explained that the \ndecision to work from home was twofold: it was much cheaper to work from home and she \nwanted to have a dog.  This was in essence a lifestyle business which would provide a stable \nincome until retirement but once her son had graduated and joined the business, they \n 17\nrelocated to new premises and have continued to widen the range of services and expand their \nclient base and staff numbers.  The migration of individuals with extra-local, usually urban-\nbased, experiences can be highly significant for a variety of businesses.  As an example, a \nfarm diversification business was aided by the involvement of the farmer\u2019s father-in-law who \nhad taken early retirement from a financial career and his skills have helped to establish a \nsuccessful new business.   \n \nEach of these examples demonstrates that for the majority of rural business owners, \ngrowth trajectories are related to their previous education or employment, or that of close \nassociates within the firm.  By contrast, the rural businesses that are struggling in the modern \nrural economy tend to be those whose owners have less external networks and fewer \nexperiences beyond the local area.  As the statistics showed, retail and land-based activities, \nwhich might dominate the traditional image of rural business (Horton, 2008), tend to be \nowned by individuals who left formal education at an earlier stage.  Of course, there are many \nfactors influencing the decline of traditional rural activity, from external forces such as \nsupermarkets taxation and regulation, to changing lifestyles and individual preferences and to \nthe influence of land and property markets but an owners\u2019 lack of connections and \nexperiences beyond the local area can be a factor in the vulnerability of some of these \nbusinesses. \n \n \n6.2  Providing Business Skills \nAs well as providing the opportunity to take up entrepreneurial opportunities, we must \nalso explore the extent to which education and work experience help business owners to \nsurvive and hopefully grow their businesses.  Almost any research into business owners tends \nto focus on those still in business, so there is an automatic success bias (Chell and Baines, \n2000; Davidsson and Honig, 2003) but it is still possible to elicit the key business skills that \nare recognised by business owners as well as areas where they felt that their skills were \n 18\ninadequate.  Several interviewees commented that certain aspects of running a business \ncannot be taught.  One made the following observation:  \n \n\u201cThe problem is, you start out with one then two people and the office grows but \nnobody\u2019s ever sat down with me and said this is how a modern office is run, I\u2019m \nnot sure you can get advice on that \u2026 you have to learn yourself and you make \nmistakes\u201d \n \nA second interviewee commented that: \n\u201cI think that\u2019s the main thing that every business is lacking, there\u2019s no-one to \ncome and help you or show you\u2026everything I\u2019ve learnt I\u2019ve just stumbled \nthrough and learnt myself because you have to keep going. If I did something that \nwas wrong, I just had to start again and try it another way. Sometimes you think I \nwish somebody could come out and help us.\u201d \n \nIn these two examples, the first interviewee had a degree and the second had no \neducation qualifications so it appears that certain elements of running a business are only \nlearned by experience, regardless of education.  Other interviewees commented on the need \nfor a wider range of skills to run a business.  Rather than just taking photographs for clients or \ncooking and serving food for guests, there are accounting requirements, staffing issues and \nother bureaucracy that demand the attention of business owners.  In some cases these are \nskills that can be taught or hired in via consultants but in many cases the business owner will \nstill learn by experience. \n \nBusiness owners mentioned several other more obvious applications of education and \nthese included use of the Internet, report writing skills, business planning, financial \nawareness, technical knowledge and accounting skills.  The owner of a family business \nhighlighted the fact that these skills may also be introduced through other individuals.  He \n 19\nexplained, \u201cThe Internet\u2019s very important, my sons heavily involved in that\u2026He\u2019s been to \nuniversity so he\u2019s very clued up on that sort of thing.\u201d   \n \nWhen applying for a grant, another business owner compared the process of writing \nthe bid to working on a university dissertation and said that he felt his education certainly \nhelped.  In many cases these are specific personal skills but the increasingly diverse range of \nbusinesses and especially the spread of professional services firms are enabling the spread of \nnew skills.  A further example demonstrating the transfer of skills and knowledge comes from \na business owner in the manufacturing sector.  His company has a high proportion of exports \nand he felt that he was educating other local service providers such as his bank and his \naccountant who were unaccustomed to dealing with exporting businesses.   \n \nAs well as personal skills, education can enhance the reputation of a business.  As one \nbusiness owner commented, she continues to attend courses because the certificates enhance \nthe reputation of her business.  In this example the information or skills that might have been \nlearned appeared to be very much of secondary importance.  For other business owners, \nprevious work in computing, marketing and accounting all provided directly applicable skills \nthat enabled them to manage and develop their businesses.  Principally, however, the most \nvaluable skill acquired from education seemed to be flexibility.  Where markets change, \nclients or suppliers are lost or new technology arrives, business owners need the skills to \nadapt and re-assess their situation.  One interviewee described how the business plan factored \nin a certain core client group that never materialised and this led them down a route where \nthey had far less experience but this was compensated by the ability to adapt and quickly \nlearn enough to get by.  Small firms are thought to benefit from flexibility in their \norganisational structures (Power and Reid 2005) but the ability of key decision makers is also \nessential if this flexibility can result in the exploitation of new opportunities. \n \n 20\nWith a growing emphasis on the potential for \u201cknowledge economies\u201d to develop in \nrural areas, the transfer of these skills is essential.  A knowledge economy is defined by the \nDepartment of Trade and Industry (1998, p. 2) as \u201cone in which the generation and the \nexploitation of knowledge has come to play the predominant part in the creation of wealth\u201d so \nthe trend of educated in-migrants moving to rural areas and engaging with rural economies \ncan be seen to contribute to this.  For a sustainable \u201cknowledge economy\u201d to develop, \nhowever, these attributes need to become a part of the rural economy that is also accessible to \nlocal people and concurrently, in-migrants need to accrue local knowledge from participation \nin local networks and the next section explores this in more detail by examining the \nimplications of education and work experience for the networking behaviour of business \nowners. \n \n \n6.3  Enhancing Networking and Learning Skills \nWhile certain direct skills are learned in education and more so through the course of \nwork experience, perhaps the most significant advantages are those associated with personal \nskills such as communication and confidence.  As well as learning how to learn (Weick, \n1996), exposure to education makes individuals more comfortable in a learning environment.  \nThose will fewer qualifications are less likely to consider attending courses or networking \nevents.  Publicly they may ascribe this to a strong independent attitude but the reality may \ninclude an underlying lack of confidence or a lack of knowledge about the people or the ways \nin which the course is run. \n \nThe statistical data confirmed that higher education qualifications were associated \nwith higher levels of networking and use of business advice services.  Clear examples from \nthe interviews included the owner of a new business who said, \u201cWe targeted these formal \nnetworks, we didn\u2019t know what else to do.  We didn\u2019t have any contacts, we didn\u2019t know \nwhich networks would be best so in the first year we just went to all of them and then decided \n 21\nwhich to stick with.\u201d  Another explained that \u201cno problem is unassailable, if you\u2019ve got the \nright network you can up the phone and get it sorted\u201d. This individual also talked about the \nneed to \u201cplay the system\u201d saying \u201cnobody\u2019s better than me\u201d.  This confidence in dealing with \nformal systems and developing beneficial networks is not shared by all business owners.    \n \nFor those who are less familiar with learning and networking arenas, more common \nsentiments include, \u201cIf we turn up to an event, you get more out of the chat over the bar than \nanything else.\u201d When asked about networking, another replied, \u201cI don\u2019t do it\u2026I don\u2019t really \nhave to do it\u2026I know the people who come in the shop and just communicate with them as \nand when.\u201d  A third business owner initially commented that networking \u201cis something to do \nwith computers\u201d but further questioning revealed that she was a very strong communicator \nwith her customers and suppliers.  Each of these demonstrate that business owners have \ncertain comfort zones where networking is a part of their daily life but for business owners \nwith exposure to more diverse learning and work experiences, they tend to be comfortable in \na wider range of more formal settings. \n \nThis is not to say that all experienced and educated people are avid networkers.  The \nfollowing two quotes come from business owners in the manufacturing and professional \nservices sectors respectively. \n \n\u201cIn the early days I used to go to these networking lunches, the first thing you \nrealise is that three-quarters of the people there are from government agencies \njustifying each others jobs and departments.  Because we don\u2019t particularly sell \nin this area or this country and the raw materials we need we can\u2019t get from this \narea, it didn\u2019t work for us.\u201d \n \n\u201cSomeone tried to get us involved in a business network club a few months \nback\u2026and they were on at us all the time, it was 6 o\u2019 clock in the morning you\u2019ve \n 22\ngot to go to these things and a guy came in to see us about doing some web \ndesign and saw the card on the table and he said \u201cyou\u2019re not doing that are \nyou?\u201d we said we\u2019d been thinking about it but he said you can\u2019t get sucked into \nit, if you go once you\u2019ve got to go every week and it\u2019s like no way we could go \nevery week, our work changes day to day, it\u2019s not like its 9-5, this time next week \nwe might be in Manchester, here in Edinburgh\u2026a weekly thing isn\u2019t something \nwe could stick to so we never went.\u201d  \n \nIn each case, the owner has a degree, considerable business experience and confidence \nin dealing with a diversity of clients.  Because of the nature of their business, however, they \nrecognise that these networking opportunities are not advantageous.  Despite the final \ndecision not to participate in these networks, they have been open-minded and considered the \nopportunities.  By contrast, a business owner who had worked for many years in employment \nbefore setting up independently had less experience of networking and commented \u201cI\u2019ve \nalways resisted it, I hated the thought of it\u2026I probably should have done more of it as I\u2019m not \ngetting as much business now.\u201d  In a bigger company, it is possible to avoid using or \ndeveloping certain skills but this example illustrates how a self-employed entrepreneur \nrequires a full complement of skills to maximise their potential growth.  As Minniti and \nLevesque (2008) explain, entrepreneurs must be \u2018jacks of all trades\u2019 with the ability to \nperform many tasks.  \n \nWhere a business owner lacks skills, these can often be overcome with strong support \nnetworks.  The presence of other entrepreneurs in networks of social relationships can also \nreduce the ambiguity associated with entrepreneurial activity (Minniti, 2005).  Not all \nbusiness owners have access to networks that are rich in human capital or entrepreneurial \nability.  An in-migrant business owner in a small village characterised by a strong local \ncommunity has been able to bridge this gap.  Her outward-looking attitude takes her to \nregional network meetings and training course and through this activity she has been able to \n 23\nintroduce other local business owners to business advice providers.  This individual is also \nmore familiar with the Internet and has helped to advertise a range of local businesses, \nrecognising the potential benefits of drawing in a higher number of visitors to the village.  \nThis charitable behaviour has helped the business to become embedded with the business \nowner and her family quickly accepted into the local community.  \n \nThis example demonstrates the potential advantages that a local business community \ncan gain from the introduction of new entrepreneurs with different education, experiences and \nattitudes.  Initially, the above example may seem unusually charitable but for many in-\nmigrants the desire to be accepted into the local community does lead to active local \nnetworking.  A couple who bought a guesthouse explained that they were always keen to \nrecommend other guesthouses in the local area at times when they were full and this was \nquickly reciprocated by the other members of the local community.  A couple establishing a \nrestaurant were also keen to get to know other members of the local business community and \nthrough the development of social relations in this way, business owners will exchange ideas \nand knowledge and support other local businesses in ways that develop both human and \nsocial capital in the local area.  \n \nThis section has sought to explain how both education and work experience convey a \nconfidence and a familiarity with networking behaviour and knowing how to learn, where to \naccess training and having the desire to engage with information providers are all \ncharacteristics that are beneficial for business owners (Davidsson and Honig, 2003).  \nFurthermore, there were many indications from the research that individuals with these \ncharacteristics are engaging with local communities as well as wider and more formal \nnetworking organisations.  Future research might seek to explore this element in more detail \nto understand the extent of local knowledge transfer that occurs between business owners in \norder to address the question of whether in-migrants are marginalising individuals with lower \nlevels of education and work experience or whether they are helping to reduce \n 24\nmarginalisation.  Early indications from the North East, however, are positive, suggesting that \nlocal employment creation, local trade and the development of local social relations are all \nhelping to raise levels of human capital across the rural economy. \n \nLin (2001) suggests that social capital is hierarchical and therefore individuals with \nhigher levels of human capital will tend to participate in networks of like-minded people and \naspire to access networks that are higher up the hierarchy.  This would suggest that the most \neducated and those who have had the most success in business would be unlikely to engage in \nlocal networking groups.  Where networking is a purely business decision, this has sometimes \nbeen true.  One business owner explained, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019d be any point in us being in \nthe local chamber of trade, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019ve got a shop on the High Street or anybody \nwould seek our opinion about trading here\u201d.  Another in-migrant commented \u201cthere is a \nnetworking group\u2026which I have been to a couple of times but realistically there is little \nchance of working with any of the local companies.\u201d  Even in these examples, however, the \nstrong significance of the local community is evident.  The first quote shows a consideration \nof whether other businesses would benefit and later spoke of the importance of supporting \nlocal businesses and knowing reliable local tradespeople.  The second interviewee continued \nto explain that they sponsor local events and work with a local school because they recognise \nthe importance of their local reputation, even though their trade is almost entirely outside the \nregion.   \n \nWhile social capital can be hierarchical in some environments, it appears that rural \nbusiness owners are more influenced by their local communities and for them to access local \nsocial capital requires the recognition of certain obligations towards that local community.  \nGiven that the community is important outside of work, especially for those business owners \nwhose location choice was influenced by perceptions of rural lifestyles, it is clear that the \nprocess of embedding gives rise to the opportunities for valuable knowledge transfer and \nsupport among rural businesses. \n 25\n \n7.  Conclusions \nThis research has sought to ease concerns over the loss of educated young people \nfrom rural communities by providing evidence of the human capital attached to in-migrant \nbusiness owners.  With statistics illustrating that in-migrants are considerably more likely to \nhave stayed in full-time education for longer, they are raising the average levels of education \nin the rural business community.  This alone, however, was considered an insufficient \nconclusion because it raised a further question concerning the potential marginalisation of \nlocal people with lower levels of education qualifications and less advanced or diverse work \nexperiences.   \n \nEducation provides a variety of opportunities and skills that relate to self-\nemployment.  For many business-owners, achievements in previous employment are essential \nto develop the necessary experience and contacts to support a nascent entrepreneurial venture.  \nThereafter, the ability to learn and be flexible and having knowledge and skills relating to \ntheir specific business activity are all highly valuable human capital resources.  Moreover, \nwith this human capital comes the advantage that other business owners are keen to build both \npersonal and economic relations which in turn provide access to wider stocks of social capital.   \n \nThis was reflected in the statistics which showed that business owners with higher \neducation qualifications were the most likely to have used a variety of business advice and \nnetworking organisations.  Their engagement with private sector advice services, Chambers \nof Commerce and other contacts in industry, lends weight to the notion that attracting greater \nnumbers of more highly educated business owners into rural economies can foster a culture of \nenterprise with the potential to support other local business activity.  On average, both in-\nmigrants and business owners with higher education qualifications are conducting the \nmajority of their trade at the local and regional levels and interviewees indicated a strong \ndesire to become embedded, both personally and for their businesses.  Overall, in the rural \n 26\nNorth East, such findings lead to the conclusion that the in-migration of business owners with \nhigh levels of education is benefiting the local economy. \n \nAs more and more people are encouraged to stay on at school and attend universities, \neducational differences may diminish but for the majority of rural people, they have to leave \nthe area in order to go to university and then there are often few jobs in rural area that are \nsuitable for new graduates if they wish to return.  This may not be a problem for the graduate \nbut in the community left behind the lack of younger people may be of greater concern.  As \nrural businesses are growing and encompassing a wider range of activities, it is hoped that \nthere will be higher demand for skilled employees which will see rural wages increase and \nprovide opportunities for younger people, whether school-leavers or graduates, to stay in their \nlocalities and secure rewarding jobs or develop new enterprises in a vibrant local economy.  If \nnot, at least the in-migrants that replenish rural communities can continue to sustain the rural \neconomy through their employment creation, business formation and local trade. \n \nFrom a theoretical point of view, this research has illustrated the value of mobility for \nthe development of human capital.  It also supports Lin\u2019s (2001) assertion that access to social \ncapital is related to an individual\u2019s human capital assets.  Whether \u201cpurposively\u201d or \n\u201cpassively\u201d, business owners are becoming embedded into their local rural communities and \nthis is creating new opportunities for knowledge transfer and the introduction of new human \ncapital assets.  As Jack and Anderson recognise, the exchange of both local and extra-local \nknowledge is highly valuable for businesses and \u201cembedding provides a mechanism for \nbridging structural holes in resources and for filling information gaps\u201d (2002, p469).  This \nresearch has illustrated that personality mobility is a key facilitator of such knowledge \nexchanges. \n \n Chell and Baines (2000) refer to the increased potential for business success if their \nowners are alert to business opportunities.  Through both education and work experience and \n 27\nthrough the education and experiences of friends and acquaintances, higher levels of human \nand social capital, enhanced by greater personal mobility, are contributing to the economic \ndevelopment of the rural economy.  Further studies into the particular interfaces where \nrelationships develop and knowledge is exchanged can enable us to better understand the \nspecific needs of rural businesses as well as the direct benefits that are realised from both \nembeddedness and increased contact with extra-local economies.  This is only possible, \nhowever, with a clear understanding of the new mobilities and processes of embeddedness \nthat now exist in rural areas. \n \n 28\nReferences \n \nBell, M.
