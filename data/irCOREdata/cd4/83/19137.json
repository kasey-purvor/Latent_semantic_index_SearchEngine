INTRODUCTION\nThe presentation made by Augustus Bozzi Granville to\nthe Fellows of the Royal Society (Granville 1825) was\nthe culmination of a study that had aroused great public\ninterest and laid the foundations of the scientific study\nof ancient Egyptian mummies. Earlier descriptions of\nmummies, attempts to describe the wrappings and\nmaterials used in mummification and the exterior state\nof the human remains, were fully reviewed by Granville.\nHowever, he was fortunate to gain access to a particularly\nwell-preserved specimen (figure 1a,b) and had the pre-\nrequisite medical knowledge to take full advantage of this\nopportunity. The mummy, from the necropolis of\nThebes, was of the lady Irtyersenu, of the 26th Dynasty,\ndated to ca 600 BC (Hedges et al. 1997). After detailed\nobservations of the wrappings and the exterior features\nof the mummy, Granville decided to perform a detailed\n(but destructive) autopsy. As he stated (Granville 1825,\np. 281):Having proceeded thus far into my inquiry into the state\nof preservation of the mummy before me, I determined,r for correspondence (h.donoghue@ucl.ac.uk).\nic supplementary material is available at http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.\nb.2009.1484 or via http:\/\/rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org.\n15 August 2009\n8 September 2009 1perfect and beautiful as it was, to make it the object of\nfurther research by subjecting it to the anatomical knife,\nand thus to sacrifice a most complete specimen of the\nart of Egyptian embalming, in hopes of eliciting some\nnew facts illustrative of so curious and interesting a\nsubject;Granville, who was an eminent physician and obstetri-\ncian, observed that the mummy was that of a woman\naged around 50, who had been corpulent. She showed\nsigns of what we now recognize as osteoporosis, but of par-\nticular interest was a mass around the right ovary, which\nGranville described as \u2018ovarian dropsy\u2019 or cancer and led\nto his conclusion that this was the cause of death. However,\nmore recent studies (Strouhal 1976; Nunn & Tapp 2000)\nsuggest that this was a benign cystadenoma of the ovary,\nwhich would not have been fatal.\nThe residual organs and bones of the Granville\nmummy were displayed in a wooden cabinet, which is\nnow in the British Museum in London. Further studies\nwere carried out in 1994 and subsequent years, which\nare described in a book due to be published by the British\nMuseum Press (Harer & Taylor in press). The histological\nstudies of the mummy tissues mentioned above noted a\npotentially fatal pathological condition\u2014a pulmonary\nexudate (Tapp in press). In an attempt to determine the\ncause of death, further investigations were carried out.This journal is q 2009 The Royal Society\n(a) (b)\nFigure 1. The original appearance of the Granville mummy. (a) Inner coffin lid; (b) unwrapped mummy (Granville 1825).\n2 H. D. Donoghue et al. Molecular examination of Granville mummy\n on July 17, 2010rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from In one of these, tissue from the Granville mummy\nwas tested using the ParaSight-F-test for Plasmodium\nfalciparum histidine-rich protein-2. A positive finding\nsuggested that the lady Irtyersenu was suffering from\nuntreated P. falciparum malaria when she died (Miller\net al. 1994). However, it was subsequently discovered\nthat this test gives false-positive reactions in the presence\nof serum rheumatoid factor (Laferl et al. 1997; Bianucci\net al. 2008). During the early 1990s, several attempts\nwere made to detect microbial or human DNA from the\nGranville mummy by PCR. These remain unpublished\nas negative results were obtained and investigators con-\ncluded that the extracts were strongly inhibitory to\nDNA amplification. As part of a broader study on histori-\ncal and ancient malaria, a subsequent attempt to detect\nP. falciparum DNA from the Granville mummy was\ninconclusive (Taylor et al. 1997).\nTuberculosis has long been recognized in Egyptian\nmummies by palaeopathological changes, such as Pott\u2019s\ndisease, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA\nhas been detected and characterized from the Predynastic\nera (Crube\u00b4zy et al. 1998), the Old, Middle and New\nKingdoms (Nerlich et al. 1997; Zink et al. 2003a). There-\nfore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the\nlady Irtyersenu had evidence of tuberculosis in her\ntissues, which may have been her cause of death. Because\nof the reported difficulty of obtaining amplifiableProc. R. Soc. BDNA from this mummy, an additional method was\nused: the direct detection of specific cell-wall mycolic\nacid biomarkers of the M. tuberculosis complex, using\nhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nThis has been used previously to confirm cases of tuber-\nculosis indicated by M. tuberculosis complex DNA\n(Donoghue et al. 1998; Gernaey et al. 2001) and the tech-\nnique has recently been refined and increased in\nsensitivity, thereby permitting the direct detection and\nquantification of M. tuberculosis complex mycolic acid\nderivatives in human remains 9000 years old (Hershkovitz\net al. 2008).2. MATERIAL AND METHODS\n(a) Samples\nSamples taken in the early 1990s were available\u2014lung tissue,\nand bone from the left and right femurs and the hand of\nthe Granville mummy. In addition, additional samples were\ncollected from the lung, gall bladder and soft tissues that\nmay be of pleura or diaphragm. Samples were examined\nindependently at UCL (DNA analysis) and University of\nBirmingham (cell-wall mycolic acid biomarkers).\n(b) Precautions against contamination\nThe recommended protocols of ancient DNA (aDNA)\nwork (O\u2019Rourke et al. 2000; Donoghue & Spigelman 2006;\nlanes: 1 2 3\n92 bp\n4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\nFigure 2.

Donoghue et al. 3\n on July 17, 2010rspb.royalsocietypublishing.orgDownloaded from Taylor et al. in press) were followed. In brief, samples were\nprocessed in laboratories where no work with modern\nM. tuberculosis has ever been performed. There was strict sep-\naration of work areas between DNA extraction, PCR set-up,\nnested and post-PCR procedures using different laboratories,\ndemarcated by labels, colour of laboratory coats and backed\nup by staff training. Within laboratories, strict guidelines\nwere followed regarding cleaning and non-sharing of equip-\nment. Dedicated sets of pipettes were used for PCR set-up\nand were stripped and cleaned in detergent and ethanol\nbefore each experiment. Fresh sterile filter tips were used\nroutinely. Surfaces and equipment in contact with sample\ntubes (centrifuges, rotors, mixers, etc.) were cleaned before\neach assay and use of sterile and pre-purchased reagents\nminimized contamination risk.\n(c) DNA extraction\nDNA extraction procedures have been described previously\n(Donoghue et al. 2005). Three separate extractions were\nperformed (electronic supplementary material, table S1). In\nbrief, approximately 25 mg of sample was pre-incubated in\nProteinase K\/EDTA at 568C for 24\u201372 h. Owing to the\nreported difficulty of obtaining amplifiable DNA from this\nmaterial, an aliquot from each sample was treated with\n0.1 M N-phenacylthiazolium bromide, a reagent that cleaves\nglucose-derived protein cross-links (Poinar et al. 1998).\nThereafter, all samples were lysed in guanidium thiocyanate\nsolution at 568C (Boom et al. 1990) and vigorously mixed\nwith small glass beads to release any mycobacterial DNA.\nDNA was captured onto silica by using spin columns\n(DNeasy tissue kit, Qiagen Ltd). After washing and drying,\nDNA was eluted from the silica, aliquoted and used immedi-\nately or stored at 2208C. Negative extraction controls were\nalways included.\n(d) DNA amplification and detection\nThe M. tuberculosis complex was detected by targeting a\nspecific region of the repetitive element IS6110 (Eisenach\net al. 1990; Hellyer et al. 1996). A two-tube nested PCR\nwas used, which yielded an outer product of 123 bp and a\nnested PCR product of 92 bp (Spigelman & Lemma 1993;\nTaylor et al. 1996). The PCR mix included 10 mM bovine\nserum albumin to reduce PCR inhibition (Forbes & HicksProc. R. Soc. B1996; Abu Al-Soud & Ra\u02dadstro\u00a8m 2000). A 50 ml reaction\nmix was used with 5 ml of DNA extract. Tenfold dilutions\nof DNA extract were also tested to reduce any inhibition.\nIn a parallel set of experiments, 1 M betaine was included\nin the PCR mix as a facilitator (Weissensteiner & Lanchbury\n1996). A hot-start Taq polymerase was used to minimize\nnon-specific primer and template binding. Negative controls\nwere always included. PCR product was detected by staining\nwith ethidium bromide and visualized under ultraviolet light.\nIn order to characterize the predominant DNA molecule,\ndirect sequencing of the whole PCR amplicon was performed\nby MWG-BIOTECH AG (Ebersberg, Germany).\n(e) Mycolic acid derivatization and high-performance\nliquid chromatography analysis\nExtracts of a stored lung tissue sample taken previously\n(sample 1: 29.6 mg), a new lung sample (sample 2:\n69.9 mg) and combined left and right femurs (71.2 mg)\nwere analysed by HPLC for mycolic acids. The detailed proto-\ncols have been described previously (Hershkovitz et al. 2008).\nIn brief, samples were hydrolysed and long-chain fatty acids\nderivatized to pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters by established\nprocedures (Minnikin et al. 1993). PFB mycolate fractions\nwere isolated using normal phase cartridges and reacted with\npyrenebutyric acid (PBA) to give PBA\u2013PFB-derivatized\nmycolates, which, after standard clean-up procedures, were\nexamined by reverse-phase HPLC for profiles similar to stan-\ndard M. tuberculosis. It has been established that modern\ntuberculosis can be diagnosed by recognition of a very charac-\nteristic reverse-phase HPLC profile of mycolic acids, shown by\nmembers of the M. tuberculosis complex (Butler & Guthertz\n2001). Such a diagnosis was reinforced by use of the\nnormal-phase HPLC to separate the individual alpha-,\nmethoxy- and keto-mycolates, followed by reverse-phase\nHPLC of each of these components, as demonstrated\npreviously for modern (Minnikin et al. 1993) and ancient\nC76\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nC78C80C82\nC83\nC85\nC85\nC87\nC87\nC89\nC89\nC91\nC84 lung sample 1\nlung sample 2\nfemurs\nM. tuberculosis \nstandard\nblank\nlung sample 1\nlung sample 2\nfemurs\nM. tuberculosis \nstandard\nblank\nlung sample 1\nlung sample 2\nfemurs\nlung sample 1keto-\n?\nmethoxy-\nalpha-\nlung sample 2\nfemurs\nM. tuberculosis standard\nblank\n0 5 10 15 20 25\nmin\nFigure 4.

DNA from the M. tuberculosis complex\nwas detected in the lung samples, gall bladder and mem-\nbranous tissues (possibly pleura and diaphragm) but\nresults were inconsistent (electronic supplementary\nmaterial, table S2). Additional characterization of the\nDNA was not attempted as previously positive DNA\nextracts lost activity after freezing and thawing, indicating\nthe fragility of the DNA. A positive result from the orig-\ninal lung tissue is shown on an agarose gel (figure 2).\nDNA sequences were obtained from the nested PCR pro-\nducts of the original lung sample, gall bladder and\npossible diaphragm, which were homologous with that\nin the NCBI database (electronic supplementary\nmaterial, fig. S1a\u2013c).\nThe HPLC results for the analysis of extracts of com-\nbined left and right femurs and a new lung sample are\nshown in reverse-phase (figure 3), normal-phase (figure 4)\nand subsequent reverse-phase HPLC (figure 5). There\nwas a good correlation between the profiles from each\nsample, with the M. tuberculosis positive standard, clearly\ndemonstrating the presence of specific biomarkers for tuber-\nculosis. The absolute amounts of mycolates in each sample\nwere calculated (table 1). Lung sample 1 contained about\ntwice the level of mycolates in sample 2 and a weaker\nsignal was obtained from the combined femur samples.\nThe proportions of alpha-, methoxy- and keto-mycolates\n(table 2) again correlated well with those from standard\nM. tuberculosis in the stronger lung sample 1, and the\nweaker samples followed the same trend.Proc. R. Soc. B4. DISCUSSION\nThe tissue samples used in these studies contained a rela-\ntively large quantity of what seemed to be insoluble\nforeign substances introduced during mummification.\nFor example, the samples of original lung and gall bladder\nwere noticeably oily. This mummy was unusual as it still\nhad most of its internal organs in situ (Granville 1825).\nTherefore, the process of mummification appears to\nhave differed from the norm. Granville believed that\nafter initial dehydration with natron, the main material\nused was bitumen, possibly mixed with beeswax, but an\nanalysis of embalming residues from the mummy has\nfound no traces of either substance (Harer & Taylor in\npress). It is possible that the unusual process employed\nby the embalmers on this body has affected the retrieval\nof amplifiable DNA, as it has been readily obtained\nfrom other archaeological specimens from the Theban\nnecropolis.\nTable 2.

Where\nadditional molecular characterization has been possible\n(Zink et al. 2001, 2003a,b), this has shown that human\nlineages of the M. tuberculosis complex were present:\nM. tuberculosis and possibly Mycobacterium africanum, but\nnot Mycobacterium bovis. This is consistent with our cur-\nrent understanding of the evolution of the M. tuberculosis\ncomplex and the long-term coexistence of human pop-\nulations with this microbial pathogen (Brosch et al. 2002;\nHershkovitz et al. 2008; Wirth et al. 2008). In the present\nstudy, the M. tuberculosis complex was not further character-\nized owing to the difficulties described above. However, it is\nlikely that the lady Irtyersenu was infected with a strain of\nM. tuberculosis of modern lineage, as these were prevalent in\nthe populations examined by Zink et al. (2003a).\nThe detection of M. tuberculosis complex cell-wall\nmycolic acid biomarkers avoids the problems of DNA\nanalysis. The molecules are far more robust and the\nmethod of analysis is sufficiently sensitive to permit\nthe direct detection of femtogram quantities of material.\nTherefore, a direct biomarker analysis is an excellent\nalternative procedure for the confirmation of DNA find-\nings. In addition, detection of lipid biomarkers appears\nto have potential for the examination of archaeological\nspecimens that are too ancient or have been stored\nunder suboptimal conditions, where DNA detection is\nnot possible.\nIn the case of the Granville mummy, M. tuberculosis\ncomplex DNA was detected in the lung tissue, gall blad-\nder and tissues from possible pleura and diaphragm. The\nHPLC data found the greatest quantity of M. tuberculosis\ncomplex cell-wall mycolates in the lung tissue and lower\namounts in the femurs. Assuming that the pulmonary\nexudate was the prime source of the infection, it appears\nthat the lady Irtyersenu had pulmonary tuberculosis that\nhad disseminated to other sites in the body. During theProc. R. Soc. Bsecond autopsy of Irtyersenu in 1994, it was noted that\nfat was interspersed in her skeletal muscle, which is\nindicative of wasting rather than obesity (Harer &\nTaylor in press). This suggests a somewhat protracted\nterminal illness and\/or very sedentary lifestyle\u2014both of\nwhich are consistent with an active tuberculosis infection.\nThese molecular findings, combined with the histological\nobservations, support a diagnosis of terminal dissemi-\nnated pulmonary tuberculosis, rather than the malaria\nsuggested by the second autopsy. Therefore, we are able\nto enhance the original paper by Granville (1825) to the\nRoyal Society by concluding that there is evidence of an\nactive tuberculosis infection in the lady Irtyersenu and\nthat this, rather than a benign ovarian cystadenoma, was\nlikely to be the major cause of her death.We acknowledge our grateful appreciation of the contributions\nmade by pioneers in the field of aDNA research who made\ntheir unpublished data available to us, which formed the\nbasis for our subsequent work on ancient Egyptian DNA:\nDaniel Carucci, Charles L.
