The task that we set at that time was to master \nthat business and lay the groundwork for commercial success doing it. So the challenge we faced \nwas to create the market for our services and then prove to this market that it cannot exist and \ndevelop without us. (Andrey Dubinsky, CEO, BDO Unicon, Russia)1 \n \nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, auditing has become one of Russia\u2019s most \nsuccessful business sectors. In January 2008, more than 6,400 audit firms were registered with \nthe Ministry of Finance.2 Over the last ten years, Russia\u2019s audit firms have achieved \nremarkable growth rates. In 2001, the auditing business grew by approximately 60% in terms \nof revenue (excluding the then Big Five companies).3 In 2007, the total revenue of Russia\u2019s \n150 largest audit groups (excluding the Big Four) increased by 37.4%, and reached a total of \napproximately 37 billion Roubles.4 This paper analyses the rise and expansion of auditing in \npost-Soviet Russia, and draws particular attention to the complex relationships that were \nformed between auditing practice and the ideas and instruments of marketisation. \nInvestigating the dynamics and conflicts accompanying attempts to establish auditing as a site \nfor a reform of modes of governing, this paper examines the manifold ways in which the \nmeaning of markets and the roles of auditing in them can be unsettled, reinvented and \ntransformed. \nUtilising a linked ecologies approach (Abbott, 1999, 2005b; Fourcade, 2006; Fourcade \n& Khurana, Forthcoming; Ong, 2005; Star, 1995; Star & Griesemer, 1989; Wise, 1988), this \npaper queries the relationship between audit and neoliberal modes of governing (Miller & \nRose, 1990, 2008; Power, 1997; Rose, 1993, 1999). It argues that we should be careful not to \nsee audit as an unproblematic expression of neoliberal government. Following Power (1994, \n                                                 \n1 See www.bdo.ru\/eng\/company\/history\/ (accessed in May 2007). \n2 See \u201cSvedeniya o raspredelenii auditorov, auditorskikh organizatsiy i individual\u2019nykh auditorov po \nfederal\u2019nym okrugam\u201d [Information about the spread of auditors, audit organisations and individual auditors \nacross federal regions], issued by the Russian Ministry of Finance on 25.01.2008. Cf. \nhttp:\/\/www1.minfin.ru\/common\/img\/uploaded\/library\/2008\/02\/svedaudit2007.pdf (accessed in November 2008). \n3 See business journal Ekspert, No. 14, 08.04.2002. \n4 See article \u201cBusiness audit in Russia\u201d which was published in the journal Kommersant and translated by \nGAAP.RU on 22.10.2008. Cf. www.gaap-ifrs.com\/news\/gaap_ifrs\/2293 (accessed in November 2008). \n 2\n1997), the paper agrees that audit is more than a series of mundane techniques. Auditing \nshould also be understood as an idea, \u201ca pervasive logic which has a life over and above \nspecific practices\u201d (Power, 1994, p. 3). Yet, the logic of audit is itself far from unproblematic, \nstable and readily defined. Nor is it exclusively wedded to neoliberalism (Kipnis, 2008; \nStrathern, 2000). We should be careful not to overstate the transformative power of audit. In \npost-Soviet Russia, the rise of ideas of Western-oriented auditing did not automatically lead to \nan end to the earlier Soviet inspection practice. The Russian business of auditing has, at least \npartially, been built into the very same structures that reformers argued needed to be changed. \nFurther, we need to recognise the multiple nature of neoliberalism itself. A variety of \nphenomena can become embraced under the label of neoliberalism (see e.g. Burawoy et al., \n2000; Harvey, 2005; Ong, 2006).5 With the help of a linked ecologies approach, this paper \nseeks to draw attention to the multiple and refracted nature of neoliberalism, and connected \nideas of post-Soviet audit and market creation. Focussing on the \u201cmultiplicity of voices\u201d \n(O'Malley, Weir & Shearing, 1997) within the project of post-Soviet audit reform itself, the \npaper aims not only to enhance our understanding of the specificities of Russian audit \nexpertise. It also seeks more generally to contribute to our understanding of how neoliberal \nmodes of governing are played out and contested in non-Western contexts. \nFollowing Abbott (2005b, p. 248), \u201clinked ecologies\u201d have to be understood \u201cin terms \nof interactions between multiple elements that are neither fully constrained nor fully \nindependent.\u201d An ecology is characterised by \u201cits set of actors, its set of locations and the \nrelation it involves between these\u201d (Abbott, 2005b, p. 245). According to Abbott, the \nparticular social structures and locations of an ecology are not pre-existing positions: \u201cIt is the \nprocess of constructing the relations between actors and locations that in fact constitutes and \ndelimits both actors and locations. Analytically and empirically, the relational process is \n                                                 \n5 Following Harvey (2005, p. 2), this paper defines neoliberalism in the first instance as \u201ca theory of political \neconomic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual \nentrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property \nrights, free markets, and free trade.\u201d As a technology of government (Ong, 2006; Rose, 1993, 1999), \nneoliberalism seeks to reconfigure \u201crelationships between governing and the governed, power and knowledge, \nand sovereignty and territoriality\u201d (Ong, 2006, p. 3). Yet, it cannot be reduced to \u201ca uniform global condition\u201d \n(ibid., p. 14). As Ong points out, \u201cneoliberal forms are often in tension with local cultural sensibilities and \nnational identity\u201d (ibid., p. 12). Neoliberal reform agendas, such as marketisation policies in post-Soviet Russia, \ncreate spaces for experimentation with market reforms, which are not seldom accompanied by local resistance, \nexceptions and mutations (Burawoy, 2001; Burawoy et al., 2000; Burawoy & Verdery, 1999; Hoffman, 2006; \nKipnis, 2008; Sigley, 2006). \n 3\nprior\u201d (Abbott, 2005b, p. 248). A linked ecologies approach thus underscores that audit and \nmarkets, and the boundaries that come to be formed around them, only exist in relation to \nother arenas of economic, political and social activity (for this point see also Burchell, Clubb \n& Hopwood, 1985; Gendron, Cooper & Townley, 2007; Miller & O'Leary, 1994; Power, \n1997; Radcliffe, 1998; Robson, 1991; Robson, Humphrey, Khalifa & Jones, 2007). The \nrelationship between audit and markets, to borrow from Barry, Osborne and Rose (1996: 13), \nis \u201cnot automatically one of functionality or cooptation.\u201d Instead of a single source of change, \nsuch as problematisations of Soviet planning, it is the multiplicity of different factors that are \nto be attended to, the \u201cassemblage\u201d, \u201cnetwork\u201d or \u201cfield\u201d of actors, instruments and ideas \ninvolved in post-Soviet audit and market reform (Callon, Millo & Muniesa, 2007; Chua, \n1995; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Gendron et al., 2007; Latour, 2005; Miller, 1991, 2008; \nMiller & O'Leary, 1994; Ong & Collier, 2005; Power, 1997; Quattrone & Hopper, 2005; \nRobson et al., 2007; Suddaby, Cooper & Greenwood, 2007). \nA linked ecologies approach emphasises change, internal dynamics and the \noverlapping and interpenetrating of previously distinct worlds. Rather than focusing on the \nways in which different arenas, networks or fields give rise to the emergence of a particular \naccounting technology \u2013 such as value-added accounting or discounted cash flow analysis \n(Burchell et al., 1985; Miller, 1991) \u2013 attention is focused on the ways in which arenas and \nfields themselves come to be interlinked and reworked. Emphasis is placed on the modes and \nprocesses of mediation and co-production between different arenas or fields (see also Miller \n& O'Leary, 2007; Wise, 1988).6 \nIn the case studied, markets for audit were actively created, crafted and shaped, not \nonly by the Russian government, but also by the newly founded audit firms and their \nrepresentational instruments. Emphasis was shifted from auditing as an abstract mechanism \ndesigned to help develop markets, to the marketisation of audit organisations. Auditing itself \ncame to be marketised and seen as a platform for entrepreneurial self-realisation. The new \n                                                 \n6 In this respect, a linked ecologies approach can also help overcome some of the limitations that have been \nascribed to the concept of fields in institutional analysis (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Suddaby et al., 2007; \nWooten & Hoffman, 2008). Ecological analysis helps to see fields no longer \u201cas containers for the community of \norganisations\u201d, but as a \u201crelational space\u201d, an \u201cintertwined constellation of actors who hold differing \nperspectives and competing logics\u201d (Wooten & Hoffman, 2008, pp. 138-140). As Abbott points out, it is in many \nways a much loser and empirical model and an attempt \u201cto find regularity in a social world first imagined as \nutterly fluid\u201d (Abbott, 2005a, p. 6). \n 4\naudit entrepreneurs themselves, in cooperation with the government, created the markets they \nsought to rule. A linked ecologies approach draws attention to such changing relations and \ndynamics between Soviet and post-Soviet, old and new, global and local audit definitions and \nmarketisation attempts, and helps scrutinise the changing interplays between auditing and \nmarkets. It makes us aware that the market relevance of auditing is not fixed, nor should it be \npresumed. It has to be actively built and rebuilt. And as studies of changes in Western audit \npractices have made us aware (see e.g. Curtis & Turley, 2007; Gendron et al., 2007; Jeppesen, \n1998; Robson et al., 2007), such processes of defining and redefining are likely to be the site \nof significant struggles, where outcomes are only provisional, and where they can be \nchallenged and changed more than once. \nA linked ecologies approach asks us to develop a more complex and dynamic account \nof the relations between different and sometimes competing programmes of post-Soviet \ngovernmental reform, audit development and market creation. It seeks to make room for the \ncomplexities and paradoxes that derive from attempts to spread and utilise somewhat \nambiguous and ill-defined Western concepts of neoliberal government, marketisation and \nauditing. In so doing, it is distinct from population ecology approaches that, for instance, have \nbeen put forward in organisational theory (e.g. Hannan & Freeman, 1989). In contrast to \nHannan and Freeman\u2019s population ecology approach, a linked ecologies approach is neither \nfunctionalist, nor does it make a priori strong assumptions about the actors, their properties \nand surroundings that it seeks to study. Abbott\u2019s definition of linked ecologies draws on the \nearly Chicago School in sociology (Abbott, 1999; Goffman, 1963; Hughes, 1971) and is very \nclosely related to constructivist ecological analyses, which have been carried out in the \ncontext of science and technology studies (Akera, 2007; Star, 1995; Star & Griesemer, 1989; \nStar & Ruhleder, 2001; Wise, 1988) and anthropology (Ong, 2005, 2006; Ong & Collier, \n2005).7 \n                                                 \n7 As Akera (2007) put it, the notion of (linked) ecologies makes it possible to incorporate the various advances in \nconstructivist scholarship into the sociological study of the occupations and professions. Within science and \ntechnology studies, Star (1995; Star & Griesemer, 1989; Star & Ruhleder, 2001) and Akera (2007) have used an \necological metaphor to attend to the contingency, indeterminacy and complexity of knowledge production, and \nto explore linkages between knowledge and its various contexts. In anthropology, Ong (2005, 2006) used the \nnotion of \u201cecologies of expertise\u201d and \u201ceco-system\u201d to draw attention to \u201csituated entanglements\u201d of markets and \nneoliberalisms in East-Asia. And in accounting, Miller and O\u2019Leary (2000) wrote about eco-systems in value \nreporting, investigating the roles of technical analysts in the organising and composing of financial information \nflows. \n 5\nA linked ecologies approach highlights the multiple determinations of audit and \nmarket ecologies, and it problematises the trajectories of their change (see also Ong & Collier, \n2005). This implies that the move from socialist inspection to market-oriented auditing cannot \nbe conceptualised as a period of change from one stage to the next, organised around certain \npredefined notions of market rationality, economic progressiveness and regulatory \neffectiveness. Although Russia\u2019s reformers were largely inspired by Western discourses of \nneoliberalism and progressiveness,8 we should be careful not to take such discourses at face \nvalue and to assume that they are transplanted unchanged. The transition from inspection to \nauditing is neither a one-way process of change, nor are its objectives as clearly defined as is \noften suggested by mainstream audit theories. The transformations that the Russian and other \nEastern European societies underwent, and continue to undergo, are grounded in a complex \nreworking of old relations, past and present, Soviet and post-Soviet, socialist inspection and \nimagined new audit worlds (Burawoy & Verdery, 1999; Kelemen & Kostera, 2002; Stark, \n1996; Stark & Bruszt, 1998). \nA few studies have described and analysed the emergence of Western-oriented \naccounting professionalism(s) in developing and post-colonial economies (Annisette, 2000; \nHammond, Clayton & Arnold, 2008; Neu, Ocampo Gomez, Graham & Heincke, 2006; Sian, \n2006; Uche, 2002), and there is an emerging body of literature examining the specificities of \nnew audit practices in Eastern Europe and Russia (see e.g. Bychkova, 1996; Enthoven, \nSokolov, Bychkova, Kovalev & Semenova, 1998; Kosmala, 2007; Kosmala MacLullich & \nSucher, 2004; Mennicken, 2008; Samsonova, 2009; Sucher & Bychkova, 2001; Sucher, \nMoizer & Zelenka, 1998). Yet, little attention has been devoted so far to analysing the \nlinkages that have formed between ideas and instruments of audit, and wider processes of \nlocal and global market creation, and how such processes may or may not contribute to the \nchanging of relations between government, authority and expertise (Rose, 1993). There have \nbeen few studies of what happens when previously state-administered accounting and audit \n                                                 \n8 Particularly in the early 1990s, Russia submitted itself to a range of neoliberal reform measures, commonly \nreferred to as \u2018shock therapy\u2019 (Arbatov, 2001; Bogomolov, 2001). These measures sought to minimise direct \nstate intervention and included the removal of price controls, privatisation, the cutting of government spending, \nand proposals for a Western-oriented accounting and audit reform aimed at making financial reporting more \nuseful for economic decision-making. The reforms were propagated by Western economic advisers (Jeffrey \nSachs, Anders \u01faslund, Andrei Shleifer) and multilateral institutions, such as the IMF, World Bank and OECD \n(Boycko, Shleifer & Vishny, 1995; IMF, IBRD, OECD & EBRD, 1991; Lieberman, Nellis, Karlova, Mukherjee \n& Rahuja, 1995; OECD, 2005). \n 6\nexperts become, as Rose (1993, p. 285) has put it, \u201crelocated within [an imagined, added AM] \nmarket governed by the rationalities of competition, accountability and consumer demand.\u201d \nThis paper seeks to redress this relative oversight by considering how linkages between audit, \nmarkets and modes of governing were established, challenged and changed, and with what \neffects. \nThe remainder of the paper investigates how projects of post-Soviet market and audit \ndevelopment were carried forward, shifted and changed at government level, and at the level \nof new \u201centerprising selves\u201d and their newly founded audit and consulting firms. There were \nmany factors driving the development of audit expertise that went beyond the demand from \nfirms and investors for mechanisms of corporate control and accountability. Western-oriented \nauditing was brought into existence before investors could articulate their control demands. \nCapital markets were virtually absent, and Russian audit entrepreneurs and their audit firms, \nin cooperation with government, created and shaped the markets they sought to rule. \nAlongside these changes, market ideals changed too. Markets came to be viewed as a space \nfor experimentation, something to be actively ordered and organised, rather than an abstract \nmechanism of economic coordination. \nThese changing interplays and shifts are now examined in five main steps. The next \nsection provides a brief outline of research methods and the empirical materials collected. \nSection 2 traces the beginnings of audit development in post-Soviet Russia. It describes and \nanalyses how programmes and discourses of market-oriented audit reform were articulated at \ngovernment level following Gorbachev\u2019s calls for Perestroika [Restructuring] in the late \n1980s. It shows how Western-oriented audit reform proposals were inextricably linked to \nRussia\u2019s wider transition from a planned to a market economy. Auditing, to quote Rose \n(1999, p. 150), became involved in discourses aimed at transforming the Soviet \u201cethos of \ngovernment\u201d \u2013 \u201cfrom one of bureaucracy to one of business, from one of planning to one of \ncompetition, from one of command and control to one of choice, self-regulation and \nindividual responsibility.\u201d The subsequent sections scrutinise these neoliberal \u201cdreams and \nschemes\u201d (Miller & Rose, 1990), and examine how market and audit ideals came to be \nshifted, translated and reworked. \n 7\nSection 3 analyses attempts to operationalise the abstract market and audit reform \nprogrammes through the foundation of state-independent, commercial audit firms. It is shown \nhow commercial auditing and state-independent audit firms came to be advanced as vehicles \nable to transform the ailing Soviet inspection apparatus, operationalise goals of market-\noriented reform, economise mechanisms of state administration and increase regulatory \nefficiency. We observe a shift from programmes promoting audit as a state-independent \ninstitution of control and oversight, to programmes seeking the marketisation of auditing \nitself. Section 4 analyses how post-Soviet auditing was made marketable. It is shown how the \nmarket relevance of auditing had to be actively built, with tools that were not necessarily \ndirectly related to audit and inspection activities. Audit had to be turned into an economic \nbusiness before audit itself could take place, and audit ideas came to be merged with Western \nmarketing and consulting expertise. Western audit and consulting firms (particularly the then \nBig Six), together with their marketing instruments, became important reference points in the \nerection of boundaries between the present and the past, the production of public visibility \nand the creation of new systems of audit representation and intra-occupational \ndifferentiations. Yet, former Soviet calculative practices and inspection technologies were not \nentirely changed or replaced; rather, they were rewrapped and restaged, with the help of \nWestern ideas and instruments of market creation \u2013 technologies of ranking, branding and \norganisational management. \nSection 5 concludes the paper with a discussion of the more general implications of \nthese findings for our understanding of the dynamics of audit professionalisation and the \nchanging relations between markets, politics and expertise. The paper revisits Cooper and \nRobson\u2019s (2006) reminder that professional firms, particularly large international firms, are \nincreasingly important in accounting professionalisation and regulatory processes (see also \nDezalay & Sugarman, 1995; Greenwood & Suddaby, 2006; Greenwood, Suddaby & \nMcDougald, 2006; Hanlon, 1998; Hinings, Greenwood & Cooper, 1999; Robson et al., 2007; \nRobson, Willmott, Cooper & Puxty, 1994; Suddaby et al., 2007). It is argued that we need to \nredirect attention away from questions of professional association, towards instruments and \nactivities of internationalisation and micro-differentiation to recognise the diverse ways in \nwhich audit expertise is organised, staged and legitimised. This suggests the need for more \n 8\ncomparative and micro-sociological studies of audit and audit cultures to appreciate their \nmultiplicity, and to better understand how ideas of neoliberalism, audit and market creation \nare played out, transformed and subverted in day-to-day practices. \nMethods and materials \nFollowing Denzin and Lincoln (2000, pp. 4-6), in the context of this study, a \nqualitative research approach was adopted that can be understood as bricolage where different \nsets of representations are assembled and different methods of investigation are employed to \ndevelop an in-depth understanding of the field. Different methods were utilised to facilitate a \nmulti-layered understanding of the issues connected to processes of marketisation and post-\nSoviet audit reform, and display their multiple and refracted nature. In the collection of the \nempirical materials, the study involved archival research, in-depth interviewing and \nparticipant observation methods. The document analysis covers the period from 1985 to 2008. \nBesides legal documents, Soviet and post-Soviet accounting and audit journals \n(Bukhgalterskii uchet, Auditorskie Vedomosti), Soviet and post-Soviet accounting and audit \ntextbooks, newspapers (Vedomosti, Finansovaya gazeta, Nezavisimaya gazeta, Izvestiya, \nKommersant daily, Moscow Times) and business magazines (Ekspert, Kommersant, Profil\u2019) \nwere analysed. \nAs representatives and creators of \u201cprogrammatic knowledge\u201d (Radcliffe, 1999, p. \n338), professional, legal, academic and other documents provided a good starting point in \nunderstanding the specificities of post-Soviet audit reform and market creation, and were an \nimportant source in the analysis of the ways in which the significance of auditing and markets \nwas articulated and produced. The document analysis was complemented with 48 in-depth \ninterviews (Wengraf, 2001), carried out in Moscow between 2001 and 2002, and several \nperiods of participant observation (Spradley, 1980). Participant observations made it possible \nto link the collected interviews and other materials to the contexts within which they were \nproduced, and they helped to better understand the diverse ways in which ideas of audit and \nmarket-oriented development were articulated, interrelated, and reworked. The interviews \nwere conducted with former Soviet financial inspectors, Russian auditors, state regulators, \nrepresentatives of new professional associations, academics, representatives of large Western \n 9\naccounting firms, multilateral organisations (World Bank), and other international \norganisations (Association for Certified Chartered Accountants, International Centre for \nAccounting Reform in Russia). Participant observations were carried out in two large Russian \naudit firms (for two months and two and a half months respectively) and the International \nCentre for Accounting Reform (for one month). Most interviews were conducted in Russian \nand transcribed in Cyrillic. For the purpose of this paper, quotes taken from Russian language \ninterviews and documents were translated into English by the author. Where the translation of \na specific term was ambiguous, the original Russian term has been added in brackets next to \nthe English translation. \nThe paper assembles multiple visions of auditing and marketisation to navigate \nthrough the different, at times controversial, perspectives and voices attached to post-Soviet \naudit and processes of market creation. In Russia, the idea of audit was born with Perestroika \nin the late 1980s. The Soviet government advanced audit as an institution for dealing with \neconomic and social transition. Here, audit came to constitute much more than a reaction to \nfinancial control deficiencies. It was seen as a way through which Russia\u2019s government and \neconomy could be re-organised according to Western constructs of global capitalism and \nmarket-oriented development, and it is to these early beginnings of post-Soviet audit \ndevelopment, and the intertwinement of audit with wider programmes of governmental \nreform, that we now first turn. \nFrom state administration to market-economic methods of governance \nAn important official point of departure for Russian audit development was \nconstituted by the Soviet government in January 1987, with the approval of regulations for \njoint venture operations (Decrees No. 48 and 49 of 13 January 1987). Here, for the first time, \nthe term \u201caudit\u201d [audit] was used in a legal context to replace the term of financial revision \n[reviziya]. Inter alia, the decree states: \nIn order to exercise their oversight rights, the participants in the joint enterprise are to be provided, \nin the procedure specified in the articles of incorporation, with information relating to the \noperations of the enterprise and the status of its assets, as well as information on profits and losses. \nThe joint enterprise may have an auditing commission [auditorskaya kommissiya] that is formed \nin the procedure specified in the articles of incorporation. Audits of joint enterprises\u2019 financial, \neconomic, and commercial operations are performed for a fee by a Soviet self-financed \n[khozraschetny] auditing organization [auditorskaya organizatsiya]. (Quoted from Boguslavsky & \nSmirnov, 1989, p. 194) \n 10\nFrom this point on, financial controls were no longer exclusively carried out through \nthe control apparatus of the state. Self-sustaining, state-independent [khozraschetny] auditing \norganisations entered the picture of financial regulation. The financial controls of joint \nventures were to be carried out for a fee, payable by the inspected entity to the auditing \norganisation.9 This change from state-led inspection [reviziya] to commercial auditing [audit] \nhad its roots in a combination of different demands and problematisations questioning not \nonly old practices of Soviet financial inspection but much more widely the Soviet regime of \ncentral planning, command and control. Paraphrasing Power (1995), the emergence of \nauditing in Russia can be seen as closely linked to the \u201ctransformation of regulatory styles\u201d \nand attempts to reinvent post-Soviet government in accordance with Western market ideals. \nAs the Deputy Director of one of today\u2019s biggest Russian audit firms comments: \nThe idea of auditing was born with Perestroika in the late 1980s. With the emergence of market \neconomic structures auditing also emerged. Before that, what did we have? We had a planned \neconomy. And we had government controls. The government controlled profits and calculated \ntaxes. We had bookkeepers, but no accountants or financial directors. In theory all that existed, but \nit wasn\u2019t called the economics of an enterprise. [\u2026] We had financial reports, we had accounts, \nbut these were statistics, not really economic facts. In reality, it didn\u2019t really mean very much. This \nsystem didn\u2019t require the work of auditors, but we did have inspectors [revizory]. \nIn Russia, auditing was introduced as part of broader reform programmes aimed at \neconomic liberalisation, privatisation, and the repositioning of the (post-)Soviet state. \nSocialist forms of rule had been called into question, and new market-oriented modes of \ngoverning, including auditing, came to be put forward to redefine the roles of the state, \nenhance efficiency, reduce bureaucracy and extend rationalities of market-oriented exchange \nand accountability (see e.g. Danilevsky, 1991; IMF et al., 1991; Lieberman et al., 1995). \nYet, the move from state financial inspection to state-independent commercial \nauditing did not take the form of a clear-cut break. In the late 1980s, state financial inspection \npractices began to be reframed under the label of auditing without it being clear where the \nreform attempts were heading. The meaning of the word audit and what distinguished \nauditing from old Soviet inspection practices had to be worked out, again and again. And \n                                                 \n9 The first Soviet audit firm was founded in September 1987, under the leadership of the Soviet Ministry of \nFinance (Antonov, 1989). The firm was founded as a shareholding company [aktsionernye obshestvo], but the \nSoviet state was still its exclusive stockholder. Between 1987 and 1988, all joint venture enterprises that \noperated in the Soviet Union had to undergo audits by Inaudit. In March 1988, this monopoly was dissolved and \nmanagers of joint ventures were allowed to choose their auditors themselves (Geron, 1989: 11). During this time, \nthe first private Russian audit businesses also emerged. In 1989, for example, Unicon, was founded, in 1990, \nFBK, in 1991Rufaudit, and in 1992 Rusaudit and Topaudit. In 2002, these firms belonged to the top ten Russian \naudit firms in terms of number of employees and revenues (see article in journal Profil\u2019, 11 March 2002, p. 80). \n 11\nimportant reference points in working out distinctions between socialist inspection and \nmarket-oriented auditing, came not only to constitute Western audit technologies (such as \naudit risk models and audit sampling procedures), but also the commercial nature of audit \nitself. Government officials, academics and Soviet audit practitioners saw in the commercial \nnature of auditing one of the most defining features distinguishing it from socialist state \ninspection (Danilevsky, 1987a; Danilevsky, 1991; Suyts, Akhmetbekov & Dubrovina, 2001). \nFrom the beginning, audit (in contrast to socialist inspection) came to be placed in the context \nof market-oriented business activities. Audit and markets were viewed as inextricably \ninterlinked, as mechanisms of control and coordination, which mutually condition and \nreinforce each other. But this did not mean that old inspection practices ceased to exist. The \nauditing profession-to-be came to inhabit multiple, contradictory contexts. As Stark (1996) \nwould put it, we observe \u201cthe interweaving of multiple justificatory principles\u201d, a \nrecombination of old and new, with actors manoeuvring through a multiplicity of different \nlegitimating principles, building new market-oriented institutions (such as auditing) not on, \nbut with the ruins of the past. \nDuring Soviet socialism, financial controls, so-called revisions [reviziya]10, were set \nup as an integral part of the planning apparatus of the Soviet state. The organisation of the \ncontrols was centred on the objective of financial plan fulfilment, in particular with respect to \nthe observance of state-set costing plans (Chumachenko, 1985; Kramarovsky, 1987a; \nKrasnov, 1987; Mitrofanov, 1965). Soviet inspectors worked as state servants, and they \nreceived their orders either from the Soviet Ministry of State Control, the Ministry of Finance, \nthe branch ministries or other, local governmental control organs. The main objectives of the \nstate financial inspections were to ensure that assets were not misused, that outputs were not \nmisappropriated and that accounts were prepared in accordance with the rules and procedures \nset out by the government. The controls consisted mainly of detailed, highly formalised \nchecks of procedural compliance. For example, it was checked whether bookkeeping rules \nhad been properly applied, whether forms had been correctly filled out, whether stamps and \n                                                 \n10 It should be noted that the term \u201crevision\u201d has been, and still is, widely used in the conduct of financial audits \nin German-speaking countries, as well as a number of other continental European countries, such as Denmark \n(see e.g. Christiansen & Loft, 1992). The Germanic word \u201cRevision\u201d and the Russian word \u201creviziya\u201d have both \nbeen derived from Latin [revidere, revisio]. \u201cRevidere\u201d, in Latin, refers to general processes of checking. In post-\nSoviet Russia, the term \u201creviziya\u201d has been replaced with the term \u201caudit\u201d to signal the Western re-orientation of \nthe formerly state-led system of financial control. \n 12\nsignatures were in the right place and whether the documentation of production cycles was \ncomplete (see e.g. Kramarovsky, 1970; Mitrofanov, 1965). Further, inspection work itself was \nsubject to a detailed plan. The inspectors had to follow a detailed annual state inspection plan \nwhich set out control objectives, time frames, and allowable failure rates (Chumachenko, \n1985; Danilevsky, 1987a). But financial inspections were not only an integral part of the \nSoviet planning apparatus; they were also part of Soviet communist ideology. Party officials, \nacademics and other actors involved in the political governance of the Soviet state portrayed \nfinancial inspections as an important instrument to facilitate the realisation of socialism \n(Chumachenko, 1985; Kramarovsky, 1970, pp. 5-13; Krasnov, 1987; Mitrofanov, 1965, pp. 3-\n16). State financial inspections were an integral part of Soviet governmentality rooted in \nideals of central planning, surveillance, command and control and social equity. The Great \nSoviet Encyclopaedia [Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya] (Vvedensky, 1955, p. 175), for \nexample, states: \nIn the USSR, financial inspections [reviziya] support the consolidation of socialist lawfulness and \nstate discipline. \nIn Krasnov\u2019s (1987, p. 14) study of the history of socialist control we read: \nIn a socialist society, control fulfils the role of an instrument to consolidate socialist forms of \nsocial life, where private property does not exist. [\u2026] Socialist [financial] control is directed \ntowards the liquidation of oppression and exploitation. \nIn accordance with these ideologically motivated definitions of socialist state \ninspection, Western auditing was viewed as a means of control that was inherently linked to \ncapitalism \u2013 private enrichment, exploitation, inequality and individual responsibilisation \n(Kramarovsky, 1970, p. 9). A Soviet financial dictionary, in 1988, still described auditing as \nan activity that serves the interests of \u201cmonopolist capital\u201d and deepens class divisions \n(Garetovskii, 1988, p. 49). \nProblematising Soviet command and control \nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, this picture began to change. On 11 March 1985 \nMikhail Gorbachev was elected General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet \nUnion (CPSU). At the 27th Congress of the CPSU in February 1986, Gorbachev called for \nradical reforms in the economy. Perestroika [economic restructuring] and Glasnost [policy of \nmaximal publicity, openness and debate] came to be cornerstones of Gorbachev\u2019s reform \n 13\npolicies (Gorbachev, 1987). An immense struggle for economic and political reform had \nbegun, which was aimed at moving gradually (as far as proved necessary) in the direction of a \nmarket economy, democratisation, openness, political freedom and more Western-friendly \nthinking in foreign policy (\u00c5slund, 1991). \nAt the Central Committee Plenum in June 1987, a reform programme was adopted \nwhich promoted a shift \u201cfrom primarily administrative to primarily economic management \nmethods at every level\u201d (Gorbachev, 1987, p. 33). Gorbachev and his advisors problematised \nthe severe centralisation of the Soviet management system \u2013 being, as he put it, \u201cregulated \ndown to the last detail\u201d, \u201cstrictly posing tasks and allotted budget sums\u201d (Gorbachev, 1987, p. \n46). He and other Perestroika proponents, like Aganbegyan, argued for the broadening of the \nrights and economic autonomy of enterprises, the enhancement of competition, self-\nresponsibility and self-administration (Aganbegyan, 1988, 1989; \u00c5slund, 1991; Gorbachev, \n1987). Centralised economic management was to be reorganised \u201cin the interests of \nenterprises\u201d (ibid.), more freedom was to be granted to managers, \u201cgenuine economic \nincentives\u201d were to be introduced (ibid., p. 90), and measures were to be invented making \nprofit a concern, encouraging \u201cself-government\u201d [samoupravlenie] and more \u201cinitiative and \ncreative endeavour\u201d (ibid., p. 34). In the reform programme we can read: \n[\u2026] Ministries, state committees and other state departments are required to resolutely change \nforms and methods of managing associations, enterprises and organisations. [They are required] to \nchange from administrative to primarily economic methods [of management and control]; to \nprovide the necessary conditions and scope for the adoption of economic accounting procedures \n[khozraschet], self-financing [samofinansirovanie] and self-management [samoupravlenie]. \n(Article 4, Resolution N7283-XI, Supreme Soviet, 30 June 1987, \u201cThe perestroika of the \nmanagement of the national economy\u201d) \nWith the term \u201ckhozraschet\u201d government officials referred to economic methods of \ngovernance and management, economic cost accounting, the operation of a business on a self-\nsustaining basis (meaning without state subsidies) and profit orientation (Corten, 1992, p. 63). \nThe term has existed in the Russian language since the 1920s, but gained new significance in \nthe early years of the Gorbachev era. Under the Perestroika movement, the mechanism of \n\u201ckhozraschet\u201d was (re-)introduced to provide enterprises with more accountability, economic \nindependence and planning autonomy (Aganbegyan, 1988, 1989; Gorbachev, 1987). \nOrganisations were encouraged to plan their finances and production independently, and in \n1988, following the earlier approval of regulations for joint venture operations, the Law on \n 14\nCo-operatives was adopted, which made forms of private entrepreneurship for the first time \nmore widely allowable and promotable. \nDuring this phase of Perestroika politics, also the system of state financial inspection \n[reviziya] came to be problematised, openly discussed and criticised. Restrained criticisms \nhad already been formulated in the 1960s and 1970s, but under the Perestroika movement it \nhad become possible, for the first time, to discuss these issues in a wider forum, and with less \npressure to conform to Marxist-Leninist ideology. The discussions commenced as far back as \nApril 1981, when the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued a resolution that set out, \naccording to the title, \u201cMeasures for the improvement of control and inspection work in the \nministries, departments and other offices of governmental management [organy \nupravleniya]\u201d.11 The resolution criticised the work of the existing inspection institutions \nprofoundly: \nThe Council of Ministers of the USSR notes that the [\u2026] controls of the financial and economic \nactivities of associations, enterprises, organisations and other institutions continue to show serious \ndeficiencies. The ministries, departments and other offices carrying out inspections and controls \nare still not very effective and only to a very limited extent meet the requirements of enhancing \nstate discipline, preventing mismanagement and guaranteeing the preservation of socialist \nproperty. The inspections and controls are not seldom of a superficial, formal character and do not \nexhibit the required positive influence on the work of the associations, enterprises, organisations \nand institutions as they should do. \nSubsequent to the resolution, the major Soviet accounting journal Bukhgalterskii uchet \nbegan to publish a series of articles discussing the current situation of the inspection \napparatuses, and reconfirming the need for reform. The debate started cautiously, but over the \nyears, and encouraged by Gorbachev\u2019s Perestroika politics (1985-1991), the articles became \nstronger in their critique and reform requests. In November 1985, for example, the journal \npublished an article that openly problematised the \u201cadministrative focus\u201d of the inspections \nand their lack of economic analysis: \nMany of the reports [akty] that are prepared by the control and inspection apparatuses do not \ncontain a deep analysis of the economic situation of the controlled enterprises and associations \n[\u2026]. The inspectors usually spend only a very limited amount of time [on the controls], which \ndoes not allow them to come to a thorough understanding of the particularities of the ways of \ndocumentation [dokumentooborota] and the specificity of the financial and economic activities of \nthe controlled enterprises [\u2026]. In many cases the controls and inspections are carried out to meet \n[their own] plan requirements and are of a quite formal [ritualistic] nature. (Zhurko, 1985, p. 24) \n                                                 \n11 See resolution [postanovlenie] N 325 of the Council of Ministers of the USSR from 02.04.1981. In 1980, five \nyears before Gorbachev was elected General Secretary of the CPSU, he had already received full membership of \nthe Politburo, and reform needs had been articulated then particularly within the circles of the Young Communist \nLeague (Komsomol) (\u00c5slund, 1991; Gorbachev, 1997). \n 15\nIn the subsequent years, the journal published more and more articles, emphasising the \nindispensability of a fundamental re-organisation of financial inspection and control. Between \n1985 and 1990, almost every monthly issue of the journal contained at least two or three \ncontributions criticising the existing inspection practices and calling for reform. These \ncontributions were written by parties outside the inspection apparatus (e.g. academics), as \nwell as by the people within it. Between 1985 and 1990, Yuri Danilevsky, for example, who \nwas at that time the head of the major financial control division [kontrol\u2019no-revizionnoe \nupravlenie] of the Soviet Ministry of Finance, published nine articles in the journal \nBukhgalterskii uchet carrying titles such as \u201cFinancial control and the economy\u201d (Danilevsky, \n1987a), \u201cImproving control and inspection work\u201d (Danilevsky, 1987b) and \u201cFinancial control: \nwhat it should become\u201d (Danilevsky, 1990). Other publications were headed with titles such \nas \u201cEnhancing the effectiveness of departmental controls\u201d, \u201cImproving controls for the \nreliability [dostovernost\u2019] of accounts\u201d, \u201cCadres of a new type\u201d and \u201cAbout the perestroika of \ncontrol and inspection work\u201d.12 \nThe criticisms within these articles focused on deficiencies in the educational and \ntraining programmes of financial inspectors, the internal fragmentation of the control and \ninspection systems, and the limited impact of inspections on enterprise management. Some \narticles addressed the superficiality of state controls and pointed out the low morale of \ninspectors in the workplace (e.g. Zhurko, 1985). Others talked about the scarcity of financial \nand human resources to fulfil inspection tasks, or found fault with the lack of internal quality \ncontrols (Kundrotas, 1988, 1989). To put these criticisms into perspective, it is important to \nunderstand that, in the Soviet Union, financial inspectors (similar to bookkeepers) did not \nenjoy a particularly high status. In comparison to other occupations, they were relatively \nlowly paid and not considered to be well educated (Bailey, 1973; Kramarovsky, 1987b; \nShafirova, 1986, 1990; Solov'ev, 1988; Zhurko, 1985). In addition, the inspection apparatus \nwas well known for its bulkiness and fragmented management structures. Since the late \n1930s, it was frequently pointed out that the apparatus lacked co-ordination and suffered from \n                                                 \n12 The articles quoted above were published in the following issues of the journal Bukhgalterskii uchet: \nDecember 1985, June 1986, October 1986, and June 1988. The articles represent only a small fraction of the \ntotal number of articles that were published on this topic during that time. \n 16\nduplication of effort.13 This was partly the case, because financial controls were embedded in \na variety of different state structures, which were not very well connected with each other. \nThe accounting department of an enterprise, for instance, was subject to a series of different \ncontrols (see e.g. Campbell, 1974). On the one hand, the department was subject to controls of \nthe relevant branch ministries. On the other hand, the Gosbank (the Soviet Central Bank) \nwould send out its own inspectors to ensure that the prices employed by the accountants were \nin accordance with those fixed by the government. In addition, the Ministry of Finance sent \ncontrollers that came in to check that the payments and revenues were made in line with the \noverall finance plan.14 \nFollowing the criticisms and stimulated by the market-oriented reforms undertaken \nelsewhere, reformers argued for the need to make state financial inspections \u201cmore \neconomic\u201d, less bureaucratic, and more relevant to the interests of enterprises. \u201cEconomic \nmethods\u201d of inspection were to be developed, moving financial control away from a focus on \ncorrect weight, quantity and other administrative planning measures, to an emphasis on \nquality, efficiency and profit and loss calculation (see in particular issues No. 1 to 5 and 10, \n1989, and issues No. 1 and 4, 1990, of Bukhgalterskii uchet). In this context, Western \ncommercial auditing came to be seen as an important reference point (Danilevsky, 1990; \nDanilevsky, 1991, 1995a, b). Western commercial auditing came to be regarded as a possible \nmechanism for accelerating processes of governmental modernisation and downsizing. Seen \nas a central element in Western market infrastructures, auditing should help promote \n\u201ceconomic thinking\u201d and market-oriented development, not only outside but also within the \ninspection apparatus. It should help stimulate market-oriented change and contribute to the \ndissolution of the Soviet state monopoly over financial control (Danilevsky, 1991; Shpig, \n1990). In the accounting journal Bukhgalterskii uchet we read: \nThe transition towards a market economy poses new requirements to the control over financial-\neconomic activities of different enterprises. [\u2026] [State-independent] audit controls make the work \nof state institutions easier; they also make the work for enterprises easier. [\u2026] Audits are \nimportant to signal the healthiness of an enterprise; [\u2026and] audit firms help to build up and \norganise market relations. (Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1991, No. 8, p. 40) \nAn article published in an earlier issue of the journal states: \n                                                 \n13 See in particular the article by Kramarovsky (1987b), which provides a comprehensive account of the control \nand inspection problems that were discussed in the journal Bukhgalterskii uchet between 1937 and 1987. \n14 For a more detailed analysis of these issues see Chumachenko (1985) and Krasnov (1987). \n 17\nCompletely new forms of control should accompany the market economy; one form of those [new \ncontrols] is auditing. [\u2026] In developed countries, audit services make up one of the strands of big \nbusiness. A thoughtful adoption of these services in our country could have a huge social and \norganisational impact on the improvement of the management of industry in our developing \nmarket economy. [\u2026] It is necessary to learn quickly and intensively more about Western audit \nexpertise. (Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1991, No. 1, pp. 38-39) \nDanilevsky, the former head of the inspection division of the Soviet Ministry of \nFinance, writes: \nThe development of market relations, and particularly shareholding forms of property, call for the \nneed to establish a system of [state] independent, external financial control [audit]. (Bukhgalterskii \nuchet, 1991, No. 3, p. 4) \nWestern auditing came to be seen as a necessary response to the envisaged market \nreforms. It was called upon to strengthen the accountability of enterprises, to enhance their \nautonomy, and to promote regimes of economic cost accounting and self-governance. The \nnext section takes a closer look at this nexus between auditing, audit firms and market-\noriented reform demands. It analyses the mutual intertwinement of audit and markets and \ntheir establishment as \u201clinked ecologies\u201d (Abbott, 2005b). It is shown that auditing was not \nonly called upon to build markets. The market-oriented nature of auditing itself came to be \nviewed as an indispensable element of its effectiveness. Looking at the West and large \nWestern audit firms, particularly the then Big Six, auditing itself was to be structured in \naccordance with principles and images of market rationality, to make it state-independent, \neconomic and user-oriented. This did not mean that old inspection practices completely \ndisappeared. Rather, they came to be re-articulated within the new market ideals. \nAudit, audit firms and neoliberal reform demands \nIn April 1991, Boris Yeltsin, in his function as Chairman of the Supreme Council of \nthe Russian Soviet Republic, announced in the Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya gazeta: \nWe [the government] have to return to our people economic and legal rights and freedom. [\u2026] We \nhave to develop conditions for a return of Russia to the system of the world market and world \nculture. (Nezavisimaya gazeta, 02.04.1991) \nParticularly between 1989 and 1992, Soviet and later post-Soviet transformation \npolicies came to be grounded in beliefs that processes of radical marketisation, liberalisation \nand privatisation could transform Russia\u2019s highly bureaucratised, statist economic system, \nincluding its unwieldy inspection apparatus, into a dynamic, competitive capitalist economy \n(\u00c5slund, Boone, Johnson, Fischer & Ickes, 1996; Gaidar, 2003; IMF et al., 1991; Sachs & \n 18\nWarner, 1995; World Bank, 1996). Gorbachev acknowledged that \u201cthere is no alternative to \nshifting to the market\u201d (Pomer, 2001, p. 2), and Yeltsin \u201cchampioned immediate \ntransformation of Russian socialism into laissez-faire capitalism\u201d (ibid. , p. 1). As Pomer \n(2001, p. 4) recalls, on 2 January 1992, by presidential decree, coordination of the economy \nby central planning was terminated \u2013 most price controls were lifted, doors to foreign trade \nand capital flows were thrown open, and government spending was cut sharply: \u201cThe goal \nwas immediate transition to unfettered markets, thereby allowing the market to guide the \neconomy without government interference.\u201d The supposedly successful capitalist societies of \nWestern Europe and the United States became important reference points for what post-\ncommunist Russian society aspired to become (Bogomolov, 2001; Lane, 2002; Pickles & \nSmith, 1998). To quote Bogomolov (2001, p. 53): \nGorbachev\u2019s intent to transition to the market was met by the West with beguiling offers to share \nknowledge and experience. A steady stream of economists arrived from abroad, bringing advice \navidly assimilated by young reformers. Chicago School neoliberalism was in vogue. Russian \nadmirers, hastening to disown the communist faith, were won over. Many of these proselytes \nbecame even more orthodox than their new ideological heroes.15 \nThe market reform programmes induced new ways of thinking about financial control \nand regulation, including auditing. Simultaneously, auditing came to be located outside and \ninside markets. On the one hand, Western auditing came to be seen as an element of market-\nindependent institutional infrastructure supporting the establishment of market relations \namongst enterprises, and between enterprises and investors. As a mechanism of independent \ncontrol, auditing should help prevent asset stripping, improve the presentation of financial \ninformation, and ensure compliance with new market-oriented regulations and standards \n(Danilevsky, 1991, 1994; IMF et al., 1991, p. 53). On the other hand, auditing activities \nthemselves were to be organised along principles and images of market rationality. To \nenhance their effectiveness, so it was believed, financial inspections had to be detached from \n\u201cthe apparatuses of political rule\u201d (Rose, 1993, p. 285). Financial audit experts were to be re-\n                                                 \n15 The neoliberal reform programme outlined by Western economic advisers, such as Sachs, \u00c5slund and Shleifer, \nand multilateral institutions, such as the OECD, World Bank and IMF, recommended the rapid liberalisation of \nforeign trade, fiscal austerity and swift privatisation (IMF et al., 1991; Lieberman et al., 1995; World Bank, \n1996). It was informed by the so-called \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d, neoliberal reform policies aimed at fiscal \nstabilisation, privatisation and liberalisation outlined by the World Bank and IMF in the late 1980s to rescue \nstates in economic crisis (Harvey, 2005). Following the Western recommendations, on 2 January 1992, Yegor \nGaidar (then acting Russian prime minister), launched the so-called \u201cshock therapy\u201d programme promoting \nlaissez-faire capitalism through the sudden removal of price controls, the liberalisation of trade and large-scale \nprivatisation (Arbatov, 2001). \n 19\nlocated within (imagined) markets \u201cgoverned by the rationalities of competition, \naccountability and consumer demand\u201d. As Danilevsky (1991, p. 6) writes:  \nThe activities of auditors should be guided by legislation and private [sobstvenny] and economic \n[khozraschetny] interests. Conditions of competition within the auditing business allow \neconomically for quality in the carrying out of inspections [revizii] and controls. In turn, \nenterprises have the possibility to choose a qualified partner (auditor) who is independent from the \ndepartmental inspectorates, and the government is given the possibility to ensure control over the \nreliability [dostovernost'] of financial statements and the correctness of tax calculations without \nhaving to spend its governmental budget resources. \nState-independent, self-financed commercial audit firms [khozraschetnye auditorskie \norganizatsii] came to be identified as the main instruments through which market-oriented \nreform objectives could be realised: \nThe development of a web of audit firms can lay down the beginning of a genuine establishment \nof economic principles of financial control, based on contractual, commercial relations between \nthe auditors and the controlled enterprises and other organisations. (Danilevsky, 1991, p. 6) \nAudit firms came to be advanced as entities through which the old Soviet control \nsystem could be \u201cadapted to the requirements of a the market economy\u201d (Itkin, 1991, p. 20); \nthrough which \u201creliable [dostoverny] financial information\u201d could be produced allowing for \n\u201cthe enhancement of capital market efficiency\u201d and \u201cevaluation and forecasting of \nconsequences of economic decision-making\u201d (Sheremet & Suyts, 2001 [1995], p. 11). Such \nbeliefs, to a great extent, were rooted in highly idealised Western accounts. Western \ndiscourses on audit functionality were called upon to promote and legitimate the rise of \ncommercially organised audit expertise (Danilevsky, 1991, 1995a, b; Sheremet & Suyts, 2001 \n[1995]; Solov'ev, 1988; Terekhov, 2001; Tsyplenkov, 1994).16 Further, the large international \naccounting firms had opened their first offices in Russia in the late 1980s (Cooper, \nGreenwood, Hinings & Brown, 1998). The presence and economic success of the then Big \nSix strengthened beliefs that the establishment of private audit firms constituted an \nappropriate response to the political and economic reform demands. In the eyes of the Russian \nreformers and new auditors, the big firms \u201cdemonstrated the need for professional services\u201d \n(Pyatenko, 1998, p. 9), and they set an example of how auditing ought to be organised. Ernst \n                                                 \n16 In 1993, for example, one of the first Russian commercial audit firms \u201cKontakt\u201d (later FBK) initiated the \ntranslation of Robertson\u2019s audit textbook [Robertson, J.C., 1976: Auditing. Burr Ridge: Business Publications]. \nIn 1995, the economics professors Terekhov and Sokolov translated the fifth edition of Arens and Loebbecke\u2019s \ntextbook [Arens, E.A. and J.K. Loebbecke, 1991: Auditing, an integrated approach. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice \nHall]. In the same year, Sokolov translated the \u201cAudit Framework\u201d by Adams [Adams, R. 1993: Audit \nFramework. London: ACCA]. In addition, a translation of Carmichael and Benis\u2019s \u201cAuditing Standards and \nProcedures Manual\u201d appeared [Carmichael, D.R. and M. Benis, 1994: Auditing Standards and Procedures \nManual 1994. London: John Wiley, also translated in 1995]. \n 20\nand Young established their first offices in Moscow in 1989. Coopers and Lybrand, Arthur \nAndersen and KPMG followed in 1990, and Deloitte and Touche launched their Russian \noffices in 1992. Subsequent to the joint venture regulations in 1987, the international \naccounting firms had followed new Western joint venture partners into Russia, as most of \nthem needed a Western audit for their Western parent companies (Cooper et al., 1998).17 \nLater, from 1990 onwards, the big firms, along with newly founded Russian audit firms, \nconducted also audits for co-operatives and banks.18 The activities of the Big Six, the opening \nup of the Soviet Union for foreign direct investment, and the introduction of new forms of \nprivate property reinforced beliefs that the old Soviet inspection apparatus needed to be \nreplaced with a system of commercial auditing run by private audit firms. \nYet, the actual working of auditing still needed to be figured out. As Power (1997, p. \n42) would put it, the efficacy of auditing was a priori assumed. Neither the actual working of \naudit, nor its technologies were problematised. As the following remark of a former employee \nof the Soviet Ministry of Finance19 illustrates, the advent of auditing, at first, had the \nappearance of a fashion. Economic reformers deemed it to be more appropriate to control \ncommercial, market-oriented operations through commercial audits rather than the old system \nof state inspection \u2013 without considering what the exact implications of such a change would \nbe: \nBecause the government [\u2026] allowed the foundation of enterprises with foreign capital, and even \nfurther, the foundation of enterprises with capital from capitalist countries, it would have looked \nvery strange, if a part of the state control apparatus would have controlled these organisations. [\u2026] \nAt that time it was quite fashionable to set up audit firms. An understanding of the meaning and \nroles of this institution [of auditing] did not exist. The procurators [inspectorates] would assign \nauditors and the auditor would do the controls [for them]. Auditing was seen as an instrument that \ncould be employed to delegate control, state controls. And it was just fashionable, instead of \nsetting up a control-inspection apparatus within the state structures, to create such an apparatus \nthrough audit firms. In the West that exists, so why shouldn\u2019t we have the same? \n                                                 \n17 The joint venture law from 1987 stimulated the rise of auditing, as it required that joint venture partners \nunderwent an audit, instead of the traditional state inspections. However, the law itself is only one factor among \nmany that contributed to Russian audit development. The law itself does not explain the rise of auditing. For this, \nwe have to look at the wider conditions of its emergence, including political changes, problematisations of state \nfinancial control and the opening of Russia to the West. \n18 A new Banking Law, adopted in December 1990, stated that the financial statements of commercial banks \nwere to be checked by an independent audit organisation. Also the Enterprise Law and the revised Law on Co-\noperatives, issued in 1990, introduced audits as a means of external financial control and required these to be \nconducted by commercial auditing organisations. \n19 In 2002, when this interview was conducted, the interviewee worked as a partner for a Big Four audit firm in \nMoscow and was responsible for the development of internationally oriented accounting and audit methodology. \n 21\nSoviet inspection practices, thus, began to be reframed under the label of auditing, but \nwithout it being clear where the reform attempts were heading. Reform activities were based \non a range of ideas about what Western auditing in Russia might look like, without these \nideas being anchored firmly in agreed, uncontroversial definitions of auditing. In the \nbeginning, the term \u201cauditing\u201d was primarily used to demarcate a new control area, namely \nthe control of commercial operations carried out by joint ventures and other entities with \nmixed or exclusively private funding, rather than to denote changes in actual inspection \npractice and technology. A former state financial inspector, who in 2002, at the time of this \ninterview, was Deputy Director of one of the Big Four audit firms in Moscow, remembers: \nWhen we heard the word \u201caudit\u201d for the first time we were confronted with a series of new \nquestions. Amongst other things, we asked ourselves what we should look at [when carrying out \naudits]. The major control organ at that time was the Ministry of Finance; we worked with their \nquestions. [\u2026] And, obviously, what we did during these times, that wasn\u2019t an audit in the sense \nas we understand it today. It was more like\u2026the procedures were more like\u2026 \u2013 [\u2026] More like the \ninspections you carried out before? \u2013 Yes, yes, exactly. \nThe practical meaning of audits, and what made them distinct from governmental \ninspections, still had to be worked out. This problem arose partly out of the general obscurity \nthat, as Power (1997) shows, characterises the business of auditing, whether in the East or the \nWest. It arose also out of a lack of first-hand experience in Western auditing and resistance \naccompanying the reform attempts. On the one hand, auditing had become attached to \nneoliberal reform demands, ideals of market-coordinated action, competition and laissez-faire. \nOn the other hand, there were still many voices, within and outside government, seeking to \nrestore the old command and control regime and state authority. Old inspection ideals, \ncoalescing auditing with ideas of \u201clawfulness\u201d [zakonnost\u2019], juridical enforcement and \ngovernmental oversight, rather than market accountability and consumer rights, lived on (see \ne.g. Shpig & Lazurenko, 1991). \nMoreover, the neoliberal ideas and programmes of marketisation themselves were not \nas homogeneous as, at first, they may have appeared. We cannot speak of one unitary \nneoliberal or market logic (Harvey, 2005; Ong, 2006). Rather, we have to acknowledge the \nmultiple visions and rationales that can become connected to audit, marketisation and neo-\nliberal reform ideas. In the name of \u201cthe market\u201d and neoliberalism, a range of different ideas \nand instruments can get mobilised, which put different emphasis on different aspects of neo-\nliberal government (Aldridge, 2005; Hirschman, 1992). In the case of Russia, marketisation, \n 22\nand neoliberalism respectively, came to be defined as opposite to planning and bureaucratic \ncoordination, at the same time market-oriented reform policies themselves required a lot of \norganisation and re-regulation. At an abstract level, neoliberalism and marketisation came to \nbe understood as freedom to self-organisation, individual responsibilisation and increased \naccountability (\u00c5slund, 1995; Gorbachev, 1987; see also Rose, 1999). At the level of audit \norganisation, they came to be interpreted in terms of economic calculation, rationing, and \ncompetition (Danilevsky, 1990, 1991; but see also Kurunm\u00e4ki & Miller, 2006). At the \nbeginning of Russia\u2019s transition to capitalism, \u201cthe market\u201d came to be regarded as a \ndisciplining and \u201ccivilizing\u201d mechanism (Gaidar, 2003; Gorbachev, 1987; Hirschman, 1992, \n1997 [1977]; IMF et al., 1991). Later, when many of the reforms did not turn out as planned, \n\u201cthe market\u201d came also to be seen as merely opening up possibilities for bare profit seeking, \nopportunistic enrichment, free riding and ruthlessness (Burawoy, 2001; Klein & Pomer, \n2001). Following a linked ecologies approach, we need to make more room for such multiple \nviews and interpretations that came to be attached to audit and processes of marketisation. \nFurther, abstract, idealised discourses about marketisation and auditing alone cannot \nhelp us explain how auditing, and new audit firms respectively, came to work (or not work). \nNor can they add to our understanding of the many shifts, contradictions, dynamics and \ntensions accompanying attempts to transform post-socialist inspection in the light of Western \nmarket ideals. For this, we have to look at the messy translation of the ideals. A linked \necologies approach, as put forward in this paper, seeks to unravel the manifold connections \nthat came to be established between audit reform programmes and different instruments and \nideals of marketisation. Ecological analysis, as Wise (1988, p. 77) has put it, draws attention \nto the \u201cparticular modes of mediation through which societal concerns become projected into \nthe very local concerns of a particular domain\u201d of activity. In so doing, ecological analysis \nasks us not only to analyse the governmental programmes that gave rise to audit. It also asks \nus to investigate how the market and audit reform requests came to be rearticulated at local \nlevel, translated and shifted into sub-programmes, counter-programmes, and attached to \ntechnologies involved in the day-to-day construction and legitimation of claims to audit \nexpertise. \n 23\nChanging relations between politics and expertise \nIn post-Soviet Russia, particularly in the early 1990s, many reformers believed that \nnew market institutions (including auditing) would arise almost automatically, if institutions \nof the old system were destroyed (see e.g. Boycko et al., 1995). Yet, the anticipated transition \ndid not come about (Burawoy & Verdery, 1999; Pickles & Smith, 1998). The reforms carved \nspace for new forms of private entrepreneurship, but did not automatically lead to greater \ndegrees of accountability, transparency and individual responsibility, or changes in inspection \ntechnology. People, including accountants and auditors, as Stark and Bruszt (1998) aptly \npoint out, were not wondering how to transit to \u201cthe market\u201d. They were more concerned \nabout how to survive with the resources at hand and how to cope with the high degrees of \ninstitutional uncertainty. Thus, market-oriented reform programmes did not result in clearly \nidentifiable pathways of change. Rather, as the following sections show, they opened up \nspaces for experimentation and pluralisation. Auditing itself came to be implied in such \nspaces of experimentation and pluralisation. At government level, demands for auditing had \nbeen articulated, but tasks of audit still had to be defined, and differences between socialist \ninspection and market-oriented auditing to be worked out. \nThe market relevance of auditing had to be actively built and rebuilt, with tools that \nare not necessarily directly related to calculative proficiency or actual degrees of scrutiny. \nRussian audit entrepreneurs and their firms actively participated in the construction of the \nmarkets they sought to rule. Audit had to be turned into an economic business before audit \nitself could take place, and audit ideas came to be merged with Western marketing and \nconsulting expertise.20 Western marketing instruments (client questionnaires, audit firm \nratings, advertisements, brochures etc.) came to be used to erect boundaries between the \npresent and the past, gain public visibility and build up new systems of audit representation.21 \n                                                 \n20 This, of course, is not only a specificity of auditing in post-Soviet Russia. Discourses seeking to redefine and \nmarket auditing in consulting terms also took place in the West, in the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly before \nthe Enron scandal (see e.g. Jeppesen, 1998; Robson et al., 2007). Yet differently from the West, in Russia \ndiscourses about consulting emerged at the same time when auditing was introduced, and not as something that \nwas added on to audit. \n21 In the context of this paper, systems of audit representation are defined as systems of signifying practices and \nsymbolic systems (Hall, 1997) through which audit meanings are produced, and which help position audit firms \nand auditors as market actors in envisaged audit markets. This paper argues that symbolic systems play an \nimportant role in creating possibilities of what auditing is and who auditors are. Discourses and systems of \n 24\nThe next section describes and analyses how auditors actively tried to make audit \nmarketable. It shows how auditors sought to reinvent themselves as market actors through \nreferences to managerial efficiency, economic successfulness, client care and \ncompetitiveness. Projects aimed at increasing professional status and external recognition \ncame to be carried forward at the level of audit firms and their positioning in the emerging \naudit market (e.g. via audit firm ratings, client questionnaires and other marketing \ninstruments). Notions of good or bad, professional or unprofessional, auditing came to be \nlinked to audit firm size, audit firm branding, and corporate influence. In this context, large \nWestern professional services firms (particularly the then Big Six and other large mid-tier \naccounting firms) came to function as role models, as market organisations to compete with \nand learn from. They came to be seen as strongholds of Western audit and marketing \nexpertise, with structures at their disposal through which, so it was hoped, at least parts of the \nemerging Russian audit market could be remodelled, modernised and connected to the West. \nThe meaning of markets and the roles of auditing in them, thus, was reworked. \nAttention came to be shifted away from textbook ideals seeing auditing as a mechanism to \nreduce information asymmetry, to enhance accountability and to add credibility to financial \nreports.22 Auditing was redefined as platform for corporate development, consulting activities \nand entrepreneurial self-realisation. With this, also market ideals changed. Markets were no \nlonger seen as an abstract mechanism of economic coordination, but as a space for \nexperimentation, which needed to be actively created, crafted and shaped, by the audit firms \nthemselves and their representational instruments. \nMaking audit marketable \nUntil 1993, auditing itself remained a largely unregulated business. In 1994, this \nsituation was changed. The government adopted Temporary Rules on Auditing, which for the \n                                                                                                                                                        \nrepresentation construct places from which auditors and audit firms can position themselves and from which they \ncan speak to each other and larger publics. \n22 See e.g. Danilevsky et al. (2002), Sherement and Suyts (2001 [1995]), Suyts et al. (2001). Sheremet and Suyts \n(2001 [1995]) wrote one of the first Russian audit textbooks for students at the Moscow State University. \nFollowing Western textbooks (Arens and Loebbecke [1995], Adams [1995], Robertson [1993]) and principal \nagenct theory, they describe auditing as a device \u201cto overcome information asymmetries\u201d, \u201cto increase the \ntrustworthiness of financial information\u201d, \u201cto evaluate and forecast the consequences of different economic \ndecisions\u201d and \u201cto enhance capital market efficiency\u201d.  \n 25\nfirst time laid out a definition of auditing, and officially granted audit firms a key position \nwithin the system of economic and financial control that was to be reformed. The Temporary \nRules defined auditing as: \n[\u2026] entrepreneurial activity of auditors (audit firms) involving independent, non-governmental \ncontrols of accounting (financial) reports, payment and settlement documents, tax declarations and \nother financial obligations and requirements of economic entities and the provision of other \nauditing services. (Quoted from Danilevsky, 1994, p. 9) \nThe adoption of the Temporary Rules constituted an important further step in the \nmarketisation of audit services. Subsequent to the Temporary Rules, audits became \nmandatory for a large number of companies.23 Audits came to be officially relocated within \ncommercial, state-independent audit firms, which were free to decide on the forms, methods \nand contents of the checks they carried out.24 Groups of audit experts and audit organisations \nofficially were put into competing positions. Audit services were redefined as commercial, \ntradable good. Auditing itself came to be seen as \u201centrepreneurial activity\u201d \n[predprinimatel\u2019skaya deyatel\u2019nost\u2019], and auditee organisations were free to choose among a \nhost of newly established audit suppliers. \nBetween 1991 and 1996, the number of new audit firms increased rapidly. In 1991, at \nthe early beginnings of Russian audit development, an auditing conference was held in \nMoscow in which more than 180 audit firms participated (Terekhov, 2001, p. 64). A few \nyears later, the number of audit firms amounted to more than 2,000 (ibid.). In 1996, more than \n3,000 audit firms operated in Russia, and by 2001 this number had increased to 7,500 (see \nTable 1 below).25 \nInsert Table 1 about here \nYet, to both the new audit producers and consumers it was still not entirely clear what \ndistinguished auditing from former inspection activities apart from the new commercial \n                                                 \n23 Audits became mandatory for unlimited joint-stock companies, banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges, \ninvestment institutions, charitable funds, joint ventures and companies with a turnover of more than 500,000 \nminimum monthly salaries (ca. 7 Million USD) or total assets in excess of 200,000 minimum monthly salaries \n(ca. 3 Million USD) (Enthoven et al., 1998, p. 87). These requirements were specified in a governmental \nresolution from 7.12.1994 (No. 1355). According to the Russian business journal Profil\u2019 in March 2002 more \nthan 20% of all businesses had to undergo mandatory audits (Profil\u2019, 11 March 2002, p. 78). \n24 See Article 13 of the Temporary Rules: \u201cAuditors and audit firms have the right to define methods and forms \nof audit controls themselves, provided that they do not conflict with the legal framework of the Russian \nFederation.\u201d \n25 The auditors interviewed in this study came from a variety of different backgrounds. Some had worked in \nscience labs as mathematicians; some had an engineering or background. Others had taken MBA degrees abroad. \nOnly a few had formerly worked as state financial inspectors; and many had only received their university \ndegrees some years ago. \n 26\nattributes. What one could or should demand from mandatory audit services still had to be \nspecified. Relations between auditor and auditee had to be figured out, and evaluation criteria \nfor \u201cgood\u201d auditing to be defined. Different attempts began to be undertaken by the new audit \nentrepreneurs and their founded audit firms to make audit reputable and marketable, to \nposition themselves in the emerging post-Soviet audit market, and redefine their identity in \naccordance with market ideals. In this context, attention was drawn in particular to marketing \nexpertise and market-oriented instruments of audit firm representation \u2013 public \nadvertisements, audit firm rankings, press articles etc. \u2013 to communicate, ground, sell and \nlegitimate claims to new competence, mark differences between Soviet and post-Soviet audit \npractices, establish new grids of classification, and distinguish \u201creal\u201d from \u201cquack\u201d \nprofessionals. \nAttempts aimed at making audit reputable (and thereby marketable), thus, were not \nonly rooted in the development of a new knowledge base, Western-oriented audit \nmethodologies and traditional mechanisms of professional regulation (e.g. professional \nstandards, ethical codes and certificates). At least equally important were activities and \ninstruments of marketing and branding aimed at the publicising and general promotion of \nauditing and audit firms. Activities and instruments aimed at making auditing widely \n\u201cpresentable\u201d and \u201ccommunicable\u201d came to the fore. New forms of market representation \nwere invented to make auditing and audit firms publicly known, construct status hierarchies \nbetween small and large firms, reinforce ideas of market-guided auditor choice, and \ndemonstrate competitiveness. In this context, ideals of auditing came to be intertwined and \nreframed with ideas and instruments of consulting, management and marketing. The \nfollowing passages examine how auditing and market ideals came to be carried forward, \nshifted and changed through the new audit entrepreneurs, their audit firms and \nrepresentational instruments. Three instances of post-Soviet audit re-branding and re-\npresentation are analysed. \nFirst, changing representations of relations between subject and object of auditing, \nbetween auditor and auditee, are investigated. It is shown how notions of auditing as \ninstrument of verification and market-control came to be shifted and remoulded by auditors \nand audit firms seeking to reinvent themselves as \u201cdoctors who heal\u201d in order to leave stigmas \n 27\nof socialist inspection behind, distinguish themselves from sham professionals, legitimate \nentrepreneurial inventiveness and reemphasise customer orientation. Second, it is shown how \nimageries of auditors as \u201cdoctors who heal\u201d are not only utilised to reinforce differences \nbetween the present and the past; they are also used to restage old aspirations of \norganisational efficiency and, to some extend, defend continuity in audit methodology. Third, \nwe turn to the embedding and re-articulation of market-oriented audit ideals in inter-\norganisational constructions of market credibility, and analyse the relevance of audit firm \nrankings in newspapers and popular business magazines for the construction and legitimation \nof new claims to expertise. We observe the re-invoking of market ideals in terms of inter-\norganisational competition and demonstrations of corporate powerfulness. But we also see \nthat this does not necessarily imply that former Soviet calculative practices and inspection \ntechnologies are entirely changed or replaced; first of all, they rather are rewrapped and \nrestaged \u2013 with the help of Western ideas and instruments of market creation, representation \nand organisational management. \nDoctors who heal \nHere [in Russia] you find firms who really perform audits and you have firms who just call \nthemselves audit firms. That is a big difference. You have doctors who heal. They know what they \nare doing; they are experienced. But you also have people who just wear white collars. They just \ntake your money and give you a certification that you are healthy and that you are not going to die \nsoon. (Director of a large Russian audit firm) \n \nAn auditor comes to a firm to express his opinion. He does not come with the objective to punish \nor fine. He comes with the objective to find out whether there are any shortcomings; and he will \ninform the management of the company about these shortcomings, which means that we don\u2019t \npenalise. (Senior Auditor of another large Russian audit firm) \n \nAn auditor \u2013 that\u2019s not just a person who comes to express an opinion on the financial statements; \npeople expect him also to tell them how things should be done, they expect advice. [If you] say \nthat an audit is about the support [podderzheniye] of a true and fair view, the management of a \ncompany would not understand this. And they don\u2019t care. They think: \u2018If we hire auditors and pay \nthem money, they ought to tell us how all this [the accounting] should be done, so that we don\u2019t \nface problems with the tax authorities.\u2019 If an auditor does not help the enterprise to get the \naccounting and computation of taxes right, the enterprise would choose another auditor the next \ntime. (Audit Manager of another large Russian audit firm) \nIn the early 1990s auditing had been introduced and put on a market footing, but \npotential audit clients were not necessarily convinced that auditing constituted a valuable, \nworthy activity. Professional standards were largely absent or, if present, rarely enforced. \nMarkets, including the emerging market for audit services, came to be experienced by many \nas being \u201cout of control\u201d, as wild and uncivilized spaces \u201cwhere anything goes\u201d. Furthermore, \n 28\nstigmas of Soviet inspection continued to live on and were often attached to auditing, too. As \nwas pointed out earlier, during Soviet times neither bookkeeping nor inspection enjoyed a \nhigh status or good reputation. In order to expand their businesses, enhance public credibility \nand trustworthiness, the new auditors needed to counteract the old stereotypes and imageries. \nIn so doing, they did not only need to develop new technical skills and a new knowledge base, \nthey also needed to find ways and instruments allowing for their public re-staging, proactive \nimpression management and communication of their worth. \nIn doing so, individual auditors and their firms, inter alia, began to emphasise the \nmetaphorical similarity between auditing and other respected, established occupations. As \nwith the US-American management consulting profession in the 1930s (McKenna, 2006, p. \n201), Russian auditors too began to describe their activities in terms of medical analogies. \nAuditors and audit firms, seeking to distinguish themselves from past inspectors and sham \nprofessionals, promoted themselves as \u201cdoctors who heal\u201d, and commercial auditing as \nmedicine for the ailing economy. In various journal articles, books, advertisements and public \nspeeches auditors presented themselves as \u201cdoctors of the economy\u201d [doktory ot ekonomiki], \nas \u201cphysicians for the bookkeeper\u201c [vrachi dlya bukhgaltera] (Baklan, 1988; Pyatenko, 1998, \n2001). Notions of control [kontrol] and inspection [reviziya] came to be reworked and \nintertwined with notions of guidance, help [pomosh] and competent advice [gramotny sovet] \n(Pyatenko, 1998). Whereas former Soviet inspectors continued to be portrayed as watchdogs, \nas policemen who want to expose mistakes, punish and collect fines, auditors sought to re-\nbrand themselves as consultants, helpers, and accounting advisors (Pyatenko, 1998, 2001; \nSuyts et al., 2001; Terekhov, 2001). In the accounting journal Bukhgalterskii uchet we read: \nAuditors are no longer the state inspectors [revizory] from yesterday, whose task it was to find \nerrors and breaches. The auditor of today is an adviser [sovietchik] to the owner, entrepreneur and \nbookkeeper. Qualified consulting services are often more needed than the audit itself. \n(Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1998, No. 8, p. 8) \nA shift is articulated from socialist inspection to Western-oriented business consulting \n(see also Baklan, 1988; Pyatenko, 1998, 2001). Medical metaphors came to be blended with \nWestern consulting ideals. They were not so much used to root auditing in ideals of science, \nbut to articulate characteristics of (Western) management consulting, emphasise the \nimportance of client\/patient care, discretion\/doctor-patient confidentiality and state \nindependence: \n 29\nIt is important that [audit] organisations [\u2026] emphasise in their regulations and contracts the \nconsulting and confidential character of their offered services, avoiding the words \u201cinspection and \ncontrol\u201d [reviziya i control]. In the opinion of the leaders of the organisations, their client will only \nbe interested in their services, if he is convinced that the results of the accomplished work will \nonly be communicated to him, and the objective of the work does not consist in an attempt to wash \none\u2019s dirty linen in public. (Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1988, No. 11, p. 11) \nBefore statutory audits were widely introduced, many audit firms worked as \naccounting consulting organisations [khozraschetnye konsul\u2019tativnye organizatsii].26 \nModelling themselves on Western accounting and consulting firms, they later relabelled \nthemselves as audit-consulting firms [auditorsko-konsul\u2019tatsionnye firmy], and auditors \nreferred to themselves as auditor-consultants [auditory-konsultanty] (see e.g. Pyatenko, 1998). \nRusssian audit firms, which in 2005 for example belonged to Russia\u2019s five largest national \naudit firms, started under names such as Unicon (Universal Consulting)27, or FBK \n(Finansovye i bukhgalterskie konsultatsii \u2013 Financial and bookkeeping advice), which they \ncontinued to carry. Consulting images were invoked not only to reinforce distance from old \ninspection imageries, but also to legitimate the profit orientation of the new audit firms and \ncommunicate, akin to Western audit firms in the 1980s and 1990s (Hinings et al., 1999; \nJeppesen, 1998; Robson et al., 2007), the \u201cadded value\u201d of their services to potential clients. \nThe presence of the Big Six (later Big Five and then Big Four) accounting firms in \nRussia from the late 1980s onwards had a major impact on such developments. The big firms \nwere seen as role models who had successfully embraced a competitive market orientation. \nTheir multifaceted business engagements reconfirmed beliefs that auditing should \u201ccombine \nthe function of control with consulting and legal advice\u201d (Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1993, No. 2, \np. 10). The entrepreneurial success of the big firms, their client orientation and general \n                                                 \n26 See for example the article in the journal Bukhgalterskii uchet by Baklan (1988), a representative of the \ninspection apparatus of the Soviet Ministry of Finance, describing the foundation of Soviet accounting \nconsulting firms in the late 1980s. Amongst other things, he describes the activities of \u201cFinansy\u201d, a consulting \nfirm in Tbilisi founded in 1987 to offer services in the areas of financial economic analysis, management \nconsulting and legal compliance work; \u201cTook\u201d, an Estonian firm offering legal advisory services and consulting \nin finance; and \u201cEkspert\u201d, a Moscow firm providing consulting services to newly founded cooperatives in \naccounting and bookkeeping. \n27 Andrei Dubinsky, founder and director of Unicon comments on the company name on the audit firm\u2019s \nwebsite: \u201c[\u2026] the name should include the word \u201cconsulting\u201d or a part of it to reflect the universal nature of our \nservices. Furthermore, it should show that we are going to become part of the global system in the future, that \nour professional roots are international. At the same time I wanted a good-sounding name. That is how the name \n\u201cUnicon\u201d was born \u2013 its first part \u201cuni\u201d stands for \u201cuniversal\u201d; its second part \u201ccon\u201d is for \u201cconsulting\u201d. If we \nlook at it in a different way, \u201cunic\u201d sounds similar to \u201cunique\u201d. The ultimate meaning would be \u201cunique \nconsulting\u201d, and I believe it is true.\u201d See http:\/\/www.bdo.ru\/eng\/about\/history\/index.wbp (accessed in August \n2008). \n 30\nmanagement expertise, came to be seen as important preconditions for professional audit \ndevelopment (see e.g. Pyatenko, 1998, and Bukhgalterskii uchet, 1992, No. 4, pp. 8).  \nSupported were such views by articles from owners of smaller Western accounting \nfirms, which began to be published by Bukhgalterskii uchet regularly from the early 1990s \nonwards. In 1992 for example, the journal published an article by Thomas Telling, an \nAmerican accounting firm owner, entitled \u201cAccounting firms in the market economy\u201d. \nTelling wrote: \nAccounting firms offer clients all complex accounting services, which the client himself cannot \ncarry out. [\u2026] Accounting firms help business people. [\u2026] They can help prepare budgets, offer \nvaluation services, prepare accounts for tax authorities and provide other services. (Bukhgalterskii \nuchet, 1992, No. 12, pp. 21) \nAccording to a survey, published in the journal Bukhgalterskii uchet in 1995, the \nmajority of Russian audit firms offered consulting services to their clients. They sought to \nprotect their clients from the grip of tax authorities, prepared business and financial plans for \nthem, provided advice on accounting policies, and helped clients adapt to the fast changing \nregulatory environment (Podolsky, Savin & Sotnikova, 1995). Bare audits, in this context, \nwere often regarded as being of secondary importance. By many (including auditors and \nauditees) they came to be seen as \u201cnecessary formality\u201d, \u201cnot yet a really effective element in \nthe market economy\u201d, \u201cnot an instrument of societal control over the commercial activities of \nenterprises and organisations\u201d (see e.g. Stukov, 1996, p. 38). As Stukov (1996, p. 39) put it: \n\u201cIn the best case audits are tolerated, but they are not liked\u201d. Consequently, audits as such \nenjoyed limited credibility. Even in 2002 we can read in a widely disseminated Russian audit \ntextbook (see Danilevsky et al., 2002, p. 98): \u201cWhen granting loans, banks often employ non-\nofficial information about the real situation of the potential client rather than trust his financial \nstatements, although they have been approved by a licensed auditor.\u201d \nAgainst the background of such articulations of distrust, marketing and skilful public \nimpression management became important topics for the newly established firms, especially \nfor those with bigger business aspirations (e.g. FBK, Unicon, Rufaudit). Western-oriented \nmarketing strategies, combined with ideas of strategic management, began to be adopted to \nunderline professionalism, client orientation and entrepreneurial ability (Pyatenko, 1998, \n2001; Vedeneev, 1999). Key account management, SWOT analyses (analyses of strengths, \n 31\nweaknesses, opportunities and threats), and PR work began to enter in particular larger firms \n(see e.g. Pyatenko, 2001; Verkhov & Kozlova, 1998).28 \nFurther, firms like FBK, Rufaudit and Unicon founded their own publishing houses. \nThey issued journals for accounting and audit practitioners, were involved in the setting up of \naudit business associations29, published translations of Western accounting and audit \ntextbooks, and issued their own books and articles. These carried titles, such as \u201cChoosing an \nauditor and consultant\u201d (Pyatenko, 1998), \u201cThe auditor comes to the bookkeeper to help\u201d \n(Antipin & Badalin, 1994), \u201cThe foundation and development perspectives of a market for \naudit-consulting services in Russia\u201d (Pyatenko, 1997), or \u201cThe marketing of audit services\u201d \n(Vedeneev, 1999). They sent their employees to give public speeches (e.g. at conference), and \nfounded their own PR, marketing and strategic business development departments with the \naim \u201cstop auditing from being poorly understood\u201d and re-emphasise its \u201cusefulness for the \ndevelopment of the market\u201d (Voronaev, 1994).30 Audit firms and their founders began to \nportray themselves as active audit market organisers \u2013 actively forming themselves, audit \nexpectations, and their competitive environment (Pyatenko, 1997, 1998). \nMarket success came to be promoted as a sign of professionalism, and organisational \ncompetence of audit firms as the main vehicle through which high levels of audit \nprofessionalism could be realised. Displays of entrepreneurial success, shown in newspaper \narticles, business journals and audit firm advertisements, came not only to be utilised for the \nattraction of new clients, but, as the following sections will show, also for the general \n                                                 \n28 Pyatenko, for example, extensively refers to the English and American consulting and marketing literature and \nquotes Maister (1993), Managing the Professional Service Firm, New York: Free Press; the Handbook of \nManagement Consulting Services by S.W. Barcus and J.W. Wilkinson, 1995, New York: McGraw-Hill; and \nPeoples, D.A. (1993), Selling to the Top, New York: John Wiley. \n29 The two founders of Rufaudit, Alexey and Alexander Ruf, founded in 1992 the Russian Collegium of \nAuditors. In 1996, under the leadership of the audit firm Unicon, the Union of Professional Audit Organisations \n(SPAO, which became later renamed into IPAR, Institute of Professional Audit Firms in Russia) was founded. \nTemporarily, the number of audit associations amounted to more than 100. Following the introduction of the \nFederal Audit Law in 2002, and the requirement for governmental accreditation of such associations, this \nnumber was eventually cut down to five officially recognised organisations (see \nhttp:\/\/www1.minfin.ru\/common\/img\/uploaded\/library\/2009\/02\/peresh_apao.pdf, accessed in June 2009). With \nthe exemption of the RCA, all associations accept audit firms as their members. The associations are primarily \nseen as a platform for auditors and audit firms to defend their business interests. Membership in them has never \nbeen compulsory and audit certificates were, and still are, not issued by them, but the Ministry of Finance. \n30 In 1996, the Russian business magazine Ekspert published a survey where the then 20 largest Russian audit \nfirms (in terms of revenues) were asked to list the main factors that contributed to their economic success and \ncontinuing competitiveness on the audit market. Amongst the most important factors mentioned were: \u201cgood \nrelations with national enterprises (potential clients)\u201d, \u201cprofessionalism of employees\u201d and \u201ccomprehension of \nthe client\u2019s psychology\u201d. See Ekspert, 1996, No. 35, p. 32; reprinted in Terekhov (2001, pp. 196-197). \n 32\nenhancement of public recognition and respect. Similar to the case of the US-American \nmanagement consulting field (McKenna, 2006, p. 203), and the case of the large international \naccounting firms (Cooper & Robson, 2006; Greenwood et al., 2006), professionalism came to \nbe seen as a characteristic of individual firms and their capacities for efficient organisation \nand business development, rather than as the property of individuals. Attributes of \norganisational proficiency and corporate powerfulness, the next section shows, came to be \nutilised to articulate professionalism. In this context, special attention was devoted once more \nto the large Western accounting firms and their ways of organising expertise. At the same \ntime, however, practices aimed at increasing organisational rigour and discipline provided \nalso old inspection ideals with new relevance. \n\u201cCivilizing markets\u201d: Organisational proficiency and accounting hygiene \nBetween 1989 and 1995 audit-consulting, like any other Russian business, developed basically on \na combination of indomitable spirit and entrepreneurial energy. [\u2026] Independently, a well \ndeveloped and flourishing new branch of the economy came to be formed. More importantly, \nauditors and consultants, ahead of almost everyone, paved the way for a life in accordance with the \nlaws of the market economy and competition. The sphere of professional [audit and consulting] \nservices already itself constitutes a clear example of the possibility to form and develop normal, \nindependent, market laws abiding organisations. (Pyatenko, 2001, pp. 119, 329) \nAuditing came to be regarded as a sphere of business where market relations were \nrealised. Auditors and audit firms sought to actively embrace market ideas. They promoted \nthemselves as entrepreneurs, as \u201cmotors\u201d of the audit machinery, \u201coriented towards the \nfuture\u201d (Pyatenko, 1998, p. 37). Pyatenko, deputy director and partner of FBK, distinguishing \nbetween audit specialists and audit entrepreneurs for example wrote: \nExperience and knowledge of the [audit] specialist does not mean much without the work of the \nmanager and [audit] entrepreneur. [\u2026] The entrepreneur is the motor of the machine, oriented \ntowards the future. He is a creator, a strategist, a founder and developer of new markets and the \nmethods of their mastering. (Pyatenko, 1998, pp. 37-39) \nImages of audit entrepreneurialism came to be utilised to underline the market \norientation of the audit sector, stress its progressiveness and, thereby, reinforce distinctions \nbetween the past and the present \u2013 between old worlds of passive, rule-abiding bureaucratic \ninspection and bookkeeping and new worlds of Western-oriented accounting and auditing. In \naccordance with market ideals, the economic success of an audit firm came to be promoted as \na sign of organisational efficiency, competent management and professionalism (Guttseit & \nOstrovsky, 1998; Pyatenko, 1997, 1998; Verkhov & Kozlova, 1998). Market competition \ncame to be advanced as crucial for the enhancement of service quality and client satisfaction. \n 33\nIn the absence of strong and long-established conventional forms of professional accreditation \nand organisation, the particular business history of an audit firm, its positioning in the market \nand client portfolio, came to play an important role in the production of status differentials \nand generation of public recognition and authority (Pyatenko, 1998; Verkhov & Kozlova, \n1998). \nDrawing on organisational patterns of the West, the government had introduced \nlicensing procedures for audit firms and professional examinations for individual auditors in \n1994 (see e.g. Bychkova, 1996; Enthoven et al., 1998; Sucher & Bychkova, 2001).31 Yet, \nwithin these structures, work and jurisdiction of the Russian auditing profession remained \nlargely undefined. The formal entry barriers to the profession remained low, and were not \nstrongly controlled (Danilevsky et al., 2002; Terekhov, 2001). In the view of many auditors, \nprofessional examinations represented a necessary condition for the carrying out of audit \nwork, but they did not constitute a very effective mechanism for the production of closure and \ncredentialising of expertise. This was confirmed by many interviewees occupying differing \npositions ranging from audit trainee, audit partner to firm director. The Deputy Director of \none of Russia\u2019s biggest audit firms remarked in this respect: \nThe qualification that is required to do audit work is relatively easy to get. The requirements are \nvery low. You just need to study for two nights; you read a little bit \u2013 that is all very easy. [\u2026] The \ncentres that conduct the exams are interested in letting as many students pass as possible, because \nthat\u2019s how they make money. They have to let the students pass to secure their existence. \nA senior expert involved in the management of audits at the same firm even decided \nnot to enrol for the national examinations: \nI decided not to get the certificate out of principle. I can openly say to you that our audit certificate \nis a complete profanation. The point is, well, usually all people who decide to take the exam will \nalso pass, and I don\u2019t believe in exams where 100 per cent pass. [\u2026] I just don\u2019t have any respect \nfor this exam; some people even just buy the certificate.32 \nDue to the lacking credibility of the state audit certificates, and supported by reform \nprogrammes aimed at marketisation and privatisation, ambitious audit firms began to promote \nthemselves as \u201csites of professionalisation\u201d (Cooper & Robson, 2006). Seeking to establish \nthemselves as \u201cpioneers\u201d and \u201celite\u201d (Pyatenko, 1997, 1998; Terekhov, 2001) of Russian \naudit development, they began to play a major role in the shaping of new professional \n                                                 \n31 See Regulation No. 482 on the issuing of audit certificates and audit licenses (Danilevsky, 1994). The \nregulation was adopted by the government on 6 May 1994. \n32 On the lacking quality of auditor certifications comment also Danilevsky et al. (2002) and Terekhov (2001). \n 34\nidentities and creation of intra-occupational status hierarchies. They began to run their own \ntraining programmes (see e.g. Unicon and FBK), adopted international auditing standards, \nrationalised audit procedures, formalised their audit methodologies and established \ndifferentiated command structures to establish clear divisions of audit labour (see e.g. \nDanilevsky et al., 2002; Pyatenko, 2001; Sheremet & Suyts, 2001 [1995]). In attempts to \ndemonstrate a \u201cmore civilised stage of [audit] development\u201d (Pyatenko, 2001, p. 119) ideals \nof professionalism came to be intertwined with displays of organisational efficiency and \neconomy (see also Guttseit & Ostrovsky, 1998; Sheremet & Suyts, 2001 [1995]). Pyatenko, \nfor example, wrote: \nFor auditors and consultants a deciding factor for their survival and development in the tough \nmarket environment consists in the professionalisation of the organisation of their business. [\u2026] \nThe fundament of a professional culture in an audit-consulting firm is the presence of well \nmastered management procedures at all levels [\u2026], and the ability to quickly and accurately utilise \nstandard working algorithms within day-to-day practices. (Pyatenko, 2001, pp. 7-9) \nThe establishment of standard operating procedures, the formalisation and \n\u201cindustrialisation\u201d (Pyatenko, 2001) of audit activities, came to be regarded as a sign of \n\u201cnormalisation\u201d and \u201ccivilised-ness\u201d (Guttseit, 2000; Guttseit & Ostrovsky, 1998; Pyatenko, \n1998, 2001; Terekhov, 2001). Once more, reference was made to the Big Six accounting \nfirms (see e.g. Danilevsky, 1990; Danilevsky, 1991; Pyatenko, 1997, 1998). Their \n\u201cbureaucratic professionalism\u201d [burokraticheskiy professionalizm] and rationalised ways of \norganising \u201cpaper-work\u201d [bumago-tvorchestvo] came to be seen as important attributes of \naudit professionalism (Pyatenko, 1998, pp. 14-18). Ideals of marketisation were reworked \nand, taking the then Big Six accounting firms as an example, auditing came to be linked up \nwith Weberian-like ideals of formal-rational organisation:33 \nWestern companies have great experience with methods of industrialisation and the very process \nof providing \u201cprofessional services\u201d. They have methods [\u2026] and standard operating procedures. \n[\u2026] The Big Six teach their people how to work on a conveyer belt. [\u2026] [Their methods of] \nstandardisation and industrialisation make it easier to train personnel and deal with turnover. This \nis their corporate culture. (Pyatenko, 1998, p. 15) \nOrganisational rigour and discipline came to be promoted as characteristics supporting \nthe establishment of \u201cnormally functioning market relations\u201d and the formation of \u201ca civilised \n                                                 \n33 To paraphrase Meyer and Rowan (1977, p. 340) the audit firms incorporated practices and procedures \n\u201cdefined by prevailing rationalized concepts of organizational work.\u201d They adopted these bureaucratic structures \nand rules not so much because of their immediate efficacy, but to enhance their \u201clegitimacy, resources and \nstability\u201d. Being both widely accepted amongst Western accounting firms and rooted in past ideals of Soviet \nbureaucratic organisation and planning, these rules, structures and procedures already enjoyed widespread \nlegitimacy and, thereby, could function as powerful symbols signalling orderliness, rationality and normality. \n 35\ncompetitive market\u201d (Pyatenko, 1998, 2001). Oddly enough, old ideals of efficient \nadministration, accuracy, and accounting hygiene, in this context, came to be provided with \nnew relevance. To some extent, in the name of the market, bureaucratic traditions were \nreinvented (see e.g. Avdyunin, 1996). Looking at how the big international accounting firms \norganised their work, well designed and articulated internal organisational structures, \nstandardised audit manuals, well managed archives with working papers and audit files, and \nformalised audit quality control procedures, came to be seen as characteristics distinguishing \nproper audit firms from foul players, often labelled as \u201cblack auditors\u201d [chornye auditory]. \nThe term \u201cblack auditors\u201d was widely used amongst regulators and professionals for \ndescribing auditors who were formally qualified but pursued audit activities in an unethical \nmanner, for example, by providing clean audit reports without backing these up with detailed \nchecks and documentations (Danilevsky et al., 2002; Guttseit, 2000). \nAgainst the background of widespread distrust in auditing (and accounting), and in \nview of the absence of credible professional certificates, \u201cbureaucratic professionalism\u201d was \nadvanced as important element in the achievement of audit quality, \u201ccivilized competition\u201d, \nmarket recognition and economic success (Guttseit & Ostrovsky, 1998; Pyatenko, 1998). The \nfixation of Western audit firms on procedural correctness, proper documentation, and formal \n\u201cauditability\u201d, as Power (1996, 1997) would put it (but see also Barrett, Cooper & Jamal, \n2005; Radcliffe, 1999; Van Maanen & Pentland, 1994), to some extent, could be invoked to \nre-legitimise old Soviet bookkeeping and inspection practices concentrating on issues of \nformal accuracy, lawfulness [zakonnost\u2019] and legal compliance work (see e.g. Bailey, 1995; \nCampbell, 1963; McGee & Preobragenskaya, 2005; Shama & McMahan, 1990). \nMost of the Russian audit firms that the author had visited in Moscow between 2001 \nand 2002 (8 out of 9) used audit manuals, documentation indices, working paper blueprints \nand quality control procedures that had been imported from the big international accounting \nfirms by employees who, at some point, had been working for these firms. These materials \nwere used to increase procedural orderliness, ensure accurate documentation and enhance \norganisational efficiency. Yet, these new technologies did not entirely replace old inspection \npractices. Audits conducted on Russian financial statements, largely continued to consist \nmainly of detailed, highly standardised transaction tests, aimed at checking documentary \n 36\naccuracy and compliance with national tax and accounting regulations. Less emphasis was \nplaced on checks of the control systems of an organisation, asset valuation and overall \neconomic representation. As the Deputy Director of one large Russian audit firm remarks: \nIn a Russian audit, you would find less confidence in the internal control systems. And therefore \nyou\u2019d have a much higher amount of substantive testing than in other countries. \nA senior auditor who worked for another large Russian audit firm commented: \nThe problem is not that auditors don\u2019t understand the operations [of the audited entity]. The \nproblem is that auditors have quite a formal approach to their work. Back in the Soviet times, there \nexisted the principle: if there is a document, there is also a transaction, and \u2013 vice versa \u2013 if there is \nno document, no entry into the books has to be made. Often, this principle is still alive today. \nA Russian partner of one of the large international audit firms confirmed this view: \nWhereas the task of the audit process is to throw light on the reliability [dostovernost\u2019] of the \nfinancial statements as a whole, the objective of an inspection [reviziya] is to check on concrete \nkinds of business activity, on concrete operations. [\u2026] Somehow\u2026 well, because the Russian \npublic is more used to inspections [reviziya], Russian audit companies often hang on to the \nideology of inspection [reviziya]. [\u2026] A certain part of the Russian community of auditors is \ninterested in inflating these differences under the label of Russian specificity. Many Russian \n[audit] firms use this in their competition with the Big Four. They say: \u201cWhat can they [the Big \nFour] give you? They control only in general, but we control every transaction.\u201d \nTo become redefined as market-oriented, actual accounting and audit practices did not \nnecessarily need to be radically changed. What changed, first of all, were the ways in which \nsuch practices were restaged, represented, marketed and commoditised. In attempts to make \npost-Soviet auditing marketable, audit and accounting technologies were not automatically \nradically reworked, but they came to be intertwined with Western marketing technologies, \nWestern ideas of strategic organisational management and the hierarchical structuring of large \ninternational professional services firms. In this process, ideas of auditing themselves came to \nbe redefined. Attention came to be shifted away from auditing as mechanism of certification \nenabling market exchange and accountability, to auditing as platform for entrepreneurial \ndevelopment, self-realisation and economic wealth creation. Auditing itself was reinvented as \na marketplace, with audit firms as central audit market designers. Despite the general public \nmistrust in accounting and audit reports, auditing could flourish, because of the marketing \nskills of a selective group of new audit entrepreneurs, the added consulting services they were \npromising to deliver, and the economic successfulness they emanated. Careful client \nmanagement, audit firm branding and instruments of efficient organisational management \ndirected attention away from the actual content of audits. Questions about auditing came to be \n 37\nreplaced with concerns about procedural rigour, corporate powerfulness and skilful \nimpression management. \nIn the following last part of the analysis, the paper turns to one particular instrument \nthat came to be of increasing importance for audit firms in attempts to create markets for their \nservices, enhance their standing and general credibility. Attention is drawn to the production \nand circulation of audit firm rankings. As will be shown, through the introduction and \ncirculation of audit firm rankings, in particular large Russian audit firms sought to reinforce \ntheir importance and central standing. Market ideals were translated into displays of inter-\norganisational competition, audit firm hierarchies, and organisational status differentiations. \nConnections came to be drawn between audit expertise and audit firm size; ideas on \nprofessional authority came to be intertwined with measures of corporate success. \nCompetition, rankings and status configurations \nOne of the first Russian audit firm rankings was published in February 1992 by the \nbusiness journal Kommersant (Danilevsky, 1992). The ranking was produced by the Russian \ntax authorities and consisted of a list of audit firms \u201cwhom they trust\u201d (Danilevsky, 1992, p. \n6). A couple of years later, audit-consulting firm rankings began to be produced by the \neditorial team of the Kommersant-Daily (No. 139, 27.07.1995; No. 56, 04.04.1996) and the \naudit firm FBK. FBK\u2019s rankings were (and still are) conducted on a voluntary basis. They \ncame to be of wide popularity and, from early on, were regularly published in leading Russian \nbusiness journals (e.g. the journal Ekspert). Drawing on Western audit firm rankings, in \nparticular those published by the International Accounting Bulletin (IAB)34, FBK ranked \nRussian audit firms by total earnings [vyruchka], fee income, service lines, and staff numbers. \nOther indicators published were earnings per employee (audit specialist), economic growth of \neach firm and the audit market as a whole, and comparative international audit firm rankings. \nFBK published its first ranking in 1996 in its in-house journal Finansovye i bukhgalterskie \nkonsul\u2019tatsii [Financial and bookkeeping advice] (No. 3, pp. 58-63).35 The ranking consisted \n                                                 \n34 The International Accounting Bulletin (IAB) is an international newsletter reporting \u201con the activities, \nperformance and strategies of the world\u2019s accounting firms.\u201d The IAB is subscribed by many large international \naccounting firms and banks, such as PwC, Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG, Barclays, and Credit Suisse. See \nwww.researchandmarkets.com\/reportinfo.asp?report_id=220224&t=d&cat_id (accessed September 2008). \n35 See also article \u201cThe largest firms on the Russian and world market for audit-consulting services\u201d \n(Finansovaya razeta, No. 33, 12.08.1996). \n 38\nof 20 Russian audit firms, which voluntarily participated. In 1997, the group of audit firms \nwanting to be ranked accrued to 41. By 1998, the ranking included already 100 firms \n(amongst them PricewaterhouseCoopers, see Table 2 below) and had come to be an \nestablished feature in the Russian business press (e.g. journals, such as Ekspert and Profil\u2019 or \nnewspapers, such as Finansovaya gazeta and Kommersant daily) (for an example of a more \nrecent ranking see Table 3 below).36 \nInsert Tables 2 and 3 about here \nDespite criticisms and articulations of mistrust (see e.g. Chaya, 2007; Danilevsky, \n1992; Finansovaya Gazeta, No. 23, 04.06.1996; Izvestiya, No. 103, 05.06.1996), over the \nyears the rankings gained more and more attention and influence.37 The audit firm rankings \nbegan to gain popularity at a time when ratings and rankings generally had acquired vogue in \nRussia\u2019s business world, not just in auditing and consulting, but also in other sectors of \nactivity. Rankings and ratings, at first, had been conducted on emerging Russian banks and \nnewly issued securities.38 Later the insurance and audit-consulting industries followed, and \nsoon after that universities and other organisational fields.39 In the insurance sector, rankings \nand ratings had been put forward as \u201csecond testimony\u201d [vtoroe svidetel\u2019stvo], as second \nassurance mechanism, particularly needed in the absence of trustworthy audits and \ngovernment structures (Finansovaya gazeta, No. 18, 1994). They were advanced as insurers \nof market principles, as promoters of \u201cconditions of open competition\u201d (ibid.). Also in the \nauditing field, audit firm rankings came to be regarded as a \u201cmeans of competition\u201d [sposob \nkonkurentnoy bor\u2019by] (Ekonomika i Zhizn, No. 29, 17.07.1997]. They were promoted as lists \n                                                 \n36 See e.g. issues No. 35 (16.09.1996), No. 12 (31.03.1997), No. 14 (14.04.1997) of the journal Ekspert, issue \nNo. 56 (04.04.1996) of the newspaper Kommersant-Daily, issues No. 33 (12.08.1996) and No. 16 (18.04.1997) \nof the newspaper Finansovaya gazeta, or issue No. 32 (08.09.1997) of the journal Profil\u2019. \n37 In an article of the Finansovaya gazeta (No. 23, 04.06.1996), the vice-president of the Russian Audit Chamber \n(Auditorskaya Palata Rossii) Sheremet, for example, criticised the methodology of the rankings and stated that \nsuch ratings misleadingly implied the foundation of a civilised market for audit services. Yet, such criticisms did \nnot stop their later rise and spread. \n38 See e.g. the securities rating published in the business journal Kommersant, No. 104, 27.01.1991, the article \n\u201cRating of the leaders in exchange market structures\u201d, Kommersant, No. 38, 23.9.1991, or the article \u201cHow to \nuse the rating of banks\u201d, Izvestiya-Ekspertiza, No. 52, 22.03.1995. \n39 On the importance of insurance firm ratings see the article by E. Kolomin, Finansovaya gazeta, No. 18, 1994. \nRegarding university rankings, see Kariera (No. 2, 01.05.1998). The reputation of the 100 largest Russian \ncorporations (financial and industrial sector) and Russian regions are rated in the journal Ekspert (see e.g. issues \nNo. 12, 31.03.1997 and No. 17, 12.05.1997). \n 39\nof the \u201clargest\u201d [krupnyshikh] and the \u201cleading\u201d [vedushiy], as a \u201cwho is who\u201d [kto est\u2019 kto] \nto aid auditor choice.40 \nPress articles with audit firm rankings carried titles, such as \u201cThe first ten audit firms \nin 1995\u201d [Pervaya desyatka auditorskikh firm po rezul\u2019tatam 1995 goda] (Kommersant-Daily, \nNo. 56, 04.04.1996); \u201cAuditors exist, auditing not, the market is developing\u201d [Auditory est\u2019, \naudita net, rynok razvivaetsya] (Kommersant-Daily, No. 56, 04.04.1996); \u201cIn Russia a \ncivilised market for auditing and consulting services is emerging\u201d [V Rossii poyavlyaetsya \ntsivilizovannyi rynok auditorskikh i konsul\u2019tativnykh uslug] (Finansovye Izvestiya, No. 64, \n20.06.1996); \u201cWho is who on the audit market\u201d [Kto est\u2019 kto na pynke auditorov] \n(Finansovye Izvestiya, No. 72, 23.07.1996); \u201cThe largest firms on the Russian and world \nmarket for audit-consulting services\u201d [Krupneyshie firmy na rossiyskom i mirovom rynke \nauditorsko-konsul\u2019tatsionnykh uslug] (Finansovaya gazeta, No. 33, 12.08.1996); \u201cMarket, \ncompetition, ranking\u201d [Rynok, konkurentsiya, reyting] (Ekonomika i Zhizn, No. 29, \n17.07.1997); \u201cAuditing the auditors\u201d [Audit auditorov] (Den\u2019gi, No. 42, 13.11.1997). \nLarge audit firms, like FBK, Unicon or Rosexpertiza sought to utilise the rankings to \ndemonstrate the \u201ccivilised nature\u201d of the audit market, show their competitive ability, and \nintroduce (at least rhetorically) quality differentials between large and small firms (see e.g. \nFinansovaya gazeta, No. 64, 20.06.1996; Ekspert, No. 35, 16.09.1996). The rankings should \ninform potential clients and the larger public about the \u201cleading figures\u201d in the Russian audit \nand consulting market (Kommersant-Daily, No. 56, 04.04.1996). They should demonstrate \ntheir influence and \u201cmelt down myths about the \u2018indispensability\u2019 of Western [audit] firms\u201d \n(Finansovaya gazeta, No. 64, 20.06.1996). In 1996, more than 3,000 audit firms operated in \nRussia (Kommersant-Daily, No. 56, 04.04.1996). By 2007, this number had increased to more \nthan 7,000 (see Table 1 above). Between 2004 and 2007, the total revenues of registered audit \nfirms had also doubled from 20.5 to 41.7 billion Roubles (see Table 4 below). During these \nyears, the 50 largest audit firms listed in the audit firm rankings, conducted by the rating \nagency Expert-RA, picked up about 80% of these revenues (see Table 5 below). \nInsert Tables 4 and 5 about here \n                                                 \n40 See e.g. audit firm rankings published in Den\u2019gi (No. 42, 13.11.1997), Ekspert (No. 35, 16.09.1996, No. 12, \n30.03.1998), Finansovye Izvestiya (No. 72, 23.07.1996). \n 40\nThe rankings came to be regarded as an important instrument that could help make a \nsmall subset of \u201cquality\u201d Russian audit firms more widely known, exhibit their prosperity and \nprofessionalism, and \u201coust non-professionals from the market\u201d [vytesnenie neprofessionalov c \nrynka] (ibid.). The rankings should prove that the firms were able to \u201cseriously compete\u201d with \nthe international audit firms \u2013 the then Big Six in particular (Kommersant-Daily, No. 216, \n17.12.1996). Attempts were made to establish a Russian alternative, a Russian \u201cBig Nine\u201d (or \nBig Ten), to the Western \u201cBig Six\u201d (Finansovaya Izvestiya, No. 72, 23.07.1996), and \ncontribute to the formation of an \u201caudit elite\u201d (Ekspert, No. 35, 20.09.1999). \nThe rankings were not representative of the whole audit market. Participation in them \nwas (and still is) voluntary. Only the largest 100-150 firms of those applying for inclusion in \nthe ranking came to be listed. In this respect, the rankings were of a very specific form, in \nwhich differentiation within the rankings mattered less than the difference between who came \nto be included and who was not. Firms who managed to be included gained more visibility, \nand audit firm leadership came to be equated with a firm\u2019s inclusion in the rankings. The \nrankings were controversially discussed, and did not only receive affirmative attention. Yet, \nin particular for the larger firms, the rankings came to constitute an important vehicle of \nrepresentation and market differentiation. They corroborated their leading role and \nsignificance by shifting attention away from questions of audit quality to measures of \ncorporate successfulness. Audit firm size came to be put forward as a surrogate for audit \nquality, driving professional distinction and status differentiation.41 \nAs Espeland and Sauder (2007; Sauder & Espeland, 2009) have pointed out for \nrankings more generally, rankings shape what we pay attention to. They create and obscure \nrelations among entities, and they change the form and locus of attention. Also in the context \nof this study, audit firm rankings contributed to a \u201csimplification and de-contextualisation\u201d \n(Espeland & Saunder, 2007) of knowledge. The audit firm rankings could be circulated \nwidely in popular Russian business journals, such as Ekspert or Profil\u2019. No specialist \nknowledge appeared to be needed for their interpretation. In the rankings, audit successfulness \ncame to be redefined in terms of market successfulness, and questions seeking to address \n                                                 \n41 It is interesting to note that audit firm size is also commonly used as a proxy for quality in audit research (see \ne.g. DeAngelo, 1981; Palmrose, 1988). \n 41\nissues of audit quality came to be displaced. Audit firm size was put forward as a surrogate \nfor audit quality, driving professional distinction and status differentiation. As national \nlicensing and audit certification mechanisms did not have much credentialising and \ndifferentiating power, rankings focusing on audit firm size came to be regarded as one \npossible alternative mechanism of distinction and status differentiation. Albeit not \nuncritically, Guttseit and Ostrovsky, who at government level were involved in matters of \naudit and accounting reform and research, for example wrote: \nAudit firm rankings will, as a rule, pick out and rank only the best ones [\u2026]. The striving of audit \nfirms for a high place in solid rankings can strongly support the enhancement of the quality of \naudit services. (Guttseit & Ostrovsky, 1998, p. 87) \nWhether or not the rankings actually corresponded with different levels of audit \nquality did not matter much. In any case, large firms were provided with an important \nplatform for their marketing and brand creation. The rankings could be used as rhetorical \nvehicle to gain public visibility, and advance firm size and corporate powerfulness as \nindicators of audit quality and professional leadership. With the help of the rankings, at least \nrhetorically, boundaries could be erected between different groups of audit market \nparticipants. Boundaries could be erected between those who were included and those who \nwere excluded from the ranking, between small and large audit firms. Following the rankings, \nalso textbooks and other media began to divide and classify audit market participants by size. \nFour groups of audit firms came to be identified: the then Big Six (now Big Four); second-tier \ninternational audit networks; large and medium-sized Russian audit firms; and small firms \nand partnerships (Danilevsky et al., 2002; Pyatenko, 1997, 1998; Terekhov, 2001). Taking the \nbig accounting firms as a benchmark, generally larger firms came to be portrayed as the firms \nof higher quality, with better trained personnel, more resources, more efficient structures and \nrigour. Later in 2001, when the new Federal Audit Law was adopted, very small partnerships \nwere no longer allowed. Licenses were only given to audit organisations consisting of five or \nmore certified audit professionals (Danilevsky et al., 2002). All this contributed to a further \ncorporatisation of the emerging Russian audit profession. Professional prestige accrued not to \nindividual accountants\/auditors or professional associations, but to particular prestigious firms \nportraying themselves as enforcing high standards. \n 42\nAudit firm branding and marketing became decisive for the erection of intra-\noccupational boundaries, status group formations and internal differentiation. In contrast, \ntraditional mechanisms of professional organisation and closure, such as state licensing, state-\naccredited professional examinations and professional associations, did not have much \ndifferentiating and organising power. Such structures were developed, but they did not \ncontribute much to the enhancement of professional status, prestige and credibility. Instead, \nnotions of professionalism came to be intertwined with activities of organisational marketing, \ndemonstrations of corporate influence and the establishment of administrative efficiency. This \nfinding is consistent with Cooper and Robson\u2019s (2006) reminder that professional firms, \nparticularly large international firms, are increasingly important in accounting \nprofessionalisation and regulatory processes (see also Anderson-Gough, Grey & Robson, \n1998; Caramanis, 1999, 2002; Cooper et al., 1998; Dezalay & Sugarman, 1995; Empson, \n2004; Greenwood & Suddaby, 2006; Greenwood et al., 2006; Hanlon, 1998; Hinings et al., \n1999; Ramirez, 2009; Robson et al., 1994; Suddaby et al., 2007). In the case studied, audit \nfirm rankings and other marketing devices reinforced the central standing of audit firms. \nThrough the rankings and other branding activities, audit firms (and not professional \nassociations) were promoted as the main entities involved in the organisation and \ntransformation of audit expertise. Attention was thus directed away from the individual \nprofessional to the audit organisation. Projects aimed at increasing professional status and \nexternal recognition came to be carried forward at the level of audit firms and their \npositioning in the emerging audit market. \nIn so doing, the relationship between auditing, audit professionalism and markets \ncame to be reworked. The new audit entrepreneurs did not want \u201cto escape from market \nevaluations\u201d (Burrage, 2006), but sought to actively embrace and shape them (e.g. through the \naudit firm rankings). In contrast to the 18th century lawyers in England and France that \nBurrage (2006) studied, the Russian auditors did not seek to construct \u201cprivate enclaves\u201d in \nwhich market rules could be \u201cmodified or suspended and declined\u201d (Burrage, 2006, p. 20). \n\u201cThe market\u201d was not perceived as a threat to professionalism, but as a platform allowing for \nprofessional development and the enhancement of public recognition. Looking at the West \nand large multinational accounting firms, \u201cthe market\u201d was appealed to as a mechanism for \n 43\nthe promotion of audit development. \u201cThe market\u201d came to be seen as a space in which audit \nquality differentials and mechanisms of professional distinction could be worked out and \ndemonstrated. On the other hand, one could argue that a market as such \u2013 a market as \nenvisaged in textbooks \u2013 never came to be realised. Neither audit firms, nor their marketing \ninstruments (e.g. audit firm rankings) came to function as neutral, objective information \nintermediaries. Auditing was turned into a market-oriented activity, but status and reputation \nof the audit firms did not come to be determined by an abstract market mechanism. They were \nactively created, crafted and shaped, by the audit firms themselves and their representational \ninstruments. \nDiscussion and Conclusion \nThis paper has examined the roles that images and ideas of market creation played in \nthe re-articulation of relations between government, audit expertise and professional \norganisation in post-Soviet Russia. A \u2018linked ecologies\u2019 approach, together with concepts \ndrawn from the governmentality literature and social studies of science and technology, has \nbeen used to trace how audit and market ideals mutually shape and condition one another. It is \nsuggested that the notion of linked ecologies helps in developing a more nuanced and \ndynamic account of the multiple relations that came to be formed between audit, and ideas \nand instruments of post-Soviet market creation. This allows us to examine not only the roles \nof governmental reform programmes in transforming \u201cthe ethos of government\u201d (Rose, 1999) \nfrom one of bureaucracy to one of business. It also allows us to investigate how such \nprogrammes came to be reworked through new entrepreneurial selves and their newly \nfounded audit firms, which had emerged as a result of the reform programmes. \nIn post-Soviet Russia, many factors contributed to the rise and spread of audit \nexpertise that went beyond the immediate control demands from shareholders, investors and \nother financial market participants. Auditing emerged at a time when shareholders and \nfinancial markets did not yet exist, and it was appealed to as a mechanism to bring such \nmarkets into being. On the other hand, auditing itself came to be redefined as a site of market \ncreation. Audit expertise itself was marketised, and ideas and images of audit and market \ncreation came to co-constitute and redefine each other. Looking at audit and markets as linked \n 44\necologies, this paper paid attention on the one hand to the different relationships and the \ndynamics evolving between abstract globalised ideas and models of audit and market \ndevelopment, and, on the other hand, the more specific and localised programmes and \ntechnologies of audit and audit market creation. In the case studied, new Russian audit \nentrepreneurs and their firms came to be actively engaged in making audit marketable. They \nactively sought to create an audience for auditing and, in this process, the meaning of markets \nand the roles of auditing in them came to be redefined. \nAuditing came to be shifted away from Western textbook ideals, which had depicted it \nlargely as a mechanism to reduce information asymmetry and enhance market accountability. \nInstead, auditing came to be viewed as a platform for corporate development and \nentrepreneurial self-realisation. Auditors sought to reinvent themselves as business \nconsultants, and construed themselves as \u201cbusiness doctors who heal\u201d. Audit success was \nredefined in terms of corporate success, and projects aimed at increasing professional status \nand external recognition were carried forward at the level of audit firms and their positioning \nin the emerging audit market. Notions of good or bad, professional or unprofessional auditing \ncame to be linked to audit firm size and corporate influence. In the market-oriented \ncorporatisation of audit activities, the then Big Six accounting firms played a major role as \nrole models. Their international standing and local presence reinforced beliefs that the \nfoundation of commercial, market-oriented audit firms constituted the right response to \ninspection reform demands. The big firms came to be seen as entities that had successfully \nembraced market ideals, and that exhibited high standards of professionalism. They had a \n\u201ctrade mark\u201d that particularly larger Russian audit firms aspired to (Pyatenko, 2001, p. 36). \nThe big firms were further important in the spreading and local transfer of Western marketing \nand branding instruments. \nLocal Russian audit firms adopted these instruments, along with audit firm rankings \nsimilar to those published in the International Accounting Bulletin, to enhance their reputation \nand local standing. Yet, as this paper has showed, the audit firm rankings, together with other \nmarketing instruments, helped shift attention away from auditing itself, and toward \nmechanisms of its representation and marketability. Activities and instruments aimed at \nmaking auditing widely \u201cpresentable\u201d and \u201ccommunicable\u201d came to the fore, eclipsing from \n 45\npublic scrutiny questions concerning the characteristics of audit methodology, the audit \nknowledge base, and isues concerning professional qualification. Put differently, audit firm \nrankings and other marketing instruments contributed to \u201cdeflecting attention\u201d (Espeland & \nSaunder, 2007) away from audit content and related questions of accountability, governance \nand audit quality control. In the process, market ideals were redefined too. Ideals close to \nclassic and neoclassic notions, which viewed the market as an abstract mechanism for the \ncoordination of economic exchange, were reworked. Markets came to be envisaged as \nconsisting of competing powerful corporate entities, and as a space in need of being actively \nordered and organised. \nWhat do these developments imply with respect to the broader roles of audit in the \nconstruction of markets? The paper showed how new Russian audit entrepreneurs, together \nwith their audit firms, actively created the markets they sought to rule. They perceived the \nrole of an auditor as that of \u201ca creator, a strategist, a founder and developer of new markets \nand the methods of their mastering\u201d (Pyatenko, 1998, p. 39). In the case studied, auditing did \nnot fulfil the function of spurring capital market development. Between 1991 and 1999, \nRussian capital markets remained relatively underdeveloped (OECD, 2005; World Bank \nOffice Moscow, 2004), and audits for local IPOs and internationally listed Russian companies \nwere mainly conducted by the big international accounting firms. Yet, Russian audit firms \ncontributed to the construction of markets in other ways. \nFrom early on, Russian audit firms sought to offer both control and consulting \nservices. In adopting and spreading Western technologies of marketing, strategic \nmanagement, enterprise resource planning and IT management, they provided new Russian \nenterprises with valuable business advice. They helped them set up market-oriented business \ninfrastructures. They introduced notions of client management, highlighted the relevance of \nPR, and provided consulting services in the areas of procurement and supply chain \nmanagement (see e.g. Pyatenko, 1998, 2001). Further, they helped their clients to get the \naccounting books in order, deal with tax inspectorates and adapt to the rapidly changing legal \nenvironment. The audit firms contributed to the reduction of legal risk, and protected clients \nfrom the taxation authorities. Finally, the audit firms themselves came to be seen as successful \nmarket actors and functioned as role models for other firms, for example, with respect to their \n 46\nexpertise in reputation management, client management and personnel training (Danilevsky, \n1995a, b; Pyatenko, 1998, 2001). \nIt would be useful to carry out further investigations into how auditing interacts with \ndifferent forms of market-oriented business management. More generally, it would be useful \nto gain deeper insight into the dynamics of client-auditor relationships, and to analyse how \nthese contribute to shifts in strategies of market building and audit practice. This study \nshowed how the market relevance of auditing is something that needs to be actively built. Yet, \nformer Soviet calculative practices and inspection technologies were not entirely changed or \nreplaced, and we need to be careful not to overstate the transformative power of auditing. \nWhat auditing and \u201cgoverning through markets\u201d means is something that needs to be worked \nout, over and over again. In this process, the meaning of auditing and markets is neither clear-\ncut, nor can it be presumed. In utilising a linked ecologies approach, this paper sought to \nmake more room for the complexities and paradoxes that derive from attempts to spread and \nutilise somewhat ambiguous and ill-defined Western concepts of market-oriented auditing. \nIn the case studied, the rise and spread of auditing was not automatically accompanied \nby an intensification of processes of neoliberalisation, enhanced levels of market \naccountability and organisational or individual scrutiny. Nor did it lead to the spread and \nuniform application of a set of new and distinct audit technologies. At least to some extent, \nauditing was built onto the very same bookkeeping and inspection practices that it was asked \nto reform. Distinctions between socialist inspection and market-oriented auditing therefore \nwere not so much worked out on the grounds of changes in accounting frameworks, economic \ncalculation and checking styles. Similar to the former state inspections, auditing \u2013 or at least \nthe core activity of auditing, the checking of financial statements \u2013 continued to be regarded \nby many as a somewhat ritualistic compliance exercise. Yet, because of the audit firms\u2019 \ncorporate success, their marketing activities, their careful client management, and their \nattempts to expand notions of auditing to include consulting and other advisory services, the \naudit industry could sustain itself and further expand. Auditing became a label for a mix of \ndifferent activities ranging from transaction checking to strategic consulting. This does not \nmean that old inspection practices no longer had a place. Rather, new services (e.g. valuation \nservices, IFRS reconciliations) and audit methodologies (e.g. Western audit risk models and \n 47\nsampling techniques) were added on. In the long run, these new services and technologies \nmay change the way in which audits are carried out. This change, however, is likely to be \nmuch more incremental than the process of audit commercialisation and privatisation that this \npaper has studied. \nTo conclude, audit is not something that represents an unproblematic, stable logic. Nor \nis it linked necessarily to readily defined rationalities of neoliberalism or audit \nprofessionalism. Linkages between audit and markets, and between politics and expertise, are \nopen to conflict, contradiction and instability. Auditing, similar to the neoliberal project of \nmarketisation itself, can embrace a multiplicity of different voices, views and practices (see \nalso the study by Kipnis, 2008). From this, it follows that we need to be careful not to see \naudit as a fixed instrument and an uncontroversial expression of neoliberal modes of \ngoverning. Effects of auditing, and how these feed back, cannot be deduced from the \nprogrammes \u2013 for example programmes of professionalisation or market-oriented \ntransformation \u2013 that accompany its rise and expansion. Equally important are local concerns \nand practices, that pick such programmes up, transform and rework them, and thereby \ncontribute not only to the further spread of auditing and markets, but also to their own \nreformulation and transformation.\n \nReferences \nAbbott, A.
