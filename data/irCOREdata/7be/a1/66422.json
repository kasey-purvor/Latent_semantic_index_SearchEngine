The experimental programme of the dedicated B-factories BaBar and Belle will con-\ntribute to unravel structure and size of flavour- and CP-violation. The key-observable\nis the unitarity-triangle of the CKM-matrix whose overdetermination will help to answer\nthe question whether there are additional sources of CP-violation not present in the SM.\nOverdetermination means independent measurements of sides and angles from different\nprocesses. One of the sides is determined by the CKM-matrix element |Vub|, whose pre-\ncise measurement is certainly a challenging task due to the smallness of the corresponding\nbranching ratios. The method of choice is to measure it from semileptonic tree-level decays\nb \u2192 ue\u03bd where contamination by new-physics effects is expected to be small. The main\ncomplication in this measurement is, as a matter of course, QCD effects whose calcula-\ntion from first principles is highly challenging. Inclusive semileptonic decays are usually\ntreated in heavy quark expansion and become the more delicate the more accurately ex-\nperimentally necessary cuts are taken into account (which necessitates the inclusion of\nother potentially large scales and calls for threshold- and soft-gluon resummation, cf. [1]).\nThe alternative is to study exclusive decays where, owing to the nonrenormalization of\nvector and axialvector currents, both perturbative and nonperturbative QCD effects are\nneatly encoded in form-factors, depending on only one variable, the momentum-transfer\nto the leptons. The simplest such decay-process, involving only a single form-factor1, is\nB \u2192 \u03c0\u2113\u03bd\u2113, which hence has received fair attention in the literature. First experimental\nresults are available from CLEO [2]. The most precise calculation of the form-factor will\nsans doute finally come from lattice-simulations; presently, however, the main attention\nof lattice-practitioners appears to be directed not so much to obtaining phenomenologi-\ncally relevant results, but rather to controlling lattice artifacts and approximations like\ndiscretization errors and the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry with Wilson-fermions,\nparticularly relevant for calculating processes that involve pions; another problem is how\nto simulate relativistic b-quarks, and how to access the region of phase-space where the\npion has large momentum. All these problems are presently under intense debate, and we\nrefer to Ref. [3] for reviews and recent research papers.\nAnother, technically much simpler, but also less rigorous approach is provided by QCD\nsum rules on the light-cone (LCSRs) [4, 5]. The key-idea is to consider a correlation-\nfunction of the weak current and a current with the quantum-numbers of the B-meson,\nsandwiched between the vacuum and a pion. For large (negative) virtualities of these\ncurrents, the correlation-function is, in coordinate-space, dominated by distances close to\nthe light-cone and can be discussed in the framework of light-cone expansion. In contrast\nto the short-distance expansion employed by conventional QCD sum rules a` la SVZ [6],\nwhere nonperturbative effects are encoded in vacuum expectation values of local operators\nwith vacuum quantum numbers, the condensates, LCSRs rely on the factorization of the\nunderlying correlation function into genuinely nonperturbative and universal hadron dis-\ntribution amplitudes (DAs) \u03c6 that are convoluted with process-dependent amplitudes TH ,\nwhich are the analogues to the Wilson-coefficients in the short-distance expansion and can\n1This statement is true only as long as lepton-masses are negligible, i.e. for semi-electronic and -muonic\ndecays.\n1\nbe calculated in perturbation theory, schematically\ncorrelation function \u223c\n\u2211\nn\nT\n(n)\nH \u2297 \u03c6\n(n). (1)\nThe sum runs over contributions with increasing twist, labelled by n, which are suppressed\nby increasing powers of, roughly speaking, the virtualities of the involved currents. The\nsame correlation function can, on the other hand, be written as a dispersion-relation, in\nthe virtuality of the current coupling to the B-meson. Equating dispersion-representation\nand the light-cone expansion, and separating the B-meson contribution from that of higher\none- and multi-particle states, one obtains a relation for the form-factor describing B \u2192 \u03c0.\nThe particular strength of LCSRs lies in the fact that they allow inclusion not only\nof hard-gluon exchange contributions, which have been identified, in the seminal papers\nthat opened the study of hard exclusive processes in the framework of perturbative QCD\n(pQCD) [7], as being dominant in light-meson form factors, but that they also capture\nthe so-called Feynman-mechanism, where the quark created at the weak vertex carries\nnearly all momentum of the meson in the final-state, while all other quarks are soft. This\nmechanism is suppressed by two powers of momentum-transfer in processes with light\nmesons; as shown in [5], this suppression is absent in heavy-to-light transitions2 and hence\nany reasonable application of pQCD to B-meson decays should include this mechanism.\nLCSRs also avoid any reference to a \u201clight-cone wave-function of the B-meson\u201d, which\nis a necessary ingredient in all extensions of the original pQCD method to heavy-meson\ndecays [8, 9], but whose exact definition appears to be problematic [10]. A more detailed\ndiscussion of the rationale of LCSRs and of the more technical aspects of the method is\nbeyond the scope of this letter; more information can be found in the literature [11].\nLCSRs are available for the B \u2192 \u03c0 form factor f+ to O(\u03b1s) accuracy for the leading\ntwist-2 contribution and at tree-level for higher-twist (3 and 4) contributions [12, 13, 14]. In\nthis letter we calculate the leading radiative corrections to the twist-3 contributions. The\nmotivation for this calculation is twofold: first, it has been found in [12, 13, 14] that the\ntree-level twist-3 corrections are chirally enhanced and sizeable, and amount up to 30% of\nthe final result for f+, which indicates that radiative corrections may be phenomenologically\nrelevant. Second, the existence of the factorization-formula (1) is nontrivial beyond tree-\nlevel and, to date, it is only for the twist-2 contribution that factorization has been shown\nto hold also after inclusion of radiative corrections. In this letter we show that (1), for\na certain approximation of the DAs \u03c6(3) (leading conformal spin), also holds when O(\u03b1s)\ncorrections to the twist-3 contributions are included.\n2. Let us now properly define the relevant quantities. The form-factors f+,0 are given by\n(q = pB \u2212 p)\n\u3008\u03c0(p)|u\u00af\u03b3\u00b5b|B(pB)\u3009 = f+(q\n2)\n{\n(pB + p)\u00b5 \u2212\nm2B \u2212m\n2\n\u03c0\nq2\nq\u00b5\n}\n+\nm2B \u2212m\n2\n\u03c0\nq2\nf0(q\n2) q\u00b5; (2)\nin semileptonic decays the physical range in q2 is 0 \u2264 q2 \u2264 (mB\u2212m\u03c0)\n2. The starting point\n2For very large quark masses, though, the Feynman-mechanism is suppressed by Sudakov-logarithms,\nwhich are, however, not expected to be effective at the b-quark mass.\n2\nfor the calculation of the form-factor f+ in (2) is the correlation function\ni\n\u222b\nd4yeiqy\u3008\u03c0(p)|T [u\u00af\u03b3\u00b5b](y)[mbb\u00afi\u03b35d](0)|0\u3009 = \u03a0+2p\u00b5 + . . . , (3)\nwhere the dots stand for structures not relevant for the calculation of f+. As mentioned\nbefore, for a certain configuration of virtualities, namely m2b \u2212 p\n2\nB \u2265 O(\u039bQCDmb) and\nm2b \u2212 q\n2 \u2265 O(\u039bQCDmb), the integral is dominated by light-like distances and accessible to\nan expansion around the light-cone:\n\u03a0+(q\n2, p2B) =\n\u2211\nn\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu \u03c6(n)(u;\u00b5IR)T\n(n)\nH (u; q\n2, p2B;\u00b5IR). (4)\nAs in (1), n labels the twist of operators and \u00b5IR is the (infrared) factorization-scale. The\nrestriction on q2, m2b\u2212q\n2 \u2265 O(\u039bQCDmb), implies that f+ is not accessible at all momentum-\ntransfers; to be be specific, we restrict ourselves to 0 \u2264 q2 \u2264 14GeV2. As \u03a0+ is independent\nof \u00b5IR, the above formula implies that the scale-dependence of T\n(n)\nH must be canceled by\nthat of the DAs \u03c6(n).\nIn (4) we have assumed that \u03a0+ can be described by collinear factorization, i.e. that\nthe only relevant degrees of freedom are the longitudinal momentum fractions u carried by\nthe partons in the \u03c0, and that transverse momenta can be integrated over. Hard infrared\n(collinear) divergencies occurring in T\n(n)\nH should be absorbable into the DAs, as discussed\nin detail in Ref. [15]. Collinear factorization is trivial at tree-level, where the b-quark mass\nacts effectively as regulator, but can, in principle, be violated by radiative corrections, by\nso-called \u201csoft\u201d divergent terms, which yield divergencies upon integration over u. Such\nterms break for instance factorization in non-leading twist in the treatment of nonleptonic\nB-decays a` la BBNS [9]; it is thus instructive to see what happens in the simpler case of the\ncorrelation function (3), where the convolution involves only one DA instead of up to three\nin B \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0. To anticipate the result: we find that factorization also works at one-loop\nlevel for twist-3 contributions and that there are no soft divergencies.\nThere are two two-quark twist-3 DAs of the \u03c0, \u03c6p and \u03c6\u03c3, which are defined as\n\u30080|u\u00af(x)[x,\u2212x]i\u03b35d(\u2212x)|\u03c0\n\u2212(p)\u3009 = \u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5IR)\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu ei\u03bepx \u03c6p(u, \u00b5IR), (5)\n\u30080|u\u00af(x)[x,\u2212x]\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\u03b35d(\u2212x)|\u03c0\n\u2212(p)\u3009 = \u2212\ni\n3\n\u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5IR)(p\u03b1x\u03b2 \u2212 p\u03b2x\u03b1)\n\u222b 1\n0\ndu ei\u03bepx \u03c6\u03c3(u, \u00b5IR) (6)\nwith \u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5IR) = f\u03c0m\n2\n\u03c0\/(mu +md)(\u00b5IR) and \u03be = 2u \u2212 1; u is the longitudinal momentum-\nfraction of the total momentum of the \u03c0 carried by the (d-)quark. The Wilson-line\n[x,\u2212x] = P exp[2ig\n\u222b 1\n0\ndtx\u00b5A\n\u00b5((2t\u2212 1)x)]\nensures gauge-invariance of the nonlocal matrix-elements. Exploiting conformal symmetry\nof massless QCD, which holds to leading-logarithmic accuracy, one can perform a partial-\nwave expansion of the DAs in terms of increasing conformal spin, which amounts to an\nexpansion in Gegenbauer-polynomials and fixes the functional dependence on u; the am-\nplitudes of the partial-waves are of nonperturbative origin and can be related to local\n3\nFigure 1: Some of the diagrams contributing to T\n(p,\u03c3)\nH in one-loop order. The double line\ndenotes the b-quark propagator, the single lines denote the light u- and d-quark propaga-\ntors. \u03b3\u00b5 and \u03b35 are the weak and the B-vertex, respectively. There are two more self-energy\nand one more vertex-correction diagrams.\nhadronic matrix-elements by virtue of the QCD equations of motion as discussed in detail\nin [16, 17]. It turns out, in particular, that the two DAs \u03c6\u03c3 and \u03c6p are not indepen-\ndent, but mix with each other and the twist-3 three-particle DA T that parametrizes the\nmatrix-element \u30080|u\u00af(x)[x, vx]\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd\u03b35gG\u03b1\u03b2(vx)[vx,\u2212x]d(\u2212x)|\u03c0\n\u2212(p)\u3009. Thus, for consistency,\nwhen calculating radiative corrections to \u03a0+ to twist-3 accuracy, one has to include all\nthree DAs,\n\u03a0\n(3)\n+ \u223c \u03c6p \u2297 T\n(p)\nH + \u03c6\u03c3 \u2297 T\n(\u03c3)\nH + T \u2297 T\n(T )\nH ,\nand it is only in the sum of these three terms that hard infrared divergencies and the\nscale-dependence are expected to cancel. The analysis of [16] has shown, however, that the\ntwo-quark DAs are very well approximated by the lowest partial-wave, i.e. the one with\nsmallest conformal spin, and that mixing with T sets in only at higher conformal spin.\nIn calculating radiative corrections to \u03a0\n(3)\n+ we thus restrict ourselves to leading conformal\nspin, i.e. the so-called asymptotic DAs, and use [16]\n\u03c6\u03c3(u) = 6u(1\u2212 u), \u03c6p(u) = 1, T = 0. (7)\n3. Some of the diagrams contributing to T (p,\u03c3)H to one-loop order are shown in Fig. 1. The\nlight quarks are massless and have momenta up and u\u00afp \u2261 (1 \u2212 u)p, respectively. They\nare projected onto the desired DA by closing the trace with an appropriate projection\noperator P, which is just \u2212\u00b52\u03c0i\u03b35\/4 for \u03c6p and involves a derivative in p for \u03c6\u03c3. The\ncalculation is performed in dimensional regularization for both ultraviolet and infrared\ndivergencies. Carefully distinguishing between the two types of divergent terms, we find\nthat the ultraviolet divergencies cancel upon renormalization of the bare b-quark mass in\nthe tree-level expression, as they should. The infrared divergent terms, on the other hand,\ndo not cancel between \u00b52,bare\u03c0 \u03c6p(\u03c3) and T\n(p(\u03c3),bare)\nH separately, but only in the sum of both\ncontributions. The renormalized T\n(p,\u03c3)\nH (u) are regular at the endpoints, i.e. for u \u2192 0,\nu\u2192 1, which entails the absence of soft divergent terms.\nAs discussed below, the LCSR for f+ involves the continuum-subtracted Borel-transform\nB\u02c6subTH of TH . We calculate it by splitting TH into two terms, TH = T\npole\nH + T\ndis\nH , where\nT disH can be written as a dispersion-relation in p\n2\nB and its Borel-transform is obtained by\n4\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n-0.075\n-0.05\n-0.025\n0\n0.025\n0.05\n0.075\n0.1\nq2\nFigure 2: Radiative corrections to twist-2 and 3 contributions, in units of \u03b1s\/(3\u03c0), for\nrepresentative input-parameters, as functions of q2.

Whereas the absolute\nvalue of the two twist-3 corrections is, separately, of roughly the same size as that of the\ntwist-2 correction, the only relevant quantity, the sum of both twist-3 corrections, is much\nsmaller than the twist-2 contribution, which indicates a good convergence of the light-cone\nexpansion also at O(\u03b1s).\nThe result of this calculation is the light-cone expansion of \u03a0+, \u03a0\nLC\n+ , and its continuum-\nsubtracted Borel-transform, B\u02c6sub\u03a0\nLC\n+ .\n4. Let us now derive the LCSR for f+. The correlation function \u03a0+, calculated for\nunphysical p2B, can be written as dispersion-relation over its physical cut. Singling out the\ncontribution of the B-meson, one has\n\u03a0+ = f+(q\n2)\nm2BfB\nm2B \u2212 p\n2\nB\n+ higher poles and cuts, (8)\nwhere fB is the leptonic decay constant of the B-meson, fBm\n2\nB = mb\u3008B|b\u00afi\u03b35d|0\u3009. In the\nframework of LCSRs one does not use (8) as it stands, but performs a Borel-transformation,\nB\u02c6\n1\nt\u2212 p2B\n=\n1\nM2\nexp(\u2212t\/M2), (9)\nwith the Borel-parameter M2; this transformation enhances the ground-state B-meson\ncontribution to the dispersion-representation of \u03a0+ and suppresses contributions of higher\ntwist to the light-cone expansion of \u03a0+. The next step is to invoke quark-hadron duality\nto approximate the contributions of hadrons other than the ground-state B-meson by the\n5\nimaginary part of the light-cone expansion of \u03a0+, so that\nB\u02c6\u03a0LC+ =\n1\nM2\nm2BfB f+(q\n2) e\u2212m\n2\nB\n\/M2 +\n1\nM2\n1\n\u03c0\n\u222b \u221e\ns0\ndt Im\u03a0LC+ (t) exp(\u2212t\/M\n2) (10)\nand B\u02c6sub\u03a0\nLC\n+ =\n1\nM2\nm2BfB f+(q\n2) e\u2212m\n2\nB\n\/M2 . (11)\nEq. (11) is the LCSR for f+. s0 is the so-called continuum threshold, which separates the\nground-state from the continuum contribution. At tree-level, the continuum-subtraction\nin (11) introduces a lower limit of integration, u \u2265 (m2b \u2212 q\n2)\/(s0 \u2212 q\n2) \u2261 u0, in (4), which\nbehaves as 1\u2212\u039bQCD\/mb for large mb and thus corresponds to the dynamical configuration\nof the Feynman-mechanism, as it cuts off low momenta of the u-quark created at the weak\nvertex. At O(\u03b1s), there are also contributions with no cut in the integration over u, which\nthus correspond to hard-gluon exchange contributions. Numerically, these terms turn out\nto be very small, \u223c O(1%) of the total result for f+. As with standard QCD sum rules, the\nuse of quark-hadron duality above s0 and the choice of s0 itself introduce a certain model-\ndependence (or systematic error) in the final result for the form-factor, which is difficult to\nestimate. In this letter we opt for being rather conservative and add a 20% systematic error\nto the final result for f+. Another hadronic parameter showing up in (11), which actually\nallows one to fix the value of s0, is fB. fB can in principle be measured from the decay B \u2192\n\u2113\u03bd\u00af\u2113, which, due to the expected smallness of its branching ratio, BR\u223c O(10\n\u22126), has, up to\nnow, escaped experimental detection. fB is one of the best-studied observables in lattice-\nsimulations with heavy quarks; the current world-average from unquenched calculations\nwith two dynamical quarks is fB = (200 \u00b1 30)MeV [18]. It can also be calculated from\nQCD sum rules: the most recent determinations [19] include O(\u03b12s) corrections and find\n(206 \u00b1 20)MeV and (197 \u00b1 23)MeV, respectively. For consistency, we do not use these\nresults, but replace fB in (11) by its QCD sum rule toO(\u03b1s) accuracy, including dependence\non s0 and M\n2. For the b-quark mass, we use an average over recent determinations of the\nMS mass, mb,MS(mb) = (4.22 \u00b1 0.08)GeV [20, 21], which corresponds to the one-loop\npole-mass mb,1L\u2212pole = (4.60 \u00b1 0.09)GeV; this is different from the value mb = 4.8GeV\nwe used in our previous paper, the first reference in [13]. With these values we find\nfB = (192 \u00b1 22)GeV (the error only includes variation with mb and M\n2, at optimized\ns0), in very good agreement with both lattice and QCD sum rules to O(\u03b1\n2\ns) accuracy. For\nmb = (4.51, 4.60, 4.69)GeV the optimized s0 are (34.5, 34.0, 33.5)GeV\n2, and the relevant\nrange in M2 is M2 \u2248(4.5\u20138) GeV2.\nThe infrared factorization-scale is set to \u00b52IR = m\n2\nB \u2212 m\n2\nb [22]; the dependence of f+\non \u00b5IR is very small, as all numerically sizeable contributions are now available in next-\nto-leading order in QCD, which ensures good cancellation of the scale-dependence. For\nthe \u03c0-DAs we use for the most part the same expressions as in the first reference of [13],\nexcept for the new O(\u03b1s) corrections to T\n(p,\u03c3)\nH , where we use the DAs given in (7), and for\nthe twist-2 DAs, where new analyses of the available experimental data on the \u03b3\u2217\u03b3\u03c0 and\nthe \u03c0 electromagnetic form-factor indicate that \u03c6(2) is closer to its asymptotic form than\nassumed previously and well approximated by [23]\n\u03c6(2)(u, \u00b5IR) = 6u(1\u2212 u)\n{\n1 + a2(\u00b5IR)\n(\n15\n2\n(2u\u2212 1)2 \u2212\n3\n2\n)}\n(12)\n6\n2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nq\n2\nf\n+\n(\nq\n2\n)\nFigure 3: f+(q\n2) as function of momentum-transfer q2 from the LCSR (11).

Using the \u201cstan-\ndard value\u201d of the quark-condensate, \u3008q\u00afq\u3009(1GeV) = (\u22120.24GeV)3, one has \u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5\n2\nIR) =\n0.25GeV2. With the central value for the flavour-averaged light-quark mass, mud(2GeV) =\n4.5MeV, from lattice [21], one has \u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5\n2\nIR) = 0.30GeV\n2, with a quoted uncertainty of 20%.\nIn our analysis we use the average \u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5\n2\nIR) = (0.27\u00b1 0.07)GeV\n2.\nWith these parameters, we obtain the results shown in Fig. 3. The form-factor can be\naccurately fitted by\nf+(q\n2) =\nf+(0)\n1\u2212 a (q2\/m2B) + b (q\n2\/m2B)\n2 , (13)\nwith f+(0), a and b given in Tab. 1, for different values of mb, s0 and M\n2. The above\nparametrization reproduces the actual values calculated from the LCSR, for q2 \u2264 14GeV2,\nto within 2% accuracy. At q2 = 0 we find f+(0) = 0.26\u00b10.06, when all input-parameters are\nvaried within the ranges specified above. This has to be compared to 0.31\u00b1 0.05 from our\nprevious analysis [13]. At fixed M2 = 6GeV2, and the central value for mb, mb = 4.6GeV,\nwe obtain, in this letter, f+(0) = 0.261. Without the new radiative corrections, the result\nbecomes 0.294. Using in addition the parametrization of \u03c6(2) employed in [13], this becomes\n0.321. And switching to mb = 4.8GeV and s0 = 33.5GeV\n2, one obtains 0.308, i.e. the\ncentral value for f+(0) quoted in [13]. The tree-level result for the central values of input-\nparameters is 0.247, i.e. the total effect of radiative corrections is below 10%.\nIt is instructive to compare the parametrization (13), obtained at not too large q2,\nq2 \u2264 14GeV2, with the vector-meson pole-dominance approximation valid at large q2 \u2248\n(mB \u2212m\u03c0)\n2 = 26.4GeV2: here f+ is dominated by the B\n\u2217-pole, located at q2 = m2B\u2217 =\n28.4GeV2, and can be expressed as\nf+(q\n2) =\nc\n1\u2212 q\n2\nm2\nB\u2217\n. (14)\nThe residue of the pole, c, can be related to physical couplings as c = fB\u2217gBB\u2217\u03c0\/(2mB\u2217),\nwhere fB\u2217 is the leptonic decay constant of the B\n\u2217 and gBB\u2217\u03c0 is the coupling of the B\n\u2217 to\n7\nmb[GeV] 4.69 4.60 4.51\ns0[GeV\n2] 33.5 34.0 34.5\na2(1GeV) 0 0.1 0.2\n\u00b52\u03c0(\u00b5\n2\nIR)[GeV\n2] 0.34 0.27 0.20\nM2[GeV2] 8 6 5\nf+(0) 0.206 0.261 0.323\na 2.34 2.03 1.76\nb 1.77 1.29 0.87\nq20[GeV\n2] 14.3 15.7 18.5\ncfit 0.384 0.439 0.523\ncLCSR =\nfB\u2217gBB\u2217\u03c0\n2mB\u2217\n0.396 0.414 0.430\nTable 1: Fit-parameters of Eqs.

To this end, we treat c\nas fit-parameter and require that the transition between both parametrizations be smooth,\ni.e. that at q20 to be fitted, the values of both f+(q\n2\n0) and its derivative are equal for both\nparametrizations. The resulting values of q20 and cfit are tabulated in Tab. 1, and the\ncorresponding form-factors, obtained from plotting (13) for q2 \u2264 q20 and (14) for q\n2 \u2265 q20,\nare shown in Fig. 4. The last row in Tab. 1 gives the values of cLCSR obtained directly from\nthe LCSR calculated in [22, 24]. The agreement between the direct and the fitted values is\nremarkably good, in view of the fact that the LCSR for c is less accurate than ours for f+,\nas it does not include O(\u03b1s) corrections at twist-3. Also the values of q\n2\n0 are well within\nexpectation: sufficiently below the pole on the one hand, but not too small on the other\nhand. Motivated by these results, we suggest a new parametrization of f+ in terms of 5\nparameters: Eq. (13) for q2 \u2264 q20 and Eq. (14) for q\n2 \u2265 q20, with the set of parameters\ngiven in Tab. 1 which comprises the full dependence of f+(q\n2) on input-parameters and\nthe Borel-parameter.\n5. In this letter we have investigated the light-cone sum rule for the form-factor fB\u2192\u03c0+ ,\nincluding the calculation of O(\u03b1s) radiative corrections to the next-to-leading twist-3 con-\ntribution. The calculation has demonstrated the validity of the factorization formula (4)\nand the absence of soft divergent terms to the considered accuracy, i.e. twist-3 to O(\u03b1s)\nwith the DAs in the approximation of leading conformal spin, Eq. (7). As already found\nin [14], the Feynman-mechanism is the dominant contribution to f+ and hard perturbative\ncorrections are numerically small.\nIn view of the systematic uncertainties inherent in LCSRs, further refinement of the\nLCSR for fB\u2192\u03c0+ by including even higher twist contributions or more perturbative correc-\ntions is not likely to increase the overall accuracy.

Solid line obtained from\n3rd column in Tab. 1, lower dashed curve from 2nd column and upper dashed curve from\n4th column.\nresult may, however, come from a reduced uncertainty of input-parameters: whereas the\ndependence of f+(q\n2) on mb is rather small, a reduction of uncertainty in the non-leading\nconformal spin contributions to \u03c6(2) would be useful. As for the approximation of leading\nconformal spin DAs in twist-3, Eq. (7), at tree-level it yields about 90% of the actual result,\nwhich strengthens confidence that this approximation works similarly well also at O(\u03b1s).\nThe change in central values of f+(q\n2) as compared to our previous results, Refs. [13, 14],\nis partially due to the O(\u03b1s) corrections to twist-3 we have calculated in this letter and\npartially due to updated input-parameters.\nThe LCSR is valid only for large energies of the \u03c0, i.e. not too large values of q2. In\nthis letter we have fixed, somewhat arbitrarily, the maximum allowed value of q2 at q2max\nat 14GeV2 and have parametrized the form-factor by Eq. (13). On the other hand, for\nq2 close to the kinematical maximum allowed in semileptonic decays, q2 = 26.4GeV2, the\nform-factor is dominated by the close-by B\u2217-pole and can be parametrized by Eq. (14).\nThe residue of that pole can also be calculated from LCSRs. We have tried to match\nboth parametrizations, Eqs. (13) and (14), by requiring smoothness at the matching-point\nq2 = q20 , which is a parameter of the fit itself. The resulting values of q\n2\n0 are within\nexpectations, and the fitted values of the residue agree well with the direct calculation\nfrom LCSRs, as demonstrated in Tab. 1. This result lends additional confidence to our\nfinal parametrization of the form-factor, i.e. the combination of Eqs. (13) and (14), with a\ntotal of 5 parameters, which is valid in the complete range of kinematically allowed q2 in\nB \u2192 \u03c0e\u03bd, 0 \u2264 q2 \u2264 (mB \u2212m\u03c0)\n2 = 26.4GeV2.\nAppendix\nIn this appendix we collect formulas for non-standard Borel-transformations.
