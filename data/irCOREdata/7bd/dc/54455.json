INTRODUCTION\nRadio frequency (R.F.) induction heating requires a \nhigh frequency AC power supply, typically 100\u2013200 \nkHz. However, the conventional AC-DC-AC converter \ntopology makes use of large energy storage components, \nand requires complicated control algorithms to provide a \nunity power factor sinusoidal input current [1, 2]. Both \nthe systems in [1] and [2] make use of a three-phase \ncontrolled rectifier as the utility supply interface, and a \nPLL-based controller for the DC-AC converter. Other \nsystems [3-6] usually assume that a DC power supply is \navailable, requiring power quality improvements for \ninterfacing to the utility supply, as reviewed in [7, 8]. \nThere have been attempts in improving the power factor \nand input current waveform of the AC-AC converter for \ninduction heating, as reported in [9, 10], however, the \nvoltage drop across the switch on turn off may be much \nhigher than the input voltage, which in turn, may limit the \nsystem to low frequency applications due to the difficulty \nof making high-speed, high-voltage devices. In addition, \nfrequency modulation used for power control may cause \nsome EMC problems at high operating frequencies. \nRecently, matrix converters offering direct AC-AC \nconversion whilst requiring near-zero energy storage \ncomponents, have attracted a great deal of attention. \nAlthough matrix converters are well-known for \nsynthesizing relatively low frequency outputs from the \nutility supply [11-15], there remains limited material \nconcerning the use of matrix converters for high \nfrequency applications, viz. induction heating. Generally, \nas fast switching devices are utilised in matrix converters, \nit is possible to make a high-frequency matrix converter \nas reported in this paper. \nHere, simulation and experimental results from a \nsingle-phase, high-frequency switched matrix converter, \nemployed as an R.F. induction heater, are presented. The \nconverter inherits the simple structure of classic matrix \nconverters, a unity power factor utility supply interface, \nand a practically sinusoidal input current waveform. In \naddition, soft switching has been implemented in the \nconverter, which employing a novel switching control \npattern. \nThe next section presents the operating principles of \nthe proposed single phase matrix converter with the new \nswitching control pattern. Section III highlights the \nfeatures of the proposed topology and switching pattern. \nIn section IV, simulation and experimental results are \ncompared, along with the discussion of those results. \nII.

The \nconverter is a 2x2 matrix converter, in which each \nbidirectional switch is implemented using two MOSFETs \nconnected in common source configuration, utilising the \nbuilt-in diode of the device. Across each bidirectional \nswitch is a commutating capacitor. Capacitors CAX and \nCBX have the same value and are associated with the load-\ncommutated (LC) row. Similarly, CAY and CBY belong to \nthe pulse-width-modulation (PWM) row. The load is an \nLLC resonant circuit, where L1 is the series inductor for \nmatching the parallel resonant tank, consisting of work-\nhead inductance L2, reflected load resistance R2 and tank \ncapacitor CT, with the high frequency voltage source. \nBecause of the presence of the series inductor L1, a \nsimple explanation of the operating principle can be made \nby assuming that the load acts as a sinusoidal current \nsink, and that the devices are ideal. Starting with the load \ncurrent (output current of the matrix converter) crossing \nzero and entering its positive half-cycle, the converter \nwill go through the following modes of operation in the \npositive half-cycle of the input voltage (VAB > 0), Fig. 2. \nMode 1 [t0, t1]: Before this mode, t < t0, switches SAXR\nand SBYR are on, creating a path for the load current in its \nnegative half-cycle, and making zero voltage drop on CAX\nand CBY. The voltage on CAY and CBX will be the \ninstantaneous input voltage VAB. At t = t0, both SAXR and \nSBYR are turned off, and switches SAXF and SBYF are \nturned on under zero-current and zero-voltage condition. \nAs the current is flowing in the diodes associated with \ndevices, the output voltage equals the input voltage VAB.\nMode 2 [t1, t2]: At some time through the switching \ncycle, SBYF is switched off, and its counterpart in the \nopposite phase leg, SAYF, is turned on under zero-current \ncondition, because the built-in diode of SAYR has been \nreversed-biased by the positive voltage drop on CAY. The \nload current will therefore charge up CBY and discharge \nCAY, making the output voltage decrease to zero at t = t2.\nMode 3 [t2, t3]: When CAY is fully discharged, the \nbuilt-in diode of SAYR is forward-biased, and the load \ncurrent will circulate through SAXF and SAYF, making zero \noutput voltage. This condition remains until the load \ncurrent has almost reached zero, when SAXF is turned off \nat t = t3.\nMode 4 [t3, t4]: Similarly, SBXF will be turned on at \nzero current when SAXF is switched off, causing CAX to \ncharge up and CBX to discharge. This will cause the \noutput voltage to further decrease, giving a negative \noutput voltage. \nMode 5 [t4, t5]: At t = t4, when CBX is fully discharged, \nthe built-in diode of SBXR is forward-biased, and the \noutput current will circulate through SAYF and SBXF,\nmaking the output voltage clamped at \u2013VAB. Just before \nthe current reverses, SAYF and SBXF are switched off. \nMode 6 [t5, t6]: At the same time SAYF and SBXF are \nturned off, at t = t5, SAYR and SBXR are switched on under \nzero-voltage and zero-current condition. The output \nvoltage equals \u2013VAB and the current will circulate through \nSAYR and SBXR, starting the negative half-cycle. \nMode 7 [t6, t7]: Part way through the cycle, SAYR is \nturned off and SBYR is switched on, at t = t6. The load \ncurrent will then be carried by CAY and CBY, causing the \noutput voltage to increase until it reaches zero, at which \ntime the built-in diode of SBYF becomes forward-biased. \nMode 8 [t7, t8]: This mode is similar to mode 3, when \nthe load current circulates through SBXR and SBYR, giving \nzero output voltage. This condition remains until the \noutput current is almost zero, when SBXR switches off, at t \n= t8.\nMode 9 [t8, t9]: At the same time SBXR is turned off, \nSAXR will be switched on under zero-current condition, \ncausing CAX to discharge and CBX to charge up. This will \ncause the output voltage to further increase, giving a \npositive output voltage. \nMode 10 [t9, t10]: At t = t9, when CAX is fully \ndischarged, the built-in diode of SAXR is forward-biased, \nand the output current will circulate through SAXR and \nSBYR, making the output voltage clamp at VAB. Just \nbefore the current reverses, SAXR and SBYR are switched \noff, and SAXF and SBYF are turned on under a zero-current \nand zero-voltage condition, starting a new output cycle. \nFor the negative half-cycle of input voltage, switches \nSAXF and SBXF, SAYF and SBYF, SAXR and SBXR, and SAYR\nand SBYR exchange their role, respectively. \nAs may be seen, in addition to zero-current switching \non or zero-voltage zero-current switching on, all the \nswitches are switched off under zero-voltage condition, \nwith the support of commutating capacitors rapidly \nremoving the current from the switches. \nIII.  FEATURES\nThe converter inherits the simple structure of classic \nmatrix converters, and utilises small commutating \ncapacitors, making a more compact construction without \nany bulky and unreliable electrolytic capacitors. \nOperating at high frequency, the converter only \nrequires a small line filter at the interface to the utility \nsupply, resulting in unity power factor sinusoidal input \ncurrent. \nAs described in the previous section, soft switching \nhas been implemented in the converter, proposing a new \nswitching control pattern. In line with conventional \nmatrix converters, there are two basic commutation \nstrategies, namely \u201cvoltage commutation\u201d, which requires \nthe knowledge of the sign of input voltage, and \u201ccurrent \ncommutation\u201d, which needs the knowledge of the sign of \noutput current [12, 16]. These strategies can be made in \nfour-steps or two-steps, requiring little dead time between \nthe steps. The commutation strategy used in the proposed \nconverter falls in the category of voltage commutation, \nusing the sign of the input voltage to select an appropriate \nswitching pattern. The commutation, however, does not \nneed to ensure a path for the inductive load current, \nowing to the support of the commutating capacitors, and \nthe single-step switching pattern is therefore proposed, as \nmay be seen in Fig. 1(b). \nS18 - 29\n \n<Mode 1> \n<Mode 2> \n<Mode 3> \n<Mode 4> \n<Mode 5> \n<Mode 6> \n<Mode 7> \n<Mode 8> \n<Mode 9> \n<Mode 10> \nFig. 2.

The power \nis controlled by varying the switching angle of the pulse-\nwidth-modulation row, instead of varying the switching \nfrequency. This helps reduce the EMC problems \nassociated with the power control method of frequency \nmodulation. \nIn comparison to other single phase converters for \ninduction heating, the proposed converter, with its new \nswitching control pattern, has the advantages of simple \nsingle-stage structure, unity power factor sinusoidal input \ncurrent, low losses due to soft switching over a wide \nrange of power control. \nIV.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nThe proposed converter has been built and tested at \ninput 240 V(rms) for output powers up to 1000 W. The \ncircuit parameters are: Lf = 575 \u03bcH, Cf = 1 \u03bcF, CAX = CBX\n= 4.7 nF, CAY = CBY = 10 nF, L1 = 16.4 \u03bcH, CT = 0.2435 \n\u03bcF, the power switch is IXYS-IXFK34N80. The water-\ncooled load has an inductance of 3.6 \u03bcH and a reflected \nresistance of 2.35 \u03a9 at a frequency of 182 kHz.

CONCLUSIONS\nPreliminary results from radio frequency induction \nheater, employing a matrix converter, with unity power \nfactor, and sinusoidal input current, have been presented. \nThe proposed topology and switching pattern ensure soft \nswitching over a wide range of power control. The \nproposed single-step voltage commutation is very simple \nand has been implemented without any additional \ncomponents. It is therefore possible to make a direct \nconverter for induction heating, without having any \nsignificant impact on the utility supply, and with the \nadvantages of simple structure, and low losses. \nREFERENCES\n[1] Bayindir, N.S.; Kukrer, O.; Yakup, M.: DSP-based PLL-\ncontrolled 50\u2013100 kHz 20 kW high-frequency induction \nheating system for surface hardening and welding \napplications.
