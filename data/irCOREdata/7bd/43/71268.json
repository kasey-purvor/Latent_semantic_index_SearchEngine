INTRODUCTION\nTracking a group of targets in a video sequence is a common\nproblem in many video surveillance applications. Video sur-\nveillance addresses real-time observation of targets such as\nhumans or vehicles in some environment, leading to a de-\nscription of the objects\u2019 activities with the environment or\namong them. It has been used for security monitoring [3], [4],\n0-7803-9546-8\/06\/ $20.00\/ c\u00a92006 IEEE\nIEEEAC paper # 1280\nas well as for traffic flow measuring [5], accident detection on\nhighways, and routine maintenance in nuclear facilities.\nThis paper addresses the problem of tracking multiple tar-\ngets in video sequences. The objective is to detect and track\ntargets which can undergo non-rigid deformations, rotations\nor partial occlusions. Tracking is based on multiple inde-\npendent particle filters and the Probabilistic Data Association\n(PDA) algorithm which afford to handle the uncertainty due\nto the measurement origin. The data association algorithm\nalso helps to recover from partial occlusions. The proposed\nalgorithm can estimate the number of active targets in the\nvideo sequence and can accordingly increase the number of\ntracking filter(s) or stop unwanted tracking filter(s).\nIn many of the previously developed tracking techniques, the\nfirst fundamental problem encountered is the object segmen-\ntation which extracts the areas (or objects) of interest from the\nscene. The extracted regions are used as measurements (ob-\nservations) for tracking algorithms. These foreground seg-\nmentation techniques are typically computationally expen-\nsive because they operate over the whole image scene [6].\nAlgorithms which attempt to find the target of interest with-\nout using segmentation have been proposed for single target\ntracking based on cues such as colour, edges and textures [1].\nRecently, the integrated detection and tracking using parti-\ncles has been extended for multiple targets. Many of these\nschemes rely on hybrid sequential state estimation. In [2],\nthe state vector denoting all the existing targets is augmented\nby a discrete random variable which represents the number\nof existing objects in a video sequence. The particle filter\ndeveloped in [7] has multiple models for the object motion,\nand comprises an additional discrete state component, de-\nnoting which of the motion models is active. The Bayesian\nMultiple-Blob Tracker (BraMBLe) [8] presents a multiple-\nperson tracking system based on statistical appearance mod-\nels. The multiple blob tracking is managed by incorporating\nthe number of objects present in the state vector and state vec-\ntor is augmented as in [2] when a new object enters the scene.\nThe problem of multiple target tracking is more challenging\nthan the single target tracking and several issues which do\nnot exist for single target tracking, has to be resolved for the\nsuccessful application of multiple target tracking algorithms.\nOne issue is the management of multiple tracks caused by\nnewly appearing targets and the disappearance of already ex-\nisting targets. In the references mentioned before, this is\nhandled by the hybrid state estimation framework for joint\ntracking of all existing targets (with an extended state vec-\ntor). Joint tracking of targets avoids the possibility of several\nindependent filters, but the identity of the individual targets\nmight be lost, especially when targets are close to each other.\nA separate single tracking filter can be applied to multiple\ntarget tracking, only when all targets are fairly well spaced.\nWhen the targets are closer and\/or cross each other, it has\nbeen shown in aerospace applications [9], [10], [11], that data\nassociation techniques can be used to track without loosing\nthe identity of each targets. However, the methods developed\nin [12] for radar data are not applicable to vision problems\ndue to the absence of measurement equations in explicit form.\nIn [12] the varying number of targets is estimated via cluster-\ning techniques and the data association is performed by the\n2-D assignment algorithm (see e.g. the review from Chapter\n2 of [13]).\nIn this paper, a sequential Monte Carlo version of the data\nassociation scheme is presented for tracking multiple targets\nand the track management is handled by existence probabili-\nties calculated from the data association stage. This proposed\nscheme is simple and does not demand high computational\nresources.\nThis paper is organised as follows. The model of the mov-\ning object is described in section 2. The particle filter (PF)\nJPDA algorithm is given in section 3. Section 4 yields the\nnew implemented Joint PDA scheme. Section 5 contains the\nexperimental results, followed by a discussion in section 6.\nFinally, the conclusions are highlighted in section 7.\n2. PROBLEM FORMULATION\nThe aim is to sequentially perform simultaneous detection\nand tracking of objects described by the same specified colour\nhistogram q\u2217, in a video sequence Zk = {z1,z2, . . . ,zk},\nwhere zk denotes the image (vector of pixel values) at dis-\ncrete time instant k. The state space approach requires\nto specify a motion model, i.e., the evolution of the state\np(xk|xk\u22121), and a measurement model, i.e., the link between\nstate and current measurement p(zk|xk). The next two sub-\nsections describe the model of the object motion and the mea-\nsurement likelihood function.\nState vector and dynamic model\nThe state vector at frame k of a single object typically consists\nof kinematic and region (or shape) parameters. For simplic-\nity we use the random walk model, with the following state\nvector xk = [xk, yk]\nT\n, where (xk, yk) denotes the center\nof the image region used for the colour histogram computa-\ntion. Note that other variables can be added, such as width\nand height of image region, velocities and scale change rate,\ndepending on the application. The state dynamics is typically\ndescribed by a linear model:\nxk = Fxk\u22121 + vk\u22121 (1)\nwhere F is the transition matrix (F = I for our random walk\nmodel) and vk\u22121 is the process noise, assumed to be white,\nzero-mean, Gaussian, with a covariance matrix Q.\nColour measurement model\nThe work described in this paper is based on colour measure-\nment cue. Other measurements cues, e.g. texture, edges or\nmotion and joint variations of any of them can be used as\nthe measurement cue. The choice of the specific cue depends\non many factors such as the resolution of the video, back-\nground\/foreground environment and dynamic nature of the\ntargets to be tracked. Following [14], [15], we do not use the\nentire image zk as a measurement, but rather we extract from\nthe image the colour histogram qk, computed inside the im-\nage region that is specified by the state vector xk. The center\nis defined by (xk, yk). Furthermore, we adopt the Gaussian\ndensity for the likelihood function of the measured colour his-\ntogram as follows:\np(qk|xk) \u221d N (Dk; 0, \u03c32) = 1\u221a\n2pi\u03c3\nexp\n{\n\u2212D\n2\nk\n2\u03c32\n}\n, (2)\nwhere Dk is the distance between the reference histogram q\u2217\nof objects to be tracked and the histogram qk computed from\nthe current frame zk in the region specified by the state vector\nxk. The standard deviation \u03c3 of the Gaussian density in (2)\nis a design parameter.\nIf the two histograms are calculated over U bins, the distance\nDk between two histograms is derived in [14] from the Bhat-\ntacharya similarity coefficient and defined as:\nD2k = 1\u2212\n\u2211U\nu=0\n\u221a\nq\u2217(u)qk(u).\n3. MULTIPLE TARGET TRACKING\nThe multiple target tracking is based on a sequential Monte\nCarlo filter and a Monte Carlo data association is avoiding\nthe ambiguities caused by the different measurement origin.\nIn this section, we explain the conceptual ideas behind the\nparticle filter.\nSequential Monte Carlo\nSequential Monte Carlo techniques also known as particle fil-\ntering and condensation algorithm and their applications in\nthe specific context of visual tracking, have been described in\nlength in the literature [16], [17], [18].\nFor tracking the object of interest, the posterior state distri-\nbution p(xk|Zk), also known as filtering distribution has to\nbe calculated at each time step. In Bayesian sequential esti-\nmation the filtering distribution can be computed according\nto the two step recursion: prediction step\np(xk|Zk\u22121) =\n\u222b\np(xk|xk\u22121)p(xk\u22121|Zk\u22121)dxk\u22121, (3)\nand\nfiltering step\np(xk|Zk) \u221d p(zk|xk)p(xk|Zk\u22121), (4)\nwhere the prediction step follows from marginalisation, and\nthe new filtering distribution is obtained through a direct ap-\nplication of the Bayes\u2019 rule. This recursion requires the spec-\nification of a dynamic model (see section 2) describing the\nstate evolution, p(xk|xk\u22121) and a model that gives the like-\nlihood of any state in the light of the current observation,\np(zk|xk). The recursion is initialised with some distribu-\ntion for the initial state p(x0). Once the sequence of filter-\ning distribution is known, point estimates of the state can\nbe obtained according to any appropriate function, leading\nfor example to the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate,\nargmaxxk p(xk|Zk), and to the Minimum Mean Square Er-\nror (MMSE) estimate, \u222b xkp(xk|Zk)dxk.\nThe basic idea behind the particle filter is very simple. Start-\ning with a weighted set of samples {x(i)k\u22121, w(i)k\u22121}Ni=1 approx-\nimately distributed according to p(xk\u22121|Zk\u22121), new samples\nare generated from a suitable proposal distribution, which\nmay depend on the previous state and the new measurements,\ni.e., x(i)k \u223c qp(xk|x(i)k\u22121,zk), i = 1, . . . , N . To maintain a\nconsistent sample, the new importance weights are set to\nw\n(i)\nk \u221d w(i)k\u22121\np(zk|x(i)k )p(x(i)k |x(i)k\u22121)\nqp(xk|x(i)k\u22121,zk)\n, (5)\nwith\n\u2211N\ni=1 w\n(i)\nk = 1. The new particle set {x(i)k , w(i)k }Ni=1 is\nthen approximately distributed according to p(xk|Zk). The\nperformance of the particle filter depends on the quality of the\nproposal distribution. In this paper, we use the state evolution\nmodel p(xk|xk\u22121) as a proposal distribution and this makes\nthe new importance weights in (5) become proportional to the\ncorresponding particle likelihoods. This implementation of\nthe sequential Monte Carlo method corresponds to the boot-\nstrap filter as proposed in [19].\n4. JOINT PROBABILITY DATA ASSOCIATION\nData association is a problem of crucial importance for multi-\nple target tracking because of the necessity to relate each mea-\nsurement to the correct object. Several methods have been\nproposed in the estimation and tracking literature [9], [10].\nIn general multi-target tracking deals with state estimation of\nan unknown number of targets. Some methods consider spe-\ncial cases with a constant or known number of targets. The\nobservations are assumed to originate from different targets\nor from clutter. The clutter is a special type of the so-called\nfalse alarms, whose statistical properties are different from\nthe targets. In some applications only one measurement is as-\nsumed available from each target, where in other applications\nseveral returns are available. This will of course reflect which\ndata association method to use.\nSeveral classical data association methods exist [20]. The\nsimplest is the nearest neighbour (NN) method. In [9], this\nis referred to as the nearest neighbour standard filter and it\nuses only the closest observation to any given state to per-\nform the measurement update step. The method can also be\nimplemented as a global optimisation, so that the total num-\nber of observations for tracking the statistical distance is min-\nimised. Another multi-target tracking association method is\nthe Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) which is an\nextension of the Probability Data Association algorithm [9]\nto multiple targets. It estimates the states by a sum over all\nthe association hypothesis weighted by the probabilities from\nthe likelihood. The most general data association method is\na computationally intensive algorithm called the multiple hy-\npothesis tracking (MHT), which calculates every possible up-\ndate hypothesis [21]. In [22], the so-called probabilistic MHT\n(PMHT) method is presented, using a maximum-likelihood\nmethod in combination with the expectation maximisation\n(EM) method. A comparative study of JPDAF and PMHT\nis made in [23].\nIn [24], the solution to the assignment problem for data as-\nsociation is proposed within the Bayesian framework by in-\ncorporating the association in the estimation equations. In\n[25], [26], this idea is suggested for particle filtering, when\nthe problem of maintaining a track on a target in the presence\nof intermittent spurious objects. Samples are drawn from the\noverall target probability density. The so-called joint-filter in\n[27] is a solution to the joint data association and estimation\nproblem for particle filters. The estimation is performed by\na particle filter and a Gibbs sampler [28] is used for the data\nassociation. The case with unknown number of targets is han-\ndled by a multiple hypotheses test.\nIn this paper, the JPDA approach is used, which is an ex-\ntension of the PDA approach [9], [10] for single targets. In\nthe JPDA, a known number of targets \u03c4 is assumed. The in-\ndex t = {1, . . . , \u03c4} designates one among the \u03c4 targets. The\nmeasurements at time step k are denoted as zk = {zjk}mkj=0,\nwhere an artificial measurement z0 is introduced to handle\nfalse alarms or clutter and the number of measurements is\ngiven by mk. The measurement to target association proba-\nbilities are evaluated jointly across the targets. Let \u03b8 denotes\nthe joint association event (the time index k is omitted for\nsimplicity) and \u03b8jt is the particular event which assigns the\nmeasurement j to the target t. By assuming that the estima-\ntion problem is Markovian and by applying the Bayes\u2019 theo-\nrem, the joint association probabilities are\nP (\u03b8|Zk) = 1\nc\np(zk|\u03b8,Xk)P (\u03b8|Xk), (6)\nwhere c is a normalisation constant andXk = {x1, . . . ,xk}.\nAdditionally, it is assumed that the measurements are de-\ntected independently of each other. The probability of the as-\nsignment \u03b8 conditioned on the sequence of the targets\u2019 states\nP (\u03b8|Xk) is approximated by\nP (\u03b8|Xk) = P \u03c4\u2212nD (1\u2212 PD)nPmk\u2212(\u03c4\u2212n)FA , (7)\nwhere PD denotes the probability of detection, n is the num-\nber of z0 assignments and PFA denotes the probability of\nfalse alarm.\nThe innovation between the j-th measurement zjk and the\npredicted measurement z\u02c6jt,k of target t at time step k is\n\u03bdjt,k = z\nj\nk \u2212 z\u02c6jt,k and Sjt,k is the corresponding innovation\ncovariance matrix. Then the normalised innovation djt,k is\ndefined as\ndjt,k = (\u03bd\nj\nt,k)\nT (Sjt,k)\n\u22121\u03bdjt,k. (8)\nBy assuming that the measurement is of dimension M , it fol-\nlows that the M -dimensional Gaussian association likelihood\nfor the j-th measurement to the target t\np(\u03bdjt,k) =\n1\n(2pi)M\/2|Sjt,k|1\/2\nexp\n{\n\u2212(djt,k)2\n2\n}\n, (9)\nwhere |Sjt,k| is the determinant of Sjt,k.\nFinally, the probability of an individual joint association event\nis given by\nP (\u03b8|Zk) = P \u03c4\u2212nD (1\u2212 PD)nPmk\u2212(\u03c4\u2212n)FA\n\u220f\n\u03b8jt\u2208\u03b8\np(\u03bdjt,k). (10)\nAs shown in [29], the number of associations increases expo-\nnentially with an increase in the number of measurements and\ntargets, rendering the use of all hypothesis infeasible for even\nmoderate values for these quantities. The number of possi-\nble associations \u03bb, given that ND of the \u03c4 targets have been\ndetected, is\nN\u03bbk(ND, \u03c4) =\nmk!\u03c4 !\nND!(mk \u2212ND)!(\u03c4 \u2212ND)! (11)\nand so the total number of possible hypotheses (since ND is\nnot known) is\nmin(mk,\u03c4)\u2211\nND=0\nN\u03bbk(ND, \u03c4). (12)\nEven for the case of three targets and three measurements,\nthis amounts to 34 hypotheses. Therefore, in practice, it is\ncommon to apply gating techniques [9] to reduce the number\nof hypotheses and the computational cost respectively.\nMonte Carlo JPDA\nIn this subsection, we describe the Monte Carlo JPDA used in\nour tracking algorithm. The Monte Carlo version of JPDA has\nbeen studied by several authors (see e.g. [30], [31]). A recent\npaper of Vermaak et al. [32] surveys most of the approaches\ndeveloped earlier. In [32] marginal filtering distributions for\neach of the targets are represented with Monte Carlo samples,\nor particles, instead of based on a Gaussian approximation,\nas it is done in the standard JPDAF. The JPDA particle filter\nimplemented in our paper is given below:\nThe JPDA particle filter for multiple target tracking\n1. Initialisation.\nSet k = 0, generate N samples x(i)t,0 for all targets\nt = 1, . . . , \u03c4 independently. x(i)t,0 is drawn from p(xt,0),\nfor i = 1, . . . , N particles\n2. For t = 1, . . . , \u03c4 targets,\nFor j = 0, . . . ,mk measurements\nCompute \u03b2jt,k =\n\u2211\n\u03b8jt,k\u2208\u03b8 P (\u03b8|Zk) as the\nsummation over all the joint events in which the\nmarginal event \u03b8jt,k of interest occurs.\nFor i = 1, . . . N particles compute the independent\nweights for each particle according to\nw\n(i)\nt,k =\n\u2211mk\nj=0 \u03b2\nj\nt,kp(z\nj\nk|x(i)t,0) and normalise the\nweights for each target: w\u02dc(i)t,k =\nw\n(i)\nt,k\nPN\ni=1 w\n(i)\nt,k\n.\nFor each target, generate a new set {x(i\u2217)t,k }Ni=1,\nby resampling with N times from {x(i)t,k}Ni=1, where\nP (x(i\u2217)t,k = x\n(i),t\nt,k ) = w\u02dc\n(i)\nt,k.\nFor i = 1, . . . N predict new particles\nx\n(i)\nt,k+1 = Fx\n(i\u2217)\nt,k + v\n(i)\nt,k.\nEnd For\nEnd For\n3. Increase k and iterate to step 2.\nThe algorithm assumes knowledge of the maximum number\nof targets, \u03c4 . It starts with a single filter with uniformly dis-\ntributed particles across the image scene. The variance of this\nfilter is used to monitor the convergence of the filter. Once\nthis filter shows convergence (by convergence we mean that\nthe variance of the PF, is less than a certain threshold value)\na new filter is initialised with particles a priori uniformly dis-\ntributed across the image except at the region around the tar-\nget tracked by the first filter. The prior around the region\ntracked by the first filter (the exclusion region) is zero. This\nselection of prior distribution avoids the likelihood of two fil-\nters tracking the same object. The variance of this second\nfilter monitors the convergence of the new filter. Once the\nsecond filter reaches convergence, another filter is initialised\nwith a prior from the region not covered by the first two fil-\nters. During the tracking process the number of objects and\nthe identity of active objects are estimated as shown in the\nnext paragraph. This is used to detect when an object disap-\npears from the scene and to stop the corresponding tracking\nfilter.\nLet P (Ht|Zk) (t = 1, . . . , \u03c4) denote the posterior probabil-\nity of the existence of t number of targets. In general, this\nprobability depends on the \u2018full\u2019 hypothesis list which con-\nsiders all possible hypotheses from frame 1 to frame k. How-\never, it can be approximately estimated from the hypotheses\nassumed in the Monte Carlo JPDA. According to the total\nprobability theorem, the existence probability of t number of\ntargets is given by\nP (Ht|Zk) =\n\u2211\n\u03b8\u2208\u03c7t\nP (\u03b8|Zk), t = 1, . . . , \u03c4. (13)\nwhere \u03c7t is the event (hypothesis) that t number of targets\nexists. Similarly to this, joint existence probabilities of spe-\ncific targets (such as the existence of target 1 with target 2 or\ntarget 1 with target 3) also can be estimated. Let Ht1,t2,...,t\u03c1\nbe the hypothesis that t1, t2, . . . , t\u03c1 targets exist, with \u03c1 being\nthe number of active targets. Then the existence probability\nof this event is given by:\nP (Ht1,t2,...,t\u03c1 |Zk) =\n\u2211\n\u03b8\u2208\u03c7t1,t2,...,t\u03c1\nP (\u03b8|Zk), (14)\nwhere \u03c7t1,t2,...,t\u03c1 denotes the events that targets {t1, t2, . . . , t\u03c1}\nexist. These probabilities are used for the purpose of track\nmanagement. If a target (tracked by the algorithm) disap-\npears from the scene, the changes in the number of objects\nis reflected in the probabilities P (Ht|Zk). From the proba-\nbilities P (Ht1,t2,...,t\u03c1 |Zk), we can obtain the identity of the\ntarget which just disappeared. Accordingly, we can stop the\ncorresponding filter and reinitialise for tracking a new target.\nThe use of these probabilities in track management is further\nexplained in the next section with examples.\n5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe proposed algorithm is tested over real-world video se-\nquences with a changing number of football players (the same\nas in [2]). The aim is to track all red players. The max-\nimum number of targets is three (\u03c4 = 3). The algorithm\nis implemented with N = 500 samples for each filter, with\nU = 128\u00d7128\u00d7128 number of bins for the colour cue, with\na system noise covariance Q = diag{15, 15} and a mea-\nsurement noise covariance \u03c32 = 0.12. The number of mea-\nsurements available is mk = 3 and they are obtained from\nimage regions specified by the state vector. When the number\nof objects being tracked is less than mk = 3, the remain-\ning observations are image regions pointing to a region with\nno relevant colour information. This serves as clutter in the\nvisual tracking process.\nFigure 3 shows several frames to illustrate the work of the\nproposed algorithm. At frame 1, one filter is initialised with\nrandom samples uniformly spread all over the image frame.\nAs shown in Figure 1 (frame 20), this filter initially attempts\nto track all red players but gradually converges to the red per-\nson on the right (frame 40). At frame 41, a new filter is ini-\ntialised with an initial prior distribution uniformly distributed\nacross all regions except the region around the already tracked\nobject. The frame 41 shows these samples. This selection of\nthe initial prior avoids the occurrence of a new filter tracking\nthe already tracked person by the first filter. At frame 52, both\nfilters are tracking two persons and at frame 53, a new filter\n(third filter) is initialised with a prior covering all regions ex-\ncept two regions already tracked by first two filters. After\nten frames (at frame 63), all three objects are tracked by the\nproposed algorithm.\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nPr (one target is active)\nPr (two targets are active)\nFrame number\nPr (three targets are active)\nFigure 1.

Probabilities of joint existence of possible two\ntargets\nAt frame 82, the person tracked by the first filter leaves the\nscene. This is also indicated by the changes in the joint exis-\ntence probabilities shown in Figure 1. As seen from the Fig-\nure 1, the dominant probability changes from the probability\nof having three objects to the the probability of having two\nobjects. As seen from frame 83, the first filter was stopped\nwhen the person disappeared. The same filter is initialised to\nFrame 1 Frame 20\nFigure 3. Image frames of a football sequence: detected and tracked players are marked with a rectangle and the circles denote\nthe locations of particles\ntrack any new objects appearing in the image scene. The ini-\ntialisation is similar to the earlier one and the initial samples\nare obtained from regions not covered by the two tracking\nfilters (the 2nd and the 3rd). It is important to know which\nobject disappeared and which filter is reinitialised. Figure 2\nshows different existence probabilities of having two objects\n(i.e., probabilities of having object 1 with 2, 1 with 3, and 2\nwith 3). Figure 2 indicates also that around the frame 82 the\nprobability of having objects 2 and 3 is very high compared\nto other possibilities. This illustrates that the object 1 is the\ndisappeared object and we can reinitialise then filter 1.\n6. DISCUSSION\nAdvantages of the proposed algorithm are its computational\nsimplicity. The technique developed can be extended to deal\nwith full occlusions, e.g. when the targets cross their paths.\nIn order to be able to cope with full occlusions, unique fea-\ntures from each target are required, which is an open issue for\nfuture research. Additionally, separate detection techniques,\nsuch as image segmentation, can be used to detect the targets\nand to speed up the process of target track initiation. Inves-\ntigations are currently going on the development of adaptive\ncues able to deal with changeable illumination on the scene.\n7. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper presents a JPDA particle filter for multiple targets\ntracking in video sequences. The experimental results from\nreal video sequences show its reliable performance. The al-\ngorithm is characterised with low computational complexity\nand is able to cope with partial occlusions and recover after\ntemporary loss. We evaluate the number of objects in the cur-\nrent frame and the track management is handled using proba-\nbilities of the number of objects in the same frame.\nAcknowledgements.
