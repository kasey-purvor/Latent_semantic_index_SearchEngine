Global spaces of \nlearning in advertising professional service firms \n \n \n1) Introduction \nThe role of knowledge pervades discussions of factors affecting the \nsuccess of organisations (Bryson et al, 2000) whilst academics (Davenport and \nPrusak, 1998) and governments (Department for Trade and Industry, 1998) are \npreoccupied with the implications of the \u2018knowledge economy\u2019.  Fuelled by this and \nthe burgeoning literature on knowledge management in \norganizational\/management studies (e.g. Brown and Duguid, 2000), economic \ngeographers have sought to describe the geographical influences upon the \ncreation and dissemination of economically valuable knowledges, one of their main \ncontributions being to highlight the \u2018new regions\u2019 and their ability to produce and \ninternally disseminate tacit knowledge (Lawson and Lorenz, 1999; Morgan, 2004).  \nHowever, for many (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Bathelt et al, 2004), and especially \nAllen (2000), there is concern that such work might reinforce the unfounded \nassociation of tacit knowledge, its production and dissemination, with \u201csolely the \ncreation of territorially specific actions and assets \u2013 restricted to\u2026regions, places \nor other such spatial confines\u201c.  This, according to Allen \u201cis highly questionable and \nreflects the delimiting vision of a powerful set of discourses\u201d (Allen, 2000, p27), \ndiscourses that create a misleading dualism between tacit and explicit knowledge \nand local and global geographies respectively.  Scholars have, therefore, called for \nbetter understanding of the multiple geographies of knowledge through research \nof local but also global relational spaces of learning and the different types of \nknowledge leverage practices that operate in global firms (Bunnel and Coe, 2001; \nCurrah and Wrigley, 2004).   \n 4\nThis paper aims to help further dismantle the dualism between tacit-local \nand explicit-global geographies of knowledge and deepen, whilst also \nsynthesising, the understanding provided by geographers of the spatial influences \non learning and knowledge in global organizations.  It does this by examining how \nlearning and knowledge is globally stretched in advertising professional service \nfirms (PSFs), a sector where facets of internationalization have been only \nsporadically studied by geographers (e.g. Daniels, 1995).  Knowledge \nmanagement is vital for such firms because of the intangible, knowledge intensive \nnature of producing effective advertising and the advantages that can be gained \nfrom reconciling the knowledge of individuals located across a spatially distributed \noffice network.  Two key arguments are made in the paper about the geographies \nof knowledge and learning in such organizations.   \nFirst, it is suggested that whilst calls to recognise the affects of cultural and \ninstitutional influences on the application of economic knowledges and practices \nand therefore the local stickiness of tacit knowledge (Gertler, 2001; 2003; 2004 \nWhitley, 2005) provide valuable insight into the challenges of \u2018knowledge \ntransfer\u2019 in organizations, those who recognise the possibility of spatially stretched \nlearning that operates beyond scale-defined limits (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; \nBunnel and Coe, 2001, Wenger, 1998) point to an important and alternative form of \nknowledge leverage, the \u2018social production of knowledge\u2019.  The paper argues \nthat, consequently, we must recognise a fundamental difference in epistemology \nbetween studies of the practice of knowledge transfer and the \u2018social production of \nknowledge\u2019 in organizations and the different spatial constraints on each practice.  \nThis means organizational learning and knowledge management practices have \ncomplex spatial dynamics that cannot simply be defined using a local-global binary \n(Wolfe and Gertler 2004) and that the dismissal of suggestions of global \ngeographies of tacit knowledge might be too hasty.   \n 5\nSecond, and related to the first, the paper also argues that strategies in \nglobal organisations to exploit, configure and create what are referred to as global \npractice-based and relational spaces of learning (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Blanc \nand Sierra, 1999) are central to creating global spaces and geographies of \nlearning in organizations.  These strategies decouple the cognitive spaces and \nsocially embedded relations involved in learning and knowledge production from \nthe local scale, therefore suggesting we need more complex arguments about the \n\u2018social\u2019 characteristics of learning than some scholars arguing for locally fixed \ngeographies of learning (e.g. Morgan, 2004; Storper and Venables, 2003) have \nprovided.  The rest of the paper develops these arguments over six further \nsections. \nSection two engages with literature outlining models of organizational \nlearning with, in particular, work on the role of global knowledge transfer and global \n\u2018communities of practice\u2019 examined in order to outline debates about the \ngeographies of tacit knowledge.  Sections three to five then explore the nature of \nglobally stretched learning in advertising PSFs through detailed empirical material.  \nThis reveals that globally stretched learning involves predominantly the social \nproduction of new knowledge rather than knowledge transfer.  It also shows how \nglobally stretched learning is possible in \u2018practice-based\u2019 and \u2018relational spaces of \nlearning\u2019 that are controlled and created by the firms involved in order to allow a \ndegree of \u2018cognitive convergence\u2019 and the development of \u2018embedded relational \nnetworks\u2019.  Section six then evaluates the significance of these findings for how we \nstudy the geographies of tacit knowledge.   \n  \n2) Emerging global geographies of learning \nAccording to a number of studies (e.g. Gertler, 2004; Keeble et al, 1999; \nLawson and Lorenz, 1999; Morgan, 2004), regions\/clusters are particularly \neffective at nurturing the production of knowledge.  At the heart of such \n 6\nsuggestions is discussion of the role of regional cultural and institutional \nframeworks, face-to-face contact and the development of local relational networks.  \nThe finer points of these arguments are returned to below.  However, it is also \nimportant to recognise a rising tide of work suggesting that the knowledge \neconomy, and learning more widely, has global geographies (Allen, 2000; Amin \nand Cohendet, 2004).  Table 1 summarises the key tenets of such work and the \npractices of global learning that create \u201ca highly integrated, network organisation \nfor the core competencies of the firm\u201d that \u201callows the firm to benefit from \n\u2018decentralised specialisation\u2019 by coupling islands of localised [tacit] knowledge\u201d \n(Amin and Cohendet, 1999, 94).  These studies suggest that focus should fall on \nthe interconnections of a global knowledge economy as well as the regional \u2018hot-\nspots\u2019 and, consequently, that the development of more intricate \nconceptualisations of the influence of space and place on knowledge and learning \nare needed.  \n \n[Insert table 1 here] \n \nThe concept of communities of practice (see in particular Wenger, 1998; \nWenger et al, 2000) has gained significant intellectual currency over recent years \nand has been widely used as part of attempts to enhance the elegance of space \nsensitive examinations of learning.  Within such literatures the existence of globally \nstretched communities or \u2018constellations of practice\u2019 is highlighted with a number of \nscholars (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Blanc and Sierra, 1999; Wenger, 1998) \narguing that the fundamental characteristics of communities of practice that enable \nlearning - the existence of a group of individuals with a shared enterprise, \nengagement and repertoire that provides a shared context, understanding and way \nof expressing this understanding \u2013 stretch beyond local communities.  Therefore \nas Wenger et al (2002, 25) note: \n 7\n \n\u201c\u2026many communities start among people who work at the same place or live nearby.  \nBut colocation is not a necessity.  Many communities of practice are distributed over \nwide areas.  Some communities meet regularly\u2026Others are connected primarily by e-\nmail and phone and may meet only once or twice a year.  What allows members to \nshare knowledge is not the choice of a specific form of communication (face-to-face \nas opposed to Web-based, for instance) but the existence of a shared practice \u2013 a \ncommon set of situations, problems and perspectives\u201d. \n \nBlanc and Sierra (1999) exemplify the globality of such communities and learning \nthrough analysis of the internationalization of R&D in global organizations.  They \nargue that global \u2018spaces of proximity\u2019 allow globally stretched learning because of \nthe existence of: \n \n\u2022 Organizational proximity (common approaches, language and job roles \nspecific to a firm);  \n\u2022 Relational proximity (shared ethos, language and approach to work \neveryone in an industry shares).   \n\u2022 Institutional proximity (shared \u2018rules of the game\u2019 specific to a firm or \nindustry); and \n\u2022 Temporal proximity (a shared vision of how things should be in the future \nand where the industry is at present and ultimately heading).   \n \nSuch work suggests that, at a theoretical level, there is a strong rationale \nsupporting the possibility of globally stretched learning.  However, whilst striving to \ndeconstruct the local-tacit\/global-explicit binary, geographers have also been quick \nto temper hyperbole suggesting globalization results in \u2018the end of geography\u2019 and \nthe \u2018death of distance\u2019 when it comes to knowledge \u2018flows\u2019 (Storper and Venables, \n 8\n2003).  In particular, astute analyses of the socio-cultural embeddedness of many \nforms of knowledge and economic practice deserve our consideration when \ntheorising the spatiality of knowledge and learning. \nExemplary of this approach is the work of Meric Gertler (2001; 2003; 2004) \nwho identifies the potential importance of \u2018local\u2019 cultural and institutional values in \nrestricting the effectiveness of globally stretched learning.  He argues that regions, \nand the knowledge flows between firms in a region, seem likely to remain the \npredominant way for tacit knowledge to be leveraged as: \n \n\u201c\u2026firms [in a region] become \u2018embedded\u2019 in\u2026a rich, thick, local-institutional matrix \nthat supports and facilitated the\u2026propagation of new technologies (product and \nprocess).  The ability of firms in such regions to do so is based on shared language, \nculture, norms and conventions, attitudes, values and expectations which generate \ntrust and facilitate the all-important flow of tacit and proprietary knowledge between \nfirms\u201d (Gertler, 2001, 13). \n \nConsequently, as \u201c[t]he inevitable geographical variations in institutionally defined \nlocal context are endemic to organizations\u2026fully \u2018knowing\u2019 what some key \nemployee, situated in a far-flung corner of the corporation, knows will be all but \nimpossible\u201d (Gertler, 2003, 95).  According to Gertler (2004), this is a result of the \nimplementation of best practice and routines developed outside of any one \nregional space being impossible without an understanding of the locally specific \ncultural and institutional norms embodied within the practices 1.  A similar line of \nargument can be found in the work of Whitley (2005) who notes how \u201c[a]s socially \n                                            \n1\n He illustrates this in relation to how machinery designed in Germany cannot be used in Canada \nbecause of the inability of the Canadian buyers to understand German cultural and institutional norms \nin terms of employee training and job tenure.  These are embodied within the machinery\u2019s design and \ntherefore affect the skills needed to use it successfully. \n 9\norganized agents operating in different kinds of societal contexts, firms\u2026are \ninevitably influenced by the dominant norms and conventions governing the \nformation of collective actors\u201d (Whitley, 2005, 190).  This leads to high degrees of \ncomplexity when firms engage in internationalization strategies as \u201cthe growing \ninternationalization of investment and management coordination\u2026can be expected \nto have varied consequences in contrasting institutional environments\u2026the \norganization of most cross-border transactions is likely to remain influenced by \nhome and host economy institutions\u201d (Whitley, 2005, 223, emphasis added).  It \nwould seem misleading, then, to assume that all forms of knowledge management \nin organizations can successfully allow the diffusion of knowledge worldwide.             \nNevertheless, it is also acknowledged by authors such as Gertler and \nWhitley that ignoring the existence of globally stretched knowledge networks in \nfirms is equally misleading.  Wolfe and Gertler (2004, 1086) recently described \nhow \u201cwe have uncovered instances of both local and non-local learning \nrelationships across our range of case studies.  However, one of our most notable \nfindings to date has been that non-local learning relationships appear to be more \nsignificant that the existing literature would have us believe\u201d.  Therefore, building \non the argument reviewed above, they argue that if \u201cinstitutions are the hidden \nglue that holds clusters together, the implicit question is whether the institutional \nstructures relevant to cluster dynamics are exclusively found at the local level\u201d \n(Wolfe and Gertler, 2004, 1079).  It is suggested here, however, that before \nconcerning ourselves with the geography of institutions, it is important to \nacknowledge the affects of different epistemologies of knowledge management \nand learning on the geographies of tacit knowledge, in particular differentiating \nknowledge transfer in the form of best practice (as studied by Gertler, Whitley and \nothers) from the social production of new knowledge where social practice and \ninteraction produces new knowledge (the approach of Amin, Wenger and others).  \nThis is proposed as a way of developing more intricate explanations of the \n 10\nspatiality of knowledge and learning.  Whilst both Gertler (2004) and Whitely \n(2005) are quick to point out that knowledge gets reconstituted when transferred \nacross space, it is argued here that in some cases knowledge management \nattempts not to transfer culturally inflected practices across spaces as a form of \nknowledge, but to foster social practice that develops new knowledge and \nunderstanding2.  The latter form of knowledge management means tacit \nknowledge can be uncoupled from the supposed \u2018local fix\u2019 Gertler and others \ndescribe.  This point is returned to later in the paper.     \n \nEmbedded learning networks \n \nThe importance of understanding the spatial influences upon learning is \nfurther illustrated when we begin to explore the role of socially embedded \nrelationships in knowledge production.  For example, Morgan (2004, 5) draws our \nattention to the well recognised fact that \u201cbody language and face-to-face \ncommunication convey as much as (if not more than) verbal communication\u201d.  \nConsequently, he suggests that uncritical readings of the growing role of globally \nstretched learning networks might \u201cconflate spatial reach with social depth and \n                                            \n2\n For example, reviewing the examples used by Gertler (2003, 91-95) to examine the geographies of \nknowledge reveals an exclusive focus upon processes of knowledge transfer (not the production of \nnew knowledge through social practice).  He refers to: (a) differences in governmental and \norganizational forms \u2013 the \u2018J-form\u2019 in Japan versus Anglo-American firms and the inability to transfer \none form of organizing into another cultural context; (b) the transfer of labour and technology \npractices between manufacturing plants in different countries; and (c) failed attempt to transfer \nknowledge across institutional boundaries within a firm (between and R&D site and headquarters).  In \neach case, whilst knowledge was being reconstituted during the transfer process, Gertler\u2019s focus is \nupon the impediments to deploying knowledges away from their place of production, rather than \nproducing new knowledge through spatially stretched social practice.    \n \n 11\nhence fail to recognize that it is the latter, with its wider scope for social reciprocity, \nwhich is the essential prerequisite for deep [tacit] learning\u201d (Morgan, 2004, 5, \noriginal emphasis).  This reminds us that the trust and mutual understanding, \nproduced through face-to-face encounters, have increasingly been seen as a pre-\nrequisite for learning and that, therefore, analyses cannot simply describe the inert \narchitectures involved in stretched learning but must also get to grips with their \nsocial constitution and, where relevant, the mitigating practices that make up for \nthe loss of embodied interactions (Henry and Pinch, 2000; Storper and Venables, \n2003).  Amin and Cohendet (2004), therefore, argue that more refined theorisation \nof the spatial characteristics of learning and knowledge should be based on a \n\u2018distanciated sociology of learning\u2019 that interrogates the role of relational space.  \nThey highlight how learning \u201cincludes, yes, face-to-face meetings, sociality, and \ncasual contact\u2026but it also draws on distant objects such as drawings faxed \nbetween offices around the world, global travel to form temporary project teams, \nand daily internet\/telephone\/video conversations\u201d (Ibid, 110).  The \u2018networks\u2019 of \nlearning in global organizations should, then, be unpacked as socio-technical \nconstructions, not simply as pipelines for knowledge flows.  \nThe rest of this paper draws on these insights to consider how the \nincreasingly important role of globally stretched learning and knowledge networks \nin organizations can be explained.  It does this through the analysis of empirical \nmaterial collected through 29 interviews with advertising executives working for \nglobal advertising agencies in London and New York3.  Interviewees held a range \nof positions and levels of seniority and represent 11 global agencies.  An interview \nschedule was used that probed the nature of: the architectures of learning that \nenable individuals in different offices to learn from one-another; the problems \n                                            \n3\n Such an approach is well rehearsed within economic geography where studies of PSFs have \nconsistently used case-study based empirical material gleaned from interviews (e.g. Leslie, 1997) \n 12\nassociated with such learning and commonly used solutions.  Interviews were \nconducted in early 2004 and lasted between 35 and 90 minutes.  To maintain the \nanonymity of interviewees the quotes used are anonymous with interviewee \nnumber used for identification purposes.    \n \n3) Geographies of knowledge in PSFs \n \nThe work of all PSFs (advising clients in relation to their business problem or need) \nis only possible when the tacit knowledge of experts is harnessed and exploited \n(Weiss, 1999).  No two projects are identical for these firms with, instead, the \nspecific whims of the client tended to and the nuances of any project central to \ndetermining the nature of the advice provided (Alvesson, 2004).  The key strategic \nchallenge for any PSF is, therefore, to ensure the knowledge needed to produce \ntheir services exists (in the form of skilled employees), is retained (by stopping \nemployees leaving to work for rivals) and is leveraged (through knowledge \nmanagement) (Lowendahl, 2000).  At the same time, these firms also \u2018lubricate\u2019 \nthe process of globalisation through the creation of global PSF networks that aim \nto provide integrated and seamless services through the \u2018development and \ndiffusion worldwide\u2019 of knowledge.  As Lowendahl (2000, 152-153) comments: \n \n\u201c\u2026global presence may enable the firm to develop broader \u2018experience records\u2019 \nand shared knowledge, because of the access to a broader set of knowledge \ndevelopment sources\u2026In PSFs the competitive advantage, if achieved, results \nfrom the ability of the firm to continuously tap into the knowledge developed in all \nrelevant centres of the world\u2026You may even gain competitive advantage from \nbeing located in a place where the market is not profitable at all, if the learning from \nthese projects adds more value to other markets\u201d. \n \n                                                                                                                         \n \n 13\nTable 2 highlights how global knowledge leverage is increasingly possible for \nglobal advertising PSFs through their ever-growing number of offices worldwide.  It \nalso draws our attention to the role of the global media groups these agencies are \npart of4.  In the most important advertising market - the USA - the five leading \ngroups (Havas, Interpublic, Omnicom, Publicis and WPP) received three quarters \nof advertising spending (Advertising Age, 2003).  A specific mandate of both \nagencies and groups is to engage in successful knowledge management.  One \ngroup (WPP) suggests that \u201cacross the group there are knowledge communities \nworking in particular sectors or with particular skills which share non-confidential \ninsights, case studies and best practice\u201d (WPP, 2005).  Similarly, Young and \nRubicam argue: \n\u201cFor us, globalization has to mean more than dots on the map.  We believe that real \nglobal reach means making real connections \u2013 or paying the price for not doing so.  \nThe language of brands is becoming universal.  So the ability to transfer knowledge \nand experience from one part of the globe to another is not just about efficiency, it\u2019s \nexponentially more powerful\u201d (Young and Rubicam, 2003). \n \nHowever, despite this rhetoric, advertising knowledge could be seen as \narchetypically \u2018local\u2019 in nature.  As Daniels (1995, 283) notes in relation to global \nadvertising agencies, it is the \u201c[n]etworks [which] are the most effective way to \nservice clients which have globalised product development but still sell locally, and \n                                            \n4\n The leading groups emerged between predominantly in the 1980\u2019s.  Interpublic was the forerunner \nof this model (born in 1961) whilst others followed as globalization presented new challenges: Havas \nin 1975; Publicis in 1984; WPP in 1985 and Omnicom in 1986. This industry structure of \u2018global \ngroups\u2019 with several agencies within them was, in particular, a response to the restrictions newly \nglobalizing agencies faced when serving firms that were rivals in the same industry.  The structure \nallowed one group to serve rival firms but through separate agencies, thus avoiding conflicts of \ninterest and widening potential client and profit bases.   \n 14\ntherefore need local advertising\u2026 As long as this is true it will be necessary to \nhave agency networks (Daniels, 1995, 283).  The direct \u2018transferability\u2019 of \nadvertising knowledge could then, drawing on Gertler\u2019s (2001; 2004) terminology, \nbe described as \u2018culturally and institutionally embedded\u2019 at the point of production \nbecause of local market nuances and reflexive customers (Lash and Urry, 1994).  \nOn top of this, two other factors give the work of advertising agencies an \napparently \u2018local\u2019 nature:        \n \n\u2022 The need for face-to-face contact and trust rich relationships.  Advertising \nagencies principally deliver their services to the marketing managers of the \nworld\u2019s largest TNCs through trust-based, face-to-face relationships \n(Halinen, 1991); \n \n\u2022 The importance of \u2018local, regional\u2019 spaces of advertising knowledge \nproduction in city-based clusters (e.g. Leslie, 1997; Faulconbridge, \nforthcoming).   \n \n[Insert table 2 here] \n \nNevertheless, it has been noted that global advertising agencies are linked \ninto important global knowledge networks.  Grabher (2002) provides an exemplary \nexamination of such stretched learning by unpacking the way advertising agencies \noperating in London benefit from what he describes as an \u2018heterarchy\u2019 that \nfacilitates learning both from physically proximate rivals and distanciated overseas \ncolleagues based on shared areas of interest, competitive flair and ideals.  More \nrecently (Grabher, 2004) he describes how project ecologies allow advertising \nexecutives to benefit from being part of \u2018epistemic collectives\u2019 \u2013 groups of \nindividuals working for the same firm (but not necessarily in the same office) that \n 15\ninteract and develop novel advertising approaches.  We can further delve into the \nnature of this process through the work of Perry (1990, 42) who notes the \nimportant role of \u2018globally aligned advertising accounts\u2019 for corporations such as \nExxon or Coca Cola.  These are based upon \u201cthe transfer of successful marketing \nstrategies between locations\u201d.  However, \u201c[a]n aligned account does not means the \nsame campaign is replicated in every location or even more than one geographical \nregion\u201d.  Instead, in the vast majority of cases market-specific advertising that \ndraws on the knowledge and ideas of advertising executives from throughout the \nfirm is produced.  This is not to say globally uniform campaigns do not exist or that \nthe transfer of best practice between offices does not occur.  Rather, it begins to \ntease out the complex interweaving of different knowledge management practices \nin the global networks of advertising PSFs.   \nBelow, the way global advertising agencies engage in the \u2018development \nand diffusion worldwide\u2019 of knowledge is further explored through an instructive \nempirical case study.  This deepens our understanding of the practice of globally \nstretched learning in advertising agencies by highlighting and differentiating the \nuse of both best practice transfer and the social production of new knowledge in \nthe designing of locally tailored campaigns.  In particular, it shows that whilst \ncultural and institutional embeddedness of knowledge is important, it is not always \nan impediment to globally stretched learning.            \n   \n \n4) Global \u2018social\u2019 learning in PSFs \nTo unpack the nature of globally stretched learning in advertising PSFs it is \nimportant to develop the epistemological distinction noted previously between \n\u2018knowledge transfer\u2019 (Gertler, 2003; Whitley, 2005) and what is referred to here as \nthe social production of knowledge\u2019 (c.f Amin and Cohendet, 2004).  Whilst both of \nthese practices are relevant in advertising PSFs, best practice transfer often (but \n 16\nnot always) relates to agency \u2018management\u2019 rather than advertising campaign \nproduction.  The growing need for locally tailored advertising that responds to \nreflexive and differentiated consumers (Lash and Urry, 1994) increasingly means \nthat, in relation to knowledge for advertising campaigns, \u201c[t]he flows are not of \nproducts but of people and of ideas\u201d (Rubalcaba-Bermejo and Cuadrado-Roura, \n2002, 42).  This means ensuring practices are in place to allow ideas and insights \nto be shared that can be learned from and built upon by individuals in the \norganisation so as to inform the future thinking of advertising executives.   \nSeveral scholars have pointed to the importance of differentiating between \ntransfers of knowledge and globally stretched social learning.  Amin and \nCohendet (2004, 8) suggest focus should be placed on \u201cknowledge as a process \nand practice, rather than a possession, on the pragmatics of everyday learning in \nsituated contexts\u201d.  This builds upon the work of Cook and Brown (1999) and \nrecognises the importance of a \u2018generative dance of knowledge production\u2019, an \nidea described well by how they discuss the value of conversation for learning: \n \n\u201cWhen Emma says to Andrew \u2018I\u2019ve been doing it this way\u2019, Andrew not only adds \nthat knowledge to his own experiences, skills and sensitivities, and the like (and \nvice versa when Andrew makes his reply).  By placing Emma\u2019s knowledge into \nAndrew\u2019s contexts, the conversation can evoke novel associations, connections, \nand hunches \u2013 it can generate new insights and new meaning\u2026In this way, \nconversation affords more than an exchange in which the net sum of knowledge \nremains the same; it dynamically affords a generative dance within which the \ncreation of new knowledge and new ways of using knowledge is possible\u201d (page \n393, original emphasis). \n \nAndrew benefits because of the new understanding that emerges as he interprets \nthe ideas of Emma.  This reflects a growing body of work that recognises that \n 17\n\u201cthere may be value in a perspective that\u2026focuses on the knowledgeability of \naction, this is on knowing (a verb connoting action, doing, practice) rather than \nknowledge (a noun connoting things, elements, facts, processes, descriptions)\u201d \n(Orlikowski, 2002, 250, original emphasis).  Under this rubric, the idea that \nknowledge \u201cincreases with use\u201d emerges \u2013 the idea that an individual\u2019s knowledge \nand understanding is enriched when involved in social practices that allow \ncognition to be influenced and shaped (Davenport and Prusak, 1998, 17).   \n   By recognising the importance of such \u2018social production of knowledge\u2019, it is \npossible to remove the problem of knowledge and best practice being culturally \nand institutionally embedded.  Gertler (2004) acknowledges that all knowledge \nforms are dynamic and reconstituted when applied away from their place of origin.  \nHowever, the social production of knowledge as a practice is not about adapting \nexisting practices to suit local conditions, but using social interaction to inform \nunderstanding and develop new logics.  As Alvesson (2004) notes in relation to \nPSFs, ambiguity dominates the type of knowledge that informs the production of \nservices where \u201cambiguity means that a group of informed people are likely to hold \nmultiple meanings or that several plausible interpretations can be made\u201d.  \nConsequently, it is necessary to ensure individuals have the ability to develop their \nthinking and interpretations (their knowledge) so that their understanding of such \nambiguous issues is, whilst never right or wrong, likely to allow them to provide \nsuccessful advice to clients5.  The aim of PSFs is, then, to put the conditions in \n                                            \n5\n Alvesson (2004, 176-177) describes how knowledge management strategies in PSFs are normally \nconceptualised as being based on: (a) codification where knowledge is stored in databases (e.g. as a \nbest practice) and exploited through economies of reuse that do not result in the development of new \nideas; or (b) personalization where social interaction is encouraged to develop new understanding \nand solutions.  Typically an 80-20 split is used, normally in favour of personalization because of the \n\u2018ambiguity\u2019 of the issues addressed.   \n 18\nplace where the social production of new knowledge is possible, whilst not ignoring \nthe complementary role of \u2018best practice transfer\u2019.    \n \nPractices of learning in PSFs  \n \nIn the advertising agencies studied the complementary yet differentiated \nnature of knowledge leverage by transfer and the social production of new \nknowledge was clearly exemplified.  All agencies, despite its recognised \nlimitations, used the \u2018global advert\u2019 approach.  This was usually in response to \nrequests by the client to exploit the economies of scale such adverts offer.  \nHowever, for all interviewees this was not the preferred way of producing adverts.  \nAs one interviewee described the inherent problems with such a global transfer \napproach:  \n \n\u201cWith [client y] it [the lead office] was in New York.  And local offices had ideas \nabout how the advertising should look and feel and were saying that doesn\u2019t feel \nright for our market.  However, the power was really in New York and the response \nwas \u2018well no actually, we\u2019ve got global mandate and you\u2019ll have to do it like this\u2019.  I \nthought that in that particular instance rolling out the brand across markets might \nmake sense financially but in terms of local cultural sensitivity it was totally wrong \nand probably left consumers in some countries totally mystified about what the \nadvert was trying to say about the product\u201d (A17).   \n  \nThis shows the perils of knowledge transfer in terms of the potential cultural and \ninstitutional fixity of advertising knowledges.  Consequently, interviewees \nunanimously agreed that global knowledge management\/leverage that focuses \nupon the social production of new knowledge is preferable.  This is in large part \nbased upon telephone-mediated conversations that allow fellow professionals \n 19\nlocated throughout the world to exchange ideas, insights and experiences and \nlearn from one-another.  As one advertiser argued, \u201cit\u2019s not an exact science \nwhere you can go away and say \u2018this is the right answer\u2019 - because there isn\u2019t \nnecessarily a right answer and there certainly isn\u2019t a right answer that fits all \ncountries \u2013 so rather than ask people for the answer you listen to their ideas which \nthen shapes your thinking.  So the ability to compare and talk about it is what\u2019s \nessential\u201d (A13). \nInterviewees suggested they engaged in such \u2018learning\u2019 conversations with \noverseas colleagues several times a day with the knowledge produced used to \ndevelop innovative and tailored solutions to clients\u2019 problems6.  A number of \nexamples of when such learning occurred can be extracted from the interview \ndata, principally in relation to knowledge about the content of an advert.  First, \naccount planners and managers often gained insights into strategic ploys that can \nbe used in a campaign and the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches.  \nAs one account planner described such an advantage: \n \n\u201c\u2026for example we\u2019ve just done a thing for a financial services client and we sent \nout a thing asking people to tell us what was the most interesting [strategy] \ninnovation they\u2019ve used for banking in their market\u2026so you build up a body of \nknowledge on a type of business and share that with colleagues, you share your \ninsights with them and they return the favour\u2026There is a cross fertilisation of ideas \nacross the different cultural boundaries that is vital which means not replicating \nwhat they did but learning from it, using it as a spur for innovation\u201d (A12). \n \n                                            \n6\n These principally occurred between advertising executives in London and New York as well as \nbetween advertising executives in London, New York and other offices in Western Europe, South \nEast Asia and Australia.   \n 20\nSecondly, both planners and creatives (although see the caveat in appendix 1 \nabout creatives) can have their \u2018blue skies\u2019, innovative and creative thinking guided \nby insights from conversations with overseas colleagues.  As one creative noted: \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I approach these things thinking I\u2019ll get their experience.  It\u2019s \nnormally that there is a grain of an idea that you can embellish, develop, and its not \nthat I go to them thinking, lets get his experience, but its more, I wonder what he \nwill say about this new situation.  And that is based on his experience but what is \ninteresting to me is the new thing\u2026 I guess the point is that the encounter between \nthe experience thing and the new situation can only happen in one person\u2019s \nhead\u2026 it has to happen in your head.  So you give them an issue and they react \nwith whatever they come up with in their head, a thought, and that helps develop \nyour thoughts.  So, for example, when I was trying to come up with a way to sell \n[food product x] I phoned several of my colleagues and talked about what they\u2019d \ndone in the past on similar projects or with similar problems and why they did that \nand what sort of things they thought my work.  And I came up with an idea none of \nthem mentioned, but I\u2019m sure they triggered the thought and influenced my \nthinking\u201d (A16). \n \nAll of the advertising executives quoted above were well aware of the cultural \ndifferences that exist between advertising markets.  However, they were also \naware that sharing insights and ideas was valuable when individuals learn from \nconversations and do not try to replicate an approach in London or New York that \nmight be successful, for example in Germany.  The key to success was the ability \nto gain stimulus and ideas from colleagues that could inform thinking and feed into \nsense making.  As one advertising executives suggested, \u201c\u2026in a discussion which \nsay might be with you French colleagues and how French woman\u2019s attitudes to \n[product x] are different to British woman\u2019s and that is incredibly productive.  And \nwith my American partners we talk about new design evolution in the business, \n 21\ncampaigns we\u2019ve done so I\u2019m always talking to someone elsewhere in the world \nand benefiting from it.  But what I do is learn from it, feed it into my judgement I \nsuppose.  I wouldn\u2019t try to copy it, that just doesn\u2019t work\u201d (A22).  Another described \na similar process: \n \n\u201cI got a report written by this guy in Belgium, and I think we were doing some work \non kids for [client x\u2019s] children\u2019s wear.  But that didn\u2019t really help me much.  What \ndid help was when I spoke to him on the phone, and he filled me in on the real \ncontext, the insights.  And I couldn\u2019t replicate what he did in Belgium, consumers \ndon\u2019t relate to clothes in the same way.  But it did give me some ideas and it \ntriggered my thinking about a certain way to develop the brand\u201d (A11). \n \nThere is, then, a fundamental difference between this type of \u2018social\u2019 \nlearning and practices of knowledge transfer.  The description of \u2018best practice \ntransfer\u2019 attended to by some examinations of the geographies of learning (e.g. \nGertler, 2004; Whitely, 2005) focuses upon what Bartlett and Ghoshal (1998) \nwould call an international strategy (where best practice from one part of the \norganisation is implemented in another) whereas in the \u2018social learning\u2019 described \nabove a transnational approach is used (everyone learns from one-another).  It is \nargued here that recognising this difference between the transfer of best practices \nand the global stretching of the \u2018social production of knowledge\u2019 can be used to \nunderstand how knowledge and learning can, in many cases, have global \ngeographies that are less impeded by the cultural and institutional embeddedness \nof economic practice7.       \nBelow, the empirical findings from this research are used to further develop \nthis argument and unpack the way globally stretched social learning is used in \n                                            \n7\n Gertler (2004, 141) acknowledges that an alternative epistemology of learning to the transfer-based \nmodel exists and should be explored to further develop understanding of the geography of learning \nand knowledge.   \n 22\nadvertising PSF as a strategy for knowledge leverage.  This again highlights how \nthe knowledge informing adverts themselves is predominantly leveraged through a \nprocess of social learning.  This relies on the existence and management of \npractice-based and relational spaces of learning that provide both the \u2018cognitive\u2019 \nand \u2018social\u2019 contexts for learning.   \n \n \n5) Global practice-based spaces of learning \nThis section of the paper begins to unpack the mechanics of globally \nstretched learning in advertising PSFs.  The global stretching of knowledge relating \nto an advertising campaign is possible because of the macro-level similarities in \nadvertising executives\u2019 work throughout the world.  This means that, although there \nis the need for the local tailoring of adverts, it is possible to identify globally \nstandard approaches and elements of advertising strategy that can form the basis \nof the conversations involved in the social production of new knowledge.  As one \ninterviewee commented, \u201cIts very easy to get on with people, very easy to share \nstuff.  Although there tends to be quite fundamental differences between markets\u2019 \nrelationships with a brand or product there are useful approaches to a certain \nextent that are shared and can be used to target consumers anywhere in the \nworld\u201d (A8).  Another noted that: \n   \n\u201cWe all watch the same TV programmes, face common issues in our day-to-day \nlives, have similar ideas.  Now there are idiosyncrasies, but the basic processes \nare the same everywhere and you talk about those\u201d (A10).           \n \nThis idea is reinforced by research commissioned by Young and Rubicam entitled \n\u2018There are seven kinds of people in the world\u2019 (Young and Rubicam, 2004).  This is \nused as both a promotional tool to suggest that the firm can produce advertising to \n 23\ninfluence audiences in any part of the world, simply by understanding which of the \nseven categories they fit within, and also acts as a valuable form of best practice, \nencouraging employees to analyse the consumers they target using pre-defined \napproaches and categories8.  Most significantly here, it shows how advertisers \noften use the same generic strategies and approaches regardless of the product or \nmarket for which the advert is being developed.  This does not deny that there are \n\u2018locally-specific\u2019 influences on any consumer\u2019s behaviour, but instead \nacknowledges that practices and approaches for creating feelings of empathy, \nsorrow, desire or lust, for example, have global commonality.  Advertising \nexecutives from all of the agencies studied suggested their main aim was to learn \nfrom overseas colleagues about such shared challenges and approaches to \nadvertising and to use the insights gained from conversations to guide sense-\nmaking and thinking.   \nSuch learning is facilitated by what is termed here a \u2018global practice-\nbased space\u2019 of learning.  When the \u2018social production of new knowledge\u2019 is \ntaking place focus falls on exchanging insights into globally common practices \nsuch as \u2018how to inspire feelings of desire towards a product\u2019 or \u2018how to revitalise \nthe image of a product that is viewed by consumers as old fashioned\u2019, rather than \nregion-specific or ambiguous discussion of, for example, how advertising for \nshower gel works.  As two interviewees further described the characteristics of \nsuch a shared space for learning: \n \n\u201cI think one has to be careful when one talks about ideas.  If you start by talking \nabout a strategic idea, an insight, then it is not too problematic.  And today we are \n                                            \n8\n Indeed, the importance of global best practice should not be underplayed.  In the agencies and \ngroups studied standard global approaches were used for a range of business management activities \nincluding: client procurement and relationship management; expenses and financial management; \nagency budgeting; and, human resources.  \n 24\nvery fortunate in that the English language has become so prevalent, even \nlanguage issues seem to have gone away.  But at the strategic insight driven level \nthere are not too many problems of core insights crossing borders.  However, \nwhen you get creative executions, that\u2019s when you begin to see national \ndifferences really coming to the fore\u201d (A21). \n \n\u201c\u2026it's amazing, there is a very common language and thought process \u2026 I think it \nhas to do with the fact that there are some basics associated with how you arrive at \na strategy that are the same no matter where you are and what you\u2019re doing\u2026So \nthere\u2019s a common language, a common view, there are some questions and \nanswers that typically happen pretty much regardless of where you are in the \nworld\u201d (A25).       \n \nThe first quote highlights that, whilst the execution of adverts is affected by \nlocal cultural specificity, the strategies, practices and approaches associated with \nthe main advertising challenges have a high degree of global commonality.  An \nadvertising executive in London might discuss with a colleague in France how they \ninspired feelings of cleanliness in an advert for shower gel.  This then influences \ntheir thinking and sense making and, in the future, guides the way they develop an \nimage of cleanliness to sell domestic cleaning products in the UK.  This involves, \nthen, not reproducing or even adapting the strategies used in France but, instead, \nusing the knowing and understanding developed and influenced by the \nconversation to help deal with the ambiguity of creating feelings of cleanliness.  \nFurther examples of the type of learning facilitated by practice-based spaces are \noutlined in table 3.   \n \n[Insert table 3 here] \n \n \n 25\nManaging practice-based spaces \n \nThe value of such \u2018shared spaces\u2019 only truly emerges when they are \nexploited and configured by global organisations and, where necessary, \nconstructed through \u2018network management strategies\u2019 (Gupta and Govindarajan, \n2001; Jones, 2005).  Firms exploit practice-based spaces through strategies that \naim to draw the attention of all employees to the importance of sharing insights \nwith overseas colleagues.  As one interviewee who held a senior management \nposition commented, \u201c\u2026where there is an issue then any account team worth their \nsalt will trawl and bring in a relatively big cross sample from across the agency.  \nAnd its our policy that on any project the team members must consult with their \ncolleagues both in this office but also worldwide to find out what they can learn \nfrom them\u201d (A21).  Whilst not all agencies had such a clear \u2018exploitation\u2019 policy, it \nwas generally recognised by interviewees that engaging in a global consultation \nprocess was valuable, normally through a network of inter-personal relationships \nwith overseas colleagues.   \nThe use of practice group formations is equally valuable and helps \nconfigure practice-based spaces.  In global advertising PSFs it is common to \ngroup employees into global practice groups based on their job role.  For example, \nin two of the agencies studied global planning practice-groups existed that bought \ntogether individuals with a shared interest in the problems attached to account \nplanning.  This effectively created a \u2018constellation of practice\u2019; the global \ncommunity that allows globally stretched learning.  As one member of a practice \ngroup commented:          \n \n\u201cThere\u2019s an international planning group called [group x] that try to help each other \nout with case studies and ideas when we\u2019re doing something and that becomes \nvery useful because you get different perspectives\u2026it\u2019s really useful to know who\u2019s \n 26\ndoing the same thing as you but say in London and [group x] brings us all together \nso we can feed each others experiences into our thinking about the way we \napproach a project\u201d (A29). \n \nIn addition, advertising PSFs also found it important to construct practice-\nbased spaces to further enhance the global stretching of learning.  This is a good \nexample of how the transfer and \u2018social production\u2019 of knowledge can be \nsynergistic.  To construct practice-based spaces seven of the eleven advertising \nagencies studied had some form of global communication and branding model \n(what they often refer to as a tool).  This is used to help share ideas and strategies \nbetween offices and is, in effect, a form of best practice transferred to all offices \nfrom headquarters.  Table 3 gives two examples of such corporate models\/tools \nand how the agencies describe them.  Each is based around a number of \n\u2018modules\u2019 or \u2018components\u2019 that have a corporate language associated with them.  \nThese describe processes and strategies for dealing with the common issues in \nany advertising campaign.  To maintain the anonymity of interviewees the firm-\nspecific languages are not reproduced here.  However, a hypothetical example that \nrenames a number of the phases can be given.  So for example,  a module \ncovering issues associated with the initial phases of a project named \u2018first day\u2019 \nmight detail the challenges associated with moving a client\u2019s aims for a campaign \ntowards a number of potential lines of strategy that target certain consumer \ngroups.  A component called \u2018solidification\u2019 within this might detail how strategies \ncan be translated into several ideas for the types of place, cast and story-line in the \nadvert.  Advertising executives throughout the world are familiar with and can learn \nfrom one-another about the difficulties of \u2018first day\u2019, the best way to apply \n\u2018solidification\u2019 and the globally common techniques and procedures used to help \ndeal with these challenges.  The following comment from an advertiser further \nhighlights this point:  \n 27\n     \n \n[Insert table 4 here] \n \n \n\u201cI can get a call from the Middle East and they\u2019ll say to me \u2018we\u2019re doing a [activity x] \nand we\u2019re doing this and I know immediately what a [activity x] is and what they\u2019re \ngoing through, what they need.  And so there are processes in place that make it \neasier and they make it easier to get on the same wavelength.  That process is an \nimportant way to make sure that every office in the network has a basic way of \nunderstanding basic things\u201d (A2).  \n \nAs this quote shows, advertising executives value such tools that are, in effect, \nforms of best practice, because of how they make misunderstanding and confusion \nless of a problem when engaging in knowledge leverage through the social \nproduction of new knowledge.  This is possible because of the stable, \u2018artificial\u2019, \n\u2018practice-based spaces\u2019 of learning constructed.  Having such shared \nunderstanding is vital and brings us back to the first quotes used in this section of \nthe paper.  These highlighted the role of shared understanding, actions and \npractice in facilitating learning, and the \u2018corporate tools\u2019 described here provide an \nadditional way to develop such cognitive convergence.  As one interviewee \ncommented: \n\u201c\u2026ideas are really difficult things for people to understand\u2026And [corporate tool x] \nis just a really good global tool and what\u2019s cool about it is that the methodology is \ndone in such a way that you could compare any brand to any brand anywhere and \nyou can compare brands by country so its an incredibly flexible tool and you can \nusually pull a story out.  And it can be hard for me to understand where a brand is \nin any other country\u2019s brandscape, but [corporate tool x] is a really good way of me \ngetting a grip on that, brilliant at helping you understand\u2026It doesn\u2019t help us \n 28\ndevelop the strategy but it helps us share it, if you like it\u2019s a common language that \nyou can use between offices\u201d (A11). \n      \nThis highlights, then, the complimentary role of best practice transfer and \nthe social production of new knowledge in organizations.  Of course, the \nexploitation, configuration and construction of practice base spaces is not as \nstraight forward as conveyed in this brief description.  Appendix 1 therefore fleshes \nout in more detail the complexity of this process and some important caveats to \nthis argument.    \n \n6) Global relational spaces of learning \nIn addition to managing \u2018practice-based spaces\u2019, it also emerged that the \nglobal organisations studied were effective at managing the global \u2018learning \nnetworks\u2019 needed for global knowledge leverage.  As a range of scholars have \nnoted (Amin and Cohendet, 1999; Dicken, 2000), the globalisation of economic \nactivities has resulted in firms that operate as complex socio-spatial networks.  For \nexample, various forms of transnational community have been shown to allow the \nglobal stretching of learning because of the reciprocity, mutual understanding and \ntrust that emerges (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Bunnel and Coe, 2001; Gupta and \nGovindarajan, 2001).  Orlikowski (2002, 255) provides an instructive empirical \nexample of the way management in a global software company implemented \nvarious strategies to ensure employees \u201cconstitute a sense of knowing their \ncolleagues, of knowing their credibility in and commitment to specific issues, and of \nknowing how to collaborate with them\u2026in a globally dispersed and complex \nproduct development environment\u201d.  This involved both virtual and occasional face-\nto-face contact, something that emerged as critical in the advertising PSFs studied \nhere.    \n 29\nThe importance of \u2018socially embedded\u2019 relationships for learning has been \nmade clear by geographers (Storper and Venables, 2003; Morgan, 2004) and, for \ninterviewees, \u2018embedded\u2019 global relationships facilitated the global stretching of the \nsocial production of new knowledge when coupled with the practice-based spaces \ndescribed above.  In particular, interviewees described the value of having a \nnumber of what were commonly described as \u2018close contacts\u2019 or \u2018trusted \ncolleagues\u2019 working in overseas offices.  As one interviewee put it:   \n\u201c\u2026to give you an example of [client x], there is a global account planner based on \nNew York and he\u2019s a chap I\u2019ve worked with before, and I\u2019m quite happy to call him \nand had it been a different person who I didn\u2019t know I might not have been as \nready to do that\u2026. depending on the people, I was quite happy to talk to [person x] \nbecause it was [person x] and I know him, you feel less exposed.  If it had not been \nhim I\u2019d have been less willing to enter in to a discussion\u2026you trust them and feel, \ndon\u2019t take this the wrong way, able to expose yourself to them!\u201d (16). \n \nThis quote exemplifies, then, the value of having \u2018embedded\u2019 relationships \nwith colleagues and the way trust, mutual understanding and well nurtured \nfriendships smooth conversations involved in producing knowledge.  This ensures \nall involved feel able to openly and honestly express ideas and beliefs whilst, at the \nsame time, trusting and believing the ideas expressed by others.  Establishing and \nsustaining such relationships with overseas colleagues creates what is referred to \nhere as a global relational space.  Table 4 further outlines the benefits of such a \n\u2018shared space\u2019.  These relational spaces are, however, like practice-based spaces, \nin part at least the result of the network management strategies of global \nadvertising PSFs and the groups they are a part of.  \n \n[Insert table 5 here] \n \n 30\nManaging relational spaces \n \nFor advertising executives, global relational spaces are constructed and \nconfigured in two ways.  First, within advertising PSFs a significant proportion of \nwork has a global dimension.  The clients of these firms are some of the world\u2019s \nlargest TNC\u2019s (table 2) and the most profitable projects involve producing \nadvertising for several world markets.  As has been noted by others (e.g. Grabher, \n2002), advertising agencies use project team architectures which involve creating \na team of individuals in offices throughout the World dedicated to meeting the \nneeds of a single client.  Consequently, a number of global professional network \nrelationships are configured between counterparts on a project in several offices.  \nIndividuals talk to overseas team members on a regular basis by telephone (often \ndaily or at minimum once a week) and discuss problems and exchange ideas \nabout potential solutions.  In doing this a rapport and collegiality begins to develop \nbetween individuals in different offices, something that begins to foster reciprocity \nand trust.  The comments of one interviewee described this idea well:    \n \n\u201cIf you work on a global account you have a network of people and you get to know \nthem.  Once a week you have a conference call, what\u2019s going on.  You\u2019d e-mail out \nevery week so people knew what you were doing.  And its up to the guy running \nthe account globally to make sure those contacts work and that people are talking, \npreferably every day, getting to know each other, developing the friendships that \nmake things work\u201d (A6). \n \nKey to this configuration process is the role of management in global PSFs \nwho are able to \u2018network\u2019 individuals and create \u2018social capital\u2019 (Gupta and \nGovindarajan, 2001).  As one director commented about his role, \u201cI\u2019m always \nsaying to those guys out there, pick up the phone and talk to Germany, to Holland, \n 31\nall the time. They\u2019re on the phone all the time and I stress that they need to \ndevelop a rapport and good working relationship\u201d (A18).  In addition, the \nmanagement of the careers of advertising executives also helped construct \nrelational networks.  As one senior account director describes, moving individuals \nbetween teams on a regular basis is essential for developing relational spaces and \nnetworks, \u201c\u2026the more years you have in the business the more brands you work \non and you kind of build up a portfolio of relationships.  That\u2019s why we encourage \npeople to work on several different accounts and so in my 10 years of account \nmanagement I probably worked on 25, 30 different brands and you build up a real \nnetwork that way by meeting and working with people all over the World\u201d (A13). \n      \nThe processes described above configure relationships \u2013 develop \u2018know-\nwho\u2019 (Grabher, 2002).  In addition, the managed global mobility of employees in \nPSFs and the occasional face-to-face contact facilitated by business travel also \nhelps construct the relationships through which globally stretched learning occurs.  \nSuch mobility further nurtures and reinforces the trust, reciprocity and mutual \nunderstanding that already exists in relationships formed through virtual means.  \nThis business travel principally involved flows of individuals between the London \nand New York offices themselves and also between the two cities and Western \nEuropean (Milan, Munich, Paris), and East Asian (Hong Kong and Tokyo) offices. \nVisits normally last between three days and four weeks and are first and foremost \norganised so individuals can attend formal events such as project meetings or \npractice group conferences.  However, all interviewees agreed that it is the social \nevents organised afterwards and the opportunity they provide to spend time with \noverseas colleagues in a social setting, playing golf, eating a meal and often most \nimportantly getting drunk, which allows relationships to be \u2018strengthened.  As one \ninterviewee described the value of such encounters, \u201cThere are formal comings \ntogether, there\u2019s a global conference coming next month where literally \n 32\nrepresentatives from all the worldwide offices will be there.  There\u2019s presentations \nabout the business but there is a social side to that so that we are gelling as a \nnetwork rather than just being pins in the map\u201d (A5).  Another noted that: \n \n\u201c\u2026you tend to have a person who you rely on in that office and you do build a \nrelationship with that person and quite often it will take a while and then you\u2019ll meet \n[face-to-face].  So you get to know that person and its really important to meet \nthem because you always have an easier phone relationship once you\u2019ve met \nface-to-face and you have a better sense of them\u2026And I guess the people I get on \nwith best are those I\u2019ve spent time with, enjoyed a night out with\u201d (A8). \n \nAs these quotes suggest, the face-to-face encounters facilitated by global mobility \nbuild on the pre-existing foundations of friendships formed through telephone-\nmediated interactions.  This leads to the type of trust-based relationships that are \nvital for learning.  Such an argument is confirmed by the comments of an \ninterviewee who was new to the firm they worked at, having arrived within two \nmonths of being interviewed.  He\/she noted that \u201cit\u2019s really difficult at the moment \nbecause I don\u2019t know anyone apart from by their name on a list.  So my suggestion \nto my boss was that we get them over here to help us so I can meet them and get \nto know them\u201d (A28).  Similarly, another interviewee who worked for a firm that had \nrecently merged with a rival described the difficulties of having to establish new \nglobal professional networks but also \u2018nurture\u2019 them.  As he\/she suggested, \n\u201d\u2026because we only merged [x time] ago I don\u2019t have a network of contacts.  But \nthat would be the idea, to have colleagues in a number offices you can rely on.  \nThere\u2019s an emerging degree of integration but its still got quite a way to go but its \ngetting better as we work on these global accounts and come in to contact with \none-another\u201d (A14).  Again, there are numerous caveats to the argument made \n 33\nabout the existence and development of relational spaces.  These are again \nexplored in more detail in appendix 1.   \n \n7) Discussion and conclusions \n  The empirical research findings detailed here extend our understanding of \nthe nature of globally stretched learning and suggest that when the geographies of \nthe \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 (Department for Trade and Industry, 1998) are discussed \nthere is a need to recognise both the cultural and institutional influences on \nknowledge and economic practice (e.g. Gertler, 2003; Morgan, 2004) yet also the \npotential for successful \u2018knowledge development and diffusion worldwide\u2019 by global \nfirms when certain forms of knowledge leverage are practised (Amin and \nCohendet, 2004; Bartlett and Ghoshal, 1998).  The paper begins to address this \nissue and acknowledges the multiple geographies and practices of learning \nthat exist in global organizations (Allen, 2000).  Two significant contributions have \nbeen made that help in this task.   \nFirst, the empirical material has been used to show that two different \nepistemologies of learning and practices of knowledge leverage exist and are used \nin global advertising PSFs.  The global transfer of knowledge operates as a way of \ncirculating knowledge in the reproducible form of best practice (Gertler, 2001; \n2003; 2004; Whitley, 2005).  As has been previously suggested, this suffers, \nhowever, from difficulties associated with the implementation of culturally and \ninstitutionally sticky best practices outside of their place of production.  \nConsequently, in advertising PSFs the most successful knowledge transfer relates \nto management practices not advertising knowledges.  Instead, the social \nproduction of new knowledge allows the development of new advertising ideas and \nknowledges through social practice (Amin and Cohendet, 2004; Wenger, 1998), \nhelping overcome the difficulties created by spatially variegated and ambiguous \nadvertising practices and markets as the aim is not to replicate approaches \n 34\nelsewhere but to allow individuals to learn from others\u2019 ideas and experiences \n(Alvesson, 2004; Perry, 1990).  Acknowledging these different approaches to \nknowledge leverage in global firms is suggested to be a fruitful way to build on the \ncomplementary and insightful work of economic geographers in relation to the \nspatiality of knowledge and learning. \nThe paper secondly shows that the \u2018network management strategies\u2019 used \nby global PSFs to exploit, configure and construct global practice-based and \nrelational spaces of learning are central to the success of the global production of \nnew knowledge through social practice.  As a result, both the \u2018cognitive\u2019 (practice \nbased) spaces and the \u2018social\u2019 (relational) spaces needed for learning were \nmanaged within the firms studied.  The emergence of these spaces creates \ncommunities or constellations of learning that stretch beyond scale-defined \nboundaries, in particular highlighting how the development of trust, respect and \nmutual understanding is not a process that can be delimited to the local scale nor \nassociated with relationships based exclusively on face-to-face interaction.       \nRecognition of these different epistemologies and the practices of learning \nand knowledge leverage associated with them might enable economic \ngeographers to further develop their contributions to debates on organizational \nlearning through intricate theorisations of the spatiality of learning and knowledge.  \nThis means recognising that there are multiple geographies and practices of \nlearning that play out in diverging ways, bolstering the argument that there is a \nneed to decouple tacit knowledge from the local scale but also highlighting the \nneed to be sensitive to different knowledge management practices and their \ndifferent spatial reaches.  Therefore, as has been identified in this paper, a \nrelational analysis that traces the networks of learning involved in organizational \nknowledge management strategies and their socio-spatial constitution would seem \nvaluable in producing more refined and spatially sensitive analyses.   \n \n 35\nAppendix 1 \nWhilst the majority of interviewees were clear that the practice-based spaces \ndescribed allowed the sharing of insights and ideas between professionals working in the \nadvertising industry, a minority were less sure about their value.  Of the 29 advertising \nexecutives interviewed, six expressed some uncertainty about their ability to learn from \noverseas colleagues, five of these being creatives.  Creatives were, in particular, \nconcerned that it was hard to understand the use of a creative strategy in another country \nand, therefore, that the ability to learn from it could be limited.  As one commented, \u201cA \nfantastic example is when I was at [firm x] and we we\u2019re trying to do some work for [client x] \nand I spoke to someone in Brazil and they described how they\u2019d used aspiration in an \nadvert.  But when I got the actual advert they\u2019d cast someone who looked like he was out \nof Hanson, you know the boy band, with long blond hair, wearing a T-shirt and messy suit.  \nAnd I couldn\u2019t understand what they meant by aspirational in this sense \u2013 I don\u2019t really \nknow if they even meant that in the end\u201d (A14).  This is, then, a potential limit to the global \nstretching of learning in advertising agencies and the attempts to exploit practice-based \nspaces were often subverted by those who had doubts about the value of stretched \nlearning with recommendations of global consultation being ignored.   \nIn relation to the configuration of practice-based spaces by firms, interviewees \nregularly commented on the almost total or complete absence of any co-ordination of \nactivities at the global group level (i.e. the holding company level such as WPP).  The only \ntype of inter-agency interactions that did occur were at the most senior levels where \u2018high \nlevel planning\u2019 in relation to group strategy and client allocation was dealt with.  It should \nalso be noted in relation to the construction of practice based spaces that \u2018manufactured\u2019 \nspaces were seen as problematic by some advertising executives.  Reflecting the points \nnoted about the cultural and institutional embeddedness of best practices, of fifteen \nadvertising executives interviewed who worked for agencies with such tools four were \nsomewhat negative about their affects.  They found the manufactured approaches too \nrestrictive and limiting when working on a project.  The counter to such an argument by \nthose who liked these tools was that the most important thing about such manufactured \nspaces was how they build upon and complement the \u2018natural\u2019 spaces that already exist.  \n 36\nThis explained why, considering the point noted above, creatives were so negative about \nthese tools.   \nIn terms of the \u2018relational spaces\u2019 outlined, although existing in all of the advertising \nagencies studied there are a number of caveats about their construction and operation that \nshould be taken into account.  First, the emergence of relational networks within project \nteams was often insufficient to enable the most effective knowledge leverage.  Interviewees \nargued that it was necessary to also move outside of project teams and develop \nrelationships with counterparts in other teams doing the same task (i.e. account \nmanagement, planning or creative work).  As one account planner commented, \u201cso you get \nthe [client x] account teams and the [client y] account teams and within each team the \nsharing of knowledge is very strong.  What is essential is that you also consult more widely, \nthere\u2019s massive benefit to be got from talking to planners on other teams and learning from \ntheir experiences but in a slightly different context\u201d (A2).  The second caveat relates to \nvariations in the extent to which adverting executives in different roles developed \nembedded relational networks.  Account planners, manager and directors and other senior \nexecutives were, in general, able to describe in great detail geographically and numerically \nextensive relational networks.  They would always contact overseas colleagues when a \ndifficulty arose or new project was commenced.  In contrast, creatives of all seniority were \nmuch less likely to engage in global consultation, something that is probably the result of \nthe dominant belief in the creatives interviewed that they alone were responsible for \nproducing new ideas and because of their scepticism about practice-based spaces.  As \none creative commented: \n\u201cThe main way we interact with other people in the [firm x] network is when head honchos\u2019 \nhave come here!  It\u2019s important to try and make the network the hero not just one office but \nthat can be quite difficult.  The fact that we do a lot of our creative out of New York makes \nthat harder, I just feel it\u2019s my work and I don\u2019t really know how much other people can help \nme\u201d (A24). \n \nIt should also not be assumed that all account planners and managers developed \nrelational spaces in an equally uniform way.  The most senior advertising executives \nsuggested they travelled to overseas offices between three and eight times a year and, \n 37\ntherefore, benefited from face-to-face encounters that strengthen relational spaces.  \nHowever, less senior individuals generally travelled at most once or twice a year, the result \nof which was a reduced density of global relational networks and a reduction in the \nfrequency and success with which junior advertising executives talked to and learned from \ntheir overseas colleagues.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 38\nReferences \n \nAdvertising Age (2003) 59th Annual agency report.

So they might combine references from pop music to \nreferences to bread and you stir up ideas from different \n\u2018vocabularies\u2019 if you like\u2026 sometimes you\u2019re at an earlier \nstage in the process and you just want to hear what others think \nabout it.
