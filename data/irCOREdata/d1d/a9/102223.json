Introduction \n \nProton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) using commercial membranes such as \nNafion\u00ae from DuPont (USA) have received a large amount of focus as alternative energy \nsupplies. However, these fuel cells often require the use of expensive Pt catalysts at the \nelectrodes. Cheaper and more abundant non-Pt catalysts such as Au and Ag cannot be used as \nthey are chemically unstable under the low pH of a PEMFC [1,2]. On top of the expense of \nusing Pt based catalysts with PEMFCs, the membrane itself is also an expensive component \n[3].  \n \nOne solution to overcome these problems would be to use an alkaline anion exchange \nmembrane (AAEM) instead of the PEM. In this system, the membrane conducts OH- anions \nfrom the cathode to the anode rather than protons (H+) in the reverse direction. AAEMs have \nbeen successfully prepared within our lab from preformed polymer films of varying \nthicknesses. Due to the high pH of the AAEM system, cheaper, more abundant non-Pt metals \nsuch as Au or Ag can now be incorporated for the oxygen reduction reaction [4-6]. \nThe use of AAEMs as a viable alternative to PEMs means that vast areas of research over the \nvarious components of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) need to be revisited. Recent \ngas diffusion layer (GDL) optimisation within our lab discovered that there was a marked \nimprovement in peak power density when changing the GDL of the cathode from carbon \ncloth to carbon paper [7]. We have also recently identified that AAEMs containing quaternary \nammonium functional groups do not suffer with degradation via a carbonation effect from \nCO2 in either air or when supplied with a fuel such as methanol\/ethanol [8] contrary to \npopular belief. \nThis study comprises of an investigation into the effect of thickness of in-house ETFE based \nquaternary ammonium AAEMs followed by performance of unoptimised Au\/C and Ag\/C \ncathode catalysts (made from commercially available catalyst powder) with low loading (0.5 \nmgmetal cm-2). \n \n 3\n2. Experimental \n \n2.1. Materials \n \nEthylene-co-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) film was supplied by Nowofol Kunststoffprodukte \n(Germany) in 12 and 50 \u00b5m thicknesses and by Goodfellow (UK) at 25 \u00b5m. Vinylbenzyl \nchloride (VBC) was supplied by Dow Chemicals and stored in the freezer at \u2013 38 \u00b1 2 oC until \nrequired and used undiluted. Aqueous trimethylamine (TMA Acros Organics, 50%mass) was \nalso used as supplied. Aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH, Fisher Scientific, 1.0 mol dm-3) \nwas used for anion conversion and KOH standard from Riedal-de Ha\u00ebn, (0.1000 \u00b1 0.0001 mol \ndm-3) and hydrochloric acid (HCl, Aldrich, 0.0990 \u00b1 0.0001 mol dm-3) was used for titrations. \n \n2.2. Preparation of the AAEMs \n \nThe Alkaline Anion Exchange Membranes (AAEMs) were produced using 12, 25 and 50 \u00b5m \nETFE polymer films and were irradiated with electron-beam (Isotron, Harwell, UK) to a total \ndose of 4, 4 and 7 MRad, respectively. Lower irradiation levels for the thinner membranes \nwere used as previous irradiation of 25 \u00b5m ETFE with 7 MRad, caused significant \nmechanical degradation. The membranes were functionalised as previously reported by \nVarcoe et al, [9] using vinylbenzyl chloride and trimethylamine. The quaternary ammonium \nfunctionalised AAEMs were produced in the chloride form and converted into the hydroxide \nform by submerging in aqueous potassium hydroxide  (KOH, 1 mol dm-3) for 1 h, changing \nthe KOH(aq) solution twice to ensure complete ion exchange before being used. All excess \nKOH was removed by washing the converted AAEMs in water (grade II water was used in all \nexperiments).  \n \n2.3. Electrodes \n \nTo allow for direct analysis of the influence of the AAEM thickness, prefabricated carbon \npaper electrodes were used for the anodes and cathodes; these comprised of Toray carbon \npaper with geometric catalyst loadings of 0.5 mg cm-2 Pt (Pt\/C 20%mass catalyst particles on \ncarbon) and an undisclosed proprietary loading of PTFE binder from E-Tek (a division of \nBASF). The electrodes were sprayed with 0.50 \u00b1 0.05 mg cm-2 poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) \n(PVBC) using ethyl acetate as a solvent and then submerged in N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-tetramethylhexane-\n 4\n1,6-diamine (TMHDA, undiluted - toxic), for 24 h and washed with water before being ion-\nexchange with KOH(aq) (as with the AAEMs). \nTests for alternative cathode catalysts were performed using prefabricated anode electrodes \ncontaining a Type-A carbon cloth gas diffusion layer (also from E-Tek) and not carbon paper. \nThe alternative cathode catalyst electrodes were fabricated in-house using TGPH-90 carbon \npaper (Toray, E-Tek) as the gas diffusion layer. Catalyst inks consisting of 0.5 \u00b1 0.05 mg cm-2 \nPt, Au or Ag (20 %mass metal catalyst on Vulcan XC-72 carbon support) with 0.75 \u00b1 0.03 mg \ncm-2 PVBC in ethyl acetate  were stirred for several hours before being applied to the carbon \npaper. After drying in air, the electrodes were submerged in TMHDA for 24 h, washed with \nwater and treated with KOH(aq) same as the prefabricated electrodes.  \n \n2.4. Membrane characterisation \n \nThe thicknesses of both the hydrated and dehydrated AAEMs were measured using an \nexternal micrometer (precision \u00b1 2 \u00b5m). \n \nThe ion exchange capacities (IEC) of the AAEMs are determined using a back titration \nmethod as described in [10]. The OH--form AAEMs were submerged in hydrochloric acid \nstandard for 24 h. The solution was then titrated with potassium hydroxide standard. The \nAAEMs were then converted back into the hydroxide form and placed in a desiccator RH = \n0% (over CaCl2) for 7 d before being weighed. The IEC was calculated by (1): \n \n)(\n)()(\n\u2212\n++\n\u2212\n=\nOHm\nHnHn\nIEC\ndry\nfi        (1) \n \nWhere ni(H+) is the initial number of protons in solution, nf(H+) is the final number of protons \navailable and mdry(OH-) is the final weight of the membrane in its hydroxide form. \n \n2.5. Fuel cell tests \n \nThe fuel cell tests were carried out using an Arbin Instruments (College Station, TX) Fuel \nCell Test Station (FCTS). Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), 25 cm2 were produced \nwithout hot pressing, as the MEA has previously been proven to not laminate consistently \n 5\nonce treated with poly(VBC) and TMHDA [9]. The MEA was secured between two graphite \nblocks which had machined triple serpentine flow channels (1 mm channel width, 1 mm \nchannel height and 1.5 mm rib width) and gold coated copper current collector plates. The \nfixture was sealed at a constant torque of 5.5 N m, using bolts and a torque wrench. All \ntesting was carried out with a fuel cell temperature of 50 \u00b1 1 oC with H2 and O2 at 100% \nrelative humidity (RH) and a flow rate of 2 dm3 min-1. \nThe voltage (Vcell, V) and power density (Pcell, mW cm-2) against current density (i, mA cm-2) \npolarisation curves were ran in a forward scan (while going from low to high current density) \nbefore being measured in the reverse scan (high to low current density) using the built-in \nelectronic load of the FCTS under galvanostatic control. The results were taken from the \nreverse scan due to a higher and more stable performance being observed when returning \nfrom high i which is believed to be due to an improved conditioning of the cell. The Vcell was \nallowed to stabilise for between 5 \u2013 10 minutes before each data point was recorded. The \nvoltage recorded by the FCTS was regularly verified by checking against that recorded by a \ncalibrated battery tester (Solartron 1480). Before testing, the cell was allowed to \u2018condition\u2019 at \nhigh current density (potentiostatic cell discharge at Vcell = 50 mV) until the current density \nhad stabilised, this usually took between 2-3 h. This step was determined to be of high \nimportance, as it allowed the MEA to become fully hydrated and ensured the ions and \nassociated water were well distributed (when this step was ran for less than 2 h, the observed \npeak power density was reduced). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used \nfor identification of contributors towards voltage loss of the cell [11]; a Solartron 1260 \nfrequency analyser connected to a 1287 electrochemical interface was attached using a two \nelectrode connection to the running fuel cell (floating, to avoid ground loop interferences), to \nmeasure the total internal area resistance of the MEA (r \/ \u2126 cm2) at each current density. The \ngalvanostatically controlled dc currents were pertubated with small amplitude alternating \ncurrents at decreasing frequencies in the range of 1 MHz - 100 mHz at 7 points decade-1; the \nresulting ac voltage responses were recorded and the ac impedance calculated at each \nfrequency. The amplitude of the ac current was controlled at the lowest values required for \nnoise free spectra to be obtained. The high frequency x-axis intercept corresponded to the cell \ninternal resistance. \n \n 6\n3. Results \n \n3.1. Membrane Characteristics \n \nThe production of the three membranes using e-beam irradiation led to evenly grafted \nAAEMs, characterised by the hydrated\/dehydrated thickness and IEC measurements taken \nfrom multiple areas of the membranes. The average results are given in Table 1. The \nmembranes varied in thickness according to the thickness of the original polymer film. Final \nhydrated thickness of 17, 46 and 85 \u00b5m were achieved respectively (designated S20, S50 and \nS80).  \nThere was a considerable difference in the IECs with S20 > S80 \u2265 S50 (2.25, 1.25 and 1.15 \nmmol(OH-) g-1dry membrane respectively). It is generally agreed that there is an optimum IEC \nvalue of around 0.9 \u2013 1.4 mmol g-1 where too high an IEC would lead to degradation of the \nmembrane structure and too low would produce poor conductivity. However, the much higher \nIEC of the S20 AAEM failed to create significant structural instability and so was not deemed \nexcessive.  \n \nAAEM \nIEC \n\/ mmol(OH-) g-1 (dry membrane) \nThickness \nHydrated \n\/ \u00b5m \nThickness \nDry \n\/ \u00b5m \nS80 1.25 \u00b1 0.11 85 \u00b1 4 71 \u00b1 2 \nS50 1.15 \u00b1 0.10 46 \u00b1 4 38 \u00b1 3 \nS20 2.25 \u00b1 0.13 17 \u00b1 1 15 \u00b1 1 \nTable 1 \n \n3.2. Fuel cell tests: AAEMs \n \nThe H2\/O2 fuel cell performance of the three home-made AAEMs is presented in Figure 1, \nwhere prefabricated carbon paper electrodes were used on both the anode and cathode. There \nwas a significant increase in performance as the thickness of the membranes was decreased, \nwith a peak power density of 230 mW cm-2 observed for the S20 membrane at a current \ndensity of 600 mA cm-2, compared to peak power densities of 160 and 116 mW cm-2 at a \ncurrent densities of 400 and 180 mA cm-2 for the thicker S50 and S80 membrane respectively. \nThis increase in power as the membrane thickness decreases is believed to be a result of the \n 7\nincrease in water crossover from the anode to the cathode through the membrane. Water is \nnow an important reactant at the cathode for the formation of OH- ions from gaseous O2. This \nhypothesis as to the increased performance was verified through use of impedance \nspectroscopy to measure the ir-corrected Vcell, which is presented in Figure 2. \n \nA delayed appearance of the mass transport voltage losses is seen for the S20 AAEM at \nhigher current densities compared to the thicker S50 and S80 membranes. In proton exchange \nmembrane (PEM) fuel cells, mass transport is related to the decrease in oxygen diffusion to \nthe catalyst sites at the cathode, often exacerbated through the increase in flooding at the \ncathode from the production of water. However, the mass transport effect in AAEM fuel cells \nis now believed to be a result of insufficient water transported to the cathode. Therefore a key \ndesign requirement of AAEMs, using H2\/O2, would be the use of thinner membranes. Area \nresistance of the three MEAs remained constant through all current densities, indicating that \nthere was no increase in resistance of the membrane contributing to a decrease in power at the \nhigher power densities. It must however be noted that the area resistance of the three MEAs \ndoes not follow in the expected order with the thinnest membrane possessing the lowest area \nresistance. This is partly due to the MEAs not being hot pressed before running in the fuel \ncell, as the ionomer used will not allow adequate lamination. Therefore the area resistance of \nthe MEAs cannot be probed fully using the current design. \n \n \n 8\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nV\nol\nta\nge\n \/ \nV\nP\now\ner\n D\nen\nsi\nty\n \/ \nm\nW\n c\nm\n-2\ni \/ mA cm-2  \nFigure 1: Fuel cell performance at 50oC, anode: 0.5 mg cm-2 Pt prefabricated carbon paper electrode; cathode: \n0.5 mg cm-2 Pt carbon paper electrode.

Fuel cell tests: Catalysts \n \nPt\/C, Au\/C and Ag\/C were investigated for potential use as cathode catalysts within an \nAAEM system supplied with H2\/O2 at 50oC. The unoptimised cathodes were used in \nconjunction with prefabricated carbon cloth Pt\/C anodes (E-Tek) and S80 (S80 was used in \npreference to the better performing S20, due to more data being available for comparison at \nthe time of testing), under the same fuel cell test conditions used for the differing membrane \nthicknesses. Unsurprisingly, Pt\/C outperformed the two non-Pt metals, with a peak power \ndensity of 62 mW cm-2 at a current density of 140 mA cm-2, Figure 3. The performance of the \ncatalysts decreased in order of Pt\/C > Au\/C > Ag\/C. The ir corrected Vcell Figure 4 shows that \nthe three MEAs experienced similar overpotential trends within the ohmic and mass transport \nregions. The electrokinetic influence however, showed substantial initial losses, especially for \nthe Ag and Au catalysts. Area resistances of the three catalysts varied substantially and in the \norder expected from the power results, decreasing in the order Ag > Au > Pt suggesting that \nfurther development of the non-Pt cathode is required for higher performances. \n \n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\nV\nol\nta\nge\n \/ \nV\nP\now\ner D\nensity \/ m\nW\n cm\n-2\ni \/ mA cm-2  \nFigure 3: Fuel cell performance at 50oC, anode: 0.5 mg cm-2 Pt prefabricated carbon cloth electrode; cathode: \n0.5 mg cm-2 transition metal carbon paper electrode.

Conclusion \n \nAlkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) fuel cells with membrane thicknesses between \n17 \u2013 85 \u03bcm were tested with H2\/O2 at 50oC. The thinnest membrane produced the maximum \npower density (230 mW cm-2) with indications that mass transport of water limited the \nperformance of the thicker membranes.  \nIn addition, Pt\/C, Au\/C and Ag\/C were tested as cathode catalysts for the AAEM system. \nAlthough Pt\/C outperformed the non-Pt catalysts, the use of Au and Ag produced \nperformances of 36 and 19 mW cm-2 respectively at the low loadings of 0.50 mg cm-2 (used to \nkeep consistency across all cathodes). The performances were, however, still encouraging. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe gratefully thank the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) for \nfunding this project through a University of Surrey Doctoral Training Account. \n \n 11\nReferences \n \n[1] M.
