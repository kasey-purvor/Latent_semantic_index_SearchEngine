Doi: 10.1348\/147608305X39644Metadata only entryThe aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between extrinsic religiosity and unhealthy guilt by testing two specific hypotheses. Using multidimensional measures of religious orientation and guilt, among 344 (169 male and 175 female) adults, and consistent with predictions; extrinsic-personal religiosity was found to be related to trait and state guilt, and extrinsic-social religiosity was found to be related to moral standards guilt. The present findings suggest evidence for a present conceptualization of the relationship between extrinsic religiosity and unhealthy guilt as the result of internal and external conflicts.
