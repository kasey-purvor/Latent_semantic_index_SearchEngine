How did it address the child audience at home? Can historical analysis reveal how the \nrelation between television institution and child audience was constructed and governed? \nResisting the naturalistic notion of the child audience as the aggregate of actual children watching \ntelevision, Oswell shows how the television audience was constituted materially and discursively \nduring the diffusion of television in the UK during the post-war period. The \u2018invention\u2019 of the \nchild audience depended on the intersecting activities (shaping, making visible, regulating, \ncommodifying) of diverse actors including broadcasters, journalists, researchers, writers, \ngovernment, parents and children themselves. \n \nTelevision, Childhood and the Home charts the unfolding discussions and debates regarding the child \naudience as documented by broadcasting and government archives. Along the way, we learn that \ninvolving children as participants in programme making is nothing new, we gain an inside \naccount of the BBC\u2019s short-run fascination with puppets for addressing pre-school children \n(with intriguing parallels between the reception of Andy Pandy and today\u2019s Teletubbies), we hear \nof anxious debates over how to devolve responsibility for the child audience from broadcaster to \nparent, there is some wonderful marketing advice on co-ordinating the television set with ones \nliving room d\u00e9cor without disrupting the established gendered division of labour, and, \ndelightfully, we find the origin of \u2018Children\u2019s Hour\u2019 in a Longfellow poem. \n \nWhile historians have linked earlier media with long-standing moral panics over children\u2019s \nsupposed passivity, trashy tastes and delinquent tendencies, along with nostalgia for the days of \noutdoor play, family conversation and \u2018proper\u2019 values, Oswell sees television as distinctive. \nWhere radio took children for granted within \u2018the family audience\u2019, its mode of address asserting \na unifying voice to bring the family together around the hearth, television, he argues, arrived \nwhen the trend towards individualisation \u2013 a dispersal of the family around the home, positioned \nwithin diversified lifestyles - was further advanced, partly because of the coincidental arrival of \ncentral heating (though few public discourses attack central heating for dispersing family \nmembers around the home!).Television thus set out to address this heterogeneous audience, \nincluding the distinctive age cohorts within \u2018the child audience\u2019. \n \nTheoretically, Oswell\u2019s purpose is to undermine the sterile opposition of broadcasting institution \nand audience by drawing on actor-network theory to trace complex relations among diverse \nactors, also contrasting multiple imagined, constructed or scientifically measured conceptions of \n\u2018the audience\u2019 with the diversity of children actually watching television. Yet at times, the \nempirical material instead reaffirms this opposition, for despite revealing the network\u2019s growing \ncomplexity, the actors are generally shown to speak with one voice, constructing \u2018the child \naudience\u2019 as a problematic object of moral anxiety - in need of supervision, inattentive, lacking in \ndiscrimination, even addicted. The acquiescent role of social scientists, especially psychologists, \nin this process particularly attracts Oswell\u2019s critical attention, though one suspects there is a more \ncomplex story to be told regarding the misappropriation of academic research by broadcaster \nand policy discourses, undermining the apparent consensus among elite actors. \n \nChildren themselves play a pivotal role in this history, although their voices remain marginalised \nin the discourses which surround them (including, it must be said, in this book), for it is the \nprivate and elusive character of audiences which makes for such hotly contested, morally fraught \nattempts at governance. Rather than resulting in a manic pursuit of \u2018the audience\u2019, as Ang argued \nin Desperately Seeking the Audience, Oswell sees the early children\u2019s broadcasters\u2019 use of industry \naudience research as an act of modesty, a recognition that they must not presume to \u2018know\u2019 their \naudience \u2013 and indeed, viewers consistently acted in unexpected ways \u2013 children watched adult \nprogrammes (and vice versa), mothers absented themselves from viewing \u2018Watch with Mother\u2019, \nteens emerged during this period as a critical group resentful of the worthy, patronising tone of \nmuch children\u2019s broadcasting, and so forth. Yet in many ways, Oswell tells a sad tale in which a \ndedicated, creative and idealistic band of children\u2019s broadcasters in the 1950s became overtaken \nby the larger attempt to govern the supposedly problematic activities of young people. He \nconcludes by bringing the story up to date, noting recent changes in children\u2019s television \nproduction, in the differentiation of child audiences and in the dispersion of expertise, though \nhis outlook for the future children\u2019s audience remains bleak. \n \nNumber of words: 715 \nSonia Livingstone, LSE \n24 October 2002 \n \n"}
