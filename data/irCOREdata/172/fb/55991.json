Introduction \n \nIn 1839 James Clark Ross set out on a voyage of discovery and research in the Southern Ocean \nwhich was to last until 1843 (Ross, 1847). In April 1842, his ships Erebus and Terror arrived at \nPort Louis in East Falkland having suffered major damage from ice-bergs and collision. Ross set up \na winter base there, repairing his ships, establishing a magnetic observatory, and making \nastronomical, oceanographic and meteorological measurements. \n \nSea level measurements were made every half an hour, and more frequently around the times of \nhigh and low water, from 10 May to 15 December 1842, although with major gaps between \nSeptember and December when Ross took the two ships to Tierra del Fuego in order to make \nsimultaneous measurements of the magnetic field in South America and the Falklands. As a result, \nonly the sea level data up to the end of August are useful. The mean level of the sea at Port Louis \nbetween May and August 1842 was calculated by Ross as being 5 feet 8 inches below two \nbenchmarks cut into the rock of the adjacent cliffs and marked with brass plaques (Ross, 1847, \nvolume 2 and Figure 1). The marks have survived in good condition and afford the possibility, as \nwas Ross\u2019s intention, of estimating changes in sea level between 1842 and points in the future. \n \nThis paper describes how a new set of measurements undertaken at exactly the same spot in \nFebruary-March 2009 has been combined with the 1842 and other measurements at Port Louis and \nwith those from Port Stanley (or Stanley), 25 km to the south-east (Figure 2). The combined data \nset enables the determination of a long term rate of sea level change in the region, and an \n 4\ninvestigation of whether a relatively recent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise has occurred , as \nhas been reported elsewhere in the southern hemisphere and globally. \n \n \n2. Sea Level and GPS Data Sets \n \nRoss\u2019s original journal, listing the entire set of half-hourly measurements at Port Louis, is believed \nto have been destroyed accidentally by the UK Hydrographic Office (UKHO) at some point during \nthe 1990s. Fortunately, the journal was inspected in some detail by William Whewell and co-\nworkers at Trinity College, Cambridge during the nineteenth century, and a record of the heights \nand times of each high and low water was kept in Whewell\u2019s research notes which are preserved in \nthe Wren Library. \n \nOur 2009 Port Louis data set, which covers the period from 24 February to 11 March, was acquired \nwith the use of three sub-surface pressure transducers. Two of the sensors were located adjacent to \nthe Ross benchmarks (indicated by \u2018JCR\u2019 in Figure 2c,d). These sensors were Richard Brancker \nResearch (RBR) XR-420 strain gauges which sampled sea pressure every six minutes and were \ncorrected for air pressure changes with the use of an additional, nearby RBR sensor which \nfunctioned as a barometer. The third instrument, located at a jetty in Port Louis harbour (Figure \n2c,d), was constructed by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory (POL) and consisted of a \n\u2018differential\u2019 transducer attached to a vented cable, such that air pressure corrections were applied \nautomatically. Measurements were recorded by an OTT Hydrometry data logger using one minute \nsampling. This third gauge was used to provide a backup to, and validation of, data sets from the \n 5\ntwo sensors at the relatively open-sea benchmark location. The findings discussed below are \nidentical at the millimetre level with the use of data from any of the three instruments. Datum \ncontrol for the pressure-based time series was provided by means of two tide boards located near to \nRoss\u2019s benchmarks, the heights of which were related to the marks by geodetic levelling. Although \nthis modern data set is short, it has the great benefit of simultaneous recording at the nearby Stanley \ntide gauge, as will be described below. \n \nIn between the 1842 and 2009 measurements, two other important sea level data sets were acquired \nat or near to Port Louis. The first was a set of half-hourly data from a tide gauge installed by the \nUKHO at Green Patch, 2 km across Berkeley Sound from Port Louis (Figure 2). This data set \nspanned December 1981 to March 1982, measurements having been curtailed by the Falklands \nWar. The datum of the gauge was later connected to Ross\u2019s benchmarks by means of Global \nPositioning System (GPS) measurements undertaken in 1996 by a surveying team from HMS \nEndurance. The second was a set of half-hourly sea level measurements obtained from a bubbler \ntide gauge at the harbour jetty, approximately 1 km from the benchmarks (Figure 2). This \ninstrument was installed by the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (as POL was then called) and \nits data set spans May to September 1984. The datum of this time series was related to Ross\u2019s \nbenchmarks by levelling conducted by a surveying team from HMS Herald. \n \nIn 2003, we undertook two sets of sub-surface pressure measurements at Port Louis and Green \nPatch. These data sets, both of several months duration, were obtained with RBR instruments. \nThese records had no datum control and hence are not useful for study of mean sea level change. \n 6\nHowever, they are valuable in providing an estimate of the magnitude of variability in sea level \ndifference between Berkeley Sound and Stanley. \n \nSea level measurements using conventional float and stilling well gauges were made by the UKHO \nat Government Jetty in Stanley during the 1960s and 1970s, although only the data from the 1960s \nare of acceptable quality. Modern pressure-based tide gauges have been deployed by POL at the \nFalkland Interim Port And Storage System (FIPASS) floating warehouses in Stanley since the early \n1990s as part of the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS, see Woodworth et al., 2003). \nThese gauges provide accurate measurements of sea level in addition to sub-surface and air \npressures (Woodworth et al., 1996). Since 2005, an OTT Kalesto radar tide gauge has been added \nto the station to provide data for comparison to and validation of the pressure-based information. \nData from these gauges have been described by Woodworth et al. (2005) and are available from \nhttp:\/\/www.pol.ac.uk\/ntlsf\/. \n \nSea surface heights from the TOPEX\/Poseidon and Jason-1 satellite radar altimeters were obtained \nfrom the University of Colorado global sea level change web site (http:\/\/sealevel.colorado.edu). \nThese data are available in the form of gridded fields and have all environmental and instrumental \ncorrections applied (Leuliette et al., 2004). \n \nDuring the 2009 campaign, simultaneous GPS measurements using Ashtech Micro-Z receivers \nwere made near to the benchmarks at Port Louis and at the Stanley FIPASS tide gauge. These data \nsets were analysed in combination with those from two long-term GPS installations in Stanley \nowned by Ohio State University and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), USA. GPS coordinates of \n 7\nthe benchmarks were computed relative to those given for the JPL station by the International \nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Service (IGS) \n(http:\/\/igscb.jpl.nasa.gov\/network\/site\/falk.html). When combined with a suitable geoid model (e.g. \nEarth Gravitational Model (EGM) 08, Pavlis et al., 2008), and with an assumption of little \noceanographic sea surface gradient between Port Louis and Stanley, then the use of GPS in this \nway should allow sea level data from both sites to be treated as being from the same location. (We \nreturn to the issue of quality of geoid models and the accuracy of this method below.) GPS \nmeasurements were also undertaken near to the main geodetic control points in Stanley and at other \npoints of interest (e.g. Ross\u2019s magnetic observatory marker). \n \nA separate report on the tide gauge and GPS fieldwork undertaken at Port Louis and Stanley in \n2009 is available from the authors. The work included the installation of additional benchmarks at \nboth locations, as a safeguard in case of loss or damage to the original marks, and in order to \ncomply with GLOSS standards for sea level stations (IOC, 2006).  \n \n3. Tests of the Quality of Ross\u2019s Data \n \nAlthough Ross refers to \u2018tide gauges\u2019 several times in the two volumes of his 1847 book, it is not \nclear what sort they were. It is most likely that they were simple tide boards (or \u2018tide poles\u2019) with a \nvertical graduated scale as recommended to captains of Royal Navy ships at that time (e.g. see the \nHydrography section of Herschel, 1849). However, it is conceivable that they could have \ncomprised an upright tube for filtering out wave action, in which a float was attached to an upright \nrod for indicating water level (see the Tides section of Herschel, 1849). Such a float and stilling \n 8\nwell gauge would have been potentially more accurate but somewhat more difficult to install and \noperate. Ross (1847) makes no mention of tubes or floats. \n \nIt will be seen that the conclusions of this paper depend as much upon the quality of Ross\u2019s \nmeasurements as upon that of our more modern data. Although Ross is known to have been an \nexcellent scientific observer in general, it has to be kept in mind that the sea level measurements \nwere not his priority. Therefore, it is necessary to design some tests of their accuracy which can \nprovide confidence in their use in the present study. \n \nFigure 3 presents a time series of daily mean tide level (MTL) from 11 May to the end of August \n1842. Daily MTL is defined as the average of the average high waters and average low waters \nrecorded each day. Also shown is a time series of daily mean air pressure recorded on board the \nErebus, with an allowance for the height of the barometer above sea level (six feet). These \nbarometer measurements are known to have been corrected rigorously for temperature and \ninstrumental biases (Ross, 1847, volume 1) although it is not known how many times a day and at \nwhat times measurements were made. \n \nThe correspondence between daily MTL and air pressure can be clearly seen in Figure 3, with part \nof the difference between the two likely to be due to the steric component of the sea level seasonal \ncycle. The correspondence is also demonstrated in Figure 4(a). In this case, the MTL values have \nbeen corrected for occasional spikes in the daily record which can arise due to aliasing by the semi-\ndiurnal and diurnal components of the tide (primarily the diurnal tides) and both records have been \nsmoothed with a 3 day boxcar filter. A regression fit between the two yields a slope of -0.968 \u00b1 \n 9\n0.049 cm\/mbar, consistent with known values of \u2018inverse barometer (IB) coefficient\u2019 in this part of \nthe world (Mathers and Woodworth, 2001; Woodworth et al., 2005). The daily mean sea level \n(MSL) data set acquired from almost the same location in 1984 (i.e. at the Port Louis harbour jetty \ninstead of near to the benchmarks, Figure 2), covering a similar part of the year, yields a similar \ncoefficient (-0.935 \u00b1 0.048 cm\/mbar, Figure 4b, a boxcar filter not being necessary in this case). \n \nDetermination of the IB coefficient from Ross\u2019s data is not only an interesting finding in itself, but \nprovides a sensitive test of the quality of both the sea level and air pressure information. If the \nquality of either one, or both, of the records had been poor, then the correlation observed would \nhave been less evident. Such checks on the quality of historical data, where information for both \nparameters exists, have been successfully used previously at other locations (e.g. for 18th century \nLiverpool data, Woodworth, 2006). \n \nMany years later, Ross was to make measurements at Port Leopold in Canada which would lead to \nhis being recognized as one of the discoverers of the \u2018IB effect\u2019 (Ross, 1854). However, it is \nunlikely that, at the time of his stay at Port Louis, he would have had a particular insight into the \nIB, and he would certainly not have known the precise value of the coefficient. It is inconceivable \nthat the sea levels and air pressures are other than independent data sets. Therefore, their \ncomparison provides a first test of their quality.  \n \nA second test is to check if the high and low water values provide the same information with regard \nto mean sea level variability. Figure 5 shows values of each quantity, with the astronomical tide \nremoved from each high or low value and with a 3 day boxcar filter applied. In this case, the \n 10\nastronomical tidal heights were calculated from a full set of tidal constants determined from \nanalysis of the 1984 data. Of course, the highs and lows on each day (minus the tide) need not \nalways be identical, as sub-daily sea level variability such as short-duration surges or seiches can \naffect high and low levels differently. However, the low frequency character of the two time series \nshould be similar if \u2018mean sea level\u2019 variation in the data set is to be meaningful. One can see that \nthe two series do indeed correspond closely, although the low waters present a negative bias \nrelative to the high waters of 3.28 cm. Closer inspection shows that the bias originates primarily \nfrom daytime low waters, the series for night-time lows presenting little bias relative to either \ndaytime or night-time high waters. The source of this bias almost certainly stems from some \npeculiarity in the way that the original half-hourly data were acquired during different parts of the \nday, although it is possible that it could have been introduced in the later Cambridge extraction of \nthe highs and lows. The resulting possible bias in mean level of 1.64 (= 3.28\/2) cm is included in \nthe overall uncertainty in Ross\u2019s mean level discussed below.  \n \nA final test is of the timings of Ross\u2019s individual high and low waters, compared to predictions for \n1842 based on tidal constants computed from the 1984 data set. This test is less important with \nregard to our application of Ross\u2019s measurements, which is focused on levels. However, it does \nprovide further insight into general quality. This comparison requires two assumptions: that Ross\u2019s \nclock employed local mean time (from inspection of the Trinity records it seems that Whewell \nmade the same assumption), and that the character of the local tides has not changed significantly \nin the last one and a half centuries. \n \n 11\nThe times of the 1842 high waters were found to be on average 5 minutes later than those \npredicted, the difference between the two sets of times increasing slightly from near zero at the start \nof the record to 15 minutes by the end of August, with a standard deviation in time-difference of 31 \nminutes. Inspection of the short sections of data after August shows that the time-difference was \nmaintained on average at 2 minutes until the end of the year. For the low waters, the average time-\ndifference was larger at 12 minutes, being near zero at the start of the record and increasing to \nabout 35 minutes at the end of August, and with a standard deviation of time-difference of 34 \nminutes. The time-difference was smaller at around 13 minutes in the short sections of data after \nAugust and up to the end of the year. \n \nWe consider these to be satisfactory checks of timings, given that the recorded times were in most \ncases provided only in multiples of 5 minutes, and that times of high waters are more difficult to \ndetermine than levels, even given half-hourly sampling. Nevertheless, the 15 and 35 minute drifts \nin the time-differences for high and low waters respectively are not understood. The fact that the \ntime-differences returned to smaller values in the later sections of data suggests that the variations \nin time-difference must have been due to some kind of alterations in observational practice. \n \nThe standard deviations in time-difference of over half an hour are a consequence of the original \nhalf-hourly sampling, the fact that Whewell probably defined high (and low) heights and times \nfrom the individual highest (and lowest) samples around each tide, rather than perform some kind \nof interpolation, and that non-tidal variability at Port Louis has a standard deviation of 11 cm \n(based on the 1984 data set) compared to an average tidal amplitude of half a metre. A simulation \n 12\nof the time-differences to be anticipated in Ross\u2019s high and water values was made using the 1984 \ndata set, with standard deviations of 28 minutes obtained for both high and low waters. \n \nAlthough Ross\u2019s high and low waters are of good quality, they are in fact not used directly in the \nfollowing analysis. That is because the datum of the measurements, which was presumably the zero \nof the gauge, was not recorded in terms of the heights of his benchmarks in either Ross\u2019s surviving \nrecords or Whewell\u2019s research notes. Therefore, although we can infer what that datum was, there \nis no explicit confirmation of it. Consequently, for a mean sea level estimate we have to rely on the \nheight of the \u2018Ross\u2019 benchmark with its engraved brass plaque (Figure 1), and on the \u2018mean level of \nthe sea 5 feet 8 inches below the benchmark\u2019 statement in Ross (1847, volume 2). This is \nadmittedly not an ideal situation, but is an inevitable consequence of the loss of Ross\u2019s tidal journal \nwhich must have contained more detailed information on the measurements. However, given that \nhe had what must have been good half-hourly data to make that mean sea level calculation, we have \nconfidence in using it. \n \n4. Methods of Analysis of Sea Level Data \n \nThere were three main steps in the analysis of the 1842, 1981-2 and 1984 sea level data sets: \n \n(1) As explained above, sea level in this area is known to have an approximate \u2018inverse barometer\u2019 \nresponse to air pressure changes, which can be large. Consequently, all sea levels have been \nadjusted using surface air pressures. Ross\u2019s 1842 mean sea level was corrected using the air \npressure recorded on the Erebus. For the 20th and 21st century data, daily values of sea level, \n 13\nobtained by application to the sea level data of an appropriate digital filter (Pugh, 1987), were \nadjusted using daily means of surface air pressure obtained from National Centers for \nEnvironmental Prediction \u2013 National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalyses \n(Kistler et al., 2001). Woodworth et al. (2005) concluded that these reanalysis values provide a \ngood representation of air pressure variations in this area. In addition, they have been validated by \ncomparison to an observational data set derived from several locations around the islands (Jones et \nal., 1999). The comparison indicated no significant long term trend but differences of order 1 mbar \nfor some extended periods. Appendix 1 describes how the air pressure adjustments resulted in \nvalues of \u2018corrected sea level\u2019 (SLC). \n \n(2) As each data set was acquired at a different time of year, it was necessary to apply a further \ncorrection to the SLC for the period of measurement as compared to the annual average. This \ncorrection was calculated by averaging the corresponding daily means of SLC from the same parts \nof 13 near-complete years of data from the modern Stanley gauge, and by comparing that average \nto mean SLC over the 13 years. This procedure requires the reasonable assumption that the \nseasonal cycles in Berkeley Sound and at Stanley are the same. Figure 6 displays the seasonal cycle \nof SLC for the 13 years of data, which indicates the magnitude of the correction at different times \nof the year. \n \n(3) Each SLC record can then be expressed relative to the height of Ross\u2019s benchmarks with an \nuncertainty that will be due primarily to the interannual variability in the SLC for the same times of \nyear as the measurements. This uncertainty was calculated from the 13 years of near-complete data \nfrom Stanley to be 2.3 cm for each of the 1842, 1981-2 and 1984 measurements. The uncertainty \n 14\ncomputed this way includes any sea level variability due to the nodal (18.6 year) tide in SLC: that \nis estimated to be only several mm in magnitude in each case if the long period nodal tide has an \namplitude expected from equilibrium theory (Pugh, 1987). \n \nThe uncertainty for 1842 was increased further for the following reasons. Half an inch (1.27 cm) \nwas considered as the standard error of Ross\u2019s mean level due to it being quoted in inches; it is not \nclear how the quoted value was rounded into an integer number of inches. This standard error also \nincludes an uncertainty due to the small difference in height between the two Ross benchmarks (the \n\u2018James\u2019 mark being approximately 1 cm higher than and approximately 60 m to the east of the \nlarger and better preserved \u2018Ross\u2019 mark shown in Figure 1. Both marks are stated in Ross (1847, \nvolume 2) as being 5 feet 8 inches above sea level). The probable bias in daytime low waters (1.64 \ncm) was also taken into account, as was an uncertainty in SLC due to that in sea surface \ntemperature (SST) at the time discussed below (2.8 cm). Therefore, the overall uncertainty becomes \n4.2 cm when uncertainties are added in quadrature. \n \nThe uncertainties for 1981-2 and 1984 were increased to account for possible errors in geodetic \nconnections to the Ross benchmarks. In the 1981-2 case, a connection was made between the Green \nPatch tide gauge and the Port Louis benchmarks with the use of GPS measurements made by HMS \nEndurance in 1996, together with a geoid-difference estimate from EGM08 (the latter being only \n1.1 cm for the 2 km separation across Berkeley Sound). In the 1984 case, a levelling connection \nwas necessary between the Port Louis harbour jetty tide gauge and the benchmarks. That \nconnection was made at the time of gauge installation by the HMS Herald survey team and \nrequired levelling over almost 1 km of soft and hilly ground. We have assessed the errors in such \n 15\nshort distance GPS\/geoid and levelling connections to be around 2 cm. The addition of this term in \nquadrature raises the overall uncertainties for 1981-2 and 1984 to 3.0 cm. We have not included \nuncertainties due to SST in these calculations, the influence of SST on the 1981-2 and 1984 SLC \nvalues being discussed further below. \n \nOther uncertainties are more difficult to estimate. For example, what systematic uncertainty should \nbe attached to the tide board or tide gauge values averaged over their measurement periods? What \nerrors should be attached to any local levelling which Ross must have made? We assume that such \nerrors are at ~1 cm level and, therefore, are less important than the overall uncertainties determined \nabove. The mean values of SLC estimated this way for the 1842, 1981-2 and 1984 measurement \nperiods are shown in Figure 7(a) expressed relative to the height of the \u2018Ross\u2019 benchmark (Figure \n1).  The \u2018Ross\u2019 benchmark height was defined as the average of the heights of 4 brass screws at \neach corner of the plaque, consistent with previous practice by HMS Endurance (details of \nindividual heights may be found in the authors\u2019 fieldwork report). \n \nThereafter, two different analysis methods were applied which combine the measurements from \nBerkeley Sound with those from Stanley. Both methods require assumptions that the spectra of \nvariability in SLC, including the seasonal cycle, are similar at the two locations, and that there are \nno major differences in rates of vertical land movement. Both methods also have the prerequisites \nof accurate local levelling during our 2009 fieldwork, between the major and auxiliary benchmarks \nat Port Louis and Stanley, including of course the Ross benchmarks. Local levellings were made at \nleast twice at each location with repeatability typically at the several mm level. \n \n 16\nThe first analysis method makes use of the fact that our 2009 Port Louis sea level data set was \nacquired at the same time as data were available from the tide gauge at Stanley. The second method \nignores the 2009 Port Louis sea level information and relies on the GPS connections between Port \nLouis and Stanley to combine the various SLC data sets. \n \nAnalysis Method 1 \n \nIn the first method, the average SLC was computed at the two locations for the 14 day \nmeasurement period (25 February \u2013 10 March 2009), and then an offset was applied to the Stanley \ndata such that the two sets of SLC have the same values in that period. Any systematic error is \nestimated to be 1 cm or less, based on a comparison of the Port Louis measurements with both the \npressure- and radar-derived data from Stanley. The root-mean-square (rms) of daily SLC-difference \nbetween the two sites, obtained by comparison of Stanley values to those obtained in 2003 and \n2009 from Green Patch and Port Louis, was also found to be 1 cm. We regard the uncertainties in \nSLC due to errors in the offset to be negligible. When the offset is applied to the entire Stanley \nrecord, including data from both Government Jetty and FIPASS, we obtain the time series of \nmonthly means included in Figure 7(a). \n \nIt is important to realise that the SLC connection between Port Louis and Stanley, which makes use \nof the short 2009 Port Louis data set, has centimetric accuracy. That is because any common sea \nlevel variability at the two sites cancels in the computation of the offset. However, if the fortnight \nof Port Louis data were to be added to Figure 7(a) in its own right, in the same way as we have \nincluded the 1842, 1981-2 and 1984 data, then an uncertainty would have to be attached to its \n 17\naverage SLC, after seasonal correction, as for the other measurement periods. In this case, the \nuncertainty due to interannual variability has a larger value of 3.4 cm. However, local levelling and \nother errors considered are smaller than for the earlier periods. The star in Figure 7(a) represents \nthe 2009 Port Louis SLC computed in this way and, while it is based on only a short record, it \nprovides an important test of consistency with the SLC connection method, as will be discussed \nfurther below.   \n \nThe importance of using SLC values in this exercise instead of measured sea levels is demonstrated \nby Figure 7(b), in which measured MSL values at Port Louis and Green Patch have been included, \nand monthly means of sea level at Stanley have been referred to those at Port Louis with the use of \nthe 2009 daily sea level, as opposed to SLC, information. It can be seen that, while the essence of \nfindings with regard to long term sea level change and possible recent acceleration (to be discussed \nin detail below) is also represented in this figure, it contains a considerably noisier set of \ninformation. In particular, the 1984 measurement appears low (due to high air pressure at the time), \nthe Stanley monthly means exhibit considerably higher variability, and a larger standard error \napplies to the 2009 Port Louis measurement shown by a star (the latter with a seasonal correction \napplied as discussed above for the corresponding SLC value).  \n \nAnalysis Method 2 \n \nThe second analysis method, which relies on the accuracy of the GPS connection between the two \nsites and on an assumption of little gradient in sea surface topography (mean sea surface minus \ngeoid), results in the data distribution shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that Figures 7(a) and 8 are \n 18\nsimilar but that the Stanley SLC data transferred by GPS to Port Louis in Figure 8 differ from those \nin Figure 7(a) by approximately 5 cm. Given the accuracy of the first method, we believe that this \ndifference is primarily a consequence of errors in geoid-difference, as calculated by EGM08, \ntogether with possible centimetric sea surface topography differences. EGM08 formal errors at Port \nLouis and Stanley are approximately 10 cm. Consequently, one would expect that errors in EGM08 \ngeoid-difference must be at least of the order of several cm, even without regard for omission \nerrors. We expect that this second method will be repeated using the same sea level data when more \naccurate geoid models, which take into account more copious local gravity information, become \navailable. Meanwhile, all findings discussed below are based on the first method. \n \nIt will be noted that a similar GPS-based method was used to make a geodetic connection between \nthe 1981-82 Green Patch tide gauge data and the Port Louis benchmarks. However, in that case the \ndistances involved were so short that errors in GPS relative height and geoid-difference are likely \nto have been at the ~1 cm level. \n \n5. Relationships between SLC and Sea Surface Temperature \n \nAn important question, prior to a discussion of long term trends in sea level, is whether any of the \nSLC values in Figure 7(a) might have been affected by anomalous meteorological or oceanographic \nconditions. Although extreme sea level events can occur during storms and due to the high-\nfrequency seiching which occurs around the Falklands coast (Woodworth et al., 2005 discuss \neffects of wind forcing and seiches on Stanley sea level), Figure 4(a,b) has demonstrated that the \nadjustment of sea level to SLC is likely to have been an adequate one with regard to meteorological \n 19\ninfluences, when averaged over the several months of each of the historical sets of measurements. \nHowever, the present study has also indicated the possibly greater importance of oceanographic \n(steric) variability to a discussion of SLC variations. \n \nFigure 9 demonstrates that the variability of Stanley SLC is very similar to that observed in deeper \nwater around the islands by satellite altimetry, and so must be representative of variability over an \nextended area. This suggests that oceanographic conditions determine the variability in SLC rather \nthan coastal wind or wave setup. The only period of disagreement at the ~5 cm level is for August \nto October 2008. However, the monthly mean sea levels obtained from the pressure and radar \ngauges at Stanley agree to ~1 cm in this period, and the close agreement in SLC between tide gauge \nand altimetry is restored thereafter. The most likely interpretation is that the area of negative SLC \nanomaly on the Patagonian shelf in this period was of different magnitude at the in situ tide gauge \nlocation and off-shore. \n \nFigure 10(a) shows the same monthly mean SLC values together with those for SST obtained from \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation (OI) SST \nVersion 2 (V2) data set (http:\/\/www.cdc.noaa.gov\/data\/gridded\/data.noaa.oisst.v2.html). The SST \nanalysis is produced weekly on a one-degree grid using in situ and satellite SSTs, with the satellite \ndata adjusted for biases using the method of Reynolds (1988) and Reynolds and Marsico (1993). \nThe data set commences at the end of 1981. Figure 10(a) shows that both SST and SLC at Stanley \nhave a seasonal cycle, with that for SST leading SLC by approximately 1.5 months, while the two \ndeseasonalised time series (Figure 10b) are similar with a correlation coefficient between them of \n 20\n0.466 at zero lag (0.425 and 0.424 at lags of 1 and 2 months respectively). The corresponding \ncoefficient for annual mean values is 0.767. \n \nThe Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is an oscillation in sea level pressure between a node centred \nover Antarctica and an annulus encircling the Southern Ocean, and is quantified by the SAM, or \nAntarctic Oscillation, Index (e.g. Thompson and Wallace, 2000). Meredith et al. (2008) \ndemonstrated a relationship between SST and the SAM in a large area around South Georgia, in the \nScotia Sea and on the continental shelf around the Falklands, using values of SAM index from the \nClimate Prediction Center of NCEP (http:\/\/www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov). Their Figure 3 shows modest \ncorrelation (~0.3) between SST and SAM in the Stanley area, and the present analysis has obtained \na similar correlation between Stanley SLC and SAM (coefficient of 0.459 using annual means \ndetrended over the measurement period). Therefore, Stanley SLC is affected in a positive sense by \nthe strength of the Southern Ocean atmospheric circulation, represented by the SAM index, in \ncontrast to SLC for stations in Antarctica which are related to the SAM in a negative sense (Hughes \net al., 2003; Meredith et al., 2004). \n \nStanley SLC is simulated satisfactorily by the Ocean Circulation and Climate Advanced Modelling \nProject (OCCAM) ocean circulation model (Webb et al., 1997) forced by wind fields up to 2004, \nwith a correlation coefficient of 0.690 between measured and modelled annual mean SLC (both \ntime series detrended over their years in common). On the other hand, our attempts to simulate \nStanley SLC satisfactorily with a barotropic (depth averaged) version of OCCAM have been \nunsuccessful so far, although limited model resolution and other technical factors remain to be \nimproved upon. Therefore, for present purposes, we have concluded that Stanley SLC variability \n 21\ncould well contain contributions from steric processes related to the wind field and SAM, as well as \nfrom processes which do not depend upon stratification. Such steric variability could consist of \nhalo-steric as well as thermosteric fluctuations, with the observed variations in SST being an \napproximate proxy for both in combination. Hydrographic data, such as those used to derive time \nseries of global steric changes (cf. Domingues et al., 2008), do not exist in sufficient quantity to \nenable local steric time series to be computed. \n \nTemperature-dependent contributions to the earlier SLC data sets must also be considered, if a \nrelationship between SLC and SST exists. A comparison of rms values of the time series in Figure \n10(b) suggests that a SST anomaly of 1\u00b0 C corresponds to an SLC anomaly of approximately 5.6 \ncm. Consequently, we can to some extent further explain the low data point for the 1984 \nmeasurements in Figure 7(a). SST anomaly in that period (May-September) averaged -0.4\u00b0 C \n(Figure 11), which suggests a lower SLC than normal of approximately 2.2 cm. Similar periods of \nnegative SST anomaly, for which we have corresponding SLC information, occurred during 1995-\n1996, 2000-2002 and 2007-2008 (Figures 9, 10b and 11). The SST anomaly during the 1981-2 \nmeasurements (December-March) was approximately zero. \n \nOne might ask what values of SST occurred during Ross\u2019s stay at Port Louis. The average of his \ndaily values of \u2018mean temperature of sea at surface\u2019 from 11 May to the end of August 1842 was \n4.1\u00b0 C, which corresponds to an anomaly of -1.6\u00b0 C with respect to the seasonal average SST \nderived from 27 complete years (1982-2008) of NOAA OI SST data. At face value, this suggests \nthat the Ross SLC value of Figure 7(a) was lower than normal by as much as 9 cm. However, while \nthe biases in SST measurements, averaged over many ships and for extended periods, tend to be of \n 22\nthe order of 0.1\u00b0 C, even for the Southern Ocean during the middle of the 19th century (cf. Figure \n18 of Folland and Parker, 1995), the uncertainty in (probably bucket) measurements by any one \nvessel, even in more recent times, could be of the order of 1\u00b0 C (Kent and Berry, 2008). \nConsequently, Ross\u2019s SST value has to be treated with caution, especially as it is not known at \nwhat time of day the measurements were made and by what method. There is even the possibility \nthat, as the ships were careened for at least part of this period, the SST measurements were made \nfrom the beach, which would in the winter have biased them low. \n \nRoss also measured the daily mean \u2018temperature of the air in the shade\u2019 which averaged 2.1\u00b0 C \nduring May-August 1842, compared to average values of 2.7 and 3.0\u00b0 C (standard deviations 0.4 \nand 0.8\u00b0 C respectively) for the same parts of the year measured by the Met Office at Stanley \n(1959-1980) and at Mount Pleasant airport 44 km SW of Stanley (1989-2008). This is likely to be a \nmore robust estimate of temperature and suggests that, while the winter of 1842 was probably \ncolder than normal, it was not exceptionally so (Ross, 1847, volume 2 includes no mention of harsh \nwinter conditions).  Variability in winter air temperatures in the Falklands is similar to that in SST \n(Figure 12) with a correlation coefficient between May-August average values of 0.719 and with a \nratio of 0.56 for the standard deviation of SST compared to that of air temperature. Consequently, \nan air temperature anomaly of -0.9\u00b0 C in the Ross period is likely to have corresponded to an SST \nanomaly of approximately -0.5\u00b0 C and an SLC anomaly of -2.8 cm. While we have not applied this \ncorrection to Ross\u2019s sea level measurement shown in Figure 7(a), as we have no reliable direct \nmeasure of SST (and such a procedure would involve an assumption that the regional mean climate \nduring the mid-19th century was similar to that of recent decades), we have included it within the \noverall SLC error assessment, as mentioned above. \n 23\n \n6. Long Term Changes in Sea Level \n \nBased on Figure 7(a), it is possible to compute an average rate of rise of sea level (SLC) from the \n1842, 1981-2 and 1984 data. These values were obtained from measurements at Port Louis and \nGreen Patch in Berkeley Sound only, and not by transfer from Stanley. The lower trend line in \nFigure 7(a) is constrained to pass between the 1842 and 1984 values, yielding a rate of 0.23 \u00b1 0.35 \nmm\/year. The standard error of the trend was estimated by combining a standard error for mean \nlevels in the 1980s, defined by half of the difference between the 1981-2 and 1984 values (an \namount which is similar to the individual standard errors), with the uncertainty in 1842. If we adopt \nan estimate of -0.52 mm\/year for the rate of present-day sea level change expected due to Glacial \nIsostatic Adjustment (GIA, see below), then we obtain 0.75 \u00b1 0.35 mm\/year for the average rate of \nsea level rise in the region corrected for vertical land movement. \n \nIt is also possible to compute a rate in terms of change from Ross\u2019s measurement to those obtained \nover the last two decades at Stanley. That produces a value of 0.54 \u00b1 0.26 mm\/year for the period \nfrom 1842 to the mid-point of the recent data (upper trend line in Figure 7(a)) or 1.06 \u00b1 0.26 \nmm\/year after GIA correction. In this case, the standard error is assumed to be dominated by the \nuncertainty in 1842 alone. An important question is whether the two estimates are compatible. It \ncan be seen that the 1981-2 value is within one standard error of the upper trend line in Figure 7(a), \nwhile that for 1984 falls about 7 cm below it. However, it will be recalled that there is reason to \nbelieve that the 1984 value is biased low by ~2 cm due to the lower SST at the time, while the \n1981-2 value is relatively unbiased by SST. Consequently, the 1984 value can also be claimed to be \n 24\nonly one standard error away from the long-term trend shown by the upper line. The Government \nJetty data from Stanley from the late 1960s are broadly consistent with both trend lines.  \n \nThe GIA correction applied above is derived from predictions of the ICE-5G v1.2 ice model \ncombined with either the VM2 or VM4 earth models of Peltier (2004), which are available from the \nPermanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) web site \n(http:\/\/www.psmsl.org\/train_and_info\/geo_signals\/gia\/peltier). It is an update to the correction of \n-0.59 mm\/year used by Woodworth et al. (2005) which was based on the earlier ICE-4G (VM2) \nmodel of Peltier (2001, 2004). Both of these models pay particular attention to the role of rotational \nfeedback and \u2018broad shelf effect\u2019 (Peltier and Drummond, 2002). The rotational feedback \ncomponent is particularly important in reproducing the highstands of sea level observed along the \nSouth American coast (Rostami et al., 2000; Peltier, 2004, 2007; Peltier and Luthcke, 2009) and is \nas important within discussion of Falklands sea levels.  \n \nFew geological measurements have been made in the Falkland Islands themselves which might \nconfirm or disprove such a long-term rate of uplift. As discussed in Woodworth et al. (2005), the \nonly relevant study known to us is that of Roberts (1984), summarised by Clapperton and Roberts \n(1986) and reviewed by Aldiss and Edwards (1999). These reports present evidence for high stands \nof sea level in the geological past, of which two sets several metres above present sea level almost \ncertainly formed after 5000 BP, including one particularly important data point from a raised beach \n6 km east of Stanley and 6 to 8 m above present sea level. These high stands are comparable in \namplitude to those found along the coast of Patagonia, where Rostami et al. (2000) estimated a \nlonger-term tectonic uplift value of 0.09 mm\/year, additional to Holocene GIA rates, which should \n 25\nalso be representative of the Falkland Islands. This area of the Patagonian shelf experiences few \nlarge earthquakes that might result in abrupt vertical land movement (see for example Figure 6.1 of \nAldiss and Edwards, 1999). \n \nIn principle, confirmation of an uplift of the order of 0.5-0.6 mm\/year should be possible by means \nof continuous GPS measurements. Ohio State University has operated a GPS station on Lookout \nHill above Stanley since 1999, the vertical motion of which has been analysed within a reference \nframe defined by over 200 GPS stations distributed worldwide (the 'VREF' set of Bevis et al., \n2009). This reference frame is similar to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2005 \n(Altamimi et al., 2007). Within that frame, the Stanley GPS has an upward velocity of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 \nmm\/year (95% standard error) (private communication, Prof. Mike Bevis, Ohio State University). \nThis rate is lower than expected from the GIA model (Peltier, 2004) but invites further comparison \nas the Stanley GPS record length increases and as GIA models continue to develop. \n \nIf we now turn to the recent sea level information, the rate of change of SLC at Stanley from \nNovember 1992 to the end of 2008 was 1.99 \u00b1 0.58 mm\/year (Figures 7(a) and 9), or 2.51 mm\/year \nwhen corrected for GIA. Since the start of this period, precise measurements of sea surface height \nfrom space by the TOPEX\/Poseidon and Jason satellite radar altimeters have become available. The \naltimetric trend in sea surface height adjusted for the \u2018inverse barometer\u2019 in the area of ocean \naround the Falklands was 2.79 \u00b1 0.42 mm\/year over almost the same period (Figure 9), comparable \nto the rate observed by the Stanley gauge. The two recent values are considerably in excess of the \nlong-term rate and indicate a relatively recent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise. (We have not \napplied a GIA correction to the quoted altimeter rate (i.e. in effect a correction for the local rate of \n 26\nchange of the geoid) as that correction is expected to be considerably smaller than the \u2018statistical\u2019 \nerror, cf. Figure 8d of Peltier, 2004.) \n \n7. Discussion \n \nPort Louis was not the only sea level measurement location with which Ross was associated. Pugh \net al. (2002) and Hunter et al. (2003) have discussed measurements made at Port Arthur, Tasmania \nby T.J. Lempri\u00e8re from mid-1837 to at least the end of 1842. The scientific value of these \nmeasurements was increased greatly in July 1841 by the addition of a benchmark in order to \nprovide a datum reference to the sea level data. This installation was made at the suggestion of \nRoss, after having been encouraged to install marks wherever sea level measurements were made in \na letter from Alexander von Humboldt. Ross received von Humboldt\u2019s letter via the Admiralty after \nhe had arrived to over-winter in Tasmania (Ross, 1847, volume 2).  \n \nHunter et al. (2003) concluded from the historical and modern Port Arthur measurements that sea \nlevel had risen at an average rate of 1.0 \u00b1 0.3 mm\/year since 1842, after a small correction for \nvertical land movement. This rate is consistent with our own long-term estimates, providing further \nevidence from data sparse regions of the southern hemisphere that sea level has been rising during \nthe 19th and 20th centuries at a rate comparable to that in the northern hemisphere (Bindoff et al., \n2007). \n \nHowever, which of our 0.75 mm\/year (Berkeley Sound data only up to the 1980s) or 1.06 mm\/year \n(Ross\u2019s 1842 measurement combined with the last two decades of data from Stanley) is to be \n 27\npreferred as a long term rate? At first, it seems unreasonable to, in effect, give greater weight to less \nthan 4 months of measurements in 1984 at Port Louis, and choose the lower trend line, than to \nprefer over 16 years of data at Stanley, thereby selecting the upper trend line. However, it can be \nseen from Figure 7(a) that, if the rate of approximately 2 mm\/year observed at Stanley during the \n1990s and 2000s is representative of the last quarter-century, then a \u2018two stick\u2019 trend model \nbecomes more plausible, with a long term trend represented by the lower line together with a recent \nacceleration. \n \nThe joining of Stanley data to those from Port Louis and Green Patch, thereby appearing to produce \na recent acceleration, does look odd. However, a similar conclusion would have been drawn from \nthe Berkeley Sound data alone without the benefit of the long Stanley record (other than in the \nprovision of a seasonal cycle correction). As described above, the star in Figure 7(a) shows the SLC \nover our 14 days of measurements in 2009, corrected for air pressure and seasonal cycle in SLC in \nthe same way as for 1842, 1981-2 and 1984. Although the measurement period was short, one \nmight have concluded on the basis of this single point that a recent acceleration had occurred.  \n \nThe star lies a little above the earlier monthly mean SLC values from Stanley. SST in February to \nMarch 2009 was high for that time of year, with an anomaly of approximately 0.5\u00b0C (Figure 11) \nwhich suggests that SLC was higher than normal by about 2.8 cm. When all the Berkeley Sound \nand Stanley data are considered together, then it can be seen that the Stanley monthly mean SLC \nrecord provides a plausible interpolation between the Berkeley Sound data of the 1980s and 2009. \n \n 28\nWhile it might be the case that the rate of SLC change in recent decades has been larger than the \nlong term value, the lack of data between 1842 and 1981-2 allows other interpretations of Figure \n7(a). For example, there could have been a negative trend during most of the 19th century, an \nacceleration at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, and a higher rate during the 20th century \nas a whole. Such behaviour would have been similar to that observed in long sea level records from \nthe northern hemisphere (e.g. at Brest, France see W\u00f6ppelmann et al., 2006). In this case the higher \nrates seen between 1981-2 and 2009 would not necessarily be describable as a \u2018recent acceleration\u2019. \nNevertheless, in the absence of a continuous record, then the simplest interpretation remains a \u2018long \nterm\u2019 trend with a value, after GIA correction, similar to that at Port Arthur. \n \nIf we focus on the recent decades, then the consistency between tide gauge measurements, GIA \ncorrection and altimetric data provides reassurance with regard to the evidence for an increased rate \nof sea level rise. However, there is no corresponding increase in levels on the neighbouring \ncontinental coastline. As the Argentine tide gauge information is fragmented, two composite SLC \nrecords were made by combining records from Buenos Aires and Palermo, and Mar del Plata and \nQuequen, using annual mean sea levels from the PSMSL (http:\/\/www.psmsl.org) and inverse \nbarometer air pressure corrections using the HadSLP2 air pressure data set \n(http:\/\/hadobs.metoffice.com\/hadslp2\/). The latter has coarser spatial resolution than the NCEP-\nNCAR product but extends back to the 19th century. Rates of vertical land movement were assumed \nto be the same for each pair of nearby stations. The composite records (not shown) suggest no \nacceleration during the last few decades. However, they are from lower latitudes than Stanley (34 \nand 38\u00b0 S respectively compared to 51\u00b0 S), time series from stations further south along the \nArgentine coast being of little use in this application. In addition, one notes that records from \n 29\nstations near to the River Plate estuary are affected considerably by river runoff connected to El \nNi\u00f1o \u2013 Southern Oscillation events (Douglas, 2001). \n  \nMost regions worldwide are known to have experienced higher rates of sea level rise in the 1990s \n(e.g. Holgate and Woodworth, 2004), although whether that rate of rise was unprecedented in the \ninstrumental record is a matter of debate. Merrifield et al. (2009) have suggested that the 1990s \nacceleration was indeed unusual in that it took place in most ocean basins, with particular \ncontributions from the tropics and from higher southern latitudes. The Falklands data would appear \nto be consistent with that picture. \n \n8. Conclusions \n \nSea level measurements at Port Louis in East Falkland in 1981-82 and 1984 have been compared to \nthose made by James Clark Ross in 1842, with each set of measurements made with respect to the \noriginal benchmarks installed by Ross. This comparison has provided an estimate of how sea level \nhas changed in the area over approximately one and a half centuries. The long-term rate of 0.75 \nmm\/year between 1842 and the early-1980s, after correction for air pressure effects and for vertical \nland movement due to GIA, is similar to that obtained over a similar period, and using similar \nmethods, at Port Arthur in Tasmania (Pugh et al., 2002; Hunter et al., 2003). This long-term rate is \nalso similar to those observed in the northern hemisphere during the 19th and early 20th centuries \n(Church et al., 2001; W\u00f6ppelmann et al., 2008). \n \n 30\nDuring February and March 2009, a further set of sea level measurements was undertaken at Port \nLouis with respect to the same benchmarks. Although the measurement period was short, the value \nof mean sea level obtained was an accurate one and infers that a relatively recent acceleration in the \nrate of sea level rise has taken place. \n \nHowever, the 2009 data set has proved to be of greatest value as a means of combining the \nhistorical data from Port Louis with those from the permanent tide gauge station at Stanley, 25 km \nto the south-east, using the Method 1 described above. The Stanley SLC data have been shown to \nprovide an effective interpolation between the Port Louis measurements during the early-1980s and \nthose in 2009. The Stanley data suggest that the rate of change of sea level in East Falkland since \n1992 has been approximately 2.5 mm\/year, a rate supported by information from satellite altimetry. \nAltogether, these data sets provide evidence for a recent acceleration in the rate of sea level rise that \nis consistent with accelerations reported for other locations in the southern hemisphere and \nglobally. Whether the high recent rate is some kind of decadal fluctuation, or is the start of an \naccelerated climate change (cf. Rahmstorf et al., 2007), remains to be seen. \n \nA relationship between Stanley SLC, SST around the islands and the SAM index has been \nidentified, providing more understanding of the differences in SLC observed between sets of \nhistorical sea level measurements. The study of such relationships may prove to be of wider interest \nin understanding the atmosphere and ocean dynamics of the region and thereby the sources of \nvariability in sea level in East Falkland and the SW Atlantic in general. \n \n 31\nThe geodetic benchmarks established by Ross at Port Louis in 1842, relative to which all sea level \nmeasurements at that location have been made, have survived in good condition and have been \ncomplemented by a set of ancillary marks established in 2009. These marks offer the possibility for \nfurther studies of long term sea level change to be undertaken at the site in the future. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nOur fieldwork would not have been possible without many kinds of help from Peter Foden and Jeff \nPugh of the POL Ocean Engineering and Technology Group. They provided most of our equipment \nincluding one of the tide gauges used at Port Louis. We are very grateful to Ross Chalenor and \ncolleagues at the Falkland Islands Public Works Department who assisted us in many ways. Peter \nand Melanie Gilding and George and Jenny Patterson-Smith were excellent hosts during our visits \nto Port Louis. We thank Paul Hughes (John Moores University Liverpool) who discovered the Ross \nhigh and low water records in the Wren Library. Ian Vassie (formerly of POL) made first analyses \nof the 1984 Port Louis data set. Mark Tamisiea and Angela Hibbert (POL), Mike Meredith and \nPauline Sackett (British Antarctic Survey), Steve Nerem (University of Colorado), Mike Bevis \n(Ohio State University), Liz Kent (National Oceanography Centre Southampton), David Parker \n(Met Office), Richard Peltier (University of Toronto), Catia Domingues (Commonwealth Scientific \nand Industrial Research Organisation, Australia) and John Hunter (University of Tasmania) also \nprovided help and advice. This work was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council \nand supported by a grant from the Shackleton Fund to DTP, who also acknowledges that his \nattention was first drawn to the existence of the Ross benchmarks at Port Louis by the late Sir \nGeorge Deacon. \n 32\nAppendix 1: \n \nMethod of Computation of Corrected Sea Level (SLC) from Mean Sea Level (MSL) Values \nObtained at Port Louis and Green Patch in Berkeley Sound \n \nJames Clark Ross had been encouraged by Alexander von Humboldt to install benchmarks \nwherever extended sea level measurements were made. Consequently, Ross would have been aware \nthat it was likely that his measurements at Port Louis would be repeated at some point in the future. \nSimilarly, we hope that other researchers will make measurements with respect to the same \nbenchmarks at Port Louis at some point later in this century. Port Louis is an environmentally \npristine location, the benchmarks (both Ross\u2019s original marks and our newly installed ones) are \nlikely to survive for many years to come, and the likelihood is that future measurements will be \nboth feasible and scientifically interesting. \n \nA first concern relates to the preservation of historical information. In order to guard against further \ndisasters, such as the loss of Ross\u2019s original journal of half-hourly sea level measurements, copies \nof all sea level and GPS data sets, and relevant documents in electronic form, will be lodged with \nthe British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC, www.bodc.ac.uk) and the Falkland Islands \nGovernment Archives. (Copies of the logs of several of Ross\u2019s officers, some of which contain \nmeteorological information, have recently been made available in electronic form via the British \nAtmospheric Data Centre (BADC), www.badc.ac.uk.) \n \n 33\nA second concern stems from the fact that our analyses have been based upon the use of SLC \nwhich is quantity derived from the measured MSL. Therefore, it is important to explain how SLC \nwas computed, and the likely errors involved, so that future researchers can reproduce and extend \nour results. \n \nAll SLC values given in this paper were derived from the relationship: \n \nSLC = MSL + (AP \u2013 APref) * 0.9948                                                     \n(1) \n \nwhere SLC and MSL are measured in cm, surface air pressure (AP) is given in mbar, a reference air \npressure (APref) of 1001.98 mbar chosen, that being the average surface air pressure at Stanley for \nthe period January 1948 \u2013 March 2009 from NCEP-NCAR, and the factor of 0.9948 represents a \ntypical IB response. \n \nTable 1 lists the measurement periods at Port Louis and Green Patch in 1842, 1981-2, 1984 and \n2009 and the measured MSL values in these periods. As explained above, the MSL for 1842 is \ntaken simply from the information in Ross (1847, volume 2), while the MSL values for the other \nperiods could if required be recomputed from the original sea level data files lodged with BODC.  \n \nThe Port Louis measurements in 1842 will have been made close to the Ross benchmarks in \nBerkeley Sound (Figure 2) while those for 1984 were made at the harbour jetty. Measurements in \n2009 were made near to the benchmarks (two sensors) and at the jetty; results presented in Table 1 \n 34\nare based on the former. Also provided to BODC will be measurements of sub-surface pressure \nwith 3 minute sampling obtained at Green Patch and Port Louis harbour jetty between 20 April and \n22 September 2003; these data have no corresponding barometer information or datum control. \n \nTable 1 also shows the air pressure correction applied to the MSL information (equation 1), the \n1842 air pressures having been extracted from Ross (1847, volume 2) and those in later periods \nfrom NCEP-NCAR. The correction can be seen to be only a small number of cm in each case, with \nthe exception of 1984 which was a period of high air pressure. The penultimate column of Table 1 \ngives the additional correction applied to allow for the seasonal cycle in SLC on the east coast of \nthe Falkland Islands. The final column presents the SLC values given in Figure 7(a). \n \nSeveral variations could be made in the method of determining SLC from MSL. For example, we \nhave employed a typical IB factor in equation (1) (Aviso, 1994). This produces a form of SLC akin \nto sub-surface pressure. However, we have demonstrated above that the effective \u2018IB coefficient\u2019 at \nPort Louis is closer to 0.95 than 0.9948, on daily timescales at least, while Woodworth et al. (2005) \nshowed with the use of monthly mean values from the Government Jetty and FIPASS gauges that a \nsimilar factor applies at monthly and longer timescales. It can be seen from Table 1 that the choice \nof a factor ~5% different from that employed results in only a 3 mm change in air pressure \ncorrection for the case when the correction was largest in 1984. \n \nEquation (1) was also used to convert monthly mean MSL values from the Stanley tide gauge to the \nSLC values displayed in Figure 7(a). For most of the monthly means, a 5% variation in the factor \nresults in SLC values differing from those shown by only millimetres and, in the most extreme \n 35\ncases, differences of 4 and 7 mm for odd months of Government Jetty and FIPASS data \nrespectively when air pressure variations were largest. \n \nA second issue with equation (1) is that, instead of APref, a reference air pressure could have been \nchosen representative of average air pressure over the global ocean, as is standard practice in \naltimeter data processing (AVISO, 1994). Global-ocean average air pressure has an rms variation \nof approximately 0.54 mbar, and has a large annual component which peaks in southern \nhemisphere winter (e.g. Figure 3a of Wunsch and Stammer, 1997). Given that two of the \nmeasurement periods in Table 1 were in summer (1981-2 and 2009) and two were largely in winter \n(1842 and 1984), but noting that, with the exception of 2009, measurements took place over several \nmonths, an error in air pressure correction of the order of 0.5 mbar could remain from the simpler \nparameterisation of equation (1). A less quantifiable issue concerns interannual variations and \nsecular trends in global-ocean average air pressure, especially with regard to the use of the chosen \nvalue of APref for adjustment of the 1842 data. \n \n \n 36\nReferences \n \nAldiss, D.T., and E.J.
