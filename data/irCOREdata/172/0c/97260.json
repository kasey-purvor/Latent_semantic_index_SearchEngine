Introduction\u2014the modelling of cilia-driven flow by slender body theory\nCilia are microscopic hair-like appendages found throughout most of the animal\nkingdom in, among others, the digestive, excretory, respiratory and reproductive\nsystems. Cilia, typically, have radius of around 0.1\u20130.2 \u00b5m and length of from\naround 2\u20133 \u00b5m for \u2018primary cilia\u2019 in the embryonic node to around 6 \u00b5m in the\nlungs and over 10 \u00b5m in microscopic swimming organisms. Cilia have the same in-\nternal structure as eukaryotic flagella such as the spermatozoon tail, which in some\nspecies can be over 100 \u00b5m in length.\nSince cilia-driven flow velocities are typically of the order of less than 100 \u00b5m\/s\nand oscillatory frequency less than 20 Hz, associated Reynolds numbers are typ-\nically no larger than 10\u22123 or 10\u22122, even for fluid viscosities as low as water, and\nso the steady Stokes flow equations are employed. Cilia can be characterised as\nslender bodies, with slenderness ratio varying from 10 to over 100. A large body of\ntechniques for modelling flows produced by individual or multiple slender bod-\nies, exploiting the linearity of the Stokes flow equations has been developed,\nincluding the initial work of Burgers (1938), Hancock (1953) and Tuck (1964);\ntechniques based on asymptotic expansions such as Batchelor (1970), Cox (1970),\nTillett (1970) and the later, highly accurate work of Johnson (1980) and Bartha and\nLiron (1988a,b); slender bodies near or across fluid interfaces (Fulford and Blake,\n1986a), models of arrays of cilia (Blake, 1972; Liron and Mochon, 1976a; Fulford\nand Blake, 1986b; Gueron and Liron, 1992); and models of flagellar propulsion\nLighthill (1976); Higdon (1979). These techniques involve representing the action\nof a cilium by a centreline distribution of point forces, represented by the singular\n\u2018Stokeslet\u2019 solution, possibly together with higher order singularities such as the\npotential source dipole to satisfy the boundary condition on the surface of the flag-\nellum. Additional recent developments include the development of a slender body\nmethod for unsteady Stokes flow by Clarke et al. (2006) to model high frequency\nmicrofluidics. These techniques are very desirable in that they reduce the solution\nof a three-dimensional PDE problem to the determination of a one-dimensional\nline of singularity strengths. They also take into account the moving boundary of\nthe cilium surface in a very natural way, and allow for the inclusion of boundaries\nsuch as an epithelial surface or coverslip by the use of an appropriately chosen\nsingularity (such as Blake, 1971; Liron and Mochon, 1976b).\nIn this paper, we shall describe a straightforward and efficient implementation of\nthis technique for modelling the flow generated by multiple cilia with prescribed\nbeat pattern. The technique combines the Chwang and Wu (1975) distribution\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1479\nof Stokeslets and dipoles generating a slender ellipsoid, with variable Stokeslet\nstrength to allow for a curved centreline, as in Johnson (1980), together with a\nsimple integral equation algorithm that gives very acceptable results even in the\nnear-field of the cilium. We apply the technique to two problems: the flow in the\nembryonic node, where a small number of primary cilia perform rotational mo-\ntions about tilted axes to produce a directional flow; and the flow of periciliary\nliquid (PCL) in the liquid lining of the lung, using the metachronal simplification\nof Liron and Mochon (1976a) together with a combination of singularities that pre-\nserves both near and far-field accuracy while maintaining efficiency, and a physi-\ncally based mucus velocity field as a boundary condition. Finally, we discuss future\ndirections for singularity modelling in various biological systems.\n2. Representing a single cilium\nAs in the work of Blake (1972) and Liron and Mochon (1976a), we begin by\ndefining \u03be(s, t), a curve describing the time-dependent shape of the centreline of\na cilium whose base is fixed at the origin. \u03be(s, t) = (\u03be1(s, t), \u03be2(s, t), \u03be3(s, t)), where\ns is the arc length along the cilium, varying between 0 and L, and t is time, vary-\ning between 0 and T, where T is the period of the ciliary beat cycle. The ciliated\nsurface lies in the plane x3 = 0.\nOne could attempt to model the internal mechanics of the cilia in order to ex-\nplore such questions as the emergence of the cilia\/flagellar beat, or the emergence\nof metachronism: for example, see Gueron and Liron (1992, 1993); Gueron and\nLevit-Gurevich (2001). However, for this study, we shall focus on the flow fields\nproduced by cilia with known beat pattern and frequency.\n2.1. Singularity solutions\nThe Stokeslet Sjk(x, y) is the velocity at x due to a point force at y in the ek direc-\ntion, hence the vector Sk = (S1k, S2k, S3k) is the solution of the Stokes flow equa-\ntions\n\u2212 \u2207 pk + \u00b5\u22072Sk + ek\u03b4(x \u2212 y) = 0,\n(1)\n\u2207 \u00b7 Sk = 0,\nwhere \u03b4 denotes the three-dimensional Dirac delta distribution. The velocity field\nresulting from some point force f is then given by u = Sk fk. Here and in what\nfollows, we use the summation convention.\nIn an infinite fluid S\u221ejk = (\u03b4 jk\/r + r jrk\/r3)\/(8\u03c0\u00b5). The potential dipole, or dou-\nblet, is a higher order singularity given by Kjk = (\u03b4 jk\/r3 \u2212 3r jrk\/r5)\/(4\u03c0). This\nsingularity decays much more rapidly, and will have a far less significant effect on\nthe far-field when compared with the Stokeslet. However, in the near-field it may\nbe important.\nCilia do not beat in an infinite volume, the dominant boundary effect being that\nof the surface they are attached to. Based on the observation that the curvature\nof such surfaces is generally small compared with the cilium length, the surface is\n1480 Smith et al.\ngenerally modelled as an infinite plane x3 = 0. In order to model micro-organism\nswimming, Blake (1971) derived using Fourier transforms the image system for a\npoint force in a semi-infinite region x3 > 0 with a no-slip boundary at x3 = 0. The\nsemi-infinite singularity may be represented by the infinite domain Stokeslet, an\nequal and opposite image Stokeslet in the boundary, and a combination of the\nhigher order singularities of the \u2018stresslet\u2019 and \u2018Stokes doublet\u2019 to give a far-field\nthat, quite unlike the infinite domain solution, decays with O(1\/r2). We shall use\nthis solution in Section 3, in order to show how tilted rotating nodal cilia interact\nwith a plane boundary to effect net propulsion.

This solution was derived originally to model flow in\nciliated reproductive tract. We shall use it to model flow in the periciliary\nlayer, which has depth approximately equal to the cilia length L. In this pa-\nper, we denote it SCjk; we also consider the summed and integrated form of this,\nDCjk(x1, x3, \u03be1, \u03be3) :=\n\u2211\u221e\nq=\u2212\u221e\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e S\nC\njk(x1, x2, x3, \u03be1 + q\u03bb, 0, \u03be3) dx2 where \u03bb is the\nmetachronal wavelength defined in Section 4.1.

Using singularity distributions to represent the cilium\nSince the cilium is a slender body, we require that there will be an approximately\nconstant velocity on any circular cross section. We also require that for any given\nmotion of the cilium \u03be\u02d9 , there exists a centreline distribution of singularities that\nwill give rise to a fluid flow u that is equal to \u03be\u02d9 on the whole of the surface of\nthe cilium. We compare three different distributions, to determine which gives\nthe most satisfactory representation. To begin with, we will work in the infinite\ndomain.\n2.3. Stokeslet distribution\nSlender body theories are based on the concept of replacing the cilium with a line\ndistribution S\u221ek (x, \u03be(s, t)), of strength fk(\u03be(s, t)). With the summation convention,\nthe velocity field given by a line of Stokeslets alone is\nu(x, t) =\n\u222b L\n0\nS\u221ek (x, \u03be(s\n\u2217, t)) fk(\u03be(s\u2217, t)) ds\u2217. (4)\nApplying this equation on the cilium, u(\u03be(s, t)) = \u03be\u02d9(s, t) and so\n\u03be\u02d9(s, t) =\n\u222b L\n0\nS\u221ek (\u03be(s, t), \u03be(s\n\u2217, t)) fk(\u03be(s\u2217, t)) ds\u2217. (5)\nHence we have a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind for the force distribu-\ntion fk(\u03be(s, t)). In what follows, we nondimensionalise with L as the length scale,\n\u03c3 L at the velocity scale, \u03c3\u22121 as the time scale and \u00b5\u03c3 L2 as the force scale (so that\nthe scaling for fk is \u00b5\u03c3 L). The singularity Sk is, therefore, rescaled with respect\nto (\u00b5L)\u22121. Since the problem has no t dependence, the solution at any point in\ntime depends only on \u03be and \u03be\u02d9 at that time. Consequently, throughout much of this\nstudy, it will be convenient to take t to be fixed and suppress the t dependence.\n2.4. Discretisation\nOne could solve this equation by directly replacing the integral with a quadrature\nformula and solve the resulting matrix equation. However, S\u221ek (x, \u03be) varies very\nrapidly for x close to \u03be , so that the calculated velocity on the surface exhibits un-\nacceptable oscillations between meshpoints. Hence, we divide the cilium into the\nsegments ((i \u2212 1)\/N, i\/N) with midpoints si = (i \u2212 0.5)\/N, and assume that the\nforce distribution fk(\u03be(s)) can be approximated by the midpoint value fk(\u03be(si )).\nThis leads to\n\u03be\u02d9(sq) =\nN\u2211\ni=1,i \u0005=q\nfk(\u03be(si ))\n\u222b i\/N\n(i\u22121)\/N\nS\u221ek (\u03be(sq), \u03be(s\n\u2217)) ds\u2217\n(6)\n+ fk(\u03be(sq))\n\u222b q\/N\n(q\u22121)\/N\nS\u221ek (\u03be(sq) + \u03b1n, \u03be(s\u2217)) ds\u2217,\n1482 Smith et al.\nwhere n = (n1, 0, n3) is the normal to the cilium axis in the plane in which the cilia\nbeat. We can then apply the midpoint rule with Q points to each integral, using the\nmidpoints sil = (i \u2212 1)\/N + (l \u2212 0.5)\/(QN). Hence, we have\n\u03be\u02d9(sq) = 1QN\n\u239b\n\u239d N\u2211\ni=1,i \u0005=\nQ\u2211\nl=1\nS\u221ek (\u03be(sq), \u03be(sil)) fk(\u03be(si ))\n(7)\n+\nQ\u2211\nl=1\nS\u221ek (\u03be(sq) + \u03b1n, \u03be(sql)) fk(\u03be(sq))\n)\n.\nThis is essentially the algorithm used by Liron and Mochon (1976a), but with ad-\nditional refinement to prevent oscillations between meshpoints. The +\u03b1n term\nmoves the point of evaluation off the cilium axis and onto a point on its surface\nto ensure that the Stokeslet is large, but finite. We shall verify that the boundary\nconditions are satisfied to a high degree of accuracy a posteriori.\nEquation (8) can be rearranged into a system of 3N equations for 3N unknowns,\nthe fk(\u03be(si )) for i = 1, . . . , N and k = 1, 2, 3, and solved numerically, for exam-\nple, with the F04AAF NAG library routine. The solution for the velocity field\nmay then be calculated using the discretised version of Eq. (4). The above dis-\ncretisation technique will be used for all subsequent integral equations in this\npaper.\nWhen solving integral equations of the first kind, various difficulties may be en-\ncountered. One such problem is the existence of non-trivial solutions f to the\nhomogeneous equation 0 = \u222b 10 f (s)S(s) ds\u2014this means that the inhomogeneous\nproblem will not have a unique solution and numerical results may be incorrect.\nWe have tested the algorithm with \u03be\u02d9 set to zero, but the only solution obtained\nfor f was the zero solution. It is important when discretising this type of integral\nequation that the resulting matrix is not singular or severely ill-conditioned, other-\nwise the solution is likely to be wildly oscillating. The kernel S\u221ejk becomes large at\npoints where r = n, which is useful because it ensures the diagonal elements of the\nmatrix are relatively large compared with the other elements, so that the solution\nis stable.\nOnce the force distribution is found, the algorithm can be checked for consis-\ntency by evaluating the velocity on the cilium surface. Using n = (n1, 0, n3) and\nb = (0, 1, 0) to denote the unit normal and binormal to the cilium centreline,\nwe apply two tests: is the velocity on the line \u03be(s) + \u03b1n on the cilium surface\nequal to the cilium velocity \u2202\u03be\/\u2202t(s, t), and is the velocity constant on the circle\n\u03be(s) + \u03b1 cos \u03b8n + \u03b1 sin \u03b8b, on the cilium surface for 0 < \u03b8 < 2\u03c0?\nNumerical results for this algorithm are shown in Fig. 1. In graph (A), there\nis an excellent fit to the boundary conditions except for near the cilium tip,\nwhere the calculated velocity diverges significantly from the cilium velocity.\nGraph (B) shows a variation of around 10% in the velocity moving around the\ncylinder. We now consider refined approaches that represent the cilium more\naccurately.\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1483\n00\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nA\nVelocity u1\n00\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nB\nVelocity u1\nAn\ngl\ne \nar\nou\nnd\n c\niliu\nm\n \u03b8\nFig. 1 (A) Profile along cilium for Stokeslet code, true cilium velocity at node points given by *.\nN = 10, Q = 11, \u03b1 = 0.1\/6.

Adding the potential source dipole to improve accuracy\nThe initial work of Burgers (1938) and Hancock (1953) was developed by Tuck\n(1964), Cox (1970), Batchelor (1970), Tillett (1970) and others using the theory\nof matched asymptotics. Slender bodies of various cross sections and in various\nincident flows were still represented by line distributions of Stokeslets, but with the\nforce distributions being determined by asymptotic theory. Expansions were taken\nin the parameter (log \t)\u22121, where \t is the slenderness ratio, which is not ideal due to\nit not being a particularly small parameter. Inspired by a Hancock\u2019s original study,\nLighthill (1976) suggested that flagella could better be modelled by considering\nthe combined action of Stokeslets and potential dipoles distributed on their axes.\nAs proved in Childress (1981), the flow at x = 0 around a straight circular cylinder\nof radius a, lying on the x\u2013axis between x = \u2212b and x = c (a, b, c > 0, a \u0006 b, c) is\ngiven by a distribution of Stokeslets of strength f and dipoles of strength a2f n\/4\u00b5,\nwhere f n is the component of f normal to the cilium axis. A corresponding \u2018curved\ncylinder\u2019 shape at an instant during the beat cycle is shown in Fig. 2(A).\nFig. 2 (A) Cylindrical cilium. (B) Ellipsoidal cilium.\n1484 Smith et al.\nLighthill presented a result that was remarkably simple and elegant. The flow\ndue to a combination of Stokeslets and dipoles representing a cylinder \u2018. . . is\nclosely matched by flagellar motions such that the cross section of a flagellum at s0\nmoves with velocity\nfn(s0)\n4\u03c0\u00b5\n+\n\u222b\nr0> 12 a\n\u221a\ne\nf \u00b7\n[\nI\n8\u03c0\u00b5r0\n+ r0r0\n8\u03c0\u00b5r30\n]\nds. . . \u2019 (8)\nThe first term is the normal force on the flagellum, the second term is a non-\nsingular line integral of Stokeslets. The error was found by Childress (1981) to\nbe O(\t1\/2), errors in the velocity on the surface of the cylinder due to centreline\ncurvature \u03ba and variation in the force distribution f were shown by Lighthill to be\nO(a\u03ba) and O(a f d f\/ds), respectively. This \u2018Lighthill theorem\u2019 was extended fur-\nther to model cilia by Gueron and Liron (1992) to include the effect of a nearby\nboundary, and to extract a term in the tangential component of the force also,\nsince this term may, in fact, be dominant. This technique, known as the \u2018LGL the-\norem\u2019 is particularly efficient due to the fact that it requires only the evaluation of\na non-singular integral. It is very suitable for more computationally difficult prob-\nlems such as the emergence of a coordinated beat, as, for example, the recent study\nof Gueron and Levit-Gurevich (2001). A slightly different approach employed by\nHigdon (1979) in modelling bacterial swimming was to retain the full Stokeslet and\ndipole distribution but integrate the singular parts analytically and use numerical\nintegration for the regular parts. This was later found to compare very favourably\nwith results using the much more computationally expensive Boundary Integral\nEquation method (Phan-Thien et al., 1987).\nHowever, as noted by Liron (2001), this \u2018cylinder\u2019 representation has the lim-\nitation that it is not accurate near the ends of the cilium, particularly the distal\nend. This may be expected, since Batchelor (1970) noted that, \u2018. . . for a body as\nfar from being longitudinally elliptic as is a cylinder, the numerical accuracy of the\n[Stokeslet distribution] is rather limited unless [the slenderness ratio] is exceeding\nlarge. . .\u2019\nAn alternative approach is to model the cilium as a curved slender ellip-\nsoid, as depicted in Fig. 2(B). Chwang and Wu (1975) showed that the flow\naround a straight prolate spheroid x2\/\u03b22 + (y2 + z2)\/\u03b12 = 1, \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b1 is given pre-\ncisely by a distribution of Stokeslets with strength f and dipoles with strength\n(l2 \u2212 x2)\u03b12\/2\u03b22f. The focal length is 2l, so that l = (\u03b22 \u2212 \u03b12)1\/2. In nondimensional\nunits, where the cilium length is 1, we choose l = 1\/2, then \u03b22 = 1\/4 + \u03b12. For\nthis study, we shall use the values \u03b1 = 0.1\/3, 0.1\/6, which give \u03b2 = 0.5011, 0.5003.\nChwang and Wu (1975) calculated the force for a straight ellipsoid in a num-\nber of incident flows explicitly, but, for flexibility, we shall fix only the ratio of\nStokeslet and dipole strengths, and revert to the numerical approach to deter-\nmining the force distribution. This has much in common with the leading order\nsolution technique of Johnson (1980), although he derived a second-kind integral\nequation to be solved iteratively, whereas we shall determine the force distribution\ndirectly.\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1485\n00\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nVelocity u1\nA\n00\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nB\nVelocity u1\nAn\ngl\ne \nar\nou\nnd\n c\niliu\nm\n \u03b8\nAr\nc \nle\nng\nth\n a\nlo\nng\n c\niliu\nm\n s\nFig. 3 (A) Profile along cilium for slender ellipsoid representation.

(4) with\nG\u221ek (x, \u03be(s\n\u2217)) := S\u221ek (x, \u03be(s\u2217)) +\n\u03b12\n1\/2 + 2\u03b12 s\n\u2217(1 \u2212 s\u2217)Kk(x, \u03be(s\u2217)).

(11)\nIn Fig. 3(A) there is a very significant improvement in the fit between the cilium\nvelocity and the calculated velocity at the cilium tip. Figure 3(B) shows that the\nvariations in velocity around the cilium are still very small, comparable with the\nresults for the Stokeslet and cylinder algorithm.\n2.6. Singularity distributions for the semi-infinite and confined domain\nThe above models were designed for a slender body moving in an infinite do-\nmain. However, in order to model a cilium in a semi-infinite region (x3 > 0) or\na confined region (0 < x3 < L) such as the oviduct or periciliary layer, we employ\nthe semi-infinite Stokeslet that satisfies S\u221e\/2jk (x3 = 0) = 0 and the confined domain\nStokeslet, that additionally satisfies SCjk(x3 = 0) = 0 = SCjk(x3 = L), as depicted in\nFig. 4. We shall not modify the dipole, due to its higher-order decay. It is neces-\nsary to verify that the ellipsoid representation given above is still accurate. Simu-\nlation results are given in Figs. 5 and 6. The profile along the length of the cilium\nis again very satisfactory, even at the tip. The relative error in the velocity on a\n1486 Smith et al.\nL\n0\nSCjkS\n\u221e\/2\njk\nFig. 4 Left\u2014the semi-infinite domain x3 > 0. Right\u2014the confined domain 0 < x3 < L.\ncircle around the cilium is less than 0.1, which is very acceptably accurate. It may\nbe noted that due to the dipole not being zero at the no-slip boundary x3 = 0,\nthere is a small deviation from the expected smooth convergence to zero veloc-\nity. However, the error is still very small in relation to the bulk of the fluid flow,\nand, in particular, any error will decay away from the cilium with O(1\/r3), and so\nwill not significantly affect conclusions for the flow in most of the liquid. Based on\nthe calculations presented here, we conclude that the slender ellipsoid is the best\nrepresentation for the cilium, and will use this in the rest of the study.\nIn the next section, we apply the technique to a simple system that captures\nsome of the important physics of flow generation by a small number of embryonic\nnodal cilia, in order to show the physical mechanism by which a directional flow\nis established. Then, in Section 4, we present a more detailed model for flow in\nthe airway surface liquid of the lungs than has previously been considered. This\ndemonstrates how the discrete cilia approach can be used to obtain a high level of\ndetail regarding a system that has already been extensively studied.\n3. Flow generation by embryonic nodal cilia\nCilia-driven flows have been implicated in establishing left\/right symmetry break-\ning in mouse embryo development (see, for example Nonaka et al., 2005), and\na nodal flow has been observed in a number of species (see, for example Okada\n0 0.1\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\nVelocity u1\nAr\nc \nle\nng\nth\n a\nlo\nng\n c\niliu\nm\n s\nA\n0\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nVelocity u1\nAn\ngl\ne \nar\nou\nnd\n c\niliu\nm\n \u03b8\nB\nFig. 5 (A) Profile along cilium for slender ellipsoid algorithm, semi-infinite domain.

At around 8 days post-fertilization, following the establishment of the\nanteroposterior and dorsal\u2013ventral axes, a structure known as the ventral node is\nobserved on which are found primary cilia. These cilia have size around 2\u20133 \u00b5m\nand they rotate with an approximate frequency of 10 Hz about an axis tilted to-\nwards the posterior (Okada et al., 2005). The degree of tilt may be less, as indi-\ncated by the measurements of Nonaka et al. (2005) who found an average tilt that\nhas recently been measured as being approximately 40\u25e6 (Okada et al., 2005), but\nother results suggest it may be less (Nonaka et al., 2005). The node has a roughly\ntriangular shape, is around 50 \u00b5m across and is covered by Reichert\u2019s membrane\n(Nonaka et al., 1998). The cavity is filled with extraembryonic liquid, and has a\ndepth of the order of 20 \u00b5m (based on the data of Okada et al., 2005). Nodal cilia\nhave been found to transport debris and tracer particles to the \u2018left\u2019 of the node in\na plane close to the ciliated surface, with a corresponding \u2018rightward\u2019 counterflow\noccurring above due to the space being sealed. Furthermore, a mechanical model\nof cilia at low Reynolds number has been shown to replicate this effect (Nonaka\net al., 2005). For consistency with the biological literature, the axes are designated\nas in Fig. 7.

Furthermore, it is not understood how the\nflow is converted to asymmetric gene expression (McGrath et al., 2003). The origi-\nnal hypothesis (Nonaka et al., 1998) concerns the asymmetric distribution of mor-\nphogen chemicals, which may have \u2018inactivation times\u2019 (Cartwright et al., 2004) to\nprevent a uniform distribution occurring. Another hypothesis (Tabin and Vogan,\n2003) states that sensory immotile cilia on opposite sides of the node bend differ-\nently in response to the flow, changing intracellular calcium ion levels differently.\nA detailed appreciation of the generation and of the oscillatory nature of the flow\nfield would be of great assistance in determining how likely a chemical gradient\nis to be established, and parameters for inactivation times. It would also assist in\ndetermining how cilia on different sides of the node might be differently affected\nby the flow field.\nNodal cilia are much sparser than the dense cilia of the airways, as can be seen\nfrom the micrographs in Nonaka et al. (1998)\u2014only one cilium protrudes from\neach cell. The spacing of the cilia is of the order of several cilium lengths. In addi-\ntion to this, the ciliary beat is very different, being a tilted rotational motion rather\nthan asymmetric shaped \u2018effective\u2019 and \u2018recovery\u2019 stroke as observed in standard\n\u20189 + 2\u2019 cilia (Sanderson and Sleigh, 1981). Brokaw (2005) and Nonaka et al. (2005)\nhave noted that, much like the mechanism of standard ciliary propulsion (Blake\nand Sleigh, 1974), the interaction of the cilium with the nearby boundary during\nthe rightward part of the stroke will limit the negative flow generated and, hence,\nresult in a net leftward flow.\nThe purpose of this section is to demonstrate the utility of the discrete cilia tech-\nnique and to explore the nature of the directional flow generated by a small array\nof tilted slender bodies through interaction with a plane boundary. In particular,\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1491\nwe shall be concerned with finding if there is a continuous rightward transport\nclose to the boundary, as discussed by Nonaka et al. (2005). At this stage we shall\nnot attempt a full model of the fluid dynamics in the node, and coupling the flow\nwith symmetry breaking mechanisms, although these shall be subjects for future\nwork.\nIn order to demonstrate the principles at work, we shall represent the cilium\nshape by the curve shown in Fig. 8. The positive and negative x2 directions will\nbe the \u2018anterior\u2019 and \u2018posterior\u2019 directions, respectively, so that the cilia are be\ntilted towards the negative x2 direction. Viewed from above, the rotation will be\nclockwise. The ciliated surface will be given by x3 = 0, and the fluid will be taken\nto occupy the domain x3 > 0. This is a simplification of the real node that will\nhave additional boundaries at the top and sides, but, at this stage, we will only be\nconcerned with showing how the interaction with the nearby boundary causes a\ndirectional flow.\nA finite array of m0 cilia with known shape \u03ben and velocity \u03be\u02d9\nn\n(n = 0, . . . , m0 \u2212 1)\ncan be represented using the above technique in a similar way to Eq. (11), only\nwith the sum\nu(x) =\nm0\u22121\u2211\nr=0\nI[x, \u03be r ; G, f], (0 < s < 1, n = 0, . . . , m0 \u2212 1). (12)\nThe resulting integral equation is then simply,\n\u03be\u02d9n(s) =\nm0\u22121\u2211\nr=0\nI[\u03ben(s), \u03be r ; G, f], (0 < s < 1, n = 0, . . . , m0 \u2212 1). (13)\nSimilar to the above, this discretises resulting in 3m0 N linear equations for the\nthree scalar values of f at the N interpolation points on each of the m0 cilia.\nTo determine the effect of the cilia on particles in the liquid, we used the follow-\ning pathline tracking algorithm based on Heun\u2019s second-order ODE method:\ntime step i , position xi , time ti\ncalculate force distribution f(\u03be r ) at time ti from \u03be r , \u03be\u02d9\nr\nfrom Eq.

(12)\nset xi+1 = xi + (\ft)(u(xi , ti ) + u(x\u2217i , ti+1))\/2\ngo to time step i + 1\nThis algorithm demonstrates the utility of the singularity method: there is no need\nto calculate the flow over the whole domain at every timestep, it is simply enough\n1492 Smith et al.\nto find the strength of the force distributions and calculate the fluid velocity on\nthe particle being tracked. Moreover, from the assumption of periodicity, it is only\nnecessary to calculate the force distributions over one period of rotation.\nTo simulate dispersion of morphogen chemicals in the node, the effect of Brow-\nnian motion must be considered. For chemicals or tracer particles with a diffusion\ncoefficient of less than 100 \u00b5m2\/s , the Peclet number will be less than 1, and hence\nBrownian motion will not be a dominant effect. For chemicals with higher diffusiv-\nities, a combined advection\u2013diffusion formulation would be required. In the next\nsection, we present results examining particle transport in the advective regime\nonly.\n3.1. Results\nThe results of tracking particles propelled by an array of three nodal cilia are given\nin Figs. 9\u201313. Except where stated, all the cilia are in phase, i.e. have equal phase\nangle, and rotate clockwise when viewed from above, with frequency 10 Hz. The\naxes labels are scaled with respect to cilium length L. Based on typical values of\ncilium length 3 \u00b5m and radius 0.1 \u00b5m, the parameter \u03b1 is therefore 0.1\/3. This\nparameter affects the force distribution and, hence, the flow field via Eq. (7). In all\nof the graphs, we shall refer to the positive x1 direction as the \u2018left\u2019 of the node,\nwhich appears as the right-hand side of the diagrams.\nFigure 9 shows how particles beginning in the centre of the array are swept to\nthe \u2018left.\u2019 The net propulsion effect is very similar from z = 0.3 to z = 1.2, with\nall four particles drifting a similar distance. It is clear that there is no continuous\nlayer of \u2018rightward\u2019 transport, even close to the floor of the node, which Nonaka\net al. (2005) noted would be a consequence of the analysis of Cartwright et al.\n(2004). Note that the particle transport is relatively slow, in that it requires 60\ncilium revolutions (6 s) to advect the particles just over 2 cilium lengths (6 \u00b5m).\nThe speed of the leftward flow in the mouse appears to be 1\u20133 \u00b5m\/s from the data\nof Okada et al. (2005). Hence, our simplified model gives results that are within\nthe experimentally measured range.\nFigure 10 shows pathlines for particles starting nearer to a cilium envelope. The\nparticles starting from z = 0.3\u20130.9 are all drawn into a path around the nearby\ncilium. They are lifted above their starting locations by the tilted rotational velocity\nfield, then swept back down to a symmetric position on the other side of the cilium\nand finally are drawn on to the \u2018left\u2019 by the combined far-field flow of all three\ncilia. In the absence of the nearby boundary, the particles would instead continue\nto circle the rotating cilium, but as noted by Brokaw (2005), due to the presence\nof a boundary, the flow generated by the leftward cilia movement is stronger than\nthe flow generated by the rightward movement. Hence, the particles are swept to\nthe \u2018left.\u2019 An alternative perspective is to consider the image system of a rotational\nflow in the wall, as discussed in Section 3.2.\nFigure 11 shows three nearby particles starting close to the \u2018nodal floor\u2019 at\nz = 0.2. The particle starting closest to a cilium envelope is drawn even closer to\nthe nodal floor, then travels very slowly (taking 200 revolutions or 20 s) across to\nan adjacent cilium, whereupon it is follows a circular path in which it may remain\ntrapped for some time. The remaining two particles are drawn towards a different\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1493\ncilium that lifts them above the surface, as in Fig. 10. The particles are then trans-\nported to the \u2018left,\u2019 finally exhibiting a gradual upward drift. This also corresponds\nto the stresslet far-field discussed in Section 3.2\nIt is also clear from Fig. 11 that relatively small changes to the initial position will\nat some points result in entirely different particle pathlines\u2014possibly resulting in\ntrapping by a cilium for one or many rotations, or transport directly to the \u2018left.\u2019\nFigure 12 shows the trapping and release of particles by a cilium \u2018vortex.\u2019 Par-\nticles starting at z = 0.3 and z = 0.6 are trapped in approximately circular paths,\nas would be predicted from the infinite rotlet model of Cartwright et al. (2004).\nThe particle starting above the cilium tip at z = 1.2 is advected to the \u2018left,\u2019 and\nis drawn towards another cilium, although it does not enter its circulatory vortex.\nThe particle starting at z = 0.9 behaves differently depending on the phase differ-\nence of the cilia (Fig. 12) or the cilium radius (Fig. 13). It performs one or several\nrevolutions of the cilium before escaping to the \u2018left,\u2019 as observed by Nonaka et al.\n(1998). Conversely, phase difference does not appear to affect the main \u2018leftward\u2019\nflow significantly.\n3.2. Discussion\nThe particle tracking results show clearly how the posterior tilt interacts with the\nlower boundary to produce net \u2018leftward\u2019 transport. For particles starting suffi-\nciently far from the envelopes of the cilia, they are generally advected to the \u2018left\u2019\nno matter how close they are to the lower boundary. Particles between x3 = 0.3\nand x3 = 1.2 are advected with speed approximately 1 \u00b5m\/s, which is at the lower\nend of the range observed by Okada et al. (2005). Near the envelope of a cilium,\nparticles starting near the level of the cilium tip are swept to the left, particles\nstarting lower down may be trapped in vortical motion around the axis of rotation\nof the cilium. Our results are consistent with the video recordings of Okada et al.\n(2005) which show that just above the tips of the cilia, at around x3 = 4 \u00b5m, there\nis continuous particle transport to the left. We also observed that particles closer to\nthe envelope of a cilium may make one or several revolutions before being swept\nonwards to another cilium, as observed by Nonaka et al. (1998).\nCartwright et al. (2004) stated that \u2018. . . corresponding to the directional flow\nabove the rotlets, an equal and opposite flow exists below them. We should expect\nthis counterflow in the node also, except that there it will be modified by the pres-\nence of the node walls . . . .\u2019 From the discrete cilia simulations, we do not observe\na rightward flow close to the boundary, nor would we expect one since the bound-\nary effect completely dominates any flow due to the rightward stroke of the cilium.\nParticles close to the path of the cilium may remain trapped in circular paths, but\nparticles which are not trapped are always transported to the \u2018left.\u2019\nClose to the cilia envelopes, we observed that there may be chaotic dynamics,\nwith particles which start close together following very different trajectories. We\nalso found that particles will follow unpredictable \u2018circling and escape\u2019 trajectories\nthat were sensitive to the radius to cilium length ratio, and the cilia phase differ-\nence. We did not undertake a study of measures of possible chaotic dynamics, but\nsuch mixing may have important implications for the establishment or smoothing\n1494 Smith et al.\nFig. 14 The image system for a rotlet of strength \r1 with axis parallel to and a distance h from a\nplane boundary in Stokes flow is given by: an equal and opposite rotlet, a potential source doublet\nand a stresslet. In the far-field, the stresslet is dominant, which results in the net \u2018leftward\u2019 and\n\u2018lifting\u2019 particle paths evident in Fig. 13. Redrawn from Blake and Chwang (1974).\nof chemical gradients. See, for example, Orme et al. (2001), which may be associ-\nated with symmetry-breaking mechanisms.\nThere are two ways to explain the generation of the nodal flow. As noted by\nBrokaw (2005), and used in the phenomenological model of Buceta et al. (2005),\nwe can consider the tilted rotation as consisting of an \u2018effective\u2019 and a \u2018recovery\u2019\nstroke as in \u20189 + 2\u2019 ciliary propulsion, which differ in propulsive effect due to the\nfact that the \u2018recovery\u2019 stroke takes place close to the boundary. An alternative\nperspective is to consider a steady rotlet representation, as used by Cartwright\net al. (2004), but include the image systems associated with the plane boundary, as\nfound by Blake and Chwang (1974) and shown in Fig. 14. Close to the axis of rota-\ntion, the particle paths resemble those around an infinite rotlet singularity, being\napproximately circular. In the far-field, the dominant singularity is the \u2018stresslet,\u2019\nwhich pushes fluid \u2018left\u2019 and \u2018up,\u2019 i.e. in the positive x1 and x3 directions on the\nleft of the node. This can be seen in the discrete cilia results of Fig. 11 for the\ntwo particles that escaped the array. With the appropriate image system, the rotlet\nrepresentation may be very useful in investigating the dynamics of fluid transport\nin the node. A steady representation suppresses the effect of cilia phase differ-\nence, but this does not significantly affect the transport of the particles that are not\ntrapped in a vortex. Phase difference or \u2018metachronism\u2019 (discussed for lung cilia in\nthe next section) is likely not a critical determinant of flow generation for the more\nwidely-spaced cilia of the embryonic node.\nIt should be noted that although the cilium tip moves faster than 100 \u00b5m\/s, the\nbulk of the nodal flow is approximately 1\u20133 \u00b5m\/s. This is because of the rapid\ndecay of the stresslet velocity field, which is O(1\/r2) due to the presence of the\nboundary. Because of this fast decay, cilia phase difference does not affect the\nmajority of particles, and so we suggest it is unlikely that any interaction or me-\nchanically induced metachronism could take place in the node.\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1495\nFuture modelling will take into account the upper boundary of the nodal cavity,\nalthough this is around 20 \u00b5m away and so will not have a dominant effect on the\nflow near the cilia (see Williams, 1966, where it is shown that the effect decays with\n1\/r), and the walls of the cavity. Accurate experimental data on cilia movement\n(see, for example Nonaka et al., 2005) may also be included. In the longer term,\ndetermining the response of mechanosensory cilia or morphogen chemicals to this\nfluid flow may be possible, which will help to determine which mechanisms may\nbe responsible for converting the fluid flow to asymmetric gene expression. Inves-\ntigation of possible chaotic regions may also be useful in determining the nature of\nchemical advection\u2013diffusion (Tang and Boozer, 1996).\nA question that we have not explored is the origin of the clockwise rotation.\nBefore the discovery of the nodal flow, Brown and Wolpert (1990) discussed the\nquestion of how molecular asymmetry could be converted to cellular asymme-\ntry. They suggested that handedness of certain cellular structures, including the\nmicrotubules that comprise primary cilia, may be involved in converting antero\u2013\nposterior and dorsal\u2013ventral asymmetry to a cellular level. By modelling the inter-\nnal force generation of the axoneme and coupling with a fluid mechanical model\nfor interaction with the surrounding liquid, Brokaw (2005) has investigated mech-\nanisms that may be responsible for the emergence of the chirality of cilium rota-\ntion, and the stability of the resulting chirality. The structural asymmetry of the\naxoneme, with dynein arms reaching in a clockwise direction from each tubule\ndoublet was found not to be sufficient to establish chirality. Rather, other physical\nmechanisms such as clockwise microtubule rotation or control of dynein activity\nby sliding velocity of an adjacent doublet were found to be plausible. Coupling\nthis modelling framework with consideration of the boundary effect, via the tech-\nniques described here is possible, and would provide a platform for the modelling\nof the interaction between cilia, the boundary and the flow field, in particular, pos-\nsible response of mechanosensory cilia that may transduce the directional flow\nfield.\n4. Airway surface liquid transport by cilia\nA topic of recent interest (Matsui et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2007) is the pericil-\niary liquid (PCL) transport in the airway surface liquid layer of the lung. In the\nfollowing sections, we derive a detailed model of the flow patterns in the peri-\nciliary layer that refines a previous model (Smith et al., 2006) of muco-ciliary\ntransport.\n4.1. The metachronal wave\nWe assume antiplectic metachronism, that is the metachronal wavefront propa-\ngates in the negative x1\u2013direction, the overlying mucus being transported in the\npositive x1\u2013direction. With this assumption, a cilium whose base is fixed at x1 = x\nwill be described by (x, 0, 0) + \u03be(s, kx\/\u03c3 + t), 0 < s < 1, where k is the wavenum-\nber 2\u03c0\/\u03bb, \u03c3\/2\u03c0 is the frequency and c = \u03c3\/k is the wavespeed. The plus sign be-\nfore the t indicates antiplectic metachronism. If we assume that the cilia have a\n1496 Smith et al.\nspacing a in the x1\u2013direction and b in the x2\u2013direction then the cilium at (ma, nb, 0)\nis described by\n\u03be \u2032mn(s, t) = (ma + \u03be1(s, \u03c4m), nb + \u03be2(s, \u03c4m), \u03be3(s, \u03c4m)) (15)\nwhere\n\u03c4m = kma\/\u03c3 + t, m, n = 0,\u00b11,\u00b12, . . . (16)\nBlake (1973); Fulford and Blake (1986b); Liron and Mochon (1976a) and Liron\n(1978) all modelled the cilia as line distributions of Stokeslets Sk only, whereas in\nlater sections we shall use the Stokeslet-dipole representation given by Eq. (9) in\nthe near field.\nSumming over the doubly infinite array of cilia represented by Stokeslet distri-\nbutions, we have Eq. (11),\nu(x, t) =\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\u2211\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\u222b 1\n0\nfk(\u03be \u2032mn(s\n\u2217, t))Sk(x, \u03be \u2032mn(s\n\u2217, t)) ds\u2217. (17)\nIt is not possible to solve the integral equation immediately, but there are various\nways to rearrange it into a more tractable form.\nAn elegant approach used by Blake (1972) and Liron and Mochon (1976a) is\nto make use of the periodicity of the cilia beat cycle and synchronisation in the x2\ndirection. After some manipulation, we have\nu(x, t) =\nm0\u22121\u2211\nr=0\n\u222b 1\n0\nfk(\u03be r (s\u2217, t))\n\u221e\u2211\nq=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e\nSk(x, \u03be \u2032qm0+r,n(s\n\u2217, t)) ds\u2217, (18)\nwhere there are m0 cilia per wavelength, and \u03be r (s\u2217, t) = \u03be(s\u2217, kra\/\u03c3 + t). Blake\n(1972) now exploited the Poisson summation formula to convert the double sum\ninto an exponentially decreasing series in the Fourier transformed Stokeslet. For\nmany problems, this is a very useful approach because finding the singular solu-\ntion for a particular domain involves first finding the Fourier-transformed ver-\nsion. Indeed, it may not in practice be possible to invert the transform. Possi-\nble applications of this might be the modelling of anisotropic liquids or porous\nmedia.\nInstead of using the Poisson summation formula, Liron and Mochon (1976a)\naveraged the velocity and the sum of singularities in the x2 direction. Due to syn-\nchronisation of the cilia in the x2 direction, we have, in the notation of Eq. (10) the\nvelocity u\u00af(x) averaged in the x2 direction:\nu\u00af(x) = 1\nb\nm0\u22121\u2211\nr=0\nI[x \u2212 rax\u02c61, \u03be r ; D, f], (19)\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1497\nwhere\nD(x, \u03be) =\n\u221e\u2211\nq=\u2212\u221e\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nS(x \u2212 \u03bbqx\u02c61, \u03be) dx2. (20)\nNote that we have again suppressed the dependence on t\u2014due to the assumption\nof metachronism, calculating the velocity field for one instant means that we auto-\nmatically have the velocity field for times t \u00b1 rT\/m0 for r = \u00b11, 2, . . . The kernel\nD must be calculated for the appropriate domain from S, as for the semi-infinite\ndomain in Liron and Mochon (1976a) and the confined domain in Liron (1978).\n4.2. Pressure gradient\nLiron (1978) observed that, due to the periodic boundary conditions in his prob-\nlem, the solution was non-unique\u2014an arbitrary constant pressure gradient could\nbe added. As discussed in Smith et al. (2007), a subject of great interest is the\ntransport of PCL in cultures that exhibit circular mucus transport, as described in\nMatsui et al. (1998). In such a system, no constant pressure gradient can be present,\ndue to the fact that the pressure must be continuously moving around the culture.\nIt should be noted that additional local variations in pressure due to osmotic fluxes\nmay be present, as would be predicted from the Isotonic Volume Hypothesis of\nBoucher (1994). For now, we shall not consider the effect of a pressure gradient,\nalthough it is possible that in vivo such an effect may be important.\n4.3. Modelling an infinite metachronal array of cilia between two parallel plates\nIn Liron (1996), it is argued that the averaging technique of Eq. (20) is by no means\naccurate, since the variations of S(x, \u03be \u2032m0(s, t)) in x2 for x close to \u03be\n\u2032\nm0(s, t) are signif-\nicant. Liron calculated exponentially decreasing forms of the doubly-infinite sums\nof the Stokeslets as a remedy for this. An alternative approach is to retain the exact\nform of the near-field singularities and perform the averaging in the far-field only.\nBy not averaging in the near-field, we also can check that the boundary condition\ndiscussed in Section 2.3 is satisfied by the solution. We shall work in the confined\ndomain, using the Stokeslet SCk . As before, we start with the doubly-infinite field\nof cilia.

A new model for the flow in the periciliary layer\nA model for cilia beating in a domain bounded by two flat plates was first proposed\nby Blake (1973) for approximating a ciliated tubule such as the ductus efferentes\nof the male reproductive tract. He suggested taking the single plate solution he\nhad developed previously near each plate, then connecting the solution by a flat or\nparabolic profile. Liron and Mochon (1976b) gave the analytical solution that we\ndenote SCjk, expressed in terms of Hankel transforms, and an alternative version in\nterms of exponentially decreasing series. Unfortunately, for y close to the walls of\nthe domain, these forms of the solution decay quite slowly, making computation\nmore time consuming. A remedy was provided by Staben et al. (2003) who found\nthat the slowly-decaying parts of the integrands are given by the infinite domain\nStokeslet plus the image corrections in each wall Swallijk found by Blake (1971). The\nremaining part of the singularity is given in terms of rapidly decaying Hankel inte-\ngrals on (0,\u221e), so that we have\nSCjk = S\u221ejk + Swall0jk + Swall1jk + SHankeljk . (24)\nA very useful technical maneuver when applying the refined discretisation tech-\nnique of Eq. (8) is to notice that only the first three terms may be singular near the\npoint of evaluation and hence rapidly varying. The SHankeljk term will not be rapidly\nvarying and, hence, it is only necessary to evaluate the lengthy integrals defining\nSHankeljk at the single point in each segment si . If speed of implementation is an issue,\nit may also be useful to exploit the analytics of Higdon (1979), who evaluated S\u221ejk in\nthe region close to the singular point. Other analytical techniques based on regu-\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1499\nlarised Stokeslets have recently been used by Tornberg and Shelley (2004), for the\nproblem of simulating multiple interacting slender bodies with coupled elasticity.\nWe shall use the concept of a fluid between two parallel plates to represent the\nPCL. The mucous boundary, which remains relatively flat and is almost solid com-\npared to the PCL is hence modelled as a flat no-slip boundary. We argue that this\nis a good approximation because \u2018. . . cilia encounter mucus as a solid . . .\u2019 (Salathe\net al., 1997) and \u2018. . . the response of the mucous layer lying on top of the bed of\nbeating cilia is that of a semi-solid sheet . . .\u2019 (Meyer and Silberberg, 1980). In order\nto accommodate the movement of the mucous layer, we again exploit the linearity\nof the Stokes flow equation by adding a time-dependent shear-driven flow given\nby the traction layer model of Smith et al. (2006). This phenomenological model\ncaptured most of the main physical effects and interaction of the PCL and mucous\nlayer, but did not model the detailed flow patterns around the cilia in the PCL. In\norder to investigate this, we combine the mucous layer movement with the cilia-\ninduced flow to provide a higher level of detail on the flow in the PCL.\nThe ciliated plate, representing the epithelium, is at x3 = 0, the moving plate,\nrepresenting the mucous layer, is at x3 = L. We split the total velocity u into two\nparts, u = u(1) + u(2), where u(1) is the solution for shear\u2013driven flow, discussed in\nSection 4.5.\nAt present, we assume that the epithelium is impermeable, corresponding to the\nboundary condition that u = v = 0 on x3 = 0. This is consistent with the hypotonic\ndefensin hypothesis discussed in Smith et al. (2006). As discussed in Section 5.2,\nit will be an important topic for future work to model flow produced by transep-\nithelial fluxes. It may also be important to modify the singularities used to take\ninto account possible slip at the epithelial surface, or even porosity of the mucous\nlayer.\n4.5. Shear-driven flow\nIn this section, we describe the fluid flow u(1) that represents the effect of the mu-\ncous layer moving in contact with the PCL. The fluid is stationary at the epithelium,\nso that u(1) = 0 at y = 0. At y = 1, we use the velocity calculated for the traction\nlayer numerical model in Smith et al. (2006), at the level of the mucus\u2013PCL inter-\nface. The component of u(1) into the paper was neglected for the 2D model traction\nlayer model, we take it to be zero. With the above boundary conditions, we solve\nthe Stokes equations in order to calculate the shear-driven flow u(1). Details are\ngiven in Appendix A. The calculated velocity field u(1) is shown as a quiver plot in\nFig. 15.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n0\n0.5\n1\nx1\nx3\nFig. 15 Fluid velocity vectors for the shear-driven flow u(1) only.

(8). Once the force distribution is\nfound, the fluid velocity at any position x may be found from Eq. (26).\n4.7. Results\nFigure 16 shows velocity field solutions for our model at different points along\nthe ciliary beat at time t = 0, for 50 cilia per wavelength. The beat cycle quanti-\nfied by Fulford and Blake (1986b), taken from the data of Sanderson and Sleigh\n(1981), was used. It was necessary to choose the metachronal wavelength to be\nm0a = 15L = 90 \u00b5m, rather longer than the value of 30 \u00b5m quoted by Fulford\nand Blake (1986b). This length was chosen to prevent the cilia from \u2018intersecting.\u2019\nIn the real system, the cilia would be likely to slip past each other. However, our\nslender body model is not designed for the situation in which the cilia approach\nthis closely. Figure 17 shows that the boundary conditions on the cilium at the\norigin are approximately satisfied, although due to the greater cilium density, the\nresults are not as accurate as the single cilium model shown in Fig. 6. The spacing\nbetween cilium centres is 1.8 \u00b5m, in the lungs the spacing will be of the order of\n0.3 \u00b5m; however, our model provides an improved indication of the flows in the\ndensely ciliated system of the airway.\nComparing the results with Fig. 15, it is notable that the cilia do not have a\nsignificant effect on the flow field except very near the cilium axis. The flow is\ndominated by shear-driven flow originating in the mucous layer. This is even more\nclear from the plot in Fig. 18.\nFigure 19 shows the flow profile in the region between the cilia tips and the\nmucous layer. It is interesting to note that the backward movement of the cilia\ntips does not cause a backward flow of fluid, but rather the PCL flows forward\nwith the mucous layer. The gap between the cilia tips and the mucus interface\nwas not modelled in Smith et al. (2006), which predicted very small transport of\nPCL. Our results presented here suggest that there could be substantial transport\nof PCL in this gap. As for the embryonic cilia results, the velocity induced by a\nmoving cilium decays rapidly, due to the 1\/r2 far-fields found by Blake (1971) and\nLiron (1978).\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1501\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14\n00.1\n0\n0.5\n1\nx1\nx3\n0 0.5\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.5 2\n2.5 3\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n4 4.5\n5 5.5\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n6.5 7\n7.5 8\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n9 9.5\n10 10.5\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n11.5 12\n12.5 13\n0\n0.05\n0.1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\nFig. 16 Top\u2014a line of cilia over one wavelength, with the beat cycle discretised by Fulford and\nBlake (1986b) from the micrographs of Sanderson and Sleigh (1981).

Our results are very acceptably consistent with the boundary conditions\non the cilia, and include the effect of viscoelastic mucus movement, using the phe-\nnomenological modelling results of Smith et al. (2006). The fluid flow is dominated\nby the shear-driven flow produced by the moving mucous layer, cilia only reversing\nthe fluid flow in a region of approximately 0.2 \u00b5m in radius, the cilium radius be-\ning 0.1 \u00b5m. Our main conclusion is that there is a significant forward flow of PCL\nin the gap between the cilium tips and the mucus interface. It was not possible to\nmake definitive conclusions regarding the mean flux of PCL due to the fact that\nintegrating the errors in the singularity distributions over the fluid volume would\nnot be acceptably accurate. It will be necessary to carry out simulations with the\ncilium spacing reduced to a more biologically accurate value of as little as 0.3 \u00b5m\nin order to make make definitive conclusions regarding the effect of the cilia on the\nflow in the PCL. Improved slender body theory for the case of closely approaching\ncilia will be instrumental in this.\n0\n0\n0.1\n0\n0.5\n1\nFig. 18 Fluid velocity vectors on the line x1 = \u03be1(0.5, 0), 0 < x2 < b\/2, x3 = \u03be3(0.5, 0) during the\nrecovery stroke.

An alter-\nnative approach would be to use the doubly-infinite arrays of Stokeslets calculated\nby Liron (1996), which are in the form of exponentially decreasing doubly-infinite\nseries. However, this would still involve a very substantial computation. In partic-\nular, the present approach allowed us to make use of the simplification of Staben\net al. (2003) in the evaluation of the point force singularity.\nIt will be very informative to find out whether the PCL flux for a very dense mat\nof cilia is indeed as small as was estimated in Smith et al. (2006), although the posi-\ntive flux above the cilia tips during the recovery stroke suggests that this is unlikely.\nIn order to determine the PCL flux accurately, one could pursue an exact Bound-\nary Integral Equation approach, or the Immersed Boundary Method that has been\nused successfully to model flagellar beating and cilia interaction (for a recent re-\nview, see Fauci and Dillon, 2006). Such approaches consider the cilia as elastic\nsurfaces rather than simply one-dimensional lines. However, as discussed below,\nthey are necessarily more computationally expensive. A study examining the flux\nthrough a small array of cilia using such techniques may be very informative.\n5. Biological applications of discrete cilia modelling\nand the singularity technique\n5.1. Scope of the singularity technique\nA number of current research areas in biology require an understanding of the\ndetailed nature of flow fields produced by, and possibly sensed by, eukaryotic cilia\nand flagella. Such flows may be difficult to visualise through tracer experiments\ndue to the small length scales involved (Smith et al., 2007). By using the slender\nbody modelling algorithms developed here, which draw on the work of Chwang\nand Wu (1975) and Liron (1978), it is possible to accurately represent the cilia\nas discrete bodies, and to simulate flow patterns produced in a Newtonian liquid\nby 50 or more cilia, or periodic arrays, with dominant boundary effects such as the\nepithelium or an upper mucous layer included in a natural way. It is also possible to\nperform particle tracking for time-dependent problems such as non-metachronal\ncilia in the embryonic node. Being able to determine the cilia-driven fluid flow in\nsuch systems as the embryonic node, or in the folds of the oviduct is crucial to\nbiological understanding of chemical or mechanical signalling systems. For many\n1504 Smith et al.\nsystems, the most crucial challenge in applying the technique in a physiologically\naccurate way is taking account of closely-spaced cilia.\nIn simulating cilia as discrete objects, the singularity method offers advantages\nover both local Gray & Hancock-type \u2018resistance coefficient\u2019 models, in that accu-\nracy is far greater, and over highly accurate Boundary Integral Equation meth-\nods. By representing the cilia by one-dimensional line integrals, computational\nefficiency is greater. Boundary Integral Equation methods have greater versatil-\nity in their ability to represent non-slender and irregular boundaries, and closely\nspaced cilia, and Immersed Boundary Methods may be used to represent all man-\nner of complex and realistic fluid properties. However, these techniques may still\ninvolve prohibitive computational cost when modelling large numbers of cilia, or\nsystems where assumptions of periodicity are not possible. Extending singularity\nmodelling to a wider class of problems is, hence, an important subject for future\nwork. We also suggest that hybrid models that exploit the accuracy of Boundary\nIntegral Equation methods in the near-field, together with highly efficient slender\nbody representations for cilia in the far-field may be fruitful.\nIn systems such as the embryonic node, where spatially averaged \u2018volume force\u2019\nassumptions are inappropriate, the discrete cilia technique is by far the best\nmethod of determining fluid flow. In the muco-ciliary system, such volume force\nmodels (Smith et al., 2006) are more appropriate, but discrete cilia modelling can\ndetermine subtleties that may be missing from volume force modelling, such as the\npositive fluid transport above the cilia tips during the recovery stroke. We strongly\nargue that the singularity technique is the method of choice for modelling oscilla-\ntory flow in the embryonic node. It offers both realistic physics and temporal detail\nin a way that is still easy to implement numerically.\nFinally, it is timely and important to re-visit the mechanics of oviductal cilia,\nwhich motivated the original study of Liron (1978). A topic of considerable current\ninterest in human and mammalian reproductive biology is the role of chemotaxis\nand\/or thermotaxis in guiding sperm to the egg or indeed selecting sperm for fertili-\nsation (Eisenbach and Giojalas, 2006). In vitro experiments may involve examining\nthe response of sperm to artificial chemical or thermal gradients. However, it is not\nclear how such gradients relate to the in vivo situation where ciliary mixing may\nbe important (Fauci and Dillon, 2006). For example, cilia-driven oscillations can\nobliterate chemical concentration gradients in airway surface liquid (Smith et al.,\n2007). The singularity technique may be the method of choice for calculating the\noscillatory flow field. Certain difficulties arise in formulating a model: at present\nthere do not appear to be detailed measurements of cilia density, beat pattern or\nmetachronism at different locations along the mammalian oviduct, as exist for the\nlung. Towards the fimbral end of the oviduct, the geometry is rather tortuous and\ncomplex, but nearer the utero-tubular junction it is closer to a cylindrical tubule,\nwhich is closer to the problem considered by Liron (1978). Finally, ciliated cells are\ninterspersed by mucus-secreting cells. It is, therefore, necessary to determine the\nrheological properties of the oviductal fluid, and whether cilia\u2013mucus interaction\ntakes place.\nThe videos of Talbot et al. (1999) show dramatically the process of cumulus\u2013\noocyte complex \u2018pickup\u2019 and transport by oviductal cilia. The precise mechan-\nics of the interaction between cilia and the viscoelastic cumulus have not been\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1505\ninvestigated. We speculate that the tips of the cilia will engage with cumulus only\nduring the effective stroke, as for the muco-ciliary system of the lung. Hence,\noviductal cilia may exhibit two very different functions\u2014the mixing of oviductal\nfluid, and the directional transport of viscoelastic cumulus.\n5.2. Future developments\nBelow we outline a number of areas in which the singularity technique may be\nextended to give greater insight into various biological problems.\n\u0001 Slip conditions and porous epithelia: Future work may also consider the role of\n\u2018slip\u2019 in microfluidics, as discussed recently by Lauga et al. (2005), or even fluid\nboundaries such as mucus that may act as porous media. How does possible slip\non a ciliated surface, or a surface near a swimming organism modify flow gen-\neration, swimming speed or efficiency? Cells possessing primary cilia are gener-\nally covered in short, dense microvilli (see, for example, the images of Hagiwara\net al., 2002). A slip condition may be an appropriate boundary condition on the\n\u2018surface\u2019 of the microvilli. In the case of muco-ciliary transport in the liquid lining\nof the lung, the inclusion of porous medium effects to simulate epithelial perme-\nability may assist with bringing theoretical modelling into closer correspondence\nwith biological understanding (see, for example Matsui et al., 1998, 2000; Smith\net al., 2007).\n\u0001 Closely approaching cilia: Bartha and Liron (1988b) used the asymptotic tech-\nniques of Johnson (1980) to consider the interaction of two slender bodies ei-\nther in an unbounded fluid, or near a wall. They found asymptotically accurate\nsecond-kind integral equations for the force distributions and drag on each body,\nsubject to their separation being of the order of the cilium length. It would be\nvery useful to determine whether such techniques could work for bodies with\nseparation of a small multiple of their slenderness, as is likely to be the case in\ncertain physiological systems such as the lung, oviduct and even stereocilia in the\ncochlea. As discussed above, a hybrid approach may be optimal.\n\u0001 Mechanosensing of slender filaments: Gueron and Levit-Gurevich (2001) have\nalso recently considered 3D flow due to arrays of cilia. Moreover, they have\ncoupled modelling of the internal 9 + 2 structure and bend generation with the\nfluid dynamics of the LGL Theorem discussed earlier, and the 3D kinematics of\nthe motion of a slender filament. Their approach shows how for relatively large\narrays of cilia (up to 25 were used in their study) one can investigate the emer-\ngence of ciliary coordination for three-dimensional flow. The authors noted that\nthis has applications to a number of biological systems, to which we would like\nto add the investigation of the bending of mechanosensory cilia to sense fluid\nflow in the embryonic node. It is also possible that airway cilia transduce shear\nstress from airflow, which has been shown to have a very significant effect on\nmechanisms that control ASL depth (Tarran et al., 2006). Discrete cilia mod-\nelling could be used to quantify whether such stresses would be significant in\nthe presence of the considerable stresses caused by nearby motile cilia, and to\ndetermine the amount of stress on the underlying epithelium.\n1506 Smith et al.\n\u0001 Flagellar propulsion: The singularity technique for a slender body used in this pa-\nper has much in common with the flagellar propulsion model of Higdon (1979),\nsome important differences being that modelling free-swimming bodies involves\nan additional force and moment balance, and that Higdon performed an ana-\nlytical integral for the singularity in the near-field. With present computational\ntechniques, this latter maneuver is not required, and furthermore we can con-\nsider a more sophisticated singularity representation that takes into account\nplane boundaries and a more realistic beat of the tail. A vital future step in the\nmodelling of sperm will be to integrate Higdon\u2019s classic framework with more\naccurate representations of the head and boundary geometries that motile cells\nencounter in vivo, and to extend these techniques to take into account the rhe-\nology of fluids such as cervical mucus. An initial study involving the latter has\nbeen done by Fulford et al. (1998).\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank the faculty and students at the Cystic Fibro-\nsis\/Pulmonary Research and Treatment Center and the Department of Applied\nMathematics, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill for valuable discussions\nregarding airway surface liquid transport.

In what follows, we omit the subscripts.\nFor n = 0 we have\nd2u\ndy2\n= 0, (A.1)\nand for n \u2265 1\n\u2212 2\u03c0np\u02c7i = \u2212\u03c72u\u02c7r + d\n2u\u02c7r\ndy2\n, 2\u03c0np\u02c7r = \u2212\u03c72u\u02c7i + d\n2u\u02c7i\ndy\n,\nDiscrete Cilia Modelling with Singularity Distributions: Application 1507\nd2 p\u02c7r\ndy2\n= \u2212\u03c72\t2v\u02c7r + \t2 d\n2v\u02c7r\ndy2\n,\nd p\u02c7i\ndy\n= \u2212\u03c72\t2v\u02c7i + \t2 d\n2v\u02c7i\ndy2\n, (A.2)\nalong with the differentiated continuity equations\n\u2212 2\u03c0ndu\u02c7\ni\ndy\n+ d\n2v\u02c7r\ndy2\n= 0, 2\u03c0ndu\u02c7\nr\ndy\n+ d\n2v\u02c7i\ndy2\n= 0, (A.3)\nwhere \t = L\/\u03bb and \u03c7 = 2\u03c0nL\/\u03bb.\nThe flow is determined by the boundary conditions on y = 0 and y = 1. On\ny = 0, assuming the epithelium is impermeable, we have u = v = 0. On y = 1,\nwe use the interface velocity calculated in Smith et al. (2006), with horizontal\nand vertical components utl(x, t) =\n\u221115\nn=0 Rl{(u\u02c7rtl n + i u\u02c7itl n)ein(kx+\u03c3 t)} and vtl(x, t) =\u221115\nn=0 Rl{(v\u02c7rtl n + i v\u02c7itl n) ein(kx+\u03c3 t)}.\nFor n = 0, assuming no steady pressure gradient as in Smith et al. (2006), we\nhave the shear-driven flow solution\nu(y) = utl 0 yL. (A.4)\nFor n \u2265 1, we rewrite this as a system of 10 first-order ODEs\u2014from the six equa-\ntions above and four definition equations\u2014in 10 variables. Primes denote differ-\nentiation with respect to y.\nZ1 = u\u02c7r Z6 = p\u02c7i\nZ2 = u\u02c7i Z7 = \u22122\u03c0nu\u02c7i + v\u02c7r \u2032\nZ3 = v\u02c7r Z8 = \u22122\u03c0nu\u02c7i + v\u02c7r \u2032\nZ4 = v\u02c7i Z9 = u\u02c7r \u2032\nZ5 = p\u02c7r \u2032 Z10 = u\u02c7i \u2032.\nThe field equations are then written as\nZ \u20321 = Z9 Z \u20326 = \u2212\u03c72\t2 Z4 \u2212 2\u03c0n\t2 Z9\nZ \u20322 = Z10 Z \u20327 = 0\nZ \u20323 = 2\u03c0nZ2 + Z7 Z \u20328 = 0\nZ \u20324 = \u22122\u03c0nZ1 + Z8 Z \u20329 = \u03c72 Z1 \u2212 2\u03c0nZ6\nZ \u20325 = \u2212\u03c72\t2 Z3 + 2\u03c0n\t2 Z10 Z \u203210 = \u03c72 Z2 + 2\u03c0nZ5.\nThe boundary conditions are written as\nZ1 = 0\nZ1 = u\u02c7rtl n Z2 = 0\nZ2 = u\u02c7itl n Z3 = 0\nZ3 = v\u02c7rtl n Z4 = 0\nZ4 = v\u02c7itl n (y = 1), Z7 = \u22122\u03c0nu\u02c7i + v\u02c7r \u2032\nZ8 = \u22122\u03c0nu\u02c7i + v\u02c7r \u2032 (y = 0).\n1508 Smith et al.\nThis system is solved numerically using the NAG routine D02GBF.\nReferences\nBartha, E., Liron, N., 1988a.
