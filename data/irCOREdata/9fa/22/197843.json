Introduction \n \nWhat contextual factors impact on the success of HIV-prevention in schools? What are the \nmost appropriate strategies for creating contexts that support the success of schools-based \nefforts to reduce HIV-transmission? Young people are worst affected by HIV\/AIDS, and \nmuch energy is being put into interventions to reduce youth HIV-transmission. Increasingly \nattempts are being made to integrate interventions into schools-based curricula and activities. \nSuch interventions have had very variable successes. However, our ability to learn \ngeneralisable lessons from these patchy outcomes is limited by the lack of comprehensive \ntheoretical frameworks conceptualising the array of multi-level factors that prevent or hinder \nthe likelihood of health-enhancing behaviour change (MacPhail and Campbell, 1999; Waldo \nand Coates, 2000). Historically, research has tended to focus on two levels of analysis. At the \nmicro-level, studies have sought to explain and predict sexual behaviour and the possibility \nof behaviour change in terms of individual-level properties, such as HIV-related knowledge, \nattitudes and behavioural intentions. At the macro-level, efforts have been made to explain \nhigh levels of HIV amongst young people in terms of features of the wider social \nenvironment, e.g. gender and poverty. However, less research has focused on the processes \nintervening between micro- and macro-levels of analysis, particularly at the local community \nlevel. In this paper we argue that there is an urgent need for theoretical renewal in the field of \nHIV-prevention research, particularly in relation to identifying those community-level \nrelationships that enable or restrain the possibility of programme success. \n \nIn this paper, a \u2018community\u2019 is defined as a group of people who live and\/or work in a \ncommon geographical place. Whilst it is often argued that \u2018communities\u2019 are better defined \nas \u2018communities of interest\u2019 (e.g. the Christian community) than \u2018communities of place\u2019 (e.g. \nthe residents of Summertown), for reasons related to pragmatism and resources, health-\nrelated community development projects usually focus their energies on geographically \nbounded spaces. For this reason, this is the definition preferred here. The concept of local \ncommunity mobilisation plays a key role in HIV\/AIDS management strategies world-wide, \n 3 \nencompassing strategies such as participatory peer education and multi-stakeholder \npartnerships (UN AIDS, 1999, 2001). Yet despite the popularity of such strategies, much \nremains to be learned about the types of social relationships that community mobilisation \nshould be seeking to promote, the processes underlying the impact of local community \nmobilisation on sexual health, and factors that promote or hinder such mobilisation \n(Campbell, forthcoming). This undermines our ability to learn lessons from the proliferation \nof variously successful community mobilisation efforts in the HIV-prevention field. \n \nThree approaches to HIV-prevention \n \nEarly HIV-prevention research focused overwhelmingly on the individual level of analysis, \nusually using KAB (knowledge-attitudes-behaviours) conceptual frameworks. These assume \nthat HIV\/AIDS-related knowledge and attitudes play an important role in shaping peoples\u2019 \nsexual behaviour. KAB-type frameworks underpinned the first generation of HIV-prevention \ninterventions. These sought to increase knowledge and change attitudes through traditional \ndidactic information-based health education. However, such approaches have had limited \nsuccess in promoting behaviour change. It is now generally accepted that knowledge and \nattitudes are very weak determinants of behaviour (Joffe, 1996).  \n \nAgainst this background it was argued that programmes should seek to change not only \nknowledge and attitudes, but also to provide people with the behavioural skills needed for \nhealthier behaviours, and to increase peoples\u2019 confidence in their ability to perform healthier \nbehaviours. This led to the second series of HIV-prevention programmes, namely self-\nempowerment approaches (see Marks et al., 1999 for a discussion of various health \npromotional approaches). These taught people behavioural skills such as how to put on \ncondoms, and how to negotiate condom use with a reluctant partner. They also sought to \ndevelop peoples\u2019 confidence through strategies such as assertiveness training courses. Such \napproaches are said to have underpinned the success of HIV-prevention in organised, strong \nidentity groups in more affluent countries (e.g. the gay community in San Francisco). \nHowever they have had less luck in less cohesive or organised groups \u2013 and in low income \ncountries. In the latter contexts it is argued that whilst such programmes may motivate \nindividuals to make decisions to engage in safe behaviour in the context of an intervention \n 4 \nworkshop, social norms, constructed in conditions of poverty and gender inequalities, make it \ndifficult for them to act on these decisions in real-life relationships  \n \nThis insight has been associated with the growing popularity of a third series of HIV-\nprevention approaches. These target the peer group or community rather than the individual. \nPeer education is based on the assumption that peers are the most important influence on \nyoung peoples\u2019 sexual behaviour, and that they are most likely to change their behaviour if \nthey see liked and trusted peers are changing theirs (Dube and Wilson, 1999; Ngugi et al., \n1996). Young people are trained in factual knowledge about HIV and participatory \neducational techniques (e.g. drama\u2019s, role plays). They are also given free supplies of \ncondoms to distribute. Ideally, they are given full control of setting up and running peer \neducational meetings in formal and informal settings.  \n \nConceptual underpinnings of peer and community level approaches \n \nWhilst peer and community level approaches are extremely popular in the world of practice, \nour conceptual understandings of the mechanisms whereby they have their effects are in their \ninfancy. Peer education has been referred to as a \u2018method in search of a theory\u2019 (Turner and \nShepherd, 1999, p. 236). One reason for its patchy successes is the dearth of conceptual \nframeworks to inform the design and evaluation of programmes. Campbell (forthcoming) \nbegins to point to some of the processes underlying successful peer education. Firstly peer \neducation succeeds to the extent that it provides the contexts in which peers can collectively \nrenegotiate their social identities, on the assumption that sexuality is shaped by peer norms as \nmuch as by individual decisions. Secondly peer education should empower young people in \ntwo ways. It should provide them with confidence and negotiation skills, as well as a sense of \nownership of health information and health interventions (traditionally the province of \nmedical experts). Such a sense of \u2018youth ownership\u2019 of the problem of HIV is regarded as a \nkey dimension of the motivation young people would require to act on combating it. This \ncombination of confidence, negotiating skills and ownership ideally contributes to a sense of \nincreased self-efficacy amongst young people, which increased the likelihood that they will \nfeel in control of their health. Equally importantly, peer education should empower youth \nthrough teaching them to think critically about obstacles to behaviour change. According to \n 5 \nFreire\u2019s (1973) concept of critical consciousness, participatory educational approaches have \nthe greatest chance of succeeding if participants have a sound understanding of the social \nfactors which stand in the way of behaviour change. This enables peers to collectively \n\u2018brainstorm\u2019 ways in which they might act to undermine the impact of such factors. \n  \nHowever, successful peer education programmes need to aim for more than the renegotiation \nof identities, and the development of empowered and critically conscious youth peer groups. \nThey also need to contribute to the development of \u2018health-enabling community contexts\u2019 \n(Tawil et al., 1995, p. 1299) that enable and support these processes. The task of \nconceptualising and promoting such contexts is currently the key challenges facing HIV-\nprevention researchers and activists. The remainder of this paper provides an overview of \ncurrent research, policy and intervention thinking in this area, in order to point towards gaps \nin current thinking, and towards an expanded agenda for youth HIV-prevention research. In \nthe paper\u2019s concluding section, it will be argued that the concept of social capital provides a \ntentative starting point for beginning to fill these gaps, although much work remains to be \ndone in developing this concept.  \n \nSummertown case study \n \nThe question as to how best to define and promote the development of communities that \nenable peer educational success has been raised in a recent case study of a peer education \nprogramme led by young people in Summertown, a gold mining community near \nJohannesburg, where levels of youth HIV are high (Summertown is a pseudonym for our area \nof interest). A baseline study (MacPhail and Campbell, 2001), conducted before the peer \neducation programme was initiated, highlighted how youth continued to engage in high risk \nsex, despite good knowledge about HIV\/AIDS and how to prevent it. Focus groups suggested \nthat the following factors contributed to the spread of HIV\/AIDS: low levels of perceived \nrisk; peer pressure for unprotected sex; limited availability of condoms in a context where \nclinic staff were often hostile to young people, especially women, seeking condoms; and \neconomic factors which made transactional sex a survival option for some young women. All \nthese factors were located within the context of gender norms which placed boys under \npressure to have frequent unprotected sex, and which limited girls\u2019 power and sometimes \n 6 \ntheir willingness to insist on condom use. The authors concluded that traditional information-\nbased sexual health education was unlikely to have any impact in the absence of efforts to \npromote health-enabling community contexts \u2013 to support the performance of safer sex by \nyoung people. \n \nFollowing this baseline study, the researchers conducted a case study of a schools-based peer \neducation and condom distribution programme (Campbell and MacPhail, 2002). This \nprogramme was part of a larger community-wide HIV prevention intervention in \nSummertown, including biomedical STI control, community-led peer education and condom \ndistribution and multi-stakeholder project management (see Campbell, forthcoming, for a \ndiscussion of the larger study). The study identified various obstacles to the development of \nyouth empowerment and critical thinking that the authors argued were essential preconditions \nfor programme success. \n \nAt the level of programme delivery, the highly regulated nature of the school environment \nmilitated against the development of autonomous critical thinking by learners. Rigid teacher \ncontrol of the programme undermined any sense of \u2018youth ownership\u2019 of its activities and \ngoals. Youth had been schooled in a tradition of didactic teaching methods, which meant that \nneither peer educators nor their target groupings were familiar with the participatory and \ninteractive methods that characterise the critical thinking underpinning successful peer \neducation. Peer educators were more comfortable focusing on biomedical aspects of \nHIV\/AIDS than the social aspects, further undermining the development of critical thinking \nskills. Youth peer education activities tended to be male-dominated, replicating the very \ngender dynamics the programme should ideally have challenged. Finally learner attitudes to \nthe programme, within the context of the stigmatisation of HIV\/AIDS, also greatly \nundermined programme efforts. \n \nThe study also focused on aspects of learners\u2019 beyond school environments that undermined  \nprogramme success. Limited opportunities for communication about sex with peers and \nsexual partners  undermined the ease with which programme participants could transfer the \nlessons they had learned into their daily social and sexual lives. So did limited opportunities \nfor communication with adults about sex, and parental denial of youth sexuality and of the \ndangers of the HIV\/AIDS epidemic. Young people are less likely to take sexual risks when \n 7 \nthey grow up amongst adults who feel comfortable talking about sex and relationships \n(Aggleton and Campbell, 2000). Adults generally offered poor role models of sexual \nrelationships, with young people often having had little first hand contact with adults who \nrelated to their sexual partners in an egalitarian or co-operative way. Finally young peoples\u2019 \nlives were blighted by macro-social environments characterised by poverty, lack of \neducational opportunities and unemployment. These undermined their confidence and their \nsense of personal agency to take control of their lives in general, or their sexual health in \nparticular. \n \nThe authors conclude that many of these problems cannot be addressed by schools-based \nprogrammes in a vacuum. Providing young people with HIV-related information and \nbehavioural skills is not enough. Programmes also need to work towards creating social and \ncommunity contexts that enable and support young people to act on this information and to \nput these behavioural skills into practice. Two forms of community mobilisation are \nincreasingly seen as key strategies for creating health-enabling community contexts. The first \nis grassroots participation of target audience members in the design and implementation of \nprogrammes. However this is not enough. Often, those most vulnerable to HIV infection are \nalso those with the least access to the political influence and material resources that may be \nnecessary for them to achieve programme goals. Against this background, grassroots \nparticipation needs to be backed up with a second community mobilisation strategy, viz: the \ncreation of \u2018partnerships\u2019 or \u2018alliances\u2019 between peer education networks and more powerful \ngroupings, locally, nationally and internationally (Gillies, 1998). In the original project \nproposal, the Summertown HIV-prevention programme sought to address these problems \nthrough creating partnerships between peer educational groups and more powerful groupings \nfrom civil society and the public and private sectors. The peer education programme \ndiscussed above was to have been integrally linked to a wider multi-stakeholder HIV-\nprevention programme in Summertown that would draw peer educator representatives into \nsuch local partnerships. However, in practice, as discussed below, a variety of reasons \nhindered the effectiveness of the partnerships between Summertown stakeholders, with low \nlevels of school peer educator participation in the stakeholder process being one of the \nproject\u2019s disappointments. \n  \n 8 \nSmall-scale community projects are most likely to succeed if they are located within the \ncontext of supportive local and national government policies (Evans, 1996; Woolcock, 1998). \nAs discussed below, the South African government has done important groundwork in laying \ndown health, educational and social development policies that, if fully implemented, would \nprovide invaluable support for schools-based peer education efforts (Harrison et al., 2000). \nHowever, as was the case in Summertown, many obstacles stand in the way of the practical \nimplementation of potentially excellent policies in the South African schools context. \n  \nIt is against this background the Summertown experience suggests there is an urgent need for \nresearch which furthers our understandings of: (i) contextual influences on the success or \nfailure of participatory peer educational programmes in schools; (ii) the types of partnerships \nneeded to facilitate contexts that are supportive of schools-based peer education; (iii) factors \nwhich promote or hinder the development of such partnerships; and (iv) factors which \npromote or hinder the practical implementation of sound government policies in applied \ncontexts within schools. \n \n2. Empirical research on contextual influences on peer education \n \nTo what extent are these issues already addressed in the academic literature on youth peer \neducation? A literature search used various combinations of the words \u2018peer education\u2019, \n\u2018HIV\/AIDS\u2019, \u2018partnerships\u2019, \u2018advocacy\u2019 and \u2018youth or young people\u2019 drawing on (i) \nPubMed\/ MEDLINE; (ii) the International Bibliography of the Social Sciences; and (iii) the \nabstracts from the 2002 international AIDS conference in Barcelona. Attention was confined \nto studies in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly South Africa. Numerous articles focused on \ncontextual influences on programme success or failure. However, whilst reference was \nfrequently made to the need to establish partnerships as a strategy for supporting schools-\nbased programmes, this was usually made in passing. There was virtually no account of the \ntypes of partnerships that would be most appropriate, or of factors that would facilitate or \nhinder their development. Furthermore, whilst the importance of supportive school or \ngovernment policy was alluded to in passing, not one paper focused explicitly on the role of \npolicy in supporting peer education, or on obstacles to policy implementation within schools. \n 9 \nBelow we categorise articles dealing with factors influencing programme success or failure to \nprovide a flavour of the issues currently being researched. \nDesign of peer education programmes \nNeglect of gender in youth HIV-prevention material \nSeveral articles emphasised that youth-focused peer education materials were unlikely to \nhave any impact because they did not specifically deal with gender. In a six-country study \nMannathoko (2002) referred to the \u2018wall of silence\u2019 about the role of gender and sexuality in \nfuelling the epidemic, impeding meaningful discussion about HIV between parents and \nchildren, teachers and students, and boyfriends and girlfriends. Morrell, et al. (2001) in South \nAfrica, and Schatz and Dzvimbo (2001) in Zimbabwe show how failure to take account of \nthe irreducibly gendered nature of sexuality and sexual health undermine the likelihood that \nprevention messages will resonate with learners\u2019 personal experiences of sex. \n \nLack of knowledge about factors affecting the effectiveness of peer education \nThere is a pressing need for documenting and sharing the positive and negative \nexperiences of youth peer education programmes (James, 2002; Renkin and Pedro, 2002), \nwith many arguing that lack of understanding of the reasons for programme successes \nand failures means that programmes often repeat the same mistakes. In a study \nthroughout South Africa, Hlongwa (2002) highlight unresolved issues which hinder \nprogramme planners and designers: the benefits of unpaid volunteers or paid peer \neducators; in-school versus out-of-school peer educators; and factors affecting \nprogramme sustainability.  \nManagement of schools programmes \nAdult control of programmes \nFrom Botswana, Leathlama, et al., (2002) argue that the reason for the ineffectiveness of \nmany youth-based programmes is that adults run them. Youth leadership is vital to facilitate \nyoung peoples\u2019 sense of working towards a common goal. Young people are often more \nlikely to understand and trust one another than adults, and are united by common cultural \ninterests (e.g. music) which can be harnessed for peer educational goals (with the proviso that \na degree of adult involvement is necessary for programme sustainability.) \n \n 10 \nTeacher training and confidence \nJohnson, Vergnani and Chopra (2002) point to the importance of regular in-service training \nfor South African teachers responsible for promoting HIV education, and the development of \nteachers\u2019 confidence to discuss sex with learners. A significant proportion of teachers who \nhad received intensive HIV-education training continued to harbour myths (e.g. that only \nsomeone with full-blown AIDS could spread HIV). Many trained teachers continued to lack \nconfidence about discussing AIDS and condoms with learners. Another South African study \nhighlights poor teacher awareness of the Department of Education\u2019s HIV-prevention policies \n(Ayo-Yusuf, Naidoo and Chikte, 2001). \n \nThe role of institutional leadership in overcoming stigma and denial \nChetty (2002) traces how institutional denial and the stigmatisation of HIV\/AIDS have \nhampered institutional responses in the educational field. He emphasises the role of strong \nleadership in changing the institutional climate in a way that promotes appropriate HIV-\nprevention. \n  \nThe quality of the within-school environment \nJohnson, Vergnani and Chopra (2002) point to the importance of active programme \nsupport and participation by school principals, the existence of a sound schools-based \nHIV\/AIDS policy, and the availability and proper translation of appropriate programme \nmaterials. Moletsane, et al. (2002) compare how school cultures impact on the likelihood \nof peer educational success in two South African township schools with different \norganisational styles. The first school has a more democratic, undisciplined and youth \nparticipatory ethos (the \u2018social capital model\u2019). The second is more concerned with rigid \nstructure and efficient management (the \u2018school effectiveness model\u2019). Whilst the social \ncapital school was better able to disseminate HIV-prevention lessons about gender \ninequalities in ways that students could understand, the better-managed school provided \nthe strongest long-term likelihood of institutionalising HIV-prevention programmes in \nsustainable ways.  \n \n 11 \nIntegration of peer education with other community strengthening efforts \nA South African study focuses on the importance of integrating HIV-prevention efforts with \nprogrammes seeking to empower young people through life skills and self-esteem promotion, \nvocational training, art and music therapy and individual and community development \nthrough sport (Renkin and Pedro, 2002). In a study of higher educational institutions\u2019 \nresponses to the epidemic, Chetty (2002) regrets that responses have too often been limited to \nthe level of awareness raising. He points to the need for institutions to develop more \nintegrated responses, combining awareness with community based care, workplace \nprogrammes and voluntary counselling and testing. \n \nA Zambian study draws attention to the complex array of multi-level factors impacting on \nhigh risk sexual behaviours by young people (Magnani, et al., 2002). Authors highlight the \ncomplex interaction of gender, peer influence and socio-demographic factors impacting on \nHIV transmission - making it unlikely that single interventions will change risk behaviour. In \nanother Zambian study, Motsepe, et al. (2002) point out that young people are increasingly \ncaring for people living with AIDS, and that their support and training should be part and \nparcel of integrated programmes in the HIV\/AIDS field. \n \nThe need to involve People Living with AIDS in prevention efforts \nWhilst stigmatisation and denial have historically made people reluctant to publicly disclose \ntheir HIV-positive status, and led others to treat them in an unsupportive and intolerant way, \nthis situation is starting to shift slightly as HIV-positive people organise in a more assertive \nway, and the sheer extent of the epidemic makes it increasingly difficult to deny. A South \nAfrican study argues for the vital importance of involving people with AIDS in the training \nof peer educators and in programme implementation (Nyawo and Xaba, 2002). Such \ninvolvement plays a key role in dispelling myths and stigma around HIV\/AIDS, and also in \nmotivating peer educators. Another South African study (Makhasi, 2002) reports on the need \nfor the training and support of HIV-positive youth ambassadors to encourage: \u2018positive \nliving\u2019 as a preventative tool, sexual behaviour change amongst peers, and lobbying around \nissues affecting youth living with AIDS. The success of such programmes is argued to \ndepend heavily on the extent to which they are supported by government, private sector and \ndonor agencies. \n 12 \n \nWider contextual factors impacting on peer educational success \nEnvironmental obstacles to HIV-prevention success \nSeveral papers highlight how external factors limit programmes. In rural Tanzanian schools \npeer education efforts were hindered by economic pressures on pupils to engage in risky sex, \nthe difficulties of organising regular peer education clubs and adult-free environments within \nschools, and low levels of literacy amongst youth peer educators. (Makokha, et al., 2002) A \nstudy in several African countries focused on the role played by NGOs in promoting youth \npeer education (Kelly, et al., 2002). The under-funding of NGO-linked peer education \nprogrammes was identified as a key barrier to success. Programmes lucky enough to receive \nsome funding still battled in the face of unstable budgets, which limited sustainability, as did \nover-reliance on non-paid volunteers. \n \nPartnerships and multi-sectoral responses \nWhilst youth peer education researchers often refer to the importance of partnerships and \nmulti-sectoral approaches, such references are made in passing with little discussion of the \ntypes of partnerships and multi-sectoral responses that are needed. However, some limited \ndiscussion of such factors does take place in papers about workplace peer education \nprogrammes aimed at adults. There is an urgent need for activists and researchers to start \ndocumenting information about the types of partnerships that are needed to supplement \nschools-based peer educational programmes.  The adult-targeted peer educational literature \nprovides a starting point for this challenge.  \n \nIn their study of HIV prevention in a South African gold mining community, Ndhlovu et al. \n(2002) highlight the need for programmes to develop models of multi-sectoral programme \nsupport to ensure effective implementation and programme sustainability. Efforts may be \nhampered by inadequate attention to capacity building around financial and project \nmanagement, or to the transfer of management power from programme researchers and \nfunders to local NGO\u2019s. Esu-Williams et al. (2002) focus on how stigma and discrimination \nhinders electricity workers from accessing workplace HIV\/AIDS services. Workers would be \nmore likely to access these services if they were offered by NGOs. Yet NGOs often lack \ncapacity in the areas of counselling, medical support and voluntary counselling and testing. \n 13 \nThey argue for partnerships between workplaces and NGOs \u2013 with workplaces helping \nNGOs to develop capacity, and NGOs assisting workplaces by providing neutral and trusted \nservices. Lovelace, et al. (2002) point to trade unions as the most appropriate partners with \nthe private sector for ensuring that workers access services.  \n \nNeed for development of youth advocacy \nArticles on peer education generally focus narrowly on the goals of HIV-prevention and \nAIDS care, with little focus on the potential of peer education to serve as springboard for \nwider efforts to encourage youth advocacy to lobby government, corporate structures and \ninternational actors about broader issues relating to youth empowerment (a key component of \npeer education success). One notable exception here is a paper by Moodley (2002) who calls \nfor the development of youth-specific advocacy frameworks for linking young people with \npowerful social actors and agencies beyond the boundaries of their local communities. \nDrawing on the experience of a number of African countries, he highlights the potential for \nmobilising famous African artists and musicians to play a role in the development and \nsupport of youth advocates. \n \nAnother exception was Schatz and Dzvimbo\u2019s (2001) Zimbabwean research, arguing not \nonly for greater adolescent involvement in programme design, but also for the importance of \nlocating HIV-prevention efforts within broader efforts to empower young people to make \nmore positive lifestyle decisions in other spheres of life. Such programmes are most likely to \nsucceed if they provide adolescents with channels to contribute to wider debates about public \npolicy reform and gender inequality, and to participate in multi-dimensional partnerships \naiming for wider social change. \n \nThis concludes our thumbnail overview of current academic debates about contextual \ninfluences on youth HIV-prevention programmes. Whilst various studies point to contextual \nfactors which impact on programme success, they do this in a fragmentary way. There is an \nurgent need to pull together this range of insights into more comprehensive conceptual \nframeworks. These would serve as conceptual tools for the design and evaluation of youth \npeer education. They would also provide guiding frameworks for much-needed research into \nthe types of community mobilisation \u2013 including partnerships and participation - most needed \n 14 \nto facilitate youth programmes, and into factors that facilitate or hinder the development of \nsuch partnerships and participation. \n \n3. Youth-oriented HIV prevention policies, campaigns and interventions \n \nMoving from research to policy and intervention, successful HIV prevention cannot be \nconducted in a vacuum. Efforts will be greatly enhanced if conducted within the contexts of \ngovernment policies that are supportive of peer educational goals. The role of youth \nparticipation and community mobilisation is widely recognised in the formulation of policies \nand the design of interventions. However, there is seldom adequate recognition of the \nchallenges facing community mobilisation efforts, or of the types of local community \nrelationships and alliances best suited to support youth HIV-prevention goals. Much work \nremains to be done in formulating concrete guidelines for translating policy and intervention \nrhetoric into practice. \nPolicies \nCurrent national efforts to promote HIV-prevention amongst young people fall, in part, \nwithin the context of the National Integrated Plan (NIP), an inter-sectoral national \ngovernment plan for responding to HIV\/AIDS. This plan pulls together the health, education \nand welfare sectors, although in practice the health department plays the largest role (Hickey, \n2001). Three programmes advocated by the plan include: schools life skills programmes and \nvoluntary counselling and testing programmes in public health facilities; and a community \nand home based care and support programme to be implemented at provincial level in \nselected sites. Life skills training is the entry point for efforts to prevent HIV-transmission \namongst learners.  \n \nThere are also individual efforts within the departments of education, health and social \ndevelopment. Within the Department of Education, for example, there is growing alarm \nabout the impact that the HIV\/AIDS epidemic will have on the educational sector. Uneca \n(2000) highlights 5 potential impacts:  declining student enrolments, increased teacher \nmortality and attrition, greater productivity losses, declining funds for education (through the \ndiversion of funds to Aids-related issues) and a reduction in the quality of education.  \n 15 \n \nTwo major policy initiatives have guided education department attempts to introduce \nHIV\/AIDS education as a priority area for young people. These include Curriculum 2005, \nseeking to shift schools from the traditional didactic methods towards more youth-centred, \nparticipatory approaches to learning, within frameworks encouraging broad life \ncompetencies, and the Life Skills and HIV\/AIDS Education Programme. The Department of \nEducation set up a central group of life skills trainers throughout the country to develop a \ncore curriculum for teacher training and classroom use. However, the impact of this initiative \nwas limited, partly because its success was undermined by an overly prescriptive approach to \ndealing with HIV, and because insufficient attention was paid to the programme by most \nschool principals (Dickson-Tetteh and Ladha, 2000). \n \nIn 2000, the new National Minister of Education, Kader Asmal, identified HIV\/AIDS as a \npriority issue, arguing that the education system is experiencing its worse crisis ever through \nHIV\/AIDS.  He plans to create the post of director of HIV\/AIDS within the education \ndepartment and has called for more peer education programmes in schools (Asmal, 2002). \nAcknowledging that \u2018quick fix\u2019 solutions are inadequate, emphasis is being laid on the need \nfor contextual interventions including initiatives to promote gender equity in schools, to \npromote conflict resolution, develop self-esteem, build a democratic school culture and \nsecure schools against violence. Whilst applauding these policy prescriptions in principle, \ndoubts have been expressed as to whether schools are equipped to deal with such complex \nsolutions, given their difficulties in implementing the relatively simpler life skills approaches \n(Morrell, et al., 2001). Poorly resourced schools may lack even pens and paper, let alone \nbooks and manuals to support teachers in curriculum implementation (Review Committee of \nCurriculum 2005, 2000). \n \nWithin the Department of Health, youth HIV prevention falls under the sub-directorate of \nYouth and Adolescent Health (within the Maternal, Child and Women\u2019s Health \ndirectorate). This group has, for example, set up a task team to formulate Policy \nGuidelines for Young Peoples\u2019 Health, emphasising the influence of the social \nenvironment on their behaviour, particularly the potentially negative impact of gender \nrelations. Against this background, the Dept. Health has emphasised the importance of \n 16 \nproviding a safe and supportive environment for young people, providing them with \ninformation about health risks, building health-related skills, offering counselling, and \nensuring access to health services (Dickson-Tetteh and Ladha, 2000). One example of an \ninitiative by the Department of Social Development is the \u2018National Strategic Framework for \nChildren infected and affected by HIV\/AIDS\u2019, which focuses on the effects of AIDS on \nchildren.  \nMedia campaigns \nVarious government departments have been involved in facilitating various HIV-related \nmedia campaigns aimed at young people, including the Beyond Awareness Campaign, Soul \nCity and LoveLife. Much money and energy have gone into developing and implementing \nthese. Whilst campaign evaluations claim success in promoting behaviour change, \ncontroversy exists surrounding the validity and reliability of the methods used by evaluation \nresearchers and of the effectiveness of the media as a behaviour change agent (Leclerc-\nMadlala, 2002). Whilst media campaigns undoubtedly have a role to play in increasing \nfactual knowledge of health risks, the gap between knowledge and behaviour change is often \nwide. This is why so much emphasis is being placed on promoting youth participation in \nHIV-prevention campaigns, in the light of the insight that behaviour change is most likely to \ntake place in collective peer contexts, and on the basis of active youth participation in health \npromotional efforts. To cite only one example, consistent with this growing emphasis on \nparticipation, in partnership with local and overseas funding agencies, the Department of \nSocial Development is currently one of the major funders of a new component of the \nLoveLife programme, aimed at building a national youth service core of youth health \neducation volunteers.  \n \nInterventions \nThere is a proliferation of large and small-scale HIV-prevention interventions aimed at young \npeople in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), our particular province of interest. These use various entry \npoints, including life skills training in schools, drama, sports, gender and women\u2019s projects, \nchurch activities, leadership and advocacy drives, and reproductive health promotion efforts. \nThese draw on various civil society, government and private sector players in partnerships \nand stand-alone programmes. Here we cite some examples of this work. \n 17 \n \nDramAide is an NGO which seeks to personalise the risk of HIV\/AIDS through promoting \nyouth participation in dance, poetry and drama. DramAide projects include \u2018Act-alive\u2019, \nwhich develops secondary school youth clubs and seeks to establish \u2018health promoting \nschools\u2019 as \u2018drivers\u2019 for developing local communities that are caring and supportive of \npeople living with AIDS. \u2018Circle-time\u2019 focuses on life skills development amongst primary \nschool children. \u2018Pro-teach\u2019 works with tertiary, secondary and primary school teachers, \ncovering in-service life skill courses for teachers and pre-service courses education colleges. \n  \nAn increasingly popular strategy is developing youth role models and leadership. Effective \nAIDS care is increasingly being emphasised as an important tool of HIV prevention. Seeing \npeople with AIDS involved in life-enhancing and fulfilling activities, and being treated \nhumanely, helps young people to confront their own denial and fears of infection, and seek \nout prevention information. One such project is run by the National Youth Commission, and \nis known as the Young Positive Living Ambassadors project, first piloted in KZN.  Its main \nobjective is to promote acceptance and care of young people living with HIV and AIDS, and \nto prevent further spread of HIV, through the notion of \u2018positive living\u2019.  The project has a \nrights-based approach and is underpinned by the belief that young people must own and drive \nprogrammes that are designed to meet their needs. \n \nThe YMCA has developed a well-respected peer education programme known as \u2018Better Life \nOptions\u2019 (BLO), with good links to the Department of Health, locally, provincially and \nnationally.  BLO seeks to change the behaviour of young people (in and out of school), \nbuilding a healthy youth culture and providing family life education.  It is underpinned by a \npeer education approach in schools, youth clubs and churches.  The programme is youth-\ndriven, including young local and regional co-ordinators. Despite significant successes, \ninterviews with BLO staff also highlight the challenges that face them in their work. One of \nthese is working with local churches, for example.  Many young people have felt that \nprogramme goals are inconsistent with conservative patriarchal church structures, which \ndeliver prescriptive messages that may be at variance with young peoples\u2019 everyday life \ncontexts and relationships. Parental involvement has also been complicated.  Many parents \nfeel they are not good role models for the types of behaviours needed for enhanced sexual \nhealth, and are sometimes happy to leave this aspect of their children\u2019s education to others. \n 18 \n \n \n4. What types of relationships should community mobilisation strategies be seeking  \nto promote? \n \nThe policies and interventions outlined above are consistent with Beeker et al.\u2019s (1998) claim \nthat the field of HIV-prevention has undergone a \u2018paradigm drift\u2019 away from its initial focus \non individual behavioural factors, to include attention to the importance of strengthening \ncommunities to respond appropriately to the epidemic. In relation to youth, this \u2018drift\u2019 has \nbeen motivated by three insights. The first is the importance of promoting grassroots youth \nparticipation in HIV-prevention efforts. The second is the importance of linking HIV \nprevention efforts with other life skills or youth interest programmes. The third is the key role \nof \u2018partnership working\u2019 in programme funding, design and implementation. The problem of \nHIV\/AIDS is too complex to be addressed by any single constituency, and particularly by \nconstituencies such as youth, who traditionally have minimal access to political influence and \neconomic power. The most effective response is one that is spearheaded by partnerships both \nwithin grassroots communities, and among grassroots collectivities and appropriate \ngovernment agencies, civil society groupings \u2013 and where possible, appropriate private sector \nand donor agencies at the local, national and international levels. \n \nHowever, the academic world of HIV-prevention has lagged behind the world of policy and \npractice in recognising and theorising the vital role of the community strengthening strategies \nof participation and partnerships. Whilst the research reviewed above repeatedly points to the \nway in which various aspects of school, community and social contexts have the power to \nundermine HIV-prevention efforts, and pays lip service to the importance of participation and \npartnerships, these studies tend to be fragmentary and descriptive, and conducted out of the \ncontext of comprehensive conceptual frameworks which provide a systematic account of the \ntypes of social relationships most likely to facilitate the success of prevention efforts.  \nFurthermore, a large international development studies research literature points to the \nimmense difficulties of promoting and sustaining community strengthening participation and \npartnerships. Much work remains to be done in exploring the gap between the rhetoric and \n 19 \nreality of community mobilisation, and in promoting understandings of those factors that \npromote or hinder its success. \n \nA recent study of a multi-sectoral partnership created to manage a large and well-resourced \nHIV-prevention programme in a South African mining community highlighted a myriad of \nfactors which undermined (i) the development of partnerships within marginalized \ncommunities, as well as (ii) collaboration among grassroots communities and partners drawn \nfrom provincial and national government, trade unions, mining houses, researchers and \ninternational development agencies (Campbell, forthcoming). Marginalized communities \nwere often divided in ways that undermined the likelihood of effective and united \nparticipation in projects to achieve goals of mutual benefit (such as reduced HIV-\ntransmission). The effectiveness of multi-stakeholder partnerships was undermined by lack of \ncommon understandings of the problem of HIV\/AIDS and how to solve it; lack of health \nsystems expertise to synthesise the talents and contributions of such a diverse range of \nconstituencies; the dominance of a biomedical model of disease control over more social \nperspectives which meant that powerful biomedical actors often didn\u2019t have adequate \nunderstanding of the rationale for partnerships; varying levels of commitment and motivation \nby different groups of players; and inadequate incentives\/ systems of accountability to \nmotivate more powerful groupings to participate in assisting less powerful ones. \n \nIf participation and partnerships are indeed to play such a key role as strategies for supporting \nHIV-prevention efforts, there is an urgent need for systematic research into the types of \nrelationships and alliances best suited to performing this role, as well as the identification of \nfactors most likely to promote or hinder their success. The concept of \u2018social capital\u2019 is \nincreasingly being cited in debates about what constitutes a health-enabling community \ncontext, most likely to provide an environment that supports peer education efforts, and \nprovides a useful starting point for this task (Blaxter, 2000). According to the social capital \nperspective, people are most likely to adopt health-enhancing behaviours (such as safer sex) \nin communities characterised by high levels of trust, reciprocal help and support, positive \nlocal identities and participation in informal and formal social networks and organisations \n(Baum, 1998). Kreuter (1997, p. 3) define social capital as \u2018those specific processes among \npeople and organisations, working collaboratively and in an atmosphere of trust, that lead to \nthe accomplishment of goals of mutual social benefit\u2019. Social capital researchers are \n 20 \nconcerned to examine the role of informal and formal social networks; and norms of co-\noperation in promoting local community development. They examine the way in which these \nnorms and networks operate both within a local community, and in its relationship to outside \nnetworks and institutions.  \n \nApplying the social capital framework to the HIV\/AIDS field, our starting assumption would \nbe the belief that even within constraints of poverty, stigma and gender inequalities, young \npeople in the marginalised communities that are most susceptible to HIV infection are able to \nparticipate in effective collective action improve their circumstances. However the extent to \nwhich this participation is effective depends heavily on the quality of the partnerships or \nalliances that youth are able to form with groupings that have greater access to material \nresources and political influence. The unequal distribution of social capital is one of the key \nmechanisms whereby poverty and ill-health are perpetuated, and whereby poor people are \nhindered from improving their life circumstances (Bourdieu, 1986). Building social capital \nthus becomes a key challenge for those seeking to work with poor people to improve the life \ncircumstances that place them at particular risk of HIV\/AIDS. \n \nSaegert, Thompson and Warren (2001) distinguish between three forms of social capital - \nwhich are relevant to the types of relationships most likely to facilitate effective youth-led \nHIV prevention. This framework provides a starting point for systematising the types of \nrelationships community mobilisation strategies, such as participation and partnerships,  \nshould be seeking to build. The first of these is bonding social capital, which refers to \nrelationships of trust, reciprocity and positive common identity within homogenous groups. \nThis is the kind of social capital that would result from the development of close-knit groups \nof young people involved in particular HIV-prevention programmes within particular local \ncommunities. Such networks would provide young people with contexts for engaging in \ncollective debate and argument about the possibility of behaviour change, as well as \nfacilitating the processes of empowerment and critical consciousness outlined above. \nHowever, given that many young peoples\u2019 inability to change their behaviour may also relate \nto their lack of access to various political and material resources, a wider series of linkages \nand relationships is needed to support them in achieving their goals. These are the linkages \ninherent in bridging and linking social capital. \n \n 21 \nBridging social capital refers to four different sorts of relationships. The first is bridging \nrelationships across different groups within particular geographical communities. An \nexample of this might include relationships between a youth peer education group on the one \nhand, and e.g. local women\u2019s, church or sports groups with an interest in HIV-prevention on \nthe other hand. The second refers to relationships between groups in different low income \ncommunities. These might include the development of networks of solidarity between groups \nof youth peer educators from different geographical communities. The third refers to links \nbetween poor and more affluent communities. These might include links between local youth \npeer education networks and youth or women\u2019s or church groups from more affluent areas. \nThe fourth refers to networks that link the three kinds of networks referred to above at a \nnational level. \n \nLinking social capital refers to linkages between local community residents and \nrepresentatives of mainstream economic and political institutions. Researchers have coined \nthe term \u2018synergy\u2019 to characterise a situation where grassroots community groupings, \neconomic actors and state institutions work together for positive developmental outcomes \n(Woolcock, 1998). In relation to economic actors, alliances between community groupings, \nand local businesses or employers may play a role in the development of income generation \nschemes for youth out of school, for example. The latter may also contribute funding or \naccess to space for youth meetings or drop-in centres, to cite another example. Evans (1996) \nargues that community development projects are said to have the greatest chance of success \nin conditions of \u2018state-society synergy\u2019, other words where government policies and practices \nare supportive of the goals of the local project. Ideally, linking social capital joining up \nmarginalised communities and local or national government networks has the capacity to \nensure that government actors are aware of the specific needs and interests of young people, \nwho may not traditionally have had access to formal channels for feeding this information to \nthem. \n \nWhat are the areas in which young people need support and assistance in furthering the HIV-\nprevention struggle? What are the challenges facing participants in the different types of \nalliances or partnerships we have discussed above? In the short-term, youth clearly need \nassistance with the immediate challenges of implementing participatory sexual health \npromotion programmes and distributing condoms. However, at the pragmatic level, their \n 22 \nability to provide effective peer education is influenced by the community and social contexts \nwithin which they are located. Thus, we would argue the second challenge facing such \nalliances is that of assisting young people in small local communities in lobbying for the \nrecognition of their wider needs and interests beyond the health sphere \u2013 both locally, \nnationally and internationally. Following from this, the third challenge is that of developing \nlocal community health networks which not only support young people in their efforts to \npromote sexual health, but also have the potential to strengthen communities to cope with the \nchallenge of providing appropriate support and tolerance for youth already living with \nHIV\/AIDS, as well as the challenge of reconstructing the social fabric of HIV-afflicted \ncommunities once the epidemic has run its course. Much work remains to be done in (i) \nexamining which forms of social capital have the potential to assist local communities in \nmeeting each of these challenges, (ii) conducting systematic research into the evolution, \nnature and effectiveness of different participation and partnership strategies; and (iii) \ndeveloping understandings of the factors which promote or hinder the success of the different \ntypes of alliance\/ linkages underlying each type of social capital. \n 23 \n References \n \nAggleton, P and Campbell, C (2000) Working with young people: towards an agenda for \nsexual health.
