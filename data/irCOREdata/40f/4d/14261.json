Networked learning is a\nterm that has had a currency for some years now and can be seen as part of the development\nof a new paradigm in education (Harasim, Hiltz, Teles and Turoff, 1995; Koschmann 1996;\nRomiszowski and Ravitz, 1997). We have defined networked learning as learning in which\nC&.IT is used to promote connections: between one learner and other learners; between\nlearners and tutors; between a learning community and its learning resources.\nAs part of the background for the main investigations into students' experiences, we are\nalso conducting a 'mapping' exercise, which locates and describes examples of the use of\n18\nAIT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nnetworked learning in UK higher education. The mapping exercise also involves interviews\nwith a wide variety of HE teaching staff to get a sense of their perspectives on current and\nfuture uses of networked learning. This paper focuses on a small subset of these interviews.\nThe space of possibilities for networked learning is vast, for this reason the project has\nidentified some priority areas on which attention should be focused:\n\u2022 the use of asynchronous communications technologies to support collaborative\nlearning among geographically and \/or temporally distributed groups of students;\n\u2022 the use of synchronous video communications to allow remote access to live lectures\nand demonstrations;\n\u2022 approaches which mix the use of Web resources with asynchronous or synchronous\ninterpersonal communication.\nIn this paper we report on accounts by practitioners who all made use of text-based\ncommunication systems provided over the Internet. All courses were available using Web\naccess, either primarily or as a supplement to a client-server system, and some had Web\nresources that were distinct from the conferencing system itself. The interviewees had at\nleast two academic years' experience of the use of networked learning. They ranged from\nexperts who had used a variety of systems for a long period of time to early adopters who\nhave deployed courses over recent years.\nMethodology\nThe project is informed by a phenomenographic approach and this provides a link between\nthe various aspects of the overall project. Ference Marton explained phenomenography as\na research approach for understanding people's ways of experiencing the world. He defined\nthe approach as:\nthe empirical study of the differing ways in which people experience, perceive,\napprehend, understand, or conceptualize various phenomena in, and aspects of, the\nworld around them. (Marton, 1994, p. 4424)\nThe aim of phenomenography is to describe qualitatively different ways of experiencing\nphenomena, in this case practitioners' experiences of networked learning. The objective is\nto illuminate the variations in ways of experiencing networked learning (Marton and\nBooth, 1997; Laurillard, 1993). Whilst this approach is not widely used outside educational\nresearch it has a long history in an educational context. Phenomenographic research has\nan important place informing theories of teaching and learning and focuses particularly on\nstudent activity (Biggs, 1999). Recently phenomenographic research has been extended to\ninvestigate the role of teachers in relation to student activity (Prosser and Trigwell, 1999).\nThe phenomenographic approach is particularly suited to our aims as the project is\ninvestigating both student activity and practitioners' accounts of their activity.\nWe report interviews with practitioners carried out as part of a mapping exercise, which\nattempts to situate our research investigating student experiences within a 'snapshot' of the\nspread and use of networked learning in higher education in the UK. The interviewees\nwere not intended to be a sample of networked learning users and were recruited\nopportunistically within the categories outlined in the introduction. The aim of the\n19\nChris Jones et ol Networked learning in higher education: practitioners' perspectives\nresearch is to illuminate rather than to provide a systematic sample of current\npractitioners' views.\nThis initial report relies on interviews with ten practitioners from eight departments in five\nuniversities that were conducted during a six-month period. The interviews were\napproximately one hour in duration and focused on the practitioners' use of networked\nlearning technology to deliver a particular course. The interviews were largely unstructured\nthough the interviewers had a loose schedule or format that provided some consistency\nbetween interviews and indicated key areas of interest. The interviews were conducted as a\ndialogue and each interview began with a request for the practitioner to explain a course\nthat they had taught using networked learning. Practitioners were encouraged to use\nprompts such as course documentation and online access to course materials during the\ninterview. The interviewer tried to intervene as little as possible and concentrated on asking\nquestions that provoked reflection by the respondent on their own experience.\nThe emphasis in the interviews we conducted was in stimulating the practitioner's reflec-\ntion upon their experience. This conforms to Marton's view that the phenomenographic\ninterview provokes a change from unreflected to reflected awareness (Marton, 1994). In the\ninterview, the aim was to 'make things which are unthematized and implicit into objects of\nreflection, and hence thematized and explicit' (Marton, 1994, p. 4427).\nThe analysis of the interview data has concentrated on the written transcripts of the\ninterviews taken verbatim from audio recording. The interviews have been examined for\nvariations in the experiences of the practitioners and to try and identify emergent elements\nthat might be common between them. The analysis focused on both variation and the\npossibility of a limited number of types of variation being present. The transcripts have\nbeen analysed from the point of view of the phenomena (networked learning) rather than\nthe individual interview. The separations between individual accounts have been\ntemporarily abandoned. The individual accounts are likely to vary internally and each\ninterview might provide variations within itself as well as between different interviews. It is\nexpected that later analysis will look at the individual interview as a unit of analysis. The\nanalytic process in phenomenographic research is iterative, once categories of description\nare found they can be reapplied to the data from which they originate. The results reported\nin this paper are an initial set of categories that have been generated and they are currently\nbeing reapplied to the data and reported back to participants.\nPhenomenographic research has been criticized from an ethnomethodological perspective\nfor its reliance upon the interview (Fleming, 1986). Fleming gives an example of 'versions'\n- that is, of an individual giving a series of accounts of one event to a variety of audiences.\nEach account is different; each is fitted to its particular purpose and might appear to be\nout of place in another setting. The point being that all accounts are partial, that they\npoint towards something but cannot contain all the information required for a complete\ndescription of that which is being described. So in the example chosen by Fleming an\naccount given by a student to his mother of the day's events would not be replaceable by\nthe account given to his tutor of the same day's events. The accounts may both be truthful\nand accurate in the context of their use. This raises the question of the status of the\ninterview and the reliance we have placed upon it in this research and in phenomenography\nmore generally.\n20\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nA recent critical review of phenomenography gives both a useful review of phenomeno-\ngraphic research and offers a 'constructionist' revision of traditional phenomenographic\napproaches (Richardson, 1999). Richardson argues that conceptions of reality are discursive\npractices, which may be used as resources in particular communicative encounters, rather\nthan psychological entities that reside in the minds of individuals (p. 72). Richardson argues\nfor more attention to be paid to accounts given by participants in real-life situations. We\nwould agree with this point but would argue further that viewing interviews as situational\nand paying attention to the context of the interview itself will help to deal with Fleming's\ncriticism of interview-based data. Unlike much phenomenographic research we adopt a\nsceptical stance towards statements made by interviewees, accepting that the accounts given\nare indeed versions fit for the purpose of the interview. We will point to some ways in which\nwe believe the contextual nature of the interview has affected the research we have\nconducted. We none the less believe that the accounts given by practitioners examined in the\nways we have outlined can provide us with some valuable insights. In particular we believe\ninterviews can be treated as reports of the resources that practitioners have available for\naction. In order to demonstrate this we set out below some preliminary findings.\nFindings\nThe practitioners interviewed were from a number of HE backgrounds, six taught using\nnetworked learning at postgraduate level and four at undergraduate level. Most had\nconsiderable experience in this field, up to ten years, and the less experienced had used\nnetworked learning for at least two academic years. Practitioners taught in eight\ndepartments including law, information technology, library and information studies,\neducation and management.\nTight and loose structures\nRespondents identified a problem of course design and administration that we have\ntentatively designated 'tight-loose'. They were concerned with how to organize students\nand how much to organize students. Within the respondents' accounts the issue was often\nseen as involving either tight or loose structures. Practitioners had often experienced\ncourses that had not run as they expected and in later iterations, or in plans for future\niterations, referred to changes in the structures of enforcement. Assessment criteria and\ncourse requirements, such as attendance at face-to-face sessions or active participation\nonline, were the common examples of the concerns about structure and enforcement.\nThe problem was identified in a number of ways with an underlying issue concerning\nmutual expectations. Two illustrative quotes concerning 'tight' structures are given below:\nPart of the point of having a very tight structure was to encourage people to participate\nin, in a much more, well in a way in which the mutual expectations are more clearly\nunderstood. [John]\nThe reason for setting the deadlines and structuring a timetable has been in response to\none of the problems which arose the previous year which was that one team would post\na load of messages to the other teams and then have to sit and wait for three days\nbefore the others bothered to reply because that team happened to be better organized,\nso the structuring of the exercises in terms of the time schedule has been and I think\nnecessitated in order to actually save them from wasting their time. [Norman]\n21\nChris Jones et al Networked learning in higher education: practitioners' perspectives\nThe practitioners expressed concerns with how to organize students so that they could\nanticipate each others' actions and co-ordinate their work. This concerned the use of\ndeadlines, whether to provide detailed instructions on the work to be done and whether to\nenforce or encourage rates and types of participation. For example:\nWe've tried to structure it fairly tightly and we may tighten that up even more this year\n. . . the downside of that I think is that with the tighter the schedule the more structured\nthe exercise is and there is a danger that you're damping down on the potential for\ncreativity and the extra time of the research that might be produced in that extra time,\nif you see what I mean, but there's a fine balance to be drawn there,... [Norman]\nThe choice of a loose rather than a tight structure was also associated with attempts to\nrefine assessment structures. Practitioners who had experience of assessment being used to\nengineer participation or interaction were concerned about its consequences either in terms\nof workload or in terms of unintended consequences:\nOne of the dominant issues was that we began to believe that our programme was\nheavily over-assessing students, that created more work for them and more work for us.\n[John]\nWhat they begin to see is or what they seem to see is the fact that the tutor wants to see\nthem interacting online and our experience has been that they will work together offline\nand then come into the lab and they'll put the stuff up onto the conferencing system\nwhich is supposed to show that they are learning online. But they're not, they're doing\nthat for your benefit or because that's what their perception is. [Jack]\nLooser structures were in part responses to the perverse effects that structured\ninterventions had, which undermined the course designers' intentions. Overall the concern\nwith structure could be seen as a response to gaps between design intentions and actual\noutcomes.\nDisappointment\nRelated to the practical issue of how formally structured a networked learning\nenvironment might need to be was a common articulation of disappointment at the actual\nexperience of the course when compared with expectations. We look at expectations more\nclosely in the following section and in this section examine what factors influenced\nrespondents in expressing disappointment.\nDisappointment was a common but not a universal feature. Low participation was the\nreported factor related to disappointment, and practitioners who did not experience low\nparticipation did not express disappointment with course outcomes. The structural\nvariations proposed by practitioners were driven by views on students' motivations to\nparticipate. Overall practitioners had a problem relating their design expectations to the\noutcomes that they experienced, a particularly clear example is provided below:\nWhat else um I certainly haven't yet learnt how to do it so I so I still don't know how to\ncreate an online learning environment that would work in the way I imagined it might.\nThere are probably trivial examples where I can get things to pan out the way I want\nbut I think you find this quite common that people however much experience they have\ndeveloped, however many articles they write about good ways of doing things, however\n22\nALT-} Volume 8 Number 2\nmuch they analyse student experiences, it's still extremely difficult to design an online\nenvironment and online course activities in ways where you are not surprised and\/or\ndisappointed by the output. [John]\nTwo of our respondents stood out as not experiencing the same disappointment as others.\nTheir use of networked learning was at postgraduate level and was informed by a very\nconsistent educational theory that had initial 'tight' structures, for example compulsory\nparticipation and residential sessions, but then allowed a greater degree of freedom in\ncourse dynamics once the base expectations were set. The educational philosophy they had\nwas similar and both programmes embodied a strong group ethos. Participation in these\ncourses was obligatory. In response to the question 'How is participation - is it high or is it\nlow?' Tim answered:\nWell it varies I think um from person to person but no one can get through the course\nwithout participating and they know that so that's one factor. I think in some courses\nthat use computer conferencing, at the OU for instance, you can take the course and do\nnothing in the computer conference and still get through the course. In ours you\ncouldn't. That's a difference but it's incredibly high I mean sometimes it's just too much.\nrrim]\nThis contrasted sharply with the majority of respondents who expressed disappointment\nrelated to low rates of participation.\nIn this module there is a very clear design assumption that everyone would participate\nin the online environment and that they will do that in quite a highly structured way...\nit's not uncommon in previous modules for the online activity to be seen by the\nstudents as entirely optional. The majority of them wouldn't participate at all in any\none module and if you look back over the last two years on the programme under half\nof the students that could participate in the online activity did so. So this is actually\nbetter than that, but it's not as good as I hoped for when I was designing it. [John]\nThe concern with low rates of participation and the discussion of 'tighter' structures fed\nthe sense of disappointment. An illustration of this link can be found in the following\ncomment:\nthe fundamental questions of student participation and participation by all the\nstudents in it um remain unresolved as they ever were in some ways . . . It's making me\nquestion um whether the structure is the way to encourage participation, so by having\nset tasks and activities and demanding that the students or even making this stronger\nand saying you must contribute is that the way to go forward. [Alice]\nStronger enforcements were part of a wider rethinking of principles and related to\nperceptions of students' motivations as instrumental:\nI certainly think I've had to rethink things that I believed in. From a liberal education\npoint of view that people were here because they wanted to learn and now I don't\nknow, I'm not sure that they will do this module because they want to learn about it.\nThey'll do this module because they want a specific grade to get the specific final\ndegree. [Robert]\n23\nChris Jones et al Networked learning in higher education: practitioners' perspectives\nThe expression of surprise and disappointment were reported as a response to levels of\nparticipation and more generally to the ability to design to anticipate outcomes in a\nnetworked learning environment.\nExpectations\nPerhaps the underlying issue behind disappointment was connected to the type and level of\nexpectations of our practitioners. As interviewers we had our own expectations and one\nwas that the practitioners might vary between those who were pioneers and had become\nexpert in the use of networked learning and those who were more recent adopters. It\nbecame apparent on reading the transcripts that there was a common 'philosophy' or\neducational approach that underpinned their work. This could be reduced to a series of\nbullet points including:\nPeople learn\n\u2022 collaboratively by articulating and sharing their ideas, experience and expertise through\ndiscussion and dialogue;\n\u2022 by linking ideas from literature, online contributions and their own practice and\nexperience;\n\u2022 by doing, by engaging with the activity or task;\n\u2022 from experience, either positive or negative and from exposure to different tutoring and\nlearning styles.\nIt can be seen from this list of points that the practitioners have a relatively common\neducational outlook that may be particular to them or reflective of this particular time and\nplace. The outlook expressed is similar to that described as the emergent computer-\nsupported collaborative learning paradigm by Koschmann (1996).\nThe types of assumptions about learning that we found are illustrated below:\nOne of the things that we want is for people to learn from each other, get insights into\ntheir own work by hearing about other peoples' work . . . um . . . actually giving some\nof their background is really quite useful. [John]\nWe encourage students to use it [online environment] to share their experiences and\ntheir expertise. [Alice]\nJThe programme] is very much focused around the personal development or\nprofessional development and works a lot in the area of relationships and discussion\nand dialogue. [Penny]\nWe decided we were going to develop a course like this and what we wanted to do was, we\nwanted to sort of turn in on itself so they could learn about developing teaching and\nlearning systems by experiencing a number of teaching and learning systems. [Robert]\nAll the practitioners except one either mentioned constructivist or collaborative\napproaches to learning, many expressed their ideas in terms of communities of practice.\nThe one respondent who made no mention of such approaches was using a combination of\nWeb pages and individual email to promote a dialogue in the form of philosophical letters\nwith the students. A wide variety of pedagogical techniques have been associated with\n24\nALT-} Volume 8 Number 2\nnetworked learning and it is surprising to find s^uch a narrow range of underlying\napproaches adopted by the practitioners (Paulsen, 1995).\nIn relation to expectations we have found that practitioners often referred to students as\nbeing 'good students', 'compliant students', and 'motivated students'. We found that these\ndescriptions of students were related to the student matching or not matching with the\neducational philosophy or approach of the course\/programme. Thus, for instance, when\ndiscussing assessment a practitioner said the following:\nThis is another issue I find very difficult about assignment marking. Students who feed\nback the party line about collaborative learning and whatever and I don't mean just\nfeed it back in a sense of hype and stuff but people who have clearly seen the benefits of\ncollaborative learning. It's hard not to give them high marks because this is what we are\ntrying to teach people, the value of collaborative learning. However people who don't\nsee it and don't want to and stand out against collaborative learning . . . I've only seen\nones that I could, you know bending over backwards, give 60 to because I'm trying to\nnot be biased against them. [Elaine]\nSeveral practitioners described collaborative learning as a 'problem'. Student resistance\nconcerned some whilst others were concerned by a lack of clarity among other\npractitioners about what 'collaboration' might mean. Overall practitioners identified\ncollaboration as an aim but were concerned that it was difficult to achieve and difficult to\nconceptualize. Collaboration and participation were both features that exemplify the gap\nthat practitioners experienced between expectations and outcomes.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nWe suggest that the issue of tight vs. loose structures that permeated the interviews may be\na significant issue for practitioners. Whilst the practitioners expressed a similar common\nphilosophy or paradigm they did not have a stable repertoire of 'rules of thumb', of\nreliable design guidelines. In a traditional or face-to-face setting expectations are in some\nways common sense or common knowledge (Edwards and Mercer, 1987). Participation in\nlectures and seminars, whilst not unproblematic, has a set of commonly understood\nassumptions about attendance and behaviour. This should not be taken to imply that we\nfully understand face-to-face settings or that we endorse common-sense views of such\nsettings, only that such shared expectations are present in face-to-face contexts. The\nboundaries within a networked setting appeared less commonly understood and each\npractitioner had comments to make about how they had varied their own practices\nbetween tight and loose structures to try and remedy outcomes they had not expected.\nPractitioners articulated their experience in terms of either loose or tight structures. We\nwould suggest that a reconception might be possible in terms not of an either\/or\ndichotomy but in terms of a number of trade-offs. The use of loose elements in one area\nmight require the use of tight structure elsewhere. Practitioners might be able to make\ninformed choices not between enforcement and free expression but how and where to\nenforce in order to allow free expression elsewhere (cf. van Driel, Verlop, van Werven and\nDeckers, 1997; Goodyear and Steeples, 1992). Some support for this view was found in the\ntwo practitioners who did not express disappointment at low rates of participation. Their\n25\nChris Jones et al Networked learning in higher education: practitioners' perspectives\ncourses exhibited tight initial structures and compulsory participation but then allowed\nrelative freedom in a loosely structured environment. In our further analysis we will look\nfor the precise ways in which structures and enforcement are discussed. For example, most\npractitioners reported that residential sessions were essential for building a learning\ncommunity. In order for people to be able to contribute online and be comfortable with the\nmedium it was felt they needed to have met their colleagues face-to-face in the first\ninstance. The ability to maintain face-to-face sessions was a reported problem for courses\nthat were becoming more international and Web-based.\nWe wonder why both expert practitioners and early adopters display a common\neducational philosophy. That philosophy may not be well understood or accepted outside\nthis narrow and possibly self-selected group. The disappointment we found expressed may\nhave implications for a large-scale roll out of new technologies. Disappointment if widely\nexperienced by new practitioners in the field of networked learning, could lead to\nresistance to the adoption of networked learning in the future. Already there is evidence\nthat students experience distress and frustration in networked environments and that\nthese experiences may inhibit their educational opportunities (Hara and Kling, 1999).\nThe practitioners' common educational philosophy and the theories that provide the\nrationale for the paradigm of networked learning may not be well understood in the\nintended audience for educational technologies. This would raise questions of staff\ndevelopment and suggest that it required significantly more than simple training in the\ntechnology.\nOur findings help us to comment on the general approach of phenomenography. The\naccounts we were given were specific to the situation. We were offered a particular example\nof this by one respondent who pointed to another interview she had given within days of\nthe interview with us and commented on how she had reported her experiences differently\nin the second interview. Other respondents have written accounts of their courses, for\nexample as case studies, which vary from the accounts we were given. We believe that this\ndoes not invalidate the data gathered by interview. However, it must make us cautious in\nwhat we claim interview data represents. We do not believe, for example, that the interview\nreveals any fixed internal state. This finding tends to support the characterization of\ninterview accounts as versions provided by Fleming (1986). More positively we claim that\nthe interview reveals some of the resources for action available to the respondent. These\nresources may or may not be used to inform practice and may provide an after-the-event\nrationalized account rather than motives prior to action. The interviewees display the\ncharacteristics of reflective practitioners and we cannot be sure that the movement from\nunreflected to reflected awareness was achieved in the interviews. This is an important\nfinding as Marton has relied on this transition from unreflected to reflected or meta-\nawareness in his defence of the interview from its critics (Marton, 1994; Marton and\nBooth, 1997, pp. 129-32). Most of the interviewees have written about their experiences\nand had previously reflected upon the issues that the interview raised. The accounts we\nheard were in some senses a performance of previously rehearsed ideas.\nFinally we would like to comment on the idea of good or 'best' practice. Practitioners\ngenerally expressed a concern that they did not fully understand the relationship between\ntheir educational designs and their outcomes. It might be that there is not yet sufficient\ncommon agreement or a common-sense view of educational practice in a networked\n26\nALT-J Volume 8 Number 2\nenvironment. This may mean that rather than a best practice or even a singular good\npractice we may find various good practices, each fit for particular purposes. In which case\nthe best we may be able to distil from practitioners' reports of their practice will be rules of\nthumb. Design of learning environments may well be revealed as an iterative process in\nwhich there is continuous identification of problems and modifications of practice.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was partially funded by a grant from the Committee on Awareness, Liaison and\nTraining of JISC (the Joint Information Systems Committee of the UK higher education\nfunding councils).
