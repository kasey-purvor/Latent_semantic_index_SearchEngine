[1\u20133]. These early calculations\ndelivered a great number of useful insights into the basic\nmechanisms of heavy-ion collisions, even with the large prac-\ntical restrictions of that time concerning the model, degrees of\nfreedom, and symmetries. However, it was soon recognized not\nto be as comprehensive a description as originally expected.\nFor example, widths in the distributions of fragments and\nkinetic energies are systematically underestimated, a fact\nwhich had been traced back in parts to missing correlations\n[4,5]. More puzzling was that average quantities, such as fusion\ncross sections, did not come out all that well although they\nshould be predictable by mean field dynamics. Already at that\ntime there were indications that the many restrictions in the\ncalculations spoil their predictive value and that, for example,\nsimply the proper handling of the spin-orbit (l\u2217s) force can\nimprove the results considerably towards the experimentally\nobserved dissipation [6,7]. Computer limitations halted these\ndevelopments for a while. The subsequent dramatic advance\nin computational power now allows three-dimensional TDHF\ncalculations with a full-fledged Skyrme force, without any\nsymmetry restrictions, and for any nuclear size. Accordingly,\nthere is a renewed interest in TDHF studies as seen from recent\npublications on resonance dynamics [8\u201310] and heavy-ion\ncollisions [11]. The present manuscript also deals with recent\n3D TDHF calculations and aims to investigate the importance\nof a full treatment of the l\u2217s force and related dissipation\nmechanisms.\nTDHF in a nuclear context means a time-dependent mean-\nfield theory derived from an effective energy functional. The\nmost widely used is the Skyrme functional which was proposed\nlong ago as a quantitative self-consistent model for the nuclear\nground state [12] and dynamics [13]. The Skyrme energy-\ndensity functional consists of free kinetic energy, Coulomb\nenergy with exchange in the Slater approximation, and an\neffective-interaction part depending on density \u03c1, kinetic\ndensity \u03c4 , l\u2217s density \u0002J , current \u0002\uf6be , and spin density \u0002\u03c3 , for\na detailed explicit expression see, e.g., Ref. [14]. Pairing is\nnot considered in the present case where we deal mostly with\nclosed shell nuclei. For the purpose of later discussions, we\ndisplay here the l\u2217s part of the functional\nEevenls = \u2212\n\u222b\nd3r\n(\nb4\u03c1\u2207 \u00b7 \u0002J + b\u20324\n\u2211\nq\n\u03c1q(\u2207 \u00b7 \u0002Jq)\n)\n, (1)\nE\n(odd)\nls = \u2212\n\u222b\nd3r\n(\nb4 \u0002\u03c3 \u00b7 (\u2207 \u00d7 \u0002\uf6be ) + b\u20324\n\u2211\nq\n\u0002\u03c3q \u00b7 (\u2207 \u00d7 \u0002\uf6beq)\n)\n.\n(2)\nThe index q \u2208 {p, n} labels protons and neutrons. The spec-\nification of the energy-density functional fixes all that is\nneeded for TDHF and the stationary initial states. The TDHF\nequations are derived by time-dependent variation with respect\nto the single-nucleon wavefunctions \u03d5+\u03b1 and the corresponding\nstationary HF equation by analogous stationary variation.\nThe full Skyrme functional and the subsequent TDHF\nequations meet all symmetries of space-time, in particular\ninvariance under Galilei transformations, a condition which\nmust be fulfilled for a meaningful theory of heavy-ion reactions\n[13]. Galilean invariance imposes restrictions on the form of\nthe odd-odd terms, i.e., those terms containing the time-odd\npieces, current \u0002\uf6be and spin density \u0002\u03c3 . This means that the\nkinetic term always appears in the boost-invariant combination\n\u03c1\u03c4 \u2212 \u0002\uf6be 2. Of particular importance here is the correct interplay\nbetween the even-even and odd-odd parts of the l\u2217s term,\nEqs. (1) with (2). We shall now discuss their effect on\nheavy-ion collisions and, in particular, show that their omission\nleads to inconsistencies.\nThe Skyrme functional allows a very precise description\nof nuclear ground state properties and excitations [14]. There\nexists, in fact, a great variety of parametrizations of the Skyrme\nfunctional in the literature which differ in quality and bias\nof fitted data. In order to distinguish generic effects from\nparticularities of a certain parametrization, we considered\nseveral different Skyrme forces and show results for two:\nSkM\u2217 [15] and SLy6 [16]. Calculations with other forces did\nnot differ significantly for the purposes of this work.\n0556-2813\/2006\/74(2)\/027601(4) 027601-1 \u00a92006 The American Physical Society\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 027601 (2006)\nThe practical solution of the TDHF equations employs a\nrepresentation of wavefunctions, potentials, and densities on\na three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate-space grid. Deriva-\ntives are evaluated in Fourier-transformed space using the\nfast Fourier transformation (FFT) [17]. We work with a grid\nspacing of 1 fm. The accelerated gradient iteration is employed\nto find the stationary ground state solution [17,18]. The\nCoulomb field is calculated by solving the Poisson equation\non a grid which is twice as large as the physical grid and\nwith periodic boundary conditions with the method of Ref.\n[19]. Note that the reflection of emitted nucleons from the\nboundaries of the numerical box lead to an uncertainty of\n2\u20133 MeV in the final relative-motion energy, an effect which\nis also seen in giant resonance calculations [20]. A Taylor\nseries expansion up to sixth order of the unitary mean-field\npropagator is used for the dynamical time stepping [21]. The\nconservation of particle number and total energy provides a\nrather stringent check of numerical accuracy. In practice, we\ntune our numerical parameters such that we observe over all\ntime a change in the particle number of less than 0.01, and\na drift in the total energy of less than 0.1 MeV. A time step\nof \u0007t = 0.2 fm\/c was found adequate in all cases considered,\nindependent of the bombarding energy and also of whether the\nodd-odd l\u2217s couplings were included or not.\nThe standard test case throughout this paper is an 16O+16O\ncollision atEc.m. =75\u2013150 MeV. This system is one of the most\nfrequently studied with TDHF and has also been the focus of\ninvestigations of the effect of the l\u2217s force on dissipation [7].\nThe fragment wave functions are placed symmetrically on\nthe grid to an initial center of mass distance of 16 fm and\nthen boosted to the desired relative center-of-mass (c.m.)\nenergy. This prepares the initial state from which the TDHF\npropagation is calculated. We also compare results for systems\nincluding 12C, 13C, and 48Ca in order to get a first impression\nof the systematic variations.\nThe most interesting observable in heavy-ion collisions is\nthe kinetic energy of relative motion of the two fragments.\nThis quantity is deduced using a two-body analysis of the\ntime-dependent density distribution. For this purpose, we\ncalculate the principal axes of the mass quadrupole tensor, then\nexamine the density along the axis of minimum quadrupole\nmoment to find whether it shows the characteristics of two\nmaxima separated by a low-density region. The point of\nlowest density along this line then defines a dividing plane\nperpendicular to this axis, and two fragments are assumed to\nexist on both sides of this plane. Calculating the centers of\nmass of each fragment yields a new straight line connecting\nthem, which is used to repeat the process. This is iterated\nuntil the definitions of the fragment centers of mass and the\ndividing plane have stabilized. The principal result of this\nanalysis are the fragment masses and charges Mi,Qi, i = 1, 2,\nthe separation distance R of the fragments, the relative velocity\n\u02d9R as well as the angular velocity of rotation in the scattering\nplane \u02d9\u03b8 calculated from the positions in two successive time\nsteps. The energy of relative motion can then be calculated\nfrom the radial kinetic and rotational energy of the fragment\nminus the remaining Coulomb interaction. The Coulomb en-\nergy is approximated by the expression for two point charges,\nwhich should be good for larger distances. By comparing this\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\nt [fm\/c]\n26\n27\n28\n29\nT[\nMe\nV]\nCase\nC12\nC13\nO16\nFIG. 1. The c.m. energy of a single free nucleus moving through\nthe grid for three different test cases as indicated. The nearly constant\nlines correspond to the full Skyrme treatment, while the other results\nwere calculated omitting the odd-odd l\u2217s coupling.\nwith the full numeric calculation of the Coulomb interaction\nenergy, we could establish that for R\u0001 12 fm it is accurate\nwithin about 0.02 MeV.\nAs a first critical test, we consider the free translational\nmotion of a nucleus. The results for three different nuclei\nshown in Fig. 1 strikingly illustrate, on the one hand, the\naccuracy of the code, and on the other, the need for odd-odd\ncouplings. If the full Skyrme force is used, the kinetic energy\nof the c.m. just shows small oscillations by |\u0007T | < 0.2 MeV\nin the period covered, while with the odd-odd couplings\nomitted there is an immediate deceleration followed by large\noscillations. At this point we can already conclude that\nthe omission of these terms leads to unacceptable physical\nbehavior.\nThe spurious dissipation is caused by the intrinsic excitation\nof a spin-twist mode. For a nucleus moving with constant\nvelocity \u0002v, the coupling term contains\n\u2207\u00d7 \u0002\uf6be = (\u2207\u03c1)\u00d7\u0002v = d\u03c1\ndr\n\u0002r\u00d7\u0002v\nr\n, (3)\nwhere spherical symmetry was assumed for simplicity. This is\nan azimuthal vector field which thus couples to a spin field of\nthe same character. Omitting the odd-odd coupling thus leads\nto a spurious excitation of a ring-like spin density, which with\nthe full Skyrme force is suppressed by the odd-odd terms.\nAn examination of the spin density in the cases without the\nodd-odd l\u2217s terms shows that the actual excitation of this mode\naccounts for about 95% of the energy loss. The rest is due to\nadditional excitations caused by the deceleration (note that the\ntotal energy is conserved in any case).\nFigure 2 shows the relative c.m. energy for a collision.\nThe initial phase (up to 40 fm\/c) is free c.m. motion of the\ntwo nuclei, and we see again the spurious dissipation of\nc.m. energy as soon as the odd-odd l\u2217s term is omitted. In\ncontrast, the full Skyrme interaction preserves the relative\nmotion energy very well until contact. The bottom part of\nthe figure shows the energy contained in the odd-odd l\u2217s term\n(2). The \u201cno-odd\u201d case shows a substantial increase in that\nenergy which is obviously properly compensated in the full\n027601-2\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 027601 (2006)\n0 50 100 150 200 250\nt [fm\/c]\n-10\n10\n30\n50\n70\n90\n110\n130\nE[\nMe\nV]\nOdd\nNo-oddEcm\nEodd-odd\nFIG. 2.

The energetic relations are reversed in the exit\nchannel. The unphysical case without odd-odd l\u2217s departs\nwith more residual c.m. energy while the full interaction\nproduces more true dissipation. This is caused again by\nthe mechanism sketched in the spin-coupling term (3), but\nnow is not spurious: it occurs because the l\u2217s terms in the\nsingle-particle Hamiltonian and the counterbalancing odd-odd\nl\u2217s coupling come out of synchronization due to the physical\nchange in current pattern during the collision, so that a net\nspin-twist excitation remains. Figure 3 visualizes the pattern\nof the spin-twist excitation in a stage where the two fragments\nstart interacting. This spin density distribution pattern was\nobserved in the numerical results. The excitation persists after\nfull separation. The extra amount of energy stored in this mode\nexplains the enhanced dissipation observed in the exit stages of\nFig. 2. The spin-twist mode and the unambigous detection of\nits deexcitation following a collision certainly deserves further\ndetailed investigations.\nWe have investigated a great variety of central and non-\ncentral collisions at various collisional energies. They all show\nsimilar effects. As one example, Fig. 4 shows the loss of\nc.m. energy versus impact parameter, mainly for SkM\u2217 at\nFIG. 3.

The Skyrme force\nused was SkM\u2217. For comparison, results from Ref. [7] are shown,\nwith and (completely) without l\u2217s-force.\nvarious levels of approximation, one result from SkI3 for\ncomparison, and results from older TDHF studies in axial\napproximation [6,7]. The old calculations were done with a\nvariant of SkM\u2217 replacing the gradient terms by finite folding.\nAt that time, it was great success to include the even-even\nl\u2217s term. This brought a substantial jump in dissipation and\nresolved the puzzle of too much transparency in the then\nolder TDHF calculations. The present calculations without\nodd-odd terms still differ from the previous ones in that they\nare now fully triaxial. This makes no effect at low impact\nparameter (the minor difference is probably due to the folding\napproximation) but a visibly enhanced dissipation for grazing\ncollisions which is reasonable because non-central collisions\nbreak axial symmetry and call for a triaxial treatment. The most\ninteresting effect here is the additional dissipation caused by\nthe step to the full Skyrme functional (compare up-triangles\nwith full dots). It remains very similar up to an impact\nparameter of to about 5 fm which is, not suprisingly, close\nto the nuclear radius. For larger b, it rapidly vanishes as we\nget to peripheral collisions. The spin-twist mode thus leads\nto excitations in the final fragments that remain relevant for a\nlarge range of impact parameters. The most striking effect is\nthe qualitative difference that thew new calculations without\nsymmetry restrictions and with all odd-odd terms included\npredict a large regime of fusion whereas all the other do not.\nWe can estimate a fusion cross section for the system 16O+16O\nat collisional energy of 100 MeV to be somewhat larger than\n500 mb. This compares very well with 550 mb deduced from\nthe systematics of Ref. [22] while all approximate calculations\nfail in that respect. Fig. 4 also shows the result for full SkI3,\nwhich is very similar to SkM\u2217. The same similarity is seen\nfor other forces investigated. Calculations with older Skyrme\nforces showed a much more dramatic and systematic force\ndependence [6,7,23,24].\nThe dependence of the additional dissipation (as compared\nto restricted calculations) on the mass of the colliding nuclei\nwas tested by a few calculations for other collision partners.\n027601-3\nBRIEF REPORTS PHYSICAL REVIEW C 74, 027601 (2006)\nFor 12C on 12C the additional energy loss was similar and\npossibly even larger reaching 30 MeV, and similarly for 12C\non 16O. On the other hand, for 48Ca on 48Ca it was almost\nnegligible with about 1 MeV. The reason for this is not yet\nclear and needs to be investigated.\nIn this work we have investigated the energy loss in\nheavy-ion collisions as described by TDHF handled in full\n3D and including consistently all terms of the given Skyrme\nfunctional. Particular attention was paid to the time reversal\nodd-odd spin-orbit (l\u2217s) term which is often neglected in TDHF\ncalcuations. The main findings can be concluded in brief:\nThe odd-odd l\u2217s terms establish full Galilean invariance of\nthe functional and they are crucial to provide properly free\ntranslation of a nucleus over the grid. The odd-odd l\u2217s terms\nadd substantially to the dissipation observed in heavy-ion\ncollisions. That effect persists up to impact parameters of\norder of the nuclear radius. It is large for small nuclei and\nseems to decrease for heavier ones. The enhanced dissipation\nis associated with the strong excitation of a pronounced\nspin-twist mode which is present even in the collision of\nspin-saturated nuclei and persists after separation in both\nfragments. The two main tasks for future research are:\nfirst, large scale investigations of dissipation under varying\nscattering conditions, and second, a closer inspection of that\nmost interesting spin-twist mode, working out directions for\nan experimental assessment.\nThis work was supported by BMBF under contracts no. 06 F\n131 and 06 ER 808 and the UK EPSRC grant GR\/S96425\/01.\nWe gratefully acknowledge support by the Frankfurt Center\nfor Scientific Computing.\n[1] J.
