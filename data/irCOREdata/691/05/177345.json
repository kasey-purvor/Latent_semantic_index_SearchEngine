Although\nit is difficult to draw a dividing line, it has generally been agreed that the heads of\ndamage are an issue of substance and should be governed by the lcx causae, while the\nquantification of damages is an issue of procedure and should be decided according\nto the lexfori.2 However, the division between substance and procedure is not clear-\ncut. Whether ceilings on damage awards are covered under the \"heads of damage\" or\nthe \"quantification of damages\" is particularly controversial. These issues have been\nexamined in a number of recent English cases. 3 The latest decision, by the House\nof Lords in Harding v Wealands,4 might have been expected to be the last word.\n28 Para 6.65; table 6.27.\n29 Para 6.48.\n30 Para 6.79.\n31 http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.ik\/Topir s\/Jo stice\/criminal\/1 8244\/1706 8\/7188\n1 1lcElroy v McAllister 1949 SC 11(1 at 133 per Lord Keith Boys r Chaplin [1971] AC 356 at 379 per\nLord Hodson.\n2 Dicey, Morris and Collins: Conflict of Las, 14 th edn, by L Collins et al (2006) paras 7-035, 35-053.\n3 Edmunds v Sinootonds [2001] 1 WLR 1003; Rocrig v Valiant Trawlers Ltd 12002] 1 XX LR 2304; Hulse v\nChambers [2001] 1 WLR 2386.\n4 [2006] UKHL 32, [2007] 2 AC 1.\nVol 12 2008 ANALYSIS\nHowever, despite the high status and careful exposition of a unanimous decision, its\nimportance is greatly limited by new European legislation. Contrary to the existing\nScottish (English) rules, the Rome II Regulation provides that the assessment of\ndamages or remedy claimed is governed by the Icx causae.5\nA. HARDING v WEALANDS\n(1) The facts\nIn Hardin- vr Wealands, the claimant, Mr Harding, an Englishman, was rendered\ntetraplegic following an accident in New South Wales caused by the defendant,\nMs Wealands, an Australian national. Mr Harding brought an action in England\nand Ms Wealands conceded liability. Under the law of New South Wales, the\nMotor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 imposes a restriction on the damages\nfor injuries suffered in motor accidents. There is no such restriction in English\nlaw. It was unanimously agreed in the Court of Appeal,' and not questioned in\nthe House of Lords, that the applicable law on the substance was the law of\nNew South Wales. In the Court of Appeal the question came down to the classification\nof assessment of delictual damages. If this was classified as a question of substance,\nthe law of New South Wales law applied, to the advantage of the defendant; if it was\nclassified as procedure, English law applied, to the advantage of the claimant. A\nmajorit-, of the Court of Appeal decided that assessment of damages was an issue\nof substance. The House of Lords unanimously held that assessment of damages is\nprocedural, that a cap on damages is an issue of assessment of damages, and therefore\nthat English law applies to that issue as the lexfori.\n(2) The issues\nIn delivering the leading speech, Lord Hoffmann considered the old choice of\nlaw cases, and concluded that the traditional rule regarded matters of remedy as\nprocedure which is governed by the lex foci. 7 This common law approach had not\nbeen affected by part III of the Private International Law (,Miscellaneous Provisions)\nAct 1995. s Lord Hoffmann then concluded that statutory ceilings on damages\nare matters of procedure rather than substance. 9 Although a report by the Law\nCommissions on Choice of Laic in Tort and Delict had stated that \"a statutory ceiling\non damages is a substantive issue for the applicable law in tort or delict rather than a\n5 Regulation (EC) No 864\/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to\nnon-contractual obligations (Rome II), oJ 2007 L199\/40, art 15(c).\n6 [2005] 1 All ER 415.\n7 [2007] 2 AC 1 at para 24.\n8 Paras 31-38. See the similar reasoning of Lord Rodger at paras 62-69. Only Lord Carswell, at paras\n79-83, felt it necessary to rely on a statement to this effect in the House of Lords during the passage of\nthe Act by Lord Mackay of Clashfem, then Lord Chancellor.\n9 Paras 39-53. On the question of whether a cap on damages is a matter of procedure Lord Woolf\n(para 10) conceded that the answer was not \"obvious', while Lord Hoffmann (para 51) hinted that it\nmight not be the best result but that his job was to preserse the common law nile that \"Parliament\nintended to preserve\" bv the 1995 Act,\nVol 12 2008THE EDINBURGH LAW REVIEW\nprocedural issue for the lexfori\",10 Lord Hoffmann saw this as inconsistent with the\nview in the same report that no changes should be brought to the common law rules\non the question of damages.\" Since the common law classifies all matters relating to\nremedies as procedure, this basic principle should apply.\nThe House of Lords' reasoning is controversial. The substance-procedure line in\nthe common law is ambiguous and unclear. As Lord Pearson said in Boys U: Chaplin,\n\"I do not think there is any exact and authoritative definition of the boundary betaeen\nsubstantive law and procedural (or adjectival or non-substantive) law\".12 There is no\ndoubt that in the 1995 Act Parliament intended assessment of damages to continue to\nbe classified as procedure. However, there is nothing in Lord Mackay's statemcnt, or\nelsewhere in the travaux preparatoires, to indicate that caps on damages fell within\nassessment of damages. Hence the Law Commissions' statement - following on from\nDicey's view that \"statutory provisions limiting a defendant's liability are prima facie\nsubstantive; but the true construction of the statute may negative this view\" 13 _ creates\na strong case for believing that Parliament would have thought that caps on damages\nwere classified as substance.\n(3) The effects\nIn adopting a wide definition of procedure, the House of Lords employed a strict\nreading both of the legislative text and of the pre-1995 common law. Even if Harding\nis correct in law, the appropriateness of this broad classification of procedure seems\nquestionable as a matter of policy.\nFirst of all, it may not be fair to apply different laws to the existence of liability\nand to the remedy. If a cause of action is unknown in Scotland but exists in the\nlex causae, it is hard to use Scots law to assess damages.' 4 In other cases, the lex\nCaustc may adopt strict liability but at the same time introduces a limitation to the\nremedy in order to provide a reasonable balance,' 5 while in the lex foci liability may\nbe based on negligence or even fault, with higher damages being awarded to reflect\nthe higher level of wrongdoing. It is unfair for the defender to be subject both to the\nstrict liability of the lex causae and to the higher damages of the lexfori.\nSecondly, it may be argued that the rule fails to observe the fuiction of the\napplicable law and the lex foci.16 The main rationale for classifing an issue as\n10 Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission, Report on Pitat' International Lair: Choice of Lair\nin Tort and Delict (Law Coin No 193, Scot Law Con No 129, 1990) para 3.39.

The\nRome Convention, which has been implemented by the Contracts (Applicable Law)\nAct 1990, provides that the assessment of damages, insofar as governed by rules of law,\nis governed by the lex causae.2o This ambiguous provision separates the assessment\nof damages into t-Wo categories, namely the rules of law and the questions of fact. The\nfirst category, which surely covers statutory restrictions on damages, is classified as\nsubstance and governed by the lex cao sae.21\nFourthly, the inclusion of statutory restrictions on damages as procedure makes the\nscope of procedure unreasonably wide. The classification can be seen as a parochial\ndevice to limit the effects of the lex causae by extending the application of the\nlex fori,2 2 when, as Anton notes, \"the constant aim of the Scottish courts should\nbe to restrict\" the domain of procedure. \"To classify a foreign rule as procedural is to\nexcept it from its normal application in Scotland and, on general principles, exceptions\nare to be strictly interpreted.\"-23\nFifthly, the current approach may open the door for forum shopping, especially\nwhen discretion to decline jurisdiction has been largely barred by the European\njurisdiction system. 2 4\nB. ROME II REGULATION\nAbout twelve months after the decision in Harding u Wealands, the Rome II\nRegulation was adopted by the Council of the European Union and approved by the\n17 See Anton's test of applying the foreign rules unless it is \"impracticable\" to do so within the terms\nof Scottish procedures: see Priuate International Law, 1I edn (1967) 542.

Like the\ntraditional Scottish (and English) rules, the Rome II Regulation divides substance\nand procedure, and leaves the issue of procedure to the law of the forum. 26 However,\nit further provides that \"the existence, the nature and the assessment of damages or\nremedy claimed\" should be governed by the lex causae.27 No guidance is provided as\nto what constitutes \"the assessment of damages or remedy claimed\", but the words\nused are wide enough to cover all matters relating to damages, including what have\nbeen traditionally classified as procedural issues in Scotland. Under the Rome II\nRegulation the issue of damages is no longer a mixture of substance and procedure,\nbut a unitary package, which is classified as \"substance\" and governed by the\n1ex causae. As a result, the importance of Harding c Wcalands has been greatly\nlimited.\n(1) Observations on the Rome II classification\nThe Rome II Regulation overturns the highly controversial rules in the UK.\nBy classifying 'all matters relating to damages as substantive, it adopts a narrow\ndefinition of \"procedure\", which is compatible with the practice in most of continental\nEurope. As already mentioned, it is not the best solution to classify assessment of\ndamages as procedure. In addition, there are both theoretical and pragmatic reasons\nto classify remedies as substance. First of all, the remedy is an inseparable part of the\nright.28 The restriction of assessment of damages can be regarded as a restriction of\nthe right itself\nSecondly, applying the lex causae to both the heads and the assessment of damages\nis more desirable for the purposes of private international law. The function of choice\nof law is to select a law that is \"most appropriate\" to decide a dispute. The 'x causae\nshould have a wide scope of application and only in exceptional circumstances should\nits effect be declined. While the lex fori is often an \"'appropriate\" system of Las to\ngovern a dispute, this is not always the case because exorbitant rules of jurisdiction still\nexist and because an acceptable basis of jurisdiction, such as the defender's domicile,\nis not usually as appropriate a law to govern a delictual dispute as the law of the place\nof damage (the main rule in article 4 of Rome II).\nThirdly, the unitary solution provided by the Rome II Regulation avoids the vexed\nissue of how to draw a line between substance and procedure within damages. In\nmost cases the lines between the heads of damage, the remoteness of damage, and\nthe assessment of damage are vague. There are a number of borderline issues in\naddition to ceilings and floors of damages.\n25 n 5.\n26 Art 1(3).\n27 Art 15(c).\n28 Panagopoulos (n 22) at 77.\nVol112 2008 ANALYSIS\n(2) Some problems\nAlthough the Rome II Regulation brings simplicity and clarity into a traditionally\nvexed area, certain new problems are also created. One of the reasons that the UK\nParliament classified the assessment of damages as procedure and applied the lexfori\nwas to avoid excessive awards of damages. In the debate on the 1995 Act, the Lord\nChancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, warned against bringing \"American scales of\ncompensation into English courts\".29 The lex causae may award punitive damages or\neven just levels of damages classified as compensatory but at excessively high levels\nby Scottish standards. By classifying assessment of damages as a matter of substance,\nthe Rome II Regulation creates the possibility that Scottish courts will have to make\nextremely high damages awards when applying certain foreign laws. The difference\nbetween two legal systems on the assessment of damages will not be considered\nexcessive or unendurable in most cases. However, when this difference is so extreme\nthat it would be contrary to the fundamental policy or public interest of the forum,\nthe forum should be able to find a way to reduce the level of damages awarded to a\nlevel consistent with its public policy.\nThe public policy exception in the Rome II Regulation has to be read in the light\nof recital :32. It provides that:\nthe application of a provision of the law designated by this Regulation which would have the\neffect of causing non-compensatory exemplar\\, or punitive damages of an excessive nature\nto be awarded may, depending on the circumstances of the case and the legal order of\nthe Member State of the court seised, be regarded as being contrary to the public policy\n(ordre public) of the forum.\nThis recital is drafted in a way that seeks to avoid the European Court of Justice giving\na uniform interpretation of when excessive damages are contrary to public policy by\nsaying that the issue is not only case-specific but also varies depending on the \"legal\norder of the Member State of the court seised\". Part of the sensitivity here is that\nseveral legal systems in the EU award exemplary or punitive damages in certain cases.\nThus it was unacceptable to categorise all exemplary or punitive damages as contrary\nto public policy but only \"excessive\" damages in those categories. A telling omission\nfrom the recital is the idea that public policy could be used to reduce damages awards\nthat are compensatory under the lex causae but excessively beyond the amount that\nthe lex fori would regard as necessar' to compensate the victim. This might lead\ncourts to classify the part of a damages award they believe to be excessive as exemplary\nor punitive even though it would be classified as compensatory by the lex causae. This\nis an unfortunate temptation to keep playing the classification game.\nAnother problem with applying the lex causae to assessment of damages is that the\nawards might be much lower than under the lexfori. This might result in those living\nin the forumn receiving inadequate compensation because the higher costs in that\njurisdiction are not anticipated by the applicable law.30 The European Parliament,\n29 Quoted in Harding r \\Vealands [2007] 2 AC 1 at para 37.\n:30 Lord Rodger highlights this problern in Harding v W alands [2007] 2 AC 1 at para 70.\nVol 12 2008THE EDINBURGH LAW REVIEW',\nconcerned about this problem in the context of traffic accidents, introduced recital\n33 providing as follows:\nAccording to the current national rules on compensation awarded to victims of road traffic\naccidents, when quantifying damages for personal injury in cases in which the accident\ntakes place in a State other than that of the habitual residence of the \\ictim, the court\nseised should take into account all the relevant actual circumstances of the specific victim,\nincluding in particular the actual losses and costs of after-care and medical attention.\n31\nThe problem with this recital is that it does not link to any substantive provision\nof the Regulation. It attempts to say what national substantive law should do, whereas\nthe Regulation only helps to determine which law applies to the dispute and not what\nthe content of that law should be.\n(3) Some exceptions\nThe Rome II Regulation provides a different classification for the assessment of\ndamages than the prior Scots law However, some non-contractual obligations,\nnotably defamation and other privacy-related delicts, are excludedf 2 and the Harding\nclassification will continue to apply. This means that, while the assessment of damages\nwill be classified as substance and governed by the applicable law in most delictual\ncases, such as traffic accidents, product liability, and environmental damages, in\ncases such as defamation the assessment of damages will continue to be classified as\nprocedure. It is doubtful whether such mixed and inconsistent rules are appropriate\nin the future, and the UK legislatures should think carefully about the best solution in\nareas outside the scope of Rome II when repealing part III of the 1995 Act. However,\nthe political lobby that ensured defamation was outwith the scope of Rome I is likely\nto prevent the extension of the Rome II rules by UK legislation.\nPaul Beaumont and Zheng Tang\nUniversity of Aherdeen\nEdinLR Vol 12 pp 137-144\nDOI: 10.3366\/E 1364980908000206\nThe Scottish Parliament Elections 2007 - what kind\nof hackery is this?*\nTo put electoral law at the front and centre of popular discourse is no mean\nfeat, and rarely bodes well.
