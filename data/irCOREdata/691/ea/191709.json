To date, one of the main methods for \nchoosing agents to investigate in trials has been retrospective population-based \nanalysis of an apparent association between ingestion of the agent and a \nreduced incidence of cancer.  Unfortunately such analyses are often flawed by \nmany sources of bias.  In addition, adverse effects of exposure to such agents \nover a protracted period have not been anticipated.  Successful chemoprevention \nrequires an agent which has a significant impact on cancer risk but is also \nextremely safe and well tolerated.  With the increasing understanding of \nmolecular mechanisms leading to carcinogenesis, it is imperative that cancer \npreventive agents are developed more rationally and are targeted towards these \nmechanisms \u2013 both to increase efficacy and also to reduce the potential for \ntoxicity.  This article will highlight some of the more promising potential targets \nwhich can be used to choose and design drugs for testing as chemopreventive \nagents.  The identification of targets could also enable the development of \nbiomarkers to test efficacy during early clinical development. \n \nMolecular targets for chemopreventive agents \nPhenotypic and genotypic alterations occur during carcinogenesis and lead to the \nfeatures which define a malignant cell.  One of these involves abnormalities in \nthe survival pathways which enable malignant cells to avoid apoptosis.  Among \nthe best described survival pathways are those involving the growth factor \nreceptor (GFR)\/Ras\/Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway,[4]  \nphophotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)\/protein kinase B(Akt)[5]  and signal \nH:\/WPS\/Molecular targets for chemoprevention: role in choosing and developing new agents 160407 1 \ntransducers and activators of transcription (STATs) [6]  or nuclear factor \u03baB(NF-\n\u03baB).[7]    \n \nSignalling through the GFR\/Ras\/MAPK pathway is central to regulating cell \ngrowth and several growth factors activate the pathway.  In many malignancies \nthere is amplification or over expression of GFRs and oncogenic Ras leading to \ncontinuous activation of the pathway.  The PI3K\/Akt pathway appears to be \ncentral to survival of malignant cells with activation blocking a number of \nmechanisms that would normally induce apoptosis or lead to cell cycle arrest in \ndamaged cells.  Malignant cells are frequently associated with over expression or \nincreased activation of different components of this pathway.  The transcription \nfactor NF-\u03baB has been increasingly studied in recent years and appears to be \ncentral to promoting tumour cells in malignancies which are associated with \ninflammation.  Normally, NF-\u03baB is associated with I\u03baB which leads to its \ninactivation.  During malignancy, I\u03baB can be inactivated and degraded, freeing \nNF-\u03baB to translocate of the nucleus where it can promote transcription to several \ndifferent genes that lead to induction of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis.  \nThere has been increasing demonstration of deregulation of this pathway in \nmalignancy.  The STATs pathways are involved in the regulation of gene \ntranscription in response to cytokine or growth factor stimulation of a variety of \nreceptors.  They appear to become overactive in several malignancies.  This can \nlead to the prevention of apoptosis through increased expression of anti-\napoptotic proteins such as Bcl2 and Bclx1. \n \nCell cycle regulation \nOne of the hallmarks of malignancy is a loss of regulation of cell cycle \nprogression.  Several proteins have been identified which regulate progression \nthrough the cell cycle and a group of molecules, the cyclins and cyclin-dependent \nkinases have been extensively investigated in recent years.  Cyclin D1 is a rate-\nlimiting factor in progression of cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle.[8]   Its \nover expression is associated with carcinogenesis \u2013 particularly in breast and \nH:\/WPS\/Molecular targets for chemoprevention: role in choosing and developing new agents 160407 2 \nprostate cancer.  Another target protein involved with cell cycle progression is \nactivator protein-1 (AP-1).[9]   A variety of growth factors and oncoproteins are \npotent inducers of AP-1 activity.  AP-1 appears to be involved in the regulation of \ngenes involved with apoptosis and cell cycle progression by activating the cyclin \nD1 gene.  It also has effects at repressing tumour-suppressor genes including \np53.  It may also have a role in controlling metastasis. \n \nThe tumour suppressor gene, p53, provides another potential target for \nchemoprevention.  It regulates many cell processes including signal transduction, \nresponses to DNA damage, cell cycle control and apoptosis.  p53 mutations are \nfound in most tumour types and appear to have numerous roles in \ncarcinogenesis. \n \nGrowth factor signalling pathways \nMany growth factors have been implicated in carcinogenesis and include \nepidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), \ntransforming growth factors (TGF) \u2013 \u03b1 and \u03b2 and insulin like growth factor (IGF).  \nMany tumours appear to progress as a result of increased activation of \ndownstream signalling from activation of the receptors.  These result in increased \ncell proliferation and suppression of apoptosis together with an increased \npotential for invasion and metastasis.  Agents targeted at the EGF receptor \n(EGFR) may result in apoptosis of cancer cells. \n \nCyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) \nThe cycloxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) have been an increasing focus as \ntargets for chemopreventive drug development.[10]   These enzymes are \nresponsible for converting arachadonic acid into prostatglandins.  COX-2 is \noverexpressed in almost every pre-malignant and malignant cell.  Several \nmechanisms associated with the activity of COX-2 in neoplasia have been \ndefined in recent years and these include induction of resistance to apoptosis, \nH:\/WPS\/Molecular targets for chemoprevention: role in choosing and developing new agents 160407 3 \npromotion of angiogenesis, increase in DNA mutagenesis and increased \ninvasiveness and reduced adhesion of epithelial cells. \n \nUse of molecular targets to identify chemopreventive agents \nAn understanding of the multiple molecular pathways on targets which are \nderegulated during carcinogenesis enables in vitro and in vivo assays to be \ndeveloped to screen potential chemopreventive agents before further \ndevelopment occurs.  An understanding of the importance of increased \nexpression of COX-2 has led to the in vitro testing of several agents for their \neffects on COX-2 expression.  Modulation of this enzyme increases the potential \ninterests of an agent as would measured effects on cell proliferation and survival \nand markers of apoptosis.  Several groups have also developed assays of DNA \ndamage and modification of the level of damage by potential chemopreventive \nagents may further add to their interest for future development.  Such in vitro \nassays clearly have limitations but, positive results taken together with effects on \nanimal model systems (eg transgenic or carcinogen-induced models of \nmalignancy) can provide sufficient rationale for the development of trials in \nhumans.  Of increasing importance is the development of biomarkers of efficacy \nin human studies.  Chemoprevention trials which use cancer incidence as an \nendpoint require prolonged follow up and large numbers of individuals.  The use \nof surrogate biomarkers which may involve modification of molecular targets of \ncarcinogenesis can be measured in humans before and after exposure to a new \npotential chemopreventive agent and can give much earlier indications of \npotential efficacy. \n \nThe field of Chemoprevention is thus beginning to benefit from the incorporation \nof an understanding of molecular targets for drug development.  The increasing \nincorporation of the understanding of such molecular targets should markedly \nimprove the ability to identify appropriate agents for trials and should speed up \nthe determination of clinical efficacy in the future.   \n \nH:\/WPS\/Molecular targets for chemoprevention: role in choosing and developing new agents 160407 4 \nConflict of Interest Statement: \nThe author has no financial or personal conflicts of interest with other people or \norganisations which could inappropriately influence his work to disclose. \n \nReferences \n1.
