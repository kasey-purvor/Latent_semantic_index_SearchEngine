Soper and Alexander B. MacDonald\nDepartment of Economics, Leicester University, UK\nAbstract\nUnder the TLTP initiative, the Economics Consortium is developing an interactive computer-\nbased learning package called WinEcon. The package is directed at first-year economics\nundergraduates, particularly those taking economics as a supplementary course. Using recent\ntechnological developments, the aim is both to facilitate a further increase in student numbers\nwithout a proportionate increase in teaching staff, and to provide a better method of student\nlearning. Some key elements of WinEcon are set out in this paper and demonstrated by screens\nproduced at Leicester University. Methods of presenting textual information that give the user\ncontrol over accessing it are described. For learning difficult concepts, a visual active\nlearning approach is discussed. It involves user interaction and step-by-step analysis. The\nimportance of flexibility and choice is emphasized, and the capacity of the computer to assist\nin deepening and consolidating learning is shown.\nIntroduction\nWinEcon is a software package offering a new and interactive approach to learning econom-\nics for students taking a first-year university course. It is being developed by the Economics\nConsortium as part of the Teaching and Learning Technology Programme (TLTP) set up in the\nUK by the Higher Education Funding Councils. The authoring package chosen by the Consor-\ntium is Asymetrix Toolbook which runs under Windows, and the Consortium software con-\ntains many graphical user-interface features that will be familiar to any Windows user.\nStudents using WinEcon work at their own pace, and can adopt either an inquisitive or an\nacquisitive approach. They progress through colourful and varied computer screens, choosing\nwhat they would like to look at next, and whether they wish to receive further information.\nDifferent types of feedback are provided to students about their progress. Some screens\nchange their appearance to indicate what the student has done. Others indicate whether an\nanswer or a curve movement is correct, and provide either a hint or the correct answer. Menus\nof different styles in different contexts allow students to select the particular aspect of a topic\nthey wish to study, and pop-ups activated by buttons present key concepts in an arresting way.\nEconomic analysis is explained with animated graphics, and diagrams are built up in stages\n14\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nadding one curve at a time. One of the advantages in developing the package as part of a\nconsortium is cross-fertilization of ideas and cross-checking of the work produced.\nMaterials for WinEcon are being produced separately at different sites, with central co-\nordination and leadership from the University of Bristol. A common look-and-feel has been\nachieved by providing all developers with a core template which customizes Toolbook to\nstandards agreed by the Consortium, and which also provides additional facilities. Under this,\nfor example, all screens use a grey textured background and have the same set of buttons in\nthe bottom window bar. These allow the student to access utilities such as the glossary, and to\nnavigate through the package, moving either to an adjacent screen or to a higher-level menu.\nThe topics described here were authored at Leicester University, and the screens illustrate\nparticular principles of common interest to many different university disciplines which we\nwere concerned to address. (The screens are taken from topics in both the Welfare Economics\nand Regulation of Markets and Market Failure modules, two of the three modules being\ndeveloped at Leicester.)\nObjectives\nThe objective of the funding bodies is to harness technological potential so as to enable an\nincrease in student numbers to take place without an accompanying proportionate increase in\nthe number of teachers. Members of the Economics Consortium envisage that the computer-\nbased learning package they are authoring will replace some lectures, but that its greater\nimpact will be in substituting for labour-intensive tutorials and classes, and in checking and\nassessing students' progress. Equally importantly, however, the Consortium regards the\nsoftware design process as an opportunity to develop better methods of learning. Under-\nstanding and retention of material is greater when students are actively involved in the\nlearning process. Students using WinEcon cannot be passive observers, because progression\nthrough each screen and on to the next requires some meaningful user-interaction such as\nclicking with the mouse or typing appropriate responses. To prevent responses from becoming\nautomatic, the designers of WinEcon have required a considerable variety of types of user-\nFigure 1: Presenting\ntextual information -\nMethod 1\n01993.

A computer perhaps\nlacks the ability to inspire, but it can present all the basic material in an interesting way. The\nauthors of WinEcon aim to set out the main points clearly and to present information in a way\nthat is easy to absorb. An acquisitive student will progress steadily through the material on a\nscreen, and move on to the next screen of the topic. The software will introduce the main\nideas, help students through difficult aspects and suggest avenues for further study both within\nand outside the package. Moreover, the advantage of the computer is that it provides a visual\napproach where the inquisitive student can construct and deconstruct diagrams or graphs, and\nimmediately observe the effect of doing so. The comparative advantage of the computer over\nthe lecture, textbook or tutorial is this dynamic element which proves so elusive to other\nmedia. The principles involved are an extension of those formulated in developing the use of\nspreadsheets in the learning process. It was seen then that by working through a calculation\none step at a time the student gained insight into it (Soper and Lee 1990).\nFlexibility extends the life and widens the usefulness of a software package. The designers of\nWinEcon are building flexibility into it in various ways. Screens are being designed to\naccommodate the updating of information as this becomes necessary, and to give students\nmany alternative access points. Lecturers will be able to customize the package to suit their\nparticular lecture course. These features will widen WinEcon's appeal, and ensure it can offer\nsomething to people with different backgrounds in economics. This is further enhanced by the\ninclusion of More and Advanced buttons. The More button will give the student access to\nanother layer of information on a specific topic. By contrast the Advanced button will allow\nthose students with a strong background in economics to explore topics in greater depth,\ntypically one which is beyond the requirements of the\" mainstream first-year course (for\nexample, the diagrammatic analysis may be made more precise using calculus).\n16\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nPresenting textual information\nThe design of screens such as those shown in Figures 1 and 2 is driven by two complementary\nfactors: user-interaction and the physical size of the screen. A concern of the WinEcon authors\nis that in those cases where topics are particularly textual, the package should not take the\nform of an electronic book. Thus, where there is a large volume of text to be presented which\ncannot be separated between screens, it should be set out in a way which allows the user to\naccess it in logical chunks. This requires the text to be broken down into meaningful sections,\nthe sum of which, when combined with the control the user has over access, is hopefully\nworth more to the student than just the whole text. Naturally, the physical size of the screen\nimposes some constraint on how these elements of text can be presented by the software\nauthor. In Figure 1 the sheer volume of material requires a pop-up mechanism so that the bulk\nof the information, which is stored 'behind the scenes'\" can be accessed one part at a time. In\nFigure 2, the volume of material permits it all to be physically on the same screen, but in such\na way that the user has to get involved with the package in order to read it. On both screens,\nthe user has a visual reminder of exactly what information has been accessed.\nFigure 1 is a screen-shot from the topic on the structure of taxation. This page gives students\ninformation about the types of taxes in the UK. The screen explains what direct taxes, wealth\ntaxes and indirect taxes are, giving the major examples of taxes in each category. The student\ncan click the green circle button adjacent to a tax name to find out more about that tax, and a\nblack centre will appear in the circle, indicating that the student has displayed the further\ninformation about that tax. The student can move to a new screen at any time. If later the\nstudent returns to this screen, then provided that he or she has not quit the package in the\nmeantime, the record of what has previously been studied will still be available.\nCareful planning of the screen design and programming will make the WinEcon package\nflexible. This is particularly important with screens such as that shown in Figure 1 where the\ninformation will require frequent updating. Information which is likely to change often, such\nas tax rates and allowances, will be held in a database for easy updating (subject to the\nobvious constraint of volume of data). The whole screen is designed so that any major\nFigure 3: Clear\npresentation of\ncontrasting definitions\n01 993.

This\nincludes the \"Robin Hood\"\nprinciple of taking from the\nrich and erring to the poor, i\n17\nJean Soper and Alexander MacDonald An interactive approach to learning economics\nchanges, such as the addition or removal of tax examples, can be implemented using only one\naccess point. For users in countries other than the UK it will be possible to substitute an\nalternative screen relevant to their country for that shown in Figure 1.\nAn alternative method of presenting textual information in organized and easy-to-assimilate\nchunks is shown in Figure 2. Here, a card-index type approach is used, with the information\nabout each requirement of a tax system being available on one or two cards. The user clicks a\ncard to view it, and its title bar then changes from cream to green, thus creating a record of\nwhat has been studied. Even in screens which are concerned with presenting text, students are\ninvolved in the learning process, and have a choice about the material presented to them. The\npackage is therefore useful to students with different amounts of prior knowledge, and the\nchoices it offers give easy access to selected material for revision purposes.\nThe screen shown in Figure 3 presents two definitions. Typically, definitions in WinEcon are\naccessed at the click of a standard Definition button on the first page of each topic. In this\ncase, the topic is based on two definitions of equity which are presented together so that they\njointly form the focus of the screen, rather than being supplementary information to be\naccessed via the click of a button. The screen in Figure 3 illustrates the design objective that\nthe software should draw attention to important points, present them clearly, and compare and\ncontrast alternatives.\nAnother feature of WinEcon, implemented via the core template, is the 'Roladex' mechanism\nfor presenting voluminous text. Roladex is the metaphor adopted by the Economics Consor-\ntium to describe its linear-access card mechanism (unlike the HyperCard system, Roladex\ndoes not facilitate random access of cards). Roladex can be seen in Figures 4a and 4b, at the\nupper left-hand side of both screens. With this mechanism, the user clicks the appropriate\nbutton to access sections of text as a linear progression of cards. In Figure 4b, the student is\nreading the sixth card out of the total of the six cards available.\nAs with the other card mechanisihs, large sections of text are presented in smaller, more\nreadable divisions. A particularly attractive feature of the Roladex mechanism is that move-\nment from one card to the next can trigger another event on the same screen. In this way, a\nClick tratton t below and observe what\nhappeas lathe allocations\nThis morement is a Pareto\nteen nude better off, no one has bean\nAllocation of Goods, A , \u2022\njT] |\nFigure 4a: Learning the\ntheory by example\n18\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nstudent can progress through several cards of text which relate to the same diagram while that\ndiagram remains on the screen. At the same time, additions can be made to the diagram (or\nthings can be removed), such as the plotting of a new equilibrium point or the introduction of\na new curve or graphic.\nThe methods chosen by the Economics Consortium for presenting textual information recog-\nnize that a computer screen is not necessarily a suitable medium for conveying the written\nword. Care is being taken to improve readability by separating the text into logical divisions,\nand by using sans-serif fonts for clarity. When continuous text is printed, a serif font is\ngenerally recommended as assisting the flow of reading. On screen, however, the extra\ncomplexity of the serif font makes the letters somewhat disjointed, and so the text becomes\ndifficult to read. The fonts being used by the Economics Consortium are standardized in the\ncore template. They comprise Arial fonts in three different sizes and faces for different\ncircumstances, for example titles, headings, graphs and continuous text.\nInteractive learning of concepts\nA concept which is difficult to grasp can first be demonstrated as an interactive example on a\ncomputer. With the screen shown in Figures 4a and 4b, students investigate the Pareto crite-\nrion for comparing different allocations of two goods between two people. Before entering\nthis screen, the student is given the opportunity to customize the example by changing the\nnames of the people in it. These names then replace the default names in the text and on the\ngraph. On the screen shown in Figure 4a, the user is asked to click button I to see an example\nof a Pareto improvement. This is demonstrated by both the marker at point A turning red and\nmoving from point A to point B, while simultaneously the pie chart at the bottom of the\nscreen slowly changes to reflect the new allocation of goods between the two people.\nProgressing through the text, the student is instructed to click the remaining buttons to\ndiscover more about Pareto improvements. When button V is clicked, as instructed iri the\nscreen shown in Figure 4b, the point moves from A to E, which is on the same line as B, and\nthe pie chart changes accordingly. It might superficially seem that another Pareto improve-\nFigure 4b: Learning the\ntheory by example\n01993.

This, however, is not so. As the text explains, one person, Ziggy, has been\nmade worse off, and therefore the two points A and E cannot be compared using the Pareto\ncriterion. .\nAnother illustrative example is shown in Figures 5a and 5b. These screens incorporate a\nfurther design principle of the package, namely increasing the depth of learning by checking\nthe student's understanding of concepts as they are applied in a new context. The two screens\nshown form part of a set in which the student views four possible alternative allocations of a\ncake between two identical people, and is asked to respond to questions about each allocation\nby clicking the Yes or No button. The separate ideas of equity and efficiency should already\nbe familiar to the student, but these screens require them to be brought together. In Figure 5a,\nthe user has clicked the button Allocation One, which causes a whole cake to divide and then\nbe allocated as shown. In this case, the student has answered the first question by clicking\neither Yes or No (the corresponding pair of buttons are now greyed out), and WinEcon is now\nready to receive the answer to the second question. Figure 5b shows Allocation Two when the\nstudent has revealed the new allocation and answered the question concerning equity. Regard-\nless of what the student chooses, the correct answer appears in the Allocation Status box and\nsubsequent correct answers are added to describe the allocation. To help the student answer\nthe questions, the box at the top right of the screen records numerically the allocations of cake\nfor each example. When the student has completed all the allocations, feedback is provided\nabout how many answers were correct, and an opportunity to repeat the questions is given.\nMonitoring and feedback\nInteractive software such as WinEcon is designed to involve students in their own learning in\na variety of ways. One of these is their responding to the feedback which the computer offers\nthem about their progress.\nWith the screens shown in Figures 5a and 5b, the student receives immediate feedback about\nthe correct answer to each question. Each is used in constructing a final answer, and the\nscreen designers felt it important that students should have the correct information, although\nO1993, TLTP Economics Consortium\n'.Horizontal Equity-Examples;;\" \u2022 .:\n. c W ^ f b e allocation ofiniscakebetweeoiwo\n' i d e n t i c a l s a n n f o . . \"\u2022' .

For acquisitive students proceeding through the steps\non the screen, it is helpful that they are told at the end how many of their answers were\ncorrect. This will alert them to the state of their understanding of the topic.\nWe have considered the possible provision of rewards for full marks on questions sets.\nMachines with sound cards might play a tune of the student's choice (assuming headphones\nare also provided) or some fun item might appear on the screen, possibly a game. For less\nsuccessful students, we have discussed whether some humorous portrayal of their deficiencies\nmight make them feel prepared to try again. Further consideration will be given to feedback\nas we produce the test module, which is still under development at the time of writing.\nAnother aspect of computer-based learning is computer monitoring. The computer can record\nwhat individual students do, so that an account of the screens they have accessed, the infor-\nmation they have revealed and the answers they have given to questions can be available to\nthem. It could also be made available to the students' tutors, but whether it should be is a\nmatter for debate which should perhaps be decided separately at each institution that installs\nthe software. Computer monitoring is something the Consortium plans to consider in more\ndetail once the main software development phase is nearing completion.\nStep-by-step analysis of complex material\nMuch economic analysis is presented by means of graphs, and students have to understand\nwhat each curve on a graph represents. One of the advantages of a computer is that it can\nshow in a matter of seconds how a particular graph is built up, whereas a textbook would\nrequire several pages of text to describe it. Figure 6 shows the start of a diagram for a per-\nfectly competitive industry. The screen invites the user to click the five buttons in sequence,\nwhich builds up the graph one curve at a time. After the first button has been clicked, the\nscreen displays the Industry Demand curve as shown in Figure 6, with an explanation about\nthe curve appearing in the box to the side of the buttons. The student can watch the graph\nbeing built up until the long-run equilibrium position of a perfectly competitive industry is\nfound. For those already familiar with the basic curves, a Show Curves button is provided.\nFigure 5b: Simple\npresentation of hard-to-\ngrasp concepts\n01993, TLTP Economics Consortium\nHorizontal JEcfuity -\none cakB between 1wo \u2022\nAllocation Two\nALLOCATION: PFRSON1 PERSON 2\nONE 1\/3 1\/3\nTWO 1\/2 1\/3\nTHREE\nFOUR\nbartons\n. , \/ -\nfedn* fc? rickino tip spprop'iote\nThis allocation b Equitable\nand more efficient than allocation one\nI t \u00ab a Pareto Optimal allocation\nUnallocated\nAllocation Status INEQUITABLE as one person has\nmore fake than the other\nES naniia I H\n21\nJean Soper and Alexander MacDonald An interactive approach to learning economics\n\u00a91993, TLTP Economics Consortium\nPerfectly Competitive Industry\nWestat) Wisfcapelfcctty-\nb\n\u2022fm a jjMdei of Ste tri<taa\u00bbsr *>\u201e\nJoag m OftdSbnam-, - - 1 >',\"* -\ndick flw'Sw feWsos tetowin \u2022\nj Industry Ui'mand j\nIndustry Supply\nIndustry Murqirm Perfectly Competitive Industry\nIndustry Averngr Cast\nequilibrium Industry demand is a standard demand curve.\nFigure 6: Adding curves\nto build a graph\nThe computer-based learning approach is more visual than the textbook one, and it is also\nflexible to the needs and wishes of the student.\nGuiding the student one step at a time through complex material is the approach that a\nlecturer or tutor would use when teaching the subject live. An economics teacher would also\nindicate points, distances and area on graphs that have particular interpretations. The compu-\nter can do this also. We have already noted that different colours can be used, but the screen\nshown in Figure 7 has a further method. As the student clicks each button in turn to reveal the\ndefinition of a concept, the area or distance which represents that concept on the graph flashes\nto attract the student's attention and ensure that it is correctly identified. In the screen shown\nin Figure 7, the student has clicked the Consumer Surplus button, and then on clicking the\nProducer Surplus button, the text shown appears one step at a time while simultaneously the\ncorresponding lines and axis labels flash.\nThe conclusions of economic analysis are often deduced by comparing two contrasting\ndiagrams. When a perfectly competitive industry is monopolized, there are many points of\ncomparison to be drawn. Figure 8 shows a screen where the student observes the differences\nbetween the two industries. Having clicked buttons (obscured in the screen-shot) to reveal the\ncompetitive equilibrium and set the condition required to determine production under a\nmonopoly (the MR curve, which diverges from AR, is needed), the student then progresses\nthrough the buttons to reveal changes in price, quantity and surpluses as a result of monopoli-\nzation. As each button is clicked, a pop-up completes the button caption so as to explain what\nis happening in the diagram as each component is revealed.\nScreen design\nAspects of screen design relating to readability, flexibility and choice are discussed in the\nearlier section of this paper on presenting textual information. Some more general issues of\nscreen design will now be addressed.\n22\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nThe Economics Consortium recognized at an early stage of production that a degree of\nconsistency between screens would be desirable, for both aesthetic and practical reasons. The\nformer are concerned with giving unity to the package as a whole, and the latter with ensuring\nthat students feel in control of WinEcon. In particular, students need to know firstly where to\nbegin on a new screen, and secondly when they have completed it and should move on to the\nnext. There are also good reasons, however, for believing that a variety of screen styles is\nrequired. Different developers author in different ways, each of which may have its own\nadvantages, so allowing developers freedom to try out their ideas is likely to enrich the\npackage as a whole. Consistency between sites is not necessarily jeopardized by this, because\nideas originating at one site are often adapted at another, with the Janet network facilitating\nfrequent exchange of programming code. As educators, we are also concerned to produce a\npackage which will maintain students' attention and prevent them from predicting exactly\nwhat will follow next, which is a further argument for variety between screens. The Econom-\nics Consortium's approach to this multi-faceted question is a fairly minimal amount of\nstandardization comprising such items as icons, fonts, a screen background, some buttons and\ncommonly required graphics. The scope for variety that is still available to developers is\nillustrated by the considerable Variety of styles exhibited even in the limited number of\nscreens depicted in this paper.\nA major design consideration is to partition the screen in such a way that the eye is not\noverworked. In WinEcon, screens are often divided into a number of unequal sections which\nserve different purposes. Frequently, a large part of the screen is devoted to presenting the\ntextual analysis, with a similarly sized area containing the diagram. A small portion of the\nscreen is typically given up to user instruction. Throughout WinEcon, such areas are identi-\nfied by Professor Fields, an example of which can be seen in the top left-hand corner of the\nscreen in Figure 8. By this means, the student'will quickly become familiar with where to\nlook for screen instructions, and additionally the student can choose the identity of the\nProfessor during the initial customization of WinEcon. Another different use for which a small\nsection of the screen may be required is to store information or present it in a different format\nfor reference purposes. Alternatively, a set of buttons with which the student controls the\nFigure 7: Attracting the\nuser's attention by\nflashing objects on\nscreen\n01993.

The division of the screen may be most\nimportant on screens which contain purely textual information. As with the printed word, the\nless clutter on a page the more willing is the reader to engage that page. Thus, although a\nscreen may contain vast amounts of information, it should be presented so that superficially it\nappears simple and uninvolved, thus capturing the'user's interest at first sight.\nColours can also be used to attract the user's attention, but care must be taken to ensure that\nthe student is not entering the world of psychedelia. If a strong colour is to be used to high-\nlight a particular aspect of analysis, this should be done subtly so that the eye is naturally\ndrawn to that object or area of the screen. If the whole screen is a wash of vibrant colour,\nalthough such a screen will undoubtedly capture the user's initial interest, the power of colour\nin retaining that interest throughout the analysis is lost as the user's eyes become tired when\ncontinually faced with strong screen colours. The Economics Consortium has chosen a neutral\ngrey colour for screen backgrounds, allowing developers a wide choice of colours that stand\nout against it. The use of a subtly textured grey background contrasts well with metallic\nbuttons and dithered backdrops for graphs and diagrams. In this way, the student does not\nhave to deal with the author's overworked imagination but can concentrate on the analysis\n.being presented.\nFlexibility and choice\nVery large textbooks are off-putting to students and expensive to produce. Authors of books\ntherefore have to choose between alternative presentations of material, and teachers usually\nfind that even the textbook they like best does various things in ways they would not choose.\nThe volume of material being stored in WinEcon is not immediately apparent to the student,\n24\nAu-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nand where it seems likely to be useful, the package will include alternative presentations. One\nof the changes resulting from monopolization which the screen shown in Figure 8 derives, is a\nmeasure of the deadweight loss of monopoly. Figure 9 explains that the deadweight loss can\nalso be measured in a different way, and asks the student to investigate why the measures are\nthe same.\nA student who does not wish to compare the two measures can easily proceed to the next\nscreen by clicking the appropriate screen-movement button. And lecturers who wish their\nstudents to study only selected screens will be able to customize the package for their course\nand exclude specified sections. All the screens in WinEcon will have a unique name so that\nafter customization each screen can still be identified and thus cross-screen references main-\ntained.\nStudents sometimes have difficulty in picking out relevant material from a textbook. With\nlecturer customization, a computer-based learning package can be tailored to a particular\ncourse. In addition, the menu mechanism allows the student to navigate through the package\nto a particular page. Each module has a standard style top-level menu listing the topics\navailable in that module. On clicking a topic button, the user enters that topic and is con-\nfronted with a second-level menu specific to the topic, one of which is shown in Figure 10.\nThis menu allows the student to go straight to a named page within the topic by clicking the\npage name. From any screen within a topic, the student can click a button in the bottom\nwindow bar to return to the second-level menu. From this page, the student can click the\nmodule map button to return to the top-level menu of topics. This system allows students to\nhave total control over where they start within a module. Figure 10 shows the menu of\nchoices for the Welfare Effects of Monopoly topic. Students are encouraged to click the\nRoladex button to reveal them one at a time, as a lecturer would do with a real overhead\nprojector. A Reveal All button is also provided, however, and this gives fast access to parti-\ncular sub-topics when required, for example for revision purposes.\nThe menu system, together with the glossary to be included in the finished version of the\nsoftware is expected to provide students with easily accessible self-help facilities where they\nFigure 9: Using the\nexisting diagrams to\npresent an 'alternative\nview'\n01993.

As tutors are increasingly busy, and computers\nare more widely available, we anticipate students choosing to go to WinEcon with their\ndifficulties. They may even find WinEcon more approachable than their tutor because they\nknow it will not look down on them when they ask for help on points which all the other\nstudents seem to understand.\nDepth of understanding\nOne of the roles of tutorials in conventional teaching is to allow student to discover the extent\nof their knowledge of a topic. Economics tutors may ask their students to draw for themselves\ndiagrams that have been presented to them. WinEcon checks students' understanding of\ndiagrams by asking them to indicate how they should be built up, and by requiring them to\nmove curves to their correct position. If they are wrong, they are invited to try again and if\nnecessary may be given some suggestion on how to proceed. Should they wish to, they can try\nthe analysis again and again. Another possible advantage over a tutor is that the computer's\npatience is inexhaustible.\nBefore encountering the screen shown in Figure 11, a student is expected to have learned\nabout equilibrium in Perfect Competition and Monopoly from screens such as those in Figures\n6 to 9. The screen shown in Figure 11 asks the student to indicate which curves are required to\ndetermine the equilibrium position of a perfectly competitive industry. Necessary curves\nappear in the diagram when the buttons for them are clicked, while other buttons activate pop-\nup error messages containing hints about what to do. Students must next demonstrate that\nthey understand the concept of the industry choosing to operate where marginal cost equals\nmarginal revenue, because the ordinate marked on the graph must be dragged to that point for\nthe analysis to proceed. If it is correctly positioned, the ordinate disappears, the construction\nlines are drawn in and price and output are marked Pc and Qc respectively. Otherwise, the\nordinate returns to its original position and a message appears saying that the position chosen\nwas wrong, and inviting the student to have another attempt. Having correctly positioned the\nordinate, the student then proceeds to determine monopoly equilibrium, and to position the\n26\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\nlong-run average cost curve using the same method. Screens such as this apply the familiar\nWindows drag-and-drop procedure to involve students in creating graphs. This method of\nlearning is particularly attractive as it allows the student to experiment with ideas in the\nabsence of time pressure, and, more importantly, to make mistakes and learn from them\nwithout fear of being derided by their peers. In this way, it is hoped that the student can gain\nfurther understanding of concepts and perhaps more confidence in experimentation with what\nwould otherwise be presented as fact.\nOnce the somewhat complex diagram shown in Figure 12 has been built up, the student steps\nthrough the analysis of profits in both industries by using a multiple click button, the caption\nof which changes each time it is clicked. The formulae used are displayed in the form in\nwhich they would be hand-written by the student.\nFurther development and pilot testing\nAlthough the formula displayed in Figure 12 is for explanatory purposes only, we are design-\ning a mechanism with which the student can answer numerical questions (particularly those\nrequiring algebraic solutions) by selecting terms from a palette. These responses will be\nconverted by WinEcon's program into a true mathematical expression so that they can be\nevaluated algorithmically. Such a system will typically be used in the Mathematics for\nEconomists module (the third module in production at Leicester). The attractive feature of\nthis palette mechanism is that it does not require students to have to learn a new method for\nwriting mathematical expressions (for example, 4 * X * X instead of 4X2) in order to provide\nanswers to these types of questions.\nAnother part of the package, which is still at the development stage, is the test module. This\nwill contain questions on all parts of the package that are suitable for computer marking.\nThese questions will be contained in a database so that lecturers will be able to add. their own\nquestions and\/or customize those which already exist. With numerical questions, we expect to\nprovide different data randomly to different students. We hope that WinEcon will generate\ndiscussion among students, but we do not want them simply to be able to type in answers that\nFigure 11: Revising the\ntheory with drag-and-\ndrop graphics\n\u00a91993.

Hence it welcomes\nAssociate members who provide regular feedback on the package as it is being produced.\nUser-evaluation is also considered important. Some of the material presented in this paper\nwas trialled with a small number of Leicester students in June 1993, and selected tutorial\ngroups are using it to write assignments in January 1994. A large trial involving around 200\nstudents is also in progress at another development site. It is too early to be sure how the\nintended users will react to WinEcon, but the initial responses have been very positive.\nTypically, students feel that when using the computer they are more in control of the informa-\ntion presented to them, and thus feel that there is less pressure involved with the process of\nlearning.\nThe suggestions of Associate members and the information gained from the student trials will\nall have a bearing on the revisions made as the final version of WinEcon is produced. The\nwork of the Consortium is some way near to completion, with WinEcon projected to be\ngenerally available in October 1994. In total, WinEcon will consist of 22 modules covering all\nthe requirements, for introductory economics, including skills-based modules in data handling\nand mathematics.\nConclusion\nThe most likely application of WinEcon is in replacing some tutorial classes. Students will be\nable to cover material dealt with in lectures in their own time using the software. Each\nmodule will explain the key aspects of the theory and allow the student to explore 'what\nhappens if ..?\u2022' situations. The software will then test them on how well they understand the\nmaterial. By using WinEcon, it is hoped that students will feel they will have greater control\nover their learning process. Not only will they be able to explore areas of interest using\nWinEcon, but those students who perhaps feel overwhelmed with the amount and speed of\n28\nALT-J VOLUME 2 NUMBER 1\ninformation which has been presented to them in lectures can use the package to learn the\nbasic principles and concepts at their own pace and in a way which is more readily accessible\nthan it would be with a conventional text book. Finally, it is hoped that the methods of\npresentation which have resulted from the development of WinEcon will be widely applicable\nand useful to developers of computer based learning material in a variety of disciplines.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank an anonymous referee for helpful contributions and sugges-\ntions.\nAssociate members\nTo become an Associate member of the TLTP Economics Consortium, contact:\nPhil Hobbs\nProject Director, Economics Consortium\nCentre for Computing in Economics\nUniversity of Bristol\n8 Woodland Road\nBristol BS8 1TN\nTel: 0272 288478\nemail: phil.hobbs@bristol.ac.uk\nReferences\nAyres, M.
