Much of this literature has refuted the stereotypes of anti-\npsychoanalytic critique \u2013 the idea that psychoanalysis inadequately understands \nthe subject-to-society relation, that it remains antithetical to socio-historical \ncritique, the contention that the notion of the unconscious commits one to an \nessentialist depth-psychology \u2013 successfully demonstrating the applicability of \nLacanian thought to a variety of pressing societal, political and ideological \ndilemmas. \n The fact that Lacanian theorizations of subjectivity are under-utilized and, \nindeed, so often misunderstood, or reduced to crude approximations, is not \nsimply the fault of a uninterested readership. It is true that certain approaches to \nLacanian psychoanalysis do result in something akin to a self-referential \nlanguage game, where the concepts in question remain isolated from other \nrealms of theorization or from non-clinical horizons of application. The aim of this \nspecial issue is to take up the challenge of demonstrating the practical \napplication of Lacanian theory in relation to subjectivity and to do so not from a \nrange of disciplinary perspectives (political studies, historiography, urban and \nspatial theory, critical psychology, performance studies, the concerns of \npedagogy and art theory) but in a way that connects Lacanian and \npsychoanalytic thought to a variety of non-psychoanalytic theories and practices. \n \nThe subject of fantasy\u2026and enjoyment \nThe paper that opens this special issue, Glynos and Stavrakakis\u2019s \u2018Lacan and \npolitical subjectivity\u2019, explores the potential for political theory of the Lacanian \nnotion of fantasy and the associated idea of the \u2018subject of enjoyment\u2019. The \nauthors offer a number of helpful links as a means of introducing their topic. \nThrough an initial consideration of critical psychology research on fantasy in the \nworkplace, the authors explore a Lacanian understanding of fantasy and the \nrelated problematic of jouissance, using these notions to introduce a discussion \nof what we might term the \u2018affective turn\u2019 in contemporary social theory. Perhaps \nthe most helpful aspects of this paper to non-initiates is the clear overview the \nauthors provide of the Lacanian subject. Foremost here is the idea of the subject \nas constitutively split, as ex-centric (as \u2018outside\u2019 unto itself, as one might put it), \nor, more radically yet, as void, as not merely a lacking subject, but as \nsubjectivized lack, as Chiesa (2007) helpfully puts it. Clearly, this is not a positive \nvision of the subject; lack here is a constant and inescapable condition.  \n 1\nThis lack, however, must be understood as more than a morass of \nnegativity, as it is sometimes, unhelpfully, presented in critical literature on \nLacan. Against such a reductive caricature, the Lacanian understanding of the \nsubject is as lacking in such a way that it leads to a sequence of ongoing \nidentificatory acts which aim precisely to deliver a positive (symbolic-imaginary) \nidentity to that which has no positively defined essence. Given this impetus - the \nsubject\u2019s unceasing attempts to cover over its constitutive lack - we can \nappreciate not only the persistence of fantasy - which provides an imaginary \nmeans of attempting to attain such impossible ends - but also, the fact, as Glynos \n& Stavrakakis insist, of the socio-symbolic dependency of subjectivity. In short, \nthe constitutive impossibility of a cohesive, positive, autonomous subjectivity is \nprecisely the underlying condition of possibility for the myriad imaginary and \nsymbolic identifications that characterize the complexity of subjectivity. \nOne of the many strengths of this paper is that it includes a valuable \ndifferentiation \u2013 often lacking in less textured Lacanian accounts \u2013 between the \ndiffering modes of jouissance. The interactions between jouissance and the \ndialectics of socio-political identification for Glynos & Stavrakakis include: 1) the \nimaginary promise of recapturing lost\/impossible enjoyment; 2) limit experiences \nlinked to a jouissance of the body; and 3) enjoyment as it connects to the motor \nof desire (objet petit a), the object of identification that relies on a fantasmatic \nnarrative to explain a given lack of enjoyment. The last of these modalities of \njouissance is an instrumental factor in the operation of fantasy. The logic peculiar \nto fantasy, as Glynos & Stavrakakis explain, involves the staging of a relation \nbetween the subject (as lack) and the object (which always evades symbolic \ncapture) thereby \u201corganizing the affective dimension of the subject, the way it \ndesires and enjoys\u201d. The advantage of this approach to fantasy is that it \u201clinks the \n\u2018dry\u2019 socio-symbolic field\u2026.to the \u2018sticky\u2019 affects of the subject\u201d.  \nA further differentiation between modes of jouissance becomes important \nwhen the authors turn their attention to specifying different forms of subjectivity. \nThe distinction between social and political subjectivity is made possible on the \nbasis that the former is linked to practices conforming to current socio-political \nnorms, whereas the latter contests and disputes them. The distinction between \nthe ideological and ethical subject, on the other hand corresponds to the \ndifference between phallic and non-phallic (or feminine) jouissance. We have in \nmind here the difference between a mode of enjoyment stemming from an \noverinvestment in a socially-configured ideal or norm, and a type of enjoyment \nlinked to an awareness of the contingency of social relations, one that does not \naim to totalize, to complete or to \u2018make whole\u2019.  \n The issue of fantasy is also of central importance in Hook\u2019s paper, which \ntakes up the notion of unconscious transactions between the subject and the \ntrans-subjective social order (the Lacanian \u2018big Other\u2019) as a means of \nunderstanding a series of paradoxes evident within apartheid ideology. A key \nconcern here revolves around the difficulty of separating historical from \nsubjective agency and, moreover, with the apparent impossibility of resolving the \ncontradiction of apartheid ideology as simultaneously both a carefully crafted \nideological doctrine and a parasitic idea-system possessing the minds of its \n 2\nhosts. Hook argues that the two modes of theorizing the subject-Other relation in \nLacan\u2019s Seminar XI - the processes of alienation and separation - provide a \nmeans of understanding how apartheid ideologues could both seemingly stand \noutside ideology (at least inasmuch as they were its authors) and yet remain \nnonetheless themselves subject to the spread of its ideas. \nBy linking fantasy to the posited desire of the Other, by viewing it as the \nreturn-effect of the incessant line of unconscious questioning addressed to the \nOther (\u2018Where do I belong?\u2019, \u2018What is my role here?\u2019, \u2018What is the nature of this \nsociety?\u2019, \u2018What do you, the Other, want of me?\u2019) we are able to view fantasy as \nboth that which lies at the very core of subjectivity and yet also necessarily \nformulated within the parameters of the socio-symbolic order. Fantasy thus, \naccording to Hook, is \u201cboth in a sense autonomous \u2013 it is the invention of the \nsubject, their unconscious response to the enigma of the Other\u2019s desire \u2013 and yet \nit is nevertheless contingent on the Other inasmuch as it is a kind of working \nhypothesis - charged with certain modes and promises of jouissance - to the \nquestion of the Other\u2019s desire\u201d. This then is perhaps the most paradoxical aspect \nof fantasy, that it is both that which, more than anything else, constitutes what is \nirreducible about us despite that it cannot ever be fully separated from the field of \nthe Other. What this means, then, is that while there certainly is an element of \nsymbolic determination at play within the persistence of apartheid ideology \u2013 the \nbig Other of white apartheid South Africa was indeed a racist Other - this \nideology is ultimately held aloft, recreated, reanimated by the fantasies and \nenjoyments of its beneficiaries, for which, to emphasize, such subjects remain \nfully accountable. \n \nPhobic topology and social contradiction \nChiesa\u2019s \u2018Topology of fear\u2019 takes as its starting point a series of intriguing but \nultimately failed attempts at performing \u2018the psychoanalysis of space\u2019. His \nobjective lies with an exposition of Lacan\u2019s theory of phobia inasmuch as it \nproposes phobia as a particular form of symbolization, \u201ca signifying logos that \ncreates space for the phobic object\u201d. Thus, not only does Chiesa open up a \nperspective on a particular mode of spatial subjectivity, he also advances the \nusefulness of a Lacanian understanding of the phobic. We have opted to briefly \nretrace his argument here, in the hope that such an overview will prove beneficial \nto those coming to his paper with little or no prior knowledge of Lacan. \nChiesa begins his discussion of phobia with a consideration of the three \ncrises of the Oedipus complex \u2013 frustration, privation and castration \u2013 with a \nparticular emphasis being placed on the transition between the first and second \nof these crises when the child is confronted with the Desire-of-the-Mother. This is \nan exemplary instance of anxiety: the child\u2019s potentially engulfing realization of \nthe facts both of the mother\u2019s lack and of her desire to which he or she is unable \nto adequately respond.  \n The figure of the father represents an escape route in this respect. \nImaginary competition with the father - presumably along with the child\u2019s \ninevitable failure in attempting to best him - institutes an authority, a paternal \nanchoring-point and, subsequently, a means of ordering the symbolic realm. The \n 3\nchild is thus provided with a way of locating themselves, a means of taking on a \nposition and of grasping the meaning of their social and symbolic co-ordinates. \nThis of course becomes particularly pressing when the child is confronted with \ninstances of \u2018the real\u2019, those irresolvable deadlocks of experience that cannot be \nmediated with any of the tools of language and understanding he has at his \ndisposal; for example, in Freud\u2019s case of little Hans, the dawning realization of \nsexual difference and sexual desire. In the absence of such a figure of \ncompetition and rivalry \u2013 little Hans\u2019s father poses him no threat and his mother\u2019s \ndesire seems all to accessible, too present \u2013 another mediator, another \u2018paternal \noperator\u2019 needs to be sought. This is one way of approaching the phobic object in \nthe little Hans case: a crude signifier \u2013 for Hans, a horse \u2013 that enables a \nsimultaneous re-ordering of the symbolic world and a protection from (or indeed \na localization of) a troubling anxiety. This phobic object is to be understood along \nthe lines of an empty signifier, which is to say that it has no single and fixed \nmeaning, but is generatively applied in a variety of different relationships (in \nsuccessive attempts on Hans\u2019s part, for example, to restructure his world and \nindeed his relationship to his mother, his father, his sister, etc.). \n It is important, as Chiesa emphasizes, that Hans\u2019s \u2018location problems\u2019 \nhave a spatial dimension. Hans\u2019s symbolic co-ordinates have been unmoored in \nan anxiety-provoking way which impinges on his spatial security, a fact which \nsuggests the pertinence of this account for an understanding of phobic spaces \nmore generally. The ingenuity of Lacan\u2019s interpretation of the little Hans case - \nand indeed of the applicability of this theorization to Mike Davis\u2019s account of the \nphobic spaces of Los Angeles - is to be found in a reference to the Levi-\nStraussian notion of the myth. According to the latter, a myth is a narrative that \nbegins with an irresolvable situation, a \u2018real\u2019 impossibility, and that eventually \nyields a further contradiction at a higher level, thus both containing within itself \nand also reaching beyond the original deadlock. As Chiesa relates, Hans has two \nfantasies, one of leaving but always rejoining his mother, another of departing by \ntrain without his father but somehow nonetheless arriving with him. There is \nsomething functional about this succession of fantasies and a type of resolution \nis thus attained. A given deadlock (a return trip to the mother which never fails) is \nrecapitulated at a higher level, in the form of a second fantasy which sublates the \nfirst (he finally succeeds in leaving with the father). What, then, is the relevance \nof this Levi Straussian logic to the myths and phobias to Davis\u2019s account of Los \nAngeles? For Davis, fear is an ideological construction that has been imposed on \nthe urban population; a mediator, an operator, a means of dealing with the \u2018real\u2019 \ndeadlock of radical racial and class inequalities which cannot be either wished \naway or adequately mediated by the existing socio-symbolic frame. Unlike in \nHans\u2019s case, the production of phobic spaces here remains acute, pronounced. \nThere is no resolution at hand. Los Angeles\u2019s more privileged communities \nremain stuck in fear, in a situation where phobia, as Chiesa notes, naturalizes \nsocial contradictions.  \n \n \n \n 4\nIntersubjectivity and the (im)possibility of connection \nThe contributions by Frosh, Neill and Baraitser and Bayly each seek to explore, \nin their own ways, questions of how it is we might, as subjects, come to, or fail to, \nrelate. Frosh is concerned with the fact of language as medium necessarily \nfunctioning as mediator. That is, the very thing which supposedly connects us, in \nso doing, necessarily emphasizes the gap between us. Through a careful reading \nof the opening lines of Genesis, Frosh brings out the overlooked point that prior \nto the word, which is most usually seen as what is there in the beginning, there is \nnot simply nothing or silence but, rather, tehom. Where tehom is usually \nunderstood as the deep, formless water or chaos which precedes creation, Frosh \nbrings out a more nuanced translation, allowing us hear the murmur before the \nfirst word. This is then linked to a sense of what remains always with and yet \nalways outside of language. Human speech is always accompanied, necessarily, \nwith the unsaid; an unsaid which is not simply the nothing of silence but is rather \na persistent murmuring of not yet meaning, the not yet understood. One way of \nconceptualising this something in the human subject which insists beyond \nlanguage and understanding is through Lacan\u2019s concept of das Ding.  \nFor Lacan, das Ding or the Thing refers to that which insists beyond any \nimaginary or symbolic capture or, as Lacan himself puts it, it is \u201cthe thing in its \ndumb reality\u201d (1992). Drawing on \u017di\u017eek\u2019s use of this concept, Frosh raises crucial \nquestions for our understanding of ethics and being human. Against the popular \ntrend in ethical theory, fueled by readings of Levinas and his notion of the \nirreducible otherness of the other, Frosh draws on \u017di\u017eek to show that that which \nlies beyond comprehension, that in the other which is truly other, is not \nnecessarily the human of Levinas but might be better understood as the \ninhuman. One point which emerges here is that where a Levinasian ethics might \nbe understood to stop at the point of a shared elemental - the face of the other \nfor Levinas is typically demanding of a response \u2013 \u017di\u017eek\u2019s use of the concept of \nthe Thing allows us to appreciate a more alien encounter, a more stringent \nalterity and this, in turn, raises crucial questions of how it is we might respond \nethically to the other. \nThese questions are, in indirect ways, picked up in the two articles which \nfollow. Like Frosh, Neill is concerned with questions of relation and, specifically, \nquestions of how we conceptualize the boundary between the self and the social. \nMainstream psychology has typically sidestepped this question by supposing \nitself to have already solved it. Through recourse to Descartes\u2019 cogito, arguably \nthe prototype of modern conceptions of the self, and Husserl\u2019s revisiting of \nDescartes in The Cartesian Meditations, Neill poses the question of how we \nmight come to conceptualise intersubjectivity in a manner which does not \neffectively reduce either the self to the other or the other to the self. Drawing on \nLacan and the Lacanian influenced theorist and artist, Bracha Ettinger, Neill \npresents an understanding of intersubjectivity which contests the traditional \npsychoanalytic concept of mother-child unity in favour of what we might \ntentatively term an originary difference. Like Frosh, Neill utilizes Lacan\u2019s notion of \ndas Ding, but this time seeking to distance it from its \u017di\u017eekian overtones of horror \nand the inhuman and emphasize what might be understood to be one of Lacan\u2019s \n 5\ncentral points; that that in the other which refuses comprehension cannot, \nlogically, be distinguished from that in oneself which refuses comprehension. \nThrough careful analysis of key texts from Freud, Lacan and Ettinger, Neill \nsuggests that our constriction by the dominant concepts in modern philosophy \nand psychology has forced us into a position where it has become all but \nimpossible to think the relation of self and other without being trapped by \nseemingly common-sense notions of individuality and the naturalization of \nseparateness that this suggests. Lacan\u2019s thinking linked with Ettinger\u2019s armoury \nof border-concepts, Neill argues, furnishes us with a fresh vocabulary which then \nbrings with it fresh ways of thinking the subject-other divide. \n \nAnxious encounters \nThis theme of relation is picked up again in Lisa Baraitser and Simon Bayly\u2019s \u2018On \nwaiting for something to happen\u2019 where they focus on two seemingly quite \ndifferent contexts of encounter to question notions of the ethical or what, with \nLevinas, we might term, the response in responsibility. They do this by utilizing \nJane Gallop\u2019s anecdotal theory approach wherein an anecdote is recounted and \nthen worked through to draw out the theoretical insights it might offer. The first \ntwo anecdotes in the paper concern experiences of therapy sessions; one in \nwhich one of the authors, as therapist, begins to faint and slide from her chair \nand, the other, in which the other author, as analysand, reacted to a comment \nfrom their therapist with the sensation of having their \u2018spine plugged in\u2019. The \nsecond group of anecdotes relate secondhand accounts of a performance by the \nItalian performance artist Franko B. whose performances typically involve an \nexposition of vulnerability through nakedness and, until recently, controlled \nbleeding. In the performance in question, 2002\u2019s Aktion 398, Frank B. staged \nintimate one-to-one encounters wherein each \u2018audience\u2019 member shared two \nminutes with him in a closed room. All the anecdotes, therefore, relate to the idea \nof relating in one-to-one situations, situations in which those present might be \nunderstood to be drawn to respond to the other and situations in which those \npresent might be understood to be drawn to a sense of responsibility towards the \nother present there. \nDrawing on a range of theorists, from Lacan to Levinas, from Badiou to \nAgamben, Baraitser and Bayly forge a meaning from their anecdotes which sees \na conjunction between the analytic session and the theatrical performance, which \nforegrounds what they term the \u2018liveness\u2019 in each encounter. This notion of \nliveness, which has its roots Philip Auslander\u2019s thesis on the problematic \ndistinction between live and mediatized performances, is developed here as an \nimportant new concept in thinking the ethics of encounter and helps us \nunderstand something central to analytic experience, the potential for reaching \nout and across to the other. \nEncounter and perhaps even something like Baraitser and Bayly\u2019s \nliveness are key too in the experience of Antony Gormley\u2019s Blind Light, the \nexhibition held at the Hayward Gallery in the summer of 2007. Central to the \nexhibition was the piece Blind Light itself, a 8m by 10m glass box filled with a \ndense cloud-like vapour and lit with fluorescent light. Visitors to the Gallery were \n 6\nallowed, twenty-five at a time, to enter the box and wander in its space, inevitably \nencountering each other as they did, but encountering each other in a manner \nquite different from usual. With the vapour, it was impossible to see your own \nhand nevermind your neighbour. This meant that collision was all but \nunavoidable. The effect was that, in this strange space, you moved precariously, \nbumping repeatedly into strangers who remained conventionally strangers while \nat the same time becoming intimate fellow travelers. \nAs well as being a renowned artist, Antony Gormley is also deeply \ninterested in psychoanalytic ideas. We are very lucky to be able to include in this \nspecial edition a transcription of a discussion between Antony and three key \nfigures in the world of psychoanalytic writing; Darian Leader, Renata Salecl and \nSusie Orbach. The discussion took place shortly after the Blind Light exhibition \nclosed and, thus, takes as its starting point experiences of that and, what we \nmight understand as its companion piece, Event Horizon, the collection of life \nsized figures which were stood on buildings and bridges around the Hayward \nGallery. Not only does the discussion offer important insights into Antony \nGormley\u2019s work, but also, focusing on ideas of anxiety and connection from a \npsychoanalytic, and primarily Lacanian, perspective, it echoes many of the ideas \nand themes discussed in more depth elsewhere in this issue. \nFollowing Glynos and Stavrakakis\u2019s and Hook\u2019s discussions of fantasy \nand its relation to the social, in \u2018Public Space and the Body\u2019 Renata Salecl points \nus towards the precarity of fantasy, suggesting that the experience of Blind Light \ncan function to disorientate not only our spatial awareness but that it can unsettle \nour very experience of reality, a reality which, as we have discovered, is always \nnecessarily supported by fantasy. Salecl links this experience to anxiety and, in \nunderstanding her discussion here, the reader would be well served to return to \nChiesa\u2019s paper where he clarifies the distinction between fear and anxiety, that  \n\u201c[anxiety] is the subject's confrontation with the lack [absence] of object, in which \nhe is swallowed up\"  (Lacan, Seminar IV, 345-6). We can see here, perhaps, a \ndirect evocation of Blind Light and it is in this anxious space that we might find \nechoes of the murmur to which Frosh points, the unspoken which accompanies \nour relating to others and, to link this with Neill\u2019s argument, the murmur we hear \nin ourselves. As Antony Gormley puts it, \u201cWe need art as a space in which we \ncan familiarise ourselves the incommensurable, the unknowable, the unseeable \nboth within ourselves and in space at large and escape from the dominance of \nvisible symbolic orders.\u201d   \n \nNegativity against knowledge \nThe brief article that closes the issue, Parker\u2019s review of the recently translated \nSeminar XVII, \u2018The other side of psychoanalysis\u2019, lists a series of Lacan\u2019s \nwarnings against a series of lures \u2013 those of mastery, individuality and truth - that \nstem from treating psychoanalysis as an idealized form of knowledge. What is \nintriguing about this seminar is the extent to which Lacan takes on and extends a \nseries of critiques that psychoanalysis is often presumed to have ignored, \nincluding the dynamics of institutional-spatial power-relations, the blunt \napplication of psychoanalytic models to history, and the universalizing \n 7\nprescription of the Oedipus complex. More striking yet is the degree to which \nLacan proves willing to use these critiques psychoanalytically \u2013 in line, that is, \nwith the psychoanalytic imperative of destabilizing illusions of understanding, \nmastery and individual agency - against certain trends within psychoanalysis \nitself.  \nParker concludes with a twofold cautioning, which perhaps makes for an \nappropriate ending to this issue as a whole. He is concerned not only with a \nroutine problem underlying the attempt to turn subjectivity into viable forms of \nknowledge, that is, the transformation of critique into \u201csomething\u2026marketable \nand useful\u201d, but also with the possibility that we might neglect \u201cthe negativity of \npsychoanalysis\u201d as precisely a means of challenging and over-turning such \n\u201cidealized forms of knowledge\u201d. \n \nReferences \nChiesa, L.
