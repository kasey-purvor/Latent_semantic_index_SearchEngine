Both direct energy use for crop29\nmanagement and indirect energy use for fertilizers, pesticides and machinery production, have30\ncontributed to the major increases in food production seen since the 1960s. However, the31\nrelationship between energy inputs and yields is not linear. Low energy inputs can lead to lower32\nyields and perversely to higher energy demands per tonne of harvested product. At the other33\nextreme, increasing energy inputs can lead to ever smaller yield gains. Although fossil fuels34\nremain the dominant source of energy for agriculture, the mix of fuels used differs due to the35\ndifferent fertilization and cultivation requirements of individual crops. Nitrogen fertilizer36\nproduction uses large amounts of natural gas and some coal, and can account for more than 50%37\nof total energy use in commercial agriculture. Oil accounts for between 30 and 75% of energy38\ninputs of UK agriculture, depending on the cropping system. Whilst agriculture remains dependent39\non fossil sources of energy, food prices will couple to fossil energy prices and food production40\nwill remain a significant contributor to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Technological41\ndevelopments, changes in crop management, and renewable energy will all play important roles in42\nincreasing the energy efficiency of agriculture and reducing its reliance of fossil resources.43\n44\nKeywords: Energy in agriculture, fossil energy, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, land use,45\nagroforestry, policy46\n47\n48\n1 Energy Use for food production49\nThe IPCC\u2019s 3rd Assessment report (IPCC 2001) estimated that by 1995, agriculture accounted for50\nabout 3% (9EJ) of global energy consumption, but more than 20% of global greenhouse gas51\nemissions. Figure 1 highlights the trend of increasing energy inputs to agriculture since 1971 and52\nshows the high degree of variability both between regions and over time, for example, the collapse53\nin energy inputs in the former Soviet Union after the fall of the iron curtain in 1989.54\n55\n[INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]56\n57\nSubstantial areas of agricultural land also came out of production as these (former USSR) farms58\nbecame exposed to global competition with governments unable to continue subsidising59\nproduction.60\nThe links between, agricultural energy inputs, yields, economic returns, land requirements and61\nland use change needs further research. However, land use change has major implications for62\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and carbon stocks, particularly where forest-land is cleared or63\nwhere previously arable land is allowed to revert to forest. These issues are discussed briefly in64\nthe \u2018indirect emissions\u2019 section below but are not a major focus in this paper.65\nIf energy consumption by agriculture continued to grow at the annual rate outlined by the IPCC66\nfor 1995 (IPCC 2001), total energy inputs into agriculture would have exceeded 10EJ in 2005,67\nequivalent to a share of about 2% of global primary energy consumption. Therefore, agricultural68\ndemand for fossil energy, whilst growing, represents a relatively insignificant and shrinking share69\nof the overall fossil energy supply market. On the other hand, as yields and the inputs needed to70\nsupport those yields increase, agriculture is becoming more dependent on fossil fuels, either71\ndirectly for tillage and crop management or through the application of energy intensive inputs e.g.72\nnitrogen fertilizer and pesticides. Furthermore, the embodied energy in tractors, buildings and73\nother infrastructure necessary to support agriculture and food supplies is likely to continue to grow74\nas developing agricultural producers invest in the infrastructure needed to increase yields and75\nbecome competitive in the global food commodity markets as outlined in Figure 2.76\nEmbodied energy is all the energy used in the creation of a product. In the Life Cycle Assessment77\n(LCA) analyses described subsequently, it is assumed that the long term phosphorous (P) and78\npotassium (K) requirements of all crops must be met.79\n80\n[INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]81\n82\nFossil energy inputs into agriculture have generally been outweighed by yield improvements that83\ndeliver positive energy ratios (energy out: energy (fossil) inputs) \u201ci.e. the energy content of the84\nharvested crop is greater than the fossil energy used to produce the crop,\u201d as highlighted by85\nSamson et al. (2005), in Figure 3. However, over the full lifecycle of a crop, particularly where86\nenergy-intensive drying and processing are required, in some cases more fossil energy can be used87\nthan is contained in the final product. A detailed assessment of the energy inputs and GHG88\nemissions from UK agriculture follows. Whilst much of this assessment is specific to the UK, the89\nheterogeneity in inputs, energy carriers, energy intensities and resulting greenhouse gas emissions90\nfor different crops is considered a conservative representation of commercial agriculture globally.91\n92\n[INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE]93\n94\n1.1 Contemporary UK agriculture95\nThis section covers the main commodities produced in the UK and is from the perspective of96\nLCA, which is a standard method for assessing the \u201ccradle to grave\u201d environmental impacts of a97\nproduct or process. The detailed breakdown that follows comes from the work of Cranfield98\nUniversity and is reported in various outputs (Williams et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2009; Audsley99\net al. 2010). The work was parameterised for England and Wales, although much applies in other100\nparts of the UK. The original study included three field crops (bread wheat, oilseed rape and101\npotatoes), four meats (beef, poultry, pork and lamb), milk and eggs. Tomatoes were included as102\nthe main protected crop. Apples and strawberries were analysed in a later study, together with103\noverseas production of apples, potatoes, tomatoes, strawberries, lamb, beef and poultry meat.104\nPrimary production up to the farm gate was included in all these studies, although in Williams et105\nal. (2009), the end point was the regional distribution centre. This section only covers production106\nto the farm gate.107\nWith LCA, all energy use is traced back to resources in the ground, so that overheads of extraction108\nand distribution are included in reported energy figures. All inputs are considered, so that the109\nembodied energies in fertiliser, machinery, buildings and pesticides are included along with the110\ndirect energy of diesel and other fuels (also known as energy carriers). Estimates for the energy111\ninputs into animal production include inputs for the production of all feed crops e.g. UK feed112\nwheat, UK field beans, American soy and forage (grazed grass and conserved grass or maize) and113\nfor feed processing and distribution. All breeding overheads are also included, so that the final114\nvalues represent the totality of energy used per commodity.115\nOne of the challenges of these analyses is how to allocate burdens when crops are multi-116\nfunctional. Oilseed rape is grown primarily for oil, but a useful meal is also produced as the result117\nof oil extraction, which can be used as an animal feed. It is common practice with products of118\ndisparate properties to allocate burdens by economic value, rather than simply by weight or energy119\ncontent and this approach has been used here.120\n1.1.1 Arable crops121\nEnergy inputs to produce the UK\u2019s main crops (Table 1) range from 1 to 6 GJ\/t. However, each122\nagricultural product has very different properties and uses, making comparisons using a single123\nmetric problematic. Oilseed rape stands out as being the highest energy consumer per tonne of124\nproduct, resulting from relatively low yields and high fertiliser requirements, but the grain is more125\nenergy-rich than cereals or legumes. Bread wheat receives more fertiliser than feed wheat, in126\norder to obtain the high protein concentrations that are required for bread making and so takes127\nmore energy than feed wheat. Although field beans require no nitrogen (N) fertiliser, they have128\nmuch lower yields than wheat and more diesel is used per tonne of beans produced.129\n130\n[INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]131\n132\nCereals tend to follow the same pattern, in terms of energy inputs and wheat is used here as a133\nproxy for cereals in general (Figure 4). UK Wheat also has a similar energy input intensity to US134\nmaize production as shown in Table 1. In non-organic bread wheat production, over half of the135\nenergy used is in fertilisation and about 90% of that energy is in N, typically ammonium nitrate136\nand urea. Bread wheat is unusual in that urea is applied relatively late in the growth season, as a137\nfoliar feed. Direct field energy is just under a quarter of the input. Post harvest energy inputs are138\nmainly for grain drying and cooling, which were calculated here on a long term basis: this clearly139\nvaries yearly according to climatic conditions. Pesticide manufacture accounts for less than 10%140\nof energy input, but a lack of modern data leads to higher degrees of uncertainty about the impacts141\nof pesticide use, with the most recent publically available analysis by Green (1987). In contrast,142\norganic production uses more diesel per unit production, owing to lower yields and the obligation143\nto use the plough, coupled with extra cultivations for weed and pest control.144\nPotato cropping is energy intensive compared to cereals and legumes. For example, the energy145\nused in storage is much larger than other crops: potatoes are kept cool and a proportion is146\nmaintained over the year. This is in contrast to traditional low energy clamping systems, in which147\nlosses were much higher, but the supply season shorter. Early potatoes are generally not stored on148\nfarms, so energy requirements for field operations incur a major fraction of total energy inputs,149\nwhich also include irrigation inputs as well as the high energy costs of planting, cultivating and150\nharvesting. However, because potatoes are high yielding crops, they have low energy input151\nrequirement per tonne harvested. If calculated per tonne of harvested dry matter, because the152\nharvested biomass is 80% water for potatoes, compared to 15 to 20% for wheat grain, for153\nexample, potatoes would have a higher energy intensity factor.154\nSugarcane production under Brazilian conditions and management is also high yielding and has a155\nhigh water content (70% moisture content) when harvested. The relatively low energy inputs156\nneeded for the production of this semi-perennial crop and lower moisture content compared to157\npotatoes, means that when accounting for energy intensity on a dry weight basis, sugarcane would158\nhave a lower energy intensity than UK wheat. Even when processed to ethanol and\/or crystalline159\nsugar, because of the use of residual biomass arising from sugar extraction, to provide power and160\nheat, fossil energy inputs are minimised.161\n162\n[INSERT FIGURE 4 HERE]163\n164\nThe types of energy used vary between crops and production systems (Figure 5), and also165\nlocation. In the UK, as with most of Europe, N fertiliser production uses mainly natural gas.166\nHowever, according to He (2009) in China, coal currently provides about 80% of the energy167\ninputs into nitrogen fertiliser production rising from 71% in 2004. Diesel comes from crude oil.168\nElectricity used either directly (e.g. cooling grain) or indirectly in machinery manufacture, also169\nuses coal, nuclear and some renewables. The dominant energy carrier in non-organic wheat170\nproduction is thus natural gas, but it is crude oil in organic wheat production and in China it would171\nbe coal. The embodied energy in machinery is an overhead of about 40% of the energy used in172\ndiesel, reflecting the high wear environment of cultivating and harvesting, as well as continually173\nhigh power demand on engines, compared with road transport.174\n175\n[INSERT FIGURE 5 HERE]176\n177\nAlthough fertiliser manufacture is energy-intensive, reducing fertiliser use has mixed effects.178\nEnergy input per ha is reduced, but so is yield, thus increasing the relative input of cultivation179\nenergy per t. Reducing yield also implies a need to displace production elsewhere in order to180\nmaintain supply. This could be in areas that are less suitable and \/ or lead to land use change, e.g.181\nconversion of grassland to arable, with the consequent loss of soil carbon (C). It does appear,182\nhowever, that some reduction in N supply can reduce energy use per t bread wheat (Figure 6).183\nHowever, a very large reduction in N application can cause sufficient yield loss that cultivation184\nbecomes the dominant energy demand and energy use per tonne increases again.185\n186\n[INSERT FIGURE 6 HERE]187\n188\n1.1.2 Animal production189\nThe energies used per tonne of the main outputs of animal production are all substantially higher190\nthan crops (Table 2). This results from the concentration effect as animals are fed on crops and191\nconcentrate these into high quality protein and other nutrients. Feed is the dominant term in192\nenergy use (average of about 75%), whether as concentrates, conserved forage or grazed grass.193\nDirect energy use includes managing extensive stock, space heating for young birds and piglets194\nand ventilation for pigs and poultry. Housing makes up a relatively small fraction of total energy195\ninputs, and is even lower for more extensive systems, like free-range hens. For egg production,196\nthe energy demand of manure management is more than offset by the value of chicken manure as197\na fertilizer, hence the negative value.198\n199\n[INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]200\n201\nThe energy carriers used in animal production vary less than crops (Table 3). About one third is202\nfrom crude oil and another third from natural gas. However, because animal feed production and203\nsupply requires 70 to 90% of the total energy inputs for livestock production, animal husbandry204\nmay be more vulnerable to high and volatile energy costs compared to the direct supply of arable205\ncrops. This could lead to increased pressure on extensive grazing, reversing the trends over the206\nrecent decades of decreasing land area requirements per kg livestock production.207\n208\n[INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]209\n210\n2 Current Greenhouse Gas Emissions211\nAgriculture occupies more than 50% of the world\u2019s vegetated land (Foley et al. 2005) and212\naccounts for between 10 to 20% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions, depending on where the213\nboundaries are drawn between agriculture and the other sectors (IPCC 2006; International214\nFertilizer Industry Association 2009). However, its contribution to methane and nitrous oxide215\nproduction is disproportionately large. On a global scale, agricultural processes are estimated to216\naccount for 50% of anthropogenic methane production and 80% of anthropogenic nitrous oxide217\nproduction (Crutzen et al. 2008; Olesen et al. 2006). As in industry, at all production stages fossil218\nfuel combustion for heat and energy represents a direct and major source of agricultural219\ngreenhouse gas emissions. In addition, anaerobic fermentation and microbial processes in soil and220\nmanure lead to releases of methane and nitrous oxide in both livestock and arable systems.221\nNitrogen fertiliser production alone consumes about 5% of the global natural gas supplies and222\nsignificant amounts of nitrous oxide are emitted during the production of nitrate (Jenssen and223\nKongshaug 2003; Kindred et al. 2008; International Fertilizer Industry Association 2009).224\nFurthermore, emissions as a result of land use change (mainly as carbon dioxide) can form a225\nsignificant part of the agricultural impact on the atmosphere.226\n2.1 Arable Sources227\nThe period between 1965 and 2000 saw a doubling of global agricultural production (Tilman228\n1999). The total area under cultivation has remained relatively static and this huge increase in229\noutput is primarily the result of massive increases in fertilisation and irrigation (Figure 2), as well230\nas improved crop genetics. Global nitrogen fertiliser applications have increased more than six-231\nfold over the past 40 years (Tilman 1999), although there has been considerable regional variation.232\nThe production of mineral and synthetic fertilisers, especially nitrogen using the Haber\u2013Bosch233\nProcess, uses large amounts of fossil energy, mainly natural gas, releasing around 465 Tg carbon234\ndioxide into the atmosphere each year (International Fertilizer Industry Association 2009). It has235\nbeen estimated that 30% of the total fossil energy used in maize production is accounted for by236\nnitrogen fertiliser production (Tilman 1999) and that fertiliser production is responsible for up to237\n1.2% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Wood and Cowie 2004).238\nFertiliser application can also lead to further emissions. Nitrification and de-nitrification of239\nmineral and organic nitrogen fertilisers leads to the release of large amounts of nitrous oxide from240\nsoils (Snyder et al. 2009). The IPCC (2006) Tier 1 estimate is that 1% of all applied nitrogen is241\nemitted in the form of nitrous oxide, although there is considerable uncertainty over this figure.242\nLoss of nitrous oxide from arable soils accounts for around 1.5% of total anthropogenic243\ngreenhouse gas emissions (International Fertilizer Industry Association 2009). Modern techniques244\nthat reduce soil compaction, such as GPS-guided controlled traffic farming, can reduce nitrous245\noxide emissions by between 20 and 50% (Vermeulen and Mosquera 2009).246\nEmissions vary according to cultivation technique and crop type. Anaerobic turnover in rice247\npaddies is a major source of methane (Olesen et al. 2006), although the anoxic conditions when248\npaddies are flooded, minimise carbon dioxide release. Ploughing soils encourages microbial249\ndigestion of soil organic matter, leading to greater net carbon dioxide emissions. Energy use at all250\nstages of arable production represents another significant source of carbon dioxide. However,251\ndifferences in farming techniques, levels of mechanisation, scales of production, and soil and252\nweather conditions in different regions make it difficult to quantify total fossil energy use and to253\nextrapolate data from one agricultural system to another.254\n2.2 Livestock Sources255\nMeat, egg and milk production are estimated to account for half of all the greenhouse gas256\nemissions associated with food production and represent about 18% of global anthropogenic257\nemissions (Garnett 2009). In the UK, livestock farming generates 57.5 Tg carbon dioxide258\nequivalent, which is around 8% of total UK emissions (Garnett 2009). Global demand for meat259\nand dairy products is predicted to increase over the next 50 years due to human population growth260\nand increased wealth. An important source of greenhouse gases in livestock farming is enteric261\nfermentation in ruminants, such as sheep and cattle, which produces significant quantities of262\nmethane (Olesen et al. 2006).263\nGrowth of crops to feed livestock is another major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Around264\n37% of global cereal production and 34% of arable land is used to provide animal feed (FAO265\n2006) and so meat, egg and milk production also contributes to the release of nitrous oxide and266\nother gases as described above. A further consideration is the efficiency with which animal feed is267\nconverted to meat. A large proportion of animal feed is respired or accumulates in non-edible parts268\nof the animal. In the case of cattle, up to 10kg of cereal may be required per kg of meat produced269\nand so cattle farming can represent a significant demand for land and resources (Garnett 2009).270\nSubstantial differences exist between the different forms of livestock production in terms of net271\nenergy and protein feed requirements per kg meat produced. Increasing and volatile fossil fuel272\nprices, unless mitigated, could drive both reductions in meat demand due to increased prices, but273\nalso switching to lower energy intensity, higher efficiency, forms of meat production, possibly274\nfavouring mono-gastric rather than ruminant supply chains.275\n2.3 Indirect Emissions276\nOn a global scale, 75% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the result of fossil fuel277\ncombustion. The remaining 25% are primarily the result of land use change (Snyder et al. 2009;278\nLe Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. 2009). However, land also continues to be a net sink for carbon, absorbing about 29%279\nof total emissions, with the oceans taking up a further 26%. The balance, about 45%, accrues to280\nthe atmosphere (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9. 2009).281\nDeforestation involves the removal of large aboveground biomass stocks, which represented an282\nimportant carbon sink during the 20th century (Bondeau et al. 2007). Belowground biomass is lost283\nas woody root systems are replaced by the smaller, finer roots of grasses and crop plants.284\nDisturbance during cultivation breaks down soil organic matter and accelerates decomposition,285\nleading to further losses of soil carbon and, consequently, carbon dioxide emissions (IPCC 2006).286\nThe soil organic carbon content of temperate arable, grassland, and woodland soils are of the order287\nof 80, 100, and 130 t C ha\u22121 respectively (Bradley et al. 2005). It is thought that between 50 and288\n100 years are required for soil carbon content to reach a new equilibrium following land use289\nchange (Falloon et al. 2004; King et al. 2005) and so this form of disturbance leads to a long-term290\nsource of carbon dioxide. It is generally assumed that there is little difference in soil carbon291\nbetween annual and perennial food crops, including fruit orchards and plantation crops (IPCC292\n2006). However, detailed information is lacking and further research is needed to determine the293\nreal effects of perennial crops on emissions from soils.294\nDeforestation in the Brazilian Amazon basin to provide land for cattle ranching and soybean295\ncultivation for animal feed accounts for a loss of 19,400 km2 of rainforest each year. This alone296\naccounts for 2% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst complex interlinkages297\nand causality chains exist as drivers for deforestation, much of the soybean grown in Brazil is298\nexported for use as animal feed in Europe, Asia, the USA and Russia. Soybean expansion is more299\nclosely associated with Amazonian deforestation than the expansion of other crops (Volpi 2010).300\nOverall, 7% of anthropogenic emissions, totalling 2.4Pg of carbon dioxide per year, are estimated301\nto be the result of livestock-induced land use change (Garnett 2009). Consequently, livestock302\nfarming is a major cause of land use change. Use of former forest land for cattle ranching303\nrepresents a direct land use change; use of the land to grow feed for livestock overseas represents a304\nmajor indirect land use change. Each process results in further greenhouse gas emissions.305\n306\n3 Has agricultural productivity been affected by changes in307\nenergy prices?308\nFossil energy prices directly affect the costs of tillage and fertilisers and indirectly affect almost all309\naspects of agricultural production, through to the prices of food seen by the end consumer. The310\nprevious sections of this paper have outlined the different energy inputs and greenhouse gas311\nemissions (energy and non-energy related) of a range of agricultural production pathways for the312\nmajor food commodities. The results strongly suggest that the production costs of some313\nagricultural commodities will be more sensitive to changing fossil fuel prices than others and that314\nthe options for mitigating the risks of fossil energy prices will also differ between those chains.315\nThis section assesses the trends in the price of oil, natural gas and coal over the last four decades316\nand uses differences between projections for future oil prices to 2030 as a proxy for overall fossil317\nfuel price volatility in this period.318\n3.1 Historic changes in fossil energy prices319\nHistoric trends in the spot prices of oil, natural gas and coal show that throughout the 1980s and320\nmost of the 1990s, spot prices remained below US$4 per GJ, with coal staying below US$ 2\/GJ321\nuntil the turn of the millennium (Figure 7). In fact, until 1995 fossil fuel prices were converging322\naround US$2\/GJ, making electricity production in particular, more attractive from natural gas than323\nfrom coal because of the greater flexibility, decreased capital costs and modularity of natural-gas-324\nfired power stations. Since 1995, prices have increased, first for oil, then for gas and finally325\nfollowed by coal. By 2007, prices for oil and natural gas had more than quadrupled whilst for coal326\nthey had nearly trebled. Since then, as a result of recession and also from increased investment in327\nnew supply and refining capacity, prices have fallen sharply but more recently, since the328\nbeginning of 2009, have started increasing again, particularly for oil, although not yet to the levels329\nseen in 2007 (US EIA 2009; BP 2009; IEA 2009).330\n331\n[INSERT FIGURE 7 HERE]332\n333\nIn part, increasing supplies are a result of the deployment of new technologies, allowing hitherto334\ninaccessible fossil fuel resources such as oil shale, tar sands or \u2018tight\u2019 gas reserves to be exploited.335\nIt is also a result of conventional supplies becoming constrained and the resulting increase in336\nprices making previously too expensive reserves possible to access profitably. As shown in337\nFigure 5, all agricultural commodities in the UK simultaneously use all forms of fossil-derived338\nenergy and some renewables too. A major question remains, as to whether increasing overall339\nprices and increasing volatility in those prices will drive further diversity in energy supply340\nresources, or reductions in overall energy intensity or even in the total supply of agricultural341\nproducts.342\n3.2 Projected fossil energy prices343\nAs a result of real and perceived constraints to conventional fossil fuel supplies, in particular oil344\nand natural gas, robust predictions for prices more than a few years forward are not available and345\nthe uncertainties associated with projections to 2030 are so great that the US Energy Information346\nAdministration currently uses three scenarios for oil price projections that range from US$50 to347\nUS$200 per barrel (Figure 8).348\n349\n[INSERT FIGURE 8 HERE]350\n351\nFor natural gas, the dominant energy feedstock for nitrogen fertiliser production, the recent352\ndevelopment of new drilling techniques has released very substantial quantities of so-called \u2018tight\u2019353\nor \u2018shale\u2019 gas, reducing the price of natural gas in the US from around US$13 per MBTU in 2008354\nto less than US$5 per MBTU in early 2010 (The Economist, 2010) or from US$12.7 to US$ 4.3355\nper GJ. If tight gas is found elsewhere in substantial volumes, as seems possible, then the historic356\nlink between oil and gas prices will be broken, with oil prices likely to increase significantly and357\ngas remaining competitive with coal.358\nIf bioenergy, particularly biodiesel and biogas, becomes cheaper than the direct fossil fuel inputs359\ninto agriculture, primarily diesel, then a rapid switch to on-farm bioenergy is likely to occur where360\nrotary power, transport and thermal processing are required. Whilst the complexity of the361\ninteractions between conventional agricultural feedstocks for food and their use for energy, when362\ncoupled to global oil markets makes this price threshold difficult to estimate, it is likely to be363\naround US$ 70 to 100 per barrel oil equivalent but may be lower for large scale commercial364\nproduction facilities.365\nWhether this switch to bioenergy production is competitive or synergistic with food production366\nwill mainly depend on: the strength of the linkage between energy and food prices, the rate of367\nincrease of demand for bioenergy feedstocks as commodity crops, the impact from increased368\ninvestment from bioenergy and the resultant increase in yields of both conventional crops (food369\nand fuel) and advanced lignocellulosic crops, and, the availability of new land or recovered370\ndegraded or abandoned land.371\n372\n4 Policies to reduce GHG emissions from the food sector373\nThe impact of climate change on agricultural production is still uncertain. However, reports of the374\npotential outcomes for agriculture are well documented (AEA 2007). Farmers in general face the375\nlooming spectre of climate change at two levels; firstly, by having to adapt existing practices to376\ncope with the outcomes of climate change (i.e. changing weather patterns; water availability;377\nchanging patterns of pests, disease and thermal stress in livestock) and secondly, by addressing378\nthose farming activities which are contributing factors to increased GHG emissions.379\nWhilst it is likely that farmers will readily adopt measures which will benefit their productivity380\nand financial outcomes, adopting practices at cost to farming businesses is more likely to require381\npolicy intervention. Developing mechanisms to improve GHG abatement in the agricultural sector is382\ncomplex, not least because policy mechanisms are often devised through different departmental383\npolicy-making regimes.384\nWithin the EU Climate and Energy Package (2008), the agricultural industry is not part of one of385\nthe main components, the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS 2009). Agriculture, as a386\nnon-EU ETS sector is charged with reducing emissions to 10% below 2005 levels by 2020, and it387\nis anticipated that this will be through binding national targets. In the policy context, the farming388\nindustry faces many challenges before carbon trading as an economic strategy becomes a reality.389\nThe UK Government published its low carbon transition plan in 2009390\n(http:\/\/www.theccc.org.uk\/carbon-budgets). The Plan\u2019s main points for agriculture are:391\n\uf0b7 Encourage English farmers to take action themselves to reduce emissions to at least 6%392\nlower than currently predicted by 2020, through more efficient use of fertiliser, and better393\nmanagement of livestock and manure.394\n\uf0b7 Review voluntary progress in 2012, to decide whether further Government intervention is395\nnecessary. The Government will publish options for such intervention in Spring 2010.396\n\uf0b7 Ensure comprehensive advice programmes are available to support farmers in achieving397\nthis aim, to reduce their emissions from energy use, and to save money in the process.398\n\uf0b7 Research better ways of measuring, reporting and verifying agricultural emissions.399\n\uf0b7 Encourage private funding for woodland creation to increase forest carbon uptake.400\n\uf0b7 Provide support for anaerobic digestion, a technology that turns waste and manure into401\nrenewable energy via biogas.402\n\uf0b7 Reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, and better capture of landfill emissions.403\nSome policy instruments which aim to deliver greenhouse gas mitigation within the sector have404\nbeen identified in a report commissioned by the UK\u2019s Department for Food and Rural Affairs405\n(ADAS 2009). The report shows the mitigation potential by 2022 (Table 4), making comparisons406\nto an earlier Scottish Agricultural College report (SAC 2008). The study does not include407\nmitigation potential from biomass production, soil carbon sequestration or options for anaerobic408\ndigestion of farmyard waste and does not expand on further economic or market-based policy409\nmechanisms (e.g. carbon trading extending to farming activities). The policy instruments410\nidentified are as follows:411\n412\n\uf0b7 Regulatory - Cross Compliance and Nitrate Pollution Prevention Regulations (Nitrogen413\nVulnerable Zone (NVZ) regulations)414\n\uf0b7 Economic (voluntary participation) - Environmental Stewardship415\n\uf0b7 Voluntary - Extend Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF), Farm Assurance Public416\nProcurement, Voluntary Agreements and Targeted Communications.417\n418\n[INSERT TABLE 4 HERE]419\n420\n4.1 Indirect policy implications for agricultural emissions421\nPolicies to reduce emissions from the fossil energy sector may impact on agriculture in two422\ndifferent ways. Firstly, by promoting crops which can be used as feedstocks for biofuel or423\nbioenergy; different growing regimes and more efficient energy inputs may be adopted. Secondly,424\ngreenhouse gas emission reporting requirements which are being developed for biofuels may425\naffect farming practices, particularly if benefits for improved emissions are transferred down the426\nsupply chain to the feedstock producers. Policies in the UK which aim to impact fossil fuel energy427\nuse and which may in-turn impact on agriculture are the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation428\n(RTFO), (DfT 2007) and the Renewables Obligation (RO), (DTI, 2006).429\nIn the EU, the Climate and Energy Package (2008) committed the 27 member states to reduce430\nCO2 emissions by 20%, and to target a 20% share of energy supply from renewable energy, by431\n2020 i.e. the so-called \u201c20-20 in 2020\u201d. Policy instruments in the Package, which may then432\nindirectly impact on agriculture, are the Fuels Quality Directive (EU FQD 2009) and the433\nRenewable Energy Directive (EU RED 2009). The FQD aims to reduce harmful atmospheric434\nemissions, including greenhouse gases and includes mandatory monitoring of life cycle435\ngreenhouse gas emissions. The RED, aims to promote renewable energies biofuels and has a436\ncomponent which addresses sustainability of biofuels and the land used to grow biofuel437\nfeedstocks.438\nIn the United States, the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board439\n(CARB) has been at the forefront of developing policy to reduce emissions from fossil energy and440\nhas developed the Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS 2007). This standard is under review by a441\nnumber of individual states in the US, which are also looking to adopt an emissions approach to442\nthe inclusion of biofuels in transport fuels. Nationwide in the U.S., the Environmental Protection443\nAgency (EPA) has developed, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, a444\nRenewable Fuel Standard Program (RFS2, 2009) which aims to increase the volume of renewable445\nfuel in gasoline from 9 billion gallons (34 billion litres) in 2008 to 36 billion gallons (144 billion446\nlitres) by 2022.447\nIn many ways, these policies are leading the development of methodologies which will improve448\nenergy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions across supply chains. Improving emissions and449\nensuring the sustainability of biofuels has led to the development of variety of policy-specific450\nmethodologies. They have also encouraged the formation of global stakeholder interactions,451\nwhich address environmental, economic and social issues e.g. Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuel452\n(RSB); Global Bioenergy Partnership (GBEP) and crop specific initiatives e. g. Roundtable on453\nSustainable Palm Oil (RSPO); Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) and the Better Sugar454\nCane Initiative (BSI).455\nThe UK\u2019s RTFO has been devised with GHG emissions monitoring and reduction as a key456\ncomponent and it has been necessary to stipulate methodology and processes to report GHG457\nemissions from the individual biofuel supply chains used by obligated parties in law (RFA, 2009).458\nThe RTFO\u2019s Carbon and Sustainability methodologies cover biofuel supply chains from feedstock459\nsource, by country and by on-farm production inputs and outputs. In a biofuel supply chain, this460\nmay encourage farmers to improve management practices, providing that a share of the value or461\nbenefits feedback to farmers. Currently, Carbon and Sustainability reporting is not mandatory462\nunder the RTFO and better practices leading to improved carbon and sustainability profiles, are463\nnot rewarded. Many farmers in the UK have been encouraged by the idea of reducing on-farm464\ndiesel costs by producing their own biodiesel from oilseed rape. However, the market value of465\nvegetable oil and costs for processing oils into biodiesel will always be calculated against fossil466\ndiesel costs for farm use (Lewis, 2009). Furthermore, farm vehicles will generally be under467\nwarranty from the vehicle manufacturer and it is unlikely that farmers would risk using out-of-468\nspec fuel, to the detriment of these costly machines.469\nAs noted by Monbiot (2009), addressing energy needs using on-site, renewable energy options470\nonly reduces dependence on diesel for on-farm use by a quarter. Options for farmers to use471\nrenewable energies, such as biomass or biogas for electricity and heat production are often limited472\nto on-farm use only, as there are not the facilities or incentives to connect to the electrical grid.473\nAllowing access to the national grid would give farmers an option to trade renewable energy under474\nthe Renewables Obligation, whereby the mandatory renewable requirement of 15% electricity by475\n2015, could potentially be met in part by surplus on-farm energy generation, traded as Renewable476\nEnergy Certificates (ROCs). The UK government is also reviewing opportunities for a Renewable477\nHeat Incentive (RHI), under the Energy Act (DECC 2008), which promotes investment for478\nbiomass boilers and combined heat and power (CHP) facilities.479\n480\n5 Options for agriculture to reduce its dependence on energy481\n5.1 Change tillage \/ pre-processing482\nLand preparation has become increasingly mechanised over the years. However, mechanical483\ntillage systems are energy intensive and expose soil organic matter (SOM) to decomposition,484\nleading to enhanced greenhouse gas emissions, reduced SOM concentration in soil and potentially,485\nin short and longer term, to soil erosion and degradation. The potential for reducing the energy486\nintensity of agricultural production by adopting alternative tillage systems may occur from487\ndecreased fuel use in mechanical operations or as the result of better long-term soil productivity.488\nAlternative methods of land preparation and crop establishment have been devised to reduce489\nenergy requirements and maintain good soil structure. These include, minimum tillage (min-till),490\nconservation tillage (no tillage or min-till) and direct drilling, resulting in increased surface491\norganic matter, from previous crops residues (soil coverage of 30%) (Van Den Bosche et al.492\n2009). Robertson et al. (2000), compared management techniques in a three crop rotation, over493\neight years in Michigan. The net changes in soil C (g m-2 year-1) were for conventional tillage494\n(plough-based tillage), 0; organic with legume cover, 8.0; low input with legume, 11 and no till,495\n30.496\nThe consequences of reduced tillage on soil carbon are not straight-forward. Baker et al. (2007),497\nconcluded that the widespread view that reduced tillage favours carbon sequestration may be an498\nartefact of sampling methodology, with reduced tillage resulting in a concentration of soil organic499\nmatter in the upper soil layer rather than a net increase throughout the soil. They did however,500\nhighlight that there were several good reasons for implementing reduced tillage practices. In501\ncontrast to Baker et al. (2007), Dawson and Smith (2007) reviewed the subject area and suggested502\nsequestration rates of 0.2 (0\u20130.2) and 0.39 (0\u20130.4) t C ha y-1 for reduced tillage and no-till farming503\nrespectively.504\nEnergy balance calculations resulting from fertiliser application are more difficult to assess, as505\ninteractions with increased soil organic matter become more complex. Studies which focus on506\nenergy inputs, attributed to soil preparation, tend to be regional and crop specific. Energy from507\ntillage will depend on crop requirements, soil type, cultivation\/climatic conditions, equipment508\nused and engine efficiency.509\nA study which compares conventional and integrated farming in the UK attributed energy savings510\nin integrated farming almost entirely to the reduction in energy required for mechanical operations511\n(Bailey et al. 2003). The study also considered the effects on energy of multi-functional crop512\nrotation; integrated nutrient and crop protection methods and ecological infrastructure513\nmanagement (i.e. field\/farm boundary maintenance to promote biodiversity and reduce pollution),514\nin integrated systems. A study for wheat grown in Iran provides a more detailed evaluation of five515\nspecific tillage regimes (Tabatabaeefar et al. 2009). The study reports the min-till system (\u2018T5\u2019 in516\nFigure 9) as most energy efficient, with energy for tillage accounting for 19% of the total energy517\nvs. 32.5% for the least energy efficient (\u2018T1\u2019). Yield outcomes are also reported whereby the min-518\ntill system gives the second highest yield of the five systems, but in overall performance T3 is519\nreported as being the most efficient system when taking both energy input and yield into account.520\n521\n[INSERT FIGURE 9 HERE]522\n523\nSoil carbon as a component of SOM, is important in carbon turnover within the carbon cycle, and524\nin maintaining soil fertility, water and nutrient holding capacity, ecosystems functions and525\npreventing soil degradation. Soil carbon and SOM are important in preserving soil in a productive,526\nquality state for long term crop production (Dawson and Smith 2007). Understanding the527\nprocesses of carbon interaction in soils is complex, both at local and national levels. Carbon528\nlosses from the soil organic matter pool, the effect of carbon loss on nutrient availability and crop529\nproductivity, and the subsequent outcomes for agricultural management activities are all important530\nvariables in calculating the overall carbon stocks and productivity of soils (Dawson and Smith531\n2007). Other farming options, such as residue mulching and the use of cover crops, aim to532\nconserve and enhance SOM or soil carbon sequestration (Lal 2007).533\nThe subsequent effects of nutrient availability on crop productivity vary between cropping534\nsystems (e.g. conventional or organic systems), land types, climatic conditions and time, and535\nrequire further research before being fully integrated into farming systems (Kong et al. 2009).536\nStudies carried out on sites in Belgium have been used to demonstrate nitrogen interactions under537\nvarious planting regimes and to demonstrate the action of tillage on organic matter degradation538\nand the subsequent availability of nitrogen in the nutrient pool over time (Van den Bossche et539\nal.2009). They report higher soil organic matter, microbial biomass and enzymatic activity for540\nconservation tillage, which increases with time. The anticipated effect is slower mineralisation or541\nimmobilisation of nitrogen, leading to enhanced soil fertility as the result of long term build up of542\nnutrient reserves of the soil.543\nUnderstanding the interaction between soil carbon and nitrogen also adds further complexity to544\ndetermining the benefits of increasing soil carbon through changes in tillage systems. Whilst545\nincreasing fertiliser inputs may increase the soil carbon pool, the poorer GHG balance from the546\nincreased use of N fertilisers may negate the sequestration benefit. The reasons for changing547\nagricultural activities should be clear from the outset. Is the anticipated benefit to reduce energy548\ninputs, reduce GHG emissions, improve soil carbon sequestration or to maintain the long-term549\nproductivity of soils? Land management choices may then follow, with trade-offs expected and550\naccepted. For example, planting marginal lands with biomass crops to improve carbon551\nsequestration versus maximising yields on productive lands by increasing fertiliser use, or552\nadopting min-till systems on land areas where mechanical activities are also degrading soil quality553\nor causing soil erosion, such as on sloping sites.554\n555\n5.2 Energy inputs and impacts of fertiliser use in agriculture556\nIn addition to the direct energy inputs for tillage and harvesting, fertilisers can constitute a557\nsignificant share of total energy inputs to agriculture (Figure 4) and food production, particularly558\nfor nitrogen intensive crops such as cereals. Figure 10 shows the different energy requirements559\nfor the main constituents of commercial fertilisers, using European average technologies. The560\nmain nitrogen components of fertilisers, ammonia (NH4; 32 GJ\/t), urea (22 GJ\/t) and liquid UAN561\n(urea ammonium nitrate; 22 GJ\/t), are the most energy intensive to produce, whilst the P and K562\ncomponents all require less than 5 GJ\/t to produce.563\n564\n[INSERT FIGURE 10 HERE]565\n566\nThe energy inputs needed to produce and supply fertilisers and pesticides substantially outweigh567\nthe energy required to apply the products in the field. GHG emission factors for production,568\nsupply and use of N, P and K fertilisers, under average UK conditions, are provided in Table 5.569\nHowever, for N fertilisers, the GHG emissions arise both as a result of the fossil energy inputs570\nneeded to capture and process atmospheric nitrogen, and also from complex soil-based processes571\nthat result in the production and release to the atmosphere of nitrous oxide (N2O) in-field.572\n573\n[INSERT TABLE 5 HERE]574\n575\n5.2.1 Nitrogen fertilisers576\nThe energy inputs into nitrogen fertiliser production have decreased significantly since the577\nbeginning of the last century as a result of continual technological innovation (Figure 11). GHGs578\nemitted during its production include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide as shown in579\nTable 6. Carbon dioxide emissions account for 98% of the GHG emissions on a mass basis, but580\nonly 33% on a global warming potential (CO2 equivalent) basis. N2O accounts for 0.6% of the581\nmass of the GHG released but 65% on a CO2 equivalent global warming potential basis.582\n583\n[INSERT TABLE 6 HERE]584\n585\nHowever, whilst ammonia production is the most energy-intensive part of the production of N586\nfertilisers, nitric acid production causes the release of N2O during its production. Nitric acid is587\nneeded to produce ammonium nitrate (AN) through a reaction with ammonia. The N2O leaks to588\nthe atmosphere in the nitric acid plants and between 70 and 90% of this N2O can be captured and589\ncatalytically destroyed. European plants are now being fitted with this nitrous oxide abatement590\ntechnology and as a result overall AN GHG emissions could be reduced, by 40% overall, from591\n6.93 to 4.16 kg CO2 eq\/kg N.592\n593\n[INSERT FIGURE 11 HERE]594\n595\n5.3 Farm forestry systems (agro-forestry)596\nThe production of woody biomass on land unsuitable for intensive arable farming or extensive597\ngrazing is widely seen as a low-energy input option, for the production of such biomass for598\nmaterial or energy usage. Numerous opportunities exist to integrate the production of woody599\nbiomass and agricultural crops or livestock and production and such \u2018farm-forestry\u2019 or \u2018agro-600\nforestry\u2019 systems have been widely discussed in the literature and through the work of the601\nConsultative Group on International Agricultural Research\u2019s (CIGIAR) World Agroforestry602\nCentre1, much of which is focussed on the developing world. A recent geospatial study by Zomer603\net al. (2009) has shown agro-forestry to be a significant feature of agriculture in all regions of the604\nworld \u2013 see Figure 12.605\n606\n[INSERT FIGURE 12 HERE]607\n608\nZomer et al. (2009) provide a cautious estimate that 17% (~ 3.8 Million km2) of global agricultural609\nland involves agroforestry at >30% tree cover and, potentially, this can be as high as 46% or just610\nover 10 million km2, at >10% or more tree coverage rates. Agro-forestry systems are found in611\ndeveloped as well as less developed regions.612\nThe widespread and significant proportion of agricultural land under agro-forestry management613\n(e.g. in Central and South America) already points to a successful form of integrated land614\nmanagement for both crop production and woody biomass for energy production. This indicates a615\ncapacity for agricultural land management to accommodate integrated energy production;616\n1 see http:\/\/www.worldagroforestry.org\/af\/\ncurrently, in most cases, the woody biomass is used for immediate local needs such as fuelwood617\nfor cooking. However, there is also considerable scope for more widespread introduction of tree or618\ncoppice material to agricultural land specifically to meet on-farm energy needs and, subject to619\ntransportation constraints, as an economic product for off-farm sale. For example, in the UK, a620\nnumber of estates are currently using wood produced on the estate for biomass heat schemes621\nwhich is encouraged under the UK\u2019s Bioenergy Capital Grant Scheme.622\nWith combinations of increasing prices for conventional energy inputs to farming and incentives623\nfor low-carbon forms of renewable energy, farmers may be incentivised to allocate a proportion of624\ntheir crop land to meet on-farm energy use, for example, for diesel fuel replacement or potentially625\nfor high-value low-carbon certified electricity, either produced on-farm or from farm-derived626\nwoody\/residual feedstocks. The ability to co-produce woody biomass for heat and\/or power627\ngeneration at farm scale, alongside commodity crops provides a potentially attractive route to628\nmitigating increased or volatile external energy costs (e.g. for drying, livestock management or629\ndomestic use) and potentially as a saleable commodity in its own right (biomass fuel product(s)).630\nFuture incentivisation for farmers to minimise agricultural GHG emissions is also likely to favour631\ngreater integration of forestry and\/or woody biomass cultivation on farm e.g. short rotation632\ncoppice or perennial grasses such as Miscanthus in UK\/EU. At the individual farm level,633\ncultivation of perennial biomass crops on a proportion of the land may provide an attractive route634\nto \u2018balance\u2019 more GHG intensive cultivation activities with carbon \u2018credits\u2019 from enhanced C-635\nstorage in soils, via avoided emissions from displaced fossil fuel requirements or as a direct636\neconomic benefit from biomass sales at a premium due to renewable heat and power incentive637\nvalue trickling down the supply chain. Recent studies by Hillier et al. (2009) have illustrated the638\nGHG benefits associated with soil carbon storage effects for certain biomass crops and land use639\ntransition scenarios modelled in a LCA context for England and Wales. Attention is also being640\ngiven to the use of biochar2 as a potential energy source (during the charring process) and641\nsignificantly as a soil-based carbon sequestration and storage approach that can also offer soil642\nfertility benefits (Sohi et al.2008; Collison et al. 2009). Biomass supply for biochar production can643\nbe drawn from diverse sources, including woody biomass form agro-forestry systems as well as644\nfrom existing UK farm biomass, such as hedgerow management (Gathorne- Hardy, pers. comm.645\n2009).646\n6 CONCLUDING REMARKS647\nThis paper has identified that there are significant risks to future farming and yields due to648\nincreasing and increasingly volatile fossil fuel prices. Whilst it has been difficult to obtain robust649\nprojections for oil, natural gas and coal prices, it is clear that:650\n1. Fossil fuel prices, particularly those of oil-derived products, will increase significantly651\nover the coming decades and will become more volatile.652\n2. Prices, on a unit energy basis, between oil, gas and coal are likely to diverge with the653\npossibility of a break in the traditional linkage between gas and oil prices emerging. Unless654\nsubstantive agreements emerge from the UNFCCC\u2019s inter-governmental negotiations that655\nlimit access to coal, its large and widely distributed reserves will mean that it is the least656\nvulnerable of the fossil fuels to price increases; a switch to coal away from oil and natural657\ngas is likely where that is possible e.g. for processing and nitrogen fertiliser production.658\n2 Biochar is carbonised biomass or charcoal. When biomass is turned into charcoal and applied to soils it is believed\nto have a half-life in the soil in order of 1000 years.\n3. The world\u2019s major crops are dependent on different shares of their energy inputs from oil,659\ngas and coal. Thus relative changes in fossil fuel prices will affect each crop type660\ndifferentially.661\n4. Major areas of concern are:662\na. Increasing oil prices will directly affect the price of diesel used for tillage, transport663\nof crops from fields and from storage to processing and end use.664\nb. Increasing natural gas prices will have the most immediate effect on nitrogen665\nfertiliser prices.666\nc. Coal is still used for nitrogen fertiliser production, particularly in China, and is667\nlikely to be least affected by worries about reserve depletion. From a GHG668\nperspective, a switch away from oil and gas to coal, rather than to renewable,669\nwould be detrimental.670\nd. Increased costs for direct and indirect energy inputs into agriculture may lead to671\nlower yields for the world\u2019s major agriculture commodity crops. In turn, this is672\nlikely to lead to an expansion of land areas under these crops, in turn leading to673\nincreased GHG emissions, as a result of land use change, and increased prices due674\nto less efficient production. Significant land expansion will also have detrimental675\neffects on biodiversity and possibly on water resources.676\n5. Reasons for optimism:677\na. Substantial gains in efficiency of energy use and GHG emissions are possible in all678\nareas of food and bioenergy supply chains and from both conventional and679\nadvanced supply chains.680\nb. Recent policy developments for bioenergy, and in particular, biofuels, have681\ndemonstrated that the highly complex and heterogeneous systems necessary to682\naccount, monitor, reward and penalise good or bad greenhouse gas and wider683\nsustainability criteria, are amenable to policy. It is possible, and indeed necessary,684\nthat many of the lessons learnt in developing these policies and mechanisms for685\nbiofuels, can be applied to any form of biological production including food.686\nc. New tools, in particular spatial zoning and land management tools, are highlighting687\nthe potential for revised management and crop choices that could allow enhanced688\ncarbon stocking and biodiversity from integrated land management and planning689\nthat couples annual and perennial agriculture.690\nd. The developing of novel drilling technologies that have enabled access to \u2018tight\u2019691\ngas reserves in the US may delay a switch to coal and reduce inflationary pressures692\non nitrogen fertiliser prices.693\nWhilst increasing fossil fuel prices could pose a major risk to agriculture, as production costs694\nincrease, and also cause increased volatility in prices between the different major agricultural695\ncommodities, there is substantial scope for technological and management innovations to occur696\ndecreasing the dependence on fossil energy supplies and in creating opportunities for new markets697\ne.g. in renewable energy. The opportunities and threats will vary substantively between the698\ndifferent crops and a careful review on a crop-by-crop basis is necessary to understand and699\nmanage these threats and the risks to future production posed by increasing fossil fuel prices.700\n701\nReferences702\nADAS. 2009.
