Schematic drawings showing (a) a section through the\nelectrodes and (b) the grid dimensions, together with anexperimental chamber. The electrodes, separated by d \u0004\n2 mm, are immersed in 1:5\u2018 of isotopically pure liquid\nelectron micrograph of some grid material (sample cut from\nthe same sheet), curved in order to show it in more detail.Although the exotic flow properties of He II have been\na subject of intensive investigation ever since the discov-\nery of superfluidity, accumulating a vast amount of ex-\nperimental data and theoretical knowledge [1,2], many\nimportant features still remain to be explained. In the\nlimit of low velocity, He II flow is very well described in\nterms of Landau\u2019s two-fluid model. On exceeding a criti-\ncal velocity, however, quantized vortices appear. Their\npresence couples the originally independent normal and\nsuperfluid velocity fields via a mutual friction. Above\n\u00011:2 K, where He II contains an appreciable proportion\nof normal fluid, numerous investigators observed that, on\nexceeding a suitably defined Reynolds number, He II flow\nacquires an increasingly classical character: (i) the sur-\nface of a rotating bucket forms a nearly classical menis-\ncus [3]; (ii) flow past a microsphere displays both laminar\nand turbulent drag [4], as well as (iii) a drag crisis [5];\n(iv) the energy spectrum of turbulent He II involves an\ninertial range with a classical Kolmogorov roll-off ex-\nponent of \u00025=3 [6]; (v) the decay of both grid-generated\nand counterflow turbulence displays a classical character\n[7\u201310]. Although these features are seen over a wide range\nof normal fluid\/superfluid density ratios, it is impossible\nto exclude the possibility that this classical-like behavior\nis caused by the presence of the viscous normal fluid.\nFollowing oscillating experiments with a tiny sphere [4]\nand a very thin vibrating wire [11], yielding interesting\nresults attributable to single vortices, there is a clear call\nto study the macroscopic flow properties of He II in the\nT ! 0 limit where normal fluid is absent and pure super-\nflow can be investigated systematically.\nOur tool for performing such investigations is the thin\nelectroformed nickel grid shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a\ncircular membrane 2R \u0004 8 cm in diameter, tightly\nstretched on a circular mild steel carrier, mounted hori-\nzontally, equidistant from two gold-plated plane copper\nelectrodes, each drilled with 170 holes of 2 mm inner\ndiameter to connect the grid space to the rest of the0031-9007=04=92(24)=244501(4)$22.504He in an experimental cell attached to the mixing cham-\nber of a dilution refrigerator at \u000150 mK. The apparatus\ncan be operated at pressures up to that of solidification at\n25 bars. A static potential, typically V0 \u0004 500 V, is ap-\nplied to the grid. An oscillatory potential V1 \u0004 V10 cos!t\n(V10 \u0005 V0) applied to the upper electrode exerts a driving\nforce on the grid of form fd \u0004 2\"0\"r\rR2VV1=d2, where\n\"0 and \"r denote, respectively, the permittivity of the\nvacuum and the relative permittivity of liquid 4He. The\ngrid can thus be considered as a driven, oscillating,\nmembrane [12] under uniform tension. We approximate\nits motion as one-dimensional. Oscillations of amplitude\n\u0010D induce a signal of amplitude V2 \u0004 V\u0010D=\u00062d\u0007 on the\nlower electrode, which can be monitored with a lock-in\namplifier (which we use to investigate the low-drive\nlinear response of the grid) or directly with a memory\noscilloscope, allowing visualization of transient pro-\ncesses resulting from the strongly nonlinear response at\nhigher drives.

The response exhibits a first critical\nthreshold of \u000120 mVpp above which the resonant frequency shifts down with increasing drive, and a second critical threshold of\n\u0001200 mVpp above which the frequency shift ceases but the linewidth increases dramatically. Between the thresholds, the response\non resonance is proportional to the drive (see Fig. 3) and the flow remains nondissipative. Doubled symbols indicate places where\nstable beatings were observed. The upper full curve represents the resonant response measured in vacuum (upper frequency axis);\nthe lower full curve is a Lorentzian fit to the data set obtained with the 0:005 Vpp drive.\n1 2\n21\nFIG. 3.

The resonant frequency fres can be altered tempo-\nrarily by a change of pressure \u2014 even if it is then returned\nto its original value. We attribute this to quantized vorti-\nces generated, e.g., by the jet from the filling capillary:\nthey probably become pinned to inhomogeneities on the\ngrid surface, and between the grid and surrounding elec-\ntrodes. Moving the grid violently at high-drive ampli-\ntude, however, is found to stabilize fres reproducibly,\ntypically to within \f0:1 Hz. Presumably, this process\nshakes off the longer loops of pinned vorticity.\nFigure 2 shows our central experimental observation,\nwhich for the \u2018\u2018cleaned\u2019\u2019 grid has been repeated for\nseveral pressures without appreciable change apart from\na shift along the abscissa (see below). As the drive in-\ncreases, the grid amplitude reaches a first critical thresh-\nold of typically 10\u201320 mVpp (corresponding to a mean\ngrid velocity of 0:3< v\u00061\u0007g < 0:6 cm=s). The oscillation\namplitude at resonance continues to rise linearly with the\ndrive (cf. Fig. 3), and the flow remains nondissipative, but\nthe resonant frequency suddenly starts decreasing and the244501-2resonance curves acquire highly nonlinear features. If\none follows, e.g., the resonance curve for the 0:05 Vpp\ndrive down from 1091 Hz (Fig. 2) by slowly sweeping\ndown the drive frequency, the system displays the\nusual nearly Lorentzian stationary response while the244501-2\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending18 JUNE 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 24amplitude remains below the first threshold. On further\ndecreasing the drive frequency, the response amplitude\nincreases more slowly above this first threshold until,\nshortly below 1086 Hz the amplitude suddenly collapses\ndown to a lower stable branch. On increasing the drive\nfrequency again from this point the system stays on the\nlower branch until about 1087.15 Hz, where a transition to\nthe stable upper branch occurs. These hysteretic loops\nare robust to temperature increase, up to our maximum\nof 130 mK.\nWithin the hysteretic parameter range, beat phenomena\nare occasionally seen between two apparently stable am-\nplitude levels, with modulation envelopes of period \u00011 s\n(see, e.g., Fig. 2, drive 0:05 Vpp, near 1086.5 Hz); once\nestablished, they are stable on a scale of hours. Small\nchanges of frequency modify the upper and lower ampli-\ntude levels between which beating occurs. Only with\nfurther change of the driving frequency does the beating\ndisappear. On restoring the original frequency the re-\nsponse is not completely reproducible: within some small\nfrequency range beating might not appear at all; and\nsometimes it reappeared only later. Despite considerable\neffort, we did not succeed in establishing any fully re-\npeatable pattern or well-defined conditions for the ap-\npearance of beats. We noted that, for an oscillation\namplitude exceeding the first threshold, beats occasion-\nally appeared on the left of the resonance peak.\nThe fall in frequency with increasing drive (Fig. 2)\nreaches typically 2 Hz for all investigated pressures (see\nFig. 4), ceasing at a second threshold amplitude (typically0.145 0.150 0.155 0.160 0.165 0.170\n1083\n1084\n1085\n1086\n1087\n1088\n1089\n1090\n1091\n1092\nR\nes\non\nan\nt f\nre\nqu\nen\ncy\n (H\nz)\nDensity (g cm-3)\nPressure (bar)\n0.0 25.05.0 10.0 15.0 20.0\nFIG. 4.

The straight line extrapolates through the zero-\ndensity (vacuum) resonant frequency of f0 \u0004 1117:2 Hz. The\ncorresponding pressures are marked on the upper abscissa. This\nshift of resonant frequency with density is due to the change in\nthe classical hydrodynamic effective mass (see text).\n244501-3200 mVpp corresponding to a mean grid velocity of about\nv\u00062\u0007g \t 6 cm=s). Observation of the two well-defined reso-\nnant frequencies separated by \t 2 Hz is a remarkable\nfeature of superflow that, to our knowledge, has not\npreviously been reported. With further increase in drive,\nthe oscillation amplitude at resonance initially remains\nalmost constant, while the widths of the resonance curves\nincrease rapidly (see Fig. 2). Only for drive levels exceed-\ning by about an order of magnitude that for the second\nthreshold does the amplitude at resonance grow again;\nthis time approximately in proportion to the square root\nof the drive, as shown in Fig. 3. In this high-drive regime\nthe linewidth increases rapidly while the resonant fre-\nquency decreases gradually. Pronounced beatings were\nnever observed in this high-drive regime. If the oscilla-\ntion amplitude is measured as a function of drive level at\nfixed frequency, one observes clear hysteresis within the\nfrequency range containing the two stable branches of the\ngrid response (Fig. 3). Beyond this range, the drive de-\npendences are nonlinear, but without any hysteresis.\nComparison with the grid response at low temperature\nin vacuum (smooth curves in Fig. 2) demonstrate that the\npresence of the He II has two effects. First, it down shifts\nthe low-drive resonant frequency by about 30 Hz from its\nvacuum value of f0 \u0004 \u00061117:2\f 0:05\u0007 Hz, depending on\nthe pressure p in the cell (see Fig. 4). This classical effect\narises from hydrodynamic enhancement of the mass M\nof the grid by \u0010MH \u0004 \u0018%He\u0006p\u0007M=%G, where %G \u0004\n8:902 g cm\u00023 is the density of nickel and %He\u0006p\u0007 is that\nof He II [13]. The measured f0 and low-drive resonant\nfrequencies yield \u0018 \u0004 3:01\f 0:05. We note that, for an\ninfinite elliptical cylinder of the same major and minor\naxes as the cross section of a grid bar, moving along its\nshorter axis, \u0018 \u0004 3 [14]; the close agreement with our\nmeasured \u0018 suggests that our interpretation is along very\nmuch the right lines. Second, it is indeed the He II that is\nresponsible for the observed nonlinearities [15].\nWe believe that the behavior of the oscillating grid\nought to be understandable in terms of quantized vortices\ngenerated in He II by its motion. As one possibility, we\nmay speculate that, on exceeding the first threshold, a\n\u2018\u2018boundary layer\u2019\u2019 of vortex loops grows on the grid, thus\nincreasing its effective mass: sufficiently small vortex\nloops (less than \u00011 \u001bm) can distort adiabatically in\nthe superflow field in such a way as to increase the inertia\nof the grid, but without adding dissipation [16].\nCorrespondingly, the resonant frequency shifts down\nand the resonance curves acquire strongly nonlinear fea-\ntures. Provided that the loops remain pinned, and that\nthey do not reconnect to create free vorticity, the mass\nenhancement is nondissipative, as observed. We note that\nsmall mass enhancements were observed earlier for a\nsphere vibrating in He II above 1 K [17], but without\nassociated critical thresholds.\nIt is interesting to characterize the first threshold by a\nsuperfluid Reynolds number Res \u0004 UmaxG=\u001e, whereUmax244501-3\nP H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending18 JUNE 2004VOLUME 92, NUMBER 24stands for a peak critical flow velocity through the grid\nwindow [18], G is its linear size, and \u001e denotes the\ncirculation quantum. Observed values of Res \u0001 10 com-\npare well with the critical Res \u0004 UD=\u001e \t 20 (U is the\ntransport velocity and D the diameter of the pipe) found\nas a temperature independent threshold in pipe flow of\nHe II at much higher temperature when the flow of the\nnormal component was inhibited by superleaks at both\nends of the pipe [19]. The idea that quantized vortex loops\non the surface of the grid might grow from remanent\nvortex lines [20], or from a \u2018\u2018plasma\u2019\u2019 of half vortex rings\n[21], is supported by the following observation. While\nmeasuring the response dependence on increasing the\ndrive amplitude at the resonant frequency, the system\noften encounters a nucleation problem when passing the\nfirst threshold: on some occasions the resonant response\nstopped growing with increasing drive level, and jumped\non the response\/drive curve (Fig. 3) only later. With\ndecreasing drives this feature is absent, and the response\nremains proportional to the drive level.\nWe infer that, beyond the second critical threshold\n(Fig. 2), the vortex loops probably start to reconnect.\nFree vorticity is then shed into the liquid, corresponding\nto dissipation of the vibrational energy and leading to the\nobserved increase in linewidth. Under these flow condi-\ntions, He II behaves in close analogy with a classical\nNavier-Stokes fluid: the square-root behavior (Fig. 3) of\nthe resonant response as a function of drive amplitude in\nthis range is typical of classical turbulent drag scaling,\nand it is, therefore, likely that this threshold marks the\nonset of turbulence. After leaving the grid, the quantized\nvorticity probably \u2018\u2018evaporates\u2019\u2019 [22] as recently proposed\nin connection with turbulence in superfluid 3He-B [23].\nThe particular challenge posed by these results is to\ndevelop a quantitative description of vortex dynamics in\nthe macroscopic flow around the moving grid, showing\nhow it can give rise to the observed amplitude-dependent\nmass enhancements and reentrant resonance curves,\nwithout dissipation [16]. But the problem also carries\nwider significance, and will repay careful study, because\nthe dynamical processes in question are probably funda-\nmental to the generation of quantum turbulence.\nWe are grateful to N.
