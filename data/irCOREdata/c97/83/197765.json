Although the computer and the Internet were first \nthought to be important tools that would alleviate much of the drudgery of our work, \nleaving more time to \u2018get the job done\u2019, the general view has been that computers and the \nInternet have, in turn, created more work for us. For example, Curley (1989) reported in \nthe late 80s that computerisation had changed \u2018knowledge workers\u2019 jobs. These workers \nhad to acquire new skills and productivity stemmed from skill-broadening rather than \nspecialisation. Rather than reducing anxiety, computers have been a source of anxiety for \nmany in the workplace, especially for older workers, and those not experienced with \ncomputers (Marquie, Thon, & Baracat, 1994).  \nIt is, however, true that the Internet and email have in many ways transformed and \nimproved the workplace. As Greenfield and Davis (2002) claim: \u201cTechnology has \nundoubtedly improved the quality and productivity of our lives at work. The Internet has \nfurther opened up new avenues for increased productivity, greater flexibility, and new \napplications for the work we do\u201d (p. 351). We would agree with Greenfield and Davis\u2019 \n(2002) view that the Internet has not only provided a plethora of information available in \nan instance, but that the Internet can also be used to integrate office locations. \nLang (2001) also points out the advantages the Internet has brought the business \nworld: \nThe Internet is serving also as an intriguing new medium for marketing, and \nhas even streamlined investing. Of course e-mail has vastly improved internal \n  3 \ncommunications at most companies. And, as these changes are wrought, \norganizational environments are becoming more and more information, computation, \nand communication \u2013 rich, while product\/service customization can be performed \nfaster and cheaper. (p. 543) \n \nHowever, while Lang (2001) acknowledges that the Internet can provide companies with \nan incredible amount of information, she quite rightly makes an important distinction \nbetween knowledge and mere information. She also argues that knowledge is \u201cproduced \nand held collectively rather than individually\u201d (p.545-546). Lang suggests that \n\u201c[m]eaningful knowledge cannot be simply retrieved from some database but must be \nactively reconstituted in the moment, in the context of who the community is, and what \nthe particular needs are at that particular moment\u201d (p.545). In order for this to be \nachieved the workplace needs to be structured to allow adequate time and space devoted \nto knowledge creation. This can be virtual or physical space (it is this virtual space that \nwe are most interested in here). However, as Lang argues, \u201ctime, not physical space, is \nthe corporate resource most likely to be begrudged to knowledge activists\u201d (p.546).  \nIn concert with Lang (2001) we also believe that cyberspace can be a potentially \ncreative space, but that the way it is managed and used within organisations needs to be \nurgently redressed. It is argued in this paper that it is not simply how this space is used, \nbut also how it is actually perceived and understood by individuals that ought to be \nreconsidered. \nBefore considering how we might better conceptualise cyberspace, and the ways \npeople operate within this space at work, it is instructive to initially (and briefly) consider \nsome of the problems that are emerging in the workplace since the introduction of the \nInternet and the nature of attempts by employers to deal with these problems. The \n  4 \nproblems that we would like to particularly highlight, as insidious examples, are those of \n\u2018cyberslacking\u2019, harassment and \u2018Netiquette\u2019. It is from a consideration of these \nproblems, and the lack of success of employers in dealing with these problems, that the \nconceptualisation of cyberspace, argued in this paper, becomes most relevant. \n \n1.1 Cyberslacking \nCyberslacking is the overuse of the Internet in the workplace for purposes other \nthan work. Obviously, cyberslacking can be a problem for companies as this can lead to \nloss of productivity and could be considered a waste of companies\u2019 resources. As Davis \n(2001) points out, the U.S. Treasury Department found that Internet activities, such a \npersonal emails, using chat rooms, shopping and checking personal finances and stocks \naccounted for 51% of employee\u2019s time spent online. In one of our own studies conducted \nwithin Australia, there was an overall consensus that the Internet and email should also \nbe used for non-work related purposes in the workplace (Whitty, 2002, 2004). Some of \nthese non-work related activities included: personal emails, information, such as news \nand politics, entertainment, banking, education, research, job search, porn, chat rooms \nand jokes. Interestingly, while some argued quite strongly that the Internet and email \nshould only be used for work purposes; others provided the counter-argument that there \nshould be no restrictions to what workers should be allowed to access within the \nworkplace. As pointed out by Lang (2001) earlier on in this paper, time is a company\u2019s \ngreatest resource, hence, cyberslacking can create huge problems for a company and its \n\u2018bottom-line\u2019. \n \n  5 \n1.2 Cyber-harassment  \nCyber-harassment is increasingly being acknowledged as a problem in the \nworkplace. This type of harassment can take the form of obscene or hate email that \nthreatens or frightens, or emails that contain offensive content, such as sexist or racist \nmaterial. What is unique about this type of workplace harassment, compared to more \ntraditional forms of harassment, is that this material can be sent by people in addition to \nwork colleagues, but other individuals outside of the workplace (either known or not \nknown to the person) or even in the form of spam.  In 1998 Novell carried out a study in \nthe UK on spamming (cited in Driscoll, 1999). A serendipitous finding was that 41% of \nthe women in their sample had been sent pornographic material or had been harassed or \nstalked on the Internet. The problem with spam is that it can (and often does) contain \nsexual and\/or illegal material, however, it is an extremely difficult problem to obviate and \nit is difficult to locate the source of the email. \n Other studies have most recently identified similar problems with the Internet and \nemail in the workplace. In 2001, Elron reported that about one in ten participants stated \nthey had seen fellow workers accessing adult web sites (Elron Software, 2001). \nMoreover, one out of three participants stated that they received sexist material via email \nand one out of eight participants stated that they received racist material via email.  \nIn Whitty\u2019s (2002, 2004) recent research, similar concerns arose. In this \nAustralian wide study, 17% of participants stated that they had been harassed in emails in \ntheir workplace, while 49% said they had received offensive emails. In response to what \ntype of material should be banned in the workplace, a significant proportion of women \n(67%) compared to men (55%) stated that offensive material such as porn should be \n  6 \nbanned. Furthermore, women disagreed more strongly than men did in their responses to \nwhether workers should be permitted to access sexual material from the web at work.  \nWhile individuals are overall concerned about the material available at work on \nthe Internet and the types of annoying emails they receive, they nevertheless approve of \nusing the Internet and email for personal usage. What appears to be a stark contradiction \nis that some of this personal usage could, in turn, annoy, offend or potentially harass \nothers. For example, in the aforementioned Elron study, 70% of participants stated that \nthey commonly send jokes and chain mail via email (Elron Software, 2001). In one of our \nown studies, we were somewhat surprised with the finding that one third of our sample of \n524 participants believed it was acceptable for workers to discuss sexual matters at work \n(Whitty, 2002, 2004). What particularly concerns us about this result are three major \nquestions: (1). What kind of sexual details are being discussed?  \n(2). Are these emails ever seen by other employees and if so is this construed as \nharassment? and, (3). Have there been instances were employees have accidentally sent \nthese emails to someone for whom it was not intended? \nIn considering the above empirical research, there is a noteworthy corollary of \nignoring this form of harassment. If effective strategies are not implemented to prevent \ncyber-harassment, women could begin to fear using the Internet (even if this type of \nharassment has not directly affected them). We single out women here given that to date \nwomen are said to be more cyber-harassed than men (Hatcher, 1997). There are a number \nof disadvantages that accompany fear of using the Internet. For example, women are \ndisadvantaged in the workplace, where the Internet is a resource that is increasingly being \nutilised. Furthermore, women are disadvantaged in educational settings where educators \n  7 \nare required to use the Internet as an educational tool. Recently, the Nielsen ratings \n(2002) found that the number of women online has increased to equal proportions of men \nto women. However, they also found that men go online more often, spend more time \nonline and view more pages than women do. Researchers, such as Brail (1996), have \nnoted that sexual harassment on the Internet means that cyberspace is not a \u2018safe\u2019 and \nfriendly environment for women. She argues that this, in part, explains why women \nspend less time online than men spend. If the fear of sexual harassment on the net were to \nincrease, the gradual advances that are being made to narrow the gender gap online will \nbe to no avail. \n \n1.3 Netiquette \nAnother unexpected problem that has emerged in the workplace is the variety of \ntypes of emails individuals construct and indiscriminately send to others they know. \nWhile offensive emails might appear to be an obvious concern, a surprising result that \nemerged from one of our studies is the concern employees have with having to waste \ntime sifting through and deleting email from known sources - typically friends (Whitty, \n2002, 2004). In this Australian survey, it was found that chain emails (90%) were more \nobjectionable than spam types of email such as credit offers (88%) and porn (77%). \nInterestingly, 17% of the sample found joke email objectionable. These results are \nextraordinary, given that the problem is created by people\u2019s own volition. Contrary to the \nsuspicion that workers are all cyberslacking, these results suggest that employees want to \ndesist wasting time on unwanted emails. These results also clearly highlight they we need \nto re-think how we use the Internet and email and develop a better Netiquette. For \n  8 \nexample, developing lists of friends and unquestioning pressing the send key which \ndelivers an email that the individual found funny or interesting might not be the \nappropriate way to deal with email. It appears, however, that once people put their \nmessage in cyberspace they do not consider the consequences of that email at the other \nend. \n \n1.4 Attempts at solving these problems \nCompanies have attempted to deal with these problems noted above, most \ncommonly by devising Internet usage policies. Greenfield and Davis (2002) report that \n83% of the companies they surveyed had such policies in place. In our recent Australian \nstudy (Whitty, 2002), we found that 62% of participants worked in a company that had an \nInternet usage policy. However, what was alarming was that 19% of the sample did not \nknow if they had a policy (Whitty, 2002, 2004). This suggests that policies are not always \nclearly communicated to employees. However, the other problem that has emerged is that \neven when the policies are transparent workers are not all adhering to these policies, as \nillustrated in the following quote: \u2018\u2018I work in a large workforce, and it is difficult to \noversee usage of Internet. Although policies are in place, some choose to ignore\u2019\u2019 (cited \nin, Whitty, 2003a). The question we then need to ask is why are people ignoring their \nwork policies? We would like to suggest here that one reason might be that the work \nrules stand in some conflict with the seductivenature of the Internet. Hence, disciplinary \nmeasures might not be the most effective way of dealing with these problems and instead \nsolutions might arise from considerations \nof the seductive nature of the net. \n  9 \nIn addition to considerations of the nature of cyberspace we also need to remind \nourselves that anti-discrimination laws and workplace policies have already been in place \nfor years to obviate problems in respect to discrimination in the workplace. It is \ninteresting that while individuals understand that this might relate to pictures they display \non the wall or a calendar, and the way they address others, that they do not always \ngeneralise such laws and policies to the Internet and email. This paper makes an attempt \nto explain why this might be so. \n Another way organisations are attempting to deal with the Internet problems \noutlined above, is through implementing surveillance technology and filtering software. \nEmployers use these devises to either monitor or block-out certain sites or emails that a \ncompany deems inappropriate in the workplace. In the aforementioned Australian survey \n43% of the sample worked in a company where the Internet and email were being \nfiltered, however, a sizeable proportion (17%) were again oblivious to whether they were \nbeing filtered or not. Greenfield and Davis (2002) found that 79% of the companies they \nsurveyed were making either a considerable or at least some effort to monitor employee \nuse of the Internet. They found that the type of methods employed to monitor included: \n38% of companies used filtering software, 22% used self-oversight and 37% had \nmanagerial oversight.  \n Again monitoring techniques and filtering software are not always successful. \nOne reason for this is because filtering software is not yet sophisticated enough and can \neither still allow access to Internet sites and emails that are not deemed appropriate to a \nparticular organisation, or sometimes block sites that are deemed appropriate and \nnecessary to access for that particular company. The other problem is how surveillance \n  10 \nand filtering techniques affect employees\u2019 morale. For example, Chalykoff and Kochan \n(1989) have argued that employees\u2019 satisfaction with computer-aided monitoring has a \nlarge impact on overall job satisfaction. In our own research, while we have found that \nmany participants are happy to have some web sites and emails filtered, 19% opposed \nany kind of Internet filtering in the workplace (Whitty, 2002, 2004). Reasons given as to \nwhy people are opposed to filtering include: a belief that employee\u2019s have a right to use \nthe web for some play or personal, non-work related activities, that filtering constrains \npeople\u2019s freedom (which they have a right to) and that people should be trusted and \nshould take responsibility for their own actions (Whitty, 2003a) - some of these attitudes \nare nicely illustrated in the following quotes from participants in this previous study: \n \n\u201cTime spent using Internet for personal reasons should remain private and I always \nmake sure I make this time up. Allowing people to take personal responsibility for their \npersonal use lifts moral which benefits productivity in the long term.\u201d \n \n\u201cI strongly believe that some things such as music, and other things which help people \nrelax are highly beneficial to the workplace. If it helps me work, then my employers \nshould be happy and encourage this sort of stuff.\u201d \n \n\u201cI believe everyone should have the freedom of perusing the internet, and for most people \nthis will empower them. A small minority will abuse access at the expense of their work.\u201d \n \n\u201c\"Rules\" are better than filters. Trust is a better thing for employee moral than a big \nbrother software solution. It's a small company - I think that any web access policy would \nbe honoured by the employees.\u201d \n \nAnother way to deal with the problem, according to Davis et al. (2002) is to use \npreventative measures such as identifying who the workers are who have problematic \nInternet use. In their study, they identified a latent construct, they name \u201cProblematic \nInternet Use\u201d, which was determined by four indicators, including, impulsivity, \nloneliness\/depression, distraction and social comfort. Hence, they found that Problematic \n  11 \nInternet Use is more than simply spending too much time online. These researchers \nsuggest that instead of using reactive solutions to Internet problem behaviour in the \nworkplace, we should be using preventative strategies. While we believe that Davis et \nal.\u2019s research is an important contribution to the rather scant empirical research available \non Problematic Internet Use, we would like to point out a couple of limitations in its \napplication. First, the type of problematic behaviours these authors are referring to are \nmore severe psychological problems. As a consequence, their study still does not address \nsome of the problems we outlined above, such as harassing problems, less severe forms \nof cyberslacking (which still cost companies considerable amounts of money) and \nNetiquette issues. Moreover, by screening people out to either decide on whether they \nshould be allowed to work in an organisation or to set up different conditions for them in \na workplace seems to us to be considerably discriminatory, especially when 100% \nreliability of the test cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, these authors argue that similar \ntests are already in place in organisations to predict theft; however, we would question \nwhether Internet problem behaviour ought to be treated in the same way as people who \nsteal. \n \n \n2. Object-relations theory \nWhile we believe that all of the above strategies have their merits, we would like \nto advance an argument that we think also contributes to the ongoing exploration of \npossible solutions to Internet and email problems in the workplace. In grappling with how \npeople understand and work within cyberspace we think it is instructive to draw from \n  12 \nobject-relations theory, in particular to use a conceptual lens that comes from the work of \nDonald Winnicott, Christopher Bollas and Melanie Klein. \nDonald Woods Winnicott used the term \u2018potential space\u2019 to mean the space \nbetween the mother and the infant. He contrasted this \"potential space (a) with the inner \nworld (which is related to the psychosomatic partnership) and (b) with actual, or external \nreality\" (1971\/1997, p.41). Winnicott understood potential spaces to be an area of \nintermediate experiencing that is between inner and outer worlds, \u201cbetween the subjective \nobject and the object objectively perceived\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 100). Winnicott \n(1971\/1997) argued that the potential space is: \nthe hypothetical area that exists (but cannot exist) between the baby and the object \n(mother of part of mother) during the phase of the repudiation of the object as not-me, \nthat is, at the end of being merged in with the object. (p. 107) \n \nAlthough Winnicott believed that potential space originates between the mother \nand the infant, he also argued that later on it becomes possible for the individual child or \nadult to develop his\/her own capacity to generate potential space. For example, he \nproposed that such spaces could exist between the patient and analyst. While Winnicott \ncould be criticised for developing a universal assumption about the relationship between \nthe mother and infant, (and he often wrote in a very patronising tone towards mothers) \nWinnicott\u2019s notions are still highly useful. \nAccording to Winnicott, potential space is the place where play takes place. As \nWinnicott expresses: \nThe place where cultural experience is located is in the potential space between \nthe individual and the environment (originally the object). The same can be said of \nplaying. Cultural experience begins with creative living first manifested in play. (p. \n100) \n \n  13 \nPotential space is not inner psychic reality, rather, it \u201cis outside the individual, but it is \nnot the external world\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 51). Potential space is not pure fantasy, \nbut nor is it pure reality. As Carr and Downs (2004, in press) clearly express: \n\u2026play is intersubjective, and play creates a separate reality. Winnicott viewed \nplay as creative communication, as intersubjective. Play would not occur in the \ncontext of the subject alone. Play takes into account other subjectivites and an \nenvironment that responds to the subject. In addition, Winnicott viewed play as \ncreating and sustaining illusion, which can be maintained if kept within a frame of its \nown \u2013 a frame that separates it from ordinary life. \n \nWinnicott (1971\/1997) also believed that play is as an important activity during \nadulthood as it is in childhood. He went as far to argue that play is central to individual \ngrowth. It is in Winnicott\u2019s potential space that meanings and self are continually being \ncreated and re-created. Winnicott (1971\/1997) strongly contended that \u201cit is only in being \ncreative that the individual discovers the self\u201d (p.54). Hence, he argued that given a \n\u201cgood enough\u201d environment the interplay of the inner world and external reality \npromotes the development of self and facilitates growth. In other words, it is play that is \nthe universal, and that belongs to health: \nplaying facilitates growth and therefore health; playing leads into group \nrelationships; playing can be a form of communication in psychotherapy; and lastly, \npsychoanalysis has been developed as a highly specialised form of playing in the \nservice of communication with oneself and others. (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41) \n \nThe rules that are formed during play are also a notable aspect of Winnicott\u2019s \ntheory. How we play the game and what rules we develop in order for play to take place, \nare questions we need to consider when we explore Winnicott\u2019s potential space. Modell \n(1990) explains the rules of the game as: \n \n  14 \nPlaying takes place in a certain space and has certain limitations regarding the duration \nof time, as in games that are \u201cplayed out\u201d within a certain limit of time. Yet playing \nmay have its own quality of timelessness. Playing is also separated from ordinary life \nby the \u201crules of the game\u201d: all play has its rules that pertain to the temporary world in \nwhich playing takes places. Rules are in effect a means of containing a space in which \nillusions can flourish. (p. 27) \n \nTherefore, while play does have a sense of freedom, it is nonetheless constrained by \nrules. As Carr and Downs (2004, in press) argue \u201cOn the one had the fundamental \nessence of play is the freedom and the license to create. Yet, on the other hand, constraint \nin the form of rules is required.\u201d Given this juxtaposition between play and constraint, \nCarr (2001) contends that play transcends the serious and non-serious oppositional \nbinary. \nWinnicott used the term \u201ctransitional object\u201d to refer to the object that connects \nself and other. Winnicott noticed, for example, how an infant would suck and hug a doll \nor blanket. He suggested that the doll or blanket did not represent a doll or blanket as \nsuch, but is rather an as-if object. The infant makes use of the illusion that although this is \nnot the breast, treating it as such will allow an appreciation of what is \u201cme\u201d and what is \n\u201cnot-me\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 41). Although referred to as a transitional object, \u201cit \nis not the object, of course that is transitional\u201d (Winnicott, 1971\/1997, p. 14). The object \nis the initial manifestation of a different positioning of the infant in the world. The doll or \nblanket, thus, connects to subjective experience, but is in the objective world. \nAccording to object-relations theorists, objects are often symbolically charged, \ntypically at an unconscious level. As Carr and Downs have highlighted, Freud \n(1905\/1977; 1933\/1988) believed that \u201cobjects are the targets towards which action or \ndesire is directed in order to satisfy instinctual satisfaction.\u201d \n  15 \nChristopher Bollas has elaborated further on Winnicott\u2019s work, with a particular \nfocus on the nature of transitional objects. According to Bollas (1987; 1992) transitional \nobjects, like all objects, themselves leave a trace within us. Bollas (1992, p. 59) argues \nthat \"as we encounter the object world \u2026 we are substantially metamorphosed by the \nstructure of objects; internally transformed by objects that leave their trace within us\". \nSome objects seem to have much more inner meaning for us and unlock unconscious \nthought processes and affective states. In a sense, Bollas argues, these objects are \n\"transformational\" and may act like \"psychic keys\" (see also Carr, 2003). The objects \nthemselves, in acting as psychic keys, appear to enable past unconscious experiences to \nbe released to inform present behaviour. In respect to online interactions, we would \nsuggest that the transitional objects such as, the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, \nmodems, and so forth \"leave a trace\" within us such that they trigger emotional \nresponses, such as expectations, passion, and curiosity which are reminders of previous \nInternet \u2018encounters\u2019. \n Another theory we would like to draw up in this paper is Melanie Klein\u2019s (1975) \nwell known object-relations theory. One of the aspects of her theory that we are utilising \nin this paper is her notion of splitting. According to Klein, splitting behaviour involves \ndichotomising the world into \u2018good\u2019 objects and \u2018bad\u2019 objects. Klein believed that the \ninfant in the paranoid-schizoid position wants to posses the contents of the mother\u2019s \nbody, while at the same time wanting to destroy her. She believed these responses arose \nfrom the death instinct. This is succinctly summarised by Doane and Hodges (1992) \nwhen they observe that: \nThe infant is motivated to both possess and destroy the mother not only by \nconstitutional aggression but also because of simultaneous perception of the mother as \n  16 \nthe source of all good things. Yet the mother is not simply a source of plenitude, given \nthe infant\u2019s ability to fragment in phantasy, the mother into \u201cpart objects\u201d \u2013 milk, \nfeces, breast, penis, children. (p. 9) \n \nKlein also included in her object-relations theory other defence mechanisms delineated \nby Freud, including introjection and denial. To quote from Klein (1986): \nIdealization is bound up with the splitting of the object, for the good aspects of the \nbreast are exaggerated as a safeguard against the fear of the persecuting breast. While \nidealization is thus the corollary of persecutory fear, it also springs from the power of \nthe instinctual desires which aim at unlimited gratification and therefore create the \npicture of an inexhaustible and always bountiful breast \u2013 an ideal breast\u2026.The denial \nof psychic reality becomes possible only through strong feelings of omnipotence \u2013 an \nessential characteristic of early mentality. Omnipotent denial of the existence of the \nbad object and of the painful situation is in the unconscious equal to annihilation by \nthe destructive impulse. It is, however, not only a situation and an object that are \ndenied and annihilated \u2013 it is an object relation which suffers this fate\u2026 (p. 182). \n \n3.Getting beyond the problems: Conceptualising cyberspace \nWe have previously proposed that cyberspace could be understood as potential \nspace (Whitty, 2003b; Whitty & Carr, 2003). We have argued this in respect to cyber-\nflirting and the games people play at love on the Internet. However, we believe this view \nof cyberspace can be equally applied to the workplace. As we have suggested in the past, \ncyberspace could be considered as a space somewhere outside the individual, but is still \nnot the external world. Important to the arguments formed in this paper, we contend that \nthe participants, the computers, monitors, keyboards, mice, software, modems, text, \ncables, telephone lines, and so forth all occupy this potential space; this space between \nthe individuals who interact within this space. We would even go as far to state that the \nweb should be conceptualised as a potential playground. \n It is in such a context that we argue that a new space has been introduced in the \nworkplace, this new space, allows for new kinds of play within organisations, between \n  17 \norganisations and even inclusive of individuals outside of the workplace. As described \nearlier in this paper, in Winnicott\u2019s potential space, meanings are created and re-created. \nPlaying in such as space promotes the development of self. We would like to extend this \nto argue that it can promote the development of an organisation. If it is agreed that \ncyberspace can be understood as a potential space, then individuals can play within such \na space to develop the growth of themselves and, in turn, their organisations.  \nLang\u2019s (2001) distinction between information and knowledge is an important one \nand would like to relate this to our understanding of cyberspace being a kind of potential \nspace. One can download incredible amounts of information from the Internet, however, \nif one is not engaging with the material or \u2018playing\u2019 with the material, then is knowledge \nreally being created? As Lang contends, knowledge is produced collectively. Cyberspace \nprovides an opportunity for individuals to work together to engage with material, play \nwith material and hence create knowledge. What is also unique to cyberspace, unlike \nother mediums, is the greater access to playmates, which individuals can choose to \nconverse with simultaneously. We believe that it is through this playing that \norganisations can reap the benefits of cyberspace. \n One common way people have used their short break time in the workplace is by \nchatting round the water-cooler or whilst making cups of tea, or having cigarette breaks. \nWhile this may have been perceived by both the people engaging in this activity and their \nfellow workers as more play-time than work-time, nevertheless there has been some \nutility in having these conversations and time out from what is formally constituted as \n\u2018work\u2019. These interactions can be a way of sharing information, which leads to creating \nknowledges. We would like to make the point that in a similar way cyberspace can be a \n  18 \nplace where this kind of play or break-time can be spent. This is illustrated from the \nfollowing extracts from participants in one of our previous studies (Whitty, 2003a):  \n \n\u201cThe WWW and email are an increasingly important communication and information \ntool. People need to practice to build up expertise in both using the technology and \ninterpreting (value-adding) to info they access by ICT.\u201d \n \n\u201cConsidering some of the hours that people are required to work these days, people are \noften isolated from the rest of the working Australia, ie, the bank, news, current events \netc. It helps staff remain in touch with society.\u201d \n \n\u201cI have no problem with being updated on what is happening in the world while I am \nstuck in a little office, as long as people are not just sitting there constantly browsing the \nweb etc\u2026\u201d \n \nOf course, people\u2019s break time around the water-cooler is not solely spent on \ncreating new knowledge. It can be simply a way to have a short break, so that one can \nmove back to their work with a fresh mind and as a consequence of the short break be \nmore productive. Again, cyberspace can also be used in this way as expressed by some of \nthe participants in our previous work: \n \n\u201cPeople occasionally need some down time regardless of whether they have a break or \nnot, and our job is too all encompassing to rule out anything as non work related.\u201d \n \n\u201cInnocuous content should be available to workers. Sometimes it helps me take a short \nbreak from a mammoth task I've been working on for 3 hours straight, it helps me relax \nfor a bit so that I can complete the task.\u201d \n \nHence, while some playtime might not be spent directly on work tasks, it can still be a \nmeans of increasing an individual\u2019s productivity. \n Although we do make the claim that cyberspace can be an important and \nproductive place for workers to play in, we do not dismiss employers\u2019 concerns that their \n  19 \nworkers are cyberslacking, harassing or using the Internet and email inappropriately in \nthe workplace. While cyberspace is a place where new important creative processes can \ntake place, we need to question what happens if an individual strays too close to the \nborders of reality or fantasy? As Civin (2000) has emphatically argued \u201cJust as \ncyberspace may potentiate, it may also thwart and debilitate\u201d (p.40).  \n When we consider that cyberspace is a new place to play in the workplace, we \nalso need to consider the rules that accompany this new activity. As pointed out earlier, \nWinnicott contends that we need to consider the rules of the game, as while play is \nseparated from the ordinary world, it is still constrained by the rules. We believe that the \nrules on how to play in cyberspace at work are still currently being devised. We \nmentioned earlier on in this paper that while clear policies have been constructed in the \nworkplace in respect to harassing and discriminatory behaviour, these rules are not \nconsistently applied by workers in respect to the Internet and email behaviour. One \nreason we would like to offer for this is because cyberspace is considered to be a different \nkind of space in the workplace, a place where the rules are still being negotiated and \ndefined. It would be reasonable to assume that this space is perceived by workers to be a \nmore private space and quite separate to the \u2018real\u2019 world. An employee might see this as a \nspace that is, in a sense, more one\u2019s own space where an employer has not right to intrude \nupon and effectively spy on an individual. The conceptual optic developed in this paper \nwould suggest that it is perceived to be a space where people can feel more liberated and \nfree, which could be in stark contrast to the physical office space these individuals work \nin. This illusion of privacy is perhaps sustained given that work colleagues are not \nnecessary privy to the conversations that take place online and the information that is \n  20 \ndownloaded. This is quite different to the conversations that take place in the workplace \nin either face to face or telephone, where one is accountable for one\u2019s actions given that \nothers can witness them. Of course, the reality is that while workers might be sustaining \nan illusion in respect to cyberspace being a more private space, this is not the case. Others \ncan see colleagues\u2019 computer monitors, the computer keeps a trace of where the \nindividual has been surfing on the Internet, those who have access to the server have \naccess to emails being sent back and forth, and commonly emails are accidentally sent to \npeople they were not intended for. That being said, we nonetheless would argue that \npeople often separate themselves from this reality when they log on into cyberspace. \nHence given the separateness of this space to other spaces, are not applying old rules to \nthis new form of communication. \nIt is here that we believe Klein\u2019s theory is useful. According to Klein, part of a \nparanoid-schizoid defensive condition is splitting the world into \u2018good\u2019 objects and \u2018bad\u2019 \nobjects. The implications are noted by Doane and Hodges (1992) when they argue that: \n \nBy greedily introjecting good part objects, splitting them off from bad part objects \n(objects created by the infant\u2019s own aggression in the mirror of its own sadism), the \ninfant defends itself in this position from complete disintegration. The bad objects are \nfelt to persecute the infant \u2013 hence its paranoia \u2013 and this anxiety leads to the defenses \nof splitting, projection, and introjection. In turn, these defenses are vulnerable. (p.9) \n \nIf we consider, as argued earlier, that one of the objects that occupy cyberspace is the \ntext, we can identify some interesting splitting behaviour that appears to take place here. \nA type of splitting between good and bad objects has been identified in our empirical \nwork (Whitty, 2002, 2004). We pointed out earlier on in this paper the contradictions in \npeople\u2019s attitudes towards Internet and email behaviour in the workplace. It appears that \n  21 \nfor some, double standards are being applied, where it is acceptable for an individual to \ntalk about sexual matters or to send chain or joke emails, while at that same time \ndisapproving of sexual content on the web, offensive emails and being sent chain emails. \n We could also again consider Lang\u2019s (2001) distinction between information and \nknowledge here. If people are greedily searching for and collecting information, the good \npart objects, from the web, one is not necessarily using the web in the best possible way. \nPeople\u2019s quest for too much information can be a determent to both the individual as well \nas the organisation they are working for. Put in this light, it is not necessary the content \nwe need to be concerned with or the even necessarily the time people are spending \nonline, but rather how they are using the information they are collecting. This, we \nbelieve, frames cyberslacking in a different light. \nThe relationship people have with these objects that occupy cyberspace also needs \nto be considered. As mentioned earlier, Winnicott believed that objects that occupy \npotential space can be transitional. However, we need to be clear that it is not the object \nitself that is transitional. In turn, not all objects in cyberspace will act as transitional \nobjects. Hence, it is how people relate to and use objects in cyberspace that has some \nimportant repercussions in the workplace. If we use and play with these objects \ncreatively, then there is the opportunity to create knowledge.  \nBollas\u2019 view that transitional objects leave a trace within us is an important point \nto consider when we examine objects in cyberspace. By way of example, Lupton (1995) \nhas described the affect of turning on her computer:  \n \nWhen I turn my personal computer\u2026it makes a little sound. This little sound I \nsometimes playfully interpret as a cheerful \u2018Good morning\u2019 greeting, for the action of \n  22 \nbringing my computer to life usually happens first thing in the morning\u2026.In \nconjunction with my cup of tea, the sound helps to prepare me emotionally and \nphysically for the working day ahead, a day that will involve much tapping on the \ncomputer keyboard and staring into the pale blue face of the display monitor\u2026 (p.97) \n \nThe computer in some ways can been seen as an extension of self, which is perhaps why \npeople feel this is an object that contains private information. Hence, individuals ascribe \na very different meaning to their computer than they would to other objects in an office. \nFor example, putting a calendar on the wall is seen as inappropriate perhaps because this \nis understood to be a public space.  \nIn a similar way to Lupton\u2019s reaction, the sound of a new email could also act as a \npsychic key. However, if spam increases, together with offensive Internet material and \nnuisance email, then it is possible that reactions to our computers and cyberspace could \nchange in meaning. This is something companies need to be aware of if they want to use \ncyberspace as an asset to their companies. \nFinally, we would like to highlight the importance of how we play with the \nobjects in cyberspace. In doing so we would like to draw from Michel Serres\u2019 (1995) \nwork on quasi-objects. Carr and Downs (2004, in press) have suggested a parallel \nbetween Winnicott\u2019s notion of transitional objects and Serres\u2019 work on quasi-objects. The \ndifference they state is the while Winnicott was interested in an individual\u2019s relationship \nwith an object, Serres has focused how \u201can object pass through a social group and, in so \ndoing, forms relations among the members of that group.\u201d To quote from Serres\u2019(1995) : \n \nLook at those children out there, playing ball. The clumsy ones are playing with the \nball as if it was an object, while the more skillful ones handle it as if it were playing \nwith them: they move and change position according to how the ball moves and \nbounces. As we see it, the ball is being manipulated by human subjects; this is a \n  23 \nmistake \u2013 the ball is creating the relationships between them. It is in the following its \ntrajectory that their team is created, knows itself and represents itself. Yes, the ball is \nactive. It is the ball that is playing. (pp. 47 \u201348) \n \nWe can see that Serres\u2019 notion of quasi-objects can also be applied to cyberspace and the \nworkplace. With the advent of the Internet individuals have greater access to \ncommunicate and create knowledge not only with other colleagues within that \norganisation, but also with individuals who work in other organisations and those who do \nnot identify themselves with any workplace. Watching how the ball is playing can be \nobserved in the interactions that are played out in chat rooms, through instant messaging, \ndiscussion boards and so forth.  \n \n4. Some final thoughts: A quest for new beginnings \nThis paper commenced with an identification of problems that have arisen in the \n\u2018management\u2019 of access to cyberspace and the manner in which employees have \n\u2018engaged\u2019 the object called the computer in what might be considered to be non-\nproductive behaviour. In general, the measures employed thus far to curb the excesses \nand difficulties with such behaviour have been partially successful while, at the same \ntime, being less than aware of the seductive and productive nature of the Internet. Clearly \nbefore we can start to be effective in excesses of some employees, we first need to \nadequately conceptualise why employees seek to engage in such behaviour in the first \nplace. Moreover, we need a conceptual lens that helps us appreciate the benefits of \nInternet access to the employees\u2019 state of wellbeing as well as how that is transformed \ninto a healthier and productive workforce. \n  24 \n At the moment research into Internet usage has yielded, putatively, a \u2018puzzling\u2019 \narray of findings that on the surface seem to complicate simple notions of Internet \nbehaviour at work. These research findings are less puzzling when viewed through the \nconceptual lens of object relations that is outlined in this paper. The new rules in the \nworkplace over the use of the Internet, clearly need to be communicated to all employees \nand designed in a manner that, from an objects relations perspective, integrates with a \nrecognition that the Internet is a potential space for play. There is also a need for new \nresearch that seeks to frame its\u2019 observations in a manner that admits an object relations \nperspective \u2013 in doing so we may more effectively target our \u2018rules\u2019 in the workplace to \nenhance the productive use of the Internet. \n \n \n \n \n  \n  25 \nReferences \n \nBollas, C.
