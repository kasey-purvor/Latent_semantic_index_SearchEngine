It\ncan be caused by a congenital abnormality, chronic venous insufficiency, damage to the lymphatic system following treatment of\ncancer or filariasis, a parasitic infection endemic in parts of India and Africa. Skin care is important as the affected tissues gradually\nthicken and are susceptible to inflammation and infections. People are also encouraged to exercise regularly and control their weight.\nDifferent physical treatments aimed at improved lymph drainage include multi-layer bandaging, manual lymph drainage (MLD), self-\nadministered massage and compression sleeves or hosiery.\nThe authors of this review, which aimed to assess the effect of physical treatment programmes on the long-term control of lymphoedema,\nidentified only three controlled trials for inclusion. These randomised a total of 150 adults to different levels of physical treatment. One\ntrial involved 42 women with unilateral lymphoedema of the upper limb following treatment for breast cancer. One group received\neight sessions of MLD in two weeks and training in self-massage and both this group and the control group wore flat-knit compression\nsleeves. The reductions in excess arm volume and symptoms were similar in the two groups.\nA second trial involved 25 women from a local follow-up breast clinic. They were trained in self-administered massage and randomised\nto wear an elastic compression sleeve or no additional treatment. The dropout rate was high, particularly in the control group, although\nthe authors concluded that wearing a compression sleeve was beneficial. The third trial involved 83 mostly female participants from a\nlymphoedema clinic. Around two thirds had upper limb oedema. They were all taught self-administered massage. One group received\na 19-day bandaging course before being fitted with hosiery. The other group wore hosiery from the start of the trial. The reduction in\nexcess limb volume was consistently greater in those who started with multi-layer bandaging.\nAll three trials had methodological limitations, and as their data could not be combined, and they recruited only small numbers of\nparticipants, questions relating to the effect of this type of treatment could not be answered by this review.\nB A C K G R O U N D\nLymphoedema is a chronic and progressive condition resulting\nfrom an abnormality of, or damage to the lymphatic system. Any\nreduction in the capacity of the lymphatic system to drain fluid\nfrom the interstitium and return it to the blood circulation will\ncause fluid to build up in the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the\naffected part of the body (Levick 1991; Mortimer 1995).\nLymphoedema has many causes but the main ones are:\n2Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\u2022 Cancer and its treatment - leading to secondary\nlymphoedema;\n\u2022 Congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system - so\ncalled primary lymphoedema;\n\u2022 Chronic Venous Disease of the lower limb - lympho-venous\noedema;\n\u2022 Filariasis, a parasitic infection - leading to secondary\nlymphoedema\nThe incidence of lymphoedema following breast cancer treatment\nis difficult to assess due to differences in assessments of diagno-\nsis, measurement and follow up time. Petrek 1998 and Erickson\n2001 conducted systematic reviews to assess the incidence of breast\ncancer lymphoedema. The included studies assessed the incidence\nin Europe, Australia and North America. Using different search\nstrategies Petrek 1998 found eight studies which included inci-\ndence and Erickson 2001 found ten including potentially two\nstudies which were too recent to include in the review by Petrek\n1998. Four papers were included in both reviews although one pa-\nper was judged to be retrospective by Petrek 1998 and prospective\nby Erickson 2001. Three methods of assessing lymphoedemawere\nincluded; volume, limb circumference and self-report. The time\nscale used for follow up also varies. Petrek 1998 report incidence\nfigures of 6 to 30% however the table used to explain these figures\nis unclear. Only papers which covered axillary dissection were used\nin the review by Erickson 2001 and a range of 2.4 to 56% is found.\nThe range in follow up, if details were available at all, seems to re-\nsult in this wide variety in findings. The figures for lymphoedema\nof the lower limb are even less reliable but it appears to be a ma-\njor problem. In many other cancers (for example melanoma, soft\ntissue sarcoma and pelvic tumours) the treatment often compro-\nmises lymphatic drainage routes; chronic venous insufficiency is\nalso a major contributory factor in the development of chronic\nlower limb oedema, as is filariasis, a parasitic infection endemic\nin parts of India and Africa. Moffatt 2003 surveyed healthcare\nproviders in South West London and found a crude prevalence of\nlymphoedema from any cause of 1.33 per 100,000. The incidence\nof arm oedema was much higher in women, which reflects the\nlarge number of women developing lymphoedema following the\ndevelopment of breast cancer.\nLymphoedema can result in significant physical and psychological\nmorbidity. Swelling causes a disproportion in the size of a part of\nthe body and as such can interfere with mobility and affect the suf-\nferers\u2019 perceptions of themselves (Tobin 1993). In addition to an\nincrease in size, the affected subcutaneous tissues gradually thicken\nand fibrose forming a solid component to the swelling (Foldi\n1985; Mortimer 1995). Pain and discomfort feature among the\nphysical problems associated with lymphoedema (Badger 1988;\nCarroll 1992), as do recurrent attacks of infection\/inflammation (\nMortimer 1995); the latter are a result of reduced local immunity\nin the affected part of the body. The shape of the limb can become\ndistorted (Badger 1997). The impact of these physical and psy-\nchosocial difficulties on the patients\u2019 quality of life has attracted\nlittle research interest. As things stand, the pre-morbid state has\nnot been identified so that the prevention of lymphoedema is not\nyet an option.\nThe management of this condition involves decongesting the re-\nduced lymphatic pathways in order to reduce the size of the limb;\nencouraging the development of collateral drainage routes and\nstimulating the function of remaining patent routes so as to con-\ntrol the swelling long-term (Foldi 1985; Mortimer 1995).\nTraditionally, treatment in continental Europe has followed a\n\u201ctwo-phase\u201d approach. In the first phase a collection of different\nphysical treatments are employed simultaneously for a course of\ndaily treatment; these usually include:\n\u2022 Multi-layer bandaging\n\u2022 Care of the skin\n\u2022 Manual lymph drainage (MLD)\n\u2022 Exercises to promote lymph drainage.\n\u2022 Pneumatic compression (is sometimes also included here).\nThis phase aims to reduce the size of the limb, reverse any distor-\ntion in the shape of the limb and any hardening of the subcuta-\nneous tissues and improve the health of the skin.\nIn the second phase of treatment patients are usually required to:\n\u2022 Wear strong compression hosiery to maintain the reduction\nin swelling;\n\u2022 Carry out regular daily exercise;\n\u2022 Have regular MLD, where possible.\nThe aim here is to maintain the improvements gained in the first\nphase.\nThere is a great deal of debate as towhich components of a physical\ntreatment programme are the most crucial and whether bandages\nare more effective at reducing oedema than compression hosiery.\nOutside continental Europe the lack of experienced therapists and\ninadequate resourcesmean that standard treatment is likely to con-\nsist of compression hosiery with advice on skin care and exercise.\nWhere MLD is not available, patients are often taught to perform\na simplified form known as \u201csimple lymph drainage\u201d (SLD) or\n\u201cself-administered massage\u201d (SAM) however as to which of these\nmethods is the more effective, and what effect they have is the\nsubject of much speculation by therapists. Pneumatic compres-\nsion therapy (PCT) used both as a way of reducing oedema and\n3Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nof controlling it, is an approach on which opinion is also divided.\nWhile PCT has been demonstrated to reduce swelling, the way\nin which it does so and the possibility of the rapid displacement\nof fluid to elsewhere in the body have caused concern. PCT does\nnot obviate the need to contain the limb with hosiery and it is\nnot clear that it provides anything which movement, whilst wear-\ning a short-stretch bandage or compression hosiery, does not also\nprovide. The role of weight control and regular exercises in the\nmanagement of lymphoedema is also thought to be important.\nO B J E C T I V E S\n1.

To assess the psycho-social benefits of physical treatment.\nM E T H O D S\nCriteria for considering studies for this review\nTypes of studies\nOnly randomised controlled trials were included in this review. If\ninsufficient details were provided as to the randomisation proce-\ndure, authors were contacted for more details. However, due to the\nlack of detail obtained in relation to the randomisation method,\nthose trials described as randomised were included in the review.\nTypes of participants\nStudies had to recruit adults (greater than 18 years of age) with a\ndiagnosis of lymphoedema defined as clinically detectable oedema\nfrom a peripheral cause of greater than three months duration.\nFollow up had to be for at least six months. In patients with uni-\nlateral oedema, the increase in limb volume of the swollen limb\nhad to be at least 10% above that of the contra-lateral normal limb\nvolume. This cut-off point was based on information regarding\nthe per cent difference in volume between left and right limbs in\nthe normal population, which can be as high as 8 to 9% (Sitzia\n1997). All types of lymphoedema were included, non cancer-re-\nlated and cancer- related. Cancer patients had to have completed\ntheir cancer treatment at least six months before entering the trial\nand could not have evidence of recurrent malignant disease when\ngoing into the trial. If multi-layer bandaging was the intervention\nbeing studied then the participants could not have already received\na course of treatment involving bandaging in the six months pre-\nceding their entry into the trial.\nTypes of interventions\n\u2022 Multi-layer bandaging compared to hosiery\n\u2022 Hosiery\/multi-layer bandaging compared to exercise\/no\ntreatment\n\u2022 Hosiery\/multi-layer bandaging compared to MLD\/\nSLD\/SAM\n\u2022 MLD compared to SLD\/SAM\n\u2022 MLD\/SLD\/SAM compared to exercise\/no treatment\n\u2022 Exercise compared to no treatment\n\u2022 PCT compared to hosiery\/Multi-layer bandaging\/SLD\/\nSAM\/exercise\n\u2022 PCT compared to no treatment\nTypes of outcome measures\nMain outcomes\n1. Volume measurement of limbs - reports of circumference mea-\nsurements alone were not sufficient unless taken at 4 cm intervals\nwhen they could be converted to volumemeasurements by the for-\nmula circumference squared over Pi. Volume could be measured\nby:\n\u2022 water displacement;\n\u2022 electronic volumeter;\n\u2022 calculated from surface measurements.\n2.Where lymphoedema was unilateral the normal limb should act\nas the patient\u2019s own control - volume had to be expressed as the\nexcess limb volume over the normal limb volume; any reduction\/\nincrease should be reported as the percentage reduction\/increase\nin the excess limb volume.\n3. Impact on quality of life.\n4. Impact on patient\u2019s sense of well-being.\n5. Impact on patient\u2019s mobility.\n6. Reduction in recurrent infections.\nAny psychological benefit such as changes in a sense of well-being\/\nquality of life or improvement in body image had to be reported\nusing validated scales. Other aspects of physical morbidity such\nas an improvement in the condition of the skin and the quality\nof the tissues in the limb, improvement in the shape of the limb\nand increased mobility had to be assessed objectively whenever\npossible. Long-term and short- term adverse effects related to the\ninterventions were noted.\nSearch methods for identification of studies\nThe Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register contains the re-\nsults of searching awide list of databases together with handsearch-\ning of specialised journals and conference proceedings. For this\nupdated version of the review, the authors decided not to continue\nto search some databases previously searched, as the trials regis-\nter is likely to contain all relevant trials. However, supplementary\n4Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Only\n30 replies were received and none of these uncovered data that\ncould be included in this review.\nData collection and analysis\nSelection\nOne reviewer scanned the titles and abstracts of the papers found\nthrough searches (CB). Those clearly not relevant based on read-\ning of the abstract (for example if it was clear that they did not de-\nscribe studies, or did not relate to lymphoedema) were excluded; if\nno abstract was available or if it was not immediately clear that the\npaper was not relevant then the full publication was retrieved for\ncloser review. A second reviewer (NP) looked at a sample of those\ndiscarded to check that nothing relevant had been lost. This pro-\ncess was independently undertaken by two reviewers in the 2008\nupdate (AL and JB) and differences resolved by consensus.\nTwo reviewers (CB and NP or AL and JB) independently read\nall the retrieved papers under consideration and independently\nassessed their eligibility for inclusion according to the criteria set\nout for trials above. An eligibility form was designed to aid the\nselection of papers and piloted before use. A third reviewer was\ndesignated to resolve any disagreement over the inclusion of any\nparticular trial.\nData extraction\nWe designed and piloted a data extraction form before use on\nthe selected papers. Data extraction was duplicated by the second\nreviewer (NP) and any disagreements resolved by the third reviewer\n(KS). Wherever possible the following data were extracted from\nthe selected studies:\n1. Details of participants including demographic characteristics,\nsource of recruitment, site of oedema, cause of oedema, duration\nof oedema, relevant co-existing medical conditions, and details of\nthe subjects\u2019 occupations.\n2. Where relevant, details of the type and treatment of any cancer,\nincluding the patient\u2019s cancer status at the time of the trial.\n3. Details of the experimental and control interventions, including\nthe length of time they were applied for and confirmation that\nCDT had not been used in the 6 months before the trial.\n4.Details relating to the homogeneity of the two treatment groups,\ne.g. the severity of oedema at the start of the trial and\/or the\nduration of oedema.\n5. The methods of assessment of limb volume and other relevant\noutcomes.\n6. Details of any financial support that might introduce a conflict\nof interest;\n7. The numbers of participants allocated to each group and the\nnumbers lost to follow-up or excluded, together with the reasons\nwhy.\nAnalysis\n5Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nNone of the studies identified compared the same intervention,\ntherefore data were not combined. We did not perform sub-group\nanalysis due to insufficient data. Analysis was by intention to treat.\nAs no studies were found comparing the same interventions, the\nresults of each study have been described in text form. Further\nstatistical analysis was not possible.\nThere were insufficient data to retrieve information on infection\nand quality of life.\nR E S U L T S\nDescription of studies\nSee:Characteristics of included studies; Characteristics of excluded\nstudies; Characteristics of ongoing studies.\nSearch results\nAs a result of the 2003 search, we identified 195 papers for possible\ninclusion. Of these, 185 were found to be ineligible on the basis\nthat they were not randomised controlled trials. Of the remain-\ning 10 studies, all were described as randomised. For one study\n(Thiadens 1999) only the abstract was available and to date the\nreview authors have been unable to obtain the full report; the de-\nsign of a trial reported in another paper (Bergan 1998) remains\nuncertain and awaits clarification. These are listed in the Studies\nAwaiting Assessment Table. Of the remaining eight studies, data\nwere only extracted from only three as the other five did not meet\nthe inclusion criteria. Reasons for their exclusion are summarised\nin the Characteristics of Excluded Studies Table.\nThe 2006 search of the specialised register identified a further\npossible 33 studies and the 2007 search identified a further possible\n21 studies. Of these, eight studies were retrieved as potentially\neligible RCTs and read in full by two reviewers (AL and SE). Two\nstudies are ongoing (Didem 2008 (this is longer follow up of one\nof the publications excluded because of short follow up); Schmitz\n2006) and are listed in the Ongoing Studies Table. Seven studies\ndid not fulfill the eligibility criteria for the review and are listed in\nthe Excluded Studies Table. The 2008 search of other electronic\ndatabases identified a further possible 477 studies. One study was\nretrieved for further inspection but was excluded as it did not meet\nthe eligibility criteria (Irdesel 2007).\nMost of the potentially relevant studies were excluded because fol-\nlow up was less than 6 months. These short term trials included 2\nstudies of pneumatic compression (Dini 1998; Johansson 1998),\nfive studies comparing MLD with various types of control (Sitzia\n2002; Williams 2002; Didem 2005; Wilburn 2006; McNeely\n2004), one study of compression plus exercise vs exercise alone (\nJohansson 2005) and one study of upper body exercise (McKenzie\n2003). Another study had six month follow up but most partic-\nipants continued with the experimental intervention, pneumatic\ncompression, after 2 months follow up (Szuba 2002). Two studies\nwere excluded because limb size was not assessed using the volume\nmeasurement (Bertelli 1991; Irdesel 2007) and one study was ex-\ncluded because only a proportion of the participants (29%) had\nlymphedema at baseline (Ahmed 2006).

A\nsummary of the participants, interventions and outcomes can be\nfound in the Table of Included Studies and are also detailed here.\nManual Lymph drainage study (MLD)\nAndersen 2000 designed a 12 month parallel group trial, with\ncrossover from the control group to the MLD group after three\nmonths, if participants felt their response was unsatisfactory.\nAll the participants were women with unilateral lymphoedema\nof the upper limb following treatment for breast cancer. Patients\nwith recurrent cancer or who were receiving treatment for lym-\nphoedema in the three months preceding the trial were excluded.\nWomen with an excess limb volume of more than 30% were ex-\ncluded and offered intensive treatment with bandages but, rather\nconfusingly, those who did not want the intensive treatment were\nallowed back into the trial. The investigators defined the mini-\nmum level of oedema for inclusion not as the percentage excess\nvolume but as an absolute excess volume of more than 200mls.\nParticipants were randomised to MLD followed by self-adminis-\ntered massage or no massage at all. TheMLD group received eight\nsessions of MLD in two weeks and training in self-massage to be\ndone daily for the remainder of the 12 month trial. Both control\nand MLD groups wore flat-knit compression sleeves daily, were\n19Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\ninstructed in exercises aimed at enhancing lymph flow and in skin\ncare and prevention of infection.\nThe main outcome was a change in the percentage excess limb\nvolume. Volume was calculated from surface measurements using\n\u201cpiecewise quadratic approximation, known as Simpson\u2019s rule of\nintegration\u201d. The authors decided on a very complex approach\nto analysis of the data on volume. The investigators also assessed\nshoulder mobility on two planes: extension-flexion and adduc-\ntion-abduction and asked patients to complete a questionnaire on\nsymptoms related to lymphoedema and the European Organisa-\ntion for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ C30)\nquestionnaire.\nHosiery Study\nHornsby 1995 investigated the use of hosiery on its own, rather\nthan in conjunction with another therapy such as MLD.\nThe study was described as a randomised trial but the method of\nrandomisation was not stated nor was the length of the trial. It\nwas of a parallel group design with two study groups.\nParticipants were recruited from patients attending a local follow-\nup breast clinic, who, if they complained of swelling in the arm,\nwere referred on to a lymphoedema clinic set up especially for the\ntrial.\nBoth groups were taught exercises, skin care and self-administered\nmassage. The experimental group were fitted with elastic compres-\nsion sleeves that were worn day and night.\nThe description of the method for assessing the main outcome,\nlimbvolume, is a little confusing. Itwould appear that limbvolume\nwas measured by water displacement in two stages, level with a\nmark 10 cms below the olecranon and then level with a mark\n15 cms above the olecranon. The normal limb volume at 15 cms\nabove the olecranon was subtracted from that of the swollen limb\nand recorded at each visit. It is not clear why two marks were\nneeded or whether the final measurement was a combined total or\nwas minus the volume up to the level of the first mark. At each visit\nparticipants were asked how much their swollen limb interfered\nwith daily activities and whether they had any pain.\nBandage Study\nBadger 2000 investigated multi-layer bandaging. The trial took\nplace in London and involved two of the authors of this review.\nThe trial was described as randomised and the method of ran-\ndomisation was reported. There were two trial groups running in\nparallel and the trial lasted six months.\nParticipants were recruited from the patients attending the lym-\nphoedema clinic and included those with unilateral lymphoedema\nof upper or lower limb, primary in origin as well as lymphoedema\nsecondary to the treatment of cancer.\nParticipants in the bandage group received a 19 day course of\nmulti-layer bandaging and were then fitted with hosiery which\nwas worn daily for the remainder of the trial. Participants in the\nhosiery alone group wore hosiery daily from the start of the trial.\nBoth groups received advice on skin care, were taught exercises\nand self-administered massage (SAM) which they were asked to\nperform daily.\nThe main outcome was reduction in excess volume that was either\ncalculated from surface measurements or measured electronically\nusing a Perometer(r). Body weight was also noted. Instances of\ninfection and venous thrombosis were noted throughout the trial.\nRisk of bias in included studies\nMethodological details of the three included studies (Andersen\n2000; Badger 2000; Hornsby 1995) can be found in the table\n\u2019Characteristics of Included Studies\u2019. These studies were also as-\nsessed for risk of bias (Higgins 2007) (see Risk of Bias tables for\neach study).\nRandomisation method\nThe method of randomisation was not described in 2 studies (\nAndersen 2000; Hornsby 1995). In the other study, random allo-\ncation was by a centralised telephone system (Badger 2000).\nAllocation concealment\nNone of the included studies provided details of allocation con-\ncealment.\nBlinding\nNone of the included studies appeared to be blinded.\nIncomplete data\nAll of the studies had withdrawals and loss to follow up after ran-\ndomisation, but in one study (Badger 2000), this proportion was\nnot considered great enough to cause major bias in the results. In\nthis study, of the 90 patients randomised, seven were excluded or\nwithdrawn, four from the bandage plus hosiery group and three\nfrom the hosiery alone group. One participant declined treatment\nwith bandages, two did not complete the course of bandaging, one\ndeveloped a recurrence of cancer, one insisted on regularMLD and\ntwonever attended for follow-up. In theAnderson study, 2\/44, one\nfrom each trial group, were withdrawn because they were found\nto be ineligible. After three months, 10 participants in the control\ngroup crossed over to the MLD group. A further five participants\nwere excluded: one died of a heart attack, two developed a recur-\nrence of cancer, one withdrew due to her husband\u2019s illness and one\nparticipant withdrew due to depression. In the Hornsby study, no\nexplicit report was given of the withdrawals or exclusions from the\n25 participants. It is clear from the data table included in the paper\nthat the number of patients in the control group had dropped by\nabout half by the third visit (6\/11 remained) and by the fourth\nonly one participant remained. No reasons were provided for this\nreduction in numbers. In the treatment group, follow up went on\nfor eight visits but there was a steady falling off of participants\nfrom the third visit. Out of 14 participants at the start of the trial,\ndata are available for only three by the end; again no reasons are\n20Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\nput forward for this reduction in numbers.\nSelective outcome reporting\nNone of the included studies provided details of their study pro-\ntocols, so selective outcome reporting cannot be excluded.\nOther bias\nOne study (Hornsby 1995) did not provide details of the compa-\nrability of randomised groups at baseline. For the other 2 studies,\nthere was no evidence of a difference in prognostic factors at base-\nline.\nEffects of interventions\nManual Lymph Drainage Study (Andersen 2000)\nOf the 42 participants included in the analysis 22were randomised\nto MLD + hosiery and 20 to hosiery alone. Other than endocrine\ntherapy, received by 10 participants in the hosiery alone group and\nonly two in the MLD group, the groups were evenly balanced in\nother respects such as age, duration of oedema, at the start of the\ntrial.\nThe median excess volume at the start of the trial is reported as\nthe absolute volume rather than as a percentage so it is difficult\nto judge how bad the participants\u2019 oedema was. By the end of the\ntrial, the mean percentage reduction in excess limb volume was\n60% (95% CI 43 to 78%) in the hosiery alone group as against\n48% (95% CI 32 to 65%) in the MLD group. This difference\nwas not significant. No differences were found between the two\ngroups in the symptom scores.\nThe authors concluded that improvements seen in both groups\nwere attributable to the use of compression sleeves and that MLD\nprovided no extra benefit at any point during the trial.\nHosiery Study (Hornsby 1995)\nThere are problems with the reporting of this trial. From the text,\nit seems that the data in the tables represent the difference between\nswollen and normal limb volume at each visit. The raw data for\neach participant are tabulated but no means, standard deviations\nor confidence intervals are calculated. It is possible to work out the\npercentage reduction in excess limb volumes for each participant\nfrom these data. But the drop out rate is so high, particularly in\nthe control group, that little information is available beyond the\nsecond month in the treated group and beyond the first month in\nthe control group. Data concerning pain and how much swelling\ninterfered with daily activities are not reported in any detail and\nnot according to trial group.\nThe author concluded that, although this was a small study, the\nresults suggest that wearing a compression sleeve is beneficial and\nthat the high dropout rate in the control groups may have reflected\nthe subjects\u2019 lack of progress.\nBandage Study (Badger 2000)\nData were available for analysis on 83 participants, 34 in the ban-\ndage + hosiery group and 49 in the hosiery alone group. Around\ntwo thirds of participants had upper limb oedema and most were\nfemale. There was a satisfactory balance between the groups in\nterms of age, duration of oedema, site, gender, body weight and\nexcess volume at the start.\nBoth groups achieved a reduction in percentage of excess limb\nvolume but that achieved by the bandage + hosiery group was\nconsistently greater than that of the hosiery alone group. On day\n19, marking the end of the course of bandaging, the bandage +\nhosiery group achieved a mean reduction of 33.5% (SD 16.9)\nas against 9.6% (SD 20.4) in the hosiery alone group. Progress\nat week 12 was maintained at week 24 in both groups but that\nachieved by the bandage + hosiery group (mean 32.6% SD 33.2)\nwas almost double that of the hosiery alone group (19.6% SD\n28.5).\nThe authors concluded that in this mixed group of patients ban-\ndage + hosiery resulted in a greater reduction in excess limb volume\nthan hosiery alone and this difference in reduction was maintained\nlong-term.\nD I S C U S S I O N\nAny oedema of the surface tissues that involves a fluid component\nis likely to be influenced by the application of external pressure, as\nclinical experience world-wide has demonstrated over many years.\nFrom a physiological point of view, difficulties are likely to arise\nif fluid is trapped in fatty tissues (since fat absorbs pressure) or in\nfibrotic tissues where it becomes difficult for fluid to be displaced.\nBoth of these scenarios are common in lymphoedema but despite\nthese problems few therapists specialising in the management of\nlymphoedema doubt that improvements can be obtained through\ntreatment. The question is not so much \u2019can lymphoedema be\ntreated?\u2019 but rather \u2019what treatments reduce swelling, and themor-\nbidity associated with swelling, most effectively?\u2019 In addition to\nthis question, we need to ask \u2019what treatments produce lasting\nimprovements?\u2019 since short-term improvements satisfy no one.\nIt appears that at present there is no drug or surgery that will re-\nduce chronic oedema and allow the reduction to be maintained.\nPhysical therapies remain the most commonly used treatments\nfor lymphoedema and are usually combined in a treatment pro-\ngramme, since the general view is that no one treatment is likely to\nbe successful on its own. The difficulty lies in establishing which\nof these physical treatments plays themost critical part in reducing\nand controlling swelling and which, if any, can be safely left out\nof the treatment programme.\nThis systematic review extends the findings of earlier non-\nCochrane systematic reviews of physical therapies for lym-\nphoedema (Harris 2001; Kligman 2004; Moseley 2007). All re-\nviews were limited by the lack of adequately designed randomised\ncontrolled trials. Most of the studies conducted so far in this field\nare either designed poorly or are poorly reported. Most are too\nsmall and provide too little follow-up to be of any use. There is\na tendency to concentrate on one section of the lymphoedema\n21Physical therapies for reducing and controlling lymphoedema of the limbs (Review)\nCopyright \u00a9 2008 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\npopulation (i.e. breast cancer patients) when the growing body\nof evidence on prevalence and incidence suggests that lower limb\noedema, either of primary origin or secondary to cancer and other\nconditions, is also a significant problem.\nOur objective in this review was to assess the impact of physical\ntreatment programmes on the volume, shape, condition and long-\nterm control of oedema in lymphoedematous limbs and in addi-\ntion to establish the psycho-social benefits of physical treatment.\nWe were not able to answer any questions relating to the effect\nof treatment on the incidence of infection. While it is accepted\nthat assessing the effect of treatment on the patients\u2019 psycho-social\nwell-being presents considerable challenges there is a significant\nbody of literature on this subject, particularly in relation to other\nchronic conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, that\ncould be drawn upon. The few studies included in this review offer\nlittle to increase our understanding in this area.\nA U T H O R S \u2019 C O N C L U S I O N S\nImplications for practice\nOf the three trials included here, only one studied lower as well\nas upper limb oedema. All three trials have their limitations and\nhave yet to be replicated, so their results must be viewed with\ncaution. There is weak evidence to support the use of multi-layer\nbandaging over hosiery alone.\nImplications for research\nThere is a clear and pressing need for well-designed, randomised\ntrials of the whole range of physical therapies if the best approach\nto managing lymphoedema is to be determined. Trials of complex\nphysical therapy programmes, while not easy to conduct, are nev-\nertheless possible.\nA C K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nOur thanks go to the members of the editorial office of the\nCochrane Breast Cancer Group for assisting in all stages of the\nreview and especially to Sharon Parker (Review Group Coordina-\ntor) and Nicole Holcroft and Joanne Talenta (Trials Search Coor-\ndinator).\nThanks are also expressed to the study investigators who provided\nadditional information and were generally helpful.\nWe acknowledge the contribution of Anne Lethaby and Julie\nBrown (Cochrane updating project) for the 2008 update.\nR E F E R E N C E S\nReferences to studies included in this review\nAndersen 2000 {published data only}\n\u2217 Andersen L, Hojris I, Erlandsen M, Andersen J.
