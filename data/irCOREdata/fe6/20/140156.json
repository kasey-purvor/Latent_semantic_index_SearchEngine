The use of fibre grating refractometers as a means of monitoring the cure of a UV-\ncured epoxy resin is presented. The wavelength shift of the attenuation bands of a long period\ngrating and the spectral response of a tilted fibre Bragg grating sensor were measured\nsimultaneously during the cure of the resin and compared with measurements made using a\nfibre optic Fresnel based refractometer. The results showed a good correlation (6 x 10-3 rius)\nand illustrate the potential of the techniques for non-invasive composite material cure\nmonitoring.\n1. Introduction\nMany fibre optic techniques have been reported for the in-situ monitoring of the cure of epoxy resins\n[1]. They offer clear advantages over traditional monitoring techniques, arising from their inherently\nsmall dimensions and high sensitivity. Spectroscopic methods predominantly use the fibre as a means\nfor delivering the light to and from a sample [1]. However, direct interaction of the propagating mode\nwith the surrounding environment has also been reported, achieved by etching or side polishing the\noptical fibre to remove the cladding and thus expose the evanescent tail of the core mode field [2]. For\napplications requiring embedding of the optical fibre, such as the monitoring of the cure of composite\nmaterials, techniques that do not require removal of the fibre cladding are attractive. In-fibre grating\nstructures are capable of coupling light from the core of the fibre into the cladding, where the\ninteraction of the cladding modes with the external environment enables the measurement of the\nsurrounding refractive index without the need for etching or side polishing of the fibre. Two in-fibre\ngrating structures which act as core to cladding mode couplers are considered here, the long period\ngrating (LPG) and the tilted fibre Bragg grating (TFBG). An LPG produces a discrete set of\nattenuation bands in the transmission spectrum of the optical fibre [3]. The refractive index sensitivity\nof LPGs has been exploited for a range of applications, including, chemical concentration sensing [4],\nliquid level sensing [5] and as a means of forming a tuneable spectral filter [6]. A TFBG produces\nnumerous resonances in the transmission spectrum of the optical fibre, the monitoring of which has\nbeen used to demonstrate a refractometer [7], again without the requirement for etching, side polishing\n[8] or tapering [9] the fibre.\n1.1. Long Period Gratings\nA long period grating (LPG) consists of a periodic modulation of the refractive index of the core of an\noptical fibre. The period of the modulation is typically in the range 10 \uf06dm to 1000 \uf06dm, and promotes\ncoupling between co-propagating modes of the optical fibre. In the case of single mode fibre, the\ncoupling takes place between the guided mode and co-propagating cladding modes. Efficient coupling\nis possible to only a subset of these cladding modes [3]. As the cladding modes are poorly guided and\nsuffer from high attenuation, the transmission spectrum of an optical fibre containing an LPG contains\na number of attenuation bands, each corresponding to coupling to a different cladding mode. The\nphase matching wavelengths are governed by the expression [10],\n\uf028 \uf029 \uf028 \uf029\uf05b \uf05d\uf04c\uf02d\uf03d \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c i cleffncoeffni __ ( 1 )\nwhere \uf06ci, neff_co, nieff_cl and \uf04c\uf020 are the ith cladding mode resonance wavelength, effective index of the\ncore, effective index of the ith cladding mode, and the grating period respectively. The refractive index\nsensitivity of LPGs arises from the dependence of the coupling wavelength upon the effective index of\nthe cladding mode. The response of an LPG to refractive index is manifested as a shift in the central\nwavelength of the attenuation bands; this is shown in figure 1. The higher order modes show an\nincreased sensitivity, and this is enhanced as the refractive index approaches that of the cladding.\nWhen the refractive index matches that of the cladding, the cladding modes are no longer supported as\nthe cladding appears to be of infinite thickness. Further increase of the refractive index leads to the\nbands reappearing, corresponding to the existence of leaky modes, but at a longer wavelength and with\nsignificantly reduced refractive index sensitivity [10].\n1.38 1.40 1.42 1.44 1.46 1.48 1.50 1.52 1.54 1.56 1.58 1.60 1.62\n-30\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\nW\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh\nSh\nift\n(n\nm\n)\nR.I.\n-30.0\n-25.0\n-20.0\n-15.0\n-10.0\n-5.0\n0.0\n5.0\n1.38 1.42 1.46 1.50 1.54 1.58 1.62\nIndex of refraction\nW\nav\nel\nen\ngt\nh\nsh\nift\n(n\nm\n)\nFigure 1.

The refractive index at the wavelength of operation was\ncalculated using the Sellmeier equation. The wavelength response was then fitted with a 6th order\npolynomial to provide a function relating wavelength shift to refractive index.\n1.2. Tilted Fibre Bragg Gratings\nA standard fibre Bragg grating (FBG) consists of a refractive index modulation in the core of an\noptical fibre that acts to couple the fundamental forward propagating mode to the contra-propagating\ncore mode. A tilted FBG (TFBG) [11,12] consists of a refractive index modulation that is purposely\ntilted or blazed relative to the fibre axis in order to enhance coupling between the forward-propagating\ncore mode and contra-propagating cladding modes, as illustrated in figure 2. The contra-propagating\ncladding modes are poorly guided and attenuate rapidly and are therefore not observable in reflection\nbut are observed as numerous resonant bands in the transmission spectrum of the TFBG. A typical\ntransmission spectrum is shown in figure 3.\n\u03b8\nCladding\nmode\n\u039bB \u039b\nCore\nCladding\nFigure 2.

The dotted line indicates the position of the\nBragg wavelength. The shaded area illustrates the envelope technique used for area calculation.\nThe TFBG spectral resonances are more complex and require a different method of analysis\ncompared to that of the LPG. One method by which this may be achieved is by constructing an\nenvelope that completely surrounds the spectral resonances [7]. The area that is enclosed by the\nenvelope varies with changes in the refractive index of the surrounding environment. By monitoring\nthis change and relating it to the refractive index it is possible to use the TFBG as a refractometer. The\nTFBG response to changes in surrounding refractive index, shown in figure 4, was characterised by\nimmersing the section of fibre containing the TFBG in a series of Cargille refractive index oils of\ndiffering refractive index. The refractive index at the wavelength of operation was calculated using the\nSellmeier equation The wavelength response was then fitted with a 3rd order polynomial to generate a\nfunction relating wavelength shift to refractive index.\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.385 1.395 1.405 1.415 1.425 1.435 1.445\nIndex of refraction\nN\nor\nm\nal\nis\ned\nar\nea\nFigure 4. Normalised area of the envelope of the TFBG resonances (with reference to that when the\nTFBG is in air) plotted as a function of the refractive index of the surrounding medium.\nIn this paper, the use of LPGs and TFBGs as resin cure monitoring sensors is investigated. The\nindex of refraction of a polymerising resin changes as the molecular density increases and as the\natomic bonds involved in the polymerisation processes are altered [13]. The sensitivities of TFBGs\nand LPGs to changes in refractive index are exploited with the aim of developing a method of\nmeasuring the degree of cure. To aid cross comparison of results, a Fresnel reflection based\nrefractometer has been designed and implemented [14].\n2. Experiment.\nA TFBG of length 5mm and blaze angle 4.5\u00b0 was fabricated in boron-germanium co-doped optical\nfibre, Fibercore PS1250 with a cut-off wavelength of 1240 nm, using the near-field interference\npattern of a tilted phase-mask. The photosensitivity of the fibre was enhanced by pressurizing it in\nhydrogen for a period of 2 weeks at a pressure of 150 bar at room temperature. The phase mask was\nilluminated with a UV beam at a wavelength of 248nm and with an average power of 40 mW. The\nTFBG was interrogated by coupling the output from a super-luminescent diode of bandwidth 60 nm\ninto the optical fibre, and monitoring the transmission using a scanning fibre Fabry-Perot\ninterferometer of free spectral range 43 nm and of finesse 900 [15].\nTo investigate the LPG response to the refractive index change of the resin at different\nwavelengths, LPGs of length 40mm and 400\u00b5m period were fabricated in two different fibre types,\none with a cut off wavelength of 650nm (Fibercore SM750) and the other with a cut off of 1275nm\n(Optical Fibres 1310). The fibre was photosensitised by pressurising it in hydrogen for a period of 2\nweeks at a pressure of 150 bar at room temperature. The fibre was then placed behind an amplitude\nmask that was illuminated by a UV laser beam at a wavelength of 266nm, provided by an injection-\nseeded frequency-quadrupled Nd:YAG laser.\nThe transmission spectrum of the fibre with the shorter cut-off wavelength, shown in figure 5, was\nmonitored by coupling the output from a tungsten-halogen white light source into the fibre and\ncoupling the transmitted light to a CCD spectrometer (Ocean Optics S2000) with a resolution of\n0.3nm. The transmission spectrum of the fibre with the longer cut-off wavelength was monitored using\nan Advantest Q8381 spectrum analyser with a resolution of 0.1nm.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n840 880 920 960 1000 1040 1080\nWavelength (nm)\nT\nra\nns\nm\nis\nsi\non\n(%\n)\nFigure 5. Transmission spectrum of an LPG of length 40mm and of period of 400\u03bcm, fabricated in an\noptical fibre with a cut-off wavelength of 650nm (Fibercore SM750).\nThe responses of the fibre grating based refractometers to the refractive index change were\ncompared with refractive index measurements made using a Fresnel based refractometer [14]. Two\nFresnel refractometers were constructed, operating at wavelengths of 833nm and 1575nm. This was to\naid correlation with the wavelength regions used by the fibre gratings and to reduce the differences\nintroduced by the dispersion of the resin. The Fresnel approach is complementary to the grating\nsensors in offering a highly localised measurement of the refractive index change at the end of a fibre\nthat can be readily calibrated, as described below. However, this approach is not as appropriate for\napplications where multiplexing of several sensors is required, or where a longer gauge length sensor\nis necessary.\n2.1. Fresnel Refractometer\nThe experimental configuration is shown in figure 6. The output from a laser diode operating at the\nappropriate wavelength was intensity modulated at a frequency of 270Hz, and coupled into a network\nof 3dB directional couplers. The Fresnel reflection from the fibre\/resin interface was monitored using\nphotodiode pd1. In the second arm, photodiode pd2 monitored the reflection from the air\/fibre\ninterface, acting as an intensity reference to aid the normalisation of the signal and to account for any\nchange in power coupled into the optical fibre from the laser diode. The outputs from the photodiodes\nwere monitored using lock-in amplifiers. To minimize any contributions from unwanted Fresnel\nreflections from the unused port of the 3dB coupler, micro bends were induced in the fibre to form a\nhigh attenuation return path for the reflections.\nThe refractive index determined using the refractometer is given by [14]\n1\n_\n1\nRn neff co\nR\n\uf044\uf02d\n\uf03d \uf0b4 \uf044\uf02b\n( 3 )\n_\n_\nn neff co a\nn neff co a\n\uf02d\n\uf044 \uf03d \uf02b ( 4 )\nepoxyV\nairVR \uf03d ( 5 )\nwhere, neff_co is the effective refractive index of the fibre mode, na is the refractive index of air given as\n1.0002739 [14], Vair is the voltage produced by photodiode pd2, obtained for the reflection from the\nfibre\/air interface and Vepoxy is the voltage produced by photodiode pd1, corresponding to the reflection\nfrom the fibre\/resin interface.\nA UV cured epoxy resin, EpoTek OG134, with an uncured refractive index of 1.4163, measured at\n589nm [17], was used as the test resin. A UV lamp, with output power 4W and with a spectral peak at\n365nm, was positioned to provide a fluence of 6.57mW\/cm2 in order to cure the resin slowly and to\nallow the reaction to be recorded using the relatively low sampling rate achievable using the OSA. The\nLPG and TFBG spectra and the reflection signal from the Fresnel probe were recorded at 0.5s\nintervals during the cure.\nResults\nFigure 7 shows the refractive index of the curing resin measured by both of the Fresnel based\nrefractometers (solid line - 833nm and dashed line - 1575nm). The datum is the time at which the UV\nlamp is switched on. At this time a clear decrease in refractive index was observed. This is due to an\nexothermic reaction initiated by the incident UV light. The temperature of the resin was measured with\na thermocouple, placed in the resin, which indicated a 6.5\u00b0C increase in temperature over the first 5\nminutes. It was also noted that there was an ambient temperature increase. This was measured with a\nthermocouple placed close to the sample. The thermocouple measurements are shown in figure 8.\nThe measurements indicating the evolution of the refractive index made at the two wavelengths show\ngood agreement. After the initial decrease in the refractive index, a rapid increase is measured,\nindicating the reaction process. The rate of change of refractive index reduces after 90 minutes. The\ndifference between the measurements made at the two wavelengths may be due to the dispersion of the\nresin.\nFigure 6.

Temperature of the OG-134 epoxy resin measured during cure by two K-type\nthermocouples; one placed in the sample (solid) and the second placed close to the sample (dashed).\nAn exothermic peak is evident shortly after the UV lamp was turned on.\nTo aid comparison of the LPG\u2019s response to the resin during cure, a simple model was used. The\nmodel uses the Gloge weakly guiding approximation [18] to calculate the effective refractive index of\nthe core mode. The standard dispersion equation for a step index fibre [19] was used to calculate the\neffective indices of the cladding modes. The central wavelengths of the attenuation bands may then be\ndetermined using equation (1). The refractive index measured during the cure of the resin using the\nFresnel system was then input to the model to calculate the corresponding change in the cladding\nmode effective index, and thus allow prediction of the change in the LPG attenuation band\nwavelength. Figure 9 shows the prediction of the central wavelength of the longest wavelength (5th)\nattenuation band of an LPG fabricated in an optical fibre with a cut-off wavelength of 650nm, of\nlength 40mm and with a 400\uf06dm period. Shown here also is the actual response of the longest\nwavelength band of an LPG fabricated in the lower cut-off fibre (Fibercore SM750) of length 40mm\nand with a period of 400\uf06dm. The close agreement with the model shows the potential for using an\nLPG as a cure monitoring sensor. The contributions of strain and temperature to the measured\nwavelength shift are not included in the simplified model. Transverse strain is known to develop\nduring the cure for some resin systems [20], but has not yet been determined for the UV resin used\nhere.\n-2.50\n-2.00\n-1.50\n-1.00\n-0.50\n0.00\n0.50\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nTime (mins)\nW\nav\nel\nng\nth\nsh\nift\n(n\nm\n)\nFigure 9.

Figure 10 shows the refractive index calculated using the fifth attenuation\nbands of both LPGs (SM750 and OF1310 fibre). At both wavelengths the initial decrease in refractive\nindex, observed when the UV lamp is switched on, is followed by a rapid positive change in refractive\nindex. As exhibited by the Fresnel refractometer, the LPGs show a decrease in the rate of change of\nrefractive index after 90 minutes. The discrepancies may again be attributed to dispersion effects and\nto errors induced in the calibration, where the thermo-optic change in refractive index of the resin was\nassumed to be negligible. The results obtained using both the Fresnel technique and the LPG based\nmethod indicates that the onset of the positive refractive index change is delayed when the\nmeasurement is made at the longer wavelength. This may point to the dispersive properties of the\nresin. The refractive index of the resin at the shorter wavelengths (~800nm) approaches the high\nsensitivity regions of the refractometers before that of the longer wavelengths (~1550nm).\n1.400\n1.405\n1.410\n1.415\n1.420\n1.425\n1.430\n1.435\n1.440\n1.445\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nTime (mins)\nIn\nde\nx\nof\nre\nfr\nac\ntio\nn\nFigure 10.

The\nrefractive index starts to increase 5 minutes after the UV lamp is switch on. The TFBG sensor\nindicates a refractive index of 1.437 when the resin is fully cured, achieved after 180 minutes. This\nagrees, to within 5 x 10-4 rius (refractive index units), with the measurement from the Fresnel\nrefractometer operating at 1575nm. The calibration discussed in section 1.2 revealed that the\nsensitivity of the TFBG decreases rapidly for refractive indices greater than 1.43, and it is apparent\nthat the response curve starts to flatten after 60 minutes as the TFBG starts to lose sensitivity. All three\nsensor types show that most of the reaction takes place in the first 90 minutes, after which there is a\ngradual reduction in the rate of change of refractive index. The reaction is almost complete after 2\nhours.\nThe performances of the different techniques are summarised in table 3. The discrepancy between\nresults obtained using the Fresnel and grating based refractometers may be attributed to the\ntemperature and strain sensitivities of the LPG and TFBG sensors, as mentioned previously. The\nthermo-optic effect may also have an influence on the resonant wavelength, equations (1) and (2). This\neffect is negligible for the Fresnel technique. Investigation into the influence of these effects is the\nsubject of current work.\nTable 3.

The core-cladding mode coupling resonances of a tilted fibre Bragg\ngrating (TFBG) and of an LPG have been shown to be sensitive to the cure of an epoxy resin. The\nmeasurements made using the grating refractometers were compared with those made using a fibre\noptic Fresnel reflection based technique, and were found to be in agreement to within 6 x 10-4 rius.\nThe grating based refractometers are sensitive to temperature and strain, which must be decoupled to\naccurately measure refractive index. These techniques may be used with cure-kinetic models to\ncharacterise and monitor the cure of resins and fibre reinforced resin systems [20].\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support for this work from the Engineering and Physical\nSciences Research Council (EPSRC), UK.\nReferences\n[1] Degamber B and Fernando G F 2002 Process monitoring of fiber-reinforced polymer\ncomposites MRS Bulletin 27 370-80\n1.400\n1.405\n1.410\n1.415\n1.420\n1.425\n1.430\n1.435\n1.440\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nTime (mins)\nIn\nde\nx\nof\nre\nfr\nac\ntio\nn\nFigure 11.
