As this suggests, the notion that theory of any kind matters is contested, \nperhaps particularly in environments where there is a sense of urgency about political \nand social change. Precisely elaborated theoretical distinctions that threaten to make \nno practical difference can seem as pointless as those apocryphal debates about the \nnumber of angels that can dance on a pin-head; and when one\u2019s mind is trained on \nissues of violence, poverty, or discrimination, it is hard to avoid impatience with those \nwho airily leave questions of feasibility to another day. The complaint often levelled \nat \u2018theory\u2019 is that it fails to engage with the complexities of the real world.  But at \nleast with \u2018theory\u2019 the failure may be inadvertent: the theorist may have thought \nherself saying something highly pertinent, but in the eyes of her critics has failed.  \nWith ideal theory, the charge sheet will be considerably longer, for ideal theory does \nnot just fail, incidentally, to address real world complexities; it actively chooses to set \nthese to one side.  \nMy concern in this paper is with an aspect of liberal egalitarian thought that \nmight be regarded as proof against such criticism, a development that could be \nrecommended, to the contrary, for its realism. This is the now almost universal \nacceptance that a plausible conception of an egalitarian society must accommodate \nitself to the existence of markets in goods and labour. Grand treatises on justice or \nequality that nowhere mention money, markets, or capitalism present us with an \nalmost insurmountable task of translation; while condemnations of the market as \n                                                 \n1 My thanks to Ciaran Driver, Marc Fleurbaey, Ingrid Robeyns, Adam Swift and an anonymous reader \nfor their comments on an earlier draft. \n 2\nsimply immoral and unjust immediately beg \u2013 and have commonly ducked - the \nquestion of what, then, we are supposed to do. It would be hard to find examples of \neither such approach in the current literature. With the demise of communism (in both \ntheory and practice), and widespread recognition that any foreseeable future will \ninvolve some version of a market economy, even egalitarians have accommodated \nthemselves to this.2 A significant number go further, deploying the virtues of the ideal \nmarket in their condemnation of its often corrupt realities.   \nThough I share the concern with feasibility, I am troubled by this turn towards \nthe market; and especially troubled by the claim that there are sound egalitarian \nreasons for endorsing markets in goods and labour. Endorsements in the name of \nefficiency already risk invoking an idealised version of \u2018the market\u2019 that bears little \nrelationship to the often failing markets of the real world. Endorsements in the name \nof equality mostly make it clear that it is market as ideal type, not as actual practice, \nthat is said to promote equality. Yet here, too, the idealising move risks blunting the \ncritique of actual market operations, because of the difficulties in disentangling ideal \nfrom real. Features from the operations of actual markets may be mistakenly \nincorporated into descriptions of the ideal, in ways that pre-empt more radical \nalternatives; or substantive norms associated with market societies may be written in \nto what are presented as neutral market \u2018mechanisms\u2019. From the other side, persistent \nfeatures of actual markets may be treated as anomalies or irrelevant corruptions, in a \nmanner that recalls distinctions between \u2018explaining\u2019 and \u2018explaining away\u2019.3 My \nsuspicion, in other words, is that it is not so much the egalitarian accommodation with \nmarkets that is the source of my unease, but the fact that this accommodation so often \noperates through ideal theory.  \nIn what follows, I start with some illustrations of the turn towards the market \nin liberal egalitarian political thought, and go on to distinguish three distinct meanings \nthat can be attached to the notion of ideal theory.4 I have deliberately broadened the \n                                                 \n2 Alex Callinicos (2000) Equality, Polity Press, is one valiant exception, but even he describes his \nalternative as \u2018outside the bounds of contemporary common sense\u2019 and  requiring a \u2018revival in utopian \nimagination\u2019 (132-3). \n3 In his critique of contract theory, Charles Mills is particularly scathing of a tendency to represent \nracial injustice as an anomaly, and the \u2018unhelpful and ultimately evasive abstracting away from \nquestions of race\u2019. Mills (2007) \u2018Contract of Breach: Repairing the Racial Contract\u2019: 108, in Carole \nPateman and Charles W Mills Contract and Domination Cambridge, Polity Press.  \n4 I focus in this paper on liberal egalitarian thought, and do not address the further literature on market \nsocialism. Had I done so, I suspect I would have found a richer and more contextualised understanding \nof markets.  \n 3\nterm beyond its reference point in John Rawls\u2019 distinction between ideal and non-\nideal theory, for I see the over-emphasis on Rawls\u2019 definition as itself an unhelpful \nnarrowing of debate. Within each of the three meanings, I consider ways in which the \ndeployment of ideal theory creates problems in theorising the relationship between \nequality and the market. My own view, to state it from the outset, is that differences \nbetween one kind of market society and another are going to become increasingly \nimportant in the development of egalitarian alternatives, and that questions about the \ncompatibility of equality with the market will come to focus more on the substance of \nmarket relations than a general principle of market exchange. Specificity matters here. \nMarkets in what? how \u2018free\u2019 is the market? how regulated? What kinds of power \nhierarchies are established in what kinds of market in goods or labour? Which of \nthese, if any, is compatible with principles of equality? Certain idealised ways of \ntalking about \u2018the market\u2019 are unlikely to help in answering such questions.  \n \nModes of market accommodation \nOne dominant mode of market accommodation follows a pattern laid out by Rawls, \nwhere the theorising is self-consciously ideal, and the market enters as an (also \nidealised) \u2018fact\u2019 of life that imposes efficiency constraints on distribution. The \npresumption, derived from ideal considerations, is in favour of an equal distribution of \nsocial primary goods, but this is to be modified where an unequal distribution turns \nout to the advantage of the least advantaged. The modification is itself justified in \nideal terms (as what any rational person would choose), but its reference point is \nclearly market society, including what is taken to be the historically established \nrelationship between competitive markets and economic growth, and the need for both \nprofit and income differentials. Rawls himself explicitly assumes a free market \nsystem, while remaining agnostic on the precise role of private ownership.5 In doing \nso, he moves between an idealised version of the market (which \u2018may then be used to \nappraise existing arrangements\u20196), and more historically contingent discussion of the \nrelative merits of private property versus socialist regimes. He accepts entirely the \nefficiency claims made on behalf of a free market system, and regards it as one of the \nstrengths of the difference principle that it makes justice compatible with efficiency.  \n                                                 \n5 \u2018I assume in all interpretations\u2026that the economy is roughly a free market system, although the \nmeans of production may or may not be privately owned.\u2019 John Rawls (1971) A Theory of Justice: 66 \n6 Rawls:272 \n 4\nClaims about market efficiency are not my primary focus, but it can already be \nsaid that this idealises the market in misleading rather than useful ways. Rawls\u2019 \ndeployment of an ideal is, of course, entirely deliberate, but his movement between \nidealised conception and historical actualisation is by no means precise, particularly \nwhen the ideal involves claims about historical tendencies. Consider, for example, \nhow he deals with objections that the difference principle permits the most extreme \ndisparities in income and wealth so long as the least fortunate receive just the slightest \noverall benefit: in his illustration, an extra billion dollars to the best off justified by \nanother penny to the least advantaged.7 This is not, he argues, to be regarded as a real \nworry, because the just society will also enjoy equal liberties and positions open to all, \nand the widening opportunities associated with this will exert pressure on inequalities \nto keep them within acceptable bounds. \u2018In a competitive economy (with or without \nprivate ownership) with an open class system excessive inequalities will not be the \nrule. Given the distribution of natural assets and the laws of motivation, great \ndisparities will not long exist.\u20198  Yet this is surely a claim about the actual workings \nof actual market societies, to be tested against historical evidence, not deduced from \nthe concepts themselves.  Rawls here fleshes out his ideal market with what might be \nthought an over-optimistic reading of how actual markets operate. \nIt can also be said that Rawls\u2019 account of efficiency falsely represents the need \nfor incentives as integral to the workings of a free market, in ways that then place \nthem beyond the scope of justice. In his famous criticism, G A Cohen likens the \nrefusal of the talented to work for anything like the average wage to a kidnapper \ndemanding ransom, and argues that it would be hard to sustain the incentive \njustification for inequality if the rich had to make their case for it when face-to-face \nwith the poor.9 It is not, in this analysis, an \u2018objective fact\u2019 about markets that the \ntalented have to be paid more, but something that derives from their own \nunwillingness, and Cohen argues that there would not be the same \u2018need\u2019 for \nincentives if the culture shifted in a more just and egalitarian direction. I take it as one \nimplication of this that those who represent the need for incentives as definitionally \nintegral to \u2018the market\u2019 have engaged in false idealisation.  In doing so, they commit \n                                                 \n7 Rawls: 157 \n8 Rawls: 158 \n9 GA Cohen  (1992) \u2018Incentives, Inequality and Community\u2019 in G.B Petersen (ed) The Tanner Lectures \non Human Values, Vol  XIII Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press \n 5\nus to more constrained and unequal consequences than the endorsement of markets as \nuseful co-coordinating mechanisms need imply. \nA second line of argument, initiated by Michael Walzer, represents the market \nas relatively unproblematic in the way it regulates the distribution of money and \ncommodities, but seriously out of place once allowed to influence the distribution of \nsuch matters as education or sex or health. \u2018The merchant panders to our desires. But \nso long as he isn\u2019t selling people or votes or political influence, so long as he hasn\u2019t \ncornered the market in wheat in a time of drought, so long as his cars aren\u2019t death \ntraps, his shirts inflammable, this is a harmless pandering\u2026the exchange is in \nprinciple a relation of mutual benefit; and neither the money that the merchant makes, \nnor the accumulation of things by this or that consumer, poses any threat to complex \nequality \u2013 not if the sphere of money and commodities is properly bounded.\u201910 The \nissue, for Walzer, is not whether the market as such is compatible with equality (it \nisn\u2019t, strictly, but it does what it does well). The problem is that \u2018money seeps across \nall boundaries\u201911, and the challenge for egalitarians is therefore to keep it in its place.  \nSome of the feminist writing on prostitution or contracts for surrogate \nmotherhood has followed a similar train of thought, taking issue not with the market \nper se as with the appropriateness of markets in women\u2019s sexual or reproductive \nlabour.12 In her critique of commercial surrogacy, for example, Elizabeth Anderson \navoids the suggestion that the norms of the market are in principle unattractive or anti-\negalitarian, but focuses on where these norms legitimately apply. \u2019To say that \nsomething is properly regarded as a commodity is to claim that the norms of the \nmarket are appropriate for regulating its production, exchange and enjoyment\u201913: this \nsuggests nothing particularly disreputable in market norms. The problem, for \nAnderson, arises when these are applied to the way we allocate and understand \nparental rights and responsibilities or the way we treat women\u2019s reproductive labour, \nfor when this happens, \u2018children are reduced from objects of love to objects of use\u2019 \nand women \u2018from subjects of respect and consideration to objects of use\u2019.14  \n                                                 \n10 Michael Walzer (1983) Spheres of Justice: A Defence of Pluralism and Equality Blackwell:110 \n11 Walzer:22 \n12 For example, Debra Satz  (1992) \u2018Markets in Women\u2019s Reproductive Labor\u2019 Philosophy and Public \nAffairs 21: 107-31, and (1995) \u2018Markets in Women\u2019s Sexual Labor\u2019 Ethics 106: 63-85 \n13 Elizabeth Anderson (1990) \u2018Is Women\u2019s Labor a Commodity?\u2019 Philosophy and Public Affairs,14: \n72.  \n14 Anderson: 92.  \n 6\nWalzer\u2019s approach is commonly regarded as the antithesis of ideal theory: he \ndescribes himself as \u2018radically particularist\u2019, grounding his normative claims in the \nshared meanings of existing societies, and standing \u2018in the cave, in the city, on the \nground\u2019.15 Anderson also represents herself as a contextual theorist, more in tune with \nthe classical economist\u2019s understanding of the norms and institutions that constitute \nmarket society than the radical abstractions of their neo-classical successors.16 This \nparticular mode of market accommodation is unlikely, then, to provide the best \nillustration for my thesis, but I include it as further evidence of the sustained turn \ntowards the market in liberal egalitarian thought.  \nA third mode of market accommodation fits more closely with my thesis, and \nis particularly associated with Ronald Dworkin. Writing in 1981, Dworkin noted that \nthe market was widely perceived as the friend of efficiency and freedom but the \nenemy of equality.17 Egalitarians, by implication, had to balance out these competing \nconcerns (perhaps \u2013 though he did not say this \u2013 along the lines suggested by Rawls). \nAgainst this, Dworkin endorsed the hypothetical market as an actively equalising \nforce, arguing that \u2018the idea of an economic market, as a device for setting prices for a \nvast variety of goods and services, must be at the center of any attractive theoretical \ndevelopment of equality of resources\u2019.18  (This means, incidentally, that he is willing \nto see it applied in areas such as the provision of health, where Walzer would regard it \nas inappropriate.) Dworkin was not endorsing the actual operations of actual markets \n\u2013 far from it - but he drew on explicitly idealised models of the market, like the \nclamshell auction or hypothetical insurance market, to tease out the implications of \nequality of resources.   \nIn many ways, indeed, Dworkin\u2019s use of an idealised market is more central to \nhis arguments than the choice\/circumstance distinction that subsequently became so \n                                                 \n15 Walzer: xiv \n16 Elizabeth Anderson (2004) \u2018Ethical Assumptions in Economic Theory: Some Lessons from the \nHistory of Credit and Bankruptcy\u2019 Ethical Theory and Moral Practice 7; see also (1993) Value in \nEthics and in Economics  Cambridge, Mass.  Harvard University Press. \n17 Ronald Dworkin (1981) \u2018What is Equality? Part 1 Equality of Welfare\u2019 Philosophy and Public \nAffairs, 10\/3; (1981) \u2018What is Equality? Part 2 Equality of Resources\u2019 Philosophy and Public Affairs, \n10\/4 These are reprinted virtually unchanged in Sovereign Virtue, so page references for quotes are \nfrom the later book.  \n18 Ronald Dworkin (2000) Sovereign Virtue: The Theory and Practice of Equality Harvard University \nPress: 66 \n 7\nmuch associated with his work.19 He sees the market as an invaluable mechanism \nrevealing to us the \u2018true\u2019 costs of our preferences, for it is through the market that we \ncan work out what kind of burden our choices about our lives place on others.  The \nmarket (this is still the hypothetical, not the corrupted real one) delivers us the \nnecessary combination of equality and respect for diversity, for with everything up for \nsale, at prices that reflect only what people are willing to pay, what each of us ends up \nwith will be the unique combination of goods and services we really want. What is \nmore, none of us will be making unreasonable \u2013 inequitable- demands on the others in \ngetting it. In the hypothetical insurance market, for example, Dworkin imagines what \nthe average person would be willing to pay to insure against the catastrophe of poor \nhealth or limited talent \u2013 how much risk she would be willing to bear, how much \npotential income she would be willing to set aside as protection \u2013 and uses this to \ntease out the true costs of preferences. If we were to ask people what they thought \n\u2018society\u2019 or some unspecified other person should pay to protect them against \nmisfortune, we might get very different answers. It is through focusing attention on \nwhat people are willing to pay themselves that we can get at their \u2018real\u2019 preferences. \nAt the heart of Dworkin\u2019s understanding of equality is the notion that \u2018people \nshould pay the price of the life they have decided to lead, measured in what others \ngive up in order that they can do so (my emphasis)\u2019.20  The market provides the \nmechanism for assessing what the social resources devoted to any one of us actually \ncosts by measuring what these resources are worth to others. It also provides us with \nthe best possible device for avoiding paternalism, perfectionism, arbitrariness, or just \nthe disdain of those who do not happen to share our values. As Dworkin puts it, \n\u2018respect for the personal judgments of need and value that citizens have actually \nmade, or would be likely to make under appropriate conditions\u2019, in exercising \nresponsibility for their own lives, is central to the hypothetical insurance market \nstrategy. This makes it \u2019the very opposite of paternalistic\u2019.21\nTo achieve all this, of course, \u2018the market\u2019 has to be very unlike the real \nmarkets we see all around us: most importantly, it has to be something we enter on \n(reasonably) equal terms. The clamshell auction on the desert island would have no \ncredibility as a model of equality if the immigrants had struggled ashore with different \n                                                 \n19 Dworkin himself did not initially use this distinction: it was Cohen who identified it as a defining \ntheme in his work. GA Cohen (1989) \u2018On the Currency of Egalitarian Justice\u2019 Ethics, 99  \n20 Dworkin Sovereign Virtue: 74 \n21 Dworkin: 319 \n 8\namounts of money or stolen from one another. \u2018We must not lose sight of that \nfact\u2026in any reflections on the applications of that argument to contemporary \neconomic systems. But neither should we lose sight, in our dismay over the inequities \nof those systems, of the important theoretical connection between the market and the \nconcept of equality of resources.\u201922  The object, at this stage, is \u2018the design of an \nideal, and of a device to picture that ideal and test its coherence, completeness, and \nappeal.\u201923 The market enters in what Dworkin describes as a positive but servile way: \npositive, because the model enables us to measure opportunity costs; but to be \nabandoned or constrained when analysis shows that actual markets have failed in this \ntask.24  \nInterestingly, Elizabeth Anderson also represents markets as actively \nequalising, though in an argument that stresses real, historical, markets rather than a \nhypothetical one. Anderson\u2019s argument revolves around the way markets are \nembedded in particular laws of contract and generate movements for particular kinds \nof state regulation, and her argument is better understood as making a case for the \nvirtues of particular forms of capitalism rather than the market per se.  Following the \nclassical rather than neo-classical economists, she argues that a market-based \neconomy is the only credible basis for a society of equals, because it dispenses with \nservile relationships. \u2018Capitalism, by enabling ordinary people to make a living \nwithout depending on noblesse oblige, thereby transformed the moral economy of \nsocial standing to a more egalitarian and potentially universalizable footing.\u2019 25 Or in \nthe famous quote from Adam Smith, \u2018It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, \nthe brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own \ninterest\u201926.  \nWhen Smith said this, he was not only celebrating the co-ordinating force of \nself-interest. He was also pointing to the contrast with what he described as the \n\u2018servile and fawning\u2019 way people used to have to ingratiate themselves with those \nthey wished to do them a service. In a market society, we do not have to placate \nothers; we just have to have the money. When we buy a good or  service, we are \nprimarily concerned with what it costs and whether it meets our needs, and will not \n                                                 \n22 Dworkin Sovereign Virtue: 70 \n23 Sovereign Virtue: 73 \n24 Sovereign Virtue: 112 \n25 Elizabeth Anderson (2004) \u2018Ethical Assumptions in Economic Theory: Some Lessons from the \nHistory of Credit and Bankruptcy\u2019 Ethical Theory and Moral Practice 7:352 \n26 Adam Smith The Wealth of Nations Book 1, Chapter 2 \n 9\n(in principle) give a moment\u2019s thought to who is selling it. When we decide which \ncandidates to select for a particular job, we are primarily concerned with who can best \ncarry out the work, and will not, in principle, give a damn about whether the \ncandidates are male or female, black or white, recent migrants or from the oldest \nfamily in town. The very impersonality and anonymity of the market (what some \ncritics have objected to under the rubric of alienation) is said to make it indifferent to \ndistinctions of gender, race, or social status. In her endorsement of this, Anderson is \nclear that markets cannot embody relations of equality when people lack equality in \nbargaining power, and her vision of market society is one where everyone is secured \nagainst destitution, and there are laws protecting the rights of tenants against \nlandlords, guaranteeing workers their right to organise into unions, preventing the rich \nfrom abusing their wealth to establish social hierarchies, and so on. As already noted, \nshe also thinks the market must be kept firmly in its place, and is opposed to markets \nin women\u2019s reproductive labour or markets in sex.  But like Dworkin, she regards the \nmarket as an important force for equality -  not so much, in her case, for teasing out \nwhat people really want or are prepared to pay, but in undermining relations of \nservility.27\nThese are big claims, but insofar as they are claims about markets as ideal \ntypes it becomes almost impossible to assess them. Even with Anderson\u2019s more \ncontextualised understanding of markets and capitalism, there is no easy way in which \nthe realities of contemporary market society can be brought to bear in assessing the \nvalidity of the theoretical claims. Mountains of evidence about the inequalities and \nfavouritism of existing markets will not of themselves prove the case, for these can \nalways be taken as showing that the equalising powers of the market have not yet \nbeen fully unleashed. (This is part of what I mean when I say that arguments about the \nmarket and equality lend themselves to a tendency not so much to \u2018explain\u2019 as to \n\u2018explain away\u2019.) The idea that market relations corrode older prejudices, for example, \nhas to have something going for it: it cannot be total coincidence that the last fifty \nyears has witnessed the greatest world-wide incorporation of women into the labour \nmarket and one of the most revolutionary periods yet as regards gender relations. Yet \nmarkets everywhere continue to be characterised by systemic differentiation by \n                                                 \n27 See also David Miller (1989)  Market, State and Community: Theoretical Foundations of Market \nSocialism Oxford, Clarendon Press.  for an endorsement of the anonymity and impersonality of the \nmarket. \n 10\ngender and race. Are we to attribute this to the presence or the absence of markets, to \ntheir dominance or incomplete development? Since what is at stake is never pure \nmarket versus pure non-market (neither of which exists), it becomes almost \nimpossible to determine whether the many contra-indications reflect the continuing \nstrength of non-market forces or the absurdity of the notion that markets promote \nequality.  \nIn an earlier paper assessing claims \u2013 in this case, mostly by non-egalitarians - \nabout markets eroding partiality and promoting toleration, Iain Hampsher-Monk noted \nthat one of the difficulties in challenging such views was that no amount of empirical \nevidence about the persistence of discrimination was going to be recognised as \ndecisive. \u2018The market ideologue is apt to respond to apparent instances of the free \nmarket\u2019s failure to realize its predicted virtues with the observation that the world \nmust be falling short of the demanding characteristics of the ideal market and should \nbe rearranged forthwith.\u2019 28 That the real world falls short may be regarded as a \nparochial irrelevance, for it is the \u2018perfect market\u2019, the \u2018market as ideal type\u2019, on \nwhose behalf the claims are being made. Hampsher-Monk has a particularly ingenious \nresponse to this that I shall come back to later, but for the moment it is the general \npoint that matters. Simply countering claims made on behalf of an ideal market with \nevidence of the deficiencies of actual markets will be derided as failing to understand \nthe role of abstraction. When applied to egalitarian theorists who employ the \nhypothetical market precisely so as to highlight the imperfections of actual ones, it \nwill be seen as entirely missing the point.  \nIn what follows, I do not directly address claims about markets promoting \nequality (though it will no doubt be apparent that I am sceptical of such claims). My \nquestion, rather, is whether the turn towards the market exemplifies one or more of \nwhat I distinguish as three idealising moves. If so, can it be said to illustrate some of \nthe problems with those moves?  \n \n1. The critique of abstraction  \nThough we owe much of the current language of ideal and non-ideal theory to Rawls, \nI start with a different literature (one that has been more formative for me) that centres \non the abstractions of the citizen or individual. This is primarily a feminist literature -  \n                                                 \n28 Iain Hampsher-Monk (1991) \u2018The Market for Toleration: a Case Study in an Aspect of the \nAmbiguity of \u201cPositive Economics\u201d\u2019 British Journal of Political Science, vol 21: 30 \n 11\nthough we can trace an interesting line from Carole Pateman\u2019s Sexual Contract to \nCharles Mills\u2019 Racial Contract and on to Mills\u2019 contribution to the critique of ideal \ntheory.29 The main argument here is that the abstraction fails in its proclaimed \nneutrality. The figure of the white male lurks behind the innocently depicted citizen, \nexcluding or marginalising the racialised and gendered other. \nIn its origins, the abstract citizen or individual was entirely deliberate, and \nmostly well-intentioned. It was through differentiating what was essential from what \nwas contingent that liberals and egalitarians were able to propose that we ignore \nsocial differences of wealth and status, overlook biological differences of ability and \nstrength, and focus on what makes us all human, therefore deserving of equal respect. \nBut the representation of the individual, not just as disembedded (the communitarian \ncritique) but also as disembodied (the feminist critique) meant that features \nhistorically specific to particular groups of individuals got tangled up in the supposed \nabstraction. Most notably, the individual was conceptualised in the image of the male: \nthe evidence for this, paradoxically, being precisely the extent to which the male body \ndisappears from view. The male body becomes invisible as the taken-for-granted \nnorm, while the female body (what Nirmal Puwar describes as the body out of \nplace30) carries a burden of doubt, is associated with difficulties and problems, is \nthought to require \u2018special\u2019 treatment or concessions, and generally lacks authority. \nBy the same token, those who constitute the dominant group have no racial or ethnic \ncharacteristics \u2013they are able to figure simply as \u2018individuals\u2019 \u2013 while the racial \ncharacteristics of the rest become hyper-visible.  \nThat this has happened is easy enough to establish: we need only trawl \nthrough classic texts in liberal and egalitarian theory. The more challenging claim is \nthat it is impossible to construct disembodied conceptions of the individual without \nintroducing some kind of hierarchy, or some version of an us\/ them differentiation. \nThe claim here is that we cannot consistently think outside the constraints of lived, \nembodied, experience, and that somewhere along the line, particular kinds of bodies \nand particular kinds of people are going to enter into even the most abstract of \nconceptions. In any given society, there may be some abstractions we can genuinely \n                                                 \n29 Carole Pateman (1988) The Sexual Contract Cambridge: Polity Press; Charles W Mills (1997) The \nRacial Contract Ithaca: Cornell University Press; Charles W. Mills (2005) \u2018\u201dIdeal Theory\u201d as \nIdeology\u2019 Hypatia, 20.3: 165-184. For a discussion of the relationship between their ideas, see also \nPateman and Mills ( 2007) Contract and Domination Cambridge: Polity Press.  \n30 Nirmal Puwar (2004) Space Invaders: Race, Gender,and Bodies Out of Place Berg. \n 12\nmanage: it might be, for example, that in a society where nothing at all attached to \nwhether people believed in god or which god they believed in, we could construct an \nimage of the citizen that in no way privileged one religious group over another. It \nmight be (I find this even harder to imagine) that in some future world where nothing \nattached to gender, we would be able to talk of the rights of the individual or roles of \nthe citizen without in any way conjuring up either a male or female norm. The notion, \nhowever, that we can achieve the necessary distance simply by the act of abstraction - \nsimply through the power of thought - is almost certainly mistaken. We live our lives \nas embodied individuals, and cannot so readily separate out mind from body.  \n How might this kind of argument link to the idealisations and abstractions of \nthe market? This is not, remember, a question about whether actual markets \ncorrespond to what is offered as the hypothetical or ideal: as in the parallel of the \nabstract individual or citizen, the whole point of the abstraction is that it isn\u2019t intended \nto correspond. Nor is it even a question about whether some contingent aspect of \nexisting markets has been mistakenly attached to the depictions of the ideal. If that \nwere the issue, the feminist critique of the abstract individual would simply be that \nliberals talked of the individual but in practice really meant white men; or talked of \nthe individual but in practice meant heads of household. That has of course been \nsaid,31 but if that were all, it would be open to liberals to dismiss this as the bad old \nhistory of the tradition, and one that today\u2019s liberals can put behind them. By \nextension, it would be open to theorists of the market to apologise for slipping in \nspecific aspects of particular markets when they talked of the virtues of the market, \nand promise to do better next time. The question is not whether actual markets \ncorrespond to the ideal type (clearly, they don\u2019t). The deeper question is whether, \neven in the most abstract formulations of \u2018the market\u2019, certain kinds of norms creep \nin.  \nIn the \u2018pure\u2019 model of economic theory \u2013 taken over, I would suggest, in much \nof the Rawlsian deployment of the market - this is not supposed to happen. Prices, for \nexample, are not supposed to reflect the costs of production, and certainly not the \nintrinsic (or worse still, moral) value of a commodity, but simply the current \nequilibrium between supply and demand. There is no \u2018right\u2019 price. As Hayek put it, \n\u2018current prices\u2026 have no necessary relation to what has been done in the past in order \n                                                 \n31 For example, in Susan Moller Okin\u2019s critique of Rawls in Justice, Gender and the Family Basic \nBooks, 1989. \n 13\nto bring the current supply of any particular good on the market\u2019,32  for however \nmuch effort it took to produce a particular commodity, the good becomes worthless if \nno-one now wants it.  If preferences change and demand collapses, so too will the \nmarket value. If demand rises without a corresponding increase in supply, so too will \nthe price. Norms of fairness are not supposed to play any role in this.  \nBut just as it is hard to imagine an individual without that individual assuming \nembodied form, so it is hard to conceive of market transactions taking place \nunmediated in any way by norms, codes, social conventions or expectations.33 \nGeoffrey Hodgson defines the market \u2018as a set of social institutions in which a large \nnumber of commodity exchanges of a specific type regularly take place, and are to \nsome extent are facilitated and structured by those institutions.\u201934 In this \nunderstanding of the market \u2013 considerably more plausible than the abstractions of the \npure model - the social institutions and conventions, which will vary through time, \ncannot be separated from what makes market transactions work. Prices, including \nprices for labour, are not established in a vacuum. In particular, people will have prior \nnotions as to what is a reasonable price for a particular good or service, or a \nreasonable wage for a particular job; and as feminists have commonly argued, this \nlatter will often incorporate historically generated norms about men\u2019s and women\u2019s \nwork.35 Employers will commonly take account of prevailing norms in setting rates \nfor a job, and suppliers will commonly take account of them in setting prices for \nservices or goods. Representing these socially generated ideas of worth as external to \nthe operations of the market \u2013 perhaps as historical contingencies, or leftovers from \nsome pre-market past \u2013 simply presumes in advance that we can sensibly talk of a \n\u2018pure\u2019 market untouched by these. \nIn \u2018Economists Favour the Price System \u2013 Who Else Does?\u2019, Bruno Frey \ndiscusses the example of a Toronto hardware store that raised the price for snow \nshovels from $15 to $20 after a heavy snow storm, and was roundly condemned by \nToronto residents who regarded this as \u2018unfair\u2019 practice.36  In the idealised market, \nraising prices is an entirely appropriate response to a shortage in supply. This sends \nout signals to hardware stores in other towns that it might now be worth their while to \n                                                 \n32 F A Hayek Law, Legislation and Liberty: a new statement of the liberal principles of justice and \npolitical economy (Routledge 1993 edition,) 116 \n33 This is also part of Anderson\u2019s argument. \n34 Geoffrey Hodgson  (1988) Economics and Institutions Polity: 174 \n35 For example, Anne Phillips and Barbara Taylor(1980) \u2018Sex and Skill\u2019 Feminist Review  6: 79-88  \n36 Bruno S Frey (1986) \u2018Economists Favour the Price System \u2013 Who Else Does?\u2019 Kyklos 39\/4: 545 \n 14\nship in some of their own snow shovels; sends out messages to poorer consumers that \nthey might now be better off making their own shovels; and generally brings about a \nnew equilibrium of supply and demand at a new price. In reality, however, norms of \nfairness may constrain what suppliers will do. They may fear losing the good will of \ntheir customers if they engage in what is seen as sharp practice, and may not raise \nprices every time there is a shortage even if the result is that customers have to queue \nand that some of those willing to buy at a higher price go without. Norms of fairness, \nincluding norms of what people do or do not deserve for their work, play a part in \nestablishing prices even within market systems. If so, the question of what these \nnorms are \u2013 and whether they are legitimate \u2013 remains a central issue. \nThe further point raised by Hampsher- Monk is that the neutrality claim often \nmade on behalf of markets may be incoherent, because markets must either presume \nor else promote particular norms. If prices do not reflect intrinsic value, but are simply \nthe outcome of myriad consumer preferences, this clearly means there is no such thing \nas a \u2018natural\u2019 price. In principle, any commodity can attract any price, and it all comes \ndown to the relationship between consumer preferences and what is currently \navailable for sale. But in that case, he argues, there is no reason to rule out people \npaying a premium for their prejudices \u2013employers paying more to have men working \nfor them rather than women, for example, or shoppers paying more to buy their goods \nfrom white sales assistants rather than black. More precisely, the only reason why this \ncould not happen would be if the preference for maximising one\u2019s money holdings \nalways wins out over what we might term a preference for discrimination. Yet if we \nthink of the preference for maximising money holdings and the preference for \ndiscrimination just as two different preferences \u2013 as the market model, with its \nsupposed lack of interest in the nature of preferences, would seem to suggest \u2013 it is \nnot obvious that we can assume that everyone wants the first. \u2018If it turned out to be \nempirically demonstrable that paradigmatically free markets did, as a matter of fact, \nerode discriminatory\u2026 preferences while sustaining narrowly \u2018economic\u2019 ones, this \nwould, ironically, disprove the claim that the market mediated neutrally between \nparticipants\u2019 preference schedules.\u2019 37 Either the ideal type of the market assumes that \nwe will prefer money to our prejudices (in which case it has imported a substantive \n                                                 \n37 Hampsher-Monk: 42 \n 15\nnorm).Or actual markets actively encourage us to do so (in which case they cannot be \nneutral and agnostic between preferences).  \nBoth Rawls and Dworkin rule out the impact of prejudice \u2013 Rawls through a \nprinciple of fair equality of opportunity, Dworkin through a principle of independence \nthat rules out auction bids that fail to treat members of the community with equal \nconcern \u2013 so my point here is not that either lacks the intellectual resources to \nchallenge discrimination. The point, rather, is that markets cannot be conceived as \nneutral devices generating principles of equitable treatment when they operate \nthrough historically specific conventions and norms that may or may not (and this \nthen becomes a historical, not conceptual question) promote equality. The relevance \nof this should become clear in my final section.  \n \n2. Rawls\u2019 contrast between ideal and non-ideal theory \nIn the figures of the individual and citizen, or the abstraction of the market as \ndiscussed above, the abstraction is not intended to carry any normative implications. It \nis \u2018ideal\u2019 simply in the sense of being an ideal type, supposedly stripped of \ncontingency and accident. In Rawls\u2019 formulation, by contrast, ideal theory refers \nsimultaneously to an abstraction from reality and to what is normatively ideal. Ideal \ntheory is said to provide us with the principles of justice or morality appropriate to a \nworld in which institutions and individuals already comply with the obligations of \njustice or morality. It deals, that is, with the principles of justice in a well-ordered \nsociety where \u2018everyone is presumed to act justly and to do his part in upholding just \ninstitutions\u2019.38  \nThe plausible object of this idealisation is to abstract from the effects of \ninequitable institutions or the problem of \u2018bad\u2019 people so as to focus our minds on \nwhat justice requires. So we would not, for example, ask what counts as a fair \nuniversity admissions policy in a world marked by major inequalities of wealth (that \nbeing a problem for non-ideal theory), but would assume that the economic system \nwas just, and focus on what ought in this context to be the procedures governing \nuniversity admissions. We would not ask whether it was fair to require people to tell \nthe truth when everyone around them is an expert in deception, but would work out \nthe rules governing truth-telling on the assumption that everyone was complying with \n                                                 \n38 John Rawls A Theory of Justice: 8 \n 16\nthem. Rawls sometimes talks as if non-ideal theory is about the principles we need to \ndeal with injustice (comprising \u2018the theory of punishments, the doctrine of just war, \nthe justification of the various ways of opposing unjust regimes\u201939) as if the spheres of \nideal and non-ideal theory refer to entirely different domains. At other points \u2013 more \nhelpfully, in my view - he represents non-ideal theory as dealing with the adjustments \nwe have to make to ideal theory when faced with \u2018natural limitations and historical \ncontingencies\u2019.40  \nRawls is somewhat opaque in explaining how ideal theory then informs non-\nideal, but we can derive a useful illustration from Cecile Fabre\u2019s investigation of what \nrights individuals have as regards the provision of bodily services, and whether it is \npermissible to sell body parts. Fabre begins from what she describes as ideal theory: \u2018I \nassume that individuals\u2019 needs for material resources are already met, so that no one \nlacks, through no fault of their own, access to housing, minimum income, or the kind \nof health care which does not necessitate body parts.\u201941 The point of this abstraction is \nto help us work out exactly what it is we object to when we object to certain kinds of \nbodily transactions. If we were judging the acceptability of organ sales in the context \nof the \u2018real\u2019 world, where some people are so impoverished that they risk death to sell \nkidneys to rich invalids, and where the trade in body parts involves fraud, \nmanipulation of the most vulnerable, and organised crime, we might conclude \u2013but \nperhaps too readily - that the sale of body parts is morally indefensible. The \nabstractions of ideal theory enable us to work out whether our objections lie in those \nfacts of global inequality, or in more contestable claims about the integrity of the \nperson being bound up in the integrity of the body, or people not having the right to \ndispose of their bodies as they wish. The abstraction asks us to set to one side, for \nlater consideration, all those objections that stem from the imperfections of \ncontemporary society.  \nThis looks helpful as a way of clarifying intuitions about justice, and I would \nnot want to rule it out as a useful theoretical device. But it begs the question (asked by \nother contributors to this issue) of whether the intuitions formed under the assumption \nof compliance can provide a useful guide to the dilemmas that face us in the non-\ncompliant world. Those defending ideal theory recognise, of course, that we may have \n                                                 \n39 ibid \n40 Rawls: 246.  \n41 Cecile Fabre (2006) Whose Body is it Anyway? Oxford University Press:8 \n 17\nto modify the initial principles once we add in the facts of non-compliance. We might, \nfor example, decide to ban the sale of body parts, even if we have concluded that \nindividuals have a moral right to buy and sell, because of the risks of encouraging \nwhat is currently an unscrupulous trade. The issue is not whether ideal theory can ever \nmake itself more realistic, can ever move beyond the first stage. The question is \nwhether this way of setting things up \u2013first check out the moral intuitions under \nconditions of abstraction, then see if other considerations alter the picture \u2013 already \nrigs the outcome in a particular way.42  \nIn discussions of the market, economists very commonly make a Rawlsian \n\u2019ideal theory\u2019 manoeuvre when they discuss the appropriateness of the price \nmechanism in such matters as reducing congestion on the roads or cutting carbon \nemissions. They assume, most notably, that the distribution of incomes is equal. They \ntake the complications of income inequality out of the picture - in Rawlsian language, \nthey assume compliance - and then consider the advantages of rationing through the \nprice system against the risks of rationing through direct regulation. Under the \nassumption of equal incomes, the price mechanism always wins. It turns out to be \nfairer, more effective, better for the environment, better for everyone, to impose, say, \na congestion charge on all cars entering a crowded city than to ration entry according \nto registration numbers, or increase subsidies on public transport, or build more roads. \nTo put a Dworkinian gloss this, those who really appreciate the privacy and \nconvenience of a car, will be prepared to pay the premium, while those who attach \nmore value to other things will happily travel by bus; neither envies the other\u2019s choice \nand  there are fewer cars on the road.  \nThe worried social critic then points out that incomes are not equal, and that \ncongestion charges effectively deny access to motorists on low incomes while making \nthe drive into the city a more delightful experience for those who can afford to pay. In \nmy experience, the economist typically replies that this is a separate or subsequent \nmatter, to be dealt with by some compensatory policy for the poorest, or through \nredistributive taxation. The point to note is that it is very rare for the complications \nattached to an unequal distribution of income to lead to serious reconsideration of the \n                                                 \n42 Charles Mills argues, plausibly to my view, that adding racial injustice in at a second stage of a \ntheory of justice is likely severely to skew the analysis. \u2018For when racial oppression has been central \nrather than marginal \u2013 as has obviously been the case in the United States \u2013 it is absurd to utilize \nwithout modification a conceptual apparatus that presupposes race-neutral inclusion, color-blind \nuniversalism, and egalitarian political input as the actual dominant norms\u2019.

If so, it looks as if the initial abstraction is \nnot just simplifying the picture in order to clarify the issues at stake. It is loading the \ndice in favour of a particular solution.  \nIn political, as opposed to economic theory, the tendency has mostly been in \nthe opposite direction, with the market model abandoned or overridden at the point \nwhere its implications conflict with other moral intuitions. This makes it a lot more \npalatable \u2013 but leaves one wondering just how useful the hypothetical model has been. \nConsider Dworkin\u2019s application of the hypothetical insurance model to health care. \nHe makes three idealising assumptions: that the resources people can command are as \nnearly equal as possible; that everyone has state-of-the-art knowledge about the costs \nand side-effects of particular medical procedures; and that no-one has access to \ninformation about the susceptibility of particular individuals to particular diseases. \nWith these assumptions in place, the market model is supposed to aid collective \ndecision making about medical expenditure by modelling what choices prudent \nindividuals would make if they knew they had to carry the costs of their choices \nthemselves. Dworkin argues, for example, that very high levels of medical \nexpenditure in the US reflect the fact that most decisions about the purchase of health \ncare are made by patients and doctors, while the costs are borne by insurance \ncompanies, \u2018so that those who make the decisions have no direct incentive to save \nmoney\u2019.43 The object of the market model \u2013 and this is familiar terrain from neo-\nclassical economics - is to promote decisions that more genuinely reflect \u2018what people \nwould decide to spend on their own medical care, as individuals, if they were buying \ninsurance under fair free-market conditions\u2019.44\n       In his discussion of this, Lesley Jacobs has argued that it is impossible to say that \nhealth care decisions should reflect what well informed people, carrying the real costs \nof their preferences, would choose and that there should be universal access to health \ncare.45 The implication of the first, he suggests, is that even health benefits ought to \nbe paid in convertible cash, and once that happens, it will no longer be possible to \nmaintain a universal health service. There seem no good grounds, for example, for \nrefusing the AIDS patient who says he prefers to take certain resources in cash rather \nthan see the money spent on expensive medical equipment that might only marginally \n                                                 \n43 Dworkin:310 \n44 Dworkin:317 \n45 Lesley A Jacobs (2004)\u2019Justice in Health Care: Can Dworkin Justify Universal Access?\u2019 in J Burley \n(ed) Dworkin and his Critics Blackwell \n 19\nprolong his life. There therefore seems no basis on which a Dworkinian egalitarian \ncan insist that all sick people have access to health care. Dworkin replies (reasonably \nenough) that a government committed to equality of resources can still constrain \nchoices in some circumstances, and can legitimately decide that health insurance \nshould be mandatory, not therefore exchangeable for cash. Apart from paternalistic \nreasons \u2013 which he does not rule out - sick citizens are expensive, and \u2018particularly \nexpensive to a community of decent people who will not let the indigent die or suffer \nfor lack of medical care\u2019.46  \nI share Dworkin\u2019s substantive position on this, but it seems to me that his \nresponse still leaves Jacobs essentially right. If one of the justifications for the market \nmodel is that it respects our personal judgments on what something is worth to us, it \nshould in principle take its even-handedness all the way down. If even a broadly anti-\npaternalist like Dworkin is unwilling to pursue this to its conclusion, preferring to \noverride the strict market model at the point where it conflicts with other moral \nintuitions (like those of a \u2018community of decent people\u2019), then the hypothetical market \nis doing less of the normative work than was originally proclaimed. Unlike their \nlibertarian counterparts, liberal egalitarians do not back themselves into indefensible \npositions through their deployment of the market model. They typically stop short of \nthis, either stressing the enormous gap between their idealising assumptions and \ncurrent realities, or \u2013 as seems to be happening in this instance - drawing on some \nadditional moral intuition that justifies a departure from market norms. That they stop \nshort of unpalatable conclusions is part of what confirms them as egalitarians. The \nworry, then, is not so much that endorsement of the market model commits liberal \negalitarians to more inequalities than they desired or intended, for they always have a \nget-out clause when that point is reached. The worry is that endorsement of the \nmarket model may blind them to more radical alternatives.  \nThis is where an earlier point about needing to focus more on the substance of \nmarket relations rather than just general principles of market exchange becomes \nespecially pertinent. There has been a lot of discussion in recent years about the \nnarrow distributional paradigm of much contemporary egalitarianism: the tendency to \ntheorise equality as a fair distribution of things, rather than as equality in \n                                                 \n46 Dworkin Sovereign Justice: 361 \n 20\nrelationships.47  One of the strengths of the alternative \u2018relational\u2019 approach is that it \ndirects attention to the substance of market relations, focusing on the power \nhierarchies involved in particular wage contracts or the social disrespect involved in \nparticular consumer relations, and arguing that these are as important in the \ndelineation of an egalitarian society as the distribution of material resources.  In the \nmore abstract endorsements of \u2018the market\u2019, the nature of social relations, including \nwhether they involve hierarchies of power, is less to the fore. While the average \nliberal egalitarian will readily abandon the market model when it leads to what she \nregards as unacceptable inequalities in distribution, she may not be so quick to notice \nunacceptable hierarchies of power or respect.   \n \n3 Ideal theory and the fact\/value distinction \nThere is a third, looser, notion of ideal theory that comes into play when people say \nwe need to work out the ideals of justice or equality \u2013the dreams of paradise -  before \ntesting these against considerations of feasibility. The argument here is not that \nsustaining a clear distinction between ideal and non-ideal helps clarify the grounds of \nour intuitions about justice, but that starting from the constraints of the non-ideal \nworld can so much lessen our ambitions that we end up commending only some \nmildly improved version of the status quo. John Roemer, for one, argues \u2018that one \nmust know what the ethically desirable policy is before compromising for the sake of \npolitical reality. Let us not mix ethics and political pragmatism, but rather remain \nclear on the distinction between what is right and what compromises are necessary, \nbecause our societies have not yet embraced what is right.\u201948 Cohen, too, argues for a \nclear distinction between the demands of equality and justice, and perceptions of what \nis politically feasible. He acknowledges, after all, that incentives are necessary to \nmotivate higher levels of production, and it might be said that if he accepts that \nnecessity for incentives, then his critique of their moral grounding is a bit beside the \npoint. But it is important for Cohen not to mis-describe a compromise with the \n                                                 \n47 Including: Iris Marion Young (1990) Justice and the Politics of Difference, Princeton University \nPress; Elizabeth S Anderson (1999) \u2018What is the Point of Equality?\u2019 Ethics 109\/2:287-337; Samuel \nScheffler (2003) \u2018What is Egalitarianism?\u2019 Philosophy and Public Affairs 31\/1: 5-39; John Baker, \nKathleen Lynch, Sara Cantillon, Judy Walsh (2004) Equality: From Theory to Action.

Anyone who lived through the heady decades of \nthe 1960s and 70s will be aware of a radical curtailment of egalitarian and democratic \nambitions that has occurred since that period. Questions of feasibility have pushed \nconsiderations of justice off the agenda, and worries about appearing foolishly utopian \nhave supplanted worries about not being radical enough. Previously significant \ndiscourses on the role of utopias in stretching the imagination and breaking the \nconfines of hegemonic thought have fallen out of fashion, and the range of considered \nalternatives has very significantly narrowed. With this closure of possibilities in mind, \nthere seems good reason to promote more ideal theory, not less. When considering the \nfirst two meanings attached to ideal theory, I suggested that its deployment could \nencourage too much tolerance of market pricing or market models. In this third \nmeaning, ideal theory is designed precisely to challenge that tendency by pushing \nquestions of feasibility (including questions of market efficiency) into second place. It \nwould then be entirely coherent to challenge the first two versions of ideal theory \nwhile wholeheartedly embracing the third.  \nYet when applied to the market, there are also problems here, for the \nseparation between ideal and delivery can encourage a fact\/value distinction that \nreinforces notions of the market as a relatively neutral tool. This, in a sense, has been \nthe strategy of post Rawlsian egalitarians, who recommend leaving the market to do \nits work in generating the wealth, while drawing on ideal theory to identify the \nappropriate principles for taxation and redistribution. This is a clear implication of the \nnow widespread compensation discourse, for compensation is usually understood as \nsomething that occurs after the event, and is therefore separated in time as well as \nconceptually from the process of wealth generation. It also tends to be the message of \nthe alternative discourse of equality of opportunity, for example in Roemer\u2019s work, \nwhere the object of criticism is not so much the market system of rewarding \noccupations (which may simply reflect laws of supply and demand), but the tendency \nto reward certain types of people differently even when they have put in identical \n                                                 \n49 Cohen \u2018Incentives, Inequality and Community\u2019: 329 \n 22\namounts of effort.50 For Roemer, the equalising adjustments are better timed before \nthe event than after, for example, through hefty public spending on the education of \nthose social groups whose efforts still leave them clustering in the ranks of the \nunemployed or lowest paid. But whether the language is of compensation or equality \nof opportunity, there is a tendency to separate out the norms that should regulate \ndistribution and\/or re-distribution from the practicalities that supposedly govern \nproduction. \nWhether we can usefully separate out the principles that regulate production \nfrom those that regulate distribution has long been an issue in Marxist debate; and is \npart of what is currently at issue in arguments between distributional and relational \nconceptions of equality. The other main worry is that the separation understates the \nimpact that living in a market society has on norms of fairness or equality, and \npresumes too readily that it is possible to pick out the \u2018good\u2019 elements of a market \nsociety while discarding or modifying the \u2018bad\u2019. If the market is not, as I have \nsuggested, simply an organising tool with semi-miraculous qualities of efficiency, but \na set of institutions and conventions that embody their own norms, this \u2018pick and \nchoose\u2019 approach to the market may not be so readily available.  \nMarkets are only able to operate because of the codes and conventions that \ninform and regulate market behaviour. These conventions are not amoral, but likely, \non the contrary, to involve particular norms, including particular understandings of \ndesert. If so, then one of the major difficulties in welding strong conceptions of \nequality onto a market system of pricing and rewards is that markets may encourage \nprecisely those notions of personal entitlement that egalitarians have been trying to \nchallenge over the last three decades. In particular, the very experience of living in a \nmarket society may make the average citizen cling more firmly than ever to the notion \nthat she does indeed deserve what she gets on the market. And the more we hear \nabout the supposed fairness or neutrality of the market, the more convinced we may \nbecome that what falls into our lap by virtue of a relatively untrammelled market is, \nfairly, ours. \nI do not mean, by this, that people living in market-dominated societies \nbecome incapable of formulating any criticism of the inequalities they see around \nthem: this is patently not the case. People very commonly espouse moderate through \n                                                 \n50 John Roemer Equality of Opportunity \n 23\nto radical notions of equality of opportunity. They commonly think it unfair when two \npeople who have worked equally hard end up with very different earning potential, \njust because one was fortunate enough to be sent to a well resourced private school \nand the other grew up on a sink estate. To this extent, they share with contemporary \nliberal egalitarians the perception that people should not suffer because of their bad \nluck; though they tend to be more tolerant of the idea that people can benefit from \ngood luck, and less convinced than the typical post-Rawlsian egalitarian of the \nunfairness of one person being born more talented than another. It is evident, \nmoreover, that many people living in market-dominated societies regard the \nextraordinary recent payments to top executives as illegitimate,51 which suggests \nconsiderable resistance to market principles of reward. Yet when we consider this last, \nit seems more likely that criticisms of company executives arise because they are seen \nas people using their positions of power to pay themselves obscene amounts of \nmoney. They are seen, in other words, as examples of what goes wrong when \nsomething other than the market is at work. Even in their criticisms, people can then \nbe said to reproduce market ideas of fairness. The norms against which they assess \nactual transactions are deeply embedded in the practices of market exchange.  \nMarx argued in the Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875) that equal right \ncan never be higher than the economic structure of the society in which it is \nformulated, and that in a society still stamped by its birth marks from capitalism, it \nwill be impossible to think beyond the principle that regulates the exchange of \ncommodities, the principle of exchanging equal for equal. This aspect of Marx\u2019s claim \ncontinues to ring true, for markets do seem to sustain a particular conception of \nequality, a notion of equality as getting back the equivalent of what you gave.  \nThat focus on equivalence is one of the things Dworkin likes about markets, \nfor it is said to force us to think about the \u2018real\u2019 cost of our choices, and real burden \nthey impose on others, and weigh up whether a particular expenditure of effort or \nresources really is worth a particular outcome. Within the limits of this equivalence, it \nis clearly possible to think critically about how markets work: I am not offering a \nfatalistic argument in which no-one ever raises her sights above the limits of market \n                                                 \n51 For the largest 500 US companies, the ratio of CEO to production worker pay went up from 30 times \ngreater in 1970 to 570 times in 2000, mostly because of earnings from stock options.

As Frey\u2019s example indicates, non-economists tend to dislike the classically \nmarket ideal of suppliers rationing scarce goods by putting up their prices, while the \naverage economist sees this as better than making people queue or issuing ration \ncards. If markets do promote and sustain particular understandings of fairness, it \nseems they can simultaneously sustain the non-economist\u2019s idea that prices should \nreflect costs of production (because consumers ought to pay suppliers the equivalent \nof what it cost them to produce),  and the economist\u2019s idea that it is fair for suppliers \nto put up prices when shortages occur (because if people are willing to pay those \nprices, they must see the money they pay out as equivalent to the satisfaction they  \nanticipate from the purchase). Note, however, that both these rest on notions of \nequivalence, on getting back the equivalent of what you gave. There is scope for \ninterpreting and reinterpreting that norm, scope for competing understandings of \nequivalence. But it would be an enormous leap from either of the above to something \nlike the classically Marxist decoupling of input and rewards (\u2018from each according to \nhis ability, to each according to his needs\u2019), or to what Cohen once described as the \nanti-market principle \u2018according to which I serve you not because of what I can get \nout of doing so but because you need my service\u2019.52 It is a pretty big leap even to the \nposition so many egalitarians have tried to sustain over recent years, in which people \nare no longer entitled to rewards that flow from the exercise of their own talents.  \nThe third argument in favour of ideal theory is that maintaining a clear \ndistinction between ideals and conditions of implementation helps immunise us \nagainst the tendency to reduced ambition. The distinction asks us to work out our \nvalues in isolation from, or at least prior to, addressing the facts, but in doing so, it \nencourages us to think of these \u2018facts\u2019 as having no normative content. Ironically, it \nthen reinforces a tendency to think of the market as inherently neutral between \ndifferent distributions of resources or different conceptions of the good, as something \nwe can make use of for efficiency (and in Dworkin\u2019s argument, also equality) \npurposes without detracting from or reshaping our normative goals. My suggestion \nhere is that markets do not just generate actual inequalities. The norms and \nconventions that constitute actual markets also generate understandings of and \nattitudes towards equality, inclining us to think about fairness and justice in particular \nways. If so, it is unclear how useful it can be to construct ideals of justice or equality \n                                                 \n52 G A Cohen (1994) \u2018Back to Socialist Basics\u2019 New Left Review 207:9 \n 25\nin abstraction from the circumstances under which they are likely to be implemented. \nThe separation into two stages looks particularly problematic when it encourages \nrepresentations of the market as a relatively neutral tool.  \n \nConclusion \nThe rapprochement between egalitarians and the market might, in many ways, be \ntaken as a counter-trend to the supposed dominance of ideal theory, indicating a \nconcern with what is feasible, and a willingness to accommodate ideals to reality. \nThis would be a superficial interpretation. In any deeper sense, the flirtation with \nmarket metaphors and market models rests on a highly abstract understanding of \u2018the \nmarket\u2019. In her defence of abstraction, Onora O\u2019Neill distinguished between an \nidealisation that ascribes false predicates (thus clearly to be avoided) and an \nabstraction that brackets, rather than denying, certain predicates in order to achieve \ntheoretical advance.53 As she suggests, bracketing per se is unavoidable: any theory \nthat tried to capture every detail of the phenomena it was analysing would be not a \ntheory but a photograph (and as such, also selective and \u2018false\u2019). But the bracketing \nrequired to produce the abstraction of \u2018the market\u2019  - like the bracketing required to \nproduce \u2018the citizen\u2019 or \u2018the individual\u2019 -  cannot be regarded as neutral in its effects. \nIt brackets off the norms and conventions that regulate the behaviour of markets, \nincluding substantive norms about what it is reasonable to pay people or what counts \nas fair exchange, and in doing so misrepresents markets as more even-handed \nbetween different reward systems than is the case. It also brackets off the distribution \nof income for later consideration. In doing so, it biases policy recommendations in \nparticular \u2013 usually less socially ambitious - directions.  \nFew people today imagine solutions that disregard the market: pretty much all \nof us recognise that the societies we live in will continue to be organised on broadly \nmarket principles for as long as we can anticipate. What that means, however, is that \ndifferences between actual markets, between, that is, one kind of market society and \nanother, become increasingly important in the formulation of egalitarian alternatives. \nMy argument, in this paper, is that certain idealised ways of talking about \u2018the market\u2019 \ndo not help this process. The prospects for a more egalitarian, but still in some sense \nmarket, society must surely lie in differentiating more precisely the positive or \n                                                 \n53 Onora O\u2019Neill (1987) \u2018Abstraction, Idealisation, and Ideology in Ethics\u2019 in JDG Evans (ed) Moral \nPhilosophy and Contemporary Problems (Cambridge University Press) \n 26\ngenuinely neutral aspects of market exchange from those that are at most odds with \nequality, and then working to reduce or eliminate the latter. Talk of the market as \nideal type encourages us to think we can produce these differentiations directly out of \nour definitions, putting all the good or neutral aspects on the one side and relegating \nall the bad to the other. This is not a useful way to address the task of transforming \nactual market societies in a more egalitarian direction.  \n \n \n"}
