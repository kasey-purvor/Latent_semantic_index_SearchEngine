These include the nebulous and organic nature of interventions ensuing from policy\ndirectives, the tension between long-term goals and short-term interventions, the appropriateness\nof establishing control groups, and the problems of providing an economic perspective. An example\nof contemporary policy that has recently been subject to evaluation is the first phase of the\ninnovative Scottish strategy for suicide prevention (Choose Life).\nDiscussion and summary: This paper discusses how challenges, such as those above, were made\nmanifest within this programme. After a brief summary of the overarching approach taken to\nevaluating the first phase of Choose Life, this paper then offers a set of recommendations for\npolicymakers and evaluators on how learning from a second phase might be augmented. These\nrecommendations are likely to have general resonance across a range of policy evaluations as they\nmove from early planning and implementation to more mature phases.\nBackground\nIn recent years two interrelated sets of arguments about\nthe evaluation of public health policy have become com-\nmonplace. The first laments the lack of a robust evidence\nbase for developing policy, and charges evaluators to do\nbetter in producing such knowledge. This, it is argued,\nshould be brought about by the more frequent applica-\ntion of gold-standard approaches to complex interven-\ntions [1,2] and through adopting 'a more integrated\napproach to evaluation and implementation, using the\nmost robust and sound methodologies, and taking advan-\ntage of \"natural experiments\"' (p.40) [3].

We then briefly summarise the overarching\napproach taken to evaluating the first phase of Choose Life.\nFinally, we set out recommendations for framing subse-\nquent evaluation of the initiative as it enters its more\nmature second phase. These recommendations have\nimplications for policymakers and evaluators within pub-\nlic health and in wider policy domains.\nChoose Life was launched in 2002 as a major strand within\nthe National Programme for Improving Mental Health\nand Well-being in Scotland [10]. As with much contem-\nporary policy emanating from the Scottish Executive, the\nNational Programme was charged with tackling health\ninequalities within a wider health improvement agenda\n[11]. The overall aim of Choose Life was to reduce suicide\nby 20% over a ten year period through the achievement of\nobjectives such as improved early prevention and crisis\nresponse, engagement with the media and, adoption of an\nevidence-based approach. More detail on the guiding\nprinciples of Choose Life and its objectives and priority\ngroups is presented in table 1 below.\nThe Choose Life plan was to be implemented in two phases\nfrom 2003\u20132013. In phase one (2003\u20132006) \u00a39 m was\nallocated to local partnerships across each local authority\narea in Scotland, to be used for suicide prevention work,\nwhilst \u00a33 m was set aside for national activities in support\nof the plan. Local areas were, in addition, positively\nencouraged to generate additional resources for Choose\nLife activities. A further \u00a38.4 m was set aside for the first\ntwo years of the second phase (2006\u20132008). A more\ndetailed description of the structure of the initiative is pro-\nvided by Platt and colleagues [12].\nAn intention to evaluate phase one of Choose Life was sig-\nnalled in the national strategy and action plan [10] and,\nfollowing a competitive tendering process, a consortium\nof researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and Glas-\ngow, the London School of Economics and the Scottish\nDevelopment Centre for Mental Health was awarded a\ntwo year contract commencing in mid-2004.\nDiscussion\nA recent comparative review of suicide prevention strate-\ngies across the globe, carried out as part of the commis-\nTable 1: Choose Life: Principles, Objectives and Priority Groups\nGuiding principles\n\u2022 Shared responsibility (across Scottish Executive departments, sectors, agencies and organisational boundaries)\n\u2022 Effective leadership (nationally and locally\n\u2022 Taking a person-centred approach (recognising variation in individuals' experiences, often associated with key life stages)\n\u2022 Focus on priority approach (without losing sight of the broader needs of society as a whole)\n\u2022 Continuous quality improvement (drawing on, and developing, better information and evidence of what works)\nMain objectives\n\u2022 Early prevention and intervention\n\u2022 Responding to immediate crisis\n\u2022 Longer-term work to provide hope and support recovery\n\u2022 Coping with suicidal behaviour and completed suicide\n\u2022 Promoting greater public awareness and encouraging people to seek help early\n\u2022 Supporting the media\n\u2022 Knowing what works\nPriority groups\n\u2022 Children (especially looked after children)\n\u2022 Young people (especially young men)\n\u2022 People with mental health problems (particularly service users and people with severe mental illness)\n\u2022 People who attempt suicide\n\u2022 People affected by the aftermath of suicidal behaviour\n\u2022 People who abuse substances\n\u2022 People in prison\n\u2022 People who are recently bereaved\n\u2022 People who have recently lost employment or who have been unemployed for a period of time\n\u2022 People in isolated or rural communities\n\u2022 People who are homelessPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:146 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/146sioned Choose Life evaluation, highlighted that the\nmajority of government-funded efforts to generate learn-\ning about effective approaches have focused on evaluating\nspecific interventions rather than on national strategies\nper se [12]. For example, Mann and colleagues, in their\nreview of suicide prevention strategies, look at the impact\nof individual components of strategies rather than at the\neffect of an overall programme of activity [13]. Whilst\nAustralia commissioned a summative evaluation of its\nnational youth suicide prevention strategy, Scotland was\nunique in its investment in a national level formative eval-\nuation although other countries are now following suit.\nAlthough this provided a welcome opportunity to learn\nhow whole systems create the context for effective suicide\nprevention strategies, it raised an array of challenges for\nwould-be evaluators.\nIn this section we consider four specific issues that needed\nto be addressed in the evaluation of the first phase of\nChoose Life: how to learn from a complex initiative with\nmultiple stakeholders and outcomes; understanding secu-\nlar trends in reaching evaluative judgements (effective-\nness); attempting to provide an economic perspective on\nthe worth of a national programme (cost-effectiveness);\nand integrating data arising from a range of methodolog-\nical approaches. This list, while not exhaustive, repre-\nsented the most significant challenges for the evaluation\nteam.\nThe nature of complexity in policy initiatives\nCurrent approaches to making and implementing policy\nadd to programme complexity in a number of ways. Here\nwe briefly outline seven elements of this complexity and\nillustrate in Table 2 below the ways in which these were\nmade manifest in Choose Life.\nFirst, there is a growing recognition that there has been an\nexpansion in the number and types of roles that evalua-\ntors are expected to play [14-16]. In particular, policy eval-\nuators are now expected to provide developmental\nTable 2: Challenges of Complexity\nNature of the challenge Its manifestation in Choose Life\ni. The multiple purposes that \nevaluation is anticipated to serve\nThe national evaluation team had objectives in relation to: monitoring progress towards implementation of \nprogramme milestones; examining the extent to which effective practice was being generated; assessing the \ndevelopment of sustainable infrastructure; providing summative as well as formative feedback.\nii. Multiple outcomes of the \nprogramme\nThe programme had seven multi-faceted objectives. These were: \n1) Early prevention and intervention: providing earlier intervention and support to prevent problems and \nreduce the risks that might lead to suicidal behaviour;\n2) Responding to immediate crisis: providing support and services to people at risk and people in crisis, to \nprovide an immediate crisis response and to help reduce the severity of any immediate problem;\n3) Longer-term work to provide hope and support recovery: providing on-going support and services to \nenable people to recover and deal with the issues that may be contributing to their suicidal behaviour;\n4) Coping with suicidal behaviour and completed suicide: providing effective support to those who are \naffected by suicidal behaviour or a completed suicide;\n5) Promoting greater public awareness and encouraging people to seek help early: ensuring greater public \nawareness of positive mental health and well-being, suicidal behaviour, potential problems and risks amongst \nall age groups, and encouraging people to seek help early;\n6) Supporting the media: ensuring that any depiction or reporting by any section of the media of a completed \nsuicide or suicidal behaviour is undertaken sensitively and appropriately and with due respect for \nconfidentiality; and,\n7) Knowing what works: improving the quality, collection and availability of information on issues relating to \nsuicide and suicidal behaviour and on effective interventions to ensure the better design and implementation \nof responses and services and use of resources.\niii. Horizontal complexity The local authority areas received their funding through the Community Planning Partnership mechanism. \nThese statutory planning groups had representation from across public sector organisations (such as the \nNHS, local government and education) and the voluntary sector. The national level also required partnerships \nto be made and sustained between a wide range of organisations.\niv. Vertical complexity Impacts were anticipated among individuals at risk, their families, the organisations with which they engage, \nand at a structural level.\nv. The lack of opportunity to \nestablish control\/comparison \ngroups\nAll local authority areas in Scotland were provided with funding to take forward Choose Life. It was not \npossible, therefore, to identify areas within the country that could act as 'controls'.\nvi. Context as integral to a \nprogramme intervention\nLocal areas were given flexibility in how they organised the local manifestations of Choose Life. For example, \nthey were able to identify their own local priority groups in addition to those identified by the Scottish \nExecutive, determine how their funding would be utilised, and develop their own management arrangements \nfor the programme of work undertaken.\nvii. Long-term goals To reduce the rate of suicide in Scotland by 20% by 2013Page 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:146 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/146support to programmes as well as to make judgements of\nimpact, and to provide formative as well as summative\nfeedback. Whilst the evaluation of the first phase of Choose\nLife was explicitly focused on the process of implementa-\ntion, there were, nonetheless, requests from funders for\nthe evaluation team to answer questions of effectiveness.\nNegotiating, and remaining focused on, the purpose of an\nevaluation is, therefore, a key challenge; such purpose\nwill, in addition, change as the evaluation moves from a\ndevelopmental to a theory-testing stage.\nSecond, national programmes involving a wide range of\nstakeholders inevitably involve multiple outcomes [17].\nChoose Life is a useful example of this. Although the\nnational strategy set itself one long-term target (to reduce\nthe suicide rate in Scotland by 20% between 2002 and\n2013), the local areas were given seven key objectives and\nwere expected to meet 12 milestones (progress towards\nthese measures is detailed by Platt and colleagues [12].\nMultiple outcomes do not simply muddy the waters for\nevaluators through increasing the range of data to be col-\nlected. A feature of complex initiatives is that there is a\ngeneral lack of clarity about when change across and\nbetween outcomes is anticipated because of the unknown\nsynergies that may occur [18]. The evaluator, therefore,\ncan struggle to identify the most appropriate point at\nwhich to look for outcomes and the order in which they\nwill appear. Furthermore stakeholders' outcomes can be\nincompatible and disagreements can occur regarding the\nprimary focus of an impact assessment.\nThird, as described by Connell and Kubisch [17], strategic\napproaches to tackling health and social problems exhibit\n'horizontal complexity'. This means that a range of differ-\nent organisations, often with mismatched agendas, have a\nstake in the outcomes (or funding) of an initiative. This\nmay be particularly problematic where funding is dis-\nbursed locally to partnership bodies (Community Plan-\nning Partnerships in the case of Choose Life) whose\nmember organisations have different approaches to men-\ntal health promotion and to how evidence is gathered and\ninterpreted. In addition, the Choose Life programme man-\nifested horizontal complexity at a national level, with its\nNational Implementation Support Team charged with\nworking in partnership with other bodies at a Scotland-\nwide level. Once again, experience of evaluating such ini-\ntiatives has demonstrated that the evaluator has a tricky\nbalance to maintain in satisfying the requirements of dif-\nferent stakeholders.\nFourth, complexity is further increased in strategies that\naim to impact on organisations, specific professionals and\npractices, communities and individuals ('vertical com-\nplexity'). Potential outcomes can start to multiply expo-\nnentially [17]. Evaluators cannot and should not measure\neverything: they need to develop a purposive strategy for\ndetermining what will be assessed and maintain a focus\non this throughout the course of an evaluation.\nFifth, evaluators who seek to use controlled research\ndesigns to demonstrate that observed changes can be\nattributed to the implementation of the programme may\nfind that complex initiatives are ill-suited to such\napproaches. Where programmes are delivered in a small\nnumber of pilot areas, the thrust of policy momentum can\nresult in programme diffusion to what might have been\nregarded as appropriate control sites [7,8]. This is clearly\nexacerbated in strategies where no pilot work is under-\ntaken and an initiative is launched across an entire coun-\ntry, as with Choose Life. Some commentators have argued\nthat, with minor design modifications, the practical prob-\nlems of carrying out randomised controlled trials can be\novercome [19]. The political realities of strategy develop-\nment and implementation within the UK, however, throw\nthis into question. A randomised design is also compro-\nmised by the lack of comparability of interventions and\ntheir implementation processes between intervention\nareas.\nA sixth ingredient of complexity is that programmes are\nshaped by the contexts in which they are located. The\nbody of literature emerging from a theory-based approach\nto evaluation argues that it is inappropriate and simplistic\nto ask whether an intervention works, since an interven-\ntion is made up of a myriad of interacting components,\nand because some elements will work for particular\ngroups of individuals in specific contexts and circum-\nstances [20-22]. Each of the local areas charged with\nimplementing Choose Life has its own organisational his-\ntory and was given freedom to deliver the programme in\nlocally determined ways. Understanding context, there-\nfore, becomes a more important evaluation task than\nironing it out through a controlled design. Nevertheless,\nunderstanding the contribution made by a programme to\nobserved change remains a concern for evaluators. We\nexpand on this in the following section.\nFinally, complex health and social programmes are\nlaunched to tackle the most intractable problems. Their\nlong-term goals, therefore, are ambitious and, more\nimportantly, lie beyond the timescales of the interven-\ntions set up to deliver them and the evaluations designed\nto measure them. This challenges evaluators to select\nplausible, robust and short-term intermediate or proxy\nmeasures of the more distal intended outcome(s). In the\nmetaphor of our title, the long term outcome of interest is\nthe absence of suicide events (the dog that doesn't bark in\nthe night). Whilst we cannot realistically capture this\nwithin the life of an evaluation, the evaluator's goal is to\nensure that process measures are appropriate proxies forPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:146 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/146this ultimate outcome (in other words, to make a case for\nthe measurement of the tail of the dog as a predictor of its\nfuture barking behaviour). In suicide prevention evalua-\ntions the quest for appropriate proxies is made difficult by\nthe deficiencies of the existing evidence base. There\nremains a significant leap in the dark, for example, from\nthe provision of mental health awareness programmes in\nsecondary school to the prevention of suicide attempts in\nthe community at some future date. Likewise, there is\ndebate about the value of proxies such as hospital-treated\nself-harm as a marker for later suicide [23].\nSecular trends\nAs discussed above, demonstrating that a programme has\nled to a change in outcome is not in itself enough to con-\nvince observers that the intervention has played a causal\nrole. This is true in particular when trends in the outcome\nof interest are on a downward slope. For example, the\nrates for suicides and undetermined deaths for men in\nScotland rose to a peak in 1992 (34.2\/100,000 popula-\ntion aged 15+ years), remained at (or just below) this high\nlevel until 2002 (34.1\/100,000), after which there has\nbeen a decline to 27.1\/100,000 in 2005 (lowest rate since\n1991) [12]. The decline since 2002 may be attributable in\npart to Choose Life activities. However, the massive reduc-\ntion in male suicide and undetermined deaths between\n2002 (n = 673, rate = 34.1\/100,000) and 2003 (n = 577,\nrate = 29.1\/100,000) occurred when Choose Life had only\nbeen very partially implemented and is instead probably\ndue, in large part, to the influence of other factors (e.g. leg-\nislation restricting paracetamol sales [23-25]). In the\nabsence of control data there is, therefore, a significant\nchallenge in interpreting trends over time.\nThis is exacerbated by the relative rarity of suicide as an\nevent. It becomes virtually impossible for evaluators to\npropose (dis)confirmable explanations for observed\nchanges in trends over short time periods (in this instance,\ntwo years) and at a small area level. Teasing out the possi-\nble impact of different strategic approaches within the\numbrella of Choose Life on rates of suicide is equally prob-\nlematic. Once again this points to the need for plausible\nshort-term indicators of progress but without evidence of\nstrong indicators of suicidal behaviour this remains diffi-\ncult.\nUndertaking an economic analysis\nAs debates about scarcity of resources within the NHS\ngrow, there is a parallel increase in policy interest in\naddressing the cost-effectiveness of differing approaches\nto health improvement, yet economic evaluations of com-\nplex public health interventions remain relatively rare\n[26]. Sefton [27] has argued, that bringing health eco-\nnomic perspectives from the field of narrowly defined\ntechnology assessment into the domain of complex policy\nevaluation raises both practical and epistemological diffi-\nculties. First and foremost, approaches to assessing cost-\neffectiveness rely on the existence of robust measures of\nboth costs and benefits. At the level of policy and public\nhealth interventions, however, these types of data are\nwoefully limited and the problems that beset randomised\ncontrolled trials also undermine the use of standard\nhealth economic techniques [28]. In addition, the eco-\nnomic notion of time preference has meant that short\nterm outcomes, more likely to be seen in health care inter-\nventions, are usually deemed to have greater economic\nbenefits than health promoting interventions that may\ntake several years to achieve change. [30,31] Second, par-\nadigmatic conflicts between those working in the field of\ntraditional outcome studies and those dealing with the\ncomplexities of messy policy evaluation can result in ster-\neotypical and blinkered views of the contribution to be\nmade by different disciplines and research approaches.\nFor example, McDaid and colleagues argue that, within\nthe field of suicide prevention, an economist's focus on a\nsingle outcome, such as the rate of suicide or the number\nof life years saved, may be viewed as inappropriately\nreductionist by those interested in capturing the complex-\nity of synergistic approaches to mental health promotion\n[28]. Conversely, a focus on process and organisational\nchange to the detriment of measurable outcomes may be\nviewed by economists as a failure to pursue an interven-\ntion's bottom line. As Sefton argues, making these 'ends\nmeet' requires not only that evaluation teams are multi-\ndisciplinary in name but also that they practise in an inte-\ngrative fashion [27].\nIntegrating findings\nAchieving an integrated approach to evaluation is much\nless straightforward than it sounds. Accepting the need to\naddress questions of process and outcome and designing\nan evaluation that will seek to gather data which are\nappropriate to both can still result in 'silo evaluations',\nwith the final report summarising results in separate sec-\ntions. In their evaluation of the Total Purchasing Pilot in\nprimary care, Evans and colleagues illustrate this through\ntheir description of how, in the absence of an a priori the-\noretical framework, members of a multidisciplinary team\nwere left to undertaken their own sub-components of a\nmulti-method evaluation [32]. Even explicit and pre-emp-\ntive attempts to be integrative, such as the use of theory-\nbased approaches to evaluation, can struggle to combine\ndata from different sources [7].\nOur approach\nAlthough aware of the challenges that have beset policy\nevaluations in recent years when we embarked on our\nevaluation of the first phase of Choose Life, we neverthe-\nless struggled to find satisfactory solutions through our\nevaluation approach and practice. Here we summarise thePage 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:146 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/146main aims of the national evaluation of Choose Life as set\nout within the research brief and the general evaluation\nframework that we used.\nAt its most general level the purpose of the national eval-\nuation was to 'assess ... infrastructure and early impacts' of\nChoose Life and to 'set the template for the next phase' of\nthe strategy [10]. Its aims are detailed in table 3 below:\nOur overarching evaluation framework derived from The-\nories of Change [20,22]. This approach, designed specifi-\ncally for the evaluation of complex, multiple outcome and\nmulti-partner programmes, aims to study cumulatively\nthe links between the purposive activities undertaken to\ntackle significant social problems, their short-term out-\ncomes and processes, and longer-term goals. It seeks to\naddress questions about which components of an overall\nprogramme work for which individuals in which sets of\ncircumstances. In this regard it is well suited to the evalu-\nation of a national strategy that is expected to operate dif-\nferently in different local contexts, since it aims to capture\nwhy and how local variations occur. It also explicitly rec-\nognises that different stakeholders within an intervention\nwill have potentially competing expectations of a pro-\ngramme and seeks to deal with this by encouraging a col-\nlaborative approach to agreeing a theory of change and\nprioritising key indicators and outcomes for tracking\nprogress.\nWhilst the approach is not without its practical and con-\nceptual difficulties [33-35], it does nonetheless aim to\nprovide an integrative framework for data generation and\ninterpretation. For example, using the approach allows\nquestions of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness to be\nembedded in a chain of events linking complex organisa-\ntional processes, monitoring data and proxy measures of\nprogramme success. Its main difficulties include its time-\nconsuming nature, the challenges of eliciting detailed and\nwell-specified theories from stakeholders, and (of particu-\nlar significance in the evaluation of Choose Life) how to\nbridge gaps in knowledge between unsatisfactory proxy\nmeasures and the long-term goal of a programme. This\nlatter problem can be illustrated by comparing a suicide\nprevention programme with a strategy to reduce coronary\nheart disease: whilst a three year heart disease programme\nmight be deemed successful if it reduces levels of risk fac-\ntors such as obesity or smoking, the links between self-\nharm incidence and suicide incidence are less clear-cut.\nNonetheless, a Theories of Change approach has provided\nan evaluation framework that allowed researchers from a\nrange of disciplines to work towards an integrated set of\nevaluation questions and helped to direct the team\ntowards the selection of appropriate methods, including\ndocumentary analysis, interviews, group exercises and sur-\nveys [10]. An evaluation database was designed and uti-\nlised to store and retrieve data that were analysed\niteratively and thematically. The data generated were, in\naddition, put in the context of international approaches to\nsuicide prevention.\nWhilst no separate economic data collection was under-\ntaken, the research instruments developed for use in the\nstudy were deliberately informed by an economic perspec-\ntive. Although imperfect, these allowed the evaluation\nteam to consider the extent to which Choose Life stimu-\nlated additional local investment from their partnership\norganisations, including in-kind investments and the con-\ntribution of unpaid volunteers, targeted resources at rele-\nvant priority groups, spent their funding on proven\neffective practice and interventions, and stimulated local\ninnovation.\nIn summary our approach aimed to provide a formative\nassessment of whether processes and short-term out-\ncomes at far remove from the distal outcome \u2013 reduced\nrates of suicide \u2013 were being encouraged at a local and\nnational level. It is not within the remit of this paper to\ndiscuss the findings of the evaluation \u2013 these are pre-\nsented elsewhere [12], however, through the approach\nadopted the team were able to make recommendations\nconcerning future investments in suicide prevention, sus-\ntainability, targeting of efforts, the integration of self-\nharm into suicide prevention strategies and the role of\nlocal and national partnerships. To illustrate we provide\nsome specific examples. First, in relation to targeting local\naction we found that the long list of priority groups set by\nChoose Life was unhelpful since it led to rank ordering at a\nlocal level, and, in some cases, a lack of focus on local\nneeds assessment. Second, in terms of sustainability, our\ndata suggest that, whilst the initiative acted as an unprec-\nTable 3: National Evaluation of Choose Life \u2013 Main Aims\n1.

On the basis of findings, and in consultation with the Scottish Executive and the Research Advisory Group steering the evaluation, provide \ndetailed and staged recommendations to guide the next phase of the action plan to achieve a 20 per cent reduction in suicides in Scotland by 2013, \nand the targeting of any funding available to support the next phasePage 6 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBMC Public Health 2007, 7:146 http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/7\/146edented rallying call for cross-sectoral planning to embed\nsuicide prevention within the mental health improve-\nment agenda, the local and national contexts made it dif-\nficult to bring together clinical and community\napproaches to prevention and treatment. Finally, in terms\nof defining the boundaries of Choose Life there was evi-\ndence of considerable variation across the programme of\nhow 'high risk' suicidal behaviour was conceptualised and\ntackled. This suggests that nationally greater consideration\nneeds to be given to how action on self-harm is integrated\nwithin a wider suicide prevention strategy.\nSummary\nAs discussed earlier, learning from the first phase of Choose\nLife was expected to feed into its second and more mature\nimplementation phase. Many commentators who argue\nthat public health and social care programmes, like med-\nical interventions, should ideally be submitted to testing\nthrough randomised controlled trials acknowledge that\nthis may be impossible in the early stages of implementa-\ntion as national strategies struggle to find their local feet\n[36]. Instead they suggest that, once interventions have\nmatured into stable entities, then they can be evaluated\nusing gold standard approaches. Notwithstanding the\nimpossibility of utilising a controlled approach to an\nintervention that has already been rolled out nationally,\nthere are other difficulties with this suggestion. Above all,\nit is questionable whether social programmes ever\nbecome stable interventions \u2013 more likely they will\nstrengthen or weaken and constantly evolve as part of a\nlocal and national system for tackling health improve-\nment.\nTo help generate learning for the future we make the fol-\nlowing recommendations that build on those contained\nin our final report [12]. First, an integrative framework\nsuch as Theories of Change should continue to shape pur-\nposive strategies for generating evidence. Second, work to\ndetermine nationally and locally acceptable proxy meas-\nures of success for phase two should be undertaken and\nresulting targets used to stimulate action rather than to\ncreate perverse incentives [37]. Third, continued efforts to\nlearn about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dif-\nferent strategies for intervening to promote mental health,\nprevent suicide, and alleviate its effects in different con-\ntexts should be prioritised \u2013 ongoing routine but compa-\nrable data collection on the uptake of different individual\ninterventions and the resource contributions of unpaid\nvolunteers to their delivery should be an important ele-\nment of this process. Fourth, learning about the impact of\ndifferent organisational structures on proxy indicators of\nprogress should be undertaken through case-study evalu-\nations of contrasting approaches. Fifth, whilst suicide pre-\nvention is a unique goal, efforts to capitalise on learning\nacross policy domains about how to interpret\/utilise evi-\ndence and mainstream good practice should be maxim-\nised. Finally, measuring trends in suicide rates will remain\nan important strand of monitoring progress only insofar\nas it is undertaken sensitively, with due cognisance of the\nsmall number of events involved and the distorting effect\nof 'natural' year on year fluctuations. With such a strategy\nin place, useful learning may emerge about how to impact\npositively on mental health and well-being and suicide\nprevention at strategic and local, as well as programme\nand practice, levels. Only then will we be in the position\nto judge whether we have appropriately measured the dog\nthat doesn't bark in the night.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter-\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nAll authors were involved in conception and design of the\nChoose Life evaluation or in data acquisition and inter-\npretation.
