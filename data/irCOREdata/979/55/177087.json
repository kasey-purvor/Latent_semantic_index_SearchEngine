The \nMeasles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is widely recommended \ninternationally for all children with the aim of protecting against measles, mumps, \nand rubella. In the UK (unlike other countries such as the USA where childhood \nvaccination is compulsory), childhood vaccination is voluntary but parents are \nencouraged to accept immunisation for their children. The Government policy \nobjective is to achieve \u2018herd immunity,\u2019 for which high uptake rates are required. \n 2  \nThe target of the UK immunisation programme for MMR is for 95% of children to \nreceive it by 24 months of age (www.isdscotland.org).  \n \nControversy surrounding the safety of MMR was precipitated by the publication of a \nstudy in 1998 reporting a new syndrome of bowel disease and autism in twelve \nchildren (Wakefield, Murch, Linnell, Casson, Malik and Bewrelowitz, 1998). The \nauthors speculated about a link between the MMR vaccine and inflammatory bowel \ndisease and autism, and recommended more research into the possible risks of the \nvaccine. Their press release made a case for giving separate vaccines against measles, \nmumps and rubella (Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine. New research links \nautism and bowel disease, press release, 27 February 1998), although single vaccines \nwere not recommended by the Government and were not freely available. \n \nAlthough some parents had been noticing potential adverse reactions to MMR \npreviously (Fitzpatrick, 2004), publicity about this study generated significant \nconcern among parents, and vaccination rates declined significantly.  In 1995-6, 92% \nof children in England had been immunised by their 2nd birthday. This fell to around \n87% in 2000-2001, 84% in 2001-2002, and 79.8% by late 2004. Similar changes \noccurred in Scotland (HPA 2004; HPS 2004). The study and reactions to it prompted \nfurther research to investigate the possible association between the MMR vaccine \nand autism, but the numerous epidemiological studies conducted subsequently have \nfound no evidence of a link (Medical Research Council, 2001). \n \n 3  \nThe MMR controversy generated much academic interest, and a number of studies \nused surveys, interviews and focus groups to investigate parents\u2019 attitudes to, and \ndecisions about, the vaccine (e.g. Pareek and Pattison 2000; Evans, Stoddart, Condon, \nFreeman, Grizzell, and Mullen, 2001; Health Education Board for Scotland 2001; \nLunts and Cowper 2002; Petts and Niemeyer 2004; Poltorak, Leach, Fairhead and \nCassell, 2005; Hilton, Pettigrew and Hunt, 2006; Cassell, Leach, Poltorak, Mercer, \nIverson and Fairhead 2006; Casiday 2007).  These studies have generated broadly \nconsistent insights. Parental decision-making about MMR has been shown to be \ninfluenced by a complex range of factors, especially perceptions of their own child\u2019s \nvulnerability to any risk from MMR, and the perceived trustworthiness of different \nsources of information.  \n \nWe report on a study that examined discussions about MMR among parents who \nparticipated in an online chat forum. We focus particularly on discussions about \n\u2018avoiding harm to others,\u2019 which were important considerations for many parents \nwithin our sample and apparently influential in their vaccination decisions.  \n \nMethods \nWe used an internet discussion forum to investigate public opinion. This is an \ninnovative form of data collection with significant potential. As Rier (2007) argued, \n\"online support groups constitute natural, colossal, floating focus groups, offering an \nunusual opportunity for researchers to tap into specific segments of public opinion, \nand to watch how it forms, as it forms.\u201d \n 4  \n Our analysis focussed on the web site www.mumsnet.com.  \u2018Mumsnet\u2019 was \nlaunched in July 2000 by two UK parents. It describes itself as a website \u201coffering \nproduct reviews and parenting tips by parents for parents.\u201d By 2001 it was attracting \n10,000 people a month and in July 2007 it had 300,000 monthly users (Lane, 2007). \n\u2018Mumsnet\u2019 members can start discussions on any subject of interest or add messages \nto existing conversations. The web site allows \u2018non-member\u2019 visitors to search the \ndiscussion forum archives using keywords.   \n \nWe chose this particular website for two main reasons. First, it had a large archive of \ndiscussion \u2018threads\u2019 about MMR. Although other websites were more clearly \nfocused on vaccination issues (see e.g. www.jabs.org.uk) they had not generated \nsuch a volume of online discussion and were perhaps less likely to attract parents \nwith a range of opinions about vaccination. Second, the public nature of the site \nminimised concern about examining talk that people might have wanted to keep \nprivate. The archives of discussion threads on \u2018Mumsnet\u2019 are accessible without any \nrequest to register or \u2018log on\u2019 to the web site. The venue is thus perceived as a \n\u2018public\u2019 rather than a \u2018private\u2019 sphere (Eysenbach and Till 2001). Mumsnet members \nare told that their postings on the discussion forum will be publicly available, and \nare asked to anonymise their postings by using a \u2018chat nickname\u2019 and adopting \ncodes when referring to members of their family. Participants complied with this \nrequest and were not identifiable from their postings. We observed archived \ndiscussions without posting any messages so the degree of \u2018intrusiveness\u2019 of our \n 5  \nresearch was minimal: we were not actively involved in online discussions either as \ndeclared researchers or covert participants. For practical and ethical reasons, we \njudged it inappropriate to solicit additional personal data for the purposes of our \nresearch.  \n \nWe focused on the two largest discussion threads which had numerous participants, \ncontinued over extended periods of time, and dealt with many aspects of the MMR \ndebate. The earlier, longer discussion thread ran from August 31st 2000 to February \n13th 2002 and the more recent discussion took place between January 18th 2003 and \nMarch 5th 2003).  Our initial categorisation of message content provided information \nabout the range and frequency of issues discussed, and information sources referred \nto. We then conducted a thematic analysis using a modified Framework approach \n(Ritchie and Spencer, 1994) to explore in more detail how participants discussed \nparticular topics. Initial separate analyses of the two discussion threads revealed \nextensive thematic similarity between them. To avoid excessive repetition, the \ncontent of both threads are discussed together here. \n \nIn this paper we focus on one of the prominent topics, the issue of \u2018avoiding harm to \nothers\u2019. Other studies exploring parental views about MMR have mentioned this \nissue but found that considerations of \u2018avoiding harm\u2019 to their own child were \nparamount (e.g Cassiday 2007; Poltorak et al 2005; Health Education Board for \nSoctland 2001). We found that the issue of \u2018avoiding harm to others\u2019 was a prominent \ntheme, with message postings on this topic being particularly lengthy and \n 6  \nsometimes hostile and judgemental  We discuss how individual considerations \nabout their own and other children\u2019s immune status had implications for discussions \nabout social responsibility to be vaccinated. \n \nFindings \nSample size and characteristics \nTable 1 indicates the duration and size of the two discussion threads, and the \nnumbers of messages posted by participants. 132 different participants contributed a \ntotal of 617 messages to the two discussion threads. Eleven participants took part in \nboth threads and fifteen participants contributed more than 10 messages each. \n \nThread 1, labeled \u2018MMR jabs\u2019, was triggered by a parent asking about alternatives to \nthe MMR vaccine and whether single vaccines were still available in France (they \nwere not available on the National Health Service in the UK). At the time of data \ncollection, this thread had reached its maximum length and no new postings could \nbe made. Thread 2, labeled \u2018MMR single vaccines just a little bit of info please,\u2019 was \ninitiated by a parent asking for advice about single vaccines after receiving an \nappointment card from her GP for her child\u2019s MMR vaccination. The last posting \nwas made on March 5th 2003. The initial short questions posted by the two parents \ngenerated rich discussions on a range of topics relating to MMR which continued \nover time. Parents argued and negotiated different positions.  \n \n 7  \nOur data source did not include demographic information about participants. \nHowever, chat \u2018nicknames\u2019 and references in postings to husbands\/boyfriends, sons \nand daughters, GPs, the UK government, and particular TV programmes and \nnewspapers suggested that most participants in both discussions were female, had \nyoung children and lived in the UK.  \n \n89 participants (67.4%) discussed decisions they had made (or intentions they had) \nfor a specific child or children with regard to MMR vaccination. A range of choices \nwere reported and diverse reasons given (Table 2 and Box 1).  \n \n \nVaccinating to help protect others \nConsiderations of social responsibility and of the importance of children being \nvaccinated to prevent disease spread were particularly striking within our data. As \nthe following quotes illustrate, although there was a strong emphasis in discussions \non the need to protect their own child from potential disease and vaccine risk, \nparents also expressed a concern to protect others in society, and this was apparently \ninfluential in some parents\u2019 decision-making:  \n \n \u201cI very much wanted my child to be vaccinated against rubella \nbecause I could not live with myself if a baby was born \ncatastrophically damaged (can you imagine a worse hell than being \n 8  \ndeaf and blind?) Because of me & my child passing on an illness\u2026\u201d \n(Aloha \u2013 chose single vaccines) \n \n \u201cI had my daughter immunised so I hope she helps not to spread \nthis needless measles outbreak to children whose parents didn't \nhave them vaccinated... Because Lill, I don't have an 'I'm alright \nJack' attitude. I do worry about other kids getting measles, \nmumps, rubella even though dd [daughter] has been vaccinated, \njust as I worry about lots of things that might not affect me \npersonally\u201d (Enid \u2013 chose MMR) \n \nThe implications to other people of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children \nwere widely discussed during conversations about the three diseases MMR is \ndesigned to prevent. We use the case of rubella to illustrate. \n \nThe rubella virus has relatively mild effects in most people, but can be very \ndamaging to unborn babies. Participants considered the potential consequences of \nrubella vaccination for others, especially pregnant women and their unborn \nchildren. In contrast to the non-directive nature of discussion of other issues (e.g. \nwhether to choose single vaccines instead of MMR), discussion about vaccinating for \nthe sake of others included several clear attempts to influence other parents\u2019 \nbehaviour.  For example: \n 9  \n \u201c\u2026Last week I met a woman my age (30s) who is totally deaf, since \nbirth because her mother had rubella while pregnant. I guess this \nMMR debate must make her quite angry. It\u2019s not her fault or her \nmother's that she is deaf. You can't expect all mothers to be to \nplan jabs. Plenty of women get pregnant without planning, many \ndon't know if they have already had rubella (do you?). Its up to us \nall in society to protect 'the herd!'\u201d (Lil).  \n \nParticipants recognised that women could theoretically take individual responsibility \nfor their own rubella immunity status, but several acknowledged that it was \nunrealistic to expect all to do so: \n   \u201c...If vaccination was left up to women to ask for it the end result \nwould be more children born blind and deaf. I'm a pragmatist and \nI'd rather have a well run rubella vaccination programme to protect \nthose children than leave it up to individual responsibility\u201d (Elliott). \n \n Only two participants dissented from this view, arguing that pregnant women \nshould be responsible for ensuring their own immunity status and not be reliant on \nchildren to protect them. In response to the dominant view in favour of vaccinating \nto protect others, these two parents argued that people (especially children) should \n 10  \nnot be expected to accept the risks of MMR vaccination \u2013 particularly when the \nrubella component would bring them no personal benefit: \n \n \u201cI cannot see why I should expose my child to the risk of a \ncombined vaccine to safeguard mothers and doctors that do not \ntake responsibility for their own health\u201d (SBLB). \n \n\u201c\u2026I really do have an issue with Rubella, which is purely vaccinated \nagainst for public health reasons. Why shouldn't women take \nresponsibility for their own rubella-immune status\u2026 I understand \nit's to try and eradicate the disease totally, but it seems to me \nthat rubella is only a danger to pregnant women, and not to every \nman, woman and child on the planet\u201d (Frieda). \n \nHowever, after reading subsequent postings and checking figures relating to \nrecorded infections of pregnant women since the introduction of MMR, the second \nof these parents changed her opinion:  \n \n\u201cYes, elliott, I did know that it was the unborn child that was at \nrisk, rather than the mother. But I thought that the pre-MMR \nrubella campaign (where girls only were vaccinated at about 13) was \n 11  \npretty successful in preventing the infection (and subsequent very \nhigh risk of foetal damage) of unborn babies. I've now checked my \nfacts\u2026And, yes, Aloha, that's a very good point about no \nvaccination being 100% effective. So I'm prepared to revise my \nview on this one\u201d (Frieda).  \n \n(This is a good example of how parents responded interactively to each other, \nand of how some changed their understandings and opinions over time).  \n \nWhen discussing mumps and measles, the protection of other children was also an \nissue. The concept of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 featured in a number of postings and there \nwas widespread acceptance that this was important both in terms of preventing \nepidemics and in terms of protecting the more vulnerable members of society.  \n \nWho bears the burden for what benefit? \nWhen discussing issues relating to herd immunity, parents often differentiated \nbetween \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018vulnerable\u2019 children. Children who were regarded as \npotentially vulnerable to vaccine damage included those with auto-immune \nconditions or those susceptible to allergies. These children were contrasted with \n\u2018healthy\u2019 children who were perceived to possess stronger immune systems and be \nbetter able to \u201ccope\u201d with exposure to disease or vaccines.   These differentiations \nwere quite striking and related not just to who needed protecting, but also to who \nshould bear the burden of vaccinating.  \n 12  \n Participants who did not report having significant concerns about the safety of the \nMMR vaccine (or its effectiveness in preventing the three infectious diseases) were \nmore likely to claim to believe they had a responsibility to ensure that their child \nwas vaccinated in order to prevent the spread of disease, and to protect children \nwho, for medical reasons, or because of their age, could not be vaccinated. Although \na sense of responsibility to protect other women\u2019s unborn children helped motivate \nsome to get their own child vaccinated against rubella, the fact that the unborn child \ncould potentially be their own was sometimes mentioned.  \n \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just our [son] that I considered but also the welfare of \nthe other children with whom he comes into contact and the \nexpectant mothers that he may encounter when he grows up (not \nleast me should we have another) (Harrysmum \u2013 chose MMR) \n \nIn their messages, these participants were often critical of parents who had decided \nnot to vaccinate their healthy children with MMR. Some of their comments on this \nissue were quite judgemental when considered in the context of the usual respectful \ntone of discussions on Mumsnet. Two main criticisms were made: first, they relied \non others for protection without contributing to the herd immunity that they \nbenefited from (sometimes called \u2018free-riding\u2019); and second, they were potentially \nexposing vulnerable children to disease (by not getting their own children \nvaccinated and thus making the spread of disease more likely).  For example: \n 13  \n \u201cYes, Lill, Pupuce et al you seem to have forgotten that your \nunvaccinated child will have far less of a chance of catching \nMeasles\/rubella etc because the rest of us have built up a herd \nimmunity. A thank-you would be appreciated!! - but as others have \nsaid there's the weaker elements of the herd that do need \nprotecting\u201d(Lil). \n \n\u201cI don\u2019t think my son should be put at risk of an epidemic because \npeople haven\u2019t had their children immunised. I don\u2019t think my \nunborn child should be put at risk of rubella either (although I \nbelieve my immunity is ok)\u201d (Joe1). \n \nThe participants who made these criticisms urged parents with \u201cno excuse\u201d for not \nimmunising to get their children \u201cdone\u201d for the benefit of society as a whole, and for \nthree particular vulnerable groups: children who could not be vaccinated for medical \nreasons; children who were too young to be vaccinated; and the unborn children of \nunvaccinated pregnant women. For example:  \n \n[Comment addressed directly to a participant with a child who could not be \nvaccinated for medical reasons]: \n 14  \n\u201cDear Lizp - it is specifically for reasons such as yours that people \nshould have their children immunised to protect those children who \nare unable to be vaccinated\u2026. So, all those people with no excuse \nfor not having their kids immunised, lets get them done so children \nlike Lizp's won't contract measles\u201d (Emmam). \n \n \u201c\u2026Could I just make the point that the risk of not immunising one's \nchildren does not only extend to one's own child. My ds [son] is 6 \n1\/2m - therefore too young for the MMR. Since we live near the \ncurrent outbreak and he is at nursery, I am concerned that he now \nhas a much greater risk of exposure because of other parents \ndecisions, yet we have no way of protecting him...\u201d (bossykate). \n \n\u201cEmmy - rubella can be passed onto a pregnant women damaging her \nunborn child\u2026 some people can't have vaccines hence the reason \nwhy the rest of us shouldn't put them at risk\u201d (Eulalia). \n \nIn summary, several Mumsnet participants urged parents of children whom they considered \n\u2018healthy\u2019 to opt for vaccination for the benefit of others in society. \n \nSingle vaccines as an alternative to MMR \n 15  \nSingle vaccines were much discussed on \u2018Mumsnet\u2019. Although some participants \ncompared them unfavourably with MMR, most people who discussed them claimed \nthey were unlikely to cause harm and thought the government should make them \nfreely available. \n \nParents who discussed opting for (or intending to opt for) single vaccines instead of \nMMR avoided the criticisms levelled against parents who apparently were not \nintending to vaccinate their healthy children at all. Some presented single vaccines \nas a means to avoid any potential risk from MMR but still protect their own child \nfrom disease and act in a socially responsible way. They accepted there was an \nargument for opting for vaccination to benefit society, but because of their doubts \nover the safety of the MMR vaccine, questioned why they could not use the single \nvaccine alternatives that they thought would be safer. They accepted the idea of \nsocial responsibility, but made judgements about the level of risk and the necessity \nfor the risk they believed they were being asked to take for the sake of others. For \nexample: \n \nThe arguments for \"herd immunity\" are pressing - examples of \nwhy those who can be immunised\u2026 have been given here and I \ntoo know a very prematurely born toddler who can't have his \nMMR for the foreseeable future. But if I thought that a \nvaccine that might not be the safest was being pressed on us in \nthe interests of the pharmaceuticals industry's profits, and \n 16  \nthat the Department of Health was being forced into this \npolicy, I'd be very angry\u2026 I do think it's possible to be \nconcerned about vaccine safety without compromising \"herd \nimmunity\" and putting others at risk\u201d (Marina). \n \n\u201c\u2026why should we risk our children unnecessarily, when a single \nvaccine is a viable alternative? I'm not saying I'm not going to \nvaccinate at all - I don't want to put anyone's child at risk- I'm \nnot implying that a sick child is less important. But why should \nwe be railroaded into taking a risk we are unhappy \nwith\u2026?(Emmy). \n \nNot all the participants who expressed concerns about MMR regarded single \nvaccines as an appropriate alternative. A few were sceptical about the effectiveness \nof vaccines and the notion of herd immunity. They saw no reason to risk vaccinating \ntheir own children because they were not convinced it would benefit others. For \nthese parents, discussions about social responsibility to be vaccinated were \nirrelevant: \n \n\u201cSorry but I don\u2019t believe in vaccinating one child for the sake of \nothers. There is no proof that it actually works\u2026outbreaks will \nalways occur no matter how many children are vaccinated\u201d (Lill). \n 17  \n \u201cMy fear is that we really have no idea of the long-term impact of \nmass immunisation programmes and their possible consequences in \nterms of indestructible \u2018super-viruses\u2019\u201d (Faith).  \n \n\u201cIf your health visitor is correct [in her belief that vaccination has \nresulted in the increase of various childhood diseases] we should be asking \nexactly what good are we doing the community\u2026there is a body of \nresearch out there which throws doubt on the efficacy of routine \nimmunisation programmes for healthy children \u201d (Lill). \n \nIn summary, single vaccines were widely discussed, often as a means to avoid \nany potential risks from MMR but still protect their own children and others \nfrom disease. \n \nSociety\u2019s responsibility to individuals who are harmed by vaccination \nDiscussion about parents\u2019 obligations to accept some kind of responsibility to society \nand get their healthy children vaccinated for the sake of others led some participants \nto introduce the issue of society\u2019s responsibility to individuals who were harmed by \nvaccination. One participant contrasted the concern expressed about ensuring that \n\u2018vulnerable\u2019 children did not contract diseases with the lower priority given to \n 18  \nprotecting \u2018vulnerable\u2019 children from potential vaccine damage and to care for \nautistic children: \n \n\u201cOh god Gracie- swap places with me then- YOU can have the \nautistic child- and then carry on about social responsibility- \nwhere's the social responsibility to my child? I've been told today \nthat his one-to-one funding at nursery\u2026 is about to be halved as \nthere's another little boy with communication difficulties at his \nnursery and there isn't enough money to fund both\u2026Forgive me if I \ndon't want to expose my normally developing [younger son] to a \npossible increased risk of autism\u2026 the words \"social responsibility\" \nfrom someone who has absolutely no idea what daily life is like with \nautism is like a red rag to a bull\u201d (Jimjams). \n \nParticipants discussed the idea that if wider societal considerations are to be \nconsidered, then the Government should ensure that vaccine damage is more \nconsistently recognised and that the people affected are appropriately compensated.   \nSeveral queried the effectiveness of vaccine safety monitoring or compensation \nschemes because they believed that health professionals were generally reluctant to \nacknowledge and report potential vaccine adverse reactions. For example: \n \n 19  \n\u201cA friend of mine's daughter recently got whooping cough despite \nbeing fully vaccinated. She had every symptom of the disease\u2026 but \nher GP refused to accept it could be whooping cough 'because she \nhad been vaccinated.\u2019 So I suppose she never appeared on any \nofficial statistics\u2026I\u2019m not anti-vaccination, but how can the \ngovernment assess the efficacy of vaccination if doctors are \nreluctant to diagnose an illness after vaccination?\u201d (aloha). \n \nOthers alluded to more general difficulties: \n\u201c[Government] should make it a damn sight easier for the small \npercentage of people damaged to get compensation \u2013 and this \napplies to all vaccines\u201d (Willow2).  \n \nIn summary there was a concern to ensure that the concept of social responsibility \nwas extended to support those adversely affected by vaccination as well as used to \npromote uptake of vaccination.  \n \nDiscussion \nThis study provides an example of using an online chat forum to provide insight \ninto public concerns and views about topical health issues. We examined an online \ndiscussion about the MMR vaccine and found extensive consideration of social \nresponsibility relating to this. Far from regarding childhood immunisation as a \npurely private issue, parents were aware and concerned about the implications for \n 20  \nthe wider community of choosing not to immunise their own children. Avoiding \nharm to others and contributing to the \u2018herd immunity\u2019 of the population were \nimportant considerations for many parents in their decisions about the MMR \nvaccine. They did not override considerations of their own children\u2019s health and \nsafety, but the postings on Mumsnet suggested that parents were keen to act in \nsocially considerate ways as long as the risk to their own child seemed \nproportionate.  \n \nParents differentiated between \u2018healthy\u2019 and \u2018vulnerable\u2019 children and many \nparticipants with healthy children talked of having a responsibility to get them \nvaccinated in order to help avoid epidemics that could be particularly dangerous for \nthose who were more vulnerable. Some were very critical of parents who chose not \nto vaccinate their healthy children. Some participants who had strong concerns \nabout the safety of the MMR vaccine saw single vaccines as an alternative means of \nboth protecting their own children and acting responsibly for the sake of others.  \n \nHowever, support for the concept of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 was not universal. A few \nparents questioned the notion because they were not convinced about vaccine \neffectiveness. A further point was made that if parents were expected to act for the \nbenefit of society as a whole, more should be done to acknowledge and compensate \nthe minority who are harmed by vaccines.  \n \n \n 21  \nProtecting their own children and contributing to the protection of others \nIn the context of concerns about MMR, Mumsnet participants seemed inclined to act \nin ways that both (a) protected their own child and (b) contributed to the protection \nof others. This finding contrasts with the findings of some previous studies (e.g \nCassiday 2007; Poltorak et al 2005; Health Education Board for Soctland 2001; Rogers \nand Pilgrim 1995) which have reported discussions about herd immunity but \nsuggested that notions of social duty or responsibility were less important to \nparents\u2019 vaccination decisions than appeared to be the case in our own study.  Their \nfindings suggested that parental decision-making about whether to vaccinate or not \ntended to be influenced more by perceptions of the personal risks facing their own \nchildren than by any sense of social duty to vaccinate. For example, Poltorak et al \n(2005) found that parental reflections on, and approaches to, vaccination were \nguided by highly personalised assessments of a particular child\u2019s vulnerabilities to \ndisease and vaccination, and that  public health framings that highlight the \nimplications of  individual decisions about vaccinations for others \u201chave little \nresonance\u201d with these (p717). Casiday (2007) reported that parents who expressed \nconcerns about MMR safety \u201cclearly resisted the notion that their children should \nassume this risk in order to help protect others from infection\u201d (p1066).  \n \nHowever, other authors have also found that wider social considerations, as well as \nconsiderations of their own children\u2019s health, are highly relevant to parents\u2019 \ndecisions about MMR. For example, Hobson-West (2003) discussed the importance \nof arguments about herd immunity, and in a survey of 452 UK parents, Cassell et al \n 22  \n(2006) found that 60% of both MMR compliers and non-compliers gave positive \nanswers to the question \u201cwhen deciding about MMR\u2026did you consider possible \nbenefits to other children?\u201d.   \n \nThe fact that the issue of avoiding harm to others was a more prominent theme in \nour study than in previous studies may be explained in part by the fact that the \nmajority of parents in our sample were generally supportive of childhood \nvaccination. Some other studies have focussed primarily on parents who were \nquestioning of vaccination more generally.  For example, Rogers and Pilgrim (1995) \nstudied parents who had refused all vaccinations for their children. When discussing \nthe implications for others of their decision not to vaccinate their own children with \nMMR, these parents dismissed arguments about vaccinating to promote herd \nimmunity as irrelevant because they viewed catching diseases in childhood as a \nmeans of ensuring natural, life-long immunity. Rogers and Pilgrim concluded that \nhealth promoters and dissenting parents expressed \u201cdiametrically opposed \npositions\u201d when it came to the question of whether unvaccinated children were a \nhealth risk to themselves and others (Rogers and Pilgrim 1995, p. 85).  \n \nOur study findings have shed light on the ways in which parents attempt to \nintegrate considerations about societal good with their primary concern for the \nwelfare of their own children.  They do this in part by making a distinction between \n\u2018healthy\u2019 or potentially \u2018vulnerable\u2019 children and using this as a basis for judgements \nabout who should appropriately bear the burden of vaccination and who can \n 23  \nreasonably and fairly rely on others to contribute to the herd immunity that they \nmight benefit from.  \n \nThe \u2018healthy\u2019 and the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 \nIn our study, parents expressed opinions about the strength of their own child\u2019s \nimmune system and his or her vulnerability to both disease and potential vaccine \ndamage based on beliefs relating to hereditary 'weaknesses' towards allergies, \nand\/or auto- immune conditions which could render them vulnerable to vaccine \ndamage. These beliefs influenced decisions for and against accepting the MMR \nvaccination. \n \nThe notion of personal vulnerability to illness has been recognised in previous \nstudies exploring parental views about MMR (e.g. Poltorak et al., 2005; Casiday, \n2007; Cassell et al., 2006) as well as in the broader literature exploring lay \nunderstandings of illness and risk perceptions (e.g. Blaxter, 1983; Pill and Stott 1982; \nCunningham-Burley, 1990; Olin Lauritzen, 2004).  However, while authors such as \nPoltorak et al (2005) have argued that parents\u2019 personalised assessments of their own \nchild\u2019s vulnerabilities guided their decision-making about vaccination to the extent \nthat encouragement to consider the implications of their decisions for other children \nwould not resonate for them, we found that parents\u2019 distinctions between \u2018healthy\u2019 \nand \u2018vulnerable\u2019 children could have important implications for their views about \nsocial responsibility to be vaccinated. These distinctions formed the basis for \njudgements not just about who needed protecting but also about who should bear \n 24  \nthe burden of vaccinating.  A similar observation has been made in a recent \nexploration of the activities and discourses of contemporary organised \u2018vaccine \ncritical groups\u2019.  Hobson-West (2007) found that parents who belonged to groups \nthat were generally supportive of vaccination but expressed some concerns about \nthe potential dangers of specific vaccines made distinctions between children they \nperceived to be \u2018healthy\u2019 and children they perceived to have \u2018immune fragility\u2019 \n(p.206) Some of these parents advocated the development of a test that could \nestablish which group a child belonged to and thus inform decisions about vaccine \nuptake. Hobson-West suggests \u201cthis represents a technical solution to the problem of \nrisk by breaking down the population into several populations with different \ntreatment needs\u201d (2007, p206). However, it is important to note that the criteria that \nparents use to assess fitness for vaccination may not correspond with those currently \nused in official vaccination programmes.  \n \nCriticisms of others within the discussion forum \nIn the \u2018Mumsnet\u2019 discussions, people who chose not to immunise their healthy child \nagainst measles, mumps and rubella (as opposed to those who chose single vaccines \nover MMR, or those who did not vaccinate a child who was particularly vulnerable \nto adverse reactions) came in for a fair amount of criticism.  \n \n \nInternet support groups are generally considered friendly, non-judgemental spaces \nfor exchanging support and information. The sociological literature on internet \nsupport groups has consistently emphasised their functions of support, information \n 25  \nand empowerment (Sharf 1997; Finn 1999). Overall, the \u2018Mumsnet\u2019 website was a \nfriendly non-judgemental space where support and information was exhanged. \nHowever, as Rier\u2019s 2007 analysis of an HIV\/AIDS discussion forum highlighted, \nthese sites can also be significant in terms of debating moral dilemmas and \nattempting to influence offline conduct (Rier 2007).   \n \nOn Mumsnet, the question of social responsibility to be vaccinated was hotly \ndebated and parents were very judgemental at times. There was also evidence of \nattempts to influence the behaviour of others, particularly to persuade group \nmembers to get their \u2018healthy\u2019 children vaccinated to avoid harming others.   \n \nA few studies that have used focus group discussions have also found that \ndiscussion sometimes became hostile when the topic of so-called \u2018free-riders\u2019 was \nraised (e.g. Petts and Niemeyer, 2004., Richardson 2005). However, others have \nreported that most parents were uncritical of those who had decided not to \nimmunise their child (Evans et al, 2001). Sampling issues might again go some way \nto explain these differences in findings. For example, the parents interviewed in the \nstudy by Evans et al (2001) included several who had refused all immunisation for \ntheir children as well as a significant number of MMR \u2018refusers\u2019. The studies \n(including our own) that have reported the significance of discussions around social \nresponsibility have included higher proportions of parents who were generally \nsupportive of vaccination and who have accepted MMR.  \n \n 26  \nImplications for official information about vaccination \nPolicies of mass childhood immunisation are driven by population concerns. The \nobjective of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 requires high rates of uptake, which in turn requires \nthat parents accept recommended vaccines. This is not easily reconciled with \npolicies, in the UK and elsewhere, that encourage individual patient choice and \npersonal involvement in many health care decisions (Blume 2006; Hobson-West \n2003). These policies perhaps explain why promotional information leaflets about \nMMR tend to avoid discussion of social responsibility and concentrate instead on \nindividual benefits and risks in an attempt to convince parents of MMR effectiveness \nand safety (Hobson-West 2003; see e.g. \nhttp:\/\/www.mmrthefacts.nhs.uk\/basics\/truths.php).  \n \nThe potential effectiveness and acceptability of including explanations about herd \nimmunity in information leaflets for parents, and of encouraging patients to consider \nothers when deciding about vaccination for their own children, are unclear. Some \nauthors have suggested that appeals to parents\u2019 wider societal responsibilities are \nunlikely to be effective as a means of promoting vaccination because decisions about \nvaccination are more strongly influenced by perceptions of the risks to their own \nchildren than by considerations of others (e.g. Poltorak et al 2005; HEBS, 2001; \nCasiday, 2007).  However, one survey found that 67.3% of those who had and 37.4% \nof those who had not accepted MMR answered \u201cYes\u201d when asked \u201cIs it right for \nhealth professionals to advise parents to have their child vaccinated for the benefit of \nother children?\u201d (Cassell, et al 2006).  \n 27  \n Parents contributing to Mumsnet got information about various aspects of the MMR \ndebate from a range of sources. They did not discuss in any detail how herd \nimmunity arguments were presented in official literature - perhaps because such \npresentations were generally absent or minimal. Only one participant mentioned in \na somewhat critical way the tendency for the government to put the interests of \n'society' before the interests of the individual. Some participants could be said to \nhave been taking on a public health role as their postings tended to \u2018police\u2019 and \nencourage other parents to choose vaccination for the benefit of others.  \n \nOur study suggests that carefully presented information about the implications of \nindividual parents\u2019 decisions for other people might help support vaccine uptake in \nsome groups.  Appeals to the concept of herd immunity and perhaps moral \nobligations to consider others are unlikely to persuade parents who strongly believe \nthat MMR is ineffective or harmful, because they are unlikely to agree to take what \nthey perceive to be a risk with their own child if they do not think it will benefit \nothers. However, well balanced messages that explain that vaccination can be \nbeneficial for others as well as their own children could still be appropriate \u2013 as long \nas they do not cross the boundary between ethically acceptable attempts to persuade \non the basis of appeals to reason and ethically dubious attempts to manipulate \npeople by playing on their emotions. Such messages would probably need to \nacknowledge that some vulnerable children cannot be vaccinated for health reasons.  \n \n 28  \nOur findings will be of interest to debates about public health ethics that have \nfocussed on arguments about moral obligations in relation to vaccination \nprogrammes (e.g. Dawson, 2006). They also suggest that social scientists with an \ninterest in attitudes and behaviours relating to vaccination should attend carefully to \nlay understandings of herd immunity as a public good and views about obligations \nto others in society. Further investigation is needed of the lay distinction between \n\u2018healthy\u2019 and more \u2018vulnerable\u2019 members of society and the implications of this for \nvaccination policy and practice. Differences between lay understandings of what \nrenders children susceptible to vaccine damage and conventional medical views \nabout contraindications for vaccination will warrant particular attention. .  \n \nStrengths of our study \nOur study used a searchable online discussion forum with over one hundred \ncontributors as a primary data source. This allowed us to explore the types of \nquestions and issues about MMR that parents generated in discussions among \nthemselves rather than in response to researchers\u2019 questioning strategies. It also \nallowed us to observe how different positions were argued and negotiated, and how \nsome parents attempted to influence others. \n \nLimitations of our study \nWe analysed messages posted to only one website, and participants were probably \nnot demographically representative of the wider population. They all had Internet \naccess, a few referred to themselves as scientists, and several engaged in fairly \n 29  \nsophisticated discussions about the scientific evidence for and against an MMR-\nautism link. Also, a higher proportion of participants had refused MMR than was \nthe case in the general population.  \n \nAll these factors raise legitimate questions about the ways in which it is and is not \nappropriate to generalise from our findings to the wider parent population, and \nabout whether and how insights from this study should inform future \ncommunications about MMR or vaccination more generally.  \n \nWe cannot make any claims about the distribution of views across the broader \npopulation. However, we were able to identify concerns that at least some parents \nhad about the MMR vaccine and we were able to identify ways in which at least some \nparents (particularly among those with concerns about MMR) discussed the social \nimplications of not immunising.  Also, because our sample included parents who \nquestioned the safety of MMR, requested single vaccines, and felt that their \nquestions were not being answered adequately by government representatives, it \ncontains important insights for efforts to improve vaccination uptake rates. \n \nAlthough our data collection ended in 2003 and the climate of opinion about MMR \nmay have shifted to some extent with publicity about the General Medical Council\u2019s \nhearing relating to Andrew Wakefield (BBC news 2006), it seems likely that some \npublic concern remains, and the kinds of insight we have identified in relation to \nMMR are likely to be relevant as concerns about other vaccines emerge in the future.  \n 30  \n When analysing message postings to an online discussion forum, the sample and \ndata are both given. There is no scope to modify either and there are limited \nopportunities to verify either the characteristics of participants or the intended \nmeanings of what was said. Some sample characteristics can be gleaned from \nmessage postings, and in this case, analysis of the two discussion threads that we \nfocussed on and a brief investigation of other threads in which participants had \nposted messages suggested that participants were consistent in terms of the \ninformation they provided about themselves and the views they expressed on \nparticular issues. Furthermore, although we as researchers could not probe what \nparticipants were saying, it was not uncommon for participants to check each others\u2019 \nmeaning or ask for clarification about other people\u2019s opinions. It is, of course, \npossible that parents sought in their postings to present themselves in a positive \nlight. We accept that although the issue of social responsibility was widely discussed \nwe can only speculate that it was an important consideration for actual vaccine \ndecision-making.  In other words, we cannot verify the actions or motivations that \nMumsnet participants reported. However, it seems unlikely that social desirability \nconsiderations would have an unduly strong influence over what people say in the \ncontext of an online forum in which participants use pseudonyms.  \n \nConclusions \nOur investigation of parents\u2019 discussions about the MMR vaccine suggests the \nsalience of social responsibility considerations for their decisions about vaccination.  \n 31  \nIt has also shown how judgements about the appropriate distribution of social \nresponsibility for vaccination are shaped by beliefs about the health status of \nindividual children and their susceptibility to any potential harms from vaccination.   \n \nOur findings suggest it might be appropriate for vaccine promotional material to \ninclude explanations of herd immunity and ensure parents are aware of the potential \npublic health implications of their individual decisions. However, attention should \nbe paid to the distinction parents make between healthy and vulnerable children \nand, as other authors have argued, there is a need for immunisation information to \nacknowledge and address these lay concepts of immunity (e.g. Poltorak, et al 2005;  \nCassell, et al 2006) even if these concepts are at odds with the views held by the \nmedical profession and Department of Health. Policy makers should also strive to be \nmore explicit about what is being done to provide practical support to those harmed \nby vaccines.  \n \nReferences \nBlaxter, M. (1983).
