INTRODUCTION\nWHEN digital filters are implemented, they are imple-mented with finite precision due to the finite wordlength\n(FWL) of the representation of numbers within the computing\nmachine. There are two FWL effects. The first is the addition of\nnoise into the system resulting from the rounding of variables\nbefore and after each arithmetic operation\u2014the \u201croundoff\nnoise.\u201d The second is the degradation in the performance\nand\/or the stability resulting from rounding of the filter coef-\nficients\u2014the \u201ccoefficient sensitivity.\u201d The FWL problem is\nhence to analyze the effects to ensure that they do not cause\nsignificant deterioration in the performance of an implemented\nfilter. The effects are obviously dependent upon the chosen\nwordlength and on the chosen arithmetic format (floating-point,\nfixed-point, etc.). Slightly less obvious is the fact that the FWL\neffects are very dependent upon the particular realization,\n(direct form, cascade, etc.), and upon the chosen operator (shift\noperator, operator, etc.). Thus, in seeking to alleviate the FWL\neffects, the realization must also be considered.\nThe FWL effects have been studied for many years. Although\nmany of the early works were motivated by problems in control\nsystems [1], [2], the analysis of the effects were often considered\nin the open loop. See [3] for a comprehensive review of early\nwork. Further reviews can be found in [4]\u2013[6]. There has been\na large amount of work that considers the problem of roundoff\nManuscript received July 10, 2006; revised November 27, 2006. This paper\nwas recommended by Associate Editor T.

Solutions for other similar measures can\nbe found in [5], [15] and further developed in, for example,\n[16]\u2013[18]. A related measure using a statistical analysis of\nthe input\u2013output sensitivity has been developed [19]. An ex-\ntension to the multivariable system case is provided in [20].\nThe closed-loop control case has also been considered, for\nexample in [21]. Methods for the simultaneous minimization\nof a sensitivity measure with roundoff noise [22] and subject to\nscaling requirements [23] have also been developed recently.\nThe sensitivity of the poles (and zeros) is also a commonly\nused measure of the coefficient rounding effect. An early anal-\nysis appears in [24]. Mantey [25] showed that the poles\/eigen-\nvalues are dependent on the state-space realization. It is well-\nknown that an eigenvalue sensitivity is minimized if the system\nis normal [26]. However Gevers and Li [5] subsequently de-\ntermined the realization that would minimize a pole sensitivity\nmeasure combined with a zero sensitivity measure proposed in\n[27]. Much subsequent work (see [28]\u2013[31], for example) has\nconsidered various similar eigenvalue sensitivity measures for\nclosed-loop control systems.\nMost of the significant results have expressed the filter in the\nstate space form. Although most realizations can be transformed\ninto the state-space form, this form is not completely general\nand has several limitations. Firstly, the analysis of the rounding\neffect of a specific coefficient in a particular realization form\ncan become very difficult after transformation to the state space\nform. Secondly, many realization forms require the computa-\ntion of intermediate variables that cannot be expressed in the\nstate-space form. Furthermore, the state space form is specific\nto the chosen operator. In reality all implementable operators\nare actually implemented using the shift operator. For example,\na realization expressed in the form of a -operator is actually\nimplemented using a shift operator in combination with an in-\ntermediate variable.\nThus, a description that includes intermediate variables is re-\nquired. This paper proposes a particular implicit state-space de-\nscription that is not subject to these limitations. The proposed\nspecialized implicit form provides a generalized description of\nany realization in a form that allows a straightforward analysis\nof the FWL effects as will be shown later in this paper. The\ndescription is macroscopic in that it does not require coding\n1549-8328\/$25.00 \u00a9 2007 IEEE\n1766 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS\u2014I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 54, NO. 8, AUGUST 2007\ndetails and is platform independent but gives a direct relation-\nship between the description and the implementation algorithm.\nNote that the idea of representing the intermediate variables in\nthe description has been considered previously [32] (see also\n[33], [34]), but the description form is less general than the im-\nplicit form considered in this paper. For example, -realizations\ncannot be described using this form.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the spe-\ncialized implicit form is proposed, and a number of definitions\ngiven. The idea of a set of structured realizations, or structura-\ntion is introduced and several examples of structurations pro-\nvided. In Section III, the equivalence classes of a realization in\nthe specialized implicit form are provided. This is necessary to\nenable the determination of realizations that are relatively im-\npervious to FWL effects. In Section IV, several coefficient sen-\nsitivity measures are proposed for use with the specialized im-\nplicit form. Some examples are given in Section V. Note that\nalthough the emphasis in this paper is on the coefficient sensi-\ntivity problem, the proposed implicit form can be just as useful\nto the analysis and solution of the roundoff noise problem, and\nthis will be done in future works.\nII. UNIFYING FRAMEWORK\nA. Specialized Implicit Form\nTo show the utility of the implicit realization, we consider an\nexample of the implementation of a -operator state-space real-\nization. It is well-known [5], [35], [36] that the -operator is nu-\nmerically superior to the usual shift operator generally resulting\nin less sensitive implementations with less rounding noise.\nFor a realization expressed with the -operator, the input\/\noutput relation is\n(1)\nwith , where is a strictly positive constant and\nis the delay operator [5]. This is equivalent, in infinite precision,\nto the classical state-space realization\n(2)\nwith , , and .\nWith these two equivalent realizations, the parametrization is\ndifferent, therefore when the parameters are subjected to FWL\nrounding, the two realizations are no longer equivalent, and the\nimpact of the quantization is different. In addition, in order to\nimplement the -operator, intermediate variables are necessary.\nThese are also subject to FWL quantization. So the following\nalgorithm:\n(3)\nimplements (1) where is an intermediate variable vector.\nThere are many other possible implementation forms, such\nas direct form I or II, cascade\/parallel decomposition, lattice fil-\nters, mixed , etc., and many of these also require interme-\ndiate variables. In order to consider all of them within a general\nunifying framework, we propose a description, in a single equa-\ntion, of the filter implementation. The equation provides an ex-\nplicit description of the parametrization, and allows the analysis\nof the FWL effects, but is still a macroscopic description. Fur-\nthermore, the description is given within a formalism such that\nthe description takes the form of an implicit state-space system.\nThis specialized implicit form is given by\n(4)\nwhere the following are true.\n\u2022 , , , , ,\n, , , ,\n, , and .\n\u2022 Matrix is lower triangular with 1\u2019s on the diagonal, i.e.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(5)\n\u2022 is the intermediate variable in the calculations\nof step (the column of 0\u2019s in the second matrix shows\nthat is not used for the calculation at step \u2014this\ncharacterizes the concept of an intermediate variable).\n\u2022 is the stored state-vector ( is effectively\nstored from one step to the next, in order to compute\nat step ).\nand form the descriptor-vector:\nis stored from one step to the next, while is computed\nand used within one time step.\nIt is implicitly assumed throughout the paper that the com-\nputations associated with the realization (4) are executed in row\norder giving the following algorithm:\n[i]\n[ii]\n[iii]\nNote that in practice, steps [ii] and [iii] could be exchanged to\nreduce the computational delay. Also note that because the com-\nputations are executed in row order and is lower triangular\nwith 1\u2019s on the diagonal, there is no need to compute . The\nexample in Section V-B shows how to exploit this particularity\nthat gives an extra degree of freedom (49).\nThis form is a special case of the generalized implicit form\n[37]\n(6)\nbut it is not singular. Equation (4) is equivalent in infinite preci-\nsion to the classical state-space form\n(7)\nHILAIRE et al.: UNIFYING FRAMEWORK FOR FWL REALIZATIONS 1767\nwith , , and where\n(8)\n(9)\nNote that (7) corresponds to a different parametrization than (4).\nThe system transfer function is given by\n(10)\nB. Definitions\nTo complete the framework, the following definitions are re-\nquired.\nDefinition 1: A realization, , is defined by the specific set\nof matrices , , , , , , , , and used to describe a\nrealization with the implicit form of (4):\n(11)\nRemark 1: can also be defined by the matrix\n(12)\nand the dimensions , , and , so could be defined by\n.\nDefinition 2: denotes the set of realizations with transfer\nfunction . These realizations are said to be equivalent.\nIn order to encompass realizations with some special struc-\nture ( -operator state-space, -operator state-space, direct form,\ncascade, lattice filters, etc.), we define a set of realizations that\npossess a particular structure.\nDefinition 3: A structuration1 is a set of realizations\nhaving a common structure: some coefficients or some dimen-\nsions are fixed a priori.\nSome examples of common structurations are given in the\nnext section.\nDefinition 4: is the set of equivalent structured realiza-\ntions. Realizations from are structured according to and\nhave a transfer function . Hence, .\nDefinition 5: A parametrization of a realization is the set\nof coefficients of that are significant for the realization.\nFor example, with the -operator state-space realization of\n(2), the parametrization is given by the matrices , ,\nand . But for the -operator state-space realization of (1), the\nparametrization is given by the matrices , , , and the\nparameter . We will see in the next section that the -operator\nstate-space realization includes some additional parameters that\nare always set to unity or zero. These are not \u2018significant coef-\nficients\u2019 and hence are not included in the parametrization.\n1This is a useful French word that we have purloined. It is also used in the\nfield of social sciences. Here it means the set of structured realizations.\nFig. 1. Cascade form.\nC. Some Examples\nThe -realization given by (1) is equivalent, in both finite and\ninfinite precision, to algorithm (3). So this corresponds to the\nfollowing specialized implicit form:\n(13)\nSo, the -structuration is formally defined by\n(14)\nThe cascade form is a common realization for filter imple-\nmentation. It generally has good FWL properties compared to\nthe direct forms. For cascade form, the filter is decomposed\ninto a number of lower order (usually first- and second-order)\ntransfer function blocks connected in series. For the next ex-\nample, we consider two standard -operator filter blocks con-\nnected in series as shown in Fig. 1.\nIf the two state-space realizations and are defined\nby and , then cascading\nwith leads to the following realization:\n(15)\nfrom which definition of the structuration immediately fol-\nlows. The output of is computed in the intermediate vari-\nable, and used as the input of .\nThe main point is that if we consider the equivalent state-\nspace realization, with parameters\n(16)\nthe parametrization is not the one used in the computations.\nRemark 2: The cascade structuration can be easily extended\nto a series of specialized implicit forms and to general multiple\ncascaded systems.\nFor a given form, it is generally straightforward to define the\nstructuration. A number of other examples are given in [38] and\n[39].\n1768 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS\u2014I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 54, NO. 8, AUGUST 2007\nIII. EQUIVALENT CLASSES\nIn order to exploit the potential offered by the specialized\nimplicit form in improving implementations, it is necessary, to\ndescribe sets of equivalent system realizations. However, non-\nminimal realizations may provide better implementations (the\n-form can be seen as a nonminimal realization when expressed\nin the implicit state-space form with the shift operator. Hence,\nthe notion of equivalence needs to be extended so that the system\nstate dimension does not need to be preserved. The Inclusion\nPrinciple, introduced by \u02c7Siljak and Ikeda [40], [41] in the con-\ntext of decentralized control, is useful here as it allows the for-\nmalization of the equivalence and inclusion relations between\ntwo system realizations.\nDefinition 6: Consider two systems and , with state di-\nmension and respectively, described in classical state-\nspace form by matrices , , ,\n, and . System is said to\nbe included in system (denoted by ) if there exists\nsuch that and, for any initial\nstate of and any input , the choice of\nthe initial state of implies\n(17)\nRemark 3: Equation (17) implies that system contains all\nthe necessary information to describe the behavior of .\nThe principle is extended here to the specialized implicit form\nin order to characterize equivalence classes. An equivalence\nclass is defined by a certain minimal realization and all the re-\nalizations that include this realization. They can be built using\nthe following proposition:\nProposition 1: Consider a realization\nwith dimensions .\nA realization that includes can be constructed as follows.\n\u2022 Choose and such that .\n\u2022 Choose such that ,\nsuch that and\nsuch that .\n\u2022 Choose complementary matrices2 ,\n, , , ,\n, , and\nsuch that, if we denote ,\n, , ,\n, , ,\n, and,\nthen , ,\n,\nand are satisfied.\n2These matrices are called complementary matrices.M is complementary\nin that it fills the gap between ~X and the similarity onX : ~X = T XT +M .\nIf so, the realization in-\ncludes the realization .\nProof: The proof can be derived directly from the charac-\nterization of the Inclusion Principle [40], [42], [43]. The details\nare omitted here but can be found in [38].\nAlthough this proposition gives the formal description of\nequivalent classes, it is of practical interest to consider real-\nizations of the same dimensions ( and ) where\ntransformations from one realization to another is only a simi-\nlarity transformation.\nProposition 2: Consider a realization .\nAll the realizations with\n(18)\nand , , are nonsingular matrices, are equivalent to .\nIt is also possible to just consider a subset of similarity trans-\nformations that preserve a particular structure, say cascade or\ndelta. For example, if an initial -structured realization\nis given, the subset of equivalent -structured\nrealization is defined by\nnonsingular\n(19)\nIn addition to a description of the various existing realizations\nwith the exact parametrization, this formalism gives an algebraic\ncharacterization of equivalent classes. These classes can be used\nto search for an optimal structured realization (see Section V-A).\nIV. SENSITIVITY MEASURES\nIn order to be able to accurately assess the suitability of a par-\nticular realization in the specialized implicit form, some mea-\nsure of the coefficient sensitivity are required. The measures\nneed to be computationally tractable but also need to account\nfor the fact that common structured realizations (e.g., ) contain\nmany coefficients that are either zero or unity and hence do not\ncontribute to the FWL effects. Such coefficients are known as\ntrivial parameters. Furthermore, it is useful if the measures can\ntake into account the choice of arithmetic format (floating point\nor fixed point) of the coefficients\u2019 representation.\nA. Coefficient Quantization\nA coefficient\u2019s quantization depends both on their value and\ntheir representation.\nFirstly if the value of a coefficient is such that it will be\nquantized without error, then that parameter makes no contribu-\ntion to the overall coefficient sensitivity. Hence, we introduce\nweighting matrices to (and also ) respectively as-\nsociated with matrices to of a realization, such that\nif is exactly implemented\notherwise. (20)\nHILAIRE et al.: UNIFYING FRAMEWORK FOR FWL REALIZATIONS 1769\nSecondly, different representation schemes may be considered.\nHere, we consider both fixed-point and floating-point represen-\ntations of coefficients expressed using bits.\nA fixed-point coefficient is represented by ,\nwhere , is an integer coded with bits and an\ninteger (not stored in the representation) such that\n. The quantized of is such that .\nA floating-point coefficient is represented by\nwhere (or for a normalized floating-point\nrepresentation) and is an integer coded with bits3\n. The quantized of is, in this\ncase, such that .\nThe choice of and can be unique for each coefficient\n( and , where is\nthe ceiling operator). Alternatively, and are defined for a\ngroup of coefficients (in order to reduce the required bit-shifts\nand the subsequent computational cost). This defines the block-\nfixed-point and block-floating-point schemes. Following [44],\nwe introduce the generalized dynamic range bit (\nor ) and the precision bit length ( or ).\nUsually, the blocks used in block-representation correspond\nto the matrices to , but there is no necessity for this, and\nblocks can be chosen at will. To define the blocks of a realization\n, we introduce the matrix such that\nthe largest absolute value of\nthe block in which resides (21)\nThis allows a completely general definition of the blocks.\nThus, there could be just a single unique block, or every block\ncould consist of only one coefficient. For example, denoting\nas a matrix of 1\u2019s and\n(22)\nthen using a block-representation corresponding to the matrices\nto gives\nWith a single unique block for we get\n, and for one block per coeffi-\ncient we get .\nProposition 3: During the quantization process, is per-\nturbed to where\nfor fixed-point representation\nfor floating-point representation (23)\nis a matrix dependant on the precision bit length, and\ndenotes the Schur product. If is the precision bit-length of\n, then .\nRemark 4: With this formalism for the different representa-\ntion schemes, note that the choice of the scale parameter ( or\n) is defined for each coefficient ( and\n3The difference with fixed-point is that e is coded with \f bits and can be\nchanged. With fixed-point, \f is fixed and implicit.\n) and that it is also possible to de-\nfine the minimum bit length to code each coefficient without\noverflow or underflow [38].\nB. Transfer Function Sensitivity Measure\nThe sensitivity measure proposed here extends the measure\nproposed by Gevers and Li [5] to the specialized implicit state-\nspace form as well as accounting for trivial parameters and the\ncoefficient representation.\nLet denote the transfer function per-\nturbed by the quantization process. Then, in the single-input\nsingle-output (SISO) case, :\n(24)\nThen\n(25)\nwhere is the -norm. It is easy to see that\n(26)\nand so (25) leads to the following transfer function sensitivity\nmeasure:\nDefinition 7 (SISO Transfer Function Sensitivity): Consider\na realization with an associated matrix .\nThe sensitivity of the realization\u2019s transfer function with re-\nspect to all the nontrivial coefficients of , is defined in the\nSISO case by\n(27)\nRemark 5: The measure differs from the measure pro-\nposed by Gevers and Li [5] for SISO classical state-space fixed-\npoint realizations which is defined by\n(28)\nFor the definition of , the term is ignored\nbecause it is invariant to the possible realization. However, for\nthe specialized implicit form, and so the sen-\nsitivity of the direct feed-through term, , is dependent\non the realization.\nThis measure can be extended to the multiple-input multiple\noutput (MIMO) case. However it is also useful to be able to con-\nsider the contribution of each coefficient to the overall sensi-\ntivity. The transfer function sensitivity matrix, denoted by ,\nis the matrix of the -norm of the sensitivity of the transfer\nfunction with respect to each coefficient . It is defined by\n(29)\n1770 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS\u2014I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 54, NO. 8, AUGUST 2007\nand allows the evaluation of the overall impact of each coeffi-\ncient. It can be used to evaluate the overall sensitivity. From the\nproperties of the -norm, we have\n(30)\nwhere is the Frobenius norm.\nDefinition 8: The MIMO transfer function sensitivity is de-\nfined by\n(31)\nNext, we introduce a new operator that simplifies the subse-\nquent expressions for and the transfer function sensitivity\nmatrix.\nDefinition 9: The operator is defined by\n(32)\nwhere and and where is the\nclassical operator that transforms a matrix to a column vector.\nSo .\nLemma 1: Consider two matrices (or transfer functions),\nand , that are assumed to be independent of a\nmatrix . Then\n(33)\nand\n(34)\nProof: The proof can be found in [38] and comes from\n(35)\nProposition 4:\n(36)\nwhere\nand the dimensions of the transfer functions to are ,\n, and respectively.\nProof: From the application of Lemma 1 with (8) and (9)\nto (10). Details are given in [38].\nProposition 5: Consider a matrix and three transfer func-\ntion matrices , and of appropriate dimensions such that\n(37)\nThe sensitivity matrix is given by\n(38)\nProof: The proof is straightforward and can be found in\n[38].\nC. Pole Sensitivity Measure\nThe transfer function sensitivity does not explicitly con-\nsider the stability of the system. To ensure that the imple-\nmentation is stable, the sensitivity of the poles needs to be\nconsidered. Let denote the poles of a realization\n. These poles are perturbed during the\nquantization process to with\n(39)\nClearly, this expression provides a means by which the min-\nimum bit-length to preserve stability can be determined a priori.\nThis is explored in [38] and [45].\nWe can define the following pole sensitivity measure.\nDefinition 10: Consider a realization\nand associated quantization description matrix . The pole sen-\nsitivity measure of is defined by\n(40)\nThe following lemma is required prior to providing a means\nof evaluating .\nLemma 2: ([28]) Consider a differentiable function\n, and two matrices and .\nLet , and be constant matrices with appropriate\ndimensions, then the following results hold.\n\u2022 If , then\n\u2022 If , then\nProposition 6:\n(41)\nProof: Apply Lemma 2 to (8).\nThe term can be evaluated using the following\nlemma.\nLemma 3: Let be diagonalisable.

Let de-\nnote the pole sensitivity matrix defined by\n(44)\nThe pole sensitivity measure is then given by\n(45)\nV. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE\nA. Optimal Realization Problem\nThe problem of determining the best realization can be posed\nas follows:\nProblem 1 (Optimal Realization Problem): Consider a\ntransfer function and a sensitivity measure . The optimal\ndesign problem is to find the best realization with transfer\nfunction according to the criteria , that is\n(46)\nDue to the size of , this problem cannot be solved prac-\ntically. Indeed, a solution may even have infinite dimension.\nHence, the following problem is introduced to restrict the search\nto a particular structuration.\nProblem 2 (Optimal Structured Realization Problem): The\nproblem to find the optimal structured realization , that is\n(47)\nThe Inclusion Principle (Propositions 1 and 2) provides\nthe means to search over the structured realizations set .\nSince the measure could be nonsmooth and\/or nonconvex,\nthe Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) [46] method has\nbeen chosen to solve Problem 2. This method has worked\nwell for other optimal realization problems [30]. The resulting\noptimal sensitivities for the measures proposed in Section IV\nare presented next.\nB. Example\nTo illustrate the use of the proposed measures and the optimal\ndesign problem, we consider a sixth-order narrowband low-pass\nfilter from [27] given by\nTABLE I\nMEASURES FOR DIFFERENT REALIZATIONS\n. The poles are\n,\nand (all the computations are\nperformed with double floating-point precision, but the results\nare quoted only to 4 significant digits). The weighting matrix\nis constructed according to (20) (only 0, 1 are considered\nas exactly implemented). Note that the optimizations are per-\nformed using the pole sensitivity measure , but could also be\ndone using the transfer function sensitivity measure or a mixed\nmeasure.\nThe following realizations are considered.\nDirect form II with shift-operator : it corresponds\nto a canonical state-space form: the transfer function\ncoefficients directly appear in .\nBalanced classical state-space realization.\n-optimal classical state-space realization: the set of\nequivalent classical state-space realizations is searched\nusing (48), shown at the bottom of the next page, where\nis one classical state-space realization\nof and is a nonsingular matrix.\n-optimal implicit state-space realization: we consider\nall the equivalent realizations described by (49), shown\nat the bottom of the next page, where is a lower\ntriangular matrix [as for in (5)]. This can be described\nin the implicit state-space framework by (50), shown at\nthe bottom of the next page, and equivalent realizations\ncan be searched with the similarity shown in (51) at\nthe bottom of the next page, where is a nonsingular\nmatrix and is chosen so that is still lower\ntriangular (in practice, the coefficients of the new matrix\nare chosen by the optimization algorithm, and is\nthen deduced).\n-optimal state-space -realization : the\n-structured equivalent set [see (19)] is searched,\nwith an initial realization given as for (13).\nThe values of the sensitivity measures for the various realiza-\ntions are given in Table I. Note that the balanced realization\nhas the best transfer function sensitivity. This is not surprising\nsince it is known that balanced realizations are optimal in an-\nother transfer function sensitivity sense [5]. The pole sensitivity\nof is fairly good, but is not minimal and can be reduced by a\nfactor of 4 by using the state-space realization. However, real-\nizations , and have a poor transfer function sensitivity.\n1772 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS\u2014I: REGULAR PAPERS, VOL. 54, NO. 8, AUGUST 2007\nFig. 2. Transfer function frequency response after quantization (11 bits fixed-\npoint with natural blocks).\nThis is because only pole sensitivity measure has been mini-\nmized. This indicates that minimizing the pole sensitivity alone\nis not good enough for this application, and some weighted com-\nbination of both sensitivities would be preferable.\nFig. 2 shows the a posteriori degradation of the transfer func-\ntion frequency response when implemented in fixed-point, with\nnatural blocks and with 11 bits, for the realizations and\n(compared to the initial transfer function ). It shows the very\npoor sensitivity of the direct form, . This realization is actu-\nally unstable, and in Table II the a posteriori perturbation of the\ntransfer function poles are shown. Poles and are highly\nsensitive for the direct form and have moved onto the real axis.\nTABLE II\nPOLES DISPLACEMENT AFTER QUANTIZATION (11 bits FIXED-POINT WITH\nNATURAL BLOCKS)\nVI. CONCLUSION\nA unifying framework for describing FWL implementations\nis presented. The tools for utilizing this framework to obtain\noptimal realizations are provided. The characterization of the\nequivalent classes provides the means for searching over equiv-\nalent structurations. Previously proposed measures are extended\nto the framework and these enable the coefficient sensitivity to\nbe analyzed and minimized in a unified way. Of course there\nis no guarantee that one particular structuration will result in a\nbetter implementation than another, but the framework allows\nthe systematic comparison of realizations with different struc-\ntures.\nThe problem for closed-loop control systems has been studied\n[38], [47] but there is still further work to be done. Consideration\nof the quantization noise remains, as does consideration of the\nsparseness and the dynamic range. The optimization problem is\nhard, and although the ASA method works well, there are no\nguarantees that the globally optimal realization is found.\n(48)\n=AX(k)+BU(k)\n=CX(k)+DU(k) (49)\n(50)\n(51)\nHILAIRE et al.: UNIFYING FRAMEWORK FOR FWL REALIZATIONS 1773\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.
