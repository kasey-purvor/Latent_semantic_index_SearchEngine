The Convention\nis often lauded as a unique international agreement in terms of integrating hu-\nman rights and environmental protection: Article 1 of the Convention presents\nthe \u201cright of every person of present and future generations to live in an envi-\nronment adequate to his or her health or well-being\u201d as justi\u00aacation for its\nrecognition, in environmental matters, of rights to information access, public\nparticipation and access to justice.2 These Aarhus procedural rights bring corre-\nsponding duties on states. Thus, for citizens\u2019 access to information, there are in-\nformation disclosure obligations on public authorities. Similarly, for citizen\nrights to access to decision-making and justice in environmental matters, the\nConvention sets out associated duties. The effective implementation of all the\nprocedural rights is seen as a condition for realizing the substantive right to an\nadequate level of environmental quality. This claim about the necessary con-\njoining of procedural and substantive environmental rights is also found in the\npreamble to the Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (Kiev Pro-\ntocol), which was adopted at an Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties to the\nAarhus Convention.3 The Kiev Protocol entered into force on 8 October 2009\n* Thanks to Aarti Gupta and fellow participants of the Transparency in Global Environmental Gover-\nnance Workshop at Wageningen University, 23\u201324 April 2009, for feedback on an earlier draft\nof this article.

Indeed, UNECE presents the\nConvention as heralding a more responsive relationship between people and\ngovernments. As will be shown, the agreement has introduced innovative mech-\nanisms for empowering public participation in national and international\ndecision-making, affording a special status to affected publics and nongovern-\nmental organizations (NGOs). This in part re\u00baects the efforts of environmental\nNGOs in lobbying UNECE regarding decision-making entitlements for civil so-\nciety actors\u2014lobbying which found fertile ground in the 1990s in the context of\nexternal democracy promotion within Eastern Europe. Transparency, expressed\nas information access, was deemed to be a necessary expression of, and condi-\ntion for, democratic governance. However, transparency norms in the Aarhus\nConvention have been framed mainly by a market liberal understanding in\nwhich information disclosure obligations fall directly on public authorities and\nonly indirectly steer private sector institutions and actors. As will be argued here,\nthe construction and implementation of Aarhus rights according to this under-\nstanding has weakened the information access rights of citizens and affected\npublics.\nIn this article, I examine the nature and scope of the information disclo-\nsure obligations under the Aarhus Convention. After outlining the development\nof environmental information disclosure provisions by UNECE, I brie\u00bay set out\nthe relevant provisions of the agreement and characterize its construction of in-\nformation disclosure rights. The application of these disclosure rights is then ex-\namined, drawing mainly on materials from the treaty secretariat and Parties to\nthe Convention, but also referring to the perspectives of relevant nonstate ac-\ntors. An analysis of the experience so far of applying Aarhus information rights\npinpoints inherent (unexamined) inconsistencies in Aarhus informational gov-\nernance. These include the discretionary authority accorded to Parties, the exclu-\nsion of private actors from mandatory duties regarding information disclosure,\nand the indeterminate coupling of substantive and procedural rights. Ana-\nlytically, I argue that these inconsistencies re\u00baect a structural imbalance in the\narticulation of Aarhus environmental rights between social welfare and market\nliberal perspectives. While the Convention expresses, in Article 1, a socially just\ncommitment to decent environmental conditions for all, the differential obliga-\ntions placed on public authorities and private actors reveal a more restricted\n(liberal) understanding of rights. The article highlights various manifestations\nof this normative mismatch.\nEnvironmental Information Disclosure and UNECE\nThe drafting of the Aarhus Convention drew on ten years of experience of\nenvironmental agreements within UNECE, as part of the \u201cEnvironment for Eu-\nMichael Mason \u2022 11\nrope\u201d process. While ostensibly a forum for pan-European economic integra-\ntion,4 UNECE has developed a body of international environmental law cover-\ning transboundary aspects of air pollution, environmental impact assessment,\nindustrial accidents and the protection and use of shared watercourses.5 During\nthe East-West d\u00e9tente process of the mid-late 1970s, it was the selection of\ntransboundary air pollution cooperation as a negotiation issue for mutual gain\nthat favored UNECE as an institutional setting for environmental rule-making.6\nFollowing the collapse of communist rule in Eastern Europe, in 1991 UNECE\nco-initiated the Environment for Europe process to promote pan-European en-\nvironmental cooperation. Environment for Europe discussions served as the im-\nmediate backdrop for the two years of negotiations that produced the Aarhus\nConvention, and it was at the Fourth Ministerial Conference (in Aarhus, Den-\nmark in June 1998) under this process that the Convention was adopted.\nAccording to UNECE, the Aarhus Convention was based in part on its ex-\nperience of implementing previous environmental agreements, including the\napplication of information disclosure provisions.7 In an effort to codify these\nvarious entitlements, in 1995 UNECE produced Guidelines on Access to Envi-\nronmental Information and Public Participation in Environmental Decision-\nMaking. The geopolitical context of regime change and independence in former\nWarsaw Pact countries gave an unprecedented opportunity for the Commission\nto set a regional governance agenda that, in the creation of new legal instru-\nments, fused democratic entitlements with environmental protection norms.\nBetween 1990 and 1995, 16 newly independent Central and Eastern European\nstates had joined UNECE and, at least symbolically, were keen to embrace dem-\nocratic values. In October 1995, at the Third Ministerial Conference under the\nEnvironment for Europe umbrella, the participating environment ministers en-\ndorsed the UNECE Guidelines. They also adopted the So\u00aaa Ministerial Declara-\ntion, which called for all countries in the region to ensure that they had an effec-\ntive legal framework to secure public access to environmental information and\npublic participation in environmental decision-making.8\nThus, the ambitious multilateralism of UNECE in regard to the pan-Euro-\npean development of environmental information disclosure cannot be divorced\nfrom its democracy promotion efforts in Central and Eastern Europe. Indeed,\nSecretary-General Ko\u00aa Annan introduced the Aarhus Convention as the most\nambitious venture in \u201cenvironmental democracy\u201d undertaken by the UN.9 From\n1989 both the European Commission and the US funded major governmental\nand nongovernmental capacity-building programs in the former communist\n12 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n4.

These negotiations resulted in the \u00aarst UNECE environmental treaty\u2014The\nConvention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (adopted 13 November 1979; entered\ninto force 16 March 1983).\n7.

Economic Commission for Europe 2000, v.\ncountries, which included the creation in Budapest of a Regional Environmen-\ntal Center for Central and Eastern Europe. In this context of external democracy\npromotion, the development of the Aarhus Convention was notable for the ac-\ntive role of transition countries in shaping its provisions, for these states were al-\nready adopting new environmental information and participation laws with an\nexplicit human rights component.10 It is not surprising, therefore, that Article 1\nof the Convention champions a substantive environmental right\u2014the equal en-\ntitlement of all persons, across generations, to a decent level of environmental\nquality. This represents a strong conception of social welfare, which is compati-\nble, in principle, with socialist and social democratic norms from a range of Eu-\nropean political traditions. It implies regulatory constraints (to a greater or\nlesser degree) on private investment and trade decisions generating signi\u00aacant\nenvironmental harm.\nHowever, the substantive commitment to environmental justice in Article\n1 has been at odds with the aggressive free market restructuring facilitated for\nthe new democracies by multilateral development banks (e.g. European Bank\nfor Reconstruction and Development) and private investment actors. This\nmeans that the UNECE mandate for facilitating European economic develop-\nment\u2014which in the preamble to the Aarhus Convention is interpreted as \u201csus-\ntainable development\u201d\u2014has deferred in practice to a market liberal model of\neconomic development. Thus, the Commission\u2019s commitment to information\ndisclosure as supportive of its core commitment to East-West cooperation has\nmirrored Western economic liberalization and privatization objectives for tran-\nsition countries, which have been set as conditionalities for European Union\nand WTO membership. Within this dominant norm complex of neoliberalism,\ninformation disclosure by governmental and private actors is market-correcting\nrather than market-transforming: it is seen as reducing the incidence of environ-\nmental externalities by rectifying information de\u00aacits and asymmetries. In other\nwords, it is appropriate for states to facilitate information disclosure as a public\ngood to promote market ef\u00aaciencies, but in the service of, rather than as a chal-\nlenge to, pro\u00aat-motivated imperatives for economic growth.11\nIt is necessary to recognize, therefore, the historicity of the informational\ngovernance12 formulated by UNECE for the Aarhus Convention. In the \u00aarst place,\nthe Commission articulated an in\u00bauential variant of what, at the global scale,\nAarti Gupta labels \u201cgovernance by disclosure\u201d\u2014a growing number of regulatory\nforms (mandatory and voluntary) animated by assumptions of due process and\nempowerment through information.13 For the Aarhus Convention, as will be\nshown below, the procedural entitlements favoring public information access\nare legally innovative.

See also Florini 2007.\nmembers of the public is explicitly made in the ninth and tenth preambular\nparagraphs of the Convention, where improved access to information\u2014con-\njoined with public participation\u2014is claimed to enhance public awareness and\nunderstanding, the communication to decision-makers of matters of public\nconcerns, and the greater public accountability of public authorities. Many\nParties to the Convention, in their implementation reports, support the view\nthat information disclosure is enabling for their citizens.14 Within the wider re-\nsearch community, there is also empirical support for this claim, though by no\nmeans a scholarly consensus.15\nSecond, in keeping with market liberal notions of regulatory action, the\nAarhus Convention restricts its direct obligations to public authorities. While\n\u201cpublic authority\u201d is understood in an expansive sense as all governmental au-\nthorities and natural or legal persons with public administrative functions and\nother environmental responsibilities, functions and public service providers\n(Article 2),16 this de\u00aanition clearly circumscribes its class of duty holders. Pri-\nvately owned entities only fall within the immediate scope of the convention in-\nsofar as they perform public functions deemed to be environment-related, such\nas the provision of energy or water services. In terms of public international law,\nthe Convention resonates with those state-based rules which populate the man-\ndatory domain of governance by disclosure, notably treaty obligations on infor-\nmation exchange, noti\u00aacation, consultation and consent.17 Signi\u00aacantly, when\nUNECE considers the role of the private sector in the Implementation Guide to\nthe Aarhus Convention, it is in relation to non-mandatory notions of \u201ccorpo-\nrate citizenship\u201d and stakeholder engagement. Business and industry is men-\ntioned as one of the \u201cmajor groups\u201d already identi\u00aaed by the Rio Declaration\nand Agenda 21 at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Develop-\nment.18 The claim that direct environmental information disclosure for private\noperators can effectively be tackled by voluntary means (e.g. eco-labeling and\neco-auditing schemes) is stated explicitly in Article 5(6) of the Convention,\nwhich relates to the public dissemination of information held by private\nentities.\nInformation Disclosure Provisions in the Aarhus Convention\nThe Access to Information Pillar\nAs already mentioned, Article 1 of the Aarhus Convention establishes access to\nenvironmental information as the \u00aarst of three procedural rights\u2014for all\n14 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n14.

Articles 4\nand 5 cover, respectively, the means by which environmental information can\nbe requested from public authorities and the obligations on Parties to ensure\nthat such authorities actively disseminate environmental information from a\nvariety of sources. Both articles include the provision that obligations are en-\nacted \u201cwithin the framework of national legislation,\u201d which allows Parties\nsigni\u00aacant discretion in disclosing information, including conditions for refus-\ning information requests (e.g. for reasons of national defense and security, com-\nmercial con\u00aadentiality and personal data protection). However, Parties are\nobliged to interpret grounds for refusal in a restrictive way \u201ctaking into account\nthe public interest served by disclosure and taking into account whether the in-\nformation requested relates to emissions into the environment.\u201d19 In contrast to\nthe passive (request-based) disclosure obligations on public authorities con-\ntained in Article 4, Article 5 covers the forms and categories of environmental\ninformation which public authorities are actively required to collect and dis-\nseminate. The priority accorded to public access places the onus on these au-\nthorities to order and publish relevant environmental information, including\nnational state-of-the-environment reports, legislation and policy documents,\nenvironment-related policy information, and information on pollution releases\nand transfers.\nFurthermore, Article 5 provided a legal basis for the Aarhus Parties to de-\nvelop the Protocol on Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTRs)\u2014a com-\nmitment agreed at the First Meeting of the Parties to the Aarhus Convention in\nOctober 2002 at Lucca, Italy. The Protocol was adopted at an Extraordinary\nMeeting of the Parties seven months later in Kiev.20 It is presented by UNECE as\nthe \u00aarst legally binding international instrument on pollution inventories, with\nthe goal of enhancing public access to information through the establishment\nof coherent, integrated, nationwide pollutant release and transfer registers.\nParties are obliged to ensure effective public access to the information con-\ntained in national registers, which follow a harmonized reporting scheme that\nis mandatory, annual, multimedia, facility-speci\u00aac and pollutant or waste-\nspeci\u00aac. The Kiev Protocol is open to all states, so its contribution to informa-\ntional governance transcends the membership of the UNECE.\nThe only other provision of the Aarhus Convention that has generated a\nnew legal instrument requiring the approval of its Parties is an Amendment\nadopted at the Second Meeting of the Parties to the Convention, held in Almaty,\nKazakhstan, 25\u201327 May 2005. The Amendment, which is not yet in force, adds a\nprovision to the Convention (Article 6 bis) requiring each Party to \u201cprovide for\nearly and effective information and public participation prior to making deci-\nsions on whether to permit the deliberate release into the environment and\nplacing on the market of genetically modi\u00aaed organisms.\u201d21 This clause is de-\nMichael Mason \u2022 15\n19.

United Nations Economic and Social Council 2005, Article 6 bis(1).\nsigned to render more precise a reference to genetically modi\u00aaed organisms in\nArticle 6(11) of the Convention, which had deliberately been left vague in its\ndrafting in recognition of the political dif\u00aaculties at that time accompanying the\nnegotiations over what became the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.22 In recog-\nnition of the need to have non-con\u00baicting national biosafety frameworks, the\nAmendment to the Aarhus Convention calls for Aarhus Parties to ratify or ac-\ncede to the Cartagena Protocol. Nevertheless, by complementing the informa-\ntion disclosure provisions of the latter, the Amendment attests to the fact that\nAarhus transparency norms have a wider currency than the Convention.\nInformation Access as a Human Environmental Right\nThe Aarhus Convention is drafted in terms of human rights, declaring in its\nopening article a basic right of every person to a healthy environment. Prior to\nthe Convention, a number of countries had already recognized such a substan-\ntive environmental right in their national constitutions: the Aarhus formulation\nextended this emphatically to international human rights law, as reaf\u00aarmed at\nthe First Meeting of the Parties in Lucca:\nWe recognise the close relationship between human rights and environmen-\ntal protection. Through its goal of contributing to the protection of the right\nof every person of present and future generations to live in an environment\nadequate to his or her health and well-being, the Convention re\u00baects this\nlink.23\nYet the Aarhus Convention is mainly concerned with procedural rights of citi-\nzens, with access to information supportive of access to decision-making and\naccess to justice in environmental matters. It therefore expresses a particular\nblend of human environmental rights, marking procedural entitlements as nec-\nessary for the successful exercise of substantive environmental rights. As the \u00aarst\npillar, access to information may be interpreted as an indispensable prerequisite\nfor the other environmental rights in the Convention.24 Arguably, this implies\nthat the corresponding information disclosure obligations placed on the Con-\nvention Parties and public authorities become critical to the successful function-\ning of the treaty.\nThe three pillars of the Aarhus Convention mirror the procedural entitle-\nments to information, public participation and justice expressed in Principle 10\nof the Rio Declaration.25 There is also a semantic debt to another UNECE\nagreement\u2014the 1991 Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a\nTransboundary Context (Espoo Convention). From this treaty, the Aarhus Con-\nvention imports the broad notion of the public as \u201cone or more natural or legal\n16 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n22.

Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (UN Doc. A\/CONF.151\/26\/REV.1).\npersons\u201d adding, for emphasis, associations, organizations or groups in accor-\ndance with national legislation or practice.26 The Aarhus Convention also has a\nseparate formulation of \u201cthe public concerned,\u201d encompassing those persons\nlikely to be affected by, or having an interest in, the relevant environmental\ndecision-making, including environmental NGOs.27 These expansive notions of\npublic actors are politically signi\u00aacant, because Aarhus entitlements are ad-\ndressed to persons regardless of nationality, residence or citizenship.28 At least\nin principle, then, information disclosure (and other Aarhus) obligations on\npublic authorities are extensive and without discrimination.\nYet, Aarhus environmental rights straddle uneasily between, on the one\nhand, their embodiment as procedural entitlements and, on the other, the so-\ncial welfare aspiration, expressed in Article 1, to provide environmental quality\nadequate to the human health and well-being of all persons. The UNECE as-\nsumption that the former necessarily promotes the latter is asserted rather than\nsubstantiated.29 In the \u00aarst place, the social welfare aim embodied in Article 1 is\nshort-changed insofar as there is no elaboration of its constituent standards or\nregulatory signi\u00aacance. Instead, there is in the rest of the treaty a textual \u201cbrack-\neting\u201d of the Aarhus substantive environmental right, which preserves the lib-\neral political axiom that the state should not encroach unnecessarily on the eth-\nical domain of private life-choices and welfare preferences. Similarly, restricting\nthe subjects of Aarhus duties to public authorities means that private corporate\nentities are shielded from direct obligations under the treaty: this is also consis-\ntent with traditional liberal legal protections afforded to markets against gov-\nernmental interference.\nImplementation and Compliance Experience of Aarhus Provisions on Information\nDisclosure\nThe Aarhus Convention entered into force on 30 October 2001. As of 8 October\n2009, there were 43 Parties to the Convention, 23 Parties to the Kiev Protocol\nand 24 Parties to the Amendment on genetically modi\u00aaed organisms. Decision\nI\/8, adopted at the First Meeting of the Parties, requires Parties to the Conven-\ntion to report on their implementation activities before the relevant Meeting of\nthe Parties. There have now been two reporting cycles: by the Second Meeting of\nthe Parties in May 2005, 24 out of 30 Convention Parties had submitted na-\ntional implementation reports (NIRs), while by the Third Meeting of the Parties\nin Riga, 11\u201313 June 2008, 35 out of 41 Parties had submitted NIRs.30 For each\nreporting cycle, the Aarhus Convention secretariat is charged with producing a\nMichael Mason \u2022 17\n26.

First, the Parties from Eastern Europe, the\nCaucasus and Central Asia (EECCA) are deemed to face common implementa-\ntion issues on the basis of their shared experience as post-Soviet states moving\ninto democratic governance. These Parties are credited by the secretariat with\nhaving made most progress with the access to information pillar in the Conven-\ntion, in part enabled by signi\u00aacant capacity-building for implementation \u00aan-\nanced since 1999 by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe\n(OCSE). OCSE has supported the creation of Aarhus Centers and Public Envi-\nronmental Information Centers\u2014for awareness-raising, training and communi-\ncations activities\u2014in Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyz-\nstan and Tajikistan.31\nIn the second regional grouping\u2014the European Union (EU) countries\nand Norway\u2014implementation of information access provisions are more ad-\nvanced, given prevailing legislation and more mature democratic systems. Fur-\nthermore, European Community rati\u00aacation of the Aarhus Convention means\nthat it is now binding on Community authorities and on Member States, har-\nmonizing the implementation of the Convention across the European Union.\nThus, Regulation (EC) No. 1367\/2006 applying the Aarhus Convention to\nCommunity institutions and bodies was adopted in September 2006. The Euro-\npean Commission subsequently published Directives designed to align Com-\nmunity legislation with each of the three Aarhus pillars, of which Directive\n2003\/4\/EC on public access to environmental information was adopted in Jan-\nuary 2003, repealing a 1990 Directive on environmental information access.32\nThe third regional grouping\u2014South-Eastern Europe (SEE)\u2014covers three\nParties (Albania, Bulgaria and The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)\ndeemed by the Aarhus Convention secretariat to share implementation chal-\nlenges arising from their experience of the regional insecurity of the western Bal-\nkans and their participation in Stabilization and Association Agreements with\nthe European Union. Indeed, the European Commission sponsors a Regional\nEnvironmental Reconstruction Programme for South Eastern Europe, which\nsupports capacity-building for Aarhus Convention implementation.33\nThe two synthesis reports on implementation, prepared to date by the\nAarhus Convention secretariat, indicate that Parties appear to have fewest prob-\nlems in implementing information disclosure obligations compared to the\n18 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n31.

For the provisions on access to information\nupon request (Article 4), all submitted NIRs show relevant legislation in place.\nHowever, with regards to EECCA and SEE Parties, some of the implementation\nobstacles identi\u00aaed by the secretariat in the \u00aarst synthesis report (2005) recur\nthree years later in the second. These include legislative gaps and discrepancies\ncompared to Convention clauses, ambiguities over the meaning of \u201cenviron-\nmental information\u201d and the lack of awareness of citizens\u2019 information rights.\nThere are also marked variations in the legal grounds upon which information\nrequests may be refused. Different legal approaches to implementing Article 4\nare also found in EU countries and Norway, but within a more established cul-\nture of openness: the most signi\u00aacant variation\u2014and one that goes beyond\nAarhus freedom of information provisions\u2014is the right of the public in Norway\nto access information directly from private enterprises, rather than only from\npublic authorities.34 The reported experience of Parties in implementing the\nAarhus obligations on the collection and dissemination of environmental infor-\nmation (Article 5) is similar across the two synthesis reports: appropriate laws\nare in place, but many EECCA and SEE Parties noted procedural uncertainties\nand resource constraints impacting negatively on active information disclosure.\nIn contrast, most EU countries and Norway reported no major obstacles to the\nimplementation of Aarhus provisions on information collection and dissemi-\nnation: indeed, the Convention secretariat applauded progress by these Parties\nin developing electronic tools for information disclosure and in setting up pol-\nlutant release and transfer registers consistent with their rati\u00aacation of the Kiev\nProtocol.35\nNevertheless, recent public communications to the Aarhus Convention\nCompliance Committee reveal a more mixed picture\u2014at least in terms of al-\nleged breaches of information disclosure obligations of the Convention. It is\nwidely recognized that the Aarhus compliance mechanism is legally innovative\ncompared to other multilateral environmental agreements.36 Article 15 of the\nConvention expressly allows for \u201cappropriate public involvement\u201d in a non-\nconfrontational, non-judicial and consultative compliance review mechanism.\nAs agreed at the \u00aarst Meeting of the Parties (Decision I\/7), this has been inter-\npreted to include the right of NGOs to nominate candidates to the Compliance\nCommittee, as well as the right of members of the public (including NGOs) to\nsubmit communications regarding compliance by Parties and to take part in\nCommittee discussions with respect to their submission.37 By the end of 2008,\nthe Compliance Committee had only received one submission from a Party to\nthe Convention with regard to compliance by another Party, but had received\n35 communications on compliance from the public.38 Over half of the public\nMichael Mason \u2022 19\n34.

The constructive recommendations made by\nthe Committee to the three Parties emphasized necessary legislative and regula-\ntory measures for compliance. By the 2008 Meeting of the Parties in Riga, the\nGovernment of Kazakhstan was deemed to be compliant with Article 4 of the\nConvention, but both Ukraine and Armenia were still judged not to be compli-\nant with Convention provisions on access to information.40 Public communica-\ntions to the Compliance Committee in 2008 (Table 1) indicate that charges of\nnon-compliance regarding information disclosure are no longer restricted to\nEECCA countries. For the complaint against the European Commission, the\ncharge by an Albanian NGO was that the European Investment Bank was not re-\nleasing environmental information that it had requested, although the Compli-\nance Committee ruled that the European Community was not in a state of non-\ncompliance, as the information had eventually been provided.41 In the case of\nSpain, the allegation was that a fee imposed by the Party for environmental in-\nformation was unreasonable (in breach of Article 4(8)), while in the Danish\ncase, the communicant charged that the public authorities failed to discharge\nboth passive (Article 4) and active (Article 5) information disclosure responsi-\nbilities concerning the administration of antibiotics in livestock. Both commu-\nnications are under consideration by the Compliance Committee, along with\nallegations of Article 4 non-compliance leveled by NGOs against Poland and\nMoldova.\nThe Incompleteness of Aarhus Information Rights\nIt is arguably still too early in the lifetime of the Aarhus Convention to offer a\nde\u00aanitive assessment of its contribution to the information disclosure policies\nand practices of its contracting Parties. Nevertheless, there is now suf\u00aacient im-\nplementation experience to pinpoint problematic areas in realizing Aarhus\nrights and obligations regarding access to environmental information. I now\nhighlight three such areas: 1) the discretion accorded to Parties in interpreting\nAarhus rights; 2) the exclusion of private entities from mandatory disclosure du-\nties; and 3) the indeterminate coupling of procedural and substantive rights.\nThe Discretion Allowed to Parties in Interpreting Aarhus Rights\nAt several instances in the Aarhus Convention\u2014including the speci\u00aacation of\nobligations for Parties for each of the three pillars\u2014there are references to pre-\nscribed action \u201cwithin the framework of\/in accordance with national legisla-\ntion.\u201d The Convention secretariat has interpreted this to mean that Parties are\nallowed \u201c\u00baexibility\u201d in deciding how to implement selected Aarhus obliga-\nMichael Mason \u2022 21\n40.

Economic Commission for Europe 2009.\ntions.42 This discretionary allowance seems sensible in view of the varying legal\nsystems and governance capacities of the various Parties across the UNECE re-\ngion, but some early commentators on the Convention already anticipated\ndif\u00aaculties arising from the ambiguity of these phrases, including for the access\nto information pillar.43 Implementation experience indicates that the discretion\nallowed to Parties on Aarhus information provisions has been most problem-\natic for EECCA Parties, some of whom have struggled to accommodate freedom\nof information within administrative cultures with an institutional memory of\nsecret and closed decision-making. As Stephen Stec notes, \u201caccess to informa-\ntion, the right to disseminate information, and the control of information are\nstill contentious issues in many countries with a common legacy of strict infor-\nmation control.\u201d44 Of course, part of the administrative challenge facing public\nauthorities in EECCA (and SEE) countries is to respect the political legitimacy of\ncivil society actors as Aarhus rights-holders. For the \u00aave EECCA Parties facing\npublic charges of non-compliance under the Convention, each submission to\nthe Convention Compliance Committee was made by a domestic NGO.\nEven for western European democracies and EU, though, it has been\nclaimed that the interpretive discretion allowed to Parties by the Convention\nhas diluted the force of its obligations. In particular, there are concerns that\nrights to information and participation have sometimes been treated more nar-\nrowly in implementing legislation than the letter or spirit of the Convention.\nFor example, EU Directive 2003\/35\/EC\u2014transposing Aarhus public participa-\ntion provisions to EU Member States\u2014restricts the right to participate in envi-\nronmental decision-making to those affected by or with an interest in the deci-\nsion, rather than to any member of the public (as set out in the Aarhus\nConvention).45 This has implications for information access, as the public par-\nticipation provisions created by the Convention have corresponding informa-\ntion disclosure entitlements. Aarhus-enabled public rights to information and\nparticipation seem to be most at risk of truncation for decision-making with\ntransboundary environmental effects. While the Convention recognizes that\nAarhus rights have effect regardless of nationality (Article 3(9)), this principle of\nnon-discrimination runs against state practice not to grant decision-making\nrights to foreign publics. Zwier argues that the activities of European export\ncredit agencies expose most vividly the implementation gap here, as Aarhus\nConvention rights to access information and decision-making extend in princi-\nple to people abroad affected by the environmental effects of projects \u00aananced\nby such agencies. Yet in practice, these foreign publics typically have no access to\ninformation on export credit agency activities impacting on their lives and live-\n22 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n42.

Self-reporting by Parties on their imple-\nmentation of Article 9(1) reveals a wide range of administrative and\/or judicial\nproceedings and bodies for review of appeals related to requests for informa-\ntion.49 The routing of appeals through divergent legal vehicles justi\u00aaes the\n\u00baexibility of implementation allowed by the Convention, although this makes\nit dif\u00aacult to assess the equality of treatment of applicants between the Parties.\nSo far the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee has not recorded a\nsigni\u00aacant number of grievances over Article 9(1). Public communications have\nalleged non-compliance with Article 9(1) by three Parties\u2014Kazakhstan, Bel-\ngium and Denmark. Of these, Kazakhstan was initially found by the Compli-\nance Committee to be in breach of this access to justice article (by denying ap-\npeal standing to an NGO), but subsequently found to be in compliance\nfollowing the introduction of a new Environmental Code.50 The charge by an\nNGO that Belgium did not provide suf\u00aacient standing for environmental NGOs\nfor appealing information refusals (and other aspects of the Aarhus justice pil-\nlar) was deemed not to be valid as it related to cases before the Convention had\nentered into force in Belgium.51 Finally, the alleged non-compliance of Den-\nmark with Article 9(1) is currently under review by the Compliance Committee.\nThis case is noteworthy as the communicant charges the Danish authorities\nwith having no independent and impartial review body to address the relevant\ninformation disclosure appeal.52\nThe Exclusion of Private Entities from Mandatory Information Disclosure Duties\nAs already noted, Aarhus obligations fall directly on Convention Parties and\nconstituent public authorities, with privately owned entities having Aarhus re-\nMichael Mason \u2022 23\n46.

Convention provisions on information disclosure addressing\nthe environmental impact of private operators (Article 5(6)) and products (Arti-\ncle 5(8)) are framed in a non-mandatory, aspirational fashion. To be sure, the\nobligation on Parties to establish pollutant release and transfer registers (Article\n5(9)), as developed in the Kiev Protocol, is regarded as an important Conven-\ntion mechanism for increasing corporate accountability.53 While the Protocol\nhas now entered into force, there are few signs within Convention practice of a\n\u201chardening\u201d of information disclosure duties on private entities. In its 2008 re-\nview of implementation practice, the Aarhus Convention secretariat noted an\nextensive preference amongst Parties for voluntary eco-labeling and environ-\nmental auditing by the private sector, with mandatory disclosure of product in-\nformation generally limited to speci\u00aac sectors (e.g. European energy ef\u00aaciency\nrequirements for household appliances and vehicles).54 Moreover, at the Third\nMeeting of the Parties in June 2008, in deliberations over the 2009\u20132014 strate-\ngic plan for the Convention, the European Union vetoed a proposal by Norway\nto afford the public the right to access information directly from industry\u2014a\nproposal inspired by community-right-to-know entitlements enshrined in the\nNorwegian constitution and Environmental Information Act 2003.55\nExcluding private enterprises from mandatory information disclosure du-\nties is of course consistent with a market liberal model of corporate social re-\nsponsibility in which any information disclosure depends on the voluntary con-\nsent of the operator.56 According to a recent international survey, the well-\nestablished right to commercial con\u00aadentiality established by this model rou-\ntinely disables access to information on pollutants from industrial facilities.57\nThe right to con\u00aadentiality of commercial information is also a justi\u00aaed legal\nbasis for public authorities to refuse requests for environmental information\nunder the Aarhus Convention (Article 4(4)(d)). This exemption is tempered in\nprinciple by a public interest in information disclosure, but the great variation\nin its legal framing by Parties risks an inequality in implementation practice. At\nleast in one case, there is also evidence that the discretion given to Convention\nParties in assigning private sector responsibilities has signi\u00aacantly eroded an\nAarhus mechanism of corporate accountability. Under the access to justice pillar\nof the Convention, members of the public \u201chave access to administrative or ju-\ndicial procedures to challenge acts and omission by private persons and public\nauthorities which contravene provisions of (. . .) national law relating to the en-\n24 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n.unece.org\/env\/pp\/compliance\/Compliance%20Committee\/28TableDenmark.htm, accessed\n20 April 2010.\n53.

However, in Regulation (EC) No. 1367\/2006 applying the Aarhus\nConvention to Community institutions and bodies, the European Union omits\nthe reference to private parties in its legal codi\u00aacation of this article. For the Eu-\nropean Commission, this omission merely re\u00baects the fact that Community in-\nstitutions or bodies are necessarily public authorities, but as this includes them\nacting in a legislative capacity, the exclusion is questionable.59 It reinforces a\nmarket liberal perspective on regulatory authority in which private operators are\nshielded from administrative and judicial challenges issuing from civil society\nactors.\nThe Indeterminate Coupling of Procedural and Substantive Rights\nThe in\u00bauence of a liberal rights-based paradigm also accounts for the indetermi-\nnate coupling of Aarhus procedural rights with the substantive right referred to\nin Article 1 and the seventh preambular paragraph of the Convention. In the\n\u00aarst place, this re\u00baects a liberal political aversion to prescribe any conception of a\ngood life for individuals who are deemed to exercise freely chosen life-choices.60\nA Declaration made by the UK Government upon signing and ratifying the\nAarhus Convention re\u00baects this, treating the human right to a healthy environ-\nment as no more than an aspiration, and according legal recognition only to the\nrights of access to information, public participation in decision-making and ac-\ncess to justice in environmental matters.61 Even for those Aarhus Parties that rec-\nognize legally this substantive right, there is extensive uncertainty about its con-\nnection with the Convention platform of procedural rights. In the structuring of\ntheir national implementation reports, Parties are requested to follow a tem-\nplate provided by the Convention secretariat: this includes, at Section XXXII, the\nrequest to report on how their implementation of the Aarhus Convention con-\ntributes to the protection of the right to live in an environment adequate to hu-\nman health and well-being. Of the 37 implementation reports received by the\nConvention secretariat in the second (2008) round of reporting, 13 contain no\nresponse to this request and the majority of the rest feature substantive right\nstatements that are cursory and vague. Interestingly, the recurring claim in\nthose reports that construct a more signi\u00aacant response is that Aarhus proce-\ndural rights contribute to ful\u00aalling the substantive right by empowering civil\nMichael Mason \u2022 25\n58.

Advances in information and communications\ntechnologies, which allow citizens to utilize complex information in a politi-\ncally transformative way, may however increase the scope for citizens to explore\nthe conditions needed to realize environmental health and well-being for cur-\nrent and future generations. Article 5(3) of the Aarhus Convention requires\nParties to ensure that environmental information progressively becomes avail-\nable in electronic databases that are publicly accessible, and a majority of Parties\nare now reportedly using electronic communications tools.64 Thus, it is becom-\ning more feasible for these Parties to advance \u201ctargeted transparency\u201d in which\nthe holders of Aarhus rights are able to make reasoned judgments on speci\u00aac\npolicy choices.65 Such moves would complement rather than supplant the gen-\neral information disclosure provisions of the Convention, and are in keeping\nwith its aspirations to environmental democracy.\nConclusion\nAarhus environmental rights have been lauded for increasing citizen access to\nenvironmental information, and thus helping to secure more transparent and\naccountable regulatory processes. The widespread adoption of the Aarhus Con-\nvention is a testament to the successful diffusion of environmental protection\nand democratic governance norms by UNECE. Parties to the Convention have\ngenerally embraced the access to information pillar as a signi\u00aacant political re-\nsource for citizens. I have argued here, however, that the information rights\ngiven force by the Convention are rendered inconsistent in practice by three\nproperties: 1) the discretion accorded to Convention Parties in interpreting\nAarhus rights; 2) the exclusion of private entities from mandatory information\ndisclosure duties; and 3) the indeterminate coupling of procedural and substan-\ntive rights. These constituent properties generate a structural imbalance in the\n26 \u2022 Information Disclosure and Environmental Rights\n62. These \u00aandings are from the author\u2019s survey of 37 national implementation reports submitted\nby end of 2008.\n63. Bell 2004, 103\u2013104; and Jones 2008.\n64.

The preoccupation in the Convention with proce-\ndural entitlements \u00aats comfortably with existing liberal expressions of civil and\npolitical rights in international and the domestic law of most UNECE states,\neven as the bold declaration in the treaty of a universal human right to an envi-\nronment adequate for health and well-being encapsulates a more far-reaching\nconception of social justice. In implementation practice, the tension between\nthese two perspectives is dissipated by the de facto marginalization of the\nAarhus substantive right.\nThe historicity of Aarhus informational governance is central to under-\nstanding the bracketing of its substantive environmental right. This is character-\nized, above all, by a geopolitical context featuring the spread of market liberal-\nism and representative democracy to Eastern Europe, as well as the embrace of\nneo-liberalism by leading Western governments. Indeed, as Paul Langley ob-\nserved at the start of the century, the rise of transparency as an organizing princi-\nple in global environmental governance is closely associated with the partial\nprivatization of that governance, evident in the growth of voluntary forms of in-\nformation disclosure (e.g. environmental auditing and management systems).66\nAs noted above, this ideological current has affected the treatment in the Aarhus\nConvention of private entities, which (in contrast with public authorities) are\nshielded from direct information disclosure duties concerning environmental\ninformation. The other articles in this special issue indicate that a structured\npreference for voluntary disclosure from private actors is typical of new trans-\nparency regimes in global environmental governance.67 While the motives for\nthe move to transparency vary across different sectors and regions68\u2014in the case\nof the Aarhus Convention, the rationale was democratic capacity-building for\nenvironmental governance\u2014the routine disclosure of environmental informa-\ntion by private corporations is rarely prescribed. Yet in the Aarhus Convention,\nthis sits uneasily with the substantive right to an environment adequate for hu-\nman health and well-being, as Aarhus information disclosure (and other) rights\nare thereby cut off from the private constellations of power they must breach to\nbe effective.\nAt the same time, even the mandatory disclosure duties on state-centered\nactors in the Aarhus Convention are tempered by the discretion accorded to\nParties in implementing Aarhus obligations. Here the constraining normative\ncontext is a global governance realm in which there is no overarching political\nauthority, such that multilateral cooperation must operate on the basis of the\nconsent of states (and state-centered organizations) to rules that constrain their\nsovereign authority. The architects of the Aarhus Convention judged the discre-\ntionary space allowed to Parties in interpreting Aarhus obligations to be neces-\nMichael Mason \u2022 27\n66. Langley 2001.\n67.

In practice, as noted above, this seems to have diluted the\nforce of Aarhus information (and participation) rights, particularly for decision-\nmaking with transboundary environmental effects, as foreign publics suffer\nfrom a lack of speci\u00aacation of their Aarhus entitlements. Once again, the\nemancipatory intent of the Aarhus substantive right suffers, also because the dis-\ncretion afforded to Convention Parties includes the scope to interpret how to\nsquare Aarhus procedural obligations with the realization of substantive envi-\nronmental justice. Given the potentially far-reaching rami\u00aacations of the\nAarhus human right to ecologically adequate conditions of life, it is not surpris-\ning that few Parties have made more than a symbolic commitment to meeting\nit.\nReferences\nAarhus Convention. 1999.
