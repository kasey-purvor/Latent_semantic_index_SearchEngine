These traditions\nhave many strengths. For example, there have been investigations of the connec-\ntions between household composition, housing migration, and housing submarkets\n(Leishman and Watkins, 2004; Meen and Meen, 2003; Siebrits, 2005); spatial differ-\nences in house-price inflation (Ashworth and Packer, 1997; Johnes and Hyclak, 1999);\nhow the market for property is animated by changes in legislation and in interest rates\n(Anderson, 2005; Foster, 2004); and by the balance of credit constraints, income\nshocks and risk aversion (Diaz-Serrano, 2005; Ortalo-Magne and Rady, 2006). What\nis striking, however, in housing economics (as in other styles of economics) is that\n(housing) markets themselves are rarely open to scrutiny. New institutional approaches\nadd an element of agency (Guy and Henneberry, 2000; Kauko, 2004), but for the most\npart, even in work in a behavioural framework, the market tends to be taken for\ngranted as an essential economic mechanism which exists apart from any actions and\nintentions of consumers and investors. This perpetuates an assumption, common in\nneoliberalism, that the market is the backdrop against which actions are taken, rather\nthan something which is itself embodied and performed.\nRecently, there has been growing interest among researchers within sociology,\nanthropology, geography, and science and technology studies in the traditional domain\nof economists\u00f6the economy. Of the many areas of economy scrutinised in this way,\n`the market' is perhaps one of the last black boxes to be opened up for consideration.\nNevertheless, there is an emergent interest in the complex, socially inflected and\nThe emotional economy of housing\nHazel Christie\nInstitute of Geography, University of Edinburgh, Drummond Street, Edinburgh EH8 9XP,\nScotland; e-mail: hazel.christie@ed.ac.uk\nSusan J Smith\nDepartment of Geography, University of Durham, Science Laboratories, South Road, Durham\nDH1 3LE, England; e-mail: susanj.smith@durham.ac.uk\nMoira Munro\nDepartment of Urban Studies, University of Glasgow, 25 Bute Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RS,\nScotland; e-mail: moira.munro@socsci.gla.ac.uk\nReceived 15 November 2006; in revised form 6 March 2007; published online 4 August 2008\nEnvironment and Planning A 2008, volume 40, pages 2296^2312\nAbstract. This paper offers an interpretation of the role of emotions in animating housing markets\nwhich complements more traditional economic and behavioural studies of locally based house-price\ninflation. Looking to debates within social psychology and cultural studies we suggest that emotions\npermeate the materiality and meaning of housing markets as well as the experience of individuals\nacting within them. Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in Edinburgh, with households who\nbought in a rising market, we argue that housing transactions are emotional as well as economic\naffairs. We reconsider the fears that underpin what might appear to be `irrational exuberance' and we\nargue that housing markets are propelled by a search for returns on emotional as well as financial\ninvestments.\ndoi:10.1068\/a39358power-filled nature of the marketplace. The consensus here is that markets are made,\nnot given. If actions, beliefs, and behaviours appear classically economic, the questions\nto be asked are: how has the rich texture of social life been pared down in this way;\nhow is the economic constituted as such (Callon, 1998; Hay, 2004); and how are\nmarkets performed (Mackenzie, 2004; Mackenzie and Millo, 2003; Smith et al, 2006).\nFrom this perspective, markets are fragile and contested terrains, not detached and\nautonomous structures. Old certainties about price and value, scarcity and competition\nare being challenged, and social scientists are beginning to expose the multiplicity of\nmarkets, exploring their local variations, their emotional qualities, and their embodied\nmateriality.\nThis shift connects with broader concern across the social sciences to rescue\nemotions from their assumed position beyond rational knowledge (Barbalet, 2002;\nBondi, 2005). Within science, emotions have long been understood as an `interference'\nwith the capacity for logical thinking, and the triumph of reason depends on their\ncontrol and on the advance of detachment and objectivity. But in developing a non-\nessentialist approach to emotions, commentators such as Barbalet (2001), and Williams\n(2000) reject binaries between rationality and emotion or reason and emotion and\nregard thoughts and feelings as continuous. Indeed, Hochschild (1979) argues that\nqualities of detachment, objectivity, scepticism, and so on are simply specific forms\nof `emotion work' which have been privileged within accounts of scientific method. In\nthis non-essentialist view of emotions, multiple logics exist, each of which encompasses\nthoughts and feelings, with no binary of rational and irrational and no separation\nbetween reason and emotion. Recasting emotions as critical elements of social inter-\naction and decision making opens up for scrutiny the contingent conditions under\nwhich a desired outcome\u00f6buying a house\u00f6may be possible. Here, behaviour and\ndecision making are conceptualised as the result of thoughts and feelings which may\nbe conscious and\/or unconscious and which reflect the amalgam of emotions associated\nwith experiences in different times and spaces (Ettlinger, 2004).\nAll the indications are that passions and emotions shape the contours of all\nindividual and collective bodies: emotions permeate the social and physical environ-\nment of markets as well as the subjective experience of individuals acting within them\n(Davidson et al, 2005; Lupton, 1998; Thrift, 2004). This is already recognised in a\ngrowing literature around cultural economy, in which it is increasingly de rigeur to\nclaim that markets are as passionate as they are rational.Where the passions of markets\nare explored in this literature, however, the emphasis has tended to be on the strategic,\nand cynical, manipulation of `feeling rules' for commercial ends. This is the case, for\nexample, for the articles gathered together by Amin and Thrift (2004) under the label\n``The economy of passions''. With this as the yardstick, it seems difficult to move away\nfrom the passion to accumulate, even within a framework explicitly concerned with\nother emotional energies (though for a fuller account, see Ettlinger, 2004)\nOur wider starting point, however, is that markets are saturated with all kinds of\nemotions, sometimes calm and predictable, sometimes wild and out of control, some-\ntimes dependent on aggressive behaviour, but also infused with humour, warmth,\naffection, even love. Some emotions are already integral to how markets are imagined\nand portrayed, with profound implications for the experiences of the individuals who\nact within them. Others remain to be excavated; they may even be a resource for\nreshaping the conduct and ethic of market relations (Smith, 2005). Either way, a study\nof markets needs to attend to a broad `sociality of emotions': to how a wide range of\nfeelings circulate and generate effects (see Ahmed, 2004). This is a radical departure\nfrom accounts which deny the emotional character of some kinds of transaction, or\nwhich emphasise the interiority of emotions (that is, which see them as residing solely\nThe emotional economy of housing 2297within objects or individuals). Recognising that the economy is driven by emotional\nenergy as well as calculative imperatives is part of a project which aims to deessen-\ntialise markets: to engage in the empirical detail which describes their particularity,\nvalorises their diversity, and draws from their `texture' to emphasise their distinctions\nrather than to presume their similarity.\nThat said, however, there are some pointers to the emotional economy of housing\nin the established literatures on financial markets and economics. In particular, two\nsets of debates have attended to the affective dimensions of (housing) market processes:\nfirst, deliberations on the nature of house-price bubbles highlight the role of certain\nemotions (most notably of confidence, optimism, and greed) in driving up the prices\npaid for properties; and second, work positioning the home as an emotional space\nincludes accounts not only of home as an expression of identity, but also as a pivotal\ntheme in the struggle for financial security. By considering each of these debates in\nturn we set the scene for our own empirical investigation of the diverse ways in which\naffective energy permeates the working of one local housing market.\nEmotions and house-price bubbles\nAlthough economic theory is rarely concerned directly with emotional issues, the\nvolatility in housing, as well as in financial, markets is conceptualised affectively\nwhen it is described in the language of `speculative bubbles'. Stiglitz (1990, page 13)\npoints to the importance of emotions, particularly optimism about future prices, in\ncreating price bubbles:\n``If the reason that the price is high today is only that the selling price will be high\ntomorrow\u00f6when fundamental factors do not seem to justify such a price\u00f6then a\nbubble exists.''\nWhile this explanation begins from an economic account of price (the fundamental\nfactors), it provides some insight into the role of perceptions and confidence in guiding\nthe decisions which households make about paying for stocks and shares and, by\ninference, for property.\nThe relevance of discourses of confidence in specific housing markets was consid-\nered by Case and Shiller (1988, page 223) who used survey work in the US to argue\nthat localised housing booms occur because ``people seem to form their expectations\non the basis of past price rather than on any knowledge of fundamentals.'' Bubbles,\nthey suggest, are the result of the interplay between `fundamental factors', `factors\nproviding a dynamic adjustment', and `equilibrium price'. The discrepancy between\nthe price suggested by economic theory and that achieved in practice is accounted\nfor by the affective energy of the market. This energy encompasses exaggerated expec-\ntations, excitement, and the passing of word-of-mouth information about price. Useful\nhere are inferences made from studies of stock-market behaviour\u00f6inferences quite\nexplicitly drawn out by Shiller (2005)\u00f6where bubbles are explained by reference to\nthe `irrational exuberance' of investors: that is, the pervasive and optimistic human\nbelief that market prices have risen in the past, will continue to rise in the future, and\nwill thus provide a risk-free investment in the long run. Hearing about, believing,\nand acting upon the expectation that prices will continue to rise thus fuels locally\nbased appreciation, and this `herd behaviour' is offered as an explanation of why\n``speculative bubbles appear to be a local phenomenon, occurring in one city but not\nin another relatively nearby city'' (Shiller, 1990, page 60). Similarly, in work on US\nhousing cycles, Glaeser et al (2005) conclude that in coastal towns, where appreciation\nhas been greatest, some psychological component must have been at play, such that\n`irrational exuberance' magnifies the effect, for instance, of scarcity of properties\n(an economic fundamental).\n2298 H Christie, S J Smith, M MunroThere is agreement amongst housing economists, then, that an emotional energy\nunderpins `irrational exuberance', but its form and animation are rarely opened to\nscrutiny. Indeed, it is something that economists have rarely found easy to account\nfor, leaving their conclusions sounding less than conclusive:\n``The effect on house prices of intra-urban location appears to be dominated by the\nidiosyncratic influences of individual homes and their immediate environments''\n(Archer et al, 1996, page 334).\n``Many mysteries remain'' (Abraham and Hendershott, 1994, page 17).\nBut rereading these statements in the light of the literature on emotions outlined\nabove suggests that this inconclusiveness might stem from the limited conceptualisa-\ntion of emotions in studies of house-price bubbles\u00f6as a restricted set of positive\n(exuberance, optimism) interiorised emotions. It is possible that other emotions\u00f6\nfear, desire, love, desperation\u00f6feature in driving up prices, or that anxiety or distress\nmight play a part in housing transactions, especially in the light of the multilayered\nnature of different kinds of emotions anchored in and around the home. In this read-\ning, decisions about what price to pay for property may be motivated as much by the\nemotional values which households can extract from properties as by the potential for\neconomic investment. Debates on bubbles, which position housing as an economic\ninvestment, may be inconclusive precisely because of the limited attention paid to the\nemotional economy of markets.\nEmotions and the meaning of home\nHousing studies also has a reasonably long tradition of interest in households' emo-\ntional investments in their home\u00f6that is, in the property they purchase and\/or live in\n(see Blunt and Dowling, 2006). The attainment of owner-occupation, for example, has\noften been associated with ontological security, and much has been made of the strong\nemotional connections between home ownership and feelings of privacy and security\n(Saunders, 1990). Studies have investigated the home as an expression both of moral\nrespectability and of individual identity (Leslie and Reimer, 2003; Tolia-Kelly, 2004).\nIn particular, the literature on the meaning of home makes reference to the emotional\npower of aspirations, identities, and ideologies in the decisions which households make\nabout where and how to live, whether in terms of the paradoxical meanings of home\nfor lesbian households (Valentine, 1993) or of the connections between home, taste, and\ndesire in studies of gentrification (Bridge, 2006; Caulfield, 1989). Other work contains\nimportant\u00f6if tangential\u00f6insights about the role of passion, insecurity, anxiety, and\nstress in underpinning people's relationships to housing and home (see, for example,\nRobinson et al, 2004; Warrington, 2001).\nWhat tends to be less well aired in this literature is the interweaving of emotion and\neconomy: the meaning of the home and the conduct of the market are often concep-\ntually distinct, reflecting the tendency within the social sciences to equate emotions\nwith individual experience (the psychology of buying property) at the expense of\nunderstanding the fundamentally relational qualities of the more rounded `emotional-\nisation' of economic life (including the marketplace) (Williams, 2000). One exception\nhere is research tapping into the psychosocial stress associated with marginal home-\nownership. This work draws attention to the emotional costs of mortgage default,\nthe risk of repossession and a range of other financial concerns associated with the\nsustainability of owner-occupation (Christie, 2000; Nettleton and Burrows, 2001; Smith\net al, 2004) Apart from this work, which tends to be associated with exit from, rather\nthan entry into, the market for homes, there is very little elaboration on how and\nwhy the economics of housing or home are underpinned by a range of emotional\naffairs. There is limited commentary on the complex relationship between emotions\nThe emotional economy of housing 2299and price, and on the way in which housing markets are emotional landscapes which\nare implicated in creating and sustaining house-price volatility.\nThe anatomy of a housing boom\nTo work towards a more textured account of the emotional economy of housing we\ndraw from a qualitative study of a local housing market in Britain conducted at a time\nwhen house prices were rising steeply. Although the study was not specifically designed\nto capture the emotional dynamics of housing-market behaviour, an interesting char-\nacteristic of the sample of households was that they all described the emotional\nimpulse to their eventual house purchase. This introduced a new and exciting dimen-\nsion to the study: namely, an investigation of the links between emotions and economic\nbehaviour. The work is set in Edinburgh, Scotland, and involved in-depth qualitative\ninterviews with households who had bought property in one of four urban neighbour-\nhoods. The choice of Edinburgh for the purposes of this paper is notable because\nprices in the city were rising dramatically and ahead of prices elsewhere in the UK,\nwith the exception of Greater London. Between 1996 and 1999 residential property\nprices increased by at least a third in more than half of the city's postcode sectors. It is\nprecisely at a time of rapid house-price inflation that the economic meaning of price\nmight most evidently be infused with other kinds of affects. Exuberance at the prospect\nof getting onto the housing ladder, fears about being priced out of the market, anxieties\nabout location, or desperation to move, may be more evident (and more open to\nscrutiny by researchers) when prices are volatile than during periods of market stability.\nThis is not to suggest that a quiet market is devoid of emotional energy\u00f6far from it\u00f6\nbut to argue that at times of rapid price increase individuals and households may be\nmore likely to convey their emotional states through descriptions of their experiences.\nThe case study is thus well placed to elucidate the emotional turbulence that characterises\na rising market.\nThe particular ways in which property is conveyed also construct the emotional\nterrain of marketplaces, and in order to contextualise the more detailed evidence which\nfollows, it is useful to describe the process of house purchase in Scotland. The common\nprice mechanism is a closed auction, inviting sealed bids by a set date. Homes are\ntypically offered at a price inviting `offers over' (called the `upset price' in Edinburgh).\nPotential buyers have to work out what the property is worth (usually securing a survey\nor valuation). They can find out, through their solicitors, how many people have\nexpressed interest in the property, and how many have had the dwelling surveyed.\nThis gives them an indication of the likely competition. Buyers (together with their\nlegal advisor) decide what price to bid. Sellers (together with their legal advisor) decide\nwhich offer to accept, usually as soon as the closing date is past. The decisions taken\nat that point (the offer made, the bid accepted) are experienced as legally binding\n(although in fact this perception reflects the power the intermediaries have to enforce\nthe contract).\nThis system of house purchase may appear to be a risky process for the buyer. It is\ncostly to lose by a small margin or to win by a large one. But in steady market\nconditions the `rules of the game' are widely understood (SCC, 2000). As we shall\nsee, bidding for a property is always an intrinsically emotional process, bringing with\nit worries and anxieties about pricing the bid and losing the property, as well as the\nthrill and exhilaration of making a successful purchase. So when prices rise rapidly and\ntraditional market signals break down, discourses about the market become more evi-\ndently infused with emotions. This allows us to engage with questions of how markets,\nvariously conceived, are encountered as sources of excitement, distress, pleasure, and\n2300 H Christie, S J Smith, M Munrodespair, both producing winners and fostering a sense of well-being and producing\nlosers and creating a sense of exclusion.\nParticipation in the project was invited from households who had bought into the\nareas of the city where prices of properties were rapidly appreciating. A database of all\nhouse prices and transactions for the City of Edinburgh from 1996 to 1999 was\nacquired from the Land Value Information Unit at the University of Paisley. This set\nthe context for the choice of four areas which were at the leading edge of the boom in a\nrange of price brackets and across a range of types of neighbourhood. These included\ntwo high-price locations: area G was characterised by town housing and access to\ngood state schools; in N, Georgian flats predominated in an area of high cultural status.\nA medium-price neighbourhood, M, had a mix of purpose-built Victorian flats and\nconversions. Finally L\u00f6with low prices\u00f6was a rapidly appreciating neighbourhood\ndominated by tenement flats.\nA further database of prices and other information (including the previous address\nof the buyer) for each individual transaction in the study period (January 1998 to\nSeptember 1999) was compiled from the Registrar of Sasines for the four case-study\nareas. This information was used to construct a sample, stratified by date of purchase\nand house price, of house purchasers for potential interview. In total 174 households\nfrom the four areas were contacted by letter and asked to participate in an interview.\nA relatively good response rate was achieved for an opt-in survey and 66 households\n(38% response rate) took part in the study; this paper is based on their narratives. The\ninterviews were semistructured and designed to pay special attention to households'\nproperty searches, to experiences of price and pricing, and to perceptions of the rising\nmarket. The recordings were transcribed and coded for computer-assisted retrieval. The\nargument presented here is based on a systematic and rigorous analysis of transcripts\nwhich involved: drawing out the major themes of the interviews; examining how far\ncommon themes\/values were shared across respondents; identifying the themes and\ncharacteristics associated with expressed views; and highlighting any relatively uncom-\nmon themes. Close reading was used to place each expressed theme within the context\nof the wider household's circumstances.\nThroughout the paper the detail of the households' experiences is used to illustrate\nthe emotional dynamics of the housing market, including the complex interplay\nbetween the emotional experiences of individual households and abstract emotional\ndiscourses about the rapidly changing market. Although studies of emotions often\ndraw upon data garnered from a series of research methods (Anderson, 2006) the\nrich texture of the information gathered in skilfully executed interviews provided a\nwindow through which to study the relations between emotions and (economic) decision\nmaking (for a similar approach see Milligan, 2005). In what follows, these experiences\nprovide a more nuanced account than is currently available of the emotionally charged\nterrain that constitutes the `housing market'. The analysis of interview material also\nallows us to conceptualise housing transactions as an emotionally charged arena in\nwhich feelings of anxiety and desperation, or of exhilaration and excitement, infuse\nrational economic judgments about price.\nIn this paper we suggest that the emotional and the economic are intimately linked\nin the way in which housing markets work, in at least three ways. These form the three\nsections of the discussion.\nFirst, we show how housing markets are infused with emotional qualities and\nexperienced as emotional subjects every bit as much as (and perhaps more than)\neconomic objects by buyers of homes. In this example the dominant emotional subject\nis a landscape of fear. In the second section we focus on the price effects of these\naffective qualities of the market; we draw attention to the economics of emotion.\nThe emotional economy of housing 2301We show in particular how modes of engagement with appreciating housing markets\nmay be mediated by fear and desperation (rather than by greedy speculation) in ways\nthat drive up prices.We go on in section 3 to show that the flip side of these fears is the\nhope inspired by the objects of attachment within markets: by the homes and neigh-\nbourhoods that people are trying to buy. People pay high prices for property because\nthey are attracted to particular houses or neighbourhoods\u00f6objects they fall in love\nwith and build emotional relationships around. Housing attainment is as much about\nemotional returns as it is about financial investment; as much about affective ties\n(binding people and `things') as about speculating on the prospects for wealth\naccumulation (on the options for tying the financial present to the economic future).\nThe emotional character of the market\nFinancial, rather than housing, markets have been most closely scrutinised from a\nsocial perspective in recent years. This work has revealed the extent to which emotions\non the trading floor are played out around a competitive imperative: interactions are\nabout high performance, about (macho and sometimes sexually charged) aggression\nand violence, about playing to win (Hassoun, 2004). Where the affective qualities in\nhousing markets appear in the literature they are (at least tacitly) presented as being\ndrawn from rational and calculative imperatives and directed towards investment gains\nand speculation. Our discourse implies direct parallels between financial and housing\nmarkets, suggesting that they too are aggressive and competitive, concerned with the\nexcitement of speculation, investment, and growth, and, above all, based on the actions\nof self-interested economic individuals who are playing to win. As Smith (2005) demon-\nstrates, this particular economic scripting of the market is consistent with a wider\nneoliberal discourse about how markets ought to work: an emphasis on competitive\nindividualism and economic efficiency sets up markets as places where particular kinds\nof emotions help buyers to succeed. Not surprisingly, these are the emotions which\nare endowed with institutional and political authority, and which contribute to the\nways in which housing-market activity driven by professional intermediaries becomes\n(increasingly) economic in orientation.\nAmong buyers' experiences of the Edinburgh housing market, however, there were\nremarkably few references to a market with this aggressive `business model' character.\nN8(1) referred to a market which ``was gonna be a bit punchy'', even though this buyer\nwas not particularly ``playing to win'', and claimed not to have bought as an invest-\nment. G8 also talked about the disappointment of putting in an `exciting' offer only\nto be ``well beaten''. Initial reactions to these volatile conditions were tinged with fear\nand many buyers considered withdrawing from the market, reporting that crowded\nviewings and numerous expressions of interest were off-putting rather than enticing\nor exciting:\n``All the properties with `offers over', they were just completely swamped [with viewers].\nSo we actually didn't ever put an offer on any properties because we were just\ncompletely scared off by the amount of people on the Thursday and Sunday viewings\n.... I was actually petrified of getting into this bidding war and just haemorrhaging\nmoney on surveys'' (G3).\n``I got put off, I definitely got put off. If there were too many notes of interest or too\nmany surveys I wouldn't take it any further'' (L10).\nThis reveals a dominant and explicit fear of the competition in the market that\nincreased as the perceived ferocity of that competition increased.\n(1) Respondents are identified by a letter (giving the area they bought in) and a number (giving the\norder in which interviews were undertaken). Any identifying details have been removed.\n2302 H Christie, S J Smith, M MunroThe limited references to any excitement involved in engaging in the market, about\nplaying to win or enjoying the thrill of the contest, were notable precisely because of\nthe degree of competition most buyers had encountered: all purchases had been made\nin rapidly appreciating neighbourhoods and buyers had typically won a bidding war.\nComments about any excitement of the market were instead restricted to pleasure in\nthe outcomes\u00f6the successful purchase or the (profitable) sale of a previous property.\nG10's successful bid ``felt great actually'' while L11's experience of selling a flat and\nwaiting for bids was that you ``found yourself becoming quite greedy ... wondering\nmaybe if you could get even more for it.''Another (G2) ``had a wee shottie at ... playing\naround'' when they sold their flat on a high fixed price.(2)\nThe dominant characterisation of the market by buyers was its uncertain, danger-\nous, quite frightening, qualities. Buyers at first expected the market to be a relatively\nstable, knowable and manageable entity. But in practice they encountered something\nthey characterised as ``out of control'', ``crazy'' or ``wild''. ``It's mad, completely mad''\nsaid one buyer (G3), commenting on a property which sold for more than twice its\nupset price. And ``the market has just gone wild'', said another (G6) to account for\nhaving ``no idea what to offer'' on a property. The same buyer used terms like ``spiral-\nling out of control'' to explain why, as far as house prices were concerned, Edinburgh\nhad become ``nightmare city''.\nAs Ahmed (2004) points out, emotions are relational, so drawing on discourses\nof the market as `mad' is to construct its recent history as `sane' and consistent. By\nimplication, the `old' market was understood, while this `new' market was experienced\nas uncertain and unknowable.``Incredibly uncertain and incredibly unguided'' was how\none buyer (G6) described the process of deciding how much to offer on a house.``I did\na lot of research but no one really had answers'' was L5's experience of the market;\nwhile L10 found that you ``don't really know what you're gonna pay, you could pay \u00bb1k\nover or you could pay \u00bb10k over, just depending on how the market is at the time.\nIt's not consistent by any means.''\nThis uncertainty was experienced as frightening.What is interesting here is how, by\nexperiencing the encounter with the market as scary or stressful, the respondents\napprehended the market as the cause of the feeling. As the buyer becomes fearful,\nworried, and anxious, the market becomes increasingly characterised as fearsome,\nsomething to be afraid of. L17 missed being the highest bidder by only ``a few hundred\npounds'' and described how this made her feel ``really despondent'' and subsequently\n`absolutely distraught' about looking again in a market which was ``obviously a night-\nmare''. Indeed, some went so far as to characterise the market as dangerous\u00f6not just\nfor its financial risks, but for other reasons. G13 felt that the market was ``quite\ndangerous in that we might end up then buying something that we didn't really\nwant.'' There is a suggestion here of a fear that the encounter with an irrational market\nmight even prove contagious\u00f6that the buyer risks becoming infected with its madness.\nUnderstanding how markets become infused with feelings of uncertainty and fear\nraises questions about what these emotions do, both in terms of how individual buyers\norientate themselves towards and away from them, and of how these discourses are\nperformed through their subsequent actions. For the buyers their construction of\nthe market as uncertain and inconsistent radically disrupted their sense of being in\ncontrol: they felt unable either to read or to understand the market, at least in the first\ninstance. What became clear to them was that to succeed they had to build a new and\ndifferent kind of relationship with this fearsome market, which involved repositioning\n(2) Sellers can choose to offer their property on a `fixed', or set, price. The first person to offer this\namount secures the sale.\nThe emotional economy of housing 2303themselves as knowledgeable actors working within a new set of market discourses. They\nhad to take stock of it and (re)learn how it was operating. This learning process too\nwas an intensely emotional experience as buyers went through the `stress', `shock' and\n`devastation' of discovering\u00f6and adjusting to\u00f6Edinburgh's rising house prices. These\nprocesses were most pronounced amongst buyers who were new to the (Scottish)\nmarket. The first-timer buyers like L2 ``felt very na|\u00abve being a first-time buyer''.\nAnother, L4, was typical in recounting that ``we didn't realise quite how bad it was\nuntil we started actively looking for things''; they recalled their ``first shock''on bidding\nfor a flat which sold for an ``astronomical'' price. And buyers who were new to the\nScottish system of sealed bids also wrestled with the market practices and conditions.\nN2, who were moving to Scotland, ``agonised'' over a first bid, were ``devastated'' when\nthey lost the house by a large margin, and were forced to the realisation that they\n``were completely na|\u00abve about the Edinburgh property market.''\nBut emotions are also multilayered, and enjoyment and fear can coexist, as G2\nsuggests in his comments about the potential pleasure of learning how to succeed in the\nnew marketplace. He argued that learning the new rules involved ``getting a feel for\nthe market''; you have to ``engross yourself in it'' for a few months before you could\nknow how to proceed. So there was recognition of the importance of being attached to\nthe market, to being a part of it, and an idea that this involved learning new ``feeling\nrules'' (Hochschild, 1983). G14 expressed this immersion in the market in blunt terms,\ncommenting that ``I think you learn bitterly from experience but that's the way to\nlearn.'' N10 knew that they could finally achieve a successful bid because ``we [had]\ngot ourselves familiarised with it by then.''\nThe qualities of this market seem quite different from those suggested in the tone of\npolitical debate and economic theory. Certainly, households viewed the market as\ncompetitive and as a structure of power, but they felt they could not engage with it,\nor control it, in any meaningful economic sense. Economic `fundamentals'could not be\nused in any reliable way to decide on a winning price, and securing a property was\nmore often characterised as `lucky' than logical. If prices are not driven rationally in\nresponse to the economic environment, what does propel the kind of price appreciation\nthat set off the Edinburgh housing boom? In the next section we show that fear has its\nown price effects; in the final section we show that these gain purchase through the\npower of a complementary set of emotions, through the hopes invested in people's love\nfor a home.\nAffective effects\nRespondents were selected because they had succeeded in buying property at the\ncutting edges of Edinburgh's inflationary market. The average price paid across all\nfour areas was \u00bb176000 (much more than the national average at the time). For many\nthe process had been fraught with difficulty. Over half of the interviewees (35=66)h a d\nmade one or more unsuccessful offers, and 11 were unsuccessful on three or more\noccasions. Most ended up paying more than they had anticipated for the properties\nthey finally bought. And they often paid more than seemed `rational': 44=66 paid more\nthan 10% over the asking price, and a third (21=66) paid more than 10% over the\nsurveyor's valuation of their property. Not surprisingly, compromises made over price,\nspace, and location were differentiated across the housing market. In the low-price area\nsome purchasers felt they had been forced out of more attractive areas of the city or\nhad compromised on the number of bedrooms; while in the higher priced areas the\nmajority response was to pay more\u00f6up to as much as \u00bb100000 more\u00f6for the desired\nproperty in the desired location. But it is to the emotional aspects of these compro-\nmises that we turn, and to the ways in which particular emotions\u00f6most notably fear,\n2304 H Christie, S J Smith, M Munroanxiety and desperation\u00f6have material price effects. Constructing the market as a\nfearful place evokes the feelings of loss of control described above and creates anxieties\nabout exclusion from the desired end. These emotional discourses create conditions\nunder which buyers behave in particular ways, giving an impetus to bidding high, so\ntheir search for a property can be brought to an end.\nAlthough, as argued above, the initial response to a crowded market was fear of the\ncompetition, and the exercising of caution and control, fear could ultimately lead\nbuyers in the opposite direction. As G12 explained:\n``although it should have made us maybe be more cautious it suddenly made us\npanic ... that was something that should have put us off but actually made us more\ninclined to look really, I think. So it was quite a sort of bizarre experience.''\nClearly, emotions play an important role in house purchase in a rising market. The\nkey point here is that these emotions are shaped through contact with the market, and\nare not simply `in' the buyer or `in' the market. Emotions are social and cultural\npractices, and this is evident in the respondents' accounts of their fearful relationship\nwith the market. Across the sample as a whole they drew attention to two aspects of\nthis relationship: first an overriding desperation to move; and secondly anxiety about\nsecuring (or not) the property of their choice. The impact of these two factors is\nconsidered in turn.\nFirst, there was a strong sense of the desperation which underpinned the behaviour\nof individual households who wanted to move for family reasons or who were having\nproblems with their existing property or neighbourhood. Classic accounts of housing\nchoices in relatively difficult market conditions stress that decisions about moving\nbecome formulated as `needs', typically triggered by life-cycle factors such as job\nchanges, moving cities, or new or growing families (Munro and Madigan, 1998,\npage 732). But the respondents in this study show how these `classic' factors come\ninto play precisely because of their emotional dimensions. It is the desperation to\naccommodate new needs\u00f6the anxiety about not having a home (a place to live in a\nnew city, or a room for a new baby) rather than exclusion from financial returns\u00f6\nwhich underpins and becomes entangled with more rational trade-off processes. For\nsome the pressures were tied up with changes in household size and composition:\n``it was a flat we were in ... before, and we had enough bedrooms but it was on a\nfairly busy street and it was just really difficult with one child and I thought `two'?\n... the pressure increased when I got pregnant and also further into the pregnancy\nthe more it was like ... crunch time [laughter]\u00f6an ultimatum\u00f6`I am not looking\nafter two children in this flat''' (G4).\nFor others the desperation was structural in nature\u00f6they wanted to move across\ntenures or they were relocating to Edinburgh as part of a broader life change. M7 was\n``desperate to move out of the rented house'' and M12 were relocating from the\nMidlands:\n``we were in rented accommodation at the time, all our belongings were in storage\nand we were getting married in the August ... so there was some pressure on time\n... and I think that ... was part of the ... desperation.''\nSecondly, anxiety to secure a property, and to exit from this `crazy' market, was a\ncommon theme. Respondents expressed their nervousness about finding a property to\nmove to, and their fear of being excluded from some sectors of the market as prices\ncontinued to rise. This was particularly evident amongst the first-time buyers in the\nlow-priced neighbourhood whose economic decisions were infused by an emotional\nenergy about losing a place on the housing ladder. L16 was typical in wanting to``hurry\nup and find somewhere otherwise the kind of place that I would like would move\nquickly out of what I could afford.'' But this nervousness about securing (or not) a\nThe emotional economy of housing 2305property held across the sample because people wanted a particular neighbourhood\nor a certain size of house and could see it rapidly becoming less affordable to them.\nLike N10, most people were conscious that\n``components of the market were rising as you were looking so that led to quite a bit\nof anxiety [about exclusion] as well because you were aware that prices were going\nup ... even while you were trying to find somewhere to buy.''\nThere is a sense of a ticking time bomb, where the inevitable real-time delays before a\ntransaction can be secured compound anxiety in ways which are, again, quite distinct\nfrom conditions in the near-instant exchanges of the financial market speculators.\nThis characterisation of the market as a place of fear, as a place of potential loss\nand exclusion, created the conditions in which households paid high prices for prop-\nerty. In this study, fear had a material effect on price. Buyers recounted their decision\nto pay ``higher prices'', to `up the offer'', even to work with ``sums of money you would\nnever gamble with'' in order to get out of a fearsome market as fast as possible. G4, for\nexample, talked of getting more and more desperate as she and her husband trawled\ndifferent areas of the city. In the end, she said, ``I pushed our offer up quite signifi-\ncantly'' because ``I can't bear looking any more. I've had enough.''Another household,\nL4, described being ``really upset''about losing an earlier bid and ``really worried'' that\nthey would be priced out of the area\u00f6especially when they had put in a ``high offer''.\nFear drove their pricing decisions: it made it ``very difficult to think rationally about it\n[price]'' and encouraged them to bid a higher price than economic fundamentals\nsuggested. They recounted how losing out ``made us even more worried the second\ntime round ... we paid way over the odds for this just out of fear more than anything\nelse, that we'd better not lose another one.''\nFor the majority of the respondents, bidding a high price was one way to conquer\nthe fearsome market\u00f6to bring certainty back into their relationship with it and to\nbring to a close an encounter that had been ``stressful'',``horrible''and ``nerve wrecking''.\nG10's relief on buying a property was palpable despite the high price paid:\n``I felt it was a hunt that was over.''\nAnd many, like L4 above, felt uncomfortable about the prices they eventually paid\nprecisely because they recognised their complicity with the rising market:\n``we did the same [bid a high price] and we ... were really annoyed that we had to\nperpetuate this thing that someone else was gonna go `God, that's ridiculous that\nthey put in that offer'.''\nAn understanding of the role of emotions in housing markets, then, extends beyond\na description of the feelings embodied by an individual's interaction with the market to\nan analysis of the emotional discourses that they draw upon and how these generate\nconcrete economic effects. The use of emotive terms such as ``swamped'', ``haemorrhag-\ning''and ``desperation''evokes the sensation of individuals being overtaken by others in\nthe market and suggests that the buyers felt unable to cope with the new conditions.\nOverall, though, the households did manage to buy in a rising market where the lack of\npredictability, the dearth of useful information, and the desire to get out of it as quickly\nas possible all prompted them to bid higher than seemed sensible\u00f6to work with `silly\nprices' simply to bring closure to a process that seemed chaotic and uncertain. Again,\nit is the emotional scripting of the market terrain, and how people act on this, rather\nthan any economically rational assessment of it, which figures most significantly in the\nhouseholds' accounts. The next section shows that desperation is powerfully fuelled by\nother emotional qualities in housing, particularly by the love, hope, and anticipation\nwhich buyers experience in their relationships with specific properties. Bidding a high\nprice for a property is also driven by the buyers' emotional relationships with the\nobjects being traded: houses are not widgets, stocks, or shares\u00f6they are homes that\n2306 H Christie, S J Smith, M Munropeople fall in love with, or hope to make their very own, and that buyers are prepared\nto pay a high price for.\nWinners and losers?\n``It is, as I say, an emotional roller coaster in terms of you've got to really like the\nplace to offer for it. But you know you've got to keep your feet on the ground\nbecause you may well not get it'' (G6).\nAll of the study households conveyed their strong emotional reaction to the properties\nthey eventually bought. They spoke of their ``love'' of and ``feelings'' for the properties,\nof knowing that ``this is it, this is the one.''And they spoke too of the emotional values\nthey hoped to extract from the property\u00f6of their new homes as embodying desirable\nsocial and cultural identities. In this section we show that `rational' judgments about\nhousing are saturated with intense emotions\u00f6love, hope, and anticipation\u00f6which are\nnot adequately captured in more conventional accounts of house-price inflation. In this\nstudy, love for a property was narrated as the emotion that energised buyers to act\nwithin an uncertain market. And love\u00f6like fear\u00f6h a sam a t e r i a le f f e c to np r i c e .I tw a s\nout of love (or the hope for this affective tie to home) that the buyers undertook to pay\nhigh prices for specific properties, and which prices subsequently became a core element\nof the spiralling market uncertainty.\nAgain, economy and emotion interweave in ways that unsettle more conventional\naccounts of `irrational exuberance' in rising housing markets. Rather than explaining\nthe affective energy of the market by drawing on discourses of confidence and optimism\nabout house prices, the buyers referred to their love of and desire for the properties they\neventually bought. So for N6:\n``we just fell in love with it ... you know what it's like when you walk through the\nfront door and get this wonderful hall ... and we just said `this is where we want to\nlive.'''\nFor others, the potential pleasures to be extracted from the property were to the\nforefront of their discussion\u00f6the pleasures of finding a house that was ``perfect'' or\n``just the right thing'', of knowing ``we could be so happy here.'' Expressions of love for\nthe properties themselves were also bound up with emotional appeals to the status and\nidentity that ownership would bring. For L2, for example, making a purchase was a\nrite of passage, a transition to the adult world:\n``being a first-time buyer there's a great feeling of maturity buying a house ... you\nreally feel you've come into your own and you can be considered a grown-up.''\nAnticipation about different neighbourhoods was also a feature of the emotional\nallure of the properties. Love for a neighbourhood is about more than just the relation-\nship between buyer and area: it is also about choosing a spatial ideal, a place in which\nto identify with a particular image or lifestyle. And, of course, emotions are relational:\ndelineating a place of love, and moving towards it, is sustained by the lack of such\naffection and feeling for other (possible alternative) areas and desire to move away\nfrom them. The factors that buyers identified as cementing their desire for a particular\nplace were, unsurprisingly, differentiated across the neighbourhoods. In the high price\nneighbourhood, N, for example, great emphasis was placed on the aesthetic appeal of\n``the Georgian architecture ... if you afford to live in N it's the obvious place to be\nbecause it is so dramatically beautiful'' (N2). To love this area, and to want to live in it,\nwas an affective expression of a collective understanding that cultural identities are\nconstructed in relation to place.\nIn contrast to N, in G and M considerable emphasis was placed on the attractions\nof the local facilities, including good state schools and easy access to jobs, shops,\nThe emotional economy of housing 2307and green spaces; for many it was intimately bound up with an ideal of a (good) family\nlife. G2, for example, wanted to ``move within the [local school] catchment area\nbecause my son had been at [primary school] for several years and I didn't really\nwant him moving schools''. And although the property they ultimately bought fulfilled\n``all the requirements'' for the neighbourhood and the school, it was the feeling from\nthe house itself that was crucial to acting in the market and to making a high bid:\n``I felt instinctively ... that the house was right and it was perfect.''\nAnd in L, the low-price neighbourhood, much more appeal was made to the fearful\nconsequences of loss\u00f6of buying in less expensive or less desirable neighbourhoods,\nor even of leaving the city altogether. Delineating L as an area of love was suffused\nwith negative emotions about other places, about not living in ``dodgy'', ``miserable'' or\n``dumpy'' neighbourhoods.\nBut it is to the ways in which love, hope, and pleasure have a bearing on price that\nwe now turn. Desire for the right property\u00f6a property matched in all kinds of\nintangible as well as tangible ways with households' needs and personalities\u00f6became\nentwined with economic behaviour. As Ahmed (2004) suggests, the interesting question\nis about what these emotions `do', both in terms of how individuals draw upon them,\nand of how emotional discourses become entangled with economic behaviour\u00f6in this\ncase, with the decision to pay high prices for property. Love and desire for the property\ninfuse the buyer's actions in the market: they enable the households to name a positive\nemotion, something which allows them to bond with the market and which takes shape\nthrough such bonding. Across the sample as a whole the respondents described the\nprocess by which their emotional attachment to a house `stuck' them to the market and\nencouraged them to bid higher than seemed sensible to secure the sale. G10, for\nexample, commented that ``I just felt I was waiting for this house, that I had some\nfeelings for it in some way.'' To realise this love, to secure the object of their affection,\nthe households were prepared to bid a high price, and in this way the emotional\nrelationship assumed an economic form. G10 continued:\nMan: ``we pretty well bid our limit ...''\nWoman: ``I feel in the circumstances it was the right thing to do but I still think we'd\nhave got better value elsewhere or if we'd waited longer ... but I didn't think\nabout it very much. I feel we had to do that and I feel it's the price we had to\npay to get it.''\nAnd desire for the right neighbourhood also has an effect on price. High prices are\na way to realise the love, hope, and anticipation that buyers construct in their relation-\nship with the neighbourhoods they eventually bought into, as well as a way to avoid\nmoving to less appealing ones. L17 was fairly typical of the households buying at the\nlower end of the market where the potential disadvantages of moving to a less desirable\narea were sharpest. She was put off moving to another area where a lot of the flats\nwere ``just horrible ... stairs full of rubbish, entry phones didn't work and stuff like\nthat.'' To escape from this undesirable situation, she ``ended up paying more than\nI'd originally intended'' for a flat in L, which she regarded as an attractive location.\nThe emotional appeal of a`decent'area underpinned her decision to pay more than had\ninitially seemed economically rational.\nIssues about location, identification, and (high) price also open up for scrutiny the\nextent to which buyers orientate themselves towards or away from more conventional\nneoliberal accounts of economic behaviour as driven by financial and speculative\ncalculation. In the high-price area, N, much more direct appeal was made to the\ninvestment potential of the properties as a justification for paying a higher price.\nHere, emotional discourses about the buyers' relationship with the neighbourhood\nelided in a mutually constitutive way with the familiar scripting of housing as an\n2308 H Christie, S J Smith, M Munroeconomic investment. N1, for example, upped their offer at the very last minute and\ntalked about paying a high price for a`better address''compared with other areas of the\ncity they had looked at, in the expectation that they would ``get a lot more interest\nwhen it comes to selling.'' Love, in this neighbourhood, would be returned with\neconomic value.\nIn sum, then, participation in this market was not about the thrill of the chase, or\nabout making a market killing. Love of and desire for a particular flat or house can\neasily outweigh financial calculation or anticipated returns on investment, and is a\npotent element in the complex cocktail of emotions which suffuse market action. The\nemotional investment in making a connection with a possible home, with ideals and\ncollective identities, binds the buyer to the market, heightens and broadens the fear of\nanticipated loss, and underpins the decision to bid high prices for property, in ways\nthat are not adequately captured in conventional analyses of housing markets.Winning\nand losing in housing markets is only partly about buying, or not, an appreciating\nasset: it is also about securing, or not, an object of desire.\nConclusion\nIn this paper we have drawn on ideas about the social and relational character of\nemotions to broaden accounts of the emotional economy of housing beyond the\nrhetoric of individual psychology presumed in economic and psychological studies of\nhouse-price inflation. We set out to demonstrate what an explicit account of emotions\nmight add to our understanding of the housing transactions that take place in rapidly\nappreciating local markets. To conclude, we return to debates about the connections\nbetween economy and emotion that have the potential to animate accounts of housing-\nmarket behaviour: to accounts of how emotions become integral to ways of imagining\nand portraying markets, and to the implications of these emotional discourses for the\nexperiences of individuals, for the materiality and meaning of markets, and for the price\nof housing.\nFor Ahmed (2004), emotions are `things' which circulate and generate effects, and\nher work shows how emotional discourses are central to the making and shaping of\nindividual and collective bodies\u00f6such as markets. It is not enough simply to claim\nthat there is a connection between emotions and (economic) behaviour: instead, as we\nattempt to do here, it is more valuable to understand the particular connections\nbetween emotions and certain sorts of beliefs about what is valuable and important\nand how these are put into play in a particular instance. In our study, emotion,\nevidenced in respondents' narratives, shaped the market terrain as well as driving\nindividual actions. Constructing the market as a `frightening', `scary', and `alarming'\nplace, and Edinburgh as a `nightmare city' in which to buy property, was worked\nthrough tumultuous expressions of the desperation to move and the fierce desire for\nparticular kinds of properties or neighbourhoods, and brought forward into the high\nprice paid for housing. Our analysis shows that the `emotional economy' of housing\ntransactions depends on the interweaving of the meaning of home and the conduct of\nthe market.\nThere has been a tendency in economists' studies of (house) price bubbles to\nassume that the emotions associated with rapidly rising markets are drawn from a\nlimited range of positive feelings\u00f6most notably of buoyant confidence and optimism\nabout future (house) prices. Our analysis upsets these conventional interpretations\nof `irrational exuberance' by providing empirical evidence about the wider panoply of\nemotions which animate markets for housing. Emotions such as fear, desperation, and\nanxiety as well as love, hope, and anticipation, all infuse economic behaviour and help\nto explain why households pay seemingly irrational prices for property.We have argued\nThe emotional economy of housing 2309that calculations of future gains and anticipated losses may be as much, if not more,\nconcerned with considerations of emotional attachment and imagined loss than drawn\nfrom a calculus of expected price trajectories.\nFurther, while some previous work has foregrounded the emotional investment\nindividuals make in their homes, concentrating on themes of identity and ontological\n(in)security, these studies have tended to concentrate on the expressed emotions of\nindividuals rather than on the emotional terrain in which decisions are made. Our\nstudy is able to offer a more complex reading of the role of emotions within housing\nmarkets by scrutinising what the gamut of emotions actually `do', both by way of\nshaping the market materiality, and by way of infusing the encounters, actions, and,\nultimately, pricing decisions of the purchasers.\nAlthough we have chosen to study the role of emotions in a rapidly appreciating\nmarket, the findings have wider applicability as part of a larger process of opening up\n(housing) markets for scrutiny. Markets are experienced as emotional terrains whether\nthey are rising, falling, or relatively flat, although some particular emotional qualities\nmay be more evident and sharply experienced at a time of rising prices. While our\naccount does not attempt a systematic theorisation of the emotional economy of\nhousing-market activity, it does offer some pointers to the more complex and nuanced\nways in which emotional discourses shape the contours of housing markets and the\nactions of the buyers therein.\nAcknowledgements.
