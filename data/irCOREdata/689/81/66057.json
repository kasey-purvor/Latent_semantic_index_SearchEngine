INTRODUCTION\nThe principal hurdle in applying solid-state NMR to\ntypical organic compounds is the presence of strong dipolar\ncouplings between the protons. These are averaged to zero\nby rapid isotropic reorientation in solution-state NMR, re-\nsulting in narrow well-defined 1H resonances that are only\ninfluenced by the isotropic chemical shift and J couplings. In\nsolid samples, however, the dipolar couplings are not signifi-\ncantly motionally averaged and the presence of an extensive\nnetwork of dipolar couplings results in broad and featureless\nproton line shapes \u0001typically about 100 kHz wide\u0002. But since\nthe NMR interactions transform as rank 2 tensors, spinning\nsamples at an angle \u0001m=54.7\u00b0 with respect to the static mag-\nnetic field \u0003the angle that zeroes the second order Legendre\npolynomial, \u00013 cos2 \u0001\u22121\u0002 \/2\u0004 has the effect of averaging the\nanisotropic interactions. In general this averaging is only par-\ntial since it is not possible \u0001with existing spinner technology\u0002\nto spin samples very much faster than the width of the un-\naveraged spectrum. The appearance of the spectrum then de-\npends strongly on the nature of the Hamiltonian for the NMR\ninteraction responsible for the width of the spectrum. In the\ncase of so-called \u201cinhomogeneous\u201d interactions, such as the\nchemical shift anisotropy and heteronuclear dipolar interac-\ntion, the evolution of the density matrix is perfectly refo-\ncused over a rotation cycle, leading to sharp spectral\nfeatures\u2014center bands at the isotropic NMR frequency plus\nspinning sidebands separated by multiples of the rotation fre-\nquency.\nThe Hamiltonian for the dipolar couplings between a\nsystem of more than two like spins behaves very differently.\nThe Hamiltonian for a set of dipolar coupled nuclear spins is\nHdipolar\u0001t\u0002 = \u0005\nj\u0002k\ndjk\n\u0003\u0001t\u0002Tjk, \u00011\u0002\nTjk = 2IjzIkz +\n1\n2\n\u0001Ij+Ik\u2212 + Ij\u2212Ik+\u0002 , \u00012\u0002\nwhere the instantaneous dipolar coupling between a pair of\nspins, djk\n\u0003\n, is time dependent due to the sample spinning.\nExcept in the special case \u0001considered in Sec. III C\u0002 in which\nthe dipolar tensors share a common axis system, the different\nterms of Hdipolar do not commute since the spin terms Tjk do\nnot, in general, commute with each other \u0001\u0003Tjk ,Tkl\u0004\u00020 for\nj\u0002 l\u0002. As a result, the Hamiltonian for homonuclear dipolar\ncoupling network is \u201chomogeneous\u201d under sample spinning,1\nsince it does not commute with itself at different points in the\nrotation cycle, \u0003H\u0001t\u0002 ,H\u0001t\u0001\u0002\u0004\u00020. As a consequence, the spec-\ntral features \u0001centerbands and spinning sidebands\u0002 have a fi-\nnite width which only decreases relatively slowly with in-\ncreasing spin rate.\nIn spite of these limitations, specific 1H resonances can\nbe resolved for small to moderately sized organic molecules\nunder fast magic-angle spining \u0001MAS\u0002 \u0001greater than about\n25 kHz\u0002 and at high magnetic field \u0001greater than about\n400 MHz\u0002.2 This resolution is sufficient, for example, toa\u0002Electronic mail: paul.hodgkinson@durham.ac.uk\nTHE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 125, 144508 \u00012006\u0002\n0021-9606\/2006\/125\u000314\u0001\/144508\/13\/$23.00 \u00a9 2006 American Institute of Physics125, 144508-1\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

Exact treat-\nments seek to determine features of the 1H spectrum, such as\nlinewidths, starting from the complete system Hamiltonian\n\u0001although generally neglecting chemical shift differences\u0002.\nFor instance, average Hamiltonian theory has been used to\ndevelop a theory of proton linewidths under MAS.10 Deter-\nmining the average Hamiltonian over the MAS rotor period\nobscures, however, the different behaviors of center bands\nand spinning sidebands \u0001these differences are discussed fur-\nther in Sec. III D below\u0002. This limitation can be overcome, at\nthe expense of significantly increased complexity, using Flo-\nquet treatments.11\u201313 In general, however, exact treatments\nrapidly become intractable once more than two spins are in-\nvolved. The resulting expressions provide little insight into\nthe factors that determine what the effective 1H resolution\nwill be for a given sample and set of experimental condi-\ntions.\nA common alternative approach to an exact analysis in-\nvolves treating the effects of spin flips due to the couplings\nin stochastic terms using empirical memory functions,14 and\nthis approach has been extended to proton spin dynamics\nunder MAS.15 In a similar vein, the effect of proton-proton\ncouplings on 1H heteronuclear decoupling has been usefully\nmodeled in Liouville space using a superoperator represent-\ning spin diffusion.16 Although such approaches often provide\ngood models for the observed behavior, they generally in-\nvoke empirical parameters, such as a rate constant for \u201cspin\ndiffusion,\u201d and so lack predictive power; a true ab initio\ndescription would be able to predict the 1H linewidth simply\nstarting from a specification of the coupling network and the\nexperimental conditions.\nNumerical simulations would seem to avoid the com-\nplexities of exact analytical treatments of coupled spin sys-\ntems. However, conventional simulation techniques are\npoorly adapted for this task, as the computational burden\nincreases rapidly with the number of protons in the nuclear\nspin system \u0001approximately as 23n, where n is the number of\nspins\u0002. Efficient simulation codes which take advantage of\nthe relatively high sparsity of the nuclear spin Hamiltonian\nunder free precession, such as SPINEVOLUTION,17 can work\nwith up to about ten nuclear spins subject to MAS. This is\nabout the minimum needed to obtain realistic proton line\nshapes \u0001see below\u0002, but the calculation times are still becom-\ning prohibitive. Other published attempts to calculate ab ini-\ntio proton spectra under MAS have involved Floquet\nmethods.13 Unfortunately, these scale particularly badly with\nincreasing spin system size, and so the limit in this case was\nabout seven nuclear spins.\nAs we have previously described, however, the effi-\nciency of numerical simulation can be greatly increased if\nthe intrinsic periodic symmetry of a crystalline lattice is\nexploited.18,19 By symmetrizing the Hamiltonian with respect\nto the translational symmetry, the Hamiltonian can be further\nblock diagonalized, improving the calculation speed by or-\nders of magnitude. This either allows the number of spins\nconsidered to be significantly increased or permits a much\nlarger number of simulations to be carried out in a fixed\nperiod. In this paper, we describe how such calculations have\nbeen used, together with experimental measurements on a\nvariety of model systems, to determine the relationship be-\ntween the dipolar coupling network, the sample spinning\nrate, and the resulting 1H linewidths under magic-angle spin-\nning.\nAfter introducing the experimental and numerical tools\nin the following section, Sec. III shows how the homoge-\nneous linewidth due to the 1H dipolar coupling network can\nbe rationalized. 1H linewidths will also contain inhomoge-\nneous contributions due to factors such as \u0001static\u0002 disorder,\nbulk susceptibility broadenings, etc. These factors are con-\nsidered in Sec. IV. The final section considers other possible\ncontributions to proton linewidths, particularly whether\nchemical shift differences or anisotropies can have a signifi-\ncant impact, and discusses how these results for 1H can be\napplied to other abundant nuclear spins such as 19F and 31P.\nII. METHODS\nA diverse range of powdered microcrystalline samples\nwas chosen for experimental study, as set out in Table I.\nAlanine, glycine, and malonic acids are typical organic mo-\nlecular solids with a range of 1H environments and relatively\nstrong dipolar coupling networks. In contrast, the overall di-\npolar coupling strength is significantly weaker in adamantane\nand hexamethylbenzene \u0001HMB\u0002 due to internal motions,\nwhile the coupling network in d16-adamantane \u000196% deute-\nrium enrichment\u0002 is extremely weak due to the low concen-\ntration of protons \u0001in addition to the averaging of intramo-\nlecular couplings due to internal motion\u0002. HMB is also an\nexample of a system with large inhomogeneous broadenings;\nthe presence of stacked aromatic rings leads to a large aniso-\ntropy of the magnetic susceptibility \u0001Sec. IV\u0002.\nThe \u201ceffective dipolar coupling\u201d experienced by a given\nproton site, j, can be expressed quantitatively using the root-\nsum-square coupling,\ndrss,j =\u0006\u0005\nk\u0002j\ndjk\n2\n, \u00013\u0002\nwhere djk is the dipolar coupling strength between spins j\nand k. This can be regarded as a site-specific generalization\nof the second moment which is widely used to express the\ndipolar coupling strength in static samples where individual\nH sites are not resolved.20 We and others have previously\ndiscussed the significance of this parameter and its quantifi-\ncation from the 1H NMR spectrum.12,19 Table I gives esti-\nmates of drss for the different resolved 1H sites. In most cases\n144508-2 Zorin, Brown, and Hodgkinson J. Chem. Phys. 125, 144508 \u00032006\u0001\nDownloaded 26 Apr 2011 to 129.234.252.66.

It is important to note, how-\never, that the resulting drss values are extremely sensitive to\nerrors in measuring short H\u2013H distances; interproton dis-\ntances of less than 1.75 \u00c5 have been adjusted to a fixed\nvalue of 1.75 \u00c5 to facilitate consistency of comparison. As\ndiscussed further in Sec. III B, these uncertainties in estimat-\ning drss complicate the comparison of calculated and experi-\nmental linewidths. Moreover, vibrational averaging is known\nto lead to systematic differences between distances obtained\nfrom diffraction and those derived from dipolar couplings.21\nExcept in the case of adamantane, where these factors are not\nrelevant, the values of drss given above should therefore be\ninterpreted cautiously, since the uncertainties are estimated at\nabout 10%. In cases where extensive motional averaging\ncomplicated the calculation of drss from atomic positions, its\nvalue was estimated from fitting the spinning sideband inten-\nsities of the 1H MAS spectrum to a spin pair model.19 A\nsimilar level of uncertainty is predicted for these NMR mea-\nsurements.\nThe \u201cgeometry\u201d of the proton network is also expected\nto play an important role in the relationship between the\ndipolar coupling network and the observed linewidths. The\ninclusion systems formed between linear molecules and urea\nare interesting examples of quasi-one-dimensional arrange-\nments,22 where rapid rotation of the guest molecules about\ntheir axis means that the dipolar couplings within guest mol-\necules are averaged to their projections along the rotation\naxis. We have used the inclusion compound formed between\ndeuterated urea and decanoic acid, where deuteration of the\nurea reduces intermolecular couplings and reinforces the lin-\near nature of the spin system.\nThe NMR experiments used in this study are particularly\nstraightforward \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. The \u201cnatural linewidth\u201d was mea-\nsured from the full width at half maximum \u0001FWHM\u0002 of\nsimple pulse-and-acquire 1H spectra \u0003Fig. 1\u0001a\u0002\u0004. The homo-\ngeneous contribution to this linewidth was measured using a\nsimple \u0005\u2212\u0004\u2212\u0005 spin-echo experiment \u0001with the \u0005 values syn-\nchronized to multiples of the rotor period to avoid modula-\ntions as a function of the rotor phase\u0002. The intensity of the\ncenterband peak was measured as a function of 2\u0005 and fitted\nto a decaying exponential to obtain a phenomenological T2\nvalue \u0003Fig. 1\u0001c\u0002\u0004. The \u201cspin-echo linewidth\u201d is then 1\/\u0004T2.\nThe term spin-echoline width is used hereafter for this quan-\ntity since the physical significance of terms such as \u201chomo-\ngeneous linewidth\u201d is not clear, especially when strong side-\nbands are present \u0001this is discussed further in Sec. III D\u0002.\nThis terminology also avoids confusion with the distinction\nbetween Hamiltonians that are homogeneous versus inhomo-\ngeneous under sample spinning \u0001as discussed in the Introduc-\ntion\u0002. The natural and spin-echo linewidths were measured as\na function of MAS spin rate and static magnetic field for\nTABLE I.

The different fields and MAS\nprobes used are listed in Table II. As shown in the following\nsection, this allows us to build up a comprehensive picture of\nthe factors that determine 1H resolution under magic-angle\nspinning.\nThe principles behind the numerical simulations have\nbeen described elsewhere18,19 and will be only briefly sum-\nmarized here. We consider periodic systems based on a \u201cunit\ncell\u201d with a small number of spins. This is translated along\none or more axes to generate a periodic lattice, and the cou-\nplings between the spins are calculated using this geometry.\nPeriodic boundary conditions are imposed to ensure that the\ncouplings experienced by the different unit cells are identi-\ncal. The resulting nuclear spin Hamiltonian must share this\nsymmetry, and so must be block diagonal when expressed in\na suitable symmetry-adapted basis. With N unit cells, the\noriginal Hamiltonian will be divided into N blocks with the\nsymmetry-adapted states being distributed fairly evenly be-\ntween the blocks. Since the time-consuming steps \u0001diagonal-\nization, matrix multiplication, etc.\u0002 of numerical simulations\nare O\u0001n3\u0002 processes, the division into N blocks approxi-\nmately a factor of N smaller results in time saving of a factor\nof about N2. The reduction in matrix size also permits larger\nproblems to be considered. In particular, it is now feasible to\nverify that the behavior converges to a well-defined limit as\nthe number of cells increases.\nIII. SPIN-ECHO LINEWIDTHS UNDER MAGIC-ANGLE\nSPINNING\nFigure 2 collates the results of experimental measure-\nments of the spin-echo linewidth of the center band as a\nfunction of magic-angle spinning rate for the different sys-\ntems studied. Semianalytical theories10 predict that the 1H\nlinewidth should scale inversely with spin rate \u0006r, and so the\nplot shows linewidth versus 1\/\u0006r. Both horizontal and verti-\ncal axes have been made dimensionless by \u201cnormalizing\u201d\nagainst the effective dipolar coupling strength as measured\nby the root-sum-square coupling. This allows linewidths\nfrom systems with very different mean coupling strengths to\nbe directly compared.\nAt first sight, there seems little pattern to the overall\ndistribution of data points. Further examination, however, re-\nveals clear trends. For a given sample, the 1H linewidth is\napproximately inversely proportional to the magic-angle spin\nrate, with the relationship between the center band spin-echo\nlinewidth and MAS rate given by\nFWHM \u0007 G\ndrss\n2\n\u0006r\n, \u00014\u0002\nwhere G is a constant of proportionality that varies between\nsamples.

We can ne-\nglect the dipolar coupling to the 2H nuclei since this coupling\nis heteronuclear and will be refocused by the spin echo. If we\nassume that the substitution is random, i.e., \u0007 is independent\nof \u0005, then the effective coupling strength in the diluted\nsample is readily expressed in terms of drss for the nondiluted\nsample\ndrss\u0001\u0007\u0002 = \u0006\u0007drss. \u00016\u0002\nFor example, the drss values for adamantane and\n96%-d-adamantane in Table I are 6.0 kHz \u0001calculated from\nx-ray structure\u0002 and 1.2 kHz \u0001estimated from NMR\u0002, respec-\ntively. The ratio of drss values agrees exactly with \u00060.04\n=0.2, where \u0007=4%. Hence the spin-echo linewidth, from Eq.\n\u00014\u0002, is expected to scale approximately linearly with \u0007. The\nrelationship cannot be perfectly linear since the overall\n\u201cstructure\u201d of the 1H network, as measured by G, will also\nbe a function of the level of deuteration. Note how the slope\nof the data points for the deuterated adamantane sample in\nFig. 2 is distinctly different from that of the fully protonated\nadamantane since the network in the diluted system no\nlonger has a cubic symmetry and more closely resembles the\n\u201cintermediate geometry.\u201d This treatment in terms of a \u201ccon-\ntinuous proton density,\u201d which allows \u0007 to be extracted as a\nconstant parameter, may break down if the coupling network\nhas a strong \u201clocal structure.\u201d drss in an isolated CH2 group,\nfor example, will strongly depend on whether the other H\natom is 1H or 2H, and it would be more appropriate to de-\nscribe the NMR spectrum for the diluted system in this case\nas the sum of the responses from C1H2H and C1H2. These\nconclusions agree with recent experimental work in which\nthe 1H linewidth was found to increase monotonically with\nthe degree of protonation.29\nThese relationships between spin-echo linewidth and\nmagic-angle spinning rate are consistent between samples\nwith very different mean coupling strengths. For instance,\nthe curves formed from the data points from adamantane and\nthe acid proton of malonic acid are very close, as are the data\npoints from hexamethylbenzene and the NH3\n+ of alanine.\nThis confirms the utility of the normalization against drss, and\nallows us to use data from mobile systems to extrapolate the\ndependence on MAS for rigid compounds to faster spin rates\nthan currently \u0001or physically\u0002 available.\nAn important deduction from this ability to linearly ex-\ntrapolate towards infinite spin rate is that the spin-echo line-\nwidth for all the sample studies appears to decrease to zero in\nthis limit. This is even true for the deuterated adamantane\nsample where spin-echo linewidths as low as 5 Hz are ob-\nserved at the highest MAS rates \u0001see Ref. 50 for details\u0002. The\nlimit of the spin-echo linewidth is expected to be set by JHH\ncouplings \u0001which are not refocused by the spin-echo\u0002 and\nspin-spin relaxation \u0001T2\u0002. JHH are generally small, but it is\nmore surprising that the limit on resolution set by T2 relax-\nation is too small to detect \u0001in the presence of the linewidth\ndue to the dipolar coupling network\u0002. This implies that the\npotential of solid-state NMR in organic systems is not lim-\nited by T2 relaxation \u0001as often assumed\u0002, but only the effi-\nciency with which the homonuclear dipolar couplings can be\nsuppressed, e.g., by MAS or isotopic substitution.\nAnother clear feature of Fig. 2 is that the proportionality\ncoefficient between the local coupling strength and the spin-\necho linewidth varies strongly between samples. However,\nthese variations can be rationalized in terms of the geometri-\ncal arrangement of the coupled spins. For example, the ar-\nrangement of the protons in the urea inclusion systems is\nquasi-one-dimensional; rapid rotation about the tunnel axis\nmeans that all the intramolecular couplings are reduced to\ntheir \u201cprojection\u201d along the rotation axis, while deuterium\nsubstitution of the host urea molecules strongly reduces in-\ntermolecular couplings. It is well known that such a one-\ndimensional arrangement of spins behaves inhomogeneously\nunder magic-angle spinning. The couplings share a common\nset of principal axes, and so the dipolar coupling Hamil-\ntonian \u0003Eq. \u00011\u0002\u0004 commutes with itself at different points in\nthe rotor cycle, leading to a refocusing of the dipolar evolu-\ntion over each rotation period.1 It is not surprising, therefore,\nthat the 1H linewidth is much narrower in comparison to\nmore typical systems with similar values of drss. In contrast,\nthe cubic symmetry of the adamantane structure means that\nits network geometry is clearly three dimensional. This is\nassociated with significantly broader lines for a given drss \/\u0006r\nratio. The arrangement of protons within the malonic acid\nsystem lies somewhere in between, with strong dipolar cou-\nFIG. 2. \u0001Color online\u0002 Plot of spin-echo linewidths vs inverse spin rate for\nthe systems studied, normalized by the drss values shown in Table I.

The resulting linewidths are approxi-\nmately half that expected from a corresponding \u201cthree-\ndimensional\u201d \u00013D\u0002 system with the same drss. The linewidth\nfor a given sample is therefore expected to lie in the range\nGCH\ndrss\n2\n\u0006r\n\b FWHM\b Gcubic\ndrss\n2\n\u0006r\n, \u00017\u0002\nwhere the dimensionless constants GCH=0.04 and Gcubic\n=0.11 have been obtained by linear regression of the data\npoints for the CH of alanine and adamantane, respectively.\nThis relationship and the \u201cstructure constants\u201d are indepen-\ndent of the identity of the abundant spin \u0001which only influ-\nences the effective coupling strength via the magnetogyric\nratio\u0002. It should be emphasized, however, that Eq. \u00017\u0002 and the\nG coefficients given are simply intended as a rule of thumb\nfor estimating likely 1H linewidths for powder samples, as\nthe linear relationship between linewidth and inverse spin\nrate is only an approximation \u0001cf. Figs. 4 and 5\u0002.\nIn the following sections, we consider the different \u201cnet-\nwork geometries\u201d and attempt to predict the 1H linewidth\nand its dependence on the magic-angle spinning rate. This is\na key test of the hypothesis that 1H solid-state NMR line-\nwidths can be rationalized in terms of the strength of the\ndipolar coupling network modified by an overall effective\n\u201cdimensionality.\u201d\nA. 3D lattice: Adamantane\nThe three-dimensional lattice of adamantane is a particu-\nlar challenge for exact modeling since the simulation of a\ntrue three dimensional network rapidly becomes intractable.\nFor instance, a fragment of 3\t3\t3 cells with one spin per\ncell involves 27 spins, while the limit for manageable com-\nputations of coupled spin systems under MAS is about 15\nspins when exploiting periodic symmetry.18 We have chosen\ninstead to model the close-packed lattice of adamantane us-\ning a one-dimensional lattice with three spins per unit cell.\nThese are arranged in an equilateral triangle with the spacing\nbetween cells matching the internuclear distances within the\ncell \u0003Fig. 3\u0001a\u0002\u0004. This is a questionable model for the true\nphysical geometry, but it does capture something of the\nthree-dimensional nature of the lattice, with each spin being\ncoupled to four nearest neighbors at the same distance \u0001the\ntwo other members of the unit cell plus the corresponding\nspin in the two neighboring unit cells\u0002. The coupling strength\nis matched to that of adamantane via the root-sum-square\ncoupling. The drss has been calculated from the crystallo-\ngraphic data,26 and the resulting value, drss=6.08 kHz, is in\ngood agreement with a previous calculation11 which consid-\nered only closest neighbors \u0001i.e., most remote couplings\nmake negligible difference to drss\u0002. The unique internuclear\nseparation was then adjusted so that drss of the one-\ndimensional lattice matched 6.08 kHz \u0001corresponding to a\nnext-nearest-neighbor distance R of 3.44 \u00c5\u0002.\nFigure 3 shows simulated spectra using three and four\nunit cells \u00019 and 12 nuclei, respectively\u0002. Some individual\ntransitions can still be resolved when only nine spins are\ninvolved, but the spectrum is otherwise essentially identical\nto that calculated using four unit cells, i.e., the calculations\nhave \u201cconverged\u201d in the sense that further extensions of the\nspin system will have no visible effect on the spectrum at\nthis resolution \u0001set by the histogram bin width\u0002. Since the\nsharp features in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002 are easily ignored and the nine-\nspin calculation is much faster \u00016 min compared to 17 h on\nan Athlon 2800+PC\u0002, we used the three unit cell model in\nsubsequent calculations.\nAs inhomogeneous contributions to the adamantane line-\nwidth are negligible, we can directly compare these simu-\nlated spectra with the simple pulse-and-acquire spectrum ob-\ntained experimentally \u0003Fig. 3\u0001d\u0002\u0004. The agreement is\nremarkably good, particularly considering the distortions ap-\nplied to the lattice to fit it within the one-dimensional frame-\nwork of the calculations. It is also interesting to note that the\nspinning sidebands in both experimental and simulated spec-\ntra share a slight asymmetry \u0003Fig. 3\u0001e\u0002\u0004, which might other-\nwise be attributed to poor \u201cphasing\u201d of the experimental\nspectrum \u0001to obtain pure absorption line shapes\u0002. Although\nthe overall spectrum from a purely dipolar Hamiltonian must\nbe symmetrical and the sidebands must have the same phase\n\u0001for an isotropic powder sample\u0002,27 there is no theoretical\nrequirement for the individual sidebands from a homoge-\nneous Hamiltonian to be strictly symmetrical.\nIt is important to stress that the good agreement obtained\nbetween the experimental single-quantum spectrum and the\nsimulation obtained with a 12-spin system does not imply\nFIG. 3.

The evolution of the single-quantum\ncoherence of a given spin is largely determined by the strong\ndipolar couplings to the spins in the immediate vicinity, and\nonly a relatively modest number of spins are required to\ncreate a Hilbert space into which the single-quantum coher-\nence can smoothly dephase. In contrast, multi-quantum co-\nherences between several spins probe longer range and time\nscales and such \u201cspin counting\u201d experiments28 will, by defi-\nnition, require larger numbers of spins to be described cor-\nrectly.\nFigure 4 shows the MAS rate dependence of the calcu-\nlated center band widths. Again these agree very well with\nexperimental measurements, confirming that the simulations\nof the spin dynamics in the model network are sound. It is\nimportant to note that this comparison does not involve any\nadjustable parameters; the linewidth has been calculated\npurely on the basis of crystallographic information about the\nnetwork geometry, independently of any NMR measure-\nments. The agreement would be even more satisfying if the\nslope of the approximate line formed by the experimental\nand calculated points \u0003corresponding to the G \u201cstructure fac-\ntor\u201d in Eq. \u00014\u0002\u0004 could be predicted ab initio. Unfortunately,\nthis is an extremely complex problem,12 and the empirical\nrelationship between the local coupling strength and the re-\nsulting linewidth given by Eq. \u00017\u0002 is sufficient to provide\ngood estimates of the achievable resolution.\nB. \u201cIntermediate\u201d geometries\nIt is clear from Fig. 2 that the behavior of systems such\nas the CH2 protons in malonic acid is intermediate between\nthe limiting cases of one- and three-dimensional geometries.\nWe have chosen to model this system as a linear arrangement\nof spin pairs, with the internuclear distance between the pair\nmatching the H\u2013H distance within typical CH2 units ob-\ntained from crystallographic data.29 The intercell separation\nwas then adjusted so that the overall root-sum-square cou-\npling for an individual proton matched the drss for malonic\nacid given in Table I.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the agreement between the calcu-\nlated and experimental spin-echo linewidths is again good.\nThe differences between the mean of the experimental and\ncalculated data points are actually smaller than the variations\nbetween experimental points; for reasons that are not under-\nstood, the reproducibility of experimental data points was\nsomewhat erratic for this particular sample. It should be\npointed out, however, that there is considerable uncertainty\nin estimating drss for systems containing short H\u2013H dis-\ntances, as discussed in Sec. II, so the exact coincidence of\nexperimental and simulated points may be somewhat fortu-\nitous. This is, of course, independent of the question of how\nsuccessfully 1H linewidths in these intermediate geometry\nsystems can be reproduced using this simple 2-spins-per-cell\nmodel.\nC. 1D lattice: d4-urea\u00b7decanoic acid inclusion system\nAs discussed above, a purely one-dimensional geometry\nis a special case as it behaves inhomogeneously under spin-\nning, giving sharp spinning sidebands. The nonzero line-\nwidths obtained for the urea inclusion system in Fig. 2 are a\nresult of weak couplings between protons in different urea\ntunnels plus coupling to unsubstituted hydrogens in the\nnominally 100% d4-urea. Since the observed spin-echo line-\nwidths only reflect small deviations from the ideal geometry,\nthere is little interest in trying to model this system.\nIt is interesting, however, to consider the effect of small\ndeviations away from the linear geometry as this will turn an\ninitially inhomogeneous system \u0001with zero linewidth\u0002 into a\n\u201cnormal\u201d homogeneous system with finite linewidth. Figure\n6 illustrates this transition using a one-dimensional lattice of\nspin pair unit cells. When the spin pair internuclear vector is\naligned along the translation axis, the system behaves inho-\nmogeneously and the sidebands have zero width. But only\nsmall deviations from this geometry are required for the line-\nwidth to increase sharply. In this case, the system behaves\nhomogeneously for angles above 15\u00b0 \u0001similar curves are ob-\nFIG. 4.

The high mobility also results in reasonably\nshort relaxation times \u0001typical recycle delays are a few sec-\nonds\u0002, facilitating direct optimization on the sample. The ef-\nfects of magic-angle misset on 1H linewidths in more typical\nsystems can be neglected, provided that the magic angle has\nbeen verified on sensitive samples such as this one or more\nclassical setup samples, such as KBr.\nD. Center band versus sideband linewidths\nAs seen earlier in Fig. 3, center bands and sidebands\nhave different characteristics for a homogeneous Hamil-\ntonian. This is also clearly visible experimentally in Fig. 7\nwhich shows 1H MAS spectra of adamantane as a function\nof the spin-echo delay \u0001Fig. 1\u0002. The sideband intensity de-\ncays significantly more quickly than that of the center band.\nCuriously, despite adamantane being an extremely well-\nstudied model system and the distinction between center\nband and sideband characteristics having been made\ntheoretically,12 this experimental behavior seems not to have\nbeen previously discussed in the literature.\nSimulations on periodic model systems provide some in-\nsight into this behavior. As shown in Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002, simple 1H\nspectra calculated for different crystallite orientations are\nsurprisingly different despite the cubic symmetry of the lat-\ntice. In general, the shape and intensity of the center band is\ndistinctly different from those of the sidebands. At certain\norientations, the internuclear vectors between otherwise\nstrongly coupled spins lie close to the magic angle with re-\nspect to the magnetic field, and so the effective coupling\nstrength is relatively small, resulting in spectra dominated by\nthe center band and with relatively weak, but sharp side-\nbands \u0001dashed line\u0002. At other orientations, the effective cou-\npling strength is larger, and the sidebands are broader and\nmore significant \u0001solid line\u0002. The larger effective coupling\nwill also be associated with a more rapid decay in spin-echo\nexperiments. Although the linewidth and decay rate are both\ndetermined by the strength \u0001and nature\u0002 of the coupling net-\nwork, the connection between linewidth and spin-echo decay\nrate is not necessarily direct. This contrasts with linewidth\ndue to T2 relaxation in solution-state NMR where there is a\ndirect reciprocal relationship between the width of a reso-\nnance and the time constant for its decay \u0001FWHM=1\/\u0004T2\u0002.\nTo consider the effective coupling strength for individual\ncrystallite orientations \u0001as opposed to an average over an\nisotropic powder\u0002, we must include the dependence of the\ndipolar coupling on the orientation between the internuclear\nvector and the magnetic field, \u0001, when calculating the effec-\ntive coupling strength,\ndrss,j\n\u0003\n=\u0006\u0005\nk\u0002j\ndjk\n\u0003\n=\u0006\u0005\nk\u0002j\n3\u0001cos2 \u0001 \u2212 1\u0002djk\n2\n2\n, \u00018\u0002\nwhere drss\u0003 is used to distinguish the effective coupling\nFIG. 7. 500 1H NMR spectra of adamantane spinning at 5 kHz following a\nspin echo as a function of spin-echo period.

This ratio is infinite for one-\ndimensional geometries, since min\u0001drss\u0003 \u0002=0, but is still sur-\nprisingly large \u0001about 2.5\u0002 for spins arranged in a simple\ncubic lattice.\nHence, although sidebands and center bands have similar\nwidths for a given crystallite orientation, Fig. 8\u0001b\u0002, this is not\nthe case in the sum spectrum. The center band contains a\nhigher proportion of intensity from orientations with low drss\u0003\nvalues. As a result, it is markedly sharper in the spectrum and\nalso decays at a slower rate compared to the sidebands \u0001i.e.,\nits spin-echo linewidth is also narrow\u0002.\nFigure 8 also illustrates the limitations of the descrip-\ntions of multispin dynamics in terms of stochastic spin dif-\nfusion processes. Although such descriptions may be able to\nmodel signals from orientationally averaged samples, it is\nclear that the underlying dynamics are significantly more\ncomplex. While fitting experimental spin-echo decays from\npowder samples to simple exponential functions is a useful\nmeans of parametrizing the dynamics of a multispin system\n\u0001and is perhaps surprisingly successful\u0002, it is important to\nremember that the resulting T2 is a phenomenological quan-\ntity with limited physical significance.\nIV. INHOMOGENEOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO 1H\nLINEWIDTHS\nThe previous section considered the factors determining\nthe underlying homogeneous linewidth in 1H MAS line\nshapes \u0001as measured by spin-echo experiments\u0002. This was\nseen to be determined by the strength of the dipolar coupling\nnetwork relative to the sample spinning rate. This section\nconsiders inhomogeneous contributions to the linewidth, i.e.,\nthose components that are refocused by a spin echo. As the\ninhomogeneous contribution cannot be measured directly, we\ndefine it here as the difference between the natural FWHM\nlinewidth and the spin-echo linewidth obtained from fitting\nthe spin-echo decay to a phenomenological T2. As discussed\nabove, this fitting has its limitations and so the absolute val-\nues for the resulting inhomogeneous contributions should be\ninterpreted with care, especially when the homogeneous con-\ntribution is dominant and\/or the decay fits poorly to a simple\nexponential. This can lead to occasional examples where the\nspin-echo linewidth appears to be larger than the full natural\nlinewidth. The inhomogeneous linewidth can also be esti-\nmated by extrapolating plots of natural linewidth versus 1\/\u0006r\nto infinite spin rate,30 but this approach has its own limita-\ntions as such plots are not necessary linear \u0003Fig. 9\u0001a\u0002\u0004.\nFigure 9 shows the effect of magic-angle spinning on the\n1H linewidth of HMB. Here, aromatic ring currents and a\nhigh degree of \u0004 stacking in the crystal structure mean that\nthe magnetic susceptibility of the crystalline solid is strongly\nanisotropic, i.e., its anisotropy of the bulk magnetic suscep-\ntibility \u0001ABMS\u0002 \u0001\n\u000b\u0002 is particularly large. Although all solid\nsamples experience susceptibility broadening due to varia-\ntions in the bulk susceptibility from crystallite boundaries,\nvoids, etc., these are averaged away by magic-angle spinning\nif the material itself has an isotropic susceptibility \u0001i.e., \n\u000b\n=0\u0002. Magic-angle spinning is only partially effective, how-\never, for materials with a nonzero ABMS,31,32 resulting in\nbroadened lines for powder samples even under MAS. The\nlarge ABMS in hexamethylbenzene manifests itself as a large\ndifference between the spin-echo and natural width \u0003Fig.\n9\u0001a\u0002\u0004. As expected, this inhomogeneous linewidth is indepen-\ndent of the spinning rate \u0003Fig. 9\u0001b\u0002\u0004, but scales with the mag-\nnetic field, i.e., is constant when expressed in ppm. This\ncontrasts with the spin-echo linewidth \u0003Fig. 9\u0001c\u0002\u0004, which is,\nto a good approximation, independent of magnetic field\n\u0001when expressed in frequency units\u0002 and is strongly depen-\ndent on the MAS rate.\nThese magnetic susceptibility broadenings are often the\nlimiting factor in dilute-spin solid-state NMR,32,33 and previ-\nous studies of 1H natural linewidths as a function of spin rate\nand static magnetic field have suggested that they are also\nFIG. 9.

Table III shows estimates of\nthe inhomogeneous linewidths for two samples where the\ndifference between the spin-echo and natural linewidth is\nlarge enough to enable reasonable estimates of the inhomo-\ngeneous linewidth to be made. Even in these cases, the val-\nues are estimates due to the systematic errors in modeling the\nspin-echo decays from both 1H and 13C data as single expo-\nnentials; e.g., spin-echo decay rates from decoupled 13C\nspectra have been shown to vary with the 1H decoupling\nmethod.34 For comparison, an estimated value of about\n0.3 ppm was obtained in Ref. 30 for a more typical organic\ncompound, malonic acid, by extrapolating from data points\nacquired at very high spin rates and static magnetic field.\nMost sources of the inhomogeneous contributions, such\nas susceptibility broadenings, inhomogeneities of the bulk\nmagnetic field, etc., will be identical for all nuclei. Hence the\ninhomogeneous broadenings for different NMR nuclei in a\nsample are expected to be approximately constant \u0001when ex-\npressed in ppm\u0002. Table III shows estimates of the inhomoge-\nneous linewidths for 13C and 1H NMRs of a pair of samples\nwith substantial inhomogeneous broadenings \u0001essentially due\nto ABMS effects\u0002. This confirms that inhomogeneous line-\nwidths are essentially the same in ppm \u0001or, equivalently,\nscale with the magnetogyric ratio if expressed in frequency\nunits\u0002. The agreement is less good for the sample with the\nsmaller inhomogeneous contribution \u0001HMB\u0002, which prob-\nably reflects the uncertainties in the estimations.\nInhomogeneous contributions to dilute-spin linewidths\nhave been studied in detail for 13C MAS NMR,32,33 and so it\nis not necessary to revisit this existing work, given that the\ninhomogeneous broadenings are seen to be the same on both\nrare and abundant spins. It should be noted, however, that a\nbroadening of, say, 0.3 ppm due to susceptibility effects or\nsample disorder has a much smaller impact on 13C NMR,\nwith its large chemical shift range, in comparison to 1H\nNMR. Hence in many cases the intrinsic inhomogeneous\nbroadenings associated with powdered solids may represent\nan ultimate limit on the resolution of one-dimensional 1H\nNMR.30 Similar figures for inhomogeneous broadenings of\n\t0.2 ppm or less24,25 have recently been observed for\nsamples of microcrystalline proteins which have been par-\ntially deuterated to reduce the homogeneous linewidth. As\ninhomogeneous broadening factors are largely insensitive to\nisotopic substitution, this suggests that the inhomogeneous\nlinewidths are intrinsically low for these samples, which is\nencouraging for future solid-state NMR studies of this im-\nportant class of systems.\nAlthough the inhomogeneous linewidth will set the ulti-\nmate limit on resolution in simple one-dimensional 1H spec-\ntra \u0001including those obtained with homonuclear rf decoupling\nto suppress the 1H dipolar couplings\u0002, it is important to re-\nmember that the performance of many important experi-\nments is limited by homogeneous linewidth. For instance, J\ncouplings can be measured,35,36 and exploited for polariza-\ntion transfer,37,39 provided they are of least similar magnitude\nas the spin-echo linewidth, irrespective of whether they are\nresolved in the one-dimensional spectrum.\nV. THE INFLUENCE OF CHEMICAL SHIFTS ON\nABUNDANT-SPIN LINEWIDTHS\nThe previous sections have considered the proton spin\nsystem simply in terms of the dipolar couplings between the\nspins and ignored any potential influence of chemical shifts.\nThis is a common assumption when dealing with abundant,\nstrongly coupled spins and largely justified by the small 1H\nchemical shift range in typical organic systems. In particular,\nthe spread within crowded regions of spectrum, e.g., alkyl\nand aromatic regions, is extremely small in comparison with\nthe dipolar linewidth. A 2 ppm shift difference at a Larmor\nfrequency of 800 MHz, for example, corresponds to a fre-\nquency difference of only 1.6 kHz, in comparison to a typi-\ncal dipolar linewidth of \t100 kHz. The success of models\nbased purely on the dipolar coupling in explaining the line-\nwidths of individual samples and rationalizing the behavior\nof a wide range of proton-containing compounds, as de-\nscribed in Sec. III, is a strong indicator that chemical shift\neffects can be neglected as a factor in 1H resolution.\nIt is interesting to consider, however, the trends that\nwould be observed if the balance between the magnitude of\nthe chemical shift and dipolar coupling Hamiltonians were\nshifted, e.g., if working at extremely high magnetic field or\nstudying abundant nuclei with a much larger chemical shift\nrange, such as 19F. This section considers, firstly, the influ-\nence of large differences in isotropic chemical shift and, sec-\nondly, \u201crotational resonance\u201d effects associated with signifi-\ncant chemical shift anisotropies \u0001CSA\u0002 on the 1H linewidth.\nAs discussed above, it is rare to encounter differences in\nisotropic chemical shift between coupled protons that are\nsignificant in comparison to the local coupling strength. Trial\nsimulations confirm that typical 1H shift differences \u0001of up to\n10 ppm at a Larmor frequency of 500 MHz\u0002 have no signifi-\ncant effects on linewidth in typical organic solids \u0001using drss\nvalues of about 20 kHz\u0002. However, there are a few examples\nin the literature where partial averaging of the dipolar cou-\nplings or unusually large chemical shifts have shifted the\nbalance towards the limit where the shift differences exceed\nthe coupling strength. If we consider, for example, a dipolar\ncoupled spin pair with a difference in NMR frequencies of \n,\nthe nuclear spin Hamiltonian is\nH\u0001t\u0002 =\n\n\n2\nI1z \u2212\n\n\n2\nI2z + d\u0001t\u0002\n2I1zI2z + 12 \u0001I1+I2\u2212 + I1\u2212I2+\u0002\u000b .\n\u00019\u0002\nIn the limit that \n\fd, the Hamiltonian will be truncated to\nterms that commute with the chemical shift Hamiltonian; i.e.,\nthe \u201cflip-flop\u201d term of Eq. \u00019\u0002 can be neglected to leave an\nTABLE III.

I\u0002. In the\nintermediate case, where the differences in NMR frequencies\nare comparable to the dipolar linewidth, the 1H linewidth is\nexpected to decrease as the square of the spinning rate,40 i.e.,\nmuch faster than observed for systems where chemical shift\ndifferences are negligible.\nThe sample in Ref. 41, for example, contains two H\ntypes: H atoms in a mobile hydrogen molecule and relatively\nimmobile hydrogens in the surrounding cage. In the absence\nof sample spinning, the sites are coupled to form an extended\nnetwork, as shown by a featureless 1H spectrum and a com-\nmon T1 relaxation time. Only modest spinning, however, is\nsufficient to suppress the weak residual couplings between\nmobile hydrogen and the cage. As the two spin types have\nvery different chemical shifts \u0001a difference of about 15 ppm\u0002,\nwe would expect the two \u201creservoirs\u201d to be decoupled from\neach other. The resulting spectrum is the sum of extremely\nsharp peaks from the H2 and much broader peaks from the\nrigid cage, and distinct values of T1 are observed for the\ndifferent sites.\nAlternatively, the chemical shift range of the 1H sites\nmay be unusually large. Paramagnetic shifts in systems con-\ntaining unpaired electrons, for example, can result in isotro-\npic and anisotropic 1H shifts that are two to three orders of\nmagnitude larger than in typical diamagnetic compounds. In\nthese cases, 1H linewidths improve very rapidly with increas-\ning spinning rate.42,43\nRotational resonance is another mechanism by which\nchemical shift differences can influence line shapes in magic-\nangle spinning NMR.40,44,45 This occurs if the difference in\nresonance frequencies \n\u0006 between two coupled spins\nmatches to a small multiple n of the MAS rate. While rota-\ntional resonances with n\r0 \u0001typically n=1 or n=2\u0002 are eas-\nily achieved in, say, 13C-solid-state NMR, they are not com-\nmonly encountered in proton NMR since the small 1H\nchemical shift differences and the high spin rates required for\nuseful 1H resolution make the matching conditions difficult\nto achieve. As the static magnetic field increases, however,\nrotational resonance effects may be observed more readily.\nFigure 10, for example, shows a marked line broadening of\nthe CH2 resonance at the n=1 resonance at a 1H Larmor\nfrequency of 800 MHz.\nThe n=0 rotational resonance is an interesting case\nwhere two coupled spins have the same isotropic shifts, but\ntheir CSAs have different parameters, e.g., orientation of\nprincipal axes. This creates a Hamiltonian which does not\ncommute with itself at different points in the rotor cycle i.e.,\nis homogeneous. This is expected to occur readily for, say,\nCH2 units in solids since the isotropic chemical shift differ-\nences between the protons will tend to be small \u0001in the ab-\nsence of ring current effects\u0002,46 while the CSA orientations\nwill be different. Such a rotational resonance has a dramatic\neffect on the line shape in simple spin pair systems.40 Figure\n11 explores whether the same behavior is observed for\nabundant-spin systems. In this case where the Hamiltonian is\nintrinsically homogeneous, the effect is much less dramatic;\nthe CSA needs to be unrealistically large \u0001in proton terms\u0002\nbefore it has a noticeable effect on the spectrum \u0003Figs. 11\u0001c\u0002\nand 11\u0001d\u0002\u0004. In other words, the n=0 rotational resonance has\nFIG. 10. Example of rotational resonance in 1H NMR\nusing a sample of powdered malonic acid.

These\neffects should be more significant for abundant nuclei with\nlarger CSAs, although in practice it may be difficult to dis-\ntinguish between a small broadening due to rotational reso-\nnance and those due to dipolar couplings since they have\nessentially the same dependence on the MAS rate \u0001falling as\nthe inverse of spin rate\u0002.\nIn summary, the effects of chemical shift variations do\nnot appear to have a significant impact on 1H resolution in\nthe solid state, confirming the common assumption that only\nthe dipolar coupling network is important. Significant effects\ncan be observed in some atypical systems, or for abundant\nspins where the ratio of the dipolar linewidth to the size of\nthe shift variations is smaller, such as 19F and 31P.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nUnderstanding the dynamics of extended networks of di-\npolar coupled nuclear spins under magic-angle spinning is a\ndifficult problem. The system Hamiltonian is homogeneous\nin the sense that it does not commute with itself at different\ntimes, and so analytical treatments of the dynamics either\nbecome intractable in the case of exact treatments \u0001e.g., using\nthe Floquet theory\u0002 or invoke empirical factors such as\n\u201cmemory functions.\u201d Conventional numerical simulations,\non the other hand, are limited in the number of coupled spins\nthey can handle, creating the secondary problem of how to\nselect, say, ten spins from an extended network without the\nresults being distorted by boundary effects.\nNumerical simulation with model systems with one-\ndimensional periodic symmetry has allowed boundary effects\nto be avoided and greatly increased the efficiency of the cal-\nculations. Systematic experiments to measure the 1H line-\nwidths of a variety of model systems as a function of magic-\nangle spinning rate have provided a comprehensive set of\nexperimental points to compare with simulations. The intrin-\nsic homogeneous linewidth \u0001as measured by spin-echo ex-\nperiments\u0002 was found to follow clear trends, and the experi-\nmental values were reproduced in simulations based on\nstructural data from independent diffraction studies. Most\nnotably, the linewidths were found to decrease approximately\nlinearly with increasing spin rate with the gradient depending\non overall dipolar coupling strength for a given site, drss, and\ngeometrical factors which could be rationalized in terms of\nthe dimensionality of network geometry. Bearing in mind\nthat these results are obtained from powder samples and so\nrepresent some average over the different crystallite orienta-\ntions, the calculation of the gradient \u0001G\u0002 factors may be ame-\nnable to analysis. While the physical significance of the\nthree-dimensional and \u201cone-dimensional\u201d lattices is easy to\nappreciate, the significance of the intermediate cases may be\na fruitful direction for future enquiry\u2014could, for instance,\nthe \u201cG factor\u201d for a stochastic distribution of spins be calcu-\nlated analytically?\nSignificantly, it was not possible to measure limits on the\nspin-echo linewidth due to the relaxation processes that limit\nlinewidths in solution-state NMR, suggesting that there is\nsignificant room for developing experiments which are cur-\nrently limited by decoherence, e.g., by faster magic-angle\nspinning rates or using deuterium substitution to dilute the\nproton spin system and so reduce drss \u0001as well as scaling\nresidual linewidths due to J couplings by \u000e\u00011H\u0002 \/\u000e\u00012H\u0002\n\u00076.5\u0002.\nThe resolution limit in simple one-dimensional NMR ex-\nperiments is set by the inhomogeneous linewidth which var-\nies substantially between samples, from negligibly small for\nsystems such as adamantane to over 1 ppm for samples with\na highly anisotropic magnetic susceptibility. This contribu-\ntion was confirmed to be essentially independent of the\nnucleus under study, but this limit will have a much larger\nimpact on proton NMR resolution due to the small 1H\nchemical shift range. The small 1H NMR chemical shift\nrange also meant that chemical shift effects were found to\nhave negligible impact on 1H resolution.\nAs discussed in Sec. IV, it is important to remember that\nthe performance of many important solid-state NMR experi-\nments is limited by the rate of the underlying homogeneous\nmagnetization decay, rather than the simple one-dimensional\nresolution. Fast magic-angle spinning, especially in combi-\nnation with isotopic dilution, will lead to direct improve-\nments in experimental efficiency in these cases. Moreover\ntechniques involving tailored rf pulse sequences, such as\nFSLG,47 PMLG,48 and DUMBO,49 are, in principle, capable\nof suppressing the 1H dipolar couplings with much greater\nefficiency than simple MAS \u0001albeit at the cost of signifi-\ncantly increased experimental complexity\u0002. We are currently\napplying the same principles used in this study to the chal-\nlenging problem of understanding 1H resolution under both\nMAS and rf irradiation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported under Grant No. GR\/\nS56993\/01 from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Re-\nsearch Council.
