These results are discussed in \nterms of various models for substorm onset and place important constraints on any \nfuture models. \n \nWe also find that substorms showing a clear particle injection signature, as seen at \ngeosynchronous orbit, occur, on average, at higher values of open magnetic flux \nthan those showing varied or no injection activity.

Introduction \n \nThe subject of this thesis is the magnetospheric substorm. The substorm process results \nfrom the coupling between the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and the interplanetary magnetic \nfield originating in the Sun. The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the solar wind, \ninterplanetary magnetic field and the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere-ionosphere system, and the \ncoupling between them. \n  \n1.1 The Solar Wind and IMF \n \nIn the early twentieth century it was postulated that a stream of electrons emitted from \nthe Sun could penetrate the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (Birkeland, 1909), thus causing the \nnorthern lights. It was later realised (Birkeland, 1916) that in order to remain neutral the \nstream of particles must also contain an equal number of positively charged ions. It was \nfirst thought that the solar wind consisted of bursts of these electrically neutral streams \nof electrons and ions until Hoffmeister (1943) noted that the tail of a comet was not \nstrictly radial but lagged the radial direction by approximately 5 degrees.  \nBiermann (1951) postulated that the observations that comet tails always have a \ncomponent directed away from the Sun must be caused by a constant solar wind stream \nemitted by the Sun in all directions, interacting with the comet tail and pushing it away. \nParker (1958) demonstrated, though simple gas dynamics, that the high temperature and \nhuge pressure difference between the solar corona and surrounding interstellar medium \nallows the plasma to stream away from the Sun, overcoming the force of gravity. The \nexistence of the solar wind was soon confirmed by the first satellite observations made \nby Gringauz et al. (1960). \n \nSatellite observations have now confirmed that the solar wind mainly consists of equal \nnumbers of ions and electrons with the ion component made up of ~95% protons,  \n5% helium ions and trace amounts of heavier ions (Kivelson and Russell, 1995).  \nParker (1958) also showed that the solar wind speed increases with radial distance from \nthe Sun, reaching supersonic speeds by the time it reaches Mercury\u2019s orbit. Typical \nsolar wind properties at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun (  m, the distance \nfrom the Sun to the Earth) are shown in Table 1.1. The solar wind flow is not isotropic \n11105.1 \u00d7\n 1\n \n \n \nTypical Properties of the Solar Wind at near Earth Orbit \n \n \nProton Density 6.0 cm-3 \nElectron Density 6.0 cm-3 \nFlow Speed  470 km\/s \nDynamic Pressure 2.5 nPa \nMagnetic Field 7 nT \nTable 1.1: Typical properties of the solar wind and IMF at 1 AU (Pr\u00f6lss, \n2004). \n \nbut consists of three components of differing speeds, \u2018slow\u2019 flows of typically  \n300-450 km s-1 originating from active regions on the solar surface, \u2018fast\u2019 flows of  \n600-900 km s-1 thought to originate from coronal holes, and finally very high speed \ntransient flows possibly related to coronal mass ejections (Kivelson and Russell, 1995). \n \nDue to the high conductivity of the solar wind plasma, the Sun\u2019s magnetic field is \n\u2018frozen-in\u2019 to the solar wind (Baumjohann and Treumann, 1997) and carried with it into \ninterplanetary space. This magnetic field is known as the interplanetary magnetic field \n(IMF), varying in strength at the Earth from ~1 to greater than 40 nT. The Sun rotates \nwith an average periodicity of 27 days (slightly longer at the poles and slightly less at \nthe equator). This rotation causes the IMF to propagate outward from the surface of the \nSun in a spiral-like pattern known as the Parker spiral (see Figure 1.1a). During the low-\nactivity minimum of the 11 year solar cycle the radial component of the solar magnetic \nfield lines are directed into the southern hemisphere and out of the northern hemisphere. \nIn the next solar cycle this asymmetry reverses. By Amp\u00e9re\u2019s law, when there is a curl \nin a magnetic field a current must flow (see Baumjohann and Treumann, 1997). \nAmp\u00e9re\u2019s law thus requires a current sheet to form in the out-flowing IMF at the \nboundary between magnetic field lines of opposite polarity. This is illustrated in Figure \n1.1b and is known as the heliospheric current sheet. The Sun\u2019s magnetic field is not a \nsimple dipole field and contains many higher order terms. This complex nature results \nin complex \u2018ripples\u2019 in the heliospheric current sheet which are often likened to the \nfolds in a ballerina\u2019s skirt. As the Earth moves above and below the current sheet it will \nexperience periods when the IMF is directed away and towards the Earth, as well a \nlarge range of IMF clock angles (see Figure 1.2). \n \n1.2 The Magnetosphere \n \n1.2.1 Magnetospheric Regions \n \nThe magnetosphere is the region of near-Earth space governed by the Earth\u2019s magnetic \nfield. In the absence of any external influences, the Earth\u2019s magnetic field can be \napproximated to be dipolar, with its magnetic pole offset from the geographic pole by \napproximately 11\u00b0. Chapman and Ferrarro (1930) used a simple application of the \nfrozen-in condition (Baumjohann and Treumann, 1997) to postulate that the Earth\u2019s \n 2\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.1a: Representation of the Parker spiral assuming a constant radial speed of \n400 km s-1 and radial solar magnetic field (from Kivelson and Russell, 1995). The \nIMF is carried radially outwards from the Sun with the solar wind and forms a spiral \npattern due to the Suns rotation. \n \nBBr \nBBz \n \n \nFigure 1.1b: Schematic representations of the warp in the heliospheric current sheet \nand how the Earth will experience different orientations of IMF as it moves through it \n(adapted from Pr\u00f6ss, 2004), where usw is in the direction of radial solar wind flow and \nBBz and BrB  are the north-south and radial components of the IMF in the frame of \nreference of the Earths magnetic axis. \nGeomagnetic North \n \n   \n  z \nIMF Bz > 0 \nIMF By < 0 IMF By > 0 \n\u03b8c \nDawn Dusk \n \n y \nIMF \nIMF Bz < 0 \n \nGeomagnetic South \n \n\u03b8c = arctan(|B  By| \/ BzB ) 0 \u2264 \u03b8c \u2264 \u03c0 \n \n \nFigure 1.2: Definition of the IMF clock angle and GSM coordinate system. \nHere we are looking from the Sun toward the Earth along the Sun-Earth line. \nIn the geocentric solar magnetic (GSM) coordinate system zero X, Y and Z is \nlocated at the center of the Earth. The X component is directed along the Sun-\nEarth line in and out of the plane of the page. Positive X is toward the Sun \nwith negative X behind the Earth. The Z component is perpendicular to X and \nis in the plane of the Earth\u2019s dipole. Hence IMF BBz < 0 is oppositely directed \nto the northward magnetic field of the Earth. The Y component is directed \nalong the dawn-dusk line, with positive Y in the direction of dusk. The IMF \nclock angle (\u03b8c) is defined as the angle made by the IMF with geomagnetic \nnorth in the GSM Y-Z plane. \nmagnetic field must create a cavity in the solar wind, whose outer boundary separates \nplasma of terrestrial and solar origin. This cavity is called the magnetosphere. Figure \n1.3 shows a schematic of the main regions of the magnetosphere, where the Sun is \nlocated to the left of the figure. \n \nThe first feature to be encountered on the far left hand side of Figure 1.3 is the bow \nshock, first postulated by Axford (1962) and Kellogg (1962). The information needed to \ndeflect the solar wind flow around the magnetosphere travels at a velocity less than the \nsolar wind flow speed. This results in the bow shock located at approximately 14 RE \nfrom the center of the Earth where the supersonic solar wind flow brakes to subsonic \nspeeds. \n \nAs the solar wind plasma is slowed through the bow shock region it is also heated and \ncompressed such that a region of hot, compressed solar wind plasma forms between the \nbow shock and magnetopause. This region of \u2018shocked\u2019 solar wind has a density and \nmagnetic field strength approximately four times that in the un-shocked solar wind and \nis known as the magnetosheath. The plasma of the magnetosheath can gain direct entry \nto the magnetosphere and ionosphere (section 1.3) through the cusp, mantle and dayside \nentry layer regions (see below). \n  \nThe boundary between the magnetosphere and solar wind is known as the \nmagnetopause, and was first postulated by Chapman and Ferraro (1931). Typically the \nnose of the magnetopause is located at ~10 RE, its exact location depending on the \nbalance between the ram pressure of the solar wind and magnetic pressure of the \ndayside magnetosphere. There is a large gradient between the strength of the shocked \nIMF and terrestrial magnetic field at the magnetopause and thus by Amp\u00e9re\u2019s law a \ncurrent must flow. On the dayside magnetopause this current flows in the dawn-dusk \ndirection and closes over the tail lobes and in the magnetotail (Pr\u00f6lss, 2004). \n \nThe cusp region exists at the neutral point between dayside magnetic field lines and the \nnightside field lines of the lobes and is often defined as the region of direct entry of \nsolar wind plasma into the magnetosphere (Heikkila and Winningham, 1971). \nExtending equatorward from the cusp is the dayside entry layer. Here the plasma \ndensity is nearly as high as in the magnetosheath (Haerendel and Paschmann, 1975; \n 3\n   \n \nFigure 1.3: Schematic of the regions of the magnetosphere (from Kelley, 1989). \nPaschmann et al., 1976). At the equator, the entry layer extends around the \nmagnetosphere in the plane of the equator into a layer known as the low-latitude \nboundary layer (LLBL, not shown in Figure 1.3). The LLBL (e.g. Eastman et al., 1976; \nFujimoto et al., 1998) consists of particles from a mixture of both magnetosheath and \nmagnetospheric origins. The high latitude extension of the cusp is termed the mantle \n(Rosenbauer et al., 1975). Particles from these regions can gain direct entry to the \nEarth\u2019s upper atmosphere and thus play an important role in the creation of the dayside \nauroral emission (see section 1.3.4). \n \nWhile the dayside magnetosphere is compressed by the solar wind flow, the tail of the \nmagnetosphere is stretched several hundred RE downtail. The northern and southern \nlobes of the tail are open. That is, they have one magnetic footprint connected to the \nsurface of the Earth and the other ultimately connected to the solar surface. The closed \nmagnetic field line region at the center of the tail is known as the plasma sheet, which \ncan be broken down into two regions. The boundary plasma sheet is a thin hot layer of \nmostly field-aligned plasma which surrounds the thicker and denser central plasma \nsheet (CPS). The large gradient between the oppositely directed field lines of the \nnorthern and southern lobes requires a current by Amp\u00e9re\u2019s law. This results in a dawn-\ndusk current flowing near the center of the plasma sheet, known as the cross-tail current \nor neutral sheet. \n \nWithin the closed field line region of the plasma sheet, and extending round to the \ndayside, lies the radiation belt region. The radiation belts consist of two separate regions \nof hot, trapped particles, mirroring (see Figure 1.4 and section 1.2.2) between the \nnorthern and southern poles as well as gradient and curvature drifting (see below and \nFigure 1.4) around the Earth. Between ~1.1 and 3.3 RE, in the equatorial plane, lies the \ninner radiation belt region where the maximum flux of the most energetic protons  \n(~ 4-50 MeV) in the magnetosphere resides. The inner radiation belt region has a fairly \nstable population which may vary due to geomagnetic storms and with the 11 year solar \ncycle. The outer radiation belt lies at ~3-9 RE, covering geosynchronous orbit (6.6 RE), \nand is much more dynamic than the inner belt. The outer belt is the region of maximum \nflux for energetic electrons within the magnetosphere (Pr\u00f6lss, 2004). Typical electrons \nenergies are between 20-200 keV but can be as high as 10 MeV  \n(e.g. Krimigis et al., 1985). The outer radiation belt is thought to be highly modulated \n 4\n Figure 1.4: Motion of particles trapped on closed magnetic field lines (from \nPr\u00f6lss, 2004). Top: Magnetic mirroring. Particles travelling along magnetic field \nlines into a converging magnetic field will feel a force perpendicular to the \nmagnetic field direction which has a component pointing away from direction of \nincreasing field. Hence the velocity of the particle in the direction of converging \nfield decreases until it is reversed such that the particle changes direction along \nthe field lines. The point at which the particles direction reverses is called the \nmirror point. If the particles mirror point is within the upper atmosphere, the \nparticles may interact with atmospheric neutrals, the source of auroral emission \n(Baumjohann and Treumann, 1997).  \nBottom: Particle motion due to mirroring and gradient and curvature drift. When \nthere is a gradient in the magnetic field strength (the Earth\u2019s magnetic field \nstrength decreases away from the Earth) such that the length scales of the \ngradient is comparable to the gyro-radius of particles traversing the magnetic \nfield lines, as well mirroring between the hemispheres of the Earth, the particles \nwill also feel a force perpendicular to both the direction and gradient in magnetic \nfield. This is called the gradient drift. A related drift is the curvature drift which \noccurs due to the curvature of field lines such that the magnetic field direction \nchanges along it (see Pr\u00f6lss, 2004). Both gradient and curvature drift are charge \ndependent such that electrons drift eastwards and protons drift westwards around \nthe Earth (Pr\u00f6lss, 2004). \nby the injection of energetic particles during substorms (see chapter 2) and storms (see \nMcPherron et al., 2008) and plays a major role in modulating the strength of the ring \ncurrent (see below). \n \nAs well as mirroring between the two hemispheres of the Earth, particles trapped on \nclosed magnetic field lines also feel a gradient and curvature drift (Baumjohann and \nTrumann, 1997 and Figure 1.4) such that electrons drift eastward around the Earth and \nions drift westwards. The energetic particles of the outer radiation belts can complete an \nentire orbit of the Earth in only a few minutes (e.g. Liemohn and Chan, 2007). The \nrelative motion of trapped ions and electrons creates a current flowing in the westwards \ndirection between ~ 2-7 RE, overlapping the radiation belt region, known as the ring \ncurrent (see Figures 1.3 and 1.4). The strength of the ring current, as measured by \nground-based instrumentation (see section 3.6) is a good indicator of the level of \ngeomagnetic\/storm activity of the magnetosphere (e.g. Frank, 1967). \n \nInside of and overlapping the radiation belt region lies the region known as the \nplasmasphere. The plasmasphere lies Earthward of the inner edge of the plasma sheet. \nThis is a region of cold, dense plasma that has escaped from the ionosphere, and which \nco-rotates with the Earth. The outer edge of the plasmasphere is known as the \nplasmapause and has been shown to often lie between 3-5 RE (Kivelson and Russell, \n1995). \n  \n1.2.2 Magnetic Reconnection and the Dungey Cycle \n \nIn the Chapman-Ferraro magnetosphere, the magnetosphere is considered to be \ncompletely closed to the solar wind due to the frozen-in condition, which states that an \ninfinitely conducting plasma in a magnetic field is frozen-in to the magnetic field such \nthat plasmas travelling in two different magnetic field line regions cannot mix. \nHowever, Dungey (1961) proposed that when the IMF is strongly southward, that is, \noppositely directed to the northward terrestrial field lines near the nose of the dayside \nmagnetosphere, a process known as magnetic reconnection can occur at the dayside \nmagnetopause, allowing the two different magnetic field and plasma regions to conjoin. \nA schematic representation of the reconnection process is shown in Figure 1.5. When \ntwo oppositely directed magnetic field lines come together they enter the region known \n 5\n \nFigure 1.5: Schematic representation of magnetic reconnection (adapted from \nKivelson and Russell, 1995). Oppositely directed magnetic field lines travel into the \ndiffusion region from above and below, join at the reconnection x-line where they \nsplit into two separate field lines which subsequently travel away from the diffusion \nregion in the perpendicular direction. \nas the diffusion region. Here, the characteristic length scale of the plasma becomes short \nenough that diffusion becomes important such that the magnetic field can become \ndecoupled from the plasma. In the diffusion region the frozen-in approximation no \nlonger holds and reconnection occurs along what is known as a reconnection x-line, or \nneutral line (where the total magnetic field strength is zero). Magnetic field lines flow \ninto the diffusion region, from the top and bottom of the figure, where they join at the \nneutral line and split perpendicular to the neutral line such that two new field lines are \nformed. The highly kinked nature of these new field lines imposes a large magnetic \ntension upon them such that the field lines are accelerated away from the reconnection \nsite in the perpendicular direction (Kivelson and Russell, 1995). Plasma travelling along \nthe magnetic field lines of the two separate regions now finds itself on field lines which \nare continuous across the two previously separate field line regions such that plasma of \nthe two different regimes can mix. \n \nIn the proposed model by Dungey (1961), reconnection can occur at both the dayside \nmagnetopause and within the magnetotail, completing what is known as the Dungey \ncycle. The proposed model explained many of the observation features of the \nmagnetosphere, including the twin cell convection pattern (see below), the stretched tail \nof the magnetotail (e.g. Wolfe et al., 1967), the erosion of dayside closed magnetic flux \nduring extended periods of southward IMF (e.g. Aubry et al., 1970; Holzer and Slavin, \n1979) and the increased magnetospheric activity during southward IMF (e.g. Fairfield \nand Cahill 1966; Fairfield, 1967). The Dungey cycle is represented schematically in \nFigure 1.6a and summarised below. \n  \nWhen the IMF is oppositely directed to the northward terrestrial field lines at the sub-\nsolar point, the first closed terrestrial magnetic field line (having both footprints \nconnected to the surface of the Earth) at the dayside magnetopause is split in two by \nreconnection (point a, Figure 1.6a), creating two new field lines each with one magnetic \nfootprint connected to either the northern or southern pole of the Earth, and the other \nultimately to the surface of the Sun (field line b, Figure 1.6a). These field lines are \ncalled open magnetic field lines and contribute to the amount of open magnetic flux \nthreading the magnetosphere. These open magnetic field lines are quickly swept back \nover the northern and southern poles by the solar wind flow (b-d), and form the long tail \nof the magnetosphere known as the magnetotail. Dungey (1965) estimated that field \n 6\nlines remain open for approximately 4 hours before they become close enough in the \ntail to be reclosed through reconnection at what is known as the distant neutral line \n(DNL), point e. Reconnection at the distant neutral line recloses open magnetic field \nlines, forming both Earthward and tailward moving loops of closed magnetic flux which \nhave both footprints connected to the surface of the Earth and solar corona respectively. \nSpacecraft observations of the plasma outflow from the DNL reconnection site place the \nDNL at a distance of approximately 100-150 RE downtail (e.g. Slavin et al., 1985). \nClosed field lines ejected tailward continue to move away from the Earth while the \nEarthward moving flux tubes convect around the Earth at low latitudes in both \ndawnward and duskward directions (f-g) to replenish the flux opened on the dayside. \n \nThe open magnetospheric magnetic field lines map to the high latitude region over the \npoles in a region known as the polar cap (see Figure 1.6b). Particles on open magnetic \nfield lines will mirror only once near one of the poles of the Earth before continuing \ntheir long journey down their open magnetic field lines. Equatorward of the polar cap \nlies the closed magnetic field region. Since the Earth\u2019s magnetic field converges at the \npoles, particles travelling along these field lines will mirror (change direction) as they \nreach the poles (Pr\u00f6lss, 2004, see Figure 1.4), bouncing between the two hemispheres of \nthe Earth. When the mirror point is at a low enough altitude to penetrate the upper \natmosphere of the Earth they can interact with atmospheric particles, creating the bright \nring of auroral emission known as the auroral oval (Figure 1.3). The boundary between \nopen and closed magnetic field lines is known as the open\/closed magnetic field line \nboundary, or OCB. Figure 1.6b shows the motion of magnetic field lines across the \nnorthern polar cap during the Dungey cycle, as viewed from above. The motion of the \nfield lines is shown by the dashed lines, the magnetic field is directed into the page and \nthe induced electric field (see Baumjohann and Treumann, 1997) direction is shown by \nthe arrows. In the upper layers of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere\/ionosphere (see below) plasma \nis coupled to the magnetic field and moves with it. The pattern formed by the motion of \nfield lines and plasma is known as the ionospheric convection pattern (e.g. Cowley and \nLockwood, 1992). \n \n \n \n \n 7\n \nFigure 1.6a: Schematic of the Dungey cycle (from Milan et al., 2003). \n \n \n \nFigure 1.6b: Schematic of the Dungey cycle as seen from above the northern polar \ncap (from Pr\u00f6lss, 2004). Dashed lines show the motion of magnetic field lines across \nthe polar cap, known as the ionospheric convection pattern. The magnetic field is \ndirected into the page and the arrows show the direction of the electric field in the \nionosphere. \n1.2.3 The Expanding-Contracting Polar Cap \n \nThe polar cap in any one hemisphere is defined as the area threaded by open magnetic \nflux. Magnetic reconnection at the dayside magnetopause adds open magnetic flux to \nthe magnetospheric system, thus acting to increase the size of the polar cap. Conversely, \ntail reconnection closes open magnetic flux and works to decrease the size of the polar \ncap. The rate of change in polar cap size can thus be expressed in terms of the day and \nnightside reconnection rates as follows: \n \nNDpc\npc dtdF\ndt\ndA\nB \u03c6\u03c6 \u2212== \/)( ,      (1.1) \n \nwhere B is the magnetic field strength of the Earth (assumed to be constant everywhere \nacross the polar region, which is only an approximation), Apc is the area of the polar cap, \nFpc is the amount of open magnetic flux threading the polar cap, D\u03c6  and N\u03c6  are rates of \nday and nightside reconnection respectively. This is a simple formulation of Faraday\u2019s \nlaw, magnetic flux inside a closed loop must be equal to the electric field integrated \naround the loop, applied to the ionosphere where the closed loop is the OCB. D\u03c6  and \nN\u03c6  are voltages associated with the opening and closing of flux on the dayside and \nnightside. The electric field is associated with convective flow in the ionosphere (Siscoe \nand Huang, 1985; Lockwood and Cowley, 1992). \n \nIn the original definition of the Dungey cycle the dayside and nightside reconnection \nrates were considered to be equal. However, many studies have since shown that the \npolar cap size is highly variable (see section 2.4). This result is easily explained by a \nDungey cycle in which the dayside reconnection is not a steady process but responds to \nchanges in the orientation of the IMF. Indeed, it is known that the IMF is highly \nvariable and can switch between northward (no dayside reconnection) and southward \n(dayside reconnection proceeds) orientations over time scales of a few minutes (e.g. see \nFigures 3, 4 and 5 of Milan et al., 2009b). While the rate of dayside reconnection will \ndepend on the orientation and strength of the IMF, the rate of nightside reconnection \nwill be dependent on the conditions within the magnetotail, which are in turn controlled \nby the level of dayside reconnection. However, it takes at least 30 minutes for \n 8\ninformation on dayside reconnection to be transported to the tail (Cowley and \nLockwood, 1992). Nightside reconnection thus cannot respond to changes at the dayside \ninstantaneously and it is expected that day and nightside reconnection rates will rarely \nbe in balance. This leads to an expansion and contraction of the polar cap area as \ndiscussed by Russell (1972), Siscoe and Huang (1985), Cowley and Lockwood (1992), \nLockwood and Cowley (1992), Taylor et al. (1996), Milan et al. (2003, 2006, 2007) and \nLockwood et al. (2005). \n \nFigure 1.7 shows a schematic representation of the response of the polar cap and \nionospheric convection pattern to different rates of day and nightside reconnection, \nassuming that the equilibrium position of the OCB is circular.  Panel a shows the \nresponse for a burst of dayside reconnection only. The solid part of the elongated circle \nrepresents the location of the OCB at the start of a period of enhanced dayside \nreconnection. The low-latitude reconnection site at the dayside magnetopause maps to \nthe dot-dashed line around 12 noon, known as the merging gap, co-located with the \nOCB. As the dayside reconnection proceeds the merging gap portion of the OCB \nquickly moves to lower latitudes to encompass the region of newly opened magnetic \nflux around 12 noon. As the newly-opened field lines are subsequently dragged across \nthe polar cap (their motion shown by the arrowed lines), plasma flows are induced in \nthe ionosphere which redistribute the newly opened flux around the polar cap as the \npolar cap tries to relax back to its circular configuration. This results in a poleward \nmotion of the merging gap portion of the OCB and an equatorward motion of the OCB \nat all other MLTs. If the dayside reconnection were to be turned off (and there is no \nnightside reconnection such that open flux is neither added nor removed from the polar \ncap) the OCB would relax to the location shown by the dot-dashed circle and the flow \nwould die away as this happens. \n \nPanel b represents the equivalent pattern for an entirely nightside burst of reconnection. \nIn this scenario nightside reconnection eats into the open flux of the polar cap near \nmidnight, resulting in the poleward motion of the nightside merging gap. The OCB at \nother local times slowly moves to higher latitudes as the flux is redistributed throughout \nthe polar cap. The dot-dashed circle again represents the location of the OCB if \nreconnection were to be subsequently turned off. \n \n 9\n Figure 1.7: Schematic of the expanding and contracting nature of the polar \ncap for a burst of dayside reconnection (panel a), a burst of nightside \nreconnection (panel b) and balanced dayside and nightside reconnection \n(panel c) (from Cowley and Lockwood, 1992). The dashed line shows the \nlocation of the ionospheric merging gap and the solid circle represents the \nlocation of the OCB at all other local times. The dashed-dot line represents \nthe final location of the OCB if reconnection where to be turned-off after a \nperiod of dayside (panel a) or nightside (panel b) reconnection. The arrowed \nlines show the ionospheric convection pattern. \nIn reality both day and nightside reconnection proceed in tandem. This scenario is \nrepresented in panel c of Figure 1.7 for completely balanced day and nightside \nreconnection. Here the OCB remains at a fixed location as the convection of open \nmagnetic flux into the polar cap at the dayside equals the convection of open magnetic \nflux out of the polar cap on the nightside. However, as discussed above, day and \nnightside reconnection rates are rarely in balance resulting in an expansion or \ncontraction of the polar cap, depending on which process is dominant. \n \nUnder northward IMF magnetic reconnection can also occur in one or both \nmagnetospheric lobes under certain conditions. Dual lobe reconnection, reconnection \noccurring between the IMF and open lobe field lines in both tail lobes simultaneously \nsuch that the same IMF field line is reconnected in both hemispheres, can occur when \nthe IMF is strongly northward and the BBy component is close to zero such that the IMF \nis oppositely directed to the terrestrial field in both lobes at high latitudes  \n(e.g. Dungey, 1963, Imber et al. 2006, 2007). This type of reconnection results in the \nclosure of open magnetic flux. When the IMF BzB  component is strongly northward but \nthe IMF BBy component is not close to zero the IMF can drape around the magnetosphere \nsuch that reconnection occurs in one lobe only. This type of reconnection is called \nsingle lobe reconnection (e.g. Dungey, 1963; Russell, 1972; Reiff, 1985;  \nMilan et al., 2000). Since reconnection occurs on already open magnetic field lines, no \nnew open flux is created. Instead the open flux within the polar cap is \u2018stirred\u2019.  \n \n1.3 The Ionosphere and Auroral Precipitation \n \n1.3.1 The Ionosphere \n \nDue to solar UV radiation, the upper part of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is partially ionized. \nThis region is known as the ionosphere. The ionosphere can be broken down into \nseveral different regions illustrated in Figure 1.8. The lowermost region, between 50 \nand 90 km above the Earth\u2019s surface, is known as the D region and is only present \nduring the day. The E region exists between ~90 and 130 km and is more highly ionized \nthan the D region. The uppermost region, the F region, extends from ~ 170 km to  \n~250 km and can be split into two separate region, F1 and F2 (Kivelson and Russell, \n1995). The upper ionosphere is highly coupled to the magnetosphere and convects with \n 10\n Figure 1.8: Regions of the ionosphere (from Kivelson and Russell, \n1995). \nthe motion of magnetic fields (see below). The lower part of the ionosphere becomes \ndecoupled from the magnetic field due to collisions with atmospheric particles and \nmoves with the atmospheric winds, as well as co-rotating with the Earth. \n \n1.3.2 Ionospheric Currents \n \nSeveral currents flow within the ionosphere and have importance for the work carried \nout in this thesis. These currents are summarised below and for the northern polar cap in \nFigure 1.9. \n \nWhen particles are frozen-in to magnetic field lines it can be shown that in the presence \nof an electric field the particles will move in the direction given by BE \u00d7 , where E and \nB are the electric and magnetic field vectors respectively (see Baumjohann and \nTreumann, 1997). However, particles in the atmospheric will also be effected by \ncollisions with other atmospheric particles. The height at which collisions become \nimportant depends on the ratio between the collisional frequency and the gyro-\nfrequency of the particles (the frequency at which the particles gyrate around the \nmagnetic field, see Baumjohann and Trumann, 1997). Since ions have a smaller gyro-\nfrequency than electrons, collisions become important for ions at higher altitudes (less \ndense regions) than for electrons. Collisions start to significantly effect the motion of \nions at altitudes of ~150 km and at ~80 km for electrons. Thus between ~80 and 150 km \nelectrons remain \u2018frozen\u2019 to the magnetic field and continue to move with the BE \u00d7  \ndrift (in the direction of the ionospheric convection pattern, Figure 1.6b) while BE \u00d7  \nmotion of ions is slowed such that below ~125 km protons move mostly in the direction \nof E (shown in Figure 1.6b). The relative motions of the electrons and protons generate \nHall currents, which flow in the opposite direction to the convection pattern, and \nPederson currents (flowing in the direction of the electric field). Hall currents are \nillustrated by dashed lines in Figure 1.9a, and Pederson currents by the solid black lines. \nAs illustrated in Figure 1.9a, Pederson currents diverge on the dawnward side of the \nauroral oval and converge on the duskward side. Field-aligned currents (FACs; or \nBirkeland currents) (e.g. Iijima and Potemra, 1978) form at the boundaries of the \nauroral oval to close the Pederson current system. The average morphology of FACs in \nthe ionosphere is shown in Figure 1.9b. Region 1 FACs exist at the poleward edge of \n 11\n \n \nFigure 1.9a: Morphology of ionospheric currents (from Pr\u00f6lss, 2004).  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.9b: Average morphology of field-aligned currents (from \nIijima and Potemra, 1978). Region 1 currents are located at the \npoleward edge of the auroral oval and are directed into the \nionosphere in the dawnward sector and out of the ionosphere in the \nduskward sector. Region 2 currents are located at the equatorward \nedge of the auroral oval and are oppositely directed to region 1 \ncurrents. \nthe auroral oval and are directed out of the ionosphere in the duskward sector (18-22 \nmagnetic local time) and into the ionosphere in the dawnward sector (02-06 magnetic \nlocal time). Region 2 FACs are located at the equatorward edge of the auroral oval and \nare oppositely directed to the region 1 currents. The average morphology extends round \nto the dayside, however, it has been shown that the location at which the FACs switch \nfrom down-going to up-going, and vice-versa, varies over a large MLT range depending \non the orientation of the IMF BBy component (Weimer, 2001). Region 1 currents are \nclosed on the magnetopause and region 2 currents in the ring current. \n \nPrecipitating particles cause significant ionisation in the auroral oval such that the \nconductivity is much higher than in the polar cap. The Hall currents flowing in the \nauroral oval are thus much stronger than those within the polar cap and are known as \nthe eastward and westward electrojets (Figure 1.9a) or the auroral electrojets. These \ncurrents produce the largest ground magnetic disturbances of all the current systems \n(Baumjohann and Treumann, 1997). \n \n1.3.3 Auroral Generation \n \nSeveral processes are involved in the generation of the aurora. For precipitating protons \nthe main mechanism is via charge exchange. The precipitating protons gain an electron \nvia collisions with atmospheric neutrals, becoming an excited H atom which \nsubsequently decays to its ground state emitting Lyman-alpha radiation (see section \n3.1.2). The energetic H atom can undergo many subsequent collisions, gaining and \nlosing its electron many times. The auroral Lyman-alpha emission (~121.6 nm) can be \ndistinguished from other Lyman-alpha emission as it is Doppler shifted due to the \ndownward motion of the emitting H atoms. \n \nThe electron aurora is produced in a variety of ways by the interaction of the \nprecipitating electrons and atmospheric neutrals. This includes elastic collisions, \ncollisional ionisation (the removal of an electron from an atmospheric particle), \ncollisional dissociation (splitting of a molecule into ions via an electron collision) and \ncollisional excitation (where an incident electron collides with a neutral atom giving it \nenergy which is subsequently released via the emission of a photon) (Pr\u00f6lss, 2004). \n \n 12\n1.3.4 The Dayside Auroral Precipitation \n \nThere are several source regions of the precipitating particles which create the dayside \nauroral emission. In-situ particle precipitation measurements from low-latitude \nspacecraft have been used to characterise the precipitation from these different regions \n(e.g. Newell et al. 1991a), which have been mapped to the ionosphere by Newell and \nMeng (1992) and is illustrated in Figure 1.10a. The most equatorward precipitation \nregion is a region of high-energy (several keV electrons and tens of keV ions) plasma \nthought to originate from the dayside extensions of the BPS and CPS (see above). BPS \nprecipitation differs from CPS precipitation in that fewer high-energy ions and more \nlow-energy electrons are present. The BPS precipitation also tends to have more spatial \nand spectral structure than the CPS (Newell et al., 1991b). Poleward of this is a region \nof precipitation thought to originate from the LLBL. This region is very difficult to \ndistinguish from cusp precipitation (see below), particularly in electrons, but in general \nconsists of a less dense but thermalized ion population. Poleward of the LLBL is the \ncusp precipitation region characterised by very high fluxes of < 1 keV electrons and  \n<10 keV ions. As discussed previously, the cusp and LLBL regions are where the \nshocked solar wind of the magnetosheath can gain direct entry to the magnetosphere, \nand the precipitation from these regions is thus of magnetosheath origin. Further \npoleward is a region of low energy (less than a few eV), low density precipitating ions \nthought to originate from the mantle region. At very high latitudes a region of polar rain \nprecipitation may be present. This consists of a homogeneous population of very low \nenergy (less than a few hundred eV) electrons, travelling on open magnetic field lines \nand thought to originate from the solar corona (Fairfield and Scudder et al., 1985). Polar \nrain is intense poleward of the main dayside auroral oval, gradually declining in \nintensity as it moves towards the nightside (Newell et al., 1996). \n \n1.3.5 Nightside Auroral Precipitation \n \nOn the nightside the auroral precipitation can be classified into two distinct regions, the \ndiffuse auroral precipitation and the discrete auroral precipitation. The average locations \nof the diffuse and discrete aurora are shown in Figure 1.10b. The equatorward part of \nthe auroral oval is made up of diffuse auroral emission. The diffuse auroral emission is \nthought to be the result of the relatively steady precipitation of particles from the CPS \n 13\n  \n Figure 1.10a: Average locations of the dayside auroral oval precipitation regions \n(from Newell and Meng, 1992). Radial lines represent hours of MLT and concentric \ncircles MLAT. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1.10b: Average location of the diffuse, discrete and sub-visual regions \nderived from in-situ measurements of precipitating electrons for high activity \ntimes (from Sotirelis and Newell, 2000). Concentric circles are drawn at 60\u00b0, \n70\u00b0 and 80\u00b0 MLAT in AACGM. \n(Newell et al., 1996). The equatorward edge of the diffuse aurora is thought to map to \nthe inner edge of the plasma sheet or ion isotropy boundary (Mende et al., 2003 and \nreferences therein). The energy range of precipitating particles tends to fairly broad, \nbetween a few hundred eV to a few tens of keV. \n \nWhile the diffuse aurora have a distinct lack of structure, the poleward region of \nnightside precipitation consists of long east-west bands of luminosity with very small \nnorth-south extensions (Kivelson and Russell, 1995). This discrete aurora is thought to \noriginate from particles accelerated down field-aligned currents from the BPS. This \nprecipitation is more energetic than the diffuse aurora, with energies typically in the \nrange 1-10 keV (Newell et al., 1996). At the poleward edge of the BPS precipitation is a \nregion of weak ions and electron precipitation known as the sub-visual drizzle region. \nThis precipitation tends to be more structured than polar rain and is of slightly higher \nenergy. While polar rain is defined as a region of low energy electron precipitation, the \nsub-visual drizzle region also contains a higher flux low energy ion component. The \nintensity of the sub-visual drizzle region decreases poleward of the nightside auroral \noval (Newell et al., 1996). \n \n1.4 Summary \n \nIn this chapter we have introduced the solar wind and IMF and set out the regions of the \nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere and ionosphere. The coupling between these regions has been \nintroduced in terms of the Dungey cycle and the expanding-contracting nature of the \npolar cap. \n \nThe subject of this thesis is the magnetospheric substorm. The substorm process is a \nnatural extension of the coupling processes in the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere \nsystem which has been discussed in this chapter. The substorm is introduced to the \nreader in the following chapter. Firstly, a summary of the observational features of the \nthree distinct phases of the substorm is given, before a more detailed review of the \nsubstorm research most relevant to the work in this thesis is carried out. \n 14\nChapter 2. Review of Relevant Substorm Research \n \nIn the first part of this chapter the subject the magnetospheric substorm is introduced. \nThe three main phases of the substorm are introduced and their observational features \ndiscussed. A brief overview of other substorm-like magnetospheric activity is given as \nwell as a summary of the two main onset models for substorm onset. \n \nIn the second part of this chapter a more detailed review of the previous work most \nrelevant to the work carried out in this thesis is given. Firstly, a review of the methods \nused to identify the location of the open\/closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB) in \nthe ionosphere is given in section 2.3. Studies of the open magnetic flux content of the \nmagnetosphere, solar wind and IMF conditions, auroral and geomagnetic activity and \nauroral boundary motions during the substorm cycle are summarised in section 2.4. \n \n2.1 Introduction to Substorms \n \nBased on observations of auroral arcs from a set of ground-based all-sky cameras, \nAkasofu (1964) was the first to produce a working model of auroral activity during \nsubstorms. In this model he defined two distinct phases of the substorm, the substorm \nexpansion and recovery phases. Using a suite of ground-based magnetometers to show \nhow geomagnetic activity slowly increased prior to the explosive onset of the substorm \nexpansion phase (termed the substorm onset), McPherron (1970) introduced the concept \nof the substorm growth phase. These three main phases of the substorm are summarised \nbelow. \n \n2.1.1 The Growth Phase \n \nFigure 2.1 summarises some of the typical features seen during the growth phase of an \nisolated substorm event. The growth phase is usually defined as a period of 30-60 \nminutes of southward orientated IMF (negative BBz) prior to substorm onset (Lester and \nMurdin, 2001). Under southward IMF reconnection occurs at the dayside sub-solar \npoint opening previously closed terrestrial magnetic field lines to the solar wind (see \nsection 1.2.2 and 1.2.3). The newly opened field lines are then swept back over the \n 15\n \nFigure 2.1: Typical features of the substorm growth phase (from Kivelson and \nRussell, 1995). \npolar cap and into the magnetotail by the solar wind flow, leading to the accumulation \nof open magnetic flux in the tail. As the polar cap size increases the auroral oval moves \nto lower latitudes (see Figure 2.2, panels a-c). Convection of closed tail magnetic field \nlines to the dayside is not fast enough to replenish the flux opened on the dayside, \nleading to the erosion of the dayside magnetopause (Aubry et al., 1970). \n \nThe addition of open magnetic flux to the tail lobes increases the flaring angle of the \nmagnetotail such that the solar wind impinges upon the magnetopause at a less grazing \nangle and thus the total force impinged upon the tail by the solar wind is increased  \n(e.g. Petrinec and Russell, 1996). This increased compressional force and increase in \nlobe magnetic flux, increases the magnetic field pressure within the lobes and hence the \npressure exerted in turn on the plasma sheet. As a consequence, the plasma sheet thins \n(e.g. Asano et al., 2004). As the plasma sheet thins, the inner edge of the plasma sheet \nmoves earthwards and the cross-tail current increases. The increase in tail lobe flux also \ncauses the lobe field to become less dipolar and more \u2018tail-like\u2019. \n \nEnhanced convection of magnetic field lines in the ionosphere causes the enhancement \nof the auroral electrojets (section 1.3.2), observed as a gradual increase in magnetic \nactivity in ground-based magnetometers (see below). The substorm growth phase is \nthought to be a necessary condition of the substorm process in which energy is extracted \nfrom the solar wind by dayside reconnection and stored in the magnetotail. This \nincrease in energy and pressure in the tail cannot continue indefinitely and must be \nreleased. This release of energy is achieved during the substorm expansion phase. \n \n2.1.2 The Expansion Phase and Onset Signatures \n \nIn the first model of the expansion phase (Akasofu, 1964) the substorm onset, and the \nstart of the expansion phase, is defined as the time at which the most equatorward \nauroral arc observed by ground-based all-sky cameras shows a sudden and rapid \nincrease in intensity. The global dynamics of the auroral oval during a substorm event, \nas viewed in the far ultraviolet (FUV), is shown in Figure 2.2 where local noon is to the \ntop of each panel and local midnight to the bottom. During the growth phase, panels a-c, \nthe auroral oval expands as more open magnetic flux is added to the polar cap; a \npseudo-breakup (a short lived substorm-like auroral brightening or failed substorm; see \n 16\n  (a) (d) (g) 12  12  12 \n   \n   06 \n \n \n  18 \n \n \n  18 \n \n \n  18       06      06 \n \n \n    \n   00 \n \n \n    \n    00 \n \n \n    \n 00 \n \n (b) \n \n   12 \n \n(e)\n \n 12 \n \n(h)\n  \n 12 \n \n06\n \n06\n \n06\n \n 18 \n \n 18 \n \n  18 \n \n \n    \n00\n \n \n    \n00\n \n \n    \n00\n (c) (f) (i)  12    12  12 \n \n           06 \n \n      06 \n \n         06 \n \n \n  18 \n \n \n  18 \n \n \n  18 \n \n \n      00 \n \n \n    00 \n \n \n    00 \nFigure 2.2: IMAGE WIC observations of the northern polar cap during an \nisolated substorm on the 10th of January 2001.

During the substorm growth \nphase, panels a-c, the auroral oval gradually moves to lower latitude, signifying \nan increase in the open magnetic flux content of the polar cap. Substorm onset is \nseen at 14:27:31, panel d. During the expansion phase of the substorm the \nnightside auroral brightening expands in all directions and the polar cap shrinks \nsignifying a closure of open magnetic flux. During the recovery phase, panels h-i, \nauroral activity returns to quiet time levels and the polar cap begins to increase in \nsize once more.

The brightening expands in all directions, causing a \ndecrease in polar cap size, panels e-h, indicating a rapid closure of open magnetic flux \n(see also section 1.2.3). \n \nThe rapid auroral brightening is the visible manifestation of the onset of the expansion \nphase. Many phenomenological models have been proposed to explain the observational \nfeatures of the substorm expansion phase. Currently, the two leading models both agree \nthat the expansion phase begins with the onset of large-scale reconnection in the \nmagnetotail at a newly formed near-Earth neutral line (NENL) and disruption of the \nnear-Earth cross-tail current to form the substorm current wedge (SCW; see section \n2.2.2 and Figure 2.3). Both models are discussed in more detail in section 2.2. As the \nexpansion phase progresses, tail reconnection closes large amounts of the previously \nopened magnetic flux, decreasing the size of the polar cap and dipolarising the tail \nmagnetic field (see section 2.2.1 and Figure 2.4). Energetic electrons and protons are \naccelerated down these newly closed magnetic field lines into the ionosphere, where \ntheir interaction with atmospheric neutral atoms causes the bright auroral displays seen \n(see section 1.3.3). Observational results place the initial reconnection site and auroral \nbrightening between 20:00 and 02:00 MLT and 55-75\u00b0 MLAT (e.g. Kamide and \nWinningham, 1977; Craven and Frank 1991; Gerard et al., 2004). \n \nOther signatures of substorm onset include the injection of energetic particles into near-\nEarth orbit and large scale geomagnetic field variations as observed by ground-based \nmagnetometers. These are discussed in more detail below. \n \nThe injection of energetic electrons and protons into geosynchronous orbit is one of the \nmost common signatures of substorm onset and have been shown to be associated with \nalmost all other substorm onset signatures (e.g. Arnoldy and Chan, 1969;  \nBelian et al., 1981; Yeoman et al.,1994; Abel et al., 2006). Enhancements of energetic \nelectrons and protons are observed at the time of substorm onset by particle analyzers \nonboard spacecraft located near geosynchronous orbit (~6.6 RE). Injections above  \n25 keV are particularly dramatic (e.g. Walker et al., 1976; Baker et al., 1978; Belian et \nal., 1978), though injections are also seen at lower energies (e.g. DeForest and \nMcIlwain, 1971; Parks et al., 1980). The injection region is usually found at pre-\n 17\n Figure 2.3: Schematic of the substorm current wedge and substorm auroral \nelectrojet (from McPherron et al., 1973). \nFigure 2.4: Schematic representation of magnetotail reconfiguration during the substorm \ncycle (from Hones, 1984). Magnetic field lines are represented by black lines, plasma flows \nby white arrows, the distant neutral line by N and the NENL by N`. The plasma sheet is \nrepresented by the shaded region. The substorm growth phase is shown in panel 1. Substorm \nexpansion progresses through panels 2-9, with reconnection moving to open magnetic field \nlines between panels 5 and 6. The recovery phase progresses through panels 9-10.\nmidnight MLTs (e.g. Lopez et al., 1990), near the MLT of the initial substorm auroral \nbrightening, and confined by the SCW (e.g. Vagina et al., 1995). An average delay of \n1.8-2.5 minutes has been observed between injection and the initial onset of auroral \nactivity (Liou et al., 2001a). Various models and theories have been proposed to explain \nthe simultaneous enhancement of particles of all energies (e.g. McIlwain, 1974; \nKivelson et al., 1980; Moore et al., 1981; Mauk and Meng, 1983; Birn et al., 1997; \nSergeev et al., 1998; Sarris et al., 2002; Sarris and Li, 2005; Liu et al., 2009) but the \nmechanism is still not well understood. See also section 5.1.3. \n \nAs discussed in section 3.6 of this thesis, the AL and AU indices provide a measure of \nthe strength of the westward and eastward auroral electrojets. Figure 2.5 shows the \ntypical variation of the AL and AU indices through the three phases of an isolated \nsubstorm event. During the growth phase of the substorm enhanced convection leads to \nthe enhancement of both the eastward and westward auroral electrojets and a slow \nincrease in the magnitude of AL and AU is seen (1-2, Figure 2.5). At onset (point 2) the \ncross-tail current is diverted through the SCW (Figure 2.3) and is closed in the \nionosphere by the substorm electrojet. This westward travelling current expands as the \nSCW expands, impinging on the poleward edge of the oppositely directed eastward \nconvection electrojet. The expansion of the substorm electrojet thus acts to increase the \nmagnitude of the AL index and decrease the magnitude of AU during the expansion \nphase of the substorm (points 2-3, Figure 2.5). Eventually a peak is reached in the AL \nindex and the indices begin to return to quiet time levels as the substorm electrojet fades \nduring the recovery phase (point 3 onwards). \n \n2.1.3 The Recovery Phase \n \nThe start of the recovery phase is marked by the halt of the poleward motion of the \nauroral oval and, if dayside reconnection is ongoing, subsequent retreat to lower \nlatitudes (panels h-i, Figure 2.2). The auroral intensity fades during the recovery phase \nand auroral dynamics return to quiet time levels. These ionospheric signatures of the \nrecovery phase are the result of the decline of reconnection in the magnetotail at the \nNENL and the decay of the SCW. \n \n \n 18\n  \n3 \n \n 2 \n \n 1 \nFigure 2.5: Typical features of the substorm process in the AL and AU geomagnetic \nindices (from Kivelson and Russell, 1995). The AL and AU indices provide a \nmeasure of the westward and eastward electrojets respectively. During the substorm \ngrowth phase convection increases causing an enhancement of both eastward and \nwestward currents. At substorm onset, the formation of the SCW and westward \nsubstorm electrojet enhances the westward current, seen as large negative excursion \nin AL, and decreases the eastward current (AU). During recovery phase the substorm \nelectrojet decays and the indices return to background levels. Intensifications may be \ncaused by pseudo-breakups. \n2.1.4 Sawtooth Events \n \nSawtooth events are essentially periodic substorms identified by the quasi-periodic \nenhancement of energetic electron and proton fluxes at near-Earth orbit (Belian et al., \n1995; Henderson, 2004; Henderson et al., 2006). Figure 2.6 shows a typical sawtooth \nperiod in both energetic electrons (panel a) and protons (panel b) as seen by particle \nanalyzers onboard the LANL spacecraft. Periodic dispersionless injections are seen in \nboth electrons and protons within the injection region. The wave-like pattern of proton \ninjections, similar to the teeth on a saw, gives these events their name. A typical event \nconsists of 3-8 individual teeth which occur quasi-periodically approximately every  \n2-4 hours. Typically they occur during geomagnetic storms when the solar wind driving \nis strong and steady (e.g. Pulkkinen et al., 2007). They occur with moderate solar wind \ndensity, velocity and dynamic pressure and with steady and strongly southward IMF \n(e.g. DeJong et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009b). The tail magnetic field variation during \na sawtooth event characteristically shows periodic stretching and relaxation at the \nperiodicity of the teeth (e.g. Pulkkinen et al., 2006). The continued injection of \nenergetic particles into near-Earth orbit leads to the enhancement of the ring current \n(McPherron et al., 2008). Magnetic field variations suggest that substorm activity \nduring sawtooth events occurs over a larger spread in magnetic local time than for \nisolated events (Clauer et al., 2006). \n \n2.1.5 Steady Magnetospheric Convection \n \nAn SMC event is defined as an extended period of time (>90 minutes and as long as  \n10 hours) in which the aurora are active as compared to quiet time levels but with an \nabsence of substorm-like activity (e.g. Pytte et al., 1978; Sergeev 1977). SMC events \noccur during periods of steady solar wind driving, moderate, steady and southward IMF \nconditions, typically slow solar wind speeds (<400 km s-1) and should have a fixed polar \ncap area and steady location of particle precipitation boundaries (e.g. McPherron et al., \n2005, 2008; Sergeev et al., 1996; O\u2019Brian et al., 2002). SMCs have been associated \nwith a double auroral oval configuration in which the nightside auroral oval consists of \ntwo bright regions separated by a dark band (e.g. Elphinstone et al., 1995; Pulkkinen et \nal., 1995). SMC events have very similar characteristics to the recovery phase of \nsubstorms. A time period which displays the above characteristics is therefore defined \n 19\n  \n (b) \nFigure 2.6: Energetic electron (left hand) and proton (right hand) observations from seven of the LANL \nspacecraft are shown for a typical sawtooth period on the 18th of April 2002 (from Henderson et al., 2006). \nVertical yellow and blue lines show the time at which the spacecraft are located at local noon and \nmidnight respectively. \nas an SMC if the period lasts longer than the typical length of the substorm recovery \nphase, approximately 90 minutes. SMC events often occur after the onset of an isolated \nsubstorm event (e.g. McPherron et al., 2005), suggesting that substorms play an \nimportant role in preconditioning the magnetosphere for SMC events. The steady size of \nthe polar cap during SMC events suggests that dayside and nightside reconnection rates \nmust be in balance. For more information on SMCs see McPherron et al. (2008) and \nreferences therein. \n \n2.1.6 Pseudo-Breakup \n \nAkasofu (1964) noted that on occasion an auroral arc would intensify, as if marking the \nstart of substorm onset, but a global expansion of the intensification would not occur \nwith auroral activity fading back to quiet time levels after only a few minutes. These \nevents were termed pseudo-breakups. Pseudo-breakups show many of the signatures of \nsubstorm onset, including an brightening of the most equatorward auroral arc, Pi2 \npulsations (irregular magnetic fluctuations caused by the rapid depolarization of the tail \nmagnetic field, see Olson (1999) and Liou et al. (2000) and references therein), \nenhancement of the westward auroral electrojet, formation of a SCW, field \ndepolarization and energetic particle injection to geosynchronous orbit (see McPherron \net al., 2008 and references therein). It is often hard to distinguish between small \nsubstorms and pseudo-breakups. The defining feature of pseudo-breakup is the lack of \nglobal expansion and very localised nature, weak onset signatures and short duration \n(<10 minutes). Pseudo-breakups are often described as failed substorms in which \nreconnection is initiated in the plasma sheet but either does not progress to the open \nfield lines in the lobes or halts for some other reason (McPherron et al., 2008). An \nexample of a pseudo-breakup, as seen by a global auroral imager, is seen in panel b of \nFigure 2.2. \n \n2.1.7 Poleward Boundary Intensifications \n \nPoleward Boundary Intensifications (PBIs) are transient intensifications of the nightside \nauroral oval which occur near the poleward edge of the auroral oval. PBIs have been \nshown to occur with a periodicity of approximately 10 minutes under all geomagnetic \nconditions (Lyons et al., 1998), but most often occur in the recovery phases of substorm \n 20\nevents (Zesta et al., 2002). The brightening starts at the poleward edge of the auroral \noval and may or may not move equatorward and in local time. Zesta et al. (2002) \nsuggested that PBIs are caused by localised reconnection occurring at a distant neutral \nline. \n \n2.2 Onset Models \n \n2.2.1 The Near-Earth Neutral Line Model \n \nIn the NENL model (McPherron et al., 1973; Baker et al., 1996) the substorm \nexpansion phase is initiated by the spontaneous start of reconnection in the near-Earth \nplasma sheet. Figure 2.4 shows a detailed schematic of the evolution of the magnetotail \nduring the substorm process as described by the NENL model (Hones, 1984). During \nthe growth phase of the substorm (panel 1) more open magnetic flux is added to the \nmagnetotail through reconnection at the dayside magnetopause than is closed at the \ndistant neutral line in the tail, leading to the accumulation of open magnetic flux in the \ntail. This leads to an increase in pressure in the magnetospheric lobes which must be \nbalanced by the plasma sheet and hence results in a thinning of the plasma sheet. The \nplasma sheet cannot thin indefinitely and once the increase in plasma sheet pressure can \nno longer be sustained reconnection is initiated at a new NENL within the closed \nmagnetic field line region of the plasma sheet (panel 2). As reconnection continues to \neat through the closed magnetic field lines of the plasma sheet, panels 3-4, plasma is fed \ninto the NENL in the vertical direction and ejected on newly formed closed magnetic \nflux loops both earthward and tailward. Earthward moving field lines having both \nfootprints connected to the surface of the Earth and tailward moving field lines having \nboth footprints connected to the solar corona. Once reconnection reaches the last plasma \nsheet field line, panel 5, the closed loops of plasma tailward of the neutral line are \npinched off from the earthward plasma sheet, forming a plasmoid of hot energetic \nplasma wrapped in the open magnetic flux of the tail lobes (panel 6). The plasmoid is \nsubsequently dragged downtail by the magnetic tension of the field lines (see section \n1.2.2), panels 6-8, leaving a thin plasma sheet in its wake, panel 9. Meanwhile, \nreconnection at the NENL continues onto the open magnetic field lines of the lobes, \ncreating new closed magnetic flux tubes which will eventually convect back round to \n 21\nthe dayside completing the Dungey cycle (panels 6-9). During the recovery phase of the \nsubstorm the NENL retreats to its distant location and the reconnection rate decreases. \n \nIn the NENL model, both the injection of energetic particles into near-Earth orbit and \nthe disruption of the cross-tail current and formation of the SCW are caused by the \nformation of the NENL. Observations made by spacecraft in the magnetotail of the \nearthward and tailward plasma flows resulting from the NENL place the initial location \nof the NENL between 20-30 RE (e.g. Nagai et al., 1998). Other papers suggest that the \nlocation is closer to 18 RE (e.g. Slavin et al., 2005). \n \n2.2.2 The Current Disruption Model \n \nIn the current disruption model of substorm onset, current disruption is not a \nconsequence of the formation of the NENL, but rather the cause. In the current \ndisruption onset model (Chao et al., 1977; Lui, 1991, 1996) the growth phase develops \nas described in section 2.2.1, thinning the plasma sheet and resulting in an increase in \nthe cross-tail current. Eventually the plasma sheet reaches a thickness comparable to the \ngyroradius of ions, causing ions to become demagnetised from the magnetic field and \nnon-adiabatic in nature. The interaction between the ions and adiabatic electrons \nflowing in the opposite direction cause plasma instabilities in the near-Earth plasma \nsheet at approximately 10 RE. These instabilities prevent the cross-tail current from \nflowing, forcing its redirection down new field-aligned currents forming the SCW \n(Figure 2.3). These field aligned-currents are closed by a westward travelling current in \nthe ionosphere called the substorm electrojet. In the current disruption model particle \ninjection and depolarization of the near-Earth magnetic field is thought to be due to \nthese instabilities rather than reconnection at the NENL, as postulated in the NENL \nmodel. The current disruption process and instabilities produce a rarefaction wave \nwhich propagates downtail, causing the plasma sheet to thin behind it, eventually \ninitiating reconnection and the formation of the NENL further downtail. \n \n \n \n \n \n 22\n2.2.3 A Critical Threshold for Substorm Onset and Solar Wind Triggering \n \nAlthough the tail instabilities described in the NENL and current disruption models are \nable to explain the observational features of the substorm expansion phase, what \ntriggers these instabilities is still a matter of much debate. While most models agree that \nthe growth phase of the substorm is required to precondition the magnetosphere such \nthat onset can occur, scientists hold differing views as to whether an internal threshold \nto the magnetosphere (e.g. in open magnetic flux) is a sufficient condition to initiate \nsubstorm onset or whether a solar wind trigger is also required. Arguments for both \ncases are given below. \n \nKamide et al. (1977) studied the dependence of substorm occurrence frequency on the \nlatitude of the equatorward boundary of the nightside auroral oval, which is at best \nindirectly related to the open magnetic flux (e.g. Coumans et al., 2007). They showed \nthere to be a maximum oval latitude above which substorm onset never occurs and \ncorresponding minimum latitude above which the cumulative probability of onset is \n100%, implying a minimum and maximum critical threshold in open magnetic flux for \nsubstorm onset. \n \nRecent statistical studies have lent support for the view that a critical threshold in open \nmagnetic flux as a necessary condition for substorm onset. Freeman and Morley (2004) \nshowed that the average occurrence frequency of substorm onset could be replicated \nusing a simple integrate-and-fire model of onset, assuming onset occurs once some \ncritical threshold has been reached in the magnetosphere. Nakai and Kamide (2004) \nestimated the total pressure in the magnetotail lobes, showing that substorm onsets \noccur above the upper quartile of the pressure distribution. Shukhtina et al. (2005) \nshowed that the magnetic flux stored in the tail lobes at onset was on average ~1 GWb, \nexceeding the typical values during quiet times and SMCs by 50%. Milan et al. (2007) \nquantified the hemispheric open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere from a \ntotal period of 72 hours of observations of the northern polar cap.  They found that the \nopen magnetic flux varied between 0.3 and 0.9 GWb, with the occurrence of nightside \nreconnection events rapidly increasing above ~0.5 GWb, suggesting that above 0.5 \nGWb some critical threshold has been exceeded. A more extensive review of the open \n 23\nmagnetic flux content of the magnetosphere through the substorm process is provided in \nsection 2.4. \n \nThese studies have suggested that a critical threshold in open magnetic flux exists as a \nnecessary condition for substorm onset. However, they also show that substorm onsets \ncan occur over a wide range of open flux values, suggesting that any critical threshold is \nvariable. Nakai and Kamide (2004) found that the magnetotail pressure was correlated \nwith the Dst index, and Shukhtina et al. (2005) showed that the total magnetic flux in \nthe tail at onset was strongly correlated with the dayside reconnection electric field \naveraged over the one hour prior to onset. These results suggest that any critical \nthreshold is dependent on the dayside reconnection rate or level of solar wind driving, \n(which in turn determines the Dst index (Burton et al., 1975)). Other studies have \nreported the positive correlation between open magnetic flux at onset and the level of \nsolar wind driving, whilst Milan et al. (2008, 2009a,b) have shown that the level of \nopen magnetic flux in the magnetosphere remains elevated when the ring current is \nenhanced, suggested that the ring current stabilises the magnetosphere to tail \nreconnection, causing the threshold in open magnetic flux to increase. \n \nWhile the studies above suggest that a critical threshold which is internal to the \nmagnetosphere must be exceeded for substorm onset, other studies have suggested that \na trigger in the solar wind is required. For example, the association between \ninterplanetary shocks or solar wind dynamic pressure changes and substorm events has \nlong been studied (e.g. Kawasaki et al., 1971; Burch, 1972; Zhou and Tsunitani, 2001). \nHowever, recent statistical studies have shown that only a small percentage (~ 2%) of \nsubstorms are associated with solar wind shocks or pressure changes (McPherron et al., \n1986). Other studies have found a much larger correlation between a northward turning \nof the BBz component of the IMF and substorm onset, some studies requiring a period \n(~30 minutes) of southward IMF (growth phase) prior to substorm onset in addition to a \nnorthward turning to classify a substorm as triggered. Caan et al. (1975) showed that the \nonset of mid-latitude positive bays could be associated with northward turnings. \nHirshberg and Holzer (1975) noted that in a superposed epoch analysis carried out by \nFoster et al. (1971) the BzB  component of the IMF reached a minimum at the onset time \nof substorms, suggesting triggering. Caan et al. (1977) subsequently found that 60% of \na study of 18 substorms identified by auroral zone magnetometers could be associated \n 24\nwith a northward turning of IMF BBz. Rostoker (1983), Sergeev et al. (1986) and Samson \nand Yeung (1986) also suggested an association between northward turnings and \nsubstorm onset. McPherron et al. (1986) studied a six-month interval finding that \napproximately 44% of all substorms occurring in this period could be associated with a \nnorthward turning. Troshichev et al. (1986) suggested that the IMF ByB  component could \nalso trigger onset events (see also Bae et al., 2001). Lyons et al. (1995) suggested that \nmost if not all substorms are triggered by changes in the solar wind and that previous \nstudies had either missed solar wind triggers due to the resolution of solar wind data or \nthe location of the IMF monitor, or that non-triggered substorms were not really \nsubstorms. However, Henderson et al. (1996) then showed that, although 3 events \nwhich had previously been classified as non-triggered events could be associated with a \nsolar wind trigger if better resolution data were used, 6 events clearly occurred during \nvery quiet solar wind conditions. Hsu and McPherron (2003) went on to show that the \nlocation of the solar wind monitor does not significantly effect the statistics of triggered \nand non-triggered events seen and Hsu and McPherron (2009) used high resolution \nsolar wind data to show that small-scale structures in the solar wind cannot account for \nthe 40% of non-triggered events found in the statistical study of Hsu and McPherron \n(2003). \n \nLyons et al. (1997) studied 20 substorm events finding that 14 could be associated with \neither a northward turning or BBy trigger. They also estimated that the probability of a \nchance association between triggers and substorms to be less than 10 . Hsu and \nMcPherron (2002) studied 145 substorms events and showed that the observed \nassociation with northward turning could not be reproduced by a chance association. \nHsu and McPherron (2003) found, from a study of some 200 onset events, a ratio of \napproximately 60:40 between triggered and non-triggered events. They also found that \nthe addition of IMF By\n-9\nB  triggers to the study did not increase this ratio significantly.  \nLiou (2007) have also suggested that a decrease in solar wind dynamic pressure can be \nassociated with substorm onset. \n \nTaking a different tack, Lee et al. (2007) considered why some changes in the solar \nwind which have been shown to be associated with substorm onset do not always \ntrigger onset. They argue that a solar wind trigger will not trigger onset if either: (1) the \nmagnetosphere has not been sufficiently preconditioned by a significant growth phase, \n 25\n(2) the solar wind trigger is inherently not a substorm trigger or (3) there is a nullifying \neffect in which two solar wind changes can cancel each other out. Lyons et al. (1995) \nsuggested that any change in the solar wind which causes a decrease in the convection \nstrength in the inner plasma sheet will initiate onset. Lee et al. (2007) suggested that the \nsolar wind changes not associated with onset in their study are consistent with this idea. \nNon-triggering changes either acting to increase the convection, or two changes \noccurring simultaneously, one acting to increase convection, the other to decrease \nconvection, thus cancelling each other out. Russell (2000) suggested a different \nmechanism by which northward turnings of the IMF could trigger substorm onset. In his \nmodel, reconnection on open magnetic field lines at a distant neutral line feeds \nreconnection on closed magnetic field lines at a NENL. At a northward turning of the \nIMF reconnection halts at the distant neutral line and stops feeding the NENL with \nclosed flux. Reconnection at the NENL thus moves onto low density open magnetic \nfield lines, where reconnection can occur much faster. When reconnection moves to \nopen magnetic field lines the substorm expansion phase begins. \n \nThe studies discussed above clearly show an association between solar wind changes \nand substorms onset, but whether solar wind triggers are a real substorm phenomena is \nstill a matter of debate. A recent study by Wild et al. (2009) found that, while less than \n25% of a study 260 substorm events could be associated with a northward turning \ntrigger (which are only considered as a trigger if preceded by a period of southward \nIMF, a substorm growth phase criterion), most events could be associated with the \ngrowth phase criterion used in the definition of a northward turning. Most authors now \nagree that a substorm growth phase, a common criterion for both triggered and non-\ntriggered events, is a necessary condition of substorms onset. Many examples of \nsubstorms occurring independently of any changes in the solar wind suggest that an \nentirely internal instability (such as in open magnetic flux) is a sufficient condition for \nonset and that no solar wind trigger is required (see also Morley et al., 2007). \n \n \n \n \n \n 26\n2.3 Identifying the Location of the Open\/Closed Magnetic Field Line Boundary in \nthe Ionosphere \n \nAs mentioned above, many studies have suggested that a critical threshold in the open \nmagnetic flux content of the magnetosphere exists as a necessary condition for substorm \nonset. One of the main aims of this thesis is to investigate this claim by carrying out a \nlarge statistical study of the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere at the \ntime of substorm onset. \n \nSeveral studies developed empirical relations between the flaring angle of the \nmagnetosphere, tail radius and tail magnetic field strength to estimate the amount of \nopen magnetic flux in the tail lobes at substorm onset (e.g. Petrinec and Russell, 1996; \nShukhtina et al., 2004; Shukhtina et al., 2005). However, these studies use observations \nfrom a single spacecraft in the magnetotail and do not distinguish between flux of open \nor closed origin. Currently, the most accurate method for estimating the open magnetic \nflux content of any one hemisphere is by observing the location of the open\/closed \nmagnetic field line boundary (OCB) at all magnetic local times (MLTs) and hence \ndetermining the area of the polar cap (the area of the ionosphere threaded by open \nmagnetic field lines). Several ionospheric measurements and techniques have been \ndeveloped to provide a proxy for the location of the OCB, and these are summarised \nbelow. \n \n2.3.1 Particle Precipitation Measurements \n \nIn-situ particle precipitation measurements from low-latitude spacecraft (such as the \nDMSP spacecraft; see section 3.2) provide the most direct and precise determination of \nthe boundaries between different plasma regimes, including the OCB. By identifying \ndifferent regions of precipitation from electron and ion spectra one can determine where \nthe precipitation transitions from precipitation on closed magnetic field lines to open. \nOn the dayside the best proxy for the OCB is found by searching for the transition \nbetween BPS, CPS and LLBL precipitation (closed) to lower energy cusp, mantle and \npolar rain precipitation (open) (Newell et al. 1991a). On the nightside the best proxy for \nthe OCB is at the poleward edge of the sub-visual drizzle region (Newell et al., 1996). \nThese particle precipitation boundaries (PPBs) are thought to be the best proxy for the \n 27\nOCB but, due to the polar nature of low-altitude spacecraft orbits, can only be \ndetermined at two magnetic local times in any one orbit (~100 minutes for the DMSP \nspacecraft). \n \n2.3.2 All-sky Cameras, Meridian Scanning Photometers, Coherent and Incoherent \nScatter Radar and Ground-based Magnetometers \n \nSamson et al. (1992) suggested that the location of the OCB may be determined from \nmeasurements of the 630 nm auroral emission as a function of latitude.  \nBlanchard et al. (1995) demonstrated that a sharp step in the 630 nm emission is seen at \nthe poleward edge of the auroral oval and that this transition between intense and weak \nemission may be tracked over a relatively large latitudinal range and with high time \nresolution using a chain of meridian scanning photometers (MSP). By quantitatively \nlocating the emission boundary they compared the poleward edge of the 630 nm aurora \nwith the latitude of the OCB as determined from DMSP PPBs for a total of 10 events. \nThree of these events occurred during the expansion phase of substorms and showed \nlarge differences between the two boundaries of up to 5\u00b0. For a further three events the \npoleward edge of the aurora was located outside of the latitudinal range covered by the \nphotometers. For the remaining four events the DMSP and MSP boundaries coincided \nwith an rms error of \u00b10.9\u00b0 in latitude. Blanchard et al. (1997) expanded on this study \nusing a much larger data set and found that the two boundaries coincided with an \naccuracy of \u00b10.54\u00b0. \n \nUntil the 1970s the principal information on the structure and dynamics of the auroral \noval was inferred from analysis of millions of all-sky camera films (e.g. Feldstein and \nGalperin, 1985; Sandholt et al., 1998). All-sky cameras use a special fisheye lens to \nview the entire sky from horizon to horizon (180\u00b0) and can be used to view the optical \nauroral emission. Bond and Akasofu (1979) showed that the poleward edge of the \noptical emission as viewed by all-sky cameras was in excellent agreement with the \nlocation of the poleward edge of emission as seen by satellite imagery. \n \nMeasurements of the Doppler spectral width of ionospheric backscatter, measured by \ncoherent scatter radar such as the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), \nmay be employed to produce an accurate proxy for the OCB. Baker et al. (1995) \n 28\nshowed that enhanced spectral widths were associated with cusp precipitation on open \nmagnetic field lines and that equatorward of this the spectral width was reduced. This \nimplies that the transition between high spectral widths, typically found poleward of the \nOCB, and low spectral widths, typically found within the auroral oval, may be a good \nproxy for the position of the OCB. This boundary has been termed the Spectral Width \nBoundary (SWB). Several studies suggested that the SWB and other radar backscatter \nproperties could be used as proxies for the OCB but that the relationship between the \ntwo is not straightforward (e.g. Milan et al., 1999; Blanchard et al., 2001;  \nChisham et al., 2001, 2002; Lester et al., 2001). Chisham and Freeman (2004) showed \nthat the SWB is a typical feature at all MLTs. However, Chisham and Freeman (2003) \ndemonstrated that accurately identifying this transition can be difficult due to the broad \ndistributions and significant overlap in the regions of high and low spectral width. \nChisham and Freeman (2004) developed a threshold method (see also Baker et al., \n1997) in which they search poleward along a radar beam until a threshold value in \nspectral width is exceeded. Using this technique, Chisham et al. (2004, 2005a,b) \ncompared the latitude of the SWB from 5 years of SuperDARN data with the OCB as \nestimated using DMSP PPBs. They found that at most MLTs the SWB gave a good \nproxy for the OCB except in the 0200-0800 MLT sector, similar to the offsets found \nbetween Polar UVI and DMSP OCB proxies by Carbary et al. (2003), discussed below. \n \nIncoherent scatter radar may also used to measure the transition between high density \nionospheric electrons found in the auroral oval and low densities poleward of the OCB \n(e.g. Blanchard et al. 2001). See also Chisham et al. (2008, 2009). \n \nThe polar cap boundary can also be identified with the high-latitude boundary of region \n1 field-aligned currents, which can be measured using ground based magnetometers \n(Iijima and Potemra, 1978; Mishin, 1990). \n \n2.3.3 Satellite Images \n \nAll of the above methods suffer from limited spatial and temporal coverage of the OCB. \nCurrently, the best method of determining the global location of the OCB is from global \nauroral images taken by satellites. However, many studies have shown that the \n 29\npoleward edge of the auroral emission as determined from imaging spacecraft does not \nhave a simple relationship with the location of the OCB. \n \nThe first efforts to find the poleward edge of the auroral oval from satellite images were \nmade by inspecting auroral images taken by simple scanning photometers onboard polar \norbiting low-latitude spacecraft (e.g. Lui and Anger, 1973; Lui et al., 1975; Holzworth \nand Meng, 1975). However, this scanning variety of auroral imager has the drawback \nthat different points within the image are acquired at different times as the photometer \nscans across the polar cap. The introduction of ultraviolet (UV) imaging cameras, which \ntake a snapshot of the whole auroral oval such that the whole auroral oval is imaged \nsimultaneously, solved this problem. FUV imagers (120-190 nm) are also able to \ndistinguish between high latitude dayglow and auroral oval emission as well as being \nonly minimally contaminated by daylight scattered by clouds and the ground  \n(Mende et al., 2000a). \n \nThe first quantitative identification of the poleward edge of the auroral oval from global \nauroral images was made using observations from the Dynamics Explorer 1 spacecraft \n(Craven and Frank, 1985, 1987; Frank and Craven, 1988). A technique was employed to \ndetermine the edge of the auroral emission such that the poleward edge of the auroral \noval is assumed to be located where the auroral intensity drops below some threshold \nvalue. Brittnacher et al. (1999) used a similar threshold method to determine the global \nlocation of the OCB from global auroral observations made by the Polar Ultraviolet \nImager (UVI) (Torr et al., 1995). Kauristie et al. (1999) used 44 UV images, taken by \nthe Viking spacecraft, of the northern nightside auroral oval and a threshold method to \ndetermine the poleward edge of the UV auroral oval. Comparing a small number of \nthese boundaries with DMSP PPB OCB estimates, they found that the poleward edge of \nUV emission is often found more than 2\u00b0 equatorward of the location of the equivalent \nparticle boundary, especially in the midnight and morning sector. Baker et al. (2000) \ncompared the poleward boundary of the UV aurora as seen by Polar UVI using both a \nthreshold method and ratio method (where the poleward edge of auroral emission is \nassumed to be located where the auroral intensity drops by a fixed ratio from its peak \nvalue at the local time of the boundary). They found that the ratio method had the best \ncorrelation with DMSP PPBs and also revealed a systematic latitudinal offset between \nthe UVI and DMSP boundaries of ~ 1\u00b0 in the evening sector (where most of the \n 30\nobservations were made). Carbary et al. (2003) developed a new method of estimating \nthe location of the OCB using Polar UVI auroral images. They fit a Gaussian-like \nfunction plus quadratic background term to intensity-latitude profiles across one hour \nMLT sectors of the UVI auroral oval. The location of the OCB was then assumed to be \nshifted poleward of the center of the Gaussian function by the full-width-at-half-\nmaximum (FWHM). Comparing over 23,000 UVI and DMSP PPB OCB estimates, they \nfound that the statistical distributions of offsets in each 1-hour MLT bin were Gaussian \nin nature with a mean close to zero and Gaussian full-width of ~ 3-4 degrees. The mean \noffsets derived from these distributions show systematic trends in MLT, with the largest \noffset occurring in the predawn sector ionosphere, where the DMSP OCB is found \n~3.5\u00b0 more poleward of the equivalent UVI boundary. A second order harmonic \nexpansion was fit to the mean offsets in order to provide a \u2018calibration\u2019 or \u2018correction\u2019 \nto Polar UVI boundaries to provide a more accurate proxy for the OCB. Other studies \nhave suggested that a double Gaussian fit to intensity-latitude profiles provides a better \nfit to the OCB (e.g. Mende et al., 2003; Gjerloev et al., 2008). \n \n2.4 Summary of Previous Studies on the Polar Cap Flux, Solar Wind and IMF \nconditions, Geomagnetic Activity and Motion of Auroral Boundaries during the \nSubstorm Cycle \n \nIn this thesis we investigate the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere, the \nsolar wind and IMF conditions, the auroral and geomagnetic activity, as well as motions \nof the OCB and equatorward boundary of the auroral oval during the substorm cycle.  \nA detailed summary of the previous studies most relevant to the work in this thesis is \ngiven below. \n \n2.4.1 Variations in Open Magnetic Flux \n \nBy carrying out the largest statistical study of the open magnetic flux content of the \nmagnetosphere to date, in chapter 5 of this thesis we investigate the idea of a critical \nthreshold in open magnetic flux as a necessary condition for substorm onset.  \nAs discussed above, currently, the most accurate method of estimating the hemispheric \nopen magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere is by identifying the global location of \nthe open\/closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB) and hence determining the area of \n 31\nthe polar cap. As discussed in section 2.3, several methods have been developed for \ndetermining the latitude of the OCB. Once the OCB has been identified, the open \nmagnetic flux can then be easily estimated by integrating the Earth\u2019s magnetic field (B) \nthrough the area of the polar cap: \n \n\u222b=\npc\npc dsBF . .           (2.1) \n \nSeveral studies have investigated the size of the polar cap and Fpc during substorms for \na limited number of events. These are summarised below. \n \nMilan et al. (2003) used a combination of auroral images, radar observations and \nparticle precipitation boundaries to identify the global OCB in the northern hemisphere \nand hence track changes in the polar cap area over two substorm cycles. They found \nthat the polar cap area expanded during the growth phase of both events before \ndecreasing in size immediately (within 10 minutes) after                               substorm \nonset. The contraction of the polar cap area continued for up to 100 minutes after onset, \nsome time after auroral activity had faded. Milan et al. (2004) used the method of Milan \net al. (2003) to track the global OCB and estimate Fpc in the northern hemisphere, using \nequation 2.1, for an almost continuous 8 hour period. They estimated that between  \n2.5-12% (0.2-1.0 GWb) of the total magnetic flux in any one hemisphere (~8 GWb) is \nconnected to the solar wind (i.e. is open) at any one time, with an average value of  \n8% (0.64 GWb). The extreme value of 0.2 GWb was found after a solar wind pressure \nstep which initiated a large substorm event and was followed by three hours of \ncontinuous northward IMF (i.e. little addition of open flux at the dayside magnetopause \noccurred). Milan et al. (2007) used a similar technique to quantify Fpc for a total period \nof 73 hours containing 25 tail reconnection events. They found that Fpc varied between \n0.2 and 0.9 GWb with a mean value of 0.46 GWb, indicating that between 2.5 and 11% \nof hemispheric flux is open. The average Fpc at the onset of reconnection events was \n0.65 GWb and the average Fpc at the end of the expansion phase was 0.45 GWb. The \namount of Fpc closed in each event varied between 0.05 and 0.75 GWb with a mean \nvalue of 0.3 GWb (the discrepancy between the average Fpc at the start and end of the \nreconnection events and this value being due to the continued addition of Fpc by dayside \nreconnection in the expansion phases). Milan et al. (2008) quantified Fpc from auroral \n 32\nimages of the northern hemisphere taken by the FUV Wideband Imaging Camera \n(WIC) (Mende et al., 2000b) onboard the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global \nExploration (IMAGE) spacecraft (Burch, 2000) for a near-continuous period of 10 days \ncovering August and September 2005. The distribution of Fpc varied between ~ 0.2 and \n1 GWb with a mean value of 0.43 GWb. \n \nFrey et al. (2004) produced a list of substorm onsets by identifying nightside auroral \nbrightenings and expansion in auroral images made by the IMAGE WIC FUV detector \nfor the entire lifetime of the IMAGE mission (March 2000 to December 2005) using the \nfollowing criteria: \n(1) a clear local brightening of the auroral oval must be observed, \n(2) the local brightening must expand to the poleward boundary of the auroral oval and \nspread azimuthally in local time for at least 20 minutes, \n(3) a substorm onset was only accepted as a separate substorm if at least 30 minutes had \npassed since the previous onset. \n \nThe third criterion eliminated closely spaced onsets or multi-onsets and the second \ncriterion was employed to try to eliminate pseudo-breakups which did not develop into \na full substorm event. The center of the initial auroral intensification was identified by \neye and a computer program used to locate the brightest pixel near this location, \ndefining the latitude and MLT of the initial auroral brightening. \n \nUsing the Frey et al list of onsets Coumans et al. (2006) used auroral images from the \nIMAGE FUV spectrographic imager SI12 (Mende et al., 2000c) and a threshold method \nto indentify the global OCB to carry out a superposed epoch analysis of the evolution of \nFpc for 55 substorm events from the time period June 2000 to December 2002. They \nchose only very isolated events (separated by at least two hours from the previous \nsubstorm) and events which showed a significant equatorward motion of auroral \nboundaries during the substorm growth phase. Of the 55 events, 9 were found to be \nassociated with a northward turning of IMF BBz, 13 were associated with other triggers in \nthe solar wind, and 33 events were non-triggered. The growth phases of all events in the \nstudy were found to be very similar. Fpc was found to increase from values of  \n~ 0.5-0.6 GWb at the start of the growth phase to values of 0.66 and 0.74 GWb at onset \nfor IMF BzB  triggered events and non-triggered events respectively, an average increase \n 33\nof 33% during the 60 minutes prior to onset. DeJong et al. (2007) carried out a \nsuperposed epoch analysis of the evolution of Fpc for 29 individual sawtooth events, 31 \nisolated substorms, and 45 steady magnetospheric convection events. They showed that, \nas expected, Fpc during SMC events remains approximately constant with an average \nFpc of 0.55 GWb. The growth and expansion phases of isolated and sawtooth events \nshowed very similar trends, though the variations in Fpc for sawtooth events were found \nto occur, on average, at values 150% greater in magnitude than for isolated events, \nsuggesting that sawtooth events are more likely to occur when Fpc is enhanced. Fpc \nvaried between ~ 0.5 and 0.7 GWb for isolated events and ~ 0.8 and 1.0 GWb for \nsawteeth. Both types of event were found to close ~ 24% of the onset Fpc over the  \n60 minutes following onset. Huang et al. (2009b) carried out a superposed analysis of \nFpc using auroral images from the IMAGE and Polar spacecraft for a total of 50 \nindividual sawtooth events, 30 isolated substorms and 45 SMC events. Their results \nshowed that Fpc varied between ~ 0.3 and 0.8 GWb, that isolated onsets occurred at a \nmean Fpc of 0.68 GWb and that sawtooth events occur at a mean Fpc of 1.0 GWb.  \nIn both isolated and sawtooth events ~ 24-27% of onset Fpc was closed during the \nexpansion phase. The result that sawtooth events occur at higher values of Fpc is perhaps \nnot unexpected. Sawtooth events tend to occur during period of strong solar wind \ndriving (strongly southward IMF, see section 2.1.4), suggesting that they also occur \nwhen the ring current is enhanced. Milan et al. (2009a,b) have suggested that the ring \ncurrent modulates the magnetotail such that substorms occur at higher values of Fpc \nwhen the ring current is enhanced (see below), thus explained the observations of \nDeJong et al. (2007) and Huang et al. (2009b). The strong and steady solar wind driving \nfor sawtooth events also suggests that, although both sawtooth and isolated events close \nsimilar amount of Fpc during their expansion phases, during sawtooth periods Fpc will \nrise more quickly back to the values at which substorms occur, leading to the periodic \nnature of these events. \n \n2.4.2 Variations in the Solar Wind, IMF, Auroral Intensity and Geomagnetic Activity \nDuring Substorms and Correlation with Fpc. \n \nIn chapter 5 of this thesis we find that not all substorms show the expected particle \ninjection signature of substorm onset, and we classify substorms into three distinct \ncategories based on their particle injection signatures. In chapter 6 we investigate these \n 34\ncategories in more detail by carrying out the largest superposed epoch analysis to date \nof the open magnetic flux, the solar wind and IMF conditions, and the geomagnetic \nactivity and auroral luminosity during the substorm cycle for our three distinct \ncategories of substorm. \n \nPrevious studies have shown that substorms can occur with a large range of solar wind \nand IMF conditions. Substorms tend to occur after a prolonged period of southward \nIMF, the substorm growth phase, although they have also been shown to occur during \nstrongly northward IMF (e.g. Kamide et al., 1977a). An anti-correlation between the \nmagnitude of the IMF BBz component and Fpc at onset has been observed. Other studies \nhave shown a positive correlation of Fpc or polar cap area with auroral activity  \n(e.g. Feldstein and Starkov, 1967) and geomagnetic activity (e.g. Hardy et al., 1985, \n1987). The most relevant studies to the work carried out in this thesis are discussed \nbelow. \n \nZhou and Tsurutani (2001) carried out a statistical study in which substorms, pseudo-\nbreakups and quiescent intervals occurring after interplanetary shocks were associated \nwith strongly southward IMF, near zero IMF and strongly northward IMF respectively. \nKullen and Karlson (2004) studied 3 months of data containing 419 substorm events \nand 330 pseudo-breakups. They found that large substorms most often occur when the \nIMF is strongly negative, small substorms most often occur when BBz is weakly positive \nor zero, and pseudo-breakups most often occur for weakly positive BzB  and very weak \n(below average) IMF magnitudes and solar wind density and flow speeds. They also \nfound that substorms occurring with continuous southward IMF in the expansion phase \nshowed no decrease in polar cap size after onset. \n \nFigure 2.7 shows an example of Fpc, the maximum nightside auroral intensity, the AL \nand AU geomagnetic indices, and the IMF BBz variation around four tail reconnection \nevents from Milan et al. (2007), and illustrates how tail reconnection events can differ \nin size and characteristics. The first reconnection event (1) occurs at a southward \nturning of the IMF (panel d). Both the AL (panel c) and auroral brightness (panel b) \nshow only minimal signatures of onset and Fpc (panel a) shows only a slight decline, \nsuggesting that the continued addition of flux on the dayside during southward IMF is \nbalancing the flux closure in the tail to a large extent. The second event (2) shows much \n 35\n   10 12    14    16 \nUT \nFigure 2.7: Open magnetic flux (thick grey line, panel a) estimated by \nintegrating the radial component of the Earths magnetic field through the area \nenclosed by the OCB identified using global auroral imagery (see Milan et \nal., 2003), maximum nightside auroral intensity (b), geomagnetic indices (c) \nand IMF BZ lagged to the magnetopause (d) during 4 tail reconnection events \n(vertical dashed lines) on the 5th of June 1998, from Milan et al. (2007). The \ndashed and bold black lines represent Fpc modelled from the dayside \nreconnection rate only (i.e. Fpc variation if there was no nightside \nreconnection; dashed line) and Fpc modelled from measurements of the day \nand nightside reconnection rates (bold line; see Milan et al., 2007). \nlarger signatures of onset. A rapid and large brightening of auroral emission is seen \n(panel b) accompanied by large and typical AL and AU signatures of substorm onset. \nThe event appears to be associated with a northward turning of the IMF (panel d).  \nFpc (panel a) is seen to rapidly decrease after the onset. This decrease is temporally \nhalted when the IMF turns southward for a few minutes at ~ 12 UT. Fpc then continues \nto decrease while the IMF is strongly northward (i.e. no dayside reconnection) before \nstarting to increase again at ~ 14 UT in association with a new southward turning and \nstart of the growth phase of event 3. At the onset of event 3 both the magnitude of the \nAL and AU indices and the auroral luminosity are increasing. The IMF remains steadily \nsouthward but the rate of increase of Fpc is slowed indicating that tail reconnection is \nacting to close magnetic flux, slowing the increase in polar cap size. At the onset of \nevent 4 there is a rapid brightening in auroral emission and clear AL and AU signatures \nof a substorm event. The IMF remains southward for approximately half an hour \nfollowing the onset in which time the rise in Fpc is halted but a large decrease is not \nseen. This indicates that even during a large substorm event (as suggested by AL and \nAU indices and auroral emission, event 4) when the IMF remains steadily southward \n(indicating that magnetosphere dynamics continue to be largely \u2018driven\u2019 by the solar \nwind) the level of Fpc can remain elevated (event 4) or even continue to increase if the \ndayside reconnection rate is greater than that on the nightside (event 3; see equation \n1.1). \n \nMilan et al. (2008) studied Fpc and the solar wind and IMF conditions for 49 substorm \nevents from late summer 2005. The main findings of their study can be summarised as \nfollows: (1) The substorm frequency and amount of Fpc closed for substorms both \nincrease for increased solar wind driving. (2) Despite the fact that the amount of Fpc \nclosed during a substorm expansion phase increases for increased solar wind driving, \nthe size of the polar cap is increased for all stages of the substorm cycle when the solar \nwind driving is enhanced and especially when the intensity of the ring current  \n(as measured by the SYM-H index) is elevated. The authors suggest that there are two \nfactors contributing to this result. Firstly, that there is a delay between the onset \n(thought to start in the closed magnetic field line region of the plasma sheet) and \nreconnection on open magnetic field lines in which time open magnetic flux continues \nto be added to the polar cap. The amount of open flux added in this time will be greater \nwhen the solar wind driving is enhanced and hence onset occurs at higher values of Fpc \n 36\nfor stronger solar wind driving. The second interpretation of this result is that the \nmagnetotail is more stable to reconnection when the dayside driving is strong and the \nring current is enhanced. \n \nThe second interpretation was reiterated by Milan et al. (2009a) and  \nMilan et al. (2009b). Milan et al. (2009a) carried out two superposed epoch analyses of \nmagnetospheric dynamics around substorm onset using observations from both the WIC \nand SI12 auroral imagers onboard the IMAGE spacecraft. The first study consisted of a \nsuperposed epoch analysis of Fpc, AL and AU indices and the SYM-H index for the 10 \nday period from the study of Milan et al. (2008). The 49 substorm events in this study \nwere sub-divided into four categories by the value of Fpc at onset such that \napproximately even numbers of events were found in each bin (~10 events in each bin \nof <0.45 GWb, 0.45-0.55, 0.55-0.65 and >0.65 GWb). The second study used all \nsubstorms identified in the list of Frey et al. (2004) from the two year period of May \n2000 to April 2002. This contained some 2000 substorms which were sub-divided into  \n5 categories by onset latitude (provided in the list of Frey et al., 2004) as a proxy for \nFpc. The results of both studies are consistent with the following: For increasing values \nof Fpc at onset or lower latitude onsets, (1) auroral brightness increases in all phases of \nthe substorm, (2) IMF BBz is more negative and solar wind velocity, density and dynamic \npressure all increase, (3) the AL substorm bay is more pronounced and SYM-H is \nenhanced. \n \nMilan et al. (2009b) estimated the radius of the auroral oval from all auroral images \nobtained by the IMAGE WIC and SI12 detectors between June 2000 and May 2002. \nTheir results indicate that the radius of the auroral oval (a proxy for Fpc) increases for \nincreasing negative SYM-H. Consistent with previous results, they show that, \nstatistically, substorms occurring on expanded auroral ovals are more intense. The \nauthors interpret the increase in auroral oval radius for substorms occurring with \nenhanced ring current intensity as a stabilisation of the magnetotail to the onset of \nreconnection due to the magnetic perturbation caused by the ring current. Inside the ring \ncurrent region, an increase in ring current intensity will result in a negative perturbation \nin the tail BBz component, seen as a negative perturbation in the SYM-H index. Further \ndowntail, the increase in ring current results in a positive BzB  perturbation which acts to \nmaintain depolarization in the tail and hence prevents the thinning of the plasma sheet, \n 37\nstabilising the magnetotail and allowing Fpc to climb to higher levels before the plasma \nsheet is thinned sufficiently enough for reconnection to initiate. \n \nThe results of Milan et al. (2008; 2009a,b) are consistent with both a maximum \nthreshold in Fpc at which substorm onset is induced and a minimum threshold in Fpc at \nwhich reconnection ceases in the tail at the end of the expansion phase which are both \nmodulated by the strength of the ring current; this is represented schematically in Figure \n2.8. Panel a represents the characteristic perturbation of the SYM-H index, a measure of \nthe north south perturbation of the Earths magnetic field strength at the equator, and \nhence a measure of the strength of the ring current (see section 3.6), during a \ngeomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is usually defined by a main phase in which a \nrapid, lasting less than 12 hours, depression of the SYM-H index is seen followed by a \nslow recovery lasting several days. During the main phase the IMF turns strongly \nsouthward resulting in enhanced dayside reconnection and the rapid increase in the \nstrength of the ring current (particularly on the nightside and seen as a large southward \nperturbation in the surface magnetic field strength at the equator of the Earth and a \ndepression in SYM-H). The main phase of storms are often proceeded by a pressure \nstep in the solar wind resulting in the enhancement of the dayside ring current and \nnorthward perturbation in the Earths magnetic field at the equator (positive SYM-H \nperturbation seen in Figure 2.8). Panel b shows the typical behaviour of the radius of the \nauroral oval, which can be assumed to have a direct relation to the size of polar cap and \nhence open magnetic flux, during the storm. Prior to the storm the oval radius increases \nand decreases during substorm growth and expansion phases. In the main phase of the \nstorm the oval radius rapidly increases due to the increased dayside reconnection as the \nIMF turns southward. Subsequently the oval radius gradually decreases as SYM-H \nslowly declines. Throughout this recovery the oval continues to expand and contract \nwith the substorm cycle and the maximum and minimum oval radius slowly decreases \nwith decreasing SYM-H. \n \nThe superposed epoch results of Huang et al. (2009a) also showed that Fpc at onset \nincreased for increased dayside merging electric field (a measure of the dayside \nreconnection rate) and with the Dst index (a measure of the ring current), consistent \nwith the results of Milan et al. (2008, 2009a,b). Huang et al. (2009b) studied the total \npressure and lobe magnetic field strength during sawtooth events. They showed that \n 38\n Figure 2.8: Representation of how the strength of the ring current (as measured \nby the SYM-H index) may modulate the level of open magnetic flux \n(approximated by auroral oval radius) during substorms as postulated by Milan et \nal. (2009b). \nboth lobe field and total pressure are increased at the onset of sawtooth events for \nincreasing magnitudes of solar wind driving, suggesting that sawtooth events occur \nonce some critical state in the magnetotail has been reached and that this state depends \non the solar wind parameters. \n \nSeveral studies have shown there to be a good correlation between various solar wind-\nmagnetosphere coupling functions and Fpc at onset (e.g. Shukhtina et al., 2005).  \nBlockx et al. (2009) studied the correlation between Fpc, the nightside auroral intensity \n(integrated between 18-6 MLT) and the Akasofu energy input parameter for a total of \n256 Frey onset events. The \u03b5 parameter is an empirically determined fraction of the \nsolar wind Poynting flux through the dayside magnetopause (Perreault & Akasofu, \n1978) and is thus a measure of the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere due \nto dayside reconnection, given by: \n \n)2\/(sin 4220 cSW BVl \u03b8\u03b5 = ,         (2.2) \n \nwhere Vsw is the solar wind flow speed, B is the strength of the IMF, \u03b8c is the IMF clock \nangle and l0 is a length constant of ~7 RE. They found a very low correlation between \nthe nightside auroral intensity averaged over the expansion phase and the value of Fpc at \nonset (0.06), the amount of Fpc accumulated in the growth phase (0.27) and the rate of \nincrease of Fpc during the growth phase (0.26). Thus they conclude that Fpc does not \ncontrol the amount of kinetic energy of auroral particles released during substorms. \nThey found a much better correlation between the nightside intensity and the \u03b5 \nparameter integrated over the growth phase of the substorms (0.9) than \u03b5 integrated over \nthe expansion phases (0.66). These results suggest that the loading-unloading process \n(in which energy stored in the magnetosphere during the substorm growth is released \nduring the expansion phase) is statistically more dominant in controlling the energy \nreleased in substorm onsets than the directly driven process (in which solar wind energy \nis directly released in the ionosphere and ring current). \n \nAs discussed earlier, one indicator of the substorm strength are the AL and AU \ngeomagnetic indices. Weimer (1994) carried out a superposed epoch analysis of the AL \nand AE indices of 55 substorm events, showing that the peak activity was reached \n 39\nbetween +25 and +34 minutes relative to onset, after which the indices decayed with a \ntime constant of 1.78-2.42 hours. The results also showed that the peak in intensity was \nreached sooner for events with a larger magnitude at onset and that the following decay \nwas faster for larger magnitude events. \n \nMende et al. (2003) carried out a superposed study of the maximum auroral intensity of \nWIC images across 1 hour MLT sectors of the auroral oval from 91 substorm events \nselected from a period of ~ 1 year starting in June 2000. They found that the intensity at \nthe MLT of the initial onset rapidly increased around onset from approximately 800 to \n4000 counts (see section 3.1.3), reaching a peak at +5 minutes. \n \n2.4.3 Auroral Boundary Motions \n \nAs discussed above, the OCB is an important diagnostic tool for magnetospheric \nphysics. The location and motion of the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval also \nprovides important information on the state and dynamics of the magnetosphere and is \nthought to map to the Earthward edge of the plasma sheet and\/or ion isotropy boundary \n(Mende et al., 2003 and references therein). Although the global expansion and \ncontraction of the auroral oval during substorms has been confirmed by several studies, \nthere are relatively few detailed studies of the local motion of the OCB and equatorward \nboundary of the auroral oval during substorms. \n \nIn chapter 6 of this thesis we further investigate the three distinct categories of \nsubstorms discussed earlier, by carrying out the largest superposed epoch analysis of the \nmotion of the OCB and equatorward boundary of the auroral oval in separate MLT \nsectors during the substorm cycle, to date. A review of previous studies relevant to this \nwork is given below. \n \nThe classic substorm definition of Akasofu (1964) states that the aurora drift \nequatorward in the growth phase of the substorm, before rapidly expanding poleward in \nthe expansion phase. The equatorward motion of the boundaries during the growth \nphase is an indication that the magnetotail is becoming more stretched, while the \npoleward expansion after onset is an indication that the field becomes more dipolar. \nObservations of the global auroral oval from spacecraft have since confirmed that both \n 40\nthe poleward and equatorward boundaries of the auroral oval drift to lower latitudes by \nseveral degrees during the growth phase of substorms before recovering to higher \nlatitudes during the expansion phase (e.g. Craven and Frank, 1987;  \nBrittnacher et al., 1999; Milan et al., 2003). These studies have also shown this average \nbehaviour to be highly variable. For example, the drift of the poleward boundary \ntowards lower latitudes during the growth phase is not concurrent at all MLTs. \nBrittnacher et al. (1999) showed that the poleward boundary moves faster than the \nequatorward boundary in all stages of the substorm process. \n \nTo date, few and limited statistical studies of auroral boundary motions during \nsubstorms have been carried out. Jayachandran et al. (2005) studied the equatorward \nmotion of the equatorward boundary of the proton aurora through 68 substorm growth \nphases using the SuperDARN E-region backscatter boundary as a proxy for the \nequatorward boundary of the auroral oval (Jayachandran et al., 2002). They classified \nthe equatorward motions into two categories; a global equatorward motion seen over \nseveral hours of MLT (47 of 68 events) and a more localised motion seen over only a \nfew hours of MLT encompassing the onset MLT (21 events). Coumans et al. (2007) \nstudied the motion of the OCB and equatorward boundary of the proton auroral \nemission, as observed by the SI12 detector onboard the IMAGE spacecraft, for 55 \nsubstorm events. They showed that the equatorward motion of the boundaries tends to \nincrease for increasing negative values of BBz. This result is not unexpected as previous \nstudies have shown that the polar cap size and rate of increase of Fpc during the growth \nphase of substorms is larger for events with stronger solar wind driving. They also \nfound a correlation of 0.54 between various solar wind-magnetosphere coupling \nfunctions integrated over the growth phase of the substorm and the equatorward motion \nof the OCB, suggesting that the dayside driving plays a role in determining the motion \nof the boundaries. They found that the equatorward boundary mostly moved with a \nglobal motion (either with a similar latitudinal change at all MLTs or with variable \ndegrees of movement at differing MLT sectors) and that the OCB most often moved \nwith a non-uniform equatorward global motion, that is a equatorward motion of the \nOCB at all MLTs but of differing magnitudes, finding no correlation between the MLT \nof the largest boundary motion and the MLT of onset. Gjerloev et al. (2007) used \nobservations from 116 substorm events to show that the average equatorward boundary \nat the onset MLT continues to drift equatorward after onset for up to half an hour before \n 41\nturning poleward by only 0.5\u00b0 over the next hour and a half. They also showed that the \npoleward edge of the auroral substorm bulge expanded poleward by ~ 5\u00b0 in the \nexpansion phase, before slowly recovering towards lower latitudes after ~ 1 hour. \n \nThe largest statistical study of boundary motions to date has been carried out by  \nMende et al. (2003) using global auroral images from the WIC and SI12 detectors \nonboard IMAGE (see section 3.1) and is shown in Figure 2.9. They studied the \nboundary motions at the MLT of the initial auroral brightening and at both \u00b1 2 (green \nand yellow lines Figure 2.9) and \u00b1 4 MLT (blue and red lines Figure 2.9) from the onset \nMLT. Their results showed that both poleward (top set of traces Figure 2.9) and \nequatorward boundaries (bottom set of traces Figure 2.9) slowly drifted equatorward \nduring the growth phase by ~1-2\u00b0 at all MLTs, the poleward boundary moving slightly \nfaster than the equatorward boundary. At onset the poleward boundary moved rapidly to \nhigher latitudes by between 2-5\u00b0, the response being greater and more rapid the closer to \nthe MLT of onset. The motion of the equatorward boundaries at onset is much less \npronounced, with the poleward response to onset not occurring until 5-30 minutes after \nonset, the delay increasing the further from the MLT of onset. The relative motions of \nthe boundaries result in thinning of the auroral oval during the growth phase of the \nsubstorm and subsequent thickening in the expansion phase. The results of this study \nare discussed in more detail in section 6.2 of this thesis. \n \n2.5 Summary \n \nSince the first definition of the growth and expansion phases of the substorm (Akasofu, \n1964), substorms have been the subject of a substantial amount of research for over 40 \nyears. Yet they are still one of the fundamental magnetospheric processes yet to be fully \nunderstood. In particular relation to this thesis, there still remains much controversy \nover the trigger mechanism for substorm onset with some scientists arguing that a solar \nwind trigger is a necessary requirement for substorm onset, whist others argue for a \ncritical threshold internal to the magnetosphere. \n \nOne of the main aims of this thesis is to investigate the idea of a fixed critical threshold \nin the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere as a necessary and\/or sufficient \ncondition for substorm onset. Firstly, in order to accurately estimate the open magnetic \n 42\n Figure 2.9: The latitude of the poleward (top set of traces) and equatorward \n(bottom set of traces) boundaries of the WIC auroral oval from approximately 30 \nminutes prior to substorm onset to 120 minutes after, at the MLT of the initial \nauroral onset (black line) and at -2 (yellow), +2 (green), -4 (red) and +4 (blue) \nMLTs from this location, from a study of 91 substorms by Mende et al., 2003. \nflux content of the magnetosphere, in chapter 4 of this thesis we develop an automated \nmethod of identifying the global location of the open\/closed magnetic field lines \nboundary in the ionosphere from global auroral images taken by the IMAGE spacecraft. \nUsing this method, in chapter 5, we carry out the largest statistical study of the open \nmagnetic flux content of the magnetosphere, to date. The idea of a critical threshold in \nopen magnetic flux for substorm onset is investigated and discussed. We also find that \nnot all substorms show the expected particle injection signature of substorm onset. We \nsub-categorise substorms into three distinct sub-categories by their particle injection \nsignatures and investigate the open magnetic flux, solar wind and IMF, geomagnetic \nactivity, auroral luminosity and auroral oval boundary motions for the three distinct \ncategories in chapter 6 of this thesis in the largest superposed epoch analysis of its type \nto date. A suite of both ground-based and space-based instrumentation has been used in \nthe completion of this thesis. These instruments are discussed in the following chapter. \n 43\nChapter 3. Instrumentation \n \nA range of data from both space and ground-based instrumentation has been used in the \ncompletion of this thesis. In this chapter the main features of these instruments are \nsummarised. \n \n3.1 IMAGE FUV \n \nThe bulk of the work in this thesis is based on imagery of the auroral oval in the far \nultraviolet band of the electromagnetic spectrum by the Far Ultra-Violet (FUV) \ninstrument onboard the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration \n(IMAGE) spacecraft. The IMAGE spacecraft was launched on the 25th March 2000 and \nwas operational between May 2000 and December 2005 when the spacecraft failed. The \nspacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical polar orbit with an apogee of 7 RE and \nperigee a of 1000 km (Burch, 2000). Apogee was initially over the northern hemisphere \n(see Figure 3.1), directly over the northern pole in 2001. Apogee precessed into the \nsouthern hemisphere in 2003. In this thesis observations of the northern hemisphere \nduring the winter months of 2000-2002 are used. During this time the spacecraft spent \nmost of its time far from the Earth and thus mostly observed the aurora from or near \napogee with a temporal resolution of 2 minutes due to the spin period of the spacecraft. \nGlobal auroral imaging was achieved through two FUV imagers, the Wideband Imaging \nCamera (WIC) and Spectrographic Imager (SI). \n \n3.1.1 The Wideband Imaging Camera \n \nThe Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC) (Mende et al., 2000b) was designed to observe \nbroad band ultraviolet auroral emission. A downward-pointing auroral imager in the \n140-190 nm wavelength range will be minimally contaminated by daylight scattered \nfrom clouds and the ground and the aurora can be observed in the presence of high \nlatitude dayglow (Mende et al., 2000a). Figure 3.2 shows the typical auroral emission \nfeatures in the ultraviolet. The WIC detector covers the region populated by weak \nLyman-Birge-Hopfield (LBH) lines (140-190 nm). This emission is primarily caused by \nthe excitation and subsequent decay of N2 to the ground state via a forbidden transition. \n 44\nDecember 2000 January 2001 December 2001 \n     \n \n ZGSM\n (Re) \n  ZGSM \n  (Re) \n    ZGSM \n    (Re) \n  ZGSM \n  (Re) \nZGSM \n(Re) \n   ZGSM \n   (Re) \n  \n XGSM (Re) \n  \n XGSM (Re) \n   \nXGSM (Re)   YGSM (Re)   YGSM (Re)   YGSM (Re)  December 2002 January 2002  \n                                            \n  ZGSM \n  (Re) \n  ZGSM \n  (Re) \n  ZGSM \n  (Re) \n  ZGSM \n  (Re) \n  \n \n \nXGSM (Re) \n   \nYGSM (Re) \n \n  XGSM (Re) \n   \nYGSM (Re) \nFigure 3.1: Orbit of the IMAGE spacecraft for the five months used in this thesis. \nFigure 3.2: Model of the ultraviolet auroral emissions and the geocorona (from \nMende et al. (2000a). \n \nThe excitation of N2 is principally caused by precipitating electrons but up to 20-25% of \nnightside emission can be caused by precipitating protons (Dashkevich et al,. 1996). It \nshould also be noted that secondary electrons produced by the proton aurora have a \nsmall contribution to this emission. \n \nIn order to provide global imagery of the auroral oval the imager must have a field of \nview greater than 15\u00b0 (the angle subtended by the Earth at 7 RE). This is achieved with a \nfield of view of 17\u00b0 \u00d7  17\u00b0 (13300 \u00d7  13300 km). WIC has a nominal pixel field of  \n256  256. A nominal pixel at apogee corresponds to an ionospheric footprint of  \n52 \u00d7  52 km and 1.2 \u00d7  1.2 km at perigee. \n\u00d7\n \nWIC used a Cassegrain Burch type camera (Burch, 1947) to image the aurora. A basic \nschematic of the WIC detector is shown in Figure 3.3. Light enters from the left and is \nreflected by a small primary mirror. The secondary mirror reflects the light towards a \nmicrochannel plate (MCP). In order to filter out wavelengths below 140 nm, a BaF2 \nentrance window is placed in front of the MCP. Photons interact with a photocathode at \nthe front of the MCP, emit photoelectrons through the photoelectric effect which are \nthen accelerated down the channels of the MCP by an accelerating voltage of ~ +4000V \nplaced across the MCP. A CsI photocathode is used to minimize contamination from \nwavelengths longer than 190 nm. An electron cascade is created as secondary \nphotoelectrons are produced by collisions with the walls of the MCP. To avoid \nreflection of electrons back into the MCP, an aluminium coated phosphor is located at \nthe rear of the MCP where the photons emitted are directed along a fiberoptic system to \nthe charge-couple detector (CCD). The CCD outputs the information digitally in the \nform of A-D converted counts, one 8-bit byte per pixel. \n \n3.1.2 The Spectrographic Imager \n \nAt the shortest wavelengths in the FUV spectrum (see Figure 3.2) is the Lyman-alpha \nemission consisting of two components, the cold Lyman-alpha (at 121.5667 nm), \ncaused by geocoronal emission, and the hot, Doppler-shifted emission (121.8 nm) \ncaused by protons precipitating into the upper atmosphere. When a proton enters the \nupper atmosphere it may collide with the neutral atmospheric molecules (mostly N2, O2, \nand O) capturing an electron through charge exchange. It then becomes a fast down-\n 45\ngoing H atom with an excited electron, which, when the electron subsequently \nspontaneously decays to a lower energy level, may emit hot Lyman-alpha emission. In \nsubsequent collisions the H atom may lose another electron, at which point the cycle \ncan repeat itself. The resultant Lyman-alpha emission is Doppler shifted away from the \ndetector. The spectrographic imager SI12 (Mende et al., 2000c) images this Doppler \nshifted Lyman-alpha, the proton auroral emission. \n \nThe brightest emission feature in the aurora is the 130.4 nm OI emission line. However, \nthis is multiply-scattered in the atmosphere. The 135.6 nm line (caused by precipitating \nelectrons) is less scattered and it is this which the SI13 detector observes (Mende et al., \n2000c). \n \nThe requirement to observe the whole auroral oval, separate the Doppler-shifted \nLyman-alpha from the cold Lyman-alpha geocoronal emission and to separately image \nthe 135.6 nm OI emission line from the multiply scattered 130.4 nm line requires \nspecial engineering solutions to achieve the highest possible photon collection and \nefficiency. This is achieved using a novel Imaging Monochromator system, shown \nschematically in Figure 3.4. Light enters through a slit grill and is reflected by the \ncollimator which produces parallel light from any point on the slit. The grating then \ndisperses the light by wavelength. The wavelength separated light is then directed \ntoward two exit slits, one located where the 135.6 nm line appears (this contains a wide \nopen slit for maximizing the light throughput) and the second where the Lyman-alpha \nemission appears (this slit contains a grill to filter out the geocoronal Lyman-alpha at \n121.56 nm that would otherwise dominate the signal). Two reflecting surfaces are \nrequired to provide sufficient aberration correction without lengthening the instrument. \nFinally, the split light is detected at two microchannel plate detectors. To achieve the \nrequired global imaging, the field of view of the SI instrument is 15\u00b0 \u00d7  15\u00b0, giving a \nnominal resolution of 92 \u00d7  92 km per pixel at apogee (Mende et al., 2000c). \n 46\n \n Figure 3.3: Cross section of IMAGE WIC detector (from Mende et al,. \n2000b).  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3.4: Schematic of the IMAGE Spectrographic Imager (from Mende et \nal., 2000c). \n 3.1.3 Image Processing \n \nThe greatest challenge the FUV instruments face is the difficulty in taking high \nresolution and high sensitivity images during the short period that the Earth is in the \nfield of the view of the FUV camera due to the spin of the spacecraft. The FUV camera \npoints radially outward from the spin axis of the spacecraft, which has a spin period of \ntwo minutes. In each two minute rotation a point on the Earth will be in the field of \nview of the WIC detector for ~ 10 seconds and the field of view of the SI camera for  \n~ 5 seconds. The WIC camera images the FUV aurora using a high-speed CCD, read \nout at 30 frames per second. WIC takes approximately 300 separate video frames while \nthe Earth rotates in its field of view, at an exposure time of 33 ms. The distortion caused \nby the spin of the spacecraft is minimal for this time. All images are then superimposed \non each other, offset to account for the spacecraft rotation, and electronic distortion \ncorrection is applied. Thus one image is taken in each two minute spin period over an \nintegration period of 10 seconds. The SI detector works in a similar manner, but \nprocesses individual photons rather than whole images. \n \nThroughout this thesis corrected counts from the IMAGE data are used, where \ncorrections for flatfield, gain of the MCP, etc., have been applied so that one Rayleigh \nof emission always produces the same number of counts wherever in the CCD or MCP. \n \n3.2 DMSP \n \nEstimations of the latitude of the OCB from measurements of the down-going \nprecipitating auroral particles on closed and open magnetic field lines taken by five of \nthe Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites (F11-15) have been \nused in this thesis. Each satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at \nan altitude of 830 km. The location of the OCB has been estimated by identifying the \ntransition between precipitation originating from closed and open magnetic field lines \n(these regions are described in more detail in section 1.3 of this thesis). The energy of \nprecipitating particles are measured by the Precipitating Electron and Ion Spectrometer \n(SSJ\/4) (Hardy et al., 1984). \n \n 47\nThe SSJ\/4 instrument consists of four electrostatic analyzers which record the electron \nand ion fluxes in the range 30 eV to 30 keV. The analyzers are split into two pairs, one \nmeasuring ions and the other electrons. In each pair one detector measures the low \nenergy fluxes while the other is the high energy detector. Each detector cycles through \n10 logarithmically spaced energy channels, dwelling on each channel for 0.09 seconds \nand completing a full energy spectrum in one second. \n \n3.3 LANL Spacecraft \n \nEnergetic particle measurements made by the Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzers \n(SOPA) onboard the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) spacecraft (Belian et al., \n1992) are used in this thesis to classify substorms into three categories based on their \nenergetic particle injection signatures. \n \nThe LANL spacecraft are a set of satellites located at geosynchronous orbit (6.6 RE), \napproximately evenly spaced in longitude around the Earth.  At the time of writing over \n10 satellites are currently in near-earth orbit with typically data from 3-4 satellites \nreceived simultaneously. Each spacecraft has a spin axis aligned so that it points \ntowards the center of the Earth and has a spin period of ~ 10 seconds. The SOPA \ninstrument (Belian et al., 1992) consists of three, nearly identical, silicon solid-state-\ndetector telescopes accepting particles from three different angles relative to the \nspacecraft spin axis (30\u00b0, 90\u00b0 and 120\u00b0), each with a field of view of ~ 11\u00b0. Each \ndetector consists of a thin, 4 \u03bcm, 10 mm2 front detector followed by a thick, 3000 \u03bcm, \n25 mm2 back detector surrounded by aluminium and copper shielding to exclude side-\npenetrating particles. Electron fluxes are measured in 10 energy channels from 50 keV \nto above 1.6 MeV and proton fluxes are measured in 12 channels measuring particles of \n50 keV to 50 MeV. Low energy electron (6 energy channels in the range 50-500 keV, \n50-75, 75-105, 105-150, 150-225, 225-315 and 315-500 keV respectively) and proton  \n(5 energy channels from 50-400 keV, 50-75, 75-113, 113-170,170-250 and  \n250-400 keV respectively) summary plots are used in chapter 5 of this thesis and \nexamples plots are shown in Figures 5.2 to 5.4. \n \n \n \n 48\n3.4 Measurement of Magnetic Fields \n \nData from several different spacecraft and ground-based observatories are used in this \nthesis to provide information on the strength and orientation of IMF and Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic field. Similar measurement techniques are used in all magnetic field \ninstrumentation used in this thesis. These techniques are summarised below. \n \n3.4.1 The Fluxgate Magnetometer \n \nMagnetic fields may be measured in a variety of different ways but by far the most \ncommon used today is the fluxgate magnetometer. A fluxgate magnetometer sensor is \nessentially a transformer wound around a high-permeability core. Two identical primary \ncoils are wound in opposite directions around separate cores. An AC current of equal \nstrength is passed through each coil, oppositely directed in each. The current and \npermeability of the cores are chosen so that the cores will reach saturation (any induced \nmagnetic field in the cores will no longer increase with increasing current) on every \none-half cycle. A secondary coil is wound around both cores such that a voltage will be \ninduced in the secondary coil if the magnetic field produced by the two primary coils is \ndifferent. In the presence of no external field the AC current will induce a magnetic \nfield of equal strength but opposite sign in the two cores. The net field across the two \ncores will thus be zero and no output will be detected. However, in reality there is \nalways a background magnetic field which will induce a background magnetic field of \nequal strength in the two cores. Depending on the direction of the current, the field \ninduced by the primary coil current will add to the magnetic field of one of the cores \nand decrease the magnetic field in the other. This causes saturation to occur more \nquickly in one core, introducing a changing non-zero net field which is measured as a \nvoltage induced in the secondary coil. Knowledge of the permeability of the cores, \nstrength of the AC current and output voltage allows the strength of the background \nmagnetic field parallel to the primary coil axis to be determined. In order to obtain a full \n3-D picture of the magnetic field is it thus necessary to have three sensors aligned \northogonally to each other. Such magnetometers are called triaxial fluxgate \nmagnetometers. \n \n \n 49\n3.4.2 Search Coil Magnetometers \n \nSearch coil magnetometers consist of a single coil which when placed in a changing \nmagnetic field, by Faraday\u2019s law (see Pr\u00f6lss, 2004), will have an induced voltage \nassociated with it. As a voltage will only be induced in a changing magnetic field, \nsearch coil magnetometers can only provide information on the variation of the field, \nand not its strength. \n \n3.5 Solar Wind Monitoring Spacecraft \n \nIn chapter 6 of this thesis we investigate the solar wind plasma and IMF conditions \naround substorm onset. The one-minute resolution OMNI data set has been used (see \nthe OMNIweb page for full details of the data set and its creation; see also King and \nPapitashvivi, 2005). The data set consists of one-minute resolution solar wind plasma \nand IMF data mapped to the location of the Earth\u2019s bow shock nose using the Weimer \nminimum variance technique (see Weimer et al., 2003; Weimer, 2004; Weimer and \nKing, 2008). Data from three spacecraft were used in the production of the data used in \nthis thesis; the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), Wind and Geotail spacecraft. \n \n3.5.1 ACE \n \nThe ACE spacecraft (Stone et al., 1998), launched on the 25th of August 1997, orbits the \nfirst Lagrangian point (L1) located at ~240 RE sunward of the Earth. Spacecraft located \nat the L1 point will remain in an approximately fixed location on the Earth-Sun line \nallowing the constant monitoring of upstream solar wind data. Data from two of the \nsuite of instruments onboard ACE are used in this thesis. The ACE Magnetic Field \nExperiment (MAG) (Smith et al., 1998) provides information on the strength and \norientation of the IMF. Twin triaxial fluxgate magnetometers controlled by a common \nCPU are mounted on the end of two separate 4.19 m long booms emanating from the \ncenter of the spacecraft. This minimises magnetic effects caused by the spacecraft. The \nMAG instrument takes 6 magnetic field vector measurements every second. The Solar \nWind Electron Proton Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM) instrument (McComas et al., 1998) \nprovides electron and ion plasma data. Separate electrostatic analysers measure the ion \n 50\nfluxes in the range 0.26-36 keV and electrons from 1-1350 eV. A  full 3-D energy \nspectrum is produced every 64 seconds. \n \n3.5.2 Wind \n \nThe Wind spacecraft (Franz et al., 2001) was launched in November 1994 to investigate \nthe solar wind and bow shock region. Since 2004, Wind has been in a small circular \norbit at the L1 point. Prior to this the orbit varied with a closest approach to Earth of  \n~ 4.5 RE and apogee of ~ 250 RE. The IMF is measured by the Magnetic Field \nInvestigation (MFI) instrument (Lepping et al., 1995). MFI uses the same boom-\nmounted dual triaxial fluxgate magnetometer system as ACE. One detector is placed at \nthe end of a 12 m long boom, with the second half way down the boom. It is thought \nthat the field produced by the main body of the spacecraft at this distance is only  \n\u00b1 0.1 nT. The solar wind plasma data are measured by the Solar Wind Experiment \n(SWE) instrument (Ogilvie et al., 1995). Electron and proton distributions in the \nenergy\/charge range 7 V to 24.8 kV are provided by the Vector Electron and Ion \nSpectrometer (VEIS). Consisting of two sets of 3 small electrostatic analyzers, the ions \nand electrons are measured sequentially by reversing the analyzer electric field and are \nsubsequently detected by channel electron multipliers. The plasma \u2018key parameters\u2019 \n(velocity, density, temperature) of solar wind ions are measured by a Faraday Cup (FC) \nsystem. A FC system essentially consists of a metal cup which will have a current \ninduced across it when a stream of ions enters it. This current is then read and gives \ninformation on the ion flux striking the detector. Two voltages are applied across the \ndevice so that only ions which satisfy 2\/1 VQEV << , where V1 and V2 are the applied \nvoltages and E and Q are the energy and charge of the incident ions, are passed to the \ndetector allowing a full energy spectrum to be taken. The Wind FC system has an \nenergy\/charge range of 150 V to 8 kV. \n \n3.5.3 Geotail \n \nThe Geotail spacecraft (Nishida et al., 1992) was launched on the 24th of July 1994. \nLaunched into an eccentric orbit near the ecliptic plane (9 \u00d7  30 RE since 1995) the \nprimary mission of the Geotail spacecraft was to investigate the structure and dynamics \n 51\nof the Earth\u2019s deep tail. However, Geotail has several annual solar wind \u2018seasons\u2019 in \nwhich apogee is near the dayside of the Earth and Geotail enters the near-Earth solar \nwind. Magnetic field data are provided by the Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE), \nconsisting of two dual fluxgate magnetometers and one search coil magnetometer which \nmeasure the magnetic field over 7 dynamic ranges from \u00b1 16 nT to \u00b1 65536 nT \n(Kokubun et al., 1994). \n \nPlasma data from the Comprehensive Plasma Instrument (CPI) was used for the data \nused in this thesis. In particularly, the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer measures cool solar \nwind plasma over 64 passbands covering the range 145-6830 V (Frank et al., 1994). \n \n3.6 Ground Based Magnetometers and Geomagnetic Indices \n \nOne minute resolution AL, AU and SYM-H indices are used in chapter 6 to investigate \nthe magnetic field signatures of substorm onset and the ring current. Data are provided \nby the Kyoto World Data Center for geomagnetism. \n \nThe substorm indices, AU and AL, were defined by Davis and Sugiura (1966) and \nprovide a measure of the auroral electrojets relatively uncontaminated from effects of \nthe ring current (Kivelson and Russell, 1995). The indices are derived from a chain of \napproximately 12 ground-based magnetometers, located in the polar regions (Figure 3.5 \nlists typical stations used and shows their location on the Earth). Traces of the H \ncomponent of the magnetic field measured at each station are made. The monthly mean \nvalue from all stations is subtracted from each individual trace so that they are plotted \nrelative to a common baseline. The AL index is then defined at any one instant as the \nlargest negative excursion of any of the traces from the baseline, and the AU index is \ndefined as the maximum positive excursion. Negative excursions in the H component \noccur under a westward travelling current and positive excursions occur under an \neastward travelling current, therefore the AU and AL indices provide a measure of the \nstrength of the eastward and westward electrojets respectively. \n \nThe SYM-H index measures the perturbation of the north south component of the \nEarths magnetic field at the equator and is essentially the same as the hourly Dst index \nbut with one-minute resolution (Wanliss et al., 2006). At the equator the ring current \n 52\n Figure 3.5: Typical polar geomagnetic observatories used in \ndetermining the AL and AU substorm indices (from Auroral \nElectrojet (AE) Indices for January \u2013 December 1992 (provisional), \nWDC for Geomagnetism, Kyoto). \ncauses the largest perturbations in the magnetic field and thus the SYM-H index is a \nmeasure of the strength of the ring current. The SYM-H index is essentially determined \nin the same way as the AL and AU indices using a set of approximately 12 \nmagnetometer stations distributed over the Earth in non-polar regions. Figure 3.6 shows \nproperties of typical stations used in the calculation of SYM-H and their location. The \ncalculation of a baseline value becomes more complicated for SYM-H as the secular \nand diurnal magnetic field fluctuations can be as large as fluctuations caused by large \ngeomagnetic storms. For a full explanation of this procedure see Kivelson and Russell \n(1995). \n 53\n Figure 3.6: Typical geomagnetic observatories used in determining the \nSYM-H index (from Mid-latitude Geomagnetic Indices \u201cASY\u201d and \n\u201cSYM\u201d (Provisional) No. 19 (2008), Data Analysis Center for \nGeomagnetism and Space Magnetism Graduate School of Science Kyoto \nChapter 4. Estimating the Latitude of the Open\/Closed \nMagnetic Field Line Boundary in the Ionosphere \n \nThe location of the open\/closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB) is an important \ndiagnostic tool for magnetospheric physics. Observations of its motion and location are \nwidely used in theories of solar wind-magnetospheric-ionospheric coupling and \ndynamics. For example, it may be used to determine global and local day and nightside \nreconnection rates (e.g. Milan et al., 2003; Hubert et al., 2006) as well as provide \nestimates of the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere  \n(e.g. Milan et al., 2004, 2008), one of the main aims of this thesis. The accurate \ndetermination of its location is therefore of prime importance. \n \nMany different ionospheric measurements have been used over the years to provide a \nproxy for the location of the OCB. A summary of these techniques is given in section \n2.3 of this thesis. Particle precipitation boundaries (PPBs) measured by low-altitude \nspacecraft (such as the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft) \nprovide the most direct and precise determination of boundaries between different \nplasma regions, including the OCB. However, these spacecraft only cross the OCB in \ntwo magnetic local time (MLT) sectors in each hemisphere in any one orbit  \n(~100 minutes for the DMSP satellites) and therefore cannot be used to determine the \nglobal location of the OCB. \n \nCurrently, the best method for estimating the global location of the OCB in any one \nhemisphere is from global auroral imagery provided by orbiting spacecraft (e.g. Carbary \net al., 2003; Milan et al., 2003, 2004, 2008; Hubert et al., 2006). However, recent \nstudies have shown that systematic offsets of up to a few degrees exist between the \nlocation of the OCB as estimated from satellite imagery and as estimated from PPBs \n(e.g. Kauristie et al., 1999; Baker et al., 2000; Carbary et al., 2003). Carbary et al. \n(2003) studied the statistical discrepancy between the DMSP OCB proxies and an OCB \nproxy derived from auroral images taken in the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield \u201clong\u201d (LBHL) \nband (164-178 nm) by the Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) on the Polar spacecraft. They \nshowed that the largest discrepancy occurs in the predawn sector ionosphere, with the \nDMSP proxy found up to ~ 3.5\u00b0 poleward of the UVI proxies at 0500 MLT. A very \n 54\nsimilar discrepancy was found in the predawn sector ionosphere by  \nChisham et al. (2005a,b), comparing the DMSP OCB proxy with an OCB proxy \nprovided by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) Spectral Width \nBoundary (SWB). Wild et al. (2004) presented a case study in which the latitudes of \nboth the SWB OCB proxy and the OCB estimated using the Wideband Imaging Camera \n(WIC) (140-160 nm) onboard the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global \nExploration (IMAGE) spacecraft were placed several degrees equatorward of the OCB \nPPB proxies determined from Cluster, DMSP and FAST spacecraft measurements \nobtained simultaneously in the predawn sector. However they showed that the OCB \ndetermined from the Spectrographic Imager SI13 (~133-138 nm) on board IMAGE was \nclosely co-located with the OCB PPB proxies. They concluded that in the dawn sector \nionosphere the SWB and the poleward boundary of auroral emissions measured by WIC \nwere unreliable proxies for the OCB in this case, with the poleward boundary of SI13 \nemissions providing a more accurate proxy. Other studies have used the poleward \nboundary of SI12 auroral emission (~119-124 nm) in preference to WIC or SI13 OCB \nproxies due to the reduced level of dayglow, making boundary estimation possible even \nin summer months (Hubert et al., 2006). However, these studies did not consider if SI12 \ngave the most reliable estimation of the OCB location. Using IMAGE FUV data,  \nMende et al. (2003) also noted that the proton aurora was found to be displaced \nequatorward of the electron aurora for dusk local times and poleward for dawn local \ntimes during all phases of substorms. \n \nThe aim of this chapter is to investigate the accuracy of using IMAGE FUV \nobservations of the global auroral oval to determine the location of the OCB. Based on \nthe work of Carbary et al. (2003) with Polar UVI auroral images, we firstly develop an \nautomated method of identifying the OCB from IMAGE FUV images. A statistical \ncomparison of the OCB as estimated from the three different FUV detectors onboard \nIMAGE is then performed. To assess the accuracy of the FUV OCB estimation method \nwe then compare the FUV OCB proxies with OCB proxies determined from direct \nmeasurement of precipitating particles made by the DMSP satellites. Combining the \nresults of these two studies, we find systematic offsets between the FUV and DMSP \nOCB proxies which can be used to \u2018correct\u2019 FUV OCB proxies to give a more accurate \nestimation of the location of the OCB in any one MLT sector. \n \n 55\n4.1 A Method for Identifying the Location of the Open\/Closed Magnetic Field Line \nBoundary in the Ionosphere from IMAGE FUV Auroral Images \n \n4.1.1 Instrumentation and Data Set \n \nAuroral imagery of the northern polar cap made by the three FUV detectors onboard the \nIMAGE spacecraft are used in this study. The Wideband Imaging Camera (WIC) and \nspectrographic imagers, SI12 and SI13, are described in detail in chapter 3. WIC views \nthe aurora in the 140-180 nm wavelength range, auroral emissions in this bandwidth are \nlargely from electron transitions. The Spectrographic Imager SI12 observes the proton \naurora with a pass band of 5 nm centered on 121.82 nm and the spectrographic imager \nSI13 observes the \u2018excited electron aurora\u2019 with a pass band of 5 nm centered on the \n135.6 nm. WIC offers the best spatial resolution of approximately 50 km at apogee, \ncompared to approximately 100 km offered by both spectrographic imagers. \n  \nThe IMAGE spacecraft was operational from May 2000 to December 2005, when the \nspacecraft failed. In this study we use northern hemisphere data from December 2000 \nand the January and December months of 2001 and 2002 (see Figure 3.1). After this \ndate the camera pointing became less reliable such that the position of the auroral oval \nmay be offset from its true position by up to 1\u00b0 of latitude. This resulted from the \ndevelopment of a complicated wobble in the spin axis of the spacecraft (the IMAGE \nspacecraft had four long (250 m) antennas positioned 90\u00b0 apart protruding from the \nmain body of the spacecraft and kept stable by the centripetal force of the 2 minute spin \nperiod. At times these antennas had a tendency to snap, causing the weight distribution \nof the spacecraft to become uneven and resulting in a hard to characterise wobble in the \nspin axis). We only use images from December and January as dayglow is much less \nprominent in these months; whilst in other months dayglow often swamps the dayside \nauroral oval, particularly in the WIC data, making the estimation of the dayside OCB \nlatitude impossible. \n \n4.1.2 Methodology \n \nThe method used by Carbary et al. (2003) to identify the location of the OCB from \nPolar UVI (Torr et al., 1995) global auroral imagery forms the basis of the method we \n 56\ndevelop to identify the OCB from IMAGE FUV auroral imagery. Although this method \nwas developed using data from the Polar spacecraft, Lam et al. (2006) have shown that \nthe same method can be successfully applied to other auroral imagers. \n \nThe first step is to create intensity-latitude profiles of the IMAGE FUV auroral oval by \naveraging intensities (corrected counts are used throughout this thesis, see section 3.1.3) \nin bins of one degree of magnetic latitude and one hour of MLT. Examples of intensity-\nlatitude profiles are shown in Figure 4.1 (a-c), where the binned data are represented by \ndiamonds. AACGM coordinates (Baker and Wing, 1989) are used throughout this \nthesis. The solid curves in Figure 4.1 (a-c) represent a fit to the binned data using a non-\nlinear least-square fit (using the IDL Gaussfit routine) to the following function: \n \n2\n543\n2\n2\n1\n0 2\n1exp)( \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb AAA\nA\nAAT +++\u23a5\u23a5\u23a6\n\u23a4\n\u23a2\u23a2\u23a3\n\u23a1\n\u239f\u239f\u23a0\n\u239e\n\u239c\u239c\u239d\n\u239b \u2212\u2212=     (4.1) \n \nwhere \u03bb  is the magnetic latitude and A0-A5 are coefficients of the fit. The Gaussian part \nof equation 4.1 is assumed to represent the auroral oval and the quadratic background is \nassumed to include extraneous airglow, off-axis radiance, or unwanted non-oval aurora. \nA fit is assumed to be successful if the following criteria are satisfied: \n1. The intensity of the Gaussian peak, A0, exceeds 5 counts.  \n2. The magnetic latitude of the peak of the Gaussian, A1, is between 50\u00b0 and 85\u00b0 \nmagnetic latitude. \n3. The Gaussian full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) ( 2ln22 2A=\u0394\u03bb  , where \nA2 is the width of the Gaussian) exceeds 1\u00b0. \n4. The ratio of the background at the center of the Gaussian \n(  ) to the peak of the Gaussian, A215143 .. AAAAAB ++= 0, does not exceed 0.2. \n5. The Gaussian width spans less than 30% of the latitude bins which have non-\nzero intensity, )(3.0 minmax \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb \u2212<\u0394 . \n \nThe latitude of the OCB, OCB\u03bb  (shown by the vertical lines in Figure 4.1 (a-c) and \noverplotted on the auroral images (Figure 4.1 (d-f)) by diamonds), is assumed to be \ndisplaced poleward of the centre of the Gaussian by the Gaussian FWHM such that \n 57\n \nFigure 4.1: (a-c) Intensity-latitude profiles (left-hand column) across a 1 hour MLT \nsector (1800-1900 MLT) and (d-f) images of the auroral oval (right-hand column), \nwith magnetic local noon at the top of the figure, for 20:40:09 on 26 December \n2000. Rows correspond to data from three different IMAGE FUV detectors, SI12 \n(top), SI13 (middle) and WIC (bottom). Average intensities in bins of one degree \nmagnetic latitude are shown by diamonds and the Gaussian plus quadratic \nbackground fits to these points are shown by the solid curves. The position of the \nOCB proxies are marked by the vertical solid lines and overplotted on the auroral \nimages by red diamonds. \n \u03bb\u03bb \u0394+= 1AOCB .        (4.2) \n \nBy visually inspecting the data, it can be seen that on occasion the FUV OCB \nestimation method produces a latitude profile meeting the given criteria above but \nwhich results in an apparently inaccurate boundary estimation (displaced several \ndegrees in latitude from the location estimated by eye). Two particular reasons have \nbeen identified as contributing to this error and these have been correct for in the \nfollowing manner: \n \n(1) The auroral oval can often display a double oval configuration  \n(Elphinstone et al., 1995), particular on the nightside, where the auroral oval consists of \ntwo bright bands or partial ovals of emission separated by a dark band. This causes the \nintensity-latitude profiles to have a multiple peaked nature with two or more Gaussian \nlike components. Normally the Gaussian fitting procedure will fit to the most \nequatorward peak and include the more poleward peaks in the quadratic background \npart of the fit. To find the most accurate location of the OCB these poleward peaks must \nbe included in the Gaussian part of the fit. This is acheived by searching for the most \npoleward peak meeting the criteria 1-5 as follows. The intensity-latitude profile must \ndecrease in intensity over at least two degrees of magnetic latitude in the poleward \ndirection from the latitude of the last peak found, followed by an increase over at least \ntwo degrees of latitude. Once a new maximum in intensity is found the intensity must \ndecrease again over at least two degrees of magnetic latitude. The Gaussian fitting \nprocedure is then applied to the most poleward peak identified below 85\u00b0 magnetic \nlatitude by including only latitudes more poleward of the minimum between the most \npoleward peak and the previous peak in the fitting routine. This will also effectively \nremove dayglow from intensity-latitude profiles when a clear drop in intensity exists \nbetween the poleward edge of dayglow and the equatorward edge of the auroral oval. \n \n(2) Dayglow often extends close to or onto the auroral oval, often completely swamping \nit in the summer months. The noise associated with the dayglow can be larger than the \nauroral signature itself. In most cases the criteria 1-5 reject any identification of the \nOCB. However occasionally this is not the case and the Gaussian function is fit to the \n 58\ndayglow emission rather than the auroral oval emission, placing the OCB estimate at the \npoleward edge of the dayglow, as seen at 1100-1200 MLT in Figure 4.1 (f). Extra \ncriteria are used to try to eliminate these cases as follows. On the dayside  \n(0600-1800 MLT) an OCB proxy is rejected if it has been placed over five degrees \npoleward or equatorward of the proxy found in the previous MLT sector. If the previous \nMLT sector has not produced a proxy the nearest MLT within 4 MLT sectors that has \nproduced a proxy is used. If there are no previous estimations of the OCB within four \nMLTs of the tested MLT sector the MLT sector tested is rejected. \n  \nIf an OCB proxy has not been identified at this point, in a bid to remove dayglow, the \nlower limit of latitudes included in the fitting procedure is increased in steps of one \ndegree until an estimation of the OCB can be found (by reapplying all the above FUV \nOCB estimation method) up to a maximum latitude lower limit of 80\u00b0. A similar \ncorrection as above is applied on the nightside, 0000-0600 MLT and 1800-2400 MLT, \nif the OCB is located over 8\u00b0 poleward or equatorward of adjacent MLTs. The larger \nvalue on the nightside is used as we find, from visual inspection, that the latitude of the \nOCB can genuinely change by between 5-8 degrees, particularly around the auroral \nbulge where at substorm onset the latitude of the OCB is rapidly changing. \n \nThese extra criteria remove many erroneous OCB estimations. However, not all bad \nestimations are caught, as seen in Figure 4.1 (f) 1100-1200 MLT, where the OCB proxy \nis placed equatorward of the poleward edge of the WIC auroral emission but is just \nwithin the five degree condition. These criteria will also not catch poorly estimated \nOCB proxies if several poorly estimated proxies have been made in several adjacent \nMLT bins. \n \n4.2 Statistical Comparison of IMAGE FUV OCB proxies \n \nIn this section we compare the estimate of the OCB latitude from the three different \nFUV detectors, WIC, SI12 and SI13. The FUV OCB estimation method described \nabove is applied to every FUV auroral image obtained by the IMAGE spacecraft from \nthe months of December 2000 and December and January 2001-2002. Comparing FUV \nOCB proxies from different detectors at the same UT and MLT gives a total of 499273 \ncomparisons between WIC and SI12 OCB proxies, 543505 comparisons between WIC \n 59\nand SI13 OCB proxies and 408753 comparisons between SI12 and SI13 OCB proxies, \nwith over 4000 comparisons at each hour of MLT. \n \nLet us define the latitude of WIC, SI12 and SI13 OCB proxies as \u03bbWIC, \u03bbSI12 and \u03bbSI13 \nrespectively. Figure 4.2 shows distributions of the latitude differences between matched \nWIC and SI12 OCB proxies (\u03bbWIC- \u03bbSI12) for four 1-hour MLT bins. Positive values of \nlatitude difference are defined such that the WIC OCB proxy is at higher latitudes than \nthe SI12 OCB proxy. Crosses in Figure 4.2 represent the number of occurrences of \nlatitude differences between WIC and SI12 OCB proxies in bins of 0.2\u00b0 magnetic \nlatitude. In order to reduce small statistical uncertainty smoothing has been applied to \nthe distributions three times using boxcar averaging over five points. Large boundary \ndifferences can be seen in the tails of these distributions. Visual inspection of these \npoints shows that they occur when a poor boundary estimation has been made, and has \nnot been caught by the criteria discussed above, in one or both of the FUV cameras. We \ncharacterise the latitude difference between the FUV OCB proxies by the mode of the \ndistribution (shown by the red vertical lines in Figure 4.2), since this is insensitive to the \npresence of these outliers. Black vertical lines represent the mean of the distributions. \n \nFigure 4.3 shows the variation of the modal FUV OCB proxy latitude differences with \nMLT, for \u03bbWIC-\u03bbSI12 (blue), \u03bbWIC-\u03bbSI13 (black) and \u03bbSI13-\u03bbSI12 (orange). To put the variation \nin context we also provide some information on the width of the distributions and the \nerror on the mode. The width of the latitude difference distributions (Figure 4.2) is \nestimated by moving out from the mode (red line Figure 4.2) in steps of one 0.2 degree \nbin in both positive and negative directions to find the latitude range within which 68% \nof the points lie (which would be equal to the standard deviation for a Gaussian). We \nestimate the error on the mode by dividing the width by N , where N is the number of \npoints in each bin of MLT (equivalent to the standard error on the mean for a Gaussian). \nThe estimated widths are approximately 2\u00b0 and the estimated errors on the mode are \n<0.01\u00b0. \n \nThe modal latitude differences between WIC and SI13 OCB proxies (black curve \nFigure 4.3) are relatively small, <0.8\u00b0. This is not unexpected as both view auroral \nemission excited by electron emission. Larger latitude differences are found between \n 60\n Figure 4.2:  Frequency distribution of the difference between the latitude of WIC and \nSI12 OCB proxies for 0000-0100, 0600-0700, 1200-1300 and 1800-1900 MLT. Crosses \nrepresent the number of boundary differences in 0.2\u00b0 bins of magnetic latitude, red \nvertical lines represent the mode of the distribution and black vertical lines the mean. \n \n Figure 4.3: Mode of OCB proxy latitude differences for \u03bbWIC-\u03bbSI12 (blue), \u03bbWIC-\u03bbSI13 (black) and \u03bbSI13-\u03bbSI12 (orange). The estimated \nwidths of the distributions (explained in the text) are of order 2\u00b0 and the estimated errors on the modes are < 0.01\u00b0. \nthe proton aurora OCB proxies (SI12) and the SI13 or WIC OCB proxies (electrons \naurora). Modal latitudinal differences between WIC and SI12 OCB proxies and between \nSI13 and SI12 OCB proxies (blue and orange curves respectively) are small in the \n0700-1700 MLT range. In the predawn sector SI12 boundaries are found to be located \npoleward of both WIC and SI13 by between 1\u00b0-2\u00b0. Conversely SI12 boundaries are also \nfound to be located at greater than 1 degree equatorward of both WIC and SI13 in the \n1800-2300 MLT range. We discuss these offsets further in section 4.5. \n \n4.3 Comparison with DMSP Auroral Boundaries \n \nGlobal auroral imagery is currently the only method via which the entire auroral oval of \none hemisphere can be viewed simultaneously by a single instrument and is hence \ncurrently the best method of accurately estimating the global location of the OCB. \nHowever, as discussed above, recent studies have shown that systematic offsets of up to \na few degrees exist between the latitude of the OCB as estimated from global auroral \nimagery in the FUV wavelength range and the latitude of the OCB as estimated from \nPPBs (thought to be the most direct and precise measurement of the OCB). In this \nsection we compare the latitude of the OCB as estimated by our IMAGE FUV method \nand the latitude of the OCB as estimated from PPBs from the DMSP spacecraft. \n  \nSotirelis and Newell (2000) used automated techniques to identify the location of \ndifferent auroral boundaries (including the OCB) from the energy flux of down-going \npolar precipitating particles as seen by particle analyzers onboard the DMSP satellites. \nThe location of the OCB was determined using the definition of different ionospheric \nprecipitation regions described by Newell et al. (1991a) and Newell et al. (1996), \ndiscussed in section 1.3 and summarised in Figure 1.10 of this thesis. On the nightside, \nthe OCB is given by the b6 boundary of Newell et al. (1996), which marks the \ntransition from the poleward edge of the sub-visual drizzle region to particle fluxes \nbelow detectable levels or the first encounter with polar rain (see Figure 1.10). On the \ndayside the OCB is given by the doc (dayside open\/closed) boundary, located where \nthere is an unambiguous transition between precipitation characteristic of open and \nclosed field lines. The central plasma sheet, boundary plasma sheet and low latitude \nboundary layer (LLBL) are considered to be closed, and cusp, mantle, open LLBL, \npolar rain and void (a lack of precipitating particles) are considered to be open. If any of \n 61\nthese transitions are not clear, because of ambiguities in the region, then an OCB proxy \nis not identified (Chisham et al., 2005b). Data from five DMSP spacecraft (F11-15) for \nthe years 2000-2001 were used in this study. For a full description of the DMSP \nsatellites and their SSJ\/4 particle analyzers see section 3.2 of this thesis. \n \nDMSP OCB proxies are compared to the closest (in both UT and MLT) FUV OCB \nproxy within 0.5 hours of MLT and \u00b1 \u00b1 10 minutes of UT, producing over 1700 \ncomparisons for each FUV detector. However, due to the orbit of the DMSP spacecraft, \nno DMSP boundaries are available in the northern hemisphere between 2200 and 0500 \nMLT. \n \nThe latitude differences are binned into bins of 0.5\u00b0. To reduce the statistical uncertainty \nand produce a smooth distribution with one clear peak the distributions have been \nsmoothed three times using a boxcar average over five points. Figure 4.4 shows \nexample distributions of latitude differences between DMSP and WIC OCB proxies for \nfour 1-hour MLT bins, where \u03bbDMSP is the latitude of the DMSP OCB proxy. The \nsmoothed latitude differences are shown by the crosses and vertical lines show the mean \n(black) and modes (red) of the distributions. The distributions are skewed to the right \nsuch that there is a higher probability of finding a DMSP OCB proxy at a significantly \nhigher latitude than the equivalent FUV proxy than there is of finding an FUV OCB \nproxy at a higher latitude. We find three possible factors which may contribute to these \nlarge differences: \n \n1. The method of FUV OCB proxy estimation. When a poor FUV OCB proxy \nestimation is made (and is not caught by the criteria discussed in section 4.1.2) it is \nnearly always placed equatorward of the poleward edge of the auroral oval emission and \nis therefore more equatorward of the equivalent DMSP boundary than should be the \ncase. \n \n2. The use of finite MLT and UT windows in the comparison procedure. The fine scale \nstructure of the OCB may change by small amounts over these window sizes. Reducing \nthe size of the windows reduces the width of the distributions but also reduces the \nnumber of comparisons available. \n \n 62\nFigure 4.4: Smoothed frequency distributions for \u03bbDMSP-\u03bbWIC for (a) 0600-0700 \nMLT, (b) 1200-1300 MLT, (c) 1600-1700 MLT and (d) 2000-2100 MLT in bins \nof 0.5\u00b0 magnetic latitude. Vertical black lines show the mean of the distributions \nand red lines represent the mode. \n \n \n3. Failure of the DMSP OCB estimation procedure. The DMSP OCB estimation is made \nusing an automatic algorithm which will occasionally fail. \n \nThe mean of the distributions, shown by the black vertical lines, is shifted towards this \ntail. We therefore use the mode of the distributions, shown by the red vertical lines, to \ncharacterise the centre of the distribution. \n \nFigure 4.5 (a-c) shows the variation with MLT of the modal latitude differences \nbetween the FUV and DMSP OCB proxies. The horizontal lines at the center of the \nestimated error bars represent the mode of the latitude differences in bins of 1 hr MLT. \nThin error bars represent the estimated width and the thick error bars represent the \nestimated error on the mode as explained in section 4.2. Due to the relatively low \nnumber of DMSP-FUV OCB proxy comparisons the estimated widths are fairly large \n(3\u00b0-4\u00b0), exceeding the size of the offsets themselves, although the estimated error on the \nmode is smaller (<1\u00b0). \n \nFollowing the method set out by Carbary et al. (2003), a continuous function is fitted to \nthe data which extrapolates into MLTs where no DMSP boundaries are available.  \nA weighted second-order harmonic fit is applied to the modal latitude differences using \na least squares fit, \n \n\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5\u03d5 2sin2cossincos)( 22110 DCDCCL ++++=      (4.3) \n \nwhere \u03d5  is the angle associated with the MLT ( \u00b0\u00d7\u2261 15MLT ), and C and D are \ncoefficients of the fit. Weights are n\/max(n) where n is the number of boundary \ncomparisons in each one hour MLT bin. The harmonic coefficients determined by \nCarbary et al.

Between 0700 and  \n2300 MLT the fits to latitude differences typically differ by less than a degree. In \ncontrast the average latitude difference between DMSP and SI12 is larger in the evening \nsector (1600-2400 MLT) and smaller in the morning sector (0-7 MLT), by up to 2\u00b0. \n \n4.4 Boundary Optimization \n \nIn order to test the validity of our IMAGE FUV OCB approximation method, we wish \nto compare the latitude of the OCB as estimated by our method with the true location of \nthe OCB. Above, we find systematic offsets between the FUV and DMSP OCB proxies \nconsistent with previous studies (e.g. Carbary et al., 2003). Assuming the DMSP OCB \nproxy to be the best estimate of the OCB, we believe that these offsets give a good \napproximation to the offset between FUV OCB proxies and the true location of the \nOCB and may be used to provide a \u2018correction\u2019 to FUV OCB proxies to provide a more \naccurate global estimation of the OCB. However, at individual MLTs there are \ninconsistencies between the DMSP-FUV comparisons and the inter-FUV comparisons. \nThat is, if both results were completely consistent, then the curves of Figure 4.5 should \nbe consistent with the curves of Figure 4.3, such that the curve of )( 12SIDMSP \u03bb\u03bb \u2212  minus \nthe curve of  from Figure 4.5 should lie exactly on top of the curve of )( WICDMSP \u03bb\u03bb \u2212\n)( 12SIWIC \u03bb\u03bb \u2212  of Figure 4.3. However, this is not seen with small discrepancies found at \nseveral MLTs. Given the considerably larger number of comparisons used in the inter-\nFUV comparisons it is desirable to use these results to enhance our best estimate of the \nsystematic offsets of the FUV OCB proxies from the (unknown) true location of the \nOCB. We do this by considering characteristic latitudinal offsets of the WIC, SI12, SI13 \nand DMSP proxies, which we designate as W, P, E, and D respectively. \n \nRelating the characteristic latitudinal offsets W, P, E, and D at each MLT to the values \nshown in Figures 4.3 and 4.5 produces the following set of equations; \n \n \n \n 64\naxaPW SICWI +=+\u2212=\u2212 112\u03bb\u03bb         (4.4) \nbxbEW SIWIC +=+\u2212=\u2212 213\u03bb\u03bb          (4.5) \ncxcEP SISI +=+\u2212=\u2212 31312 \u03bb\u03bb            (4.6) \ndxdWD WICDMSP +=+\u2212=\u2212 4\u03bb\u03bb            (4.7) \nexePD SIDMSP +=+\u2212=\u2212 512\u03bb\u03bb          (4.8) \nfxfED SIDMSP +=+\u2212=\u2212 613\u03bb\u03bb        (4.9) \n \nwhere a, b, c, d, e, and f are unknown measurement errors and <> indicate an ensemble \nproperty, for which the mode has been used. Comparing the curves in Figure 4.3 shows \nthat the unknown errors, a, b, and c are insignificant (that is, for the blue, black and \norange curves in Figure 4.3 respectively, )()()( 12131312 SISISIWICSIWIC \u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb\u03bb \u2212=\u2212\u2212\u2212 ), \nand so these were set to zero (however, if a, b, and c are considered to be non-zero, a \nfull treatment leads to the same result).

Latitude difference is shown by the radial \ncoordinates. These optimised boundary offsets can be applied to the FUV OCB \nboundaries to give a more accurate global location of the OCB. \n \n 65\n Figure 4.6: Optimally estimated latitude differences between WIC (dark blue), SI13 \n(red) and SI12 (green) OCB proxies relative to the latitude of the DMSP OCB proxy \n(orange). Latitude differences between DMSP and Polar UVI OCB proxies from \nCarbary et al. (2003) are shown by black rectangles and the black dashed line shows \nthe extrapolated fit to all MLTs. Radial coordinates represent latitude difference \nrelative to the DMSP OCB proxy in degrees. \n \n4.5 Discussion \n \nIn this chapter the latitude of the OCB as estimated from auroral images from the WIC, \nSI12 and SI13 FUV detectors onboard the IMAGE satellite and from particle \nprecipitation measurements from the DMSP spacecraft have been compared. \n \nFigures 4.3 and 4.6 show that at most MLTs the average modal difference in the latitude \nbetween the WIC, SI12 and SI13 OCB proxies is statistically small (<1\u00b0), although in \nany one MLT bin differences may be larger. Larger average discrepancies are seen in \nthe evening and predawn sectors. In the evening (1800-2300 MLT) sector SI12 OCB \nproxies can be located between 1-2 degrees equatorward of WIC and SI13 OCB proxies \nand 1-2 degrees poleward of WIC and SI13 OCB proxies in the predawn (0300-0600 \nMLT) sector. These offsets may be explained by the morphology of the magnetospheric \ncurrent systems, discussed below. \n \nIn the dawn sector ionosphere region-1 Field Aligned Currents (FACs) are directed \ndownward into the ionosphere and vice-versa in the evening sector (see Figure 1.9b). \nEquatorward of region-1 currents are region-2 FACs directed oppositely to region-1 \nFACs (Iijima and Potemra, 1978; see Figure 1.9b). Upward FACs are associated with \ndown-going electrons and are therefore associated with the WIC and SI13 electron \nauroral emission (although these also have a small contribution from secondary \nelectrons produced by the proton aurora). The dominant charge carrier associated with \ndownward FACs is less clear but if they are assumed to be associated with down-going \nprotons (Cran-McGreehin and Wright, 2005) then we may expect downward FACs to \nbe associated with the SI12 auroral emission. We would therefore expect to see WIC \nand SI13 auroral emission poleward of SI12 emission in the evening sector and \nequatorward in the dawn sector, as seen in this study. It is also interesting to note that \nthe offsets between FUV proxies are small on the dayside and do not follow the \nmorphology of the FACs. However, it is known that the location at which region-1 and \nregion-2 currents switch from upwards to downwards varies over a large MLT range in \nthis sector depending on the orientation of the IMF By component (Weimer, 2001). \nOver large time scales the average of the IMF By component is close to zero and \ntherefore the boundary offsets seen are also close to zero in this MLT sector. \n \n 66\nFigures 4.5 and 4.6 show that in the predawn sector the SI12 OCB proxy is in better \nagreement with DMSP OCB proxy than either the WIC or SI13 OCB proxies, but is still \nlocated over 1\u00b0 equatorward of the DMSP proxy, which is thought to be the best proxy \nfor the OCB. Previous studies (Wild et al., 2004) have suggested that WIC may be an \nunreliable proxy for the OCB in the predawn sector whilst others (Hubert et al., 2006) \nhave used SI12 in preference to SI13 or WIC when determining the global OCB due to \nthe reduced dayglow in SI12 rather than the accuracy of the detector in determining the \nlocation of the OCB. The work in this chapter confirms that SI12 may be a better \nestimation for the OCB in the predawn sector. However, Figures 4.5 and 4.6 show that \nat all later magnetic local times the WIC and SI13 OCB proxies are either in better \nagreement with DMSP proxies or as good as the SI12 proxy. The most accurate global \ndetermination of the OCB may therefore be obtained by using the individual FUV \ndetector which has the best correlation with the DMSP OCB proxy in any one MLT \nsector. For example SI12 in the 0100-0700 MLT range, WIC at 0700-0800, SI13 at \n0800-1600 MLT, SI12 at 1600-1700 MLT, SI13 at 1700-2200 and WIC at 2200-0100 \nMLT. For single instrument studies WIC may produce the best proxies for the global \nOCB due to its good global correlation with the DMSP OCB proxy and its better spatial \nresolution. It should also be noted that the FUV OCB proxies are found poleward of the \nequivalent DMSP proxy at dayside MLTs. Near noon there is frequently more particle \nflux on open field lines (cusp, mantle, etc, see section 1.3.4 and Figure 1.10a) than \nclosed, particularly in SI12 which is likely seeing cusp protons. Cusp precipitation, in \nparticular, is of a much higher energy than that of polar rain and can cause bright \nauroral emission well above the FUV background level. The resolution of the WIC \ndetector is such that a sharp transition is not seen between cusp and the main auroral \noval precipitation. Instead this boundary is \u2018smoothed\u2019 in the WIC intensity-latitude \nprofiles such that cusp precipitation may be included in the Gaussian part of the fitting \nroutine described in section 4.1, increasing the Gaussian half width and thus shifting the \nOCB proxy to higher latitudes. DMSP is able to see the direct transition between the \ncusp and main oval precipitation. Counting the cusp precipitation as occurring on open \nfield lines, this places the DMSP OCB proxy at a lower latitude than that equivalent \nWIC OCB proxy. Conversely, on the nightside and particularly in the dawn-sector \nionosphere a region of low-energy precipitation thought to be on closed magnetic field \nlines is often found poleward of the main auroral oval (see section 1.3), its intensity \ndecreasing poleward and towards the dayside. This low energy precipitation is not much \n 67\nstronger than polar rain on open field lines, and produces only weak auroral emission. \nThis weak auroral emission is therefore included in the background part of the Gaussian \nfitting procedure described above such that sub-visual precipitation is considered open. \nThe higher spatial resolution of the DMSP particle analysers are able to directly \ndetermine the sharp transition between polar rain and the sub-visual drizzle region, \nresulting in the DMSP OCB proxy being placed at a higher latitude than the equivalent \nFUV proxy on the nightside. \n \nFigures 4.5 and 4.6 confirm that systematic differences exist between estimations of the \nOCB from DMSP particle precipitation measurements and FUV auroral imagers, \nsimilar to the differences seen between DMSP and radar derived OCB proxies as \npresented by Chisham et al. (2007). These systematic differences may be used to \n\u2018correct\u2019 auroral boundaries to give a more accurate determination of the OCB. \nUnfortunately due to the low number of comparisons available at each hour of MLT \nbetween the DMSP and FUV OCB proxies and the lack of data available in the predawn \nsector (where the extrapolated offsets are largest) the uncertainties involved in this \ncorrection are not insignificant. To produce the most reliable distributions the modes of \nthe OCB proxy latitude differences have been used and smoothing has been applied. \nHowever, using the mean of the latitude differences, or applying different degrees of \nsmoothing, can change the fits to the DMSP-FUV OCB proxy differences in the \npredawn sector (where the fit is interpolated) by up to a degree. Therefore, we can only \nreliably trust the DMSP correction where DMSP data are available (0600-2100 MLT). \nHowever, as a best guess of the location of the OCB, we believe that applying this \ncorrection will statistically give a more accurate result than using the uncorrected FUV \nOCB proxies. \n \n4.6 Summary \n \nIn this chapter we have developed a method of identifying the location of the \nopen\/closed magnetic field line boundary from IMAGE FUV auroral images and have \nassessed its validity. \n \nBy comparing over 400000 OCB proxies estimated from the IMAGE WIC, SI13 and \nSI12 FUV detectors and from auroral images obtained in December 2000 and \n 68\nDecember and January 2001-2002, it has been shown that systematic differences exist \nbetween the latitude of the OCB as estimated by the three detectors. Statistically the \nOCB proxy differences are small (<1\u00b0) except in the predawn sector where the SI12 \nOCB proxy is found, on average, to be located up to 2\u00b0 poleward of the WIC and SI13 \nOCB proxies and in the evening sector where the SI12 OCB proxy can be located up to \n2\u00b0 equatorward of SI13 and WIC OCB proxies. \n \nCorrelating FUV OCB proxies with the DMSP OCB proxy confirms that the SI12 OCB \nproxy is found poleward of the WIC and SI13 OCB proxies in the predawn sector, in \nbetter agreement with the DMSP OCB proxy. The WIC and SI13 OCB proxies are \nfound to be in better agreement with the DMSP OCB proxy at all other MLTs. \nSystematic offsets are found between the DMSP and FUV OCB proxies which may be \nused to \u2018correct\u2019 FUV OCB proxies to give a more accurate estimation of the true \nlocation of the OCB. In the following chapter we develop this method to produce an \nautomated method of identifying the global location of the OCB from IMAGE FUV \nauroral images, allowing us to accurately determine the area of the ionospheric polar \ncap and hence estimate the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere. \n 69\n Chapter 5. A Statistical Study of the Open Magnetic Flux \nContent of the Magnetosphere at the time of Substorm \nOnset \n \nIn the previous chapter we developed an automated method of identifying the location \nof the open\/closed magnetic field line boundary (OCB) in the ionosphere at any one \nMLT from global auroral images taken by the IMAGE spacecraft. In this chapter we \nfurther develop this method to produce a semi-automated technique of accurately \nidentifying the global location of the OCB, allowing us to determine the size of the \npolar cap and hence estimate the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere. This \nmethod is then applied to over 12,000 auroral images of the northern polar cap to \nproduce the distribution of the average open magnetic flux content of the \nmagnetosphere, which we hereon name the parent distribution, the largest such study to \ndate. From this parent distribution we select the distribution of open magnetic flux at the \ntime of substorm onset using the Frey list of substorm onset times (see section 2.4.1). \nWe compare the average open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere to that at the \ntime of substorm onset and discuss in terms of various triggering mechanisms for \nsubstorm onset. \n \nWe also find that not all substorms in this study show the expected particle injection \nsignature of substorm onset. Splitting substorms into three categories based on their \nparticle injection signatures we find that those substorms which show a clear particle \ninjection signature occur, on average, at higher values of open magnetic flux than those \nshowing no activity. \n \n5.1 Methodology \n \n5.1.1 Estimating the Open Magnetic Flux Content of the Magnetosphere \n \nWe estimate the hemispheric open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere (Fpc) by \ndetermining the global location of the OCB from global auroral images taken by the \nIMAGE spacecraft. Since the OCB marks the delineation between magnetic field lines \nof open and closed topology, the dark region poleward of the OCB, known as the polar \n 70\ncap, is threaded by open magnetic flux. Thus by simply summing the radial component \nof the Earth\u2019s magnetic field through the area of the polar cap gives us an estimate of \nFpc. \n \nIn the previous chapter we developed an automated method of identifying the OCB in \nany one MLT sector using global auroral imagery taken by the three FUV detectors \nonboard the IMAGE spacecraft. Comparing the latitude of the OCB as estimated by \nFUV auroral images and as estimated from direct measurements of down-going \nprecipitating particles as measured by the DMSP satellite, thought to provide the best \nproxy for the OCB, showed that systematic offsets exist between the two methods. OCB \nestimates from the spectrographic imager SI12 were found to be in better agreement \nwith DMSP OCB proxies in the dawnward ionosphere, but OCB estimates from the \nWideband Imaging Camera (WIC) and SI13 detector gave at least as good a proxy for \nthe OCB, if not better, at other MLTs. WIC provides a better spatial resolution (~50 km \nat apogee) than either spectrographic imager (~100 km at apogee) and it is data from \nWIC which we use in this study. The same data set as used in the previous chapter is \nutilised. That is, we use all auroral images taken by WIC of the northern hemispheric \npolar cap for the months of December 2000 and December and January 2001-2002. \nAfter this date the WIC data became less reliable (as explained in chapter 4). During the \nsummer months dayglow obscures much of the dayside auroral oval making the \ndetermination of the dayside OCB difficult if not imposable from FUV auroral images. \nThus we use images from winter months only. During this period the IMAGE \nspacecraft can image the northern polar cap with a temporal resolution of 2 minutes due \nto the spin period of the spacecraft and for approximately 10 hours of its\u2019 ~14 hour orbit \n(see Figure 3.1). Thus our primary data set consists of some 77,000 images. \n \nThe method to identify the OCB at individual MLTs is described in detail in section 4.1 \nof this thesis and briefly summarised below. Each auroral image is divided into 24 \nlatitudinal profiles, each 1 hour of MLT wide. The latitudinal variation of the \nlongitudinally-averaged intensity within each profile is fitted by a Gaussian plus \nquadratic function. Here, the Gaussian is expected to fit to the latitudinal profile of the \nauroral oval, whereas the quadratic fits to any background luminosity, including \ndayglow. The fit is accepted if the criteria given in section 4.1.2 of this thesis are met. \nThe auroral oval intensity-latitude profiles often display a double Gaussian-like feature \n 71\nwith more than one peak in intensity. Thus extra criteria are employed to search for the \nmost poleward peak in auroral intensity. The OCB is then assumed to be placed \npoleward of the center of the most poleward Gaussian fit meeting the fitting criteria by \nthe Gaussian full-width-at-half-maximum. We then \u2018correct\u2019 these boundary estimations \nby applying the systematic offsets found between DMSP particle precipitation \nboundaries and the IMAGE WIC boundary estimations as shown by the blue curve in \nFigure 4.5. \n \nFigure 5.1 shows three examples of auroral images from WIC with differing values of \nFpc. The positions of the OCB estimated in each hour of MLT are shown by diamonds. \nVisual inspection shows that this method gives a good estimate of the expected OCB \nlatitude at most MLTs. However this is not always the case, as seen, for instance, at  \n04-05 MLT in Figure 5.1b. Here the OCB estimation has been placed at a higher \nlatitude than its position as suggested by eye. Also, the fitting procedure can fail at \nseveral MLTs, as seen between 10-15 MLT in Figure 5.1c, resulting in no boundary \nidentifications. Linear interpolation is used to provide an estimate of the OCB in such \ncases. However, if the boundary estimation fails in more than six MLT sectors we reject \nthe image (approximately 5\/6 of the available auroral images are rejected in this way). \nIn order to smooth out the poor estimations and increase the statistical reliability of the \nOCB estimates we apply a truncated six-point Fourier Transform, equivalent to a least \nsquares fit of a sixth order Fourier series (Hamming, 1989), to the boundary estimations \nto give the final global estimation of the OCB, shown by the thick dashed line in Figure \n5.1a-c. This returns 48 separate estimations of the OCB latitude around the auroral oval, \nseparated by a half hour of MLT. \n \nTo calculate Fpc for each image, we numerically integrate the radial component of an \nassumed dipolar magnetic field along 48 latitudinal meridians, each a half hour of MLT \nin width, in steps of 0.5\u00b0 of latitude from the magnetic pole to the OCB latitude. That is: \n \n\u222b\u222b ==\npc\nr\npc\npc dsBdsBF . ,        (5.1) \n \nwhere BBr is the radial component of the Earths magnetic field, which at the height of the \naurora, r (which we take to be 150 km), is given by \n 72\n Figure 5.1: Auroral images from the IMAGE WIC FUV detector for three \ndifferent values of open magnetic flux, (a) 13th January 2002 08:54:41 UT, \n GWb, (b) 2636.0=pcF th December 2001 02:02:07 UT, GWb, \n(c) 23\n57.0=pcF\nrd December 2000 04:49:49 UT, 97.0=pcF  GWb.

Running from the pole to the \nobserved latitude of the OCB at the appropriate MLT in steps of 0.5\u00b0 colatitude and \naround 48 MLT sectors, we sum the product rBA\u00d7  for each element such that the total \npolar cap flux is given by \n \n\u2211\n=\n\u00d7=\nN\nn\nnrnpc BAF\n1\n, ,        (5.4) \n \nwhere N is the number of elements. \n \nIt is difficult to estimate the uncertainty in the flux calculation, but, as an extreme \nexample, if we assumed the latitude of the OCB at all MLTs to be systematically under \nor over estimated by 1\u00b0 then this would lead to an increase or decrease of open magnetic \nflux of about \u00b1 10% (Milan et al., 2003). If we assumed that the latitudinal differences \nbetween the WIC OCB proxies and the DMSP OCB proxies, as presented in Figure 4.5, \nrepresented the errors on the OCB estimation then for a circular polar cap with a \nconstant latitude of 70\u00b0 at all MLTs, corresponding to an Fpc of ~ 0.88 GWb, this would \ninduce an error of ~4% on the Fpc estimation. For a circular OCB with constant latitude \nof 75\u00b0, corresponding to an Fpc of ~ 0.51 GWb, the error is ~ 6%. Both of these are \nlower than the 10% suggested by a systematic over or under estimation of 1\u00b0. \n \n 73\n  \n5.1.2 Selection of Parent and Substorm Distributions \n \nApplying the above method to all WIC auroral images from December 2000 and \nDecember and January of 2001 and 2002 returns an estimate of Fpc from 12731 auroral \nimages, the occurrence distribution of which we shall hereafter call the parent \ndistribution. \n \nUsing the list of substorm onsets compiled by Frey et al. (2004), we find the subset of \nFpc occurring at the time of substorm onset, the occurrence distribution of which we \nhereafter call the substorm distribution. Frey et al. identified onsets from auroral images \ntaken by the IMAGE FUV detectors using the following criteria using the criteria listed \nin section 2.4.1. \n \nWe are unable to determine Fpc for many of the images at onset due to a failure to \ndetermine the latitude of the OCB in a sufficient number of MLT bins. Thus to increase \nthe size of the substorm distribution, we take the average of Fpc from all available \nvalues within 4 minutes of every onset time such that a value of Fpc at the onset time is \nnot required. Of the 451 substorms in the Frey onset list for the months of this study, we \nare able to determine Fpc for 173 substorm onsets. Note that these averaged estimates \ninclude those times when an Fpc estimate has been made at the onset time. Comparing \nthe values of Fpc using this averaging method and obtained at the onset time only we \nfind that the averaging process adds an additional uncertainty on estimates of Fpc of  \n~ 0.03 GWb and adds an additional 48 events to the substorm distribution. \n \n5.1.3 LANL Substorm Classification \n \nAnother signature of substorm onset is the enhancement of energetic particle fluxes at \ngeosynchronous orbit (see section 2.1.2). A typical example of an isolated substorm \ninjection signature, as seen by particle analysers onboard three of the LANL spacecraft \n(see section 3.3) is shown in Figure 5.2. Panel a shows electron fluxes and panel b \nproton fluxes. The time of substorm onset is marked by the vertical white line and the \ntimes the spacecraft are located at midnight and noon MLTs are shown by the vertical \n 74\nblue and yellow lines respectively. The MLT of the spacecraft at the time of substorm \nonset is marked on each panel. At the onset MLT (22 MLT in Figure 5.2), prior to \nsubstorm onset a drop-out in energetic particle fluxes is seen. It is thought that this is \ncaused by the thinning of the plasma sheet during the growth phase, causing the \nspacecraft to move out of the plasma sheet region (e.g. Moldwin et al., 1996). At onset, \na dispersionless injection of energetic particles is seen in all energy channels, raising the \nflux levels well above nominal values. The injection signature becomes dispersed as the \nparticle subsequently gradient and curvature drift around the Earth (see Figure 1.4). \nElectrons drift eastward and protons drift westwards around the Earth such that the \ndispersed signature is seen at the LANL spacecraft located at 10 MLT in Figure 5.2 \nprior to the spacecraft located at 16 MLT for electrons, and vice-versa for protons. We \nclassify substorms into three distinct categories depending on their particle injection \nsignatures: \n \n1. \u2018Classical\u2019 substorm injection signature. \n2. Unclear activity. \n3. No activity.  \n \nSubstorms falling in category 1 will normally have a clear dispersionless enhancement \nin the midnight sector, followed by dispersed enhancements seen in other satellites \n(typically two or more) at other local times (Belian et al., 1978; Baker et al., 1979). \nEvents when no satellite data are available in the midnight sector but a dispersed \nsignature is seen by at least three other satellites, consistent with gradient-curvature drift \nfrom a dispersionless enhancement at midnight, are also included in this category. \nFigure 5.2 is an example of such an event. Category 2 covers all other energetic particle \nfluctuations not falling within category 1, an example of a category 2 onset is shown in \nFigure 5.3. Category 3 events show no fluctuations in any of the LANL spacecraft. To \nbe included in this category data must be available in the midnight sector. An example \nof a category 3 event is shown in Figure 5.4.

The substorm probability distribution, )()( sFpFp pcs = , \nis shown by the shaded histogram in Figure 5.5a. The open magnetic flux of the parent \ndistribution is seen to vary between ~0.2 and 0.9 GWb with a mean value of  \n52.0=pcF  GWb. The open magnetic flux at substorm onset varies between 0.3 and  \n0.9 GWb with a mean value of 58.0=sF  GWb. Applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov \n(K-S) statistical test (Press et al., 2007) to the two distributions verifies that the \nprobability of rejecting the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same is \ngreater than 0.999. \n \nThe shaded histograms in Figures 5.5b-e show the distributions of open magnetic flux \nfor category 1, 2, 3 and category 1&2 substorms respectively, determined from the \nLANL spacecraft as defined above. We combine categories 1 and 2 so as to include all \npossible onset signatures. Of the 173 substorm onsets in the total substorm distribution, \n135 have available LANL spacecraft data. Of these, 61 (45%) fall within category 1,  \n39 (29%) fall in category 2 and 35 (26%) fall in category 3. Substorms occurring in \ncategories 1 and 2 tend to occur at higher values of Fpc than those occurring in category \n3, with all three categories being significantly different from one another, and from the \nparent distribution, according to the K-S test. The mean values of Fpc for the different \nsubstorm categories are as follows; 66.01 =F  GWb, 59.02 =F  GWb,  \n63.02&1 =F  GWb and 48.03 =F  GWb. \n \n5.2.2 Probability of Substorm Onset as a Function of Open Magnetic Flux \n \nFrom Bayes\u2019 theorem (see Press, 2007), the probability )( pcFsp  of substorm onset \noccurring in an image at a given value of open magnetic flux can be derived from the \nprobability distributions shown in Figures 5.5a-e according to \n \n 76\n Figure 5.5a-e: Fractional occurrence, left axis, of parent distribution of open \nmagnetic flux (unfilled histogram in all panels) and for (a) all substorms, (b) \ncategory 1, (c) category 2, (d) category 3 and (e) category 1&2 (shaded \nhistograms). The right hand axis shows the number in each bin for the relevant \nsubstorm distribution. (f-i) Probability of substorm onset as a function of open \nmagnetic flux for, (f) all substorms (unfilled histogram repeated in all panels), \n(g) category 1, (h) category 2, (i) category 3 and (j) category 1&2 substorms \n(shaded histograms). Error bars are calculated from N errors. Note that of \nthe 173 substorms in the distribution of 5a and 5f we are able to sub-categorise \n135 into categories 1, 2 and 3. Consequently the sum of the shaded probability \ndistribution in figures 5g-i does not equal the unshaded probability distribution \nin figure 5f. \n)(\n)(\n)(\n)()(\n)(\npc\ns\npc\ns\npc Fn\nFn\nFp\nFpspFsp == ,       (5.5) \n \nwhere n denotes occurrence frequency and p(s), p(Fs), and p(Fpc) are the probability of a \nsubstorm occurring independently, the probability that the magnetosphere will be at a \ngiven value of open magnetic flux given there is a substorm, and the probability that the \nmagnetosphere will be at that value of open magnetic regardless of there being a \nsubstorm or not. Figure 5.5f shows the function )( pcFsp  derived from the parent and \nall-substorm frequency distributions shown in Figure 5.5a and is repeated in panels g to \nj by the unshaded histograms. Similarly, the shaded histograms in Figures 5.5g-j show \n)( pcFsp  for the substorm categories shown in Figures 2b-e. In all cases we have used \nbins of 0.05 GWb and combined bins in which there are less than 5 events occurring. \nFor all substorms, and for category 1&2, the probability of substorm onset is negligible \nfor fluxes below ~0.3 GWb, increases almost linearly until Fpc ~0.9 GWb, and is \nundefined above 0.9 GWb, as fluxes are not observed in this study with values that \nexceed this. These results are discussed below. \n \n5.3 Discussion & Conclusions \n \n5.3.1 Are All Frey Substorm Events Substorms? \n \nIn this study we use substorm onset times derived by Frey et al. (2004) from nightside \nauroral brightenings in IMAGE FUV observations. It is well known that other \nmagnetospheric phenomena, such as pseudo-breakups (see section 2.1.6), can cause \nauroral brightenings similar to those seen at the time of substorm onset and it is not \nunlikely that a number of these may have been erroneously included in Frey\u2019s substorm \nlist. Therefore, as a secondary indicator of substorm onset we looked for energetic \nparticle injections measured by the LANL spacecraft, subdividing the substorm \ndistribution into three categories based on these signatures. We found that a significant \nnumber of substorms fall into each of the three categories, and showed that the mean of \nFpc decreases as the injection signature becomes less obvious (see Figures 5.5b-d). \n \n 77\nOne interpretation of this result is that the probability of energetic particles reaching, or \nbeing generated at, geosynchronous orbit following substorm onset decreases for \nsmaller values of Fpc.  Indeed it has been shown that substorms occurring with \ncontracted polar caps (corresponding to smaller open magnetic fluxes) are statistically \nless energetic than substorms occurring with larger auroral ovals (e.g. Akasofu, 1975; \nMilan et al., 2008). \n \nAn alternative view of these results is that category 1 events are almost certainly \nsubstorms, with category 2 including both substorm events as well as other phenomena \nwhich cause auroral brightenings such as pseudo-breakups or solar wind pressure \nenhancements (which have been shown to be associated with auroral brightenings and \nenergetic particle enhancements at geosynchronous orbit). Events falling into category 3 \nmay not be substorms or may be pseudo-breakups or very weak substorms. We further \ninvestigate the properties of these three distinct categories in the following chapter. \n \n5.3.2 What do the Distributions Tell Us About Substorm Onset? \n \nWe have shown that the occurrence distribution of Fpc in the magnetosphere varies \nbetween 0.2 and 0.9 GWb, with a mean of 0.52 GWb, in good agreement with the \nvalues found by previous studies (e.g. Milan et al., 2004, 2007, 2008). The occurrence \ndistribution of Fpc at substorm onset also varies between values consistent with previous \nstudies (Coumans et al., 2007; DeJong et al., 2007; Milan et al., 2007, Huang et \nal.,2009b) and occurs with a significantly higher mean (0.59 GWb) than the parent \ndistribution. No substorm onsets are seen to occur below a minimum of 0.3 GWb, \nshowing that the magnetosphere must be preloaded with open magnetic flux as a \nrequirement for substorm onset. If category 1 is considered to be the true substorm \ndistribution then a minimum threshold of 0.4 GWb must be reached before substorm \nonset is induced, more strongly supporting this view. \n \nFreeman and Morley (2004) developed a theoretical model in which the occurrence \ndistribution of substorm onsets, and the distribution of substorm magnitudes  \n(Morley et al., 2007), could be reproduced if substorm onset only depended on a fixed \ncritical threshold in the open magnetic flux. If this were so then we would expect the \nprobability distribution of Fpc at substorm onset to be a delta function centered on the \n 78\nthreshold value and a sharp cut-off in the parent distribution of Fpc at this value. \nHowever, Figures 5.5a-j do not show this. For all substorm categories, onset can occur \nover a range of open magnetic fluxes (confirming results found by other smaller \nstatistical studies) with the parent distribution extending over this entire range. Here we \nmust also consider whether the distributions can be consistent with a fixed threshold \nwithin measurement errors. Using the extreme example of an uncertainty in the open \nmagnetic flux of ~10%, this gives a maximum error in open magnetic flux of  \n~ 0.1 GWb, much smaller than the spread seen in our distributions. \n \nWhilst most studies agree that the preloading of the magnetosphere is required for \nsubstorm onset, others suggest that a further condition must also exist, such as a solar \nwind trigger (e.g. a northward turning of the IMF Bz) (Lyons et al., 1997; Hsu and \nMcPherron, 2002; Hsu and  McPherron, 2003). Other studies showing clear examples of \nsubstorm onsets occurring during very steady solar wind conditions (e.g. Hsu and \nMcPherron, 2003; Henderson et al., 2006) suggest that an entirely internal threshold \n(such as in open magnetic flux), whose value may be modulated by other factors such as \nthe strength of the ring current (e.g Milan et al., 2009a,b), is the only requirement of \nsubstorm onset (see also section 2.2.3). \n \nIf we assume that a solar wind trigger is required to trigger onset once some minimal \nopen magnetic flux threshold has been reached, that triggers occur uniformly randomly \nwith time, and that the open magnetic flux increases linearly (BBz <0) until a trigger \noccurs, then we would expect the probability of substorm onset as a function of open \nmagnetic flux to show a step function from zero probability of onset below the minimal \nflux threshold and a decreasing (geometric) distribution above this. This is not seen in \nour distribution. In fact we may expect the probability to decrease even faster than this \nbecause Hsu and McPherron (2002) showed that triggers are not uniformly distributed, \nsuch that the longer it has been since the last southward turning of the IMF BzB , the \nlonger the time expected until a northward turning. Thus a simple model of flux \naccumulation followed by the triggering of substorm onset by the solar wind, where the \ntriggers are either independent or distributed as found by Hsu and McPherron (2002), \ncannot explain the results presented in this thesis. \n \n 79\nMilan et al. (2009a,b) suggested that the ring current may stabilise the magnetotail to \nreconnection such that when the ring current is enhanced substorms occur at higher \nvalues of open magnetic flux (see Figure 2.8). Our results are not inconsistent with a \nvariable open magnetic flux threshold for substorm onset, whose value depends on the \nstrength of the ring current or some other magnetospheric property. \n \nIn this study we have concentrated on the relationship of substorm onset to the amount \nof open magnetic flux in the magnetosphere. However, it may be that there exists \nanother quantity for which a fixed threshold is a necessary and sufficient condition for \nsubstorm onset (e.g. the Kappa parameter (B\u00fcchner and Zelenyi, 1987)) and that the \nrelationship between this and open flux is multi-valued. That is, various configurations \nof open magnetic flux could exist for a given critical value of this quantity. What \nmagnetospheric property this quantity may be is still a matter of speculation and \nenquiry. \n \n5.4 Summary \n \nIn this chapter we have carried out the largest statistical study of the open magnetic flux \ncontent of the magnetosphere to date, and compared the average open magnetic flux \ncontent of the magnetosphere with that at the time of substorm onset. The results show \nthat, on average, substorms occur at the upper end of the average open magnetic flux \ndistribution, showing how the magnetosphere must be preloaded with open magnetic \nflux prior to substorm onset. \n \nThe large numbers of open magnetic flux estimates allow us, for the first time, to \ndetermine the probability of substorm onset as a function of open magnetic flux. The \nresults show that substorms can occur over a large range of open magnetic flux values \nand that a fixed critical threshold in open magnetic flux does not exist. The results are \nalso not consistent with a model in which a solar wind trigger is required to trigger \nonset once some minimal threshold in open magnetic flux has been reached. The results \nare, however, consistent with a model in which a variable threshold in open magnetic \nflux exists as a requirement of substorm onset. The distributions shown in Figure 5.5 \nplace important constraints on any future similar models of substorm onset. \n \n 80\nSearching for the energetic particle injection signatures of substorm onset in \ngeosynchronous satellite data, we have found that not all substorms identified in the list \nof Frey et al. (2004) show the characteristic injection signature of substorms. Dividing \nsubstorms into three categories based on their particle injection signatures, we find that \nsubstorms showing the \u2018classical\u2019 particle injection signature expected at substorm \nonset occur, on average, at higher values of open magnetic flux than those showing \nvaried particle enhancement signatures. Events showing no energetic particle \nenhancements occur at even lower values of open magnetic flux. In the following \nchapter we investigate these three distinct particle injection categories of substorms in \nmore detail by carrying out a superposed epoch analysis of the open magnetic flux, solar \nwind and IMF conditions, geomagnetic activity, auroral luminosity and auroral oval \nboundary motions during each type of event. \n 81\nChapter 6. A Superposed Epoch Analysis of Substorm \nDynamics \n \nIn the previous chapter we demonstrated that substorms showing a \u2018classic\u2019 substorm \nparticle injection signature at geosynchronous orbit (category 1) occur, on average, at \nhigher values of open magnetic flux than those showing varied activity (category 2) or \nno particle injection activity (category 3). In the first half of this chapter we investigate \nthis finding in more detail by carrying out a superposed epoch analysis of the open \nmagnetic flux, solar wind and IMF conditions, auroral luminosity and geomagnetic \nactivity around the time of substorm onset for the three distinct particle injection \ncategories. In the second half of this chapter we carry out a superposed epoch analysis \nof the latitude of the OCB, the latitude of the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval \nand the derived width of the auroral oval for all substorms and for the three distinct \nparticle injection substorm categories. \n \n6.1 Open Magnetic Flux, Auroral Intensity, IMF and Solar Wind Conditions and \nGeomagnetic Indices \n \n6.1.1 Methodology \n \nIn the previous chapter we calculated Fpc from over 12,000 auroral images from the \nDecember and January months of 2000-2002. We now use these estimates of Fpc and \nthe Frey list of substorms to perform a superposed epoch analysis of Fpc, the maximum \nnightside auroral intensity and the solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity \nwithin 5 hours from the time of substorm onset. \u00b1\n \nFirstly, we categorise all Frey substorm onsets from December and January 2000-2002 \nusing the LANL classification system as described in the previous chapter. That is, we \nsplit the onsets in to three categories based on particle injection signatures at \ngeosynchronous orbit as seen by the LANL spacecraft: \nCategory 1: Substorms showing a classic substorm particle injection signature. \nCategory 2: Those substorms exhibiting energetic particle fluctuations which do not fall \nwithin category 1 (unclear activity). \n 82\nCategory 3: Substorms which show no energetic particle fluctuations at any MLTs. \n \nThe availability of LANL data and the location of the LANL spacecraft limits our \nability to classify the substorms in this way (as described in the previous chapter). Of \nthe 451 onsets in the Frey database from December and January 2000-2002 we are able \nto classify a total of 306 onsets into the three LANL categories. We find that relatively \neven numbers of onsets lie in each of the three categories, 114 in category 1, 100 in \ncategory 2 and 92 in category 3. To produce a time-series of Fpc relative to the onset \ntime, the following procedure is used: for each LANL category and for each Frey onset \nwithin the category we find all values of Fpc from the parent distribution which fall \nwithin  5 hours of the onset time. The data are then binned in bins of 13 minutes such \nthat at the onset time values are binned from 6 minutes prior to onset to 6 minutes \nproceeding onset. The mean of all values in each 13  minute bin and across all \nsubstorms within the relevant category is then taken. A similar procedure is carried out \non the maximum nightside auroral intensity, solar wind magnetic field and plasma \nproperties and the geomagnetic indices AL, AU and SYM-H. \n\u00b1\n \nThe maximum nightside auroral intensity is taken to be the maximum count rate found \nbetween 18-06 MLT and 50-90\u00b0 magnetic latitude from each IMAGE WIC FUV \nauroral image. Any counts found above a value of 4000 are considered to be due to \nanomalies in the data, that is we set a maximum limit of 4000 counts. Solar wind data \nare provided by the OMNI Definitive, 1 AU 1 minute IMF and Plasma database \ncourtesy of CDAWeb. Plasma and magnetic field data from the ACE, WIND and \nGeotail spacecraft were used to produce averaged 1 minute resolution plasma and IMF \ndatasets shifted to the Earth\u2019s bow shock nose using a minimal variance technique  \n(see Weimer et al., 2003). All solar wind data used in this thesis are in GSM coordinates \n(see Figure 1.2). One minute resolution AL, AU and SYM-H indices were provided \ncourtesy of the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto University, from a chain \nof high latitude magnetometers. \n \nThe Akasofu epsilon parameter is an empirically determined fraction of the solar wind \nPoynting flux through the dayside magnetopause (Perreault & Akasofu, 1978) and is \nthus a measure of the solar wind energy input into the magnetosphere due to dayside \nreconnection. Here we define the epsilon parameter as: \n 83\n )2\/(sin 42 cx BV \u03b8\u03b5 = ,        (6.1) \n \nwhere B is the total IMF strength ( )( 222 zyx BBBB ++= ), Vx is the x component of the \nsolar wind flow speed and \u03b8c is the IMF clock angle (see Figure 1.2). This has the same \nfunctional form as equations derived for the dayside reconnection rate  \n(e.g. Milan et al., 2007; Milan et al., 2008) and thus its magnitude also gives an \nindication of the level of dayside reconnection. Here we have left out the length \nconstant, l0, so that \u03b5 has units of power per unit area. \n \nFigure 6.1 shows the superposed epoch traces for the three LANL categories. Category \n1 events are shown by the green trace, category 2 by the red and category 3 by the blue. \nAlso overplotted in each panel is a null line (grey) representing the average conditions \nand variations for the whole period of study not keyed to substorm onset. This is \ncalculated by combining the onset times from all three categories, adding one IMAGE \norbit period (14.2 hrs) to each onset time and carrying out the same superposed epoch \nmethodology to find Fpc and the solar wind and magnetic indices within 5 hrs of this \nshifted time. Shifting the onset times by one IMAGE orbit means that no biases will be \nintroduced by the viewing angle of the WIC detector as this will remain consistent \nbetween the LANL categories and null line. Progressing through each panel, a-n, in turn \nwe have the superposed traces for (a) F\n\u00b1\npc, (b) the maximum nightside auroral intensity \n(I), (c) the IMF BBz component in nT, (d) the transverse component of the IMF \n( )( 22 zyt BBB += ), (e) IMF ByB , (f) the absolute value of BBy, (g) IMF BxB , (h) the absolute \nvalue of BBx, (i) the solar wind proton number density (Nsw), (j) the solar wind flow \npressure (P), (k) the x component of the solar wind flow speed (Vx), (l) the SYM-H \nindex, (m) the Akasofu parameter (\u03b5) given by equation 6.1, and finally (n) the AU and \nAL indices. \n \nTo give us a better understanding of the significance of any fluctuations in the \nsuperposed traces we also plot the LANL categories separately in Figures 6.2-6.4, along \nwith a null line (grey line) representing the average conditions.

To give some indication of the statistical significance of the superposed \nresults, we also plot the standard error on the mean for all parameters, shown by the \ngrey shaded region. Repeating all plots using the medians in the binning process does \nnot effect any of the curves significantly. \n \n6.1.2 Observations and Discussion \n \n6.1.2.1 Overview of Category 1 and 2 Events \n \nInitial inspection of Figure 6.1 shows that the fluctuations seen in category 1 and 2 \nevents occur with relatively similar magnitudes and show similar trends in many of the \nparameters whilst category 3 events tend to occur with much weaker fluctuations. We \ntherefore firstly summarise the variations and trends seen in category 1 and 2 events, \ntaking each parameter in turn, before discussing the very different category 3 events in \nthe next section. \n \nPanel a: Open Magnetic Flux \n \nIn the previous chapter we showed that category 1 events occur, on average, at higher \nvalues of Fpc than either category 2 or category 3 events. This is confirmed in the \nsuperposed plot, green line Figure 6.1a and 6.2a, with Fpc reaching its highest value for \nthe whole \u00b1 5 hours at the onset time (from hereafter referred to as t = 0) with a value of \n~ 0.64 GWb. Fpc remains relatively unchanged between ~ -3.5 hrs and ~ -60 minutes, \nfluctuating between ~ 0.52 and 0.54 GWb. At ~ -60 minutes Fpc begins to rise sharply \naway from the null line from a value of ~ 0.53 GWb to 0.64 GWb at t = 0, an increase \nof 21%. Following onset Fpc rapidly falls, decreasing to a value of 0.51 GWb at  \n+78 minutes, a drop of ~ 20%. Fpc then continues to fluctuate between ~ 0.48 and  \n0.54 GWb for the remainder of the period. \n \nThe variation of Fpc for category 2 events is shown by the red trace of Figures 6.1a and \n6.3a. Although Fpc starts to increase at ~ -2 hours, we take the beginning of the growth \nphase to be were a sharp increase is seen in the Fpc accumulation rate at \u201391 minutes. \nThis growth phase is approximately 30 minutes longer than the growth phase seen for \ncategory 1 events and increases Fpc from a value of ~ 0.50 GWb to a value of 0.61 GWb \n 85\nat t = 0, an increase of 22%. The expansion phase is much less pronounced but more \nprolonged than for category 1. Lasting for approximately 90 minutes and reducing Fpc \nby ~ 0.045 GWb. That is, Fpc decreases by only ~ 7% in the expansion phase. Following \nthe end of the expansion phase Fpc continues to fluctuate between 0.55 and 0.6 GWb for \nthe remainder of the period, comfortably above the null line flux, which has a mean of \n0.51 GWb, and Fpc prior to substorm onset. The fluctuations are comparable in size to \nthe fluctuations seen in the null lines and we thus consider them to be insignificant. \n \nThe values of Fpc for both category 1 and 2 events are consistent with the values found \nby previous studies (e.g. Coumans et al., 2007; DeJong et al., 2007; Milan et al., 2007; \nHuang et al., 2009). Previous studies (e.g. DeJong et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009) have \nfound a reduction of between 24-30% of the total open magnetic flux stored in the \nsystem during the expansion phase of isolated and sawtooth substorm events. Category \n1 events show a similar reduction in the total Fpc content of the system (20%), whilst \ncategory 2 events do not (7%). Panel m of Figure 6.1 shows the superposed Akasofu \u03b5 \nparameter (equation 6.1), a measure of the dayside driving, for the three categories. \nCategory 1 \u03b5 decreases rapidly around the onset time, suggesting that the addition of \nenergy to the magnetosphere through dayside reconnection, and the addition of open \nmagnetic flux to the system, slows dramatically. Coupled with the large flux closure due \nto substorm onset on the nightside, this results in a large reduction of the total flux of \nthe system for this category. For category 2, \u03b5 (red trace) remains elevated after onset as \ncompared to category 1 events (green trace), suggesting that dayside reconnection and \nthe addition of open magnetic flux to the system continues at a steady rate throughout \nthe substorm expansion phase for category 2 events, balancing the ongoing closure of \nflux on the nightside (see also I below). This results in only a moderate reduction of the \ntotal flux of the system for this category. \n \nPanel b: Auroral Intensity \n \nThe green trace in panel b Figures 6.1 and 6.2 shows the superposed maximum \nnightside auroral intensity (I), in counts, for category 1 events. Between -5 hrs and  \n-13 minutes the intensity fluctuations are small and of a similar size to the random \nfluctuations seen in the null lines. At -13 minutes the intensity sharply increases, at a \nrate of ~ 52 counts\/min, from a value of ~1890 to a peak of ~ 3051 counts at  \n 86\n+13 minutes. Following the peak I falls at a rate of 11 counts\/min until ~ +2 hours, \nwhere after it fluctuates around the null line at a fairly constant intensity for the \nremainder of the period. \n \nThe intensity of category 2 events (red trace Figure 6.1b and 6.3b) fluctuates at similar \nvalues to that of the category 1 intensity and the null lines from -5 hrs to -13 minutes. At \n-13 minutes the intensity rapidly rises at a rate of ~ 32 counts\/min. As with category 1 \nevents, the peak in intensity is reached at +13 minutes with a value of 2800 counts. \nThereafter, similarly to Fpc (Figure 6.1a), the intensity shows a slow decline lasting for \n~ 30 minutes longer than the decline of I for category 1 events. Also similarly to Fpc, for \nthe remainder of the period I remains elevated as compared to the category 1 intensity \nand the null lines. The values found in this study are somewhat lower in intensity than \nthose found by Mende et al. (2003) at the MLT of the initial onset. The higher \nbackground levels in our study suggest that the brightest part of the auroral oval is not \nnecessarily at the onset MLT prior to substorm onset. The more extreme peak values of \nthe Mende study may be explained by the increased intensity of the aurora in summer \nmonths, not used in this study. \n \nBlockx et al. (2009) found a very good correlation between the maximum nightside \nauroral intensity during the substorm process and the \u03b5 parameter, a measure of the \ndayside reconnection rate. They found that the maximum nightside auroral intensity \nintegrated over the expansion phase is better correlated with the \u03b5 parameter integrated \nover the growth phase (r=0.9) than \u03b5 integrated over the expansion phase (r=0.6), \nsuggesting that the loading-unloading process (in which energy is first stored in the \nmagnetosphere during the growth phase and subsequently released during substorm \nexpansion) plays a bigger role in the substorm onset than the directly driven process \n(where solar wind energy is directly dissipated into the ionosphere and ring current). \nMilan et al. (2006) carried out a multi-instrument study of a substorm interval occurring \nduring a period of continued southward IMF and hence inferred continuous dayside \ndriving. They found that following the second substorm event of their study Fpc \nremained elevated for the remainder of the substorm interval and that the maximum \nauroral intensity averaged between 20:00 and 04:00 MLT, after showing a rapid \nbrightening around the onset time, slowly declined over the next 2.5 hours. \nMeasurements of the magnetic field in the magnetotail made by the Cluster  \n 87\n(Escoubet et al., 1997, 2001) and Double Star (Liu et al., 2005) spacecraft suggested \nthat the tail dynamics during the substorm is strongly driven by the on-going dayside \ncreation of open magnetic flux. We suggest that category 2 events are similar to the \nevent of this study in that they are highly influenced by the continued dayside solar \nwind-magnetosphere driving, and that there is a larger contribution in their driving from \nthe directly driven process whilst category 1 events depend more heavily on the \nloading-unloading process. \n \nPanels c-k and m: IMF and Solar Wind Conditions \n \nThe green trace in panels c-h of Figure 6.1 and 6.2 show the superposed IMF data for \ncategory 1 events. BBz fluctuates between ~ -0.3 and -0.9 nT from -5 hrs to -130 minutes. \nThis is followed by a rapid and large increase to more negative values, -3.2 nT being \nreached at -26 minutes. The decrease of BzB  slightly increases at -78 minutes from  \n~ 0.017 nT\/min between -130 and -78 minutes to 0.033 nT\/min between -78 and  \n-26 minutes. Over the next 40 minutes BBz turns sharply towards less negative values, a \nvalue of -0.8 nT reached at ~ +1 hr. For the remainder of the 5 hr study the BzB  \ncomponent slowly progresses towards less negative values but is always more negative \nthan the null lines. The \u03b5 parameter (panels m) closely anti-correlates with the variation \nof the BBz component of the IMF. Between -5 hrs and -130 minutes \u03b5 varies between \napproximately 5.5 and 8.6 W\/m, before rapidly increasing in conjunction with the large \nnegative excursion of BzB . \u03b5 reaches its maximum value of ~ 11.2 W\/m at -26 minutes, \nthe same time as BBz reaches its most negative value. Subsequently \u03b5 drops rapidly until \n+91 minutes following the rapid return of BzB  to less negative values. Thereafter \u03b5 slowly \ndeclines as BBz slowly moves towards less negative values for the remainder of the \nperiod. The close anti correlation between the IMF BzB  and \u03b5 variations suggests that BBz \nplays the dominant role in the driving of dayside reconnection for category 1 events. \n \nThe category 1 BBt, BxB  and absolute values of BBx and ByB  (panels d, g, h and f) show no \ndeviation from the typical non-substorm IMF behaviour as represented by the null lines. \nThe category 1 BBy component (panels e) is mildly positive and fluctuates with a slightly \nhigher mean, 3.0=\u03bc  nT, than its null line, 1.0=\u03bc  nT. The size of the fluctuations \nseen in the category 1 By B trace are of a similar size to the fluctuations seen in the \n 88\ncategory 1 null line (grey line Figure 6.2e), suggesting that these fluctuations are not \nsignificant. \n \nBoth the category 1 solar wind proton density (Figure 6.1i and 6.2i) and pressure \n(panels j) have a slightly higher mean than their average values as represented by the \nnull lines, the mean values being 0.7\n1\n\u2248\nCatSW\nN  cm-3, 0.6\n1\n\u2248\nNullCatSW\nN  cm-3,  \n6.21 =CatP  nPa, 3.21 \u2248nullCatP  nPa. The category 1 solar wind velocity, Vx, (panels k) is \nalso slightly higher than its equivalent null line, 451\n1\n\u2212\u2248\nCatx\nV  km s-1,  \n444\n1\n\u2212\u2248\nnullCatx\nV  km s-1. \n \nThe category 2 IMF data are shown by the red lines of Figures 6.1c-h and 6.3c-h. \nBetween -5 and -3.5 hrs the BBz component of the field varies around values similar to \nthe category 1 events and the null line before moving to slightly positive values between \n~ -3 and ~ -2 hours. The negative magnitude of BzB  then starts to increase at the same \ntime as the excursion seen in the category 1 events, with the rate of change rapidly \nincreasing at -78 minutes to a rate of ~ 0.02 nT\/min. The most negative value of ~ -2 nT \nis reached at -13 minutes, approximately ten minutes later than for category 1 events. \nThe recovery towards less negative magnitudes occurs much less rapidly than for \ncategory 1 events over the subsequent 3 hours, thereafter BBz slowly progresses towards \nless negative values and the null line for the remainder of the period. \n \nThe category 2 transverse component of the field (BBt) is elevated from the null line and \ncategory 1 events by ~ 1 nT, the K-S statistical test returns a probability of 0.98 that the \ndistribution of BtB  for category 2 events is significantly different to that of category 1 \nevents and the null line. The K-S test returns a probability of 0.2 that the category 1 B Bt \ndistribution is significantly different to its null line, suggesting that category 1 events \noccur during average solar wind BtB  conditions. The category 2 BBy component fluctuates \nat similar values to the category 1 events, whilst the absolute value suggests that the \ncategory 2 events occur with elevated magnitudes of IMF ByB . Figure 6.5 shows the \ndistributions of BBy and the absolute value of By B averaged over the half hour prior to onset \nfor the three LANL categories. Several large magnitude BBy events (> \u00b110 nT) are seen \nin the category 2 distribution.

However, the \u03b5 parameter is a function of the solar \nwind flow speed, Vx, the total IMF strength, , and the IMF clock \nangle. Both V\n2\/1222 )( zyx BBBB ++=\nx and BBz are stronger for category 1 events, whilst ByB  and BBx are elevated \nfor category 2. While the driving for category 1 events appears to be largely governed \nby the BzB  component of the field, the elevated driving for category 2 events appears to \noriginate from the elevated magnitudes of the BBy component of the field. \n \nPanels l-n: Magnetic Indices \n \nThe category 1 superposed SYM-H, AU and AL indices are shown by the green lines in \nFigures 6.1 and 6.2 panels l and n respectively. The SYM-H index gradually increases \nin negative magnitude from ~ -18 nT at -5 hours to ~ -19.6 nT at ~ -1 hrs. From ~ -1 hrs \nto T=0 SYM-H increases more quickly to a minimum of -22 nT at T=0. Immediately \nfollowing T=0 SYM-H begins to recover, recovering to ~ -19 nT at +91 minutes. For \nthe entire period of study category 1 SYM-H has a greater magnitude than the null lines. \nThe category 2 SYM-H index occurs at slightly reduced levels compared to category 1 \nand steadily increases between -14 and -20 nT over the 10 hrs of study. This is \nconsistent with the continued enhancement of the ring current throughout the expansion \n 90\nphase of these events due to the continued dayside reconnection. The enhancement of \nthe SYM-H index (a measure of the ring current) for substorm events with larger values \nof Fpc is consistent with results of previous superposed studies (Milan et al., 2008, \n2009a, b; Huang et al., 2009). \n \nCategory 1 AL and AU indices show the expected bays associated with the onset of \nsubstorms. As for SYM-H, both AL and AU values are enhanced as compared to the \nnull lines. The peak in AL and AU magnetic bays for category 2 events is slightly \nsmaller than that seen for category 1 events. The magnetic bays suggest the onset of \nsubstorms, but as with Fpc, the intensity and the IMF BBz, the recovery occurs more \ngradually over ~ 3 hours. \n \nThe peak in category 1 AL and AU activity is reached at +26 minutes, consistent with \nthe findings of Weimer et al. (1994). Category 2 activity reaches a peak at  \n~ +52 minutes, somewhat later than the times suggested by the Weimer study. \nHowever, the magnitudes of the AL and AU indices are on average much smaller than \nthose seen in the Weimer study and are consistent with the result that the greater the \nmagnitude of the substorm bay the quicker the peak in activity is reached. \n \nSubstorm periodicity \n \nInitial inspection of the category 1 superposed Fpc suggests that Fpc may reach a \nsignificant peak at both ~ \u00b15 hours, suggesting a possible substorm periodicity of  \n5 hours for these events. A second peak in the superposed Fpc trace of category 2 events \nis seen at ~ -3 hours, with Fpc rising and falling by ~0.09 GWb between -5 and  \n~ -2.1 hours. Small secondary peaks are also seen following onset, although these are of \na similar size to the fluctuations seen in the null line. Borovsky et al. (1993) studied the \naverage time interval between substorms (\u0394t) for every pair of consecutive substorms \nidentified from energetic particle enhancements at geosynchronous orbit by the LANL \nspacecraft from the 1st of October 1982 to the 29th of September 1983. 1001 values of \u0394t \nwere used. They found an average waiting time between substorms occurring cyclically \n(e.g. sawtooth events) of ~ 2.75 hours and a \u0394t of ~ 5 hours for substorms occurring \nrandomly (outside of cyclic periods). This leads to the question of whether category 1 \nevents are isolated random substorm events occurring with a mean periodicity of  \n 91\n~ 5 hours, similar to the mean time found between \u2018random\u2019 substorms by Borovsky et \nal. (1993), and whether category 2 events are periodic substorms occurring with the \naverage substorm periodicity of ~ 2.75 hours. To investigate this further we searched \nthrough the Frey database of onsets for all substorms occurring within the \u00b1 5 hour \nperiod of the superposed study. We find that there is little difference between the \nnumber of substorms occurring within this time period for category 1 and 2 events. In \nfact only 50% of the substorms in either category 1 or 2 have another substorm within \n+5 hours or -5 hours. For category 3 events (see below) this number is reduced to  \n~ 36%, which may be expected due to the lower general activity seen for category 3 \nevents. This also suggests that category 3 events are not largely made up of pseudo-\nbreakups or very weak substorms occurring in the growth or expansion phases of larger \nevents. We conclude that there is no difference in the substorm periodicity for category \n1 and 2 events. We may also draw the conclusion that sawtooth events (approximately 3 \nhourly substorm events defined by the nature of their particle injection signatures) do \nnot determine the properties of either category 1 or 2 events. The secondary peak in the \ncategory 2 superposed plot is due to a small number of very large onsets occurring at \nthis time. \n \nSubstorm Triggering \n \nThe large northward turning of the IMF BBz component (green trace Figure 6.1a and \n6.2a) in the half hour preceding substorm onset for category 1 events may lead some \nobservers to suggest that these events could be triggered by a northward turning of the \nIMF. With only a small rise in BzB  seen for category 2 events, conversely observers may \nalso suggest that most category 2 events are non-triggered events. Morley and Freeman \n(2007) developed an automated technique to identify northward triggers using the \nquantitative rules defined by Lyons et al. (1997) (see Morley and Freeman (2007) for \nthe list of criteria used in identifying a northward turning). We used this automated \ntechnique to identify northward turnings occurring within the 50 minutes prior to the \nonset time, finding that 72% of category 1, 54% of category 2 events and 41% of \ncategory 3 events are associated with a northward turning. For a time window of  \n30 minutes prior to onset 57% of category 1, 40% of category 2 events and 33% of \ncategory 3 events are associated with a northward turning. For a time window of  \n15 minutes before onset (as used by Lyons et al. (1997) in their definition of a \n 92\nnorthward trigger) 44% of category 1, 29% of category 2 and 17% of category 3 events \nare associated with a northward turning. It is clear that category 1 events do not have \nexclusivity on northward triggering events and it is more likely that the increased \nnumber of \u2018triggered\u2019 events in this category and the large northward turning seen in the \nsuperposed trace is a consequence of the form of the growth phase and the dayside \ndriving for these events rather than a real association between northward turning \ntriggered events and energetic particle injections. Moreover, Coumans et al. (2007) \nsuggested that northward triggered events occur at lower values of Fpc than non-\ntriggered events such that if category 1 events were triggered by the solar wind they \nwould occur at lower values of Fpc than category 2, which is the opposite of what is \nseen in the present study. \n \n6.1.2.2 Summary and Discussion of Category 3 Events \n \nIn the previous chapter we showed that category 3 events occur, on average, at lower \nvalues of Fpc than either category 1 or 2 events. This is confirmed in the superposed \nstudy, blue trace Figure 6.1a and 6.4a, with an Fpc at onset of 0.49 GWb. This value is \nbelow the null line value of Fpc at onset and the mean value of the category 3 null line \nflux (grey trace Figure 6.4), 0.51 GWb. This value is also somewhat lower than the \naverage value of the onset Fpc found in previous studies (e.g. Coumans et al., 2007; \nDeJong et al., 2007; Milan et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2009). Fpc rises from a value of  \n~ 0.43 GWb at -169 minutes to a peak of ~0.51 GWb reached at +39 minutes. \nApproximately 0.05 GWb of flux is then closed over the next 50 minutes. For the \nmajority of the 10 hour period Fpc is located below the average Fpc represented by the \nnull lines, which is the opposite to what is expected for substorms. The maximum \nnightside auroral intensity of category 3 events, blue trace Figures 6.1b and 6.4b, is also \nlocated below the average intensity of the null line for the entirety of the 10 hours \nexcept for a short period of ~ 1 hour starting around the onset time. This is evidently the \nauroral brightening identified by Frey et al. (2004) as the start of substorm onset. The \nIMF BBz component, blue Figures 6.1c and 6.4c, is also found at smaller magnitudes than \nthe average Bz B for the majority of the \u00b15 hours. There is no large southward turning of \nBBz which would normally lead to a substorm growth phase. The Category 3 BtB , blue \ntrace Figures 6.1d and 6.4d, and the absolute BBy, Figures 6.1f and 6.4f, components of \nthe field are also found at smaller magnitudes than the null lines. \n 93\n The BBy component, blue trace Figure 6.1e and 6.4e, is shifted towards negative values, \nfluctuating between -1.6 and -0.8 nT for the entire period. To investigate this apparent \nshift further, we plot the distributions of ByB  averaged over the half hour before onset for \nthe three LANL categories in panels a,c and e of Figure 6.5. It is quite clear from the \nfigure that both category 1 and 2 distributions are fairly symmetric around 0 nT, as one \nwould expect in the average solar wind, with means of ~ 0.67 and 0.18 nT respectively. \nHowever, the category 3 distribution is skewed towards negative values of BBy with a \nmean of -1.34 nT. Figure 6.6 shows the distributions of ByB  for each of the five months \nused in this study. The distributions for December 2000, December 2002 and January \n2001 are fairly symmetric around 0 nT, with slightly positive means. December 2001 \nhas a slightly negative shift while January 2002 exhibits a large peak at ~ -5 nT, shifting \nthe mean towards a larger negative value. Category 1 events are fairly evenly spread \nthroughout these months. 54% of category 2 events occur in the negatively shifted \nmonths of December 2001 and January 2002, with 26% (30 events) falling within the \nlargely negative January 2002. In comparison, 59% of category 3 events are found in \nthese months with 38% (35 events) falling within January 2002. Removing all January \n2002 onsets from the superposed study has no significant effect on the trends and \nvariations seen in any of the panels of Figures 6.1-6.4 for any of the three categories, \nwith the negative magnitude of category 3 events reduced to a mean value -0.52 nT \nfrom -1.19 nT previously. We also note that the mean of the category 3 null line  \n(-0.77 nT) is much more negative than the mean of either category 1 (0.07 nT) or \ncategory 2 (-0.05 nT). That is, the negative shift in BBy for category 3 substorms is due to \na bias in IMF orientation during parts of our study interval and not a characteristic of \nsubstorm events showing no particle injection signatures. \n \nPrevious studies have shown that substorm onsets most often occur in the pre midnight \nsector of the auroral oval in the northern hemisphere but that the onset location shifts \ntowards dawn for events occurring during periods of more negative IMF BBy  \n(e.g. Gerard et al., 2004; Liou et al., 2001b). To investigate whether our results are \nconsistent with this result, we plot the distribution of onset MLTs (the MLT of the \nauroral brightening identified by Frey et al. (2004) by visual inspection of IMAGE FUV \nauroral images) for the three categories in Figure 6.7. Both category 1 and 2 \ndistributions (green and red respectively) are very similar, both having a mean of  \n 94\n  \nJanuary 2001 \n \nDecember 2000 \nMean = 0.33 \nMedian = 0.84 \nMean = 0.13 \nMedian = 0.33 \n \nJanuary 2002 \n \n \nDecember 2000 \nMean = -0.61 \nMedian = -1.01 \nMean = -1.12 \nMedian = -2.18 \nDecember 2002 \n \nMean = 0.14 \nMedian = 0.13 \nFigure 6.6: Distributions of IMF BBy for the 5 months used in this study. \nDistributions are produced from all 1 minute resolution values (provided by the \nOMNI Definitive, 1 AU 1 minute IMF and Plasma database, courtesy of CDAWeb) \nfrom each day of the relevant month. \n Figure 6.7: Distribution of onset MLTs for category 1 (green), category 2 \n(red) and category 3 (blue) substorm events. \n~ 23.1 MLT, consistent with the average onset location found in previous studies. \nApplying the K-S statistical test to the two distributions returns a probability of 0.98 \nthat the two distributions are the same. Category 3 events are shifted towards more \npositive MLTs, although this is not largely reflected in the mean, with a mean of  \n23.5 MLT. The K-S test returns a probability that category 3 events are the same as \ncategory 1 or 2 of less than 0.06. This result is consistent with the shifting of onset \nMLTs toward dawn for substorms occurring with more negative IMF ByB . However, it \nalso suggests that category 3 events are not the same as category 1 and 2. That is, they \nmay be a different type of process. \n \nThe category 3 BBx component, blue Figures 6.1g and 6.4g, is found at slightly more \npositive values than the null line, as would be expected to accompany the negative ByB  \nshift due to anti correlation between BBx and ByB  in the Parker spiral. The category 3 solar \nwind proton density, pressure and flow speed are all significantly reduced compared to \ncategory 1 and 2 events and the average null lines. \n \nThe category 3 SYM-H, AL and AU indices (blue Figures 6.1n and 6.4n) are much \nreduced compared to category 1 and 2 events, suggesting that category 3 events occur \nduring quiet geomagnetic conditions. The AL and AU indices both show slight \ndeviations at the onset time suggesting that very small geomagnetic disturbances are \noccurring. \n \nPrevious studies have shown that very weak substorms and pseudo-breakups occur with \nvery weak IMF BBz, solar wind proton density and pressure (e.g. Kullen and Karlsson, \n2004) and show very weak magnetic activity (see McPherron et al., 2008 and references \ntherein). The results of this study suggest that category 3 may contain both very weak \nsubstorms as well as other events which may cause nightside auroral brightenings such \nas pseudo-breakups (however, as discussed above, they are not dominated by pseudo-\nbreakups occurring during the growth phase of substorms). \n \n6.2 Auroral Boundaries \n \nThe OCB in the ionosphere marks the transition from magnetic field lines with an open \ntopology to a closed topology and hence represents the mapped location of the dayside \n 95\nand nightside reconnection sites. Tracking changes in the latitude of the OCB thus gives \nimportant insights into the reconnection process. The equatorward boundary of the \nelectron auroral oval has been shown to be co-located with inner edge of the plasma \nsheet (e.g. Eather and Mende, 1972). Tracking latitudinal changes in the equatorward \nboundary of the auroral oval is therefore an important diagnostic tool for the state of the \nmagnetosphere. \n \nIn the classic definition of a substorm (see section 2.1 of this thesis) the aurora drift \nequatorward in the growth phase of the substorm before rapidly expanding poleward \nduring the expansion phase. Ground and space-based auroral imagery have confirmed \nthis general motion of the aurora during substorms, but have also shown that this \naverage behaviour is highly variable and dynamic. For example, the aurora may remain \nat a relatively constant latitude when open magnetic flux continues to be added to the \npolar cap during the expansion phase. Other studies have shown that the motion of the \npoleward and equatorward boundary of the auroral oval is not concurrent at all MLTs \n(e.g. Jayachandran et al., 2005; Coumans et al., 2007). To date few and limited \nstatistical studies of the poleward and equatorward motion of auroral boundaries during \nsubstorms have been carried out. By far the most extensive of these was carried out by \nMende et al. (2003); this study is summarised below and in Figures 6.8 and 6.9. \n \nUsing both WIC and SI12 observations of the auroral oval Mende et al. (2003) carried \nout a superposed epoch analysis of the poleward (top set of traces Figure 6.8) and \nequatorward (bottom set of traces Figure 6.8) auroral boundary motions at the onset \nMLT (RMLT = 0; black line Figure 6.8) and at \u00b12 (\u00b12 RMLT; yellow and green lines \nFigure 6.8) and \u00b14 MLT (\u00b14 RMLT; red and blue lines Figure 6.8) from the onset MLT. \nHere we have introduced the notation RMLT to denote the MLT at which the boundary \nmotion takes place relative to the MLT of the initial auroral brightening, determined \nfrom the location of the initial auroral brightening in the IMAGE data. Their data set \nconsisted of 112 substorm onsets from the time period 23 June 2000 to 14 May 2001. \nTheir results show that prior to substorm onset the poleward boundary moves slowly \nequatorward by ~1-2\u00b0 in all MLT sectors. At onset (t=0) the poleward boundary moves \nrapidly to higher latitudes. At RMLT=0 (black line top set of traces Figure 6.8) the \nresponse of the poleward boundary to onset is rapid and large, the poleward motion \nappearing to start ~4-5 minutes before onset, and moving rapidly poleward by ~ 4-5\u00b0 \n 96\n Figure 6.8: The latitude of the poleward (top set of traces) and equatorward \n(bottom set of traces) boundaries of the WIC auroral oval from approximately 30 \nminutes prior to substorm onset to 120 minutes after, at the MLT of the initial \nauroral onset (black line) and at -2 (yellow), +2 (green), -4 (red) and +4 (blue) \nMLTs from this location, from a study of 91 substorms by Mende et al., 2003. \nFigure 6.9: The variation in the width of the auroral oval at the onset MLT of the initial \nauroral brightening (0) and at -2, +2, -4 and +4 MLTs from this location from a study of 92 \nsubstorms by Mende        (2003). The solid lines show the width as calculated from \nboundary estimations of the WIC (electron) auroral oval (see Figure 6.8) and dashed lines \nfrom boundary estimations of the SI12 (proton) auroral oval.\n \net al.,\nuntil ~ 10-15 minutes after the onset. The boundary then drifts poleward by ~ 1\u00b0 over \nthe next hour. At both \u00b12 RMLT the poleward motion begins immediately at t=0. The \npoleward motion is less rapid for both MLT sectors, with an expansion of ~ 5\u00b0 over  \n~ 30 minutes seen at +2 RMLT (green line top set of traces Figure 6.8) and a more \nsluggish motion of 3-4\u00b0 over ~ 50 minutes for -2 RMLT (yellow line top set of traces). \nThe response to onset at +4 RMLT (blue line top set of traces Figure 6.8) is slow but \nthere is still a poleward motion of up to 4\u00b0 over the first hour from onset. At -4 RMLT \n(red line top set of traces Figure 6.8) the response seen is minimal, with a poleward \nmotion of ~ 2\u00b0 over the first hour and a delay of ~5-10 minutes seen between t=0 and \nthe start of the poleward motion. \n \nThe equatorward boundary\u2019s response to onset was found to be much less pronounced \nthan the poleward boundary and to show a very similar motion at all MLTs. As \nexpected, the equatorward boundary was found to slowly drift to lower latitudes in the \ngrowth phase, this equatorward motion continuing for several minutes after onset, a \ndelay of ~5 minutes at RMLT=0 (black line bottom set of traces Figure 6.8), 10-15 \nminutes at \u00b12 RMLT and 20-30 minutes at \u00b14 RMLT. The equatorward boundary is \nfound at slightly higher latitudes (up to ~ 3-4\u00b0) at premidnight MLTs (-4 and -2 RMLT; \nred and yellow lines respectively bottom set of traces Figure 6.8) than in the dawnward \nsector (+4 and +2 MLT; blue and green lines respectively bottom set of traces Figure \n6.8). The authors suggest that this may be explained by the symmetry of the auroral \noval. If the auroral oval is located at its lowest latitude at midnight (00 MLT), and as \nmost onsets occur between 22-23 MLT, the lowest boundaries should be found at  \n~ +2 MLT, with +4 MLT boundaries at approximately the same latitude as the onset \nMLT. Boundaries at both -2 and -4 MLTs will be found at higher latitudes, as is seen in \ntheir study. \n \nThe response of the auroral oval width to these boundary motions is shown in Figure \n6.9. In response to the motions of the poleward and equatorward boundaries, a slight \nnarrowing of the auroral oval width during the growth phase is seen in most MLT \nsectors. In the first 5-10 minutes following onset a rapid thickening of ~5\u00b0 is seen at \nRMLT=0 followed by a further thickening of ~1\u00b0 over the next 30 minutes. At  \n+2 RMLT a rapid thickening of ~3.5\u00b0 is seen in the first 10 minutes after onset, followed \nby a thickening of ~2\u00b0 over the next half hour. At -2 RMLT the response is less \n 97\npronounced, with a rapid thickening of ~2\u00b0 seen in the first 5-10 minutes followed by a \nfurther thickening of ~1\u00b0 in the next half hour. The response at \u00b14 RMLT is much more \ngradual with a total widening of ~4\u00b0 over the 50 minutes proceeding onset for +4 RMLT \nand a smaller widening of ~2\u00b0 over 30 minutes for -4 RMLT. Following the oval \nwidening, the oval then remains at approximately the same width for the remainder of \ntheir time window (up to 120 minutes after onset) for all MLT sectors. \n \nIn summary, this study has shown that both the OCB and equatorward boundary of the \nauroral oval near the MLT of substorm onset slowly drift equatorward during the \ngrowth phase before rapidly expanding poleward after substorm onset but that these \nmotions are variable depending upon the specific MLT from onset. In general, the \nboundary motions after substorm onset are reduced and slower to respond the further \nfrom the onset MLT. The motion of the OCB is much more pronounced than that the \nequatorward boundary. \n \nIn this study we firstly carry out the largest superposed epoch analysis to date of the \nmotion through the substorm process of the OCB, equatorward auroral boundary and \nauroral oval width as seen by the WIC detector from all substorms identified in the \nDecember and January months of 2000-2002 by Frey et al. (2004), a total of 451 events. \nWe then divide the study into the three distinct LANL particle injection categories, \ngiving us new insights into these different types of events including their global extent. \n \n6.2.1 Methodology \n \nUsing the technique described in chapter 4 of this thesis, we have identified the location \nof the OCB at 24 separate MLT sectors around the auroral oval from over 12000 auroral \nimages taken by the IMAGE WIC detector in the months of December 2000 and \nDecember and January of 2001-2002. The location of the equatorward boundary (\u03bbEq) of \nthe auroral oval has similarly been determined. The equatorward boundary is assumed \nto be displaced by one FWHM equatorward of the center of the Gaussian fit to the \nintensity-latitude profiles across 1 hour MLT sectors of the auroral oval from 50-90\u00b0 \nmagnetic latitude. That is: \n \n 98\n\u03bb\u03bb \u0394\u2212= 1AEq  ,         (6.2) \n \nwhere A1 is the latitude of the peak of the Gaussian and \u0394\u03bb is the Gaussian FWHM. We \ndo not search for the most poleward Gaussian fit, as described in chapter 4 for the OCB. \nThe fit is made over the entire 50-90\u00b0 latitude range and if the first fit does not meet the \ncriteria 1-5 of section 4.1.2 of this thesis then we do not make a boundary estimation. \nBy visual inspection of the auroral images, we determine that this method gives a good \nestimation of latitude of the WIC equatorward boundary on the nightside auroral oval \n(18-06 MLT). We are unable to estimate the location of the equatorward boundary on \nthe dayside due to dayglow causing errors in the fitting procedure (as described in \nsection 4.2.2 of this thesis). It is important to note that a DMSP correction is not applied \nto the equatorward boundaries. For a comparison of the latitude of the auroral image \nequatorward boundary and DMSP equatorward boundary see Carbary et al. (2003). A \nsimilar study is beyond the scope of this work. The superposed epoch analysis of the \nboundaries is carried out in the same manner as for Fpc and solar wind described above, \nwith boundaries averaged in bins of 13 minutes. The width of the auroral oval is also \ndetermined from the individual OCB and equatorward boundary proxies and binned in \n13 minute bins. \n \n6.2.2 Superposed Study of All Substorms \n \nFigure 6.10 shows the superposed epoch OCB, equatorward boundary and oval width \nwithin \u00b15 hours from t=0 determined from all December 2000 and December and \nJanuary 2001-2002 Frey listed substorms (a total of 451 events). The black trace \nrepresents the boundaries at RMLT=0, green +2 RMLT, orange -2 RMLT, blue  \n+4 RMLT and red -4 RMLT. There is a minimum number of 702 boundary estimates in \nany one of the 13 minute time bins. The standard deviations vary between 2.5 and 3.5\u00b0 \nfor the OCB, 2.4-4.5\u00b0 for the equatorward boundary and 3.1-4.8\u00b0 for the oval width. \nThe standard errors on the means vary from 0.06-0.12 for the OCB, 0.05-0.14 for the \nequatorward boundary and 0.07 to 0.18 for the oval width. \n \nAs expected the OCB gradually moves to lower latitudes during the growth phase of the \nsubstorm (lasting for approximately 100 minutes), the motion being very similar in all \n 99\n OCB \nEquatorward Boundary \nOval Width \nFigure 6.10: Superposed epoch analysis of auroral oval boundary motions keyed \nto substorm onset time for all substorms identified by Frey et al. (2004) for the \nmonths of December 2000 and December and January 2001-2002, a total of 451 \nevents. Panel a shows the motion of the OCB and equatorward boundary of \nauroral oval (top and bottom set of traces respectively) and panel b the derived \nauroral oval width. Black lines represent the motions in the 1 hour MLT sector of \nthe initial auroral brightening identified by Frey et al. (2004). Green, blue, orange \nand red traces represent the motions in MLT sectors at +2, +4, -2 and -4 MLTs \nfrom the onset MLT. The bold vertical line represents the onset time and dashed \nvertical lines represent hours of UT from onset. \nMLT sectors. At RMLT=0 the OCB immediately responds to the onset, rapidly moving \npoleward by approximately 3\u00b0 in the first 30 minutes. The response at \u00b12 RMLT is also \nimmediate, +2 RMLT showing an expansion of ~3.5\u00b0 over the first 50 minutes and  \n-2 RMLT showing a motion of ~3\u00b0 over the first 90 minutes. There is a slight delay of \nup to 10 minutes between the onset and the response of the poleward movement at  \n\u00b14 RMLT, presumably due to the time it takes for the reconnection to move to later and \nearlier MLTs from RMLT=0. The poleward motion in these MLT sectors is smaller and \nmore gradual, with the poleward movement continuing for up to +2 hours compared to \nthe general halt of the poleward movement at +1 hour at other MLT sectors. A poleward \nmotion of ~2\u00b0 is seen in both MLT sectors over approximately the first 100-130 minutes \nafter onset. \n \nThe motion of the equatorward boundary is much less pronounced than for the OCB. As \nexpected, the equatorward boundary slowly drifts to lower latitudes during the growth \nphase. The response of the poleward motion at -2 RMLT is immediate, while a delay of \na few minutes is seen at RMLT=0 and -4 RMLT. This delay increases towards the \ndawnward sector, with a 30 minute delay at +2 RMLT and an hour delay at +4 RMLT. \nAfter the poleward motion the duskward equatorward boundary (-2 and -4 RMLT) is \nlocated at slightly higher latitudes then its pre-onset values. At +2 and +4 RMLT the \nequatorward motion in the growth phase is larger and more prolonged, continuing for \nup to an hour after onset. The subsequent poleward motion is reduced compared to other \nMLTs, leaving the boundary ~ 1\u00b0 equatorward of its pre-onset values. \n  \nThe motions of the OCB and equatorward boundary are reflected in the oval width, \nshown in Figure 6.10b. At RMLT=0, +2 and +4 RMLTs a very similar thinning of the \noval in the growth phase is followed by a rapid thickening in the expansion phase. A \ndelay in the widening of the oval is seen at +4 RMLT due to the delay in the poleward \nmotion of the OCB in this MLT sector. At -2 and -4 RMLTs the widening after onset is \nmuch reduced due to the larger poleward motion of the equatorward boundary in the \nexpansion phase. The boundary and oval width variations are grossly similar to the \nstudy of Mende et al. (2003) but reduced in size and response time. This may be due to \nthe possible inclusion of non-substorm events in our study (i.e. category 3). \n \n 100\nSimilar to the result of Mende et al. (2003), we find that the equatorward boundary is \nlocated at higher latitudes duskward of the onset MLT (-2 and -4 RMLTs, orange and \nred traces) and at lower latitudes more dawnward of onset (+2 and +4 RMLTs, green \nand blue traces). As suggested by Mende et al. this may be explained by the symmetry \nof the auroral oval. The average onset MLT of all the onsets in this study is 23.26 MLT. \nThis suggests that, on average the equatorward boundary of the WIC auroral oval for \nDecember 2000 and December and January 2001-2002 is at its lowest latitude at ~01-02 \nMLT (+2 RMLT), followed by 03-04 MLT (+4 RMLT), 23-00 MLT (RMLT=0), 21-22 \nMLT (-2 RMLT) and finally 19-20 MLT (-4 RMLT). In the study of Mende et al. (2003) \nthe OCB is also located at higher latitudes in the duskward MLT sectors. However, this \nsituation is almost reversed for the location of the OCB in this study, with the OCB \nfound at its lowest latitude at -2 RMLT (orange), followed by RMLT=0 (black),  \n-4 RMLT (red), +2 RMLT (green) and finally +4 RMLT (blue). This is also reflected in \nthe oval widths. In the dawnward sector (green and blue traces), prior to substorm onset, \nthe auroral oval is up to 4-5\u00b0 thicker than at duskward MLTs (orange and red traces). \nDue to the motions of the equatorward boundary and OCB during the expansion phase, \nthis situation is exaggerated following onset. Post-onset the auroral oval becomes \nthinner in the duskward sector and thicker at dawnward MLTs, with the post-onset \ndawnward oval being up to 6-7\u00b0 thicker than in the duskward sector. Visual inspection \nof the WIC auroral ovals confirms this result. \n \nWe attribute this result to the low energy precipitation region often seen to cover several \ndegrees of latitude poleward of the main auroral oval at dawnward MLTs. This is the \nso-called sub-visual drizzle region, which extends away from the main oval \nprecipitation in the post-midnight sector towards the dayside. Mende et al. (2003) \nestimated the high latitude boundary of WIC auroral emission by fitting a double \nGaussian like function to intensity-latitude profiles across 1 hour MLT sectors of the \nauroral oval. They then assume the upper boundary is located at the most poleward \npoint at which the fitted Gaussian is above 50% of the pre-onset averaged maximum \nauroral intensity (averaged from 30-12 minutes before onset). In chapter 4 of this thesis \nwe have shown that the DMSP particle precipitation estimations of the OCB are found \nseveral degrees poleward of the equivalent IMAGE WIC OCB boundary in the \ndawnward sector of the auroral oval. Directly observing the precipitating particles by \nDMSP allows the transition between the low energy sub-visual drizzle region on closed \n 101\nmagnetic field lines and the low-energy polar rain on open magnetic field lines to be \ndirectly determined. Fitting a Gaussian function to the intensity-latitude profiles is much \nweaker at defining this transition, often smoothing the sub-visual drizzle region into the \nbackground part of the fit. The DMSP OCB is therefore found poleward of the WIC \nOCB in the dawnward sector, where the sub-visual drizzle region is prominent, and we \nhave applied a correction to our WIC OCB estimations to account for this. A similar \ncorrection has not been applied in the study of Mende et al. (2003), and, as they state, \nthey are studying the poleward edge of poleward auroral emission rather than the true \nlocation of the OCB. \n \nThis DMSP correction is likely to be the biggest factor affecting the offsets seen, but we \nmust also consider whether a smaller effect may be induced by the viewing angle of the \nIMAGE spacecraft. Figure 3.1 shows the orbit of the IMAGE spacecraft for the five \nmonths of this study. Over the first four months the average viewing angle of the \nspacecraft is located directly over the northern polar cap, with apogee slightly duskward \nin December 2000 and January 2001 and slightly dawnward in December 2001 and \nJanuary 2002. Only in December 2002 is the apogee significantly shifted towards the \ndawnward side. This may cause a slight elongating of the dawn side auroral oval to \nhigher latitudes (as seen by the imager), placing the dawnward OCB at higher latitudes, \nand an elongating of the duskward oval to lower latitudes, placing the duskward \nequatorward boundary at a lower latitude. However, we would expect this effect to be \nminimal and only significant in the final month of the study. Removing the boundary \nestimations of December 2002 from the superposed study does not significantly change \nthe offsets seen. \n \n6.2.3 Superposed Boundary Movements of LANL Categories \n \nFigure 6.11 shows the superposed epoch boundary and oval width movement for the \nthree LANL categories, green category 1, red category 2 and blue category 3, at \nRMLT=0 and \u00b12 and \u00b14 RMLT. There is a minimum of 108 boundary estimates in any \nof the 13 minute time bins. The standard deviations vary between 2.2-4.2\u00b0 for the OCB, \n1.8-5.9\u00b0 for the equatorward boundary and 2.6-5.2\u00b0 for the oval width. The standard \ndeviations vary between 0.09-0.36\u00b0 for the OCB, 0.08-0.39\u00b0 for the equatorward \nboundary and 0.13-0.49\u00b0 for the oval width. Figure 6.12 shows the superposed latitude \n 102\n  Minutes Relative to Onset \nFigure 6.11: Superposed epoch analysis of the motion of OCB, equatorward \nboundary of the auroral oval and auroral oval width keyed to substorm onset \ntime for category 1 (green), category 2 (red) and category 3 (blue) substorm \nevents at the MLT sector of the initial auroral brightening (Onset MLT) and at \n\u00b12 and \u00b14 MLTs from the onset MLT. The bold vertical line represents the time \nof onset and dashed grey vertical lines represent hours from onset. \n \nMinutes Relative to Onset \nFigure 6.12: Superposed epoch analysis of the motion of the OCB for the entire \nauroral oval. OCB estimates have been averaged over 3 hours of MLT. Category \n1 events are shown by green, category 2 by red and category 3 by blue. The \nvertical solid line at 0 minutes shows the time of onset and the dashed vertical \nlines show hours from onset. \nvariation of the OCB averaged over 3 MLT sectors around the entire auroral oval. \nStandard deviations are of the order 2-4\u00b0 and standard errors 0.1-0.3\u00b0. A similar plot is \nnot possible for the equatorward boundary due to the lack of accurate estimates of the \nequatorward boundary on the dayside due to low-latitude dayglow swamping the \nequatorward edge of the auroral oval. \n \n6.2.3.1 Motion of the OCB \n \nThe OCB motion for category 1 and 2 events is very similar and follows the general \ntrends seen for all substorms at all MLT sectors. Category 3 events (blue) show smaller \nOCB motions in all MLT sectors. The equatorward motion and subsequent poleward \nexpansion of the OCB is seen at all MLT sectors for category 1 events shown in Figure \n6.12, showing these events to be truly global in nature. The poleward and equatorward \nboundary motions varying between ~ 1-4\u00b0, with the largest boundary motions closer to \nmidnight.  \n \nCategory 2 events (red) show the expected equatorward and poleward motions on the \nnightside (18-06 MLT, Figure 6.12). A poleward expansion is also evident in the 06 to \n09 MLT sector after an ~ 1 hour delay from onset. In the 15-18 MLT sector the OCB \ndrifts equatorward during the growth phase, remains at an almost constant latitude \nbetween the onset time and +2 hours, before moving poleward by less than 1\u00b0.  In both \nthe 09-12 and 12-15 MLT sectors the OCB continues to move to lower latitudes for \n ~ 2 hours after onset, indicating that open magnetic flux is still being added on the \ndayside. This is not seen for category 1 events (green) and is consistent with the \nincreased dayside driving suggested by the elevated levels of the \u03b5 parameter for \ncategory 2 events (Figure 6.1m, see section 6.1.2.1). \n \nCategory 3 events show a clear equatorward and poleward motion around onset \nbetween 15-00 MLT. The movement is much less clear at 00-15 MLT, with the \nfluctuations around onset of a similar magnitude to those of the rest of the period of \nstudy, suggesting that these are not significant. These results suggest that category 3 \nevents are highly localised reconnection events which do not become a global \nphenomenon. \n \n 103\nMany previous studies have shown that the initial onset region is located within the \nclosed magnetic field line region of the auroral oval, some distance from the OCB (e.g. \nG\u00e9rard et al., 2004). We therefore might expect to see a short delay between the \npoleward motion of the OCB and substorm onset due to the time it takes for the \nreconnection to eat through closed magnetic flux before proceeding onto open magnetic \nfield lines. However, and as reported in previous studies (Mende et al., 2003), this is not \nseen in the superposed boundary plots. The OCB is seen to respond immediately to \nsubstorm onset at midnight MLTs with a short delay only evident at 3-18 MLT in \nFigure 6.12 and \u00b1 4 RMLT in Figure 6.11. This short delay is presumably due to the \ntime it takes for the reconnection to travel to earlier and later MLTs from the onset \nMLT. One explanation of this lack of delay at midnight could be due to the timing of \nsubstorm onset in our study. Due to the temporal resolution of the IMAGE spacecraft \nwe can only determine the time of the initial brightening to within 2 minutes. However, \nas pointed out by Voronkov et al. (2003), the initial auroral brightening (as may be seen \nby ground-based all-sky cameras) is often below the threshold of UV detectors such that \nthere may be a time delay of up to ~5 minutes between the true onset time and the first \nauroral brightening seen by UV auroral imagers. Reducing the bin size of the \nsuperposed study does not effect the trends seen, but does significantly increase the size \nof the standard deviations and standard errors. \n \n6.2.3.2 Motion of Equatorward Boundary \n \nThe motion of the category 1 equatorward boundary (green Figure 6.11, middle row) \nvery closely follows the motions seen for all substorms. That is, a smaller poleward \nmotion and longer delay between onset and the poleward turning of the boundary for \nfurther dawnward MLTs (+2 and +4 RMLT). Category 1 events show the largest \nboundary movements of the three categories. Category 2 events show the same general \ntrends as for all substorms and category 1 events, but with, in general, smaller poleward \nmovements after onset. Category 2 events also show a slightly longer delay between the \nonset time and poleward turning of the equatorward boundary at +2 and +4 RMLTs as \ncompared to category 1 events. As expected, the category 3 equatorward boundary is \nfound at higher latitudes than category 1 or 2 due to the contracted auroral ovals for this \ncategory. The equatorward boundary of category 3 events does not follow the typical \nboundary movements expected around substorm onset.  At -4 and -2 RMLT the category \n 104\n3 equatorward boundary continually moves towards higher latitudes from \napproximately T=0 until the end of the period of study. At +4 and +2 RMLT this \nmotion is generally reversed. \n \n6.2.3.3 Oval Width Variation \n \nThe oval width of category 1 and 2 events also follow each other closely at all MLTs \nand show the general trends of all substorms. The category 3 oval width is more \ncomplicated due to the less typical motions of the OCB and equatorward boundaries. At \nthe onset MLT the oval width variation is similar to that of category 1 and 2, showing \nthe expected thinning and thickening motion typical of a substorm. Due to the poleward \nmotion of the equatorward boundary at -4 and -2 RMLT, the oval width generally \ndecreases for the whole period of study in the duskward sector. At +2 and +4 RMLT the \noval width remains relatively constant. The boundary motions suggest that category 3 \nevents are much smaller, much more localised events than either category 1 or 2. \n \n6.3 Discussion \n \nIn order to have confidence in any conclusions drawn from this study it is important to \ndiscuss the statistical significance of the trends and variations seen in the superposed \nplots. To give an indication of the error on the mean for each LANL category, we plot \nthe standard error on the mean (the standard deviation divided by the root of the total \nnumber of events in each 13 minute bin, grey shaded region) on the superposed plots of \nFigures 6.2-6.4 along with the null lines for each category (representing the average \nvariations of the parameters for the period of study, grey line). Further, we find a small \nnumber of events in each category which occur during relatively enhanced solar wind \nconditions from the average behaviour seen in each category. Removing these events \nfrom the superposed analysis does not effect the average trends seen in any of the \ncategories and we conclude that the variations and trends seen in Figures 6.1-6.4 are \ntrue representations of the differing LANL categories. \n \nThe standard deviations of the superposed boundary plots in Figures 6.8, 6.9 and 6.10 \nvary from ~2-4\u00b0 for the OCB, 2-6\u00b0 for the equatorward boundary and ~3-5\u00b0 for the oval \nwidth. The standard error on the mean varies between 0.06-0.36\u00b0 for the OCB,  \n 105\n0.05-0.39\u00b0 for the equatorward boundary and 0.07-0.49 for the oval width, less than the \ndeviations in boundary movements which we consider to be significant. \n \nHere let us bring together the main findings of the superposed Fpc, solar wind and IMF, \ngeomagnetic activity, maximum nightside auroral intensity and auroral boundary \nmotions and discuss their implications for the three LANL categories. \n \nThe category 1 superposed Fpc, solar wind and IMF conditions and geomagnetic activity \nare shown by the green traces of Figures 6.1-6.2. Category 1 events are the largest and \nmost energetic of the three LANL categories. They occur with the highest Fpc at onset \n(panel a Figures 6.1 and 6.2) and show the largest peaks in auroral intensity (panels b) \nand magnetic indices (panels l and n). They show the most obvious growth and \nexpansion phases in Fpc and geomagnetic indices. They close the most Fpc during the \nexpansion phase, ~20% consistent with the amount of Fpc closed in previous substorm \nstudies (e.g. Caan et al., 1978; McPherron and Hsu, 2002; Huang et al., 2009). They \nshow the sharpest increase and subsequent decrease in auroral intensity and AL and AU \nindices. They occur in periods of enhanced geomagnetic activity (AL, AU and SYM-H) \nbut average IMF and solar wind conditions (pressure, proton density and IMF BBy, BxB , BBt, \npanels e, g and d respectively). The dayside reconnection is strongly controlled by the \nIMF BzB  component (panel c), which shows a significant southward turning and \nsubsequent northward recovery typical of a \u2018classical\u2019 substorm onset growth phase \n(McPherron et al., 1973). The superposed boundary study (green traces Figures 6.9-\n6.10) shows that the category 1 events are truly global in nature, with the typical \nboundary movements expected around substorm onset seen at all MLTs. In conclusion, \ncategory 1 events show all the expected signatures of a \u2018classic\u2019 substorm event. It \nseems likely that category 1 events are large, energetic substorms occurring due to a \nlarge southward turning of the IMF BBz component during otherwise average IMF and \nsolar wind conditions. \n \nThe superposed category 2 Fpc, solar wind, IMF and geomagnetic activity is shown by \nthe red traces of Figures 6.1 and 6.3. Category 2 events occur at slightly lower values of \nFpc than category 1 events, with a more gradual increase in Fpc during the growth phase, \nwhich lasts for approximately 30 minutes longer than for category 1 events. After onset \nthe decrease in Fpc (panels a), auroral intensity (panels b) and geomagnetic indices \n 106\n(panels l and n) is also more gradual, with the recovery lasting for up to 2 hours after the \nonset. Fpc remains elevated after onset due to the continued dayside driving (\u03b5 panels m) \ncontinuing to add open magnetic flux to the polar cap balancing the flux closed by \nnightside reconnection. The continued dayside driving appears to be more driven by the \nelevated IMF BBy component (panels e) for these events. Category 2 events also occur \nwith elevated solar wind pressure and proton density (panels i and j). As with category 1 \nevents, category 2 events show the expected OCB, equatorward boundary and oval \nwidth motions (red traces Figures 6.9 and 6.10) around onset typical of substorm onsets. \nThese boundary motions are reduced in size compared to category 1 events, perhaps \nsuggesting that these events are smaller or less energetic than category 1. However, the \nreduced size of boundary motions can also be explained by the continued driving of \nthese events by the solar wind and continued addition of Fpc during the expansion phase. \n \nThe category 3 Fpc, solar wind, IMF and geomagnetic activity is shown by the blue \ntraces of Figures 6.1 and 6.4. Category 3 events do not show the typical growth and \nexpansion phases in Fpc (panels a), with Fpc continuing to rise after the onset time \ndespite the very low dayside driving (\u03b5, panels m), suggesting that nightside \nreconnection does not progress to open magnetic field lines. There is no large \nsouthward turning of the IMF BBz component (panels c) expected in the growth phase of \na classical substorm onset. A slight increase and subsequent slow decline is seen in the \nmaximum nightside auroral intensity. This is evidently the auroral brightening \nindentified by Frey et al., (2004) as substorm onset. Small-scale magnetic bays are also \nseen in the AL (<100 nT) and AU (<50 nT) indices, but these are below the average \nactivity as represented by the null lines (grey lines Figures 6.1-6.4). Pseudo-breakups \nare known to be associated with small geomagnetic bays of less than 100 nT  \n(Koskinen et al., 1993), suggesting that pseudo-breakups may be included in this \ncategory. As well as occurring during quiet geomagnetic conditions (AL, AU and SYM-\nH Figures 6.1 and 6.4 l and n), they also occur during periods of weak solar wind flow \n(pressure, proton density, BtB , BBz and Vx Figure 6.1 and 6.4) also typical of very weak \nsubstorms or pseudo-breakups (e.g. Zhou and Tsurutani 2001; Kullen and Karlson \n2004). The average IMF ByB  component (panels e) is shifted toward negative values, \nthough this appears to be at least partly due to a bias in a portion of our solar wind data. \n \n 107\nThe category 3 OCB (blue Figure 6.11 and 6.10) shows the expected equatorward \nmotion in the growth phase and poleward recovery during the expansion phase. \nHowever, this motion is much reduced in latitudinal extent compared to category 1 and \n2 events and is only evident close to the onset MLT. This suggest that category 3 events \nare relatively small, localised events. The motions of the equatorward boundary is \natypical of classically defined substorm onsets. \n \nThe Frey onset list may include a number of events which are not true substorm events \n(see chapter 5), and this list may include a number of weaker events which may cause \nsubstorm-like auroral brightenings such as pseudo-breakups or Poleward Boundary \nIntensifications (PBIs). The reduced activity in all parameters of this study for category \n3 events and lack of typical substorm onset signatures suggests that these events may \nnot all be substorms. The superposed boundary movements suggest that some of these \nevents may be very small, localised low energy reconnection events, while the small \ngeomagnetic bays suggest that they may be pseudo-breakup events or failed substorms. \nAnother phenomenon which may cause nightside auroral brightenings are Poleward \nBoundary Intensifications (see McPherron et al., 2008 and references therein). PBIs are \nnightside auroral intensifications which occur on the poleward edge of the auroral oval, \nwhich may or may not subsequently move equatorward with time and have been \nobserved to occur during SMC events as well as often occurring during the expansion \nphase of substorms. One way of distinguishing PBI events from true substorms might \nbe to look at the \u2018onset latitude\u2019 relative to the locations of the OCB and equatorward \nboundary of the auroral oval. \n \nWe have estimated the latitude of both the OCB and equatorward boundary of the \nauroral oval for all substorms used in this study, allowing us to investigate the location \nof the onset relative to these boundaries. Figure 6.13a shows the fractional occurrence \ndistribution of the difference between the latitude of the OCB averaged over 6 minutes \nprior to substorm onset at the onset MLT, and the initial onset arc (provided in the \nsubstorm list of Frey et al., 2004). Both category 1 (green) and category 2 (red) show a \nlarger fraction of events occurring within 2\u00b0 of the OCB than do category 3. If PBI \nevents are present in the Frey substorm list, then these are not exclusively found within \ncategory 3. Only 9 category 3 events occur within 2\u00b0 of the OCB. G\u00e9rard et al. (2004) \nfound the location of the onset latitude relative to the OCB for 78 substorm onsets from \n 108\nNovember 2000 to January 2001, overlapping our dataset. They found that the latitude \ndifference varied between 0 and ~ 15\u00b0 with the majority of the events below 5\u00b0 (see \ntheir Figure 4a). Our results are consistent with these findings. G\u00e9rard et al. (2004) also \nnoted that the average latitude difference between the onset location and the \nequatorward boundary is most often between 2-6\u00b0, which is also consistent with our \nresults. However, G\u00e9rard et al. (2004) do not present the latitude differences as a \nfraction of the auroral oval width or discuss the location of the onset within the auroral \noval. \n \nFigure 6.13b shows the fractional occurrence distribution of the OCB-onset latitude \ndifference as a fraction of the oval width. Rather surprisingly the onset location is on \naverage closer to the OCB than the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval for all \nthree LANL categories, all with approximately the same mean of 0.4 and with a skew \ntowards the onset latitude being closer to the OCB. A DMSP correction has been \napplied to the OCB in this study so we should consider whether this effects the offsets \nseen. The onset MLTs of the substorms in this study vary from ~ 17.5-3.5 MLT. \nBetween 23 and 3.5 MLT the DMSP correction (Figure 4.5) shifts the OCB poleward \nby between 1-2\u00b0. Between 17 and 23 MLT the OCB is shifted equatorward by ~1\u00b0. We \nexpect half of the OCBs will be shifted poleward by the DMSP correction and half \nequatorward by approximately the same amount. Therefore we do not expect the DMSP \ncorrection to effect the overall mean of the OCB-onset latitude distribution. We also \nconsider whether the Gaussian fitting routine results in the offsets seen. At onset there is \nrapid brightening of the auroral oval at the latitude of the initial onset arc. The peak \nintensity at this latitude will be much greater than the intensity at other latitudes within \nthe auroral oval. Although we use the most poleward fitted Gaussian to find the OCB \nand the most equatorward to find the low latitude boundary, at substorm onset the rapid \nbrightening may cause only one Gaussian fit to be made to the data with the peak \nlocated at the latitude of the onset brightening. Thus the onset latitude would be found \nhalf way between the OCB and equatorward boundaries (both located a FWHM \npoleward and equatorward of the Gaussian peak respectively). However, if this were the \ncase the rapid increase in the peak of the Gaussian intensity would cause a rapid \nthinning of the Gaussian width of the fitted Gaussians and thus a rapid movement of the \nOCB towards lower latitudes and a rapid movement of the equatorward boundary \ntowards higher latitudes would be seen. However, this is not seen in the superposed \n 109\n  \n \n(a) \n \n(b) \nFigure 6.13 : Fractional occurrence distributions of (a) the latitude difference \nbetween the OCB at the MLT of the initial auroral brightening and the onset \nlatitude of the initial auroral brightening; (b) the latitude difference between \nthe OCB and onset latitude as a fraction of auroral oval width. Category 1 \nevents are shown by green, category 2 by red and category 3 by blue. \nboundary movements. Moreover, we have averaged the OCB location over the  \n6 minutes prior to substorm onset to negate any effect this may have. \n \nPrevious studies have suggested that the initial onset arc is located several degrees \nequatorward of the OCB, closer to the equatorward edge of the auroral oval than \npoleward edge (e.g. Murphree et al., 1993; Lyons et al., 2002). However our results are \nconsistent with the findings of G\u00e9rard et al. (2004) in which for the majority of cases \nthe onset location is less than 5\u00b0 from the OCB. Murphree et al. (1993) used Viking UV \nauroral images to identify the location of the onset within the auroral oval. They found \nthat the onset was located in the poleward part of the diffuse aurora. Sotirelis and \nNewell (2000) have shown that approximately half of the auroral oval is made up of \ndiscrete auroral precipitation and half by diffuse emission. Initial plots of the total \nelectron flux-latitude profile across the auroral oval as measured by the SOPA \ninstrument onboard the LANL spacecraft suggest that our estimation of the OCB from \nWIC is located at the poleward edge of the discrete electron precipitation and that the \nestimation of the equatorward edge of the WIC auroral oval is roughly located at the \nequatorward edge of the diffuse electron precipitation. If the onset is indeed located at \nthe poleward edge of the diffuse precipitation (approximately half way between our \nOCB and equatorward boundary) then this may explain the offsets seen. Unfortunately, \nthere are no coincident crossing of the auroral oval at the MLT of onset for any of the \nsubstorms in our study to investigate this further. \n \nCaution should also be taken for, as pointed out by Voronkov et al. (2003), the initial \nonset arc as seen by ground-based observations has a thickness of only tens of \nkilometres, similar to the size of the smallest structure which can be resolved by WIC \n(Mende et al. 2000b). The initial onset arc brightens for several minutes before \nexpanding poleward  and may only have a slightly enhanced intensity compared to pre-\nexisting growth phase arcs (e.g. Lyons et al. (2002) and references therein). Thus the \nresolution of space-based imagery may not be able to resolve the initial onset arc until it \nhas brightened significantly. Onset arcs can exhibit a large range of intensities  \n(e.g. Voronkov et al., 2000) and coupled with the 2 minute resolution of the WIC \nauroral images, it is unclear at what stage the onset arc becomes resolvable in the WIC \nauroral image. Thus the arc may have travelled several degrees poleward by the time it \n 110\nis seen using visual inspection of auroral images. A more extensive study of the onset \nlocation within the auroral oval is beyond the scope of this present work. \n \nThree distinctly different categories of particle injection events have been indentified, \neach with their own distinct characteristics. Here let us discuss what these \ncharacteristics may tell us about the injection process for these different events. \n \nCategory 1 events are defined by their \u2018classic\u2019 substorm particle injection signatures \nand show all the expected signatures of large classically defined substorm onsets. That \nis, they have a typical growth phase in which large amounts of open magnetic flux is \nadded to polar cap. This should result in a thinning of the plasma sheet. LANL \nspacecraft near midnight observe a dropout in particle fluxes which we interpret as the \nspacecraft moving out of the thinning plasma sheet and the expansion of the cold dense \nplasmasphere to geosynchronous orbit due to tail field line stretching (e.g. Moldwin et \nal., 1996). At onset the formation of the NENL or current disruption creates an \nEarthward travelling injection boundary behind which particles of all energies are \ninjected simultaneously (e.g. Birn et al., 1997). A spacecraft located near midnight, in \nthe injection region, observes a dispersionless enhancement of both energetic electrons \nand protons. Electrons subsequently drift eastward and protons westward due to \ngradient and curvature drift and are detected as a dispersed energy signature by \nspacecraft located at later and earlier MLTs. Dispersion increases in the eastward \ndirection for electrons and in the westward direction for protons. The evolution of \nparticle injection in such a manner is defined as a \u2018typical\u2019 or \u2018classic\u2019 substorm \ninjection signature. \n \nCategory 2 events cover all events which show energetic particle enhancements at \ngeosynchronous orbit, as seen by LANL, not showing the expected evolution of a \nsubstorm injection event described above. LANL data shows that these events often \noccur during periods of very active and complicated energetic particle fluctuations. This \nincludes events where the signature is being confused with the signature of other \nprocesses, for example drift echoes from previous substorms, enhancements related to \nsolar wind pressure pulses (Lee et al., 2005) or large flux dropouts as the spacecraft \nleave the plasma sheet. Category 2 events may be substorms associated with or \ntriggered by these other events, or may in fact be these non-substorm events themselves. \n 111\nHowever, the solar wind and IMF data (see Figures 6.1 and 6.3) suggest that category 2 \nevents are highly driven by the solar wind and IMF BBy component, suggesting that the \ncontinued driving of the magnetosphere during the expansion phase of these events has \na direct impact on energetic particle injection into geosynchronous orbit. It seems likely \nthat the more active energetic particle fluctuations seen around the time of onset for \ncategory 2 events is a result of this continued driving and that the injection signature of \nthese events is masked or complicated due to this increase in activity. \n \nCategory 3 events show no enhancement of energetic particles at any MLTs, i.e. they \nlack substorm injections. Figure 6.14 shows the distribution of the magnetic latitude of \nthe initial auroral brightening indentified by Frey et al. (2004). One may argue that \ncategory 3 events occur at higher latitudes than either category 1 and 2 events (although \nthere is significant overlap) and that therefore their reconnection sites map to further \ndown tail. Miyashita et al. (2004) used observations of the tail magnetic field variations \nduring substorms to show that the initial reconnection site of intense substorms  \n(e.g. category 1) tend to be located closer to the Earth than weaker events (e.g. category \n3). Nagai et al. (2005) also showed that substorms occurring with stronger or more \nefficient solar wind energy input (i.e. category 1\/2) have their onset location closer to \nthe Earth than those with weaker driving (i.e. category 3). If the reconnection region for \ncategory 3 events did indeed map to far down the magnetotail then we may expect that \nany subsequent particle injection associated with these events may not be energetic \nenough to reach geosynchronous orbit. However, a tail magnetic field line fixed at a \nconstant latitude will become more stretched as more open magnetic flux is added to the \ntail lobes and its L-shell value (a value describing the distance from the centre of the \nEarth to the location at which a field line crosses the equatorial plane of the Earth) \nincreases (as represented in Figure 6.15). The tail is thus expected to be less stretched \nfor category 3 events compared to the higher flux at onset events of category 1 and 2. \nAlthough the initial onset of category 3 events appears to occur at higher latitudes in the \nionosphere than either category 1 or 2, the reconnection site (which occurs in the plasma \nsheet in the equatorial plane of the Earth and is thus located at a distance from the Earth \ngiven by the L-shell value) may in fact map to smaller L-shells, and closer to the Earth, \nthan either category 1 or 2 events. We also note that the ring current as measured by the \nSYM-H index is very low for category 3 events and therefore we would not expect \ninjections to be impeded from reaching geosynchronous orbit. Investigating the \n 112\n (a) \n \n (b) \nFigure 6.14: Number, (a), and fractional, (b), occurrence distributions of the \nlatitude of the initial onset arc identified by Frey et al. (2004) as the start of \nsubstorm onset for category 1 events (green), category 2 events (red) and category 3 \nevents (blue). \n \nFigure 6.15: Schematic of how the magnetotail becomes more stretched and \nless dipolar when more open magnetic flux is added to the system. The solid \nlines represent the magnetosphere in its loaded state, that is, with large open \nmagnetic flux content, and dashed lines show how field lines fixed at a \nconstant latitude would become more dipolar, and move closer to the Earth in \nthe equatorial plane (shown by the dashed horizontal line), when the open \nmagnetic flux content decreases. \nmagnetotail field line stretching and tail field variations during these events may allow \nus to determine the onset location with some degree of accuracy and provide important \ninsights into the tail dynamics and injection processes for the three distinct categories. \nSuch a study is beyond the scope of this thesis. \n \n6.4 Summary and Conclusions \n \n6.4.1 Auroral Boundary Motions \n \nWe have carried out the largest superposed study to date of the WIC OCB, equatorward \nauroral oval boundary and oval width motions around the time of substorm onset from \n451 Frey substorm events from the December and January months of 2000-2001. The \noffsets and variations seen are grossly consistent with the study of the poleward edge of \nWIC auroral emission by Mende et al. (2003), giving us confidence in the validity of \nour method. However, converse to the results of Mende et al (2003) we find that the \nOCB is located at higher latitudes dawnward of the onset MLT. We attribute this result \nto the DMSP correction applied in our study and used to give a better determination of \nthe true OCB location, shifting the OCB poleward by up to 2\u00b0 in the dawnward sector \nand by equatorward by up to 1\u00b0 in the duskward sector. We summarise the results of our \nstudy as follows: \n(1) Both OCB and equatorward boundaries drift equatorward in the growth phase of the \nsubstorm, the motions being very similar in all MLT sectors. \n(2) The OCB shows a rapid poleward expansion at the time of substorm onset, the \nmotion being very similar at the onset MLT and + 2 RMLT. The response at -2 RMLT is \nalso immediate, but the poleward motion is less rapid. There is a delay of ~10 minutes \nbetween onset and the poleward response at \u00b1 4 RMLT and the extent of the motion is \nreduced. \n(3) The equatorward boundary moves to higher latitudes immediately after onset at  \n-2 RMLT. The equatorward motion continues for a few minutes after onset at the onset \nMLT and -4 RMLT before a rapid poleward motion is seen. This delay increases to ~ 30 \nand ~ 60 minutes for +2 and +4 RMLT respectively. \n(4) The latitude difference between the OCB and equatorward edge of the auroral oval \n(oval width) is larger dawnward of the onset MLT (+2 and +4 MLT). \n 113\n(5) The OCB-equatorward boundary latitude difference increases after onset at \ndawnward MLTs and decreases at duskward MLTs. \n \n6.4.2 Study of LANL Categories \n \nUsing all substorm onsets from the months of December and January 2000-2002 \nidentified by Frey et al. (2004), in chapter 5 of this thesis we identified three differing \ncategories of substorms defined by their particle injection signatures as seen by the \nLANL spacecraft. We showed that substorms showing a \u2018classic\u2019 particle injection \nsignature of substorm onset (category 1) occur on average at higher values of open \nmagnetic flux than those showing varied (category 2) or no activity (category 3). In this \nchapter we have investigated these LANL categories in more detail by carrying out a \nsuperposed epoch analysis of Fpc, solar wind and IMF conditions, geomagnetic activity \nand motions of the OCB and equatorward boundary of the auroral oval. \n \nWe summarise our current understanding of the three LANL categories below: \n(1) Category 1 events show all the expected signatures of large energetic substorm \nevents occurring due to a large southward turning of the IMF BBz component during \notherwise average solar wind and geomagnetic activity. \n(2) The variations and trends of all category 2 parameters are consistent with substorms \noccurring during continuous solar wind driving, i.e. these events are highly driven by \nthe solar wind and they occur during periods of stronger solar wind flow. The IMF BBy \ncomponent appears to play a large role in the dayside driving for these events. \n(3) Category 3 events do not show the expected signatures of true global substorm \nevents. It is likely that this category consists of very weak substorm events, pseudo-\nbreakups or other events which may cause nightside auroral brightenings. \n(4) These results have important implications for those wishing to use the Frey onset list \nfor future substorm studies. Splitting substorm studies by these LANL categories may \nprovide important insights into different types of substorm events and energetic particle \ninjections. For example, our results suggest that the level of solar wind driving and \ncontinued energy input during substorms has a direct impact on the evolution and \nsignature of substorm injections. Substorms showing the classical substorm injection \nsignature may be more controlled by the loading-unloading scheme, whilst more varied \nenergetic particle fluctuations may be an indication of a more directly driven event. \n 114\nChapter 7. Summary and Future Work \n \n7.1 Summary \n \nIn this thesis we have investigated the relationship between the open magnetic flux \ncontent of the magnetosphere and substorm onsets. In chapter 4 we developed an \nautomated method of identifying the global location of the open\/closed magnetic field \nline boundary (OCB) in the ionosphere from global auroral images of the northern polar \ncap taken in the far ultraviolet (FUV) by the IMAGE spacecraft. Comparing the latitude \nof the OCB as approximated by the three different FUV detectors onboard IMAGE, the \nWideband Imaging Camera (WIC; 140-190 nm) and spectrographic imagers SI12 \n(~121.82 nm) and SI13 (~ 135.6 nm), we found that the modal latitude differences are \nsmall (<1\u00b0) except in the evening and predawn sectors. In the evening sector SI12 OCB \nproxies are found between 1-2\u00b0 poleward of WIC and SI13 OCB proxies and vice-versa \nin the dawnward magnetic local time (MLT) sectors (see Figure 4.6). \n \nIn-situ measurements of precipitating particles from low-latitude spacecraft, such as the \nDMSP spacecraft, currently provide the most direct and precise determination of the \nlocation of the OCB at any one MLT but are, however, unable to produce a global \nproxy due to their limited spatial coverage. In chapter 4 we also compared the FUV \nOCB proxies with the OCB as estimated by DMSP measurements. We found systematic \noffsets (see Figure 4.5) between the two OCB estimation methods consistent with \nprevious studies which used more limited data sets or auroral imagery from different \nspacecraft and for only one wavelength (e.g. Carbary et al., 2003 and references \ntherein). Previous studies have suggested that the WIC detector may be an unreliable \nproxy for the OCB in the predawn sector (e.g. Wild et al., 2004) and we indeed find that \nthe SI12 OCB proxies give a closer match to the DMSP OCB proxies in the dawnward \nMLT sector. However, we also show that at other MLTs the WIC and SI13 OCB \nproxies give a good as, if not better, correlation with DMSP OCBs. Hence, the best \nmethod for identifying the global OCB from the IMAGE FUV detectors may be to use \nthe FUV detector which produces the closest statistical match to DMSP OCB proxies at \neach individual MLT. For studies using a single instrument, WIC images may provide \n 115\nthe best global proxy for the OCB due to its higher spatial resolution (~50 km at \napogee) compared to either of the spectrographic imagers (~100 km at apogee). \n \nAssuming that the DMSP OCB proxies give the best estimation of the true location of \nthe OCB, the systematic offsets found between the FUV and DMSP OCB proxies can \nbe used to \u2018correct\u2019 the FUV OCB proxies to give a more accurate global proxy for the \nOCB. Since the OCB delineates the open magnetic field lines of the polar cap and more \nequatorward closed magnetic field lines, once the global location of the OCB has been \ndetermined it is a simple matter to estimate the open magnetic flux content of the \nhemisphere (Fpc) by summing the radial component of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field \nthrough the area of the polar cap. In chapter 5 of this thesis, we developed the method of \nchapter 4 to estimate the global location of the OCB and open magnetic flux in such a \nmanner. Applying this method to all WIC auroral images of the northern polar cap from \nthe December and January months of 2000 to 2002 returned the distribution of the \naverage open magnetic flux content of the northern polar cap (Fpc) from 12,731 separate \nauroral images. From this parent distribution we extracted the distribution of Fpc at the \ntime of substorm onset using the Frey list of substorm onsets (Frey et al., 2004). The \nparent distribution varied between ~ 0.2 and ~ 0.9 GWb with a mean flux value of  \n~ 0.52 GWb (Figure 5.5, unshaded histogram panels a-e). The substorm distribution \n(173 events) varied between ~ 0.3 and 0.9 GWb, with a mean of ~ 0.58 GWb (Figure \n5.5, shaded histogram panel a). From these large datasets, we were able, for the first \ntime, to determine the probability of substorm onset as a function of open magnetic flux \n(Figure 5.5f). The probability of substorm onset is negligible below ~ 0.3 GWb, \nincreases almost linearly until an Fpc of ~ 0.9 GWb, and is undefined above this as \nfluxes above this value are not observed in this study. \n \nWe also found that not all substorms within the substorm distribution showed the \nexpected signature of energetic particle injection for substorm onsets. Splitting the \nsubstorm distribution into three categories based on their injection signatures as seen at \ngeosynchronous orbit by the LANL spacecraft we found that, on average, substorms \nshowing a clear and classic injection signature of substorm onset (category 1) occur at \nhigher values of open magnetic flux than those showing varied (category 2, all energetic \nenhancements not following the expected substorm evolution) or no (category 3) \ninjection activity (Figure 5.5. panels b-e and g-j). \n 116\n The results of this study show that the substorm distribution occurs at the upper end of \nthe parent distribution, as not unexpected due to the growth phase requirement of \nsubstorm onset, and that no substorms occur below ~ 0.3 GWb, suggesting a minimal \nthreshold in open magnetic flux required for substorm onset. The distributions also \nshow that there is no fixed critical threshold in open magnetic flux as a necessary \ncondition for substorm onset, as suggested by some models (e.g. Freeman and Morley, \n2004). Other models for substorm onset suggest that a change in the solar wind is \nrequired to trigger substorm onset (e.g. Lyons et al., 1995; Hsu and McPherron, 2002). \nOur distributions are not consistent with a model in which once some minimal critical \nthreshold in open magnetic flux has been reached a solar wind trigger must be waited \nfor. However, they may be consistent with a threshold in open magnetic flux whose \nvalue depends on other magnetospheric or ionospheric conditions (e.g. the strength of \nthe ring current, see Milan et al., 2009a,b). \n  \nIn chapter 6 we investigated the three distinct particle injection categories of substorm \nevents further by carrying out a superposed epoch analysis of Fpc, solar wind and IMF \nconditions, maximum nightside auroral intensity, geomagnetic activity and motions of \nthe OCB and equatorward auroral boundary during these events (Figures 6.1-6.4, 6.9 \nand 6.10). Category 1 events clearly show the expected signatures of large energetic \nsubstorms in all parameters. The growth phase of these events is characterised by a \nlarge southward turning of the IMF and subsequent recovery. They occur in otherwise \naverage IMF and solar wind conditions. These events appear to be largely driven by the \nBBz component of the IMF. While the loading-unloading scheme seems to dominate the \ncategory 1 events, the directly driven process would appear to be more important for \ncategory 2 events. The IMF BzB , though not reaching the magnitudes of category 1 \nevents, remains negative throughout the expansion phase suggesting that dayside \nreconnection is ongoing throughout. The IMF BBy component would also appear to play a \nlarger role in the driving of these events. They also occur under stronger solar wind \nflow in general. Finally, category 3 events do not show the expected signatures of \nsubstorms, occur with very weak solar wind conditions and IMF driving, and appear to \nbe highly localised tail reconnection events. We conclude that category 3 events are \neither very weak substorms or pseudo-breakups. This relationship between the level of \nsolar wind driving and particle injection signatures is a new and unexpected result. \n 117\nThese categories provide an important sub-categorisation of the Frey onset list and \nfuture investigation of these categories may provide more important insights into the \nsubstorm process. \n \nIn summary, this thesis has produced several important results which have increased our \nunderstanding of magnetospheric substorms and which have important implications for, \nand place important constraints on, future models of substorm onset. \n \n7.2 Future Work \n \nIn chapter 4 of this thesis we developed an automated method of identifying the location \nof the OCB in the ionosphere from global auroral images taken by the three FUV \ndetectors onboard the IMAGE spacecraft. In chapters 5 and 6 we used this method to \nestimate the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere from auroral images of \nthe northern polar cap for the December and January months of 2000-2002. In this study \nwe chose to use only winter months due to the much reduced levels of dayglow and \ngeneral reduction in background noise during the winter. A natural extension of the \nwork carried out in this thesis would be to extend the datasets to other seasons. \nHowever, the automated method of OCB identification was developed using auroral \nimages from winter months. We found that applying the automated method, as is, to \nother months returned many more erroneous boundary estimations passing the fitting \ncriteria than during December and January. We attribute this result to the much \nincreased levels of dayglow and background noise during summer. A condition of the \nboundary fitting routine is that the background noise must be below a particular ratio of \nthe maximum image intensity. This condition often fails in the summer, also resulting in \nmuch fewer boundary estimations. This condition also means that boundaries are only \nestimated for particularly bright auroral ovals in the summer, when they are much more \nintense then the background FUV emission, thus biasing any results returned. It is clear \nthat there are several issues when applying the automated method to summer months \nand that the method needs significant, but not unachievable, modification to produce \naccurate and unbiased results for summer. This would allow the comparison of the \naverage Fpc content of the magnetosphere and Fpc for substorms, as well as LANL \nparticle injection events, for different seasons. \n \n 118\nIn this thesis we have investigated the open magnetic flux and auroral dynamics of the \nnorthern polar cap. During 2003 the apogee of the IMAGE spacecraft moved from the \nnorthern to southern hemispheres, with auroral imagery mostly coming from the \nsouthern pole after 2003. Another natural extension of the work carried out in this thesis \nwould be the investigation of the southern open magnetic flux and auroral dynamics \nduring substorms. However, at the time of the work carried out in this thesis it was \nknown that there where several issues with the quality of the data from the southern \nhemisphere. Namely, a complicated wobble developed along the spin axis of the \nIMAGE spacecraft which was hard to characterise such that the error in the camera \npointing direction was increased. It is believed that this wobble may cause the auroral \noval to be apparently displaced by up to 1\u00b0 from its true location. This would \nsignificantly change the values of Fpc returned from these images. The pointing for \nthese months has since been improved and the extension of this work to the southern \nhemisphere may be possible. \n \nTo date, very few conjugate studies of the northern and southern auroral ovals have \nbeen possible due to the very limited number of conjugate observations made by \nimaging spacecraft. However, the few studies which have been carried out have shown \nthat there can be significant differences in the aurora and onset location of substorms in \nthe two hemispheres (e.g. \u00d8stgaard et al., 2006). The IMAGE spacecraft is, in general, \nonly able to image the aurora of one hemisphere at any one time and thus conjugate \nstudies are not possible. The proposed KuaFu mission (Tu et al., 2007) will consist of \ntwo auroral imagers on separate spacecraft, allowing the simultaneous observation of \nboth southern and northern FUV auroral ovals. Application of the methods described in \nthis thesis to auroral images from KuaFu, or similar future missions, would allow the \nopen magnetic flux evolution and auroral dynamics during substorms to be compared \nbetween hemispheres. \n \nIn chapters 5 and 6 of this thesis we have defined three distinct categories of substorms \ndepending on their particle injection signatures. The apparent relation between substorm \ninjection signatures and the level and type of solar wind driving is a new and \nunexpected result. Further investigation of these categories (for example investigating \nthe tail magnetic field morphology during these events) may provide important insights \ninto the substorm and particle injection processes. \n 119\nReferences \n \nAbel, G.
