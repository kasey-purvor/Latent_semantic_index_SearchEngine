As part of this, many European countries have \ndeveloped an ecological quality classification scheme for chlorophyll concentrations as a \nmeasure of phytoplankton abundance.  The assessment of ecological quality must be based \non the degree of divergence of a water body from an appropriate baseline, or \u2018reference \ncondition\u2019.  It is, therefore, necessary to determine chlorophyll reference conditions for all \nEuropean lake types.  This involves examining how chlorophyll concentrations vary by \nlake type, in the absence of any nutrient pressures from agriculture or wastewater. \nFor this purpose, a dataset of 540 European lakes considered to be in a relatively \nundisturbed reference condition has been assembled, including data on chlorophyll \nconcentration, altitude, mean depth, alkalinity, humic content, surface area, and \ngeographical region. \nChlorophyll was found to vary with lake type and geographical region, and was \nfound to be naturally highest in low-altitude, very shallow, high alkalinity and humic lake \ntypes and naturally lowest in clear, deep, low alkalinity lakes.  The results suggest that light \nand mineral availability are important drivers of chlorophyll concentrations in undisturbed \nlakes. \nDescriptive statistics (median and percentiles) of chlorophyll concentrations were \ncalculated from populations of lakes in this reference lake dataset and used to derive lake-\ntype specific reference chlorophyll concentrations.  These reference conditions can be \napplied, through a comparison with observed chlorophyll concentrations at a site, in the \nassessments of ecological status and provide a consistent baseline to adopt for European \ncountries.  \n2 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nIntroduction \n \nThe use of chlorophyll concentrations as a general measure of lake water quality is widely \nadopted around the world. Yet there has been very little scientific research examining how \nchlorophyll concentrations vary naturally, in the absence of nutrient pressures. The \nEuropean Directive 2000\/60\/EC, commonly referred to as the Water Framework Directive \n(WFD), challenges this lack of understanding.  The WFD prescribes the assessment of \necological quality of surface waters using an Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR). The EQR is \ndefined as the relationship between the current observed value and the reference condition \nvalue for a given ecological quality element. Reference conditions are a state corresponding \nto very low pressure, with only minimal human impacts from industrialisation, urbanisation \nand intensive agriculture.  Reference conditions differ across Europe resulting from \ngeographical differences of catchments (geology and altitude) and lake factors (e.g. depth, \narea, water colour). To account for these differences, the WFD requires water bodies to be \ndifferentiated into \u2018ecotypes\u2019 within geographical regions and to derive type-specific \nreference conditions for the appropriate ecological quality elements. \n \nAs part of the assessment of ecological quality, many European countries have chosen \nchlorophyll concentrations as a part of the ecological quality element phytoplankton.  A \nlarge scale formal assessment of the comparability of national assessment schemes is also \nbeing carried out as part of the implementation of the WFD - a process known as \nIntercalibration.  Chlorophyll has been selected as a key parameter for this Intercalibration \nprocess for lakes because of its recognition as a good general measure of ecological impact \nof eutrophication and because data are widely available.  It is, therefore, essential to \ndetermine chlorophyll reference conditions for all WFD European lake types. The WFD \n3 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nrequirement to define type-specific reference conditions, therefore, makes this analysis of \nthe factors determining chlorophyll concentrations in the absence of nutrient pressure (i.e. \nreference conditions), of high topical interest to both freshwater scientists and policy \nmakers across Europe. \n \nA number of approaches can be used to establish reference conditions and these have been \nbroadly summarised in the published guidance on reference conditions for the WFD \n(REFCOND Guidance, 2003).  This outlines five general approaches available for defining \nchlorophyll reference conditions: \n1. Survey data from a population of reference or minimally impacted lakes \n2. Model-based prediction \n3. Palaeolimnology \n4. Historical data \n5. Expert judgement \n \nThe EC guidance (REFCEOND, 2003) suggests that approach no. 1, a validated \nspatial network of reference or minimally impacted lakes is preferred.  For this study, we \ncollated data from >500 European reference lakes (Moe et al. 2008, this issue).  We aim to \nuse this large dataset to estimate type-specific chlorophyll reference conditions for many \nIntercalibration lake types (see Van de Bund et al, 2004). These reference conditions can be \napplied, through a comparison with observed chlorophyll concentrations at a site, in the \nassessments of ecological status for WFD purposes and we hope may provide consistent \nbaseline measures for European Member States to adopt.  By examining chlorophyll \nconcentrations in such a large data set of undisturbed lakes, we also aim to describe the \n4 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nfactors that determine natural, background concentrations of chlorophyll in the absence of \nnutrient pressure, a topic of high topical interest to freshwater scientists in general. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nCriteria for reference lake selection \nIn order to guarantee a common understanding of a reference lake, a common view of what \nis accepted as a minor degree of change in the natural conditions was necessary.  As part of \nthe WFD Common Implementation Strategy, Geographical Intercalibration Groups (GIGs) \nhave been created (see Van de Bund et al, 2004). There are five lake GIG regions \n(Northern, Central-Baltic, Atlantic, Alpine, and Mediterranean). Each regional GIG has \ndeveloped a list of criteria for the selection of reference lakes, using a range of pressure \ncriteria such as a low % of intensive agriculture, absence of major point sources in \ncatchment and low population density (Table 1).  Despite some differences in specific \nvalues for each pressure criterion between GIGs, and even individual countries, all follow \nthe REFCOND guidelines in general, that very little industrialization, intensive \nurbanization or agriculture should be present in the catchment (Anonymous, 2003).  Three \nMember States (UK, Ireland, Austria) have also used palaeolimnology to validate choice of \nreference lakes \u2013 only selecting sites that show no significant change in diatom sub-fossil \nassemblages over the last 150 years or more (see Bennion et al., 2004 for more details). \n \nMany countries additionally used expert judgement in the review of final site lists.  Some \ncountries selected sites that locally may be considered in very good condition biologically, \nbut had high nutrient concentrations compared with lakes of a similar type in other \ncountries.  For this reason a threshold mean TP concentration of 100 \u00b5g l-1 was used as a \nfurther criterion, above which sites were removed from this analysis.  This resulted in 5 \n5 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nsites, all actually having TP concentrations >150\u00b5g l-1, being excluded out of a total of 545 \nsites (i.e. <1%).  The TP concentrations in the remaining dataset of 540 reference lakes \nwere all lower than 70 \u00b5g l-1, with only three sites having concentrations >50 \u00b5g l-1. \n \nThe final dataset highlights a significantly higher number of reference lakes from the \nNorthern GIG than all other GIGs (Table 2).  This is probably a true representation of the \nfact that these other regions are generally more impacted by higher population densities, \nindustry and more intensive agriculture. \n \nData \nData from reference lakes were collated on chlorophyll concentration, altitude, surface area, \nmean depth, alkalinity, humic content, and GIG region.  These data were gathered from \nnational datasets from individual Member States through partners in the EC REBECCA \nProject (see http:\/\/www.environment.fi\/syke\/rebecca) and from the GIG coordinators (see \nMoe et al., this issue for details). \n \nInevitably with such a large dataset of lakes from many countries there are questions over \nthe quality of the data.  To minimise noise in the dataset, lakes were only included in the \nanalysis if they had three or more samples from different months between the period April \nto September (a \u2018growing period\u2019 in all lakes in the dataset).  If data from several years \nwere provided for an individual lake, these growth season means were averaged over the \nyears.  If data from several sites within a lake were provided (particularly an issue with \nFinnish lakes), these site means were averaged to give a whole lake mean, to ensure no bias \nwas given to any particular lake. \n \n6 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nStatistical analysis \nTo derive type-specific reference chlorophyll concentrations, descriptive statistics were \nproduced for chlorophyll by each lake type. As the dataset of reference lakes was carefully \nselected using relatively strict and consistent environmental and other pressure criteria, \ntype-specific reference conditions should represent chlorophyll concentrations in all \nreference lakes within a type.  A statistic representing average conditions was, therefore, \nconsidered more appropriate than an extreme percentile.  The median statistic was chosen \nin preference to the mean as it is less affected by possible outliers in the dataset. This was \nconsidered relevant as some reference sites may have fitted within the pressure criteria but \nmay still be impacted by local or undocumented nutrient pressures.  \nStandard deviations of medians and percentiles were obtained by a bootstrapping procedure \n(Maindonald & Braun, 2007), which resampled with replacement the original dataset, \nestimating the median and percentile statistics and the resulting standard deviations. \nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the mean chlorophyll concentration \namong GIG regions, GIG types and Member States.  \n \nIf reference conditions were based on a lower quartile statistic of the chlorophyll data in \nreference sites, the reference condition established would not then be met by most reference \nlakes.  A high percentile statistic of the chlorophyll data, such as the 75th or 90th percentile, \nis, however, potentially a suitable measure for defining the high\/good status class boundary \nas this would mean that, appropriately, a high proportion of reference lakes would be \nclassified as high status.  Analysis of type-specific values was only carried out for those \nlake types from which data existed from 4 or more lakes (Table 3). \n \n \n7 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nResults \n \nReference Conditions by GIG types and GIG region \nOf the 540 reference lakes for which chlorophyll data for the growth season are available, \n335 can be assigned to a specific GIG type.  Of these, 13 GIG types have sufficient data (\u22654 \nsites) for estimating reference chlorophyll conditions (median values) and potential \nhigh\/good boundary values (75th or 90th percentiles).  Minimum and maximum reference \nchlorophyll values for individual lakes ranged between 0.3 and 38.0 \u00b5g l-1.  Type-specific \nreference conditions generally ranged between 2.0 and 7.0 \u00b5g l-1 except for L-N3b, the \nNorthern GIG polyhumic lake type, which had a much higher value (14 \u00b5g l-1) (Table 4). \n \nFor most lake types in the Northern GIG, the median chlorophyll values of humic (L-N3a, \nL-N3b, L-N6a and L-N8a) and non-humic (L-N1, L-N2a, L-N2b and L-N5) clearly differ: \nlake types (ANOVA, p<0.01), with the former all >3 \u00b5g l-1 and the latter all <3 \u00b5g l-1.  Of \nthe non-humic lakes, highest chlorophyll concentrations were recorded in moderately \nalkaline lakes (L-N1; ANOVA, p<0.01), and lowest concentrations in other low alkalinity \nlake types. The lowest chlorophyll concentration was observed in L-N5 and was \nsignificantly lower than the others (ANOVA, p<0.05). In the non-humic lakes, chlorophyll \nconcentrations were also greater in shallow low alkalinity lakes (L-N2a) than in deep low \nalkalinity lakes (L-N2b) although this was not statistically significant. In humic lakes of the \nNordic GIG, median chlorophyll values were more heterogeneous (L-N3a differed from L-\nN3b and L-N8a, L-N3b from L-N6a; ANOVA, p<0.05).  \n \nMedian values for Central-Baltic GIG lake types were higher than those for Northern GIG \nlake types (ANOVA, p<0.01), even for L-CB3 which is an equivalent lake type to L-N1 \n8 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \n(median values of 4.8 \u00b5g l-1 and 2.9 \u00b5g l-1 respectively), although the data from these two \nlake types did not significantly differ (p=0.09). Chlorophyll values did not differ \nsignificantly between Central-Baltic lake types (ANOVA, p = 0.39).  \n \nThe Central-Baltic GIG lake type L-CB1 is  the same as the Atlantic GIG type L-A2 \n(lowland, shallow, high alkalinity).  Both median and 75th percentile values were similar \nand were not significantly different (p=0.73). \n \nIn summary, chlorophyll reference conditions differed by humic content, depth type and \nalkalinity type.  They were lowest in deep and clear water low alkalinity lake types, and \nconversely, highest for very shallow, high alkalinity and humic lake types. \n \n \nComparison of Reference Conditions by Member States \nFor a few Northern GIG lake types, there were sufficient data to compare median reference \nconditions across Member States for the same lake type.  This is illustrated for non-humic \nand humic lake types in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.  This reveals that there was \nreasonable consistency for reference chlorophyll values between Northern GIG countries. \nIn the clear water lake types L-N1 and L-N2a, median values for Norway were significantly \nlower than the others (ANOVA, p<0.05). In humic lake types, Finnish lakes had \nconsistently higher median values (ANOVA, p<0.05) and consistently greater variability \n(Fig. 2). The bias in numbers of reference lakes from Norway and Finland could skew the \nstatistics for Northern lake types.  For clear water lake types (L-N2a and L-N2b), where \nSweden and the UK had reasonable representation there was no evidence of bias (Figure 1).  \nBias is more in evidence for humic lake types (L-N3b, L-N6a and L-N8a) where the UK \n9 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nand Norway had very limited representation and different median statistics from Finland \n(Fig 2).   For this lake type, Member States may want to consider whether national targets \nare more appropriate with current data availability. \n \nDiscussion \nDifferences between GIG types \nThe collation of the data highlighted that reference chlorophyll concentrations can \npotentially span quite a large range across all GIG types, although values were frequently \nless than 4 \u00b5g l-1 and generally lower than 7 \u00b5g l-1.  The humic and non-humic lake types \ndiffered clearly, in particular the polyhumic lake type L-N3b which had a much higher \nmedian value than any other lake type.  Analysis of total phosphorus concentrations in \nhumic reference lakes (Cardoso et al., 2007) has highlighted that nutrient concentrations are \nconsistently higher, and it is plausible that these are simply a response to these higher \nnutrient concentrations.  Some studies of humic lakes support these findings (N\u00fcrnberg & \nShaw, 1999), whilst others suggest the opposite is true \u2013 lower phytoplankton production in \nhumic lakes associated with the low light availability and low concentrations of nutrients \nthat are readily bio-available (M\u00fcnster, 1999).  The results observed in this study for humic \nlake types are based largely on data from Finnish lakes (14 out of 16 sites for L-N3b). They \ncould, therefore, be due to sampling or analytical biases or real biogeographical or \necological differences in Finland (see later discussion on Member States differences).  A \nwide number of Boreal lake surveys across Finland have reported that phytoplankton \nbiomass is generally lower in clear water lakes, although within meso- or poly-humic lakes \nthe relationship between water colour and phytoplankton biomass is more variable (Arvola \net al., 1999). \n10 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \n \nConsistent patterns were also recorded with chlorophyll concentrations increasing with \ndecreasing depth class, with all other typology variables remaining equal.  For example, \nthis pattern is observed when comparing L-N2b (deep) vs L-N2a (shallow) and L-CB1 \n(shallow) vs L-CB2 (very shallow) lake types.  These differences were, however, relatively \nsmall and not statistically significant. Higher chlorophyll concentrations would be expected \nwith decreasing depth class reflecting the well established positive relationships between \nalgal biomass and light availability (Scheffer, 1998).  Less consistent was the pattern with \nalkalinity type. Shallow, moderate alkalinity lakes (L-N1) did have significantly higher \nmedian chlorophyll concentrations than equivalent low alkalinity lakes (L-N2a and L-N5), \nbut the shallow high alkalinity lake type (L-CB1) had concentrations that were not \nsignificantly different from an equivalent moderate alkalinity type (L-N1).  The latter \nfinding was surprising, as it is well established that background nutrient availability is \ngenerally greater with increasing alkalinity (Dillon & Kirchner 1975; Vighi & Chaudani \n1985; Cardoso et al., 2007).  One possible explanation for the low chlorophyll \nconcentrations in the high alkalinity lake type is that, as undisturbed lakes of this type are \nrarer, expert judgement may have been used more widely to select reference lakes. This \nmay have led to the mistaken exclusion of sites with naturally higher phosphorus and \nchlorophyll concentrations. \n \nDifferences between GIG regions and Member States \nThe fact that there were no statistically significant differences in reference conditions for \nthe same lake types in different GIG regions is encouraging and suggests that the criteria \nfor reference lake selection between different GIGs were more or less consistent, and that \n11 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nthere are no region-specific differences in reference chlorophyll, at least within Northern \nand Central Europe. \n \nThe analysis revealed that reference conditions in most countries were relatively \ncomparable for a particular GIG lake type.  There did, however, appear to be consistent \ndifferences across humic lake types for different countries in the Northern GIG with \nFinland consistently higher than Norway. Explanations involving different criteria for \nselection of reference lakes or different sampling and analytical methods were discounted \nfollowing checks with national representatives across Scandinavia, which indicated very \nconsistent approaches.  It may, therefore, highlight real biogeographical or ecological \ndifferences between Finnish humic lakes and those in other Northern European countries. \nThe greater variability in chlorophyll concentrations in Finnish humic lakes may be a true \nreflection of the greater humic gradients present in Finland, which contributed the bulk of \nthe humic sites.  In very humic waters, higher chlorophyll concentrations could be a \nresponse to phytoplankton becoming adapted to the low light availability by producing \nmore chlorophyll per unit biomass or simply due to the known compositional shifts to large \nmixotrophic species, such as Gonyostomum, that are known to occur (Arvola et al, 1999; \nSalonen et al, 2002). \n \nOne country in the Central-Baltic GIG had all its reference lakes excluded from the analysis \non the basis of TP concentrations >150 \u00b5g\/l.  This highlights the fact that differences can \nexist between how countries select reference lakes.  Although these sites did have \nindications of a high ecological status based on diverse macrophyte communities, their \nnutrient pressures exceeded the WFD recommended guideline,and so were rejected as \nreference lakes for analysis of reference chlorophyll conditions. \n12 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \n \n \nGeneral Issues \nThe analysis has led to statistically robust, WFD-compliant chlorophyll reference \nconditions for many European Intercalibration lake types. It has also highlighted that there \nappears to be generally very good consistency between Member States and GIG regions in \nthe criteria used to select reference sites in relation to nutrient pressures. \n \nThere are clear differences in chlorophyll reference conditions between lake types with \nincreasing concentrations associated with increasing water colour and decreasing depth; No \nsingle fixed value for chlorophyll reference conditions is, therefore, appropriate across all \nlake types.  The analysis does, however, highlight that even type-specific reference \nchlorophyll concentrations may not be ideal as the effects of certain factors such as water \ncolour and depth are really continuous, rather than abrupt differences between types.  Sites \nthat lie close to type boundaries may, therefore, be poorly represented and lead to large \nerrors in any type-specific, reference-based status assessment.  Site-specific reference \nconditions may, therefore, be ecologically more appropriate and could be developed by \nestablishing empirical regression models using the raw typology data available from the \nlakes used in this study (c.f. MEI model: Vighi & Chiaudani, 1985).  Another advantage of \ndeveloping site-specific regression models is that reference conditions could be established \nfor lakes that do not fall strictly into the Intercalibration lake types reported here. \n \n13 \nREBECCA MS no. 02 \nAcknowledgements \nThis study was part-financed by the European Framework 6 Project REBECCA \n\u2018Relationships Between Ecological and Chemical Status of Surface Waters\u2019, Contract No.: \nSSPI-CT-2003-502158.
