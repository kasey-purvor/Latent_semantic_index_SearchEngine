INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION\nAs the development of lasers continues to produce stron-\nger and stronger fields, we can now study high-field-matter\ninteractions in the laboratory, where the common theoretical\ntechniques of nonlinear optics and perturbative field expan-\nsions break down. Indeed, it is now well established that the\nextremely-high-field physics of atomic ensembles presents\nmany fascinating phenomena whereby the response of matter\nto high fields cannot be described within perturbation theory.\nFor example, the process of high-harmonic generation\n~HHG! due to an intense atom-field interaction has received\nsubstantial attention in recent years,1 and harmonically gen-\nerated coherent x-ray transients as short as 100 attoseconds\nhave been predicted and indeed are beginning to be\nobserved.2 The theoretical problem of HHG is most tactfully\ntreated nonperturbatively by exploring the wave-packet\n~WP! motion by essentially exact numerical methods. For\nRydberg atoms, higher-frequency harmonics are produced\nfrom continuum-state to bound-state transitions, in which\nelectrons release the energy absorbed from the field during\ntheir journey in the continuum.\nIn certain limits there is a one-to-one mapping between\nthe theoretical description of atoms and excitons\u2014\nCoulombically bound electron-hole (e-h) pairs in solids\nanalogous to hydrogen. That said, the bound-state binding\nenergies are substantially different. While the bound-state to\ncontinuum-state transitions in atoms are typically in the eV\nregime, in semiconductors these transitions are usually in the\nmeV terahertz ~THz! regime. Nevertheless, with an increase\nin scientific research that utilizes free-electron lasers as well\nas THz solid-state emitters, high-field THz and mid-infrared\n~MIR! spectroscopy is now timely entering similar extreme\nregimes for semiconductors.3,4 However, the frequencies and\nfield strengths ~and thus ponderomotive energies! required\nare several orders of magnitude apart. For this reason, high-\nfield effects in semiconductors can be observed at field in-\ntensities many orders of magnitude below what is required\nfor the atoms.\nThe aim of this work is to employ a standard space-time\nmethod used frequently in electromagnetic simulation, and\napply it to study semiconductor WP dynamics in the pres-0163-1829\/2004\/69~20!\/205308~6!\/$22.50 69 2053ence of extreme fields\u2014electric and ~or! magnetic ~dynamic\nand static!. The advantages over previous techniques are\nmany and will be discussed later. We will focus on e-h WP\u2019s\nthat are dynamically created by resonantly exciting a semi-\nconductor with a short ~but finite! optical pulse. The pulse\nintensity is weak and thus we work in the linear regime for\nthe optical field, but all other fields will be treated nonper-\nturbatively. This enables us to work in the low-density limit\nwhere many-body effects do not come into play. In the pres-\nence of large THz, static, or ~and! magnetic fields one can\nexplore WP motion and experimental observables that are\nunique to the semiconductor environment. Moreover, semi-\nconductor studies in the extreme-field regime, although rela-\ntively new, offer several advantages over atomic environ-\nments including the ability to change the effective masses\nand dimensionalities of the system.\nAt the outset, we emphasize that electro-absorption stud-\nies in semiconductors are certainly not new. The influence of\na strong constant electric field F on the optical and electronic\nproperties of semiconductors was introduced over 40 years\nago, beginning with the Franz-Keldysh effect in bulk\ncrystals.5 For two-dimensional ~2D! semiconductors, such as\nquantum wells ~QW\u2019s!,6 similar effects occur for a field po-\nlarized in the plane, while the quantum-confined Stark effect\noccurs for fields polarized in the growth direction. In 1D, the\nFranz-Keldysh effect was only investigated recently.7\nHowever, in the last few years there has been much inter-\nest in extending the semiconductor electro-optical studies\ninto the dynamic, THz, regime. Besides being of fundamen-\ntal interest, as highlighted above there are some very close\nanalogies with high-field effects in atoms, though this con-\nnection is rarely made in the literature. From a theoretical\nperspective, several approaches have been introduced,\nnamely, Green function8 and nonequilibrium Green-function\ntechniques9 ~both restricted in their handling of excitons and\ndynamics!, as well as full scale numerical solution of the\nsemiconductor Bloch equations ~SBE! in momentum\nspace.10 With regard to modeling high magnetic field inter-\nactions, usually one has to resort to a specialized basis set or\n~and! treat the Coulomb interaction perturbatively. In this\nwork we set about solving the problem using a real-space\nand real time technique, specialized in the low-density re-\ngime ~as in the above cases!. The method ~i! includes the\u00a92004 The American Physical Society08-1\nS. HUGHES PHYSICAL REVIEW B 69, 205308 ~2004!fields ~THz and magnetic! and the Coulomb interactions\nnonperturbatively, ~ii! is an order of magnitude faster than\nthe SBE even when the latter excludes the magnetic field,\nand ~iii! provides full spatial information thus providing a\nnice link with transport and optical properties. We will con-\ncentrate on QW\u2019s, where the technique can be immediately\napplied to recent free-electron laser studies and manipulation\nof excitonic states\u2014recovering the dynamic Franz-Keldysh\neffect;3,10 the technique can, however, be applied to wells,\ndots, and bulk semiconductor materials. For the QW study,\nwe also model magnetoexcitons and electro-magneto-\nexcitons and explore their WP motion. The present theoreti-\ncal understanding of semiconductor optical processes in\nlarge magnetic fields is still fairly limited since including the\nCoulomb interaction is very difficult if one works in energy\nspace; besides side stepping this problem, moreover, we\nshow that in the presence of crossed magnetic and THz\nfields, WP stabilization can occur, just like in atomic physics\nexperiments. Finally, we will explore extreme high-\nfrequency induced sidebands that show good trends with re-\ncent MIR experiments,4 and give our conclusions.\nII. THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL METHOD\nHigh-field effects in atoms can be investigated nonpertur-\nbatively by numerically solving an effective Scho\u00a8dinger\nequation ~in excitonic units!:\ni\n]C~r,t !\n]t\n5@2\u201er\n22V~r!1F~ t !\u0095r#C~r,t !, ~1!\nwhere r is the spatial position, C(r,t) is the WP, F(t) is the\noscillating electric field, and V is the Coulomb potential. On\nthe other hand, semiconductor optical problems are usually\ntackled within the framework of the SBE.11,12 In the low-\ndensity regime, this leads to the following set of equations\nfor the polarization only:\n]Pk~ t !\n]t\n52FTHz~ t !\u0095\u201ek2Pk2iDkPk~ t !1iVk2GPk , ~2!\nwhere Dk5Ek2v l1Eg , Eg is the band gap, v l is the carrier\nfrequency of the optical pulse, and FTHz is the applied THz\nfield that can be polarized in any direction ~see below!. The\ngeneralized Rabi frequency is Vk5dcv\u00ab\u02dcOpt1(qVk2qPq ,\nwhere \u00ab\u02dcOpt(t) is the slowly varying optical field polarized\nalso in the QW plane, Vq is the Coulomb potential in mo-\nmentum ~i.e., k) space, and the total dephasing rate of the\noptical polarization G5500 fs21 throughout; this is expected\nto be valid provided the input optical pulse is weak, which it\nis for this study. The solution of the SBE can then be solved\nin k space, and the total optical polarization is POpt(t)\n52(kdcvPk(t), where dcv is the interband dipole moment\nand the factor of 2 account for spin. However, we do not\nlearn anything about the spatial dynamics, namely, P(r\n\u00de0,t); additionally, the k equations are extremely difficult to\nsolve with the THz field since the components become an-\nisotropic requiring a major computational effort. Indeed, the\nsolution with the THz field alone was reported only fairly20530recently,10 and takes many days to simulate even with pow-\nerful computers. With the possible addition of a magnetic\nfield, the numerical problem becomes intractable, requiring a\nswitch to a large number of Landau basis states with some\nperturbation approximations.11 Thus a real-space approach is\ncertainly more natural. We further highlight that the pioneer-\ning work of Schmitt-Rink and co-workers on the semicon-\nductor Stark effect also approached the problem from the\nreal-space perspective, essentially solving the stationary\nSchro\u00a8dinger equation.6\nAssuming on-resonance excitation ~zero detuning! we can\nrewrite Eq. ~2! in real space\ni\n]P~r,t !\n]t\n5@2\u201er\n21r\u0095FTHz~ t !2iG#P~r,t !2V~r!P~r,t !\n1V~ t !d~r!, ~3!\nwhere P(r,t) is the e-h WP, and r5re2rh . A displacement\nof the WP from r50 means it is polarized, and thus the THz\nfield will create an oscillating dipole. The optical polariza-\ntion is now POpt(t)52dcvP(r50,t). We have also killed two\nbirds with the one stone since the WP approach gives us\nsimultaneous optical and THz information. The THz-induced\nintraband dipole moment PTHz(t)5e*drP*(r,t)rP(r,t), and\nfor the emitted THz electric field\u2014assuming a point\nsource\u2014ETHz(t)}P\u00a8 THz(t). The structure of the above equa-\ntion is very similar to the atomic problem but we have\ndephasing and an optical pulse; therefore the e-h WP is cre-\nated dynamically and relaxes dynamically ~dephases!. In the\npresence of a magnetic field B terms such as the momentum\noperator (px25@ i]\/]x#2) are replaced by (px1eAx \/c)2 ~Ref.\n11! and do not pose any further refinements on the compu-\ntational technique, which will be discussed in more detail\nbelow; relativistic correction terms can also be added. Thus,\nwhether one studies free carriers, excitons, THz field ioniza-\ntion, or magnetic-field effects, the computational technique is\nthe same. This is in stark contrast to the k-space approach\nwhere the numerics become increasingly more difficult with\nthe various fields. We do point out that the k space is, how-\never, much better suited to high density and nonlinear optical\nstudies, but intractable with large electric and magnetic\nfields.\nOur numerical strategy is based on an exploitation of the\nfinite-difference time-domain ~FDTD!13,14 method; in the re-\ngime of complex electromagnetic scattering problems,\nFDTD has recently became the state-of-the-art computa-\ntional method for solving Maxwell\u2019s equations almost ex-\nactly. Essentially we replace the polarization equation by\nfinite-difference approximations, and implement them on a\ncomputational cell such as the Yee cell13 used in electrody-\nnamics; an example of doing this for the 1D atomic problem\n~Schro\u00a8dinger equation! is given in Ref. 14. For our present\npurpose, things are a little more complicated. To handle the\nfs optical-field source, we approximate the Dirac d function\nby narrow normalized Gaussian and the numerical accuracy\nis verified to be in excellent agreement with the k-space ap-\nproach in obtaining the quantitative excitonic and continuum8-2\nHIGH-FIELD WAVE PACKETS IN SEMICONDUCTOR . . .

We will also drop the vector no-20530tation on the WP (P5P) and assuming an x-polarized THz\nfield. Labeling the time t, and x and y spatial steps by n, l,\nand m, we can write out the WP FDTD difference equations\ncorresponding to Eq. ~3! asP (n ,l ,m)\nR 2P (n21,l ,m)\nR\nDt\n52\nvx@P (n20.5,l11,m)\nI 22P (n20.5,l ,m)\nI 1P (n20.5,l21,m)\nI #\n@Dx#2\n2\nvx@P (n20.5,l ,m11)\nI 22P (n20.5,l ,m)\nI 1P (n20.5,l ,m21)\nI #\n@Dy #2\n2x\u0095ETHz~ t !P (n20.5,l ,m)I 1\nvx\n2~ uru1as!\nP (n20.5,l ,m)\nI 2P (n21,l ,m)\nR G , ~4!\nand\nP (n10.5,l ,m)\nI 2P (n20.5,l ,m)\nI\nDt\n5\nvx@P (n ,l11,m)\nR 22P (n ,l ,m)\nR 1P (n ,l21,m)\nR #\n@Dx#2\n1\nvx@P (n ,l ,m11)\nR 22P (n ,l ,m)\nR 1P (n ,l ,m21)\nR #\n@Dy #2\n1x\u0095ETHz~ t !P (n ,l ,m)R 2\nvx\n2~ uru1as!\nP (n ,l ,m)\nR 2P (n20.5,l ,m)\nI G1\nV~ t !\n2pad\nexpF2 r\nad\nG , ~5!where all spatial units are given in terms of the Bohr radius,\na0, and vx is the (1s) lowest state exciton binding fre-\nquency. The factor of 0.5 appearing in the time and spatial\nmeshing ~i.e., n20.5, n21, etc.! is consistent with the E\nand H field being displaced by half a time step and half a\ngrid cell for regular electromagnetic FDTD.13,14 The numeri-\ncally chosen parameters for the d function and Coulombic\nscreening are given by ad and as , which are both taken to be\n0.3a0. These parameters are needed to stop numerical diver-\ngence, but we highlight two important points: ~1! as long as\nad is small enough, the resulting spectra to be investigated\nbelow remain the same, and ~2! as physically corresponds to\nhaving a finite thickness quantum well, and thus is chosen to\nyield similar values to experimental spectra. For example, by\nincluding a realistic value we obtain the fundamental exciton\nbinding energy of the QW that is about 2\u20133 times the bulk\nvalue, which is much closer to experimental values than the\n2D quantum limit ~four times the bulk!. Furthermore, little\nquantitative changes take place by adjusting these parameters\nslightly. With regard to what time step to choose, we use the\nformula dt5S@Dx#2\/vx , with Dx5Dy , and S is the scaling\nfactor to ensure numerical convergence. For all the tests be-\nlow S was set to 10, though it can certainly be much smaller\nthan this if less intense fields are applied, and we choose a\ntotal number of x and y points equal to 241, on a regular\nspatial grid than span the range 636a0. Finally, we note that\nit trivial and straightforward to add additional fields in the\nabove FDTD equations, such as a magnetic field or other\nstatic-time-dependent fields. This is a clear advantage over\nfast Fourier transform split-step real-space methods com-\nmonly employed in high-field atomic optics.1\nTo this end, we work in the symmetric Gauge when mag-netic fields are applied, and focus attention here to a two-\nsubband semiconductor QW excited by a short 50 fs optical\npulse where the center of the pulse corresponds to time t\n50 fs. We take material parameters typical of InGaAs\/GaAs\nwith a bulk exciton binding energy E054.2 meV, and Bohr\nradius a0514 nm.\nIII.

And ~d!, as in ~a! but with a mixed B THz applied with\nidentical parameters as above.\nIn Fig. 1 we show a snap shot of the corresponding WP\u2019s\nat t51.8 ps after the short pulse has gone. uP(r,t)u is a mea-\nsure of the probability of finding electron and hole at posi-\ntion r at time t. Initially the WP is created at r50 to satisfy\nenergy and momentum requirements of a direct gap semicon-\nductor; note that much larger spatial regions are accounted\nfor computationally. In ~a! the WP is concentrated near the\ncenter due to the Coulomb interaction, since there is a high\nprobability of finding the electron and hole at the same rela-8-3\nS.

Shows\na unique spiraling interfering WP due to the combined THz\nand B fields.\nTo link the WP motion to familiar optical properties, we\nsimply Fourier transform the WP at r50 to the frequency\ndomain and divide its imaginary contribution by the input\noptical pulse ~via the Maxwell equations!. In Fig. 2~a! we\nobtain the familiar field-free absorption spectrum for a QW,\nnamely, a strong 1s exciton resonance and a Coulombically\nenhanced continuum; in the presence of a THz field we ob-\ntain the dynamic Franz-Keldysh effect with oscillations\nabove the band gap.3 Note that we have calculated the phase\naveraged WP results and thus the graphs represent the true\nabsorption. Different phases, in principle, can coherently\ncontrol the WP\u2019s motion, and phase effects are fully incor-\nporated within our formalism. In Fig. 2~b! we obtain Landau\noscillations and an enhancement of the lowest lying exciton.\nFor clarity, (B induced! diamagnetic shift terms of the band\ngap are not shown, though will depend on the helicity ~spin\ndependent! of the optical light pulse, since E6\ng 5E0\ng7m0\nwhere m0 is the Bohr magnetron. To further highlight our\ntechnique with larger fields, we also employ a 12 meV Lan-\ndau frequency, polarized, as before, in the growth direction.\nSubstantial magnetoexcitons are seen in the inset, with peaks\nseparated by the Landau frequency. These recover the known\nsolution that employs many basis states in energy space,11\nbut without restrictions of perturbation theory, working with\ncomplicated basis states, and continuous wave ~CW! excita-\ntion. We also obtain the mixed B-THz-field scenario result-\ning in interference between magnetoexcitons ~Landau levels!\nFIG. 1.

The\nspatial dimensions are given in units of the exciton Bohr radius.20530and nonlinear THz interactions, shown in Fig. 2~c!. In Fig.\n2~d! we obtain the emitted THz field ~from the oscillating\ndipole! in the presence of the THz driving field; a rich vari-\nety of harmonics akin to HHG in atoms appears. In the\nmixed field case we obtain an intriguing magnetic-THz cou-\npling regime. The resolved peaks correspond to the absorp-\ntion of one optical photon and the absorption ~or emission!\nof one or more THz photons. Interestingly the harmonics are\nsuppressed when we add a magnetic field since WP stabili-\nzation occurs for longer times; this effect is consistent with\nthe Green-function prediction;15 all the physics can be ex-\nplained from the WP\u2019s internal motion: the mixed-field WP\nis less distorted, and can be stabilized due to the forced Lan-\ndau orbits and subsequently reduces exciton ionization ~i.e.,\nthe WP propagating away from r50).\nNext, we remove the time dependence of the oscillating\nTHz field, i.e., F5F0n\u02c6 x , thus working in the regime of the\nFranz-Keldysh effect. However, in addition we add a mag-\nnetic field in the growth direction. In Fig. 3~a! we show an\nexample of the WP at time t51 ps. In this case, there is no\nlonger a forced oscillating dipole though the WP is undergo-\ning B-field spiraling and e-h ionization through the applied\ndc field. The corresponding absorption is shown in Fig. 3~b!,\ndemonstrating pronounced exciton ionization and mixed\nFranz-Keldysh magnetoexciton features. We note that the\nemitted THz field, shows no clear peaks beyond the dc signal\nwhich is due to the fact that the static electric field is domi-\nnating the WP motion.\nFinally, we present an example of extreme high-frequency\nTHz optics by using a 5 THz field with a 100 kV\/cm ampli-\ntude. We have also tried such a simulation using a momen-\ntum space approach and it is intractable, yet the present\nmethod solved the problem in about 10\u201320 min on a stan-\nFIG. 2.

As an inset we show the emitted dipole field.20530regimes in a very intuitive way. While the basic FDTD\nmethod is well known in the electromagnetic simulation\nfield, it has not yet been applied to the complex problems\nthat we address in this study, namely, high-field wave pack-\nets in semiconductors. The technique is shown to easily in-\ncorporate a variety of fields, such as Coulomb, magnetic,\nTHz, static\u2014all included exactly, in the low-density limit.\nFurthermore, the technique is apparently much more efficient\nand powerful than other techniques such as k-space SBE and\nnonequilibrium Green-function techniques, which only\ntackle a subset of what we have demonstrated here. Thus we\nanticipate that this method will, and should, be applied to\nstudy many areas of high-field physics, ranging from HHG\nin semiconductors and atoms to the coherent control of e-h\nwave packets using magnets. Experimental observables are\nalso easily extracted with the present FDTD method, and\nseveral examples for semiconductor quantum wells were\nshown to be in qualitative agreement with high-field experi-\nments.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nDiscussions from D.
