As\ndressing is uninterrupted, an effective wheel surface\nof sharp protruding abrasives is continually main-\ntained. By reducing wheel loading and promoting\neffective cutting, it lowers grinding forces and\nenables the use of very fine superabrasives. It pro-\nvides a method of processing materials that are tra-\nditionally hard to machine and is capable of\nachieving high dimensional accuracy and nano-\nsurface finishes. Along with reducing workpiece\nscratches and subsurface damage, reduced compo-\nnent corrosion and extended fatigue life can be\nachieved [1, 2]. Although ELID has been shown to\nhave many benefits over non-ELID techniques, it has\nfound limited application in actual production\nenvironments. This may be in part due to a reluc-\ntance to adopt the new technology, but also because\nit is often slower and perceived as problematic. An\nincreased processing efficiency can, however, be\nattained through the maintenance of effective cutting\nand the elimination of processing stages, such as the\nneed to perform a polishing operation.\nOver the last 20 years research and development of\nthe technology has resulted in several different\nand distinct methods of using ELID. These are out-\nlined by Rahman et al. [3] and can be characterized\nas follows.\n1.

ELID 3A \u2013 Electrode-less electrolytic dressing\nusing alternating current. Both the wheel and\nworkpiece are oxidized.\nAlthough ultimately lower, grinding forces can\nbecome erratic and unstable when using ELID [4].\nThe problems associated with the ELID 1 technique\nalso apply when evaluating ELID 2 and further com-\nplications arise when using an ELID 3 technique.\nThe vast majority of ELID research is concerned\nwith ELID 1 precision grinding [3, 5\u20137], although the\nELID principle has also been applied in lapping and\nlap-grinding configurations [8, 9]. This paper repre-\nsents a study investigating the use of ELID as a\nmethod of improving ball surface finish driven by a\nrequirement to extend the lifespan of self-aligning\nlined spherical bearings [10].\nThe characteristics of the newly developed ELID\nsuperfinishing process are in many ways fundamen-\ntally different to conventional superfinishing. The\nmain difference is that the use of superabrasives\nprevents the wheel from self-sharpening \u2013 the normal\nmechanism by which dulled conventional abrasives\nare removed and a wheel\u2019s surface is refreshed.\nBecause the wheel\u2019s performance and condition is\ncontinually maintained in-process by the ELID sys-\ntem, metal\u2013resin bonded (MRB) wheels containing\nvery small superabrasives can be used. It is the utili-\nzation of these fine abrasives (30 to 0.12mm) that\nenables surface roughness values below 5nm Ra to be\nconsistently produced on the spherical surface of\ncorrosion-resistant steel balls.\nA number of in-process methods have been\ndeveloped to assess the performance of grinding\nprocesses and aid in the early detection of faults and\npoor grinding conditions. Assessment of grinding\nmechanisms and conditions can be achieved by\nmonitoring acoustic emission [7, 11], eddy current\n[12], grinding forces [4], temperature [13], ELID\npower and control [14], and machine power usage\n[15\u201318]. There are also in-process measurements,\nsuch as wheel wear [19] and machine-vision-based\ntexture analysis methods [20]. However, the fine\nnature of this type of superfinishing, as well as the\nslow removal rates and limited access, preclude\nmany types of monitoring. Both spindle and ELID\npower monitoring were used for this research.\n2 EXPERIMENTAL WORK\nA basic ELID superfinishing system consists of a\nmachine tool, direct current (d.c.) pulse electrical\npower source, electrolyte fluid, and a MRB super-\nfinishing wheel. The conductive wheel is connected\nto the positive terminal of the ELID power supply,\nmaking it the anode. Depending on the type of ELID\nused, either the workpiece fixturing or the workpiece\nitself is connected to the negative terminal and made\nthe cathode.\nThe superfinishing carried out in this research was\na constant-force process involving a spherical area\ncontact between ball and wheel. The wheel spindle\napplied the load via a spring; the load was deter-\nmined by the spring stiffness and compression\nthrough the z-axis linear movement. A 1:50 dilution\nratio of chemical coolant CEM (from Noritake Co.\nLtd) to tap water was used as the superfinishing fluid\nand was applied in a flood application to the ball\u2019s\nspherical surface at the grinding interface. The ball\nmaterial is corrosion-resistant hardened steel,\nAMS5630, used for self-aligning spherical bearings in\naerospace applications (Table 1). Although alter-\nnative wheels were investigated, the results discussed\nin this paper were achieved using MRB cubic boron\nnitride (CBN) superfinishing wheels.\nTo enable ELID superfinishing tests to be con-\nducted, a ball and wheel fixturing system was\ndesigned. This replicated the machine tool\u2019s opera-\ntion used for the standard method of honing and\npolishing in conventional ball production. Although\nby no means a requirement for operation in pro-\nduction the use of a Tetraform-C high-precision\ngrinding machine (Fig. 1) enabled experiments to\nbe conducted with a high degree of accuracy and\nTable 1 Mechanical properties and chemical composition of AMS5630 corrosion-resistant steel\nProperties Value Element Maximum Minimum\nMaterial and treatment AMS5630 (hardened (HT11)) Carbon 1.20 0.95\nUltimate tensile strength 1750 Silicon 1.00 \u2013\nYield strength (MPa) 1280 Manganese 1.00 \u2013\nModulus of elasticity, tension (GPa) 200 Phosphorus 0.040 \u2013\nHardness (Hv) 58\u000162 Sulphur 0.030 \u2013\nDensity (g\/cm3) 7.75 Chromium 18.00 16.00\nCTE, linear 20 \u0002C (mm\/m \u0002C) 10.2 Molybdenum 0.65 0.40\nHeat capacity (J\/g \u0002C) 0.46 Nickel 0.75 \u2013\nMaximum continuous service\ntemperature in air ( \u0002C)\n760 Copper 0.50 \u2013\nProc.

The system developed allowed the investi-\ngation of ELID 1, 2, and 3 configurations.\nElectrical contact of the ball and wheel spindles\nwas made through a brush copper contact running\non the steel fixturing. Both the superfinishing wheel\nand ball were always electrically insulated from the\nrest of the machine. As the spring was compressed\nafter making initial grinding contact, the wheel and\ninner wheel fixturing receded into the outer wheel\nfixturing along a needle roller bearing, lubricated\nwith a silicone-based lubricant. The use of a needle\nroller bearing provided a number of line contacts that\nensured smooth movement while maintaining stiff-\nness in the x and y directions. An expanding collet\nthat located and fixed the ball via its face and bore\nwas designed to work in conjunction with Tetra-\nform\u2019s removable truing spindle.\nThe ELID power values were logged via a connec-\ntion to a computer data acquisition system (labview).\nWheel spindle motor load was also monitored using a\nHall effect sensor. This universal power cell module\nwas able to determine spindle power by performing\nan instantaneous vector multiplication of voltage and\ncurrent.\n2.1 Pre-process conditioning of wheels\nAs new wheels do not come pre-formed, truing, pre-\nprocess dressing, and bedding-in operations are\nrequired in order to form a spherical wheel\u2019s surface\nthat has a suitable geometry and condition. When\nelectrodischarge truing, which was the most effective\nmethod found, a steel ball is connected into the ELID\nelectrical circuit. The touch point position between\nthe positively charged wheel and the negatively\ncharged truing ball is maintained and results in\nextensive sparking and rapid erosion of the wheel.\nNormal spindle speeds can be used; the grinding\nzone should be flooded with coolant and truing\naggressiveness reduced towards the end of the truing\ncycle. Pre-process dressing of the wheel is required to\nremove damage caused as a result of truing, to\nachieve a suitable grinding surface, and to prevent\nmetal-to-metal contact when ELID 3 superfinishing.\nThis research used a gap of 0.2mm and normal\nsuperfinishing speeds were used as slower speeds\noffered no advantage. Only a short initial pre-process\ndress of the wheel should be conducted (\u00032min) as it\nis preferable for the ELID layer to generate under\nnormal superfinishing conditions. Bedding-in the\nwheel with the ELID on further improves ball-to-\nwheel conformity and helps develop the required\nwheel condition at its grinding surface. Initially only a\nminimal load should be applied, gradually increasing\nto the full superfinishing load over approximately\n5min.\n2.2 Details of ELID type used\nWhen using ELID 1, the ball being processed is\ninsulated from the negatively charged ball holding\nfixturing with the dressing taking place in the 0.2mm\ngap between the wheel\u2019s grinding surface and ball\nfixturing (Fig. 2). ELID 2 (interval dressing) can be\nconducted prior to a processing run on a separate\nball adjacent to the one being superfinished. The\nELID 2 dressing operation is typically conducted for a\nshort time period but on a regular basis, i.e. one short\nELID 2 dress of the wheel prior to each ball pro-\ncessed. Exchanging the insulating nylon washer for\none made of steel connects the ball being processed\non to the electrical circuit, thus changing the dressing\nprocess into ELID 3. ELID 3 superfinishing does not\nuse a separate electrode. In-process dressing is\nachieved directly at the grinding interface between\nthe wheel and the ball. It is implemented at full\ncontact during superfinishing. ELID 2 and ELID 3 can\nbe used on all ball sizes, whereas there are some\nrestrictions on the use of ELID 1 due to ball geometric\nconsiderations.\nFig. 1 Precision machine tool at Cranfield (TetraForm C) Fig. 2 ELID 1 arrangement for spherical superfinishing\nProc.

Contact pressures of\n0.5, 1.0, and 1.5MPa (upon the projected area normal\nto the applied load) were achieved when applying the\nforces of 45N, 90N, 135N respectively. For RNB08\nballs, an r\/min measurement of 963 converts to 1m\/s.\nA wheel speed of 5215 r\/min and a load of 67.6N were\nused to maintain consistency for comparisons across\ntests. Owing to the configuration employed, relative\nsuperfinishing spindle speeds vary at differing points.\n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1 Surface finish\nInitial ELID 3 testing provided information on the\ntypical surface finish produced by the various abrasive\nsize MRB\u2013CBN wheels (Fig. 3) and demonstrated that\nthe goal of 10nm Ra was certainly achievable. The #500\nmesh ELID wheel, containing 30mm abrasives, pro-\nduced comparable results to the standard super-\nfinishing processes. Wheels #4000 to #20000 (4 to\n0.8mm) all produced similar values; the best recorded\nbeing 2nm Ra using the #8000 wheel. In this case the\nfinest abrasive wheel did not produce the smoothest\nsurface. The strong dependence on exacting set-up and\nwheel condition was responsible for a greater degree of\nvariation thanwas caused by the comparative closeness\nbetween these abrasive sizes.\nWhen using a #500 wheel in a free-cutting well-\ndressed condition, distinct grinding marks appeared\non the ball\u2019s surface. However, when the wheel\nbecame glazed, as a result of ineffective or insuffi-\ncient dressing, the surface produced was greatly\nimproved and comparable in quality to a standard\nsuperfinished surface. Of particular promise was the\nhigh quality and repeatability of surfaces produced\nwith a #2000 MRB\u2013CBN (8mm) wheel. As the quality\nwas satisfactory and a relatively large abrasive was\nused, a reduction in processing time can be achieved.\nAgain the surface quality of the ball was dependent\non the condition of the wheel. In a free-cutting con-\ndition, very fine grinding marks were just visible to\nthe naked eye and could be seen clearly under a\nmicroscope. Mirror-like surface finishes were\nachieved with the glazed wheel when the grinding\nmechanism moved more towards a fine polishing\/\nburnishing action than effective cutting (Fig. 4).\nCompared to the larger abrasive wheels, the con-\ndition of the #12 000 wheel had less influence on ball\nfinish. The grinding marks produced were very small,\ntherefore uncut carbides become the predominant\nfactor in determining the surface roughness of the\nball. The benefits gained from reducing the very fine\ngrinding marks through glazing were largely elimi-\nnated by the inefficient cutting of the materials car-\nbide phase.\n3.2 ELID 3 performance\nSuperfinishing using ELID 3 was the original pro-\nposed solution to produce sub-10nm Ra balls,\nbecause of the restricted access involved in spherical\nsuperfinishing. ELID 3 processing was conducted on\nballs ranging from 20 to 48mm in diameter. There\nwas no observable difference in the performance of\nthe process when applied to balls of differing size.\nThe distinct power activity associated with ELID 3 is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 5, which shows the ELID power\nvalues recorded when conducting a 3min pre-\nprocess dress of the wheel (period A), directly fol-\nlowed by 10min ELID 3 superfinishing (C and D).\nAfter the initial pre-dressing period, when grinding\ncontact was made (point B) the current rapidly\nincreased, voltage rapidly declined, and electrical\nresistance was greatly reduced. The ELID was \u2018active\u2019\nTable 2 Example of typical \/ standard RNB08 experimental parameters (O\/D signifies outer diameter; I\/D signifies inner\ndiameter)\nCranfield machine tool, ELID power supply Tetraform C, Fuji-Die \u2013 ED\u0001921\nWorkpiece P\/N, material, dimensions RNB08, AMS5630, O\/D 19.836mm, faces 12.67mm\nSuperfinishing wheel type #12000, MRB\u2013CBN\nWheel truing methods EDT\nELID power settings (voltage, current, duty) Low: 60V, 20A, 10%; High: 90V, 40A, 50%,; Max: 90V, 40A, 70%\nELID 2\/pre-process dressing gap 0.2mm\nBall spindle speed (crown) across static wheel 1.0m\/s @ 963 r\/min\nWheel spindle speed (O\/D) across static ball 4.0m\/s @ 5125 r\/min\nCombined speed (wheel I\/D, ball far side) 1.41m\/s @ 5125, 963 r\/min\nCombined speed (wheel O\/D, ball near side) 4.77m\/s @ 5125, 963 r\/min\nRun time 5min\nSpring compression, applied force 2.75mm, 67.6N\nSpherical area in contact, applied pressure 112.62mm2, 0.6MPa\nFluid type, nozzle size, position, fluid flow CEM, 1 \u00b7\u00bc in nozzle, interface centre, \u00030.1 litres\/s\nProc.

During period\nD the ELID system was \u2018inactive\u2019. When this occurred\nthe ELID system had little or no effect on dressing the\nwheel.\nWhen the load has been applied and processing\nstarted, the ELID system should gradually erode the\nwheel\u2019s bond material to reveal fresh abrasives.\nHowever, this only occurs when the ELID system is\nactively working (period C). The ELID power data\nshow that the system does not consistently maintain\nthe wheel\u2019s condition in a stable manner. A break-\ndown of the oxide\/resin insulating layer results in\ndirect metal-to-metal contact between the ball and\nwheel. At this point electrolysis cannot occur and the\nwheel is not being dressed, which restricts its ability\nto recover (period D).\nThe dynamic contact between the anode and\ncathode makes ELID 3 less effective at dressing than\nother types of ELID. The effectiveness of the process\nis also influenced by the fluid\u2019s ability to penetrate\nthe grinding interface. Stopping and performing a\npre-process dress of the wheel, with a separation gap,\nre-forms the insulating layer at the surface of the\nwheel. The breakdown of the wheel\u2019s condition when\nsuperfinishing is a fundamental problem with the\nELID 3 process.\nIn order to evaluate the required processing time,\nthe rate of surface generation when ELID 3 super-\nfinishing with wheels of differing mesh sizes was\ninvestigated. As Fig. 6 shows, the rate of surface finish\nimprovement declined as steady-state levels began to\nbe reached. For the #20 000 wheel, a processing time\nof around 10min was required.\nAnticipating a faster generation rate with the #4000\nwheel, a shorter time interval was used between data\npoints. After 6min the surface finish values were\nsubstantially higher than the 3nm Ra that the wheel\nis capable of producing. Microscope analysis of the\nsurface produced by the #4000 wheel revealed that\nafter 6min it was not fully generated; making the\n#4000 wheel the slowest at forming a surface on this\nFig. 4 Optical microscope images displaying the typical\nquality of a ball\u2019s surface when produced using a\n#2000 MRB\u2013CBN wheel: (a) in a free-cutting condi-\ntion; (b) in a glazed condition\nFig. 3 Surface finish versus abrasive size from initial tests using RNDEB14 balls, ELID 3, and MRB\u2013CBN\nwheels\nProc.

Vastly differing surface quality often exis-\nted over the spherical surface of the ball as it was in\nthe process of being formed by a particular wheel,\nwith additional Ra measurements, taken on a sepa-\nrate day, varying by up to 8nm. This variation in re-\nmeasurement was an effect of the relatively large\ninfluence of the point of measurement when a ball\u2019s\nsurface is part way through being processed. The\nprocessing times were excessively long for all the\nwheels tested.\n3.3 ELID 2 performance\nELID 2 (interval dressing) is performed periodically\nas a separate stage at the start of a superfinishing\ncycle and restores the wheel\u2019s grinding surface to its\noptimum condition. It is essentially the same as the\npre-process dressing operation, but as the required\ndressing time is dependent on the condition of the\nwheel at the start, the dressing times for ELID 2 are\nshorter.\nFig. 5 Distinct regimes of ELID power activity \u2013 pre-dressing followed by ELID 3 superfinishing (ELID\npower supply set to 60V, 20A, 10 per cent \u2013 RNB08 ball, #12 000 MRB\u2013CBN wheel)\nFig. 6 Rate of spherical surface generation (Taylor Hobson talysurf, across batch of RBFB16AB balls)\nProc.

Engineering Manufacture\nElectrolytic in-process dressing superfinishing of spherical bearings 117\n at CRANFIELD UNIV INFO & LIB SVC on May 4, 2011pib.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nFigure 7 shows how ball material removal reduced\nwhen using a #2000 MRB\u2013CBN wheel. As material\nremoval ultimately ceases when using ELID 2 exclu-\nsively, there is a maximum limit on how much\nmaterial a wheel is capable of removing per dressing\ncycle, before the abrasive dulls and the wheel\nbecomes glazed. Additional processing time at this\npoint will not yield any further material removal.\nIt is necessary to remove 1\u20132mm from the ball\u2019s\nouter diameter in order fully to remove honed or\nstandard superfinished surface features. A #2000\nMRB\u2013CBN wheel is able to remove this quantity of\nmaterial before it becomes glazed and further mate-\nrial removal is halted. The material removal per dress\nis insufficient when processing with abrasives smaller\nthan the #2000 wheel. A #12 000 wheel glazes over too\nquickly and would require more than one ELID 2\ndressing cycle to be performed per ball. Surface fin-\nishes generated with wheels larger than the #2000\nmesh do not reach the required level of sub-10nm Ra.\nBall surface finish improves as material removal\nflattens, therefore a balance must be struck between\nprocessing efficiency and ball quality. In this\ninstance, this was achieved by using the #2000 wheel\nuntil material removal had ceased and glazing had\njust begun. When ELID 2 superfinishing using a lar-\nger contact pressure (1.5MPa) than used to produce\nFig. 7, the total amount of ball material removed\nremained relatively unchanged but the timescale was\nreduced by an order of magnitude.\nSpindle power levels provide good information on\nthe condition of the wheel and therefore on the\nrequired ELID 2 cycle times. Figure 8(b) shows the\npower data corresponding to one of the replications\nin Fig. 7. Spindle power usage during superfinishing\nreduces as the wheel becomes glazed. MRB wheels\ncontain a large proportion of copper and as a result\nthey possess a distinct advantage for ELID 2 in that\nthey dress very quickly (Figs 5 and 8(a)).\n3.4 Optimization of combined ELID 2\u00fe 3\nsuperfinishing\nAs outlined previously, the main problem with ELID\n3 superfinishing is the inadequate dressing and\nerratic maintenance of the wheel\u2019s condition. In an\nattempt to overcome these problems, combined\nELID 2 and ELID 3 was used with a #4000 MRB\u2013CBN\nwheel to run a factorial experiment, with factors and\nlevels as shown in Table 3. Prior to beginning each\nELID 3 superfinishing run, a 1min ELID 2 cycle was\nconducted.\nThe results from this experiment were marked as\nmuch by the absence of strong effects and correla-\ntions as by their presence. The influence that spindle\nspeed and applied load had on the various responses\nwas surprisingly small. The inclusion of ELID 2\ndressing had a number of beneficial effects. It\nreturned the wheel to a well-dressed condition, les-\nsening the influence of the previous run, improving\nFig. 7 Deterioration of a #2000 MRB\u2013CBN wheel\u2019s ability\nto removal ball material when ELID 2 superfinishing\n(parameters as in Table 2)\nFig. 8 Corresponding wheel spindle and ELID power\nvalues to material removal data: (a) ELID power\nvalues during ELID 2 dressing cycle; (b) declining\nspindle power after ELID 2 dressing cycle\nProc.

Assessment of the ELID power\nactivity during superfinishing revealed that ELID 3\nwas erratic and largely ineffective at maintaining the\ncondition of the wheel; this was not improved by\nchanging the various factors. The effects recorded\ncan be attributed equally to the degradation of the\nwheel\u2019s condition after ELID 2 dressing and to the\ninfluence of ELID 3 superfinishing.\nThe fact that an ELID 2 cycle was used influenced\nspindle power results considerably and caused the\nsurface finish to be linked to the slope of spindle\npower. There was a steeper slope decline, strongly\nindicating a faster rate of wheel glazing, when high\npressure was used compared to when low pressure\nwas used. Runs conducted when the applied load was\nhigh also recorded statistically higher spindle power;\ntherefore more work has gone into the ball. When\ncomparing levels at the beginning and end of runs,\nthere was a larger relative difference when a high load\nwas used.\nThe use of ELID 2 did improve processing stability;\nit did not aid the assessment of how factors influence\nball material removal. ELID 2 not only increased\nmaterial removal but also masked the effects under\ninvestigation. This, combined with the unpredict-\nability of ELID 3, resulted in no significant effects\nbeing observed for this response.\n3.5 ELID 1 performance\nThe first runs using the ELID 1 system (Fig. 9) slightly\nimproved the ball material removal rate. However,\nstability was not improved, as zero removal was\nrecorded on some runs. In Fig. 10 the ELID 1 material\nremoval rate is compared with those achieved when\nusing the ELID power supply in various different\nways.\nThere are two main elements which combine to\ncause a vast increase in processing efficiency when\nELID 1 superfinishing: these are increased ELID\npower settings, as demonstrated by Fig. 10, and\noptimization of spindle speeds and applied force.\nWhen high ELID power settings (40A, 90V, 50 per\ncent duty) were used in conjunction with ELID 1,\nthere was a significant improvement in the rate of\nball material removal compared to when low power\nsettings (20A, 60 V, 10 per cent duty) were used. The\napplication of these high power values in an ELID 3\nconfiguration did not lead to an increase in proces-\nsing efficiency. ELID 1 has a number of advantages\nover ELID 3; it allows a wider range of wheel metal\nbond types to be used, as well as improving overall\nsimplicity and performance.\nTable 3 Factors under investigation (run details: 1min ELID 2 dressing cycle conducted before the start of each 10min\nELID 3 superfinishing run.

Engineering Manufacture\nElectrolytic in-process dressing superfinishing of spherical bearings 119\n at CRANFIELD UNIV INFO & LIB SVC on May 4, 2011pib.sagepub.comDownloaded from \nThe ELID 1 power results (Fig. 11(b) ) showed that\nvoltage remained stable and high, current remained\nlow, and the wheel was continually maintained close\nto its fully dressed condition. Because there is a\nseparation gap between anode and cathode when an\nELID 1 set-up is employed, there is a large resistance\nin the electrochemical cell. When fresh sites of the\nwheel\u2019s copper bond are uncovered while super-\nfinishing, the electrochemical cell is affected, causing\na decrease in resistance. The process achieves its own\nequilibrium very rapidly, balanced by the electro-\nchemical erosion of the wheel\u2019s bond and the gradual\nmechanical wearing of the wheel.\nWhen the ELID 1 system is on, the substantially\ninflated spindle power usage value (Fig. 11(a) ) shows\nthat the wheel is being continually dressed and\nmaintained in a heightened free-cutting state. The\nspindle power data show how rapidly the spindle\npower level declines when the ELID system is turned\noff. The decline in spindle power corresponds to the\nball material removal levels shown in Fig. 12.\nThe correlation between wheel spindle power data\nand their relationship to wheel condition was used to\nhelp optimize the processing parameters for max-\nimum material removal. The most aggressive pro-\ncessing parameters (maximum possible ELID power\nsetting, high contact pressure 1.5MPa, and fast wheel\nspeed (5.0m\/s) ) produced a spindle power increase\nduring superfinishing that approached 350W\n(Fig. 13). The lower power levels recorded for the\n#500 wheel are representative of how the coarser\nabrasive wheels were less responsive to ELID dres-\nsing than the finer mesh wheels.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nThis research has ultimately provided a process that\ncan repeatedly produce balls with surface finishes of\nbetween 1 and 4nm Ra. Material removal rates have\nbeen increased substantially, resulting in a vastly\nreduced processing time. ELID superfinishing can be\nused after cylindrical grinding as a single finishing\nstage alternative to the conventional honing and\npolishing operations, or after honing as part of a two-\nstage finishing process.\nThe results demonstrated that using ELID provides\ncontrol of wheel wear and condition, and ultimately\nball material removal. However, significant differ-\nences in performance were revealed between the\ntypes tested.\n1. When no ELID is used, material removal rates and\nspindle power levels fall to zero as the wheel\nrapidly becomes glazed and stops cutting effec-\ntively. Processing with MRB\u2013CBN wheels without\nelectrolytic dressing is not sustainable.\n2. ELID 3 (electrode-less) superfinishing does not\nwork effectively, is inefficient and erratic. Stable\nand consistent grinding conditions were not\nFig. 11 Rate of wheel glazing and recovery when ELID 1\nsuperfinishing with a #12 000 MRB\u2013CBN wheel \u2013\ncorresponding to Fig. 12, \u20182nd replication\u2019:\n(a) wheel spindle power data; (b) ELID power data\nFig. 12 Deterioration of a #12 000 MRB\u2013CBN wheel\u2019s\nability to remove ball material when ELID 1 is\nturned off during superfinishing (parameters as in\nTable 2)\nProc.

High-quality surface\nfinishes are possible but processing times are\nexcessively long.\n3. ELID 2 (periodic ELID dressing) was considered\nsuccessful and can be used where an ELID 1\narrangement is not possible. Consistently sub-\n10nm Ra finishes can be achieved with a #2000\nwheel.\n4. ELID 1 proved to be the most effective type of\nELID tested. It allows more aggressive and con-\nsistent dressing, a faster rate of ball material\nremoval, and a substantially reduced processing\ntime. Surface finishes of 2 nm Ra were achieved\nwith a #12 000 wheel, which is an order of mag-\nnitude better than balls currently produced using\nbarrelling or polishing.\nFactors such as ball roundness and surface output\nquality are, for the most part, not a function of the\ntype of ELID used but a reflection on how effectively\nit works. Controlling wheel condition and achieving\nfull and even ball-to-wheel conformity are the two\nmost significant contributory factors to the success of\nELID spherical superfinishing. Insufficient control of\nthese factors results in poor output quality. Mon-\nitoring of wheel spindle and ELID power usage pro-\nvides useful information in assessing the condition of\nthe wheel and identifying potential problems. High\nspindle power correlates with fast material removal\nand is a result of high loads and a free cutting action.\n\u0001 Authors 2011\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the support\nprovided by NMB-Minebea UK Ltd who part funded\nthis research.\nREFERENCES\n1 Pavel, R., Pavel, M., and Marinescu, I.
