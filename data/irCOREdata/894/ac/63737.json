Introduction \nThe emission of pollutant gases (SO2, NOx and NH3) from the United Kingdom, from \nEuropean sources and international shipping leads to deposition of acidifying and eutrophying inputs \nto sensitive ecosystems. Acidification affects soils and freshwater, particularly in upland areas where \nannual precipitation is high (NEGTAP, 2001). The acidification of soils is known to result in the loss \nof sensitive species of vegetation and the leaching of cations from soils (Al and Ca++) which are \ntoxic to fish and other biota at high concentrations. Deposition of both reduced nitrogen (NHx) and \noxidised nitrogen (NOy) results in eutrophication leading to changes in plant species composition \nand water quality in semi-natural habitats. In addition to these effects, the pollutants provide a source \nof secondary particulate matter in the atmosphere, through the formation of ammonium sulphate and \nammonium nitrate aerosols. The long-range transport of particulate matter means that deposition \nexceeding the critical loads for environmental damage may occur, even in regions remote from the \nsources, such as the Scottish Highlands. Aerosols are of additional concern regarding their adverse \nimpacts on human health (COMEAP, 2001). \n  The need to protect sensitive ecosystems from environmental damage has led to the signing \nof international and European agreements on reduction of emissions of pollutant gases. These \ninclude the United Nation Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Gothenburg protocol, under \nthe Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) and the European \nCommunity National Emissions Ceiling Directive (NECD). These agreements lay down targets for \nnation states to achieve reductions of emissions of SO2, NOx and NH3 by the year 2010. Major \nreductions to the emissions of SO2 and NOx from land sources have been achieved in recent decades \nin the UK (Dore et al., 2005) and in Europe, with further reductions forecast over the next 15 years \n(Grice et al., 2005). However the benefit in these emissions reductions is partially offset by the \nincreasing contribution of emissions from international shipping. Estimations of emissions of SO2 \n 2\nand NOx from international shipping suggest annual increases of 2.5% (Endresen et al., 2003) \ncaused by increasing traffic and lack of emissions controls. The sulphur content of diesel oil for road \ntraffic was recently lowered by European Community legislation from 350 ppm to 50 ppm. However \nin European waters, the average sulphur content of marine heavy fuel oil was recently estimated at \n2.7% (27,000 ppm) (EEB, 2004). Recent inventories estimate ship emissions of SO2 to globally \ncontribute between 3.2 Tg [S]\/yr (Endresen et al., 2003) to 4.7 Tg [S]\/yr (Corbett and K\u00f6hler, 2003). \nThese numbers reflect their importance as well as their high uncertainty. Emissions from \ninternational shipping fall outside the area of policy influence of the European Community and the \nUNECE. However the MARPOL convention was put in place by the UN International Maritime \nOrganisation to restrict emissions of SO2 and NOx from international shipping. This included a \nglobal sulphur cap of 4.5% for bunker fuel and a 1.5% limit for the Baltic Sea and North Sea. \nAs well as the introduction of monitoring programmes to measure concentrations of \npollutants in air and in precipitation, numerical models have been developed to calculate acidic \ndeposition. Atmospheric Transport Models (ATMs) simulate the emission of pollutant gases, their \nchemical transformation in the atmosphere as well as the diffusion and advection of pollutants, their \nwashout by precipitation and dry deposition to vegetation. These models include the EMEP Eulerian \nmodel (Tarras\u00f3n et al., 2003) which operates at a 50 km resolution and is used to assess acid and \nnitrogen deposition on a European scale. UK Lagrangian models include FRAME (the Fine \nResolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutants Exchange model; Singles et al., 1998), HARM (the Hull \nAcid Rain Model; Metcalfe et al., 2001) and TRACK (Lee et al., 2000) which operated on 5, 10 and \n10 km grid resolutions, respectively. These models used spatial emissions inventories for SO2, NOX \nand NH3 and were able to calculate deposition of sulphur (SOx), oxidised nitrogen (NOy) and \nreduced nitrogen (NHx). Estimates of the exceedance of critical loads for acid deposition and \nnitrogen deposition can subsequently be derived from the modelled deposition. Studies conducted by \nDerwent et al. (2005) used a global Lagrangian chemical transport model to estimate the \n 3\ncontribution to acid deposition in Europe from international shipping emissions along the Atlantic \ncoast. \nIn this paper we consider the application of FRAME to investigate the distribution of \nnitrogen and sulphur deposition in the United Kingdom using emissions data for the year 2002. The \naccuracy of the model was verified by a detailed comparison with measurements from the UK \nnational monitoring networks for gas and particle concentrations in air and ion concentrations in \nprecipitation. The model was applied to demonstrate the important contribution of shipping \nemissions to sulphur deposition in the United Kingdom. The effect of introduction of a policy to \nreduce emissions of SO2 from international shipping in the North Sea, according to the MARPOL \nconvention, was estimated. \n \n2. Description of the Model \n The Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange model (FRAME) is a \nstatistical Lagrangian trajectory model that can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of sulphur \nand nitrogen deposition to the United Kingdom. The model has been used for government policy \napplications in estimating the influence of abatement of pollutant gases, (such as NH3, NOx and SO2) \non the exceedance of environmental critical loads for acidification and eutrophication (Vieno, 2005).  \nConceptually, FRAME represents a column of air with 33 layers of varying thickness ranging from 1 \nm at the surface and increasing to 100 m thickness at heights above 100 m (Singles et al., 1998). The \nmodel domain has a 5 x 5 km2 horizontal resolution, which includes the United Kingdom and the \nRepublic of Ireland. \nThe output from FRAME-Europe, a similar model with a 150 x 150 km2 grid resolution and \na domain covering Europe, was used to initialise the FRAME model trajectories. FRAME-Europe \nuses 50 x 50 km emissions from the EMEP inventory (http:\/\/webdab.emep.int\/) re-gridded onto the \n150 km grid. The directionally-dependent European scale modelled concentrations for all chemical \n 4\nvariables in a column of air were input to the trajectories at the edge of the FRAME grid. \nTrajectories were advected across the domain, with different starting angles at a 1o resolution, using \ndirectionally dependent wind speed and wind frequency roses generated from a ten year radiosonde \ndata set (Dore et. al, 2006). Gridded emissions of SO2, NOx and NH3 were taken from the national \natmospheric emissions inventory (www.naei.org.uk, Dore et al., 2005). Vertical diffusion is treated \nusing k-theory eddy diffusivity and solved with a Finite Volume Method (Vieno, 2005). For oxidised \nnitrogen, a suite of gas phase reactions is considered and both dry phase and aqueous phase \noxidation of SO2 are represented. Wet deposition is calculated with scavenging coefficients and a \nconstant drizzle approach, using precipitation rates calculated from a climatological map of average \nannual precipitation for the British Isles. An enhanced washout rate is assumed over hill areas due to \nthe scavenging of cloud droplets by the seeder-feeder effect. The washout rate for the orographic \ncomponent of rainfall is assumed to be twice that calculated for the non-orographic component \n(Dore et al., 1992). The model incorporates the directional dependence of orographic rainfall \ndescribed by Fournier et al. (2005).  Dry deposition of SO2, NO2 and NH3 is calculated individually \nfor five different land cover categories (arable, forest, moor-land, grassland and urban) using a \ncanopy resistance model (Singles et al., 1998). Other species are assigned constant values of \ndeposition velocity. \n The FRAME model code is written in High Performance FORTRAN (Fournier et al., 2003) \nand executed in parallel on a Linux Beowulf cluster. The model has been applied to source-receptor \ncalculations where large numbers of simulations are required. One such example is the estimation of \nthe contribution to nitrogen and sulphur deposition from each of the 75 counties of the UK and from \n20 individual major point sources (Oxley et al., 2003). \n \n 5\n3. Maps of deposition of sulphur and nitrogen \n The most significant data generated from FRAME are maps of dry and wet deposition of \nsulphur and nitrogen for the United Kingdom, which are used to calculate the exceedance of critical \nloads for acid deposition and nutrient nitrogen deposition. In previous studies (Fournier et al., 2003, \n2005) FRAME has been developed as a model to estimate national scale ammonia concentrations \nand produce maps of dry and wet deposition of reduced nitrogen. In this study, the model has been \ndeveloped as multi-pollutant tool. Maps of grid-averaged deposition (including all land cover types) \nfor SOx, NOy and NHx for the year 2002 are illustrated in Figures 1(a) to (f). Figure 1(a) illustrates \ndry deposition of SOx, which is principally due to SO2 gas. Deposition is highest in the industrial \nregions of northern England and along the east coast where major power stations are sited. Areas of \nhigh sulphur deposition also occur in the coastal regions of south and south-east England due to \nemissions from international shipping in the English Channel. The wet deposition of SOx (Figure \n1(d)) shows a pattern less correlated to the sources, which is a product both of the local scale \nwashout of the soluble gases SO2 and H2SO4 and of the longer-range transport of secondary sulphate \naerosol. In Figure 1(b), dry deposition of NOy is shown to be closely correlated to the major urban \nareas of Greater London, Birmingham and Manchester and the interconnecting motorways. As the \nprimary pollutants of oxidised nitrogen, NO and NO2 are non-soluble, wet deposition of NOy is \nassociated with long range transport of secondary nitrate aerosol and is highest not in the source \nareas, but in areas of heavy precipitation, particularly the upland areas of Wales and the Pennines in \ncentral northern England (Figure 1(e)). Dry deposition of NHx is illustrated in Figure 1(c). As \nammonia is emitted close to ground level and rapidly deposited to vegetation, the map is closely \ncorrelated to the emissions. Local variability is evident due to the rapidly varying nature of ammonia \nemissions over short distances. However, the source areas are evident, resulting in high deposition in \nwestern England due to cattle farming and areas of high deposition in the pig and poultry farming \nregions of eastern England. Significant non-agricultural emissions of NH3 (Sutton et al., 2000) also \n 6\ncontribute to high deposition of NHx in major urban areas. Wet deposition of NHx (Figure 1(f)) is \nprimarily associated with the long-range transport of ammonium aerosol and is therefore highest in \nhill areas with heavy annual precipitation. \nOther methods for generating maps of sulphur and nitrogen deposition for the United \nKingdom include application of the EMEP European scale Lagrangian model (Tarras\u00f3n et al., 2003) \nand the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition technique (CBED, Smith et al., 2000; Smith and \nFowler, 2001). The latter is a methodology based upon interpolation of wet deposition and gas \nconcentrations measured at sites in the national monitoring networks. CBED dry and wet deposition \nforms the official UK data set for estimation of exceedance of critical loads for acid deposition and \nnitrogen deposition. A detailed inter-comparison between these different methodologies will be \nundertaken in a future study. The CBED and FRAME wet deposition maps generally show similar \nspatial patterns. In both calculations the wet deposition is driven by a measurement based map of \nannual precipitation for the UK and includes parameterisation of the orographic enhancement of wet \ndeposition. According to the seeder-feeder effect (Dore et al., 1992) orographic precipitation \ncontains a contribution from the washout of polluted boundary layer hill cloud which has been found \nby measurements (Beswick et al., 2003) to contain significantly higher concentrations of pollutant \nions than non-orographic rainfall samples. The EMEP data shows a much smaller influence of \norography on wet deposition. In this case, precipitation is generated by a meteorological model and \norographic enhancement of wet deposition is not specifically represented in the model. Despite \nspatial differences, the average deposition of species show good agreement between FRAME and \nEMEP with national deposition budgets agreeing to within 20%.  The average wet deposition with \nCBED is higher than FRAME by 13%, 48% and 27% for SOx, NOy and NHx respectively. A notable \ndifference occurs for the NOy dry deposition budget (46 Gg N year-1 for FRAME and 98 Gg N year-1 \nfor CBED). This may in part be attributed to an underestimate of HNO3 concentrations in FRAME. \n 7\nHowever uncertainty also arises in the CBED calculation due to the small number of 12 sites in the \nnational monitoring network used for mapping nitric acid concentrations. \n \n4. Comparison of model with measurements from national monitoring networks \nAssessment of the accuracy of FRAME in estimating atmospheric concentrations and \ndeposition rates of gaseous and particulate compounds of nitrogen and sulphur can be made by \ncomparison with measurements. For this purpose, data from the twelve sites in the national nitric \nacid monitoring network (using monthly sampling from the CEH DELTA system, DEnuder for \nLong Term Atmospheric sampling: Sutton et al., 2001) of gas phase (HNO3 and SO2) and aerosol \n(SO42-, NO3-) concentrations were applied. Concentrations of NH3 gas and NH4+ aerosol were taken \nfrom the UK national ammonia monitoring network (http:\/\/www.cara.ceh.ac.uk\/nh3network ) \ncomprising over 100 DELTA samplers and passive diffusion samplers. Concentrations of NO2 were \ntaken from the rural monitoring network using diffusion tubes (http:\/\/www.aeat.co.uk\/netcen ). Wet \ndeposition data were obtained from the secondary acid precipitation monitoring network, comprising \nfortnightly collections of precipitation from 38 sites with ion concentrations analysed by ion \nchromatography (NEGTAP, 2001). All monitoring data were averaged over a three-year period \n(2001-2003) to reduce the influence of inter-annual meteorological anomalies. The measurement \ndata were compared with modelled values for the emissions year 2002. The UK national monitoring \nnetworks for air quality and acid deposition are described in Hayman et al. (2004) \nFigures 2(a)-(c) illustrate the correlation with measurements of modelled SO2 gas \nconcentrations, SO42- aerosol concentrations and SO42- wet deposition respectively. An overestimate \nof SO2 concentrations in more polluted areas is evident from Figure 2(a). Vieno (2005) reported a \nsignificant improvement in model correlation with measurements of SO2 concentrations following \nintroduction of a plume rise parameterisation to the model. However the current overestimate in SO2 \nconcentrations may indicate either that SO2 is oxidised too slowly, or mixed to the surface from high \n 8\npoint sources too quickly in the model. For sulphate aerosol (Figure 2(b)), there is a tendency for the \nmodel to underestimate low concentrations and overestimate high concentrations. A satisfactory \ncorrelation for wet deposition of sulphate is apparent (R2=0.80, Figure 2(c)), with a slope of 0.95 and \nlow intercept of 0.09 for the model-measurement linear regression. \nFigures 3(a)\u2013(d) illustrate the correlation of the model with measurements of oxidised \nnitrogen species. A high correlation is evident with measurements of NO2 gas concentrations and \nNO3- aerosol (R2=0.87, 0.92; Figures 3(a) and 3(c), respectively). However, the model \nunderestimates wet deposition of nitrate (Figure 3(d)) which may indicate either that the washout \ncoefficient for nitrate aerosol used in the model is underestimated or that the conversion of NOx gas \nto nitrate aerosol is proceeding too slowly. The data for measurement of HNO3 concentrations show \ngreater deviation from modelled concentrations (Figure 3(b)). Although agreement is seen at \nconcentrations of about 0.5 \u03bcg m-3, the line of best fit suggests an underestimate in concentrations of \nHNO3 by the model at higher concentrations. The two locations where the modelled concentrations \nare much lower than measurements are sites with agricultural activity which suggests uncertainty in \nthe HNO3 interaction with NH3. In FRAME and according to theory, HNO3 concentrations are \nrapidly depleted in the presence of NH3 by the conversion from gas to particulate ammonium nitrate. \nThis process may be subject to significant sub-grid variability due to the highly localised distribution \nof NH3 emissions.  \nFigures 4(a)\u2013(c) illustrate the correlation of the model with measurements of reduced \nnitrogen species. The correlation of modelled concentrations of NH3 with measurements (Figure \n4(a)) shows considerable scatter. The principal reason for this is the highly localised nature of NH3 \nemissions, such that the modelled average concentration from a 5 km model grid cell may differ \nsignificantly from that measured at a specific location within the grid cell (Dragosits et al., 2002). \nThe graph shows evidence that, particularly at low concentrations, the model overestimates NH3 \nsurface concentrations. There is a need for finer scale national modelling of ammonia \n 9\nconcentrations, preferably at a 1 km resolution, in order to perform a more accurate model-\nmeasurement comparison. A better correlation is observed between modelled and measured NH4+ \nconcentrations (Figure 4(b)) and wet deposition (Figure 4(c)). This is due to the more slowly \nchanging pattern in NH4+ aerosol concentrations, which are not expected to vary on a scale smaller \nthan the 5 km model grid resolution. Figure 4(b) shows that the model generally underestimates \nNH4+ aerosol concentrations which may indicate that the rate of production of NH4+ aerosol from \nNH3 gas is underestimated in the model. \nThe results of correlation with measurements are illustrated for all species in Table 1. \nOverall, the correlations give reasonable slopes and high values of the correlation coefficient R2. \nThis suggests that FRAME is able to accurately represent the spatial distribution of atmospheric gas \nand particle concentrations and deposition fluxes over the United Kingdom. The verification of the \nmodel with measurements suggests that it is an appropriate tool to be used for testing the influence \nof policies to abate emissions of SO2, NOx and NH3. \n \n5. Policy Application of FRAME to the role of shipping emissions \n The contribution of international shipping emissions to air pollution has recently received \nmuch attention (Johnson et al., 2000). Whilst land-based emissions in Europe have shown significant \ndownward trends over recent decades, shipping emissions of SO2 are estimated to be increasing at a \nrate of 2.5 % per year. Emissions of SO2 from international shipping in the coastal regions of the \nBritish Isles are illustrated in Figure 5(a), gridded at a 50 km resolution (ENTEC, 2002; data \navailable from: www.emep.int ). The intensity of emissions is highest in the busy shipping lanes of \nthe English Channel and in the vicinity of major ports. The relative contribution of shipping \nemissions to sulphur deposition in the United Kingdom was assessed by conducting two model \nsimulations. The first simulation included all sources (UK national emissions, long range transport \nof pollutants from Europe and shipping emissions). In the second simulation, shipping emissions \n 10\nwere set to zero. The difference in modelled sulphur deposition between the two simulations \nrepresents the contribution from shipping emissions alone (Figure 5(b)). The significant contribution \nto sulphur deposition in the south-east of England and in other coastal regions is apparent. This \nclose-to-source contribution is principally due to the dry deposition of SO2 gas to vegetation. \nHowever, a long range transport component of sulphur deposition due to shipping can also be seen \nin the form of high deposition in the hill regions of Wales and northern England. This occurs due to \nthe oxidation of SO2 to sulphate aerosol, which is removed from the atmosphere principally by \nwashout from precipitation and results in high deposition in the high rainfall upland regions. This \nprocedure was applied for both the year 2002 and for a future scenario for the year 2020 using \nemissions from the UK Air Quality Strategy (Grice et al., 2005). The future scenario included the \nsignificant forecast reductions in land-based emissions relative to 2002 (of 72%, 45% and 10% for \nSO2, NOx and NH3 respectively) as well as the increase in shipping emissions (Table 2). The forecast \nemissions for the year 2020 also include significant reductions beyond the targets set by the NECD \nfor the UK for the year 2010 (of 45%, 23% and 9% for SO2, NOx and NH3 respectively). Total \nemissions for the two years are shown in Table 2. The results of the model simulations, illustrated in \nTable 3, suggest that the relative contribution of shipping emissions to sulphur deposition in the \nUnited Kingdom will increase from 9% to 28% over the period 2002-2020, with similar \ncontributions to both wet and dry deposition. \nThe results obtained with FRAME compare favourably with estimates from the EMEP model \n(Klein et. al, 2005) which suggest that shipping emissions contribute 13 % to sulphur deposition for \nthe year 2002. In the EMEP model, the larger 50 km grid cells result in a greater proportion of the \nUK land surface area being represented by coastal grid cells, where emissions from the sea occur \nsimultaneously with the process of deposition to land surface. As FRAME is a national scale model, \nthe finer 5 km resolution of the grid cells permits a better distinction between land and sea. A global \nthree-dimensional Lagrangian chemistry-transport model (STOCHEM) run at a 5o x 5o resolution \n 11\nwas applied by Derwent et al. (2005) to assess the regional acid deposition along the Atlantic \nseaboard of Europe. Total sulphur deposition was found to exceed 2 kg S ha-1 in the south-west of \nthe UK. The results with FRAME (figure 5(b)) also exhibit significant areas in the south and west of \nthe country with the contribution to total sulphur deposition exceeding 2 kg S ha-1. However, the two \nmodels used very different horizontal grid spacing and a direct comparison between results would \nrequire regridding of FRAME data onto the STOCHMEM grid. \nThe significance of shipping emissions in contributing to sulphur deposition over land lends \nstrong support to the need for international legislation to constrain emissions from shipping, such as \nthe MARPOL convention on MARine POLlution. Recent legislation involves the introduction of a \n1 % sulphur limit on marine fuels used by all sea-going vessels in the North Sea and the English \nChannel from the year 2010, leading to a 33% reduction in emissions of SO2. An additional model \nsimulation was undertaken for the year 2020 with SO2 emissions from shipping reduced in \naccordance with the MARPOL convention. The abatement measure was effective in reducing total \nsulphur deposition to the UK from 86 Mg to 78 Mg and reducing the relative contribution of \nshipping emissions to UK sulphur deposition from 28% to 20%. The changes to exceedance of \ncritical loads for acid deposition to the environment between 2002 and 2020 have been estimated by \nHall et al. (2006) using the FRAME modelled deposition data. As part of the UK Air Quality \nStrategy, a number of additional emissions abatement scenarios were considered individually, \nincluding the implementation of the MARPOL convention for international shipping emissions, \nemissions of NOx from large and small combustion plants and a variety of measures to reduce \nemissions of NOx from road vehicles (Stedman et al., 2006). The percentage area of ecosystems in \nthe UK subject to acid deposition above their critical loads was calculated to decrease from 54.8% to \n39.4% during the period 2002 to 2020. The additional implementation of the MARPOL convention \nwas found to further reduce the area of ecosystems with exceedance of acidity critical loads to \n38.5%, an improvement of similar magnitude to a scenario which combined the introduction of low \n 12\nemission vehicles with reduced emissions of NOx from small combustion plants. However, \nabatement of NOx emissions had the additional benefit of reducing exceedance of critical loads for \neutrophication. These results suggest that targeting shipping emissions may be an effective way of \nprotecting the environment from acid deposition. \nWhilst both SO2 and NOx emissions have shown strong downward trends in emissions in \nrecent decades, reductions in NH3 emissions have been smaller, and driven primarily by the \ninfluence of market forces on national agricultural activities. The growing relative importance of \nreduced nitrogen to total acidic and total nitrogen deposition indicates that future strategies to tackle \nacidification and eutrophication will need to include measures to abate emissions of ammonia.  \n \nConclusion \n The Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange model (FRAME) was applied to \nestimate the deposition of sulphur and oxidised and reduced nitrogen to the United Kingdom using \nemissions data for the year 2002. The model showed satisfactory agreement with measurements of \ngas and aerosol concentrations and wet deposition of nitrogen and sulphur compounds from the \nnational monitoring networks. The results suggest that the model is an appropriate tool for testing the \neffects of policies to abate emissions of SO2, NOx and NH3.  \nThe growing importance of SO2 emissions from international shipping contrasts with the \nstrong downward trend in land based SO2 emissions. In the absence of emissions controls, \ninternational shipping is set to become a major source of sulphur deposition, particularly in south \nEngland. The model simulations for a recent emissions year and for a future scenario, assuming a \n2.5% increase in emissions from international shipping per year, suggest that the contribution of \nshipping emissions to total sulphur deposition in the United Kingdom will increase from 9% to 28% \nbetween 2002 and 2020. The modelled relative contribution of shipping emissions to total sulphur \ndeposition in the UK for 2002 was also in broad agreement to calculations made with the European \n 13\nscale EMEP model (13%). The model reproduced the maximum deposition of sulphur from shipping \nemissions of up to 2 kg S Ha-1 in southern and western England estimated with the STOCHEM \nglobal scale model. \nThe influence of enforcing the MARPOL convention to restrict the sulphur content of bunker \nfuel used by international shipping in the North Sea from 1.5% to 1% was tested with the model. \nThis was found to result in a 6% reduction in total sulphur deposition to the United Kingdom for the \nyear 2020 and a reduction in the percentage of land with exceedance of critical loads for acid \ndeposition from 39.4% to 38.5%. This improvement to acid deposition was of similar magnitude to \nresults obtained with other abatement strategies targeted at emissions of NOx from vehicles and \ncombustion plants, suggesting that controlling emissions from international shipping may be an \nefficient way to reduce the influence of acid deposition.  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThis work was supported by the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \nunder contract number EPG 1\/3\/302 and by the Natural Environment Research Council  \n 14\n References \nBeswick, K.M., T.W.
