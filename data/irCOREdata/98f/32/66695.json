The discussion started \nhen both Spiegel and Stern magazines published extensive interviews with Fischer \nd stories about his involvement with the radical left-wing political scene in \nankfurt am Main during the early 1970s. Stern magazine headlined the Fischer \nterview \u201cYes, I was a militant\u201d (4 January 2001) while Der Spiegel entitled its own \nad-story \u201cJoschka\u2019s wild year\u201d (8 January 2001). Both publications made ample use \n allegedly newly discovered photographs showing a motorcycle-helmet-wearing \ner beating a policeman during the \u201cKettenhof riots\u201d against housing speculators \nFrankfurt\u2019s Westend in April 1973.1  \ne immediate cause for the German media\u2019s in\ntrial of Hans-Joachim Klein, one of his ac\ns involvement in the December 1975 attack on the Vienna OPEC headquarters. \naving turned his back on terrorism as early as 1976, Klein had lived inconspicuously \n France under a false identity to be arrested only in 1998. In October 1999, almost a \narter-century after the OPEC raid, he was put on trial and eventually given the \nnt sentence of nine years in prison for his part in the kidnapping and the murder \nthe three people who had died during the attack.  \nn 16 January 2001 Fischer appeared as a character witness for Klein in the trial. \nhile he was unable to shed any further light on Klein\u2019s part\nid, as he had lost sight of him significantly earlier than that, \nscription of the political sub-culture of Frankfurt and the role he had played in it. \ne eloquently described how, by illegally occupying large unused flats in Frankfurt\u2019s \nestend and living collectively, the young members of the local unorganized Left \ntempted to create a counter-milieu to the prevailing bourgeois consensus in the city. \nis-)Quoting one of Adorno\u2019s aphorisms, Fischer pointed out that rather than \n                                              \nhile the identification of Fischer on the images of photographer Lutz Kleinhans was new, the \ntures themselves had been published as early as 1973 in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \nhough not owning the copyright, Bettina R\u00f6hl, Ulrike Meinhof\u2019s daughter, had sold them for an \n figure to the press and posted them on her website (www.bettinaroehl.de), until a court-\n1 W\npic\nAlt\nundisclosed\ninjunction forced her to withdraw them from public view. \n  \n \nwait\nfri\nfa\nse\nun\nsa\n\u201ca\nIn erged. \nTh\nof th\nto\nth\nco\nstr\nW\nbe ng the foreign \nse\n\u201cF\nsignificant part \nsta\nse\nM\nco\nun\n19\nex\nest\n   \n3 \ning for the revolution to occur at some distant point in the future, he and his \nends wanted \u201cto lead the right life in the wrong society (das richtige Leben im \nlschen f\u00fchren)\u201d. As far as his own use of violent direct action against the forces of \ncurity during evictions and demonstrations was concerned, Fischer was largely \napologetic. He argued that on those rare occasions he acted in self-defence. At the \nme time, he pointed out that he never condoned the gratuitous violence that the \nrmed struggle\u201d against the political system as a whole involved.2 \n the newspaper debate surrounding Fischer\u2019s court appearance two camps em\ne minority position, whose representatives not surprisingly also included members \ne CDU\/CSU opposition in the Bundestag, argued that although he had apologized \n the policeman, he had not distanced himself sufficiently from his past militancy and \nus was unfit to serve in government. The majority however claimed that Fischer\u2019s \nnversion from street-fighting man to vice-chancellor gave evidence for the unifying \nength and integrationist force of the (West) German state. \nhile the discussion was of little consequence and ended as quickly as it began, \nhind it lurk larger issues. The urgency with which questions concerni\ncretary\u2019s \u2013 by no means secret \u2013 past were asked points to something else. The \nischer debate\u201d betrays a fundamental insecurity about how the metamorphosis of a \nof a political generation from militancy to acceptance of the political \ntus quo came about. The discussion about the foreign secretary\u2019s militant youth, a \nemingly never-ending flow of terrorist memoirs, as well as international \u201cPrada \neinhof chic\u201d, that is, a superficial fascination with 1970s left-wing militancy in \nntemporary pop culture and fashion,3 are symptomatic of a lack of knowledge and \nderstanding about the significance of \u201c1968\u201d and the \u201cred decade\u201d (from 1967 to \n77) in relation to recent German history. Marathon runner Fischer might have \nplained his transformation from young militant to member of the political \nablishment in his fittingly entitled autobiography My Long Run to Myself.4 \n                                              \nosef Hrycyk, Im Wortlaut: Joschka Fischer im Opec-Proze\u00df \nw.spiegel.de\/politik\/deutschland\/0,1518,117823,00.html (15.1.2002), pp. 4 and 12-14.  \np.

As a \nsult West Germany in many respects became indeed a more liberal and modern \nciety. Yet the same governments stifled the reform spirit with the anti-liberal \nf their \u201cpolicy of inner security\u201d (Politik der inneren Sicherheit). Secondly, \ne paradox that the liberalisation and modernisation of the Federal Republic \npposedly owed much to the input of Fischer\u2019s generation, the \u201c1968ers\u201d, whose \ntlook was anti-liberal, anti-parliamentary and anti-western and \u2013 quite importantly \nwhose relationship to the use of violence against the state and the forces of order, as \nscher\u2019s example demonstrates, was ambivalent at best.  \nhile this article will not be able to completely resolve these contradictions, it \ntempts to both shed further light on them and provide insights on h\n60s and 1970s might be explained from a perspective that interprets them as \nmptoms of a conflict between political generations. The discussion of generation \nnflict will be interwoven with a counter-narrative of intergenerational \nderstanding, which proves rather untypical of these conflict-ridden years. The \nstory of the personal relationship between Gaby Tiedemann and Heinrich Albertz. \nll demonstrate that if a politician was willing to assume the role of a surrogate \nther and, in so doing, relinquish his responsibilities towards the political system to \ne benefit of what Max Weber called \u201cabsolute ethics\u201d (Gesinnungsethik), was there \n alternative to the escalation of violence, which was characteristic for the stand-off \nbetween West Germany\u2019s militant left-wing youth and the \u00e9lites of its state and \nso\n   \nciety.  \n                                              \np.

After her release Tiedemann and four other freed militants, \nerena Becker, Rolf Hei\u00dfler, Rolf Pohle and Ingrid Siepmann, met with Heinrich \nlbertz, formerly the SPD mayor of Berlin and now the protestant pastor of one of the \nty\u2019s parishes, on a runway of Frankfurt airport. The Lorenz kidnappers had \npressed their demands in a letter to the West German press agency (Deutsche \nesseagentur, dpa) that was to be published in the major newspapers. Most \nportantly, they wanted six of their jailed \u201ccomrades\u201d to be released from various \nisons in West Germany and West Berlin. These included the then left-wing lawyer \norst Mahler, who was serving a fourteen-year sentence in Berlin-Tegel for formation \n a terrorist organisation, attempted murder and his part in the liberation of Andreas \nader in May 1970. Mahler however quickly declined to be released.6 The \nmaining five had to be flown to an Arab country of their choice and receive a \nm of DM 20,000 each.

In a poll on West Berlin \nection weekend by the Allensbach Institut, 56 percent of those asked were in favour \n a deal with the kidnappers, 36 percent against.8 In what became the first successful \nduction of a public figure in West Germany and remained the only incident in \nhich the West German state allowed itself to be blackmailed by the militant Left, \nter Lorenz, shaken but unharmed, was released soon after.  \nat Heinrich Albertz should accompany the freed terrorists was fraught \nlitical symbolism. Albertz was mayor of West Berlin on the day in 1967 that gave \nVEMENT 2ND OF JUNE its name. On the evening of 2 June 1967, Benno \nhnesorg, a twenty-six-year-old university student, was shot dead by a West Berlin \nlice officer during a de onstration against the Shah of Persia\u2019s visit to Germany. \nperienced and perceived by Ohnesorg\u2019s age cohort as a particularly powerful \nlitical event, his death was crucial for the formation of the \u201cgeneration of 1968\u201d as \npolitical generation\u201d. Furthermore, this first of three \u201ccritical events\u201d for the \n968ers\u201d over the following year also marked the beginning of the end of the non-\nolent phase in the confrontation between the New Left protest movements and the \ngoverning Grand Coalition between the SPD and CDU\/CSU.9 That was \narily because the police behaviour raised the question whether the use of counter-\nolence was legitimate. Most of the protesters saw the exaggerated security measures \nring the Shah\u2019s visit as proof for their suspicion that behind the democratic fa\u00e7ade \n the Federal Republic a proto-fascist state not unlike Persia itself was lurking. \ne second critical event came ten months later, again in Berlin. On 11 April 1968 \ndi Dutschke, leading theoretician of the Socialist German Student League \nozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund, SDS) and figurehead of the anti-\nthoritarian student movement, was shot on the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm and seriously \nred by a neo-Nazi youth.

In \nearly summer of that year, the Bundestag was in the process of passing the \nEm\nth\nin\nth\nsp\nan\n   \n7 \nan alone, the protest movement laid the main responsibility for it at the \ns of the conservative newspaper tycoon Axel Springer. For them Bild, the \npulist flagship of Springer\u2019s press empire, which had portrayed Dutschke as \u201cthe \ncarnation of disorderliness and revolutionary evil\u201d, had inspired Josef Bachmann, a \nifter and petty criminal, in his attempt on Dutschke\u2019s life.10 Although Dutschke \nrvived on the occasion, in 1979 he died prematurely at age thirty-nine from the \nng-term effects of the injuries inflicted upon him. \nver the following Easter days of 1968, demonstrations and b\ninting houses and distribution centres all over West Germany mobilized more than \n,000 protesters as well as 21,000 policemen. In what over five days and nights \ncame the worst episodes of civil unrest in West Germany since the early 1930s, \nore than 1,000 protesters were arrested, 400 people were injured, quite a few of \nem seriously.11 In Munich there were two deaths during the Easter riots. During the \nght 11 to 12 April an Associated Press photographer and a student at the city\u2019s \nchnical University lost their lives following injuries sustained during \nmonstrations. \ne third critical event, which, however, already heralded the end of the protest \novements, occurred\nergency Laws. These were a series of constitutional amendments intended to grant \ne government sufficient executive powers in cases of national emergencies, \ncluding severe internal unrest.12 As this legislation was reminiscent of Article 48 of \ne Weimar constitution, it met with opposition from much of the left of the political \nectrum, including the left wing of the SPD, the metal and chemical workers unions, \nd, last but not least, the student movement, which switched its attention from the \n                                              \nRob Burns\/Wilfried van der Will, Protest and Democracy in West Germany.

Thus it became clear that the transition from protest \n complete overthrow of the political order proved to be far beyond the capacity of \ne protest movements.  \nis insight then marked the beginning of the \u201clong march through the institutions\u201d, a \nuch slower and more laborio\nth APO and SDS dissolved in 1969-70, the idealistic impetus of their members was \n no means spent by then.

While anti-colonialist theoreticians like \ne Guevara, Frantz Fanon and Carlos Marighella legitimized the use of counter-\nolence against the state, they also provided an ideological basis for a new \numanistic ethos\u201d which \u2013 for Elias, \u201cone of the most moving experiences of [these] \nes\u201d \u2013 allowed these young Germans to identify themselves with \u201cthe struggle \nainst injustice, oppression, exploitation of people throughout the world\u201d.32  \nat Elias took a generation perspective in his analysis of the events of the German \ntumn is not surprising. Firstly, his essay is the logical extension of his posthumous \nst book, The Germans, in which he applied his socio-genetic and psycho-genetic \n of the civilising process to the development of national identity in nineteenth \nd twentieth-century Germany. Secondly, in focusing on power struggles between \nlitical generations, Elias followed in the footsteps of Karl Mannheim whose \nsistant he had been before being deprived of an academic career in Germany in \n33. In the 1920s, Mannheim himself had developed the first elaborate historical \neory of generations, when, since the turn of the twentieth century, organized youth \nerged as an important factor in German politics and society.33 Last but not least, \nerman history offers itself quite naturally to interpretations of this sort, since, as \nk Roseman put it, there is a \u201cstriking persistence of youthful rebellion in \nrmany\u201d. The most obvious rationale for the frequent outbreak of open stilities \ntween political generations of Germans from the young writers of the Sturm und \nrang of the 1780s to the terrorists of the 1970s is that \u201cfew other nations have \nperienced such a succession of dramatic breaks in their historical narrative\u201d.34 \nese ruptures in turn guaranteed a high degree of social mobility between \nnerations.  \n \n32 Ibid. p. 417. \n33 Cp.

The importance of \neneration\u201d as an analytical category has been widely recognized by historical \nholarship on \u201c1968\u201d both as an international and a German phenomenon. Eric \nobsbawm, for example, stresses the generational aspect of the youth revolt and \nedits it with achieving a \u201ccultural revolution\u201d, which necessarily followed from the \ncial revolution, which the \u201cgolden age\u201d of economic development had brought \nout.35 Along similar lines, Geoff Eley recently claimed that the rebelliousness of \ndical youth in Germany and elsewhere \u201chad antipatriarchal qualities \u2013 against the \n of fathers in families but also against long-established political authority, \nbodied in the governing gerontocracy\u201d.36 And, while also emphasising \ntergenerational conflict, Heinz Bude has focused on six German life histories in \norder to elucidate the different ways in which those born between 1938 and 1948 in \ntri\n19\nU\nW  recent surveys of the history of the Federal Republic by German \nhi \u201c1968\u201d is \u201cparticularly prone to being overloaded with \nmeaning, if not myth-making\u201d.38 Most authors follow the verdicts of J\u00fcrgen \nH\nde\nim\nfo\n   \ned to extricate themselves from what they saw as the conservative restoration of the \n50s.37  \nnanswered questions \nhen reading\nstorians, one recognizes that \nabermas and Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker, both of whom assigned the breakthrough of a \nmocratic society and the liberalisation of West Germany\u2019s political culture to the \npact of the youth revolt.39 Manfred G\u00f6rtemaker, for example, speaks of a \u201cre-\nundation\u201d (Umgr\u00fcndung) of the republic as a result of \u201c1968\u201d, while for Heinrich \n                                              \nEric Hobsbawm, Age of Extremes.

While the Social-Liberal coalition in Bonn \nially wanted to avoid further confrontation and reintegrate the \u201c1968ers\u201d by, for \nstance, granting a comprehensive amnesty for violations of the demonstration laws \n 1970, the SPD in particular was concerned about how its own youth wing, the \noung Socialists (Jungsozialisten, Jusos), attempted to re-ideologize the party in their \nn version of the long march through the institutions.46 At the same time, the \nU\/CSU opposition, which for much of that decade could delay legislation in the \nderal Council, was keen on discrediting Ostpolitik, d\u00e9tente and reconciliation with \nstern Europe, by claiming that the government was \u201csoft on communism abroad and \nremists\u2019 at home\u201d.47 The SPD in government felt certainly vulnerable on this \nt, since despite the party\u2019s firm integration into the social and political system of \ne Federal Republic after Godesberg, it had only in 1969 become the largest party in \ne Bundestag and still felt the need to prove its reliability. Add to this the Munich \nlympics massacre in 1972, for which the authorities had been completely \nprepared, the murder of a federal judge by the RAF in 1974 and the successful \nrenz kidnapping \u2013 to name just the most prominent incidents of terrorism during \n                                              \nerhard Braunthal, Political Loyalty and Public Service in West Germany: The 1972 Decree against \ndicals and its Consequences (Amherst, Mass.: The University of Massachusetts Press, 1990), p. 166. \n43 G\nRa\n44 A.

As Markovits and Gorski put it: \u201cAbove all, the \nte\u2019s measures seemed inappropriate, due to the fact that any kind of left-wing \ntremism, let alone of the terrorist sort, enjoyed absolutely no support among the \npulation as a whole.\u201d48 \nhy however \u2013 to continue with\nd secretly murdered the Stammheim inmates of the RAF in their cells? That \nspicion was first voiced when Ulrike Meinhof, arrested with the other leaders of the \nF as early as June 1972, could not bear life in prison any longer and hanged herself \n May 1976. The discovery of the dead bodies of Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-\nrl Raspe in their cells a year-and-a-half later on 18 October 1977 seemed to \nnfirm it.

Of course, on the surface this was the \nsult of an accelerating spiral of tit for tat, violence and counter-violence. However, \n a deeper level, the answer for this question has indeed to be sought in the clash \ntween different political generations and in their respective attitudes towards the \nazi past. Both the West German electorate and the \u00e9lites of the state, which felt it \ncessary to resort to exaggerated repressive measures in order to protect the \nnstitution, and those who wanted to bring down liberal democracy were encased in \ne experience of the Third Reich. For both sides it was a historical memory, which \nheir political actions in the present.

Like Hans-Joachim Klein in 1999, she was \ncused of having participated in the 1975 raid on the OPEC headquarter in Vienna. \nuring the attack, in which eleven oil ministers of OPEC states were held hostage for \nenty hours before being eventually flown to Algeria with the kidnappers, two of the \nsualties, an Austrian police officer and an Iraqi bodyguard, were supposedly shot \necution-style by the only female member of the group, known only by her cover \nme \u201cNada\u201d. In the aftermath it was widely assumed that Nada was Gaby \nedemann.57 As opposed to Klein, who, injured by a stray-bullet during the attack, \nd to be treated in a Viennese hospital and could be positively identified, \nedemann\u2019s identity could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt even at the time, \ncause the Austrian authorities had bungled their investigation.58 Fourteen years later \nit was even less possible to prove her involvement and that was her salvation.
