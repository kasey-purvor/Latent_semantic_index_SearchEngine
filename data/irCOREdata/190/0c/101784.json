The SGT \nhas several advantages compared with a standard FET. \nThese include a much lower saturation voltage, higher \noutput impedance and in the case of amorphous silicon, \na much better stabiliiy. \n1. Introduction \nThin film field effect transistors are the basic \nbuilding blocks for circuits on glass and plastic \nsubstrates. They are used extensively in display \naddressing circuitry and pixel circuits as well as in \nimaging arrays for optical and x-ray detectors. The most \ncommonly used semiconductor is hydrogenated \namorphous silicon but polysilicon is becoming \nimportant, as are various semiconducting organic \npolymers [I]. All the transistors made to date use the \nfield-effect concept in which a voltage applied to the gate \nmodulates the conductance of a channel region [ 2 ] .  Here \nwe are concerned with a source-gated transistor (SGT) in \nwhich the current is controlled by a source banier the \nheight of which can be modulated by a gate located \nopposite to the banier [3]. \nThe source-gated transistor has been shown to \nhave important advantages compared to the standard \nE T .  In particular it can have a very much smaller \nsaturation voltage and therefore it  can be operated with a \nsmaller drain voltage and with lower power dissipation. \nIn this paper, particular attention is paid to the \nSGT in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) with a \nsource harrier formed using a metal-semiconductor \nSchottky barrier. This transistor is relatively easy to \nmake using ion implantation technique to control the \nsource harrier height and provide passivation and field \nrelief [4]. \n2. Source-Gated Transistor Concept \nA general form of SGT is shown in Fig.1. This is \na symmetric structure with an ohmic drain contact on \neither side of a source barrier. The gate lies opposite the \nsource so that it can modulate the whole of the source \nbarrier when a voltage is applied. The current flows over \nthe source barrier to the semiconductor-insulator \ninterface and then laterally to an ohmic drain region. The \ndrain current saturates with drain bias when the \nsemiconductor under the source is depleted by the \nreverse-biased source barrier. It has been shown that the \nsaturation voltage can be as much as ten times lower than \nin an E T  [4]. This structure is suited to high mobility \nsemiconductors such as polysilicon since the extrinsic \ndrain resistance between the source and the drain contact \nwill be low. In this case the off-state depends on the \nheight of the source hamer and its dependence on drain \nvoltage whilst the on-state is determined by the effect of \nthe gate voltage on the effective barrier height. \nSource barrier \n(A) \nN' \nSemiconductor \nInsulator \nGate \nGlass \nSource barrier \nDrain  PA^ Drain n \n-Semiconductor \nInsulator \nGate \nGlass \nFig.1. (a) Shows general form of SGT where the gate lies \nopposite the source barrier and the drain contacts are \nohmic; (h) SGT with extended gate in order to minimize \nthe extrinsic drain resistance. \nFor low mobility semiconductors the extrinsic \ndrain resistance is prohibitive without using conductivity \nmodulation at the semiconductor-insulator interface as in \nan FET. The structure (Fig.Ib) has more parasitic \ncapacitance but low drain resistance. Effectively we now \nhave an SGT in series with an FET of length d. The off- \nstate is now determined by the threshold characteristics \nof the FET whilst the on-state is determined by the \ncharacteristics of the SGT.

The SGT in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon \nSource-gated transistors have been made in \nhydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) using ion \nimplantation technique to control the effective barrier \nheight of a chromium Schottky source barrier and to \nprovide compensation and passivation at the edge of the \nsource contact [4][5]. Since the a-Si:H bas a very low \nmobility, a structure with a modulated extrinsic drain \nconductivity similar to that schematically shown in \nFig.lh was used. The SGT was made using 300nm SiN \nand l0Gnm of a-Si:H both deposited on glar;s using \nPECVD.

Transistor characteristics of an SGT. The width of \nthe source was 600um. \nThe SGT transistor characteristics (Fig.2) have \nexcellent characteristics with sharp saturation at voltages \n(VSAT) very much smaller than found in a conventional \nFET. At Vc=10V for example VsAT is 4 . 5  volts. For an \nFET this corresponds with =7V (Vo-VT). The SGT can \ntherefore be operated in saturation at much lower drain \nvoltages and with smaller power dissipation. Since the \ncharacteristics are controlled by the effect of the gate on \nthe source barrier we expect the characteristics to be \nindependent of the separation between the source and \ndrain contacts d Fig.1. This is indeed the case as shown \nin Fig.3 where the saturated drain current at VG=5, 10, 15 \nand 20V is plotted against the length d. The drain current \nin an SGT, therefore, scales only with source width w \nwhilst for an FET it scales as w\/L where L is the channel \nlength. The linear relationship between saturation current \nand source width w is shown in Fig.4 for four different \ngate voltages. \nThe physical processes that determine the output \nimpedance of an SGT are very different 6om those in an \nFET. In the SGT the impedance is controlled by field \npenetration from the drain towards the source bamer \nwhen a drain voltage is applied. In the FET there is an \neffective shortening of the channel with drain voltage, \nwhich increases the conductivity of the channel. In the \nSGT, however, the source is screened by the close \nproximity of the gate, which should lead to high output \nimpedance. Fig. 5 shows the characteristics of an SGT \nand an FET in which d=1;2microns. The same \nsemiconductor and insulator deposition was used in both \ncases. It is evident from Fig.5 that the output impedance \nof the SGT is higher the FET which suggests that the \nSGT should be able preserve its characteristics with \nsmaller dimensions. \nV,=l5V \nV,=lOV 1v,=5v C t 2 2x1o-'O 0 1x10.'0 \ne o  \n2 Source-Drain separation d [urn] \n.- \nL \n1 2  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1  3 I \nFig.3.

Plot of the saturation current as a function of \nsource width w. \nThe stability of an a-Si:H SGT is also much \nimproved compared to an FET. The instability in a-Si:H \nis related to the position of the electron quasi-Fermi level \nin the device during operation and its deviation from the \nequilibrium level. Changes in the quasi-Fermi level lead \nto defect generation and trapping and the threshold \nvoltage changes. In general the greater the electron \nconcentration the higher the generation rate. Therefore in \nthe accumulated channel of an FET large numbers of \ndefects are formed while in the depleted source region of \nan SGT the defect generation rate is small [6]. A \ncomparison between an E T  and SGT both stressed in \nthe same way and made using the same semiconductor \nand insulator layers is shown in Fig.6. The FET shows a \nlarge threshold shift due to defect generation as expected. \nThe SGT has some threshold shift when the current is \ndetermined by the parasitic E T ,  however in the on-state, \nwhen the current is controlled by the source barrier the \ndevice is much more stable than the FET. \nI26 \nAuthorized licensed use limited to: University of Surrey.

Extension to Defective Semiconductors \nIn principle the SGT does not require doped layers \nand is relatively easy to make using thin film technology. \nThe SGT is therefore compatible with technologically \ndifficult materials such as plastic and organic polymers. \nAll that is required is a method of obtaining a potential \nbarrier. A further consideration is the benefit of being \nable to pin the quasi-Fermi level, because trapping and \ndefect generation can be very pronounced in these highly \ndisordered materials leading to instability and hysteresis. \n5. Conclusions \nIt has been shown that the source-gated transistor, \na new transistor for thin film electronics, has a number of \nimportant advantages over the FET. The SGT is \nrelatively easy to make using thin film technology and \nlends itself to technologically difficult semiconductors \nwhere doping and stability are an issue. \n6.
