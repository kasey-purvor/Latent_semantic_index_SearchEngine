Since the 1990s, the ward \nmentor has emerged as the key to student nurses\u2019 learning in the UK.  \nMethods: a literature study of new leadership roles and their influence on student nurse \nlearning (restricted to the UK) which includes an analysis of ten qualitative interviews \nwith stakeholders in higher education in the UK undertaken as part of the literature \nstudy. \nResults: Learning in clinical placements is led by practice teaching roles such as \nmentors, clinical practice facilitators and practice educators rather than new leadership \nroles. However, workforce changes in clinical placements has restricted the \nopportunities for trained nurses to role model caring activities for student nurses and \nuniversity based lecturers are increasingly distant from clinical practice.  \nConclusions and implications for practice: leadership for learning in clinical practice \nposes three unresolved questions for nurse managers, practitioners and educators - what \nis nursing, what should student nurses learn and from whom? \nImplications for Nursing Management: leadership for student nurse learning has \npassed to new learning and teaching roles with Trusts and away from nursing managers. \nThis has implications for workforce planning and role modeling within the profession. \n 2\nKey words: \nHigher education  \nLearning in practice \nNursing leadership  \nProfessional learning \nIntroduction \nThis paper reports a literature study which critically evaluated the literature in the area \nof leadership for learning in clinical practice in the British setting only (Barrientos 1998). \nA literature study is wider than a literature review and allowed us to critically analyse \nand evaluate the literature and other sources of information on a topic, including \nstakeholder interviews as in this case, as well as formulate an argument and present the \nresulting analysis in relation to new aspects of inquiry.  \nWe argue that the structures of ward management have radically altered since the \nNational Health Service (NHS) Plan (DH 2000) and that these structural changes, which \nhave shaped both nurse education and nursing practice, have influenced the nature of \nleadership for learning in the UK; pivotal to these structural changes have been the \nchanges to the role of the ward sister and the introduction of new nursing leadership \nroles.  \nWe have therefore structured this paper in two main parts: the first discusses the \nliterature concerning the structural and policy changes which have affected the nature of \nleadership for learning and the second discusses the literature on learning in \nprofessional, nursing practice. We intersperse each of these discussions with extracts \nfrom stakeholder interviews undertaken as part of the literature study to illustrate the \n 3\nmeaning these policies have for individuals at the centre of policy change in nurse \neducation. \nHistorically student nurses were the primary care givers as well as learners in wards. \nMoores & Moult (1979) estimated 75% of direct care used to be given by students in the \n1970s and trained nurses taught and students learned while they worked (Fretwell 1982); \nat least until the curriculum reforms of the 1980s and the introduction of supernumerary \npractice for students with the Project 2000 curriculum (Wilson-Barnett et al 1995; NMC \n2004). The introduction of subsequent curricula (UKCC 1999; NMC 2004) led to \ndebates about fitness for practice and competency among student nurses and trained \nstaff as well as continuing differences in opinion about the place of nursing in higher \neducation institutions (HEIs) (Altschul 1992; Draper 1996). Lahiff (1998) notes that \nthere was always a resistance to intellectualism which led to a paralysing ambivalence in \nnursing vis a vis education; its location in higher education and its consequent \nrelationship with the NHS continue to raise questions for the national stakeholders we \ninterviewed. \nRepeated research during the 1980s (Fretwell 1982; Lewin & Leach 1982; Ogier 1982) \nshowed that positive working relationships between permanent staff and students led to \na good learning environment. In addition, these researchers also found that the ward \nsister had a key role in determining the ward learning environment. Smith (1992) found \nthat, in addition, a good learning environment for student nurses led to good patient \ncare. However, following this period of relative stability, Wiseman (2002), collecting \ndata in the mid 1990s, found that the ward learning environment was fragile and \nadversely affected by changes in the ward sister role.  \nThe study design \n 4\nThe literature study formed stage one of a two year project funded by the General \nNursing Council Trust for England and Wales; stage two included empirical data \ncollection in four sites in England (to be reported in a separate paper). University ethical \napproval was obtained for the literature study which involved a review of published \npolicy and literature to investigate national changes and policies related to the clinical \nlearning environment for student nurses as well as consultation with ten key national \nstakeholders in face-to-face interviews. The following terms, learning in practice; \nnursing leadership; professional learning and higher education, were searched in the \nfollowing electronic databases: BNI; CINAHL; Medline(Ovid) & Medline Pubmed; \nPsyInfo; IBSS; British Education Index. The inclusion criteria were as follows: English \nlanguage, peer reviewed, national and international journal papers from 1990 until 2006. \nThe focus of the literature and policy was the UK. Reports from national professional \nbodies and policy documents from the Department of Health were also included. These \npolicy documents generally formed the background to the literature study rather than \nthe focus of the papers included in the review. The collected literature was then read by \none researcher (HA) and further papers were retrieved which did not include the search \nterms as themes developed in our analysis of the literature. A thematic analysis was then \nmade of the literature (Barrientos 1998) using the following questions:  \n1. What is the main focus of the paper? \n2. What are the main findings?  \n3. What implications are there in this paper for leadership for learning? \nFour key themes emerged from answering these questions following careful reading of \neach paper and these are presented in this paper: \n1. Changes in clinical leadership \n 5\n2. Evaluation of the move to higher education in the 1990s \n3. The nature of professional learning in nursing \n4. Student nurses\u2019 learning experiences \nAn interview schedule was developed following the initial reading and thematic analysis \nof the collected papers. The interviews were undertaken with four heads of nursing \nschools, one deputy director of nursing education, two nurse education managers, a \nparticipant of a national leadership programme, one professor of nurse education and one \nprofessor of nursing research. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed \nthematically within the research team. The stakeholder interview data are useful as a \nmeans to contextualising the reality of policy changes for those driving and indeed \nimplementing the policy agenda; their views provide an interesting counterpoint to the \nresearch data which is fairly limited. \n Changes in clinical leadership  \nThere were 12 papers which discussed changes in nursing leadership and their impact on \nlearning which were a mixture of original research (7) and commentary2 (5). \nLeadership for learning is at the forefront of the new NHS because changing workforce \ninitiatives introduced by Government since 1997 demand new ways of working and \nlearning (Melia 2006). However, in terms of leadership for student nurse learning and \ndrawing on empirical work, Melia argues that new nursing roles are \u201cshaped by changes \nin the medical workforce and particularly by the desire for a consultant led service\u201d \n(2006:1) and that delivering the new NHS reforms is driven by a workforce agenda rather \nthan an educational one.  The challenge remains for, \u201cpractice disciplines need to map \n                                                 \n2 However while acknowledging that in a literature study the type of paper needs to be acknowledged, i.e.: \nresearch as opposed to commentary or policy; nevertheless the commentary pieces are frequently written \nby researchers in the field and can therefore be seen as evidence based. \n 6\nuniversity qualifications onto skills\u201d (2006:22); and this challenge affects fitness for \npractice at the point of registration. For example, in a commentary paper reflecting on \nthe changes in the role of the ward sister during the 1990s, Mann (1998) describes her \nexperience of being a ward sister and now a specialist nurse; she observes that the former \nhad a strong emphasis on student nurse learning while the latter has little.  \nLorentzon\u2019s review of modern matrons (unpublished) suggests that the changes to the \nward sister\u2019s role in the 1990s led to a gap in nursing management filled by the modern \nmatron. She argues that the re-introduction of matrons \u201creflected a political awareness of \npublic nostalgia, if not for Hattie Jaques character, for the person who was perceived to \nhold it all together\u201d (unpublished:3). Lorentzon points out that there are few references \nto learners in the literature on modern matrons (including policy documents). Of the \nresearch papers which do explicitly refer to leadership roles and student nurses, \nHutchings et al (2005) cites mentors and matrons as key stakeholders in regard to \ndetermining the number of learners who can be accommodated in particular clinical \nareas. And Scott & Savage (2005), in their national evaluation of the modern matron role, \nlist nursing education as a core function of modern matrons but provide no further \ndiscussion on this topic. Rather vague references are made to student nurse learning in \ntwo commentary papers; Carlowe (2002) reports one matron seeing her role as including \nsupervision of students and Mercer (2002) stresses the need for modern matrons to have \nan appreciation of the value of learning. \nWhile there are few references to student nurse learning in the leadership, research \nliterature, learning organisations and cultures (MacCormack & Slater 2006) are seen as \na way of promoting leaders for learning and therefore improvement in the delivery of \nservices (Kerfoot 2003).  \n 7\nThe notion of role modelling is seen as a traditional expectation of less experienced \nnurses learning from more experienced nurses and role modelling is thought to allow \nstudents to work alongside practitioners in busy wards (Murray & Main 2005). Davies \n(1993) argued that clinical role modelling could integrate the art and science of nursing. \nStudents in her study were able to articulate their values to \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 care through \nexposure to clinical practitioners. The role of the teacher was to facilitate expression of \nvalues to facilitate their development as trained nurses. However, changes to skill mix on \nwards (Langridge & Hauck 1998) and the lack of constructive feedback from role models \nwhich allow students to convert observed behaviours into their own behaviour \n(Donaldson & Carter 2005) are noted in both these studies to adversely affect the \npotential of role modelling for learning. \nEvaluation of the move to higher education in the 1990s \nIn the context of nursing leadership for learning, the relationship between education and \npractice has had a pivotal role in shaping the occupational culture and politics of nursing \n(Rafferty 1992; Birchenall 2003; Kirby 2003; Lorentzon 2003); indicated perhaps by the \nnumber of papers (34) reviewed in this theme. In all 14 commentary papers, three \npolicies and 17 research papers were reviewed in this theme. \nOverall, the move to higher education has been difficult for nursing education (Burke \n2005; Thompson & Watson 2006; Betts 2006) for many of the reasons described by \nLahiff in her analysis of the earlier introduction of experimental degrees in nursing. For \nexample, the Times Higher Education (2005) cited the HEPI Report which found that \nnurse training is embedded in higher education without the profile of typical higher \neducation subject. Nursing admits students with sub-degree qualifications for entry and \nresearch is marginal; per capita spending on nursing is less than medicine and dentistry. \n 8\nLorentzon (2003) comments that this lack of integration into higher education as a \nresult of the socialisation practices of 19th & 20th century student nurses into nursing \nwhich continue to be problematic today. These practices meant that a split developed \nbetween clinical practice and theory in curricula and the move into older polytechnics \nmeant developing research has been difficult and nursing departments less well \nintegrated as research disciplines in higher education sector. She locates the move \nhistorically as a professional agenda of nurse tutors which was unsupported by \npractitioners. \nWhile knowledge may have been seen as possible within the university, Horrocks (2005) \ncomments that nursing\u2019s move to higher education coincided with the introduction of \ncorporatism into universities and nursing became caught in the drive for outcomes and \nless rather than more scholarly activity. It has also coincided with widening access \nacross the higher education sector generally as Magnusson et al (2006) found in their \nempirical study of clinical placements. \nImportantly in relation to clinical learning, Stew (1996) argues from empirical data that \nthe move into higher education led to an increased theory practice gap in the way nurse \nteachers were viewed by practitioners as well as their perceived credibility and the effect \nof these on student learning and clinical skills. The role of the clinical teacher and the \nnurse tutor\/lecturer are relatively well researched in the literature and obviously remain \na source of anxiety among the nurse teaching profession (Millar 1993; Davies et al 1996; \nCarlisle et al 1996; Kirk et al 1996; Kirk et al 1997; Camiah 1998; Glen & Clark 1999; \nIoannides 1999; Humphreys et al 2000; Murphy 2000; Fairbrother & Mathers 2004; \nGillespie & McFetridge 2006). The role of the university based nurse lecturer and nurse \ntutor is seen to be to support the mentors, to remain actively engaged with evidence \n 9\nbased practice if no longer clinically delivering hands-on care and to support a learning \nenvironment and practice development. For example, in one of these research paper, \nHumphreys et al (2000:311) argue that a realignment of the role of the lecturer is overdue \ngiven the \u201cshift in responsibility for clinical learning\u201d; namely from the tutor to the \nmentor. \nAshworth & Morrison (1989) suggest that the move to higher education would lead to \nstronger links between academia and practice but addressed the difficulties they saw for \nstudent nurses in negotiating the ambiguities the new role offered them as \nundergraduate students. Drawing on empirical data, they argue that these ambiguities \narose firstly from the theory practice gap and the learning opportunities it presented in \nterms of which role the student undertook either as the learner or the producer of work; \nsecondly from the placement experience and the short term nature of their membership \nin clinical teams.  \nAlong with these concerns with the role of the link lecturer, the ambiguities of nursing \nstudent identity as learners in both the university and the NHS (Burkitt et al 2000) and \nthe supervision of learning in practice have been well researched. There has also been \nconcern with fitness for practice expressed in commentaries in the literature (Bradshaw \n1997; 1998; 2000; Chambers 2007). However, in a comprehensive policy review \ncommissioned by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) (Moore 2005) into \nAssuring Fitness for Practice, Moore concludes that the concerns expressed in the literature \nare exactly that, concerns rather than substantiated evaluations or research studies; \n\u201cthere is no robust evidence to indicate systematic failure to prepare nurse who are fit for \npractice at the point of registration\u201d (2005:76). Indeed, in comparison with international \nregulatory bodies, the UK system of regulation and accreditation is well regulated, well-\n 10\nstructured and rigorously delivered. He does report evidence of weakness in assessment \nof and a lack of standardisation of clinical competence, pressures on clinical placements \ndue to the increase in student numbers and inadequate preparation and shortages of \nmentors. Chambers (2007) usefully points out in an editorial that a basic discrepancy \nbetween views held by nursing management and education around what constitutes \nfitness for practice. He argues that education educates students to be fit for the future \nand nursing managers wants newly qualified nurses who are fit for purpose; these two \nviews have always held sway within nursing but recent Government reforms are \nbringing them into conflict more openly. \nIn two public statements, the Council of Deans & Heads of UK University Faculties for \nNursing and Health Professions has made clear its concerns with the problems raised by \nMoore (2005). In their draft response to the NMC consultation on current standards on \nmentoring (2005), they argued that there are limitations on learning in the current \npractice environment i.e. a higher turnover and dependency of patients in clinical areas. \nThe Council urged the NMC to move away from its emphasis of hours completed in \nclinical practice irrespective of the quality of those hours; instead they argued that to \ndeliver competent nurses on qualifying, more use could be made of practice gained in \nsimulated environments. Likewise it disagreed with the NMC\u2019s suggestion of an \nadvanced level of mentoring while continuing to emphasise the importance of mentoring \nand suggesting replacing the hours in practice and therefore the stress on mentors with \nincreased hours of simulated learning and assessing practice with OSCEs. They \nemphasised support and development of all mentors rather than creation of a new role of \n\u201cexperienced\u201d mentor suggested by NMC. \n 11\nIn a press statement from the Council on local funding, commissioning and contracting \nissues in England, the Council argue that the current cuts in places for nursing, \nmidwifery and allied health professions students are short sighted and take no account \nof workforce needs in the future (2006). In particular, they draw attention to the \nproblems created by commissioning and contracting between the NHS and higher \neducation institutions which are destabilising the education and training infrastructure\u201d \nand \u201ctotally undermining the partnerships between universities and the NHS\u201d (2006:1). \nIn a Hansard Report of a debate on the impact on higher education of NHS \ncommissioning 20th February 2007, these points are again raised.  \nThe stakeholder interviews  \nThe stakeholders\u2019 main reactions to questions around leadership for learning and the \nmove into higher education focused on the difficulties of establishing relationships \nbetween higher education and practice and the effects of those relationships on student \nlearning. For example, when asked about the nature of commissioning in higher \neducation, one interviewee said learning in clinical placements was \u201cWorsened by a lack of \ncommunication between HEIs [higher education omstotutions]and practice and lack of IT skills in \nclinical staff and lack of \u201crefined\u201d processes in clinical areas which conflict with expectations [in HE]that \nstudents will develop different set of skills e.g.: analytic and critical skills\u201d (STGNC402\/06). \nOne interviewee commented on the physical spaces students negotiated between \neducation and practice saying, \u201crole modelling is more difficult with students being located in HE\u201d \n(STGNC203\/06). And another said, there is  \n\u201cConfusion among students whether nursing education is campus or practice based learning. Role models \nare needed for students to identify what nursing contribution nursing makes to multi disciplinary team \u2013 \n 12\nspecialist nurses have deskilled general nurses and students need exposure to all nursing leadership roles. \nSpecialist nurses don\u2019t see pre-reg as part of their remit \u2013 prefer to work and teach registered nurses \nwithin the speciality\u201d (STGNC503\/06).  \nThis interviewee explained that while nursing leadership roles had developed,  \n \u201cWard managers were seduced into managerialism at the same time as the resurgence of clinical roles \nwhich don\u2019t seem clear as to their focus on student nurses\u2019 learning \u2013 it appears to be left up to the \nindividual practitioner\u201d (STGNC503\/06). \nIn the absence of leadership from senior nurses in practice and a physical space between \npractice and education, leadership for learning has become relocated, \u201cAcademics can\u2019t \nsupport effectively in practice \u2013 pressure is on mentors and lack of academic clinical career \u2013 the model \nwe\u2019ve got in nurse education is historical\u2026 if you were picked out for being bright and teaching was your \nthing, then you were sort of lost to the profession. We can\u2019t sustain that in the future\u2019 (STGNC402\/06). \n\u201cModern matrons are not really fitting with student learning; more interested in making wards run \nproperly. I think the qualified accountable nurse as mentor is much more important than the Ward Sister \nin showing that learning is done.  They are responsible for their students\u2019 learning.\u201d (STGNC706\/06) \nAnd the consequences of leadership of learning being situated with mentors was \nsuggested to have implications for the future structure of education of student nurses at \nDiploma level,  \n\u201cUndergraduates have role models in HE but do Diploma students? Schools of nursing are being \nrecreated in \u2018parent trusts\u2019 and student nurses have an identity with practice not HE\u201d (STGNC303\/06). \n In summarizing the move to higher education, one interviewee said, \n 13\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost our way in having any genuine oversight of [our] students\u2019 learning on the ward\u201d \n(STGNC503\/06). \nThe nature of professional learning in nursing \nThe search was narrowed in this theme to focus on 24 research papers which dealt \nexplicitly with professional learning in nursing due to the large number of papers \navailable on professional learning more generally (Evans et al 2005).  \nStickley & Freshwater (2002) explored in a qualitative study the question, Why do \npeople enter nursing? They argued that healthcare delivery systems drain the capacity to \ncare which prompts students to enter nursing; this draining of the capacity to care has a \nbearing on learning and the development of the individual student\u2019s nursing or \nprofessional identity. In a later paper, Freshwater & Stickley (2004) suggest that \nemotional intelligence and the capacity to care influences nursing behaviours and the \ndelivery of care. Emotional intelligence is, they suggest, also linked to what students \nunderstand nursing to be and what do student nurses learn to do as nurses. The notion \nof vocation or the attraction to caring work and its role in learning is commented on by \nothers (Hugman 1991; Rozier et al 1992; Danka 1993; Barnitt 1998). In relation to learning \nand socialisation in nursing education and drawing on empirical data, Akerjordet & \nSeverisson (2004) argue that developing moral character in relation to clinical practice is \nimportant on fostering the mental health nurse\u2019s identity. Supervised learning in clinical \npractice fosters emotional intelligence, responsibility, motivation and the deeper \nunderstanding of patient relationships  and the mental nurse\u2019s identity and role. \nIn several research papers, the importance of how students learn in the clinical setting \ngiven that learning is culturally situated and individually constructed by a variety of \ndifferent sources is emphasised (Jarvis 2005; Swanick 2005). For example, Lave & \n 14\nWenger (1991) discuss the role of the sociocultural acquisition of knowledge and the role \nof everyday cognition in a variety of social contexts. In the nursing context, Spouse \n(2001) argues that sociocultural learning with supervision to foster professional and \neducation development is effective in developing competency in nursing students. She \nalso emphasised the mentor\u2019s role in making craft knowledge explicit and facilitating \nunderstanding through repeated exposure to experience.  \nInherent to professional learning goal is the question of professional identity. For \nexample, Hohn, Lanz & Severisson (1998) found that nursing students\u2019 experiences of \nprocess-oriented group supervision fostered nursing students\u2019 professional identity and \ntheir preparedness to act and reflect; they also found that professional identity includes \nincreased understanding and ability to sense patients\u2019 needs, as well as increased self-\nconfidence and responsibility towards patients.  \nIn a literature review of learning in clinical practice, Field (2004) argues that the most \nrecent curriculum in England acknowledged the importance of competent nursing \npractice and shared responsibility for achieving this by making NHS employees jointly \nresponsible for this with teachers based in higher education. She argued that the \ndrawback of adopting Benner\u2019s learning framework in pre-registration education (as in \nthe Project 2000 curriculum) meant that there was little emphasis on psychomotor skills \nand how the student acquired the expertise to deal with risk and decision making; for \nBenner & Wrubel (1989) learning is practical knowing without understanding through \nexperience. Field argues students need to access hidden means of professional learning \nand suggests that situated cognition describes methods of practical learning used in \nprofessional education. Benner\u2019s approach relies on a good learning environment and \nstimulating dialogue between a good mentor with good knowledge who in turn requires \n 15\nsenior support; as Finnerty & Pope (2005:315) found in their study, the transfer of craft \nknowledge in professional practice \u201coccurs through a range of subtle, often hidden, \nmethods\u201d. \nA number of research papers dealt with emotions and learning. For example, John (2000) \nargues that professional learning is charged with emotion but emotional learning has \nbeen a neglected aspect of socialisation; in fact, emotions are helpful in decision-making \nin situations of indeterminacy. For Clouder (2005), learning occurs where knowledge \nencountered is \u201ctroublesome\u201d and the student has to integrate new knowledge with \nexisting thoughts and knowledge. Learning in this way has been defined as threshold or \ntransformative in nature and as such \u201climinal\u201d. She suggests some concepts are \nparticularly troublesome such as caring where the messiness of practice conflicts with \nthe ideals students hold of caring; students would like learning to care to be trouble free! \nBut it exactly this messiness where learning occurs and where emotions are fruitful and \ncreative part of learning \u2013 the emotions in practice give rise to indeterminacy in decision-\nmaking and then learning takes place. Of particular interest is the notion that emotions \ndo not interfere with rational choice or decision making but enhance decision making in \nsituations of indeterminacy which a lot of nursing is. Cousin (2003 cited by Clouder \n2005) refers to this aspect of learning in indeterminate situations as drawing on \nemotional capital.  \nHow students learn effectively remains a focus of the research literature. For example, in \na study funded by the English National Board, Burkitt et al (2000) investigated the \ncognitive and affective processes used by students to learn. As important as cognitive \nprocesses were, they describe how students learn to be nurses in communities of practice \nwhich act to integrate students because they help students and staff identify with \u201ctheir\u201d \n 16\ncommunity of practice and develop an identity as a nurse. Olsson & Gullberg (1991) also \nargue that nursing curricula in Sweden have failed to recognise the professional status \npart of learning through role modelling; they argue that the professional role is \ntransmitted through tacit knowledge and registered nurses consolidate their role in their \nfirst year through work experience and role modelling. \nTwo recent studies show how important role modelling and socialisation processes are \nin student learning. Ousey (2006) investigated how students learned nursing and \nshowed how students described becoming a real nurse through learning fundamental \nskills from observing and working with health care assistants (HCAs) in practice. For \nthe observing students, trained nurses were assessors, planners and evaluators and \nmanagers of care. Students could not identify who they should learn from and what they \nshould learn; this led to theory\/practice gap and an idealisation of theory by students. \nTrained nurses acknowledged the theory practice gap and said they did not practice as \nthe students were taught in college. As Bradshaw has argued, nursing has developed a \nculture where nursing is seen as managing care and not delivering basic care (Bradshaw \n2000). Ousey\u2019s work also raises another issue: what do student nurses see as nursing \nwork and does it include delivering as well as managing care?  \nAnother more recent study by Mackintosh (2006) investigated the impact of \nsocialisation on students nurse\u2019s ability to care. She observes that during their training, \nto fit in with the system, students become desensitised and lose the capacity to care and \nthe value of care which is what attracted them to the profession in the first place; she \ndescribes this as caring less, coping more. Student nurses developed hardiness to protect \nthemselves and cope; they gritted their teeth and switched off. \nStakeholder interviews 2 \n 17\nWhile the nature of learning was discussed in the stakeholder interviews, what is \nstriking about these data is the strength of feeling about what students should be learning \nin terms of essential skills and who they should be learning from. For example, \n\u201cPreparation in curriculum should be as close as possible to what they\u2019re actually going to do \u2013 but they \naren\u2019t doing that [basic care] but we never did [as staff nurses]. This is really where the problem lies \u2013 \nwhat should we be teaching student nurses? \u201c (STGNC303\/06). \n\u201cLeaders of nursing should supervise care and you need to give care to know how to supervise it\u2019 \n(STGNC503\/06).  \n\u201cDilemma in that \u2018students are no longer the workforce providing basic care; HCAs are doing this and \nstudents no longer seek to do basic care; they seek to instruct others to do it rather than have a lifetime of \ndoing it. The role of staff nurse is the management of care, administration, organisation and \ncommunication outside the ward\u201d (STGNC303\/06).  \nIn this last extract, a nurse lecturer reflects that nurse education\u2019s concern with learning \nhas deflected our attention away from the purpose of nurse education for nursing, \n\u201cthe other thing about nurse education is we get bored and we invent things all the time\u2026in nurse teaching, \nI get very excited by it, it\u2019s great but actually what we\u2019re required to do is quite simple\u201d (LL3GNC104\/06) \nLearning experiences in practice \nIn 18 research papers reviewed in this theme, it appears that student experiences are \naffected by placement capacity, audit and the management of learning in the new NHS as \nwell, perhaps most importantly of all, their relationship with their mentor. Hutchings et \nal (2005) explored stakeholders\u2019 views of how decisions are made on how learners can be \nsupported in practice. They found that these decisions are shaped by conflict between \nthe expanding numbers of student nurses and the practice\u2019s capacity to support learners. \n 18\nThey argue for a need to develop necessary roles and strategies to enhance support for \nlearning in practice and the structured management of placement experience. New roles \nhave been introduced to improve links between HEIs and placements (Burns & \nPatterson 2005; MacCormack & Slater 2006); these include practice based educators \n(Allen 2003); practice development facilitators (Clarke et al 2003); placement co-\nordinators (Smith et al 2003) and clinical education facilitators (Wilkins 2004). \nMentors remain the key leaders for learning in current nursing curricula (Andrews & \nChilton 2000; Pearcey & Elliott 2004; Pellatt 2006). For example, Lloyd-Jones et al \n(2001) emphasise the importance of regular mentor-student contact to avoid hanging \naround; they found that a mentor\u2019s absence can mean students working with untrained \nstaff (HCAs) doing HCA work. Effective sponsorship by the mentor allows access to \ncultural knowledge and practices of clinical team. The type of mentoring a student \nreceives as well as the quantity is important; in exploring students\u2019 perceptions of \nmentor\u2019s role, Chow & Suen (2001)  and Orland &-Barak & Wilhelm (2005) found that \ninstrumental learning and mentoring is more important for students than adopting an \nadvisory or counselling role. Andrews & Roberts (2003) argue that what constitutes \nappropriate support for learning remains unclear and there is little agreement as to \nwhich methods promote deep learning in practice. They argue that current systems of \nmentoring do not promote deep learning and offer the clinical guide as a role which can \npromote such learning. It appears from this literature that the role of mentor requires \nfurther exploration and evaluation (Andrews & Wallis 1999; Watson N A 1999). \nFor mentors, causes of stress in clinical learning environment were the nature and \nquality of support they received from HEIs in practice environment (Watson S 2000) \nand assessment (Neary 2000). As discussed above, Moore (2005) argues that systems of \n 19\nassessment of clinical competence are variable. This may be influenced by mentors \nundertaking mentor preparation courses not because they choose to become a mentor \nbut to enhance job prospects (Watson S 2003). Watson concludes that the mentor role \nshould not be a requirement for promotion in clinical nursing. \nConclusions \nFrom this literature study we conclude that learning in clinical practice is shaped by \nseveral factors. Firstly, the nature of nursing work \u2013 \u201cwhat is nursing\u201d - is a question that \nhas bedevilled nursing as an occupation since its inception (e.g. Nightingale & Bedford-\nFenwick). Goddard (1953) argued that nursing could be defined as technical, affective \nand basic work. Fretwell (1982), Melia (1982) and Alexander (1983) all found that nurses \nand student nurses valued these components of nursing work differently; each was \nassigned low or high status. Smith (1988:3) argues that there are differences between a \n\u201cprofessional rhetoric of caring and nurses\u2019 own work priorities\u201d. This is borne out by \nmore recent work done by Smith et al (2006) into the delivery of caring work by \noverseas-trained nurses (Allan in press).   \nSecondly, what should student nurses learn and from whom? Both the literature \nreviewed and the stakeholder interviews suggest that the nature of nursing and \ntherefore, how what nurses should do inform the curriculum, continues to be an issue \nwhich needs addressing in nursing education. The stakeholders felt that student nurses \nshould learn basic and affective as well as technical care in order to supervise it as \ntrained nurses. They thought that trained nurses should also continue to practice these \nskills in their careers.  \nBreaking down boundaries between health professions is currently encouraged in health \npolicy (Rushmer 2005; Nancarrow & Borthwick 2005) at the same time as role modeling \n 20\nand socialisation within professions is thought to foster professional identity formation. \nGiven that traditionally health professions have not learned interprofessionally, blurred \nboundaries in practice have implications for shared learning and different socialisation \nprocesses. In addition, while the papers reviewed emphasise the importance of role \nmodels for learning, they also suggest that existing interpretations of these new nursing \nroles do not place student nurse learning at the heart of their leadership function and \nthat student nurses may be learning essential care from health care assistants and not \nnurses.  \nReferences \nAlexander, M.F.  1983.
