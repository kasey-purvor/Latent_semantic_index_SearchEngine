To \nrealise an all inclusive concurrent engineering process, tools for the upstream \ndesign activities are needed.  In practice, it is often difficult for the companies \nto have a shared understanding of what needs to be developed and so \nspecifications contain ambiguities in describing the product requirements.  This \npaper clarifies the problem domain in the context of a complex product, \ndesigned and manufactured in a pan national Extended Enterprise and serving a \nhighly competitive market.  The authors show how the challenge can be \naddressed through the application of ontology.  A model of a requirements \nmanagement tool is proposed that will allow the various systems and \nassociated levels of a product to be described and then shared through the \nsupply chain.  A prototype system is presented and illustrated through a case \nstudy from the automotive industry. \n \n  2\n1. Introduction \nOne avenue for realising high quality products, at a competitive cost and at the \nappropriate time for the market, adopted by several industries especially the automotive \nsector, is the close and early involvement with the supplier base for product \ndevelopment.  Concurrent engineering principles facilitate the design and \nmanufacturing functions of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and associated \nsuppliers to conduct varying degrees of their activities in parallel.  At the fundamental \nlevel it is the product requirements that enable this product development functionality \nbetween geographically and culturally distinct organisations.  Different organisations \noperating in a common supply chain, working concurrently during product development \nmust have a shared understanding of the requirements; this is difficult to achieve in \npractice.  Omissions, ambiguities and incorrect assumptions often have to be resolved \nresulting in increased work effort and cost.  This paper will make the case, using the \nautomotive industry as a pertinent example, that a requirements management \nphilosophy is the most fundamental and yet prime factor for enabling concurrent \nproduct development between an OEM and their suppliers.  Additionally, the paper will \npresent the position that engineering organisations can have a shared understanding of \nthe product requirements through the application of ontology.  A case study illustrates \nthe creation and use of ontology and a prototype software tool that harnesses the power \nof ontology to realise concurrent product development will be presented. \n \n  3\n2. The impetus for concurrent engineering in the automotive industry \nMany industries are making the move to global sourcing (Esterman and Ishii 2001).  \nSuch a tendency is prevalent in the automotive industry.  For example Ford, General \nMotors and DaimlerChrysler are all engaged in this activity \u2013 primarily for achieving \nlow prices (Nellore et al. 2001).  Global sourcing has resulted in a trend of modular \nsupply by the 1st Tier.  Although, this trend was initially justified on the basis of cost \nreduction, Collins et al. (1997) report that \u2018the need for increased speed to market and \nfor new business development\u2019 are the driving force.  From an OEM standpoint, it is \nboth costly and risky to attempt to provide the level of innovation required by market \nforces through only internal resources (Hamel et al. 1989, Kogut and Zander 1992, \nBucklin and Sengupa 1993); suppliers of major modules are playing a greater role \nduring product development (Esterman and Ishii 2001).  This is readily apparent in the \nfact that OEMs are allowing their 1st Tier suppliers greater design responsibilities and \ninvolving them at an earlier stage, i.e. during the product definition stage (Chung and \nKim 2003).  According to Liker et al. (1996), this provides the OEM \u2018access to a wealth \nof in-depth technical knowledge and innovative capacity\u2019.  Just as importantly it also \nenables the personnel in both organisations to have direct and extensive communication \nduring product development (Clark 1989, Dyer and Ouchi 1993, Liker et al. 1996).  \nThese trends in the automotive industry provide great impetus for realising an all \ninclusive concurrent engineering environment.  Renault for example are realising the \nbenefits for concurrent engineering, Jordan (2003), with respect to: \n\u2022 Cutting time and development costs \n\u2022 Improving design quality \n\u2022 Mastering the increasing complexity of products \n  4\nTo establish concurrent engineering practices the automotive industry has pioneered \nimplementing digital product development across the supply chain.  There has been \nprogress in the harmonisation of CAD systems, the utilisation of simulation tools and \nthe realisation of the digital mock-up for a complete vehicle.  PSA Peugeot-Citroen, for \nexample, use their \u2018Co-Conception\u2019 application for digital modelling with their \nsuppliers (Arozamena 2003).  However, to have an all inclusive concurrent engineering \nenvironment, tools are needed for application in the conceptual product stages and the \narea of Requirements Management has been overlooked relative to the advances made \nin digital product development for downstream activities. \n \n3. The importance of product requirements to concurrent engineering \nEl Wakil (1998) states that there are four pillars upon which the methodology of \nconcurrent engineering rests, namely: \n\u2022 Organisation \n\u2022 Communication infrastructure \n\u2022 Requirements \n\u2022 Product development \nProduct design is driven by the product requirements.  The needs the product must meet \nto be a success are the prime factor for initiating the concurrency of work between an \nOEM and supplier.  According to Holmes (1994) \u2018the essence of concurrent engineering \nis that all the necessary design inputs are introduced as early as possible, so that the \ndesign evolves from a correct basis and separate activities can be carried out in \nparallel\u2019.  Hooks and Farry (2001) state that \u2018if you have poor requirements, you will \nend up being either over budget, behind schedule, with an unsatisfactory product, or all \n  5\nthree\u2019.  The critical input is a clear understanding of the product requirements.  If you \ndo not understand what the customer needs then securing a sale and ensuring a profit is \nlikely to be difficult.  Specifying and then properly communicating the correct \nrequirements is more crucial when the product development is undertaken by another \nparty, such as the case of a 1st Tier supplier.  The OEM is relying on the supplier to not \nonly satisfy them but more importantly their customers \u2013 the end users.  It is of course \nthe aim of the product development process to fulfil all of the product requirements and \nto release the product for manufacturing (Naumann et al. 2002).  In addition to \nunderstanding and being clear about the product requirements, they must be \ncommunicated to all the parties responsible for development (Svensson and Malmqvist \n2001).  To enable concurrent engineering there must be greater emphasis on the concept \nthat Sunnersjo et al. (2003) refer to as \u2018requirement-driven\u2019.  They state that the product \nrequirements represent the \u2018voice of the customer\u2019 and provide the objectives and \nconstraints for all the phases of the product development process. \n \n4. Problems when working with requirements in practice \nThe early development phases of many products, including automotive products, are \nfraught with uncertainty.  On OEM-supplier collaboration, Fagerstrom and Johannesson \n(2001) report that \u2018many delays in product development projects\u2019 are related to \ninadequate requirements.  The production of a set of requirements requires the \nintegration of information from various sources, both internal and external, and in many \nformats.  Individual requirements are added, refined or removed by negotiations, \ndiscussions and clarifications.  The requirements are traditionally represented within \ntext documents (Svensson and Malmqvist 2001).  Effendi et al. (2002) recognise that \n  6\nthe principal means of communicating requirements is through natural language.  \nHowever the use of natural language leads to ambiguity in interpretation (Greer et al. \n2003).  When a set of requirements has to be prepared by one organisation, such as an \nOEM, for another party, such as a supplier, then the scope for ambiguity is even more \napparent since the companies do not use a common vocabulary.  Such differences in the \nuse of language has been implicitly acknowledged by Renault as an issue during \ncollaborative product development (Jordan 2003).  In addition to errors resulting from \nambiguities, Hooks and Farry (2001) identify other errors that may be manifested: \n\u2022 Incorrect facts \n\u2022 Incorrect assumptions \n\u2022 Omissions \n\u2022 Inconsistencies \n\u2022 Misplacements \nDaimlerChrysler have piloted a set of requirement processes, methods and tools for \nautomotive electronic system development (Weber and Weisbrod 2003).  They found \nthat engineers often \u2018describe specifications in an unstructured way\u2019, this results in an \nincreased communication effort. DaimlerChrysler also identified that their requirements \nreuse for different variants was ad hoc and implicit since a good requirements \nspecification depended completely on an engineer\u2019s domain expertise (Weber and \nWeisbrod 2003).  The problems in the use of language and vocabulary for product \nrequirements can also be seen in the aerospace industry.  Kritsilis (2003) conducted a \ncase study of requirements management at an aeroengine OEM.  A principal reason for \ndifficulties in understanding requirements was the use of different terminologies for \nrequirements and their associated definitions.  This problem derived from the \n  7\ncompany\u2019s organisational practices where different \u2018internal businesses\u2019 tended to \ncreate their own development business processes together with the use of their own \njargon for describing features and attributes of the product.  On defining product \nrequirements, differences in terminology resulting from different perspectives \u2018restrict \nthe ability to convey product requirements from customers to designers\u2019 (Agouridas et \nal. 2001). \n \n5. A shared understanding of requirements through ontology \nAccording to Toye et al. (1993) design occurs as a result of reaching a \u2018shared \nunderstanding\u2019 of the design problem, the requirements and the process.  Such a shared \nunderstanding is reported by Hill et al. (2001) to be often manifested by the use of \n\u2018similar jargon in documentation\u2019.  To enable for product requirements information to \nbe shared in a concurrent engineering context there is the need to address the contextual \nmismatching of requirements vocabulary and the associated definitions.  Ontology \noffers a solution to this challenge, particularly in the context of a digital environment.  \n\u2018An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization\u2019, (Gruber 1993).  A \nconceptualization is a set of definitions that allows one to construct expressions about \nsome physical domain (Schreiber et al. 1995).  The explicit specification means that the \nconcepts and relationships of the abstract model are given explicit terms and definitions.  \nThis is effectively \u2018a formal and declarative representation\u2019, (Gruber and Olsen 1994, \nFikes 1997).  Fernandez-Breis and Martinez-Bejar (2000) state that an ontology \n\u2018enumerates the concepts that are relevant\u2019 in a domain.  Neches et al. (1991) state that \nan ontology \u2018defines the basic terms and relations comprising the vocabulary of a topic \narea\u2019.  Ontology is a \u2018content theory\u2019 (Chandrasekaran et al. 1999), it involves defining \n  8\nclasses of concepts and the relationships between these classes (Musen 1998).  The \nmajor benefit of ontology is, as identified by Jasper and Uschold (1999), to promote \n\u2018common understanding\u2019.  The goal of ontology is to strive towards \u2018consensual \nknowledge\u2019 through achieving a fixed terminology (Fernandez-Breis and Martinez-\nBejar 2002).  This involves the convergence of the different language representations to \na common format.  An ontology can therefore act as a strict work of reference when \ncommunicating requirements among both internal departments and external \norganisations up and down the supply chain. \nUsing Jasper and Uschold\u2019s (1999) framework for understanding and classifying \nontology applications, the Cranfield University electronic requirements management (e-\nRM) project is developing an \u2018ontology as specification\u2019 application for creating and \ndisseminating product requirements (Kerr et al. 2004, Roy et al. 2004).  This \napplication of the concept effectively means that ontologies are created and used for the \nspecification of automotive systems, modules and components.  The requirements \nknowledge encapsulated within an ontology includes product attributes, functions, \nrelations and constraints. \n \n[Insert figure 1 about here] \n \n6. Ontological-based requirements management tool \nTo realise the benefits of applying ontology for the domain of automotive product \nrequirements, an electronic requirements management (e-RM) framework has been \ndeveloped.  Figure 1 presents the conceptual model for the e-enabling product \nrequirements and their specification in an extended enterprise.  It is a hub and spoke \n  9\ndesign.  At the centre of the model is the hub which houses the core e-RM tool \nfunctionality.  This defines the user functions in terms of protocols for inputting \nrequirements data, searching, viewing, amending and deleting.  Provision is made to \nallow an OEM to tailor the hub of the e-RM tool to best suit their product definition and \ndevelopment business processes.  A vehicle can be decomposed into a number of \nsystems, as illustrated in figure 2, and the product requirements can be decomposed and \nassigned to each respective system.  For each of the systems, a product ontology can be \ndeveloped between the OEM and the respective supplier to provide a definition of the \nproduct requirements for elicitation and documentation purposes.  These ontology \nmodules can be made pluggable into the e-RM platform to form the global and local \nrequirements repositories.  Thus, around the hub are the spokes linking to the separate \npluggable ontologies for each of the different automotive systems that together form a \nvehicle, for example body-in-white, transmission, cockpit, interiors and electronics \n(figure 1).  The generating of the ontologies thus can be independently created using \nany of the commercially available ontology development tools.  This allows an OEM \nand their respective suppliers to both collaboratively and freely develop their own \nontologies for various and separate or common automotive systems.  The automotive \nOEM houses the global requirements management system.  This system is the one \nsingle source of product requirements information for a vehicle project and is based on \nontological structured global requirements repositories.  The structuring and \ndocumenting of the requirements is in a common standardized electronic format.  The \nOEM then allows their suppliers authorized access to the vehicle systems to which they \nare responsible for developing and manufacturing (figure 3).  Thus, the suppliers have a \n  10\nportion of this requirements data housed in their own local clients for internal \ndissemination in their respective organizations. \n \n[Insert figure 2 about here] \n \n[Insert figure 3 about here] \n \nTo achieve conceptual heterogeneity in the specification of an automotive system the \nuse of product ontology has been proposed as a means to realize a shared, formal and \ndeclarative representation of the product requirements.  As a proof-of-concept an \nontology case study has been developed.  The case study is for the specification of the \nseating system for a vehicle.  It encapsulates the product knowledge that is needed to \nspecify the entities, functions, attributes, constraints and relations of the seating \nassembly.  The ontology for the seating system was developed according to the \nguidelines proposed by Noy and McGuiness (2001).  Their knowledge-engineering \nmethodology for developing an ontology is illustrated in figure 4.  The first step was to \ndetermine the domain and scope of the ontology.  Then the important terms in the \nontology were enumerated.  This allowed the classes and the class hierarchy to be \ndetermined.  For each class, the properties are defined in the form of slots.  Finally, the \nfacets of the slots were defined.  The ontology editor used in this case study was \nProt\u00e9g\u00e9-2000 developed by the SMI group of Stanford University.  With Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, \nontologies are the basis for the generation of the knowledge bases and are used to \nspecify the knowledge representation and communication means for a domain.  To elicit \nthe information to produce the ontology a series of one-to-one semi-structured \n  11\ninterviews were conducted with personnel within an OEM, a Tier 1 seating system \nsupplier and two Tier 2 seating component suppliers.  The personnel interviewed were \nfrom the three principal stakeholder groups within each organization: Design, \nManufacturing and Purchasing.  In total 28 participants were interviewed.  The \nfollowing functional groups were represented: \n\u2022 Concepts \n\u2022 Design \n\u2022 Development \n\u2022 Purchasing \n\u2022 Cost Estimating \n\u2022 Projects \n\u2022 Homologation \n\u2022 Production Engineering \n\u2022 Materials \n\u2022 Test \n\u2022 Quality Assurance \n\u2022 Launch \n\u2022 Information Systems \n \n[Insert figure 4 about here] \n \nAll products are designed for a purpose and they must also be fit for that purpose.  \nProducts are often designed in a top-down manner (Schachinger and Johannesson 2000) \nand functional modeling is a direct method for representing the functionalities for a \n  12\ncomplete product.  This technique was used in the seat ontology as it provided a \nmechanism for the OEM and suppliers to agree, abstractly, the actual purpose and \nfunctionalities of the seating assembly that is to be designed and manufactured.  Figure \n5 shows part of the functional aspect of the seat ontology.  One of the important \nfunctionalities is that of positioning.  This encompasses positioning a potential \noccupant, the movement of the seat without an occupant (i.e. the pivoting to allow \naccess to the rear seats of a three door vehicle) and the movement source (i.e. manual or \npowered operation).  Consider for example the occupant positioning functionality, there \nis the need to allow a potential occupant to recline, slide and lift (raise\/lower) the seat.  \nFor these functionalities the ontology has captured the key design parameters that \nallows the OEM and suppliers to have a shared understanding of their specification.  \nFor example figure 6 shows the specification of the slider mechanism.  The principal \nspecification parameters are the inclination angle, travel length and pitch.  An ontology \ncan be used to design the structure of the requirements repository for a vehicle system.  \nThen for any given project, the repository can be populated with actual data and shared \nthrough out the Extended Enterprise. \n \n[Insert figure 5 about here] \n \n[Insert figure 6 about here] \n \nAdditionally, applying the ontology for the specification of a product allows the \nvehicle assembler and suppliers to work to a standard requirements vocabulary and the \nassociated definitions for each of the individual requirements.  Consider the viewpoint \n  13\nof a seated occupant.  The occupant must be safely and comfortably supported and \nrestrained.  Figure 7 depicts some of the safety features encapsulated by the seat \nontology.  These features are in a vocabulary shared between the OEM and the \nsuppliers.  Their associated definitions and key parameters for specification have been \nagreed between the stakeholders.  For example, an important safety feature is the \nheadrest as it protects an occupant\u2019s head and neck during a rear impact to minimize the \nseverity of injury, i.e. whiplash.  The OEM has basically a choice of two design options: \npassive (2-way) or active (4-way).  A passive headrest only has a vertical movement up \nand down, hence 2-way, whereas an active headrest has an additional longitudinal \nmovement (4-way).  The seat ontology states that to specify the degree of movement for \na passive headrest the OEM needs to make a decision on the travel length and pitch.  \nWhereas for an active headrest, the OEM would also need to specify the required tilt \nangle. \n \n[Insert figure 7 about here] \n \n[Insert figure 8 about here] \n \n[Insert figure 9 about here] \n \nThe developed ontology for the seating systems is in essence a database that stores \nthe requirements knowledge in a structured format and makes it available to the \nengineering designers.  The ontology is accessed through a front-end developed using \nVisual Basic .NET.  Consider the most fundamental functionalities that are available for \n  14\npositioning a seated occupant in a preferred posture, that is a seat can recline, slide and \nlift.  Using the dialog box presented in figure 8, each of these functionalities can be \nselected for each seat in the vehicle.  Additionally, there is the choice of whether the \nadjustment of these positioning functionalities should be manual or powered.  If the lift \noption is required for example, the engineering designer is shown the options for lifting \nthe seat (figure 9), i.e. lift only (just up and down \u2013 2-way) or lift and tilt (4-way).  If the \nmanual options have been selected for moving the seat, then the designer is able to \nselect the type of manual adjuster that should be used.  From figure 10 it can be seen \nthat the choice has been made for the seated occupant to use a handwheel adjuster to \nrecline their seat whereas a lever type in order to slide the seat back and forth.  The \ndecision to select a particular type of adjuster is actually based on the preference of \nfunctionality for the given region of sale for the new vehicle.  Europe has a preference \nfor the handwheel whereas Japan prefers the lever type adjuster.  Once an engineering \ndesigner selected the options in functionality, a series of dialog boxes are presented for \nentering the specification of the associated elements for each requirement.  Figure 11 \ndepicts the graphical user interface for specifying the requirements of the seat recliner \nand slider mechanisms. \n \n[Insert figure 10 about here] \n \n[Insert figure 11 about here] \n \n  15\n7. Conclusions \nAutomotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) are increasingly contracting \nout the design and manufacture of modular vehicle systems.  In this pan national \nExtended Enterprise environment the concurrent engineering process requires an \nunambiguous and communicable definition of the product that needs to de developed.  \nA set of complex product requirements requires the integration of information from \nvarious sources and formats.  The requirements are typically aggregated into a \ndocument and represented through natural language.  Often there are numerous \nnegotiations, discussions and clarifications between the OEM and suppliers to resolve \nambiguities in the interpretation of the product requirements.  To reach a shared \nconceptual understanding of requirements the application of ontology is proposed.  The \nontology presented can address the problems of contextual mismatching in the use of \nlanguage and associated definitions of these product requirements.  A conceptual model \nfor an ontological-based requirements management platform has been presented.  This \nmodel is of a \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 design.  This ontology can encapsulate the domain \nconcepts for specifying the requirements of a complex product in a pan national \nExtended Enterprise.  This functionality was illustrated through the presentation of an \nontology for a sub system of a passenger vehicle developed using a standard \nknowledge-engineering methodology.  The ontology represents the back-end of a \nknowledge-based tool that stores the product requirements knowledge in a structured \nformat.  User-friendly access to the domain knowledge embodied by the ontology is \nprovided through a series of dialogs that exploit the engineer\u2019s knowledge and support \nthe design decision processes. \n \n  16\nAcknowledgements \nThe authors acknowledge the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research \nCouncil (EPSRC); Nissan Technical Centre Europe, Johnson Controls Automotive, \nEDS and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) as the project \nsponsors; and the Decision Engineering Group, Enterprise Integration, Cranfield \nUniversity, UK. \n \nReferences \nAGOURIDAS, V., BAXTER, J., MCKAY, A. and DE PENNINGTON, A., 2001, On \ndefining product requirements: A case study in the UK health care sector.
