INTRODUCTION\nSuccessful models of supersymmetric (SUSY) inflation should ideally satisfy a number\nof requirements: natural compatibility with supergravity (SUGRA), lack of fine-tuned cou-\nplings, successful post-inflation era including reheating and baryogenesis, and compatibility\nwith unified models of particle physics. With respect to these conditions, SUSY hybrid\ninflation models have a particular attraction [1, 2]. They can achieve sufficient inflation\nwithout requiring very small or fine-tuned couplings, and in the case of D-term hybrid in-\nflation they are naturally compatible with SUGRA [3]. Focusing on the D-term inflation\ncase, a natural question is the origin of the fields in the D-term inflation sector. The U(1)\ngauge field and charged vector pair \u03a6\u00b1 of D-term inflation might be understood as compo-\nnents of an extended gauge theory. However, the inflaton is usually a gauge singlet which\nis added to the model for no other reason1. If we do not add such a singlet, can D-term\nhybrid inflation still occur? Here we argue that it can. The vector pair will naturally couple\nto any gauge-invariant combination of fields in the MSSM. Such gauge-invariant products\n(monomials) also characterise flat directions of the MSSM. Thus a natural possibility is that\na flat direction can play the role of the inflaton in D-term inflation models2. In this model\nthe number of additional fields required for inflation is reduced to just a U(1) gauge field\nand the \u03a6\u00b1 vector pair, so providing a minimal version of D-term inflation. As we will\nshow, conventional MSSM flat directions lifted by Planck scale-suppressed gauge-invariant\nsuperpotential terms are unsuitable. This is because such terms generally lift the flat di-\nrection scalar at field strengths well below the value required for inflation. However, it is\nknown that certain gauge-invariant superpotential terms must be suppressed by more than\nthe Planck scale or forbidden entirely. The d = 4 operators ucucdcec and QQQL will lead to\nrapid proton decay if they are only Planck scale-suppressed [9]. One way this problem can be\nsolved is by assuming that the underlying complete theory introduces a dynamical suppres-\nsion factor into the non-renormalisable superpotential interactions, such that the effective\nmass scale suppressing the dangerous operators is \u039b >\u223c 10\n26 GeV [9]. It is also possible that\n1 Models exist which attempt to identify the inflaton with a known field, such as a right-handed sneutrino\n[4, 5, 6].\n2 An interesting model using MSSM flat directions as inflatons, which has a quite different philosophy with\nrespect to fine-tunings, is given in [7]. See also [8].\n2\nthis dynamical suppression will also apply to all higher-order MSSM superpotential terms\nlifting the flat direction, such as (ucucdcec)2 and (QQQL)2. We will refer to a flat direction\nfor which this is true as an \u2018extra-flat direction\u2019. An alternative interpretation of the absence\nof proton decay is in terms of a discrete symmetry which eliminates the dangerous d = 4 op-\nerators [10]. In this case it is possible that the higher-order operators will be unsuppressed.\nHowever, as we will show, such unsuppressed flat directions, even if higher-order, cannot\nserve as an inflaton. If the existence of extra-flat directions is the correct interpretation of\nthe absence of proton decay in the MSSM, then an extra-flat direction scalar could serve\nas the inflaton in a D-term inflation model. The extra-flat direction potential at large field\nvalues is naturally lifted to an inflationary plateau by its gauge-invariant superpotential\ncoupling to \u03a6+\u03a6\u2212. Reheating and possibly baryogenesis would then come from the decay of\nthe flat direction inflaton, via either Q-ball decay or conventional homogeneous condensate\ndecay, depending on the t squark component of the flat direction. In this paper we will\nstudy D-term inflation along an extra-flat direction of the MSSM. The paper is organised\nas follows. In Section 2 we discuss extra-flat directions and the resulting D-term inflation\nmodel. In Section 3 we discuss reheating and baryogenesis. In Section 4 we present our\nconclusions.\nII. D-TERM INFLATON ALONG EXTRA-FLAT DIRECTIONS\nA. Potential\nWe consider a flat direction \u03a6 in the MSSM and introduce two additional fields \u03a6\u00b1\ncharged under a U(1) gauge group with the Fayet-Illiopoulos term \u03be. The superpotential is\nW =\n\u03bb1\u03a6\nm\nmMm\u22123\n+\n\u03bb2\u03a6\nn\nnMn\u22121\n\u03a6+\u03a6\u2212 , (1)\n3\nwhere \u03bb1,2 are Yukawa couplings and M is the reduced Planck mass, M =MP l\/\n\u221a\n8\u03c0 3. We\nwill present results for general m and n, specialising to the case of most interest m = n = 4,\ncorresponding to \u03a64 \u223c ucucdcec or QQQL. Proton stability in the case of ucucdcec or\nQQQL requires that \u03bb1\n<\n\u223c 10\n\u22128, corresponding to an effective suppression mass scale \u039b =\nM\/\u03bb1\n>\n\u223c 10\n26 GeV. However, \u03bb2 is unconstrained by phenomenology and will be determined\nby the inflation model. The scalar potential in the global SUSY limit is then\nV =\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03bb2\u03c6nnMn\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n(|\u03c6+|2 + |\u03c6\u2212|2) +\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22121Mm\u22123 + \u03bb2\u03c6\nn\u22121\nMn\u22121\n\u03c6+\u03c6\u2212\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n+\ng2\n2\n(\u03be + |\u03c6+|2 \u2212 |\u03c6\u2212|2)2. (2)\nThe supersymmetric global minimum is located at4\n(\u03c6, \u03c6+, |\u03c6\u2212|) = (0, 0,\n\u221a\n\u03be). (3)\nIf \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03bb2\u03c6m+n\u22122Mm+n\u22124\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n\u226a (g2\u03be)2 (4)\nis satisfied, the mixing between \u03c6+ and \u03c6\u2212 is negligible. The potential is then simplified to\nV \u2243\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03bb2\u03c6nnMn\u22121\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n(|\u03c6+|2 + |\u03c6\u2212|2) +\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22121Mm\u22123\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n+\ng2\n2\n(\u03be + |\u03c6+|2 \u2212 |\u03c6\u2212|2)2. (5)\nThe critical value of \u03c6 is given by\n|\u03c6c| \u2261\n(\nnMn\u22121\n\u221a\ng2\u03be\n|\u03bb2|\n)1\/n\n, (6)\nwhich determines the stability of the \u03c6\u2212 field at the origin. The origin is a false vacuum for\n|\u03c6| > |\u03c6c|, while it is unstable for |\u03c6| < |\u03c6c|.\n3 A SUSY mass term W \u2283 \u00b5\u03a6+\u03a6\u2212 has not been included. This term would induce n minima with\nnonvanishing VEV for \u03a6, which consist of squark and\/or slepton VEV and lead to large baryon or lepton\nnumber violation in the MSSM. Although in most cases there is no symmetry which can exclude such a\nterm, we note that for the case m = n this term can be excluded by an R-symmetry which allows the\nterms \u03a6n and \u03a6n\u03a6+\u03a6\u2212. In addition, if \u00b5 is less than the scale of soft SUSY breaking terms, the minimum\nof the potential can be at \u03a6 = 0, while for larger \u00b5 there can be directions in the complex \u03a6 plane along\nwhich the field evolution can avoid the minima with \u03a6 6= 0.\n4 Note that there is a SUSY flat direction when \u00b5 = 0 and \u03c6 = 0, such that |\u03c6+|2 \u2212 |\u03c6\u2212|2 = \u03be. However,\nthe minimum with \u03c6+ = 0 is selected since \u03c6+ gains a large mass when \u03c6 6= 0 during inflation.\n4\nB. Inflationary expansion\nFor |\u03c6| > |\u03c6c|, \u03c6\u2212 = 0 is a local minimum and there is the false vacuum energy from the\nD-term, which drives inflation. The potential during inflation is given as\nV \u2243 1\n2\ng2\u03be2\n(\n1 +\ng2\n8\u03c02\nln\n\u03c32n\n\u039b2n\u2217\n)\n, (7)\nwhere \u03c3 =\n\u221a\n2Re(\u03c6) is the canonically normalised inflaton and \u039b\u2217 is the renormalisation\nscale. Inflation ends when the inflaton reaches the larger of \u03c3c \u2261\n\u221a\n2|\u03c6rmc| and\n\u03c3f \u2261\n\u221a\nngM\n2\u03c0\n, (8)\nwhere \u03c3f corresponds to the end of slow-roll. However, a non-vanishing F-term potential is\nalso present in this model. Hence, we need to ensure that the condition VF \u226a VD is satisfied,\nwhich requires that \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22121Mm\u22123\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n\u226a 1\n2\ng2\u03be2 (9)\nis satisfied. Note that when this is satisfied, equation (4) is also satisfied. The dynamics of\nthe inflaton field is similar to that in the minimal D-term hybrid inflation model [1]. The\nsolution of the slow-roll field equations is\n\u03c32(N) = \u03c320 +\nng2NM2\n2\u03c02\n. (10)\nHere, \u03c30 = max[\u03c3f , \u03c3c] is the expectation value of inflaton when inflation terminates. The\nspectral index is\nns = 1\u2212 1\nN\n(\n1 +\n2\u03c02\u03c320\nng2M2N\n)\u22121\n, (11)\nwhile the value of \u03be1\/2 normalised to the curvature perturbation P\u03b6 is\n\u03be1\/2\nM\n=\n(\n3nP\u03b6\nN\n)1\/4(\n1 +\n2\u03c02\u03c320\nng2M2N\n)\u22121\/4\n. (12)\nIn the case of \u03c30 = \u03c3c, which we will show is true in examples of interest, we find\n2\u03c02\u03c320\nng2M2N\n=\n(\n\u03bb2c\n\u03bb2\n)2\/n\n(13)\nwith\n\u03bb2c =\n(\n4\u03c02\nng2NM2\n)n\/2 (\ng2\u03ben2M2(n\u22121)\n)1\/2\n. (14)\n5\n\u03bb2 = \u03bb2c corresponds to \u03c3N = 2\u03c3c, with \u03c3 \u2248 \u03c3c throughout inflation when \u03bb2 < \u03bb2c . When\n\u03bb2 \u226b \u03bb2c as well as the case of \u03c30 = \u03c3c, the spectral index is ns = 1 \u2212 1\/N \u2248 0.98, as in\nconventional D-term inflation, while the value of \u03be1\/2 required to account for the observed\ncurvature perturbation (P\n1\/2\n\u03b6 = 4.8\u00d710\u22125) is \u03be1\/2 = 7.9\u00d71015n1\/4 GeV. On the other hand,\nin the case where \u03bb2 \u226a \u03bb2c , the spectral index approaches ns = 1 while the value of \u03be1\/2 is\nreduced by a factor (\u03bb2\/\u03bb2c)\n1\/2n.\nC. Comparison with observations\nThe spectral index observed by WMAP, ns = 0.958 \u00b1 0.016 (1-\u03c3) [11], is substantially\nsmaller the D-term inflation value. In addition, WMAP data permits at most an O(10)%\ncontribution to the CMB power spectrum from cosmic strings [12, 13, 14], which implies\nthat \u03be1\/2 <\u223c 4 \u00d7 1015 GeV. (Here we have used G\u00b5 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 for the l = 10 WMAP\nnormalised string tension [15].) One way to interpret the WMAP observations is that they\ncorrespond to an adiabatic curvature perturbation with ns \u2248 1 combined with a 10% cosmic\nstring contribution [16], which can be achieved by making \u03bb2 sufficiently small compared\nwith \u03bb2c . In this case the apparent spectral index of the combined perturbation is effectively\nlowered and can be in agreement with the 3-year WMAP data analysis [16]. It is a striking\nfeature of D-term inflation models in general that they have a solution which increases ns\nwhile decreasing the cosmic string contribution, just as required for this interpretation of the\nWMAP observations. With respect to this possibility, the extra-flat direction model has a\npossible advantage over conventional D-term inflation. The contribution of cosmic strings to\nthe CMB power spectrum is proportional to \u00b52 = (2\u03c0\u03be)2. In the case of conventional D-term\ninflation with ns = 1, the value of \u03be\n2 in the limit \u03bb2 \u226a \u03bb2c is proportional to \u03bb22. Therefore\n\u03bb2 must lie within a rather narrow range of values for the cosmic string contribution to be\nO(10)%. In the case of the extra-flat direction inflaton, the dependence is \u221d \u03bb2\/n2 . Therefore\nthe CMB contribution varies much more gradually with \u03bb2 e.g. \u03be\n2 \u221d \u03bb1\/22 for the case n = 4.\nThus an O(10)% contribution is obtained for a much wider range of \u03bb2, making it perhaps\na more natural possibility than in conventional D-term inflation.\n6\nD. Constraints from cosmic string bound, SUGRA and potential flatness\nWe first check that the 10% cosmic string condition \u03be1\/2 \u2248 4\u00d71015 GeV can be satisfied for\nreasonable values of g when |\u03c6c|2 is small enough compared withM2 for SUGRA corrections\nto be neglected. We will require that |\u03c6c| < kM , with k <\u223c 0.3, so that |\u03c6c|2 <\u223c 0.1M2. From\nequation (6), this implies that\ng <\u223c\n\u03bb2k\nnM\nn\u03be1\/2\n. (15)\nFor the case n = 4 and \u03be1\/2 \u2248 4\u00d7 1015 GeV, equation (15) implies that\ng <\u223c 1.2\u03bb2\n(\nk\n0.3\n)4\n. (16)\nThus \u03bb2 should not be small compared with 1 if g is not very small compared with 1. From\nequation (12), to suppress \u03be1\/2 from 7.9\u00d7 1015 GeV to 4 \u00d7 1015 GeV in the case n = 4 we\nrequire that \u03bb2c\/\u03bb2 \u2248 250, which implies that\n\u03bb2 \u2248 8\u00d7 10\u22127g\u22123 . (17)\nEquations (16) and (17) imply that\ng <\u223c 0.03\n(\nk\n0.3\n)\n(18)\nand\n\u03bb2\n>\n\u223c 0.03\n(\n0.3\nk\n)3\n. (19)\nThus k >\u223c 0.1 is necessary when \u03bb2\n<\n\u223c 1 in order to satisfy equation (19). 0.1\n<\n\u223c k\n<\n\u223c 0.3\nthen implies that g \u2248 0.01\u2212 0.03 and 0.03 <\u223c \u03bb2 <\u223c 1. Therefore, as in conventional D-term\ninflation in the small coupling limit, g must be somewhat smaller than the Standard Model\ngauge couplings [13]. In addition, \u03bb2 must be much larger than \u03bb1\n5. We next evaluate\nEq. (9) to find the condition on \u03bb1 for F-term corrections not to spoil the flatness of the\ninflaton potential. In general we find\n\u03bb1 \u226a 1\u221a\n2\ng\u03be\nkm\u22121M2\n. (20)\n5 We have assumed that \u03c3c > \u03c3f . For the case n = 4 this requires that \u03be\n1\/2\/M > |\u03bb2|g3\/pi4. With\n\u03be1\/2 \u2248 4\u00d7 1015 GeV and g \u2248 0.02 this is easily satisfied.\n7\nFor the case m = 4 this gives\n\u03bb1 \u226a 7\u00d7 10\u22125g\n(\n0.3\nk\n)3(\n\u03be1\/2\n4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n)2\n. (21)\nThus for values of \u03bb1 which satisfy the proton decay constraint, \u03bb1\n<\n\u223c 10\n\u22128, the flat direction\npotential is easily sufficiently flat to serve as an inflaton. However, for the case of unsup-\npressed n = m = 4 flat directions with \u03bb1 \u223c 1, the F-term would violate the flatness of the\nflat-direction inflaton potential. An alternative solution of the proton decay problem is to\nconsider elimination of the m = n = 4 operators entirely by a symmetry. In this case we\nexpect to have unsuppressed operators with m = n = 8, such that \u03bb1 \u223c \u03bb2 \u223c 1. However,\nin this case the F-flatness condition will still be violated. For n = 8, equation (15) implies\nthat\ng <\u223c 5\u00d7 10\u22123\u03bb2\n(\nk\n0.3\n)8\n. (22)\nTo suppress \u03be1\/2 to 4\u00d7 1015 GeV, with n = 8 we need \u03bb2c\/\u03bb2 \u2248 6.5\u00d7 104. This implies that\n\u03bb2 = 9\u00d7 10\u221212g\u22127 . (23)\nTherefore if \u03bb2\n<\n\u223c 1 we have g\n>\n\u223c 0.03. Equation (23) combined with equation (22) gives\ng <\u223c 0.02\n(\nk\n0.3\n)\n. (24)\nThus k >\u223c 0.5 is necessary if g\n>\n\u223c 0.03. The F-term flatness condition equation (20) for m = 8\nis\n\u03bb1\n<\n\u223c 8\u00d7 10\u22126\n( g\n0.03\n)(0.5\nk\n)7(\n\u03be1\/2\n4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n)2\n. (25)\nThus the m = n = 8 flat direction will also need to be extra-suppressed to have a flat\ninflaton potential, even if the m = n = 4 term is completely eliminated by a discrete\nsymmetry. Therefore extra-flat directions are essential for an MSSM flat direction to play\nthe role of the inflaton in D-term inflation.\nE. Post-inflationary evolution\nIncluding soft SUSY breaking terms, the potential is\nV = m2\u03c6|\u03c6|2 + Am3\/2\n\u03bb1\u03c6\nm\nmMm\u22123\n+H.c.\n+g2\u03be|\u03c6\u2212|2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03c6\u03c6c\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2n\n+\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22121Mm\u22123\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n+\ng2\n2\n(\u03be \u2212 |\u03c6\u2212|2)2, (26)\n8\nwhere we used equation (6). Here m2\u03c6 is the soft SUSY breaking scalar mass. The potential\nhas two SUSY non-renormalisable terms: the third term g2\u03be2(|\u03c6\u2212|2\/\u03be)|\u03c6n\/\u03c6nc |2 and the\nfourth term |\u03bb1\u03c6m\/Mm\u22123|2. Assuming that m \u2212 1 < n (since the case of most interest will\nbe that where m = n), the third term is dominant if \u03c6 & \u03c6\u2217, where\n\u03c6n\u2212m+1\u2217 \u2261\n\u03bb1\u03c6\nn\nc\nMm\u22123\n\u221a\ng2\u03be2\n(\n\u03be\n|\u03c6\u2212|2\n)1\/2\n, (27)\nwhile the fourth term is dominant if \u03c6 < \u03c6\u2217. An important point in what follows is that\nfor \u03c6 >\u223c \u03c6\u2217, the A-term will be effectively suppressed compared with the usual case of an\nMSSM flat direction with potential stabilised by a non-renormalisable term. This is because\nthe A-term is coming from the first term in the superpotential, equation (1), whereas the\nnon-renormalisable term in the scalar potential is from the second term. As a result, the\nbaryon asymmetry generated by the Affleck-Dine mechanism [17, 18] will be suppressed\nrelative to the MSSM flat direction case. Once inflation ends, the \u03c6\u2212 field oscillates around\nthe minimum \u3008\u03c6\u2212\u3009 =\n\u221a\n\u03be 6. The \u03c6 field will oscillate around the origin dominated by either\nthe |\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22121\/Mm\u22123|2 or the |\u3008\u03c6\u2212\u3009|2g2\u03be|\u03c6n\/\u03c6nc |2 term, depending on the amplitude. While\nthe amplitude of the \u03c6 oscillation is large, the energy density of \u03c6 will decrease more rapidly\nthan that of \u03c6\u2212 (V \u221d \u03c6d implies that \u03c1 \u221d a\u22126d\/(d+2), with d \u2265 6 for \u03c6 oscillations and d = 2\nfor \u03c6\u2212 oscillations), so the Universe initially becomes \u03c6\u2212 dominated. In the following we will\nassume that the \u03c6\u2212 oscillations efficiently decay into radiation. (We will comment on how\nour results are altered if this is not satisfied.) Due to the \u03c6\u2212 decay, the radiation produces\ntwo distinct thermal corrections to the potential equation (26). The \u03c6 field is expected to\nacquire a thermal mass term\nh2T 2|\u03c6|2 , (28)\nwith h being a coupling between \u03c6 and a particle in the thermal bath [19] in the case where\nthe expectation value of the field is relatively small and the radiation temperature is high\nenough, and also a logarithmic term\n\u03b1T 4 ln\n|\u03c6|2\nT 2\n, (29)\nwhich appears at the two-loop level through the running of couplings with non-vanishing\n\u03c6 [20]. Here, \u03b1 is a constant of order of 10\u22122 and its sign can be positive or negative. For\n6 In general, the minimum of the potential is at |\u03c6\u2212| = \u03be1\/2\n(\n1\u2212 |\u03c6\/\u03c6c|2n\n)1\/2\n. This rapidly tends to\n|\u03c6\u2212| = \u03be1\/2 as the \u03c6 oscillations are damped from \u03c6c to small amplitudes.\n9\nour purpose, hereafter we consider the case that \u03b1 is negative. (For a positive \u03b1, the field\noscillates around the origin by either the mass m\u03c6, the thermal mass or this two-loop effect\nand simply decays into radiation.) The potential with the two-loop induced logarithmic\npotential is\nV (\u03c6) = m2\u03c6\n(\n1 +K ln\n|\u03c6|2\n\u039b2\n)\n|\u03c6|2 + Am3\/2 \u03bb1\u03c6\nm\nmMm\u22123\n+H.c. + \u03b1T 4 ln\n|\u03c6|2\nT 2\n+g2\u03be|\u03c6\u2212|2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6n\u03c6nc\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n+\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22121Mm\u22123\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n, (30)\nwhere we include the radiative correction to m\u03c6 with the direction dependent coefficient K.\nFor MSSM flat directions which do not include a large top quark component, K \u2243 \u221210\u22122\n[21, 22]. However, a large top squark component can drive K to positive values.\nA negative K is the source of the spatial instability which leads to Q-ball formation in\nthe gravity mediated SUSY breaking model [21]. For a negative \u03b1, as shown in Ref. [23],\nthe thermal mass term cannot appear because of a relatively large expectation value of\nthe field. Here, the \u03c6 field is trapped with nonvanishing value by the thermal logarithmic\nterm, equation (29), and the non-renormalizable term, until the temperature decreases to a\ncertain value. As the temperature falls, the expectation value of \u03c6 becomes small. When\nthe \u03c6 becomes as small as\n|\u03c6os|2 \u2243 (\u2212\u03b1)T\n4\nm2\u03c6\n, (31)\n\u03c6 starts to oscillate around the origin with the angular momentum in the \u03c6 space induced\nby A-term, which is equivalent to the charge density (baryonic and\/or leptonic) carried by\n\u03c6 [17]. Provided that the reheating by the \u03c6\u2212 decay is completed before \u03c6 starts to oscillate,\nwe find from equation (31) that\n\u03c1\u03c6\n\u03c1R\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ntos\n\u2243 30(\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03c02g\u2217\n. (32)\nHere, g\u2217 is the effective total degrees of freedom of the relativistic species in the radiation.\nSince the ratio in equation (32) is of order of 10\u22124, the \u03c6 field oscillations (or the Q-ball\ndensity formed from the \u03c6 condensate if K < 0) soon dominates the Universe.\nIII. REHEATING AND BARYOGENESIS\nReheating in this model is from the decay of the extra-flat direction inflaton field. The\nreheating temperature will therefore depend on whether or not the flat direction condensate\n10\nfragments into Q-balls, which in turn depends on the t squark content of the flat direction\n[22].\nA. Q-ball formation and decay\nThe \u03c6 field oscillates around the origin coherently to begin with, but there is a spatial\ninstability of its fluctuations due to the negative K. After inhomogeneities in the field grow,\nthe coherent \u03c6 fragments and, as a result, Q-balls are formed [21, 24]. Here we briefly\nsummarize properties of Q-balls in gravity mediated SUSY breaking models. The radius of\na Q-ball, R, is estimated as R2 \u2243 2\/(|K|m2\u03c6) [21]. By numerical calculations, it was shown\nthat almost all the produced charge is stored inside Q-balls, and that a good fit to the Q-ball\ncharge is\nQ \u2243 \u03b2\u00af\n( |\u03c6os|\nm\u03c6\n)2\n\u01ebQ (33)\nwith\n\u01ebQ =\n\uf8f1\uf8f2\n\uf8f3 \u01eb for \u01eb & \u01ebc\u01ebc for \u01eb < \u01ebc , (34)\nand\n\u01eb \u2261 nq\nn\u03c6\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\ntos\n\u2243 2q|A|\n(\nm3\/2\nm\u03c6\n)\nsin \u03b4 \u00d7Min\n[(\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb1 \u2217\n)\n, 1\n](\nm\u03c6\nHos\n)\n, (35)\nwhere \u03b4 is the CP violating phase, \u01ebc \u2243 10\u22122 and \u03b2\u00af = 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 [25]. (For \u01eb < \u01ebc the\ncondensate will fragment to pairs of oppositely charged Q-balls.) The last two factors in\nequation (35) are, respectively, the suppression of the baryon asymmetry due to the effective\nsuppression of the A-term relative to the non-renormalisable term once \u03c6 >\u223c \u03c6\u2217 (where \u03bb1 \u2217 is\ndefined below), and the enhancement due to Hos \u226a m\u03c6 at the onset of \u03c6 oscillations, which\nallows the B violating A-term to act over many \u03c6 oscillations before expansion diminishes\nthe A-term7.\nThe decay temperature of Q-ball is given by [26]\nTd \u2243 1\n\u221a\nfs\n( m\u03c6\n1TeV\n)1\/2(1020\nQ\n)1\/2\nGeV, (36)\n7 In the case where the \u03c6\u2212 field does not decay efficiently to radiation, the Universe after inflation will\nbe dominated by \u03c6\u2212 oscillations and onset of oscillations will be typically determined by an order H\n2\ncorrection to the \u03c6 mass squared due to non-minimal Ka\u00a8hler interactions of the form |\u03c6\u2212|2|\u03c6|2. In this\ncase m\u03c6 \u2248 Hos in Eq. (35).\n11\nwhere 103 & fs \u2265 1 is the enhancement factor in the decay if Q-balls can decay into final\nstates consisting purely of scalar particles. Since Q-balls come to dominate the Universe in\nour scenario, the decay temperature gives the reheating temperature at the onset of radiation\ndominated Universe. The resultant emitted charge to entropy ratio is given by\nnq\ns\n=\n3\n4\nTd\nm\u03c6\n\u01eb. (37)\nB. Affleck-Dine baryogenesis\nThe baryon asymmetry is generated by the B and CP violating A-term when \u03c6 starts to\noscillate around the origin [17]. As usual inD-term inflation, there is no orderH correction to\nthe A-term before \u03c6 starts oscillating, since \u03c6+ = 0 throughout [27]. In addition, in the case\nof a non-singlet inflaton there can be no linear coupling of the inflaton I to superpotential\nmonomials W in the Ka\u00a8hler potential of the form I\u2020W , which would generate an order H\nA-term correction [18]. Therefore the phase of the inflaton relative to the A-term at the\nonset of \u03c6 oscillations, \u03b8, is determined by its initial random value during inflation, in which\ncase sin \u03b4 \u2248 (sin 2\u03b8)\/2. This phase gives the CP violating phase required for Affleck-Dine\nbaryogenesis, with nB \u221d \u03b8 for \u03b8 small compared with 1. In the estimation of the resultant\nbaryon asymmetry produced by the Affleck-Dine mechanism, the important quantity is the\namplitude of the AD field when it starts to oscillate, \u03c6os. For \u03c6os\n>\n\u223c \u03c6\u2217, the amplitude is\ngiven by\nm2\u03c6 \u2243 ng2\u03be2\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03c6n\u22121os\u03c6nc\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n, (38)\nwhere we assume |\u03c6\u2212|2 = \u03be. On the other hand, for \u03c6os <\u223c \u03c6\u2217, the amplitude is given by\nm2\u03c6 \u2243 (m\u2212 1)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bb1\u03c6m\u22122osMm\u22123\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\n2\n. (39)\nThe former applies in the case of a small \u03bb1\n<\n\u223c \u03bb1 \u2217, with\n\u03bb\n(n\u22121)\n1 \u2217 \u2261\n(\u221a\ng2\u03be2\n|\u03c6c|n\n)m\u22122(\nm2\u03c6\nn\n)n\u2212m+1\n2\nM (m\u22123)(n\u22121), (40)\nwhile the latter corresponds to a large \u03bb1\n>\n\u223c \u03bb1 \u2217. For the case \u03bb1\n<\n\u223c \u03bb1 \u2217 we obtain\n|\u03c6os|2\nm2\u03c6\n=\n(\n1\nng2\u03be2\n|\u03c6c|2n\nm\n2(n\u22122)\n\u03c6\n) 1\nn\u22121\n. (41)\n12\nEquation (33) then gives\nQ \u2243 \u03b2\u00af\n(\n1\nng2\u03be2\n|\u03c6c|2n\nm\n2(n\u22122)\n\u03c6\n) 1\nn\u22121\n\u01ebQ. (42)\nThe expansion rate at the onset of \u03c6 oscillations during radiation domination can be\nobtained from equations (31) and (41),\nHos\nm\u03c6\n=\n(\n\u03c02g\u2217\n90\u03b1\n)1\/2 |\u03c6os|\nM\n, (43)\nwith\n|\u03c6os|\nM\n=\n(\u221a\nnm\u03c6\n\u03bb2\u03be1\/2\n) 1\nn\u22121\n. (44)\nFor n = 4 this gives,\nHos\nm\u03c6\n\u2248 4\u00d7 10\u22124\u03b1\u22121\/2\u03bb\u22121\/32\n( m\u03c6\n1 TeV\n)1\/3(4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n\u03be1\/2\n)1\/3\n. (45)\nTherefore Hos\/m\u03c6 \u2248 10\u22123. This justifies neglect of H corrections to the soft SUSY breaking\nterms at the onset of \u03c6 oscillations.\nFor n = 4, equation (42) becomes\nQ \u2243 1.1\u00d7 1021\n(\n0.1\ng\n)2\/3(\n4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n\u03be1\/2\n)4\/3( |\u03c6c|\n0.3M\n)8\/3(\n1TeV\nm\u03c6\n)4\/3\n\u01ebQ. (46)\nThen from equations (36), (37) and (46), and using m\u03c6\/Hos \u2248 103, the decay temperature\nand baryon asymmetry are given by\nTd \u2243 3\n\u221a\nfs\n(\n0.1\u221a\n\u01ebQ\n)( m\u03c6\n1TeV\n)7\/6(0.1\ng\n)\u22121\/3(\n4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n\u03be1\/2\n)\u22122\/3( |\u03c6c|\n0.3M\n)\u22124\/3\nGeV, (47)\nand\nnq\ns\n\u2243 2\u00d710\u221210\n(\n0.1\u221a\n\u01ebQ\n)( \u01eb\n10\u22127\n)\u221a\nfs\n( m\u03c6\n1TeV\n)1\/6(0.1\ng\n)\u22121\/3(\n4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n\u03be1\/2\n)\u22122\/3( |\u03c6c|\n0.3M\n)\u22124\/3\n.\n(48)\nThe observed baryon asymmetry is nq\/s = (1.8\u00b1 0.1)\u00d7 10\u221210. Hence \u01eb <\u223c 10\u22127 is necessary\nto account for the observed B asymmetry. The Q-ball decay temperature, which gives the\nreheating temperature, is in the range 3-100 GeV for 1 \u2264 fs <\u223c 103. For \u03bb1 <\u223c \u03bb1 \u2217, from\nequation (35) we have \u01eb \u2248 (0.1 \u2212 1)(\u03bb1\/\u03bb1 \u2217)(m\u03c6\/Hos)\u03b8. The random phase of \u03c6 during\ninflation would be expected to be of order 1; therefore in order to generate the observed\nbaryon asymmetry we require that \u03bb1 \u2248 (10\u221210 \u2212 10\u22129)\u03bb1 \u2217. With m = n = 4, \u03bb1 \u2217 is,\n\u03bb1\u2217 \u2243 3.3\u00d7 10\u22128\n( m\u03c6\n1TeV\n)1\/3(4\u00d7 1015 GeV\n\u03be1\/2\n)\u22122\/3\n\u03bb\n2\/3\n2 . (49)\n13\nSince \u03bb2 should not be very small if g is not very small, \u03bb1 \u2217 \u2248 10\u22128 is likely. Therefore\nto account for the observed baryon asymmetry with \u03b8 \u2248 1 we must have \u03bb1 <\u223c 10\u221217. This\ncorresponds to suppression of the QQQL or ucucdcec superpotential terms by a mass scale\n\u039b >\u223c 10\n35 GeV. Thus a much larger suppression is necessary for successful baryogenesis\nthan is required by proton stability. Note that it may be possible for Q-balls to decay at\na temperature greater than that of the electroweak transition if fs \u2248 103, corresponding to\nQ-ball decay to purely scalar final states. In this case any dangerous baryon asymmetry will\nbe erased by B + L violating sphaleron fluctuations.\nC. Baryon isocurvature perturbations\nThe CP violating phase \u03b4 is given by the phase of \u03c6 during inflation relative to the\nA-term, which defines the real direction. Therefore in the case where reheating is via Q-\nball decay, \u01eb \u2248 102(\u03bb1\/\u03bb1 \u2217)\u03b8 implies that \u03b8 \u2248 10\u22129(\u03bb1 \u2217\/\u03bb1) in order to have \u01eb \u2248 10\u22127, as\nrequired for successful baryogenesis with fs = 1. Quantum fluctuations of \u03c6 in the phase\ndirection will lead to baryon isocurvature perturbations, which can be large when \u03b8 \u226a 1.\nFor uncorrelated baryon isocurvature perturbations, the fractional contribution to the CMB\npower spectrum is given by \u03b1BI, where [28, 29]\n\u03b1BI =\n(\n\u2126B\n\u2126DM\n)2\nf 2\u03b8H\n2\n4\u03c02PR\u03c62\n, (50)\nwith \u03b4nB\/nB \u2248 f\u03b8\u03b4\u03b8. In our case f\u03b8 \u2248 1\/\u03b8. The present observational limit is \u03b1BI < 0.26\n[30]. With \u03b8 \u2248 10\u22129(\u03bb1 \u2217\/\u03bb1), \u2126DM = 0.23 and \u2126B = 0.04, this gives a upper bound on H\/\u03c6,\nH\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n<\n\u223c 10\n\u221213\n(\n\u03bb1 \u2217\n\u03bb1\n)\n. (51)\n\u03be1\/2 \u2248 4 \u00d7 1015 GeV, corresponding to O(10)% cosmic strings, implies that H = 2.7 \u00d7\n1012g GeV. Since we are considering \u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6c \u2248 (0.1\u2212 0.3)M , we therefore have\nH\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n\u2248 (0.6\u2212 1.8)\u00d7 10\u22126g , (52)\nThus with g \u2248 0.01 \u2212 0.03, the baryon isocurvature perturbation is sufficiently small if\n\u03bb1\/\u03bb1 \u2217\n<\n\u223c 10\n\u22125. The correct baryon asymmetry then requires that \u03b8 >\u223c 10\n\u22124. Thus even if the\ninitial random phase of the flat direction field could satisfy \u03b8 \u226a 1, the flat direction would\nstill have to be suppressed by \u039b >\u223c 10\n31 GeV in order to avoid large baryon isocurvature\n14\nperturbations. For \u039b \u2248 1031 GeV and \u03b8 \u2248 10\u22124, the correct baryon asymmetry will be\ngenerated together with a potentially observable baryon isocurvature perturbation.\nD. Non-thermal dark matter\nThe reheating temperature is \u2248 1 GeV for the case where Q-ball decay to purely scalar\nfinal states is kinematically suppressed, such that fs = 1. This low reheating temperature\nimplies that Q-balls may decay below the freeze-out temperature of neutralino LSPs, in\nwhich case Q-ball decay will also produce non-thermal LSP dark matter particles. In fact\ndark matter particles are often overproduced, in particular for the standard bino-like neu-\ntralino LSP. Although several ways to avoid this problem have been proposed by taking an\nalternative choice of the LSP [23, 31, 32, 33], perhaps the simplest ones are to assume a\nHiggsino-like neutralino LSP [32], or a gravitino LSP [23] with a sneutrino NLSP to escape\nBBN constraints [34].\nE. Reheating from flat direction condensate decay without Q-ball formation\nIn the case where the inflaton corresponds to a flat direction with a large t squark compo-\nnent, the \u03c6 condensate will not fragment to Q-balls since K > 0 [22]. In this case reheating\nwill occur via conventional flat direction condensate decay and a higher reheating temper-\nature is expected. For the B \u2212 L conserving ucucdcec and QQQL directions, the baryon\nasymmetry from Affleck-Dine baryogenesis will be erased by sphaleron B + L violation so\nlong as the \u03c6 condensate decays at T > Tew. In this case it is possible for the initial phase\nof \u03c6 to take its natural value, \u03b8 \u2248 1, without requiring a suppression of the flat direction\nbeyond that required to evade proton decay. Assuming that \u03c6 oscillations dominate the en-\nergy density when the \u03c6 field decays to radiation, the energy density is given by \u03c1 \u2248 m2\u03c6\u03c62d,\nwhere \u03c6d is the amplitude of the oscillations when they decay. |\u03c6d| is then related to the\ndecay temperature Td by\n|\u03c6d|2 = kdT\n4\nd\nm2\u03c6\n; kd =\n\u03c02g(Td)\n30\n. (53)\nFor h|\u03c6d| > m\u03c6, where h is the gauge or Yukawa coupling of MSSM particles to the flat\ndirection, particles coupling to \u03c6 gain masses greater thanm\u03c6 and so the \u03c6 decay is kinemat-\nically suppressed. Therefore the condensate decays once \u03c6 \u2248 m\u03c6\/h, assuming that \u0393d > H\n15\nwhen this occurs. The energy density in the field at this time is \u03c1 \u2248 m4\u03c6\/h2. Therefore the\ndecay temperature, which is equivalent to the reheating temperature TR, is\nTd \u2248 m\u03c6\n(h2kd)\n1\/4\n. (54)\nWith g(TD) \u2248 200 we find kd \u2248 65. Therefore\nTd \u2248 1.1\n( m\u03c6\n1 TeV\n)(0.1\nh\n)1\/2\nTeV , (55)\nwhere the particles with the smallest coupling h to \u03c6 will dominate the decay process, so\nlong as \u0393d > H . Therefore Td \u2248 1 \u2212 100 TeV in this model, assuming that the smallest\ncoupling satisfies 0.1 >\u223c h\n>\n\u223c 10\n\u22125. Once h\u03c6 < m\u03c6 the \u03c6 decay rate may be estimated to be\n\u0393d \u2248 h2m\u03c6\/4\u03c0, so the condition \u0393d > H \u2248 5T 2d\/M is easily satisfied for Td in this range.\nWe have assumed that the kinematic suppression of the decay rate prevents \u03c6 decaying\nuntil m\u03c6\n>\n\u223c h\u03c6, in which case Td\n<\n\u223c 100 TeV. We should check that \u03c6 decay through heavy\nintermediate particles cannot cause it to decay significantly earlier. The decay rate via heavy\nintermediate particles of mass h\u03c6 will have the generic form\n\u0393d \u2248\n\u03b1dm\n1+r\n\u03c6\n(h\u03c6)r\n, (56)\nwhere \u03b1d < 1 is a product of couplings and phase space factors. Since there are two heavy\nintermediate states, r \u2265 4 is expected. For r = 4, and using equation (53), (56) and\n\u0393d \u2248 H(Td) \u2248 5T 2d\/M , this gives for the decay temperature\nTd \u2248\n(\n\u03b1d\ng4k2dkT\n)1\/10 (\nm9\u03c6M\n)1\/10 \u2248 35( \u03b1d\ng4k2dkT\n)1\/10 ( m\u03c6\n1 TeV\n)9\/10\nTeV . (57)\nThus for typical couplings, the decay through intermediate states will also result in a re-\nheating temperature in the range TR \u2248 1 \u2212 100 TeV. It is significant that the reheat-\ning temperature, TR\n<\n\u223c 100 TeV, is naturally compatible with the thermal gravitino upper\nbound, TR\n<\n\u223c 10\n6 GeV, without any tuning of couplings. Even though the inflaton is part of\nthe MSSM sector, it still leads to the required low reheating temperature. Since sphaleron\nB +L violation will erase the baryon asymmetry produced by the flat direction inflaton de-\ncay, baryogenesis must occur via some other mechanism, such as Affleck-Dine baryogenesis\nalong an orthogonal flat direction.\n16\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that it is possible for an MSSM extra-flat direction (one suppressed by an\neffective mass scale much larger than the Planck mass) of the form QQQL or ucucdcec to play\nthe role of the inflaton in a D-term inflation model. This eliminates the otherwise unmo-\ntivated singlet inflaton, reducing the number of required additional fields and so providing\na minimal version of D-term inflation. The model has all the advantages of conventional\nD-term inflation with respect to compatibility with SUGRA and absence of fine-tuned cou-\nplings. The nature of reheating depends on whether the extra-flat direction is unstable with\nrespect to Q-ball formation. In the case where Q-balls form, it is possible to generate the\nbaryon asymmetry via Q-ball decay so long as the mass scale suppressing the flat direction\nis sufficiently large, \u039b >\u223c 10\n31\u22121035 GeV, depending on the random phase \u03b8 of the flat direc-\ntion scalar during inflation. With \u039b \u2248 1031 GeV and \u03b8 \u2248 10\u22124 it is possible to generate an\nobservably large baryon isocurvature perturbation. The reheating temperature from Q-ball\ndecay is typically in the range 3 \u2212 100 GeV. As this can be less than the neutralino LSP\nfreeze-out temperature, it is also possible to produce non-thermal dark matter from Q-ball\ndecay. In the case where the flat direction has a large t squark component, there is no Q-\nball formation. In this case the reheating temperature from decay of the homogeneous flat\ndirection condensate is in the range 1\u2212 100 TeV, ensuring sphaleron erasure of the baryon\nasymmetry from the B\u2212L conserving directions while remaining naturally compatible with\nthe thermal gravitino upper bound on TR. The fact that we are able to calculate the re-\nheating temperature in this case is a direct consequence of the inflation being part of the\nMSSM sector. Since the baryon asymmetry from the flat direction is erased, the mass scale\nsuppressing the flat direction in this case is constrained only by proton decay, \u039b >\u223c 10\n26 GeV.\nWe have interpreted the WMAP observation of the spectral index as being due to an order\n10% CMB contribution from cosmic strings combined with a nearly scale-invariant adiabatic\ncurvature perturbation, ns \u2248 1. As in conventional D-term inflation, we can simultaneously\nsuppress the contribution of the cosmic strings to the required level while increasing ns by\nconsidering a small enough coupling of the inflaton to the Fayet-Iliopoulos charged fields.\nThe extra-flat direction D-term inflation model has an advantage over conventional D-term\ninflation in that the range of coupling which leads to an order 10% contribution from cosmic\nstrings is much wider, making it perhaps more natural. For this solution to work, it is also\n17\nnecessary to have a U(1) gauge coupling that is somewhat smaller than the known gauge\ncouplings, g \u2248 0.01 \u2212 0.03. A significant feature of the model is that the superpotential\ncoupling of the monomial QQQL or ucucdcec to \u03a6+\u03a6\u2212 must be much larger than the pure\nmonomial superpotential coupling. This feature may serve to test the compatibility of the\nmodel with an ultra-violet complete theory, as we would naively expect all the superpotential\ncouplings of the monomial to be strongly suppressed. Finally, we note that other solutions to\nthe cosmic string and spectral index problems are possible, for example SUGRA corrections\nfrom a non-minimal Ka\u00a8hler potential [35] and\/or modification of the inflaton potential by\nother fields, such as a RH sneutrino [36].\nThe existence of extra-flat directions of the MSSM is one way to interpret the empirical\nsuppression of non-renormalisable MSSM superpotential terms demanded by proton stabil-\nity. It will be important to establish whether extra-flat directions can be understood in\nthe context of an ultra-violet complete theory and to explore more generally their role and\npossible signatures in cosmology.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of O.S. is supported by the MEC project FPA 2004-02015 and the Comunidad\nde Madrid project HEPHACOS (No. P-ESP-00346).
