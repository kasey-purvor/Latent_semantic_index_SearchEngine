How, at least, can we reduce its \nprevalence? Perhaps, more realistically, how can we ensure that all such violence is \nprohibited by robust substantive laws and how can we make certain that all complaints \nare taken seriously, effectively investigated, prosecuted and, where relevant, convictions \nsecured? One possibility offered by Catharine MacKinnon is to harness international \nhuman rights norms and apply them to violence against women with greater rigour and \ncommitment than has hitherto been the case. This is the focus of MacKinnon\u2019s \ncompelling, and rhetorically powerful, book Are Women Human? And other international \ndialogues (MacKinnon, 2006). One specific focus of her critique is the international \nprohibition on torture. In particular, she asks: \u201cwhy is torture on the basis of sex \u2013 for \nexample, in the form of rape, battering, and pornography \u2013 not seen as a violation of \nhuman rights?\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 17)1 Her answer is deceptively simple. What \nfundamentally distinguishes torture, she argues, from domestic violence, rape and abuse, \nis that \u201ctorture is done to men as well as to women (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 21).\u201d \n                                                 \n1\n  MacKinnon\u2019s essay, \u2018On Torture\u2019, was originally published as \u2018On Torture: A Feminist \nPerspective on Human Rights\u2019, in Mahoney et al (1993).  \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \n \nMacKinnon, therefore, urges us to reconceive many of the abuses which women face as \ntorture. This would draw on the \u201crecognized profile\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 17) of torture \ninternationally, garnering national and international recognition of the egregious nature of \nall violence against women. Further, applying the sobriquet torture, the argument goes, \nwould tap into effective legal sanctions and penalties that are accepted internationally, \nenforced nationally and which may, therefore, may begin to act as a deterrent. The harms \nwhich MacKinnon seeks to reconceptualise as torture are many, including domestic \nviolence, trafficking, pornography and rape. It is the latter which is the particular focus of \nthis article. Specifically, I consider whether beyond the rhetorical, there is value in \nrelabeling and reconceiving all rapes as torture. \n \nRAPE AS \u2018TORTURE\u2019? \n \nCatharine MacKinnon makes a powerful argument that rape is torture and should, legally, \nbe conceived of as such (MacKinnon, 2006). MacKinnon begins by noting that the \n\u201cgenerally recognized\u201d purpose of torture is to \u201ccontrol, intimidate or eliminate\u201d those \nwho challenge a regime and thus is seen as \u201cpolitical\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 18). She \nthen goes on to contrast this with three stories of horrific domestic violence, including \nrepeated rapes. MacKinnon then makes her point:  \n \n\u201cIn all these accounts, all the same things happen that happen in Amnesty International reports \nand accounts of torture \u2013 except they happen in homes in Nebraska or in pornography studios in \nLos Angeles rather than prison cells in Chile or detention centres in Turkey\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, \np. 21). \n \nThe key difference, however, as MacKinnon goes on to note, is that the legal responses to \nthese various situations differ, with the \u2018political\u2019 violence being labeled torture. She \ncontinues that what is at work is a \u201cdouble standard\u201d: what fundamentally distinguishes \ntorture, she argues, from the events of the women describes is that \u201ctorture is done to men \nas well as to women\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 21). She argues that when the abuse is sexual \nor intimate, especially when it is sexual and inflicted by an intimate, it is \u201cgendered\u201d and \nnot considered a human rights violation. This differs from torture which is regarded as \n\u201cpolitically motivated; states are generally required to be involved in it\u201d (MacKinnon, \n2006, p. 21). What needs asking, MacKinnon says: \u201cis why the torture of women by men \nis not seen as torture, specifically why it is not seen as political, and just what the \ninvolvement of the state in it is\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 21).  \n \nIn asking this question, MacKinnon challenges three aspects common to definitions of \ntorture in international human rights instruments.2 The first relates to the required level of \n                                                 \n2\n  There is no uniform definition of torture internationally. MacKinnon\u2019s focus is on international \nhuman rights norms, which determine state responsibility, paradigmatically the UN Convention Against \nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted 10 December 1984, GA \nRes 39\/64, which defines torture as follows:  Article 1: \u2018For the purposes of this Convention, the term \n\u201ctorture\u201d means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally \ninflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, \npunishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \nviolence or harm for conduct such as rape to come within the scope of torture: defined as \n\u2018severe pain and suffering\u2019 in the UN Convention Against Torture.3 Here MacKinnon \ndoes an excellent job of highlighting the serious harm of domestic abuse and rape. \nHaving set out the kinds of practices that are generally accorded the sobriquet \u2018torture\u2019, \nshe then contrasts this with examples of systemic violence, abuse and rape of women at \nthe hands of their partners, such domestic abuse equally involving the imprisonment, \nviolence and degradation that constitutes torture. The parallels are strong. MacKinnon \nclearly draws attention to conduct which might hitherto have been considered \u2018private\u2019 or \n\u2018just\u2019 rape and has not been recognised as the serious harm that it is. She also notes the \nfact that \u201c[w]hen women break under torture, we are said to have consented, or the \ntorturer could have thought we did\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 24). \u201cFew say \u2026. Everybody \nbreaks under torture\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 24). Rape and domestic violence are, \ntherefore, sufficiently serious harms to pass the torture threshold. \n \nMacKinnon then goes on to challenge the notion that torture is political, but women \nabuse is not. She refers here to the law\u2019s general assumptions about who are torturers \n(errant state officials), where it takes place (state detention) and the reasons for it (part of \na political struggle). This is the general picture of the male prisoner of conscience. \nMacKinnon counters such perceptions stating that the systemic abuse and violence, \nincluding rape, which women suffer, is political. It is \u2018neither random nor individual\u2019 and \nthe \u201cfact that you know your assailant does not mean that your membership in a group \nchosen for violation is irrelevant to your abuse\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 22). This abuse, \nshe states, is \u201cstill systemic and group-based\u201d and \u201cdefined by the distribution of power \nin society\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 22). However, it is the suffering of men has the \n\u201cdignity of politics and is called torture\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 22).  \n \nAnd this is where the role of the state comes in. State participation or acquiescence is \ngenerally the sine qua non of international legal definitions of torture.4 The rape of one \nprivate individual by another does not immediately come within this concept of state \nparticipation. MacKinnon responds that, on the contrary, the state is \u201ctypically deeply and \nactively complicit in the abuses under discussion, collaborating in and condoning them\u201d \n(MacKinnon, 2006, p. 23). To confirm this, she gives examples relating to gendered \nviolence generally, such as the police not being interested in domestic crimes, of the \nprevalence and protection through free speech of pornography, of the lack of defences for \nabused women who kill their abusive partners. In specific relation to rape, she argues that \nthe defence of mistaken belief in consent in rape is a \u201cstate atrocity\u201d and offers this as an \nexample of rape law being written for men giving them, in effect, impunity for most \nrapes (MacKinnon, 2006, pp. 24-25). All these laws are \u201caffirmative state acts or positive \nomissions\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 27). The abuse she describes is \u201cnot official in the \n                                                                                                                                                 \nintimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when \nsuch pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public \nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, \ninherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.\u2019 This differs from individual criminal liability under \ninternational criminal law for which the requirement of state participation is not the same. For a detailed \ndiscussion, see Edwards (2006). \n3\n  Ibid. \n4\n  The exception is in international criminal law: see Edwards (2006). \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \nnarrow sense at the time it happened, but its cover-up, legitimization, and legalization \nafter the fact are openly so\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25). In other words: \u201cThe abuse is \nsystematic and known, the disregard is official and organized, and the effective \ngovernmental tolerance is a matter of law and policy (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25).\u201d Thus, \nMacKinnon argues, while the individual perpetrator may not be a state official, there is \nno denying the state\u2019s complicity. MacKinnon\u2019s argument, therefore, is that rape should \ncome within definitions of torture: it is of sufficient harm, is political and the state is \nresponsible.  \n \nInstead, however, what we have is the co-existence of international guarantees of sexual \nequality with \u201cmassive rates of rape and battering and traffic in women through \npornography\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25). MacKinnon recognises that there have been \nsome changes. Rape has been found to constitute torture when it happens in official state \ncustody.5 Thus, a woman\u2019s human rights are more likely to be \u201cdeemed violated when the \nstate can be seen as an instrumentality of the rape\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25). Yet, she \ngoes on, \u201cthe regular laws and their regular everyday administration are not seen as \nofficial state involvement in legalized sex inequality\u201d (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25), but they \nshould be. MacKinnon concludes: \u201cIf, when women are tortured because we are women, \nthe law recognized that a human being had her human rights violated, the term \u2018rights\u2019 \nwould begin to have something of the content to which we might aspire (MacKinnon, \n2006, p. 27).\u201d  \n \nQUESTIONS OF FEMINIST STRATEGY: RAPE AS RAPE? \n \nCatharine MacKinnon makes a powerful argument that rape is torture and should, legally, \nbe conceived of as such. Similar arguments have been made regarding domestic violence \nby Rhonda Copelon who has also highlighted the parallels between both forms of \nviolence, the purpose of the violence and the role of the state (Copelon, 1994b). Copelon \nwrites that her primary goal is to \u2018challenge the assumption that intimate violence is a \nless severe and terrible form of violence than that perpetrated by the state\u2019 (Copelon, \n1994b, pp. 139-140). MacKinnon too demands that the world open its eyes to the gravity \nand endemic nature of sexual violence against women, including rape, and the complicity \nof states in its continuation.   \n  \nUltimately, both MacKinnon and Copelon are making a strategic argument. They seek to \ntap into the symbolism of the term \u2018torture\u2019 and the stringent legal demands and \nrequirements that come with it (Edwards, 2006). And they are right that, in practice, the \ngrant of the status of torture to rape or domestic violence would bring with it more \ndemanding legal requirements at the international level and greater condemnation of acts \nnationally. But this underlines that the argument is rhetorical: the broader aim is to ensure \nrecognition of these harms against women. This is a powerful rhetorical strategy. It \ndemands that we consider the extent of state complicity in gender-based violence. It is \nalso a strategy with a history. Edward Peters notes that in the late nineteenth century, as \nthe word torture was being used to describe ever more acts, a pamphlet written by \nFrances Power Cobbe about domestic violence was entitled Wife Torture (Peters, 1996, \n                                                 \n5\n  Aydin v Turkey \u2013 see further  \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \npp. 151-152). He rightly notes that the use of the term torture was \u201carresting and \nunambiguous\u201d and notes that the title was \u201castutely chosen and created a perspective \nupon the problem that must have focused a great deal of hitherto diffused attention\u201d upon \nthe subject matter (Peters, 1996, pp. 151-152). The term torture, Peters argues, was being \nused in an \u201chonourable and just cause\u201d.6 MacKinnon\u2019s conceptualization of all rapes as \ntorture and of the state being \u2018complicit\u2019 in all rapes is rhetorically powerful, also in \npursuit of an \u2018honourable and just cause\u2019. But there are potential disadvantages in seeking \nthe adoption of torture as a synonym for rape. \n \nRape as a gendered crime \n \nDomestic abuse and rape are gender-based crimes. They are predominantly carried out \nagainst women and continue due to the unequal status of women in society. To term these \nharms and crimes \u2018torture\u2019 may actually obscure this reality. The term rape, on the other \nhand, is widely accepted as describing a harm against women by men. While it does, and \nshould, encompass the rape of men, it must also not be forgotten that this is primarily a \ncrime by men against women.7 Thus, while the word \u2018torture\u2019 has huge symbolic value, \nso does \u2018rape\u2019. To classify an act as rape raises it in society\u2019s mind to an act which is \nespecially grave and serious. It is sometimes argued that it is just this symbolic nature of \nthe term which may be a factor in the high number of acquittals at court: the jury, so the \nargument goes, may perceive the acts of the defendant as wrong, as even criminal, but \nthey may not wish to label him a \u2018rapist\u2019. It is also why, when debating law reform of \nsexual offences, many reject the removal of the term rape and its replacement with, say, \n\u2018sexual assault\u2019 (Temkin, 2002, pp. 177-178). In other words, rape is rape. It may \nsometimes constitute torture, but not always, which takes us to the next issue. \n \nAre all rapes equally heinous? \n \nThere is another possible reason why naming all rapes as torture may not be the most \nappropriate feminist strategy. We should recognise that while all rapes are serious crimes, \nthe circumstances and context of some rapes may make them even worse than others. As \nChristine Chinkin has said, \u2018rape and sexual violence occurs along a continuum of \nseriousness\u2019 (Chinkin, 1994, p. 339).8 In saying that some rapes are more serious and \nheinous than others simply reflects common understandings of the different degrees of \ncrimes committed, for example resulting in differential sentencing. This does demand a \nmore nuanced approach to degrees of gravity, than has hitherto been the case in relation \nto rape. It does not mean that stranger rape is worse than acquaintance rape, that rape \nwith physical violence is worse than rape with psychological violence. But I am arguing \nthat, on a continuum, the systemic, life-threatening and mass nature of the rapes \ncommitted in conflicts such as Rwanda or the former Yugoslavia should be recognised as \n                                                 \n6\n  Though Peters rejects using the torture to describe domestic violence, he does accept that it is a \npowerful rhetorical tool (Peters, 1996, pp. 151-152).  \n7\n  It is less obvious that the term \u2018domestic violence\u2019 is gender specific, but it generally remains \nunderstood as such. \n8\n  This is also the important insight of Liz Kelly in highlighting the seriousness of all acts of sexual \nviolence, including so-called \u2018flashing\u2019: Kelly (1988). \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \namong the most heinous crimes and among the worst atrocities to have faced women. \nThis is why, of course, these crimes have been found to constitute crimes against \nhumanity, genocide, torture and other war crimes. Indeed, MacKinnon does deploy the \nterm \u201cgenocidal rape\u201d to describe such situations (MacKinnon, 2006, pp. 180-195).9 \n \nUsing such terminology seems to imply that for MacKinnon some rapes are more serious \nthan others.10 And this is my argument in relation to torture: all rapes are injurious, but \nsome rapes which constitute torture or genocide are arguably more extreme and more \ndemanding of international condemnation. Is \u2018genocidal rape\u2019 not indeed worse than \nmany other rapes at the political and legal level? Clearly the individual woman who \nsurvives rape may challenge the idea that what she experienced is not as harmful as other \nrape situations, but genocide is about the destruction of a race, about the killing and death \nof a whole culture and people.11 This is worse, at the societal and political level, than an \ninstance of individual rape which is not genocidal. \n \nThere is a danger that the consequence of this argument is that \u201clesser\u201d rapes \u201cmay still \nbe committed with impunity\u201d (Chinkin, 1994, p. 340) and are treated less seriously. But \nsuch claims must be challenged and rejected. Copelon does argue that the reason why \nrape, and other crimes of sexual violence, should be mainstreamed into international \ncriminal law, such that rape constitutes torture, is that \u201chistory teaches us that there is an \nalmost inevitable tendency for crimes that are seen simply or primarily as crimes against \nwomen to be treated as of secondary importance\u201d (Copelon, 2000-2001, p. 234). This is \ntrue. But there is also the danger that were all domestic violence and rape to be subsumed \nunder the term \u2018torture\u2019, that they would be more easily forgotten and ignored, and less \neasily recognised as gender-based.  \n \nThe mundanity of rape  \n \nWhile each rape is extremely serious and must be treated as such, rape is also mundane in \nits everyday nature, in the ordinariness of the men who commit it. This is a further \nargument for keeping rape as rape. Recent studies have suggested that in the UK alone \nthere are anywhere between 47,000 and 61,000 rapes each year.12 Rape occurs all the \ntime and everywhere. The men who commit rape are not demons, monsters and \npsychopaths, though undoubtedly some are. They are ordinary brothers, fathers, sons, \nfriends, colleagues, teachers, doctors and the like. We should keep the term torture for \nwhat is generally understood as torture \u2013 extreme acts in exceptional circumstances. This \nis not to suggest that torturers are not ordinary men (and women) because they are. Nor is \nit to suggest that torture is as rare as we would like to think or are led to believe it is. But \n                                                 \n9\n  The use of the term \u2018genocidal rape\u2019 is contested among feminists. For a discussion, see further: \nEngel (2005). \n10\n  Though she does later state that \u201cwhat rape does in genocide is what it does the rest of the time: \nruins identity, marks who you are as less, as damaged (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 230)\u201d. \n11\n  See, for example, the challenge to such an argument from the organisation Women in Black \nwriting regarding genocide in Bosnia: \u201cA victim is a victim, and to her the number of other victims does \nnot decrease her own suffering and pain (quoted in Engle, 2005, p. 788)\u201d. \n12\n  Myhill and Allen (2002) extrapolated from their study an annual incidence for rape of 61,000 \nrapes. Walby and Allen (2004) estimated an annual incidence of 47,000. \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \nit is to argue that torture is comparatively rare. Rape is not rare. Rape is commonplace. \nWe need to establish this understanding in our society, and to label it as torture may in \nfact reinforce assumptions about what constitutes a \u2018real\u2019 rape, about the types of men \nwho carry out rape and about penalties for rape.13 \n \nA \u2018fate worse than death\u2019? \n \nFinally, while for many rape survivors, the rape has ruined their lives, threatened their \nlivelihood through wrecking their well-being and destroyed the security and comfort that \nthey took for granted in their lives; for others, it is serious, harmful, painful, but they \nmove on. Over-generalising the trauma of rape may add to the perception of rape as \nexceptional, as especially dreadful and to be feared: to be a \u2018fate worse than death\u2019. \nWhile this may be the perception of some women, many others do survive and move \non.14 For example, Germaine Greer, in advocating the use of the term \u2018sexual assault\u2019 \ninstead of \u2018rape\u2019, argues that doing so may ensure that \u2018attacks on children would be seen \nas far worse than penetration of a grown woman\u2019 (Greer, 2007). She seeks to de-\nemphasise the significance of rape in the canon of harms against women. Similarly, \nKaren Engle suggests that in finding that rape per se constitutes the harm required for \ntorture, reinforces the \u2018understanding that women are not capable of not being victimized \nby the rapes\u2019 (Engle, 2005, p. 813). Again, my point is not to downplay the significance \nof rape. But is it to suggest that relabeling rape as torture would ratchet up the perception \nof harm to a level which may be unhelpful for some women in overcoming rape and may \ndistract us from focusing on the variety of ways in which women are discriminated \nagainst in society. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nCatharine MacKinnon powerfully demonstrates the international community\u2019s disinterest \nin violence against women. She challenges us to ask why this is so, pointing to the \ngendered nature of crimes against women and the factual similarities between such \ncrimes and traditional ideas of torture. She makes us face up to the disingenuous nature of \nso many international statements, call them platitudes, condemning gender based \nviolence. But beyond the rhetorical, what would her argument about rape and torture \nmean in practice? To see the state as complicit in all rapes means either naming the state \nas the actual perpetrator, which MacKinnon does reject (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25), but \nshe goes on nonetheless to argue that the legitimisation, legalisation and lack of effective \nremedies for rape are state acts or omissions (MacKinnon, 2006, p. 25). If this was to be \ntranslated into legal accountability for torture, it would have to mean that the state has \nacquiesced to all rapes and is accordingly legally responsible.15  \n \n                                                 \n13\n  There is an argument that juries find it difficult to convict defendants for rape due to the \nseriousness of the label \u2018rapist\u2019. Arguably, this would be even more so were the label \u2018torturer\u2019 to then be \napplied. \n14\n  Copelon (1994b) makes this argument in respect of survivors of domestic violence, though she \nstill argues that domestic violence should be recognised as torture. \n15\n  See the definition of torture, above in Article 1 of the UN Convention Against Torture. \nPublished in (2008) 16 (1) Feminist Legal Studies 71-85 \n \n[Type text] \n \nBut, to say that the state acquiesces to all rapes is to place too much focus on the role of \nstates in determining the prevalence and continuation of rape. Rape is a broad cultural \nphenomenon that does not just exist because of state action or inaction. It is maintained \nby education, media, politics, economics, culture and a wide array of other facets of \nsociety. Law and the state play a significant role but cannot alone be responsible. \nMacKinnon\u2019s analysis suggests we demand more of states and indeed we could and \nshould. Few governments do enough to prohibit rape, to punish it and to try to prevent it. \nBut whether this means that there is state complicity in every rape, in the legal sense of \nstate complicity to torture, is not so clear. State complicity, as a trope for our \nunderstandings of rape, is valid and arresting and makes us think again about the role of \nthe state and what could be done. But state complicity cannot extend to meaning that \nevery rape is torture in the sense that it is committed by the state or that the state is \ncomplicit and therefore legally responsible. To hold otherwise would be to say that all \nmen are acting on behalf of the state when raping. \n \nThe existence and prevalence of rape is political, any solutions need to be political. But \nthis does not mean that every act of rape is political in the same sense of an individual \nbeing raped to secure a confession, or to provide information, or as part of a programme \nof ethnic cleansing. The latter political purposes are direct and result in the direct \ninfliction of the harm on rape on the individual. The political realities of gendered \nviolence which MacKinnon discusses are less direct and cannot in reality be attributed to \nevery perpetrator of every rape. Rape does happen because of gender inequalities and the \npolitical process is the means by which to try to change this; but the holding that each and \nevery rape is torture will not bring us nearer to achieving this purpose. MacKinnon\u2019s \nanalysis is valuable in reminding us that rape, generally, is political, but perhaps we need \nto recognise that not every rape is individually political.   \n \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n \nI should like to thank Neil Cobb, Erika Rackley, Celia Wells and Nicole Westmarland for \ntheir time and energy in discussing with me the ideas expressed in this article.
