This observation is consistent with the presence \nof functional lipid rafts in these ancient, highly polarised organisms. \n \n \n1. Introduction \n 2\nThe plasma membrane of eukaryotes is typically partitioned into functional \ndomains. In addition, specialised micro-domains exist which harbour small \nsubsets of proteins. In higher eukaryotic systems, several plasma membrane \nproteins, particularly those anchored by a  glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) \nmoiety, are associated with sphingolipid\/cholesterol-rich micro-domains termed \nrafts [reviewed 1,2]. These domains are thought to be analogous to detergent \nresistant membranes (DRMs) [3] and possibly also to plasma membrane \nstructures termed caveolae [1]. Rafts, which form within the Golgi complex, have \nbeen implicated in polarised trafficking in epithelial cells, specifically to the apical \nplasma membrane, and also in the assembly of supramolecular complexes \ninvolved in signal transduction [1,2]. A recent comprehensive study in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated the presence of similar lipid micro-\ndomains in yeasts [4]. Interestingly, unlike in mammalian cells, rafts in yeast are \nfirst detected in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the suggestion that \nthey are involved in the biosynthetic delivery of protein to the cell surface. \nProtozoan parasites of the phylum Kinetoplastida cause a spectrum of \ntropical and sub-tropical diseases. Much research has focused on the unusually \nhigh levels of GPI-anchored molecules present on the surfaces of these \norganisms [5].  These are essential for survival of mammalian bloodstream-form \nTrypanosoma brucei [6].  The most intensively studied GPI-anchored molecules \nare the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) of bloodstream-form T. brucei [7] and \nin Leishmania, the metalloprotease GP63 (or leishmanolysin) [8] and the \nglycoconjugates, lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and the glycoinositol phospholipids \n(GIPLs) [9].  All of these molecules have been implicated in virulence: VSG in \nevasion of both the cellular and humoral host immune response [7]; LPG and \nGP63 in resistance of insect stage (promastigote) Leishmania to hydrolytic \nenzymes in the vector gut and to mammalian complement [10]; LPG in invasion \nof and survival within macrophages [11]; GIPLs for viability of both the insect and \nmammalian (amastigote) stages of the life cycle [12].  These molecules are \nsuggested to form a dense, homogenous and protective coat at the parasite cell \nsurface [13]. Given the predisposition of these organisms to traffic large amounts \n 3\nof GPI-anchored molecules through the specialised flagellar pocket to the cell \nsurface [14,15], it is of interest to investigate whether lipid rafts exist in these cells \nand to determine the role they play in secretion and lipid\/protein transport.  The \npresence, or otherwise, of kinetoplastid rafts may also influence our view of the \nsurface architecture of these protozoans; for example, whether micro-domains \ninvolved in signal transduction are present at the plasma membrane. Additional \ncell surface components of Leishmania are the unusual hydrophilic acylated \nsurface proteins (HASPs) [16]. These polypeptides are anchored to the plasma \nmembrane via a myristoylated\/palmitoylated N-terminus [17]; similarly modified \nproteins are found associated with the cytoplasmic leaflet of lipid rafts in \nmammalian cells [18]. The presence, or otherwise, of the HASPs in lipid rafts \nmay help elucidate their route to the cell surface and their cryptic function. \nRecent work has suggested that lipid micro-domains may form in T. brucei \n[19]. In this study, we show that DRMs are present in both Leishmania and T. \nbrucei, suggesting that they occur throughout the Kinetoplastida. We define lipid \nrafts in L. major as being enriched in sphingolipid (inositol phosphosphingolipid) \nand sterol (probably ergosterol, as in yeast), in addition to GPI-anchored \nglycoconjugate (LPG) and glycoprotein (GP63). Surprisingly, the dual acylated \nHASPB appears to be largely excluded from these domains, and the members of \nthe GIPL family are differentially sequestered.  \n \n2. Materials and Methods \n2.1 Cell culture and radio-labelling. L. major promastigotes \n(MHOM\/IL\/81\/Friedlin) were maintained as previously described [17]. For protein \nanalyses, cells were pretreated for 30 min in Dulbecco\u2019s MEM (DMEM) (ICN) \nlacking methionine and cysteine, then metabolically labelled for 90 min in the \nsame medium containing 50 \u00b5Ci\/ml of TRAN[35S]-label\u2122 (>1000 Ci\/mmol) (ICN). \nFor LPG analyses, cells were pretreated for 30 min in glucose-free (DMEM) \n(Gibco BRL) containing 0.8 \u03bcg\/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) and 1% bovine serum \nalbumin (Sigma), then metabolically labelled for 3 hours in the same medium \ncontaining 400 \u00b5Ci\/ml of D-[2-3H] mannose (21 Ci\/mmol) (NEN). For lipid \n 4\nanalyses, cells were labelled for 24 hours in DMEM (ICN) supplemented with \n10% foetal calf serum (Gibco BRL) and 10-20 \u00b5Ci\/ml of myo-[3H] inositol (102 \nCi\/mmol) (Amersham) or 10 \u00b5Ci\/ml R-[2-14C] mevalonic acid lactone (48.0 \nmCi\/mmol) (Amersham). For pulse-chase analysis, 108 Leishmania \npromastigotes were starved for 45 min at 26\u02daC in 1 ml DMEM lacking methionine \nand cysteine. Cells were then labelled in 0.5 ml of the same medium with 100 \n\u00b5Ci\/ml of TRAN[35S]-label\u2122 for 5 min, diluted in 10ml of DMEM containing 10% \nfoetal calf serum and chased for 40 min. Culture adapted 427 trypomastigote \nTrypanosoma brucei brucei were grown in HMI9 medium, with 10% foetal calf \nserum at 37\u02daC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and maintained at a culture density of \n<1 x 107ml. \n2.2  Detergent extraction.  Leishmania cell pellets (5x107) were washed with \nPBS and extracted with 1ml 1% TX-100 in PBS plus protease inhibitors \n(Complete\u2122 Mini (Roche) and 1\u00b5g\/ml pepstatin (Sigma)) for 10 min at 37\u00baC or on \nice. Detergent soluble and insoluble molecules were separated by centrifugation \nfor 2 min at 14000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5402 centrifuge at room temperature or \n4\u00baC. 1 x 107 T. brucei trypomastigotes, expressing VSG 221, were extracted with \n50\u00b5l 0.35% TX-100 in PBS, supplemented with 20mM ZnCl2 to inhibit \nendogenous GPI-PLC [20], at 4\u02daC or room temperature. \n2.3  Protein extraction and analyses.  Leishmania cell pellets were lysed in \n50\u00b5l 1% SDS PBS, adjusted to 1ml with 1% TX-100 PBS and supplemented with \n5mM each of CaCl2 and MnCl2. The TX-100 extract was supplemented similarly \nand both fractions incubated with 10\u00b5l agarose-bound concanavalin A (Sigma) \nfor 1 hour at room temperature, to precipitate glycosylated proteins (primarily \nGP63). The subsequent fractions were heated in loading buffer and separated by \nSDS-PAGE. \n2.4  Lipid extraction and analyses.  Leishmania glycolipids were extracted in \nchloroform\/methanol\/water (1:2:0:8, v\/v) and analysed on Silica Gel 60 \naluminium-backed HPTLC plates (Merck) developed in chloroform\/methanol\/1M \nammonium acetate\/13M NH4OH\/water (180:140:9:9:23, v\/v) as previously \ndescribed [21]. For sterol analysis, total lipids were extracted in \n 5\nchloroform\/methanol (2:1, v\/v) overnight at room temperature, phase separated \nand the lower organic phase dried in a Speed Vac\u00ae (Savant). Samples were \ndeveloped in chloroform\/methanol\/water (65:35:8, v\/v) on Kieselgel 60 TLC \nplates (Merck) [4] and exposed directly to Kodak Biomax MS film. Cholesterol \n(Sigma) was used as a marker. \n2.5  LPG extraction and analysis.  After glycolipid extraction as above from [3H] \nmannose-labelled cells, the remaining pelleted material (proteins and LPG) was \nheated in loading buffer and separated by SDS PAGE. \n2.6  Isolation of detergent resistant membranes.  1-2x108 Leishmania cells \nresuspended in 500 \u00b5l PBS (plus protease inhibitors) were disrupted with 500 \u00b5m \nglass beads (Sigma). The resultant lysate was adjusted to 1% TX-100 PBS (plus \nprotease inhibitors) and extracted for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. Samples were loaded at the \nbottom of Optiprep\u00ae step gradients as previously described [4]. After \ncentrifugation at 50,000rpm for 3 hours and 25,000rpm for 15 hours in a SW60 \nrotor, 6 fractions were taken from the top of the gradient. Fractions were either \nsubject to lipid\/LPG analysis as above or precipitated with trichloroacetic acid [4] \nfor protein analyses. \n2.7  Electrophoresis and Western blotting.  Cell or fractionation pellets were \nresuspended in running buffer, boiled and separated by SDS PAGE. Proteins \nwere either silver stained (Biorad) or electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon \nP membranes (Millipore). Metabolically labelled proteins and LPG were detected \nusing the Kodak BioMax TranScreen intensifying screen system. GP63 was \ndetected using a polyclonal antibody (provided by Rob McMaster, University of \nBritish Columbia). HASPB was detected using a polyclonal antibody [16]. VSG \n221 was isolated by hypertonic lysis of trypomastigotes in 20mM Tris-HCl, \npurified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex [20] and used to \nraise rabbit-antiserum. \n \n \n3. Results \n 6\n3.1 Temperature-dependent detergent extraction of the major Leishmania \nsurface macromolecules. \nOne of the defining properties of DRMs\/lipid rafts is their differential behaviour \nwhen extracted with 1% TX-100 at varying temperatures. Specifically, raft lipids \nand proteins are resistant to extraction at 4\u00baC, but are effectively solublised at a \nhigher temperature [3]. The predominant macromolecules on the surface of \nLeishmania promastigotes, LPG and GP63, are both GPI-anchored. Fig. 1 shows \nthe results of extraction of Leishmania cells with 1% TX-100 PBS at 4\u00baC and \n37\u00baC.  Both GP63 (Fig. 1a) and LPG (Fig. 1b) are clearly non-extractable at 4\u00baC, \nbut are completely solublised at 37\u00baC. These data provide preliminary evidence \nthat the major parasite GPI-anchored macro-molecules are segregated into \ndetergent resistant membranes, which may be analogous to lipid rafts. \n3.2 Temperature-dependent detergent extraction of Leishmania lipids. \nIn mammalian cells and yeast, specific lipids (sphingolipids and sterols) as well \nas GPI-anchored proteins display differential detergent extractability. In \nLeishmania the behaviour of various classes of lipid was examined under the \nsame specific extraction conditions. As previously described [22], the \nphosphoglycerides, phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylinositol phosphate \n(PIP), and the sphingolipid, inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), can be identified \nas the major species in L. major after labelling with myo-[3H] inositol and \nseparation by HPTLC. Fig. 2a clearly demonstrates that whilst IPC is resistant to \ncold extraction with 1% TX-100, both PI and PIP are solubilised. Again, raising \nthe temperature leads to complete extraction of the labelled species. Similarly, de \nnovo synthesised sterols (ergosterol rather than cholesterol in Leishmania \npromastigotes [23]) labelled with R-[2-14C] mevalonic acid lactone are non-\nextractable with cold TX-100 (Fig. 2c). Thus, by performing a simple detergent \nextraction, there is an enrichment of components (GPI-anchored molecules, \nsphingolipids and sterols) that are characteristic of eukaryotic lipid rafts. It should \nalso be noted that the minor inositol-containing species, the GIPLs [22,24], are \ndifferentially extracted at 4\u00baC (Fig. 2b). Those species labelled A, B and C are \nalmost completely solublised; D, E and F are at least partially non-extractable; G \n 7\nis also soluble. HPTLC separation shows A, B and C to be the least polar \nlabelled GIPLs. By analysis of Rf values and direct comparison of the distinctive \nprofiles with available data [22,24], these probably represent iso-forms of GIPL-1 \nand GIPL-2. The most polar labelled GIPL (G) is probably P-GIPL-2 or P-GIPL-3; \nthese are the only lyso-alkyl GIPLs [22,24]. Similar comparisons suggest that \nthose GIPLs that demonstrate a degree of insolubility (D, E and F) are probably \niso-forms of GIPL-3 and possibly GIPL-2 [22,24]. The implication of these results \nis that the GIPLs inhabit different lipid environments. This could reflect differential \nlocalisation to sub-cellular compartments, either during biosynthesis [21] or at \nsteady state [25], or segregation into distinct lipid domains at the plasma \nmembrane. \n3.3 Temperature-dependent detergent extraction of T. brucei VSG. \nThe presence of lipid micro-domains has been reported in T. brucei [19]. Fig. 3 \nshows that, like Leishmania GP63 and LPG, T. brucei VSG is detergent-\nextracted from cells in a temperature-dependent manner. This suggests that VSG \nlocalises within DRMs, and illustrates that such lipid micro-domains are probably \na widespread feature of the phylum Kinetoplastida. However, this differential \nextractability is only observed when the detergent concentration is reduced from \n1% to 0.35% TX-100, indicating that the lipid composition of T. brucei rafts is \nsomewhat different to that in Leishmania, and indeed mammalian and yeast \ncells. VSG has previously been demonstrated to be detergent-extracted with 1% \nTX-100 at 4\u00baC from synthetic membranes with a mammalian lipid content [26]. \n3.4 Kinetics of GP63 DRM\/lipid raft association. \nIt is known that mammalian lipid rafts form in the Golgi complex [3]. However, \nanalogous S. cerevisiae micro-domains can be detected in the ER [4]. The \nkinetics of GP63 association with DRMs were analysed by pulse chase analysis, \nusing the same cell extraction conditions as previously. From these data, it is \nclear that GP63 becomes detergent- insoluble very rapidly: at time 0 min (after a \n5 min pulse), only a small minority of the protein is detected as soluble. This \nsoluble fraction then begins to disappear over time in a reproducible manner. \nThis suggests that as in yeast, Leishmania rafts form in the ER or another early \n 8\ncompartment of the secretory pathway, and may act as biosynthetic centres \nand\/or in the delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane. \n3.5  Further characterisation by direct isolation of DRMs\/lipid rafts. \nMembrane fractions representing DRMs were first isolated as low density \nmaterial by gradient centrifugation [3]. Using Optiprep\u00ae step gradients, putative \nlipid rafts have been isolated from Leishmania after cold TX-100 treatment. Fig. 5 \nillustrates the gradient, the fractions taken and their analysis. Silver staining of \nproteins following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5b) shows the majority of proteins to be in the \nhigher density fractions towards the bottom of the gradient (fractions 5 and 6). \nHowever, a single, intense band (*) is clear in low density fraction 2. Note that the \nquantity of material in fraction 6 (the bottom of the gradient) is variable and has \npreviously been proposed to contain non-specifically pelleted protein, including \nraft-associated molecules that have failed to be fully released by the cell \ndisruption procedure [3]. By immuno-staining, the silver-stained band in fraction 2 \nis confirmed as GPI-anchored GP63; this protein is only found in this low density \nfraction and with non-specifically pelleted material in fraction 6 (Fig. 5c). Similarly, \nD-[2-3H] mannose-labelled LPG segregates solely with this low density material \n(Fig. 5e). In contrast, the dually acylated HASPB is found largely in fractions 4-6 \n(high density material), with a minor component in fraction 2 (Fig. 5d). Thus, \ncontrary to expectations based on results in mammalian systems [18], \nmyristoylated\/palmitoylated HASPs are, at best, only partially associated with \nlipid rafts in Leishmania. It has been previously demonstrated by fractionation \nthat this surface protein is tightly associated with membranous material [17].  In \nsummary, then, GPI-anchored protein (GP63) and glycoconjugate (LPG) appear \nto be tightly associated with the low density lipid raft fraction, while di-acylated \nHASPB and GPI-anchored GIPLs are at least partly solublised under our \nexperimental conditions.  These observations suggest that the GPI-anchored \nmacromolecules, GIPLs and HASPB exist within separate membrane domains.  \nThe lipid composition of mammalian [3] and S. cerevisiae [4] rafts has \nbeen documented as rich in sphingolipid. By labelling with myo-[3H] inositol, \nfollowed by density gradient separation of  the detergent-treated cell extracts, we \n 9\nexamined the PI and IPC composition of each fraction. Fig. 6 clearly \ndemonstrates that whereas IPC behaves as raft-associated material, being \nenriched in low density fractions, PI is concentrated towards the bottom of the \ngradient indicating that it has been detergent-solubilised. In conclusion, the low \ndensity fractions (1 and 2) isolated on the gradients are enriched in IPC and GPI-\nanchored molecules, whereas PI and the majority of cell proteins are detergent-\nsolublised and therefore found in the high density fractions. These data \ndemonstrate that DRMs can be isolated from Leishmania as low density fractions \nthat share the characteristics of lipid rafts in higher eukaryotes. \n \n4.  Discussion \nIn a simple cold detergent treatment of insect-stage Leishmania and bloodstream \nform T. brucei, the major classes of GPI-anchored molecules (GP63, LPG, some \nGIPLs and VSG) are resistant to extraction. This suggests that DRMs\/lipid rafts \nare a feature of the divergent Kinetoplastida and are therefore likely to be \nconserved in eukaryotic evolution. In Leishmania, de novo synthesised \nsphingolipid (IPC) and sterols behave in a similar detergent-resistant manner, \nwhereas the phosphoglycerides, PI and PIP, and most GIPLs are solubilised, \nindicating that distinct lipid domains exist in these organisms. Further analyses, \nemploying density gradient centrifugation, isolated the detergent-resistant \nmembranes (DRMs) as a low density fraction rich in GPI-anchored \nmacromolecules and sphingolipid. The lipid composition of these DRMs \u2013 \nenriched in IPC and sterol \u2013 mirror those in yeast [4]. Yeast, protozoa and plants \nsynthesise IPC-based sphingolipids, rather than sphingomyelin-based \nsphingolipids as in mammalian cells [27]. Another parallel with yeast is that \nLeishmania rafts form in an early secretory compartment. Whether this is related \nto their compositional similarity or not is unclear, but it may implicate Leishmania \nrafts in protein delivery to the cell surface, as in S. cerevisiae [4]. \nIt is hypothesised that these assemblies of sphingolipids and sterols form \na discrete liquid-ordered phase in the liquid-disordered (or liquid crystalline) \nmembrane due to the presence of long, saturated hydrocarbon chains [1,2]. \n 10\nProteins associating with this ordered environment tend to possess saturated \nacyl chain anchors, being either GPI-anchored or modified with myristate and\/or \npalmitate. As might be predicted, GPI-anchored GP63 and LPG segregate into \nLeishmania DRMs. However, it appears that only some species of GPI-anchored \nGIPLs behave in a similar manner. This could be due to the different head group \ncomposition of the GIPLs or because individual GIPL species have different \nhydrocarbon chain anchors in L. major [22,24]. It is possible that the \nlength\/degree of saturation will affect whether a GIPL enters the liquid-ordered or \nliquid-crystalline phase in the lipid bilayer [26]. DRM-associated GP63 [28] and \nLPG [29,30] are both modified with a very long (C24 or C26) saturated \nalkylglycerol moiety. The relatively short acyl chain length of myristate (C12) and \npalmitate (C14) may prevent HASPB associating stably with Leishmania rafts. \nAlthough lyso-alkyl P-GIPL-2 and 3 have very similar anchors to LPG, they \nappear to be soluble under the same conditions. However, these species \nprobably act as intermediates in LPG biosynthesis [22,24] and therefore may \noccupy a sub-cellular compartment of a specific lipid composition.  \nOur previously published data on HASPB localisation have demonstrated \nthat only a proportion (20-30%) of the protein may be located on the external face \nof the plasma membrane, the rest being on the cytosolic side [17]. It is notable \nthat a similar proportion was detected in the lipid raft fraction (Fig. 5d).  Although \nrafts do form on the inner face of the mammalian plasma membrane, their \ncomposition is unknown [1,2]. It is possible that the DRM-associated HASPB \ndetected is that associated with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. \nWhat are the implications for the presence of lipid rafts on the surface \narchitecture of protozoan parasites? They may form functional micro-domains at \nthe plasma membrane involved in, for example, signal transduction [31] or the \nformation of specific adhesion\/recognition sites. Alternatively, in Leishmania, they \nmay serve as intracellular biosynthetic centres for the manufacture of LPG and \nGIPLs [32]. As described above, the major GPI-anchored surface molecules are \nthought to form a protective barrier in promastigote Leishmania and bloodstream \nform T. brucei [13]. Obviously the concept of lipid micro-domains rich in such \n 11\nmolecules does not fit easily into such a simple model. However, it is possible to \ntake an alternative view in which the plasma membrane of the parasite exists \nlargely in a liquid-ordered phase with liquid-crystalline micro-domains or rafts \n[33]. In this model, sphingolipid\/sterol-rich platforms could serve in the delivery of \nGPI-anchored molecules to the plasma membrane in a \u201cdefault\u201d polarised \nmanner via the flagellar pocket. The early formation of rafts in the secretory \npathway of Leishmania would support a role in transport of GPI-anchored \nmolecules and\/or biosynthetic centre formation, but does not preclude other \nfunctions. The functions of mammalian lipid rafts remain unclear even though \ntheir presence at the plasma membrane is becoming ever less contentious.    \nAs yet, we have no indication of raft distribution in the Kinetoplastida, but it \nshould be noted that eukaryotic cilia and flagella have distinct lipid compositions \n[34]. It would thus be of interest to investigate the distribution of IPC\/ergosterol \nmicro-domains in these flagellated protozoa, particularly given recent \ndemonstrations of differential protein distribution between the cell body and \nflagellum in these organisms [35,36].  \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nWe thank Robert McMaster, for the generous provision of antibodies to GP63, \nand Gareth Morgan and Tim Jeffries for critical reading of this manuscript.
