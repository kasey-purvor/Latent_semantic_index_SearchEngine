A social constructionism \nperspective enables a methodological reflection on how, with what legitimacy, and to \nwhat social good, knowledge is produced.

Our conclusion is \nthat foresight is both a social construction, and a mechanism for social construction.  \nMethodologically, foresight projects should acknowledge the socially constructed \nnature of their process and outcomes as this will lead to greater rigour and legitimacy.  \n \nIntroduction \nIn this article we consider the contribution that social constructionism makes to \nforesight methodologies.  We take the term \u2018methodology\u2019 to mean \u2018methods of \nknowing\u2019, i.e. an explanation of \u2018how we know\u2019 something.  As Andrew Sayer says, a \nmethodology needs to be appropriate to the nature of the object under study and the \npurpose and expectation of the study.  Methodologies are puzzle solving devices and \nrequire us to make assumptions of what the world is and what stands for knowledge.  \n[35, p92].  There are many puzzles about the future that we would wish to solve.  \nHowever, our focus here is on the general features of approaches to understanding and \nmaking sense of futures, i.e. knowledge\u2013creating activities that are associated with the \nterm foresight.  Our focus is not on how the future is produced, but the grounds we \nhave to make claims about knowledge relating to the future. \n \nA common feature of the way that knowledge about futures is created is the centrality \nof symbols.  Meaning, actions, decisions, investments, conflicts and accords rest on \n 2\nthe interpretations of futures projected and communicated through symbols: words, \ntexts, images, objects and symbolic actions.  Symbols such as trend lines, images, \nmodels, equations and of course the ubiquitous scenario are the stock-in-trade of \nforesight activities. Any foresight methodology, i.e. any attempt to validate the design \nof knowledge creation, should reflect the way that meaning emerges as thoughts and \nideas, discourses and texts, anticipations and decisions, about the future.   \n \nThe article is not about the symbols and symbolism per se, these are taken for granted.  \nPrimarily it is about theories of the ways in which meaning is created, understood and \nacted upon.  Its purpose is to help understand and validate processes of doing \nforesight, i.e. the processes of generating and negotiating meaning and selecting \nsymbols that accompany meaning.  Such meaning and the related constructed symbols \nconstitute collective (social) knowing of the future and are thus inherent in foresight \nmethodology; i.e. in our \u201cmethod of knowing\u201d. \n \nWe draw on a body of social theory concerned with the way that meaning is produced \nand assimilated by society; specifically, the social construction of knowledge.  We \ninvestigate the power and the limitation that this epistemological position provides for \n\u2018methods of knowing\u2019 about the future.  We start with an explanation of the theory, \ndistinguishing it from its near-neighbour constructivism.  We then consider a few \nwell-known contributions for foresight and futures studies from a social \nconstructionism perspective.  We show that in some cases, it is an explicit feature, but \nin most cases it is, in our view, apparent but implicit. \n \nWe then turn to foresight methodology specifically.  We identify a range of general \nmethodological features of foresight work, without the necessity to adhere to any \nparticular episteme or methodology.  This allows us the freedom to investigate the \nnature of these features when considered from a social constructionist perspective.  \nWe do not claim the list of features as being comprehensive, nor is that necessary.  In \npassing we note the features appear to have resonance with some of the \nmethodological issues and concerns expressed by foresight practitioners.  Finally we \nreflect on the significance of a social constructionist perspective towards foresight \nmethodologies and ask what are the foundations that foresight is built upon.  Our \nconclusion is that foresight is both a social construction, and a mechanism for social \nconstruction.  Methodologically foresight projects should acknowledge the socially \nconstructed nature of the process and outcomes as this will lead to greater rigour and \nlegitimacy.  \nSocial construction \nThe central idea of social construction is that whenever we employ words or other \nsymbols to refer to objects in our social world, we are constructing them, quite \nliterally, as meaningful social objects that we can take account of in our actions [12, p. \n54].  There are several forms of constructivism\/constructionism and the \u201ccommon \nthread between all forms of constructivism is that they do not focus on an ontological \nreality, but instead on the constructed reality.\u201d [43]. \n \nConstructivism is part of wider framework of symbolic interaction theory [5,17,30], \nwhich is related to the sociology of action. Symbolic interactionism is the theory that \nexplanations of order and change come from the observations of everyday life and the \ninteractions between people, rather than from large scale social forces and natural \n 3\nlaws (Cf. structural functionalism).  The approach aimed to uncover processes of \ncommunication and interaction that allowed people to make sense of their social \nworld and for them to create or construct the structures that structural functionalists \ntreated simply as social facts [12, p57].  Mead argued that individuals give meaning to \nthe world by defining and interpreting it in certain ways [12, p53].  The premise is \nthat the world is never experienced directly, but through the ideas that we hold about \nit, and that these are communicated through symbols.  Such symbols are not \nrepresentative of reality in the sense of direct correspondence; their meaning \nconstitutes interpreted reality.  As Mead [30, p78] wrote \u201cSymbolization constitutes \nobjects not constituted before, objects which would not exist except for the context of \nsocial relationships wherein symbolization occurs\u201d. \n \nThe concept of construction in the sociology of knowledge was introduced by Peter \nBerger and Thomas Luckmann (1967), following Mead, Schutz\u2019s sociology of \nunderstanding, Garfinkel\u00b4s ethnomethodology, Durkheims\u2019s theory of society, \nMarxian dialectics, and Weber\u2019s constitution of social reality through subjective \nmeaning.  In \u201cThe Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of \nKnowledge\u201d they explored how, rather than having a predisposed nature, humans \nconstruct their social world. They argue that any action people undertake is shaped by \nthe different types of knowledge; not only scientific knowledge but cultural and \nexperiential knowledge including \u201ccommon sense\u201d and the knowledge people use in \nthere everyday activities (Berger and Luckmann, 1967).  Their thesis is that \u201creality\u201d \nand \u201cknowledge\u201d pertain to specific social contexts, and relations between them have \nto be included in any analysis of the social phenomena (ibid, p15).  It helps us to \nunderstand that we actively make and remake social structures and institutions during \nthe course of our everyday activities.  Thus knowledge, action and reality, in a \npragmatic sense, are not separate from each other and, they claim, can be combined in \na comprehensive theory of social action. (p207).  Starting out from two non-\ncontradictory statements, \u201cconsider social facts as things\u201d [11, p 14]and \u201cboth for \nsociology in the present sense and for history, the object of cognition is the subjective \nmeaning-complex of action\u201d [42, p101], Berger and Luckmann\u2019s investigation into \n\u201cthe manner in which reality is constructed\u201d (ibid p.30), marks an important \ncontribution to the sociology of knowledge, which we argue, is crucial in \nunderstanding methodological debate in relation to foresight.  \n \nThere is a range of perspectives and related methodologies that take a constructivist \nposition, a full description of which are outside the scope of this paper.  At a broad \nlevel, the terms constructivism and constructionism are often used interchangeably.  \nThe term constructivism tends to be used when referring to epistemology.  \nConstructivism tends also to be used in relation to individual (psychological) \n\u2018constructions of reality\u2019, whereas social constructionism asserts that meaning and \nunderstandings that emerge from the interactions between people, i.e. neither \nobjectively nor subjectively, but inter-subjectively.  A hybrid, \u2018social constructivism\u2019, \nsuggests that the individual constructs his or her world in the head, but with categories \nsupplied by social relationships [14, p 237]  Piaget\u2019s constructivist theory, e.g. [31,41] \nis concerned with how learning happens (accommodation and assimilation) and views \nknowledge as an active construction of the knowing subject, triggered by the \ncognitive system's need for order and stability.  \n \n 4\nAn extreme position that reality is \u2018constructed\u2019 is in some cases polarised with \nnotions of essentialism or realism.  The essentialist episteme is that forms exist \nindependent of human interpretation or thought and that all things, including human \nnature, have essential trans-historical characteristics.  Radical constructivists e.g von \nGlasersfeld [15] take the position that since all knowledge is socially constructed it is \nimpossible to know the extent to which knowledge reflects an ontological reality.  \nThis does not deny a real world exists, but does deny the possibility that our \nknowledge of it can be claimed to correspond to it, because human capacity to know it \nis limited to sensed interpretation.  \n \nHowever, there are many positions between the two polarised theories; they are not \nalways mutually exclusive when considered in the realm of knowledge and knowing \nand in the performances or actions that result from knowing.  There are \u201cweak\u201d \nconstructivist and \u201cstrong\u201d constructivist positions.  Some hold that certain structural \ncategories exist only because people agree that they exist (e.g. money, citizenship) \n[32, p202].  Others, such as Sayer, suggest that although ontological reality exists and \naffects our understanding, our knowledge of it is constructed and fallible.  \n \n\u201cOf course knowledge and social phenomena are socially constructed but that \ndoesn\u2019t mean external phenomena (including existing material social \nconstructions) cannot influence our interpretations\u201d [35, p91]. \n \nThe constructivist epistemology and associated theories of knowledge and action are \nimportant for foresight.  Foresight is intended as a precursor to action and is \nconcerned with the generation of knowledge about the anticipated consequences of \ndifferent actions, including historical actions.  Its authenticity and power relies on the \nrelationship between knowledge and action.   \n \nWe focus this article on the role of social processes in the construction of meaning \nbecause foresight, we argue, is a social process and its purpose is to construct \nmeaning. As a proponent of social constructionism, Gergen [14, p224] argues that a \ncommitment to the objective \u2018real\u2019 seals us off from other possibilities and in \neliminating a \u2018rich sea of alternatives\u2019 by quieting alternative discourses, it limits \npossibilities of action.  Social constructionism does not deny reality, it accommodates \nthe human and social power to generate meaningful reality.   \nSocial constructionism in the futures literature \nThe very idea of \u2018knowledge\u2019 about an empirically non-existent \/ \u2018yet to exist\u2019 space \nimplies a dialectic with the empirical real.  This could be read as \u2018subjective\u2019 \nknowledge versus \u2018objective\u2019 knowledge with a distinct sense that subjective \nknowledge is unscientific, unproven and \u2018made up\u2019, and therefore of little use and\/or \ndangerous to the status quo.  Such dualities are deep in western metaphysics, and \nsubject to considerable critique in the context of everyday practice. \u201cOf all the \noppositions that artificially divide social science, the most fundamental, and the most \nruinous, is the one that is set up between objectivism and subjectivism.\u201d [7, p1]  Tapio \nand Hietanen [38] demonstrate the inter-subjective nature of knowledge that is \ninherent in a variety of episteme used in futures studies.  They suggest that in most \nimplicit futures \u2018paradigms\u2019 knowledge and values (separated in their account) are \nsubjective or inter-subjective.  \n \n 5\nA search for the term \u2018social constructionism\u2019 in extant futures literature, yields little \nresult, whether via online databases or in the indexes of key texts.  However, \nconstructionism, at least in its weak form, seems to be implicit in much of the \nepistemological assumptions underlying futures studies.  We explore below a range of \nsignificant texts to illustrate this point.  Three notable contributions to the \nforesight\/futures literature make explicit their methodological relationship to social \nconstructionism; Bell, Slaughter and Inayatullah.   \n \nWendell Bell proposes a critical realist theory of knowledge for futures studies [3, p \n236], as a post-positivist and post-Kuhnian epistemology, and therefore more \nessentialist than relativist.  Bell claims that critical realism admits conjectural \nknowledge.  Writing on critical realism and method, Andrew Sayer [34,35] accepts \nthat scientific and social knowledge is socially constructed, i.e. the processes of \nknowledge creation, acceptance or rejection are social, but this does not deny the \nexistence of causal mechanisms or real external phenomena. This is a \u2018weak\u2019 \nconstructionist position of epistemological relativism, but does not imply ontological \nrelativism [35]. Extant knowledge, though fallible, can provide consistent and reliable \nmodels of the world and be shared between people. Similarly one person\u2019s \ninterpretation of knowledge does not necessarily stand in equal status to another\u2019s.  It \nis interesting that in his chapter on epistemological foundations Bell (with Olick) \nconstruct notions of future realist knowledge as posits, surrogate knowledge and \npresumptively-true (or false) predictions; stating that \u2018Futurists \u2026 make posits\u2026[and] \nconstruct (italics added) surrogate knowledge as reliably and validly as they can\u201d [3, p \n238], a process that seems congruent with weak constructionism.   \n \nIn comparison to Bell, Slaughter takes a much stronger constructionist line in his \nrecent writings.  He uses the (reflexive) connection between self-identity and the \nsocial construction of knowledge, as a means of elaborating the power of the inner \nself in society.  This is part of the Integral Futures approach, in which Slaughter \noptimistically casts social constructionism as a force for change for the better.  He \nargues that \u201csocial construction moves debates about the currently threatened world \nand its many futures options away from the simpler and immediate arena of externals \nto the process of self-understanding, self-constitution and mediation of power and \nmeaning at these formative levels\u201d [37, p110].   \n \nThe approach is consistent with Inayatullah\u2019s work (along with Slaughter and others) \nin critical futures research.  Critical social theory relies on an assumption that \nlanguage is constitutive of reality, and that the social construction, in language and in \neveryday practices of a particular event or category, privileges certain interests.  The \nuse of deconstruction to detect hidden or implicit meanings embedded in texts, and \nthe interests that such meanings privilege, is an important methodology in critical \ntheory.  Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) is a futures oriented form of post-modern \ndeconstruction concerned with \u201ccreating distance from current categories\u201d [20, p 816] \nand problematising such socially constructed categories in order to identify what \ncould or needs to change to produce alternative futures.  CLA is an analytical \nmethodology informed by critical social theory.  Its links to social constructionism are \nexplicit. \n \nOther foundational work in the Futures Studies literature has strong resonance with \nsocial constructionism.  Below we indicate how the work in Futures Studies on values \n 6\nand vision (Masini) and on conjecture and futuribles, (de Jouvenel) reflect social \nconstructionism. \n \nValues, as part of knowledge that guides human action, are clearly important.  Part of \nthe intellectual and social legitimacy of foresight arises from the acceptance of human \nagency and moral responsibility, which imply an interpretative and reflexive stance \nwith regard to knowledge.  Masini [26,28] does not separate values from knowledge \nin theorising about the way the future is constructed through the power of vision and \nprojects.  She argues that absolute values exist at an ontological level, \u201cmediated to \nthe existential level of man in an ongoing process of internalization\u201d (p1166).  Such a \nposition implies a realist perspective with regards to values, i.e. moral realism. [4]  \nHowever, her reference to collective mediation and her reminder that futures thinking \nis a learning process, suggests a \u2018weak\u2019 constructionist perspective with regards to \nknowledge implicit in visions.  \n \nMasini continues this line of argument by her commitment to the power of vision, \n(e.g. [28]).  Visions have power to produce actions with an intention to change the \nfuture, which in turn need to become \u2018projects\u2019 constructed as a base for action.  Van \nde Helm elaborates the theoretical underpinning of vision elsewhere in this edition of \nFutures [40].  It could be argued that although visions are in some senses \u2018personal\u2019, \nthe construction of what is desirable is more likely to be socially produced.  This \nproduction arises through languaging and interactions with others and through \nmimicry of desired social behaviour, whether real or imagined.  We suggest that the \nmeaning of \u2018desirable\u2019 is articulated through social interaction and becomes personal \nvision, need or expectation, rather than personal desires becoming social desires.  \nThus knowledge of what is desirable is inter-subjectively socially constructed.  From \nthis point it could be argued that even the extreme cases of utopian, ideological, or \neven dystopian, ideals, with their power to transform reality [25] become part of \nsociety\u2019s articulated desires through the process of social construction. \n \nTwo earlier formative ideas of futures include De Jouvenel\u2019s [9] \u2018conjecture\u2019 and \nfuturibles can be understood through a social constructionist perspective.  De \nJouvenel\u2019s conjecture is not truth and knowledge i.e. not empiricist\/objective, but \nlikelihood or possibility.  This perspective on futures studies is interpreted by van de \nHelm as the transparent construction of conjectures to be exposed to intellectual \ncritique, and not [a] search for the probable. [39, p21].  Masini [27, p22] proposes that \nconjecture helps us to look at the future on the basis of plausibility as a mental \nconstruct; suggesting a strong constructivist perspective, i.e. individual \u2018visions\u2019 are \ninner models of what is desirable.  However, it might be argued when informed by \nsocial constructionism, that the power of conjecture is the inter-subjective meaning \narising from the construction of the conjecture, through language, and negotiation of \nits probability.  Similarly, we would argue, that futuribles, or reasoned consequences, \nis a process of social construction \u2013 reasoning is a social, rather than a psychological \nact; reason has no performative power until communicated with others.   It is not the \nconjecture, but the way people act from the conjecture, exercising their own power \n\u2018from within\u2019 [9,10], that creates futures. \n \nFinally we turn to examples of current work on strategy, technology and foresight.  In \nrelation to knowledge and action, a modern practitioner Michel Godet [16] appears to \ntake a constructivist position in stating that creating futures \u201cis above all a state of \n 7\nmind (imagination and anticipation) that leads to behaviour (hope and will)\u201d (p8),  He \ndescribes as a \u201crebellion against determinism and chance\u201d, i.e. implying the power of \nagency.  This is resonant of Azjen\u2019s Theory of Planned Behaviour [2], which is \nconcerned with the link between attitudes and behaviour, rather than the construction \nof knowledge.   However, Godet also espouses \u201cthinking unconventionally and \ncollectively\u201d (p4), which is of course a description of a process leading to the social \nconstruction of knowledge: unconventionally i.e. non-normatively and collectively, \ni.e. socially produced.   \n \nIn the domain of technology, constructionism appears to be increasingly well \nestablished, as a report from the \u2018High Level Expert Group\u2019 of the European \nCommission Research Directorate illustrates.   \n \n\u201cThe future is there to be made. It is something shaped by people through their \npurposeful acts and through the unintended consequences of their acts. As \nsuch, the future is not there to be \u2018predicted\u2019 but to be socially constructed.\u201d \n[19, p17], \n \nAlthough this gives social constructionism an instrumental role, rather than seeing it \nas the way that people produce knowledge, it does reflect an increasing recognition \nthat scientific knowledge is socially constructed[22-24].  Social constructionism has \nenabled critique of scientific empiricism, leading to a recognition that even in the \ndomains of knowledge that have produced highly verifiable and \u2018predictable\u2019 \nrelationships (theories), the production of knowledge is a social process. A recent \nexample of this in foresight work is Selins\u2019 doctoral research on the shaping of \nnanotechnology.  In this case, she focuses on the social constructions of time that are \nnegotiated by heterogeneous actors who have a stake in the future of a particular class \nof technology, i.e. nanotechnology.  Selin [36, p136] concludes that temporal \nmaterialities of nanotechnology will \u201ccontinue to be reconfigured, renegotiated, \nrecoded, and hence re-temporalized\u201d, by the actors engaged in producing its futures. \n \nForesight methodology from a social constructionist \nperspective \n \nIf we are able to detect social constructionism in extant methodologies relating to \nforesight or futures studies, is it possible to synthesise this critical analysis into a more \nnormative perspective?  In the everyday practices of undertaking futures-oriented \nstudies, how should a constructionist perspective shape methodology?  In order to \naddress this question, we give examples of methodological characteristics that are \nconsistent with investigating futures (whether called futures studies, foresight or \nforecasting).  We are not suggesting that all foresight or futures studies methodologies \ncontain all of these characteristics, but we suggest that when taken together they \ncreate a distinctive methodological characterisation.  We recognise that this particular \nclassification is constructed and open to debate and that many methodological issues \nare subsumed in this classification.  Thus we are able to analyse and discuss ways in \nwhich a social constructionist perspective relates to the distinctive methodological \nfeatures.   \n \n 8\nThe approach is not intended to atomise a methodology into discrete acts, but rather to \ngive a sense to the overall implications of taking this particular perspective.  It is \nnoticeable that much of what is discussed is already known or assumed implicitly and \npracticed ad hoc.  However, there are also many challenges arising from this analysis \nfor what constitutes rigorous foresight practice.   \n \nTime (past\/present\/future). A pre-requisite for futures work is one or more \nconceptions of future time.    \n \nFollowing the work of Barbara Adam [1], it is clear that time has many meanings \nbeyond \u2018clock time\u2019. Adam argues that the meaning of time is socially constructed \nand that such meaning is performative.  Futurists are of course used to dealing with \nshort, medium and long-term perspectives, but it has been shown [36] that differences \nin the construction of time play a significant role in the construction of meaning about \nthe future (e.g. of nanotechnologies).  The generic methodological requirement from \nthis perspective is an explicit account of the construction of time within the context of \nthe study at hand. \n \nDescriptive difference:  Futures work is concerned largely with changes or \ndifferences from the status quo or present.  Thus a methodological characteristic of \nthe work is description of change, i.e. real or imagined changes in ontology..  \nAbstraction from whole worlds and re-categorising of concepts or events are \nfundamental to producing descriptions of different futures.  Such descriptions may be \nproduced by individuals or by groups.  They can be articulated in many forms, from \nan almost unconscious sensing that might accompany personal visioning processes, to \na highly explicit representation as story, scenario, movie or cultural dogma. \n \nFrom a social constructionist perspective the processes of abstraction and \nclassification are not dealing with the real, but with constructions of the real.  In \nparticular, social constructionism offers legitimacy for the generation of new \nconceptual forms of meaning that resonate with empirical observation and\/or social \ndiscourses.  That such conceptions may be challenged with regards to their power \nrelative to alternatives is a legitimate part of the process of knowledge development. \n \nRepresentation: it is typical of futures work to produce symbolic texts as \nrepresentations of generated knowledge about futures, often in the form of scenarios \nand stories, with illustrations. \n \nStrong social constructionism rejects the idea of correspondence between \nrepresentation and the real.  It builds on Saussure\u2019s position that the relationship \nbetween the linguistic signifier and the object signified is ultimately arbitrary, and \nthus meaning, as Gergen points out, relies on \u2018local conventions\u2019 [14, p25]. If all \nknowledge is socially constructed then it is not possible to prove correspondence with \nthe real.  What is important is not correspondence but the adequacy of the concept or \ntheory relative to observed world to provide explanation and a predictive capability, if \nconditional. A weak constructionist perspective, e.g. such as can be found in some \nforms of critical realism, would argue that although it can never be proven whether \nrepresentations succeed in exact correspondence, it is possible to move towards \ncorrespondence of the real.  \n \n 9\nMethodologically, the implication of this perspective is that any implicit or explicit \nclaims that texts and symbols about the future represent or correspond to the future \nare false.  Instead, such representations can be understood as having performative \npotential, i.e. may change understanding and activity through the way that people \ninteract with and interpret such symbols, and change expectations about the future.   \n \nProduction of difference.  Explaining reasons for described differences involves \narticulating theories and practice of causality, power and influence, i.e. what produces \n(or is capable of producing) the difference.  \n \nPrediction is not a word espoused in foresight, though \u2018anticipation\u2019 is used to reflect \nan expectation of being able to identify difference and its production over time.  \nGergen adds a further insight in a discussion on theory and in particular prediction.  \nHe suggests that prediction (such as the theories underlying the engineering of a \nsuccessful space landing) is created by a community interacting with shared \nmeanings.  He says that it is a \u201cmistake to hold that theories (as symbols independent \nof a community of actors) make predictions\u201d\u2026 \n \n\u201cFor when the words or symbols of the theory are cut away from a community \nof users is doesn\u2019t tell us anything. [\u2026] There are no consequences. [\u2026] \n\u2018Predictions\u2019 are effectively moves in meaning, born in relationships.  The \nparticular words themselves are simply partial constituents of a social practice \nwe call \u2018prediction\u2019. [\u2026] The creation of a prediction and its success are \ncommunity achievements\u201d.   \n \nThis perspective is profound in the context of foresight.  It situates knowledge of the \nfuture as epistemically consistent with knowledge of the past and present, in that the \nfuture is produced by a community interacting with shared meaning.  We would \nsuggest that implicit in this is the position that knowledge generated about the future \nhas a potential to influence the actions of a community which is equal to that of the \npotential of knowledge of the past or present.  Whether such potential is realised \ndepends on its interpretation, resonance and legitimacy by that community.   \n \nIt is necessary therefore to consider the ways in which knowledge is produced and \nlegitimated by different communities.  Rom Harr\u00e9 makes the point clearly when he \nsays: \n \n\u201cContext by context the balance between constructionism and essentialism and \nbetween realism and relativism, and how each pair maps on to the other, will \nbe decided in different ways in different contexts.\u201d\u2026 \u201cHow can [I] be a social \nconstructionist in psychology and a realist in physics?\u201d [18, p xi-xii] \n \nMethodologically, context is important, because dynamical properties of different \ncontexts operate in different ways, for instance, a political party acts differently from \na waterfall.  Different theories and explanations, even different epistemological \nassumptions apply to different contexts, as the quotation from Harr\u00e9 (above) \nexemplifies.  If a social constructionist perspective is taken, then such knowledge is \nconsidered to be socially produced.  The production of domain knowledge is different \nin different contexts; socio-political knowledge is produced differently from \nknowledge about the flow of water.  This would suggest that in the study of the future \n 10\nof a particular domain, the mode by which domain knowledge about the future is \nproduced (i.e. socially constructed) should be explicit, though not necessarily \nreproduced.  One tension that arises if the production mode of knowledge for the \ndomain is reproduced in producing knowledge relating to the future of that domain is \nthat the generation of novel (paradigmic) boundaries and novel structures may be \nconstrained.  An example of producing knowledge in a way that acknowledges social \nconstructionism but does not replicate the mode by which it is produced is the use of \ncritical theory by causal layered analysis [20], which acknowledges the hegemony \nimplicit in the production of texts but also deconstructs these.   \n \nSimulation: Studies of futures usually involve the generation of alternative worlds \n(from micro to macro). Examples include alternative scenarios, counter-factual \nreasoning [6], role-playing and computer based models.  \n \nAt face value, simulation would appear to be a constructionist, i.e. producing \nknowledge in the form of models of explicitly non-real worlds.  What can these be but \nconstructions?  The answer to this depends on the methodology used.  One has to ask \nto what extent does the simulation of the production of knowledge, produce meaning?  \nTo what extent is it performative, i.e. produces changes in activity of people?   \n \nLet us compare computer based simulation with role-playing as two methods of \nsimulating the production of futures.  It is not possible for the simulation of alternative \nfutures within a machine per se to produce social knowledge.  However, the social \nprocesses leading to the construction of the models used and the interpretation and \ndissemination of the outcomes of simulation, for instance within a research group can \ncreate meaning and produce socially constructed knowledge. \n \nRole play, where humans \u2018act out\u2019 particular events or situations is a social form of \nsimulation.  Amongst other things, role playing is used in anticipation of real events \n(e.g. in disaster planning), in order to prepare participants for the real experiences, as \nyet unknown, that they may encounter.  This would appear to reproduce socially \nconstructed knowledge which, because of the falseness of the situation does not \ncorrespond with experiences that will be encountered, but does enable participants, \nand observers to anticipate what such and event may be like in a real and therefore \nmore uncontrolled environment. \n \nIn both of these examples, knowledge is generated, first by modelling possible \nstructures and then by playing out and interpreting what is generated dynamically, i.e. \na simulation of events through time, generating (new) meaning from the known \nthrough social interaction.   \n \nFrom a social constructionist perspective the model is not a representation but a \nconstruction that provides a degree of adequacy in explaining the nature of the \nphenomena being explored.  What is important and salient is the meaning generated \nby the community that engages with the simulation, and what performative power \nsuch engagement has. \n \nCommunication of meaning: It is usual for the outcomes of futures work to be \ncommunicated to others. One could argue that foresight, as a project, cannot carry \nsocial meaning unless its results are communicated to or with others.  The texts, \n 11\nstories and symbols used to communicate about the future are languaged.  Radical \nconstructionists, such at Maturana and Varela [29], consider languaging to be the \n\u2018connection\u2019 between the individual and the experienced world; it is through \nlanguaging that resonance (and hence meaning) is constructed by the individual \u2013 that \nlanguage provides the \u2018structural capacity\u2019 to give meaning to the experienced \nenvironment.   \n \nAs social constructionism places knowledge neither within individual minds nor \noutside them, but between people, it is the acts of communication and the meaning \nnegotiated in those process that constitute knowledge, not the symbols used.  One \nsignificant issue arising from this is the degree of responsibility taken or given to \nforesight as a separate project from its constituency.  As a separate project, i.e. acts \nthat \u2018inform\u2019 policy makers or citizens, foresight cannot be responsible for the \nmeaning that emerges amongst its constituency as a result of being informed.  If \nforesight is expected to produce responsible action, then the production of meaning \nmust be embedded in its constituency. \n \nReflexivity, i.e. reconstructing meaning from a process of interpreted feedback.  \nWendell Bell suggests that Futures Studies is \u2018self consciously reflexive\u2019 [3, p 237], \ni.e. the production of descriptions of alternative futures can shape and change \neveryday understanding and performance.   \n \nThe concept of reflexivity is consistent with a constructivism, and in particular that \nour self-identities and social identity are shaped through the interaction with others \nand the knowledge available to us. Such identities are the result of how people \nmeaningfully regard their actions, and how their identities and interpretations of the \nexternal world are constructed and reconstructed from their continuing experiences of \nthat world [13].  This provides what Maturana and Varela called \u2018structural plasticity\u2019, \ni.e. the power of individual interactions to reshape and create meaning in and of \nsociety.   \n \nMethodologically, reflexivity is a description of the performative power of social \ndiscourse.  It suggests that by engaging in reflections of futures, which directly \nchallenge self and community identity, people can produce change.  Whether such \nchange is directed outwardly or inwardly depends on the agency and power available.  \nIt also suggests how the power of information can work, and furthermore that \nreflexivity is an ongoing process, producing ever-changing ontologies and discourses, \nand that any captured articulation of a view of the future is an abstraction of time and \nspace. \n \nParticipation.  It is common for futures activities, such as foresight programmes, to \nengage with human actors that have a stake in the future of the specified subject.   \n \nA central tenet of social constructionism is that without participation between people \nin making meaning (or sense-making) no meaning exists.  From this perspective \nparticipation between people is necessary to generate social knowledge about the \nfuture.  However, \u2018participation\u2019 in this sense has a wide meaning, for instance it can \ntake place through languaging and discourses.  If the results of foresight activities are \ndiscourses and actions about the future, then who participates in creating and \nperforming in these discourses has methodological implications. \n 12\n \nIn this respect a significant methodological issue is perspectivism, i.e. the conception \naccording to which the world is inhabited by different sorts of subjects or \npeople\u2026which apprehend reality from distinct points of view' [8, p 469].  There are, \nGergen suggests, great dangers involved in fixing a particular version of the real and \nthe good [14, p 235].  Participation by people who share a particular perspective is \nmore likely to maintain particular versions of the \u2018real and the good\u2019.   \n \nIf the future is created by a diversity of perspectives and the performances arising \nfrom these, then any look-ahead to the future should, presumably, acknowledge, \nsynthesise and assimilate the paths that such diversity is in the process of creating.  At \nthe very least, foresight methodology should reflect explicitly the perspectives it is \ntaking in \u2018fixing\u2019 the real and the good related to the future.   \n \nThus it is banal to suggest that the inclusion of \u2018stakeholder groups\u2019 in workshops is \neffecting participation.  It may, or it may not.  What is important is that the \nmethodology makes explicit the dominant discourses and languages through which \nparticipation in the generation of knowledge actually occurs \u2013 often done outside such \nworkshop activities.  Similarly the extent to which multi perspectives are somehow \nreduced to a single \u2018consensus\u2019, of a (temporary) fixed future is of methodological \nsignificance as is the way that this is achieved.  This is not just a political issue \u2013 \nthough has political consequences \u2013 but a question of the degree to which claims to \nknowledge can be made from single perspectives. \n \nAction: Futures studies and foresight are performative in at least two ways: i) they are \nconcerned with what produces different futures and ii) cognisance of expectations or \nanticipated future effects of present actions can change or motivate action. \n \nThere is a strong rhetorical connection between futures work and actions.  Often the \nexplicit purpose of investigating futures is to help choices to be made about what \nactions are likely to lead to desired futures.  Conceptually the radical constructivists \nMaturana and Varela suggested that \u201call doing is knowing and all knowing is doing\u201d, \nand thus do not detach knowing from doing.  Methodologically, from a social \nconstructionist perspective, it is the interpretation and construction of meaning from \nongoing everyday experiences that produce knowledge and expectations about the \nfuture.   \n \nThus action produces futures and also knowledge about futures.  Knowledge about \nfutures produces action.  Therefore, futures are produced through acts of producing \nthe future in which knowledge is inherent and co-produced by the actors.  Separation \nof action from knowledge reifies one or other.  It seems therefore that producing \nknowledge about futures is part of the act of producing futures.  The extent to which \nsome types of act have power lies not in the acts themselves but in their interpretation \nand meaning, i.e. in their social construction. \n \nExplicit \u201caction research\u201d methods are used in foresight, some tacitly [33], some \nexplicitly: for example \u201canticipatory action learning\u201d in which the \u201cfuture is \nconstructed within the terms of the subject\u201d [21, .p658] where metaphors are \u201cnot \nseen as universal but as particular to epistemic communities\u201d.  Such activities focus \n 13\nstrongly on the performative qualities of processes that engage communities to attain \nsuch visions.   \n \nValues:  There is a strong normative element in foresight and futures studies, when its \npurpose is to critique present trajectories, propose better futures, or elaborate expected \nor desired futures.   \n \nA significant criticism of constructionism is that it is inherently relativist, i.e. if \nknowledge does not correspond with any absolute truth then one account is equally \nvalid as another.  For Gergen [14] social constructionism does not carry particular \nvalues and has \u201cno position on relativism\u201d (p231).  Social constructionism accepts \n\u201cwhat is\u201d from an observable empirical perspective, e.g. the existence of poverty, \nAIDS, CO2 levels etc.  The methodological concern is about how such knowledge is \nproduced and how it is legitimised, not the legitimacy (i.e. correspondence) of the \nknowledge per se.  \n \nWe would suggest therefore, that adopting a social constructionist perspective in \nfutures work requires a methodology that makes explicit the values that accompany \nthe interpretation of meaning.  This requires an exploration of the dominant values of \nthe people or organisations that produce and validate knowledge about the future.  \nThis is far from easy to achieve because many values are inherent in the language and \nconcepts used to frame interpretation.  \n \nConclusions: the methodological implications of \nforesight as a social construction  \n \nMethodological choice depends on the intention or puzzle to be \u2018solved\u2019, and in \nrelation to this, the context.  There are many different aims of foresight activities \nincluding decision\u2013making, learning, exploration of possibilities, articulation of \ndesirable outcomes, sharing of knowledge, persuasion, encouraging action etc.  These \naims are set in many different contexts and are concerned with phenomena that \nbehave in many different ways, i.e. have particular ontologies.  The commonality is \nthat foresight activities produce knowledge in relation to a future time and such \ninstrumental knowledge is generated by social action, e.g. discourse, language, \nnegotiation.   \n \nIt appears that social constructionism is highly resonant with the production of \nforesight knowledge.  Central to foresight methodologies is the way in which \nknowledge is produced and used.  Methodologically, the accuracy of the knowledge is \nless significant than the process by which the knowledge is produced.  Gergen says \nthat social constructionism has no position on relativism.  However we argue that \nforesight does have a position on how the salience, accuracy and relevance of \nknowledge is accepted, rejected, modified and used by society.  What is crucial to \nforesight methodology is an explicit reflection on how, with what legitimacy, and to \nwhat social good, knowledge is produced.  These issues can be addressed \nmethodologically through the perspective of social constructionism. \n \n 14\nThis is not to say that the content of knowledge about the future is irrelevant, but quite \nthe opposite.  Relativism can be extremely dangerous in the creation of futures.  An \nunderstanding of social constructionism is essential for the moral and physical futures \nof humanity.  (Socially constructed) knowledge is fallible, partial, privileged and \ncontestable.  The process of social constructionism produces new knowledge, not as a \nmatter of empirical discovery, but as a process of creation.   \n \nKnowledge as a creative social process is a powerful explanation for the \nunpredictability of futures.  The future is built on the creation of knowledge and on \nthe way this knowledge guides everyday choices.  Work associated with anticipating \nthe unpredictable is constitutive of the future. What is taken as knowledge about the \nfuture becomes empirical. The powers that are enacted by and through such \nknowledge are real.  It is essential that such work is methodologically robust. \n \nThe analysis in this paper has indicated some of the ways in which social \nconstructionism guides the focus for designing robust foresight methodologies.  At an \noverarching level is the central concept that knowledge, meaning and subsequent \nactions are produced through the interactions between people.  In relation to some of \nthe specific characteristics of foresight methodology, this perspective requires that \nclaims to knowledge should take an explicit account of the: \n \n\u2022 Construction of time within the context of the study at hand. \n\u2022 Power manifest in representational choice  \n\u2022 Performative power of symbolic representations  \n\u2022 Mode by which domain knowledge is produced  \n\u2022 Meaning generated by the community that engages, and what performative \npower such engagement has \n\u2022 Degree to which the production of meaning must be embedded in its \nconstituency, in relation to the responsibility taken for subsequent actions  \n\u2022 Performative power of social discourse and challenges to self and community \nidentity \n\u2022 Dominant discourses and languages through which participation in the \ngeneration of knowledge actually occurs  \n\u2022 Interaction between knowledge and action \n\u2022 Values that accompany the interpretation of meaning \n \nForesight is both a social construction and a mechanism for social construction.  \nForesight, as a concept and as practice, is a social construction; there are many \nexamples of how society accepts the value and necessity of anticipating and \ncontemplating futures (e.g. risk assessment, planning, storage and tool-making), so \nthese activities are done.  These acts, often institutional, and which are part of \neveryday life and constitute preparation for the future, are socially constructed.  \nForesight as a process of contemplating futures is a mechanism for the social \nconstruction of knowledge.  In the process of enacting foresight programmes and \nprocesses, people construct knowledge.  Thus most significantly for this article, \nforesight methodology, the processes and perspective that provide an explanation of \n\u2018how we know\u2019 something, is a mechanism for the social construction of knowledge. \n \n 15\nThe above analysis has demonstrated that far from being a \u2018new idea\u2019 social \nconstructionism has been implicit in the foundations of modern (and post-modern) \nfutures studies.  We have shown that this is implicit in the way that more overtly \nconstructivist accounts (visions, hopes and fears, imagination etc) have been assumed \nto somehow form collective meaning and action and implicit also in the confluence of \nepistemological and ontological relativism.  However, because a constructionist \nperspective has been implicit, the well grounded foundations of futures studies are \nopen to less than rigorous interpretation.  We started this article by considering the \nplace of symbols in the articulation of futures.  It is easy to produce symbols of \npossible futures and in doing so make claims to knowledge about the future.  \nForesight methodologies that produce symbols without regard to inter-subjective \nmeaning neither anticipate, nor produce futures.  \n \n 16\nReferences \n \n \n \n[1] B.
