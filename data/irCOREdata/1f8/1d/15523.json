BACKGROUND \n \nPeople regard some deaths as worse than others (Sunstein, 1997).  For example, research has \nshown people are more concerned about cancer deaths than deaths from heart disease, motor \nvehicle accidents, household fires, or airplane accidents (Jones-Lee et al, 1985; Savage, \n1993).  Likewise deaths caused by industrial air pollution are regarded as more deserving of \nresources than deaths caused by smoking or automobile accidents (Subramanian, 2000). \nHence, it would appear that just as the acceptability of risks can be characterized by \n\u201equalitative\u201f factors, (Slovic, 1992) public concern about deaths might be aggravated by \ncertain underlying features of those deaths.  \n \nAs noted by Sunstein (1997) the risk perception literature does suggest reasons why people \nmight regard some deaths as worse than others.  More specifically, as well as the notion of \nlivable life-years (i.e., it is worse if a child is killed than an older adult), he highlights the \nimportance of \u201edread\u201f (i.e., death preceded by unusual pain and suffering), blameworthiness \n(i.e., responsibility for death lies with a third party), distributional equity (i.e., victims are \nmembers of socially disadvantaged groups), and high externalities (i.e., catastrophic events \ninvolving widespread non-pecuniary losses).  For example, cancer deaths might be more \n\u201edreaded\u201f than deaths from heart disease because they are preceded by a longer period of pain \nand suffering, whereas people who die from industrial air pollution are less to blame than \nsmokers are for their deaths.  \n \nThe UK Department for Transport (DfT), currently use a willingness to pay (WTP)-based \nvalue for the value of preventing a fatality (VPF) on the roads of approximately \u00a31.6 millions, \nbut how transferable is this to other contexts which have different underlying attributes that \nare weighted more or less heavily?  The Treasury Green book acknowledges that \u201cthere is \n 2 \nevidence that individuals are not indifferent to the cause and circumstances of injury or \nfatality\u201d.  It goes on to highlight that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), in assessing the \nbenefits of avoiding asbestos-related deaths- currently doubles the roads VPF figure to allow \nfor individual aversion to dying from cancer as well as the additional associated personal and \nmedical costs.  They go on to say, however, that there is no direct evidence to support the \nmagnitude of the adjustment factor used.  \n \nOne way in which such policy decisions may be better informed is to quantify the importance \nof each of the underlying attributes of types of deaths, such as \u201edread\u201f and \u201eblameworthiness\u201f.  \nThis type of quantification would then allow more general conclusions to be drawn about the \n\u201ebad deaths\u201f premium that people place on different types of deaths according to their \nunderlying features. It is unclear, however, whether people\u201fs concerns for different types of \ndeaths can be adequately captured by a manageable set of \u201egeneric\u201f attributes used to describe \nthe deaths.  \n \nThere is much evidence from elsewhere to suggest \u201elabelling\u201f the cause of death might affect \nresponses.  In the health state valuation field, Sackett and Torrance (1978) found that adding a \nlabel to a health state description significantly affected the utility values obtained: \n\u201etuberculosis\u201f was given a higher value than \u201eunnamed contagious disease\u201f, whereas \n\u201emastectomy for breast cancer\u201f was given a lower value than \u201emastectomy for injury\u201f.  Gerard \net al (1993) also found differences when the word \u201ecancer\u201f was used and when descriptions \nwere written in the third party.  Likewise, Rabin et al (1993) and Robinson and Bryan (2001) \nreport that adding a label significantly affected valuations of both physical and mental \nconditions, but found differences in the direction of these effects.  Smith (2008) found that \n 3 \nrespondents were willing to pay more to avoid health states labeled as \u201estroke\u201f and \u201ebowel \ncancer\u201f than their identical \u201egeneric\u201f counterparts.  \n \nThe impact of assigning psychiatric \u201elabels\u201f to individuals with mental health problems has \nbeen explored previously (Link et al., 1987; Loman & Larkin, 1976) and found to be \nimportant.  For example, the use of a label such as \u201eschizophrenia\u201f has been found to have \nstrong effects on people\u201fs perceptions and judgments about individuals with this mental \nillness (Link et al., 1987).  Fryer and Cohen (1988) found that hospital staff rated patients \nlabelled \u201cpsychiatric\u201d as less likeable and as having more unfavourable traits than patients \nlabelled \u201cmedical\u201d.  \n \nIn the current context, it is plausible that respondents\u201f attention to attributes of deaths might \nbe directed by their affective reactions to the descriptions used.  Just as research on the \nidentifiable victim effect has shown (Jenni & Loewenstein, 1997; Kogut & Ritov, 2005; \nSmall & Loewenstein, 2003), identifying the deaths by names may produce more of an \nemotional reaction than the stripped down generic descriptions.  For, example Kogut and \nRitov (2005) have found that people\u201fs ratings of distress and willingness to contribute \ntowards saving a single child\u201fs life was higher when identifying information about the child \nwas provided (i.e., their age, name and picture).  By identifying the victim in this way the \ncase becomes more vivid and concrete and evokes a stronger emotional response.  However, \nit is worth noting that this identification effect may be restricted to single victims.  When \nasked to rate their distress and willingness to contribute towards saving a group of eight \nchildren the same detail of identifying information about each of the eight children did not \naffect respondents\u201f willingness to contribute (Kogut and Ritov, 2005). \n \n 4 \nWhilst there are clearly a large number of potential factors that may influence respondents\u201f \nassessments, the research published in this paper explored this issue for deaths that were \ndescribed using four of Sunstein\u201fs attributes \u2013 the age of the victim (livable life-years), the \nseverity and duration of the victim\u201fs pain and suffering in the period leading up to their death \n(dread), and who is most to blame for the victim\u201fs death (blameworthiness).  More \nspecifically, the aim of the study was to test how well people\u201fs concerns towards these \nattribute-only or \u201egeneric\u201f descriptions of deaths matched with their concerns towards \ndescriptions where the specific cause of death is also identified (for example, as a driver in a \ncar accident) \u2013 \u201econtextual\u201f descriptions.  \n \nWhilst evidence that responses to generic and contextual descriptions are different would tend \nto rule out the existence of a generic model of \u201ebad deaths\u201f which would be extremely useful \nfor policy purposes, it does not, in itself, tell us that one description is somehow \u201esuperior\u201f to \nthe other.  Before reaching such a conclusion, we need to establish which set of responses is \nthe most valid.  One criterion against which to assess the validity of responses it to test the \nsensitivity to a factor that should have an impact on people\u201fs concern (Loomes, 2006).  We \nmight expect that, all other things being equal, people should regard more deaths as worse \nthan less.  \n \nA prominent issue in the willingness to pay (WTP) literature, however, has been the inability \nof that method to account for insensitivity to the magnitude of the risk reduction.  That is, \nrespondents tend to view safety improvements as a \u201egood thing\u201f and may therefore be liable \nto state much the same WTP for different sizes of risk reduction, whether for fatal or non-fatal \ninjuries (Beattie et al., 1998; Covey et al, 1998; Dubourg et al., 1997; Hammitt and Graham, \n1999; Jones-Lee et al., 1985; Jones-Lee and Loomes, 1995).  It is worth noting that a number \n 5 \nof studies have uncovered marked insensitivity even when the risk reduction is couched in \nterms of the numbers dying (see for example, Beattie et al., 1998 and Desaigues and Rabl, \n1995).  By way of illustration, roughly half the sample in the Beattie et al. study (1998) stated \nexactly the same WTP amount for an improvement that prevented 15 deaths on the roads each \nyear as one that prevented 5 deaths, even after this apparent anomaly had been pointed out to \nthem and they had been given the opportunity to revise their responses.  \n \nAs sensitivity to the magnitude of the risk reduction has become the \u201eacid test\u201f of the validity \nand reliability of the WTP method (Carson, 1997; Yeung et al., 2003), it seems reasonable \nthat other value elicitation techniques that set out to address similar issues are assessed \nagainst that same criterion.  Hence, if we find that sensitivity to the numbers dying is \nsignificantly different when contextual descriptions are used rather than generic descriptions \nwe would have an indication that the labelling has affected how the number attribute has been \nweighted in respondents\u201f choices. \n \nIn summary the aim of the research we focus on here was to explore the extent to which \nperceptions regarding the \u201ebadness\u201f of different types of deaths differ according to whether \n\u201egeneric\u201f or \u201econtextual\u201f descriptions were used.  Further, we set out to test whether \nsensitivity to the numbers of deaths differed across the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f versions of \nthe questions.   \n \n2 METHODS \n2.1 Materials \nWe elected to use a discrete choice experiment (DCE) in order to estimate the generic \u201ebad \ndeaths\u201f model based on characteristics of hazards such as the age of a typical victim, length of \n 6 \nillness or suffering preceding death, who is to blame for the death etc.  In a typical discrete \nchoice experiment (DCE) study, individuals are asked to choose between -hypothetical goods \nor services involving different levels of attributes identified as being important.  Optimal \nexperimental design methods exist that allow valid models to be estimated from a small \nsubset of all possible combinations of attributes and levels.  The principles of optimal study \ndesign, however, rely on all attribute levels varying independently, which limits the extent to \nwhich researchers are able to \u201eset\u201f attribute levels according to scenarios of particular interest.  \n \nAs the primary aim of the research reported here is to explore preferences over \u201egeneric\u201f and \n\u201econtextual\u201f descriptions of hazards, holding other factors constant, questions from a DCE \ndesign had to be supplemented with others designed specifically for our purposes.  These \nsupplementary questions allowed us to \u201eset\u201f attributes and levels according to scenarios of \ninterest and explore the generic versus contextual issue in a controlled and systematic manner. \nWhilst it is the responses to these supplementary questions that are of primary interest here, it \nis necessary to outline briefly the DCE design in order to give a coherent account of the \noverall study design.  \n \nThe questionnaire was in two parts: Part one presented the \u201egeneric\u201f (i.e. unlabelled) \nquestions whilst the \u201econtextual (i.e. labelled) questions appeared in Part two.  A series of \nquestions presented respondents with two premature death scenarios, labelled A and B, which \nvaried on one or more of the five attributes shown below: \n The numbers of people who die (either 10, 15, 25, or 50) \n Their typical age (under 17s, 17-40s, 40-60s, or over 60s) \n How much their quality of life is affected in the period leading up to their deaths (either a \nbit worse than normal or a lot worse than normal) \n 7 \n How long their quality of life is affected in the period leading up to their deaths (either a \nfew minutes, a couple of weeks, 1-2 years, or 3-5 years) \n Who is most to blame for the deaths (the individuals themselves, other individuals, \nbusiness\/government or nobody in particular) \n \nThese attributes and levels produce a total of 512 different combinations.  For the purposes of \nestimating a generic model using the DCE methodology, a fractional factorial design was \nconstructed that involved a sub-set of 64 scenarios paired to give 32 choices (see Louviere et \nal, 2000).  The 32 pairs from the DCE design were then divided between three Versions of the \nquestionnaire, with two pairs being common across all three.  As above, the questions from \nthe DCE design were supplemented by others to better address the specific issues of interest \nhere.  \n \nFigure 1a.

In each question participants were asked to rate which of the scenarios they \nthought was the worst by ticking one of four possible responses, namely: A is much worse \nthan B; A is slightly worse than B; B is slightly worse than A; or B is much worse than A.  \nThe first five questions were \u201epractice\u201f questions in which the attributes of both scenarios \nwere held the same except for one item.  Each of the five practice questions then varied a \ndifferent attribute.  \n \nQuestions 6 to 23 were made up as follows.  Twelve of them were part of a discrete choice \nexperimental design.  The other six generic questions involved five pairs that would appear \nagain in Part 2 with contextual information; but in Part1 this contextual information was \nomitted and only the generic information was given.  Two of these \u201egeneric\u201f questions were \nidentical to one another and were presented as the 6\nth\n and 21\nst\n questions, providing a test-\n 9 \nretest reliability check on responses to \u201egeneric\u201f questions.  This test was included to check \nthat any observed differences were due to a genuine difference between the \u201egeneric\u201f and \n\u201econtextual\u201f responses, and not an artifact of the questions being asked twice. \n \nIn Part 2, respondents were presented with the same 5 pairs they were presented with in Part \n1, but this time the contextual information was included as shown in Figure 1b.  Between the \nthree versions of the questionnaire nine different causes of deaths were used to reflect the \nrange of variation on the attributes (i.e., car drivers, pedestrians, rail passengers, cancer \ncaused by smoking, cancer caused by asbestos, cancer caused in the workplace, accidents at \nwork, breast cancer and carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning).  As shown in Figure 2 these \ncauses of deaths were paired up in a total of seven different ways with each \u201econtextual\u201f \npairings having an equivalent \u201egeneric\u201f pairing, identical other than the deaths being \n\u201eunlabelled\u201f in the latter.  \n \nFigure 2: Causes of death pairings used in each version of the questionnaire    \n \n \nCause of death pairing\na\n Version 1 Version 2 Version 3 \nA: Car Drivers \nB: Rail Passengers \n10 deaths \n10 deaths \n15 deaths \n10 deaths \n25 deaths \n10 deaths \nA: Pedestrians \nB: Breast Cancer \n15 deaths \n25 deaths \n25 deaths \n15 deaths \n \nA: Work-related Cancer \nB: Car Drivers \n10 deaths \n15 deaths \n25 deaths \n50 deaths \n \nA: Car Drivers \nB: Pedestrians \n25 deaths \n15 deaths \n 15 deaths \n25 deaths \nA: Smoking Cancer \nB: Asbestos Cancer \n50 deaths\nb\n \n25 deaths\nb\n \n 15 deaths \n10 deaths \nA: Accidents at Work \nB: Car Drivers \n 10 deaths \n15 deaths \n25 deaths \n50 deaths \nA: CO Poisoning \nB: Accidents at Work \n 25 deaths \n15 deaths \n15 deaths \n25 deaths \naIn each case, the \u201egeneric\u201f counterpart was identical to the \u201econtextual\u201f question other than it \nbeing \u201eunlabelled\u201f \nbExamples shown in Figure 1a (\u201egeneric\u201f question) and 1b (\u201econtextual\u201f question) \n \n 10 \n \nAs shown in Figure 2 each pairing was included in two of the three versions apart from car \ndrivers vs. rail passengers which was included in all three versions.  The number of deaths \nvaried across versions and in some cases evidence from piloting suggested which way a \nweighting would go.  For example, we knew from piloting that deaths from asbestos-related \ncancer would be given more weight than deaths from lung cancer attributed to the individuals \nthemselves being smokers.  So, in both versions the question showed that more deaths were \ncaused by smoking-related cancer than asbestos-related cancer.  However, as shown in Figure \n2 the ratio between numbers of deaths was higher in version 1 (50:25 or 2:1) than it was in \nversion 3 (15:10 or 1.5:1); likewise for work-related cancers vs. car drivers and for accidents \nat work vs car drivers.  As our sensitivity to number of deaths tests are based on responses to \nsuch pairings, the remainder are not discussed here.  \n \n2.2. Sample\/ Data Collection \nData were collected by means of small discussion groups comprising between 8 and 12 \nparticipants.  By using the services of a professional social and market-research company we \nrecruited a quota sample of 313 people that was broadly representative of the gender, age and \nsocial class profile of the general population.  Of the 313, 154(49.2%) were male, 159(50.8%) \nwere male.  The number of respondents aged 17 to 34, 35 to 54, and 55 to 90 was \n121(38.7%), 97 (31%) and 94(30%) respectively.  Two hundred and fifty three (80.8%) \nrespondents had no long term health problem that limited their daily activity.  \n \nThe group discussions began with a brief introduction to the aims of the study and \nparticipants were told that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) wanted some guidance \nfrom members of the public about whether more effort and resources to be put towards \n 11 \npreventing some sorts of deaths than others.  Part1- the \u201egeneric\u201f questionnaire -was then \nhanded out and respondents taken through the 5 \u201epractice\u201f questions (in which one attribute at \na time was varied), followed by a brief discussion to check for understanding.  Respondents \nthen worked through the remainder of the generic questions at their own pace with no further \ngroup discussion.  Part 2- the contextual questionnaire- was then handed out and respondents \nworked through the questions at their own pace.  A box was provided at the bottom of the \npage and respondents invited to write a sentence or two giving their reasons for their answers.  \n \n2.3 Analysis \nA brief account of the generic model estimated from responses to those questions that made \nup the DCE design is given in the Appendix.  The analysis and reported in detail here relates \nonly to those questions that-supplementary to the DCE design- that deal with the \u201elabelling\u201f \nissue which is the focus of this paper.  \n \nIn the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f questions the four response categories were scored 1-4, i.e., \n1= A is much worse than B, 2= A is slightly worse than B, 3=B is slightly worse than A, 4=B \nis much worse than A.   Both the test-retest reliability check and comparisons of the responses \nto the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f questions required within-subject tests of differences \nbetween responses.  We therefore used Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests to test whether the \nresponses to the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f questions were significantly different from one \nanother.  To test whether responses were significantly different when different ratios of \nnumbers of deaths were presented required between-subject tests.  We therefore used either \nKruskall-Wallis (when three versions were compared) or Mann-Whitney tests (when two \nversions were compared) to test whether the responses to each question were significantly \ndifferent between the versions of the questionnaire. \n 12 \n \nThematic qualitative analysis was conducted on the written reasons that participants gave \nwhen they answered the \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  Thematic analysis is one of the most \ncommonly used methods of qualitative analysis. As outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006) the \ntask of the researcher is to identify a limited number of themes which adequately reflect their \ndata. Unlike content analysis in which a checklist of codes are applied to the data \n(Krippendorff, 1980), thematic analysts create their codes by defining what they see in the \ndata. Codes emerge as the data is scrutinised. Hence, coding is a fluid process in which codes \nmay be modified or altered as ideas develop. Themes which integrate sets of codes are then \ndefined by the researcher and illustrated in the report with examples and, where necessary, \nnumerical indications of the prevalence of each theme. \n \nIn the present paper this coding process was conducted by one of the current authors (JC). A \ndetailed record was kept of the coding system and how it was linked to the original data using \nQSR Nud*ist 4 software. The fit of this analysis to the original data was reviewed by other \nmembers of the research team (AR and AS).\" \n \n \n3. RESULTS \n3.1 Test-retest Reliability Check \nRecall there was a repeated \u201egeneric\u201f question that was asked twice in Part 1 of the \nquestionnaire at Q6 and Q21.  Although the results showed that the variance in responses and \nproportions rating B as \u201emuch worse\u201f than A appear to be slightly lower for Q21 than Q6 (i.e., \nstandard deviations 0.86 vs. 0.99; 35.6% vs. 41.2%), the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test showed \nthat there was no significant difference in the distributions of responses between Q6 and Q21. \nThe test-retest reliability of the \u201egeneric\u201f questions was therefore of an acceptable level.   \n \n3.2 Differences between responses to \u2018generic\u2019 and \u2018contextual\u2019 questions \n 13 \nTable 1 summarises the results, aggregated across versions, for the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f \nquestions for those pairings where the ratios of numbers were increased in the same direction \nin all versions of the questionnaire.  \n \nFor each of the seven pairings from which we obtained responses from both \u201egeneric\u201f and \n\u201econtextual\u201f questions we report the percentages of respondents giving ratings from 1 (A is \nmuch worse than B) to 4 (B is much worse than A), the means and standard deviations of the \nratings, and the Z statistic obtained from the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests.  \n \nTable 1: Comparison of responses to \u2018generic\u2019 and \u2018contextual\u2019 questions \n \n % Response \n \n   \nA vs. B \n \n1 2 3 4 Mean SD Z\na \n(p) \nCar Drivers vs. Rail Passengers (N=306)      \nGeneric (Q21) 6.5 13.2 44.4 35.6 3.09 0.86 Z=3.48 \nContextual 7.5 10.1 28.8 53.6 3.28 0.93 (p<.001) \n      \n        \n        \nWork-related Cancer vs. Car Drivers (N=205)      \nGeneric 31.7 36.6 20.5 11.2 2.11 0.98 Z=7.81 \nContextual 61.5 28.8 8.8 1.0 2.49 0.70 (p<.001) \n      \n        \n        \nSmoking Cancer vs. Asbestos Cancer (N=201)      \nGeneric 20.4 20.4 30.8 28.4 2.67 1.10 Z=4.31 \nContextual 14.4 12.4 21.4 51.7 3.10 1.10 (p<.001) \nAccidents at Work vs. Car Drivers (N=206)      \nGeneric 37.4 39.8 16.5 6.3 1.92 0.89 Z=0.81 \nContextual 42.2 38.3 10.7 8.7 1.86 0.93 (p=0.42) \n      \n        \n        \n \nNotes: \na\nWilcoxon Signed Ranks Test \n \n 14 \nNo significant differences in the distributions of responses were found for  Accidents at work \nvs. Car Drivers \u2013 the majority regarding deaths from Accidents at Work as worse than Car \nDriver deaths was similar in the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f versions (77.2% vs. 80.5%).   \nSignificant differences were, however, found for the remaining 3 pairings for which these \ncomparisons could be made. \nCar Drivers vs. Rail Passengers: Although similar percentages of respondents regarded rail \npassenger deaths as worse than car driver deaths in both the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f \nversions (80.0% and 82.4%) the \u201econtextual\u201f version produced a lower proportion of \u201eslightly \nworse than\u201f (28.8% vs. 44.4%) and higher proportion of \u201emuch worse than\u201f responses (53.6% \nvs. 35.6%).  Work-related Cancer vs. Car Drivers: Just over 20% more respondents regarded \nwork-related cancer deaths as worse than car driver deaths in the \u201econtextual\u201f version than the \n\u201egeneric\u201f version (90.3% vs. 68.3%).  Smoking Cancer vs. Asbestos Cancer: About 10% more \nrespondents regarded asbestos cancer deaths as worse than smoking cancer deaths in the \n\u201econtextual\u201f version than the \u201egeneric\u201f version (73.4% vs. 69.2%) and the proportion of \n\u201emuch worse than\u201f responses were also higher (51.7% vs. 28.4%). \n \nThese findings lead us to the conclusion that people\u201fs responses to \u201egeneric\u201f questions in \nwhich the causes of death are represented by attributes only are not completely predictive of \ntheir responses to \u201econtextual\u201f questions which provide additional information about the \nspecific causes of death. \n \n3.3 Sensitivity to different ratios of deaths in the \u2018generic\u2019 and \u2018contextual\u2019 questions \nFor these tests the ratios of deaths in the questions were increased between the versions of the \nquestionnaire depending on which pairing of scenarios was used (see Figure 2). \n(i) 1:1 vs. 1.5:1 vs. 2.5:1 \u2013 Car Drivers vs. Rail Accidents \n 15 \n(ii) 1.5:1 vs. 2:1 \u2013 Smoking Cancer vs. Asbestos Cancer; or 1:1.5 vs. 1:2 \u2013 Accidents \nat Work vs. Car Drivers and Work-related Cancer vs. Car Drivers, \nTable 2 summarises the results for these comparisons.

However, the way in which providing this information affected sensitivity was not \nthe same.  For one pairings the sensitivity seems to have been greater in the \u201econtextual\u201f \nquestions than the \u201egeneric\u201f questions (Work-related Cancer vs. Car Drivers), with the \nopposite result for the other pairing (Smoking Cancer vs. Asbestos Cancer). \n \nOverall, there was therefore no systematic tendency for the responses to the \u201egeneric\u201f \nquestions to be any more or less valid than those to the \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  So we cannot \ndraw any definitive conclusion about which set of responses is by default the most \nappropriate.  \n \nHowever, these results also suggest that any conclusions we might draw about the relative \nimportance that people place on the different attributes from the responses they gave to the \n\u201egeneric\u201f questions might be quite different from the conclusions we might draw from their \nresponses to the \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  So if we take these results along with those reported \nin the previous section it appears that people\u201fs responses to the \u201egeneric\u201f questions do not \nserve as reliable proxies for their responses to \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  The reasons for this \nmismatch were explored by analyzing the written reasons that participants gave when they \nanswered the \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  \n \n3.4 Results of the thematic qualitative data analysis \nThematic analysis was conducted on the written reasons that participants gave when they \nanswered the \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  We were particularly interested in gaining insight into \nthe reasons why their responses to these questions were different to the \u201egeneric\u201f equivalents. \n 17 \nHence, the analysis was only conducted on the three pairings shown in Table 2 which \nproduced significant differences between the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f questions \u2013 focusing \nour attention on the reasons given by those participants who gave very different answers to \nboth questions (i.e., rated A as worse than B in the \u201egeneric\u201f version and rated B as worse \nthan A in the \u201econtextual\u201f version \u2013 or vice versa). \n \n3.4.1 Car Drivers vs. Rail Passengers \n28 of the 34 respondents who switched to rating B (rail passenger deaths) as worse than A \n(car driver deaths) in the \u201econtextual\u201f version gave written comments.  The majority of the \nreasons given were linked to the \u201eblame\u201f and \u201equality of life\u201f attributes that were provided in \nthe \u201egeneric\u201f questions \u2013 i.e., that the individuals were not to blame or were helpless (14 cases \n\u2013 \u201cNot the individual\u2019s fault\u201d [1005_v1]; \u201cThe individual is powerless to influence events\u201d \n[1048_v3]),  the greater suffering of the rail accident victims (6 cases \u2013 \u201cDue to the suffering \nthat they had more than to who was to blame\u201d [2063_v3]), or the violent nature of the death \nin a rail accident (2 cases \u2013 \u201cIn rail accidents parts of bodies are found everywhere along the \nrailway lines\u201d [1023_v2]).  However, a notable minority of reasons provided which seemed \nto be beyond the scope of the attributes presented the \u201egeneric\u201f questions \u2013 issues that \nexpressed the view that deaths should just not be happening on the railways \u2013 i.e., the \nrailways should be safe (10 cases \u201cWhilst all travel involves risk, when traveling by train \ndanger is not expected\u201d [1057_v3]), and rail accidents should be avoidable (2 cases \u2013 \n\u201cAvoidable by better maintenance of track and carriage\u201d [2044_v3]). \n \n23 of the 27 respondents who switched to rating A (car driver deaths) as worse than B (rail \npassenger deaths) in the \u201econtextual\u201f version gave written comments.  The larger numbers of \ndeaths on the roads was mentioned by 9 respondents (\u201cThe greater amount of car deaths is \n 18 \nthe factor here\u201d [1036_v3] ). Rail accidents were also perceived as relatively rare (4 cases \u2013 \n\u201cRail accidents are much rarer\u201d [1073_v1]), and trains were regarded as a safe method of \ntravel (3 cases \u2013 \u201cTrain travel is much safer than road\u201d [2013_v2]). Other reasons \nhighlighted how the context can raise issues that may be specific to the individual.  For \nexample, the importance of sorting out certain types of bad driver behavior (3 cases \u2013 \u201cI think \nmore resources should be put into stopping speeding although I think B is actually worse for \nthe people concerned [2094_v3]), or personal experience (2 cases \u2013 \u201cHaving been involved in \na car accident recently I am leaning towards this\u201d [1067_v2]). \n \n3.4.2 Smoking Cancer vs. Asbestos Cancer \n46 of the 51 respondents who switched to rating B (asbestos cancer) as worse than A \n(smoking cancer) in the \u201econtextual\u201f version gave written comments.  All of the themes that \nemerged were linked to the \u201eblame\u201f attribute \u2013 i.e., that smokers only have themselves to \nblame whereas the victims of asbestos related cancer were not at fault (29 cases \u201cSmoking is \na choice so if they are dying from smoking related cancer then its only themselves to blame\u201d \n[1003_v1]; \u201cIt was not their fault\u201d[2095_v3]), are unaware of the damage that asbestos \nmight cause (17 cases) \u201cPeople were not warned of asbestos damage it could cause\u201d \n[2065_v3]), or that business and government should take responsibility for people\u201fs safety \nregarding asbestos (9 cases) \u201cIt is the duty of business\/ government to lay down guidelines \nconcerning asbestos\u201d [1048_v3]). \n \n20 of the 23 respondents who switched to rating A (smoking cancer) as worse than B \n(asbestos cancer) in the \u201econtextual\u201f version gave written comments.  The most dominant \ntheme to emerge here was that the blame issue may not be as clear-cut as it looks (6 cases - \n\u201cPeople chose to work in certain industries even when deaths related to asbestos were \n 19 \nknown\u201d [1039_v3]; \u201cPeople who started smoking in their adolescence knew as much about \nsmoking related illnesses as people working in asbestos industry\u201d [2029_v1]; \u201cLung cancer \ncaused by smoking is the fault of business\/ government\u201d [1037_v3]). All other types of \nreasons were only raised by one or two respondents and included: the difficulties associated \nwith stopping smoking (\u201cIt\u2019s harder to quit smoking\u201d [1036_v3]); being a smoker (\u201cA lapsed \nsmoker\u201d [2159_v1]); or the difficulties doing anything about asbestosis (\u201cAsbestos damage \nwas done years ago and cannot be rectified now\u201d [2035_v3]). \n \n3.4.3 Work-related Cancer vs. Car Drivers \n30 of the 48 respondents who switched to rating A (work-related cancer deaths) as worse than \nB (car driver deaths) in the \u201econtextual\u201f version gave written comments.  The majority of \nwritten comments were linked to the \u201eblame\u201f and \u201equality of life\u201f attributes \u2013 i.e., the work-\nrelated cancer victims had no choice over the situation and their deaths were caused by others \n(14 cases \u201cThe individuals had no control\u201d [2027_v1]; \u201cAwful, why so many deaths, again \ndue to business or government. In scenario B, the car drivers are to blame for the deaths\u201d \n[2113_v2]), or that the work-related cancer victims had greater or longer suffering (10 cases \n\u201cI think A is much worse than B because suffering one-two years before death is more painful \nthan die instantaneously\u201d [2045_v2]). \n \nMore generally however, a number of respondents expressed the view that workers should not \nbe put at risk in the work-place (10 cases \u201cYou should not be put at risk in a work place and \nshould be protected by law\u201d [2058_v1]), or that these deaths could have been prevented (3 \ncases \u201cCancer could have been prevented if they hadn\u2019t been exposed to the chemicals at \nwork due to the business\u201d [1087_v2]). \n \n 20 \nNo respondents switched to rating B (car driver deaths) as worse than B (work-related cancer \ndeaths) in the \u201econtextual\u201f version. \n \nIn summary, the qualitative data highlight two main reasons why the \u201econtextual\u201f questions \nproduce different responses to the \u201egeneric\u201f questions.  The first reason is that the five \nattributes used to describe the causes of death in the \u201egeneric\u201f questions may not fully capture \nthe differences between the deaths that participants want to take into account when giving \ntheir ratings.  For example, in the comparison between car drivers and rail passengers some of \nthe reasons given picked up on the fact that rail deaths were regarded as worse because \nparticipants expect the railways to be a safe place or that rail accidents are avoidable.  On the \nother hand some reasons for regarding car accidents as worse than rail accidents picked up on \nconsiderations about the higher baseline risk.  Deaths from rail accidents were not as bad as \ncar accidents because rail accidents were much rarer.  The other main issue that may not have \nbeen captured by the quality of life attribute was some participants\u201f perceptions of the \nparticularly nasty nature of the rail accidents in particular. \n \nThe second reason is that the interpretation of the levels used to describe the attributes may \ncover quite a wide range of different situations and providing a context may make the \ndistinctions between levels less clear-cut.  This is most clearly illustrated by the \u201eindividuals \nthemselves\u201f and \u201ebusiness or government\u201f levels of the \u201eblame\u201f attribute both of which \ndifferentiated between the Car Accident vs. Rail Passenger and Smoking Cancer vs. Asbestos \nCancer pairings.  However, it is notable that whereas in the Car Accident vs. Rail Passenger \npairing more of the reasons for rating the rail passenger deaths as worse than the car accident \ndeaths were related to the fact that rail accident victims were not to blame, in the Smoking \n 21 \nCancer vs. Asbestos Cancer pairing more of the reasons for rating the asbestos cancer deaths \nas worse than the smoking cancer death were related to the fact that smokers were to blame.  \n \nThis suggests that the level \u201ebusiness or government\u201f was regarded as more deserving of a \n\u201eworse than\u201f rating when it was used to describe rail passenger deaths than when it was used \nto describe asbestos cancer deaths, and similarly the level \u201eindividuals themselves\u201f was \nregarded as less deserving of a \u201eworse than\u201f rating when it was used to describe smoking \ncancer deaths than car driver deaths.  In other words although participants may have accepted \nthat \u201ebusiness or government\u201f was most to blame in the cases of asbestos cancer deaths and \nrail passenger deaths, the actual degrees of business or government responsibility might be \nperceived quite differently by participants for these two types of deaths.  Similarly \nparticipants might perceive the actual degrees of individual responsibility associated with car \ndriver deaths and smoking cancer deaths quite differently.  As shown by some of the reasons \nfor choosing smoking cancer deaths over asbestos cancer deaths, when contextual information \nis provided people are able to draw upon their own knowledge about who is responsible such \nthat the distinction between individuals and business\/ government is less clear-cut than it \nmight have been when the description was presented generically. \n \n4 DISCUSSION \nOur study sought to establish the extent to which \u201egeneric\u201f descriptions where causes of death \nare described merely in terms of their standing on a number of key attributes (age, severity \nand duration of pain and suffering, blameworthiness) are predictive of the response to \n\u201econtextual\u201f descriptions where the causes of death are identified.  We find evidence of \ndifferences in responses between the \u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f questions, indicating that it is \n 22 \nunlikely that a generic model of \u201ebad deaths\u201f could ever be estimated in order to estimate the \nrelative weight attached to preventing fatalities across different sectors of the economy.  \n \nThe qualitative data suggest that two factors lead to differing perceptions between the \n\u201egeneric\u201f and \u201econtextual\u201f questions.  Firstly, some influential variable(s) were omitted from \nthe \u201egeneric\u201f questions (for example, the \u201eviolent\u201f nature or \u201eavoidability\u201f of deaths on the \nrailways).  It is possible that the use of a larger number of attributes may have overcome this \nproblem but there is always a tension between the need to describe the totality of influencing \nfactors and the need to arrive at a manageable set of attributes (Coast and Horrocks, 2007)  \n \nSecondly, when the causes of death were provided certain categories of included variables \nwere interpreted somewhat differently (for example, greater importance seemingly being \nattached to the \u201eblame\u201f dimension in some cases).  Whilst the problem of omitted variables \ncan be solved at least conceptually, there is no obvious means of overcoming the finding that \nthe interpretation of attributes is context dependent.  Thus, our study highlights the difficulty \nof trying to use a \u201egeneric\u201f set of attributes to anticipate people\u201fs responses towards a set of \nattributes where the specific cause of death is identified.  Similarly, Smith (2008) reported \nthat attaching labels such as \u201estroke\u201f and \u201ebowel cancer\u201f to health state descriptions led \nrespondents to generate additional symptoms and to interpret the \u201eprognosis\u201f information \ndifferently.   \n \nDetecting differences between labeled and generic descriptions does not, however, allow us to \nconclude that one set of values is superior to the other.  We argued here that \u201esensitivity to \ntheoretically relevant factors\u201f \u2013 such as the numbers dying \u2013 is one criterion against which the \nvalidity of responses may be measured (Loomes, 2006).  Whilst there are other criteria \n 23 \nagainst which validity may be assessed (such as insensitivity to theoretically irrelevant \nfactors- such as framing effects), we elected to focus on sensitivity to the numbers dying as \nthat has become the \u201eacid test\u201f in the WTP literature.  Whilst we found differences in the \nsensitivity to the numbers of deaths between the \u201econtextual\u201f and \u201egeneric\u201f questions, there \nwas no clear pattern to this finding.  Hence, it is difficult to point to any empirical support for \nthe superiority of one set of responses over another using that particular criterion.   \n \nIn the absence of any clear empirical evidence of the \u201esuperiority\u201f of one set of descriptions \nover another, we turn to more conceptual considerations of whether generic or contextual \ndescriptions are appropriate for resource allocation decisions.  Perhaps the most obvious case \nfor the use of generic, rather than contextual, descriptions is that the former aid resource \nallocation decisions in allowing comparability across competing programmes.  After all, if the \nspecific cause of death (for example, as a driver in a car accident) did not matter to \nrespondents, a \u201egeneric\u201f model \u2013 such as that outlined in the appendix could be used to predict \nthe utility of life saving intervention with any particular combination of attribute levels.  That \nis, decision makers could simply \u201eplug in\u201f the relevant characteristics of any particular death \nin order to estimate the relative weight attached to preventing a fatality of that nature.  As \nlong as the deaths may be described in terms of the same attributes, this would achieve \ncomparability in decision both within and across sectors responsible for health and safety.  \n \nPerhaps the most systematic use of \u201egeneric\u201f outcome measures is in the area of health.  In \neconomic evaluations of health care treatments and interventions health outcomes are \ngenerally valued in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) derived from \u201egeneric\u201f \nhealth state classification systems such as the EQ 5D \u2013 a measure which values five \ndimensions of health-related quality of life: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, anxiety\/ \n 24 \ndepression (Dolan et al., 1996).  Indeed, the National Institute for Health and Clinical \nExcellence (NICE) require all health outcomes to be assessed using the EQ 5D in \nsubmissions to them (NICE, 2008).  So, moving a patient from one EQ 5D health state to \nanother is always assigned the same value, irrespective of how that change is brought about.  \nIn this way, the health benefits yielded by cancer therapies may be compared directly to those \nyielded by treatments for dementia, heart disease, arthritis or indeed anything else so long as \noutcomes are expressed in movements on the EQ 5D.   \n \nAnother argument for the use of generic outcomes in health is they factor out \u201eemotive\u201f views \nof, for example, conditions like cancer and put all conditions\/patient groups on an equal \nfooting in the competition for scarce resources.  The issue of \u201eemotive\u201f views can be \nconsidered in the framework set out by Loewenstein and O\u201fDonoghue (2004) who make a \ndistinction between \u201eaffective\u201f system and \u201edeliberative\u201f system for decision making \u2013 where \naffective are based on emotive impressionistic reactions, and deliberative involve more \nsystematic weighing up of consequences.  For example, Slovic et al (2004, 2007) argue that, \nin responding to questions involving contexts that carry strong negative affect meanings, \nrespondents are less sensitive to probability information than contexts that carry less affect.  \nFor example, with hazards like nuclear power and exposure to small amount of toxic \nchemicals, the negative consequences of these risks may make respondents more concerned \nand sensitive to the possibility of these risks, and less sensitive to information about the actual \nprobability of these risks.  It could be argued that, in such cases, the affective responses \u2013 \nbased on emotive impressionistic considerations \u2013 are \u201edistorting\u201f responses and ought to be \n\u201efactored out\u201f.   \n \n 25 \nIn addition, the evidence from the psychiatric literature cited in the introduction suggests that \nlabels such as \u201eschizophrenia\u201f have strong, negative effects on people\u201fs perceptions and \njudgments about individuals with mental illness (Link et al., 1987).  This may be due to the \nfact that the \u201elabel\u201f of schizophrenia evokes stereotypic perceptions that may be inaccurate. \nFor example, people may believe that individuals with schizophrenia are violent more often \nthat is truly the case.  Assigning the label schizophrenic to an individual may lead others to \ninterpret aspects of their behaviour in a way that is consistent with the negative stereotype.  \nThis suggests that \u201elabelling\u201f the cause of death may induce a stereotype of the typical victim \nthereby biasing the judgment about the \u201ebadness\u201f of that death.  For example, labelling a \nvictim \u201ea smoker\u201f may evoke a negative stereotype of a typical victim that shifts attention \naway from the unpleasant nature of the death that would otherwise have featured in peoples\u201f \nthinking.  \n \nHowever, whilst there may well be normative arguments against the use of contextual \ndescriptions, the results of this research suggest that the public may well reject the policy \nimplications that arise from the use of their own \u201egeneric\u201f valuations.  So, even if we have \nreason to believe that public views of, for example, nuclear power and toxic chemicals are \nsomehow \u201edistorted\u201f, their existence does creates problems for decision makers.  Similarly, if \nthe public does have a strong aversion to particular diseases, then they may well reject NICE \ndecision making that seeks to factor out such considerations.  This problem may be \nexacerbated if public attention is focused on a single, identifiable victim as was the case with \nHerceptin for breast cancer.   \n \nOne solution to the \u201eproblem\u201f of the gap between generic and contextual valuations may be to \nadopt more intensive, interactive valuation methodologies.  In his review of the literature of \n 26 \nvalue elicitation in the fields of health, safety and the environment Loomes (2006) suggested \nthat policy makers should first try to elicit from respondents a broad list of principles on \nwhich to allocate resources.  The implications of these rules could then be shown to \nrespondents to ensure that they agree with the implications.  In the current context, the \nfeedback mechanism would certainly involve a discussion of the context and example of the \ntypes of decisions the general rules would dictate.  Were respondents to overwhelmingly \nreject the implications of general rules once the implications of the rules are made clear, the \nrules would need to be revised.  This suggests an iterative, citizen\u201fs jury, type approach to \nvaluation although it is an open question whether the gap between \u201econtextual\u201f and \u201egeneric\u201f \nrules would necessarily be narrowed by such a process.  \n 27 \n5 REFERENCES \n Beattie, J., Covey, J., Dolan, P., Hopkins, L., Jones-Lee, M., Loomes, G., Pidgeon, N., \nRobinson, A., & Spencer, A.

However, the opinions expressed in this article are solely the responsibility \nof the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the project sponsor.  The authors \nwould like to thank Aki Tsuchiya for discussing an earlier version of the paper at a Health \nEconomics Study Group Meeting.  \n 31 \nAppendix: The generic DCE model  \nA logit model was used which estimates the probability that one scenario in a pair is \nconsidered to be worse than the other based on the levels of attributes in each. As logit is a \nbinary choice model, we combined response modes \u201eslightly worse than\u201f and \u201emuch worse \nthan\u201f in the estimation process. Standard utility theory entails that respondents ought to be \nmultiplying the disutility of a particular type of death by the number of those deaths. We \ntherefore estimated a model that was multiplicative in the number of deaths as follows: \n \nP(B) = f{(N B-N A) + \u03b3age(N B*ageB-N A*ageA) + \u03b3severity(N B*severityB-N A*severityA) \n+ \u03b3duration(N B*durationB-N A*durationA) + \u03b3blame(N B*blameB-N A*blameA) + e}  \n \nwhere P(B) is the probability that a respondent will consider scenario B to be worse \nthan A, N A and N B are the number of deaths in scenarios A and B respectively raised to \npower  and i is the coefficient on the i\nth\n attribute  When  is set equal to one, all deaths are \ngiven equal weight (i.e., 50 deaths would be given five times the weight of 10 deaths). Values \nof  less than 1 indicate a declining marginal disutility of deaths (i.e., 50 deaths would be \ngiven less than five times the weight of 10 deaths); while values of  greater than 1 indicate \nan increasing marginal disutility of deaths. The remaining attributes enter the model as \ndummy variables with the omitted dummies representing the following base case: age (over \n60s), severity (bit worse than normal), duration (last few minutes), blame (nobody in \nparticular). \n \nThe disutility of this \u201ebase type\u201f of death was accorded a value of 1. We first estimated the \nmodel with  = 1, but a number of the coefficients appeared to have the wrong sign and did \nnot appear to fit the data at all well.  We then explored other values of . A grid-search \nshowed that the log-likelihood function was minimized (i.e. the multiplicative model fitted \nbest) when  = 0.2. The results of estimating the model with  = 0.2 are shown in Table 3. \nObservations were not independent (as each respondent contributed 12 observations), so \nstandard errors were adjusted to allow for clustering by respondent. \n 32 \n \nTable 3: The multiplicative \u2018generic\u2019 DCE model \n \n \nDummy Variable \nCoefficient Robust Std \nError \nSignificance \nDeaths offset   \nD*age(<17s)  .817 .065 <.001 \nD*age(17-40s)  .605 .055 <.001 \nD*age(40-60s) .355 .049 <.001 \nD*severity(lot worse than normal) .331 .035 <.001 \nD*duration(couple of weeks) .152 .045 .001 \nD*duration(1-2yrs)  .276 .047 <.001 \nD*duration(3-5yrs) .354 .053 <.001 \nD*blame(individuals themselves) -.259 .057 <.001 \nD*blame(other individuals) .526 .054 <.001 \nD*blame(business\/government) .537 .051 <.001 \nLog pseudo-likelihood \nNumber of observations \n \n-1839 \n3401 \n  \n \n  \n 33 \nThe \u201ebase type\u201f of death used in the model is: age (over 60s), severity (bit worse than \nnormal), duration (last few minutes), blame (nobody in particular.).  The deaths variable is \n\u201eoffset\u201f to make the disutility of the base case type of death equal to 1.  The remaining \nvariables are prefixed by a \u201eD*\u201f to indicate that they are multiplicative in the number of \ndeaths. The dummies on age show that disutility increases as the age of the typical victim \nfalls- i.e. deaths of younger people are worse, all other things being equal. Also in line with \nexpectations, the dummy for severity \u201elot worse than normal\u201f (compared with \u201ebit worse than \nnormal\u201f) increases the disutility of a scenario and disutility increases with duration of \nsuffering. The dummies relating to blame show an interesting pattern. According to the model \nthe dummy for blame \u201eindividuals themselves\u201f shows reduced disutility relative to the base \ncase \u201enobody in particular\u201f. On the other hand, the dummies for \u201eother individuals\u201f and \n\u201ebusiness\/ government\u201f both increased the disutility of a scenario.  \n \nQuantifying the \u201ebadness\u201f of deaths \n \nThe DCE model provides a \u201egeneric\u201f tool that may be used to estimate the relative badness or \ndisutility of various different types of deaths that may be described in terms of levels on the \nfour attributes.  If such a generic model were appropriate, we may use the coefficients on the \nmodel to estimate the disutility- or badness- of one death of a particular type by simply \nadding up the scores on the coefficients, allowing the disutility of the \u201ebase type\u201f of death to \ntake on a value of 1.  So, if the actual cause of death did not matter, we could simply describe \ndeaths in terms of the attributes in the model and calculate the relative badness of the two \ntypes of deaths. A couple of examples are illustrated below.  \n \nFor example, suppose we wished to compute the relative badness of two deaths which \ndiffered only in terms of who was most to blame for the deaths, holding other attributes \nconstant.  Consider two types of deaths- A and B- both affecting people over 60 whose \nquality of life would have been a lot worse than normal for the last 1-2 years of their lives, \nonly differing in terms of who is most to blame for the deaths \u2013business or government in the \ncase of death A and the individuals themselves in the case of death B. By adding up the scores \non the relevant coefficients from the DCE model we would get: \nUdeath A= 1 + 0 + 0.331 + 0.276 + 0.537 =  2.144 \nUdeath B = 1 + 0 + 0.331 + 0.276 + -0.259 = 1.348 \n \n 34 \nwhere 1 is the disutility of the \u201esingle death\u201f base case, 0.331 is the coefficient on \nseverity (lot worse than normal), 0.276 is the coefficient on duration (1-2 years), and 0.537 \nand -0.259 are the coefficients on blame (business\/ government and individuals themselves \nrespectively): the zeros included in the expressions reflect the fact that \u201eage\u201f was the same as \nfor the base case. The relative badness or disutility ratio between the two types of deaths can \nthen be estimated:  \n \n59.1\n348.1\n144.2\ndeathB\ndeathA\nU\nU\n \n \nConsider another two deaths- C and D -both involving quality of life a bit worse than normal \nfor the last few minutes of their lives, but which differ terms of the age of victims (the over \n60s in C and 17-40s in D) and blame (other individuals in C and individual themselves in D). \nBy the same method as above, this example would then yield a ratio of 1.107: \n \nUdeath C = 1 + 0.331 + 0.526 = 1.857 \nUdeath D = 1 + 0.605 + 0.331 + -0.259 = 1.677 \n \n107.1\n677.1\n857.1\ndeathD\ndeathC\nU\nU\n \n  \nOn the face of it, such a model would allow decision makers to simply \u201eplug in\u201f the relevant \ncharacteristics of any two types of death in order to estimate the relative badness of each.  \nFurther, the impact of varying a level on any one attribute may be assessed directly (e.g. \nchanging the \u201eblame\u201f attribute from \u201eindividuals themselves\u201f to \u201eother individuals\u201f) within \nsuch a tool.  Such a tool would be useful to policy makers attempting to quantify a bad death \npremium.   \n \nThe results in the body of this paper, however, raise doubts about whether preferences over \nbad deaths may be adequately captured in a \u201egeneric\u201f model such as this as context does \nappear to matter.  \n \n"}
