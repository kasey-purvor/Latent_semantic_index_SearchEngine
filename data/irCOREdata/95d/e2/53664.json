Subjects received five encounters with the same \nodour stimulus in the same context. For the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter all rats received a \nsimultaneous presentation of the original and a novel odour. We tested one group of \nrats, \u2018context-same\u2019, in the same context as before. For the remaining two groups the \ntest encounter was in a different context which one group \u2018context-different\u2019 had \nexperienced, whilst the other group \u2018context-novel\u2019 had not. We observed successful \nrecognition \u2013 based on a significant preference for investigating the novel over the \noriginal odour \u2013 for \u2018context-same\u2019 and \u2018context-different\u2019 rats, but not for \u2018context-\nnovel\u2019 rats. These results suggest that odour recognition can occur following transfer \nto a different, but familiar, test context, indicating a lack of context specificity. \n 2\nContextual cues, both external (e.g. Rodriguez et al. 1993) and internal (e.g. \nHolloway & Wansley 1973), appear to play an important role in animal learning and \nmemory (e.g. Spear 1973; Bouton & Peck 1989; Bouton & Swartzentruber 1989). For \nexample, social memory, the ability to encode, retain and refer to information related \nto a conspecific over time, can appear to be influenced by contextual cues such as \nlocation. Peeke and Veno (1973) demonstrated in stickleback fish that following \nhabituation of aggressive behaviour to a conspecific, dishabituation was observed \nwhen a novel conspecific was introduced. However, the aggressive response was \nsignificantly higher when the intruder was presented in a novel location than when \npresented in the same location as the original conspecific. Such a result suggests that \naspects of the environmental context can affect the social recognition of conspecifics. \n34 \n35 \n36 \n37 \n38 \n39 \n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n44 \n45 \n46 \n47 \n48 \n49 \n50 \n51 \n52 \n53 \n54 \n55 \n56 \n57 \n58 \n \n Wild rats live in large colonies consisting of numerous small social units \n(Barnett 1963) centred on areas of reliable food availability, i.e. rubbish dumps (e.g. \nLore & Flannelly 1977). Recognition of conspecifics, particularly those of an \nimmediate social group, may remove the need for continued reassessment of \nrepeatedly encountered individuals (e.g. Pagel & Dawkins 1997). However, for other, \nless frequently encountered members of a colony, unnecessary memories for \nindividuals may prove costly (e.g. Dukas 1998). For such individuals, identification \nmay instead be reinforced by the incorporation of contextual \u2018aides memoires\u2019 \u2013 with \nidentity closely linked with contextual cues such as location and surroundings. \nIndeed, it may be difficult to determine whether a subject is recognising an individual \nconspecific independently of the context in which that individual has been introduced \n(e.g. birds: Falls & Brooks 1975, Langmore 1998; mammals: Snowdon & Cleveland \n1979; fish: Waas & Colgan 1994). \n 3\n 59 \n60 \n61 \n62 \n63 \n64 \n65 \n66 \n67 \n68 \n69 \n70 \n71 \n72 \n73 \n74 \n75 \n76 \n77 \n78 \n79 \n80 \n81 \n82 \n83 \nIn our previous experiment looking at the effect of contextual change on social \nrecognition in laboratory rats (Burman & Mendl 1999), we found that following a \nswitch to a different, but familiar, test context, subject rats appeared to successfully \nrecognise a familiar juvenile conspecific. Recognition was inferred from a continued \nhabituation of investigative responses to the juvenile, despite the change in context. \nHowever, the omission of animals that behaved aggressively in this previous study \nresulted in a decreased sample size, so we decided to evaluate this result in the current \nstudy. In order to avoid aggression, we extended the previous study by using \nconspecific odours as stimuli, rather than the conspecifics themselves. \n \n Olfactory cues play a major role in the social behaviour of rodents (Brown & \nMacDonald 1985). Odours are used both to discriminate between individual \nconspecifics (e.g. hamsters: Petrulis et al. 1999; rats: Gheusi et al., 1997; guinea pigs: \nBeauchamp & Wellington 1984; ground squirrels: Mateo & Johnston 2000) and to \ncommunicate information about social relationships (e.g. dominance) to fellow \nconspecifics (e.g. mice: Hurst et al., 1994; Humphries et al., 1999). Evidence that \nsuch olfactory cues represent the identity of individual animals is demonstrated by the \nsubstitutability of urine or soiled bedding for live animals as social stimuli in \nrecognition tests (e.g. Sawyer et al. 1984). Olfactory secretions have also been used to \ndemonstrate apparent multi-factor representations of individual identity (Johnston & \nJernigan 1994, Johnston & Bullock 2001). \n \n The results of our previous study (Burman & Mendl, 1999) also suggested that \nrecognition persisted in a completely novel context, as demonstrated by a continued \n 4\nhabituation of stimulus investigation. However, this apparent habituation might \nactually have been due to increased investigation of the novel context, because an \nincrease in environmental investigation would result in less time available for \ninvestigating the stimulus, thereby giving an impression of continued habituation to \nthe stimulus. We addressed this latter issue here by using a different test of \nrecognition memory. \n84 \n85 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n89 \n90 \n91 \n92 \n93 \n94 \n95 \n96 \n97 \n98 \n99 \n100 \n101 \n102 \n103 \n104 \n105 \n106 \n107 \n108 \n \n We used a variation of the habituation-discrimination technique (e.g. Halpin \n1986; Johnston 1993; Johnston & Jernigan 1994). Following habituation (in terms of \na reduction in investigation) to the repeated introduction of the same conspecific-\nderived odour stimulus (see later), we then presented that stimulus, and one from a \nnovel individual, simultaneously in a test encounter. A significant preference to \ninvestigate the odour of the novel individual rather than that of the familiar \n(habituated) conspecific was taken as an indication of successful recognition of the \nfamiliar odour, whereas no such preference suggested recognition failure. In this test, \ntherefore, even if there is a general change, for whatever reason, in overall levels of \ninvestigation, we still expect differences in the relative investigation of novel and \nfamiliar odours to reveal whether recognition has occurred. This was not possible in \nthe test used in a previous study (Burman & Mendl 1999) and by others (e.g. Thor & \nHolloway 1982) where only one stimulus was presented. \n \nThis study also contributes to research on the effects of contextual cues on \nhabituation. Previous studies (e.g. Marlin & Miller 1981; Hall & Channell 1985; Hall \n& Honey 1989; Honey et al. 1992) have concluded that, unlike phenomena such as \nlatent inhibition (e.g. Kaye et al. 1987) and possibly even conditioning itself (Hall & \n 5\nHoney 1989), habituation does appear to transfer successfully to a different test \ncontext (i.e. it is not context specific) \u2013 provided that the test context is familiar to the \nsubject animal. \n109 \n110 \n111 \n112 \n113 \n114 \n115 \n116 \n117 \n118 \n119 \n120 \n121 \n122 \n123 \n124 \n125 \n126 \n127 \n128 \n129 \n130 \n131 \n132 \n133 \n \nMethod \n \nSubjects \n \nWe used 24 female (3 months old at start of study) Lister hooded rats (Harlan \nUK Ltd, Bicester, U.K.). These animals were selected because, at this age, female rats \nare able to remember the identity of a juvenile conspecific for at least two hours after \nan initial 5-min encounter (e.g. Bluth\u00e9 & Dantzer 1990), and have yet to show the \nreduction in social recognition abilities apparent in older rats (e.g. Taylor et al., \n1999). The rats were housed individually during the experiment in standard laboratory \ncages (33 x 50 cm and 23 cm high), with sawdust litter and an enrichment toy (a \nplastic tunnel that was used both as a shelter and a perch). Food (Harlan Teklad \nLaboratory Diet) and water were freely available. The rats were housed in the same \nroom in which they were tested, in a controlled environment (20 \u00b1 1\u00baC), on a reversed \nlighting schedule (lights off 08:30-20:30) with dim light (10 W) allowing visibility for \nthe researcher. \n \nApparatus \n \nTwo different environmental contexts, A and B, (33cm x 50 x 23, lit by 10W \nbulbs) were created with contrasting characteristics. They differed in orientation \n 6\n(context A: east\/west; context B: north\/south), floor type (context A: plastic; context \nB: wire mesh), and floor\/wall colour (context A: white; context B: black). In order to \nensure that the subjects were able to move equally freely and see cues equally clearly \nin both contexts, we kept cage size and lighting the same. \n134 \n135 \n136 \n137 \n138 \n139 \n140 \n141 \n142 \n143 \n144 \n145 \n146 \n147 \n148 \n149 \n150 \n151 \n152 \n153 \n154 \n155 \n156 \n157 \n \nTreatments \n \nRats were allocated at random to the three different treatment groups \n(\u2018context-same\u2019, \u2018context-different\u2019, \u2018context-novel\u2019) (see Figure 1), with N=8 \nanimals in each group. We tested three rats each day, one from each treatment, with \ntreatment order determined randomly. Half of the rats in each treatment began the \nexperiment in context A, the other half began the experiment in context B. This \ndesign allowed for differences between the two contexts to be detected. \n \nPrior experience \n \nRats in the \u2018context-different\u2019 treatment were given experience of both \ncontexts prior to testing, whilst rats in the \u2018context-same\u2019 and \u2018context-novel\u2019 \ntreatments were given no experience of either context A or context B before testing \nbegan. This prior experience was achieved by introducing the subject rats into the two \ndifferent contexts for 20-minute periods, once a day for four days, with the last day of \ncontext familiarisation taking place 24 hours before each particular subject rat was to \nbe tested. This difference in experience was intended to ensure that when \u2018context-\ndifferent\u2019 rats were switched to a new context, the new context would be different, but \n 7\nfamiliar, whereas when \u2018context-novel\u2019 rats were switched to a new context, it would \nbe completely novel. \n158 \n159 \n160 \n161 \n162 \n163 \n164 \n165 \n166 \n167 \n168 \n169 \n170 \n171 \n172 \n173 \n174 \n175 \n176 \n177 \n178 \n179 \n180 \n181 \n182 \n \n*Figure 1* \n \nProcedure \n \n The experimental procedure consisted of introducing a subject rat to one of the \ncontexts, either A or B, which contained an odour sample (see below) from a novel \nrat, for a five-minute period. During this encounter, total investigation (s) of the odour \nsample by the subject rat was recorded. Following this initial encounter, the subject \nrat was returned to its home cage for a 15-minute interval before being reintroduced \nto the same context and the same odour sample for a second encounter. Again, \ninvestigation of the odour sample was recorded for five minutes. This procedure was \nrepeated for five consecutive encounters. \n \nFifteen minutes after the fifth encounter, a sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter took place in \nwhich the subject was exposed, for five minutes, to both the odour sample of the \noriginal conspecific and that of a completely novel individual. For \u2018context-same\u2019 rats \nthis sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter took place in the same context as for the previous five \nencounters, whereas rats in the \u2018context-different\u2019 and \u2018context-novel\u2019 treatments \nwere switched to a new context for the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter. For \u2018context-different\u2019 \nrats this new context was familiar, but for \u2018context-novel\u2019 rats it was completely novel \n(see \u2018previous experience\u2019). \n \n 8\n The \u2018context-novel\u2019 rats then received an additional seventh five-minute \nencounter with the same odour cues in the same context as for the sixth encounter, \nhaving spent 15 minutes, with no odour cues present, in that same context. We \nincluded this additional \u2018test\u2019 encounter because, if discrimination was not occurring \nin the sixth encounter due to the time spent investigating the novel environment, then, \nby allowing the rats extra time to explore that environment (between the sixth and \nseventh encounters), it was hoped that the novelty of the environment would be \nreduced - and subsequent discrimination become possible. \n183 \n184 \n185 \n186 \n187 \n188 \n189 \n190 \n191 \n192 \n193 \n194 \n195 \n196 \n197 \n198 \n199 \n200 \n201 \n202 \n203 \n204 \n205 \n206 \n207 \n \nBehavioural observations and odour samples \n \nInvestigation of the two odour samples by the subjects was recorded directly \nusing an event recorder (Psion Organiser II) with Noldus Observer software (Noldus \nInformation Technology 1993). Investigation included sniffing, licking, and\/or the \nsubject\u2019s nose being held within one cm of an odour container, with the majority of \nnon-stimulus investigation directed towards exploration of the environmental context. \nEach subject rat was used once as a subject, and twice as an odour donor. Odour cues \nconsisted of 10cm\u00b3 of four-day old soiled bedding from the home cage of donor rats \npresented in spherical wire mesh containers (total volume 20 cm\u00b3) secured to the cage \nwall. These containers allowed the rats to investigate the odour stimulus without \ndisturbing it. \n \nAll odour cues were collected at the same time immediately prior to testing, \nwith the result that both the familiar odour stimulus and that of the novel individual \nwere the same \u2018age\u2019 when introduced for the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter. The containers \n 9\ncontaining the odour cues were changed and disinfected (Virkon, Antec International) \nbetween each encounter to prevent odour deposition by the subject rats. During the \nfirst five encounters, the odour cue was placed centrally at one end of the home cage \n(16.5cm from either side). For the test encounter, one of the odour cues was placed \ncentrally on the left of the home cage, the other on the right (both 25cm from either \nend), and this was balanced across treatments to control for possible side preference. \n208 \n209 \n210 \n211 \n212 \n213 \n214 \n215 \n216 \n217 \n218 \n219 \n220 \n221 \n222 \n223 \n224 \n225 \n226 \n227 \n228 \n229 \n230 \n231 \n232 \n \nData analysis \n \nThe different treatments were analysed (Minitab) to examine whether: (1) \nprior experience of the context affected investigation time during the five exposures \nto a novel odour stimulus; (2) the two contexts differed in their influence on subject \nbehaviour; (3) rats habituated after five presentations to the same odour stimulus; (4) \nrats successfully discriminated between the familiar and a novel odour when tested in \neither the same, a different (familiar), or novel test context; (5) exposure to a novel \ncontext resulted in decreased investigation; (6) after 15-mins in the formerly novel \ncontext, investigation increased. \n \nResults \n \nThe total amount of investigation (seconds) directed towards the odour stimuli for \neach treatment over the six\/seven 5-min encounters is presented in Fig. 2 (a - c). \nOverall investigation of odour stimuli (mean investigation in encounter one: 30.8s) \nwas lower than that observed for live juvenile conspecifics in previous studies (e.g. \n70.5s: Burman & Mendl 2000). However, previous research has indicated that both \n 10\nurine and soiled bedding can be used successfully to replace live conspecifics as \nstimuli in social recognition tests (Sawyer et al., 1984). \n233 \n234 \n235 \n236 \n237 \n238 \n239 \n240 \n241 \n242 \n243 \n244 \n245 \n246 \n247 \n248 \n249 \n250 \n251 \n252 \n253 \n254 \n255 \n256 \n257 \n \nEncounters 1-5 \n \nA repeated measures General Linear Model (GLM) with previous experience \n(yes\/no), context (A\/B), and encounter (1-5) as factors, was carried out on the \ninvestigation data which were both normal and with similar variances. For the first \nfive encounters analysed here \u2018context-same\u2019 and \u2018context-novel\u2019 rats, both without \nprior experience of either context, were combined because, at this point in the \nexperiment, there was no difference in treatment between these two groups of rats, \nnor did they differ significantly in levels of investigation (F1,14=0.98, NS). This test \nrevealed that those rats with previous experience of both contexts (\u2018context-different\u2019) \ninvestigated the odour stimuli significantly more than those without experience \n(\u2018context-same\u2019 & \u2018context-novel\u2019) (F1,20=7.9, P<0.05). No difference in total \ninvestigation was observed between contexts A and B. There was a highly significant \neffect of encounter (1-5) on investigation (F4,80=23.97, P<0.001), and a significant \ninteraction between experience and encounter (F4,80=2.7, P<0.05). \n \nPost-hoc analysis, in which context data were pooled and data for experienced \nand inexperienced groups analysed separately, revealed that for those rats without \nexperience there was a significant drop (Tukey\u2019s Pairwise Comparison, P<0.05) in \ninvestigation (means \u00b1 SE: 25.8\u00b12.9, 17.1\u00b12.1, 17\u00b11.9, 11.3\u00b12.1, 6.3\u00b11.3, \nrespectively) between encounters 1 & 2, 1 & 3, 1 & 4, 1 & 5, 2 & 5, and 3 & 5. For \nexperienced rats (\u2018context-different\u2019) (means \u00b1 SE: 40.8\u00b15.1, 25.5\u00b14.1, 15.4\u00b12.9, \n 11\n20.3\u00b14.3, 12.3\u00b12.9, respectively) significant reductions in investigation were \nobserved between encounters 1 & 2, 1 & 3, 1 & 4, and 1 & 5. \n258 \n259 \n260 \n261 \n262 \n263 \n264 \n265 \n266 \n267 \n268 \n269 \n270 \n271 \n272 \n273 \n274 \n275 \n276 \n277 \n278 \n279 \n280 \n281 \n282 \n \n*Figure 2 (a-c)* \n \nEncounter 6 \n \nA repeated measures GLM was used to investigate data from the sixth \u2018test\u2019 \nencounter with treatment (\u2018context-same\u2019\/\u2018context-novel\u2019\/\u2018context-different\u2019), context \n(A\/B) and odour (novel\/same) as factors. We found a significant difference between \ntreatments (F2,36=6.86, P<0.01), and no difference between contexts. Subject rats \ninvestigated the novel odour stimulus significantly more than the familiar (original) \nstimulus (F1,18=32.16, P<0.001). Post-hoc analysis of the treatment effect, revealed \nthat both \u2018context same\u2019 and \u2018context different\u2019 rats investigated the odour cues \nsignificantly more than \u2018context novel\u2019 animals (Tukey\u2019s Pairwise Comparison, \nP<0.05) (means \u00b1 SE: 36.5\u00b14.25 (\u2018context same\u2019), 30.1\u00b13.55 (\u2018context different\u2019), \n16.9\u00b13.18 (\u2018context novel\u2019).  \n \nThere were no significant interaction effects in the model, although the \ninteraction between treatment and odour approached significance (F2,36=2.97, \nP=0.077). This seemed to be due to less clear discrimination between the novel and \nfamiliar odours in the \u2018context novel\u2019 group (see Fig. 2), and therefore necessitated \nfurther analysis - in order to avoid any misinterpretation of the apparent overall \npreference of the rats for investigating the novel odour stimulus. We used either \npaired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (both two-tailed), depending on whether \n 12\nor not the data met requirements for normality and homogeneity of variance. \n\u2018Context-same\u2019 (t\n283 \n284 \n285 \n286 \n287 \n288 \n289 \n290 \n291 \n292 \n293 \n294 \n295 \n296 \n297 \n298 \n299 \n300 \n301 \n302 \n303 \n304 \n305 \n306 \n307 \n8=5.19, P=0.001) and \u2018context-different\u2019 (t8=4.15, P<0.01) rats both \ninvestigated the odour of a novel conspecific significantly more than that of a familiar \nindividual. In contrast, the \u2018context-novel\u2019 rats (T=30, N=8, P=0.107) showed no such \npreference. \n \nEncounter 7 \n \nA final analysis compared the investigation of the novel and familiar odour \ncues between the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter and the subsequent seventh encounter for \n\u2018context-novel\u2019 rats. During the 15-min period between these tests the subjects \nremained in the previously novel environmental context. A GLM with encounter (6\/7) \nand odour (novel\/same) as repeated factors revealed that, whilst there was no \nsignificant difference in the time spent investigating novel as compared to familiar \nodour stimuli (F1,7=1.86, NS), the rats investigated the stimuli at a significantly higher \nlevel in the seventh encounter than in the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter (F1,7=6.31; P<0.05). \n \nDiscussion \n \nHabituation, in terms of declining amounts of investigation, occurred over five \nseparate encounters with an odour stimulus obtained from the same individual, with \nall treatments showing a reduction of investigation between the first and the fifth \nencounters. For the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter, \u2018context-same\u2019 and \u2018context-different\u2019 rats \npreferred to investigate the odour of a novel, rather than familiar, individual - which \nsuggests successful recognition of the familiar (habituated) odour (see introduction, \n 13\ncf. Johnston 1993). The switch to a different, but familiar, environmental context did \nnot therefore appear to disrupt social recognition. \n308 \n309 \n310 \n311 \n312 \n313 \n314 \n315 \n316 \n317 \n318 \n319 \n320 \n321 \n322 \n323 \n324 \n325 \n326 \n327 \n328 \n329 \n330 \n331 \n332 \n \nIn contrast, the apparent failure to discriminate between the novel and familiar \nodours in the novel context during the sixth \u2018test\u2019 encounter indicates that a switch to \na different, and entirely novel, context interfered with stimulus discrimination. In that \nsixth encounter, the \u2018context-novel\u2019 rats investigated the odour stimuli significantly \nless than those rats that were familiar with the test context. It therefore seems likely \nthat this reduction in investigation was caused, at least in part, by a redirection of \nbehaviour away from investigation and towards the exploration of the novel \nenvironment (cf. Burman & Mendl 1999). \n \nThis explanation is supported by the observed increase in investigation of the \nodour stimuli in the seventh encounter, following a further 15-min experience of the \nnovel test context. After the rats had gained that additional experience of the novel \nenvironment between the 6th and 7th encounters, they may have had more time \navailable to investigate the odour stimuli because they were spending less time \nexploring the environment. Alternatively, exposure to the novel environment may \nhave caused an increase in excitability, resulting in sensitisation to the presence of the \nodour stimuli (e.g. Thompson & Spencer 1966), and a subsequent increase in stimulus \ninvestigation. \n \nHowever, despite this increase in overall stimulus investigation in the seventh \nencounter, the rats still appeared unable to discriminate between the novel and \nfamiliar stimuli. This suggests a further effect of the novel context on subject \n 14\nbehaviour, in addition to the apparent redirection of behaviour away from the \nstimulus and to the surrounding environment. A possible explanation could be that \nany stress caused by switching the rats to an entirely novel context might be sufficient \nto disrupt the discrimination process. This would reflect the results of a previous \nstudy (Burman & Mendl 2000) in which a 5-min exposure to a novel environmental \ncontext in between two introductions to the same juvenile conspecific, appeared to \ninterfere with the recognition of that familiar individual. \n333 \n334 \n335 \n336 \n337 \n338 \n339 \n340 \n341 \n342 \n343 \n344 \n345 \n346 \n347 \n348 \n349 \n350 \n351 \n352 \n353 \n354 \n355 \n356 \n357 \n \nIt should be noted that there are potential explanations for the observed results \nbased solely on the design of the environmental contexts. For example, each context \nneeds to be sufficiently distinguishable from the other, but without causing a \ndiscrepancy in the subjects\u2019 perception of the stimuli. However, throughout this \nexperiment no difference in investigative behaviour was recorded between the two \ncontexts, suggesting that it was unlikely that any of the observed changes in \nbehavioural response upon a context switch were due solely to differing stimulus \nperception between the two different contexts (e.g. Lovibond et al. 1984; Hall & \nHoney 1989). The change in behaviour when rats were switched to a novel test \ncontext also provides some post-hoc evidence that the two different environmental \ncontexts were sufficiently distinguishable from each other in this study (e.g. Gordon \n& Klein 1994). \n \nThe results of this study confirm the findings of our previous project (Burman \n& Mendl 1999), in which, because of the effect of aggression and reduced sample \nsize, the conclusion that stimulus recognition had occurred following a switch to a \ndifferent, but familiar test context, required further evaluation. This study also \n 15\nsuggests that the continued habituation of investigation observed after a switch to a \nnovel context in our previous study was at least partly due to competing responses \nrestricting the subjects\u2019 available time for stimulus investigation. In addition, this \nstudy provides further evidence that if odour cues alone are used as social stimuli, \nrather than conspecifics, then discrimination is still possible by subject rats (e.g. Carr \net al. 1976; Sawyer et al. 1984; Gheusi et al. 1997) whilst ensuring that any potential \naggression between individuals is avoided. The use of odour cues in the \nhabituation\/discrimination procedure (e.g. Johnston 1993; Johnston & Jernigan 1994), \nis an important alternative to the use of live individuals because it also excludes the \npossibility that the behaviour of the introduced animal could be influencing the \nbehaviour of the subject. \n358 \n359 \n360 \n361 \n362 \n363 \n364 \n365 \n366 \n367 \n368 \n369 \n370 \n371 \n372 \n373 \n374 \n375 \n376 \n377 \n378 \n379 \n380 \n381 \n382 \n \n It therefore appears that \u2013 for this study at least - laboratory rats did not use \ncontextual cues to aid short-term social recognition. This contrasts with the results of \nresearch on other species (e.g. birds: Falls & Brooks 1975; marmosets: Snowdon & \nCleveland 1979; fish: Waas & Colgan 1994)) that do appear to use contextual cues as \nan aid for discriminating between individual conspecifics. It is possible that, although \nindividually distinguishable to the rats, the designs of the contexts in this study were \nnot conducive for developing contextual associations. Further manipulations of \ncontextual cues should be the target of future investigations. \n \nIn conclusion, this study confirms previous research (e.g. Hall & Channell \n1985; Hall & Honey 1989; Honey et al. 1992) in which habituation, unlike other types \nof learning, does not appear to show context specificity \u2013 provided that the test \ncontext is familiar to the subject - and extends this finding to the social recognition of \n 16\nconspecific odours, as determined by observed levels of stimulus investigation. In \naddition, this validation of odour use demonstrates an alternative methodology to the \nuse of live conspecifics as stimuli, thereby avoiding the potentially confounding \neffects of behavioural interaction and aggression. \n383 \n384 \n385 \n386 \n387 \n388 \n389 \n390 \n391 \n392 \n393 \n394 \n395 \n396 \n397 \n398 \n399 \n400 \n401 \n402 \n403 \n404 \n405 \n406 \n \nReferences \n \nBarnett, S.A.
