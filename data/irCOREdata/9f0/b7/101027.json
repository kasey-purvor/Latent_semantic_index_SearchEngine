[DOI: 10.1063\/1.1827337]\nAn optical ring resonator is a versatile device that can\nthen be utilized to create many different optical devices, in-\ncluding filters,1,2 switches,3,4 and add-drop multiplexers5 for\nuse in dense wavelength division multiplexing systems. In\nhigh index media such as silicon on insulator, (SOI), most\nring resonator devices realized thus far are made using strip,\nor photonic wire waveguides.6,7 This is to allow for the small\nbend radii necessary to minimize the loss associated with\ndevices and hence to produce a large free spectral range\n(FSR). However, the use of strip waveguides makes it much\nmore difficult to control the polarization properties of the\nresultant devices. In this work we take an alternative ap-\nproach, designing optical racetrack resonators based upon rib\nwaveguides, to allow us to optimize control of the polariza-\ntion properties and therefore realize a polarization-\nindependent ring resonator. While a polarization-independent\nring resonator has been demonstrated in the low index con-\ntrast material of silicon oxynitride, our devices are fabricated\nin single-crystal SOI. The design and fabrication is discussed\nfirst, followed by presentation and discussion of experimen-\ntal results.\nIn order to design a polarization-independent ring reso-\nnator, the first step was to investigate the polarization char-\nacteristics of the rib waveguide due to its geometry. The\nBEAMPROP8 simulation package was used to determine the\ndimensions necessary to create such a device. The initial\nheight and width were set to 1.35 and 1 \u00b5m, respectively.\nThese dimensions were chosen in order to maintain as large\na device as possible (within the constraints of the rib height)\nfor ease of coupling light to the device. Using BEAMPROP, the\neffective indices of the fundamental TE and TM waveguide\nmodes were monitored as the etch depth was varied. Figure\n1(a) shows a plot of the effective index as a function of etch\ndepth for both polarizations. The etch depth at which the two\ncurves cross indicates that both TE and TM polarizations\nhave the same effective index and therefore the waveguide is\npolarization independent in terms of propagation constant.\nNext it was necessary to design a polarization-\nindependent directional coupler. Figure 1(b) shows a typical\nresult of modeling a directional coupler using BEAMPROP.\nFor the purposes of the modeling, the left arm of the coupler\nwas excited with an optical field. Figure 1(b) shows that with\npropagation distance z, light transfers from the left wave-\nguide to the right, and back again in a cyclic manner.

This, in effect, means that all of the power\nis transferred from the input waveguide to the ring wave-\nguide for whichever polarization is excited. Figure 2(a)\nshows the results of varying the separation of the waveguides\nthat form the coupler, as a function of the coupling length.\nSeveral curves are plotted, for each polarization. The dimen-\nsions of the ribs used to model the coupler were determined\nfrom the results of Fig. 1(a). If a point can be found where\nthe two different polarization curves intersect, this gives the\ncoupling length and waveguide separation necessary to de-\nfine a polarization-independent directional coupler.\nFigure 2(a) demonstrates that, for the above-mentioned\ncoupler dimensions, the TE and TM curves do not intersect.\nHowever, as can be seen from Fig. 1(b), power transfers in a\nshorter length for the TE polarization than for TM. Hence, in\nFig. 2(a), curves are also plotted for TE polarized light,\nwhere the power makes three (labeled 33) and five (labeled\n53) complete transitions between the two waveguides.\nThese two curves do intersect with the TM curve and there-\nfore define a coupler length and waveguide separation where\ntotal power transfer occurs for both polarization modes. Thus\na polarization-independent coupler can be designed.\nPolarization-independent waveguides and couplers form\nthe building blocks of a polarization-independent ring reso-\nnator. However, because of tolerances associated with device\nprocessing, a matrix of resonators was fabricated with a va-\nriety of dimensions based around the above-modeled dimen-\nsions. Several wafers with slightly differing etch depths were\nalso processed for the same reason. Figure 2(b) shows the\ndimensions of one alternative design, which departs slightly\nfrom the above-established dimensions. For example, the rib\nheight is now 1.34 \u00b5m rather than 1.35 \u00b5m. Similarly the\netch depth is 0.67 \u00b5m rather than 0.828 \u00b5m defined in Fig.\n1(a). This device was subsequently modeled and the results\nare shown in Fig. 1(b). The gray line shows that all of the\npower has transferred from the left arm to the right for both\npolarizations. Thus for a coupling length of 500 \u00b5m at 1550\nnm, this directional coupler is polarization independent.\nHence there are clearly a range of designs that retain\npolarization-independent operation, while the matrix design\napproach allows for processing variations. Because of the\nrelatively long couplers used, the ring now has a racetrack\nappearance.\nDue to the use of polarization-independent rib\nwaveguides the ring resonator design incorporated a bend\nradius of 400 \u00b5m to minimize the bend loss of these rib\nwaveguides, and was fabricated in SIMOX material from the\nIBIS Corporation.9 The initial thickness of the silicon over-\nlayer was 1.5 \u00b5m with a buried oxide thickness of 0.375 \u00b5m.\nA hard mask was grown on the wafer to facilitate the etch\nprocess. The hard mask consumed approximately 150 nm of\nthe initial overlayer thickness so that the final waveguide\nheights are nominally 1.35 \u00b5m. After etching, the devices\nwere covered with a passivating surface oxide. This was car-\nried out to provide some protection to the waveguides during\nend facet preparation.\nThe wafers were then diced and the end facets polished.\nThe end facets of each die were antireflection coated in order\nto minimize Fresnel reflections and to reduce Fabry\u2013Perot\nresonance inside the device.\nPolarization-dependent coupling loss at the input\/output\nfacets was removed from the resultant measurements by nor-\nmalizing the data for each polarization scan to that for an\nidentical scan of a straight waveguide.

Figure 3(a) shows that at 1576.241,\n1576.433, and 1576.624 nm the resonant minima in both the\nTE and TM spectral scans align to within 1 pm. Hence the\ndevice is polarization independent for these wavelengths.\nThe dip at 1576.815 nm had a deviation between the TE and\nTM minima of 2 pm. The FSR was measured to be 191 and\n193 pm for TE and TM polarizations, respectively. The ex-\ntinction ratio was measured to be approximately 12.1 dB for\nTE and 11.7 dB for TM at 1576.624 nm. A close-up of the\nresonance dip at 1576.624 nm is shown in Fig. 3(b) and was\nused to measure the finesse sFd of the resonator. The finesse\nwas calculated to be 11.9 for TM and 12.1 for TE. This\nmeans that the characteristics are almost identical for TE and\nTM polarizations. Over a range of four times the FSR, the\ndips align to within 2 pm. This very slight misalignment is\ndue to the small difference in the propagation constants of\nthe TE and TM modes. For switching and modulation appli-\ncations that may typically be single wavelength based appli-\ncations, this amounts to polarization independence to a very\nhigh specification.\nWe have fabricated and measured racetrack resonator on\nSOI that is polarization independent to within 2 pm over a\nspectral range of four times the FSR. This represents a sig-\nnificant improvement in the state of the art. The FSR was\nmeasured to be approximately 192 pm with a finesse of 12\nand a Q factor of 90 000. This demonstrates that a single\nmode polarization independent laterally coupled racetrack\nresonator is feasible in SOI, using rib waveguides. Further-\nmore, this approach could be used on smaller devices that\nrequire a larger FSR.\nThe authors would like to thank Andrew Alduino and\nJeffery S.
