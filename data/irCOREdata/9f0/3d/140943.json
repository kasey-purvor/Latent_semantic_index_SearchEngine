The\nresearch is aimed at the design of control laws for the aircraft rolling by actively operating a pair of an\nunconventional hingeless flexible leading and trailing control surfaces at different flight speed. The main\nchallenge is how to achieve a specified rolling rate for the aircraft when the control effectiveness drops down and\neven crosses over the rolling reversal point within the flight envelope. This phenomenon is mainly due to the\naeroelastic effect of the large sweptback and highly flexible wing design for weight saving. The investigation\nshows that control laws varying with the flight speed can be designed to achieve the rolling control target.\nKeywords: seamless aeroelastic wing; SAW; active rolling control; PID control; optimal control law.\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n"}
