This paper examines the issue of school choice through the lens of the English \nmarket-oriented reforms; it focuses on the quasi-regulation and regulation of admissions to publicly-\nfunded secondary schools.  It examines admissions to state-maintained secondary schools in London in \nterms of the criteria and practices used in the event of there being more applicants than places available.  \nIt also explores changes in admissions criteria and practices between 2001 and 2005 given the \nlegislative and policy changes introduced in the intervening period.  Principal-agent theory is used \nheuristically to explain the differing responses of schools with responsibility for admissions and local \nauthorities to the legislative and policy framework.  It is argued that while local authorities act broadly \nin line with government guidance and regulations as the agent of the government, schools acting as \nagents do not necessarily do so and more appear to select particular groups of children as opposed to \nothers.  This, it is argued, is because the regulatory mechanisms have been insufficient to motivate them \nto act as intended in relation to their admissions policies and practices in the light of the other policy \ngoals and incentives accompanying the market-oriented reforms. \nIntroduction \nMarket-oriented reforms and school choice policies have had a high political profile in a number of \ndeveloped countries.  Writing in relation to the United States, Chubb and Moe (1990) have argued that \neach pupil should be \u2018free to attend any public school in the state\u2026\u2019 (p. 222), but that schools should be \nable to make their own decisions about who should be admitted and that they should be \u2018free to admit \nas many or as few students as they want, based on whatever criteria they think relevant \u2013 intelligence, \ninterest, motivation, behaviour, special needs \u2013 and they must be free to exercise their own, informal \njudgments about individual applicants\u2019 (p. 222).  In short, pupils\u2019 parents can apply to any public \nschools, but the school is the ultimate decision maker.  This model, however, poses problems if parental \nchoice is an intended objective of the market-oriented reforms as individual schools are likely to want \nto ensure that pupils attending the school are those the school wishes to teach (see Ladd and Fiske, \n2001).  \n \n  \nThis paper examines the issue of school choice through the lens of the English market-oriented reforms, \nby focusing on the quasi-regulation and regulation of admissions to publicly-funded, state-maintained  \nsecondary schools. Both these issues have a key role to play as a result of the reforms that were \nintroduced by Conservative governments between 1979 and 1997 and have been continued by Labour \ngovernments since.  The reforms implemented in the 1980s by Conservative administrations resulted in \nthe introduction of market principles into the state-maintained school system.  A combination of \nincreased parental \u2018choice\u2019, a greater diversity of schools (with schools being able to become \u2018grant \nmaintained\u2019 and funded by central government), per capita (formula) funding and national examination \nand test \u2018league tables\u2019 led to the development of a \u2018quasi-market\u2019 in school-based education (Le Grand \nand Bartlett, 1993).  The structures set in place provide strong incentives for schools to maximise their \nlevels of funding and maximise their outputs as measured by test and examination results. \n \nA key focus of the reforms was on school autonomy, including control over which pupils are admitted \nto schools.  However, it is important to bear in mind that school autonomy in relation to admissions was \nnot new.  Indeed, certain schools have long had responsibility for admissions; these are \u2018voluntary- \naided\u2019 schools, in the main Church of England and Roman Catholic.  Only a small percentage of \nsecondary schools were (and are) \u2018voluntary aided\u2019 (around 15 per cent).  However, following the \nEducation Reform Act 1988, autonomy over admissions was extended to schools that opted out of local \nauthority control to become grant-maintained: currently, around a third of secondary schools in England \nhave responsibility for admissions. \n \nIn England, parents make \u2018preferences\u2019 for the schools they wish their child to attend.  If there are more \napplicants than places, the decision as to whether or not a pupil is offered a place is taken by the \n\u2018admission authority\u2019 \u2013 either the local authority (in the case of community and voluntary-controlled \nschools), or the school in the case of schools that control their own admissions (voluntary-aided and \nfoundation schools).  In the former case, the local authority makes an \u2018administrative\u2019 decision \nallocating (or assigning) pupils to a school on the basis of the parents\u2019 preferences and schools\u2019 \npublished admissions criteria.  In the latter case, the school \u2018chooses\u2019 which pupils should be admitted; \nthis too should be an \u2018administrative\u2019 decision based on parents\u2019 preferences and the school\u2019s \nadmissions criteria. \n \nFor the majority of schools (community and voluntary-controlled) the local authority is responsible for \nsetting the admissions criteria and making the decision about which school the child attends, based on \nparents\u2019 expressed preferences and the criteria for the school in question.  However, in the case of \n  \nvoluntary-aided (mostly religious) schools and those that were formerly grant-maintained (now in the \nmain foundation) the school itself is responsible for its own admissions. \n \nBodies responsible for admissions to schools are known as \u2018admission authorities\u2019 and comprise local \nauthorities, voluntary-aided and foundation schools; these are required to admit children, on demand, up \nto the physical capacity of the school (except in the case of fully academic selective schools).  In the \nevent of the school being oversubscribed, with more applicants than places, the school\u2019s admissions \ncriteria are used to decide who should be offered a place.   \n \nThis paper focuses on admissions to state-maintained secondary schools in London.1  It explores two \nmain issues.  First, it examines the criteria and practices used in the event of there being more \napplicants than there are places available at a school, and in so doing explores the variation between \nschools with responsibility for their own admissions and those where admissions are controlled by the \nlocal authority.  Second, the paper examines changes in admissions criteria and practices between 2001 \nand 2005; in the intervening period a variety of legislative and policy changes were introduced.  \nPrincipal-agent theory is used heuristically in an attempt to explain the differing responses of schools \nand local authorities to the legislative and policy framework.  It is argued that while the local authority \nacts broadly as intended as the agent of the government, schools acting as agents do not necessarily do \nso \u2013 at least not in relation to school admissions.  This, it is argued, is because the regulatory \nmechanisms have been insufficient to motivate them to act as intended in the light of the other \ngovernment policy goals and the incentives accompanying the market-oriented reforms. \n \nThe next section presents an outline of the legislative framework for school admissions in England; this \nis followed by an examination of the differing principal-agent relationships in the context of the \nadmissions system.  The research study and findings are then presented.  Policy responses and a \ndiscussion of the key themes conclude the paper. \nLegislation, guidance and secondary school admissions \nConcerns about admissions to secondary schools led the Labour government, elected in 1997, to \naddress these in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.  The Act established a new legal \nframework for school admissions.  A key mechanism introduced was a Code of Practice on School \nAdmissions.  In addition, each local education authority was required to establish an Admissions Forum \nproviding for admission authorities and other interested parties (such as church representatives, local \nauthority representatives and parent governor representatives) to: \n \n  \ndiscuss the effectiveness of local admission arrangements, seek agreements on how to deal with \ndifficult admission issues and advise admission authorities on ways in which their arrangements \ncan be improved.  Admission authorities...must have regard to any advice given by the forum \nfor their area (Department for Education and Skills (DfES), 2003, para. 5.1). \n \nAnother mechanism was the appointment of Schools Adjudicators who have a specific role in seeking \nto settle local disputes concerning admissions policies and oversubscription criteria where it has not \nbeen possible to reach local agreement.  These are independent of government and decisions they make \nare binding on all the parties involved and can only be challenged through judicial review.  Disputes \nabout admissions criteria relating to religious issues are taken by the Secretary of State for Education \nand Skills (the most senior government minister), not by Adjudicators (Department for Education and \nEmployment (DfEE), 1999; DfES, 2003). \n \nThe legislation, accompanying regulations, Codes of Practice, Admissions Forums and Schools \nAdjudicator can be seen as an attempt to deal with the difficulties that had arisen from the establishment \nof a predominantly unregulated system of school admissions.   \n \nPolicy and practice have evolved since 1997.  In terms of the process of admission to secondary school, \nparents\/carers must be allowed to express a minimum of three \u2018choices\u2019, or more accurately \n\u2018preferences\u2019 for publicly-funded schools for their child, generally at the age of 11 years, when they \nmove from primary to secondary school (see DfES, 2007).  Parents complete an application form \nprovided by their local authority; for some schools, with responsibility for their own admissions, a \nsupplementary information form must also be completed.  If there are fewer applicants than places \navailable at a particular school, all those expressing a preference are offered a place for their child.2  \nHowever, if there are more applicants than places available, the school\u2019s published oversubscription \n(admissions) criteria and practices are used to determine which applicants are offered a place.   \n \nMore generally, since 1988, there have been policy shifts in England.  A quasi-market remains in \noperation, although there have been changes to the system of resource allocation, both from central to \nlocal government and from local authorities to schools (see Author).  A high policy profile is still given \nto test and examination results and to \u2018league tables\u2019.  Indeed, a key policy goal is that within five years \nno secondary school should have fewer than 30 per cent of pupils achieving five or more General \nCertificate of Secondary Education (GCSE)3 passes at grades A* to C (Department for Children, \nSchools and Families (DCSF), 2007).  Whilst the focus on examination performance remains, there is \nalso a goal to reduce the achievement gap between children from low income families and their peers \n  \nand another to promote community cohesion and a cohesive society.  These policy goals appear to be \nsomewhat contradictory.  Schools competing with one another is a goal likely to encourage \nindividualistic, self-interested behaviour by schools, with the aim of schools maximising their league \ntable position; such behaviour could include schools \u2018selecting in\u2019 some pupils and \u2018selecting out\u2019 \nothers.  The focus on social justice issues such as reducing the achievement gap may not sit easily with \nthis goal, particularly in light of the negative consequences of segregated school systems on overall \nacademic achievement as exemplified by the results of the Programme for International Student \nAssessment (OECD, 2001).  Finally, the government focus on community cohesion, appears to be \nsteering schools to work in a more collective way with the broader goal of fostering positive relations \nbetween different communities.   \n \nWe now turn to a  more detailed examination of the Codes of Practice on School Admissions and the \nrole of the Schools Adjudicator between 1997 and 2006. \nCodes of Practice on School Admissions \nIn this section we focus on key elements of the two Codes of Practice.  Whilst admission authorities \nmust comply with the law, legislation and statutory instruments, until 2007 they were only required to \n\u2018have regard to\u2019 the guidance given in the Code; having done so, they were able to set admissions \ncriteria that did not comply with the Code, as long as they had good reasons for their actions (House of \nCommons Education and Skills Committee, 2004).   \n \nOur focus is on certain aspects of the Codes, concerned in broad terms with facilitating or otherwise \nequality of access, namely the general guidance about oversubscription criteria; social justice issues; \nselection by aptitude and ability; and interviews. \nEstablishing oversubscription criteria  \nThe first Code of Practice came into force on 1 April 1999 (DfEE, 1999) and applied to arrangements \nleading to admissions from September 2000.  In terms of the criteria to be used by admission authorities \nin cases where more parents had expressed a preference for a particular school than places were \navailable, the Code noted that a admissions authorities had \u2018a fairly wide discretion to determine their \nown oversubscription criteria provided  these criteria are objective, fair, compatible with admissions \nand equal opportunities legislation\u2026\u2019 (1999, para. 5.2).  It also gave some frequently used criteria \nconsidered to be acceptable including \u2018sibling links, distance from the school, ease of access by public \ntransport, medical or social grounds, catchment areas and transfer from named feeder schools, as well \nas parents\u2019 ranking of preference.\u2019 (para. 5.3).  The general guidance was broadly similar in the second \nCode. \n  \nThe admission authority has a fairly wide discretion in deciding what these [oversubscription \ncriteria] should be, provided that: \n\u2022 the criteria are not unlawful; \n\u2022 the admission authority has properly considered the factors which it believes to be most \nimportant in ensuring that children receive an efficient and suitable education, and has had \nregard to the guidance in this Code; \n\u2022 the criteria are clear, fair and objective and are published (DfES, 2003, para. A.51). \nSocial justice issues \nEquality of opportunity \nThe first Code of Practice (DfEE, 1999) made specific reference to equal opportunities issues, noting \nthat in light of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976 \u2018admission authorities \nshould consider the possible impact, direct or indirect, on equal opportunities of their proposed \noversubscription criteria\u2019 (para 5.7) and stating that: \n  \ncriteria which give preference to children whose parents had attended the school or followed \nparticular occupations could disproportionately disadvantage ethnic minority, Traveller or \nrefugee families who have more recently moved into the area\u2026And it would not generally be \ngood practice for admission authorities to set or seek to apply oversubscription criteria which \nhad the effect of disadvantaging certain social groups in the local community\u2026Examples would \nbe explicit or implicit discrimination on the basis of parental occupation, employment, income \nrange, standard of living or home facilities (para. 5.7) \n \nThe second Code of Practice (DfES, 2003) reiterated these points and also added in some additional \ncriteria that could impact on equal opportunities.  It also noted that criteria such as giving \u2018preference to \nchildren or older siblings who had previously attended the school, or whose parents followed particular \noccupations, such as teachers, could disproportionately (even if unintentionally)\u2019 disadvantage certain \nindividuals who have recently moved into the area, noting that: \u2018Such criteria have been determined by \nthe Schools Adjudicator not to be in the interests of all local children and have been ruled out when \nsubject to an objection\u2019 (DfES, 2003, para. 3.12). \nLooked after children \nThe second Code of Practice (DfES, 2003) made explicit reference to \u2018looked after\u2019 children, a \nparticularly disadvantaged group.  A looked after child is one who is in the care of a local authority or \n  \nprovided with accommodation by that authority.  The Code recommended that admission authorities \ngive looked after children \u2018top priority\u2019 in their oversubscription criteria (para. 7.22). \nSpecial educational needs \nBoth Codes addressed the situation relating to children with special educational needs; the two Codes  \ndid not differ substantively: \n \nChildren with statements of special educational needs that name a school in the statement are \nrequired to be admitted to the school that is named.  The governing body\u2026does not have the \nright to refuse admission.  It is good practice for LEAs [local education authorities] to mention \nthis in their composite prospectuses, so that parents of other children are aware (DfES, 2003, \npara. 7.20).   \n \nIt is important to note that the admission of children with statements of special educational needs is \ncarried out differently from the admission of other pupils; in the case where there is a statement (which \ncarries with it additional resources) the school decides outside the normal admission round if it can \nmeet the needs of the pupil concerned.  Where special educational needs is mentioned in admissions \nbrochures it is usually with reference to children with statements of special educational needs. \nCommunity cohesion \nThe second Code of Practice stated that faith schools can make a contribution \u2018to community cohesion \nby having admission arrangements that are inclusive of other faiths and of all elements of population of \ntheir local area\u2019 (DfES, 2003, para. 3.10). \nSelection by aptitude and ability \nThe Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998 ruled out the introduction of any new selection on the \nbasis of academic ability; however, existing selection by ability or aptitude was allowed to continue if \nin place at the beginning of the school year 1997\/98.  New selection on the basis of aptitude in a \nprescribed subject was (and still is) also allowed in limited circumstances where the school has a \nspecialism and where the proportion selected is no more than 10 per cent of the school\u2019s intake.  \n \nIn the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 \u2018ability\u2019 is defined as \u2018either general ability or ability \nin any particular subject or subjects\u2019 (section 99).  Aptitude is not defined, although both Codes state \u2018a \npupil with aptitude is one who is identified as being able to benefit from teaching in a specific subject \nor who demonstrates a particular capacity to succeed in that subject\u2019 (DfEE, 1999, para. 5.15; DfES, \n2003, para. 7.11)  However, it is not clear how demonstrating a \u2018capacity to succeed\u2019 differs from \n  \n\u2018ability\u2019, hence previous research has focused on either aptitude or ability in a particular subject area in \nrelation to partial selection (Author). \nInterviews \nThe first Code of Practice (DfEE, 1999) allowed parents to be interviewed by church schools to \u2018assess \nreligious or denominational commitment\u2019 (para. 5.25).  Parents were not, according to the Code, to be \ninterviewed for any other purpose at any part of the application or admissions process for day schools.4  \nThe second Code (DfES, 2003) restricted interviews further, stating: \u2018for the admission round leading to \nSeptember 2005 intakes and subsequent admissions, no parents or children should be interviewed as \nany part of the application or admission process\u2019 to day schools (para. 3.16).  \nThe Schools Adjudicator \nThe Schools Adjudicator intervenes in the admissions process where it has not been possible to reach \nlocal agreement on admissions (Author).  The number of objections to admission arrangements of all \nkinds have shown an upward trend since 2001\/02, increasing from 31 to 245 in 2005\/06 (Office of the \nSchools Adjudicator, 2006).  The objections have varied, but amongst those most frequently made over \nthe period in question, were schools not giving priority to looked after children, giving priority to the \nchildren of staff or siblings of former pupils and objections to partial selection by aptitude.  The Annual \nReport for 2002\/03 (Office of the Schools Adjudicator, 2003) noted: \u2018It would appear that many \nadmission authorities have not yet fully taken account of the new Code\u2019 (2003, p. 1).  However, by \n2006, it was noted: \n \nIt is evident that many local authorities and admission forums are now reviewing admission \narrangements of all schools in their areas and objecting to those arrangements that seem to them \nto offend against the Code of Practice.  This is to be commended (Office of Schools \nAdjudicator, 2006, p. 1). \n \nA total of ten judicial reviews of determinations made by the Schools Adjudicator were made between \n2000 and 2006 (Office of the Schools Adjudicator, 2007).  The most significant was an objection made \nto the Schools Adjudicator about the use of interviews in one voluntary-aided school.  Following an \ninvestigation, the Adjudicator directed the school in question not to interview prospective pupils and \nparents (Office of the Schools Adjudicator, 2004a).  \n \nHowever, the school governors successfully challenged the decision in December 2004.  At the judicial \nreview it was argued that the school had \u2018had regard\u2019 to the Code (as required) but then decided not to \nadhere to the guidance. The school governing body commented that had the government intended to \n  \nban interviewing it would have done so through primary or secondary legislation not via quasi-\nregulatory guidance (see Office of the Schools Adjudicator, 2004b).  This is a particularly important \npoint in terms of the extent that quasi-regulation can meet the desired objectives of government and one \nto which we will return.  \nDiffering relationships between principal and agent \nOne way of examining the relationship between central government, local authorities and schools is to \nuse a principal-agent framework.  Using such an approach, we can conceive of the principal as an \ninstitution with particular objectives, with agents being needed to implement activities to achieve these \nobjectives.  However, the agents, although they may share some of the principal\u2019s objectives \u2018also have \nother (usually self-regarding) interests, such as increasing their own income\u2026Agents also have more \ninformation about what they are doing than does the principal, giving them an advantage which could \nallow them to pursue their own interests\u2019 (Bossert, 1998, p. 1516). \n \nMore explicitly in the context of publicly-funded education in the USA, Ferris (1992) proposes that: \n \nPublic education can be viewed as a series of principal-agent relationships.  The primary \nresponsibility for education in the American federal system rests with the states.  Citizens as \nprincipals enter into contracts with their state governments to deliver educational services.  Yet \nthe states have traditionally delegated much of public education policy to local school districts.  \nThus, the state-school district relationship can be viewed as a second principal-agent \nrelationship.  Within the school district, the school board delegates authority to the central \ndistrict staff to implement its decisions, providing another principal-agent relationship (Ferris, \n1992, p. 334) \n \nThe principal-agent approach provides a useful heuristic for examining school admissions.  In England, \nthe primary responsibility for education rests with central government, but historically the government \nhas delegated responsibility for delivery to local authorities.  With the education reforms that took place \nin the 1980s, the power of local authorities was reduced and more responsibility passed to individual \nschools, particularly those that opted out of local authority control.  An important aspect when there is \ndecentralization from local authorities or central government to schools is that there are \u2018mechanisms, \nsuch as incentives and regulations to ensure that the school acts responsibly in its delegated role\u2019 \n(Ferris, 1992, p. 333). \n \n  \nA major concern with principal-agent relationships, is that an agency problem may arise if the principal \nand agent have different objectives and the principal does not have sufficient information to evaluate \nthe performance of the agent.  Thus, if the objectives of the agent are different, the agent has an \ninformational advantage and a principal-agent (agency) problem exists (Ferris, 1992). \n \nIn the case of school admissions in the English context, the policy context is such that there may well be \ndifferent objectives for individual schools and for local authorities.  Using a principal-agent framework, \ncentral government can be viewed as the principal.  There are two agents: the local authority is the \nagent with respect to community and voluntary-controlled schools as it is responsible for the allocation \nof pupils to these schools.  Local authorities are likely to perceive themselves as the agent of \ngovernment given the very clear structures in which they operate vis-\u00e0-vis central government, and the \nextensive regulatory framework that guides their activities.  \n \nThe local authority is not, however, the agent for schools that have responsibility for admissions \n(voluntary-aided and foundation): in this case the individual school is the agent.  Such  schools may not \nnecessarily see themselves in this way.  Voluntary-aided schools may, for example, see themselves as \nagents for the church as opposed to the government.  Nevertheless, given the regulatory framework in \nwhich they too operate and the fact that virtually all of their resources are from central government  \n(except for 10% of capital costs in the case of voluntary-aided schools), it is not unreasonable to argue \nthat schools with autonomy over admissions are also agents of government in respect of the admissions \nprocess. \n \nAs the incentives for local authorities and individual schools vary, the consequences in terms of how \nthey respond to legislation and to guidance (quasi-regulation) are likely to vary.  The motives of \nindividual schools are likely to be determined by the fact that they, like other schools, are funded on a \npredominantly per capita basis, but they have opportunities to select who is admitted.  In a competitive \nenvironment, schools that have the opportunity to do so, may seek to admit higher attaining pupils in \norder to maximize their examination league table position.  Given the strong links between prior \nattainment and later attainment the incentive, we hypothesize, is to admit pupils who are high attainers \nprior to admission to secondary school. \n \nHowever, information on prior attainment is not likely to be available to individual schools, so given \nthe well-established links between socio-economic status and attainment, we can hypothesize that \nschools will seek to select pupils who come from supportive homes, where parents are from higher \n  \nsocio-economic groups (this is likely to be a proxy for attainment); evidence supports the selective \nnature of schools that are responsible for their own admissions (Author). \n \nIf this hypothesis is correct we might expect to see different types of admissions criteria and practices \nused by schools with responsibility for admissions from those where responsibility rests with the local \nauthority, run by a democratically elected council.  The latter are likely to be motivated to act in \naccordance with government regulations and guidance and so avoid negative sanctions when inspected \nfor the quality of provision by the relevant regulatory body.  We might also expect to see variation in \nthe extent to which schools whose admissions are controlled by different bodies respond as the \nlegislative context changes. \nResearch study and analysis  \nResearch questions \nThe research reported here focuses on the admissions criteria and practices used for admission to \nsecondary schools in London for 2001 and 2005.  There were two key objectives: \n \n\u2022 to investigate the admissions criteria\/practices used by state-maintained (public) secondary schools \nin London in 2005, including mechanisms used by schools with responsibility for admissions to \nobtain additional information about applicants; \n\u2022 to make comparisons between admissions criteria and practices in 2001 and 2005, in light of new \nguidance on the admissions process.   \n \nA focus on London is of particular interest in this context, not only because of its size, but also because \nit is diverse \u2013 it has high levels of disadvantage within the maintained school sector, especially in inner \nLondon.  A government report focusing on London secondary schools, noted that at school level there \nis \u2018tremendous variation between the prior attainment of the pupils they take in.  This variation is \nassociated with levels of deprivation and produces a steep hierarchy of schools\u2019 (DfES, 2005, p. 9; see \nalso Author).  Moreover, research indicates that fewer parents in London gain their first choice school \nthan in England as a whole (72% versus 85%) (Coldron et al., 2008; see also Flatley et al., 2001). \n \nWhilst it might be argued that London is atypical of England, the secondary school quasi-market in \nLondon is highly developed insofar as it is diverse with ostensibly considerable \u2018choice\u2019 for parents.  \nThere is school diversity, in line with government policy rhetoric, but along with diversity, in the \nEnglish context, is school autonomy over admissions.  The role of schools in deciding their own \n  \nadmissions criteria and administering and allocating places to prospective pupils is hypothesised to be a \nkey causal factor \u2013 albeit one of several \u2013 in maintaining a segregated secondary school system. \n \nMethods  \nThe research involved obtaining information on the presence or absence of individual admissions \ncriteria and practices used by each state-maintained secondary school in London, for pupils entering in \nyear 7 (age 11) in September 2001 and September 2005.  For admissions in 2001, data were obtained \nfrom information provided by the 32 local authorities in London with state-maintained secondary \nschools and from individual schools with responsibility for admissions (voluntary-aided and \nfoundation) where information was not provided in local authority brochures.  Information on a total of \n382 out of 387 secondary schools in London officially classified as \u2018comprehensive\u2019 was used for the \nanalysis.5  The schools for which no information was available were foundation\/voluntary-aided \nschools that were not included in local authority brochures and did not provide admissions information \nwhen contacted by the research team (Author).   \n \nData on admissions criteria and practices for state-maintained secondary schools for September 2005 \nwere obtained from information provided by the 32 local authorities in London with state-maintained \nsecondary schools; although local authorities had, at this time, a statutory responsibility to publish \nthese, in some cases inadequate information was provided about schools responsible for their own \nadmissions (voluntary-aided and foundation) so individual schools were contacted directly.  A \ncombined database, consisting of the admissions criteria and practices of the 362 state-maintained \nsecondary schools in London for which admissions data were available for both 2001 and 2005 was set \nup.   \n \nThe study relating to admissions in 2005 also involved contacting all secondary schools responsible for \ntheir own admissions and asking them to send a copy of any supplementary information form parents \nwere asked to complete.  Altogether forms were obtained for 41 schools, just under a quarter of the total \nnumber of secondary schools with responsibility for admissions in London in 2005 (N=173).  No \ninformation is available on how many schools with responsibility for their own admissions require an \nadditional form to be completed. \nResults \nThe results section is sub-divided into admissions criteria\/practices used in 2005 and opportunities for \nselection; and a comparison of admissions criteria\/practices used in 2001and 2005. \n  \nAdmissions criteria\/practices in 2005  \nOur analysis of the criteria and practices used revealed differences between schools of different types as \nshown in Table 1.   \n \nTable 1 about here \n \nAs shown in Table 1, high percentages of all schools gave priority to pupils with a sibling at the school,  \nproximity to the school, children in care and those with medical or social needs.  Priority criteria were \ndetermined in different ways: for children in care, some local authority application forms asked for a \nletter of confirmation from the social worker;6 for medical\/social needs, professional evidence was \ngenerally required.  Fewer schools reported giving priority to children with special educational needs; \nhowever, as noted above these data need to be treated with caution as the admissions process in relation \nto children with higher levels of special educational needs differs from that of those without such needs. \n \nOf these relatively frequently occurring criteria, there were nevertheless statistically significant \ndifferences between schools, with fewer voluntary-aided schools giving priority to each of these, and in \nsome cases fewer foundation schools (both these types of schools have control over admissions).  \nReligious criteria were only used by voluntary-aided schools (not all voluntary-aided schools have a \nreligious character so not all use these). \n \nCertain criteria were used more frequently by schools with control over their admissions than those \nwithout, namely: the pupil having ability\/aptitude in subject area, having high general ability, being the \nchild of a former pupil, having a strong family connection to the school, pastoral or compassionate \nfactors, the child\u2019s primary school record and interviews\/pre-admission meetings with pupil\/parent. \nHowever, the criterion giving priority to the children of school employees was used by similar \nproportions of schools of different types. \n \nA separate analysis of the supplementary information forms used by schools responsible for their own \nadmissions showed that these offered schools additional opportunities to \u2018select out\u2019 or \u2018select in\u2019 \nparticular pupils.7  One of the most significant findings was that the supplementary information forms \ntended to be long \u2013 just over  two-fifths of the forms (18) were four or more pages in length.  For a \nsimilar proportion (17 forms), the forms allowed four centimetres or more for parents\/carers to give \nreasons why they wanted their child to attend the school and\/or why they were applying to a Catholic \nschool and\/or to support their application.8  Allowing this amount of space would enable schools, if \n  \nthey so wanted, to ascertain parents\u2019\/carers\u2019 English proficiency and to make judgements about their \nlevel of education, which could, in theory, disadvantage some groups of parents.   \n \nSupplementary information forms asked for different types of information.  Of the 41 forms that were \navailable, 37 were for admission to voluntary-aided schools and four for admission to a foundation \nschool.  Virtually all of the religious schools asked for a reference form the vicar\/religious leader of the \nplace of worship attended.  However, in addition to information related to religion, a variety of other \ntypes of information was sought as shown in Table 2. \n \nTable 2 about here \n \nTwelve schools (just under three out of ten) asked for details of the schools attended\/occupation of all \nor older siblings.9  Ten schools (around a quarter) asked for the names of other secondary schools \napplied to. Six schools (just over one in ten) requested details of parents\u2019 country of origin or whether \nthe child had English as an additional language.  Other information, unrelated to admissions criteria was \nsought by a small number of schools: two schools asked for information about parents\u2019 occupations; \nand the same number of schools asked for information about the child\u2019s hobbies; one school sought \ninformation as to whether the child was eligible for free school meals and on whether the family lived \nin temporary housing. \n \nA minority of schools in their supplementary information forms thus requested information that had no \napparent bearing on the school\u2019s admissions criteria.  Some of the information could be seen to enable \nschools to select in or out certain pupils (e.g., the information relating to the pupil having English as an \nadditional language, being eligible for free school meals or details of the parents\u2019 occupation). \nAdmissions criteria and practices in 2005 and in 2001 \nWe also examined the changes that had taken place in terms of admissions criteria and practices used in \n2005 compared with 2001, given the changes that had taken place with a revised Code of Practice on \nSchool Admissions (DfES, 2003) and the increased number of objections made to the Schools \nAdjudicator. \n \nAs shown in Table 3, similar percentages of schools used the majority of criteria in both 2001 and 2005.  \nHowever, there were some clear differences.  In particular, many more schools gave priority to children \nin care in 2005.  More schools also gave priority to the pupil having aptitude\/ability in a subject area.  \n  \nHowever, fewer schools prioritised the pupil being the child of a school employee\/former pupil, or \nhaving a strong family connection to the school.   \n \nWhat is particularly interesting, however, is the variation between different school types in terms of \ncriteria\/practices used.  In community and voluntary-controlled schools, where admissions are \ncontrolled by the local authority, the proportion of schools giving priority to children in care increased \nfrom 4 per cent to 95 per cent.  And the percentage of schools giving priority to pupils whose parent \nwas an employee of the school decreased from 13 per cent to 5 per cent (see Table A1 in Annex). \n \nFor voluntary-aided schools there were more differences between the two years.   There was an increase \nin the percentage of schools giving priority to children in care (from zero in 2001 to 74 per cent in \n2005), to medical\/social needs (42 to 54 per cent) and to special educational needs (18 to 26 per cent).  \nThere was a very marked reduction in the use of interviews, which dropped from 52 per cent in 2001 to \n6 per cent in 2005.10  There was also a decrease in the proportion of schools giving priority to children \nof former pupils (14 to 4 per cent).  However, compassionate factors increased from 8 to 12 per cent.  \nThe percentage of schools giving priority to pupils with a religion other than that of the school \nconcerned increased from 32 to 48 per cent (see Table A2 in Annex).   \n \nIn foundation schools,  amongst the key changes were in the percentage of schools giving priority to \nchildren in care, which increased from 2 to 74 per cent.  More gave priority to children with special \neducational needs (16 to 27 per cent) and the proportion giving priority to pupils with aptitude\/ability in \na subject area increased from 7 to 10 per cent.  The percentage of schools giving priority to pupils \nwhose parents were school employees decreased from 26 to 10 per cent, and to pupils who were \nchildren of a former pupil from 27 per cent to 5 per cent (see Table A3 in Annex). \nPolicy responses and discussion \nIncreasing school autonomy has been seen as one of the ways of raising school achievement, and giving \nschools control over their own admissions has also been seen by proponents of school choice as an \nimportant element of these reforms (e.g., Chubb and Moe, 1990).  However, the research reported here \nhas highlighted the problematic nature of giving autonomy to schools over who is admitted to the \nschool: in short, it appears to allow \u2018school choice\u2019 as opposed to \u2018parental choice\u2019.  Notwithstanding \nthe general problems associated with allowing schools autonomy to administer their own admissions, \nthe  quasi-regulatory mechanisms introduced in England have clearly had a positive impact in terms of \nschools\u2019 published admissions criteria (we know relatively little about the actual administrative process \nundertaken). \n  \n \nHowever, it is clear that some admission authorities \u2013 in the main schools responsible for their own \nadmissions \u2013 have not altered their admissions criteria and practices in accordance with the guidance \nprovided.  To some extent this could be attributed to the guidance being non-statutory.  The government \nhas acted to try and address the concerns over schools not adhering to guidance.  Regulations \nintroduced in 2006 require admission authorities to give \u2018first priority in its oversubscription criteria to \nall relevant looked after children\u2019 (OPSI, 2006, section 3).  Subsequently, the 2006 Education and \nInspections Act introduced a new School Admissions Code (DfES, 2007) which came into force in \nFebruary 2007 and applies to admissions from September 2008.  This differs from the previous Codes \nin that there are certain provisions that are mandatory; these must be complied with and certain \npractices must not be used: failure to comply with these provisions means that the body concerned is in \nbreach of its statutory duty to act in accordance with the provisions in the Code.  Failure to comply may \nresult in an objection being made to the Schools Adjudicator or a complaint to the Secretary of State for \nEducation and Skills (DfES, 2007). \n \nIn addition, the 2006 Education and Inspections Act prohibits interviews \u2018where the interview is to be \ntaken into account\u2026in determining whether the applicant is to be admitted to the school\u2019 (part 3, \nsection 44).   This can be seen as a response to the Schools Adjudicator\u2019s determination, requiring \ninterviews at one voluntary-aided school to be discontinued, being quashed at judicial review (see \nabove) and ongoing concerns about the use of interviews.  Concerns about religious segregation and \nreligious schools, also led to the inclusion in the 2006 Education and Inspections Act of a new duty for \nschool governing bodies to \u2018promote community cohesion\u2019 (part 3, section 38) with a concomitant role \nfor  the Chief Inspector (of the Office for Standards in Education, the body with responsibility for \nschool inspection in England) to report on \u2018the contribution made by the school to community \ncohesion\u2019 (part 8, section 154).  Finally, the legislation requires local authorities to ensure fair access to \neducational opportunity (part 1, section 1). \n \nIt is undoubtedly the case that primary and secondary legislation have been introduced because the \ngovernment is seeking to ensure that its agents \u2013 local authorities and in particular schools with control \nover admissions \u2013 behave as intended in terms of their admissions policies and practices.  However, it is \npossible that individual schools, as admission authorities will seek to circumvent guidance if they feel \nthat there are opportunities to do so and the incentives are great enough: indeed some schools, instead \nof carrying out interviews held pre-admission \u2018meetings\u2019 in 2005.11  It is also interesting to note that  \nwe found that schools are becoming more responsive to guidance and are moving from covert to more \n  \novert forms of selection \u2013 with more schools selecting a proportion of pupils on the basis of aptitude in \na subject area than was the case previously. \n \nTo conclude, overall, the legislative and quasi-legislative reforms appear to be having some impact on \nschools\u2019 published admissions criteria and practices.  However, because of the different incentives and \nopportunities, including information asymmetry (i.e., more information being available to one party \nthan another) for schools of different types, some have been less responsive to government policy than \nothers.  It seems clear that where there are opportunities for schools to seek to manipulate their intake, \ngiven particular incentives, some will do so.  Whether the new regulatory framework will make a \nsignificant difference remains to be seen.  And even though published admissions criteria might be \nexpected to change in line with the new regulatory framework it is not clear whether school \ncomposition will change significantly: in London, there are fewer children known to be eligible for free \nschool meals in schools responsible for their own admissions and higher performing children are \nadmitted to them (Author).  In the event of schools not responding to this new framework as intended, \nin terms of their policies and practices, the government may seek to regulate further; it could for \nexample, require another body to take responsibility for the administration of the admissions process \n(some local authorities already act on behalf of individual schools) or by closer monitoring of policy \nand practice at the level of the individual school: with greater information being provided for the \nprincipal, opportunities for the agent to act in unintended ways are likely to be reduced.  As Besley and \nGhatak (2003) note: \n \nThe accountability structure defines the rules of the game, i.e. the chain of command and \ncontrol, and the formal authority by which each principal and agent is governed.  As in all such \nrelationships there are informational asymmetries and monitoring problems, and inducing \nagents to act according to the objectives and coordinating the activities of these various actors \nare the key issues of organizational design (p. 238). \n \nHowever, the actions of schools with responsibility for admissions are unsurprising, given differing \ngovernment policy goals.  A very high profile is given to \u2018league tables\u2019 and selective admissions \npolicies have been found to be associated with higher examination performance (Author).  Whilst the \ngovernment, as principal, wishes its agents to act as it intends in relation to admissions, schools with \nresponsibility for admissions, acting as agents, can be seen to act as government intends in relation to \nanother objective, namely their \u2018league table\u2019 position.  This overriding objective, a function of the \nmarket-oriented reforms, is likely to be hard to displace unless structures, legal instruments and \nincentives change radically. \n  \nReferences \n \nAuthor (various dates) \n \nBesley, T. and Ghatak, M.

Five or more passes at \ngrades A* to C are the normal requirement for progression to study General Certificate of Education Advanced \n(GCE A) levels, which are normally required for progression to higher education. \n4 As opposed to boarding (residential) schools. \n  \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n5 The 19 fully academically selective grammar schools, all in outer London, were excluded from the analysis \nreported here.   \n6 With reference to children in public care (\u2018looked after\u2019 children), some local authorities state that this is as \ndefined in Section 22 of the Children Act 1989 and may say that this includes foster children; one local authority \nstates that children in public care includes those living in children\u2019s homes, foster care, unaccompanied minors \nand children in other emergency provision.  \n7 We did not include schools that merely asked if parents wanted their child to be considered for a specialist place \nand asked for no additional information. \n8 The space allowed ranged up to nine-and-a-half inches. \n9 One school asked for details of all other children in the family and the primary and secondary schools attended \n(with dates); another asked for names of all of the applicant\u2019s siblings, together with the secondary school \nattended\/formerly attended; and if of primary school age, the name of the primary school.  Another school asked \nfor names of brothers\/sisters in family, age and school\/occupation. \n10 \u2018Pre-admission meetings\u2019 were also included in this category in 2005. \n11 For example: \u2018Under our Admissions Policy, you will be sent a supplementary information form, in the \nacademic year preceding the proposed year of entry, which you must complete.  This form will include a \u2018tick \nbox\u2019 to enable you to request a meeting in order to demonstrate the degree of your religious commitment and \npractice\u2019 and: \u2018Parents will be asked to complete a written statement of support and applicants will be invited to \nthe school to complete the second part of the application form\u2019 (Author). \n"}
