We consider a spatially nonautonomous discrete sine-Gordon equation with constant forcing and its\ncontinuum limit(s) to model a 0-\u03c0 Josephson junction with an applied bias current. The continuum\nlimits correspond to the strong coupling limit of the discrete system. The nonautonomous character\nis due to the presence of a discontinuity point, namely, a jump of \u03c0 in the sine-Gordon phase. The\ncontinuum model admits static solitary waves which are called \u03c0-kinks and are attached to the\ndiscontinuity point. For small forcing, there are three types of \u03c0-kinks. We show that one of the\nkinks is stable and the others are unstable. There is a critical value of the forcing beyond which\nall static \u03c0-kinks fail to exist. Up to this value, the (in)stability of the \u03c0-kinks can be established\nanalytically in the strong coupling limits. Applying a forcing above the critical value causes the\nnucleation of 2\u03c0-kinks and -antikinks. Besides a \u03c0-kink, the unforced system also admits a static\n3\u03c0-kink. This state is unstable in the continuum models. By combining analytical and numerical\nmethods in the discrete model, it is shown that the stable \u03c0-kink remains stable and that the\nunstable \u03c0-kinks cannot be stabilized by decreasing the coupling. The 3\u03c0-kink does become stable\nin the discrete model when the coupling is su\ufb03ciently weak.\nKey words. 0-\u03c0 Josephson junction, 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation, semi\ufb02uxon, \u03c0-kink\nAMS subject classi\ufb01cations. 34D35, 35Q53, 37K50, 39A11\nDOI. 10.1137\/060657984\n1. Introduction. One important application of the sine-Gordon equation is to describe\nthe propagation of magnetic \ufb02ux (\ufb02uxons) in long Josephson junctions [17, 18, 5]. The \ufb02ux\nquanta or \ufb02uxons are described by the kinks of the sine-Gordon equation. When many small\nJosephson junctions are connected through the inductance of the superconductors, they form\na discrete Josephson transmission line. The propagation of a \ufb02uxon is then described by\nthe discrete sine-Gordon equation. For some materials, Josephson junctions are more easily\nfabricated in the form of a lattice than as a long continuous Josephson junction. In the strong\ncoupling limit, a discrete Josephson junction lattice becomes a long Josephson junction.\nIt was proposed in the late 1970\u2019s by Bulaevskii that a phase-shift of \u03c0 may occur in\nthe sine-Gordon equation due to magnetic impurities [7, 8].

Present technological advances can also impose a\n\u03c0-phase-shift in a long Josephson junction using, e.g., superconductors with unconventional\npairing symmetry [34], superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SFS) \u03c0-junctions [29],\nor superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) junctions in which the charge-carrier\npopulation in the conduction channels is controlled [4].\nA junction containing a region with a phase jump of \u03c0 is then called a 0-\u03c0 Josephson\njunction and is described by a 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation. The place where the 0-junction\nmeets the \u03c0-junction is called a discontinuity point. A 0-\u03c0 Josephson junction admits a\nhalf magnetic \ufb02ux (semi\ufb02uxon), sometimes called a \u03c0-\ufb02uxon, attached to the discontinuity\npoint [13]. A semi\ufb02uxon is represented by a \u03c0-kink in the 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation [32].\nUsing the technology described in [13], a 0-\u03c0 array of Josephson junctions can be created\nas well. Such a system can be modeled by a discrete 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation. A short\nnumerical study of a discrete \u03c0-kink is given in [31].\nThe presence of the semi\ufb02uxon in a 0-\u03c0 Josephson junction or a 0-\u03c0 array of Josephson\njunctions opens a new \ufb01eld where many questions that have been discussed in detail for the\n2\u03c0-kink (\ufb02uxon) in the sine-Gordon equation can be addressed for the \u03c0-kink, too. The\nfact that the \u03c0-kink cannot move in space, even in the continuum case, will give a di\ufb00erent\nqualitative behavior such as the disappearance of the zero eigenvalue (Goldstone mode), as\nwill be shown later.\nIn this paper we will study both the continuous and discrete 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equations,\nespecially the stability of the kinks admitted by the equations. Knowing the eigenvalues of\na kink is of interest for experimentalists, since the corresponding eigenfunctions (localized\nmodes) can play an important role in the behavior of the kink [27].\nThe present work is organized as follows: in section 2 we will describe the mathematical\nmodel of the problem and its interpretation as a Josephson junction system. We will discuss\nthe discrete system as well as several continuum approximations. In section 3 we consider the\ncontinuous 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation which describes a continuous long Josephson junction\nwith discontinuity point. It is also the lowest order continuum approximation for the discrete\nsystem, not re\ufb02ecting any lattice spacing (coupling) e\ufb00ects. In [32] it is shown that there\nexist three types of \u03c0-kinks in the 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation. We will analyze their stability\nand show that one type is stable and the other two are unstable. A higher order continuum\napproximation, which includes terms representing a small lattice spacing (strong coupling), is\nconsidered in section 4. It is shown that for small values of the lattice spacing parameter, the\nthree types of \u03c0-kinks persist and their stability properties do not change. In section 5 the\ndiscrete 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon with large lattice spacing (small coupling) is analyzed, especially the\nexistence and stability of \u03c0-kinks. Numerical calculations connecting the regions of small and\nlarge lattice spacing (weak and strong coupling) will be presented in section 6. In this section\nthe analytical results of the previous sections are linked together. Conclusions and plans for\nfuture research are presented in section 7.\n2. Mathematical models for 0-\u03c0 junctions.\n2.1. The discrete 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation.

The lattice spacing parameter a\nis normalized to the Josephson length \u03bbJ , the time t is normalized to the inverse plasma\nfrequency \u03c9\u221210 , and the applied bias current density \u03b3 > 0 is scaled to the critical current\ndensity Jc.\nThe equation of the phase motion generated by the Lagrangian (2.1) is the discrete 0-\u03c0\nsine-Gordon equation\n\u03c6\u00a8n \u2212 \u03c6n\u22121 \u2212 2\u03c6n + \u03c6n+1\na2\n= \u2212 sin(\u03c6n + \u03b8n) + \u03b3.(2.3)\nWe use n \u2208 Z for the analytical calculations, but, of course, the fabrication of the junction\nas well as the numerics are limited to a \ufb01nite number of sites, say, 2N . We will take the\nboundary conditions to represent the way in which the applied magnetic \ufb01eld h = H\/(\u03bbJJc)\nenters the system, i.e.,\n\u03c6\u2212N+1 \u2212 \u03c6\u2212N\na\n=\n\u03c6N \u2212 \u03c6N\u22121\na\n= h.(2.4)\nIn what follows we will always consider the case when there is no applied magnetic \ufb01eld; i.e.,\nwe will take h = 0.\n2.2. Approximations to the lattice spacing in the continuum limit. There are various\ncontinuum model approximations for (2.3) that can be derived in the continuum limit a\u0004 1.\nWriting \u03c6n = \u03c6(na) and expanding the di\ufb00erence terms using a Taylor expansion give\n\u03c6n\u22121 \u2212 2\u03c6n + \u03c6n+1\na2\n= 2\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\na2k\n(2k + 2)!\n\u2202kxx\u03c6xx(na) = La\u03c6xx\nand\n\u03c6n+1 \u2212 \u03c6n\na\n=\n\u221e\u2211\nk=0\nak\n(k + 1)!\n\u2202kx\u03c6(na) = L\u02dca\u03c6x.\nThus the continuum approximation for (2.3) is\n\u03c6tt \u2212 La\u03c6xx = \u2212 sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8) + \u03b3,(2.5)\nwhere \u03b8(x) is de\ufb01ned similarly to (2.2), i.e.,\n\u03b8(x) =\n{\n0, x < 0,\n\u2212\u03c0, x > 0.\n102 G.

The \ufb01rst obvious approximation is\n\u03c6tt \u2212 \u03c6xx \u2212 a\n2\n12\n\u03c6xxxx = \u2212 sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8) + \u03b3, x \u0006= 0.(2.6)\nAnother approximation can be found by using that (1\u2212 a212\u2202xx)La = 1 \u2212 a\n4\n240\u2202\n2\nxx + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . This\nresult re\ufb02ects the invertibility of La up to fourth order. Hence (1 \u2212 a212\u2202xx) acting on (2.5)\ngives the approximation (up to fourth order terms)\n\u03c6xx = \u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 a\n2\n12\n\u2202xx(\u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)), x \u0006= 0.(2.7)\nExpanding this equation and using the expression for \u03c6xx again, we get\n\u03c6xx = \u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3(2.8)\n\u2212 a\n2\n12\n(\n\u03c6tttt + [sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)]tt \u2212 \u03c62x sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\n+ cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)[\u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3]\n)\n, x \u0006= 0.\nThe steady state equation for (2.6) is\n\u03c6xx +\na2\n12\n\u03c6xxxx = sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3, x \u0006= 0,\nwhile (2.7) yields the equation\n\u03c6xx =\n(\n1\u2212 a\n2\n12\n\u2202xx\n)\nsin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3, x \u0006= 0,\nand (2.8) gives\n\u03c6xx = sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 a\n2\n12\n(\u2212\u03c62x sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8) + cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)[sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3]), x \u0006= 0.\nUnfortunately the last two equations are not Hamiltonian, so we have lost the Hamiltonian\nproperties of the original system, while the \ufb01rst equation is singularly perturbed.\nYet another approximation that has a variational structure and is not singularly perturbed\ncan be obtained by combining the two equations that have lost their variational character.\nIndeed, taking (2.7) twice and subtracting (2.8) give\n\u03c6xx = \u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3(2.9)\n\u2212 a\n2\n12\n(\n2\u03c6xxtt + 2\u03c6xx cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03c62x sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03c6tttt \u2212 \u03c6tt cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\n+ \u03c62t sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)(\u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3)\n)\n, x \u0006= 0.\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 103\nThe Lagrangian for this system is\nL =\n\u222b\u222b\n1\n2\u03c6\n2\nt \u2212 12\u03c62x \u2212 1 + cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8) + \u03b3\u03c6\n+\na2\n2\n[\n\u03c6x\u2202x(\u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)) +\n1\n2\n(\u03c6tt + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3)2\n]\ndx dt.\nThe static equation for (2.9) is\n\u03c6xx = sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3(2.10)\n\u2212 a\n2\n12\n(\n2\u03c6xx cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03c62x sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)(sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3)\n)\n, x \u0006= 0.\nThis equation is a regularly perturbed Hamiltonian system with the Hamiltonian\nH(\u03c6, p) =\np2\n2(1 + a\n2\n6 cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8))\n+ \u03b3\u03c6+ cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 a\n2\n24\n(sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3)2 ,\nwhich implies p = \u03c6x\n(\n1 + a\n2 cos(\u03c6+\u03b8)\n6\n)\n.\nIn this paper, we will analyze (2.9) as a continuum strong interaction limit which incor-\nporates some e\ufb00ects of the lattice spacing into the model.

The \u03c0-kinks and their spectra in the continuum limit. In this section, we will consider\n(2.9) for a = 0, which is a model for an ideal long 0-\u03c0 Josephson junction:\n\u03c6tt \u2212 \u03c6xx + sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8) = \u03b3, x \u0006= 0.(3.1)\nFor a Josephson junction without an applied bias current or a phase jump, i.e., for \u03b3 = 0\nand \u03b8(x) \u2261 0, the model corresponds to the sine-Gordon equation. A stable solution of the\nsine-Gordon equation is the basic (normalized) stationary, monotonically increasing \ufb02uxon,\ngiven by\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(x) = 4 arctan e\nx, \u03c6\ufb02ux(0) = \u03c0(3.2)\n(see [10]).\nIn general the discontinuous function \u03b8(x) in (3.1) will introduce a discontinuity at x = 0\nfor the second derivative \u03c6xx. Hence, the natural solution space for (3.1) consists of functions\nwhich are spatially continuous and have a continuous spatial derivative. The behavior at\nin\ufb01nity is regulated by requiring that the spatial derivative of the solution belongs to H1(R)\n(which allows the phase to converge to a nonzero constant at in\ufb01nity). Therefore, (3.1) is\nconsidered as a dynamical system on the function space\nH = {\u03c6 : R \u2192 R | \u03c6x \u2208 H1(R)}.\nIt is straightforward to \ufb01nd that for |\u03b3| < 1 and x < 0, the \u201c\ufb01xed points\u201d of (3.1)\nare \u03c6\u2212s = arcsin(\u03b3) and \u03c6\u2212c = \u2212 arcsin(\u03b3) + \u03c0. Similarly, for |\u03b3| < 1 and x > 0, they\n104 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nare \u03c6+s = arcsin(\u03b3) + \u03c0 and \u03c6\n+\nc = \u2212 arcsin(\u03b3) + 2\u03c0. In [32], it is shown that there exist\nvarious types of stationary fronts, which connect the equilibria. Most stationary fronts are\nso-called \u03c0-kinks, which are static waves connecting equilibrium states at x = \u00b1\u221e with a\nphase-di\ufb00erence of \u03c0. Such waves are solutions of the static wave equation\n\u03c6xx \u2212 sin(\u03c6+ \u03b8) = \u2212\u03b3, x \u0006= 0.(3.3)\nIn the x-dynamics of (3.3), the points \u03c6\u00b1s are saddle points and the points with \u03c6\u00b1c are center\npoints. Thus a \u03c0-kink connects \u03c6\u2212s with \u03c6+s .\nIn this section we will consider the stability of those \u03c0-kinks. For completeness, we \ufb01rst\ndescribe the various types of \u03c0-kinks as found in [32]. These \u03c0-kinks are constructed by taking\nsuitable combinations of the phase portraits for \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0. The phase portraits for\n\u03b3 = 0 are essentially di\ufb00erent from the ones for 0 < \u03b3 < 1 (the case \u22121 < \u03b3 < 0 follows from\nthis one by taking \u03c6 \t\u2192 \u2212\u03c6 and \u03b3 \t\u2192 \u2212\u03b3). In case \u03b3 > 0 there are homoclinic connections at\nk\u03c0 + arcsin(\u03b3), k \u2208 Z, k even (\u03b8 = 0), or k odd (\u03b8 = \u2212\u03c0). If \u03b3 = 0, then these homoclinic\nconnections break to heteroclinic connections between k\u03c0 and (k + 2)\u03c0.\nThe phase portrait of (3.3) for \u03b3 = 0 is shown in Figure 1(a). Following the notation\nin [32], in case \u03b3 = 0, there are two types of heteroclinic connections (kinks) in the 0-\u03c0\njunction. The \ufb01rst one, called type 1 and denoted by \u03c61\u03c0(x; 0), connects 0 and \u03c0. The point\nin the phase plane where the junction lies is denoted by d1(0). The second one, called type 2\nand denoted by \u03c623\u03c0(x; 0), connects 0 and 3\u03c0. Now the point in the phase plane where the\njunction lies is denoted by d2(0). This solution is not a semi\ufb02uxon, but it will play a role in\nthe analysis of some of the semi\ufb02uxons for \u03b3 \u0006= 0.\nIf 0 < \u03b3 \u0004 1, then there are three types of \u03c0-kinks (heteroclinic connections) in the\njunction, all connecting arcsin(\u03b3) and \u03c0 + arcsin(\u03b3). A phase portrait of (3.3) for nonzero \u03b3\nis shown in Figure 1(b). The \ufb01rst semi\ufb02uxon, called type 1 and denoted by \u03c61\u03c0(x; \u03b3), is a\ncontinuation of the connection at \u03b3 = 0. The point in the phase plane where the junction lies\nis denoted by d1(\u03b3). The \u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c6\n1\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) is monotonically increasing.\nThe second one is called type 2 and is denoted by \u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3). In the limit for \u03b3 \u2192 0, it\nbreaks in the 3\u03c0-kink and the heteroclinic connection between 3\u03c0 and \u03c0 (a \u22122\u03c0-kink or an\nanti\ufb02uxon). The point in the phase plane where the junction lies is denoted by d2(\u03b3). The\n\u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3) is not monotonically increasing but has a hump.\nThe third one is called type 3 and is denoted by \u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3). In the limit for \u03b3 \u2192 0, it breaks\nin the heteroclinic connection between 0 and 2\u03c0 (\ufb02uxon) and an antisemi\ufb02uxon like the type 1\nwave but connecting 2\u03c0 and \u03c0. The point in the phase plane where the junction lies is denoted\nby d3(\u03b3). This \u03c0-\ufb02uxon has a hump, too, but a lower one than the type 2 wave. Following the\n\ufb01rst homoclinic orbit, the junction points are ordered such that d1(\u03b3) comes \ufb01rst, followed by\nd2(\u03b3), followed by d3(\u03b3) (see Figure 1(b)).\nIf \u03b3 increases, the points d2(\u03b3) and d3(\u03b3) approach each other, until they coincide at [32]\n\u03b3 = \u03b3\u2217 =\n2\u221a\n4 + \u03c02\n(3.4)\nin the point (\u03c0+arcsin(\u03b3\u2217), 0). At this point, the type 2 wave \u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3) ceases to exist (in the\nlimit it breaks into half the homoclinic connection for x < 0 and the full homoclinic connection\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 105\nd1 d2\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.

Any orbit of (3.1) switches at x = 0\nfrom bold to dashed. The type 1 semi\ufb02uxon switches at d1 and corresponds to one of the gray arrow-lines. The\n3\u03c0-\ufb02uxon switches at d2 and is denoted by the other gray arrow-line. (b) The phase portrait of system (3.3) for\n\u03b3 = 0.1. For simplicity, only the stable and unstable manifolds of the \ufb01xed points are shown. Apart from d1,\nthere are also the points d2 or d3 which can be used for the switch position of x = 0 to obtain a solution with a\nphase di\ufb00erence \u03c0 between the endpoints.\nfor x > 0). The type 3 kink \u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3\n\u2217) consists of half the homoclinic connection for x < 0 and\nthe \ufb01xed point for x > 0, and this wave can be continued for \u03b3 > \u03b3\u2217. For \u03b3 > \u03b3\u2217, the type 3\nkink is monotonic.\nIf \u03b3 increases further, the points d1(\u03b3) and d3(\u03b3) approach each other [32] until they\ncoincide at\n\u03b3 = \u03b3cr =\n2\n\u03c0\n.(3.5)\nWhen \u03b3 = \u03b3cr, the orbit homoclinic to the hyperbolic \ufb01xed point for x < 0 is tangential at\nd1(\u03b3) = d3(\u03b3) to the nonhomoclinic stable manifold of the hyperbolic \ufb01xed point for x > 0.\n106 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nAs soon as \u03b3 > \u03b3cr, there is no more intersection of the homoclinic orbit for x < 0 with a\nstable manifold of the hyperbolic \ufb01xed point for x > 0. This implies that no static \u03c0-\ufb02uxons\ncan exist. For more details, see [32].\nAfter recalling the description of the \u03c0-kinks from [32], we can start the stability analysis.\nIt will be shown that the type 1 \u03c0-kink is nonlinearly stable for all 0 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b3cr. The type 2\nand type 3 \u03c0-kinks are linearly unstable for all values of \u03b3 for which they exist. First we\nconsider the linearization about the \u03c0-kinks.\nTheorem 3.1. The linearizations about the various \u03c0-kinks have the following properties:\n(i) The eigenvalues of the linearization about the monotonic type 1 \u03c0-kink \u03c61\u03c0(x; \u03b3) are\nstrictly negative for 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < \u03b3cr. At \u03b3 = \u03b3cr, the largest eigenvalue is zero. These \u03c0-kinks are\nlinearly stable.\n(ii) The largest eigenvalue of the linearization about the type 2 \u03c0-kink \u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3) is strictly\npositive for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3\u2217. These \u03c0-kinks are linearly unstable.\n(iii) The largest eigenvalue of the linearization about the type 3 \u03c0-kink \u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3) is strictly\npositive for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3cr. These \u03c0-kinks are linearly unstable. In the limit for \u03b3 \u2192 0 and\n\u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3cr, the largest eigenvalue converges to zero.\nRemark 3.2. Note that the instability of the two nonmonotonic \u03c0-kinks cannot be estab-\nlished by the classical Sturm\u2013Liouville argument. In the classical, autonomous setting, the\nderivative of the wave about which the system is linearized is an eigenfunction of the linearized\nsystem. This eigenfunction is associated with the translation invariance of the original system\nand hence corresponds to an eigenvalue \u03bb = 0. If the wave is nonmonotonic, then its derivative\nhas a zero, which implies that \u03bb = 0 is not the largest eigenvalue [33] and that the wave must\nbe unstable. Due to the discontinuity at x = 0, our system is nonautonomous, and thus not\ninvariant with respect to translations, and \u03bb = 0 is (in general) not an eigenvalue. Thus, it\ncannot a priori be concluded that the nonmonotonic \u03c0-kinks must be unstable.\nTo prove Theorem 3.1, it will be shown that the linearization about a \u03c0-kink has an\neigenvalue of zero if and only if the \u03c0-kink takes a value which is a multiple of \u03c0 at x = 0.\nSince the value at x = 0 is related to the point di(\u03b3), it can be derived that this happens only\nat \u03b3 = \u03b3cr for the colliding type 1 and type 3 waves. To complete the proof, we will derive\nexpressions for the largest eigenvalue of the linearization about each semikink near \u03b3 = 0 in\nthree separate lemmas and use that the eigenvalues are continuous in \u03b3 to derive the sign of\nthe largest eigenvalue on the existence interval of the \u03c0-kink.\nTo linearize about a solution \u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3), write \u03c6(x, t) = \u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) + v(x, t), substitute this in\nthe model equation (3.1), and disregard all higher order terms:\n[Dxx \u2212 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x))] v = Dtt v.(3.6)\nUsing the spectral Ansatz v(x, t) = e\u03bbtv\u02dc(x), where v(x) is a continuously di\ufb00erentiable func-\ntion, and dropping the tildes, we get the eigenvalue problem\nLi(x; \u03b3) v = \u03bb2 v,(3.7)\nwhere Li is de\ufb01ned as\nLi(x; \u03b3) = Dxx \u2212 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x)).(3.8)\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 107\nThe natural domain for Li is H2(R). We call \u039b an eigenvalue of Li if there is a function\nv \u2208 H2(R), which satis\ufb01es Li(x; \u03b3) v = \u039bv. Since Li depends smoothly on \u03b3, the eigenvalues\nof Li will depend smoothly on \u03b3, too.\nThe operator Li is symmetric; hence all eigenvalues will be real. A straightforward calcula-\ntion gives that the continuous spectrum of Li is in (\u2212\u221e,\u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32). Since the eigenfunctions\nare continuously di\ufb00erentiable functions inH2(R) by the Sobolev embedding theorem, Sturm\u2019s\ntheorem [33] can be applied, leading to the fact that the eigenvalues are bounded from above.\nFurthermore, if v1 is an eigenfunction of Li with eigenvalue \u039b1 and v2 is an eigenfunction of Li\nwith eigenvalue \u039b2 with \u039b1 > \u039b2, then there is at least one zero of v2 between any pair of\nzeros of v1 (including the zeros at \u00b1\u221e). Hence if the eigenfunction v1 has a \ufb01xed sign, then\n\u039b1 is the largest eigenvalue of Li.\nThe following lemma gives a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition for Li to have an eigenvalue\n\u039b = 0.\nLemma 3.3. The eigenvalue problem\nLi(x; \u03b3)v = \u039bv, x \u2208 R,\nhas an eigenvalue \u039b = 0 if and only if one of the following two conditions holds:\n(i) Dxx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) is continuous at x = 0; i.e., \u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; \u03b3) = k\u03c0 for some k \u2208 Z;\n(ii) Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; \u03b3) = 0 and there are some x\u00b1, with sgn(x\u00b1) = \u00b11, such that Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(x\u00b1; \u03b3) \u0006=\n0.\nProof. Since \u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) converges to a saddle point for |x| \u2192 \u221e, this implies that Dx\u03c6\u03c0(x; \u03b3)\ndecays exponentially fast to 0 for |x| \u2192 \u221e. Since \u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) solves (3.3), di\ufb00erentiating this\nODE with respect to x gives\nLi(x; \u03b3)Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) = 0 for x \u0006= 0.\nThis implies that for any constantK, the function wiK(x) = KDx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) satis\ufb01es Li(x; \u03b3)wiK(x)\n= 0 for x \u0006= 0. Hence for any K\u2212 and K+, the solution\nwi(x) =\n{\nwiK\u2212(x), x < 0,\nwiK+(x), x > 0,\nsolves Li(x; \u03b3)wi(x) = 0 for x \u0006= 0. The function wi(x) is continuously di\ufb00erentiable if and\nonly if the following two conditions hold:\n1. wiK\u2212(0\u2212) = wiK+(0+); in other words, K\u2212Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3) = K+Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3), since \u03c6i\u03c0 is\ncontinuously di\ufb00erentiable;\n2. Dxw\ni\nK\u2212(0\u2212) = DxwiK+(0+); thus K\u2212Dxx\u03c6i\u03c0(0\u2212; \u03b3) = K+Dxx\u03c6i\u03c0(0+; \u03b3).\nThe \ufb01rst condition is satis\ufb01ed if K\u2212 = K+ or Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3) = 0. If Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3) = 0, we can\nchoose K\u00b1 such that the second condition is satis\ufb01ed and we do not end up with the trivial\nsolution, except when Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) is trivial for either x > 0 or x < 0.\nIf Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; \u03b3) \u0006= 0, we need Dxx\u03c6i\u03c0 to be continuous at x = 0 in order to satisfy the second\ncondition. Since Dxx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) = sin(\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x))\u2212 \u03b3, Dxx\u03c6i\u03c0 is continuous at x = 0 if and\nonly if sin(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)) = 0. These arguments prove that if one of the two conditions are satis\ufb01ed,\nthen \u039b = 0 is an eigenvalue of Li.\n108 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nNext we assume that \u039b = 0 is an eigenvalue of Li; hence there is some continuously\ndi\ufb00erentiable function vi(x) such that Li(x)vi(x) = 0 for x \u0006= 0 and vi(x) \u2192 0 for |x| \u2192 \u221e.\nThe only solutions decaying to zero at +\u221e are the solutions on the one-dimensional stable\nmanifold, and similarly, the only solutions decaying to zero at \u2212\u221e are the solutions on the one-\ndimensional unstable manifold. The stable and unstable manifolds are formed by multiples of\nDx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0. So we can conclude that there exist K\u00b1 such that\nvi(x) =\n{\nK\u2212Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(x) for x < 0,\nK+Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x) for x > 0.\nNow we are back in the same situation as above, so we can conclude that either one of the\ntwo conditions in the lemma must be satis\ufb01ed.\nThe second condition in the lemma does not occur. Indeed, the \ufb01rst part of the second\ncondition, i.e., Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; \u03b3) = 0, happens only if di has its second coordinate zero and hence\nonly at \u03b3 = \u03b3\u2217 with d2 = d3. At this point, the solution \u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3\u2217) has ceased to exist and the\nsolution \u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3\n\u2217) consists of the \ufb01xed point for x > 0. Hence this solution does not satisfy\nthe second part of the second condition.\nTo see for which value of \u03b3 the \ufb01rst condition is satis\ufb01ed, we derive the relation between\n\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3) and \u03b3. Multiplying the static equation (3.3) with Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0 and rewriting it give\nDx[(Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3))\n2] = 2Dx[\u2212\u03b3\u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3)\u2212 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x))], x \u0006= 0.\nIntegration from \u00b1\u221e to 0 and using that Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(\u00b1\u221e; \u03b3) = 0 show\n(Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; \u03b3))\n2 = 2[\u2212\u03b3(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)\u2212 \u03c6i\u03c0(\u2212\u221e; \u03b3))\u2212 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)) + cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(\u2212\u221e; \u03b3))],\n(Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; \u03b3))\n2 = 2[\u2212\u03b3(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)\u2212 \u03c6i\u03c0(+\u221e; \u03b3)) + cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3))\u2212 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(+\u221e; \u03b3))].\nSubtracting these two equations and using that \u03c6i\u03c0(+\u221e; \u03b3) = \u03c6i\u03c0(\u2212\u221e; \u03b3) + \u03c0, we get that\n0 = \u2212\u03c0\u03b3 \u2212 2 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)); hence cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)) =\n\u03c0\u03b3\n2\n.(3.9)\nThus the \ufb01rst condition is only satis\ufb01ed when cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(0; \u03b3)) = \u00b11; hence \u03b3 = 2\u03c0 = \u03b3cr.\nThe following step in the analysis of the eigenvalues of the linearization is to consider\nthe behavior of the eigenvalues for \u03b3 small. First note that at \u03b3 = 0, we have an explicit\nexpression for the \u03c0-\ufb02uxon and the 3\u03c0-\ufb02uxon (see (3.2) for the expression of \u03c6\ufb02ux):\n\u03c61\u03c0(x; 0) =\n{\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(x\u2212 ln(1 +\n\u221a\n2)) for x < 0,\n\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x\u2212 ln(1 +\n\u221a\n2)) for x > 0,\n(3.10)\n\u03c623\u03c0(x; 0) =\n{\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(x+ ln(1 +\n\u221a\n2)) for x < 0,\n3\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x+ ln(1 +\n\u221a\n2)) for x > 0.\n(3.11)\nHence the derivatives of both functions are even and cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; 0)+ \u03b8) is continuous and even,\nsince \u03c61\u03c0(0; 0) =\n\u03c0\n2 and \u03c6\n2\n3\u03c0(0; 0) =\n3\u03c0\n2 .\nFor \u03b3 \u0004 1, the homoclinic orbit in the system with \u03b8 = 0 will be crucial for the ap-\nproximation of type 2 and type 3 solutions.

For \u03b3 small, we have for the even homoclinic connection \u03c6h(x; \u03b3)\n\u03c6h(x; \u03b3) = \u03c6\ufb02ux(x+ L\u03c0(\u03b3)) + \u03b3 \u03c61(x+ L\u03c0(\u03b3)) + \u03b3\n2R2(x+ L\u03c0(\u03b3); \u03b3), x < 0,(3.12)\nwhere the expression for the 2\u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c6\ufb02ux can be found in (3.2),\n\u03c61(x) =\n1\n2\n[\n\u22121 + coshx+\n\u222b x\n0\n\u03be\ncosh \u03be\nd\u03be\n]\n1\ncoshx\n\u2212 arctan ex\n( x\ncoshx\n+ sinhx\n)\n,\nand L\u03c0(\u03b3) is such that \u03c6h(\u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3); \u03b3) = \u03c0 = \u03c6\ufb02ux(0), implying\nL\u03c0(\u03b3) =\n1\n2\n|ln \u03b3|+ ln 4\u221a\n\u03c0\n+O(\u221a\u03b3).(3.13)\nFurthermore, \u03b32R2(x + L\u03c0(\u03b3); \u03b3) = O(\u03b3), uniform for x < 0 and \u03b3\u03c61(L\u03c0(\u03b3); \u03b3) = O(\u221a\u03b3).\nThus\n\u03c6h(0) = 2\u03c0 \u2212 2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3).(3.14)\nFinally, \u03c61(x\u02dc; \u03b3) = O(1) and R2(x\u02dc; \u03b3) = O(1), uniform for x\u02dc < 0.\nProof. It is more convenient in the following perturbation analysis to follow the normal-\nization of \u03c6\ufb02ux(x); i.e., in this proof we introduce new coordinates x\u02dc = x + L\u03c0(\u03b3), where\nL\u03c0(\u03b3) is such that \u03c6h(\u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3); \u03b3) = \u03c0 = \u03c6\ufb02ux(0). In the following we will drop the tildes and\nwork in those new coordinates. As \u03c6h in the original coordinates was even, we get in the new\ncoordinates Dx\u03c6h(L\u03c0(\u03b3); \u03b3) = 0. This condition will be used later to determine an asymptotic\nexpression for L\u03c0(\u03b3).\nIn the new coordinates, we introduce the expansion\n\u03c6h(x; \u03b3) = \u03c6\ufb02ux(x) + \u03b3\u03c61(x) + \u03b3\n2R2(x; \u03b3), x < L\u03c0(\u03b3).\nBy linearizing about \u03c6\ufb02ux, it follows that the equation for \u03c61 is\nL(x)\u03c61 = \u22121, where L(x) = Dxx \u2212 cos(\u03c6\ufb02ux(x)).(3.15)\nThe operator L(x) is identical to the operator associated with the stability of \u03c6\ufb02ux(x). The\nhomogeneous problem L\u03c8 = 0 has the two independent solutions\n\u03c8b(x) =\n1\ncoshx\n, \u03c8u(x) =\nx\ncoshx\n+ sinhx,(3.16)\nwhere \u03c8b(x) =\n1\n2\nd\ndx\u03c6\ufb02ux(x) is bounded and \u03c8u(x) unbounded as x \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. By the variation-\nof-constants method, we \ufb01nd the general solution to (3.15),\n\u03c61(x;A,B) =\n[\nA+\n1\n2\ncoshx+\n1\n2\n\u222b x\n0\n\u03be\ncosh \u03be\nd\u03be\n]\n1\ncoshx\n+ [B \u2212 arctan ex]\n( x\ncoshx\n+ sinhx\n)\n,\n110 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nwith A,B \u2208 R. The solution \u03c61(x) of (3.15) must be bounded as x\u2192 \u2212\u221e and is normalized\nby \u03c61(0) = 0 (since \u03c6h(0) = \u03c6\ufb02ux(0) = \u03c0). Thus, we \ufb01nd that A = \u221212 and B = 0. Note that\nlimx\u2192\u2212\u221e \u03c61(x) = 1, which agrees with the fact that limx\u2192\u2212\u221e \u03c6h(x) = arcsin \u03b3 = \u03b3 +O(\u03b33).\nThe solution \u03c61(x) is clearly not bounded as x \u2192 \u221e, the unbounded parts of \u03c61(x) and\nd\ndx\u03c61(x) are given by\n\u03c61|u(x) = \u2212 arctan ex sinhx, d\ndx\n\u03c61|u(x) = \u2212 arctan ex coshx.(3.17)\nIt follows that \u03c61(x) = O(\u03b3\u2212\u03c3) for some \u03c3 > 0 if ex = O(\u03b3\u2212\u03c3), i.e., if x = \u03c3|ln \u03b3| at leading\norder. Using this, it is a straightforward procedure to show that the rest term \u03b32R2(x; \u03b3) in\n(3.12) is of O(\u03b32\u22122\u03c3) for x = \u03c3|ln \u03b3|+O(1) (and \u03c3 > 0). Hence, the approximation of \u03c6h(x)\nby expansion (3.12) breaks down as x becomes of the order |ln \u03b3|. On the other hand, it also\nfollows that \u03c61appr(x) = \u03c6\ufb02ux(x) + \u03b3\u03c61(x) is a uniform O(\u03b3)-accurate approximation of \u03c6h(x)\non an interval (\u2212\u221e, L] for L = 12 |ln \u03b3|+O(1). Since \u03c6\ufb02ux(L) + \u03b3\u03c61(L) = O(\n\u221a\n\u03b3) for such L,\nwe can compute L\u03c0 =\n1\n2 |ln \u03b3|+O(1), as L\u03c0 is the value of x at which\n0 =\nd\ndx\n\u03c6h(x) =\nd\ndx\n\u03c61appr(x) +O(\u03b3) =\nd\ndx\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(x) + \u03b3\nd\ndx\n\u03c61|u(x) +O(\u03b3).\nWe introduce Y by ex = Y\u221a\u03b3 , so that it follows by (3.2) and (3.17) that Y =\n4\u221a\n\u03c0\n+O(\u221a\u03b3), i.e.,\nL\u03c0(\u03b3) =\n1\n2\n|ln \u03b3|+ ln 4\u221a\n\u03c0\n+O(\u221a\u03b3).\nA straightforward calculation shows that (in the new coordinates)\n\u03c6h(L\u03c0) = 2\u03c0 \u2212 2\n\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3).\nAs \u03c6h(x) and \u03c6\ufb02ux(x) both converge exponentially fast to \ufb01xed points which are order \u03b3 apart\nfor x \u2192 \u2212\u221e, it follows immediately that \u03c61(x; \u03b3) = O(1) and R2(x; \u03b3) = O(1), uniform for\nx < 0.\nNow we are ready to consider the stability of the various types of \u03c0-\ufb02uxons individually.\n3.1. Stability of the type 1 solution.\nLemma 3.5. For all 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < \u03b3cr, all eigenvalues of L1(x; \u03b3) are strictly negative. For\n\u03b3 = \u03b3cr, the operator L1(x; \u03b3cr) has 0 as its largest eigenvalue. For \u03b3 = 0, the largest eigenvalue\nis \u221214(\n\u221a\n5+ 1). Furthermore, for all 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < \u03b3cr, the type 1 semikinks \u03c61\u03c0(x; \u03b3) are Lyapunov\nstable in the following sense. For all \u03b5 > 0, there is some \u03b4 > 0 such that any solution\n\u03c6(x, t) of the semi\ufb02uxon equation (3.1), which is convergent to 0 at x \u2192 \u2212\u221e and to \u03c0 at\nx \u2192 +\u221e and which satis\ufb01es initially \u2016\u03c6(\u00b7, 0) \u2212 \u03c61\u03c0(\u00b7; \u03b3)\u2016H1 + \u2016\u03c6t(\u00b7, 0)\u2016L2 < \u03b4, will satisfy\n\u2016\u03c6(\u00b7, t)\u2212 \u03c61\u03c0(\u00b7; \u03b3)\u2016L2 + \u2016\u03c6t(\u00b7, t)\u2016L2 < \u03b5 for all t \u2208 R.\nProof. From Lemma 3.3 it follows that L1 has an eigenvalue \u039b = 0 at \u03b3 = \u03b3cr. The eigen-\nfunction is Dx\u03c6\n1\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3cr) and this function is always positive, since \u03c6\n1\n\u03c0(x; \u03b3cr) is monotonically\nincreasing. From Sturm\u2019s theorem, it follows that \u039b = 0 is the largest eigenvalue of L1 at\n\u03b3 = \u03b3cr. Next we consider \u03b3 = 0. We can explicitly determine all eigenvalues of L1(x; 0).\nFrom the explicit expression for \u03c61\u03c0 it follows that L1(x; 0) is a continuous even operator. For\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 111\n\ufb01xed \u039b, the operator L1(x; 0) \u2212 \u039b has two linearly independent solutions. Since the \ufb01xed\npoint is a saddle point and the decay rate to this \ufb01xed point is like e\u2212x, there is one solution\nthat is exponentially decaying at +\u221e and there is one solution that is exponentially decaying\nat \u2212\u221e, if \u039b > \u22121. If we denote the exponentially decaying function at \u2212\u221e by v\u2212(x; \u039b), then\nthe exponentially decaying function at +\u221e up to a constant is given by v+(x; \u039b) = v\u2212(\u2212x; \u039b)\n(since L1 is symmetric in x). Obviously, v+(0; \u039b) = v\u2212(0; \u039b); hence \u039b is an eigenvalue if\nDxv+(0; \u039b) = Dxv\u2212(0; \u039b) (i.e., when Dxv\u2212(0; \u039b) = 0) or if v\u2212(0; \u039b) = 0.\nUsing [23], we can derive explicit expressions for the solutions v\u2212(x; \u039b) (see also [10]).\nUsing x1 = ln(\n\u221a\n2 + 1), we have\nv\u2212(x; 0) = sech(x\u2212 x1), v\u2212(x; \u039b) = e\u03bc(x\u2212x1) [tanh(x\u2212 x1)\u2212 \u03bc], \u03bc =\n\u221a\n\u039b + 1.\nA straightforward calculation shows that v\u2212(0; \u039b) \u0006= 0. The condition Dxv\u2212(0; \u039b) = 0 gives\nthat\n\u03bc2 \u2212 1\n2\n\u221a\n2\u03bc\u2212 1\n2\n= 0; hence\n\u221a\n\u039b + 1 =\n1\n4\n\u221a\n2(\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1)\u21d2 \u039b = \u22121\n4\n(\n\u221a\n5 + 1).\nNow assume that the operator L1(x; \u03b3) has a positive eigenvalue \u039b1(\u03b3) for some 0 \u2264 \u03b3 <\n\u03b3cr. Since \u039b depends continuously on \u03b3, there has to be some 0 < \u03b3\u0302 < \u03b3cr such that \u039b\n1(\u03b3\u0302) = 0.\nHowever, from Lemma 3.3 it follows that this is not possible.\nNonlinear or Lyapunov stability can be derived by looking at the \u201ctemporal Hamiltonian\u201d\nH(\u03c6, p) =\n\u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\n[\n1\n2\np2 +\n1\n2\n(\u03c6x)\n2 \u2212 cos(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\u2212 \u03b3(\u03c6+ \u03b8)\n]\ndx.\nThis functional is a Lyapunov function for the system (3.1); i.e., any solution \u03c6(x, t) \u2208 H2(R)\nof (3.1) satis\ufb01es ddtH(\u03c6, \u03c6t) = 0, and henceH(\u03c6(\u00b7, t), \u03c6t(\u00b7, t)) = H(\u03c6(\u00b7, 0), \u03c6t(\u00b7, 0)) for any t \u2208 R.\nFurthermore, the linearization D2H at (\u03c6, p) = (\u03c61\u03c0, 0) (the point related to the \u03c0-\ufb02uxon) is\ngiven by\nD2H(\u03c61\u03c0, 0) =\n( \u2212L1(x; \u03b3) 0\n0 I\n)\n,\nwhich is a strictly positive de\ufb01nite self-adjoint operator on L2(R)\u00d7L2(R) with domainH2(R)\u00d7\nL2(R). So there is some c > 0 such that for any (\u03c6, p) \u2208 H2\u00d7L2, we have H(\u03c6, p)\u2212H(\u03c61\u03c0, 0) \u2265\nc(\u2016\u03c6\u2212\u03c61\u03c0\u20162L2+\u2016p\u20162L2); see, e.g., [14, 36]. Finally, it is straightforward to prove that there is some\nC > 0 such that H(\u03c6, p)\u2212H(\u03c61\u03c0, 0) \u2264 C(\u2016\u03c6\u2212 \u03c61\u03c0\u20162H1 + \u2016p\u20162L2) for any (\u03c6, p) \u2208 H2 \u00d7L2.\nUsing standard procedures in MATLAB, the eigenvalues of the type 1 \u03c0-\ufb02uxon have been\ncalculated numerically as a function of the applied bias current \u03b3 and are presented in Fig-\nure 2(a). Further details of the computational procedure are presented in section 6. Figure 2(a)\nshows that the type 1 semi\ufb02uxon has only one eigenvalue. This eigenvalue tends to zero when\nthe bias current \u03b3 approaches the critical value \u03b3cr as has been derived analytically. It was\n\ufb01rst proposed in [15, 20, 21] that a constant driving force can excite the largest eigenvalue of\na semi\ufb02uxon toward zero.\nWhen we apply a bias current above the critical value \u03b3cr, numerics show that the sta-\ntionary \u03c0-kink bifurcates into a semi\ufb02uxon that reverses its polarity and releases a \ufb02uxon.\n112 G.

The numerics show that the instability leads to the release of wave trains of traveling wave \ufb02uxons.\nIn this evolution a damping, which is proportional to \u03c6t, has been applied to the system.\nThis process keeps repeating itself: the semi\ufb02uxon changes its direction back and forth with\nreleasing a \ufb02uxon or anti\ufb02uxon in every change. A simulation of the release of \ufb02uxons from a\nsemi\ufb02uxon is presented in Figure 2(b). In experiments, the polarity of a semi\ufb02uxon can also\nbe reversed by applying a magnetic \ufb01eld [13].\nWhen \u03b3 = \u03b3cr, the type 1 and type 3 semi\ufb02uxons coincide. From the numerical analysis\nof the eigenvalues of the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon (see section 3.3 for details), it follows that there\nis an eigenvalue at the edge of the continuous spectrum for \u03b3 = \u03b3cr.

Using the approximation for the homoclinic orbit \u03c6h(x; \u03b3) in Lemma 3.4, we see\nthat, for \u03b3 small, an approximation for the \u03c0-\ufb02uxon of type 2 is given by (as before, x1 =\nln(1 +\n\u221a\n2))\n\u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(x+ x1) +O(\u03b3), x < 0,\n\u03c0 + \u03c6\ufb02ux(x\u02dc) + \u03b3\u03c61(x\u02dc) + \u03b3\n2R2(x\u02dc; \u03b3), 0 < x < L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1,\n\u03c0 + \u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x\u0302) + \u03b3\u03c61(\u2212x\u0302) + \u03b32R2(\u2212x\u0302; \u03b3), x > L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1,\n(3.18)\nwith x\u02dc = x\u2212 x1 and x\u0302 = x\u2212 2L\u03c0(\u03b3)\u2212 x1.\nThere is no limit for \u03b3 \u2192 0, since the semi\ufb02uxon breaks into two parts, one of them\nbeing the 3\u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c623\u03c0(x; 0). In a similar way as we found the largest eigenvalue for the\nlinearization operator L1(x; 0) about the \u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c61\u03c0(x; 0), we can \ufb01nd the largest eigenvalue\nfor the linearization operator L2(x; 0) about the 3\u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c623\u03c0(x; 0). The largest eigenvalue\nis \u039b2(0) = 14(\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1) and the eigenfunction is\n\u03c82(x; 0) =\n{\ne\u03bc0(x+x1)(\u03bc0 \u2212 tanh(x+ x1)), x < 0,\ne\u03bc0(\u2212x+x1)(\u03bc0 \u2212 tanh(\u2212x+ x1)), x > 0,\nwhere \u03bc0 =\n\u221a\n\u039b2(0) + 1 = 14\n\u221a\n2(1 +\n\u221a\n5).

The eigenvalue \u039b follows from \u03bc =\n\u221a\n\u039b2 + 1. Note that\nthe secular term which is growing at in\ufb01nity with the multiplication factor k3 is included in\nthis approximation. When \u03b3 = 0 and k3 = 0, the \ufb01rst two lines in the de\ufb01nition of \u03c8\n2 are the\neigenfunction of the linearized problem about the heteroclinic connection between 0 and 3\u03c0,\nas presented above. When \u03b3 is nonzero, k3 can be of order O(\u03b3\u03c3) for \u03c3 > \u03bc2 as the secular\nterm is of order O(\u03b3\u2212\u03bc\/2) at x = L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1.\nThe constants k2, k3, and k4 and the parameter \u03bc have to be chosen such that for \u03b3 > 0\n(but small) the function \u03c82(x, \u03b3) is continuously di\ufb00erentiable at x = 0 and x = L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1.\nFrom the continuity conditions at x = 0, we obtain\nk2 =\n\u221a\n2\n4\u03bc(\u03bc\u2212 1)(\u03bc+ 1) +O(\n\u221a\n\u03b3),\nk3 =\n(3 + 2\n\u221a\n2)\u03bc(2\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc\u221a2\u2212 1)(2\u03bc\u2212\u221a2)\n4\u03bc(\u03bc2 \u2212 1) +O(\n\u221a\n\u03b3).\nFrom one of the continuity conditions at x = L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1, we obtain k4 = k4(k2, k3, \u03bc).\nNow we are left with one more matching condition. Values of \u03bc for which this condition is\n114 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nsatis\ufb01ed correspond to the eigenvalues of the operator L2(x; \u03b3) for \u03b3 small. More explicitly,\nthe spectral parameter \u03bc has to satisfy the equation\nF(\u03bc) = 16\u03bck3(\u03bc\u2212 1)2(\u03b3\u03c0)\u2212\u03bc((3\u03bc+ 4)\u03c0\u03b3 + 16\u03bc) +O(\u03b3\u2212\u03bc+2) = 0.(3.19)\nNote that this expression is not de\ufb01ned at \u03b3 = 0. This corresponds to the singularities in\nthe expression for \u03c62 as \u03b3 \u2192 0 due to the fact that L\u03c0(\u03b3) \u2192 \u221e for \u03b3 \u2192 0. Evaluating\nF(\u03bc) (\u03b3\u03c0)\u03bc at \u03b3 = 0, we see that there are four positive roots for \u03bc, leading to four squared\neigenvalues, namely, \u039b(0) = 14(\n\u221a\n5 \u2212 1), \u221212 , and the double eigenvalue \u039b(0) = 0. The \ufb01rst\ntwo come from the zeros of k3 and are related to the eigenvalues of the 3\u03c0-\ufb02uxon. The double\nzero eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the \ufb02uxon. One can also notice that there is no term\nwith a multiplication factor k2 to this leading order. This term appears at most of order\nO(\u03b3\u03bc+2). Finally, as with the type 1 semi\ufb02uxon, the root \u03bc = 0 corresponds to the edge of\nthe continuous spectrum and the \u201ceigenfunction\u201d is not in H2(R).\nThe proof that the largest eigenvalue is near 14(\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1) for \u03b3 small will be complete if we\ncan show that F\u03bc(\n\u221a\n2\/4(1 +\n\u221a\n5)) \u0006= 0, i.e., the nondegeneracy condition that says that the\neigenvalue can be continued continuously for \u03b3 small.\nSimple algebraic calculations give that\nF\u03bc\n(\u221a\n2\n4\n(1 +\n\u221a\n5)\n)\n= c1\u03b3\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2\n4\n(1+\n\u221a\n5) +O(\u03b31\u2212\n\u221a\n2\n4\n(1+\n\u221a\n5))(3.20)\nwith c1 a positive constant. Hence, F\u03bc(\n\u221a\n2\n4 (1 +\n\u221a\n5)) > 0.\nThis completes the proof that the largest eigenvalue is near 14(\n\u221a\n5 \u2212 1) for small but\npositive \u03b3. Since the largest eigenvalue depends continuously on \u03b3, it can only disappear at\na bifurcation point. There are no bifurcation points and it is not possible that the eigenvalue\nbecomes 0 (see Lemma 3.3); hence the largest eigenvalue will be positive as long as \ufb02uxon\n\u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3) exists, i.e., for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3\n\u2217.\nRemark 3.7. We cannot use a comparison theorem, because \u03c62\u03c0 < \u03c6\n3\n\u03c0 for x < 0 and\n\u03c62\u03c0 > \u03c6\n3\n\u03c0 for x > 0.\nTo consider the relation between the eigenvalues of L2(x; \u03b3) and the stability problem of\n\u03c62\u03c0(x; \u03b3), we denote the largest eigenvalue of L2(x; \u03b3) by \u039b2(\u03b3). The associated eigenvalues\nfor the linearizations are solutions of the equation \u03bb2 \u2212 \u039b2(\u03b3) = 0; hence \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a\u039b2(\u03b3).\nSince \u039b2(\u03b3) > 0, this implies that one of the two eigenvalues has positive real part; hence\nthe \u03c0-\ufb02uxons of type 2 are unstable. The numerically obtained eigenvalues of semi\ufb02uxons of\nthis type as a function of \u03b3 are shown in Figure 3(a). In the proof of Lemma 3.6 we have\nfound three di\ufb00erent eigenvalues for \u03b3 small and the possibility of a fourth eigenvalue coming\nout of the continuous spectrum at \u03b3 = 0. In Figure 3(a), we see the continuation of those\neigenvalues. In Figure 3(b), we present the evolution of a 3\u03c0-kink (3.11) which is the limit of\na type 2 semi\ufb02uxon when \u03b3 \u2192 0. The separation of a \ufb02uxon from the semi\ufb02uxon is clearly\nseen and indicates the instability of the state (which con\ufb01rms the analysis in the proof of\nLemma 3.6).\nRemark 3.8. A type 2 semi\ufb02uxon can be seen as a concatenation of a 3\u03c0- and a \u22122\u03c0-kink\nin the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0. In that limit the other eigenvalues of L2(x; \u03b3) converge to 0, \u221212 , and \u22121.\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 115\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n\u03b3\n\u039b\n(a)\nx\nt\n \n \n\u221240 \u221220 0 20 40\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n(b)\nFigure 3.

Instability of type 3 solutions.\nLemma 3.9. For all 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3cr, the largest eigenvalue of L3(x; \u03b3) is strictly positive. For\n\u03b3 = \u03b3cr, the operator L3(x; \u03b3cr) has 0 as its largest eigenvalue.\n116 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nProof. The solution \u03c63\u03c0(x, \u03b3cr) = \u03c6\n1\n\u03c0(x, \u03b3cr); hence from Lemma 3.5 it follows that the\nlargest eigenvalue is \u039b = 0.\nFor \u03b3 near zero, we will use the approximation for the homoclinic orbit \u03c6h(x; \u03b3) in\nLemma 3.4 to get an approximation for the type 3 \ufb02uxon\n\u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03c61appr(x\u0302) = \u03c6\ufb02ux(x\u0302) + \u03b3\u03c61(x\u0302) + \u03b3\n2R2(x\u0302; \u03b3), x < \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1,\n\u03c62appr(x\u02dc) = \u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x\u02dc) + \u03b3\u03c61(\u2212x\u02dc) + \u03b32R2(\u2212x\u02dc; \u03b3), \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1 < x < 0,\n\u03c63appr(\u2212x\u2212 x1) = \u03c0 + \u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x\u2212 x1) +O(\u03b3), x > 0,\nwhere x\u02dc = x\u2212 x1 and x\u0302 = x\u2212 x1 + 2L\u03c0(\u03b3).\nIn the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0, the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon breaks into a type 1 semi\ufb02uxon and a \ufb02uxon.\nBoth are stable and the largest eigenvalue of the \ufb02uxon is zero, while the largest eigenvalue of\nthe type 1 semi\ufb02uxon is negative. Hence to approximate the largest eigenvalue of the type 3\nsemi\ufb02uxon for \u03b3 small, we set\n\u039b(\u03b3) = \u03b3\u039b1(\u03b3).\nTo construct the \ufb01rst part of the approximation of the eigenfunction, we consider x < \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3)+\nx1; i.e., x\u0302 < L\u03c0(\u03b3). In this part of the argument, we will drop the hat in x\u0302. On (\u2212\u221e, L\u03c0), we\nexpand \u03c81approx = \u03c80 + \u03b3\u03c81; this yields the following equations for \u03c80,1(x):\nL\u03c80 = 0, L\u03c81 = [\u039b1(0)\u2212 \u03c61(x) sin\u03c6\ufb02ux(x)]\u03c80.(3.21)\nAs \u03c81approx has to be an eigenfunction, we have \u03c8\n1\napprox(x) \u2192 0 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Furthermore,\nwe remove the scaling invariance by assuming that \u03c81approx(0) = 1. This implies that \u03c80(x) is\ngiven by\n\u03c80(x) =\n1\ncoshx\n(3.22)\n(see (3.16)). To solve the \u03c81-equation, we note that\nd\ndx\u03c61(x) is a solution of\nL\u03c8 = \u2212\u03c61 sin\u03c6\ufb02ux d\ndx\n\u03c6\ufb02ux = \u22122\u03c61 sin\u03c6\ufb02ux\u03c80\n(see (3.15) and (3.2)) so that we \ufb01nd as a general solution\n\u03c81(x) =\n[\nA\u2212 1\n2\n\u039b1\n(\nln(coshx) +\n\u222b x\n0\n\u03be\ncosh2 \u03be\nd\u03be\n)]\n1\ncoshx\n+\n[\nB +\n1\n2\n\u039b1 tanhx\n]( x\ncoshx\n+ sinhx\n)\n+\n1\n2\nd\ndx\n\u03c61.\nUsing limx\u2192\u2212\u221e \u03c81(x) = 0 and \u03c81(0) = 0 we \ufb01nd that A = \u03c04 , B =\n1\n2\u039b1(0). As in the case of\n\u03c61(x), we are especially interested in the unbounded parts of \u03c81(x) and\nd\ndx\u03c81(x),\n\u03c81|u(x) = 12\u039b1(1 + tanhx) sinhx\u2212 12 arctan ex coshx,\nd\ndx\u03c81|u(x) = 12\u039b1(1 + tanhx) coshx\u2212 12 arctan ex sinhx.\n(3.23)\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 117\nWe note that the error term |\u03c8(x) \u2212 \u03c81appr(x)| = \u03b32|S2(x; \u03b3)| is at most O(\u03b3) on (\u2212\u221e, L\u03c0)\n(the analysis is similar to that for \u03b32|R2(x; \u03b3)|).\nNext consider the second part of the approximation, i.e., x between \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1 and 0.\nHere we de\ufb01ne the translated coordinate x\u02dc = x \u2212 x1, which is on the interval (\u2212L\u03c0,\u2212x1),\nand again we drop the tildes. Since we have to match \u03c81appr(x) to the approximation \u03c8\n2\nappr(x)\nof \u03c8(x), along \u03c62appr(x) and thus de\ufb01ned on the interval (\u2212L\u03c0,\u2212x1), we need to compute\n\u03c81appr(L\u03c0) and\nd\ndx\u03c8\n1\nappr(L\u03c0) which to the leading order are calculated from (3.23); i.e.,\n\u03c81appr(L\u03c0) =\n2\u039b1(0)\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3), d\ndx\n\u03c81appr(L\u03c0) =\n2\u039b1(0)\u2212 \u03c0\u221a\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3).(3.24)\nThus, both \u03c81appr(L\u03c0) and\nd\ndx\u03c8\n1\nappr(L\u03c0) are O(\n\u221a\n\u03b3).\nNow, we choose a special form for \u03c82appr(x), the continuation of \u03c8(x), i.e., the part lin-\nearized along \u03c62appr(x). It is our aim to determine the value of \u039b1, for which there exists a\npositive integrable C1 solution \u03c8 of L3(x; \u03b3)\u03c8 = \u03b3\u039b1(0)\u03c8. By general Sturm\u2013Liouville the-\nory [33] we know that this value of \u039b1 must be the largest eigenvalue. Our strategy is to try\nto continue \u03c8(x) beyond (\u2212\u221e, L\u03c0) by a function that remains at most O(\u221a\u03b3); i.e., we do not\nfollow the approach of the existence analysis and thus do not re\ufb02ect and translate \u03c81appr(x)\nto construct \u03c82appr(x) (since this solution becomes in general O(1) for x = O(1)). Instead, we\nscale \u03c82appr(x) as \u03b3\u03c8\u02dc(x). The linearization \u03c8\u02dc(x) along \u03c6\n2\nappr(x) on the interval (\u2212L\u03c0, x1) must\nsolve L\u03c8\u02dc = O(\u03b3); thus, at leading order\n\u03c8\u02dc(x) =\nA\u02dc\ncoshx\n+ B\u02dc\n( x\ncoshx\n+ sinhx\n)\n.(3.25)\nThe approximation \u03c82appr(x) = \u03b3\u03c8\u02dc(x) must be matched to \u03c8\n1\nappr(L\u03c0) and\nd\ndx\u03c8\n1\nappr(L\u03c0) at\nx = \u2212L\u03c0; i.e.,\n2\u039b1(0)\u221a\n\u03c0\n= \u2212 2B\u02dc\u221a\n\u03c0\n+O(\u221a\u03b3), 2\u039b1(0)\u2212 \u03c0\u221a\n\u03c0\n=\n2B\u02dc\u221a\n\u03c0\n+O(\u221a\u03b3).\nNote that A\u02dc does not appear in these equations; as a consequence, \u03c81appr(x) and \u03c8\n2\nappr(x) can\nonly be matched for a special value of \u039b1, \u039b1(0) =\n1\n4\u03c0, with B\u02dc = \u2212\u039b1(0) < 0. Thus for this\nspecial value of \u039b1 and for A\u02dc > 0, we have found a positive C\n1-continuation of the solution\n\u03c8(x) of the eigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3)\u2014recall that x < 0 in the domain of \u03c8\u02dc(x). At the\npoint of discontinuity (\u2212x1 for \u03c8\u02dc(x), or at x = 0 in the original coordinates of (3.1)), we have\n\u03c82appr(\u2212x1) = \u03b3\u03c8\u02dc(\u2212x1) = \u03b3[12\n\u221a\n2A\u02dc\u2212 \u03c08\n\u221a\n2(ln(\n\u221a\n2\u2212 1)\u2212\n\u221a\n2)] +O(\u03b32),\nd\ndx\u03c8\n2\nappr(\u2212x1) = \u03b3 ddx \u03c8\u02dc(\u2212x1) = \u03b3[12A\u02dc\u2212 \u03c08 (ln(\n\u221a\n2\u2212 1) + 3\n\u221a\n2)] +O(\u03b32).\n(3.26)\nHence, we have constructed for a special choice of \u039b, \u039b = \u039b\u2217 = \u03c04\u03b3 + O(\u03b3\n\u221a\n\u03b3) > 0, an\napproximation of a family of positive solutions of the eigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3) on\nx < 0\u2014in the coordinates of (3.1)\u2014that attain the values given by (3.26) at x = 0, and\nthat decay to 0 as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The question is now whether we can \u201cglue\u201d an element of this\nfamily in a C1-fashion to a solution of the eigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3) on x > 0\u2014with\n118 G. DERKS, A.

If that is possible, we have constructed a\npositive integrable solution to the eigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3), which implies that \u039b\u2217 > 0\nis the critical eigenvalue and that \u03c63\u03c0(x) is unstable.\nAn approximation of \u03c8(x) on x > 0, \u03c83appr(x), is obtained by linearizing along \u03c6\n3\nappr(x)\nand by translating x so that x \u2208 (x1,\u221e). Since \u03c83appr(x) has to match to expressions of O(\u03b3)\n(3.26) at x1, we also scale \u03c8\n3\nappr(x), \u03c8\n3\nappr(x) = \u03b3\u03c8\u02c6(x). We \ufb01nd that L\u03c8\u02c6 = O(\u03b3) so that \u03c8\u02c6(x)\nagain has to be (at leading order) a linear combination of \u03c8b(x) and \u03c8u(x) (3.16). However,\n\u03c8\u02c6 must be bounded as x \u2192 \u221e, which yields that \u03c8\u02c6(x) = A\u02c6\/coshx + O(\u03b3) for some A\u02c6 \u2208 R.\nAt the point of discontinuity we thus have\n\u03c83appr(x1) = \u03b3\u03c8\u02c6(x1) =\n1\n2\n\u221a\n2A\u02c6\u03b3 +O(\u03b32),\nd\ndx\u03c8\n3\nappr(x1) = \u03b3\nd\ndx \u03c8\u02dc(x1) = \u221212A\u02c6\u03b3 +O(\u03b32).\n(3.27)\nA positive C1-solution of the eigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3) exists (for \u039b = \u039b\u2217) if there exist\nA\u02dc, A\u02c6 > 0 such that (see (3.26) and (3.27))\n1\n2\n\u221a\n2A\u02dc \u2212 \u03c08\n\u221a\n2(ln(\n\u221a\n2\u2212 1)\u2212\n\u221a\n2) = 12\n\u221a\n2A\u02c6,\n1\n2A\u02dc \u2212 \u03c08 (ln(\n\u221a\n2\u2212 1) + 3\n\u221a\n2) = \u221212A\u02c6.\n(3.28)\nSince the solution of this system is given by A\u02dc = 14\u03c0[\n\u221a\n2 + ln(\n\u221a\n2\u2212 1)] > 0 and A\u02c6 = 12\u03c0\n\u221a\n2 >\n0, we conclude that the eigenvalue problem for the \u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3) has a positive largest\neigenvalue\n\u039b\u2217 =\n\u03c0\n4\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3\u221a\u03b3).(3.29)\nHence the eigenvalue for \u03b3 small is positive. From Lemma 3.3 it follows that there are\nno zero eigenvalues between 0 and \u03b3cr; hence the largest eigenvalue of L3(\u03b3) is positive for all\nvalues of \u03b3.\nRemark 3.10. For any \u03bb = O(\u221a\u03b3) or, equivalently, any \u039b1 = O(1), there exists a (nor-\nmalized) solution to the eigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3) on x < 0 that decays as x \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\nand that is approximated by \u03c81appr(x) and \u03c8\n2\nappr(x) (matched in a C\n1-fashion at \u00b1L\u03c0). If \u039b1\nis not O(\u221a\u03b3) close to 14\u03c0, however, \u03c82appr(x) cannot be scaled as \u03b3\u03c8\u02dc(x) and the solution is\nnot O(\u03b3) at the point of discontinuity\u2014in general it is O(1). Moreover, for any \u039b1 = O(1),\nthere also exists on x > 0 a 1-parameter family of (nonnormalized) eigenfunctions for the\neigenvalue problem for L3(x; \u03b3) that decay as x \u2192 \u221e. In this family there is one unique\nsolution that connects continuously to the (normalized) solution at x < 0. In fact, one could\nde\ufb01ne the jump in the derivative at x = 0, J (\u03bb; \u03b3), as an Evans function expression (note that\nJ (\u03bb; \u03b3) can be computed explicitly at \u03b3 = 0; see [10]). By de\ufb01nition, \u03bb2 is an eigenfunction\nof L3(x; \u03b3) if and only if J (\u03bb; \u03b3) = 0. In the above analysis we have shown that J (\u03bb\u2217; \u03b3) = 0\nfor \u03bb\u2217 = 12\n\u221a\n\u03c0\u03b3 +O(\u03b3).\nRemark 3.11.

The eigenvalues of the linear operator associated to the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon as a function of the bias\ncurrent \u03b3. The result that the largest eigenvalue is always positive shows the instability of the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon.\nWhen \u03b3 \u0004 1, according to (3.29) the largest eigenvalue is approximated by \u039b = \u03c0\n4\n\u03b3, shown in dash-dotted line.\nThe dashed line is the boundary of the continuous spectrum.\nunstable eigenvalue can be obtained from (3.24). The corresponding eigenfunction is approx-\nimated by \u03c81appr(x) on (\u2212\u221e, L\u03c0), and we conclude from (3.24) that ddx\u03c81appr(L\u03c0) = 0 for\n\u03bb2 = \u03b3\u039b1 = \u03b3\n\u03c0\n2 +O(\u03b3\n\u221a\n\u03b3) (while \u03c81appr(L\u03c0) > 0). Hence, for this value of \u039b1, we can match\n\u03c81appr(x) to \u03c8\n2\nappr(x) = \u03c8\n1\nappr(\u2212x) in a C1-fashion; it gives a uniform O(\u03b3)-approximation of\nthe critical, positive (even, \u201ctwo-hump\u201d) eigenfunction of the \ufb02uxon\/anti\ufb02uxon pair at the\neigenvalue \u03bb+ =\n1\n2\n\u221a\n2\u03c0\n\u221a\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3) > 0.\nTo consider the relation between the eigenvalues of L3(x; \u03b3) and the stability problem of\n\u03c63\u03c0(x; \u03b3), we denote the largest eigenvalue of L3(x; \u03b3) by \u039b3(\u03b3). The associated eigenvalues for\nthe linearizations are a solution of the equation \u03bb2 \u2212 \u039b3(\u03b3) = 0; hence \u03bb = \u00b1\u221a\u039b3(\u03b3). Since\n\u039b3(\u03b3) > 0, this implies that one of the two eigenvalues has positive real part; hence the \ufb02uxons\nof type 3 are unstable. In Figure 4, we present numerical calculations of the eigenvalues of\nthe type 3 semi\ufb02uxon as a function of the bias current \u03b3.\nRemark 3.12. A type-3 semi\ufb02uxon can be seen as a concatenation of a 2\u03c0- and a \u2212\u03c0-kink\nin the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0. In that limit the other eigenvalue of L3(x; \u03b3) converges to \u221214(\n\u221a\n5 + 1)\n(Figure 4) which is a contribution of the \u2212\u03c0-kink.\n4. Lattice \u03c0-kinks and their spectra in the continuum limit. In this section, we consider\n(2.9) for a small lattice spacing a, i.e., the driven 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation with a small pertur-\nbation due to lattice spacing e\ufb00ects. For a = 0, the semi\ufb02uxons of all types are constructed as\nheteroclinic connections with transversal intersections at x = 0 in the two-dimensional phase\nspace of the static equation (2.10). Therefore, all three types of semi\ufb02uxons will still exist in\nthe perturbed system with 0 < a\u0004 1; see [11]. The three types of semi\ufb02uxons are denoted as\n\u03c6i\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) for i = 1, 2, and 3. In Figure 5, we present the phase portraits of the sine-Gordon\nequation both with and without the e\ufb00ect of a perturbation due to lattice spacing.\nThe lattice spacing a does not a\ufb00ect the stationary points of the phase portraits, as can be\neasily checked.

For \u03b3 > \u03b3cr(a) no static semi\ufb02uxon exists.\nAs we have seen in the last section, for a = 0, the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon is marginally unstable\nat \u03b3 = \u03b3cr and \u03b3 near zero. So there is a possibility that lattice spacing e\ufb00ects stabilize the\ntype 3 semi\ufb02uxon near those values of \u03b3. However, it turns out that this is not the case and\nthe stability of the semi\ufb02uxons is similar to the case a = 0.\nTheorem 4.1. For a small, the linearizations about the \u03c0-kinks have the following proper-\nties:\n(i) The eigenvalues of the linearization about the monotonic type 1 \u03c0-kink \u03c61\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3)\nare strictly negative for 0 \u2264 \u03b3 < \u03b3cr(a). At \u03b3 = \u03b3cr(a), the largest eigenvalue is zero. These\n\u03c0-kinks are linearly stable.\n(ii) The largest eigenvalue of the linearization about the monotonic type 2 \u03c0-kink \u03c62\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3)\nis strictly positive for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3\u2217(a). These \u03c0-kinks are linearly unstable.\n(iii) The largest eigenvalue of the linearization about the monotonic type 3 \u03c0-kink \u03c63\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3)\nis strictly positive for 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3cr(a). These \u03c0-kinks are linearly unstable. In the limit for\n\u03b3 \u2192 0 and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3cr(a), the largest eigenvalue converges to zero.\nThe proof of this theorem will proceed along similar lines as the proof in the previous\nsection. First we consider the eigenvalue problem of a solution \u03c6i\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3), which can be\nwritten as\nLi(x; a; \u03b3) v = \u03bb2 v,\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 121\nwhere Li(x; a; \u03b3) is now de\ufb01ned as the linearization associated with (2.10), i.e.,\nLi(x; a; \u03b3) = Dxx \u2212 cos\n(\n\u03c6i\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x)\n)\n\u2212 a212\n[\n2 cos \u03c6\u02dcDxx \u2212 2(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; 0; \u03b3))x sin \u03c6\u02dcDx\n\u2212 1 + 2\u03b3 sin \u03c6\u02dc\u2212 ((\u03c6i\u03c0(x; 0; \u03b3))x)2 cos \u03c6\u02dc\n]\n+O(a4),\nwhere \u03c6\u02dc = \u03c6i\u03c0(x; 0; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x).\nLemma 3.3 can be extended to a \u0006= 0 and give a necessary and su\ufb03cient condition for\nLi(x; a; \u03b3) to have an eigenvalue \u039b = 0.\nLemma 4.2. The eigenvalue problem\nLi(x; \u03b3)v = \u039bv, x \u2208 R,\nhas an eigenvalue \u039b = 0 if and only if one of the following two conditions holds:\n(i) Dxx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) is continuous at x = 0; i.e., \u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; a; \u03b3) = k\u03c0\u2212 a2 \u03b312 +O(a4) for some\nk \u2208 Z;\n(ii) Dx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(0; a; \u03b3) = 0 and there are some x\u00b1, with sgn(x\u00b1) = \u00b11, such that Dx\u03c6i\u03c0(x\u00b1; a; \u03b3)\n\u0006= 0.\nProof. As the proof of Lemma 3.3 is based on the fact that the derivative of the semi\ufb02uxon\nis a solution of the linearized system for x \u0006= 0, we can follow the same arguments to prove\nthis lemma. Again this leads to two conditions: that either \u03c6ixx is continuous at x = 0 or the\nsecond condition as stated above.\nIn order to determine when \u03c6ixx is continuous, we use the static equation (2.10) and expand\nnear a = 0,\nDxx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) =\n(\nsin(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x))\u2212 \u03b3\n) (\n1\u2212 a212 cos \u03c6\u02dc\n)\n+ a\n2\n6 sin \u03c6\u02dc\n(\n\u03b3 arcsin \u03b3 +\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 \u2212 \u03b3\u03c6\u02dc\u2212 cos \u03c6\u02dc\n)\n+O(a4),\nagain with \u03c6\u02dc = \u03c6i\u03c0(x; 0; \u03b3) + \u03b8(x). The continuity of Dxx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0 at x = 0 leads to the expression\nfor \u03c6i\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) as given above.\nAt \u03b3 = \u03b3cr(a), the stable manifold of the \u03c0 + arcsin \u03b3 and the homoclinic connection at\narcsin \u03b3 are tangent, implying that Dxx\u03c6\ni\n\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) is continuous at x = 0. Thus the \ufb01rst\ncondition of the lemma is satis\ufb01ed at \u03b3 = \u03b3cr(a) for i = 1, 3. For the same reasons as before,\nthe second condition is never satis\ufb01ed.\nSince \u039b = 0 is an eigenvalue of the linearized operator Li(x; a; \u03b3) if and only if \u03b3 = \u03b3cr(a),\nthe sign of the eigenvalues of Li(x; a; \u03b3) will not change. Thus the behavior of the eigenvalues\nnear \u03b3 = 0 will again determine the stability of the semi\ufb02uxons.\nFor \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b8 = 0, the sine-Gordon equation with a perturbation due to the lattice\nspacing has a heteroclinic orbit connecting 0 and 2\u03c0. As before, the heteroclinic orbit will\nplay an important role in determining the stability of the semi\ufb02uxons for small values of \u03b3.\nFor small values of the lattice spacing a, we can approximate this heteroclinic orbit up to\norder a2 by using the 2\u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c6\ufb02ux and its linearization.\n122 G.

The integration constant A0 is determined by the requirement that \u03c6\na\n\ufb02ux(0) = \u03c0;\nhence \u03c6a(0) = 0, giving that A0 = 0.\nFor \u03b3 = 0, the static model (2.10) for a 0-\u03c0 Josephson junction with lattice spacing e\ufb00ects\nhas both a \u03c0- and a 3\u03c0-kink solution.

Writing v(x) = v0(x) +\na2v1(x) + O(a4) and \u039b = \u039b0 + a2\u039b1 + O(a4) and expanding the eigenvalue problem for the\nstability of the \u03c0-kink \u03c61\u03c0(x; a; 0) in a Taylor series result in the equations(L1(x; 0; 0)\u2212 \u039b0) v0(x) = 0,(L1(x; 0; 0)\u2212 \u039b0) v1(x) = (\u039b1 \u2212 u1\u03c0(x) sin(\u03c61\u03c0(x; 0) + \u03b8)) v0(x)\u2212 g(x),(4.8)\nwhere \u03bc =\n\u221a\n\u039b0 + 1, \u039b0 = \u221214(\n\u221a\n5 + 1),\nv0(x) =\n{\ne\u03bc(x\u2212ln(1+\n\u221a\n2)) [tanh(x\u2212 ln(1 +\n\u221a\n2))\u2212 \u03bc] for x < 0,\ne\u03bc(\u2212x\u2212ln(1+\n\u221a\n2)) [tanh(\u2212x\u2212 ln(1 +\n\u221a\n2))\u2212 \u03bc] for x > 0,\ng(x) = 112\n[\n2v0xx\u039b0 + v\n0 + 2v0xx cos \u03c6\u02dc(x)\u2212 2 cos2 \u03c6\u02dc(x)v0 \u2212 2\u2202xx(\u03c61\u03c0(x; 0)) sin \u03c6\u02dc(x)v0\n\u2212 2\u2202x\u03c61\u03c0(x; 0) sin \u03c6\u02dc(x)v0x \u2212 (\u2202x\u03c61\u03c0(x; 0))2 cos \u03c6\u02dc(x)v0 \u2212 v0\u039b20 \u2212 2v0\u039b0 cos \u03c6\u02dc(x)\n]\n,\nwith again \u03c6\u02dc(x) = \u03c61\u03c0(x; 0) + \u03b8(x) (see Lemma 3.5).\nThe parameter value of \u039b1 is calculated by solving (4.8) for a bounded and decaying\nsolution v1(x). The general solution can be derived by using the variation-of-constants method\nbecause we have the homogeneous solutions of the equation. One can also use the Fredholm\ntheorem (see, e.g., [30]); i.e., the su\ufb03cient and necessary condition for (4.8) to have a solution\nv1 \u2208 H2(R) is that the inhomogeneity is perpendicular to the null space of the self-adjoint\noperator of L1(x; 0; 0). If \u3008 , \u3009 denotes an inner product in H2(R), then this condition gives\n0 = \u3008(L1(x; 0; 0)\u2212 \u039b0)v1, v0\u3009 = \u3008\u039b1v0 \u2212 u1\u03c0v0 sin(\u03c61\u03c0(x; 0) + \u03b8)\u2212 g, v0\u3009,\nwhich implies that\n\u039b1 =\n3584(70\n\u221a\n2(1 +\n\u221a\n5)\u2212 99(1 +\u221a5))\n24576(\u221270\u221a10\u2212 350\u221a2 + 495 + 99\u221a5) \u2248 \u22120.0652.(4.9)\nNow assume that the operator L1(x; \u03b3) has a positive eigenvalue \u039b1(\u03b3) for some 0 \u2264 \u03b3 <\n\u03b3cr(a). Since \u039b depends continuously on \u03b3, there has to be some 0 < \u03b3\u0302 < \u03b3cr(a) such that\n\u039b1(\u03b3\u0302) = 0. However, from Lemma 4.2 it follows that this is not possible.\n124 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\n4.2. Instability of type 2 semi\ufb02uxon. In Lemma 3.6 we have seen that for a = 0, the\nlinearization about the type 2 semi\ufb02uxon has a strictly positive largest eigenvalue. Also the\nlimits of this eigenvalue for \u03b3 \u2192 0 and \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u2217 are still strictly positive. Thus a small\nperturbation associated with the lattice spacing cannot stabilize the type 2 semi\ufb02uxons.\nFor completeness, we will consider the case \u03b3 = 0. In this limit, the type 2 semi\ufb02uxon can\nbe seen as a concatenation of a 3\u03c0-kink and a \u22122\u03c0-kink. As before, the limit of the largest\neigenvalue for \u03b3 \u2192 0 will be equal to the largest eigenvalue of the 3\u03c0-kink. We have seen that\nthe largest eigenvalue of the 3\u03c0-kink at \u03b3 = 0 and a = 0 is strictly positive and the following\nlemma shows that small lattice spacing e\ufb00ects increase this eigenvalue.\nLemma 4.6. For the lattice spacing parameter a su\ufb03ciently small, the largest eigenvalue\nof the linearization L2(x; a; 0) about the 3\u03c0-kink \u03c623\u03c0(x; a; 0) is strictly positive. Moreover, it\nincreases as a increases and is proportional to 14(\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1) + 0.0652a2 +O(a4).\nProof. Note that the lowest order analytic expressions for the \u03c0- and the 3\u03c0-kinks di\ufb00er\nonly in the sign of the \u201ckink-shift\u201d (see (4.7)). Because of this, we can follow the same steps as\nthe proof of Lemma 4.5. Writing the largest eigenvalue of a 3\u03c0-kink as \u039b = \u039b0+a\n2\u039b1+O(a4),\nwith \u039b0 = (\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1)\/4 as has been calculated in Lemma 3.6, we compute \u039b1 to be\n\u039b1 =\n3584(665857(\n\u221a\n5\u2212 1)\u2212 470832\u221a2(\u221a5 + 1))\n24576(3329285\u2212 2354160\u221a2\u2212 665857\u221a5 + 470832\u221a10) \u2248 0.0652.(4.10)\nThus up to order O(a4) the lattice spacing e\ufb00ects destabilize the 3\u03c0-kink.\nBecause a 2\u03c0-\ufb02uxon in the \u201cordinary\u201d sine-Gordon equation can be pinned by lattice\nspacing e\ufb00ects, one might expect to have a stable 3\u03c0-kink in the 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation\nwith larger lattice spacing e\ufb00ects. This is con\ufb01rmed by numerical calculations in section 6;\nsee Figure 12. If the 3\u03c0-kink is stable for \u03b3 = 0, a stable type 2 semikink might exist for \u03b3 > 0\nwhen the repelling force between the 3\u03c0-kink and the anti\ufb02uxon is smaller than the energy\nto move a \ufb02uxon along lattices. However, in section 6 it will be shown numerically that the\ntype 2 semikink is unstable for all values of the lattice spacing; see Figure 13(b).\n4.3. Instability of type 3 semi\ufb02uxon. For \u03b3 small or close to \u03b3cr, it has been shown in\nLemma 3.9 that the type 3 semi\ufb02uxons are weakly unstable. This opens the possibility that\nthe perturbation term representing the lattice spacing stabilizes the semi\ufb02uxon. This is not\nthe case, however.\nLemma 4.7. For small lattice spacing a and bias current 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3cr(a), the largest eigen-\nvalue of the linearization L3(x; a; \u03b3) about the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon \u03c63\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3) is strictly positive.\nFor \u03b3 = \u03b3cr(a), the operator L3(x; a; \u03b3cr) has 0 as its largest eigenvalue. For \u03b3 near zero and\na2 = \u03b3a\u02c62, the largest eigenvalue of L3(x; a; \u03b3) is \u039b\u2217 =\n(\n\u03c0\n4 +\n7\n180 a\u02c6\n2\n)\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3\u221a\u03b3).\nProof. At \u03b3 = \u03b3cr, the solution \u03c6\n3\n\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3cr(a)) = \u03c6\n1\n\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3cr(a)). Hence from Lemma 4.5\nit follows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearization about \u03c63\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3cr(a)) vanishes.\nFrom Lemma 3.9 it follows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearization about \u03c63\u03c0(x; a; \u03b3)\nis positive for a = 0 and 0 < \u03b3 < \u03b3cr. Thus a small perturbation cannot change the positive\nsign of the largest eigenvalue if \u03b3 is not near 0 or \u03b3cr. Now assume that a small perturbation\nwould lead to a negative largest eigenvalue near \u03b3 = 0 or \u03b3 = \u03b3cr. Then there has to be a zero\neigenvalue near \u03b3 = 0 or \u03b3 = \u03b3cr, but this is not possible according to Lemma 4.5. Thus we\ncan conclude that the largest eigenvalue is always positive.\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 125\nTo complete the proof, we will derive the asymptotic expression of the eigenvalue near\n\u03b3 = 0. Since both a and \u03b3 are small, we relate those two parameters by writing a2 = \u03b3a\u02c62.\nNow the approximation for the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon can be written as\n\u03c63\u03c0(x; a\u02c6\n\u221a\n\u03b3; \u03b3) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(x\u0302) + \u03b3\u03c61(x\u0302) + \u03b3a\u02c6\n2\u03c6a(x\u0302) + \u03b3\n2R2(x\u0302; \u03b3), x < \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1,\n\u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x\u02dc) + \u03b3\u03c61(\u2212x\u02dc) + \u03b3a\u02c62\u03c6a(\u2212x\u02dc) + \u03b32R2(\u2212x\u02dc; \u03b3), \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1 < x < 0,\n\u03c0 + \u03c6\ufb02ux(\u2212x\u2212 x1) +O(\u03b3), x > 0,\nwhere x\u0302 = x \u2212 x1 + 2L\u03c0(\u03b3) and x\u02dc = x \u2212 x1. It can be shown that the shift L\u03c0(\u03b3) does not\ndepend on a\u02c62 in lowest order; i.e., L\u03c0(\u03b3) =\n1\n2 |ln \u03b3|+ ln 4\u221a\u03c0 +O(\n\u221a\n\u03b3).\nTo \ufb01nd the largest eigenvalue, we set again \u039b3(\u03b3) = \u03b3\u039b1(0) and follow the steps in the\nproof of Lemma 3.9 with some additional terms added to some expressions.\nFirst, we consider the part of the approximation with x < \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3) + x1 or x\u0302 < L\u03c0(\u03b3). As\nbefore, we drop the hat in x\u0302 in this part of the argument. On (\u2212\u221e, L\u03c0), the general solution\nof the eigenvalue problem of the order O(\u03b3) after expanding \u03c81approx = \u03c80 + \u03b3\u03c81 is\n\u03c81(x) =\n[\n\u03c0\n4\n\u2212 1\n2\n\u039b1\n(\nln coshx+\n\u222b x\n0\n\u03be\ncosh2 \u03be\nd\u03be\n)]\n1\ncoshx\n+\n[\n1\n2\n\u039b1(0) +\n1\n2\n\u039b1 tanhx\n]( x\ncoshx\n+ sinhx\n)\n+\n1\n2\n(\nd\ndx\n\u03c61 + a\u02c6\n2 d\ndx\n\u03c6a\n)\n\u2212 e\nx\n360(e2x + 1)3\n[\n16 ln 2 + e2x(32 ln 2\u2212 295 + 60x) + 30x+ 137 + 7e6x\n\u2212 16 ln(e2x + 1)(e2x + 1)2 + e4x(151 + 30x+ 16 ln 2)] .\nWe note that the error term |\u03c8(x)\u2212\u03c81appr(x)| = \u03b32|S2(x; \u03b3)| is still at most O(\u03b3) on (\u2212\u221e, L\u03c0).\nNext consider the second part of the approximation, i.e., x between \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3)+x1 and 0 or\nx\u02dc < \u2212L\u03c0(\u03b3). Again, we drop the tilde in x\u02dc. We scale \u03c8(x) as \u03b3\u03c8\u02dc(x). The linearization \u03c8\u02dc(x)\nalong \u03c62appr(x) on the interval (\u2212L\u03c0,\u2212x1) must solve L\u03c8\u02dc = O(\u03b3). Thus, at leading order\n\u03c8\u02dc(x) =\nA\u02dc\ncoshx\n+ B\u02dc\n( x\ncoshx\n+ sinhx\n)\n.\nThe last part of the approximation of \u03c8(x) on x > 0, \u03c83appr(x), is obtained by linearizing\nalong \u03c63appr(x) and by translating x so that x \u2208 (x1,\u221e). We also scale \u03c83appr(x) = \u03b3\u03c8\u02c6(x). As\n\u03c8\u02c6 must be bounded for x\u2192\u221e, it follows that \u03c8\u02c6(x) = A\u02c6\/coshx+O(\u03b3) for some A\u02c6 \u2208 R.\nFinally, we have to connect all parts of the eigenfunction in a C1-fashion. This determines\nthe values of \u039b1(0), A\u02dc, B\u02dc, and A\u02c6 as\n\u039b1(0) =\n1\n4\n\u03c0 +\n7\n180\na\u02c62, B\u02dc = \u2212\u039b1(0), A\u02dc = 1\n4\n\u03c0[\n\u221a\n2 + log(\n\u221a\n2\u2212 1)], and A\u02c6 = 1\n2\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n2;\nthus \u039b1(0) > 0, B\u02dc < 0, A\u02dc > 0, and A\u02c6 > 0. And we can conclude that the eigenvalue problem\nfor the \u03c0-\ufb02uxon \u03c63\u03c0(x; a\u02c6\n\u221a\n\u03b3; \u03b3) has a positive largest eigenvalue\n\u039b\u2217 =\n(\n\u03c0\n4\n+\n7\n180\na\u02c62\n)\n\u03b3 +O(\u03b3\u221a\u03b3).\n126 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\n5. Semikinks in the weak-coupling limit. In this section we will consider the discrete\n0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation (2.3) when the lattice parameter a is large. The time independent\nversion of (2.3) is well known: when \u03b3 = 0, it corresponds to the so-called standard or Taylor\u2013\nGreene\u2013Chirikov map [9], and when \u03b3 \u0006= 0, it is called the Josephson map [24]. Since we\nare interested in the case in which the lattice spacing a is large, we introduce the coupling\nparameter \u03b5 as \u03b5 = 1\na2\nand the equation becomes\n\u03c6\u00a8n \u2212 \u03b5 [\u03c6n\u22121 \u2212 2\u03c6n + \u03c6n+1] = \u2212 sin(\u03c6n + \u03b8n) + \u03b3.(5.1)\nWhen there is no coupling, i.e., \u03b5 = 0, it can be seen immediately that there are in\ufb01nitely\nmany steady state solutions:\n\u03c6n =\n{\ncos(kn\u03c0) arcsin \u03b3 + kn\u03c0, n = 0,\u22121,\u22122, . . . ,\ncos(kn\u03c0) arcsin \u03b3 + (kn + 1)\u03c0, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\nwhere kn is an integer. The only monotone semikink is the solution with kn = 0 for n \u2208 Z;\nthus it is natural to identify this semikink with the type 1 semikink. However, it is less clear\nwhich solution would correspond to the type 2 and type 3 semikinks. Possible candidates for\nthe type 2 wave are solutions for which there is some N \u2208 N such that kn = 0 for n \u2264 0 and\nn \u2265 N and kn = 1 for 0 < n < N . Similarly, candidates for the type 3 wave are solutions\nfor which there is some N \u2208 N such that kn = 0 for n \u2264 \u2212N and n \u2265 0 and kn = 1 for\n\u2212N < n < 0. But there are many other candidates involving combinations of kn = 0 or\nkn = 1 as well. If one starts with such a wave in the uncoupled limit, i.e., with \u03b5 \u0004 1 or\na\u2192\u221e, and uses continuation to follow this wave in the discrete system (5.1) toward a = 0 or\n\u03b5\u2192\u221e, then it turns out that most waves end in a saddle-node bifurcation [3]. More details\nabout the continuation can be found in section 6.\nIn this section we will focus on the analytical study of the type 1 semikink for the coupling\nparameter \u03b5 small (thus the lattice spacing a large). We will denote this wave by \u03a61\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3),\nand for \u03b5 = 0, we have\n\u03a61\u03c0(n; 0; \u03b3) =\n{\narcsin \u03b3, n = 0,\u22121,\u22122, . . . ,\n\u03c0 + arcsin \u03b3, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\nThe existence of the continuation of (5.2) for small coupling \u03b5 is guaranteed by the following\nlemma.\nLemma 5.1. The steady state solution \u03a61\u03c0(n; 0; \u03b3), representing the semi\ufb02uxon of type 1 in\nthe uncoupled limit \u03b5 = 0, can be continued for \u03b5 small and \u03b3 < 1. It is given by\n\u03a61\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\narcsin \u03b3 +O(\u03b52), n \u2264 \u22121;\narcsin \u03b3 + \u03b5 \u03c0\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 +O(\u03b5\n2), n = 0;\n\u03c0 + arcsin \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b5 \u03c0\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 +O(\u03b5\n2), n = 1;\n\u03c0 + arcsin \u03b3 +O(\u03b52), n \u2265 2.\n(5.2)\nFor \u03b3 close to one, we write \u03b3 = 1\u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc.

The existence proof for \u03b3 < 1 follows from the implicit function theorem as given\nin [22, Theorem 2.1] or [25, Lemma 2.2].\nFor the case \u03b3 = 1\u2212\u03b5\u03b3\u02dc, the implicit function theorem as presented in the references above\ncannot be applied immediately. However, after some manipulations, the implicit function\ntheorem can be applied again. First we substitute into the steady state equation \u03b3 = 1\u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc\nand \u03a6 = \u03a60 +\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc, where \u03a60(n) =\n\u03c0\n2 for n \u2264 0 and \u03a60(n) = 3\u03c02 for n \u2265 1. This gives the\nfollowing equations:\n0 = cos(\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc(n))\u22121\n\u03b5 + \u03b3\u02dc \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5[\u03a6\u02dc(n\u2212 1)\u2212 2\u03a6\u02dc(n) + \u03a6\u02dc(n+ 1)] =: F\u02dcn(\u03a6\u02dc, \u03b5), n \u0006= 0, 1,\n0 = cos(\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc(0))\u22121\n\u03b5 + \u03b3\u02dc \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5[\u03a6\u02dc(\u22121)\u2212 2\u03a6\u02dc(0) + \u03a6\u02dc(1)]\u2212 \u03c0 =: F\u02dc0(\u03a6\u02dc, \u03b5), n = 0,\n0 = cos(\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc(1))\u22121\n\u03b5 + \u03b3\u02dc \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5[\u03a6\u02dc(0)\u2212 2\u03a6\u02dc(1) + \u03a6\u02dc(2)] + \u03c0 =: F\u02dc1(\u03a6\u02dc, \u03b5), n = 1.\nUsing that lim\u03b5\u21920\ncos(\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc(n))\u22121\n\u03b5 = \u221212(\u03a6\u02dc(n))2, the de\ufb01nitions for F\u02dc can be smoothly extended\nto \u03b5 = 0, too. The equations for \u03b5 = 0 become\n\u03a6\u02dc2(n) = 2\u03b3\u02dc, n \u0006= 0, 1; \u03a6\u02dc2(0) = 2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0); and \u03a6\u02dc2(1) = 2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0).\nFor |n| large, the wave should be asymptotic to the center point of the temporal dynamics;\nhence \u03a6\u02dc(n) = \u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc for |n| large. So for \u03b3\u02dc \u2265 \u03c0, there are two monotone semikinks (recall\nthat the full semikink is given by \u03a60 +\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc):\n\u03a6\u02dc\u00b1(n; 0; \u03b3\u02dc) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc, n \u2264 \u22121;\n\u00b1\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0), n = 0;\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0), n = 1;\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc, n \u2265 2.\nNote that the \u00b1-solutions collide for \u03b3\u02dc = \u03c0. The linearization DF\u02dc (\u03a6\u02dc\u00b1, 0) is invertible for\n\u03b3\u02dc > \u03c0; hence the implicit function theorem can be applied again and we have the existence of\nmonotone semikinks \u03a60(n) +\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc\u00b1(n, \u03b5, \u03b3\u02dc). In analogue with the continuum case, the type 1\nwave is the one that has the discontinuity at the lowest value of the phase. The critical bias\ncurrent for the existence of a static lattice semi\ufb02uxon follows immediately from the arguments\nabove.\n128 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nThe two \u00b1-solutions near \u03b3cr as derived above in the proof are like the type 1 and type 3\nsemi\ufb02uxons near \u03b3cr in the PDEs studied in the previous two sections. So in analogue to those\nPDEs, we can de\ufb01ne for \u03b3\u02dc > \u03c0\n\u03a61\u03c0(n; \u03b5; 1\u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) = \u03a60(n) +\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc\u2212(n; \u03b5; \u03b3\u02dc) and \u03a63\u03c0(n; \u03b5; 1\u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) = \u03a60(n) +\n\u221a\n\u03b5\u03a6\u02dc+(n; \u03b5; \u03b3\u02dc),\nwhere \u03a60 and \u03a6\u02dc\n\u00b1 are as in the proof above. Thus we get\n\u03a61\/3\u03c0 (n; \u03b5; 1\u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc +O(\u03b5), n \u2265 \u22121;\n\u03c0\n2 \u2213\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0) +O(\u03b5), n = 0;\n3\u03c0\n2 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0) +O(\u03b5), n = 1;\n3\u03c0\n2 \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc +O(\u03b5), n \u2265 2.\n(5.5)\nThe spectral stability of \u03a6i\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3) is obtained by substituting \u03c6n = \u03a6\ni\n\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3) + vne\n\u03bbt\nin the model equation (2.3). Disregarding the higher order terms in vn gives the eigenvalue\nproblem\nLi(\u03b5; \u03b3)\u03bd = \u039b\u03bd,(5.6)\nwhere \u039b = \u03bb2, \u03bd = ( . . . , v\u22121, v0, v1, . . . )T , and Li(\u03b5; \u03b3) is the linear discrete operator\nLi(\u03b5; \u03b3) =\n\u239b\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239c\u239d\n. . .\n. . .\n. . . 0\n\u03b5 \u22122\u03b5\u2212A\u22121 \u03b5\n\u03b5 \u22122\u03b5\u2212A0 \u03b5\n\u03b5 \u22122\u03b5\u2212A1 \u03b5\n0\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n\u239e\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u239f\u23a0 ,\nAn = cos\n(\n\u03a6i\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3) + \u03b8n\n)\n, n \u2208 Z.\nThis operator plays a similar role as the di\ufb00erential operator Li(x; \u03b3) = Dxx \u2212 cos(\u03c6i\u03c0(x; \u03b3) +\n\u03b8(x)) in section 3. The eigenvalue problem is an in\ufb01nite dimensional matrix problem for a\nreal and symmetric matrix. Thus the eigenvalues must be real.\nIn the discrete case, the continuous spectrum of semikinks is bounded. The spectrum is\nobtained by substituting vn = e\n\u2212ikn in (5.6) with J in = \u22122\u03b5\u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 from which one obtains\nthe following dispersion relation for such linear waves:\n\u039b = \u2212\n(\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + 4\u03b5 sin2(k2 )\n)\n.(5.7)\nThus the continuous spectrum consists of the intervals \u00b1i[ 4\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32,\n\u221a\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + 4\u03b5] (recall\nthat \u039b = \u03bb2).\nIn the following two lemmas we will show that all eigenvalues of the linearization L1(\u03b5; \u03b3)\nare negative for \u03b5 small. Thus for \u03b5 small, the type 1 wave is always stable. For \u03b3 = 1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc\nand \u03b3\u02dc > \u03c0, it can be shown that the linearization L3(\u03b5; 1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) has a positive eigenvalue for\n\u03b5 small. Hence the type 3 wave is unstable for \u03b3 near \u03b3cr and with \u03b5 small.\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 129\nLemma 5.2. For 0 < \u03b3 < 1 and \u03b5 small, the largest eigenvalue of the operator L1(\u03b5; \u03b3) is\nnegative up to O(\u03b52).\nProof. The eigenvalue problem to calculate the stability of the monotone discrete \u03c0-kink\n\u03c61\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3), n \u2208 Z, is given by (5.6) with i = 1. Slightly modifying Baesens, Kim, and\nMacKay [2], the spatially decaying solution that corresponds to an eigenvalue of the above\neigenvalue problem can be approximated by\nvn =\n{\nc\u000f\u2212n, n \u2264 0,\nc\u02c6 c\u000fn\u22121, n \u2265 1,(5.8)\nfor some c, c\u02c6, and |\u000f| < 1. The diagonal elements in L1(\u03b5; \u03b3) are An =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + O(\u03b52),\nif n \u0006= 0, 1, A0 =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 \u2212 \u03b5 \u03b3\u03c0\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 + O(\u03b5\n2), and A1 =\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + \u03b5 \u03b3\u03c0\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 + O(\u03b5\n2). Thus\nA0 \u0006= A1; hence we need two parameters c and c\u02c6 (modifying [2], where c\u02c6 = \u00b11 following from\nthe symmetry A0 = A1).\nFor small nonzero \u03b5, if we can match exponentially decaying solutions (5.8) on both sides\nfrom either end of the lattice to a central site, then we obtain a candidate for an eigenfunction.\nWith (5.6), the parameters \u000f and c\u02c6 will be determined up to order \u03b5. For n \u0006= 0, 1, the relation\n(5.6) gives up to order \u03b5\n\u039b = \u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + \u03b5 (\u000f\u2212 2 + 1\t ) .(5.9)\nAt the central sites n = 0, 1 we get up to order \u03b5\n\u039b = \u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + \u03b5 \u03b3\u03c0\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 + \u03b5(\u000f\u2212 2 + c\u02c6);(5.10)\n\u039b = \u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 \u2212 \u03b5 \u03b3\u03c0\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 + \u03b5\n(\n\u000f\u2212 2 + 1c\u02c6\n)\n.(5.11)\nCombining (5.9), (5.10), and (5.11) shows that there are two possible values for c\u02c6, being\nc\u02c6\u00b1 = \u2212 \u03c0\u03b3\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 \u00b1\n\u221a\n1+(\u03c02\u22121)\u03b32\u221a\n1\u2212\u03b32 +O(\u03b5), and leads to the eigenvalue \u039b and the decay exponent \u000f\nas a function of \u03b5 and \u03b3; i.e.,\n\u000f\u00b1 = \u00b1\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32\u221a\n1 + (\u03c02 \u2212 1)\u03b32 +O(\u03b5),(5.12)\n\u039b\u00b1 = \u2212\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + \u03b5\n\u000f\u00b1\n(\u000f\u00b1 \u2212 1)2 +O(\u03b52).(5.13)\nGeneral Sturm\u2013Liouville theory states that a critical eigenfunction that corresponds to\nthe largest eigenvalue of a continuous eigenvalue problem does not vanish, except probably at\nx\u2192 \u00b1\u221e. This theorem can also be extended to a discrete eigenvalue problem such that the\nmost critical eigenvector does not have sign changes [1]. Thus, if we have a solution of the\nform (5.8) with \u000f > 0, then it is the critical eigenvector.\nFrom (5.12), we see that \u000f+ > 0; thus the largest eigenvalue \u039b+ from (5.13) is in the gap\nbetween zero and the interval associated with the continuous spectrum, i.e., \u039b+ < 0.\nRemark 5.3. From the details in the proof, note that weak coupling with strong bias\ncurrent leads to one additional eigenvalue associated with \u000f\u2212, where \u000f\u2212 < 0 and |\u000f\u2212| < 1. This\n130 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nindicates that the eigenvector of the form (5.8) is localized but has out of phase con\ufb01guration,\ni.e., has in\ufb01nitely many sign changes. This is a typical characteristic of a \u201chigh-frequency\u201d\neigenvalue which is con\ufb01rmed by the fact that \u039b\u2212 is indeed smaller than the phonon band. The\npresence of a high-frequency eigenvalue of a kink was previously reported by Braun, Kivshar,\nand Peyrard [6] in their study of the Frenkel\u2013Kontorova model with the Peyrard\u2013Remoissenet\npotential [26].\nFor \u03b3 close to 1, i.e., \u03b3 = 1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc, with \u03b3\u02dc > \u03c0, both the type 1 and the type 3 waves as\ngiven in (5.5) can be analyzed. In the following lemma we also show that both types have a\nhigh-frequency eigenvalue.\nLemma 5.4. For \u03b3 = 1\u2212\u03b5\u03b3\u02dc, with \u03b3\u02dc > \u03c0, the largest eigenvalue of the operator L1(\u03b5; 1\u2212\u03b5\u03b3\u02dc)\nis strictly negative and the largest eigenvalue of the operator L3(\u03b5; 1\u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) is strictly positive.\nProof. As before, we write for an eigenfunction\nvn =\n{\nc\u000f\u2212n, n \u2264 0,\nc\u02c6 c\u000fn\u22121, n \u2265 1,\nfor some c, c\u02c6, and |\u000f| < 1, and we substitute this in the eigenvalue problem, which leads to\nthe equations\n\u039b = \u2212 sin\n(\u221a\n\u03b52\u03b3\u02dc +O(\u03b5)\n)\n+ \u03b5(1\/\u000f\u2212 2 + \u000f);(5.14)\n\u039b = \u2213 sin\n(\u221a\n2\u03b5(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0) +O(\u03b5)\n)\n+ \u03b5(\u000f\u2212 2 + c\u02c6);(5.15)\n\u039b = \u2212 sin\n(\u221a\n2\u03b5(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0) +O(\u03b5)\n)\n+ \u03b5(\u000f\u2212 2 + 1\/c\u02c6),(5.16)\nwhere the \u2213-sign in the second equation is a minus sign for the eigenvalue problem associated\nwith the type 1 wave and a plus sign in case of the type 3 wave. Again, by subtracting (5.16)\nfrom (5.15), we get a quadratic equation for c\u02c6, with two solutions, one of order 1\u221a\n\u03b5\nand one of\norder\n\u221a\n\u03b5 (which is most easily found by writing the equation as a quadratic equation for 1c\u02c6 ):\n1\nc\u02c61\n= 1\u221a\n\u03b5\n(\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0)\u2213\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0) +O(\u221a\u03b5)\n)\n;\nc\u02c62 =\n1\u221a\n\u03b5\n(\n\u2212\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0)\u00b1\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0) +O(\u221a\u03b5\n)\n.\nCombining (5.14) and (5.15), respectively, (5.16), and using the two expressions above give\nthat in both cases \u000f is of order\n\u221a\n\u03b5 and is given by\n1\n\t1\n= 1\u221a\n\u03b5\n(\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc \u2213\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0) +O(\u221a\u03b5)\n)\n;\n1\n\t2\n= 1\u221a\n\u03b5\n(\u221a\n2\u03b3\u02dc \u2212\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0) +O(\u221a\u03b5\n)\n.\nFinally, substitution into (5.14) shows that\n\u039b1 = \u2213\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc \u2212 \u03c0) +O(\u03b5);\n\u039b2 = \u2212\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n\u221a\n2(\u03b3\u02dc + \u03c0) +O(\u03b5).\n(5.17)\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 131\nThe eigenvalue that corresponds to \u000f > 0 is \u039b1.\nSo clearly the largest eigenvalue \u039b1 is negative in case of the type 1 wave and is positive\nin case of the type 3 wave.\nIn addition, the operators L1(\u03b5; 1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) and L3(\u03b5; 1 \u2212 \u03b5\u03b3\u02dc) have the same high-frequency\neigenvalue \u039b2 (up to order \u03b5\n2).\nThe proofs of Lemmas 5.2 and 5.4 show the presence of a high-frequency eigenvalue for a\nsemikink in case the bias current is not small. In the following we will show that the eigenvalue\nappears when the bias current is larger than\n\u221a\n\u03b5+O(\u03b5).\nBecause we do not have an analytic expression for the type 2 and type 3 semikinks in the\nsmall forcing limit, the analysis is done only for the type 1 semikink.\nLemma 5.5. There is a critical value \u03b3hf , \u03b3hf =\n\u221a\n\u03b5+O(\u03b5), such that for all \u03b3 \u2208 (\u03b3hf , \u03b3cr)\nthe operator L1(\u03b5; \u03b3\u02c6) has a high-frequency eigenvalue that up to O(\u03b53) is attached to the lowest\nboundary of the continuous spectrum. The corresponding eigenvector is localized and changes\nsign between any two adjacent sites.\nThe appearance of this eigenvalue and the structure of its eigenvector is checked numeri-\ncally in section 6.\nProof.

It follows from a straightforward analysis that this eigenvalue\nexists, i.e., \u000f\u2212 \u2208 (\u22121, 0) exists, for all \u03b3 \u2208 (\u03b3hf , \u03b3cr), and the corresponding eigenvalue is\n\u039b\u2212 = \u22121 + ( \u03b3\u02c622 \u2212 4)\u03b5 + \u03b3\u02c64\/8\u03b52 + O(\u03b53). Up to O(\u03b53) this eigenvalue is nothing else but the\nlower boundary of the continuous spectrum.\n6. Numerical computations of the discrete system. To accompany our analytical results,\nwe have used numerical calculations. For that purpose, we have made a continuation program\nbased on a Newton iteration technique to obtain the stationary kink equilibria of (2.3) and\n(2.4) and an eigenvalue problem solver in MATLAB. To start the iteration, one can either\nchoose the continuum solutions discussed in section 3, i.e., the case where the lattice spacing\nparameter a = 0, or trace the equilibria from the uncoupled limit \u03b5 = 0 (a\u2192\u221e) as discussed\nin the previous section. We use the number of computational sites 2N = 800 for parameter\nvalues of a = 0.05 or larger (\u03b5 = 20 or lower).\n132 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H.

The bold solid line is the calculated approximate function for the point spectrum using perturbation\ntheory for a small, respectively, for \u03b5 small.\n6.1. Stability of type 1 lattice semi\ufb02uxon. The type 1 lattice semi\ufb02uxon \u03a61\u03c0(n; \u03b5; 0),\nn \u2208 Z, has been studied analytically both in the strong coupling limit (a \u0004 1, or \u03b5 \u0012 1)\nand the weak coupling limit (a \u0012 1, \u03b5 \u0004 1). In Figure 6(a), \u03a61\u03c0(n; \u03b5; 0) is plotted for two\ndi\ufb00erent values of the coupling parameter \u03b5. For a given value of \u03b5, one can use as an initial\nguess in the numerical procedure a solution either from the continuous limit (3.10) or from\nthe uncoupled limit that has been discussed in the preceding sections.\nIn Figure 6(b), we present the numerically calculated spectrum of the type 1 semi\ufb02uxon\nwith \u03b3 = 0 as a function of the lattice spacing parameter. The approximate largest eigenvalue\n(4.9), derived for a small, and the one derived in Lemma 5.2 for a large, are in good agreement\nwith the numerically obtained largest eigenvalue. Any eigenvalue below \u039b = \u22121 belongs to the\ncontinuous spectrum. For a close to zero we do not see dense spectra because of the number\nof sites we used. By increasing the site number we will obtain a more dense spectrum.\nThere is only one eigenvalue outside the phonon bands\u2014the largest eigenvalue as studied\nin Lemma 5.2. This is in contrast to the case of an ordinary lattice 2\u03c0-kink [16, 19] where\nthere is an internal mode bifurcating from the phonon band when the parameter a increases.\nIf Figure 6(b) shows the spectrum of the type 1 semi\ufb02uxon as a function of the coupling\nparameter \u03b5 (\u03b5 = 1\/a2) for a \ufb01xed bias current \u03b3, in Figure 7 we present the numerically\ncalculated spectrum of the type 1 lattice semi\ufb02uxon as a function of \u03b3 for a \ufb01xed \u03b5, \u03b5 = 0.25.\nLemmas 5.2 and 5.5 established the existence of two eigenvalues (for \u03b5 small enough)\nfor the stability problem associated to the type 1 semi\ufb02uxon, the largest eigenvalue, and\nan additional eigenvalue which bifurcates from the lower edge of the phonon band for bias\ncurrent \u03b3 > \u03b3hf . It follows from the numerical simulations that these are indeed the only two\neigenvalues (Figure 7). For \u03b5 = 0.25, this minimum bias current \u03b3hf is approximately 0.466.\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 133\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u22121\n\u22120.8\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.4\n\u22120.2\n0\n\u03b3\n\u039b\n(a)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u22121.02\n\u22121.01\n\u22121\n\u22120.99\n\u22120.98\n\u22120.97\n\u22120.96\n\u22120.95\n\u03b3\n\u039b\/\n((1\n\u2212\u03b3\n2 )1\n\/2\n+\n4\u03b5\n)\n(b)\nFigure 7.

Shown are the eigenvector of (a) the largest eigenvalue,\n(b) the second one, and (c)\u2013(d) the last two eigenvalues. There is only one eigenvalue for L1(\u03b5; \u03b3) as there is\nonly one localized eigenvector.\nInterestingly, according to Lemma 5.5 the bifurcation appears at \u03b3hf =\n\u221a\n\u03b5 = 0.5 at leading\norder in \u03b5. This is in remarkably good agreement with the numerical result, especially since\nthe error is O(\u03b5) and \u03b5 = 0.25.\nTo picture the appearance of the high-frequency eigenvalue, all eigenvalues for the trun-\ncated 2N\u00d72N -matrix associated with L1(\u03b5; \u03b3) are determined and the eigenvectors of the two\nlargest eigenvalues and the two smallest eigenvalues are presented in Figures 8\u201310 for various\nvalues of \u03b3 and a \ufb01xed \u03b5. It can be observed that there is always a localized eigenfunction\nassociated with the largest eigenvalue.

Note also that neighboring sites of the eigenvector in (d) move out of phase, indicating a\nhigh-frequency mode, contrary to the semikink\u2019s low-frequency mode in (a).\neigenfunction associated with the smallest eigenvalue can be observed.\nIf we keep increasing \u03b3 further, then there is a critical applied bias current at which the\nlargest eigenvalue becomes 0. Numerical computations show that this critical value is \u03b3cr(\u03b5),\nabove which static lattice semi\ufb02uxons disappear.\nThe critical bias current for the existence of a static type 1 lattice semi\ufb02uxon in the\ncontinuum limit and for a very weak coupling in the discrete system were discussed and\nanalytical expressions were given in sections 3, 4, and 5, respectively. In Figure 11, the\nnumerically calculated critical bias current \u03b3cr of the discrete system (2.3) as a function of the\nlattice spacing a is presented. The approximate functions, given in (4.2) for small a, and in\n(5.4) for large a (small \u03b5), are presented as dashed lines.\n6.2. Instability of type 2 lattice semi\ufb02uxon. In the continuum models we have seen that\nfor \u03b3 small, the instability of the type 2 semikink is mainly determined by the instability of\nthe 3\u03c0-kink in the continuum models for \u03b3 = 0. So we start this section by looking at the\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 135\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n0.6\n0.65\n0.7\n0.75\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\n1\na\n\u03b3 c\nr\nno static semifluxons \nstatic semifluxons \nFigure 11. The critical bias current of a static \u03c0-kink as a function of the lattice spacing parameter a.\nFor \u03b3 above the critical current there is no static \u03c0-kink solution. The solid line is a numerically obtained\ncurve. Dashed lines are the theoretical predictions (4.2) for a\u0004 1, respectively, (5.4) for a\u0006 1 (\u03b5\u0004 1).\nstability of the 3\u03c0-kink in the discrete model. We will denote the 3\u03c0-kink by \u03a623\u03c0(n; \u03b5; 0),\nwhere as before the coupling parameter \u03b5 and the lattice spacing a are related by \u03b5 = 1\na2\n.\nUsing our continuation program, we have followed a 3\u03c0-kink solution from the continuous\nlimit 0 < a\u0004 1 up to the uncoupled situation \u03b5 = 0 (i.e., a =\u221e). We obtain that \u03a623\u03c0(n; 0; 0)\nis given by\n\u03a623\u03c0(n; 0; 0) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n0, n = \u22121,\u22122, . . . ,\n2\u03c0, n = 0,\n\u03c0, n = 1,\n3\u03c0, n = 2, 3, . . . .\n(6.1)\nNote that this discrete con\ufb01guration is not monotonically increasing, as opposed to the con-\ntinuum con\ufb01guration, which is monotonic.\nIn Figure 12, we present the numerically obtained eigenvalues of a 3\u03c0-kink as a function\nof the lattice spacing a. For small a, the largest eigenvalue is indeed increasing as is predicted\nby the perturbation theory (4.10). As soon as the lattice spacing is of order one, the largest\neigenvalue decreases and becomes zero at approximately a = 1.7521.\nAfter establishing that increasing the lattice spacing can stabilize the 3\u03c0-kink at \u03b3 = 0,\nwe continue by looking at the stability of the 2\u03c0-kink for \u03b3 > 0. Interestingly, increasing the\nlattice spacing does not stabilize a type 2 semikink for \u03b3 > 0. In Figure 13, we show a plot of\nthe type 2 semikinks for two values of \u03b5 as well as a plot of the largest eigenvalue as a function\nof \u03b5 for two particular values of \u03b3, namely, \u03b3 = 0.01 and \u03b3 = 0.1. We present the largest\neigenvalue as a function of the coupling \u03b5 instead of the lattice spacing a as the eigenvalue\nchanges most for small coupling (large lattice spacing). From Figure 13 it follows that the\nsolutions are unstable even in the weak-coupling limit. This is interesting as in the limit for\n\u03b3 \u2192 0, the type 2 semikink can be seen as a concatenation of a 3\u03c0-kink and a \u22122\u03c0-kink. Both\nthe 3\u03c0-kink and \u22122\u03c0-kink are stable for the coupling \u03b5 su\ufb03ciently small, while the type 2\nsemikink turns out to be unstable.\n136 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A.

If we look only at sites numbered n = 6\nto n\u2192 \u2212\u221e, \u03a62\u03c0(n; 0; \u03b3) can be seen as a deformed 3\u03c0 lattice kink (at site n = 0, the phase \u03a6\ntakes the value \u03c0 instead of the value 2\u03c0 as in the 3\u03c0-kink). Hence, it seems that coupling\nbetween the two kinks due to the presence of a nonzero \u03b3 is responsible for the instability.\nIt has been discussed in the previous sections that there is a critical bias current \u03b3\u2217 for\nthe existence of a type 2 lattice semikink in the continuum models. However, we did not\nnumerically calculate the critical bias current \u03b3\u2217(a) for discrete system (2.3).\n6.3. Instability of type 3 lattice semi\ufb02uxon. In this section, we will consider the type 3\nsemikinks, which will be denoted by \u03a63\u03c0(n; \u03b5; \u03b3). In Lemmas 3.9 and 4.7 it has been shown\nthat these kinks are unstable in the continuum models for small or zero lattice spacing.\nThe largest eigenvalue of a lattice type 3 semi\ufb02uxon for three particular values of \u03b3, i.e.,\n\u03b3 = 0.01, 0.1, 0.55, is presented in Figure 14. Even though in the limit for \u03b3 \u2192 0, a semi\ufb02uxon\nof this type is a concatenation of a 2\u03c0-kink and a \u2212\u03c0-kink which can both be stable in the\ndiscrete system, the type 3 semikink is unstable for all parameter values from the zero lattice\n138 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A. VAN GILS, AND H. SUSANTO\nspacing limit all the way to the zero coupling one. The explanation is similar to the one for\na type 2 semikink discussed above.\nIndeed, for the three particular choices of \u03b3 above, \u03a63\u03c0(n; 0; \u03b3) is given by\n\u03a63\u03c0(n; 0; 0.01) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n0 + arcsin(0.01), n = \u22121,\u22122, . . . ,\n\u03c0 \u2212 arcsin(0.01), n = \u22126,\n2\u03c0 + arcsin(0.01), n = \u22125, . . . , 0,\n\u03c0 + arcsin(0.01), n = 1, 2, . . . ,\n(6.4)\n\u03a63\u03c0(n; 0; 0.1) =\n\u23a7\u23aa\u23aa\u23a8\u23aa\u23aa\u23a9\n0 + arcsin(0.1), n = \u22121,\u22122, . . . ,\n\u03c0 \u2212 arcsin(0.1), n = \u22122,\n2\u03c0 + arcsin(0.1), n = \u22121, 0,\n\u03c0 + arcsin(0.1), n = 1, 2, . . . ,\n(6.5)\nand\n\u03a63\u03c0(n; 0; 0.55) =\n\u23a7\u23a8\u23a9\n0 + arcsin(0.55), n = \u22121,\u22122, . . . ,\n\u03c0 \u2212 arcsin(0.55), n = 0,\n\u03c0 + arcsin(0.55), n = 1, 2, . . . .\n(6.6)\nOne interesting point to note for the type 3 semikink is that the number of sites with value 2\u03c0\nis decreasing as \u03b3 increases. Starting from the continuum approximation of a type 3 semikink\nas the initial guess for the continuation program, the 2\u03c0-plateau disappears for \u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3\u2217(a) (see\n(4.1)). For \u03b3 > \u03b3\u2217 the con\ufb01guration at \u03b5 = 0 is similar to the stable type 1 \u03c0-kink (5.2), apart\nfrom the value of the phase at the site with n = 0 (where the phase takes the value of an\nunstable \ufb01xed point).\nBecause analytical calculation of the spectrum of the type 3 semikink has been obtained in\nthe small coupling limit and bias current close to 1 (5.17), it is worth comparing the analytical\npredictions with numerical computations. The theoretical calculations show that for \u03b5 small\nand \u03b3 close to 1, the type 3 semikink has at least two eigenvalues, one of which corresponds\nto a high-frequency mode and the other to a positive eigenvalue.\nUsing the continuation of (6.6) for \u03b5 = 0.25, the spectrum of the type 3 lattice semikink\nis presented in Figure 15 as a function of the applied bias current \u03b3. Our numerics show\nthat when \u03b3 is very close to \u03b3cr, the type 3 semikink has three eigenvalues, one of which\ncorresponds to a high-frequency mode and is below the phonon band, while the other two are\nabove the phonon band. The birth of this high-frequency mode is shown in Figure 15(c) and\nis qualitatively similar to the case of the type 1 lattice semikink. The two eigenvalues which\nexist for all values of \u03b3 can be observed in Figure 15(a) and (b).\n7. Conclusions. We have performed an existence and stability analysis for three types\nof lattice \u03c0-kink solutions of the discrete 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation and its continuum limits.\nAnalytical results have been established in the continuum limits and in the weak-coupling\ncase. It has been shown that in the continuous 0-\u03c0 sine-Gordon equation, \u03c0-kinks of type 1\nare stable and the other types are unstable. The introduction of discreteness destabilizes the\nunstable \u03c0-kinks even more. An approximation to the largest eigenvalue of all types of \u03c0-kinks\nhas been derived both in the continuum and the weak coupling limits.\nSTABILITY ANALYSIS OF \u03c0-KINKS 139\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\u22122\n\u22121.5\n\u22121\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\n1\n\u03b3\n\u039b\n(a)\n0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75\n\u22121.01\n\u22121\n\u22120.99\n\u22120.98\n\u22120.97\n\u22120.96\n\u22120.95\n\u03b3\n\u039b\/\n(1\u2212\n\u03b32\n)1\/\n2\n\u221250 0 50\n0\n0.2\n0.4\nn\nv n\n\u03b3=0.73\n(b)\n0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75\n\u22121.02\n\u22121.015\n\u22121.01\n\u22121.005\n\u22121\n\u22120.995\n\u22120.99\n\u03b3\n\u039b\/\n((1\n\u2212\u03b3\n2 )1\n\/2\n+\n4\u03b5\n)\n\u221250 0 50\n\u22120.5\n0\n0.5\nn\nv n\n\u03b3=0.73\n(c)\nFigure 15. Spectrum of the type 3 semi\ufb02uxon as a function of the applied bias current \u03b3 for a value of the\ncoupling constant \u03b5 = 0.25. In (b) and (c) we zoom in near the phonon band for clarity. In (b), the spectrum\nis normalized to the upper edge of the phonon band, i.e.,\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32, and in (c) it is normalized to the lower\nedge of the phonon band, i.e.,\n\u221a\n1\u2212 \u03b32 + 4\u03b5. The disappearance of a high-frequency mode in the lower edge of\nthe phonon band can be clearly observed in (c). The insets in (b) and (c) show the eigenfunctions of the two\neigenvalues just above, respectively, just below, the phonon band for \u03b3 = 0.73.\nFor future research, it is of interest to study the nucleation of kinks and antikinks when a\nconstant force, or bias current, \u03b3, that is above the critical value \u03b3cr is applied\u2014see Figure 2(b).\nOne question that can be addressed is the mechanism and the frequency of the nucleation as\na function of the applied constant force, especially in the presence of a damping coe\ufb03cient\n(which has not been considered in this paper). In work in progress, the stability of the\ntype 3 semi\ufb02uxons in the presence of defects is studied. These semi\ufb02uxons are unstable,\nbut the largest eigenvalue is close to zero. In fact, a type 3 semi\ufb02uxon consists of a \ufb02uxon\nand a semi\ufb02uxon with the opposite polarity. In experiments, the presence of a \ufb02uxon near\na semi\ufb02uxon can in\ufb02uence a junction measurement [12]. Because a \ufb02uxon can be pinned by\na defect [17, 18], one can expect to have a stable type 3 semi\ufb02uxon when there is a defect\npresent in the system.\n140 G. DERKS, A. DOELMAN, S. A.
