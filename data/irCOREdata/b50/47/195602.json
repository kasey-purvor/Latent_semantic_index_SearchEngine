What is ELISA detecting? \nMarcus S. Cooke \n \nRadiation and Oxidative Stress Section, \nDept. Cancer Studies and Dept. Genetics,  \nRobert Kilpatrick Clinical Sciences Building,  \nUniversity of Leicester. LE2 7LX, UK. \ne-mail: msc5@le.ac.uk \n \nAccepting the caveats concerning possible confounding influence from diet and cell \ndeath [1], the measurement of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2019-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG, or 8-OH-dG) \nin urine is thought to provide a non-invasive assessment of whole body oxidative stress.  This \nrepresents a number of advantages over other possible biomarkers of oxidative stress.  The \nnon-invasive nature of the assay make it less of an ethical issue than, for example, blood-\nbased assessments of oxidative stress, in particular when sampling from vulnerable groups is \nrequired.  Many of the issues of adventitious damage, associated with the study of cellular 8-\noxodG [2], are circumvented by analysis of urine.  Urine is easily collected and transported.  \nNo special storage conditions are required, for example no preservatives are necessary, with \n8-oxodG reported to be stable in urine, at \u2013 20 \u00b0C, for over 10 years [3], making previously \ncollected samples eminently suitable for analysis.  Such urinary biomarkers can therefore be \nused in both prospective and nested, case-control molecular epidemiology studies [4]. \nFor the most part, methods that have been applied to the analysis of oxidatively \ndamaged DNA lesions have been based upon chromatography (principally, HPLC-MS\/MS; \nliquid chromatography pre-purification prior to GC-MS, HPLC-GC\/MS, HPLC-EC, GC-MS \n[5]).  However, a significant number of reports in the literature use competitive enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and in particular the commercially available kit from \nthe Japanese Institute for the Control of Aging (JaICA), although use of \u2018custom made\u2019 \nELISAs has also been reported [6-8].  The benefits of ELISA are (i) ease of use; (ii) no \nspecialist (or indeed expensive) equipment is required; (iii) potential application to numerous \nextracellular matrices (serum [9], plasma [10], saliva [11, 12], urine [13], CSF [14, 15], cell \nculture medium [16-18] and sputum [19], in contrast to the, to date, rather limited repertoire \nof matrices analysed by chromatographic techniques, with the exception of that reported by \nBogdanov et al. [20] ; (iv) other than centrifugation of cloudy specimens, no pre-treatment of \nurine is required (v) high throughput. \nHowever, there exists major criticisms of ELISA concerning (i) lack of perfect \ncorrelation with established chromatographic techniques, and (ii) apparent over-estimation of \nbackground levels of urinary 8-oxodG in healthy individuals.  Whilst correlations have been \ndemonstrated between the ELISA and chromatographic techniques e.g. r = 0.46 [21], rs = \n0.56 [22], (both) p< 0.001 vs. HPLC-ECD; and r= 0.73, p = 0.002 vs. HPLC-GC\/MS [23] \nthese have been far from 1:1 and statistical significance is not always achieved [24].  \nDifferences in mean urinary 8-oxodG levels can vary anywhere from four- to ten-fold \nbetween ELISA and chromatographic techniques.  Overall, this does suggest that both \ntechniques share a common analyte, with the ELISA perhaps recognising additional \ncompounds, and as a consequence a number of groups have been actively trying to address \nthis the issue of discrepancy.  For example, improvements by the manufacturer of the JaICA \nkit (narrowing calibration curve range; recommendation for strict temperature control), have \nreduced the margin in background levels between the two approaches.  More recently, further \nimprovements have been noted, following overnight incubation of the primary antibody at 4 \n\u00baC [25]. \nData concerning the antigens recognised by the primary antibody of the JaICA kit \n(denoted N45.1) suggest the antibody to be highly specific for 8-oxodG [26].  This, in part, \nderives from recognition of the hydroxylated C8 position of Gua, it would appear to \ndiscriminate the C6 carbonyl group of 8-oxoGua (and C2 NH2), from the C6 amino group of \n8-oxoAde.  Furthermore, the closest competitors, other than 8-oxodG, for the antibody is 8-\noxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxodGMP [25], the former of which needs to \nbe present in concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than 8-oxodG, in order to \ncompete to the same extent [26], a situation that does not appear to occur in vivo [27].  It is \nunknown whether 8-oxodGMP is present in urine.  Toyokuni et al. [26] also reported that \nother endogenous constituents, present at high concentrations, in urine, such as uric acid, urea \nand creatinine, show no cross-reactivity with the antibody. \nIn this issue of Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Song et al. [28] demonstrate that \nurea is, in fact, one of the major contributors to the over-estimation of urinary 8-oxodG by \nELISA.  The authors\u2019 approach to better understand the reactivity of N45.1 is to fractionate a \nhuman urine sample, and to test aliquots of these fractions for reactivity in the ELISA.  The \nfirst eluting ELISA-positive fractions was, using retention time as a guide, surmised to \ncontain urea and allantoin, the second fraction contained 8-oxodG.  Both urea and allantoin \nwere then screened in the ELISA, with urea demonstrating competition with 8-oxodG for \nantibody binding.  This raises the question \u2018why this was not noted during antibody \ncharacterisation?\u2019.  In the work of Song et al. [28], a urea concentration of 10-80 mg\/mL was \nused, levels similar to that seen in human urine.  In contrast, the concentrations used during \nthe characterisation of N45.1 were four orders of magnitude lower than that present in human \nurine, explaining the apparent lack of reactivity [26].  This raises the possibility that urease \ntreatment of urine, prior to ELISA may bring the results into closer agreement with a \nchromatographic approach.  Indeed, this does appear to be the case.  The authors also \nexploited a recent development in which performing the JaICA ELISA kit\u2019s primary antibody \nstep at 4 \u00baC, rather than 37 \u00baC, improved the agreement between ELISA and LC-MS\/MS \n[25].  This further decreased the recognition of urea by N45.1, and demonstrated the most \nsignificant correlation with HPLC-EC, to date (r = 0.98; p < 0.0001).  The authors conclude \nthat other, as yet unidentified, cross-reacting substances may be present in urine, which \naccount for the remaining disagreement with chromatographic techniques.  They also note \nthat, in their study, only a 7-fold greater concentration of 8-oxoGuo is required to compete \nfor 8-oxodG, unlike the previous reports of one or two orders of magnitude [25, 26]. \n Identifying the basis of the discrepancy between ELISA and chromatographic \nassays has proven to be problematic, but some progress has been made [25].  The report of \nSong et al. [28] has further added to our understanding of the discrepancy between ELISA \nand chromatographic method, and hence indicated possible ways to further improve the \nELISA.  Nevertheless, there still remains a discrepancy, even with urease pre-treatment, or \nlow temperature incubation of the primary antibody.  Further work is clearly required, not \nleast to further validate the use of these methodological improvements, before ELISA can be \nrecommended, without comparison with established chromatographic methods, for the \nspecific measurement of urinary 8-oxodG.   \n \nAcknowledgements \n MSC is a partner of ECNIS (Environmental Cancer Risk, Nutrition and Individual \nSusceptibility), a network of excellence operating within the European Union 6\nth\n Framework \nProgram, Priority 5:\"Food Quality and Safety\" (Contract No 513943).
