Wright\n(darren.wright@ion.le.ac.uk)\n1 Introduction\nThe artificial modification of the Earth\u2019s ionosphere was first\nnoted in the 1930s when newly built broadcast radio sta-\ntions began operations. Radio signals propagating through\nthe region of the ionosphere modified by the high power ra-\ndio waves were influenced through a cross modulation ef-\nfect (Tellegen, 1933; Bailey and Martyn, 1934). The first\npurpose-built high power transmitters (or heaters), intended\nfor ionospheric studies, appeared in the 1970s and the first re-\nported ionospheric modification (heating) experiments were\nperformed at Platteville, Colorado. These experiments re-\nvealed that the high power \u201cpump\u201d wave led to the genera-\ntion of field-aligned electron density irregularities (FAIs; Fi-\naler, 1974; Minkoff et al., 1974). The FAIs are excited as a\nresult of the coupling of the pump wave to a type of elec-\ntrostatic plasma waves known as upper hybrid (UH) waves\nwhich occur in a narrow altitude region around the upper hy-\nbrid height. These UH waves cause an enhancement in the\nelectron temperature, hence the term \u201cheating\". After sev-\neral tens of seconds the electron density in the active region\nincreases due to the temperature dependence of the recom-\nbination. However, in the upper F-region (about \u223c200 km)\nother processes can also lead to density depletions (Gurevich,\n1978; Ashrafi et al., 2006). Detailed discussions on the exci-\ntation of FAIs and other heater-induced phenomena are given\nin the reviews by Robinson (1989) and Stubbe (1996). Once\nthey exist, the heater-induced FAI provide intense and coher-\nent targets for HF radars such as CUTLASS, which receive\nbackscatter from field-aligned electron density irregularities\n(e.g. Robinson, 1997).\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n2624 D. M. Wright et al.: Excitation thresholds of field-aligned irregularities\nNp\nP (dB)\nFigure 1\nFig. 1. A theoretical curve showing the relationship between\nanomalous absorption and heater power (solid curve). The dashed\nlines show the different paths that lead to the hysteresis effect.\nCurrent theory suggests that the FAI are generated by the\nthermal parametric instability (TPI). There are two regimes\nof the TPI which relate to soft and hard excitation, depend-\ning on whether initial density perturbations are infinitesimal\nor finite respectively (e.g., Istomin and Leyser, 1997). The\nformer regime corresponds to the thermal oscillating two-\nstream instability (TOTSI; e.g. Grach et al., 1978; Dysthe\net al., 1983) while the latter regime is the resonance instabil-\nity reported by Vaskov and Gurevich (1977). The nonlinear\nstage of the soft regime resembles the resonance instability.\nThe TOTSI is a well-known theory for the creation and rapid\ngrowth of FAIs and one which readily explains the radar ob-\nservations (e.g. Robinson, 1997).\nInitially, the TOTSI causes a linear conversion of elec-\ntromagnetic pump wave energy into upper hybrid waves\n(Vaskov and Gurevich, 1977; Dysthe et al., 1983; Robin-\nson, 1988). This coupling requires the presence of plasma\ndensity gradients (pre-existing FAIs) and leads to an increase\nin the FAI amplitude. Once this amplitude exceeds a thresh-\nold value (typically after a few milliseconds) the interaction\nbecomes nonlinear and the irregularity amplitude increases\nexplosively. A simple heuristic (or fitting) model (Dysthe et\nal., 1983; Robinson, 1989) leads to a relationship between\nthe pump power, P , and the level of anomalous absorption,\n0, experienced by the pump wave, given by\nP\n[\ne\u22120\/2 1\u2212(cosh(0\/2)\u22121)(lna)\/pi\nP1\n+0e\n(00\u22120)\/4\n00P2\n]\n=1, (1)\nwhere P1 and P2, respectively, are the required power thresh-\nolds for the initial and explosive stages of FAI growth, 00 is\nthe level of anomalous absorption before the heater was ac-\ntivated and a is a factor relating to the field parallel scale\nlength of the FAIs (see Robinson, 1989). The two terms in\nEq. (1) represent the initial and explosive instabilities. Since\nanomalous absorption 0\u221d n2, where n is the FAI amplitude,\nthen irregularity saturation as governed by Eq. (1) is illus-\ntrated as the solid curve in Fig. 1 in which 0 is plotted as a\nfunction of P .\nHysteresis effects in the ionospheric plasma are a conse-\nquence of a thermal parametric instability such as the TOTSI\n(e.g. Grach et al., 1978). The existence of hysteresis was con-\nfirmed by the ionospheric modification experiments at Gorkii\nin Russia reported by Erukimov et al. (1978) and subse-\nquently by Stubbe et al. (1982) and Jones et al. (1983) using\nthe heating facility at Troms\u00f8. A hysteresis effect occurs in\nthe generation of FAI because a threshold power, Pt , (shown\nin Fig. 1) required for the onset of FAI growth is higher than\nthe critical pump power, Pc, at which the FAI can no longer\nbe sustained and, hence, collapse. The effective threshold\npower is given by\nPt = P1P2\nP1+P2 , (2)\nwhere Pt is larger than both P1 and P2. So, once the heater\npower P >Pt then the FAI form explosively and saturation\nis rapid. This is demonstrated in Fig. 1 by the path ABCD.\nIf the pump power is then steadily reduced, the FAI do not\ncollapse until P <Pc, therefore following path DEFA.\nThis paper concerns the excitation and hysteresis of FAI\ninduced by the SPEAR (Wright et al., 2000; Robinson et al.,\n2006) high power heating facility, located on Spitsbergen.\nSince SPEAR is the most northerly heating facility in the\nworld, these observations have never been possible before at\nthese very high latitudes (75\u25e6 N geomagnetic, L\u223c 15). Sim-\nilar experiments have been undertaken at lower latitudes. In\nparticular, this study will compare observations over SPEAR\nwith those in the vicinity of the EISCAT Heater near Troms\u00f8,\nNorway (66\u25e6 N geomagnetic, L \u223c 6.6), and presented by\nWright et al. (2006). It will be shown that FAIs can be\nartificially excited using very low effective radiated powers\n(ERPs) from SPEAR. Hysteresis effects are clearly observed\nin the CUTLASS radar backscatter from both Troms\u00f8 and\nSPEAR. However, stark differences are apparent in the inco-\nherent scatter measurements provided by the EISCAT UHF\nradars.\n2 Instrumentation\n2.1 The SPEAR high power facility\nSPEAR (Space Plasma Exploration by Active Radar; Wright\net al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2006) is a facility capable of ra-\ndiating high power radio waves in the high frequency (HF)\nband in the range 4\u20136 MHz. It was deployed on the is-\nland of Spitsbergen (in the Svalbard archipelago) at a geo-\ngraphic latitude of 78\u25e6 N (75\u25e6 N geomagnetic; L\u223c 15) and\nAnn.

First\noperations occurred in 2003. SPEAR utilises direct digital\nsynthesis (DDS) technology to be able to point its beam in\nany direction essentially instantaneously. It currently em-\nploys a 4\u00d76 array of rhombically broadened dipole antennas\nand possesses a frequency-dependent beam width which is\napproximately 14\u25e6\u00d721\u25e6 wide with a gain of 21 dBi (Wright\net al., 2000). During the experiment described in this pa-\nper, SPEAR was operated at a frequency of 4.45 MHz with\nO-mode polarisation and stepped its power output up to a\nmaximum ERP of 10 MW. The SPEAR beam was directed\nalong the magnetic field.\nO-mode polarised radio waves radiated by SPEAR are ca-\npable of interacting with the ionospheric plasma and can\ncouple to upper hybrid waves, as described above, to excite\nFAI. When the ionosphere is underdense, the radio waves\nradiated by SPEAR can also interact with plasma deeper in\nthe magnetosphere. In addition, SPEAR operates not only as\nan ionospheric heating facility but also possesses a receiving\nsystem and can thus also function as a radar.

The signals returned to the\nradars have undergone a Bragg-like backscattering process\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2623\/2009\/ Ann. Geophys., 27, 2623\u20132631, 2009\n2626 D. M.

There is an aspect-angle de-\npendence for scattering, which requires that the radio wave k\nvector is close to orthogonal to the magnetic field. The ex-\nperiments described here utilise the SPEAR high power HF\nHeating facility which can generate artificial field-aligned ir-\nregularities as described earlier and thus provide a region of\nbackscatter in the CUTLASS fields of view (e.g. Robinson et\nal., 1997) when backscatter may not already be present.

The detection of\nartificial backscatter by HF radar then provides a powerful\nway of diagnosing plasma processes (e.g. Robinson et al.,\n1997) and observing geophysical phenomena (e.g. Yeoman\net al., 1997).\nDuring the experiments relevant to this paper, the CUT-\nLASS radars operated in \u201cstereo\u201d mode where, by utilising\nsome of the radar\u2019s spare duty cycle, each radar was able\nto simultaneously sound over two different scan patterns.\nThese are shown on the maps illustrated in Fig. 3.

During this experiment, however, the\nradars were sounding over reduced regions, the blue and red\nfields of view indicating the two scan patterns. Only data\nfor the red fields of view (centred over SPEAR) are con-\nsidered in this paper. The first range sounded on both the\nHankasalmi and \u00deykkvib\u00e6r radars was 1485 km. SPEAR\nlies at approximately 1800 km from the Hankasalmi radar\nand about 1900 km from \u00deykkvib\u00e6r. The dwell (integration)\ntime on each radar beam was 1 s for Hankasalmi and 2 s for\n\u00deykkvib\u00e6r. Each radar scanned over 5 beams in the red field\nof view and employed a three frequency scan mode during\nthis experiment. Thus the final time resolution of the radar\ndata for a single beam and a narrow frequency band (12.3\u2013\n12.6 MHz for all the data shown here) is 15 s for Hankasalmi\nand 30 s for \u00deykkvib\u00e6r.

Wright et al.: Excitation thresholds of field-aligned irregularities 2627\n2.3 The EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR)\nThe EISCAT Svalbard radar system (ESR; Wannberg et al.,\n1997) is collocated with SPEAR and was used to detect\nSPEAR-enhanced incoherent radar backscatter from which\nplasma parameters, such as electron concentration and ion\nand electron temperatures, may be derived. The ESR oper-\nates at frequencies close to 500 MHz and is therefore sen-\nsitive to 30 cm wavelength plasma waves. On 10 October\n2006, the ESR ran an experimental mode that used the steer-\nable 32 m dish (pointed field-aligned, i.e. with a geographic\nazimuth of 182.1\u25e6 and a geographic elevation of 81.6\u25e6) to\ncollect ion line data using long pulses. Although the ion\nline spectra were obtained on two channels with transmit-\nter frequencies of 499.9 and 500.3 MHz, only data from the\n499.9 MHz channel have been presented in this paper. The\nheight-discriminated ion line data, which had a temporal res-\nolution of 5 s, were obtained over an altitude range of 86\u2013\n481 km with a resolution of approximately 28 km.\n3 Observations\nOn 10 October 2006 SPEAR was operated such that its out-\nput power was increased stepwise up to an ERP of 10 MW\nand then stepped back down. The power, with respect to\n10 MW, was varied from\u221210 dB to 0 dB and back to\u221210 dB\nin 2 dB steps with a dwell of 1 min at each power level. This\ncycle was repeated several times. A gap of four minutes\nwas left between cycles to prevent the preconditioning of\nthe ionosphere from influencing subsequent measurements.\nA complete cycle, including off period, thus lasted 15 min.\nFigure 4 shows range-time-intensity (RTI) plots of the re-\nceived backscatter power at \u00deykkvib\u00e6r (upper panel) and\nHankasalmi (lower panel) during the experiment. The data\npresented are for the radar beams which overlie SPEAR and\nthe ESR. At the beginning of the interval shown SPEAR was\noperated a few times at full power for a few minutes on then\noff in order to identify the SPEAR-induced backscatter in the\nCUTLASS radars in real time. Then, at 11:19 UT the first of\nseven consecutive power-stepping cycles commenced. The\nbackscatter were detected by both CUTLASS radars simulta-\nneously although the SPEAR-induced scatter at Hankasalmi,\nwhich appear as the patches of higher intensity in the plots,\nwere embedded in a region of weak natural scatter. Hence,\nthe rest of this paper will focus on the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r data where\ninterpreting the weakest returns is more straightforward. Re-\nproduced in the top panel of Fig. 5 are the \u00deykkvib\u00e6r data\nduring one of the cycles, selected since it is one of the clear-\nest and simplest examples. The vertical coloured stripe im-\nmediately before 12:43 UT is most likely caused by noise\nor interference in the radar data. The lower panel shows\nthe SPEAR output ERP relative to the maximum power of\n10 MW. The patch of scatter can clearly be seen to inten-\nsify as the SPEAR output increases and then fall again as\nexpected. However, with respect to the peak SPEAR out-\nput the observed shape and intensity of the patch of artifi-\ncial scatter is clearly asymmetric. This is indicative of iono-\nspheric hysteresis, where the backscatter intensity is higher\nfor the power-down cycle than for the power-up cycle at the\nsame SPEAR output power. Essentially, SPEAR has pre-\nconditioned the ionosphere prior to the down-going part of\nthe power cycle. The two vertical dashed lines are placed in\nan attempt to indicate the cut-offs of the scatter observed by\nthe radar. Pt is related to the power threshold for the explo-\nsive excitation of the SPEAR-induced irregularities. It can\nbe seen that Pt occurs at about 8 dB below the maximum\n(equivalent to an ERP of about 1.6 MW). It seems that the\nthreshold power to prevent collapse of the irregularities (Pc)\nwas below the minimum power (\u223c1 MW) employed during\nthis experiment. It should be noted that the CUTLASS radars\nmay be desensitised to very weak backscatter returns as a re-\nsult of absorption losses along the\u223c4000 km radio wave path\nbetween the radar and target and back again. If observed lo-\ncally, the power thresholds might actually be smaller.\n4 Discussion\nWright et al. (2006) reported results from a series of power-\nstepping experiments which were undertaken in 1997 using\nthe Troms\u00f8 heating facility in conjunction with the EISCAT\nmainland UHF radar and CUTLASS. The programme was\ndesigned to investigate power thresholds for the creation of\nFAIs and the associated ionospheric hysteresis. The findings\nof Wright et al. (2006) will be used for comparison with the\nobservations presented here. Following the commissioning\nphase of SPEAR, it was decided to run similar experiments\nto those using the Troms\u00f8 heater in order to assess the nature\nof FAI formation at very high latitudes.\nThe power-stepping experiments which took place in\nTroms\u00f8 in 1997 demonstrated that artificial FAI could be\nexcited with relatively low heater output powers and that\nhysteresis played a role in maintaining them. However, the\nTroms\u00f8 heater had a maximum ERP of 155 MW during those\nexperiments and was configured such that the smallest power\nincrement available was 3.9 MW. Wright et al. (2006) could\nonly conclude that the power thresholds Pt and Pc were less\nthan 3.9 MW. In 2006, SPEAR operated such that it em-\nployed a finer step-size during the experiment. The results\npresented here strongly indicate that the threshold for creat-\ning the artificial FAI (Pt ) lies in the range 1.0\u20131.6 MW. Once\ncreated, the FAI can be maintained with much weaker pow-\ners. Indeed the true value of Pc was still outside of the res-\nolution of this experiment. It is only possible to say that\nPc < 1 MW. The marked difference between Pt and Pc is\ncaused by the irregularity density function given in Fig. 1.\nThe electric field, E (V\/m), generated by a heater with an\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2623\/2009\/ Ann.

(3)\nThe heater interaction altitude (at which the FAI are excited),\nR, was determined to be 158 km for this experiment (see\nbelow). Hence the threshold ERP, Pt , of 1 MW equates to\na threshold electric field, Et , of 50 mV\/m. This is slightly\ngreater than predicted thresholds (e.g. Istomin and Leyser,\n1997).\nWhen SPEAR was constructed concerns were raised that\nthe maximum ERP achievable, being only \u223c10% of the\nheater at Troms\u00f8, might not be adequate to artificially excite\nFAI. Not only was that shown not to be the case by Robin-\nson et al. (2006) but the results presented here also indicate\nthat SPEAR ERPs of only 1\/30th of its nominal maximum\ncapability can excite the FAIs. Thus SPEAR offers an oppor-\ntunity to study the formation of FAIs on fine power scales. In\naddition, forthcoming experiments will attempt to ascertain\nthe true value of Pc.\nUnderstanding the observed ionospheric hysteresis util-\nising SPEAR is far less straightforward. To examine the\nobserved hysteresis, the CUTLASS radar backscatter pow-\ners from the centre of each heated patch (the patches move\nslightly within the radar field of view as a result of natural\nionospheric variability along the radar radio wave path) have\nbeen separated into up- and down-going parts of the cycle\nand plotted as a function of SPEAR ERP. Figure 6 shows\nthe average effect over all seven cycles. This clearly demon-\nstrates that ionospheric hysteresis is influencing the CUT-\nLASS radar measurements since the power at a given ERP\nis higher on the down-going part of the cycle as a result of\nthe preconditioning of the ionosphere over SPEAR. These\nobservations are very similar to those presented by Wright et\nal. (2006) following the Troms\u00f8 experiments except that for\nthe current study the difference in the up- and down-going\npower levels is significantly smaller. The largest difference\nin powers observed in Fig. 6 is 5 dB whereas at Troms\u00f8 that\ndifference was nearer 20 dB at equivalent ERPs. Since the\ntwo experiments were conducted at similar points in the so-\nlar cycle then perhaps it is likely that the preconditioning in-\nflicted on the ionosphere by the Troms\u00f8 heater was much\ngreater (due to the order of magnitude difference in maxi-\nmum ERP of the two facilities) than that caused by SPEAR.\nFor comparison with the setup employed for this study, the\nexperiments at Troms\u00f8 utilised a heater operated with an O-\nmode polarisation at a frequency of 4.544 MHz with its beam\npointing along the field line. The maximum effective radi-\nated power (ERP) on these occasions was 155 MW and the\ninteraction (or UH) height was identified by the UHF radar\nto be in the altitude range 180\u2013200 km (Wright et al., 2006).\nThe backscatter detected by the CUTLASS radars indi-\ncate that a hysteresis effect is observed and that, perhaps,\nthe same mechanism is responsible for exciting the artifi-\ncial FAIs both over Svalbard and over the Norwegian main-\nland. However, incoherent scatter radar measurements taken\nwithin the heated volumes over SPEAR and over the Troms\u00f8\nheater are very different. Figure 7 is reproduced from Wright\net al. (2006) and shows a typical example of hysteresis iden-\ntified in ionospheric electron temperatures within the heated\nvolume observed over Troms\u00f8 using the EISCAT UHF radar,\nover a height range which encompasses that where the artifi-\ncial FAI are generated (the upper-hybrid height, as identified\nusing the ion-line overshoot effect; e.g. Rietveld et al., 2000).\nSimilar hysteresis was observed in changes in electron den-\nsity induced by the heating effect. In contrast with these\nmeasurements, Fig. 8 illustrates the modified electron den-\nsity (upper panel) and electron temperatures (lower panel) as\nobserved by the ESR within the heated volume over SPEAR.\nThe plotted data represent measurements averaged over all\nseven SPEAR cycles at the interaction height (i.e. the ap-\nproximate height at which the FAI were being excited), iden-\ntified by the ESR to be 158 km. The changes in electron\ntemperature and density plotted in Figs. 7 and 8 are rela-\ntive to the measured values immediately before each heater\ncycle commenced. The data are again separated into those\nrecorded during the up-going and down-going parts of the\nSPEAR power cycle. The averaged data are representative\nof the measurements over each individual cycle and demon-\nstrate that no hysteresis was observed.\nThe reason why the ESR measurements are so strikingly\ndifferent to those at Troms\u00f8 (despite the fact that the CUT-\nLASS radar scatter suggest that the FAI are exhibiting hys-\nteresis effects) is unclear. It is true to say that incoherent\nscatter radars detect signals from very different structures to\nthose to which the coherent radars are sensitive. Also, the\nAnn.

The temperature change of the electrons in the ionosphere\nmodified by the Troms\u00f8 heater normalised by and plotted as a func-\ntion of the heater output power. Again the up- and down-going parts\n(respectively symbolised by 1 and +) of the heater cycle are over-\nlaid to illustrate the hysteresis effect (reproduced from Wright et al.,\n2006).\nESR transmit frequency is only half that of the mainland\nUHF radar. However, it seems unlikely that either of these\npoints can explain the differences.\nOther experiments undertaken utilising the ESR and\nSPEAR have also noted contrasts between the measurements\ntaken at the two locations (e.g. Robinson et al., 2006). A\nrelevant example of this is apparent in the time evolution of\nthe parametric decay instability (PDI). At Troms\u00f8, when the\npump wave is activated, the radio waves interact linearly with\nLangmuir wave modes which exist close to the reflection\nheight of the pump wave. This initially leads to a large sig-\nnal intensification observed in the ion line spectra observed\nby the EISCAT UHF radar. Shortly afterwards the ther-\nmal oscillating two-stream instability (TOTSI) is believed to\nexplosively excite FAI at the upper hybrid (UH) height (be-\nlow the pump wave reflection height). The FAIs then act to\nabsorb the pump wave energy before it can reach the reflec-\ntion height and thus the PDI signal is quenched. This is often\ncalled the overshoot effect. However, during SPEAR experi-\nments on Svalbard it has been noted (Robinson et al., 2006)\nthat the PDI signal sometimes persists for long periods and\neven indefinitely. However, the CUTLASS radar measure-\nments indicate the presence of irregularities. Perhaps this in-\ndicates that the density of the artificial FAI has not saturated\nor is, indeed, small. In either case, the \u201canomalous\u201d action\nFigure 8\nFig. 8. Electron density (upper panel) and electron temperature\n(lower panel) measurements of the local ionosphere made using the\nESR during the SPEAR power stepping experiment on 10 October\n2006. Here the data have been averaged over all seven power cy-\ncles and are presented for the heater interaction altitude of 158 km.\nThe vertical black lines represent the errors bars associated with the\nmeasurements.\nof the PDI over Svalbard may be consistent with the lack of\nobserved hysteresis in the ESR measurements.\nThe saturated magnitude of heater-induced density stria-\ntions cannot exceed a few percent (Gurevich et al., 1995) and,\nif the UH damping is linear, the saturated effective amplitude\nof the trapped UH waves should roughly be proportional to\nthe pump amplitude.

However, below 200 km inelastic losses\nbecome significant in limiting 1Te, especially at low heater\nERP. Thus, a 30 km difference in altitudes between the ESR\nand Troms\u00f8 UHF radar observations (as is the case in this\nwww.ann-geophys.net\/27\/2623\/2009\/ Ann.

It seems unlikely that FAIs at\n158 km and low ERP would have reached saturation in mag-\nnitude. In addition, 1Te could be so small that it might not\nbe detected by the ESR.\n5 Conclusion\nThe SPEAR high power radar performed a power stepping\nexperiment to investigate the properties of the ionospheric\nplasma over Spitsbergen, Norway. The high power ra-\ndio waves excited artificial field-aligned irregularities (FAIs)\nwhich were then monitored by both CUTLASS radars and\nthe EISCAT Svalbard Radar (ESR). It has been demonstrated\nthat SPEAR is capable of exciting FAIs with an effective ra-\ndiated power of only 1 MW, representing only 1\/30th of the\nfacility\u2019s nominal maximum output. Once the FAI are ex-\ncited they are easily maintained and the threshold for col-\nlapse of the FAI was found to be less than 1 MW but beyond\nthe range of the experiment undertaken. The determination\nof this parameter will be the subject of a future experiment.\nCUTLASS measurements indicated clear hysteresis in\nthe artificially excited FAIs in that the received backscatter\npower from these intense ionospheric targets was higher for\nthe power-down part of the cycle than for power-up. This\nagrees with observations previously made utilising the EIS-\nCAT heating facility at Troms\u00f8. However, incoherent scat-\nter radar measurements made with the ESR and the UHF\nradar at Troms\u00f8 appear radically different. Over Svalbard,\nno hysteresis was observed and the measured electron den-\nsities and electron temperatures appeared chaotic within the\nheated volume. This is in stark contrast with observations\nover Troms\u00f8. Although this effect has been noted in other\ntypes of experiment, the reason for the difference is, as yet,\nunclear and is the subject of further investigation. It has been\npostulated that this might be the result of different physical\nprocesses dominating the ionospheric interactions in the two\nregions, which underlie very different magnetospheric mor-\nphologies.\nAcknowledgements.
