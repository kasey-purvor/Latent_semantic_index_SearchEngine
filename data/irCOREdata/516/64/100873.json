The piezoelectric po-\nlarization, which has a magnitude comparable to the sponta-\nneous polarization, induces a significant redshift of the lumi-\nnescence lines of GaN\/AlN QD heterostructures. Therefore,\nthe knowledge of the strain distribution in QDs is essential to\nunderstand the emission wavelength and to expect to tune\nthis wavelength to the desired application.\nDespite the large number of reports on the growth and\/or\noptical\/structural characterization of wurtzite GaN\/AlN QD,\nonly a few theoretical studies address the strain state of these\nnanostructures.3,4 From the experimental viewpoint, Raman\nspectroscopy measurements5 provide information on the av-\nerage strain of the GaN and AlN in the structures, indicating\nthat the QDs are almost completely strained by the matrix,\nand the AlN is under a slight tensile strain. Anomalous\ngrazing-incident x-ray diffraction experiments resolve two\nstrain states in the AlN matrix6 but the results were not\ncompared to detailed elastic calculations.\nIn this letter, we investigate the two-dimensional strain\ndistribution in vertically correlated GaN QD structures em-\nbedded in an AlN matrix by combining experimental data\nfrom high-resolution transmission electron microscopy\n\u0001HRTEM\u0002 with elastic theoretical calculations.\nWurtzite GaN\/AlN QD superlattices \u0001SLs\u0002 with metal\npolarity, were grown on a 6H\u2013SiC substrate by plasma-\nassisted molecular beam epitaxy in a MECA2000 chamber\nequipped with standard effusion cells for Al and Ga.

Wright.12 Different in-\nplane distances between the GaN QDs, varying between 10\nand 20 nm, were considered, without significant effect on the\nobtained results.\nStrain results were expressed using two different defini-\ntions of strain depending on the applied method. The GPA\nmeasures strain with respect to a reference area in the HR-\nTEM image following the expressions:\nezz\nGPA\u0001r\u0002 =\nc\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 cref\ncref\n; exx\nGPA\u0001r\u0002 =\na\u0001r\u0002 \u2212 aref\naref\n, \u00011\u0002\nwhere c\u0001r\u0002 and a\u0001r\u0002 are the lattice parameters at the pixel r\nof the HRTEM image, and cref and aref are the values aver-\naged on the reference region of the image.

Table I summarizes the aver-\nage values of GPA and material strains in the main areas of\nthe structures. In both directions, we notice the good agree-\nment between the experimental and calculated GPA strain\nvalues. The strain extracted from HRTEM images are aver-\naged over the sample thickness. Therefore, the presence of\nthe matrix around the QD might result in an underestimation\nof the lattice parameters in the GaN QDs, particularly in the\ntop and the facet areas. However, in the SL under study,\nthe sample thickness is similar to the QD base diameter\n\u0001\t30 nm\u0002. As a consequence, the influence of the matrix in\nour measurements should not be significant.\nFor the interpretation of the results, lets us recall that, in\nwurtzite layers under biaxial stress, the relation between the\nin-plane strain and the strain along the c axis is given by the\nPoisson modulus: ezz \/exx=\u22122C13\/C33 \u0001\u22120.58 for AlN and\n\u22120.51 for GaN\u0002. We notice that the GaN WL roughly follows\na biaxial deformation, which is not the case for the GaN in\nthe QDs due to the compressive hydrostatic stress imposed\nby the AlN matrix. Indeed, in our TEM image in Fig. 3\u0001b\u0002,\nwe observe that the GaN in the QDs is completely strained\non the AlN barriers in the a direction, while in Fig. 2\u0001b\u0002 we\nobserve a slight compression of the c axis. Experimental val-\nues in GaN are slightly lower than calculated values. This is\ndue to the faint relaxation of the stress at the free surface\npresent in a TEM sample.\nRegarding the AlN spacers, we observe two different\nstrain states corresponding to the AlN situated between WLs\n\u0001almost fully relaxed\u0002 and the AlN spacers between vertically\ncorrelated QDs \u0001under tensile strain\u0002. An indication of the\nmagnitude of the lateral stress induced by the QDs is the fact\nthat the deformation of the AlN is not biaxial either between\nthe QDs or between WLs. It is important to notice that the\nmodulation in the AlN lattice parameters is not due to any Ga\nTABLE I.

Redistribution subject toAll of these strain measurements demonstrate that the\ndominant mechanism responsible for the vertical correlation\nof GaN\/AlN QDs is the inhomogeneous strain in the AlN\nmatrix, and neither Ga\u2013Al interdiffusion nor the presence of\nthreading dislocations. This vertical correlation mechanism\nhas been described theoretically by Tersoff et al.13 It also\nexplains the vertical alignment for the case of the Ge\/Si QD\nsystem, whereas in the InAs\/GaAs QD system the inhomo-\ngeneous strain in the GaAs matrix has sometimes been at-\ntributed to In diffusion.14 In our case, EFTEM experiments\nexcluded such a possibility.\nIn conclusion, using HRTEM measurements in combina-\ntion with theoretical calculations, the strain distribution in a\nGaN\/AlN QD SL has been investigated. The GaN WL\nroughly follows a biaxial deformation, which is not the case\nfor the GaN in the QDs due to the compressive hydrostatic\nstress imposed by the AlN matrix. We have experimentally\nidentified the mechanism responsible for the vertical correla-\ntion of GaN\/AlN QDs, which is the local strain induced in\nthe AlN matrix by the presence of dots.\nThanks to Dr. P.
