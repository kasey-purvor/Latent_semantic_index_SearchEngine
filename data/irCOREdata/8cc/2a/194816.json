The extreme luminosity of\nthe prompt gamma-ray emission means that GRBs can be detected,\nif they exist, to very high redshifts, with minimal extinction by in-\ntervening gas or dust. This makes them potentially very powerful\nindicators of star formation to early times.\nTo date, spectroscopically confirmed redshifts have only been\npublished for about three dozen bursts, although various schemes\nhave been suggested to derive redshifts empirically from gamma-ray\nproperties, such as the lag\u2013luminosity (Norris, Marani & Bonnell\n2000) and variability\u2013luminosity relations (Reichart et al. 2001).\nThese studies suggest that the redshift distribution of GRBs is\nbroadly consistent with the emerging picture of the comoving star\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1074 N. R. Tanvir et al.\nformation rate in the Universe having peaked sometime around\nredshifts 1\u20134, although uncertainties ramp up at higher redshifts\n(e.g. Lloyd-Ronning, Fryer & Ramirez-Ruiz 2002; Ramirez-Ruiz,\nTrentham & Blain 2002).\nThese results are interesting, but premature to the extent that we\nhave limited knowledge of these luminosity correlations, and only\nrudimentary understanding of the relationship between the GRB\nrate and star formation rate (e.g. Krumholz, Thorsett & Harrison\n1998). For instance, there is the possibility that the GRB rate and\/or\nbrightness depends also on other factors, such as metallicity, galac-\ntic environment, and certainly on any variations in the stellar initial\nmass function (IMF). These are difficult factors to disentangle, but\nimportant insights can be gained by comparing GRB rate with the\nstar formation rate estimated by other means. Our programme is\naimed at providing a more quantitative comparison of the star for-\nmation rate deduced by GRBs and that obtained from submillimetre\n(submm) luminosity, through direct study of the host galaxies of\nGRBs.\nExisting methods of mapping the star formation history of the\nUniverse rely on estimating the star formation rates of individual\ngalaxies, and summing these up in redshift bins with some esti-\nmated correction for galaxies below the detection threshold (e.g.\nAdelberger & Steidel 2000), or by modelling the redshift distribu-\ntion so as to fit integrated backgrounds (e.g. Blain et al. 1999a).\nIf GRBs reliably trace star formation, and we can quantify the re-\nlationship, then ultimately detection of their host galaxies will not be\nrequired for the purposes of mapping global star formation history.\nNone the less, GRB hosts also uniquely allow us to study the star-\nforming galaxy luminosity function right to the faint end. An upshot\nmay be a means to estimate the proportion of the total star formation\nwhich is going on in infrared (IR)-bright, dusty galaxies, optically\nbright galaxies and in fainter populations which are not selected in\nother surveys (e.g. Trentham, Ramirez-Ruiz & Blain 2002). To date,\nthe best example of the power of GRB selection to probe the faintest\nend of the galaxy luminosity function is GRB 020124, whose host\ngalaxy is undetected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to R =\n29.5 (Berger et al. 2002). This galaxy would not have been found\nin any direct imaging survey to date and yet observations of the\nafterglow show that the host has a high H I column density (making\nit a damped Ly\u03b1 absorber) and a redshift of z = 3.20 (Hjorth et al.\n2003b).\n1.2 Mapping star formation in the submm\nThe power of submm studies for mapping the star formation history\nof the Universe is discussed in detail by Blain et al. (2002) and Smail\net al. (2002). Briefly, in dusty systems ultraviolet (UV) radiation,\npredominantly from massive stars, is reprocessed by the dust and\nemitted in the far IR. This emission, which itself is unaffected by\ndust extinction, is thus proportional to the obscured star formation\nrate. At higher redshifts the peak of emission moves increasingly\ninto the submm, with the beneficial consequence that at 850 \u00b5m\nthe apparent luminosity of a galaxy of given intrinsic bolometric\nluminosity changes little from redshift z \u2248 0.5 out to z \u2248 10.\nSubmm surveys, combined with constraints from the intensity\nand spectrum of IR backgrounds, show that compared to the local\nUniverse, the majority of high-redshift star formation appears to\nbe taking place in dusty systems (Blain et al. 1999a), and much\n(although not the dominant part) of this in so-called ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies (ULIRGs: with IR luminosities\u0001 1012 L\u0005). Low-\nredshift ULIRGs exist, but have around 1000 times lower comoving\nspace density (Smail et al. 2002).\nPotential drawbacks with submm surveys are: (a) At the 2 mJy\nconfusion limit of SCUBA only about 30 per cent of the total submm\nbackground emission from COBE-FIRAS observations is resolved\nout. (b) Any individual galaxy may suffer some contamination of its\n850-\u00b5m luminosity through heating from an obscured active galac-\ntic nucleus (AGN). Only about 10 per cent of submm galaxies with\ndeep X-ray data appear to show evidence for a hard X-ray AGN\n(Almaini et al. 2003), but larger samples and deeper observations\nwill be necessary to confirm this fraction. (c) It is necessary to as-\nsume or constrain the shape of the far-IR spectral energy distribution\n(SED) at wavelengths shorter than 850 \u00b5m in order to translate the\nmeasured submm flux density into an accurate luminosity and star\nformation rate. The luminosity inferred from a galaxy with a cer-\ntain SED depends only weakly on redshift; however, without direct\nknowledge of the details of the SED this luminosity is uncertain,\nleading to ambiguity in the results. A certain fractional change in\nthe dust temperature leads to a fractional uncertainty in the inferred\nluminosity that is greater by several times (Blain et al. 2002; Blain,\nBarnard & Chapman 2003). While results are so far generally con-\nsistent with dust temperatures of order 35 K (Chapman et al. 2003a),\nthe extent of the distribution of values is not yet known.\nRedshifts for large samples of submm galaxies were for a long\ntime hard to obtain, because of the lack of both bright optical coun-\nterparts (frequently I > 26), and the poor 15-arcsec spatial resolu-\ntion of SCUBA at 850 \u00b5m. However, Chapman et al. (2003b, see\nalso Ivison et al. 2002) have demonstrated that about 65 per cent of\nsubmm galaxies brighter than 5 mJy are detected in very deep Very\nLarge Array (VLA) radio maps, providing accurate subarcsec posi-\ntions. Redshifts for around 40\u201350 per cent of these radio-detected\nsubmm galaxies can be obtained using Keck LRIS spectra (Chap-\nman et al. 2003a). Based on these results they find a range of redshifts\nfrom 0.8 to 2.8 with a median of 2.4, and conclude it is likely that\nmost submm galaxies lie at redshifts between 2 and 3. The radio\nselection could be biased to lower redshifts, and to sources contain-\ning AGN; however, the reasonable \u000640 per cent completeness of\nthe redshift determinations of Chapman et al. suggests that these\neffects are not too significant.\nOn the other hand, in a recent study of the evolution of the global\nstellar mass density 0 < z < 3 based on an infrared-selected sample\nof galaxies from the Hubble Deep Field North, Dickinson et al.\n(2003) report that while the star formation rate essentially tracks that\ndetermined in other wavebands at low redshifts, the rate at z > 2 is\nsignificantly different. These observations appear to be inconsistent\nwith scenarios in which the bulk of stars in present-day galactic\nspheroids formed at z \u0007 2, since most of the stars (50\u201375 per cent)\nof the present-day stellar mass density formed by z \u223c 1 and in fact\nby z = 2.7 only 3\u201314 per cent of today\u2019s stars were present. The\nissue is clearly not settled.\nCurrent sensitivities and confusion limits imply that substan-\ntially fainter submm samples will not be studied in detail until the\nALMA interferometer is commissioned in 2012. Hence, an alter-\nnative method to probe the star formation in obscured galaxies is\ndefinitely required, and GRB source counts and host galaxy stud-\nies may ultimately be able to tell us both when and where this star\nformation occurred.\n1.3 Pros and cons of GRBs as star formation indicators\nSeveral characteristics of GRBs lend them to probing high-redshift\nstar formation. (a) They are bright enough to be seen to z \u223c 20 (e.g.\nLamb & Reichart 2000). (b) They can be detected in gamma-rays\nthrough large columns of dust and gas. (c) They can be detected\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 1073\u20131080\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nSubmillimetre properties of GRB host galaxies 1075\nindependently of whether a host galaxy can be found. Furthermore,\nmuch information relating to the host, such as redshift, metallicity,\ngas column density and extinction can all be obtained indirectly,\nfrom afterglow observations \u2013 either optically or X-ray. (d) The\nspectral slopes of both prompt and afterglow emission compensate\nto some extent for redshift dimming, and time dilation means that\nobservations can be made earlier in the rest-frame time than would be\nthe case for lower redshifts (e) being produced by individual massive\nstars, they are obviously unaffected by AGN contamination.\nOn the downside, GRBs are rare, their progenitors are still not\nfully understood and they are not very useful for telling us about the\nstar formation rate in individual galaxies. In terms of the current ob-\nservational state-of-play, samples of GRBs, particularly those with\nfirm redshifts, are very inhomogeneous \u2013 the result of a wide vari-\nety of triggers and followup campaigns. One consequence is that,\nof the roughly 200 entries to-date in Jochen Greiner\u2019s web table1\nof \u2018well-localized\u2019 bursts, fewer than 25 per cent have optical af-\nterglows identified. However, only a minority of those 200 were\nreported within 24 h, and had error circles <10 arcmin in diameter.\nAlso, many were not well placed for optical observation, have only\nshallow limits, or in some cases no reported optical followup at all.\nThus, the superficially high rate of \u2018dark\u2019 GRBs is misleading. The\nproportion of genuinely dark GRBs (a reasonable working definition\nwould be R > 23.5 at 24 h post-burst; see also Section 2) amongst\nthe HETE and BeppoSAX triggers is probably only 10\u201330 per cent.\nThe wide variation in GRB followup campaigns makes it hard to\nquantify selection effects, but selection effects may well be impor-\ntant for our study. To be found optically, an afterglow should not\nbe in too dusty an environment. A low-redshift illustration of this\nissue is provided by Mannucci et al. (2003), who find an enhanced\ncore-collapse supernova rate in K-band monitoring of nearby star-\nforming galaxies, but still conclude that the large majority of su-\npernovae remain undetected due to very high extinction. In fact, for\nGRBs this conclusion is not as inevitable as it sounds because the\ninitial flux of high-energy photons from GRBs is expected to destroy\ndust possibly up to \u223c100 pc (e.g. Fruchter, Krolik & Rhoads 2001c;\nGalama & Wijers 2001). In some cases this will be enough to create\na window through otherwise obscuring dust clouds. Of course, if\nmost star formation in the Universe is occurring in the \u2018obscured\nmode\u2019, then dust destruction may actually be a requirement to ex-\nplain the large number of afterglows detected optically. Even when\noptical afterglows are not found to faint limits, as we shall argue be-\nlow, it is not necessarily the case that they are heavily enshrouded in\ndust. None the less, it would be surprising if some fraction of GRB\nafterglows were not missed because they were highly extinguished.\nDetected afterglows are unlikely to be found in very low-density\nenvironments, even if GRBs occur there, since the brightness of the\nspectral peak reduces with the density of the ambient medium (Sari,\nPiran & Narayan 1998). The high H I column densities seen towards\nmany bursts (e.g. Galama & Wijers 2001; Hjorth et al. 2003b) are\nconsistent with this expectation, although Reichart & Price (2002)\nsuggest that for the limited sample of dark bursts available, the\ncolumn densities are not consistent with them being in the nuclear\nregions of ULIRGs either.\nObservational limitations are also likely to introduce a bias against\nfinding high-redshift GRBs. Although the spectral slope and cos-\nmological time-dilation work so as to reduce the effect of redshift\non the magnitude of an afterglow at a given observer time after the\nburst (another kind of negative k-correction), GRBs of comparable\n1 http:\/\/www.mpe.mpg.de\/\u223cjcg\/grbgen.html\nintrinsic luminosity will still appear fainter at higher redshift, mak-\ning them and their afterglows harder to discover. For example, Hogg\n& Fruchter (1999) adopted a (1 + z)\u22121 dependence for the probabil-\nity that a burst at a given redshift is detected and an optical afterglow\nfound. Of course, z \u0001 7 objects will be essentially invisible in the\noptical due to the Ly\u03b1 break.\nOur initial goal is to compare the submm properties of GRB hosts\nwith model predictions and hence provide a consistency check on\nboth techniques for tracing star formation. Ultimately we would\nlike to understand the quantitative relation between GRB rate and\nstar formation rate, so that larger samples of GRBs may be used to\ngive a good description of the global star formation history of the\nUniverse.\n2 P R E V I O U S S U B M I L L I M E T R E S T U D I E S\nO F G R B H O S T S\nThe first submm limits and detections of GRB host galaxies came\nfrom observations aimed at detecting GRB afterglows. Only in a\ncouple of cases were such fading afterglows detected, but GRB\n010222 was found to be a steady source, suggesting the flux was\ndominated by emission from a bright host galaxy (Frail et al. 2002).\nUseful upper limits were also obtained for a number of other hosts\n(Galama et al. 1999; Kulkarni et al. 1999b; Smith et al. 1999, 2001).\nIt is possible to average a number of non-detections providing\nsystematic uncertainties are small, to find the average flux density\nfor a whole sample. Unfortunately in the case of the afterglow obser-\nvations, since there may well be some small afterglow contribution\nto each observation, even if it is not detected significantly in indi-\nvidual cases, this averaging procedure is best avoided. For the data\ndiscussed here the observations were generally made long after the\nafterglow should have faded.\nAn obvious concern, already raised in Section 1.3, is that those\nGRBs with optically detected afterglows may be biased against re-\nsiding in dusty hosts, the very galaxies which would on average\nbe submm-bright. In an effort to assess whether such a bias exists,\nBarnard et al. (2003, hereafter paper 1) observed a small sample\nof \u2018dark\u2019 GRBs with deep limits on any optical afterglow but with\ngood radio and\/or X-ray positions. The expectation at the outset was\nthat compared to the hosts of optically bright GRBs, these would be\nmore likely to be dusty, massive star-forming galaxies. In fact, this\nsample of four produced only one individually significant detection,\nand no overall excess of 850-\u00b5m emission over that predicted by\nRamirez-Ruiz et al. (2002) for all hosts.\nThese results appear to argue against dark bursts being preferen-\ntially found in dusty hosts. However, this is only a small sample, and\nin paper 1 we also remarked that there was some evidence from the\nrapid decay of the radio afterglows that two of the bursts in submm-\nfaint hosts could have been dark due to intrinsic optical faintness,\nrather than extinction. In fact, it is becoming clearer that there is\na broad range in brightness of optical afterglows and a number of\ndetected bursts would have been missed in most afterglow searches.\nFor example, GRB 980613, GRB 000630 and GRB 021211 (Fynbo\net al. 2001; Hjorth et al. 2002; Fox et al. 2003) were all around R \u223c\n23 at 1 d, and, although the sample of bursts studied in paper 1 were\nfainter than all these, the upper limits do not require them to have\nbeen much fainter. Similarly, GRB 020124 had a relatively typical\nintrinsic magnitude, but appeared faint because of its redshift of\nz = 3.2 (Hjorth et al. 2003b). In any event, as we see below, even\nthe modest rate of submm detections for dark-burst hosts found in\npaper 1 appears to be somewhat greater than the rate which is now\nfound for hosts of optically detected bursts.\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 1073\u20131080\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1076 N.

Below we present our results for\nanother sample of hosts (which partially overlaps with Be03), and\ncombine and analyse all the extant data.\n3 N E W DATA\nWe have obtained further submm photometry of the host galax-\nies of optically identified GRBs, using the Submillimetre Common\nUser Bollometer Array (SCUBA) instrument on the James Clerk\nMaxwell Telescope (JCMT). The targets were chosen to be well\nplaced for observation from Mauna Kea, and have subarcsec posi-\ntions from their optical afterglows. All observations were made at\nleast 12 weeks after the burst (and usually much longer), and are\ntherefore very unlikely to be contaminated with afterglow emission.\nObservations and reduction were performed as described in pa-\nper 1. The log and results are detailed in Table 1; note that some were\nreported by Barnard (2002).

More recently\nthe original identification has been confirmed (Watson et al. 2002), so we\nreport this submm measurement here.\npaper 1, seven are in common with Be03. This is useful to improve\nthe measurement uncertainties, and also to check for statistical con-\nsistency, since the methods of reduction differ somewhat. Overall,\nwe are reassured to find no significant systematic difference between\nthe two data sets. The galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is, however, a little\nlarger than expected from the quoted errors. Specifically, four of the\nseven disagree by more than 1\u03c3 , which could happen by chance,\nbut it leads us to suspect that the uncertainties found by one or both\ngroups are marginally underestimated.\nIn Table 2, we combine these results with the data presented in\npaper 1 and Be03. Where galaxies have been observed twice, we\naverage using weights derived from the quoted errors. In one case,\nGRB 000911, Smith et al. (2001) find a flux which is inconsistent\nwith Be03, and we therefore average those results together. In an-\nother case, GRB 990123, the limits from Galama et al. (1999) and\nKulkarni et al. (1999b) on afterglow emission are a considerably\nstronger constraint on any host contribution than our photometry,\nso again we adopt an average value. Although strictly this could\nintroduce afterglow contamination it must be very small.\n4 D I S C U S S I O N\nThe combined sample contains 21 host galaxies which have\n850-\u00b5m measures with better than 1.4-mJy uncertainties; indeed\nmost of these have errors \u0002 1 mJy. Our discussion refers mainly to\nthis well-observed sample.\nOnly three galaxies have significant positive detections, namely\nthe hosts of GRB 010222, GRB 000418 and GRB 000210, which are\nall found at >3.5\u03c3 , and so can be regarded as confident detections.\nA few others have \u223c2\u03c3 detections, but we should be more wary\nof these, particularly since there are also a couple of cases of \u223c2\u03c3\nnegative fluxes. This latter fact could be taken as a further hint of a\nsmall underestimate in the errors, but equally it could be a chance\noccurrence given the sample size and the fact that the quoted errors\ndo not account for crowding noise.\nFor reasonable dust temperatures of order 40 K, corresponding\nto rest-frame far-IR SEDs peaking at about 90\u00b5m, the luminosities\nof these galaxies would be about 6 \u00d7 1012 L\u0005. If all this energy\nwas provided by star formation, then a star formation rate upward\nof 1000 M\u0005 yr\u22121 would be required (e.g. Blain et al. 2003).\nTwo hosts previously identified as possibly highly star forming\nare GRB 980703 and GRB 000911, on the basis of radio flux (Berger\net al. 2001b) and submm (Be03) respectively. Our compilation sug-\ngests that in both instances these initial results were overestimates \u2013\nin the former case, plausibly due to the scatter in the FIR-radio\ncorrelation. In the case of GRB 000911, the conclusion proceeds\nfrom the low flux seen in the afterglow observations of Smith et al.\n(2001). As a general point, we note that when working at the limit of\ndetection, since there are many more low-luminosity galaxies than\nhigh-luminosity, the fluxes of the brightest galaxies in any sample\nare more likely to be overestimates than underestimates. This effect\nis akin to Eddington\u2013Malmquist bias, and tells us that we should\nnot be surprised if the fluxes of the brighter galaxies are frequently\nfound to be lower on remeasurement.\n4.1 Properties of the sample\nFor these 21 hosts, the error-weighted mean 850-\u00b5m flux density\nis 0.93 \u00b1 0.18 mJy. This can be used to test the null hypothesis of\nzero flux for the sample, and, as expected, rejects it with confidence.\nHowever, this number is not a fair estimate of the true mean of the\nsample since we have not accounted for the intrinsic dispersion in\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 1073\u20131080\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nSubmillimetre properties of GRB host galaxies 1077\nTable 2.

(1999b) with SCUBA (850 \u00b5m) on several occasions between 1 and 15 days after the\nburst. Although there is the possibility of a small amount of afterglow contamination, the flux density we list here is an weighted average of all the Galama\net al. and Kulkarni et al. measures, together with our rather shallow result. For the purpose of the analysis presented here, the fact that a host flux density of\n>2 mJy is ruled out is the important point. \u2020 The GRB 000911 host was observed by Be03 at 2.31 \u00b1 0.91 mJy and also by Smith et al. (2001) who found 0.03 \u00b1\n0.86 mJy about a week after the burst. Since this is the one case of a significant discrepancy between the Smith et al. result and a subsequent measurement, we\nhave chosen to average the two results here.\nGRB host-galaxy luminosities (about which we do not have prior\nknowledge), and also because the brighter galaxies were in some\ncases (notably GRB 010222) observed for longer and hence have\nsmaller error bars for that reason. The unweighted mean is 0.58 \u00b1\n0.36 mJy, and is a fairer estimate of the true mean. This is higher\nthan the average 850-\u00b5m flux density found for samples of Lyman-\nbreak galaxies, which range between 0 and \u223c0.4 mJy, depending\non the exact sample selection (Chapman et al. 2000; Peacock et al.\n2000; Webb et al. 2003).\nWhat distribution do we expect to see? As a starting point,\nwe assume that both submm luminosity and GRB rate are per-\nfectly correlated with star formation rate. In that case, if submm\nflux and GRB detection completeness were also perfectly red-\nshift independent, then the predicted distribution would simply\nbe the submm-luminosity-weighted luminosity function of all\ngalaxies.\nRamirez-Ruiz et al. (2002) use the models of Blain et al. (1999a,b)\nfor the evolution of the submm galaxy population to predict the\n850-\u00b5m flux density distribution of GRB hosts. Uncertainties in\nthe model are almost entirely due to the uncertain link between the\nGRB rate and high-mass star formation heating dust. Subject to the,\nprobably low, rate of contamination in the submm galaxy population\nfrom AGN heating, and to possible evolution of the initial mass\nfunction (IMF), the flux density distribution of submm galaxies is\nreasonably well constrained throughout the interval 1\u201315 mJy (Blain\net al. 2002; Borys et al. 2003). Although it predates the substantially\ncomplete observed redshift distribution of submm galaxies from\nChapman et al. (2003a), the assumed model is in good agreement\nwith these results. It is possible that the galaxies are systematically\ncooler and less luminous (e.g. Efstathiou & Rowan-Robinson 2003);\nhowever, if that is the case, then the redshift distribution is only\nconsistent with significant evolution of the form of the far-infrared\u2013\nradio correlation with redshift.\nFig. 1 shows the predictions of this model as filled points. To\nprovide a fair comparison, the model output was convolved with\nthe distribution of observational errors, and includes a correction to\nallow for the possibility of the chance appearance of an unrelated\nsubmm source in the SCUBA beam. The latter correction amounts\nto roughly 0.7 of an object contaminating the 2\u20134 mJy bin and is\nbased on the source counts summarized in Blain et al. (2002). We\nhave chosen to put error bars on the model, reflecting the counting\nstatistics of the proportion expected in each bin. The histogram\nrepresents the submm observations.\nIt is apparent that there is a dearth of hosts with >4-mJy, 850-\u00b5m\nflux densities, which is becoming statistically significant (formally,\nat the 1.6\u03c3 level). In fact, the significance is greater if we consider the\nremaining five galaxies with larger error bars, namely GRB 970828,\nGRB 990308, GRB 001025A, GRB 020124 and GRB 020813 (and\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 1073\u20131080\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \n1078 N. R. Tanvir et al.\nFigure 1. Comparison between observations (histogram) for the 21 hosts\nwith <1.4-mJy flux uncertainties, and predictions (shown as filled points).\nThe results are binned into just three (different sized) bins, essentially rep-\nresenting no confident detection, confident but faint detection, and \u2018bright\u2019\ndetection respectively. The predictions are based on those from Ramirez-\nRuiz et al. (2002) but also account for the observational error distribution\nand the crowding noise (i.e. essentially the rate of false positives). Errors\nbars are placed on the predictions simply reflecting the counting statistics\nrather than any uncertainty in the model parameters. In that sense, they are\na lower limit to the true errors.\nindeed one might also include GRB 980519 from Smith et al. 1999),\nsince at 1\u03c3 these are all inconsistent with being >4-mJy sources as\nwell.\nFurthermore, we note that if the estimated flux uncertainties are\nsomewhat optimistic (as suggested in Section 3), it tends to make\nthe discrepancy between theory and observations rather worse. This\nseems counterintuitive, but is due to the fact that larger observational\nerrors should result in more low-luminosity systems appearing in\nthe brighter bins by chance.\nAt this stage there are many possible explanations for the discrep-\nancy (beyond the relatively small sample size). First and foremost,\nwe must still worry that amongst the GRBs with \u2018very dark\u2019 after-\nglows, for which good radio or X-ray positions are not available,\nlurk a small number of highly submm-luminous hosts. Another po-\ntential selection effect is that GRBs are being preferentially picked\nup at lower redshifts, both in terms of initial detection, but more\nsignificantly the detection of the afterglows, as discussed in Sec-\ntion 1.3. This would be a less direct selection against the higher\nredshift, dusty systems, although we note that of the seven systems\nwith z > 1.5, none have significant 850-\u00b5m fluxes.\nOther possible physical explanations are as follows.\n(i) GRBs are preferentially found in low-metallicity \u2013 smaller and\nless dusty \u2013 systems. This has been predicted as a consequence of\nthe single-star collapsar model (Heger et al. 2003), and is consistent\nwith the apparent enhanced brightness of GRBs in the outer parts of\ntheir parent galaxies (Ramirez-Ruiz, Lazzati & Blain 2002), and the\nrelatively low metallicity inferred for many GRB hosts (e.g. Fynbo\net al. 2003). The latter study notes that a large proportion of GRB\nhosts are Ly\u03b1 emitters (five out of five so far studied), which is\nsignificantly greater than the proportion of Lyman-break galaxies,\nalthough perhaps surprisingly, many of the SCUBA galaxies for\nwhich Chapman et al. have recently acquired redshifts are also strong\nLy\u03b1 emitters.\n(ii) The higher-luminosity submm galaxies are more contami-\nnated by AGN, or the submm luminosity function more contam-\ninated by cooler, less luminous galaxies, than has been generally\nthought.\n(iii) While both GRBs and submm flux trace star formation rate,\nthe two are not perfectly correlated due to different phase lags with\nrespect to the true star formation rate. For instance, the simulation of\nBekki & Shioya (2001) of a merger-induced starburst shows signifi-\ncant fluctuations in the star formation rate on time-scales much less\nthan 100 Myr (their fig. 6). Given that both GRB rate and submm\nflux will not follow rapid fluctuations instantaneously, some decor-\nrelation may occur.\n(iv) Variations in the stellar IMF are having a different effect on\nGRB rate compared to submm flux; or (e) that GRBs for some reason\nare occurring preferentially in galaxies with high dust temperatures,\nso more of the bolometric luminosity appears at shorter wavelengths\nand is being missed at 850 \u00b5m.\n4.2 Properties of the submm-bright GRB hosts\nIf submm flux traces star formation, and the selection of GRB hosts\nis unbiased, then the submm-bright GRB hosts as a whole should\nbe similar to the general population of submm-bright galaxies. Of\ncourse, now we are dealing with a very small sample, but it is in-\nteresting to examine the properties of the three hosts with 850-\u00b5m\nflux densities above 2 mJy.\nGorosabel et al. (2003a) have constructed a UV to IR SED for the\nhost to GRB 000210, which is well fitted by a starburst SED with a\nrelatively modest star formation rate of 2 M\u0005 yr\u22121 and negligible\nextinction. The redshift is z = 0.84 and the luminosity L \u2248 0.5L \u0002.\nThe UV to IR SED of the GRB 000418 host (Gorosabel et al.\n2003b) is also well fitted by a starburst template, in this case with a\nmoderate amount of extinction AV \u223c 0.4, and a star formation rate\nup to 60 M\u0005 yr\u22121. A similar result is obtained in the spectroscopic\nstudy of Bloom et al. (2003), who also find no evidence of any AGN\ncontamination. This star formation rate is still an order of magnitude\nless than that derived from the submm, but that is not unreasonable\nfor heavily obscured galaxies. The redshift is z = 1.12 and the\nluminosity is L \u2248 L \u0002. It is compact with effective radius r E \u2248\n1 kpc, and the afterglow was located close to the optical centroid\n(Fruchter & Metzger 2001; Bloom et al. 2003). The afterglow itself\nhas produced extinction estimates ranging from AV \u223c 0.4 (Berger\net al. 2001a) to AV \u223c 1 (Klose et al. 2000).\nThe host of GRB 010222 is fainter still in the optical at R \u2248 25.3\n(Fruchter et al. 2001a), but it is also moderately blue, with I\u2212K \u2248\n2.1 and an intrinsic luminosity L \u223c 0.1L \u0002 (Frail et al. 2002). The\nredshift is z = 1.477 and again HST images reveal the afterglow to\nhave been located on top of the peak of the optical emission.\nIn all these cases if the submm is really indicating copious\namounts of hidden star formation activity, it would appear that the\noptically visible part of the host is dominated by one or more rel-\natively unextinguished regions. This is plausible \u2013 it could be con-\ncentrated in a shell or plume of material, or possibly a number\nof \u2018windows\u2019 through an obscuring shroud (e.g. Bekki, Shioya &\nTanaka 1999). However, if this is the case, it also seems that the\noptically bright regions must be spatially proximate to the bright\nfar-IR emission if we are to understand why the afterglows (as with\nmost detected GRBs) tend to be found close to the optical centroids\n(or hotspots) of the hosts.\nSo, how do the properties of these galaxies compare with the\nthe optical\/IR counterparts of the submm-bright galaxies selected\nin blank-field SCUBA surveys? In fact the bright SCUBA galax-\nies display quite a wide variety of characteristics. They have been\nsplit into three classes (Smail et al. 2002): class 0 are relatively\nbright in optical as well as submm \u2013 much of the star formation\nis unextinguished; class 1 are extremely red objects (EROs) with\nI \u2212 K typically greater than 5; finally class 2 are extremely faint\nin optical and IR. This classification system was conceived based\nC\u00a9 2004 RAS, MNRAS 352, 1073\u20131080\n at :: on N\novem\nber 24, 2015\nhttp:\/\/m\nnras.oxfordjournals.org\/\nD\now\nnloaded from\n \nSubmillimetre properties of GRB host galaxies 1079\non galaxies which are generally brighter than 5 mJy at 850 \u00b5m. Al-\nthough no GRB host to-date is that bright, it appears that the submm-\nbrightest of the GRB hosts do not fit neatly into this scheme, being\nintermediate in optical\/IR luminosity between classes 0 and 2, but\nnot very red EROs like class 1. Interestingly, the best candidate for\nan extremely red GRB host galaxy, that of GRB 980326 which has\nR\u2212K \u0001 6 (although the K detection at K = 22.9 is <3\u03c3 ; Chary,\nBecklin & Armus 2002), has a low submm luminosity. This com-\npares to an average 850-\u00b5m flux density of \u2248 1.6 mJy recently\nfound by Wehner, Barger & Kneib (2002) for a K-selected sample\nof EROs.\nFurthermore, as discussed in Section 1.2, the redshift distribution\nof bright SCUBA sources shows a peak in the redshift range 2\u20133,\nwhereas these three submm-bright GRB hosts are nearer z \u223c 1.\nWe conclude that the properties of the few submm-bright GRB\nhosts found to-date are not very representative of the submm-bright\ngalaxies as a whole: they do not fit easily within any of the three\nclasses. Be03 reached the same conclusion based on a colour\u2013\nredshift plot, in which the submm-bright GRB hosts lie bluer and\nat lower redshift than the submm-selected galaxies as a whole. This\ncould be because the GRB hosts are somewhat fainter at 850 \u00b5m,\nsince nearly all well-studied submm samples are\u00015 mJy (although\nFrayer et al. 2003 report a detailed study of a single gravitationally\nlensed source at z = 2.51, which has a low submm flux density\nof S850 < 2 mJy after correction for lensing). As discussed above,\nwe also expect GRB selection to provide some bias toward pick-\ning up lower-redshift galaxies, and against very dusty galaxies. The\nalternative, of course, is that either the submm selection has some\nproblems, such as a surprising rate of AGN contamination, or sur-\nprising dust properties, or GRB progenitors are more likely to arise\nin less dusty systems.\n5 C O N C L U S I O N S\nWe have shown that while a small number of GRB hosts are bright\nsubmm galaxies, indicating high star formation rates, the proportion,\nparticularly at flux densities >4 mJy, is fewer than predicted if both\nGRBs and submm flux trace star formation in an unbiased way. Fur-\nthermore, and similarly puzzling, the three submm-brightest GRB\nhosts are not very typical in terms of their optical properties and red-\nshift distribution of the galaxies selected in blind submm surveys.\nOf course, the current sample size is still rather small, and very\nlikely suffers some selection biases. In particular, GRBs in very\ndusty hosts and\/or at higher redshifts are more likely to be miss-\ning from the observed afterglow samples. A small number of these\namongst the \u2018dark\u2019 bursts (those without optical counterparts to\ndeep limits) could remove the discrepancy \u2013 although the afterglows\nknown to be genuinely very faint is only a small fraction of those for\nwhich optical emission has not been detected. Furthermore, a fair\nproportion of the darker bursts seem to be dark for reasons other than\ntheir residing in high-redshift, dusty ULIRGs, so it is not obvious\nthat this selection effect provides the full explanation.\nFuture studies may largely overcome these selection problems\nby much earlier and more uniform afterglow searches with SWIFT\nand various robotic telescopes. The positions from the SWIFT\/XRT\nmay be good enough to identify ULIRG hosts, even when no optical\nafterglow is detected. Spitzer will also be a powerful tool, particu-\nlarly for the lower-redshift hosts z \u0002 1, where the large majority of\nthe bolometric luminosity appears in the far-IR.\nIf it turns out that the discrepancy with the model predictions\npersists when more complete samples are studied, it will certainly\nbe telling us something interesting about the astrophysics of GRBs\nand\/or the relationship between FIR emission and star formation.\nOn the other hand, if the disagreement goes away, the use of GRBs\nas practical star formation indicators will be strongly bolstered.\nAC K N OW L E D G M E N T S\nWe thank the referee, Steve Serjeant, for insightful comments,\nJochen Greiner for keeping his invaluable web site up to date\n(http:\/\/www.mpe.mpg.de\/\u223cjcg\/grbgen.html) and Paul Vreeswijk,\nJens Hjorth, Javier Gorosabel and Johan Fynbo for useful dis-\ncussions.
