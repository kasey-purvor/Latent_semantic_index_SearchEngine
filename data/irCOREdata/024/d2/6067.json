It includes selected papers from the CAA\nConference, along with other CAA papers from across further and higher education.\nThe variety of different papers, and the issues they explore, illustrates that CAA is\nnow an active and established research area, which is testing both the technical and\npedagogical challenges associated with developing and delivering assessment online.\nThis special issue is dedicated to a colleague and good friend, Dr Joanna Bull, who\nsadly passed away in June this year. Her death has come as a great shock to us all. Jo\nwas a leading light in the field of CAA, being well known and respected by the\ncommunity. She directed the highly successful TLTP-funded National CAA Centre,\nand through this co-authored the Blueprint for CAA which is still widely cited and\nused. Jo produced a wealth of publications, material, and most recently had set up an\nindependent consultancy through her own business \u2018Eduology\u2019. She will be very, very\nsadly missed, but not forgotten.\nThe issue consists of six papers: five focus specifically on CAA, and one more\nbroadly on the pedagogies of e-learning.\nThe first article by Sclater, describes an ambitious cross-sector initiative in\nScotland which is developing a large bank of assessment items for units across the\nScottish further education sector. The paper highlights the issues involved with the\ninitiative such as decisions about appropriate item types and subject areas, the need\nfor training and guidelines for authors, the nature of the peer-review and quality\nassurance processes and associated metadata and interoperability issues.\nThe second article by Sim et al. provides a review of the literature on CAA and a\ncritique of associated issues, such as interoperability, security, test construction and\ntesting higher cognitive skills.\nThe third article by McAlpine reports on the development of an evaluation\nframework to facilitate the translation of paper-based to computer-based assessments\nand in particular the framework aims to assess and enhance the practicability of large-\nscale CAA migration for existing items and assessments.\nThe forth article by Clarke et al. provides an insightful case study to evaluate the\nuse of online MCQs in humanities as a means of reinforcing and extending student\nlearning at Oxford University. In particular the research focused on a series of themes,\n204 Editorial\nreinforcement of learning, cementing students\u2019 understanding, deepening students\u2019\nknowledge and framing educational expectations. However they conclude that \u2018there\nis still much work to do if there is to be a shift in our assessment paradigms \u2026 and\nthe benefits of formative assessment can be realized and integrated into the rigid study\nstructures posed by many higher education systems\u2019.\nThe fifth article by Davies provides a different kind of case study that evaluated the\nvalidity of assessing students via a computerized peer-marking process. The study\nconcluded that the higher performing students achieve a greater improvement in their\noverall marks.\nThe sixth article by Mehanna on the pedagogies of e-learning explores the different\npedagogic techniques employed to establish effective e-learning practice. She carried\nout a detailed study of a computer mediated conference over a year, and derived nine\nclusters of pedagogies consisting of 29 pedagogic behaviours, and concludes that\nblending different learning theories and pedagogies is not only possible but beneficial.\nWe continue our Discussion series and in this issue Boyle and Cook provide an\ninsightful commentary on Conole and Dykes\u2019 affordances of ICT paper published in\nthe last issue, along with a response from the authors. The notion of affordances in\nrelation to e-learning is a hotly contested one and we hope that these responses\nprovide a useful starting point for a more detailed discussion on this topic.\nGr\u00e1inne Conole, Editor\nMyles Danson, Director of the International CAA Conference and\nCAA Manager at Loughborough University\n"}
