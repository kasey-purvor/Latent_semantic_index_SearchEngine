However, \napplication of recently developed micro-scale and 2-D measurement techniques have \ndemonstrated more complicated solute structures in some sediments, including discrete \nlocalized sites of depleted oxygen, and elevated trace metals and sulphide, referred to as \nmicroniches. A model of transport and reaction in sediments, that can simulate the dynamic \ndevelopment of concentration gradients occurring in 3-D, was developed. Its graphical user \ninterface (GUI) allows easy input of user-specified reactions and provides flexible schemes \nthat prioritise their execution. The 3-D capability was demonstrated by quantitative modelling \nof hypothetical solute behaviour at organic matter microniches covering a range of sizes. \nSignificant effects of microniches on the profiles of oxygen and nitrate are demonstrated. \nSulphide is shown to be readily generated in microniches within one centimetre of the \nsediment surface, provided the diameter of the reactive organic material is greater than one \nmillimetre. These modelling results illustrate the geochemical complexities that arise when \nprocesses occur in 3-D and demonstrate the need for such a model. Future use of high-\nresolution measurement techniques should include the collection of data for relevant major \ncomponents, such as reactive iron and manganese oxides, to allow full, multi-component \nmodelling of microniche processes.   \nKeywords: early diagenesis, diffusion, high resolution, organic matter, redox reactions, \nsulfide, trace metals     \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 3\nIntroduction \nUnderstanding of the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, manganese, iron and sulphur in sediments is \nlargely based on measurement of solution and solid phase components in vertically arranged \nslices of cores. The dynamic interactions of the various components have been successfully \nmodelled by coupling the reactions to one-dimensional (1-D) diffusion, with the implicit \nassumption of horizontal uniformity.[1-3] Although transport and reaction in relation to \nidealized burrows and mounds has been treated quantitatively (Aller[4] and references therein), \nprocesses of bioturbation and bio-irrigation are commonly modelled by considering their \naverage effects on transport.[5]  \nThe true heterogeneous nature of the solid phase of sediments, especially at the sub-mm scale, \nis well recognized, but these variations are implicitly assumed to be averaged within the \ntypical volume (20-100 ml) of a sediment slice.[6] Various techniques have emerged that can \nmeasure concentrations of solutes directly, on a small scale, without the volumetric averaging \ninherent in core slices. They are showing that solute concentrations may vary markedly on a \nsmall (sub-mm) scale. Data from planar optodes has demonstrated the temporary development \nof small spheres (1-2 mm diameter) of anoxia within sediment[7] and at the sediment surface, \n[8] as particles of highly reactive organic matter consume all available oxygen. Sharp dips in \noxygen concentration in otherwise smooth vertical profiles obtained using micro-electrodes, \nmay be similarly explained.[6]  \nTwo-dimensional maps of concentrations of metals and sulphide, obtained using DGT \n(diffusive gradients in thin-films),[9-13] have demonstrated that the maxima and minima can \noccur at discrete sites. These observations are consistent with the idea of microniches, where \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 4\ndiscrete patches of reactive material bring about pronounced local changes in sediment \nchemistry.  \nWe define the term microniche as a small-scale location within the 3-D sediment matrix \nwhere the geochemical behaviour differs significantly from the average for that depth. An \nexample might be a particle of organic matter or other component (e.g. iron oxide) that has \nbiogeochemical reaction rates which are higher (or lower) than the surrounding \nenvironment.[6]  \nModelling of microniches \nJ\u00f8rgensen[14] modelled the depletion of oxygen within such niches and concluded that \nsulphate reduction may occur within pellets as small as 100 \u00b5m in diameter. Brandes and \nDevol[15] modelled numerically the 2-D distribution of oxygen and nitrate by considering their \nreactions at points of reactive organic material distributed stochastically in a planar grid of \n100 \u00b5m resolution. The averaged vertical profiles were able to explain the similar penetration \nof O2 and NO3- observed in pore waters obtained by whole core squeezing at 1mm resolution. \nThis stochastic approach was extended to 3-D by Harper et al.[16] They showed that the \nproduction of dissolved metal ions within local sources (>100 \u00b5m diameter) set in sediment \nacting as a uniform sink for metals, resulted in much more sharply defined solute maxima \n(typically 0.5 mm wide) than would be possible with diffusion restricted to 1-D. Reactive \ntransport models for sediments, which include advective contaminant exchange, have been \ndeveloped.[17-20] Such models have included 3-D simulations of the effects of various \nsediment-water interface geometries,[21, 22] and these models have been further developed to \ninclude the effects of bioirrigation.[23] A 3-D model by Meile et al.[24] was devised to include \norganic matter diagenesis reactions and was applied to assessing the effect of burrow \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 5\nirrigation on solute distributions. Using this model the significance of burrowing organisms in \nlocally enhancing penetration of both oxygen and nitrate was demonstrated.  \nMicroniche sources and life-span \nAs the term microniche can apply to any discrete site of reactive organic matter (OM), it can \nencompass material from a range of different sources. Microniches can be attributed to \ndecaying organisms (observed using a pH optode[25]), algal aggregates (added to sediment to \nstudy sulphidic microniches[12]) and faecal pellets (photographed after resin embedding and \nthin sectioning of an intact core [26]). Root systems can also generate microniches.[27] Such \nniches will have a range of different properties. For example: algal aggregates will tend to \nhave a high porosity and a low concentration of authigenic oxides; faecal pellets may possess \na peritrophic membrane, be more compact than the ambient sediment (lower porosity) and in \nsome cases have been shown to contain a greater proportion of fine mineral grains than the \nambient sediment,[26] potentially affecting tortuosity.  \nThe life-span of niches will depend upon organic matter degradation reaction rates and the \nsupply of oxidants, with niche size affecting oxidant supply to the centre of the niche. The \nduration of anoxia within a microniche occupying the oxic zone may be unlikely to exceed \n2.5 days, as Alldredge and Cohen[28] found little or no O2 depletion in faecal pellets of this \nage or older. Zhu et al[25] measured pH at a decaying organism and observed that the \ngeneration of protons from the niche was not measurable after approximately 80 hours. These \nstudies indicate that microniches tend to have life-spans of days rather than weeks or months.  \nAims and approach \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 6\nHere we present a dynamic diagenetic model set within a 3-D framework, for the \ninvestigation of geochemical processes at microniches. The model s novelty lies in \nconsidering in three dimensions both diffusion and organic matter diagenesis (and associated \nsecondary reactions) in small-scale volumes of sediment. It provides for the generation of \nvertical concentration gradients according to recent 1-D models, while allowing the definition \nof localized spherical zones of various diameters that may differ in the concentrations, \ntransport or reactivity of components (microniches).  \nEngineering software packages such as COMSOL are now being used to model diagenetic \nprocesses (e.g. Cardenas and Wilson[21]). While we could have alternatively built and \npresented specific model simulations using such a package, we chose to develop a self \ncontained, flexible model, capable of representing a wide range of microniche environments, \nthat will be made freely available. It incorporates a graphical user interface (figure included as \nAccessory Materials), which allows geochemists with no prior modelling expertise to set up \nand run quite complex problems within a few hours. It can be used to model observed field \ndata or to test hypotheses. In contrast to traditional 1-D models, e.g. Berg et al[3], the model is \nnot intended to be used to investigate sediment at the bulk scale, where transport by biota \nneeds to be considered. Therefore, features such as tubes, and the transport processes \nassociated with them (e.g. irrigation or advection) are not incorporated. In practise, the small, \nmm-scale, features being modelled may occur between burrows. Consequently, on the \ntimescales of a few days that characterize the lifetime of microniches, they and the burrows \ncan be regarded as separate entities. Consistent with this view, bioturbation may be \nresponsible for relocating a microniche, while not affecting the physical properties of its \nlocalized domain. As sedimentation will not be significant over the time-scales of days, it is \nnot considered. Validation was achieved by comparison of model outputs with known \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 7\nanalytical solutions. Examples of distributions of solutes in the vicinity of microniches of a \nrange of sizes (one to five mm) are shown. We show the effect of microniches on solute \nconcentrations within and around niches that are positioned close to sediment water interface \nwithin ambient oxic and suboxic sediment.   \nModel Formulation \nModelling in 3-D presents conceptual and computational challenges. The models must be \ngeochemically sound with respect to transport and reactions, while allowing specific \nexamples of heterogeneity (microniches). The model we have developed uses existing \nunderstanding of reaction and transport gained from measurements and modelling in 1-D. A \nsimilar system that allows input and simulation of vertical profiles of components is \nconstructed within a 3-D framework. Spherical zones that represent microniches, may be \ncreated at any location within the 3-D grid (based on the principle that microniches in nature \nare likely to be introduced at various depths by the actions of biota). As the lifetime of \nmicroniches is generally relatively short (days) we have focused on short spatial scales (sub-\nmm to cm) and times, and have disregarded longer-term processes such as sediment \nrecruitment and accumulation. The ultimate aim was to model the heterogeneous distribution \nof a range of components in sediments in response to the existence of microniches. To \nachieve this goal it was necessary to consider the oxidation of organic matter (OM) and all \nassociated redox processes normally considered in diagenetic models. To allow ease of use, \nan executable form of the model has been developed with a graphical user interface (GUI). \nFlexibility was preserved by allowing the user to define all reactions and the initial spatial set \nup. The result is a versatile model for considering solute transport and reaction dynamics in \nsediments (known as 3D-TREAD), which can be used for a wide range of applications.   \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 8\nThe model was divided into three modules: a GUI to allow user-friendly control of the \nsimulation setup, a Calculation Unit where all simulations are solved, and a Reporting and \nGraphics module that was implemented in Matlab. It provides plots and output text files of \nconcentration profiles of species for specified coordinates (details of model output and data \nextraction are provided in the Accessory Materials). Module one (GUI) allows the user to \ncontrol the entire simulation process from designing the problem to solving and viewing the \nresults.  \nThe calculations unit contains all the solving routines, its input being the setup files prepared \nby the GUI unit. The transport and reaction formulation is implemented using the long-\nestablished Finite Element Method (FEM).[29] For this it uses OFELI (Object Finite Element \nLibrary)[30] to create the FEM mesh, interpret the user requirements and solve the model \nequations. The model space is subdivided into a large number of small parts to discretise the \ncontinuous volume. Each of these parts is considered to be homogeneous. These parts are \ncalled elements and together they form a mesh. Every element is identified by its nodes \npoints in space stored in the form of a vector (or array) of numbers. For microniches, elements \nare identified as being inside or outside the niche. Figure 1 illustrates the equivalent 2-D \nsituation. In 3-D, the circle becomes a sphere and the triangles become tetrahedrons. By \nincreasing the mesh size, elements become smaller, leading to better spherical definition. \nSpatial resolution is set by a value that controls the number of nodes per volume unit: the \ncalculation precision increases as this value decreases. As an approximation this value can be \nassumed to be the minimum linear resolution resolved by the mesh. For example if the \nresolution is set at 0.05 (and the domain dimensions are in cm), the linear resolution will be at \nleast as good as 500 \u00b5m (explained more fully in the Accessory Materials). Further \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 9\ndescriptions of mesh, model implementation and of more advanced features for the \nspecification of microniches are provided as Accessory Materials.  \nModel inputs and calculations \nThe simulated system can be defined using the GUI, which allows the following input of data. \n(a) Initial vertical concentration profiles and concentrations within microniches for all \nchemical components. (b) Diffusion coefficients in water for each component separately. (c) \nPorosity allows calculation of effective diffusion coefficients at each depth and for each \nmicroniche. (d) Selection of tortuosity equation selects equation and variable values to be \napplied to the diffusion coefficient calculation. (e) Nature of the boundary for solute \ncomponents  boundaries can be specified at the top and\/or bottom of the domain. (f) Domain \ninput of domain dimensions, mesh resolution, model simulation run-time and calculation \ntime-step. (g) Reaction stoichiometry, rates, and priorities.  \nWith these data all the possible components that are in the simulated system are specified. \nEach individual pool of OM is considered as a separate component, which effectively \nprovides a very flexible multi-G model.[31-33] The multi-G approach is particularly suitable for \nthis model, which considers sufficiently short periods of diagenesis that accumulation and \nburial processes can be disregarded. For other models where longer-term processes are \nconsidered, the power model ( continuous-G ) of Middelburg[34] may be equally valid. \nUltimately, knowledge of the behaviour and distributions of microbial communities and the \ndegradation of known organic molecules and functional groups may lead to a more advanced \nunderstanding of OM degradation. However, given the current status of our understanding the \nmore holistic approach of multi-G is the best available option.  \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 10\nAll the reactive species participate in reactions that each have a set of user-specified values. \n(a) Priority group and order within this group (i.e. for organic matter pools and the order of \noxidant utilisation) (b) Reference component and concentration threshold (for specification of \noxidants in OM reactions).

These porosity adjustments are \nspecified according to Berg et al.[3] \n2\n1 ( )\n( )\n1 ( )\n( )1\n( )1\n( )\nreaction involving OM\nSolute Solute reaction\nSolute Solid reaction\nSolid Solid reaction\nSolid transformations\nSolute transformations\n(2) \nAs porosity can be specified as both a vertical profile and separately for microniches, \nintroduces variations in the reaction rates with depth and within microniches (Eq. 2). \nTransformation reactions are included in the model for processes involving single species; for \nexample reactive iron oxides converting into a form not reactive to OM[3] or the adsorption of \na solute onto a solid phase.  \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 11\nThere are two main types of reactions: primary and secondary. The difference between them \nlies in regulation of their execution, which follow the principles used by Hunter et al[35] and \nBerg et al.[3]   \nOrganic matter (involved only in primary reactions) can be defined as a series of separate \ncomponents, each with their individual concentration profiles and distributions of \nmicroniches. A set of electron acceptors (EA; solutes or solids) facilitates the decomposition \nof each component of OM through a set of j primary reactions. Each reaction is assigned a \npriority index. When the concentration of the highest priority EA is above a prescribed \nthreshold concentration [EA]lim, it is the only EA that reacts. The EA with the next highest \npriority can only be used when the concentration falls below [EA]lim. Each fraction of OM is \nconsumed at a single prescribed rate that is first order with respect to OM, irrespective of the \nparticipating EAs. When [EA] < [EA]lim the reaction still proceeds provided [EA] > 0, but its \nrate then becomes proportional to [EA], so that the primary redox reaction of OM degradation \nno longer follows a first order process. This complex system of priorities and rates was \nimplemented in the model by calculating the fraction, fi, of electrons consumed by the jth \nprimary reaction using the elegant formula of Hunter et al[35] (Eq. 3). \nfor j=1, 2, , P-1 \nif [EAj]>[EAj]lim  then \n1\n0\n1\nj\nj n\nn\nf f\nelse  \n1\n0 lim\n[ ]\n1 [ ]\nj\nj\nj n\nn j\nEAf f\nEA\nfor  j=P   \n1\n0\n1\nP\nj n\nn\nf f\n      \n(3) \nP is the number of primary reactions in a group.

If overlap of OM \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 12\ndecomposition by two or more EA s is undesirable, the electron acceptor limiting \nconcentrations can be set to a very low number (this avoids dividing by zero). Other reactions, \nthat do not involve OM, are considered secondary and are allowed to proceed simultaneously \nat each time step of the calculation according to their specified rate. Secondary reactions are \nconsidered to proceed with first order kinetics with respect to each component. However, the \nmodel retains the flexibility to specify overall first order (for a chosen component) or zero \norder, if required.  \nThe reactive transport equation for the ith (mobile) aqueous component is shown in Eq. 4. \n,\n( )i i i i i reac i\nC D C v C R\nt\n     \n(4) \nwhere Ci is the total aqueous concentration, Rreac,i is a source or sink rate due to chemical \nreaction, Di is the diffusivity coefficient (matrix) and vi is the pore-water velocity vector of \nthe ith component.

Where upper or lower boundary \nconcentrations are specified they are considered to be Dirichlet boundaries (i.e. fixed \nconcentrations) by the transport process solver. There are four options for specifying solute \nboundaries; only upper or lower boundary specified, both boundaries specified or no \nboundaries specified (this option assumes zero flux at the boundary so that the gradients of \nconcentration are equal to zero). Specified boundaries are defined by fixed concentrations \nentered by the user. Boundary conditions can not be individually specified for the four sides \nof the domain (zero flux applies).  \nThe top interface is commonly the surface of the diffusive boundary layer, where fixed \nconcentrations that are representative of values in the overlying water are appropriate. The \nbottom interface does not have such a simple conceptual analogue. It is necessary because all \nsolutes may not be generated by the model if a small vertical zone is being simulated to \naccommodate limited computing power. For example, if maxima in dissolved iron or \nmanganese concentrations were expected to occur in the sediment considered, but below the \ndepth included in the simulation, there would be an upward flux of solute iron and \nmanganese, which would be oxidized within the modelled zone. In this case, a lower \nboundary condition with fixed concentrations of Fe and Mn can be specified, allowing \ninclusion of the solute flux due to processes outside the modelled domain.  \nThe functionality of the OFELI software (diffusion process), has been verified independently \nby a large user base. Validation of all the reaction mechanisms was achieved by comparing \noutputs to known solutions. For example to test both the organic matter oxidation reaction \n(which include variables for porosity, time-step and [OM]) and the proper functioning of the \nlimiting concentrations, requires initial profiles for two or more oxidants, with the highest \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 14\norder oxidant being allowed to drop below the limiting concentration. Consider a case where: \n(a) oxygen is present at the interface, but is quickly depleted, (b) manganese oxides are \npresent equally throughout the domain, but below the limiting concentration, and (c) iron \noxides are present equally throughout the domain and are above the limiting concentration. If \nOM is present at equal concentrations throughout the domain and the degradation rate is equal \nfor all three oxidants, then the reduction in concentration of OM should be equal and \npredictable for all areas of the domain. By specifying a solid phase (immobile) product for \neach reactant, the consumption of reactants and generation of products can be calculated \nmanually for each reaction using equations 1 to 3 and the reaction stoichiometry. Agreement \nof these calculations with modelled values provided verification of the framework for the \nprimary metabolic pathways (see Accessory Materials for a more explicit example).  \nModelling solute dynamics at microniches of varying size \nTo demonstrate the capabilities of the model and to provide some insight into why microniche \nprocesses may be important, this section quantitatively investigates the effect of microniche \nsize on solute distributions and the nature of the sulphide release from these hypothetical \nmicroniches. Previous modelling of microniches, as detailed in the introduction, has tended to \ninvestigate a limited number of components (O2, NO3-, N2) in one or two dimensions.[14,15,38] \nInvestigations into the behaviour of marine snow microniches have been similarly limited,[28, \n39]\n although, sulphide production in these environments has been measured.[40]  \nHere we sought to extend the pioneering work of J\u00f8rgensen[14] to model, in 3-D, multiple \ncomponents at a microniche within an appropriate diagenetic framework. The modelling \nstructure is largely based on a comprehensive data set for a Danish marine sediment compiled \nby Fossing et al.[41] As data for microniches is limited, selecting input data for the model is \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 15\nnot trivial. Assumptions about the ambient conditions and reaction priorities are required. \nHere we set reaction rates, starting concentrations and boundary concentrations to those \nmodelled in 1-D by Fossing et al.[41] Within a simple 1-D description based on horizontally \naveraged sediment, overlap in redox zones is likely to be due to the heterogeneity of the \nsediment rather than specific biogeochemical controls occurring at given limiting \nconcentrations. However, within a microniche, it may be more reasonable to assume that there \nwill tend to be a dominant process at all times. This situation was recognised by setting \nlimiting concentrations for oxidants of the bulk OM outside the microniche to those values \nused by Fossing et al.[41]. The limiting concentrations for the oxidants of the OM within the \nmicroniche were set much lower (2% of the Fossing et al.[41] values). Use of lower thresholds \nrecognises that a single oxidant is likely to be largely responsible for OM degradation at \ndiscrete sites, while also accounting for both the likelihood that oxidant concentrations will \nbecome limiting before reaching zero and observations that microbial OM reducers utilising \ndifferent electron acceptors can co-exist in the same locality (e.g. sulphate reduction and \nmethanogenesis).[42] We have also assumed that resupply or removal of porewater Fe(II) and \nMn(II) from or to the solid phase is sufficient to buffer porewater concentrations for the 24 \nhrs modelled (these porewater concentrations were fixed for this modelling). OM microniches \nwere assumed to contain negligible concentrations of metal oxides. Therefore, the only OM-\noxidising components within the microniches are in solution, and oxidation will follow the \nprogression of O2, NO3-, SO42-. Microniche OM concentration was set at ~4-5 times the \nambient OM concentration, consistent with observations by Kristensen and Pilgaard.[43] Rates \nfor OM degradation were based on the multi-G based Fossing et al[41] data, with the bulk OM \ndegradation rates based on the slow reacting phase (with rate kOM-s) and the microniche rates \nbased on the fast reacting OM pool (with rate kOM-f) The ratio of the rates (kom-f : kom-s) was \n800. This rate results in the microniche OM concentration being depleted by ~12% of the \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 16\ninitial value over the period modelled; one third of the initial value will be reached after \napproximately 200 hrs. Initial profiles and tables of input parameters and reactions are \nprovided as Accessory Materials.  \nWith the input parameters described above and a domain of maximum x, y, z, dimensions of \n0.6 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 1.05 cm, microniches of varying diameters were introduced at a depth of 0.25 cm \nbelow the sediment-water interface at the x, y coordinates of the centre of the domain. Given \nthat the oxygen and nitrate penetration depths (defined here as the depth where the microniche \nlimiting concentration is reached) in the absence of microniches are 0.26 mm and 0.67 mm \nrespectively, the microniches have the potential to affect the profiles of multiple solutes. The \nlargest niche has an upper edge at the sediment-water interface.  \nThe 3-D distribution of solutes at four spherical microniches, of diameters 5, 3.75, 2.5 and 1 \nmm, was modelled. Figure 2 shows the porewater profiles for O2, NO3-, and total sulphide \n(sum of S-2, HS- and H2S, referred to from this point as S(-II)) through the centre of the \nmicroniches. The smaller niches ( 2.5 mm) have NO3- minima (barely discernible in the \nFigure) centred within the niche. The slightly higher values below the niche centre are due to \nlateral diffusion, which would not be observed using a 1-D model. A NO3- maximum is \ncreated at the sediment surface by the intermediate sized niche (2.5 mm). High sulphide \nconcentrations are observed at the largest niches, with only limited sulphate reduction in the \n2.5 mm niche and no sulphate reduction in the one millimetre niche where nitrate is not \ncompletely exhausted. Clearly the local geochemistry is very dependent on the size of any \naggregate of OM. It will also be dependent on location. At greater depths where nitrate is \nabsent, sulphide would be expected to be produced in small microniches, as observed by \nWiderlund and Davison.[12] \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 17\nThe significant localized changes in solute profiles that can be induced by the presence of \nmicroniches is further illustrated by Figure 3, which shows the profiles for all 3 solutes arising \nfrom a 3.75 mm diameter niche. The existence of sulphidic microniches in otherwise non-\nsulphidic zones of the sediment may have implications for the formation of metal sulphides. \nTrace metal sulphides are used as paleoredox proxies. Removal of metals from solution in \nsediments, where no removal is expected according to bulk data, may complicate \ninterpretation of such paleo-data.[13] Measurements of metals in porewaters at sulphidic \nmicroniches, using DGT, have shown that there may be localized supersaturation with respect \nto metal sulphides.[11]   \nTime series data can be obtained from 3-D TREAD, as shown in Figure 4, for NO3- and S(-\nII) profiles at the 2.5 mm microniche over the first 24 hrs of the model run. Sulphide rapidly \nincreases as the initial NO3- concentration within the niche is limited. As more NO3- is \nproduced within the oxic sediment layer (due to oxidation of ammonia released from the \nniche as OM is oxidized) less of the OM in the niche is oxidized by sulphate and the peak \nreduces to a plateau where a balance is achieved between NO3- production and loss. We \nrecognise that this ammonia release may to some extent be retarded via uptake by OM-\noxidising bacteria, as depletions in porewater nutrients (phosphate) at microniches has been \nobserved.[13] Figure 5 represents graphically a plane of the 3-D data that can be produced from \nthe model output. It shows how the magnitude of the concentration in a 2-D image is very \ndependent on how close the plane is to the centre of the microniche. Data form this study \ncorroborate the hypothesis of Brandes and Devol,[15] that microniches may influence the \ngeneral porewater chemistry of sediments via diffusion extending away from the discrete \nsites. \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 18\nConclusions \nWe have developed a model that considers reactions and transport occurring in 3-D within a \nsediment. Its graphical user interface allows it to be used by geochemists without expert \nmodelling skills. Flexibility in the specification of reactions and the priority with which they \noccur facilitates detailed diagenetic modelling using a wide range of solutes and solid phases. \nSpherical microniches, where different rates and\/or concentrations produce a localized \nchemistry, may be specified. The model has been tested by separately verifying individual \nreaction types. Modelling of the hypothetical cases of microniches in the near surface \nsediment showed that, for the conditions selected, sulphide was readily generated, provided \nthe microniche diameter was greater than 1 mm.  \nAcknowledgments \nWe thank members of the European Union (EU) TREAD Programme for early input in model \ndevelopment and the EU for financial support.

They are usually very large (up to hundreds of megabytes depending on \nsimulation parameters and mesh complexity). Because it is impossible to interpret the 3-D \nresults directly in such a format, a Results module is provided to present them in a graphical \nform. Users can specify any x-y or y-x cross-section of the domain to be plotted as a set of \ncharts of concentration profiles (at that selected cross-section).  \nResolution Explained \nAs an approximation the resolution value can be assumed to be the minimum linear \nresolution resolved by the mesh. This is the case for the 3D-TREAD model as it uses \nmaximum element size (maximum distance between nodes in element MEL) as a mesh \nparameter in the GUI. If cubic elements were used then the linear resolution would be equal \nto the maximum distance (elements arranged as bricks). As the mesh in our model uses \ntetrahedrons, then on the boundary, resolution is approximately MEL, while inside the \ndomain it could be as high as ~MEL \/ 1.7.   \nFurther details on mesh implementation \nThe mesh, built of tetrahedral elements (each having four nodes), is interactively created to fit \nthe desired shape of sediment column by specifying the overall distribution of the x, y and z \ncoordinates. The nodes contain information about the porosity, , in the domain (and hence \ntortuosity by calculation) and the distribution of chemical components of defined \nconcentrations (represented in the form of a vector for each species). Reactions and transport \noccur within all parts of the mesh. The model state updates are calculated at each time step, \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 33\nwhich is specified by the user. Porosity can be specified for the entire domain as a function of \ndepth and separately for each microniche.  \nA microniche in the model is defined as a location of a spherical shape within the domain, \nspecified by the four values x, y, z, and R, where x, y and z are spatial coordinates and R is the \nradius. This specification of any microniches is transferred to the FEM mesh used for domain \nrepresentation. Although commonly considered for OM, microniches can be defined for any \nchemical component of the system. The user can specify microniches one-by-one using a \ndialog window that sets their positions, size (radius) and component concentration.  \nModel Implementation \nThe model was implemented in an Object Orientated fashion. Analysis of functionality was \nconducted to identify information carriers (such as species or reactions). Then all processes \nand routines were associated with appropriate data carriers based on their function. These \ninformation clusters objects are later used to define the calculation path for each \nsimulation. New reactions can be added to the application without interfering with any other \nobject (such as species or domain), allowing short implementation times and limited errors, \nwhile sustaining system stability. It allows easy and efficient modifications and optimisations \nof the built-in functionality, providing a framework for future extensions.   \nThe solving process takes advantage of the small time steps and the small size of the mesh \nelements. It exploits the superposition principle, so that at each time step we isolate the \nreaction equations from the transport equations and solve them in an interleaved manner. In \nother words, at each time step the reaction and the transport equations are solved sequentially. \nThis separation allows substantial flexibility in the reaction model. With this assumption, any \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 34\nreaction becomes an algebraic operation on a set of vectors of data. This approach allows \nintroduction of large number of reaction types without the constraints of the transport \ncalculation engine interface.  \nWe have used a uniform mesh for the model domain, where edges of the niche are not \nimplemented as discrete boundaries. An alternative approach is to introduce spherical \nsub-domains into the mesh, potentially allowing the specification of boundary conditions for \nthe microniche-sediment interface. Although providing much better precision to the model, it \nis very difficult to implement in such a dynamic environment, where microniches \n(sub-domains) may change in size (get smaller in time) and may be relocated at any time \n(simulation of particle relocation). Every such modification to the domain would require \nrecreating the mesh and initiating the solver - according to our tests, this can take as long as \n12% of the entire simulation time (when doing this once) depending on the number of \ntime-steps in simulation. After careful consideration `the uniform mesh approach was taken to \nallow easy definition and introduction of particle relocation mechanisms. Satisfactory results \ncan be obtained by decreasing the mesh size (finer resolution), which does not introduce \nmuch longer simulation times even with many components in the system. Moreover, this \napproach makes the simulation time independent of the number of microniches providing an \nexcellent opportunity to build and solve very complex heterogeneous systems (consisting of \nmultiple microniches) in hours.  \nSolutes are specified as porewater concentrations (per unit volume of solution) and the solid \nphases are specified as solid phase concentrations (per unit volume of dry sediment). As the \nmodel does not account for density of the solid phase, input concentrations relevant to solid \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 35\nphases need to be specified in volume units (of dry sediment) by prior correction using \ndensity (Eq. S1).  \nmmol g-1 \u00d7 dry weight density (g cm-3) = mmol cm-3 = M (mol L-1) (S1)  \nAdditional options for microniche specification \nA more advanced stochastic method has also been implemented, where a specified number of \nmicroniches are generated with predefined probability distributions (univariate, as a function \nof depth) for size, position and species concentrations of the simulated microniches.   \nIn another development a Monte Carlo technique can be optionally used to simulate the \neffects of mixing. This technique allows an exchange of two randomly chosen parts of the \nsediment matrix (the volume transferred is also randomly generated). Such processes mimic \nthe microniche creation when the locations chosen for exchange have different \nbiogeochemical characteristics.  \nExample equation for validation procedure  \n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 lim 2 lim 2 lim lim 2 lim 2 lim 2 lim\n[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ][ ][ ] 1 1 1 [ ][ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]OM s\nO MnO O O MnO OFeOOHd OM k OM t\nO MnO O FeOOH O MnO O\n  \nf1 f2 f3   \nFigure S2.

The fractional contribution of each primary reaction, \nfj, is shown (see equation 3). To calculate production or loss of the reactant or product of an \nindividual reaction with a single oxidant (e.g. Fe(II) in the case of FeOOH), the value of f for \nthat fraction only can be used. The product evolved from that reaction over a set time-scale \ncan then be calculated. The stoichiometry of the reaction equation also needs to be \nconsidered.   \n Access the published article via the DOI: http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1071\/EN08006 36\nTortuosity \nTortuosity ( ) is used to represent non linear diffusion induced by physical constraints caused \nby particles in sediment. Boudreau[5] plotted several empirical porosity-tortuosity \nrelationships together with observed values to determine those equations which gave the best \nfit. The three best fitting relationships are available in the model, together with a relationship \nrecently presented by Boudreau and Meysman (2006). An option is also available for \ntortuosity to be ignored. This may be useful if porosity is constant in a modelled domain and \nmanual calculation of tortuosity is required (to test other relationships for example). The \nequations and published best fit values are provided in Table S1.
